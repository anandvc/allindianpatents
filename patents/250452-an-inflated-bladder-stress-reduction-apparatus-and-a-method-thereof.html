I. Background of the Invention<br>
1. Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to water control gates and inflatable dams for control<br>
of water for use in conjunction with, but not limited to, dam spillways, hydroelectric<br>
projects, flood control structures, river diversions, irrigation canal check structures,<br>
roadway water barriers, levee crossings, parking garage water barriers, to inflatable<br>
actuators therefore, to inflatable actuators in general, to reinforced elastomeric hinges<br>
therefore, and to inflatable articles in general such as actuators for machines such as<br>
presses, dunnage bags, inflatable jacks, collapsible hoses and the like. The inflatable<br>
actuators herein disclosed may have many other applications, particularly where low cost,<br>
long life and reliability are important.<br>
2. Description of Related Art<br>
Various attempts have been made to develop economical water control gates. In<br>
many instances, the most economic water control gates are air actuated bottom hinged<br>
gates and inflatable dams. As but one advantage, the position of a plurality of water<br>
control gates can be infinitely adjusted by adjustment of the inflatable actuator pressures.<br>
Various patents relating to air-actuated bottom hinged gates and relating to inflatable dams<br>
are attached to this application and are hereby incorporated by reference. Various other<br>
materials relating to what may be prior art are also attached and are also hereby<br>
incorporated by reference. Hydraulically or mechanically operated gates are generally<br>
more expensive than the aforementioned air operated gates and inflatable dams.<br>
particularly if the cost of construction of required associated piers, equipment platforms,<br>
service cranes and bridges is accounted for. The limitations heretofore of inflatable dams<br>
have included high stresses at the downstream fold. In the case of inflatable dams<br>
manufactured from a single flat sheet, these stresses in the elastomeric material occur with<br>
the inflatable dam in the inflated configuration. Failure may result due to a combination<br>
of tensile stresses in the outermost layers due to bending of the dam body in conjunction<br>
with flow induced vibration associated with a rounded flexible surface from which flow<br>
may separate in an oscillatory manner. In the case of inflatable dams manufactured as a<br>
folded sheet, high tensile stresses may result in both the elastomeric inner-liner and in the<br>
inner most plies of reinforcing fabric when the dam is inflated. These high stresses in the<br>
reinforcing fabric may dictate that a high elongation fiber such as nylon be used even<br>
though nylon may have inferior long term water resistance compared to polyester, for<br>
example. The high stresses may generally lower the factor of safety or increase the overall<br>
cost of such an inflatable dam. Furthermore, even if reinforcement failure is avoided, high<br>
tensile stresses in the elastomeric inner-liner may result in cracking which may cause air<br>
leakage into the fiber reinforcement. This fiber reinforcement may be exposed at other<br>
locations resulting in gradual but undesirable air loss from the inflatable dam.<br>
Furthermore, inter-ply pressures may be increased, which may result in long-term oxygen<br>
degradation of the dam body and the susceptibility of the outer cover to blistering.<br>
The limitations heretofore of bottom hinged air actuated gates have been the<br>
requirement for custom field fitting of seals, the requirement for heating of abutment<br>
plates during icing conditions, and the somewhat higher cost, relative to benefits, of gates<br>
for low damming heights such as 2 meters or less. Specifically, with respect to gates for<br>
low damming heights such as 2 meters or less, the designs of the prior art have generally<br>
fallen into two categories. In the first category are designs such as those described in U.S.<br>
Patent 5,092,707 to Obermeyer, U.S. Patent 5,538,360 to Obermeyer, and U.S. Patent<br>
5,713,699 to Obermeyer et al. The designs of this first category call for a secondary<br>
vulcanization process for joining of the seam under the clamp bar. Secondary<br>
vulcanization processes (an additional, second vulcanizing process) may entail extra<br>
expense and may result in joints, which are less reliable than those created using a single<br>
stage vulcanization (merely one vulcanizing process) used in accordance with at least one<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Furthermore, said secondary vulcanization process<br>
can, at best, provide an elastomeric seal under the clamp bar. Continuit\ of<br>
circumferential reinforcement around the inflatable portion of the air bladder may not be<br>
accomplished by simply bonding and sealing the clamped joint in a secondary<br>
vulcanization step. Although the use of a wedge type clamping system as disclosed in U.S.<br>
Patent 5,709,502 to Obermeyer eliminates the requirement for a vulcanized joint under the<br>
clamp system, the clamp system itself may become relatively expensive as damming<br>
heights become lower.<br>
A disadvantage common to both inflatable dams with clamped unvulcanized joints<br>
and to air actuated bottom hinged gates with vulcanized joints is the phenomenon of creep<br>
of the elastomer compressed under the clamp system. Proper functioning of each system<br>
may generally rely on sufficient compressive stress under the clamp to prevent air leakage.<br>
The higher the compressive stress, the higher the associated shear stress becomes which,<br>
in turn, may lead to increased creep rates. Thus, the more securely such a clamp is<br>
tightened, the more often it may require re-tightening. Proper maintenance requires a<br>
careful balance between insufficient tightening which may result in leakage or system<br>
failure and excessive tightening which may lead to high rates of creep and also to system<br>
failure.<br>
Conventional inflatable dams may also be subject to vibration during over-topping<br>
conditions. Attempts have been made to aerate a nappe, leaving a fin by varying the<br>
dimensions of the fin or by providing discrete fins. Even with these mitigative measures,<br>
vibration may still be a problem under certain flow conditions.<br>
Additionally, the air fittings most commonly used in conjunction with air actuated<br>
bottom hinged gates and inflatable dams of the prior art may require protection during<br>
installation and may include sharp-machined edges. These sharp edges of these air fittings<br>
may damage or even penetrate adjacent air bladders if several air bladders are stacked for<br>
shipment or if such a fitting were to be installed prior to rolling up a long inflatable dam.<br>
Additionally, air actuated bottom hinged gates and inflatable dams of existing<br>
systems may generally not be well suited for vehicle or pedestrian traffic when in the<br>
lowered or deflated position. Conventional bottom hinged water control gates may be<br>
fitted with irregularly shaped hinges and reinforcing ribs which may not obstruct water<br>
flow but may pose a hazard or even a barrier to vehicular or pedestrian traffic.<br>
Conventional bottom hinged water control gates have also incorporated restraining<br>
straps, which may protrude from beneath the lowered gate panels. The protrusion of said<br>
restraining straps may be hazardous to pedestrian traffic. Such protruding restraining<br>
straps may be damaged by vehicular traffic. Furthermore, the protrusion of these<br>
restraining straps may be undesirable in certain water control applications even where<br>
traffic is not a design criterion.<br>
Conventional bottom hinged roadway and walkway water barriers have in some<br>
cases utilized mechanical hinges, which may be subject to leakage of water and corrosion<br>
and in some cases have used mechanical actuators, which may be subject to corrosion.<br>
Additionally, such mechanical hinges may require precise alignment, which may be<br>
expensive.<br>
Inflatable articles such as lifting bags (inflatable jacks), dock bumpers, hoses,<br>
inflatable dams and spillway gate actuators are typically manufactured by one of two<br>
methods. In the first method an internal mandrel or tool is used to define an internal<br>
surface with rounded edges. This method requires a secondary bonding operation or<br>
special device to seal the opening through which the mandrel or tool may be removed. In<br>
the second method, the interior is allowed to simply fold flat while the interior surfaces are<br>
prevented from bonding by means of a release film. This results in extreme stress<br>
concentrations of the inner liner in the inflated condition and, with multiple layers of<br>
reinforcement, extremely uneven load sharing between the layers of reinforcement. A<br>
third method utilizes three dimensional soluble mandrels of eutectic salts, aluminum,<br>
paper mache, etc. This type of soluble mandrel is expensive, time consuming, and in the<br>
case of salt, very fragile.<br>
Conventional spillway and navigation dam gates may be fitted with individual<br>
actuators or, in some instances, may be lifted to raised and locked positions one by one<br>
from a work boat or overhead cable hoist. Lifting the gates from overhead with either a<br>
boat or cableway may require dangerous work by highly skilled operators. Individual<br>
actuators may be too expensive for some projects. The use of very long spans of actuated<br>
water control gates in lieu of levees has often been cost prohibitive with existing systems.<br>
Conventional spillway gates often use nappe breakers to prevent vibration under<br>
conditions of small amounts of over-topping. Such nappe breakers are generally made of<br>
steel and are easily damaged by winter ice flows.<br>
II. Summary of Invention<br>
It is an object of this invention to provide a low-cost alternative to current water<br>
control gates for tow damming heights, which is easy to transport and install, and which<br>
does not require heated abutment plates for winter operation. It is another object of this<br>
invention to provide, in one type of embodiment, a gate system which may be driven over<br>
or walked upon without undue hazard or damage to the gate system. It is another object of<br>
this invention to provide a low cost flood control barrier, which may be suitable for<br>
spanning long distances.<br>
In accordance with at least one of this invention, an air bladder is provided which<br>
may be inflated, for quality control purposes for example, without the requirement that this<br>
air bladder be secured to a spillway or special test fixture.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of this invention, air bladders may contain plies<br>
of reinforcement which are continuous, except for any splices, around the circumference<br>
of said inflated air bladder and which may cross the joint connecting the inflated portions<br>
of said air bladders to the clamped portions of said air bladders. Said plies of<br>
reinforcement which are continuous may prevent de-lamination of the bonded layers of<br>
reinforcement which extend under the clamp bar while the air bladder is pressurized and<br>
the clamp is either not yet installed or is not clamped tightly. De-lamination, which can<br>
occur in some conventional designs, may reduce structural integrity or cause leakage.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, air bladders may be vulcanized in a<br>
single stage vulcanization process and may not require any secondary vulcanization steps.<br>
Such single stage vulcanization may enhance overall structural integrity and may<br>
minimize manufacturing costs.<br>
According to another aspect of this invention, air bladders may be secured to a dam<br>
spillway, for example, with a simple rectangular clamp bar. This simple rectangular<br>
5<br>
damp bar may be less expensive, easier to install and require less space than alternative<br>
clamping systems. Space on existing spillways to which such gate systems may be<br>
retrofitted may be severely restricted.<br>
According to another aspect of this invention, air bladders may be provided with<br>
precisely molded ends to which matching inter-panel seals and abutment seals may be<br>
fitted to create a leak tight assembly with minimal installation time.<br>
According to another aspect of this invention, an integral hinge flap may be<br>
provided which may conform tightly to the downstream face of aforementioned clamp bar.<br>
With such a configuration, the trapping of sand or gravel between the hinge flap and the<br>
clamp bar may be avoided. Sand and gravel trapped between the hinge flap and the clamp<br>
bar may, during actuation of a gate system over time, damage the hinge flap or remove<br>
corrosion protection from the clamp bar.<br>
According to another aspect of this invention, air bladders may be provided with<br>
air fittings which lack damaging or damageable protrusions. This may be accomplished<br>
with a fitting, which may be entirely contained within the lower membrane of an inflatable<br>
air bladder as herein disclosed.<br>
According to another aspect of this invention, air fittings may be generally disk<br>
shaped and may feature a connection such as pipe threads at a centrally located through-<br>
hole.<br>
According to another aspect of this invention, air fittings may feature a tapered<br>
profile which may limit undesirable changes in direction of reinforcing fabric. Excessive<br>
changes in direction of reinforcing fabric may cause delamination of the layers of the<br>
reinforcing from each other or disbonding of the reinforcing from the embedded air fitting.<br>
According to another aspect of this invention, air fittings may feature rounded<br>
outer edges, which may prevent the fitting from cutting aforementioned reinforcing fabric.<br>
According to another aspect of this invention, the radius of the rounded outer edges<br>
may be sufficiently small such that the formation of voids in the elastomer and the direct<br>
contact of reinforcing cords with the air fitting may be avoided.<br>
According to another aspect of this invention, the air fittings may be made of (in<br>
part or whole) or coated with a material which bonds to the elastomeric body of said<br>
inflatable bladder during vulcanization.<br>
According to another aspect of this invention, said air fittings may be made of<br>
brass.<br>
According to another aspect of this invention, inter-panel seals may be provided<br>
with a bend in cross-section to enhance flexibility in installations where the distance<br>
between adjoining gate panels varies with gate actuation angle, such as on a spillway<br>
which is curved in plan view.<br>
According to another aspect of this invention, interpanel seals may be provided<br>
which may be identical or similar in profile to the clamped edge of the associated air<br>
bladder. In this manner, the inter-panel seals and air bladder may be simultaneously<br>
secured to a dam spillway with the same clamp arrangement.<br>
According to another aspect of this invention, abutment seals may be provided<br>
which may be identical or similar in profile to the clamped edge of the associated air<br>
bladder. In this manner, the abutment seals and air bladder may be simultaneously<br>
secured to a dam spillway with the same clamp arrangement.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, elastomeric abutment seals<br>
may be provided with a bonded low friction wear surface such as polyethylene or PTFE,<br>
for example.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, a polyethylene wear surface is co-<br>
vulcanized to a reinforced elastomer containing EPDM (ethylene-propoylene-diene-<br>
methylene rubber).<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, a polyethylene wear surface<br>
is co-vulcanized to a reinforced elastomer comprised of a blend including EPDM and<br>
Chlorobutyl.<br>
According to another aspect of this invention, an abutment plate may be provided<br>
which has low thermal conductivity and low adhesion to ice.<br>
According to yet another aspect of this invention, said abutment plate may be<br>
provided with a large number of fasteners and may have a relatively large thickness so as<br>
to prevent buckling (including warping) which might otherwise result due to the low<br>
modulus and high coefficient of thermal expansion of materials such as polyethylene.<br>
According to another aspect of this invention, the fastener spacing to thickness<br>
ratio may be approximately 20 to 1 or less, and is preferably no greater than 12 to I<br>
(perhaps 8 to 1). In this manner, buckling of the abutment plates when exposed to direct<br>
sunlight may be* avoided. Buckling is generally undesirable because a leak path may be<br>
opened up behind the abutment plate. This leak path may not entirely re-close due to<br>
creep of the abutment plate material or the lodging of debris. Buckling is also undesirable<br>
because it may interfere with free travel of the adjoining gate panel and seal assembly.<br>
According to another aspect of this invention the fasteners may be recessed below<br>
the surface of said abutment plates.<br>
According to another aspect of this invention, the fasteners may be covered with a<br>
polyethylene plug or auto body filler like material to leave a smooth surface against which<br>
a gate abutment seals may travel.<br>
According to another aspect of this invention, a groove may be provided around<br>
the periphery of each of several abutment plate segments so as to allow the placement and<br>
retention of sealant.<br>
According to another aspect of this invention, the abutment plate material may<br>
contain a dark pigment such as carbon black to facilitate solar heating and to block<br>
ultraviolet radiation, which could damage a polymer such as polyethylene.<br>
8<br>
According to another aspect of the invention the abutment plate material may be<br>
ultra high molecular weight (UHMW) polyethylene.<br>
According to another aspect of this invention the abutment plate may be comprised<br>
of high density polyethylene.<br>
According to another aspect of this invention, the abutment plates may incorporate<br>
reinforcement such as fiberglass which has low thermal conductivity yet ma\ confer<br>
stiffness to the abutment plates.<br>
According to another aspect of this invention, a heated seal assembly or other<br>
heating means (or, perhaps even, heating element) may be attached to and movable with a<br>
gate panel associated with the aforementioned low thermal conductivity abutment plate.<br>
According to another aspect of this invention, an inflatable dam may be provided<br>
which, although vulcanized in a folded "deflated" position, features a prescribed finite<br>
internal radius along the interior of the downstream edge. This internal radius may be<br>
formed, for example, with a removable tool, a soluble tool, or with an extruded<br>
elastomeric profile which may be left in place after manufacture.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, the undamped edges of an<br>
inflatable article such as an inflatable actuator for a water control gate or the body of a<br>
rubber dam may incorporate an elastomeric profile which may be extruded and pre-cured<br>
and then subsequently bonded over a portion of its profile to the interior marginal edges of<br>
the inflatable article. This elastomeric profile may be "tear drop" shaped and may feature<br>
a hole through its center. This hole may be used to locate the profile during manufacture,<br>
or may be used as a crush-resistant air supply manifold. The elastomeric profile may be<br>
bonded to the interior of the inflatable article along one side, while the rounded surface<br>
and opposite flat side remain un-bonded. In this manner, the article may be inflated<br>
without being constrained by the profile. Furthermore, a desirable as-molded rounded<br>
shape is imparted to the interior of the inflatable article, and the need to remove a tool<br>
used for the same purpose is eliminated. Portions of said profile may be selectively<br>
bonded with rubber cement, for example, or selectively caused to not bond by the use of<br>
9<br>
release film or agent, in accordance with the compounds and methods used for<br>
manufacture.<br>
The economics of some projects may prohibit the use of individual actuators for<br>
each gate panel. Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide a water control<br>
gate system that may provide the safe remote actuation capability of more expensive<br>
systems with individual gate actuators, while retaining the economy of simple manualloperated gates.<br>
It is a further object of this invention to provide a method of construction that may<br>
be economical for large scale gates.<br>
It is another object of this invention to provide gate panels that may be adapted to<br>
also serve as a roadway, walkway, or railroad bed surface.<br>
It is another object of this invention to provide a water control gate system that<br>
may provide for easy and reliable pneumatic actuation yet may also provide a smooth and<br>
safe upper surface for vehicular and pedestrian traffic.<br>
It is another object of this invention to provide a method of construction that may<br>
be economical for a wide range of gate heights.<br>
It is also an object of this invention to provide a gate hinge mechanism that may<br>
have a high load rating without the requirement for precision rotating bearings, which<br>
might require time consuming and expensive field alignment procedures.<br>
It is another object of this invention to provide a hinge mechanism that may also<br>
serve as a seal which may prevent fluids, particles or contaminates from passing through<br>
the hinge assembly.<br>
It is another object of this invention to provide a flexible barrier, which may<br>
protect the hinge mechanism from corrosive fluids or gasses and may protect the hinge<br>
mechanism from abrasive or damaging particles.<br>
10<br>
It is the further object of this invention to provide a hinge that may allow shear<br>
loads between the two hinged objects to be transmitted from the flexible cable, cord or<br>
fibrous elements to the rigid elements by a bonded chemical connection.<br>
It is the further object of this invention that said bonded chemical connection<br>
provides an elastic connection, which serves to reduce stress concentrations and optimize<br>
the ability of the assembly to accommodate misalignmeni and absorb dynamic loads<br>
without damage. Such an elastic connection may be manufactured using a vulcanizable<br>
elastomer such as EPDM, butyl rubber, natural rubber, styrene butadiene rubber, nitrite<br>
rubber, chloroprene rubber or blends thereof.<br>
It is the further object of this invention to configure flexible and preferably twisted<br>
cords, cables or other means so as to resist loads in any direction in the plane normal to the<br>
hinge axis and to be able to resist shear loads parallel to the hinge axis, while providing<br>
little resistance to rotation about the hinge axis within the angular design limits of the<br>
hinge.<br>
It is the further object of this invention to utilize pre-assembled groups of cords<br>
such as strips of unidirectional tire cord fabric, preferable embedded in rubber or other<br>
elastomer.<br>
It is the further object of this invention to provide an un-bonded zone between the<br>
rigid hinge elements and the flexible elements in the region of rolling contact.<br>
It is the further object of this invention to provide smooth rounded edges adjacent<br>
the flexible cord elements both in the zone of rolling contact and at the edges where the<br>
flexible elements reverse directions.<br>
It is the further object of this invention to provide robust mechanical support to the<br>
portion of the rigid elements around which the flexible elements wrap, preferably by<br>
approximately SO % solid material for support and approximately 50% slotted length for<br>
wrapping of the reverse bend of said flexible elements.<br>
A still further object of this invention is to provide a low friction and low wear<br>
robust hinge mechanism which does not require hard metallic or ceramic surfaces but for<br>
which the rigid elements may be fabricated of light weight fiber reinforced composites<br>
such as carbon fiber, aramid fiber, ceramic fibers or glass fibers in a matrix of epoxy.<br>
polyester, etc.<br>
A still further object of this invention is to provide the lowered gate panels with<br>
mechanical support through transmission of compressive bearing loads through the<br>
deflated air bladders.<br>
A further object of this invention is to provide a smooth upper surface in<br>
conjunction with a water control gate so as to prevent the entrapment of sediment, debris<br>
or other solids, which could hinder the free flow of water.<br>
A further object of this invention is to provide a smooth surface, which does not<br>
present a danger to recreational water uses such as raft, kayak, and canoe passage.<br>
A further object of this invention is to provide a smooth and safe surface for users<br>
of swimming facilities and amusement park water features. Such a smooth surface may be<br>
molded of vulcanizable elastomers such as EPDM, Butyl rubber, natural rubber, styrene<br>
butadiene rubber, nitrite rubber, or blends thereof, for example.<br>
A still further object of this invention is to provide a compact enclosed hinge<br>
mechanism which requires no sliding surfaces subject to contamination by abrasives and<br>
wear.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a smooth surface fixed to the bottom<br>
of a concrete gate panel against which the air bladder can slide without excessive wear or<br>
friction. Such a smooth surface may be manufactured from UHMW polyethylene in<br>
conjunction with suitable concrete anchors, for example.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a smooth low friction corner under<br>
the upstream edge of the gate panel around which the inflated air bladder can slide without<br>
12<br>
excessive friction or wear. Such a corner piece may be manufactured from nylon or<br>
UHMW polyethylene rod, for example.<br>
A further embodiment of this invention is an articulated gate mounted by a hinge<br>
to a mounting element within a roadway or walkway and actuated by inflatable actuators<br>
located under the articulated panels of said gate system. The inflatable actuators may be<br>
shimmed after installation to transmit compressive loads from the lowered gate panels<br>
downward to the foundation slab. For large scale installations, the gate panels are<br>
preferably constructed in place of reinforced concrete. This eliminates the need not only<br>
for transport of heavy gate panels to the site, but also to relocate the completed gate panels<br>
after they are manufactured.<br>
Another aspect of this invention is to provide a water control gate system wherein<br>
the restraining straps may be located between the ends of adjacent air bladders and,<br>
optionally, between air bladders adjacent abutments and these abutments. This<br>
arrangement may allow the simultaneous use of large low pressure air bladders in<br>
conjunction with restraining straps which may be sufficiently short to remain covered and<br>
protected by the gate panels when said gate panels are in a fully lowered position. Large<br>
low pressure air bladders may be generally desirable in that their use generally reduces<br>
reaction forces at the associated hinge assembly, reduces gate panel loading, and reduces<br>
loads within said air bladders themselves.<br>
Another aspect of this invention is to provide dummy inserts, made of elastomeric<br>
material similar to that from which the air bladders are manufactured, for example, within<br>
the clamping system to replace the air bladders at locations where said air bladders may be<br>
truncated to provide clearance space for restraining straps. In some cases, a radius which<br>
may be provided in the as-manufactured shape in conjunction with the inflated radius of<br>
adjoining air bladders may provide sufficient clearance for said restraining straps.<br>
A further object of this invention is to provide a flood protection barrier means (or.<br>
perhaps even, flood protection barrier element) for a railroad which may lie below flood<br>
level, such as in the case of a railway passing through a levee. Specifically this invention<br>
may allow for rails to be attached to and supported by gate panels which may, in turn, be<br>
supported through an inflatable actuator by the underlying foundation.<br>
13<br>
It is another aspect of this invention to provide articulated segments of rail which<br>
can slide over the fixed rails as the gate panel and its rail segments are raised.<br>
A further object of this invention is to provide a smooth surface out of cast-in-<br>
place polyurethane, for example, over a gate clamp system which would otherwise not be<br>
flat.<br>
A further object of this invention is the use of a cover plate to provide a smooth<br>
surface over the clearance gap above the hinge, which gap may be necessary for the<br>
hinged angular upward motion of the gate. Said cover plate may be Fixed with a hinge at<br>
one edge and may be supported at the opposite edge in such a manner that it may slide as<br>
the gate is raised and lowered. The preferred arrangement is to provide a cover plate<br>
which may be pivotably mounted to the gate panel and which may be able to slide in an<br>
upstream direction over the clamp area as the gate panel is raised.<br>
A still further object of this invention is to provide sufficiently large gate panels<br>
such that seal leakage between individual gate panels may not be a significant problem.<br>
Another aspect of this invention is a movable actuator that may be positioned and<br>
operated safely from a remote dry location. A single actuator may be used to lift,<br>
sequentially for example, a large quantity of individual gate panels or segments. After<br>
lifting, each gate panel or segment may be held in the raised position by a restraint such as<br>
an inexpensive mechanical strut, latch or tension member. These restraints may be<br>
designed to release automatically in response to high upstream levels or increased<br>
hydrostatic loads on the gate.<br>
For some flood control applications, the gate panels may preferably be constructed<br>
in place of reinforced concrete, thus eliminating the need, not only for transport to the site,<br>
but also possibly eliminating the need to relocate or lift the gate panels at all once they are<br>
manufactured.<br>
Another aspect of one embodiment of the present invention is the casting of<br>
concrete gate panels so as to incorporate the associated hinge elements into said gate<br>
14<br>
panels. The expense of hinge fasteners and the expense of labor otherwise required for<br>
fastening hinges to finished gate panels may be thus avoided.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention is the provision of flexible nappe breakers<br>
(or aerators) which may resist damage due to ice flows. These flexible nappe breakers<br>
may be manufactured from reinforced elastomers, for example.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention is the provision of vertically extended<br>
inter-panel seals or abutment seals which may also serve as flexible nappe breakers.<br>
III. Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
Note that the following drawings relate to one or more embodiment only and arc<br>
not in any way to limit the invention, embodiments thereof, claims, or elements thereof.<br>
Other objects, advantages and capabilities of the present invention will become apparent<br>
as the description proceeds taken in conjunction with the following drawings in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a cut-away view of an inflatable jack. Inflatable membrane 3 wraps around<br>
extruded member 2. Air may be supplied through pre-molded shape 1 through hose<br>
Figure 2 is a cut-away plan view of the inflatable jack depicted in Figure 1. Inflatable<br>
membrane 3 encloses extruded member 2<br>
Figure 3 is a section identified in Figure 2. Extruded member 2 is bonded along surface 8<br>
to inflatable membrane 3, but not bonded along surface 7, nor along the circular surface of<br>
contact 9. Hole S allows transmission of pressurized fluid (e.g. pressurized air) around the<br>
periphery of the inflatable jack. The air may pass from continuous, longitudinal hole 5 out<br>
through vent holes 6<br>
Figures 4, S, 6, and 7 depict an optional pre-molded elastomeric fitting, which adapts an<br>
external hose to the internal stress relief profile.<br>
Figure 8 shows a cross section of an inflatable jack in a deflated condition.<br>
15<br>
Figure 9 shows an inflatable jack in the inflated condition with the stress relief profile<br>
secured to the side of the inflated device.<br>
Figure 10 shows an inflatable dam body in the deflated condition. Inflatable membrane 3<br>
is secured by wedges lla, lib, lie, lid, and lie at upstream end 10. Insert (or<br>
circumferentially continuous, or integrally adjoined, or joint traversing) layer 12 prevents<br>
tearing if the envelope is inflated without external clamping forces. Fin 14 includes fin<br>
insert IS under reinforcement layer 16.<br>
Figure 11 is the inflatable dam of Figure 10 in the inflated configuration. Inflatable<br>
membrane 3 holds fin 14 and stress relief extrusion 2 in position. Dam-to-spillway clamp<br>
17 holds the inflatable dam to spillway foundation 18 (a spillway).<br>
Figure 12 shows another embodiment of an inflatable dam, using a simple rectangular<br>
clamp 118 in conjunction with "comma" insert 21 and anti-tear reinforcement 12. The<br>
thickened portion of the inflatable membrane 3 containing stress relief shape 2 and fin<br>
insert IS lies within a recess in the spillway 22. Nut 20 holds clamp 118 onto anchor bolt<br>
19. The air connection 24 to the inflatable dam may be connected to hollow extrusion S<br>
by means of a molded groove 23 that provides a clearance space for air between upper and<br>
lower adjacent portions of deflated membrane 3. Expressed in more general terms, a<br>
segment of at least one layer of the inflatable bladder membrane 1002 may be adapted to<br>
surround a spatial void (that may be termed a membrane spatial void) that is fluidically<br>
responsive to a spatial void 1003 formed by the air supply fitting (or pressurized fluid<br>
element) 24 and to a longitudinal spatial void S enclosed by the longitudinal spatial void<br>
enclosing insert element 1004. The membrane spatial void may also be fluidicly<br>
responsive to a bladder interior-to-longitudinal spatial void fluid conveyance hole. The<br>
inflatable dam may be rendered less prone to flow induced vibration damage when<br>
deflated by lowering the internal pressure to below atmospheric pressure by means of a<br>
vacuum system connected to air supply fitting 24. This causes tight adherence of<br>
membrane 3 to insert 2, resulting in a stiffer structure at a location known for damage<br>
problems with conventional designs.<br>

Figure 13 is an inflatable dam similar to that shown in Figure 12 in the inflated<br>
configuration. Insert 21 provides positive engagement to clamp bar 118. Recess 22 can<br>
be seen on spillway 18.<br>
Figure 14 is a cross section of a pneumatic spillway gate in accordance with the present<br>
invention. Relief groove 23 connects air fitting 24 to hollow stress relief extrusion 2.<br>
Gate panel 24 is secured to hinge flap 25 by means of hinge retainer 26.<br>
Figure IS shows the deflated air bladder of the spillway gate shown in Figure 14.<br>
"Comma-" type Insert member 21 is located upstream of flat portion 28. Holes 29 through<br>
flat portion 28 permit assembly with the clamp bar 118 of Figure 14. The enlarged portion<br>
27 of the hinge flap 25 prevents the hinge flap from pulling out from under the hinge<br>
retainer 26 of Figure 14. Anti tearing layer 12 prevents rupture of the air bladder under<br>
undamped or loosely clamped conditions.<br>

IV. Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
At least one embodiment of the present invention may utilize an inflated bladder<br>
stress reduction apparatus such as an extruded profile or insert which may be elastomeric<br>
in at least one embodiment and which may remain secured to the interior surface of an<br>
inflatable article (a general term used to define any inflatable object, apparatus, structure<br>
or product) when the article is inflated. This configuration may eliminate the need to<br>
remove or dissolve a profiled tool or mandrel during the manufacturing process (but the<br>
insert may indeed be removable (as simply by force, or dissolvable) if such is desired - the<br>
fact that the element is termed an insert does not preclude its removal or dissolving from<br>
the inflatable apparatus because in all cases it serves as an insert, although when it is<br>
dissolved or removed it serves as an insert only temporarily). One face on a tear drop<br>
shaped extruded profile, which may be more generally referred to as a substantially<br>
elongated, substantially cross-sectionally drop-shaped, deflated bladder fold membrane<br>
insert element (which may be as indicated by part (2) in at least one embodiment) or an<br>
inflated stress relief insert (2) (or just stress relief insert, or longitudinal insert element)<br>
may remain bonded to a part of the interior surface (a part of the inner deflated bladder<br>
fold membrane surface) (8) of the inflatable article, while the curved surface (9) and<br>
25<br>
remaining face (7) (which may be flat) may be prevented from bonding during<br>
manufacturing by use of a release film, use of a release agent, or by omission of a bonding<br>
agent, as but a few examples. The term elastomeric as used herein and throughout this<br>
discussion is defined to have an elastic limit of greater than or equal to 10%, meaning that<br>
it has a reversible elongation of at least 10% (or, in other words, a less than 10 %<br>
elongation will not cause plastic deformation). Relatedly, it is important to understand<br>
that the term bladder is intended to include any apparatus that substantially expands (i.e..<br>
expands beyond mere de minimus expansion of certain pressurizable but non-expanding<br>
articles such as metallic oxygen tanks) upon internal pressurization. When an element is<br>
limited as elastomeric, it need not be elastomeric in every possible elongation direction,<br>
but merely at least one. Indeed, an elastomeric material can include materials that are not<br>
elastomeric, as long as the resultant product is elastomeric in at least one direction.<br>
It is important to understand that every reference to a part of a figure (as 2 above)<br>
is intended only to indicate but one example of the part or element that the reference seeks<br>
to clarify. The reference is not intended to indicate that the referenced part or element is<br>
the only shape, size, type or configuration that would suffice to accomplish the desired<br>
function but instead is merely intended as an example of a part or element that would<br>
adequately perform the desired task or properly serve or function as that element. The<br>
substantially elongated, substantially cross-sectionally drop-shaped, deflated bladder fold<br>
membrane insert element (2) (or simply inflated stress relief insert element or stress relief<br>
insert element) may operate in the capacity of a minimum deflated bladder fold membrane<br>
curvature radius increase element. The term drop shaped (in cross-section) is intended to<br>
represent a wide variety of shapes, with the only requirement being that one portion of the<br>
drop is substantially curved while the opposite side of the drop is substantially an<br>
intersection of two lines (although that intersection need not be a point). Further, the term<br>
drop-shaped is intended to encompass drops that are not symmetric about any cross-<br>
sectional axis (in addition to those that are symmetric about one cross-sectional axis). The<br>
term substantially elongated is intended to include elements that, either alone or in<br>
combination with other similar adjacently positioned elements, are longer than they are<br>
cross-sectionally widest, and includes straight and curved elements. It is also important to<br>
note that the term element is intended to include not only one of the indicated type of<br>
structure or otherwise, but also a plurality of the indicated type of structure or otherwise.<br>
For example, the substantially elongated substantially cross-sectionally drop-shaped,<br>
26<br>
deflated bladder fold membrane insert element may be one insert along one edge and a<br>
second insert along a second edge. This intended use of the term element applies<br>
throughout the application.<br>
The deflated bladder fold is one of the possibly plural number of folds that may<br>
appear in the inflatable membrane when the inflatable article is deflated. The term is<br>
intended to refer to that portion of the inflatable membrane that folds in a deflated<br>
configuration and thus exists even in an inflated configuration, referring in that situation to<br>
the membrane portion that folds in a deflated configuration. This definitional approach is<br>
taken precisely because it is the cross-sectional shape and size of the deflated fold that<br>
governs the nature, magnitude and concentration of the stresses that the internal<br>
pressurized fluid imparts to the deflated fold membrane in an inflated configuration.<br>
Indeed, as one might expect, the smaller the radius of curvature of the deflated fold<br>
membrane, the greater the stresses at that membrane in an inflated configuration. Further,<br>
given that the deflated fold membrane exhibits perhaps the sharpest of all cross-sectional<br>
curves in the deflated configuration, and given that these bends represent the relaxed<br>
configuration shape that the pressurized internal fluid must reconfigure and from which<br>
the pressurized article must deviate, the deflated fold membrane is typically the most<br>
prone to an excessive internal pressure induced failure, one reason for this being that its<br>
eventual inflated shape represents the greatest deviation from its relaxed, deflation<br>
configuration shape. In at least one embodiment of the invention,, a minimum deflated<br>
bladder fold membrane curvature radius increase element seeks to prevent or at least delay<br>
failure at the inflatable bladder's (or inflatable bladder element's) most vulnerable area -<br>
the deflated bladder fold membane - by increasing the radius of curvature of the deflated<br>
fold membrane in its inflated configuration by increasing it in its deflated configuration.<br>
Relevantly, one cause of the tight cross sectional deflated bladder curve may be<br>
considered to be manufacturing methods that vulcanize the bladder in a deflated,<br>
substantially flat configuration that may necesssarily (or intentionally) include tight folds,<br>
each with a small radius of curvature. Also, in a deflated configuration of at least one<br>
embodiment of the invention, the substantially elongated, substantially cross-sectionally<br>
drop-shaped, deflated bladder fold membrane insert element 2 may be viewed as a<br>
deflated bladder storage facilitation element because it may enable a deflated<br>
configuration manufacture of the bladder (that otherwise, without the insert 2, would not<br>
be possible because of the unacceptably tight, inflation failure inducing folds) that in turn<br>
27<br>
results in a bladder that relaxes into deflated configuration and assumes a roughly similar,<br>
predictable deflated configuration. Further, the substantially elongated, substantially<br>
cross-sectionally drop-shaped, deflated bladder fold membrane insert element 2 may act to<br>
facilitate storage also in that it allows the expanded profile, deflated bladder fold (in a<br>
deflated configuration) to withstand pressures arising from abutting or adjacently stored<br>
deflated bladders (as in a coil), or that arise from the placement of any items proximately<br>
to the deflated bladder. Without insert 2, (or if the deflated fold membrane has not been<br>
positively conformed to have an increased minimum radius of curvature) the storage<br>
pressures (e.g., arising from a coil) may cause structural damage to the deflated fold<br>
membrane. It is important to realize that some manufacturing processes may create non-<br>
linear folds in order to create the desired inflatable article shape.<br>
Again, any figures or description thereof appearing in this application are of at<br>
least one embodiment and are not to be read to limit in any way the invention or<br>
embodiments thereof or any claims that may appear or elements thereof. Referring now to<br>
Figure 1, a cut-away view of such an inflatable article is shown. Inflatable bladder<br>
membrane 3 wraps around the substantially elongated, substantially cross-sectionally<br>
drop-shaped, deflated bladder fold membrane insert element (which may be an extruded<br>
member or extrusion) 2. Air may be supplied through pre-molded shape 1 through hose<br>
(or more generally, pressurized fluid conveyer) 4. In at least one embodiment, the insert<br>
element 2 may be elastomeric, but other suitable materials (such as polymers, e.g.) are<br>
deeemed within the ambit of the inventive subject matter.<br>
Referring now to Figure 2, a cut-away plan view of the inflatable article depicted<br>
in Figure 1 is shown. Inflatable membrane 3 encloses extruded member 2. Extruded<br>
member 2 preferably extends around the perimeter of inflatable article 3a. Corner member<br>
(or, termed differently, substantially cross-sectionally drop-shaped, deflated bladder corner<br>
fold membrane insert element) 1 may act to relieve inflated stresses at the corners. Air or<br>
other fluid may be introduced through corner member 1 or by other means such as tubes,<br>
hoses or bulkhead type fittings or, alternatively, through an improved fitting hereinafter<br>
described.<br>
The substantially elongated, substantially cross-sectionally drop-shaped, deflated<br>
28<br>
bladder fold membrane insert element may be viewed as comprising several parts.<br>
Specifically, it may comprise a substantially elongated, smooth cross-sectionally curved,<br>
half-cylinder shaped, inner deflated bladder fold membrane surface contactable element<br>
(which is that surface part of the insert that can contact the half-circular inner fold<br>
membrane in a deflated configuration); two substantially opposing, substantially planar,<br>
inner deflated bladder fold adjacent membrane surface contactable elements 1006 that are<br>
responsive to the substantially elongated, smooth cross-sectionally curved, half-cylinder<br>
shaped, inner deflated bladder fold membrane surface contactable element; an inner<br>
deflated bladder fold adjacent membrane surface contactable element intersection vertex<br>
element that is responsive to said two substantially opposing, substantially planar, inner<br>
deflated bladder fold adjacent membrane surface contactable elements; and a deflated<br>
bladder fold membrane insert element body element established internally of each said<br>
substantially elongated, smooth cross-sectionally curved, half-cylinder shaped, inner<br>
deflated bladder fold membrane surface contactable element, said two substantially<br>
opposing, substantially planar, inner deflated bladder fold adjacent membrane surface<br>
contactable elements, and said inner deflated bladder fold adjacent membrane surface<br>
contactable element intersection vertex element. The substantially elongated, smooth<br>
cross-sectionally curved, half-cylinder shaped, inner deflated bladder fold membrane<br>
surface contactable element 9 is a part that contacts the inner deflated fold membrane<br>
surface and that is half-cylinder shaped (where such cylinder is not restricted merely to<br>
circular cross-sections). It also has a smooth cross-sectional curve that the inner deflated<br>
bladder fold membrane surface may contact, at least in a deflated configuration. The two<br>
substantially opposing, substantially planar, inner deflated bladder fold adjacent<br>
membrane surface contactable elements 1006 are each configured to contact a surface(s)<br>
of the inner deflated bladder membrane that is adjacent 1008 to the inner deflated fold<br>
membrane 1007 (typically these surfaces would run alongside the deflated bladder fold<br>
membrane). Even an undulating surface may be substantially planar, as long as all curves<br>
are smooth in cross-section (also note that each of the elements is substantially planar - it<br>
is not necessarily the case that the two elements are substantially of the same plane). The<br>
two elements may be substantially opposing even though their planes are tilted with<br>
respect to one another. The inner deflated bladder fold adjacent membrane surface<br>
contactable element intersection vertex element is the intersection of the two inner<br>
deflated bladder fold adjacent membrane surface contactable elements at a vertex several<br>
of which together may be substantially linear (possibly even curved). Note that all surface<br>
29<br>
contactable elements refer to the part of the insert that is located at the surface of the<br>
insert. The deflated bladder fold membrane insert element body element may be<br>
established internally of the other above-mentioned insert parts. The deflated bladder fold<br>
membrane insert element is intended to cover not only the case where there is clearly a<br>
structure internal of the surface contactable elements (and the intersection vertex element,<br>
which may contact an inner membrane surface or not), but also the case where the<br>
required structural rigidity of the insert element is provided by, e.g.. strong material<br>
surface contactable elements (and the intersection vertex element) of a hollow insert. In<br>
such a case, the surface contactable elements would be the very surface of the strong<br>
material. The deflated bladder fold membrane insert element body element would, in the<br>
case of a hollow insert, be the sub-surface material.<br>
Cross section 3-3 identified in Figure 2 is shown in Figure 3. Extruded shape 2 (at<br>
majority surficial portion of one of the two substantially opposing, substantially planar,<br>
inner deflated bladder fold adjacent membrane surface contactable elements) is bonded (or<br>
adhered) along surface 8 to a portion' 1005 of inner deflated bladder fold membrane<br>
surface 3 (that portion being a deflated bladder fold adjacent membrane surface), but is not<br>
bonded along surface 7, nor along the possibly circular arc surface 9. Note that a majority<br>
surficial portion of one of the two substantially opposing, substantially planar, inner<br>
deflated bladder fold adjacent membrane surface contactable elements may also be<br>
adhereable to a deflated bladder fold membrane surface (i.e., the inner membrane of the<br>
fold bend itself). Hole S, more generally a longitudinal spatial void may be used to allow<br>
transmission of inflation gas or fluid around the periphery of the inflatable article via a<br>
longitudinal spatial void enclosing deflated bladder fold membrane insert element 1009.<br>
Thus, the insert element may be a compressed fluid conveyable, longitudinal spatial void<br>
enclosing deflated bladder fold membrane insert element. Said gas or fluid may pass from<br>
continuous hole S out through vent holes 6, or what may be termed a bladder interior-to-<br>
longitudinal spatial void fluid conveyance hole that is fluidicly responsive to the<br>
longitudinal spatial void that may be found in insert element 1009.<br>
Different types of inflatable articles may have stress relief insert(s) along different<br>
numbers and configurations of deflated bladder fold membranes. For example, inflatable<br>
bladders of each of the following: fluid conveyance hose 1010; inflatable elastomeric dam<br>
1011; expansion hose 1010; inflatable jack (a type of apparatus used in elevate an item<br>
30<br>
upon inflation); dock bumper; inflatable water gate panel (perhaps inflatable bottom-<br>
hinged water gate panel) actuator apparatus 1012; dunnage bag; and the inflatable seal<br>
(some type of apparatus that seals upon inflation) may each have stress relief inserts along<br>
two longitudinal, substantially parallel deflated bladder fold membranes, or along four<br>
rectangularly situated deflated bladder fold membranes, or along one smooth continuous<br>
(a circle, or oval, as but two examples) deflated bladder fold membrane; or along one<br>
deflated bladder end fold membrane and two parallel, deflated bladder fold membranes<br>
orthogonal to the one end fold membrane, as but a few examples. The inflatable<br>
eiastomeric dam and the inflatable water gate panel (perhaps inflatable bottom- hinged<br>
water gate panel) actuator apparatus may further (in alternate embodiments) have stress<br>
relief inserts) along the following: one overflow orthogonal, longitudinal (meaning<br>
having a length) deflated bladder fold membrane; one overflow orthogonal, longitudinal<br>
deflated bladder fold membrane and two parallel, overflow aligned deflated bladder end<br>
fold membranes. The term overflow orthogonal (or overflow aligned) is defined to<br>
indicate an orientation that is orthogonal to (or aligned with) the direction of overflow if it<br>
were to occur. An inflatable water gate panel actuator membrane 1013 may be configured<br>
to rotate a water gate panel about an upstream leading edge of the gate panel (see Figure<br>
14) or a downstream leading edge of the gate panel (see Figure 101).<br>
Referring now to Figures 4, S, 6, and 7, an optional pre-molded eiastomeric fitting<br>
1, which adapts an external hose to the internal stress relief profile, is shown.<br>
Referring now to Figure 8, a cross section of an inflatable article 3a in a deflated<br>
condition is shown, illustrating the position of stress relief profile 2 relative to inflatable<br>
article 3a.<br>
Referring now to Figure 9, said inflatable article 3a is shown in the inflated<br>
configuration with the stress relief profile 2 secured to the inside of said inflated article.<br>
As for definitions of certain terms the dock bumper element may merely be the<br>
expandable portion of the dock bumper ; an inflatable seal element may merely be the<br>
expandable portion of the inflatable seal; the inflatable jack element (may be smooth<br>
perimeter or substantially rectangular, e.g.) may merely be the expandable portion of the<br>
inflatable jack.<br>
31<br>
Figure 14 is a cross section of a pneumatic spillway gate in accordance with the<br>
present invention. Relief groove 23 may be provided to connect air fitting 24 to hollow<br>
stress relief extrusion 2. Gate panel 24 may be secured to hinge flap 25 by means of hinge<br>
retainer 26.<br>
It is important to understand that the stress relief insert 1014 may be removable<br>
(such as a removable, deflated bladder fold membrane insert element) as by force or by<br>
dissolution (i.e., a dissolvable, deflated bladder fold membrane insert element) after a<br>
manufacturing process (such as vulcanization) so that it does not remain in the final<br>
inflatable product, but instead is used to positively conform the deflated bladder fold<br>
during the manufacturing process (such as vulcanization), with the intent that such shape<br>
will be retained after manufacture and the minimum curvature radius of the deflated fold<br>
membrane in a deflated configuration will be greater than what it would be without use of<br>
a positively conforming insert, and thus the inflated stresses at the deflated fold membrane<br>
will be less than what they otherwise would be during inflation. Such a positively<br>
conformed inflatable bladder apparatus 1015 may be termed a strength enhanced inflatable<br>
bladder apparatus and may include at least one positively conformed, inflated stress<br>
reduced (or distributed) deflated bladder fold membrane element 1016 that is positively<br>
conformed to have an inflated bladder stress reduction significant increase in a minimum<br>
curvature radius 1017 and where a deflated bladder fold proximate membrane profile (the<br>
profile of the bladder membrane that is near the deflated bladder fold) 1018 exhibits an<br>
approximately thirty degree or greater deflation configuration spatial void profile point<br>
angle 1020. The deflated bladder fold membrane element 1016 that is positively<br>
conformed to have an inflated bladder stress reduction significant increase in a minimum<br>
curvature radius 1017 may be positively conformed using a dissolvable or removable<br>
insert so that the minimum curvature radius 1017 of the deflated bladder fold membrane<br>
1016 is increased to the point where there is a noticeable or functionally significant<br>
increase in the inflation pressure that causes failure at the deflated bladder fold. The<br>
bladder structure is such that an increase in the minimum curvature radius of the deflated<br>
bladder fold membrane may result in an increase in what is termed the deflation<br>
configuration spatial void profile point angle 1020 of the deflated bladder fold proximate<br>
membrane profile 1018, and that the use of a removable or dissolvable stress relief insert<br>
to positively conform the deflated bladder fold membrane may^ cause this point angle 1020<br>
32<br>
to be approximately thirty degrees or greater. Importantly, the strength enhanced<br>
inflatable bladder apparatus may be manufactured during a single stage vulcanization.<br>
Manufacturing processes related to a positively conformed deflated bladder fold may be<br>
termed inflatable bladder failure resistance enhancement methods and may include the<br>
step of dissolvedly removing (or simply removing) a longitudinal relief element, which, in<br>
order to facilitate dissolution, may be a eutectic salt stress relief element or an aluminum<br>
stress relief element, as but two examples. Methods related to the stress relief insert may<br>
be termed inflatable bladder failure resistance enhancement methods, regardless of<br>
whether the stress relief insert is removed or dissolved. Note that the term inflatable water<br>
gate panel actuator element (or inflatable gate panel actuator element) may be used to refer<br>
to an inflatable bladder used to actuate water gate panel(s). A water gate panel actuator<br>
element (or a gate panel actuator element) refers to any type of actuator (pneumatic,<br>
hydraulic, etc.) that actuates water gate panels (which may include overtop trafficable<br>
gates in addition to other water control gates such as spillway gates or canal or weir gates).<br>
Referring now to Figure 10, an inflatable elastomeric dam is shown in the deflated<br>
condition. Inflatable elastomeric dam bladder 3 is secured by an inflatable dam-to-<br>
foundation attachment element (or inflatable membrane-to-foundation attachment<br>
element) that may include a wedge-shaped clamp retention element 1021 (or wedge-<br>
shaped inflatable membrane (or bladder)-to-foundation clamp retention element) that may<br>
consist of parts 1 la, lib, 1 lc, 1 Id, and I le at upstream end 10) or an attachment element<br>
that alternatively may comprise an inflatable membrane-to-foundation clampable retention<br>
element 1022 that may be substantially flat 1022 and an inflatable membrane-to-<br>
foundation clamp retention enhancement element 1023 that may include a comma-type<br>
insert 21. Further, a pressurized fluid inlet element 24 may be added to render the item<br>
activatable. Insert plies 12 may prevent tearing or leaking if the envelope is inflated with<br>
zero or insufficient external clamping force. Fin (or termed differently, inflatable<br>
elastomeric dam overtop flow-deflection fin, or an overflow deflection fin) 14 is any<br>
protrusion that may divert the overtop flow away from the elastomeric dam and may<br>
include a stress relief insert IS that is established co-radially (radius of the inflated<br>
bladder) and internally of reinforcement layer 16. Note that any reinforcement layer (in<br>
any inflatable article) may also be referred to as reinforced bladder ply, or reinforced<br>
layer, e.g., and may include a fibrous or fabric material such as kevlar, nylon, polyester, as<br>
but a few examples, or any type of twisted cord, wire rope, braided rope, knitted fabric, or<br>
33<br>
woven fabric, each of which may be embedded in or covered with an eiastomeric material.<br>
Reinforcement 16 of fin 14 increases the strength and stiffness of fin 14. The fin may be<br>
established such that a minimum bladder fold membrane curvature radius occurs co-<br>
radially and internally of the inflatable eiastomeric dam overtop flow deflection fin<br>
(indeed, it may be termed an overtop flow deflection fin proximate bladder fold<br>
membrane). The inflatable membrane to which the stress relief insert may be attached, or<br>
which may be positively conformed to have an increased minimum curvature radius, may<br>
be termed a flow deflection fin proximate inner bladder section, and may exhibit not only<br>
an approximately thirty degree or greater void profile point angle, but also a substantially<br>
circular arc inner bladder curvature 1024 and a rounded, inwardly pointing curvature<br>
1017. This represents an improvement over those designs that, for example, had such a<br>
sharp fold that the deflated bladder fold appeared to have a bracket (}) shape 102S, with<br>
extreme stress concentrations arising at the right point of the } 1026. Related methods<br>
may be termed inflatable eiastomeric dam failure resistance enhancement methods.<br>
Figure 11 shows the inflatable dam of Figure 10 in the inflated configuration.<br>
Inflatable membrane 3 holds fin 14 and stress relief extrusion 2 in position. Clamp 17<br>
holds the inflatable dam to spillway 18. The interior surface of the bladder membrane 3<br>
may be designed to stay within safe stress and strain limits by virtue of lack of stress<br>
concentrations which might be present were the deflated membrane 3 not shaped to<br>
conform to stress relief insert 2. Recess 18a in foundation or spillway 18 allows the<br>
thickened downstream portion of said inflatable dam including inserts 2 and IS to lie flat<br>
against foundation 18 in the deflated configuration.<br>
Referring now to Figure 12, another embodiment of an inflatable dam, using a<br>
simple rectangular clamp 18 in conjunction with "comma" insert 21 and anti-tear<br>
reinforcement 12 is shown. The thickened portion of the inflatable membrane 3<br>
containing stress relief shape 2 and fin insert IS lies within a recess in the spillway 22.<br>
Nut 20 holds clamp 18 onto anchor bolt 19. The air connection 24 to the inflatable dam<br>
may be connected to hollow extrusion 2 by means of a molded groove 23 that provides a<br>
clearance space for air between the upper and lower portions of deflated membrane 3.<br>
The inflatable dam may be rendered less prone to flow induced vibration damage when<br>
deflated by lowering the internal pressure to below atmospheric pressure by means of a<br>
vacuum system connected to air supply fitting 24. This causes tight adherence of<br>
34<br>
membrane 3 to insert 2, resulting in a stiffer structure at a location known for damage<br>
problems with conventional designs.<br>
Figure 13 is an inflatable dam similar to that shown in Figure 12 in the inflated<br>
configuration. Insert 21 provides positive engagement to clamp bar 18. Step 22 can be<br>
seen on spillway 118. Said step 22 may allow the inflatable dam to be continuously<br>
supported from the underside while a level profile of the upper surface of said inflatable<br>
dam may be maintained.<br>
As to manufacturing processes, the term extrudedly manufacturing indicates using<br>
a type of extrusion manufacturing process, while the term moldedly manufacturing<br>
indicates using a type of mold manufacturing process.<br>
Figure IS shows the deflated air bladder (or deflated inflatable water control<br>
bladder element) of the spillway gate shown in Figure 14. Insert member 21 is located<br>
upstream of flat portion 28. Holes 29 through flat portion 28 permit assembly with the<br>
clamp bar 118 of Figure 14. The enlarged portion 27 of the water gate panel hinge flap (or<br>
gate pane hinge flap element) 25 may prevent the hinge flap from pulling out from under<br>
the hinge retainer 26 of Figure 14. Anti tearing layers 12 (or circumferentially continuous,<br>
integrally adjoined inner bladder layer) may prevent rupture of inflatable actuator bladder<br>
203 under undamped or loosely clamped conditions in that, instead of following the path<br>
of external bladder layers that perhaps loop 1030 to provide support to the attachment<br>
element, anti-tearing layers 12 traverse the abutment joint 1031 between the upper and<br>
lower installed configuration bladder layers that form an extended loop to provide support<br>
for the attachment element 1032. Note that the term inner bladder layer indicates any<br>
layer other than the outermost bladder layer. The circumferentially continuous, integrally<br>
adjoined inner bladder layer may comprise a layer that is continuous (i.e., does not form<br>
an abutment joint 1031 as it continues on to loop around another part) along a<br>
circumference (which need not be circular) located within a plane that is parallel to a<br>
bladder expansion axis (the axis of primary expansion and usually vertical as installed)<br>
and whose normal vector is substantially perpendicular to a retained water horizontal force<br>
component (the overflow direction). The anti-tearing layers may be an innermost<br>
reinforced bladder ply 1033 and/or may be at least one overflow orthogonal (or upstream<br>
or downstream), deflated bladder joint traversing ply 1034 (perhaps at least one<br>
35<br>
reinforcement ply, and/or perhaps an overflow orthogonal deflated bladder joint traversing<br>
ply, meaning upstream or downstream). The integrally adjoined inner bladder layer may<br>
have longitudinal central axis in an installed configuration (i.e., an installed inflated<br>
configuration longitudinal central axis) 103S that is horizontal and normal to an impending<br>
flow direction. The water control bladder element may be adapted for attachment to a<br>
water control gate panel bottom edge as installed, which merely means that the water<br>
control bladder element can be attached to a water control gate panel edge (that, in an<br>
installed configuration, is the bottom edge). Gate panel actuator-to-foundation attachment<br>
element 1032 (or inflatable membrane-to-foundation attachment element, or inflatable<br>
bladder-to-foundation attachment element) is shown in figure IS as having a gate panel<br>
actuator-to-foundation clampable retention element (or perhaps inflatable bladder-to-<br>
foundation clampable retention element) 1022, which may be a flat clampable section as<br>
shown in Figure 1S, and a gate panel actuator-to-foundation clamp retention enhancement<br>
element (or perhaps inflatable bladder-to-foundation clamp retention enhancement<br>
element) 1023, which may be a comma-type clamp retention enhancement element 21 in<br>
at least one embodiment, but the gate panel actuator-to-foundation attachment element<br>
1032 may also be a wedge-shaped gate panel-to-actuator clamp retention element (or<br>
wedge-shaped bladder-to-foundation clamp retention element) 1021 as shown in Figure<br>
10. As its name suggests, the gate panel actuator-to-foundation attachment element serves<br>
to attach the entire water gate panel actuator apparatus to a foundation such as a spillway<br>
(103S of Figure 92) or roadway foundation, or watercourse foundation, or floodpath<br>
foundation, as but a few examples. The gate pane actuator apparatus may further<br>
comprise a pressurized fluid inlet element. Together with at least one water gate panel,<br>
and perhaps an excessive water gate panel rotation prevention element, the inflatable water<br>
gate panel actuator apparatus (which may be bottom hinged) comprises an inflatably<br>
actuated water gate panel system.<br>
Inflatable article strength enhancement methods are also considered within the<br>
ambit of the inventive technology. One such method may comprise the step of<br>
establishing at least one reinforced expandable inner layer (a flexible fiber reinforced<br>
elastomeric layer, e.g) 1036 to have a continuously adjoined vertically planar perimeter<br>
(another manner of describing the integrally adjoined inner bladder layer) 1033;<br>
establishing an inflatable article end section (that may form the end of the longitudinal<br>
bladder section); establishing only a portion of at least one reinforced expandable outer<br>
36<br>
layer 1037 (where outer layer is defined as all layers other than the innermost layer)<br>
externally of and in direct contact with the reinforced expandable inner layer 1036;<br>
establishing a pressurized fluid inlet element 24 to create a fluid travel port 1038 through<br>
the at least one reinforced expandable inner layer 1036 and the portion of the at least one<br>
reinforced expandable outer layer 1037; diverging a remaining portion of the at least one<br>
reinforced expandable outer layer 1039 from the at least one reinforced expandable inner<br>
layer 1036 along a layer divergence line 1039 (which comports with the above mentioned<br>
abutment joint); and establishing an inflatable bladder-to-foundation attachment element<br>
1040 with at least the remaining portion of the at least one reinforced expandable outer<br>
layer 1041.<br>
The stress relief insert 2 may be used with or without an air supply hole through<br>
the center. The portions of the inflatable envelope which must separate from stress relief<br>
insert 2 during inflation may be prevented from bonding during vulcanization by such<br>
means as water soluble paper, silicone coated nylon release film or fabric, or by omission<br>
of bonding agent, for example.<br>
Referring to Figure B3, stress relief insert 2 containing hole S is bonded at location<br>
8 to release ply 206 which is in turn bonded to inner liner 210. Bonded to inner liner 207<br>
are reinforced plies 208 and 209, followed by outer cover 210. The stress relief insert 2<br>
remains un-bonded except in region 8.<br>
Referring to Figure B4, the cross section of Figure B3 is shown in the inflated<br>
configuration.<br>
Referring now to Figure B6, depicting a deflated air bladder of the spillway gate<br>
shown in Figure B7, insert member 21 is located upstream of flat portion 28. Holes 29<br>
through flat portion 28 permit assembly with the clamp bar 118 of Figure B7. The<br>
enlarged portion 27 of the hinge flap (or water gate-to-inflatable water gate actuator<br>
attachment element) 25 prevents the hinge flap from pulling out from under the hinge<br>
retainer 26 of B7. Holes S through extruded shapes 2, 21, and 27 accommodate locating<br>
wires used to position said extruded shapes during the assembly phase of the<br>
manufacturing process.<br>
37<br>
Referring now to Figure B7, a cross section of a pneumatic spillway gate system is<br>
-depicted, mounted to a dam spillway 18, utilizing an inflatable actuator bladder 203<br>
manufactured in accordance with the present invention. Relief groove 23 connects air<br>
fitting 24 to hollow stress relief extrusion 2. Gate panel 24 is secured to hinge flap 25 by<br>
means of hinge retainer 26. The inflatable actuator bladder 203 is clamped to the dam<br>
spillway 30 by clamp bar 118.<br>
Referring to Figure B8, section A-A of Figure B7, air supply groove 23 is molded<br>
into interior surface 119 of the inflatable article membrane 3.<br>
Figure 16 shows an air supply groove 23 molded into inflatable membrane 3 at<br>
section A-A of Figure 14.<br>
Referring to Figures 60a, 60b, 60c, and 60d, a cross section of an air bladder in<br>
accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is shown. Clamped portion 861<br>
may be fixed to a dam spillway with a simple rectangular steel clamp bar, for example.<br>
The vertical face 86S of air bladder 8S3 may be molded to conform tightly to said clamp<br>
bar throughout the range of motion of hinge flap 862. In this manner the trapping of sand<br>
and gravel between said clamp bar and hinge flap 862 may be avoided thus prolonging the<br>
life of said air bladder 8S3. Inflatable cavity 866 may extend upstream to approximately<br>
position 866a. Reinforcement may preferably be oriented at approximately 54 degrees and<br>
44 minutes from the axis of the air bladder. With said cord angle there is no significant<br>
tendency for said air bladder to either elongate or contract during pressurization. Said<br>
reinforcing cord plies are preferably used in pairs of one left hand and one right hand. The<br>
inflatable portion of said air bladder preferably has continuous reinforcement, including<br>
sufficient overlap at any splices, at approximately the aforementioned angles in both the<br>
right hand and left hand orientations around the full circumference of said air bladder. In<br>
the configuration depicted, a total of three plies of said reinforcement act together to meet<br>
this requirement. Ply 807 serves to reinforce said air bladder in a first direction. Ply 807<br>
simply encircles inflatable cavity 866 and overlaps itself to form a spliced tubular shape.<br>
Ply 808 serves to reinforce said air bladder in a second direction. The upper and lower<br>
portions of ply 808 may also extend across clamped portion 861, hence around upstream<br>
insert 821, hence back downstream across flat clamped portion 861, hence across hinge<br>
flap 862, hence around hinge flap insert 827, hence back upstream across hinge flap 862.<br>
38<br>
hence further upstream across clamped portion 861, terminating near insert 21. Plies 807<br>
and 808 together provide for continuous reinforcement around inflatable cavity 866 except<br>
for a discontinuity where ply 808 extends upstream under clamped portion 861. Said plies<br>
807 and 808 might sufficiently reinforce inflatable cavity 866 when clamped portion 61 is<br>
tightly clamped. In order to provide sufficient reinforcing during undamped or loosely<br>
clamped conditions, ply 860 may be added to provide continuous reinforcement in the<br>
same ply direction as ply 808 at the upstream end of inflatable cavity 866. In this manner<br>
said air bladder may be safely inflated without being clamped and may not be subject to<br>
premature failure due to being loosely clamped to a dam spillway.<br>
Figure 17 and Figure 18 show an inflatable hose in accordance with the present<br>
invention. Stress relief insert 2 may be used to facilitate manufacture of said hose and<br>
may be used to prevent complete collapse of said hose under high external pressure<br>
conditions such as during deep sea immersion. Said complete collapse may impart<br>
damaging stress to a flat hose of prior art lacking stress relief insert 2. Note that the term<br>
inflatable hose is defined to include not only expansion hoses (whose inflatable character<br>
allows them to serve as mechanical pressure imparting apparatus), but also fluid<br>
conveyance hoses, whose primary function is to convey fluid and as to whom inflation<br>
may be merely incidental, but nonetheless does occur (albeit usually not to the extent of,<br>
e.g., expansion hoses) and justifies their inclusion as among the group of inflatable hoses.<br>
Both types of hoses, and all inflatable articles for that matter, can be termed as<br>
pressurizable articles.<br>
The fluid conveyance hose 1010 includes as a part a fluid conveyance element<br>
1042 that serves to directionally and pressurizedly convey the pressurized fluid, a<br>
pressurized fluid inlet element; and a discrete (meaning different from the inlet element at<br>
a given point in time) pressurized fluid outlet element that allows exit of the conveyed<br>
pressurized fluid. The expansion hose (or inflation hose) may comprise an expansion hose<br>
element 1042 (that, when sufficiently pressurized, expands the hose to impart external<br>
pressure or outer inflatable membrane displacement) and a pressurized fluid inlet element<br>
that may also serve as a pressurized fluid outlet element.<br>
Another aspect of the inventive technology is an integral water gate panel hinge<br>
flap 10S0 (of the inflatable water gate panel actuator apparatus) that is configured to<br>
39<br>
conform tightly to an abutting face 10S1 of the inflatable bladder-to-foundation clamp 118<br>
(clamps the clampable retention element 1022 of the inflatable bladder-to-foundation<br>
attachment element 1040). Preliminarily, the integral water gate hinge flap is a flap that is<br>
integral with the water gate panel actuator apparatus and that serves as an attachment<br>
element for the gate panel to the water gate panel actuator apparatus; it may be termed an<br>
integral water gate panel hinge flap attachment element. Essentially, the integral water<br>
gate panel hinge flap 10S0 may comprise an overflow orthogonal, vertical, inflatable<br>
bladder-to-foundation clamp face abutting, corner-augmented edge element 10S2 which is<br>
a edge element that is augmented to have a corner 1053 that abuts an overflow orthogonal<br>
(e.g., downstream) vertical face I0S1 of an inflatable bladder-to-foundation clamp 118.<br>
This edge element may be configured to abut substantially all proximate portions of the<br>
overflow orthogonal, vertical inflatable bladder-to-foundation clamp face 1051. An<br>
associated method may comprise the step of corner-augmenting an upper edge of the<br>
integral water gate panel hinge flap attachment element 1050 to conform to an overflow<br>
orthogonal, vertical, inflatable bladder-to-foundation clamp face 1051.<br>
An inflatable article manufacturing method may comprise the steps of establishing<br>
a bend resistant deflated bladder fold creation facilitation element 201 (which serves as a<br>
firm support around which to bend an elastomeric material layer in order to create a<br>
deflated bladder fold) responsive to an inflatable bladder manufacture frame 211; folding<br>
at least a portion of at least one elastomeric layer 207 around the bend resistant deflated<br>
bladder fold creation facilitation element 201 to create at least one inner-most bladder<br>
layer 207 (contact between the facilitation element and the layer is not required); creating<br>
an oppositely facing inner most layer 1060 ; preventing adjoining of the oppositely facing<br>
inner-most bladder layer 1060 (as by insertion between the innermost layers of a cotton or<br>
other non-adherable sheet 206, as but one example, so that the inflow of pressurized fluid<br>
has a cavity to expand); and removing the bend resistant deflated bladder fold creation<br>
facilitation element 201 from at least one created elastomeric fold. Note that the term<br>
bend resistant indicates a resistance to bending that might occur orthogonally to the length<br>
of the bend resistant deflated bladder fold creation facilitation element (as might be caused<br>
by the pressure of the manufacturing process (perhaps a manual process) that may seek to<br>
tightly bend the elastomeric layer around the bend resistant deflated bladder fold creation<br>
facilitation element). To be bend resistant, as defined, the bend resistant deflated bladder<br>
fold creation facilitation element need not be able to resist all deflection or displacement<br>
40<br>
associated with bending, but rather only that amount which impairs the integrity and shape<br>
of the finished bladder product.<br>
The bend resistant deflated bladder fold creation facilitation element may be a<br>
substantially straight, bend resistant deflated bladder fold creation facilitation element 201;<br>
it may be a tensionable wire (or cable), bend resistant deflated bladder fold creation<br>
facilitation element 201; it may be a tensionable rod, bend resistant deflated bladder fold<br>
creation facilitation element 1061; it may be a metal bend resistant deflated bladder fold<br>
creation facilitation element 201. The step of tensioning a bend resistant deflated bladder<br>
fold creation facilitation element may include the step of tensioning the deflated bladder<br>
fold creation facilitation element either manually or automatically. The tensioning may<br>
also be accomplished hydraulically (either automatically or not), either alone or in addition<br>
to another mode of tension creation. The step of establishing at least two bend resistant<br>
deflated bladder fold creation facilitators may comprise the step of establishing at least<br>
two parallel bend resistant deflated bladder fold creation facilitators 1062, which step itself<br>
may comprise the steps of establishing a substantially elongated, substantially cross-<br>
sectionally drop-shaped, deflated bladder fold membrane insert element 2 around at least<br>
one of the at least two parallel, bend resistant deflated bladder fold creation facilitation<br>
elements 1062; and establishing a bladder-to-foundation clamp retention enhancement<br>
insert 1023 (which is any insert that serves to enhance the clamp retention of the bladder<br>
to the foundation) around a different at least one of the at least two parallel bend resistant<br>
deflated bladder fold creation facilitators 1062. This method may further comprise the<br>
step of establishing a panel-to-panel actuator element clamp retention enhancement insert<br>
1065 (which is any insert that serves to enhance the clamp retention of a water gate panel<br>
to its actuator element, which may be inflatable) around a different at least one of said at<br>
least two parallel bend resistant deflated bladder fold creation facilitators 1062. The step<br>
of establishing at least two parallel bend resistant deflated bladder fold creation facilitators<br>
1062 may comprise the step of establishing at least four rectangularly arranged bend<br>
resistant deflated bladder fold creation facilitators 1067 (note that this step does not<br>
preclude an addition of steps that create more parallel (or other oriented) bend resistant<br>
deflated bladder fold creation facilitators). The general method may further comprise the<br>
step of establishing a substantially elongated, substantially cross-sectionally drop-shaped,<br>
deflated bladder fold membrane insert element 2 around at least a portion of the bend<br>
resistant deflated bladder fold creation facilitation element, which step may be performed<br>
41<br>
before the step of folding at least a portion of at least one elastomeric layer 207 around the<br>
bend resistant deflated bladder fold creation facilitation element 201. The general method<br>
may further comprise the step of establishing a clamp retention facilitation insert element<br>
1068 (which is any insert that serves to enhance the clamp retention or any element by<br>
providing some sort of obstruction that counteracts forces that the clamped part may be<br>
subjected to) around at least a portion of the bend resistant deflated bladder fold creation<br>
facilitation element 201. This step may be performed before the step of folding at least a<br>
portion of at least one elastomeric layer 207 around the bend resistant deflated bladder<br>
fold creation facilitation element 201.<br>
Referring to Figure Bl, rigid frame 211 positions wires 201, which are tensioned<br>
by tightening element 204. A release ply 206, which bonds to an inner liner 207, is shown<br>
secured to wires 201. An opening 212 is left in each of the four corners of release ply 206<br>
to allow the inner liner 207 to bond to itself and form a seal at each corner of the inflatable<br>
article. First reinforcement ply 8 is later wrapped around inner liner 207, followed by<br>
second reinforcement ply 209, followed by outer cover 210.<br>
Referring now to Figure B2 stress relief inserts 2 are positioned on wires 201.<br>
Inflatable membrane 3 is wrapped tightly around stress relief inserts 2.<br>
Referring now to Figure BS, wires 201 position release ply 206 which in turn<br>
defines a rectangular box shape to which subsequent plies may be added. Note that the<br>
release ply 206 does not extend into corner areas 212 so that said corner areas 212 may<br>
bond closed and provide a permanent seal during the vulcanization process.<br>
Referring to Figure B9, edge defining wires 212 may be attached to edge defining<br>
wires 201 and may be configured to limit the deflection of edge defining wires I.<br>
Referring to Figure BIO, support frame 211 positions wires 201 secured by<br>
tightening means 204. The set 229 of three parallel wires 201 provide for locating an<br>
auxiliary feature such as the hinge flap insert 27 depicted in Figure B6.<br>
Referring to Figure B11, a single wire rope 228 may be used to provide location<br>
control of all four edges of inflatable article 218. Tightening means (or, perhaps even,<br>
42<br>
tension element) 304, such as an air cylinder, in combination with fixed attachments 214<br>
may be used to keep the wire rope 228 tensioned. Rings 223 may be used to connect the<br>
adjacent runs of wire rope 228 at the comers 226 of the inflatable article 218.<br>
Referring to Figure B12, inflatable article 218 is positioned within mold 314.<br>
Grooves 315 in mold 314 may be used to help keep stress relief insert 2 in position in<br>
mold after positioning wires 201 (in other figures) are withdrawn from holes 5.<br>
Alternatively, a groove similar to groove 315 may be provided on only one side of such a<br>
mold. Alternatively a flat tool in more or less continuous contact with the flat surface of<br>
inflatable article 318 with a beveled edge may be used.<br>
Referring to Figure B13, bias ply reinforcement layer 222 is shown in position<br>
relative to wires 201 before said reinforcement layer 222 is folded around said wires 201.<br>
Referring to Figure B14, air fitting 216, such as a standard double ended barbed<br>
hose nipple, may be located on tube 217 which is in turn located on wire 201. This may<br>
be used to secure the air fitting 216 in its correct position relative to inflatable article 318.<br>
A water impoundment apparatus that may accommodate overtop traffic may<br>
comprise an inflatable water impoundment element actuator element 2000 (e.g. an<br>
inflatable actuator); an inflatable actuator-to-foundation attachment element 1032 to which<br>
the inflatable water impoundment element actuator element is responsive and that<br>
comprises a cross-sectionally-enlarged, inflatable actuator-to-foundation clamp retention<br>
improvement element 2001 (which may be a wedge-shaped inflatable actuator-to-<br>
foundation clamp retention element 1021 or include a circular cross-sectional shaped (such<br>
as a comma-type), inflatable actuator-to-foundation clamp retention enhancement element<br>
insert 21, as but a few examples); an overtop trafficable water impoundment element 401<br>
(such as a water control gate that when lowered can support overhead traffic of at least one<br>
of a variety of types) responsive to the inflatable water impoundment element actuator<br>
element 2000; a flexible fiber reinforced hinge element (which may be an S-type flexible<br>
hinge 2002, an integrated figure eight flexible hinge 2003, a modular figure eight flexible<br>
hinge 2004, a W-type flexible hinge 2005, and a compression hinge 2006) to which the<br>
overtop trafficable water impoundment element is responsive; a hinge-to-impoundment<br>
element attachment element 2007 (which is any element that serves to enable attachment<br>
43<br>
of the flexible fiber reinforced hinge to the impoundment element) responsive to the<br>
flexible fiber reinforced hinge element; and a hinge-to-foundation attachment element<br>
2008 (which is any element that serves to attach the opposite side of the hinge to the<br>
foundation, which may be an abutting roadway, walkway, railway track support, as but a<br>
few examples) to which the flexible fiber reinforced hinge element is responsive, wherein<br>
an axis of rotation of the overtop trafficable water impoundment element 401 (which may<br>
precisely coincide with that of the hinge) is substantially at an overtop trafficable water<br>
impoundment element end 2011, and wherein the overtop trafficable water impoundment<br>
element 401 has a flush upper trafficable surface 2012 (meaning that the overtop<br>
trafficable water impoundment element is not only flush along its trafflced length, but also<br>
that its traffic direction orthogonal ends 2013 are flush with the proximate non-<br>
impoundment structure surfaces). Note that the attachment element may include a clamp.<br>
Flush need not mean entirely without gaps, ridges and/or valleys, but merely that those<br>
that may exist are not substantial enough to impair or render unsafe the passage of traffic<br>
along that surface. The apparatus may further comprise an elastomeric hinge cover which<br>
may substantially surround at least the upper half of the hinge (such as the integrated<br>
figure eight flexible hinge). The flexible fiber of the flexible fiber reinforced hinge<br>
element may be a flexible fiber selected from the group of flexible fibers consisting of<br>
twisted cord, wire rope, braided rope, knitted fabric, woven fabric, twisted cord embedded<br>

embedded by or layered with an elastomer, as but a few examples. The apparatus may<br>
further comprise a surface hinge cover 422 that is pivotally responsive to the overtop<br>
trafficable water impoundment element and that may serve to provide a flush surface<br>
above the hinge and that may pivot in order to not obstruct rotation of the impoundment<br>
element 401. The overtop trafficable water impoundment element 401 may be an overtop<br>
vehicularly trafficable water impoundment element 20IS (meaning that it can support<br>
vehicular traffic), an overtop pedestrian trafficable water impoundment element (meaning<br>
that it can support pedestrian traffic), and an overtop railway trafficable water<br>
impoundment element 2016 (meaning that it can support railroad traffic). The inflatable<br>
water impoundment element actuator element 2000 may be a downflow-side positioned or<br>
44<br>
an impounded water-side (or upflow) positioned 2018 (with respect to the impoundment<br>
element) inflatable water impoundment element actuator element (see Fig. 101). Further,<br>
an excessive impoundment element rotation prevention element, or raised water<br>
impoundment element position maintenance element 421 (which acts to prevent undesired<br>
excessive rotation of impoundment element) may be at least one stationary excessive<br>
rotation obstruction stop (as shown in Figure 102a). which may be any impoundment<br>
element rotation obstructing part, perhaps located on foundation parts (such as an<br>
abutments) adjacent the impoundment structure in a raised position. In the configuration<br>
where the inflatable water impoundment element actuator element is an impounded water-<br>
side positioned inflatable water impoundment element actuator element (see Figure 101),<br>
the overtop trafficable water impoundment may be a floatable overtop trafficable water<br>
impoundment element, or the apparatus may further comprise a floatable water<br>
impoundment element actuator element to which the overtop trafficable water<br>
impoundment element is floatably responsive (meaning the buoyancy of the floatable<br>
actuator element causes the water impoundment element to raise. This floatable water<br>
impoundment element actuator element may be established substantially beneath the<br>
overtop trafficable water impoundment element and/or it may form a part of the overtop<br>
trafficable water impoundment element.<br>
Another water impoundment element apparatus may comprise a floatably raisable<br>
overtop trafficable water impoundment element (see Fig. 103) (which, e.g., is a water<br>
impoundment element such as a gate that can support overhead traffic in a lowered<br>
configuration and which can be raised by a floatable element); a flexible fiber reinforced<br>
hinge element to which the floatably raisable, overtop trafficable water impoundment<br>
element is responsive; a hinge-to-impoundment element attachment element 2007<br>
responsive to the flexible fiber reinforced hinge element; a float element 2009 (which may<br>
form a part of overtop trafficable water impoundment element or which may be located<br>
externally of the overtop trafficable water impoundment element) and a hinge-to-<br>
foundation attachment element 2008 to which the flexible fiber reinforced hinge element<br>
is responsive, wherein the floatably raisable, overtop trafficable water impoundment<br>
element has a flush upper surface. The axis of rotation of the floatably raisable overtop<br>
trafficable water impoundment element (which may coincide precisely with that of the<br>
hinge) may be substantially at a water impoundment element end 2010. Further, the<br>
floatably raisable, overtop trafficable water impoundment element may be a floatably<br>
45<br>
raisable, overtop vehicularly trafficable water impoundment element, a floatably raisable,<br>
overtop pedestrian trafficable water impoundment element, and/or a floatably raisable,<br>
overtop railway trafficable water impoundment element. The hinge-to-impoundment<br>
element attachment element 2007 may comprise a cross-sectionally enlarged clamp<br>
retention improvement element 2001 (which may be a wedge-shaped clamp retention<br>
element 1021 or include a circular cross-sectional shaped 21, such as a comma-type clamp<br>
retention enhancement element insert 21, as but a few examples). Similarly, the hinge-to-<br>
foundation attachment element 208 may comprise a cross-sectionally enlarged clamp<br>
retention improvement element 2001. The flat element may form a part of the overtop<br>
trafficable water impoundment element or it may be located externally to it.<br>
Another water impoundment apparatus, one which may be particularly adapted for<br>
protection from sea-surge flooding, may comprise an inflatable water impoundment<br>
element actuator element (see Fig. 102); an inflatable actuator-to-foundation attachment<br>

the inflatable water impoundment element actuator element 2000; a flexible Tiber<br>
reinforced hinge element to which the water impoundment element 2021 is responsive; a<br>
hinge-to-impoundment element attachment element 2007 responsive to the flexible fiber<br>
reinforced hinge element and a hinge-to-foundation attachment element 2008 to which the<br>
flexible fiber reinforced hinge element 202S is responsive, wherein an axis of rotation of<br>
the water impoundment element (which may coincide precisely with an axis of rotation of<br>
the hinge) is substantially at a water impoundment element end. The inflatable water<br>
impoundment element actuator element may be a seaward positioned inflatable water<br>
impoundment element actuator element, or a river-ward positioned inflatable water<br>
impoundment element actuator element.<br>
It is important to note that the overtop trafficable gate can be made of numerous<br>
and various composite materials such as fiberglass, trusses, resins, and/or concrete with<br>
composite resin, as but a few examples, in order to reduce weight and road salt effects and<br>
to improve strength, e.g.<br>
Referring now to Figure Cl, gate panel 401 may be fixed by hinge means 48 to a<br>
fixed frame 406 which may be embedded in roadway 407. Actuator element such as air<br>
bladder 403 may support gate panel 401 in the raised position against the pressure of water<br>
49.<br>
Referring now to Figure C2 a detailed cross section is shown, in the gate-lowered<br>
position, of the hinge shown in the gate assembly of Figure CI. Gate panel 401 may<br>
incorporate slots 402 through which cord 45 may pass in a "figure 8" pattern, thereby<br>
connecting the gate panel 401 to a fixed element 49. Fixed element 49 may have rounded<br>
edges so as to not cut cord 45 and may be fixed to embedded frame 406 by mounting bolts<br>
416.<br>
Referring now to Figure C3, gate panel 401 is filled with concrete 415 and is<br>
shown in its lowered position. The outer perimeter of the gate panel 401 may be defined<br>
by frame members 413 and 414 as well, as corresponding similar members on the ends of<br>
the gate panel not shown. Fixed hinge element 409 may be connected to movable hinge<br>
element 412 by flexible cords identified in Figure C6.<br>
Referring now to Figure C4, gate panel 401 is shown in its raised position. Low<br>
friction surface 427 is shown secured to the concrete by anchor assemblies 450. Anchor<br>
bolt 416 may secure clamp bar 417, which may in turn secure air bladder 333 by its<br>
enlarged end 418.<br>
Referring now to Figures and C5 and C6, Figure C5 shows a plan view of a gate<br>
assembly hinge; fig C6 shows an edge on side view of a gate assemly hinge. Fixed<br>
structural member 409 may be connected to movable structural member 442 by means of<br>
flexible tensile member 445 which may pass through rounded edge slots 402 in structural<br>
members 409 and 442. Upper elastomeric cover 412 may be bonded to structural members<br>
409 and 442 as well as flexible tensile member 445. Flexible tensile member 445 may<br>
also be bonded to structural members 409 and 442 except where rolling contact may occur<br>
between structural members 409 and 442.<br>
Referring now to Figure C7, flexible tensile member 445 may be wrapped around<br>
tubular members 438 and bonded thereto in the region without rolling action 440 but not<br>
47<br>
bonded to the tubular members 438 in the region of rolling contact 441. Tubular members<br>
438 may be connected to structural members 439 which may in turn be part of or attach to<br>
the remainder of the hinged and fixed structures.<br>
Referring now to Figures C8 and C9, showing a cross section of a gate assembly in<br>
the raised and lowered positions respectively, a gate panel 401 is shown filled with<br>
concrete 415 and attached to foundation 426 by anchor bolts 416 holding clamps 437<br>
which may in turn hold hinge flap 436, to which gate panel 401 may be connected.<br>
Hinged cover 422 in combination with filler material 423 may be used to provide a smooth<br>
surface flush with roadway 407 and gate panel 401.<br>
Referring now to Figure CIO and CU, railroad rails 429 are fixed to gate panel<br>
401. Rail segment 430 is pivotably mounted to the foundation by bracket 43S. Gate panel<br>
401 is supported against rail loads by deflated air bladder 403 and bearing pads 42S.<br>
Restraining chain 421 limits the movement of gate panel 401.<br>
Referring to Figures C12 and C13, gate panel 401 is shown in its raised position<br>
supported by air bladder 3 and restrained by restraining means 421.<br>
Referring to Figure C14, gate panel 401, in its raised position, is supported by air<br>
bladder 333 and attached to embedded frame 406 by hinge 448. Frame 406 is embedded<br>
flush with roadway 407.<br>
Referring now to Figures Dl, D2, D3, D4, DS, and D7, gate panel 401 may be<br>
supported by air bladder 333 against side seal 56. Fixed hinge element 61 may retain<br>
enlarged edge of air bladder 333 in groove comprising frame S06, groove element SI and<br>
screed 52. Fixed hinge element 61 may be secured to embedded frame S06 by fastening<br>
means SS. Seal 56 may be secured to wall 59 by retainer 57 which may in turn be secured<br>
by fasteners 58. Connection block-out 54 may be an integral part of the embedded frame<br>
shown in Figure D5. The embedded frame 506 of Figure D5 may comprise upper edge<br>
560, frame elements 506, frame element 51, screed 52, and air connection block-out 54.<br>
Referring to Figure D6, an alternate design of enlarged air bladder edge is show in cross-<br>
section. Wedges 62 may retain reinforcement layers 63 of air bladder 333.<br>
48<br>
Referring now to Figure 87a (gate raised) and 87b (gate lowered), a drive-over<br>
flood control gate in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention is<br>
shown. Gate panel 914 may be actuated by air bladder 333. When the gate 914 is in the<br>
lowered position, it may transmit traffic loads through air bladder 333 to foundation<br>
portion 426. Shims, cut from rubber sheet for example, may be used to facilitate uniform<br>
load transfer. In this manner, vibration and noise levels may be minimized while gate cost<br>
and weight may be kept at reasonable levels. Hinge element 90 may preferably be<br>
manufactured from reinforced rubber materials. Hinge element clamping portions 92, 91,<br>
an 914a may preferably be shaped to place the hinge pivot axis as high as possible to<br>
minimize tensile stresses in hinge element 90 while providing a flat upper surface which<br>
may be safe for pedestrian and vehicular traffic with the gate panel 914 lowered. Seal<br>
element 92 may be used to seal the periphery of gate panel 914, thereby minimizing the<br>
intrusion of dirt, sand, water, road salt, etc. which might shorten the life or reduce the<br>
reliability of the system.<br>
An impounded water control system that involves a movable actuator may<br>
comprise a plurality of water gate elements (such as water gate panels) 614a, 614b, 614c; a<br>
translatable, water gate actuator element 612 repositionably locatable substantially beneath<br>
the plurality of water gate elements; a reposition element (which can be used to relocate<br>
the water gate actuator element under different water gate elements) 608 to which the<br>
translatable, water gate actuator element 612 is operationally responsive; and a plurality of<br>
support elements 7 (which may serve to maintain a raised water gate in a raised position,<br>
thus allowing the translatable, water gate actuator element 612 to be relocated beneath<br>
another water gate element in order to raise it), each to which at least one individual gate<br>
element of the plurality of water gate elements is responsive. The translatable water gate<br>
actuator element 612 may comprise two vertically stacked water gate actuator elements<br>
(which may be inflatable) in at least one embodiment. The reposition element 608 may<br>
comprise a water gate actuator reposition hose assembly 608 or any other type of system,<br>
perhaps including a guide or track for the translatable water gate actuator element, that can<br>
be operated to move the translatable water gate actuator element as desired. The plurality<br>
of support elements may comprise at least one strut element, which may comprise an<br>
upper strut member and a lower strut member pivotally responsive to the upper strut<br>
member by a horizontally longitudinal torque tube adjoining at least two adjacent strut<br>
elements.<br>
49<br>
Referring now to Figure El a, gate panel 14a is fixed by hinge means 601 to a<br>
spillway 60S and is depicted in its lowered position, which position is required for the<br>
efficient passage of flood flows. Gate panel 614b is depicted in its raised position in<br>
association with an air bladder actuator 612 comprising upper chamber 612a and lower<br>
chamber 612b. Gate panels 614c and 6l4d are depicted in their raised positions where<br>
they are kept raised by struts 607. The actuator 612 is able to be positioned under any gate<br>
panel by means of hose assembly 608. Hose assembly 608 serves as a positioning cable<br>
which passes around pulleys 608b, 608c, 608d, 608e, and 608f. Pulley 608f is connected<br>
to a drive mechanism 608f. Access pit 609 within abutment or pier 611 allows for repair<br>
or replacement of actuator 612 away from flows over spillway 605. Although the<br>
preferred actuating means is a dual chambered air bladder 612 as shown in Figure El,<br>
alternative lifting devices such as screw jacks or hydraulic cylinders may be used, if they<br>
are configured to be of sufficiently low profile to fit under the lowered gate panels.<br>
Referring now to Figure E2, a detail of the same arrangement of equipment as<br>
Figure El is depicted.<br>
Referring now to Figure E3, gate panel 614 can be seen to be supported by strut<br>
607., which strut support means is conventional and is by itself not part of this invention.<br>
The air bladder 612 comprising chambers 612a and 612b may be fixed from moving<br>
downstream by embed 604, while gate panel 614 may be fixed to the spillway 60S by<br>
hinge means 601. Positioning hose 608, which could also be wire rope, or combination of<br>
wire rope and hose, may move through conduit 608a in a direction opposite to the<br>
movement of the actuating means such as air bladder 612.<br>
Referring now to Figure E4, depicts the same arrangement of equipment as Figure<br>
E3, but with the gate panel 614 in the lowered position.<br>
Referring now to Figure ES, another embodiment of the present invention is shown<br>
wherein gate panel 614e is held in its raised position by strut means comprised of elements<br>
607d, 607g, and 607f.<br>
Referring now to Figure ESa, the embodiment of Figure ES is shown with an<br>
actuating air bladder 612 in its inflated configuration.<br>
Referring now to Figure E6, gate panel 614e, of Figure E5, is shown in its lowered<br>
position where its top surface is flush with the top edges of foundation 605a. This flush<br>
surface can provide a roadway, walkway, or railroad bed surface which may render this<br>
configuration eminently suitable for use as a floodwater barrier in lieu of permanent<br>
immovable concrete flood walls or earthen levees. The strut means depicted comprises<br>
upper elements 607d coordinated by torque tube 607g and pivotably connected to lower<br>
elements 607f. Although two support points are shown for gate panels 614f, 6l4g and<br>
614h, lesser or greater numbers of support points may be used as economics and<br>
engineering considerations dictate.<br>
Referring now to Figure E6a, the embodiment of Figure E6 is shown with air<br>
bladder 612 in its deflated configuration.<br>
Referring now to Figures E7a and E7b, the embodiment of Figures ES, ESa, E6,<br>
and E6a is again shown from downstream (the flood protected side) and upstream (the<br>
flooded side) respectively. Gate panel 614f is shown lowered. Gate panel 6l4g is shown<br>
raised with an actuating air bladder 612 beneath. Gate panels 14h and 14i are shown<br>
raised and supported by strut assemblies 607. The folding of upper strut members 607d<br>
relative to lower strut members 607f may be coordinated by torque tube 607g.<br>
Another water control apparatus may involve concrete gate panels and may<br>
comprise a concrete water control gate panel body element 3000; a slide friction reduced<br>
actuator-side water control gate panel surface element 3001 (a smoothed concrete surface<br>
or a polyethylene surface, e.g., to reduce sliding friction with an actuator such as, e.g., a<br>
water gate panel actuator bladder) responsive to said concrete water control gate panel<br>
body element; and a horizontal axis rotation hinge-to-water gate panel attachment element<br>
3002 (that allows attachment of the concrete gate panel to a horizontal axis rotation hinge)<br>
fixedly positioned at an overflow orthogonal installed water gate panel bottom edge 3003<br>
and to which said concrete water control gate panel body element is responsive. The slide<br>
friction reduced actuator-side water control gate panel surface element may be a<br>
downstream installed water control gate panel surface element 3004. The apparatus may<br>
51<br>
further comprise an elastomeric horizontal axis rotation hinge element. The horizontal<br>
axis rotation hinge-to-water gate panel attachment element may comprise a concrete water<br>
control gate panel body encased attachment element. The concrete water control gate<br>
panel body element may be a fiber or rebar or post-tensioned rod reinforced concrete<br>
water control gate panel body element. An associated method may involve the step of<br>
creating a concrete water control gate panel body element 3000. establishing a slide<br>
friction reduced, actuator-side water control gate panel surface element 3001: and<br>
establishing a horizontal axis rotation hinge-to-water gate panel attachment element 3002,<br>
each of which may be performed at a concrete water gate panel installation site (thus<br>
obviating transportion of a heavy, bulky item).<br>
The generally preferred material for the gate panels 14 may be reinforced concrete,<br>
however, steel, fiberglass, or other construction may be preferred for certain projects. The<br>
use of reinforced concrete may allow for simple field (on-site) fabrication of large gate<br>
panels that might be difficult to transport if they were manufactured at another location.<br>
The preferred method of casting the concrete panels may be to insert concrete form pieces<br>
into foundation 605a to form the underside of gate panel 614e, and then place the concrete<br>
with any necessary reinforcement, embedding movable hinge element 606 into the gate<br>
panel 614e, while fixing wire rope 601 b to hinge tube 601 c.<br>
Referring now to Figures 8a, 8b, 8c, and 8d, an automatic tripping system is<br>
shown. Strut 707h, which may be tubular, supports gate panel 714 against the pressure of<br>
upstream water. The lower end of strut 707h is supported against a step in spillway 705<br>
by rocking shoe 707k. Rocking shoe 707k is connected to a paddle 707j by connecting<br>
rod 707i. High water acting on paddle 707j acts to pull connecting rod 707i and rotate<br>
rocking shoe 7k toward a horizontal position, thereby releasing strut 707h and causing<br>
gate panel 714 to lower. In this manner multiple gate panels may be automatically<br>
lowered to protect against upstream flooding. Actuators with spillway 705 could<br>
optionally be used to force rocking shoes 707k to their horizontal positions, thereby<br>
lowering gate panels 714 by remote control.<br>
Referring now to Figures 63 through 71, an improved air fitting (or more generally,<br>
a pressurized fluid inlet element) 965 in accordance with one aspect of the present<br>
invention is shown. Air fitting 965 lacks damaging or damageable protrusions. Said fitting<br>
52<br>
965 may preferably be located between reinforcing plies 806, 807, and 808 within the<br>
lower membrane of an inflatable air bladder as herein disclosed.<br>
Said air fitting 86S may preferably be generally disk shaped and may feature a<br>
connection means such as pipe threads 865b at a centrally located through-hole.<br>
Said air fitting 963 may feature a tapered profile 965c which may limit undesirable<br>
changes in direction of reinforcing fabric plies 906, 907 and 908. Excessive changes in<br>
direction of reinforcing fabric might otherwise cause de-lamination of the layers of said<br>
reinforcing from each other or dis-bonding of said reinforcing from the embedded air<br>
fitting 96S.<br>
Said air fitting 965 may feature a rounded outer edge 965a which may prevent said<br>
fitting from cutting aforementioned reinforcing fabric.<br>
The radius R of said rounded outer edges may be sufficiently small, .0625 inches<br>
for example, such that the formation of voids at location 965d in the elastomer and the<br>
direct contact of reinforcing cords with said air fitting 965 may be avoided.<br>
Air fitting 965 may be comprised of or coated with a material which bonds to the<br>
elastomeric body of said inflatable bladder during vulcanization.<br>
Air fitting (or more generally, pressurized fluid inlet apparatus) 965 may comprise<br>
a pressurized fluid conveyer engagement element 3050 (which element can engage in<br>
some manner a pressurized fluid conveyer such as a hose or pipe); a thickness enhanced<br>
interior edge element 3051 (which element is an interior edge portion of the apparatus that<br>
is thicker than the remaining portion of the apparatus); a thickness reduced, exterior edge<br>
element 3052 (which is the radially exterior edge portion that is thinner than the thickness<br>
enhanced interior edge element) that is installed configuration contactable with an<br>
inflatable membrane separation curve 3053 proximate membrane 3054 (which is the<br>
inflatable membrane(s) that separates at the outer edge of the apparatus when the contact-<br>
adjacent layers diverge to pass around the apparatus); and a thickness varying body<br>
element 3055 located between said thickness enhanced interior edge element and said<br>
thickness reduced exterior edge element (which element forms the body of the apparatus<br>
53<br>
and connects the exterior edge element to the interior edge element 30S2 of the apparatus).<br>
The thickness enhanced interior edge element 30S1 may be a thickness enhanced,<br>
pressurized fluid conveyer engagement element proximate, interior edge element 30S7 in<br>
the case where the pressurized fluid conveyer engagement element 3050 is located at or<br>
near the center of the apparatus (as is the case if the pressurized fluid conveyer<br>
engagement element 3050 is a threaded engagement element 3060). The pressurized fluid<br>
inlet apparatus 3061 may also operate as a pressurized fluid outlet apparatus. The<br>
thickness reduced exterior edge element may be substantially circular (a descriptive term<br>
that applies even if there are notches 3062 in the exterior edge element). Further, the<br>
thickness reduced exterior edge element may be externally rounded 3064 to have an<br>
exterior edge radius of curvature 3065 that is sufficiently small to preclude void formation<br>
at the inflatable membrane separation curve 3053 (e.g., the radius of curvature may be<br>
approximately 0.0625 inches. The thickness reduced exterior edge element may also be<br>
rectangular (a descriptive term that includes square) in plan view. The thickness varying<br>
body element need not contact the interior edge element and/or the exterior edge element<br>
in order to be between the two and may have a frustral (truncated conical) internal<br>
(meaning closer to the inflatable cavity of the bladder) inflatable membrane contacting<br>
edge 3058 and an oppositely facing planar (substantially flat), annular, external inflatable<br>
membrane contacting edge 3059 (meaning this edge is towards the external atmosphere).<br>
Importantly, it is the above-mentioned shape of the apparatus that enables it to be<br>
positioned between contact-adjacent layers of an inflatable article, thereby resulting in a<br>
pressurized fluid inlet apparatus that is recessed from the outer surface of the inflatable<br>
article and that consequently can not be damaged by (nor damage) external parts over<br>
which, e.g., the bladder may slide.<br>
Related methods are also included in the ambit of the inventive technology. One<br>
such method of conveying pressurized fluid to and from an inflatable article comprises the<br>
steps of: dimensioning (e.g., shaping as, e.g., by molding) a pressurized fluid inlet element<br>
3061 having a pressurized fluid inlet element hole 3070; establishing the pressurized fluid<br>
inlet element 3061 between two contact-adjacent (meaning side-by-side and touching in<br>
sections) inflatable article layers (or inflatable membrane layers) 3071; and establishing an<br>
inflatable article layers hole co-axial with the pressurized fluid inlet element hole. The<br>
layers may be elastomeric or reinforced elastomeric layers; the inflatable article layers<br>
hole may thus be an elastomeric inflatable layers hole.<br>
54<br>
An abutment plate apparatus (or water gate panel slide friction abatement<br>
apparatus) may comprise a polymeric plate element 4000 dimensioned to contact a planar<br>
abutment seal face (which may be vertical, e.g.) 4001 throughout a possible water gate<br>
position edge sweep 4002 (a range of possible contact motion); and a plate-to-foundation<br>
surface attachment element 4020 (such as fastener holes 4004). The polymeric plate<br>
element 4000 may be a polyethylene plate element (ultra-high molecular weight<br>
polyethylene plate element and/or high density polyethylene plate element); may be a dark<br>
colored polymeric plate element 4005 (for thermal heating benefits); may be a high<br>
density polymeric plate element and/or an ultra-high molecular weight polymeric plate<br>
element); and may be a reinforced polymeric plate element (such as fiberglass) as but a<br>
few examples.<br>
Referring now to Figures 72a, 72b, 72c, 72d, 73 and 74, an abutment plate 966 of<br>
UHMW polyethylene and its associated anchor system is shown. Said abutment plate 66<br>
may feature low thermal conductivity, low ice adhesion, and a low coefficient of friction<br>
against the associated gate panel seals. Hole spacing dimensions X (of horizontally<br>
aligned fastener holes), and Y (of vertically aligned fastener holes) relative to thickness T<br>
may preferably be kept below 20 to I, or 12 to 1, and preferably at 8 to 1. The horizontal<br>
or vertical fastener hole separation distances divided by a polymeric plate element<br>
thickness (or the related horizontal fastener hole separation distance to plate thickness<br>
ratio and the vertical fastener hole separation distance to plate thickness ratio) may be less<br>
than approximately 20 (or less than approximately 20:1 expressed as a ratio), less than<br>
approximately 12 (or less than approximately 12:1 expressed as a ratio), or approximately<br>
equal to eight (or approximately 8:1 expressed as a ratio). A related index, the average,<br>
nearest fastener hole separation distance (measure of the average of the nearest fastener<br>
hole separation distances) divided by the thickness of the polymeric plate element (or the<br>
related average nearest fastener hole separation distance to plate thickness ratio) may be<br>
less than approximately 20 (or less than approximately 20:1 expressed as a ratio), less than<br>
approximately 12 (or less than approximately 20:1 expressed as a ratio), or approximately<br>
equal to eight (or approximately 8:1 expressed as a ratio). Of course, to determine the<br>
average, nearest fastener hole separation distance, all nearest fastener hole separation<br>
distances are measured and an average is calculated from the total. The method may<br>
55<br>
further comprise the step of recessing edges of fastener holes in order to retain a plate<br>
element surface flush, low thermal conductivity material, fastener recession filler.<br>
All fastener holes 4004 may have recessed fastener hole edges 400S in order to<br>
accommodate a plate element surface flush, low thermal conductivity material, fastener<br>
recession Filler, which may be, e.g., a plate element surface flush polyethylene, fastener<br>
recession filler. Plate element surface flush means that the filler material, as installed, will<br>
be level and flush with the abutment plate surface. The polymeric plate element may<br>
comprise a thermal plate buckling effect mitigative significant number of fastener holes<br>
(which is that number of fastener holes separated by only approximately even distances<br>
that is sufficient to prevent an operation impairing thermal plate buckling under expected<br>
operational environment conditions). The polymeric plate element may have a thermal<br>
plate buckling effect mitigative thickness (which is the thickness that is sufficient to<br>
prevent an operation impairing thermal plate buckling under expected operational<br>
environment conditions). The actual thickness dimension depends on whether the plate is<br>
attached through use of a thermal plate buckling effect mitigative significant number of<br>
fastener holes. Possible thickness dimensions may be approximately IS mm and<br>
approximately 25, but others dimensions are also possible.<br>
The polymeric plate element may be a unitary polymeric plate 4008 (i.e., one plate<br>
element) or may be a plurality of polymeric plates 4009, at least two of which may be<br>
adapted for separation in an installed configuration by a sealant accommodating groove<br>
4010. Anchoring may preferably be by means of countersunk bolts which may engage<br>
threaded concrete anchors 968. Bolts 967 may preferably be covered with a removable<br>
low thermal conductivity material such as polyethylene plugs or auto-body filler after<br>
installation.<br>
Related water gate slide friction abatement method may comprise the steps of<br>
dimensioning a polymeric material to form a substantially planar polymeric plate element<br>
4000 able to contact an abutment seal face 4015 throughout a possible water gate edge<br>
sweep 4002; and establishing a plate-to-foundation surface attachment element 4020 to<br>
which said substantially planar polymeric plate element 4000 is responsive. The<br>
polymeric material may be dark-colored, ultra high molecular weight, high density.<br>
polyethylene, or reinforced, e.g. The polyethylene material may be dark-colored, ultra<br>
56<br>
high molecular weight, high density, or reinforced, e.g. Reinforcement may be by<br>
fiberglass, e.g. Other steps include establishing a plurality of fastener holes separated by<br>
an average, nearest fastener hole separation distance.<br>
One embodiment of the interpanel seal (or more generally, impounded water<br>
leakage prevention apparatus) 73 may comprise an interpanel seal-to-foundation clamp<br>
retention enhancement element S001; an interpanel seal-to-foundation clampable retention<br>
element S002 responsive to said interpanel seal-to-foundation clamp retention<br>
enhancement element 5001; an upper, overflow orthogonal water gate panel edge<br>
conforming water seal hinge element S003 responsive to said interpanel seal-to-foundation<br>
clampable retention element S002; and an interpanel seal element S004 fixedly attachable<br>
to a first edge proximate portion 5006 of a first water gate panel S007 and a second edge<br>
proximate portion S008 of a second water gate panel S009, wherein said first edge<br>
proximate portion S006 of said first water gate panel S007 is situated adjacent to said<br>
second edge proximate portion 5008 of said second water gate panel S009 and said first<br>
water gate panel S007 is situated adjacent to said second water gate panel 5009. As is the<br>
case with all clamp retention enhancement elements, the interpanel seal-to-foundation<br>
clamp retention enhancement element 5002 may be an expanded cross-sectional area part<br>
5010 (maybe having a comma-shaped insert 5011) that serves to enhance the clamp action<br>
by providing an obstruction to movement of the clamped surface (of course, the interpanel<br>
seal-to-foundation clamp retention enhancement element 5001, as well as the interpanel<br>
seal-to-foundation clampable retention element 5002 operate to attach the interpanel seal<br>
73 to the foundation 5012, which may be, e.g., a dam spillway surface). The upper,<br>
overflow orthogonal water gate panel edge conforming water seal hinge element 5003 is<br>
the part of the apparatus that acts as the hinge and conforms to the overflow orthogonal<br>
(upstream, e.g.) water gate panel edge 5016 that, in an installed configuration, is the upper<br>
of the two upstream, e.g., water gate panel edges 5017. The interpanel seal element<br>
fixedly attachable to a first edge proximate portion 5006 of a first water gate panel 5007<br>
and a second edge proximate portion 5008 of a second water gate panel 5009 is the part<br>
that accomplishes most of the sealing between two adjacent (in an installed configuration)<br>
water gate panels (the first and the second water gate panel). The edge proximate portion<br>
of the water gate panels are those portions of the water gate panels that are near the edges<br>
of different water gate panels that are adjacent one another in an installed configuration.<br>
57<br>
Note that the interpanel seal element may be a substantially elongated interpanel seal<br>
element (meaning it has a length).<br>
The profiles) (cross sectional shape and size) of interpanel seal attachment<br>
elements may be approximately the same as the profiles of adjacent (or installed-<br>
configuration-adjacent) attachment elements (such as the installed-configuration-adjacent<br>
inflatable water gate actuator-to-foundation clamp retention enhancement element (see<br>
Figure 77), or the installed-configuration-adjacent water gate actuator-to-foundation<br>
clampable retention element (see Fig. 77)). Further, parts may be dimensioned to fit<br>
compression seal-tight against adjacent impounded water seal elements (see Figure 77)<br>
upon installation, meaning that an interference fit is created by sizing the parts so that their<br>
abutting edges compress against one another during installation. The term compression<br>
seal tight can also mean applying enough clamping pressure so that the clampable<br>
retention element S002 below the clamp S020 expands to tightly fit against an abutting<br>
installed clamp retention element. An overflow orthogonal, water gate actuator hinge flap<br>
element adjacent portion of the interpanel seal element S004 (that portion of the interpanel<br>
seal element that is adjacent the water gate actuator hinge flap element in an installed<br>
configuration) may be dimensioned to fit compression seal tight against an installed-<br>
configuration-adjacent inflatable water gate actuator hinge flap element. The foundation<br>
may be a spillway, e.g., and thus the interpanel seal-to-foundation clampable retention<br>
element 5002 may be an interpanel seal-to-spillway clampable retention element 5002.<br>
The upper, overflow orthogonal water gate panel edge conforming water seal hinge<br>
element 5003 may comprise an overflow orthogonal, vertical, interpanel seal-to-<br>
foundation clamp face abutting, corner-augmented edge element 5050, which is an edge of<br>
the hinge element that is augmented so as to form a corner 5051 that, in an installed<br>
configuration, abuts an overflow orthogonal (downstream, e.g.) vertical face 1051 of an<br>
interpanel seal-to-foundation clamp 118. Ideally, this edge element will be configured to<br>
abut substantially all proximate portions of the overflow orthogonal, interpanel seal to<br>
foundation clamp face 118 so as to effectively exclude seal and clamp operation<br>
compromising sand and other flow entrained particles and debris. A related method may<br>
include the step of corner augmenting (adding, e.g., elastomeric material to form a corner)<br>
an upper overflow orthogonal edge of the interpanel seal hinge element to conform to an<br>
overflow orthogonal, vertical interpanel seal-to-foundation clamp face edge (relatedly, see<br>
parts 1051 and 1052).<br>
58<br>
The interpanel seal element 5004 may project beyond a gate panel downstream<br>
limit S0S2 to form a nappe break element S0S3 or nappe breaker S0S3 (which serves to<br>
aerate any nappe that might form, thus avoiding the negative effects of oscillating nappes).<br>
This nappe break element may be an overtop flow mode dynamic object impact flexible<br>
nappe breaker (see Fig. 76) and may be, e.g., a reinforced elastomeric nappe breaker. The<br>
term overtop flow mode dynamic object impact flexible nappe breaker means that a nappe<br>
break element is made sufficiently flexible so as to absorb and flex without failure or<br>
substantial plastic deformation impacts from dynamic objects that one would expect to<br>
find flowing in an overtop flow.<br>
Rubber rafts and other small water craft (with and without passengers) are also<br>
possible items that one might expect to find flowing with an overtop flow. Here, the<br>
concern is for the safety of the passengers, and a sufficiently flexible nappe breaker (or<br>
one responsive to an impact flexure element) will flex when struck by a rubber raft instead<br>
of puncturing or cutting it as many conventional nappe breakers will. A related method<br>
may involve installation projecting (resulting in projection upon installation) the<br>
substantially elongated interpanel seal element beyond a gate panel downstream limit to<br>
create a nappe break element.<br>
Referring now to Figures 76 and 77, a dam spillway gate installation in accordance<br>
with one aspect of the present invention is shown in perspective view and exploded view<br>
respectively. Inter-panel seal 73 (a type of impounded water leakage prevention<br>
apparatus) may have the same profile under clamp bar 76 (the interpanel seal-to-<br>
foundation clampable retention element S002) as does air bladder clampable retention<br>
element (the inflatable water gate actuator-to-foundation clampable retention element).<br>
The adjoining faces of air bladder 903 and inter-panel seal 73 as well as the adjoining<br>
faces of air bladder 903 and abutment seal 75 and the adjoining faces of abutment plate<br>
966 and abutment seal 75 may preferably be shaped to fit tightly, perhaps with a slight<br>
interference fit, during installation. In this manner the subsequent application of clamping<br>
force from clamp bar 76 may cause the aforementioned adjoining elements to expand<br>
tightly against each other in a horizontal direction, thereby creating tightly sealed joints.<br>
The sealing of said joints may be supplemented by the use of thin flexible waterproof<br>
sheets (or thin waterproof seal supplement sheets) 70 and 74.<br>
59<br>
Referring now to Figure 78, a cross section of inter-panel seal 73 of Figures 76 and<br>
77 is shown. This inter-panel seal may function best if it is identical in profile to its<br>
associated, adjacent air bladder.<br>
Referring now to Figure 81, a perspective view of the interpanel seal 73 of Figures<br>
76 and 78 is shown.<br>
Referring now to Figures 79 and 80, an abutment seal 75 of Figures 76 and 77 is<br>
shown. The abutment seal apparatus (or impounded water seal apparatus) 75 may<br>
comprise an upper, impounded water seal element 6000 that is fixedly attachable to a<br>
foundation slide surface adjacent water gate panel 6001, which seal element itself features<br>
a flexible flap portion (or more generally a foundation slide surface adjacent, impounded<br>
water seal element) 80 which may be held tightly against its corresponding abutment plate<br>
or abutment (or more generally foundation slide surface) 6002 by a combination of water<br>
pressure and possible also elastic action; a water gate panel conformable seal element<br>
6003; and a longitudinal corner seal element 6004 and a thickness reduced, hingeable,<br>
upper, overflow orthogonal water gate panel edge conforming seal element 6006, and an<br>
abutment seal-to-foundation attachment element 82. The term foundation slide surface<br>
6002 is intended to include any material that, as either part of the foundation or as an<br>
attachment to it (e.g., an abutment plate), is the surface against which the impounded<br>
water seal (more specifically the foundation slide surface adjacent, impounded water seal<br>
element 80) slides during rotation of the water gate panel. Note that the foundation in a<br>
dam setting is the body of the dam (usually concrete) such as the spillway or the abutment;<br>
in the case of much smaller water impoundment application, the foundation is the body<br>
(underlying and side). In any water control application, the foundation is essentially the<br>
solid body parts that exist before the addition of supplemental water control parts and is<br>
what the supplemental parts may be attached to. The elastic action may be enhanced by<br>
the provision of reinforcing cords 79. A flexible portion (or termed differently, a<br>
thickness reduced, hingeable, upper, overflow orthogonal water gate panel edge<br>
conforming water seal element) 81 allows the abutment seal to bend with its associated<br>
bladder hinge flap (portion 862 in Figure 60a). Portion 82 may preferably match its<br>
associated air bladder in thickness (D) and length (B). The abutment seal apparatus may<br>
further comprise an abutment seal-to-foundation attachment element 82 which serves to<br>
60<br>
attach it to the foundation such as the spillway of a dam. This attachment element may<br>
comprise an abutment seal-to-foundation clampable retention element (which may be<br>
substantially flat, e.g.) and an abutment seal-to-foundation clamp retention enhancement<br>
element. Note that the abutment seal-to-foundation clampable retention element 6005 is<br>
termed substantially flat if it has a substantially flat upper or lower surface (a<br>
terminological definition that applies to any substantially flat clampable retention<br>
element). Flexible flap portion 80 may incorporate a low friction facing material such as<br>
polyethylene for use against abutments, faced with stainless steel or epoxy for example.<br>
Said facing may be unnecessary in the case of UHMW (ultra-high molecular weight)<br>
polyethylene abutment plates. The abutment seal-to-foundation clamp retention<br>
enhancement element 6007 may have a substantially circular cross-sectional insert, such<br>
as a comma-type insert 21. The abutment seal-to-foundation attachment element 82 may<br>
comprise a wedge-shaped abutment seal-to-foundation clamp retention element (see<br>
relatedly, part 10 of Figure 10), and may be configured to have an installed-configuration-<br>
adjacent wedge-shaped, gate panel actuator-to-foundation attachment element profile.<br>
The foundation slide surface adjacent, impounded water seal element may be an<br>
abutment plate adjacent impounded water seal element (meaning it is capable of being<br>
positioned adjacent to (or is actually so positioned) an abutment plate), or a concrete<br>
foundation slide surface adjacent impounded water seal element (meaning it is capable of<br>
being positioned adjacent to (or is actually so positioned) a concrete foundation slide<br>
surface). The abutment plate may be polymeric (such as polyethylene, e.g.) or stainless<br>
steel, or rubber, or any low friction wear material. Certain limitations as to the<br>
compatibility of sliding surfaces do exist, however - polyethylene (and polymers in<br>
general) slide best (i.e., with minimal friction) against rubber, stainless steel, and concrete.<br>
The foundation slide surface adjacent impounded water seal element may comprise a low<br>
friction wear impounded water seal element that may be a polymeric (such as<br>
polyethylene) seal element. The polyethylene may be an ultra high molecular weight<br>
polyethylene seal element and/or may be a high density polyethylene seal element. The<br>
polymeric seal element may be co-vulcanized to a reinforced elastomer containing EPDM<br>
(ethylene propylene diene methylene) rubber, or may be co-vulcanized to a reinforced<br>
elastomer comprising EPDM rubber and chlorobutyl. Additionally, the foundation slide<br>
surface adjacent impounded water seal element may instead comprise a rubber seal<br>
element or a stainless steel seal element. It may also be elastically angularly biased,<br>
61<br>
perhaps with a reinforcement ply enhanced bias, in order to improve the seal with the<br>
foundation slide surface. The thickness reduced, hingeable, upper, overflow orthogonal<br>
water gate panel edge conforming seal element may comprise a vertical, overflow<br>
orthogonal, abutment seal-to-foundation clamp face abutting, corner-augmented edge<br>
element 6010 that may be configured to abut substantially all proxmiate portions of an<br>
abutment seal-to-foundation clamp face 1051. Further, the thickness reduced, hingeable,<br>
upper, overflow orthogonal water gate panel edge conforming seal element and the<br>
abutment seal-to-foundation attachment element may be interference seal width<br>
dimensioned, meaning that the widths of these elements may be slightly oversized<br>
(perhaps by a quarter inch, e.g.) in order to allow tight compressive fitting upon<br>
installation. A heat element 6012 that may be any type of heater (electric, e.g.) may be<br>
installed (perhaps by integrally vulcanizing it into or substantially along the length of the<br>
foundation slide surface adjacent impounded water seal element) so that the foundation<br>
slide surface adjacent, impounded water seal element is thermally responsive to it and thus<br>
can prevent the formation of slide obstructing ice. The term substantially along the length<br>
includes substantially along only a majority portion of the length.<br>
Referring now to Figures 82a, 82b, 82c, 82d, and 86, an abutment seal is show in<br>
accordance with one aspect of the present invention which may be configured for use in<br>
conjunction with a wedge type clamping system as is depicted in Figure86. Wedge<br>
portion 84 may be configured to match the adjoining hinge member 86 in cross section.<br>
Bendable portion 81 permits abutment seal 75 to flex with hinge member 86 as gate panel<br>
914 is lowered and raised. Reinforced portion 85 may be clamped to gate panel 914.<br>
Flexible portion 80 may ride against adjoining abutment plate 966 while held in a tightly<br>
sealed position by a combination of elastic forces and water pressure. Face 87 is<br>
preferably fitted to adjoining hinge member 86 with a slight interference fit. Flexible<br>
portion 80 may feature a low friction surface 88 comprised of UHMW polyethylene for<br>
example. Sealing face 89 is preferably designed to tightly fit the adjoining abutment plate.<br>
Due to the small distance of travel of this portion of the abutment seal, low friction facing<br>
88 may generally not be required or desirable, but may be included nonetheless, in certain<br>
applications, for certain reasons.<br>
Referring now to Figures 88, 89, 90, and 91, an inflatable dam (or inflatable<br>
elastomeric dam) in accordance with one aspect of the present invention is shown. Swirl<br>
62<br>
inducing ribs 93 may be provided in alternating directions such that the direction flow of<br>
water over said inflatable dam may be altered to include a horizontal component normal to<br>
the primary direction of flow. In combination said horizontal flow components will in<br>
turn form opposing circulating flow patterns 96 and 97 which include velocity components<br>
normal to the body of the inflated dam. In this manner the effect of the fin 95 may be<br>
augmented. Stable operation may be possible at higher degrees of overtopping than would<br>
be possible with a fin arrangement only. Stress relief shape 94 may reduce internal<br>
stresses in the inflated dam and may increase the stiffness of the cantilevered fin feature<br>
95. Inflatable dam 983 may be fixed to dam spillway or foundation 995 by means of<br>
clamp 101 and spillway groove 102.<br>
A nappe aeration apparatus that avoids the nuisance and potentially destructive<br>
effects of oscillating or vibrating nappes while remaining resistant to destruction by debris<br>
overflowing impoundment structure and remaining relatively harmless to water craft is<br>
also within the ambit of the inventive technology. A nappe aeration apparatus may<br>
comprise an overtop flow mode dynamic object impact flexible nappe break element<br>
9500; and a disengagable, flexible nappe break element-to-water impoundment element<br>
attachment element 9501 to which said overtop flow mode dynamic object impact flexible<br>
nappe break element is responsive. The term disengagable, flexible nappe break element-<br>
to-water impoundment element attachment element 9501 refers to a part (which could<br>
even comprise magnets and/or bolt holes, e.g.) that allows removal of the nappe breaker.<br>
The term overtop flow mode dynamic object impact flexible nappe break element means<br>
that a nappe break element is made sufficiently flexible (elastically, meaning after an<br>
impact it returns substantially to its pre-impact configuration) so as to absorb and flex<br>
without failure or substantial plastic deformation impacts from dynamic objects that one<br>
would expect to find flowing in an overtop flow. Rubber rafts and other small water craft<br>
(with and without passengers) are also possible items that one might expect to find<br>
flowing with an overtop flow. Here, the concern is for the safety of the passengers, and a<br>
sufficiently flexible nappe breaker will flex when struck by a rubber raft instead of<br>
puncturing or cutting it as many inflexible nappe breakers will. The nappe break element<br>
may be an a rein forced, elastomer ic nappe breaker.<br>
Another nappe aeration apparatus may comprise a nappe break element 9505; a<br>
disengagable nappe break element-to-water impoundment element attachment element<br>
63<br>
9S06 to which said nappe break element is responsive; and an overtop flow mode dynamic<br>
object impact flexure element 9S07 to which said nappe break element is responsive.<br>
Essentially, in this second apparatus, the flex upon impact is provided not by the nappe<br>
breaker itself (such type of flex would be allowed by nappe breakers made from<br>
elastomers), but instead by a discrete flexure element such as a helical spring element or a<br>
flexible mounting stem (as but a few examples) to which the nappe breaker is responsive<br>
(as by attachment, e.g.) and which flexes (elastically, meaning after an impact it returns<br>
substantially to its pre-iinpact configuration) so as to absorb without failure or substantial<br>
plastic deformation impacts from dynamic objects that one would expect to find flowing in<br>
an overtop flow. Even if what appears to be the attachment element serves to allow<br>
flexure upon impact (e.g., in the case of a flexible stem), the attachment element is defined<br>
to be merely that part that enables attachment (perhaps there are fastener holes at the<br>
bottom of the stem or a surface at the bottom of the stem that can be epoxied and later<br>
removed), thus maintaining the discreteness of the different elements of the apparatus.<br>
An improved impounded water control system operation maintenance apparatus<br>
may involve an excessive water gate panel rotation prevention element that, in a storage<br>
configuration, does not aesthetically impair the impoundment structure's (such as a dam)<br>
appearance. The improved impounded water control system operation maintenance<br>
apparatus may comprise a tensionable, excessive bottom-hinged water gate panel rotation<br>
prevention element 7020 (any material that is tension strong such as restraining straps that<br>
are made from nylon or an elastomeric material or an elastomeric cord, as but a few<br>
examples, and able to prevent excessive rotation of a water gate panel); a lower, excessive<br>
gate rotation prevention element-to-foundation attachment element 7001 (which serves to<br>
attach the tensionable excessive bottom-hinged water gate panel rotation prevention<br>
element to the foundation) to which the tensionable, excessive bottom-hinged water gate<br>
panel rotation prevention element is responsive and that is fixedly established between<br>
oppositely facing ends 7002 of end-proximate water gate panel actuators 7003; and an<br>
excessive gate rotation prevention element-to-gate panel attachment element (which serves<br>
to attach the tensionable, excessive, bottom-hinged water gate panel rotation prevention<br>
element 7020 to a portion of the water gate panel 70S2) responsive to the tensionable,<br>
excessive bottom-hinged water gate panel rotation prevention element 103. The end-<br>
adjacent water gate panel actuators 7003 may be end-adjacent inflatable water gate panel<br>
actuation bladders 700S, and a downstream-most edge of the end-adjacent inflatable water<br>
64<br>
gate panel actuation bladders 7006 may be located substantially at a drip plane 106.<br>
Further, each of the end-proximate water gate panel actuators 7003 may be responsive to<br>
at least one water gate actuator to foundation attachment element 7007, which may be a<br>
wedge-shaped, gate panel actuator-to-foundation clamp retention element 7008. In such a<br>
case, the apparatus may further comprise a wedge-shaped, gate panel actuator-to-<br>
foundation clamp retention element substitute insert 105 positioned substantially between<br>
opposing ends of proximate, wedge-shaped gate panel actuator-to-foundation clamp<br>
retention elements 7009. Such an insert may be termed an adjacent water gate actuator-to-<br>
foundation profile mimicking insert I OS. The end-proximate water gate panel actuators<br>
may be end-proximate water gate panel floatation elements instead of inflatable actuators.<br>
A tensionable, excessive bottom-hinged water gate panel rotation prevention element<br>
length 7010, an upper, excessive gate rotation prevention element-to-gate panel<br>
attachment element location 7011, and a lower, excessive gate rotation prevention<br>
element-to-foundation attachment element location 7012 may be correlated so that a<br>
downstream-most end of said tensionable, excessive bottom-hinged water gate panel<br>
rotation prevention element 7020 is located substantially under a water control gate panel<br>
element 70S2 in a lowered configuration (Fig. 93) thus precluding the unsightly<br>
appearance of protruding excessive gate panel rotation prevention apparatus in a lowered<br>
configuration 104. The tensionable, excessive bottom-hinged water gate panel rotation<br>
prevention element 7020 may be a tensionable, collapsible excessive bottom hinged water<br>
gate panel rotation prevention element 103, meaning that it can be folded or telescoped or<br>
coiled, e.g., or somehow amenable to reconfiguration from its tension mode shape to a<br>
different storage configuration when the tension is relieved. An actuatable water gate<br>
panel water control system (i.e., the water gate pane actuator, the gate panels and any<br>
sealing apparatus) that further comprises any of the above-mentioned improved<br>
impounded water control system apparatus is also deemed within the ambit of the<br>
inventive technology.<br>
A separate improved impounded water control system operation maintenance<br>
apparatus that address the inventive out-of-the way configuration of excessive water gate<br>
panel rotation prevention elements in the area of abutments may comprise: a tensionable.<br>
excessive bottom-hinged water gate panel rotation prevention element; a lower, excessive<br>
gate rotation prevention element-to-foundation attachment element 7012 to which said<br>
tensionable, excessive bottom-hinged water gate panel rotation prevention element 7020 is<br>
65<br>
responsive and that is fixedly established between a water gate panel actuator and a<br>
substantially vertical foundation surface (see Fig. 107); and an upper, excessive gate<br>
rotation prevention element-to-gate panel attachment element 7011 responsive to said<br>
tensionable, excessive bottom-hinged water gate panel rotation prevention element 7010.<br>
The apparatus may comprise a wedge-shaped, gate panej, actuator-to-foundation clamp<br>
retention element substitute insert I OS positioned substantially between a wedge-shaped<br>
gate panel actuator-to-foundation clamp retention element 9S72 and a substantially<br>
vertical foundation surface 9571. Of course this and other substitute inserts are intended<br>
to take the place of the length of inflatable water gate panel actuator-to-foundation<br>
attachment element(s) that do not exist because of the shortening of the inflatable bladders<br>
that may take place in order to accommodate out-of-sight placement of the excessive gate<br>
panel rotation prevention element substantially below the gap between adjacent water gate<br>
panels. This placement is preferable to those approaches that reduce the cross-sectional<br>
size of the inflatable bladders to insufficient levels so that the length of the excessive gate<br>
panel rotation prevention elements (such as restraining straps, e.g.) positioned downstream<br>
(or upstream in a system whose actuator is on an impounded flow side) of the inflatable<br>
bladder need not exceed that length that results in protrusion of the straps, e.g., in a<br>
lowered configuration.<br>
A related method for improving the appearance of a lowered configuration water<br>
control gate system comprises the steps of dimensioning (meaning shaping as by some<br>
manufacturing process, e.g.) a tensionable, excessive bottom-hinged water gate panel<br>
rotation prevention element 7020; establishing a lower, excessive gate rotation prevention<br>
element-to-foundation attachment element 7012 to which said tensionable, excessive<br>
bottom-hinged water gate panel rotation prevention element 7020 is responsive and that is<br>
fixedly established between proximate ends 7029 of proximate, vertically projecting flow<br>
control elements 7030; and establishing an upper, excessive gate rotation prevention<br>
element-to-gate panel attachment element responsive to said tensionable, collapsable,<br>
excessive bottom-hinged water gate panel rotation prevention element 7020. The<br>
vertically projection flow control elements 7030 may be any flow control elements that<br>
project vertically, such as water gate panel actuators (such as inflatable water gate panel<br>
actuator bladders, or floatable water gate panel actuators), or foundation slide surfaces<br>
such as abutment surfaces. In one embodiment, the method may further comprise the step<br>
of establishing a wedge-shaped, gate panel actuator-to-foundation clamp retention element<br>
66<br>
substitute insert substantially below a wedge-shaped interpanel seal-to-foundation clamp<br>
retention element and between impounded flow proximate (meaning upstream in a<br>
configuration where the actuator is on the downstream side of the gate panel; and<br>
downstream in a configuration where the actuator is on the upstream side of the gate<br>
panel) opposing ends (oppositely facing) of proximate, vertically projecting flow control<br>
elements. The method may further comprise the step of correlating the length of the<br>
tensionable, excessive bottom-hinged water gate panel rotation prevention element 7020<br>
with a location of each of the lower, excessive gate rotation prevention element-to-<br>
foundation attachment element 7012 and the upper, excessive gate rotation prevention<br>
element-to-gate panel attachment element 7011 so that a downstream-most end 7021 of a<br>
detensioned, non-restraint configuration (e.g., collapsed and/or folded), tensionable,<br>
excessive bottom-hinged water gate panel rotation prevention element 7040 is located<br>
under a lowered water control gate panel 914.<br>
Referring to Figures 92, 93, 94, and 95, a bottom hinged air actuated gate in<br>
accordance with the present invention is shown. Restraining straps, e.g. 1003 may be<br>
located at the ends of air bladders 333 so that the air bladder size may be maximized or<br>
optimized. Generally, for gates over 2.S meters high, the air bladder should be made as<br>
large as possible without extending beyond drip line 106. This results in a conventional<br>
restraining strap 104 which protrudes from beneath lowered gate panel 914. Protruding<br>
restraining straps may be deemed undesirable by some customers or owners. Gate panel<br>
914 is preferably convexly curved to provide sufficient bending strength to accept the<br>
restraining strap loads at it ends. Air bladders 334 may be shortened enough to allow<br>
clearance for restraining straps 103 in both the raised and lowered positions. Insert 10S,<br>
which may be made from reinforced rubber for example, may be used to fill the clamping<br>
system between air bladders 334 which do not directly adjoin due to the extra clearance C<br>
that may be provided for restraining straps 103.<br>
Referring now to Figure El 1, the details of the preferred hinge means are shown.<br>
Movable gussets 806 are welded to movable hinge tube la. Fixed gussets 804 are welded<br>
to actuator guide tube 804a and to fixed hinge tube 801c. Hinge tubes 801a and 801c are<br>
held in proper relationship by wire rope 801b, which may follow a spiral Figure 8 around<br>
hinge tubes 801a and 801c. The wire rope 801 b is prevented from slipping by embedment<br>
in concrete between gussets 806 and gussets 804. The zone of rolling contact between<br>
67<br>
wire rope 801b and hinge tubes 801a and 801 c is left clear of concrete or other fixing<br>
means. In the case of a wire rope fixed with concrete, should the need arise to repair the<br>
hinge, the concrete between gussets may be selectively removed with a high pressure<br>
water jet.<br>
Referring now to Figure El2, a plan view of the arrangement depicted in Figure<br>
El I is shown.<br>
Referring now to Figure C2 a detailed cross section is shown, in the gate-lowered<br>
position, of the hinge shown in the gate assembly of Figure Cl. Gate panel 401 may<br>
incorporate slots 402 through which cord 45 may pass in a "figure 8" pattern, thereby<br>
connecting the gate panel 401 to a fixed element 49. Fixed element 49 may have rounded<br>
edges so as to not cut cord 45 and may be fixed to embedded frame 406 by mounting bolts<br>
416.<br>
Referring now to Figures and C5 and C6, Figure C5 shows a plan view of a gate<br>
assembly hinge; fig C6 shows an edge on side view of a gate assemly hinge. Fixed<br>
structural member 409 may be connected to movable structural member 442 by means of<br>
flexible tensile member 445 which may pass through rounded edge slots 402 in structural<br>
members 409 and 442. Upper elastomeric cover 412 may be bonded to structural members<br>
409 and 442 as well as flexible tensile member 445. Flexible tensile member 445 may<br>
also be bonded to structural members 409 and 442 except where rolling contact may occur<br>
between structural members 409 and 442.<br>
Referring now to Figure C7, flexible tensile member 445 may be wrapped around<br>
tubular members 438 and bonded thereto in the region without rolling action 440 but not<br>
bonded to the tubular members 438 in the region of rolling contact 441. Tubular members<br>
438 may be connected to structural members 439 which may in turn be part of or attach to<br>
the remainder of the hinged and fixed structures.<br>
Referring now to Figures 96, 97 and 98, three different hinges are depicted - an<br>
"S" hinge, an integrated figure eight hinge, and a modular figure eight hinge - each of<br>
which is within the ambit of the inventive subject matter. The hinge depicted in Figures<br>
87a and 87b may be termed a "W" hinge. The hinges themselves, in a general context that<br>
68<br>
includes many applications in addition to water control, are inventive and each considered<br>
patentable.<br>
As can be easily understood from the foregoing, the basic concepts of the present<br>
invention may be embodied in a variety of ways. It involves both water control and<br>
actuator techniques as well as devices to accomplish the appropriate water control or<br>
actuation. In this application, the water control techniques are disclosed as part of the<br>
results shown to be achieved by the various devices described and as steps which are<br>
inherent to utilization. They are simply the natural result of utilizing the devices as<br>
intended and described. In addition, while some devices are disclosed, it should be<br>
understood that these not only accomplish certain methods but also can be varied in a<br>
number of ways. Importantly, as to all of the foregoing, all of these facets should be<br>
understood to be encompassed by this disclosure.<br>
The discussion included in this application is intended to serve as a basic<br>
description. The reader should be aware that the specific discussion may not explicitly<br>
describe all embodiments possible; many alternatives are implicit. It also may not fully<br>
explain the generic nature of the invention and may not explicitly show how each feature<br>
or element can actually be representative of a broader function or of a great variety of<br>
alternative or equivalent elements. Again, these are implicitly included in this disclosure.<br>
Where the invention is described in device-oriented terminology, each element of the<br>
device implicitly performs a function. Apparatus claims may not only be included for the<br>
device described, but also method or process claims may be included to address the<br>
functions the invention and each element performs. Neither the description nor the<br>
terminology is intended to limit the scope of the claims included in this patent application.<br>
M<br>
It should also be understood that a variety of changes may be made without<br>
departing from the essence of the invention. Such changes are also implicitly included in<br>
the description. They still fall within the scope of this invention. A broad disclosure<br>
encompassing both the explicit embodiment(s) shown, the great variety of implicit<br>
alternative embodiments, and the broad methods or processes and the like are<br>
encompassed by this disclosure and may be relied upon for the claims for this patent<br>
application. It should be understood that such language changes and broad claiming is<br>
accomplished in this filing. This patent application will seek examination of as broad a<br>
69<br>
base of claims as deemed within the applicant's right and will be designed to yield a patent<br>
covering numerous aspects of the invention both independently and as an overall system.<br>
Further, each of the various elements of the invention and claims may also be<br>
achieved in a variety of manners. This disclosure should be understood to encompass each<br>
such variation, be it a variation of an embodiment of any apparatus embodiment, a method<br>
or process embodiment, or even merely a variation of any element of these. Particularly, it<br>
should be understood that as the disclosure relates to elements of the invention, the words<br>
for each element may be expressed by equivalent apparatus terms or method terms - even<br>
if only the function or result is the same. Such equivalent, broader, or even more generic<br>
terms should be considered to be encompassed in the description of each element or<br>
action. Such terms can be substituted where desired to make explicit the implicitly broad<br>
coverage to which this invention is entitled. As but one example, it should be understood<br>
that all actions may be expressed as a means for taking that action or as an element which<br>
causes that action. Similarly, each physical element disclosed should be understood to<br>
encompass a disclosure of the action which that physical element facilitates. Regarding<br>
this last aspect, as but one example, the disclosure of a "means for actuating" or an<br>
"actuator" should be understood to encompass disclosure of the act of "actuating" ~<br>
whether explicitly discussed or not — and, conversely, were there effectively disclosure of<br>
the act of "actuating", such a disclosure should be understood to encompass disclosure of<br>
an "actuator" and even a "means for actuating". Such changes and alternative terms are to<br>
be understood to be explicitly included in the description.<br>
Any acts of law, statutes, regulations, or rules mentioned in this application for<br>
patent; or patents, publications, or other references mentioned in this application for patent<br>
are hereby incorporated by reference. In addition, as to each term used it should be<br>
understood that unless its utilization in this application is inconsistent with such<br>
interpretation, common dictionary definitions should be understood as incorporated for<br>
each term and all definitions, alternative terms, and synonyms such as contained in the<br>
Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary, second edition are hereby incorporated<br>
by reference. Finally, all references listed in the list of References To Be Incorporated By<br>
Reference In Accordance With The Patent Application or other information disclosure<br>
statement or citation filed with the application are hereby appended and hereby<br>
incorporated by reference, however, as to each of the above, to the extent that such<br>
70<br>
information or statements incorporated by reference might be considered inconsistent with<br>
the patenting of this/these invention(s) such statements are expressly not to be considered<br>
as made by the applicants).<br>
Thus, the applicant(s) should be understood to claim at least: i) each of the water<br>
control actuator devices as herein disclosed and described, ii) the related methods<br>
disclosed and described, iii) similar, equivalent, and even implicit variations of each of<br>
these devices and methods, iv) those alternative designs which accomplish each of the<br>
functions shown as are disclosed and described, v) those alternative designs and methods<br>
which accomplish each of the functions shown as are implicit to accomplish that which is<br>
disclosed and described, vi) each feature, component, and step shown as separate and<br>
independent inventions, vii) the applications enhanced by the various systems or<br>
components disclosed, viii) the resulting products produced by such systems or<br>
components, and ix) methods and apparatuses substantially as described hereinbefore and<br>
with reference to any of the accompanying examples, x) the various combinations and<br>
permutations of each of the elements disclosed, and xi) each potentially dependent claim<br>
or concept as a dependency on each and every one of the independent claims or concepts<br>
presented. In this regard it should be understood that for practical reasons and so as to<br>
avoid adding potentially hundreds of claims, the applicant may eventually present claims<br>
with initial dependencies only. Support should be understood to exist to the degree<br>
required under new matter laws — including but not limited to European Patent<br>
Convention Article 123(2) and United States Patent Law 35 USC 132 or other such laws--<br>
to permit the addition of any of the various dependencies or other elements presented<br>
under one independent claim or concept as dependencies or elements under any other<br>
independent claim or concept. Further, if or when used, the use of the transitional phrase<br>
"comprising" is used to maintain the "open-end" claims herein, according to traditional<br>
claim interpretation. Thus, unless the context requires otherwise, it should be understood<br>
that the term "comprise" or variations such as "comprises" or "comprising", are intended<br>
to imply the inclusion of a stated element or step or group of elements or steps but not the<br>
exclusion of any other element or step or group of elements or steps. Such terms should<br>
be interpreted in their most expansive form so as to afford the applicant the broadest<br>
coverage legally permissible.<br>
