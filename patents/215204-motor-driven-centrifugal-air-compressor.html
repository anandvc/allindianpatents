				<td>The present invention relates to a motor-driven compressor assembly.<br>
This invention relates generally to systems for supplying compressed air and,, more particularly, to motor-driven centrifugal air compressors and the use of compressed air for charging the cylinders of an internal combustion engine and for pneumatic conveying of dry bulk materials and for various other industrial processes.<br>
Background of the  Invention<br>
Motor-driven compressors currently in use consist of a high-speed, brushless motor mounted in an aluminum housing attached to the back plate of centrifugal compressor.  One current motor-driven compressor is shown in Fig. 1.  As indicated in Fig. 1, the compressor wheel and casing are similar to those used in commercial internal combustion engine turbochargers.  In the operation of such air compressors, the motor is energized from an external power source, such as a battery, through an electronic controller which changes the direct current from the battery to alternating current to produce a rotating magnetic field in the motor windings. The rotating field surrounding the motor magnets attached to the motor shaft generates torque that rotates the compressor wheel and shaft assembly. The compressor wheel induces air from the atmosphere or from an appropriate air cleaner and delivers it from the compressor casing at pressures above atmospheric pressure.<br>
In current motor-driven air compressors, the amount of power produced by the motor on a continuous basis is limited by the temperature generated in the windings and by the temperature level in the electronic controller from the electrical power losses therein.  Conventional low-speed motors usually employ, some sort of an internal fan attached to the shaft to produce a flow of cooling air through the motor and around its internal<br>
components to limit their temperatures, however, with high-speed, brushless motors the use of internal fans become rather difficult to implement.<br>
Summary nf the Invention<br>
'Accordingly, there is provided a motor-driven compressor assembly, comprising a compressor air intake, a compressor rotor, a compressed air outlet and an electric motor for said compressor rotor, said air intake of the compressor assembly being located so as to direct intake airflow to the compressor rotor into a heat transfer relationship with the electric motor.<br>
The invention provides a motor-driven compressor assembly, comprising a compressor air intake, a compressor rotor, a compressed air outlet and an electric motor for said compressor rotor, with the air intake of the compressor assembly being located so as to direct intake airflow to the compressor rotor into a heat transfer relationship with the electric motor. In 'the invention, the motor-driven compressor includes an outer casing and a housing for the electric motor that together form the air intake so the intake airflow through the air intake so formed cools the motor housing.  The motor housing is, in preferred embodiments, a central barrel carrying the electric motor within an outer casing so the intake airflow surrounds the central barrel.  The outer casing may also form a mounting surface for motor control electronics, and provide inner finned surfaces in the path of the intake airflow to cool the control electronics.   Some embodiments of the invention include an operable air bypass between the compressor's air intake and compressed air outlet for use in some applications.<br>
In motor-driven centrifugal air compressors of the invention, the components of the assembly are so arranged to utilize the intake airflow of the centrifugal compressor as a cooling media for both the motor components and control electronics to overcome the temperature limitations to power output from uncooled motor components.<br>

Description of the Invention<br>
A preferred motor-driven centrifugal air compressor 10 of the invention is shown in cross-section in Fig. 2. In the motor-driven air compressor of Fig. 2, the compressor wheel 11 is mounted on a motor-driven "shaft 12 with the air intake of the vanes 13 facing the motor 14. The motor magnet assembly 15 is constructed by encapsulating the magnets on the shaft 12 by an outer cylindrical sleeve 16. The motor windings 17 are mounted in a motor housing 18 within an outer casing 19. non showings Drawing <br>
As shown in Fig. 2, the outer casing 19 and motor housing 18 form<br><br>
	the air intake 20 the compressor vanes 13 so that upon rotation of the<br>
compressor wheel 11 by the electric motor 14, the compressor vanes 13 draw an intake airflow through the air intake passage 20 formed between the outer casing 19, and motor housing 18. The intake air to compressor wheel 11 flows adjacent and in heat transfer relationship with the electric motor 14, that is, the intake airflow cools the motor housing 18 and thereby the motor windings 17, and the motor windings 17 are maintained at a lower temperature than if the motor housing were in contact with static ambient atmosphere as in the Fig. 1 apparatus.  In addition, the ends of the motor housing 18 may be provided with openings 22 and 23 permitting the rotating compressor vanes 13 to induce a cooling airflow through the interior of motor housing 18 more directly adjacent the motor windings 17 and adjacent the motor magnets 15.<br>
Ball bearings 24, 25 rotatably support the shaft 12 at the ends of the motor housing 18 as shown.  A housing end cover 26 is retained in the motor<br>
housing 18 by retaining ring 27, and spring 28 is provided to ensure the proper pre-loading on the ball bearings 24, 25.<br>
In the preferred embodiment shown in Fig. 2, the motor housing 18 is a central barrel located coaxially within and surrounded by the outer casing 19. The central barrel 18 is thus surrounded by the intake air passage 20 and is attached to the outer casing 19 by ribs 29. Air is induced through intake air passage 20 and through openings 22, 23 in the central barrel 18 by rotation of compressor wheel 11.  The airflow over the central barrel 18 and adjacent the motor windings 17 cools the motor parts, keeping them at lower and "acceptable operating temperatures.  The intake air is compressed by the rotation of compressor wheel 11, passes through diffuser passage 30, and flows into the compressor casing 31.<br>
A tangential outlet (not shown) from the compressor casing 31 can be, for example, connected to the air intake system of an internal combustion engine or the intake air system of some other industrial process that requires compressed air.<br>
   The motor wires non showing  drawings32 exit the end plate 26 through one of the openings<br>
and can be led to an appropriate electronic control unit (not shov/n in Fig.<br>
2), which controls operation of the motor 14.<br>
An alternate preferred embodiment 33 of the invention is illustrated in Fig. 3.  As illustrated in Fig, 3, one section 19a of the outer casing 19 protrudes to provide a mounting cavity 34 for the control electronics (not shown).  The inner surface 35 of the outer casing adjacent the mounting cavity 34 includes a series of fins 36 in the intake airflow that can transfer heat<br>
generated in the control electronics to the intake airflow. Wire outlet 37 from <br>
not showing drawings the mounting cavity 34 is provided to permit electric current from a power source to enter the control electronics through electrical conduit38.<br>
The motors of existing motor-driven compressors usually have the motor windings connected to a remotely located controller, necessitating an appreciable length of control wires that must be protected from damage. The<br>
present invention eliminates the need for protecting control wires by forming a cooled mounting for the electronics as an integral part of the outer casing 19 and allows the inner surface of the mounting to incorporate cooling fins in the intake air stream as a heat sink.<br>
The invention also provides motor-driven compressors for use in series with a turbocharger compressor on an internal combustion engine.  An embodiment of motor-driven compressor 40 of the invention for such applications can include an internal air bypass valve 41 within the motor-driven compressor housing, as illustrated in Fig. 4.  In such applications, a motor-driven compressor of Fig. 4 is provided upstream of the air intake of a conventional turbocharger for an internal combustion engine and is driven by the electrical system of the internal combustion engine to provide a flow of compressed air through the turbocharger air intake when the internal combustion engine is operating at idle or low speeds and the conventional turbocharger cannot supply a desirable flow of cylinder charge air.  When the intern?!! combustion engine is operating at rated load and speed in such systems, the motor-driven compressor may be de-energized to eliminate the use of electrical energy from the internal combustion engine electrical system, and the internal bypass valve 41 can be opened to allow the engine turbocharger to obtain its intake airflow with minimal resistance through the motor-driven compressor 40. As shown in Fig. 4, the air bypass valve 41 can be formed by a flapper 42 hinged to and supported by the outer casing 19 between the air intake passage 20 and the compressor casing 31.  The flapper 42 may be operated by an electrical solenoid (not shown) mounted to the outer casing 19 and connected with an operating arm (not shown) attached to flapper 42.<br>
The sequence of operation of such internal combustion engine systems is as follows: When the internal combustion engine is started, the motor-driven compressor 40 is energized to a first speed level at which it provides a significant boost pressure to the internal combustion engine in preparation for<br><br>
engine acceleration under load. This level of boost is much higher than can be supplied by the engine turbocharger alone under these engine operating conditions. When the engine throttle is opened to accelerate the engine, the motor-driven compressor 40 is super-energized, for example, by increasing its speed of rotation with the control electronics, to assist the engine turbocharger in providing boost pressure during the acceleration period. When the engine turbocharger has reached a level where it is capable of supplying sufficient charge air for efficient combustion of the injected fuel, the motor-driven compressor is de-energized by the control electronics.  The internal bypass \alve 41 opens anytime the pressure in the compressor casing 31 falls below the pressure in the intake air passage 20. This allows the engine turbocharger to draw intake air through the motor-driven compressor with minimal resistance to the flow.<br>
If a motor-driven compressor of the invention 10, 33 is to be used for an application such as pneumatic conveying of dry bulk material, the air intake openings of the outer casings 19 may be fitted with an appropriate air filter. In other applications requiring compressed air, a simple screen to keep out foreign material may be used. Mounting feet may be located at convenient places on the outer casing 19, depending on the type of service in which the compressor is to be used.<br>
Integrating the compressor components, motor components, and electronic control in a single compact structure, where intake airflow is used to cool the motor parts, provides an economical, compact assembly that has a high power output rating by virtue of the large volume of the intake airflow that is used for cooling the electric motor, and the incorporation of an air bypass valve extends the applications in which such motor-driven compressors may be used.<br>
