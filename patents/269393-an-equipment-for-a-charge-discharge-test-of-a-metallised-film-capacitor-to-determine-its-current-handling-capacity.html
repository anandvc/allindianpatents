It also relates to method of manufacturing a capacitor which includes charge/discharge as one of the step to achieve desired characteristics of the metallised plastic film capacitor for CDI application.<br>
PRIOR ART :<br>
The self healing property and current handling capacity of the metallised plastic film capacitor offers a distinct advantage over the film foil capacitors. These properties depends upon the contact/adhesion between metal coating on the plastic film and the metal sprayed on both sides of capacitor element to form the two contact metal plates of the plastic film capacitor and result of the extreme thinness of the metallised electrode material. If the contact is weak then a contact resistance is formed. When current passes through this contact resistance, heat is generated resulting in shrinkage of metallised plastic film and not withstanding the required current. Wherever improvement in performance, withstanding current carrying capacity and avoidance of premature failure of a metallised plastic film capacitor charging/discharging is a must ie.e simulation of field condition for CDI explication..<br><br><br>
The absence of Charge/Discharge test while manufacturing leads to:<br>
1.	Loose contact<br>
2.	Arcing<br>
3.	End spray metal on body which will reduce Insulation Resistance<br>
4.	Short circuit of capacitor<br>
5.	hjratic tan delta readings<br>
6.	More power loss across the capacitor leading to heating of capacitor<br>
7.	More capacitance loss leading to reduce life span of capacitor and CDI unit.<br>

Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide and equipment an method for current handling apacity of a capacitor due to, end spray metal and termination contact.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to check erratic change in tan delta readings, power loss across the plastic film capacitor.<br>
