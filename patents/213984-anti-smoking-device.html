				<td>TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Anti-smoking device<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the invention<br>
This invention relates to the tobacco art, and more particularly, to a device for<br>
introducing a wetied impact barrier into a smoking article.<br>
Description of the prior art<br>
There have been attempts to design tar and nicotine reducing elements for<br>
tobacco smoke described in the prior art and several of these elements contain means for<br>
moistening or humidifying a porous filter. Typically, a frangible module containing<br>
water or an aqueous solution is embedded in the filter and the module is compressed to<br>
release the liquid before the filter is used. The moistened filter material in the element<br>
then exhibits an improved ability to remove primary tars, nicotine, and certain other<br>
volatiles from the smoke.<br>
For example, in U.S. Patent No. 3,884,246, to Eric E. Walker, a tobacco smoke<br>
filter element is comprised of a resilient, water impervious elongated tubular casing<br>
having a porous plug of filtering material disposed in each end of said casing. Opposed,<br>
mutually spaced, disc-like walls are disposed within said casing between said plugs, one<br>
wall within said casing between said plugs and one wall abutting the inner surface of<br>
each plug. Said walls define a chamber within the central portion of said casing and<br>
have at least one port in each wall. The device further includes at least one liquid<br>
containing module disposed within said chamber and extending between said walls, and<br>
said walls have at least one passage for allowing smoke through said filter element.<br>
Means carried by said element and co-operating between said module and at least one<br>
port in each of said walls direct liquid from said module through ports into said plugs<br>
responsive to compression of the external walls of said chamber, so that said plugs may<br>
act selectively as a dry filter, or, when said casing is compressed, as a filter moistened<br>
by said liquid.<br>
In U.S. Patent No. 3,428,049 to Leake et al., one or more of said modules are<br>
surrounded by a compressed filter material in the element. When the module is<br>
compressed, the liquid saturates the filter material, causing it to expand into the space<br>
occupied by the module. It is made as part of the cigarette, confined to the filter.<br>
In U.S. Patent No. 3,635,226 to Horsewell et al., a liquid-containing capsule is<br>
disposed between an absorbent plug adjacent the tobacco and a non-absorbent plug,<br>
such that when the capsule is compressed the liquid is released into the absorbent plug.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 3,596,665 to Lundegard also describes a frangible, liquid-containing<br>
module disposed between two plugs. Compression of this module releases the liquid<br>
into both plugs for enhanced filtering.<br>
In addition, many different liquids have been encapsulated within the filter<br>
mechanism to moisten the filters. Examples thereof are water, glycerin, and aqueous<br>
solutions or emulsions containing aromatic flavouring agents. These liquids act, in the<br>
filter, primarily to cool the smoke and to facilitate condensation of volatile components<br>
therein on the filter substrate.<br>
The above mentioned filters describe smoke filters containing collapsible or<br>
frangible capsules filled with water or other liquids. Filter elements containing liquid<br>
pose a problem of retaining the liquid during storage, and those containing capsules or<br>
other containers of a liquid present within the filter structure cause a problem when the<br>
liquid is released, as the liquid holds the filter element in a collapsed state after pressure<br>
on the filter has been released.<br>
The aforementioned prior filters lack the desired versatility necessary for<br>
widespread acceptance.<br>
In the above mentioned products, the liquid products were incorporated inside<br>
the filter or made as an attachment to the filter.<br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 4,003,387,4,046,153 and 3,797,644 are directed to a disposable<br>
cigarette holder made of plastics, which has a wet cotton filter on the inside. The<br>
wetness is effected by glycerin and water. The holder is attached to the cigarette which<br>
draws smoke into and over the wet cotton filter, held together by plastics casing, into the<br>
mouth, which causes the tar and nicotine in the smoke (total particulate matter) to<br>
adhere onto the fibre wet filter. This product is thus an attachment. Most smokers object<br>
to having a foreign object, such as a holder made of plastics, in their mouth.<br>
As a practical matter, the processes of manufacturing and packaging cigarettes<br>
and the necessity for storing cigarettes for varying periods of time have proven to be<br>
affected because of damage/to filters, drying out, or impact or disfiguring of the filter<br>
with moisture before being smoked.<br>
Another example, in U.S. Patent No. 3,319,632 to Henry Burbig, relates to a<br>
cigarette moistener device. In this device, the interior of the filter tip of a cigarette is<br>
moistened. The device is topped by a receptacle and is provided with a hollow needle<br>
extending axially thereof, the needle having a number of openings in the side thereof<br>
and the hollow needle extending into the moistener container. Where the moistener<br>
container is a squeeze bottle with a resilient side, the insertion of the filter into the<br>
receptacle and squeezing the sides of the moistener container will result in impregnating<br>
the inner part of the filter with moisture. The utilization of a hollow needle of greatly<br>
restricted diameter will meter the amount of moisture thus expressed on a single<br>
squeeze, to impregnate the interior of the cigarette filter with water.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,158,099 describes a wet impact barrier filter medium for a<br>
smoking article wherein the wet impact barrier is coated across the end of the filter<br>
substantially transverse of the smoking article. The wet impact barrier is applied in<br>
sufficient amount so as to reduce tar and nicotine produced by the products of<br>
combustion.<br>
International Publication No. WO92/14371 corresponds to U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,240,015, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent No. 5,158,099, and relates to<br>
a wetted impact barrier which is separate and in no way attached to or bound to cigarette<br>
filters until the wetted impact barrier is physically applied to create a wetted impact<br>
barrier at the top end surface of the cigarette filter where the smoke is drawn into the<br>
mouth. The publication also describes a kit and a method of application of said kit to a<br>
cigarette in order to reduce the tar and nicotine inhaled by the cigarette smoker.<br>
Figures 1 to 4 of the present application correspond to Figures 2,8,9 and 5<br>
respectively of International Publication No. WO 92/14371. In particular, Figure 1<br>
shows the free end at the top of the filter of the cigarette showing a square type recess 12<br>
in the form of a well in the filter end face. The wetted surface designated by reference 13<br>
represents an impact barrier formed at the top surface of the filter by application of a<br>
quantity of liquid to the recess 12. Figure 2 illustrates a cross-shaped recess<br>
configuration 19 in the top surface 11 of the filter of a cigarette which is as yet untouched by any wet<br>
impact barrier. Figure 3 represents a further end view showing a cigarette before a wetted impact<br>
barrier is applied to the top surface 11 of the filter. A circular recess 27 is in this case provided in the<br>
top surface 11 of the filter. Figure 4 illustrates the impact-barrier forming kit described in<br>
International Publication WO 92/14371, said kit comprising a dispenser and instructions.<br>
In the device disclosed in International Publication WO 92/14371, barrier-forming liquid is<br>
inserted into the filter by making a hole in the end of the filter and squeezing a prescribed number of<br>
drops into the hole. A hole which is substantial in size relative to the size of the filter is gouged out.<br>
When the recess is charged with barrier-forming liquid, this spreads out through and soaks into the<br>
filter material at and adjacent to the end surface, to define the wet impact barrier. However, this can<br>
engender problems. For example, when the fluid is put into the filter, some users may taste the fluid,<br>
which in turn has an adverse effect on the efficiency of the smoking deterrent programme. Such a<br>
feature is not very encouraging for a user who intends to quit smoking.<br>
There is therefore a need for a more effective method for delivery of fluid to provide an<br>
impact barrier in a smoking article. The invention provides a method wherein the fluid is inserted<br>
into the side of the filter, preferably towards the base of the filter, near the tobacco, by piercing a<br>
small hole and injecting the fluid in from a cartridge or container. The barrier is thus established at a<br>
location spaced from or remote from the top or free end surface of the filter, which is received in the<br>
mouth. The aforesaid location, preferably within the filter, is referred to hereinafter as "a<br>
predetermined location", which will vary according to users" requirement. A diversity of further<br>
methods for establishing the barrier at a location remote from the free end face of the filter are<br>
provided by alternative embodiments of the invention.<br>
A number of cigarette/cigar treatment devices are known in which injection type techniques<br>
are applied. International Publication No. WO 81/03413 discloses a device for use by a smoker to<br>
introduce treatment fluids into a cigar, cigarette, charge of pipe tobacco, or similar consumer unit of<br>
smoking tobacco. A dispenser for the fluid is held in an outer casing, which also supports a receiver<br>
for the tobacco. An injection needle is disposed centrally within the receiver for dispensing the<br>
treatment fluid throughout the tobacco. A series of intercommunicating passages within the unit<br>
conduct the fluid from the dispenser to the needle upon actuation of the dispenser.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,269,203 discloses a device for injecting an unpleasant odoriferous<br>
substance into cigarettes contained within a package. The arrangement includes a hollow carrying<br>
case with an upper chamber for receiving a package of cigarettes and a lower chamber which<br>
contains the odoriferous substance. Hollow needles are arranged to extend from the lower chamber<br>
into the upper chamber for penetration into the cigarettes. The arrangement provides for the injection<br>
of the unpleasant substance into a multiplicity of cigarettes by a single injectior operation.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 3,732,872 provides an apparatus for uniformly distributing an additive<br>
solution throughout the length of a cigarette. A hinged block has a recessed cavity or cradle for<br>
holding a cigarette and is movably attached to one end of a track. A carriage provided with clamps<br>
for holding a syringe or additive reservoir is movably attached to the track in a position facing the<br>
hinged block. The syringe or reservoir has a needle and plunger. The carriage is moved forward so<br>
that syringe needle penetrates the length of the cigarette, with its tip positioned at the end of the<br>
cigarette opposite to that at which it entered. Injection of the additive solution is then effected.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,054,146 provides an arrangement for reducing the content of smoking bi-<br>
products, including nicotine and tar, and the smoke inhaled by a smoker. A perforator box is used to<br>
simultaneously perforate the paper covering the smoking end of all cigarettes in a pack. The full<br>
pack is placed in an open-sided box and a needle studded cover is pressed onto the box so that the<br>
needles perforate the cigarettes. When smoked, smoke from the perforated cigarettes contains a<br>
lower percentage of nicotine and tars. The needles serve to perforate only the side walls of the<br>
tobacco region of the cigarette. There is no perforation of the filter and neither is there is any<br>
injection of additive material.<br>
The prior art additive or fluid injection means described do not provide for specific placement<br>
of an additive substance in a specific region (being the predetermined location),of the smoking<br>
product, in particular the filter. The arrangements described are also particularly suited to the transfer<br>
of low viscosity substances and are not necessarily adapted for the convenient injection of more<br>
viscous or sticky type materials.<br>
In regard to the specific precise placement of an additive substance, the present invention<br>
thus also meets the requirement of providing a method of inserting a barrier fluid into a filter-<br>
tip so that the fluid is dispersed at a position in the filter sufficiently<br>
distant from the end of the cigarette which is put into the mouth of the user as will minimise the risk<br>
of the user tasting the fluid. Ease of application of barrier-forming fluid and minimisation of the risk<br>
of tasting the fluid are thus provided by the invention and encourage use of the related smoking<br>
termination programme and adherance thereto by users.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides for a device for providing a distributed zone of<br>
fluid in a filter of a smoking article comprising :<br>
(a) a container for a fluid, such as herein described, which forms a wet impact barrier when<br>
inserted into a smoking article, and<br>
(b) a delivery feature communicating between the container and an outlet of the delivery<br>
feature, for transfer of said fluid to the smoking article, wherein the delivery feature comprises at<br>
least in part a tube of significantly less diameter than the diameter of the smoking article, and the<br>
combination of container and delivery feature provides for placement of a substantially definable<br>
quantity of said fluid at a predetermined location within the smoking article,<br>
characterized in that at least a portion of a wall of the container is resilient and / or pliable to<br>
facilitate control of delivery of fluid from the container into the predetermined location within the<br>
filter.<br>
In a particular embodiment, the delivery feature of the device according to the invention<br>
comprises an injection needle. In an especially favoured construction, the injection needle is adapted<br>
for lateral injection of said fluid through a side wall of the filter. The fluid for providing the wetted<br>
impact barrier may contain syrup type solutions such as corn syrups, honey, glycol, petroleum jelly,<br>
mineral oil, maple syrup; any sugar based liquids such as all fruit syrups, gurgum; all food grade oils<br>
such as soyabean oil, corn oil, pectin, and all types of food grade gels. These fluids act, when applied<br>
physically by the user to a filter, primarily as a barrier. When the cigarette is smoked, the barrier is<br>
impacted on by the smoke, resulting in cooling of the smoke and condensation of volatile<br>
compounds. Because a syrupy type fluid is prone to dry out or harden within a narrow diameter<br>
passage such as an injection needle, in a preferred structure, the needle is a disposable unit mountable<br>
on the container for one-trip use. The one-trip needle may be either screwed onto or pushed onto an<br>
outlet portion of the container, which may be the neck of a small bottle.<br>
Control of delivery of fluid from the container may be facilitated by the<br>
construction of the container. Preferably, in the device according to the invention, at<br>
least a portion of a wall of the container is resilient and/or pliable. This feature enables<br>
the user to control the delivery of fluid into the needle and ultimately into the filter tip<br>
by applying suitable pressure on the exterior sides of the container in a regulated<br>
manner.<br>
A further embodiment of the device comprises at least one injection needle. The<br>
needle is selected to be of a suitable length and may be mounted on a syringe-type<br>
arrangement, preferably with gradations for metering purposes, so that the needle may<br>
be inserted through the base of the cigarette, up through the tobacco, and the fluid<br>
released into the base of the filter. This needle may also have a sheath extending<br>
alongside it, substantially the same in internal diameter as the external diameter of the<br>
cigarette. This arrangement allows the cigarette to be pushed down over the needle and<br>
injection action to take place, either independently using a syringe arrangement as in the<br>
previously described embodiment, or by virtue of the cigarette engaging some type of<br>
spring-biased fluid release feature. Advantages of these embodiments are the accurate<br>
placing of the fluid in the diametrical centre of the cigarette and the location of the fluid<br>
definitively and precisely at the base of the filter adjoining the tobacco by selection of an<br>
appropriate length of needle. Needles of different length may be provided for different<br>
sizes of cigarette.<br>
Thus the or each injection needle may be of sufficient axial extent for insertion<br>
from an end region of an elongate smoking article to extend axially within said smoking<br>
article to a region of said filter in the vicinity of a filter to tobacco boundary. The needle<br>
may be of sufficient axial extent for insertion from the tobacco end of the smoking<br>
article to extend into said region of the filter in the vicinity of the filter to tobacco<br>
boundary, or it may be of sufficient axial extent for insertion from the filter end of the<br>
smoking article to extend into said region of the filter in the vicinity of the filter to<br>
tobacco boundary. In either circumstance, stop means may be provided to delimit the<br>
extent of insertion of said injection needle.<br>
A further embodiment allows for top injection of the fluid, and comprises a<br>
number of very narrow, hollow pins, projecting within a sheath, the sheath being<br>
substantially the same in internal diameter as the external diameter of the cigarette. The<br>
container for the fluid is mounted on this applicator device and a metering valve<br>
communicates with a fluid dispensing feature. This feature suitably comprises a piston,<br>
displaceable within a cylinder, the pins being mounted on and extending from the<br>
displaceable piston. The filter tip end of the cigarette is pushed against the piston, which<br>
is spring-loaded, so that when the filter is pushed against the pin mounting piston, there<br>
is a measured amount of fluid dispensed into the filter. The advantages of this<br>
embodiment are the precise metering of the fluid and the even distribution of the fluid<br>
across the diameter of the filter at its base.<br>
Thus the device according to the invention may comprise a plurality of injection,<br>
needles. The delivery feature may further comprise a piston and cylinder type unit,<br>
control of delivery being achieved by displacement of a piston or plunger within a<br>
cylinder of the unit. Said cylinder may be provided with an external sheath to engage<br>
over the exterior of at least a portion of an elongate smoking article during application<br>
of the device to the smoking article and may also be provided with gradation marks to<br>
facilitate the dispensing of a substantially definable quantity of said fluid.<br>
The or each injection needle may extend from an end face of the cylinder, said<br>
end face defining a stop to delimit the extent of insertion of the injection needle(s) into a<br>
smoking article. Said piston or plunger may alternatively be spring-loaded and delivery<br>
of fluid is then achieved by engagement of an end face of the smoking article against<br>
said piston or plunger and displacement of the piston or plunger against the spring<br>
loading. In such an arrangement, the or each injection needle may thus extend directly<br>
from said piston or plunger, the face of the piston/plunger from which the needle(s)<br>
extend(s) defining a stop to delimit the extent of insertion of the injection needle(s) into<br>
a smoking article. A non-return valve may then be included for one-way flow of fluid<br>
from container to cylinder.<br>
A further possibility allows for a single pin at the top end, which may have an<br>
end fluid discharge opening combined with side openings, or side openings only. This<br>
means that the fluid injected through the needle is discharged out sideways at the end of<br>
the injection pin.<br>
A diversity of further embodiments are also feasible, combining the various<br>
features described above in a multiplicity of ways, viz. single or multiple needles,<br>
syringe or spring-loaded dispensers, and accurate metering.<br>
The device according to the invention allows a distributed zone of impact barrier fluid to be<br>
formed. The fluid forms a blocking zone in the filter, trapping the tar and nicotine formed upon<br>
combustion.<br>
The device of the present invention allows the fluid forming the wet impact barrier to be<br>
injected into the filter-tip at a location spaced from the end of the cigarette which the smoker puts in<br>
the mouth. The introduction of fluid at this position ensures that the fluid will not come into contact<br>
with the user"s lips, thereby decreasing the chance of the user tasting the liquid. In use, the device of<br>
the present invention enables the insertion of fluid into the filter without causing lateral crushing of<br>
the filter material. This manner of insertion ensures that there is less damage to the fibrous structure<br>
of the filter as compared with that of devices of the prior art.<br>
In the device according to the invention, the blocking fluid may comprise for example a corn<br>
syrup base, sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate, citric acid, water and colouring. The composition is<br>
such that it may be consumed as a food. It is not a drug composition and therefore use thereof has no<br>
risks or side-effects if inadvertently ingested.<br>
Use of the device according to the invention has shown that over 97% reduction of tars and<br>
nicotine delivery from a normal filtered cigarette when three drops of fluid are used. Use of the<br>
device according to the invention results in a reduced amount of nicotine reaching the lungs. The<br>
smoker is thus gradually "weaned" off the nicotine and is eventually able to give up smoking.<br>
The invention also encompasses a kit for providing a distributed zone of fluid in a filter of a<br>
smoking article comprising :<br>
(a) a container for a fluid which forms a wet impact barrier when inserted into a smoking<br>
article, and<br>
(b) a multiplicity of disposable delivery features for communicating between the container<br>
and an outlet of the delivery feature, for transfer of said fluid to the smoking article, each disposable<br>
delivery feature comprising at least in part a tube of significantly lesser diameter than the diameter of<br>
the smoking article and being mountable on the container for one-trip use for placement of a<br>
substantially definable quantity of said fluid at a pre-determined location within the smoking article,<br>
characterized in that at least a portion of a wall of the container is resilient and / or pliable to<br>
facilitate control of delivery of fluid from the container into the predetermined location into the filter.<br>
This aspect of the invention is especially suited to the circumstance where the<br>
fluid to be injected is a syrupy or hardened substance, for injection of which a one-trip<br>
or disposable delivery feature or injection needle is especially suited.<br>

Referring to Figure 5, the device according to the invention comprises a<br>
container 101 for holding a wet impact barrier forming fluid. The container 101 is<br>
provided with a delivery feature comprising an injection needle 102. The injection<br>
needle 102 may be inserted into the side wall of a filter tip 103 at a suitable location for<br>
transfer of the fluid into the filter tip 103 so as to form a wet impact barrier 104 (Figure<br>
6). The wall portions 105 of the container 101 are resilient/pliable, thereby allowing for<br>
expulsion of fluid contained therein and control of the quantity of fluid delivered by<br>
applying pressure to the exterior of the container 101. The extent of the pressure applied<br>
regulates the amount of fluid discharged, the rate of discharge and the quantity ejected<br>
into the filter-tip 103.<br>
The injection type arrangement of the present invention thus allows the barrier-<br>
forming fluid to be introduced laterally into the filter-tip 103 at a location spaced from<br>
the end 106 of the cigarette 107 which the smoker puts in the mouth. The fluid is<br>
introduced at a location sufficiently spaced from the mouth end 106 of the cigarette 107<br>
so that the wet barrier is not tasted by the smoker.<br>
Figure 6 shows an enlarged view of the filter 103 of a cigarette 107, in section in<br>
the region of the filter 103 where the barrier fluid is injected. Reference 108 indicates<br>
the aperture formed by the needle 102 in the side wall of the filter, tip 103 following<br>
injection of the barrier-forming fluid. The fluid, when injected, distributes itself through<br>
the filter-tip medium 103. The shading designated by reference 104 indicates the region<br>
where the barrier is located when said fluid has distributed itself. The fluid disperses<br>
through the material of the filter 103, forming a viscous barrier which traps the tar and<br>
nicotine produced by combustion.<br>
The injection needle 102 may be provided as a disposable unit for use in<br>
particular where the fluid is a sugary or syrupy type substance, prone to hardening<br>
within a needle feature following use, unless the needle is immediately rinsed out.<br>
Needle 102 is provided in a manner which allows it to be screwed onto a neck portion of<br>
the bottle 101 or pushed onto an opening at one end of the container. The disposable<br>
needle 102 is suitable for one-use or one-trip only and is discarded following the<br>
dispensing of the required amount of inhibiting fluid. In a kit for application of the<br>
invention, a single container 101 is provided with a multiplicity of attachments or needle<br>
fittings 102, mounted for example on a card backing. An individual needle 102 is<br>
detached from the card and applied to the neck of the container 101 either by screwing<br>
on or push-on, at the time of use. Each syringe portion or needle or tube 102 forms a<br>
bridge between the interior of the bottle and the interior of the filter when an injection<br>
operation is to be carried out. The needle is suitable for just one delivery of a quantity<br>
of fluid for insertion into the cigarette. Following use, it is removed from the container<br>
101 and discarded. A closure lid or cap is then reapplied to the container 101, to<br>
maintain the contents in good order. The syringe or needle feature 102 which is<br>
disposable is provided at relatively low cost as part of a multiple set of one-trip needles<br>
embodied in a kit which also includes the fluid container 101 and the fluid held within<br>
the container. In particular, a large number of needles can be mounted on a card for<br>
detachment as required at the time of use.<br>
Metering of an appropriate amount of barrier-forming fluid is of significance in<br>
the system according to the invention. The amount injected may comprise 1,2 or 3<br>
drops depending on the inhibiting effect to be developed. The embodiment described<br>
with respect to Figures 5 &amp; 6 provides only limited control over the quantity injected,<br>
because squeezing the sides of the pliable container 101 is to an extent a subjective I<br>
action and limits the extent of control over the size of each drop dispensed.<br>
An alternative embodiment illustrated in Figure 7 provides a number of<br>
advantages. As illustrated in Figure 7, the injection arrangement comprises a syringe<br>
type dispenser 114 having a cylinder 116 and a plunger or piston 118 displaceable<br>
within the cylinder. An elongate dispensing needle 110 extends from the base of the<br>
cylinder 120 remote from the plunger actuating portion or handle 124 and is of sufficient<br>
length so that when inserted from the tobacco end 112 of a cigarette 128, the open end<br>
of the injection needle is located substantially at the base 122 of the filter portion 126<br>
when the end face 112 of the cigarette 128 abuts the end face of the syringe 120 from<br>
which the needle extends. Injection may then take place by the user pushing in the<br>
actuating or handle end 124 of the plunger 118. Gradation marks 119 may be provided<br>
on the syringe arrangement, so that a precise amount of fluid may be dispensed by<br>
appropriately controlling the travel of the plunger 118. To facilitate this aspect of the<br>
dispensing arrangement, the cylindrical body of the syringe 116 may be transparent or<br>
provided with an appropriate window region. Other manners of gradation are however<br>
not excluded.<br>
Since the needle 110 is of suitable length, injection of the fluid then takes place<br>
into the base of the filter 122. In common with the arrangement of Figures 5 and 6, this<br>
placement of the fluid serves to minimise any taste from the fluid becoming apparent to<br>
the user during smoking. As compared with the arrangement of Figures 5 &amp; 6 however,<br>
the fluid is contained entirely inside the cigarette 128 and its filter portion 126. There is<br>
no possibility of any fluid coming onto the exterior of the filter 126, because there is no<br>
puncture in the side-wall of the filter. Selection qf an appropriate length of needle 110<br>
enables location of the fluid definitively and precisely at the base of the filter 122. The<br>
applicator or dispenser unit 114 has a potentially indefinite life span. The syringe-type<br>
unit 114 may be provided with needles 110 of different lengths to suit different sizes of<br>
cigarette 128. An appropriate length of needle 110 may be attached to the syringe 114<br>
depending on the size of the cigarette 128.<br>
In order to improve the precise substantially axial alignment of the needle 110 up<br>
through the elongate length of the tobacco portion 130 of a cigarette, the further<br>
arrangement of Figure 8 may be provided. In this case, a sheath 132 extends from the<br>
syringe, the sheath 132 being substantially the same in its internal diameter as the<br>
external diameter of the cigarette 130. The injector needle 138 is aligned substantially<br>
centrally within the sheath 132, i.e. coaxially with the cylindrical wall of the sheath 132.<br>
Thus in order to use the device in this embodiment, the cigarette 140 is pushed down<br>
inside the sheath 132 and over the needle 138. The needle 138 is thus constrained to<br>
assume an axial disposition within the cigarette 140, coaxial with the axis of the<br>
cigarette. Injection action may then take place in precisely the manner described in<br>
connection with Figure 7, with appropriate metering. Other alternative metering and<br>
dispensing features may also be provided in alternative constructions. Exact central<br>
placement of the inhibiting fluid within the filter tip 126 is facilitated by the centralising<br>
action of the sheath 132.<br>
In the variant of Figure 9, the possibility of top injection, through the filter tip<br>
itself from the end of the cigarette which is put in the mouth, is provided. An<br>
arrangement similar to an optic for dispensing a measured amount of an alcoholic drink<br>
is proposed. A number of hollow pins 142 of very narrow diameter extend from a<br>
piston 144, which is biased into a downward disposition within a sleeve or sheath 146<br>
defining a cylinder, by means of an internal spring 148. When the piston 144 is biased<br>
into its extended position, a non-return valve 150 allows entry of the inhibiting fluid<br>
from a container 152 communicating with the internal space above the piston 144,<br>
within the cylinder-form sheath 146.<br>
To insert the fluid, the filter tip of the cigarette is inserted into the sheath 146<br>
and the cigarette pushed up. The hollow pins 142 penetrate the filter tip to a location<br>
close to the filter/tobacco boundary. When the end face of the filter presses against the<br>
piston 144 portion of the unit, the piston 144 is displaced against the force of spring 148.<br>
The space within the cylinder 146 is thus reduced, and a measured amount of fluid is<br>
forced out of the cylinder 146, to be delivered through the dispensing needles 142 to the<br>
interior of the filter tip adjacent to the tobacco. The arrangement may be such that each<br>
displacement of the piston 144 of the applicator unit 154 delivers one drop of the<br>
inhibiting fluid. Multiple actions enable the dispensing of larger quantities of fluid in a<br>
precisely measured quantity. Advantages of the arrangement are precise metering and<br>
also even distribution of the fluid across the filter tip within its diameter.<br>
The single pin arrangement of Figures 7 &amp; 8 may be applied in the spring biased<br>
construction of Figure 9. Likewise, more than one needle may be used in the<br>
arrangement of Figures 7 &amp; 8, although this would most likely not be a preferred option<br>
for this construction. The arrangement of Figures 7 &amp; 8 may however also function<br>
with a spring biased metered piston arrangement similar to that shown in Figure 9, in a<br>
vertical orientation with the needle 110 or 138 directed downwardly.<br>
The active end of the injector needle, whether in the single pin arrangement or in<br>
a multi-pin structure, may also take a diversity of forms. It may for example be a simple<br>
open-ended needle. Alternatively, as shown in Figure 10, it may have a blanked-off end<br>
156 with distribution of fluid taking place through lateral apertures 158 in the side-walls<br>
of the needle.<br>
A further arrangement is shown in Figure 11, in which the end wall 156 is<br>
provided with an end face aperture 160 of small diameter, while radially-oriented lateral<br>
apertures 162 are also provided in the side wall. The needle end arrangements of<br>
Figures 10 &amp; 11 ensure an even and continuous distribution of the inhibiting liquid<br>
across a substantially planar region substantially defined within the end of the filter tip<br>
adjacent to the tobacco.<br>
Thus in summary, Figure 7 illustrates another embodiment of the device wherein<br>
injection needle 110 may be inserted into the tobacco end 112 of a cigarette so as to<br>
form a wet impact barrier. The container 114 is calibrated thereby allowing for control<br>
of the quantity of fluid delivered. This arrangement allows the barrier forming fluid to<br>
be introduced into the base of the filter 122. The fluid is introduced sufficiently spaced<br>
from the mouth end 117 of the cigarette so that the wet barrier is not tasted by the<br>
smoker.<br>
Figure 8 illustrates a similar arrangement where a sheath 132 extends up<br>
alongside the needle, substantially the same in internal diameter as the external diameter<br>
of the cigarette. This allows the cigarette 128 to be pushed down over the needle 110.<br>
Figure 9 shows an enlarged view of a top injector applicator where a number of<br>
pins 142 project within a sheath 146. The applicator in this form is pushed onto the filter<br>
end of the cigarette. The pins are mounted on a spring-loaded piston 144, so that when<br>
the filter is pushed against the pin mounting or piston 144, a measured amount of fluid<br>
is delivered. A metering valve 150 allows one-way flow of fluid from a storage<br>
container 152 to the dispensing piston of the applicator.<br>
Figures 10 and 11 show further possibilities for top injection. Figure 10 shows a<br>
pin with side openings 158 only whereas Figure 11 shows a pin with an end opening 160<br>
combined with side openings 162.<br>
In all injector-type embodiments, injector needle diameter and other dimensions<br>
are matched to the flow and viscosity characteristic of the liquid. In the embodiments in<br>
which the injector needle or needles are downwardly directed, outflow of liquid may be<br>
curtailed except under piston action by sizing the needle parameters for capillary<br>
restraint of unwanted or uncontrolled discharge of liquid.<br>
It will be further appreciated that where the characteristics of the liquid render it<br>
prone to solidification or hardening within a needle type injection feature, either a one-<br>
trip or disposable type needle may be used, or alternatively, it is necessary for the user to<br>
cleanse or flush out the needle immediately after use. In order therefore to maintain in<br>
good order an arrangement according to the invention intended for repeated use, a<br>
maintenance step is required following each dispensing operation. It is necessary for the<br>
injection needle to be rinsed out where the fluid used has characteristics rendering it<br>
prone to clog the needle unless this flushing or rinsing step is completed.<br>
The words "comprises/comprising" and the words "having/including" when<br>
used herein with reference to the present invention are used to specify the presence of<br>
stated features, integers, steps or components but does not preclude the presence or<br>
addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, components or groups thereof.<br>
