				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a metallic card clothing for rollers of a carding machine.<br>
In a carding machine, metallic card clothing is wound spirally on to the main cylinder and doffer cylinder in a closely abutting manner.   The metallic card clothing acting with flexible card clothing located on the flats of a carding machine facilitates fibre individualization.<br><br>
The card clothing used with the rollers of the carding machine comprises a base portion and a blade portion having   teeth.    In the metallic card clothing used in. practice till now, the same spacing is provided between the adjacent teeth (pitch) and .the width of the lands are equal. A metallic card clothing of this conventional type is shown in figure 1.<br>
A metallic card clothing having a variable pitch which increases continuously and then decreases continuously is also known in the art. A process and apparatus for manufacturing this type of metallic card clothing is disclosed in US Patent No. 6,195,843.<br>
While processing synthetic and blend materials in a carding machine the sharp profile of the teeth of the metallic card clothing leads to fibre rupture and inferior parallelisation of fibre. A further drawback of the known card clothing is that due to the continued feeding of the synthetic fibres at the higher production rate, loading of fibre occurs at the tips of the teeth of the metallic card clothing on the main cylinder and these fibres are pressed down on to the area of blade portion of the metallic card clothing. This causes damage to the metallic card clothing apart from fibre rupture.<br>
While processing cotton, the sharp profile of the teeth of the metallic card clothing, pulverizes cotton seeds during the    carding action and the broken seed panicles mingle with fibre which are not completely extracted by the revolving flat tops. This will result in inferior fabric quality.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a   metallic card clothing,<br>
which reduces fibre rupture and fibre loading on clothed rollers of the carding machine.   The invention provides a metallic card clothing with the  spacing between the adjacent teeth different along the length of the card clothing and the width of the lands of the successive teeth different from each other.   By providing an effectively<br>
larger width of the lands by randomization of its width, the  pulverization of cotton<br>
seeds are considerably reduced, resulting in fibre with less of broken seed particles in<br>
the end product. Further, such an arrangement of the teeth in a card clothing provides better results during carding operation.<br>
	Accordingly, the present invention provides a metallic card clothing for rollers<br>
of a carding machine comprising a base portion and a blade portion having teeth with lands, characterized in that the spacing between the adjacent teeth (pitch) and the width of the lands vary randomly along the length of the blade portion.<br>
The variation in the pitch of the teeth and the width of the lands at any point<br>
increases or decreases within the given range along the length of the blade.  Normal pitch variation for  the product is 1mm  to 3mm and the land is 0.05 mm to 2 mm. The length of each cycle may be preferably kept in the range of 30 to 8000 mm. The variation is effected by speeding up or slowing down the material feed with help of<br>
electronic speed control.   The speed control ensures that there is  no periodicity and<br>
the starting speed can be anything within the range and thus the pattern    is not  repeated along the length of the blade.  The speed control keeps the trough length the  same and base width of the teeth is varied. The variation is repeated and is adjustable from 30 mm to 8000 mm.<br><br>
The invention will now be described with reference to the    accompanying ' drawings.<br><br>
Figures 1 and 2 show the metallic card clothing according to the prior art.<br>
Figures 3 and 4 show the metallic card clothing having variable pitch with : variable land in sequence.<br><br>
Figures 5 and 6 show the   metallic card clothing according to the present<br>
invention having variable pitch with variable land in random with equal trough.<br><br>
Figures 7 and 8 show the   metallic card clothing according to the present invention having variable pitch with variable land in random with unequal trough.<br>
The metallic card clothing comprises a base portion (1) and a blade portion (2) I has the teeth. In the metallic card clothing used in the prior art shown in figures 1 and ; 1, the pitch (P) between adjacent teeth in the blade portion (2) and the width of lands (L) of the teeth are constant. In another embodiment of conventional card clothing, I the pitch of the teeth is varied in sequence as shown in figures 3 and 4.     In the<br>
metallic card clothing  according to the invention shown in figures 5 to 8, the pitch (P1, P2	Pn) of the teeth in the blade portion (2) and the width of the lands (L1, L2... .Ln) vary randomly along the length of the card wire. The thickness (t) of the blade I portion (2) of the  card clothing and the thickness (T) of the base portion (1) of the<br>
card clothing are kept uniform. Similarly, the height (Hi) of the base portion (1) and ' the total height (H) (fig. 2, 4, 6, 8) of the card clothing are also kept uniform. In a , typical card clothing the width of the land of the teeth varies from 0.05mm to 2mm for ! individual wires.	The card clothing of the present invention could be made with equal trough as well as unequal trough.<br>
The geometry of the metallic card clothing according to the invention reduces the<br>
pulverization of seed bits and fibre during carding.  It also reduces fibre loading of clothed<br>
rollers while processing fibre and therefore higher production rate are achieved by using it. When the metallic card clothing according to the invention is mounted on the rollers of the<br>
carding machine, the wire points per unit are in random manner.  This facilitates optimum opening of the fibre and breaks the air vortices caused by the air currents because the random structure do not contribute to the vortex formation. This helps to avoid accumulation of fibre clusters and thus reduces neps.<br>
The metallic card clothing according to the invention is preferably made of / carbon steel / alloy steel and hardened.<br>
A comparative performance of a card clothing according to the present invention was made with reference to the card clothing used in the prior art and the results are given below :<br>
