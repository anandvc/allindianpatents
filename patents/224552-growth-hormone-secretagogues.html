The Patents Act, 1970 (39 of 1970)<br>
1.	"APPARATUS AND METHOD OF CONDITIONING SCALE ON A METAL SURFACE"<br>
2(a)      KOLENE CORPORATION<br>
(b)	12890 Westwood Avenue, Detroit, Michigan 48223, United States of America<br>
(c)	United States of America<br>
The following specification describes the nature of this invention.and the manner<br>
in which it is to be performed<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
nozzles, one of which is shown at 2i, to spray the top surface of the a strip l3. and a  set of lower nozzles, one of which if shown at 30, to spray the lower surface of the strip 13. A second or backup set of spray nozzles including upper nozzles, one of which is shown at 34, and lower nozzles, one of which is shown at 36, may optionally be added to insure coverage if necessary, as will  be described presently. (Of course, only one set of nozzles may be needed in some cases, or more than two sets of nozzles may be required in some cases, depending on the speed and width of the strip 13 and other factors.) The nozzles 28,30,34, and 36* are of a type that can receive liquid and spray the liquid as very fine atomized droplets onto (he strip of steel 13. The nozzles can be Air Atomizing type VAU as supplied by Spraying Systems Co. While an air atomizing nozzle is described, other spray forming techniques that provide adequate atomizau'on / small droplet size, such as high pressure hydraulic nozzles, may also be used effectively. Specialized techniques such as electrostatic deposition may be used to enhance transfer efficiency.  A rinse section 38, shown in dotted outline, is provided adjacent the spray section 24. This rinse can optionally be either of the spray type or immersion type. In the immersion type, rinse is carried out by passing the strip under a rubber immersion roll submerged in a water rinsing tank, and in the spray type, rinsing is carried but by the strip passing through an array of water spray nozzles being supplied with fresh water, or by a pump from a collection sump located below the spray area. A surface analyzer 42 is optionally provided adjacent the nozzles 28 that will monitor the surfaces of the strip to detect lack of conditioning. This analyzer 42 may be an infrared linescan system or other machine vision system. One suitable infrared system is Landscan supplied by Lan Instruments International Inc. The analyzer provides input to the line dynamics operating system that will be described presently.<br>
Following the rinse section, the strip is guided by a set of conventional tracking and bridle roils 44. This set of rolls 44 will keep the strip on track and maintain proper tension in the strip. The strip of steel 13 typically then goes to an acid pickling section. Acid pickling usually includes one or more acid tanks, although acid spray could be used. Multiple acid pickles may be required on some grades of stainless steel, as illustrated at 48,50 and 52. Rinse tanks 49,51 and 53 are provided following pickle tanks 48,50 and 52, respectively. Typically, the tank 48 contains sulfuric acid, tanks 50 and 52 contain either a mixture of nitric acid and hydrofluoric acid or nitric acid. One or more of these may be used on any given strip 13 of stainless steel depending on many factors, including the composition of the steel, the thickness of the oxide, and other factors known in the art In addition, other acids and mixtures of acids may be used, which also is well known in the art<br>
Following emergence of the strip 13 from the acid pickle and rinse, the strip is recoiled on recoiler 54. At this point, all of the scale conditioning and pickling has been completed<br><br><br><br>
The liquid scale conditioning solution sprayed on the strip 13 by the nozzles 21,30,34, end 36 is supplied thereto from one or more liquid product storage vessels 56,58, and 60 having temperature sensors 57,59 and 61, respectively. The reason for several vessels is to store different solutions that may be required or desirable for different grades of steel and/or storing additives to the base solution that can be mixed in-line to provide the desired composition, all as will be described presently. The vessels 56,58, and 60 are provided with discharge pumps 62,64, and 66, respectively, to pump liquid from their respective storage vessel. At the output side of the pumps 62,64, and 66 are flow controllers 68,70 and 72, respectively. (It is to be understood that it is possible to use metering-type variable flow pumps 62,64, and 66 and thus combine the metering and flow regulating functions in a single unit, eliminating the need for flow controllers, although flow meters may be desired.) From the flow controllers 68,70, and 71, the liquid is delivered to nozzle supply line 74 which contains an in-line mixer 76 to assure complete mixing of product delivered from two or more storage vessels 56,58, and 60. Lines 80,82,84 and 86 supply the nozzles 28,30, 34 and 36, respectively, with the liquid product that is to be sprayed, on the strip 13, and flow sensors 87,88,89 and 90 and metering valves 92,94, % and 98 are provided in the lines 80,82,84 and 86, respectively, to monitor and control the flow to each spray nozzle 28,30,34 and 36, respectively. Another way of utilizing multiple storage vessels is to use one vessel with a concentrated feedstock that might not allow some additives to be in solution with it, and a second vessel containing the additive(s). The first vessel would feed a first array of nozzles, and the second vessel would feed a second, downstream array of nozzles. This would be used where in-line mixing would not be feasible or desirable because of solubility limitations, ion-exchange, precipitation, or other untoward results of in-line mixing of concentrated solutions, eg, nozzle blockages, filter blinding, etc.<br>
The system controls include a line dynamics operating system 112 which receives operating line system inputs, and outputs line variables 114 to operate the annealing line, as' will be'described presently. There is also provided a scale conditioning process control system 120 which receives as control variables outputs from the line dynamics operating system 112.<br>
Before describing the operation of the line in detail, a description of the method of the present invention will be given. According to one embodiment of this invention, an aqueous solution containing an alkali metal hydroxide is sprayed In the form of droplets onto a strip of stainless steel or other metal, with the strip being held at a temperature above the melting point of the essentially anhydrous form of the material in solution and below that at which the Leidenfrost effect appears. As used herein, the term "essentially anhydrous form of the material" means after the water of solution is evaporated, even though there may be some water of hydration still present<br><br><br><br>
in the material. As used herein, the term "Leidenfrost effect on the strip" is a mottled or speckled surface appearance of the strip, which reveals patches, or spots of incomplete scale conditioning. This is believed to be due to the Lidcafrost effect on the aqueous solution of chemicals if the strip is above what is known as the Leidenfrost temperature or Leidenfrost point of the solution being sprayed. When the strip is above the Leidenfrost temperature of the solution being sprayed, a thin film of the sprayed liquid is converted to a vapor phase barrier between die metal surface and the droplet, preventing the droplet from contacting the surface of the strip and depositing the chemicals on the metal surface upon evaporation of the liquid. The Leidenfrost effect is well known and described in many publications. Two such publications are; "Disk Model of the Dynamic Leidenfrost Phenomenon" (Martin Rein at DFD96 meeting of American Physical Society) and "Miracle Mongers and Their Methods" (pages 122-124 by Harry Houdini, published 1920 by E. P. Dutton).<br>
Figure 2 is a photograph of the surface of a type 304 stainless steel sample that does not show the Leidenfrost effect after a treatment according to this invention, which treatment will be described presently; Figures 3-5 are photographs of the surfaces of type 304 stainless steel samples that show the Leidenfrost effect to various degrees after scale conditioning (Figure S being the worst) outside the scope of the present invention and pickling, also as will be described presently. It should be noted that with respect to Figures 3-5, there are areas where the scale conditioning is complete, i.e. the white or gray areas, as well as areas where there is incomplete scale conditioning, i.e. the dark areas. This indicates that some of the droplets exhibited die Leidenfrost effect, i.e. where the dark spots appear, and some of the drops of solution either did not experience or overcame the Leidenfrost effect and, thus, were effective for scale conditioning, i.e. the white or bright areas. Thus, as used herein, the term "a temperature below which the Leidenfrost effect appears" refers to a temperature at which no appreciable scale in the form of dark spots exists after scale conditioning according to this invention and subsequent picklingThe surface as shown in Figure 2 is an example" of a temperature at which no Liedenfrost effect is present, and Figures 3-5 are examples of temperatures at which the Leidenfrost effect is present<br>
The samples of Figures 2-5 as well as other samples were prepared and treated as follows: The samples were 4 inch x 6 inch panels of 0.025 inch gage type 304 stainless steel. Each sample was heated to a temperature of about 1950 °F in air and then removed and clamped in a test fixture The samples were cooled to a predetermined temperature as measured by a contact thermocouple. The samples were then sprayed with an aqueous alkali hydroxide-containing solution, rinsed with water and then acid pickled. Table 1 below sets out the values for the variables used for the different samples and the descaling results.<br><br><br>
