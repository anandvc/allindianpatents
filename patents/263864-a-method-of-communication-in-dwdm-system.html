				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a DWDM-3240 system is Dense wavelength division multiplexing of optical transmission system. The present invention preferably relates to a method and system for communicating a given input signal by converting the signal into a predetermined colored DWDM wavelength, and apparatus thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The explosion in demand for network bandwidth is largely due to the growth in data traffic, specifically Internet Protocol (IP). Leading service providers report bandwidths doubling on their backbones about every six to nine months. This is largely in response to the 300 percent growth per year in Internet traffic, while traditional voice traffic grows at a compound annual rate of only about 13 percent.<br>
At the same time that network traffic volume is increasing, the nature of the traffic itself is becoming more complex. Traffic carried on a backbone can originate as circuit based (fDM voice and fax), packet based (IP), or cell based (ATM and Frame Relay). In addition, there is an increasing proportion of delay sensifive data, such as voice over IP and streaming video.<br>
In response to this explosive growth in bandwidth demand, along with the emergence of IP as the common foundation for all services, long-haul service providers are moving away from TDM based systems, which were optimized for voice but now prove to be costly and inefficient. Meanwhile, metropolitan networks are also experiencing the impact of growing congestion, as well as rapidly changing requirements that call for simpler and faster provisioning than is possible with older equipment and technologies. In this approach, many wavelengths are combined onto a single fiber. Using wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technology several wavelengths, or light colors, can simultaneously mulfiplex signals of 2.5 to 40 Gbps each over a strand of fiber. Without having to lay new fiber, the effective capacity of existing fiber plant can routinely be increased by a factor of 16 or 40. Systems with 128 and 160 wavelengths are in operation today, with higher density on the horizon. The specific limits of this technology are not yet known.<br><br>
While Debate Continues as to Whether WDM or TDM is More Suitable for the [expansion of the Existing Fiber Network, it has become clear that Only Solutions, Which are Incorporating Both Technologies (as in WCC Card, which is doing TDM for Lower Data-rate) will Give Service Provider the Flexibility and Capacity for Future Requirements. These Requirements could, for Example Enable them to:<br>
•	Maintain Different Dedicated Wavelengths for Different Customer<br>
•	Lease Individual Wavelengths as Opposed to Entire Fibers<br>
•	1 Expand  Portions of their Networks (for  Example, where Multiple  Rings Intersect Between Two Nodes)<br>
•	Integrate Both Voice and Data Services into Different Transportation Frame before Lransporting Over a DWDM Channel<br>
The 32-channel Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) Equipment for Channel Bit-rates upto STM-16 (2.5Gb/s)/OTU-l (2.7Gb/s) allows expanding the capacity of the Network without laying more Fibers. It can Multiplex 32 of STM-16 (2.5Gb/s)/OTU-l (2.7Gb/s) optical signals on a existing single mode (G.652) fiber, Thus increasing the carrying capacity of the single fiber from 2.5Gb/s to 80Gb/s. The DWDM-3240 Equipment conforms to International Telecommunication Union, fclecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) Recommendations. The other Special features of this equipment include forward error correction (FEC), Mapping of 2 1 -Gigabit Ethernet signals onto one STM-16 stream, and Tunable transponder card within the specified C-Band (1530nm to 1565nm) of optical.<br>
The traditional fiber communication is point to point; a single wavelength transmission used a separate fibre. With the growing demand of bandwidth it is unable to meet the requirement. The DWDM-3240 is enabling service providers to accommodate consumer demand for ever-increasing amounts of bandwidth on a same single fibre. DWDM increases the capacity of embedded fibre by first assigning incoming optical signals to specific frequencies (wavelength, lambda) within a designated frequency band and then multiplexing the resulting signals out onto one fiber. Because incoming signals are never<br><br>
terminated in the optical layer, the interface can be bit-rate and format independent, allowing the service provider to integrate DWDM technology easily with existing equipment in the network while gaining access to the untapped capacity in the embedded fiber.<br>
Use of DWDM allows providers to offer services such as e-mail, video, and multimedia carried as Internet protocol (IP) data over asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) and voice carried over SONET/SDH. Despite the facts that these format—IP, ATM, and SONET/SDII provide unique bandwidth management capabilities; all three can be transported over the optical layer using DWDM. This unifying capability allows the service provider the flexibility to respond to customer demands over one network.<br>

With the phenomenal growth in the demand for more and more Bandwidth, Telecom Operators world over are looking for options to increase the Bandwidth using the existing infrastructure (fiber) and are eager to protect the investments already made.<br>
Dense Wave Division Multiplexing technology is the latest development in the Telecom Transport Systems in the Optical Domain and answers most of the concerns of Operators.<br>
fhe DWDM-3240 system is a Dense Wavelength Division MuKiplexing of optical transmission system that supports up to 40 wavelengths as per FfU-T Grid wavelengths. . System can be smoothly configured as per Customer requirements for transmission capacities of lOGb/s, 20Gb/s, 40Gb/s and lOOGb/s. The system can be configured for short haul, Long haul &amp; very long Haul applications.<br><br>
The DWDM-3240 system is a DWDM optical transmission system that supports up to 40 wavelengths and the maximum transmission capacity of up to 80Gb/s. The selection and separation of wavelengths is in strict compliance with the ITU-T Recommendations. The actual system configuration capacity can be selected flexibly according to customer's requirements, hence meeting requirements for transmission capacities of lOGb/s, 20Gb/s, and 40Gb/s and up to 80Gb/s. The system can also be equipped with Wavelength Line Amplifier so that the maximum non-relay transmission distance can be more than 640km. figure 1 shows Application diagram of the DWDM Long-haul (LH) with point-to-point topology, 'fhe LH equipment acquire 640 kms approximately route length before acquiring 3R regeneration. This is based on 0.28db/km loss over single mode fiber ITU-T G.652. Span loss between MPI-S &amp; R', S' &amp; MPl-R and S' &amp; R' reference points for all spans is 22db or more. There could be 8 such spans or more with 80 kms each span.<br>
The U'fL DWDM-3240 optical transmission system is of two types, the integrated type and the open type. The integrated system can directly access the SDH equipment that satisfies the requirements for optical interfaces as suggested in the ffU-T G.692 Recommendation. This system is simple in structure and low in cost, 'fhe open system provides wavelength conversion function. Service providers can use it to expand relay distances and capacities of SDH transmission equipment of all vendors if the equipment satisfies the ITU-T G.957 Recommendation for optical interfaces. Therefore, the open system offers very good compatibility.<br>

The Card Provide Required Transmission Related Alarms, and Performances for all Supported Client and Line Optical Signals, and other Transmission Parameters.<br>
Based on the Required Client Signal Mapping &amp; Multiplexing, there are Two Types of WCC Card been designed.<br>
Type I: FEC Transponder<br>
Figure 2 shows FEC Transponder Card. This transponder can map one STM-16 (2.5Gb/s) optical client stream to OTU-1 (2.7Gb/s) frame format and transport via an optical wavelength in the DWDM grid as per ITU-T Rec. G.694.1. The DWDM line signal is OTU-1 laDl (Intra-domain Interface) including FEC as per ITU-T Rec. G.709. The same card be configured for STM-4 (622Mb/s) and GigE (1.25Gb/s) optical client. Ihe STM-4 client will be mapped to Sub-rate OTU (666Mb/s) and transport via an optical wavelength in the DWDM grid. The GigE Client will be transported transparently over an optical wavelength in the DWDM grid. The STM-16 and STM-4 clients can also be regenerated and transmitted on the line side as STM-16 and STM-4 respectively.<br>
■fhis Card Supports STM-4, STM-16, and GigE Grey Clients, and can Map them onto an OfU Frame as per ITU-T Rec. G.709, or Transparently Transmit them, after Performing 3R Functionality. This Signal is Further Mapped onto a Colored DWDM Wavelength and Transmitted towards the Mux/De-mux and Vice-versa. Multiplexing of the Client Signals are not Provided on this Card. Transponder card receive optical STM-16, STM-4, or CjigE client and convert them into electrical signal, this serial data output is de-serializcd and given to the framer/mapper device which then maps the client signal to a output<br><br>
signal based on the selected configuration, the output of the tramer/mapper device is serialized and the resulting electrical signal is then converted into a DWDM grid optical wavelength to the multiplexer unit<br>
Type-Il: SDH &amp; GigE Muxponder<br>
This Card Supports Two Numbers of STM-4 and/or GigH Grey Clients, and can Map and/or Multiplex them onto an STM-16 Frame. In Case of Two GigE Client Signals, they arc Mapped into Generic Framing Procedure (GFP-F) as per ITU-T Rec. G.7041, and VCAT Individually, the Resulting Signals are then Multiplexed into STM-16. In Case of Two SrM-4 Client Signals they are Straight Multiplexed into STM-16. This Card can also be Configured for One GigH Client, and another as STM-4 Client, and Multiplex then onto STM-16, after their Respective Mapping. This STM-16 Signal is Further Mapped onto a Colored DWDM Wavelength and Transmitted towards the Mux/Dc-mux and Vice-versa. Muxponder card receives two optical STM-4, or GigE or combination of both client and convert them into electrical signal, this serial data output is de-serialized and given to the framer/mapper device which then maps the client signal into multiple VC and multiplex then into a STM-16 stream, the output of the framer/mapper device is serialized and the resulting electrical signal is then converted into a DWDM grid optical wavelength to the multiplexer unit.<br>
Figure 3 shows GbE Muxponder Card. This type of Muxponder multiplex two GigE optical client onto STM-16 through GFP-F, and VCAT, and transported via a 2.5G optical wavelength in the DWDM grid as per ITU-T Rec. G.694.1. In the receive side the S'fM-16 data carrying GigE payloads demuxed/demapped two streams of GigE and presented back to the client interfaces.<br>
fransponder: These Cards Take Client Input, If Require Map then In a Different Format and Further Convert then into a Particular Wavelength<br>
Muxponder: fhese Cards Apart from Mapping and Framing, Can also Multiplex Client Signal into Higher Order<br>
FEC Transponder Card<br><br><br>
Ingiire 4 shows the optical wavelength conversion process, in transmit direction where a grey SDH optical client at 1550nm is received by the receiving module and converted into electrical signal, this electrical signal is further converted back into optical signal but with DWDM grid wavelength. Similarly in receive direction the DWDM grid wavelength is converted into electrical signal by the receiving module and further into a 1550nm grey wavelength to the transmitting module. Both the receiving and the transmitting module is monitored for various alarm and performance parameter and reported to SCC (system control card.<br>
Ingurc 5 is the internal block of the OTN framer/mapper device of the transponder card. In the transmit path the optical client signal (STM-16, STM-4, or GigE) after converting lo electrical, and de-serializing is received through the east receive interface, and based on the input client type (SDH or Ethernet) it is passed to east GbE and FC monitor or east SONET monitor block, these blocks monitor the client data signals for error and performance by reading their overhead information based on the client protocol. Further the overhead information are regenerated by the east generator blocks and the resulting signal is given to the OTN frame generator, which creates the OTU frame including the FEC and sends out through east transmit interface, to the serializer device. In the receive direction the OCh processor checks the FEC for correction in the received signal, and monitor the alarm and performance by reading the overhead information, further the client signal is demapped by this block and based on the client data type passed to either<br><br>
west GbF: and FC monitor or west SONET monitor block. The overhead information are regenerated and presented to the west transmit interface.)<br>

These GPF frames are put onto multiple payload containers and virtually concatenated by the VCAT block, fhese virtual containers are then TDM multiplexed to create higher order tributaries, and they are fmally mapped onto a STM-16 frame by the LTE block.)<br>
