				<td>A SOLID LAUNDRY DETERGENT COMPOSITION COMPRISING ANIONIC DETERSIVE SURFACTANT AND A CALCIUM-AUGMENTED TECHNOLOGY<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to solid laundry detergent compositions comprising anionic detersive surfactant and a calcium augmented technology. The compositions of the present invention have good dispensing and dissolution profiles and an excellent cleaning performance.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
There have been relatively recent attempts by many detergent manufacturers to significantly improve the dissolution and dispensing performance of their granular laundry detergents. The approach many detergent manufacturers have focused on is the significant reduction in the level of, or even the complete removal of, water-insoluble builder, such as zeolite builder, in/from their granular laundry detergent formulations. However, due to the phosphate-usage avoidance legislation in many countries which prevents the detergent manufacturers from incorporating a sufficient amount of phosphate-based water-soluble builders, such as sodium tripolyphosphate, in their granular laundry detergents, and due to the lack of feasible alternative non-phosphate based water-soluble builders available to the detergent manufacturers, the approach many detergent manufacturers have focused on is to not completely replace the zeolite-based builder system with a water-soluble builder system having an equivalent degree of builder capability, but instead to formulate an under-built granular laundry detergent composition.<br>
Whilst this under-built approach does significantly improve the dissolution and dispensing performance of the granular laundry detergent, problems do exist due to the significant amount of cations, such as calcium, that are not removed from the wash liquor by the builder-system of the granular laundry detergent composition during the laundering process. These cations interfere with the anionic detersive surfactant system of the granular laundry detergent composition in such a manner as to cause the anionic detersive<br><br>
surfactant to precipitate out of solution, which leads to a reduction in the anionic detersive surfactant activity and cleaning performance. In extreme cases, these water-insoluble complexes may deposit onto the fabric resulting in poor whiteness maintenance and poor fabric integrity benefits. This is especially problematic when the laundry detergent is used in hard-water washing conditions when there is a high concentration of calcium cations.<br>
The Inventors have found that the cleaning performance of under-built detergent compositions is improved by using an anionic detersive surfactant in combination with a calcium-augmented technology.<br>
US 5,552,078 by Carr ct al, Church &amp; Dwight Co. Inc., relates to a powdered laundry detergent composition comprising an active surfactant. It is alleged that compositions of US 5,552,078 exhibit excellent cleaning and whitening of fabrics whilst avoiding the problem of eulrophication which occurs when a substantial amount of phosphate-builder is present in the composition, and while minimizing the problem of fabric-encrustation often present when the composition contains a large amount of carbonate builder.<br>
US 6,274,545 Bl by Mazzola, Church &amp; Dwight Co. Inc., relates to a high-carbonate low-phosphate powder laundry detergent formulation which can allegedly be utilized in cold water fabric laundering with a minimized remainder of undissolvcd detergent residue in the wash liquor. The detergent composition of US 6,274,545 Bl comprises an anionic/nonionic surfactant blend that is a partially sulphatcd and neutralized ethoxylated alcohol surfactant, and a polyethylene glycol ingredient, which allegedly increases the solubility of the laundry detergent solids in the wash liquor.<br>
WO97/43366 by Askew et al, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company, relates to a detergent composition that comprises an effervescence system. WO97/43366 exemplifies a carbonate built bleach-free detergent composition.<br>
WOOO/18873 by Hartshorn et al, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company, relates to detergent compositions having allegedly good dispensing performance and allegedly do not leave residues on the fabric after the laundering process.<br>
WOOO/18859 by Hartshorn ct al, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company, relates to detergent compositions allegedly having an improved delivery of ingredients into the wash liquor during the laundering process. The compositions of WOOO/18859 allegedly<br><br>
do nol as readily gel upon contact with water and allegedly do not leave water-insoluble residues on clothes after the laundering process. The compositions of WOOO/18859 comprise a predominantly water-soluble builder system that is intimately mixed with a surfactant system.<br>
WO02/053691 by Van der Hoeven el al, Hindustain Lever Limited, relates to a laundry detergent composition comprising greater than 10wt% of a calcium tolerant surfactant, from 0.1 wt% to 10wt% of a strong builder system selected from phosphate builders and/or zeolite builders, and less than 35wt% of non-functional non-alkaline water-soluble inorganic salts.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a solid laundry detergent composition in particulate form, comprising: (a) anionic detersive surfactant; (b) a calcium-augmented technology; (c) from 0% to less than 5%, by weight of the composition, of zeolite builder; (d) from 0% to less than 5%, by weight of the composition, of phosphate builder and (c) optionally, from 0% to less than 5%, by weight of the composition, of silicate salt.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Solid laundry detergent composition<br>
The composition comprises anionic detersive surfactant, a calcium augmented technology, from 0 to less than 5%, by weight of the composition, of zeolite builder, from 0% to less than 5%, by weight of the composition, of phosphate builder, and optionally from 0% to less than 5%, by weight of the composition, of silicate salt. The composition may comprise other adjunct components. Whilst the composition may comprise silicate salt at levels of 5wt% or greater, preferably the composition comprises from 0% to less than 5%, by weight of the composition, of silicate salt.<br>
The composition is in particulate form, such as an agglomerate, a spray-dried power, an extrudate, a flake, a needle, a noodle, a bead, or any combination thereof. The composition may be in compacted-particulate form, such as in the form of a tablet. The<br><br>
composition may be in some other unit dose form, such as a pouch, typically being at least partially, preferably completely, enclosed by a water-soluble film such as polyvinyl alcohol. Preferably, the composition is in free-flowing particulale form; by free-flowing paniculate form, it is typically meant that the composition is in the form of separate discrete particles. The composition may be made by any suitable method including agglomeration, spray-drying, extrusion, mixing, dry-mixing, liquid spray-on, roller compaction, sphcronisation or any combination (hereof.<br>
The composition typically has a bulk density of from 450g/l to l,000g/l, preferred low bulk density detergent compositions have a bulk density of from 550g/l to 650g/l and preferred high bulk density detergent compositions have a bulk density of from 750g/l to 900g/l.<br>
During the laundering process, the composition is typically contacted with water to form a wash liquor having a pH of from above 7 to less than 13, preferably from above 7 to less than 10.5. This is the optimal pH to provide good cleaning whilst also ensuring a good fabric care profile.<br>
The composition typically has an equilibrium relative humidity of from 0% to less than 30%, preferably from 0% to 20%, when measured at a temperature of 35"C. Typically, the equilibrium relative humidity is determined as follows: 300g of composition is placed in a 1 litre container made of a water-impermeable material and fitted with a lid capable of scaling the container. The lid is provided with a scalable hole adapted to allow insertion of a probe into the interior of the container. The container and its contents are maintained at a temperature of 35°C for 24 hours to allow temperature equilibration. A solid state hygrometer (Hygrotest 6100 sold by Testoterm Ltd, Hapshire, UK) is used to measure the water vapour pressure. This is done by inserting the probe into the interior of the container via the scalable hole in the container's lid and measuring the water vapour pressure of the head space. These measurements are made at 10 minute intervals until the water vapour pressure has equilibrated. The probe then automatically converts the water vapour pressure reading into an equilibrium relative humidity value.<br>
Preferably, the composition upon contact with water at a concentration of 9.2g/l and at a temperature of 20"C forms a transparent wash liquor having (i) a turbidity of less than 500 nephelometric turbidity units; and (ii) a pH in the range of from 8 to 12. Preferably,<br><br>
the resultant wash liquor has a turbidity of less than 400, or less than 300, or from 10 to 300 nephelometric turbidity units. The turbidity of the wash liquor is typically measured using a HI 93703 microprocessor turbidity meter. A typical method for measuring the turbidity of the wash liquor is as follows: 9.2g of composition is added to I litre of water in a beaker to form a solution. The solution is stirred for 5 minutes at 600rpm at 20°C. The turbidity of the solution is then measured using a H1 93703 microprocessor turbidity meter following the manufacturer's instructions.<br>
Anionic detersive surfactant<br>
The detergent composition comprises anionic detersive surfactant. Preferably, the composition comprises from 5% to 25%, by weight of the composition, of anionic detersive surfactant. Preferably, (he composition comprises from 6% to 20%, or from 7% to 18%, or from 8% to 15%, or from 8% to 11 % or even from 9% to 10%, by weight of the composition, of anionic detersive surfactant. The anionic detersive surfactant is preferably selected from the group consisting of: linear or branched, substituted or unsubstituted C8-18alkyl sulphates; linear or branched, substituted or unsubstitutcd C8-18 linear alkylbenzene sulphonates; linear or branched, substituted or unsubstituted C8-18 alkyl alkoxylatcd sulphates having an average degree of alkoxylation of from 1 to 20; linear or branched, substituted or unsubstituted C12-C18 alkyl carboxylates; and mixtures thereof. The anionic detersive surfactant can be an alkyl sulphate, an alkyl sulphonate, an alkyl phosphate, an alkyl phosphonate, an alkyl carboxylate or any mixture thereof. The anionic surfactant can be selected from the group consisting of: C10-C18 alkyl benzene sulphonates (LAS), preferably linear C10-C13 alkyl benzene sulphonates; C10-C20 primary, branched-chain, linear-chain and random-chain alkyl sulphates (AS), preferred are linear alkyl sulphates, typically having the following formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein, M is hydrogen or a cation which provides charge neutrality, preferred cations include sodium and ammonium cations, wherein x is an integer of at least 7, preferably at least 9; C10-C18 secondary (2,3) alkyl sulphates having the following formulae:<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein, M is hydrogen or a cation which provides charge neutrality, preferred cations include sodium and ammonium cations, wherein x is an integer of at least 7, preferably at least 9, y is an integer of at least 8, preferably at least 9; C10-C18 alkyl alkoxy carboxylatcs; mid-chain branched alkyl sulphates as described in more detail in US 6,020,303 and US 6,060,443; modified alkylbenzene sulphonate (MLAS) as described in more detail in WO 99/05243, WO 99/05242, WO 99/05244, WO 99/05082, WO 99/05084, WO 99/05241, WO 99/07656, WO 00/23549, and WO 00/23548; methyl ester sulphonate (MES); alpha-olefin sulphonate (AOS) and mixtures thereof.<br>
Preferred anionic detersive surfactants are selected from the group consisting of: linear or branched, substituted or unsubstituted, C12-18 alkyl sulphates; linear or branched, substituted or unsubstituled, C10-18 alkylbenzene sulphonales, preferably linear C10-13 alkylbenzene sulphonates; linear or branched, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl alkoxylaled sulphates having an average degree of alkoxylation of from 1 to 20, preferably linear C10-18 alkyl ethoxylated sulphates having an average degree of cthoxylation of from 3 to 7; and mixtures thereof. Highly preferred arc commercially available C10-13 linear alkylbenzene sulphonates. Highly preferred are linear C10-13 alkylbenzene sulphonates that are obtained by sulphonating commercially available linear alkyl benzenes (LAB); suitable LAB include low 2-phenyl LAB, such as those supplied by Sasol under the tradename Isochem® or those supplied by Petresa under the tradename Petrelab®, other suitable LAB include high 2-phenyl LAB, such as those supplied by Sasol under the tradename Hyblene®.<br>
It may be preferred lor the anionic detersive surfactant to be structurally modified in such a manner as to cause the anionic detersive surfactant to be more calcium tolerant and less likely to precipitate out of the wash liquor in the presence of free calcium ions. This structural modification could be the introduction of a methyl or ethyl moiety in the vicinity of the anionic detersive surfactant's head group, as this can lead to a more calcium tolerant anionic detersive surfactant due to steric hindrance of the head group,<br><br>
which may reduce the anionic detersive surfactant's affinity for complexing with free calcium cations in such a manner as to cause precipitation out of solution. Other structural modifications include the introduction of functional moieties, such as an amine moiety, in the alkyl chain of the anionic detersive surfactant; this can lead to a more calcium tolerant anionic detersive surfactant because the presence of a functional group in the alkyl chain of an anionic detersive surfactant may minimise the undesirable physicochemical property of the anionic detersive surfactant to form a smooth crystal structure in the presence of free calcium ions in the wash liquor. This may reduce the tendency of the anionic detersive surfactant to precipitate out of solution.<br>
The composition preferably comprises from 0.1% to 10%, by weight of the composition, of alkoxylated anionic detersive surfactant. This is the optimal level of alkoxylaled anionic detersive surfactant to provide good greasy soil cleaning performance, to give a good sudsing profile, and to improve the hardness tolerancy of the overall detersive surfactant system. It may be preferred for the composition to comprise from 3% to 5%, by weight of the composition, of alkoxylated anionic detersive surfactant, or it may be preferred for the composition to comprise from 1% to 3%, by weight of the composition, of alkoxylated anionic detersive surfactant.<br>
Preferably, the alkoxylated anionic detersive surfactant is a linear or branched, substituted or unsubstituted C12-18alkyl alkoxylated sulphate having an average degree of alkoxylation of from 1 to 30, preferably from 1 to 10. Preferably, the alkoxylated anionic detersive surfactant is a linear or branched, substituted or unsubstituted C12-18 alkyl ethoxylated sulphate having an average degree of ethoxylation of from 1 to 10. Most preferably, the alkoxylated anionic detersive surfactant is a linear unsubstituted C12-18 alkyl ethoxylated sulphate having an average degree of ethoxylation of from 3 to 7.<br>
Preferably, at least part of, more preferably all of, the alkoxylated anionic detersive surfactant is in the form of a non-spray-dried powder such as an extrudate, agglomerate, preferably an agglomerate. This is especially preferred when it is desirable to incorporate high levels of alkoxylated anionic detersive surfactant in the composition.<br>
The alkoxylated anionic detersive surfactant may also increase the non-alkoxylatcd anionic detersive surfactant activity by making the non-alkoxylated anionic detersive surfactant less likely to precipitate out of solution in the presence of free calcium cations.<br><br>
Preferably, the weight ratio of non-alkoxylated anionic detersive surfactant to alkoxylated anionic detersive surfactant present in the composition is less than 5:1, or less than 3:1, or less than 1.7:1, or even less than 1.5:1. This ratio gives optimal whiteness maintenance performance combined with a good hardness tolerancy profile and a good sudsing profile. However, it may be preferred that the weight ratio of non-alkoxylaled anionic detersive surfactant to alkoxylated anionic detersive surfactant is greater than 5:1, or greater than 6:1, or greater than 7:1, or even greater than 10:1. This ratio gives optimal greasy soil cleaning performance combined with a good hardness tolerency profile, and a good sudsing profile.<br>

A 0.5% by weight solution of  -glucan (Sigma No. G6513) in 50mM glycine buffer (pH 9.0) is used for this purpose. 250µl of this solution arc added to 250µ1 of a solution containing the agent to be tested for glucanolytic activity and incubated for 30 minutes at 40°C. i.5ml of a 1 % by weight solution of p-hydroxybcnzoic acid hydrazidc (PAHBAH) in 0.5M NaOH, which contains ImM bismuth nitrate and ImM potassium sodium tartrate, are then added, after which the solution is heated for 10 minutes to 70°C. After cooling (2 minutes/0°C.), the absorption at 410nm is determined against a blank value at room temperature (for example with a Uvikon® 930 photometer) using a glucose calibration curve. The blank value is a solution which is prepared in the same way as the measuring solution except that the glucan solution is added after the PAHBAH solution. l.OOU corresponds to the quantity of enzyme which produces Iµmole of glucose per minute under these conditions.<br>
