COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10 and Rule 13]<br>
"REFRIGERATING MACHINE OIL COMPOSITION"<br>
NIPPON MITSUBISHI OIL CORPORATION, a Japanese corporation, of 3-12, Nishi-shimbashi 1-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo 105-8412, JAPAN,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this<br>
invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-	<br><br>
The present invention relates to a refrigerating machine oil composition. TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
- The present invention relates to a .refrigerating machine oil composition, particularly relates to a refrigerating machine oil composition characterized in containing a specific alicyclic dicarboxylic acid ester   compound<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Owing to the restriction of fluorocarbons for prevention of ozone layer destruction and prevention of global warming, efforts are being made to replace chlorine-containing refrigerants such as CFC (chlorofluorocarbon) and HCFC (hydrochlorofluorocarbon) with HFC (hydrofluorocarbon) , and to realize high efficiency of a refrigerating system. On the other hand, since HFC refrigerants are also the objects under the restriction for preventing global warming, the application of natural refrigerants such as carbon dioxide, ammonia,- hydrocarbons have been researched.<br>
In accordance with the efforts to substitute the above-mentioned refrigerants,for the conventional refrigerants, various refrigerating machine oils have been developed.  These refrigerating machine oils must satisfy a number of performance requirements including lubricity (lubricating action) , refrigerant miscibility, heat<br><br><br>
stability/hydrolysis resistance, electric insulating ability, low hygroscopicity and the like. Therefore, the compounds contained in the refrigerating machine oils are selected to meet the required performances on the basis of the type and the use of the refrigerants. For example, refrigerating machine oils for HFC refrigerants may contain oxygen compounds such as esters, ethers and carbonates that are miscible with the refrigerant, or they may contain alkylbenzene having inferior miscibility with the refrigerant but having excellent lubricity, heat stability and hydrolysis resistance.<br>
In order to achieve a high efficiency of a refrigerating system, the efforts have been made to lower the viscosity of the refrigerating machine oil. The ester refrigerating machine oils, such as polyol ester obtained from the reaction between an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol and a fatty acid, are disclosed in Japanese Translation Publication No. Hei 3-505602 (JP-A 3-505602) of International Publication for Patent Application and Japanese Patent Kokai (Laid-Open) Publication No. Hei 3-128991 (JP-A3-128991) . One effective means for lowering viscosity of such kinds of ester refrigerating machine oils is to select a fatty acid having a small number of carbon atoms in its alkyl group. However, in general, an ester obtained from a fatty acid with a small alkyl group would have low heat stability and hydrolysis resistance.<br><br>
Japanese Patent Kokai (Laid-open) Publication No. Hei 9-221690 (JP-A 9-221690) discloses an alicyclic polycarboxylic acid ester which is an ester refrigerating machine oil having excellent heat stability and hydrolysis resistance. However, problems still exist. The miscibility with a refrigerant is insufficient when the number of carbon atoms of the terminal alkyl group on the ester site is large. On the other hand, the heat stability/hydrolysis resistance of the refrigerating machine oil is inferior and the lubricity is insufficient when the number of carbon atoms of the terminal alkyl group on the ester site is small.<br>
Therefore, an ester refrigerating machine oil that has all of low viscosity (for obtaining a high efficiency) , high lubricity, high heat stability/hydrolysis resistance andhigh refrigerant miscibility, and can also satisfy other required performances has not be developed yet. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been accomplished to solve the above-mentioned technical problems. Therefore, an obj ect of the present invention is to provide a refrigerating machine oil composition having excellent lubricity, refrigerant miscibility, heat stability/hydrolysis resistance, electric insulating ability and other performances, and can achieve a high efficiency of a refrigerating system when it is used together with an HFC<br>
refrigerant or a natural refrigerant such as carbon dioxide /  and hydrocarbon.<br>
As the results of intensive researches conducted by the present inventors to achieve the above described"obj ect, it is found that an excellent refrigerating machine oil composition having the above-mentioned various excellent performances can be obtained by using a base oil comprising a specif ic ester oil.<br>
The refrigerating machine oil composition according to the present invention comprises an alicylic dicarboxylic acid ester compound having an alicyclic ring and two ester groups represented by formula (1) bonded to adjacent carbon atoms of the alicyclic ring:<br>
-COOR1      (1) wherein R1 represents an alky 1 group having 1-18 carbon atoms . This alicyclic dicarboxylic acid ester compound is obtained by using an alcohol component comprising:<br>
(a)	at least one alcohol selected from a group consisting of fatty alcohols each having 1 to 5 carbon atoms; and<br>
(b)	at least one alcohol selected from a group consisting of fatty alcohols each having 6 to 18 carbon atoms.<br>
The fatty alcohol in foregoing (a) is preferably: (i) at least one alcohol selected from a group consisting of n-butanol and n-pentanol; or<br>
(ii) at least one alcohol selected from a group<br><br>
consisting of iso-butanol and iso-pentanol.<br>
Further, the fatty alcohol in the foregoing (b) is at least one alcohol selected from a group consisting of fatty alcohols preferably having 6 to 12 carbon atoms and more preferably having 7 to 9 carbon atoms.<br>
Furthermore, the ratio (mole ratio) between the fatty alcohol (a) and fatty alcohol (b) employed as the alcohol component is preferably 1:99 to 99:1.<br>

The epoxy compound is preferably at least one compound selected from a group consisting of phenylglycidyl ether epoxy compounds, glycidyl ester epoxy compounds, alicyclic epoxy compounds and epoxidized aliphatic acid monoesters, among which glycidyl ester epoxy compounds and/or alicyclic epoxy compounds are more preferable.<br>
A fluid composition for refrigerating machines according to the present invention comprises the above-described refrigerating machine oil composition according to the present invention and a chlorine-free fluorocarbon. BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The best modes for carrying out the present invention will be explained in detail hereinafter.<br>
The alicylic dicarboxylic acid ester compound<br>
according to the present invention has an alicyclic ring and two ester groups represented by formula (1) bonded to adjacent carbon atoms of the alicyclic ring:<br>
-COOR1      (1) wherein R1 represents analkyl group having 1-18 carbon atoms . This alicyclic dicarboxylic acid ester compound is obtained by using an alcohol component comprising:<br>
(a)	at least one alcohol selected from a group consisting of fatty alcohols each having 1 to 5 carbon atoms; and<br>
(b)	at least one alcohol selected from a group consisting of fatty alcohols each having 6 to 18 carbon atoms .<br>
Here, the examples of the alicyclic ring include cyclopentane ring, cyclopentene ring, cyclohexane ring, cyclohexene ring, cycloheptane ring, cycloheptene ring, etc., among which cyclohexane ring and cyclohexene ring are preferable. Further, cyclohexane ring is preferable since the rise of its viscosity is small in the use for a long term or under severe conditions, whereas cyclohexene ring is preferable since the rise of its total acid value is small in the use for a long term or under severe conditions.<br>
In addition to the alicyclic ring, the alicyclic dicarboxylic acid ester compound must have two ester groups represented by formula (1). The carboxylic acid ester compound only having one ester group is not preferable since its miscibility with the refrigerant and heat<br><br>
stability/hydrolysis resistance are insufficient. On the other hand, the compound having 3 or more ester groups is not preferable from the viewpoint of low temperature fluidity.<br>
Further, the two ester groups represented by formula (1) must be bonded to adjacent carbon atoms of the alicyclic ring. The dicarboxylic acid ester compound, wherein the ester groups are not bonded to adjacent carbon atoms of the alicyclic ring, is not preferable since its heat stability/hydrolysis resistance and its lubricity are insufficient.<br>
The orientation of the two adjacent ester groups represented by formula (1) may be in single cis-form, single trans-form or mixed cis- and trans-forms. However, when consideration is given to heat stability and hydrolysis resistance, cis-form is preferable, whereas when consideration is given to both heat stability/hydrolysis resistance and lubricity, trans-form is preferable.<br>
Among R1 in formula (1) , the alkyl group deriving from the foregoing fatty alcohol (a) is an alkyl group having 1 to 5 carbon atoms. When consideration is given to the heat stability/hydrolysis resistance, this alkyl group preferably has 3 to 5 carbon atoms. The alkyl group having 1-5 carbon atoms may be straight or branched chain alkyl groups. Straight chain alkyl groups are preferable when consideration is given to the lubricity, whereas branched<br><br>
chainalkyl groups are preferable when consideration is given to the refrigerant miscibility and heat stability/hydrolysis resistance.<br>
The concrete examples of the alkyl groups having 1 to 5 carbon atoms include methyl group, ethyl group, straight or branched chain propyl group, straight or branched chain butyl group and straight or branched chain pentyl group, among which n-butyl group and n-pentyl group are preferable from the viewpoint of the lubricity; whereas iso-butyl group and iso-pentyl group are preferable from the viewpoint of heat stability/hydrolysis resistance.<br>
Among Rl in formula (1), the alkyl group deriving from the foregoing fatty alcohol (b) is an alkyl group having 6 to 18 carbon atoms. When consideration is given to the refrigerant miscibility, this alkyl group has preferably 6 to 12, more preferably 7 to 9 carbon atoms. The alkyl group having 6-18 carbon atoms may be straight or branched chain alkyl groups. Straight chain alkyl groups are preferable when consideration is given to the lubricity, whereas branched chain alkyl groups are preferable when consideration is given to the refrigerant miscibility and heat stability/hydrolysis resistance. Further, the alkyl groups having more than 18 carbon atoms are not preferable since the refrigeration miscibility and the low temperature fluidity are inferior.<br>
The example of the alkyl groups including 6 to 18 carbon<br><br><br>
atoms include straight or branched chain hexyl group, straight or branched chain hep tyl group, straight or branched chain octyl group, straight or branched chain nonyl group, straight or branched chain decyl group, straight or branched chain undecyl group, straight or branched chain dodecyl group, straight or branched chain tridecyl group, straight or branched chain tetradecyl group, straight or branched chain pentadecyl group, straight orbranched chainhexadecyl group, straight or branched chain heptadecyl group, straight or branched chain octadecyl group, etc, among which n-heptyl group, n-octyl group, n-nonyl group and n-decyl group are preferable when consideration is given to both lubricity and miscibility, wherein iso-heptyl group, 2-ethylhexyl group and 3,5,5-trimethylhexyl group are preferable when consideration is given to both miscibility and heat stability/hydrolysis resistance.<br>
The alicyclic dicarboxylic acid ester compound according to the present invention is prepared by using the foregoing alcohol (a) and alcohol (b). The alicyclic dicarboxylic acid ester compound can be:<br>
(A)	an ester having two ester groups represented by formula (1) in a molecule, wherein one ester group derives from the alcohol (a) and the other ester group derives from the alcohol (b)/<br>
(B)	a mixture of an ester having two ester groups represented by formula (1) in a molecule wherein both the<br><br>
ester groups derive from alcohol (a) and an ester having two ester groups represented by formula (1) in a molecule wherein both the ester groups derive from the alcohol (b); or<br>
(C) a mixture of (A) and (B).<br>
Any one of the foregoing (A), (B) and (C) can be used as the alicyclic dicarboxylic acid ester compound according to the present invention, whereas (A) or (C) is preferable when taking into consideration the heat stability/hydrolysis resistance.<br>
When (C) is used in the present invention, the ratio of (A) to (B) is not particularly limited, whereas from the viewpoint of heat stability/hydrolysis resistance, the content of (A) is preferably not less than 5% by mass, more preferably not less than 10% by mass, furthermore preferably not less than 15% by mass, and particularly preferably not less than 20% by mass, of the total amount of (A) and (B) . While the alicyclic dicarboxylic acid ester compound according to the present invention is obtained by use of two or more kinds of alcohols, one obtained by using only one kind of alcohol is unfavorable in that it cannot simultaneously satisfy all the performances of heat stability/hydrolysis resistance, lubricity, and refrigerant miscibility.  For example, if one kind of alcohol in the above-mentioned (a) is used alone, then the resulting compound is unfavorable in that not only its heat<br><br>
stability/hydrolysis resistance is inferior but also its lubricity becomes insufficient. If one kind of alcohol in the above-mentioned (b) is used alone, on the other hand, then the resulting compound is unfavorable in that its refrigerant miscibility becomes insufficient.<br>
Further, while the alicyclic dicarboxylic acid ester compound according to the present invention is obtained by use of two or more kinds of alcohols, it is particularly important that both of the alcohol in the above-mentioned (a) and the alcohol in the above-mentioned (b) be used.  If two or more kinds of alcohols (a) are used alone, then the resulting compound is unfavorable in that not only its heat stability/hydrolysis resistance is inferior but also its lubricity becomes insufficient.  If two or more kinds of alcohols (b) are used alone, on the other hand, then the resulting compound is unfavorable in that its refrigerant miscibility becomes insufficient.<br>
In the alicyclic dicarboxylic acid ester compound according to the present invention, the ratio (mole ratio) of R1 deriving from the alcohol (a) to R1 deriving from the alcohol (b) is not particularly limited. However, in order to simultaneously attain all the required performances including lubricity, heat stability/hydrolysis resistance and refrigerant miscibility, the ratio is preferably with a range of 1:99 to 99:1.<br>
Further, when the miscibility is emphasized, the<br><br>
above-mentioned ratio is preferably within a range of 60:40 to 99:1, more preferably within a range of 70:30 to 99:1, and the most preferably within a range of 80:20 to 99:1, On the other hand, when the heat stability/hydrolysis resistance and lubricity are emphasized, the foregoing ratio is preferably within a range of 1: 99 to 60 : 40, more preferably within a range of 1:99 to 50:50, and the most preferably within a range of 1:99 to 40:60.<br>
Further, it is natural that the alicyclic dicarboxylic acid ester compound may have one or more hydrocarbon groups bonded to carbon atoms of its alicyclic ring. The hydrocarbon groups are preferably alkyl groups, and particularly preferably methyl group when consideration is given to its miscibility with a refrigerant.<br>
The alicyclic dicarboxylic acid ester compound according to the present invention having the above-described structure is prepared by employing a conventional method to esterifying predetermined acid and alcohol components preferably in the atmosphere of an inert gas such as nitrogen, or in the atmosphere of an esterif ication catalyst, or by heating the reactants without using a catalyst.<br>
The acid component for the alicyclic dicarboxylic acid ester compound may be a cycloalkane dicarboxylic acid, a cycloalkene dicarboxylic acid, or an acid anhydride thereof that can form an ester compound having two ester groups bonded<br><br>
to the adjacent carbon atoms of the alicyclic ring. These acid components can be used singly or jointly as a mixture including two or more of said acids.  For example, 1,2-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid, 4-cyclohexene-l,2-dicarboxylic acid, 1-cyclohexene-l,2-dicarboxylic acid, 3-methyl-l,2-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid, 4-methyl-l,2-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid, 3-methyl-4-cyclohexene-l, 2-dicarboxylic acid, 4-methyl-4-cyclohexene-l, 2-dicarboxylic acid and acid anhydrides thereof are disclosed. Among these acids, 1,2-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid, 3-methyl-l,2-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid, 4-methyl-l,2-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid and the acid anhydrides thereof are preferable from the viewpoint of restraining the rise of viscosity when the ester compounds prepared from these acids are used for a long term or under severe conditions, and 1, 2-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid is more preferable due to the excellent miscibility. On the other hand, 4-cyclohexene-l,2-dicarboxylic acid, 1-cyclohexene-l,2-dicarboxylic acid, 4-methyl-l,2-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid, 3-methyl-4-cyclohexene-l, 2-dicarboxylic acid, 4-methyl-4-cyclohexene-l,2-dicarboxylic acid and the acid anhydrides thereof are preferable from the viewpoint of restraining the rise of total acid value in the use for a<br><br>
long term or under severe conditions, and 4-cyclohexene-l, 2-dicarboxylic acid is more preferable due to the excellent miscibility and the excellent heat stability/hydrolysis resistance.<br>
There is no particular limit to the method for preparing the alicyclic dicarboxylic acids and the acid anhydrides thereof, and the acids or the acid anhydrides obtained by any method can be used. For example, 4-cyclohexene-l ,2-dicarboxylic acid can be obtained from the reaction between butadiene and maleic acid anhydride in a benzene solvent at 100°C.<br>
In the alcohol component for the alicyclic dicarboxylic acid ester compound according to the present invention, the foregoing alcohol (a) is a straight chain alcohol having 1 to 5 carbon atoms or a branched chain alcohol having 3 to 5 carbon atoms, for example, methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, n-butanol, n-pentanol, iso-propanol, iso-butanol, sec-butanol, iso-pentanol, etc. Among these alcohols, n-butanol and n-pentanol are preferable from the viewpoint of the lubricity, whereas iso-butanol and iso-pentanol are preferable from the viewpoint of heat stability/hydrolysis resistance.<br>
Further, the foregoing alcohol (b) is a straight chain alcohol having 6 to 18 carbon atoms or a branched chain alcohol having 6 to 18 carbon atoms, for example, n-hexanol, n-heptanol, n-octanol, n-nonanol, n-decanol, n-undecanol,<br><br>

The sum amount of the alcohol (a) and alcohol (b) components in the esterification is, for example, 1.0 to 1. 5 equivalencies, preferably 1. 05 to 1.2 equivalencies with respect to 1 equivalency of the acid component.<br>
Further, the alicyclic dicarboxylic acid ester compound according to the present invention can also be obtained by transesterif ication using lower alcohol esters of the above-mentioned acids and/or acetic esters or propionic acid esters of corresponding alcohols instead of the above-mentioned acid and alcohol components.<br>
The examples of the esterif ication catalysts include Lewis acids (e.g., aluminum derivatives, tin derivatives, titanium derivatives, etc.); alkali metal salts (e.g., sodium alkoxides, potassium alkoxides, etc.); and sulfonic acids (e.g., para- toluenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic<br><br>
acid, sulfuric acid, etc.). The amount of the catalyst to be used is, for example, about 0.1 to 1 % by mass of the total amount of the raw materials including the acid and alcohol components. When taking into consideration the effect of the catalyst to the heat stability/hydrolysis resistance of the alicyclic dicarboxylic acid ester compound obtained from the esterification, Lewis acids such as aluminum derivatives, tin derivatives, titanium derivatives and the like are preferable, and tin derivatives are particularly preferable from the viewpoint of reaction efficiency.<br>
The temperature for esterification is, for example, 150°C to 230°C, and the time for completing the reaction is generally 3 to 30 hours.<br>
After the esterification, the excessive rawmaterials are removed by vacuum distillation or atmospheric distillation. Subsequently, the ester compound is refined with a conventional refining method such as liquid-liquid extraction, vacuum distillation, or adsorption refining methods such as activated carbon treatment.<br>
There is no particular restriction on the content of the alicyclic dicarboxylic acid ester compound in the refrigerating machine oil composition according to the present invention. However, in order to make the alicyclic dicarboxylic acid ester compound exhibit its various performances, the content thereof is preferably 5% by mass<br><br>

As the base oil of the refrigerating machine oil composition according to the present invention, the alicyclic dicarboxylic acid ester compound may be used singly or in combination with an oxygen-containing synthetic oil such as esters (for example, polyol esters, complex esters, etc.) other than the alicylic dicarboxylic acid esters specified in the present invention, polyglycols, polyvinyl ethers, ketones, polyphenyl ethers, silicone, polysiloxanes, or perfluoro ethers.<br>
There is no particular restriction on the amount of the oxygen-containing synthetic oil to be incorporated into the refrigerating machine oil composition. However, in order to improve thermal efficiency and attain heat stability/hydrolysis resistance of the refrigerating machine oil, the content of the oxygen-containing synthetic oil is preferably not more than 150 parts by weight and more preferably not more than 100 parts by weight with respect to 100 parts by weight of the alicyclic dicarboxylic acid ester compound.-<br><br><br>

Next, the following tests were carried out in respect to each of the above-described sample oils. (Refrigerant Miscibility Test)<br>
In accordance with "Refrigerant Miscibility Testing<br><br><br>
Method" of JIS-K-2211 "Refrigerating machine oil," lOg of each of the sample oils was blended with 40g of HFC 134a refrigerant to observe whether the sample oils and the refrigerant were miscible with each other at -10°C, or separate from each other or in the state of a white suspension. The results are shown in Tables 1-8. (Electric Insulating Ability Test)<br>
The volume resistivity at 25°C of each of the sample oils was measured in accordance with JIS-C-2101 "Electric Insulating Oil Testing Method." The results are shown in Tables 1-8. (Heat Stability/Hydrolysis Resistance Test I)<br>
90g of each of the sample oils wherein the water content had been adjusted to lOOOppm were weighted and sealed in an autoclave together with lOg of HFC 134a refrigerant and catalysts (iron, copper and aluminum wires), and subsequently heated at 200°C. Two weeks later, the appearances of the sample oils and the appearance of the catalysts were observed, and the volume resistivity of the sample oils and the total acid values of the sample oils were measured. The results are shown in Tables 1-8. (Lubricity Test)<br>
The sample oils were each applied to a test journal for measuring the amount of the test journal (pin) worn by having the test machine run in at a test oil temperature of 100°C under a load of 150 lb for 1 minute and then run<br><br>
under a load of 250 lb for 2 hours in accordance with ASTM<br>
D 2 670 "FALEX WEAR TEST." The results of the measurement<br>
are shown in Tables 1-8.<br>
(Heat Stability/Hydrolysis Resistance Test II)<br>
In accordance with JIS-K-2540, 30 g of each of the sample oils were weighed and collected into a 50-ml beaker, which was subsequently sealed with an aluminum foil and then was left in a 150°C thermostat equipped with a rotating plate . After the lapse of 7 days, the appearances of the sample<br>
oils, the kinematic viscosity of the sample oils at 40°C, and the total acid values of the sample oils were evaluated. Thus obtained results are shown in Tables 1, 4, 5, and 7.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
It is shown clearly by the results stated in Tables 1 to 8 that the sample oils in Examples 1 to 20 of the refrigerating machine oil composition according to the present invention have the excellent and well-balanced performances including kinematic viscosity, refrigerant miscibility, electric insulating ability, hydrolysis resistance, heat stability and lubricity when it is used together with an HFC refrigerant.<br>
It is also clarified by the results shown in Table 2 that more excellent heat stability/hydrolysis resistance can be obtained when a glycidyl ester epoxy compound is incorporated as an additive; and more excellent lubricity can be obtained when a phosphorus compound is used as an additive.
