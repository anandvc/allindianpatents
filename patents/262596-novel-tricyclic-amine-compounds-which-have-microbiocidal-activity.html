It has now been found that the compounds of formula (I) according to the invention have, for practical purposes, a very advantageous spectrum of activities for protecting useful plants against diseases that are caused by phytopathogenic microorganisams, such as fungi, bacteria or viruses.<br>
The invention relates to a method of controlling or preventing infestation of useful plants by phytopathogenic microorganisms, wherein a compound of formula (I) is applied as acitve ingredient to the plants, to parts thereof or the locus thereof. The compounds of formula (I) according to the invention are distinguished by excellent activity at low rates of application, by being well tolerated by plants and by being environmentally safe. They have very useful curative, preventive and systemic properties and are used for protecting numerous useful plants. The compounds of formula (I) can be used to inhibit or destroy the diseases that occur on plants or parts of plants (fruit, blossoms, leaves, stems, tubers, roots) of different crops of useful plants, while at the same time protecting also those parts of the plants that grow later e.g. from phytopathogenic microorganisms.<br>
It is also possible to use compounds of formula (I) as dressing agents for the treatment of plant propagation material, in particular of seeds (fruit, tubers, grains) and plant cuttings (e.g. rice), for the protection against fungal infections as well as against phytopathogenic fungi occurring in the soil.<br>
Furthermore the compounds of formula (I) according to the invention may be used for controlling fungi in related areas, for example in the protection of technical materials, including wood and wood related technical products, in food storage or in hygiene management.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) are, for example, effective against the phytopathogenic fungi of the following classes: Fungi imperfecti (e.g. Botrytis, Pyricularia, Helminthosporium, Fusarium, Septoria, Cercospora and Alternaria) and Basidiomycetes (e.g. Rhizoctonia, Hemileia, Puccinia). Additionally, they are also effective against the Ascomycetes classes (e.g. Venturia and Erysiphe, Podosphaera, Monilinia, Uncinula) and of the Oomycetes classes (e.g. Phytophthora, Pythium, Plasmopara). Good activity has been observed against Asian soybean rust (Phakopsora pachyrhizi). Good activity has also been observed against rust diseases, such as Puccinia<br>
recondita spp. Furthermore, the novel compounds of formula (I) are effective against phytopathogenic bacteria and viruses (e.g. against Xanthomonas spp, Pseudomonas spp, Erwinia amylovora as well as against the tobacco mosaic virus).<br>
Within the scope of the invention, useful plants to be protected typically comprise the following species of plants: cereal (wheat, barley, rye, oat, rice, maize, sorghum and related species); beet (sugar beet and fodder beet); pomes, drupes and soft fruit (apples, pears, plums, peaches, almonds, cherries, strawberries, raspberries and blackberries); leguminous plants (beans, lentils, peas, soybeans); oil plants (rape, mustard, poppy, olives, sunflowers, coconut, castor oil plants, cocoa beans, groundnuts); cucumber plants (pumpkins, cucumbers, melons); fibre plants (cotton, flax, hemp, jute); citrus fruit (oranges, lemons, grapefruit, mandarins); vegetables (spinach, lettuce, asparagus, cabbages, carrots, onions, tomatoes, potatoes, paprika); lauraceae (avocado, cinnamomum, camphor) or plants such as tobacco, nuts, coffee, eggplants, sugar cane, tea, pepper, vines, hops, bananas and natural rubber plants, as well as ornamentals.<br>
The term "useful plants" is to be understood as including also useful plants that have been rendered tolerant to herbicides like bromoxynil or classes of herbicides (such as, for example, HPPD inhibitors, ALS inhibitors, for example primisulfuron, prosulfuron and trifloxysulfuron, EPSPS (5-enol-pyrovyl-shikimate-3-phosphate-synthase) inhibitors, GS (glutamine synthetase) inhibitors or PPO (protoporphyrinogen-oxidase) inhibitors) as a result of conventional methods of breeding or genetic engineering. An example of a crop that has been rendered tolerant to imidazolinones, e.g. imazamox, by conventional methods of breeding (mutagenesis) is Clearfield® summer rape (Canola). Examples of crops that have been rendered tolerant to herbicides or classes of herbicides by genetic engineering methods include glyphosate- and glufosinate-resistant maize varieties commercially available under the trade names RoundupReady® , Herculex I® and LibertyLink®.<br>
The term "useful plants" is to be understood as including also useful plants which have been so transformed by the use of recombinant DNA techniques that they are capable of synthesising one or more selectively acting toxins, such as are known, for example, from toxin-producing bacteria, especially those of the genus Bacillus.<br>
The term "useful plants" is to be understood as including also useful plants which have been so transformed by the use of recombinant DNA techniques that they are<br>
capable of synthesising antipathogenic substances having a selective action, such as, for example, the so-called "pathogenesis-related proteins" (PRPs, see e.g. EP-A-0 392 225). Examples of such antipathogenic substances and transgenic plants capable of synthesising such antipathogenic substances are known, for example, from EP-A-0 392 225, WO 95/33818, and EP-A-0 353 191. The methods of producing such transgenic plants are generally known to the person skilled in the art and are described, for example, in the publications mentioned above.<br>
The term "locus" of a useful plant as used herein is intended to embrace the place on which the useful plants are growing, where the plant propagation materials of the useful plants are sown or where the plant propagation materials of the useful plants will be placed into the soil. An example for such a locus is a field, on which crop plants are growing.<br>
The term "plant propagation material" is understood to denote generative parts of the plant, such as seeds, which can be used for the multiplication of the latter, and vegetative material, such as cuttings or tubers, for example potatoes. There may be mentioned for example seeds (in the strict sense), roots, fruits, tubers, bulbs, rhizomes and parts of plants. Germinated plants and young plants which are to be transplanted after germination or after emergence from the soil, may also be mentioned. These young plants may be protected before transplantation by a total or partial treatment by immersion. Preferably "plant propagation material" is understood to denote seeds.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) can be used in unmodified form or, preferably, together with carriers and adjuvants conventionally employed in the art of formulation.<br>
Therefore the invention also relates to compositions for controlling and protecting against phytopathogenic microorganisms, comprising a compound of formula (I) and an inert carrier, and to a method of controlling or preventing infestation of useful plants by phytopathogenic microorganisms, wherein a composition, comprising a compound of formula (I) as acitve ingredient and an inert carrier, is applied to the plants, to parts thereof or the locus thereof.<br>
To this end compounds of formula (I) and inert carriers are conveniently formulated in known manner to emulsifiable concentrates, coatable pastes, directly sprayable or.dilutable solutions, dilute emulsions, wettable powders, soluble powders, dusts, granulates, and also encapsulations e.g. in polymeric substances. As with the type<br>
of the compositions, the methods of application, such as spraying, atomising, dusting, scattering, coating or pouring, are chosen in accordance with the intended objectives and the prevailing circumstances. The compositions may also contain further adjuvants such as stabilizers, antifoams, viscosity regulators, binders or tackifiers as well as fertilizers, micronutrient donors or other formulations for obtaining special effects.<br>
Suitable carriers and adjuvants can be solid or liquid and are substances useful in formulation technology, e.g. natural or regenerated mineral substances, solvents, dispersants, wetting agents, tackifiers, thickeners, binders or fertilizers. Such carriers are for example described in WO 97/33890.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) or compositions, comprising a compound of formula (I) as acitve ingredient and an inert carrier, can be applied to the locus of the plant or plant to be treated, simultaneously or in succession with further compounds. These further compounds can be e.g. fertilizers or micronutrient donors or other preparations which influence the growth of plants. They can also be selective herbicides as well as insecticides, fungicides, bactericides, nematicides, molluscicides or mixtures of several of these preparations, if desiredJogether with further carriers, surfactants or application promoting adjuvants customarily employed in the art of formulation.<br>
A preferred method of applying a compound of formula (1), or a composition, comprising a compound of formula (I) as acitve ingredient and an inert carrier, is foliar application. The frequency of application and the rate of application will depend on the risk of infestation by the corresponding pathogen. However, the compounds of formula (I) can also penetrate the plant through the roots via the soil (systemic action) by drenching the locus of the plant with a liquid formulation, or by applying the compounds in solid form to the soil, e.g. in granular form (soil application). In crops of water rice such granulates can be applied to the flooded rice field. The compounds of formula (I) may also be applied to seeds (coating) by impregnating the seeds or tubers either with a liquid formulation of the fungicide or coating them with a solid formulation.<br>
A formulation, i.e. a composition comprising the compound of formula (1) and, if desired, a solid or liquid adjuvant, is prepared in a known manner, typically by intimately mixing and/or grinding the compound with extenders, for example solvents, solid carriers and, optionally, surface-active compounds (surfactants).<br>
The agrochemical formulations will usually contain from 0.1 to 99% by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 95% by weight, of the compound of formula (I), 99.9 to 1 % by weight, preferably 99.8 to 5% by weight, of a solid or liquid adjuvant, and from 0 to 25% by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 25% by weight, of a surfactant.<br>
Whereas it is preferred to formulate commercial products as concentrates, the end user will normally use dilute formulations.<br>
Advantageous rates of application are normally from 5g to 2kg of active ingredient (a.i.) per hectare (ha), preferably from lOg to 1kg a.i./ha, most preferably from 20g to 600g a.iTha. When used as seed drenching agent, convenient rates of application are from lOmg to 1 g of active substance per kg of seeds. The rate of application for the desired action can be determined by experiments. It depends for example on the type of action, the developmental stage of the useful plant, and on the the application (location, timing, application method) and can, owing to these parameters, vary within wide limits. The compounds of formula (I), or a pharmaceutical salt thereof, described above may also an advantageous spectrum of activity for the treatment and/or prevention of microbial infection in an animal.<br>
"Animal" can be any animal, for example, insect, mammal, reptile, fish, amphibian, preferably mammal, most preferably human. 'Treatment" means the use on an animal which has microbial infection in order to reduce or slow or stop the increase or spread of the infection, or to reduce the infection or to cure the infection. "Prevention" means the use on an animal which has no apparent signs of microbial infection in order to prevent any future infection, or to reduce or slow the increase or spread of any future infection.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided the use of a compound of formula (1) in the manufacture of a medicament for use in the treatment and/or prevention of microbial infection in an animal. There is also provided the use of a compound of formula (I) as a pharmaceutical agent. There is also provided the use of a compound of formula (I) as an antimicrobial agent in the treatment of an animal. According to the present invention there is also provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising as an active ingredient a compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier. This composition can be used for the treatment and/or prevention of antimicrobial infection in<br><br>
an animal. This pharmaceutical composition can be in a form suitable for oral administration, such as tablet, lozenges, hard capsules, aqueous suspensions, oily suspensions, emulsions dispersible powders, dispersible granules, syrups and elixirs. Alternatively this pharmaceutical composition can be in a form suitable for topical application, such as a spray, a cream or lotion. Alternatively this pharmaceutical composition can be in a form suitable for parenteral administration, for example injection. Alternatively this pharmaceutical composition can be in inhalable form, such as an aerosol spray.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may be effective against various microbial species able to cause a microbial infection in an animal. Examples of such microbial species are those causing Aspergillosis such as Aspergillus fumigatus, A.flavus, A. terms, A. nidulans and A. niger, those causing Blastomycosis such as Blastomyces dermatitidis; those causing Candidiasis such as Candida albicans, C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, C. krusei and C. lusitaniae; those causing Coccidioidomycosis such as Coccidioides immiris; those causing Cryptococcosis such as Cryptococcus neoformans; those causing Histoplasmosis such as Histoplasma capsulatum and those causing Zygomycosis such as Absidia corymbifera, Rhizomucor pusillus and Rhizopus arrhizus. Further examples are Fusarium Spp such as Fusarium oxysporum and Fusarium solani and Scedosporium Spp such as Scedosporium apiospermum and Scedosporium prolificans. Still further examples are Microsporum Spp, Trichophyton Spp, Epidermophyton Spp, Mucor Spp, Sporothorix Spp, Phialophora Spp, Cladosporium Spp, Petriellidium spp, Paracoccidioides Spp and Histoplasma Spp.<br>
