				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
An evaluation based learning system (EBLS) is provided which is used by authors, teachers, students and education administrators for the development of courses, the teaching of courses, The studying of courses and the administration of information and data relevant to the courses. The EBLS provides an efficient authoring, teaching and learning environment wherein a database of questions and answers are linked to a textbook to facilitate the learning and evaluation process of students studying a textbook.<br>
BACKGROUND Of THE INVENTION<br>
Teaching is a skill and an art which has developed and evolved through the ages. Generally, within an education system, there are teachers who present, teach and test students on course materials, students who receive and learn course material and who are subsequently tested, authors who prepare and organize course material and administrators who control and direct the interaction between authors, teachers and students.<br>
In the past, an author would prepare course material, normally in the form of a textbook containing printed information. An administrator would receive and distribute the textbook to teachers, the teachers would teach material within the textbook to students, prepare and administer exams to the students and students would study the course material and take exams set by the teachers.<br>
In the past, authors may include questions relating to sections of text to assist teachers in teaching the course and setting exams for the course. Alternatively, teachers would prepare questions relating to the textbook for study purposes or for setting exams wherein a student could use these questions as a component in the process of studying and learning a course.<br>
However, the processes of authoring, teaching and learning have hereto before not<br><br>
been unified. In the past, while questions which have been prepared by an author or teacher can be used by a student to study progress in a course, these questions cannot be efficiently used by a student to facilitate-asscssment of learning. Specifically, therefore, there has been a need for a system wherein a textbook contains both questions and answers relating to a course and where those questions and answers are linked to specific sections of the text of a course to create a library of questions, answers and links for a specific text. Such as system advantageously provides a teacher the ability to teach a course wherein questions relevant to the course are immediately and efficiently available to the teacher for setting homework or exams, and to the student for studying a course or for taking exams. The efficient linkages between the author of a course, the teacher of a course and the students taking the course also provides an efficient system for evaluation of the learning process through the ability to track the progress of a student in learning the material of a course.<br>
Accordingly, there has been a need for an evaluation based, computer aided, authoring, teaching and learning system to enhance the ability of authors, teachers and students to prepare, teach and learn course material.<br>
For authors, there has been a need for a system having a text editor that can be used to set up a multi-media (print, graphics, audio and video), multi-levelled textbook. In addition, there has been a need for a system which enables the development of an evaluation system by the author wherein a library of questions/answers can be developed covering the content of the textbook wherein the questions/answers are individually linked to specific components of the textbook. Upon the development of such a course, there has been a need for a system wherein the course can be easily distributed to teachers, administrators and students for use on computer systems.<br>
For students, there has been a need for a system which enables the student to study the textbook and then set-up and take a self-examination test on the textbook, wherein upon completion of the test, the system will immediately mark the test,<br><br>
provide the test score and provide the student with the ability to review the test results with a link to the textbook showing the section of the textbook containing information in the context of the correct answer.<br>
Furthermore, there has been a need for a system wherein statistics relating to the student's performance on particular sections of the textbook can be readily obtained and analysed to provide information respecting the progress of the student for both sections of or the entire course, thus allowing students to progress at their own pace with a quantitative assessment of their progress.<br>
For teachers, there has been a need for a system enabling exams to be efficiently set-up, distributed and marked with the added ability to obtain reports respecting both individual and class progress. Still further, there has been a need for a system giving teachers the ability to identify individuals or students who are having difficulty with a particular area wherein clarification can be offered to those students without holding back other students thereby enabling the education process to be individualized.<br>
In addition, there has been a need for a system wherein the course may contain multi-levelled elements to facilitate learning. More specifically, there has been a need for a system wherein an author may produce a textbook including, for example, a general outline which may be used for more generalized study, a precis introducing concepts and ideas in greater detail and a full-text version for in-depth study each with associated questions/answers and links.<br>
For administrators, there has been a need for a system which allows for the efficient set-up and distribution of computer textbook courses over computer systems and the subsequent collection and processing of information pertaining to the use of the system.<br>
A review of the prior art has indicated that such a system has not been developed. United States Patent 4,798,543 (issued January 17, 1989) is directed to an<br><br>
interactive training method and system for the selective presentation of audio and video training program information to learner operators. This patent describes a system which includes text/video/audio display of information and a system that enables an instructor to evaluate the progress of a student.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Overview<br>
In accordance with the invention, an evaluation based learning system (EBLS) 10 is described. The EBLS provides an efficient teaching and learning environment to education administrators, course authors, teachers, and students.  The system 10 generally includes a number of modules including administration 12, authoring 14, teaching 16 and student 18 modules as well as numerous sub-modules providing functionality to each of the main modules.<br>
The EBLS, as shown in Figures 1 and 2, allows the administrator, author, teacher and student entities within an education system to efficiently work within the education process, by specifically linking the functions of administrators, authors, teachers and students together to provide a streamlined administration system for education administrators, an effective authoring system for authors creating courses for teachers to teach from and students to learn from, an effective teaching system for teachers to teach from, set exams and evaluate students1 performance and an effective learning system for students to study a course and take exams from.<br>
More specifically, and with reference to Figures 1 and 3, the administration module 12 provides administrative function to the EBLS including adding teachers, publishing courses, enrolling students, distributing published courses and receiving and controlling overall student grades. The administration module interacts with the authoring module 14 which enables the creation of courses 50 by authors 49 and teachers 51 which may thereafter be published and used by teachers 51 and students 52 within the system 10. The administration module 12 also interacts with the teaching module 16 which enables a teacher 51 to access a published course 50 and set exams 53 for students 52 and with the smdent module 18 for enrolling students 52 and setting courses 50. The teaching module 16 interacts with the student module 18 which enables students 52 to access courses 50 and take exams 53. The student 52 provides an answer to exam questions 54 from which exam results 55 and student grades 56 are obtained. In addition, a student may self-test 57 to obtain specific results/averages 58.<br><br>
With reference to Figure 2, the basic functionality between the authoring 14, student 18 and teaching 16 modules is shown. Within the authoring module 14, an author uses text 60 to create a question 61 and an answer 62 to that question, the question 61 and answer 62 both relating to a specific portion of text within a document 60. The question 61 is then linked 63 to specific text within the document 60. The author may repeat this process in order to create a library of questions 61, answers 62 and links 63 to text within a document 60.<br>
Within the student module 18, the student studies the text of the document 60. Questions 61 relating to the text of the document 60 as formulated from within the authoring module may be selected (by either a teacher or a student) and answered by the student. The student's answers 64 to the questions 61 are checked for correctness against the author's answers 62 and form the basis of an evaluation 65 of the student's performance for the questions answered. Additional evaluations 66 may be conducted to determine the specific performance of an individual student or a group of students for a given section of course material and/or overall course material.<br>
A more detailed description of the functionality of the administration, authoring, teaching and student modules and their sub-modules follows as may be implemented on a computer system and/or network as shown in the Figures. With respect to the Figures, square boxes generally show executable modules while rounded boxes indicate displayed data.'<br>
Administration Module 12<br>
With reference to Figures 1 and 3, and as indicated above, the administration module (box 12) includes a number of sub-modules including adding teachers to the EBLS (box 12a), publishing courses created by authors (box 12b), enrolling students (box 12c), distributing published courses (box 12d) to teachers and students and receiving and processing student grades (box 12e).<br>
The administration module 12  may be coupled with other modules for networking<br><br>
or distribution purposes or it may have a stand-alone interface. For example, the administration module may be provided with a networked "academic" interface or alternatively a stand-alone "teacher" interface. In each case, the administrative module 12 exists as a distinct and executable module with a specific interface and inputs for its intended use.  For example, the academic interface may provide an interface appropriate for distribution and/or operation of the EBLS to/with schools/universities. The teacher interface may provide an interface appropriate for individual teachers to operate the EBLS in a more localized environment.<br>
Authoring Module 14<br>
The authoring module 14 (Figure 4) generally allows an authorized author to create a new course or modify an existing course. A course consists of at least one multimedia element such as text, audio, video and/or graphical images. In most courses, the course will be predominantly text, however, courses incorporating strictly audio and/or video could be employed. In the case of a course containing text, the text may comprise a number of sections as per a document normally created through word-processing including, for example, a table of contents, an outline, precis, glossary, dictionary and/or index in addition to the full text of the document. In accordance with the invention, a course will also consist of questions and answers to those questions in addition to one or more links from the questions to the multimedia element (Figure 2). A course may also include links from individual sections to other sections of the multi-media element, for example from the precis to the full text or from the contents to the precis and/or the full text.<br>
The creation of a course is accomplished by an author as may be authorized by the administration module 12.<br>
The authoring module 14 can be defined further in terms of a number of sub-modules as shown in Figure 4.<br>
Login Module (box 14')<br>
The login module (box 14') generally enables registered authors to gain excess to<br><br>
the authoring module 14 for the creation or modification of a EBLS course requiring entry of a user ID and password to obtain access.<br>
Choose a Course (box 14a)<br>
Once logged in, a list of courses (box 14b) shows courses available for editing. An author may select a previously created course for editing or initiate the creation of a new course. Highlighting or selecting a course from the list (box 14b) will preferably display a brief course description (box Hal). Upon selection of a particular course for modification or initiation of the creation of a new course (box 14a2), further sub-modules may be executed enabling administrative properties to be created or modified (box 14a2a), text to be added to the course (box 14a2b) or questions to added to the course (box 14a2c).<br>
Upon selection of the administrative sub-module (box 14a2a) course parameters may be created or modified through further sub-modules. These may include providing permission to other authorized authors to modify the course (box 14a2a4), allowing the user to manage different versions of the course (box 14a2a5), the ability to copy the course to a digital storage device (box 14a2a6), reading a course from a digital source (box 14a2a7) or publishing the course (box 14a2a8).<br>
The administration sub-module (box 14a2a) may also display the course ID (box!4a2al), the course title (box 14a2a2) and/or a course description (box 14a2a3).<br>
Creating or modifying a course-Text Module (box 14a2b) Within the text module (box 14a2b), an author initially creates or edits a multimedia document preferably using conventional multimedia document editors. For example, in the creation of a text document, the text module (box I4a2b) enables the author to add new text to the document (box 14a2bl) and optionally a new sound file (box 14a2b2), a new video file (box 14a2b3), and/or a new music file (box 14a2b4) to the course. An editor sub-module (box 14a2bS) provides standard word processing functionality for the author to edit the text of the course<br><br>
such as bold, italics, and/or underlining to displayed text.<br>
The questions sub-module (box 14a2c) and explained in greater detail below enables the author to create questions relating to the text of the course.<br>
Example of the Creation of a Text-based course<br>
For the purposes of illustration, the creation of a text based course proceeds as follows:<br>
In the creation of a course relating to information concerning Amnesty<br>
International, a text document containing information about Amnesty International<br>
is created in accordance with normal word processing procedures. The text of thedocument relating to Amnesty International may be imported from an external   <br>
source (box 14a2b6) or written by the author directly. The editor (box 14a2bS) preferably include a series of menu options allowing the author to effectively and efficiently create the text of the course. Still further sub-modules allow for the management of pre-defined styles (box 14a2b8) for different text elements or allow for the management of table of contents data (box 14a2b9).<br>
Creating Links between Questions and Text<br>
At the centre of the EBLS, is the ability of the author to create links between text and questions hi a visually appealing and intuitive manner. This is enabled through the links sub-module (box 14a2b7) (Figure 4a) and the questions sub-module (box 14a2c) (Figure 4B). The links sub-module (box 14a2b7) (Figure 4A) allows the introduction of colours (box LI) for highlighting the links and can be either active (box Lla) or inactive (box Lib). The creation of a link between questions and text proceeds as follows:<br>
Step 1- Labelling Text as having a link<br>
In the creation of a link between questions (described below) and text, the author, within the text of the course, highlights text and labels that text as containing a link to a single or series of questions.<br><br>
For example, the text of the course "What is Amnesty International?" is identified as having a link, and thereafter carries a specific identifier, for example, link 232. The body of text is identified by a link number marking the beginning of the text and the same number marking the end of the text-<br>
232What is Amnesty Intemational?232.<br>
The creation and/or management of links is accomplished by execution of the links sub-module (box 14a2b7) specifically through execution of the create links sub-module (box L3) and sub-modules start (box L3a), finish (box L3b) or cancel (box L3c) the creation of marked text for linking.<br>
Still further, within the links sub-module (box 14a2b7) the author can choose to show the links (box L2) through execution of an "on" sub-module (box L2a) or a "hide" sub-module (box L2b) respectively.  Accordingly, if "on" is selected (box L2a), all links which have been created within the text will be visible and, alternatively, if "hide" (box L2b) has been selected all anchor links will be invisible.<br>
Thus, a series of text within a document is marked as having links.<br>
Step 2- Creating Questions relevant to Labelled Text<br>
Upon the creation of a number of link sites within the text, wherein each link is identified by a numerical destination, the author proceeds with the creation of a question through the question module (box 14a2c) (Figure 4B).<br>
The question module (box 14a2c) provides the author with the ability to create a question relevant to the text and, more specifically, to text which has been identified as having a link.<br>
Accordingly, upon activating the question module (box 14a2c), the author may execute sub-modules allowing the creation of questions/answers (box Ql) and to<br><br>
display references (box Q2) which enables the creation of questions and answers relating to a reference.<br>
Accordingly, an author may initiate the creation of a new question/answer (box Qlb) whereupon a question field (box Qli) allows the author to enter a question, for example, "What does Amnesty International deal with?' and the answer to that question in an answer field (box Qlj). The create question/answer sub module (box Q10 may also display a unique identification number for that question (box Qla).<br>
Additional sub-modules allow the author to readily create and edit questions/answers such as a "go to first question" sub-module (box Qlc) allowing an author to immediately transfer to the first question, a "go to the previous question" sub-module (box Qld) allowing an author to return to the previous question, a " go to the next question" sub-module(box Qle) allowing an author to move forward to the next question, a "go to the last question"(box Qlf) allowing an author to move to the last question, an "accept changes to the question"sub-module (box Qlg) allowing an author to have changes in the question accepted, and a "cancel changes to the question" sub-module (box Qlh) allowing an author to cancel any changes made to a. question.<br>
With respect to the display reference sub-module (box Q2), the text of a reference is displayed (box Q2h) along with comments for that reference (box Q2g).<br>
A question must have at least one reference which indicates the correct answer. This reference is known as the primary reference. The question may also have other references (for example, other references which indicate why other choices are incorrect). Each reference consists of a link to an area of the text, and may also have an optional comment. Further sub-modules within the reference display may allow for navigating between the primary and other references of the question.<br>
The display reference sub-module therefore includes additional sub-modules such as reference list (box Q2b) allowing the selection and display of available references,<br><br>
show the current reference (box Q2c) allowing the display of the text of a selected reference, updating the current reference (box Q2d), adding selected text (box Q2e) and deleting the selected reference (box Q2f).<br>
Furthermore, within the question module (box I4a2c), different styles of questions may also be incorporated within the EBLS depending on the particular course which the author wishes to create. For example, the author may choose to create a single word answer or a multiple choice answer style wherein the student is presented with a number of different pre-defined choices.<br>
Step 3 - Linking questions and answers to text<br>
In creating a single word answer, the author may propose a question<br>
"What does Amnesty International deal with?".<br>
A single word answer to the question may be "protection" which is entered into the answer display (box Qlj).  A window displaying the text is also visible on the screen. The author may scroll through this window until the author reaches the specific text which indicates the correct answer. The author then highlights this text, and indicates ( by pressing, for example, an add reference button, a hot key or selecting a menu option) that the highlighted text is a reference to the question. A link is then made between that area of text and the question. The author may add any number of references to a particular question in this way. After the author has added all the references, the author must set the primary reference. This is achieved by selecting the reference they wish to indicate as the primary reference from the reference list. The author then indicates that this is the primary reference (by pressing, for example, a primary reference button, a hot key or selecting a menu option).<br>
Upon identifying the text with the relevant link, that is, the text containing the answer to the question, the question (box Qli), the answer (box Qlj) and the link are connected.<br><br>
Similarly, a multiple choice question and answer may be created whereby the author can create choices by entering choices for answers in the choice field which<br>
are then displayed as a list.<br>
The author may scroll through questions which have been created and edit them as described above. In each case, as the author scrolls through the questions, the answer to that question and the link from the text containing the information relevant to the answer is displayed.<br>
Thus, a series of questions with specific links to the text is developed. The text (box!4a2blO) may consist of a number of levels to which different elements such as a table of contents, references, precis and/or an outline of the full text level can be added.<br>
Once completed, the author can make the course available for publishing (box 14a2a8).<br>

Question Data Course<br>
Within a textbook, there are an identifiable number of facts or opinion contained within the textbook which, although subjective can be generally quantified when subjected to independent review by persons qualified to review such a textbook for these facts and/or opinions. Accordingly, if a series of questions, answers and links within a textbook is developed as described within the authoring module, a determination of the percentage number of questions and answers relevant to the total number of facts and/or opinions can be made. Hence, a textbook can be graded on the basis of this percentage number wherein the greater the percentage of questions/answers to the total number of facts/opinions can be used to determine the relative quality or grade of a textbook as may be defined within Table 1.<br>
Table 1 - Question Data Course Grading<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Accordingly, a question data course (QDC) can be defined as a textbook containing a plurality of questions and answers specifically linked to sections of the textbook wherein the number of questions and answers relative to the total number of facts/opinions within the textbook exceeds 50% of the total number of facts/opinions within the textbook as independently determined.<br>
The terms and expressions which have been employed in this specification are used as terms of description and not of limitations, and there is no intention in the use of<br><br>
such tenns and expressions to exclude any equivalents of the features shown and described or portions thereof, but it is recognized that various modifications are possible within the scope of the claims.<br><br><br><br>
