				<td>METHOD AND DEVICE FOR DRYING A GAS<br>
The present invention concerns an improved method for<br>
drying a gas, more particularly for drying a gas from a<br>
compressor.<br>
It is known to dry compressed gas coming from a<br>
compressor by cooling it first and by subsequently<br>
guiding it through a drying element with an adsorption<br>
and/or absorption medium.<br>
With such a known method, it is also known to alternately<br>
put this adsorption and/or absorption medium through<br>
what is called a drying zone and what is called a<br>
regeneration zone into a drier, whereby the adsorption<br>
and/or absorption medium is regenerated in the<br>
regeneration zone.<br>
To this end, according to a known method, a part of the<br>
gas to be dried is used, which is guided, without<br>
cooling it first, over the adsorption and/or absorption<br>
medium in the regeneration zone, whereby it absorbs<br>
moisture.<br>
A disadvantage of this known method is that the dried<br>
gas temporarily has an increased humidity level, i.e. an<br>
increased pressure dew point when the compressor is<br>
switched on again after a period of standstill or after<br>
a period of idle running.<br>
 <br>
Depending on the field of application of the dried air,<br>
upward peaks of the pressure dew point in the user<br>
network behind the drier are unacceptable.<br>
This problem with pressure dew point peaks occurs in<br>
particular with installations having one drier and one<br>
compressor, whereby the compressor is not constantly<br>
working at full load and with installations having<br>
several compressor/drier combinations connected in<br>
parallel and of which at least one compressor is not<br>
implemented at full load all the time.<br>
Research has revealed that a temporary increase of the<br>
pressure dew point when one or several compressors are<br>
switched on again after a period of standstill or of idle<br>
running can be explained by the following phenomenon.<br>
When the compressor is working at full load, a state of<br>
equilibrium is created so to say between the moisture<br>
content on the inlet side and on the outlet side of the<br>
drying element, whereby the drying element contains<br>
more moisture on the inlet side than on the outlet side.<br>
When the compressor is subsequently switched off or is<br>
being driven unloaded, and thus little or no gas flows<br>
through the drier, the above-mentioned equilibrium is<br>
disturbed and there will be a diffusion of moisture<br>
from the damp inlet side to the drier outlet side of the<br>
drying element.<br>
Moreover, when the compressor is switched off or is being<br>
 <br>
driven unloaded, the pressure difference between the<br>
inlet side of the regeneration zone and the outlet side<br>
of the drying zone falls away, and a flow of hot, damp<br>
air is created from the regeneration zone to the drying<br>
zone.<br>
As a result, the moisture increases on the outlet side of<br>
the drying element and even within the dried air<br>
available behind the drying element in the user network<br>
or in the connection to the user network.<br>
When the compressor is then subsequently switched on<br>
again, there will be a temporary increase of the<br>
pressure dew point of the dried gas due to the created<br>
unbalance, until the equilibrium is recovered after a<br>
while.<br>
The aim of the present invention is to remedy the above-<br>
mentioned and other disadvantages.<br>
To this end, the invention concerns a method for drying<br>
gas coming from a compressor, whereby the gas to be dried<br>
is directed through a drier of the type which mainly<br>
consists of an air receiver and a drying element in<br>
the form of a rotor in which has been provided an<br>
adsorption and/or absorption medium which is ctlternately<br>
guided through a drying zone of the air receiver for<br>
drying the gas and through a regeneration zone of the air<br>
receiver for regenerating the adsorption and/or<br>
absorption medium in the regeneration zone, whereby<br>
the gas to be dried is guided via an inlet of the<br>
 <br>
drying zone through the adsorption and/or absorption<br>
medium in the drying zone to an outlet of the drying<br>
zone for feeding a user network connected to this outlet<br>
and whereby, during periods of standstill or of idle<br>
running of the compressor, a gas flow is guided<br>
counterflow through the adsorption and/or absorption<br>
medium in the drying zone, i.e. in a flow direction from<br>
the outlet to the inlet of the drying zone.<br>
An advantage of the present invention is that by<br>
guiding a gas counterflow through the adsorption and/or<br>
absorption medium in the drying zones during periods of<br>
standstill or of idle running of the compressor, any<br>
diffusion of moisture is prevented during this period,<br>
and thus is avoided that the already dried gas would<br>
absorb moisture behind the drier.<br>
By applying this method, the pressure dew point peaks<br>
which would otherwise occur each time the compressor<br>
is switched on again after periods of standstill or<br>
of idle running are avoided in a simple manner.<br>
Another advantage connected thereto is that the dew point<br>
of the dried gas remains practically constant when the<br>
compressor is in use, and consequently has few<br>
fluctuations.<br>
Preferably, a dried gas is used to be guided<br>
counterflow through the adsorption and/or absorption<br>
medium in the drying zone.<br>
 <br>
This offers the additional advantage that the<br>
adsorption and/or absorption medium in the drying zone<br>
is dried during the periods of standstill or of idle<br>
running of the compressor, such that it is even<br>
possible that the pressure dew point of the dried<br>
gas, immediately after the compressor has been<br>
switched on again, is even lower than when the compressor<br>
is working under load.<br>
The dry gas, which is guided counterflow through the<br>
adsorption and/or absorption medium in the drying zone,<br>
is preferably branched off from the above-mentioned user<br>
network, for example by simply connecting the drying<br>
zone to the atmosphere, as a result of which dried<br>
gas from the user network under pressure will<br>
automatically flow, over the adsorption and/or<br>
absorption medium in the drying zone, to the<br>
atmosphere.<br>
The present invention also concerns a device which<br>
can be applied with the above-described method<br>
according to the invention, which device mainly<br>
consists of a drier of the type which consists of an air<br>
receiver and a drying element in the form of a rotor in<br>
which has been provided an adsorption and/or absorption<br>
medium which is alternately guided through a drying zone<br>
of the air receiver for drying the gas and through a<br>
regeneration zone of the air receiver for regenerating<br>
the adsorption and/or absorption medium in the<br>
regeneration zone, whereby the drying zone is provided<br>
with an inlet and an outlet for the gas and whereby the<br>
 <br>
device is provided with means which make it<br>
possible, during periods of standstill or of idle<br>
running of the compressor, to guide a gas flow<br>
counterflow through the adsorption and/or<br>
absorption medium in the drying zone, i.e. in a<br>
flow direction from the outlet to the inlet of the<br>
drying zone.<br>
In order to better explain the characteristics of the<br>
present invention, the following embodiment of a<br>
device according to the invention for drying a gas is<br>
given as an example only without being limitative<br>
in any way, with reference to the accompanying<br>
drawings, in which:<br>
figure 1 schematically represents a device<br>
according to the invention for drying a gas<br>
coming from a compressor;<br>
figure 2 represents the device from figure 1,<br>
but during a period of standstill of the<br>
compressor.<br>
Figure 1 represents a device 1 according to the<br>
invention for drying a gas coming from a compressor 2.<br>
The outlet of the compressor 2 is connected, via a<br>
compressed air line 3 and an after-cooler 4 implemented<br>
in the latter, to the device 1 which mainly consists of<br>
a drier 5 of the type which is described in BE 1,005,764<br>
 <br>
and which consists of an air receiver 6 which is<br>
divided in a drying zone 7 and a regeneration zone 8,<br>
with a rotatable drying element 9 which is built of a<br>
tubular rotor in which has been provided an adsorption<br>
and/or absorption medium which can be flown through, and<br>
which is alternately put through the drying zone 7 and<br>
the regeneration zone 8 by means of a drive 11.<br>
The regeneration zone 8 is formed of a sector of the<br>
drying vessel 6 which is screened off from the drying<br>
zone 7 by means of partitions 12, 13, 14.<br>
Between the inlet 15 of the drying zone 7 and the<br>
compressed air line 3 is provided a mixing device 16 for<br>
gases which has been integrated in the air receiver 6 in<br>
this case.<br>
In the given example, this mixing device 16<br>
consists of an ejector which, as is known, contains<br>
a jet pipe 17 and a mixing pipe 18, in between which is<br>
provided a suction opening 19 for sucking in gas from<br>
the regeneration zone 8.<br>
In the described drier 5 from figure 1, the mixing<br>
device 16 extends axially through the tubular,<br>
rotating drying element 9 and it is used as a drive<br>
shaft for the drying element 9 in this case, to which end<br>
the mixing pipe 18 is connected to the drive 11 by<br>
means of a shaft 20.<br>
A liquid separator 21 is optionally provided in the<br>
 <br>
drying zone 7 between the mixing device 16 and the<br>
drying element 9.<br>
The outlet 22 of the drying zone 4 is connected<br>
to a user network 24 of compressed dried gas via an<br>
outlet line 23.<br>
The inlet 25 of the regeneration zone 8 is directly<br>
connected to the outlet of the compressor 2 via a branch<br>
26 of the compressed air line 3 in a place between the<br>
compressor 2 and the after-cooler 4 so as to be able<br>
to guide uncooled compressed gas from the compressor 2<br>
through the regeneration zone 8.<br>
As is customary with this type of driers 2, the<br>
compressed air line 3 and the outlet line 23 are mutually<br>
connected by means of a bypass in which is provided a<br>
bypass valve 27 which is closed during normal use of the<br>
device, as is represented in figure 1.<br>
Also in the compressed air line 3 and in the outlet line<br>
23 are provided valves 28, 29 respectively which, as<br>
represented in figure 1, are open when the bypass valve<br>
27 is closed.<br>
The outlet 30 of the regeneration zone 8 is connected<br>
to the suction opening 19 of the mixing device 16 via<br>
a canalisation 31 and a cooler 32 which is implemented<br>
therein.<br>
In the lower point of the above-mentioned canalisation 31<br>
 <br>
is provided a condensate separator 33.<br>
According to the invention, the device 1 is provided<br>
with means 34 which make it possible to guide a gas flow<br>
counterflow through the adsorption and/or absorption<br>
medium 10 in the drying zone 7 during periods of<br>
standstill or of idle running of the compressor 2,<br>
i.e. in a direction of flow from the outlet 22 to the<br>
inlet 15 of the drying zone 7.<br>
In the case of figure 1, the above-mentioned means are<br>
formed of a drain opening 35 which can be sealed,<br>
provided in the air receiver 6 in a place between the<br>
drying element 9 and the inlet 15 of the drying zone 7.<br>
The drain opening 35 can for example be sealed by means<br>
of an electro valve 36 which is coupled to a control box<br>
which is not represented in the figures, which opens the<br>
electro valve 36 as soon as the compressor 2 is<br>
switched off or is being driven unloaded.<br>
The drain opening 35 is preferably equipped with a<br>
calibrated release valve 37 and a sound absorber 38.<br>
The working of the above-described device according to<br>
the invention is simple and as follows.<br>
In case of a normal load of the drier 2, i.e. when the<br>
compressor 1 is operational and produces compressed<br>
gas, the electro valve 36 is closed.<br>
 <br>
The compressed gas to be dried is then guided via the<br>
compressed air line 3 and the cooler 4 into the drier 5<br>
where the gas, as is represented by the arrows G in<br>
figure 1, is carried through the mixing device 16 and<br>
is subsequently dried by means of the above-mentioned<br>
liquid separator 21 and the adsorption and/or<br>
absorption medium 10 which absorbs moisture from the gas.<br>
The dried gas is subsequently guided through the<br>
outlet line 23 to the user network 24.<br>
In order to be able to regenerate the adsorption and/or<br>
absorption medium 10, the drying element 9 is driven by<br>
the drive 11 at a low rotational speed, whereby the<br>
adsorption and/or absorption medium 10 is<br>
alternately put through the drying zone 7 and the<br>
regeneration zone 8.<br>
Via the branch 25, a major percentage of the rated<br>
compressor flow, for example 35%, is branched off<br>
directly from the outlet of the compressor 2, and this<br>
uncooled gas flow, as represented by means of the arrows<br>
A in figure 1, is guided through the adsorption and/or<br>
absorption medium 10 in the regeneration zone 8, as a<br>
result of which this relatively warm and unsaturated gas<br>
absorbs the moisture from the adsorption and/or absorption<br>
medium 10.<br>
As it leaves the regeneration zone 8, this gas is first<br>
cooled in the cooler 32, before being sucked up<br>
through the suction opening 19 in the mixing device 16<br>
 <br>
so as to be mixed with the gas to be dried coming from<br>
the compressed air line 3.<br>
The condensate which is created as a result of the<br>
cooling of the gas in the cooler 32 is discharged by the<br>
condensate separator 33.<br>
When the compressor 2 is switched	off or is being<br>
driven unloaded, as is represented	in figure 2, the<br>
electro valve 36 is opened and the	drying zone 7 is<br>
connected to the atmosphere.<br>
The compressor 2 has no output at that time, as a result<br>
of which there will be no flow from the compressor 2<br>
through the drier 5 either any more.<br>
Due to the pressure difference between the user network<br>
24 and the atmospheric pressure at the drain opening 35,<br>
a gas flow of dried gas is automatically created, as is<br>
represented by means of the arrows P in figure 2, from<br>
the user network counterflow through the absorption<br>
medium 10 in the drying zone 7 and via the drain<br>
opening 35 to the outside air.<br>
In this manner is prevented that, during this period of<br>
standstill or of idle running of the compressor 2,<br>
moisture would diffuse from the inlet side of the drying<br>
zone 7 to the outlet side of the drying zone 7 and that<br>
the dried gas behind the drying element 9 would become<br>
damp as a result thereof, which would result in a<br>
sudden increase of the pressure dew point of the dried<br>
 <br>
gas when the compressor 2 is switched on again.<br>
The desired gas flow which flows counterflow through the<br>
absorption medium 10 in the drying zone 7 is<br>
determined by an appropriate selection of the release<br>
valve and it amounts to for example 2% of the rated<br>
compressor flow.<br>
It is clear that, in the preferred example, the means 34<br>
for directing a gas counterflow through the drying<br>
element 7 during periods of standstill or of idle<br>
running of the compressor 2 are realised in a very<br>
simple manner by merely providing a drain opening 35<br>
on a conventional drier of the above-described type,<br>
i.e. without any additional pipes and/or branches or any<br>
other provisions.<br>
Naturally, it is also possible to realise the above-<br>
mentioned means in other ways.<br>
The rinsing gas which is directed counterflow through<br>
the drying element during periods of standstill or of<br>
idle running " of the compressor preferably flows<br>
through the drying element over its entire length in<br>
the axial direction. However, it is not excluded for<br>
this rinsing gas to flow only through a part of this<br>
length.<br>
The drain opening 35 to the atmosphere can be<br>
provided in different places so as to create a gas<br>
flow from the user network over the drying element.<br>
 <br>
Thus, the drain opening can also be provided for<br>
example in the compressed air line 3 or in the<br>
canalisation 31.<br>
The above-described invention is by no means restricted<br>
to the above-described embodiments represented in the<br>
accompanying drawings; on the contrary, it can be<br>
realised according to different variants while still<br>
remaining within the scope of the invention.<br>
