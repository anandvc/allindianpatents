				<td>Process for preparing palladium(0) compounds<br>
The present invention relates to a process for<br>
preparing palladium(0) compounds.<br>
In the form of its compounds, palladium finds use as a<br>
catalyst in numerous industrial processes.<br>
More than 80% of the industrially produced chemicals<br>
are prepared by catalytic processes. Catalytic<br>
processes are generally more economically viable and<br>
environmentally friendly than corresponding<br>
stoichiometric organic reactions. For the attainment of<br>
high yields and selectivities in homogeneous catalytic<br>
processes, a wide range of ligand systems has to be<br>
used, which in turn requires precursor metal compounds<br>
having a wide range of uses. This makes clear the need<br>
for constant improvement in the catalyst systems and<br>
their preparation processes.<br>
For these applications, one possibility is in<br>
particular palladium compounds which contain palladium<br>
in the 0 oxidation state. In general, palladium(0)<br>
compounds are stabilized by compounds which can provide<br>
a free electron pair for coordination. This free<br>
electron pair may be provided, for example, by an<br>
unsaturated hydrocarbon or by heteroatoms such as<br>
phosphorus or nitrogen. Stably storable compounds are<br>
commercially obtainable principally only in solid form.<br>
However, compounds which are in liquid form are desired<br><br>
in catalysis. This greatly eases their usability.<br>
Often, solid compounds are dissolved in a solvent for<br>
this purpose, but solutions of solid Pd(0) compounds<br>
are usually unstable and have to be used immediately.<br>
In homogeneous catalysis applications, the precursors<br>
used are preferably compounds which can be mixed in a<br>
simple manner with ligands, for example different<br>
phosphines, so as to be able to prepare a wide range of<br>
catalysis systems. This is realized, for example, in<br>
the case of the Pd(0) compounds stabilized with<br>
unsaturated hydrocarbon ligands.<br>
Numerous Pd(0) complexes with unsaturated compounds in<br>
the ligands sphere are known and are described, for<br>
example, in Wilkinson, Abel "Comprehensive<br>
Organometallic Chemistry", Vol. 6, p. 243ff "Complexes<br>
of Palladium(0)".<br>
Pd(0) compounds stabilized by unsaturated hydrocarbons<br>
may be differentiated according to the ligands into<br>
complexes stabilized by monodentate and by multidentate<br>
(chelating) ligands. An example of a Pd(0) complex<br>
stabilized by monodentate hydrocarbon ligands is<br>
Pd(ethylene)3, which decomposes at room temperature and<br>
under air.<br>
Stabler Pd(0) compounds are obtained by chelating, for<br>
example bidentate, unsaturated hydrocarbon ligands such<br>
as dienes. Dienes are classified according to the<br>
separation of the two diene functions into 1,4-diene<br>
ligands, 1,5-diene ligands, 1,6-diene ligands,<br>
1,7-diene ligands, etc.<br>
1,4-Diene-stabilized palladium(O) finds wide use as a<br>
ligand, for example, in the form of 1,5-diphenyl-1,4-<br>
pentadien-3-one (dba). One description of the synthesis<br><br>
is given by M.F. Rettig et al. in Inorg. Synth., 1990,<br>
28. The product is isolated from the synthesis solution<br>
as a sparingly soluble precipitate. The solid is<br>
substantially air-stable, but solutions in organic<br>
solvents of these compounds decompose within hours<br>
(STREM catalogue: "Chemicals for research", Catalogue<br>
No. 19, 2001-2003) .<br>
The use of this complex type as a precursor in<br>
homogeneous catalysis is described, for example, in<br>
US-B-6,316,380. In EP-A-508 264, Pd(dba)2 substituted<br>
by sulphoalkyl groups is used as homogeneous catalyst<br>
in C-C coupling.<br>
A known example of Pd(0) stabilized by 1,5-diene ligand<br>
is Pd(COD)2. This is synthesized in DE-A-25 55 374 from<br>
Pd(COD)Cl2 in the presence of an organometallic<br>
compound, for example Li2(COT) (COT = cyclooctatraene),<br>
sodium naphthalide or organoaluminium compounds, in<br>
solvents having no active protons. The above patent<br>
application also describes the synthesis of Pd(C2H4)3<br>
from Pd(COD)2. Pd(COD)2 is an unstable solid which<br>
decomposes within hours under atmospheric conditions.<br>
This property makes this compound industrially<br>
utilizable only to a limited extent.<br>
J. Krause, G. Cestaric, K.-J. Haack, K. Seevogel, W.<br>
Storm, K.R. Porschke (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999, 121,<br>
9807-9823 and Chem. Commun. 1998, 12, 1291) describe<br>
the synthesis of molecularly defined hepta-1,6-diene-,<br>
diallyl ether- and tetramethyldivinyldisiloxane-<br>
palladium(0), which are examples of Pd(0) stabilized by<br>
1,6-diene ligands. The synthesis follows substantially<br>
the route described for Pd(COD)2. Oxygen-free solvents<br>
have to be used for the synthesis and the materials<br>
have decomposition temperatures close to room<br><br>
temperature .<br>
For application in homogeneous catalysis, 1,6-diene-<br>
Pd(0)-phosphine and -carbene complexes have been<br>
identified. These compounds exhibit high activities in<br>
the industrially used Heck reaction and the Suzuki C-C<br>
coupling reaction, and are described by M.G. Andreu, A.<br>
Zapf, M. Beller in Chem. Comm., 2000, 245 and in<br>
DE-A-100 62 577.<br>
In the prior art, 1,4-diene-stabilized Pd(0) compounds<br>
are used industrially. These exhibit sufficient<br>
stability, but solutions of these compounds are not<br>
storage-stable. 1,5- and 1,6-diene-stabilized Pd(0)<br>
compounds are distinctly less stable than the<br>
1,4-diene-stabilized Pd(0) compounds. In all diene-<br>
stabilized Pd(0) compounds, it is typically necessary<br>
to work under inert gas and with dried solvents having<br>
no active protons in order to isolate molecularly<br>
defined Pd2(diene)3 or Pd(diene)2 compounds. In<br>
addition, highly sensitive organolithium compounds<br>
which pose potential health risks are used in the<br>
synthesis, which makes industrial-scale utilization<br>
costly and inconvenient. For this reason, these<br>
compound classes have not been used industrially on a<br>
large scale to date.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to<br>
provide a novel inexpensive process for preparing<br>
palladium(0) compounds. Solutions of these compounds<br>
should be substantially stable thermally and toward<br>
atmospheric conditions. This enables access to<br>
economically viable, versatile, novel precursors for<br>
applications in homogeneous catalysis, heterogeneous<br>
catalysis and complex chemistry.<br><br>

preparing a Palladium(0) compound, comprising reaction<br>

in which R is a hydrogen atom, a substituted or<br>

comprising reaction of a palladium compound with one or<br>
more compounds of the general formula III in the<br>
presence of a base:<br>
Term-O-{ [Si (R16) (CR19CR17R18) 0] v [Si (R20)2O] w}-Term (III)<br>
in which<br>
v and w are each independently 0 or an integer of from<br>
1 to 1000 and v+w is from 0 to 1000,<br>
each R16 is independently selected from a hydrogen atom,<br>

Surprisingly, the above-described processes, unlike the<br>
processes known to date, can be carried out at<br>
temperatures above 0°C. In addition, the reaction does<br>
not have to be carried out with exclusion of air or<br>
with dried solvents.<br>
In the palladium(O) compounds, palladium is present as<br>
palladium(0). The oxidation state of palladium in the<br>
compounds can be determined by known processes, for<br>
example by reacting with uncharged ligands (for example<br><br>
phosphines) , isolating and characterizing the resulting<br>
compound with NMR, or by concentrating the solution by<br>
evaporation and determining the oxidation state by<br>
means of XPS.<br>

The palladium compound used as the starting compound is<br>
not particularly restricted. It may be used either in<br>
the form of solids or in the form of aqueous or<br>
hydrochloric acid solutions. Preference is given to<br>

+4 oxidation state. Examples thereof are PdX2, PdX4,<br>
M2PdX4, M2PdX6, (NH3)2PdX2 and [Pd(NH3)4]X2, where M is a<br>

with the carbon atoms bonded thereto may be a<br>
constituent of a 5- to 7-membered, optionally<br>
heteroatom-containing ring.<br>
Examples of heteroatom-containing rings are rings which<br>
derive from the following structures: thiophenes,<br>

preferably perhalogenated.<br>
The compounds of the formula I are preferably<br>

tetravinyl-1,3,5,7-tetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane and<br>
1,3,5-trimethyl-l,3,5-trivinylcyclotrisiloxane.<br>
It goes without saying that the palladium compound can<br>
be reacted with mixtures of the compounds of the<br>
general formula I, II and III. In the reaction of the<br>
palladium compound with one or more of the compounds of<br>
the general formula I, II and III, preference is given<br>
to no further ligands in addition to the compounds of<br>
the general formula I, II and III during the reaction.<br>
Base<br>
The palladium compound is reacted with one or more<br>
compounds of the general formula I, II or III in the<br>
presence of a base. In the context of the invention,<br><br>
"base" refers to inorganic and organic (preferably<br>
inorganic) bases, but not organometallic bases. The<br>
bases should not decompose in water. Suitable bases<br>
are, for example, salts of Br0nsted acids. Preference<br>
is given to using carbonates, hydrogencarbonates,<br>
acetates, formates, ascorbates, oxalates and<br>
hydroxides. These may be used in the form of their<br>
ammonium (NR4+ where R = H or C1-4-alkyl) , alkali metal<br>
(for example sodium or potassium) and alkaline earth<br>
metal salts.<br>
Solvent<br>
The components are reacted typically in a solvent. The<br>
solvents are not particularly restricted. Examples of<br>
possible solvents are water, alcohols, hydrocarbons<br>
(e.g. aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene and toluene<br>
or aliphatic hydrocarbons such as pentane, hexane and<br>
heptane), open-chain or cyclic ethers, amides and<br>
esters. However, preference is given to water, C1-6<br>
alcohols (e.g. C1-4 alcohols such as methanol, ethanol,<br>
propanol and butanol) and C2-6 ethers as solvents.<br>
Mixtures of these solvents may likewise be used.<br>
Reducing agent<br>
In order to accelerate the reaction or achieve very<br>
substantial conversion, the reaction may optionally be<br>
effected in the presence of a reducing agent. Suitable<br>
reducing agents are those which, compared to the<br>
palladium compound used, have a lower redox potential<br>
under the selected reaction conditions. For example,<br>
formic acid and salts thereof, oxalic acid and salts<br><br>
thereof, hydrazine, glucose, ascorbic acid or<br>
formaldehyde can be used. Instead of using a separate<br>
reducing agent, it is likewise possible to use a<br>
solvent which has reducing properties.<br>
Performance of the process<br>
In one possible embodiment of the process according to<br>
the invention, the palladium compound and the compound<br>
of the general formula I, II or III is preferably<br>
dissolved in a solvent and the base is suspended in the<br>
solution. The reactants are reacted with one another.<br>
To this end, the reactants are introduced into a<br>
reactor and stirred. The reaction may be effected at a<br>
temperature of -78°C to +200°C, preferably of -10°C to<br>
+100°C and more preferably of 0°C to +50°C. The<br>
pressure is generally 0.1 mbar to 100 bar, preferably<br>
0.2 to 2 bar. Particular preference is given to ambient<br>
pressure ±0.2 bar. The reaction time is commonly<br>
5 minutes to 1 week, preferably 5 minutes to 24 hours,<br>
more preferably 30 minutes to 24 hours. As mentioned<br>
above, it is not necessary to work with exclusion of<br>
air, which is particularly advantageous for the<br>
industrial-scale application of the process according<br>
to the invention.<br>
Based on 1 equivalent of palladium in the form of the<br>
compound used, 1 to 100 equivalents, preferably 3 to<br>
100 equivalents, more preferably 8 to 20 equivalents,<br>
of the compound of the general formula I, II or III are<br>
used. The base is used in an amount of 1 to<br>
100 equivalents preferably of 2 to 100 equivalents,<br>
more preferably of 2.5 to 10 equivalents, based on<br>
1 equivalent of palladium. If present, the reducing<br><br>
agent may be added in an amount of 1 to 100 equivalents<br>
based on 1 equivalent of palladium. Instead of using a<br>
separate reducing agent, it. is likewise possible to use<br>
a solvent which has reducing properties. In this case,<br>
the amount of the reducing agent (solvent) is not<br>
particularly restricted, but rather it can be used in<br>
any excess based on 1 equivalent of palladium.<br>
The palladium (0) compounds may be used as such after<br>
the reaction. However, it is possible to purify and/or<br>
to concentrate the solutions before use. Useful<br>
purification steps are, for example, the filtering-off<br>
of by-products, the drying of the solution (for example<br>
over molecular sieves or MgSO4) or the purification<br>
over activated carbon. The solution may be<br>
concentrated, for example, by distillation.<br>
The palladium(0) compounds prepared by the process<br>
according to the invention are also storage-stable and<br>
can be handled under air, generally at temperatures up<br>
to 30°C, in some cases up to 60°C and higher. They<br>
typically have a metal content of 0.01% by weight to<br>
40% by weight, preferably of 0.01% by weight to 30% by<br>
weight, more preferably of 0.01% by weight to 20% by<br>
weight, and a total halogen content of not more than 5%<br>
by weight, preferably not more than 2% by weight, more<br>
preferably not more than 1% by weight.<br>
The palladium(O) compounds may, either alone or as a<br>
mixture, be used as a precursor for catalysts for<br>
organic chemistry reactions, by mixing them with a<br>
ligand, for example phosphines, phosphites,<br>
phosphonites, amines, alkenes, thioethers, alkynes or<br>
carbenes, each of which may also be generated in situ.<br>
This mixture may be used directly as a catalyst, or the<br><br>
resulting complex may be obtained in substance by<br>
customary processes from the mixture.<br>
The inventive palladium(0) compounds may, either alone<br>
or as a mixture, also be used directly without using<br>
additional ligands as a catalyst precursor in organic<br>
chemistry reactions.<br>
The examples which follow are intended to further<br>
illustrate the invention. However, the invention is not<br>
restricted to these illustrative embodiments, but<br>
rather is defined by the claims.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
General method for the synthesis of palladium(0)<br>
compounds<br>
One equivalent of sodium tetrachloropalladate was<br>
dissolved in methanol. To this solution were added<br>
8 equivalents of sodium hydrogencarbonate and<br>
10 equivalents of a compound of the general formula I.<br>
The solution was stirred for 4 hours. The methanol was<br>
distilled off and the residue stirred over a desiccant<br>
and activated carbon. The solids were filtered off and<br>
the filtrate was concentrated by distillation.<br>
Depending on the distillation conditions, stable<br>
palladium solutions having palladium contents of 0.01<br>
to 20% by weight were obtained.<br>
According to this method, reaction mixtures were<br>
prepared with the di- to tetraenes specified in<br>

The palladium and chlorine content was determined by<br>
means of ICP-OES after digestion or by wickbold<br>
