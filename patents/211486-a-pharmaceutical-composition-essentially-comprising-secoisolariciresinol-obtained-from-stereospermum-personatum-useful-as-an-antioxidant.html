				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to the isolation of compound namely (-)-Secoisolariciresinol from a<br>
new plant source Stereospermum personatum. The compound (-)-Secoisolariciresinol<br>
{2,3 Bis - [4-hydroxy-3- (methoxyphenyl) methyl]-1,4-butanediol} is isolated from new<br>
source in good yield.<br>
It is proved to be useful and better antioxidant molecule than the presently used<br>
medicinally important lipophilic antioxidants Prubucol and a-Tocopherol. It may have<br>
better therapeutic potential in inflammatory disease conditions, atherosclerosis, diabetic<br>
complications, cancer, hepatotoxicity and variety of disease conditions mediated through<br>
or fostered by oxidative stress and / or overt oxidative burden due to increased generation<br>
or under scavenging of free radicals.<br>
Background and Prior Art References<br>
There is a considerable amount of epidemiological evidence indicating association<br>
between diet rich in fruits and vegetables and a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease<br>
and certain forms of cancer. It is generally assumed that the active principles contributing<br>
to these protective effects are nothing but primarily, the antioxidant phytochemicals.<br>
Research in the past decades have accumulated enough evidence to show the beneficial<br>
effect of free-radical scavengers/antioxidants as antimutagenic, anti-inflammatory,<br>
antiamerosclerotic, antidiabetic, antihepatotoxic, antiageing and in a variety of<br>
neurological disorders. The search for new antioxidant principles is becoming therefore,<br>
essential to improve the pharmacological treatment of pathological conditions such as<br>
cataract, rheumatic diseases, atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and other<br>
neurodegenarative conditions.<br>
The pharmacological approaches therefore have focused on the search of potential<br>
resources rich in with antioxidant principles. The medicinal importance of plants bearing<br>
rich proportion of antioxidant principles is therefore becoming hot item.<br>
Stereospermum personatum is a medicinal plant used in traditional Indian System of<br>
Medicine and is widely advocated in the preparations for diuretic, lithontriptic,<br>
expectorant, cardiotonic, aphrodisiac, appetizer, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial.<br>
dyspepsia, diarrhea, renal and vesical calculi, cough, asthma, hyperdipsia, haemorrhoids<br>
and hyperacidity disease conditions ( Indian Medicinal Plants, Vol 5 p 192). It is further<br>
reported to possess antibacterial, antifungal, hypoglycemic activity, and against p388<br>
lymphocytic leukemic cells ( Ind. Jour, of Exp. Biol., 1971,9, 100). Hence, it becomes<br>
pertinent to look for the molecules possessing such important biological properties. In this<br>
connection, the phytochemical investigation of Stereospermum personatum has been taken<br>
up. The applicants have isolated (-)-Secoisolariciresinol in good yields. (-)-<br>
Secoisolariciresinol is known to possess several activities, which are shown in Table 1.<br>

The invention is further described in the following examples that are given by the way of<br>
illustration and therefore should not be construed to limit the invention in any manner.<br>
Example-1<br>
Experimental protocol: A process for the isolation of above lignans.<br>
The dried wood powder of Stereospermum personatum (3 Kg) was loaded on a Soxhlet<br>
apparatus. The powder was first extracted with hexane. The residue from the extraction of<br>
hexane was further extracted with chloroform. The chloroform solution was concentrated<br>
under vacuum. The dark brown extract (22 g) was adsorbed on silica gel (60-120 mesh)<br>
and loaded on silica gel (60-120 mesh) column. (4 cm dia to a height of 100 cms).<br>
The column is subjected to elution with chloroform-methanol gradient. The chloroformmethanol<br>
gradient is so selected to obtain specific fraction and thereby the desired<br>
compound. In the present case, the fractions eluted at 3% methanol in chloroform are<br>
collected separately and concentrated.<br>
The above fractions are subjected to further purification using silica gel column<br>
( &gt;200mesh, 2.5 cm dia and 50 cm length) using chloroform-methanol gradient. The<br>
eluent at 3% methanol in chloroform gave pure (-)-Secoisolariciresinol (0.9 g). The<br>
