The spring back feature of the walls of the Container makes it easy for empty return transportation in a compressed and packed state, thus saving space. The Container can be used for all weather applications, the walls of which resistant to chemicals, oils and other corrosive environments. The material used m the manufacture of Springback Container, flexible PVC coated polyester/nylon reinforced sheets is used for the first time in the manufacture of transportable containers. The use of specially prepared multi-layer sheets bonded with specially formulated adhesive provides the Container the structural strength to withstand the rigors of shipment and transportation. TheContainer does not require any outer structural packaging support for shipment or transportation. Springback Container is water tight, can be transported, as identifiable and independent container The Container is reusable and repairable, giving long life service.<br>
Closing Means of the Springback Container offers the best safety locking means that make the Container stand out fi-om all the unsafe and transporting flexible containers now in general use. Springback Container offers simple and best security transportation like any other heavy-duty bulk cargo containers, but with more mobility and flexibility.<br>
The Container is custom made to store or transport the contents as small as IKg and over. The Container can be also used as knap sack, for small quantities 30Kgs.The Container can be custom manufactured to any higher capacity carrying. The Container can be used as identifiable, independent container with suitable provisions for addresses of origin and destination, contents' weight details, for specific freight transportation purposes.<br>
The Holder handles provided is capable for both manual and lifting devices handling of the Container. The Container is so flexible and can be converted in to rigid shape for specific uses with the help of wall holding inside supports and insulating blocks for specific fragile materials transportation and dismantled when the use is over and return to its original shape.<br>
There is no specific prior specification available in logistics or freight transportation, to compare with the features similar to the Flexible Springback Container Assembly with^losing Means. There is no transportable or storage container presently in use, having the spring back and the safety locking features as offered by this product. Only heavy-duty rigid freight transport bulk containers used to provide the secure locking features. The system of locking used in the Springback Container is entirely different from the system used in the rigid bulk containers.<br><br>
Intermediate Bulk Containers presently in use, are of single or of composite construction. Containers of single construction material are generally of rigid nature. Containers of composite construction will have inner receptacle of rigid material and outer material for structural packaging. If flexible materials are to be used as inner receptacle, it is necessary to have a strong structural outer packaging for transportation support.<br>
Flexible Intermediate Bulk Containers, the Jumbo Bags, generally used in transportation of materials, are made of polypropylene materials, stitched and sewn, which cannot stand for reuse as many times as that offered by the Springback Container. They can only be transported inside the Rigid Containers and does not provide identifiable and independent features.<br>
Blow Molded Plastic Container, is another flexible Bulk Container used for hazardous chemicals transportation but they require structural outer packaging hardware support in transportation. Their main use is only fill and transport and does not have any secure locking system in place. They are inflexible for return transportation.<br>
Fiber Drum Containers is another type used in the powder material transportation. They are rigid drums with seal locking .If once broken to open the contacts, the Container loses its locking capability for further reuse for the same purpose. For transportation of packets, documents etc.. Hard Card Board Boxes are used which are susceptible to weather conditions and they do not have proper and secure locking mechanism. They need to be stacked in clean dry envirormient and gets damaged easily under moist conditions.<br>
Safety closing means will not be suitable and employable for these types intermediate bulk containers. Their closing mechanism generally is in the form of caps, lids, valves, or tying. The holder handles or the handling mechanism provided in these flexible containers would be suitable only to one mode of handling i.e. either for manual or for lifting devices. The Containers made suitable to one mode manual handling may not be suitable for lifting devices handling and vice versa. Comparing to the features of these Containers mentioned above, Springback Container has best and efficient unique safety locking features, water tight, all weather proof, capable of both manual and lifting machine handling, independently transportable reusable giving long life service.<br>
No claim is made for the primary technical specifications of the Flexible PVC sheet used in the manufacture of the Springback Container, which is procured fi"om the original manufactures, or primary specifications of other hardware items components that may be used in the assembling of the Container .The claim is on the novel product made out these materials with altogether innovative and different from existing features used in the transportation and storage solutions in general.<br><br><br>
