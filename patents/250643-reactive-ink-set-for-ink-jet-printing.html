				<td>CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
 The present application is related to U.S. Application Serial Number (unknown).<br>
 Attorney Docket Number 10980131, entitled "Multi-Chamber Ink Supply," by <br>
Askeland, assigned to same assignee as the present invention, and filed herewith. <br>
(FIELD OF INVENTION )<br>
The present invention relates to reactive inks employed in ink-jet printing and,<br>
more particularly, to reactive ink sets having a non-reactive subset.<br>
( BACKGROUND OF INVENTION )<br>
Ink-jet printing is a non-impact printing process in which droplets of ink are<br>
deposited on a print medium in a particular order to form alphanumeric characters,<br>
area-fills, and other patterns thereon. Low cost and high quality of the hardcopy<br>
output, combined with relatively noise-free operation, have made ink-jet printers a<br>
popular alternative to other types of printers used with computers.<br>
The non-impact printing process of ink-jet printing involves the ejection of fine<br>
droplets of ink onto a print medium such as paper, transparency film, or textiles in<br>
response to electrical signals generated by a microprocessor. There are two basic<br>
means currently available for achieving ink droplet ejection in ink-jet printing:<br>
thermally and piezoelectrically. In thermal ink-jet printing, the energy for drop<br>
ejection is generated by electrically heated resistor elements, which heat up rapidly in<br>
response to electrical signals from a microprocessor to create a vapor bubble, resulting<br>
in the expulsion of ink through nozzles associated with the resistor elements. In<br>
piezoelectric ink-jet printing, the ink droplets are ejected due to the vibrations of<br>
piezoelectric crystals, again, in response to electrical signals generated by the<br>
microprocessor.<br><br>
In thermal ink-jet printing, an ink-jet image is formed when a precise pattern of<br>
dots is ejected from a drop generating device known as a "printhead" onto a printing<br>
medium. The typical ink-jet printhead has an array of precisely formed nozzles (or<br>
ejector portions) attached to a thermal ink-jet printhead substrate, such as silicon,<br><br>
nickel, or polyimide, or a combination thereof. The substrate incorporates an array of<br>
firing chambers or drop ejector portions that receive liquid ink (colorants dissolved or<br>
dispersed in a solvent) through fluid communication with one or more ink reservoir.<br>
Each firing chamber has a thin-film resistor, known as a "firing resistor," located<br>
opposite the nozzle so ink can collect between the firing resistor and the nozzle. The<br>
printhead is mounted on a carriage that travels along the width of the printer<br>
(otherwise the "scan axis").<br>
Commercially-available thermal ink-jet printers, such as DeskJetÂ® printers<br>
available from Hewlett-Packard Company, use inks of differing hues, namely,<br>
magenta, yellow, and cyan, and optionally black. The particular set of colorants, e.g.,<br>
dyes, used to make the inks is called a "primary dye set." A spectrum of colors, e.g.,<br>
secondary colors, can be generated using different combinations of the primary dye<br>
set.<br>
One category of ink-jet printers utilizes disposable printheads in which the ink<br>
reservoirs are on-board the carriage, thus the term on-board or on-axis. The reservoirs<br>
can be formed integrally with the printhead portions or they can be detachably<br>
connected thereto.<br>
Another category of ink-jet printers employs ink reservoirs that are not located on<br>
the carriage, thus the term off-board or off-axis. In one case, the reservoir<br>
intermittently replenishes the printhead with ink when the printhead travels to a<br>
stationary reservoir periodically for replenishment. Another type makes use of a<br>
replaceable ink reservoir connected to the printhead by a fluid conduit. The printhead<br>
is replenished with ink through this fluid conduit.<br><br>
The reservoirs may be individually (separate from other reservoirs) replaceable or<br>
the reservoirs can be formed as one integral reservoir portion, to be replaced as a unit.<br>
Different printhead / ink reservoir configurations address different customer<br>
needs. For example, on-board designs provide for ease of use. Printers using the off-<br>
board designs provide for less interruptions during printing jobs which require larger<br>
ink volumes, such as large format printing.<br>
In general, a successful ink set for color ink-jet printing should have the<br>
following properties: good crusting resistance, good stability, the proper viscosity, the<br>
proper surface tension, good color-to-color bleed alleviation, rapid dry time, no<br>
negative reaction with the vehicle, consumer-safety, and low strike-through. When<br>
placed into a thermal ink-jet system, the ink set should also be kogation-resistant.<br>
Furthermore, the successful ink set should be robust enough to provide flexibility in<br>
the design and configuration of the ink-jet print cartridge.<br>
Regardless of whether an ink is dye-based or pigment-based, ink-jet inks<br>
commonly face the challenge of color-to-color or black-to-color bleed control. The<br>
term "bleed" as used herein, is defined to be the invasion of one color into another,<br>
once the ink is deposited on the print medium, as evidenced by a ragged border<br>
therebetween. Bleed occurs as colors mix both on the surface of the paper substrate as<br>
well as within the substrate itself. The occurrence of bleed is especially problematic<br>
between a black ink and an adjacently-printed color ink because it is all the more<br>
visible. Hence, to achieve good print quality, bleed should be substantially reduced or<br>
eliminated such that borders between colors are clean and free from the invasion of<br>
one color into the other.<br>
One approach used for controlling bleed between the printed images, as disclosed<br>
in U.S. patent NO 5,428,383, entitled "Method and Apparatus for Preventing Color<br><br>
Bleed in a Multi-Ink Printing System," filed by Shields et al., and assigned to the<br>
same assignee as the present invention, and incorporated herein by reference, is to<br>
employ a precipitating agent (e.g., a multi-valent metal salt) in one ink, and a colorant,<br>
preferably in the form of an organic dye having at least one and preferably two or<br>
more carboxyl and/or carboxylate groups, in another ink, preferably the black ink.<br>
When the inks are printed on the printing medium adjacent one another, the ink<br>
containing the precipitating agent brings about the precipitation of the colorant with<br>
the carboxyl/carboxylate group, thereby preventing the migration of the colorant in<br>
the other ink, thereby reducing bleed between the two adjacently printed areas.<br>
Another method of reducing bleed between ink-jet inks involves the use of pH-<br>
sensitive dyes as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,181,045 entitled "Bleed Alleviation<br>
Using pH-sensitive Dyes/Inks," filed by Shields et al, and assigned to the same<br>
assignee as the present invention, and incorporated herein by reference. It disclosed<br>
therein that an ink having a pH-sensitive dye, the "pH-sensitive ink," would be<br>
prevented from bleeding into an adjacent ink having an appropriate pH, the "target<br>
ink". More particularly, migration of the ink having the pH-sensitive dye is prevented<br>
by rendering the dye insoluble on the page by contact with the adjacent ink having the<br>
appropriate pH. Thus, bleed is reduced or eliminated by using both the "pH-<br>
sensitive" ink as well as the "target" ink. Typically, since the invasion of a black dye<br>
into a color ink is more problematic than vice versa because of its greater visibility,<br>
the black ink would employ the pH-sensitive dye and the pH of the color ink would be<br>
controlled in the practice of the invention, such that the black ink would be prevented<br>
from bleeding into the color ink. The method of U.S. Patent No. 5,181,045 requires a<br>
pH differential of about 4 (or even 5) units to completely control bleed.<br>
U.S. Application No. 08/567974, entitled "Bleed Alleviation in Ink-Jet Inks using<br>
Organic Acids," filed by Adamic et al. on December 6, 1995, and assigned to the<br>
same assignee as the present invention) and U.S. Patent 5.679J43 (entitled "Bleed<br>
Alleviation in Ink-jet Inks Using Acids Containing a Basic Functional Group," filed<br><br>
by Looman and assigned to the same assignee as the present invention), both<br>
incorporated herein by reference, further disclose methods for controlling bleed by<br>
forcing the precipitation of a pH-sensitive dye in one ink (the pH-sensitive ink) on the<br>
print medium by contacting the pH-sensitive dye with a second ink (the target ink)<br>
having an appropriate pH (either higher or lower than the first ink). Upon contact on<br>
the print medium, the pH-sensitive dye of me first ink becomes insoluble, thus<br>
bleeding less. U.S. Application 08/567974 discloses the use of organic acids to<br>
reduce the pH differential required to effect precipitation of a pH-sensitive dye<br>
colorant as compared to that disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,181,045, described above.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,679,143 employs the use of an organic acid having no basic functional<br>
groups and a pH adjusting organic compound containing both acidic and basic<br>
functional groups, specifically, at least one acidic functional group and at least one<br>
basic functional group, where the number of basic functional groups is the same as or<br>
greater than the number of acidic functional groups. The presence of the organic acid<br>
in the ink-jet ink composition reduces the pH differential required to render insoluble<br>
the pH-sensitive colorant of a second encroaching ink-jet ink composition, as<br>
described in U.S. Application No. 08/567974 above. The presence of the dual-<br>
function pH adjusting compound further increases the concentration of an acid<br>
functional group in the ink-jet ink composition while also increasing the pH of the<br>
ink-jet ink composition to acceptable levels. Therefore, the dual-function pH<br>
adjusting compound augments the bleed alleviation achieved by ah organic acid alone<br>
according to the mechanism disclosed in Serial No. 08/567974.<br>
In order to prevent the occurrence of bleed between the primary (e.g., cyan,<br>
magenta, and yellow) and secondary colors (e.g., red, blue, and green) with black, all<br>
the three primary colors are designed to be reactive with the black ink according to<br>
reaction mechanisms such as those described above (multi-valent metal salt, pH-<br>
sensitive dye.<br><br>
The above solutions, although of merit, do not maximize flexibility in the design<br>
of the inks and printing systems in which they are used. For example, using reactive<br>
ink systems may lead to unwanted mixing of the reactive inks, hence contributing to<br>
reliability problems in the printing system, particularly in compact printhead<br>
arrangements or compact ink delivery arrangements.<br>
Therefore, a need exists for a reactive ink set that can utilize the advantages of<br>
reactive inks while allowing flexibility in the design of the inks and the architecture of<br>
the ink-jet printing systems in which they are used.<br>
(DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION)<br>
In accordance with the invention, an ink set and method for printing using the <br>
same are disclosed, the ink set comprising inks comprising an aqueous vehicle and a<br>
colorant, the ink set comprising at least two mutually reactive inks; and an ink non- <br>
reactive with the at least two mutually reactive inks. The present ink set utilizes the<br>
advantages of reactive inks while allowing flexibility in the design of the inks and the<br>
architecture of the ink-jet printing systems in which they are used.<br>

(DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION)<br>
DEFINITIONS<br>
Reactive ink - An ink that has an ingredient reactive with an ingredient in another<br>
ink thus providing for enhanced properties, such as, reducing bleed between the<br>
reactive ink and the other ink in the event that the reactive ink and the other ink are<br>
adjacently printed on a print medium.<br><br>
Mutually reactive inks - Inks that are reactive with one another.<br>
Non-reactive ink - An ink that is non-reactive with a mutually reactive ink.<br>
Integral Printhead - A printhead having an array of drop ejector portions that are<br>
permanently attached to a rigid structure. Ejector portions are fabricated from<br>
materials including silicon, nickel, polyimide, or a combination thereof. Such<br>
techniques of forming a monolithic printhead are known in the art and are discussed in<br>
publication such as U.S. Patent Numbers 4,438,191 and 4,922,265, both assigned to<br>
the assignee of the present invention.<br>
Integral Print Cartridge - An ink jet printhead portion, and; at least one reservoir<br>
chamber, or an integral reservoir portion; forming an integral print cartridge.<br><br>
On-board (on-axis) - A category of ink-jet printers utilizing disposable printheads<br>
in which the ink reservoirs are on-board the carriage. The reservoirs can be formed<br>
integrally with the printhead portion or detachably connected thereto.<br>
Off-board (off-axis) - A category of ink-jet printers employing ink reservoirs that<br>
are not located on the carriage. In one case, the reservoir intermittently replenishes<br>
the printhead with ink when the printhead travels to a stationary reservoir periodically<br>
for replenishment. Another type makes use of a replaceable ink reservoir connected<br>
to the printhead by a fluid conduit. The printhead is replenished with ink through this<br>
fluid conduit.<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
The present ink set comprises at least two mutually reactive inks and an ink non-<br>
reactive with the at least two mutually reactive inks. In the preferred embodiment, the<br>
ink set comprises at least four inks, each of the inks comprising an aqueous vehicle,<br>
and a colorant. In accordance with the invention, a first ink is reactive with a second<br>
ink, and is non-reactive with a third ink. Preferably, the first ink is reactive with also<br>
a fourth ink. More preferably, the first and third inks are black and cyan, respectively,<br>
and the second ink is selected from the group consisting of magenta and yellow. Most<br>
preferably the second ink is magenta and the fourth ink is yellow. It should be<br>
appreciated by those skilled in the art, that the present invention is not limited to a<br>
fixed number of inks and that, more or less inks, inks having same or different<br>
colorants, and inks having different colorant concentrations may be used in the ink<br>
set.<br>
The present invention can be employed in any reactive system where the first ink is<br>
designed to be reactive with the second, and optionally, the fourth inks regardless of<br>
the purpose for the reaction. The reaction can serve to enhance any one of a number<br>
of print system attributes such as bleed alleviation, smearfastness, improved dry time,<br>
or any other desirable attribute.<br><br>
For illustrative purposes only, unless stated otherwise, black, magenta, cyan, and<br>
yellow, will be used to refer to the first through fourth inks; and "bleed" will be used<br>
to describe the effects of the reaction between the inks.<br>
It is not uncommon for inks to puddle on the nozzle plate of the ink-jet printhead.<br>
This puddling, in turn, may lead to the mixing of the inks, for example during the<br>
wiping process. This mixing of the inks, especially when reactive inks are used in<br>
association with an integral printhead, may result in reliability problems in the firing<br>
chambers. Therefore, when using the reactive ink approaches such as those described<br>
above (or any other reactive approach for that matter), it is preferable to separate the<br>
ejector portions associated with the sensitive ink, e.g., black; and the target inks, e.g.,<br>
color inks; from one another. Using this approach, the color inks may all use the<br>
same integral printhead or separate integral printheads. But either way, the black ink<br>
is associated with a separate integral printhead to prevent the mixing of the inks on the<br>
same nozzle plate. This approach although of great merit does not provide the desired<br>
flexibility in the design of the ink-jet printing systems. Furthermore, the necessity of<br>
designing all color inks to be reactive with the black ink may limit the design space<br>
for formulating the color inks. The ink set of the present invention allows for<br>
flexibility in the design of the inks and the ink-jet printing systems in which they are<br>
used by using a reactive ink set wherein a subset is non-reactive.<br>
The reaction between the mutually reactive inks (e.g., first ink and the second and<br>
fourth inks) may employ any one of mechanisms well-known in the art such as, the<br>
use of a pH-sensitive colorant, or the use of a precipitating agent, as described in the<br>
aforementioned patents and applications.<br>
Ink sets employing the present invention will reduce bleed between adjacently<br>
printed areas where one area is printed with one of the mutually reactive inks (e.g.. the<br>
first ink) and the other area is printed with the other mutually reactive ink (e.g., at<br><br>
least one of the second or fourth inks). Since the third ink is non-reactive with the<br>
first ink there is no bleed control between adjacently printed areas where one area is<br>
printed with the first ink and the other area is only printed with the third ink.<br>
Therefore, it is preferred that the third ink has a color, preferably cyan, that will<br>
exhibit the least objectionable bleed when printed next to the first ink, preferably<br>
black.<br>
When using a non-reactive ink (an ink non-reactive with, for example, the black<br>
ink), e.g., non-reactive cyan, and reactive magenta and yellow inks (reactive with, for<br>
example, the black ink), black-to-color bleed would be alleviated for yellow<br>
(reactive), magenta (reactive), red (magenta + yellow), blue (cyan + magenta), and<br>
green (yellow + cyan), area-fills adjoining areas printed with the black ink because at<br>
least one of the reactive inks (for example, yellow or magenta) would be present in the<br>
colored area. However, there would be no bleed control when printing the non-<br>
reactive ink, e.g., cyan, next to black. Therefore, it may be desirable to reduce or<br>
eliminate the bleed between all colors including the first and third inks.<br>
To achieve bleed alleviation between the first and third inks, a printing method is<br>
employed (herein referred to as the under-printing method), wherein an area (herein<br>
referred to as the first area) to be printed with the first ink (e.g., black) is also, at least<br>
partially, printed with at least one ink reactive (e.g., magenta or yellow) with the first<br>
ink. The under-printing method provides the necessary immobilization of the colorant<br>
of the first ink by virtue of the reaction of an ingredient in the first ink with an<br>
ingredient in or property of the reactive ink such that the colorant of the first ink is<br>
prevented from migrating into an adjacent area printed with the non-reactive ink.<br>
Furthermore, the under-printing method may be utilized to enhance other print system<br>
attributes such as smearfastness of the first ink.<br><br>
The colorants used in the inks may be dye-based or pigment-based. As used<br>
herein, the term "pigment" refers to a colorant that is insoluble in the aqueous vehicle,<br>
and includes disperse dyes.<br>
COLORANTS<br>
The colorants employed in the inks may be either dye or pigment-based. The<br>
choice of colorants is dependent upon the particular printing application. As in the<br>
case of the colorant for the first ink, the choice of colorant further depends on the<br>
reaction mechanism of choice, for example - use of pH sensitive colorant, or the use<br>
of a precipitating agent (e.g., multi-valent metal salt), or any other suitable reaction<br>
mechanism.<br>
Examples of suitable colorants used in the first ink include organic dyes having at<br>
least one and preferably two or more carboxyl and/or carboxylate groups examples of<br>
which are listed in U.S. Patent No. 4.963.189 (filed by Hindagolla and assigned to the<br>
same assignee as the present invention, and incorporated herein by reference), and<br>
carboxylated pigment dispersions having a water insoluble colorant (e.g., pigment)<br>
dispersed with a dispersant preferably containing carboxylate solubilizing groups,<br>
such as those disclosed in U.S. Patent No 5,085,698, and U.S. Patent 5,555,008, both<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Colorants for use in the other inks, i.e., second, third, and fourth inks, are well-<br>
known in the art, and for example, as described in the aforementioned patents and<br>
applications.<br>
AQUEOUS VEHICLE<br>
The aqueous vehicle is water or a mixture of water and at least one water-soluble<br>
organic solvent, as is well-known in the art. Selection of a suitable mixture depends<br>
on requirements of the specific application, such as desired surface tension and<br>
viscosity, the selected colorant, drying time of the ink-jet ink, and the type of paper<br><br>
onto which the ink will be printed. The inks may further comprise additional<br>
ingredients such as biocides. surfactants, and the like, each of which are commonly<br>
employed additives in ink-jet printing.<br>
Depending on the reaction mechanism, the reactive inks may have additional<br>
ingredients. For example, when the reaction mechanism for reducing bleed is by<br>
precipitation of a pH-sensitive colorant in the first ink, the reactive second and fourth<br>
inks comprise an organic acid in sufficient amount to render the pH-sensitive colorant<br>
of the first ink insoluble upon contact, as disclosed in U S Patent 5,679,143 and U.S.<br>
Application 08/567974, mentioned above.<br>
Alternatively, when the reaction mechanism is based on the use of a precipitating<br>
agent, such as multi-valent metal salts, as disclosed in the aforementioned patents, the<br>
second and fourth inks contain a precipitating agent, e.g., multi-valent metal salt.<br>
PRINTING METHOD<br>
As stated above, when the ink set includes an ink non-reactive with the first ink, a<br>
printing method (the under-printing method) may be employed to reduce bleed<br>
between the first ink and the non-reactive ink or to enhance other print system<br>
attributes. In applying the method, an area (herein referred to as the first area) to be<br>
printed with the first ink (e.g., black) is also, at least partially, printed with at least one<br>
ink reactive (e.g., magenta or yellow) with the first ink, thereby minimizing the<br>
mixing of colors between the first area and a second area to be printed with the non-<br>
reactive ink.<br>
The printing method used to alleviate bleed between the first ink and the non-<br>
reactive ink using the ink set of the present invention comprises printing from an ink-<br>
jet printhead, the method comprising the steps:<br><br>
providing an ink-jet ink set comprising inks, the inks comprising an<br>
aqueous vehicle and a colorant, the ink set comprising:<br>
at least two mutually reactive inks, the at least two mutually<br>
reactive inks comprising a first and a second mutually reactive inks;<br>
an ink non-reactive with the at least two mutually reactive inks;<br>
selecting a first predetermined area on a print medium;<br>
printing at least one drop of one of the mutually reactive inks on the first<br>
predetermined print area;<br>
printing at least one drop of the other mutually reactive ink on the first<br>
print area such that the at least one drop of the other mutually reactive ink at<br>
least partially overlaps with the at least one drop of the one mutually reactive<br>
ink, thereby immobilizing the at least one drop of the first mutually reactive<br>
ink on the print medium;<br>
selecting a second predetermined print area on the print medium adjacent<br>
the first print area; and<br>
printing at least one drop of the non-reactive ink on the second<br>
predetermined print area;<br>
thereby minimizing the mixing of the at least one drop of the first<br>
mutually reactive ink with the at least one drop of the non-reactive ink on the<br>
print medium, thereby reducing bleed between the at least one drop of the first<br>
mutually reactive ink and the at least one drop of the non-reactive ink.<br>
It should be appreciated by those skilled in the art, that the immobilization of the<br>
colorant of the first ink may take place regardless of the order in which droplets of the<br>
first ink and the ink reactive with the first ink are deposited on the print medium. For<br>
example, black may be deposited first followed by the magenta or the magenta may<br>
be deposited first followed by the black. Similarly, the non-reactive ink may be<br>
deposited in any order in relation with the order of drop deposit for the mutually<br>
reactive inks, as long as the colorant of the first ink is immobilized by the second ink.<br>
For example, cyan may be deposited in the second area, followed by magenta and<br><br>
thereafter black in the first area; or the magenta and black may be deposited in the<br>
first area first followed by cyan being deposited in the second area.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
To demonstrate the effectiveness of the present invention, two ink sets were<br>
prepared. Each ink set comprised a first, second, third, and fourth ink, wherein the<br>
first ink was reactive with the second and fourth inks. In one embodiment the first,<br>
second, third, and fourth inks referred to black, magenta, cyan, and yellow inks,<br>
respectively. It is appreciated, however, that the invention is not limited to the choice<br>
of colors for each of the first through fourth inks. The first ink set was the control set,<br>
wherein theblack^ink was reactive wjth the cyan ink using the pH-sensitive colorant<br>
bleed mechanism, described above. In the control set, the black ink contained a<br>
carbon black pigment dispersed with a carboxylated dispersant (pH-sensitive colorant)<br>
and the magenta, yellow, and cyan inks (target inks) contained organic acids and had a<br>
pH sufficiently low to cause precipitation of the colorant in the black ink. The second<br>
ink set contained the same black, magenta, and yellow inks but the cyan ink did not<br>
contain the organic acid and had a pH higher than necessary for the precipitation of<br>
the colorant in the black ink, thus non-reactive with the black ink.<br>
It is, however, appreciated by one skilled in the art that the invention is not<br>
limited to pigmented inks, nor is it limited to the use of pH-sensitive mechanism as<br>
the basis of reaction between the first and third and fourth inks.<br>
Color-to-color bleed was evaluated by printing blocks of differing colors adjacent<br>
one another on plain paper, using a Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 870C printer and the<br>
corresponding single and tri-chamber print cartridges.<br>
Two groups of plots were generated for each of the two sets of inks. In each<br>
group of plots, blocks of black were printed adjacent blocks of cyan, and thereafter the<br>
printed samples were visually inspected for the unwanted migration of color from one<br><br>
block to another, particularly, migration of black into cyan. In the first group of plots,<br>
the area on the printing medium which was to receive the black ink, was first under-<br>
printed with one of the second or fourth inks. In the second group, the black ink was<br>
laid down on the printing medium without any under-printing.<br>
Figures 1(a) through 1(d) are line drawings illustrating the bleed occurring<br>
between black and cyan (represented by thin vertical lines) inks for each of the ink<br>
sets and each group of plots. Table I summarizes the results of the visual inspection of<br>
the plots for bleed performance.<br><br>
As can be seen from Figures 1(a) through 1(d) and the results in Table I, samples<br>
generated using non-reactive cyan and the under-printing method exhibited excellent<br>
bleed alleviation.<br>
The reliability of the ink sets was evaluated by measuring the effect of reactive<br>
versus non-reactive cyan on generating solid area fills. Two groups of integral tri-<br>
chamber (or tri-reservoir) print cartridges were filled with ink. In the first group,<br>
using the inks from the control ink set, reactive cyan was placed in the middle ink<br>
chamber with the outer two ink chambers filled with black ink. In the second group,<br><br>
using the inks from Ink Set 2, the middle ink chamber contained non-reactive cyan<br>
and the outer two ink chambers were filled with black ink. Print samples having<br>
black area fills were generated with each group of print cartridges. The optical<br>
density for the area fills were measured using a commercial densitometer and standard<br>
measurement procedures. The printheads were then primed during which cyan ink<br>
from the cyan ink chamber was mixed with black ink from the black ink chambers on<br>
the printhead's top plate. The same print cartridges were then used again to generate<br>
new print samples. The optical density for the "after-prime" area fills were measured.<br>
The optical density of the "before-prime" and "after-prime" samples are reported in<br>
Table II, below:<br><br>
As can be seen from the data in Table II, print cartridges having reactive cyan in<br>
the middle chamber exhibited lower optical densities after priming. The lower optical<br>
densities were due to the reactive cyan ink's reaction with the black ink and causing,<br>
at least partially, clogged nozzles associated with the black ink. The optical density<br>
obtained with print cartridges having non-reactive cyan were not affected by the<br>
priming of the print cartridges. It is desirable to have constant optical density during<br>
the life of the ink-jet print cartridges.<br><br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
The present ink set, and the printing method for reducing bleed, are expected to<br>
find commercial use in ink-jet printing.<br>
Thus, there has been disclosed an ink set and a method for ink-jet printing using<br>
the same utilizing the advantages of reactive inks while allowing flexibility in the<br>
design of the inks and the architecture of the ink-jet printing systems in which they are<br>
used. It will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes and<br>
modifications of an obvious nature may be made without departing from the spirit of<br>
