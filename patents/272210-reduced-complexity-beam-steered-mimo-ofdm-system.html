REDUCED COMPLEXITY BEAM-STEERED MIMO OFDM SYSTEM<br>
Claim of Priority under 35 U.S.C. §119<br>
[0001] The present Application for Patent claims priority to Provisional Application No. 60/794,615 entitled "REDUCED COMPLEXITY STEERED MIMO OFDM SYSTEMS" filed April 24, 2006, and assigned to the assignee hereof and hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
I.        Field<br>
[0002] The present disclosure relates generally to communication, and more specifically to techniques for transmitting data in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system.<br>
n.      Background<br>
[0003] In a wireless communication system, a transmitter may utilize multiple (T) transmit antennas for data transmission to a receiver equipped with multiple (R) receive antennas. The multiple transmit and receive antennas form a MIMO channel that may be used to increase throughput and/or improve reliability. For example, the transmitter may transmit up to T data streams simultaneously fi:om the T transmit antennas to improve throughput. Alternatively, the transmitter may transmit a single data stream fRom all T transmit antennas to improve reception by the receiver. [0004] Good performance (e.g., high throughput) may be achieved by transmitting data on the eigenmodes of the MIMO channel. The eigenmodes may be viewed as orthogonal spatial channels. To transmit data on the eigenmodes, the transmitter obtains a transmit steering matrix, which is derived based on a MIMO channel response matrix, and performs spatial processing with the transmit steering matrix. [0005] The system may have multiple subcarriers that may be lised for data transmission. To transmit data on the eigenmodes of each of the subcarriers, the transmitter may obtain a transmit steering matrix for each subcarrier and perform spatial<br>
 <br>
processing for that subcairier with the transmit steering matrix. However, deriving the transmit steering matrix for each subcarrier may require significant computational resources at the transmitter and/or receiver. Furthermore, a significant amount of radio resources may be needed to send the transmit steering matrices, or pilot signals used to derive the transmit steering matrices, from the receiver to the transmitter. [0006] There is therefore a need in the art for techniques to transmit data with less computation and feedback overhead.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0007] Techniques for transmitting data using channel information for a subset of all subcarriers used for data transmission are described herein. The techniques may provide good performance while reducing computation and feedback overhead. [0008] In an embodiment, a transmitter station receives channel information for at least one subcairier that is a subset of multiple subcarriers used for data transmission. The channel information may comprise at least one transmit steering matrix, at least one set of eigenvectors, at least one channel response matrix, or at least one channel covariance matrix for the at least one subcarrier. The channel information may also comprise an unsteered pilot or a steered pilot sent on the at least one subcarrier. In any case, the transmitter station obtains at least one transmit steering matrix for the at least one subcarrier from the charmel informatioiL The transmitter station determines a transmit steering matrix for each of the multiple subcarriers, which may be (1) set equal to the transmit steering matrix for the closest one of the at least one subcarrier or (2) derived by interpolating two or more transmit steering matrices for two or more closest subcarriers. The transmitter station performs transmit steerii' or beam-steering for each of the multiple subcarriers with the transmit steering matrix for that subcarrier. [0009] In an embodiment, a receiver station sends channel information for the at least one subcarrier to the transmitter station and receives the data transmission sent on the multiple subcarriers. The receiver station may obtain at least one channel response matrix for the at least one subcairier and decompose the at least one channel response matrix to obtain at least one transmit steering matrix, e.g., y(i) and/or U(k), which are described below. The receiver may send at least one transmit steering matrix V(k) as explicit feedback. The receiver station may also send a steered pilot on the at least<br>
 <br>
one subcarrier using at least one transmit steering matrix U(fc). The steered pilot is one form of implicit feedback. The receiver station determines transmit steering matrices for the multiple subcarriers based on the at least one transmit steering matrix in the same manner as the transmitter station. The receiver station derives spatial filter matrices for the multiple subcarriers based on the channel response matrices and the transmit steering matrices for these subcarriers. The receiver station then performs detection witib the spatial filter matrices.<br>
[0010] Various aspects and embodiments of the disclosure are described in fiirther detail below.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0022] The word "exemplary" is used herein to mean "serving as an example, instance, or illustration." Any embodiment or design described herein as "exemplary" is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments or designs.<br>
[0023] The transmission techniques described herein may be used for various wireless commimication networks such as wireless wide area networks (WWANs),<br>
 <br>
wireless metropolitan area networks (WMANs), wireless local area networks (WLANs), and so on. The terms "network" and "system" are often used interchangeably. The techniques may also be used for various multiple access schemes such as Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA), Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), Spatial Division Multiple Access (SDMA), Orthogonal FDMA (OFDMA), Single-Carrier FDMA (SC-FDMA), and so on. An OFDMA network utilizes Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). An SC-FDMA network utilizes Single-Carrier Frequency Division Multiplexing (SC-FDM). OFDM and SC-FDM partition the system bandwidth into multiple (K) orthogonal subcarriers, which are also called tones, bins, and so on. Each subcarrier may be modulated with data. In general, modulation symbols are sent in the frequency domain with OFDM and in the time domain with SC-FDM. For clarity, the transmission techniques are described below for an OFDM-based network, which may be an OFDMA network, a WLAN that implements IEEE 802.11a, 802.11g and/or 802.1 In, or some other network.<br>
[0024] FIG. 1 shows a block diagram of an embodiment of two stations 110 and 150 in a wireless communication network 100. For downlink (or forward link) transmission, station 110 may be part of, and may contain some or all of the functionality of, an access point, a base station, a Node B, and/or some other network entity. Station 150 may be part of, and may contain some or all of the functionality of, a terminal, a mobile station, a user equipment, a subscriber unit, and/or some other device. For uplink (or reverse Unk) transmission, station 110 may be part of a terminal, a mobile station, a user eqiupment, and so on, and station 150 may be part of an access point, a base station, a Node B, and so oa Station 110 is a transmitter of a data transmission and is equipped with multiple (T) antennas. Station 150 is a receiver of the data transmission and is equipped with multiple (R) antennas. Each transmit antenna and each receive antenna may be a physical antenna or an antenna array. [0025] At transmitter station 110, a transmit (TX) data processor 120 receives traffic data from a data source 112, processes (e.g., formats, encodes, interleaves, and symbol maps) the traffic data m accordance with one or more rates, and generates data symbols. As used herein, a data symbol is a symbol for data, a pilot symbol is a symbol for pilot, and a symbol is typically a complex value. The data symbols and pilot symbols may be modulation symbols from a modulation scheme such as PSK or QAM. Pilot is data that<br>
 <br>
is known a priori by both a transmitter and a receiver. A rate may indicate a data rate or information bit rate, a coding scheme or code rate, a modulation scheme, a packet size, and/or other parameters. A rate may also be referred to as a packet format, a transport format, or some other terminology. TX data processor 120 demultiplexes the data symbols into M streams, where 1 
[0027] At receiver station 150, R antennas 152a through 152r receive the T modulated signals from transmitter station 110, and each anteima 152 provides a received signal to a respective receiver (RCVR) 154. Each receiver 154 processes (e.g., filters, amplifies, downconverts, digitizes, and OFDM demodulates) its received signal, provides received data symbol to a receive (RX) spatial processor 160, and provides received pilot symbols to a chaimel processor 194. Chamiel processor 194 estimates the MIMO channel response based on the received pilot symbols and provides channel estimates to RX spatial processor 160. RX spatial processor 160 performs MIMO detection on the received data symbols with the channel estimates and provides data symbol estimates. An RX data processor 170 fiirther processes (e.g., deinterleaves and decodes) the data symbol estimates and provides decoded data to a data sink 172. [0028] Receiver station 150 may send feedback information to base station 110. The feedback information may comprise one or more rates to use for transmission, transmit steering matrices, channel quaUty indicators (CQIs), and/or other information. The feedback information is processed by a TX signaling processor 180, multiplexed with pilot symbols and spatially processed by a TX spatial processor 182, and fiirther processed by transmitters 154a through 154r to generate R modulated signals, which are transmitted via antennas 152a through 152r<br>
[0029]       At transmitter station 110, the modulated signals from receiver station 150 are received by T antennas 134a through 134t, processed by receivers 132a through<br>
 <br>
132t, spatially processed by an RX spatial processor 136, and fiirther processed by an RX signaling processor 138 to recover the feedb'k information sent by station 150. A controller/processor 140 controls the data transmission to receiver station 150 based on the feedback information. A channel processor 144 may estimate the chamiel response based on received pilot symbols and provides channel estimates, which may be used for transmit steering.<br>
[0030] ControHere/processors 140 and 190 control the operation at stations 110 and 150, respectively. Memories 142 and 192 store data and program codes for stations 110 and 150, respectively.<br>
[0031] The MIMO channel formed by the T antemias at transmitter station 110 and the R antennas at receiver station 150 may be characterized by an RxT channel response matrix H(A:) for each subcarrier k, which may be expressed as:<br>
 <br>
where entry , for i = l,...,R and y = l,...,T, is the coupling or complex gain<br>
between transmit antenna' and receive antenna / for subcarrier k. Receiver station 150 may estimate H{k) based on a pilot sent by transmitter system 110. For simplicity, the description herein assumes no error in channel estimation.<br>
(0032]       In certain  aspects, to provide directionalized transmission the channel response matrix H(k) for each subcarrier k may be diagonalized with either eigenvalue decomposition or singular value decomposition to obtain S eigenmodes of H(A), where S 
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
[0036] The diagonal elements of A{k) are eigenvalues that represent the power gains of the eigenmodes of R(fc). The eigenvalues in AXk) are the squares of the singular values in I.(k).<br>
[0037] As shown in equations (2) and (3), the columns of V(k) are right singular vectors of H(A:) as well as eigenvectors of K(k).V(k) may be referred to as a transmit steering matrix, a beamforming matrix, an eigen-steering matrix, a steering matrix, and so on. The singular value decomposition in equation (2) and eigenvalue decomposition in equation (3) may be performed using various techniques, such as with Jacobi rotation described in commonly assigned U.S. Patent AppUcation Serial No. 10/096,839, entitled "Efficient Computation for Eigenvalue Decomposition and Singular Value Decomposition of Matrices," filed March 31, 2005. [0038] Transmitter station 110 may perform transmit steering with y(fe) to send data symbols on the eigenmodes of H(A), as follows:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
x(i) is a T X1 vector with T output symbols for T antennas on subcarrier k.<br>
Transmit steering widi right singular vectors in equation (4) is also referred to as beam-steering, eigensteerii', beamforming, eigen-beamfonnii', and so on. The transmit steering in equation (4) maximizes system capacity.<br>
[0039] While the above discussion, relates to utilizing eigenvalue decomposition or singular value decomposition to determine the steering or beamforming vectors or matrices, other approaches to determining the directionality matrices, vectors, or weights may be utilized, with any of the aspects discusses herein. [0040] Receiver station 150 may perform singular value decomposition or eigenvalue decomposition independently for each data subcarrier and obtain a set of transmit steering matrices for all data subcarriers. A data subcarrier is a subcarrier usable for data transmission. Receiver station 150 may then send the set of transmit steering matrices to transmitter station 110, which may perform transmit steering for each data subcarrier with the transmit steering matrix for that subcarrier. [0041] System 100 may utilize time division duplexing (TDD), which uses a single frequency channel for both the downlink and uplink. Since one frequency channel is used for both links, the MIMO channel response for one link may be assumed to be reciprocal of the MIMO channel response for the other link. That is, if H{k) is the MIMO channel response for the link from transmitter station 110 to receiver station 150, then a reciprocal channel implies that the MIMO channel response for the link<br>
from receiver station 150 to transmitter station 110 may be given as H'(k), where " '" denotes a transpose. Channel reciprocity in the TDD system allows a channel response for one link to be estimated based on pilot sent on the other link. Thus, receiver station 150 may send a pilot to transmitter station 110, which may estimate the MIMO channel response based on the pilot from receiver station 150. Transmitter station llOmaythen perform singular value decomposition or eigenvalue decomposition to obtain a set of transmit steering matrices for all data subcarriers.<br>
[0042] In general, transmitter station 110 may obtain the transmit steering based on explicit and/or implicit feedback from receiver station 150. Explicit feedback may comprise transmit steering matrices derived by receiver station 150 based on pilot sent by transmitter station 110. Implicit feedback may comprise pilot sent by receiver station 150 and used by transmitter station 110 to derive the transmit steering matrices.<br>
 <br>
In any case, deriving a transmit steering matrix for each data subcarrier may require significant computational resources at the transmitter and/or receiver station. Furthermore, sending explicit and/or implicit feedback for each data subcarrier may require a significant amount of radio resources.<br>
[0043] An OFDM-based system is typically designed such that a wideband, frequency selective communication channel appears like multiple, narrowband, flat-fading communication channels to a receiver. The spacing between adjacent subcarriers is typically selected to assure that each subcarrier experiences flat fading. The spacing is related to, and determined by, the expected maximum channel delay spread or minimum frequency coherence. In some aspects, some frequency coherence typically exists between subcarriers and adjacent subcarriers may be correlated with respect to their channel parameters. Thus, in certain aspects a transmit steering matrix derived for one subcarrier may be iised for transmit steering of some nearby subcarriers. Significant reduction in computation and feedback overhead may be realized by reusing transmit steering matrices.<br>
[0044] In an embodiment, receiver station 110 sends channel information for only a subset of all data subcarriers. The channel information may comprise transmit steering matrices V(ft), eigenvectors or right singular vectors, channel response matrices U(k), channel covariance matrices R(k), unsteered pilot, steered pilot, and/or other channel related information. The subcarriers for which channel information is sent are referred to as designated subcarriers.<br>
[0045] FIG. 2 shows an embodiment of fixed designated subcarriers. In this embodiment, the K total subcarriers are assumed to be usable for transmission and are assigned indices of 1 through K. TTie designated subcarriers are uniformly distributed across the K subcamers and include every L-th subcarrier, or subcarriers b, L + b, 2L + b, and so on, where L &gt; 1 and b is an index of the first designated subcarrier. The uniform distribution of the designated subcamers allows for sampling of the entire system bandwidth in the fi'quency domain.<br>
[0046] In an embodiment, L is a fixed value that is selected to provide good performance for most operating environments. In an embodiment, L is equal to three, which allows the channel infonnation for a given designated subcarrier to be used for that designated subcarrier as well as data subcarriers to the left and right of the<br>
 <br>
designated subcarrier. In another embodiment, L is a configurable value that may be any positive integer value. If L = 1, then channel infonnation is sent for each data subcarrier.<br>
[0047] FIG. 3 shows an embodiment of varying designated subcarriers. In the example shown in FIG. 3, L = 3, three sets of designated subcarriers are formed, and the subcarriers in each set are staggered with respect to the subcarriers in the other two sets. The three sets may be cycled through and selected in three time intervals, as shown in FIG. 3. In general, different designated subcarriers may be selected in different time intervals, e.g., based on a predetermined pattern or a pseudo-random sequence that is known to both the transmitter and receiver. Varying the designated subcarriers allows for feedback of channel information for different subcarriers in different time intervals, which may provide diversity against frequency selective fading. [0048] FIG. 4 shows an embodiment of designated subcarriers for IEEE 802.11. IEEE 802.11 uses a subcarrier structure with K = 64 total subcarriers that are assigned indices of-31 to+32. In IEEE 802.11a/g, 52 subcarriers with indices of-26 to-1 and +1 to +26 are usable for transmission, four subcarriers with indices of-21, -7, +7 and +21 are used for carrier pilot, and the subcarrier with index of 0 is not used for transmission. In IEEE 802.nn, 56 subcarriers with indices of-28 to -1 and +1 to +28 are usable for transmission. FIG. 4 and Table 1 show exemplary designated subcarriers for different values of L. Other designated subcarriers may also be selected.<br>
 <br>
[0049] In an embodiment, the designated subcarriers are known a priori by both the transmitter and receiver stations. This embodiment avoids the need to send signaling to identify the designated subcarriers. In another embodiment, multiple sets of designated<br>
 <br>
subcarriers are defined, and one set of designated subcarriers is selected for use and identified by signaling.<br>
[0050] In an embodiment, L is configurable and determined based on channel conditions. The designated subcarriers may be selected during call setup, whenever changes in channel conditions are detected, and/or at other times. In an embodiment, receiver station 150 determines frequency selectivity of the wireless channel and selects L based on the amount of frequency selectivity. A smaller L value may be used for a wireless channel with more frequency selectivity, and a larger L value may be used for a wireless channel with less frequency selectivity.<br>
[0051J Frequency selectivity may be quantified by delay spread, which is the difference between the arrival time of the earliest signal path and the arrival time of the latest signal path at receiver station 150. Delay spread may be determined by estimating a channel impulse response, determining the earliest delay rmax and the latest delay rmax for which the channel impulse response amplitude exceeds a predetermined threshold, and deriving the delay spread as r,' - r'. Delay spread may also be determined by<br>
deriving a power delay profile, which is the power of the channel impulse response as a function of relative delay, and setting delay spread equal to the width of the power delay profile. Delay spread and delay power delay profile are described by P. A. Bello in a paper entitled "Characterization of Randomly Time-Variant Linear Channels," IEEE Trans. Communications, vol CS-11, pp 360-393, Dec 1963.<br>
[0052] Frequency selectivity may also be quantified by coherence bandwidth, which is related to the rate of change of the channel response matrices as a fimction of frequency. A frequency correlation function Q{£) may be defined as:<br>
where £ represents frequency delta and " * " denotes a complex conjugate.<br>
[0053]       Coherence bandwidth may be estimated based on the width of Q{£) as<br>
follows:<br>
<br>
 <br>
where Lc is the smallest value of for which <br>
β is a threshold value between 0 and 1, Tsam is sample duration, and BWc is the coherence bandwidth.<br>
[0054] Delay spread and coherence bandwidth may also be determined in other maimers. In general, coherence bandwidth is inversely related to delay spread. Hence, a smaUer coherence bandwidth coiresponds to a larger delay spread, and vice versa. L may be related to coherence bandwidth and inversely related to delay spread. A function or a look-up table may be defined for L versus delay spread or coherence bandwidth. A suitable L value may then be selected based on the estimated delay spread or coherence bandwidth of the wireless chaimel.<br>
[0055] Receiver station 150 may send various types of channel information to transmitter station 110. In an embodiment of explicit feedback, receiver station 150 sends an entire transmit steering matrix V(k) for each designated subcamer. In another embodiment of explicit feedback, receiver station 150 sends a partial transmit steering matrix for each designated subcarrier. In these embodiments, receiver station 150 may perform eigenvalue decomposition or singular value decomposition for each designated subcarrier, instead of each data subcarrier, which may reduce computation. Furthermore, receiver station 150 may perform decomposition for each designated subcarrier in an iterative manner, e.g., tisingjacobi rotation. Receiver station 150 may use a final solution of the transmit steering  matrix for one designated subcarrier as an initial solution of the transmit steering matrix for another designated subcarrier, which may reduce the number of iterations to derive the final solution. [0056] In yet anolher embodiment of explicit feedback, receiver station 150 oixiers the singular values (or eigenvalues) for each subcarrier from largest to smallest and also orders the right singular vectors for that subcarrier in the same manner so that each right singular vector is associated with the same singular value before and after the ordering. The ordered right singular vectors may be denoted as y,{fc), VjC'), ..., v'(fc) . The ordered singular values may be denoted as a1(k)&gt;a2(k)&gt;...&gt;(Tn(k). A wideband eigenmode is the set of same-order eigenmodes for all subcarriers after the ordering, e.g.. wideband eigenmode m includes eigenmode m of all subcarriers. Receiver station<br>

150 may perform rank prediction and evaluate data performance (e.g., overall throughput) for different numbers of wideband eigenmodes, e.g., the best wideband eigenmode, the two best wideband eigenmodes, and so on, and min {T, R} wideband eigenmodes. The number of wideband eigenmodes with the best performance is denoted as M and referred to as the predicted rank of the MIMO channel, where l<m r receiver station may then send the first m eigenvectors corresponding to best wideband eigenmodes for each designated subcamer. in another embodiment of explicit feedback sends a normalized right singular vector v subcarrier principal eigenmode which is eigeimiode with largest values. elements have unit magnitude but same phase as y vi allows fiill transmit power available antenna be used data transmission. yet channel response matrix h subcarrier.></m>
embodiment, receiver station 150 sends a channel covariance matrix R(k) for each designated subcarrier.<br>
[0058] In an embodiment that is applicable for explicit feedback, receiver station 150 sends full/complete values for each matrix reported to transmitter station 110. (A vector may be considered as a degenerated matrix containing one column.) In another embodiment, receiver station 150 sends full values for some reported matrices and differential/delta values for remaining reported matrices. For example, receiver station 150 may compute differential values for a chaimel response matrix H(A') as AH(j',) = H(t,)-H(yto) and may send back H{k') and AH(A,), where fc' for i = 0, 1,<br>
..., are designated subcarriers. In yet another embodiment, receiver station 150 maps a computed matrix to the nearest matrix in a codebook and sends the nearest matrix. For example, a codebook of possible matrices may be defined for V(A), and one matrix may be selected from the codebook for each designated subcarrier based on the matrix computed for that subcarrier. In yet another embodiment, receiver station 150 performs coding or compression of the matrices to be reported in order to reduce the amount of information to send.<br>
 <br>
[0059] In an embodiment of implicit feedback, receiver station 150 sends an unsteered pilot on each designated subcarrier. An unsteered pilot is a pilot sent without transmit steering. Receiver station ISO may send an unsteered pilot via R antennas by (1) applying different orthogonaJ codes to the pilot transmissions sent from tiie R antennas or (2) sending the pilot transmissions from the R antennas in different time intends. Transmitter station 110 may derive a channel response matrix for each designated subcarrier based on the unsteered pilot received on the subcarrier. Transmitter station 110 may decompose the channel response matrix for each designated subcarrier to obtain a transmit steering matrix for that subcarrier. [0060] In another embodiment of implicit feedback, receiver station 150 sends a steered pilot on each designated subcarrier. A steered pilot is a pUot sent with transmit steering- Receiver station 150 may perform singular value decomposition of H(A) as shown in equation (2) and obtain U(A). Alternatively, receiver station 150 may perform eigenvalue decomposition of H(A:) ■ H (k), instead of H {k) ■ H(k) as shown in equation (3), to obtain IJ('). Receiver station 150 may send a steered pilot on each eigenmode m, as follows:<br>
 <br>
where  p(k) is a pilot symbol sent on subcarrier k,<br>
u' (k) is an R x 1 left singular vector for eigenmodes m of subcarrier k, and x„{i) is an R x 1 vector of output symbols for R antennas on subcarrier k.<br>
In an embodiment, receiver station 150 may cycle through fbe S eigenmodes in different symbol periods. In another embodiment, receiver station 150 may send steered pilots on the S eigenmodes on different subcarriers, e.g., use subcarriers a, a+S, ... for eigenmode 1, use subcarriers a+\, a+S+1, ... for eigenmode 2, and so on, and use subcarriers H-S-l,fl+2S-l,.... for eigenmode S. [0061]       The received steered pilot at transmitter station 110 may be expressed as:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
where  M'{k) = V'(k)-'Z(k)-\f(k) is the singular value decomposition of the wireless channel from receiver station 150 to transmitter station 110, a1(k) is the singular value for eigenmode m of subcarrier k, and<br>
n„(A) is a vector of noise for subcarrier k at transmitter station 110.<br>
[0062] Equation (8) assumes channel reciprocity in a TDD system, so that H'(k) is the response of the MIMO channel from receiver station 150 to transmitter station 110. Equation (8) indicates that transmitter station 110 may estimate both Y(k) and I{ft) for each designated subcarrier based on a steered pilot sent by receiver station 150 without having to estimate the MIMO channel response or perform decompositioiL [0063] Transmitter station 110 obtains a transmit steering matrix for each designated subcarrier based on the channel information received from receiver station 150. Transmitter station 110 transmits data on the data subcarriers with the transmit steering matrices obtained for the designated subcarriers.<br>
[0064] In an embodiment, transmitter station 110 performs transmit steering for each data subcarrier with the transmit steering matrix for the closest designated subcarrier. As an example, for L = 3 in Table 1, the transmit steering matrix for designated subcarrier 2 may be used for each of data subcarriers 1, 2 and 3, the transmit steering matrix for designated subcarrier 5 may be used for each of data subcarriers 4, 5 and 6, and so on. For L = 5 in Table 1, the transmit steering matrix for designated subcarrier 3 may be used for each of data subcarriers 1 through 5, the transmit steering matrix for designated subcarrier 8 may be used for each of data subcarriers 6, 8, 9 and 10, and soon.<br>
[0065] In another embodiment, transmitter station 110 interpolates the transmit steering matrices for the designated subcarriers to obtain a transmit steering matrix for each data subcarrier. For example, transmitter station 110 may perform linear interpolation on two transmit steering matrices for two designated subcarriers to obtain<br>
 <br>
L -1 interpolated transmit steering matrices for L -1 subcarriers between these two designated subcarriers. Transmitter station 110 may perform interpolation in other manners and/or on more than two transmit steering matrices for more than two designated subcarriers.<br>
[0066] Transmitter station 110 may perfonn transmit steering for each data subcarrier as follows:<br>
 <br>
where H (k) = H(k) • V(k) is an effective channel response matrix for subcarrier k, and n„ (k) is a vector of noise for subcarrier k at receiver station 150.<br>
For simplicity, the noise may be assianed to be additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) with a zero mean vector and a covariance matrix of tt„(A) = o"' -I, where er' is the variance of the noise.<br>
[0068] Receiver station 150 may obtain H'(t) in various mannera. In one embodiment, transmitter station 110 sends an unsteered pilot on all or a subset of the data subcarriers. Receiver station 150 obtains a channel response matrix HCt) for each subcarrier in which the unsteered pilot is sent and decomposes the channel response matrix for each designated subcarrier to obtain a transmit steering matrix V(fc) for that subcarrier. Receiver station 150 then sends the transmit steering matrices (or a steered pilot) for the designated subcarriers to transmitter station 110. Receiver station 150 also uses these transmit steering matrices to derive the effective channel response matrices for the data subcarriers.<br>
 <br>
[0069] In another embodiment, receiver station 150 sends an unsteered pilot on the designated subcarriers. Transmitter station 110 obtains a channel response matrix H'{A) for each designated subcarrier and decomposes H (jfc) to obtain a transmit steering matrix V(fe). Transmitter station 110 may send an imsteered or steered pilot on the designated subcarriers, on all data subcarriers, or a subset of data subcarriers to allow receiver station 150 to obtain the effective channel response matrices. In general, either station or both stations may send pilot, either station or both stations may perform decomposition, and receiver station 150 may obtain the effective channel response matrices in various manners.<br>
[0070] Receiver station 150 may use various MIMO detection techniques to recover the data symbols sent by transmitter station 110. These MIMO detection techniques include minimum mean square error (MMSE), zero-forcing (ZF), maximal ratio combining (MRC), maximum likelihood (ML) decoding, list sphere decodii' (LSD), decision feedback equalization (DFE), and successive interference cancellation (SIC) techniques. Receiver station 150 may derive a spatial filter matrix for each data subcarrier k based on the MMSE technique, as follows:<br>
 <br>
n„ (k) is a vector of noise after the MIMO detection.<br>
The data symbol estimates in s(k) are estimates of the data symbols in s(k). [0072]       FIG. 5 shows a block diagram of an embodiment of TX spatial processor 130 and transmitters 132a through 132t at transmitter station 110.   Withm TX spatial processor 130, a demultiplexer (Demux) 510 receives the data symbols from TX data processor 120, maps the data symbols and pilot symbols to the proper subcarriers, and<br>
 <br>
provides vector s(k) for each data subcarrier in each symbol period. A unit 516 receives transmit steering matrices V(ft) for the designated subcarriers (e.g., from receiver station 150 or channel processor 144) and determines a transmit steering matrix V(A:) for each data subcarrier (e.g., by using the transmit steering matrix for the closest designated subcarrier or by interpolating the transmit steering matrices for the closest designated subcarriers on both sides of the data subcarrier). A unit 512 performs transmit steering on vector s(k) for each data subcarrier with the transmit steering<br>
matrix Y(') for that subcarrier and provides output symbol vector x(k), as shown in equation (9). A demultiplexer 514 demultiplexes the output symbols and provides T ou'ut symbol streams to T ttansmitters 132a through 132t.<br>
[0073] Each transmitter 132 includes an OFDM modulator (Mod) 520 and a TX radio frequency (RF) unit 522. OFDM modulator 520 receives an output symbol stream from demultiplexer 514 and generates OFDM symbols. TX RF unit 522 processes the OFDM symbols and generates a modulated signal for transmission via antenna 134. [0074] FIG. 6 shows a block diagram of an embodiment of receivers 154a through 154r and RX spatial processor 160 at receiver station 150. Each antenna 152 receives the modulated signals from transmitter station 110 and provides a received signal to a respective receiver 154. Each receiver 154 includes an RX RF unit 610 and an OFDM demodulator (Demod) 612. RX RF tmit 610 processes the received signal and provides samples. OFDM demodtilator 612 performs OFDM demodulation on the samples, provides received data symbols to a MIMO detector 620 within RX spatial processor 160, and provides received pilot symbols to channel processor 194. Channel processor 194 estimates the MIMO channel response for each subcarrier with pilot transmission based on the received pilot symbols for that subcarrier. Channel processor 194 provides channel response matrices to a spatial filter matrix computation unit 624 and a decomposition unit 626 within RX spatial processor 160.<br>
[00751 Unit 626 performs eigenvalue decomposition or singular value decomposition of the chaimel response matrix H(A) for each designated subcarrier and provides a transmit steering matrix V(A:) for that subcarrier. The transr&amp;it steering matrices for the designated subcarriers may be sent back to transmitter station 110 or<br>
 <br>
used to generate a steered pilot for transmitter station 110.  Unit 626 also provides the transmit steering matrix y(it) for each data subcarrier to unit 624. [0076]      Unit 624 derives a spatial filter matrix M(fc) for each data subcarrier based on the chaimel response matrix H(ft) and the transmit steering matrix V(fc) for that<br>
subcarrier, e.g., as shown in equation (11). Unit 624 may derive a spatial filter matrix for each data subcarrier whereas unit 626 may derive a transmit steering matrix for each designated subcarrier. Hence, a given transmit steering matrix V()t) may be used to derive spatial filter matrices for multiple data subcarriers. MIMO detector 620 performs MIMO detection on the received data symbols for each data subcarrier with the spatial filter matrix for that subcarrier, e.g., as shown in equation (12), and provides data symbol estimates. A demultiplexer 622 demultiplexes the data symbol estimates for all data subcarriers and provides the data symbol estimates to RX data processor 170. [0077] The transmission techniques described herein may provide good data performance with substantial reduction in computation and feedback overhead. Computer simulations were performed for various MIMO dimensionalities (RxT), channel models, number of data streams, and receiver signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). For the case with L = 3 in Table 1, transmit steering matrices were derived for 20 out of 52 data subcarriers, and the transmit steering matrix for designated subcarrier/ was used for data subcarriers j -1, y and j + \. Computation for transmit steering matrices was reduced by approximately 60% at a loss of about 3% of the c'&gt;acity for channel model E compared to the case in which a transmit steering matrix was computed for each data subcarrier. Channel model E has the least fi'quency coherence, and performance is generally better for other channel models. Larger values of L provide greater reduction in computation albeit with more loss of capacity.<br>

The transmit steering matrix for each of the multiple subcarriers may be (1) set equal to the transmit steering matrix obtained for the closest one of the at least one subcarrier or (2) derived by interpolating two or more transmit steering matrices obtained for two or more closest subcarriers. In an embodiment of block 730, the transmitter station performs transmit steering for each of the multiple subcarriers with the transmit steering matrix determined for that subcarrier.

[0081] FIG. 9 shows an embodiment of a process 900 for receiving data. A receiver station sends channel information for at least one subcarrier that is a subset of multiple subcarriers used to send data (block 910). The receiver station receives a data transmission sent on the multiple subcarriers from multiple transmit antennas to multiple receive antennas using transmit steering matrices derived for the multiple subcarriers based on the channel information for the at least one subcarrier (block 920).<br>
 <br>
[0082] In an embodiment of block 910, the receiver station obtains at least one channel response matrix for the at least one subcamer and decomposes the at least one channel response matrix to obtain at least one transmit steering matrix, e.g., V(A:) and/or U(k). The receiver may send at least one transmit steering matrix y(k) as the channel information. The receiver station may also map the at least one transmit steering matrix y(k) to at least one codeword in a codebook and send the at least one codeword as the channel information. The receiver station may also send at least one channel response matrix or at least one channel covariance matrix as the channel inform^on. The receiver station may also send a steered pilot on the at least one subcarrier using at least one transmit steering matrix U(A). The receiver station may determine frequency selectivity or delay spread of the wireless channel and determine the number of subcarriers to send channel information based on the frequency selectivity or delay spread of the wireless channel.<br>
[0083] In an embodiment of block 920, the receiver station obtains multiple channel response matrices for the multiple subcarriers (block 922) and decomposes at least one channel response matrix for the at least one subcarrier to obtain at least one transmit steering matrix V(A:) (block 924).

The receiver station derives multiple spatial filter matrices for the multiple subcarriers based on the multiple channel response matrices and the transmit steering matrices for these subcarriers, e.g., in accordance with MMSE detection techniques (block 928).
