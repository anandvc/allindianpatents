Within the scope of the invention, i.a., the compound (6R)-3-methoxy-5,6,9,10,11,12-hexahydro-4a[HI]benzofuro [3a, 3 ,2-ef][2]benzazepin-6-ol (norgalanthamine), specifically racemic nbrgalanthamine, (-) norgalanthamine and (+) norgalanthamine, is especially to be considered.  Both racemic norgalanthamine and its (+)- and (-)-isomers can be used in pharmaceutical agents for treatment of the diseases mentioned above under a) to m) as active ingredients per se or in combination with other active ingredients.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can be synthesized with proper use of the process and modes of operation for the production of galanthamine and galanthamine derivatives described in WO 96/12692 and WO 97/40049.<br>
An addition to the above-mentioned synthesis methods, some of the compounds according to the invention can be produced with u;se of the combinatory (or parallel) synthesis technology.  With tiiis synthesis method, the skeleton of interest (or nuclear<br><br>
51<br>
molecule) is immobilized in a solid phase (e.g., glass pellets, polymer pellets or another inert vehicle) , which facilitates the' separation of excess reactants from a modified skeleton.  The solid phase that is used in each case depends on the concentration capacity, the reactants that are used and the reaction solvents.  In particular, polymer pellets, such as, for example, Merrie,field resin, Wang resin or TentaGel (Rapp) resin, are considered.<br>
The immobilization of the skeleton is carried out by a functional group that can be recovered in the last step of the synthesis under suitable reaction conditions.  The last step consists in the cleavage of the desired product from the solid phase.  The selection of the linker unit, which couples the basic molecule to the solid phase, depends on the combination and/or the series of reactants and the reaction conditions that are necessary to obtain maximum yields and/or purity.  Moreover, with different linkers, the products can be cleaved off from the same solid phase under different conditions.  This technology allows a quick¦synthesis including automated syntheses of compounds according to the invention.<br>

Step l:  4-Bromo-2-methoxy-5-(2-nitroethenyl)-phenol<br><br>
40.0 g {173 mmol) of 2-bromo-5-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde and 13.3 g (173 mmol) of ammonium acetate are refluxed in 400 nil of nitromethane for 15 minutes.  The reaction mixture is evaporated to the dry state, the residue is digested in about 70 ml of methanol and then suctioned off.  To obtain a second fraction of the product, the methanol solution is concentrated by evaporation to about 30 ml and then poured onto 500 ml of water. The precipitated solid is filtered off by suction, washed with about 100 ml of water and dried together with the first fraction at 50°C/50 mbar, by which a total of 43.6 g (92% of theory) of yellow crystals is obtained on 4-bromo-2-methoxy-5-(2-nitroethenyl)-phenol with a melting point of 152-154°C.<br><br>

Step 2:  4-Bromo-2-methoxy-5-(2-aminoethyl)-phenol<br><br>
Method A:<br>
7.2 g (74 mmol) of concentrated sulfuric acid is added in drops at 0°C under nitrogen atmosphere to 16 8 ml (14 8 mmol) of a 0.88N lithium aluminum hydride solution in diethyl ether.  10.0 g (36.5 mmol) of 4-bromo-2-methoxy-5-{2-nitroethenyl)-phenol is partially dissolved in one liter of absolute diethyl ether in boiling heat, and then the supernatant solution is added with a transfer needle and dry nitrogen to the aluminum hydride solution<br><br>
65<br>
at room temperature.  After the addition is completed, 700 ml oE diethyl ether from the reaction mixture is distilled in undissolved 4-bromo-2-methoxy-5-(2-nitroethenyl)-phenol in the receiving flask.  By heating to reflux, a saturated solution is produced that is fed to the reaction mixture as above.  This<br>
process is repeated (three to four times) until the addition of<br>
*<br>
4-bromo-2-methoxy-5-(2-nitroethenyl)-phenol is completed.  Then,<br>
it is hydrolyzed with water at 0°C, and the ethereal phase is extracted twice with 300 ml each of 4N hydrochloric acid.  The acid solution is mixed with 22.2 g (148 mmol) of L-( + )-tartaric acid, made basic with concentrated aqueous ammonia and exhaustively extracted with chloroform.  The combined organic phases are washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried (Na2SO4), filtered and concentrated by evaporation, by which 2.2 0 g (24% of theory) of colorless crystals is obtained on 4-bromo-2-methoxy-5-(2-aminoethyl)-phenyl with a melting point of 170-172°C.<br>
Method B:<br>
A solution of 18.0 g (65.7 mmol) of 4-bromo-2-methoxy-5~ (2-nitroethenyl)-phenol in 200 ml of absolute tetrahydrofuran is added in drops over the course of 2 hours under nitrogen to a reflux-heated solution of 15.0 g (394.2 mmol) of lithium aluminum hydride in 1 1 of absolute tetrahydrofuran.  Then, while being cooled with ice, the reaction mixture is hydrolyzed with about 2 0 ml of water and evaporated to the dry state.  The residue is taken up in 500 ml of 2K hydrochloric acid and washed with 500 ml<br><br>
66<br>
of ethyl acetate.  The washing phase is shaken back with 200 ml of 2N hydrochloric acid, the combined aqueous phases are mixed with 70 g (467 mmol) of L-(+)-tartaric acid, made basic with concentrated aqueous ammonia and extracted three times with 800 ml of chloroform each.  The combined organic phases are dried on sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated by evaporation, by which 9.92 g (61% of theory) of colorless crystals is obtained on 4^bromo-2-methoxy-5-(2-aminoethyl)-phenol with a melting point of lftO-172°C.<br>
S|tep 3:  4-Bromo-5-{N- [ (4-hydroxyphenyl)methyl] -2~aminoethyl} -2-m'e t hoxypheno 1<br><br>
6.4 g (26.0 mmol) of 4-bromo-2-methoxy-5-(2-aminoethyl) -phenol and 3.2 g (26.0 mmol) of p-hydroxy-benzaldehyde are refluxed for 2 hours in 150 ml of absolute ethanol.  Then, while being cooled with ice, 5.0 g (132.0 mmol) of sodium borohydride Is added and refluxed for another half hour, the excess sodium borohydride is destroyed by adding approximately 1 ml of glacial acetic acid as well as 50 ml of water while being cooled with jice, and the solution is concentrated by evaporation.  The residue is acidified with 2N hydrochloric acid and washed with 50,<br><br>

Method l:<br>
A solution of 7.72 g {20.0 mmol) of (+)-0,O-di-p-toluoyl tartaric acid in 15 ml of methanol is added in drops to a solution of 10.92 g (40.0 mmol) of rac.norgalanthamine (4) in 40 ml of methanol, and it is then rewashed with 1 ml of methanol. The solution is mixed with a seed crystal (without a seed crystal, crystal formation can take several weeks), and it is allowed to stand for two days at 4°C.  Then, it is thoroughly ground with a glass rod and allowed to stand for another two to five days at 4°C, whereby it is always thoroughly ground again with a glass rod.  Then, the precipitated salt is suctioned off, rewashed three times with ice-cold methanol and taken up in 100 mi of water.  The aqueous phase is made basic with concentrated aqueous ammonia and extracted three times with 60 ml each of ethyl acetate.  The combined organic phases are washed once with saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried (Na2SO4, activated carbon), filtered and concentrated by evaporation, by which 2.9 g (37.5% of theory) of colorless crystals is obtained on {-)-norgalanthamine (8).<br>

The educt was suspended in ethanol, and the tyramine was added while being stirred, then the reaction mixture was refluxed for 8.5 hours.  Since the Schiff base (MH-16' or 34') that formed on the TLC plate breaks back down into the starting materials, the reaction progress was determined by reduction of a small 'sample with sodium borohydride, conventional working-up and application of the product obtained.<br>
After 8.5 hours, the reaction mixture was cooled in an ice bath to 0°C, and the sodium borohydride, dissolved in 4 ml of water/I g, was slowly added in drops, then stirred in an ice bath for 30 minutes.  Then, it was poured onto 150 ml of ice/water/1 g of aldehyde while being stirred vigorously, the white precipitate that was produced was filtered off and dried in a vacuum drying<br><br>

The filtrate was mixed with water, the acetone was distilled off in a vacuum, and the remaining aqueous phase was extracted with methylene chloride.  The collected organic phases were washed with saturated common salt solution, dried on sodium sulfate, filtered, and the solvent was drawn off. The oily residue was taken up in acetone, whereby a precipitate settled out, which could be obtained as a second fraction.

While being cooled with ice, potassium-tert-butylate (20.S g, 183 mmol) is added to a suspension of (methoxymethyl) -triphenylphosphonium chloride (50.0 g, 152 mmol) in absolute THF (330 ml).  After 15 minutes, 2-bromo-4-methoxy-5-(1-methylethoxy)benzaldehyde (33.1 g, 121 mmol) is added in portions.<br>
After 15 minutes, the residue that is obtained after the solvent is removed in a rotary evaporator is dispersed between water (300 ml) and ether (300 ml).  The organic phase is dried (sodium sulfate), filtered, and the residue that is obtained after concentration by evaporation {37.3 g) is purified by means of MPLC (petroleum ether : ethyl acetate = 2:1, flow 70 ml/min). In this way, the product is obtained in the form of colorless crystals (32.5 g, 85%).<br>

2.  By Solid-Phase Synthesis<br>
0.300 g (0.102 mmolj of norgalanthamine-6-yloxy)-1,5-dioxopentyloxymethyl-Merrifield resin is steeped in a 5-ml-polyethylene frit that is sealed on both sides for 3 0 minutes in 3 ml of dimethylformamide/acetone (l/l) and after filtering, it is suspended in a solution of 0.125 g (0.315 mmol) of 8-(6-iodo-1-oxohexyl)-1,2,5,6-tetrahydro-4H-pyrrolo[3,2,1-ij]quinolin-4-one and 54 p.1 (0.041 g, 0.315 mmol) of ethyldiisopropylamine in 3 ml of dimethylformamide/acetone (1/1).<br>
The suspension is shaken at room temperature for 19 hours. A negative chloranil test indicates the complete conversion of the secondary amine.  The resin is washed three times with dimethylformamide (2 minutes, 3 ml) and six times with tetrahydrofuran/methanol (4/1, 2 minutes, 3 ml).  The resin is suspended below in a solution that consists of 0.113 g (0.63 mmol) of 30% sodium methanolate-methanol solution and 3.0 ml of tetrahydrofuran/methanol (4/1).  After 15 hours, the solution is filtered off, and the resin is extracted six times with 3 ml each of dichloromethane.<br>
The combined filtrates are neutralized with methanolic hydrochloric acid, diluted with 10 ml of dichloromethane, washed twice with 15 ml of saturated sodium chloride solution, dried on sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated by evaporation in a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure.  The crude product is i  separated by means of MPLC (200 g of silica gel, v = 285 nm, chloroform/methanol/concentrated ammonia = 96/3/1) .

2.11 ml (1.538 g, 19.3 tnraol) of triethylamine and 0.81 ml (0.693 g, 6.384 mmol) of trimethylsilyl chloride are sprayed under inert-gas atmosphere by means of a syringe through a septum into a suspension of 0.788 g (0.552 g, 2.13 mmol) of norsanguinine (HPLC purity 70%) and 10 ml of absolute dichloromethane, and the suspension is stirred for three hours at room temperature.  In the meantime, a flocculent precipitate settles out.  Then, 0.34 ml (0.385 g, 3.192 mmol) of allyl chloroformate is added while being cooled in an ice bath (exothermic).  The reaction mixture is heated within two hours to room temperature while being stirred, by the ice bath being allowed to thaw.  The reaction is halted by adding 13 ml of 2N hydrochloric acid, and the phases are separated.  The organic phase is washed four times with 10 ml each of 2N hydrochloric acid and once with common salt solution, the combined aqueous phases are re-extracted once with 20 ml of dichloromethane.  The combined organic phases are dried on sodium sulfate and filtered. After the solvent is distilled off in a rotary evaporator, the crude product (HPLC purity 87.5%) is purified by means of MPLC<br>
(50 g of silica gel, v = 285 nin, chloroform/methanol = 95/5) . After concentration by evaporation and drying in a high vacuum, the product is obtained as a yellowish, highly viscous oil, which crystallizes during concentration by evaporation from dichloromethane.
