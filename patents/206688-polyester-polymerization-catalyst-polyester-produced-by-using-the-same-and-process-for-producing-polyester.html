SPECIFICATION POLYESTER POLYMERIZATION CATALYST , POLYESTER PRODUCED BY USING THE SAME, AND PROCESS FOR PRODUCING POLYESTER<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a polyester polymerization catalyst, polyester produced by using the same and a process for producing polyester, and in particular to a novel polymerization catalyst not using a germanium or antimony compound as a maj or catalytic component, polyester produced by using the same and a process for producing polyester.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
Polyesters represented by polyethylene terephthalate (PET) ,polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) , polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) etc. are excellent in mechanical and chemical characteristics, and are used in various fields for example in fibers for clothing and industrial materials, films for such as packaging or magnetic tapes, sheets, hollow molded articles such as bottles, casings for electrical or electronic parts , and other molded articles of engineering plastics, depending on the characteristics of each polyester.<br><br>
As typical polyester, polyester comprising an aromatic dicarboxylic acid and an alkylene glycol as maj or constituent components , for example polyethylene terephthalate (PET), is industrially produced by esterification or transesterification of terephthalic acid or dimethyl terephthalate and ethylene glycol to produce bis (2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate which is then subjected to polycondensation at high temperatures in vacuo in the presence of a catalyst.<br>
As a conventional polyester polymerization catalyst used in polycondensation of polyester, antimony trioxide has been used widely.  Antimony trioxide is an inexpensive and highly active catalyst, but when antimony trioxide is used as a maj or component, that is, when it is used in such an amount as to exhibit a practical rate of polymerization, an antimony metal is precipitated thus causing problems such as gray disdiscoloration or generation of insoluble particles in polyester.  For this reason, polyester absolutely free of antimony or not containing antimony as a major catalytic component is desired.<br>
The above-described insoluble particles in polyester causes the following problems: (1) In polyester for film, the antimony metal precipitated serves as insoluble particles in<br><br>
polyester, which causes not only deposits around die during melt extrusion but also deficiency in the surface of film. Further, when the polyester with insoluble particles is used as a starting material of hollow molded articles, it is difficult to obtain hollow molded articles excellent in transparency.<br>
(2) The insoluble particles in polyester for fibers serves as insoluble particles not only causing a reduction in the strength of fibers, but also deposits around spinnerets during spinning. In production of polyester fibers, a polyester polymerization catalyst not causing formation of insoluble particles is desired from the viewpoint of productivity.<br>
As a method of solving the problem described above , an attempt had been made at preventing gray discoloration and formation of insoluble particles in PET while using antimony trioxide as a catalyst*  In Japanese Patent No. 2666502, for example, formation of black insoluble particles in PET is prevented by using antimony trioxide, a bismuth compound and a selenium compound as a polycondensation catalyst. Further, JP-A 9-291141 describes that precipitation of an antimony metal is prevented when antimony trioxide containing sodium and iron oxides is used as a polymerization catalyst.  However, these<br><br>
polycondensation catalysts cannot achieve the object of reducing the content of antimony in polyester.<br>
As a method of solving the problem of the antimony catalyst in uses requiring transparency of PET bottles etc. r for example JP-A 6-279579 discloses a method of improving transparency by prescribing the proportion of antimony and phosphorus compounds used. However, it cannot be said that hollow molded articles made of polyester obtained by this method are sufficiently transparent.<br>
Further, JP-A 10-36495 discloses a process for producing polyester excellent in transparency, which comprises use of antimony trioxide, phosphoric acid and a sulfonic acid compound. However, polyester obtained by such a method has lower thermal stability, and there is the problem of a high content of acetaldehyde in the resultant hollow molded article.<br>
Polycondensation catalysts substituted for antimony containing catalysts such as antimony trioxide have also been examined, and titanium compounds such as tetraalkoxy titanate or tin compounds have previously been proposed, but have a problem that polyester produced by using these compounds is easily thermally degraded during melt molding, and the polyester is significantly discolored.<br><br>
In an attempt at solving the problem arising when such titanium compounds are used as the polycondensation catalyst, for example JP-A 55-116722 proposes a method of simultaneously using tetraalkoxy titanate in combination with a cobalt salt and a calcium salt-  Further, JP-A 8-73581 proposes a method of using tetraalkoxy titanate in combination with a cobalt compound as the polycondensation catalyst and simultaneously using a optical brightener.  By these techniques, PET discoloration occurring when tetraalkoxy titanate is used as the polycondensation catalyst can be reduced, but prevention of thermal degradation of PET cannot be efficiently achieved.<br>
In another attempt at preventing thermal degradation during melt molding of polyester polymerized in the presence of a titanium compound as the catalyst, for example JP-A 10-259296 describes a method of adding a phosphorus compound after polymerization of polyester in the presence of the titanium compound as the catalyst.  However , effective mixing of the additive with the polymer after polymerization is technically difficult and leads to higher costs, so this prior art method is not practically used under the present circumstances.  It is known that aluminum compounds are generally inferior<br><br>
in catalytic activity.  Among the aluminum compounds, aluminum chelate compounds are reported to have a higher catalytic activity as the polycondensation catalyst than other aluminum compounds , but the aluminum chelate compounds cannot be said to have a sufficient catalytic activity as compared with the antimony compound or titanium compound described above, and polyester polymerized for a long time using the aluminum compound as the catalyst has the problem of lower thermal stability.<br>
A method of adding an alkali metal compound to an aluminum compound to form a polyester polymerization catalyst having a sufficient catalytic activity is also known.  When such a known catalyst is used, polyester excellent in thermal stability can be obtained, but this catalyst using an alkali metal compound in combination should be added in a larger amount in order to attain a practical catalytic activity, and as a result, there arises at least one of the following problems attributable to the alkali metal compound in the resultant polyester polymer.<br>
1) The amount of insoluble particles is increased so that when the polyester is used in fibers, the spinnability and the physical properties of fibers are getting worse, and when used in films, the physical<br><br>
properties of films are getting worse.<br>
2)	The hydrolytic stability of the resultant polyester polymer is lowered, and due to formation of insoluble particles, the transparency thereof is lowered.<br>
3)	There arises the phenomenon of deficiency in color tone of the resultant polyester polymer r that is , yellow discoloration of the polymer, and when the polyester is used in films or hollow bottles, there arises the problem of degradation in the color tone of the molded articles.<br>
4)	During production of molded articles by melt molding, filter pressure is increased due to clogging of a filter with insoluble particles, to lower productivity.<br>
As an non-antimony catalyst for giving polyester free of the problem described above, a germanium compound has been practically used, but this catalyst has a problem that it is very expensive and easily distilled away from a reaction system during polymerization, thus changing the concentration of the catalyst in the reaction system and making control of polymerization difficult, so use of the germanium component as a major catalytic component is problematic.<br>
For preventing thermal degradation of polyester during melt molding, there is also a method of removincr<br><br>
a catalyst from polyester. JP-A 10-251394 discloses a method of removing a catalyst from polyester wherein a polyester resin is brought into contact with an extractant as supercritical fluid in the presence of an acidic substance.  However , the method of using such supercritical fluid is technically difficult and leads to higher costs for products, and is thus not preferable.<br>
For the reasons described above, there is demand for a polymerization catalyst which comprises as a maj or catalytic component a metal component other than antimony and germanium, is excellent in catalytic activity and gives polyester free of the problems described above.<br>
This invention provides a novel polyester polymerization catalyst comprising, as a major catalytic metal component, a metal component other than antimony or germanium, polyester produced by using the same and a process for producing polyester by using the catalyst.<br>
Further, this invention provides a novel polyester polymerization catalyst comprising not an antimony compound or a germanium compound as a major catalytic component but aluminum as a major metal component, polyester produced by using the same and<br><br>
aprocess for producing polyester by using the catalyst.<br>
Another obj ect of this invention is to provide a polyester polymerization catalyst which comprises not an antimony compound or a germanium compound as a major catalytic component but aluminum as a major metal component, is excellent in catalytic activity, and without deactivating or removing the catalyst, gives polyester not only excellent in thermal stability by effectively inhibiting thermal degradation during melt molding but also superior in color tone and transparency without formation of insoluble particles.<br>
Further, this invention provides polyester which improves thermal stability, the problem of formation of insoluble particles and productivity by using the catalyst during melt molding thereof into films , hollow molded articles such as bottles , fibers and engineering plastics, and gives products superior in quality level by using virgin resin thereof or by reutilizing scraps thereof generated during molding, as well as a process for producing polyester by using the polyester polymerization catalyst.<br>
Another obj ect of this invention is to provide a polyester polymerization catalyst giving polyester excellent in thermal oxidation stability and hydrolytic stability, polyester excellent in thermal<br><br>
oxidation stability and hydrolytic stability, and a process for producing polyester by using the polyester polymerization catalyst.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide molded articles such as fibers, films and bottles comprising polyester produced by using the catalyst. As a result of extensive study for solving the problems described above, the present inventors found that an aluminum compound is originally inferior in catalytic activity, but the aluminum compound when used in the coexistence of a phosphorus compound having a specific structure can have a sufficient activity as the polymerization catalyst, thus arriving at the present invention .  When the poly condensation catalyst of this invention is used, polyester excellent in qualities which does not use an antimony compound or a germanium compound can be obtained.<br>
That is, this invention provides a polyester polymerization catalyst comprising an aluminum compound and a phosphorus compound having a specific structure, polyester produced by using the same and a process for producing polyester, in order to solve the problems described above.<br>

Among these, the carboxylates, inorganic acid salts and chelate<br><br>
compounds are preferable , among which aluminum acetate , basic aluminum acetate, aluminum chloride, aluminum hydroxide, aluminum hydroxide chloride and aluminum acetyl acetonate are particularly preferable.<br>
The amount of aluminum or the aluminum compound used in this invention is preferably 0 . 001 to 0.05 mol-% , more preferably 0.005 to 0.02 mol-% relative to the number of moles of the whole constituent units of carboxylic acid components such as dicarboxylic acids and polyvalent carboxylic acids in the resultant polyester.  When the amount thereof is less than 0-001 mol-% , the activity of the resultant catalyst may not be sufficient, while the amount thereof is greater than 0 . 05 mol-% , there may arise problems such as a reduction in thermal stability and thermal oxidation stability, formation of insoluble particles attributable to aluminum, and an increase in discoloration.

reaction system is gradually reduced to 0.1 Torr. 3 ) (In the step of poly condensation)  Polycondensation<br>
reaction is conducted at 275 °C at 0.1 Torr, and the mixture is polymerized until the intrinsic viscosity (IV) of the polyethylene terephthaiate reaches 0.65 dl/g.<br>
4) The polymerization time required in the step of polycondensation is determined as AP (min).<br>
These procedures are conducted in a reaction unit in a batch system.<br>
1) Production of a BHET mixture (in the step of producing BHET) is conducted in a known method. For example, terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol in the molar ratio of 1 : 2 are introduced into an autoclave in a batch system equipped with a stirrer, followed<br>
by esterif ication reaction at 245 °C at a pressure of 0.25 MPa during while water is distilled away from the<br><br>
system.<br>
By allowing the activity parameter AP to be within the range described above, the reaction rate is high thus reducing the time for producing polyester through poly condensation. AP is preferably 1.5 T or less, more preferably 1*3 T or less, and most preferably 1.0 T or less.<br>
2) (In the step of adding a catalyst), *a predetermined amount of a catalyst" means the amount of a catalyst which is varied depending on the activity of the catalyst, and the amount of a catalyst is low when the catalyst has a high activity, whereas the amount of a catalyst is high when the catalyst has a low activity.  The amount of the catalyst used is up to 0 .1 mol-% in terms of its aluminum compound relative to the number of moles of terephthalic acid.  The catalyst added in an amount greater than 0.1 mol-% is not practical because the amount in residual polyester is increased.<br>
When the polyester polymerization catalyst of this invention is used to produce PET, the thermal oxidation stability (TOS) of the PET preferably satisfies the following relationship (3).<br>
TOS 
TOS in this relationship is determined as follows :<br><br>

meshes or less which are then vacuum-dried at 130 °C for 12 hours, and 0,3 g of the powders are placed in<br>
a glass test tube and vacuum-dried at 70 °C for 12 hours and then heated at 230 °C for 15 minutes in dry air over silica gel, to determine their final IV from which TOS is calculated using the following equation: TOS = 0.245 { [IV]fi~147 - [IVli"147}<br>
wherein [IV]i and [IV]fl refer to IV (dl/g) before and after the heating test respectively.<br>
The method of heating in dry air over silica gel can be, for example, a method wherein a glass test tube is heated in air dried by connecting a dry tube containing silica gel to an upper part of the test tube .<br>
By using the polyester polymerization catalyst constituted as described above, polyester giving molded articles such as films and PET bottles excellent in thermal aging resistance can be obtained.<br>

When the polyester polymerization catalyst of this invention is used for polymerizing PET, the hydrolytic stability (HS) parameter of the PET preferably satisfies the following relationship (4) .<br><br><br>
HS is determined as follows: Melt-polymerized chips of PET (having an initial IV ([IVK) of about 0.65 dl/g are frozen and milled to give powders of 20<br>
meshes or less which are then vacuum-dried at 130 °C for 12 hours, and 1 g of the powders, together with 100 ml pure water, are placed in a beaker and then heated under stirring for 6 hours in a closed system at 130<br>
°C under pressure, to determine their intrinsic viscosity ([IV]f2) from which HS is calculated using the following equation:<br><br>
The beaker used in measurement of HS is the one from which no acid or alkali is eluted. Specifically, use of a stainless steel beaker, a quartz beaker etc. is preferable.<br>
By using the catalyst having such constitution, a polyester polymer giving molded articles excellent in hydrolytic stability can be obtained.<br>
HS is more preferably 0.09 or less, particularly preferably 0.085 or less.<br>
When the polyester polymerization catalyst of this invention is used for polymerization of PET, the<br>
color delta b value parameter (Ab) of the PET preferably satisfies the following relationship (5):<br><br>
Ab 
Ab in this relationship is a value obtained by subtracting the Hunter's b value determined by a color difference meter after polymerization of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) resin chips having an intrinsic viscosity of about 0.65 dl/g melt-polymerized in the presence of antimony trioxide as the catalyst, from the b value in the presence of a predetermined catalyst. This antimony trioxide is added in an amount of 0.05 mol-% in terms of antimony atom relative to an acid component in polyethylene terephthalate formed. Antimony trioxide used for comparison is antimony trioxide having 99 % or more purity.  For example , Antimony (III) oxide having 99.999 % purity produced by ALDRICH is used.<br>
According to such constitution, the catalyst can give polyester excellent color tone when formed into<br>
melt-molded articles .  The Ab value is more preferably 3.0 or less, particularly preferably 2.5 or less.<br>
The PET resin chips used in measurement of TS, TOS and HS in this invention are those prepared by rapid cooling thereof in a molten state after the steps 1) to 3) above. The resin chips used in this measurement are, for example, those in the form of a cylinder of about 3 mm in length and about 2 mm in diameter.  The<br><br><br>
in a molten state after the steps 1) to 3&gt; above.  The method of obtaining substantially amorphous resin chips includes e.g. a method wherein the polymer after melt polymerization is removed from the reaction system by discharging it through an outlet in the reaction system, immediately quenched with cold water, maintained in cold water for a sufficient time and cut into chips.  The resin chips thus obtained are free of whitening resulting from crystallization and transparent in the outward appearance .  The resin chips thus obtained are air-dried for about one day at room temperature on e.g. a filter paper and then measured for color.  After the operation described above, the resin chips remain transparent in the outward appearance without undergoing whitening attributable to crystallization.  In the resin chips for color measurement, additives (e.g. titanium dioxide) influencing the outward appearance shall not be used. The resin chips used in color measurement are, for example, those in the form of a cylinder of about 3 mm in length and about 2 mm in diameter.<br>
Out of the relationships (1) to (5) above, at least two relationships are satisfied by the polyester<br><br>
polymerization catalyst of this invention in a preferable embodiment.<br>
The polyester polymerization catalyst of this invention is preferably free of alkali metals , alkaline earth metals or compounds thereof.<br>
However, in a preferable embodiment of this invention, at least one member selected from alkali metals, alkaline earth metals and compounds thereof is allowed to be coexistent in a small amount as a second metal containing component in addition to aluminum or a compound thereof -  The secondary metal-containing component is allowed to be coexistent in the catalyst system in order to improve not only the effect of inhibiting formation of diethylene glycol but also the catalytic activity, thus providing a catalytic component increasing the reaction rate to improve productivity effectively.<br>
The technique of adding an alkali metal compound or an alkaline earth metal compound to an aluminum compound to form a catalyst having a sufficient catalytic activity is known- When such known catalyst is used, polyester excellent in thermal stability can be obtained, but the known catalyst using an alkali metal compound or an alkaline earth metal compound in combination with an aluminum compound should be added<br><br><br>
causes an increase in the amount of insoluble particles attributable to the alkali metal, and use of the alkali metal compound in producing fibers causes a decrease in productivity and physical properties of the fibers , while use thereof for producing films causes a deterioration in film physical properties, transparency, thermal stability, thermal oxidation stability and hydJ:o lytic stability.  Further, the coloration of melt-molded articles such as fibers and films is deteriorated.  When the alkaline earth metal compound is used in combination, a practical activity cannot be achieved without deteriorating the thermal stability and thermal oxidation stability of the resultant polyester, while discoloration occurs upon heating, and the almount of insoluble particles is increased.<br>
In this invention, when an alkali metal, an alkaline earth metal and compounds thereof are added as the polymerization catalyst, the amount M (mol-%)<br>
thereof is pref erably in the range of lxlO"6 to 0 .1 mol-% , more preferably 5x1 C~6 to 0 . 05 mol-% , further pref erably 1x10"5 to 0.03 mol-% r and most preferably lxl0"5 to 0.01 mol- - relative to the number of moles of the whole<br><br>
polycarboxylic acid units constituting polyester. The amount of the alkali metal and alkaline earth metal added is so small that the rate of reaction can be increased without causing problems such as a reduction in thermal stability, formation of insoluble particles, and discoloration*  Further, the rate of reaction can be increased without causing problems such as a reduction in hydrolytic stability.  When the amount M of an alkali metal, an alkaline earth metal and compounds thereof is greater than 0.1 mol-% or more, a reduction in thermal stability, formation of insoluble particles, an increase in discoloration and a reduction in hydrolytic stability may be problematic<br>
in manufacturing of products.  WhenM is less than lxlO"6 mol-%, the effect of the metal added is not evident.<br>
An alkali metal or alkaline earth metal constituting the secondary metal-containing component which is used preferably in addition to aluminum or a compound thereof in this invention is preferably at least one member selected from Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs , Be, Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba, and an alkali metal or a compound thereof is preferably used.  When the alkali metal or a compound thereof is used, use of Li, Na or K is particularly preferable.  Compounds of the alkali metal or alkaline earth metal include salts of these<br><br>
metals, for example saturated aliphatic carboxylates such as formate, acetate, propionate, butyrate and oxalate, unsaturated aliphatic carboxylates such as acrylate and methacrylate, aromatic carboxylates such as benzoate, halogen-containing carboxylates such as trichloroacetate, hydroxy carboxylates such as lactate, citrate and salicylate, inorganic acid salts such as carbonate, sulfate, nitrate, phosphate, phosphonate, hydrogen carbonate, hydrogen phosphate, hydrogen sulfide, sulfite, thiosulfate, hydrochloride, hydrobromate , chlorate andbromate , organic sulfonates such as 1-propane sulfonate, 1-pentane sulfonate and naphthalene sulfonate, organic sulfates such as lauryl sulfate, alkoxides such as methoxy, ethoxy, n-propoxy, iso-propoxy, n-butoxy and tert-butoxy, chelate compounds such as acetyl acetonate, hydrides, oxides and hydroxides.<br>
When highly alkaline ones such as hydroxides are used out of these alkali metals, alkaline earth metals or compounds thereof, they tend to be hardly dissolved in organic solvents, for example diols such as ethylene glycol or alcohols , so they shouldbe added as an aqueous solution to the polymerization system, which may be problematic in the polymerization process. Further, when highly alkaline ones such as hydroxides are used,<br><br>
polyester during polymerization easily undergoes side reactions such as hydrolysis, while the polymerized polyester is easily discolored and hydrolytic stability tends to be lowered.  Accordingly, preferable examples of the alkali metals or compounds thereof or alkaline earth metals or compounds thereof in this invention are alkali metal salts or alkaline earth metal salts selected from saturated aliphatic carboxylate, unsaturated aliphatic carboxylate, aromatic carboxylate, halogen-containing carboxylate, hydroxy carboxylate, sulfate, nitrate, phosphate, phosphonate, hydrogen phosphate, hydrogen sulfide, sulfite, thiosulfate, hydrochloride, hydrobromate, chlorate and bromate, organic sulfonates, organic sulfates, chelate compounds and oxides.  Among these, alkaline metal or alkaline earth metal saturated aliphatic carboxylates particularly acetates are preferably used from the viewpoint of easy handling and easy availability.<br>
In a preferable embodiment, a cobalt compound is further added in an amount of less than 10 ppm in terms of cobalt atom to the polyester polymerization catalyst of this invention.  The amount thereof is more preferably less than 5 ppm, more preferably 3 ppm.<br>
It is known that the cobalt compound itself has<br><br>
a polymerization activity at a certain degree, but when it is added in such an amount as to exhibit a sufficient catalytic effect, the brightness or thermal stability of the resultant polyester polymer is lowered.  The polyester obtained according to this invention is excellent color tone and thermal stability, and by adding the cobalt compound in such a small amount that the catalytic effect thereof is not evident, the discoloration of the resultant polyester can be effectively diminished without causing a reduction in the brightness of the polyester.  The object of the cobalt compound in this invention is to diminish discoloration, and the cobalt compound may be added at any stage of polymerization or after polymerization reaction or at any stage after polymerization reaction until molding*<br>
The cobalt compound is not particularly limited, and specific examples thereof include cobalt acetate, cobalt nitrate, cobalt chloride, cobalt acetyl acetonate and cobalt naphthenate or hydrates thereof. Among these, cobalt acetate tetrahydrate is particularly preferable.<br>
Production of polyester according to the present invention can be carried out in the same manner as in the conventional process except that the polyester<br><br>
polymerization catalyst of this invention is used as the catalyst.  For example , PET is produced by a direct esterification method wherein terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol and if necessary other copolymerizable components are directly reacted to form an ester while water is distilled away, followed by polycondensation under reduced pressure or by a transesterification method wherein dimethyl terephthalate and ethylene glycol and if necessary other copolymerizable components are directly reacted for<br>
transesterification while methyl alcohol is distilled away, followed by polycondensation under reduced pressure. If necessary, solid state polymerization may also be conducted in order to increase the intrinsic viscosity and to lower the content of acetaldehyde. For promotion of crystallization before solid state polymerization, melt-polymerized polyester is allowed to absorb water vapor and then crystallized by heating, orpolyester chips are sprayed directly with water vapor and then crystallized by heating.<br>
The melt polycondensation reaction may be conducted in a reaction unit in a batch system or a reaction unit in a continuous system.  In either system, the esterification reaction or transesterification may be conducted at one stage or divided stages.  The<br><br>
melt polycondensation reaction may also be conducted at one stage or divided stages.  The solid state polymerization reaction, similar to the melt polycondensation reaction, can be conducted in a reaction unit in a batch system or a reaction unit in a continuous system.  The melt polycondensation and solid state polymerization can be conducted continuously or successively.<br>
Hereinafter, the process for producing polyethylene terephthalate in a continuous system is described in detail by reference to a preferable embodiment.<br>
First, production of a oligomer by esterification reaction is described. Slurry containing 1.02 to 1.5 moles, preferably 1.03 to 1.4 moles of ethylene glycol per mole of terephthalic acid or an ester derivative thereof is prepared and fed continuously to the esterification reaction process.<br>
The esterification reaction is conducted with ethylene glycol refluxed in a multistage unit consisting of 1 to 3 esterification reactors connected in series, during which water or alcohol formed by the reaction is discharged from the reaction system through a distillation column.  The temperature in the esterification reaction at the first stage is 240 to<br><br>
270 °C, preferably 245 to 265 °C, the pressure is 0.2 to 3 kg/cm2G, preferably 0.5 to 2 kg/cm2G.  The temperature in the esterification reaction at the final stage is usually 250 to 290 °C, preferably 255 to 275 °C, and the pressure is usually 0 to 1.5 kg/cm2G, preferably 0 to 1.3 kg/cm2G.  When the reaction is conducted at three or more stages, the reaction conditions for intermediate stages are intermediate conditions between the conditions at the first stage and final stage.  The degree of the esterification reaction is preferably evenly increased at the respective stages.  Desirably, the degree of esterification finally attains 90 % or more, preferably 93 % or more.  By these esterification reactions, low-condensed products of molecular weights of about 500 to 5000 can be obtained.<br>
When terephthalic acid is used as the starting material, the esterification reaction can be conducted in the absence of a catalyst because terephthalic acid has a catalytic activity as the acid, but the reaction may also be conducted in the coexistence of a polymerization catalyst.<br>
Because the ratio of dioxyethylene terephthalate units in a major chain of polyethylene terephthalate can be kept at a low level (5 mol-% or less relative<br><br>
to the whole total diol components),, the reaction is carried out preferably in thepresence of a small amount of tertiary amines such as triethylamine, tri-n-butylamine andbenzyl dimethylamine , quaternary ammonium hydroxides such as tetraethyl ammonium hydroxide, tetra-n-butyl ammonium hydroxide and trimethy1 benzyl ammonium hydroxide, and basic compounds such as lithium carbonate, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate and sodium acetate.<br>
When a oligomer is produced by transesterification reaction, a solution containing ethylene glycol in an amount of 1.1 to 1.6 moles, preferably 1.2 to 1.5 moles per mole of dimethyl terephthalate is prepared and fed continuously to the transesterification reaction process.<br>
The transesterification reaction is conducted with ethylene glycol refluxed in a multistage unit consisting of 1 or 2 esterification reactors connected in series , during which methanol formed by the reaction is discharged from the reaction system through a distillation column.  The temperature of the transesterif ication reaction at the firet stage is 180<br>
to 250 °C, preferably 200 to 240 °C.  The temperature of the transesterification reaction at the final stage<br>
is usually 230 to 270 °C, preferably 240 to 265 °C, and<br><br>
Zn Cd, Mgr Mn, Co, Ca and Ba fatty acid salts and carboxylic acid salts, and Pbr Zn, Sb and Ge oxides are used as the transesterification catalyst. Low-condensed products with molecular weight of about 200 to 500 are obtained by these transesterification reactions.<br>
Then, the resultant low-condensed products are fed to a multistage liquid phase polycondensation process.  The polycondensation reaction conditions are selected such that the temperature for the polycondensation reaction at the first reaction stage<br>
is 250 to 290 °C, preferably 260 to 280 °C, the pressure is 500 to 20 Torr, preferably 200 to 30 Torr, and the temperature for the polycondensation reaction at the<br>
final stage is 265 to 300 °C, preferably 275 to 295 °C, and the pressure is 10 to 0.1 Torr, preferably 5 to 0.5 Torr. When the reaction is carried out at three or more stages, the reaction conditions for the polycondensation reaction at intermediate stages are intermediate conditions between the reaction conditions at the first stage and final stage. The increase in the intrinsic viscosity is achieved evenly at the respective polycondensation reaction stages. When a low content of acetaldehyde or a low content of cyclic trimers in e.g. low-flavor drinks or<br><br>
heat-resistant hollow molded articles for mineral water is required, the melt-polycondensed polyester thus obtained is subjected to solid state polymerization.  The polyester is subjected to solid state polymerization in a method known in the art. First, the polyester to be subjected to solid state polymerization is preliminarily crystallized by<br>
heating at a temperature of 100 to 210 °C for 1 to 5 hours in an inert gas or under reduced pressure or in an atmosphere of inert gas containing or not containing water vapor.  Then, solid state polymerization is<br>
carried out at a temperature of 190 to 230 °C for 1 to 30 hours in an inert gas atmosphere or under reduced pressure.<br>
The catalyst of this invention has a catalytic activity not only in polymerization reaction but also in esterification reaction and transesterification reaction.  For example, polymerization by transesterification reaction between an alkyl dicarboxylate such as dimethyl terephthalate and a glycol such as ethylene glycol is conducted usually in the presence of an transesterif ication catalyst such as a titanium compound or a zinc compound, but the catalyst of this invention can also be used in place of such catalyst or in the coexistence of such catalyst*<br><br>
Further, the catalyst of this invention also has a catalytic activity not only in melt polymerization but also in solid state polymerization and solution polymerization, and in any methods, polyester can be produced.<br>
The polymerization catalyst of this invention can be added to the reaction system at an arbitrary stage of the polymerization reaction.  For example, the catalyst can be added to the reaction system before esterification reaction or transesterification reaction or at an arbitrary stage of the reaction or just before polycondensation reaction or at an arbitrary stage of the polycondensation reaction.  In particular, aluminum or a compound thereof is added preferably just before polycondensation reaction.<br>
The method of the addition of the polymerization catalyst of this invention is not particularly limited, and the catalyst may be added in a powdery or neat state or in the form of a solution or slurry in a solvent such as ethylene glycol.  Further, the constituent components of the polymerization catalyst of this invention may be added as a mixture, or these may be added separately.  Further, the constituent components of the polymerization catalyst of this invention may be added to the polymerization system<br><br>
at the same stage, or these may be added at different stages -<br>
To improve the productivity of polyester by shortening the polymerization time, the polymerization catalyst of this invention may be used preferably in the coexistence of another polymerization catalyst such as an antimony compound, a titanium compound, a germanium compound or a tin compound in such an amount as not to cause the above-described problems in the properties and productivity of polyester, coloration of its product, etc.<br>
In this case, the antimony compound can be added in an amount of 50 ppm in terms of antimony atom relative to polyester obtained by polymerization . The antimony compound is added more preferably in an amount of 30 ppm or less. An amount of antimony greater than 50 ppm is not preferable because an antimony metal is precipitated to cause gray discoloration or to generate insoluble particles in polyester.<br>
The titanium compound can be added in the range of 10 ppm or less relative to the polymer obtained by polymerization. The titanium compound is added in an amount of preferably 5 ppm or less, more preferably 2 ppm or less. When the amount of titanium added is greater than 10 ppm, the thermal stability of the<br><br>
resultant resin is significantly degraded.<br>
The germanium compound can be added in an amount of 20 ppm or less in terms of germanium atom in the polyester obtained by polymerization. The germanium compound is added more preferably in an amount of 10 ppm or less . An amount of germanium greater than 20 ppm is economically disadvantageous and thus not preferable.<br>
When polyester is polymerized by using the polymerization catalyst of this invention, an antimony compound, titanium compound, germanium compound and tin compound can be used alone or in combination thereof.<br>
