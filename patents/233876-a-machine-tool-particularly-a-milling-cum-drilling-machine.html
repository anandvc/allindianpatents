				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a machine tool, particularly a milling and drilling<br>
machine comprising a rigid base on which an inclined support surface directed<br>
forwards/upwards is formed, at least one workpiece support rotatable about the<br>
central axis of said support surface and including a support supported on the<br>
support surface so as to be rotatable about its central axis and a workpiece table<br>
provided on a bent support portion of the base, the axis of said workpiece table<br>
forming an acute angle with the central axis of the support surface, and at least<br>
one machining unit shiftable along coordinate axes and including exchangeable<br>
tools.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
From the EP 0 721 819 B1 a milling and drilling machine for machining a<br>
workpiece in a plurality of axes in one clamping is known which comprises a<br>
machining unit shiftable along coordinate axes on a rigid machine column by<br>
means of a motor and including a vertical spindle head. On the front surface of<br>
the machine column a recess is provided the bottom of which, extending<br>
forwards and upwards by 45°, serves as a support surface for the support of a<br>
workpiece support. The support is rotatable about the central axis of the support<br>
surface which is inclined by 45°, and it comprises an, as viewed from above,<br>
circular foot as well as a support shoulder formed integrally therewith. A support<br>
surface formed on said support shoulder is inclined by 45° with respect to the<br>
rotational axis of the support and serves as a support surface for a workpiece<br>
table which may be formed as a round table rotatable about its central axis by<br>
means of a motor. The recess and its bottom extending forwards and upwards<br>
by 45° as well as the workpiece support rotatably supported thereon are<br>
disposed on the machine column in its vertical central<br>
plane. By rotating the workpiece support about its central axis on the support surface<br>
the workpiece table can be turned into a horizontal machining and clamping position, a<br>
vertical position as well as intermediate postures and fixed in each of said positions so<br>
that a clamped workpiece can be machined by means of the vertical spindle in a plurality<br>
of axes in one clamping. However, no back surface undercuts may be produced with this<br>
machine.<br>
Other machine tools comprising workpiece supports rotatably disposed on a surface<br>
inclined by 45° are, for example, known from the DE 3590 093 T and from the US 4644<br>
635. On these machines the workpiece table can also be moved from a horizontal<br>
position into a vertical position by means of a motor so that a clamped workpiece can be<br>
machined vertically and horizontally.<br>
OBJECT OF INVENTION<br>
It is the object of the invention to provide a machine tool, particularly a milling and<br>
drilling machine having an extended machining area and in particular enabling back<br>
surface undercuts on a workpiece.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
According to the invention said object is solved by disposing the support surface<br>
extending obliquely forwards and upwards and serving as a support for the workpiece<br>
support laterally offset with respect to the vertical central plane of the base so that its<br>
central axis forms an acute angle with the vertical central plane of the base and the<br>
workpiece table assumes a posture in which it is tilted forward in an intermediate<br>
position within a rotational angle range.<br>
In case of the machine tool designed in accordance with the invention the workpiece<br>
table can be moved into a vertical position as well as intermediate postures from a<br>
horizontal posture by a rotation of the workpiece support, i.e. the base including the<br>
workpiece table, about the central axis of the laterally offset, inclined support surface<br>
and accurately and stably fixed in each of said positions by suitable fixation<br>
means, for example in the form of clamping elements, centring studs and / or<br>
position controlled motors. In the horizontal and vertical basic positions work can<br>
be carried out in the way known from the cited EP 0721 819 B1. The advantages<br>
of this known milling and drilling machine over conventional machine types, such<br>
as the convenient accessibility of the work space, the stable support of the<br>
workpiece support on the base due to the large bearing surface of the base on<br>
the support surface, are also given in the machine tool according to the<br>
invention. According to the invention the new machine additionally provides the<br>
possibility to move the workpiece table, within a predetermined rotational angle<br>
range, into a forward tilted posture in which the back surface of clamped<br>
workpieces can be machined by means of a simple vertical spindle-without a<br>
pivotable head- and, for example, undercuts can be produced in the workpiece.<br>
According to an efficient embodiment of the invention the angle between the<br>
central axis of the support surface forming the rotational axis of the workpiece<br>
support and the axis of the workpiece table in the vertical plane extending<br>
through said central axis is greater than 45° in a predetermined range, a certain<br>
maximum degree of overhang of the workpiece table being obtained by<br>
determining this angle. The degree of the lateral offset of the workpiece support<br>
and the inclined spatial orientation of its central axis are determined in<br>
accordance with this angle.<br>
To increase the productivity a further development of the invention is<br>
characterized in that two workpiece supports are provided on two inclined<br>
support surfaces disposed on both sides of the vertical<br>
central plane of a base. In this way a workpiece may be clamped to the second<br>
workpiece table while another one is machined.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS.<br>
An embodiment of the invention will be described in detail below with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings in which:<br>
Fig. 1 is a perspective view of a milling and drilling machine;<br>
Figs 2a to 2c, show the base of a milling and drilling machine as well as a workpiece<br>
support in various operating positions;<br>
Fig. 3 is a schematic top view of the base of a milling and drilling machine and the<br>
workpiece support;<br>
Fig. 4 is a schematic side view of the workpiece support.<br>
DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The universal milling and drilling machine shown in Fig. 1 comprises a rigid base 1<br>
resting on the floor or foundation via feet 2. On the front side of said base 1 a pan 6 for<br>
collecting chips and machining liquids and defined by side walls 3,4 and an inclined rear<br>
wall 5 is provided. According to Fig. 1 the pan 6 is defined by an inclined, forwards and<br>
upwards pointing support surface 8 at its right side which forms a support for a<br>
workpiece support. The support surface 8 is formed laterally offset with respect to the<br>
vertical central plane 32 of the base 1 on a lateral portion of the base 1 and oriented so<br>
that its spatially obliquely extending central axis 15 forms an acute spatial angle 0 with a<br>
vertical longitudinal plane, in this case the vertical central plane 32.<br>
The workpiece support 10 comprises a support 11 including a circular foot 12 and a bent<br>
support member 13 integrally formed thereon, a workpiece table 14 being mounted on<br>
the upper side of said support member 13. The workpiece table 14 may be formed as a<br>
rotationally driven round table. The circular foot 12 of the support 11 is extensively<br>
supported on the support surface 8 of the base 1 and<br>
rotatable about the central axis 15 of the support surface 8 and the<br>
support foot 12 extending in the acute spatial angle 8 by means of a<br>
motor so that the workpiece support 10 can be rotated about its axis<br>
15 in both senses of rotation. The support 11 can be fixed in any ro-<br>
tational position with respect to the support surface 8 by means of<br>
fixation means (not shown), e.g. latches, clamping elements or posi-<br>
tion controlled electric motors. Further a rounded front recess 16<br>
enabling a collision-free rotation of the workpiece support 10 about<br>
the central axis 15 is formed on the face of the base 1 on the, accord-<br>
ing to Fig. 1, left side of the inclined support surface 8.<br>
According to the milling and drilling machine shown in Fig. 1 a<br>
support 20 having, in this case, a U-shaped cross section is mounted<br>
on the base 1, a guide rail 21, 22 being mounted on each of the two<br>
upper legs of said support 20, respectively. On the guide rails 21, 22<br>
a slide 23 comprising two guide rails provided in a distance to each<br>
other on the upper side and serving as supports for a housing 25<br>
shiftable in the direction of the Y-axis, is supported so as to be mov-<br>
able along the X-coordinate axis. On the vertical face of the housing<br>
25 a machining unit 26 comprising a driven work spindle 29 having a<br>
vertical spindle axis 30 as well as a spindle drive is shiftable in verti-<br>
cal guides 27, 28. Instead of the vertical spindle head 26 horizontal<br>
spindles and so called pivotable heads comprising a pivotable work<br>
spindle may be used.<br>
Figs. 2a, b and c show the base 1 including the column 20 and<br>
the workpiece support 10 in various perspective views, the workpiece<br>
table 14 being respectively located in different positions. According to<br>
Fig. 2a the workpiece table 14 is disposed in a horizontal basic posi-<br>
tion also shown in Fig. 1 in which workpieces are machined by<br>
means of the vertical spindle 29. Of the work spindle only the spindle<br>
axis 30 is indicated by a bold broken line here. As can be seen from<br>
Figs. 1 and 2a the clamping grooves in the workpiece table 14 do not<br>
- as usually - extend parallel to the X- or Y-coordinate axis but in an<br>
acute angle. When a rotationally driven round table 14 is used the<br>
conventional table position with the clamping grooves extending par-<br>
allel to the X-coordinate axis as well as any other position of the<br>
workpiece table can be obtained by a rotation about the table axis 34.<br>
In the second basic position shown in Fig. 2b the workpiece<br>
support 10 is rotated about its axis 15 by a predetermined angle on<br>
the inclined support surface 8 so that the workpiece table 14 is dis-<br>
posed in a vertical position. In the position shown the workpiece table<br>
14 rotatable about its axis 34 is rotated so that its clamping grooves<br>
are oriented in the direction of the X-coordinate axis. By rotating the<br>
workpiece table 14 all sides of a clamped workpiece can be machined<br>
in the conventional way with a tool inserted in the vertical work spin-<br>
dle.<br>
When the workpiece support 10 is rotated about its rotational<br>
axis 15, i.e. the central axis 15 of the support surface 8, by 180° to-<br>
gether with the horizontal workpiece table 14 from the basic position<br>
shown in Fig. 2a into the position shown in Fig. 2c the workpiece ta-<br>
ble 14 and the clamped workpiece (not shown) are moved in a tilted<br>
position. A tool clamped in the vertical work spindle indicated by its<br>
axis 30 can produce back surface undercuts in this table position.<br>
The undercuts can be produced on each side of the workpiece by ro-<br>
tating the workpiece table 14 about its central axis 34. This effect is<br>
achieved by an interaction of the lateral offset of the workpiece sup-<br>
port 10 and the special inclined orientation of its rotational axis 15.<br>
In the schematic views shown in Figs. 3 and 4 the angles for the<br>
embodiment of the invention shown in detail in Fig. 1 are indicated,<br>
the workpiece table 14 being shown in its horizontal basic position.<br>
As can be seen in Fig. 3 the angle a between the vertical central plane<br>
32 and the rotational axis 15 of the workpiece support 10 determin-<br>
ing the lateral offset of the workpiece support 10 is about 45,6° in the<br>
plane of the drawing.<br>
Fig. 4 is a schematic side view of the workpiece support 10 in a<br>
direction parallel to the oblique surface 8 of the base 1, i.e. in the di-<br>
rection of the arrow 33 in Fig. 1, the workpiece table 14 being shown<br>
in the horizontal basic position shown in Fig. 1. The workpiece sup-<br>
port 10 is formed so that the angle (3 between its rotational axis 15<br>
and the rotational axis 34 of the workpiece table 14 is 55° in the il-<br>
lustrated embodiment. The selection and interrelated adjustment of<br>
the two angles a and (3 determine the tilting degree of the workpiece<br>
table 1.4.<br>
A particular advantage of the invention is the relatively large<br>
workspace also existing in the intermediate position of the workpiece<br>
table 14 shown in Fig. 2c and resulting from the laterally offset posi-<br>
tion of the support surface 8 with respect to the central plane 32 in<br>
functional connection with the inclined orientation of the workpiece<br>
support 10 according to the invention. Further it is advantageous<br>
that the milling head 26 moves only along one axis during the ma-<br>
chining of the workpiece in the positions of the workpiece support 10<br>
shown e.g. in Fig. 2c.<br>
The invention is not limited to the illustrated embodiment. The<br>
inclined table arrangement according to the invention may also be<br>
used for so-called bed machines in which at least one workpiece sup-<br>
port is provided on a machine bed which can be regarded as a part of<br>
the machine base. The inclined support surface forming the support<br>
for the rotatable workpiece support and having a central axis serving<br>
as the rotational axis for the workpiece support and forming an acute<br>
spatial angle with a vertical longitudinal plane of the machine bed<br>
may be arranged on the machine bed or a column so as to be laterally<br>
offset with respect to the vertical central plane of the machine with a<br>
correspondingly adjusted oblique orientation of its central axis. Such<br>
a column may also be shiftable on the machine bed in corresponding<br>
guides. Further two of the workpiece supports described in detail<br>
above may be formed on a base, preferably on both sides of the verti-<br>
cal central plane.<br>
Further the technical concept of the invention may also be ap-<br>
plied to machining units of a milling and drilling machine comprising<br>
a milling or spindle head. In this case a spatially inclined support<br>
surface corresponding the inclined support surface 8 of the machine<br>
described above is formed on a vertical or horizontal slide or head-<br>
stock guided on the machine column so as to be shiftable along at<br>
least one coordinate axis. On said inclined support surface a support<br>
is supported so as to be rotatable about its central axis. The central<br>
axis of the support surface extends in a spatial angle 9 with respect<br>
to a vertical plane. On a bent front or side portion of the support pro-<br>
vided opposite of the inclined support surface a spindle head includ-<br>
ing a rotationally driven work spindle is provided. The vertical and<br>
horizontal orientation of the work spindle as well as, in addition, a<br>
plurality of spatially inclined spindle positions, for example for the<br>
production of back surface undercuts, are obtained by a suitable se-<br>
lection and interrelated adjustment of the spatial angle. The advan-<br>
tage compared to known fork heads is the substantially higher overall<br>
rigidity due to the extensive support of the pivotable head on the in-<br>
clined support surface enabling a high machining performance and<br>
accuracy.<br>
