				<td>INTRODUCTION:<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of 4-fluoro-oc-(2-mono- or disubstituted-aminoethyl)phenylmethanols. The 4-fluoro-oc-(2-mono- or di-substitutedaminoethyl)phenylmethanols prepared by the process of the present invention have the general formula-I given below:<br><br>
wherein, R" = H, R" = methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, isopropyl, cyclopropyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, phenylmethyl, etc.; R" &amp; R" may also be methyl, ethyl, propyl, phenylmethyl, etc.; and R" and R" together may form piperidino, morpholino, pyrrolidino, N-methylpiperazino, N-ethylpiperazino, etc.<br>
Compounds of the formula-I where R" = H, R" = Me is an important intermediate for the synthesis of (±)-trans-4-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-hyroxymethyl-l-methylpiperidine of the formula-II given below. The compound of the formula-II is an advanced intermediate widely used for the synthesis of antidepressant drug, paroxetine hydrochloride of the formula-Ill. Paroxetine hydrochloride is commercially available in the market as an anti¬depressant, which inhibits 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) reuptake.<br><br><br>
8ACKGROUND OF INVENTION:<br>
Compound of the formula-I where R" = H, R" = Me, (4-fluoro-x-(2-methylamino-ethyl)phenylmethanol) is prepared for the first time by us and effectively used in constructing the piperidine ring of paroxetine. Details of this invention are disclosed in our pending Indian Patent application no 830/MAS/2002. In that patent application we have described two routes for the preparation of compound of the formula-I.<br>
In the first route (Scheme-I shown below) the Mannich salt of the formula-IV is reduced with a reducing agent to get the hydroxy compound of the formula-V. The resulting hydroxy compound of the formula-V is debenzylated under hydrogenation conditions to get the required compound of the formula-I.<br>
Although this process is attractive for a commercial scale, we have observed that one major drawback of this process is that defluorination is also possible during debenzylation step resulting in x-(2-methyl-aminoethyl)phenylmethanol of the formula-VI. Removal of this impurity of the formula-VI to an acceptable level (
 <br><br>
In the second route for the preparation of compound of the formula-I, we started with a different Mannich salt and completed the synthesis of the compound of the formula-I (Scheme-II shown below). The compound of the formula-VIII is reacted with a reducing agent to get the hydroxy compound of the formula-IX. This compound of the formula-IX is reacted with a chlorofomate derivative to get the urethane derivative of the formula-X. The urethane derivative of the formula-X is hydrolyzed with alkali to get the compound of the formula-I, free from the impurity of the formula-VI.<br>
One major drawback in this process is a large excess (at least 4-6 molar equivalents) of chloroformate is required to make the urethane derivative of the formula-X which leads to the cost escalation of the process and also creating environmental pollution problems. Also, the hydrolysis step is slow and requiring high temperature (100-140°C) causing slow rate of reaction leading to less production. Further, prolonged heating at higher temperature (in the plant scale) may lead to color and quality problems of the final compound of the formula-I.<br><br>
Scheme-II Keeping in view of the difficulties in the above-mentioned processes we continued our R &amp; D for developing an alternative, simple, economical and commercially applicable process for the preparation of compound of the formula-I.   Our efforts were successful and an improved, simple, economical and commercially applicable process could be<br><br>
developed Also, this process is general and applicable to make various 4-fluoro-oc-(2-mono- or disubstituted-aminoethyl)phenyl-methanols of the formula-I.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of compound of formula-I,<br><br>
wherein, R" = H, R" = methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, isopropyl, cyclopropyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl,  phenylmethyl; R"  &amp; R"     may also represent  methyl,  ethyl,  propyl, phenylmethyl; R" &amp; R"   together may form   piperidino, morpholino, pyrrolidino, N-methylpiperidino, N-ethylpiperidino or its acid addition sahs which comprises: (i)       Reacting  the chloro compound of the formula-XII<br><br>
with sodium iodide in acetone medium at reflux temperature to get the iodo compound of formula-XIII,<br><br>
(ii)      Reacting the resulting compound of the formula-XIII with the amine of formula-XIV,<br>
R"R"NH XIV<br><br>
Wherein,<br>
R" = H, R" = methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, isopropyl, cyclopropyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, phenylmethyl; R" &amp;R" represent methyl, ethyl, propyl, phenylmethyl; R" &amp; R" together may form piperidino, morpholino, pyrrolidino, N-methylpiperidino, N-ethylpiperidino in alcoholic or aqueous or both at a temperatutre in the range of ambient to 200°C.<br>
(iii)     Isolating the resulting compound of the formula-I by removal of the alcoholic<br>
solvent by distillation under reduced pressure (iv)      Suspending the residue in water and extracting the compound of the formula-I<br>
into non-polar solvent (v)      Distilling the solvent and isolating the compound of the formula-I by<br>
distillation or crystallization and if required (vi)      Purifying the compound of the formula I by crystallization and (vii)     Preparing the acid addition salts thereof by conventional methods<br>

be prepared by the process described in Suom. Kemistilehti B 1970, 43(12), 512-16; CA; 74, 63686b.<br>
