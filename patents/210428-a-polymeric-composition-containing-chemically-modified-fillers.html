DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to chemically 10 modified fillers and the use of such fillers in polymeric<br>
compositions. More particularly, this invention relates to     particulate or amorphous fillers haying minimum carbon and sulfur contents, a minimum Silane Conversion Index and a minimum Standard Tensile Stress @ 3 00% elongation and 15 polymers, e.g., curable rubber compositions, containing such fillers. Most particularly, this invention relates to a functionaliaed and hydrophobized filler, hereinafter referred to as a modified filler", that improves the efficiency of producing polymeric compositions, such as in rubber 21} compounding, and the performance of polymerized or cured products, e.g., tires.<br>
In the production of polymeric, compositions, it is common to incorporate fillers to improve the physical  properties of the polymer.  The surfaces of such fillers are . 25 often modified, to increase the reactivity and consequently the two and three dimensional coupling of the filler within the  polymeric composition.  It is conventional in the rubber, industry to incorporate carbon black and other reinforcing . fillers into natural and synthetic rubber to increase the 30 physical properties of the cured rubber vulcanizate.  Fillers used to reinforce such polymeric compositions include natural . and synthetic fillers..<br><br><br>
One of the principal non-black fillers used in the rubber industry is amorphous precipitated silica  This siliceous filler is used to impart improved tensile strength, tear resistance and abrasion resistance to the rubber 5 vulcanizate. Silica fillers are also used in combination with carbon blacks to obtain maximum mileage in passenger vehicle tires and off the road tires, e.g., tires for mining and logging operations and for road-building equipment. . Such applications have become well established. When used as the<br>
10  sole reinforcing filler, silica fillers that are not well dispersed and/or coupled in the rubber do not provide the overall improved performance obtained by the use of carbon blacks alone This is observed most readily in rubber vulcanizes used for tires, e.g., tire treads.<br>
15	Various coupling agents, e.g., titanates,<br>
zirconattes and silones, have been suggested for use. with fillers when such fillers are incorporated into polymeric compositions,, e.g., rubber, in order to improve the performance of the rubber vulcanizate. Among the various<br>
20  organosilane coupling agents suggested for. such use are the bis (alkoxysilylalkyl)polysulfides, e.g., 3,3"-bis(triethoxy-  silylpropyl) tetrasulfide.  It has been reported that the use of appropriate amounts of such coupling.agents, particularly 3,3-bis(triethoxysilylpropyl)tetrasulfide, in siliceous<br>
25  filler-reinforced synthetic rubbers provides at least<br>
equivalent performance to carbon black-reinforced synthetic rubbers in several key physical properties such as 300% modulus, tensile strength and abrasion resistance.<br>
The high cost of bis (alkoxysilylalkyl)polysulfides,<br>
30  and the time and energy required to mix them into polymeric compositions have deterred the more general use of siliceous . fillers as the principal reinforcing filler in large volume<br><br>
WO 01/12734<br><br>
PCT/US00/22713<br><br>
applications.  U.S. Patent 4,436,847 describes increasing the efficiency of silane coupling agents, e.g., bis(alkoxysilyl-alkyl)polysulfide coupling agents, by using an alkoxysilane in combination with the silane to form a coupling composition.<br>
5  In one specific embodiment described in the 847 patent, the silane coupling composition is formulated with the siliceous filler in a suitable non-reactive liquid that is chemically inert with respect to the coupling composition and siliceous filler to prepare a rubber compounding additive, i.e., a<br>
10 silica-silane concentrate.<br>
U.S. patent 5,116,886 describes a two-step process in which the surface of natural or synthetic, oxide or silicate fillers is modified by using certain organosilicon compounds.  In the first step, the organosilicon compound is<br>
15 mixed intensely with the filler at a temperature below G0°C. In the second step, the homogenous mixture is subjected to a temperature of from 60 to 160°C to complete the surface modification of the filler.<br>
U.S. patent 5,908,660 also describes a two-step<br>
20 method for the preparation of hydrophobic silica.  In the first step, an aqueous suspension of precipitated silica is contacted with an organosilicon compound in the presence of a catalytic amount of an acid to effect hydrophobizing of the precipitated silica.  In the second step, the aqueous<br>
IS     suspension of the hydrophobic precipitated silica is contacted with a water-immiscible organic solvent at a solvent to silica weight ratio greater than 5:1 to effect separation of the hydrophobic precipitated silica from the aqueous phase.<br>
It has now been discovered that a modified filler,<br>
30  e.g., a particulate or amorphous inorganic oxide, that is characterized by a carbon content of greater than l weight percent, a sulfur content of greater than 0.1 weight percent,<br><br><br>
a Silane Conversion Index (described hereinafter) of at least..<br>
0,3 and a Standard Tensile Stress ® 300% elongation (also<br>
described hereinafter) of  7 or more can be prepared;  The<br>
process described in U.s, Patent 5,908,660 may be improved and<br>
used to produce the modified filler of the present invention.<br>
by utilizing a certain combination of functionalizing and .<br>
hydrophobizing agents in an aqueous suspension, of inorganic<br>
oxide having a pH of 2.5 or less and treating the acidic,<br>
aqueous suspension of modified fillers with acid neutralizing<br>
agents to increase the pH of Che suspension to a range of from<br>
3.0 to 10.	<br>
As used herein, a functionalizing agent is a<br>
reactive chemical which can cause an inorganic oxide to be covalently bonded to the polymeric composition in which it is used,  A hydrophobizing agent is a chemical which can bind to and/or be associated with an inorganic oxide to the extant that it causes a reduction, in the. affinity for water of the inorganic oxide while increasing the inorganic oxide"s affinity for the organic polymeric composition in which it is Used.<br>
The aforementioned Standard Tensile Stress ® 300% elongation (STS®300%)   of at least 7 or greater indicates improved reinforcement of the rubber composition.  Improved reinforcement translates into an improvement in the mechanical durability of -the product which is  evidenced by increasec tear strength, hardness and abrasion resistance.  In addition to the improved properties, the modified filler has-the benefit of requiring less time and energy to get incorporated into the polymeric composition.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Other than in the operating example, or where otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing quantities., ratios, ranges etc. used herein are to be understood as modified in all instances by the term "about".<br>
The modified filler of the present invention may be produced by any method that results in such a filler, i.e., an inorganic oxids, having a carbon content of greater than 1 weight percent, preferably, at least 1.5 weight percent, and more preferably, at. least 2.0 weight percent, a sulfur content of greater than 0.1 weight percent, preferably, at least 0.3 weight: percent, and more preferably., at least 0.6 weight percent; a Silane Conversion index, of at least.0.3, preferably, at least 0.4, and most preferably, at least 0.5 and a Standard Tensile Stress ® 300% elongation of at least 7.0, preferably, at least 7,5 and more preferably at least 8.0,  The modified filler of the present invention may also be characterized by a modified Brunauer-Emmett -Teller (BET) i.e., a single point surface area, of from 20 to 350-m2/g, preferably from 40 to 3 00 m2/g and most preferably of from 100 to 200 m2/g, a pH of from S to 10, preferably from 5.5 to 9.S, more preferably from 6.0 to 9 .0 and most preferably, a pH of from 6.0 to 7.5  or the pH of the product may range between any combination of these values, inclusive of the recited ranges; and a Soxhlet Extractable percent carbon of less than 3 0 percent preferably less than 25 percent and more preferably less than 20 percent, e,g., is percent. The. methods for determining the aforestated characteristics of the modified, inorganic oxide are described in Example 9.<br>
The filler used to prepare the modified filler of the present invention is an inorganic oxide defined herein as any inorganic particulate, or amorphous solid material  here<br><br><br>
possesses either oxygen (chemisorbed or covalently bonded) or hydroxyl (bound or free) ac its exposed surface.  In addition, the inorganic oxide is a material which is suitable for use in the various molding, compounding or coating processes including injection molding, lamination, transfer molding, compression molding, rubber compounding, coating (such as dipping, brushing, knife coating, roller coating, silk screen coating, printing, spray coating and the like), casting, and the like.<br>
The inorganic oxide or mixture of 2 or more inorganic oxides used to produce the modified filler of the present invention may be natural or synthetic  Such fillers include oxides of the metals in Periods 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of Groups Ib, IIb, IIIa,, IIIb, IVa, IVb (except carbon), Va, VIa, VIIa and VIII of the Periodic Table Of the Elements in<br>
Advanced,. Inorganic Chemistry: A	Comprehensive Text by F.<br>
Albert Cotton et al, Fourth Edition, John Wiley and Sons, 1580. Among the natural silicates, kaolines or clays are especially suitable  However, kieselguhr or diatomaceous earths can  also be used.  Aluminum oxide, aluminum hydroxide or aluminum trihydrate and titanium dioxide, which can be obtained from natural deposits, can be named by way of example as Cillers.  Especially suitable synthetic fillers are aluminosilicates, silicates, pyrogenic, colloidal and precipitated silicas.<br>
The term "aluminosilicates" can be described as natural or synthetic materials where the silicon atoms of a silicon dioxide are partially replaced, or substituted, either naturally oi synthetically, by aluminum atoms.  For example, 5 to 90,   alternatively 10 to 80 percent of silicon atoms of a silicon dioxide might be replaced, or substituted, naturally o- sv-ithetically, by aluminum atoms to yield an<br><br>
aluminosilicats.  A suitable process for such preparation might be described, for example,, as by a coprecipitation by pH adjustment of a basic solution, or mixture, of silicate and aluminate of,   for example, by a chemical reaction between SiO2, or silanols on the surface of a silicon dioxide, and NaAlO2.  For example, in such a coprecipitation process, the. synthetic coprecipitated alurninosilicate. may have"5 to 55 of its; surface composed of silica moieties and, correspondingly, 95 to 5 percent of its surface composed of aluminum moieties.<br>
Examples of natural aluminosilicates include Muscovite, Beryl, Dichroite, Sepiolite and Kaolinire. Examples of synthetic aluminosilicaces include Zeolite and those which might be represented by formulas such as, for example, [(Al2O3)x (Si02)y.(H20) ,  ]; ((Al2O3),{Si02) yY0] ; wherein Y is magnesium or calcium,<br>
Preferably, the inorganic oxide used to produce the modified filler of the present invention is aluminosilicate, colloidal silica, precipitated silica or mixtures thereof, and most preferably it is a precipitated silica of the type commonly employed for compounding with rubber, various commercially available silicas that may be considered for use . in this invention include silicas commercially available from PFG  Industries under the Hi-Sil trademark with designations 210, 243, etc; silicas availably from Rhone-Poulenc, with, for example, designations of Z1165MP and Z165GR and silicas available from Degussa AG with, for example, designations VN2 and VN3, etc.<br>
The precipitated silica used to produce the modified filler of the present invention may be produced, for example, by acidic precipitation from solutions of silicates, e.g., sodium silicate.  The method of preparing the recipitated silica is not limiting on the present invention<br><br>
and will depend upon the desired properties of the silica,<br>
such as surface area and particle size required for a given<br>
application,	<br>
The BET surface area of  the precipitated silica used in preparing the modified silica of the present invention will generally be within a range of from 50 m2/g  to 1000 m2/g, and will preferably be within a range of from 100 m2/g to 500<br>
The precipitated silica used to form the modified silica may be in the  form of an aqueous suspension from production stages that precede the drying step, such as a slurry formed during precipitation or as a reliquefied filter cake.  The suspension can also be formed by re-dispersing dried silica into an aqueous and/or organic solvent. The concentration of hydrophilic precipitated silica in the aqueous and/or organic suspension is not critical and can. be within a range of about. 1 to 90 weight percent.  Preferably, the concentration, of hydrc-philic precipitated silica is. within a range of from 1 to 50 weight percent, and more preferably within a range of from 1 to 20 weight percent.<br>
The silane. Conversion Index is defined by the equation T2/ (TV * T2 + T3) .  The values for T1, T2 and T3 are determined by solid.state 29si NMR and represent reacted silane. units.  The Silane Conversion Index provides an indication of the degree of reaction or crosslinking of the silanes on adjacent Si atoms and with each other. The higher the index, number, the greater,the amount of crosslinking amongst the Silane, silica surface and adjacent silanes.  T1 represents a silane unit chemically bonded at one site to either the ailica surface or another silane.  T2 represents a silane unit chemically bonded at two sites to "either a Si atom on the Silica surface and to one adjacent silane, two adjacent<br>
. ■ i   -<br><br><br>
silanes or to two adjacent: surface Si atoms, i.e., partially crosslink-lug structures. T represents a silane unit chemically bonded at three sites to either a Si atom on Che silica surface and two adjacent silanes. two Si atoms and one silane or three silane units.<br>
It is believed that an organomettalic  Rooclant Conversion Index, comparable to .the Silane Conversion Index, can be developed and used by those skilled in the coupling agent art to provide an indication ox the degree of reaction or cross linking of zirconates and/or titanates {alone or in combination with si lanes) with the inorganic cxide and themselves.<br>
The Standard Tensile Stress ® 300% elongation is determined using a Standard Compounding Protocol.  The Standard Compounding Protocol described herein does not include the addition of free or unbounded coupling agents to the rubber batch  This is an important distinction since others have reported 300% Modulus values greater than 7.0. See U.S. Patent 5,705/137.  In this patent, Silane X 50-S, a silica/rubber coupling agent., was added during rubber compounding.  Typically, the addition .of.  such coupling agents to a. rubber batch requires mare time for mixing by the compounder.<br>
The polymeric compositions, e.g., plastics and/or resin, in which the modified filler can be added include essentially any plastic and/or resin. Included in this definition are rubber compounds,  Such polymers are described in Kirk othmer  Encyclopedia of chemical  Technology;   Fourth Edition, 1996, Volume 19, pp aa1-904, which description is herein incorporated by reference.  The modified filler may be admixed with the polymer or the polymerizable components thereof while the physical form of the polymer or<br><br>
polymerizable components is in any liquid or compoundable form such as a solution suspension, latex, dispersion, and the like.

For example, curable ruber could include combinations of SER and butadiene, rubber (BR) , SBR, BR. and natural rubber and any other combination of materials previously described as organic rubber.  In the description of this invention, the terms "rubber", "elastomer and rubbery elastomer" may be used interchangeably, unless indicated otherwise.  The   "rubber composition",<br><br><br>
"compounded rubber" and "rubber compound" are used interchangeably to refer to rubber which has been blended or<br>
mixed with various ingredients and materials and such terms are well known to those having skill in the rubber mixing or rubber .compounding- art,<br>
The modified filler of the present invention may be prepared by using step A alone or both steps A and B for preparing hydrophobic silica and fumed silica disclosed in U.S. patent 5,908,660 and 5,519,2.98, respectively, which disclosures are incorporated herein by reference, with the<br>

After a, further minute, the sample from Part A was added.  After another minute, the ram was raised and the chute swept.  The contents in the mixer were mixed for. an additional minute to achieve ,a. maximum temperature in the range, of from 14 5 to 150°C. (293-to 302°F.) and to complete the first pass in" the mixer. Depending upon the type of sample, the. rotor speed of the mixer may be increased or decreased after 4 minutes to achieve a temperature in the foregoing range within, the. specified mixing period.<br>
•	After completing the first pass, the temperature of<br>
the material was determined with a thermocouple to verify that in did not exceed the maximum temperature of 150oC.  The removed material was weighed and sheeted in a Farrel" 12 inch two-roll rubber mill, at 2.032 mm +0,127- mm (0.080 inch + 0.00S inch).  The resulting milled stock, was cut into strips in  preparation for  the second  pass in the mixer,<br>
A minimum of one hour wa.s allotted between the completion of the first pass in the mixer and the beginning of the second pass to allow the milled stock to cool.  If necessary, the aforedescribed cleaning and warming-up procedure using cv-60 grade natural rubber was completed prior to initiating the second pass.  The temperature of the mixer was adjusted to approximately 49oC.(120oF.) ,  With the cooling water running, the second pass was initiated by adding the strips of first pass stock to the mixer operating at ", ,  <br><br><br>
and the preweighed combination of Santoflex® 13 antiozonant and Okerin® 7.240 microcryscalline wax/paraffin wax blend.  After 0.5 minutes, the second addition of the combination of RM Sulfur, TBBS and DfG was added.  Alter a further l.S minutes,, the ram was raised and the chute swept.  The second pass was completed by mixing the stock an additional 2.0 minutes while maintaining the temperature at or below 1250C. (2576F.).".<br>
Part _C A Farrel 12 inch two-roll rubber mill was heated to approximately 60°C. (140°F-),  The stock from the second pass<br>
 of Part B was fed into the"running mill with a nip setting of 2.032 mm ±  0.127 mm (0.080 inch + 0.005 inch)  The resulting<br>
 sheet was placed on a flat surface until the temperature of the sheet reached room temperature.  Typically the sheet<br>
 cooled within about 30 minutes. Afterwards, the milled sheet<br>
was fed inco the rubber mill with a. nip setting of 3.81 mm +<br>
0.51 torn (0.l5.inch ± 0.02 inch) . The rolling bank was<br>
adjusted, if necessary, to maintain a uniform thickness.  The<br>
resulting material was  subjected to 16" side cuts and then. 6<br>
end passes. The rubber mill nip was adjusted to produce a<br>
sheet thickness of 2.032 mm + 0.12*7 rum (O.080 inch + 0.005<br>
inch) .  The sheet stock collected off the mill was placed on a<br>
flat clean surface.  Using a stencil, a rectangular sample<br>
203.2-mm X.152.4 mm (8 inches x 6 inches) was cut from the<br>
sheet stock.. The sample was conditioned,- i,e., ,stored between<br>
clean"polyethylene sheets and maintained for 15 to 18 hours .at<br>
a temperature of 23o + 2°  C, and a relative humidity of, 50% ±<br>
5%	.<br>
after conditioning, the sample was placed in a 203.2 nm.x 152.4 mm x 2.296 mm (3 inch x 6  inch x 0.09 inch) standard frame machine steel compression mold having a<br><br><br><br>
polished surface.  Tha sample was cured in a 6.1 centimeter x 61 centimeter. (24 inch x. 2.4 inch) K90 kilonewton (100 ton) 4-post electrically heated compression press, for T90, i.e., the time it takes for 90 percent of the cure to occur, in accordance with ASTM D-2084, plus 5 minutes at i50°C.
Part_D<br>
.	Testing was performed in .accordance with ASTM .D<br>
412-93a - Test Method A.  Dumbbell test, specimens were prepared using Die C,  An instron model 4204 with an automated contact extensicmeter for measuring elongation was used.  The cross-head speed was found to-equal 508 mm/min.  All calculations were done using the Series IX Automated Materials Testing software supplied by the manufacturer.  The Tensile Stress at 300% elongation (in MPa) for samples prepared using the Standard Compounding Protocol was reported as the Standard Tensile Stress at 300%. elongation (STS © 300%) in Table 3.-.<br>
A precipitated silica was produced by acidifying a sodium silicate solution with sulfuric acid.  The majority of the precipitate was formed at a pK above 8.5.  Further precipitate was produced by continuing the acid addition until the" solution pK reached a level of about 3.5.<br>
A sample of. the precipitated silica for surface area analysis, as described in Example 5, was prepared t,<br><br>
filtering and washing a portion of the silica until the rinse water demonstrated a conductivity level of from about 300 to 900 miczomhos.  The resulting filter cake, was reliquefied using a high shear agitator  to form a solid in liquid suspension, The suspension was dried in a Niro spray drier (inlet temperature about 360oC and the outlet temperature about 1.10°C) .  Listed in Table x are the surface areas of the precipitated silicas used to prepare the modified silica of the Examples and comparative Examples.<br>
Approximately 40 kilograms (kg) of a precipitated silica suspension of which about 5,2  kg is silica and about 11.7 kg of isopropy1 alcohol were added to a 30 gallon glass lined vessel having a bottom drain.  The vessel was also equipped with a temperature recorder, mechanical stirrer, means for heating and a condenser.<br>
while the contents of the vessel were stirred and heating initiated, Si-69 reinforcing agent, referred to herein as TESfT, was addod over an interval of time (typically, about 10.minutes) that would yield the approximate amounts listed for weight percent of TESPT per silica on a drybasis tor the examples listed in-Table 3. After completion of the TESPT addition, dimethyldichlorosilane (DMPCS) was added in an identical maimer to yield the approximate amounts listed for weight percent of. DMDCS per silica on a dry basis in Table. 3. The weight ratios of TESPT /DMDCS is also listed in Table 3. The resulting pH of the solutions was about O.B.<br>
After completion of the DMDCS addition, the mixture was heated to about 68°C and held at this temperature for about 10 minutes.  While cooling, enough toluene (typically 15 kg) adaded to the stirred mixture to effect separation of<br>
i<br><br>
the hydrophobic precipitated silica from the aqueous phase without forming an. emulsion. The aguecus phase was drained from the vessel.  This stirred mixture in the vessel containing the hydrophobic precipitated silica was then washed twice with about 20 kg for Example 1 . and about: 40 kg for Example 2 of water containing about 400 grams for Example I and 500 grams for Example 2  of sodium bicarbonate.  The aqueous phase was drained.<br>
After washing was completed, enough additional toluene (about 1.3.9 kg for Example 1 and 23.7 kg for Example 2) was added to the stirred mixture to make a flowable solid-in-liquid suspension that could be. easily discharged from the vessel. The resulting suspension was dried in a rotocone drier under vacuum (minimum 23 inches of mercury) at a minimum of 140eC.  Drying was continued until the samples showed a wt.% loss of less than 4.5 % when exposed to 150°C for 3.0 minutes.<br>
                               EXAMPLE 3-8 <br>
Approximately 19 kg of a precipitated silica suspension of which about 1.5 kg is silica was added to a 40 liter glass vessel having a bottom drain.  The vessel was also equipped with a temperature recorder, mechanical stirrer, means for heating and a condenser.<br>
While the contents, of the vessel were stirred, about 1 weight percent per silica on a dry basis of the surfactant listed in Table 2 was added. After completion of the surfactant addition, the resulting mixture was stirred for 5 minutes.  TESPT was added over a S minute interval to the stirred mixture to yield about 10 weight percent of TESPT per silica on a dry basis.  The resulting pH of the solution was about 3.0,  After completion of the TESPT addition,<br><br><br>
dimethyldichloresiiane (DMDCS) was added in an identical, manner to yield about 13 weight percent of DMDCS per silica on a dry basis.. The resulting pH of the solution ranged from about 0.9 to 1.6.  The mixture was heated to from about 61 to 680C and held at this temperature for typically about 20 minutes.  The suspensions of Example 3 and B were heated for about 40 and about 16 minutes, respectively. While cooling, enough 50 wt,% NaOH was added to the mixture over an interval oil time (typically 10-15. minutes) to adjust the pH Co about 7.0.  20 L of the stirred mixture containing the hydrophobic precipitated silica was discharged iron the vessel, vacuum filtered, using a Buchner funnel and then washed three times with about 6 kg of water each wash.  After washing was completed, enough deionized water and high shear agitation was applied to the filter, cake to make a flowable solid in liquid suspension. The resulting suspension was spray dried in a. Niro spray drier (inlet temperature about 400°C and the outlet temperature about 150°C) to form the treated silica samples of Examples 3-B.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1-3 17 L of the untreated precipitated silica used in Examples 1-2 containing 820 grans of silica was added to a vessel equipped with a mechanical stirrer.  The pH of the slurry before treatment was about 6.5. While the stirrer was  mixing the suspension, enough TE"SPT was added to yield the approximate amount listed for weight percent" of TESPT per silica on a dry weight basis for. Comparative Examples"1-3 listed in Table 3.  The resulting treated suspensions wera dried in a Niro spray drier (inlet temperature about 360°C and the outlet temperature about 110°C).<br><br>
The surface area of the treated and untreated test silica samples ot Examples 1-8 and Comparative Examples (CE) 3 was determined using a Horiba 6 200 series* instrument by a dynamic single point surface area technique, ASTM D3037-93, Procedure C (modified) , This procedure simulates the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method at p/P = 0,334,using 30% nitrogen-in-helium as the adsorbate gas. The ASTM procedure was modified as follows: a 30% nitrogen-in-helium gas mixture was used; a flow of approximately 40 mL/min was maintained.; samples were dried in the analysis cells under a flow of nitrogen at 18O+5+OC tar  one hour; and the adsorbed nitrogen on the sample was desorbed by removing the dewar of liquid nitrogen and allowing the sample to warm to room temperature with no external heat source.  Results for the untreated test silica samples are listed in Table 1 and for the treated test silica samples are listed in Table 4. <br>
The percent carbon was determined by CHN analysis using a Carlo Erba model 1106 elemental analyser,  A 1 - 2 mq sample in a scaled tin capsule was burned in an oxygen enriched atmosphene at 104 0 °C with a Helium carrier, quantitatively combusted over Cr2o3, then the combustion gases were passed over Cu at 6S0 "C, to eliminate the excess oxygen and reduce, the oxides of nitrogen to nitrogen. The gases were then passed through a chromatographic column, separated and eluted as Na, C02; and H;0, The eluted gases .were measured by a thermal conductivity detector.  The instrument was calibrated by combustion of standard compounds.  Results are listed in Table 4.<br>
The percent sulfur was determined by x-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XKF) , using a Rigaku.RIx 2000" wavel dispersive spectrometer.  Samples were briquetted<br><br>
into aluminum support cups at 344.75 megapascals (25 cons/in* )<br>
pressure after mixing with SpeccroBland® binder (Chemplex<br>
Industries/Tuckahoe; NY) in a 1:1 weight ratio.  NIST- and<br>
WES- "traceable secondary standards (PPG production silicas, or<br>
equivalent) wars used for the empirical XRF calibration,<br>
Detection was via a, gas proportional flow counter using a<br>
germanium crystal monochromator  Results are listed in<br>
Table 4,<br>
The Silane Conversion Index reported as SCI in<br>
Table 4 was determined by solid state 29si NMR. This data was<br>
collected at ambient temperature on a Bruker AM-300 NMR with a<br>
narrow bore magnet and a Doty 7 mm standard speed MAS probe.<br>
Samples were packed into 7 nun o,d. .zirconia rotors and Healed <br>
Angle with a speed of about 5.0 kHz. . Cross Polarization<br>
(CP/MAS) data was collected using a 90" 1H pulse, SHOO - 8400<br>
scans per spectrum, a-5 msecond contact time, high power<br>
proton decoupling during data acquisition, and a 3 second<br>
relaxation delay.  Hartmann-Hahn conditions were achieved<br>
using a kaolinite sample (J. Rocha and J. Klinowski, J.  Magn,.<br>
Res on.,   90, 567 (1920)), All chemical shifts were referenced<br>
externally to tetramethylsilane dMS)   .       <br>
All spectra were analysed using a nonlinear curve<br>
fitting program (LINESIM). on an Aspect 3 000 computer to<br>
determine the relative area %  for the Tl (-49 ppm) , T5 (-57<br>
ppm), and T3 (-65 ppm) peaks. Area % values for T1 T3, and T3<br>
were determined by curve fitting over the region of -3 0 ppm<br>
to -80 ppm.	<br>
pH determinations were made on the treated silicas of the Examples, and Comparative Examples by the following procedure; add 5.0 g of silica (in powder form) to a 150 mL beaker containing  stir bar add 50 mL of<br><br><br>
isppropanol and 50 mL of colonized water; and stir vigorously without splashing until the silica is suspended.  Place a calibrated pH electrode in the vigorously stirring solution and record the pH reading after one minute (+ S sac),  The results are listed in Table 4.<br>
The Soxhlet Extractable percent carbon of the treated silica of Example I was determined by adding 5.44 grams of the material to a 43  mm x 3.33 mm {internal diameter x external length) cellulose extraction thimble which was placed into an appropriately sized Soxhlet extraction tube which was fitted with a condenser.  This Soxhlet extractor and Condenser system was attached to a round bottom flask containing 700 mL of toluene.  The Hash heated, to the reflux temperature of the toluene. After refluxing for 25 hours, the used toluene was replaced with unused toluene and refluxing was continued for 22.5 hours.  The resulting extracted, treated silica was recovered and dried until a sample showed a 1.0 weight percent less when exposed to 160°C for 10 minutes.  The percent, carbon of the extracted sample was determined using the procedure described herein.  The Soxhlet extractable percent carbon was determined using the. following equation;<br>
(% carbon before extraction )-(% carbon after extraction) x 100 (% carbon before extraction) .<br>
The percent carbon before extraction was 3.50 and the percent carbon after extraction was 3.02 . Therefore, the Soxhlet" Extrractable percent, carbon of the treated silica of Example 1 was 13.7.  .<br><br><br><br>
