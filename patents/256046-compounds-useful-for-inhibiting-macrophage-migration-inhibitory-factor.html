This application.claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 60/556,440, filed March 26,2004, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION FieM of the laveatio»<br>
The present invention relates to isoxazoline and related compounds, to<br>
intermedtates and meflmds for their prqpMratinn in cnmpnsiiining rraf|tqipjţ) andtotheiruse.<br>
Macropbage migration inhibitory factor (MEF) is one of the earliest described cytokines, and is an immunoregulatory protein with a wide variety of cellular and biologica! activities (forreviews see: Swope. et al.. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 139,1-32 (1999); Metz. et al.. Adv. Immunol. 66,197-223 (1997); and Bucala. FASEB J. 14,1607-1613 (1996)). Originally, MIF was found to be secreted by activated h/mphoid cells, to inhibit the random migration of macrophages, and to be associated with delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions (Georee. et al.. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med., 111, 514-521 (1962); Weiser.etal.. J. Immunol. 126,1958-1962 (198n: Bloom. et al.. Science, 153:80-82 (1966); Pavid. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 56, 72-77 (1966). MIF was also shown to<br><br>
enhance macrophage adherence, phagocytosis and tumoricidal activity fNatbanetai.. J. Exp. Med., 137,275-288 (1973); Nafran, J. Exp. Med., 133,1356-1376 (1971); Churchill. et al. J. Immunol, 115,781-785 (1975)). The availability of recombinant MOP nas allowed for confinnation of these biologica! activities, and for the identification of additional activities.<br>
Recombinant human MIF was originally cloned firom a human T cell library (Weiser. et al.. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 86,7522-7526 (1989)), and was shown to activate blood-derived macrophages to kill intracellular parasites and tumor cells in vitro, to stimulate ÎL-1P and TNFa expression, and to induce nitric oxide synthcsis (Weiser. et al.. J. ImmunoL, 147,2006-2011 (1991); PozzL et al.. Cellular Immunol., 145,372-379 (1992); Weiser. et al.. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA, 89,8049-8052 (1992); ftmff»-** J- Immunol, 150,1908-1912 (1993)). Whtle the conchBÎons ayailabfe from severa! of these earty reports are confounded by the presence of a btoactive ontogenie contaminant in tite recombinant MIF preparatioro used, the potent pro-infiammatory activities of MIF have been established in other studies mat do not suffer firom this complicating factor (reviewed in Bucala. The FASEB, Journal 10,1607-1613 (1996)).<br>
More recent MIF studies have capitalized on the production of recombinant MIF in purified form as well as the development of MIF-specifîc polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to establish the biological  role of MIF in a variety of normal homeostatic and pathophysiological settings (reviewed in Rice. et al.. Annual Reports in Medicinal Chemistry, 33,243-252 (1998)). Among the most important insights of these later reports has been the recognition that MIF not only is a cytokine product of the immune system, but also is a hormone-like product of the<br>
 endocrine system, particularly the pitiritary gland. This work has underscored the potent activity of MBP as a counter-regulator of the anti-inflammatory effects of the glucocorticoids (both those endogenousfy released and those therapeutically administered), with the effect mat the normal activities of glucocorticoids to limit and suppress the severity of inflammatory responses are inhibited by MIF. The endogenous MIF response is thus seen as a căuşe or an exacerbative factor in a variety of inflammatory diseases and conditions (reviewed in Donnelly. et al.. Molecular Medicine Today, 3, pp.502-507 (1997)).<br>
MDF is now known to nave severa! biological functions beyond its well-known association with delayed-type hypersensitiviry reactions. For example, as mentioned above, MB? released by macrophages and T cells acts as a prhritary mediator in response to physiological coacentrations of glucocorticoids (Bucj|g, FASEB J., 14,1607-1613 (1996». This Jeads to an overridmg effect of glucocord'coid im»»Mno-«in»ea"vg •erivfty thrrmgh ahraţjong in TNF- o, ILIB, IL-6, and IL-8 levels. Addrtional biological activities of MDF include the regulation of stimulated T cells (pahCT.yţflţ, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 93,7849-7854 (1996)), the control of IgE synthesis (Mifrrn»WTet fll„ Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90,10056-10060 (1993)), the funcţional inactivation of the p53 tumor suppressor protein (Hudson. et al.. J. Exp. Med, 190,1375-1382 (1999)), the regulation of glucose and carbohydrate metabolism (Sakaue. et al.. Mol. Med., 5, 361-371 (1999)), and the attenuation of tumor cell growth and tumor angiogenesis (Chesnev. et al.. Mol. Med., 5,181-191 (1999); Şhhniqai, et şln Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 264, 751-758 (1999)).<br>
Interleukin-1 (DL-1) and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) are biological<br>
substances produced by a variety of cells, such as monocytes or macrophages. ÎL-1 has been demonstrated to mediate a variety of biological activities thought to be important in immunoregulation and other physiological conditions such as inflammation. The myriad of known biological activities of ÎL-1 include the activation of T helper cells, induction of fever, stimulation of prostaglandin or collagenase production, neutrophil chemotaxis, induction of acute phase proteins and the suppression of plasma iron levels.<br>
There are many disease states in which excessive or unregulated ÎL-1 production is implicated in exacerbating and/or causing the disease. These include rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, endotoxemia and/or toxic shock syndrome, other acute or chronic inflammatory disease states such as the inflammatory reaction induced by endotoxin or inflammatory bowel disease, tuberculosis, atherosclerosis, diabetes, muscle degeneration, cachexia, psoriatic arthritis, Reiter's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, traumatic arthritis, rubella arthritis, and acute synovitis.<br>
Excessive or unregulated TNF production has been implicated in mediating or exacerbating a number of diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, osteoarthritis, gouty arthritis and other arthritic conditions; sepsis, septic shock, endotoxic shock, gram negative sepsis, toxic shock syndrome, adult respiratory distress syndrome, cerebral malaria, chronic pulmonary inflammatory disease, silicosis, pulmonary sarcoidosis, bone resorption diseases, reperfusion injury, graft vs. host reaction, allograft rejections, fever and myalgias due to infection, such as influenza, cachexia secondary to infection or malignancy, cachexia secondary to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), AIDS, ARC<br>
(AIDS related complex), keloid informaticii, scar tissue formation, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or pyrosis.<br>
Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is a chemotactic factor produced by several cell types including mononuclear cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and keratinocytes. Its production from endothelial cells is induced by ÎL-1, TNF, or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). IL-8 stimulates a number of functions in vitro. It has been shown to have chemoattractant properties for neutrophils, T-lymphocytes, and basophils. In addition it induces histamine release from basophils from both normal and atopic individuala as well lysosomal enzyme release and respiratory burst from neutrophils. IL-8 has also been shown to increase the surface expression of Mac-1 (CD 11 b/CD 18) on neutrophils without de novo protein synthesis, this may contribuie to increased adhesion of the neutrophils to vascular endothelial cells. Many diseases are characterized by massive neutrophil infiltration. Conditions associated with an increase in IL-8 production (which is responsible for chemotaxis of neutrophils into the inflammatory site) would benefit by compounds which are suppressive of IL-8 production.<br>
ÎL-1 and TNF affect a wide variety of cells and tissues and these cytokines as well as other leukocyte derived cytokines are important and criticai inflammatory mediators of a wide variety of disease states and conditions. The inhibition of these cytokines is of benefit in controlling, reducing and alleviating many of these disease states.<br>
The three-dimensional crystal structure of human MIF reveals that the protein exists as a homotrimer (Lolis. et al.. Proc. Ass. Am. Phys., 108, 415-419 (1996) and is structurally related to 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase, 5-<br>
carboxymethyi-2-hydroxymuconate, chorismate mutase, and to D-dopachrome tautomerase (Swope. et al.. EMBO J., 17, 3534-3541 (1998); Sumoto, et al.. Biochemistry, 38, 3268-3279 (1999). Recently, the crystal structurc has been reported for the complex formed between human MIF and p-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid flLubetskv. et al.. Biochemistry, 38, 7346-7354 (1999). It was found that the substrate binds to a hydrophobic cavtty at the amino terminus and interacts with Pro- 1, Lys-32, and De-64 in one of the subunits, and with Tyr-95 and Asn-97 in an adjacent subunit Similar interactions between murine MIF and (E)-2-fluoro-p-hydroxycinnamate have been reported (Taylor. et al.. Biochemistry, 38, 7444-7452 (1999)). Solution studies using NMR provide further evidence of the interaction between p-hydroxyphenylpyiuvic acid «nd Pro- 1 in the amino-terminal hydrophobic cavity (Swope. etaL EMBO J., 17, 3534-3541 (1998)).<br>
Mutation studies provide convincing evidence that Pro- 1 îs invorved in the catarytic function of MIF. Defetion of Pro- 1 or replacement of Pro- 1 with Ser<br>
yţ ft|„ Biochemistry, 36,15356-15362 (1997)), Gry (Swope. et al.. EMBO<br>
J., 17, 3534-3541 (1998)), or Phe MermffnnwsKJ-Vpsatka. gţ  Biochemistry, 38, 12841-12849 (1999)), and additkm of an N-terminal peptide tag to Pro-1 (Bendrat et al.. Biochemistry, 36, 15356-15362 (1997)) abrogated the catalytic activity of MIF in assays using L-dopachrome methyl ester and p-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid. A similar loss in acnvity was found by inserting Ala between Pro-1 and Met-2 (Lubetskv et al.. Biochemistry, 38,7346-7354 (1999). The Pro to Ser MIF mutant showed glucocorticoid counter-regulatory activity (Bendrat et al.. Biochemistry, 36,15356-15362 (1997)) and was fully capable, as was the Pro to Phe mutant, of inhibiting monocyte cbemotaxis (Hermanowski-Vosatka et aln<br>
Biochemistry, 38, 12841-12849 (1999). in contrast, Ihe Pro to Gly MIF mutant was greatly impaired in its abilhy to stimulate superoxide generation in acti vated neutrophils (Swopeetal.. EMBO J., 17, 3534-3541 (1998).<br>
MIF bas been characterized as an anterior pituitary-derived hormone that potentiates lethal endotoxemia (Bucala. Immunol. Lett., 1994, 43, 23-26; Bucala. Circ. Shock, 1994, 44, 35-39), a factor which can override glucocorticoid-mediated suppression of inflammatory and immune responses (Calandra and Bucala. Crit. Rev. Immunol., 1997, 17, 77-88; Calandra and Bucala. J. Inflamm., 1995, 47, 39-51), and as an activator of T-cells after mitogenic or antigenic stimuli (Bacher et ai, Proc. Natt. Acad. Sci. U. S. A 19%, 93, 7849-7854).<br>
This cytokine bas been shown to have multiple roles whhin mc confines of regulating the immune rcsponse as wefl as betng associated with cdl growth and dJffercntMrtkTnduringwouDdîepakaDdca»cmogenesis. Expression bas been shown to be devrted in prostate «denocarcinomas (Arcuri et al.. Prostate, 1 999, 39, 159-165; Mever-Sieyler yrf ffmfrm Urotogy, 1996, 48, 448-452), colon carcinomas of the mouse (TftkftlNIlfî  ti  Mn1 Med., 1998, 4, 707-714), lipopolysacharide-induced HL60 cells (a leukemia cell li<br>
Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int, 1996, 40, 861-869), and upon treatment with ultraviolet radiation (fflimiTf»',, J. Invest Dermatol., 1999, 1 12, 210-215). The pharmacological modulation of MIF activity and/or expression may therefore be an appropriate point of therapeutic intervention in pathological conditions.<br>
The protein has been detected in the synovia of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (Onodera et al.. Cytokine, 1999, 11, 163-167) and its expression at sites of inflammation and from macrophages suggests a role for the mediator in regulating<br>
the function of macrophages in host defense (Calandra et al.. J. Exp. Med., 1994, 179,1895-1902). Activity of MIF has also been found to correlate well with delayed hypersensitivity and cellular immunity in humans flBernhagenetal.. J. Exp. Med., 1996, 183,277-282; David. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., 1966, 56, 72-77). The protein has also been implicated in neural function and development in rodents rfiacher et al.. Mol. Med., 1998,4,217-230; Matsunaga et al.. J. Biol. Chem., 1999,274, 3268-3271 :Nishioet al.. Biochim. Biophys. Acta., 1999,1453, 74-82;<br>
i<br>
Suzuki et al.. BrainRes., 1999, 816,457-462).<br>
There is a need in the art to discover and develop small organic molecules that function as MBF inhibitors (e.g., antagonists) and further possess the benefits of small organic molecule therapeutics versus larger, polymeric protein (e.g., antibody) and nucleic acid-based (e.g., anti-sense) therapeutic agents. The therapeutic potenţial of low molecular weight MIF inhibitors is substanţial, given the activities of anti-MIF antibodies in models of endotoxin- and exotoxin-induced toxic shock (Bernhagen et al.. Nature, 365,756-759 (1993); Kobavashi et al.. Hepatology, 29,1752-1759 (1999); Calandra et al.. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA., 95, 11383-11388 (1998); and Makita et al.. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 158, 573-579 (1998), T-cell activation rBacher et al.. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA., 93, 7849-7854 (1996), autoimmune diseases (e.g., graft versus host disease, insulin-dependent diabetes, and various forms of lupus) including rheumatoid arthritis (Kitaichi. et al.. Curr. Eye Res., 20,109-114 (2000); Leech. et al.. Arthritis Rheum., 42, 1601-1608 (1999), wound healing (Abe. et al.. Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 1500,1-9 (2000), and angiogenesis (Shimizum. et al. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 264, 751-758 (1999). Low molecular weight anti-MIF drugs<br>
exhibiting such activities may offer clinical advantages over neutralizing antibodies and nucleic acid-based agents because they may be orally active or generally more easily administered, nave better bioavailabilities, nave improved biodistributions, and are normally much less expensive to produce.

The present invention also relates to the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of general Formula I or n.<br>
The compounds of the Formula I or n which are basic in nature are capable , of forming a wide variety of different salts with various inorganic and organic acids, Aithough such salts must be pharmaceutically acceptable for administration to animals, it is oflen desirable in practice to initially isolate a compound of the Formula I or H from the reaction mixture as a pharmaceutically unacceptable salt and then simply convert the latter back to the free base compound by treatment with an alkaline reagent, and subsequently convert the free base to a<br>
phannaceutically acceptabJe acid addition salt The acid addition saits of tbe base compounds of this invention ara readily prepared by treating the base compound with a substantially equivalent amount of tbe chosen mineral or organic acid in an aqueous solvent medium or in a siritable organic solvent such as methanol or ethanol. Upon caretul evaporation of the solvent» tfae desired solid salt is obtained. The acids which are used to prepare the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of Ihe aforementioned base compounds of this invention include those which form non-toxic acid addition salts, i.e., sahs containing phannacologically acceptable anions, such as the chloride, bromide, iodide, nitrate, sulfate, bisulfate, phosphate, acid phosphate, acetate, lactate, cifrate, acid cifrate, tartrate, bitartrate, succinate, maleate, fumarate, glutamatc, L-lactate, L-tarfraie, tosylate, mesylate, gtuconate, saccharate, benzoate, methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p-tohienesuUbnate and pamoate (i-e-» l,rHnethylene-bis-(2-hydroxy-3-naphthoate)&gt;aUts.<br>
The invention also relates to base addition sahs of the compound. The chemical bases that may be used as reagents to prepare pharmaceutically acceptable base salts of those compounds of general Formula I or n that are acidic in nature are those that form non-toxic base salts with such compounds. Those compounds of the Formula I or n which are also acidic in nature, e.g., where substituent R, R1, R2, or R3 includes a -COOH or tetrazole moiety, are capable of forming base salts with various phannacologically acceptable cations. Examples of such salts include the alkali metal or alkaline-earth metal salts and particularly, the sodium and potassium salts. These sahs are all prepared by convenţional techniques. The chemical bases which are used as reagents to prepare the pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable base sahs of this invention include those which fonn non-toxic base safts wrth the herein described acîdic compounds of Formula I or O. These salts caneasilybepreparedbytreatiiigtherorres<br>
aqueous solution containing the desired pharmacologically acceptable cations, and then evaporating the resuWng solution to dryness, preferably under reduced pressure. Altematively, they may also be prepared by mixing lower alkanolic solutions of the acidic compounds and the desired alkali metal alkoxide together, and then evaporating the resulting solution to dryness in the same manner as before. hi either case, stoichiometric quantities of reagents are preferably employed in order to ensure completeness of reaction and ţnffinţtmffi» product yieids. Such non-toxic base săra include» but ne not limited to those derived from such pharmacologicaUy acceptable cations snch as alkah' metal cations (e.g., potassium and sodium) and «IMine evm metal cations (e.g., calcium and magnesium), ammonium or water-sohiWe amine addition sahs such as N-<br>
iiţpEX and the 10W6T *nV«t&gt;olaTrţyrţniniiim and Other base<br>
sahs of pharmaceutically acceptable organic amines.<br>
The compounds and prodrugs of the present invention can exist in several tautomeric fonns, and geometric isomers and mixtures thereof. AII such tautomeric forms are included whhin the scope of the present invention. Tautomers exist as mixtures of tautomers in solution. hi solid fonn, usually one tautomer predominates. Even though one tautomer may be described, the present invention includes all tautomers of the present compounds.<br>
The present invention also includes atropisomers of the present invention. Atropisomers refer to compounds of the invention that can be separated into<br>
rotationally restricted isomers. The compounds of this invention may contain olefin-like double bonds. When such bonds are present, the compounds of the invention exist as cis and trans configurations and as mixtures thereof.<br>
The present invention also includes isotopically-labeled compounds, which are identical to those recited in general Formulas I or H, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine and chlorine, such as 2H, 3H, I3C, 14C, 15N, 18O, I70,31P, 32P, 35S, I8F, and 36C1, respectively. Compounds of the present invention, prodrugs thereof, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts ofsaid compounds or ofsaid prodrugs which contain the aforementioned isotopes and/or other isotopes of other atoms are within the scope of this invention. Certain isotopically-labeled compounds of the present invention, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as 3H and 14C are incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated, i.e., 3H, and carbon-14, i.e., 14C, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., 2H, can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and, hence, may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically labeled compounds of Formula I or II of this invention and prodrugs thereof can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed herein, e.g., in the Examples, by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled<br>
reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent.<br>
A "suitable substituent" is intended to mean a chemically and phannaceutically acceptable funcţional group i.e., a moiety that does not negate the inhibitory activity of the inventive compounds. Such suitable substituents may be routinely selected by those skilled in the art. Illustrative examples of suitable substituents include, but are not limited to halo groups, perfluoroalkyl groups, perfluoroalkoxy groups, alkyl groups, cycloalkyl groups, alkenyl groups, alkynyl groups, hydroxy groups, oxo groups, mercapto groups, alkylthio groups, alkoxy groups, aryl or heteroaryl groups, aryloxy or heteroaryloxy groups, aralkyl or heteroaralkyl groups, aralkoxy or heteroaralkoxy groups, HO—(C ==O)— groups, amino groups, alkyl- and dialkylamino groups, carbamoyl groups, alkylcarbonyl groups, alkoxycarbonyl groups, alkylaminocarbonyl groups dialkylamino carbonyl groups, arylcarbonyl groups, aryloxycarbonyl groups, alkylsulfonyl groups, arylsulfonyl groups and the like.<br>

Suchbenefitsmay, insomecases, bemost evident by a reduced need for steroid therapy (e.g., lower dose amount or frequency; less potent agent; reduced need for systemic administration) or by reduced side-effects associated with steroid administration. The benefits of administering a MIF inhibitor (and specifically a compound of Formula I or H) may be realized as a monotherapy, using only the MIF inhibitor of Ihe present invention, or as a combination therapy with additional anti-inflammatory agents, including especially, but without limitation, an anti-inflammatory steroid. Such combination therapy may be achieved through administration of a single formulation or pharmaceutical composition mat combines the MIF inhibitor (particularly an inhibitor of Formula I or n) with at least one other anti-inflammatory agent (which<br>
may be a steroidal or a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent), or through administration of separate formulanons or pharmaceutical compositions in conjunction with each other, or both.<br>
Compounds of Formulas I and n are also capable of inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines affected by MBF, such as IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IFN-y and TNF, andarethereforeofuseintberapy.  IL-1, IL-2, DL-6, IL-8, IFN-y and TNF affect a wide variety of cells and tissues and these cytokines, as well as other leukocyte-derived cytokines, are important and criticai inflammatory mediators of a wide variety of disease states and conditions. The inhibition of these cytokines is of benefit in controUing, reducing and alleviating many of these disease states.<br>
Accordingry, the prestat mvention provides a method of tresting a cytokine mediated disease whtch comprises administering an eflectrve cytokipe-interfering amount of a compound of Formula I or n or a phannaceuticalry acceptable şah thereof.<br>
In particular, compounds of Formulas I or n or a phannaceutically acceptable salt thereof are of use in the therapy of any disease state in a human, or other mammal, which is exacerbated by or caused by excessive or unregulated MDF, IL-1, IL-2, DL-6, IL-8, IFN-y and TNF production by such mammal's cells, such as, but not limited to, monocytes and/or macrophages.<br>
Accordingly, in another aspect, tbis invention relates to a method of inhibiting the production of IL-1 in a mammal in need thereof which comprises administering to said mamţrmţ an effective amount of a compound of Formula I or n a phannaceutically acceptable şah thereof. There are many disease states in which excessive or unregulated IL-1 production is implicated in exacerbating<br>
and/or causing the disease. These include rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, meningitis, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, neurotrauma/closed head injury, stroke, endotoxemia and/or toxic shock syndrome, other acute or chronic inflammatory disease states such as the inflammatory reaction induced by endotoxin or inflammatory bowel disease, tuberculosis, atherosclerosis, muscle degeneration, multiple sclerosis, cachexia, bone resorption, psoriatic arthritis, Reiter's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, traumatic arthritis, rubella arthritis and acute synovitis. Recent evidence also links IL-1 activity to diabetes, pancreatic cells disease, and Alzheimer's disease.<br>
In a further aspect, tins inventkm relates to a method of inhibiting the productkm of TNF in a marnmal in need thereof whkh comprises administering to said nMir)fiiTna| an effectivc amount of a compound of Formula I or n or a phannaceuticallyacceptaDk şah thereof. Excessrve or unregulated TNF production has been ţmf'fa'irf'** inmediating or exacerbating a number of diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, osteoarthritis, gouty arthritis and other arthritic conditions, sepsis, septic shock, endotoxic shock, gram negative sepsis, toxic shock syndrome, adult respiratory distress syndrome, stroke, cerebral malaria, chronic obstructive puhnonary disease, chronic pulmonary inflammatory disease, silicosis, puhnonary sarcoidosis, bone resorption diseases, such as osteoporosis, cardiac, brain and renal repertusion injury, graft vs. host reaction, allograft rejections, fever and myalgias due to infection, such as influenza (including HIV-induced forms), cerebral malaria, meningitis, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, cachexia secondary to infection or malignancy, cachexia secondary to acquked immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), AIDS, ARC (AIDS<br>
l   related complex), keloid formation, scar tissue formation, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and pyresis.<br>
Compounds of Formula I or n are also useful in the treatment of viral infections, where such viruses are sensitive to upregulation by TNF or will elicit TNF production in vivo. The viruses contemplated for treatment herein are those that produce TNF as a result of infection, or those which are sensitive to inhibition, such as by decreased replication, directly or indirectly, by the TNF inhibiting-compounds of Formula I or n. Such viruses include, but are not limited to HTV-1 , HTV-2 and HTV-3, Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Influenza, adenovirus and the Herpes group of viruses, such as but not limited to, Herpes Zoster and Herpes Simplex. Accordmgry, in a further aspect, thts invention relates to a method of treating a<br>

administering to such maxnmal an effcctrve TNF mtiMting amount of a compound of Formuk I or H or a pharmaceutkally acceptable şah mereof<br>
Compounds of Formula I or n may also be used in association with the veterinary treatment of mammals, other mân in humans, in need of inhibition of TNF production. TNF mediated diseases for treatment, in animals include disease states such as those noted above, but in particular viral infections. Examples of such viruses include, but are not limited to, lentivirus infections such as, equine infectious anaemia virus, caprine arthritis virus, visna virus, or maedi virus or retrovirus infections, such as but not limited to feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), bovine immunodeficiency virus, or canine immunodeficiency virus or other retroviral infections.<br>
The compounds of Formula I or n may also be used topically in the<br>
treatment of topica! disease states mediated by or exacerbated by excessive cytokine production, such as by IL-I or TNF respectively, such as infiamed joints, eczema, contact dermatnis psoriasis and other infiammatory skin conditions such as sunburn; infiammatory eye conditions including conjunctivitis; pyresis, pain and other conditions associated with inflammation. Periodontal disease bas also been implemented in cytokine production, both topically and systemically. Hence, the use of compounds of Formula I or n to control the inflammation associated with cytokine production in such perorai diseases such as gingivitis and periodontitis is another aspect of the present invention.<br>
Compounds of Formula I or n have also been shown to inhibit the production of IL(herleukm-«, NAP). Accordingfy, m a further aspect, this invention relates to a method of mhibitmg the productktt of IL-8 in a mammal in need thereof which compriscs ""'""«ffrii1 to said manunal an effective amount of a compound of Formula I or D or aphannaceuticaUy acceptable şah thereof.<br>
There are many disease states in which excessive or unregulated IL-8 production is implicated in exacerbating and/or causing the disease. These diseases are characterized by massive nevrtropbil infiltration such as, psoriasis, infiammatory bowel disease, asthma, cardiac and renal reperfusion injury, adult respiratory distress syndrome, thrombosis and glomerulonephritis. Aii ofthese diseases are associated with increased IL-8 production which is responsible for the chemotaxis of neutrophils into the infiammatory site. In contrast to other inflammatory cytokines (BL-1, TNF, and IL-6), IL-8 has the unique property of promoting neutrophil chemotaxis and activation. Therefore, the inhibition of IL-8 production would lead to a direct reduction hi the neutrophil infiltration.<br>
The compounds of Formula I or II are administered in an amount sufficient to inhibit a cytokine, m particular MIF, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, DL-8, IPN-y and TNF, production such that h is regulated down to normal levels, or in some case to subnormal levels, so as to ameliorate or prevent Ine disease state. Abnorma! levels of MIF, IL-1, IL-2, EL-6, BL-8, IFN-y and TNF, for instance in the context of the present invention, constitute: (i) levels of free (not cell bound) MIF, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IFN-Y and TNF greater mân or equal to l picogram per ml; (ii) any cell associated MIF, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IFN-Y and TNF; or (iii) the presence of MIF, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IFN-y and TNF mRNA above basal levels in cells or tissues in which MIF, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IFN-y and TNF, rcspcctively, is produced.<br>

As used herein, tbe term "MIF mediated disease or disease state" refers to any and all disease states in wbich MIF plays a role, either by production or biological or enzymatic (tautomerase and/or oxidoreductase) activity of MIF itself, or by MIF causing or modnlating another cytokine to be released, such as but not limited to IL-1 ,IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IFN-y and TNF. A disease state m which, for instance, BL-1 is a major component, and whose production or action, is exacerbated or secreted in response to MIF, would therefbre be considereda disease state mediated by MIF.<br>
As used herein, the term "cytokme" refers to any secreted porypeptide mat affectethefuncţtaroofceibandisamoleciite<br>
includes, but is not limited to, monokines and lymphokines, regardless of which cells produce them. For instance, a monokine is referred to as being produced and secreted by a mononuclear cell, such as a macrophage and/or monocyte. Many other cells however also produce monokines, such as natural killer cells, fibroblasts, basophils, neutrophils, endothelial cells, brain astrocytes, bone marrow stromal cells, epideral keratinocytes and B-lymphocytes. Lymphokines are generally referred to as being produced by lymphocyte cells. Examples of cytokines include, but are not limited to Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF), Interleukin-1 (EL-IX Interleukin-2 (EL-2), Interleukin-6 (EL-6), Interleukin-8<br>
(IL-8), Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-a) and Tumor Necrosis Factor-beta (TNF-p).<br>
As used herein, the tema "cytokine interfering" or "cytokine suppressive amount" refers to an effective amount of a compound of Formula I or H which will căuşe a decrease either in the biologica! activity or the level of the cytokine present in vivo or in vitro, or the in vivo level of the cytokine to normal or sub-normal levels, when given to a patient for the treatment of a disease state which is exacerbated by, or caused by, excessive or unregulated cytokine production.<br>
As used herein, the cytokine referred to in the phrase "inhibition of a cytokine for use in the treatment of a HlV-infected human" is a cytokine which is imph'cated in (a) the initiation and/or mamtenance of T cell activation and/or activated T ceU-mediated HTV gene cxpression and/or replication and/or (b) any cytokme-iDediated disease associated problem such as cachexia or muscle decenefation.<br>
As TNF-P (also known as rymphotoxin) bas close structural homology with TNF-a (also known as cachectin) and since each induces similar biologic responses and binds to the same cellular receptor, both TNF-a and TNF-(3 are inhibited by the compounds of the present invention and thus are herein referred to collectively as "TNF" unless specifically delineated otherwise.<br>
These inhibitor compounds of Formula I or n are of aid in determining the signaling pathways invorvement in inflammatory responses. In particular, a definitive signal transduction pathway can be prescribed to the action of lipopolysaccharide in cytokine production in macrophages. In addition to those diseases already noted herein, treatment of stroke, neurotrauma/CNS head injury,<br>
cardiac, brain and renal reperfusion injury, thrombosis, glomerulonephritis, diabetes and pancreatic cells, multiple sclerosis, muscle degeneration, eczema, psoriasis, sunburn, and conjunctivitis are also included.<br>
It is also recognized that both IL-6 and BL-8 are produced during rhinovirus<br>

It bas also been demonstrated in vitro that infection of pubnonary ephbelial cells wtth HRV resuhs in production of IL-6 and IL-8 (&amp;tea&amp;&amp;sL J- Clin. Invest (1995), Voi. 96, p. 549). Epitbclial cells represent thc primary site of infection of HRV. Therefore, another aspect of the prestat invcation is a method of treatmentto reduce inflammation associated with a rhinovirus Mection, not necessarity a direct effect of the virus itself.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention involves the novei use of these cytokine inhibitors for the treatment of chronic inflammatory or proliferative or angiogenic diseases, which are caused by excessive, or inappropriate angiogenesis. Chronic diseases which have an inappropriate angiogenic component are various ocular neovascularizations, such as diabetic retinopathy and macular degeneration. Other chronic diseases which have an excessive or increased proliferation of vasculature are tumor growth and metastasis, atherosclerosis and certain arthritic conditions. Therefore, cytokine inhibitors will be of utility in the blocking of the angiogenic component of these disease states.<br>
The term "excessive or increased proliferation of vasculature inâppropriate angiogenesis" as med herein includes, but is not limited to, diseases which are characterized by hemangiomas and ocular diseases.<br>
The term "mappropriate angiogenesis" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, diseases which are characterized by vesicle proliferation with accompanying tissue proliferation, such as occurs in cancer, metastasis, arthritis and atherosclerosis.<br>

As an exampfe of the methods of treatment of the present invention, isoxazoUne-containing compounds of the present invention can be used to treat patients with ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). ARDSisoften considered to be an archetypal clinica! response in which the dynamic balance within the immune response shifts toward excessive inflammation and tissue destruction. MIF is expressed in both type H alveolar cells and infiltrating immune cells. MEF levels in me bronchoalveolar lavage of ARDS patients were found to be significantly elevated when compared to control subjects (Donnelly, eţ a)., Nat. Med., 3,320-323 (1997)). Human MIF enhances both TNFa and IL-8 secretion from ARDS alveolar macrophages (ex vfvo) when compared to control cells. Pre-treatment of these cells with anti-MIF antibodies significantly decreases TNFa and<br>
DL-8 prodnction firom ARDS alveolar cells. Moreover, as discussed above under "Background of tbe Invention," rMEF (recombinant MBF) was foimd to override, in a concentraticm-dependent fashion, glucocorticoid-mediated inhibition of cytokine secretion in ARDS macrophages. These were the first data to indicate that the MIF/glucocorticoid dyad is active in cells that hâd undergone pro-inflammatory activation m vivo during human disease (Donnellv. et al.. Nat. Med., 3,320-323 (l 997). Significantly elevated levels of alveolar MIF were found in those at-risk patients who progressed to ARDS compared to those who did not. MIF likely acts as an important mediator to promote and sustain the pulmonary inflammatory response in ARDS. Its prominent expression in ARDS may explain the fulminant course of this disease and pexhaps wfay glucocorticoid treatment has proven disappointing in estebKshed cascs. Thus, phannaceutkal compositions comprising isoxazoline-containing ccmpounds of &amp;e present invention can be used to treat ARDS patients.<br>
As a further example of the methods of treatment of the present invention, isoxazoline-containing compounds of the present invention can be used to treat patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Synovial fluid obtained from the affected joints of patients with rheumatoid arthritis contain significantly greater levels of MIF than those obtained from patients with osteoartnritis or from normal control subjects (Metz. et al.. Adv. Immunol., 66,197-223 (1997); Leech. et al.. Arthritis Rheum., 41,910-917 (1998); Onodera. et al.. Cytokine, 11,163-167 (1999)). As revealed by immunohistochemical staining methods, infiltrating mononuclear cells within the human arthritic joint are the primary source of MIF. In two animal models of arthritis, neutralizing anti-MEF mAb's significantly inhibited disease progression<br>

Immunol., 158, 5514-5517 (1997)) giving impetus to the desirability of developing additional MIF inhibitors for potenţial therapeutic use in inflammatory disease. Thus, pharmaceutical compositions comprising isoxazoline compounds or isoxazoline-related compounds of the present invention can be used to treat arthritis patients.<br>
In yet a further example of the methods of treatment of the present invention, isoxazoline-containing compounds of the present invention can be used to treat patients with atopic dennatitis.  Atopic dermatitis is a chronic pruritic inflammatory sicin disorder. Its palhogenesis, in part, is tix&gt;ught to be due to<br>

The scrum MEF level of atopic dermatitis patients were 6-fold higher tium in control subjects. Additionally, serum MIF levels in atopic dermatitis patients decreased as clinica! features improved, suggesting that MIF plays a pivotai role in the inflammatory response in the skin during dermatitis. Thus, pharmaceutical compositions comprising isoxazoline-containing compounds of the present invention can be used to treat patients with atopic dermatitis.<br>
In a similar manner, the present invention also provides a method for treating or preventing other inflammatory or autoimmune disorders including, but not limited to, proliferative vascular disease, cytokine-mediated toxicity, sepsis,<br>

synthesis or by other cytokines affected by MIF. In yet another example of tbe methods of treatment of the present invention, compounds of the present invention can be used to treat patients wfth tumor growth. Neutralizing anti-MIF antibodies have been found to significantly reduce growth and vascularization (angiogenesis) of mouse 38C13 B cell rymphoma in vfvo rChesnev. et ai.. Mol.

Synthesis. In the examples of the syntheses that follow, all reagents and solvents used were purchased at the highest commercial quality. AU solvents used were HPLC grade lBx&gt;m Fisher. 1H (270 MHz) and "CNMR (67.5 MHz) NMR spectra were recorded on a JEOL Eclipse 270 spectrometer. Coupling constants were reported in Hertz (Hz), and chemical shifts were reported in parts per million (ppm) relative to tetramethylsilane (TMS, 0.0 ppm) with CDClj, DMSO or CD3OD as solvent. Thin layer (TLC) and flash column chromatography were performed<br>
using Alumina B, F-254 TLC plates from Selecto Scientific and Fisher Scientific Basic alumina Brockman activity I, respectivery. The reactions were monitored by TLC and 'HNMR and were stopped when the yield of the crude according to 'HNMR was 90-95%.<br>
Reagents. Unless otherwise indicated, aii chemicals were purchased from Aldrich or Sigma Chemical Companies, and were of the highest grade commercially available.  Dopachrome methyl ester was prepared similarly to previousry published procedures (Bendrat et al.. Biochemistry, 36,15356-15362 (1997); Swope.etal.. EMBO J„ 17, 3534-3541 (1998)).<br>
Assays were initiated at a time when mc absorbance ai 475 nm reached a maximal vame, sjgmrytngthatthe hmitmgieagent, NaIO4,was consumed. Recombinant human and moaşe MIF was expiessed in E. coti and purified as previousry reported (Bemhagan,, ţţ * Bkxdkemistry, 33, 14144-14155 (1994). MIF Tautornerasc<br>
The compounds of Formula I or II are identified as KfîF inhibitors because they inhibit MIF enzymatic activity in vitro. MIF catalyzes a tautomerization (i.e., keto-enol isomerization) reaction (Rosengreru et al.. Molecular Medicine, 2, 143-1 49 (l 996). MIF catalyzes the tautomerization of a dopachrome-related MIF substrate to a colorless product Unless specifically indicated to the contrary, references made herein to an inhibitory concentration (e. g., ICX or other activity index) refer to the inhibitory activity of a test compound in an MIF tautomerase assay (as further described in detail below, and in Bendrat et al.. Biochemistry, 36, 15356-15362 (1997). The most active substrate identified is a non-physiological D-isomer of dopachrome. This reaction predicts therapeutic MIF inhibitors (see<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,420,188 and U.S. Patent No. 6,599,938, the disclosures of which are încorporated herein by referencc in tbeir cntirety), InhibitionofMIF tautomerase activity is predictive of inhibition of MIF biologica! activity.<br>
A method for performing an assay for MIF dopachrome tautomerase activity begins with the preperation and oxidation of a DOP A-related substrate precursor, such as L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalaniiie methyl ester. This oxidation with sodium periodate generates the corresponding dopachrome derivative (e. g., L-3,5-dihYdro-6-hydroxy-5-oxo-2H-indole-2-carboxylic acid methyl ester ("dopachrome methyl ester") that is orange-colored and comprises a convenient substrate for use in a photometric assay fot the enzymatic activity of MIF as a tautomerase. MIF (typicaîly a purified prepantion of recombînaiitMIFatafinalconcentrationof 50-<br>
substrate to a colorless 5&gt;6Kfinvdroxytndoie~2-caboxyh*c acid methyl ester product The enzymatic actrvhy of MIF is measured as the rate of dc-colorization of the colored sohition of the dopachrome-felated substrate in a suitaMe buffer, typicaîly at a time 20 seconds ader additkm of the final assay component and mixing. The absorbance is measured at about 475 nm (or 550 nm for substrate concentrations in excess 0.5 nM). A test compound may be included in the assay solution such that the effect of the test compound on MIF tautomerase activity (i. e., as an inhibitor) may be measured by noting the change in kinetics of substrate tautomerization compared to control assays performed in the absence of the test inhibitor compound. In particular, the MIF tautomerase assay may be conducted essentially as follows:<br>
L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalaniDe methyl ester (e.g., Sigma D-1507) is a dopachrome aubstrate precursor, and is prepared as a 4 mM solution in dd HjO. Sodium periodate is prepared as an 8 mM solution in dd H2O. Assay Buffer (50 mM potassium phosphate/1 mM EDTA, pH 6.0) is prepared. Purified recombinant MBF is prepared in 150 mM NaCl/20 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.4) as a stock solution convenient to suppry MEP at a final concentration of about 700 ng/ml. Immediately prior to iniuatmg the assay, 3.6 ml dopachrome substrate precursor solution» 2.4 ml periodate solution and 4.0 ml Assay Buffer are combined into a homogeneous mixture (this preparation of dopachrome substrate is suitable for assay use after l mmaixlforaboutBOmmthereaftar). Test compound (typicalry prepared as a «&gt;ncentratedstockmDMSO)andMIFaretbracombinedwithOJmlAss Buffer plus 0.3 ml dopachrome substrate solution to provide the desired final concentration of the test compound in a homogerieous mixture, and the optical density (absorbance) of Uns assay mixture is monhored at 475 nm. Typicalry, ODm is recorded every 5 sec for 0-60 sec, and the OD, for a grventime point is compared to parallel assays where MIF is not added or the test compound is omitted. Inhibition of MIF tautomerase activity by the test compounds is detennined by inhibition of the de-colorization of the assay mixture, often at the 20 sec time point. ICW values for compounds with MIF tautomerase inhibitory activity, corresponding to the concentration of inhibitor that would inhibit MIF tautomerase activity by 50%, are detennined by interpolation of the results from MIF tautomerase assays at severa! different inhibitor concentrations. These IC50 values provide a reasonable correlation between MIF enzymatic inhibitory activity of the test compounds, and inhibition of the biologica! activity of MIF.<br>
The MIF tautomerase assay shows that certam compounds inhibit MIF enzymatic actrvity. The data pcovides a reasonable correlation between the MIF tautomerase enzymatic assay and MIF antagonism in a biologica! assay. Collectivery, these data show mat inhibition by a compound in the MIF tautomerase assay is predictive of its potenţial therapeutic use in inhibiting MIF biologica! activity. mbibition of MIF is also reasonably correlated to the modulation of other cytokines affected by MIF and the ERK/MAPK pathway. Treatment of MIF whfa Inhibitors.<br>
MIF samples were treated whh various concentrations of the inhibitors and treated MIF samples were then anaryzed fior enzyme activity using the dopachrome tautomerase assay. Dopacnromc Tautomerase Assavs.<br>
To a room tempenture somtion of recombinant mouse or human MEF samples was added dopacbrome metbyl ester. The sample was immediateiy monitored for loss in absorbance at 475 mn compared to untreated MIF solutions and to dopachrome methyl ester without the addition of MIF. Enzyme Inhibitipn Studies.<br>
This assay illustrates the inhibition of the enzymatic activity of human MIF by the compounds of the invention. The enzymatic tautomerization activity of recombinant human MIF was performed using L-dopachrome methyl ester as a chromogenic substrate (Bendrat et al.. Biochemistry, 36,15356-15362 (1997)). The tautomerization reaction catalyzed by MIF, as described in detail above, leads to the formation of a dihydroxyindole product which is colorless.<br>
Severa! compounds were prepared and tested for acti vity in the MIF dopachrome tautomerase assay. Compounds 68 and 69 (TABLE I) inhibited MIF tautomerase activity in a dose-dependent manner with an IC of about 10 uM.<br>
Thus, according to the present invention, the compounds related in structure to compound 68 and 69 comprise a new and general class of low molecular weight, specific inhibitors of MIF enzymatic activity. Biologica! Assay of MIF Activity.<br>
This assay shows mat the compounds not only specifically inhibit MIF enzymatic activity, but also inhibit MO7 immunoregulatory actrvities, specifically, MBP glucocorticoid regulating activity. The abih'ty of compounds according to the inventkm to neutraHze the effect of MIF to inftuence the anti-mflammatory erfect oo Tha production by mnian monocytes is tested.  The property of the compound is dote dependent Toaddress the specificity of tiusinhiDitory effect on MBF, other analogs arc tested mat arc not such potent inhibitors of MIF tautomerase activity.<br>
These results are consistent with a hypothesis mat the pro-inflammatory effects of MIF can be neutralized by the binding of a small molecule at the tautomerase active site, although this effect is not believed to depend on the neutralization of tautomerase activity per se.<br>
The compounds are additionally assessed for inhibition of MIF biologica! activities in any of a number of assays for MIF biologica! activity including, for example, inhibition of MIF binding to target cells, inhibition of MIF release or synthesis, inhibition of MIF immunoreactivity with MIF-specific antibodies, alterations of MIF conformation or structura! integrity as assessed by circular<br>
