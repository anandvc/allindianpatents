COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See section 10; rule 13]<br>
MOUTH DISSOLVING VINPOCETINE COMPOSITIONS'<br><br><br>
(a)	M/s LYKA LABS LIMITED.<br>
(b)	77, Nehru Road, Vile Parle (East), Mumbai - 400 099, Maharashtra, India<br>
(c)	Indian Company incorporated under the Companies Act 1956<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br>
Technical field:<br>
This invention relates to rapidly disintegrating, fast dissolving oral solid dosage form composition of vinpocetine that dissolves in mouth. This invention further relates to mouth dissolving tablets of vinpocetine.<br>
Background and prior art:<br>
Vinpocetine chemically known as ethyl apovincaminate is prepared by slightly and suitably modifying the vincamine alkaloid obtained from vinca minor, the periwinkle plant. The active agent, apovincaminic acid ethyl ester is disclosed in US patent No. 4035370. Thereinafter, this active agent is designated by its generic name, Vinpocetine. Vinpocetine has been in use for more than 25 years. Vinpocetine is a cerebral metabolic enhancer. It is used in the treatment of cerebrovascular disorders.lt is useful for a wide range of diseases like cerebral arterio-sclerosis, senile dementia and is a selective cerebral vasodilator.<br>
Other suitable ester forms of apovincaminic acid are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,035,370 and include the butyl ester, the allyl ester, the benzyl ester, and the ethyl ester methoiodide forms. The preferred ester form is the ethyl ester, i.e. apovincaminic acid ethyl ester, vinpocetine.<br>
Vinpocetine is administered to humans either orally or parenterally. For many reasons oral administration is preferred.<br>
Vinpocetine being effective when taken orally, tablets of vinpocetine (5mg) are commercially marketed for over 25 years.<br><br>
Mouth dissolving tablets and granules offer many added benefits and advantages over conventional tablet dosage forms. These solid dosage forms of present invention dissolves in mouth and are particularly useful for subjects that require or desire oral medication but have difficulty in swallowing oral dosage form such as tablets, capsules. Very ofteji, infants, children, convalescent, aged people and subjects suffering from emesis have difficulty in swallowing tablets, capsules.<br>
Secondly, conventional tablets or capsules require water or other liquids or drinks to swallow the tablet that becomes inconvenient to be administered during travel and other times. Mouth dissolving tablets of vinpocetine are suitably formulated to spontaneously disintegrate/ dissolve in the oral cavity as in contact with saliva in 30 seconds to 60 seconds after introducing into the mouth, without having to consume water or any other drink along with it. Hence it is very convenient to take these tablets any where any time.<br>
These tablets of present invention are also sweetened and flavored to make them palatable. Taste- masking of active ingredient is also done in mouth dissolving tablets thereby increasing patient compliance.<br>
Absorption of conventional tablets are often slower as dissolution of drug takes place after swallowing and disintegrating. Mouth dissolving tablets are also useful for rapid drug delivery for sublingual or buccal administration of the drug.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,035,370 describes various dosage forms for oral or parenteral administration of vinpocetine.<br>
US patent 6663883 describes matrix adhering to nasal mucosa involving drugs exerting their effects in the brain, comprising a polyglycerol fatty acid ester.<br>
An effervescent composition involving at least one physiologically active substance comprising a core-shell powder is reported in US patent 5824339.<br><br>
Methods for making quick-dissolving oral mucosal delivery devices offering measured and controlled release of an active agent or a combination of active agents are described in US patent application 2003118653.<br>
Russian patent RU 2155039 describes pharmaceutical compositions of vinpocetine in the form of conventional tablets and its method of preparation.<br>
Even though, there are various patents available on vinpocetine, there are no prior art patent available on vinpocetine mouth dissolving tablets or granules.<br>
Objective of this Invention:<br>
The objective of present invention is to provide an oral solid dosage form composition of Vinpocetine which rapidly disintegrating, fast dissolving as in contact with saliva in mouth. An easily administrable mouth dissolving tablet composition of vinpocetine, which helps a faster onset of the therapeutic effect on the brain.<br>
Summary of the Invention:<br>
Mouth dissolving tablet dosage forms of vinpovetine are described. Mouth dissolving tablets are prepared by using ingredients that are having good compressibility, gives good sufficient strength when compressed. They can be directly mixed and compressed without granulation or alternatively, after granulation process. When ingested in mouth, it rapidly disintegrates within 30 to 300 seconds. These tablets are formulated to get good organoleptic acceptance. They are suitably sweetened and flavored to mask the unacceptable taste of the therapeutically active substance.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention:<br>
Tablet Composition of the present invention are suitably formulated to dissolve in mouth as soon as it comes in contact with saliva in buccal cavity within 30 seconds to 60<br><br>
seconds. Various embodiments of the Invention are formulated with suitable excipients. One or more of excipients in the present invention may be selected from diluent, binder, disintegrant, flow promoters, anti adherent, flavours and sweetening agents in different embodiments.<br>
The present invention utilizes one or more of the diluents used either alone or in combination with other diluents, may be selected from water soluble diluents well known in the art such as mannitol, sorbitol,xylitol, lactose monohydrate, sucrose, Glucose, Fructose, Calcium carbonate and Maltodextrin. Diluents such as maize starch, potato starch, cellulose material such as microcrystalline cellulose are less preferred than more preffered such as mannitol, sorbitol, and lactose as they form low density matrix which disintegrates rapidly in mouth. However the most preferred diluent for present invention is mannitol as it gives very good mouth feel when mouth dissolving tablet disintegrates / dissolves in mouth. This diluent either alone or in combination may be used in the range from 20% weight up to 90% weight of total formulation.<br>
The tablet composition of present invention consists of binder selected from synthetic gums such as methylcellulose, carboxy methylcellulose and its sodium salt, hydroxy propyl cellulose low substitution (LHPC), hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), povidone (PVPK.30). They may be used in the range from 1% weight up to 6% weight of total formulation, preferably in 3%-5% weight.<br>
Flow property enhancer / antiadherents may be selected from Talc, colloidal silicon dioxide (Aerosil), magnesium stearate, sodium steryl fumarate. They may be used in the range from 0.5% weight up to 5% weight of total formulation, preferably used in 3%-4% weight.<br>
Disintegrants may be selected from celluloses such as microcrystalline cellulose, crosslinked carboxymethyl cellulose sodium salt, maize starch, sodium starch glycollate, polymers like hydroxyproylmethyl cellulose. They may be used in the range from 1%<br><br>
weight up to 5% weight of total formulation, preferably used concentration in present invention in 3%-4% weight.<br>
One or more sweetening agents to make the solid dosage form of present invention palatable may be chosen from artificial sweeteners such as aspartame, sodium saccharin, sodium cyclamate, acesulfame potassium or sweetner from natural origin like Sodium glycerrhizinate,mono ammonium glycyrrhizinate (magnasweet) are used in different embodiments. They may be used in the range from 1% weight up to 3% weight of total formulation, preferably used concentration in present invention in 1.5%-2.5% weight. Different artificial flavours are used to provide palatability.<br>
i<br>
To mask the taste of active ingredient, methacrylic acid co-polymer (eudragit) is used and also beta-cyclodextrin is used. Various embodiments of the invention are described in examples 1 to 11.<br>

STEP 10 Mixed the lubricants of step 9 with blend of step 5 and step 8 together to get<br>
uniform blend.<br>
STEP11 :The lubricated blend is compressed to obtain circularflat,bevelled scoredtablets.<br>
Average Wt. per tablet = 180 mg Dia = 8.0mm Hardness = 2-6 kg/cm2<br>
