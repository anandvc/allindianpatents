SAME<br>
Technical Field<br>
[1]	The present invention relates to an ionic liquid gel polymer electrolyte formed by<br>
polymerizing an electrolyte precursor solution comprising an ionic liquid and a<br>
monomer capable of forming a gel polymer by polymerization. The present invention<br>
also relates to an electrochromic device comprising the above ionic liquid gel polymer<br>
electrolyte and a method for manufacturing the same.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2]	In general, electrochromic devices are referred to as devices that experience a<br>
change in color due to an electrochemical redox reaction caused by the application of<br>
an electric field, resulting in a change in light transmission characteristics. Typical<br>
electrochromic materials include tungsten oxides found by S. K. Deb in 1969.<br>
Thereafter, electrochromism of various organic/inorganic materials has been studied,<br>
followed by continuous development and research into the application of elec-<br>
trochromic devices comprising such materials in the field of smart window and display<br>
technology.<br>
[3]	Electrochromic materials are classified into reduction-colored materials and<br>
oxidation-colored materials. Reduction-colored materials are those colored by the ac-<br>
quisition of electrons and typically include tungsten oxides. Meanwhile, oxidation-<br>
colored materials are those colored by the loss of electrons and typically include nickel<br>
oxides and cobalt oxides. Other electrochromic materials include inorganic metal<br>
oxides such as Ir(OH)x , MoO3 , V2O5 , TiO2 , etc., conductive polymers such as PEDOT<br>
(poly-3,4-ethylenedioxy thiophene), polypyrrole, polyaniline, polyazulene, poly-<br>
thiophene, polypyridine, polyindole, polycarbazole, polyazfne, polyquinone, etc., and<br>
organic electrochromic materials such as viologen, anthraquinone, phenocyazine, etc.<br>
[4]	The above inorganic metal oxides generate a change in color when lithium ions or<br>
hydrogen ions present in an electrolyte are doped into the inorganic metal oxides. On<br>
the contrary, as depicted in the following formula 1, conductive polymers, for example,<br>
polyaniline shows a light yellow color when it is present in a completely reduced state,<br>
while showing a blue color when it is present in a state doped with anions by<br>
oxidation. Various colors can be realized depending on the kinds of such conductive<br>
polymer.<br>
[5]	[Formula 1]<br><br>
conductive polymer.<br>
[5]	[Formula 1]<br><br>
[6]	In addition to the above-mentioned inorganic metal oxides and conductive<br>
polymers, organic electrochrome materials include viologen compounds such as<br>
4,4'-dipyridinium salt represented by the following formula 2. A viologen compound<br>
has three types of oxidation states, i.e., V2+ (colorless), V + (blue) and V0 (light yellow),<br>
each oxidation state showing a different color:<br>
[7]	[Formula 2]<br>
[8]<br><br>
[9]	Meanwhile, US Patent No. 5,441,827 (Graetzel et al.) discloses a device having<br>
high efficiency and high response rate, the device being manufactured by coating an<br>
electrcchemically active organic viologen compound, as a single layer, onto the<br>
surface of a nanoporous thin film electrode obtained by sintering metal oxide<br>
nanoparticles. Additionally, the device uses a mixture of a lithium salt with an organic<br>
solvent such as γ-butyrolactone and propylene carbonate, as liquid electrolyte.<br>
However, the device using an organic solvent-containing liquid electrolyte has dis-<br>
advantages in that quenching rate is low, residual images are present after quenching<br>
and that the organfc materials may be decomposed easily during repeated developing/<br>
quenching cycles. Moreover, because the device uses an organic solvent-containing<br>
liquid electrolyte, it has additional disadvantages in that evaporation and exhaustion of<br><br><br>

liquid electrolyte, it has additional disadvantages in that evaporation and exhaustion of<br>
the electrolyte may occur, the electrolyte may leak out from the device to cause an en-<br>
vironmentally unfavorable problem, and that formation into thin films and film-shaped<br>
products is not allowed.<br><br>
[10]	US Patent No. 5,827,602 (V.R. Koch et al.) discloses an ionic liquid electrolyte<br>
based on AlCl3 -EMICI (aluminum chloride-1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride)<br>
including a strong Lewis acid. The ionic liquid such as AlCl3 -EMICI has no vapor<br>
pressure, and thus can solve the problem of exhaustion and decomposition of<br>
electrolyte. However, it may emit toxic gases when exposed to a small amount of<br>
moisture and oxygen. Moreover, the ionic liquid is problematic in that it has high<br>
reactivity with organic/inorganic compounds added to the electrolyte in a small amount<br>
and that it is easily decomposed at a temperature of 150 °C or higher.<br>
[11]	US Patent No. 6,667,825 (Wen Lu et al.) discloses an electrochromic device that<br>
uses a conductive polymer and an ionic liquid such as [BMTM][BF4] containing no<br>
Lewis acid, as electrode and electrolyte, respectively. Use of the ionic liquid<br>
containing no Lewis acid results in improvement of stability and lifespan of elec-<br>
trochromic devices. Additionally, it is possible to solve, at least in part, the problems<br>
with which organic solvent-based liquid electrolytes and ionic liquid electrolytes<br>
containing a Lewis acid are faced, i.e., the problems of residual images after<br>
quenching, decomposition of electrolytes or the like. However, because the elec-<br>
trochromic device according to US Patent No. 6,667,825 uses an ionic liquid as liquid<br>
electrolyte, it still has problems in that leakage of electrolyte may occur and that<br>
formation into thin films and film-shaped products is not allowed.<br>
[12]	In order to complement such disadvantages of liquid electrolytes, polymer<br>
electrolytes have appeared recently. For example, Maroco-A.De Paoli discloses a<br>
polymer electrolyte formed by mixing an organic liquid compound with<br>
poly(epichlorohydrin-co-ethylene oxide) (see, Electrochimica Acta 46, 2001,<br>
4243-4249). However, the above polymer electrolyte shows a significantly low con-<br>
ductivity of about 10-5 S/cm. Additionally, S. A. Agnihotry discloses a polymer<br>
electrolyte having a high ion conductivity of 10-3 S/cm at room temperature, the<br>
polymer electrolyte being formed by adding a small amount of PMMA (polymethyl<br>
methacrylate) polymer and fumed silica to an electrolyte formed of propylene<br>
carbonate containing 1M LiClO4 added thereto (see, Electrochimica Acta. 2004).<br>
However, because the above polymer electrolyte still uses an organic solvent as<br>
electrolyte, it is not possible to solve the problems of low quenching rate, residual<br>
images after quenching, decomposition and exhaustion of organic solvent-based <br>
electrolytes, or the like.<br>
Description of Accompanying Drawings<br>
[13]	The foregoing and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention<br>
will become more apparent from the following detailed description when taken in<br>
conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which:<br>
[14]	FIG. 1 is a sectional view showing a conventional electrochromic device;<br><br>
[15]	FIG. 2 is a graph showing reflectance of the electrochromic device according to<br>
Example 1; and<br>
[16]	FIG. 3 is a graph showing reflectance of the electrochromic device according to<br>
Example 7.<br>
Disclosure<br>
[17]	Therefore, the present invention has been made in view of the above-mentioned<br>
problems. It is an object of the present invention to provide an electrochromic device<br>
using a gel polymer electrolyte impregnated with an ionic liquid, with no use of<br>
organic solvent. According to the electrochromic device of the present invention, it is<br>
possible to solve the problems with which conventional electrochromic devices using<br>
an ionic liquid present in a liquid state as electrolyte are faced, such problems being<br>
that leakage of electrolyte may occur and that formation into thin films and film-<br>
shaped products is not allowed. Additionally, it is possible to solve the problems of<br>
significantly low conductivity of polymer electrolytes according to the prior art.<br>
Further, it is possible to solve the problems caused by organic solvents used in polymer<br>
electrolytes having high ion conductivity according to the prior art.<br>
[18]	According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided an elec-<br>
trochromic device, which includes: (a) a first electrode; (b) a second electrode; (c) an<br>
electrochromic material; and (d) a gel polymer electrolyte containing an ionic liquid. A<br>
method for manufacturing the same device is also provided.<br>
[19]	According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided an<br>
electrolyte useful for the above electrochromic device.<br>
[20]	Hereinafter, the present invention will be explained in more detail.<br>
[21]	The present invention is characterized in that the gel polymer electrolyte is formed<br>
by using an ionic liquid combined with a monomer capable of forming a gel polymer<br>
by polymerization, wherein the ionic liquid substitutes for an organic solvent used as a<br>
constitutional element of liquid electrolyte or gel polymer electrolytes in conventional<br>
electrochromic devices.<br>
[22]	The ionic liquid gel polymer electrolyte does not use organic solvents that cause<br>
leakage of electrolyte, side reactions with other constituents and inapplicability to thin<br>
film formation and to processing into film-shaped products. Therefore, the ionic liquid<br>
gel polymer electrolyte can improve the safety of an electrochromic device as well as<br>
contribute to facilitate processing and handling during the manufacturing process of an<br>
electrochromic device.<br>
[23]	Additionally, because the ionic liquid has high ionic concentration, it can provide<br>
performances comparable to those of liquid electrolytes, even if it takes the form of a<br>
gel polymer.<br>
[24]	Further, the gel polymer is formed by injecting an electrolyte precursor solution<br><br>
including an ionic liquid and a monomer capable of forming a gel polymer by poly-<br>
merization between both electrodes of an electrochromic device and then carrying out<br>
in-situ polymerization inside of the electrodes. Accordingly, it is not necessary to<br>
perform an additional post-treatment step (for example, a step of removing solvent) so<br>
that the manufacturing process of an electrochromic device can be facilitated and<br>
simplified, and thus can be cost-efficient.<br>
[25]	1. Ionic Liquid Gel Polymer Electrolyte<br>
[26]	One constitutional element forming the gel polymer electrolyte according to the<br>
present invention is an ionic liquid.<br>
[27]	Generally, an ionic salt compound consisting of a metal cation and non-metal<br>
anion, such as salt (NaCl), melts at a high temperature of 800 °C or higher. On the<br>
contrary, an ionic liquid is an ionic salt present in a liquid state at a temperature of 100<br>
°C or less. Particularly, an ionic liquid present in a liquid state at room temperature is<br>
referred to as an RTIL (room temperature ionic liquid).<br>
[28]	Because an ionic liquid is non-volatile, it has no vapor pressure and shows high ion<br>
conductivity. Particularly, because an ionic liquid has strong polarity to dissolve<br>
inorganic and organic compounds well and is characteristically present in a liquid state<br>
at a broad range of temperatures, it can be applied to various fields of chemistry<br>
including catalysts, separation technology and electrochemistry. Additionally, an ionic<br>
liquid has a decreased melting temperature due to its low symmetricity, weak inter-<br>
molecular attraction force and charge distribution in cations. Further, an ionic liquid<br>
has non-toxicity, inflammability and excellent thermal stability as well as shows<br>
physicochemical characteristics as environmental-friendly advanced solvent capable of<br>
substituting for conventional toxic organic solvents. Such physicochemical charac-<br>
teristics include a broad range of temperatures where it can be present as liquid, high<br>
solvation capability and non-coordination bond forming capability.<br>
[29]	Physical and chemical properties of an ionic liquid are significantly affected by the<br>
structure of the cation and anion in the ionic liquid and may be optimized depending<br>
on user's demands. For example, properties of l-alkyl-3-methyl imidazolium<br>
derivatives as ionic liquid can be controlled by simply varying the length of alkyl<br>
group, even though they have the same anion.<br>
[30]	The ionic liquid used in the present invention may be formed of an organic cation<br>
and inorganic anion. Compatibility of an ionic liquid with a vinyl monomer varies<br>
depending on the kind of anion. Such compatibility critically affects the transparency<br>
of a gel polymer electrolyte using the ionic liquid and vinyl monomer. The kind of<br>
anion in an ionic liquid determines whether the ionic liquid is hydrophilic or hy-<br>
drophobic. Particularly, in the case of a hydrophobic ionic liquid, a vinyl monomer<br>
such as HEMA (2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) has poor compatibility with a vinyl<br><br>
monomer, resulting in formation of an opaque gel polymer electrolyte.<br>
[31]	Non-limiting examples of the cation of the ionic liquid that may be used according<br>
to the present invention include the following cations, wherein each of R -R represents<br>
a C1-C9 alkyl group or phenyl group:<br><br>
[32]	Additionally, non-limiting examples of the anion (XT) that may be used according<br>
to the present invention include F-, Cl-, Br-, I-, NO3-, N(CN)2-, BF4-, ClO4-, RSO3-,<br>
RCOO- (wherein R is a C1~C9 alkyl group or phenyl group); PF6 -, (CF3)2 PF4 -, (CF3)3<br>
PF3-, (CF3)4 PF2-, (CF3)5PF-2, (CF3)6P-, (CF3SO3)2, (CF2CF2SO3)2, (CF3SO3)2 N-, CF3CF<br>
2(CF3)2 CO-, (CF3SO2)2CH-, (SF5)3C-, (CF3SO2)3C-, CF3(CF2)7SO3-, CF3CO2-, CH3CO2-<br>
, etc.<br>
[33]	The other constitutional element forming the gel polymer electrolyte according to<br>
the present invention is a conventional monomer known to one skilled in the art. There<br>
is no limitation in the kind of monomer as long as it is capable of forming a gel<br>
polymer by polymerization.<br>
[34]	The monomer capable of forming a gel polymer by polymerization includes vinyl<br>
monomers, etc. Vinyl monomers have advantages in that they can provide transparent<br>
polymerization products when mixed with an ionic liquid and that they are amenable to<br>
simple polymerization conditions.<br><br>
[35]	Non-limiting examples of the vinyl monomer that may be used according to the<br>
present invention include acrylonitrile, methyl methacrylate, methyl acrylate,<br>
methacrylonitrile, methyl styrene, vinyl esters, vinyl chloride, vinylidene chloride,<br>
acrylamide, tetrafluoroethylene, vinyl acetate, methyl vinyl ketone, ethylene, styrene,<br>
para-methoxystyrene, para-cyanostyrene, polyethylene glycols (PEG), etc. Any poly-<br>
merizable monomers other than the above vinyl monomers may be used.<br>
[36]	Preferably, the monomer capable of forming a gel polymer with an ionic liquid<br>
through polymerization provides low volumetric shrinkage upon polymerization and<br>
permits in-situ polymerization inside of an electrochromic device.<br>
[37]	The gel polymer electrolyte according to the present invention is formed by<br>
polymerizing the electrolyte precursor solution comprising the ionic liquid and the<br>
monomer capable of forming a gel polymer by polymerization. The electrolyte<br>
precursor solution may further comprise a lithium salt or acid.<br>
[38]	Generally, electrochromic devices based on electron movement (for example, elec-<br>
trochromic devices using conductive polymers, organic compounds such as viologen<br>
derivatives, etc.) have no need of a lithium salt, because they are formed of a great<br>
number of ions. However, in the case of an electrochromic device using an electrode<br>
formed of inorganic metal oxides such as WO , NiO, etc., there is a need of a lithium<br>
salt because the electrochromic device allows a change in color when a lithium ion is<br>
inserted into the electrode. Additionally, an electrochromic device using inorganic<br>
metal oxides has a need of acid, because the electrochromism based on the inorganic<br>
metal oxides can also be realized when protons (H4) present in the electrolyte are<br>
doped into the inorganic metal oxides.<br>
[39]	Any lithium salts or acids known to one skilled in the art may be used. Preferred<br>
and particular examples of the lithium salt include lithium salts consisting of a lithium<br>
cation (Li+) and the anion contained in the ionic liquid, for example, F-, Cl-, Br-, I-, NO<br>
-, N(CN)2-, BF4-, CIO4 -, RSO3-, RCOO- (wherein R is a C1-C9 alkyl group or phenyl<br>
group); PF6-, (CF3)2PF4-,(CF3)PF3-, (CF3)4PF2-, (CF3)5PF-, (CF3)6P-, (CF3SO3)2, (CF2<br>
CF2SO3-)2, (CF SO3)2N-, CF CF2(CF)2CO-, (CF SO2)2CH-, (SF5)3C-, (CF3SO2)3C-, CF3<br>
(CF2)7SO3-, CF3CO2-, CH3CO2-, etc. Preferred examples of the acid include acids<br>
consisting of a proton (H+) and the anion contained in the ionic liquid as described<br>
above. When the anion contained in the lithium salt or acid differs from the anion<br>
forming the ionic liquid, the lithium salt or acid may have low solubility in the ionic<br>
liquid electrolyte.<br>
[40]	Meanwhile, the electrolyte precursor solution may further comprise a conventional<br>
polymerization initiator known to one skilled in the art.<br>
[41]	Thermal initiators that may be used in the polymerization (for example, radical<br>
polymerization initiators) include organic peroxides or hydroperoxides such as b<br><br>
enzoyl peroxide, acetyl peroxide, dilauryl peroxide, di-tert-butyl peroxide, cumyl hy-<br>
droperoxide, hydrogen peroxide, etc., and azo compounds such as<br>
2,2-azobis(2-cyanobutane), 2,2-azobis(methylbutyronitrile),<br>
AIBN(azobis(iso-butyronitrile), AMVN (azobisdimethyl-valeronitrile), etc.<br>
[42]	The above-mentioned initiators are decomposed at a suitable temperature ranging<br>
from 40 °C to 80 °C to form radicals, and then react with a monomer through free<br>
radical polymerization to form a gel polymer electrolyte. It is also possible to carry out<br>
polymerization of monomers without using any initiator. Generally, free radical poly-<br>
merization includes an initiation step in which transient molecules or active points<br>
having strong reactivity are formed; a propagation step in which a monomer is added<br>
to the end of an active chain to form another active point at the end of the chain; a<br>
chain transfer step in which active points are transferred to other molecules; and a<br>
termination step in which the center of an active chain is broken.<br>
[43]	Additionally, UV polymerization initiators such as Irgacure-184, Darocure, etc.,<br>
may be used to form a gel polymer electrolyte through UV polymerization.<br>
[44]	In addition to the above-described materials, the ionic liquid gel polymer<br>
electrolyte according to the present invention optionally further comprises other<br>
additives known to one skilled in the art.<br>
[45]	In order to form the ionic liquid gel polymer electrolyte by using the above-<br>
described electrolyte precursor solution according to a conventional method, three<br>
types of methods described hereinafter may be used.<br>
[46]	The first method comprises forming the gel polymer electrolyte by in-situ poly-<br>
merization inside of an electrode. In-situ polymerization that may be used in the<br>
present invention may be performed by heating or UV irradiation. Additionally,<br>
formation of the gel polymer electrolyte depends on polymerization time and poly-<br>
merization temperature in the case of thermal polymerization, or on irradiation dose in<br>
the case of UV polymerization. Typically, polymerization time ranges from about 20 to<br>
60 minutes and thermal polymerization temperature ranges from 40 to 80 °C.<br>
[47]	Additionally, the mixing ratio in the electrolyte precursor solution according to the<br>
present invention on the weight basis, i.e., the weight ratio of (ionic liquid) x :<br>
(monomer capable of forming a gel polymer by polymerization) y : (polymerization<br>
initiator) z, is 0.5-0.95 : 0.05-0.5 : 0.00-0.05, with the proviso thatx+y+z=1. More<br>
preferably, x is 0.7-0.95, y is 0.05-0.3 and z is 0.00-0.01.<br>
[48]	The second method that may be used in forming the gel polymer electrolyte<br>
comprises injecting the ionic liquid so that a polymer or gel polymer can be im-<br>
pregnated with the ionic liquid. Non-limiting examples of the polymer that may be<br>
used include PMMA, PVdF, PVC, PEO, PHEMA, etc. In this case, it is possible to<br>
simplify processing steps compared to the above in-situ polymerization method.<br><br>
[49]	The third method comprises dissolving the ionic liquid and a polymer in a solvent<br>
and removing the solvent to form a gel polymer electrolyte. In this method, the ionic<br>
liquid is contained in the matrix formed of the polymer as described above.<br>
[50]	Although there is no particular limitation in selecting the solvent, non-limiting<br>
examples of the solvent include toluene, acetone, acetonitrile, THF, etc. Additionally,<br>
there is no particular limitation in the method for removing the solvent and any con-<br>
ventional heating methods may be used. However, the third method has a disadvantage<br>
in that there is a need of a post-treatment step for removing a solvent in order to form<br>
the gel polymer electrolyte.<br>
[51]	According to the present invention, it is important that the gel polymer electrolyte<br>
should be free from leakage and should not cause volumetric shrinking due to over-<br>
polymerization of electrolyte. The gel polymer electrolyte prepared according to the<br>
present invention has an ion conductivity of between 10" and 10" S/cm. Generally, the<br>
higher the ion concentration of electrolyte, the better the performance of an elec-<br>
trochromic device.<br>
[52]	2. Electrochromic Device Using Ionic Liquid Gel Polymer Electrolyte<br>
[53]	The electrochromic device according to the present invention includes a first<br>
electrode and a second electrode, disposed on a transparent or translucent substrate,<br>
and the electrolyte as disclosed herein, wherein the first electrode, the second<br>
electrode, the electrolyte, or combinations thereof include an electrochromic material.<br>
[54]	Non-limiting examples of the electrochromic material that may be used in the<br>
present invention include inorganic metal oxides such as WO , Ir(OH), MoO , V O ,<br>
TiO , NiO, etc.; conductive polymers such as polypyrrole, polyaniline, polyazulene,<br>
polypyridine, poly indole, polycarbazole, polyazine, polythiophene, etc.; and organic<br>
electrochromic materials such as viologen, anthraquinone, phenocyazine, etc.<br>
[55]	The electrochromic device may be manufactured according to a conventional<br>
method known to one skilled in the art. In one embodiment, the method includes the<br>
steps of: (a) providing a first electrode and a second electrode; (b) injecting an<br>
electrolyte precursor solution into the gap between the first electrode and the second<br>
electrode through an inlet and sealing the inlet, wherein the electrolyte precursor<br>
solution comprises (i) an ionic liquid, (ii) a monomer capable of forming a gel polymer<br>
by polymerization, and (iii) a polymerization initiator; and (c) polymerizing the<br>
electrolyte precursor solution to form an ionic liquid gel polymer electrolyte.<br>
[56]	It is preferable that the electrolyte precursor solution comprising the ionic liquid<br>
and the monomer is injected into the gap between both electrodes and then in-situ<br>
polymerization is performed inside of the electrodes to form the ionic liquid gel<br>
polymer electrolyte. This results from the following reasons. It is easier to inject the<br>
electrolyte into the gap between the electrodes compared to injection or lamination of<br><br>
the gel polymer electrolyte impregnated with the ionic liquid into the gap between the<br>
electrodes. Additionally, it is possible to obtain more improved wetting and contacting<br>
capability between the ionic liquid gel polymer electrolyte and the electrodes.<br>
[57]	Particularly, a conventional method for manufacturing an electrochromic device<br>
includes the steps of: dissolving a polymer (for example, PMMA, PVdF, PVC, PEO,<br>
PHEMA, etc.) in an organic solvent (for example, toluene, acetone, acetonitrile, THF,<br>
etc.); mixing the resultant solution with an organic liquid electrolyte; and removing the<br>
organic solvent. Thus, the method includes complicated processing steps. However,<br>
according to the present invention, the method for manufacturing an electrochromic<br>
device comprises simplified processing steps, because it includes a step of mixing an<br>
ionic liquid with a monomer at a predetermined ratio and a step of carrying out in-situ<br>
polymerization at an adequate temperature to form the gel polymer electrolyte.<br>
[58]	Practically, the electrochromic device using the electrolyte comprising the gel<br>
polymer impregnated with the ionic liquid according to the present invention provides<br>
several advantages as follows.<br>
[59]	1) The gel polymer serves to retain the ionic liquid, and thus solves the problem of<br>
electrolyte leakage and allows thin-film formation and processing into film-shaped<br>
products.<br>
[60]	2) The developing/quenching rate of the electrochromic device is high, because the<br>
ionic liquid gel polymer electrolyte has higher ion concentration compared to con-<br>
ventional organic solvent-based electrolytes.<br>
[61]	3) The response rate of the electrochromic device is comparable to that of an elec-<br>
trochromic device using a liquid electrolyte, because the ionic liquid has a high ion<br>
conductivity of 10" to 10" S/cm. Additionally, the electrochromic device according to<br>
the present invention provides more improved memory effect (see, Examples)<br>
[62]	4) The ionic liquid has a broad electrochemical window, and thus shows a lower<br>
possibility for decomposition of electrolyte compared to organic solvent-based<br>
electrolytes.<br>
[63]	5) It is possible to decrease side reactions in the electrochromic device, because the<br>
device uses a very stable ionic liquid.<br>
[64]	6) There is no need of an organic solvent to form a gel polymer electrolyte due to<br>
excellent fluidity and compatibility of the ionic liquid.<br>
[65]	7) The ionic gel polymer electrolyte has no vapor pressure, and thus is free from<br>
the problem related with evaporation and exhaustion of electrolyte.<br>
[66]	More particularly, because electrochemical reactions result from the movement of<br>
electrons or ions, response rate of an electrochromic device depends on current<br>
strength, ion concentration and ion moving rate.<br>
[67]	Electrochromic devices that experience a change in color by electric charges (for<br><br>
example, electrochromic devices using organic compounds such as viologen or<br>
conductive polymers as electrode materials) provide more improved effects in terms of<br>
response rate, electrolyte stability and residual images after quenching, when using an<br>
electrolyte comprising an ionic liquid compared to a liquid electrolyte in which a<br>
lithium salt is dissolved. This results from the reason related with the concentration of<br>
ions dissolved in the electrolyte. Particularly, a liquid electrolyte comprising a lithium<br>
salt shows a salt concentration of 0.1M-1M. However, an ionic liquid shows a higher<br>
concentration of about 5M (apparent density: 1.2 g/ml, molecular weight: 250 g/mol).<br>
[68]	Additionally, performances of electrochromic devices that experience color<br>
developing/quenching due to lithium or hydrogen (for example, electrochromic devices<br>
using inorganic metal oxides such as WO , NiO, Ir(OH), MoO , V O , TiO , etc.) are<br>
affected by ion conductivity as well as ion concentration in the electrolyte. In general,<br>
ion conductivity is measured by the movement of ions moving in the electrolyte<br>
solution. In this regard, viscosity of the solution and ion concentration in the solution<br>
affect the ion conductivity. When the viscosity of the solution decreases, ions can<br>
move more freely and thus ion conductivity increases. When the concentration of ions<br>
in the solution increases, the amount of ions increases and thus ion conductivity also<br>
increases. Conventional liquid electrolytes have low viscosity and thus show an ion<br>
conductivity of 10-2 to 10-4 S/cm, while the gel polymer electrolyte impregnated with<br>
the ionic liquid according to the present invention shows an ion conductivity of 10- to<br>
10-6 S/cm.<br>
Mode for Invention<br>
[69]	Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention. It is to be understood that the following examples are illustrative only and<br>
the present invention is not limited thereto.<br>
[70]	[Examples 1-71<br>
[71]	Example 1. Manufacture of electrochromic device<br>
[72]	1-1. Manufacture of electrochromic device free from electrolyte<br>
[73]	A working electrode was manufactured by forming a thin film of WO on ITO<br>
glass (Samsung Corning Co.) as a transparent electrode through a sputtering process to<br>
a thickness of 150 nm. A counter electrode provided with a thin film of NiO having a<br>
thickness of 150 nm was also manufactured in the same manner as described above.<br>
The working electrode and the counter electrode were sealed together along their edges<br>
except a portion by using a sealant containing a glass ball spacer, as shown in FIG.1, to<br>
provide an electrochromic device free from electrolyte.<br>
[74]	1-2. Manufacture of electrochromic device comprising ionic liquid gel polymer as<br>
electrolyte<br>
[75]	Prepared was an electrolyte containing 1M LiClO4 as a lithium salt and further<br><br>
including a mixture formed of [EMIM][BF ] as ionic liquid (wherein EMIM represents<br>
ethyl methyl imidazolium), HEMA (2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) as vinyl monomer<br>
and AMVN (azo-bis-dimethylvaleronitrile) as thermal initiator in the weight ratio of<br>
8:2:0.01. The electrolyte was injected into the electrochromic device having inorganic<br>
metal oxide, WO3 /NiO, electrodes obtained as described in Example 1-1. Next, the<br>
inlet for injecting the electrolyte was sealed by using a UV sealant and then poly-<br>
merization was carried out at an adequate temperature of 55 °C for 1 hour to form a gel<br>
polymer electrolyte.<br>
[76]	The ion conductivity of the resultant gel polymer electrolyte was about 10"3 S/cm at<br>
room temperature. A slightly opaque gel polymer was formed by the thermal poly-<br>
merization. The electrochromic device using the opaque gel polymer electrolyte<br>
developed a blue color and showed a transmission of 29%. Upon quenching, the elec-<br>
trochromic device was slightly opaque and showed a transmission of 55%.<br>
[77]	Additionally, because the electrochromic device used the above gel polymer<br>
electrolyte, it did not cause any performance problems resulting from electrolyte<br>
leakage and evaporation, and provided excellent memory effect over 72 hours or more.<br>
[78]	Example 2<br>
[79]	Example 1 was repeated to provide an electrochromic device comprising an ionic<br>
liquid gel polymer electrolyte, except that [BMIM][TFSI] (wherein BMIM represents<br>
butylmethyl imidazolium and TFSI represents bis(trifluoromethanesurfonyl)imide) was<br>
used as ionic liquid instead of [EMIM][BF ]. Similarly to Example 1, a slightly opaque<br>
gel polymer was formed by the polymerization. The ion conductivity of the resultant<br>
gel polymer electrolyte was about 0.5~3 X 10-3 S/cm.<br>
[80]	The finished electrochromic device developed a dark blue color and showed a<br>
transmission of 29%. Upon quenching, the electrochromic device was transparent and<br>
showed a transmission of 57%. As mentioned in Example 1, the electrochromic device<br>
provided excellent memory effect over 72 hours or more.<br>
[81]	Example 3<br>
[82]	Example 1 was repeated to provide an electrochromic device comprising an ionic<br>
liquid gel polymer electrolyte, except that [BMrM][Triflate] was used as ionic liquid<br>
instead of [EMM] [BF ].<br>
[83]	Contrary to Example 1 and Example 2 using [EMIM][BF4] and [BMIM][TFSI] as<br>
ionic liquid, respectively, a very transparent gel polymer was formed. The ion con-<br>
ductivity of the resultant gel polymer electrolyte was about 0.5~3 X 10 S/cm.<br>
[84]	The finished electrochromic device developed a dark blue color and showed a<br>
transmission of 31%. Upon quenching, the electrochromic device was transparent and<br>
showed a transmission of 78%. As mentioned in Example 1, the electrochromic device<br>
provided excellent memory effect over 72 hours or more.<br><br>
[85]	Example 4<br>
[86]	Example 1 was repeated to provide an electrochromic device comprising an ionic<br>
liquid gel polymer electrolyte, except that MMA (methyl methacrylate) was used as<br>
vinyl monomer instead of HEMA.<br>
[87]	Similarly to Example 1 using HEMA as vinyl monomer, a slightly opaque gel<br>
polymer electrolyte was formed by the polymerization. The electrochromic device<br>
using the above electrolyte developed a dark blue color and showed a transmission of<br>
28%. Upon quenching, the electrochromic device was transparent and showed a<br>
transmission of 53%. As mentioned in Example 1, the electrochromic device provided<br>
excellent memory effect over 72 hours or more.<br>
[88]	Example 5<br>
[89]	Example 1 was repeated to provide an electrochromic device comprising an ionic<br>
liquid gel polymer electrolyte, except that [BMIM][TFSI] was used as ionic liquid<br>
instead of [EMIM][BF4] and that MMA was used as vinyl monomer instead of HEMA.<br>
[90]	Similarly to Example 2 using HEMA as vinyl monomer, a slightly opaque gel<br>
polymer electrolyte was formed by the polymerization. The electrochromic device<br>
using the above electrolyte developed a dark blue color and showed a transmission of<br>
30%. Upon quenching, the electrochromic device was transparent and showed a<br>
transmission of 55%. As mentioned in Example 1, the electrochromic device provided<br>
excellent memory effect over 72 hours or more.<br>
[911	Example 6<br>
[92]	A working electrode was manufactured by coating PEDOT<br>
(poly-3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) as electrode material on ITO glass through an<br>
electro-polymerization process to a thickness of about 150 nm. A counter electrode<br>
was manufactured by coating PAN (polyacrylonitrile) to a thickness of about 150 nm<br>
in the same manner as described above. An electrochromic device free from electrolyte<br>
was provided by using the above electrodes in the same manner as described in<br>
Example 1-1. Then, an electrochromic device comprising an ionic liquid gel polymer<br>
as electrolyte was manufactured in the same manner as described in Example 1-2.<br>
[93]	The electrochromic device manufactured by using the above electrolyte developed<br>
a dark blue color and showed a transmission of 18%. Upon quenching, the elec-<br>
trochromic device was transparent and showed a transmission of 43%. Additionally,<br>
the electrochromic device provided excellent memory effect over 24 hours or more.<br>
[94]	Example 7<br>
[95]	Example 1 was repeated to provide an electrochromic device comprising an ionic<br>
liquid gel polymer electrolyte, except that [BMIM][TFSI] was used as ionic liquid<br>
instead of [EMIM][BF ] and that the electrochromic device free from electrolyte was<br>
manufactured in the same manner as described in Example 6.<br><br>
[9,6]	The electrochromic device manufactured by using the above electrolyte developed<br>
a dark blue color and showed a transmission of 16%. Upon quenching, the elec-<br>
trochromic device was transparent and showed a transmission of 47%. Additionally,<br>
the electrochromic device provided excellent memory effect over 24 hours or more.<br>
[97]	[Comparative Examples 1-2]<br>
[98]	Comparative Example 1<br>
[99]	An electrochromic device free from electrolyte was manufactured in the same<br>
manner as described in Example 1-1. Then, the electrochromic device was finished by<br>
using GBL (γ -butyrolactone) containing 1M LiClO4 as liquid electrolyte.<br>
[100]	The finished electrochromic device developed a dark blue color and showed a<br>
transmission of 34%. Upon quenching, the electrochromic device was transparent and<br>
showed a transmission of 76%. In other words, the performance of the electrochromic<br>
device was comparable to that of an electrochromic device comprising gel polymer<br>
electrolyte that was transparent when prepared by polymerization. However, because<br>
the electrochromic device used a liquid electrolyte, it caused a problem related with<br>
electrolyte leakage. Additionally, it was not possible to use flexible plastic substrates.<br>
There was a great possibility for side reactions between the organic electrolyte and<br>
electrodes when used for a long time. Moreover, the electrochromic device showed<br>
memory effect over about 12 hours, which was poor compared to an electrochromic<br>
device using a gel polymer electrolyte.<br>
[101]	Comparative Example 2<br>
[102]	An electrochromic device free from electrolyte was manufactured in the same<br>
manner as described in Example 1-1. Then, the electrochromic device was finished by<br>
using [EMIM][BF ] containing 1M LiClO4 as liquid electrolyte.<br>
[103]	The finished electrochromic device developed a dark blue color and showed a<br>
transmission of 32%. Upon quenching, the electrochromic device was transparent and<br>
showed a transmission of 78%. In other words, the quality of the electrochromic device<br>
was comparable to that of an electrochromic device comprising gel polymer electrolyte<br>
that was transparent when prepared by polymerization. However, because the elec-<br>
trochromic device used a liquid electrolyte, it caused a problem related with electrolyte<br>
leakage. Additionally, it was not possible to use flexible plastic substrates. Moreover,<br>
the electrochromic device showed memory effect over about 12 hours, which was poor<br>
compared to an electrochromic device using a gel polymer electrolyte.<br>
[104]	Experimental Example 1. Evaluation of reflectance of electrochromic device<br>
[105]	Reflectance of each electrochromic device comprising an ionic liquid gel polymer<br>
electrolyte according to the present invention was measured as follows.<br>
[106]	Each electrochromic device according to Example 1 and Example 7 was measured<br>
for reflectance. The electrochromic devices according to Example 1 (see, FIG. 2) and<br><br>
Example 7 (see, FIG. 3) showed a reflectance of about 10-30%, upon color developing,<br>
and a reflectance of about 35-50% upon quenching.<br>
[107]	Particularly, the electrochromic device using inorganic metal oxide, WO3/NiO,<br>
electrodes according to Example 1 showed a response rate of a few seconds to several<br>
tens seconds in color developing and quenching (cell size: 5X5 cm). This indicates that<br>
the electrochromic device realizes color developing and quenching as electrochromic<br>
device. Compared to this, the electrochromic device using conductive polymer,<br>
PEDOT/PAN, as electrodes according to Example 7 showed a response rate of a few<br>
seconds in color developing and quenching (cell size: 5X5 cm), which was sig-<br>
nificantly higher than the response rate of the electrochromic device using inorganic<br>
metal oxide. This indicates that the gel polymer electrolyte using an ionic liquid can<br>
also realize color developing and quenching when using conductive polymer<br>
electrodes.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
[108]	As can be seen from the foregoing, the electrochromic device according to the<br>
present invention uses a gel polymer electrolyte comprising an ionic liquid. Therefore,<br>
there is no problem related with electrolyte leakage. Additionally, it is possible to<br>
manufacture electrochromic devices by using plastic materials, because the ionic liquid<br>
gel polymer electrolyte according to the present invention permits structural de-<br>
formation with ease. Further, because the electrochromic device according to the<br>
present invention uses an ionic liquid, it is possible to minimize side reactions between<br>
constitutional elements of an electrochromic device and electrolyte.<br>
