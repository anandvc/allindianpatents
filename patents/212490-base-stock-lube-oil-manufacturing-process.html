BASE STOCK LUBE OIL   PROCESS<br>
FIELD OF  INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to a catalytic process for producing a lubricating oil base stock.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Crude petroleum is distilled and fractionated into many products such as gasoline, kerosene, jet field, aspartames, and the like. One portion of the crude petroleum forms the base of lubricating oil base stocks used in, inter alias, the lubricating of internal combustion engines.<br>
The manufacture of lubricating base oils from crude petroleufn oil is typically a multi-step process, though there are many variations in the specifics of the processing steps, throughout the industry. Each lube manufacturing facility may include one or more of an upgrading step to remove heteroatoms and to increase the viscosity index of the final lube oil product, a dew axing step to remove undesirable wax from the oil, and a finishing step to stabilize the oil to oxidation and thermal degradation. However, lube oil users are demanding every increasing base oil quality, and refiners are finding that their available equipment is becoming less and less able to produce base stocks which meet these product specifications. New processes are required to provide refiners with the tools for preparing the modem base oils using existing equipment at lower cost and with safer operation.<br>
Bayle, et al., in U.S. Patent No. 4.622,129, discloses a method of solvent extraction followed by hydrotreating to produce consistently high quality lube oils. In the '129 method, a formula relating to lube oil properties and hydrotreating conditions is proposed for adjusting the extraction depth of the base oils to be hydroprocessed.<br>
Dun, et al. in U.S. Patent No. 3,663,422, discloses a process for producing very high-viscosity-index lubricating oils by hydrotreating a solvent-refined asphalt-free waxy hydrocarbon oil in the presence of a sulfided catalyst comprising a Group VI and/or Group VIII metal supported on a substantially non-acidic refractory oxide base. The hydrotreating conditions in '422 include a temperature in the range of from 420 to 460*’0 and a pressure of from 165 to 225 kg/cm’. In the '422 process, the hydrotreating step produces a dew axed oil having a viscosity index of at least 125 and a viscosity at<br><br>
210°F (99°C) of at least 9 centistokes.<br>
Miller, in U.S. Patent No. 5,4 13,695, teaches a process for producing lube oil from a solvent refined gas oil, using an intermediate pore size silicoaluminophosphale molecular sieve and at least one Group VII metal under dewaxing and isocracies conditions.<br>
Sheen, in U.S. Patent No. 4,394,249, discloses a hydrodesulfuiization process for removing from 50 to 99.5% by weight of sulfur in a lube oil feedstock prior to dewaxing the feedstock in a distillate dewaxing process unit.  In the process, a lube oil feedstock is hydrodesulfurized and the effluent separated into a gaseous fraction and a liquid fraction. The liquid fraction is contacted in a catalytic dewaxing unit with a highly siliceous zeolite ZSM-5 type porous crystalline material, and the effluent conducted to a heat exchanger. The gaseous fraction from the hydrotreater is also conducted to the heat exchanger, heated by exchanging heat with the effluent from the catalytic dewaxing unit and conducted to the catalytic dewaxing unit.<br>
Ackelson, in U.S. Patent No. 4,695,365, discloses a process for hydrotreating and hydrodewaxing a spindle oil in the presence of a catalyst containing at least 70 percent by weight of an intermediate pore molecule sieve in a support.  In the preferred process of *365, substantial amounts of sulfur and nitrogen are removed during the process, but the viscosity of the spindle oil remains largely unchanged. Thus, the viscosity of the spindle oil, measured at 100°C, differs from the feed entering the hydrotreating stage by no more than 1.75 centistokes.<br>
Woodle, in U.S. Patent No. 3,779,896, teaches a preparation of lubricating oil comprising simultaneous deasphalting-solvent refining of a residuum containing petroleum fraction, and hydrocracking the affinity phase with a hydrocracking catalyst at a temperature between 600° and 900°F. (316°C and 482°C), a pressure between 800 and 5,000 psig (5.6 - 34.6 MPa), a space velocity between I.O and 5.0 v/v/hr. and a hydrogen rate between 500 and 20,000 (i.e., standard cubic feet per barrel) (89.1 " 3600 'oil).<br>
API Publication 1509: Engine Oil Licensing and Certification System, 'Appendix E-API Base Oil Interchangeability Guidelines for Passenger Car Motor Oil and Diesel engine Oils" describes base stock categories. A Group U base stock contains greater than or equal to 90 percent saturates and less than or equal to 0.03 percent sulfur and<br><br>
has a viscosity index greater than or equal to 80 and less than 120.  A Group HI base stock contains greater than or equal to 90 percent saturates and less than or equal to 0.03 percent sulfur and has a viscosity index greater than or equal to 120.  In order to prepare such high quality oils from straight run petroleum stock conventionally requires very severe operating conditions, including, for example, reaction over a hydrocracking catalyst at a hydrogen pressure generally above 2000 Pisa (13.8 MPa) and a reaction temperature above about 725"*? (385°C), or solvent extraction at high solvent/oil ratios and high extraction temperatures. While effective for preparing the base stocks, these conventional processes are expensive to operate, and yields of base stock are often low. It is desirable to have a process for preparing the Group II and Group III base stocks at lower operating cost, at lower equipment cost and with improved operator safety.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a process for producing a lubricating oil base stock, the process comprising a hydrotreating step, a dewaxing step and a hydrogenation step. Among other factors, the present process is based on the discovery of a surprisingly effective and low cost process for making a lubricating oil base stock. The low cost is realized, in part, by the mild conditions required in the hydrotreating step. In conventional processing, hydrotreating under severe reaction conditions is often required to produce a desired low sulfur, high viscosity index product for dewaxing and stabilizing by hydrogenation. In the present process, a high quality oil, such as a Group II or a Group III oil, is produced using only mild hydrotreating conditions of temperature and pressure. Such mild operating conditions are possible because of the additional benefit achieved with the dewaxing catalyst and the hydrogenation catalyst of the present invention. In particular, a hydrogenation catalyst, comprising a platinum/palladium alloy, has been found to be particularly active for the hydrogenation of a lubricating oil base stock, particularly when the base stock has high levels of sulfur, e.g. greater than 20 ppm sulfur. This resistance to sulfur poisoning permits, in part, the operation of the hydrotreating step at mild conditions, even when a high quality lubricating oil base stock such as a Group 11 or a Group III oil is desired   Such mild conditions result in significantly lower cost of operation of the process relative to conventional processes.<br><br>
Accordingly, a process is provided for producing a lubricating oil base stock comprising:<br>
a)	contacting a petroleum feedstock which has a normal boiling point in the range of about 600°F (316°C) to about 1250°F (677’C) in a hydrotreating reaction zone with a hydrotreating catalyst at a hydrogen partial pressure of less than about 1600 psia (11 MPa) and a temperature between about SOO’F (260°C) and about 800°F (42TC) to produce a hydrotreated oil having a viscosity index which is at least about 5 greater than the viscosity index of the petroleum feedstock and a viscosity measured at look’ C of at least about 2 cSt;<br>
b)	contacting the hydrotreated oil at hydrodewaxing conditions in a dewaxing reaction zone with an intermediate pore size molecular sieve catalyst to produce a dewaxed oil having a pour point lower than the pour point of the hydrotreated oil; and<br>
c)	contacting the dewaxed oil at hydrogenation conditions in a hydrofmishing reaction zone with a hydrogenation catalyst comprising a platinum/palladium alloy to produce a lubricating oil base stock, wherein the platinum/palladium molar ratio of the platinum/palladium alloy is between about 2.5:1 and about 1:2.<br>
Further to the invention is provided a process for producing a lubricating oil comprising upgrading a petroleum feedstock to produce a lube oil feedstock having a viscosity index higher than that of the petroleum feedstock; and reacting the lube oil feedstock at hydrotreating conditions selected to maintain a volumetric cracking conversion during hydrotreating of less than 20%, preferably less than 10%, more preferably less than 5%, and a sulfur content of the hydrotreated oil of less than 50 ppm, preferably less than 20 ppm and more preferably less than 10 ppm, wherein the change in viscosity index of the lube oil feedstock during hydrotreating, (VIH - VIo) is such that (VIH-VIO)/AC is greater than 1.0 and preferably at least about 1.5, wherein VIH is the viscosity index of the hydrotreated oil, VIo is the viscosity index of the lube oil feedstock to the hydrotreater, and AC is the volumetric cracking conversion in the hydrotreater. Both VIo and VIH are on a dewaxed basis.<br><br>
Further to the invention is a lubricating oil base stock containing less than 0.03% sulfur, greater than or equal to 90% saturates and a viscosity index of at least 80, preferably at least 95, which lubricating oil base stock is prepared from a lube oil feedstock containing at least 0.1% sulfur by a process comprising:<br>
a)	hydrotreating a petroleum feedstock having a viscosity index of at least about 75 in a hydrotreating reaction zone with a hydrotreating catalyst at a hydrogen partial pressure of less than about 1600 psig (11.1 MPa) and a temperature between about 500°F (260°C) and about 800’F {42TC) to produce a hydrotreated oil having a viscosity index which is at least about 5 greater than the viscosity index of the petroleum feedstock and a viscosity measured at 100°C of at least about 2 cSt;<br>
b)	contacting the hydrotreated oil at hydrodewaxing conditions with an intermediate pore size molecular sieve catalyst to produce a dewaxed oil having a pour point which is lower than the pour point of the hydrotreated oil; and<br>
c)	contacting the dewaxed oil at hydrogenation conditions in a hydrofinishing reaction zone with a hydrogenation catalyst comprising a platinum/palladium alloy to produce a lubricating oil base stock, wherein the platinum/palladium molar ratio of the platinum/palladium alloy is between about 2.5:1 and about 1:2.<br>
The lubricating oil base stock prepared as described herein preferably meets the requirements of an aforementioned Group II base oil or a Group III base oil.<br>
A surprising aspect of the present invention is that the preferred hydrogenation catalyst, which comprises a platinum/palladium alloy on an silica/alumina support, demonstrates a surprising tolerance to sulfur poisoning, such that a Group II or a Group III lubricating oil base stock may be produced from a high sulfur containing lube oil feedstock using only mild hydrotreating to prepare a hydrotreated effluent for hydrodewaxing. This is a contrast to the conventional process, which requires hydrocracking or solvent extraction at severe conditions in order to prepare an effluent suitable for hydrodewaxing in the preparation of the high quality Group II and Group III base oils.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Feedstocks to the process may be one or a combination of refinery streams having a normal boiling point of at least about 600°F (316°C), although the process is also useful with oils which have initial boiling points as low as 436*’F (224"C). By having a normal boiling point of at least about 600°F (316°C) is meant that about 85% by volume of the feedstock has a boiling point at atmospheric pressure of at least about 600’F (316X). While higher boiling lube oil feedstocks may be processed as disclosed herein, the preferred feedstock will have a boiling range such that at least 85% by volume of the feedstock has a normal boiling point of at most about I250'F (677°C), and more preferably at most about 1100°F (593°C). Representative feedstocks which may be treated using the present process include gas oils and vacuum gas oils (VGO), hydrocracked gas oils and vacuum gas oils, deasphalted oils, slack wax, foots oils, coker tower bottoms fraction, reduced crude, vacuum tower bottoms, deasphalted vacuum resids, FCC tower bottoms and cycle oils and raffinates from a solvent extraction process. The nitrogen, sulfur and saturate contents of these feeds will vary, depending on a number of factors. However, while the sulfur and nitrogen contents of the lube oil feedstock are not critical in the practice of the present invention, the present process is particularly useful for those feeds having high nitrogen and high sulfur contents. Thus feedstocks containing greater than 100 ppm sulfur or 200 ppm sulfur, or 400 ppm sulfur or even in the range of between from about 0.5% to about 2.5% by weight of sulfur may be suitably processed as described herein. The lube oil feedstock will also generally contain more than 50 ppm nitrogen, usually in the range from 50 ppm nitrogen to 2000 ppm (0.2 wt %) nitrogen. The high tolerance of the catalyst system for high feed sulfur levels permits using straight run VGO as a suitable feedstock. The use of such a feed greatly reduces overall processing cost. The preferred feedstock to the present process has a viscosity index of greater than about 75. In one embodiment, the feedstock will be a typical base oil feedstock having a viscosity index in the range of 75 to 90. In a separate embodiment, particularly when the feedstock contains significant amounts of wax, the viscosity index of the feedstock may be higher than 110 or 120 or even 130, For example, a lube oil feedstock such as a vacuum gas oil having a sulfur content of as high as 2.5% by weight and a normal boiling point of as high as I250°F {61VC) may be processed according to the present process to produce a Group II or a Group III<br><br>
lubricating oil base stock.<br>
The feedstock employed in the process of the invention may contain high amounts of wax, e.g. greater than 50% wax   Exemplary feedstocks containing high amount of wax include waxy distillate slicks such as gas oils, lubricating oil stocks, synthetic oils such as those by Fischer-Tropic synthesis, high pour point polyalphaolefins, foots oils, synthetic waxes such as normal alphaoleftn waxes, slack waxes, defiled waxes and microcryslalline waxes.  Foots oil is prepared by separating oil from the wax. The isolated oil is referred to as foots oil.<br>
Slack wax can be obtained from either a hydrocracked lube oil or a solvent refined lube oil.  Slack waxes possess a very high viscosity index, normally in the range of from 140 to 200, depending on the oil content and the starting material from which the wax has been prepared. Slack waxes are therefore eminently suitable for the preparation of lubricating oils having very high viscosity indices, i.e., from about 120 to about 180.<br>
A refinery stream may desirably be treated in a mild solvent extraction process to prepare the lube oil feedstock.  Solvent extraction used for preparing the lube oil feedstock for the present process is conventional, and does not require detailed description. The solvent extraction step is suitably carried out with solvents such as N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone or furfural. The solvents are chosen for their relative solubilization of aromatic-type petroleum molecules and paraffin-type molecules, and for their relatively low boiling point, which permits ease of separation of the solvent from the extract. Solvent extractors, such as the rotating disc contactor, are used widely in preparing lubricating oils. Asphalt-containing feedstocks may be deasphalted prior to solvent extraction. Preferred solvents for deasphalting include lower-boiling paraffin hydrocarbons such as ethane, propane, butane, pentane, or mixtures thereof Propane deasphalting is preferred. Pentane is the most suitable solvent if high yields of deasphalted oil are desired. These lower-boiling parasitic solvents may also be used as mixtures with alcohols such as methanol and isopropanol.<br>
In conventional processes for preparing high quality lubricating oil base stocks, a solvent extraction process is often employed to upgrade a petroleum feedstock, such that sulfur, nitrogen and aromatic compounds are removed and the viscosity index of the extracted oil is increased relative to the extractor feedstock   The conventional solvent extraction severity is typically maintained at sufficient conditions to product an extracted<br><br>
oil product having a viscosity index of at least 80, and preferably at least 95, if a Group II oil is desired   If a Group III oil is desired, the extraction severity is sufficient to produce an extracted oil product having a viscosity index of at least 120.<br>
A solvent extraction process for the preparation of a lube oil feedstock useful in the present method may be run at lower severity than is commonly employed in the preparation of high quality lubricating oil base stocks. Reduced solvent extraction severity is seen in reduced solvent usage and/or in reduced solvent extraction temperatures.  Decreasing the amount of solvent required for the solvent extraction step results in higher yields in the extraction step, and simplifies the process for separating the solvent from the extract following the extraction step.<br>
In the embodiment of the present process which includes a preliminary solvent extraction step, solvent extraction conditions may be maintained to produce an extracted oil product having a viscosity index which is at least 5 less, and preferably in the range of about 5 to about 20 less than the desired viscosity index of the lubricating oil base stock prepared in the present process. If the desired viscosity index of the Group II lubricating oil base stock is 80, the solvent extraction pre-treatment step of the present process is maintained to produce a lubricating oil feedstock having a viscosity index of less than about 75 and preferably in the range from about 60 to about 75.  Likewise, if the desired viscosity index of the Group II lubricating oil base stock is 95, the solvent extraction pre-treatment step of the present process is maintained to produce a lubricating oil feedstock having a viscosity index of less than about 90 and preferably in the range from about 75 to about 90. Likewise, if the desired viscosity index of the Group III lubricating oil base stock, for example, is 120, the solvent extraction pre-treatment step of the present process is maintained to produce a lubricating oil feedstock having a viscosity index of less than about 115 and preferably in the range from about 100 to about 115.<br>
The hydrotreating catalyst for the low severity hydiotreating process within the hydrotreating reaction zone contains one or a combination of hydrogenation metals on an oxide support material. Hydrogenation metals selected from Group VIA and Group VIllA of the Periodic Table (lUPAC form), such as one or a mixture of nickel, tungsten, cobalt, molybdenum, platinum or palladium, are preferred. The hydrogenation metal(s) may be either in elemental form or in combination with other elements (eg sulfur, oxygen, halogen, nitrogen) on an oxide support material   If a combination of at least a<br><br>
Group VIA and a Group VIllA metal component is present as (mixed) oxides, it will be subjected to a suspiring treatment prior to proper use in hydrotreating.  Suitably, the catalyst compositions to be used in the process according to the present invention comprise pen or more components of nickel and/or cobalt and one or more components of molybdenum and/or tungsten or one or more components of platinum and/or palladium.<br>
The amount(s) of hydrogenation component(s) in the catalyst compositions suitably range from about 0.5% to about 10% by weight of Group VIIIA metal component(s) and from about 5% to about 25% by weight of Group VIA metal component(s), calculated as metal(s) per 100 parts by weight of total catalyst. The preferred catalyst compositions in accordance with the present invention comprise about 3%-10% by weight of nickel and from about 5%-20% by weight molybdenum. More preferably, the catalyst compositions in accordance with the present invention comprise from about 4%-8% by weight of nickel and from about 8%-15% by weight molybdenum, calculated as metals per 100 parts by weight of total catalyst.<br>
Catalysts useful as hydrotreating catalysts of the present invention may be prepared in a process comprising mixing or comulling active sources of the hydrogenation metals with active sources of the oxide’upport material. Other components of the catalyst may also be added before or during mixing. The mixed components may then be shaped, e.g. by extrusion, and the shaped catalyst precursor heated to form the catalyst. Such methods are well-known in the art.<br>
The hydrotreating catalyst may flirter comprise molecular sieves such as the SAPO's, e.g. SAPO-11, SAPO-5, SAPO-31, SAPO-41. faujasite-type zeolites such as Y, X, A, ultrastable Y, other zeolites such as Beta and intermediate pore zeolites such as ZSM-5, SSZ-32, ZSM-23, ZSM-25. If crystalline materials are included in the hydrotreating catalyst, low-activity, low-acid forms of the crystalline materials are preferred. When such a crystalline material is present in the hydrotreating catalyst, the<br><br>
catalyst will generally contain less than 10% of the crystalline material, and preferably less than 8%. For example, a suitable hydrotreating catalyst contains a Y-type zeolite having a unit cell size less than about 24.50 angstroms and preferably less than about 24.35 angstroms, a bulk silica to alumina mole ratio of greater than 5, preferably greater than about 25, and an alkali(ne earth) metal content of less than 0.3 percent by weight basis metal<br><br>
The oxide support material will include one or more of silica, alumina, magnesia' titanic, zirconia, silica-alumina or combinations thereof Both amorphous and crystalline binders can be applied. Preference is given to the use of alumina as the oxide support material.<br>
The process of the present invention is characterized by low severity hydrotreating conditions, with little, if any, conversion of the lube oil feedstock to low boiling hydrotreated products. Hydrotreating conditions are selected to maintain the volumetric cracking conversion during hydrotreating to less than 20%, preferably less than 10% and more preferably less than 5%. As used herein, the volumetric cracking conversion is a measure, in volume percent, of the lube oil feedstock which is converted during hydrotreating into reaction products having a normal boiling point less than a f eforeDt'e Ipinpcrnlnre T,rr. wherein<br>
Tref = T50 - 2.5(T50 - T30),<br>
and wherein T50 and T30 are equal to the normal boiling point temperature of 50% and 30% by volume, respectively, according to a D2887 simulated distillation, of the lube oil feedstock to the hydrotreater. Thus, the hydrotreating reaction zone whirly contains the hydrotreating catalyst of this invention is maintained at a hydrogen partial pressure of less than about 1600 psia (11 MPa), preferably less than about 1250 psig (8.7 MPa) and more preferably less than about 1100 psia (7.6 MPa), and at a temperature between about 500°F (260°C) and about 800°F (427°C) , preferably between about 600°F (316*'C) and about 700°F (37rC). The feed rate is suitably maintained within the range of between about 0.1 hf' and about 10 hf' LHSV, and preferably between about 0.1 hr' ‘ and about 5 hf\ wherein the term LHSV (i.e. liquid hourly space velocity) represents the rate at which the feed is introduced to the reaction zone, in this case the hydrotreating reaction zone. The units of LHSV are in volume of feed per volume of catalyst per hour, or hr'V   In order to maintain sufficient hydrogen in contact with the hydrotreating catalyst during the hydrotreating reactions, a hydrogen stream, generally containing greater than 50 mole percent hydrogen is introduced into ‘the hydrotreating reaction zone at a rate of at least 1000 SCF’arrel of petroleum feedstock (178.1 std m'‘ Hj/m’ oil).<br>
During hydrotreating according to the present invention, the viscosity index of the hydrotreated oil is increased significantly, with relatively little yield loss. For<br><br>
example, in conventional hydrocracking for increasing the viscosity index of a lube base ' oil feedstock, the viscosity index of the product generally increases by less than about 1 viscosity index unit for each 1% in conversion. In contrast, the hydrotreated oil of the present invention has a viscosity index of at least VIH, wherein<br>
 5<br>
.<br><br>
Thus, during hydrotreating according to the present process, the viscosity index of the petroleum feedstock is increased by at least 5 viscosity index units, and preferably increased by between about 5 and about 25 viscosity inlet units, wherein the viscosity index of the petroleum feedstocks and of the hydrotreated oil are on a dewaxed basis.<br>
As used herein, the derivation of viscosity index is described in ASTM D2270-86. The viscosity index is based on measured viscosities at 40°C and at 100*’C. The viscosity index of oils containing sufficient wax to render the measurement of a viscosity at 40°C difficult or impossible may be detuned by an extrapolation method, such as by measuring the viscosity of the oil at two temperatures at which the oil is fluid, e.g. 70°C and lOO’C, with the viscosity at 40*’0 being estimated by using an extrapolation procedure, such as the one described in ASTM D341-89.<br>
Unless otherwise specified, the viscosity index as used herein is on a dewaxed basis. Oils having a pour point of greater than about 0°C were solvent dewaxed prior to the viscosity index determination. A solvent dewaxing procedure suitable for determining viscosity index (dewaxed basis) is as follows: 300 grams of a waxy oil for which a viscosity index (dewaxed basis) was to be determined was diluted 50/50 by volume with a 4:1 mixture of methyl ethyl ketene and toluene which had been cooled to<br><br>
-20°C. The mixture was cooled at -IS’'C, preferably overnight, and then filtered through a Coors funnel at -15 °C using Whitman No. 3 filter paper. The wax was removed from the filter and placed in a tarred 2 liter flask. The solvent was then removed on a hot plate and the wax weighed   The viscosities of the dcwaxcd oil, measured at 40*C and lOO’C, were used to determine the viscosity index.<br>
The sulfur content and the nitrogen content of the hydrotreated oil is reduced relative to those of the lube oil feedstock, and the viscosity index of the hydrotreated oil is increased relative to that of the lube oil feedstock.  In general, the hydrotreated oil will contain less than about 100 ppm sulfur, and preferably less than 50 ppm sulfur and more preferably less than 20 ppm sulfur. Thus, the hydrotreated oil preferably has a sulfijr content which is less than 50% and more preferably less than 25% of the sulfijr content of the lube oil feedstock, i.e. the feedstock to the hydrotreater. It will farther contain less than about 50 ppm nitrogen, and preferably less than about 25 ppm nitrogen.<br>
The effluent from the hydrotreating step typically contains a gaseous portion comprising hydrogen and light hydrocarbon reactor products, and lesser amounts of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide, and a liquid portion of hydrotreated oil, comprising reacted and unreacted hydrocarbonaceous products.  Several options are available for dewaxing the hydrotreated oil, including (a) contacting the entire effluent in a dewaxing zone, with or without added hydrogen, with dewaxing catalyst; (b) separating the liquid and gaseous components, and contacting the liquid components with fresh hydrogen in a dewaxing zone; and (c) separating the liquid and gaseous components, removing contaminants from the gaseous portion, adding fresh hydrogen if needed to the purified gaseous portion, and contacting the resultant gaseous stream containing fresh hydrogen with the liquid portion in the dewaxing zone.<br>
In the present process, at least a portion, and preferably the entire liquid portion, of the effluent from the hydrotreating step is contacted with a hydrodewaxing catalyst to reduce the pour point of the hydrotreated oil. The dewaxing reaction zone will typically be operated at a catalyst temperature of from about 400°F (204°C) to about 900°F (482°C), preferably within the temperature range of from about 550°F (288°C) to about 750’F (399°C). The reactor pressure will usually be within the range of from about 50 to about 3000 psig (0.45-20.8 MPa), preferably within the range of from about 500 to about 2500 psig (3.55-17.3 MPa). The liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) will usually<br><br>
and still more preferably less than about -5°C.<br>
The addition of hydrogen into the dewaxing units, while not essential, is preferred. When hydrogen is used it is generally added in the range of from about 500 to about 10,000 standard cubic feel per barrel folic (SC:i7B) (S9 1-I7K0 std \\\   \\il\\oil), preferably within the range of from about 1000 to about 5000 SCF/B (178-891 std m’ H2/m'‘ oil). The preferred hydrogen feed to the dewaxing units will be substantially free of sulfur compounds, i.e. containing less than 250 ppm His. At least a portion of the hydrogen feed to the dewaxer unit may contain a portion of the gaseous effluent recovered from the hydrotreating unit, which has been treated, e.g. by scrubbing with an aqueous amine solution, to remove a substantial portion of the H2S contained therein.<br>
The dewaxing catalyst comprises an intermediate pore size molecular sieve. There are a number of catalysts which may be useful for the dewaxing step. Examples of intermediate pore size silicaceous crystalline molecular sieves include zeolites such as members of the ZSM family, e.g., ZSM-5, ZSM-11, ZSM-12, ZSM-21, ZSM-23, ZSM-35, ZSM-38 and SSZ-32. ZSM-5 is described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,700,585, 3,702,886 and 3,770,614; ZSM-11 is described in U.S. Patent No. 3,709,979; ZSM-12 is described in U.S. Patent No. 3,832,449; ZSM-21 and ZSM-38 are described in U.S. Patent No. 3,948,758; ZSM-23 is described in U.S. Patent No. 4.076,842; and ZSM-35 is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,016,245. Dewaxing processes using'SSZ-32 are described in, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,053,373; 5,252,527; 5,300,210; 5,397.454; 5,376,260, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.<br>
Isomerization catalysts useful in the present invention also include non-zeolitic<br>
molecular sieves having intermediate size pores. Non-zeolitic molecular sieves are<br>
microporous compositions that are formed from AIO2 and PO2 tetrahedra and have electrovalently neutral frameworks. See U.S. Patent No. 4,861,743<br>
Non-zeolitic molecular sieves include aluminophosphates (AIPO4) as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,310,440, silicoaluminophosphates (SAPO),<br><br>
metalloaluminophosphates (MeAPO), and nonmetal substituted aluminophosphates (ElAPO). Metalloaluminophosphate molecular sieves that may be useful as isomerization catalysts are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,500,65 1; 4,567,029; 4,544,143; and 4,686,093.  Nonmetal substituted aluminophosphates are described in U.S. Patent NOA4,973,785.  Preferably the isomerization catalyst will contain an intermediate pore silicoaluminophosphate or SAPO as the non-zeolitic molecular sieve component. Intermediate pore SAPO's which are particularly useful in canning out the present invention include SAPO-11, SAP0-31,and SAPO-41.  U.S. Patent No. 4,440,871 describes SAPO's generally and SAPO-1 1, SAPO-3 1, and SAPO-41 specifically. The relevant parts of U.S. Patent No. 4,440,871 relating to intermediate pore SAPO's are herein incorporated by reference. Dewaxing processes using the one or more of the SAPO family of molecular sieves as dewaxing/isomerization catalysts are disclosed in, for example, U.S. Patent No. 49215945; 5,282,958; 5,413,695; 5,246,566; the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. While the intermediate pore size silicoaluminate zeolites, such as the ZSM family, dewax by a different mechanism than do the silicoaluminophosphate molecular sieves, both are useful for the present invention.<br>
The preferred intermediate pore isomerization silicoaluminophosphate molecular sieve present in the isomerization catalyst is SAPO-11. When combined with a hydrogenation component, SAPO-11 converts the waxy components to produce a lubricating oil having excellent yield, very low pour point, low cloud point, low viscosity and high viscosity index. The hydrogenation component of the isomerization catalyst will be a Group VIIIA metal, metal compound or combination of Group VIIIA metals or metal compounds. Most preferably, the hydrogenation component will include either platinum or palladium or a combination of these metals or their compounds. The hydrogenation components are added to the catalyst by methods well known to those skilled in the art, such as by impregnation or the like. The metals are typically added to the catalyst as a soluble compound by impregnation after which the impregnated catalyst is air dried and claimed. The most preferred intermediate pore SAPO for use in the present invention is SM-3 which has a crystalline structure falling within that of the SAPO-11 molecular sieves. The preparation of SM-3 and its unique characteristics are described in U.S. Patent 5 J 58,665 which is herein incorporated by reference.<br><br>
The phrase "intermediate pore size" when referring to the zeolites or the SAJ’O's used in carrying out the present invention means an elective pore aperture m the range from about 5.3 to about 6.5 angstroms when the porous inorganic oxide is in the calcined form. Molecular sieves, including zeolites and SAPO's, in this range tend to have unique molecular sieving characteristics. Unlike small pore zeolites such as erionite and chabazite, they will allow hydrocarbons having some branching into the molecular sieve void spaces. Unlike larger pore zeolites such as faujasites and mordenites, they can differentiate between n-alkanes and slightly branched alkanes, and larger branched alkanes having, for example, quaternary carbon atoms.<br>
The effective pore size of the molecular sieves can be measured using standard<br>
adsorption techniques and hydrocarbonaceous compounds of known minimum kinetic<br>
diameters. See Breck, Zeolite Molecular Sieves, 1974 (especially Chapter 8); Anderson,<br>
et al.. J. Catalysis 58, 114 (1979); and U.S. Patent 4, 440,871, the pertinent portions of<br>
which are herein incorporated by reference.	.’<br>
In preparing catalysts for use in the present invention, the intermediate pore aluminosilicate zeolites and intermediate pore SAPO's may be used without additional forming, but usually the zeolite and SAPO's are composite with other materials<br>
resistant to the temperatures and other conditions employed in hydrocarbon conversion<br><br>
processes. Such oxide support materials may include active and inactive materials and<br>
synthetic or naturally occurring zeolites as well as alumina, clays, silica, and metal<br>
oxides. The latter may occur naturally or may be in the form of gelatinous precipitates,<br>
sols, or gels, including mixtures of silica or alumina oxides. Use of other active<br>
materials in association with the intermediate pore zeolite or intermediate pore SAPO<br>
may be present to improve the conversion or selectivity of the catalyst in certain<br>
hydrocarbon conversion processes. Inactive materials can be used to serve as diluents in<br>
order to control the amount of conversion in a given process. Frequently binders, such<br>
as naturally occurring clays and inorganic oxides, may be present to improve the crush<br>
strength of the catalyst.	In addition to the foregoing materials, the intermediate pore zeolite or intermediate pore SAPO may be composite with a porous oxide support material such as aluminum phosphate, silica-alumina, silica-magnesia, silica-zirconia, silica-thoria, silica-beryllia, silica-titania as well as tertiary compositions such as silica-alumina-thoria, silica-alumina-zirconia, silica-alumina-magnesia, and silica-magnesia-zirconia. The<br><br>
relative proportions of finely ground intermediate pore zeolite or   pore SAPO to the support material varies widely, generally the crystal will fall within the range of 1 to 90% by weight of the catalyst. The methods for preparing the catalyst compositions are well known to those skilled in the art and include such conventional techniques as spray drying, extrusion, and the like.<br>
The dewaxed effluent from the hydrodewaxing step comprises a low pour point material, having a pour point of less than about S’'C, preferably less than about 0°C and most preferably less than about -5°C, and having a viscosity, measured at 100°C, of greater than about 2 cSt.<br>
Such low pour point material is suitably reacted in a hydrogenation reaction zone over a hydrogenation catalyst comprising one or more noble metals on an inorganic oxide support. The hydrogenation step is desirable for removing, for example aromatic compounds and at least some of the remaining sulfur and nitrogen compounds, and any other components of the dcwaxcd collect which may be a source ol'inslability in the finished oil.<br><br>
The hydrogenation reaction takes place in the presence of hydrogen, preferably   * at hydrogen pressures in the range of between about 500 psia and 4000 psia (3.4 - 33.8 MPa), more preferably in the range of about 900 psia to about 3000 psia (6.2 - 20.7 MPa). Hydrogenation reaction temperatures are generally within a range of about 400°F (204°C) to about 650°F (343°C). For many mild hydrogenation processes, in order to saturate aromatics and remove color bodies from the oil, hydrogenation reaction temperatures between about 400'F (204°C) and about 500°F (260°C) are suitable. The feed rate to the hydrogenation catalyst system is in the range of from about 0.2 to about 1.5 LHSV, preferably in the range of about 0.2 to about 1.0 LHSV. more preferably in the range of 0.3 to 0.7 LHSV. The hydrogen supply (makeup and recycle) is in the range of from about 500 to about 20,000 standard cubic feet per barrel (89.1 -- 3562.6 std m"‘ Hi/m' oil) of lubricating oil base stock, preferably in the range of from about 2000 to about 20,000 standard cubic feet per barrel (356 -- 3560 std m’ H2W oil). Such a hydrogenation process is disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,162,962 and 5,393,408, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.<br>
In the hydrogenation step the dewaxed oil is contacted with a catalyst comprising one or more noble metals, such as platinum, palladium, rhenium, rhodium, ruthenium or iridium, on an inorganic oxide matrix.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the present hydrogenation catalyst is a macroporous hydrogenation catalyst having a total pore volume greater than about 0.45 cmVg, preferably greater than about 0.55 cmVg, with at least about 1%, and preferably at least about 3%, of the total pore volume being in macropores of diameter of greater than about 1000 angstroms, with the minimum amount of macropore volume preferably being greater than 0.07 cmVg. As used herein, the term "macroporous" refers to a catalyst having a relatively large amount of pore volume, i.e., at least 1% in pores of diameter greater than about 1000 Angstroms, with a minimum macropore volume preferably being greater than 0.07 cmVg.<br>
One such macroporous hydrogenation catalyst which is suitable for the invention is described in U.S. Patent No. 5,393,408, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. A particularity preferred hydrogenation catalyst comprises a platinum/palladium alloy having a platinum/palladium molar ratio of<br><br>
between 2.5:1 and 1:2.5, or between 2:1 and 1:1.5. The preferred inorganic oxide matrix is alumina. This particularly preferred hydrogenation catalyst and its preparation is disclosed in copending U.S. Patent Application entitled Sulfur Resistant Hydroconversion Catalyst and Hydroprocess Of Sulfijr-Containing Lube Feedstock, docket number T-5244A, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.<br>
In addition, the hydrogenation catalyst may contain additional cracking components, to facilitate the hydrogenation process and/or to increase the fouling resistance of the hydrogenation catalyst. Such cracking components may include one or a combination of silica-alumina, titanic, magnesia and a zeolite. Preferred zeolites include Y-type zeolites having a bulk SiO2/AJ203 molar ratio of greater than 12 and a unit cell size of less than 24,5 angstroms, preferably less than about 24.35 angstroms.<br>
