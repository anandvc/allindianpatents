				<td>COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING rLUOniNE GUDOTITUTCD OUTIN3 HELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to compositions having utility in numerous<br>
applications, including particularly refrigeration systems, and to methods<br>
and systems utilizing such compositions. In preferred aspects, the present<br>
invention Is directed to refrigerant compositions comprising at least one<br>
multi-fluorinated olefin of the present invention.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Ffuorocarbon based fluids have found widespread use in many<br>
commercial and industrial applications. For example, fluorocarbon based<br>
fluids are frequently used as a working fluid in systems such as air<br>
conditioning, heat pump and refrigeration applications. The vapor<br>
compression cycle Is one of the most commonly used type methods to<br>
accomplish cooling or heating in a refrigeration system. The vapor<br>
compression cycle usually involves the phase change of the refrigerant<br>
from the liquid to the vapor phase through heat absorption at a relatively<br>
low pressure and then from the vapor to the liquid phase through heat<br>
removal at a relatively low pressure and temperature, compressing the<br>
vapor to a relatively elevated pressure, condensing the vapor to the liquid<br>
phase through heat removal at this relatively elevated pressure and<br>
temperature, and then reducing the pressure to start the cycle over again.<br>
While the primary purpose of refrigeration is to remove heat from an<br>
object or other fluid at a relatively low temperature, the primary purpose of<br>
a heat pump is to add heat at a higher temperature relative to the<br>
environment.<br>
Certain fluorocarbons have been a preferred component in many<br>
heat exchange fluids, such as refrigerants, for many years in many<br>
applications. For, example, fluoroalkanes, such as chlorofluoromefriane<br>
and chtorofluoroethane derivatives, have gained widespread use as<br><br>
refrigerants In applications including air conditioning and heat pump<br>
applications owing to their unique combination of chemical and physical<br>
properties. Many of the refrigerants commonly utilized in vapor<br>
compression systems are either single components fluids or azeotropic<br>
mixtures.<br>
Concern has Increased in recent years about potential damage to<br>
the earth's atmosphere i-4 climate, and certain chlorine-based<br>
compounds have been identfaed as particularly problematic In this regard.<br>
The use of chlorine-containing compositions (such as chlorofluorocarbons<br>
(CFCs), hydrochtorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and the like) as refrigerants in<br>
air-conditioning and refrigeration systems has become disfavored because<br>
of the ozone-depleting properties associated with many of such<br>
compounds. There has thus been an increasing need for new<br>
fluorocarbon and hydrofiuorocarbon compounds and compositions that<br>
offer alternatives for refrigeration and heat pump applications. For<br>
example, it has become desirable to retrofit chlorine-containing<br>
refrigeration systems by replacing chlorine-containing refrigerants with<br>
non-chlorine-containing refrigerant compounds that will not deplete the<br>
ozone layer, such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs).<br>
it Is generally considered important, however, that any potential<br>
substitute refrigerant must also possess those properties present in many<br>
of the most widely used fluids, such as excellent heat transfer properties,<br>
chemical stability, low- or no- toxicity, non-flammabliity and lubricant<br>
compatibility, among others.<br>
Applicants have come to appreciate that lubricant compatibility is of<br>
particular importance in many of applications. More particularly, it Is highly<br>
desirably for refrigeration fluids to be compatible with the lubricant utilized<br>
in the compressor unit, used In most refrigeration systems. Unfortunately,<br>
many non-chiorine-containing refrigeration fluids, including HFCs, are<br>
relatively insoluble and/or immiscible in the types of lubricants used<br>
traditionally with CFCs and HFCs, including, for example, mineral oils,<br><br>
alkyfbenzenes or poly(a!pha-otefins). in order for a refrigeration fluW-<br>
iubrlcant combination to work at a desirable level of efficiently within a<br>
compression refrigeration, air-conditioning and/or heat pump system, the<br>
lubricant should be sufficiently soluble in the refrigeration liquid over a<br>
wide range of operating temperatures. Such solubility lowers the viscosity<br>
of the lubricant and allows It to flow more easily throughout the system. In<br>
the absence of such solubility, lubricants tend to become lodged in the<br>
coils of the evaporator of the refrigeration, air-conditioning or heat pump<br>
system, as well as other parts of the system, and thus reduce the system<br>
efficiency.<br>
With regard to efficiency in use, it is important to note that a loss in<br>
refrigerant thermodynamic performance or energy efficiency may have<br>
secondary environmental impacts through increased fossil fuel usage<br>
arising from an Increased demand for electrical energy.<br>
Furthermore, it is generally considered desirably for CFC refrigerant<br>
substitutes to be effective without major engineering changes to<br>
conventional vapor compression technology currently used with CFC<br>
refrigerants.<br>
Flammabilrty is another important property for many applications.<br>
That is, it is considered either important or essential in many applications,<br>
including particularly in heat transfer applications, to use compositions,<br>
which are non-flammable. Thus, it is frequently beneficial to use in such<br>
compositions compounds, which are nonflammable. As used herein, the<br>
term "nonflammable" refers to compounds or compositions, which are<br>
determined to be nonflammable as determined in accordance with ASTM<br>
standard E-681, dated 2002, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Unfortunately, many HFCs, which might otherwise be desirable for used in<br>
refrigerant compositions are not nonflammable. For example, the<br>
fluoroalkane drfluoroetharte (HFC-1S2a) and the fluoroalkene 1,1,1-<br>
trifluoropropene {HFO-1243zf) are each flammable and therefore not<br>
viable for use in many applications.<br><br>
Higher ffuoroalkenes, that is fluorine-substituted alkenes having at<br>
least flva carbon atoms, have been suggested for use as refrigerants.<br>
U.S. Patent Mo. 4,788,352 - Smutny Is directed to production of<br>
fluoridated Cs to Cs compounds having at least some degree of<br>
unsaturation. The Smutny patent identifies such higher olefins as being<br>
known to have utility as refrigerants, pesticides, dielectric fluids, heat<br>
transfer fluids, solvents, and intermediates In various chemical reactions.<br>
(See column 1, lines 11- 22).<br>
While the fiuorinated olefins described in Smutny may have some<br>
level of effectiveness in heat transfer applications, it is believed that such<br>
compounds may also have certain disadvantages. For example, some of<br>
these compounds may tend to attack substrates, particularly general-<br>
purpose plastics such as acrylic resins and ABS resins. Furthermore, the<br>
higher olefinic compounds described in Smutny may also be undesirable<br>
in certain applications because of the potential level of toxicity of such<br>
compounds which may arise as a result of pesticide activity noted in<br>
Smutny. Also, such compounds may have a boiling point, which is too<br>
high to make them useful as a refrigerant in certain applications.<br>
Bromofluoromethaneand bromochlorofluoromethane derivatives,<br>
particularly bromotrifluoromethane (Halon 1301) and<br>
bromochlorodifluoromethane(Halon 1211) have gained widespread use<br>
as fire extinguishing agents in enclosed areas such as airplane cabins and<br>
computer rooms. However, the use of various halons is being phased out<br>
due to their high ozone depletion. Moreover, as halons are frequently<br>
used in areas where humans are present, suitable replacements must also<br>
be safe to humans at concentrations necessary to suppress or extinguish<br>
fire.<br>
Applicants have thus come to appreciate a need for compositions,<br>
and particularly heat transfer compositions, fire extinguishing/suppression<br>
compositions, blowing agents, solvent compositions, and compatabifeing<br>
agents, that are potentially useful in numerous applications. Including<br><br>
vapor compression heating and cooling systems and methods, while<br>
avoiding one ormore of the disadvantages noted above.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
Applicants have found that the above-noted need, and other needs,<br>
can be satisfied by compositions comprising one or more C3 or C4<br>
fluoroalkenes, preferably compounds having Formula I as follows:<br>
XCFZR^(1)<br>
where X is a C2 or a C3 unsaturated, substituted or unsubstftuted, alkyf<br>
radical, each R is Independently CI, F, Br, I or H, and z is 1 to 3. Highly<br>
preferred among the compounds of Formula I are the cis- and trans-<br>
isorners of 1,3,3,3-tetrafluoropropene (HFO-1234ze)<br>
The present Invention provides also methods and systems which<br>
utilize the compositions of the present invention, including methods and<br>
systems for heat transfer, foam blowing, solvating, flavor and fragrance<br>
extraction and/or delivery, and aerosol generation.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
THE COMPOSITIONS<br>
The present Invention is directed to compositions comprising at<br>
least one fluoroalkene containing from 3 to 4 carbon atoms, preferably<br>
three carbon atoms, and at least one carbon-carbon double bond. The<br>
fluoroalkene compounds of the present invention are sometimes referred<br>
to herein for the purpose of convenience as hydrofluoro-olefins or "HFOs"<br>
if they contain at least one hydrogen. Although it Is contemplated that the<br>
HFOs of the present invention may contain two carbon - carbon double<br>
bonds, such compounds at the present time are not considered to be<br>
preferred.<br>
As mentioned above, the present compositions comprise one or<br>
more compounds in accordance with Formula I. In preferred<br><br>
embodiments, the compoafflons Indude compounds of Formula H below:<br><br>
whereeachRtsfodependentryCt,F, Br, lorH<br>
R*iB(CR2)bY,<br>
YtoCRFj<br>
andnteOoM.<br>
In highly preferred embodiments, Y is CF3, n is 0 and at least one of the<br>
remaining Rs is F.<br>
AppCcants before that, In general, the compounds of the above<br>
identified Formulas I and II are generafly effective and exhfctt udBty ki<br>
refrigerant composiJons, blowing agent compositions, compatJbiftDBrs,<br>
aerosols, propeUants, fragrances, flavor formulations, and solvent<br>
compositions of the present invention. However, appfcants have<br>
surprisingly and unexpectedly found that certain of the compounds having<br>
a structure In accordance with the formulas described above exhtt* a<br>
highry desirable low level of toxicity compared to other of such<br>
compounds. As can be readily appreciated, this discovery is ofpotenttaUy<br>
enormous advantage and benefit for the formulation of not only refrigerant<br>
compositions, but also any and at oomposWona, which would otherwise<br>
contain retatrveiy toxic compounds satisfying the formulas described<br>
above. More partJcubrty, appftcants believe that a relatively tow toxicity<br>
level is associated wflh compounds of Formula II, preferably wherein Y is<br>
CFj, wherein at least one R on the unsaturated terminal carbon is H, and<br>
at least one of the remaining Rs b F. Applicants beBeve abo that al<br>
structural, geometric and stereoisomers of such compounds are-effectJva<br>
and of beneficiaOy low toxicity.<br><br>
In highly preferred embodiments, especially embodiments<br>
comprising the low toxicity compounds described above, n is zero. In<br>
certain highly preferred embodiments the compositions of the present<br>
invention comprise one or more tetrafluoropropenes. The term "HFO-<br>
1234" is used herein to refer to all tetrafluoropropenes. Among the<br>
tetrafluoropropenes, both cis- and trans-1,3,3,3-tetraftuoropropene<br>
(HFO-1234ze) are particularly preferred. The term HFCM234ze is used<br>
herein genetically to refer to 1,3,3,3-tetrafluoropropene, independent of<br>
whether it is the cis- or trans- form. The terms "cfeHFO-1234ze" and<br>
1ransHF01234ze* are used herein to describe the cis- and trans- forms<br>
of 1,3,3,3-tetrafluoropropene respectively. The term "HFO-1234ze"<br>
therefore includes within its scope dsHFO-1234ze, transHFO-1234ze, and<br>
all combinations and mixtures of these.<br>
Although the properties of cfsHFO-1234ze and transHFO-1234ze<br>
differ in at least some respects, it is contemplated that each of these<br>
compounds is adaptable for use, either alone or together with other<br>
compounds including its stereoisomer, in connection with each of the<br>
applications, methods and systems described herein. For example, while<br>
transHFO-1234ze may be preferred for use in certain refrigeration<br>
systems because of its relatively low boiling point (-19° C), ft Is<br>
nevertheless contemplated that cisHFO-1234ze, with a boiling point of<br>
+9* C, also has utility in certain refrigeration systems of the present<br>
invention. Accordingly, it is to be understood that the terms *HFO-1234ze*<br>
and 1,3,3,3-tetrafiuoropropene refer to both stereo isomers, and the use<br>
of this term is intended to indicate that each of the cls-and trans- forms<br>
applies and/or is useful for the stated purpose unless otherwise indicated.<br>
HFO-1234 compounds are known materials and are listed in<br>
Chemical Abstracts databases. The production offluoropropenes such as<br>
CF3CH=CH2 by catalytic vapor phase fluorination of various saturated and<br>
unsaturated halogen-containing C3 compounds is described in U.S. Patent<br>
Nos. 2,889,379; 4,798,818 and 4,465,786, each of which is incorporated<br><br>
herein by reference. EP 974,571, also Incorporated herein by reference,<br>
discloses the preparation of 1,1,1,3-tetrafluoropropene by contacting<br>
1.1,1,3,3-perrtafluoropropane (HFC-245fa) in the vapor phase with a<br>
chromium-based catalyst at elevated temperature, or in the liquid phase<br>
with an alcoholic solution of KOH, NaOH, Ca(OH)2 or MgXOHk In<br>
addition, methods for producing compounds In accordance with the<br>
present Invention are described generally in connection with pending<br>
United States Patent Application entitled "Process for Producing<br>
FJuoropropenes" bearing attorney docket number (H0003789 {26267)),<br>
which is also incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The present compositions, particularly those comprising HFO-<br>
1234ze, are believed to possess properties that are advantageous for a<br>
number of important reasons. For example, applicants believe, based at<br>
least in part on mathematical modeling, that the fluorootefins of the<br>
present invention will not have a substantial negative affect on<br>
atmospheric chemistry, being negligible contributors to ozone depletion in<br>
comparison to some other halogenated species. The preferred<br>
compositions of the present invention thus have the advantage of not<br>
contributing substantially to ozone depletion. The preferred compositions<br>
also do not contribute substantially to global warming compared to many<br>
of the hydrofluoroalkanes presently in use.<br>
In certain preferred forms, compositions of the present invention<br>
have a Global Warming Potential (GWP) of not greater than about 1000,<br>
more preferably not greater than about 500, and even more preferably not<br>
greater than about 150. In certain embodiments, the GWP of the present<br>
compositions is not greater than about 100 and even more preferably not<br>
greater than about 75. As used herein, "GWP" is measured relative to that<br>
of carbon dioxide and over a 100-year time horizon, as defined in The<br>
Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion, 2002, a report of the World<br>
Meteorological Association's Global Ozone Research and Monitoring<br>
Project," which is incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
In certain preferred forms, the present compositions also preferably<br>
have an Ozone Depletion Potential (OOP) of not greater than 0.06, mora<br>
preferably not greater than 0.02 arc! even nxxe preferably about zero. As<br>
used herein, "OOP* is as defined in The Scientific Assessment of Ozone<br>
Depletion. 2002. A report of the World Meteorological Association's Global<br>
Ozone Research and Monitoring. Project," which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
The amount of the Formula I compounds. pertlcUariy HFO-1234,<br>
contained in the present compositions can vary widely, depending the<br>
particular appOcation, and compositions containing more than trace<br>
amounts and less than 100% of the compound are wttNh broad the scope<br>
of the present Invention. Moreover, the compositions of the present<br>
Invention can be azeotroplc azeotrope-lfce or rwn-azeotroplc. In<br>
preferred embodiments, the present compositions comprise HFO-1234,<br>
preferably HFO-1234z», In amounts from about 5% by weight to about<br>
09% by weight, and even more preferably from about 5% to about 95%.<br>
Many addKonal compounds may be included in the present compositions,<br>
and the presence of afl such compounds is within the broad scope of the<br>
Invention. In certain preferred embodiments, the present compositions<br>
include, in addition to HFO-1234ze, one or more of the following:<br>
DffkJoromethane (HFC-32)<br>
PentafTuoroethane (HFC-126)<br>
1,1^-t0trafluoroethane<hfc-134></hfc-134>
1,1.U-Tetrafluoroethane (HFC-134a)<br>
Dffluoroelhane (HFC-152a)<br>
1,1,1 ^,3,3,34taptaflixxopropane (HFC-227ea)<br>
1,1,1,3,3,3-riexafluorcorop8ne (HFC-236«a)<br>
1,1,1,3,3-pentafhx)fopropane<hfc-246fa></hfc-246fa>
1,1.1.3,3-pentaOuc^obutane (HFC-38Smfc)<br>

The relative amount of any of the above noted components, as well as any<br>
additional components which may be included in present compositions,<br>
can vary widely within the general broad scope of the present invention<br>
according to the particular application for the composition, and all such<br>
relative amounts are considered to be within the scope hereof.<br>
HEAT TRANSFER COMPOSITIONS<br>
Although it is contemplated that Hie compositions of the present<br>
invention may include the compounds of the present invention in widely<br>
ranging amounts, it is generally preferred that refrigerant compositions of<br>
the present invention comprise compound(s) in accordance with Formula<br>
I, more preferably In accordance with Formula il, and even more<br>
preferably HFO-1234ze. in an amount tnat is at least about 60% by<br>
weight and even more preferably at least about 70 % by weight, of the<br>
composition. In many embodiments, it is preferred that the heat transfer<br>
compositions of the present invention comprise transHFO-1234ze. In<br>
certain preferred embodiments, the heat transfer compositions of the<br>
present invention comprise a combination of cisHFO-1234ze and<br>
transHF01234ze in a dsrtrans weight ratio of from about 1:99 to about<br>
10:99, more preferably from about 1:99 to about 5:95, and even more<br>
preferably from about 1:99 to about 3:97.<br>
The compositions of the present invention may include other<br>
components for the purpose of enhancing or providing certain functionality<br>
to the composition, or tn some cases to reduce the cost of the<br>
composition. For example, refrigerant compositions according to the<br>
present invention, especially those used in vapor compression systems,<br>
Include a lubricant, generally in amounts of from about 30 to about SO<br>
percent by weight of the composition. Furthermore, the present<br>
compositions may also include a compatibDizar, such as propane, for the<br>
purpose of aiding compatibility and/or solubility of the lubricant Such<br>
cornpatibiiizers, including propane, butanes and pentanes, are preferably<br><br>
present in amounts of from about 0.5 to about 5 percent by weight of the<br>
composition. Combinations of surfactants and sofubilizing agents may<br>
also be added to the present compositions to aid oil solubility, as disclosed<br>
by U.S. Patent No. 6,516,837, the disclosure of which is incorporated by<br>
reference. Commonly used refrigeration lubricants such as Polyol Esters<br>
(POEs) and Poly Alkylene Glycols (PAGs), silicone oil, mineral oil, alkyl<br>
benzenes (ABs) and poly(alpha-olefin) (PAO) that are used in refrigeration<br>
machinery with hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerants may be used with<br>
the refrigerant compositions of the present invention.<br>
Many existing refrigeration systems are currently adapted for use in<br>
connection with existing refrigerants, and the compositions of the present<br>
invention are believed to be adaptable for use in many of such systems,<br>
either with or without system modification. In many applications the<br>
compositions of the present invention may provide an advantage as a<br>
replacement In systems, which are currently based on refrigerants having<br>
a relatively high capacity. Furthermore, in embodiments where it is<br>
desired to use a lower capacity refrigerant composition of the present<br>
invention, for reasons of cost for example, to replace a refrigerant of<br>
higher capacity, such embodiments of the present compositions provide a<br>
potential advantage. Thus, K is preferred in certain embodiments to use<br>
compositions of the present invention, particularly compositions<br>
comprising a substantial proportion of, and in some embodiments<br>
consisting essentially of transHFO-1234ze, as a replacement for existing<br>
refrigerants, such as HFC-134a. In certain applications, the refrigerants of<br>
the present Invention potentially permit the beneficial use of larger<br>
displacement compressors, thereby resulting in better energy efficiency<br>
than other refrigerants, such as HFC-134a. Therefore the refrigerant<br>
compositions of the present invention, particularly compositions<br>
comprising transHFP-1234ze, provide the possibility of achieving a<br>
competitive advantage on an energy basis for refrigerant replacement<br>
applications.<br><br>
It is contemplated that the compositions of the present, including<br>
particularly those comprising HFO-1234ze, also have advantage (either in<br>
original systems or when used as a replacement for refrigerants such as<br>
R-12 and R-500), in chillers typically used in connection with commercial<br>
air conditioning systems. In certain of such embodiments it Is preferred to<br>
including in the present HFO-1234ze compositions from about 0.5 to about<br>
5% of a flammabillty suppressant, such as CF3I.<br>
The present methods, systems and compositions are thus<br>

Aerosol products for industrial, consumer or medical use typically<br>
contain one or more propellants along with one or more active Ingredients,<br>
inert ingredients or solvents. The propellant provides the force that expels<br>
the product In aerosolized form. While some aerosol products are<br>
. propelled with compressed gases like carbon dioxide, nitrogen, nitrous<br>
oxide and even air, most commercial aerosols use liquefied gas<br>
propellants. The most commonly used liquefied gas propellants are<br>
hydrocarbons such as butane, isobutane, and propane. Dimethyl ether<br>
and HFC-152a (1,1-dtfluoroethane) are also used, either alone or in<br>
blends with the hydrocarbon propellants. Unfortunately, ail of these<br>
liquefied gas propellants are highly flammable and their incorporation into<br>
aerosol formulations will often result in flammable aerosol products.<br>
Applicants have come to appreciate the continuing need for<br>
nonflammable, liquefied gas propellants with which to formulate aerosol<br>
products. The present Invention provides compositions of the present<br>
invention, particularly and preferably compositions comprising HFO-1234,<br>
and even more preferably HFO-1234ze, for use in certain industrial<br>
aerosol products, including for example spray cleaners, lubricants, and the<br>
like, and in medicinal aerosols, including for example to deliver<br>
medications to the lungs or mucosal membranes. Examples of this<br>
includes metered dose inhalers (MDIs) for the treatment of asthma and<br>
other chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and for delivery of<br>
medicaments to accessible mucous membranes or intranasally- The<br>
present invention thus includes methods for treating ailments, diseases<br>
and similar health related problems of an organism {such as a human or<br>
animal) comprising applying a composition of the present Invention<br>
containing a medicament or othertherapeutic component to the organism<br>
in need of treatment In certain preferred embodiments, the step of<br>
applying the present composition comprises providing a MDI containing<br>
the composition of the present Invention {for example, introducing the<br><br>
c»mpc«JbonlntDtheM01)arritheodbcharglogtt»p«es«ntconipos«k«<br>
from the MD).<br>
The compositions of the present Invention, particularly compositions<br>
comprising or consisting essentialy of HFO-1234ZB. are capable of<br>
providing nonflammable, Dqusfod gas propesantand aerosols that do not<br>
cortrfautesubstamlafly to global vvartning. The present compositions can<br>
be used to formulate a variety of industrial aerosols or other sprayable<br>
compositions such as contact cleaners, dusters, lubricant sprays, and the<br>
Bee, and consumer aerosols such as personal car* products, household<br>
products and automotive products. HFO-1234ze Is particularly preferred<br>
for use as an important component of propeSant compoeWons for In<br>
medicinal aerosols such as metered dose Inhalers. Tha medicinal aerosol<br>
and/or propaBant and/or sprayabie oomposfbons ot the present invention<br>
h many appBcattons Include, tn addition to compound of formula (I) or (II)<br>
(preferably HF01234ze), a medicament such as a beta-agonist, a<br>
corticosteroid or other medtoarnent, and, opttonaBy. other Ingredients,<br>
such as surfactants, solvents, other propelants, flavorants and other<br>
exdpients. The compositions of the present Invention, unito many<br>
compositions previously used in these appBcattons, have good<br>
environmental properties and are not considered to be potential<br>
contributors to global warmtig. The present cornposftons therefore<br>
provide In certain preferred embodiments subetantialy rorrftonmabte,<br>
Iquefied gas propeOants having very iow Global Warming potentials.<br>
FLAVORANTS AND FRAGRANCES<br>
The compositions of the present invention also provide advantage<br>
when used as part of, and In particular as a carrier for, flavor formulations<br>
arid fragrance formulations. TtosuttabOrryof tfwpresericctrnposttionsfor<br>
this purpose Is demonstrated by a test procedure In wMch 0.38 grams of<br>
Jasmone were put Into a heavy waBed glass tube. 1.73grameofR-<br><br>
1234Z8 were added to the glass tube. The tube was then frozen and<br>
sealed. Upon thawing the tube, It was found that the mixture had one<br>
liquid phase. The solution contained 20 wL % Jasome and 80 wt % R-<br>
1234ze, thus establishing Its favorable use as a carrier or part of delivery<br>
system for flavor formulations, In aerosol and other formulations. It also<br>
establishes its potential as an extractant of fragrances, including from<br>
plant matter.<br>
METHODS AND SYSTEMS<br>
The compositions of the present invention are useful in connection<br>
with numerous methods and systems, including as heat transfer fluids in<br>
methods and systems for transferring heat, such as refrigerants used in<br>
refrigeration, air conditioning and heat pump systems. The present<br>
compositions are also advantageous for in use in systems and methods of<br>
generating aerosols, preferably comprising or consisting of the aerosol<br>
propeltant in such systems and methods. Methods of forming foams and<br>
methods of extinguishing and suppressing fire are also included In certain<br>
aspects of the present invention. The present invention also provides in<br>
certain aspects methods of removing residue from articles in which the<br>
present compositions are used as solvent compositions in such methods<br>
and systems.<br>
HEAT TRANSFER METHODS<br>
. The preferred heat transfer methods generally comprise providing a<br>
composition of the present Invention and causing heat to be transferred to<br>
or from the composition changing the phase of the-composition, for<br>
example, the present methods provide cooling by absorbing heat from a<br>
fluid or article, preferably by evaporating the present refrigerant<br>
composition in the vicinity of the body or fluid to be cooled to produce<br>
vapor comprising the present composition. Preferably the methods<br>
include the further step of compressing the refrigerant vapor, usually with<br>
a compressor or similar equipment to produce vapor of the present<br><br>
composition at a relatively elevated pressure. Generally, the step of<br>
compressing the vapor results In the addition of heat to the vapor, thus<br>
causing an increase in the temperature of the relatively high-pressure<br>
vapor. Preferably, the present methods Include removing from this<br>
relatively high temperature, nigh pressure vapor at least a portion of the<br>
heat added by the evaporation and compression steps. The heat removal<br>
step preferably includes condensing the high temperature, high-pressure<br>
vapor while the vapor Is in a relatively high-pressure condition to produce<br>
a relatively high-pressure liquid comprising a composition of the present<br>
Invention. This relatively high-pressure liquid preferably then undergoes a<br>
nominally isoenthalplc reduction In pressure to produce a relatively low<br>
temperature, low-pressure liquid, in such embodiments, it is this reduced<br>
temperature refrigerant liquid which is then vaporized by heat transferred<br>
from the body or fluid to be cor Mii.<br>
in another process embodiment of the invention, the compositions<br>
of the invention may be used in a method for producing heating which<br>
comprises condensing a refrigerant comprising the compositions In the<br>
vicinity of a liquid or body to be heated. Such methods, as mentioned<br>
hereinbefore, frequently are reverse cycles to the refrigeration cycle<br>
described above.<br>
' FOAM BLOWING METHODS<br>
One embodiment of the p.esent invention relates to methods of<br>
forming foams, and preferably polyurethane and poiyfeocyarHirate foams.<br>
The methods generally comprise providing a blowing agent composition of<br>
the present inventions, adding (directly or indirectly) the blowing agent<br>
composition to a foamable composition, and reacting the foamable<br>
composition under the conditions effective to form a foam or cellular<br>
structure, as is well known in the art. Any of the methods well Known in<br>
the art, such as those described in "Polyurethanes Chemistry and<br>
Technology,* Volumes I and II, Saunders and Frisch, 1962, John Wiley<br><br>
and Sons, New York, NY, which Is incorporated herein by reference, may<br>
be used or adapted for use hi accordance with the foam embodiments of<br>
the present invention. In general, such preferred methods comprise<br>
preparing polyurethane or polyisocyanurate foams by combining an<br>
Isocyanate, a polyo) or mixture of polyols, a blowing agent or mixture of<br>
blowing agents comprising one or more of the present compositions, and<br>
other materials such as catalysts, surfactants, and optionally, flame<br>
retardants, colorants, or other additives.<br>
it is convenient In many applications to provide the components for<br>
polyurethane or polyisocyanurate foams In pre-blended formulations.<br>
Most typically, the foam formulation is pre-blended into two components.<br>
The isocyanate and optionally certain surfactants and blowing agents<br>
comprise the first component commonly referred to as the "A" component<br>
The polyol or polyo! mixture, surfactant catalysts, blowing agents, flame<br>
retardant and other isocyanate reactive components comprise the second<br>
component commonly referred to as the "B" component Accordingly,<br>
polyurethane or polyisocyanurate foams are readily prepared by bringing<br>
together the A and B side components either by hand mix for small<br>
preparations and, preferably, machine mix techniques to form blocks,<br>
slabs, laminates, pour-in-place panels and other items, spray applied<br>
foams, froths, and the Bke. Optionally, other ingredients such as fire<br>
retardants, colorants, auxiliary blowing agents, and even other polyols can<br>
be added as a third stream to the mix head or reaction site. Most<br>
preferably, however, they are all incorporated into one B-component as<br>
described above.<br>
It is also possible to produce thermoplastic foams using the<br>
compositions of the invention. For example, conventional polystyrene and<br>
polyethylene formulations may be combined with the compositions in a<br>
conventional manner to produce rigid foams.<br><br>
CLEANING METHODS<br>
The present invention also provides methods of removing<br>
containments from a product part, component, substrate, or any other<br>
article or portion thereof by applying to the article a composition of the<br>
present inventfon. For the purposes of convenience, the term 'article" Is<br>
used herein to refer to all such products, parts, components, substrates,<br>
and the like and is further intended to refer to any surface or portion<br>
thereof. Furthermore, the term "contaminant" is intended to refer to any<br>
unwanted material or substance present on the article, even if such<br>
substance is placed on the article intentionally. For example, in the<br>
manufacture of semiconductor devices it is common to deposit a<br>
photoresist material onto a substrate to form a mask for the etching<br>
operation and to subsequently remove the photoresist material from the<br>
substrate. The term "contaminant* as used herein Is intended to cover<br>
and encompass such a photo resist material.<br>
Preferred methods of the present invention comprise applying the<br>
present composition to the article. Although It is contemplated that<br>
numerous and varied cleaning techniques can employ the compositions of<br>
the present invention to good advantage, it is considered to be particularly<br>
advantageous to use the present compositions In connection with<br>
supercritical cleaning techniques. Supercritical cleaning is disclosed in US<br>
Patent No. 6,589,355, which is assigned to the assignee of the present<br>
invention and incorporated herein by reference. For supercritical cleaning<br>
applications, Is preferred in certain embodiments to Include in the present<br>
cleaning compositions, in addition to the HFO-1234 (preferably HFO-<br>
1234ze), one or more additional components, such as C02 and other<br>
additional components known for use In connection with supercritical<br>
cleaning applications. It may also be possible and desirable in certain<br>
embodiments to use the present cleaning compositions in connection with<br>
particular vapor degreasing and solvent cleaning methods.<br><br>
FLAMMAB1LITY REDUCTION METHODS<br>
According to certain other preferred embodiments, the present<br>
invention provides methods for reducing the flammabiiity of fluids, said<br>
methods comprising adding a compound or composition of the present<br>
invention to said fluid. The flammabiiity associated with any of a wide<br>
range of otherwise flammable fluids may be reduced aocording to the<br>
present invention. For example, the flammabiiity associated with fluids<br>
such as ethylene oxide, flammable hydrofluorocarbons and hydrocarbons,<br>
including: HFC-1S2a, 1,1,1^nTiuoroetrane(HFC-143a),ditluorornethane<br>
(HFC-32), propane, hexane. octane, and the like can be reduced<br>
according to the present Invention. For the purposes of the present<br>
invention, a flammable fluid may be any fluid exhibiting flammabiiity<br>
ranges in air as measured via any standard conventional test method,<br>
such as ASTM E-681, and the like.<br>
Any suitable amounts of the present compounds or compositions<br>
may be added to reduce flammabiiity of a fluid according to the present<br>
invention. As will be recognized by those of skill in the art, the amount<br>
added will depend, at least In part, on the degree to which the subject fluid<br>
Is flammable and the degree to which ft is desired to reduce the<br>
flammabiiity thereof. In certain preferred embodiments, the amount of<br>
compound or composition added to the flammable fluid Is effective to<br>
render the resulting fluid substantially non-flammable.<br>
FLAME SUPPRESSION METHODS<br>
The present invention further provides methods of suppressing a<br>
flame, said methods comprising contacting a flame with a fluid .comprising<br>
a compound or composition of the present invention. Any suitable<br>
methods for contacting the flame with the present composition may tie<br>
used. For example, a composition of the present invention may be<br>
sprayed, poured, and the like onto the flame, or at toast a portion of the<br><br>
flame may be immersed in the composition. In light of the teachings<br>
herein, those of skill In the art will be readily able to adapt a Variety of<br>
conventional apparatus and methods of flame suppression for use in the<br>
present invention.<br>
STERILIZATION METHODS<br>
Many articles, devices and materials, particularly for use in the<br>
medical field, must be sterilized prior to use for the health and safety<br>
reasons, such as the health and safety of patients and hospital staff. The<br>
present Invention provides methods of sterilizing comprising contacting the<br>
articles, devices or material to be sterilized with a compound or<br>
composition of the present invention comprising a compound of Formula I,<br>
preferably HFO-1234, and even more preferably HFO-1234ze, in<br>
combination with one or more sterilizing agents. While many sterilizing<br>
agents are known in the art and are considered to be adaptable for use in<br>
connection with the present invention, In certain preferred embodiments<br>
sterilizing agent comprises ethylene oxide, formaldehyde, hydrogen<br>
peroxide, chlorine dioxide, ozone and combinations of these. In certain<br>
embodiments, ethylene oxide is the preferred sterilizing agent Those<br>
skilled in the art, in view of the teachings contained herein, will be able to<br>
readily determine the relative proportions of sterilizing agent and the<br>
present compound(s) to be used In connection with the present sterilizing<br>
compositions and methods, and all such ranges are within the broad<br>
scope hereof. As is known to those skilled in the art, certain sterilizing<br>
agents, such as ethylene oxide, are relatively flammable components, and<br>
the compound(s) in accordance with the present invention are included hi<br>
the present compositions in amounts effective, together with other<br>
components present in the composition, to reduce the flammability of the<br>
sterilizing composition to acceptable levels.<br>
The sterilization methods of the present invention may be either<br>
high or low-temperature sterilization of the present invention involves the<br><br>
use of a compound or composition of the present Invention at a<br>
temperature of from about 250°F to about?270,&gt;F, preferably in a<br>
substantially sealed chamber. The process can be completed usually in<br>
less than about 2 hours. However, some articles, such as plastic articles<br>
and electrical components, cannot withstand such high temperatures and<br>
require low-temperature sterilization. In low temperature sterilization<br>
methods, the article to be sterilised is exposed to a fluid comprising a<br>
composition of Hie present invention at a temperature of from about room<br>
temperature to about 200°F, more preferably at a temperature of from<br>
about room temperature to about 100°F.<br>
The low-temperature sterilization of the present invention is<br>
preferably at least a two-step process performed in a substantially sealed,<br>
preferably air tight, chamber, in the first step (the sterilization step), the<br>
articles having been cleaned and wrapped in gas permeable bags are<br>
placed in the chamber. Air Is then evacuated from the chamber by pulling<br>
a vacuum and perhaps by displacing the air with steam. In certain<br>
embodiments, ft is preferable to inject steam into the chamber to achieve a<br>
relative humidity that ranges preferably from about 30% to about 70%.<br>
Such humidities may maximize the sterilizing effectiveness of the sterilant,<br>
which is introduced into the chamber after the desired relative humidity ts<br>
achieved. After a period of time sufficient for the sterilant to permeate the<br>
wrapping and reach the interstices of the article, the sterilant and steam<br>
are evacuated from the chamber.<br>
In the preferred second step of the process (the aeration step), the<br>
articles are aerated to remove sterilant residues. Removing such residues<br>
is particularly important in the case of toxic sterilants, although it is<br>
optional in those cases in which the substantially non-toxic compounds of<br>
the present invention are used. Typical aeration processes include air<br>
washes, continuous aeration, and a combination of the two. An air wash<br>
is a batch process and usually comprises evacuating the chamber for a<br><br>
relatively short period, for example, 12 minutes, and then introducing air at<br>
atmospheric pressure or higher into the chamber. This cycle is repeated<br>
any number of times unfit the desired removal of sterilant Is achieved.<br>
Continuous aeration typically involves introducing air through an Inlet at<br>
one side of the chamber and then drawing it out through an outlet on the<br>
other side of the chamber by applying a slight vacuum to the outlet<br>
Frequently, the two approaches ate combined. For example, a common<br>
approach involves performing air washes and then an aeration cycle.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The following examples are provided for the purpose of illustrating<br>
the present Invention but without limiting the scope thereof.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
The coefficient of performance (COP) is a universally accepted<br>
measure of refrigerant performance, especially useful in representing the<br>
relative thermodynamic efficiency of a refrigerant in a specific heating or<br>
cooling cycle involving evaporation or condensation of the refrigerant In<br>
refrigeration engineering, this term expresses the ratio of useful<br>
refrigeration to the energy applied by the compressor in compressing the<br>
vapor. The capacity of a refrigerant represents the amount of cooling or<br>
heating It provides and provides some measure of the capability of a<br>
compressor to pump quantities of heat for a given volumetric flow rate of<br>
refrigerant In other words, given a specific compressor, a refrigerant with<br>
a higher capacity will deliver more cooling or heating power. One means<br>
tor estimating COP of a refrigerant at specific operating conditions is from<br>
the thermodynamic properties of the refrigerant using standard<br>
refrigeration cycle analysis techniques (see for example, R.C. Downing,<br>
RUOROCARBON REFRIGERANTS HANDBOOK, Chapter 3, Prentice-<br>
Hall, 1988).<br><br>
A refrigeration /air conditioning cycle system is provided where the<br>
condenser temperature is about 150"F and the evaporator temperature is<br>
about -35°F under nominally feentropic compression with a compressor<br>
inlet temperature of about 50°F. COP is determined for several<br>
compositions of the present invention over a range of condenser and<br>
evaporator temperatures and reported in Table I below, based upon HFC-<br>
134a having a COP value of 1.00, a capacity value of 1.00 and a<br>
discharge temperature of 175 °F.<br><br>
This example shows that certain of the preferred compounds for<br>
use with the present compositions each have a better energy efficiency<br>
than HFC-134a {1.02,1.04 and 1.13 compared to 1.00) and the<br>
compressor using the present refrigerant compositions will produce<br>
discharge temperatures (158,165 and 155 compared to 175), which is<br>
advantageous since such result will likely leading to reduced maintenance<br>
problems.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
The miscibility of HFO-1225ye and HFO-1234ze with various<br>
refrigeration lubricants is tested. The lubricants tested are mineral oil<br>
(C3), alkyl benzene (Zerol 150), ester oil (Mobil EAL 22 cc and Solest<br>
120), polyalkylene glycol (PAG) on {Goodwrench Refrigeration OH for 134a<br>
systems), and a poWalpha-olefin) oil{CP«005-100). For-each<br>
refrigerantfoll combination, throe compositions are tested, namely 5,20<br><br>
and 50 weight percent of lubricant, with the balance of each being the<br>
compound of the present Invention being tested<br>
The lubricant compositions are placed in heavy-walled glass tubes.<br>
The tubes are evacuated, the refrigerant compound in accordance with the<br>
present invention is added, and the tubes are then sealed; The tubes are<br>
then put into an air br, i environmental chamber, the temperature of which<br>
is varied from about-SO'C to 70*C. At roughly 10*C intervals, visual<br>
observations of the tube contents are r-ade for the existence of one or<br>
more liquid phases. In a case where more than one liquid phase is<br>
observed, the mixture Is reported to be Immiscible. In a case where there<br>
is only one liquid phase observed, the mixture is reported to be miscible.<br>
In those cases where two liquid phases were observed, but with one of the<br>
liquid phases occupying only a very small volume, the mixture is reported<br>
to be partially miscible.<br>
The polyalkylene glycol and ester of) lubricants were judged to be<br>
miscible In all tested proportions over the entire temperature range, except<br>
that for the HKM225ye mixtures with polyalkylene glycol, the refrigerant<br>
mixture was found to be immiscible over the temperature range of -SO'C<br>
to-30'C and to be partially miscible over from-20 to 50*C. At 50 weight<br>
percent concentration of the PAG in refrigerant and at 60*, the<br>
refrigerant/PAG mixture was miscible. At 70°C, ft was miscible from 5<br>
weight percent lubricant In refrigerant to 50 weight percent lubricant in<br>
refrigerant<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The compatibility of the refrigerant compounds and compositions of<br>
the present invention with PAG lubricating oHs while in contact with metals<br>
used in refrigeration and air conditioning systems is tested at 350° C,<br>
representing conditions much more severe than are found In many<br>
refrigeration and air conditioning applications.<br>
Aluminum, copper and steel coupons are added to heavy walled<br><br>
glass tubes. Two grams ofoil are added to the tubes. The tubes are then evacuated and one gram of refrigerant is added. The tubes are put Into an<br>
oven at 350°F for one week and visual observations are made. At the end<br>
of the exposure period, the tubes are removed.<br>
This procedure was done for the following combinations of oil and<br>
the compound of the present invention:<br>
a)	HFO-1234ze and GM Goodwrench PAG oil<br>
b)	HF01243zf and GM Goodwrench oB PAG oil<br>
c)	HFO-1234zeandMOPAR-56PAGoll<br>
d)	HFO-1243zfandMOPAR-56PAGoil<br>
e)	HFO-1225yeandMOPAR-56PAGoil.<br>
In all cases, there Is minimal change in the appearance of the<br>
contents of the tube. This indicates that the refrigerant compounds and<br>
compositions of the present invention are stable in contact with aluminum,<br>
steel and copper found in refrigeration and air conditioning systems, and<br>
the types of lubricating oils that are likely to be included in such<br>
compositions or used with such compositions In these types of systems.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE<br>
Aluminum, copper and steel coupons are added to a heavy walled<br>
glass tube with mineral oil and CFC-12 and heated for one week at 350°C,<br>
as in Example 3. At the em) of file exposure period, the tube is removed<br>
and visual observations are made. The liquid contents are observed to<br>
turn black, indicating there is severe decomposition of the contents of the<br>
tube.<br>
CFC-12 and mineral oil have heretofore been the combination of<br>
choice in many refrigerant systems and methods. Thus, the refrigerant<br>
compounds and compositions of the present invention possess<br>
significantly better stability with many commonly used lubricating oils than<br>
the widely used prior art refrigerant-lubricating oil combination.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 4 - POLYOL FOAM<br>
This example illustrates the use of blowing agent in accordance<br>
with one of the preferred embodiments of the present invention, namely<br>
the use of HF0-I234ze, and the production of polyol foams in accordance<br>
with the present Invention. The components of a polyol foam formulation<br>
are prepared in accordance with the following table:<br>
Polvol Component* PBW<br>
Voranol 490	50<br>
Voranol391	50<br>
Water	0.5<br>
B-8462 (surfactant)	2.0<br>
Polycat 8	0.3<br>
Polycat41	3.0<br>
HFO-1234ze	35<br>
Total	140.8<br>
lsocvanate<br>
M-20S	123.8 Index 1.10<br>
*Voranoi 490 is a sucrose-based polyol and Voranol 391<br>
is a toluene diamine based polvol, and each are from<br>
Dow Chemical. B-8462 Is a surfactant available from<br>
Degussa-Goldschmidt Polycat catalysts are tertiary<br>
amine based and are available from Air Products.<br>
Isocyanate M-20S Is a product of Bayer LLC.<br>
The foam is prepared by first mixing the ingredients thereof, but without<br>
the addition of blowing agent. Two Fisher-Porter tubes are each filled with<br>
about 52.6 grams of the polyol mixture (without blowing agent) and sealed<br>
and placed in a refrigerator to cool and form a slight vacuum. Using gas<br>
burets, about 17.4 grams of HFO-1234ze are added to each tube, and the<br>
tubes are then placed in an ultrasound bath in warm water and allowed to<br>
sit for 30 minutes. The solution produced is hazy, a vapor pressure<br>
measurement at room temperature indicates a vapor pressure of about 70<br>
psig, indicating that the blowing agent is not in solution. The tubes are<br><br>
then placed in a freezer at 27" F for 2 hours. The vapor pressure was<br>
again measured and found to be 14-psig. The isocyanate mixture, about<br>
87.9 grams, is placed into a metal container and placed In a refrigerator<br>
and allowed to cool to about 508F. The polyol tubes were then opened<br>
and weighed into a metal mixing container^about 100 grams of polyol<br>
blend are used). The Isocyanate from the cooled metal container is then<br>
Immediately poured into the polyol and mixed with an air mixer with double<br>
propellers at 3000 RPM*s for 10 seconds. The blend Immediately begins to<br>
froth with the agitation and Is then poured into an 8x8x4 inch box and<br>
allowed to foam. Because of the froth, a cream time cannot be measured.<br>
The foam has a 4-minute gel time and a 5-mFnute tack free time. The foam<br>
Is then allowed to cure for two days at room temperature.<br>
The foam is then cut to samples suitable for measuring physical properties<br>
and is found to have a density of 2.14 pcf. K-factors are measured and<br>
found to be as follows:<br>
Temperature	K, BTU In / Ft2 h "F<br>
40°F	.1464<br>
75°F	.1640<br>
110"	.1808<br>
EXAMPLE 5 - POLYSTYRENE FOAM<br>
This example illustrates the use of blowing agent in accordance<br>
with two preferred embodiments of the present invention, namely the use<br>
of HFO-1234ze and HFO-1234-yf, and the production of polystyrene foam.<br>
A testing apparatus and protocol has been-established as an aid to<br>
determining whether a specific blowing agent and polymer are capable of<br>
producing a foam and the quality of the foam. Ground polymer (Dow<br>
Polystyrene 68SD) and blowing agent consisting essentially of HFO-<br>
1234ze are combined in a vessel A sketch of the vessel Is illustrated<br>
below. The vessel volume is 200 cm3 and it is made from two pipe flanges<br><br>
and a section of 2-inch diameter schedule 40 stainless steel pipe 4 inches<br>
long (see Figure 1). The vessel is placed in an oven, with temperature set<br>
at from about 190°F to about 285°F, preferably for polystyrene at 266°F,<br>
and remains there until temperature equilibrium is reached.<br>
The pressure in the vessel is then released, quickly producing a<br>
foamed polymer. The btowing agent plastldzes the polymer as it<br>
dissolves into it The resulting density of the two foams thus produced<br>
using this method are given in Table 1 and graphed in Figure 1 as the<br>
density of the foams produced using trans-HFO-1234ze and HFO-1234yf.<br>
The data show that foam polystyrene is obtainable in accordance with the<br>
present invention. The die temperature for R1234ze with polystyrene is<br>
about 250'P.<br><br>
