COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10 and Rule 13]<br>
"A PROCESS OF PREPARING 4-[PHENYL-(PIPERIDIN-4-YL) AMINOJ-BENZAMIDE DERIVATIVES<br>
ASTRAZENECA AB, a Swedish company of S-151 85 Sodertalje, Sweden,<br>
The   following   specification   particularly  describes   the   nature   of  the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
WO 02/094782<br><br>
PCT/SE02/00944<br><br><br>
Field of the Invention<br>
5      The present invention is directed to novel compounds, to a process for their preparation, their . use and pharmaceutical compositions comprising the novel compounds. The novel compounds are useful in therapy, and in particular for the treatment of pain, anxiety and functional gastrointestinal disorders.<br>
10     Background of the Invention<br>
The S receptor has been identified as having a role in many bodily functions such as circulatory and pain systems. Ligands for the 5 receptor may therefore find potential use as analgesics, and/or as antihypertensive agents. Ligands for the 5 receptor have also been shown 15      to possess immunomodulatory activities.<br>
The identification of at least three different populations of opioid receptors (fx, 5 and K) is now well established and all three are apparent in both central and peripheral nervous systems of many species including man. Analgesia has been observed in various animal models when one 20      or more of these receptors has been activated.<br>
With few exceptions, currently available selective opioid 5 ligands are peptidic in nature and are unsuitable for administration by systemic routes. One example of a non-peptidic 5-agonist is SNC80 (Bilsky E.J. et al, Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental 25      Therapeutics, 273(1), pp. 359-366 (1995)). There is however still a need for selective 5-agonists having not only improved selectivity, but also an improved side-effect profile.<br>
Thus, the problem underlying the present invention was to find new analgesics having improved analgesic effects, but also with an improved side-effect profile over current \i 30      agonists, as well as having improved systemic efficacy.<br><br>
WO 02/094 782<br><br><br><br>
PCT/SE02/0Q944<br><br>
Analgesics that have been identified and are existing in the prior art have many disadvantages in that they suffer from poor pharmacokinetics and are not analgesic when administered by systemic routes. Also, it has been documented that preferred 5 agonist compounds, described within the prior art, show significant convulsive effects when administered systemically.<br>
5<br>
We have now found certain compounds that exhibit surprisingly improved properties, i.a. improved 5-agonist potency, in vivo potency, pharmacokinetic, bioavailability, in vitro stability and/or lower toxicity.<br>

The agonist activity of the compounds is measured by deterrriining the degree to which the compounds receptor complex activates the" binding of GTP to G-proteins to which the receptors are coupled. In the GTP binding assay, GTP[Y]35S is combined with test compounds and membranes from HEK-293S cells expressing the cloned human opioid receptors or from 10 homogenised rat and mouse brain. Agonists stimulate GTP[y] S binding in these membranes. The EC50 and Emax values of compounds are determined from dose-response curves. Right shifts of the dose response curve by the delta antagonist naltrindole are performed to verify that agonist activity is mediated through delta receptors.<br>
15     The plates are vortexed and incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature, filtered on Unifilters GF/B (presoaked in water) with the Tomtec or Packard harvester using 4 ml of wash buffer (50 mM Tris, 5 mM MgCl2; 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.0). The filters are dried for 1 hour at 55°C. The radioactivity (cpm) is counted in a TopCount (Packard) after adding 65 ul/well of MS-20 scintillation liquid. The stimulation (SB) in the presence of ligands is<br>
20     expressed as percentage of Emax of the reference agonist. Values of EC50 for ligands in stimulating radioligand binding are calculated in Activity Base. Mean ± S.E.M. values of EC50 and % Emax are reported for ligands tested in at least three dose-response curves.<br>

DETERMINATION OF MECHANO-ALLODYNIA USING VON FREY TESTING<br>
25 Testing was performed between 08:00 and 16:00h using the method described by Chaplan et al. (1994). Rats were placed in Plexiglas cages on top of a wire mesh bottom which allowed access to the paw, and were left to habituate for 10-15 min.   The area tested was the mid-<br>

WO 02/094782<br><br>
PCT/SE02/00944<br><br>
plantar left hind paw, avoiding the less sensitive foot pads. The paw was touched with a series of 8 Von Frey hairs with logarithmically incremental stiffness (0.41, 0.69, 1.20, 2.04, 3.63, 5.50, 8.51, and 15.14 grams; Stoelting, 111, USA). The von Frey hair was applied from underneath the rnesh floor perpendicular to the plantar surface with sufficient force to cause a 5 slight buckling against the paw, and held for approximately 6-8 seconds. A positive response was noted if the paw was sharply withdrawn. Flinching immediately upon removal of the hair was also considered a positive response. Ambulation was considered an ambiguous response, and in such cases the stimulus was repeated.<br>
10      Testing Protocol<br>
The animals were tested on postoperative day 1 for the FCA-treated group. "The 50% withdrawal threshold was determined using the up-down method of Dixon (1980). Testing was started with the 2.04 g hair, in the middle of the series. Stimuli were always presented in a consecutive way, whether ascending or descending.   In the absence of a paw withdrawal<br>
is response to the initially selected hair, a stronger stimulus was presented; in the event of paw withdrawal, the next weaker stimulus was chosen. Optima] threshold calculation by this method requires 6 responses in the immediate vicinity of the 50% threshold, and counting of these 6 responses began when the first change in response occurred, e.g. the threshold was first crossed.   In cases where thresholds fell outside the range of stimuli, values of 15.14<br>
20 (normal sensitivity) or 0.41 (maximally allodynic) were respectively assigned. The resulting pattern of positive and negative responses was tabulated using the convention, X =" no withdrawal; O = withdrawal, and the 50% withdrawal threshold was interpolated using the formula:<br>
25	50% g threshold = 10(Xf+k8) / 10,000<br>
where Xf= value of the last von Frey hair used (log units); k - tabular value (from Chaplan et al. (1994)) for the pattern of positive / negative responses; and 5 = mean difference between stimuli (log units). Here 5 = 0.224.<br>

Von Frey thresholds were converted to percent of maximum possible effect (% MFE), according to Chaplan et al. 1994. The following equation was used to compute % MPE:<br>
% MPE = Drug treated threshold (g) - allodynia threshold (g) X 100<br>

ADMINISTRATION OF TEST SUBSTANCE<br>
Rats were injected (subcutaneously, intraperitoneally, intravenously or orally) with a test substance prior to von Frey testing, the time between administration of test compound and the 10     von Frey test varied depending upon the nature of the test compound.<br>

1011/MUMNP/2003, 1018/MUMNP/2003, 1012/MUMNP/2003, 1014/MUMNP/2003, 1015/MUMNP/2003, 1016/MUMNP/2003 and 1017/MUMNP/2003.<br><br><br>
WE CLAIM:-<br>
1.       A process  for preparing a compound 4-[phenyl-(piperidin-4-yl)-arnino-benzamide derivatives of formula I,<br><br><br><br>
comprising reacting a compound of the general formula II<br>
O<br><br>
wherein PG is a urethane protecting group, such as Boc and CBZ or benzyl or substituted benzyl protecting group, such as 2,4-dimethoxybenzyl, with 3-bromobenzonitrile, using a palladium catalyst,  Pd2(dba)3, in the presence of a base, preferably sodium tert-butoxide, and a phosphine ligand such as heTein described to give the compounds of general formula III,<br><br><br><br><br>
which is thereafter deprotected, under standard conditions and alkylated under reductive conditions with a compound of the general formula R1 CHO to give the compounds of the general formula I,<br>
38<br><br>
wherein R1 is selected from any one of phenyl, pyridinyl, thienyl, furyl, imidazolyl, triazolyl, pyrrolyl, thiazolyl and pyridyl-N-oxide; wherein each R1 phenyl ring and R1 heteroaromatic ring may independently be further substituted by 1, 2 or 3 substituents independently selected from straight and branched C1-C6 alkyl, N02, CF3, C1-C6 alkoxy, chloro, fluoro, bromo and iodo, as well as salts thereof.</td>
