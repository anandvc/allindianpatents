				<td>The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of cis (-) lamivudine.<br>
The present invention particularly relates to an improved process for the enzymatic preparation of optically pure (-)-cis-4-amino-1-(2-hydroxymethyl-1,3-oxathiolane-5-yl)-(1H)-pyrimidin-2-one (Lamivudine) 1. The process of this invention comprises the step of enantio- and stereoselective hydrolysis of a racemic mixture of 1,3-oxathiolane nucleoside analogues of formula 2 wherein RCO is a substituted carbonyl derivative where the non-caibonyl moiety R of the ester is selected from straight or branch chained alkyl (e.g. methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, n-butyl), alkoxyalkyl (e.g. methoxymethyl), arylalkyl (e.g. benzyl), aryloxylalkyl (e.g. phenoxymethyl), aryl (e.g. phenyl optionally substituted by hydroxy, or halogen), and aminoacid esters (e.g. L-valyl, or L-isoleucyl). with enzyme penicillin G acylase (EC. 3.5.1.11).<br>
(FormulaRemoved)<br>
Resolution of racemic 1,3-oxathiolane nucleoside analogues of formula 2 is an industrially important process since the optically pure forms e.g. of (-)-c/s-4-amino-1-(2-hydroxymethyl-1,3-oxathione-5-yl)-(1H)-pyrimidine-2-one (Lamivudine) is an effective antiviral agent against HIV, HBV, and other viruses replicating in a similar manner.<br>
The synthetic routes to racemic 1,3-oxathiolane nucleoside analogues of formula 2 usually provide a mixture of cis- and trans- diastereomers. Reference may be made to the work of the Glaxo Group Research Limited (Int.pat. WO 91/17159; Eur.Pat. EP 0513 917 A1), of Biochem Pharma Inc. Canada (EP 0 515 157 A1), of Number and coworkers (Humber, D; Jones M.F.; Payne.J.J.; Ramsay, M.V.J. Tetrahedron Lett. 1992, 33, 4624), Jeong.L.S.; Alves, A.J.; Carrigan.S.W.; Kim H.O.; Beach.W.; Chu, C.K. Tetrahedron Lett. 1992, 33, 595.) and of Beach and coworkers (Beach, J.W. et al<br>
J.Org.Chem. 1992, 57, 2217). The c/s and trans forms are separated by repeated crystallizations. One of the hitherto known enzymatic processes for the preparation of (-)-c/s-4-amino-1 -(2-hydroxymethyl-1,3-oxathione-5-yl)-(1 H)-pyrimidine-2-one 1 is based on destructive resolution of racemic cis-4-amino-1-(2-hydroxymethyl-1,3-oxathione-5-yl)-(1H)-pyrimidine-2-one. Reference may be made to the work of Mahmodian and coworkers (Mahmoudian.M.; Bains.B.S.; Drake, C.S.; Hale.R.S.; Jones,P.; Piercey.J.E.; Montgomey, D.S.; Purvis,I.J.; Storer, R. Et al. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 1993, 15 , 749) where the unwanted (+)-c/s-4-amino-1-(2-hydroxymethyl-1,3-oxathione-5-yl)-(1H)-pyrimidine-2-one is destroyed by reaction with enzyme cytidine deaminase. The residual c/s-(-)-1,3-oxathiolane nucleoside analogue of required stereochemistry is then isolated from the reaction mixture. The major drawback of this process is that the enzyme is not commercially available and has to be specially produced by fermentation. Another disadvantage of the process is that the unwanted isomer is completely destroyed and can not be racemized and recycled. This leads to a net loss of expensive raw materials.<br>
Other enzymatic routes to optically pure (-)-c/s-4-amino-1-(2-hydroxymethyl-1,3-oxathione-5-yl)-(1H)-pyrimidine-2-one (Lamivudine) are based on lipase mediated resolution of an optically pure intermediate such as an oxathiolane intermediate (Cousins,R.P.C.; Mahmoudin.M.; Youds.P.M. Tetrahedron: Asymmetry 1995, 6, 393) or an a-acetoxy sulphide which forms the required oxathiolane nucleus, which is then converted to target nucleoside in 4 steps (Milton,J.; Brand,S; Jones.M.F.; Rayner.C.M. Tetrahedron Lett. 1995, 36, 6961). These methods are indirect and the coupling of the intermediate oxathiolane is accompanied by a loss of optical purity which is not acceptable.<br>
A methodology to prepare optically pure (-)-cis-4-amino-1-(2-hydroxymethyl-1,3-oxathione-5-yl)-(1H)-pyrirnidine-2-one by resolution of racemic mixture of 1,3-oxathiolane nucleoside analogues of formula 2 by using lipases from different sources has been reported by Liotta and co-workers (Liotta; D.C., McDonough.G. A ; Schinazi; R. F. , Decatur, G. A ., Choi, W. B.; US patent: US5892025, 1998 and earlier patents cited therein). However this process has the disadvantage that the enzyme does not discriminate between the c/s and trans isomers and a pure c/s-isomef has to<br>
copolymer of acrylamide and N,N' - methylen-bis(acrylamide).<br>
In another embodiment of the invention the separation of (-)-cis-4-amino-1-(2-hydroxymethyl-1,3-oxathione-5-yl)-(1H)-pyrimidine-2-one 1 and 1,3-oxathiolane nucleoside analogues of formula 2 from the reaction mixture may be effected by freeze drying and extraction of the freeze dried residue with organic solvent such as chloroform, ethanol or methanol; evaporation of the solvent and column chromatography of the residue using an eluent comprising of a mixture of chloroform and methanol in the range 5-30%.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention the separation of (-)-c/s-4-amino-1-(2-hydroxymethyl-1,3-oxathione-5-yl)-(1H)-pyrimidine-2-one 1 and 1,3-oxathiolane nucleoside analogues of formula 2 from the reaction mixture may be effected by using adsorbant polymeric resins such as polystyrene (Amberlite XAD-4, XAD-7, XAD-16), polyacrylic esters (Amberlite XAD-7) and desorption of the material by extraction with methanol and evaporation of the solvent. Further purification if necessary may be done by and column chromatography of the residue using an eluent comprising of a mixture of chloroform and methanol in the range 5-30%.<br>
The invention is described in the following example by way of illustration only and should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention. The example what is provided describes the penicillin G acyalse enzyme mediated enantio- and stereoselective hydrolysis of a racemic mixture of 1,3-oxathiolane nucleoside analogues of formula 2 and an analytical method to determine the course of reaction based on HPLC analysis.<br>

The invention is described in the following example by way of illustration only<br>
'and should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention. The example what is provided describes the penicillin G acyalse enzyme mediated   enantio- and stereoselective  hydrolysis  of     a   racemic  mixture  of  1,3-oxathiolane   nucleoside analogues of formula 2 and an analytical method to determine the course of reaction based on HPLC analysis.<br>
Example 1 :<br>

Advantages:<br>
1.	Present invention utilizes the enzyme Penicillin G acylase,   which is a cheap and<br>
commercially available enzyme and has not been utilized before for the preparation of<br>
optically pure Lamivudine.<br>
2.	The enzyme can be used in immobilized form and recycled several times, thus<br>
reducing the cost of the enzyme.<br>
3.	The enzyme specifically hydrolyzes only the cis-derivative and it is not necessary to<br>
start with a pure cis-diastereomer. Thus a   diastereomeric mixture of 1,3-oxathiolane<br>
nucleoside analogues  of formula 2 can be used for the enzymatic reaction.<br>
4.	The unreacted 1,3-oxathiolane nucleoside analogues   of formula 2     can be easily<br>
removed from reaction mixture   by adsorption to polyacrylic ester (Amberlite XAD-7)<br>
resin    and can be recovered from the resin by simple stirring with methanol  in<br>
quantitative yields. The resin can again be reused.<br>
5.	The product (-)-cis-4-amino-1-(2-hydroxymethyl-1I3-oxathione-5-yl)-(1H)-pyrimidine-<br>
2-one (Lamivudine) in the reaction mixture can be easily removed from reaction mixture<br>
by adsorption to polystyrene  resin (Amberlite XAD-16) and can be recovered from the<br>
resin by simple stirring with methanol in quantitative yields. The resin can again<br>
be reused.<br>
6. The process produces very little effluent and is environmentally friendly.<br><br><br><br><br>
We claim:<br>

methods.<br>
2.	An improved process as claimed in claim 1 wherein the reaction is carried out with<br>
enzyme dissolved in aqueous buffer such as tris (hydroxymethyl) aminomethane or<br>
alternatively the enzyme may be immobilized on a solid support such as copolymer of<br>
methylacrylamide , N,N' - methylen-bis(acrylamide) and a monomer carrying oxirane<br>
groups (Eupergit C), copolymer of acrylamide and N,N' - methylen-bis(acrylamide).<br>
