1.	FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the carton design (Printed or un-printed) comprising of window with different models of grills which can provide the natural strength of carton, tamper evidence of the carton and count the number of packs through the window.<br>
2.	DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
The conventional window in a carton facilitates to count the number of packs, but the counting process is not complete or sometimes leads to wrong count because the window does not have an edge to edge cut. For every counting process, the window flap should be lifted. The perforated window will reduce the natural strength of the carton. Most of the time the window is not noticed by the end user, as the window is closed and perforated on just one side and the contents are not directly visible,<br>
One more type of conventional method is a window with a transparent plastic sheet or cover, wherein the plastic sheet should be combined or laminated to the carton on the windowing portion. This method involves extra cost for plastic sheet and extra method of operation. This system may not provide natural strength to the carton.<br><br>
3.      OBJECTIVE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The objective of the invention is to provide a windowing system to the carton.<br>
The next objective of the invention is to provide a carton having grill windowing system.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention is to provide a carton window with grill wherein the grill(s) are connected to the top and bottom cut portions of window.<br>
The next objective of the invention is to provide to a carton window with grills wherein the grills function as tamper evidence of window for any willful pilferage of product through window.<br>
The next objective of the invention is to provide to a carton window with grills wherein all the packs can be seen without extra effort.<br>
The next objective of the invention is to provide to a carton window with grills wherein all the packs can be counted without extra effort.<br>
The next objective of the invention is to provide to a carton window with grills wherein the grill will keep the natural strength of the carton, which is required to perform the carton function throughout its life.<br>
The next objective of the invention is to manufacture the carton window with grill system wherein the cost of the production is almost equal to the existing manufacturing methods of conventional window carton system.<br>
The next objective of the invention is to manufacture the carton window with grill system wherein the cost of the production is lower than the existing manufacturing methods of conventional window carton with transparent plastic sheet system.<br>
Therefore the present invention describes a carton window with grills that would help in counting all the packs without having hindrances.<br><br>
4.	BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present disclosure aims at carton with grill window, the grill or grills either in straight position or slahted position or vertical and horizontal combinations provide the edge to edge cutting of the carton board, tamper evidence in the case of willful pilferage, allows any person to count all the packs inside without opening the carton, keeps the natural strength of the carton even the carton board is punched for the window.<br>
The carton with grill window wherein the grill could be one or two or three or any suitable quantity according to the carton size and shape.<br>

6.   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The conventional carton windowing systems are Illustrated in figure-la, lb and Ic as an side view of the carton.<br>
The figures lla, llb, lle, lld, lle, llf, llg, and llh as shown are various embodiments of the present invention and it is to be noted that these embodiments do not define the limitations of the present invention.<br>
Figure lla : The drawing refers to the carton window of the present invention with single vertical grill shown in side view of the carton. In this embodiment, the vertical grill has been provided to protect the natural strength of the carton, in the conventional carton window the flap has been perforated one side either at the bottom or top side and the other side will be creased, so that the flap can be lifted after breaking the perforation. In this mechanism the window can not be provided edge to edge, if so the carton looses its natural strength. Therefore the product pack count is very difficult in the conventional<br><br>
window carton. More over the packs can be tampered through the conventional carton window once the perforation has been broken. Many times the conventional window will be deceptive since there is no special visual attention.<br>
The grill window mechanism provides the natural strength of the carton, since both open (cut) ends are connected. Grill is the part of the invention and this grill discourages the pilferage of packs through window and provides the visual attention to see or count the packs through it.<br>
The major advantage from this invention is to facilitate the counting easily from edge to edge so that it covers all the product pack count as defined on the carton. The counting is a general process to the shop-floor people to verify the carton pack and at retailer or any distribution person or end customer before opening the carton pack. If the counting of packs is difficult for the people involved in production, distribution and end usage, the counting should be done by opening the seal only. This activity is always subjective for answering the market complaint for any shortages. End user or any other involved person may lodge the complaint by deliberately removing the packs from seal opening side. This will be a serious loss to the company, since for every shortage complaint the same quantity of packs should be reimbursed.<br>
Some times the complaint is also correct, but the correct action on the shop floor will be difficult, since conventional window can not provide edge to edge checking.<br><br>
The carton window is being manufactured from the general carton manufacturing process. It does not require any special machinery<br>
Any number of Vertical grills can be produced according to the size and shape of the carton.<br>
The window dimensions are not limited to any particular dimensions, the dimensions can be provided according to the size and shape of the carton.<br>
Figure lib : The drawing refers to the carton window with double cross grill shown as a side view of the carton. In this embodiment the grill view appears as cross mark, connecting both the top and bottom ends of the window.<br>
Figure lie : The drawing refers to the carton window with double cross grill one is slanted and other one is parallel to the window as shown as a side view of the carton. In this embodiment the centre part of the window is parallel to the window and a slanted grill has also been provided.<br>
Figure lid :   The drawing refers to the carton window with single vertical grill with double profile as shown as a side view of the carton. Figure lie : The drawing refers to the carton window with double vertical grill as shown as a side view of the carton.<br><br>
Figure I If : The drawing refers to the carton window with single slanted grill as shown as a side view of the carton.<br>
Figure llg : The drawing refers to the carton window with double slanted grill as shown as a side view of the carton.<br>
Figure llh : The drawing refers to the carton window with double slanted grill one is in one direction and other one is opposite direction as shown as a side view of the carton.<br>
While this invention has been disclosed in its preferred forms, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that many modifications, additions, and deletions can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention and its equivalents as set forth in the said claims, process, advantages and drawings.<br>
7.   ADANTAGES OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention describes carton window with grills system, which facilitates the complete counting of the packs, keeps the natural strength of the carton and provides visual attention. Improper counting is a problem in the industry from shop-floor, distribution and end user side. Improper counting may lead to un-necessary complaints or willful pilferage. Moreover the natural carton strength can be retained with the present invention.<br><br><br><br>
