3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification describes the invention.<br><br>
Technical Field:<br>
The present invention relates to the process for preparation of Poly (allylamine-co-N,N'-diallyl-l,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) carbonate salt (Sevelamer carbonate) of Formula-I, an antihyperphosphatemic agent.<br><br>
a, b = number of primary amine groups a + b = 9<br>
c = number of crosslinking groups c = 1<br>
m = large number to indicate extended polymer network<br>
Background of the invention:<br>
Sevelamer carbonate is non-absorbable polymer marketed as Renvela™ by Genzyme Corporation. It is known chemically as poly(allylamine-cj)-N,N'-diallyl-l,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) carbonate salt. It was developed as a pharmaceutical alternative to Sevelamer hydrochloride (Renagel®). Renvela™ contains Sevelamer carbonate, a non-absorbed phosphate binding crosslinked polymer, free of metal and calcium. It contains multiple amines separated by one carbon from the polymer backbone. These amines exist in a protonated form in the intestine and interact with phosphate molecules through ionic and hydrogen bonding.  By binding phosphate -in the dietary tract and decreasing<br><br>
absorption, Sevelamer carbonate lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum. Sevelamer carbonate is an anion exchange resin with the same polymeric structure as Sevelamer hydrochloride in which carbonate replaces chloride as the counterion. While the counterions differ for the two salts, the polymer itself, the active moiety, is the same. The protonated amines can be indirectly measured as carbonate content in meq/gm. Renvela™ is used in End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) which leads to hyperphosphatemia due to retention of phosphorous. This condition can lead to ectopic calcification. Renvela™ binds dietory phosphate in GI tract and thus controls the serum phosphate levels. The potency of Renvela™ is measured in terms of its Phosphate Binding Capacity (PBC) by Phosphate Assay (PA). Treatment of hyperphosphatemia includes reduction in dietary intake of phosphate, inhibition of intestinal phosphate absorption with phosphate binders, and removal of phosphate with dialysis. Sevelamer carbonate taken with meals has been shown to control serum phosphorus concentrations in patients with CKD who are on dialysis. Currently Sevelamer hydrochloride is used to cure hyperphosphatemia. As a consequence ESRD patients still need a high dosage of Renagel® to meet clinical end-points, leading to adverse effect such as gastrointestinal discomfort and problems with patient compliance. But systemic acidosis development or worsening of pre-existing acidosis has been reported in many patients on long term dialysis who are given Sevelamer hydrochloride (Perit Dial Int. 2002, 22, 737-738, Nephron 2002, 92, 499-500, Kidney Int. 2004, 66, S39-S45, Ren. Fail 2005, 27,143-147).<br>
Administration of Sevelamer hydrochloride adds to metabolic acid load because the resin remove some bicarbonate or bicarbonate precursor (mainly short chain fatty acid ) from the body and replaces with chloride. Each molecule of chloride contributed to the body in equivalent to a molecule of hydrochloric acid added to the body, so the tendency of patients on long term haemodialysis to acidosis is inevitably increased when they take Sevelamer hydrochloride (Kidney Int., 2005;67: 776-777)<br>
This problem can be countered by an increase in the dialysate concentration of bicarbonate used in each dialysis session. But a more fundamental solution, suitable for both dialyzed and no-dialyzed patients, would be the administration of Sevelamer free base, or any other suitable resin, not as the chloride but as body suitable counterion such<br><br><br>
as bicarbonate. Anion exchange resins have traditionally been synthesized in the chloride form, but the chloride in the current Sevelamer preparation is of no benefit to patients with renal failure. A change in the formulation of Sevelamer from its current chloride form to Sevelamer attached to bicarbonate would convert an acid load into a mild alkali load. (Cli. Sci. 1963; 24:187-200)<br>
US 6858203 relates to phosphate-binding polymers provided for removing phosphate from the gastrointestinal tract. These polymers are useful for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia.<br>
WO 2006/050315 describes pharmaceutical compositions comprising a carbonate salt of an aliphatic amine polymer wherein the monovalent anion can prevent or ameliorate acidosis, in particular acidosis in patients with renal disease.<br>
HPLC Ion Chromatography PA method is used for the determination of PBC of Sevelamer HC1 which can be adopted for determining the carbonate content from Sevelamer carbonate (J R Mazzeo et al, J. Pharm. Biomed. Anal. 19 (1999) 911-915)<br>
Our co-pending application number 1402/MUM/2006 dated 1 September 2006 discloses process for preparation of Sevelamer HC1 having phosphate binding capacity in the range of about 5.0 meq/gm to about 6.0 meq/gm and chloride content in the range of about 4.5 to about 5.5 meq/gm.<br>
Although prior art mentioned above discussed advantages of Sevelamer carbonate over Sevelamer hydrochloride, however there is no process disclosed in the prior art for the preparation of Sevelamer carbonate. Thus there remains need for commercially viable and industrially useful process for the preparation of Sevelamer carbonate having consistency in phosphate binding capacity, degree of cross linking and carbonate content.<br>
Object of Invention:<br>
An object of the present invention process is to provide process for preparation of Sevelamer carbonate.<br><br><br>
Another object of present invention is to provide simple process for preparation of Sevelamer carbonate having consistency in carbonate content and phosphate binding capacity.<br>

Detailed description of the invention:<br>
The present invention provides process for the preparation of Sevelamer carbonate. According to one embodiment Sevelamer carbonate is prepared by reacting Sevelamer base with with a suitable carbonate source.<br>
Sevelamer base used is prepared by neutralizing Sevelamer hydrochloride in presence of base. The base used is sodium hydroxide which can be used in solid or in solution form. Any remaining excess base and unwanted salt formed during process can be removed by<br><br>
repeated washing of final insoluble polymer with sufficient quantity of water under vigorous stirring.<br>
Preferably, Sevelamer base is suspended in purified water at atmospheric pressure and combined with suitable carbonate source followed by vigorous stirring to get fine dispersion of aqueous phase during the reaction. The obtained carbonate polymer cake is washed with water to remove inorganic salts and the wet cake is dried on rotary evaporator or in Fluidised Bed Dryer at an elevated temperature preferably at 60-90° C. The carbonate source used is selected from carbon dioxide gas, carbonic acid prepared in situ by dissolving carbon dioxide gas in water, by using dry ice for gas generation and alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salts such as sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, calcium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate and the like. The reaction is represented by the following reaction scheme 1:<br><br><br>
According to another embodiment of the invention process to manufacture Sevelamer carbonate comprises treating the polyallylamine hydrochloride with base in presence of suitable solvent. The inorganic salts formed during the synthesis of polyallylamine base is separated by filtration. Solvent is distilled out from the filtrate and the sticky polymeric mass is dissolved in water and carbon dioxide gas is purged under pressure or at atmospheric pressure to get polyallylamine carbonate. The aqueous solution of polyallylamine carbonate is poured into suitable solvent to get the solid. The separated solid is filtered and the wet cake is dried at an elevated temperature. The polyallylamine carbonate is crosslinked by partially neutralizing with base either solid or as aqueous solution in suitable solvent in presence of dispersing agent like sorbitane trioleate (SPAN-85). The carbonate polymer cake is washed with water to remove inorganic salts and the wet cake is dried on rotary evaporator or in Fluidised Bed Dryer at an elevated temperature preferably at 60-90°C. The reaction is represented by the following reaction scheme 2:<br><br><br>
In another embodiment of the present invention process for preparation of Sevelamer carbonate comprises converting allylamine to its carbonate salt by treating into an aqueous solution of allylamine with suitable carbonate source.<br>
The aqueous solution of allylamine carbonate is subjected to polymerization in presence of suitable polymerizing agent under inert atmosphere. The aqueous solution of polyallylamine carbonate is added to a suitable solvent to get the solid which is filtered. The polyallylamine carbonate is partially neutralized with base and suspended in suitable solvent in presence of dispersing agent. The suspension is heated to elevated temperature of about 40°C to about 150°C, preferably 55 to 60°C followed by treatment with crosslinking agent maintaining elevated temperature till cross linking is complete. The reaction mixture is cooled at 25° to 35°C and filtered. The polymer gel is added in organic solvent and filtered. The carbonate polymer cake is washed with water to remove inorganic salts and drying the wet cake on rotary evaporator or in Fluidised Bed Dryer at an elevated temperature preferably at 50-95° C to remove any moisture present.<br>
The base is used in an amount of 65 to 70 mole % by weight of polyallylamine carbonate.<br>
The dispersing agent used is selected from trioleate surfactants, preferably sorbitane trioleate ( SPAN-85). Suitable solvent used can be selected from aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon. Aromatic hydrocarbon is selected from benzene, toluene, xylene, chlorobenzene, nitrobenzene and the like or the mixtures thereof.<br>
The crosslinking agent is used in the range of about 5 % to about 12 % by weight of Polyallylamine carbonate.<br>
The organic solvent used in crosslinking is selected from acetone, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, butanol or mixtures thereof.<br>
