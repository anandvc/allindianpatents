				<td>This invention relates to the activation of hafnium-based metallocene catalyst<br>
components.<br>
Polyolefins such as polyethylenes having a high molecular weight generally have<br>
improved mechanical properties over their low molecular weight counterparts.<br>
It has been observed that hafnium-based metallocene catalyst components can be<br>
used in catalyst systems that produce homo- and co-polymers of alpha-olefins<br>
having very high molecular weight. They also have an excellent response to<br>
hydrogen. Their activity is however prohibitively low.<br>
Until recently the low activity of the hafnium-based metallocene catalyst systems was<br>
believed to be inherent to the metal property. Recently, Rieger et al (Rieger B., Troll<br>
C, and Preuschen J., in Macromolecules 2002, 35, 5742-5743) or Preuschen et al.<br>
in US-A-2003/0187158 have shown that the activity of some "dual-site" hafnium-<br>
based metallocene catalyst systems may be improved when borates are used as<br>
activating agents and when the solvent is propene. These same catalyst systems,<br>
when used with methylaluminoxane (MAO) show a very low activity. It was thus<br>
concluded from these studies that MAO is an inefficient activating agent for hafnium-<br>
based catalyst systems.<br>
There is thus a need to improve the activity of the metallocene catalyst systems<br>
comprising hafnium-based catalyst components.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to improve the activity of the metallocene<br>
catalyst systems comprising hafnium-based catalyst components.<br><br>
It is also an aim of the present invention to provide polyolefins having an improved<br>
high molecular weight fraction.<br>
It is a further aim of the present invention to provide the use of a hafnium-based<br>
metallocene catalyst component to prepare polyolefins with improved mechanical<br>
properties<br>
Accordingly, the present invention discloses an active catalyst system<br>
comprising:<br>
-	a hafnium-based catalyst component;<br>
-	an activating agent having a low or no co-ordinating capability comprising an<br>
aluminoxane and a sterically hindered Lewis base.<br>
When an aluminoxane is used as activating agent, some amount of aluminiuml alkyl<br>
is always simultaneously and inevitably present. Surprisingly, the present inventors<br>
have identified that this aluminium alkyl is responsible for the low activity of the<br>
hafnium-based metallocene catalyst systems. It is therefore an object of the present<br>
invention to provide a method to trap the aluminium alkyl by a chemical agent that is<br>
not detrimental to the active cationic species. Such agent is a sterically hindered<br>
Lewis base.<br>
The hafnium-based metallocene components of the present invention have a<br>
structure according to formula (I):<br>
R"(CpRn)(FluR,m)HfQ2 (I)<br>
wherein<br>
-	Cp is a cyclopentadienyl ring;<br>
-	Flu is a fluorenyl ring;<br>
each R is the same or different and is hydrogen or a hydrocarbyl radical such<br>
as alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, alkylaryl or arylalkyl radical containing from 1 to 20<br>
carbon atoms or two carbon atoms are joined together to form a C4-C6 ring;<br><br>
-	each R' is the same or different and is hydrogen or a hydrocarbyl radical such<br>
as alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, alkylaryl or arylalkyl radical containing from 1 to 20<br>
carbon atoms<br>
-	R" is a structural bridge between two Cp rings;<br>
-	Q is a hydrocarbyl radical such as aryl, alkyl, alkenyl, alkylaryl or arylalkyl<br>
radical having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, a hydrocarboxy radical having from<br>
1 to 20 carbon atoms or a halogen and can be the same or different from<br>
each other;<br>
-	n is an integer from 0 to 4 and m is an integer from 0 to 8 .<br>
By substituted, it is meant that any of the positions on the cyclopentadienyl or on the<br>
fluorenyl derivative may comprise a substituent in place of a hydrogen atom.<br>
The type of bridge present between the ligands in the present catalyst component is<br>
not particularly limited. Typically R" comprises an alkylidene group having from 1 to<br>
20 carbon atoms, a germanium group (e.g. a dialkyl germanium group), a silicon<br>
group (e.g. a dialkyl silicon group), a siloxane group (e.g. a dialkyl siloxane group),<br>
an alkyl phosphine group or an amine group. Preferably, the substituent on the<br>
bridge comprises a hydrocarbyl radical having at least one carbon, such as a<br>
substituted or unsubstituted ethylenyl radical, for example -CH2-CH2- (Et). Most<br>
preferably R" is Ph2C, Et or Me2Si.<br>
Q is preferably a halogen and most preferably it is CI.<br>
The substituent or substituents present on the ligands are not particularly limited. If<br>
there is more than one substiutent, they can be the same or different. Typically, they<br>
are independently selected from a hydrocarbyl group having from 1 to 20 carbon<br>
atoms.<br>
The position of the substituent or substituents on the ligands is not particularly<br>
limited. The ligands may thus have any substitution pattern including unsubstituted<br>
or fully substituted. However, the cyclopentadienyl group is preferably substituted in<br><br>
the 3- and/or 5- positions or in the 2- and/or 4- positions. The fluorenyl group is<br>
preferably unsubstituted. If substituted, the substituents are preferably in the 3-<br>
and/or 6- positions or in the 2- and/or 7- positions. In this description, position 1<br>
denotes the position on the cyclopentadienyl group that is attached to the bridge.<br>
The type and position of the substituents is determined by the properties sought in<br>
the resulting polymer. If a syndiotactic polyolefin is desired, the substituents are<br>
selected to confer Cs symmetry to the catalyst component, whereas a C1 or a C2<br>
substitution pattern is selected when isotactic polyolefins are desired.<br>
In another embodiment according to the present invention, the hafnium catalyst<br>
component may be described by the formula II<br><br>
wherein R", Cp, R' and Q have already been defined and wherein X is an hetero<br>
atom ligand with one or two lone pair electrons and selected from the group 15 or 16.<br>
Preferably, X is nitrogen, phosphorus oxygen or sulphur and it can be substituted or<br>
unsubstituted.<br>
Preferably the metallocene component is a bridged cyclopentadienyl-fluorenyl<br>
complex, more preferably it has Cs or C1 symmetry substitution pattern.<br>
When Cs symmetry is desired, both the cyclopentadienyl and the fluorenyl groups<br>
are preferably unsubstituted.<br>
When a C1 symmetry is desired, the preferred substituent on the cyclopentadienyl is<br>
a in a position distal to the bridgehead position, most preferably it is a methyl or tert-<br>
butyl in position 3. The fluorenyl is preferably unsubstituted.<br>
The activating agent has low or no coordinating capability and comprises an<br>
aluminoxane and a sterically hindered Lewis base or a compound comprising one or<br>
more Lewis basic functionalities. Low coordination capability means that the<br><br>
compound can bind to the metal but is easily displaced by the olefn in the process of<br>
polymerisation. The aluminium alkyl that is inevitably associated with the<br>
aluminoxane is an electron captor (Lewis acid) and it is neutralised by the addition of<br>
an electron donor. The electron donor must be sufficiently bulky not to interfere with<br>
the hafnium.<br>
The aluminoxanes are well known and preferably comprise oligomeric linear and/or<br>
cyclic alkyl aluminoxanes represented by the formula:<br><br>
for oligomeric, linear aluminoxanes and<br><br>
for oligomeric, cyclic aluminoxane,<br>
wherein n is 1-40, preferably 10-20, m is 3-40, preferably 3-20 and R is a C1-C8 alkyl<br>
group and preferably methyl.<br>
The sterically hindered Lewis base or the compound comprising one or more Lewis<br>
basic functionalities can be selected from compounds of formula<br><br>
or of formula<br><br>
wherein G is a group 15 or 16 element of the periodic Table, b is equal to the<br>
coordination number of G, E is a group 14 or 15 element of the periodic Table, a is<br>
the coordination number of E, c is an integer from 1 to 4, at most equal to a and each<br>
R* is independently a hydrogen or an unsubstituted or substituted hydrocarbyl.<br><br>
Dimeric, trimeric, tetrameric or oligomeric versions of these compounds may also be<br>
used.<br>
Suitable compounds that can be used in the present invention are N,N-<br>
dimethylaniline, ethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, triphenylamine,<br>
triphenylphosphine, hexamethylphosphorus triamide, diethylether, ethanol, phenol,<br>
thiophenol, 2,6-di-t-butyl-4-methylphenol, tetraethoxysilane, phenyltriethoxysilane,<br>
diphenyldiethoxysilane, triphenylethoxysilane, diethyldiethoxysilane.<br>
Preferably, the Lewis base added to the aluminoxane in order to trap the aluminium<br>
alkyl is a sterically hindered or multi-substituted phenol.<br>
The aluminoxane and Lewis base are mixed together and left to react for a period of<br>
time of from 30 minutes to 2 hours, preferably about one hour in order to reach<br>
equilibrium.<br>
The amount of aluminoxane added provides a ratio Al/Hf of from 100 to 5000,<br>
preferably of from 500 to 2000.<br>
The productivity of the catalyst system is critically dependent upon the mole ratio R<br>
of Lewis base over total aluminium (aluminoxane + aluminium alkyl). Preferably R<br>
ranges from 0.5 to 0.9, more preferably from 0.55 to 0.75. If the amount of Lewis<br>
base is too large it may act as a poison.<br>
The productivity of the hafnocene-based catalyst system according to the present<br>
invention is improved by a factor of at least 20.<br>
The invention also provides a method for homo- or co-polymerising olefins that<br>
comprises the steps of:<br>
A. providing a catalyst system comprising a hafnium-based catalyst component,<br>
an activating agent comprising an aluminoxane and a sterically hindered<br>
Lewis base, and an optional support;<br><br>
B.	introducing the catalyst system in a polymerisation zone containing an olefin<br>
monomer and an optional co-monomer;<br>
C.	maintaining the reaction zone under polymerisation conditions;<br>
D.	extracting the desired polyolefin.<br>
The catalyst system may be employed in a solution polymerisation process, which is<br>
homogeneous, or a slurry process, which is heterogeneous. In a solution process,<br>
typical solvents include hydrocarbons having from 4 to 7 carbon atoms such as<br>
heptane, toluene or cyclohexane. In a slurry process it is necessary to immobilise<br>
the catalyst system on an inert support, particularly a porous solid support such as<br>
talc, inorganic oxides and resinous support materials such as polyolefins. Preferably,<br>
the support material is an inorganic oxide in its finely divided form.<br>
Suitable inorganic oxide materials that may be employed in accordance with this<br>
invention include group IIA, IIIA, IVA, or IVB metal oxides such as silica, alumina and<br>
mixtures thereof. Other inorganic oxides that may be employed either alone or in<br>
combination with the silica, or alumina are for example magnesia, titania or zirconia.<br>
Other suitable support materials comprise for example finely divided functionalised<br>
polyolefins such as finely divided polyethylene.<br>
Preferably, the support is a silica support having a specific surface area of from 200<br>
to 700 m2/g and a pore volume of from 0.5 to 3 ml/g.<br>
Alternatively, a fluorinated activating support may be used.<br>
The order of addition of the catalyst components and activating agent to the support<br>
material can vary. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the activating agent dissolved in a suitable inert hydrocarbon solvent is<br>
added to the support material slurried in the same or another suitable hydrocarbon<br>
liquid and thereafter the catalyst components are added to the slurry.<br><br>
Preferred solvents include mineral oils and the various hydrocarbons which are<br>
liquid at reaction temperature and which do not react with the individual ingredients.<br>
Illustrative examples of the useful solvents include the alkanes such as pentane, iso-<br>
pentane, hexane, heptane, octane and nonane, cycloalkanes such as cyclopentane,<br>
cyclohexane, and aromatics such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and<br>
diethylbenzene.<br>
Preferably, the support material is slurried in toluene and the catalyst components<br>
and activating agent are dissolved in toluene prior to addition to the support material.<br>
The conditions employed for polymerisation are not particularly limited, provided they<br>
are sufficient to effectively polymerise the particular monomer used as a starting<br>
material. Polymerisation may take place in the presence of hydrogen and of an<br>
alkene co-monomer such as 1-butene or 1-hexene.<br>
Optionally, pre-polymerisation can be carried out.<br>
Preferably the alpha-olefin is propylene.<br>
List of Accompaning Figures.		<br>
Figure 1 represents schemes describing the formation of internal and terminal<br>
vinilydene unsaturations in a growing polymer chain.<br>
Figure 2 represents the 1H NMR spectra of polypropylene samples prepared with<br>
Me2C(3-tBu-Cp)(Flu)MCI2 wherein M is Zr (2a) or Hf (2b)<br>
Examples.<br>
Polymerisation of propylene with Ph2C(Cp)(Flu)MCI2<br><br>
Metal M was selected as Zr and Hf respectively. All polymerisation reactions were<br>
carried out at a temperature of 50 °C and with a 0.4M solution of C3H6 in toluene.<br>
The activating agents were respectively methylaluminoxane (MAO) or a mixture<br>
MAO/phenol. When MAO was used as activating agent, the ratio [AI]/[M] was of<br>
1.103 and when the mixture MAO/phenol was used as activating agent, the ratio<br>
[AI]/[M] was of (1.0 to 1.5).103 and the ratio [phenol]/[AI] was of 0.6, wherein [Al]<br>
represents the total amount of aluminium. The results are displayed in Table I, they<br>
include the productivities expressed in kgPP/{[C3H6]*molHf*h} and polymer properties<br>
of active site enantioselectivity o, fractional abundance of skipped insertions PSK and<br>
viscosity-average molecular mass Mv determined in tetralin at 135 °C.<br><br>
It can be seen that the addition of phenol to MAO increases the productivity of both<br>
catalyst systems, but the effect was dramatically larger for Hf-based catalyst system<br>
than for Zr- based catalyst system. The molecular weight of polypropylene prepared<br>
with the hafnium-based catalyst system activated with the mixture MAO/phenol was<br>
also considerably larger than that prepared with the zirconium-based catalyst<br>
system, all other polymerisation parameters being the same.<br><br>
Polymerisation of propylene with Me2C(3-R-Cp)(Flu)MCI2.<br>
A first set of polymerisations was carried out with metal M selected as hafnium and<br>
with substituent R on the cyclopentadienyl selected as methyl and tert-butyl<br>
respectively. All polymerisation reactions were carried out at a temperature of 50 °C<br>
and with a 0.4 M solution of propene in toluene. When MAO was used as activating<br>
agent, the ratio [AI]/[M] was of 7.102 and when the mixture MAO/phenol was used as<br>
activating agent the ratio [AI]/[M] was of 6.102 and the ratio [phenol]/[AI] was of 0.6.<br>
The results are reported in Table II.<br><br>
Additional polymerisations were carried out with metal M selected as hafnium or<br>
zirconium and with substituent R on the cyclopentadienyl ring selected as methyl.<br>
The polymerisation temperature and propene partial pressure were selected as<br>
indicated in Table III. The polymer properties of enantioselectivity at site i, Oi (i = 1 or<br>
2), of conditional probability Pij of monomer insertion at site j after a previous<br>
insertion at site i (i = 1 or 2 and j = 1 or 2) are also displayed in Table III. In all<br>
polymerisation reactions, the catalyst system was activated with a mixture<br>
MAO/phenol having a ratio [phenol]/[AI] of 0.6.<br><br><br>
At a polymerisation temperature of 25 °C, the polymers obtained all had a<br>
hemiisotactic-like structure and they all exhibited a weak tendency of the growing<br>
chain to back skip to the less hindered coordination site upon diluting the monomer.<br>
The enantioselectivity of the more open coordination site was lower for the<br>
hafnocene (95 %) than for the zirconocene (98 %) and it was not sensitive to<br>
monomer concentration.<br>
At a polymerisation temperature of 50 °C, the enantioselectivity of the more open<br>
coordination site decreased with decreasing monomer concentration for the<br>
hafnocene, whereas it remained unaltered for the zirconocene.<br>
Without wishing to be bound by a theory, this behaviour might be the result of<br>
growing chain epimerisation.<br><br>
The present inventors have reported in European patent application EP-03102060<br>
that the catalyst systems based on catalyst component Me2C(3-tBu-Cp)(Flu)ZrCl2<br>
generated polypropylene with an unprecedently high level of internal chain<br>
unsaturations. These internal chain unsaturations were attributed to β-H elimination<br>
followed by allylic chain activation as summarised in Figure 1.<br>
The hafnocenes of the present invention did not exhibit the tendency to produce<br>
internal unsaturations. Their NMR spectrum indicated on the contrary a majority of<br>
terminal unsaturations. The 1H NMR spectra in the olefinic region of 400 MHz were<br>
recorded for the polymer samples prepared in toluene with Me2C(3-'Bu-Cp)(Flu)MCl2<br>
wherein M is Zr or Hf. They are represented in Figures 2a and 2b respectively. It<br>
can be seen from these spectra that the samples prepared with the zirconocene (2a)<br>
have truly internal vinylidene unsaturations, whereas those prepared with the<br>
hafnocene (2b) show the two peaks characteristic of terminal vinylidene<br>
unsaturations and additionally a complex pattern at 5.0-5.1 ppm that could represent<br>
a terminal vinyl.<br><br>

ABSTRACT<br>
A METALLOCENE CATALYST SYSTEM. METHOD FOR ITS PREPARATION<br>
AND METHOD FOR POLYMERISING ALPHA-OLEFINS USING THE SAME<br>
A metallocene catalyst system comprising: a) a hafnium-based metallocene catalyst<br>
component described by formula I<br>
R"(CpR4)(FIuR'8)Hf Q2 (I)<br>
wherein Cp is a cyclopentadienyl ring; Flu is a fluorenyl ring; each R is the same or<br>
different and is hydrogen or a hydrocarbyl radical such as alkyl, alkenyl, aryl,<br>
alkylaryl or arylalkyl radical containing from 1 to 20 carbon atoms or two carbon<br>
atoms are joined together to form a C4-C6 ring; each R' is the same or different and is<br>
hydrogen or a hydrocarbyl radical such as alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, alkylaryl or arylalkyl<br>
radical containing from 1 to 20 carbon atoms; R" of formula (I) is a structural bridge<br>
between two Cp rings; Q is a hydrocarbyl radical such as aryl, alkyl, alkenyl, alkylaryl<br>
or arylalkyl radical having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, a hydrocarboxy radical having<br>
from 1 to 20 carbon atoms or a halogen and can be the same or different from each<br>
other;<br>
or by the formula II<br>
R"(FluR'm)X Hf Q2 (II)<br>
wherein Flu, R' and Q have already been defined and wherein X is an hetero atom<br>
ligand with one or two lone pair electrons and selected from the group 15 or 16,<br>
substituted or unsubstituted, m is an integer from 0 to 8, and structural bridge R" of<br>
formula (II) is between Flu and X; b) an activating agent having a low or no coordinating<br>
 capability such as herein described comprising an aluminoxane and a<br>
sterically hindered lewis base such as herein described; c) optionally a support. The<br>
invention also relates to a method for preparing the said metallocene catalyst system<br>
and a method for polymerising alpha-olefins using the metallocene catalyst system.<br></td>
