DESCRIPTION "Endoluminal prosthesis" [0001]. The object of the present invention is an endoluminal prosthesis to be used in passages or ducts of a human body, such as to restore the passage in blood vessels narrowed or occluded by diseases such as a stenosis, in bile ducts or other similar organs of living bodies.<br>
[0002]. The present invention also relates to such type of endoluminal prosthesis which are self-expanding, e.g. made of superelastic or shape memory materials such as Nitinol.<br>
[0003] . The present invention also relates to an endoluminal prosthesis provided with means for a prompt location thereof, e.g. by radioscopy.<br>
[0004]. Endoluminal prosthesis, i.e. stents, particularly of the self-expanding type, are known for example by US-A-4665771, US-A-4665905, US-A-4925445 or EP-A-0928606.<br>
[0005] . These endoluminal prosthesis, though being acceptable in many respects, particularly for their great flexibility and resilience, which enable them to be easily positioned in narrow and tortuous passages in their collapsed state, in some cases they are not sufficiently suitable, when expanded, to support the<br><br>
development  of  a  collapsed  endoluminal  prosthesis according to a further embodiment;<br>
[0023].  Figure 12 is a view of a detail of the prosthesis from figure 11, when expanded; [0024] .   Figures 13 and 14 are perspective views of a detail of the prosthesis from Figure 1 when expanded, wherein the stress condition and the corresponding strain condition are highlighted;<br>
[0025] . Figures 15 and 16 are perspective views of a detail of the prosthesis from figure 7 when expanded, wherein the stress condition and the corresponding strain condition are highlighted;<br>
[0026] â€¢ Figures 17 and 18 are perspective views of a detail of the prosthesis from figure 9 when expanded, wherein the stress condition and the corresponding strain condition are highlighted;<br>
[0027] . Figures 19 and 20 are a perspective view of a detail of the prosthesis from figure 11 when expanded, wherein the stress condition and the corresponding strain condition are highlighted;<br>
[0028]. Figures 21 to 26 are views of six expansion steps of the prosthesis from Figure 1.<br>
[0029]. With reference to the above mentioned figures, with 500 has been indicated an endoluminal prosthesis as a whole, such as a prosthesis of the self-expanding type<br><br>
for ducts or vessels of living bodies, such as blood vessels and bile ducts or gastro-intestinal ducts or similar.<br>
[0030] . In accordance with a general embodiment of the present invention, the endoluminal prosthesis comprises a tubular body 502 suitable to turn from a collapsed condition to an expanded or partially expanded condition. [0031] . By ^collapsed condition" is meant a state of the prosthesis as being contracted such as to have a smaller bulk than in an operating use condition, e.g. a condition where the tubular body 502 has a smaller size or outer diameter than in an operating use condition. For example, the prosthesis is arranged in a collapsed condition when it is either accommodated or arranged on a transport and delivery device suitable to travel along a duct or vessel to the area to be treated. For example, in the case of a self-expanding prosthesis, this is accommodated in a sheath such as to be maintained in the collapsed condition (Figure 4 and 21) .<br>
[0032] . By expanded or partially expanded condition" is meant a condition where the prosthesis is free from restrictions or an operating use condition with the prosthesis being widened upon pressure contact against the inner surfaces of a duct or vessel walls (figures 1,6 and 26 where it is illustrated with an expanded and a<br><br>
partially expanded length) .<br>
[0033]. The tubular body 502 develops along a longitudinal axis 504.<br>
[0034]. By "longitudinal axis" is meant for example either a symmetry axis of a cylindrical body or the stretch axial direction of a tubular body. [0035] . The tubular body 502 comprises a plurality of serpentines 506a, 506b, 506c, or closed meander paths, developing along a substantially circumpherential direction.<br>
[0036] .   By "serpentine" is meant a zig-zag/to-and-fro developing element around a main direction of stretching. [0037].  Each of these serpentines comprising either arm port ions  or  arms  510  of predetermined  length  600 transversal to their main longitudinal stretch.. [0038] .   Each of said serpentines 506a,  506b,  506c comprises either bended portions or bends 512, which join two subsequent arms 510 to form said meander path. [0039].  Advantageously, at least a bridge 514a, 514b of a main  longitudinal  stretch  connects  two  adjacent serpentines 506a and 506b or 506b and 506c or 506c and 505b.<br>
[0040]. With further advantage, the bends 512 facing an adjacent serpentine 506b or 506c are circumpherentially staggered 620 relative to the opposite bends 512 of the<br><br>
adjoining serpent in 506b or 506c, both, when the prosthesis is collapsed and when the prosthesis is expanded or partially expanded.<br>
[0041] . Preferably, the at least one bridge 514a and 514b connecting adjacent serpentines 506a and 506b or 506b and 506c or 506c and 506b stretches substantially straight.<br>
[0042]. Advantageously, the at least one bridge 514a and 514b has a length 602 transversal to its main longitudinal direction which has a greater value than the length 600 of arms 510.<br>
[0043] . According to a possible embodiment, an endoluminal prosthesis 500 comprises a tubular body 502 developing along a longitudinal axis 504. The tubular body comprises a plurality of serpentines or meander paths 506a, 506b, 506c preferably closed, which develop according to a circumpherential direction 508 relative to the direction of the longitudinal axis of the endoluminal prosthesis. The circumpherential direction 508 is illustrated in Figure 4a with reference to the perspective view of the prosthesis in a closed configuration and in figure 3 and 5 with reference to the plane development of the tubular body 502 of the prosthesis in a closed configuration. [0044] .  A serpentine comprises arms 510 connected by<br><br>
bends 512. According to a possible embodiment, the arms are substantially straight.<br>
[0045]. In accordance with a possible embodiment, the arms are connected by bends such as to form a sequence of peaks and valleys along the circumpherential direction of the corresponding serpentines. With reference to an end portion of a prosthesis such as illustrated in figure 1 or 5, for simplicity of exposition those bends being convex towards the outside of the prosthesis will be identified as peaks 516a and those bends being concave towards the outside of the prosthesis, i.e. moving away from a middle axis 524, will be identified as valleys 516b.<br>
[0046]. Two adjacent serpentines are connected by at least one bridge 514a, 514b thus forming at least two cells between both adjacent serpentines. With *cell* is meant a closed periphery defined by a length of a first serpentine, a first connecting bridge, a length of a second serpentine adjacent to the first one (with the path developing in the opposite way along the circumpherential direction) and a second connecting bridge immediately next to the first one.<br>
[0047]. With references 518a and 518b there have been represented two different cells and the perimeters or areas thereof have been outlined.<br><br>
[0048] . According to a possible embodiment, the plurality of serpentines comprise a first serpentine 506a, a second serpentine 506b and a third serpentine, 506c. Preferably, the second serpentine 506b and the third serpentine 506c repeat alternatively along the longitudinal axis. Still more preferably, the second serpentine and the third serpentine are substantially identical. Furthermore, they can be arranged specularly relative to a circumpherential direction 520 intermediate between both serpentines. With reference to the embodiment illustrated in the figures, the second and third serpentines can be arranged specularly relative to a circumpherential direction 520 intermediate between both serpentines and staggered to one another along the circumpherential direction.<br>
[0049] . In accordance with one embodiment, said at least one bridge 514 is joined with a bend 512 of a serpentine 506a or 506b or 506c and with a bend 512 of an opposite serpentine 506b or 506c or 506a. [0050] . Advantageously, the at least one bridge 514a and 514b has a substantially constant width 602 all along its longitudinal stretch. Preferably, the at least one bridge 514a, 514b has a width 602 substantially equal to twice the width 600 of arms 510. With a further advantage, the at least one bridge 514a and 514b has<br><br>
substantially straight edges. In other words, a bridge<br>
514a, 514b extends without forming any bend, or folds,<br>
between a connecting or joint portion thereof to a first<br>
serpentine and a second connecting or joint portion<br>
thereof to a second serpentine.<br>
[0051].   In accordance with one embodiment, at least one<br>
bridge 514a, 514b is comprised between all the adjacent<br>
serpentines 506a, 506b and 506c.<br>
[0052].  Advantageously, a plurality of bridges 514a,<br>
514b is comprised between adjacent serpentines 506a and<br>
506b or 506b and 506c or 506c and 506b.<br>
[0053].   In accordance with one embodiment, between at<br>
least two adjacent serpentines 506a and 506b or 506b and<br>
506c or 506c and 506b a bridge 514b is provided every<br>
four bends 512 as counted along the path    of each<br>
serpentine.<br>
[0054].   In  accordance  with  a  further  embodiment,<br>
between at least two adjacent  serpentines 506a and 506b<br>
or 506b and 506c or 506c and 506b a bridge 514b is<br>
provided every six bends 510 as counted along the path<br>
of each serpentine.<br>
[0055].   In accordance with a still further embodiment,<br>
between at least two adjacent serpentines 506a and 506b<br>
or 506b and 506c or 506c and 506b a bridge 514b is<br>
provided every ten bends 510 as counted along the path<br><br>
of each serpentine.<br>
[0056] .  Advantageously, the at least one bridge 514a<br>
and 514b develops according to a direction 606 tangential<br>
to the tubular body 502 and biased relative to an axis<br>
604 parallel to the longitudinal axis 504 of said body<br>
(for example by an angle designated with the reference a<br>
or b) .<br>
[0057].   Preferably, all the bridges 514b between at<br>
least two adjacent serpentines 506b and 506c are parallel<br>
to one another.<br>
[0058].   In accordance with one embodiment, by going<br>
through the prosthesis 500 in a longitudinal way, e.g.<br>
from a first proximal end to a second distal end of the<br>
prosthesis, one encounter bridges 514b alternating with<br>
one another with opposite way direction biases (a and b)<br>
relative to an axis 604 parallel to the longitudinal axis<br>
of the tubular body.<br>
[0059].   Advantageously, by going through the prosthesis<br>
500 in a longitudinal way, one encounters the bridges<br>
514b alternating with one another with direction biases<br>
a, b of opposite value (*a" having the same value as and<br>
opposite way to *b") relative to an axis 604 parallel to<br>
the longitudinal axis of the tubular body.<br>
[0060].   In  accordance  with  one  embodiment,  the<br>
prosthesis  comprises a  cell  518a,  518b  comprising<br><br>
opposite lengths of two adjoining serpentines 506a and<br>
506b or 506b and 506c or 506c and 506b comprised between<br>
two subsequent bridges 514a, 514b, and said subsequent<br>
bridges 514a and 514b forming a closed path (such as<br>
indicated by dotted line 518b in Figure 2) .<br>
[0061].   In accordance with one embodiment, the arms 510<br>
are substantially straight.  In other words,  an arm<br>
extends without forming any bend, or fold, between a<br>
connecting or joint portion thereof to a first bend 512<br>
and a second connecting or joint portion thereof to a<br>
second bend 512.<br>
[0062] â™¦  Advantageously,   the  arms   510   comprise<br>
substantially straight edges.<br>
[0063].   In accordance with one embodiment, at least one<br>
cell 518b comprises six complete bends 512.<br>
[0064].   In accordance with a further embodiment, at<br>
least one cell 518b comprises ten complete bends 512.<br>
[0065].   In accordance with a still further embodiment,<br>
at least one cell 518b comprises eighteen complete bends<br>
512.<br>
[0066].   Advantageously, according to one embodiment, at<br>
least one prosthesis 500 length, when being in a<br>
collapsed state, comprises a plurality of serpentines<br>
506b and 506c equal to one another, having corresponding<br>
bends 512, facing the same end as the prosthesis 500,<br><br>
such as the proximal end, either circumpherentially aligned with one another, or on the same axis 610 parallel to longitudinal axis 504 of tubular body 502. With further advantage, said at least one length of prosthesis is an intermediate portion of the prosthesis or, preferably, a middle length of the prosthesis 500. [0067] . In accordance with one embodiment, said prosthesis 500 is a unique body. For example, said body 502 is obtained by cutting a tubular element, preferably by laser cutting.<br>
[0068] . Advantageously, said body is made of a superelastic material. In accordance with a different embodiment, said body is made of a strain hardened pseudoelastic material. In other words, a material being in the austenitic state at room temperature (Af
[0069] . In accordance with an embodiment, said body 502 is made of a shape memory material.<br>
[0070] . Advantageously, said body is made of Nitinol, or a Ni and Ti based alloy, such as with Nickel nominal weight percentage of 55,8%.<br><br>
[0071]. For example, a material with Austenite-to-Martensite phase transition can be used that, when being in the annealed or stress-relieved state, during a heating of the same the higher temperature of the end of austenite transformation, or Af, is lower than 15 Â°C. [0072] . In accordance with one embodiment, the first serpentine 506a comprises at least one frame 521 defining a slot or housing 522. The frame 521 is arranged at a bend between two arms. Particularly, the frame 521 and the slot 522 can be arranged in place of at least two arms and one bend relative to the second or third serpentines.<br>
[0073].   According to a possible embodiment, the second serpentine and the third serpentine comprise the same number of arms and the same number of bends. [0074] .   Preferably the frame 521 and the slot 522 are arranged at the bend between two arms in place of four arms and three bends relative to the second or third serpentines. In figure 5 the arms and the bends replaced by the slot have been illustrated with a dotted line. [0075] .  Advantageously the frame 521 occupies the whole length left free by the replaced arms and bends, as measured along the circumpherential direction and when the endoluminal prosthesis is in the collapsed condition. [0076].   In accordance with a possible embodiment, the<br><br>
slot or housing 522 passes all through the thickness of the tubular body 502.<br>
[0077] . Advantageously the frame 521 is arranged in the concave part of the bend between both arms directly connected to the frame 521.<br>
[0078] . According to a possible embodiment, the prosthesis is formed as a unique body from a tubular body 502 by cutting, such as laser cutting of a cylindrical wall thereof.<br>
[0079] . Advantageously, the frame 521 is formed as a unique body in the tubular body 502 obtained by laser cutting of a cylindrical wall.<br>
[0080] . In accordance with a possible embodiment, the slot 522 has an elongated shape in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the prosthesis, preferably elliptical or rectangular with short rounded sides. Advantageously, the frame 522 has an elongated shape in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the prosthesis. Preferably the short side of frame 521 corresponding to the bend between both arms directly connected to the frame itself is substantially straight along the circumpherential direction, when considered in a plane development of the prosthesis.<br>
[0081] . Advantageously both arms directly connected to the frame 521 join to the frame itself at end points.<br><br>
[0082]. Advantageously the frame 521 comprises two elongated sides 523 having substantially the same width as the arms 510 of the prosthesis, as measured along the circumpherential direction 508, and a shorter length than the arms 510 of the prosthesis, as measured along the longitudinal direction 504 thereof.<br>
[0083]. Advantageously, a radiopaque material is provided within the slot 522, preferably melted within the slot. The radiopaque material may be any material having a greater visibility to X-rays than the material used for the prosthesis.<br>
[0084] * In the case where the prosthesis is made of a superelastic or shape memory material, such as Nitinol (or an alloy with Ni and Ti as the main part) , the radiopaque material can be selected from Tantalum, Gold, Platinum, Tungsten or other materials suitable for the purpose.<br>
[0085]. According to a possible embodiment, the first serpentine 506a housing the frame 521 is an end serpentine of the prosthesis. Advantageously, both end serpentines of the prosthesis, i.e. the first and last serpentines, comprise at least one frame 521, respectively. In other words, in a possible embodiment of the prosthesis according to the present invention, by going through the prosthesis along the longitudinal axis<br><br>
504 starting from an end of the prosthesis itself, such as a proximal end, one encounters a first serpentine or end serpentine, a sequence of alternated second and third serpentines and a last serpentine or further end serpentine, or distal end serpentine. In accordance with a possible embodiment, the last serpentine or further end serpentine specularly reproduces the first serpentine relative to a middle axis 524 of the prosthesis, possibly staggered along the circumpherential direction. [0086] . In accordance with an advantageous embodiment, the frame 522 is arranged at an end bend, i.e. a bend belonging to the end serpentine and with its concavity facing the inside of the prosthesis, i.e. the middle axis 524. In other words, the frame 521 is arranged at or in place of a peak 516a, preferably within the concavity thereof.<br>
[0087] . Considering a cell 518a comprising the frame 521 and defined between a length of the end serpentine 506a and a length of the second serpentine 506b, the frame 521 is advantageously arranged inside the respective cell.<br>
[0088] â€¢ In accordance with a possible embodiment, the frame 521 has an elongated shape in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the prosthesis and develops from the end bend towards a middle axis 524 of the endoluminal<br><br>
prosthesis.<br>
[0089]. By designating with 518a the cell defined between the first and the second serpentines and congprising the frame 521, this cell comprises two bridges 514a developing along directions 526 tangential to the tubular body. Both bridges 514a may be advantageously arranged along directions 526 substantially parallel to one another and further parallel to the development directions of the remaining bridges 514b between the first and the second serpentines!. Still more advantageously, both bridges 514a may be arranged along directions 526 incident to one another, both in a closed configuration and in an expanded configuration of the prosthesis (figures 2, 3).<br>
[0090] â€¢ In accordance with a possible embodiment, the bridges 514a belonging to the cell 518a comprising the frame 521 develop along directions 526 converging from the end of the prosthesis towards a middle axis 524 of the prosthesis itself.<br>
[0091]. In accordance with an embodiment, the bridges 514a develop according to directions 526 tangential to the tubular body and biased relative to an axis parallel to the longitudinal axis 504 of the endoluminal prosthesis. [0092].  Advantageously, the bridges 514a of cell 518a<br><br>
comprising the frame 521 develop along directions 526 tangential to the tubular body and biased relative to the longitudinal axis 504 of the endoluminal prosthesis. [0093] . In accordance with a possible embodiment, by-designating with 514b the bridges connecting the first and the second serpentines which do not belong to cell 518a comprising the frame 521, these bridges 514b are substantially parallel to at least one of the bridges 514a belonging to the cell 518a comprising the slot 522. [0094] . Advantageously, in the cell 518a comprising the frame 521, the number of arms and bends of the first serpentine length is lower than the number of arms and bends of the second serpentine length. For example in the cell 518a comprising the frame 521, the length belonging to the first serpentine may comprise at least two arms and two bends less than the arms and bends of the length belonging to the second serpentine, as specularly counted between both serpentines. In the example from figure 2, starting from one of the bridges 514a, the length of the first serpentine belonging to the cell 518a containing the slot comprises six arms and five bends while the length of second serpentine belonging to the cell 518 containing the frame 521 comprises eight arms and seven bends. [0095] .   In figure 5 is- shown a plane development of a<br><br>
possible embodiment of the endoluminal prosthesis according to the present invention.<br>
[0096]. According to a possible embodiment, such as illustrated in Figure 5, with 528 has been designated a further cell of a different shape than the cell 518a containing the frame 521 and the remaining cells 518b of the endoluminal prosthesis. For simplicity of description the further cell 528 will be indicated as the "anomalous" cell.<br>
[0097] . The anomalous cell 528 is defined between the first and second serpentines and preferably adjacent to the cell 518a containing the slot. Advantageously the anomalous cell 528 shares a bridge 514a with cell 518a containing the slot and preferably shares that bridge which develops along a direction tangential to the tubular body incident to the development directions of the remaining bridges provided between the first and the second serpentines. The "anomalous" cell comprises two arms and two bends more than the remaining cells 518b of the prosthesis. For example, the anomalous cell comprises six arms and five bends on the length relative to the second serpentine while the remaining cells 518b of the prosthesis comprise four arms and three bends, with reference to a length relative to a serpentine. 10098] .   &gt;From what has been discussed above, it should<br><br>
be appreciated that providing an endoluminal prosthesis according to the present invention allows to meet the requirement of visibility to X-rays, or however to radioscopy, of the prosthesis itself while maintaining its structure solid and avoiding that parts may protrude outside the prosthesis.<br>
[0099] . The original provision of replacing some arms and bends of the serpentine to insert the slot and the radiopaque material enables the prosthesis to deploy evenly all along the longitudinal development thereof, simplifying at the same time the manufacturing steps of the prosthesis itself.<br>
[00100] . By providing the cell comprising the frame with arms developing along directions tangential to the tubular body which are incident to one another, local distortions due to the difference in arms and bends between the serpentines can be prevented. This aspect is enhanced by the presence of the anomalous cell adjacent to the cell containing the slot.<br>
[00101] . Figure 6 illustrates a partial perspective view of the above prosthesis in a deformed configuration with reference to the end comprising the frame 521. [00102]. Figures 7, 9, 11 illustrate the plane development of respective three possible embodiments of the prosthesis according to the present invention. Figure<br><br>
7 represents an embodiment similar to that of figures 3 or 5 wherein the bridges 514a corresponding to the cell comprising the frame 521 develop along directions 526 tangential to the tubular body, biased relative to the longitudinal axis 504 and parallel to one another. These directions are further parallel to the tangential directions along which the other bridges 514b develop between the first and second serpentines. Figures 9 and 11 represent two types of prosthesis where the cells defined between the second and third serpentines are of a different configuration compared to that of the cells between the second and third serpentines of the embodiments from figures 3, 5 or 7. Furthermore, the prosthesis from figure 9 has the bridges of cell 518a containing the frame 521 that develop al ong direct ions 526 tangential to the tubular body and biased relative to the longitudinal axis and incident to one another. On the other hand, in the prosthesis from figure 11 the bridges of the cell 518a containing the frame 521 develop along directions 526 tangential to the tubular body and biased relative to the longitudinal axis and parallel to one another.<br>
[00103] â€¢ Figures 8, 10, 12 illustrate the prosthesis from figures 7, 9, 11 respectively, in an expanded or widened configuration.<br><br>
[00104]. Figures 13, 14 illustrate the stresses and strains at the frame 521 in the prosthesis from figures 3, 5, respectively. Figures 15, 16 illustrate the stresses and strains at the frame 521 in the prosthesis from figures 7, 8, respectively. Figures 17, 18 illustrate the stresses and strains at the frame 521 in the prosthesis from figures 9, 10, respectively. Figures 19, 20 illustrate the stresses and strains at the frame 521 in the prosthesis from figure 11, 12, respectively. Arrow F designates the greatest stress-strain area. The prosthesis illustrated in figures 3, 5 allows to achieve a very low stress-strain peak value, and however a more constant distribution or gradual variation of the stress state.<br>
[00105]. The above has been achieved both by the advantageous embodiment of the frame 521 to accommodate the radiopaque material and by the overal 1 synergy between the frame 521 and the overall geometry of the prosthesis.<br>
[00106] â€¢ Thanks to the prosthesis thus provided, it is possible to carry out endoluminal operations in tortuous vessels or ducts, and at the same time, an optimum and constant support of the treated vessel wall can also be ensured with the prosthesis being in the expanded state. [00107].  Figures 21 to 26 illustrate six release steps<br><br>
from a sheath 612 of a self-expanding endoluminal prosthesis 500. This procedure is, for example, carried out by withdrawing the sheath such that the prosthesis is left free to expand, such as from a housing where it is accommodated as provided in a transport and release device, such as a catheter (not shown herein) . [00108]. It should be understood that variants and/or additions may be provided to what has been described and illustrated above.<br>
[00109]. The slot can be of any shape other than that illustrated in the figures. Furthermore, it could be provided in a serpentine different from the serpentine end, or in a bend corresponding to a valley with reference to the meaning of the term ^valley* such as discussed above.<br>
[00110] â€¢ The number of serpentines, arms or bends may be changed from what has been described or illustrated. The shape of the serpentines may also be changed, particularly the alternate repetition between the second and third serpentines. For example, the second and third serpentines may be either equal, or perfectly specular without resulting staggered in the circumpherential direction.<br>
tOOlll]. Generally all the embodiments which have been described as possible above, can be made as such, in the<br><br>
absence of those characteristics described as belonging to other possible embodiments.<br>

the endoluminal prosthesis, those skilled in the art, aiming at satisfying contingent and specific needs, may carry out a number of modifications, variants and replacements of elements with others functionally equivalent, without departing from the scope of the claims below.<br><br>
