				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to an earring nut for ear-piercing devices and, also to<br>
an apparatus for piercing an ear incorporating the earring nut as well as an ear-<br>
piercing cartridge and stud gun system with a stackable packing box for the<br>
cartridge.<br>
The present invention has been divided out of Indian patent application No.<br>
IN/PCT/2002/00682.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
Ear piercing, an increasingly commonplace fashion statement, is rapidly<br>
becoming a routine procedure, often performed by laypersons without medical<br>
experience or training. Today a number of manually operated devices that allow for<br>
the safe, hygienic, user-friendly piercing of ears are available. Examples of such<br>
systems are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,496,343 issued to Reil on March 5, 1996,<br>
Application Ser. No. 292,249 filed August 18, 1994, U.S. Patent No. 5,792,170<br>
issued to Reil on August 11, 1998, Application Ser. No. 754,411 filed November<br>
21,1996, and U.S. Patent No. 5,868,774 ("the '774 Patent") issued to Reil on<br>
February 9, 1999,' Application Ser. No. 008,763 filed January 19, 1998, all of which<br>
are incorporated herein by this reference.<br>
The various ear-piercing systems that exist today essentially comprise a stud<br>
(also called an earring or a piercing earring) with a post (also called a pin or a<br>
piercing pin) and a nut (sometimes called a clasp or an earring clasp) that are<br>
mounted in an earring cartridge. During the ear piercing process, the ear is<br>
placed between the post and the nut and the cartridge is squeezed, either<br>
manually or by placing it in a stud gun, which causes the post to pierce the ear<br>
and engage the nut.<br>
From a fashion standpoint, one of the most desirable earring designs is in<br>
the form of a hoop but, heretofore, hoop earrings have not been commonly used<br>
with ear-piercing systems. By and large, the studs in use today have designs that<br>
are symmetrical about the post. A primitive hoop earring ear-piercing system is<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,004,471 ("the '471 Patent") but the disclosed<br>
design is not a fully closeable hoop thereby creating an unsightly design. The<br>
stud post (or piercing pin) is engaged by the nut (or clasp), leaving the hoop<br>
open. This is because the stud post is rigidly attached to the hoop of the stud,<br>
which implies that the hoop cannot be rotated to engage the piercing pin.<br>
Further, the open end of the hoop is not adapted to engage the piercing pin (or<br>
stud). Apart from its untoward appearance, the design disclosed in the '471<br>
Patent also poses a danger of scratching and injury to the wearer because of the<br>
open end of the hoop. Therefore, there exists a need today for a hoop earring<br>
that is fully closeable.<br>
Additionally, the existing designs for earring nuts (or clasps) are such that<br>
the open end of the stud post sticks out of the nut after the stud post is engaged<br>
by the nut. This presents a potential for injury to the wearer of the earring<br>
because the open end of the stud post can scratch the wearer's neck behind the<br>
ear. Therefore, there is a need for an improved earring nut that will remove this<br>
potential for injury.<br>
Further, the existing ear-piercing cartridges suffer from a number of<br>
drawbacks. To illustrate these drawbacks, consider the 774 Patent, which<br>
represents the state-of-the-art in ear-piercing design. The 774 Patent describes<br>
an ear-piercing apparatus that is comprised of an earring cartridge which holds<br>
an earring stud and an earring nut in two opposed jaws, i.e., an earring jaw and a<br>
nut jaw. The stud is held within a stud post holder assembly (also called<br>
"pierced-ear earring cartridge" in the Reil 774 Patent), which is a module that<br>
disassembles into two pieces. One of these pieces has a frangible and<br>
breakable tab at its rear.<br>
Although, the 774 Patent describes a simple, easy to use ear-piercing<br>
system, when it is used to pierce an ear, the two pieces of the stud post holder<br>
assembly may stay attached to the stud and, therefore, sometimes require<br>
manual removal from the earring. Even when the two pieces come off the stud,<br>
they fall out of the assembly, sometimes into the ear or onto the body of the<br>
subject whose ears are being pierced and at other times onto the floor.<br>
Moreover, the reliance of the 774 Patent on the frangible tab has design<br>
limitations. First, the breaking of the tab causes an unwanted noise that is often<br>
a source of distress or concern for the customer. Second, the use of the<br>
frangible tab leads to only discrete control over the ear-piercing process. In the<br>
invention of the 774 Patent, when the earring assembly is squeezed, either<br>
holding it in a hand or mounted in an ear-piercing gun, the presence of the<br>
frangible tab implies that once the earring assembly is squeezed to the point of<br>
breaking the tab, the ear is pierced automatically. Thus, it prevents continuous<br>
control of the exact location and timing of the ear-piercing process. Because of<br>
the lack of continuous control over the location and timing of the ear-piercing<br>
process, the technician who is piercing the ear has to use guesswork to line the<br>
stud post with the desired piercing area. This causes him to sometimes miss the<br>
exact spot that he wanted to pierce.<br>
Additionally, the ear-piercing system of the 774 Patent and its<br>
predecessors have not been designed for use with the novel hinged hoop<br>
earrings described above.<br>
Finally, the 774 Patent discloses a sterilizable blister pack for storing and<br>
transporting the earring cartridge. While such a packing is a convenient, effective<br>
sterilizable packing for the cartridge, it does not provide rigid, vertical stackable<br>
storage for earring cartridges.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a freely rotatable hinged hoop<br>
earring ear-piercing system that is closeable.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a more effective<br>
means by which ears may be pierced. In particular, the present invention seeks<br>
to provide an ear-piercing system in which the stud holding module separates<br>
from the stud cleanly after the ear is pierced. Further, the present invention<br>
provides a system whereby the components of the stud holder module remain<br>
within the earring cartridge after an ear is pierced. This eliminates the possibility<br>
of the module components falling into the ear or body of the subject being<br>
pierced or onto the floor, forcing the ear piercer to look for them following the ear<br>
piercing operation.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a higher level of<br>
accuracy for ear-piercing by means that are more controllable and more expertly<br>
handled by persons without the requirement of a high degree of training. In<br>
particular, the present invention seeks to provide an ear-piercing system that can<br>
be finely controlled by the ear-piercer whereby the ear-piercer need not commit<br>
to piercing an ear until he is certain of piercing the precise spot that he wants to.<br>
Additionally, the invention seeks to provide a safe earring nut for use with<br>
traditional style ear-piercing earrings that protects the wearer from being<br>
scratched by the open end of the stud post.<br>
It is yet another object of the present invention to provide an ear-piercing<br>
methodology that creates, protects and maintains sterile ear-piercing instruments<br>
prior to the actual piercing. It is an additional object of the present invention to<br>
provide sterilizable and sterile means by which the disposable, one-use, ear-<br>
piercing cartridges may be transported and stored in a sterile condition until<br>
ready for use. It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a<br>
sterilizable and sterile stackable packing boxes that facilitates engagement and<br>
disengagement of an earring cartridge with a stud gun and which earring<br>
cartridge is resistant to reuse to ensure that the same is not reused.<br>
It is an additional object of the present invention to provide a hand-held<br>
stud gun that can engage the earring cartridge of the invention to better control<br>
the cartridge during the ear-piercing process.<br>
These and other objects and advantages of the present invention will be<br>
apparent from a review of the following specification and accompanying drawings.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention solves the above-said problems, representing a<br>
quantum improvement in the design and operation of ear-piercing systems.<br>
The present invention provides an earring nut, comprising :<br>
a front plate having a hole to receive a stud post; and<br>
a shield aligned with the hole such that the shield forms an intervening<br>
surface between an open end of the stud post and an earring wearer;<br>
wherein the intervening surface of the shield comprises extensions from the<br>
front plate, the extensions being curved back from the front plate and having<br>
overlying ends such that a first extension end overlies a second extension end<br>
comprising the intervening surface to contact and support the second extension end<br>
when the intervening surface is contacted by the open end of the stud post and the<br>
extensions are springless elements forming a substantially stable structure when<br>
the intervening surface of the second extension end is contacted by the open end of<br>
the stud post.<br>
This invention thus provides an improved earring nut for use with the<br>
traditional ear-piercing earring. The improved nut design also ensures correct<br>
spacing between the head of the stud and the nut, preventing the nut from traveling<br>
too far down the stud post and squeezing the pierced area, which can inhibit<br>
healing.<br>
This invention also provides an improved hoop ear-piercing earring design<br>
that is fully closeable and that is hinged to allow for free rotation of the hoop.<br>
Application No. IN/PCT/2002/00687 discloses an ingenious earring cartridge<br>
system that can be adapted for use with hinged hoop earrings of the present<br>
invention as well as with traditional symmetrical ear piercing earrings and that<br>
provides for complete and instantaneous release of the cartridge assembly from<br>
the stud and nut once the ear is pierced. Additionally,the earring cartridge allows the<br>
technician to exercise continuous control over the ear-piercing process, thereby<br>
allowing him to align the stud post and the location to be pierced right up to the<br>
point of piercing. This leads to greatly increased accuracy of the ear-piercing<br>
process as compared to the prior art.<br>
Said application No. IN/PCT/2002/00687 also discloses an earring<br>
cartridge and stud gun system for providing sterile ear piercing comprising an<br>
earring cartridge carrying a stud having a post in a stud post holder assembly<br>
and a nut in slidably aligned, spaced apart, and oppositely opposed placement<br>
so that an ear part may be placed between the post and the nut for piercing<br>
wherein a torque-like force is produced on the stud post holder assembly<br>
causing the assembly to rotatably open after the earring cartridge is compressed<br>
to bring the stud towards the nut for engaging the post with the nut. The rotatable<br>
opening of the stud post holder assembly facilitates the disengagement of the<br>
assembly from the earring stud after the stud has connected to the nut,<br>
eliminating the need to touch the ears of the customer to confirm the stud-nut<br>
connection or to remove the assembly after the ear piercing is completed.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the earring cartridge comprises a nut jaw for<br>
holding the nut and an earring jaw for holding the stud post holder assembly,<br>
which carries the stud. The assembly is in two halves with each half having a<br>
front stud head adaptor, a main body and an L-shaped terminal member having<br>
a base and a leg. The terminal members ride in intermediate channels in the<br>
earring jaw and when the earring cartridge is squeezed the main body of the post<br>
holder assembly moves relative to the flexible tang, engaging it, and the bases of<br>
the terminal members slide over a hump juxtaposed with the tang.<br>
The invention also provides for convenient hygienic transport and storage of<br>
the cartridge in the form of a stackable packing box which contains a robust seal to<br>
maintain the cartridge in a sterile environment.<br>
If the invention is used with a stud gun, the earring cartridge is used by<br>
placement while loading within the cradle of the gun, the cradle receiving and<br>
removing the earring cartridge from the stackable packing box to provide and<br>
maintain the stud and the nut assembly in an aligned position for piercing the ear<br>
without any necessity of coming in direct contact with the sterile earring cartridge<br>
with the hands of the operator. After the ear is pierced, the stackable packing box<br>
can be used to unload the cartridge from the stud gun. Thus, the packing box<br>
allows the operator to load and unload the cartridge from the stud gun without<br>
touching the cartridge.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Generally, the figures show the construction and operation of the ear-<br>
piercing system of the present invention. Referring to Figure 1A, the hinged hoop<br>
earring of the present invention is comprised of a stud hoop 3 that has a first<br>
terminal 6A and a second terminal 6B. The hinged hoop earring is further<br>
comprised of stud post 1 that has a first pointed end 9 and a second end 8 that<br>
encloses a hole 5, a hinge 4 attached to the first terminal 6A of the stud hoop 3 and<br>
a latch 2 attached to the second terminal 6B of the stud hoop 3.<br>
As shown in Figure 1C, latch 2 is a V-shaped member that is adapted to<br>
receive stud post 1, which snaps into place when it is pushed into latch 2. The<br>
distance between the two arms of latch 2 is somewhat less than the diameter of<br>
stud post 1 but the arms flex when stud post 1 is pushed through them, which<br>
causes stud post 1 to snap into its resting position. The hinged hoop earring is<br>
shown in the open position in Figure 1A and in a closed position in Figure 1B. To<br>
go from the open to the closed position, latch 2 and stud post 1 are rotatably moved<br>
relative to each other around hinge 4 until stud post 1 snaps into latch 2. Figure 1C<br>
provides further details of hinge 4. Referring to Figure 1D, hinge 4 is comprised of<br>
two substantially flat vertical members 10. The second end 8 of stud post 1 is<br>
hinged between vertical members 10 by a pivot pin 7 that is received through hole 5<br>
of the stud post 1 and attached at either end to the vertical members 10 whereby<br>
stud post 1 and stud hoop 3 are free to rotate around the axis of pivot pin 7.<br>
Referring to Figure 2 earring nut (or clasp) of the invention comprises a front<br>
plate 11 that contains a hole sizeably adapted to receive stud post 1 and a shield 13<br>
aligned with the hole in the front plate such that shield 13 forms an intervening<br>
surface between open end 9 of stud post 1 and the earring wearer. Shield 13<br>
comprises extensions from the front plate, the extensions curved back from the<br>
front plate and having overlying ends such that a first extension end overlies a<br>
second extension end comprising the intervening surface to contact and support the<br>
second extension end when the intervening surface is contacted by the open end of<br>
the stud post. The first and second extensions are springless elements forming a<br>
substantially stable structure when the intervening surface of the second extension<br>
is contacted by the open end of the stud post. The second extension end further<br>
comprises a dimple for receiving the open end 9 of the stud post 1. Shield<br>
13 also prevents the nut from sliding along the stud post towards the ear,<br>
thereby maintaining enough distance between the nut and the ear to promote<br>
healing. The earring nut is for use with traditional ear-piercing earrings.<br>
Referring to Figures 3-8, the earring-cartridge-and-stud gun system of the<br>
present invention is comprised of earring-cartridge stud gun 12, and earring<br>
cartridge 14 that is preferably adaptable to fit in the cradle of stud gun 12. Figure<br>
4A depicts a vertical section through earring cartridge 14 that is loaded with a<br>
stud P and a nut N. When used with traditional-style ear-piercing earrings, nut N<br>
is generally a metallic component that may have an ornamental purpose. In this<br>
case the nut usually is left on the stud post after the ear-piercing process is<br>
completed. However, when used with hinged hoop earrings, nut N is a<br>
disposable nut usually made of a plastic material or the like. Once a subject's ear<br>
is pierced with a hinged hoop earring, the stud hoop is swung around the ear and<br>
the stud post is snapped into the latch. The disposable nut is then removed from<br>
the stud post.<br>
Initially, stud P is fitted within a stud post holder assembly 116, which is<br>
then fitted within earring cartridge 14. Earring cartridge 14 fits within cradle 74 of<br>
earring-cartridge stud gun 12 so that a person's entire hand, not just the fingers,<br>
may be used to wield and control the pierced-ear earring prior to and during the<br>
ear-piercing process. The cartridge is also provided with a plurality of ribs 180,<br>
181 on its outside surface so that the cartridge itself maybe used without the<br>
stud gun for ear piercing, if so desired.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4A, generally, earring cartridge 14 comprises a stud post<br>
holder assembly 116 for holding stud P, an earring jaw 112 for movably carrying<br>
stud post holder assembly 116, and a nut jaw 114 for alignedly holding nut N<br>
opposite stud P, nut jaw 114 having a nut jaw extension 154 for slidably<br>
engaging nut jaw 114 with earring jaw 112. The two slidably connected portions<br>
of earring cartridge 14, nut jaw 114 and earring jaw 112, are also shown in<br>
Figures 4B and 5, respectively. Nut jaw extension 154 and stud post holder<br>
assembly 116 interact to produce a torque-like force on the stud post holder<br>
assembly 116 causing it to rotatably open after earring cartridge 14 is<br>
compressed to bring earring jaw 112 towards nut jaw 114, engaging post P with<br>
nut N.<br>
Referring to Figures 5-6, stud post holder assembly 116 for holding the<br>
stud is in two halves, 113, 115 each half comprising main body 121, 123, front<br>
stud head adaptors 117, 119 attached to the front side of the body and L-shaped<br>
terminal members with legs 125, 127 and bases 204, 205 attached to the rear<br>
side of the body 121, 123. Front stud head adaptors 117, 119 are recessed to<br>
receive, in one embodiment, the stud head or, in another embodiment, the hinge<br>
of the hinged hoop earring.<br>
Stud post holder assembly 116 may be modified to accommodate the<br>
hinged hoop earring by making a through hole 1200, 1202 in the stud post holder<br>
assembly, adaptably sized to hold a hinged hoop earring stud (FIGS. 12A and<br>
1B, respectively). In one embodiment, when the stud post holder assembly is<br>
used with a hinged hoop earring, it may not include the front stud head adaptor.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, when the stud head adaptors are included for use<br>
with hinged hoop earrings, they are recessed to receive the hinge of the hinged<br>
hoop earring. Further, the top surface of the earring jaw can be provided with a<br>
radial cavity such that a stud post holder assembly carrying a hinged hoop can<br>
be accommodated in it. Enough room is provided so that a hinged hoop earring<br>
can be held within the stud post holder assembly such that the hoop can curve<br>
away from the stud (FIG. 12B) or, in an alternative arrangement, curve towards<br>
the stud (FIG. 12A).<br>
As shown in Figures 5 and 6, stud post holder assembly 116 fits within a<br>
top channel 201 of earring jaw 112. The body of each half of stud post holder<br>
assembly 116 is held within the top channel such that stud post holder assembly<br>
116 can slide in and out of earring jaw 112. A bottom channel 120 within earring<br>
jaw 112 is adapted for slidably engaging nut jaw extension 154 (see Figure 5B).<br>
Bottom channel 120 with its base 152 serves as a guidance and alignment<br>
means for nut jaw extension 154.<br>
Earring jaw 112 further comprises a nut jaw retention system comprising a<br>
bottom side 152 of earring jaw 112 adjacent the bottom channel and defining an<br>
opening 155 between an interior and an exterior of earring jaw 112. Opening 155<br>
is parallel to a length of the bottom side and extends from a rear portion of<br>
earring jaw 112 to a point just past a midpoint between the rear portion and a<br>
front portion of earring jaw 112 and accommodates an extending tongue 168<br>
with a hook coupled to nut jaw 114. When tongue 168 is introduced into opening<br>
155 the hook may travel along opening 155 and maybe caught at a forward end<br>
thereof at the point just past the midpoint.<br>
Earring jaw 112 also comprises a biasing engagement mechanism for<br>
engaging earring jaw 112 and nut jaw 114 that tends to urge earring jaw 112<br>
away from nut jaw 114. In the embodiment shown in Figure 5A, the mechanism<br>
comprises a spring post 140 which is coupled centrally to an interior rear wall of<br>
the bottom channel, and extends into the bottom channel generally parallel to a<br>
bottom side approximately one-quarter the distance between a rear and a front<br>
of earring jaw 112. A spring is disposed around the spring post 140.<br>
Additionally, earring jaw 112 comprises a plurality of ribs 180, which are<br>
present on an exterior of earring jaw 112, generally opposite the bottom channel,<br>
ribs 180 providing means by which secure manual engagement may be made of<br>
the exterior of earring jaw 112.<br>
Nut jaw 114 optionally comprises nut holding means for holding a nut<br>
corresponding to an earring post in alignment with earring post, extension means<br>
for extending the nut holding means away from earring jaw 112 and slidable<br>
engagement means for slidably engaging earring jaw 112, the slidable<br>
engagement means coupled to the extension means. As shown in Figure 4B, in<br>
a preferred embodiment, the nut holding means further comprise a nut holder<br>
191 and support means 199 for supporting the nut holder in a spaced apart<br>
relationship with extension means 154. Further, nut holder 191 may define first<br>
and second nut grooves within which an earring nut N may fit. The first nut<br>
groove 192 is perpendicular to second nut groove 193; and a finger 190, rises up<br>
from the floor of block 191 in the first groove, which is capable of engaging with<br>
slight compression a nut fitted in the first and second nut grooves whereby the<br>
nut may be securely held in place by finger 190 in the first and second grooves<br>
of the block yet easily disengaged from the block.<br>
Also, support means 199 for supporting the nut holder may comprise an<br>
upright portion 194 supporting the block away from extension means 154<br>
whereby a void is defined between the upright portion, the extension means, and<br>
earring jaw 112 to provide room for an ear, the upright portion having a width<br>
approximately the same as the width of earring jaw 112 to provide means by<br>
which nut jaw 114 may be manually engaged.<br>
As with earring jaw 112, a plurality of ribs 181 is present on an outward<br>
facing portion of upright portion 194 opposite the void, and provides means by<br>
which secure manual engagement 15 may be made of the exterior of nut jaw<br>
114.<br>
The extension means comprise a base portion which is coupled to the nut<br>
holding means. The base portion has a width approximately the same as the<br>
width of earring jaw 112 to provide means by which the nut holding means may<br>
be sturdily supported and provides a means by which nut jaw 114 may be<br>
engaged by earring jaw 112 thereby obstructing further slidable travel of nut jaw<br>
114 into earring jaw 112. Further, a neck portion is coupled to the base portion<br>
and has a width approximately the same as the width of bottom channel 120 so<br>
that the neck portion may slide into bottom channel 120. The extension means<br>
may further comprise a tongue portion 168, which extends from the neck portion<br>
and terminates in a hook. Tongue portion 168 descends at an angle from the<br>
neck portion whereby the catch may engage a terminal end of opening 155<br>
present in a bottom side of earring jaw 112.<br>
In one embodiment, the slideable engagement means comprise an<br>
elongated portion slidably engaging the interior of the bottom channel. The<br>
elongated portion may define a bore wherein the bore is defined by first and<br>
second nut jaw extension 169,170, first nut jaw extension 169 defining the upper<br>
part of the bore and the second nut jaw extension 170 defining the lower part of<br>
the bore. The first and second nut jaw extensions 169, 170 have oppositely<br>
opposed curved sections that serve to retain the biasing means within the bore<br>
and that serve to define corresponding gaps between the first and second nut<br>
jaw extensions 169, 170 and wherein the biasing means is a spring (not shown).<br>
Referring to Figure 4B, nut jaw 114 also comprises a flexible tang 160 and<br>
a hump 161 juxtaposed with flexible tang 160 such that when the rear end of the<br>
body of stud post holder assembly 116 is located ahead of the front of the<br>
flexible tang 160, bases 204,205 of the terminal members are forced up onto<br>
hump 161. The rear end of the body of the stud post holder assembly is the end<br>
that has the terminal members attached to it. The front of the tang is the end of<br>
the tang that is closest to the nut jaw in the assembled configuration of the<br>
earring cartridge.<br>
In one embodiment, the length of flexible tang 160 is shorter than that of<br>
legs 125, 127 of the terminal members. Additionally, in a preferred embodiment,<br>
flexible tang 160 is moldably attached to the hump 161. Further, hump 161 may<br>
be attached to the upper surface of nut jaw extension 169. As can be seen in<br>
Figure 4B, the invention also provides that flexible tang 160 is flared upward to<br>
engage the underside of post holder assembly 116 pushing up on said assembly<br>
in a spring-like fashion. The engagement of tang 160 with post holder assembly<br>
116 causes relative movement between assembly 116 and the earring jaw,<br>
causing body parts 121, 123 (Figure 6B) to slide out of the earring jaw after the<br>
ear is pierced. This allows the assembly 116 to open once assembly 116 moves<br>
past tang 160 because until the body parts of the assembly move out of the<br>
earring jaw, the two halves of the assembly are constrained together, holding the<br>
stud in place. Even when tang 160 is absent, the engagement of nut N with stud<br>
P causes relative movement between assembly 116 and the earring jaw causing<br>
body parts 121, 123 (Figure 7B) to slide out of the earring jaw after the ear is<br>
pierced and the nut is engaged by the stud.<br>
Referring to Figure 5A and 5B, earring jaw 112 may further comprise two<br>
intermediate channels 208 configured to adaptably receive legs 125, 127 of the<br>
terminal member of each haif of stud post holder assembly 116 whereby the legs<br>
slide within intermediate channels 208 when stud post holder assembly 116<br>
slides in and out of earring jaw 112.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the invention provides a peg and hole<br>
alignment system for the two halves of stud post holder assembly 116<br>
comprising a peg jutting out of the outer surface of one body and the other body<br>
having a cavity sized to adaptably receive the peg such that when the two halves<br>
of stud post holder assembly 116 are assembled together in alignment the peg is<br>
received within the cavity.<br>
The operation of the earring cartridge can be understood by reference to<br>
Figures 6A-6C. Normally, the earring cartridge spring or other biasing means<br>
forces the nut jaw away from the earring jaw as far as the bottom slot and the<br>
hooked tongue will allow. Ample room is provided between the nut jaw and the<br>
earring jaw for the insertion of an ear to be pierced. Once the ear is placed<br>
between the nut jaw and the earring jaw, and necessarily between earring stud<br>
or post P and earring nut N, earring cartridge 14 is compressed manually or for<br>
example, by squeezing an earring cartridge stud gun, described below, within<br>
which the earring cartridge can be placed. The compression of earring cartridge<br>
14 brings the base of L-shaped terminal members 203 over the hump causing a<br>
torque-like force to be applied on the two halves of stud post holder assembly<br>
116.<br>
At this point, if the ear piercer is satisfied and ready to pierce the ear, he<br>
firmly squeezes earring cartridge 14 (or the stud gun) causing the flexible tang to<br>
move past the back end of assembly 116, which leaves the flexible tang free to<br>
rise up and above the plane of the post holder assembly bottom. This drives<br>
earring stud or post P through the ear and into the flanged aperture and through<br>
the earring nut. In so doing, the elongated portion of the nut jaw compresses the<br>
earring cartridge spring and travels to the rear of the earring jaw.<br>
During this operation, stud post holder assembly 116 is held in place, the<br>
flexible tang (moving with the elongated nut jaw portion) moves along the bottom<br>
side of stud post holder assembly 116 until it finally reaches the back end of stud<br>
post holder assembly 116.<br>
Upon full compression of earring cartridge 14, the ear has been pierced;<br>
and earring post P has engaged nut N. Pressure is then released from the hand<br>
upon earring-cartridge 14 (or upon the earring-cartridge stud gun), pierced-ear<br>
earring cartridge halves 113 and 115 open up away from pierced-ear earring E<br>
pierced-ear earring nut N is disengaged from nut jaw 114, the ear has been<br>
pierced, and the earring-cartridge stud gun with earring cartridge 14 may then be<br>
removed from the area adjacent the pierced ear. Because of termini portions 125<br>
and 127 being retained, as seen in FIG. 6C, stud-holder halves 113 and 115 do<br>
not fall away, and preclude reloading of the cartridge to negate sterility. That is,<br>
the right-angle protuberances at the ends of termini portions 125 and 127<br>
captively retain cartridge halves 113 and 115 to prevent reloading of a stud and<br>
reuse of the earring cartridge.<br>
The earring-cartridge stud gun 12 is shown in FIGS. 7-8 and fully<br>
described in U.S. Patent No. 5,868,774 but is also described here for the sake of<br>
completeness. Figures 7 and 8 show that two inter-fitting portions comprise<br>
earring-cartridge stud gun 12: grip 20 and plunger 22. Plunger 22 fits within grip<br>
20 and slidably travels there-through, a generally short distance, namely, that<br>
distance necessary to pierce the ear with the stud portion of the pierced-ear<br>
earring. That distance of travel is approximately one-half inch and plunger 22 is<br>
easily controlled by the hand of the operator. The length of the plunger-grip<br>
assembly is approximately two-and-one-half inches taken along line 5-5 shown<br>
in FIG. 8.<br>
As shown in FIG. 7, plunger 22 is biased by biasing means, such as<br>
spring 24, away from grip 20. Oppositely disposed stud-gun spring posts 26a, b<br>
serve to hold spring 24 in place between grip 20 and plunger 22 in a normally-<br>
opposed position. Plunger 22 is held in captive association with grip 20 as set<br>
forth in more detail below.<br>
Plunger 22 may be hollow in order to conserve cost, weight and to allow<br>
for greater ease of manufacturing. On the inside of plunger 22 within grip 20,<br>
lower abutment stop 28 and an upper abutment stop 30 serve to limit the forward<br>
travel of plunger 22 into the interior of grip 20. The distance between the contact<br>
surfaces of abutment stops 28, 30, and grip 20 is approximately one-half inch.<br>
Abutment stops 28, 30 maybe formed of the same material as plunger 22 and<br>
may be molded as an integral unit with plunger 22.<br>
Upper abutment stop 30 is formed in. an L-shape (in cross section) so as<br>
to accommodate traveling portion 40 of cradle 74 provided by earring-cartridge<br>
stud gun 12 for earring cartridge 14. Traveling portion 40 has a depending<br>
projection 42 that fits within notch 44 provided between upper abutment stop 30<br>
and plunger 22. Tongue 46 projects laterally forward and away from plunger 22<br>
to act as an additional travel limiting stop as will be seen. A cradle backstop 48<br>
serves to provide the retaining support and abutment at the back of earring<br>
cartridge 14 once it is fitted into earring-cartridge stud gun 12 and more<br>
specifically, cradle 74 thereof.<br>
Traveling portion 40 is molded as one piece with plunger 22 or may be<br>
welded thereto so as to be integral with plunger 22. Traveling portion 40 travels<br>
with plunger 22 due to its connection with upper abutment stop 30 via depending<br>
portion 42. Along with plunger 22, traveling portion 40 slidably travels along any<br>
surface of grip 20 with which it may come into contact except where abutment<br>
occurs.<br>
Grip portion 20 has a front-curved surface 60 adapted to fit against the<br>
fingers of the hand. In conjunction with rear-curved surface 62 of plunger 22, the<br>
portion of earring cartridge stud gun 12 engaged by a person's hand fits<br>
comfortably within the hand due to complementary curved surfaces 60, 62. Grip<br>
portion 20 is approximately two inches in height, about three inches in overall<br>
width, and defines upper slot 64 through which cradle backstop 48 travels. An<br>
abutment or end wall 66 of slot 64 of grip portion 20 serves to prevent the<br>
rearward travel of cradle backstop 48 beyond that shown. Abutment 66 between<br>
cradle backstop 48 holds plunger 22 in sliding association with grip 20, even<br>
though biasing means 24 normally urges them apart.<br>
Projecting forwardly from the top of grip 20 is a cradle extension 70 that<br>
terminates in a cradle forestop 72. The area defined between cradle forestop 72<br>
and cradle backstop 48 serves to define a cradle 74 within which earring<br>
cartridge 14 may fit and be telescopically compressed during the ear-piercing<br>
process. Provided beneath upper surface 76 and above lower surface 78 of<br>
cradle extension 70 is a tongue groove 80. Tongue groove 80 provides travel<br>
room for tongue 46 as it travels forward. As tongue 46 is captively retained<br>
between upper surface 76 and lower surface 78 of cradle extension 70, greater<br>
stability and alignment is provided during the ear-piercing process as cradle 74<br>
maintains its relative geometry and shape during the piercing process.<br>
In order to provide additional support to cradle extension 70, integrally<br>
molded cradle extension support 90 extends forward of tongue groove 80 and<br>
terminates below forestop 72. Cradle extension support 90 provides additional<br>
support to cradle extension 70.<br>
The interior of cradle 74 has additional means by which earring cartridge<br>
14 is held and maintained in position. Thus, oppositely disposed across cradle<br>
74 adjacent forestop 72 are two side supports 1O0a, b. Cradle side supports<br>
1O0a, b project upwardly approximately an eighth of an inch and provide<br>
additional side securement and positioning for earring cartridge 14. The interior<br>
of backstop 48 and forestop 72 may have notches or ridges by which to engage<br>
ribs 180, 181 present on earring cartridge 14. In one embodiment, a small<br>
extension or finger (not shown) may extend upwardly from upper surface 76 of<br>
cradle extension 70 adjacent forestop 72 to frictionally engage the front end of<br>
earring cartridge 14. Both backstop 48 and forestop 72 may have side flange<br>
projections 82 to better engage and secure earring cartridge 14 in cradle 74.<br>
The earring-cartridge and the earring-cartridge stud gun may be made of<br>
lightweight but durable plastics that are easily formed into the appropriate<br>
shapes for use as set forth above. In preferred embodiments, the stud gun<br>
and/or the cartridge may be made from one or more plastic materials including,<br>
but not limited to, the following materials: polyester, polycarbonate, paper,<br>
foil, polyimide, polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene, and acrylomitrite-<br>
butadiene-styrene (ABS) polymers. Alternatively, the stud gun and/or the<br>
cartridge may be made from nonplastic materials such as metal or paper.<br>
Referring to Figure 9, earring cartridge 14 with earring stud P and nut N<br>
fits within stackable box 16. Earring-cartridge box 16 is a sealable container<br>
within which earring cartridge 14 and pierced-ear earring (N and P) may be<br>
transported and stored until ready for use. Box 16 allows and maintains<br>
sterilization of earring cartridge 14, and pierced-ear earring (N and P).<br>
As shown in Figure 9, earring cartridge box 16 is constructed to conform<br>
to the top of earring cartridge 14. Conforming top 300 of box 16 conforms to the<br>
top exterior of earring cartridge 14 for a close but not constricting fit. Internal<br>
indentations 301, 302 provide gripping means by which top 300 grips earring<br>
cartridge 14 inside. As earring cartridge 14 may take a variety of shapes,<br>
including shapes that accommodate hinged hoops, the shape achieved by<br>
conforming top 300 of box 16 may also take the same variety of shapes in order<br>
to accommodate earring cartridge 14.<br>
The plan and elevation views of conforming top 300 are shown in Figures<br>
10A and 10B, respectively. The packing box design allows the cradle of the<br>
earring-cartridge stud gun to fit within box 16 past flange 304. This allows the<br>
earring-cartridge stud gun to engage earring cartridge 14 and remove it from box<br>
16. This provides means by which the sterile nature of earring cartridge 14 and<br>
pierced-ear earring (N and P) may be maintained once the seal on earring-<br>
cartridge box 16 has been broken. Additionally, earring cartridge 14 may be<br>
reinserted back into box 16 after the ear-piercing process has been performed<br>
by fitting earring-cartridge box 16 over earring cartridge 14 and removing earring<br>
cartridge 14 from the cradle of the earring-cartridge stud gun.<br>
During manufacture and prior distribution, earring cartridge 14 is fitted with<br>
a pierced ear earring (N and P) within a stud post holder assembly 116. The<br>
earring cartridge is then fitted within conforming top 300 of earring cartridge box<br>
16. The bottom of earring cartridge 14 is above flange 304 and within the<br>
confines of box 16. Sterilizing gas or the like may be introduced into the confines<br>
of the earring-cartridge box 16 so as to sterilize its entire contents and any<br>
exposed surfaces, including earring cartridge 14 and pierced-ear earring E.<br>
Medical-grade Tyvak paper backing or the like (not shown) may be adhesively or<br>
otherwise sealingly attached to flange 304. If desired, sterilizing gas may be<br>
trapped within earring-cartridge box 16 to preserve and maintain the sterile<br>
environment previously established. Obviously, other sterilizing procedures may<br>
be used.<br>
The bottom of box 16 is sealed with a lid 310, which is shown in plan and<br>
elevation views in Figures 11A and 11B respectively. Lid 310 snaps shut over<br>
flange 304, thereby providing protection for the paper backing used to seal<br>
conforming top 300. Lid 310 is provided with pegs 311 which can fit into<br>
corresponding holes 305 of the conforming top of another packing box. Thus,<br>
this peg and hole arrangement can be used to vertically stack the packing box on<br>
top of each other.<br>
Once the lid is snapped onto the flange of top 300, sealed, earring-<br>
cartridge box 16 may then be transported and stored until ready for use,<br>
maintaining earring cartridge 14 and its pierced-ear earring (N and P) in a sterile<br>
condition until ready to use.<br>
Generally, earring-cartridge packing box 16 is made of clear or other see-<br>
through plastics or materials so that earring cartridge 14 and its pierced-ear<br>
earring (N and P) may be easily visible prior to the ear-piercing process.<br>
However, it may also be made of opaque or translucent material. In preferred<br>
embodiments, the packing box may be made from one or more plastic materials<br>
including, but not limited to, the following materials: polyester, polycarbonate,<br>
paper, foil, polyimide, polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene, and<br>
acrylomitrite-butadiene-styrene (ABS) polymers. Alternatively, the box may be<br>
made from non-plastic materials such as metal or paper.<br>
In operation, earring-cartridge box 16 with sterilized earring cartridge 14 is<br>
used in conjunction with the earring-cartridge stud gun as follows. Earring-<br>
cartridge box 16 is opened by snapping apart lid 310. The paper backing is then<br>
removed from its adhesive attachment with flange 304. This exposes the bottom<br>
of earring cartridge 14 and provides access to the cradle to the interior of<br>
earring-cartridge box 16. The cradle of the stud gun is then brought into the<br>
confines of earring-cartridge box 16 to engage the bottom of earring cartridge 14.<br>
Once the cradle has securely engaged earring cartridge 14, box 16 is then<br>
removed from the top of earring cartridge 14. The ear to be pierced may then be<br>
pierced by placing the ear between the nut jaw and post P of the earring E. The<br>
plunger and the grip of the stud gun are then pressed together to force the<br>
earring post into earring nut N, piercing the ear lobe, as described more fully<br>
above.<br>
Conforming top 300 may then be re-fitted over the used earring cartridge<br>
whereby earring cartridge 14 may be engaged within top 300 and removed from<br>
cradle 74. Following that top 300 may be sealed shut by snapping its lid 310<br>
back on. By using packing box 16, earring cartridge 14 need never be touched<br>
by human hands or other contaminating surface prior to, during, or after the ear-<br>
piercing process because the operator can load and unload the stud gun by<br>
holding the packing box, without touching the cartridge.<br>
Thus, in the instant invention a cartridge 14 is now designed not merely as<br>
a container for the pierced-ear earring and earring Nut N, but also acts as a<br>
loading tool by which the earring-cartridge stud gun may be loaded. Moreover,<br>
cartridge 14 is stored and transported in stackable packing boxes 300, which<br>
provide sealed secure storage for the cartridge before and after use and which<br>
are adapted for convenient vertical stacking. It can be readily seen that by using<br>
the system disclosed that sterility and ease of handling for user of the system is<br>
accomplished.<br>
While the present invention has been described with reference to<br>
particular embodiments, it is recognized that additional variations of the present<br>
