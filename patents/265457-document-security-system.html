DESCRIPTION<br>
DOCUMENT SECURITY SYSTEM<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention generally relates to a<br>
document security system in which a document job requested<br>
by a user is executed when the user is permitted to use a<br>
document processing device based on a using right of the<br>
device and to execute the job based on a using right of the<br>
document, and an obligation is executed corresponding to<br>
the type of the document obtained from image data of the<br>
document.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Recently, the importance of maintaining the<br>
security of a document has been largely recognized and the<br>
necessity to keep corporate secrets has been enhanced. In<br>
addition to in an electronic document processed on a<br>
personal computer, in a document printed from the<br>
electronic document and a document transmitted or received<br>
by a facsimile, necessity of maintaining the security of<br>
the document has been increased.<br>
Especially, in an image processing apparatus<br>
having plural functions which process a paper document and<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
an electronic document, necessity of maintaining the<br>
security of the document has been increased.<br>
In Patent Documents 1 and 2, and Non-Patent<br>
document 1, when a secret document is printed, a pattern<br>
for identifying the secret document is automatically<br>
printed on a background of the secret document according to<br>
a security policy, and when the printed secret document is<br>
copied or scanned by an image processing apparatus, the<br>
image processing apparatus identifies the pattern on the<br>
background and determines whether the document is copied or<br>
scanned according to the security policy.<br>
In Patent Document 3, when a document is copied,<br>
scanned, or transmitted by a facsimile function in an image<br>
processing apparatus, the image processing apparatus<br>
instantly determines whether the scanned document has a<br>
specific background by image matching, and controls<br>
processes of copying, scanning, or transmitting by the<br>
facsimile function based on the determined result.<br>
In Patent Document 4, a pattern preventing<br>
copying is attached to image data of a read document; in<br>
addition, a barcode is attached to a document to be<br>
processed or later processed, and the document is prevented<br>
from being processed.<br>
In Non-Patent Document 2, an administrator<br>
determines a person who can use functions of copying,<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
printing, and scanning.<br>
In Non-Patent Document 3, in a case where an<br>
image is copied, when a specific mask pattern is detected<br>
during the copying, the image is broken.<br>

Preventing Function, <url:></url:>
http//www.ricoh.co.jp/imagio/neo/753/Point/point4.html&gt;<br>
In Non-Patent Document 2, in a system maintaining<br>
security of a document when the document is processed by an<br>
image processing apparatus, functions such as a copying<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
function, a facsimile function, and a scanning function are<br>
limited to authorized persons.<br>
However, in the above system, a user having<br>
authority for copying a document can freely copy a secret<br>
document. That is, maintaining the security of the secret<br>
document is not sufficient.<br>
In addition, in Patent Documents 3 and 4, when a<br>
secret document is printed, a specific background pattern<br>
is printed together with the secret document. In a case<br>
where the printed secret document having the specific<br>
background pattern is tried to be copied, when the image of<br>
the secret document is read, the specific background<br>
pattern is detected in real time. Or the image to be<br>
output is changed by the detected result. For example, in<br>
Patent Document 3, the image is output with gray all over.<br>
However, in the above methods, the number of the<br>
secret documents to be processed is limited to the number<br>
of the specific background patterns. For example, when a<br>
specific background pattern is provided for a confidential<br>
document, the method is used so that only administrators<br>
can copy the confidential document; however, when users are<br>
classified into several levels and the number of the secret<br>
documents is increased, the number of the specific<br>
background patterns is not sufficient.<br>
In Non-Patent Document 1 and Patent Document 1,<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
when a paper document is copied by an image processing<br>
apparatus, a traceable ID embedded in the background of the<br>
paper document is detected and copying the paper document<br>
is determined by querying a server of the traceable ID.<br>
However, since the query is sent to the server<br>
located far away, in a high-speed image processing<br>
apparatus capable of copying 100 pages or more per minute,<br>
it is very difficult to identify the traceable IDs and<br>
determine whether the paper documents are copied in real<br>
time in the high-speed operations.<br>
In addition, in Patent Document 2, when an<br>
electronic document encrypted as a secret document is<br>
printed, a specific printing method is forcibly used<br>
corresponding to the security policy. For example, a<br>
specific pattern is added to the background of the<br>
electronic document.<br>
However, when other documents which are not<br>
encrypted as secret documents are printed, the documents<br>
are printed without the specific patterns. For example, a<br>
draft including secret information is not printed with the<br>
specific pattern. Therefore, although the draft includes<br>
the secret information, the draft can be copied as a<br>
general document.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Next, referring to the drawings, an embodiment of<br>
the present invention is described in detail.<br>
Fig. 1 is a network structure of a document<br>
security system 100 according to the embodiment of the<br>
present invention. As shown in Fig. 1, the document<br>
security system 100 includes a user terminal 1, a printer 2,<br>
a digital multifunctional apparatus 3, an administrator<br>
terminal 4; and a server group including a user<br>
authentication server 10, a policy server A 20, a policy<br>
server B 30, and a content analyzing server 40 that are<br>
operated as back-end services. In addition, the document<br>
security system 100 includes a network 7, and the above<br>
elements are connected to each other via the network 7.<br>
The user terminal 1 is used by a general user for handling<br>
an electronic document la. The printer 2 is used to print<br>
out a paper document 2c. The digital multifunctional<br>
apparatus 3 is an image processing apparatus having<br>
multiple functions such as copying a paper manuscript 3a,<br><br>
- 13 -<br>
scanning the paper manuscript 3a, and transmitting the<br>
paper manuscript 3a by a facsimile function. The<br>
administrator terminal 4 is used by an administrator of the<br>
document security system 100 and is a destination of alert<br>
mail 4e.<br>
The user authentication server 10 manages user<br>
authentication information and authenticates a user. The<br>
policy server A 20 manages a document security policy 21<br>
which manages document using rights of users. The policy<br>
server B 30 manages a device security policy 31 which<br>
manages device using rights of users. The content<br>
analyzing server 40 manages an original digital document.<br>
Each of the user terminal 1, the printer 2, the<br>
digital multifunctional apparatus 3, the administrator<br>
terminal 4, the user authentication server 10, the policy<br>
server A 20, the policy server B 30, and the content<br>
analyzing server 40 provides at least a CPU (central<br>
processing unit), a memory unit, storage which stores<br>
programs (described below), a communication unit for<br>
communicating via the network 7, an input unit, and a<br>
display unit.<br>
In Fig. 1, in order to describe the functions in<br>
the document security system 100, the several elements are<br>
shown; however, one element can include several functions.<br>
For example, one terminal can include the user terminal 1<br><br>
- 14 -<br>
and the administrator terminal 4, and one apparatus can<br>
include the printer 2 and the digital multifunctional<br>
apparatus 3. Further, one server can include the user<br>
authentication server 10, the policy server A 20, and the<br>
policy server B 30.<br>
When the document security system 100 is<br>
established as an expanded system of a DRM (digital rights<br>
management) system, the performance of the document<br>
security system 100 can be high. Therefore, in the<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the document security<br>
system 100 is established based on the DRM system.<br>
First, referring to Figs. 2 through 4, basic<br>
process flows of the document security system 100 are<br>
described. Fig. 2 is a process flow for maintaining<br>
security of an original document. First, when the user<br>
terminal 1 sends an original document lb as a confidential<br>
document to be encrypted to the policy server A 20 (SI),<br>
the policy server A 20 forms a secured document lc in which<br>
the original document lb is encrypted. Further, the policy<br>
server A 20 registers the contents of the original document<br>
lb in the content analyzing server 40 (S2). Then the<br>
policy server A 20 sends the secured document lc to the<br>
user terminal 1 (S3).<br>
In the registration of the contents of the<br>
original document lb in the content analyzing server 40,<br><br>
- 15 -<br>
the policy server A 20 registers the original document 1b<br>
and security attributes such as the document ID and the<br>
security level, and the content analyzing server 40<br>
extracts text from the original document lb.<br>
Fig. 3 is a process flow for printing a secured<br>
document. In Fig. 3, when the user terminal 1 desires to<br>
print the secured document lc, the user of the user<br>
terminal 1 requests the user authentication server 10 to<br>
authenticate the user (Sll). Further, the user of the user<br>
terminal 1 is confirmed to have a right for printing the<br>
secured document lc by the policy server A 20 (S12) . When<br>
the user of the user terminal 1 is confirmed to have the<br>
right, the policy server A 20 sends a decryption key to the<br>
user terminal 1.<br>
The user terminal 1 receives the decryption key<br>
and requests the printer 2 to print the secured document lc<br>
by applying a security policy designated by the document<br>
security policy 21 (S13). The printer 2 prints the secured<br>
document lc as the paper document 2c (S14).<br>
When a security maintaining print such as "Copy<br>
Protection against Unauthorized Copy" is defined in the<br>
document security policy 21 beforehand, the paper document<br>
2c is printed with a specific pattern on the background.<br>
Fig. 4 is a process flow for copying a paper<br>
document, scanning the paper document, or transmitting the<br><br>
- 16 -<br>
paper document by the facsimile function in the digital<br>
multifunctional apparatus 3. In Fig. 4, when a user<br>
desires to scan a paper manuscript 3a (or copy the paper<br>
manuscript 3a, or transmit the paper manuscript 3a by the<br>
facsimile function) on the digital multifunctional<br>
apparatus 3 (S21), the user of the digital multifunctional<br>
apparatus 3 is authenticated by the user authentication<br>
server 10 (S22). The digital multifunctional apparatus 3<br>
confirms the policy server B 30 that the user has a right<br>
to scan the paper manuscript 3a (S23). When the user has<br>
the right, the digital multifunctional apparatus 3 scans<br>
the paper manuscript 3a and detects a specific pattern when<br>
the specific pattern is merged with image data of the paper<br>
manuscript 3a.<br>
The digital multifunctional apparatus 3 confirms<br>
with the policy server A 20 that the user can scan the<br>
paper manuscript 3a on which the specific pattern is merged<br>
(S24); when the user can scan the paper manuscript 3a based<br>
on the confirmed result, the digital multifunctional<br>
apparatus 3 scans the paper manuscript 3a (S25) and outputs<br>
scanned data of the paper manuscript 3a to a destination<br>
designated by the user.<br>
The policy server A 20 requests the content<br>
analyzing server 40 to analyze the contents of the image<br>
data of the scanned paper manuscript 3a (S26). When the<br><br>
- 17 -<br>
paper manuscript 3a is prevented from being scanned based<br>
on the analyzed result, the policy server A 20 sends alert<br>
mail to the administrator terminal 4 (S27).<br>
As described above, in the embodiment of the<br>
present invention, when the paper manuscript 3a is<br>
processed, the security policy is confirmed in real time,<br>
and after that, the security policy is again confirmed by<br>
analyzing the contents of the paper manuscript 3a.<br>
Next, referring to Figs. 5 and 6, a structure and<br>
a process flow for maintaining the security of the original<br>
document lb are described. Fig. 5 is a diagram showing the<br>
structure and the process flow for maintaining the security<br>
of the original document lb. Fig. 6 is a diagram showing a<br>
process for forming a secured document by a document<br>
security program.<br>
As shown in Fig. 5, the policy server A 20<br>
provides a document security program 20P, the document<br>
security policy 21, a policy server A program 22, and a<br>
document security attribute database 24. The content<br>
analyzing server 40 provides a content analyzing program 42<br>
and a content register database 44.<br>
A user 9 sends an original document lb and<br>
security attributes thereof to the document security<br>
program 20P (S51). The security attributes include a<br>
domain to which the original document lb belongs, a<br><br>
- 18 -<br>
category of the original document lb, the security levels,<br>
information of persons relating to the original document lb,<br>
and so on.<br>
As shown in Fig. 6, the document security program<br>
20P generates an encryption key and a decryption key, and<br>
forms an encrypted document 22c by encrypting the original<br>
document lb while using the encryption key. Further, the<br>
document security program 20P generates a unique document<br>
ID for identifying a document and forms a secured document<br>
lc by adding the unique document ID to the encrypted<br>
document 22c.<br>
The document security program 20P registers the<br>
document ID, the decryption key, and the security<br>
attributes in the policy server A program 22 (S52) .<br>
Further, the document security program 20P sends the<br>
document ID, the security attributes, and the original<br>
document lb to the content analyzing program 42 in the<br>
content analyzing server 40 , and registers the contents<br>
(the document ID, the security attributes) of the original<br>
document lb in the content register database 44 (S53).<br>
Then the document security program 20P sends the secured<br>
document lc to the user 9 (S54).<br>
As described above, when the original document lb<br>
is encrypted and the security thereof is maintained, the<br>
contents including the document ID, and the security<br><br>
- 19 -<br>
attributes of the original document lb are registered in<br>
the content register database 44. That is, in the content<br>
register database 44, information is registered in which<br>
information the document category, the security level, and<br>
so on of the original document lb are described.<br>
By the above process flows, the secured document<br>
1c is formed. Then the user 9 can send the secured<br>
document lc to another user 9.<br>
Next, a process flow is described in which the<br>
user 9 accesses the secured document lc after receiving it.<br>
Fig. 7 is a process flow for accessing the secured document<br>
1c.<br>
In Fig. 7, first, the user 9 inputs user<br>
authentication information (for example, the user name, the<br>
user password, and so on) and the secured document lc in<br>
the user terminal 1, and instructs to display or print the<br>
secured document lc (S71).<br>
A document displaying/printing program lp in the<br>
user terminal 1 sends the user authentication information<br>
to the user authentication server 10 (S72). A user<br>
authentication program 12 in the user authentication server<br>
10 authenticates the user 9 based on the user<br>
authentication information by referring to information in a<br>
user management database 14, and sends the user<br>
authenticated result to the user terminal 1 (S73) .<br><br>
- 20 -<br>
The document displaying/printing program 1p in<br>
the user terminal 1 obtains the document ID in the secured<br>
document 1c, and sends the obtained document ID, the user<br>
authenticated result received from the user authentication<br>
server 10, and the type of the access (displaying or<br>
printing) to the policy server A 20 (S74).<br>
The policy server A program 22 in the policy<br>
server A 20 determines whether the user 9 accesses the<br>
secured document lc and obligation of the user 9 by<br>
referring to the document security policy 21 and<br>
information in the document security attribute database 24<br>
based on the document ID, the user authenticated result,<br>
and the type of the access. Then the policy server A<br>
program 22 sends the determined result of the access and<br>
the obligation to the user terminal 1, and further sends<br>
the decryption key when the user access is permitted (S75).<br>
The document displaying/printing program lp<br>
receives the determined result of the access and the<br>
obligation, and further receives the decryption key from<br>
the policy server A program 22 when the user access is<br>
permitted.<br>
When the user access is not permitted, the<br>
document displaying/printing program lp informs the user of<br>
the non-permission of the access, and the process flow ends.<br>
When the user access is permitted, the document<br><br>
- 21 -<br>
displaying/printing program 1p obtains the original<br>
document lb by decrypting the encrypted document in the<br>
secured document 1c while using the received decryption key,<br>
and applies rendering to the original document lb and<br>
displays the original document lb (S76), or prints the<br>
original document lb (S77) . When the document<br>
displaying/printing program lp receives an obligation<br>
(described below) from the policy server A program 22, a<br>
process for the obligation is executed. When the type of<br>
the access is to display, the original document lb (the<br>
decrypted secured document lc) is displayed on the user<br>
terminal 1, and when the type of the access is to print,<br>
the original document lb is printed by the printer 2 by<br>
instructing the printer 2 to print the original document lb.<br>
The process flow by the document<br>
displaying/printing program lp can use a process flow<br>
described in Patent Document 2. Therefore, when the<br>
process flow described in Patent Document 2 is used, a<br>
secret document is printed by the document security policy<br>
21 and the policy server A program 22 while setting an<br>
obligation (requirement in Patent Document 2) such as<br>
"print by merging a traceable pattern on the background".<br>
In this case, when the user 9 requests to print<br>
the secured document lc on the user terminal 1, the policy<br>
server A program 20 sends an obligation that the secured<br><br>
- 22 -<br>
document 1c be printed by merging a traceable pattern as<br>
the determined result, and the document displaying/printing<br>
program 1p prints the secured document lc by merging the<br>
traceable pattern on the printer 2.<br>
Therefore, when the secured document lc is copied,<br>
scanned, or transmitted by the facsimile function in the<br>
digital multifunctional apparatus 3, the secured document<br>
lc can be recognized as a secret document.<br>
In all cases of copying, scanning, and<br>
transmitting by a facsimile function the paper manuscript<br>
3a in the digital multifunctional apparatus 3, the paper<br>
manuscript 3a is scanned, then the scanned image data are<br>
copied, stored, or transmitted by the facsimile function.<br>
The difference among the above processes occurs after<br>
scanning the paper manuscript 3a. Therefore, in the<br>
following, only the case of scanning the paper manuscript<br>
3a is described. When copying or transmitting the paper<br>
manuscript 3a is executed, a process similar to the process<br>
in scanning the paper manuscript 3a is executed.<br>
Fig. 8 is a process flow for scanning the paper<br>
manuscript 3a. As shown in Fig. 8, the policy server B 30<br>
includes the device security policy 31, a policy server B<br>
program 32, and a device security attribute database 34.<br>
In Fig. 8, when a user 9 desires to scan a paper<br>
manuscript 3a in the digital multifunctional apparatus 3,<br><br>
- 23 -<br>
the user 9 inputs the user authentication information (the<br>
user name and the user password) on an operating panel of<br>
the digital multifunctional apparatus 3 (S81) . A scanning<br>
program 3P in the digital multifunctional apparatus 3 sends<br>
the user authentication information received from the user<br>
9 to the user authentication server 10 (S82).<br>
The user authentication program 12 in the user<br>
authentication server 10 authenticates the user 9 based on<br>
the user authentication information by referring to<br>
information in the user management database 14, and sends<br>
the user authenticated result to the digital<br>
multifunctional apparatus 3 (S83).<br>
When the user 9 is authenticated by the user<br>
authentication server 10, the scanning program 3P in the<br>
digital multifunctional apparatus 3 displays the user<br>
authenticated result on the operating panel (S84) and the<br>
user 9 pushes a scanning button in the digital<br>
multifunctional apparatus 3.<br>
The scanning program 3P in the digital<br>
multifunctional apparatus 3 sends the user authenticated<br>
result, the ID (device ID) of the digital multifunctional<br>
apparatus 3, and the type of the access (in this case,<br>
scanning) to the policy server B 30, and the policy server<br>
B program 32 determines whether the user 9 has a right to<br>
scan the paper manuscript 3a in the digital multifunctional<br><br>
- 24 -<br>
apparatus 3 by referring to the device security policy 31<br>
and information in the device security attribute database<br>
34 (S85).<br>
The digital multifunctional apparatus 3 receives<br>
a policy determined result B including a permission/non-<br>
permission result and an obligation from the policy server<br>
B 30 (S86). When the policy determined result B shows<br>
permission, the digital multifunctional apparatus 3 scans<br>
the paper manuscript 3a. Then the scanning program 3P<br>
determines whether a specific background pattern is in the<br>
scanned image by analyzing image data of the scanned paper<br>
manuscript 3a.<br>
The scanning program 3P sends the user<br>
authenticated result, information detected in real time<br>
including the type of the background pattern, the scanned<br>
data, the type of the access (scanning), and the policy<br>
determined result B to the policy server A 20. The policy<br>
server A program 22 determines whether that the user 9 has<br>
a right to scan the paper manuscript 3a (S87).<br>
The digital multifunctional apparatus 3 receives<br>
a policy determined result A including the permission/non-<br>
permission for scanning and an obligation from the policy<br>
server A program 22 (S88), and executes the scanning<br>
process. For example, the digital multifunctional<br>
apparatus 3 sends the scanned data to a designated<br><br>
- 25 -<br>
destination.<br>
When the policy is determined, the policy server<br>
A program 22 merges the obligation which is included in the<br>
policy determined result B corresponding to the device<br>
security policy 31 with the obligation which is included in<br>
the policy determined result A corresponding to the<br>
document security policy 21 by a merging rule set<br>
beforehand in the policy server A program 22.<br>
When the obligations cannot be merged, the policy<br>
determined result A is non-permission (described below in<br>
Fig. 9). When the policy determined result A is non-<br>
permission or the obligations of the policy determined<br>
results A and B cannot be executed, the scanning program 3P<br>
stops the scanning process as an error operation.<br>
The scanning program 3P displays the above<br>
processed result on the user terminal 1 and ends the<br>
processes (S89).<br>
The policy server A program 22 sends the<br>
scanned data received from the scanning program 3P to the<br>
content analyzing server 40 (S90). The content analyzing<br>
program 42 in the content analyzing server 40 estimates a<br>
security attribute by analyzing the background and the<br>
contents of the scanned data of the paper manuscript 3a.<br>
The policy server A program 22 receives the estimated<br>
security attribute (S91) and executes a process<br><br>
- 26 -<br>
corresponding to the document security policy 21 based on<br>
the attribute. For example, the policy server A program 22<br>
sends alert mail to the administrator terminal 4.<br>
As described above, the scanning program 3P<br>
permits the user 9 to scan the paper manuscript 3a when the<br>
user 9 has both the right to use the digital<br>
multifunctional apparatus 3 and the right to use the paper<br>
manuscript 3a.<br>
In addition, since the right determination is<br>
processed based on information obtained in real time, the<br>
scanning program 3P does not force the user 9 to wait<br>
unnecessarily. Further, since the contents of the scanned<br>
data are analyzed, even if a user 9 not having the right<br>
scans a secret document, the administrator can know about<br>
the unauthorized use of the secret document. Therefore,<br>
the document security system 100 can be realized in which<br>
the security of the secret document is maintained and<br>
usability is increased.<br>
Fig. 9 is a table TBL 50 showing a rule of the<br>
permission and the non-permission for scanning the paper<br>
manuscript 3a by the user 9 in combinations of the document<br>
security policy 21 and the device security policy 31.<br>
As shown in Fig. 9, only when the document<br>
security policy 21 and the device security policy 31 permit<br>
scanning the paper manuscript 3a by the user 9, the user 9<br><br>
- 27 -<br>
can scan the paper manuscript 3a. However, an obligation<br>
is forced on the permission in which the obligation of the<br>
document security policy 21 and the obligation of the<br>
device security policy 31 are merged by a predetermined<br>
rule. When the obligation cannot be forced, the scanning<br>
is not permitted.<br>
Fig. 10 is a table showing an example of<br>
obligation merging rules. In Fig. 10, in an obligation<br>
merging rule "Simple-merge", an obligation designated by<br>
the document security policy 21 is simply merged with an<br>
obligation designated by the device security policy 31.<br>
When obligations which compete against each other exist,<br>
the merged result becomes a merging error.<br>
In an obligation merging rule "Document-only",<br>
only an obligation designated by the document security<br>
policy 21 is used. Therefore, a merging error does not<br>
occur. When the following is determined, this rule can be<br>
used. That is, the document security policy 21 is used for<br>
a document whose policy is determined, and device security<br>
policy 31 is used for others.<br>
In an obligation merging rule "Device-only", only<br>
an obligation designated by the device security policy 31<br>
is used. Therefore, a merging error does not occur.<br>
In an obligation merging rule "Document-<br>
preference-merge", an obligation designated by the document<br><br>
- 28 -<br>
security policy 21 is merged with an obligation designated<br>
by the device security policy 31. When obligations which<br>
compete against each other exist, the obligation designated<br>
by the document security policy 21 is used. Therefore, a<br>
merging error does not occur.<br>
In an obligation merging rule "Device-preference-<br>
merge", an obligation designated by the document security<br>
policy 21 is merged with an obligation designated by the<br>
device security policy 31. When obligations which compete<br>
against each other exist, an obligation designated by the<br>
device security policy 31 is used. Therefore, a merging<br>
error does not occur.<br>
The administrator of the policy server A program<br>
22 sets the obligation merging rule in the program 22 by<br>
selecting one of the obligation merging rules.<br>
Fig. 11 is a sequence chart showing processes to<br>
scan the paper manuscript 3a. In Fig. 11, a request to a<br>
program is executed by a function call (continuous line),<br>
and a result processed by the function call is returned as<br>
a return value (dashed line).<br>
Referring to Fig. 11, the processes are described.<br>
First, the user 9 requests to be authenticated by inputting<br>
user authentication information on the operating panel of<br>
the digital multifunctional apparatus 3 (S101). The<br>
scanning program 3P of the digital multifunctional<br><br>
- 29 -<br>
apparatus 3 sends the request including the user<br>
authentication information to the user authentication<br>
server 10 (S102).<br>
The user authentication program 12 in the user<br>
authentication server 10 authenticates the user 9 based on<br>
the user authentication information received from the<br>
digital multifunctional apparatus 3 (S103), and returns the<br>
user authenticated result to the scanning program 3P (S104).<br>
When the user authenticated result shows<br>
successful, the scanning program 3P displays the main<br>
screen on the digital multifunctional apparatus 3 (S105).<br>
When the user authenticated result does not show successful,<br>
the scanning program 3P informs the user 9 of non-<br>
authentication and does not executes the processes by the<br>
user 9.<br>
The user 9 sends a paper manuscript scanning<br>
request to the digital multifunctional apparatus 3 by<br>
putting the paper manuscript 3a thereon (S106). In order<br>
to determine whether the user 9 has a right to use the<br>
digital multifunctional apparatus 3, the scanning program<br>
3P of the digital multifunctional apparatus 3 sends a<br>
device using right determination request to the policy<br>
server B 30 to determine whether the user 9 has the device<br>
using right based on the paper manuscript scanning request<br>
(S107). In the device using right determination request,<br><br>
- 30 -<br>
the user authenticated result, the device information, and<br>
the type of access (in this case, scanning) are designated.<br>
The policy server B program 32 in the policy<br>
server B 30 determines whether the user 9 has the device<br>
using right by referring to the device security policy 31<br>
and information in the device security attribute database<br>
34 (S108), and returns the determined result to the<br>
scanning program 3P as the device using right determined<br>
result (corresponding to the policy determined result B<br>
shown in Fig. 8) (S109).<br>
When the user 9 does not have the device using<br>
right, the scanning program 3P informs the user 9 of that<br>
the user 9 does not have the device using right for<br>
scanning the paper manuscript 3a and ends the processes.<br>
When the user 9 has the device using right, the scanning<br>
program 3P scans the paper manuscript 3a (S110). Then the<br>
scanning program 3P detects a background pattern of the<br>
paper manuscript 3a from data scanned the paper manuscript<br>
3a (S111).<br>
In order to determine whether the user 9 has a<br>
document using right, the scanning program 3P sends a<br>
document using right determination request to the policy<br>
server A 20 (S112). The document using right determination<br>
request includes the user authenticated result, real time<br>
detected information by the background pattern detection in<br><br>
- 31 -<br>
S111, the scanned data, the type of the access (in this<br>
case, scanning), the device using right determined result<br>
(corresponding to the policy determined result B shown in<br>
Fig. 8).<br>
The policy server A program 22 in the policy<br>
server A 20 determines whether the user 9 has the document<br>
using right by referring to the document security policy 21<br>
and information in the document security attribute database<br>
24 (S113).<br>
The policy server A program 22 in the policy<br>
server A 20 merges obligations designated by the document<br>
using right determined result and the device using right<br>
determined result by referring to the table TBL 50 shown in<br>
Fig. 9 and the obligation merging rule shown in Fig. 10<br>
(S114).<br>
The policy server A program 22 in the policy<br>
server A 20 sends the document using right determined<br>
result to the digital multifunctional apparatus 3 (S115).<br>
Then the policy server A program 22 in the policy<br>
server A 20 sends the scanned data to the content analyzing<br>
server 40 (S116). The content analyzing program 42 in the<br>
content analyzing server 40 analyzes the contents of the<br>
scanned data (S117), and returns the analyzed result to the<br>
policy server A program 22 as a security attribute (S118).<br>
Then the policy server A program 22 in the policy<br><br>
- 32 -<br>
server A 20 determines whether an obligation exists based<br>
on the security attribute (S119), and executes the<br>
obligation based on the obligation determined result (S120).<br>
For example, alert mail is sent to the administrator<br>
terminal 4.<br>
When the scanning program 3P receives the<br>
document using right determined result as a return value in<br>
S115 after sending the document using right determination<br>
request in S112, the scanning program 3P executes an<br>
obligation designated by the document using right<br>
determined result (S115-2) and executes a scanning<br>
completion process (S115-4).<br>
The scanning program 3P sends a scanning<br>
completion notice to the user 9 as a return value for the<br>
request (S106) of scanning the paper manuscript 3a (S115-6).<br>
Then the digital multifunctional apparatus 3 displays the<br>
scanning completion on the operating panel and the user 9<br>
recognizes the scanning completion.<br>
Next, referring to Fig. 12, a structure of the<br>
device security policy 31 is described. Fig. 12 is a<br>
diagram showing an example of the structure of the device<br>
security policy 31. In Fig. 12, the device security policy<br>
31 is written, for example, in XML (extensible markup<br>
language) and is defined as a description between<br><policyset> and </policyset>.<br><br>
- 33 -<br>
In the device security policy 31 shown in Fig. 12,<br>
plural policies for a device to be used are defined in<br>
descriptions 31a, 31b, ••• between <policy> and </policy>.<br>
Targets for a policy to be defined in the<br>
description 31a are defined as a description 31-1 from<br><target> to </target> through a description 31-5 from<br><target> to </target>. In the description 31-1, the<br>
targets are defined in the following. That is, the<br>
category (<category>) of a resource (<resource>) to be the<br>
target is "OFFICE_USE" for signifying that the device is<br>
used in an office. The category (<category>) of persons<br>
(<subject>) to be the target is "RELATED_PERSONS" for<br>
signifying related persons, and the level for signifying<br>
the right level of the related persons is "ANY" for<br>
signifying that the right level is not restricted. The<br>
functions (<actions>) to be the targets are "SCAN" for<br>
signifying scanning, "COPY" for signifying copying, and<br>
"FAX" for signifying facsimile the document.<br>
For the targets defined in the description 31-1,<br>
permission is defined by the description 31-2 of <rule></rule>
Effect=Permit/&gt; signifying permission or non-permission.<br>
In addition, by the obligation (<obligation>) in<br>
the description 31-3, the type (<type>) of the obligation<br>
signifying to record a log "RECORD_AUDIT_DATA" is<br>
designated.<br><br>
- 34 -<br>
As described above, the followings are defined in<br>
the description 31-5. That is, the category (<category>)<br>
of a resource (<resource>) to be the target is "OFFICE_USE"<br>
for signifying that the device is used in an office, the<br>
category (<category>) of persons (<subject>) to be the<br>
target is "ANY" for signifying the related persons are not<br>
restricted, and the level for signifying the right level of<br>
the related persons is "ANY" for signifying that the right<br>
level is not restricted, and the function (<actions>) to be<br>
the target is "COPY" signifying for copying the document.<br>
In addition, for the targets defined by the<br>
description 31-5, the permission is defined by the<br>
description 31-6 of <rule effect="Permit/"> signifying<br>
permission or non-permission.<br>
In addition, by an obligation (<obligation>) in<br>
the description 31-7, the type (<type>) of the obligation<br>
"ALERT_MAIL" signifying alert mail is designated. Further,<br>
a parameter for writing in the alert mail is defined as,<br>
for example, "%o is applied by %u at %m.(date and time %d)".<br>
The parameter is described below in detail.<br>
Targets for a policy to be defined in the<br>
description 31b are defined as a description 31-8 from<br><target> to </target>. In the description 31-8, the<br>
targets are defined in the following. That is, the<br>
category (<category>) of a resource (<resource>) to be the<br><br>
- 35 -<br>
target is "PUBLIC_USE" for signifying that the device is<br>
used in public (no restriction). The category (<category>)<br>
of persons (<subject>) to be the target is "ANY" for<br>
signifying the persons are not restricted, and the level<br>
for signifying the right level of the persons is "ANY" for<br>
signifying that the right level is not restricted. The<br>
functions (<actions>) to be the targets are "SCAN" for<br>
signifying scanning, "COPY" for signifying copying, and<br>
"FAX" for signifying facsimile the document.<br>
For the targets defined in the description 31-8,<br>
permission is defined by the description 31-9 of <rule></rule>
Effect=Permit/&gt; signifying permission or non-permission.<br>
For the targets to be defined in the description<br>
31-8, the obligation (<obligation>) is not designated.<br>
Next, referring to Fig. 13, a structure of the<br>
device security attribute database 34 is described. Fig.<br>
13 is a diagram showing an example of the device security<br>
attribute database 34. As shown in Fig. 13, the structure<br>
of the device security attribute database 34 includes items<br>
of "DEVICE ID" (device identifying information) for<br>
identifying a device, "CATEGORY" for signifying a using<br>
range of the device, "RELATED_PERSONS" for signifying<br>
persons (sections) using the device, "ADMINISTRATORS" for<br>
signifying administrators of the device, and so on.<br>
In the "DEVICE ID", information for identifying<br><br>
- 36 -<br>
devices, for example, MFP000123, MFP000124, LP00033, and so<br>
on are registered. In the "CATEGORY", "OFFICE_USE" for<br>
signifying that the device can be used by only persons in<br>
the office, "PUBLIC_USE" for signifying that the device can<br>
be used by any persons in the office and in public, and so<br>
on are shown.<br>
For example, in the MFP000123 of "DEVICE ID",<br>
since the "CATEGORY" is "OFFICE_USE" and "RELATED_PERSONS"<br>
is "Development_Section_l", the users are restricted to the<br>
persons in the development section 1. In addition, the<br>
administrators of the MFP000123 are "tanaka" and "yamada".<br>
Next referring to Figs. 14 through 17, a<br>
structure of the document security policy 21 is described.<br>
Fig. 14 is a diagram showing a first part of the structure<br>
of the document security policy 21. Fig. 15 is a diagram<br>
showing a second part of the structure of the document<br>
security policy 21. Fig. 16 is a diagram showing a third<br>
part of the structure of the document security policy 21.<br>
Fig. 17 is a diagram showing a fourth part of the structure<br>
of the document security policy 21. The structure is a<br>
data file of the document security policy 21. In Figs. 14<br>
through 17, the document security policy 21 is written, for<br>
example, in XML and is defined as a description between<br><policyset> and </policyset>.<br>
In the document security policy 21 shown in Figs.<br><br>
- 37 -<br>
14 through 17, plural policies are defined by descriptions<br>
between <policyset> and </policyset> for documents to be<br>
used, for example, a paper document, an electronic document,<br>
and so on. In addition, the plural policies are defined by<br>
classifying into corresponding policies by using the<br>
description between <policyset> and </policyset>.<br>
In the document security policy 21 shown in Figs.<br>

to be the target is "REGULAR_STAFF" for signifying that the<br>
persons are full-time regular staffs. The function<br>
(<actions>) to be the targets is "SCAN" for signifying<br>
scanning the paper document.<br>
For the targets to be defined in the description<br>
1261, permission is defined by the description 1265 of<br><rule effect="Permit"></rule> signifying permission or non-<br>
permission.<br>
In addition, as an obligation (<obligation>) by a<br><br>
- 43 -<br>
description 1267, the type (<type>) of the obligation of<br>
"REFER_PRIMARY_POLICY" for signifying that the document<br>
policy is obliged by image analysis is designated. In this<br>
case, a parameter is not designated.<br>
In Fig. 17, targets of a policy to be defined in<br>
the description 1270 are defined as a description 1271 from<br><target> to </target>. In the description 1271, the<br>
targets are defined in the following. That is, the<br>
category (<category>) of a resource (<resource>) to be the<br>
target is "PAPER" for signifying that the document is a<br>
paper document, and the secret level of the paper document<br>
is "UNKNOWN". The right level (<level>) of persons<br>
(<subject>) to be the target is "ANY" for signifying that<br>
the right levels of the persons are not restricted. The<br>
functions (<actions>) to be the targets are "COPY" for<br>
signifying copying, "SCAN" for signifying scanning, and<br>
"FAX" for signifying facsimile the paper document.<br>
For the targets to be defined in the description<br>
1271, permission is defined by the description 1275 of<br><rule effect="Permit"></rule> signifying permission or non-<br>
permission.<br>
In addition, as an obligation (<obligation>) by a<br>
description 1277, the type (<type>) of the obligation of<br>
"REFER_PRIMARY_POLICY" for signifying that the document<br>
policy is obliged by image analysis is designated. In this<br><br>
- 44 -<br>
case, a parameter is not designated.<br>
Next, referring to Figs. 18 and 19, a setting<br>
method of the document policy is described. Fig. 18 is a<br>
diagram showing an example of a screen for setting a<br>
fundamental document policy. In a fundamental document<br>
policy setting screen G400, for example, as the document<br>
category, "PERSONNEL" is set in a setting region 401, and<br>
as the secret level, "CONFIDENTIAL" is set in a setting<br>
region 402.<br>
In addition, plural policies 409, 419, •• are<br>
set by combinations of a user classification and a right<br>
level for documents of "PERSONNEL" and "CONFIDENTIAL".<br>
In the policy 409, as the user classification,<br>
"RELATED PERSONS" is set in a setting region 403, and as<br>
the right level, "ANY" is set in a setting region 404.<br>
In a selection region 405 of the policy 409,<br>
"READ" and "PRINT" are set by an administrator, and since<br>
"COPY", "SCAN", and "FACSIMILE" are not set in real rime by<br>
the administrator, those are set beforehand.<br>
In a setting region 406, an obligation is set<br>
corresponding to each in the selection region 405. For<br>
example, in the setting region 406 corresponding to "PRINT",<br>
as the obligation, "COPY PROTECTION AGAINST UNAUTHORIZED<br>
COPY" is set.<br>
In addition, in a setting region 407, a pattern<br><br>
- 45 -<br>
policy to be applied is set. For example, "REGULAR STAFF<br>
CAN COPY/SCAN" is set. With this, the pattern policy is<br>
specified for "COPY PROTECTION AGAINST UNAUTHORIZED COPY"<br>
in "PRINT" of the selection region 405. "REGULAR STAFF CAN<br>
COPY/SCAN" relates to "3" in a security pattern No.<br>
described in Fig. 19.<br>
In the policy 419, as the user classification in<br>
a setting region 413, "EXCEPT RELATED PERSONS" is set, and<br>
as the right level in setting region 414, "ANY" is set.<br>
Similar to the policy 409, in the policy 419,<br>
since "COPY", "SCAN", and "FACSIMILE" are not controlled in<br>
real rime by the administrator, those are set beforehand in<br>
a selection region 415.<br>
In a setting region 416, an obligation is set<br>
corresponding to each in the selection region 415. For<br>
example, in the setting region 416 corresponding to "COPY"<br>
and "SCAN", as the obligation, "ALERT MAIL" is set; and in<br>
the setting region 416 corresponding to "FACSIMILE", as the<br>
obligation, "STORE IMAGE LOG" is set.<br>
In addition, in a setting region 417, a pattern<br>
policy to be applied is set. For example, as the contents<br>
to be written in the alert mail (corresponds to a parameter<br>
of an obligation), "%o is applied to this document by %u<br>
(data and time %d)" is displayed. For the %o, a function<br>
name is substituted, for the %u, a user name is substituted,<br><br>
- 46 -<br>
and for the %d, the date and time are substituted.<br>
Fig. 19 is a diagram showing an example of a<br>
screen for setting a policy for a paper document. In a<br>
paper document policy setting screen G500, for example, as<br>
the security pattern No., "3" is set in a setting region<br>
501, and as a pattern policy name, "ONLY REGULAR PERSONS<br>
CAN COPY/SCAN" is set in a setting region 502.<br>
In addition, plural policies 509, 519, ••• are<br>
set corresponding to the right levels for the security<br>
pattern No. "3".<br>
In the policy 509, as the right level, for<br>
example, "REGULAR STAFFS" is set in a setting region 503.<br>
In a selection region 505 of the policy 509,<br>
"COPY" and "SCAN" are set by an administrator.<br>
In a setting region 506, an obligation is set<br>
corresponding to each in the selection region 505. For<br>
example, in the setting region 506 corresponding to "COPY",<br>
as the obligation, "ALERT MAIL" is set, and in the setting<br>
region 506 corresponding to "SCAN", as the obligation,<br>
"IMAGE ANALYSIS (to be obliged by document policy)" is set.<br>
In addition, in a setting region 507<br>
corresponding to "COPY", as the contents to be written in<br>
the alert mail (corresponds to a parameter of an<br>
obligation), "%o is applied to this document by %u (data<br>
and time %d)" is displayed. For the %o, a function name is<br><br>
- 47 -<br>
substituted, for the %u, a user name is substituted, and<br>
for the %d, the date and time are substituted.<br>
In addition, in a policy 519, for example, as the<br>
right level, when "TEMPORARY STAFF" is set in a setting<br>
region 513, in a selection region 515 and a setting region<br>
516, nothing is set.<br>
Similar to in the policies 509 and 519, in a<br>
policy 520, settings are executed.<br>
Next, referring to Fig. 20, a structure of the<br>
document security attribute database 24 is described. Fig.<br>
20 is a diagram showing an example of the structure of the<br>
document security attribute database 24. As shown in Fig.<br>
20, the structure of the document security attribute<br>
database 24 includes items of "DOCUMENT ID" (document<br>
identifying information) for identifying a document,<br>
"CATEGORY" for signifying a using range of the document,<br>
"LEVEL" for signifying a secret level of the document,<br>
"RELATED_PERSONS" for signifying persons (sections) using<br>
the document, "ADMINISTRATORS" for signifying<br>
administrators of the document, and so on.<br>
In the "DOCUMENT ID", information for identifying<br>
documents, for example, SEC000123, SEC000124, and so on are<br>
registered. In the "CATEGORY", for example, "PERSONNEL"<br>
for signifying a personnel section is set. In the "LEVEL",<br>
for example, "SECRET" for signifying confidential and<br><br>
- 48 -<br>
"TOP_SECRET" for signifying a top secret are set. In the<br>
"RELATEDJPERSONS", sections such as "Personnel_Section_l",<br>
"Personnel_Section_2", "Personnel_Managers" are set. In<br>
the "ADMINISTRATORS", the names of the administrators, for<br>
example, "aoki" and "yamada" are set.<br>
For example, in a document identified by<br>
"SEC000123" in "DOCUMENT ID", since the "CATEGORY" is<br>
"PERSONNEL" and "LEVEL" is "SECRET", "RELATED_PERSONS" is<br>
restricted to persons in "Personnel_Section_l" and<br>
"Personnel_Section_2". In addition, the administrators of<br>
the document identified by "SEC000123" are "aoki" and<br>
"yamada".<br>
Next, referring to Fig. 21, processes to be<br>
executed by the scanning program 3P are described. Fig. 21<br>
is a diagram showing the processes to be executed by the<br>
scanning program 3P.<br>
First, the scanning program 3P receives user<br>
authentication information (user name and user password)<br>
from a user 9 (S201).<br>
Then the scanning program 3P sends the user<br>
authentication information to the user authentication<br>
server 10 and receives a user authenticated result from the<br>
user authentication server 10 (S202), and determines<br>
whether the user 9 is authenticated (S203). When the user<br>
9 is not authenticated, the scanning program 3P displays a<br><br>
- 49 -<br>
user authentication error on an operating panel of the<br>
digital multifunctional apparatus 3 and ends the processes<br>
(S204) .<br>
When the user 9 is authenticated, the scanning<br>
program 3P displays a main screen for scanning on the<br>
operating panel of the digital multifunctional apparatus 3<br>
(S205). When the scanning program 3P receives a scanning<br>
start request from the user 9 (S206), the scanning program<br>
3P sends a device using right determination request; which<br>
includes the user authenticated result, the device ID (ID<br>
No. of the digital multifunctional apparatus 3), the type<br>
of access (scanning); to the policy server B 30, and<br>
receives a device using right determined result from the<br>
policy server B 30 (S207).<br>
The scanning program 3P determines whether the<br>
device using right determined result shows successful<br>
(S208). When the device using right determined result does<br>
not show successful, the scanning program 3P displays a<br>
device using right error on the operating panel of the<br>
digital multifunctional apparatus 3 and ends the processes<br>
(S209).<br>
When the device using right determined result<br>
shows successful, the scanning program 3P starts to scan<br>
the paper manuscript 3a (S210). Then the scanning program<br>
3P detects a background pattern of scanned data generated<br><br>
- 50 -<br>
by scanning the paper manuscript 3a and sets the background<br>
pattern as a detection pattern ID (S211). When the<br>
scanning program 3P cannot detect the background pattern<br>
(S212), the scanning program 3P sets "UNKNOWN" in the<br>
detection pattern ID (S213).<br>
After setting that the background pattern is the<br>
detection pattern ID, the scanning program 3P sends a<br>
document using right determination request, which includes<br>
the user authenticated result, the detection pattern ID,<br>
the scanned data, the type of access (scanning), and the<br>
device using right determined result, to the policy server<br>
A 20 and receives a document using right determined result<br>
from the policy server A 20 (S214).<br>
Then the scanning program 3P determines whether<br>
the document using right determined result shows successful<br>
(S215). When the document using right determined result<br>
does not show successful, the scanning program 3P displays<br>
a document using right error on the operating panel of the<br>
digital multifunctional apparatus 3 and ends the processes<br>
(S216) .<br>
When the document using right determined result<br>
shows successful, the scanning program 3P executes an<br>
obligation which is included in the document using right<br>
determined result (S217). The scanning program 3P<br>
determines whether the obligation is executed (S218). When<br><br>
- 51 -<br>
the obligation cannot be executed, the scanning program 3P<br>
displays a policy control error on the operating panel of<br>
the digital multifunctional apparatus 3 and ends the<br>
processes (S219).<br>
When the obligation can be executed, the scanning<br>
program 3P outputs the scanned data to a designated<br>
destination (S220). Then the scanning program 3P displays<br>
a scanning completion message on the operating panel of the<br>
digital multifunctional apparatus 3 and ends the processes<br>
(S221) .<br>
Next, referring to Figs. 22 and 23, processes to<br>
be executed by the policy server A 20 are described. Fig.<br>
22 is a diagram showing processes to be executed by the<br>
policy server A 20. Fig. 23 is a diagram showing processes<br>
to be executed after the processes shown in Fig. 22 by the<br>
policy server A 20. That is, the processes shown in Figs.<br>
22 and 23 are continuously executed.<br>
In Fig. 22, first, the policy server A 20<br>
receives a document using right determination request,<br>
which includes the user authenticated result, the detection<br>
pattern ID, the scanned data, the type of access, the<br>
device using right determined result, from the scanning<br>
program 3P of the digital multifunctional apparatus 3<br>
(S231) .<br>
The policy server A program 22 of the policy<br><br>
- 52 -<br>
server A 20 reads a document security policy 21 (S232), and<br>
specifies the right level of the user 9 based on the user<br>
authenticated result (S233).<br>
The policy server A program 22 searches for<br><policy> in which <category> of <resource> is "PAPER"<br>
(paper manuscript), <level> is the detection pattern ID in<br>
the document using right determination request, <level> of<br><subject> is a specific user right level or "ANY", and<br><actions> is the type of the access in the document using<br>
right determination request or "ANY" (S234).<br>
Then the policy server A program 22 determines<br>
that a searched Effect value (Permit/Deny) in <rule> of<br><policy> and <obligation> are a document using right<br>
determined result (S235). The policy server A 20<br>
determines whether the document using right determined<br>
result shows permission (S236). When the document using<br>
right determined result does not show permission, the<br>
policy server A 20 sends the document using right<br>
determined result to the scanning program 3P and ends the<br>
processes (S237).<br>
When the document using right determined result<br>
shows permission, the policy server A program 22 merges the<br>
obligation in the device using right determined result with<br>
the obligation in the document using right determined<br>
result (S238).<br><br>
- 53 -<br>
Next, the policy server A program 22 determines<br>
whether the obligations are merged (S239). When the<br>
obligations cannot be merged, the policy server A program<br>
22 changes the document using right determined result to<br>
non-permission, sends the changed document using right<br>
determined result to the scanning program 3P, and ends the<br>
processes (S240).<br>
When the obligations are merged, the policy<br>
server A program 22 sets the merged obligation in the<br>
obligation of the document using right determined result<br>
(S241). Then the policy server A program 22 sends the<br>
document using right determined result to the scanning<br>
program 3P (S242) .<br>
In Fig. 23, the policy server A program 22<br>
determines whether <obligation> in <policy> searched in<br>
S235 is "REFER_PRIMARY_POLICY" (S243). When <obligation><br>
in <policy> searched in S235 is "REFER_PRIMARY_POLICY", the<br>
policy server A 20 sends a content analyzing request<br>
including the scanned data to the content analyzing server<br>
40 and receives an estimated security attribute (S244).<br>
The policy server A program 22 determines whether<br>
a document ID is included in the received security<br>
attribute (S245). When the document ID is included in the<br>
received security attribute, the policy server A program 22<br>
searches for a record suitable to the document ID in the<br><br>
- 54 -<br>
document security attribute database 24 (S246). Then the<br>
policy server A program 22 obtains the document category,<br>
the secret level, and the list of the related persons<br>
registered in the record; and sets the document category<br>
and the secret level in the security attribute (S247).<br>
The policy server A program 22 collates the user<br>
authenticated result with the list of the related persons<br>
and determines whether the user 9 is in the list of the<br>
related persons (S248). When the user 9 is in the list of<br>
the related persons, the policy server A program 22 sets<br>
"RELATED_PERSONS" in the user category (S250), and goes to<br>
S253. When the user 9 is not in the list of the related<br>
persons, the policy server A program 22 sets "ANY" in the<br>
user category (S251), and goes to S253.<br>
When the document ID is not included in the<br>
security attribute in S245, the policy server A program 22<br>
sets "ANY" in the user category (S252), and goes to S253.<br>
Next, the policy server A program 22 refers to<br>
the document security policy 21 and specifies <policy> in<br>
the following method. That is, in the specified <policy>,<br><category> and <level> of <resource> match with the<br>
estimated security attribute, <category> and <level> of<br><subject> match with the category and the right level of<br>
the user 9, and <actions> matches with the type of access<br>
in the document using right determination request (S253) .<br><br>
- 55 -<br>
Then the policy server A program 22 executes the<br>
contents of <obligation> in <policy> (S254), and ends the<br>
processes.<br>
When <obligation> in <policy> searched in S235 is<br>
not "REFER_PRIMARY_POLICY" in S243, the policy server A<br>
program 22 executes <obligation> in <policy> and ends the<br>
processes.<br>
In S112 of the sequence chart shown in Fig. 11,<br>
the document using right determination request includes the<br>
scanned data which request is sent from the scanning<br>
program 3P to the policy server A program 22.<br>
When the scanned data are included, the number of<br>
sending times of data from the scanning program 3P to the<br>
policy server A program 22 can be small. However, when it<br>
can be instantly determined that the user 9 does not have<br>
the document using right, since the scanned data are always<br>
sent, efficiency may be lowered. In order to prevent the<br>
efficiency from being lowered, a case is described. In<br>
this case, the scanned data are sent to the policy server A<br>
program 22 right before the end of the scanning processes.<br>
Fig. 24 is a sequence chart showing processes to<br>
scan the paper manuscript 3a in which scanned data are sent<br>
to the policy server A program 22 right before the end of<br>
the scanning processes. In Fig. 24, a request to a program<br>
is executed by a function call (continuous line), and a<br><br>
- 56 -<br>
result processed by the function call is returned as a<br>
return value (dashed line).<br>
Referring to Fig. 24, the processes are described.<br>
First, the user 9 requests to authenticate the user 9 by<br>
inputting user authentication information on the operating<br>
panel of the digital multifunctional apparatus 3 (S301).<br>
The scanning program 3P of the digital multifunctional<br>
apparatus 3 sends the request including the user<br>
authentication information to the user authentication<br>
server 10 (S302).<br>
The user authentication program 12 in the user<br>
authentication server 10 authenticates the user 9 based on<br>
the user authentication information received from the<br>
digital multifunctional apparatus 3 (S303) , and returns the<br>
user authenticated result to the scanning program 3P (S304).<br>
When the user authenticated result shows<br>
successful, the scanning program 3P displays the main<br>
screen on the digital multifunctional apparatus 3 (S305).<br>
When the user authenticated result does not show successful,<br>
the scanning program 3P informs the user 9 of non-<br>
authentication and does not execute the processes by the<br>
user 9.<br>
The user 9 sends a paper manuscript scanning<br>
request to the digital multifunctional apparatus 3 by<br>
putting on the paper manuscript 3a thereon (S306). In<br><br>
- 57 -<br>
order to determine whether the user 9 has a right to use<br>
the digital multifunctional apparatus 3, the scanning<br>
program 3P of the digital multifunctional apparatus 3 sends<br>
a device using right determination request to the policy<br>
server B 30 to determine whether the user 9 has the device<br>
using right based on the paper manuscript scanning request<br>
(S307). In the device using right determination request,<br>
the user authenticated result, the device information, and<br>
the type of access (in this case, scanning) are designated.<br>
The policy server B program 32 in the policy<br>
server B 30 determines whether the user 9 has the device<br>
using right by referring to the device security policy 31<br>
and information in the device security attribute database<br>
34 (S308), and returns the determined result to the<br>
scanning program 3P as the device using right determined<br>
result (corresponding to the policy determined result B<br>
shown in Fig. 8) (S309).<br>
When the user 9 does not have the device using<br>
right, the scanning program 3P informs the user 9 of that<br>
the user 9 does not have the device using right for<br>
scanning the paper manuscript 3a and ends the processes.<br>
When the user 9 has the device using right, the scanning<br>
program 3P scans the paper manuscript 3a (S310). Then the<br>
scanning program 3P detects the background pattern of the<br>
paper manuscript 3a from data scanned the paper manuscript<br><br>
- 58 -<br>
3a (S311).<br>
In order to determine whether the user 9 has a<br>
document using right, the scanning program 3P sends a<br>
document using right determination request to the policy<br>
server A 20 (S312). The document using right determination<br>
request includes the user authenticated result, real time<br>
detected information by the background pattern detection in<br>
S311, the type of the access (in this case, scanning), the<br>
device using right determined result (corresponding to the<br>
policy determined result B shown in Fig. 8). That is, the<br>
document using right determination request does not include<br>
the scanned data.<br>
The policy server A program 22 in the policy<br>
server A 20 determines whether the user 9 has the document<br>
using right by referring to the document security policy 21<br>
and information in the document security attribute database<br>
24 (S313).<br>
The policy server A program 22 in the policy<br>
server A 20 merges obligations designated by the document<br>
using right determined result and the device using right<br>
determined result by referring to the table TBL 50 shown in<br>
Fig. 9 and the obligation merging rule shown in Fig. 10<br>
(S314) .<br>
The policy server A program 22 in the policy<br>
server A 20 sends the document using right determined<br><br>
- 59 -<br>
result to the digital multifunctional apparatus 3 (S315) .<br>
When the scanning program 3P receives the<br>
document using right determined result from the policy-<br>
server A program 22, the scanning program 3P executes the<br>
obligation designated by the document using right<br>
determined result (S316), and sends a detail policy<br>
determination process request including the scanned data to<br>
the policy server A program 22 in the policy server A 20<br>
(S317) .<br>
The processes by the detail policy determination<br>
process request includes a content analyzing process (S319),<br>
a follow-up obligation determination process (S321), and a<br>
follow-up obligation executing process (S322).<br>
When the policy server A program 22 receives the<br>
detail policy determination process request including the<br>
scanned data from the scanning program 3P, the policy<br>
server A program 22 obtains the scanned data included in<br>
the detail policy determination process request, and sends<br>
the scanned data to the content analyzing server 40 (S318).<br>
The content analyzing program 42 in the content<br>
analyzing server 40 analyzes the contents of the scanned<br>
data (S319), and returns the analyzed result to the policy<br>
server A program 22 as the security attribute (S320).<br>
The policy server A program 22 executes a follow-<br>
up obligation determination process based on the security<br><br>
- 60 -<br>
attribute (S321), and executes a follow-up obligation<br>
process based on the follow-up obligation determined result<br>
(S322). For example, alert mail is sent to the<br>
administrator.<br>
In the digital multifunctional apparatus 3, after<br>
sending the detail policy determination process request<br>
including the scanned data to the policy server A 20, the<br>
scanning program 3P executes a scanning completion process<br>
(S117-2).<br>
The scanning program 3P sends a scanning<br>
completion notice to the user 9 as a return value for the<br>
request (S306) of scanning the paper manuscript 3a (S317-4) .<br>
Then the digital multifunctional apparatus 3 displays the<br>
scanning completion on the operating panel and the user 9<br>
recognizes the scanning completion.<br>
For example, in the sequence chart shown in Fig.<br>
24, after sending the detail policy determination process<br>
request to the policy server A program 22, only when<br>
"REFER_PRIMARY_POLICY" signifying that a primary policy is<br>
referred to is designated, the scanned data are sent to the<br>
policy server A 20, and the contents of the scanned data<br>
are analyzed.<br>
Referring to Figs. 25 through 27, processes of a<br>
case are described. In this case, after executing an<br>
obligation, a detail policy determination process is<br><br>
- 61 -<br>
executed.<br>
Fig. 25 is a diagram showing processes to be<br>
executed by the scanning program 3P in a case where a<br>
detail policy determination process is executed after<br>
executing an obligation. In Fig. 25, the same step as that<br>
shown in Fig. 21 has the same step number and the<br>
description thereof is omitted. That is, the descriptions<br>
from S201 through S213 are omitted.<br>
After detecting the background pattern of the<br>
scanned data and setting that the background pattern is the<br>
detection pattern ID (S211 through S213), the scanning<br>
program 3P sends a document using right determination<br>
request, which includes the user authenticated result, the<br>
detection pattern ID, the type of the access (scanning),<br>
and the device using right determined result, to the policy<br>
server A 20 and receives a document using right determined<br>
result from the policy server A 20 (S214-5). In this case,<br>
the scanned data are not included in the document using<br>
right determination request.<br>
Then the scanning program 3P determines whether<br>
the document using right determined result shows successful<br>
(S215-5). When the document using right determined result<br>
does not show successful, the scanning program 3P displays<br>
a document using right error on the operating panel of the<br>
digital multifunctional apparatus 3 and ends the processes<br><br>
- 62 -<br>
(S216-5).<br>
When the document using right determined result<br>
shows successful, the scanning program 3P executes an<br>
obligation which is included in the document using right<br>
determined result (S217-5). The scanning program 3P<br>
determines whether the obligation is executed (S218-5).<br>
When the obligation cannot be executed, the scanning<br>
program 3P displays a policy control error on the operating<br>
panel of the digital multifunctional apparatus 3 and ends<br>
the processes (S219-5).<br>
When the obligation can be executed, the scanning<br>
program 3P determines whether "REFER_PRIMARY_POLICY" is<br>
included in the obligation (S220-5). When<br>
"REFER_PRIMARY_POLICY" is included in the obligation, the<br>
scanning program 3P sends a detail policy determination<br>
process request; which includes the user authenticated<br>
result, the scanned data, and the type of access<br>
(scanning); to policy server A 20 (S221-5).<br>
After executing the obligation, the scanning<br>
program 3P outputs the scanned data to a designated<br>
destination (S222-5). Then the scanning program 3P<br>
displays a scanning completion message on the operating<br>
panel of the digital multifunctional apparatus 3 and ends<br>
the processes (S223-5).<br>
Fig. 26 is a diagram showing processes of the<br><br>
- 63 -<br>
document using right determination process to be executed<br>
by the policy server A program 22 in a case where a detail<br>
policy determination process is executed after executing an<br>
obligation. In Fig. 26, the same step as that shown in Fig.<br>
22 has the same step number and the description thereof is<br>
omitted. That is, the descriptions from S231 through S241<br>
are omitted.<br>
In the document using right determination process<br>
shown in Fig. 26, the policy server A program 22 executes<br>
the processes from S231 through s241, and sends the<br>
document using right determined result to the scanning<br>
program 3P without executing S243 through S255 shown in Fig.<br>
23, and ends the processes (S242-5).<br>
Fig. 27 is a diagram showing processes in the<br>
detail policy determination process to be executed by the<br>
policy server A program 22 after executing an obligation.<br>
In Fig. 27, the same step as that shown in Fig. 23 has the<br>
same step number and the description thereof is omitted.<br>
In the detail policy determination process shown<br>
in Fig. 27, the policy server A program 22 receives a<br>
detail policy determination process request, which includes<br>
the user authenticated result, the scanned data, and the<br>
type of access (scanning), from the scanning program 3P of<br>
the digital multifunctional apparatus 3 (S243-2).<br>
After receiving the detail policy determination<br><br>
- 64 -<br>
process request, the policy server A program 22 reads the<br>
document security policy 21 (S243-4). In addition, the<br>
policy server A program 22 specifies the level of the user<br>
right based on the user authenticated result (S243-6).<br>
After this, the policy server A program 22<br>
executes the processes similar to those from S244 through<br>
S253 shown in Fig. 23, executes the contents of specified<br><obligation> of <policy>, and ends the processes (S254-5).<br>
Next, specific examples are described. In a<br>
first example, in the document security system 100, Mr.<br>
Sakai of a regular staff copies a paper manuscript 3a<br>
(general document) by using the digital multifunctional<br>
apparatus 3 identified by "MFP000123" in a development<br>
section.<br>
In this case, Mr. Sakai is not a related person<br>
"RELATED_PERSON" of the digital multifunctional apparatus 3<br>
identified by "MFP000123"; however, Mr. Sakai is permitted<br>
to copy the general document. However, "ALERT_MAIL" is an<br>
obligation. In this case, alert mail 51 shown in Fig. 28<br>
is sent to an administrator.<br>
Fig. 28 is a diagram showing an example of the<br>
alert mail 5 1 which is sent to an administrator as an<br>
obligation when a general document is copied. In the alert<br>
mail 51 shown in Fig. 28, for example, a message<br>
"ALERT MAIL SAKAI COPIED BY MFP000123 (DATE &amp; TIME<br><br>
- 65 -<br>
20051208173522)" is displayed.<br>
In a second example, in the document security<br>
system 100, Mr. Sakai of a regular staff copies a paper<br>
document 2c by using the digital multifunctional apparatus<br>
3 identified by "MFP000123" in a development section. The<br>
paper document 2c is formed by printing a secured document<br>
lc identified by "SEC000123" which is a confidential<br>
document in a personnel section. In the paper document 2c<br>
printed from the secured document lc, a copy protection for<br>
preventing an unauthorized copy of a pattern No.3 is<br>
printed.<br>
In this case, Mr. Sakai is not a related person<br>
"RELATED_PERSON" of the digital multifunctional apparatus 3<br>
identified by "MFP000123"; however, Mr. Sakai may be<br>
permitted to copy the paper document 2c corresponding to<br>
the device security policy 31. However, "ALERT_MAIL" is an<br>
obligation.<br>
However, when Mr. Sakai copies the paper document<br>
2c by using the digital multifunctional apparatus 3<br>
identified by "MFP000123", the pattern No. 3 is detected<br>
from the paper document 2c. Therefore, it is determined<br>
whether Mr. Sakai can copy the paper document 2c based on<br>
the document security policy 21. Since Mr. Sakai is a<br>
regular staff, Mr. Sakai can copy the paper document 2c;<br>
however, alert mail is an obligation.<br><br>
- 66 -<br>
In this case, the obligation by the device<br>
security policy 31 and the obligation by the document<br>
security policy 21 (policy for the secured document 1c) are<br>
merged. Then alert mail shown in Fig. 29 is sent to an<br>
administrator.<br>
Fig. 2 9 is a diagram showing an example of alert<br>
mail 52 which is sent to an administrator as an obligation<br>
when a paper document 2c printed from a secured document lc<br>
is copied. In the alert mail 52 shown in Fig. 29, for<br>
example, a message "ALERT_MAIL, SAKAI COPIED BY MFP000123<br>
(DATE &amp; TIME 20051208173522), SAKAI COPIED PAPER DOCUMENT<br>
WHICH CAN BE COPIED/SCANNED BY REGULAR STAFF AT MFP000123<br>
(DATE &amp; TIME 20051208173522)" is displayed.<br>
In a third example, in the document security<br>
system 100, Mr. Sakai of a regular staff scans a paper<br>
document 2c by using the digital multifunctional apparatus<br>
3 identified by "MFP000123" in a development section. In<br>
this case, the paper document 2c is different from that in<br>
the second example. The paper document 2c is formed by<br>
printing an original document lb of a secured document lc<br>
identified by "SEC000123" which is a confidential document<br>
in a personnel section. In the paper document 2c printed<br>
from the original document lb, a pattern is not printed.<br>
In this case, since Mr. Sakai is not a related<br>
person "RELATED_PERSON" of the digital multifunctional<br><br>
- 67 -<br>
apparatus 3 identified by "MFP000123", an image analysis is<br>
applied to scanned data obtained from scanning the paper<br>
document 2c based on the document security policy 21 as an<br>
obligation.<br>
From the image analysis, when it is determined<br>
that the paper document 2c is a confidential document in<br>
the personnel section identified by "SEC000123" and Mr.<br>
Sakai is not a related person to the personnel section,<br>
alert mail shown in Fig. 30 is sent to an administrator as<br>
a follow-up obligation based on the document security<br>
policy 21.<br>
Fig. 30 is a diagram showing an example of alert<br>
mail 53 which is sent to an administrator as a follow-up<br>
obligation when a paper document 2c printed from an<br>
original document lb is scanned. In the alert mail 53<br>
shown in Fig. 30, for example, a message "ALERT_MAIL, SAKAI<br>
SCANNED THIS DOCUMENT (DATE &amp; TIME 20051208173522),<br>
ATTACHED FILE: 20051208173522.tif" is displayed. That is,<br>
the attached file "20051208173522.tif" is sent to the<br>
administrator together with the message.<br>
As described above, according to the embodiment<br>
of the present invention, in the document security system<br>
100, a process requested by a user is executed when the<br>
process is permitted from the device using right of the<br>
user and the document using right of the user, and an<br><br>
- 68 -<br>
obligation and a follow-up obligation are executed based on<br>
the type of the access obtained from the image data.<br>
Further, the present invention is not limited to<br>
the embodiment, but various variations and modifications<br>
may be made without departing from the scope of the present<br>
invention.<br>
