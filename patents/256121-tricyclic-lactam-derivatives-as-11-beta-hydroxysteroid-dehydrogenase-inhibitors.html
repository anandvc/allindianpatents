				<td>TRICYCLIC LACTAM DERIVATIVES AS 11-BETA HYDROXYSTEROID DEHYDROGENASE INHIBITORS<br>
The metabolic syndrome is a disease with increasing prevalence not only in the<br>
Western world but also in Asia and developing countries. It is characterised by obesity<br>
in particular central or visceral obesity, type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension,<br>
arteriosclerosis, coronary heart diseases and eventually chronic renal failure (C.T.<br>
Montague et al. (2000), Diabetes, 49, 883-888).<br>
Glucocorticoids and 11J3-HSD1 are known to be important factors in differentiation of<br>
adipose stromal cells into mature adipocytes. In the visceral stromal cells of obese<br>
patients, 11|3-HSD1 mRNA level is increased compared with subcutaneous tissue.<br>
Further, adipose tissue over-expression of 11P-HSD1 in transgenic mice is associated<br>
with increased corticosterone levels in the adipose tissue, visceral obesity, insulin<br>
sensitivity, Type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia and hyperphagia (H. Masuzaki et al (2001),<br>
Science, 294, 2166-2170). Therefore, 11P-HSD1 is most likely be involved in the<br>
development of visceral obesity and the metabolic syndrome.<br>
Inhibition of 11P-HSD1 results in a decrease in differentiation and an increase<br>
in proliferation of adipose stromal cells. Moreover, glucocorticoid deficiency<br>
(adrenalectomy) enhances the ability of insulin and leptin to promote anorexia and<br>
weight loss, and this effect is reversed by glucocorticoid administration (P.M. Stewart<br>
et al (2002), Trends Endocrin. Metabpl, 13, 94-96). These data suggest that enhanced<br>
reactivation of cortisone by 11P-HSD1 may exacerbate obesity and it may be beneficial<br>
to inhibit this enzyme in adipose tissue of obese patients.<br>
Obesity is also linked to cardiovascular risks. There is a significant relationship<br>
between cortisol excretion rate and HDL cholesterol in both men and women,<br>
suggesting that glucocorticoids regulate key components of cardiovascular risk. In<br>
analogy, aortic stiffness is also associated with visceral adiposity in older adults.<br>
The impact of the effect of decreased 11P-HSD1 activity is highlighted by the<br>
P-HSD1 knockout mouse that has increased plasma levels of endogenous active<br>
glucocorticoid, but inspite of this remains protected from insulin resistance induced by<br>
stress and obesity. Additionally, these knockout mouse present an anti-atherogenic<br>
plasmid lipid profile and benefits from decreased age-related cognitive impairement.<br>
Glucocorticoids and glaucoma<br>
Glucocorticoids increase the risk of glaucoma by raising the intraocular pressure when<br>
administered exogenously and in certain conditions of increased production like in<br>
Gushing's syndrome. Corticosteroid-induced elevation of intra ocular pressure is<br>
caused by increased resistance to aqueous outflow due to glucocorticoid induced<br>
changes in the trabecular meshwork and its intracellular matrix. Zhou et al. (Int J Mol<br>
Med (1998) 1, 339-346) also reported that corticosteroids increase the amounts of<br>
fibronectin as well as collagen type I and type IV in the trabecular meshwork of organcultured<br>
bovine anterior segments.<br>
11P-HSD1 is expressed in the basal cells of the corneal epithelium and the nonpigmented<br>
epithelial cells. Glucocorticoid receptor mRNA was only detected in the<br>
trabecular meshwork, whereas in the non-pigmented epithelial cells mRNA for the<br>
glucocorticoid-, mineralocorticoid receptor and 11J3-HSD1 was present. Carbenoxolone<br>
administration to patients resulted in a significant decrease in mtra-ocular pressure (S.<br>
Rauz et al. (2001), Invest. Ophtalmol. Vis. Science, 42, 2037-2042), suggesting a role<br>
for HSD1-inhibitors in treating glaucoma.<br>
Accordingly, the underlying problem to be solved by the present invention was to<br>
identify potent 11 (3-HSD inhibitors, with a high selectivity for 11 p-HSDl, and the use<br>
thereof in treating pathologies associated with excess cortisol formation, i.e. disorders<br>
where a decreased level of active glucocorticoid is desirable, such as metabolic<br>
syndrome, type 2 diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), impaired fasting glucose<br>
(IFG), dyslipidemia, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, obesity related cardiovascular<br>
diseases, arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis, myopathy, osteoporosis, neurodegenerative<br>
and psychiatric disorders, stress related disorders and glaucoma. As shown<br>
hereinbelow, the 3-substituted 2-pyrrolidinone derivatives of formula (I) were found to<br>
be useful as a medicine, in particular in the manufacture of a medicament for the<br>
treatment of pathologies associated with excess cortisol formation.<br>
Blommaert A. et al. (Heterocycles (2001), 55(12), 2273-2278) provides the preparation<br>
of piperidine- and pyrrolidinone-like polymer supported (R)-phenylglycinol-derived<br>
scaffolds and in particular discloses 2-Pyrrolidinone, l-[(lR)-2-hydroxy-lphenylethyl]-<br>
3-methyl-3-(phenyhnethyl)- and 2-Pyrrolidinone, l-[(lR)-2-hydroxy-lphenylethyl]-<br>
3-(phenylmethyl)-, (3R).<br>
Bausanne I. et al. (Tetrahedron: Assymetry (1998), 9(5), 797-804) provides the<br>
preparation of 3-substituted pyrrolidinones via oc-alkylation of a chiral non-racemic<br>
y-lacton and in particular discloses 1 -(2-hydroxy-1 -phenylethyl)-3-benzylpyrrolidin-2-<br>
one.<br>
US 2001/034343; US 6,211,199; US 6,194,406; WO 97/22604 and WO 97/19074 are a<br>
number of patent applications filed by Aventis Pharmaceuticals Inc. providing 4-(lHbenzimidazol-<br>
2-yl)[l,4]diazepanes useful for the treatment of allergic diseases. In<br>
these applications the 3-substituted pyrrolidinones of the present invention are<br>
disclosed as intermediates in the synthesis of said 4-(lH-benzimidazol-2-yl)[l,4]-<br>
diazepanes. These applications in particular disclose; 2-Pyrrolidinone, 3-[(4-fluorophenyl)<br>
methyl]-l-[(lS)-l-phenylethyl]- and 2-Pyrrolidinone, 3-[(4-fluorophenyl)-<br>
methy]]-l-[(lR)-l-phenylethyl]-.<br>
Adamantyl like compounds are also disclosed in PCT publication WO 03065983<br>
(Merck &amp; Co., Inc.) and WO 2004056744 (Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V.). Taking WO<br>
2004056744 as the closest prior art, the compounds of the present application differ in<br>
that the adamantyl ring is linked to a ring amide nitrogen being part of a tricyclic<br>
system. Notwithstanding the fact that WO 03065983 discloses that the adamantyl ring<br>
may be directly linked to a tricyclic ring system, it should be noted that said tricyclic<br>
ring systems are characterised in having 2-adamantyl-triazole as a core structural<br>
element and that it was accordingly not to be expected that replacing the triazole with a<br>
imidazolidinone or pyrrolidinone could be done without loss of the desired activity, i.e.<br>
potent 11 p-HSD inhibitors, with a selectivity for 11 (3-HSD1.<br>
Hence, in none of the cited documents the therapeutic application of the tricyclic<br>
adamantylamide derivatives of the present invention has been disclosed nor suggested.<br>

In order to simplify the representation of the compounds of formula (I) the group<br>
will hereinafter being referred to as -D.<br>
The "curved" tricyclic adamantylamide derivatives of the present invention, hereinafter<br>
referred to as the compounds of formula (I1), are generally prepared by condensing in a<br>
first step the commercially available benzocyclobutane carboxylic acid (II) with the<br>
appropriate amine under art known conditions (Scheme 1). Subsequently, the thus<br>
obtained amide (III) is reduced using for example, lithium aluminium hydride or borane<br>
dimethyl sulphide complex, to give the amine of formula (IV). Finally, said amine is<br>
acylated with acroyl chloride followed by a cyclisation reaction, under art known<br>
procedures, such as for example by heating the amide (V) in toluene at 190°C, to yield<br>
a mixture of the cis and trans isomers of the "curved" tricyclic adamantylamide<br>
derivatives of the present invention.<br>
wherein R2 is defined as for the compounds of formula (I) hereinbefore.<br>
To obtain the stereoisomers of the "curved" tricyclic adamantylamide derivatives of<br>
formula (I1) hereinbefore, the commercially available benzocyclobutane carboxylic acid<br>
(II) is condensed with allyl-2-adamantyl-amine (VI) to yield the amide of general<br>
formula (VII), which upon electrocyclic ring closure afforded the "curved" tricyclic<br>
adamantylamide derivatives of formula (I") (Scheme 2).<br>
wherein R1 and R2 are defined as for the compounds of formula (I) hereinbefore.<br>
Those compounds of formula (I) wherein X represents N, hereinafter referred to as the<br>
ureas of formula (I1U) are generally prepared according to reaction schemes 3 and 4<br>
hereinafter. In a first alternative, the ureas are prepared starting from commercially<br>
available Boc-protected tetrahydroquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (both enantiomers),<br>
reaction with aminoadamantane and reduction of the amide gave the diamine of fomula<br>
(VIII). Subsequent cyclization under art known procedures gave the cyclic ureas of<br>
In a second alternative the urea derivatives are prepared by coupling the commercially<br>
available quinoline-2-carboxylic acids or isoquinoline-1-carboxylic acids with the<br>
appropriate amine under art known procedures to yield the corresponding amide of<br>
formula (IX). Selective hydrogenation of the pyridine ring afforded the<br>
tetrahydro(iso)quinolines acetamides (X), which were reduced using for example,<br>
BH3.DMS in toluene to yield the diamines of general formula (XI). Subsequent<br>
cyclization, using for example carbonyl diimidazole (GDI) gave the cyclic ureas of<br>
wherein R2 is defined as for the compounds of formula (I) hereinbefore,<br>
-A-A- represents -N-CHj- or -CHz-N- and -A=A- represents -N=CHor-<br>
CH=N-.<br>
In those cases where the substituted isoquinoline-1-carboxylic acids were not<br>
commercially available, the substituted tricyclic derivatives were built up starting from<br>
phenethylarnines (XII) and ethylchloroformate (Scheme 5). The created carbamate was<br>
cyclized using art known procedures, such as for example the modified Bischler-<br>
Napierelski reaction (Larsen, Robert D., et al., A modified Bischler-Napieralski<br>
procedure for the synthesis of 3-aryl-3,4-dihydroisoquinolines., Journal of Organic<br>
Chemistry (1991), 56(21), 6034-8.), to give the ammo protected<br>
tetrahydroisoquinoline-1-carboxylic acid of formula (X'). The further synthesis of the<br>
substituted tricyclic derivatives is as described in reaction Scheme 4 hereinbefore.<br>
The "linear" tricyclic adamantylamide derivatives of formula (I1V) can be prepared<br>
according to reaction schemes 6 and 7 herein after. According to a first alternative the<br>
linear tricyclic adamantylamide derivatives are prepared starting from the aryl- or<br>
heteroaryl-substituted acrylic acid or acid chloride (XIII). Reaction with the<br>
appropriate amine gives the amide of formula (XFV), which upon electrocyclic ring<br>
closure under art known conditions, for example in toluene at 220°C, provides the<br>
tricyclic system of<br>
wherein A and R are defined as for the compounds of formula (I) hereinbefore.<br>
In a second alternative the "linear" tricyclic adamantylamide derivatives of formula<br>
(I1V) wherein A represents phenyl and Y represents N, can be prepared by coupling the<br>
amino protected D or L-phenylalanine with the appropriate amine to give the aaminoamide<br>
of formula (XV), see for example the reaction conditions as described in<br>
J.Org.Chem. 2002, 67, 8224. Deprotection followed by Mannich condensation with<br>
benzotriazole and formaldehyde provides the intermediate of formula (XVI).<br>
Electrocyclic ring closure provides the "linear" tricyclic adamantylamide derivatives of<br>
(Figure Removed)  Further examples for the synthesis of compounds of formula (I) using anyone of the<br>
above-mentioned synthesis methods, are provided in the experimental part hereinafter.<br>
Where, necessary or desired, any one or more of the following further steps in any order<br>
may be performed:<br>
(i) removing any remaining protecting group(s);<br>
(ii) converting a compound of formula (I) or a protected form thereof into a further<br>
compound of formula (I) or a protected form thereof;<br>
(iii) converting a compound of formula (I) or a protected form thereof into a JV-oxide, a<br>
salt, a quaternary amine or a solvate of a compound of formula (I) or a protected<br>
form thereof;<br>
(iv) converting a Af-oxide, a salt, a quaternary amine or a solvate of a compound of<br>
formula (I) or a protected form thereof into a compound of formula (I) or a protected<br>
form thereof;<br>
(v) converting a N-oxide, a salt, a quaternary amine or a solvate of a compound of<br>
formula (I) or a protected form thereof into another A^-oxide, a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable addition salt a quaternary amine or a solvate of a compound of formula<br>
(I) or a protected form thereof;<br>
 (vi) where the compound of formula (I) is obtained as a mixture of (R) and (S)<br>
enantiomers resolving the mixture to obtain the desired enantiomer.<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that in the processes described above<br>
the functional groups of intermediate compounds may need to be blocked by protecting<br>
groups.<br>
Functional groups which it is desirable to protect include hydroxy, amino and<br>
carboxylic acid. Suitable protecting groups for hydroxy include trialkylsilyl groups<br>
(e.g. tert-butyldimethylsilyl, tert-butyldiphenylsilyl or trimethylsilyl), benzyl and<br>
tetrahydropyranyl. Suitable protecting groups for amino include tert-butyloxycarbonyl<br>
or benzyloxycarbonyl. Suitable protecting groups for carboxylic acid include C^alkyl<br>
or benzyl esters.<br>
The protection and deprotection of functional groups may take place before or after a<br>
reaction step.<br>
The use of protecting groups is fully described in 'Protective Groups in Organic<br>
Synthesis' 2nd edition, T W Greene &amp; P G M Wutz, Wiley Interscience (1991).<br>
Additionally, the N-atoms in compounds of formula (I) can be methylated by artknown<br>
methods using CHs-T in a suitable solvent such as, for example 2-propanone,<br>
tetrahydroiiiran or dimethylformamide.<br>
The compounds of formula (I), can also.be converted into each other following artknown<br>
procedures of functional group transformation of which some examples are<br>
mentioned hereinabove.<br>
The compounds of formula (I), may also be converted to the corresponding AT-oxide<br>
forms following art-known procedures for converting a trivalent nitrogen into its<br>
N-oxide form. Said JV-oxidation reaction may generally be carried out by reacting the<br>
starting material of formula (I) with 3-phenyl-2-(phenylsulfonyl)oxaziridine or with an<br>
appropriate organic or inorganic peroxide. Appropriate inorganic peroxides comprise,<br>
for example, hydrogen peroxide, alkali metal or earth alkaline metal peroxides, e.g.<br>
sodium peroxide, potassium peroxide; appropriate organic peroxides may comprise<br>
peroxy acids such as, for example, benzenecarboperoxoic acid or halo substituted<br>
benzenecarboperoxoic acid, e.g. 3-chlorobenzenecarboperoxoic acid, peroxoalkanoic<br>
acids, e.g. peroxoacetic acid, alkylhydroperoxides, e.g. t-butyl hydroperoxide. Suitable<br>
solvents are, for example, water, lower alkanols, e.g. ethanol and the like, hydrocarbons,<br>
e.g. toluene, ketones, e.g. 2-butanone, halogenated hydrocarbons, e.g.<br>
dichloromethane, and mixtures of such solvents.<br>
Pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I), may be<br>
obtained by the application of art-known procedures. Diastereomers may be separated<br>
by physical methods such as selective crystallization and chromatographic techniques,<br>
e.g. counter-current distribution, liquid chromatography and the like.<br>
Some of the compounds of formula (I), and some of the intermediates in the present<br>
invention may contain an asymmetric carbon atom. Pure stereochemically isomeric<br>
forms of said compounds and said intermediates can be obtained by the application of<br>
art-known procedures. For example, diastereoisomers can be separated by physical<br>
methods such as selective crystallization or chromatographic techniques, e.g. counter<br>
current distribution, liquid chromatography and the like methods. Enantiomers can be<br>
obtained from racemic mixtures by first converting said racemic mixtures with suitable<br>
resolving agents such as, for example, chiral acids, to mixtures of diastereomeric salts<br>
or compounds; then physically separating said mixtures of diastereomeric salts or<br>
compounds by, for example, selective crystallization or chromatographic techniques,<br>
e.g. liquid chromatography and the like methods; and finally converting said separated<br>
diastereomeric salts or compounds into the corresponding enantiomers. Pure<br>
stereochemically isomeric forms may also be obtained from the pure stereochemically<br>
isomeric forms of the appropriate intermediates and starting materials, provided that the<br>
intervening reactions occur stereospecifically.<br>
An alternative manner of separating the enantiomeric forms of the compounds of<br>
formula (I) and intermediates involves liquid chromatography, in particular liquid<br>
chromatography using a chiral stationary phase.<br>
Some of the intermediates and starting materials as used in the reaction procedures<br>
mentioned hereinabove are known compounds and may be commercially available or<br>
may be prepared according to art-known procedures.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are useful because they possess<br>
pharmacological properties. They can therefore be used as medicines, in particular to<br>
treat pathologies associated with excess cortisol formation, i.e. disorders where a<br>
decreased level of active glucocorticoid is desirable, such as metabolic syndrome, type<br>
2 diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), impaired fasting glucose (IFG),<br>
dyslipidemia, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, obesity related cardiovascular diseases,<br>
arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis, myopathy, osteoporosis, neurodegenerative and<br>
psychiatric disorders, stress related disorders and glaucoma. In particular to treat<br>
pathologies such as for example, obesity, diabetes, type 2 diabetes, obesity related<br>
cardiovascular diseases, stress and glaucoma.<br>
As described in the experimental part hereinafter, the inhibitory effect of the present<br>
compounds on the 11 p-HSD 1 -reductase activity (conversion of cortisone into cortisol)<br>
has been demonstrated in vitro, in an enzymatic assay using the recombinant 1 Ib-<br>
HSD1 enzyme, by measuring the conversion of cortisone into cortisol using HPLC<br>
purification and quantification methods. 11 (3-HSD1 -reductase inhibition was also<br>
demonstrated in vitro, in a cell based assay comprising contacting the cells, expressing<br>
11(3-HSD1 with the compounds to be tested and assessing the effect of said compounds<br>
on the formation of cortisol in the cellular medium of these cells. The cells preferably<br>
used in an assay of the present invention are selected from the group consisting of<br>
mouse fibroblast 3T3-L1 cells, HepG2 cells, pig kidney cell, in particular LCC-PK1<br>
cells and rat hepatocytes.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides the compounds of formula (I) and their<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable JV-oxides, addition salts, quaternary amines and<br>
stereochemically isomeric forms for use in therapy. In particular to treat pathologies<br>
associated with excess cortisol formation, i.e. disorders where a decreased level of<br>
active glucocorticoid is desirable, such as metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes,<br>
impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), impaired fasting glucose (DFG), dyslipidemia,<br>
hypertension, obesity, diabetes, obesity related cardiovascular diseases, arteriosclerosis,<br>
atherosclerosis, myopathy, osteoporosis, neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders,<br>
stress related disorders and glaucoma. More particular to treat pathologies such as for<br>
example, obesity, diabetes, type 2 diabetes, obesity related cardiovascular diseases,<br>
stress and glaucoma. Even more particular in the treatment or prevention of<br>
pathologies associated with excess cortisol formation such as obesity, diabetes, obesity<br>
related cardiovascular diseases and glaucoma.<br>
In view of the utility of the compounds according to the invention, there is provided a<br>
method for the treatment of an animal, for example, a mammal including humans,<br>
suffering from a pathology associated with excess cortisol formation, which comprises<br>
administering an effective amount of a compound according to the present invention.<br>
Said method comprising the systemic or topical administration of an effective amount<br>
of a compound according to the invention, to warm-blooded animals, including<br>
humans.<br>
It is thus an object of the present invention to provide a compound according to the<br>
present invention for use as a medicine. In particular to use the compound according to<br>
the present invention in the manufacture of a medicament for treating pathologies<br>
associated with excess cortisol formation such as for example, metabolic syndrome,<br>
type 2 diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), impaired fasting glucose (IFG),<br>
dyslipidemia, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, obesity related cardiovascular diseases,<br>
arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis, myopathy, osteoporosis, neurodegenerative and<br>
psychiatric disorders, stress related disorders and glaucoma, in particular obesity,<br>
diabetes, obesity related cardiovascular diseases, stress and glaucoma.<br>
The amount of a compound according to the present invention, also referred to here as<br>
the active ingredient, which is required to achieve a therapeutical effect will be, of<br>
course, vary with the particular compound, the route of administration, the age and<br>
condition of the recipient, and the particular disorder or disease being treated. A<br>
suitable daily dose would be from 0.001 mg/kg to 500 mg/kg body weight, in particular<br>
from 0.005 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg body weight. A method of treatment may also include<br>
administering the active ingredient on a regimen of between one and four intakes per<br>
day.<br>
While it is possible for the active ingredient to be administered alone, it is preferable to<br>
present it as a pharmaceutical composition. Accordingly, the present invention further<br>
provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound according to the<br>
present invention, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. The<br>
carrier or diluent must be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other<br>
ingredients of the composition and not deleterious to the recipients thereof.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be prepared by any methods<br>
well known in the art of pharmacy, for example, using methods such as those described<br>
in Gennaro et al. Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (18th ed., Mack Publishing<br>
Company, 1990, see especially Part 8 : Pharmaceutical preparations and their<br>
Manufacture). A therapeutically effective amount of the particular compound, in base<br>
form or addition salt form, as the active ingredient is combined in intimate admixture<br>
with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which may take a wide variety of forms<br>
depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical<br>
compositions are desirably in unitary dosage form suitable, preferably, for systemic<br>
administration such as oral, percutaneous, or parenteral administration; or topical<br>
administration such as via inhalation, a nose spray, eye drops or via a cream, gel,<br>
shampoo or the like. For example, in preparing the compositions in oral dosage form,<br>
any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water,<br>
glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as<br>
suspensions, syrups, elixirs and solutions: or solid carriers such as starches, sugars,<br>
kaolin, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders,<br>
pills, capsules and tablets. Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules<br>
represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which case solid pharmaceutical<br>
carriers are obviously employed. For parenteral compositions, the carrier will<br>
usually comprise sterile water, at least in large part, though other ingredients, for<br>
example, to aid solubility, may be included. Injectable solutions, for example, may be<br>
prepared in which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of<br>
saline and glucose solution. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in which case<br>
appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. In the<br>
compositions suitable for percutaneous administration, the carrier optionally comprises<br>
a penetration enhancing agent and/or a suitable wettable agent, optionally combined<br>
with suitable additives of any nature in minor proportions, which additives do not cause<br>
any significant deleterious effects on the skin. Said additives may facilitate the<br>
administration to the skin and/or may be helpful for preparing the desired compositions.<br>
These compositions may be administered in various ways, e.g., as a transdermal patch,<br>
as a spot-on or as an ointment. As appropriate compositions for topical application<br>
there may be cited all compositions usually employed for topically administering drugs<br>
e.g. creams, gellies, dressings, shampoos, tinctures, pastes, ointments, salves, powders<br>
and the like. Application of said compositions may be by aerosol, e.g. with a propellant<br>
such as nitrogen, carbon dioxide, a freon, or without a propellant such as a pump spray,<br>
drops, lotions, or a semisolid such as a thickened composition which can be applied by<br>
a swab. In particular, semisolid compositions such as salves, creams, gellies, ointments<br>
and the like will conveniently be used.<br>
It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical<br>
compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage.<br>
Dosage unit form as used in the specification and claims herein refers to physically<br>
discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity<br>
of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association<br>
with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such dosage unit forms are<br>
tablets (including scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills, powder packets, wafers,<br>
injectable solutions or suspensions, teaspoonfuls, tablespoonfuls and the like, and<br>
segregated multiples thereof.<br>
In order to enhance the solubility and/or the stability of the compounds of formula (I) in<br>
pharmaceutical compositions, it can be advantageous to employ a-, |3- or y-cyclodextrins<br>
or their derivatives. Also co-solvents such as alcohols may improve the<br>
solubility and/or the stability of the compounds of formula (I) in pharmaceutical<br>
compositions. In the preparation of aqueous compositions, addition salts of the subject<br>
compounds are obviously more suitable due to their increased water solubility.<br>

A. Preparation of the intermediates<br>
Example Al<br>
Preparation of I J~[ \ ( ] intermediate 1<br>
Thionyl chloride (0.5 ml) was added to a solution of bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-l,3,5-triene-7-<br>
carboxylic acid [14381-41-0] (0.001 mol) in dichloromethane. The reaction mixture<br>
was refluxed for 1 hour. Then stirred overnight at room temperature. The solvents<br>
were co-evaporated 2 times with benzene to obtain bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-l,3,5-triene-7-<br>
carbonyl chloride [1473-47-8] which was dissolved in DIPE. The obtained solution<br>
was added dropwise to a cooled mixture (0°C) of JV-allyl-2-adamantanamine [24161-<br>
63-5] and sodium carbonate in DIPE. The reaction mixture was stirred for 30 minutes<br>
on ice and then for 2 hours at room temperature. The mixture was poured out into<br>
water and extracted with dichloromethane. The organic layer was filtered through<br>
Extrelut™ and the filtrate was evaporated. The residue was purified by flash column<br>
chromatography on TRIKONEX FlashTube™ (eluent: CH2Cl2/EtOAc 90/10). The<br>
