				<td>This invention consists of a ring and traveller assembly for ring spinning machines. Both the ring and the traveller are magnetised. The traveller is movably disposed on the ring. The sides of the ring and the traveller facing each other have the same magnetic polarity. The magnetic repulsion of like poles establishes a clearance between the ring and the traveller. This avoids breaking of yarn and overcomes production drawbacks due to friction and heat generation.</td>

				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a ring and traveller assembly for ring spinning machines.<br>
In textile technology, ring spinning is a known step in yarn manufacturing. However, one of the inherent limitation of conventional ring spinning process is the speed of yarn production which is determined by the speed of the traveller in combination with that of the ring on which it moves decides the upper limit of yarn production. The surface pressure, offered by the traveller on the ring at high speeds, is one of the highest forces encounted in machine operation. Heat is generated at the points of contact between the ring and the traveller, due to the pressure, circular movement and friction. Temperatures measured with the help of emissivity meters show that at moderate speeds, ranges from 380oC to 400oC at the points of contacts. The ring as well as the surface of the traveller softens up at this temperature range resulting in siezure of materials. At this temperature the surface tends to etch or pock marked enhancing surface roughness and consequently the friction gets enhanced. As the traveller surface wears out at selected areas, the speed of the process slows down and in extreme cases the process gets stopped. Further, in the production of synthetic staple yarn, high temperature results in the fusion of protruding hair of the yarn to form beads; resulting in inferior quality yarn, with beady surface. Production of such inferior quality yarn is uneconimioal due to reduced market appeal.<br><br>
Normally, during yarn spinning at moderate speeds, the traveller races around the ring at a speed of 150 km per hour. The speed of the traveller and the friction formed during contact decide the upper limit to the yarn forming process.<br>
In textile industry rings are replaced every three or four years and travellers are replaced once in a week. Rough surfaces are encounted in new ring and traveller replacements. Therefore, when a new ring is fixed on to a machine, it goes through a running in" procedure extending up to 15 to 30 days during which period the machine runs at low speed producing inferior quality yarn. During the running in period a race track is established on the ring for the traveller and the traveller runs smoothly on this track. Till this smooth path is established, the fine yarn is pulled away by the traveller at irregular internals and the yarn tension varies and in many cases the yarn breaks. The production process is interrupted and the valuable process material is sucked into the pneumafil as a waste product to be recycled. This process break is teohnioally known as "end break". Since traveller replacement are frequent, end break levels are high and it takes time to settle down. Thus in the conventional ring traveller assembly the end beaks are very high in the beginning. Again, as the speed of operation increases, the centrifugal forces increases the traveller ring contact, the contact surface encounters high pressure, and consequent  high temperature  and  friction.   These parameters<br><br>
increase the yarn tension, and consequent yarn breaks. Bnd breaks are therefore high when the machine operates at high speed and at very high speed yearn spinning becomes impossible due to end breaks.<br>
The object of this invention is to develop a ring and traveller assembly which does not establish metal to metal contact during operation without sacrificing the spinning principles. Another object of this invention is to enhance ring spinning efficiency with increased speed of production.<br>
The ring and traveller assembly of this invention is based on the well known magnetic principle that like poles repel. The ring and the traveller are both made of a magnetic material noramely iron and are magnetised. The upper surface of the ring may either be south pole or the north pole of the magnet. The traveller is magnetised such that the traveller end which touches the ring has the same polarity as that of the surface of the ring. Inherent repelling action of the like poles of the ring and travleler surfaces, does not permit contact of these two surfaces. However, the centrifugal forces acting on the traveller due to the rotation of the bobbin, will force the traveller, to the surface of ring while at the same time, the repelling property of like poles tend to push traveller away from the ring surface. Thus the centrifugal force and the magnetic force will compensate each other at a short distance from the ring surface thereby allowing the traveller to rotate at a point slightly  away  from the ring surface,  thereby avoiding actual<br><br>
contact between the ring and the traveller, while in operation. Inevitable surface tension and consequent heat generation resulting from actual contact established between the ring and the traveller are avoided thereby increasing the life of the ring and the traveller as well as the speed of the spinning process resulting in higher production rate.<br>
In the ring and traveller assembly according to this Invention, the surfaces do not touch each other and therefore friction is minimised. This successfully eliminates the "running in time" and also theoritically removes the upper speed limit. The physical properties of the spinning material namely cotton or synthetics alone decide the upper speed limit. Since actual contact is avoided, heat generation is eliminated avoiding bead formation while processing synthetic. Wear and tear of the ring traveller is minimised thereby enhancing their active service life.<br>
Accordingly the invention provides a ring and traveller assembly for ring spinning machines comprising magnetised ring and traveller units, said traveller being movably disposed on said ring, the surfaces of said ring and traveller Juxtaposed each other having the same magnetic polarity thereby establishing a clearance there between due to magnetic repulsion of like poles.<br><br>
In a specific embodiment, the ring may be made of plastic naterial having nagnetically active netal Incorporated therein. These magnetics nay be single nagnet or a plurality of nagnet.<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to Figure I of the aoooapanying drawings which shows the yearn forning set up of a ring and traveller assembly. Reference letter T shows the traveller while letter R stands for the ring. Y Indicates the yarn and B shows the bobbin on which the yearn is wound. C shows the snail clearing established between the ring and the traveller due to nagnetic repulsion of the like poles of the ring or the traveller facing each other.<br>
Though this invention has been described hereinabove with reference to a specific enbodinent, alterations and nodifioations known to persons skilled in the art are not beyond the scope of the appended olains.<br><br><br>
