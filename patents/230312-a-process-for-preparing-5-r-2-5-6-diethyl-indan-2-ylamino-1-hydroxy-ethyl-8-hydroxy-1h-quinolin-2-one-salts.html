5-[{R)-2-(5,6-diethyI-indan'2ylamino}-l-hydroxy-ethy]]-8-hydroxy-(?/f)-quinolinone-2-one salts are p-selective adrenoceptor agonists with potent bronchodilator activity. For example, 5-I(R)-2-|5,6-diethyl-indan-2-ylamino)-l-hydroxy-ethyl]-8-hydroxy-{IH)-quinolinone-2-one maleate is especially useful for treating asthma and COPD. In addition, the maleate salt has been shown to have a very long duration of action in vitro and in vivo.<br>
In a process for preparing 5-JfR)-2-(5,6-diethyl-indan-2-ylamino)-l-hydroxy-ethylJ-8-hydroxy-(f H)-quinoIinone-2-one maleate, an epoxide, such as 8-substitutcd oxy-5-(R(-oxiranyl-(lH)-quinolin-2-one (Formula (I)], is reacted with an amine, such as 2-amino-(5-6-diethyl)-indan, to form a desired intermediate 5-((R)-2-(5,6-diethyl-indan-2-ylamino)-l-hydroxy-ethyl]-8-substituted oxy-(lH)-quinolin-2-one {Formula (II)]. However, the reaction is not regjoselective and delivers various amounts of a regioisomer (Formula (III)] and a<br><br>
Generally, the reaction mixture above contains only about 60% to 80% of the desired intermediate having Formula (II). In addition, it is difficult to purify the intermediate having Formula (H) by crystallization without a high loss of yield.  For example, silica gel chromatography has been used for such a purification, however, scale-up of silica gel chromatography is tedious and requires large volumes of solvents.<br><br>
It would be desirable to develop a more efficient process for preparing 5-[{R)-2-(5,6-dtethyl indan-2-ylamino)-l-hydroxy-ethyl]-8-hydroxy-(2H)-quino)inone-2-one salts especially for large scale production, which provides the salts in high enantiomeric purity and high yield.<br>

The invention is illustrated by the following Examples.<br><br><br><br>
AIL hydrogenation vessel was charged with 40 grams of 8-phenylmethloxy-5-((R)-2-(5,6-diethyNindan-2-ylamino}-l-hydroxy-ethyI]-?tf-quinofin-2-one benzoate and 400 mL of acetic acid. Palladium on charcoal 5% (5.44 g) was added and the reaction mass was hydrogenated for 2-8 hours until complete conversion to 5-[{R}-2-(5,6-diethyI-indan-2-yIamino)-l-hydroxy-erhyl]-8-hydroxy-3//-quinoJin-2-one. The mixture was filtered over a pad of filter-aid. The filtrate was concentrated at 50-60 Â°C under vacuum (100 mbar) to a volume of 70-90 mL. This residue was dissolved in 400 mL of ethanol and heated to 50-60 Â°C. A solution of 11.6 g maleic acid in 24 mL ethanol was added and the resulting clear solution was seeded at an internal temperature of 50 Â°C with a suspension of 350 mg micronised 5-[(R)-2-(5,6-diethyl-indan-2-ylamino)-l-hydroxy-ethyl]-8-hydroxy-IH-quinolin-2-one in 20 mL isopropanol. The product was crystallized by slow cooling to 0-5 Â°C.<br>
Filtration and washing with 50 mL of ethanol followed by 25 mL of isopropanol provided 65 g crude 5-[(R)-2-(5,6-diethyl-indan-2-ylamino)-l-hydroxy-ethyI]-8-hydroxy-IH-quinolin-2-one maleate which was further purified by crystallization from 1.36 L of ethanol. This gave 24.3 g pure 5-[(R)-2-(5,6-diethyi-indan-2-y!amino)-l-hydroxy-ethyI]-8-hydroxy-lW-quinolin-2-one maleate as a white crystalline powder.<br>
Example 3<br>
Purity and Yield of Different Salts of 5-(fR)-2-f5.6-diethyl-indan-2-ylamjno)-l-h.ydroxy-ethyl]-8-substituted oxy-(JH)-quinoiin-2-one<br>
A 1 L, 4-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer, addition funnel and refluxing condenser was charged with 30.89 grams of 2-amino-5,6-diethylindan and diethylene glycol dimethyl ether. To this solurion was added 36.4 grams of 8-phenylmerhoxy-5-(R)-oxiranyl-ZH-quinolin-2-one. The resulting suspension was heated to a temperature of 110 Â°C and stirred at this temperature for 15 hours. The resulting brown solution was cooled to 70 Â°C.<br><br><br>
Thus, it has surprisingly been found that (a) the yield of 5-|(R)-2-(5,6-diethyl-indari-2-ylamino)-l-hydroxy-ethyl]-8-hydroxy-(IH)-quinolin-2-one salt may be significantly increased<br><br>
by forming an acid salt of 5-[(R)-2-(5)6-diethyl-indan-2-y]an]ino)-l-h)'droxy-ethyl]-8-substituted oxy-(lH)-quinolin-2-one; and (b) the acid salt can be converted to a salt of 5-[(R)-2-(5,6-diethyl-indan-2-ylamino)-l-hydroxy-ethyl]-8-hydroxy-{IH}-quinolin-2-one without isolating the free base oi 5-[(R)-2-(5,6-diethyl-indan-2-y]amino)-l-hydroxy-erhyl]-8-hydroxy-(IH)-quinolin-2-one.<br><br>
A dry 3 L, 4-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer, addition funnel and refluxing condenser is charged with 50 g 8-(pheny!methoxy)-5-{a-chloroacetyl)-(lH)-quinolin-2-one and 600 mL dry THF under N2. Then 15 mL of a 1 molar solution of (Rj-tetrahydro-l-methyl-S^-diphenyl-tlHJWJ-pyrrololl^-cHl^^l-oxazaborole in toluene was added. The mixture was cooled to an internal temperature of 0-2 Â°C and while maintaining an internal temperature of 0-2 Â°C, 153 mL of a 1 moJar solution of BHj in THF was added over 1-2 hours. The reaction was stirred for another hour at an internal temperature of 0-2 Â°C and then quenched by addition of 65 mL methanol. The resulting solution was warmed to 25 "C and concentrated to a volume of 250 mL (50 Â°C / 200 mbar). To this concentrate was added a mixture of 713 mL water and 37 g HC1 37%. During the addition 8-(phenylmethoxy)-5-((R)-2-chloro-l-hydroxy-ethyl)-(IH)-quinolin-2-one precipitated as a nearly colourless precipitation. The resulting suspension was stirred for 30 minutes at 25 Â°C, filtrated and washed with 220 mL water in several portions. Drying in a vacuum drier at 50 Â°C for 12 hours resulted in 47.41 g of 8-(phenylmethoxy)-5-{(R)-2-chloro-l-hydroxy-ethyl}-(2H)-quinolin-2-one as a slightly yellowish powder.<br><br><br>
A 3 L, 4-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer, addition funnel and refluxing condenser was charged with 50 g 8-(phenylmethoxy)-5-((R)-2-chloro-l-hydroxy-ethy\)-(lH)-qumo\m-2-one, 52.42 g potassium carbonate, 2500 mL acetone and 25 mL warer. The mixture was heated under stirring to reflux. Refluxing was maintained for 5-10 hours until an in process control showed complete conversion of 8-phenylmethoxy-5-((/?)-2-chioro-l-hydroxy-ethyl)-(IH)-quinoiUv2-one to 8-phenylmethoxy-5-(R)-oxiranyl-(ZH)-quinolin-2-one. When the reaction was completed, the hot {45-50 C) reaction mixture was filtered to remove the inorganic salts. The residue was washed with several portions of acetone, and the combined mother liquor and acetone washings were concentrated to a volume of 450 mL To the resulting suspension was added 235 mL heptanes at 25 "C and then the suspension was cooled to an internal temperature of 0-2 Â°C and stirred at this temperature for 2-3 hours. Filtration and washing resulted in a crude 8-pheny!methoxy-5-(J!)-oxiranyl-(Z/f)-quinolin-2-one which was re-crystallized from toluene. This resulted in 36.7 g 8-(phenylmethoxy)-5-(i?)-oxiranyl-(JH)-quinolin-2-one as nearly colourless solid.<br><br><br>
