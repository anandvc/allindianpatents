TITLE OF INVENTION<br>
"STRENGTH ENHANCING INSERT ASSEMBLIES"<br>
(a) INDIAN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY Bombay (b) having administrative office at Powai, Mumbai 400076, State of Maharashtra, India and (c) an autonomous educational Institute, and established in India under the Institutes of Technology Act 1961.<br><br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
19-10-2005<br><br><br><br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to insert assemblies of high specific strength to reduce stress concentrations at locations where multidirectional stresses act on sandwich structures designed based on mapping stress distribution and failure initiation.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Light weight sandwich structures are used in structural applications such as vehicles, aerospace industry, framework etc. because of their superior strength and stiffness properties along through-the-thickness direction under bending loads. The use of inserts is essential to strengthen the sandwich structures to withstand localized loads. Further, when the external members or sub-structures are attached to sandwich structures, inserts become a necessity.<br>
Sandwich structures are made of a three layer type of construction consisting of two thin sheets of higher stiffness and strength material between which a thick layer of lower strength and density is sandwiched. The two thin sheets on either side are called the face-plates, and the intermediate layer the core. The faceÂ¬plates resist the in-plane and bending loads. These are generally made of aluminum or polymer matrix composites. The core of a sandwich structure is generally made of foam or honeycomb. Sandwich structures are characterized by very high flexural stiffness-to-weight ratio. For a given set of mechanical loads, sandwich structures often result in a lower structural weight than do other configurations [Plantema, F. J. 1966. Sandwich Construction, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York;.Vinson, J. R. 1999. The Behavior of Sandwich Structures of Isotropic and Composite Materials, Technomic Publishing Co., Inc., Lancaster]."<br>
2<br><br>
The specific strength of an insert assembly is a ratio of load at failure initiation to weight of the insert assembly, which should be as high as possible to achieve effective utilization of sandwich structures with inserts. In practice, these inserts are made of aluminum alloys, other metals/alloys etc. High density of metals/alloys increases the weight of insert assembly resulting in undesirable reduction in the specific strength. Further, the difference in material properties at the interface between the insert and the potting material such as resin leads to high stress concentration at the interfaces between insert and potting material and between potting material and core.<br>
For structural members having a constant cross-section or a section with gradual change of contours, stress distribution is generally obtained using the elementary formulae. For such cases, stress distribution follows a regular trend. But, actual structural members are complex in nature, sometimes consist of two or more materials. For such cases, localized high stresses occur generally at the location of material discontinuities or geometrical discontinuities. This localization of high stresses is known as stress concentration [Peterson, R. E. 1974. Stress Concentration Factors, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York; Naik, N. K. and Rajaiah, K. 1984. Minimum stress concentration factor for two neighbouring holes in disks by photoelasticity, ASCE Journal of Engineering Mechanics, Vol. 110, pp. 654-659].<br>
US Patent 5240543 discloses a basic procedure to seat a fastener insert in a honeycomb panel. A fastener insert made of alloy attached to a mounting fixture is inserted into a hole drilled in a honeycomb panel. The mounting fixture has a rod with a disc at an end descending from a base and a chimney ascending from the base. Two bores are located in the base and are enclosed by the chimney. The mounting fixture base overlaps the head of the fastener insert which has two bores in the head. The bores in the fastener insert head are aligned with bores in the base of the mounting fixture. Epoxy is inserted into one of the bores in the base of the mounting fixture continuously until it returns out of the second bore.<br>
3<br><br>
The epoxy is allowed to cure and thereafter the mounting fixture is removed by a turning motion. Though this patent describes the method of installation of inserts into honeycomb sandwich structures, it does not address the issue of minimization of the insert assembly weight and a means to increase specific strength.<br>
US Patent 5082405 and US 4941785 disclose the geometry of the inserts and the method to attach the insert to the attachment. In this insert assembly, epoxy resin is used as potting compound. The insert is a metallic member, made of stainless steel, aluminum alloy, and carbon steel. However, metal insert increases weight of the insert assembly resulting in reduction of specific strength.<br>
US Patent 5053285 discloses the method and apparatus for making corrugated aluminum inserts. These inserts are made from aluminum foil strips by passing the strips through the corrugating device. Though the weight of such inserts is less, stresses at the interfaces of different materials increase because the elastic properties of corrugated aluminum inserts are less resulting in higher stress concentrations.<br>
US Patent 6055790 discloses construction of an insert wherein the conduction and radiation are improved through the inserts. To improve the heat transfer rate, one of the face-plates is made of metal sheet. The insert material is aluminum alloy. In this arrangement, a higher thermally conducting path is provided from one side of the insert assembly to the other side. However, these inserts suffer from the deficiency such that the surrounding potting material made of resin which is not a good conductor of heat that leads to thermal gradient along the radial direction. This causes higher thermal stresses in the sandwich structure. The use of metal for face-plate increases weight of insert assembly thereby decreasing the specific strength.<br>
4<br><br>
US Patent 3271498 discloses an improved method of installation of inserts. However it does not address the issue of weight of an insert assembly.<br>
A method of fabricating a honeycomb core structure with embedded fastener is disclosed in US Patent 4716067. The bonding material is epoxy resin. The method comprises laying down a first nonmetallic synthetic layer, which may be cured or uncured. Bonded to the first nonmetallic synthetic layer is a honeycomb core layer into which one or more flush head fasteners are inserted into holes in the honeycomb core that have an indentation at one end configured to mate with the underside of the head of a flush head fastener. Bonding is accomplished by priming the walls of the honeycomb core layer adjacent the surfaces of the layer, and the fastener, with a suitable primer, preferably before the fastener is installed, and, coating one of the surfaces of the first nonmetallic synthetic layer with a suitable adhesive before joining the first nonmetallic synthetic layer to the surface of the honeycomb core layer containing the head of the flush head fastener. Thereafter, the cells of the honeycomb core that surround the fastener are filled with a potting material. Then, a second nonmetallic synthetic layer is bonded to the surface of the honeycomb core remote from the surface to which the first nonmetallic synthetic layer is bonded. There are several drawbacks of this method and insert assembly. The fasteners are made of an alloy. The density of the alloys used is more compared to the composites. Significantly high interfacial stresses develop between the alloy insert and the potting resin material. Further, this patent describes the method of installation of inserts into honeycomb sandwich structures. It does not address the issue of enhancing the specific strength of insert assemblies.<br>
The shortcomings in prior art vis-a vis use of inserts in sandwich structure are<br>
â¢	Use of metal for inserts which leads to decrease in specific strength of the insert assembly.<br>
â¢	Though geometry of the inserts and different methods of installation of these  inserts  into  sandwich  structures  is  addressed,  the  issue  of<br>
5<br><br>
minimization of the insert assembly weight and a means to increase specific strength of insert assembly has not been addressed.<br>
â¢	" There are  no  methods  of reliably mapping  stress distribution  and<br>
prediction   of  failure   initiation   in   sandwich   structures  with   diverse ! geometrical configurations.<br>

Insert materials<br>
The insert materials are selected from<br>
I)	2D woven composites<br>
II)	3D woven composites<br>
III)	3D thermoelastic isotropic woven composites<br>
IV)	3D functionally gradient woven composites<br>
V)	3D woven composite with multiple inserts<br>
I) 2D composites<br>
2D composites are those in which only in-plane reinforcements are provided. In laminated composites made of unidirectional layers, different layers are oriented accordingly to achieve required elastic and strength properties. In woven fabric composites, reinforcements are provided along mutually perpendicular directions in the same layer by the process of weaving. Weaving is the process in which the woven fabric is formed by interlacing warp and fills (weft) yarns in regular<br>
11<br><br>
sequence of under and over. Based on the sequence of placing the yarns under and over, the woven fabrics are classified into plain, twill and satin. Specifically, one under and one over sequence is the plain weave.<br>
II)	3D woven composites<br>
3D woven performs are fully integrated continuous fiber assembly having multiaxial in-plane and out of plane fiber orientations. In such preforms, reinforcement is also provided in through-the-thickness direction in addition to planar directions. These preforms are made using the process of 3D weaving. Based on the weave pattern, the preforms can be orthogonal interlock woven or angle interlock woven. Further, it can be classified into through-the-thickness woven and layer to layer woven. Using the 3D preforms and resin transfer molding, 3D composites are made. 3D composites are 3D orthotropic and macrospecically homogeneous materials. Such materials are characterized by 9 elastic properties and 9 strength properties.<br>
III)	3D thermoelastic isotropic woven composites<br>
These are a class of 3D composites with special characteristics. For such materials, elastic and thermal properties are the same along all the directions. In other words, such composites are thermoelastically isotropic.<br>
IV)	3D functionally gradient woven composites<br>
3D functionally gradient woven composites are the ideal materials for making inserts. In a typical insert assembly with single insert material, there is a significant difference in material elastic properties between insert and potting material and potting material and core. Through-the-thickness elastic properties of insert, potting material and core are of the order of 40 GPa, 2.5 GPa and 0.31 GPa respectively. This leads to higher stress concentrations at the interfaces between attachment and insert, insert and potting material, potting material and core. An ideal way of reducing the stress concentrations and increasing the specific strength is to use a material system for inserts with gradually varying elastic and strength properties along the radial direction. Such a material is called<br>
12<br><br>
functionally gradient. A composite insert made of functionally gradient material has through-the-thickness elastic properties nearly matching with that of the attachment along the inner circumference and through-the-thickness elastic properties matching with that of potting material along the outer circumference. Consequently, elastic properties of the insert with such a configuration would be higher along the inner circumference and lower along the outer circumference and varying radially in a functionally gradient way. For such insert materials, the stress concentrations at the interfaces would be minimum leading to higher specific strength.<br>
V) 3D woven composites with multiple inserts<br>
Inserts made of 3D woven composite with multiple inserts is a class of inserts made of 3D functionally gradient woven composite. In this insert, the elastic and strength properties are not varied gradually along the radius from the inner circumference to the outer circumference. Instead, the elastic and strength properties are varied in a stepped manner. This amounts to using multiple inserts instead of a single insert. If the material properties are varied in three steps, there would be three different 3D woven composites. These three different 3D woven composites are referred as material 1, material 2 and material 3.<br>
The materials and geometry of the insert assembly is decided by mapping stress distribution for obtaining failure conditions by the following process:<br>
A method is described to map stress distribution in sandwich structures with inserts under localized through-the-thickness tensile / compressive loading. The core is relatively thick and compressible whereas the face-plates are relatively thin. The core is analyzed using higher-order sandwich plate theory whereas the face-plates are analyzed using classical plate theory. The behavior of the sandwich structure is represented using a set of 24 governing differential equations. For the geometry of the insert assembly and the loading conditions<br>
13<br><br><br>
In the above method the stress distribution is mapped and failure initiation is obtained in steps comprising<br>
â¦	Establishing frame of reference for sandwich structures with inserts<br>
â¦	Applying equilibrium equations, continuity conditions and constitutive relations of the core and the face-plates to obtain 24th order partial differential equation consisting of fundamental variables such as<br>
Mid-plane radial displacement of upper and lower face-plates in radial direction,<br>
Mid-plane circumferential displacement of upper and lower faceÂ¬plates in circumferential direction,<br>
Transverse displacement of upper and lower face-plates,<br>
Derivative of transverse displacement with respect to radius of insert assembly of upper and lower face-plates,<br>
Derivative of transverse displacement with respect to circumferential direction of upper and lower face-plates and divided by radius of insert assembly,<br>
Bending moment resultant of upper and lower face-plates in radial direction,<br>
Twisting moment resultant in the plane of radial and circumferential coordinates of upper and lower face-plates,<br>
16<br><br><br>
All the Cjj are stiffness constants and are calculated using elastic properties of the material.<br>
The normal and shear stress distribution within the entire insert assembly can be obtained using this novel method. The induced stress state can lead to initiation of failure within insert assembly. Initiation of failure is characterized using the following through-the-thickness quadratic interaction failure criterion.<br><br><br>
(5)<br><br>
Here,<br><br>
15<br><br>
considered the boundary conditions are specified. In this case, there are 24 boundary conditions. Using the differential equations and the set of 24 boundary conditions, the deformation behavior and stress state within the insert assembly are calculated. Specifically, the following quantities are determined: transverse displacement of top and bottom face-plates (w1 and w2), transverse shear stress<br>
{Trz),   mid-plane   radial   displacement   of   top   face-plate   (ul0l),   mid-plane<br>
circumferential displacement of top face-plate (vl0l). The novel method to reliably<br>
map stress distribution is described in the form of flow diagrams in Figures 4 and 5.<br>
The input parameters are: geometry of the insert assembly, elastic properties of different materials used for making the insert assembly and the loading condition. This novel method enables to map the following parameters reliably:<br>
â¢	transverse and radial displacements of the insert assembly<br>
â¢	normal and shear stress components throughout the insert assembly<br>
Equations used for mapping stress distribution for obtaining failure conditions are:<br>
The transverse displacement of the core material,<br><br><br><br><br>
(2)<br><br>
Radial displacement in the core material,<br>
14<br><br>
In-plane normal stress resultant in radial direction of upper and lower face-plates,<br>
In-plane normal stress resultant in the plane of radial and circumferential coordinates of upper and lower face-plates,<br>
In-plane shear stress resultant in the plane of radial and circumferential coordinates of upper and lower face-plates,<br>
Transverse shear stress component of core in the plane of radial and circumferential coordinates,<br>
Shear stress in circumferential direction on a plane perpendicular to through-the-thickness direction in the core,<br>
Derivative of shear stress in circumferential direction on a plane perpendicular to through-the-thickness direction in the core with respect to radius of the insert assembly,<br>
Derivative of transverse shear stress component of core in the plane of radial and circumferential coordinates with respect to radius of the insert assembly,<br>
and further to obtain 24 first order coupled exact differential equations<br>

Example 1<br>
Experimental studies<br>
â¦   Fabrication of Through-the-Thickness Insert Assembly<br>
The insert assembly comprises of six constituents. They are: insert, potting material, foam core, lower face-plate, upper face-plate and the attachment. Lower face-plate and the upper face-plate are made of woven fabric E glass and epoxy resin using matched-die molding technique. The core is made of polyurethane foam. The attachment is made of mild steel. The material used for composite inserts is glass. The potting material is epoxy resin. Three insert assemblies were constructed using the above with aluminum, 2D woven composite and 3D woven composite as insert materials.<br>
â¢	Measurement of load, displacements and failure initiation<br>
â¢	The insert assembly was placed on a support ring and then located on Hounsfield Test Equipment-450 KS, 50 KN UTM.<br>
â¢	Compressive load was applied through the attachment on to the insert assembly.<br>
â¢	The displacement of the attachment, lower face-plate, upper face-plate and the corresponding load were measured at loading rate of 0.25 mm/min.<br>
â¢	Failure initiation of the insert assembly is obtained from sudden change in the load-displacement plot.<br>
20<br><br>
Experimental Results<br>
Transverse displacement as a function of compressive load for through-the-thickness inserts is presented in Figures 6-8. For the same geometrical configurations and material properties (Tables 1 and 2), analytically obtained transverse displacement plots, compressive load at failure initiation and specific strength of inserts are presented in Figures 6-8 and Tables 3 and 4. The compressive loading was applied until the failure initiation took place.<br>
Failure functions (equation 5) are plotted as a function of compressive load in Figure 9. It is observed from Tables 3 and 4 that the compressive load at failure is higher for the case of 3D woven composite compared to the aluminum as insert material. The specific strength of insert is significantly higher for the case of 3D woven composite compared to the aluminum insert case. For the case of 2D woven composite insert, it is in between aluminum and 3D woven composite.<br>

Comparison of through-the-thickness inserts of present invention with inserts of prior art<br>
Using the method of the present invention, compressive load at failure initiation, failure function and specific strength of inserts are mapped for the prior art disclosed in US Patent 50532285 (corrugated aluminum insert) and for the insert (3D woven composite insert) of the present invention with the same geometry as used for the prior art (R = 30 mm). The results are given in Figure 10 and Table 5. Further, the geometry of the insert of the present invention was modified (R = 10 mm) to reduce the insert assembly weight. With such a modified configuration, compressive load at failure initiation, failure function and specific strength of inserts are mapped. From Figure 10 and Table 5, it is established that the inserts of the present invention are having higher specific strength compared to the insert of prior art.<br>
