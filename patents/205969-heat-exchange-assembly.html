HEAT EXCHANGE ASSEMBLY<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a heat exchange assembly, and more particularly to a plate heat exchange assembly which may be optionally utilized as a liquid-to-gas heat exchanger, a low-flow internally-cooled liquid-desiccant absorber, a liquid-desiccant regenerator or an evaporatively-cooled fluid cooler.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Heating, venSaSnc, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems regulate ambient conditions within buflcTmgs lor comfort. Such systems provide control of the indoor environment in a given space to create and maintain desirable temperature, hurradty, and ar circulation, for the occupants. One important component found in such syssms is a heat exchanger whkri 's a device used for transferring heat from one medkirn tc another without allowing the media to mix.<br>
One type of heat exchanger comprises a plurality of plates arranged in a spaced apart relationship by spacers. The space between adjacent plates provides a flow path for a heat transfer fluid. Each of the plates comprises a double walled board of metal or plastic, the walls being spaced-apart by partitions that form a plurality of interna]<br><br>
passages therein. The partitions defining the internal passages provide a fluid flow path for a second heat transfer fluid. Examples of the use of such heat exchangers and details of their construction and operation are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,638,900 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,079,481, each of which is incorporated herein fay reference.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,469,915 discloses a heat exchanger comprising a plurality of plates (also referred as "panels) arranged in a spaced apart manner.   Each plate comprises a plurality of open-ended tubular members oriented in a planar arrangement sandwiched between a pair of thin, plastic films laminated thereon.  A manifold is mounted to each open end of the pistes, A nest transfer fluid is supplied to the plates from one manifold and exits the pistes through the other manifold. In one embodiment, each manifold has multiple orifices into which the ends of the plate's tubes are inserted and sealed. In another embodiment, each manifold is composed of two pieces, each piece with semicircular recesses that ni&amp;kzi the contour of the tubes. The ends of the plate's tubes are clamped between the two halves of the manifold so that the ends of the plate's tubes are compJetefy cavaned wshin ihe manifoki and the manifold and plate form a leak-tight assembly.   For esher embodiment of the manifold, a heat exchanger assembly composed of two cr mere pistes can be made by stacking and joining together the manifolds.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,898,153 discloses a solar heat exchanger constructed from a double-walled plate with multiple internal flow passages. It is further disclosed that the ends of the plate are coupled to end components which provide recesses for turning a<br><br>
fluid flowing through the plates 180° and outlet and inlet fittings are attached to the end components.<br>
In an HVAC system, a dehumidifier may be used to extract moisture from the process air to yield relatively dry air. The air to be processed is usually dehumidified by cooling and/or by dehydration. In a dehydration process, air is usually passed through a device referred to as an absorber which typically includes chambers containing an absorptive material such as, for example, silica gel or calcium chloride. One type of absorber referred to herein as a tiquid-desiccant absorber, utilizes a liquid desiccant, or drying agent, to remove water vapor from the air being processed. An example of a iiquid-desiccant absorber and further details of its operation are disclosed in U.S. Pat No. 5,351,497, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Liquid-desiccant absorbers typically include a porous bed of a contact medium saturated with a liquid desiccant As the desiccantfiows and permeates throughout the bed, it comes into contact with the wster-ccnssinmg air flowing therethrough. The desiccant which by definition, has a strong affinay for water vapor, absorbs or extracts the moisture from ihe process air.<br>
During the dehumidrfication process, heat is generally released as the water vapor condenses and mixes with the desiccant The total amount of heat generated usually equals the latent heat of condensation for water plus the heat generated by mixing the desiccant and water. In a typical absorber, the heat of mixing wfli be about<br><br>
an order of magnitude smaller than the latent heat of condensation. The heat released during dehumid'rfication raises the temperature of the air and desiccant. The air exits the absorber with approximately the same enthalpy as when it entered. For example, air enters the absorber at 80°F, 50% relative humidity (31.3 BTU/Ib enthalpy) and leaves at 97 °F, 20% relative humidity (31.5 BTU/Ib enthalpy). In this configuration, the absorber functions strictly as a dehumidifier.<br>
The absorber may be incorporated into an air-cooling system. By coofing the desiccant and the process air through a heat exchanger utilizing a coolant or refrigerant, the process air exiis the absorber at a lower enthalpy and relative humidity Sen when it entered, thus generating a desirable net cooling effect Absorbers utffizffw such coolant assemblies often exhibit increased dehumidification capacity and efaciency over those that do not However, prior art internally-cooled absorbers are types-fly mere clficuft and expensive to fabricate. In addition, such absorbers often experience difficulties in keeping tie respective heat exchanging fluid streams and fiquki desiccant separate and apart cue in persistent leakage problems.<br>
It would therefore be a significant advance in the art of heat exchangers to provide a heat exchange assembly which can effectively maintain the respective heat transfer fluids or media separate from one another and which can be constructed effectively from corrosion-resistant materials in a configuration that may be utilized in a wide variety of heat transfer systems, including, but not limited to, liquid-to-gas heat<br><br>
exchangers, internally-cooled liquid-desiccant absorbers, and evaporativefy-cooled fluid coolers.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invgnfirm<br>
Tne present invention is generally directed to a best exchange assembly constructed in a manner for efficiently and effecSveiv transTorrinc thermaJ enerov between an isolated first fluid flowing through a pluraiity of spaced apart plates via a fluid manifold coupled at each end of the pluraiity of plates, and second and/or third fluids passing through the space between adjacent pfe«    Tne heat exchange assemciy is constructed from a light-weight material and acansd to orcvide reliable and efficient heat transfer. Optionally, the heat exchange assembly may be configured to operate as an internally-cooled liquid-desiccant absorber for regulating the water content of a fluid flowing over the surface of the liquid desiccant, a liquid-desiccant regenerator adapted for expelling moisture in the liquid desiccant to an air stream passing over the surface of the liquid desiccant, or an evaporatr/eJy-cooted fluid cooler for removing heat from the fluid flowing internally within the ptetes.<br><br>
In contrast to the heat exchangers that are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,469,915, the ends of the plates do not have to be inserted into openings in the manifolds, yet there is still only one manifold piece attached to each end of the plate. In contrast to the solar heat exchanger described in U.S. Pat No 4,898,153, the manifold pieces also function as spacers that provide the desired gap between plates.<br>
The heat exchange assembly provides generally for a heat transfer fluid flowing through a plurality of plates, each plate having first and second ends, and one or more internal passages extending between the first and second ends. An end-piece member is fiuidiy coupled to each end of the plate for directing fluid flow within the passages of the piste. The pistes isolste the heat transfer fluid from the external fluid medium, write maintaining a hesi exchange relationship therebetween. The plate forming the passages ihereai are preferably made from profile board or similar materials, corrugated bcsrd, tube sheets, stamped sheets, thermoformed sheets, and the like, each cf which can be easily constructed from rigid corrosion-resistant materials such " as plssoc polymer material, corrosion-resistant metal, and the ffte.<br>
As used herein, the term "profile board" shall mean an assembly constructed as a double wailed sheet, wherein the walls are separated by a series of ribs or webs, preferably uniformly spaced, along the full length of the sheet The ribs define the plurality of passages referred to herein. An example of the construction of a profile board is disclosed in U.S. Pat No. 4,898,153, the content of which is incorporated<br><br>
herein by reference.<br>
As used herein, the term "corrugated board" shall mean an assembly generally comprising three thin plates, two of which are essentially flat and form the outer surfaces of the board, and a third plate which is not flat. The third plate is typically folded, molded, stamped or otherwise formed so that when it is inserted between the first two plates, it maintains the outer plates parallel to each other while forming flow passages therebetween that run the length of the board. The three thin plates can be glued, bonded, welded, fastened or fused together at their points of contact to form a more rigid structure.<br>
As used herein the term "tube sheef shsii mean an assembly constructed from multiple open-ended tuodar members, each with a circular cross section, that are joined along their length te form a substantially pfenar structure.<br>
Referring to the drawings and partksrisriytD Fcure 1, a heat exchange assembly 10 of the present invention is shown. The heat exchange assembly 10 comprises generally a top fluid manifold 12, a bottom Suid manifold 14, a plurality of hollow, rectilinear plates 16 arranged in a parallel, spaced-apart relationship, and a pair of side panels 18 for enclosing the ends thereof. The top fluid manifold 12 is composed of a plurality of top end-piece members 26 with adjacent members juxtaposed in abutting engagement The bottom fluid manifold 14 is composed of a plurality of bottom end-piece members 28 arranged in a similar manner as described above for the top end-<br><br>
piece members 26. Each individual plate 16 is coupled to the top end-piece member 26 at one end 44 and the bottom end-piece member 28 at the other end 50 to form a plate and end-piece member component In this configuration, each of the plate and end-piece member components is disposed in a stacked arrangement and securely affixed to one another. Each end-piece member 28 includes throughholes which forms the corresponding fluid-tight conduits and reservoirs'. The components of the assembly 10 may be affixed by means including, but not limited to, gluing, welding, brazing, bonding, fusing, fastening, clamping, and the like to construct the heat exchange. assembly 10. The assembly 10 further includes an intet fitting 22 and an outlet fitting 24 fiuidly coupled to the top fluid manifold 12,<br>
The assembly 10 is adapted to receive ar, iniemai heat transfer fluid through the inlet fitting 22. The heat transfer fluid circulates through the assembly 10 whereby a heat exchange operation is carried out as wfil be described in detail hereinafter. In combination, the top and bottom fluid manifolds 12 and 14 and plates 16 are adapted to maintain a continuous flow path for the internal hestUais&amp;fa fluid trave&amp;ig through the assembly 10. The circulated internal heat trsnssr Suid is then discharged from the assembly 10 through the outlet fitting 24. it is noted that the assembly 10 may be modified to provide multiple inlet and/or outlet fittings and to provide such inlet or outlet fitting at other locations as desired.<br>
The spaced-apart plates 16 define a plurality of spacings 20 adapted to permit the stationary presence or passage therethrough of a external solid or fluid medium.<br><br>
In the latter, a fluid medium passes through the spacings 20 of the assembly 10 at one end and exit out at the opposite end. The spacings 20 between the adjacent plates 16 are preferably uniform and equally spaced apart, while being relatively close together for facilitating an efficient and compact heat exchange operation. The plates 16 of the assembly 10 are generally arranged in a vertical orientation. However, it is understood that the plates 16 may also be arranged in other suitable orientations depending on the application or requirements.<br>
Tne internal heat transfer fluid flowing in the passages may be In the form of a fend or a gas. The external medium may be in the form of a soBd, a liquid or a gas. Per example, a solid may be an apparatus that is capable of exchanging heat wilfc the internal heat transfer fluid. The present heat exchange assembly may be used in, for example, ice storage systems, evaporative fluid coolers, liquid desiccant absorbers, Squid desiccant regenerators, vapor condensers, liquid boilers, Squid-to-gas heat exchangers, or any applications where the transfer of heat between discrete mediums<br>
Referring to Figures 2 and 3, the top fluid manifold 12 and hcttcm fluid manifold 14 are each configured, in combination, to securely retain the plurality of plates 16 in a spaced-apart relationship, facilitate fluid flow into and out of the plurality of plates 16 and establish a fluid flow path (e.g. a serpentine-line fluid flow path) within each plate 16 as will be described in detail hereinafter. In particular, the mangolds 12 and 14 comprise structural features aligned with each of the plates 16 to facState the desired<br><br>
flow of the fluids within and around the plates 16. The fluid flow path (e.g. serpentine-like fluid flow path) permits the internal heat transfer fluid to pass through a corresponding plate 16 a multiple number of times, thereby maximizing the heat exchange operation between the associated mediums. The side panels 18 are each affixed to the end of the assembly 10 for sealing or enclosing the internal heat transfer fluid in the respective internal volumes, and for providing the assembly 10 with structural strength and rigidity.<br>
The top fluid manifold 12 includes an end wall 30 and a pair of side walls 32 extending longitudinally alone the edge of the end wall 30. The top fluid manifold 12 when in operative position securing a plurality of plates 16 together defines an inlet conduit 34, and an outlet conduit 36, each extending internally along the length thereof. The inlet conduit 34 is in fluid cornrnunication with the inlet fitting 22 and conveys the internal heat transfer fluid to each cf the plurality of plates 16 along the length of the assembly 10. The internal heattransferfluid flows to and from the bottom fluid manifold 14 along ns path within each piste 16 until it reaches the outlet conduit 36 and discharges out through the outlet Sang 24. The top fluid manifold 12 at the position of each plate 18, further includes one or mere turning cavities 40 and a recessed region 42 aligned with each plate 16. Tne turning cavity 40 serves to direct fluid flowing out of the plate 16 and return it back into the plate' 16 for a continuous flow as will be described in detail. The recessed region 42 is adapted to receive and securely retain an end portion 44 of the corresponding plate 16 for a fluid-tight seal fit therebetween.<br><br>
Optionally, the top fluid manifold 12 includes a, optional bypass conduit 38 which extends longitudinally through the turning cavity 40 associated with each plate 16. The bypass conduit 38 provides open fluid communication between adjacent turning cavities 40. The bypass conduit 38 permits the internal heat exchange fluid to bypass a plate 16 if one or more passages 54 in the plate 16 are blocked or obstructed. During normal operation, little or no fluid is exchanged between the plates 16 at the fluidly connected turning cavities 40. However, when one or more passages 54 are blocked or obstructed in a plate 16, the corresponding fluid may circurnvent the blockage by traversing a bypass conduit 38 to thereby flow into an adjacent unobstructed plate 16.<br>
The bottom fluid manifold 14 is structurally sim8ar to the top fluid manifold 12. The bottom fluid manifold 14 indudes an end wall 46, and a pair of side walls 48 extending longitudinally along the edge cf the end wail 46. The bottom fluid manifold at the position of each plate, further 14 induces one or more turning cavities 40 and a recessed region 42 afigned with each plate. The turning cavity 40 serves to direct fluid flowing out of the plate 16 and return c back km: me ptete 16 for a continuous flow thereof. The recessed region 42 is acacec ID receive and seeureiy retain an end portion 50 of the corresponding plate 16 for a fluid tight seal. The bottom fluid manifold 14 may optionally include one or more bypass conduits 38 with each bypass conduit 38 aligned with an individual piate 16. The arrangement of plates 16 and the manifolds securing the same enable the bypass conduits 38 to extend aJong the length of the assembly 10 and provide fluid commuracation between the turning cavities 40 associated with the individual plates that are Jongitudfaafly afigned with one another in<br><br>
the assembly 10. The function of the bypass conduits 38 in the bottom fluid manifold 14 is the same as described above for the top fluid manifold 12.<br>
Referring to Figure 4, the flow path of the internal heat transfer fluid through the top and bottom fluid manifolds 12 and 14, respectively, and the plate 16 is illustrated in detail. The plate 16 comprises a plurality of spaced apart walls 52 defining a plurality of open-ended passages 54 for conveying a fluid.. The top and bottom fluid manifolds 12 and 14, respectively, include one or more barriers 56 for enclosing the respective conduits, turning cavities and passages associated with the individual plates 16 to facilitate an orderly fluid flow. Fluid tends to flow in the dkection from a region of high pressure (i.e. inlet conduit 34) to a region of low pressure (i.e. outlet conduit 36). The internal heat transfer fluid first enters the inlet conduit 34 via the inlet fitting 22 and flows through at least one passage 54 in the direction of arrows "A" towards the bottom fluid manifold 14. The fluid enters the turning cavity 40 which directs the ffow 160* back frrto the plate 16 in the direction of arrows "B" towards the top fluid manifold 12. The Hukl turns two more times before entering the outlet condut 36 and out of the assembly through the outlet fitting 24. The internal heat transfer fluid Hows through each plate 16 cf the assembly 10 in a parallel manner.   During operation, it is preferable for the external fluid medium to flow in the direction opposite to the general flow of the internal heat transfer fluid in the plate 16.<br>
As previously indicated the manifolds 12 and 14 define turning cavities 40 which direct the fluid flow back and forth through the plate 16. The number of turning cavities<br><br>
40 provided may vary according to the needs and requirements of the assembly 10.<br>
During a cooling operation, the internal heat transfer fluid is at the outset cooled by a cooling system (not shown) to a temperature lower than that of the external fluid medium (e.g. room air). The cooled internal heat transfer fluid then flows into the heat exchange assembly 10 via inlet fitting 22 (see Figure 2) to the inlet conduit 34 into the plates 16. The internal heat transfer fluid travels along the serpentine-like fluid flow path turning 180° at each turning cavity 40. Since the internal heat transfer fluid is colder than the external fluid medium passing through the spacing 20 between the adjacent plates 16, nest is transferred from the external fluid medium through the wafis .  of the plates 16 to the interna! heat transfer fluid. The external fluid medium depleted of its thermal energy exits the heat exchange assembly 10 and is returned to a receh/ETO area (e-c. room). The internal heat transfer fluid after passing through the plates 16 enters the outlet conduit 36 and leaves the heat exchange assembly 10 via the outlet fitting 24. The operation of the heat exchange assembly 10 during heating is simfer, but wSh the obvious changes in the thermal transfer relationship between the infernal heat transfer fluid and the externa! fluid medium.<br>
Referring to Figures 5A and 5B, the top and bottom end-piece members 26 and 28, respectively, as described in connection with Figure 1 are shown in greater detail. The top end-piece member 26 comprises the turning cavity 40, an inlet thoughhole 58 which forms a portion of the intet conduit 34 of the top fluid manifold 12, an outlet throughhote 60 which forms a portion of the outlet conduit 36 of the too fluid manifold<br><br>
12, and two bypass throughholes 62 which forms a portion of the bypass conduits 38. The top end-piece member 26 includes the recessed region 42 adapted to receive and securely retain the end portion 44 of the corresponding plate 16 for a fluid-tight seal fit therebetween. The edge of the plate 16 abuts against the tip of the barrier 56 to ensure the partitioning of the passages 54 for smooth fluid flow.<br>
The bottom end-piece member 28 is shown in specifically in Figure 5B. The bottom end-piece member 28 comprises two turning cavities 40, and four bypass throughholes 62 each of which forms a portion of the corresponding bypass conduits 38. It wifl be understood that the bottom end-piece member 28 may be configured to include the inlet throughholes 58 and/or the outlet throughholes 60 where it is desirable to have the inlet fittings 22 and/or outiet fittings 24, respectively, located at the bottom fluid manifold 14.<br>
The bottom end-piece member 28 further includes the recessed region 42 adapted to receive and securely retain the end portion 50 of the corresponding plate 16 for a fluid-tight seal fit therebetwesTL The edge of tire piste 16 abuts against the tip of the barrier 56 to ensure the partitioning of the passages 54 for smooth fluid flow. It is noted that the plate 16 may be securely affixed to recessed regions 42 of the end-piece members 26 and 28 by means including, but not limited to, gluing, welding, fusing, bonding, fastening, damping and the like.<br>
The number of turning cavities 40 in the end-piece members 26 and 28,<br><br>
respectively, may vary according to the requirements of the assembly 10.   |„ the present embodiment, it is noted that the internal heat transfer fluid makes three 180° turns along its path through the piate 16 (as shown in Figure 4). This configuration is referred to as a four-pass heat exchanger noting that the serpenfine-te fluid flow path followed by the interna! heat transfer fluid includes four straight sections. The turning cavities 40 are partitioned from one another and from the inlet and outlet throughholes 58 and 60, respectively, if present, by the barriers 56. The barriers prevent the interna) heat transfer fluid from circumventing around the plate 16. Preferably, each turning cavity 40 includes a depth of about equal or greaterthan the thickness of the plate 16 or me passages 54 in the plate 16 for maximizing an unobstructed flow into or out of the corresponding plates 16.<br>
*<br>
Tne bypass throughholes 62 may optional be included in the end-piece members 2S and 28, respectively, and are not crfficai to the operation of the assembly<br>
10. ThebypassthroughholesSaformrhebypasscorc-ufeSSintheassemblylO. The bypass conduits 38 are adapted for altovAc ft. fe^, heat ^.^ ^ ^g jn<br>
one plate 16 to flow Wo a parallel one shouid it encounter one or more blocked passages 54 as described above.<br>
The overall thickness of each indWual end-piece member 26 or 28 typically includes the thickness of the affixed plate 16 and the desired spacing width between adjacent plates 16. Preferably, me depth of the recessed regions 42 in the top and bottom end-piece members 26 and 28 equals the thickness of the pfete 16. However.<br><br>
it is noted that the depth of the recessed region may vary relative to the thickness of the plate 16, and may be less than the plate thickness. In the latter, the opposite side of the end-piece member 26 or 28 may further include a corresponding recessed region for receiving the extended and exposed portion of the plate 16. Similarly, the depth of the recessed region 42 may be greater than the thickness of the plates 16. Therefore, the opposite side of the end-piece member 26 or 28 includes a raised area adapted for a snug fit into the recessed region 42 of the adjacent end-piece member 26 or 28, respectively, against the plate 16 occupying the recessed region 42. in the manner, the plate 16 of the adjacent end-piece member 26 or 28 is securely retained therebetween.<br>
Referring to Figure 5C, the barriers 56 in the top and bottom end-piece members 26 and 28 may be modified to include a bypass channel 64 for a second ernbodiment of the present invenfion. The bypass channel 64 fluidly connects the turning cavities, reservoirs and the conduits, and facilitates the draining of the assembly 10 during maintenance/repai- crthe purging of trapped air or gases during the Wang cft« ffSBmsi heat transfer fluid inn: the assembly 10. The bypass channel 64 is olmenssonec in a manner that the flow rate through the plate 16 is not appreciably affected by the bypass channels 64, preferably tess than 3% of the total flow rate of the internal heat transfer fluid.<br>
Referring to Figure 6, a heat exchange assembly 70 is shown for a third embodiment of the present invention. The heat exchange assembly 70 includes the top<br><br>
fluid manifold 12 and a plate 72. The plate 72 is coupled to the top fluid manifold 12 in the same manner described above. The plate 72 includes the plurality of walls 52 defining the plurality of passages 54 which is open at one end 76 thereof, and two turning cavities 74 at the opposite end 78 thereof. In this configuration, the turning cavities 74 are built into the plate 72 and turn the fluid flow therein. It is noted that the plate 72 may be modified so that the turning cavities 74 are located at the end 76 thereof as disclosed in U.S. Pat No. 5,638,900 incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Referring to Figure 7, a heat exchange assembly 80 is shown for a fourth embodiment of the present nTvention. Tne heat exchange assembly is substantially similar to the heat exchange assembly 10 described above. In this embodiment the heat exchange assembly SO indudes a top fluid manifold 92 and a bottom fluid manifold 94, which, in combmafcn, incorporate a liquid desiccant distribution and collection system. The liquid cesiccanf distribution system is adapted to furnish a thin layer flow of a liquid desiccant over the surface of the plates 16 as will be described hereinafter. The heat exchange assembly SO further induces a desiccant inlet fitting 82 and s desiccant outlet Hsinc 54icr supplying and dtschargmg a liquid desiccant respectively.<br>
With reference to Fgure 8, the top fluid manifold S2 indudes a liquid desiccant supply conduit 86 which extends along the length of the assembly 80 and is adapted for conveying the liquid desiccant from the inlet fitting 82 to the plates 16. Tne liquid desiccant supply conduit 86 branches into a plurality of supply lines 88 each of which carries the liquid desiccant to the spadng 20 between the adjacent plates 16. The<br><br>
liquid desiccant is then dispensed onto the surfaces of the adjacent plates 16 where it flows downwardly towards the bottom fluid manifold 94. The bottom fluid manifold 94 includes a side wall 100 which extends along each side of the bottom fluid manifold 94. The side walls 100 are adapted to hold the liquid desiccant flowing down the surface of the plates 16 and prevent the liquid desiccant from entraining into the external fluid medium passing through the spacings 20. The collected liquid desiccant flows toward one side of the manifold 94 where it passes through a drain 102 located between the plates 16 into a drain conduit 104. The drain conduit 104 extends along the length of the assembly 80. The liquid desiccant is eventually discharged through the desiccant outlet fitting 84 from the drain conduit 104.    The discharged liquid desiccant is subsequently reprocessed or conveyed to a liquid desiccant regenerator (not shown).<br>
Referring to Figure 9A, the top fluid manifold 92 is assembled from a plurality of top end-piece members 96 each of which is coupled totbe end 44 of a plate 16. The top end-piece members 96 are affixed to adjacent ones to form the top fluid manifold 82. Tne top end-piece member 96 includes a supply throughnoie 106 which forms a portion of the supply conduit 86, the supply fine 88, and acfetricution web 108 having rumple distribution grooves 110 disposed on both sides thereof extending from the supply Brie 88. Preferably, the distribute grooves 110 are disposed in a staggered arrangement relative between the grooves 110 on the front and back sides.   The offsetting of the grooves 110 prevents the liquid desiccant from bridging the spacing 20 between the adjacent plates 16.<br><br>
The top end-piece member 96 further includes the recessed region 42 adapted for receiving and securely retaining the end 44 of the plate16. Upon affixing the plate 16 to the top end-piece member 96, the supply line 88 and the distribution grooves 110 are enclosed. The surface of the adjacent plate 16 on the other side of the top end-piece member 96 abuts thereagainst and encloses the supply line 88 and the distribution grooves 110 when the assembly 80 is constructed. During operation, the liquid desiccant flows from the conduit 86 into the supply line 88 and flows into the distribution grooves 110 where it is emptied onto the immediate surfaces of the adjacent plates 16. Optionally, a thin wick (not shown) may be applied to the exposed surfaces of the plate below the distribution grooves 110 for facilitating unSbrm distribution.<br>
The distribution grooves 110 effectively feeds the liquid desiccant to the upper surface of the piate 16. The distribution grooves 110 may be adapted to feed approximately the same flow of liquid desiccant at each dispensing ouifet Since the fluid pressure of the liquid desiccant in the supply line 88 may vary along the length thereof, the dJEtrcutJon grooves would effectively maintain approximately ezusi flows only if the pressure drop is large compared to the pressure variations m Hie supply line 88.<br>
For a given flow rate of liquid desiccant, the pressure drop in the distribution grooves 110 increases as the length of the groove 110 lengthens or the cross sectional diameter decreases. As the diameter of the groove 110 decreases, there is a greater likelihood that dirt, debris, or precipitates will block the groove 110. Alternatively, as the<br><br>
groove 110 lengthens, the distribution web 108 is likewise lengthened. This would undesirably increase the height of the corresponding heat exchange assembly. With reference to Figure 9B, the pressure drop across the groove 110 may be increased by lengthening the grooves noniineariy without lengthening the distribution web 108 as illustrated by grooves 11 OB, 110C, and 110D, respectively.<br>
In the alternative, the liquid desiccant may be supplied by fabricating the distribution web 108 with a porous material such as open-cell plastic foam and the like. The liquid desiccant flows through the holes and saturates the material from the supply line 88. The liquid desiccant passes out from the bottom end of the porous material onto surface of the plates 16.<br>
During operation of ihe heat exchange assembly, ari air bubble may be present in the liquid desiccant wfihin the supply fine 88. The air bubbie is eventually pushed through the distribution grooves 110 where it bursts and creates many small droplets of desiccant which may become undestfabiy entrained in the external fluid medium passing through Hie spadng 20. The entrained Squid desiccant is carried by the external fluid medium where ft lands on an outside surface (e.g. air duct). Since most liquid desiccants are corrosive, the entrained liquid desiccants may cause serious maintenance problems.<br>
With reference to Figure 9C, a top end-piece member 134 includes a purge throughhole 66 to form a purge cavity (not shown) extending along the length of the<br><br>
constructed heat exchange assembly. The purge throughhole 66 is located at the opposite end from the desiccant supply throughhole 106 in communication with the supply line 88. In the heat exchange assembly utilizing the top end-piece member 134, the liquid desiccant flows into the distribution grooves 110 and into the purge cavity through the purge throughhole 66. Due to its lower density, the air bubbles present in the flow would travel along with the liquid desiccant in the supply line 106 and be carried straight into the purge cavity. The liquid desiccant and the air bubbles leaves the purge cavity through a corresponding purge fitting (not shown).<br>
Referring to Figure 9D, the bottom fiuki manifold 94 is assembled from a plurality of bottom end-piece members 98 each of which is ccupied to the end 50 of the plate 16 opposite from the top end-piece member 96. The end 50 of the plate 16 securely fits into the recessed region 42 and affixed thereto for secure retainment abutting against the tip of the bam"er56. A support web 114 is prcvkied for imparting structural rigidity to the corresponding side waii 100. Preferably the thickness of the support web 114 is less than the total thickness of the bcfem end-piece member 98, more preferably one half the thickness of the member 95 to'ibrrn tiie drain 102. The bottom end-piece member 98 further includes a desiccant cxiriciatthroughhote 116 which forms a portion of the desiccant supply conduit 86 of the assembly 80.   Optionally, the recessed region 42 may include a sloped edge portion 112 for funneling the liquid desiccant towards the drain 102. Tne sloped edge portion 112 is preferably inclined from about 5° to 15° from horizontal to facilitate the desiccant flow to the drain 102.<br><br>
Optionally, the sidewall 100 proximate the higher ena OT ine sloped edge portion 112 of the recessed region 42 may further include a leading^edge air dam 118 and the side wall proximate the lower end of the sloped edge portion 112 may further include a trailing edge-air dam 120. The leading and trailing edge-air dams 118 and 120,' respectively, are adapted in combination to shield the liquid desiccant flowing along the sloped edge portion 112 from the external fluid medium passing between the spacings 20, thereby minimizing entrapment of the liquid desiccant in the external fluid medium flow. It is noted that the leading and trailing edge-air dams 118 and 120, respectively, and the sloped edge portion 112 are each optionally included and utilized for applications where the external fluid medium passes at a relatively high velocity.<br>
The construction of the assembly 80 is carried out by coupling the top and bottom end-piece members 96 and 98, respectively, into the configuration shown in Figure 8 to form a plate and end-piece member component fri a similar manner described above for the assembly 10. the components are then sfnxed to one another in a stacked arrangement and affixed using methods kidutfirja, fautnctimfted to, gluing, fusing, bonding, brazing, welding, soldering, fastening and the Bee. Preferably, adhesives are used for bonding plastic component parts. The adhesive may be applied iri the form of a bead to the face of the component parts for coupling. With reference to Figures 10A and 10B, an example of an adhesive bead 122 is shown applied to the recessed regions 42 of the end-piece members 96 and 98, respectively, for coupling with the ends 44 and 50, respectively, of a plate 16. With reference to Figures 11A and 11B, another example of an adhesive bead 122 is shown applied to the face of the end-<br><br>
piece members 96 and 98, respectively, for coupling with the plate 16 and the adjacent plate and end-piece member components in a stacked arrangement to construct the<br>
*<br>
heat exchange assembly 80. Adjacent respective top and bottom end-piece members are joined together to maintain structural integrity of the assembly 80 and to form the corresponding top and bottom fluid manifolds and the corresponding fluid-tight passages and conduits adapted for the passage of the liquid desiccant and the internal heat transfer fluid therethrough.<br>
Referring to Figure 12, a plate and end-piece member component 124 is shown for a sixth embodiment of the present invention. The component 124 includes a curved top end-piece member 126, a curved plate 128, and a curved bottom end-piece member 130. Tne curvature is formed in the direction perpendicular to me internal passages in the piaie 128. Tne end-piece members 126 and 130 and the piste 128 are assembled in the same manner described above to construct a heat exchanae assembly, in tie assembled form, the components 124 improve the vertical compressive bad capacity of the heat exchange assembly formed therefrom. This conSgisaricn rosy be uiiSzed where space availability require multiple heat exchange assembly units to be placed in a stacked arrangement<br>
Referring to Figure 13, a heat exchange assembly 132 is shown for a seventh embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, the inlet and outlet fittings 22 and 24, respectively, are located at the front and rear side of the assembly 132. This illustrates an example that the corresponding fittings may be located on other<br><br>
portions of the neat exchange assembly of the present invention depending on the applications, installation requirements and the like. In the alternative, the bottom fluid manifold may include the inlet and outlet conduits for receiving and discharging the internal heat transfer fluid in the heat exchange assembly. It Is noted that the inlet and outlet fittings 22 and 24, respectively, may be also located on top and bottom portions 95 and 97 of the manifolds 92 and 94, respectively.<br>
Under some conditions when the device of the present invention is performing a heat exchange function, condensation may develop on the outer surface of the plates and travel down the plates to the bottom of the assembly. Under these circumstances it may be advantageous to provide a collection vessel for the condensation or any liquid which may form or be present on the cuiside surface of the plates.<br>
*<br>
With reference to Figure 14, the bottom fluid manifold 94 includes a side wall 100. The side walls 100 are adapted to held the Squid (e.g. condensate) flowing down the surface of the plates 16 and prevent the liquid from entraining into the external fluid medium passing through the spacings 2Q. The collected liquid flows toward one side of the manifold 94 where tt passes through a drain 102 located between the plates 16 into a drain conduit 104. The drain conduit 104 extends along the length of the assembly 80. The liquid is eventually discharged through the outlet fitting 84 from the drain conduit 104.<br>

embodiments of the present invention. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from such discussion, and from the accompanying drawings, claims and example, that various changes, modifications and variations can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the following claims.<br>
