Application No 1445CAL97<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for<br>
preparing an offset 1 ink, more specifically an offset<br>
ink comprising a disazo pigment composition with<br>
exceptional flow ability and viscosity.<br>
2. Description of Related Art<br>
As examples of conventional methods for improving the<br>
flow ability and transparency of printing inks and<br>
coatings containing disazo pigments, Japanese Patent<br>
Application, Second Publication No Sho 45-11026 teaches a<br>
method for mixing sulfonic acid components into disazo<br>
pigments, United States Patent No 3759731 teaches a<br>
method of using disazo pigments formed by using a mixture<br>
of non-polar coupling components and polar coupling<br>
components having carboxylic acid groups and/or sulfonic<br>
acid groups as coupling components, and United States<br>
Patent No 4894094, United States Patent No 4981489 and<br>
Japanese Patent Application, First Publication No Sho C3-<br>
178169 teach a method of using asymmetric disazo pigment<br>
compositions formed from polar coupling components and<br>
non-polar coupling components.<br>
United States Patent No. 4894094, United States<br>
Patent No. 4981489 and Japanese Patent Application, First<br>
Publication No. 63-178169 disclose methods for selectively<br>
producing asymmetric disazo pigments. In earlier disazo<br>
pigment producing methods, as disclosed in United States<br>
Patent No 37599731, a mixture of common symmetric disazo<br>
pigments and symmetric disazo pigments of<br>
acetoacetanilides having carboxylic acid groups and/or<br>
sulfonic acid groups was produced.<br>
Additionally, as methods for improving the heat<br>
stability (transparency) or color strength, there are<br>
methods of producing disazo pigments by mixing coupling<br>
components, which have substituent groups possessing a<br>
hydrogen-bonding property, with common coupling components.<br>
For example, Japanese Patent Application, Second<br>
Publication No Sho 59-19150 teaches a method of producing<br>
disazo pigments by mixing coupling components having<br>
carboxylic acid amide groups into common coupling<br>
components, Japanese Patent Application, First Publication<br>
No Sho 55-89356 teaches a method of producing disazo<br>
pigments by mixing coupling components having acetylammo<br>
groups into common coupling components, United States<br>
Patent No 4665163 teaches a method of producing disazo<br>
pigments bv mixing coupling components having<br>
benzimidazolone groups into common coupling components,<br>
and Japanese Patent Application, First Publication No Sho<br>
62-197460 teaches a method of producing disazo pigments by<br>
mixing coupling components having sulfonamide groups into<br>
common coupling components. However, the compositions of<br>
the disazo pigments due to these production methods are<br>
believed to be mixed crystals (Japanese Patent Application,<br>
Second Publication No. Sho 59-19150) or mixtures of<br>
symmetric disazo pigments of acetoacetanilides, which have<br>
substituent groups possessing a hydrogen-bonding property,<br>
and common symmetric disazo pigments, and the methods for<br>
producing asymmetric disazo compounds and their effects<br>
have not been conventionally known.<br>
The flow ability, heat stability and color strength<br>
of inks and coatings have been independently resolved in<br>
the conventional art. In particular, while the flow<br>
ability of inks and coatings have been markedly improved<br>
along with the recent trends toward higher speed printing<br>
and coating, the improvements m flow ability have also<br>
resulted m decreases in the viscosity of inks and<br>
coatings Decreases in viscosity can result in various<br>
problems For example, if the viscosity of oil-based inks<br>
decreases, the dot gain increases, the definition of<br>
printed articles is degraded, and an ink flying phenomenon<br>
known as misting occurs upon printing Additionally, with<br>
liquid inks, there is a problem in that bleeding and<br>
mottling occur as a result of permeation and" diffusion of<br>
the ink. Furthermore, in coatings, it is difficult to<br>
retain an appropriate film thickness, and sagging tends to<br>
occur upon coating.<br>
Thus, disazo pigments capable of achieving a high<br>
viscosity while maintaining high flow ability have<br>
heretofore been unknown.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

disazo pigment which has both high, flow ability and high<br>
viscosity when used in inks or coatings, and a printing<br>
ink which has both high flow ability and high viscosity.<br>

The disazo pigment composition of the present<br>
invention containing a disazo pigment, the disazo compound<br>
expressed by general formula (I) and the disazo compound<br>
expressed by general formula (II), can be produced by the<br>
following methods<br>
(a) a method of mixing the disazo compound expressed by<br>
general formula (I) and the disazo compound expressed by<br>
general formula (II) into a disazo pigment synthesized by<br>
a conventional method, then extracting as a press cake<br>
pigment or a powder pigment;<br>
(b) a method of sequentially mixing in a disazo pigment<br>
synthesized by a conventional method, the disazo compound<br>
expressed by general formula (I) and the disazo compound<br>
expressed by general formula (II) which have been<br>
separately stored, when preparing an ink or a coating; or<br>
(c) a method of simultaneously synthesizing a disazo<br>
pigment, the disazo compound expressed by general formula<br>
(I) and the disazo compound expressed by general formula<br>
(II).<br>
More specifically, the above-described method (c) is<br>
a method of obtaining a disazo pigment composition by<br>
mixing a reaction intermediate of the tetrazo compound of<br>
aromatic diamine expressed by general formula (III) and<br>
coupling component A2 with a reaction intermediate of the<br>
tetrazo compound of aromatic diamine expressed by general<br>
formula (III) and coupling component A3, and adding the<br>
mixture, or adding these reaction intermediates without<br>
mixing them, to coupling component A1 to induce a reaction<br>
Alternatively, it is also possible to use a method of<br>
mixing together a pigment composition obtained by reacting<br>
a reaction intermediate of the tetrazo compound of<br>
aromatic diamine expressed by general formula (III) and<br>
coupling component A2 with the coupling component A1, and<br>
a pigment composition obtained by reacting a reaction<br>
intermediate of the tetrazo compound of aromatic diamine<br>
expressed by general formula (III) and coupling component<br>
A3 with the coupling component A1.<br>
In the above-described method (c), the ratio of use<br>
of coupling component A2, coupling component A3 and<br>
coupling component Al must be appropriately selected so<br>
that the content of the disazo compound expressed by<br>
general formula (I) and the disazo compound expressed by<br>
general formula (II) in the solid portion of the disazo<br>
pigment composition of the present invention is within the<br>
below-described range.<br>
Among the above-mentioned methods (a)- (c), method (c)<br>
is especially preferable because it is easily capable of<br>
resulting in a disazo pigment composition wherein the<br>
disazo compound expressed by general formula (I) and the<br>
disazo compound expressed by general formula (II) are<br>
finely dispersed in the disazo pigment.<br>
When producing the disazo pigment composition of the<br>
present invention, it is preferable that the disazo<br>
pigment, the disazo compound expressed by general formula<br>
(I) and the disazo compound expressed by general formula<br>
(II) have a common skeletal structure, for example, by<br>
selecting the disazo pigment expressed by general formula<br>
(VII), the disazo compound expressed by general formula<br>
(I) and the disazo compound expressed by general formula<br>
(II) such that X, Y and Z1 are identical in all of the<br>
general formulas, due to the high dispersion effects which<br>
can be obtained.<br>
The proportional content of the disazo pigment, the<br>
disazo compound expressed by general formula (I) and the<br>
disazo compound expressed by general formula (II) in the<br>
disazo pigment composition of the present invention is<br>
important in order to obtain a disazo pigment composition<br>
having both high flow ability and high viscosity. The<br>
proportional content of the disazo compound expressed by<br>
general formula (I) in the solid portion of the disazo<br>
pigment composition of the present invention should<br>
preferably be within the range of 0.5--49% by weight, and<br>
more preferably in the range of 1-20% by weight when<br>
considering the raw material cost When the proportional<br>
content of the disazo compound expressed by general<br>
formula (I) in the disazo pigment composition is less than<br>
0.5% by weight, the viscosity of the resulting ink or<br>
coating tends to become reduced, while if more than 49% by<br>
weight, the flow ability of the resulting ink or coating<br>
tends to become reduced Additionally, the proportional<br>
content of the disazo compound expressed by general<br>
formula (II) in the solid portion of the disazo pigment<br>
composition of the present invention should preferably be<br>
within the range of 0.5-49% by weight, and more preferably<br>
in the range of 1-20% by weight when considering the raw<br>
material cost. When the proportional content of the disazo<br>
compound expressed by general formula (II) in the disazo<br>
pigment composition is less than 0.5% by weight, the flow<br>
ability of the resulting ink or coating tends to become<br>
reduced, while if more than 49% by weight, the viscosity<br>
of the resulting ink or coating tends to become reduced.<br>
In the solid portion of the disazo pigment<br>
composition of the present invention, the total<br>
proportional content of the disazo compound expressed by<br>
general formula (I) and the disazo compound expressed by<br>
general formula (II) should preferably be within the range<br>
of 1-49% by weight, and more preferably within the range<br>
of 4-35% by weight Additionally, the weight ratio<br>
(I)/(II) of the disazo compound expressed by general<br>
formula (I) and the disazo compound expressed by general<br>
formula (II) should preferably be within the range of<br>
20/80-80/20, and more preferably within the range of<br>
30/70-75/25<br>

(a varnish containing rosin phenolic resin manufactured by<br>
Dainippon Ink and Chemical) to a flusher heated to 60°C, a<br>
pigment press cake was added in an amount corresponding to<br>
100 parts when converting for the solid portion of the<br>
pigment, and the result was flushed while kneading for 30<br>
minutes. After decanting the free water, the flusher<br>
temperature was raised to 80°C while vacuum dehydrating in<br>
order to remove the water content. After confirming that<br>
the water content had been removed, 170 parts of the<br>
lithographic ink varnish (a varnish containing rosin<br>
phenolic resin manufactured by Dainippon Ink and Chemical)<br>
and 30 parts of light oil were gradually added to obtain a<br>
test ink<br>
The flow ability and laray viscosity of the test inks<br>
prepared by the above procedures were measured, and the<br>
results are shown in Table 1.<br>
With regard to the numerical values for the flow<br>
ability, higher values indicate that the lithographic ink<br>
has higher flow ability. With regard to the numerical<br>
values for the laray viscosity, higher values indicate<br>
that the lithographic ink has higher viscosity.<br>
It should be noted that the flow ability was<br>
evaluated by kneading 1 g of printing ink for 1 minute<br>
using a spatula, putting the printing ink on the higher<br>
end of a glass plate which is placed with an inclination<br>
angle of 70°, waiting for 60 minutes, and measuring the<br>
length of the printing ink which has run toward a lower<br>
position (the length of the printing ink from the highest<br>
end to the lowest end).<br>
The results shown in Table 1 demonstrate that the<br>
lithographic inks which use the disazo pigment<br>
compositions of the present invention obtained in Examples<br>
1-5 have both high flow ability and high viscosity. On the<br>
other hand, the conventional disazo pigments obtained in<br>
Comparative Examples 1-10 form lithographic inks either<br>
having high flow ability but low viscosity or having high<br>
viscosity but low flow ability, and they do not have both<br>
high flow ability and high viscosity.<br><test example><br>
Using the following procedures, the pigment powders<br>
obtained in Examples 6-7 and Comparative Examples 11-14<br>
were formed into inks.<br>
Specifically, 300 parts of a lithographic ink varnish<br>
heated to 40°C and 100 parts of a pigment powder were put<br>
into a stainless steel vessel, then mixed with a lab mixer<br>
to prepare a mill base. This mill base was milled by using<br>
a triple roll mill to prepare a base ink In the triple<br>
roll mill, 170 parts of the lithographic ink varnish and<br>
30 parts of light oil were gradually added to the base ink<br>
to prepare a test ink<br>
The flow ability and laray viscosity of the test inks<br>
prepared by the above procedures were measured, and the<br>
results are shown in Table 2<br>
The results shown in Table 2 demonstrate that the<br>
lithographic inks which use the disazo pigment<br>
compositions of the present invention obtained in Examples<br>
6-7 have both high flow ability and high viscosity. On the<br>
other hand, the conventional disazo pigments obtained in<br>
