The compounds of the present invention are useful pharma¬ceuticals for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias of all types of origin and for the prevention of sudden heart death due to arrhythmia and can therefore be used as antiarrhythmics. Examples of arrhythmic disorders of the heart are supraventricular arrhythmias such as atrial tachycardias, atrial flutters or paroxysmal supraventri¬cular arrhythmias or ventricular arrhythmias such as ventricular extrasystoles, but in particular life-threatening ventricular tachycardias or the particularly<br><br>
dangerous ventricular fibrillation. They are suitable, in particular, for those cases where arrhythmias are the consequence of a constriction of a coronary vessel, such as occur in angina pectoris or during an acute cardiac infarct or as a chronic consequence of a cardiac infarct. They are therefore particularly suitable in postinfarct patients for the prevention of sudden heart death* Further syndromes where arrhythmias of this type and/or sudden heart death due to arrhythmia play a part are, for example, cardiac insufficiency or cardiac hypertrophy as a consequence of a chronically increased blood pressure. Moreover/ the compounds can positively affect a decreased contractility of the heart. This can include a disease-related fall in cardiac contractility, such as in cardiac insufficiency, but also acute cases such as heart failure in the case of the effects of shock. Likewise, in the case of a heart transplantation, after operation has taken place the heart can resume its operational capacity more rapidly and reliably. The same applies to operations on the heart, which necessitate a temporary stopping of cardiac activity by means of cardioplegic solutions.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to a process for the preparation of the compounds I, which comprises<br>
(a) reacting aromatic sulfonamides of the formula II<br><br>
or their salts of the formula XXI<br><br><br>
with R(l)-siibatituted isocyanates of the formula IV<br>
R(l) -N=C=0 to give sxibstituted benzenesulfonylureas I a (E = oxygen)<br><br>
Suitable cations M in the salts of the formula III are alkali metal/ alkaline earth metal, ammonium and tetra-alkylammonium ions. Equivalently to the R(l)-substituted isocyanates IV, R(1) substituted carbamic acid esters, R(l)-substituted carbamoyl halides or R(l)-substituted ureas can be employed.<br>
(b)	Unsubstituted benzenesulfonylureas I a [R(l) = H, E = O]<br>
can be prepared by reaction of an aromatic benzenes-<br>
ulfonamide of the formula II or of its salt III with<br>
trialkylsilyl isocyanate or silicon tetraisocyanate and<br>
cleavage (e.g. hydrolysis) of the primary silicon-substi¬<br>
tuted benzenesulfonylureas.<br>
It is furthermore possible to convert a benzenesulfon-amide II or its salt III into a benzenesulfonylurea I a by reaction with cyanogen halides and hydrolysis of the primarily formed N-cyanosulfonamides with mineral acids at temperatures from O°C to 100°C.<br>
(c)	A benzenesulfonylurea X a (where E = oxygen) can be<br>
prepared from an aromatic benzene sulfonamide II or its<br>
salt III using an R(l)-substituted trichloroacetamide of<br>
the formula V<br><br><br>
in the presence of a base in an inert solvent according to Synthesis 1987, 734-735 at temperatures from 25°C to 150°C.<br>
Suitable bases are, for example, alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydroxides, hydrides, amides or alternatively alkoxides, such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, sodium hydride, potassium hydride, calcium hydride, sodium amide, potassitim amide, sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, potassium methoxide or potas¬sium ethoxide. Suitable inert solvents are ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether (diglyme), ketones such as acetone or butanone, nitriles such as acetonitrile, nitro compounds such as nitromethane, esters such as ethyl acetate, amides such as dimethylformamide (DMF) or N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), hexamethylphosphoramide, sulfoxides such as DMSO, sul-fones such as sulfolane, hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylenes. Furthermore, mixtures of these solvents with one another are also suitable.<br><br>
is prepared from a benzenesulfonamide II or its salt III and an R(l)-substituted isothiocyanate VI<br>
R(l)-N=C=S.<br>
An unsubstituted benzenesulfonylthiourea lb [R(l) = H, X - S] can be prepared by reaction of an aromatic benz-<br><br>
enesulfonamide II or its salt III with trimethylsilyl isothiocyanate or silicon tetraisothiocyanate and cleav¬age (hydrolysis) of the primarily formed silicon-substi¬tuted benzenesulfonylurea. Furthermore, it is possible to react an aromatic benzenesulfonamide IX or its salt III with benzoyl isothiocyemate and to react the intermediate benzoyl-substituted benzenesulfonylthiourea with an aqueous mineral acid to give I b [R(l) = H, E = S] * Similar processes are described in J. Med, Chem. 1992/ 35/ 1137-1144. A further variant consists in reacting the N-cyanosulfonamides mentioned under process 1 with hydrogen sulfide.<br>
(e)	A substituted benzenesulfonylurea of the formula I a<br>
(E = oxygen) can be prepared by a conversion reaction of<br>
a benzenesulfonylthiourea of the structure lb (E = S) .<br>
The replacement of the sulfur atom by an oxygen atom in<br>
the appropriately substituted benzenesulfonylthiourea can<br>
be carried out, for example, with the aid of oxides or<br>
salts of heavy metals or also by use of oxidants such as<br>
hydrogen peroxide, sodium peroxide or nitrous acid. A<br>
thiourea can also be desulfurized by treatment with<br>
phosgene or phosphorus pentachloride. The intermediate<br>
compounds obtained are chloroformamidines or carbo-<br>
diimides, which are converted into the corresponding<br>
substituted benzenesulfonylureas, for example, by hydro¬<br>
lysis or addition of water. During desulfurization,<br>
isothioureas behave like thioureas and can accordingly<br>
also be used as starting substances for these reactions.<br>
(f)	A benzenesulfonylurea I a can be prepared from a<br>
benzenesulfonyl halide of the formula VII<br><br><br>
using an R(l)-substituted urea or an R(l)-substituted bis(trialkylsilyl)urea. Furthermore, the sulfonyl chlor¬ide VII can be reacted with parabanic acid to give a benzenesulfonylparabanic acid whose hydrolysis with mineral acids yields the corresponding benzenesulfonyl-urea I a.<br>
(g) A benzenesulfonylurea I a can be prepared by reaction of an amine of the formula R(l) -NH2 with a benzenesul-fonyl isocyanate of the formula VIII<br><br>
Likewise, an amine R(l) -NH2 can be reacted with a benzenesulfonylcarbamic acid ester, a -carbamoyl halide or a benzenesulfonylurea I a [where R(l) = H] to give the compounds I a.<br>
(h) A benzenesulfonylthiourea I b can be prepared by reaction of an amine of the formula R(1)-NH2 with a benz¬enesulfonyl isothiocyanate of the formula IX<br><br>
Likewise, an amine R(1)-NH2 can be reacted with a benz¬enesulfonylcarbamic acid thioester or a thiocarbamoyl halide to give the compounds I b.<br>
The sulfonyl isothiocyanates were prepared by reaction of a corresponding sulfonamide with eguimolar amounts of alkali metal hydroxide and carbon disulfide in an organic solvent, such as DMF, DMSO or N-methylpyrrolidone • The di-alkali metal salt of the sulfonyldithiocarbamic acid obtained is reacted in an inert solvent with a slight<br><br>
excess of phosgene/ or substitute of the same, such as triphosgene, a chlorofonnic acid ester (2 equivalents) or thionyl chloride. The solution of the sulfonyl isothlo-cyanate obtained can be reacted directly with the corre¬sponding amines or ammonia<br>
(i) An appropriately substituted benzenesulf enyl- or -sulfinylurea can be oxidized to give the benzene-sulfonylurea I a using an oxidant, such as hydrogen peroxide, sodium peroxide or nitrous acid.<br>
(j) A benzenesulfonylurea I a can be prepared from a<br>
benzenesulfonylurea of the formula X<br><br>
and R(3)R(4)NH using a dehydrating agent/or by activation with a carbonyl mixde or with a mixed anhydride.<br>
The dehydrating agents employed can be all compounds suitable for the preparation or amide bonds, such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, carbonyldiimidazole or pro-panephosphoric anhydride. The solvents used are inert nonprotic solvents such as THF, DMF, diethyl ether, dichloromethane, as well as mixtures of these solvents.<br>
(k) A benzenesulfonylthiourea I b can be prepared from a benzenesulf onyl thiourea of the formula  xI<br><br>
and R(3)R(4)NH using a dehydrating agent or by activation with a carbonyl halide or with a mixed anhydride.<br><br>
The compounds I and their physiologically acceptable salts are useful therapeutics which are suitable not only as antiarrhythmics/ but as prophylaxis in disorders of the cardiovascular system, cardiac insufficiency, heart transplantation or cerebral vascular disorders in humans or mammals  (for example monkeys,  dogs,  mice,  rats, rabbits, guinea-pigs and cats), Physiologically accept¬able salts of the compounds X are understood according to Remmington's Pharmaceutical Science, 17th edition, 1985, pages 14-18 as meaning compounds of the formula XII<br><br>
which can be prepared from nontoxic organic and inorganic bases and substituted benzenesulfonylureas I. Salts are preferred in this context in which M in the formula XII is a sodium, potassium, rubidium, calcium, magnesium or ammonium ion, and can also be the acid addition products of basic amino acids, such as lysine or arginine.<br>
The starting compounds for the mentioned synthesis processes of the benzenesulfonylureas I are prepared by methods known per se, as are described in the literature (for example in the standard works such as Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie (Methods of Organic Chemistry), Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart; Organic Reactions, John Wiley St Sons, Inc., New York; and also in the patent applications indicated above), namely under<br><br>
reaction conditions which are known and suitable for the reactions mentioned. In this case, use can also be made of variants which are known per se but not mentioned here in more detail. If desired, the starting substances can also be formed in situ in such a way that they are not isolated from the reaction mixture, but immediately reacted further.<br>
The starting compounds for the mentioned synthesis processes of the benzenesulfonyl(thio)ureas I are pre¬pared by methods known per se, as are described in the literature (for example in the standard works such as Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie (Methods of Organic Chemistry), Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart; Organic Reactions, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York; and also in the patent applications indicated above), namely under reaction conditions which are known and suitable for the reactions mentioned. In this case, use can also be made of variants which are known per se but not mentioned here in more detail. If desired, the starting substances can also be formed in situ in such a way that they are not isolated from the reaction mixture, but immediately reacted further.<br>
Suitably substituted carboxylic acids of the formula XIII<br><br>
can thus be subjected to a halosulfonation and the sulfonamide XIV <br>
obtained by subseguent ammonolysis can be reacted with an<br><br>
appropriate amine R(3}R(4)MH after activation o£ the carboxylic acid group to give the carboxaxmide of the formula II <br>
Suitable activation methods are the preparation of the carbonyl chloride or of the ester or mixed carboxylic anhydrides using formyl halides. In addition, the reagents known for amide bond preparation such as carbonyldiimidazole, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and pro-panephosphoric anhydride can be used.<br>
The sulfonamides XIV are prepared by known methods, namely voider reaction conditions which are known and suitable for the reactions mentioned. In this case, use can also be made of variants which are known but not mentioned here in more detail. If desired, the syntheses can be carried out in one, two or more steps. In particu¬lar, processes are preferred in which the acid XIII is converted into aromatic sulfonic acids and their derivat¬ives, such as sulfonyl halides, by electrophilic reagents in the presence or absence of inert solvents at tempera-tures from -10°C to 120°C, preferably from 0°C to 100°C, For example,  sulfonations can be carried out using sulfuric acids or oleum, halosulfonations using halo-sulfonic acids, reactions with sulfuryl halides in the presence of anhydrous metal halides or with thionyl halides in the presence of anhydrous metal halides with subsequent oxidations, which are carried out in a known manner, to give aromatic sulfonyl chlorides. If sulfonic acids are the primary reaction products, these can be converted into sulfonyl halides in a known manner by acid halides,  such  as  phosphorus  trihalides,  phosphorus pentahalides, phosphorus oxychloride, thionyl halides or<br><br>
oxalyl halides, either directly or by treatment with tertiary amines, such as pyridine or trialkylamines, or with alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydroxides or reagents which form these basic compounds in situ. The sulfonic acid derivatives are converted into sulfonamides in  a manner known  from  the  literature,  preferably sulfonyl chlorides are reacted in inert solvents with aqueous ammonia in acetone or THF at temperatures from 0°C to 100°C. Furthermore, aromatic sulfonamides XIV can be synthesized according to processes described in the literature from the acids XIII or their esters by reac¬tions with organic reagents of alkali metals or alkaline earth metals in inert solvents and under an inert gas atmosphere at temperatures from -100°C to 50°C, prefer-ably from -100°C to 30C,  with sul fur dioxide and subsequent thermal treatment with an NH2 donor, such as sulfamic acid.<br>
The compounds I according to the invention and their physiologically acceptable salts can be used for the production of pharmaceutical preparations, in particular by a nonchemical route. In this context, they can be brought into a suitable dose form together with at least one solid or liquid excipient or auxiliary on their own or in combination with other pharmaceuticals having cardiovascular activity, such as calcium antagonists, NO donors or ACE inhibitors. These preparations can be used as pharmaceuticals in human or veterinary medicine. Possible excipients are organic or inorganic substances which are suitable for enteral (for example oral) or parenteral administration, for example intravenous administration, or topical applications and do not react with the novel compounds, for example water, vegetable oils, benzyl alcohols, polyethylene glycols, glycerol triacetate, gelatin, carbohydrates such as lactose or starch, magnesium stearate, talc, lanolin and petroleum jelly. In particular, tablets, coated tablets, capsules, syrups, juices or drops are used for oral administration, solutions, preferably oily or aqueous solutions, and also<br><br>
suspensions, emulsions or implants, are used for rectal administration, and creams, pastes, lotions, gels, sprays, foams, aerosols, solutions (for example in alcohols such as ethanol or isopropanol, acetonitrile, DMF, dimethylacetamide, 1, 2-propanediol or their mixtures with one another or with water) or powders are used for topical application. The novel compounds can also be lyophilized and the lyophilizates obtained used, for example, for the production of injection preparations. In particular for topical application, liposomal prepara¬tions are also suitable. They contain stabilizers and/or wetting agents, emulsifiers, salts and/or auxiliaries such as lubriccants, preservatives, salts for affecting the osmotic pressure, buffer substances, colorants and flavorings and/or aromatic substances. If desired, they can also contain one or more further active compounds, for example one or more vitamins.<br>
The doses which are necessary for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias with the compounds I depend on whether the therapy is acute or prophylactic. Normally, a dose range of approximately at least 0.1 mg, preferably at least 1 mg, up to at most 100 mg, preferably up to at most 10 mg, per kg per day is adequate if prophylaxis is conducted. The dose can in this case be divided as an oral or parenteral individual dose or else in up to four individual doses* l£ acute cases of cardiac arrhythmias are treated, for example in an intensive care unit, parenteral administration can be advantageous. A preferred dose range in critical situations can then be 10 to 100 mg and be administered, for example, as an intravenous continuous infusion.<br>

Preparation of the starting materials<br>
Preparation of 3-sulfamoylphenylalkanecarboxylic acids<br>
The 4-substituted phenylalkanecarboxylic acids are added  in portions  with  stirring  to  an  excess  of<br><br>
chlorosulfonic acid. The mixture is stirred for 30 min¬utes at room temperature, then poured onto ice and the resulting sulfonyl chloride is filtered off with suction. The latter is dissolved in ammonia solution, stirred at room temperature for 3 0 minutes, and the solution is neutralized using 2N hydrochloric acid. The product obtained is filtered off with suction.<br>
Prepared according to this method: 3 -Sulfamoyl-4-methoxyphenyl-3-propionic acid M.p. 172-176°C<br>
3-Sulfamoyl-4-methoxyphenylacetic acid M.p. 164°C<br>
Preparation of 3-sulfonyl2unino-N- (methylaminothio-carbonyl)-4-methoxyphenylacetic acid<br>
5 g of 3-sulfamoyl-4-methoxyphenylacetic acid are dis-solved in 3 ml of DMF and stirred at 40°C for 3 0 minutes with 245 mg of sodium hydroxide. 328 mg of methyl iso-thiocyanate are added thereto and the mixture is stirred for a further 2 h at 70°C. 2N hydrochloric acid is added to the cooled solution and the product is filtered off with suction. M.p. 174°C.<br>
Preparation of N-5-(l-phenylethyl)aminocarbonylmethyl-2-<br>
methoxysulfamoylbenzene<br>
2 .45  g  (0 .01 mol)  of  3-sulf amoyl-4-me thoxyphenyl-ace tic<br>
acid and 4.0 g of trie thy lamine are_ dissolved in 25 ml of DMF and treated with propanephosphonic anhydride (0.015 mol; 50 % str_ength in DMF) and then with 1.2 g (0.01 mol) 1-phenylethy 1-amine with ice cooling. The mixture is stirred for 3 hours at RT and poured onto water. After some time, the product crystallizes and can fr_equently be used without further-purification for further reactions.<br>
The following are obtained analogously<br>
N-5- (1-Phenylethyl) aminocarbonylmethyl-2-ethoxy<br><br><br>

0.01 mol of a sulfonamide II are dissolved in 25 ml of<br>
DMF and treated with 0.006 mol of K2CO3, 0.011 mol of an<br>
iso(thio)cyanate is added with stirring and the mixture<br>
is heated at 60-80°C for approximately 2-6 hours. The<br>
mixture is poured onto ice water and acidified with 2 N<br>
HCl. The deposited crystals are filtered off with suction<br>
and optionally purified by recrystallization or by<br>
chromatography on silica gel. In many cases, however, the<br>
reaction is quantitative or the product crystallizes out<br>
in pure form after acidifying.<br>

The therapeutic properties of the compounds I can be revealed using the following models:<br>
(1)  Action potential duration on the papillary muscle of the guinea-pig:<br>
(a)	Introduction<br>
ATP deficiency states, as are observed during ischemia in the cardiac muscle cell, lead to a reduction of the action potential duration. They count as one of the causes of so-called reentry arrhythmias, which can cause sudden heart death. The opening of ATP-sensitive K channels as a result of the fall of ATP counts as causal here*<br>
(b)	Method<br>
To measure the action potential, a standard micro-electrode technique is employed. For this, guinea-pigs of both sexes are killed by a blow to the head, the hearts are removed, and the papillazry muscles are separated out and suspended in an organ bath. The organ bath is irrigated with Ringer solution (0.9% NaCl, 0.048% KCl, 0.024% CaCl2, 0-02% NaHCO3 and 0.1% glucose) and aerated with a mixture of 95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide at a temperature of 3 6°C. The muscle is stimulated by means of<br><br>
an electrode using square-wave impulses of 1 V and 1 ms duration and a frequency of 2 Hz, The action potential is derived and recorded by means of a glass microelectrode inserted intracellularly, which is filled with 3 mM KCl solution. The substances to be tested were added to the Ringer solution in a concentration of 2.2-10-5 mol per liter. The action potential is amplified using an amplifier from Hugo Sachs and shown on an oscilloscope. The duration of the action potential is determined at a degree of repolarization of 95% (APD95)-<br>
Action potential reductions are produced either by addition of a 1 µm-strength solution of the potassium channel opener Hoe 234 (J, Kaiser, H. Gogelein, Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharm. 1991, 343/ R 59) or by addi¬tion of 2-deoxygluGose. The action potential-reducing effect of these substances was prevented or reduced by the simultaneous addition of the test substances. Test substances were added to the bath solution as stock solutions in propanediol. The values indicated relate to measurements 30 minutes after addition. Glibenclamide was used in these measurements as a standard. The test concentration in all cases is 2 x 10-6 M.<br>
