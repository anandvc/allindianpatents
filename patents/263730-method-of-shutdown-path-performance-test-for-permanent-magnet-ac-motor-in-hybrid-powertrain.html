CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/986,414, filed on November 8, 2007. The disclosure of the<br>
above application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] The present disclosure relates to hybrid vehicles, and more<br>
particularly to shutdown path diagnostics for a motor of a hybrid vehicle.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The background description provided herein is for the purpose<br>
of generally presenting the context of the disclosure. Work of the presently<br>
named inventors, to the extent it is described in this background section, as well<br>
as aspects of the description that may not otherwise qualify as prior art at the<br>
time of filing, are neither expressly nor impliedly admitted as prior art against the<br>
present disclosure.<br>
[0004] Referring now to FIG. 1, an exemplary electric hybrid vehicle 10<br>
is shown. The electric hybrid vehicle 10 includes an engine assembly 12, a<br>
hybrid power assembly 14, a transmission 16, a drive axle 18, and a control<br>
module 20. The engine assembly 12 includes an internal combustion engine 22<br>
General Motors No. P002543-PTH-CD-RRM<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000704<br>
that is in communication with an intake system 24, a fuel system 26, and an<br>
ignition system 28.<br>
[0005] The intake system 24 includes an intake manifold 30, a throttle<br>
32, and an electronic throttle control (ETC) 34. The ETC 34 controls the throttle<br>
32 to control airflow into the engine 22. The fuel system 26 includes fuel<br>
injectors (not shown) to control a fuel flow into the engine 22. The ignition<br>
system 28 ignites an air/fuel mixture provided to the engine 22 by the intake<br>
system 24 and the fuel system 26.<br>
[0006] The engine 22 is coupled to the transmission 16 via a coupling<br>
device 44. The coupling device 44 may include one or more clutches and/or a<br>
torque converter. The engine 22 generates torque to drive the transmission 16<br>
and propel the electric hybrid vehicle 10. The transmission 16 transfers power<br>
from the engine 22 to an output shaft 46, which rotatably drives the drive axle 18.<br>
[0007] The hybrid power assembly 14 includes one or more motor<br>
generator units. For example only, as shown in FIG. 1, the hybrid power<br>
assembly 14 includes two motor generator units: a first motor generator unit<br>
(MGU) 38 and a second MGU 40. The hybrid power assembly 14 also includes<br>
a power control device 41 and a rechargeable battery 42.<br>
[0008] The first and second MGUs 38 and 40 operate independently<br>
and at any given time may each operate as either a motor or a generator. An<br>
MGU operating as a motor supplies power (e.g., torque), all or a portion of which<br>
may be used to drive the output shaft 46. An MGU operating as a generator<br>
converts mechanical power into electrical power.<br>
General Motors No. P002543-PTH-CD-RRM<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000704<br>
[0009] For example only, the first MGU 38 may generate electrical<br>
power based on the output of the engine 22, and the second MGU 40 may<br>
generate electrical power based on the output shaft 46. Electrical power<br>
generated by one of the MGUs 38 and 40 may be used , for example, to power<br>
the other of the MGUs 38 and 40, to recharge the battery 42, and/or to power<br>
electrical components. While the MGUs 38 and 40 are shown as being located<br>
within the transmission 16, the MGUs 38 and 40 may be located in any suitable<br>
location.<br>
[0010] The control module 20 is in communication with the fuel system<br>
26, the ignition system 28, the ETC 34, the MGUs 38 and 40, the power control<br>
device 41, and the battery 42. The control module 20 is also in communication<br>
with an engine speed sensor 48 that measures an engine speed. For example,<br>
the engine speed may be based on the rotation of the crankshaft. The engine<br>
speed sensor 48 may be located within the engine 22 or at any suitable location,<br>
such as near the crankshaft.<br>
[0011] The control module 20 controls operation of the engine 22 and<br>
the MGUs 38 and 40. The control module 20 also selectively controls recharging<br>
of the battery 42. The control module 20 controls recharging of the battery 42<br>
and the operation of the MGUs 38 and 40 via the power control device 41. The<br>
power control device 41 controls power flow between the battery 42 and the<br>
MGUs 38 and 40. For example only, the power control device 41 may be an<br>
inverter and/or an IGBT (insulated gate bipolar transistor).<br>
General Motors No. P002543-PTH-CD-RRM<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000704<br>
[0012] The control module 20 may include multiple processors for<br>
controlling respective operations of the electric hybrid vehicle 10. For example,<br>
the control module 20 may include a first processor for determining desired<br>
torque for the engine 22 and the MGUs 38 and 40 and a second processor for<br>
controlling torque of each of the MGUs 38 and 40.<br>
SUMMARY<br>

threshold is greater than the second current threshold.<br>
[0022] In further features, the fault diagnostic module disables<br>
operation of the electric motor when the fault is diagnosed.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0039] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is in<br>
no way intended to limit the disclosure, its application, or uses. For purposes of<br>
clarity, the same reference numbers will be used in the drawings to identify<br>
similar elements. As used herein, the phrase at least one of A, B, and C should<br>
be construed to mean a logical (A or B or C), using a non-exclusive logical or. It<br>
should be understood that steps within a method may be executed in different<br>
order without altering the principles of the present disclosure.<br>
[0040] As used herein, the term module refers to an Application<br>
Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor (shared,<br>
dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one or more software or firmware<br>
programs, a combinational logic circuit, and/or other suitable components that<br>
provide the described functionality.<br>
[0041] Referring now to FIG. 2, a functional block diagram of an<br>
exemplary control module 100 of an electric hybrid vehicle according to the<br>
present disclosure is presented. The control module 100 includes a drive<br>
General Motors No. P002543-PTH-CD-RRM<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000704<br>
diagnostic module 102, a hybrid control processor (HCP) 104, and a motor<br>
control processor (MCP) 106. The drive diagnostic module 102 receives various<br>
inputs including, but not limited to, engine speed, motor speed, and motor torque.<br>
[0042] For example, the drive diagnostic module 102 receives the<br>
engine speed from the engine speed sensor 48. The drive diagnostic module<br>
102 also receives a motor speed measured by a motor speed sensor 107 and a<br>
motor torque (Tmot) measured by a motor torque sensor 108. The motor speed<br>
sensor 107 and the motor torque sensor 108 measure the speed and torque of<br>
the MGU 38, respectively. As the electric hybrid vehicle 10 includes more than<br>
one MGU, the drive diagnostic module 102 may receive the motor speed and<br>
torque of more than one MGU. For example, the drive diagnostic module 102<br>
may also receive the motor speed and torque of the second MGU 40.<br>
[0043] The drive diagnostic module 102 generates various signals 110<br>
based on the engine speed, the motor speed, and the motor torque. The HCP<br>
104 receives the signals 110 from the drive diagnostic module 102. The HCP<br>
104 determines a requested motor torque 112 for an MGU based on the received<br>
signals 110. While the HCP 104 is shown as determining the requested motor<br>
torque 112 for the MGU 38, the HCP 104 may determine a requested motor<br>
torque for each of the MGUs 38 and 40.<br>
[0044] The MCP 106 receives the requested motor torque 112 from the<br>
HCP 104 and controls the torque of the first MGU 38 based on the requested<br>
motor torque 112. For example, the MCP 106 may cause power to be supplied<br>
to the MGU 38 in an amount that allows the MGU 38 to produce the requested<br>
General Motors No. P002543-PTH-CD-RRM<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000704<br>
motor torque 112. In other words, the MCP 106 controls the torque of the MGU<br>
38 based on the requested motor torque 112. As such, it is desirable to ensure<br>
that the torque commanded by the MCP 106 accurately corresponds to the<br>
requested motor torque 112.<br>
[0045] The control module 100 may include multiple layers of<br>
security/diagnostics to ensure accuracy and consistency between the HCP 104<br>
and the MCP 106. For example, one layer of diagnostics may relate to<br>
diagnostics of basic components and subsystems such as voltage and current<br>
sensors, temperature sensors, and resolver performance diagnostics. Another<br>
layer of diagnostics may relate to an independent calculation of achieved motor<br>
torque. This independent calculation of the achieved motor torque may be<br>
implemented using separate memory locations for software, calibration variables,<br>
and static variables. Values used in the calculation may be verified (e.g., using<br>
checksum verification) between different execution loops.<br>
[0046] Yet another layer of diagnostics may be implemented to prevent<br>
software execution and/or processor faults of the MCP 106. For example only,<br>
the control module 100 may include a processor such as a Programming Logic<br>
Device (PLD) processor 120. While the PLD processor 120 is shown as being<br>
located external to the MCP 106, the PLD processor 120 may be located in any<br>
suitable location.<br>
[0047] The PLD processor 120 may send a seed value to the MCP<br>
106. The MCP 106 determines a return key value based on the seed value and<br>
transmits the return key to the PLD processor 120. The PLD processor 120<br>
General Motors No. P002543-PTH-CD-RRM<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000704<br>
determines the functionality of the MCP 106 based on the return key (e.g. by<br>
comparing the return key to an expected key). When the return key does not<br>
match the expected key, the PLD processor 120 may implement remedial<br>
actions. For example, the PLD processor 120 may reset the MCP 106 and put<br>
the first MGU 38 into a secure shutdown mode.<br>
[0048] When a fault is detected, the PLD processor 120 and/or the<br>
MCP 106 may initiate a secure shutdown mode for the MGU 38. A procedure for<br>
putting the MGU 38 into the secure shutdown mode may follow one or more<br>
shutdown paths. A shutdown path may include a particular sequence of<br>
measurements and calculations involving the MGU 38. While the principles of<br>
the present application will be discussed as they relate to the MGU 38, the<br>
principles of the present application are also applicable to the second MGU 40<br>
and/or any other MGU.<br>
[0049] The control module 100 may perform one or more shutdown<br>
path tests to determine whether the secure shutdown mode is functioning<br>
properly. For example, the control module 100 may initiate the shutdown path<br>
tests at vehicle startup (e.g., at ignition). The shutdown path tests may ensure<br>
that the MCP 106 and/or the PLD processor 120 can properly shut down the first<br>
MGU 38 when one or more components (e.g., sensors) malfunction and/or when<br>
the control module 100 requests a vehicle shutdown. In various<br>
implementations, the control module 100 includes a fault diagnostic module 122<br>
that performs the shutdown path tests.<br>
General Motors No. P002543-PTH-CD-RRM<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000704<br>
[0050] Shutdown path tests according to the present disclosure may<br>
include, but are not limited to, a Three Phase Short test and a Three Phase Open<br>
test. At vehicle startup, the capability of the MCP 106 to conduct one or more of<br>
these shutdown tests is verified. Inability to verify the shutdown tests may<br>
indicate defects in, for example, the first MGU 38, power stage, and/or the MCP<br>
106.<br>
[0051] The fault diagnostic module 122 may initiate remedial action if it<br>
is unable to verify the proper performance of the shutdown tests. For example<br>
only, the fault diagnostic module 122 may set a fault code, illuminate an<br>
accessory light within the hybrid vehicle, and/or disable operation of the MGU 38.<br>
The fault diagnostic module 122 may disable operation of one of the MGU 38 via<br>
the power control device 41, by disabling the MGU 38 directly, and/or in any<br>
other suitable manner.<br>
[0052] Referring now to FIG. 3, a method 200 of verifying the Three<br>
Phase Short test begins in step 202. The method 200 determines a rotor<br>
position of a rotor within the first MGU 38 in step 204. For example only, the<br>
rotor position may be determined using a resolver or a rotary encoder. In step<br>
206, the method 200 determines a nearest phase angle to the rotor position.<br>
[0053] The first MGU 38 may be operated in a predetermined number<br>
of phases, such as three phases (e.g., phases A, B, and C). Each of the phases<br>
includes a positive portion (+) and a negative portion (-). For example, for the<br>
three phases, the phase angles may be A+, A-, B+, B-, C+, and C-. The nearest<br>
phase angle determined in step 206 may be determined based on one of these<br>
General Motors No. P002543-PTH-CD-RRM<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000704<br>
phase angles. The method 200 commands a d-axis current (i.e., an aligning<br>
current) based on the determined phase angle in step 208. In other words, in<br>
step 208 the method 200 commands a current sufficient to align the rotor with the<br>
nearest phase angle.<br>
[0054] The method 200 determines whether the rotor is properly<br>
aligned with the nearest phase angle in step 210. If true, the method 200<br>
continues to step 211. If false, the method 200 returns to step 208 and continues<br>
to control the current until the rotor is properly aligned with one of the phase<br>
angles.<br>
[0055] The method 200 may determine whether the rotor is properly<br>
aligned with the nearest phase angle, for example, based on a comparison of<br>
currents through each of the phases with a respective threshold. For example<br>
only, a first threshold corresponding to the phase with which the rotor is aligned<br>
may be set based on the aligning current. A second threshold corresponding to<br>
the other two phases (i.e., the phases with which the rotor is not aligned) may be<br>
set based on half of the first threshold. In other words, the second threshold may<br>
be set based on half of the aligning current. In various implementations, the first<br>
and second thresholds may be set based on a predetermined amount or<br>
percentage less than the aligning current and half of the aligning current,<br>
respectively. The method 200 may determine that the rotor is properly aligned<br>
when the phase currents are greater than their respective thresholds.<br>
[0056] In step 211, the method 200 measures of the phase currents for<br>
each of the phases. The method 200 may also record the phase currents.<br>
General Motors No. P002543-PTH-CD-RRM<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000704<br>
These phase currents will be referred to as the base phase currents. The<br>
method 200 initializes a counter with a value set for the Three Phase Short test in<br>
step 212. For example only, the counter value may be set based on a period of<br>
time calibrated based on characteristics of the MGU 38. The counter value is<br>
used to determine the number of iterations of the test. The method 200<br>
determines a PWM duty cycle for the test in step 214. For example, the PWM<br>
duty cycle may be determined to create a short circuit condition of all three<br>
phases.<br>
[0057] In step 215, the method 200 controls the duty cycle to create the<br>
shorted condition in all of the phases. For example only, the method 200 may<br>
control the power control device 41 according to the PWM duty cycle. The<br>
method 200 sums the respective phase currents in step 216. The method 200<br>
decrements the counter value in step 218. In step 220, the method 200<br>
determines whether the counter value is zero. If true, the method 200 continues<br>
to step 221. If false, the method 200 repeats steps 215 through 220 and repeats<br>
summing the respective phase currents.<br>
[0058] In step 221, the method 200 calculates respective normalized<br>
phase currents for each of the phases. For example only, the method 200 may<br>
calculate the normalized phase currents using the equation:<br>
where NCn is the normalized current of the Nth phase, SCN is the summed phase<br>
current of the Nth phase as determined after the final iteration of step 216, and<br>
BCN is the base current of the Nth phase as determined in step 211 multiplied by<br>
General Motors No. P002543-PTH-CD-RRM<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000704<br>
the initial counter value. The method 200 determines whether the respective<br>
normalized currents are within a calibrated range in step 222. If true, the method<br>
200 indicates that the test passed in step 224. If false, the method indicates that<br>
the test failed in step 226. In other implementations, the method 200 may<br>
determine that the test has failed when one or more of the respective normalized<br>
currents is greater than or less than a respective calibrated value.<br>
[0059] The method 200 may also enable or disable operation of the<br>
MGU 38 after steps 224 or 226 are performed, respectively. The method 200<br>
then ends. Alternatively, the method 200 may return to step 202 if the test has<br>
failed. For example, the method 200 may allow a predetermined period of time<br>
after the test has failed in order to pass the test.<br>
[0060] Referring now to FIG. 4, a method 300 of verifying the Three<br>
Phase Open test begins in step 302. The method 300 determines a rotor<br>
position of a rotor within the MGU 38 in step 304. For example only, the method<br>
300 may determine the rotor position using a resolver or a rotary encoder. In<br>
step 306, the method 300 determines a nearest phase angle to the rotor position.<br>
[0061] The MGU 38 may be operated in a predetermined number of<br>
phases, such as three phases (e.g., phases A, B, and C). Each of the phases<br>
includes a positive portion (+) and an negative portion (-). For example, for the<br>
three phases, the phase angles may be A+, A-, B+, B-, C+, and C-. The nearest<br>
phase angle determined in step 306 may be determined based on one of these<br>
phase angles. In step 308, the method 300 commands a d-axis current (i.e., an<br>
aligning current) based on the nearest phase angle. In other words, in step 308<br>
General Motors No. P002543-PTH-CD-RRM<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000704<br>
the method 300 commands a current sufficient to align the rotor of the MGU 38<br>
the nearest phase angle.<br>
[0062] The method 300 determines whether the rotor is properly<br>
aligned with the nearest phase angle in step 310. If true, the method 300<br>
continues to step 311. If false, the method 300 returns to step 308 and continues<br>
to control the current until the rotor is properly aligned with one of the phase<br>
angles.<br>
[0063] The method 300 may determine whether the rotor is properly<br>
aligned based on, for example, a comparison of currents through each of the<br>
phases with a respective threshold. For example only, a first threshold<br>
corresponding to the phase with which the rotor is aligned may be set based on<br>
the aligning current. A second threshold corresponding to the other two phases<br>
(i.e., the phases with which the rotor is not aligned) may be set based on half of<br>
the first threshold. In other words, the second threshold may be set based on<br>
half of the aligning current. In various implementations, the first and second<br>
thresholds may be set based on a predetermined amount or percentage less<br>
than the aligning current and half of the aligning current, respectively. The<br>
method 300 may determine that the rotor is properly aligned when the phase<br>
currents are greater than their respective thresholds.<br>
[0064] In step 311, the method 300 measures of the phase currents of<br>
each of the phases. The method 300 may also record the phase currents.<br>
These phase currents will be referred to as the base phase currents. The<br>
method 300 initializes a counter with a value for the Three Phase Open test in<br>
General Motors No. P002543-PTH-CD-RRM<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000704<br>
step 312. For example only, the counter value may be based on a period of time<br>
calibrated based on characteristics of the MGU 38. The counter value is used to<br>
determine the number of iterations of the test.<br>
[0065] In step 315, the method 300 controls the duty cycle to create an<br>
open circuited condition in all of the phases. For example only, the method 300<br>
may control the power control device 41 according to the PWM duty cycle. The<br>
method 300 sums the respective phase currents in step 316. The method 300<br>
decrements the counter value in step 318. In step 320, the method 300<br>
determines whether the counter value is zero. If true, the method 300 continues<br>
to step 321. If false, the method 300 repeats steps 315 through 320 and repeats<br>
summing the respective phase currents.<br>
[0066] In step 321, the method 300 calculates respective normalized<br>
phase currents for each of the phases. For example only, the method 300 may<br>
calculate the normalized phase currents using the equation:<br><br>
where NCN is the normalized current of the Nth phase, SCn is the summed phase<br>
current of the Nth phase as determined after the final iteration of step 316, and<br>
BCn is the base current of the Nth phase as determined in step 311 multiplied by<br>
the initial counter value. The method 300 determines whether the respective<br>
normalized currents are each less than a threshold in step 322. If true, the<br>
method 300 indicates that the test passed in step 324. If false, the method<br>
indicates that the test failed in step 326.<br>
General Motors No. P002543-PTH-CD-RRM<br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000704<br>
[0067] The method 300 may also enable or disable operation of the<br>
MGU 38 after steps 324 or 326 are performed, respectively. The method 300<br>
then ends. Alternatively, the method 300 may return to step 302 if the test has<br>
failed. For example, the method 300 may allow a predetermined period of time<br>
after the test has failed in order to pass the test.<br>
