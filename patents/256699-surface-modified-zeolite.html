				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>Present invention deals with the cost effective surface modified zeolite materials developed from commercial zeolites and flyash based zeolites treating with surface modifiers like hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (HDTMA-Br). The formation of zeolitic materials with anionic characteristics requires treatment with surfactant with initial concentrations greater than its critical micelle concentration (CMC). The sorption of oxyanions on surfactant modified zeolite (SMZ) may be attributed to surface complexation and surface precipitation. Incorporation of metal ions on SMZ showed improved anion uptake for dearsnification of water probably due to synergistic effect and is able to meet the stringent target of 10 ppb of As on portable water being adopted by most of the countries. High selectivity, faster kinetics and high adsorption capacity ensures cost effectiveness of this product as compared to other low cost products for dearsenification. Zeolite analogues with anionic characteristics have been developed for their applications for removal of arsenic from water. The material developed can also be used to remove other anions like chromium and seleniums</td>

				<td>Field of invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a surface modified zeolite.<br>
Further, it relates to a process for synthesis of surface modified zeolites for sequestration of anions.<br>
More particularly, it relates to a process for removal of toxic elements from water using surface modified zeolite and recovering of the said surface modified zeolite<br>
Background and prior art of the Invention:<br>
In the backdrop of the widespread public concern about vast sections of population potentially like West-Bengal (India) and Bangladesh exposed to consumption of ground water containing high concentration of arsenic, the urgency for delineating appropriate treatment strategy for arsenic removal is realized to overcome the grave threat of chronic arsenic poisoning. Recent epidemiogical evidence of the toxicity of inorganic arsenic suggests that the current maximum contaminant level (MCL) may not be sufficiently protective for human health; the probable WHO guideline value of 10 |j.g/L is based on both estimated health risks and the practical quantitation level. The estimated cost of compliance with more stringent levels (in the range 2-20 |o.g/L) is quite high. The existing treatment technologies, such as coagulation, softening, and adsorption on alumina or activated carbon and reverse osmosis accomplish arsenic removal to meet the current standard of 50 u.g/L. However, imposition of low arsenic MCL is likely to require implementation of new treatment practices or significant modification of the existing treatment practices. It needs to be emphasized that only a few de-arsenification technologies in vogue have been successfully demonstrated in the field. To achieve this stringent target, novel materials need to be developed wherein zeolites are emerging as potential materials, which can be suitably functionalised to target specific pollutants of concern. Zeolites can be best defined as hydrated crystalline, alumino-silicates with uniform pore size, reversible hydration, ion-exchanging sorptive, and sieving ability. These characteristics are to be exploited for targeting anions in specific arsenate/ arsenite ion. It is really challenging to tackle anionic pollutants using functionalised faujasitic zeolites and has been achieved by modifying the surface of the zeolites to selectively target anion.<br>
Reference may be made to Li, Zhaohui, et al. (2000) wherein they studied the removal of oxyanions viz. nitrate, arsenate, chromate, etc. using surface modified clay. Natural kaolinite was treated with hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (HDTMA-Br) to a level twice than that of the cation exchange capacity (CEC). Sorption of each oxyanions was well described<br><br>
by the Langmuir isotherm. Desorption of bromide counter ion indicated that each of the oxyanions was retained by ion exchange on HDTMABr bilayer formed on the organo-kaolinite. It was unaffected by solution in the pH range of 5-9, but at pH 11 the bilayer was affected due to competition of OH" for the anion exchange sites. The results demonstrated that properly prepared organoclays could remove oxyanions as well as non-polar organics, from contaminated water.<br>
Reference may be made to Krishana et al. (2001) wherein adsorption of chromate by surface modified clays like kaolinite and montomorillinonite modified with cationic surfactant hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide was reported. It was observed that the amount of chromate absorbed is dependent on pH and that the removal goes on decreasing with increasing pH and it becomes negligible over pH 8 (23). Clays also have the inherent disadvantage of swelling and shrinkage associated with them and therefore cannot be used effectively for treatment purposes.<br>
Reference may also be made to Li et al. (1998) wherein it has been reported that planar nitrate sorbs more on surfactant modified zeolite surface than tetrahedral chromate. In the presence of sulphate or nitrate, chromate sorption is hindered due to competition or sorption sites, quantitative sorption of nitrate and chromate and desorption of bromide indicate that the sorption of oxyanions is primarily due to surface anion exchange. However, the material has limited exchange potential due to limited exchange capacity of the natural zeolite.<br>
Reference may be made to Tucker et al. (1995) wherein a method for removing anions from water is provided, wherein a complexing agent such as a cationic polyelectrolyte is added to unreacted water. The cationic polyelectrolyte complexes with anions, such as chromate and are filtered. The complex is then treated with a regeneration agent, such as barium chloride or lead chloride to precipitate ions and to regenerate complexing agent, which can be reused for water treatment. However, the method faces difficulty in its practical application for drinking water wherein the requirement of an ultra filtration membrane to retain the retention complex and then regeneration of the same makes the process tedious and expensive.<br>
Reference may be made to Hamann et al. (1994) wherein coagulation and lime softening was reported extensively for the removal of arsenic. Adsorption - coprecipitation with hydrolysing metals such as A13+ and Fe3+ is the most commonly used treatment technique for removing arsenic from water. Iron coagulation achieves high As (III) and As (V) removal<br><br>
than alum coagulation. This mode of treatment generates sludge, disposal of which, in turn maybe a problem.<br>
Willey (1987) studied the use of treatment processes such as reverse osmosis (RO), ion exchange, adsorption or electrodialysis. These methods are quite expensive for usage in domestic purposes.<br>
Reference may be made to Huang et al. (1989) wherein arsenic removal by adsorption has also been evaluated extensively. It was reported therein that activated carbon adsorption was not effective for the removal of arsenic, but pre-treatment of activated carbon with iron salts has been shown to improve the sorption capacity of arsenic. This method suffers form drawback of having lower and limited loading of iron, which in turns decreases, the adsorption capacity.<br>
Reference may be made to Bowman et al. (1998) wherein the uptake of the surfactants hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (HDTMA-Br) by a natural clinoptilolite rich zeolite and subsequent retention of aqueous solutes was studied. SMZ has shown weak sorption capacity for cations such as Pb(II), Sr(II), and strong sorption for anions such as CrO42". This is in contrast to the natural zeolite, which are good cation exchangers. The results suggested formation of stable HDTMABr bilayer on the external surface of zeolite, which retained anions via anion exchange mechanism. SMZ thus proved to be a useful sorbent for anion removal. However, natural zeolite by virtue of its low exchange capacity and other impurities associated, sorbs anion to a lower degree, which can be improved by using synthetic zeolites.<br>
Reference may be made to Alkesaddra et al. (2000) wherein adsorption of sulphate, hydrochromate, and dihydrogen phosphate, anions on the surfactant-modified clinoptilolite was studied. The SMZ was prepared by the adsorption of cis-1 aminooctaden-9 (oleyamine) on both modified and unmodified natural clinoptilolite. It was observed that oleyamine adsorbed on H+-clinoptiolite by protonation of NHa group has shown strong anion adsorbing tendency as compared to Ca and Na-clinoptilolite derivatives, which are weak anion adsorbents. The differences in anion adsorption are attributed to the fact that oleylamine forms hydrogen bonding with Ca and Na-clinoptilolite and thus yields insufficient adsorption sites for anions.<br>
Reference may be made to U.S. Patent 6,326,326, (December 4, 2001) Feng et al. wherein, they developed an organized assembly of functional molecules with specific interfacial functionality (functional group(s)) was attached to available surfaces including within<br><br>
mesopores of a mesoporous material. The method of which the present invention avoids the standard base soak that would digest the walls between the mesopores by boiling the mesoporous material in water for surface preparation then removing all but one or two layers of water molecules on the internal surface of a pore. Suitable functional molecule precursor is then applied to permeate the hydrated pores and the precursor then undergoes condensation to form the functional molecules on the interior surface(s) of the pore(s). These materials are reported to perform at very low concentration and have high adsorption capacity.<br>
Reference may be made to U.S. Patent 5,833,739, (November 10,1998) wherein, Klatte, et al. developed a process for coating zeolite crystals with paraffin, a wax other than paraffin, a fat or oil, or a mixture of at least one QAC and a wax, fat, or oil was reported. Preferably, the crystals were dehydrated until they have about 5% moisture content, and were then mixed with paraffin to produce paraffin-coated zeolite crystals having a desired content of paraffin. Zeolite crystal having pores coated with wax, fat, oil, or a mixture of at least one QAC and wax, fat, or oil is positively charged and has tendency to attract anions. The coating of paraffin/wax applied to zeolite crystal prior to adsorption of QAC may limit its application for removal of anions; in specific arsenic from drinking water.<br>
Reference may be made to Zhaohui Li et al. (1999) wherein, Natural zeolite and ZVI were homogenized and pelletized to maintain favourable hydraulic properties while minimizing materials segregation due to bulk density difference. The zeolite/ZVI pellets were modified with the cationic surfactants hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide to increase contaminant sorption and thus the contaminant concentration on the solid surface. Results of chromate sorption /reduction indicates that the chromate sorption capacity of palletised SMZ/ZVI is at least 1 order of magnitude higher than that of zeolite/ZVI pellets.<br>
The SMZ material developed in the present invention overcomes the following drawbacks of the conventional materials in vogue:<br>
&gt;	Lack of selectivity of conventional adsorbents for arsenic at low concentrations<br>
&gt;	Lack of versatility of conventional for adsorbents for sorption of wide range of<br>
pollutants ranging from cationic to anionic<br>
&gt;	Limited efficiency of conventional adsorbent<br>
&gt;	Frequent regeneration and disposal by virtue of its possible conversion to value added<br>
ceramic precursors by heat treatment<br><br>
&gt;	Transfer of arsenic by stabilization of SMZ at higher temperature<br>
&gt;	Cost effectiveness of other adsorbents by offering single unit for wide array of<br>
pollutants vis-a-vis multiple units required for targeting wide array of pollutants<br>
&gt;	Sludge generation associated with conventional chemical method viz. alum treatment,<br>
chemical precipitation etc.<br>
&gt;	Hazardous chemical handling etc. by providing technically non-tedious and clean<br>
process.<br>
&gt;	Improvisation in quality of life vis-a-vis improved quality of water.<br>

Surface modified zeolite (SMZ) materials have been developed from zeolite, which are being used for targeting wide array of pollutants ranging from cationic to anionic components. The need for this kind of versatile materials for environmental remediation is being realized, wherein, the commercially available zeolites are finding restricted usage due to prohibitive costs for tackling individual pollutants. To overcome this problem, a process for SMZ has been developed which can be exploited for wide array of pollutants thus overcoming the cost implications of tackling individual pollutants. It is of immense practical importance to develop materials with tailored properties to sequester anionic pollutants in addition to cationic pollutants. Zeolites are alumino-silicate materials with properties to attract positive<br><br>
charged ions and, therefore, are widely used for sequestration of cationic pollutants like lead, cadmium and also ammonium ion, generally through ion-exchange process. The first step towards synthesis of SMZs is surface treatment to modify the surface chemistry of zeolite through a simple process of surface modification using surfactant and quaternary ammonium compounds. Treatment of zeolites with surfactant concentration less than critical micelle concentration (CMC) results in the formation of SMZ with hydrophobic characteristics whereas treatment of zeolites with surfactant concentration greater than its CMC renders anionic characteristic to the SMZ. These anionic SMZ have been given an additional treatment with FeSO4 solution to incorporate iron for synergistic effect not reported so far to the best of our knowledge. Treatment of zeolite with mercapto-compounds results in the materials with enhanced selectivity and affinity. This material has not been reported so far to the best of our knowledge. The development of such innovative versatile materials is expected to bring out revolutionary changes in the area of water and waste water treatment by offering a single unit vis-a-vis multiple units required for treatment of waste, which are generally multi component.<br>
In the present invention, it is proposed to overcome the major problem of arsenic removal by developing new materials to attain the stringent target of 10 ppb and offering cost attractive alternative to conventional methods and materials. Faujasitic zeolites are basically cation exchangers and hydrophilic in nature and cannot be used for targeting anions. This challenge is to be met by modifying the surface of the zeolites by treating it with surface modifiers like surfactants and quaternary ammonium and mercapto compounds. The SMZ with increased loading results in the formation of bilayer, which has an affinity for anionic compounds.<br>
Synthesis of Surface Modified Zeolite<br>
Zeolite was washed with distilled water several times till its pH reaches to 10.0 to 10.5. Pre-weighed quantity of washed zeolite sample was then mixed with different initial concentration of surfactant i.e. hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide solution in 1:100 (solid: liquid) ratio. The surfactant concentration was ranging from 100 mg/1 to 800 mg/1 for 10 g of zeolite. The solution was agitated for 7 to 8 hr at 150 rpm on a shaker at pH 8.0 to 8.5. The solution was then filtered and the solid residue was washed with double distilled water and air dried for 4 to 6 hr. The SMZ-A sample synthesized as such was then mechanically ground with a mortar and pestle to fine particle size. Surface modified zeolite having variable surfactant loading was then used for removal of arsenic. The same procedure was repeated for modification of surface zeolite-A/X samples as above for comparative studies. The different<br><br>
surface modified zeolites having different surfactant loading was then used for removal of arsenic in water.<br>
Synthesis of Metal Treated Surface Modified Zeolite<br>
Zeolite A was washed with distilled water several times till its pH reaches to 10.0 to 10.5. Pre weighed quantity of washed zeolite A sample was then mixed with different initial concentration of surfactant i.e. hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (HDTMA-Br) solution in 1:100 (solid : liquid) ratio. The surfactant concentration was ranging from 100 mg/1 to 800 mg/1 for 10 g of zeolite A. The solution was agitated for 7 to 8 hr at 150 rpm on a shaker at pH 8.0 to 8.5. The solution was then filtered and the solid residue was washed with double distilled water and air dried for 6 hr. The SMZ-A sample synthesized as such was then mechanically ground with a mortar and pestle to fine particle size. The metal treatment was given by stirring the SMZ-A in varying quantities of FeSC&gt;4 solution (0.1 - 0.5 M) for 24 hours.<br>
Conversion to ceramic precursors<br>
Zeolite used for sorption of arsenate was separated and dried at 100°C. The dried mass was heated up to 300°C. The heated mass was cooled and crushed. It was then subjected to heating up to 800°C. The sintered mass was subjected to TCLP test for leaching of As and was dissolved in hydrochloric acid to monitor the As content.<br>
Methods of Analysis<br>
Pre-weighted quantity of surface modified zeolite was mixed with 25 ml of solution of arsenic with concentration ranging from 1-5 mg/1 of variable initial concentration. The pH was maintained at about 6.5 to 7.0 by the addition of dilute HC1. The mixture was then shaken on shaker at 150 rpm and filtered. The filtrate was analysed for arsenic using AAS and ICP-AES.<br>
Characterization<br>
SMZ-A, which appears to be suitable for removal of anions, has been characterized with respect to crystallinity, particle size and morphological characteristics. The morphological characteristics of Zeolite-A also appear to be different from that of SMZ-A (P.I) indicating sorption of surfactant. XRD patterns of zeolite-SMZ-A are less in comparison with FAZ-A.<br><br>
Present invention is applicable to the preparation of a very large species of materials since there are more than 140 zeolite crystal structures and large number of surface modifying agent.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention and should not be construed to limit the scope of present invention.<br>
