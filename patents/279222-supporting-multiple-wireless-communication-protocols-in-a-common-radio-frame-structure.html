MEDIUM ACCESS CONTROL FRAME STRUCTURE IN<br>
WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE<br>
[0001]	The present disclosure relates generally to wireless<br>
communications and more specifically to medium access control frame<br>
structures in wireless communication systems with improved latency support.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002]	An important consideration for advanced wireless<br>
communication systems is one-way air-interface latency. Air-interface latency<br>
is primarily dependent on the Medium Access Control (MAC) frame duration.<br>
In the developing IEEE 802.16m protocol, for example, the proposed target<br>
latencv is less than approximately 10 msec and some observers have suggested<br>
that a much lower latency may be required to compete with other developing<br>
protocols, for example, with 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE). The IEEE<br>
802.16m protocol is an evolution of the WiMAX-OFDMA specification for the<br>
IEEE 802.16e protocol. However, the legacy IEEE 802.16e TDD frame structure<br>
has a relatively long duration and is incapable of achieving the latency targets<br>
set for IEEE 802.16m.<br>
[0003]	Evolutionary wireless communication systems should also<br>
support for legacy system equipment. For example, some IEEE 802.16e and<br>
IEEE 802.16m base stations and mobile stations are likely to coexist within the<br>
same network while upgrading to the newer system. Thus IEEE 802.16e<br>
mobile stations should be compatible with IEEE 802.16m base stations, and<br>
IEEE 802.16e base stations should support IEEE 802.16m mobile stations. Thus<br>
 <br>
frame structures for air-interfaces are proposed with a view to achieving lower<br>
latency and in some embodiments to maintaining backward compatibility.<br>
[0004]	A legacy system is defined as a system compliant with a subset of<br>
the WirelessMAN-OFDMA capabilities specified by IEEE 802.16-2004<br>
(specification IEEE Std 802.16-2004: Part 16: IEEE Standard for Local and<br>
metropolitan area networks: Air Interface for Fixed Broadband Wireless<br>
Access Systems, June 2004) and amended by IEEE 802.16e-2005 (IEEE Std.<br>
802.16e-2005, IEEE Standard for Local and metropolitan area networks, Part<br>
16: Air Interface for Fixed and Mobile Broadband Wireless Access Systems,<br>
Amendment 2: Physical and Medium Access Control Layers for Combined<br>
Fixed and Mobile Operation in Licensed Bands, and IEEE Std. 802.16-<br>
2004/Corl-2005, Corrigendum 1, December 2005 ) and IEEE 802.16Cor2/D3,<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[00024]	In FIG. 1, the wireless communication system 100 includes one or<br>
more fixed base infrastructure units forming a network distributed over a<br>
geographical region. A base unit may also be referred to as an access point,<br>
access terminal, Node-B, eNode-B, or by other terminology used in the art.<br>
The one or more base units 101 and 102 serve a number of remote units 103<br>
and 110 within a serving area, for example, a cell, or within a cell sector. The<br>
remote units may be fixed or terminal. The remote units may also be referred<br>
 <br>
to as subscriber units, mobile stations, users, terminals, subscriber stations,<br>
user equipment (UE), terminals, or by other terminology used in the art.<br>
[00025]	Generally, base units 101 and 102 transmit downlink<br>
communication signals 104 and 105 to serving remote units on at least a<br>
portion of the same resources (time and/or frequency). Remote units 103 and<br>
110 communicate with the one or more base units 101 and 102 via uplink<br>
communication signals 106 and 113. The one or more base units may comprise<br>
one or more transmitters and one or more receivers that serve the remote<br>
units. The remote units may also comprise one or more transmitters and one<br>
or more receivers.<br>
[00026]	In one embodiment, the communication system utilizes OFDMA<br>
or a next generation single-carrier (SC) based FDMA architecture for uplink<br>
transmissions, such as interleaved FDMA (IFDMA), Localized FDMA<br>
(LFDMA), DFT-spread OFDM (DFT-SOFDM) with IFDMA or LFDMA. In<br>
OFDM based systems, the radio resources include OFDM symbols, which may<br>
be divided into slots, which are groupings of sub-carriers. An exemplarv<br>
OFDM based protocol is IEEE 802.16(e).<br>
[00027]	Generally, the wireless communication system may implement<br>
more than one communication technology as is typical of systems upgraded<br>
with newer technology, for example, the evolution of GSM to UMTS and<br>
future UMTS releases thereof. In FIG. 1, for example, one or more of the base<br>
units 101 may be legacy technology base stations, for example, IEEE 802.16(e)<br>
protocol base stations, and other base station may be newer generation<br>
technologies, for example, IEEE 802.16(m) protocol base stations. In these<br>
cases, it is generally desirable for the new technologies to be backward<br>
 <br>
compatible with the legacy technology. For the evolution of IEEE 802.16(e),<br>
the backward compatibility constraint implies that the legacy frame structure,<br>
for example, the 5 msec duration 802.16(e) frame, must be supported by<br>
802.16(m) base stations. Additionally, in order to efficiently support delay<br>
sensitive applications, 802.16(m) base stations should be able to service both<br>
802.16(m) and legacy terminals within the common frame structure.<br>
[00028]	Regarding frame structure, it is generally necessary to design<br>
frames having a relatively short duration in order to reduce latency. Thus to<br>
deliver low latency in 802.16m systems with backward compatibility, it is<br>
necessary to develop a sub-frame structure based on the legacy 802.16(e)<br>
frame. In order to address the latencv requirements, it is necessary to design<br>
frames with shorter than 5msec duration. However, to efficiently serve legacv<br>
traffic, it is also necessary that 802.16(m) systems have 5 msec legacv frames.<br>
Thus two broad classes of frames would be required for an 802.16(m) system<br>
having reduced latency and support for legacy 802.16(e) devices. The first<br>
class includes a full-frame (having a 5 msec duration) with one DL interval<br>
and one UL interval similar to the 802.16(e) TDD legacv frames. The second<br>
class of frames includes a sub-frame. For example, a 5 msec frame having N<br>
DL intervals and N UL intervals. This frame may also contain N<br>
transmit/receive transition gap (TTG) and receive/transmit transition gap<br>
(RTG) intervals. N could be kept small, typically N=2, in order to limit TTG<br>
and RTG related overhead. According to this exemplary scheme, the legacv<br>
802.16(e) TDD frames can only be a full-frame and the 802.16(m) frames are<br>
preferably sub-frame 1:2, although they could also be full-frames. The h-<br>
frames can be either full-frame or sub-frame 1:2. FIG. 2 illustrates an 802.16(m)<br>
sub-frame 1:2 that is backwards compatible with a legacy 802.16(e) TDD frame,<br>
wherein the first and third blocks are downlink blocks and the second and<br>
 <br>
fourth blocks are uplink blocks. In general, the length of the intervals of the<br>
blocks can be different.<br>
[00029] The 802.16(m) 5 msec frame can be perceived to be composed of<br>
following types of basic regions: e-DL region used for transmission of<br>
downlink traffic to 802.16(e) terminals; e-UL: region allocated for transmission<br>
of data and control messages by 802.16(e) terminals; m-DL: region allocated for<br>
transmission to 802.16(m) terminals; and m-UL: region allocated for<br>
transmission by 802.16(m) terminals. The e-DL and e-UL regions can also be<br>
used for transmissions to/from 802.16(m) terminals. In general, the structures<br>
of the 802.16(m) region (sub-channel and pilot structures) can be different from<br>
those of the 802.16(e) regions. Depending on the population of legacy and<br>
newer generation terminals, it may be necessary to allocate the entire 5 msec<br>
frame for 802.16(e) services or 802.16(m) services.<br>
[00030]	Using these different types of regions, various types of 5msec<br>
frame structures can be created to suit the traffic service requirements. These<br>
are: e-frames composed of only e-DL and e-UL regions used to serve legacy<br>
802.16(e) TDD terminals (802.16(m) terminals can also be served in these<br>
frames in legacy mode); m-frames composed of m-DL and m-UL regions only<br>
for serving only 802.16(m) terminals; h-frames containing both e-DL/e-UL and<br>
m-DL/m-UL regions for serving 802.16(e) and 802.16(m) terminals. The<br>
802.16(m) portion and the 802.16(e) portion should be time division<br>
multiplexed so that the 802.16(m) control channel, pilot, and sub-<br>
channelization can provide flexibility.<br>
[00031]	Depending on the device type population and traffic pattern, it<br>
may be necessarv to treat an m-frame or an h-frame as a legacy virtual frame<br>
 <br>
in a cell/sector. The m-DL and m-UL regions in these frames may have<br>
different sub-channel/pilot structures than the legacy systems; those regions<br>
need to be treated as "dead zones", which the legacy terminals should not use.<br>
The full-frame, being similar in structure to the legacy 802.16(e) frame, can be<br>
easily mapped to a legacy virtual frame with full utilization of the frame<br>
resources. However, the sub-frame 1:N, which can also be mapped to legacy<br>
802.16(e) virtual frame, will contain "dead zone(s)" where no 802.16(e) (TDD)<br>
transmission can be allowed to ensure DL/UL synchronization.<br>
[00032]	An 802.16(m) base unit can provide service to legacy 802.16(e)<br>
terminals in full-frames. To provide service in the sub-frame 1:N, the<br>
802.16(m) base unit can map a legacv virtual 5 msec frame to N adjacent sub-<br>
frames and the train of sub-frames can be organized as a train of legacv 5msec<br>
virtual frames. There are N choices for the time division duplex frame (TDD)<br>
split position in a legacy virtual frame. The system wide synchronization<br>
requirement for the TDD system imposes additional constraints on the<br>
downlink and uplink transmission intervals, creating dead zones during<br>
which no transmission should be done to and from legacy 802.16(e) TDD<br>
terminals. However, transmissions to and from 802.16(m) terminals are<br>
possible in these dead zones. FIG. 3 illustrates a first configuration wherein a<br>
legacy 802.16(e) TDD terminal encounters a 5 msec frame having a 75 % duty<br>
cycle. The frame includes a legacv preamble 302, a DL map 304, and a dead<br>
zone 306 during which there is no legacy downlink allocation during the<br>
802.16(m) uplink interval. FIG. 4 illustrates a second configuration wherein<br>
the frame includes a dead zone 406 during which there is no legacy uplink<br>
allocation during the 802.16(m) downlink interval.<br>
 <br>
[00033] A generic message structure and its parameters to indicate a dead<br>
zone is shown in Table 1.<br>
Table 1 Message parameter for dead zone indication<br>
 <br>
[00034]	In the above message, the parameter "location" indicates a<br>
position within the frame in time (which may be denoted by the symbol<br>
number within the frame or absolute time or time offset from the start of the<br>
frame or offset from some other specified time); the interpretation of the<br>
parameter "location" depends on the value of the parameter "dedicated pilot<br>
tag". If "dedicated pilot tag" is 1, the pilot symbols after "location" are<br>
dedicated; it it is 0, it indicates that the pilot symbols after the "location" are<br>
not dedicated pilots. Thus a zone with dedicated pilots can be described by<br>
two occurrences of this message: the first message with dedicated pilot tag=l<br>
and location="T1", followed by a 2nd message with dedicated pilot tag = 0 and<br>
location="T2", where T2&gt;=T1; a legacy terminal which has been allocated<br>
resources within this zone should use only pilots within its burst for channel<br>
estimation. A legacy terminal which has not been allocated resources within<br>
this zone will ignore the pilots in this zone and also it will not need to decode<br>
any of the data transmissions within the dedicated pilot zone. This combined<br>
with the BS not making an allocation to any 16e mobile in the zone indirectly<br>
disables or isolates the 16e mobiles from this zone. Thus, 16e mobile<br>
effectively ignores whatever is in the zone.<br>
 <br>
PAPR_Reduction_and_Safety_Zone_AlIocation_IE() of the IEEE 802.16e<br>
specification. In this message, the parameters "OFDMA_symbol_offset",<br>
"Subchannel offset", "No. OFDMA symbols" and "No. sub-channels"<br>
corresponds to the parameters "starting symbol", "starting sub-channel",<br>
"symbol count" and "sub-channel count" of the generic dead zone message<br>
type 2, respectively; the PAPR_Reduction_Safety_Zone parameter in the<br>
PAPR_Reduction_and_Safety_Zone_AIlocation_IE() should be set to "1" to<br>
indicate a reduced interference zone to the legacy terminal; this will effectively<br>
direct the terminal not to perform anv uplink transmission in that zone.<br>
[00038]	Striking a balance between efficient legacy support and low-<br>
latencv 802.16(m) service is challenging with a homogeneous frame size. The<br>
full-frames discussed above provide efficient legacy support while sacrificing<br>
latency performance for 802.16(m) terminals. The sub-frames provide low-<br>
latency support for 802.16(m) terminals while sacrificing capacity for legacy<br>
terminals in the form of dead zones.<br>
[00039]	In one embodiment, a heterogeneous configuration contains both<br>
full-frames and sub-frames, wherein the full-frames and sub-frames are<br>
interleaved over time. Within a cell, the full-frames are primarily used for<br>
serving legacy terminals present in the cell, whereas the sub-frames are<br>
primarily used to serve the S02.16(m) terminals. However, for servicing<br>
packets with urgent delay constraints, either frame type can be used to service<br>
either type of terminal. The full-frames and the sub-frames are organized in a<br>
repeating pattern, called a super-frame.<br>
[00040]	In the super-frame of FIG. 5, the interleaving pattern consists of<br>
two sub-frames 1:2 followed by one full-frame. This pattern is generally the<br>
 <br>
same over all sector/cells. The first super-frame contains an 802.16(e) TDD<br>
virtual frame configuration with 75% duty cycle and the 2nd super-frame<br>
contains a 802.16(e) TDD virtual frame configuration with 25% duty cycle.<br>
Generally, for the same 802.16(e) TDD virtual frame, the configuration options<br>
can be different for different base stations. One base station may employ the<br>
802.16(e) virtual frame to communicate with a legacy terminal while another<br>
neighboring base station may employ a 16m Sub-frame 1:2 structure to<br>
communicate with a 16m base station without any undesired interference<br>
between uplink and downlink transmissions. The proportion of the different<br>
types of frames and their interleaving pattern in a super-frame is generally<br>
determined by the proportion of 802.16(e) and 802.16(m) terminals in the<br>
svstem. The configurations may be implemented on a system-wide basis to<br>
ensure that there is no conflict between base unit transmission and reception in<br>
adjacent cells (e.g., no conflict in TDD T\/Rx boundaries among adjacent<br>
cells).<br>
[00041] Thus a next generation wireless communication infrastructure<br>
entity, for example, an 802.16(m) base unit in FIG. 1, would transmit a super-<br>
frame including a plurality of frames wherein each frame includes at least two<br>
regions. The regions are generally some sort of resource that may be allocated<br>
to the terminals for uplink or downlink communications in the case of a TDD<br>
system. The super-frames are generally transmitted in a sequence. This<br>
superframe structure must be communicated to all base stations in a TDD<br>
system to maintain synchronization of all sectors and cell in order to ensure<br>
that there is no conflict between base unit transmission and reception in<br>
adjacent cells. This structure may be communicated in a control message<br>
specifying a configuration characteristic of the regions within each frame of a<br>
super-frame. The control message may be transmitted to other base stations<br>
 <br>
over the land line network or by other means such as radio communication<br>
links between the base stations. This control message may also be transmitted<br>
to terminals in at least one frame of the superframe. The message may specify<br>
the configuration characteristic of regions within each frame of the same<br>
super-frame in which the message occurs, or in the frames of another super-<br>
frame, for example a subsequent super-frame. In one embodiment, the<br>
configuration characteristic of the regions within each frame of the super-<br>
frame is specified in a control message map or by other means. In any case, in<br>
some embodiments, the control message may contain a reference number<br>
specifying the map applicable for the super-frame, thereby enabling terminals<br>
to distinguish among versions of the control message containing the<br>
configuration characteristic.<br>
[00042]	In one embodiment, the configuration characteristic of the regions<br>
is selected from a group comprising: a number regions; region size; region<br>
type (e.g., uplink or downlink for a TDD system); and the ordering of the<br>
regions. Multiple characteristics may also be specified. In one embodiment,<br>
for a TDD system, the control message specifies whether the regions of the<br>
frame are uplink regions or downlink regions. Thus the regions are selected<br>
from a group of regions comprising: an uplink region and a downlink region.<br>
The control message may also specify the number of uplink regions or<br>
downlink regions within each frame of a super-frame. In some embodiments,<br>
the control message specifies a size of uplink regions or downlink regions<br>
within each frame of a super-frame. In FIG.5, the frames generally have<br>
different numbers of resource blocks (a resource block is a downlink or uplink<br>
transmission interval). For example, the first and second 5 msec sub-frames<br>
have four resource blocks, and the third 5 msec sub-frame has two blocks.<br>
 <br>
[00043] There are various ways to configure frames that provide legacy<br>
compatibility and reduce latency based on the proposed framework. Another<br>
factor to consider in the design of a new protocol frame structure is support for<br>
both TDD and FDD. Preferably, similar frame and sub-frame structures can be<br>
applied for both TDD and FDD.<br>
[00044]	In one embodiment, a frame is divided into multiple blocks of<br>
equal size, wherein the blocks may support one or more protocols, for<br>
example, IEEE 802.16(e) and/or 802.16(m). Such a frame would enable an<br>
802.16(m) wireless communication infrastructure entity to allocate radio<br>
resources to both 802.16(e) and 802.16(m) wireless terminals. Generally, the<br>
radio frame includes a plurality of blocks, including a first block and last<br>
block, wherein each block comprises a plurality of symbols. In one<br>
embodiment, each block comprises substantially the same number of symbols.<br>
The first block includes a first protocol preamble, for example, a legacy<br>
protocol preamble like 802.16(e). The remaining blocks in the frame are<br>
devoid of the first protocol preamble.<br>
[00045] Generally, the radio frame includes at least one first protocol<br>
block and/or at least one second protocol block, for example, 802.16(e) and/or<br>
802.16(m) blocks. In some embodiment, the frame includes both first and<br>
second protocol blocks. In another embodiment, the frame includes only<br>
second protocol blocks, for example, 802.16(m) blocks. The radio frame<br>
includes an allocation control message for allocating resources within a<br>
protocol block. In frames that include first and second protocol blocks, the<br>
radio frame includes a first protocol allocation control message for allocating<br>
resources in the first protocol block, and a second protocol allocation control<br>
message for allocating resources in the second protocol block. In one<br>
 <br>
embodiment, the allocation control message is a first protocol allocation<br>
control message for allocating resources within a first protocol block of a radio<br>
frame, for example, a subsequent frame, that is different than the radio frame<br>
within which the first protocol allocation control message is located. In one<br>
embodiment, the first allocation control message is located in the first block.<br>
The first block may be a first or second protocol block, for example, an<br>
802.16(e) or 802.16(m) block.<br>
[00046] The sub-blocks may be described based on their position in the<br>
frame and the characteristics of the sub-block. For example, a 5 msec frame<br>
supporting both 802.16(e) and 802.16(m) protocols may be characterized as one<br>
of the region tvpes discussed above. There are five types of 802.16(m) sub-<br>
blocks. Each sub block has a unique characteristic designed to achieve the<br>
backward compatibility goals and efficient 802.16(m) performance. An<br>
802.16(m) DL Lead Sub-Block contains a legacy 802.16(e) pre-amble in the first<br>
symbol. The remaining symbols of the frame may be allocated to 802.16(m).<br>
This sub-block may only be transmitted in the first sub-frame. An 802.16(m)<br>
DL Lead Compatible sub-block also contain a 802.16(e) FCH and 802.16e DL-<br>
MAP in addition to the 16e pre-amble for backward compatibility with legacy<br>
terminals. The remaining symbols are allocated to 802.016(m). The Lead<br>
Compatible sub-block may be transmitted only in the first sub-frame. An<br>
802.16(m) Synchronization Sub-Block contains a broadcast control that may be<br>
used to synchronize an 802.16(m) terminal and describe broader aspects of the<br>
802.16(m) frame. This sub-block occupies a unique position in the 5 ms frame<br>
as a reference for synchronization. The second sub-frame is an appropriate,<br>
but not necessary, position for this synchronization sub-block. An 802.16(m)<br>
DL Sub-Block is a generic 16m sub-block that contains 802.16(m) Downlink<br>
data and 802.16(m) control. This may be occupying the 2nd, 3rd or 4th sub-<br>
 <br>
frames. An 802.16(m) UL Sub-Block is a generic 802.16(m) sub-block contains<br>
802.16(m) Downlink data and 802.16(m) control. This block may occupy the<br>
2nd, 3rd or 4th sub-frame.<br>
[00047]	There are five types of 802.16(e) sub-blocks that may be allocated<br>
in the 802.16(m) frame structure. These sub-blocks conform to the legacy<br>
specification of 802.16(e) frames and cannot be distinguished from legacy<br>
802.16(e) frames by a legacy mobile. A Legacy DL Lead Sub-Block is identical<br>
to legacy frames containing a 802.16(e) pre-amble, 802.16(e) FCH; 802.16(e) DL-<br>
MAP. This sub-block will contain 802.16(e) downlink data and would<br>
typically contain an UL MAP. A legacy DL Secondary Sub-Block is identical to<br>
legacy 802.16(e) numerology and contains 802.16(e) DL data. The Legacy DL<br>
Secondary Sub-Block may only follow a Legacy DL Lead Sub-Block. A Legacy<br>
DL Tertiary Sub-Block block is identical to a legacy 802.16(e) numerology and<br>
contains 802.16(e) DL data. The Legacy DL Tertian- Sub-Block may only<br>
follow a Legacy DL Secondary Sub-Block. A legacy UL Tertiary Sub-Block<br>
contains legacy uplink data and may also contain legacy uplink control. A<br>
legacy UL Tail Sub-Block contains legacy uplink data and may also contain<br>
legacy uplink control.<br>
[00048]	In one implementation, the sub-block type allocated depends on<br>
the frame position. The following sub-blocks may be allocated to the first sub-<br>
frame position: 802.16(m) Lead Sub-Block; 802.16(m) DL Lead Compatible<br>
Sub-Block; and Legacy DL Lead Sub-Block. The following sub-blocks may be<br>
allocated to the second sub-frame position: 802.16(m) Synchronization Sub-<br>
Block; 802.16(m) DL Sub-Block; 802.16(m) UL Sub-Block; and Legacy DL<br>
Secondary Sub-Block. The following sub-blocks may be allocated to the third<br>
sub-frame position: 802.16(m) DL Sub-Block; 802.16(m) UL Sub-Block; Legacy<br>
 <br>
DL Tertiary Sub-Block; and Legacy UL Tertiary Sub-Block. The following sub-<br>
blocks may be allocated to the fourth sub-frame position: 802.16(m) DL Sub-<br>
Block; 802.16(m) UL Sub-Block; and Legacy UL Tail Sub-Block.<br>
[00049]	Using these different types of regions, various types of frame<br>
structures can be created to suit the traffic service requirements also discussed<br>
above. Generally, the first block in the frame is a DL region with the first<br>
symbol allocated for the preamble. The last symbol or the last 2 or 3 symbols<br>
for cells with relativelv large radiuses of the DL block, if the next block is an<br>
UL block, will be allocated for TTG. If the last block is an UL block, then the<br>
last portion of the 5 msec frame is allocated for RTG. For additional DL/UL<br>
split, the first symbol of the DL block (following an UL block) is allocated for<br>
RTG.<br>
[00050]	FIG. 6 is an exemplary 802.16(m) frame 600 having equal size sub-<br>
blocks. The frame contains a preamble 602 and an RTG 604. All four blocks<br>
606, 608, 610 and 612 contain either m-DL or m-UL region and it does not<br>
contain any legacy 802.16(e) structure. The first block (sub-frame) in an m-<br>
frame contains an 802.16(m)-DL region. There are several possible TDD splits:<br>
75%, 50%, 25% or 100% (full DL or full UL frame). Both full-frame and Sub-<br>
frame 1:2 formats of m-frames can be constructed. Since the m-frame does not<br>
support 802.16(e) data, the control overhead of this frame may be small<br>
depending on the 802.16(m) control channel design. As man)' as 3 bits ma)' be<br>
required to signal the construction of an 802.16(m) frame. The frame is a 5<br>
msec frame with 12 symbols per frame. In other embodiments, however, the<br>
frame mayu have a longer or shorter duration and each block mav contain some<br>
other number of symbols.<br>
 <br>
[00051] FIG. 7 is a hybrid frame 700, also referred to as a HEM-I frame,<br>
having equal size sub-blocks designed to serve both 802.16(e) and 802.16(m)<br>
data traffic in the same 5 msec interval. The frame contains a preamble 702<br>
and an RTG 704. The first block is an 802.16(e) DL region starting with a 1-<br>
symbol preamble followed by 802.16(e) MAPs 806 and an 802.16(e) DL traffic<br>
resource region 708. The other 3 blocks are a combination of 802.16(e) and<br>
802.16(m) regions (DL or UL). For 802.16(e) terminals, the 802.16(m) sub-<br>
frames are in a separate zone with dedicated pilots. Both full-frame and Sub-<br>
frame 1:2 can be constructed with this type of frame. There are several<br>
constraints in this structure: The 2nd block cannot be an e-UL, because it will<br>
not satisfy the TTD splits allowed in legacy 802.16(e) systems; To construct a<br>
Sub-frame 1:2, the 2nd block must be m-UL. This requires that, the 802.16(m)<br>
MAP either be located in the 1sl block or in the previous 5 msec frame interval.<br>
Frame 700 includes a full size 16e MAP overhead to support 802.16(e) traffic.<br>
However, since part of the frame is allocated for 802.16(m) traffic, the number<br>
of 802.16(e) users in this frame is smaller than a legacy 802.16(e) frame.<br>
Control channel overhead of frame 700 is medium. As many as 5 bits may be<br>
required to signal the construction of a 802.16(m) frame.<br>
[00052]	FIG. 8 is a frame 800, also referred to as a HEM-II frame, having<br>
equal size sub-blocks that supports onlv 802.16(m) data traffic. The frame<br>
contains a preamble 802 and an RTG 804. The symbol is followed bv a<br>
802.16(e) basic MAP 806. The 802.16(e) basic MAP guarantees backward<br>
compatibility and includes only essential MAP IEs such as the mandatory<br>
elements contained in a IEEE 802.16e compressed map. An IEEE 802.16e<br>
compressed map contains the following essential elements: compressed map<br>
indicator, UL-MAP appended, reserved bit, Map message length, PHY<br>
Synchronization Field, DCD Count, Operator ID, Sector ID, No OFDMA<br>
 <br>
symbols, and DL IE count.<br>
[00053]	The size of the 802.16(e) basic MAP is between approximately 2<br>
and approximately 4 OFDM symbols. The rest of the first block contains an<br>
802.16(m)-DL region 808. The last block contains an 802.16(m) UL region and<br>
the other 2 blocks contain 802.16(m) DL or 802.16(m) UL regions. Both full-<br>
frame and Sub-frame 1:2 can be constructed using this configuration. The<br>
control overhead for frame 800 is small since it does not support 802.16(e) data<br>
traffic. As many as 2 bits may be required to signal the construction of frame<br>
800. Even though the frame 700 of FIG. 7 and the frame 800 of FIG. 8 may be<br>
combined into one type of frame, there is a control signaling savings by<br>
separating them.<br>
[00054]	FIG. 9 illustrates the general structure of a super-frame 900<br>
comprising multiple 5 msec frames having fixed duration sub-blocks, wherein<br>
the frames support 802.16(e) or 802.16(m) terminals or a combination thereof.<br>
 <br>
In one embodiment, an 802.16(m) frame structure is based on a 20 msec super-<br>
frame. To reduce control overhead and simplify signaling and detection for<br>
802.16(m) mobiles (avoid blind detection), the first frame 902 of the super<br>
frame is of the type illustrated in FIG. 8 or an m-frame illustrated in FIG. 6.<br>
The 802.16(m) broadcast channel (m-BCH) 904 is located at the end of the 1st<br>
block of the first frame and it can be used to determine the 20 msec phase<br>
when the terminal is initialized. The 802.16(m) frame structure should be<br>
transparent to legacy 802.16(e) terminals. Thus 802.16(e) terminals need not<br>
detect any new control signal. In a hybrid frame, the 802.16(m) region is<br>
allocated a separate zone with dedicated pilots. The control signal in signaling<br>
802.16(m) terminals on the super-frame and frame and sub-frame structure is<br>
based on a hierarchical structure. This signal is part of m-BCH, and<br>
transmitted every 20 ms. The coded BCH can be mapped into x (e.g., x=2)<br>
number of super frames within a 40 ms interval (if x-2). The size of the signal<br>
should be reduced and made reliable since it is broadcast. An exemplary<br>
Super frame structure control signal is illustrated in Table 1.<br>

[00058]	In FIG. 9, the exemplary frame structure above is described for a<br>
TDD 16m system. However, in an alternative embodiment, a similar<br>
frame/sub-frame structure can be applied for FDD S02.16(m). Also, even<br>
there are only four sub-frames within one 5ms frame, there are 16 sub-frames<br>
within one super frame. Since the control signal in Tables 1-4 can allocate<br>
DL/UL and e/m for every sub-frame, the granularity of splitting between<br>
DL/UL and e/m is 1/16, or 6.25%.<br>
[00059]	FIG. 10 illustrates an exemplary hybrid frame structure that<br>
supports 802.16(e) and 802.16(m). As discussed, the 5 msec frame begins with<br>
a 802.16(e) preamble. The 802.16(e) terminals determine the 802.16(e) and<br>
802.16(m) allocations from the 802.16(e) MAP in which the 802.16(m) region is<br>
allocated as a separate zone. The 802.16(m) region is composed of one or more<br>
m sub-frames, which are of fixed size and located in-between the 802.16(e) DL<br>
and 802.16(e) UL regions. This scheme is similar as HEM-I, except that the sub-<br>
frame sizes are different, DL/UL is split, and e/m is fixed. FIG. 10 illustrates<br>
an exemplary structure. The duration of the m sub-frame can be chosen from<br>
factors of 48 symbols; in this case 16 symbols. The number and size of m sub-<br>
frames in an h-frame structure can be changed based on the load, delay or<br>
other requirements. In this case, 2 m sub-frames are in the hybrid (h) frame.<br>
 <br>
The location of the m sub-frames inside the h-frame can be any place as long as<br>
the TTG is covered by the m-frame region. Complete DL/UL synchronization<br>
and maximum frame utilization can be achieved by careful design of the m<br>
sub-frame relative to the legacy TDD split. A full-frame can be constructed by<br>
using one m sub-frame in the 5 msec frame and a sub-frame 1:2 can be<br>
constructed using 2 m sub-frames. The fixed-sized m sub-frame structure<br>
helps the 802.16(m) terminals to determine the 802.16(m) allocation using blind<br>
detection, although explicit control signaling may be used.<br>
[00060]	In the example above, the allocation of frame resources for legacy<br>
and 802.16(m) traffic and the allocation for DL and UL intervals are in terms<br>
12-symbol blocks. This scheme requires small control overhead, however,<br>
allows only a limited set of legacy and 802.16(m) partitions and a limited set of<br>
TDD splits. In this section an alternative scheme is described which allows<br>
flexible allocation of legacv and 16m partition sizes as well as allows wider<br>
range of TDD splits enabling more flexibility in adapting to the DL/UL traffic<br>
ratios. In this scheme, there is a super-frame structure comprising one or more<br>
of: legacy 802.16(e) frame, 802.16(m) frame, and/or hybrid frame. In some<br>
embodiments, the length of the super-frame can be any multiple of 5 msec,<br>
thus a hybrid frame of 5ms is an included special case of the super-frame<br>
structure. In other embodiments, the super-frame length could be different<br>
from 5 ms. The 802.16(e) frames are same as the legacy frames. The 802.16(m)<br>
frames are not required to support 802.16(e) services and they need not have<br>
any legacy component. They can have either Full-frame structure or a Sub-<br>
frame 1:N structure consisting of N m sub-frames. The m sub-frame can be<br>
configured to have a possibly wide range of TDD split. In the hybrid frames<br>
that support both 802.16(e) and 802.16(m) terminals within the same 5 msec<br>
 <br>
period, the 5msec interval is partitioned into 802.16(e) and 802.16(m) regions.<br>
Two different types of partitioning are described.<br>
[00061] FIG. 11 illustrates a frame structure with flexibility in the sizes of<br>
resource region partitions, for example, 802.16(e) and 802.16(m) partitions,<br>
suitable for allocation radio resources to wireless communication terminals<br>
compliant with first and second protocols. A 5msec frame may have e-DL, e-<br>
UL, m-DL and m-UL regions. However, there is no constraint in the frame<br>
size (number of symbols) except that the sizes of the 802.16(e) regions are<br>
subject to the constraints imposed by the granularity of the sub-channel types<br>
used in those regions. The downlink radio frame generally comprises a first<br>
protocol resource region and a second protocol resource region. The radio<br>
frame also includes a first protocol allocation control message for allocating<br>
resources within the first protocol resource region, and a second protocol<br>
allocation control message for allocating resources within the second protocol<br>
resource region. In some embodiments, the first protocol allocation control<br>
message can allocate resources within the first protocol resource region to<br>
wireless terminal(s) compliant with the first protocol, and the second protocol<br>
allocation control message can allocate resources within the second protocol<br>
resource region to wireless terminal(s) compliant with the second protocol.<br>
[00062]	A wireless communication infrastructure entity, for example, an<br>
802.16(m) base station generally transmits a sequence of radio frames, for<br>
example, for allocating radio resources to wireless terminals compliant with a<br>
first protocol and wireless terminals compliant with a second protocol. In one<br>
embodiment, at least fifty percent (50 %) of the radio frames in the sequence<br>
include a first protocol preamble, for example, an 802.16(e) preamble, in order<br>
to facilitate any 802.16(e) mobile units ability to maintain synchronization to<br>
 <br>
the system. In this embodiment, a radio frame that includes a first protocol<br>
preamble may or may not also contain a first protocol allocation control<br>
message.<br>
[00063] The second protocol, for example, 802.16(m), allocation control<br>
message may be located in a predetermined location within the radio frame.<br>
By locating the second protocol allocation message in a known or<br>
predetermined location, the complexity of an 802.16(m) mobile station can be<br>
reduced, since it may be able to avoid attempting to blindlv detect the location<br>
of the message. Blind detection typically involves attempting to decode a<br>
message over multiple resource sets until a proper message cyclic redundancy<br>
check (CRC) is obtained. The first protocol resource region generally includes<br>
pilot sub-carriers. In one embodiment, the radio frame includes a message<br>
indicating that first protocol terminals should not use pilot sub-carriers in the<br>
second protocol resource region (e.g., by a messaging indicating a dedicated<br>
pilot zone with an absence of allocations to the first protocol terminals within<br>
the dedicated pilot zone, or by a message indicating a safety zone, or other<br>
means). Sub-carriers in second region may not exist or may be in a different<br>
location than pilots in the first region. In another embodiment, the message<br>
identifies a dedicated pilot interval that includes the second protocol resource<br>
region. The radio frame may also include a message identifying a boundary of<br>
the first protocol resource region (e.g., by a messaging indicating a dedicated<br>
pilot zone with an absence of allocations to the first protocol terminals within<br>
the dedicated pilot zone, or by a message indicating a safety zone, or other<br>
means).<br>
[00064]	In FIG. 11, the first symbol of the frame contains either a 802.16(m)<br>
MAP or a subset of a 802.16(m) MAP or an 802.16(m) MAP pointer that<br>
 <br>
identifies the 802.16(m) region independently of the 802.16(e) MAP. This is<br>
followed by a one-symbol 802.16(e) preamble and the 802.16(e) MAP. The<br>
802.16(e) MAP uses safety zones or dedicated pilot zones to indicate the 16m<br>
regions. It is possible to define a new pilot/subchannel/control structure in<br>
the 802.16(m) zones, which is more efficient than the 802.16(e) structures. In<br>
this example, the 802.16(e) DL and UL regions are shown to use PUSC zones.<br>
However, other 802.16(e) permutations can also be used alternatively. Also, in<br>
the 802.16(m) downlink and uplink zones (second protocol regions on<br>
downlink and uplink) the permutations, pilot patterns and pilot density, and<br>
other parameters such as subcarrier spacing or cyclic prefix length or symbol<br>
duration, may be the same as or different from those defined in 802.16(e). In<br>
other embodiments, the first symbol of the frame contains the 802.16(e)<br>
preamble and the 802.16(m) MAP or control channel/control signaling<br>
mentioned above is in a different position or positions in the frame. For<br>
example: within the portion of the frame labeled as 16m DL (e.g., dedicated<br>
pilot zone or safety/PAPR reduction zone from the 802.16(e) perspective).<br>
Generally, the 802.16(m) MAP does not need to be time multiplexed, but can<br>
be multiplexed using any of or anv combination of time division multiplexing<br>
(TDM), frequency division multiplexing (FDM), or code division multiplexing<br>
(CDM). Also, the 802.16(m) MAP and its information can be either broadcast<br>
(e.g., intended to be decodable by nearly all of the 802.16(m) mobiles presently<br>
within the cell coverage area), dedicated (e.g., intended to be decodable only<br>
by a particular mobile or group of mobiles), or some combination of broadcast<br>
and dedicated (e.g., part of the control/signaling information is broadcast, and<br>
mobile-specific control/signaling is dedicated).<br>
[00065]	Also in FIG. 11 (among others), a 16m safety override indicator is<br>
shown within the 802.16(e) MAP/control channel structure. This is an<br>
 <br>
optional aspect that can be included in order to allow an 802.16(m) mobile to<br>
identify that a particular 802.16(e) safety zone or dedicated pilot zone is being<br>
used as an 802.16(m) zone for 802.16(m) mobiles. This can be utilized in at<br>
least two aspects. First, if an 802.16(m) mobile can decode the 802.16(e)<br>
MAP/control channel structure, it will then know where the 802.16(rn) zone(s)<br>
are located within the frame. Then, if the 802.16(m) MAP is in a known<br>
position within an 802.16(m) zone, the 802.16(m) mobile will know where the<br>
MAP is located to simplify the detection of the MAP. In other words, in this<br>
scenario, a pointer to the position of the 802.16(m) MAP is provided to the<br>
802.16(m) mobile. Second, when the 802.16(m) mobile knows that a particular<br>
safety zone or dedicated pilot zone is to be used as an 802.16(m) zone, the<br>
S02.16(e) MAP can be used to allocate resources for an 802.16(m) mobile in the<br>
802.16(m) zone. This use of the 802.16(e) MAP to allocate resources in an<br>
802.16(m) zone can be done either alone (e.g., when no separate 802.16(m)<br>
MAP is present in the frame) or in addition to resource allocations that may be<br>
made by a separate 802.16(m) MAP. The 16m safety override indicator can be<br>
included in the 802.16(e) MAP in a way that is compatible with the 802.16(e)<br>
protocol. For example, a pre-determined available or reserved downlink<br>
interval usage code indicator (DIUC) or extended DIUC from the 802.16(e)<br>
protocol (e.g., that is not already assigned to a particular 802.16(e) function)<br>
can be used as or serve as the 16m safety override indicator. Such indicators<br>
can be used in the downlink MAP, or uplink MAP (in the uplink MAP, the<br>
equivalent of DIUC is uplink interval usage code or UIUC), or both (note that<br>
the terms DIUC/UIUC will be used genericallv in the description of the<br>
present invention, and these terms also may encompass extended DIUC<br>
/UIUC, extended-2 DIUC/UIUC, and extended DIUC/UIUC-dependent IEs).<br>
In the case of utilizing an available DIUC, the operation of 802.16(e) mobiles<br>
should not be impaired because an 802.16(e) mobile generally knows to ignore<br>
 <br>
any DIUCs or UIUCs that it is not capable of interpreting. Other 802.16(e)<br>
compatible methods are also possible, such as utilizing other reserved codes or<br>
fields in other information elements or IEs) but care must be taken to ensure<br>
that the operation of 802.16(e) mobiles is not impaired. Generally, the safety<br>
zone/dedicated pilot override depicted in the legacy (802.16(e)) MAP region<br>
may be specified either implicitly or explicitly. An example of implicit is to<br>
define a new 16m-only MAP IE (e.g., based on a reserved DIUC/UIUC) that<br>
provides a pointer to the 16m region(s) of the frame, and the pointer would be<br>
set to coincide with e.g., the beginning of the 802.16(e) safety zone or dedicated<br>
pilot zone. Another example is that an IE could assign a 16m mobile to a<br>
resource within the safety/dedicated pilot zone (either using existing 16e MAP<br>
IE or a newly defined 16m MAP IE). An example of an explicit override is a<br>
new IE (e.g., based on a reserved DIUC/UIUC) that instructs 16m mobiles to<br>
ignore the safety/dedicated pilot zone IE. Also note that in some embodiments<br>
the safety zone/dedicated pilot override depicted in the legacy MAP region<br>
may instead be indicated in higher-layer signaling, such as a downlink channel<br>
descriptor (DCD) that is transmitted occasionally rather than ever}- frame,<br>
rather than in the MAP. This will reduce MAP overhead, especially if the<br>
size/placement of the 16 m zones is changed only slowly.<br>
[00066] In FIG. 12, a first 802.16(m) sub-frame (also referred to as a region<br>
or resource region or zone is completely contained in the 802.16(m) region<br>
created by the safetv zone or dedicated pilot zone before the legacy TDD<br>
boundary. The DL and UL Intervals are adjacent. The DL interval of the<br>
second m sub-frame is also located before the legacy TDD boundary.<br>
However, its UL interval is separated from it by 802.16(e) UL regions. The<br>
adjacency of the UL interval of the first m sub-frame to the DL interval of the<br>
second m sub-frame will benefit the link adaptation performance such as in<br>
 <br>
AMC and MIMO beam-forming. However, this adjacency may be detrimental<br>
to fast retransmissions due to a lack of sufficient processing time, which may<br>
have to wait until the DL interval in the next frame.<br>
[00067] In FIG. 13, two 802.16(m) sub-frames are located in the two<br>
802.16(m) regions created by two safety zones or dedicated pilot zones. For<br>
both sub-frames, the UL interval is adjacent to the DL interval. A drawback of<br>
this scheme is the unused resources in the legacy TTG, which is not required<br>
for the 802.16(m) frame structure or for the 802.16(e) legacy virtual frame.<br>
[00068] In FIG. 14, a sub-frame structure is shown in which the 802.16(m)<br>
regions begin at known locations. Thus the 802.16(m) MAP pointer/MAP<br>
subset/MAP in the first symbol (or alternatively embedded or included in the<br>
802.16(e) MAP in an S02.16(e) compatible manner, such as based on utilizing a<br>
reserved DIUC) is not required as in other embodiments, for example, the<br>
structure of FIG. 10. In FIG. 14, the 802.16(m) UL region appears before the<br>
802.16(m) DL region for both 802.16(m) sub-frames. Thus the UL MAP<br>
relevance is preferably for the next 802.16(m) sub-frame. For the first<br>
802.16(m) sub-frame, the UL region is located after the e-DL region, separated<br>
by the TTG interval. Thus the starting location of the 802.16(m) region can be<br>
blindly detected based on the known TTG interval location. The starting<br>
location of the second m sub-frame can be described in the first m sub-frame.<br>
The wide separation of the m-UL interval from the m-DL interval of the<br>
previous m sub-frame may allow faster HARQ feedback resulting in faster<br>
retransmissions and lower packet latency.<br>
[00069] FIG. 15 is an alternative 802.16(m) frame structure wherein the<br>
structure of the 5 msec hybrid frame is broadcasted using the first DL-MAP-<br>
 <br>
IE() of the 802.16(e) DL-MAP after the FCH, i.e., 4 slots. These IE()s are<br>
discarded by 802.16(e) terminals. Multiple such IE()s can be used to achieve<br>
higher repetition factors and thereby achieve high reliability/coverage. With<br>
this structure, efficient detection of 802.16(m) control can be possible<br>
independent of the 802.16(e) MAP and efficient micro-sleep can be<br>
implemented in 802.16(m) terminals. The main advantage of this structure is<br>
that an entire symbol need not be allocated for the 802.16(m) MAP<br>
pointer/MAP subset/MAP. The usual DL/UL order in the m sub-frame can<br>
be maintained. In the above frame structures, either of the 802.16(e) DL and<br>
UL regions can be reduced to zero, thereby allocating the entire frame for<br>
802.16(m) traffic. An 802.16(m) frame, which is not backward-compatible, can<br>
also be constructed by eliminating the 802.16(e) DL and UL regions as well as<br>
the 802.16(e) MAPs. Another method for including the 802.16(m) frame<br>
structure information in the 802.16(e) MAP is to utilize a predetermined one of<br>
the reserved DIUC/LTUC of 802.16(e) to indicate that the information in a<br>
particular IE is frame descriptive information. As an example, in the DL-MAP-<br>
IE() structure, the Extented-2 DIUC dependent IE() (which corresponds to the<br>
DIUC value 14) can be used; in this Extended-2 DIUC dependent IE()<br>
structure a reserved value of Extended-2 DIUC in the range 0x0B-0x0D or<br>
0x0F can be used to describe the 802.16m frame structure; the length parameter<br>
in this IE will be set to the size of the frame structure in bytes. Alternatively,<br>
the HARQ-DL-MAP-IE() can be used (using the Extended-2 DIUC dependent<br>
IE() with Extended-2 DIUC value 0x07); this HARQ-DL-MAP-IE() structure<br>
with "Mode" parameter set to a value in the range 0b0111-0b1111 (which are<br>
reserved and not used for 802.16(e) structures). Another structure that can<br>
also be used is the DL-MAP-IE() with DIUC=15 which identifies an Extended<br>
DIUC dependent IE() structure; using a reserved value for the Extended DIUC<br>
 <br>
parameter in the range 0x09-0x0A or 0x0C-0x0E an 802.16(m) frame structure<br>
description can be constructed.<br>
[00070] FIG. 16 illustrates a frame structure with flexibility in the sizes of<br>
the resource region partitions, for example, 802.16(e) and 802.16(m) partitions,<br>
suitable for allocation radio resources to wireless communication terminals<br>
compliant with first and second protocols (e.g., 802.16(e) and 802.16(m)). In<br>
one embodiment, at least fifty percent (50 %) of the radio frames in the<br>
sequence include a first protocol, for example, an 802.16(e) protocol, preamble.<br>
The sequence includes a first protocol resource region and a second protocol<br>
resource region, wherein a first protocol allocation control message allocates<br>
resources within the first protocol resource region and a second protocol<br>
allocation control message allocates resources within the second protocol<br>
resource region.<br>
[00071]	In FIG. 17, the control messages in common frame n describe the<br>
allocation in frame n+1 for both the first and second protocols, for example,<br>
802.16(e) and 802.16(m) protocols. FIG. 17 also illustrates the first and second<br>
resource regions in the common frame n+1 being described by control<br>
messages in a preceding frame n. In one implementation, the first and second<br>
protocol allocation control messages occur in a common frame, wherein the<br>
first protocol allocation control message allocates resources within a first<br>
protocol resource region in a frame subsequent to the common frame and the<br>
second protocol allocation control message allocates resources within a second<br>
protocol resource region in a frame subsequent to the common frame. In<br>
another embodiment, the first and second protocol resource regions occur in a<br>
common frame, wherein the first protocol allocation control message occurs in<br>
 <br>
a frame preceding the common frame, and the second protocol allocation<br>
control message occurs in a frame preceding the common frame.<br>
[00072] FIG. 18 illustrates control messages for the first and second<br>
protocols in common frame n. Part of the first protocol control message<br>
allocates resources in the first protocol region of frame n+1 and the second<br>
protocol control message allocates resources in the second protocol region of<br>
the same frame n.<br>
[00073]	In some embodiments of the invention, the first protocol<br>
allocation control message (e.g., 802.16(e) MAP) can allocate resources within<br>
the first protocol resource region (e.g., 802.16(e) region or zone) to a wireless<br>
terminal compliant with both the first protocol and the second protocol (e.g.,<br>
an 802.16(m) terminal). In this case, the 802.16(m) terminal assigned/allocated<br>
resources within the 802.16(e) region may be required to receive and/or<br>
transmit using the 802.16(e) protocol. Assigning/allocating resources to an<br>
802.16(m) mobile within an 802.16(e) region in this manner can be<br>
advantageous for load balancing purposes - for example, there may be times<br>
when the 802.16(m) region may become fully allocated/utilized while the<br>
802.16(e) region is not fully utilized. This can occur dynamically based on<br>
traffic patterns and scheduling policies. In such a case, some of the 802.16(m)<br>
terminals can be assigned resources in the 802.16(e) region in order to<br>
accommodate a higher total amount of traffic for 802.16(m) terminals.<br>
