				<td>Method for producing an arc-erosion resistant coating and corresponding shield for vacuum interrupter<br>
chambers<br>
The invention relates to a method for producing an arc-erosion resistant coating, in particular for inner regions of shields that are exposed to electric arcs, and to a shield produced in this way for vacuum interrupter chambers, according to the precharacterizing clauses of patent claims 1 and 6.<br>
In particular in inner regions of switching devices that are exposed to electric arcs, for example so-called vacuum interrupter chambers, arranged inside which are contact pieces which pull apart the closed switching contacts in a permanent vacuum by means of a mechanism acting from the outside, possibly on the basis of an appropriate displacement-time curve, internal components undergo strong thermal and plasma-related stress.<br>
Such vacuum interrupter chambers are used in low-voltage, medium-voltage and high-voltage switchgear. Electric arcs that are created between contact pieces in a vacuum atmosphere, in particular under short-circuit current conditions during switching off (separation of the contact pieces), are extinguished the next time the current passes through zero, or at the latest the next-but-one time it passes through zero. However, they act on the inner regions of the vacuum interrupter chamber only for milliseconds and, as is known, high energy densities thereby occur, even if only for a brief time. This means that there is quite a significant load on at least some of the components of a vacuum interrupter chamber in the case of a compact design of a vacuum chamber, and so the service life of such a vacuum chamber is substantially<br>
 <br>
limited by the number of switching operations that are performed in the case of a short-circuit.<br>
For this reason, some of the vacuum interrupter chambers are equipped with an arc-erosion resistant shield, which is positioned between the surrounding area of the contact pieces and the inner wall of the interrupter chamber (for example the ceramic insulator).<br>
Since the shields are thin-walled, cylindrical, partly contoured, sheet-metal parts, their plasma erosion is particularly high under the heat correspondingly produced.<br>
Furthermore, sintering methods for producing copper-chromium shields by means of a powder sintering process are known from the prior art. For this purpose, pressing tools for producing the green compacts are required for the different diameters. The production of a compact material subsequently takes place by sintering the green compacts at temperatures of around 1000 degrees Celsius under a vacuum or an inert-gas atmosphere.<br>
Furthermore, the plasma spraying method is known as an example of a thermal spraying method. The thermal method is used for applying a copper-chromium layer. Plasma spraying is carried out in a known way on the basis of the strong getter effect of the chromium in an inert-gas atmosphere. An increased gas content in the sprayed-on layer is unavoidable however, and is disadvantageous.<br>
Furthermore, so-called MLC methods are known, used for producing a sheet form for vacuum interrupter chamber shields or vacuum interrupter chambers, according to DE 19747242 C2.<br>
 <br>
The use of a copper-chromium shield provides a broader scope for the structural design of a compact vacuum interrupter chamber. However, this entails higher costs of the vacuum interrupter chamber. This disadvantage can be partly reduced by integration of the shield and arc-erosion resistant layer. Nevertheless, the arc-erosion resistance is limited and at the same time the methods referred to are relatively complex. Moreover, certain material compositions, that is to say the variation of the stoichiometric element, are also much more difficult here.<br>
The invention is therefore based on the object of providing a method for producing arc-erosion resistant shields which on the one hand can be produced more easily, but on the other hand have an extremely high arc-erosion resistance.<br>
The set object is achieved according to the invention in the case of a method of the generic type by the characterizing features of patent claim 1.<br>
Further advantageous refinements of the method according to the invention are represented in the dependent patent claims 2 to 9. With regard to the use of a vacuum interrupter chamber, the set object is achieved by such an arc-erosion resistant shield made by the method as claimed in one of claims 1 to 9 being used inside said chamber.<br>
The essential aspect 'here of the production method according to the invention is that a substrate material is coated with an arc-erosion resistant alloy and/or a composite material by the cold-gas spraying method. It has been found here that an extremely arc-erosion resistant layer can be used on a substrate or on shields, including for use in applications with high erosive and thermal loading, such as in vacuum<br>
 <br>
interrupter chambers, by the cold-gas spraying method, which is easy to accomplish.<br>
The starting powder mixture of copper and chromium is then used in the known cold-gas spraying method in such a way that shields for the inner coating of substrates or shields in vacuum interrupter chambers are thereby coated at least in the regions that are exposed to plasma and thermal erosion.  The chromium concentration can be set over a wide range for this purpose, which allows said process technique of cold-gas spraying. The shield,  which may a priori be formed with thin walls, is preferably coated with a layer of &gt; 0 - 2 mm. This  produces  a very dense  layer with a  low gas content.   The layer may in this case be sprayed onto the component under an air or inert-gas atmosphere.  In the case of thermal spraying, the gas content of the finished layer is much higher due to the strong getter effect of the chromium.  This clearly sets the cold-gas spraying method apart from the known plasma or flame spraying.<br>
This applies both to gases which chemically react with the two powders and to gas incorporated in the layer, so-called included gas. The latter can be easily removed from the layer during a heat treatment (soldering) of a vacuum interrupter chamber under a vacuum atmosphere by desorption.<br>
In a further advantageous refinement, it is specified that, in the case of the copper-chromium mixture used, the chromium component can be adjusted between 0 and 100 percent by weight.<br>
Such a possibility only exists in this simple way with the aid of the specified technology used here.<br>
 <br>
In a further advantageous refinement, it is specified that  the  powder  has  a  grain  size  of  between approximately 0 and 150 micrometers.   In this range, optimum results are achieved.<br>
In a further advantageous refinement, it	is	specified<br>
that, apart from copper, materials such	as	tungsten,<br>
molybdenum, platinum, zirconium, yttrium	or	palladium<br>
can also be used.<br>
In a further advantageous refinement, it is specified that, after coating, the layer produced in this way can be reduced under hydrogen or degassed by annealing under a high-vacuum atmosphere.<br>
The invention is represented in the drawing in the case of one application and is described below.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment according to Figure 1, a section through the vacuum interrupter chamber is represented. At the height of the two contact pieces and also with allowance for the switching stroke (displacement), the arc-erosion resistant shield 10 is therefore arranged in this region inside the vacuum interrupter chamber. The shield is in this case designed like a tapering piece of tube, which is to be positioned at the appropriate location inside the vacuum interrupter chamber. In this exemplary embodiment, only a partial region of the tube portion (the shield) is coated with an arc-erosion resistant coating 20 on the inner face or the inner surface of the shield 10, in the region that is subjected to thermal loading by the arc plasma. The shield 10 may in this case be produced both from materials such as high-grade steel and from copper. What is important is the property of the coating that provides the arc-erosion resistance.<br>
 <br>
However, with the use according to the invention of the cold-gas spraying method for components of this type, it is also conceivable that other metallic or even ceramic materials may be coated with an arc-erosion resistant layer.<br>
<br>
