BELT TENSiONER AND METHOD FOR MAKING A BELT-TENSIONER ARM AND A SPRING CASE<br>
Technical Field<br>
The  present invention  relates generally to tensioning devices, and more particularly to a belt tensioner and to a method for making a belt-tensioner arm and a spring case. Background Art<br>
The automotive industry utilizes belt tensioners to create a generally constant tension on a belt as it changes in length due to normal wear, or due to changes in span lengths due to span speed differences, wherein the belt is driven by a single drive pulley from the output shaft of the engine and wherein the belt rotates driven pulleys, each operating an automotive accessory. In known designs, the belt tensioner includes either a flat-wound spring or a helical spring, a spring casing, and an arm. One end of the spring is attached to the^ spring casing and the other end of the spring is attached to the arm. The arm pivots with respect to the spring casing when the spring exerts torque. The spring casing is attached to the engine, and an idler pulley is attached to the arm. The spring is preloaded by twisting the arm relative to the spring casing. The idler pulley on the arm is then placed against the belt. As the belt span lengthens, the torque from the preloaded spring continues to cause the idler pulley of the arm to apply pressure against the belt keeping the belt in tension.<br>
In one known arrangement patented as U.S. 5,772,549, a helical spring has a first end screwed into a first screw-like passage of the arm of the spring tensioner and has a second end screwed into a second screw-like passage of the spring casing. The spring is under tension and holds the parts together while permitting the arm to rotate, relative to the spring casing. A cone-shaped bushing is disposed inside the spring between a portion of the arm and a portion of the<br><br>
spring casing to facilitate the rotation of the arm relative to the spring casing. This arrangement is open to contamination and the spring configuration creates a moment loading.<br>
In one known example of a belt tensioner, a square-shaped hole in the idler pulley is engaged by a square head, often as would be common to a 1.27cm V2 or 0.95 cm 3/a" leveraging or ratchet or similar wrench, to lift (preload) the arm. In a different known example, the idler pulley is mounted on a post of the arm, wherein the post has an annular rim which is deformed radially outwardly and over the bearing of the idler pulley creating a radial rivet joint to retain the idler pulley to the arm.<br>
In one known method, the arm is cast using a mold having first and second sections, and the spring case is cast using a mold having first and second segments. In this method, a path in the belt tensioner from the arm's seat for the bearing of the idler pulley to the engine mounting surface of the spring case crosses a line on the spring case corresponding to the parting line of the first and second segments.<br>
Still, engineers continue to seek improved belt tensioners. Disclosure of the Invention<br>
A first expression of an embodiment of the invention is for a belt tensioner including a belt-tensioner helical spring, a belt-tensioner arm, and a belt-tensioner spring case. The helical spring has inwardly projecting first and second end portions. The arm is adapted to support an idler pulley and has a first hook portion, wherein the first end portion of the helical spring is retained by the first hook portion of the arm. The spring case has a second hook portion, wherein the second end portion of the helical spring is retained by the second hook portion of the spring case.<br>
A second expression of an embodiment of the invention<br><br>
is for a belt tensioner including a belt-tensioner spring, a belt-tensioner arm, a belt-tensioner spring case, and a pivot bushing. The spring has first and second end portions. The arm is in contact with the first end portion of the spring and is adapted to support an idler pulley. The spring case is in contact with the second end portion of the spring. The pivot bushing circumferentially surrounds the spring, has a substantially outwardly or inwardly flared cone portion, and has a substantially constant diameter cylinder portion.<br>
A third expression of an embodiment of the invention is for a belt tensioner including an idler pulley and a belt-tensioner arm. The idler pulley has a bearing including a mounting hole having a longitudinal axis. The arm includes a post, wherein the post is positioned in the mounting hole of the bearing of the idler pulley and extends longitudinally or axially beyond the bearing. The post has an annular rim deformed radially outwardly and over the bearing of the idler pulley creating a radial rivet joint. The post has a non-circular hole portion located longitudinally below the annular rim and adapted for engagement by a belt-tensioner arm-lifting tool.<br>
A method of the invention is for manufacturing an arm and a spring case of a belt tensioner, wherein the arm has a bearing seat adapted to support a bearing of an idler pulley and has an arm-to-bushing mounting surface adapted to support a pivot-bushing and wherein the spring case includes an ear having a belt-tensioner mounting surface. The method includes several steps. One step includes obtaining a belt-tensioner-arm casting mold including a first section and a second section, wherein the first section has a first surface portion for casting the bearing seat and a second surface portion for casting the arm-to-bushing mounting surface. Another step includes positioning the first and second sections together along a parting line. Another step includes casting the arm using the disposed<br><br>
first and second sections. Another step includes obtaining a belt-tensioner-spring-case casting mold including a first segment and a second segment, wherein the first segment includes a surface portion for casting the belt-tensioner mounting surface of the ear. Another step includes positioning the first and second sections together along a parting line. Another step includes casting the spring case using the. disposed first and second segments, wherein a path in the belt tensioner from the bearing seat to the belt-tensioner mounting surface does not cross a line on the arm corresponding to the parting line of the first and second sections and does not cross a line on the spring case corresponding to the parting line of the first and second segments.<br>
Several benefits and advantages are derived from one or more  of the  expressions  of an  embodiment  and  method  of the invention. Having inwardly projecting first and second end portions of a belt-tensioner helical spring avoids out-of-plane loads or couples from assembly forces.   A pivot bushing with a substantially outwardly or inwardly flared cone portion and a substantially constant diameter cylinder portion delivers improved offset control (via the cone portion) and alignment guidance (via the cylinder portion).    Having a belt-, tensioner arm including a post having an annular rim and having a non-circular hole portion below the annular rim enables a radial rivet joint to secure an idler pulley to the post and enables access to the non-circular hole portion of the post by a belt-tensioner arm-lifting tool to lift the arm for placing it against a belt creating tension in the belt. Having a path in the belt tensioner from the bearing seat to the belt-tensioner mounting   surface   which   does   not   cross   a   line   on   the   arm corresponding to the parting line of the first and second sections and which does not cross a line on the spring case corresponding to the parting line of the first and second segments minimizes the casting effect on offset and alignment as can be appreciated by those skilled in<br><br>
the art.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
The features of the invention, and its technical advantages, can be seen from the following description of the preferred embodiments together with the claims and the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 is an exploded view of an embodiment of the belt tensioner of the invention including an idler pulley;<br>
Figure 2 is a planar view of the assembled belt tensioner of Figure 1 in a direction looking down on the idler pulley; and<br>
Figure 3 is a cross-sectional view of the assembled belt tensioner of Figure 2 taken along lines 3-3 of Figure 2. Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments<br>
Referring now to the drawings, Figures 1-3 illustrate an embodiment of the present invention. A first expression of the-embodiment shown in Figures 1-3 is for a belt tensioner 10 including a belt-tensioner helical spring 12f a belt-tensioner arm 14, and a belt-tensioner spring case 16. The belt-tensioner helical spring 12 has inwardly projecting first and second end portions. Only the first end portion 18 of the helical spring 12 is shown in the figures with the understanding that, in one example, the second end portion is substantially identical to the first end portion 18. The belt-tensioner arm 14 is adapted to support an idler pulley 20 and has a first hook portion 22. The first end portion 18 of the helical spring 12 is retained by the first hook portion 22 of the arm 14. The belt-tensioner spring case 16 has a second hook portion, Only the first hook portion 22 of the arm 14 is shown in the figures with the understanding that, in one example, the second hook portion of the spring case 16 functions substantially identically to the first hook portion 22 of the arm 14. The second end portion of the helical spring 12 is retained by the second<br><br>
hook portion of the spring case 16. It is noted that the inward spring tang (i.e. end portion) orientation automatically creates a zero-moment spring force as can be appreciated by the artisan.<br>
In one implementation of the first expression of the embodiment of Figures 1-3, the first 18 and second end portions of the helical spring 12 each project substantially radially inwardly. In one variation, the helical spring 12 is coiled about a longitudinal axis 23 defining an inner spring diameter and the tip of the first end portion 18 of the helical spring 12 is disposed closer to the longitudinal axis 23 than to the inner diameter of the helical spring 12.<br>
In one example of the embodiment of Figures 1-3, the helical spring 12 is in tension. It is noted that a controlled axial stretch of the helical spring 12 sustains force on, in one example, an alignment-controlling pivot bushing (to be described later) with the spring tension applying a continued force to the pivot bushing, for sustained damping and alignment control, even as the pivot bushing wears thinner throughout the duty cycle. In one application of the first expression of the embodiment of Figures 1-3, the helical spring 12 is rotationally pulled upon windup. This will cause the helical spring 12 to elongate upon windup and thus decrease the contact pressure and wear on, in one example, the pivot bushing. In one variation this is optimized for improved product function. In a different application (and mirrored coil and hook construction) of the first expression of the embodiment of Figures 1-3, the helical spring 12 is rotationally pushed upon windup. This will cause increased axial force to be placed upon, in one example, the pivot bushing enabling a level of positionally-asymmetrical damping as can be appreciated by the artisan. In one variation of either or both applications, the helical spring 12 is a roundwire spring.<br>
In   one   enablement   of   the   first   expression   of   the<br><br>
embodiment of Figures 1-3, the belt tensioner 10 also includes a pivot bushing 24 disposed between, and in contact with, the arm 14 and the spring case 16 and circumferentially surrounding the helical spring 12. In one variation, the helical spring 12 is in tension, the spring case 16 includes a protrusion 58 having a blocking surface, the arm 14 includes a locking portion 60 having a blocking surface 64, at least one of the locking portion 60 and the protrusion 58 has a leading inclined surface (or ramp) 62, and wherein self unwinding of the helical spring 12 and disassembly of the belt tensioner 10 is prevented by engagement of the blocking surface of the protrusion 58 with the blocking surface 64 of the locking portion 60. This variation enables a single motion, self-locking method of assembly of the belt tensioner 10 as can be appreciated by those skilled in the art. In one example, the substantially consistent spring positioning from the self-locking method eliminates play of the spring and its effect on torque variation.<br>
In one modification, the pivot bushing 24 includes a substantially outwardly or inwardly flared cone portion 26 and a substantially constant diameter cylinder portion 28. In one configuration, the cone portion 26 is disposed closer to the first end portion 18 of the helical spring 12 than is the cylinder portion 28. In another configuration, not shown, the cone portion is disposed closer to the second end portion of the spring than is the cylinder portion. In one application, the cone portion 26 and the cylinder portion 28 are disposed radially between, and in contact with, the arm 14 and the spring case 16, the construction of which permits one to optimize for wear vs. load. The horizontal portion of cone 26 serves to minimize offset change with increased area, and the vertical portion of cone 26 works in conjunction with the cylinder portion 28 serving for alignment guidance as can be appreciated by those skilled in the art.<br>
In one illustration, the belt tensioner 10 also includes an<br><br>
idler pulley 20 supported by the arm 14, wherein the pivot bushing 24 has a centroid (indicated by a dot 30), wherein the idler pulley 20 has a plane of belt loading (indicated by a dashed line 32), and wherein the centroid 30 is disposed proximate the plane of belt loading 32. In one construction, the centroid 30 lies substantially in the plane of belt loading 32. Having the bushing centroid essentially in the plane of belt loading minimizes moment loading.<br>
In one arrangement, the spring case 16 has a case rim 34, and the cone portion 26 of the pivot bushing 24 is disposed proximate the case rim 34. Having the pivot bushing 24 be located in a most radially outward position takes full advantage of available annular wear surface.<br>
One procedure for assembling the belt tensioner 10 of the first expression of the embodiment of Figures 1-3, wherein the helical spring 12 is rotationaily pulled upon windup and the second hook portion of the spring case 16 is ramped, includes steps a) through c). Step a) includes disposing the first end portion 18 of the helical spring 12 in contact with the arm 14.  Step b) includes disposing the second end portion of the helical spring 12 in contact with the spring case 16.-Step c) includes relatively twisting the arm 14 and the spring case 16 trapping the first end portion 18 under the first hook portion 22 of the arm 14 and the second end portion under the second hook portion of the spring case 16 and pulling the helical spring 12 in tension.  In one variation, counter rotation is prevented by a protrusion 58 on the spring case 16 and a locking portion 60 on the arm 14, the locking portion 60 having a leading  inclined surface 62 and a blocking surface 64, wherein the protrusion 58 rides up and over the inclined surface 62 and down the blocking surface 64 of the locking portion 60 during step c), wherein    counter    rotation    is    prevented    by    counter    rotational engagement of the protrusion 58 with the blocking surface 64 of the<br><br>
locking portion 60, and wherein disassembly is accomplished by pulling the spring case 16 and the arm 14 apart a distance to allow the protrusion 58 to clear the blocking surface 64 of the locking portion 60 whereupon counter rotation is enabled. In this variation, there is a self-locking together of the arm 14 and the spring case 16. Self-locking tangs on the arm and spring case make for rapid, robust assembly. Other such variations providing self-locking (including having the protrusion on the arm and/or having the protrusion be inclined) are left to the artisan. In a different variation, fasteners are used to secure together the arm 14 and the spring case 16 after the first 18 and second end portions are longitudinally trapped to prevent counter rotation and disassembly.<br>
A second expression of the embodiment shown in Figures 1-3 is for a belt tensioner 10 including a belt-tensioner spring (e.g., helical spring 12), a belt-tensioner arm 14, a belt-tensioner spring case 16, and a pivot bushing 24. The belt-tensioner spring (e.g., helical spring 12) has first 18 and second end portions. The belt-tensioner arm 14 is in contact with the first end portion 18 of the spring (e.g., helical spring 12) and is adapted to support an idler pulley 20. The belt-tensioner spring case 16 is in contact with the second end portion of the spring (e.g., helical spring 12). The pivot bushing 24 circumferentially surrounds the spring (e.g., helical spring 12), has an outwardly-flared cone portion 26, and has a substantially constant diameter cylinder portion 28.<br>
In one example of the second expression of the embodiment of Figures 1-3, the cone portion 26 is disposed closer to the first end portion 18 of the spring (e.g., helical spring 12) than is the cylinder portion 28. In another example, not shown, the cone portion is disposed closer to the second end portion of the spring than is the cylinder portion.   In one construction, the spring is a helical spring 12.<br><br>
In another construction, not shown, the spring is a flat-wound spring. In one arrangement of the second expression of the embodiment of Figures 1-3, the cone portion 26 is flared outwardly. In another arrangement, not shown, the cone portion is flared inwardly.<br>
In one implementation of the second expression of the embodiment of Figures 1-3, the cone portion 26 and the cylinder portion 28 are disposed radially between, and in contact with, the arm 14 and the spring case 16. In one variation, the belt tensioner 10 also includes an idler pulley 20 supported by the arm 14, wherein the pivot bushing 24 has a centroid 30, wherein the idler pulley 20 has a plane of belt loading 32, and wherein the centroid 30 is disposed proximate the plane of belt loading 32. In one modification, the centroid 30 lies substantially in the plane of belt loading 32 to decrease moment loading.<br>
In one configuration of the second expression of the embodiment of Figures 1-3, the spring case 16 has a case rim 34, and the cone portion 26 is disposed proximate the case rim 34. In one deployment of the second expression of the embodiment of Figures 1-3, the belt tensioner 10 is substantially devoid of any gap between the spring case 16 and the pivot bushing 24 and between the arm 14 and the pivot bushing 24. This location of the pivot bushing 24 enables the pivot bushing 24 to act as a sealing device mitigating contaminant entry into the belt tensioner 10 as can be appreciated by those skilled in the art.<br>
The previously described examples, procedures, etc. of the first expression of the embodiment of Figures 1-3 are equally applicable to the second expression of the embodiment of Figures 1-3.<br>
A third expression of the embodiment of Figures 1-3 is for a belt tensioner 10 including an idler pulley 20 and a belt-tensioner arm 14. The idler pulley 20 has a bearing 36 including a mounting hole 38<br><br>
having a longitudinal axis 40.   The belt-tensioner arm 14 includes a post 42.   The post 42 is disposed in the mounting hole 38 of the bearing 36 of the idler pulley 20 and extends longitudinally or axially beyond the bearing 36.  The post 42 has an annular rim 44 deformed radially outwardly and over the bearing 36 of the idler pulley 20 creating a radial rivet joint. The post 42 has a non-circular hole portion 46 disposed longitudinally below the annular rim 44 and adapted for engagement by a belt-tensioner arm-lifting tool (not shown).   In one arrangement, the non-circular hole portion 46 is a star-shaped orificer and the non-circular head is a star-shaped head (such as a T-50 TORX® head). In other arrangements, not shown, the non-circular hole portion has a multi-lobed shape, a hex-shape, or a slot shape.  In one implementation, the belt-tensioner arm-lifting tool is wrench such as a ratchet or similar wrench.   The annular rim 44 of the post 42 allows assembly of the idler pulley 20 to the post by a radial rivet joint (by simply deforming the annular rim 44 over the bearing 36 of the idler pulley 20) avoiding use of a bolt The non-circular hole portion 46 (e.g., star-shaped orifice) of the post 42 below the annular rim 44 allows lifting (i.e., rotating) of the arm 14-of an assembled belt tensioner 10 (when, for example, the spring case 16 is mounted to an automotive engine) with, for example, a ratchet or similar wrench equipped with a TORX® or hex head. Thus, the post 42 saves space in providing both" the lift-lug geometry to lift the arm 14 and a radial rivet joint to secure the bearing 36 of the idler pulley 20.<br>
The previously described examples, procedures, etc. of the first and/or second expressions of the embodiment of Figures 1-3 are equally applicable to the third expression of the embodiment of Figures 1-3.<br>
A method of the invention is for manufacturing an arm 14 and a spring case 16 of a belt tensioner 10. The arm 14 has a bearing<br><br>
seat 48 adapted to support a bearing 36 of an idler pulley 20 and has an arm-to-bushing mounting surface 50 adapted to support a pivot-bushing 24. The spring case 16 includes an ear (the protruding portion of the spring case 16 having the mounting holes 56) having a belt-tensioner mounting surface (the longitudinally or axially facing surface of the ear seen in Figure 1). The method includes several steps. One" step includes obtaining a belt-tensioner-arm casting mold (not shown) including a first section and a second section, wherein the first section has a first surface portion for casting the bearing seat 48 and a second surface portion for casting the arm-to-bushing mounting surface 50. Another step includes disposing the first and second sections together along a parting line.   Another step includes casting the arm 14 using the  disposed  first  and  second  sections.     Another  step  includes obtaining   a   belt-tensioner-spring-case   casting   mold   (not   shown) including a first segment and a second segment, wherein the first segment includes a surface portion for casting the belt-tensioner mounting surface of the ear.  Another step includes disposing the first and second sections together along a parting line.    Another step includes casting the spring case 16 using the disposed first and second" segments, wherein a path in the belt tensioner 10 from the bearing seat 48 to the belt-tensioner mounting surface does not cross a line on the arm 14 corresponding to the parting line of the first and second sections and does not cross a line on the spring case 16 corresponding to the parting line of the first and second segments.<br>
In one implementation of the method, the arm-casting step uses only the disposed first and second sections (i.e., there are no other mold sections). In the same or a different implementation, the spring-case-casting step uses only the disposed first and second segments (i.e., there are no other mold segments). In the same or a different   implementation,   the   belt tensioner   mounting   surface   is<br><br>
disposable in contact with an engine.<br>
It is noted that having a path in the belt tensioner from the^ bearing seat 48 to the belt-tensioner mounting surface which does not cross a line on the arm 14 corresponding to the parting line of the first and second sections and which does not cross a line on the spring case 16 corresponding to the parting line of the first and second segments minimizes the casting effect on offset and alignment.<br>
In one variation, whether or not a parting line is crossed, having the belt-tensioner mounting surface of the ear of the spring case 16 be on the same segment of the belt-tensioner-spring-case casting mold as the surface of the spring case 16 that touches the pivot bushing 24 reduces the bending moment placed upon the pivot bushing 24 alleviating pinch-related wear and puts all in line with the hub load which minimizes stack-up of the arm/puller assembly offset.<br>
In one design of any one or more or all of the expressions of the embodiment of Figures 1-3, the arm 10 includes a first end cap 52, and the spring case 16 includes a second end cap 54 and includes mounting holes 56 for mounting to, in one example, an automotive or heavy duty combustion engine. Non-automotive applications of the belt tensioner 10 are left to the artisan.<br>
Several benefits and advantages are derived from one or more of the expressions of an: embodiment and method of the invention. Having inwardly projecting first and second end portions of a belt-tensioner helical spring avoids out-of-plane loads or couples from assembly forces. A pivot bushing with a substantially outwardly or inwardly flared cone portion and a substantially constant diameter cylinder portion delivers improved offset control (via the cone portion) and alignment guidance (via the cylinder portion). Having a belt-tensioner arm including a post having an annular rim and having a non-circular hole portion below the annular rim enables a radial rivet joint to<br><br>
secure an idler pulley to the post and enables access to the non-circular hole portion of the post by a belt-tensioner arm-lifting tool to lift the arm for placing it against a belt creating tension in the belt. In one example, having the pivot bushing centroid essentially in the plane of belt loading minimizes moment loading upon the bushing itself. In the same or a different example, locking hooks on the arm and spring case make for rapid, robust assembly with solid engagement that minimizes residual torque creep from tang movement. Having a path in the belt tensioner from the bearing seat to the belt-tensioner mounting surface which does not cross a line on the arm corresponding to the parting line of the first and second sections and which does not cross a line on the spring case corresponding to the parting line of the first and second^ segments minimizes the casting effect on offset and alignment as can be appreciated by those skilled in the art.<br>
