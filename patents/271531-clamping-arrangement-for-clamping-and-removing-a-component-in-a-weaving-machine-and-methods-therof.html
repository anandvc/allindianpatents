The invention relates to a clamping arrangement for clamping a com-<br>
ponent onto a holder in a weaving machine, more particularly to a<br>
clamping arrangement which comprises a clamping element, fittable<br>
into a clamping groove, and screw elements, wherein the clamping<br>
element comprises a first clamping surface and a second clamping sur-<br>
face, placed opposite each other, wherein the holder comprises a<br>
clamping groove which extends in the longitudinal direction of the<br>
clamping arrangement and comprises a first clamping surface and a<br>
second clamping surface, placed opposite each other, wherein the<br>
component comprises a clamping tooth which extends in the longitudi-<br>
nal direction of the clamping arrangement and, when the component is<br>
fitted onto the holder, reaches into the clamping groove, which latter<br>
comprises a first clamping surface that can cooperate with a clamping<br>
surface of the clamping element and further comprises a second<br>
clamping surface that is placed opposite the first clamping surface and<br>
that can cooperate with a clamping surface of the clamping groove,<br>
wherein the screw elements can move the clamping element up to the<br>
component in order to clamp the component onto the holder.<br>
Weaving machines are known in which a number of components are<br>
fastened to a holder and are removed from a holder. Such components<br>
are, for example, a reed, auxiliary blowers or main blowers which are<br>
fitted onto a holder of the sley, or a cloth support or temple, which are<br>
fitted onto a holder of the frame of the weaving machine. A cloth sup-<br>
port and temples are elongated components which are provided in de-<br>
pendence on the chosen cloth to be woven.<br><br>
The direct clamping of components with a bolt joint onto a holder which<br>
is arranged on the frame of the weaving machine is known from, for<br>
example, US 3 800 835. In this embodiment, the load is principally ab-<br>
sorbed by the bolt joint. The clamping arrangement is subject to a large<br>
load during the weaving and can be damaged during the fitting of com-<br>
ponents onto the holder or during their removal.<br>
From EP 395 132, it is known to use a clamping element in the shape<br>
of a dovetail for the removable fitting of an auxiliary blower onto a sley.<br>
This offers the advantage that, if the clamping element becomes worn,<br>
for example as a result of the frequent fitting or removal or as a result of<br>
the large loads to which the clamping element is exposed, the clamping<br>
element can easily be replaced. The dovetail joint also offers larger<br>
clamping surfaces, whereby high pressures are prevented and a better<br>
connection is assured. Moreover, the clamping element can be dis-<br>
placed in the holder in a continuously variable manner in the longitudi-<br>
nal direction, so that an auxiliary blower can be positioned in a manner<br>
which is tailored to the cloth to be woven. Since the clamping element<br>
is located beneath the support of the auxiliary blower, the bolt for<br>
clamping the auxiliary blower onto the sley is screwed into the clamping<br>
element. An auxiliary blower comprises a narrow support and a clamp-<br>
ing element of, for example, two cm length and requires only one bolt.<br>
Elongated components such as a temple or a cloth support require,<br>
however, that a plurality of bolts, distributed over the longitudinal direc-<br>
tion of the component, are fitted into the clamping element. Since the<br>
clamping element needs to be arranged beneath these components, it<br>
is not easy to screw a plurality of bolts into such a clamping element.<br>
It is known from FR 2345610, more particularly as represented in figure<br>
3, to firstly fit the removable clamping element into a holder, then to tilt<br>
the component to be fastened between the clamping element and the<br>
holder, and then to fit the bolts which cooperate with the clamping ele-<br>
ment to fasten the component to the holder. This offers the advantage<br><br>
holder. This offers the advantage that the clamping element remains<br>
held in a well-defined angular position in the positioning slot, whereby<br>
the openings in the clamping element for the reception of the bolts, for<br>
example, remain held in a specific angular position, for example remain<br>
held in a roughly vertical position.<br>
According to one embodiment, the clamping arrangement comprises a<br>
positioning slot which is provided in the clamping groove of the holder<br>
in the longitudinal direction of the clamping arrangement and comprises<br>
at least one surface for guiding the clamping element as the clamping<br>
element is transversely fitted into or removed from the positioning slot.<br>
This offers the advantage that the clamping element can comfortably<br>
be fitted transversely into the positioning slot or transversely removed<br>
from the positioning slot. The clamping element can thereby, in fact, be<br>
freely removed from a frame of the weaving machine, so that the ele-<br>
ments placed to the left or right of the clamping arrangement do not<br>
have to be removed. This is particularly advantageous in a weaving<br>
machine which is already provided with elements to perform a specific<br>
function during weaving.<br>
According to one embodiment, the clamping arrangement comprises a<br>
surface of the positioning slot and a clamping surface of the clamping<br>
groove of the holder for guiding the clamping element as the clamping<br>
element is transversely fitted into or removed from the positioning slot.<br>
This allows the clamping element to be held in a well-defined angular<br>
position while it is fitted into the positioning slot, so that, for example,<br>
the openings in the clamping element for the reception of the screw<br>
elements remain in a specific angular position, for example remain<br>
roughly vertical during the fitting and also after the fitting. The surface<br>
of the positioning slot and the clamping surface of the clamping groove<br>
are arranged roughly parallel or at an angle, for example, so that the<br>
transverse fitting or removal of the clamping element is not hindered.<br><br>
According to a following embodiment, the positioning slot comprises<br>
surfaces which can cooperate with corresponding surfaces of a clamp-<br>
ing element to align a clamping element, arranged in the positioning<br>
slot, with respect to the axis of the screw elements which can be fitted<br>
through openings in the component. This embodiment offers the advan-<br>
tage that the openings in the clamping element are perfectly aligned for<br>
the reception of the screw elements with respect to the screw elements<br>
to be fitted. Particularly where a large number of screw elements are<br>
fitted, this ensures a certain time gain whenever a component is fitted<br>
onto or removed from the holder.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the cross section of the clamping<br>
element is a hexagon. This clamping element is simple to produce,<br>
comprises at the top the trapezium shape suitable for the clamping ef-<br>
fect, comprises two parallel surfaces suitable for guiding the clamping<br>
element as it is fitted into the positioning slot, and comprises at the bot-<br>
tom likewise a trapezium shape suitable for holding the clamping ele-<br>
ment in the positioning slot and for aligning the clamping element in the<br>
positioning slot with respect to the axis of the screw elements to be fit-<br>
ted.<br>
According to one embodiment, a method for clamping a component<br>
onto a holder in a weaving machine, using a clamping arrangement ac-<br>
cording to the invention, is implemented as follows: the clamping ele-<br>
ment is fitted transversely into a positioning slot and then the compo-<br>
nent and the screw elements are fitted, whereupon the screw elements,<br>
through openings in the component, can cooperate with the clamping<br>
element to clamp the component onto the holder. The transverse fitting<br>
of the clamping element onto the holder is particularly advantageous<br>
with respect to the sideways insertion of the clamping element into the<br>
holder if the clamping element has to be fitted onto a weaving machine<br>
which is already provided with elements placed to the left or right of the<br>
clamping arrangement, since the clamping element can then be fitted<br><br>
into the frame of the weaving machine without hindrance by elements<br>
placed alongside the clamping element.<br>
According to one embodiment, a method for removing a component<br>
arranged on a holder in a weaving machine, using a clamping ar-<br>
rangement according to the invention, is implemented as follows: the<br>
screw elements cooperating with the clamping element and the com-<br>
ponent through openings in the component are removed, and then the<br>
clamping element is removed transversely from the positioning slot.<br>
The screw elements are here loosened prior to the removal and are<br>
preferably removed together with the component. The transverse re-<br>
moval of the clamping element from the holder is particularly advanta-<br>
geous with respect to the sideways withdrawal of the clamping element<br>
from the holder if the clamping element has to be removed from a<br>
weaving machine which is already provided with elements placed to the<br>
left or right of the clamping arrangement, since the clamping element<br>
can then be removed from the frame of the weaving machine without<br>
hindrance by elements placed alongside the clamping element.<br>
The invention additionally relates to a weaving machine which makes<br>
use of a clamping arrangement according to the invention and which is<br>
suitable for implementing a method according to the invention.<br>
Further characteristics and advantages of the invention emerge from<br>
the following description of the illustrative embodiments represented in<br>
the drawings and from the subclaims, wherein:<br>

invention;<br>

figure 7 shows a side view of a variant embodiment of a clamping ar-<br>
rangement according to the invention;<br>
figures 8 to 20 show schematically different variant embodiments of a<br>
clamping arrangement according to the invention.<br>
In figure 1, a clamping arrangement 1 according to the invention for<br>
clamping a component 2 for a weaving machine onto a holder 3 is rep-<br>
resented schematically. The holder 3 is in turn fastened to the frame of<br>
a weaving machine. The component 2 as represented in figure 1 con-<br>
cerns a cloth support. Such a cloth support is provided to support the<br>
cloth and comprises, inter alia, profiles 28 and 29. The elongated com-<br>
ponent 2 extends over the width of the weaving machine, that is to say,<br>
for example, over a length of more than two meters.<br>
A perspective view of the embodiment as represented in figures 1 to 5<br>
is represented in figure 2. Here a large number of screwing elements<br>
11, distributed in the longitudinal direction 47 of the component 2, can<br>
clearly be seen. The screw elements 11 are here formed by bolts.<br>
In the state as represented in figures 1 and 3, the component 2 is<br>
clamped in the holder 3 by means of the clamping arrangement 1. The<br>
clamping arrangement 1 comprises a clamping element 8 of hexagonal<br>
cross section with internally threaded openings 23 in which there are<br>
screwed screw elements 11, which, in the represented illustrative em-<br>
bodiment, are fitted roughly vertically through openings 12 in the com-<br>
ponent 2. A number of screw elements 11, distributed in the longitudi-<br>
nal direction 47 of the clamping arrangement 1, are provided, for ex-<br><br>
ample one bolt every ten cm. For a component 2 of more than two me-<br>
ters, this gives rise to a clamping arrangement 1 with more than twenty<br>
screw elements 11. Through the tightening of the screw elements 11,<br>
the clamping element 8, as represented in figure 1, is clamped with the<br>
obliquely arranged clamping surface 9 against the corresponding<br>
clamping surface 5 of the clamping tooth 4 of the component 2 and with<br>
the obliquely arranged clamping surface 10 against the corresponding<br>
clamping surface 6 of the holder 3. As a result, the obliquely arranged<br>
clamping surface 13 of the clamping tooth 4 of the component 2 is<br>
clamped against the corresponding clamping surface 15 of the clamp-<br>
ing groove 14 of the holder 3. The clamping element 8 further com-<br>
prises a surface 7 that is directed toward the component 2. The clamp-<br>
ing tooth 4 of the component 2 forms together with the clamping ele-<br>
ment 8 a wedge of roughly trapezoidal section which is clamped into<br>
the clamping groove 14 of corresponding roughly trapezoidal section<br>
and thus forms a dovetail joint, whereby the, in the represented illustra-<br>
tive embodiment, roughly horizontal fastening surfaces 26, 27 of the<br>
component 2 are clamped onto the corresponding, in the represented<br>
illustrative embodiment, roughly horizontal supporting surfaces 24, 25<br>
of the holder 3. In this way, the component 2 is clamped firmly onto the<br>
holder 3 and can offer resistance to the high load to which this compo-<br>
nent 2 is exposed.<br>
As represented in figures 1 to 5, in the clamping groove 14 of the<br>
holder 3 there is provided a positioning slot 16. According to this illus-<br>
trative embodiment, the positioning slot 16 comprises a roughly trape-<br>
zoidal cross section formed by surfaces 17, 18 and 19, which respec-<br>
tively can cooperate with the lowermost surfaces 20, 21 and 22 of the<br>
hexagonal clamping element 8. Before the fitting or after the removal of<br>
the screw elements 11, as represented in figure 4, the clamping ele-<br>
ment 8 is held in this positioning slot 16 under the influence of gravity.<br>
In this non-clamped state, wherein the clamping element 8 is held in<br>
the positioning slot 16, there is a secure play present between the<br><br>
clamping surface 9 of the clamping element 8 and the clamping surface<br>
5 of the clamping tooth 4 of the component 2. The clamping tooth 4 of<br>
the component 2 can here be fitted into the clamping groove 14of the<br>
holder 3 or removed therefrom not hindered. For the illustrative em-<br>
bodiment represented in figures 1 to 5, this can be done by moving the<br>
clamping tooth 4 of the component 2 roughly in the transverse direction<br>
48 into or out of the clamping groove 14. That is to say roughly parallel<br>
with the obliquely arranged surfaces 5 and 13 of the clamping tooth 4<br>
and with the obliquely arranged surface 9 of the clamping piece 8 and<br>
the obliquely arranged surface 15 of the clamping groove 14.<br>
In the represented illustrative embodiment, the clamping surfaces 5, 13,<br>
9 and 15 respectively are arranged at an angle of roughly 60° with re-<br>
spect to the supporting surfaces 24, 25 of the holder 3, which, in the<br>
represented embodiment, are arranged horizontally. The created play<br>
between the clamping surface 9 of the clamping element 8 and the<br>
clamping surface 5 of the clamping tooth 4 of the component 2, as rep-<br>
resented in figure 4, is also advantageous, however, when the compo-<br>
nent 2 is fitted by sliding the clamping tooth 4 in the longitudinal direc-<br>
tion 47 into the clamping groove 14 of the holder 3. This method cannot<br>
however be used if, as represented in figure 6, on both sides of the<br>
holder 3 elements 106 of the weaving machine are provided, which<br>
prevent the component 2 from being fitted onto the holder 3 in the lon-<br>
gitudinal direction 47.<br>
The hexagonal clamping element 8 of the illustrative embodiment as<br>
represented in figures 1 to 5 rests under the influence of gravity in the<br>
non-clamped state, as represented in figure 4, with the horizontal sur-<br>
face 21 on the horizontal surface 18 formed by the base of the position-<br>
ing slot 16. Moreover, the oblique surfaces 17 and 19 of the positioning<br>
slot 16, which are arranged in accordance with the oblique surfaces 20<br>
and 22 of the clamping element at an angle of roughly 60° with respect<br>
to the horizontal supporting surfaces 24, 25 of the holder, prevent the<br><br>
clamping element 8 from being able to tilt or the clamping element 8<br>
from shifting significantly transversely in the direction of the cloth.<br>
Hence the openings 23 of the clamping element 8 remain, even in the<br>
non-clamped state as represented in figure 4, assuredly arranged in a<br>
roughly angular position. Moreover, in the represented illustrative em-<br>
bodiment, the trapezoidal cross section of the positioning slot 16, which<br>
is roughly consistent with the trapezoidal shape of the bottom half of<br>
the hexagonal cross section of the clamping element 8, ensures that<br>
the clamping element 8, and thus the openings 23 provided therein, are<br>
aligned with respect to the openings 12 in the holder 2 in which the<br>
screw elements 11 are arranged with sufficient play. The clamping<br>
element 8 is not thereby hindered when it is moved, by the screwing on<br>
of the screw elements 11, from a non-clamped state, as represented in<br>
figure 4, to a clamped state, as represented in figures 1 and 3. The<br>
clamping element 8 here continues to maintain its orientation.<br>
The hexagonal clamping element 8 as represented in figures 1 to 5 can<br>
be moved in the transverse direction 49, roughly parallel with the<br>
oblique surface 19 of the positioning slot 16, that is to say at an angle<br>
of roughly 60° with respect to the horizontal supporting surfaces 24, 25<br>
of the holder 3, into or out of the positioning slot 16, before the fitting or<br>
after the removal of the component 2, which latter case is represented<br>
in figure 5. The oblique surface 22 of the clamping element 8 can here<br>
be guided by the corresponding oblique guide surface 19 of the posi-<br>
tioning slot 16, so that the clamping element 8, when fitted into the po-<br>
sitioning slot 16, moves under the influence of gravity obliquely down-<br>
ward until the horizontal surface 21 of the clamping element 8 rests on<br>
the horizontal surface 18 of the positioning slot 16. During this move-<br>
ment, the clamping surface 6 of the clamping groove 14, which is ar-<br>
ranged roughly parallel to the oblique guide surface 19 of the position-<br>
ing slot 16, ensures that the clamping element 8 cannot tilt as it is intro-<br>
duced into the positioning slot 16, since the surface 6 and the guide<br>
surface 19, which are arranged roughly parallel with each other, re-<br><br>
spectively cooperate with the clamping surface 10 and the surface 22,<br>
which clamping surfaces are arranged roughly parallel with each other.<br>
Hence, in the represented illustrative embodiment, the openings 23 in<br>
the clamping element 8 assuredly continue to be arranged roughly ver-<br>
tically, even during fitting into the positioning slot 16. The presence of<br>
the obliquely arranged guide surface 19 is likewise advantageous in the<br>
removal of the elongated clamping element 8 from the positioning slot<br>
16 in the transverse direction 49, since, in the obliquely upward move-<br>
ment, the clamping element 8 is supported and guided by the guide<br>
surface 19.<br>
As represented in figure 1, a second component 32 is arranged onto<br>
the component 2. This second component 32 is, for example, a so-<br>
called temple platform that can be fastened close to a temple (not rep-<br>
resented). Such a component 32 has a length of roughly ten cm up to<br>
fifty cm and is fastened with at least two bolts 31. The second compo-<br>
nent 32 is fastened to the component 2 by means of a known clamping<br>
arrangement 30. The second component 32 is provided with openings<br>
37, in which bolts 31 are fitted which can cooperate with internally<br>
threaded openings 40 in the mounting element 38. Through the tighten-<br>
ing of the bolts 31, the mounting element 38 introduced into the T-<br>
groove 39 is clamped against the horizontal clamping surfaces 35 and<br>
36 of the T-groove 39, whereby the second component 32 is clamped<br>
onto the horizontal supporting surfaces 33, 34 of the component 2. It is<br>
clear that the mounting element 38 can easily be introduced in the lon-<br>
gitudinal direction 47 into the T-groove 39. The horizontal clamping sur-<br>
faces 35, 36 of the known clamping arrangement 30 have a signifi-<br>
cantly smaller surface than the clamping surfaces 6, 15 of the clamping<br>
arrangement 1 according to the invention, whereby the clamping ar-<br>
rangement 1 according to the invention can be exposed to high loads<br>
without risk of high pressures or damage to the clamping surfaces of<br>
the clamping arrangement 1, not even if the clamping arrangement 1 is<br>
fitted and removed frequently. The horizontal arrangement of clamping<br><br>
surfaces 35, 36 of the known clamping arrangement 30 is also less<br>
suited to offering resistance to loads in this horizontal direction. It is<br>
clear that the clamping arrangement 1 according to the invention posi-<br>
tions the component 2 clearly transversely on the holder 3, whilst in the<br>
known clamping arrangement 30 uncertainty exists as regards the<br>
transverse position of the second component 32 on the component 2 in<br>
the clamped state.<br>
In figure 7, a variant embodiment is represented, wherein two clamping<br>
arrangements 1, 78 according to the invention are used. The clamping<br>
arrangement 1 of figure 7 is used for the fastening of a component 79<br>
to a holder 3 and is constructed similarly to the clamping arrangement 1<br>
of figure 1. A second component 80 is likewise fastened with a clamp-<br>
ing arrangement 78 according to the invention to the component 79,<br>
which here additionally acts as the holder. The second component 80<br>
forms the cover of a bar type temple, which comprises a temple bar 65<br>
and, just like the component 79, extends in the longitudinal direction 47<br>
of the holder 3 over roughly the full width of the weaving machine. The<br>
clamping arrangement 78 for clamping the second component 80 com-<br>
prises a clamping element 82 of hexagonal cross section with internally<br>
threaded openings 85 in which there are screwed screw elements 83,<br>
formed by bolts, which are fitted roughly vertically through openings 84<br>
in the second component 80. A number of screw elements 83, distrib-<br>
uted over the length of the clamping arrangement 78, are provided, for<br>
example one screw element or bolt every twenty cm. For a component<br>
80 of more than two meters, this thus gives rise to a clamping ar-<br>
rangement 78 with more than ten screw elements 83. Through the<br>
tightening of the screw elements 83, the clamping element 82, as rep-<br>
resented in figure 7, is clamped with the obliquely arranged clamping<br>
surface 93 against the corresponding clamping surface 92 of the<br>
clamping tooth 87 of the second component 80 and with the obliquely<br>
arranged clamping surface 91 against the corresponding clamping sur-<br>
face 90 of the component 79. As a result, the obliquely arranged clamp-<br><br>
ing surface 88 of the clamping tooth 87 of the second component 80 is<br>
clamped against the corresponding clamping surface 89 of the clamp-<br>
ing groove 86 of the component 79. The clamping tooth 87 of the sec-<br>
ond component 80 forms together with the clamping element 82 a<br>
wedge of roughly trapezoidal cross section, which is clamped into the<br>
clamping groove 87 of corresponding, roughly trapezoidal cross section<br>
and thus forms a dovetail joint, whereby the horizontal fastening sur-<br>
faces 100, 102 of the second component 80 are clamped onto the cor-<br>
responding horizontal supporting surfaces 101, 103 of the component<br>
79. In this way, the second component 80 is firmly clamped onto the<br>
component 79 and can offer resistance to the high load to which this<br>
second component 80 is exposed.<br>
The positioning slot 81 and the associated clamping element 82 for the<br>
fastening of the second component 80 are shaped similarly to the cor-<br>
responding positioning slot 16 and the associated clamping element 8<br>
for the fastening of the component 79. In the non-clamped state, for<br>
example after the removal of the screw elements 83, the surfaces 97,<br>
98 and 99 of the positioning slot 81 cooperate with the correspondingly<br>
arranged surfaces 94, 95 and 96 of the clamping element 82, so that<br>
the clamping tooth 87 can be removed from the clamping groove 86<br>
roughly in the transverse direction 48.<br>
In contrast to the clamping arrangement 1 for the fastening of the com-<br>
ponent 79 to the holder 3, the clamping element 82 cannot be removed<br>
from the clamping groove 86 in the transverse direction 49. Since the<br>
clamping groove 86 is less wide than the clamping groove 14, the<br>
clamping surface 89 of the clamping groove 86 forms an obstacle<br>
hereto. In order to enable the transverse removal and fitting of the<br>
clamping element 82, an obliquely arranged surface 104 has been pro-<br>
vided parallel to this clamping surface 89. According to this illustrative<br>
embodiment, the surface 104 and the clamping surface 89 are provided<br>
roughly at an angle of 60° in the direction 48 or 49 with respect to the<br><br>
horizontally arranged supporting surfaces 101, 103. It is thus possible<br>
to remove the clamping element 82 from the clamping groove 86 by<br>
first displacing the clamping element 82 roughly in the transverse direc-<br>
tion 49 until this displacement is prevented by the clamping surface 89,<br>
and then displacing the clamping element 82 roughly in the transverse<br>
direction 48, that is to say roughly parallel to the clamping surface 89<br>
and the surface 104. In this embodiment, the component 79, in the light<br>
of a clamping arrangement according to the invention, can be referred<br>
to as the holder onto which the component 80 is clamped.<br>
According to a non-represented illustrative embodiment, the second<br>
component 80 can also however be a second component such as the<br>
second component 32 represented in figure 1, or another component<br>
that can be fastened to the component 79.<br>
In figure 8, a clamping arrangement 1 according to the invention is rep-<br>
resented, wherein the positioning slot 43 exhibits a triangular cross sec-<br>
tion. In the non-clamped state, as represented in figure 8, the clamping<br>
element 8 rests under the influence of gravity with the obliquely ar-<br>
ranged surfaces 20, 22 on the corresponding obliquely arranged sur-<br>
faces 41, 42 of the positioning slot 43. The surfaces 41, 42 of the posi-<br>
tioning slot 43 are arranged such that they align the clamping element 8<br>
fitted in the positioning slot 43 perfectly with respect to the screw ele-<br>
ments 11. That is to say that, in this embodiment, the roughly vertically<br>
arranged axes 50 of the openings 12 in the component 2, the openings<br>
23 in the clamping element 8 and the screw elements 11 coincide. As a<br>
result, the screw elements 11, which are fitted through the openings 12<br>
in the component 2, are perfectly aligned to be screwable into the<br>
openings 23 of the clamping element 8. This makes it possible to screw<br>
a large number of bolts 11 rapidly into the clamping element 8, or pos-<br>
sibly to automatize the fitting of the screw elements 11.<br>
In figure 9, a clamping arrangement 1 according to the invention is rep-<br><br>
resented, wherein the positioning slot 46 exhibits a cross section in the<br>
form of a polygon. In the non-clamped state, as represented in figure 9,<br>
the clamping element 8 rests under the influence of gravity with the<br>
obliquely arranged surfaces 20, 22 on the corresponding obliquely ar-<br>
ranged surfaces 44, 45 of the positioning slot 46. The surfaces 44, 45<br>
of the positioning slot 46 are arranged such that they align the clamping<br>
element 8 fitted in the positioning slot 46 perfectly with respect to the<br>
screw elements 11.<br>
In figure 10, a clamping arrangement 1 according to the invention is<br>
represented, having a positioning slot 57 of triangular cross section<br>
analogous to the illustrative embodiment as represented in figure 5.<br>
The clamping element 58 here exhibits a pentagonal cross section. In<br>
accordance with the illustrative embodiment as represented in figure 5,<br>
the obliquely arranged surfaces 51, 52 of the positioning slot 57 coop-<br>
erate with correspondingly obliquely arranged surfaces 53, 54 to align<br>
the fitted clamping element 58 perfectly with respect to the screw ele-<br>
ments 11. Furthermore, in the clamped state, the clamping surface 56<br>
of the clamping groove 14 of the holder 3 and the clamping surface 55<br>
of the component 2 cooperate with the corresponding clamping sur-<br>
faces 59, 60 of the clamping element 58. The obliquely arranged sur-<br>
face 52 of the positioning slot 57 is suitable for guiding the correspond-<br>
ing obliquely arranged surface 54 of the pentagonal clamping element<br>
58 as this clamping element 58 is transversely fitted into or removed<br>
from the positioning slot 57. Moreover, the surface 52 of the positioning<br>
slot 57 for guiding the clamping element 58 and the clamping surface<br>
56 of the clamping groove 14 of the holder 3 form an acute angle<br>
which, as can be seen in figure 10, widens in the direction of the open-<br>
ing along which the clamping element 58 can be moved transversely in<br>
the positioning slot 57. The clamping element 58 can hence comforta-<br>
bly be moved transversely into and out of the positioning slot 57. As the<br>
clamping element 58 is fitted into the positioning slot 57, the obliquely<br>
arranged surface 52 of the positioning slot 57, together with the<br><br>
obliquely arranged clamping surface 56 of the clamping groove 14, en-<br>
sures that the clamping element 58 cannot tilt, since the surface 52 and<br>
the clamping surface 56 respectively cooperate with corresponding sur-<br>
faces 54 and 59 of the clamping element 58. It can thereby be assured<br>
that, during the fitting of the clamping element 58, the openings 23 in<br>
the clamping element 58 maintain their roughly angular position.<br>
In figure 11, a variant embodiment of the clamping arrangement 1 ac-<br>
cording to the invention is represented. The cross section of the posi-<br>
tioning slot 66 is a polygon formed by a vertically arranged surface 61,<br>
a horizontally arranged surface 63 and two obliquely arranged surfaces<br>
62 and 64. Analogously to the illustrative embodiment as represented<br>
in figure 5, the two obliquely arranged surfaces 62, 64 of the positioning<br>
slot 66 cooperate with two correspondingly obliquely arranged surfaces<br>
of the hexagonal clamping element 8 to align the clamping element 8<br>
fitted in the positioning slot 66 perfectly with respect to the positioning<br>
slot 66 and the screw elements 11.<br>
In figures 12 and 13, a further variant embodiment of the clamping ar-<br>
rangement 1 according to the invention is represented, having a trape-<br>
zoidal clamping element 68 According to this embodiment, the clamp-<br>
ing arrangement 1 comprises screw elements 105 comprising a<br>
threaded rod 107 which can cooperate with a nut 108. This clamping<br>
element 68 likewise comprises two obliquely arranged clamping sur-<br>
faces 73, 75, which respectively cooperate with a clamping surface 69<br>
of the holder 3 and a clamping surface 77 of the component 2. The<br>
clamping element 68 additionally comprises a surface 76 directed to-<br>
ward the component 2. In the clamping groove 14 of the holder 3 there<br>
is likewise provided a positioning slot 67. This positioning slot 67 is<br>
formed by the vertically arranged surface 70, the horizontally arranged<br>
surface 71 and the obliquely arranged surface 72. As represented in<br>
figure 13, the clamping element 68 can be fitted transversely into the<br>
positioning slot 67, where in the non-clamped state, under the influence<br><br>
of gravity, it rests with the horizontal surface 74 on the corresponding<br>
horizontal surface 71 of the positioning slot 67. The surfaces 70 and 72<br>
delimit the positioning slot 67 such that the fitted clamping element 68<br>
is positioned roughly correctly with respect to the threaded rods 107 to<br>
be fitted. The threaded rods 107 are screwed through the openings 12<br>
in the component 2 into the openings 23 in the clamping element 68.<br>
After this, the nuts 108 are screwed onto the threaded rods to move the<br>
clamping element 68 up to the component 2.<br>
It is also possible to secure the threaded rods 107 in the openings 23 in<br>
the clamping element 68, for example by gluing them in place or fixing<br>
them in some other way. The clamping element 68 can then, together<br>
with the threaded rods 107, be moved as a whole into and out of the<br>
positioning slot 67. According to one option, the component 2 can be<br>
provided with a slot extending in the longitudinal direction 47, instead of<br>
having separate openings 12 for each threaded rod 107. As repre-<br>
sented in figure 12, the clamping surface 109 of the clamping tooth 4<br>
and the corresponding clamping surface 110 of the clamping groove 14<br>
are, in this embodiment, arranged at a specific small angle to the verti-<br>
cal, which is advantageous for the clamping of the clamping tooth 4 in<br>
the clamping groove 14. According to a non-represented variant, in the<br>
embodiment of figure 12 the clamping surfaces 109 and 110 can also<br>
be arranged roughly vertically.<br>
In figure 14, a clamping arrangement 1 according to the invention is<br>
represented, having a positioning slot 117 of a cross section comprising<br>
a vertically arranged surface 119 and two obliquely arranged surfaces<br>
111	and 112. The clamping element 118 here exhibits a quadrilateral<br>
cross section, more particularly a square cross section. Similarly to the<br>
illustrative embodiment of figure 8, the obliquely arranged surfaces 111,<br>
112	of the positioning slot 117 cooperate with corresponding obliquely<br>
arranged surfaces 113, 114 of the clamping element 118, in order to<br>
align a fitted clamping element 118 perfectly with respect to the screw<br><br>
elements 11. Furthermore, in the clamped state, the clamping surface<br>
116 of the clamping groove 14 of the holder 3 and the clamping surface<br>
115 of the component 2 cooperate with the corresponding clamping<br>
surfaces 120, 121 of the clamping element 118. The obliquely arranged<br>
surface 112 of the positioning slot 117 is suitable for guiding the corre-<br>
sponding obliquely arranged surface 114 of the quadrilateral clamping<br>
element 118 as this clamping element 118 is transversely fitted into or<br>
removed from the positioning slot 117. Moreover, the surface 112 of the<br>
positioning slot 117 for guiding the clamping element 118 and the<br>
clamping surface 116 of the clamping groove 14 of the holder 3 are ar-<br>
ranged roughly parallel with each other. The clamping element 118 can<br>
hence comfortably be moved transversely into and out of the position-<br>
ing slot 117 and it is ensured that, during the fitting of the clamping<br>
element 118, the openings 23 in the clamping element 118 maintain<br>
their roughly angular position. It is clear that, instead of a square, any<br>
other quadrilateral whatsoever can be used as the clamping element.<br>
In figure 15, a variant embodiment of a clamping arrangement 1 ac-<br>
cording to the invention is represented in accordance with the illustra-<br>
tive embodiment as represented in figure 3. In figure 15, the openings<br>
23 are not provided centrally in the hexagonal clamping element 8, but,<br>
in particular, these openings 23 are provided somewhat eccentrically.<br>
In figures 16 and 17, an embodiment of a clamping arrangement 1 ac-<br>
cording to the invention is represented in accordance with figures 3 and<br>
5, the clamping arrangement 1 being represented in an angular position<br>
which is turned approximately 90° with respect to the angular position<br>
represented in figures 3 and 5.<br>
In figures 18 and 19, an embodiment of a clamping arrangement 1 ac-<br>
cording to the invention is represented in accordance with figures 3 and<br>
5, the clamping arrangement 1 being represented in an angular position<br>
which is turned approximately 60° with respect to the angular position<br><br>
represented in figures 3 and 5. It is clear that non-represented variant<br>
embodiments are possible, wherein a clamping arrangement 1 has<br>
been turned through any other angle whatsoever, the clamping element<br>
8 being able to be held in a clamping groove 16.<br>
In figure 20, a further variant embodiment of a clamping arrangement 1<br>
according to the invention is represented in accordance with the em-<br>
bodiment as represented in figure 3, wherein the axis 50 of the screw<br>
elements 11 and the openings 122 in the component 2 and the open-<br>
ings 123 in the clamping element 8 are provided at an angle to the per-<br>
pendicular on the roughly horizontal surface 7 of the hexagonal clamp-<br>
ing element 8.<br>
It is clear that, according to a non-represented variant, the screw ele-<br>
ment 11 can be arranged both non-centrally, analogously to figure 15,<br>
and also at an angle, analogously to figure 20.<br>
Other combinations of clamping elements and associated positioning<br>
slots are, of course, possible. More particularly, in addition to clamping<br>
elements of trapezoidal, pentagonal and hexagonal cross section,<br>
clamping elements of some other cross section, for example heptago-<br>
nal, octagonal, square or any other polygon whatsoever, are also con-<br>
ceivable. A clamping element 8 of hexagonal cross section can be sim-<br>
ply and cheaply produced.<br>
It is clear that a pentagonal or hexagonal clamping element as repre-<br>
sented in figure 1 to 9 is particularly advantageous, since the openings<br>
23 in the clamping element which are provided with an internal thread<br>
for the reception of the screw elements 11 exhibit approximately twice<br>
the length of the available openings 23 in the case of a trapezoidal<br>
clamping element with corresponding clamping surfaces. This ensures<br>
a better connection between the clamping element and the screw ele-<br>
ments.<br><br>
The clamping arrangement 1 according to the invention enables an<br>
elongated component 2 for a weaving machine to be clamped onto a<br>
holder 3 by first fitting the clamping element 8 transversely into a posi-<br>
tioning slot 16, then fitting the component 2 onto the holder 3, and then<br>
fitting the screw elements 11 through openings 12 in the component 2<br>
so as to screw them into openings 23 of the clamping element 8. The<br>
clamping arrangement 1 according to the invention also allows an<br>
elongated component 2 for a weaving machine, which component is<br>
clamped on a holder 3, to be removed from this holder 3 by unscrewing<br>
the bolts 11 from the clamping element 8, then removing them through<br>
openings 12 in the component 2, then removing the component 2 from<br>
the holder 3, and then transversely removing the clamping element 8<br>
from the positioning slot 16 and the holder 3.<br>
The screw elements 11, 83, 105 are not limited to the represented bolts<br>
or threaded rods but can likewise comprise other elements, for example<br>
hexagon socket bolts or screwed bushes. According to a non-<br>
represented variant, instead of separate openings 12 in the component,<br>
a slot extending in the longitudinal direction 47 can be provided.<br>
In figures 3 and 4 and in figures 8 to 13, the component 2 has been ar-<br>
ranged, for the sake of clarity, at a short distance from the holder 3. In<br>
these positions, in actual fact, the component 2 is supported on the<br>
holder 3 in a manner as represented in figure 1. The screw elements<br>
11, 83, 105 can move with sufficient play in the openings 12, 84, 122,<br>
so that the screw elements can easily be screwed into the clamping<br>
element should the component 2 be arranged on the holder 3, more<br>
particularly should the component 2 be arranged in a position on the<br>
holder 3 which is approximately consistent with the clamping position of<br>
the component 2 on the holder 3.<br>
The weaving machine, the clamping arrangement for the clamping, and<br>
the methods according to the invention are not limited, of course, to the<br><br>
embodiments described by way of example and represented in the fig-<br>
ure, but can be realized within the scope of the invention according to<br>
different variants and according to different combinations of the afore-<br>
said represented embodiments according to the invention.<br><br>
