				<td>Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to the field of biodegradable copolymers. It concerns<br>
more particularly a novel copolymer composition based on a polysaccharide backbone<br>
grafted with amphiphilic diblock copolymers. The compositions of the invention can find<br>
use in various fields of application in particular in pharmaceutical, perfume and flavour<br>
areas, as they adopt, in a particular environment, a core-shell conformation which renders<br>
them suitable to be used as delivery systems for active ingredients. The invention also<br>
concerns a process for the preparation of such copolymer compositions.<br>
Background Art<br>
Biodegradable copolymer compositions as well as their use as carriers for<br>
biologically active materials have been described in the prior art, both in the general<br>
literature and in the patent literature. In fact, many biodegradable copolymers have been<br>
developed for medical applications, and more particularly for the encapsulation of drugs.<br>
In the patent literature, some disclosures in the area of biodegradable copolymer<br>
compositions are directed to the use of diblock, triblock or multiblock copolymers which<br>
consist of sequenced structures, wherein segments of various natures (e.g. hydrophobic<br>
and hydrophilic segments) are covalently linked together. WO 02/39979, US 5,221,534 or<br>
US 5,756,082 provide examples of preparation of such structures and describe their uses<br>
as drug delivery systems, as well as in cosmetic compositions or other applications.<br>
On the other hand, by opposition to sequenced structures, grafted structures based<br>
on biodegradable polymer compositions have also been the object of patents and patent<br>
applications. In particular, systems based on the grafting of single polymers along<br>
polysaccharide chains have been disclosed. WO 01/79315 describes for instance<br>
copolymer compositions consisting of a hydrophobic macromolecule such as a polylactic<br>
acid cross-linked with a water-soluble polymer having multiple hydroxyl functionalities<br>
which may serve as potential reaction sites. The described composition can be used as a<br>
controlled drug delivery system.<br>
More recently, US 2002/0146826 has described a system based on a<br>
polysaccharide chain which has been grafted with an ohgoamrne on the one hand, and by<br>
at least one further group selected from the group consisting of a hydrophobic and an<br>
amphiphilic group. The oligoamines are conjugated with at least one oligomer per five<br>
saccharide units, whereas the hydrophobic and amphiphilic groups are positioned with at<br>
least one group per 50 saccharide units. The document discloses the application of said<br>
systems to gene therapy.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Now, the present invention concerns new biodegradable polymeric systems, based<br>
on the use of a polysaccharide backbone which has been grafted with amphiphilic diblock<br>
copolymers. Such systems have never been described in the prior art and they proved to<br>
constitute very advantageous delivery systems for drugs, flavours, fragrances or other<br>
active ingredients.<br>
A first object of the present invention relates to a copolymer comprising a<br>
polysaccharide backbone and amphiphilic diblock copolymers grafted on said<br>
polysaccharide backbone, each amphiphilic diblock comprising:<br>
a) a hydrophobic polymeric segment directly grafted on the polysaccharide backbone<br>
and comprising from 5 to 200 repeated units; and<br>
b) a hydrophilic polymeric segment covalently bonded to the hydrophobic segment and<br>
comprising from 5 to 300 repeated units.<br>
Said compositions proved to adopt a core-shell structure when put into an aqueous<br>
medium, and thus form particles that can be useful as delivery systems for active<br>
ingredients as varied as drugs, flavours or fragrance ingredients or compositions. These<br>
particles, as well as their use as delivery systems and functional compositions such as<br>
perfumes, foods or pharmaceutical compositions comprising these delivery systems, are<br>
also object of the invention.<br>
Furthermore the present invention concerns a process for the preparation of a<br>
copolymer as defined above, which comprises the major steps of preparing a micro-<br>
initiator by chemical modification of a polysaccharide; using said macro-initiator to<br>
polymerise hydrophobic monomers providing hydrophobic primary segments grafted on<br>
the polysaccharide; using the obtained polymer as a micro-initiator to polymerise<br>
monomers constituting secondary segments covalently linked to the hydrophobic primary<br>
ones ; and optionally chemically modifying the secondary segments.<br>
The present invention thus relates to a copolymer comprising a polysaccharide<br>
backbone and amphiphilic diblock copolymers grafted on said polysaccharide backbone.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the amphiphilic diblock copolymers are grafted on<br>
said backbone with a degree of substitution via hydroxyl functions comprised between<br>
30% and 80%. Each amphiphilic diblock comprises a hydrophobic polymeric segment<br>
directly grafted on the polysaccharide backbone, comprising from 5 to 200 repeated units,<br>
and a hydrophilic polymeric segment covalently bonded to the hydrophobic segment<br>
comprising from 5 to 300 repeated units. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the<br>
hydrophobic segments comprises 15-100 repeated units, and the hydrophilic polymeric<br>
segment comprises 15-200 repeated units.<br>
Preferably, each amphiphilic diblock consists of a hydrophobic polymeric<br>
segment and a hydrophilic polymeric segment.<br>
The copolymer of the invention is novel, as no document from the prior art has<br>
ever described the grafting of a polysaccharide with amphiphilic diblock copolymers. The<br>
composition of the invention, besides being novel, proved to form particles which can be<br>
very useful as delivery systems for active ingredients enclosed therein. In fact, in an<br>
aqueous medium, the amphiphilic copolymers of the invention adopt a core-shell<br>
structure, the physico-chemical characteristics of which can be tuned by varying the<br>
degree of polymerisation of each segment, the functionality of the amphiphilic block and<br>
the grafting density. Depending on the latest parameter, the copolymer compositions can<br>
form a stable aqueous dispersion of isolated macromolecules.<br>
More objects, aspects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from<br>
the detailed description hereinafter.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The biodegradable polymer of the invention is based on a polysaccharide<br>
backbone which has been grafted with amphiphilic diblock copolymers, preferably with a<br>
degree of substitution via hydroxyl functions comprised between 30% and 80%. Any<br>
polysaccharide, preferably biodegradable, can suit the invention. Typical examples of<br>
appropriate polysaccharide chains include those selected from the group consisting of<br>
dextrans, arabinogalactan, pullulan, cellulose, cellobios, inulin, chitosan, alginates,<br>
hyaluronic acid and cyclodextrins. According to a preferred embodiment, the<br>
polysaccharide used in the present invention has a molecular weight higher than<br>
800 g/mol.<br>
Preferably, the copolymer of the invention is a biodegradable copolymer.<br>
Preferably, the copolymer of the invention is present in the form of a copolymer<br>
composition.<br>
The amphiphilic diblock copolymers grafted on the polysaccharide backbone<br>
consist each of a hydrophobic polymeric segment comprising from 5 to 200, preferably<br>
15-100 repeated units, said hydrophobic polymeric segment being directly grafted on the<br>
polysaccharide; and a hydrophilic polymeric segment comprising from 5-300, preferably<br>
15 to 200 repeated units, which is covalently bonded to the hydrophobic segment.<br>
Hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity of the segments constituting the amphiphilic<br>
diblock copolymer entity is defined as follows: A polymer segment is hydrophobic it is<br>
either insoluble in water or less soluble in water than the hydrophilic polymer segment. A<br>
polymer segment is hydrophilic if it can be dissolved at 0.01wt.% or more in water at<br>
room temperature (25°C) following the procedure of US 6,733,787, Example 2, which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference. For example, a diblock-copolymer ([A]n-[B]p) grafted<br>
on a polysaccharide backbone fulfils the hydrophobicity/ -philicity requirements of the<br>
present invention if a polymer [A]n cannot be dissolved at 0.01wt.-% in water and if a<br>
polymer [B]p, in contrast, can be dissolved at 0.01wt.-%. in water.<br>
As a generally good indication, the calculated Van Krevelen solubility parameter,<br>
can be adduced for determining if a segment of the copolymer of the invention is<br>
hydrophobic or hydrophilic: Van Krevelen/Hofzyger "Properties of Polymers", p. 200-<br>
225 by D.W. van Krevelen (Elsevier, 1990). A polymer block or segment is hydrophobic<br>
if the vanKrevelen/Hofzyger solubility parameter and 3-D solubility parameter is 
The polymer is hydrophilic if the parameter is &gt; 25.<br>
For determining the parameter values for the purpose.of the present invention, a<br>
number of 8 polymerised monomeric units with unrepealed terminal endings replaced by<br>
H- are taken as a reference molecule. For example, for a polymer comprising tert-butyl<br>
acrylate as monomeric moieties the standard-molecule below is used to calculate the<br>
vahKrevelen/Hofzyger solubility parameter. ,<br><br>
The vanKrevelen/Hofzyger solubility parameter can be approximated by software<br>
tools like Molecular Modeling Pro, version 5.22, commercialized by Norgwyn<br>
Montgomery Software Inc, ©2003. For the polymer above, a value of 29.35 is obtained.<br>
Alternatively, Hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity can be defined using the<br>
Hildebrand solubility parameter, also called Hansen solubility parameter, well known in<br>
the art, which characterises the polarity of chemical ingredients. Ethanol is usually taken<br>
as reference, the latter having a solubility parameter 5 of 25. A segment will thus be<br>
considered as hydrophobic when its Hansen solubility parameter is below or equal to 25<br>
and as hydrophilic when its solubility parameter is above 25. The Hansen solubility<br>
parameter may be approximated, by the above indicated software and standard-molecule.<br>
Hydrophobic polymeric segments susceptible of being grafted directly onto the<br>
polysaccharide backbone are characterised by the number of repeated units which is<br>
comprised between 5 and 200, preferably 15 and 100. They are preferably selected from<br>
the group consisting of polylactides, polycaprolactone, polypropylene glycol and<br>
polyanhydrides.<br>
Hydrophilic polymeric segments susceptible of being covalently bonded to the<br>
hydrophobic polymeric segments are characterised by the number of repeated units which<br>
is comprised between 5 and 300, preferably 15 and 200. They are preferably selected<br>
from the group consisting of poly (meth)acrylic acid, polydimethyl aminoethyl<br>
(meth)acrylate, polytrimethyl ammonium ethyl (meth)acrylate salts, polyhydroxyethyl<br>
(meth)acrylate, polymethylether diethyleneglycol (meth)acrylate, polyethylene oxide,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyaminoacids and polyacrylonitriles. The term (meth)acrylate<br>
encompasses the corresponding acrylates and/or methacrylates.<br>
In an aqueous environment the copolymer composition of the invention takes the<br>
organised form of a core-shell. Therefore, another object of the invention concerns a<br>
particle having a core-shell structure, consisting of a biodegradable copolymer<br>
composition as defined above. More particularly, when contacted with an aqueous<br>
medium, the hydrophobic blocks of the composition according to this invention are<br>
grouped so as to constitute the core and the hydrophilic blocks are arranged so as to form<br>
a shell around the hydrophobic block. The system is arranged around the polysaccharide<br>
backbone forming a particle and it can thus be advantageously used as a delivery system<br>
for an active ingredient, in particular for a hydrophobic ingredient that would be, due to<br>
its nature, embedded in the core part, the polymer matrix thus providing a controlled<br>
delivery system for this active ingredient.<br>
The above-mentioned particles are obtainable by a process comprising contacting<br>
the copolymer composition of the invention with an aqueous medium.<br>
They have a mean diameter preferably comprised between 10 and 500 nm.<br>
The particles thus formed are susceptible of entrapping an active ingredient such<br>
as a drug, a flavour or a fragrance ingredient or composition and can be used as delivery<br>
systems for the controlled release of the latter ingredient or composition through its<br>
diffusion from the copolymer composition, prior to copolymer degradation, or by release<br>
from the copolymer matrix as the polymer degrades. The release of encapsulated active<br>
ingredients may be regulated in part by the molecular weight of the various polymers of<br>
the composition and also by the grafting density.<br>
In a particular embodiment, the active material susceptible of being protected is a<br>
perfume or flavour ingredient or composition. The terms " perfume or flavour ingredient<br>
or composition" are deemed to designate a variety of flavour and fragrance materials of<br>
both natural and synthetic origin. They include single compounds and mixtures. Natural<br>
extracts can also be encapsulated within the particles of the invention; these include e.g.<br>
citrus extracts, such as lemon, orange, lime, grapefruit, or mandarin oils, or essential oils<br>
of spices, amongst other. Specific examples of such flavour and perfume components<br>
may be found in the current literature, e.g. in Perfume and Flavour Chemicals, 1969, by<br>
S. Arctander, Montclair NJ. (USA); Fenaroli's Handbook of Flavour Ingredients, CRC<br>
Press or Synthetic Food Adjuncts by M.B. Jacobs, van Nostrand Co., Inc. They are well<br>
known to the skilled person in the art of perfuming, flavouring and/or aromatising<br>
consumer products, i.e. of imparting an odour or taste to a consumer product.<br>
The active ingredient can be loaded into the particles by absorption and, or<br>
diffusion. This loading can be obtained by dispersing a pre-mixed composition of<br>
copolymer and active ingredient into an aqueous medium. More particularly, a process for<br>
the preparation of a delivery system according to the invention comprises the steps of<br>
preparing a copolymer composition as detailed below, drying said composition and<br>
mixing the dried composition with an active ingredient or composition. The latter can be<br>
present in the system in amounts varying between 5 and 70% by weight relative to the<br>
total weight of the delivery system.<br>
When the particles of the invention enclose a perfume ingredient or composition,<br>
they can be advantageously used in many applications in perfumery, both in fine and<br>
functional perfumery. In particular, they can be used, together with other perfuming<br>
ingredients, solvents or adjuvants of current use in the preparation of a perfume<br>
formulation, in applications such as in a perfume, an eau de toilette, or an after-shave<br>
lotion, but also in functional products, together with functional constituents of bases<br>
present in products such as soaps, bath or shower gels, shampoos or other hair-care<br>
products, cosmetic preparations, deodorants or air-fresheners, detergents or fabric<br>
softeners or household products. Functional ingredients present in these bases have<br>
detergent, cleaning, purifying, softening, antibacterial, or stabilising-type of properties.<br>
In all applications, the particles of the invention filled in with perfume may be<br>
used as such or as part of a perfuming formulation comprising other perfuming<br>
ingredients, solvents or adjuvants or current use in the preparation of perfume<br>
formulations.<br>
The terms "perfume formulation" must be understood within the framework of the<br>
art of perfumery. More particularly, they designate in a general manner, a blend of<br>
odoriferous materials, perceived as having its own unique and aesthetically appropriate<br>
identity. It is a carefully balanced blend (specific ingredients in specific proportions) in<br>
which each material plays its part in achieving the overall fragrance. This creative and<br>
original composition is thus structurally characterised by a formulation constituted by the<br>
ingredients themselves and their relative proportions.<br>
A perfume formulation in the field of perfumery is not just a mixture of pleasantly<br>
smelling materials. On the other hand, a chemical reaction involving reactants and<br>
products formed, which constitutes a dynamic system, cannot be assimilated, unless<br>
otherwise specified, to a perfume formulation, even when odoriferous materials are<br>
present among the starting products, the formed products, or even both of them.<br>
Now, apart from having a well defined identity, a perfume or perfume formulation<br>
must meet a number of technical requirements. It must be for instance sufficiently strong,<br>
it must be diffusive, it must be persistent, and it must retain its essential fragrancing<br>
character throughout its period of evaporation.<br>
Besides, a perfume formulation must be adapted as a function of the application<br>
for which it is intended. In particular, a perfume formulation may be designated for fine<br>
fragrance or designed for a functional product (soap, detergent, cosmetics, etc.) which<br>
needs to present a degree of persistence appropriate to the use for which it is intended.<br>
The formulations must also be chemically stable in the end product. The technique by<br>
which this is achieved is an essential part of the perfumer's art, and it is needed many<br>
years of dedicated work to arrive at the level of experience necessary to formulate<br>
perfumes or perfume formulations that are not only original but also well made.<br>
Now, these technical considerations imply that a perfume formulation may<br>
comprise other ingredients than perfuming materials, which are hereby designated as<br>
"solvents or adjuvants of current use in the preparation of a perfume formulation".<br>
First of all, independently of whether the composition is designed for fine<br>
perfumery or for use in a technical product, a solvent system is most of the time part of<br>
the fragrance. Solvents currently used in the preparation of a perfume formulation<br>
include, but are not limited to, dipropylene glycol, diethyl phtalate, isopropyl myristate,<br>
benzyl benzoate, 2-(2-ethoxyethoxy)-l-ethanol or ethyl citrate for the most commonly<br>
used.<br>
On the other hand, the creation of a perfume formulation intended for a functional<br>
product involves considerations both of hedonics (how should the product smell) and of<br>
the technique of adapting the perfume to the product formulation or, as is often said, to<br>
the product base. The perfume formulation may therefore comprise "adjuvants" which can<br>
have many different functions, depending on the base which has to be perfumed. These<br>
adjuvants include for instance stabilisers and antioxidants.<br>
Today, the range of product types and product formulations that are perfumed has<br>
become so extensive and subjected to such frequent changes that an approach based on a<br>
product-by-product basis and on the definition for each case of the adjuvants that can be<br>
used, is impractical. That is why the present application does not comprise an exhaustive<br>
list or detailed approach of the solvents or adjuvants currently used in perfume<br>
formulations. However, a skilled person in the art, i.e. an expert perfumer, is capable of<br>
choosing these ingredients as a function of the product to be perfumed and of the nature<br>
of the perfuming ingredients in the perfume.<br>
On the other hand, when the particles of the invention enclose a flavour ingredient<br>
or composition, they may be added to a flavouring composition or directly to an edible<br>
ready-to-consume product. By "flavouring composition", it is meant here a mixture of<br>
flavouring ingredients, solvents or adjuvants or current use for the preparation of a<br>
i<br>
flavouring formulation, i.e. a particular mixture of ingredients which is intended to be<br>
added to an edible composition to impart, improve or modify its organoleptic properties,<br>
in particular its odour, flavour and/or taste.<br>
Solvents and adjuvants of current use for the preparation of a flavouring<br>
formulation are also well known in the art. They allow flavouring formulations to meet<br>
technical requirements, such as stability or tonality persistence. The solvent is most of the<br>
time part of a flavouring composition. Solvents currently used in this framework include<br>
for instance benzyl alcohol, propylene glycol, triacetine, vegetable oils, ethanol or<br>
limonene. The adjuvants, on the other hand, can have many various functions in a<br>
flavouring composition. They include for instance stabilizers.<br>
On the other hand, the particles of the invention can also be directly added to a<br>
ready-to-consume or end-product. In other words, they can either be initially added to a<br>
flavouring composition as defined above, the resulting composition being then added to<br>
an end-product, or be added independently of a flavouring composition to an edible<br>
product.<br>
In a third embodiment, when the particles of the invention enclose a drug, they<br>
can be added to pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
Other actives may be enclosed in the particles of the invention, such as<br>
nutraceuticals, or sweeteners for instance. The cited actives should thus not be considered<br>
as limiting the invention.<br>
In compositions such as perfume formulations, flavouring compositions or<br>
pharmaceutical compositions, the particles of the invention can be used in a wide range of<br>
concentrations, depending on the application and on the desired effect. A skilled person in<br>
the art is able to choose the right dosage for a particular application.<br>
Another object of the invention is a process for the preparation of a biodegradable<br>
copolymer composition as defined above. The process of the invention comprises the<br>
major steps of preparing a micro-initiator by chemical modification of a polysaccharide ;<br>
using said macro-initiator to polymerise hydrophobic monomers providing hydrophobic<br>
primary segments grafted on the polysaccharide; using the obtained polymer as a micro-<br>
initiator to polymerise monomers constituting secondary segments covalently linked to<br>
the primary segments ; and if necessary chemically modifying the hydrophilic segments.<br>
More particularly, the first step of the process of the invention consists in partially<br>
protecting the hydroxyl groups of a polysaccharide chain by silylation of hydroxyl<br>
functions. The ratio between the polysaccharide hydroxyl functions and the sylilation<br>
agent is comprised between 1 and 3 equivalents so as to provide 20 to 70% of protected<br>
polysaccharide hydroxyl functions. The ratio of protected hydroxyl functions can be<br>
controlled by NMR analysis. Sylilation is well known in the art and a skilled person is<br>
able to choose suitable reaction conditions and a suitable sylilation agent.<br>
Hexamethyldisilazane is commonly used as sylilation agent. A detailed description of this<br>
step will be given in the examples below.<br>
The unprotected hydroxyl functions of the modified polysaccharide are used in the<br>
second step of the process as initiator for the polymerisation of hydrophobic monomers.<br>
In other words, the obtained modified polysaccharide backbone constitutes a macro-<br>
initiator capable of initiating the polymerisation of various monomers, which<br>
polymerisation is carried out in the second step of the process by ring opening<br>
polymerisation. During this second step, hydrophobic segments also referred to as<br>
"primary segments" are thus grafted onto the polysaccharide backbone. Preferably, the<br>
polymerisation is carried out at a temperature comprised between 120 and 150°C and in<br>
the presence of a catalyst. Specific experimental conditions will be given in a more<br>
detailed manner in the examples below.<br>
In a third step, the ending groups of the hydrophobic segments now grafted on the<br>
polyaccharide backbone are esterified by means of an initiator, namely an alkyl bromide,<br>
in order to provide bromide functions. This newly formed macro-initiator is capable of<br>
polymerising monomers, such as (meth-) acrylate monomers, which polymerisation<br>
constitutes the last essential step of the process. In a particular embodiment, this<br>
polymerisation is carried out by Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (ATPR), which is<br>
a known technique commonly used for the synthesis of well-defined diblock, triblock and<br>
grafted copolymers, as reported in reference articles, such as in Hedrick J.L. et al.,<br>
Macromolecules, 1998, 31, 8691. This article describes that the esterification of hydroxyl<br>
functions of a hydrophobic block can be obtained by an initiator such as an alkyl bromide.<br>
This process allows the polymerisation of a wide range of functional monomers and is not<br>
sensitive to protonic solvents or functions such as hydroxyl. During the fourth step of the<br>
process according to the invention, monomers are polymerised to provide secondary<br>
segments which are covalently bonded to the primary hydrophobic segments. In a first<br>
embodiment, the monomers used in this step are hydrophilic and this step this directly<br>
lead to the desired product, namely amphiphilic polymer diblocks grafted on a<br>
polysaccharide chain. Now, according to a second embodiment, the monomers<br>
polymerised in the fourth step of the process are hydrophobic. In that case, a fifth step is<br>
necessary to modify the secondary segments in order to render them hydrophilic. This is<br>
possible through a chemical modification of the latter segment. Therefore, functions<br>
present on the secondary segments can be chemically modified in a last step of the<br>
process. As example, quaternization can be performed in order to provide a cationic shell<br>
of the comb. Hydrolysis is another possibility of chemical modification. These<br>
modifications can also influence the solubility of the particles in water.<br>
The described process allows to provide a composition which takes a core-shell<br>
structure when contacted with water. The latter has a hydrophilic shell, which can be<br>
anionic (e.g. with polymethacrylic acid), cationic (e.g. with salt of polytrimethyl<br>
ammoniumethyl methacrylate) or non-ionic (e.g. with polyhydroxyethyl methacrylate,<br>
polymethylether diethyleneglycol methacrylate).<br>
The present invention further relates to a perfumed product comprising the<br>
copolymer of the present invention. Preferably, the perfumed product is a liquid product.<br>
For example, the perfumed product is a perfume, an eau de toilette, a shampoo, a<br>
conditioner, a shower gel, a soap (liquid or solid), a cream, a lotion, a liquid detergent, a<br>
solid detergent, or a fabric softener. The polymer of the invention may be directly added<br>
to the product, if it is a liquid. Alternatively, it first be brought in contact with a perfume<br>
in order to absorb or associate fragrance compounds within its hydrophobic block.<br>
Thereafter, the polymer may be added to the product at any stage in the manufacturing of<br>
the product, preferably when perfumes are added.<br>
Figure 1 shows the corresponding average curves showing the evolution of the weight •<br>
loss of linalool with time. One could observe a significant effect of the copolymer on the<br>
fragrance release. The isotherm of the release of linalool seems to be composed of two<br>
regimes : a fast regime at the beginning of the isotherm followed by a slow one. This<br>
effect is not observed for the HPC samples.<br>
Figure 2 shows the corresponding average curves showing the evolution of the weight<br>
. loss of a fragrance with time in EDT, in the presence or not of grafted copolymers. There<br>
are three main phases, the first one corresponding to the loss mainly of water and ethanol,<br>
the second one is a plateau persisting for about 3000 seconds characterized by low loss of<br>
fragrance at 50°C and the last one, the complete loss of fragrance by gradually increasing<br>
the temperature to 150°C.<br>
The invention will now be described in a more detailed manner in the following examples<br>
wherein the temperatures are indicated in degrees Celsius and the abbreviations have the<br>
usual meaning in the art.<br>
Modes of Carrying out the Invention<br>
General comments<br>
a) Chemicals<br>
Solvents and pentamemyldiemylenetriamine (PMEDETA) were distilled on CaH2 and<br>
stored under nitrogen. Methacrylate and acrylate monomers were purified by filtration<br>
on a column of an inhibitor-remover (CAS 9003-70-7 ; origin : Aldrich). The cupper<br>
bromide (CAS 7787-70-4; origin: Aldrich) and the hydroxypropyl-cellulose<br>
(Mw=l 00000 g.mol"1; origin : Aldrich, CAS 9004-64-2) were used as received. The<br>
(3S)-cis-3,6-dimethyl-l,4-dioxane-2,5-dione was recrystallized in ethyl acetate before<br>
used.<br>
b) Size Exclusion Chomatography (SEC)<br>
SEC measurements were carried out with a column Macherey-Nagel Nucluogel GPC<br>
104-5. As a solvent, THF HPLC grade was used. The polymer concentration was<br>
fixed at 4mg/ml. The flow rate was lml/min and the injection volume was 50<br>
microliters.<br>

preparation was done with HPC. The two samples were kept at room temperature for at<br>
least one day. Then, an amount of 10 mg of each sample was analysed with<br>
Thermogravimetry Analyser by recording the isotherms at 25° under a constant flow of<br>
nitrogen gas (20 ml/min). The analysis was repeated three times with HPC-PLLA-<br>
PTMASEMA/linalool sample (masse : 8.99, 9.57 and 8.85 mg) and two times with<br>
HPC/linalool sample (masse : 9.76 and 9.77 mg). The time of the isotherm was fixed at<br>

Different copolymers (Examples Id, 5f and 5g) (0.5wt.%) have been solubilised in an<br>
EDT, containing 80% of ethanol, 10% of water and 10% of a fragrance (benzyle<br>
salycilate 35g, habanolide (1-OXA-12-CYCLOHEXADECEN-2-ONE) 2g, cetalox 2g, hedione<br>
((+-VMETHYL 3-OXO-2-PENTYL-1-CYCLOPENTANEACETATE) 35g, bacdanol (2-ETHYL-4-<br>

6g, zestover (2,4-DMETHYL-3-CYCLOHEXENE-l-CARBALDEHYDE) 2g).<br>
Then, 10 fiL of these solutions are put in an alumina crucible. The weight loss of<br>
fragrance has been measured by thermogravimetric analyses (two times each sample)<br>
under a constant flow of nitrogen (20mVrnin). The measurements (figure 2) start at 25°C<br>
to 50°C (5°C/min), stay at 50°C for 115 minutes and then until 150°C (10°C/min).<br>
The results are shown in Figure 2. It can be seen that weight loss during 115 minutes at<br>
50°C is highest with the EDT devoid of the copolymer of the invention (lowest line,<br>
"Perfume, EtOH/Eau), while samples provided with the copolymer of Examples Id, 5g<br>
and 5f of the invention show clearly less loss (upper 3 lines), with small differences<br>
between the various polymers.<br>
