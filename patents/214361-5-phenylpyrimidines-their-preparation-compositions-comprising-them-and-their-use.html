Moreover, the invention relates to proC6sses for preparing these compounds, to compositions comprising them and to their use for controlling harmful fungi.<br>
Pyridylpyrimidine derivatives having fungiC1dal action are known from EP-A 407 899, DE-A 42 27 811 and WO-A 92/10490. Tetrahydropyrimidine derivatives having fungiC1dal action are known from GB-A 2 277 090.<br>
The compounds described in the abovementioned publications are suitable for use as crop protection agents against harmful fungi.<br>
However, in many cases their activity is unsatisfactory.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide compounds having improved activity.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by the phenylpyrimidine derivatives I defined at the outset. Moreover, we have found proC6sses for their preparation and compositions comprising them for controlling harmful fungi and their use for this purpose.<br>
Compared to the prior-art compounds, the compounds of the formula I have increased activity against harmful fungi.<br>
The compounds I can be obtained by different routes.<br>
To prepare compounds of the formula I in which R^ is cyano or a group bound via a heteroatom, the starting materials used are advantageously sulfones of the formula II. In the formula II, the substituents Xm and R^ to B?  are as defined in formula I and R is C1-C4-alkyl, preferably methyl.<br>
The sulfones of the formula II are reacted under basic conditions with compounds of the formula III. For practical reasons, it is alternatively possible to employ directly the alkali metal, alkaline earth metal or ammonium salt of the compound III.<br>
A<br><br><br><br>
This reaction is usually carried out at temperatures of from 250°C to 250°C, preferably from 40°C to 210°c, in an inert organic solvent in the presenC6 of a base [cf. DE-A 39 01 084; Chamita, 50. , 525-530 (1996); Chime. Geterotsikl. Soedin, 12. 1696-1697(1998).<br>
Suitable solvents are halogenated hydrocarbons, ethers, such as diethyl ether, isopropyl ether, tert-butyl methyl ether, i 1,2-dimethoxyethane, dioxane, anisole and tetrahydrofuran, and also dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethylformamide and dimethylaC6tamide. Particular preferenC6 is given to ethanol, dichloromethane, aC6tonitrile and tetrahydrofuran. It is also possible to use mixtures of the solvents mentioned.<br>
Suitable bases are, in general, inorganic compounds, such as alkali metal and alkaline earth metal hydroxides, such as lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and calC1um hydroxide, alkali metal and alkaline earth metal hydrides, such as lithium hydride, sodium hydride, potassium hydride and calC1um hydride, and alkali metal and alkaline earth metal carbonates, such as lithium carbonate, potassium carbonate and calC1um carbonate. The bases are generally employed in catalytic amounts; however, they can also be employed in exC6ss.<br>
The starting materials are generally reacted with one another in equimolar amounts. In terms of yield, it may be advantageous to employ an up to 10-fold exC6ss, in particular up to 3-fold exC6ss, of III, based on II.<br>
Compounds of the formula I in which R4 is hydrogen, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl or halo alkyl are advantageously obtained from phenylmalonic esters of the formula IV by reaction with maidens of the formula V.<br><br><br>
This reaction is advantageously carried out under the conditions known from J. Chem. Soc. (1943) 388 and J. Org. Chem. 17 (1952), 1320.<br>
Phenylmalonic esters of the formula IV are known from EP-A 10 02 788.<br>

The halopyrimidines VII give, by reaction with amines VIII, compounds of the formula I.<br><br>
This reaction is advantageously carried out under J. Chem. Soc. (1943) 383 and Chem. Eur. J. 5. (12) (1999), 3450-3458.<br>
Phenylpyrimidines of the formula I in which R5 is cyano or a group attached via oxygen are advantageously obtained from the corresponding halogen compounds of the formula I by reaction with compounds IX under basic conditions. For practical reasons, it is alternatively possible to employ directly the alkali metal, alkaline earth metal or ammonium salt of the compound IX.<br><br>
This reaction is usually carried out at	temperatures of from 25°c<br>
to 250°C, preferably from 40°c to 21O°C,	in an inert organic<br>
solvent, if appropriate in the presenC6	of a base [cf. Reel.<br>
Trav. Chim. Pays-Bas 61 (1942), 291; J.	Heterocycl. Chem. 30. (4)<br>
(1993), 993-995].<br><br>
 solvents are ethers, sulfoxides, amides, particularly preferably dimethyl sulfoxide, N,N-dimethylformamide, N-methylpyrrolidone, N,N-dimethylaC6tamide, diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and 1,2-dimethoxyethane. It is also possible to use mixtures of the solvents mentioned.<br>
Suitable bases are, in general, inorganic compounds, such as alkali metal and alkaline earth metal hydroxides, such as lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and calC1um hydroxide, alkali metal and alkaline earth metal hydrides, such as lithium hydride, sodium hydride, potassium hydride and calC1um hydride, and alkali metal and alkaline earth metal carbonates, such as lithium carbonate, potassium carbonate and calC1um carbonate.<br>
The bases are generally employed in catalytic amounts; however, they can also be employed in exC6ss.<br>
Phenylpyrimidines of the formula I in which R3 is C1-C6-alkyl or C1-C6-haloalkyl are advantageously obtained from the corresponding halogen compounds of the formula I by reaction with organometallic compounds of the formula X in which M is a group Mg-Hal, Zn-R3 or B(0R)2» where Hal is a halogen atom and R is hydrogen or C1-C4-alkyl and R3 is C1-C6-alkyl.<br><br>
This reaction is usually carried out at temperatures of from -25°C to 250°C, preferably from 0°C to 150°C, in an inert organic solvent, if appropriate in the presenC6 of a transition metal catalyst [volt. Chem. and Pharm. Bull. 28 (2) (1980), 571-577; Tetrahedron Lett. 32 (8) (1996), 1309; Tetrahedron Lett. 35. (19) (1994), 3155; Synlett 2 (1999), 1145].<br>
Suitable solvents are aliphatic hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons and ethers, particularly preferably diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, benzene, toluene and xylem. It is also possible to use mixtures of the solvents mentioned.<br><br>
Suitable transition metal catalysts are iron, cobalt, nickel, rhodium, platinum or palladium compounds, in particular nickel(O), nickel(II), palladium(O) and palladium(II) compounds. It is possible to use salts, such as palladium chloride or palladium acetate, or else Pd complexes. The only condition is that the palladium ligands can be replaced by the substrate under the reaction conditions.<br>
The starting materials are generally reacted with one another in equimolar amounts. In terms of yield, it may be advantageous to employ an up to 10-fold, in particular up to 3-fold, excess of X, based on I.<br>
The starting materials of the formula II required for preparing the compounds I can be obtained by methods known from the literature, for example by the following synthesis route:<br>
starting from phenylmalonic aC1d alkyl esters of the formula XI and thiourea, compounds of the formula XII are obtained<br><br>
where in formula XI R is C1-Cg-alkyl. The reaction is usually carried out in a protic solvent, such as, for example, an alcohol, in particular ethanol, if appropriate in the presence of a base such as Na2C03 or NaHCOa. The reaction temperature is preferably 70-220OC [cf. Collect. Czech. Chem. Commun. 4 (1983), 137-143; Heteroat. Chem. iJD (1999), 17-23; Czech. Chem. Commun. 58 (1993), 2215-2221].<br>
The required phenylmalonic aC1d esters XI are known from EP-A 10 02 788.<br>
Using alkylating agents XIII, compounds XII are converted into thiobarbituric aC1d derivatives. In the formula XIII, R is C1-C6-alkyl and X is a nucleophilically displaceable leaving group. Formula XIII represents, in a general manner, customary alkylating agents, such as methyl chloride and methyl bromide, dimethyl sulfate or methyl methanesulfonate.<br><br><br>
The reaction can be carried out in water or else in a dipolar aprotic solvent, such as, for example, N,N-dimnethylformainide [cf. US 5,250,689]; it is preferably carried out in the presence of a base, such as, for example, KOH, NaOH, NaHCOa and NaaCOa or pyridine. The reaction temperature is preferably IO-6OOC-<br>
Compounds XIV are converted into dichloropyrimidines of the formula XV [cf. EP-A 745 593; WO-A 99/32458; J.Org. Chem. 51 (1993), 3785-3786].<br><br>
Suitable chlorinating agents [C1] are, for example, POCl3, PC13/C12 or PCl5. The reaction can be carried out in excess chlorinating agent (POCl3) or in an inert solvent. This reaction is usually carried out at from 10 to150°c.<br>
By amination with XVI, the dichloro compounds of the formula XV are converted into the compounds of the formula XVII.<br><br>
This reaction is preferably carried out at from 20 to 120°c [cf. J. Chem. Res. S (7) (1995), 286-287; Liebigs Ann. Chem. (1995), 1703-1705] in an inert solvent, if appropriate in the presence of an auxiliary base, such as NaHCOs, Na2C°3 or tert.cunines.<br>
The amines of the formula XVI are commerC1ally available or known from the literature, or they can be prepared by known methods.<br><br>
The thio compounds XVII are oxidized to the sulfones of the formula II.<br>
i <br><br>
Compounds of the formula I in which R^ is -C(=0)NRaRb or -C (=NOR°) NRaRb are from the corresponding nitriles (R^ = cyano) by hydrolysis under aC1dic or basic conditions to give the carboxylic aC1ds of the formula la and amidation with eunines HNRaRtb. Hydrolysis is usually carried out in inert polar solvents, such as water or alcohols, preferably using inorganic bases, such as alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydroxides, in particular NaOH.<br><br><br>
These conversions are advantageously carried out under the conditions known from Chem. and Pharm. Bull. 30(12) (1982), 4314.<br>
Compounds of the formula I in which R4 is -C (=NORc) NRaRb are obtained from amides of the formula lb by oximation with substituted hydroxylamines H2N-ORC under basic conditions [cf. US 4,876,252]. The substituted hydroxylamines can be used as free base or, preferably, in the form of their aC1d addition salts. Particularly suitable are, for practical reasons, the halides, such as the chlorides, or the sulfates.<br><br>
Alternatively, the amidoximes of the formula Ic in which R* and R^ are hydrogen can also be obtained from the corresponding nitriles (R4 = cyano) by reaction with hydroxylamine and subsequent alkylation. This reaction is advantageously carried out under the conditions known from DE-A 198 37 794.<br>
Compounds of the formula I in which R"* is -C(=0)R
 <br>
This reaction is advantageously carried out under the conditions known from J. Heterocycl. Chem. 31(4) (1994), 1041.<br>
The substituents and indices in formulae la, lb and Ic correspond to those in formula I.<br>
Compounds of the formula I in which R^ is -C (=NNR3Rb) RC can be obtained via the carbonyl compounds Id. They are obtained by reacting Id with hydrazines H2NNRaRb, preferably under the conditions known from J. Org. Chem. 31 (1966), 677.<br><br>
Compounds of the formula I in which R^ is -C(=NOR*)Rc can be obtained by oximating carbonyl compounds Id. The oximation of Id is carried out analogously to the oximation of the compounds lb.<br>
The reaction mixtures are worked up in a customary manner, for example by mixing with water, separating the phases and, if appropriate, chromatographic purification of the crude products. Some of the intermediates and end products are obtained in the form of colorless or slightly brownish, viscous oils which can be purified or freed from volatile components under reduced pressure and at moderately elevated temperature. If the intermediates and end products can be obtained as solids, purification can also be carried out by recrystallization or digestion.<br>
If individual compounds I are not obtainable by the routes described above, they can be prepared by derivatization of other compounds I.<br>

The use forms depend entirely on the intended purposes; in any case, they are intended to guarantee the finest possible distribution of the active compounds according to the invention.<br>
Aqueous use forms can be prepared from emulsion concentrates, pastes or settable powders (sprayable powders, oil dispersions) by adding water. To prepare emulsions, pastes or oil dispersions, the substances as such or dissolved in an oil or solvent can be homogenized in water by means of wetter, testifier, dispersant or emulsifier. Alternatively, it is possible to prepare concentrates composed of active substance, wetter, testifier, dispersant or emulsifier and, if appropriate, solvent or oil, and such concentrates are suitable for dilution with water.<br>
The active compound concentrations in the ready-to-use preparations can be varied within substantial ranges. In general, they are from 0.0001 to 10%, preferably from 0.01 to 1%.<br>
The active compounds may also be used successfully in the ultra-low-volume process (ULV), it being possible to apply formulations comprising over 95% by weight of active compound, or even the active compound without additives.<br>
Various types of oils, herbicides, fungicides, other pesticides, or bactericides may be added to the active compounds, if appropriate also just prior to use (tank mix). These agents can be admixed with the agents according to the invention in a weight ratio of 1:10 to 10:1.<br>
In the use form as fungicides, the compositions according to the invention can also be present together with other active compounds, e.g. with herbicides, insecticides, growth regulators, fungicides or else with fertilizers. Mixing the compounds I or the compositions comprising them in the use form as fungicides with other fungicides frequently results in a broader fungicidal spectrum of action.<br>
