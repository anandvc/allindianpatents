Anti-Interferon Gamma Antibodies and Methods of Use Thereof<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to folly human anti-interferon gamma antibodies as<br>
well as to methods for use thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Human interferon gamma (IFNy, IFN-gamma) is a lymphokine produced by<br>
activated T-lymphocytes and natural killer cells. It manifests anti-proliferative, antiviral<br>
and irnrnunomodiilatory activities and binds to IFNy-R, a lieterodimeric receptor on most<br>
primary cells of the immune system, and niggers a cascade of events leading to<br>
inflammation. The antiviral and immunomodulatory activity of IFNy is known to have<br>
beneficial effects in a number of clinical conditions. However, there are many clinical<br>
settings in which IFNy-activity is known to have deleterious effects. For example,<br>
autoimmune diseases are associated with high levels of IFNy in the blood and diseased<br>
&gt; tissue from autoimmune patients. IFNy-activity has also been linked to such disease states<br>
as cachexia and septic shock.<br>
Accordingly, there exists a need for therapies that target IFNy activity.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention provides fully human monoclonal antibodies specific against<br>
interferon gamma (IFNy). The antibodies are collectively referred to herein is huIFNy<br>
antibodies.<br>
The huIFNy antibodies are, for example, IFNy antagonists or inhibitors that<br>
modulate at least one biological activity of IFNy. Biological activities of IFNy include, for<br>
example, binding the IFNy receptor (IFNy-R), modulating, e.g., reducing or inhibiting,<br>
major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II expression on a cell surface, and<br>
modulating, e.g., reducing or inhibiting, cell proliferation. For example, the huIFNy<br>
antibodies completely or partially inhibit IFNy activity by partially or completely blocking<br>
the binding of IFNy and the IFNy receptor (IFNy-R). The IFNy antibodies are considered to<br>
completely inhibit IFNy activity when the level of IFNy activity in the presence of the<br>
huIFNy antibody is decreased by at least 95%, e.g., by 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100% as<br>
compared to the level of IFNy activity in the absence of binding with a huIFNy antibody<br>
described herein. The IFNy antibodies are considered to partially inhibit IFNy activity<br>
when the level of IFNy activity in the presence of the huTFNy antibody is decreased by less<br>
than 95%, e.g., 10%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 75%, 80%, 85% or 90% as<br>
compared to the level of IFNy activity in the absence of binding with a huIFNy antibody<br>
described herein.<br>
10<br><br>
WO 2006/109191	PCT/IB2006/001514<br>
Additionally, the huIFNy antibodies of the invention inhibit IFNy-induced MHC<br>
class II expression on cells (see e.g., Examples 4 and 5). Preferably, the huIFNy antibodies<br>
exhibit greater than 50% inhibition of IFNy-induced MHC class II expression in the hitman<br>
melanoma cell line Me67.8 at a concentration of at least 0.02 nM. For example, the<br>
antibodies exhibit greater than 50% inhibition of IFNy-induced MHC class II expression in<br>
the Me67.8 cell line at a concentration in the range of 0.022 nM to 0.044 nM, eg., at a<br>
concentration of 0.022 nM, 0.028 nM or 0.044 nM.<br>
The huIFNy antibodies modulate an immune response in a subject, e.g., in a human<br>
subject. Preferably, the huIFNy antibodies modulate an adaptive immune response in a<br>
subject. More preferably, the huIFNy antibodies modulate the cellular or cell-mediated<br>
immune response, also known as Thl-type or Thl-mediated response.<br>
For example, the huIFNy antibodies described herein modulate, e.g., reduce, inhibit<br>
or prevent an exaggerated Thl-mediated immune response, such as an exaggerated Thl-<br>
mediated immune response associated with an autoimmune or inflammatory disorder such<br>
as, for example, Crohn's disease, system lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, sarcoidosis,<br>
Theumatoid arthritis, vasculitis, atopic dermatitis and secondary progressive multiple<br>
sclerosis. As used herein, the term "exaggerated" Thl-mediated immune response refers to<br>
the presence of an elevated level of Thl cytokine(s), such as IL-2, IL-3, TNF-alpha (TNFa)<br>
and IFNy, in a subject as compared to the level of Thl cytokine production in a subject not<br>
suffering from a disease or disorder associated with an exaggerated Thl immune response.<br>
To classify a Till -mediated immune response as an exaggerated response, the level of a Till<br>
cytokine production response is evaluated, e.g., by measuring and analyzing the level of<br>
secreted cytokines using an ELISA or other assay.<br>
The huIFNy antibodies described herein modulate, e.g., inhibit, reduce or prevent,<br>
class switching to an IgG isotype, such as IFNy-induced class switching. These huIFNy<br>
antibodies modulate, e.g., inhibit, prevent or reduce a Thl-mediated response and<br>
consequently decrease IFNy-induced switching.<br>
The huIFNy antibodies of the invention were produced by immunizing an animal<br>
with IFNy, such as, for example, murine or human IFNy (see e.g., Genbank Accession No.<br>
X13274) or an immunogenic fragment, derivative or variant thereof. Alternatively, the<br>
animal is immunized with cells transfected with a vector containing a nucleic acid molecule<br>
encoding IFNy, such that IFNy is expressed and associated with the surface of the<br>
11<br><br>
WO 2006/109191<br><br>
PCT/IB2006/001514<br><br>
transfected cells. Alternatively, the antibodies are obtained by screening a library that<br>
contains antibody or antigen binding domain sequences for binding to IFNy. This library is<br>
prepared, e.g., in bacteriophage as protein or peptide fusions to a bacteriophage coat protein<br>
that is expressed on the surface of assembled phage particles and the encoding DNA<br>
sequences contained within the phage particles (i.e., "phage displayed library").<br>
huIFNy antibodies of the invention include, for example, the heavy chain<br>
complementarity determining regions (CDRs) shown below in Table 1, the light chain<br>
CDRs shown in Table 2, and combinations thereof.<br>

Unless otherwise defined, scientific and technical terms used in connection with the<br>
present invention shall have the meanings that are commonly understood by those of<br>
ordinary skill in the art. Further, unless otherwise required by context, singular terms shall<br>
include pluralities and plural terms shall include the singular. Generally, nomenclatures<br>
utilized in connection with, and techniques of, cell and tissue culture, molecular biology,<br>
and protein and oligo- or polynucleotide chemistry and hybridization described herein are<br>
those well known and commonly used in the art. Standard techniques are used for<br>
recombinant DNA, oligonucleotide synthesis, and tissue culture and transformation (e.g.,<br>
electroporation, lipofection). Enzymatic reactions and purification techniques are<br>
performed according to manufacturer's specifications or as commonly accomplished in the<br>
art or as described herein. The foregoing techniques and procedures are generally<br>
performed according to conventional methods well known in the art and as described in<br>
various general and more specific references that are cited and discussed throughout the<br>
present specification. See e.g., Sambrook et at. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual<br>
(2d ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989)). The<br>
nomenclatures utilized in connection with, and the laboratory procedures and techniques of,<br>
analytical chemistry, synthetic organic chemistry, and medicinal and pharmaceutical<br>
chemistry described herein are those well known and commonly used in the art. Standard<br>
techniques are used for chemical syntheses, chemical analyses, pharmaceutical preparation,<br>
formulation, and delivery, and treatment of patients.<br>
As utilized in accordance with the present disclosure, the following terms, unless<br>
otherwise indicated, shall be understood to have the following meanings:<br>
As used herein, the term "antibody" refers to immunoglobulin molecules and<br>
immunologically active portions of immunoglobulin (Ig) molecules, i.e., molecules that<br>
contain an antigen binding site that specifically binds (immunoreacts with) an antigen.<br>
Such antibodies include, but are not limited to, polyclonal, monoclonal, chimeric, single<br>
chain, Fab, Fab and F(ab)2 fragments, and an Fab expression library. By "specifically bind" or<br>
"immunoreacts with" is meant that the antibody reacts with one or more antigenic<br>
19<br><br>
WO 2006/109191	PCT/1B2006/001514<br>
determinants of the desired antigen and does not react (i.e., bind) with other polypeptides or<br>
binds at much lower affinity (Kd &gt; 10'6) with other polypeptides.<br>
The basic antibody structural unit is known to comprise a tetramer. Each tetramer is<br>
composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one "light" (about<br>
25 kDa) and one "heavy" chain (about 50-70 kDa). The ammo-terminal portion of each<br>
chain includes a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids primarily<br>
responsible for antigen recognition. The carboxy-terminal portion of each chain defines a<br>
constant Tegion primarily responsible for effector function. Human light chains are<br>
classified as kappa and lambda light chains. Heavy chains are classified as mu, delta,<br>
gamma, alpha, or epsilon, and define the antibody's isotype as IgM, IgD, IgA, and IgE,<br>
respectively. Within light and heavy chains, the variable and constant regions are joined by<br>
a "J" region of about 12 or more amino acids, with the heavy chain also including a "D"<br>
region of about 10 more amino acids. See generally, Fundamental Immunology Ch. 7 (Paul,<br>
W., ea., 2nd ed. Raven Press, N.Y. (1989)). The variable regions of each light/heavy chain<br>
pair form the antibody binding site.<br>
The term "monoclonal antibody" (MAb) or "monoclonal antibody composition", as<br>
used herein, refers to a population of antibody molecules that contain only one molecular<br>
species of antibody molecule consisting of a unique light chain gene product and a unique<br>
heavy chain gene product. In particular, the complementarity determining regions (CDRs)<br>
of the monoclonal antibody are identical in all the molecules of the population. MAbs<br>
contain an antigen binding site capable of immunoreacting with a particular epitope of the<br>
antigen characterized by a unique binding affinity for it.<br>
In general, antibody molecules obtained from humans relate to any of the classes<br>
IgG, IgM, IgA, IgE and IgD, which differ from one another by the nature of the heavy chain<br>
present in the molecule. Certain classes have subclasses as well, such as IgG1 IgG2, and<br>
others. Furthermore, in humans, the light chain may be a kappa chain or a lambda chain.<br>
The term "antigen-binding site," or "binding portion" refers to the part of the<br>
immunoglobulin molecule that participates in antigen binding. The antigen binding site is<br>
formed by amino acid residues of the N-terminal variable ("V") regions of the heavy ("H")<br>
and light ("L") chains. Three highly divergent stretches within the V regions of the heavy<br>
and light chains, referred to as "hypervariable regions," are interposed between more<br>
conserved flanking stretches known as "framework regions," or "FRs". Thus, the term "FR"<br>
20<br><br>
WO 2006/109191	PCT/IB2006/001514<br>
refers to amino acid sequences which are naturally found between, and adjacent to,<br>
hypervariable regions in immunoglobulins. In an antibody molecule, the three hypervariable<br>
regions of a light chain and the three hypervariable regions of a heavy chain are disposed<br>
relative to each other in three dimensional space to form an antigen-binding surface. The<br>
antigen-binding surface is complementary to the three-dimensional surface of a bound<br>
antigen, and the three hypervariable regions of each of the heavy and light chains are<br>
referred to as "complementarity-determining regions," or "CDRs."  The assignment of<br>
amino acids to each domain is in accordance with the definitions of Kabat Sequences of<br>
Proteins of Immunological Interest (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1987 and<br>
1991)), or Chothia &amp;Lesk J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917 (1987), Chothia et al. Nature 342:878-<br>
883 (1989).<br>
As used herein, the term "epitope" includes any protein determinant capable of<br>
specific binding to an imrnunoglobulin, a scFv, or a T-cell Teceptor. The term "epitope"<br>
includes any protein determinant capable of specific binding to an immunoglobulin or T-<br>
cell receptor. Epitopic determinants usually consist of chemically active surface groupings<br>
of molecules such as amino acids or sugar side chains and usually have specific three<br>
dimensional structural characteristics, as well as specific charge characteristics. An<br>
antibody is said to specifically bind an antigen when the dissociation constant is 
preferably 
As used herein, the terms "immunological binding," and "immunological binding<br>
properties" refer to the non-covalent interactions of the type which occur between an<br>
immunoglobulin molecule and an antigen for which the immunoglobulin is specific. The<br>
strength, or affinity of immunological binding interactions can be expressed in terms of the<br>
dissociation constant (K
affinity. Immunological binding properties of selected polypeptides are quantified using<br>
methods well known in the art. One such method entails measuring the rates of antigen-<br>
binding site/antigen complex formation and dissociation, wherein those rates depend on the<br>
concentrations of the complex partners, the affinity of the interaction, and geometric<br>
parameters that equally influence the rate in both directions. Thus, both the "on rate<br>
constant" (Kon) and the "off rate constant" (Koff) can be determined by calculation of the<br>
concentrations and the actual rates of association and dissociation. {See Nature 361:186-87<br>
(1993)). The ratio of Koff/Kon enables the cancellation of all parameters not related to<br>
21<br><br>
WO 2006/109191	PCT/IB2006/001514<br>
affinity, and is equal to the dissociation constant Kd. {See, generally, Davies et al. (1990)<br>
Annual Rev Biochem 59:439-473). An antibody of the present invention is said to<br>
specifically bind to an IFNy epitope when the equilibrium binding constant (Kd) is :S1 mM,<br>
preferably 
pM, as measured by assays such as radioligand binding assays or similar assays known to<br>
those skilled in the art.<br>
Those skilled in the art will recognize that it is possible to determine, without undue<br>
experimentation, if a human monoclonal antibody has the same specificity as a hitman<br>
monoclonal antibody of the invention (e.g., monoclonal antibody NI-0501, A6, B4, B9, C9,<br>
C10, D3, D6, D8, El, F8, F9, G7, G9 or G10) by ascertaining whether the former prevents<br>
the latter from binding to a IFNy antigen polypeptide. If the human monoclonal antibody<br>
being tested competes with a human monoclonal antibody of the invention, as shown by a<br>
decrease in binding by the human monoclonal antibody of the invention, then the two<br>
monoclonal antibodies bind to the same, or a closely related, epitope. Another way to<br>
determine whether a human monoclonal antibody has the specificity of a human<br>
monoclonal antibody of the invention is to pre-incubate the human monoclonal antibody of<br>
the invention with the IFNy antigen polypeptide with which it is normally reactive, and then<br>
add the human monoclonal antibody being tested to determine if the human monoclonal<br>
antibody being tested is inhibited in its ability to bind the IFNy antigen polypeptide. If the<br>
human monoclonal antibody being tested is inhibited then, in all likelihood, it has the same, .<br>
or functionally equivalent, epitopic specificity as the monoclonal antibody of the invention.<br>
Various procedures known within the art aie used for the production of the<br>
monoclonal antibodies directed against a protein such as an IFNy protein, or against<br>
derivatives, fragments, analogs homologs or orthologs thereof. (See, e.g., Antibodies: A<br>
Laboratory Manual, Harlow E, and Lane D, 1988, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press,<br>
Cold Spring Harbor, NY, incorporated herein by reference). Fully human antibodies are<br>
antibody molecules in which the entire sequence of both the light chain and the heavy chain,<br>
including the CDRs, arise from human genes. Such antibodies are termed "human<br>
antibodies", or "fully human antibodies" herein. Human monoclonal antibodies are<br>
prepared, for example, using the procedures described in the Examples provided below.<br>
Human monoclonal antibodies can be also prepared by using trioma technique; the human<br>
B-cell hybridoma technique (see Kozbor, et al., 1983 Immunol Today 4: 72); and the EBV<br>
22<br><br>
WO 2006/109191	PCT/IB2006/001514<br>
hybridoma technique to produce human monoclonal antibodies (see Cole, et al., 1985 In:<br>
MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES AND CANCER THERAPY, Alan R. Liss, Inc., pp. 77-96). Human<br>
monoclonal antibodies may be utilized and may be produced by using human hybridomas<br>
(see Cote, et al., 1983. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 80: 2026-2030) or by transforming human<br>
B-cells with Epstein Barr Virus in vitro (see Cole, et al., 1985 In: MONOCLONAL<br>
ANTIBODIES AND CANCER THBRAPY, Alan R. Liss, Inc., pp. 77-96).<br>
Antibodies are purified by well-known techniques, such as affinity chromatography<br>
using protein A or protein G, which provide primarily the IgG fraction of immune serum.<br>
Subsequently, or alternatively, the specific antigen which is the target of the<br>
immunoglobulin sought, or an epitope thereof, may be immobilized on a column to purity<br>
the immune specific antibody by immunoaffinity chromatography. Purification of<br>
immunoglobulins is discussed, for example, by D. Wilkinson (The Scientist, published by<br>
The Scientist, Inc., Philadelphia PA, Vol. 14, No. 8 (April 17,2000), pp. 25-28).<br>
It is desirable to modify the antibody of the invention with respect to effector<br>
function, so as to enhance, e.g., the effectiveness of the antibody in treating immune-related<br>
diseases. For example, cysteine residue(s) can be introduced into the Fc region, thereby<br>
allowing interchain disulfide bond formation in this region. The homodimeric antibody<br>
thus generated can have improved intemalization capability and/or increased<br>
complement-mediated cell killing and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).<br>
(See Caron et al., J. Exp Med., 176:1191-1195 (1992) and Shopes, J. Immunol., 148:<br>
2918-2922 (1992)). Alternatively, an antibody can be engineered that has dual Fc regions<br>
and can thereby have enhanced complement lysis and ADCC capabilities. (See Stevenson<br>
et al., Anti-Cancer Drug Design, 3:219-230 (1989)).<br>
The invention also includes Fv, Fab, Fab" and F(ab')2 huIFNy fragments, single chain<br>
huIFNy antibodies, bispecific huIFNy antibodies and heteroconjugate huIFNy antibodies.<br>
Bispecific antibodies are antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two<br>
different antigens. In the present case, one of the binding specificities is for IFNy. The<br>
second binding target is any other antigen, and advantageously is a cell-surface protein or<br>
receptor or receptor subunit.<br>
Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditionally, the<br>
recombinant production of bispecific antibodies is based on the co-expression of two<br>
immunoglobulin heavy-chain/light-chain pairs, where the two heavy chains have different<br>
23<br><br>
WO 2006/109191	PCT/IB2006/001514<br>
specificities (Milstein and Cuello, Nature, 305:537-539 (1983)). Because of the random<br>
assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, these hybridomas (quadromas)<br>
produce a potential mixture often different antibody molecules, of which only one has the<br>
correct bispecific structure. The purification of the correct molecule is usually<br>
accomplished by affinity chromatography steps. Similar procedures are disclosed in WO<br>
93/08829, published 13 May 1993, and in Traunecker et al., EMBO J., 10:3655-3659<br>
(1991).<br>
Antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities (antibody-antigen<br>
combining sites) can be fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. The fusion<br>
preferably is with an immunoglobulin heavy-chain constant domain, comprising at least part<br>
of the hinge, CH2, and CH3 regions. It is preferred to have the first heavy-chain constant<br>
region (CHI) containing the site necessary for light-chain binding present in at least one of<br>
the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy-chain fusions and, if desired, the<br>
immunoglobulin light chain, are inserted into separate expression vectors, and are<br>
co-transfected into a suitable host organism. For further details of generating bispecific<br>
antibodies see, for example, Suresh et al., Methods in Enzymology, 121:210 (1986).<br>
According to another approach described in WO 96/27011, the interface between a<br>
pair of antibody molecules can be engineered to maximize the percentage of heterodimers<br>
which are recovered from recombinant cell culture. The preferred interface comprises at<br>
least a part of the CH3 region of an antibody constant domain. In this method, one or more<br>
small amino acid side chains from the interface of the first antibody molecule are replaced<br>
with larger side chains (e.g. tyrosine or tryptophan). Compensatory "cavities" of identical<br>
or similar size to the large side chain(s) are created on the interface of the second antibody<br>
molecule by replacing large amino acid side chains with smaller ones (e.g. alanine or<br>
threonine). This provides a mechanism for increasing the yield of the heterodimer over<br>
other unwanted end-products such as homodimers.<br>
Bispecific antibodies can be prepared as full length antibodies or antibody fragments<br>
(e.g. F(ab')2 bispecific antibodies). Techniques for generating bispecific antibodies from<br>
antibody fragments have been described in the literature. For example, bispecific antibodies<br>
can be prepared using chemical linkage. Brennan et al., Science 229:81 (1985) describe a<br>
procedure wherein intact antibodies are proteolytically cleaved to generate F(ab')2<br>
fragments. These fragments are reduced in the presence of the dithiiol complexing agent<br>
24<br><br>
WO 2006/109191	PCT/IB2006/OO1514<br>
sodium arsenite to stabilize vicinal dithiols and prevent intermolecular disulfide formation.<br>
The Fab' fragments generated are then converted to thionitrobenzoate (TNB) derivatives.<br>
One of the Fab'-tNB derivatives is then reconverted to the Fab'-thiol by reduction with<br>
mercaptoethylamine and is mixed with an equimolar amount of the other Fab'-TNB<br>
derivative to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibodies produced can be used<br>
as agents for the selective immobilization of enzymes.<br>
Additionally, Fab' fragments can be directly recovered from E. coli and chemically<br>
coupled to form bispecific antibodies. Shalaby et al., J. Exp. Med. 175:217-225 (1992)<br>
describe the production of a fully humanized bispecific antibody F(ab')2 molecule. Each<br>
Fab' fragment was separately secreted from E. coli and subjected to directed chemical<br>
coupling in vitro to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibody thus formed was<br>
able to bind to cells overexpressing the ErbB2 receptor and normal human T cells, as well<br>
as trigger the lytic activity of human cytotoxic lymphocytes against human breast tumor<br>
targets.<br>
Various techniques for making and isolating bispecific antibody fragments directly<br>
from recombinant cell culture have also been described. For example, bispecific antibodies<br>
have been produced using leucine zippers. Kostelny et al., J. Immunol. 148(5):1547-1553<br>
(1992). The leucine zipper peptides from the Fos and Jun proteins were linked to the Fab'<br>
portions of two different antibodies by gene fusion. The antibody homodimers were<br>
reduced at the hinge region to form monomers and then re-oxidized to form the antibody<br>
heterodimers. This method can also be utilized for the production of antibody homodimers.<br>
The "diabody" technology described by Hollinger et al., Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA<br>
90:6444-6448 (1993) has provided an alternative mechanism for making bispecific antibody<br>
fragments. The fragments comprise a heavy-chain variable domain (VH) connected to a<br>
light-chain variable domain (VL) by a linker which is too short to allow pairing between the<br>
two domains on the same chain. Accordingly, the VH and VL domains of one fragment are<br>
forced to pair with the complementary VL and VH domains of another fragment, thereby<br>
forming two antigen-binding sites. Another strategy for making bispecific antibody<br>
fragments by the use of single-chain Fv (sFv) dimers has also been reported. See, Gruber et<br>
al., J. Immunol. 152:5368 (1994).<br>
Antibodies with more than two valencies are contemplated. For example, trispecific<br>
antibodies can be prepared. Tutt et al., J. Immunol. 147:60 (1991).<br>
25<br><br>
WO 2006/109191	PCT/IB2006/001514<br>
Exemplary bispecific antibodies can bind to two different epitopes, at least one of<br>
which originates in the protein antigen of the invention. Alternatively, an anti-antigenic arm<br>
of an immunoglobulin molecule can be combined with an arm which binds to a triggering<br>
molecule on a leukocyte such as a T-cell receptor molecule (e.g. CD2, IFNy, CD28, or B7),<br>
or Fc receptors for IgG (FcyR), such as FcyRI (CD64), FcyRII (IFNy2) and FcyRllI (CD 16)<br>
so as to focus cellular defense mechanisms to the cell expressing the particular antigen.<br>
Bispecific antibodies can also be used to direct cytotoxic agents to cells which express a<br>
particular antigen. These antibodies possess an antigen-binding arm and an arm which<br>
binds a cytotoxic agent or a radionuclide chelator, such as EOTUBB, DPTA, DOTA, or<br>
TETA. Another bispecific antibody of interest binds the protein antigen described herein<br>
and further binds tissue factor (TF).<br>
Heteroconjugate antibodies are also within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Heteroconjvtgate antibodies are composed of two covalently joined antibodies. Such<br>
antibodies have, for example, been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted<br>
cells (U.S. Patent No. 4,676,980), and for treatment of fflV infection (WO 91/00360; WO<br>
92/200373; EP 03089). It is contemplated that the antibodies can be prepared in vitro using<br>
known methods in synthetic protein chemistry, including those involving crosslinking<br>
agents. For example, immunotoxins can be constructed using a disulfide exchange reaction<br>
or by forming a thioether bond. Examples of suitable reagents for this purpose include<br>
iminothiolate and methyl-4-mercaptobutyrimidate and those disclosed, for example, in U.S.<br>
Patent No. 4,676,980.<br>
The invention also pertains to immunoconjugates comprising an antibody<br>
conjugated to a cytotoxic agent such as a toxin (e.g., an enzymatically active toxin of<br>
bacterial, fungal, plant, or animal origin, or fragments thereof), or a radioactive isotope (i e.,<br>
a radioconjugate).<br>
Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof that can be used include<br>
diphtheria A chain, nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin, exotoxin A chain (from<br>
Pseudomonas aeruginosa), ricin A chain, abrin A chain, modeccin A chain, alpha-sarcin,<br>
Aleurites fordii proteins, dianthin proteins, Phytolaca americana proteins (PAPI, PAPII, and<br>
PAP-S), momordica charantia inhibitor, curcin, crotin, sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor,<br>
gelonin, mitogellin, restrictocin, phenomycin, enomycin, and the tricothecenes. A variety of<br>
26<br><br>
WO 2006/109191	PCT/IB2006/001514<br>
radionuclides are available for the production of radioconjugated antibodies. Examples<br>
include 212Bi,13V31In,9°Y, and I86Re.<br>
Conjugates of the antibody and cytotoxic agent are made using a variety of<br>
bifunctional protein-coupling agents such as N-succinirnidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithiol) propionate<br>
(SPDP), iminothiolane (IT), biftmctioiial derivatives of imidoesters (such as dimethyl<br>
adipimidate HCL), active esters (such as disuccinimidyl suberate), aldehydes (such as<br>
glutareldehyde), bis-azido compounds (such as bis (p-azidobenzoyl) hexanediamine),<br>
bis-diazonium derivatives (such as bis-(p-diazoniumbenzoyl)-ethy]enediamine),<br>
diisocyanates (such as tolyene 2,6-diisocyanate), and bis-active fluorine compounds (such<br>
as l,5-difluoro~2,4-dinitrobenzene). For example, a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as<br>
described in Vitetta et al., Science 238:1098 (1987). Carbon-14-labeled<br>
l-isothiocyanatobenzyl-3-methyldiethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (MX-DTPA) is an<br>
exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. (See<br>
WO94/11026).<br>
Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that a large variety of possible<br>
moieties can be coupled to the resultant antibodies or to other molecules of the invention.<br>
(See, for example, "Conjugate Vaccines", Contributions to Microbiology and Immunology,<br>
J. M. Cruse and R. E. Lewis, Jr (eds), Carger Press, New York, (1989), the entire contents<br>
of which are incorporated herein by reference).<br>
Coupling is accomplished by any chemical reaction that will bind the two molecules<br>
so long as the antibody and the other moiety retain their respective activities. This linkage<br>
can include many chemical mechanisms, for instance covalent binding, affinity binding,<br>
intercalation, coordinate binding and complexation. The preferred binding is, however,<br>
covalent binding. Covalent binding is achieved either by direct condensation of existing side<br>
chains or by the incorporation of external bridging molecules. Many bivalent or polyvalent<br>
linking agents are useful in coupling protein molecules, such as the antibodies of the present<br>
invention, to other molecules. For example, representative coupling agents can include<br>
organic compounds such as thioesters, carbodiimides, succinimide esters, diisocyanates,<br>
glutaraldehyde, diazobenzenes and hexametliylene diamines. This listing is not intended to<br>
be exhaustive of the various classes of coupling agents known in the art but, rather, is<br>
exemplary of the more common coupling agents. (See Killen and Lindstrom, Jour. Immun.<br>
133:1335-2549 (1984); Jansen et al., Immunological Reviews 62:185-216 (1982); and<br>

WO 2006/109191	PCT/IB2006/001514<br>
Vitetta et al., Science 238:1098 (1987). Preferred linkers are described in the literature.<br>
{See, for example, Ramakrishnan, S. et al., Cancer Res. 44:201-208 (1984) describing vise of<br>
MBS (M-maleimidoberizoyl-N-hydroxysuccrnimide ester). See also, U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,030,719, describing use of halogenated acetyl hydrazide derivative coupled to an antibody<br>
by way of an oligopeptide linker. Particularly preferred linkers include: (i) EDC (l-ethyl-3-<br>
(3-dirnethylamino-propyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride; (ii) SMPT (4-<br>
succimmidyloxycarbonyl-alpha-methyl-alpha-(2-pridyl-dithio)-toluene (Pierce Cbem. Co.,<br>
Cat. (21558G); (iii) SPDP (succinimidyl-6 [3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionamido] hexanoate<br>
(Pierce Chem. Co., Cat#21651G); (iv) Snlfo-LC-SPDP (sulfosuccinimidyl 6 [3-(2-<br>
pyridyldithio)-propianaraide] hexanoate (Pierce Chem. Co. Cat. #2165-G); and (v) sulfo-<br>
NHS (N-hydroxysulfo-succinimide: Pierce Chem. Co., Cat. #24510) conjugated to EDC.<br>
The linkers described above contain components that have different attributes, thus<br>
leading to conjugates with differing physio-chemical properties. For example, sulfo-NHS<br>
esters of alkyl carboxylates are more stable than sulfo-NHS esters of aromatic carboxylates.<br>
NHS-ester containing linkers are less soluble than sulfo-NHS esters. Further, the linker<br>
SMPT contains a sterically hindered disulfide bond, and can form conjugates with increased<br>
stability. Disulfide linkages, are in general, less stable than other linkages because the<br>
disulfide linkage is cleaved in vitro, resulting in less conjugate available. Sulfo-NHS, in<br>
particular, can enhance the stability of carbodimide couplings. Carbodimide couplings (such<br>
as EDC) when used in conjunction with sulfo-NHS, forms esters that are more resistant to<br>
hydrolysis than the carbodimide coupling reaction alone.<br>
The term "isolated polynucleotide" as used herein shall mean a polynucleotide of<br>
genomic, cDNA, or synthetic origin or some combination thereof, which by virtue of its<br>
origin the "isolated polynucleotide" (1) is not associated with all or a portion of a<br>
polynucleotide in which the "isolated polynucleotide" is found in nature, (2) is operably<br>
linked to a polynucleotide which it is not linked to in nature, or (3) does not occur in nature<br>
as part of a larger sequence.<br>
The term "isolated protein" referred to herein means a protein of cDNA,<br>
recombinant RNA, or synthetic origin or some combination thereof, which by virtue of its<br>
origin, or source of derivation, the "isolated protein" (1) is not associated with proteins<br>
found in nature, (2) is free of other proteins from the same source, e.g., free of marine<br>
proteins, (3) is expressed by a cell from a different species, or (4) does not occur in nature.<br>

The term "polypeptide" is used herein as a generic term to refer to native protein,<br>
fragments, or analogs of a polypeptide sequence. Hence, native protein fragments, and<br>
analogs are species of the polypeptide genus. Preferred polypeptides in accordance with the<br>
invention comprise the human heavy chain hnmunoglobulin molecules represented by<br>
Figures IB, 2B, 3B and 4B and the human light chain immunoglobulin molecules<br>
represented by Figures ID, 2D, 3D and 4D, as well as antibody molecules formed by<br>
combinations comprising the heavy chain immunoglobulin molecules with light chain<br>
immunoglobulin molecules, such as kappa light chain immunoglobulin molecules, and vice<br>
versa, as well as fragments and analogs thereof.<br>
The term "naturally-occurring" as used herein as applied to an object refers to the<br>
fact that an object can be found in nature. For example, a polypeptide or polynucleotide<br>
sequence that is present in an organism (including viruses) that can be isolated from a<br>
source in nature and which has not been intentionally modified by man in the laboratory or<br>
otherwise is naturally-occurring.<br>
The term "operably linked" as used herein Tefers to positions of components so<br>
described are in a relationship permitting them to function in their intended manner. A<br>
control sequence "operably linked" to a coding sequence is ligated in such a way that<br>
expression of the coding sequence is achieved under conditions compatible with the control<br>
sequences.<br>
The term "control sequence" as used herein refers to polynucleotide sequences<br>
which are necessary to effect the expression and processing of coding sequences to which<br>
they are ligated. The nature of such control sequences differs depending upon the host<br>
organism in prokaryotes, such control sequences generally include promoter, ribosomal<br>
binding site, and transcription termination sequence in eukaryotes, generally, such control<br>
sequences include promoters and transcription termination sequence. The term "control<br>
sequences" is intended to include, at a minimum, all components whose presence is<br>
essential for expression and processing, and can also include additional components whose<br>
presence is advantageous, for example, leader sequences and fusion partner sequences. The<br>
term "polynucleotide" as referred to herein means a polymeric boron of nucleotides of at<br>
least 10 bases in length, either ribonucleotides or deoxynucleotides or a modified form of<br>
either type of nucleotide. The term includes single and double stranded forms of DNA.<br>
29<br><br>
WO 2006/109191	PCT/IB2006/001514<br>
The term oligonucleotide referred to herein includes naturally occurring, and<br>
modified nucleotides linked together by naturally occurring, and non-naturally occurring<br>
oligonucleotide linkages. Oligonucleotides are a polynucleotide subset generally<br>
comprising a length of 200 bases or fewer. Preferably oligonucleotides are 10 to 60 bases in<br>
length and most preferably 12,13,14,15, 16,17,18, 19, or 20 to 40 bases in length.<br>
Oligonucleotides are usually single stranded, e.g., for probes, although oligonucleotides<br>
may be double stranded, e.g., for use in the construction of a gene mutant. Oligonucleotides<br>
of the invention are either sense or antisense oligomicleotides.<br>
The term "naturally occurring nucleotides" referred to herein includes<br>
deoxyribonucleotides and ribonucleotides. The term "modified nucleotides" referred to<br>
herein includes nucleotides with modified or substituted sugar groups and the like. The<br>
term "oligonucleotide linkages" referred to herein includes Oligonucleotides linkages such<br>
as phosphorothioate, phosphorodithioate, phosphoroselerloate, phosphorodiselenoate,<br>
phosphoroanilothioate, phoshoraniladate, phosphoronmidate, and the like. See e.g.,<br>

No. 5,151,510; Uhlmann and Peyman Chemical Reviews 90:543 (1990). An<br>
oligonucleotide can include a label for detection, if desired.<br>
The term "selectively hybridize" referred to herein means to detectably and<br>
specifically bind. Polynucleotides] oligonucleotides and fragments thereof in accordance<br>
with the invention selectively hybridize to nucleic acid strands under hybridization and<br>
wash conditions that minimize appreciable amounts of detectable binding to nonspecific<br>
nucleic acids. High stringency conditions can be used to achieve selective hybridization<br>
conditions as known in the art and discussed herein. Generally, the nucleic acid sequence<br>
homology between the polyuucleotides, oligonucleotides, and fragments of the invention<br>
and a nucleic acid sequence of interest will be at least 80%, and more typically with<br>
preferably increasing homologies of at least 85%, 90%, 95%, 99%, and 100%. Two amino<br>
acid sequences are homologous if there is a partial or complete identity between their<br>
sequences. For example, 85% homology means that 85% of the amino acids are identical<br>
when the two sequences are aligned for maximum matching. Gaps (in either of the two<br>
30<br><br>
WO 2006/109191	PCT/IB2006/001514<br>
sequences being matched) are allowed in maximizing matching gap lengths of 5 or less are<br>
preferred with 2 or less being more preferred. Alternatively and preferably, two protein<br>
sequences (or polypeptide sequences derived from them of at least 30 amino acids in length)<br>
are homologous, as this term is used herein, if they have an alignment score of at more than<br>
5 (in standard deviation units) using the program ALIGN with the mutation data matrix and<br>
a gap penalty of 6 or greater. See Dayhoff, M.O., in Atlas of Protein Sequence and<br>
Structure, pp. 101-110 (Volume 5, National Biomedical Research Foundation (1972)) and<br>
Supplement 2 to this volume, pp. 1-10. The two sequences or parts thereof are more<br>
preferably homologous if their amino acids are greater than or equal to 50% identical when<br>
optimally aligned using the ALIGN program. The term "corresponds to" is used herein to<br>
mean that a polynucleotide sequence is homologous (i.e., is identical, not strictly<br>
evolutionarily related) to all or a portion of a reference polynucleotide sequence, or that a<br>
polypeptide sequence is identical to a reference polypept'de sequence. In contradistinction,<br>
the term "complementary to" is used herein to mean that the complementary sequence is<br>
homologous to all or a portion of a reference polynucleotide sequence. For illustration, the<br>
nucleotide sequence "TATAC" corresponds to a reference sequence "TATAC" and is<br>
complementary to a reference sequence "GTATA".<br>
The following terms are used to describe the sequence relationships between two or<br>
more polynucleotide or amino acid sequences: "reference sequence", "comparison window",<br>
"sequence identity", "percentage of sequence identity", and "substantial identity". A<br>
"reference sequence" is a defined sequence used as a basis for a sequence comparison a<br>
reference sequence may be a subset of a larger sequence, for example, as a segment of a<br>
full-length cDNA or gene sequence given in a sequence listing or may comprise a complete<br>
cDNA or gene sequence. Generally, a reference sequence is at least 18 nucleotides or 6<br>
amino acids in length, frequently at least 24 nucleotides or 8 amino acids in length, and<br>
often at least 48 nucleotides or 16 amino acids in length. Since two polynucleotides or<br>
amino acid sequences may each (1) comprise a sequence (i.e., a portion of the complete<br>
polynucleotide or amino acid sequence) that is similar between the two molecules, and (2)<br>
may further comprise a sequence that is divergent between the two polynucleotides or<br>
amino acid sequences, sequence comparisons between two (or more) molecules are<br>
typically performed by comparing sequences of the two molecules over a "comparison<br>
window" to identify and compare local regions of sequence similarity. A "comparison<br>
31<br><br>
WO 2006/109191	PCT/IB2006/001514<br>
window", as used herein, refers to a conceptual segment of at least 18 contiguous nucleotide<br>
positions of 6 amino acids wherein a polynucleotide sequence or amino acid sequence may<br>
be compared to a reference sequence of at least 18 contiguous nucleotides or 6 amino acid<br>
sequences and wherein the portion of the polynucleotide sequence in the comparison<br>
window may comprise additions, deletions, substitutions, and the like (i.e., gaps) of 20<br>
percent or less as compared to the reference sequence (which does not comprise additions or<br>
deletions) for optimal alignment of the two sequences. Optimal alignment of sequences for<br>
aligning a comparison window may be conducted by the local homology algorithm of Smith<br>
and Waterman Adv. AppL Math. 2:482 (1981), by the homology alignment algorithm of<br>
Needleman and Wunsch J. Mol. Biol. 48:443 (1970), by the search for similarity method of<br>
Pearson and Lipman Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U.S.A.) 85:2444 (1988), by computerized<br>
implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the<br>
Wisconsin Genetics Software Package Release 7.0, (Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science<br>
Dr., Madison, Wis.), Geneworks, or Mac Vector software packages), or by inspection, and<br>
the best alignment (i.e., resulting in the highest percentage of homology over the<br>
comparison window) generated by the various methods is selected.<br>
The term "sequence identity" means that two polynucleotide or ammo acid<br>
sequences are identical (i.e., on a nucleotide-by-nucleotide or residue-by-residue basis) over<br>
the comparison window. The term "percentage of sequence identity" is calculated by<br>
comparing two optimally aligned sequences over the window of comparison, determining<br>
the number of positions at which the identical nucleic acid base (e.g., A, T, C, G, U or I) or<br>
residue occurs in both sequences to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the<br>
number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the comparison window<br>
(z. e., the window size), and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence<br>
identity. The terms "substantial identity" as used herein denotes a characteristic of a<br>
polynucleotide or amino acid sequence, wherein the polynucleotide or amino acid<br>
comprises a sequence that has at least 85 percent sequence identity, preferably at least 90 to<br>
95 percent sequence identity, more usually at least 99 percent sequence identity as<br>
compared to a reference sequence over a comparison window of at least 18 nucleotide (6<br>
amino acid) positions, frequently over a window of at least 24-48 nucleotide (8-16 amino<br>
acid) positions, wherein the percentage of sequence identity is calculated by comparing the<br>
reference sequence to the sequence which may include deletions or additions which total 20<br>
32<br><br>
WO 2006/109191	PCT/IB2006/001514<br>
percent or less of the reference sequence over the comparison window. The reference<br>
sequence may be a subset of a larger sequence.<br>
As used herein, the twenty conventional amino acids and their abbreviations follow<br>
conventional usage. See Immunology - A Synthesis (2nd Edition, E.S. Golub and D.R.<br>
Gren, Eds., Sinauer Associates, Sunderland Mass. (1991)). Stereoisomers (e.g., D- amino<br>
acids) of the twenty conventional amino acids, unnatural amino acids such as a-, a-<br>
disubstituted amino acids, N-alkyl amino acids, lactic acid, and other unconventional amino<br>
acids may also be suitable components for polypeptides of the present invention. Examples<br>
of unconventional amino acids include: 4 hydroxyproline, y-carboxyglutamate, e-N,N,N-<br>
trimethyllysine, e -N-acetyllysine, O-phosphoserine, N- acetylserine, N-formylmethionine,<br>
3-methylhistidine, 5-hydroxylysine, o-N-methylarginine, and other similar amino acids and<br>
imino acids (e.g., 4- hydroxyproline). In the polypeptide notation used herein, the lefthand<br>
direction is the amino terminal direction and the righthand direction is the carboxy-terminal<br>
direction, in accordance with standard usage and convention.<br>
Similarly, unless specified otherwise, the lefthand end of single- stranded<br>
polynucleotide sequences is the 5' end the lefthand direction of double-stranded<br>
polynucleotide sequences is referred to as the 51 direction. The direction of 5' to 3' addition<br>
of nascent RNA transcripts is referred to as the transcription direction sequence regions on<br>
the DNA strand having the same sequence as the RNA and which are 51 to the 5' end of the<br>
RNA transcript are referred to as "upstream sequences", sequence regions on the DNA<br>
strand having the same sequence as the RNA and which are 3' to the 3' end of the RNA<br>
transcript are referred to as "downstream sequences".<br>
As applied to polypeptides, the term "substantial identity" means that two peptide<br>
sequences, when optimally aligned, such as by the programs GAP or BESTFIT using<br>
default gap weights, share at least 80 percent sequence identity, preferably at least 90<br>
percent sequence identity, more preferably at least 95 percent sequence identity, and most<br>
preferably at least 99 percent sequence identity.<br>
Preferably, residue positions which are not identical differ by conservative amino<br>
acid substitutions.<br>
Conservative amino acid substitutions refer to the interchangeability of residues<br>
having similar side chains. For example, a group of amino acids having aliphatic side<br>
chains is glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, and isoleucine; a group of amino acids having<br>
33<br><br>
WO 2006/109191	PCT/IB2006/001514<br>
aliphatic-hydroxyl side chains is serine and threonine; a group of amino acids having amide-<br>
containing side chains is asparagine and glutamine; a group of amino acids having aromatic<br>
side chains is phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan; a group of amino acids having basic<br>
side chains is lysine, arginine, and histidine; and a group of amino acids having sulfur-<br>
containing side chains is cysteine and methionine. Preferred conservative amino acids<br>
substitution groups are: valine-leucine-isoleucine, phenylalanine-tyrosine, lysine-arginine,<br>
alanine valine, glutamic- aspartic, and asparagine-glutamine.<br>
As discussed herein, minor variations in the amino acid sequences of antibodies or<br>
immunoglobulin molecules are contemplated as being encompassed by the present<br>
invention, providing that the variations in the amino acid sequence maintain at least 75%,<br>
more preferably at least 80%, 90%, 95%, and most preferably 99%. In particular,<br>
conservative amino acid replacements are contemplated. Conservative replacements are<br>
. those that take place within a family of amino acids that are related in their side chains.<br>
Genetically encoded amino acids are generally divided into families: (1) acidic amino acids<br>
are aspartate, glutamate; (2) basic amino acids are lysine, arginine, histidine; (3) non-polar<br>
amino acids are alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine,<br>
tryptophan, and (4) uncharged polar amino acids are glycine, asparagine, glutamine,<br>
cysteine, serine, threonine, tyrosine. The hydrophilic amino acids include arginine,<br>
asparagine, aspartate, glutamine, glutamate, histidine, lysine, serine, and threonine. The<br>
hydrophobic amino acids include alanine, cysteine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine,<br>
phenylalanine, proline, tryptophan, tyrosine and valine. Other families of amino acids<br>
include (i) serine and threonine, which are the aliphatic-hydroxy family; (ii) asparagine and<br>
glutamine, which are the amide containing family; (iii) alanine, valine, leucine and<br>
isoleucine, which are the aliphatic family; and (iv) phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine,<br>
which are the aromatic family. For example, it is reasonable to expect that an isolated<br>
replacement of a leucine with an isoleucine or valine, an aspartate with a glutamate, a<br>
threonine with a serine, or a similar replacement of an amino acid with a structurally related<br>
amino acid will not have a major effect on the binding or properties of the resulting<br>
molecule, especially if the replacement does not involve an amino acid within a framework<br>
site. Whether an amino acid change results in a functional peptide can readily be<br>
determined by assaying the specific activity of the polypeptide derivative. Assays are<br>
described in detail herein. Fragments or analogs of antibodies or immunoglobulin<br>
34<br><br>
WO 2006/109191	PCT/IB2006/001514<br>
molecules can be readily prepared by those of ordinary skill in the art. Preferred ammo- and<br>
carboxy-termini of fragments or analogs occur near boundaries of functional domains.<br>
Structural and functional domains can be identified by comparison of the nucleotide and/or<br>
amino acid sequence data to public or proprietary sequence databases. Preferably,<br>
computerized comparison methods are used to identify sequence motifs or predicted protein<br>
conformation domains that OCCUT in other proteins of known structure and/or function.<br>
Methods to identify protein sequences that fold into a known three-dimensional structure<br>
are known. Bowies a/. Science 253:164 (1991). Thus, the foregoing examples<br>
demonstrate that those of skill in the art can recognize sequence motifs and structural .<br>
conformations that may be used to define structural and functional domains in accordance<br>
with the invention.<br>
Preferred amino acid substitutions are those which: (1) reduce susceptibility to<br>
proteolysis, (2) reduce susceptibility to oxidation, (3) alter binding affinity for forming<br>
protein complexes, (4) alter binding affinities, and (4) confer or modify other<br>
pbysicochemical or functional properties of such analogs. Analogs can include various<br>
muteins of a sequence other than the naturally-occurring peptide sequence. For example,<br>
single or multiple amino acid substitutions (preferably conservative amino acid<br>
substitutions) may be made in the naturally- occurring sequence (preferably in the portion of<br>
the polypeptide outside the domain(s) forming intermolecular contacts. A conservative<br>
amino acid substitution should not substantially change the structural characteristics of the<br>
parent sequence (e.g., a replacement amino acid should not tend to break a helix that occurs<br>
in tiie parent sequence, or disrupt other types of secondary structure that characterizes the<br>
parent sequence). Examples of art-recognized polypeptide secondary and tertiary structures<br>
are described in Proteins, Structures and Molecular Principles (Creighton, Ed., W. H.<br>
Freeman and Company, New York (1984)); Introduction to Protein Structure (C. Branden<br>
and J. Tooze, eds., Garland Publishing, New York, N.Y. (1991)); and Thornton et at<br>
Nature 354:105 (1991).<br>
The term "polypeptide fragment" as used herein refers to a polypeptide that has an<br>
amino terminal and/or carboxy-terminal deletion, but where the remaining amino acid<br>
sequence is identical to the corresponding positions in the naturally-occurring sequence<br>
deduced, for example, from a full length cDNA sequence. Fragments typically are at least<br>
5, 6, 8 or 10 amino acids long, preferably at least 14 amino acids long1 more preferably at<br>
35<br><br>
WO 2006/109191	PCT/IB2006/001514<br>
least 20 amino acids long, usually at least 50 ammo acids long, and even more preferably at<br>
least 70 amino acids long. The term "analog" as used herein refers to polypeptides which<br>
are comprised of a segment of at least 25 amino acids that has substantial identity to a<br>
portion of a deduced amino acid sequence and which has at least one of the following<br>
properties: (1) specific binding to IFNy, under suitable binding conditions, (2) ability to<br>
block appropriate IFNy binding, or (3) ability to inhibit IFNy-expressing cell growth in vitro<br>
or in vivo. Typically, polypeptide analogs comprise a conservative amino acid substitution<br>
(or addition or deletion) with respect to the naturally- occurring sequence. Analogs<br>
typically are at least 20 amino acids long, preferably at least 50 amino acids long or longer,<br>
and can often be as long as a full-length naturally-occurring polypeptide.<br>
Peptide analogs are commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry as non-peptide<br>
drugs with properties analogous to those of the template peptide. These types of non-<br>
peptide compound are termed "peptide mimetics" or "peptidomimetics". Fauchere, J. Adv.<br>
Drug Res. 15:29 (1986), Veber and Freidinger TINS p.392 (1985); and Evans et al. J. Med.<br>
Chem. 30:1229 (1987). Such compounds are often developed with the aid of computerized<br>
molecular modeling. Peptide mimetics that are structurally similar to therapeutically useful<br>
peptides may be used to produce an equivalent therapeutic or prophylactic effect.<br>
Generally, peptidomimetics are structurally similar to a paradigm polypeptide (i.e, a<br>
polypeptide that has a biochemical property or pharmacological activity), such as human .<br>
antibody, but have one or more peptide linkages optionally replaced by a linkage selected<br>
from the group consisting of: - CH2NH-, ~CH2S-, -CH2-CH2-, -CH=CH~(cis and<br>
trans), ~COCH2--, CH(OH)CH2~, and -CH2SO~, by methods well known in the art.<br>
Systematic substitution of one or more amino acids of a consensus sequence with a D-<br>
amino acid of the same type (e.g., D-lysine in place of L-lysine) may be used to generate<br>
more stable peptides. In addition, constrained peptides comprising a consensus sequence or<br>
a substantially identical consensus sequence variation may be generated by methods known<br>
in the art (Rizo and Gierasch Ann. Rev. Biochem. 61:387 (1992)); for example, by adding<br>
internal cysteine residues capable of forming intramolecular disulfide bridges which cyclize<br>
the peptide.<br>
The term "agent" is used herein to denote a chemical compound, a mixture of<br>
chemical compounds, a biological macromolecule, or an extract made from biological<br>
materials.<br>
36<br><br>
WO 2006/109191	PCT/IB2006/001514<br>
As used herein, the terms "label" or "labeled" refers to incorporation of a detectable<br>
marker, e.g., by incorporation of a radiolabeled amino acid or attachment to a polypeptide<br>
of biorinyl moieties that can be detected by marked avidin (e.g., streptavidin containing a<br>
fluorescent marker or enzymatic activity that can be detected by optical or calorimetric<br>
methods). In certain situations, the label or marker can also be therapeutic. Various<br>
methods of labeling polypeptides and glycoproteins are known in the art and may be used.<br>
Examples of labels for polypeptides include, but are not limited to, the following:<br>
radioisotopes or radionuclides (e.g., 3H, I4C, 15N, 35S, 90Y, 99Tc, 111ln, 1251,131I), fluorescent<br>
labels (e.g., FITC, rhodarnine, lanthanide phosphors), enzymatic labels (e.g., horseradish<br>
peroxidase, p-galactosidase, luciferase, alkaline phosphatase), chemiluminescent, biorinyl<br>
groups, predetermined polypeptide epitopes recognized by a secondary reporter (e.g.,<br>
leucine zipper pair sequences, binding sites for secondary antibodies, metal binding<br>
domains, epitope tags). In some embodiments, labels are attached by spacer arms of various<br>
lengths to reduce potential steric hindrance. The term "pharmaceutical agent or drug" as<br>
used herein refers to a chemical compound or composition capable of inducing a desired<br>
therapeutic effect when properly administered to a patient.<br>
Other chemistry terms herein are used according to conventional usage in the art, as<br>
exemplified by The McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Chemical Terms (Parker, S., Ed., McGraw-<br>
Hill, San Francisco (1985)).<br>
The term "antineoplastic agent" is used herein to refer to agents that have the<br>
functional property of inhibiting a development or progression of a neoplasm in a human,<br>
particularly a malignant (cancerous) lesion, such as a carcinoma, sarcoma, lymphoma, or<br>
leukemia. Inhibition of metastasis is frequently a property of antineoplastic agents.<br>
As used herein, "substantially pure" means an object species is the predominant<br>
species present (i.e., on a molar basis it is more abundant than any other individual species<br>
in the composition), and preferably a substantially purified fraction is a composition<br>
wherein the object species comprises at least about 50 percent (on a molar basis) of all<br>
macromolecular species present.<br>
Generally, a substantially pure composition will comprise more than about 80<br>
percent of all macromolecular species present in the composition, more preferably more<br>
than about 85%, 90%, 95%, and 99%. Most preferably, the object species is purified to<br>
essential homogeneity (contaminant species cannot be detected in the composition by<br>
37<br><br>
WO 2006/109191	PCT/IB2006/001514<br>
conventional detection methods) wherein the composition consists essentially of a single<br>
macromolecular species.<br>
The term patient includes human and veterinary subjects. The term subject includes<br>
humans and other mammals.<br>
Human Antibodies and Humanization of Antibodies<br>
A huIFNy antibody is generated, for example, using the procedures described in the<br>
Examples provided below. An IgG hulFNy antibody is generated, for example, by .<br>
converting a scFv clone an IgG format (see e.g., Example 6). Alternatively, such a huTFNy<br>
antibody is developed, for example, using phase-display methods using antibodies<br>
containing only human sequences. Such approaches are well-known in the art, e.g., in<br>
WO92/01047 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,521,404, which are hereby incorporated by reference. In<br>
this approach, a combinatorial library of phage carrying random pairs of light and heavy<br>
chains are screened using natural or recombinant source of IFNy or fragments thereof.<br>
A huIFNy antibody is produced by a process wherein at least one step of the process<br>
includes immunizing a transgenic, non-human animal with human IFNy protein. Some of<br>
the endogenous heavy and/or kappa light chain loci of this xenogenic non-human animal<br>
have been disabled and are incapable of the rearrangement required to generate genes<br>
encoding immunoglobulins in response to an antigen. In addition, at least one human heavy<br>
chain locus and at least one human light chain locus have been stably transfected into the<br>
animal. Thus, in response to an administered antigen, the human loci rearrange to provide<br>
genes encoding human variable regions immunospecific for the antigen. Upon<br>
immunization, therefore, the xenomouse produces B-cells that secrete fully human<br>
immunoglobulins.<br>
A variety of techniques are well-known in the art for producing xenogenic non-<br>
human animals. For example, see U.S. Pat. No. 6,075,181 and No. 6,150,584. By one<br>
strategy, the xenogeneic (human) heavy and light chain immunoglobulin genes are<br>
introduced into the host germ line (e.g., sperm or oocytes) and, in separate steps, the<br>
corresponding host genes are rendered non-functional by inactivation using homologous<br>
recombination. Human heavy and light chain immunoglobulm genes are reconstructed in<br>
an appropriate eukaryotic or prokaryotic microorganism, and the resulting DNA fragments<br>
are introduced into the appropriate host, for example, the pronuclei of fertilized mouse<br>
38<br><br>
WO 2006/109191	PCT/IB2006/001514<br>
oocytes or embryonic stem cells. Inactivation of the endogenous host immunoglobulin loci<br>
is achieved by targeted disruption of the appropriate loci by homologous recombination in<br>
the host cells, particularly embryonic stem cells or pronuclei of fertilized mouse oocytes.<br>
The targeted disruption can involve introduction of a lesion or deletion in the target locus,<br>
or deletion within the target locus accompanied by insertion into the locus, e.g., insertion of<br>
a selectable marker, in the case of embryonic stem cells, chimeric animals are generated<br>
which are derived in part from the modified embryonic stem cells and are capable of<br>
transmitting the genetic modifications through the germ line. The mating of hosts with<br>
introduced human immunoglobulin loci to strains with inactivated endogenous loci will<br>
yield animals whose antibody production is purely xenogeneic, e.g., human.<br>
In an alternative strategy, at least portions of the human heavy and light chain<br>
immunoglobulin loci are used to replace directly the corresponding endogenous<br>
immunoglobulin loci by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. This results in<br>
simultaneous inactivation and replacement of the endogenous immunoglobulin. This is<br>
followed by the generation of chimeric animals in which the embryonic stem cell-derived<br>
cells can contribute to the germ lines.<br>
For example, a B cell clone that expresses human anti-IFNy antibody is removed<br>
from the xenogenic non-human animal and immortalized according to various methods<br>
known within the art. Such B cells may be derived directly from the blood of the animal or<br>
from lymphoid tissues, including but not restricted to spleen, tonsils, lymph nodes, and bone<br>
marrow. The resultant, immortalized B cells may be expanded and cultured in vitro to<br>
produce large, clinically applicable quantities of huIFNy antibody. Alternatively, genes<br>
encoding the immunoglobulins with one or more human variable regions can be recovered<br>
and expressed in a differing cell type, including but not restricted to a mammalian cell<br>
culture system, in order to obtain the antibodies directly or individual chains thereof,<br>
composed of single chain Fv molecules.<br>
In addition, the entire set of fully human anti-IFNy antibodies generated by the<br>
xenogenic non-human animal may be screened to identify one such clone with the optimal<br>
characteristics. Such characteristics include, for example, binding affinity to the human<br>
IFNy protein, stability of the interaction as well as the isotype of the fully human anti-IFNy<br>
antibody. Clones from the entire set which have the desired characteristics men are used as<br>
a source of nucleotide sequences encoding the desired variable regions, for further<br>

manipulation to generate antibodies with the-se characteristics, in alternative cell systems,<br>
using conventional recombinant or transgenic techniques.<br>
This general strategy was demonstrated in connection with generation of the first<br>
XenoMouse™ strains as published in 1994. See Green et al. Nature Genetics 7:13-21<br>
(1994). This approach is further discussed and delineated in U.S. Patent Application Serial<br>

In an alternative approach, others have utilized a "minilocus" approach. In the<br>
minilocus approach, an exogenous Ig locus is mimicked through the inclusion of pieces<br>
(individual genes) from the Ig locus. Thus, one or more VH genes, one or more DH genes,<br>
one or more JH genes, a mu constant region, and a second constant region (preferably a<br>
gamma constant Tegion) are formed into a construct for insertion into an animal. This<br>
approach is described in U.S. Patent No. 5,545,807 to Surani et al and U.S. Patent Nos.<br>

An advantage of the minilocus approach is the rapidity with which constructs<br>
including portions of the Ig locus can be generated and introduced into animals.<br>
Commensurately, however, a significant disadvantage of the minilocus approach is that, in<br>
theory, insufficient diversity is introduced through the inclusion of small numbers of V, D,<br>
and J genes. Indeed, the published work appears to support tins concern. B-cell<br>
development and antibody production of animals produced through use of the minilocus<br>
approach appear stunted. Therefore, research surrounding the present invention has<br>
consistently been directed towards the introduction of large portions of the Ig locus in order<br>
to achieve greater diversity and in an effort to reconstitute the immune repertoire of the<br>
animals.<br>
Generation of human antibodies from mice in which, through microcell fusion, large<br>
pieces of chromosomes, or entire chromosomes, have been introduced, has also been<br>
demonstrated. See European Patent Application Nos. 773 288 and 843 961.<br>
Human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) responses have led the industry to prepare<br>
chimeric or otherwise humanized antibodies. While chimeric antibodies have a human<br>
constant region and a immune variable region, it is expected that certain human anti-<br>
chimeric antibody (HACA) responses will be observed, particularly in chronic or multi-dose<br>
utilizations of the antibody. Thus, it would be desirable to provide fully human antibodies<br>
against IFNy in order to vitiate concerns and/or effects of HAMA or HACA response.<br>
The production of antibodies with reduced immunogenicity is also accomplished via<br>
humanization and display techniques using appropriate libraries. It will be appreciated that<br>
murine antibodies or antibodies from other species can be humanized or primatized using<br>
techniques well known in the art. See e.g., Winter and Harris Immunol Today 14:43 46<br>
41<br><br>
WO 2006/109191	PCMB2006/001514<br>
(1993) and Wright et al. Crit, Reviews in Immunol. 12125-168 (1992). The antibody of<br>
interest may be engineered by recombinant DNA techniques to substitute the CHI, CH2,<br>
CH3, hinge domains, and/or the framework domain with the corresponding human sequence<br>
{See WO 92102190 and U.S. Patent Nos. 5,530,101, 5,585,089, 5,693,761, 5,693,792,<br>
5,714,350, and 5,777,085). Also, the use of Ig cDNA for construction of chrmeric<br>
imrnunoglobulin genes is known in the art (Liu et al. P.N.A.S. 84:3439 (1987) and J.<br>
Immunol. 139:3521 (1987)). mRNA is isolated from a hybridoma or other cell producing<br>
the antibody and used to produce cDNA. The cDNA of interest may be amplified by the<br>
polymerase chain reaction using specific primers (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,683,195 and 4,683,202).<br>
Alternatively, a library is made and screened to isolate the sequence of interest. The DNA<br>
sequence encoding the variable region of the antibody is then fused to human constant<br>
region sequences. The sequences of human constant regions genes may be found in Kabat<br>
et al. (1991) Sequences of Proteins of immunological Interest, N.I.H. publication no. 91-<br>
3242. Human C region genes are readily available from known clones. The choice of<br>
isotype will be guided by the desired effecter functions, such as complement fixation, or<br>
activity in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Preferred isotypes are IgGl, IgG3 and<br>
IgG4. Either of the human light chain constant regions, kappa or lambda, may be used. The<br>
chimeric, humanized antibody is then expressed by conventional methods.<br>
Antibody fragments, such as Fv, F(ab')2 and Fab may be prepared by cleavage of the<br>
intact protein, e.g., by protease or chemical cleavage. Alternatively, a truncated gene is<br>
designed. For example, a chimeric gene encoding a portion of the F(ab')2 fragment would<br>
include DNA sequences encoding the CHI domain and hinge region of the H chain,<br>
followed by a translational stop codon to yield the truncated molecule.<br>
Consensus sequences of H and L J regions may be used to design oligonucleotides<br>
for use as priers to introduce useful restriction sites into the J region for subsequent linkage<br>
of V region segments to human C region segments. C region cDNA can be modified by site<br>
directed mutagenesis to place a restriction site at the analogous position in the human<br>
sequence.<br>
Expression vectors include plasmids, retrovinises, YACs, EBV derived episomes,<br>
and the like. A convenient vector is one that encodes a functionally complete human CH or<br>
CL immunoglobulin sequence, with appropriate restriction sites engineered so that any VH<br>
or VL -31 sequence can be easily inserted and expressed. In such vectors, splicing usually<br>
42<br><br>
WO 2006/109191	PCT/IB2006/001514<br>
occurs between the splice donor site in the inserted J region and the splice acceptor site<br>
preceding the human C region, and also at the splice regions that occur within the human<br>
CH exons. Polyadenylation and transcription termination occur at native chromosomal sites<br>
downstream of the coding regions. The resulting chimeric antibody may be joined to any<br>
strong promoter, including retroviral LTRs, e.g., SV-40 early promoter, (Okayama et al.<br>
Mol. Cell. Bio. 3:280 (1983)), Rous sarcoma virus LTR (Gorman et al. P.N.A.S. 79:6777<br>
(1982)), and moloney murine leukemia virus LTR (Grosschedl et al. Cell 41:885 (1985)).<br>
Also, as will be appreciated, native Ig promoters and the like may be used.<br>
Further, human antibodies or antibodies from other species can be generated through<br>
display type technologies, including, without limitation, phage display, retroviral display,<br>
ribosomal display, and other techniques, using techniques well known in the art and the<br>
resulting molecules can be subjected to additional maturation, such as affinity maturation,<br>
as such techniques are well known in the art. Wright and Harris, supra., Hanes and<br>

TIBTECH; 10-.80-8A (1992), and U.S. Patent No. 5,733,743. If display technologies are<br>
utilized to produce antibodies that are not human, such antibodies can be humanized as<br>
described above.<br>
Using these techniques, antibodies can be generated to IFNy expressing cells, lFNy<br>
itself, forms of IFNy, epitopes or peptides thereof, and expression libraries thereto {See e.g.,<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,703,057) which can thereafter be screened as described above for the<br>
activities described above.<br>
Design and Generation of Other Therapeutics    *<br>
In accordance with the present invention and based on the activity of the antibodies<br>
that are produced and characterized herein with respect to IFNy, the design of other<br>
therapeutic modalities beyond antibody moieties is facilitated. Such modalities include,<br>
without limitation, advanced antibody therapeutics, such as bispecific antibodies,<br>
immunotoxins, and radiolabeled therapeutics, generation of peptide therapeutics, gene<br>
therapies, particularly intrabodies, antisense therapeutics, and small molecules.<br>
43<br><br>
WO 2006/109191	PCT/IB2006/001514<br>
For example, in connection with bispecific antibodies, bispecific antibodies can be<br>
generated that comprise (i) two antibodies one with a specificity to IFNy and another to a<br>
second molecule that are conjugated together, (ii) a single antibody that has one chain<br>
specific to IFNy and a second chain specific to a second molecule, or (iii) a single chain<br>
antibody that has specificity to IFNy and the other molecule. Such bispecific antibodies are<br>
generated using techniques that are well known for example, in connection with (i) and (ii)<br>
See e.g., Fanger et al. Immunol Methods 4:72-81 (1994) and Wright and Harris, supra, and<br>
in connection with (iii) See e.g., Traunecker et al. Int. J. Cancer (Suppl.) 7:51-52 (1992).<br>
In connection with immunotoxins, antibodies can be modified to act as<br>
immunotoxins utilizing techniques that are well known in the art See e.g., Vitetta Immunol<br>
Today 14:252 (1993). See also U.S. Patent No. 5,194,594. In connection with the<br>
preparation of Tadiolabeled antibodies, such modified antibodies can also be readily<br>
prepared utilizing techniques that are well known in the art See e.g., Junghans et al. in<br>
Cancer Chemotherapy and Biotherapy 655-686 (2d edition, Chaiher and Longo, eds.,<br>
Lippincott Raven (1996)). See also U.S. Patent Nos. 4,681,581,4,735,210,<br>
5,101,827,5,102,990 (RE 35,500), 5, 648,471, and 5,697,902. Each of immunotoxins and<br>
radiolabeled molecules would be likely to kill cells expressing IFNy, and particularly those<br>
cells in which the antibodies of the invention are effective.<br>
hi connection with the generation of therapeutic peptides, through the utilization of<br>
structural information related to IFNy and antibodies thereto, such as the antibodies of the<br>
invention or screening of peptide libraries, therapeutic peptides can be generated that are<br>
directed against IFNy. Design and screening of peptide therapeutics is discussed in<br>
connection with Houghten et al. Biotechniques 13:412-421 (1992), HoughtenPNAS USA<br>
82:5131-5135 (1985), Pinalla et al. Biotechniques 13:901-905 (1992), Blake and Lhzi-<br>
Davis BioConjugate Chem. 3:510-513 (1992). Immunotoxins and radiolabeled molecules<br>
can also be prepared, and in a similar manner, in connection with peptidic moieties as<br>
discussed above in connection with antibodies. Assuming that the IFNy molecule (or a<br>
form, such as a splice variant or alternate form) is functionally active in a disease process, it<br>
will also be possible to design gene and antisense therapeutics thereto through conventional<br>
techniques. Such modalities can be utilized for modulating the function of IFNy. In<br>
connection therewith the antibodies of the present invention facilitate design and use of<br>
functional assays related thereto. A design and strategy for antisense therapeutics is<br>
44<br><br>
WO 2006/109191	PCT/IB2006/001514<br>
discussed in detail in Internationa] Patent Application No. WO 94/29444. Design and<br>
strategies for gene therapy are well known. However, in particular, the use of gene<br>
therapeutic techniques involving intrabodies could prove to be particularly advantageous.<br>
See e.g., Chen et al. Human Gene Therapy 5:595-601 (1994) and Marasco Gene Therapy<br>
4:11-15 (1997). General design of and considerations related to gene therapeutics is also<br>
discussed in International Patent Application No. WO 97/38137.<br>
Knowledge gleaned from the structure of the IFNy molecule and its interactions with<br>
other molecules in accordance with the present invention, such as the antibodies of the<br>
invention, and others can be utilized to rationally design additional therapeutic modalities.<br>
In this regard, rational drug design techniques such as X-ray crystallography, computer-<br>
aided (or assisted) molecular modeling (CAMM), quantitative or qualitative structure-<br>
activity relationship (QSAR), and similar technologies can be utilized to focus drug<br>
discovery efforts. Rational design allows prediction of protein or synthetic structures which<br>
can interact with the molecule or specific forms thereof which can be used to modify or<br>
modulate the activity of IFNy. Such structures can be synthesized chemically or expressed<br>
in biological systems. This approach has been reviewed in Capsey et al. Genetically<br>
Engineered Human Therapeutic Drugs (Stockton Press, NY (1988)). Further, combinatorial<br>
libraries can be designed and synthesized and used in screening programs, such as high<br>
throughput screening efforts.<br>
Therapeutic Administration and Formulations<br>
It will be appreciated that administration of therapeutic entities in accordance with<br>
the invention will be administered with suitable carriers, excipients, and other agents that<br>
are incorporated into formulations to provide improved transfer, delivery, tolerance, and the<br>
like. A multitude of appropriate formulations can be found in the formulary known to all<br>
pharmaceutical chemists: Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (15th ed, Mack Publishing<br>
Company, Easton, PA (1975)), particularly Chapter 87 by Blaug, Seymour, therein. These<br>
formulations include, for example, powders, pastes, ointments, jellies, waxes, oils, lipids,<br>
lipid (cationic or anionic) containing vesicles (such as Lipofectin™), DNA conjugates,<br>
anhydrous absorption pastes, oil-in-water and water-in-oil emulsions, emulsions carbowax<br>
(polyethylene glycols of various molecular weights), semi-solid gels, and semi-solid<br>
mixtures containing carbowax. Any of the foregoing mixtures may be appropriate in<br>
45<br><br>
WO 2006/109191	PCT/IB2006/001514<br>
treatments and therapies in accordance with the present invention, provided that the active<br>
ingredient in the formulation is not inactivated by the formulation and the formulation is<br>
physiologically compatible and tolerable with the route of administration. See also Baldrick<br>

Therapeutic formulations of the invention, which include a huIFNy antibody of the<br>
invention, are used to treat or alleviate a symptom associated with an immune-related<br>
disorder, such as, for example, an autoimmune disease or an inflammatory disorder.<br>
For example, administering a huIFNy antibody to a subject suffering from Crohn's<br>
Disease (CD) can act directly on the disease-causing immune cells, thereby providing rapid<br>
intervention with minimal suppression of the immune system. Administering a huIFNy<br>
antibody to a subject suffering from Systemic Lupus Erythematosus is another medical<br>
indication that provides an opportunity to modify the immune cells responsible for the<br>
disease. Administering an huIFNy antibody, a fully human protein, to a subject suffering<br>
from psoriasis avoids the need to treat patients wife more aggressive medications (e.g.,<br>
Methotrexate) that have well documented unwanted side effects (e.g., liver damage).<br>
Administering a huIFNy antibody to a subject suffering from rheumatoid arthritis is another<br>
medical indication that provides the opportunity to modulate the upstream generation and<br>
function of disease-inducing Thl-mediated response.<br>
Autoimmune diseases include, for example, Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome<br>
(AIDS, which is a viral disease with an autoimmune component), alopecia areata,<br>
ankylosing spondylitis, antiphospholipid syndrome, autoimmune Addison's disease,<br>
autoimmune hemolytic anemia, autoimmune hepatitis, autoimmune inner ear disease<br>
(AIED), autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS), autoimmune<br>
thrombocytopenic purpura (ATP), Behcet's disease, cardiomyopathy, celiac sprue-<br>
dermatitis hepetiformis; chronic fatigue immune dysfunction syndrome (CFIDS), chronic<br>
inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIPD), cicatricial pemphigold, cold<br>

polymyalgia rheumatica, polymyositis and dermatomyositis, primary agammaglobulinemia,<br>
primaiy biliary cirrhosis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, Raynaud's phenomena, Reiter's<br>
syndrome, rheumatic fever, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, scleroderma (progressive<br>
systemic sclerosis (PSS), also known as systemic sclerosis (SS)), SjOgren's syndrome, stiff-<br>
man syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, Takayasu arteritis, temporal arteritis/giant<br>
cell arteritis, ulcerative colitis, uveitis, vitiligo and Wegener's granulomatosis.<br>
Inflammatory disorders include, for example, chronic and acute inflammatory<br>
disorders. Examples of inflammatory disorders include Alzheimer's disease, asthma, atopic<br>
allergy, allergy, atherosclerosis, bronchial asthma, eczema, glomerulonephritis, graft vs.<br>
host disease, hemolytic anemias, osteoarthritis, sepsis, stroke, transplantation of tissue and<br>
organs, vasculitis, diabetic retinopathy and ventilator induced lung injury.<br>
The huIFNy antibodies modulate an immune response in a subject, e.g., in a human<br>
subject. For example, the huIFNy antibodies described herein modulate, e.g., reduce, inhibit<br>
or prevent an exaggerated Thl-mediated immune response, such as an exaggerated Thl-<br>
mediated immune response associated with an autoimmune or inflammatory disorder such<br>
as, for example, Crohn's disease, system lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, sarcoidosis,<br>
rheumatoid arthritis, vasculitis, atopic dermatitis and secondary progressive multiple<br>
sclerosis. In an exaggerated Thl-mediated immune response, Thl cytokine(s), such as IL-2,<br>
IL-3, TNF-alpha (TNFa) and IFNy, are presented in a subject at level that is higher than the<br>
level of Thl cytokine production in a subject not suffering from a disease or disorder<br>
associated with an exaggerated Th-1 immune response. To classify a Thl-mediated<br>
immune response as an exaggerated response, the level of a Thl cytolcine production<br>
response is evaluated, e.g., by measuring and analyzing the level of secreted cytokines using<br>
an ELISA or other assay.<br>
47<br><br>
WO 2006/109191	PCT/IB2006/001514<br>
The huIFNy antibodies described herein are also used to modulate, e.g., inhibit,<br>
reduce or prevent, class switching to an IgG isotype, such as IFNy-induced class switching.<br>
These huIFNy antibodies modulate, e.g., inhibit, prevent or reduce a Till-mediated response<br>
and consequently decrease IFNY-induced switching.<br>
In one embodiment, the huIFNy antibody compositions used to treat an immune-<br>
related disorder are administered in combination with any of a variety of anti-cytokine<br>
agents or anti-chemokine agents. Suitable anti-cytokine or anti-chemokme reagents<br>
recognize, for example, cytokines such as interleukin 1 (IL-1), IL-2, EL-4, IL-6, EL-12, IL-<br>
13, IL-15, IL-17, IL-18, IL-20, IL-21, IL-22, IL-23, IL-27 and IL-31, and/or chemokines<br>
such as MIP1 alpha, MEP1 beta, RANTES, MCP1, IP-10, ITAC, MIG, SDF and fractalkine.<br>
The present invention also provides methods of treating or alleviating a symptom<br>
associated with an immune-related disorder. For example, the compositions of the<br>
invention are used to treat or alleviate a symptom of any of the autoimmune diseases and<br>
inflammatory disorders described herein. Symptoms associated with immune-related<br>
disorders include, for example, inflammation, fever, loss of appetite, weight loss, abdominal<br>
symptoms such as, for example, abdominal pain, diarrhea or constipation, joint pain or<br>
aches (arthralgia), fatigue, rash, anemia, extreme sensitivity to cold (Raynaud's<br>
phenomenon), muscle weakness, muscle fatigue, changes in skin or tissue tone, shortness of<br>
breath or other abnormal breathing patterns, chest pain or constriction of the chest muscles,<br>
abnormal heart rate (e.g., elevated or lowered), light sensitivity, blurry or otherwise<br>
abnormal vision, and reduced organ function.<br>
The therapeutic formulations of huIFNy antibody are administered to a subject<br>
suffering from an immune-related disorder, such as an autoimmune disease or an<br>
inflammatory disorder. A subject suffering from an autoimmune disease or an<br>
inflarnmatory disorder is identified by methods known in the art. For example, subjects<br>
suffering from an autoimmune disease such as Crohn's disease, lupus or psoriasis, are<br>
dentified using any of a variety of clinical and/or laboratory tests such as, physical<br>
;xamination, radiologic examination and blood, urine and stool analysis to evaluate immune<br>
status. For example, patients suffering from lupus are identified, e.g., by using the anti-<br>
nuclear antibody test (ANA) to determine if auto-antibodies to cell nuclei are present in the<br>
blood. Patients suffering from Crohn's are identified, e.g., using an upper gastrointestinal<br>
GI) series and/or a colonoscopy to evaluate the small and large intestines, respectively.<br>
48<br><br>
WO 2006/109191	PCT/IB2006/001514<br>
Patients suffering from psoriasis are identified, e.g., using microscopic examination of<br>
tissue taken from the affected skin patch, while patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis<br>
are identified using, e.g., blood tests and/or x-ray or other imaging evaluation.<br>
Administration of a huIFNy antibody to a patient suffering from an immune-related<br>
disorder such as an autoimmune disease or an inflammatory disorder if any of a variety of<br>
laboratory or clinical results is achieved. For example, administration of a huIFNy antibody<br>
to a patient suffering from an immune-related disorder such as an autoimmune disease or an<br>
inflammatory disorder is considered successful one or more of the symptoms associated<br>
with the disorder is alleviated, reduced, inhibited or does not progress to a further, i.e.,<br>
worse, state. Administration of a huIFNy antibody to a patient suffering from an immune-<br>
related disorder such as an autoimmune disease or an inflammatory disorder is considered<br>
successful if the disorder, e.g., an autoimmune disorder, enters remission or does not<br>
progress to a further, i.e., worse, state.<br>
Diagnostic and Prophylactic Formulations<br>
The fully human anti-IFNy MAbs of the invention are used in diagnostic and<br>
prophylactic formulations. In one embodiment, a huIFNy MAb of the invention is<br>
administered to patients that are at risk of developing one of the aforementioned<br>
autoimmune diseases. A patient's predisposition to one or more of the aforementioned<br>
autoimmune diseases can be determined using genotypic, serological or biochemical<br>
markers.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, a huIFNy antibody is administered to<br>
human individuals diagnosed with one or more of the aforementioned autoimmune diseases.<br>
Upon diagnosis, a huIFNy antibody is administered to mitigate or reverse the effects of<br>
autoimmuniry.<br>
Antibodies of the invention are also useful in the detection of IFNy in patient<br>
samples and accordingly are useful as diagnostics. For example, the huIFNy antibodies of<br>
the invention are used in in vitro assays, e.g., ELISA, to detect IFNy levels in a patient<br>
sample.<br>
In one embodiment, a huIFNy antibody of the invention is immobilized on a solid<br>
support {e.g., the well(s) of a microtiter plate). The immobilized antibody serves as a<br>
capture antibody for any IFNy that may be present in a test sample. Prior to contacting the<br>
49<br><br>
WO 2006/109191	PCT/IB2006/001514<br>
immobilized antibody with a patient sample, the solid support is rinsed and treated with a<br>
blocking agent such as mink protein or albumin to prevent nonspecific adsorption of the<br>
analyte.<br>
Subsequently the wells are treated with a test sample suspected of containing the<br>
antigen, or with a solution containing a standard amount of the antigen. Such a sample is,<br>
e.g., a serum sample from a subject suspected of having levels of circulating antigen<br>
considered to be diagnostic of a pathology. After rinsing away the test sample or standard,<br>
the solid support is treated with a second antibody that is detectably labeled. The labeled<br>
second antibody serves as a detecting antibody. The level of detectable label is measured,<br>
and the concentration of IFNy antigen in the test sample is determined by comparison with a<br>
standard curve developed from the standard samples.<br>
It will be appreciated that based on the results obtained using the huIFNy antibodies<br>
of the invention in an in vitro diagnostic assay, it is possible to stage a disease {e.g., an<br>
autoimmune or inflammatory disorder) in a subject based on expression levels of the IFNy<br>
antigen. For a given disease, samples of blood are taken from subjects diagnosed as being<br>
at various stages in the progression of the disease, and/or at various points in the therapeutic<br>
treatment of the disease. Using a population of samples that provides statistically<br>
significant results for each stage of progression or therapy, a range of concentrations of the<br>
antigen that may be considered characteristic of each stage is designated.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
The following examples, including the experiments conducted and results achieved<br>
are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not to be construed as limiting upon the<br>
present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1: Cloning, Expression and Purification of Human Interferon Gamma<br>
Cloning.<br>
The sequence corresponding to the mature sequence of human interferon gamma<br>
(hlFNy, huIFNy) was amplified from human cDNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)<br>
using specific oligonucleotides. The amplification production was gel-purified and cloned<br>
into the pET41c expression vector (Novagen, San Diego CA). The vector was further<br>
modified to introduce an Avitag™ (Avidity, Denver CO) and an octa-histidine tag at the C-<br>
terminus of hEFNy allowing for in vivo biotinylation of the protein and purification by<br>
IMAC (Immobilized Metal Ion Affinity Chromatography).<br>
Expression.<br>
E. coli BL21 cells were co-transformed with the pET41c-MFNy and a pACYCl 84-<br>
BirA vector, which encodes the BirA enzyme required for the in vivo biotinylation of the<br>
Avitag™ sequence. Single colonies resistant to Kanamycin (50 ng/ml) and<br>
Chloramphenicol (10 fig/ml) were selected and used to inoculate a starter culture in LB<br>
(Kan 50 mg/ml/Cm 10 jig/ml) and grown overnight at 37 °C.<br>
The next day, the culture was used to inoculate (1:100 dilution) a 400 ml culture of<br>
LB (Kan 50 mg/ml/Cm 10 mg/ml) supplemented with 50 mM biotin. The culture was grown<br>
at 37 °C with shaking (240 rpra) until an ODMO of 0.6 was reached. At that point,<br>
isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to a final concentration of<br>
1 mM, and the culture was further incubated for 3h under the same conditions. Cells were<br>
centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 minutes, and the pellet was frozen at -20°C. Under these<br>
conditions essentially all of the hlFNy was insoluble and found in inclusion bodies.<br>
Purification.<br>
Bacterial pellets were thawed and resuspended in 8 ml of Bugbuster reagent<br>
containing 8 p.1 of Benzonaze (Novagen) and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes.<br>
51<br><br>
WO 2006/109191	PCT/IB2006/001514<br>
The solution was centrifuged for 30 minutes at 15'000g at 4 °C. The pellet containing the<br>
inclusion bodies was resuspended in 7 ml of solubilization buffer (50 mM Tris-HCL pH 7.4,<br>
300 mM NaCl, 20 mM Imidazole, 5 mM p-mercaptoethanol, 6M Guanidin-HCl). The<br>
resuspended material was centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 minutes at 15'000g.<br>
Two 5 ml Hi Trap Chelating column (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, England),<br>
loaded with NiSO4 and equilibrated witli solubilization buffer, were connected together<br>
according to manufacturer's instructions. The supernatant after the centrifugation step was<br>
filter on a 0.45 pm membrane and loaded on the column with the help of peristaltic pump at<br>
1 ml/min. The columns weTe then placed on an AKTA prime chromatography system for on<br>
column protein refolding and elution. The immobilized protein was washed with 35 ml of<br>
solubilization buffer at 1 ml/min. A linear gradient of solubilization buffer with increasing<br>
concentration of refolding buffer (50 mM Tris-HCL pH 7.4,300 mM NaCl) was applied at<br>
1 ml/min. for 1 hour until 100% refolding buffer was reached. The column was then further<br>
washed with 25 ml of refolding buffer. The refolded protein was then eluted from the<br>
column with elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 300 mM NaCl, 400 mM Imidazole). Protein<br>
containing fractions were pooled and desalted onPDIO columns (Amersham) equilibrated<br>
with PBS. The desalted protein was then aliquoted and stored at -80 °C.<br>
EXAMPLE 2: Cells Expressing Interferon Gamma on Cell Surface<br>
Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (available from ATCC) were stably transfected<br>
with c-myc-tagged human IFNy cDNA. cDNAs were subcloned into pCDNA 3.1 plasmids<br>
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA) containing neomycin resistance genes. Transfectants were<br>
selected by using this antibiotic, and successive cell sorting was accomplished by flow<br>
cytometry using an anti-6xHis (Sigma) antibody. Surface expression of human IFNy was<br>
confirmed via flow cytometry using an anti-IFNy mAb (clone B27, Becton Dickinson,<br>
Franklin Lakes NJ).<br>
EXAMPLE 3: Screening of human scFv libraries<br>
General procedures for construction and handling of human scFv libraries are<br>
described in Vaughan et al., (Nat. Biotech. 1996,14:309-314), hereby incorporated by<br>
reference in its entirety. Libraries of human scFv were screened against hlFNy according to<br>
the following procedure.<br>

Liquid phase selections.<br>
Aliquots of scFvphage libraries (1012 Pfu) obtained from Cambridge Antibody<br>
Technology (Cambridge, UK) were blocked with PBS containing 3% (w/v) skimmed milk<br>
for one hour at room temperature on a rotary mixer. Blocked phage was then deselected on<br>
streptavidin magnetic beads (Dynal M-280) for one hour at room temperature on a rotary<br>
mixer. Deselected phage was then incubated with in vivo biorinylated hEFNy (100 nM) for<br>
two hours at room temperature on a rotary mixer. Beads were captured using a magnetic<br>
stand followed by four washes with PBS/0.1% Tween 20 and 3 washes with PBS. Beads<br>
were then directly added to 10 ml of exponentially growing TGI cells and incubated for one<br>
hour at 37 °C with slow shaking (100 rpm). An aliquot of the infected TGI was serial<br>
diluted to titer the selection output. The remaining infected TGI were spun at 3000 rpm for<br>
15 minutes and re-suspended in 0.5 ml 2xTY-AG (2xTY media containing 100 mg/ml<br>
ampicilin and 2% glucose) and spread on 2xTYAG agar Bioassay plates. After overnight<br>
incubation at 30 °C 10 ml of 2xTYAG was added to the plates and the cells were scraped<br>
. form the surface and transferred to a 50 ml polypropylene tube. 2xTYAG containing 50%<br>
glycerol was added to the cell suspension to obtain a final concentration of 17% glycerol.<br>
Aliquots of the selection round were kept at-80 °C.<br>
Cell surface selections.<br>
Aliquots of scFv phage libraries (1012 Pfu) obtained from Cambridge Antibody<br>
Technology (Cambridge, UK) were blocked with PBS containing 3% (w/v) skimmed milk<br>
for one hour at room temperature on a rotary mixer. Blocked phage was then deselected for<br>
one hour at 37 °C/5% CO2 on CHO cells transfected with an empty pDisplay vector (in a<br>
T75 flask 80% confluence) and that had been previously blocked with PBS containing 2%<br>
(w/v) skimmed milk. Deselected phage was then incubated CHO-pDisplay-hlFNy cells for<br>
one hour at room temperature with gentle shaking. Cells were then washed ten times with<br>
PBS. Bound phage was eluted by adding directly 10 ml of exponentially growing TGI to<br>
the T75 flask and incubating for one hour at 37 °C with slow shaking. An aliquot of the<br>
infected TGI was serial diluted to titer the selection output. Infected TGI were spun at 3000<br>
rpm for 15 minutes and re-suspended in 0.5 ml 2xTY-AG (2xTY media containing 100<br>
mg/ml ampicilin and 2% glucose) and spread on 2xTYAG agar Bioassay plates. After<br>
overnight incubation at 30°C 10 ml of 2xTYAG was added to the plates and the cells were<br>
53<br><br>
WO 2006/109191	PCT/IB2006/001514<br>
scraped form the surface and transferred to a 50 ml polypropylene tube. 2xTYAG<br>
containing 50% glycetol was added to the cell suspension to obtain a final concentration of<br>
17% glycerol. Aliquots of the selection round were kept at ~80°C.<br>
Phage rescue.<br>
100 f.il of cell suspension obtained from previous selection rounds were added to 20<br>
ml of 2xTYAG and grown at 37 °C with agitation (240 rpm) until an OD60o of 0.3 to 0.5<br>
was reached. The culture was then super-infected with 3.3 x 1010 MK13K07 helper phage<br>
and incubated for one hour at 37 °C (150 rpm). The medium was then changed by<br>
centrifugating the cells at 2000 rpm for 10 minutes, removing the medium and resuspending<br>
the pellet in 20 ml of 2xTY-AK (lOOjig/ml ampicilin; 50 mg/ml kanamycin). The culture<br>
was then grown overnight at 30 °C (240 rpm).<br>
Monoclonal phage rescue for ELISA.<br>
Single clones were picked into a microtiter plate containing 150ul of 2xTYAG<br>
media (2% glucose) per well and grown at 37°C (100-120 rpm) for 5-6h. M13KO7 helper<br>
phage was added to each well to obtain a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 (i.e., 10<br>
phage for each cell in the culture) and incubated at 37°C (100 rpm) for Ih. Following<br>
growth, plates weTe.centrifuged at 3,200 rpm for 10 min. Supernatant was carefully<br>
removed, cells re-suspended in 150 u.12xTYAK. medium and grown overnight at 30 °C (120<br>
rpm). For the ELISA, the phage are blocked by adding 150ml of 2x concentration PBS<br>
containing 5% skimmed milk powder followed by one hour incubation at room temperature.<br>
The plates were then centrifuged 10 minutes at 3000 rpm and the phage containing<br>
supernatant used for the ELISA.<br>
Phage ELISA.<br>
ELISA plates (Maxisorb, NUNC) were coated overnight with 2 jig/ml HFNy in<br>
PBS. Control plates were coated with 2mg/ml BSA. Plates were then blocked with 3%<br>
ikimmed milk / PBS at room temperature for lh. Plates were washed 3 times with PBS<br>
(.05% Tween 20 before transferring the pre-blocked phage supernatants and incubation for<br>
me hour at room temperature. Plates were then washed 3 times with PBS 0.05% Tween 20.<br>
50ml of 3% skimmed milk/ PBS containing (HRP)-conjugated anti-Ml3 antibody<br>
Amersham, diluted 1:10,000) to each well. Following incubation at room temperature for<br>
1. hr, the plates were washed 5 times with PBS 0.05% Tween 20. The ELISA was then<br>

WO 2006/109191	PCT/IB2006/001514<br>
revealed by adding 50ml of 1MB (Sigma) and 50ml of 2N H2SO4 to stop the reaction.<br>
Absorption intensity was read at 450nm.<br>
Phage clone sequencing<br>
Single clones were placed in a microtiter plate containing 150ul of 2xTYAG media<br>
(2% glucose) per well and grown at 30 °C (120 rpm) overnight. The next day 5 ml of culture<br>
was transferred into another plate containing 45 mlof dH2O and mixed. The plates was then<br>
frozen at-20 °C. After thawing, 1m l of this suspension was used for PCR amplification<br>
using standard PCR protocols with primer specific for pCANTAB6: mycseq, 5'-<br>
CTCTTCTGAGATGAGTTTTTG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 100) and gene3leader, 5'-<br>
TTATTATTCGCAATTCCTTTAGTTGTTCCT-3' (SEQ IDNO:101).<br>
The PCR reactions were purified in 96 well format using the Montage PCRf.i96<br>
system (Millipore). 5 ml of the eluted DNA was sequencing using the mycseq and<br>
gene31eader primers.<br>
ScFv periplasmic preparation for functional tests.<br>
Individual clones were inoculated into a deep well microtiter plate containing 0.9 ml<br>
of 2xTYAG media (0.1% glucose) per well and grown at 37 °C for 5-6h (250 rpm). l00ml<br>
per well of 0.2 mM IPTG in 2xTY medium were then added to give a final concentration of<br>
0.02 mM IPTG. Plates were then incubated overnight at 30 °C with shaking at 250 rpm.<br>
The deep-well plates were centrifuged at 2,500 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant carefully<br>
removed. The pellets were re-suspended in 150ml TES buffer (50 mM Tris / HC1 (pH 8), 1<br>
mM EDTA (pH 8), 20% sucrose, complemented with Complete protease inhibitor, Roche).<br>
A hypotonic shock was produced by adding 150 ml of diluted TES buffer (1:5 TES:water<br>
dilution) and incubation on ice for 30 min. Plates were then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10<br>
minutes to remove cells and debris. The supernatants were carefully transferred into<br>
another microtiter plate and kept on ice for immediate testing in functional assays or<br>
ELISAs.<br>
Large scale scFv purification<br>
A starter culture of 1 ml of 2xTYAG was inoculated with a single colony from a<br>
freshly streaked 2xTYAG agar plate and incubated with shaking (240 rpm) at 37 °C for 5<br>
hours. 0.9 ml of this culture was used to inoculate a 400 ml culture of the same media and<br>
was grown overnight at 30 °C with vigorous shaking (300 rpm).<br>
55<br><br>
WO 2006/109191	PCT/IB2006/001514<br>
The next day the culture was induced by adding 400 m1 of 1M IPTG and incubation<br>
was continued for an additional 3 hours. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 5,000<br>
rpm for 10 minutes at 4 °C. Pelleted cells were resuspended in 10 ml of ice-cold TES buffer<br>
complemented with protease inhibitors as described above. Osmotic shock was achieved by<br>
adding 15 ml of 1:5 diluted TES buffer and incubation for 1 hour on ice. Cells were<br>
centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 20 minutes at 4 °C to pellet cell debris. The supernatant was<br>
carefully transferred to a fresh tube. Imidazole was added to the supernatant to a final<br>
concentration of 10 mM. 1 ml of Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen), equilibrated in PBS was added to<br>
each tube and incubated on a rotary mixer at 4 °C (20 rpm) for 1 hour.<br>
The tubes were centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 5 minutes and the supernatant carefully<br>
removed. The pelleted resin was resuspended in 10 ml of cold (4 °C) Wash buffer 1 (50<br>
mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, pH to 8.0). The suspension was added to<br>
a polyprep column (Biorad). 8 ml of cold Wash Buffer 2 (50 mM NaH2PO4,300 mM NaCl,<br>
20 mM imidazole, pH to 8.0) were used to wash the column by gravity flow. The scFv were<br>
eluted from the column with 2 ml of Elution buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 250<br>
mM imidazole, pH to 8.0). Fractions were analyzed by absorption at 280 nm and protein<br>
containing fractions were pooled before buffer exchange on a PD10 desalting column<br>
(Amersham) equilibrated with PBS. The scFv in PBS were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and<br>
quantified by absorption at 280 nm. The purified scFv were aliquoted and stored at -20°C<br>
and at 4°C.<br>
EXAMPLE 4: scFv Extract Inhibition of Interferon Gamma-Induced Reporter Gene<br>
Expression<br>
Periplasmic scFv extracts of various huIFNy antibodies were produced as described<br>
above. A high through-put screen cell-based assay was used for the identification of single<br>
chain variable fragment (scFv) blockers of IFNy activity. A reporter gene (firefly<br>
luciferase), driven by the IFNy-inducible GBP1 promoter, was transfected into the human<br>
melanoma cell line, Me67.8. Both scFv and IFNy were added to the cell culture<br>
concomitantly. Following a 6 hour incubation time, the luciferase reporter assay was<br>
performed. The scFv found to inhibit the induction of firefly luciferase were retained for<br>
further validation.<br>

Several scFv extracts inhibited the IFNy-induced reporter gene in a dose dependant<br>
fashion (Figure 15). For each scFv clone shown in Figure 15, various concentrations (2.7,<br>
0.68, 0.17,0.043 and 0.011 nM) were tested as shown by the columns above each clone<br>
name (descending concentration from left to right). The percentage inhibition exhibited by<br>
each scFv extract at these various concentrations is shown in Table 3 below.<br>

EXAMPLE 5: scFv Inhibition of Interferon Gamma-Induced MHC Class II<br>
Expression<br>
0	A flow cytometric assay was implemented to identify fully human IgG antibodies, or<br>
fragments thereof, capable of blocking the expression of IFNy-induced MHC class II<br>
molecules. Following the plating of Me67.8 cells, 5 ng/ml recombinant human IFNy was<br>
added to cultures in the presence of various concentrations of candidate fully human anti-<br>
IFNy monoclonal antibodies. Following 48 h in culture, cells were stained with<br>
5     fluorescently labeled anti-human MHC class II antibody (HLA-DR) and analyzed using a<br>
FACSCalibur®. Thus, the IC50 (where 50% of the IFNy-induced MHC class II expression is<br>
inhibited, i.e,, 50% inhibitory concentration), for each candidate antibody is measured.<br>
Purified fully human scFv were produced as described above in Example 1. The<br>
effect of the scFv on IFNy-induced MHC class II expression on melanoma cells was<br>
[)     evaluated using the flow cytometric cell-based assay described above. These scFv inhibited<br>
IFNy-induced MHC II expression on melanoma cells. (Figure 16, Panels 1-12). The ability<br>
of these scFv clones to inhibit IFNy-induced MHC II expression on melanoma cells was<br>
compared to a mouse anti-human IFNy mAb referred to herein as 16C3. scFv clones (—)<br>
and the mouse anti-human IFNy mAb 16C3 (—) are depicted in Figure 16.<br>

EXAMPLE 6: Reformatting scFv into IgG Format<br>
Purified fully human scFv were produced as described above in Example 1. The VH<br>
and VL. sequence of selected scFv were amplified with specific oligonucleotides introducing<br>
a leader sequence and a HindlTl restriction site at the 5' end. An Apal or an Avrll site was<br>
introduced at the 3' end of the heavy and light chain sequence, respectively. The amplified<br>
VH sequences were digested HindlH/Apal and cloned into the pCon_gammal expression<br>
vector (LONZA, Basel, Switzerland). The amplified VL sequences were digested HindlD/<br>
Avrll and cloned into the pCon_lambda2 expression vector (LONZA). The constructions<br>
were verified by sequencing before transfection into mammalian cells.<br>
The VH and VL CDNA sequences in their appropriate expression vectors were<br>
transfected into mammalian cells using the Fugene 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche, Basel,<br>
Switzerland). Briefly, Peak cells were cultured in 6-well plates at a concentration of 6 x 105<br>
cells per well in 2 ml culture media containing fetal bovine serum. The expression vectors,<br>
encoding the candidate VH and VL sequences, were co-transfected into the cells using the<br>
Fugene 6 Transfection Reagent according to manufacturer's instructions. One day<br>
following transfection, the culture media was aspirated, and 3 ml of fresh serum-free media<br>
was added to cells and cultured for three days at 37 °C. Following three days culture period,<br>
the supernatant was harvested for IgG purified on protein G columns.<br>
Reformatted fully IgG was purified from serum-free supernatants from transfected<br>
cells using Protein G-Sepharose 4B fast flow columns (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) according to<br>
manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, supernatants from transfected cells were incubated<br>
overnight at 4 °C with ImmunoPure (G) IgG binding buffer (Pierce, Rockford IL). Samples<br>
were then passed over Protein G-Sepharose 4B fast flow columns and the IgG consequently<br>
purified using elution buffer. The eluted IgG fraction was then dialyzed against PBS and<br>
the IgG content quantified by absorption at 280 nm. Purity and IgG integrity were verified<br>
by SDS-PAGE.<br>

EXAMPLE 8: Back-Mutation of huIFNy Antibody Clone to Germline Sequence<br>
In the studies described herein, the nucleotides and amino acid residues in the<br>
nucleic acid and amino acid sequence of the A6 clone were mutated to correspond to the<br>
nucleotide or amino acid residue found in the germline sequence. This process is referred to<br>
herein as "back-mutation".<br>
A6 heavy chain: The immunoglobulin heavy variable gene of antibody A6 had a<br>
100% homology to the human germ line DP-47 or IGHV3-23 (GenBank Accession number<br>
M99660). The immunoglobulin heavy joining (IGHJ) region of A6 was compared to the<br>
six human functional IGHJ regions. The IGHJ region of A6 was identified as IGHJ2 (Table<br>
5A below), but had a better overall homology with IGHJ5-02 (Table 5B below). The<br>
59<br><br>
original IGHJ region of A6 was therefore mutated to correspond to the sequence of IGHJ5-<br>
02, but only for the sequence outside the CDR3.  Mutated nucleotides and amino acid<br>
residues are shown in boxes in Tables 5A and 5B, and the CDR regions are underlined.<br><br>
A6 light chain: The immunoglobulin lambda variable gene (VL) of antibody A6<br>
belongs to the IGLV6-57 or VI-22 subgroup (GenBank Accession Number Z73673). A6-<br>
VL has 7 mutations compared to IGLV6-57, three in the CDRs and four in the frameworks<br>
(Table 6 below). The mutated nucleotides and amino acid residues are shown in boxes in<br>
Table 6, and the CDR regions are underlined.<br>
The four mutations in framework regions are: Ser to Ala in framework 2 region at<br>
Kabat position 43; Ser to Thr in framework 3 region at Kabat position 72; Lys to Glu and<br>
Thr to Ala in framework 3 region at Kabat positions 79 and 80, respectively. The four<br>
mutations in the framework regions were changed first individually, then all together back<br>
to the corresponding human germ line residue. The mutations of these four residues back to<br>
the corresponding human germ line amino acid did not alter in any way the binding affinity<br>
of the NI-0501 antibody, also referred to herein as "backmutated A6", to its target antigen<br>
as compared to the A6 antibody. The mutations from the A6 VL sequence to the<br>
corresponding germ line residue in CDRl (Ala to Val) and CDR2 (Gin to Arg) were carried<br>
out and were shown not to modify the overall affinity for huIFNy of the NI-0501 antibody<br>
(backmutated A6) as compared to the A6 antibody.<br><br>
Table 6: Comparison between A6 and human functional IGHV6-57 gene<br><br>
The complete sequences of the NI-0501 heavy and light chains are set forth in<br>
Figures 1A-1D. The nucleotides and amino acid residues that were backrautated to produce<br>
the NI-0501 antibody (i.e., those nucleotides and residues that were changed from the<br>
original A6 sequence) are underlined and italicized in Figures 1A and 1C.<br>
EXAMPLE 9: Affinity and Binding Kinetics of huIFNy Antibody<br>
The affinity and binding kinetics of the NI-0501 huIFNy antibody were<br>
characterized on a Biacore 2000 instrument (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). 200 RU of<br>
NI-0501 were immobilized by EDC/NHS chemistry on a Cl Biacore chip. Binding was<br>
measured by passing hlFNy (R&amp;D Systems) in HBS-EP buffer at concentrations between<br>
200 nM and 1 nM. The flow rate was 100 PCT/IB2006/001514I/minute and the temperature set at 25 °C. The<br>
data was fitted according to 1:1 Langmuir model and the Kon, KofTand KD values<br>
determined (Figure 18).<br>
EXAMPLE 10: Activity of huIFNy Antibody<br>
The activity of the NI-0501 huIFNy antibody was compared to the activity of the<br>
antibody produced by the clone A6 (i.e., the A6 huIFNy antibody). In this study, the ability<br>
of each huIFNy antibody to inhibit recombinant human IFNy (rhuIFNy)-induced MHC class<br>
II up-regulation on the human melanoma cell line, Me67.8 was evaluated. Briefly, Me67.8<br>
melanoma cells were incubated with rhuIFNy, in the presence of NI-0501 or the A6 huIFNy<br>
antibody for 48-72 h. MHC class II upregulation was measured as described above in<br>
Example 5. The two antibodies presented a similar activity, which demonstrates that the<br>
**1<br><br>
WO 2006/109191	PCT/IB2006/001514<br>
backmutations in the NI-0501 huIFNy antibody did not modify the activity of the antibody<br>
(Figure 19).<br>
The activity of the NI-0501 huIFNy antibody was then tested on native IFNy. In this<br>
study, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were activated with 1 mg/ml of<br>
the mitogen PHA for 48 h, and supernatants were tested via ELISA for the presence of<br>
native IFNy. This supernatant was then used to stimulate the MHC class II upregulation on<br>
Me67.8 cells. NI-0501 was able to neutralize the MHC class II upregulation induced by<br>
native human IFNy (Figure 20).<br>
EXAMPLE 11: Cross-Reactivity of huIFNy Antibody<br>
Binding assay: NI-0501 was tested for its ability to bind to IFNy using a Sandwich<br>
ELISA format assay. Briefly, IFNy from the species mentioned in the title of each graph<br>
shown in Figure 21 was captured with pre-coated NI-0501 (- A-) or the control anti-species<br>
IFNy mAb (-■-). The IFNy from each species was detected using a polyclonal antibody<br>
specific for the IFNy in that assay. As seen in Figure 21, NI-0501 binding to rat IFNy is<br>
similar to the control antibody, but not for the other species, excluding cynomolgus<br>
monkey.<br>
Neutralization of IFNy activity: The antibody NI-0501 was tested for its ability to<br>
neutralize or inhibit recombinant IFNy proteins from several different species. Briefly,<br>
recombinant IFNy from the various tested species was placed in culture with Me67.8 cells<br>
in the presence or absence of NI-0501 for 48-72 h. MHC class II upregulation was<br>
measured as described above in Example 5. The cross-reactivity to, and neutralization of,<br>
cynomolgus IFNy was demonstrated by inhibiting the MHC class II upregulation on the<br>
human melanoma cell line, Me67.8 (Figure 21). NI-0501 was able to inhibit IFNy from<br>
cynomolgus monkey but could not neutralize IFNy from the other tested species,<br>
demonstrating no cross reactivity the antibody with these species (Table 7).<br>

In addition, cynomolgus PBMCs were activated with 1 jig/ml of the mitogen PHA<br>
for 48 h, and supernatants were tested via ELISA for the presence of native IFNy. This<br>
supernatant was then used to stimulate the MHC class II upregulation on Me67.8. NI-0501<br>
was able to neutralize the MHC class II upregulation induced by native cynomolgus TFNy<br>
(Figure 22).<br>
EXAMPLE 12: Biological Activity of huIFNy Antibody<br>
The studies described herein were designed to test the biological activity of the NI-<br>
0501 huIFNy antibody upon administration to cynomolgus monkeys. NI-0501 was chosen<br>
for the safety and pharmacokinerics (PK) studies described herein because this huIFNy<br>
antibody was found to cross-react with the IFNy from cynomolgus monkeys, as described<br>
above.  To evaluate adverse clinical effects after multiple intravenous infusions, monkeys<br>
are infused with the following doses: 30 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg.<br>
In mice with a disrupted IFNy gene, decreased levels of IgG2a and increased levels<br>
of IgGl were observed in response to KLH immunization, demonstrating the correlation<br>
between IFNy and the IgG response. During the 13 week main toxicology study, monkeys<br>
are immunized with KLH in Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant (IFA). A typical immune<br>
response to KLH/TFA in monkeys, co-treated with placebo, elicits a KLH-specific IgM and<br>
IgG response detectable in the serum. These studies are designed to evaluate whether<br>
neutralizing IFNy in NI-0501-treated monkeys that were immunized with KLH in IF A,<br>
alters the KLH-specific IgG titer.<br>

EXAMPLE 13: Modulation of EFNy Activity Using huIFNy Antibodies<br>
The production of the chemokine IP-10 is up-regiilated by IFNy in several different<br>
cell lines. Based on this observation a whole blood assay was developed. In flu's whole<br>
blood assay, whole blood samples from several donors were mixed with a fixed<br>
concentration of IFNy and different concentrations of NI-0501. After incubation, IP-10<br>
levels were measured by ELISA as a means for evaluating the efficacy of the anti-IFNy<br>
antibody to block the production of IP-10 (Figure 23).<br>
