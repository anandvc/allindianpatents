dextrorotatory isomer;<br>
as well as their salts with, inorganic or organic acids,<br>
their solvates and/or their hydrates, are preferred.<br>
The following compound: - N,N-dimethyl-l-[2-[4-benzoyl-2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-morpholin-2-yl]ethyl]-4-(piperidin-1-yl)piperidine-4-carboxamide, dextrorotatory isomer;<br>
as well as its salts with inorganic or organic acids, its solvates and/or its hydrates is particularly preferred.<br>
According to another of its aspects, the present invention relates to a method for preparing the compounds of formula (I), their salts, their solvates and/or their hydrates, characterized in that:<br>
a compound of formula:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
in which B and Z are as defined for a compound of formula (I), is reacted with a compound of formula:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
in which R1 is as defined for a compound of formula (I), in the presence of an acid, in a solvent, and then the intermediate iminium salt formed is reduced by means of a reducing agent.<br>
Optionally, the compound of formula (I) is converted to one of its salts with inorganic or organic acids.<br>
The reaction is carried out in the presence of an acid such as acetic acid, in a solvent such as methanol or dichloromethane, at a temperature between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvent, and forms in  situ  an intermediate imine which is chemically reduced using, for example, sodium cyanoborohydride or sodium triacetoxyborohydride. or catalytically using hydrogen and a catalyst such as palladium on carbon or Raney nickel.<br>
According to a variant of the method:<br>
a compound of formula:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
in which B and Z are as defined for a compound of formula (I) and Y represents a methyl, phenyl, tolyl or trifluoromethyl group, is reacted with a compound of formula:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
in which Ri is as defined for a compound of formula (I) .<br>
Optionally, the compound of formula (I) is converted to one of its salts with inorganic or organic acids.<br>
The reaction is carried out in an inert solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide, acetonitrile, methylene chloride, toluene or isopropanol and in the presence or the absence of a base. When a base is used, it is chosen from organic bases such as triethylamine, N,N-diisopropylethylamine or N-methylmorpholine or from the alkali metal carbonates or bicarbonates such as potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate or sodium<br>
bicarbonate. In the absence of a base, the reaction is carried out using an excess of the compound of formula (III) and in the presence of an alkali metal iodide such as potassium iodide or sodium iodide. The reaction is carried out at a temperature between room temperature and 100°C.<br>
According to another variant of the method,<br>
a compound of formula:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
in which R1 is as defined for a compound of formula (I) , is reacted with a functional derivative of an acid of formula:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
in which B and Z are as defined for a compound of formula (I).<br>
Optionally, the compound of formula (I) is converted to one of its salts with inorganic or organic acids.<br>
As a functional derivative of the acid (VI), the acid itself, or alternatively one of the functional derivatives which react with amines, for example an anhydride, a mixed anhydride, the acid chloride, or an<br>
activated ester, such as the para-nitrophenyl ester, is used.<br>
When the acid of formula (VI) itself is used, the procedure is carried out in the presence of a coupling agent used in peptide chemistry such as 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimine or benzotriazol-1-yloxy-tris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate in the presence of a base such as triethylamine or N,N-diisopropylethylamine, in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane or N,N-dimethylformamide at a temperature between 0°C and room temperature.<br>
When an acid chloride is used, the reaction is carried out in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane or benzene, in the presence of a base such as triethylamine or N-methylmorpholine and at a temperature between -60°C and room temperature.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) thus obtained may be subsequently separated from the reaction medium and purified according to conventional methods, for example by crystallization or chromatography.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) thus obtained are isolated in the form of a free base or a salt, according to conventional techniques.<br>
When the compounds of formula (I) are obtained in the form of a free base, the salification is carried out by treating with the chosen acid in an<br>
organic solvent. By treating the free base, dissolved for example in an ether such as diethyl ether or in an alcohol such as 2-propanol or in acetone or in dichloromethane, or in ethyl acetate or in acetonitrile with a solution of the chosen acid in one of the abovementioned solvents, the corresponding salt is obtained which is isolated according to conventional techniques.<br>
Thus, the hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulphate, trifluoroacetate, hydrogen sulphate, dihydrogen sulphate, methanesulphonate, oxalate, maleate, succinate, fumarate, naphthalene-2-sulphonate, benzenesulphonate, para-toluenesulphonate, gluconate, citrate or acetate is, for example, prepared.<br>
At the end of the reaction, the compounds of formula (I) may be isolated in the form of one of their salts, for example, the hydrochloride or oxalate; in this case, if it is necessary, the free base may be prepared by neutralizing the said salt with an inorganic or organic base, such as sodium hydroxide or triethylamine or with an alkali metal carbonate or bicarbonate, such as sodium or potassium carbonate or bicarbonate.<br>
The compounds of formula (II) are prepared according to known methods such as those described in -WO 96/23787.<br>
For example, a compound of formula (II) is prepared according to SCHEME 1 below in which E represents a hydrogen atom or an O-protecting group.<br>
SCHEME 1<br>
(Scheme Removed)  <br>
When E represents a protecting group, the latter is chosen from conventional O-protecting groups well known to a person skilled in the art, such as for example tetrahydropyran-2-yl, benzoyl or a (C1-C4) alkylcarbonyl.<br>
In Step aJL of SCHEME 1, a compound of formula (VII) is reacted with a functional derivative of an acid of formula (VI), according to the methods previously described, in order to obtain a compound of<br>
formula (VIII).<br>
The compound of formula (VIII) thus obtained is optionally deprotected in Step b1 according to methods known to a person skilled in the art. For example, when E represents a tetrahydropyran-2-yl group, the deprotection is carried out by acid hydrolysis using hydrochloric acid in a solvent such as ether, methanol or a mixture of these solvents, or using pyridinium p-toluenesulphonate in a solvent such as methanol or alternatively, using a resin Amberlyst in a solvent such as methanol. The reaction is carried out at a temperature between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvent. When E represents a benzoyl group or a (C1-C4)alkylcarbonyl group, the deprotection is carried out by hydrolysis in alkaline medium using for example an alkali metal hydroxide such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide or lithium hydroxide, in an inert solvent such as water, methanol, ethanol, dioxane or a mixture of these solvents, at a temperature of between 0°C and the reflux temperature of the solvent.<br>
In Step C1, the alcohol of formula (IX) is oxidized in order to obtain the aldehyde of formula (II). The oxidation reaction is carried out using, for example, oxalyl chloride, dimethyl sulphoxide and triethylamine in a solvent such as dichloromethane and<br>
at a temperature of between -78°C and room temperature. The compounds of formula (III) are known and are prepared according to known methods. For example, a compound of formula (III) is prepared according to SCHEME 2 below.<br>
SCHEME 2<br>
(Scheme Removed)  <br>
Steps a2 and b2 of SCHEME 2 are carried out according to the procedures described in Steps A and I of Preparation 2.16 in WO 96/23787.<br>
In Step c2, compound 3 is reacted with a methyl halide, preferably methyl iodide, in the presence of a strong base such as sodium hydride, in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran and at a temperature between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvent and a mixture of the compound of formula (X) in which R1 = H and the compound of formula (X) in which R1 = CH3 is obtained which is separated according to conventional methods such as chromatography.<br>
The compounds (X) are deprotected in Steps d2 or e2 according to known methods in order to give the expected compounds of formula (III).<br>
The compounds of formula (IV) are prepared according to known methods such as those described in WO 9 6/237 87. For example, a compound of formula (IX) is reacted with a compound of formula:<br>
Y-SO2-C1       (XI) in which Y represents a methyl, phenyl, tolyl or trifluoromethyl group. The reaction is carried out in the presence of abase such as triethylamine, pyridine, N,N-diisopropylamine or N-methylmorpholine, in a solvent such as dichloromethane or toluene, and at a temperature of between -20°C and the reflux temperature of the solvent.<br>
The compounds of formula (V) are prepared according to SCHEME 3 below in .which E represents<br><br>
hydrogen or an O-protecting group and Pr represents an<br>
N-protecting group.<br>
SCHEME 3<br>
(Scheme Removed)  <br>
When Pr represents an N-protecting group, the latter is chosen from conventional N-protecting groups well known to a person skilled in the art such as, for example, the tert-butoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl or trityl group.<br>
The compounds of formula (VI) are marketed or<br>
prepared according to known methods. Thus, for example, 2-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)acetic acid is prepared according to SCHEME 4 below following the procedures described in Preparation 1.1.<br>
(Scheme Removed)  <br>
The compounds of formula (VII) are known and prepared according to known methods such as those described in WO 96/23787, in WO 01/04105, in WO 00/58292 or in Tetrahedron: Asymmetry, 1988, 9_, 3251-3262.<br>
During any one of the steps for preparing the compounds of formula (I) or the intermediate compounds of formula (II), (III), (IV), (V) or (VI), it may be necessary and/or desirable to protect the reactive or sensitive functional groups, such as the amine, hydroxyl or carboxyl groups, present on any one of the molecules involved. This protection may -be carried out<br>
using conventional protecting groups such as those described in Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, J.F.W. McOmie, ed. Plenum Press, 1973, in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wutts, Ed. John Wiley and Sons, 1991 or in Protecting Groups, Kocienski P.J., 1994, Georg Thieme Verlag. The elimination of the protecting groups may be carried out in an appropriate subsequent step using methods known to a person skilled in the art and which do not affect the rest of the molecule involved.<br>
The resolution of the racemic mixtures of the compounds of formula (I) makes it possible to isolate the enantiomers.<br>
It is however preferable to carry out the resolution of the racemic mixtures from the compound of formula (VII, E = H) or alternatively from an intermediate compound useful for preparing a compound of formula (VII), according to the methods described in the publications cited above for the preparation of a compound of formula (VII).<br>
The compounds of formula (I) above also comprise those in which one or more hydrogen or carbon atoms have been replaced by their radioactive isotope, for example tritium, or carbon-14. Such labelled compounds are useful in research, metabolic or pharmacokinetic work, or in biochemical trials as<br>
receptor ligands.<br>
The compounds according to the invention have been the subject of biochemical tests.<br>
The affinity of the compounds for tachykinin receptors was evaluated in  vitro  by several biochemical tests using radioligands:<br>
1)	The binding of [125I]BH-SP (Substance P labelled with iodine-125 using the Bolton-Hunter reagent) to the NKi receptors of human lymphoblastic cells (D.G. Payan et al., J. Immunol., 1984, 133, 3260-3265).<br>
2)	The binding of [125I] |His-NKA to the cloned human NK2 receptors expressed by CHO cells (Y. Takeda et al., J. Neurochem. , 1992, 5_9_, 740-745).<br>
3)	The binding of [125I] His [MePhe7]NKB to the cloned human NK3 receptors expressed by CHO cells (Buell et al., FEBS Letters, 1992, 299, 90-95).<br>
The tests were carried out according to X. Emonds-Alt et al. (Eur. J. Pharmacol., 1993, 250, 403-413; Life Sci. , 1995, 5J5, PL 27-32).<br>
The compounds according to the invention weakly inhibit the binding of substance P to the NKi receptors of the human lymphoblastic cells IM9. The inhibition constant Ki for the receptors of the human lymphoblastic cells is greater than or equal to 8 x 10~9M.<br>
The compounds according to the invention strongly inhibit the binding of [125I] His-NKA to the cloned human NK2 receptors. The inhibition constant Ki is less than or equal to 5 x 1CT10M. Thus, the compound of Example 1 possesses a Ki equal to 4 x 10_11M.<br>
The compounds according to the invention strongly inhibit the binding of [125I] His [MePhe7]NKB to the cloned human NK3 receptors: the inhibition constant Ki is less than or equal to 7 x 10~10M. Thus, the compound of Example 1 possesses a Ki equal to 4 x 10_11M.<br>
The prior art compound a inhibits the binding of [125I] His-NKA to the cloned NK2 receptors with a Ki equal to 4 x 10_11M. It inhibits the binding of [125I]His [MePhe7]NKB to the cloned human NK3 receptors with a Ki equal to 2 x 1CT9M.<br>
The compounds of the present invention were also evaluated in  vivo  on animal models.<br>
In gerbils, a rotating behaviour is induced by intrastriatal administration of a specific agonist of the NK2 receptor, [Nle10]NKA (4-10) ; it was observed that a unilateral application of [Nle10]NKA(4-10) into the gerbil striatum leads to strong contralateral rotations which are inhibited by the compounds according to the invention administered either by the intraperitoneal route, or by the. oral route. This test<br>
was carried out according to M. Poncelet et al., Neurosci, Lett., 1993, 149, 40-42. In this test, the compounds according to the invention are active at doses ranging from 0.1 mg to 3 0 mg per kg. For example, the compound of Example 1 possesses an effective dose 50 (ED50) of 2.9 mg per kg by the intraperitoneal route and an ED50 of 6.5 mg per kg by the oral route.<br>
In gerbils, a rotating behaviour is induced by intrastriatal administration of a specific agonist of the NK3 receptor: senktide; it is observed that a unilateral application of senktide into the gerbil striatum leads to strong contralateral rotations which are inhibited by the compounds according to the invention administered either by the intraperitoneal route, or by the oral route. This test was carried out according to X. Emonds-Alt et al., Life Sci., 1995, 56, PL27-PL32. In this test, the compounds according to the invention are active at doses ranging from 0.1 mg to 30 mg per kg. For example, the compound of Example 1 possesses an ED50 of 2.8 mg per kg by the intraperitoneal route and an ED50 of 4.3 mg per kg by the oral route.<br>
In rats, the application of an agonist of the NK2 receptors in the septum causes an increase in the release of acetylcholine in the hippocampus (test carried out according to R. Steinberg et al., Eur.<br>
J. Neurosci., 1998, K), 2337-2345). Likewise in guinea pigs, the local application of an agonist of the NK3 receptors in the septum causes an increase in the release of acetylcholine in the hippocampus (test carried out according to N. Marco et al., Neuropeptides, 1998, 3_2, 481-488). The compounds according to the invention block this increase in the release of acetylcholine whether it is caused by an agonist of the NK2 receptors or by an agonist of the NK3 receptors. For example, the compound of Example 1 blocks this increase in the release of acetylcholine caused either by an agonist of the NK2 receptors in rats, or by an agonist of the NK3 receptors in guinea pigs, at doses of 0.1-0.3 mg/kg and 0.3-1 mg/kg by the intraperitoneal route, respectively.<br>
In rats, constraint stress causes an increase in the tissue level of DOPAC (3,4-dihydroxyphenyl acetic acid) in the prefrontal cortex (test carried out according to B.A. Morrow et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol., 1993, 238, 255-262) . This increase is blocked by a specific antagonist of the NK2 receptors such as saredutant (X. Emonds-Alt et al., Life Sci., 1992, 50, PL101-PL106) and is consequently mediated by the activation of the NK2 receptors by the endogenous neurokinin A. It is observed that the compound of Example 1 administered at 1 mg/kg by the<br>
intraperitoneal route completely blocks this increase.<br>
In guinea pigs, a treatment with haloperidol, administered at a dose of 1 mg/kg by the<br>
intraperitoneal route, causes an increase in the number of dopaminergic neurons which are spontaneously active (population response) in the A10 region (VTA, ventral tegmental area) of the brain, measured in electrophysiology. This increase is mediated by the activation of the NK3 receptors by endogenous neurokinin B (C. Gueudet et al., Synapse, 1999, 3J3' 71-79). It is observed that the compound of Example 1 administered at 0.1-1 mg/kg by the intraperitoneal route blocks this increase.<br>
All these pharmacological results show that the compounds according to the invention, in particular the compound of Example 1, are mixed antagonists of the NK2 receptors and of the NK3 receptors by blocking the pharmacological effects caused by neurokinin A or neurokinin B, whether they are applied exogenously or whether their endogenous release is provoked. Furthermore, these results show that the compounds according to the invention cross the blood-brain barrier well.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are in particular active ingredients of pharmaceutical compositions, whose toxicity is compatible with their<br>
use as a medicament.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) above may be used at daily doses of 0.01 to 100 mg per kilo of bodyweight of the mammal to be treated, preferably at daily doses of 0.1 to 5 0 rag/kg. In human beings, the dose may preferably vary from 0.1 to 4 000 mg per day, more particularly from 0.5 to 1 000 mg depending on the age of the subject to be treated or the type of treatment: prophylactic or curative.<br>
For their use as medicaments, the compounds of formula (I) are generally administered in the form of dosage units. The said dosage units are preferably formulated in pharmaceutical compositions in which the active ingredient is mixed with one or more pharmaceutical excipients.<br>
Thus, according to another of its aspects, the present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing, as active ingredient, a compound of formula (I) or one of its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates and/or hydrates.<br>
In the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention for administration by the oral, sublingual, inhaled, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, transdermal, local or rectal route, the active ingredients may be administered in unit forms for administration, in a mixture with conventional<br>
pharmaceutical carriers, to animals and to human beings. The appropriate unit forms for administration comprise the forms by the oral route such as tablets, gelatin capsules, powders, granules and oral solutions or suspensions, the forms for sublingual and buccal administration, aerosols, the forms for topical administration, implants, the forms for subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intranasal or intraocular administration and the forms for rectal administration.<br>
When a solid composition is prepared in the form of tablets or gelatin capsules, there are added to the active ingredient, micronized or otherwise, a mixture of pharmaceutical excipients which may be composed of diluents such as for example lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, starch, dicalcium phosphate, binders such as for example polyvinylpyrrolidone, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, disintegrating agents such as crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone, crosslinked carboxymethyl cellulose, glidants such as silica, talc, lubricants such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid, glycerol tribehenate, sodium stearyl fumarate.<br>
Wetting agents or surfactants such as sodium lauryl sulphate, polysorbate 80, poloxamer 188 may be added to the formulation.<br>
The tablets may be prepared by various<br>
techniques, direct compression, dry granulation, wet granulation, hot-melt.<br>
The tablets may be uncoated or coated with sugar (for example with sucrose) or coated with various polymers or other appropriate materials.<br>
The tablets may have a flash, delayed or prolonged release by preparing polymeric matrices or using specific polymers in the film-coating.<br>
The gelatin capsules may be soft or hard, film-coated or otherwise so as to have a flash, prolonged or delayed activity (for example by an enteric form).<br>
They may not only contain a solid formulation formulated as above for the tablets, but also liquids or semisolids.<br>
A preparation in syrup or elixir form may contain the active ingredient together with a sweetener, preferably calorie-free, methylparaben and propylparaben as antiseptic, as well as a taste enhancer and an appropriate colouring agent.<br>
The powders or granules dispersible in water may contain the active ingredient in a mixture with dispersing agents, wetting agents or suspending agents, such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, as well as with sweeteners or flavour correctors.<br>
For rectal administration, suppositories are<br>
used which are prepared with binders which melt at rectal temperature, for example cocoa butter or polyethylene glycols.<br>
For parenteral, intranasal or intraocular administration, aqueous suspensions, isotonic saline solutions or sterile and injectable solutions are used which contain pharmacologically compatible dispersing agents and/or solubilizing agents, for example propylene glycol.<br>
Thus, to prepare an aqueous solution which can be injected by the intravenous route, it is possible to use a cosolvent such as, for example, an alcohol such as ethanol or a glycol such as polyethylene glycol or propylene glycol, and a hydrophilic surfactant such as polysorbate 80 or poloxamer 188. To prepare an oily solution which can be injected by the intramuscular route, it is possible to solubilize the active ingredient with a triglyceride or a glycerol ester.<br>
For local administration, creams, ointments, gels, collyria and sprays may be used.<br>
For transdermal administration, it is possible to use patches in multilaminated form or with a reservoir in which the active ingredient may be in alcoholic solution, or sprays.<br>
For administration by inhalation,' an aerosol<br>
is used which contains for example sorbitan trioleate or oleic acid as well as trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, Freon substitutes or any other biologically compatible propellant gas; it is also possible to use a  system containing the active ingredient alone or combined with an excipient, in powdered form.<br>
The active ingredient may also be provided in the form of a complex with a cyclodextrin, for example a, (3, y-cyclodextrin, 2-hydroxypropyl-(3-cyclodextrin .<br>
The active ingredient may also be formulated in the form of microcapsules or microspheres, optionally with one or more carriers or additives.<br>
Among the prolonged-release forms which are useful in the case of chronic treatments, implants may be used. These may be prepared in the form of an oily suspension or in the form of a suspension of microspheres in an isotonic medium.<br>
In each dosage unit, the active ingredient of formula (I) is present in quantities appropriate for the daily doses envisaged. In general, each dosage unit is suitably adjusted according to the dosage and the type of administration envisaged, for example tablets, gelatin capsules and the like, sachets, ampoules, syrups and the like, drops such that such a dosage unit contains from 0.1 to. 1 000 mg of active ingredient,<br>
preferably from 0.5 to 250 mg before being administered one to four times a day.<br>
Although these dosages are examples of average situations, there may be particular cases where higher or lower dosages are appropriate; such dosages also belong to the invention. According to the usual practice, the dosage appropriate for each patient is determined by the doctor according to the mode of administration, the age, the weight and the response of the said patient.<br>
According to one of its aspects, the present invention relates to the use of the compounds of formula (I), or of one of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates and/or hydrates for the preparation of medicaments intended for treating any pathology where either neurokinin A and/or NK2 receptors, or neurokinin B and/or NK3 receptors, or both neurokinin A and neurokinin B and/or NK2 and NK3 receptors are involved.<br>
