				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates generally to water purification and to water puritication units. The invention also relates to novel materials that can be used in water purification systems. More particularly, the present invention relates to a novel form of activated carbon and to a novel porous ceramic element which can be employed in a water purification system to produce water of high purity.<br>
The use of activated carbon in water purification systems to remove organic contaminants and chlorine contained in the water is conventional. The activated carbon is typically granular, but it can also be powdered and cast into porous blocks or cylinders.<br>
Water purification systems comprising porous ceramic filter elements arc also known. The ceramic filter elements in these systems typically comprise pores having a size across their largest dimension in the range of from 0.7 to 1.0 micron (urn). The size of the pores is small enough to remove 99.0 to 99.9% of most pathogenic bacteria, but it is not small enough to guarantee protection from water borne diseases. Furthermore, although it is possible to make ceramic filter elements with smaller pore sizes, e.g. down to 0.2 micron, these elements tend to be too fragile to be safely used in water purification systems where a crack in the element could be fatal.<br>
It is also known to use redox alloys of zinc and copper in the purification of water These materials exhibit the ability to remove toxic metal ions and   chlorine contaminating water   by   losing electrons to or gaining<br>
electrons from the contaminants. However, the alloys sutler from the disadvantage that they release zinc and copper into the water which are themselves detrimental to human health and, therefore, can only be used in small quantities.<br>
Other known methods for sterilising water involve the use of chlorine, iodine, ozone and ultra violet radiation.<br>
We have now developed a novel form of activated carbon and a novel porous ceramic element which can be usefully employed in a water purification system to produce water of high purity.<br>
According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a particulate activated, carbon con&amp;kiing particles of water insoluble ash in an amount of at least 1 % by weight as determined in accordance with ASTM 2866.<br>
According to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided a filter comprising the activated carbon of the first aspect of the present invention. This filter is preferably a water filter and typically takes the form of a filter cartridge comprising a chamber which contains the activated carbon as a bed or layer.<br>
The activated carbon of the present invention has an affinity for positively charged metal ions (cations), such as chromium and zinc, which can have<br>
certain advantages when the carbon is used in a water purification system alongside a redox alloy. These advantages are discussed hereinafter. Preferably, the activated C2irbon has an affinity for zinc.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the particulate activated carbon is in platelet form. The platelets of activated carbon preferably have a mean thickness in the range of from 0.02 to 0.2 mm, a mean particle size across their largest dimension in the range of from 0.2 to 0.6 mm and an aspect ratio (by which is meant lie ratio of the largest dimension to the thickness for the platelets) in the range of from 20:1 to 10:3. More preferably, the activated carbon platelets Lave a mean thickness in the range of from 0.05 to 0.1 mm; a mean particle, size across their largest dimension in the range of from 0.25 to 0.55 mm, particularly in the range of from 0.32 to 0.52 mm; and an aspect ratio in the range of from 25:2 to 4:1, particularly in the range of from 10:1 to 20:3.<br>
The ash which is contained in the activated carbon of the present invention is a fully combusted residue which is produced as a result of tie small amount of oxygen which is present during the activation process.<br>
The ash content of the activated carbon determined in accordance with ASTM 2866 is preferably in the range of from 1 to 20 % by weight, more preferably in the range of from 2 to 12 % by weight, particularly in the range of from 3 to 7 % by weight and especially in the range of from 4 to 6 % by weight, e.g. 5 to 6 % by weight. The ash is preferably constituted by substantially spherical particles and these particles typically have a mean size across their largest dimension in the range of from 0.1 to 1.0<br>
µm, preferably in the range of from 0.2 to 0.5 u,m and particularly in the range of from 0.3 to 0.4 urn. ASTM 2866 can be found in Coal ASTM Book of Standards.<br>
The iodine number of the activated carbon is typically in the range: of from 1000 to 1400 mg/g, preferably in the range of from 1100 to 1300 mg/g and particularly in the range of from 1250 to 1300 mg/g.<br>
The activated carbon also preferably has a specific surface area as determined in accordance with the nitrogen BET isotherm method in the range of from 1000 to K00 m2/g, more preferably in the range of from 1100 to 1300 m2/g and particularly in the range of from 1175 to 1200 m2/g; a pore volume as determined in accordance with ASTM 3838 in die range of from 0.5 to 0.7 ml/g, more preferably in the range of from 0.55 to 0.65 ml/g and particularly in the range of from 0.6 to 0.62 ml/g; a hardness as determined in accordance with ASTM 3802 in the range of from 90 to 100%, more preferably in the range of from 95 to 100 % and particularly in the range of from 98 to 100 %; a K value gold loading as determined in accordance with the AARL method in the range of from 15 to 30 mg Au/g, more preferably in the range of from 20 to 25 mg Au/g and particularly in die range of from 23 to 25 mg Au/g; and an R value gold kinetics as determined in accordance with the AARL method in the range of from 45 to 75 %, more preferably in the range of from 50 to 70 % and particularly in the range of from 55 to 60 %.<br>
The activated carbon of the present invention may, in principle, be derived from various sources, but it is preferably derived from coconut shells by<br>
burning the shells to produce carbon and then subjecting the resulting coconut shell carbon to an activation process in which it is superheated in an environment typically obtaining up to 5000 parts per million (ppm) by volume of oxygen. Although the environment in which the aestivation process is conducted will typically contain less than 5000 ppm by volume of oxygen, a small amount of oxygen is nonetheless necessary to produce the required ash content.<br>
Thus, according to a third aspect of the present invention there is provided a process for preparing an activated carbon which process comprises treating carbon produced from the combustion of coconut shells to an activation process in which it is heated to a temperature in the range of from 1000 to 3500 "C in an environment containing less than 5000 ppm by volume of oxygen for a time in the range of from 10 to 50 minutes.<br>
The activation process is typically conducted using a superheated gas, preferably superheated steam, and in a preferred embodiment is conducted at a temperature in the range of from 2000 to 3500°C, more preferably in the range of from 2800 to 3100°C and particularly in the range of from 2950 to 3000°C.<br>
The duration of the activation process has also been found to be important and is preferably conducted for a time in die range of from 15 to 45 minutes, more preferably in the range of from 25 to 35 minutes and particularly in the range of from 28 to 32 minutes. Obviously, the duration of the activation process to which the coconut shell carbon is subjected will to some extent depend on the temperature employed in the process. However, the duration of the activation process is typically considerably<br>
longer than the duration of conventional activation processes and unlike conventional activation processes the aim is to produce an activated carbon having the required ash content. In conventional activation processes, the aim is to avoid ash formation altogether.<br>
Preferably the environment in which the activation process is conducted contains from 1 to 2000, more preferably from 1 to 500 and particularly from 5 to 50 ppm by volume of oxygen.<br>
The activation process may be conducted in any suitable activatior. furnace or kiln of the type which is commercially used to prepare the known granular form of activated carbon.<br>
The conversion of the activated carbon of the invention to a platelet form can be accomplished by the known industrial process of chellation<br>
According to a fourth aspect of the present invention there is provided a porous ceramic filter element comprising a plurality of pores, a proportion of which pores are partially occluded with particles laving a size across their largest dimension which is smaller than the si2e of the pores across their largest dimension to give pores having an effective size across their largest dimension which is smaller than the true size across their largest dimension.<br>
It has been found that the porous ceramic element of the invention may provide for effective bacterial control along with an acceptable rate of water flow under normal water pressure conditions.<br>
The porous ceramic element of the present invention typically comprises pores having a mean size across their largest dimension in the range of from 0.2 to 1.2 µm, preferably in the range of from 0.2 to 0.9 µm, more preferably in the range of from 0.3 to 0.8 and particularly in the range of from 0.5 to 0.7 µm.<br>
The porous ceramic element also preferably has a total porosity in the range of from 30 to 80 %, preferably in the range of from 45 to 75 %, more preferably in die range of from 50 to 70 % and particularly in the range of from 58 to 62 %.<br>
A proportion of the pores in the ceramic element are partially occluded with particles. Typicially, these particles have a mean size across their largest dimension in the range of from 0.1 to 1.0 µ.m, preferably in the range of from 0.2 to 0.5 µm and particularly in the range of from 0.3 to 0.4 µm to give pores having an effective mean size across their largest dimension in the range of from 0.09 to 0.7 µm, preferably in die tange of from 0.2 to 0.5 m, more preferably in the range of from 0.2 to 0.4 \m\ and particularly in the range of from 0.2 to 0.35 µm. In this way, the filtering capability of the ceramic element is enhanced because the partially occluded pores can provide for the removal of foreign materials contained in water down to the effective pore size. Preferably the occluding particles are substantially spherical in shape.<br>
The pores in die ceramic element preferably have a generally eye: shaped cross-section and the occluding particles are preferably substantially spherical and of a size that they lodge in the corners of the eye shaped pores in the ceramic clement.<br>
The porous ceramic element of the present invention can be made from porous ceramic filter elements of the type that are conventionally used for the purification of water. These elements typically have pore sizes in the range of from 0.3 to 0.9 µm, e.g. in the range of from 0.5 to 0.7 Jim.<br>
The partial occlusion of some of the pores in the ceramic element may be achieved by means of a discrete processing step which is conducted before the element is put to its intended use.<br>
However, when the ceramic element is to be incorporated in a water purification system, lite partial occlusion is preferably conducted in situ by connecting the ceramic element and a filter containing the activated carbon of the first aspect of the present invention in series so that the ceramic element is located downstream of the filter containing the activated carbon. In this way, water passing through the filter containing the activated carbon entrains at least some of the insoluble ash particles contained in the activated carbon and carries these particles to the porous ceramic element where they are deposited in the pores located in the regions of the element whe:re the water enters thereby providing for partial occlusion of those pores.<br>
Accordingly, in a fifth aspect of the present invention there is provided a water purification system comprising an activated carbon filter according to the second aspect of the present invention and a porous ceramic filter element according to the fourth aspect of the present invent .on, the activated carbon filler and the ceramic filter element being connected in series, e g. by an arrangement of conduits, with the ceramic filter clement being located downstream of the activated carbon filter so that in use<br><br>
water passes sequentially through the activated carbon filter and then through the ceramic filter element.<br>
The activated carbon filter of the second aspect of the present invention typically takes the form of a filter cartridge comprising a chamber which contains the activated carbon as a bed or layer. The filter cartridge is preferably cylindrical. The activated carbon may form a bed in the filter cartridge and the configuration of the cartridge may be such thai in use water is caused to flow longitudinally through the bed of activated carbon as it passes from one end of the cartridge to the other. Alternatively, the filter cartridge may have a tubular configuration in which the activated carbon forms an annular layer between inner and outer sleeves of a porous, water permeable material so that in use water is caused to flow laterally through the activated carbon as it passes from the inside of the filter cartridge to the outs:de or vice versa. The filter cartridge may be provided with an inlet and outlet connecter to which conduits for conveying water to .and from the cartridge can be attached. Alternatively, the filter cartridge may be adapted to fit into a filter housing which is provided with the Met aid outlet connectors and is adapted to convey water to and from the filter cartridge containing the activated carbon.<br>
The ceramic filter element also typically locates in a filter housing comprising inlet and outlet connectors for connection to conduits for conveying water to and from the filter. The ceramic filter element is preferably treated with a sterilising agent, usually silver, to prevent microorganisms from colonising the element.<br>
When the water purification system of (he present invention is used for the first time, a proportion of the insoluble ash particles contained in the activated carbon are entrained by die water flowing through the activated carbon and are transported to the porous ceramic element where they are deposited to produce a porous ceramic element according to the: fourth aspect of the present invention in which a proportion of the pore&gt; in the ceramic element are partially occluded by the ash particles. The pores which are partially occluded tend to reside in the region where the water being purified enters the ceramic element.<br>
The water purification sysi:em of the present also preferably comprises a redox alloy filter which is located upstream of the activated carbon filter of the second aspect of the present invention so that in use water exiting the redox alloy filter then passes onto the activated carbon filter.<br>
The redox alloy is a granular material and is preferably an alloy of zinc and copper. Preferred n^dox alloys of zinc and copper are those comprising from 30 to 70 weight % of the zinc and from 70 to 30 weight % of the copper, more preferably from 40 to 60 weight % of the sine and from 60 to 40 weight % of the copper and particularly about 50 weight % of both zinc and copper. An especially preferred redox alloy of 2 zinc and copper is that sold under the trade mark KDF-55 (available fro 11 KDF Fluid Systems Inc).<br>
The redox alloy filter typk:ally forms part of a filter cartridge comprising a chamber which contains the redox alloy as a bed or layer. The filter cartridge is preferably cylindrical. The redox alloy may form a bed in the filter cartridge and the con figuration of the cartridge may be such that in<br>
use water is caused to flow longitudinally through the bed of redox alloy as it passes from one end of the cartridge to the other. Alternatively, the filter cartridge may have a tubular configuration in which the redox alloy forms an annular layer between inner and outer sleeves of a porous, water permeable material so that in use water is caused to flow laterally through the redox alloy as it passes from the inside of the filter cartridge to the outside or vice versa. The filter cartridge may be provided with an inlet and outlet connector to which conduits for conveying water to and from the cartridge can be attached. Alternatively, the filter cartridge may be adapted to fit into a filter housing which is provided with the inlet and outlet connectors and is adapted to convey water to and from the filter cartridge containing the redox alloy.<br>
We do not, of course, exclude the possibility that the redox alloy filter and the activated carbon filter of the second aspect of the present invention may be incorporated into a single filter cartridge, and it is a simple matter to arrange the beds or layers of redox alloy and activated carbon so that the water being purified flows firstly through the redox alloy aid then through the activated carbon.<br>
In conventional water purification systems, redox alloys, which are used to remove toxic metal ions and chlorine, can only be used in small quantities because they release zinc and copper into the water which are themselves detrimenral to human health. In contrast, we have found that redox alloys can be used in much greater quantities in the water purification system of the present invention, therefore allowing for the removal of much greater quantities of toxic metal ions and chlorine, because the activated carbon filter of the second aspect of the present<br>
invention which follows trie redox alloy filter can sequester or mop up the metals, e.g. zinc and copper, which are released into the water by the redox alloy.<br>
The water purification system of the present also preferably comprises a second activated carbon filter which is located downstream of the ceramic filter element so that in use water exiting the ceramic filter element passes onto the second activated carbon filter. The activated carbon which is used in the second activated (Carbon filter should be of the type which is conventionally used in water purification systems for removing organic compounds and is typically cast into a porous block.<br>
The second activated carbon filter typically locates in a filter housing comprising inlet and outlet connectors for connection to conduits for conveying water to and from the filter.<br>
As stated above, the activated carbon which is used in the second activated carbon filter is typically of a type which is conventionally used in water purification systems for removing organic compounds. However, in conventional water purification systems this type of activated carbon is typically consumed very quickly by removing the chlorine contained in the water. As a result, its effectiveness is very short lived. However, in the water purification system of me present invention, the redox alio / can be used in sufficient quantities to remove all or substantially all of the chlorine so freeing the second activated carbon filter to deal with organics only. These organics include the organic components of any bacteria which decompose within the ceramic element such as endotoxins.<br>
It will be appreciated from the above that a preferred water purification system comprises in sequence (1) a redox alloy filter, (2) an activated carbon filter of the second aspect of the present invention, (3) a ceramic filter element and (4) a second activated carbon filter which are arranged so that in use water passes sequentially through filters (1), (2), (3) and (4). These filters may be incorporated into a single filter cartridge.<br>
The water purification system of the present invention may further comprise an anion resin filter. Where used, this filter will typically be located between the ceramic filter element and the second activated carbon filter.<br>
The water purification system of the present invention may also comprise a pre-filter for removing larger particulate matter, such as sand, grit, rust, soot, peat, moss and algae, These particles will typically have a si^e in the range of from 1 to 100 urn, e.g. in the range of from 5 to 50 µm.<br>
When used, this pre-filter will provide a first coarse filtration step and, therefore, will be located upstream of the activated carbon filter of the second aspect of the present invention, and if the water purification system also comprises a redox alloy filter, then the pre-filter will be located upstream of this filter too.<br>
In the water purification system, die weight ratio of redox alloy to activated carbon in die redox alloy filter and activated carbon filter of the second aspect of the present invention is preferably in the range of from 1:1 to 1:10, more preferably in the range of from 1:1 to 1:2 and particularly in the range of from 1:1.4 to 1:1.6. In an especially preferred<br>
embodiment, for each 250 g of redox alloy which is used, 375 g of the activated carbon is used and this amount of carbon will contain sufficient asb to  partially occlude 0.054 m2 of a 60% porous ceramic containing pores having a mean size across their largest dimension in the range of from 0.5 to 0.7 µm.<br>
The water purification system of the present invention may also comprise<br>
a pump to drive the water to be purified through the arrangement of filters<br>
which follow. This pump can be hand operated or powered, 
electricity or an internal combustion engine.	<br>
The present invention relates to a water purification system comprising an activated carbon filter and a redox alloy filter which is located upstream of the activated carbon filter so that in use water exiting the redox alloy filter then passes onto the activated carbon filter, wherein the activated carbon is particulate, is able to sequester zinc and copper, contains particles of water insoluble ash in an amount of at least 1% by weight as determined in accordance with ASTM 2866 and is obtainable by a process which comprises subjecting carbon produced from the combustion of coconut shells to an activation process in which it is heated to a temperature in the range of from 1000 to 3500°C in an environment containing from 1 to 2000 parts per million (ppm) by volume of oxygen for a time in the range of from 10 to 50 minutes, and wherein the weight ratio of redox alloy to activated carbon in the redox is alloy filter and the activated carbon filter is in the range of from 1:1 to 1:2.<br>
The present invention also relates to a method for purifying water, the method comprising passing the water through a redox alloy filter and then through an activated carbon filter in which the activated carbon is particulate, is able to sequester zinc and copper, contains particles of water insoluble ash in an amount of at least 1 % by weight as determined in accordance with ASTM 2866 and is obtainable by a process which comprises subjecting carbon produced from the combustion of coconut shells to an activation process in which it is heated to a temperature in the range of from 1000 to 3500C in an environment containing from 1 to 2000 parts per million (ppm) by volume of oxygen for a time in the range of from 10 to 50 minutes, wherein the weight ratio of redox alloy to activated carbon in the redox alloy filter and the activated carbon filter is in the range of from 1:1 to 1:2.<br>
The present invention will now be described by way of example and with reference to the enclosed drawings in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic representation of a water purification systero of the present invention showing the arrangement of the various filters.<br>
In Figure 1, the water purification system (1) comprises a redox alloy filter (2), an activated carbon filter (3) according to the second aspect of the present invention, a porous ceramic filter element (4) according to the fourth aspect of the present invention and a porous carbon block filter element (5).<br>
The redox alloy filter (2) and the activated carbon filter (3) are combined in a single, cylindrically shaped filter cartridge comprising a chamber in which the activated carbon and die redox alloy are arranged as discrete beds so that in use me water being purified flows longitudinally through the filter beds as it passes from one end of die filter cartridge to the  other.<br><br>
The filter cartridge fits into a first, cylindrically shaped filter housing (not shown) which is provided with inlet and outlet connectors at its ends for connection to conduits for conveying water to and from die filters (not shown). The first filter housing is adapted to convey water to and from the filter cartridge so that it passes firstly through the redox alloy bed and then through the activated carbon bed.<br>
The porous ceramic, filter element (4) is cylindrically shaped arid has a tubular configuration. The porous carbon block filter element (5) is also cylindrically shaped and is; located in the central chamber provided by the tubular ceramic filter element (4), The diameter of the porous carbon block filter clement (5) is such that it is a close fit inside the ceramic filter element (4) and the complete filter assembly locates inside a second, cylindrically shaped filter housing (not shown) comprising inlet and outlet connectors for connection to conduits for conveying water to aid from the filters (not shown). The second filter housing is adapted so that water is caused to pass laterally through the ceramic filter element (4) and then onto the carbon filter element (5) where it flows in a generally longitudinal direction towards the outlet end of the filter housing.<br>
The first filter housing containing the redox alloy filter (2) and the activated carbon filter (3) and the second filler housing containing die porous ceramic filter element (4) and die porous carbon block filter element (5) are connected in scries by an arrangement of conduits (not shown) with die second filter housing being located downstream of the first filter housing so that in use water passes sequentially through the redox alloy filter (2), the activated carbon filter (3), die porous ceramic<br>
filter element (4) and the porous carbon block filter element (5). The first filter housing is then connected to a source of water to be purified.<br>
In use the flow of water through the water purification system is generally as shown by the emboldened arrows.<br>
The present invention is now illustrated but not limited with reference to die following examples.<br>

The water purification system described above with reference to Figure 1 was used to purify 10,000 litres of tap water contaminated with the following impurities.<br>
Chlorine (Cl2~) ions - 10 mg/I Iron (Fe2-1") ions - 50 mg/1 Lead (Pb2+) ions - 100 ug/1 Aluminium (Al3/) - 100 jig/1 Chloroform -10 mg/I Trichloroe^hane - 10 mg/1<br>
The activated carbon filter (3) comprised a bed of activated carbon platelets which had a mean thickness of about 0.1 mm, a mean particle size across their largest dimension of about 0.5 mm and an aspect ratio of about 5:1. The activated carbon contained particles of water insoluble ash in an amount of about 6.0 % by weight as determined in accordance with ASTM 2866. The ash particles were substantially spherical having a<br>
mean size across their largest dimension of about 0.3 µm. The activated carbon also had the following properties:<br>
