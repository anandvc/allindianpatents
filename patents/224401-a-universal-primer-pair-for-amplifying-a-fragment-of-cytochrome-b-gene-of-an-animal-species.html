				<td>UNIVERSAL PRIMERS FOR WILDLIFE IDENTIFICATION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The invention relates to the identification of novel universal primers that can amplify the<br>
fragment of cytochrome b gene of any animal species in polymerase chain reaction (PCR)<br>
and reveal the identity of the biological material of any unknown animal origin at species<br>
and sub-species sources. The invention also provides a method for the identification of<br>
fragments on mitochondria! cytochrome b gene in biological material of unknown origin.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
A large number of studies in evolutionary biology utilize phylogenetic information<br>
obtained from mitochondria! cytochrome b gene. It has been identified a potent molecule<br>
to distinguish the phylogenetic depth of different lineages to family, genus and species in<br>
molecular taxonomy1'46. A vast database of the sequences of cytochrome b gene of<br>
different animal species has accumulated in public databases such as GenBank, NCBI<br>
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) etc. We have utilized this capacity of cytochrome b gene in<br>
establishing the identity of the origin of animal parts and product to its family, genus and<br>
â€¢ species sources. The technique developed is based on a pair of universal primer that can<br>
amplify a small fragment of cytochrome b gene from a vast range of animal species.<br>
Establishing identity of confiscated animal parts and products is a great challenge to law<br>
enforcement agencies because none of the methods available till date is too efficient to<br>
reveal the identity of animal remains beyond a reasonable doubt. Morphological markers,<br>
described for certain species allow the identification of complete specimen of animals<br>
However, a complete specimen is confiscated very rarely by the investigation agencies;<br>
therefore, these marker are not practical in wildlife forensics. The biochemical traits such<br>
as the bile characteristics68 blood heam analysis69'70 etc. have also been employed in<br>
wildlife forensic for identification of individual species. The difficulty of these markers<br>
are that these markers are limited in number and are rarely found in their natural forms in<br>
which these were originally described as the characteristic of a particular species.<br>
The molecular approaches such as micro-satellite based identification , Restriction<br>
fragment length polymorphism analysis of mitochondrial genes or PCR based species<br>
specific STS markers require the prior information of the species to establish the<br>
identity72'73. These methods also need a significant amount of DNA material to be<br>
analysed. We may not have the prior information about the species origin of confiscated<br>
animal parts and product in forensics. therefore, these methods arc not really useful and<br>
practical in wildlife identification. The technique invented fay us is universal, therefore<br>
does not require any background information to establish the identity of any unknown<br>
confiscated remains at family, genus and species sources. Being a PCR based procedure it<br>
can be applied with trace amount of any biological material. Because the amplicon length<br>
is small (472 bp); therefore, it can work perfectly with the mutilated remains, which are<br>
commonly seized by the crime investigation agencies. It does not require the large amount<br>
of genetic material i.e. DNA to be analyzed to establish the identity, hence, can detect a<br>
minute amount of adulteration in food products. The procedure described is simple and<br>
very fast. Due to the said advantages, the procedure invented by us is most suited for<br>
forensic wildlife identification.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main object of the invention is to identify a fragment on mitochondrial cytochrome b<br>
gene capable of significantly discriminating among various evolutionary lineages of<br>
different animal species.<br>
Another object is to identify a fragment on mitochondrial cytochrome b gene which is<br>
flanked by the highly conserved sequences at a vast range of animal species.<br>
Yet another object is to detect a fragment on mitochondrial cytochrome b gene which is<br>
polymorphic inter-specifically, but monomorphic at intra species sources.<br>
Still another object is to develop the universal primers to amplify the fragment on<br>
mitochondrial cytochrome b gene using polymerase chain reaction.<br>
Another object is to develop a PCR protocol that works universally with DNA template of<br>
any unknown origin (i.e. ail the animal species).<br>
Yet another object is to provide a universal method for identification of species of analyzed<br>
material (i.e. the DNA isolated from confiscated animal remain of unknown origin) using<br>
the public databases such as GenBank, NCBl etc.<br>
Still another object is to provide a universal method of animal identification to establish<br>
the crime with the criminal beyond a reasonably doubt. /<br>
Another object is provide a universal method to establish the identity of biological<br>
materials such as skin, horns etc confiscated from animal poachers, if it is that of an<br>
endangered species.<br>
Yet another object is to provide a universal method for establishment of the identity of<br>
confiscated animal parts and products of endangered animal species for the purpose ol<br>
production of molecular evidence of animal hunting and related crime in the co"i of law,<br>
so that the human violation to the wildlife resources could be controlled.<br>
Still another object is to provide a universal technique to have an idea of the geographical<br>
location of the commitment of wildlife crime based on the haplotype of poached animal -<br>
identified by the universal primer invented.<br>
Another object is to provide a universal technique of animal identification to detect the<br>
adulteration of animal meat/products in vegetarian food product for the purpose of food<br>
fortification, by the food fortification agencies.<br>
Yet another object is to provide a universal technique for detection of the origin of blood<br>
or blood stains etc collected from the scene of crime related to offences such as murder,<br>
rape etc, in order to establish the origin of blood found at scene of crime when it sounds as<br>
if criminals have wontedly spread the blood of an animal at the scene of crime, to confuse<br>
the crime investigation agencies and forensic scientists with human blood.<br>
Another object is to invent and authenticate a universal technique that can be converted to<br>
a (a) 'MOLECUALR KIT' and (b) 'DNA CHIPS' based application to meet the<br>
requirements of above objectives.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the invention provides novel universal primers that can amplify the fragment<br>
of cytochrome b gene of any animal species in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reveal<br>
the identity of the biological material of any unknown animal origin<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Keeping in view the above objectives, the cytochrome b gene sequences (1140 bp) of 221<br>
distantly related animal species (listed in Table 1) representing various families were<br>
obtained from public database NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.goy). These sequences<br>
were aligned using the software Clustal X(l,8)(NCBl, USA) and a fragment (of 472 bp,<br>
alignment shown in Table 2) of gene was identified which had all the features mentioned<br>
above under column I, 2 and 3 of sub-heading 'Objectives of invention'. 
identity of this fragment we would like to mention that it includes the nucleotides between<br>
398 to 869 in Amilope cervicapra and Felis catus; however, 399 to 870 in Homo sapiens<br>
sapiens species. Except at few positions (marked as star (*) in Table 2, the nucleotide<br>
sequences of this fragment are highly variable amongst the animal species, giving rise to<br>
their unique molecular signature. These molecular signatures are characteristic of its<br>
species and form the basis of revealing the identity of the biological material of an<br>
unknown animal origin by the procedure invented by us. Considering Antilope cervicapra<br>
as a representative species, the sequence of this fragment is mentioned herewith.<br>

A pair of universal primer was designed to amplify this fragment in polymerase chain<br>
reaction (PCR). These primers were named as 'mcb398' and 'mcb869' because of its<br>
property to amplify a region of rmtochondrial cytochrome b gene between nucleotides 398<br>
to 8Â£9 ofAntilope cervicapra, a representative animal species for this invention. We took<br>
this animal species as representative species because the idea of developing such a novel<br>
primers came in the mind of inventors while they were working on the genome of this<br>
animal in Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad, India. These primers<br>
work universally because its 3' end are highly conserved amongst a vast range of animal<br>
species (shown in Table 2). As mentioned above, the DNA fragment (sequence of which is<br>
shown above) targeted by these primers is highly polymorphic inter-specifically; however,<br>
iris monomorphic among the individual of same species (Tables 6, 7a, 7b, 7c, -d and 8,<br>
respectively). These unique features of the targeted region enable these primers to generate<br>
the molecular signatures of an individual species; thereby, enabling them to differentiate<br>
amongst the animals of different species (see in Figure Ic). The variation within the<br>
fragment amplified by these pnmers increase with increasing distances of evolutionary<br>
lineages of two animals (Table 8). These unique features of the fragment amplified by the<br>
universal primers 'mcb398' and 'mcb869' invented by the applicants fulfill the objectives<br>
of invention.<br>
Thus, the primers invented by us can generate the molecular signature from any biological<br>
material of unknown animal origin, which actually is the characteristic of its family, genus<br>
and more precisely, the species. When these signatures are compared in-silico with the<br>
signatures already available in public databases (viz., GenBank, NCBl database etc) using<br>
'BLAST software71, it indicates identity of the family, genus or species of the analyzed<br>
material, which in turn is confirmed practically by comparing with the reference animals of<br>
the revealed family, genus or species, by including them in the further analysts by the<br>
primers 'mcb398' and 'mcb869'. The complete procedure involved in the analyses (the<br>
word, 'analyses' should be understood with the stepwise procedure to establish the identity<br>
of the biological remain of any unknown animal origin for the aims mentioned in columns<br>
The animals belonging to similar species cluster together; however, the animals of<br>
different species group in different clusters. The confiscated material under investigation<br>
(i.e. 'adil.flesh') clusters with 'gzlL' (i.e. the known normal leopard 'Panthera pardus')<br>
indicating the identity of the species of 'adil.flesh' as that of a Panthera pardus source.<br>

are the molecular basis of identification of individual animal species using our primers<br>
Itncb398' and 'mcb869'.<br>

different animal species investigated along with 'adil.flesh', the confiscated skin of<br>

which are not marked with star (*) symbol in Table 6), amongst the 328 bp fragment<br>
revealed from the animals listed in Table 5. The dot (.) mark represents the presence of the<br>
similar nucleotide as listed in lane 1 i.e. the sequence from "adil.flesh' at that position. It<br>
demonstrates that the signatures of each species are unique and specific to its species. The<br>
molecular signatures of 'adilflesh' are comparable (except for position 37 which has a<br>
transition from *T* to 'C') to the molecular signature of 'gzlL' i.e. the known leopard<br>
'Panthera pardus' source, indicating the identity of the source of confiscated skin<br>
'adil.flesh' as that of a leopard 'Panthera pardus' source. The nucleotide variations (at the<br>
positions 153, 198, 223, 264, among the known leopards, (i.e. gzlL, gz2L, and gz3L,<br>
respectively)), give an idea about the geographical habitat of each animals. Various studies<br>
referring to mokvular evolution of different animal species support this hypothesis75;<br>
however, it could further be confirmed by taking the reference animals from different<br>
geographical areas and analyzing by our primers 'mcb 398* and 'mcb869'. If we could<br>
generate the database of different haplotypes (i.e. habitat specific molecular signatures) of<br>
the animal species, it would also enable our primers to reveal the geographical location of<br>
the commitment of wildlife crime.<br>
Table 8. Percent similarity matrix calculated by pair-vise comparisons of nucleotide<br>
sequences aligned (illustrated in Table 6). The cytochrome b gene sequence of DNA<br>
isolated from confiscated material had maximum similarity (99.7% and 98.2%, with the<br>
lineages of animals 'gz2L' and 'gz3L\ respectively) with the sequences obtained from<br>
known normal leopard source, indicating its identity as that of a leopard origin. The<br>
similarity matrix has been calculated using the software PHYLIP (3.5).<br>

The mitochondria! cytochrome b gene has very widely been used in molecular taxonomic<br>
studies. It has immense capabilities to reveal different evolutionary lineages of animals in<br>
family, genus and species specific manner. It has also been used to classify the population<br>
of a particular species according to its demographic distributions75. The vast database of<br>
cytochrome b sequences of different animal species has accumulated in public databases<br>
such as Genbank and NCBI1"*5. We have explored these unique characteristics of<br>
cytochrome b gene to establish the identity of confiscated remains of any unknown animal<br>
by inventing a pair of novel primers, 'mdxVJi}' and 'rncb869', that can amplify a small<br>
fragment (472 bp) of cytochrome b gene of wide range of animal species in universal<br>
manner. These primers work universally because its 3' ends target within a highly<br>
conserved region.<br>
The fragment of cytochrome b gene identified had all the features mentioned in columns 1,<br>
2 and 3 listed under sub-heading 'Objective of invention'. We identified this fragment by<br>
aligning the cytochrome b gene sequences (1140 bp) of 221 different animal species listed<br>
in Table I. These sequences are publicly available in NCBI DNA databases. These<br>
sequences were aligned using the software CLUSTAL X (1.8). As mentioned before, the<br>
472 bp fragment of cytochrome b gene identified by us to have the features mentioned in<br>
columns 1, 2 and 3 listed under sub-heading 'Objective of invention' includes the<br>
nucleotides between 398 to 869 in Anlilope cervicupra and Felts cattts; however, 399 to<br>
870 in Homo sapiens sapiens species. Except at few positions (marked as star (*) in Table<br>
2. the nucleotide sequences of this fragment are highly variable amongst the animal<br>
species, revealing the identity of the biological material belonging to that of an unknown<br>
animal origin by the procedure invented by us. As for identity of this fragment we arc<br>
considering Antilope cervicapra as a representative species, and the sequence the above<br>
fragment of cytochrome b gene of Antilope cervicapra is mentioned herewith:<br>

Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 (Central Act NO 53 of 1972). These species are marked<br>
with symbol (*) in Table 1. The NCBI accession number refers to its registration number<br>
in NCBI database and the number in superscript represent the reference cited. Based on the<br>
aligned cytochrome b sequences of different 221 animal species the primers designed were<br>
as follow:<br>
Primers name Sequence (i -y)<br>
'mcb398' "TACCATGAGGACAAATATCATTCTG"<br><mcfa869> "CCTCCTAGnTGTTAGGGATTGATCG"<br>
Tables 2, 10 and 11, respectively, demonstrates that the 3' ends of the primers are highly<br>
conserved amongst ail the animal species analyzed in-silico (In total 221 animal species<br>
listed in Table 1 and about 500 species listed in Tables 10 and 11, respectively) Also, the<br>
5' end of the primers were selected within the conserved region of cytochrome b gene to<br>
improve the probability and stability of match of the primers to their target sequences (i.e.<br>
the above mentioned 472 bp fragment of cytochrome b gene). The primers were<br>
thoroughly checked for internal stabilities, loop or dimmer formation using different<br>
software viz.. 'Amplify (1.2)', 'Primer3' (http://w\vw.uenome.wi.mit.alu/cgibin/<br>
primer/primerJ.cgi) as well as manually.. We assigned the P,S score (Probability of<br>
match. Stability of match) to the primers for each template using the software Amplify<br>
(1.2). The higher scores of P and S ensure a good amplification if all other conditions<br>
standard (which arc mentioned under 'Example 3') are optimum. The Highest score tor<br>
'mcb3y8' was 98.63 (i.e. the situation where the primer has perfect match with template):<br>
however, the highest P, S for 'mcb869' was recorded as 98, 68 for a complete match<br>
between the primer and template. The lowest P,S score observed for 'mcb398' was 81,50<br>
for species Talpa europaea whereas 'mcb869' had a high P, S score for this species (92,<br>
57). The another species which have lowest P, S score for one of the two primers were<br>
Eumeces egregious and Equus ainus. Eumeces egregious had P, S score 86, 55 and 73,51<br>
for 'mcb398' and 'mcb869', respectively, however, the P, S score of Equus ainus was<br>
calculated as 91,61 and 73, 51 for Imcb398' and 'mcb869', respectively. All other animals<br>
had higher P, S scores then the above mentioned species. To ensure that these primers<br>
would work efficiently with the DNA template from the animals having the lowest P, S<br>
score tor one of the primers, we designed an another experiment to validate the lower<br>
limits of one of the two primers sufficient for efficient amplification in PCR. We designed<br>
an another primer pair (AFF= 5'tagtagaatgaatctgaggagg3' and<br>
AFR=5'atgcaaataggaagtatcattc3'.) having more mis-pairing at their annealing sites (but not<br>
at ends), therefore have less internal stability and lower P, S scores for its templates (listed<br>
in Table 9). The P,S scores of 'AFF' and 'APR' were as calculated as low as 41 and 49 for<br>
Platanista gangetica and Sus scrofa These species were amplified efficiently using the<br>
primers 'AFF' and 'APR' (results shown in Figure 3) (keeping all other conditions<br>
standard . the conditions mentioned in 'Example 3'). The lowest P,S scores (86, 55 and<br>
73,51 for species Eumeces egregious) for our primers 'mcb398' and 'mcb869',<br>
respectively, were higher then the above range of combined P, S scores of 'AFF' and<br>
'AFR' for species Sus scrofa (87, 52 and 87, 41), which was efficiently amplified by the<br>
primers 'AFF' and 'AFR'. It gives an indication that the primers 'mcb 398' and 'mcb 869'<br>
would work with all the species including Eumeces egregious efficiently to give rise to the<br>
expected product in PCR. This experiment confirmed that the primers 'mcb398* and 'mcb<br>
869* are capable of amplifying the cytochrome b fragment of most of the animal species in<br>
a universal manner.<br>
For further confirmation of universal nature of our primers, we blasted the sequence of our<br>
primers against the mito and nr databases of NCBI using BLAST software. The results of<br>
these analyses are shown in Tables 10, and 11. respectively.<br>
Finally, the universal nature of the primers was tested in our laboratory with some more<br>
animal species listed in Table 12. These primers amplified all the animal species<br>
efficiently, giving rise to the band of expected size (472 bp). The results are shown in<br>
Figure 4. This experiments substantiated the results of P.S analysis and other in-silico<br>
analyses to show that the primers 'mcb398'and 'mcb 869' arc universal primers.<br>

of columns 1, 2 and 3 mentioned under sub-heading 'Objectives of invention' of heading<br>
'Brief summary of invention'<br>
The cytochrome b molecule has very vastly been used in molecular taxonomic studies.<br>
Being a slow evolving gene, It has a tremendous infonnation in its nucleotide sequences to<br>
distinguish the animals to their family, genus and species sources1'65. A vast database of<br>
the sequences of cytochrome b gene of different animal species has accumulated in the nr<br>
and mito databases of NCBI. We have explored these qualities of cytochrome b gene to<br>
establish the id?- â€¢/ of confiscated remains of unknown animal origin to its family, genus<br>
and species :ources. For this purpose, we have identified a fragment of cytochrome b gene<br>
which is highly pâ€¢., .orphic inter-specifically, however, it is monomorphic among the<br>
individual of same species, therefore it can group the individual of an unknown species<br>
with the known individuals of reference species to which it belongs. In order to amplify<br>
this fragment from DNA isolated form any unknown origin, it was necessary that it remain<br>
flanked with the highly conserved sequences amongst a vast range of animal families. To<br>
identify such a unique ment within the cytochrome b gene, we aligned the sequences of<br>
221 distantly related animal species (listed in Table 1) representing various families using<br>
software CLUSTAL X (1.8). These sequences were obtained from public database NCBI<br>
 (httD.://www,ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The aligned data was examined carefully for the conserved<br>
sites amongst all the species included in in-silico analysis. We identified a fragment (472<br>
bp) of cytochrome b gene that was fulfilling all the requirements mentioned above and also<br>
under column 1,2 and 3 of sub-heading 'Objectives of invention'.<br>
As for the identity of this fragment we would like to mention that it includes the<br>
nucleotides between 398 to 869 in Antilope cervicapra and Felis catus; however, 399 to<br>
870 in Homo sapiens sapiens species. Except at few positions marked as star (*) in Table<br>
2, the nucleotide sequences of this fragment are highly variable amongst the animal<br>
species, giving rise to their unique molecular signature. These molecular signatures are<br>
characteristic of its species and form the basis of revealing the identity of the biological<br>
material of an unknown animal origin by the procedure invented by us. Considering<br>
Antilope cervicapra as a representative species, the sequence of this fragment is mentioned<br>

Example 2:<br>
Example for development of universal primers to amplify the fragment identified<br>
mentioned under'Example 1'.<br>
A pair of universal primer was designed which has the following features:<br>
1. It targets the fragment identified (mentioned under 'Example I') to amplify it in<br>
polymerase chain reaction (PCR).<br>
2. Its 3' and 5' ends that are highly conserved (marked as star (*) in Table 2),<br>
amongst a vast range of animal species ensuring the amplification of the fragment<br>
mentioned above in a universal manner. The sequencing of the fragment amplified<br>
by these primes reveals the molecular signature of the species of analyzed material,<br>
which on comparison with the sequences of the known reference animals reveals<br>
the identity ur ii" species of unknown biological material under investigation.<br>
3. The tm (melting temperature) of both primers was almost similar (about 58 degree<br>
centigrade) ensuring the significant annealing of both the primers to its template,<br>
therefore significant amplification of targeted region in PCR.<br>
4. The internal stability and P, S, score of the primers were ensured higher while<br>
designing it. The possibilities of internal loop formation, dimmer fonration etc<br>
were also excluded by selecting its sequence uniquely. This ensured that the primer<br>
would be a good primer to be used in PCR for amplification of DNA from<br>
unknown animal origin.<br>
5. The 3' end of the primers were ensured to have either 'G' or *C% to increase the<br>
probability of strong bonding at its 3'ends, which is necessary for efficient<br>
amplification of DNA template in PCR. It also strengthens the universal nature of<br>
the primer.<br>
6. The sequences of trie primers were ensured to be unique so that it does not give rise<br>
to non-specific and spurious products in PCR leading to confusion. U improved the<br>
efficiency and quality of the technique invented by us.<br>
7. These primers were named as 'mcb398' and 'mcb869' because of its property to<br>
amplify a region of mitochondrial cytochrome b gene between nucleotides 3.98 to<br>
869 ofAntilope cervicapra, a representative animal species for this invention. We<br>
took this animal species as representative species because the idea of developing<br>
such a novel primers came in the mind of inventors while they were working on the<br>
genome of this animal in Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad,<br>
India.<br>
8. The sequences of the universal primers invented are as follows:<br>
Primers name Sequence (5 '-3')<br>
'mcb398' "TACCATGAGGACAAATATCATTCTG"<br>
'mcb869* "CCTCCTAGTTTGTTAGGGATTGATCG"<br>
Example 3:<br>
Example for development of universal PCR conditions to ensure the amplification of a<br>
template of any unknown origin in PCR, hence strengthening the universal nature of the<br>
technique invented by us<br>
The PCR conditions developed had the following unique features:<br>
1 These were capable of amplifying the DNA template of any animal origin in an<br>
universal manner using the universal primers mentioned under 'Example 2'.<br>
2. The conditions were selected to ensure the; comparable annealing temperature for<br>
both the primers i.e. Vmcb398' and 'mcb869'.<br>
3. The PCR conditions standardized herewith are universal; therefore, the<br>
possibility of PCR failure with a template of unknown origin due to non-standard<br>
conditions is excluded. It ensures the universal nature of our technique to be used in<br>
wildlife forensics.<br>
4. The universal conditions mentioned above are.'<br>
Amplification reactions should be carried out in 20 \i\ reaction volume containing<br>
approximately 20 n.g of template DNA, lOGym each of dNTPs, 1.25 pmole of each primer,<br>
1.5mM MgCIj, 0.5 unit of Amplify Gold (Perkin-Elmer-Cetus, USA) DNA polymerase<br>
and IX PCR buffer (lOmM Tris-HCI, pH 8.3. and 50mM KG). The ampWfication profiles<br>
followed should be. an initial denaturation at 95nC for 10 min. followed by 35 cycles each<br>
of denaturation at 95Â°C for 45 s. annealing at 51Â°C for 1 min, and extension at 72"C for 2<br>
min. The extension step at 35th cycles should be held for 10 min.<br>
Example 4:<br>
Establishing the universal nature of our primer and experimental evidences to demonstrate<br>
the universal nature of primers:<br>
The universal nature of the primers 'mcb398' and 'mcb 869' was ensured by the following<br>
measures:<br>
(a) Selecting the primers from the aligned cytochrome b gene sequences of 221 animal of<br>
distantly related species:<br>
The cytochrome b gene sequences (1140 bp) were aligned using software CLUSTAL X<br>
(1.8). The region of cytochrome b gene that was most conserved amongst 221 animal<br>
species was selected to design the primers.<br>
(b) Selecting the 3' and 5* ends of the primers at the highly conserved positions of<br>
cytochrome b gene:<br>
The 3' and 5' ends of the primers were ensured to anneal to a highly conserved position<br>
amongst 221 animal species representing a vast range of animal families. It was done to<br>
ensure an efficient amplification of all the species in PCR. These positions are shown with<br>
star (*) mark in Table 2.<br>
(c) Ensuring either 'G' or 'C' at the 3" end of the primers:<br>
It was ensured the primers to have either 'G' or 'C' at its 3' ends as these are the<br>
nuclt..uiucs liiLit ensure the strong bonding at the 3' ends of the primers due to three<br>
hydrogen bonds while pairing with each other. The strong bonding at 3' ends fteips the<br>
primers to anneal properly with its template resulting in significant amplification in PCR.<br>
(d) Selecting the sequences of the primers to ensure a higher internal stability, higher P, S<br>
score, and no primer dimmer and loop formation:<br>
The sequences of the primers were selected to have a high P, S score for a vast range of<br>
animal species (Shown in Table 1). The care was taken to exclude the possibilities of loop<br>
or primer dimmer formation thai could reduce the efficiency of the pnmers in PCR.<br>
(e) Selecting the sequence of the primers with a comparable melting temperature:<br>
The sequences of the primers were selected to have a comparable melting temperature so<br>
that these could work together to amplify a DNA template in PCR at a similar annealing<br>
temperature. The melting temperature of both the primers was about 58 degree centigrade<br>
and the annealing temperature used in PCR is 51 degree centigrade.<br>
Experimental evidences to demonstrate the universal nature of primers:<br>
( I ) Evidence from In-silico analysis :<br>
 (a) Selecting the primers within the most conserved region of mitochondria! cytochrome b<br>
gene<br>
As mentioned above, the primers were designed to anneal within a highly conserved region<br>
of mitochondrial cytochrome b gene fragment of 472 bp. Table 2 presents the alignment of<br>
the above fragment of cytochrome b gene of 221 animal species representing a vast range<br>
of animal families. The conserved positions of nucleotide sequences are shown with star<br>
(*) mark in Table 2<br>
Table 2 also demonstrates that the 3' ends of the primers are highly conserved amongst all<br>
the animal species analyzed in-silico. In the aligned sequences, the conserved nucleotides<br>
are marked with symbol â€¢'*). Also, the 5' end of the primers were selected within the<br>
conserved region of cytochrome b gene to improve the probability and stability of match of<br>
the primers to their targe1 .equences (i.e. the above mentioned 472 bp fragment of<br>
cytochrome b gene). The primers were thoroughly checked for internal stabilities, loop or<br>
dimmer formation using different software viz., 'Amplify (1.2)', 'PrimerS'<br>
(http://www.Eenome.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer/prirner3.cgi) as well as manually.<br>
(b) P, S, score ar alys?<br>
We assigned the P,S score /'^Probability of match, S=Stability of match) to the primers<br>
for each template using the software Amplify (1.2). The higher scores of P and S ensure a<br>
good ampl.M
3') are optimum. The Highest score for 'mcb398' was 98,63 (i.e. the situation where the<br>
primer has perfect match with template); however, the highest P, S for 'mcb869' was<br>
recorded as 98, 68 for a complete match between the primer and template. The lowest P,S<br>
score observed for 'mcb398' was 81,50 for species Talpa europaea whereas 'mcb869' had<br>
a high P, S score for this species (92, 57). The another species which have lowest P, S<br>
score for one of the two primers were Eumeces egregious and Equus ainus. Eumeces<br>
egregious had P, S score 86, 55 and 73,51 for 'mcb398' and 'mcbS69', respectively;<br>
however, the P, S score of Equus aima was calculated as 91,61 and 73, 51 for 'mcb398'<br>
and 'mcb869', respectively. All other animals had higher P, S scores then the above<br>
mentioned species. To ensure that these primers,would work efficiently with the DNA<br>
template from the animals having the lowest P, S score for one of the primers, we designed<br>
an another experiment to validate the lower limits.of one of the two primers sufficient for<br>
efficient amplification in PCR. We designed an another primer pair<br>
(AFF= 5 ctagtagaatgaatctyaggugyr and AFR= 5 tatgcaaataggaagtatcattc3.) that have more<br>
mis-pairing at their annealing sites (but not at ends), therefore have less internal stability<br>
13<br>
and lower P, S scores for its templates (listed in Table 9). The P,S scores of 'Af F' and<br>
'APR' were as calculated as low as 41 and 49 for Platanista gangetica and Sus scrofa<br>
These species were amplified efficiently using the primers 'AFF' and 'AFR' (results<br>
shown in Figure 3) (keeping all other conditions standard i.e. the conditions mentioned in<br>
'Example 3')- The lowest P,S scores (86, 55 and 73,51 for species Eumeces egregious) for<br>
our primers 'mcb398' and *mcb869', respectively, were higher then the above range of<br>
combined P, S scores of 'AFF' and 'APR' for species Sus scrofa (87, 52 and 87, 41),<br>
which was efficiently amplified by the primers 'AFF' and 'AFR'. It gives an indication<br>
that the primers 'mcb 398' and 'mcb 869' would work with all the species deluding<br>
Eumeces egregious efficiently to give rise to the expected product in PCR. This<br>
experiment confirmed that the primers 'mcb398' and 'mcb 869* are capable of amplifying<br>
the cytochrome b fragment of most of the animal species in a universal manner.<br>
Â© BLAST analysis:<br>
The sequences of primers 'mcb398' and 'mcb869' were blasted against mito and nr<br>
databases of NCBI to see its significant alignments with the sequences registered in<br>
GenBank. As expected, the most significant alignments of the sequences were found with<br>
the cytochrome b gene regions (within the 472 bp fragment mentioned in 'Example 1') of<br>
different animal species. This analysis also showed that the 3' as well as 5' ends of the<br>
primers were highly conserved amongst a vast range of animal species, confirming the<br>
universal nature of the primers (Tables 10 and 11, respectively)<br>
(2) Evidence from bench work/experiments done in laboratory conditions:<br>
The DNA from different animals belonging to distantly related species (mentioned in<br>
Table 12) was isolated and subjected to PCR amplification using the primers invented by<br>
us i.e. the primers 4mcb398' and 'mcb869' The PCR products amplified were resolved in<br>
agarose gel by electrophoresis and visualized under UV light. The PCR products of<br>
expected size (472bp) were obtained from all the animals confirming the universal nature<br>
of our primers. These results are shown in Figure 4,<br>

Application of the above information for the objectives mentioned in columns 7-13 under<br>
sub-heading 'Objective of invention' of heading 'Summary of invention'<br>
Example 6:<br>
The actual execution of the technique invented<br>
As a first application and to demonstrate the ease and utility of this method, we<br>
investigated a case of forensic identification submitted at our laboratory to seek scientific<br>
opinion on animal hunting evidence. In this case, we received the half h;;rned re" &gt; a ins of<br>
an unknown animal, confiscated by the crime investigation agencies. The DNA was<br>
isolated from the above material following standard methods74 and subjected to PCR<br>
amplification using the primers mentioned above (viz., 'mcb398' and 'mcb869').<br>
Amplification reactions were carried out in 20 nl reaction volume containing 20 rjg of<br>
template DNA, lOOfim each of dNTPs, 1.25 pmole of each primer, 1.5mM MgCl2.0.5 unit<br>
of Amplify Gold (Perkin-Elmer-Cetus, USA) DNA polymerase and IX PCR buffer<br>
(lOrnM Tris-HG, pH 8.3, and 50mM KC1). The amplification profiles followed were: an<br>
initial denaturation at 95Â°C for 10 min, followed by 35 cycles each of denaturation at 95Â°C<br>
for 45 s, annealing at 51Â°C for I min, and extension at 72Â°C for 2 min. The extension step<br>
at 35"" cycles was held for 10 min.<br>
The PCR products obtained were sequenced in automated work station (ABI Prism 3700,<br>
PE-Biosystems) on both strands in triplicate and the sequence resolved (328 bp, shown in<br>
Figure la) was blasted against mito databases of NCBI using BLAST program73. The most<br>
significant alignment (bits Value 365, E value e"101) of this sequence was produced with<br>
the cytochrome b gene sequence of Felis cutus, (Table 3) indicating that species of<br>
analyzed material belongs to family felidae. Further, the above sequence revealed from the<br>
confiscated remain was blasted against nr databases of NCBI using BLAST program. The<br>
most significant alignment (bits Value 603, E value e"170) of this sequence was produced<br>
with the cytochrome b gene sequence of Panthera pardus (Table 4), indicating the identity<br>
of the analyzed material as that of a Panthera pardus source. Based on this information,<br>
we selected the reference animals listed in Table 5 representing different species and<br>
subspecies of felidae. The DNA isolated from reference animals was amplified and<br>
sequenced on both strands in triplicate using the primer pair mentioned above. Consensus<br>
sequences obtained were aligned using program CLUSTAL X (1.8) (Table 6). Sequence<br>
comparisons identified 113 variable sites in total amongst all animals analyzed 'Table 7).<br>
Pair-vise comparisons of sequences were performed to find out the variation among<br>
different animals investigated. All the species investigated were differentiated by a their<br>
unique nucleotides sequences. The molecular signatures of different reference animals<br>
were compared with the molecular signature of the confiscated skin 'adil.flesh'. Table 7<br>
demonstrate that the maximum similarity of the adil.flesh with 'gzll' i.e. known Leopard<br>
(Panthera pardus) species, indicating the identity of the adil.flesh, the confiscated skin, as<br>
that of a Panthera pardus origin. We also calculated the similarity matrix showing the pairvise<br>
similarity amongst the animal species under investigation using PHYLIP software<br>
Thi.s matrix is -':.' .vn in Table 8. It demonstrates that the animals belonging to different<br>
species had more variation; however, the animals of same species had maximum similarity<br>
among their cytochrome b sequences. The cytochrome b gene sequence of DNA isolated<br>
from confiscated material had maximum similarity with the sequences obtained from<br>
known Leopard source(99.7%, and 98.2 with 'gzll' and 'gz21f, respectively); establishing<br>
the identity of the source of confiscated material as that of a Normal leopard (Penthera<br>
pardus) species. The step-vise procedure involved in above analysis is illustrated in Figure<br>
la, Iband ic, respectively.<br>
Thus, the primers invented by us can generate the molecular signature from any biological<br>
material of unknown animal origin, which actually is the characteristic of its family, genus<br>
and more precisely, the species. When these signatures are compared in-silico with the<br>
signatures already available in public databases (viz.. GenBank. NCBI database etc) using<br>
BLAST software73, it indicates identity of the family, genus or species of the analyzed<br>
material, which in turn is confirmed practically by comparing with the reference animals of<br>
the revealed family, genus or species, by including them in the further analysis by the<br>
primers 'mcb398' and 'mcb8G9'. Application Of the information revealed could be in<br>
fulfilling the requirements of objectives mentioned in columns 7-13 under sub-heading<br>
'Objective of invention' of heading 'Summary of invention'<br>
The method of the invention can be used to establish the identity of confiscated animal<br>
parts and products is one of the key requirements of wildlife identification in forensics. It<br>
is needed to establish the crime with the criminal beyond a reasonable doubt to avoid the<br>
human violation of wildlife resources. Various morphological biochemical and molecular<br>
approaches have been given for this purpose; however, none of the current methods is<br>
universally applicable to detect the mutilated animal remains of unknown origin. We have<br>
identified a fragment on the mitochondria! cytochrome b gene, which has enormous<br>
information to differentiate among various animal species back to the family, genus and<br>
species sources. We have also found that this fragment is flanked by the highly conserved<br>
sequences amongst a vast range of animal species. We invented a pair of universal primer<br>
that can amplify this fragment of DNA isolated from the biological material of an<br>
unknown animal origin in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to reveal its identity at species<br>
and sub-species sources. This novel invention has great potential to revolutionize the<br>
whole scenario of wildlife forensic identification and crime investigation.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
We claim:<br>
1.	A universal primer pair for amplifying a fragment of cytochrome b gene of an animal<br>
species in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or determining the identity of the<br>
biological material of an animal of unknown origin at species and sub-species level, said<br>
primer pair having the sequence:<br>
primer name	sequence [5' - 3']<br>
mcb398:	"TACCATGAGGACAAATATCATTCTG"<br>
mcb 869:	"CCTCCTAGTTTGTTAGGGATTGATCG"<br>
wherein the said primers being capable of selectively amplifying a fragment of about<br>
472 base pairs of a mitochondrial cytochrome b gene of any of the 221 animal species,<br>
wherein the fragment being selectively amplified has a sequence that varies among each<br>
of the said 221 animal species.<br>
2.	The primers as claimed in claim 1, wherein the said primers are capable of amplifying a fragment of mitochondrial cytochrome b gene that is flanked by highly conserved sequences amongst a vast range of animal species.<br>
