Novel 4,5-dihvdro-1H-pyrazole derivatives having CBi-antagonistic activity<br>
The present invention relates to a group of novel 4,5-dihydro-IH-pyrazoie derivatives, to methods for the preparation of these compounds, and to pharmaceutical compositions containing one or more of these compounds as an active component.<br>
The above mentioned 4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazoles are potent cannabinoid (CB1) receptor antagonists with utility for the treatment of diseases connected with disorders of the cannabinoid system.<br>
Cannabinoids are present in the Indian hemp Cannabis sativa and have been used as medicinal agents for centuries (Mechoulam, R. and Feigenbaum, J.J. Prog. Med. Chem. 1987, 24, 159). However, only within the past ten years the research in the cannabinoid area has revealed pivotal information on cannabinoid receptors and their (endogenous) agonists and antagonists. The discovery and the subsequent cloning of two different subtypes of Cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) stimulated the search for novel cannabinoid receptor antagonists (Munro, S. et ai, Nature 1993, 365, 61. Matsuda, L.A. and Bonner, T.I. Cannabinoid Receptors, Pertwee, R.G. Ed. 1995, 117, Academic Press, London). In addition, pharmaceutical companies became interested in the development of cannabinoid drugs for the treatment of diseases connected with disorders of the cannabinoid system (Consroe, P. Neurobiology of Disease 1998, 5, 534. Pop, E. Curr. Opin. In CPNS Investigational Drugs 1999, 1, 587. Greenberg, DA Drug News Perspect 1999, 12, 458. Pertwee, R.G., Progress in Neurobiology 2001, 63, 569). Hitherto, several CB-j receptor antagonists are known. Sanofi disclosed their diarylpyrazole congeners as selective CB-, receptor antagonists. A representative example is SR-141716A (Dutta, A.K. et a/., Med. Chem. Res. 1994, 5, 54. Lan, R. et a/., J. Med. Chem. 1999, 42, 769. Nakamura-Palacios, E.M. et ai, CNS Drug Rev. 1999, 5, 43). CP-272871 is a pyrazole derivative, like SR141716A, but less potent and less CB-, receptor subtype-selective than SR141716A (Meschler, J. P. et a/., Pharmacol. 2000, 60, 1315). Aminoalkylindoles have been disclosed as CBi receptor antagonists. A representative example is lodopravadoline (AM-630), which was introduced in 1995. AM-630 is a moderately active CBT receptor antagonist, but sometimes behaves as a weak partial agonist (Hosohata, K. et ai, Life Sc. 1997, 61, PL115). Researchers from Eli Lilly described aryl-aroyl substituted benzofurans as selective CBi receptor antagonists (e.g. LY-320135) (Felder, C.C. et ai, J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998, 284, 291). S-Alkyl-S^'-diphenylimidazoIidinediones were described as cannabinoid receptor ligands, which were indicated to be cannabinoid antagonists (Kanyonyo, M. et ai, Biorg. Med.Chem. Lett. 1999, 9, 2233). Aventis Pharma claimed diarylmethyleneazetidine analogs as CB1 receptor antagonists (Mignani, S, et ai, Patent FR 2783246, 2000; Chem. Abstr. 2000, 132, 236982). Tricyclic pyrazoles were claimed by Sanofi-Synthelabo as CB1 antagonists (Barth, F. et al., Chem. Abstr. 2001,   134,   340504).  Interestingly,   many  CB1   receptor antagonists  have  been<br><br>
reported to behave as inverse agonists in vitro (Landsman, R.S. et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997, 334, R1). Reviews provide a nice overview of the cannabinoid research area (Mechoulam, R. et a/., Prog. Med. Chem. 1998, 35, 199. Lambert, D.M. Curr. Med. Chem, 1999, 6, 635. Mechoulam, R. etaL, Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998, 359, 1. Williamson, E. M. and Evans, F. J. Drugs 2000, 60, 1303. Pertwee, R. G. Addiction Biology 2000, 5, 37. Robson, P. Br. J. Psychiatry 2001, 778, 107. Pertwee, R. G. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001, 63, 569. Goya, P; Jagerovic, N. £xp. Opin. Ther. Patents 2000, 70, 1529. Pertwee, R. G. Gut 2001, 48, 859).<br>
It has now surprisingly been found that potent and selective antagonism of cannabinoid-CB! receptors is present in the novel 4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole derivatives of the formula (I), prodrugs thereof, tautomers thereof and salts thereof<br><br>

At least one centre of chirality is present (at the C4 position of the 4,5-dihydro-1H~ pyrazole moiety) in the compounds of the formula (I). The invention relates both to racemates, mixtures of diastereomers and the individual stereoisomers of the compounds having formula (I). Particular compounds of interest of formula (I) have the absolute stereoconfiguration at the C4 position of the 4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole moiety as represented by formula (ta).<br><br><br>
The invention also relates both to the E isomer, Z isomer and E/Z mixtures of compounds having formula (I).<br>
The compounds of the invention can be brought into forms suitable for administration by means of usual processes using auxiliary substances and/or liquid or solid carrier materials.<br>
Due to the potent CB1 antagonistic activity the compounds according to the invention are suitable for use in the treatment of psychiatric disorders such as psychosis, anxiety, depression, attention deficits, memory disorders, cognitive disorders, appetite disorders, obesity, addiction, appetence, drug dependence and neurological disorders such as neurodegenerative disorders, dementia, dystonia, muscle spasticity, tremor, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, stroke, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, Huntington's disease, Tourette's syndrome, cerebral ischaemia, cerebral apoplexy, craniocerebral trauma, stroke, spinal cord injury, neuroinflammatory disorders, plaque sclerosis, viral encephalitis, demyelinisation related disorders, as well as for the treatment of pain disorders, including neuropathic pain disorders, and other diseases involving cannabinoid neurotransmission, including the treatment of septic shock, glaucoma, cancer, diabetes, emesis, nausea, asthma, respiratory diseases, gastrointestinal disorders, gastric ulcers, diarrhoea and cardiovascular disorders.<br>
The affinity of the compounds of the invention for cannabinoid CB1 receptors was determined using membrane preparations of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells in which the human cannabinoid CB1 receptor is stably transfected in conjunction with [3H]CP-55,940 as radioligand. After incubation of a freshly prepared cell membrane preparation with the [3H]-ligand, with or without addition of compounds of the invention, separation of bound and free ligand was performed by filtration over glassfiber filters. Radioactivity on the filter was measured by liquid scintillation counting.<br>
The cannabinoid CB1 antagonistic activity of compounds of the invention was determined by functional studies using CHO cells in which human cannabinoid CB1  ,<br><br>
receptors are stably expressed. Adenylyl cyclase was stimulated using forskolin and measured by quantifying the amount of accumulated cyclic AMP. Concomitant activation of CB1 receptors by CB1 receptor agonists {e.g. CP-55,940 or (R)-WIN-55,212-2) can attenuate the forskolin-induced accumulation of cAMP in a concentration-dependent manner. This CB1 receptor-mediated response can be antagonised by CB1 receptor antagonists such as the compounds of the invention.<br>
Intermediates having formula (II) (see below) can be obtained according to methods known, for example: a) Francotte, E. and Tong, Z. Chem. Abstr. 126, 213598; b) Rempfier, H. and Kunz, W. Chem. Abstr. 113, 40432; c) Rempfler, H. and Kunz, W. Chem. Abstr 107,217473.<br>
Intermediates having formula (III) (see below), wherein R2 represents hydrogen can be obtained according to methods known, for example: a) EP 0021506; b) DE 2529689; c) Grosscurt, A.C. et a/., J. Agric. Food Chem. 1979, 27, (2), 406.<br>
Intermediates having formula (III) (see below), wherein R2 represents a hydroxy group can be obtained by reacting of a compound having formula (II)<br><br>
with hydrazine or hydrazine hydrate. This reaction is preferably carried out in an organic solvent, for example ethanol, and yields a compound having formula (III)<br><br>
Suitable synthetic routes for the compounds of the invention are the following:<br>
Synthetic route A1<br>
Step 1: reaction of a compound having formula (III) with a thioisocyanate derivative having formula (IV),<br><br><br>
preferably carried out in an organic solvent, for example acetonitrile. This reaction gives a thiocarboxamide derivative having formula (V), wherein R, R1, R2 and R5 have the meanings as described above for compound (!).<br><br>
Step 2: reaction of a compound having formula (V) with a compound R3R4NH in the presence of a mercury(ll) salt, such as for example HgCI2, gives a compound having formula (I). This reaction is preferably carried out in an organic solvent, such as for example acetonitrile.<br>
Synthetic route A2<br><br>
wherein R8 represents a lower alkyl group, for example methyl. This reaction is preferably carried out in an organic solvent, for example 1,4-dioxane, and yields a 4,5-dihydropyrazole-1-carboxamide derivative having formula (VII), wherein R, R1, R2 and R5 have the meanings as described above for compound (I).<br><br><br>
Step 2: reaction, preferably carried out in an inert organic solvent, for example chlorobenzene, of a compound having formula (VII) with a halogenating agent such as PCI5, gives a 4,5-dihydropyrazoIe-1-carboximidoyl halogenide derivative having formula (VI11) wherein R, R1, R2, R5 have the meanings as described above for compound (I) and wherein R9 represents a halogen atom, for example CI.<br><br>
Step 3: reaction of a compound having formula (VIII) with a compound R3R4NH preferably carried out in an inert organic solvent, such as for example dichioromethane gives a compound having formula (I).<br>
Alternatively, compounds R3R4NH which contain an additional nucleophilic-nitrogen atom are reacted with a compound having formula (VIII) in such a way that the abovementioned additional nucleophilic nitrogen atom is protected by a protective group, for example a t-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group and the like. Subsequent removal of the protective group according to known methods yields a compound having formula (I). (See for example: T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts, "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", third edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York, 1999).<br>
Synthetic route A3<br><br>
with a dithioimidocarbonic ester derivative having formula (IX).<br><br><br>
wherein R10 represents a C-,_3 alkyl group. This reaction is preferably carried out in an organic solvent, for example acetonitrile or toluene, and yields a carboximidothioic ester derivative having formula (X), wherein R, R1, R2, R5 have the meanings as described above for compound (I) and wherein R10 represents a c1-3 alkyl group.<br><br>
Alternatively, a compound having formula (X) can be obtained from the reaction of a compound having formula (V) with a compound R10-x, wherein X represents a leaving group such as an iodide group, and R10 has the meaning as described above for (X).<br>
Step 2: Reaction, preferably carried out in an organic solvent, such as methanol, of a compound having formula (X) with a compound R3R4NH gives a compound having<br>
formula (I).<br>
The preparation of the compounds is illustrated in the following examples.<br>

dihydro-1 H-pyrazoIe-1 -carboxamidine<br>
Part A: To a solution of N-((4-chlorophenyl)sulfonyl)carbamic acid methyl ester (CAS: 34543-04-9) (2.99 gram, 12.0 mmol) and pyridine (4 mL) in 1,4-dioxane (20 mL) is added 3-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-phenyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole (3.39 gram, 13.2 mmol) and the resulting mixture is stirred for 4 hours at 100 °C. After concentration in vacuo the residue is dissolved in dichloromethane, successively washed with water, 1N HCI and water, dried over anhydrous Na2S04, filtered and concentrated in vacuo to a volume of 20 mL. Methyl-tert-butyl ether (60 mL) is added and the resulting solution is concentrated to a volume of 20 mL. The formed crystals are collected by filtration and   recrystallised  from   methyl-tert-butyl  ether to   give   3-(4-chIorophenyI)-N-((4-<br><br>
ch[orophenyl)sulfonyl)-4-phenyL-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazoie-1-carboxamide (4.75 gram, 76 % yield) Melting point: 211-214 °C.<br>

After thorough concentration in vacuo, the formed 3-(4-chlorophenyl)-N-((4-ch!oropheny!)sulfonyl)-4-phenyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-1-carboximidoyi chloride is suspended in dry dichloromethane (30 mL) and reacted with 1-aminopiperidine (1.08 mL, 10.0 mmol). After stirring at room temperature for 16 hours, the mixture is twice washed with water and concentrated in vacuo. The residue is crystallised from methyl-t-butyl ether (MTBE) to give pure 3-(4-chlorophenyI)-N'-((4-chlorophenyl)sulfonyl)-N-(piperidin-1-yl)-4-phenyl-4;5-dihydro-1 H-pyrazole-1-carboxamidine (0.57 gram, 34 % yield).

The resulting mixture is heated at reflux temperature for 210 minutes. The resulting mixture is allowed to attain room temperature and concentrated in vacuo. Water and 2N NaOH solution are added, followed by extraction with methyl-t-butyl ether (MTBE). The organic layer is twice washed with water, dried over Na2S04l filtered and concentrated in vacuo. Flash chromatographic purification (eluant: MTBE) gives 2-phenyl-1 -pyridin-3-yI propenone (21.4 gram, 67 % yield) as an oil. ESI-MS (MH+) 210.<br>
Part B: 2-Phenyl-1-pyridin-3-yl propenone (21.4 gram, 0.102 mol) is dissolved in ethanol (150 mL) and hydrazine hydrate is added (10.4 mL). The resulting mixture is heated at reflux temperature for 3 hours. The resulting mixture is allowed to attain room temperature and concentrated in vacuo. Water is added, followed by extraction with dichloromethane. The organic layer is washed with water, dried over Na2S04l filtered and concentrated in vacuo to produce crude 4-phenyl-3-(pyridin-3-yl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazo)e (23 g, -100 % yield). ESI-MS (MH+) 224. Part C: Crude 4-phenyl-3-(pyridin-3-yl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole (9.81 g, 0.044 mol), [(4-chlorophenyl)sulfonyl]dithioimidocarbonic acid dimethyl ester (12.99 gram, 0.044 mol) and triethylamine (47 mL) are successively dissolved in acetonifrile. The resulting mixture is heated at reflux for 70 hours. The resulting mixture is allowed to attain room temperature and concentrated in vacuo. The residue is dissolved in dichloromethane. The organic layer is washed with water, dried over Na2S O4. filtered and concentrated in vacuo. Flash chromatographic purification (eluant: methanol/dichloromethane = 5/95 (v/v)) gives N-((4-chlorophenyl)sulfonyl)-4-phenyl-3-(pyridin--3-yl)-4I5-dihydro--1H-pyrazoIe-1-carboximidothioic acid methyl ester (7.15 gram, 35 % yield). ESI-MS (MH+) 471.<br>
Part D: N-((4-Chlorophenyl)sulfonyl)-4-phenyl-3-(pyridin-3-yl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazoie-1-carboximidothioic acid methyl ester (1.50 gram, 0.0033 mol) is suspended in toluene (25 mL) and 4-methylpiperazine (5 mL) is added. The resulting mixture is heated at 60 °C for 70 hours. The resulting yellow solution is allowed to attain room temperature and concentrated in vacuo. The resulting residue is crystallised from MTBE to give N-[(4-phenyl-3-(pyridin-3-yl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)methylene]-4-fluorobenzene-sulfonamide (1.39 g, 83 % yield). MP: 169-170 °C.<br><br><br>
(0-(4S)-3-(4-Chlorophenyl)-Nt-((4-chiorophenyl)sulfonyf)-N-methoxy-4-phenyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-1-carboxamidine ([α25D] = -165 °, c = 0.01, MeOH) was obtained as an amorphous solid  via chirai chromatographic separation of racemic 3-(4-chlorophenyI)-N'-((4-chlorophenyl)sulfonyl)-N-methoxy-4-phenyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-1-carboxamidine (Chirai stationary phase; Chiralpak AD).
