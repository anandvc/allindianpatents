				<td>ANTIFOULING MATERIAL AND PRODUCTION METHOD THEREOF<br>
The present invention relates to the field of<br>
materials, in particular glazing panels, which are<br>
antisoiling or self cleaning.<br>
Titanium oxide is known for having photocatalytic<br>
properties. In the presence of light, and especially<br>
ultraviolet radiation of UV-A type (of which the<br>
wavelength is between 320 and 400 nm) , titanium oxide<br>
has the particular feature of catalyzing the radical<br>
degradation reactions of organic compounds. It is known<br>
from documents EP-A-850 204 and EP-A-816 466 that<br>
- titanium oxide also has extremely pronounced<br>
hydrophilic properties induced by the same type of<br>
radiation. This hydrophilicity, sometimes referred to<br>
as "super-hydrophilicity" is characterized by a very<br>
small water contact angle, of less than 5°, or even<br>
less than 1°. These two properties, photocatalysis on<br>
the one hand and super-hydrophilicity on the other<br>
hand, give the material containing titanium oxide<br>
particularly advantageous properties. Materials, in<br>
particular of the ceramic, glass or glass-ceramic type,<br>
coated with a thin layer of titanium oxide have, in<br>
effect, antisoiling or self cleaning or else ease-of-<br>
cleaning properties. A glazing panel covered with a<br>
photocatalytic titanium oxide layer degrades the<br>
organic soiling which is deposited thereon under the<br>
action of sunlight. Mineral soiling is itself partly<br>
prevented from being deposited and partly removed owing<br>
to the photoinduced super-hydrophilicity of the<br>
titanium oxide. Mineral soiling, in certain cases, is<br>
in effect caused to be deposited on glazing panels in a<br>
form dissolved in raindrops, and precipitates during<br>
the evaporation of said drops. Owing to the super-<br>
hydrophilicity properties, the water coats and cleans<br>
the glazing instead of being deposited thereon in the<br>
form of drops, which therefore prevents the deposition<br><br>
of mineral soiling by this mechanism of<br>
deposition/evaporation of water drops. As for mineral<br>
soiling such as dust which is deposited without the aid<br>
of rain, for example under the action of wind, it is<br>
quite simply removed by rainwater runoff. The materials<br>
obtained therefore allow the removal of organic and<br>
mineral soiling under the combined effect of solar<br>
radiation and water, in particular rain, runoff.<br>
The materials described previously have, however, a<br>
drawback when they are placed in a site protected from<br>
the rain or in a geographical zone that very rarely<br>
experiences precipitation. Specifically, it has been<br>
observed that, placed in an atmosphere rich in mineral<br>
soiling and sheltered from the rain, glazing panels<br>
covered with photocatalytic titanium oxide and that are<br>
super-hydrophilic are gradually covered with mineral<br>
soiling, in particular in the form of very adherent<br>
dust. After long-term exposure, especially for more<br>
than 2 months, or even 4 months, such glazing has a<br>
surface that is as dirty as that of a glazing panel<br>
devoid of a titanium oxide layer. In the absence of<br>
water runoff, the super-hydrophilic titanium oxide<br>
surface does not therefore prevent the deposition and<br>
adhesion of mineral soiling.<br>
One object of the invention is therefore to overcome<br>
these drawbacks by providing a material that prevents<br>
the deposition of mineral soiling on its surface,<br>
therefore that has little dust accumulation, including<br>
in the absence of water runoff. Another object of the<br>
invention is to provide a material capable of not being<br>
soiled after several months of exposure in sites that<br>
are protected from the rain or geographical zones that<br>
very rarely experience precipitation.<br>
The inventors have discovered that the substrates<br>
covered with a titanium oxide layer, itself surmounted<br><br>
by a thin layer of another hydrophilic material, in<br>
particular of the type comprising silicon and oxygen,<br>
had, completely unexpectedly, the technical effect<br>
consisting in preventing the deposition of mineral<br>
soiling (therefore dust accumulation) on its surface in<br>
the absence of water runoff.<br>
Some of these materials are known and described in<br>
several documents. Application WO 2005/040056<br>
describes, for example, a glazing panel covered with a<br>
titanium oxide layer surmounted by a thin layer of<br>
aluminum-doped silica having a coating capacity and a<br>
thickness of 2 nm. The two layers are deposited by a<br>
sputtering process then annealed together in order to<br>
confer a high photocatalytic activity to the titanium<br>
oxide. The upper silica layer has the effect of<br>
improving the mechanical strength, in particular the<br>
abrasion resistance, of the multilayer. Patent<br>
US 6 379 776 also describes a multilayer on glass<br>
comprising, in particular, a photocatalytic titanium<br>
oxide layer, placed on which is a single layer of SiOx,<br>
x being equal to 1 or 2. The latter layer is described<br>
as having the effect of preventing the deposition of<br>
organic soiling on the surface of the stack, but a<br>
possible effect on the deposition of mineral soiling in<br>
the absence of water runoff is not disclosed. This<br>
patent moreover describes tests carried out outside<br>
that demonstrate an absence of soiling deposition after<br>
six months of exposure, it being specified that the<br>
surface of the samples was subjected to rainwater<br>
runoff. Application EP-A-1 074 525 itself describes a<br>
structure of the same type, having on its outer surface<br>
a thin layer of SiO2 of 10 nm or less, that makes it<br>
possible to improve the hydrophilicity of the material<br>
without too substantially degrading the performance in<br>
terms of photocatalysis. No effect of this overlayer<br>
relative to the deposition of mineral soiling in the<br>
absence of water runoff is described.<br><br>
The technical effect presented by this type of material<br>
and which has very recently been discovered, consisting<br>
in preventing the deposition of mineral soiling on its<br>
surface in the absence of water runoff, has therefore<br>
never been entertained. It is also surprising as it can<br>
in no way be connected to the properties already<br>
described in the prior art. The low adhesion of organic<br>
soiling is, in effect, a property of low chemical<br>
affinity with organic compounds, linked to the<br>
hydrophilic nature of the layer and not correlated to<br>
the adhesion of mineral soiling. However, the<br>
hydrophilic nature alone of a surface does not prevent<br>
the adhesion of mineral soiling in the absence of water<br>
runoff, as the case of titanium oxide demonstrates.<br>
One subject of the invention is therefore the use of a<br>
material composed of a substrate equipped with a<br>
coating based on titanium oxide surmounted by a thin<br>
hydrophilic layer forming at least one part of the<br>
outer surface of said material and that is not composed<br>
of titanium oxide, as a material that prevents the<br>
deposition of mineral soiling on said outer surface in<br>
the absence of water runoff.<br>
The expression "outer surface" should be understood,<br>
within the meaning of the present invention, to be a<br>
surface in contact with the ambient air, the only<br>
surface capable of being soiled.<br>
Without wishing to be tied to any one scientific<br>
theory, it seems that the materials used according to<br>
the invention, owing to their structural<br>
characteristics, do not accumulate dust (or only<br>
accumulate a little dust) owing to a mechanism of<br>
reducing the friction coefficient between the surface<br>
of the material and the mineral soiling, leading to a<br>
much easier removal of this soiling, or even to actual<br><br>
antiadhesive properties. This property of little dust<br>
accumulation is in any case completely independent of<br>
the known properties of photocatalysis and photoinduced<br>
hydrophilicity, as the remainder of the description<br>
will demonstrate.<br>
Thin hydrophilic layer<br>
The thin hydrophilic layer acts in synergy with the<br>
titanium oxide, since none of these layers alone<br>
produces the technical effect discovered.<br>
In order that this synergistic effect occurs<br>
effectively at the surface of the material, the thin<br>
hydrophilic layer must preferably have small<br>
thicknesses, thicknesses of less than 10 nm, or even<br>
5 nm and in particular of 1 to 2 nm being preferred.<br>
This synergistic effect is maximized and the best<br>
performances are obtained when the thin hydrophilic<br>
layers are capable of creating, in the presence of<br>
ambient moisture and owing to the underlying presence<br>
of the titanium oxide, a hydration layer that is not<br>
very dense, in particular that is less dense than<br>
liquid water, this hydration layer being, in addition,<br>
particularly durable, even in the absence of<br>
illumination. This particular hydration layer could<br>
then have the effect of considerably reducing the<br>
friction coefficient between the surface of the thin<br>
hydrophilic layer and the mineral soiling. The latter<br>
would thus slide much more easily over the outer<br>
surface of the material instead of being deposited<br>
thereon and adhering thereto. This preferred<br>
characteristic is not found in the materials described<br>
previously, the materials having this characteristic<br>
are also one subject of the present invention.<br>
The thin hydrophilic layer should not be composed of<br><br>
titanium oxide. It may contain some, advantageously in<br>
an amount less than 20 mol%, or even 10 mol%. According<br>
to one preferred embodiment and in order to obtain very<br>
little dust accumulation, it is however free or almost<br>
free of titanium oxide.<br>
Another characteristic of the thin hydrophilic layers<br>
used according to the invention lies in the high<br>
density of hydroxyl (OH) groups at their surface. It<br>
appears that the higher this density is, the more<br>
pronounced is the technical effect discovered within<br>
this scope of the present invention.<br>
Thus, preferred thin hydrophilic layers are based on<br>
silicon and oxygen and especially comprise silica<br>
(SiO2) , in particular doped with atoms such as aluminum<br>
(Al) or zirconium (Zr), the latter increasing the<br>
density of surface hydroxyl groups. Doping rates<br>
ranging from 3 to 15 at% and preferably from 5 to<br>
10 at% are particularly advantageous.<br>
Other thin hydrophilic layers based on silicon and<br>
oxygen, such as SiOC, SiON or SiOx, with x 
be used according to the invention, but are not<br>
preferred as the number of hydroxyl groups generated at<br>
the surface is lower than in the case of silica (SiO2) .<br>
It is the same for layers comprising silicon and oxygen<br>
such as silicates of alkali or alkaline-earth metal<br>
ions. Thin hydrophilic layers based on alumina (Al2O3)<br>
are also possible.<br>
In order to obtain the lowest possible dust<br>
accumulation, the thin hydrophilic layers, especially<br>
based on optionally doped silica, are preferably not<br>
annealed, that is to say are not subjected to a heat<br>
treatment at more than 500°C, or even 200°C, the effect<br>
of the heat treatment being precisely to decrease the<br>
density of hydroxyl groups at the surface of the layer.<br><br>
In this context, the thin hydrophilic layers are<br>
preferably obtained by a process chosen from<br>
sputtering, the sol-gel process and the plasma-enhanced<br>
chemical vapor deposition process (PECVD, or APPECVD<br>
when it is carried out at atmospheric pressure) , these<br>
processes being carried out at low temperature.<br>
The annealed thin hydrophilic layers also have little<br>
dust accumulation, which seems however to be greater<br>
than in the case of the non-annealed layers. This is<br>
the case, for example, for the layers obtained by<br>
chemical vapor deposition (CVD), this process being<br>
generally carried out on a hot substrate, between 500<br>
and 700°C.<br>
The thin hydrophilic layers may be covering<br>
(continuous) and form in this case the whole of the<br>
outer surface of the material. They may alternatively<br>
not be completely covering, a discontinuous layer, for<br>
example in the form of islands that are separated or<br>
joined together, that make it possible to obtain a<br>
particularly high photocatalytic activity. In this<br>
case, the outer surface of the material comprises the<br>
underlying titanium oxide in the parts not covered by<br>
the hydrophilic layer.<br>
According to certain embodiments, the thin hydrophilic<br>
layer may be an integral part of the coating based on<br>
titanium oxide and constitute the outermost surface<br>
thereof, as explained in the remainder of the text.<br>
Coating based on titanium oxide<br>
The coating based on titanium oxide may be exclusively<br>
composed of titanium oxide (apart from inevitable<br>
impurities). The titanium oxide may be amorphous or<br>
have an at least partially crystalline structure,<br>
especially in anatase or rutile form. The technical<br><br>
effect discovered does not seem a priori to have a<br>
connection with the photocatalytic activity since<br>
amorphous titanium oxide coatings, the photocatalytic<br>
activity of which is extremely low or even nonexistent,<br>
also prevent the deposition and adhesion of mineral<br>
soiling in the absence of water runoff. Other not very<br>
active coatings may therefore also be used, such as<br>
very thin titanium oxide coatings, for example having a<br>
thickness of 1 to 5 run. A layer of crystalline titanium<br>
oxide in anatase form, in particular having a thickness<br>
greater than 5 nm, is however preferred in order to<br>
give the material a sufficient photocatalytic activity<br>
to effectively degrade the organic soiling. Preferred<br>
thicknesses are thus from 5 to 2 0 nm, the larger<br>
thicknesses possibly generating an undesirable coloring<br>
and inducing longer deposition times. The presence of<br>
the thin hydrophilic layer, insofar as its thickness is<br>
not greater than a few nanometers, in particular 5 nm<br>
and especially 2 nm, does not decrease the<br>
photocatalytic activity of the material, and even seems<br>
sometimes to increase it. Examples of particularly<br>
advantageous titanium oxide coatings in the context of<br>
the present invention are, for example, described in<br>
patent application EP-A-850 204 incorporated by<br>
reference in the present application.<br>
The coatings based on titanium oxide may be formed by<br>
various deposition processes, for example by the<br>
process of chemical vapor deposition (CVD, as described<br>
in the aforementioned application EP 850 2 04) , by the<br>
sputtering process (application FR 2 814 094,<br>
incorporated by reference into the present text,<br>
presents one particular method thereof), or by "sol-<br>
gel" type processes.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, the<br>
titanium oxide of the coating based on titanium oxide<br>
is predominantly, or even completely, amorphous. In<br><br>
this case, the material composed of a substrate thus<br>
coated is novel and constitutes one subject of the<br>
present invention. It may, in particular, be a<br>
substrate coated by a layer of titanium oxide then by a<br>
layer of silica, the two layers being obtained<br>
successively by the sputtering process (in particular<br>
assisted by a magnetic field - magnetron sputtering<br>
process) and not undergoing annealing after the<br>
deposition, that is to say no heat treatment at more<br>
than 500°C, in particular 200°C. Another subject of the<br>
invention is therefore a process for obtaining such a<br>
material, comprising successive steps of deposition by<br>
sputtering of a coating based on titanium oxide and of<br>
a thin layer based on silicon and oxygen, but not<br>
comprising an annealing step after the deposition.<br>
Mixed layers<br>
The coating based on titanium oxide may also comprise<br>
titanium oxide mixed with another compound, especially<br>
another oxide. Mixed oxides of titanium and one or more<br>
oxides chosen from silicon, aluminum, magnesium or tin<br>
oxides constitute possible embodiments of the<br>
invention.<br>
The titanium oxide may, in particular, be present in<br>
the form of particles that are discernible and at least<br>
partially crystalline dispersed in a preferably mineral<br>
or inorganic binder. This binder is advantageously<br>
based on silica, for example in the form of an alkali<br>
metal silicate or of silica obtained by the sol-gel<br>
process. The coatings based on titanium oxide described<br>
in applications WO 97/10185 or WO 99/44954 constitute<br>
coatings of this type that can be applied to the<br>
present invention. Coatings based on titanium oxide<br>
particles of nanoscale size dispersed in a binder of<br>
mesoporous type such as described in application<br>
WO 03/87002 are particularly advantageous when a very<br><br>
high photocatalytic activity is required, especially<br>
for applications inside buildings.<br>
In the latter case, where the coating based on titanium<br>
oxide comprises titanium oxide mixed with another<br>
compound, the thin hydrophilic layer, optionally free<br>
of titanium oxide, may be an integral part of the<br>
coating based on titanium oxide and constitute the<br>
outermost surface thereof. A single deposition step is<br>
then sufficient to deposit the coating based on<br>
titanium oxide and the thin hydrophilic layer which<br>
surmounts it. It may be, by way of example, a coating<br>
comprising titanium oxide particles dispersed in a<br>
siliceous binder, the outermost surface (that is to say<br>
a few nanometers) being mainly composed of silica, or<br>
even being only composed of silica and therefore free<br>
of titanium oxide.<br>
Mixed TiO2/SiO2 layer with concentration gradient<br>
A novel material that can be used according to the<br>
invention is a material composed of a substrate<br>
equipped with at least one layer whose surface forms at<br>
least part of the outer surface of said material, said<br>
layer comprising titanium oxide and silicon oxide. This<br>
material is characterized in that the titanium oxide<br>
content at said outer surface is non-zero and in that<br>
the silicon oxide content is higher at said outer<br>
surface than at the center of the layer.<br>
In this embodiment of the invention, the coating based<br>
on titanium oxide and the thin hydrophilic layer form a<br>
single mixed layer (comprising titanium and silicon<br>
oxides), enriched at the surface with silicon oxide.<br>
The thin hydrophilic layer thus is an integral part of<br>
the coating based on titanium oxide and constitutes the<br>
outermost surface thereof.<br><br>
The silicon oxide content at the outer surface of the<br>
layer is greater than the silicon oxide content at the<br>
center of the layer, and even advantageously greater<br>
than the silicon oxide content in the part of the layer<br>
closest to the substrate. The titanium oxide content at<br>
the outer surface is itself preferably less than the<br>
titanium oxide content at the center of the layer, or<br>
even less than the titanium oxide content in the part<br>
of the layer closest to the substrate.<br>
Advantageously, the silicon oxide content increases<br>
continuously in the thickness of the layer from the<br>
center of the layer, especially from the part closest<br>
to the substrate, up to the outer surface. It is then<br>
possible to refer to layers that have a SiO2 content<br>
gradient that increases in the thickness of the layer,<br>
or else mixed layers with a composition gradient. The<br>
term "continuously" should be understood, in the<br>
mathematical sense of the term, to mean that the SiO2<br>
content is a continuous function of the distance to the<br>
substrate. The TiO2 content itself decreases in<br>
correlation with the thickness of the layer, from the<br>
center of the layer to the outer surface, preferably<br>
from the part closest to the substrate to the outer<br>
surface, continuously.<br>
The silicon oxide content at the outer surface is<br>
advantageously greater than or equal to 5 wt%, or even<br>
10 wt% or 15 wt%, and even 20 or 25 wt% and/or less<br>
than or equal to 5 0 wt%, or 4 0 wt%, or even 3 5 wt% or<br>
30 wt%. The silicon oxide content at the center of the<br>
layer is itself preferably less than or equal to<br>
15 wt%, or 10 wt% and even 5 wt%. These layers have a<br>
very marked enrichment of silicon oxide at the surface;<br>
however, contents that do not exceed 50 wt% are<br>
preferred as they make it possible to combine low dust<br>
accumulation with high photocatalytic activity and<br>
super-hydrophilicity, as explained in the remainder of<br><br>
the text. Even higher silicon oxide contents at the<br>
outer surface (more than 5 0%, or more than 7 0% and even<br>
more than 9 0%) make it possible to obtain an even lower<br>
level of dust accumulation, which is accompanied<br>
however by a degradation of the photocatalytic<br>
activity.<br>
The layer according to the invention is preferably<br>
solely composed of titanium oxide and silicon oxide,<br>
apart from inevitable impurities (for example, elements<br>
originating from the substrate).<br>
The thickness of the layer is preferably between 3 and<br>
200 nm, or even between 3 and 100 nm. Thicknesses<br>
between 3 and 30 nm, especially between 5 and 2 0 nm and<br>
even between 5 and 15 nm are preferred. This is<br>
because, for thickness values that are too small, the<br>
desired effect of low dust accumulation is only<br>
slightly obtained. Thicknesses that are too large do<br>
not make it possible to improve this effect and<br>
generate a higher cost, a longer deposition time and an<br>
optical appearance of the layer that is too visible, in<br>
particular undesirable yellow tints. Large thicknesses,<br>
especially greater than or equal to 3 0 nm, or even<br>
50 nm may be appreciated if a high photocatalytic<br>
activity is required, for example for applications as<br>
interior glazing, that receives little ultraviolet<br>
radiation.<br>
The layer comprising titanium oxide and silicon oxide<br>
is advantageously the only layer conferring<br>
photocatalytic or self-cleaning properties on the<br>
material. In particular, the layer according to the<br>
invention is preferably not deposited itself on a<br>
photocatalytic layer based on titanium oxide as such a<br>
multilayer in no way improves the properties of the<br>
material.<br><br>
Mixed TiO2/SiO2 layers have been described in the prior<br>
art, in particular in application WO 97/03029. This<br>
application specifically describes layers having a<br>
refractive index gradient that varies in the thickness<br>
of the layer and that decreases from the zone closest<br>
to the substrate to the zone closest to the surface.<br>
These layers, including mixed TiO2/SiO2 layers, are used<br>
as intermediate layers in multilayers for improving<br>
their optical appearance. They are surmounted by at<br>
least one electrically conductive or low-emissivity<br>
layer and therefore do not form the outer part of the<br>
material.<br>
Process for obtaining mixed TiO2/SiO2 layers having a<br>
composition gradient<br>
The mixed layers having a composition gradient<br>
according to the invention may be obtained by the<br>
process described in WO 97/03029. This chemical vapor<br>
deposition (CVD) process uses a nozzle that extends<br>
transversely to the running axis of the substrate (in<br>
particular of the glass that is in the form of a ribbon<br>
obtained by the float glass process) and that has two<br>
slits for injection of precursor gases of different<br>
compositions and that are sized so that partial and<br>
gradual mixing between the two gas streams is produced<br>
in the deposition zone.<br>
The inventors have however developed a chemical vapor<br>
deposition process that is more astute as it uses a<br>
conventional nozzle, that only has a single gas<br>
injection slit and makes it possible to obtain all<br>
sorts of mixed layers having a composition gradient,<br>
including the TiO2/SiO2 layers described above.<br>
This process for chemical vapor deposition onto a<br>
substrate running along an axis, and using a nozzle<br>
that extends transversely to the running axis of said<br><br>
substrate and that has a single slit, is characterized<br>
in that at least two gaseous precursors that do not<br>
react together are injected simultaneously via said<br>
single slit, said precursors having decomposition<br>
temperatures that are intrinsically or extrinsically<br>
sufficiently different to form a layer in which the<br>
content of the oxide whose precursor has the lowest<br>
decomposition temperature decreases continuously in the<br>
thickness of the layer.<br>
Another subject of the invention is a process for<br>
obtaining a material composed of a substrate equipped<br>
with at least one layer comprising titanium oxide and<br>
silicon oxide, according to which said layer is<br>
deposited by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) onto said<br>
substrate running along an axis, said deposition being<br>
carried out using a nozzle that extends transversely to<br>
the run axis of said substrate and that has a single<br>
slit, gaseous precursors of titanium oxide and of<br>
silicon oxide that do not react together being injected<br>
simultaneously via said single slit, and such that at<br>
least one titanium oxide precursor has a decomposition<br>
temperature that is intrinsically or extrinsically<br>
sufficiently lower than the decomposition temperature<br>
of at least one silicon oxide precursor to form a layer<br>
in which the silicon oxide content increases<br>
continuously in the thickness of the layer.<br>
The inventors have actually realized that by a suitable<br>
choice of the precursors, and more specifically by a<br>
suitable choice of their respective decomposition<br>
temperatures, it was possible to obtain a layer having<br>
a composition gradient using a conventional chemical<br>
vapor phase deposition nozzle. When the decomposition<br>
temperatures are not sufficiently different from one<br>
another, a mixed layer is formed, which has a<br>
substantially homogeneous composition throughout the<br>
thickness of the layer. In the particular case of the<br><br>
TiO2/SiO2 layers according to the invention, too small a<br>
difference between the decomposition temperatures of<br>
the various precursors does not lead to the surface<br>
enrichment in silica that is desired and that is at the<br>
origin of good dust accumulation properties. The<br>
difference needed between the decomposition<br>
temperatures of the precursors obviously depends on a<br>
large number of parameters such as the chemical nature<br>
of the layers to be formed or the temperature of the<br>
substrate during the deposition. It must be adapted on<br>
a case by case basis by a person skilled in the art.<br>
The decomposition temperatures of the precursors may be<br>
intrinsic to the chosen precursor, or be modified<br>
selectively by addition of a compound that inhibits, or<br>
alternatively accelerates, the deposition of the<br>
precursor. It is possible, for example, to add ethylene<br>
(C2H4) to the precursors in order to slow down the<br>
deposition of SiO2, in particular when the SiO2<br>
precursor is tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), which makes it<br>
possible to have a higher composition gradient.<br>
The particular process in which the precursors are<br>
injected together is also preferred as the layers that<br>
it makes it possible to obtain are more effective in<br>
terms of anti-dust properties than the layers obtained<br>
by the process described in application WO 97/03029,<br>
probably due to a different microstructure.<br>
For reasons of ease of use on an industrial scale,<br>
preferably a single titanium oxide precursor and a<br>
single silicon oxide precursor are injected. In order<br>
to obtain a layer having a well defined composition<br>
gradient, the difference between the respective<br>
decomposition temperatures of the titanium oxide and<br>
silicon oxide precursors is preferably at least 50°C,<br>
or 7 5°C, and even 100°C or 150°C.<br><br>
By way of example, the TiO2 and SiO2 precursors may<br>
respectively be tetraiospropyl titanate (TiPT) and<br>
tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), which have the advantages of<br>
being inexpensive and non-toxic. TiPT has a<br>
decomposition temperature of around 300°C, i.e. around<br>
100 to 150°C less than TEOS.<br>
The respective amounts of TiO2 and SiO2 precursors<br>
introduced may be defined by the Ti/ (Ti + Si) molar<br>
ratio calculated from the molar amounts of Ti and Si<br>
atoms introduced (present in the gas phase). This molar<br>
ratio is not found as is in the layer due to the<br>
differences in yield between the precursors.<br>
This ratio is preferably between 0.85 and 0.96,<br>
especially between 0.90 and 0.93. This is because it<br>
has been noted that in this ratio range, the product<br>
obtained made it possible to combine the properties of<br>
low dust accumulation with a photocatalytic activity<br>
and a photoinduced super-hydrophilicity close to those<br>
of a product comprising a single layer of titanium<br>
oxide crystallized in anatase form.<br>
When the Ti/(Ti + Si) ratio is higher, close to 1, the<br>
properties obtained approach those of a substrate<br>
coated by a single titanium oxide layer. The material<br>
obtained therefore has a high dust accumulation, and is<br>
consequently covered with mineral soiling in the<br>
absence of water runoff.<br>
When, on the other hand, the Ti/(Si + Ti) ratio is<br>
lower, in particular around 0.7 or 0.8, or even less,<br>
the surface of the layer is highly enriched with<br>
silicon and the layers obtained have a substantially<br>
reduced, or even nonexistent, photocatalytic activity<br>
and even lose the photoinduced super-hydrophilicity<br>
character. This phenomenon could be due to the fact<br>
that the presence of silica in too high an amount<br><br>
within the mixed layer disturbs the titanium oxide<br>
crystallization properties, giving rise to amorphous<br>
layers or, in any case, layers that are not very<br>
crystalline. Such layers may nevertheless be used<br>
within the meaning of the present invention, as the<br>
dust (mineral soiling) is only slightly deposited and<br>
only slightly adheres to their surface. These layers,<br>
the surface of which is extremely enriched with silica<br>
but still has a high titanium oxide content, are<br>
therefore used all the same due to their ability not to<br>
be covered by mineral soiling.<br>
The layers for which the Ti/(Si + Ti) molar ratio is<br>
optimized make it possible, on the other hand, to<br>
combine all the advantages: low dust accumulation (same<br>
level as for lower molar ratios) , high photocatalytic<br>
activity and photoinduced super-hydrophilicity.<br>
When the substrate is made of glass, and in particular<br>
when it is a sheet of glass formed by pouring molten<br>
glass onto a molten tin bath (process known as the<br>
"float" process), the chemical vapor deposition process<br>
is preferably carried out continuously, at the outlet<br>
of the float bath, on a substrate whose temperature is<br>
usually between 580°C and 630°C.<br>
Another subject of the invention is a material capable<br>
of being obtained by the process according to the<br>
invention described previously. The antisoiling<br>
properties obtained when the surface of the layer<br>
comprising silicon oxide and titanium oxide forms at<br>
least part of the outer surface of the material are, in<br>
effect, particularly attractive. Considering the<br>
difficulty in precisely studying the microstructure of<br>
the layers obtained according to this process, it is<br>
not however possible to structurally define these<br>
preferred materials. The various preferred<br>
characteristics of the material described previously<br><br>
(presence of a sublayer, thicknesses, etc.) also apply<br>
to this material.<br>
The layers of the materials according to the invention<br>
may also be obtained by other deposition processes, for<br>
example a magnetically-enhanced sputtering process<br>
(magnetron sputtering process) in which the substrate<br>
is successively exposed to the bombardment originating<br>
from TiO2 targets increasingly enriched with SiO2.<br>
Types of substrates<br>
The substrates used within the scope of the present<br>
invention may be of mineral nature, especially based on<br>
glass, ceramic or glass-ceramic, or else of organic<br>
nature. In the latter case, various rigid or flexible<br>
plastics may be used such as polymethyl methacrylate<br>
(PMMA), polycarbonate (PC), polypropylene,<br>
polyurethane, polyvinyl butyral, polyethylene glycol<br>
terephthalate, polybutylene glycol terephthalate, and<br>
ionomer resins such as a copolymer of<br>
ethylene/(meth)acrylic acid neutralized by a polyamine,<br>
a cycloolefin copolymer such as ethylene/norbornene or<br>
ethylene/cyclopentadiene copolymers, a polycarbonate/polyester<br>
copolymer, an ethylene/vinyl<br>
acetate copolymer and the like, alone or as blends. Use<br>
may also be made of substrates obtained by<br>
polymerization of diethylene glycol bis(allyl<br>
carbonate) (sold under the trade mark CR39® by PPG<br>
Industries Inc.), or substrates based on a (meth)allyl<br>
or (meth)acrylic polymer, (more particularly those<br>
obtained from monomers or prepolymers derived from<br>
bisphenol A, used alone or as a blend with other<br>
copolymerizable monomers), based on poly(thio)urethane,<br>
or else based on polystyrene or diallyl phthalate<br>
resin.<br>
Sublayers<br><br>
At least one sublayer is preferably inserted between<br>
the substrate and the coating based on titanium oxide.<br>
This sublayer is itself advantageously in contact with<br>
the substrate and/or the coating based on titanium<br>
oxide.<br>
When the substrate contains elements capable of<br>
migrating to the inside of the layer based on titanium<br>
oxide and of disturbing its properties, it is, in<br>
effect, preferable to insert, between said substrate<br>
and said layer based on titanium oxide, a layer that<br>
forms a barrier to the migration of these elements.<br>
This is the case, in particular, when the substrate,<br>
for example when it is a sheet of sodium-lime silicate<br>
glass or a ceramic coated with a glaze, contains alkali<br>
metal ions such as lithium, potassium or sodium.<br>
An alkali metal barrier sublayer is therefore<br>
preferably positioned directly under the coating based<br>
on titanium oxide, which has the role of preventing the<br>
migration of the alkali metal ions possibly contained<br>
in the substrate within the layer comprising titanium<br>
oxide. A barrier layer such as, for example, a layer<br>
comprising SiO2, SiOC, Al2O3 or SnO2 is particularly<br>
suitable for preserving the photocatalytic activity of<br>
the titanium oxide.<br>
The alkali metal barrier sublayer is advantageously a<br>
layer of SiOC (silicon oxycarbide), preferably<br>
deposited by CVD (chemical vapor deposition) directly<br>
onto the substrate. The SiOC sublayer then<br>
advantageously has, on its surface, regularly spaced<br>
bumps that preferably have a width at the base of<br>
around 60 to 120 nm and a height of around 20 to 50 nm.<br>
This is because it has been observed that the technical<br>
effect which consists in preventing the deposition of<br>
mineral soiling on its surface was amplified when the<br><br>
deposition of the coating based on titanium oxide<br>
(especially when it is a mixed TiO2/SiO2 having a<br>
concentration gradient) was carried out on such a<br>
textured surface. The reason for this is, for the time<br>
being, completely unexplained.<br>
It may also be desirable to position at least one<br>
sublayer between the substrate and the coating based on<br>
titanium oxide, for example in order to reduce a<br>
reflection factor or a coloration in reflection that<br>
are judged to be too high. It may be, for example, a<br>
layer or a multilayer whose thicknesses and refractive<br>
indices are such that the assembly formed by these<br>
sublayers and the coating based on titanium oxide forms<br>
an anti-reflection multilayer, in the sense where the<br>
reflection factor obtained is less than that of the<br>
substrate.<br>
Applications<br>
The material according to the invention has the<br>
advantage of preventing the deposition of mineral<br>
soiling (dust accumulation) and therefore of not being<br>
soiled in the absence of water runoff, in particular<br>
during exposure that is outside but is sheltered from<br>
the rain, therefore when it is subjected to a cycle<br>
characterized by the alternation of solar illumination<br>
during the day and the absence of illumination during<br>
the night. It is during a cycle of several<br>
alternations, especially after several months of<br>
exposure (2, or 4 months, or more), that the advantage,<br>
relative to a substrate equipped with a photocatalytic<br>
coating that is uncoated or is based on TiO2 alone, is<br>
revealed. Such situations are frequent, in particular<br>
in the case of buildings that have cornices, overhangs<br>
or sunshades in front of or above glazed walls, the<br>
latter therefore not being subjected to rainwater<br>
runoff. Use of the material in outside zones protected<br><br>
from the rain or in geographical zones that very rarely<br>
experience precipitation is therefore particularly<br>
advantageous.<br>
Another subject of the invention is the use of a<br>
material according to the invention as a material that<br>
has the property of not being soiled when it is placed<br>
in outside exposure in zones that are protected from<br>
the rain or in geographical zones that very rarely<br>
experience precipitation.<br>
The very recently discovered technical effect also<br>
enables use of the material inside a building, for<br>
example in the form of interior glazing or a display<br>
screen such as a screen of the LCD (Liquid Crystal<br>
Display), plasma or cathode-ray tube type, to prevent<br>
dust accumulation on the screen. It is also possible to<br>
use the material according to the invention inside a<br>
transport vehicle (motor vehicle, train, plane, etc.)<br>
for example, as a windshield or side window of a motor<br>
vehicle. It should furthermore be noted that the<br>
properties of the material according to the invention<br>
are not affected by toughening or bending.<br>
The invention will be better understood with the aid of<br>
the following exemplary embodiments, which illustrate<br>
the invention without however limiting it.<br>
Example 1<br>
A glazing panel, sold by Saint-Gobain Glass under the<br>
name SGG Bioclean® and composed of a soda-lime silicate<br>
glass substrate equipped on one of its surfaces with a<br>
thin layer of SiOC acting as a barrier to the migration<br>
of alkali metals covered by a titanium oxide coating<br>
with a thickness of 15 nm, crystallized in anatase form<br>
and obtained by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD)<br>
process, served as comparative example Cl. This glazing<br><br>
panel was of the self cleaning type in the presence of<br>
solar radiation and rainwater runoff due to the<br>
photocatalytic and super-hydrophilic properties of the<br>
titanium oxide, which enabled it to degrade the organic<br>
soiling and to remove the mineral soiling under water,<br>
especially rain, runoff.<br>
A second comparative example (C2) was constituted by a<br>
glazing panel made of uncoated soda-lime silicate<br>
glass.<br>
In order to produce example 1 according to the<br>
invention, the glazing panel from comparative<br>
example Cl was in turn coated with a very thin layer of<br>
silica doped with aluminum in an amount of 8 at%,<br>
deposited by the magnetically-enhanced sputtering<br>
process, sometimes referred to as "magnetron<br>
sputtering" process. The thickness of this unannealed<br>
thin hydrophilic layer was around 2 nm.<br>
These three glazing panels were exposed to outside<br>
conditions for 4 months under a transparent canopy,<br>
consequently sheltered from the rain but not from solar<br>
radiation. They were subjected to a cycle characterized<br>
by the alternation of solar illumination during the day<br>
and the absence of illumination during the night.<br>
After exposure, the three glazing panels were observed.<br>
The two comparative samples Cl and C2 both had a very<br>
large quantity of extremely adherent mineral dust on<br>
the exposed surface. The glazing panel according to the<br>
invention itself had no notable dust accumulation.<br>
Example 2<br>
Deposited onto a soda-lime silicate glass substrate<br>
were an alkali metal barrier sublayer made of SiOC with<br>
a thickness of 50 nm via a chemical vapor deposition<br><br>
process starting from SiH4, ethylene and optionally an<br>
oxidizing compound, according to the process described<br>
in application EP 0 518 755. This sublayer was<br>
naturally textured, and had, at its surface, bumps<br>
whose width at the base was around 100 nm and the<br>
height around 3 0 nm.<br>
Deposited onto this sublayer were mixed layers of TiO2<br>
and SiO2 via a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process<br>
using a standard spray nozzle (equipped with a single<br>
slit). Injected through this single slit were the<br>
precursors of TiO2 (tetraisopropyl titanate TiPT) and<br>
of SiO2 (tetraethoxysilane, TEOS) , the Ti/(Ti + Si)<br>
molar ratio in the gas phase varying as a function of<br>
the tests between 0.67 and 1. The value of 1<br>
corresponded to the comparative test in which TEOS was<br>
not injected. The layers obtained had a thickness of<br>
around 9 to 12 nm depending on the tests.<br>
Considering their small thickness and their particular<br>
texturization (due to the presence of the SiOC<br>
sublayer), it was difficult to elucidate, with<br>
precision, the structure of these layers. The Si/Ti<br>
molar ratio at the surface of the layer (the first<br>
nanometers) was measured by the method known as ESCA<br>
(Electron Spectroscopy for Chemical Analysis) also<br>
known as XPS (X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy). The<br>
local composition of the layers as a function of the<br>
thickness was studied by SIMS (Secondary Ion Mass<br>
Spectroscopy).<br>
The following elements emerged from the latter study:<br>
the layer for which the Ti/(Ti + Si) ratio was<br>
equal to 0.92, therefore weakly enriched with silicon,<br>
had a very low content of silicon oxide (at most a few<br>
percent by weight) at the center of the layer, this<br>
content greatly and continuously increasing on<br><br>
approaching the outer surface of the material, to reach<br>
around 2 5 to 3 0% by weight; and<br>
the layer for which the Ti/(Ti + Si) ratio was<br>
equal to 0.67 had a silicon oxide content of around 5<br>
to 10% by weight at the center of the layer, this<br>
content greatly and continuously increasing on<br>
approaching the outer surface of the material, to reach<br>
around 7 0 to 75% by weight. The outermost surface of<br>
the layer therefore predominantly contained silica. The<br>
weight content of titanium oxide therefore decreased<br>
continuously in the thickness of the layer from the<br>
center (90-95%) to the surface (25-30%).<br>
The photocatalytic, photoinduced hydrophilicity and<br>
dust accumulation properties were measured as described<br>
below.<br>
The photocatalytic activity was determined by measuring<br>
the color variation, after exposure to ultraviolet<br>
radiation, of an ink layer deposited on the outer<br>
surface of the material. This ink, described in<br>
application EP 1 601 462, was composed of a colored<br>
indicator such as methylene blue, a sacrificial<br>
electron donor organic molecule and a neutral polymer<br>
matrix, and had the particularity of detecting redox<br>
reactions at the surface of the titanium oxide and of<br>
changing color as a function of the intensity of these<br>
reactions. The irradiation of the titanium oxide in<br>
effect generated an electron-hole pair, the electron<br>
having made the colored indicator react via a reduction<br>
reaction and the hole having recombined with an<br>
electron originating from the electron donor organic<br>
molecule. A few drops of ink were deposited on the<br>
surface of the material then a sheet of glass that was<br>
transparent to ultraviolet radiation was sealed over<br>
said surface so that the ink covered the entire surface<br>
homogeneously. During irradiation of the surface via<br><br>
ultraviolet radiation, the color variation of the ink<br>
was quantified by spectrophotometry in terms of<br>
variation of the component a* in the La*b* color-<br>
measuring system. The results were expressed in<br>
arbitrary units taking the comparative example in which<br>
the silica precursor was not injected as the base<br>
(value fixed arbitrarily at 100).<br>
The dust accumulation, or the ability of the material<br>
to be covered with mineral soiling adhering to its<br>
surface, was measured as follows. The samples were<br>
irradiated for 10 hours by ultraviolet radiation (UV-A<br>
type, power 30 W/m2) to activate their surface (make it<br>
hydrophilic). In an environmental chamber in the<br>
absence of UV illumination, the surface of the samples<br>
was then covered with calcium carbonate particles of<br>
less than 50 microns in diameter that simulated dust.<br>
After 15 minutes, the material was placed in a vertical<br>
position to remove the excess dust and the surface was<br>
then cleaned using a compressed air jet, so that only<br>
the dust adhering remained on the surface of the<br>
material. This procedure was repeated cumulatively up<br>
to six repeats at a rate of one test per hour then the<br>
percentage of the surface still occupied by dust was<br>
measured by image analysis techniques. The comparative<br>
sample (corresponding to a Ti/(Ti + Si) ratio of 1)<br>
being taken as the reference (base 100), the results<br>
were expressed as a percentage of the surface still<br>
occupied by adherent dust relative to this reference.<br>
The photoinduced hydrophilicity properties were<br>
determined by measurements of the water contact angle.<br>
Two types of measurement were carried out: measurements<br>
taken after illumination by ultraviolet radiation then<br>
storage for 1 to 7 days in darkness, and measurements<br>
taken after an exposure time to ultraviolet rays<br>
ranging from 15 minutes to 26 hours.<br><br>
Table 1 below collates the results of the<br>
photocatalytic activity and dust accumulation of the<br>
various examples. Tables 2 and 3 for their part collate<br>
the hydrophilicity results.<br><br><br><br>
These results show that an enrichment of the silica<br>
layer considerably improves the dust accumulation<br>
properties, in the sense where two or three times less<br>
dust adheres to the surface of the material compared to<br>
the case where the layer only comprises titanium oxide.<br>
This effect is still obtained for small amounts of<br>
silicon precursors introduced (Ti/(Ti + Si) ratio of<br>
0.92, i.e. only 8 mol% of silicon), therefore for low<br>
silicon contents in the mixed layer; the subsequent<br>
increase in the silicon content only has a small effect<br>
on this property. On the other hand, the presence of<br>
silicon in the layer rapidly degrades its<br>
photocatalytic activity, until practically canceling it<br>
out. The effects of low dust accumulation and<br>
photocatalytic activity are therefore completely<br>
decorrelated. It can also be noted that the addition of<br>
a silicon precursor very significantly increases the<br>
Si/Ti ratio at the surface of the material, this ratio<br>
being equal to around 2 when the silicon precursor is<br>
only added in an amount equal to half the titanium<br>
precursor content.<br>
In terms of hydrophilicity, table 2 shows that the<br>
sample for which the Ti/(Ti + Si) ratio is 0.92 has a<br>
photoinduced hydrophilic character that decreases when<br>
the material is subjected to a long period of darkness,<br>
to an extent comparable to the performance of the<br>
comparative sample that is free of silicon. The<br>
hydrophilicity may then be again rapidly obtained by<br>
subjecting the sample to ultraviolet radiation<br>
(table 3) . On the other hand, the addition of higher<br>
silicon contents in the layer very substantially<br>
degrades the photoinduced hydrophilicity properties<br>
since the samples for which the Ti/(Ti + Si) ratio is<br>
0.85 or less are hydrophobic and remain so even after a<br><br>
new illumination under ultraviolet radiation (see table<br>
3). These results therefore again demonstrate that the<br>
low dust accumulation of the materials according to the<br>
invention is completely independent of the photoinduced<br>
hydrophilicity properties.<br>
The materials according to the invention therefore have<br>
the property of preventing or at least slowing down the<br>
deposition of mineral soiling on their surface. When<br>
low silicon contents are used, this property is<br>
moreover coupled with the known properties of the<br>
titanium oxide which are the photocatalysis and the<br>
photoinduced hydrophilicity. Such materials are<br>
therefore particularly desirable due to their property<br>
of not being soiled when they are placed in outside<br>
exposure in zones protected from the rain or in<br>
geographical zones that very rarely experience<br>
precipitation.<br>
All the glazing panels from example 2 were exposed for<br>
4 months in outside conditions similar to those<br>
described for example 1.<br>
After exposure, the glazing panels according to the<br>
invention did not have any notable dust accumulation.<br>
On the other hand, the comparative glazing panel<br>
(corresponding to the Ti/(Ti + Si) ratio of 1) was dirty<br>
and had a large amount of extremely adherent mineral<br>
dust on its surface.<br>
The preceding description makes it possible to<br>
illustrate some possible embodiments of the invention.<br>
It is clearly understood that this description is not<br>
however limiting and that a person skilled in the art<br>
is able to achieve other variants of the invention<br>
without however going outside the scope thereof.<br><br>

material that has property of not being soiled when it<br>
is placed in outside exposure in zones that are<br>
protected from the rain or in geographical zones that<br>
very rarely experience precipitation.<br>
12.	A material composed of a substrate equipped with<br>
a coating based on titanium oxide surmounted by a thin<br>
hydrophilic layer forming at least one part<br><br>
of the outer surface of said material and that is<br>
not composed of titanium oxide, characterized in<br>
that said thin hydrophilic layer is capable of<br>
creating, in the presence of ambient moisture and<br>
owing to the underlying presence of the titanium<br>
oxide, a hydration layer that is less dense than<br>
liquid water.<br>
13.	The material composed of a substrate equipped with<br>
a coating based on titanium oxide surmounted by a<br>
thin hydrophilic layer forming at least one part<br>
of the outer surface of said material and that is<br>
not composed of titanium oxide, characterized in<br>
that the titanium oxide is predominantly<br>
amorphous.<br>
14.	A material composed of a substrate equipped with<br>
at least one layer whose surface forms at least<br>
one part of the outer surface of said material,<br>
said layer comprising titanium oxide and silicon<br>
oxide, characterized in that the titanium oxide<br>
content at said outer surface is non-zero and in<br>
that the silicon oxide content is higher at said<br>
outer surface than at the center of the layer.<br>
15.	The material as claimed in the preceding claim,<br>
such that the silicon oxide content increases<br>
continuously in the thickness of the layer from<br>
the center of the layer, especially from the part<br>
closest to the substrate, up to the outer surface.<br>
16.	The material as claimed in claim 14 or 15, such<br>
that the thickness of the layer is between 3 and<br>
30 nm, preferably between 5 and 20 nm.<br>
17.	The material as claimed in one of claims 14 to 16,<br>
such that the silicon oxide content in the part of<br>
the layer closest to the substrate is non-zero.<br><br>
18.	The material as claimed in one of claims 14 to 17,<br>
such that an alkali metal barrier sublayer is<br>
. positioned directly under the layer comprising<br>
titanium oxide and silicon oxide.<br>
19.	The material as claimed in the preceding claim,<br>
such that the alkali metal barrier sublayer is a<br>
SiOC layer, preferably deposited by CVD directly<br>
onto the substrate.<br>
20.	The material as claimed in the preceding claim,<br>
such that the SiOC sublayer has, on its surface,<br>
regularly spaced bumps that preferably have a<br>
width at the base of around 60 to 12 0 nm and a<br>
height of around 2 0 to 50 nm.<br>
21.	A process for obtaining a material composed of a<br>
substrate equipped with at least one layer<br>
comprising titanium oxide and silicon oxide,<br>
according to which said layer is deposited by<br>
chemical vapor deposition (CVD) onto said<br>
substrate running along an axis, said deposition<br>
being carried out using a nozzle that extends<br>
transversely to the run axis of said substrate and<br>
that has a single slit, gaseous precursors of<br>
titanium oxide and of silicon oxide that do not<br>
react together being injected simultaneously via<br>
said single slit, and such that at least one<br>
titanium oxide precursor has a decomposition<br>
temperature that is intrinsically or extrinsically<br>
sufficiently lower than the decomposition<br>
temperature of at least one silicon oxide<br>
precursor to form a layer in which the silicon<br>
oxide content increases continuously in the<br>
thickness of the layer.<br>
22.	The process as claimed in the preceding claim,<br><br>
such that a single titanium oxide precursor and a<br>
single silicon oxide precursor are injected.<br>
23 . The process as claimed in the preceding claim,<br>
such that the difference between the respective<br>
decomposition temperatures of the titanium oxide<br>
and silicon oxide precursors is at least 50°C.<br>
24.	The process as claimed in the preceding claim,<br>
such that the silicon oxide and titanium oxide<br>
precursors are respectively tetraethoxysilane<br>
(TEOS) and tetraisopropyl titanate (TiPT).<br>
25.	The process as claimed in one of the preceding<br>
process claims, such that the Ti/(Ti + Si) molar<br>
ratio calculated from the molar amounts of Ti and<br>
Si atoms introduced (present in the gas phase) is<br>
between 0.85 and 0.96, preferably between 0.90 and<br>
0.93.<br>
26.	A material capable of being obtained according to<br>
the process of one of the preceding process<br>
claims.<br>
27.	A material as claimed in one of the preceding<br>
material claims, such that the substrate is made<br>
of glass.<br>
28.	A glazing panel or display screen incorporating at<br>
least one material as claimed in the preceding<br>
claim.<br><br>
The invention relates to a material comprising a substrate which is provided<br>
with a titanium oxide-based coating which is topped with a thin hydrophilic<br>
layer. The aforementioned thin hydrophilic layer forms at least part of the<br>
external surface of the material and does not comprise titanium oxide. The<br>
invention relates to the use of said material in order to prevent mineral<br>
fouling from being deposited on the external surface in the absence of water<br>
runoff.</td>
