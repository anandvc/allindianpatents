PRESTRESSED COMPOSITE GIRDER. CONTINUOUS PRESTRESSWED<br>
COMPOSITE GIRDER STRUCTURE AND METHODS OF FABRICATING<br>
AND CONNECTING THE SAME<br>
Technical Field<br>
5                     The present invention relates to a prestressed composite girder<br>
with steel plates, a continuous preatressed composite girder structure with<br>
steel plates and methods of fabricating and connecting the same.<br>
Background Art<br>
For prior art, there are a prestressed composite girder formed of<br>
10         concrete without steel plates,  and a continuous  prestressed  composite<br>
girder structure formed by simply using bolls.<br>
FIGS.  1A and 1B are front and side section at views showing a<br>
conventional prestressed composite girder 10 that is widely used,<br>
F!G. 1A is a front sectional view of the conventional prestressed<br>
15         composite  girder  10.     Referring  to  FIG,  1A,   a  concrete  structure   10<br>
includes shear reinforcing bars and main reinforcing bars 20, horizontel<br>
shear   reinforcing   bars   30   combining   an   upper  floor   stab   with   the<br>
conventional prestressed composite girder, and sheaths 40 including steel<br>
wires to introduce a compressive force to the lower end of the tensile side<br>
2 0         of the concrete structure 10.<br>
FIG. 1B is a side sectional view of the conventional prestressed<br>
composite girder.  Referring to FIG, 1B, the sheaths 40 including steel<br>
wires are arranged across the conventional prestressed composite girder in<br>
a parabolic form, and sole plates 50 are embedded in the lower portions of<br>
25 the ends of the conventional prestressed composite girder to connect with<br>
bridge seats.<br>
The  conventional  prestressed  composite  girder constructed  as<br><br>
WO 2004/059089                                                                                                   PCT/KR2003/002826<br>
described above is a composite girder that is configured to cope with both<br>
dead and live loads applied later by introducing a eompressive force to the<br>
entire conventional prestressed composite girder using the steel wires<br>
included in the sheaths embedded in the conventional prestressed<br>
5          composite girder where the reinforcing bars are arranged.    However, the<br>
conventional prestressed composite girder is formed of only concrete, so<br>
that the rigidity thereof is low compared to a steel structure formed of a<br>
steel and. thus, the clearance thereof must be greater. Accordingly, the<br>
conventional prestressed composite girder is disadvantageous in that the<br>
10  appearance thereof looks crude and it can not be applied to the a bridge<br>
across river, which requires a sufficient overhead clearance. Furthermore,<br>
the horizontal reinforcing bars functioning to combine an upper floor slab<br>
with the conventional prestressed composite girder must be removed from<br>
a completed structure,  so that the conventional prestressed  composite<br>
15  girder is uneconomical in that reinforcing bars more that those required for<br>
the conventional prestressed composite girder itself are arranged in the<br>
convetional prestressed composite girder.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a<br>
20         prestressed composite girder, a continuous prestressed composite girder<br>
structure and methods of fabricating and connecting the same, in which<br>
steel   plates   are   embedded   in   the   upper   and   lower   flanges   of   the<br>
prestressed composite girder, so that the rigidity thereof is increased, thus<br>
reducing   the  clearance  thereof and,  thus,  achieving   a   compact   and<br>
2 5         economical construction.<br>
Additional objects and/or advantages of the invention will be set<br>
forth in pert in the description which follows and, in part, will be obvious<br>
from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention.<br>
The above  and/or other objects are  achieved  by providing   a<br><br>

FIGS.  2A  and 2B  are views  showing  the  cross-sections  of a<br>
composite girder with steel plates according to the present Invention,    In<br>
the prestressed composite girder of the present invention, a  concrete<br>
10         structure  10,  shear reinforcing bars and main  reinforcing bars 20 and<br>
sheaths 40 including steel wires are constructed in the same manner as in<br>
the prior art, and steel plates 60 provided with shear connecting members<br>
70 are additionally included in the prestrassed composite girder.    In this<br>
case, the steel plates 60 increase the rigidity of the prestressed composite<br>
15         girder and the shear connecting members 70 function to combine the steet<br>
plates 60 with the composite girders and the floor slab.    In this case, the<br>
steel  plate 60 embedded  in the lower flange of the concrete  may  be<br>
embedded in the tower surface of the lower flange, as shown in FIG. 2A. or<br>
may be embedded inside of the lower flange to protect the steel plate 60<br>
20        from moisture, as shown in FIG. 2B.    Accordingly, the rigidity of the<br>
prestressed   composite   girder   is   greatly   increased   compared   to   a<br>
conventional prestressed composite girder, so that the clearance of the<br>
cross-section thereof can be reduced.    Furthermore, the shear connecting<br>
members 70 functioning to combine with the floor slab with the prestressed<br>
25         composite girder are previously welded to the steel plates, so that it is not<br>
necessary to arrange reinforcing bars in the prestressed composite gjrder,<br>
thus eliminating the waste of excessive reinforcing bars<br>
FIG, 3A is a diagram showing moments attributable to a self-weight<br>
when the prestressed composite girder of the present invention is used in a<br>
30        simple bridge.    FIGS. 3B and 3C are side sectional views showing the<br>
arrangement of steel plates 60 in the prestressed composite girder when<br><br>

the prestressed composite girder is applied to a simple bridge. The steel<br>
plates 60 may be embedded across an entire length of the prestrassed<br>
composite girder except ranges extending from both ends of the<br>
prestressed composite girder by about 15% of a span.L. which is scarcely<br>
5 influenced by a tensile force, as shown In FIG. 3B, or may be embedded in<br>
the upper and lower flanges of the prestressed composite girder across an<br>
entire span of the prestressed composite girder, as shown in FIG. 3C.<br>

4C and 4D are side sectional views showing the arrangement of steel<br>
plates in the continuous prestressed composite girder structure when the<br>
continuous prestressed composite girder structure is applied to an outside<br>
span of a continuous bridge.    FIG. 4B shows the case where the steel<br>
15         plates 60 are embedded in the upper and lower flanges of the continuous<br>
prestressed composite girder structure in a negative moment range.    FIG.<br>
4D shows the case where steel plates 60 are embedded in a negative<br>
moment range, as shown in FIG. 4B. and steel plates 60 are embedded in<br>
a range from a point spaced apart from a 3L/8 point to a right thereof by<br>
20         about 0.2L to a point spaced apart from a 3L/8 point to a left thereof by<br>
about  0-2L.     By  embedding the  steel  plates 60  in the  ranges where<br>
positive and negative moments are greatest, the rigidity of the continuous<br>
prestressed composite girder structure is increased, so that the clearance<br>
of the continuous prestressed composite girder structure can be reduced.<br>
25         Meanwhile, as occasion demands, steel plates 60 may be embedded in the<br>
upper and lower flanges of the continuous prestressed composite girder<br>
structure across the entire length of the prestressed composite girder<br>
structure.    In these cases, the positions of the steel plates 60 may be<br>
classified into two cases, as shown in FIGS. 2 A and 2B.<br>

manner (see reference numeral 110) and a connecting ptate 600 is welded<br>
to the steel plates 200 at the four sides thereof as in the lower flanges af<br>
the prestressed composite girders. The pressessed composite girders<br>
are completely connected to each other by filling a gap 100 between the<br>
5 prestressed composite girders with an epoxy resin, thus finishing a<br>
continuous prestressed composite girder.<br>
FIG. 7 is views showing a method of connecting preflex composite<br>
girders In a welding manner using a web connecting steel plate 400.    The<br>
upper and lower flanges 1100 and 900 of the steel forms of the preflex<br>
10         composite girders are connected to each other in a butt welding manner<br>
(see reference numeral  110) in the state where two preflex composite<br>
girders are brought into contact with each other over a bridge seat 90.    An<br>
upper connecting steel plate 600 is placed on the upper flanges 1100 and<br>
is welded to the upper flange steels 1100 at the four sides thereof.    A<br>
15         lower connecting steel plate 800 is placed under the lower flange steel 900<br>
and is welded to the lower flange steel 900 at the four sides thereof.    The<br>
webs of the steel forms of the preflex composite girders are connected to<br>
each other using the web connecting steel plate 400 at the four sides<br>
thereof, thus completing the connection of the preflex composite girders.<br>
20                                                       industrial Applicability<br>
As apparent from the above description,  the  present invention<br>
provides a prestressed composite girder and a continuous prestressed<br>
composite girder structure, which is capable of increasing the  rigidity<br>
thereof, thus reducing the clearance thereof and achieving the compact<br>
2 5         cross-section thereof.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention provides methods of fabricating<br>
