				<td>SUSTAINED-RELEASE TRAMADOL FORMULATIONS WITH 24-HOUR EFFICACY<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]This invention relates to a novel once daily oral pharmaceutical composition for controlled release of tramadol or a salt thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Tramadol Pharmaceutical Formulations<br>
[0002]Tramadol hydrochloride (HCI) was developed by Grunenthal GmbH, Germany. It has been marketed in Germany since 1977 (eg. Tramal™), and in the United States as Ultram® since 1995. The efficacy and safety profile of tramadol HCI make it highly suitable as a long-term treatment for chronic pain.<br>
[0003] Tramadol HCI is a synthetic, centrally acting analgesic that has been shown to be effective in a variety of acute and chronic pain states. In particular, tramadol HCI, in both immediate and slow-release formulations, in conjunction with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAlDs) (Roth SH. "Efficacy and safety of tramadol HCI in breakthrough musculoskeletal pain attributed to osteoarthritis". J. Rheumatol 1998; 25:1358-1363. Wilder-Smith CH et al. Treatment of severe pain from osteoarthritis with slow-release tramadol or dihydrocodeine in combination with NSAID's: a randomized study comparing analgesia, antinociception and gastrointestinal effects". Pain 2001; 91:23-31.), has been demonstrated to reduce pain attributed to osteoarthritis (OA). After oral administration, tramadol HCI is rapidly and almost completely absorbed, and it is extensively metabolized. The major metabolic pathways appear to be N- and O- demethylation and glucuronidation or sulfonation in the liver. Only one metabolite, mono-O-desmethyltramadol (M1), is pharmacologically active, which has an approximate 200-fold higher affinity for the //-opioid receptor than racemic tramadol (DeJong R. "Comment on the hypoalgesic effect of tramadol in relation to CYP2D6" (comment) Pain Dig 1997; 7:245; Kogei B. et al "Involvement of metabolites in the analgesic action of tramadol" Proc. 9th World Congress on Pain, Vienna, 1999). In healthy humans, tramadol is demethylated by the polymorphic enzyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) to the M1 metabolite.<br><br>
[0004] The mechanism of action of tramadol HCI is not completely understood. Animal models indicate that the drug (and its active M1 metabolite) acts as an opiate agonist, apparently by selective activity at the //-receptor. In addition to. opiate agonist activity, tramadol HCI inhibits re-uptake of certain monoamines (norepinephrine, serotonin) which appears to contribute to the drug's analgesic effect. The antinociceptic effect of tramadol HCI is only partially antagonized by naloxone in some tests in animals and humans. In addition, because of the drug's opiate agonist activity, it has been suggested that tramadol HCI may produce dependence; however, its abuse potential appears to be low, and tramadol HCI is not "subject to control" under the United States Federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970 as a scheduled drug.<br>
[0005] Immediate release formulations of tramadol HCI are well known in the art. Such formulations, however, require frequent dosing in order to provide effective pain relief. Lack of compliance with high frequency dosing regimens can result in inconsistent plasma drug concentrations and accordingly less consistent analgesia. Twice daily formulations are available and are desirable over immediate release formulations as they provide longer periods of analgesia after administration and require less frequent dosing. A once daily formulation is even more desirable for increased effectiveness, safety and convenience.<br>
[0006]A critical factor influencing the rate of absorption, and thereby the safety and efficacy, of an active pharmaceutical ingredient by the body following oral administration in a tablet or other solid dosage form is the rate of release of the active pharmaceutical ingredient from that dosage form post ingestion.<br>
[0007] It is thus the ability of the dosage form components to control the release rate that constitutes the basis for the so-called controlled-release, extended-release, sustained-release or prolonged-action pharmaceutical preparations that are designed to produce slow, uniform release and absorption of active pharmaceutical ingredients over a period of hours, days, weeks or months. The advantages of such controlled-release formulations include: a reduction in the required administration frequency of the drug as compared to conventional immediate release dosage forms, often resulting in improved patient compliance; the maintenance of a stable concentration of the drug in the body and thereby a sustained therapeutic effect over a set period of time; and a decreased incidence and intensity of undesired side effects of the active<br><br>
agent caused by the high plasma concentrations that occur after administration of immediate-release dosage forms.<br>
[0008] Many materials have been proposed and developed as matrices for the controlled release of active pharmaceutical ingredients. These include, for example, polymeric materials such as polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene amides, ethyl cellulose, silicone and poly (hydroxymethyl methacrylate). See e.g., U.S. Patent No. 3,087,860 to Endicott et a/.; U.S. Patent No. 2,987,445 to Levesque et a/.; Salomon et a/. Pharm. Acta Helv., 55, 174-182 (1980); Korsmeyer, Diffusion Controlled Systems: Hydrogels, Chap. 2, pp 15-37 in Polymers for Controlled Drug Delivery, Ed Tarcha, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla. USA (1991); and Buri et al.} Pharm. Acta Helv. 55, 189-197(1980).<br>
[0009] High amylose starch has also been used for controlled-release purposes and, in particular, recent advances have been made using cross-linked high amylose starch. For example, United States Patent No. 6,284,273 (Lenaerts et a/.), which issued September 4, 2001, and No. 6,419,957 (Lenaerts et a/.), which issued July 16, 2002, teach a solid controlled release oral pharmaceutical dosage unit in the form of tablets comprising a dry powder of a pharmaceutical product and a dry powder of cross-linked high amylose starch, wherein said cross-linked high amylose starch is a matrix comprising a mixture of about 10-60% by weight of amylopectin and about 40-90% amylose. United States Patent No. 6,607,748 (Lenaerts et a/.) which issued on August 19, 2003 describes a process for making a cross-linked high amylose starch which is known under the name Contramid®.<br>
Extended Release Formulations Known in the Art<br>
[0010] Extended and controlled release formulations relating to tramadol HCI have been suggested, examples being described in: United States Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0143270, (Deboeck et a/.) published July 31, 2003; United States Patent No. 6,254,887 (Miller et a/.) issued July 3, 2001; United States Patent Application Publication No. 2001/0036477 (Miller etal.) published November 1, 2001; United States Patent No. 6,326,027 (Miller et a/.) issued December 4, 2001; and United States Patent No. 5,591,452 (Miller et at) issued January 7, 1997; and European Patent No. 1 190 712 (Vanderbist) published March 27, 2002.<br><br>
[0011]Although there are some controlled release tramadol HCI formulations on the market which purport to be once-daily formulations, none of these has successfully replaced twice-daily tramadol HCI formulations.<br>
[0012] Articles have been published in which comparative data between putative "once-daily" tramadol HCI formulations and immediate release tramadol HCI formulations are presented: Adler et a/M "A Comparison of Once-Daily Tramadol with Normal Release Tramadol in the Treatment of Pain in Osteoarthritis," The Journal of Rheumatology (2002) 29(10): 2195-2199; and Bodalia et a/., "A Comparison of the Pharmacokinetics, Clinical Efficacy, and Tolerability of Once-Daily Tramadol Tablets with Normal Release Tramadol Capsules," Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2003) 25(2): 142-149.<br>
Adverse Events from Administration of Tramadol HCI<br>
[0013]The most frequently reported side effects of tramadol observed in clinical trials in the United States are constipation, nausea, dizziness/vertigo, headache, somnolence and vomiting. These are typical adverse effects of opiate drugs. Seizures and anaphylactoid reactions have also been reported, though the estimated incidence of seizures in patients receiving tramadol HCI is less than 1% (Kazmierczak, R., and Coley, K.: "Doctor letters on prescribing: evaluation of the use of tramadol HCI." Formulary 32: 977-978,1997).<br>
[0014]Adler et a/., supra, reports on the results of a clinical study comparing a once daily tramadol formulation to immediate release tramadol in the treatment of-pain in osteoarthritis. The authors report similar adverse event profiles for individuals in both treatment groups. Table 2 of Adler et aL indicates that a greater percentage of people who were in the once daily treatment group withdrew due to adverse events than did those in the other treatment group.<br>
[0015] In Bodalia et al.t supra, the authors report comparable tolerability with a 150 mg once daily dose, a 200 mg once daily dose and three doses of a 50 mg normal release tramadol formulation. This article does not however include any information on how to make the formulations which are purported to be "once daily" nor does the article disclose any pharmacokinetic data after a single dose.<br>

[0036]The term "Rstarf is the time at which plasma concentrations begin to decline in a log-linear fashion, that is, the time at which either drug absorption or metabolite formation is complete.<br>
[0037]The word "tramadol", as used herein shall refer to tramadol, its stereoisomers and its pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts.<br>
[0038]The term "steady state" is defined for purposes of the present invention as the state, following multiple dose administration, where the rate of drug elimination matches the rate of input and the plasma drug concentrations at a given time within a dosing interval are approximately the same from one dosing interval to another.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
CORE<br>
[0047]The core of a tablet of the invention includes at least one active ingredient and a matrix, these components associated in such a way that release of the pharmaceutical ingredient from the matrix is controlled, in a specific embodiment, the matrix of the core is a cross-linked high amylose starch known under the name Contramid®, and described most recently in U.S. Patent No. 6,607,748 (Lenaerts et a/.), which issued August 19, 2003. A preferred formulation in the context of this invention is provided in the specification of U.S. Patent No. 6,607,748.<br>
[0048] Preferably, the core is formed by admixing the ingredients (in granular or powder form) and then compressing the mixture to form the core over which the coat is subsequently formed. The weight of the core can be any percentage of the weight of the total composition between 10% and 80%. The preferred percentage depends, upon other things, the total dosage of the pharmaceutical agent. In a particular embodiment described further below, a tablet contains 100 mg tramadol hydrochloride and the core is about 26% of the total weight of the tablet. In another embodiment, a tablet contains 200 mg tramadol hydrochloride and the core makes<br><br>
up about 33% of the total weight of the tablet. In yet another embodiment, a tablet contains 300 mg tramadol hydrochloride, and the core contributes 33% to the total weight of the tablet.<br>
Active Agent in the Core<br>
[0049] An active pharmaceutical ingredient is present in the core of the composition of the present invention. A suitable pharmaceutical ingredient of the present invention is any such ingredient that is desired to be delivered in a sustained-release dosage form. A comprehensive list of suitable pharmaceutical agents can be found in The Merck Index, 12th Ed. Preferably, the pharmaceutical ingredient is, but not limited to, isonicotinic acid hydrazide, sodium salicylate, pseudoephedrine hydrochloride, pseudoephedrine sulfate, acetaminophen or diclofenac sodium, verapamil, glipizide, nifedipine, felodipine, betahistine, albuterol, acrivastine, omeprazole, misoprostol, tramadol®, oxybutynin, trimebutine, ciprofloxacin, and salts thereof. In addition, the pharmaceutical agent can be an antifungal agent, such as ketoconazole, or an analgesic agent such as acetylsalicylic acid, acetaminophen, paracetamol, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, indomethacin, diflunisal, naproxen, ketorolac, diclofenac, tolmetin, sulindac, phenacetin, piroxicam, mefamanic acid, dextromethorphan, other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs including salicylates, pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts thereof or mixtures thereof. Pro-drugs are part of the invention.<br>
[0050]The solubility of the pharmaceutical agent in aqueous solution can be a wide variety of values. The aqueous solubility of the pharmaceutical agent can be less than 10"3 g/L, more than 10"3 g/L, more than 10"2 g/L, more than 10'1 g/L, more than 1 g/L, more than 10 g/L, more than 100 g/L, more than 500 g/L, more than 1000 g/L, or more than 2000 g/L Preferably, the solubility is more than 100 g/L. More preferably, the solubility is more than 500 g/L. Most preferably, the solubility is more than 1000 g/L<br>
[0051] The pharmaceutical agent can meet a variety of dosage requirement. For example, the dosage requirement of the pharmaceutical agent can be less than 1 mg/dosage unit, more than 1 mg/dosage unit, more than 10mg/dosage unit, more than 100 mg/dosage unit, more than 200 mg/dosage unit, more than 300 mg/dosage unit, more than 400 mg/dosage unit, more than 500 mg/dosage unit, or more than<br><br>
1000mg/dosage unit. Preferably, the pharmaceutical agent is more than 50mg/dosage unit. More preferably, the pharmaceutical agent is 100 mg/dosage unit, or more, e.g. 150 mg/dosage unit, or 200 mg/dosage unit, or 250 mg/dosage unit, or 300 mg/dosage unit, or more.<br>
[0052] Particular embodiments include a core containing tramadol hydrochloride in which the core contains between about 10% and 90% of the total tramadol present in the tablet, e.g. about 45 mg of a 100 mg strength tablet (45% of the tablet total), or about 90 of a 200 mg strength tablet (45% of the tablet total), or about 151 mg of a 300 mg strength tablet (50% of the tablet total).<br>
Matrix of the Core<br>
[0053]The release from the formulation of an active pharmaceutical ingredient located in the core is slower than the release of an active pharmaceutical ingredient located in the matrix of the coat. A preferred matrix of the core is cross-linked high amyiose starch, known under the name Contramid® and described in U.S. Patent No. 6,607,748. In particular embodiments, the matrix makes up between about 10% and about 90% by weight of the core i.e., the ratio of the matrix of the core to the active ingredient of the core (w/w) is between about 0.1 and about 10, or between about 0.2 and about 9, or between about 0.2 and about 8, or between about 0.3 and about 7, or between about 0.4 and about 6, or between about 0.5 and about 5, or between about 0.6 and about 4, or between about 0.7 and about 4 or between about 1 and about 4, or between about 1 and about 3 and about 1.5 and about 2.5. In one particular embodiment, the core totals about 90 mg, of which about 44 mg is Contramid®, and 45 mg is tramadol hydrochloride. In this case, Contramid® thus makes up about 49 weight percent of the core.<br>

[0060]The active agent is present at levels ranging from about 1 to about 90 wt.% of the total weight of the core, preferably from about 10 to about 70 wt.% of the total composition of the core, more preferably from about 20 to about 60 wt.% of the total composition of the core, and probably most often between about 30 to about 50 wt.% of the total composition of the core.<br>
[0061]Of course, the total amount of all components is 100 wt.%, and those of ordinary skill in the art can vary the amounts within the stated ranges to achieve useful compositions.<br>
COAT<br>
[0062]The coat of the dosage form includes a physical mixture of polyvinyl acetate and polyvinylpyrrolidone and the active pharmaceutical ingredient(s) of the coat. The coat can also include a cross-linked high amylose starch, e.g., Contramid®, and other optional components. In a preferred embodiment, the coat is formed by dry compression. The weight of the coat can be any percentage of the weight of the total<br><br>
composition between about 10% and about 90%, but is preferably in the higher part of this range. The coat thus usually makes up between about 20% to about 90%, (w/w) of a tablet of the invention, or about 25% to about 90%, or about 30% to about 85%, or about 35 % to about 85%, or about 40% to about 85%, or about 45% to about 85%, or about 45% to about 90%, or about 50% to about 90% or about 50% to about 85 %, or about 55% to about 90%, or about 55% to about 85%, or about 55% to about 80%, or about 60% to about 90%, or about 60% to about 85%, or about 60% to about 80%, or about 60% to about 75%, or about 65% to about 90%, or about 65% to about 85%, or about 65% to about 80%, or about 65% to about 75%, or about 65% or about 70% or about 75%.<br>
The coat often includes an optional binding agent.<br>
Polyvinyl Acetate and Polyvinylpyrrolidone of the Coat<br>
[0063] The weight percentage of the polyvinyl acetate/polyvinylpyrrolidone mixture in the coat can be anywhere within a wide range of values. Depending on the solubility in water of the active ingredient in the coat, the amount of the polyvinyl acetate/polyvinylpyrrolidone mixture in the coat can be adjusted. United States Patent Publication No. 2001/0038852 describes ways in which such adjustments can be made. For example, for active ingredients that are soluble to extremely soluble in water, polyvinyl acetate/polyvinylpyrrolidone mixture can be about 20 to about 80 wt.% of the coat, preferably about 30 to about 65 wt.%, or about 40 to about 55wt.%. In a particular embodiment described below, Kollidon™ SR makes up about 45% by weight of a coat that is about 31% by weight tramadol hydrochloride and about 23% xanthan gum. For active ingredients that are sparingly soluble to slightly soluble in water, the amount of polyvinyl acetate/polyvinylpyrrolidone mixture is often lower, as described in United States Patent Publication No. 2001/0038852.<br>
[0064]The weight ratio of polyvinyl acetate to polyvinylpyrrolidone in the polyvinyl acetate/polyvinylpyrrolidone mixture can be a wide range of values. Preferably, such ratio is between about 6:4 and 9:1; more likely between about 7:3 and 6:1, even more preferably about 8:2.<br>

or about 1,000 to about 1,000,000; or about 10,000 to about 1,000,000; or about 100,000 to about 1,000,000; or about 450,000.<br>
[0066] The molecular weight of the polyvinylpyrrolidone component in the polyvinyl acetate/polyvinylpyrrolidone mixture can be a wide range of values. The average molecular weight of the polyvinylpyrrolidone can be from about 100 to about 10,000,000; or about 1,000 to about 1,000,000; or about 5,000 to about 500,000; or about 10,000 to about 100,000; or about 50,000.<br>
[0067]The polyvinyl acetate and polyvinylpyrrolidone mixture can be prepared by a variety of processes including simply mixing powders of polyvinylpyrrolidone and polyvinyl acetate. In a preferred embodiment, such mixture is spray dried powder of a colloidal dispersion of polyvinyl acetate and polyvinylpyrrolidone solution. Optionally, sodium lauryl sulfate is used as a stabilizer in order to prevent agglomeration during spray drying process and/or colloidal silica is used to improve the flow properties of the polyvinyl acetate/polyvinylpyrrolidone mixture.

[GG85]The present invention will be more readily understood by referring to the following examples which are given to illustrate the invention rather than to limit its scope.<br>
EXAMPLES [0086] The cross-linked high amylose starch used in the these examples is made by a process comprising the steps of crosslinking and chemically modifying, followed by gelatinization and drying. Such process is described in more detail in U.S. Patent No. 6,607,748 (Lenaerts et ai.), which issued August 19, 2003, and known in the marketplace under the name Contramid®. and described in Examples 1 and 2.<br>

A.	Cross-Linking<br>
[0087] High amylose starch (30.0 kg) containing about 70% w/w of amylose (CI AmyloGel 03003) is placed in a reactor. To this reactor is added water (55.0 1) containing sodium hydroxide (30.0 g) and sodium sulfate (2.40 kg). The resulting slurry is heated to a temperature of 30°C. Phosphorus oxychloride (22.5 g) is added to the reaction mixture which is reacted for one hour.<br>
B.	Chemical Modification, Hydroxyproylation<br>
[0088] The crude reaction, mixture from Part A is transferred into a hydroxypropylation reactor. The reaction mixture is heated to 40°C. over 30 minutes and the reaction is purged with nitrogen. After a full purge, propylene oxide (1.80 kg) is added. The reaction mixture is kept at 40°C. for 20 hours. The reaction mixture is neutralized with 0.1 N H2SO4 (1:2 v/v) to a pH of 5.5. The starch slurry is washed with a basket-centrifuge at a speed of 1200 rpm. The obtained starch cake is re-siurrified in 35 I of water and centrifuged a second time. The resulting starch cake is dried in a flash dryer at an inlet temperature of 160°C. and an outlet temperature of 60°C.<br>
C.	Gelatinization<br>
[0089]The modified granular starch cake is diluted in demineralized water in order to form a slurry at a concentration of about 8% calculated on dry substance. The resulting slurry has a relative density of 1.032 kg/I compared to water. The pH of the<br><br>
modified starch slurry is adjusted to 6.0. The slurry is then heated to 160°C. by direct steam injection (Schlick Model 825). The temperature variation is not higher than ±1°C. The slurry is held in a holding column for a period of 4 minutes at a temperature of 160°C. and a pressure of about 5.5 bar. The pressure is then reduced to atmospheric by passing through a flash. The slurry is then contained at 95°C. in a hold tank. D. Spray-Drying<br><br>

desmethyltramadol plasma concentration which, after Tmax, declines in a slow but<br>
steady manner, reflecting continuing tramadol absorption and subsequent metabolite<br>
formation in addition to elimination processes.   Preferably, the decline in the O-<br>
desmethyltramadol plasma concentration occurs in a log-linear fashion with a mean<br>
apparent terminal elimination half-life of between about 6.7 hours and about 8.1<br>
hours.<br>

[00140]        A further embodiment of the present invention is to provide a once daily<br>
formulation which  upon  initial  ingestion  of a dose provides  a  mean  ratio of<br>
AUCo-24/AUCo~   of   O-desmethyltramadol   plasma   concentration   which   ranges<br>
between about 65% and about 80%.  Preferably, the mean ratio of AUCo-24AUCo-~ of<br>
O-desmethyltramadol plasma concentration ranges between about 68% and about<br>
75%.   As a result, about 25% to about 32% of the active metabolite is still circulating<br>

multiplied by the dose of tramadol) of from about 0.0025 to about 0.0035. Preferably<br>
the ratio is from about 0.0027 to about 0.0031.<br>
[00142]        O-desmethyltramadol pharmacokinetic parameters of the controlled<br>
release composition are presented in Table 3.<br><br><br><br>
Example 4<br>
(i) Dose Proportionality - Single Dose<br>
[00143] A bioavailability study was conducted to assess the dose-proportionality between three dosage strengths (100 mg, 200 mg and 300 mg). This study was conducted with a suitable washout period between each administration. The doses were taken by 27 healthy human volunteers under fasting conditions.<br>
[00144] Figure 3 depicts the mean plasma concentration time-profiles of tramadol obtained in the subjects after the administration of the inventive controlled release composition (dosed at 100 mg, 200 mg and 300 mg of tramadol HCI). The data used to create Figure 3 is included in Table 4.<br><br>
[00145] The results from this study indicated that the 100 mg, 200 mg and 300 mg formulations of the inventive controlled release composition are dose proportional with respect to the rate and extent of absorption of tramadol and the rate and extent of formation of O-desmethyltramadol.<br><br>
[00146]	Bioavailability studies were conducted in order to characterize the<br>
pharmacokinetic properties of the inventive controlled release composition and to demonstrate similar exposure of the drug and/or its active metabolite when compared to a reference product.<br>
Example 5 (ii) Comparison to a Twice-Daily Formulation - Single Dose<br>
[00147] The 2 x 200 mg dosage of the inventive controlled release composition was compared to the twice daily formulation, Topalgic® LP (200 mg) tablets manufactured by Laboratoires Hoechst Houde in a comparative bioavailability study after administration under fasting conditions in 24 healthy human volunteers.<br>
[00148] The pharmacokinetic results from the inventive controlled release composition were compared to those obtained following twice daily administration (at 12-hour intervals) of the reference formulation in order to assess bioequivalence between the test and the reference product. Based on calculation of the 90% confidence interval of the test versus reference ratios of geometric means, the extent of exposure (determined by assessment of AUCo-» and AUCo- of tramadol following dose normalization) was within the conventional bioequivalence interval of 80-125% for the log-transformed parameters. Thus the inventive controlled release composition and the twice daily formulation were found to be bioequivalent in terms of the overall exposure to tramadol. Results for tramadol AUCo- are presented in Table 5.<br><br>
[00149] Figure 5 depicts the arithmetic mean plasma concentration time-course profiles of tramadol obtained after the administration of the inventive controlled<br><br>
release composition once a day and of the reference product in one day at 12-hour intervals in the 24 healthy volunteers. The data used to create Figure 5 is included in Table 6. <br>
[00150] Figure 6 depicts the arithmetic mean plasma concentration time-course profiles of O-desmethyltramadol obtained after the administration of the inventive controlled release composition once-a-day and of the reference product in one day at 12-hour intervals in the 24 healthy volunteers. The data used to create Figure 6 is included in Table 7.<br><br><br>
Example 6<br>
(iii) Comparison to a Twice Daily Formulation - Steady State<br>
[00151] The 200 mg dosage of the inventive controlled release composition was compared to the twice daily formulation, Topalgic® LP (100 mg) tablets, manufactured by Laboratoires Hoechst Houde, in a comparative bioavailability study after multiple administration under fasting conditions in 26 healthy human volunteers.<br>
[00152] The results from this study indicated that the inventive controlled release composition is equivalent to the reference product with respect to the rate and extent of absorption of tramadol and the rate and extent of formation of O-desmethyltramadoi. The comparative bioavailability of the two products was assessed on the basis of the confidence interval for the primary variable AUC3S for<br><br>
tramadol and O-desmethyltramadol in relation to the conventional bioequivalence range of 80% to 125%. Results for tramadol AUCS8 are presented in Table 8.<br>
Table 8<br><br>
[00153] Figure 7 depicts the arithmetic mean plasma concentration time-course profiles of tramadol and O-desmethyltramadol following administration of a 200 mg dose of the inventive controlled release composition once a day and of the reference product (Topalgic® LP 100 mg BID) in one day at 12 hour intervals. The data used to create Figure 7 is included in Table 9.<br><br><br>
