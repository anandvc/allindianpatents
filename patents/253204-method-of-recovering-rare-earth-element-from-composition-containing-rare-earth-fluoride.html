TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a method of recovering rare earth elements from a<br>
composition containing rare earth fluorides. More specifically, the present invention<br>
relates to a method of recovering with high recovery rare earth elements from a<br>
composition containing rare earth fluorides, such as a rare earth abrasive containing a rare<br>
earth oxyfluoride or the like, that has already been used for polishing glass or the like, and<br>
also relates to a method of reproducing a rare earth abrasive.<br>
This application claims the priority of Japanese Patent Application No.<br>
2006-067725, filed March 13, 2006, the contents of which are incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In recent years, rare earth abrasives that contain fine powder of oxides of rare earth<br>
elements such as cerium (Ce), lanthanum (La), praseodymium (Pr), and neodymium (Nd)<br>
have been applied to various fields of technology. In particular, a rare earth abrasive<br>
disclosed in Patent Document 1 that contains rare earth fluorides is compatible to precise<br>
polishing processes, and has been often applied to polishing of glass materials or quartz<br>
crystals. For example, such a rare earth abrasive has been used for polishing, among<br>
others, glass substrates that are used for optical or magnetic disks, or used for liquid<br>
crystal displays such as a thin film transistor-type (TFT-type) liquid crystal display (LCD)<br>
and a twisted nematic-type (TN-type) liquid crystal display (LCD); a color filter for a<br>
liquid crystal television (TV); a cathode ray tube (CRT) for TV or the like; spectacle<br>
lenses; optical lenses; glass substrates for a LSI photomask; wired plate glass; substrates<br>
for a crystal oscillator.<br>
Ores that are raw materials for rare earth abrasives, for "example, include<br>
bastnaesite, monazite or the like. These ores has been mainly mined in China or in the<br>
U.S.A.<br><br>
In order to produce a rare earth oxide from ores such as a bastnaesite and<br>
monazite, the following treatments (1) to (9) are successively conducted in general.<br>
(1)	Sulfuric acid is added little by little to the ore in a rotary kiln, followed by mixing and<br>
drying.<br>
(2)	The ore is baked at 500°C to 600°C.<br>
(3)	Rare earth-containing contents are leached from the baked ore into water.<br>
(4)	The leaching solution is concentrated with a thickener, and impurities such as BaSO4,<br>
CaSO4, and SiO2 are removed by way of filtration whereby R2(SO4)3 is obtained. The<br>
"R" of the chemical formula refers to a rare earth element.<br>
(5)	SOdium sulfate is added to the obtained R2(SO4)3, and Fe, Ca, phosphoric acid or the<br>
like are separated whereby a sulfate composite salt of the rare earth element is obtained.<br>
(6)	SOdium hydroxide is added to the sulfate composite salt of the rare earth element<br>
whereby a hydroxide of the rare earth element is precipitated.<br><br>
(7)	Hydrochloric acid is added to the hydroxide of the rare earth element, thereby<br>
producing a chloride of the rare earth element.<br>
(8)	Ammonium hydrogencarbonate is added to the chloride of the rare earth element,<br>
thereby producing a rare earth carbonate.<br>
(9)	The rare earth carbonate is baked, thereby producing a rare earth oxide.<br>
However, the reserves of the ores that are raw materials for producing the rare<br>
earth abrasives are limited. Furthermore, in recent years, there has been a problem in<br>
which the raw material ores are quite scarce as the demand for the rare earth abrasives<br>
increases.<br>
Therefore, various methods of recovering the rare earth elements from the waste<br>
fluid of the rare earth abrasives have been developed in order to recycle them as<br>
abrasives.<br>
For example, Patent Document 2 discloses a method of recovering rare earth<br>
elements from a rare earth abrasive that has been already used. The disclosed method<br><br>
includes the steps of: dissolving rare earth elements included in the used rare earth<br>
abrasive by treating the abrasive with an aqueous mineral acid solution; collecting the<br>
rare earth element-dissolving solution by separating it from the insoluble contents by way<br>
of solid-liquid separation; precipitating the rare earth elements as oxalates by adding<br>
oxalic acid and an alkali solution of oxalic acid, such that the pH of the collected solution<br>
becomes 5 or less; recovering the oxalates of the rare earth elements by way of<br>
solid-liquid separation; treating the oxalates of the rare earth elements with an aqueous<br>
alkali hydroxide solution, thereby converting them to hydroxides of the rare earth<br>
elements, and producing an alkali solution of oxalic acid; and collecting separately the<br>
hydroxides of the rare earth elements and the alkali solution of the oxalic acid by way of<br>
solid-liquid separation, wherein the collected alkali solution of oxalic acid is recycled in<br>
the step of the oxalate-salt precipitation.<br>
On the other hand, Patent Document 3 discloses a method of recovering rare<br>
earth elements as rare earth oxides. This method includes the steps of: mixing an acid into<br>
a solution containing rare earth elements, and heating the mixed solution, in order to<br>
dissolve the rare earth elements therein; removing the insoluble contents from the rare<br>
earth element-dissolving solution; adding a soluble carbonate, a soluble<br>
hydrogencarbonate, or oxalic acid thereto, thereby converting the rare earth elements<br>
present in the solution into rare earth carbonates or rare earth oxalates; separating the rare<br>
earth carbonate or the rare earth oxalate from the slurry containing them; and baking the<br>
separated rare earth carbonate or rare earth oxalate to produce rare earth oxides.<br>
These methods are suitable for recovering rare earth elements from a polishing<br>
waste fluid of abrasives containing only a rare earth oxide. However, when these methods<br>
are applied to waste fluids of the abrasives containing rare earth fluorides such as rare<br>
earth oxyfluorides, their recovering efficiency of the rare earth elements is low, and it is<br>
generally 80% or less.<br>

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a method of recovering with high<br>
recovery rare earth elements from a composition containing rare earth fluorides, such as a<br>
rare earth abrasive containing a rare earth oxyfluoride or the like, that has already been<br>
used for polishing glass or the like. Furthermore, another object of the present invention is<br>
to provide a method of reproducing a rare earth abrasive.<br>
The present inventors studied intensively the above-mentioned conventional<br>
methods of recovering the rare earth elements. Accordingly, they discovered that rare<br>
earth fluorides such as rare earth oxyfluorides do not dissolve in an acid by way of the<br>
conventional methods, and they are included in an insoluble content in the form of a rare<br>
earth fluoride or the like. The insoluble content includes polishing wastes, waste particles<br>
of the polishing pad, fragments of glass or the like, and therefore, it is very cosdy to<br>
retrieve pure rare earth elements from such a mixture, and it is not practical.<br>
Therefore, the present inventors further studied a method of reducing the rare earth<br>
elements in the insoluble content by way of dissolving both a rare earth oxide and a rare<br>
earth fluoride. Consequently, it was discovered that rare earth fluorides can be completely<br>
dissolved by way of adding silicon oxide to a composition containing a rare earth fluoride,<br>
followed by heating the mixture in a hydrochloric acid aqueous solution, and that the rare<br>
earth elements were no longer included in the insoluble content. The present invention<br>

fluoride, such as a rare earth abrasive containing a rare earth oxyfluoride which has been<br>
used for polishing glass or the like. Furthermore, the retrieved rare earth element has an<br>
excellent quality, and therefore, it can be reproduced into a rare earth abrasive or the like<br>
containing a rare earth fluoride which is used for processes of fine polishing.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The method of recovering a rare earth element from a composition containing a<br>
rare earth fluoride of the present invention includes: (1) mixing a composition containing<br><br>
a rare earth fluoride, silicon oxide, and hydrochloric acid; (2) heating the mixture,<br>
whereby the rare earth fluoride is dissolved therein; (3) removing an insoluble content<br>
from the solution obtained at step (2), whereby a rare earth-containing solution is<br>
obtained; and (4) recovering the rare earth element from the rare earth-containing solution<br>
obtained at step (3)..<br>
The composition containing a rare earth fluoride that is applicable to the present<br>
invention includes, for example, an abrasive containing a rare earth fluoride, a polishing<br>
waste fluid produced after polishing using such an abrasive, among others. In addition,<br>
the polishing waste fluid may be concentrated or dried into a solid, or may remain as a<br>
liquid. The rare earth fluoride includes a fluorinated rare earth, rare earth oxyfluoride, or<br>
the like.<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention is described with respect to each step in the<br>
case where the composition containing a rare earth fluoride is a waste fluid of a rare earth<br>
abrasive containing a rare earth fluoride.<br>
Step (1): the composition containing a rare earth fluoride (a waste fluid of a rare<br>
earth abrasive containing a rare earth fluoride) is mixed with silicon oxide and<br>
hydrochloric acid.<br>
As described in Patent Document 1, the rare earth abrasive containing a rare<br>
earth fluoride mainly contains a rare earth oxide such as cerium oxide (for example,<br>
CeO2), lanthanum oxide (for example, La2O3), and praseodymium oxide (for example,<br>
Pr6O11); a rare earth fluoride such as cerium oxyfluoride (for example, Ce3O4F3),<br>
lanthanum oxyfluoride, and praseodymium oxyfluoride; and a composite compound<br>
thereof. Such an abrasive is generally used for polishing a glass material or quartz crystal.<br>
The used abrasive (i.e. polishing waste fluid) includes extraneous materials such as<br>
polishing wastes, wastes particles of the polishing pad, and fragments of glass.<br>
On a solids basis, such a waste fluid of an abrasive generally contains 4% to 10%<br>
by mass of fluorine, 40% to 90% by mass of cerium on a cerium oxide-basis, 5% to 55%<br><br>
by mass of lanthanum on a lanthanum oxide-basis, and 1% to 10% by mass of<br>
praseodymium on a praseodymium oxide-basis although the contents may vary<br>
depending on how the abrasive is used for polishing. In addition, the solids basis refers to<br>
a ratio of the element, or means that a ratio of a given element is represented by a ratio of<br>
an oxide of the element on the supposition that the mass of the solid content dried at<br>
120°C is l00%.<br>
The waste fluid of the abrasive that has been used for polishing glass materials<br>
may include a glass content (i.e. silicon oxide). In order to recycle the abrasive for a fine<br>
polishing process, it is required to remove such a glass content. Silicon oxide is mixed<br>
into the waste fluid in the present invention although silicon oxide should be removed<br>
from the waste fluid in general. The silicon oxide present in the waste fluid that has been<br>
used for glass polishing does not improve solubility of the rare earth fluoride therein<br>
while the new silicon oxide added thereto is considered to improve the solubility of the<br>
rare earth fluoride although the reason such a difference is present is not obvious in detail.<br>
It is estimated that the surface condition of the silicon oxide previously present in the<br>
waste fluid is different from that of the newly mixed silicon oxide.<br>
Therefore, even if glass-polishing or the like results in the increase of silicon<br>
oxide in the waste fluid of the abrasive, it is required to mix fresh silicon oxide into the<br>
waste fluid in order to achieve effects of the present invention.<br>
The silicon oxide mixed into the waste fluid is not particularly limited in terms of<br>
its form. However, it is preferable that the silicon oxide be at least in a form of particles<br>
which contain silicon oxide on their surface in order to attain a larger area of the reaction<br>
interface. Such particles containing silicon oxide, for example, include colloidal silica,<br>
white carbon, fumed silica, glass beads, and silica gel. It is preferable that the particles<br>
containing silicon oxide have a narrower particle size distribution because the solid-liquid<br>
separation can be easily conducted. In addition, it is preferable that the particle size of<br>
the particle containing silicon oxide be smaller (for example, 1 nm to 100 nm) or be larger<br>
(for example, 10 µm to 5000 µm) than those of the extraneous materials such as polishing<br>
wastes, waste particles of the polishing pad, and fragments of glass because this makes it<br><br>
easier to remove such extraneous materials.<br>
It is preferable that the total surface area of the particles containing silicon oxide<br>
which are mixed into the waste fluid of the abrasive be broader because this can shorten<br>
the reaction time. For example, it is preferable that the total surface area be 300 cm2 or<br>
more with respect to 1 g of the fluorine present in the waste fluid, more preferably 1000<br>
cm2 or more.<br>
53 parts by mass or more of the silicon oxide can be preferably added with<br>
respect to 100 parts by mass of the fluorine present in the waste fluid of the abrasive, and<br>
80 parts by mass or more thereof can be more preferably added. The maximum limit of<br>
the silicon oxide added can be determined by considering the cost, the usability or the like,<br>
and therefore, is not particularly limited. However, it may be up to about 1,000,000 parts<br>
by mass. ,<br>
In addition, the material for the inner surface of a reactor which is used for the<br>
retrieving treatment may be glass. Glass is corroded by a fluorine content, and therefore,<br>
use of a glass reactor is avoided in a chemical reaction using a fluorine compound.<br>
However, the corrosion of the inner surface of the glass reactor is suppressed in a reaction<br>
that occurs when the mixture of the waste fluid of the abrasive, silicon oxide, and<br>
hydrochloric acid is heated. Accordingly, for example, a glass-lined reactor can be used in<br>
the present invention.<br>
The concentration of hydrochloric acid that is mixed with the waste fluid of the<br>
abrasive is not particularly limited. However, the concentration is generally within a rage<br>
of 15% to 45% by mass, and preferably 20% to 35% by mass, and concentrated<br>
hydrochloric acid (for example, 35% by mass) can be used. The amount of the<br>
hydrochloric acid mixed therein is preferably within a range of 200 parts to 2200 parts by<br>
mass, and more preferably within a range of 727 parts to 2200 parts by mass with respect<br>
to 100 parts by mass of the solid content present in the waste fluid of the abrasive, based<br>
on 35% by mass hydrochloric acid.<br><br>
Step (2): the mixture of the waste fluid, silicon oxide, and hydrochloric acid is<br>
heated, thereby dissolving the rare earth fluoride.<br>
The heating treatment is continued until the rare earth elements present in the<br>
waste fluid of the abrasive (they are generally in a form of an oxide or fluoride) are<br>
sufficiently dissolved therein. It is preferable that the heating temperature be within a<br>
range of 60°C to the boiling temperature of the mixture. The period for heating the<br>
mixture is preferably within a range of 10 minutes to 10 hours, and more preferably<br>
within a range of 0.5 hours to 6 hours. The heating treatment is conducted under reflux.<br>
Then, the reflux is terminated, the mixture is concentrated by way of heating, and a part of<br>
the hydrochloric acid can be retrieved by cooling the generated vapor. The retrieved<br>
hydrochloric acid can be reused at step (1).<br>
Thus, the mixture of the waste fluid of the abrasive, silicon oxide, and<br>
hydrochloric acid is heated whereby rare earth oxides and rare earth fluorides are<br>
dissolved therein, and an acidic aqueous solution in which the rare earth elements are<br>
dissolved can be obtained. Although the details of the mechanism are not apparent, it is<br>
considered that the rare earth elements are dissolved therein as rare earth chlorides.<br>
Glass polishing wastes present in the waste fluid of the abrasive become a silica sol, its<br>
gelation further proceeds, and they finally turn into an insoluble silica gel.<br>
The insoluble contents such as the silica gel and the waste particles of the<br>
polishing pad may be separated directly from the solution obtained at step (2) by way of<br>
filtration. When a large volume of the acidic aqueous solution of the rare earth elements is<br>
kept in insoluble contents, it is preferable mat the solution be concentrated by way of<br>
heating in order to retrieve the acidic aqueous solution of the rare earth elements at a high<br>
recovery yield.<br>
When it is concentrated by way of heating, the density (concentration) of the<br>
solution becomes high. Consequently, the silica gel becomes relatively lighter, and the<br>
silica gel floats with pad wastes or the like upon the liquid surface. This makes it easier to<br>
conduct the next step (3). In addition, hydrochloric acid is retrieved by condensing the<br><br>
vapor generated while concentrating the solution by way of heating. The retrieved<br>
hydrochloric acid can be reused at step (1).<br>
If the acidic aqueous solution is further heated to be concentrated, its liquid<br>
surface declines, and the silica gel and the insoluble contents floated on the liquid surface<br>
adhere to the inner wall of the reaction vessel, and they are fixed thereon. When the<br>
amount of the silica gel and the insoluble contents is too much for the area of the inner<br>
wall of the reaction vessel, a partition plate or the like may be provided inside the reaction<br>
vessel in order to increase the area of the inner wall. The volume of the silica gel and<br>
insoluble contents that are fixed on the inner wall is reduced, and the acidic aqueous<br>
solution of the rare earth elements that remain in the silica gel and the insoluble contents<br>
are released when the temperature further increases. Therefore, it is preferable that the<br>
temperature of the inner wall, the partition plate, etc. be kept at the temperature of the<br>
aqueous solution or more in order to easily cause the reduction of the volume. It is<br>
preferable that the aqueous solution be concentrated to about 25% to 75% of the initial<br>
volume before heating, more preferably about 40% to 60%. As the separation between the<br>
silica gel and the insoluble contents, and the acidic aqueous solution of the rare earth<br>
elements proceeds by way of the heat-concentration treatment, the recovery yield of the<br>
acidic aqueous solution of the rare earth elements improves at the next step (3).<br>
It is preferable that the acidic aqueous solution of the rare earth elements be<br>
concentrated while generating bubbles therein. It is more preferable that fine and uniform<br>
bubbles be generated. If a boiling chip is put into the aqueous solution, the bubbles are<br>
repeatedly generated around the boiling chip by way of heating, and the generated<br>
bubbles becomes fine and uniform. The silica gel and the insoluble contents float on the<br>
liquid surface with the bubbles. Thus, the separation between the silica gel and the<br>
insoluble contents, and the acidic aqueous solution of the rare earth elements is improved<br>
at step (3).<br>
In addition, as examples of the boiling chip, ceramics such as glass or plastics<br>
that are insoluble in the hot solution can be selected. It is preferable that the boiling chip<br>
have numerous projections on its surface from which the bubbles are generated.<br><br>
Step (3): obtaining a rare earth-containing solution by removing the insoluble<br>
contents from the solution obtained at step (2).<br>
After the step of (2), the acidic aqueous solution of the rare earth elements is<br>
taken out from the reaction vessel, and the insoluble contents are removed by separating<br>
them from the solution. The method of separating the insoluble contents is not<br>
particularly limited. However, solid-liquid separation procedures such as filtration and<br>
centrifugation can be applied for removing the insoluble contents. In particular, filtration<br>
is preferable because of its ease in carrying out. In this way, an acidic aqueous solution in<br>
which the insoluble contents are removed can be obtained.<br>
The removal of the insoluble contents may include steps where the solution is<br>
separated into a rare earth-containing solution, silicon oxide, and other insoluble contents<br>
other than silicon oxide. For example, such methods include a method in which unreacted<br>
silicon oxide (particles such as glass beads) is removed, and then, silica gels and other<br>
insoluble contents other than silicon oxide (for example, waste particles of the polishing<br>
pad) are removed. Also, the rare earth-containing solution and the insoluble contents may<br>
be first separated, followed by separating silicon oxide from the insoluble contents by<br>
way of filtration. The separated silicon oxide can be reused at step (1).<br>
In addition, the obtained rare earth-containing solution is diluted with water, and<br>
concentrated by way of heating whereby hydrochloric acid may be retrieved from the<br>
solution in the same manner as step (2). The retrieved hydrochloric acid can be reused at<br>
step (1).<br>
Step (4): rare earth elements are retrieved from the rare earth-containing solution<br>
obtained at step (3).<br>
The solution (acidic aqueous solution of the rare earth elements) obtained at step<br>
(3) is a solution which hardly contains impurities, and in which rare earth elements are<br>
dissolved. To reproduce an abrasive or the like from the solution, the rare earth elements<br><br>
can be retrieved, for example, by way of the following method.<br>
First, a soluble carbonate, soluble hydrogen carbonate or oxalic acid is added to<br>
the acidic aqueous solution of the rare earth elements, thereby precipitating the rare earth<br>
elements. The precipitates are rare earth carbonates or rare earth oxalates.<br>
The soluble carbonates or soluble hydrogen carbonates may be salts soluble in<br>
the solution (acidic solution) obtained at step (3). Alkali metal salts, alkali earth metal<br>
salts, or ammonium salts are preferably used. The alkali metals include, for example,<br>
sodium, potassium, lithium or the like. In particular, sodium and potassium are preferable.<br>
The alkali earth metals include, for example, calcium, strontium, barium or the like. With<br>
regard to carbonates and hydrogen carbonates of the alkali metals, alkali earth metals, or<br>
ammonium, sodium hydrogen carbonate, potassium hydrogen carbonate, and ammonium<br>
hydrogen carbonate are preferable, and ammonium hydrogen carbonate is more<br>
preferable.<br>
Prior to adding the carbonates, the hydrogen carbonates, or oxalic acid, the<br>
acidic aqueous solution of the rare earth elements can be diluted with water in order to<br>
control particle size where necessary. In general, the higher the dilution ratio, the larger<br>
the particle size of the obtained particles becomes.<br>
Moreover, it is preferable that the pH of the acidic aqueous solution of the rare<br>
earth elements be adjusted to 1 to 7 prior to adding the carbonates, the hydrogen<br>
carbonates, or oxalic acid thereto. It is more preferable that the pH be adjusted to 1 to 4.<br>
In addition, it is most preferable that ammonium hydrogen carbonate or oxalic acid be<br>
added thereto after the adjustment of the pH. The adjustment of the pH can be conducted<br>
by adding an alkaline content such as aqueous ammonium, sodium hydroxide, potassium<br>
hydroxide, and calcium hydroxide. However, it is preferable that aqueous ammonium be<br>
preferably used because it is easier to remove the alkaline content. For example, if<br>
aqueous ammonium is chosen, its concentration is not limited, but it may be generally<br>
selected within a range of 5% to 28% by mass.<br><br>
The soluble carbonate or hydrogen carbonates can be added to the acidic<br>
aqueous solution of the rare earth elements in a form of solid or aqueous solution.<br>
However, the aqueous solution is preferable.<br>
The concentration of the aqueous solution of the soluble carbonate or the soluble<br>
hydrogen carbonate, or oxalic acid solution is not particularly limited, but it can be<br>
generally selected within a range of 5% to 97% by mass.<br>
It is preferable that the amount of the soluble carbonate or the hydrogen<br>
carbonate, or oxalic acid, added thereto, be within a range of 96 parts to 180 parts by mass<br>
with respect to 100 parts by mass of the rare earth elements.<br>
The acidic aqueous solution containing rare earth elements turns into a slurry<br>
that contains rare earth carbonates or rare earth oxalates when the above-described<br>
carbonate or hydrogen carbonate, or oxalic acid is added thereto.<br>
The slurry is subjected to the solid-liquid separation, thereby collecting the<br>
precipitates. For example, the slurry including rare earth carbonates or rare earth oxalates<br>
is subjected to filtration or centrifugation whereby the precipitates of the rare earth<br>
carbonates, the rare earth oxalates or the like can be collected. The separated rare earth<br>
carbonates or the rare earth oxalates may be washed with water, and may be subjected<br>
again to the solid-liquid separation if desired.<br>
Next, the collected precipitates of the rare earth carbonates or the rare earth<br>
oxalates are baked or reacted with hydrofluoric acid.<br>
Step (4-1): if the precipitates are baked, then, they turn into rare earth oxides<br>
such as oxidized rare earth.<br>
With regard to the baking treatment, the rare earth carbonates or the rare earth<br>
oxalates are baked in the atmosphere, generally at 600°C to 1200°C, preferably at<br>
800°C to 1100°C, and generally for about 0.5 hours to 3 hours, preferably for 0.5 hours to<br><br>
2 hours. Such a baking treatment makes it possible to obtain rare earth oxides. A general<br>
baking furnace such as a box-type furnace, rotary furnace and tunnel kiln can be used as a<br>
baking device.<br>
The rare earth oxides obtained by way of baking are retrieved, crushed, and<br>
assigned into certain grain sizes (particle size and particle distribution), and the grain<br>
sizes are adjusted whereby they can be recycled as an abrasive for fine polishing. In<br>
general, they may be adjusted to the original particle size, but their particle size may be<br>
different. For example, the average particle size can be adjusted within a range of 0.1 µm<br>
to 2 µm.<br>
Step (4-2): if the precipitates are reacted with hydrofluoric acid, then, they turn<br>
into rare earth fluorides such as fluorinated rare earth.<br>
In general, the precipitates of the rare earth carbonate or the rare earth oxalates<br>
are mixed with hydrofluoric acid whereby fluorinated rare earth is obtained. The<br>
hydrofluoric acid may be added at the equivalent to the rare earth carbonates or the rare<br>
earth oxalates or more. The concentration of the hydrofluoric acid solution is not<br>
particularly limited, but a 5% to 65% solution is preferable.<br>
Step (4-3): the rare earth oxides obtained at step (4-1), and the rare earth<br>
fluorides obtained at step (4-2) are mixed at a desired ratio, and baked to obtain a mixture<br>
including the rare earth oxides and the rare earth oxyfluorides. After the mixture is<br>
crushed, and adjusted to a predetermined grain size (particle size and particle distribution),<br>
it can be reused as an abrasive for fine polishing. In general, it may be adjusted to the<br>
original particle size, but the particle size may be different. For example, the average<br>
particle size can be adjusted within a range of 0.1 µm to 2 µm.<br>
As described above, an abrasive including rare earth oxides, or an abrasive<br>
including rare earth oxides and rare earth oxyfluorides can be reproduced from the waste<br>
fluid of the abrasive that includes rare earth fluorides. In the present invention, most of the<br>
rare earth elements present in the waste fluid can be recycled. Therefore, the present<br><br>
invention can achieve a method of recycling that is cost-effective compared with<br>
conventional methods.<br>
Furthermore, a treatment of concentrating the solid contents may also be<br>
conducted before the above-described step (1). For example, the method of concentration<br>
such as filtration, and the sedimentation method using a flocculant can be mentioned. If a<br>
flocculant is used, for example, aluminum sulfate, polyaluminum chloride, or a<br>
polymerer flocculant can be added to the waste fluid containing the rare earth fluorides in<br>
order to allow the solid contents containing the rare earth elements to settle. Then, the<br>
sediment of the solid contents is separated and collected from the solution. This treatment<br>
is considered as a pretreatment conducted before the above-described step (1). After the<br>
pretreatment, the collected sediment is mixed with silicone oxide and hydrochloric acid.<br>
Aluminum sulfate and polyaluminum chloride can be used in a form of either<br>
solid or an aqueous solution (generally a concentration of 10% by mass or more). The<br>
polymer flocculant applied to the present invention includes, for example, commercial<br>
products such as "Kurifloc" (produced by KURITA WATER INDUTIRY LTD.), and<br>
"Orfloc" (produced by ORGANO CORPORATION).<br>
The rare earth oxides and the rare earth oxyfluorides retrieved by way of the<br>
above-described steps (1) to (4) are crushed, and adjusted into uniform grain sizes<br>
(particle size and particle distribution). Then, they are recycled as abrasives used for fine<br>
polishing.<br>
The application of the reproduced abrasives is identical to that of the original<br>
abrasives that include fine powder of oxides of the rare earth elements such as cerium<br>
(Ce), lanthanum (La), praseodymium (Pr), and neodymium (Nd), produced from the ores.<br>
Its application fields includes, for example, polishing of glass substrates that are<br>
used for optical or magnetic disks, or used for liquid crystal displays such as a thin film<br>
transistor-type (TFT-type) liquid crystal display (LCD) and a twisted nematic-type<br>
(TN-type) liquid crystal display (LCD); a color filter for a liquid crystal television (TV); a<br><br>
cathode ray tube (CRT) for TV or the like; spectacle lenses; optical lenses; glass<br>
substrates for a LSI photomask;,wired plate glass; substrates for a crystal oscillator.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention is described in detail with reference to<br>
Examples. However, the present invention is not limited to Examples. In addition,<br>
"part" and "%" refer to "part by mass" and "% by mass", respectively, unless specified.<br>
(Example 1)<br>
An abrasive that had a composition of rare earth oxides and rare earth<br>
oxyfluorides, shown in Table 1, and whose average particle size was 1.8 µm was used for<br>
polishing a 2.5-inch strengthened glass substrate that included mainly aluminosilicate.<br>
The polishing treatment was conducted by using a four-way-type double-side polishing<br>
machine (Type "5B" produced by Fujikoshi Machinery Corp.). The polishing conditions<br>
were as follows. The slurry concentration was 10%; the slurry-supplying rate was 500<br>
ml/rnin; the platen-rotating speed was 90 rpm; the processing pressure was 100 g/cm2;<br>
and the polishing time was 30 minutes. The processing rate was 1 µm/min in this<br>
polishing process, and the surface roughness of the glass substrate was 0.9 nm after the<br>
polishing process. The obtained glass substrate by way of this polishing process was used<br>
for evaluating the recycled abrasives as described below. The composition of the waste<br>
fluid generated in this polishing process is shown in Table 1. The content of SiO2<br>
increased compared with the composition of the original abrasive because of the inclusion<br>
of polishing wastes. A part of the waste fluid was concentrated by way of filtration such<br>
that its solid content becomes 30%.<br>
100 parts (solids basis) of the waste fluid of 30% solid content, 8 parts of<br>
colloidal silica ("AEROSIL200" produced by JAPAN AEROSIL), and 1500 parts of 35%<br>
hydrochloric acid were transferred into a glass container that was equipped with a reflux<br>
device and a stirrer whereby the mixture thereof was obtained. The mixture was heated to<br>
104°C. After ten minutes, the red slurry of the waste fluid turned into a yellow or green<br><br>
transparent liquid. After a while when heating was terminated, and the slurry was allowed<br>
to stand, a gel-like insoluble content remained on the bottom of the glass container.<br>
The insoluble content was removed from the solution by way of filtration. It was<br>
found that the insoluble content hardly contained rare earth elements.<br>
The solution from which the insoluble content was removed was transferred to a<br>
glass container, and diluted with pure water, thereby doubling the volume. The solution<br>
was then heated to 108°C, and the hydrochloric acid excessively present therein was<br>
retrieved by way of distillation. Heating was terminated, and the concentrated solution<br>
was cooled to room temperature, and then, pure water was added thereto such that the<br>
volume became identical to that of the solution before being concentrated. The pH of the<br>
solution was adjusted to 2 by adding 5% aqueous ammonia dropwise while stirring.<br>
1400 parts of a 10% aqueous solution of ammonium hydrogen carbonate was added to the<br>
adjusted solution while stirring whereby a white precipitate of rare earth carbonates was<br>
obtained.<br>
The solution was filtrated, and the obtained white precipitate was washed with<br>
water. Then, this solid content was transferred to a porcelain container, and baked at<br>
800°C for one hour whereby rare earth oxides were obtained. The product was crushed,<br>
and sorted in terms of particle size, thereby reproducing an abrasive whose average<br>
particle size was 0.5 µm. The composition of the recycled abrasive is shown in Table 1.<br>
The recovering efficiency of the rare earth elements was 96%.<br>
The above-described polished glass substrate was subjected to a finish polishing<br>
process by using the above recycled abrasive. The polishing process was conducted by<br>
using a four-way-type double-side polishing machine (Type "5B" produced by Fujikoshi<br>
Machinery Corp.) that was equipped with a suede-type polishing pad. The polishing<br>
conditions were as follows. The slurry concentration was 10%; the slurry-supplying rate<br>
was 60 ml/min; the platen-rotating speed was 90 rpm; the processing pressure was 75<br>
g/cm2; and the polishing time was 10 minutes. The processing rate was 0.7 µm/min in this<br>
polishing process, and the surface roughness of the polished glass substrate was 0.3 nm.<br><br>
(Example 2)<br>
In the same manner as Example 1, a white precipitate of rare earth carbonates<br>
was obtained. 50 parts of 55% hydrofluoric acid were mixed into 100 parts of the white<br>
precipitate, and the mixture was heated at 350oC for two hours, thereby producing white<br>
rare earth fluorides. 30 parts of the rare earth fluorides, and 100 parts of the rare earth<br>
oxides obtained in Example 1 were mixed, and baked at 900°C. Then, the mixture was<br>
crushed and sorted in terms of particle size whereby an abrasive that contained fluorine<br>
and rare earth elements, and whose average particle size was 1.8 urn was obtained. The<br>
composition of the recycled abrasive is shown in Table 1. The recovering efficiency of the<br>
rare earth elements was 94%.<br>
A 2.5-inch strengthened glass substrate which mainly contained aluminosilicate<br>
was subjected to the polishing process by using the above recycled abrasive. The<br>
polishing process was conducted by using a four-way-type double-side polishing<br>
machine (Type "5B" produced by Fujikoshi Machinery Corp.) that was equipped with a<br>
urethane-type polishing pad. The polishing conditions were as follows. The slurry<br>
concentration was 10%; the slurry-supplying rate was 500 ml/min; the platen-rotating<br>
speed was 90 rpm; the processing pressure was 100 g/cm2; and the polishing time was 30<br>
minutes. The processing rate was 1 µm/min in this polishing process, and the surface<br>
roughness of the glass substrate was 0.9 nm after the polishing process.<br>
(Example 3)<br>
A polishing waste fluid was obtained in the same manner as Example 1. The<br>
waste fluid was dried, and the remaining content was crushed, thereby obtaining a brown<br>
powder. 100 parts of the brown powder; 1500 parts of hydrochloric acid (density: 1.096<br>
g/cm3, about 20% concentration) obtained in the same manner as Example 1; and 320<br>
parts of glass beads having a diameter of 0.2 mm were transferred into a glass container<br>
equipped with a reflux device, and a mixture thereof was obtained. The mixture was<br>
heated to 106°C. After five hours, the red slurry of the waste fluid turned into a yellow or<br><br>
green transparent liquid. After a while when heating was terminated, and the slurry was<br>
allowed to stand, a gel-like product and glass beads remained in the bottom of the glass<br>
container.<br>
The container was heated again whereby 500 parts of hydrochloric acid were<br>
collected by way of distillation at 109°C.<br>
Heating was terminated, and the insoluble content remaining in the bottom of the<br>
glass container was separated and removed from the concentrated solution by way of<br>
filtration. The insoluble content was washed with water in a stainless steel sieve having a<br>
pore size of 100 µm whereby glass beads were retrieved.<br>
The solution from which the insoluble content was removed was transferred to a<br>
glass container, and diluted with water, thereby doubling its volume. A 5% sodium<br>
hydroxide aqueous solution was added dropwise to the solution while stirring whereby<br>
the pH was adjusted to 2. 1800 parts of 8% sodium hydrogen carbonate aqueous solution<br>
were added to the solution while stirring whereby a white precipitate of rare earth<br>
carbonates was obtained.<br>
The above solution was then filtered, and the remaining white precipitate was<br>
washed with water. The obtained solid content was transferred to a porcelain container,<br>
and baked at 700°C for two hours whereby rare earth oxides were obtained. Furthermore,<br>
100 parts of the solid content obtained by washing the white precipitate with water after<br>
filtration were mixed with 50 parts of 55% hydrofluoric acid, and heated to 350°C for two<br>
hours whereby white rare earth fluorides were obtained. 30 parts of the rare earth<br>
fluorides were mixed with 100 parts of the above-obtained rare earth oxides, and 200<br>
parts of pure water, and the mixture was water-ground such that the average particle size<br>
became 2 µm. The particles were baked at 950°C, further crushed and sorted based on<br>
particle sizes whereby abrasive which contained fluorine and rare earth elements, and<br>
whose average particle size was 1.6 µm was reproduced. The composition of the<br>
reproduced abrasive is shown in Table 1. The recovering efficiency of the rare earth<br>
elements was 96%.<br><br><br>
* The contents of Ce, La, Nd, Pr, Si, F, and CI were analyzed by way of elemental analysis.<br>
Ce, La, Nd, Pr, and Si were converted to contents by mass of CeO2, La2O3, Nd2CO3, Pr6O11,<br>
and SiO2, respectively (oxide basis), and the contents of F and CI were calculated by mass<br>
as elements, and the remainder was regarded as "Other". In addition, the mass of the solid<br>
content where the mass became constant by way of drying at 120°C was considered to be<br>
100%. The analysis of Ce, La, Nd, Pr, and Si was conducted by using the ICP<br>
luminescence method, and the analysis of F and CI was conducted by way of ion<br>
chromatography.<br>
(Comparative Example 1)<br>
An abrasive was reproduced in the same manner as Example 1 except that no<br>
silicon oxide was added. It was evident that the insoluble content contained rare earth<br>
elements that were present as yellow rare earth fluorides or the like. The recovering<br>
efficiency of the rare earth elements was 75%.<br><br>
Thus, according to the present invention, the rare earth elements present in an<br>
abrasive can be retrieved at high yield, i.e. 90% or more, and an abrasive that has the same<br>
quality as that of the original abrasive can be reproduced.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
According to present invention, namely the method of recovering a rare earth<br>
element from a composition that contains rare earth fluorides, rare earth elements can be<br>
retrieved at low cost and at high yield from a composition containing rare earth fluorides<br>
such as rare earth abrasives containing rare earth oxyfluorides which have been used for<br>
polishing glass or the like. Therefore, this results in saving material resources of the ores<br>
which are raw materials for rare earth abrasives. Moreover, the hydrochloric acid used in<br>
the steps of the method can be recycled, and this further results in material saving.<br>
Furthermore, rare earth abrasives reproduced from the retrieved rare earth elements can<br>
be applied to fine polishing process for glass substrates that are used for optical or<br>
magnetic disks, or used for liquid crystal displays such as a thin film transistor-type<br>
(TFT-type) liquid crystal display (LCD) and a twisted nematic-type (TN-type) liquid<br>
crystal display (LCD); a color filter for a liquid crystal television (TV); a cathode ray tube<br>
(CRT) for TV or the like; spectacle lenses; optical lenses; glass substrates for a LSI<br>
photomask; wired plate glass; substrates for a crystal oscillator.<br>
Thus, the present invention, namely the method of recovering rare earth elements<br>
from a composition containing rare earth fluorides, and the method of producing a rare<br>
earth including the steps thereof have high industrial applicability.<br><br>

ABSTRACT<br><br>
METHOD OF RECOVERING RARE EARTH ELEMENT FROM<br>
COMPOSITION CONTAINING RARE EARTH FLUORIDE<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a method of recovering a rare<br>
earth element from a composition containing a rare earth fluoride, involving the steps of:<br>
(1) mixing a composition containing a rare earth fluoride, silicon oxide, and hydrochloric<br>
acid; (2) heating the mixture, thereby dissolving the rare earth fluoride; (3) removing an<br>
insoluble content from the solution obtained at step (2) to obtain a rare earth-containing<br>
solution; and (4) recovering the rare earth element from the rare earth-containing solution<br>
obtained at step (3).</td>
