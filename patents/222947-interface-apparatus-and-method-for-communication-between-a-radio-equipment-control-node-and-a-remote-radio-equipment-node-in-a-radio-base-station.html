GRANTED<br>
30-7-2008<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br>
RELATED APPLICATION<br>
[0001]	This application claims priority from Swedish provisional application<br>
number SE 0302596-2, filed on September 30, 2003, entitled "Common Public Radio Interface," the contents of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002]	The present invention is directed to distributed radio base stations where a<br>
base station includes a main baseband processing unit coupled to one or more remote radio units where RF processing occurs, and in particular, to the radio interface between the main baseband processing unit and the one or more remote radio units.<br>
BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY<br>
[0003]	In a typical cellular radio system, wireless user equipment units (UEs)<br>
communicate via a radio access network (RAN) with one or more core networks. The<br>
user equipment units (UEs) can be mobile stations such as mobile telephones<br>
("cellular" telephones) and laptops with mobile termination, and thus can be, for<br>
example, portable, pocket, hand-held, computer-included, or car-mounted mobile<br>
devices which communicate voice and/or data with radio access network.<br>
Alternatively, the wireless user equipment units can be fixed wireless devices, e.g.,<br>
fixed cellular devices/terminals which are part of a wireless local loop or the like.<br>
[0004]	The radio access network (RAN) covers a geographical area which is<br>
divided into cell areas, with each cell area being served by a radio base station. A cell is a geographical area where radio coverage is provided by the radio equipment at a base station site. Each cell is identified by a unique identity, which is broadcast in the cell. The radio base stations communicate over the air interface with the user<br>
CONFIRMATION COPY<br><br>
equipment units (UE) within range of the base stations. In the radio access network, several base stations are typically connected (e.g., by landline or microwave link) to a control node known as a base station controller (BSC) or a radio network controller (RNC). The control node supervises and coordinates various activities of connected plural radio base stations. The control node is typically connected to one or more core networks.<br>
[0005]	A conventional radio base station in a cellular communications system is<br>
generally located in a single location, and the distance between the baseband circuitry and the radio circuitry is relatively short, e.g., on the order of one meter. A distributed radio base station includes the radio equipment control (REC) and the radio equipment (RE). Both parts may be physically separated, (i.e., the RE may be close to the antenna, whereas the REC is located in a conveniently accessible site), or both may be co-located as in a conventional radio base station design. The radio equipment control (REC) performs baseband signal processing, and each radio equipment (RE) converts between baseband and radio frequencies and transmits and receives signals over one or more antennas. Each RE serves a certain geographic area, sector, or cell. Separate, dedicated optical and/or electrical links connect the radio equipment control (REC) to each of the plural remote radio equipment (RE). However, the term link as used hereafter refers to a logical link and is not limited to any particular physical medium. Each link carries digital information downlink from the REC to the RE and digital information uplink from the RE to the REC.<br>
[0006]	It would be desirable to have a standardized common interface between a<br>
REC and one or more REs.   Such a standardized interface enables flexible and efficient product differentiation for radio base stations and independent technology evolution for the RE and REC. Such a standard would preferably define necessary items for transport, connectivity, and control including user plane data, control and management (C&amp;M) plane transport mechanisms, and synchronization. Standardization would be particularly beneficial for hardware-dependent layers, e.g., physical layers, to ensure<br><br>
technology evolution on both sides of the interface with only a limited need for<br>
hardware adaptation. One advantageous result is that product differentiation in terms of<br>
functionality, management, and characteristics is not limited.<br>
[0007]	Other features that would be desirable to be supported by such an<br>
interface include:<br>
•	Very high bandwidth utilization with the bandwidth supporting as many antenna-carriers as possible.<br>
•	Very low delay (cable delay not included).<br>
•	High-performance with respect to time and frequency distribution.<br>
•	Flexible control and management signaling bandwidth.<br>
•	Plug-and-play startup.<br>
•	Flexible line bit rate<br>
•	Flexible physical interface<br>
[0008]	These features and others are achieved by an interface, apparatus, and<br>
method for communication between a radio equipment control (REC) node and a radio equipment (RE) node in a radio base station that transceives information over the radio interface using multiple antenna-carriers. The REC node is separate from and coupled to the RE node by a transmission link. Both control information and user information are generated for transmission over the transmission link from one of the REC node and the RE node to the other. The user information includes multiple data flows. Each data flow corresponds to data associated with one antenna per one radio carrier. The control and user information are formatted into multiple time division multiplexed (TDM) frames. Each basic TDM frame includes a control time slot for the control information and multiple data time slots for the user information. Each data time slot corresponds to a data flow of one of the antenna carriers. The frames are then transmitted over the transmission link to the other node. In an example implementation in a wideband code division multiple access (CDMA) environment, the time period of the frame corresponds to one CDMA chip time period.<br><br><br>
[0009]	Each antenna carrier has a corresponding time slot in the frame so that the<br>
data samples for each antenna carrier are inserted in the antenna carrier's corresponding time slot. The corresponding time slot position in the frame may be fixed or it may be variable. The control information includes multiple different control flows, and a portion of them is included in the control time slot. The different control flows may include, for example, four control flows: radio interface and timing synchronization information, control and management (C&amp;M) information, layer 1 (LI) control information, and extension information. The control and management information includes both fast and slow control and management information, and the LI signaling indicates the bit rate of both.<br>
[0010]	The control time slots may be arranged into 64 subchannels. Each such<br>
subchannel corresponds to every 64th control time slot. The 64 subchannels may then be allocated to carry the four control flows. Multiple basic frames may be combined into a hyperframe, and multiple hyperframes may be combined into a radio frame. One or more borders of me hyperframe are used to map each control time slot to a respective assigned subchannel. Each of the four control words within a hyperframe carries one subflow of a control flow.<br>
[0011]	The control information includes a known symbol for use in obtaining<br>
synchronization between the REC and the RE. The synchronization includes detecting<br>
the known symbol to retrieve one or more hyperframe borders. The known signal is<br>
periodically provided, and synchronization is obtained without requiring a feedback<br>
signal be sent in response to detecting the known signal. In one, non-limiting example<br>
implementation, the known signal is a K28.5 symbol.<br>
[0012]	Start-up communication between the REC and the RE include<br>
negotiations of one or more characteristics for the transmission link. The negotiations begin with the REC sending transmissions over the interface, with each transmission using one of several different line bit rates. The RE attempts to detect the line bit rate of each such transmission. If the RE detects one of the REC transmissions, then the RE<br><br>
replies to the REC using the same line bit rate. Similarly, one or both of the REC and RE transmit a highest, supported bit rate for one or more control and management flows. The node with the highest control and management bit rate adopts the highest rate supported by the other node. Alternatively, the REC proposes a lower C&amp;M bit rate. A similar back-and-forth negotiation occurs with respect to the highest supported version of the REC-RE interface communications protocol.<br>
[0013]	Another feature includes calibrating or compensating for a transmission<br>
time delay associated with the transmission link/internal interface. More specifically,<br>
the RE obtains an RE time difference between when a frame structure is received from<br>
the REC and when the frame structure is transmitted to the REC. Similarly, the REC<br>
determines an REC time difference between when a frame structure is received from<br>
the RE and when the frame structure is transmitted to the RE. A round-trip delay is<br>
determined by subtracting the RE time difference and the REC time difference.<br>
[0014)	These and other features and advantages are further described in<br>
connection with the figures and the detailed description.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0032]	The following description sets forth specific details, such as particular<br>
embodiments, procedures, techniques, etc., for purposes of explanation and not limitation. But it will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that other embodiments may be employed apart from these specific details. For example, although the following description is facilitated using non-limiting examples, the present invention<br><br><br>
may be employed to in any type of radio communications system where base stations are used. In some instances, (ietailed descriptions of well-known methods, interfaces, circuits, and signaling are omitted s° as not obscure the description with unnecessary detail. Moreover, individual plocks are shown in some of the figures. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the functions of those blocks may be implemented using individual hardware circuits, using software programs and data, in conjunction with a suitably programmed digital microprocessor or general purpose computer, using application specific integrated circuitry (ASIC), and/or using one or more digital signal processors (DSPs).<br>
[0033]	Because of certain data handling limitations of second generation cellular<br>
telecommunication systems, such as GSM, third generation systems were developed to provide high bit rate services that enable, for example, high quality images and video to be transmitted and received and to provide access to the worldwide web with high data rates. These third generation mobile communication systems are referred to as universal mobile telecommunication systems (UMTS). Wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA) if the main third generation access technique used for communications over the radio/air interface. UMTS systems include logical network elements that each have a defined functionality. Figure 1 shows an example UMTS system. Network elements afe grouped into the radio access network (RAN), sometimes as referred to as the UMTS Terrestrial RAN (UTRAN), that handles all radio-related functionality, and the core network (CN) which is responsible for switching and routing calls and data connections to external networks such as PSTN, ISDN, PLMN, and the Internet. The UTRAN covers a graphical area which is divided into cell areas, each cell area being served by a radio base station. A cell is a geographical area where radio coverage is provided by the radio equipment. The user equipment (UE) interfaces the user and the radio/air interface.<br>
[0034]	The following 4escription focuses on the node B which converts the data<br>
flow between the Iub interface and the radio/air interface Uu. The internal interface<br><br><br><br>
within the radio base station which links the REC to one or more REs is referred to<br>
herein as the common public radio interface (CPRI) as shown in Figure 3. Even though<br>
a public interface is envisioned, the CPRI interface could be used as a private interface.<br>
The following description is based on UMTS nomenclature, but is not limited just to<br>
UMTS systems, but instead, may be employed in any distributed radio base station.<br>
[0035]	Figure 2A shows a point-to-point CPRI link between one REC and one<br>
RE. Figure 2B illustrates multiple, point-to-point CPRI links between one REC and RE, and Figure 2C illustrates multiple, point-to-point CPRI links between one REC and several REs. Although Figure 2C shows a "star" topology, other topologies could be used, e.g., the REC and REs could be coupled in a cascade configuration with several REs.<br>
[0036]	The radio equipment control (REC) node provides access to the Radio<br>
Network Controller via the lub interface in a UMTS radio access network, whereas the radio equipment (RE) node serves as the air interface to the user equipment (in the UMTS network the air interface is called the Uu interface). The REC performs the radio functions of the digital baseband domain, whereas the RE performs the analog radio frequency (RF) functions. The functional split allows a generic CPRI interface based on In-phase and Quadrature (IQ) complex data can be defined. Continuing with the non-limiting UMTS example, the REC is concerned with the lub transports, the radio base station control and management, and the digital baseband processing. The RE provides the analog and radio frequency functions such as filtering, modulation, frequency conversion, and amplification. An overview of the functional separation between the REC and RE for the UMTS FDD standard is shown in Table 1.<br>

Table 1<br>
[0037]	In addition to the user plane data (]Q data), control and management<br>
(C&amp;M) control signals as well as synchronization control signals are exchanged<br>
between the REC and the RE. All information streams or "planes", including both<br>
control and user data, are multiplexed onto a digital serial communication line using<br>
layer 1 and layer 2 protocols. See Figure 3. The different information flows have<br>
access to the layer 2 via appropriate service access points (SAPs), as shown in Figure 4.<br>
[0038]	The protocols for the physical layer (layer 1), and the data link layer<br>
(layer 2) are defined by the CPRI. Layer 1 defines electrical characteristics, optical characteristics, time division multiplexing of different data flows, and low level signaling. Layer 2 defines media access control, flow control, and data protection of the controLand management information flow. There are multiple protocol planes or flows. A control plane includes control information used for call processing. A synchronization plane transfers synchronization and timing information between the REC and the RE. A management plane includes management information for the<br><br><br>
operation, administration, and maintenance of the CPRI interface and the RE. The user plane includes user data that  must be transferred from the radio network station to the user equipment and vice versa.<br>
[0039]	The user data are transferred in the form of complex data, referred to<br>
herein as IQ data, where "I" corresponds to the real or In-phase component of the<br>
complex signal and "Q" corresponds to the imaginary or Quadrature component of the<br>
complex signal. Several IQ data flows may be sent via one physical CPRI link, and<br>
each IQ data flow reflects the data of one antenna for one carrier, which is referred to as<br>
an antenna-carrier (AxC). One AxC is associated with the amount of digital user data<br>
for either reception or transmission of one carrier, e.g., a UTRA-FDD carrier at one<br>
independent antenna element- Stated differently, the AxC is the data to be transmitted<br>
on a specific frequency on a specific antenna. Since the CDMA method is used in this<br>
description, each AxC contains the information for multiple UEs superimposed on each<br>
other. In the example embodiment, the AxC "container" or time slot contains the user<br>
data (e.g., IQ samples) of the one AxC for one UMTS chip duration.<br>
[0040]	Layer 2 service access points (SAPs) are defined for the information<br>
planes or data flows and are used as reference points for performance measurements. These service access points shown in Figure 4 are denoted as SAPCM, SAPS, and SAPiQ. The downlink direction is from the REC to RE, and the uplink direction is from the RE to the REC.<br>
[0041]	Figure 5 illustrates an overview of the CPRI protocol for the physical<br>
layer 34 (layer 1) and the data link layer 36 (layer 2). Layer 1 defines, e.g., electrical characteristics, optical characteristics, time division multiplexing of the different data flows, and low level signaling- Layer 2 defines the media access control, flow control, and data protection of the control and management information flow. The control plane involves control data flow used for the user plane control. The RE does not "know" anything about different calls being set up or released. The control plane typically sets the frequency and output power per AxC and reads measurements per AxC. The<br><br><br>
management plane carries management information for the operation, administration, and maintenance of the CPRI link and the radio equipment. The control and management data is exchanged between control and management entities in the radio equipment controller 12 and radio equipment 14 and is provided to higher protocol layers. The control and management plane is mapped to a single control flow over the CPRI link.<br>
[0042]	The user plane includes data to be transferred from the radio base station<br>
to the user equipment and vice versa. As the method above, the user plane IQ data is represented by block 40 in Fig. 5. Several IQ data flows may be sent via one physical CPRI link, and again, each IQ data flow corresponds to the data for one antenna-carrier (AxC).<br>
[0043]	The synchronization plane transfers synchronization and timing<br>
information between radio equipment controller 12 and radio equipment 14.<br>
Synchronization data is used for encoding (e.g., 8B/10B encoding) performed in the<br>
SERDES (Serializer/Deserializer) 76 and 86 shown in Figure 6. The synchronization<br>
data is needed to align the deserializer at the receiving end to the serializer at the<br>
transmitting end.   Synchronization data is also used to detect chip, hyperframe, and<br>
radio frame boundaries, and associated frame numbering as described below. The in¬<br>
band signaling, depicted by block 42 in Fig. 5, includes information that is related to the<br>
physical REC/RE link for system startup, layer 1 link maintenance, and time critical<br>
information that has a direct time relationship to layer 1 user data. Block 44 represents<br>
an information flow reserved for vendoT-specific information.<br>
[0044]	The IQ data of different antenna carriers are multiplexed by a time<br>
division multiplexing (TDM) scheme onto transmission links. The Control and Management (C&amp;M) data are either sent as inband signaling (for time critical signaling data) or by layer 3 protocols that reside on top of appropriate layer 2 protocols. Two different layer 2 protocols - High Data Level Link Control (HDLC) 46 and Ethernet 48 <br><br>
are supported by the CPRI. The control and management data and the synchronization information are time-multiplexed with the IQ data.<br>
[0045]	Figure 6 illustrates the REC and RE nodes in further detail. The REC<br>
node 12 is managed by a controller 70, e.g., a CPU. A framer/deframer unit 72 is<br>
coupled to the controller 70. Each data flow corresponding to the data for one antenna<br>
of one carrier, i.e., one antenna-carrier (AxC), is provided to the framer 72 which<br>
multiplexes all data flows/AxCs, control and management information, synchronization<br>
information and layer one (LI) information into a particular frame structure, which is<br>
described in more detail below. The frame structure for a particular RE is then<br>
provided to a serializer/deserializer unit (SERDES) 76 corresponding to this RE 14, and<br>
the SERDES 76 generates a serial stream on an output port (not shown) corresponding<br>
to that RE 14. Similarly, information from each RE is received on an input port (not<br>
shown), deserialized by SERDES 76, (i.e., put into parallel form), and provided to the<br>
deframer 72. The deframer 72 extracts and distributes to the appropriate SAP, the data<br>
flow, controller management, and layer 1 timing and maintenance information. A local<br>
timing unit 74 provides frequency and time references for the REC 12.<br>
[0046]	The RE 14 has a similar structure and is managed by a controller 80, e.g.,<br>
a CPU. The controller 80 is coupled to a CPRI framer/deframer 82. The framer/deframer is coupled to one or more antenna elements, where each antenna element receives a corresponding data flow. The framer/deframer 82 extracts control and management data and layer 1 maintenance data received from the REC 12 by way of the serializer/deserializer 86 and provides it to the controller 80 over a control link not shown. The framer/deframer 82 also combines control management data, layer 1 data, timing data provided by the local timing unit 84, and data flow information in a frame structure and provides the frame structure to the REC in serial form via the serializer/deserializer 86. The data flow information is received from the analog radio part of the RE 14 for multiplexing into the basic frame structure.<br><br>
[0047]	The REC 12 regularly transmits a "time mark," generated by the REC's<br>
local timing unit 74, over the CPRI links that can be readily detected and recognized by<br>
each RE 14. The time mark at the outgoing or incoming interface port is used to relate<br>
time to a unique carrier instant on the interface. In the example implementation, the<br>
time mark is a K28.5,10-bit symbol that is sent every ten milliseconds by the REC 12.<br>
When the lime .mark is received by the KB 1 4, the RE's JocaJ time unit 84 is set to a<br>
predetermined value, e.g., zero. In this way, the local time unit 84 is synchronized by<br>
"slaving" it to the timing mark generated by the REC's local timing unit 74.<br>
[0048]	The TDMA information is carried over the CPRI interface in frames. In<br>
the non-limiting example implementation, the length of a basic frame illustrated in<br>
Figure 7 is 1 WCDMA chip period-&gt;Tchip = 1/3.84 MHz = 260.416667ns. A basic<br>
frame consists of 16 words with index W=0... 15. The word with the index W=0 is<br>
used as a control word (CW). The remaining words (W=l ...15), 15/16 of the basic<br>
frame are dedicated to the user plane IQ data shown in the figure as the IQ data block.<br>
The word length T depends on the total data rate, which is referred to as the CPRI line<br>
bit rate. Three alternative data rates, each with differing word lengths are available:<br>
614.4 Mbit/s (length of word T=8); 1228.8 Mbit/s (length of word T=16), shown in<br>
Figure 8; and 2457.6 Mbit/s, (length of word T=32) shown in Figure 9.<br>
[0049]	Each word corresponds to an 8-bit byte. Each bit within a word in Fig. 7<br>
can be addressed with the index B, where B=0 is the least significant bit and B=T-1 is the most significant bit. Each bit within a word in Figs. 8 and 9 can be addressed with the index Y, where B=0 is the least significant bit of Y=0, B=7 is the most significant bit of Y=0, B=8 is the least significant bit of Y=l, etc. The transmission sequence of the bits is indicated on the right-hand side of Figures 7 to 9 with each ball representing a bit. After 8B/10B encoding, the ten code groups ("ABCDEI FGHJ") are transmitted as a serial data stream with bit "A" first. In 8B/10B encoding, one encoding bit is added to the three most significant bits, and another encoding bit is added to the five least significant bits.<br><br><br>
[0050]	An AxC container carries an IQ data block in the basic frame. It contains<br>
N IQ samples from the same AxC, where N is the oversampling ratio. IQ sample(s) are sent in an AxC container in accordance with either a "packed position" or a "flexible position" in the basic frame. Both are illustrated in Figure 10. In the packed position, each AxC container in the basic frame is sent consecutively without any reserved bits in between and in descending order of AxC number. For the flexible position, a higher level application decides at what address in the IQ data block the first data bit of the AxC container will be positioned. Bits not used by an AxC container may be treated as reserved bits "r."<br>
[0051]	Figure 11 illustrates a hyperframe structure which is hierarchically<br>
embedded between the basic frame and the UMTs radio frame. "W" represents the<br>
word number in the basic frame, and "Y" represents the byte number within each word.<br>
Again, in this example implementation, the basic frame corresponds to a single chip<br>
period in UMTS. A hyperframe includes 256 basic frames, with the hyperframe<br>
number being designated by the variable X. 256 basic frames in the example<br>
implementation corresponds to 66.67 microseconds. 150 hyperframes are packed into a<br>
single UMTS radio frame, and in the example implementation, the UMTS frame is 10<br>
milliseconds. Each hyperframe number is represented by the variable "Z." The<br>
hyperframe structure is used to multiplex the different control flows (and sub flows<br>
thereof) onto the control time slot. The smallest (in terms of bit rate) specified control<br>
flow is one control time slot per hyperframe. An example of a smallest control flow is<br>
the timing marker of the synchronization alignment flow (e.g., a K28.5 symbol). The<br>
choice of 256 basic frames as one hyperframe provides fine granularity in the allocation<br>
of bandwidth to different control flows and also simplifies implementation.<br>
[0052]	The data control information are multiplexed together in the basic frame.<br>
Figure 12 illustrates how multiple antenna carriers AxC l...AxC N, each having multiple user data (IQ) samples U|, U2, ..., etc. , are multiplexed with a series of control words (CW) at a first multiplexing level 1. In turn, each control word<br><br>
corresponds to various control information which has been multiplexed onto the control<br>
word stream at a second multiplexing level 2. The control information includes timing,<br>
layer 1 (Ll) signaling, C&amp;M information, and extension information. This corresponds<br>
to the logical multiplexing of the different control flows shown in Figure 5. Still<br>
further, the different timing information and different layer 1 signaling may be<br>
multiplexed at a third level 3. This corresponds to a logical multiplexing of the<br>
different information within the SYNC and Ll inband signaling 42 shown in Figure 5.<br>
Multiplexing of different applications onto the C&amp;M plane is not shown in Figure 12.<br>
[0053]	To clearly define the multiplexers in Figure 12, the control words (CW)<br>
are preferably organized into subchannels. The level 2 multiplexer operates on the<br>
subchannels, and each of the four inputs allocates one or more subchannels. In the<br>
example implementation, 64 subchannels are defined. Each subchannel includes every<br>
64th control word (CW). The first CW in a hyperframe belongs to subchannel 0. Each<br>
subchannel has 4 CWs within a hyperframe (CWO - CW3). Subchannel 0 has a CW in<br>
basic frame numbers 0, 64, 128 and 192 within the hyperframe. Subchannel 63 has a<br>
CW in basic frame numbers 63, 127, 191 and 255 within the hyperframe.<br>
[0054]	This CW organization of a hyperframe is shown in Figure 13. The index<br>
for the subchannels ranges from 0 to 63. The index (Xs) of a control word within a<br>
subchannel has four possible values—0,1, 2, and 3. The index of the control word<br>
within a hyperframe is given by the following equation: X=Ns +64* Xs, where Ns is<br>
the word number in the hyperframe. The level 3 multiplexer of Figure 12 works on the<br>
CW level multiplexing up to four sub flows onto one subchannel. The sub flows can be<br>
allocated in increments of one CW per hyperframe. Also, the level 3 multiplexer is<br>
aligned with the hyperframe start to simplify demultiplexing at the receiving end.<br>
[0055]	The organization of the control words in subchannels is illustrated in<br>
Figures 13 and 14. In Figure 13, it is clearthat the synchronization time mark, referred to in Figure 13 as a sync byte, corresponds to the first control word/subchannel CWO at Xs = 0 and Ns = 0. As described above, the synchronization and timing between the<br><br><br>
REC and the RE are achieved by the RE detecting the sync time mark contained in this control word. The time mark at the beginning of every hyperframe may be a unique but known symbol (an example is described below). Subchannel 1 includes the slow C&amp;M link, where the slow C&amp;M link is based on HDLC and has a bandwidth of 0.24, 0.48, or 0.96 Mbps at 1228.8 line bit rate. The slow C&amp;M link includes HDLC frames carrying protocol layer L2+ messages. Subchannel 2 includes layer 1 in-band protocol information including the interface version, the slow C&amp;M link bit rate (if present), LI control (e.g., reset of RE, SAP usage, etc.), the LI status (signal presence and quality, end-point fault, etc.). The last control word of subchannel 2 includes a pointer "p" which points to the address/index of the start of fast C&amp;M link, which in this example, is a subchannel number, somewhere in the range between 18 and 61. The slow C&amp;M link includes Ethernet frames carrying L2+ messages. The fast C&amp;M which uses Ethernet has a bandwidth of 0.96 mbps * N at 1.22.8 line bit rate, where N is the number of subchannels allocated. Subchannels 3-15 are reserved for frame or other uses, and subchannels 16 up through the pointer subchannel for the fast C&amp;M include vendor-specific information. The vendor specific subchannels allow for add-ons to the protocol to achieve product differentiation. In addition to the sync byte, subchannel 0 also carries the hyperframe number (HFN in CW 1) and the node B Frame Number (BFN in CW 2 and CW3). The BFN identifies a radio frame in the radio signal sent over the air interface.<br>
[0056]	Figure 14 illustrates control words and subchannels within one<br>
hyperframe. The BFN changes every 150 hyperframes/one radio frame. To quickly synchronize to the radio BFN frame structure, the hyperframe number (HFN) is transferred over the radio Uu interface. The RE can determine the radio interface (e.g., Uu) frame structure after receiving one hyper frame. The current BFN is transferred in whole, and the offset within the radio frame at the start of the received hyperframe is [HFN (received)/!50] of a radio frame.<br><br><br>
[0057]	The LI signaling transfers a Service access point Defect Indicator (SDI)<br>
bit or the like. The SDI bit indicates that higher protocol layers (L3 and above) are<br>
available and operational on the C&amp;M link, synchronization link, and IQ data link. If<br>
the transmitting TDM framer in either the REC or the RE detects that at least one of the<br>
links is missing (a fault scenario), the SDI bit is set. Upon detecting a SDI bit, the<br>
receiving node stops interpreting the C&amp;M, the synchronization, and IQ links and<br>
enters a "safe state." The fast signaling of a defective link is important because a faulty<br>
IQ link or synchronization link may cause transmission of radio signals that do not<br>
comply with regulatory requirements. A faulty C&amp;M link may further hinder<br>
reconfiguration which in turn can also break such regulatory requirements. Of course,<br>
other indicators may be sent to accomplish one or more of these functions.<br>
[0058]	The TDM structure requires that both the transmitting node REC/RE and<br>
the RE/REC receiving node correctly know when a hyperframe starts. As a result, the receiving node must be able to detect the first basic frame of a hyperframe, the first octet or byte of the first basic frame, and the first bit of the first byte. All three synchronization levels are achieved by sending a unique, known symbol as the first word in a hyperframe. One example is a K28.5 symbol which is an 8B/10B code having a total of 10 bits. Two of those bits are redundant bits used for error detection and/or correction. Of course, other known symbols could be used. One-fourth of the control subchannel 0, namely, the first control word X0 may be used to transfer the K28.5 symbol to reduce complexity. Using the K28.5 symbol, the RE achieves clock and data recovery. By initially transmitting the K28.5 symbol, the REC defines word borders in the hyperframe. If the receiving node loses data recovery during operation, additional K28.5 symbols are transferred. As a result, the CPRI interface is self-synchronizing on all levels without the need for feedback from the RE of clock and data recovery status. Nor are special actions needed to regain synchronization other than normal operation of the interface.<br><br><br><br>
[0059]	The start-up of the CPRI interface requires minimal start-up information<br>
at both the REC and RE nodes, i.e., start-up is plug-and-play. This is particularly desirable when radio base stations are deployed in large numbers. The start-up procedure must accomplish LI synchronization bit alignment and hyperframe alignment.   During start-up, the REC and the RE negotiate 3 interface characteristics: the line bit rate of the interface, the protocol revision, and the C&amp;M link characteristics. Since there is no mandatory line bit rate or C&amp;M link characteristics, the REC and RE must, during the start-up procedure, try different configurations until a common match is detected. The common match does not have to be optimal. Instead, the first common match permits an exchange of capabilities of a proper configuration to be used in the following communications.<br>
[0060]	Figure 15 illustrates start-up state diagram showing various start-up states<br>
and transitions. During the stand-by state, there is no transmission or reception over the CPRI. An operator may designate a suitable start-up configuration including line bit rate, C&amp;M link characteristics, etc. The REC and the RE may also have knowledge about a previous successful configuration. In state B, called "LI synchronization, and rate negotiation," both REC and RE reach layer 1 (LI) synchronization, and the line bit rate of the interface is determined. The REC starts to transmit over the CPRI at the highest available bit rate when first entering the LI synchronization state and also attempts to receive over the CPRI from the RE at the same line bit rate. If the REC does not reach synchronization, (i.e., the REC does not receive (1) K28.5 symbols at the proper repetition rate—1 per hyperframe—along with (2) an incrementing HFN), it selects another line bit rate after a time interval Tl, where the time interval Tl may be, for example, 0.9-1.1 seconds. Following each Tl interval, a new line bit rate for reception and transmission is selected, assuming that one is available. The line bit rates may be selected from the available set in a round robin fashion, i.e., the first highest, the second highest,..., the slowest, and restarting from the highest line bit rate.<br><br><br>
[0061]	The RE attempts to receive over the CPRI at the highest available line bit<br>
rate when first entering the LI synchronization state. If the RE does not each synchronization, (i.e., the REC does not receive K28.5 symbols at the proper repetition rate—1 per hyperframe—along with an incrementing HFN), it selects another line bit rate after a Tl', where Tl' may be, for example, between 3.9-4.1 seconds. Following each Tl' interval, a new reception line bit rate selected for reception assuming that one is available. Again, the line bit rates may be selected from the available set in a round robin fashion. When the RE reaches synchronization, it starts to transmit over the CPRl interface to the REC at the same line bit rate that it successfully received at. At this point, layer 1 is synchronized with both uplink and downlink hyperframe structures aligned.<br>
[0062]	After successful completion of LI synchronization and line bit rate<br>
negotiation, the next start-up state is protocol setup. During this state, a common<br>
protocol version of CPRI is determined. If one or both of the REC and RE can use<br>
multiple revisions of the CPRI interface, a common revision must be found before<br>
trying to extract the conveyed C&amp;M link. Otherwise, the layer 1 signaling (and thus<br>
information about possible C&amp;M links) cannot be interpreted. The REC and RE<br>
negotiate as follows: each node proposes the highest protocol revision that it supports.<br>
The node with the proposed highest revision steps back to the same revision as the<br>
other node (if possible) or proposes another revision, lower than the other node's (if<br>
possible). If one node proposes a revision lower than the lowest revision supported by<br>
the other node, no common protocol is available, and the start-up fails. If both nodes<br>
propose the same revision, the start-up proceeds using that proposed protocol revision.<br>
[0063]	After layer 1 synchronization and protocol version agreement, the start-up<br>
moves to state C&amp;M plane (L2+) setup to determine a common C&amp;M link bit rate. Negotiations proceed in parallel for the fast C&amp;M link and the slow C&amp;M link. For both links, each node proposes the fastest possible bit rate it supports, i.e., the fastest bit rate supported for fast C&amp;M and the fastest bit rate supported for slow C&amp;M. The unit<br><br><br><br>
with the highest proposed bit rate steps back to the bit rate proposed by the other node (if possible) or proposes another bit rate lower than that proposed by the other node (if possible). Of course, if no common C&amp;M fast and slow bit rates are found, the start-up fails. If neither the fast or slow C&amp;M link is set-up, the CPRI interface is a "passive link," which can be used in parallel with another interface with has a C&amp;M link, e.g., when the C&amp;M carrying interface does not have enough space for all AxCs to be transferred. The passive link state is shown in Figure 15.<br>
[0064]	If the fast and slow C&amp;M link speeds are agreed, the start-up proceeds to<br>
a vendor-specific negotiation state. During this state, the higher level applications in the REC and RE negotiate the CPRI usage. This specific information exchange about capabilities and capability limitations results in a preferred configuration of the CPRI based on a vendor-specific requirements. At this point, the start-up is complete and normal operation commences.<br>
[0065]	Related to synchronization is the issue of calibration/compensation for<br>
delays associated with the CPRI interface. The CPRI provides a mechanism to<br>
calibrate the delay between the REC and RE. Specific reference points for delay<br>
calibration and timing relationships between input and output signals at the REC and<br>
RE are defined as shown in Figure 16. Reference points R1-R4 correspond to the<br>
output point of the REC (Rl), the input of RE (R2), the output point of RE (R3), and<br>
the input point of REC (R4), respectively. The antenna is shown as "Ra" for reference.<br>
[0066]	Figure 17 shows the relationship between downlink and uplink frame<br>
timing. T12 is the delay of the downlink signal from the output point of REC (Rl) to the input point RE (R2). T34 is the delay of the uplink signal from the RE output point (R3) to the REC input (R4). Toffset is the frame offset between the RE input at R2 and<br>
the RE output signal at R3. T14 is the frame timing difference (the round trip delay),   	<br>
between the output signal at Rl and the input signal at R4.<br>
[0067]	The RE determines the frame timing of its output signal (uplink) to the<br>
fixed offset (Toffset) relative to the frame timing of its input signal (the downlink signal <br><br>
from REC). This fixed offset (Toffset) is an arbitrary value which is greater than or<br>
equal to 0 and less than 256*TC. Different REs may use different values for Toffset. In<br>
that case, the REC should know the Toffset value for each in advance, (e.g., a<br>
predefined value or RE informs REC by higher layer message). In addition, the<br>
downlink BFN and HFN from the REC to the RE are sent back uplink by the RE to the<br>
REC to remove ambiguity if  the delay (TI2 + T34) is more than one hyperframe.<br>
[0068]	Assuming the CPRI interface delay in the uplink and downlink direction<br>
are equal, the interface delay can be determined by each node measuring the difference Toffset between the transmitted and received hyperframe structure. The RE reports the difference Toffset to the REC as Toffset RE. The round-trip delay can be calculated as follows: round-trip delay =Toffset REC-Toffset RE. The one-way delay is approximately one-half the round-trip delay. To simplify the delay measurement of long cables, (e.g., delay &gt; one hyperframe/2), the RE generates its transmitted hyperframe number based on the received hyperframe number. The Toffset RE is therefore between 0 and 1 hyperframes long.<br>
[0069]	The invention can be practiced in a wide variety of implementations and<br>
embodiments, and is not limited to the CPRI example described above. Further details of this particular CPRI example implementation are provided in the CPRI specification v.l .0 (2003-09-30) described in the Swedish priority application, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
