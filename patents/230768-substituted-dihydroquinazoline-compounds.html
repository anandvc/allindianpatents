				<td>The invention relates to substituted dihydroquinazolines and to processes for their preparation and also to their use for preparing medicaments for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of diseases, in particular for use as antiviral agents, in particular against cytomegalo viruses.<br>
The synthesis of dihydroquinazolines is described in Saito T., et al. Tetrahedron Lett., 1996, 37, 209-212 and in Wang F., et al. Tetrahedron Lett., 1997, 38, 8651-8654.<br>
Although agents with antiviral activity and a different structure are available on the market, it is always possible for resistance to develop. Novel agents for an effective therapy are therefore desirable.<br>
One object of the present invention is therefore to provide novel compounds having the same or improved antiviral effect for the treatment of viral infective diseases in humans and animals.<br>
It has been found, surprisingly, that the substituted dihydroquinazolines described in the present invention have antiviral effect.<br>
The present invention provides compounds of the formula<br><br><br>

General procedure [G]: Reaction of the iminophosphorane with an isocyanate and subsequent reaction with an amine to give the dihydroquinazoline derivative<br>
1.0 equivalent of the iminophosphorane is dissolved in 20ml of dichloromethane (0.1-0.2M solution). 1.05 equivalents of a substituted isocyanate are then added, and the mixture is stirred at RT until the reaction has ended. The reaction is monitored by TLC or by analytical HPLC.<br>
1.0 equivalent of amine and a spatula tip of silica gel are then added to the resulting solution of the carbodiimide and dichloromethane, and the mixture is stirred at room temperature until the reaction has gone to completion. After the reaction has ended (reaction is monitored by TLC or HPLC), the mixture is concentrated and purified by preparative HPLC on an RP phase.<br>
In certain cases, the NMR shows the presence of a varying proportion of non-cyclized reaction product. In those cases, the mixture of cyclized and non-cyclized product is taken up in dioxane, a spatula tip of silica gel is added and the mixture is stirred under reflux for 30 min to 16 h. The silica gel is filtered off and the solution is used for further reactions.<br>
If it is intended to produce enantiomericaHy pure compounds, the chromatographic separation is carried out at this stage.<br>

General procedure [HI: Hydrolysis of the quinazolylacetic acid esters<br>
1.0 equivalent of the quinazolyl ester are dissolved in dioxane, and 5.0 equivalents of IN aqueous sodium hydroxide solution are added. The mixture is stirred at 80°C for 16 hours, and after the reaction has ended (the reaction is monitored by analytical HPLC) the mixture is concentrated. The residue is then taken up in water and adjusted to pH 5 using IN hydrochloric acid. The resulting precipitate is filtered off, washed with a little water and diethyl ether and dried at room temperature under high vacuum. Alternatively, the precipitate can be filtered off through an Extrelute cartridge, then washed with ethyl acetate, followed by concentration of the filtrate. If the purity of the product is not high enough, the product is purified either by preparative HPLC on an RP phase (Method 2 or Method 5) or on silica gel using mixtures of cyclohexane/ethyl acetate.<br>

After addition of in each case 2 µl of the 50, 5, 0.5 and 0.05 mM DMSO stock solutions to 98 µl portions of cell culture medium in row 2 A-H for duplicate determinations, 1 :2 dilutions are carried out with 50µl portions of medium up to row 11 of the 96-well plate. The wells in rows 1 and 12 each contain 50 µl of medium. In 150 µl of a suspension of 1 x 104 cells (human prepuce fibroblasts [NHDF]) are pipetted into each of the wells (row 1 = cell control) and, in rows 2-12, a mixture of HCMV-infected and uninfected NHDF cells (M.O.I = 0.001 - 0.002), i.e. 1-2 infected cells per 1000 uninfected cells. Row 12 (without substance) serves as virus control. The final test concentrations are 250-0.0005 µM. The plates are incubated at 37°C/5% CO2 for 6 days, i.e. until all the cells are infected in the virus controls (100% cytopathogenic effect [CPE]). The wells are then fixed and stained by adding a mixture of formalin and Giemsa's dye (30 minutes), washed with double-distilled water and dried in a drying oven at 50°C. The plates are then assessed visually using an overhead microscope (Plaque Multiplier from Technomara).<br>
The following data can be acquired from the test plates:<br>
(NHDF) = substance concentration in µM at which no visible cytostatic effects on the cells are evident by comparison with the untreated cell control;*<br>
EC50 (HCMV) = substance concentration in µM which inhibits the CPE (cytopathic effect) by 50% compared with the untreated virus control;<br>
SI (selectivity index) = CC50 (NHDF) / EC50 (HCMV).<br>
Representative in vitro data for the effects of the compounds of the invention are shown in Table A:<br>

(Table Removed)<br>
The suitability of the compounds of the invention for the treatment of HCMV infections can be shown in the following animal model:<br>
HCMV Xenograft Gelfoam® model<br>
Animals:<br>
3-4-week old female immunodeficient mice (16-18 g), Fox Chase SCID or Fox Chase SCID-NOD or SCID beige, are purchased from commercial breeders (Taconic M+B, Jackson USA). The animals are housed under sterile conditions (including bedding and feed) in isolators.<br>
Virus growing: "<br>
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), Davis or AD 169 strain, is grown in vitro on human embryonic prepuce fibroblasts (NHDF cells). After the NHDF cells have been infected with a multiplicity of infection (M.O.I.) of 0.01-0.03, the virus-infected cells are harvested 5-10 days later and stored in the presence of minimal essential medium (MEM), 10% fetal calf serum (PCS) with 10% DMSO at -40°C. After serial ten-fold dilutions of the virus-<br>
.infected cells, the titer is determined on 24-well plates of confluent NHDF cells after vital staining with Neutral Red.<br>
Preparation of the sponges, transplantation, treatment and evaluation:<br>
Collagen sponges 1xlxl cm in size (Gelfoam®; from Peasel &amp; Lorey, order No. 407534; K.T. Chong et al., Abstracts of 39th 1nterscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, 1999, p. 439) are initially wetted with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the trapped air bubbles are removed by degassing, and then stored in MEM + 10% PCS. lx 106 virus-infected NHDF cells (infection with HCMV Davis or HCMV AD 169 M.O.I. = 0.01) are detached 3 hours after infection and added in a drop of 20 µl of MEM, 10% of PCS, to a moist sponge. About 16 hours later, the infected sponges are incubated with 25 µ1 of PBS / 0.1% BSA / 1 mM DTT with 5 ng/µl basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). For the transplantation, the immunodeficient mice are anaesthetized with Avertin or a ketamine/xylazine/azepromazine mixture, the fur on the back is removed using a shaver, the epidermis is opened 1-2 cm, unstressed and the moist sponges are transplanted under the dorsal skin. The surgical wound is closed with tissue glue. 6 hours after the transplantation, the mice can be treated for the first time (on the day of the operation, there is one treatment). The next days, over a period of 8 days, the mice are treated with substance orally three times a day (7.00 h and 14.00 h and 19.00 h), two times a day (8.00 h and 18.00 h) or once a day (14.00 h). The daily dose is, for example 3 or 10 or 30 or 60 or lOOmg/kg of body weight, the volume administered is 10 ml/kg of body weight. The substances are formulated in the form of a 0.5% strength Tylose suspension with 2% DMSO or a 0.5% strength Tylose suspension. 9 days after transplantation and 16 hours<br><br>
after the last administration of substance, the animals are painlessly sacrificed and the sponge is removed. The virus-infected cells are released from the sponge by collagenase digestion (330 U/1.5 ml) and stored in the presence of MEM, 10% fetal calf serum, 10% DMSO at -140°C. Evaluation takes place after serial ten-fold dilutions of the virus-infected cells by determining the titer on 24-well plates of confluent NHDF cells after vital staining with Neutral Red. The number of infected cells or infectious virus particles (infectious centre assay) after the substance treatment compared with the placebo-treated control is determined.<br>
CYP inhibition assay<br>
To investigate the mechanism-based (irreversible) inhibition of CYP3A4, different concentrations of the test substance are incubated with human liver microsomes (2 mg/ml of microsomal protein) in potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 with addition of an NADPH-generating system (NADP+, glucose 6-phosphate, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase) at 37°C. At various points of time, 2 aliquots are taken from the incubation.<br>
The first aliquot is incubated 1:50 in a new incubation solution (phosphate buffer, NADPH-generating system and 10 µM of Midazolam) at 37°C for a further l0 min. The incubation is then stopped using acetonitrile on ice, the protein is pelleted in a centrifuge at 15 000 g and the supernatant is analysed for formation of r-hydroxyimidazolam using standard HPLC/MS methods.<br>
The second aliquot is stopped using acetonitrile on ice and analysed for remaining test substance using HPLC/UV/MS.<br>
The two sets of analytical data are determined for irreversible-inhibition-typical parameters (kmact, KJ and partition ratio r), and using these data, the test substance is evaluated (cf. A. Madan, et al., in A.D. Rodrigues (ed.) "Drug-Drug Interaction" in "Drugs and the Pharmaceutical Science", Vol. 116, ISBN 0-8247-0283.2, Marcel Dekker Inc., New York, 2002.).<br>
