				<td>Description<br>
Electrical shielding arrangement<br>
The invention relates to an electrical shielding arrangement of<br>
a high-voltage line having a first coupling element and at<br>
least one second corresponding coupling element, wherein the<br>
coupling elements can be pushed into one another and has in<br>
each case a tubular control electrode around a line<br>
leadthrough, and the tubular control electrodes are in each<br>
case sheathed by at least one tubular insulating barrier aind<br>
are connected to it.<br>
At the same time, the subject matter of	the present invention<br>
is a coupling element for an electrical	shielding arrangement<br>
for a high-voltage line having a tubular	control electrode and<br>
a tubular insulating barrier.<br>
The electrical connection of electrical installations,<br>
particularly high-voltage installations, requires a high<br>
technical expenditure for the electrical shielding of the<br>
incoming and outgoing voltage lines. In the case of lead-outs<br>
and lead-throughs to electrical installations, in particular,<br>
electrical shielding must be given at all times and over the<br>
Antire line route. In particular in cases in which the<br>
electrical installation is an oil-filled transformer or a choke<br>
coil for high operating voltages, respectively, the line route<br>
is arranged in a grounded and oil-containing dome of the<br>
corresponding electrical installation.<br>
Electrical shielding of the line leadthrough is indispensible<br>
especially for high direct voltages as occur in the case of<br>
high-voltage direct-current transmissions.<br><br>
If it is necessary to compensate for length between two<br>
connecting pieces, so-called disconnect points consisting of<br>
two displaceable, paper-insulated control electrodes can be<br>
located in the leadthroughs of these electrical installations.<br>
In addition, these disconnect points are preferably equipped<br>
with a barrier system enclosing the control electrode, in which<br>
an insulating fluid, particularly an oil, circulates and thus<br>
supports the insulating shielding effect.<br>
At present, disconnect points are known in which the<br>
corresponding control electrodes can be pushed into one<br>
another. In this arrangement, it is problematic, however, that<br>
the barriers are designed in such a manner that additional<br>
elements are integrated at the barriers for locking purposes.<br>
In particular, wedge-shaped enlargements and similar geometric<br>
elements are adapted to the electrical requirements and are<br>
used at the same time for wedging the mostly two-part barrier<br>
system past the disconnect point. Furthermore, a first coupling<br>
piece of the disconnect point is conventionally equipped with a<br>
lesser diameter than the corresponding second coupling element.<br>
The altered diameter in connection with additional elements of<br>
the barrier system located directly on the control electrode<br>
results in a wedging of the coupling elements pushed into one<br>
another. However, it is problematic that the coupling elements<br>
are locked only in precisely one position so that the coupling<br>
elements must be matched precisely to one another with respect<br>
to the locking point. Axial excessive or insufficient lengths<br>
of the lines can therefore be compensated only partially or not<br>
at all with the conventional technology via the coupling<br>
elements in the disconnect point.<br><br>
Thus, DE 690 24 335 T2 describes a socket for high direct<br>
voltages. According to this invention, a capacitive control of<br>
the electrical field is achieved by means of a capacitor body<br>
arranged around the disconnect point. In this arrangement, a<br>
position is defined in the axial direction with respect to the<br>
line leadthrough, which is constructed as a type of straight,<br>
outward-pointing truncated cone, is defined in dependence on<br>
the radii of the capacitor body which are arranged within one<br>
another.<br>
Furthermore, DE 690 12 258 T2 discloses an inside capacitor<br>
wall for controlling the field of the line connection of a<br>
transformer leadthrough. According to this invention, the<br>
capacitor insulating wall prevents an arc-over of the<br>
electrical voltage, in which this barrier is suitable for<br>
capacitively and resistively controlling the electrical field<br>
and is dimensioned in such a manner that the voltages and field<br>
strengths occurring in the respective area do not lead to a<br>
destruction of the barriers.<br>
Furthermore, EP 0 169 922 B1 discloses an insulating element<br>
for high-voltage devices. According to this invention, an<br>
insulating cylinder is reduced with respect to its wall<br>
thickness and chamfered in an area of overlap so that a<br>
corresponding insulating cylinder with corresponding reduction<br>
in the wall thickness and chamfering in the area of overlap is<br>
used in the area of overlap.<br>
The disadvantageous factor in all solutions of the prior art is<br>
that a mechanical tensioning of the barriers into one another<br>
does not allow any or only slight tolerances with respect to<br>
the locking point of the coupling elements against one another.<br>
Due to the position of the tilting elements in the barrier<br>
system and due to the chamfering of corresponding barriers,<br><br>
respectively, it is not possible to freely select the axial<br>
distance between the barriers,<br><br>
and thus also the control electrodes, within a certain range.<br>
However, this is necessary if, when subsequently two lines are<br>
connected, no complete accuracy of fit is given here and<br>
inasmuch as this disconnect point is also used for compensating<br>
for the corresponding shielding elements arranged around the<br>
disconnect point.<br>
It is thus the object of the present invention to avoid the<br>
abovementioned disadvantages of the prior art and to provide a<br>
shielding which can be rapidly and simply produced and<br>
guarantees great tolerance with respect to the coupling<br>
elements relative to one another. At; the same time, the two<br>
line routes should be pluggable.<br>
The object is achieved by the characterizing features of patent<br>
claim 1. According to the invention, it is provided that in an<br>
area of overlap, at least one tubular insulating barrier is not<br>
mechanically connected to the respective control electrode and<br>
the tubular control electrode and the tubular insulating<br>
barrier have a variable diameter compared with the diameter<br>
outside the area of overlap, the diameters of the tubular<br>
insulating barriers of the two coupling elements being matched<br>
to one another in such a manner that the tubular insulating<br>
barriers overlap when they are pushed into one another and<br>
mechanically tension one another. Due to the decoupling of at<br>
least one barrier from the control electrode of a coupling<br>
element in the area of overlap, mechanical strength can be<br>
guaranteed by means of the barrier, taking into consideration<br>
the insulating characteristics. At the same time, this enables<br>
the basic diameters of the line route, of the control<br>
electrodes and of the barriers to remain identical in the outer<br>
area of the respective shielding arrangements and to this<br>
extent the expenditure of<br><br>
producing control electrodes, and barriers sheathing them, with<br>
different diameters is lacking. Furthermore, this ensures that<br>
with a circulation of a circulation medium between the barrier<br>
and the tubular control electrode, the insulation medium is<br>
here used as additional insulation and for electrical field<br>
guidance. The aim of the shielding arrangement according to the<br>
invention is to achieve a resistive control of the electrical<br>
direct-voltage field by the shape of the electrodes, the shape<br>
and thickness of the insulation material and the arrangement<br>
and thickness of the barriers which meet the electrical<br>
dimensioning parameters such as maximum direct-voltage field<br>
strengths and permissible electrical tangential field<br>
strengths.<br>
Tubular in the sense of the invention means that the elements<br>
thus correspondingly designated have a longitudinal extent and<br>
are constructed over an almost circular cross section. In this<br>
arrangement, however, the element in each case designated in<br>
this way does not need to be completely constructed as a type<br>
of tube but can also have openings and partial openings segment<br>
by segment. The definition "circular" also includes cross<br>
sections deviating from this such as, e.g. elliptical,<br>
triangular or multi-angular structures.<br>
The number of coupling elements at a disconnect point is not<br>
limited. Thus, three or four coupling elements can also be<br>
combined in each case to form one connecting point. The<br>
necessary adaptations of the barriers and control electrodes<br>
for a corresponding pushing into one another and tensioning in<br>
a four-element shielding arrangement are then possible by means<br>
of suitable additional elements such as, e.g. L-shaped elements<br>
on the barriers and control electrodes for coupling elements in<br>
each case arranged at right angles to one another.<br><br>
In an advantageous embodiment, the tubular insulating barriers<br>
are constructed to be almost parallel to the direction of<br>
displacement of the coupling elements with respect to the line<br>
route in the area of overlap. This ensures that when the<br>
coupling elements are pushed into one another, the barriers<br>
extending parallel to the line route and pushed into one<br>
another are simultaneously pushed into one another and can be<br>
tensioned with respect to one another.<br>
The tubular insulating barriers are advantageously constructed<br>
in the area of overlap. The stepped construction of the<br>
barriers in the area of overlap ensures that, on the one hand,<br>
great mechanical stability with respect to the barriers lying<br>
outside the area of overlap is given. At the same time, this<br>
provides a parallel alignment of the end area of the barriers<br>
in the area of overlap.<br>
The tubular insulating barriers advantageously consist at least<br>
partially of pressboard.<br>
The tubular insulating barriers of the respective coupling<br>
elements are advantageously constructed as barrier system in<br>
the area of overlap, wherein the individual barriers of the<br>
coupling elements at least partially overlap and/or<br>
mechanically tension one another, and an insulating fluid,<br>
particularly an oil, can be circulated within the barrier<br>
system. This ensures that the field guidance is guaranteed also<br>
in the areas away from the line by means of a multi-step<br>
barrier system. The use of pressboard and of the corresponding<br>
partial overlap of the individual components of the barrier<br>
system with respect to one another, in particular, ensures that<br>
the flow of the insulating fluid, particularly of an insulating<br>
oil,<br><br>
remains ensured within the ducts thus formed.<br>
The control electrode advantageously has an insulation,<br>
preferably of paper, the insulation, in particular, being<br>
arranged between the tubular control electrode and the<br>
respective tubular insulating barrier.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment, the tubular insulating barriers,<br>
pushed into one another, of the coupling elements overlap by up<br>
to 500 mm, preferably 10 mm. In the case of high-voltage<br>
direct-current transmissions, in particular, a large area of<br>
overlap is of advantage for the electrical resistive field<br>
guidance.<br>
The object is also achieved by the characterizing features of<br>
claim 9. In this context, it is provided that the tubular<br>
insulating barrier is not connected to the tubular control<br>
electrode in a coupling area of the coupling element and has a<br>
reduced diameter, compared with the diameter outside the<br>
coupling area. These measures ensure that no different tube<br>
diameters are necessary for the control electrodes or the<br>
barriers, respectively. At the same time, this provides a<br>
possibility of connecting the barrier as a mechanical coupling<br>
element in conjunction with the insulating characteristics.<br>
The coupling area of a coupling element in the sense of the<br>
present invention is smaller than the area of overlap of the<br>
shielding arrangement, the coupling area being approximately<br>
half as long as the area of overlap in a first approximation.<br><br>
Furthermore, it is provided according to the invention that the<br>
tubular insulating barrier has a mechanical strength in the<br>
coupling area and/or consists at least partially of pressboard.<br>
According to the invention, the coupling element is constructed<br>
in such a manner that the tubular control electrode and/or the<br>
tubular insulating barrier are constructed to be stepped and,<br>
in particular, are aligned in parallel with the longitudinal<br>
extent of the line leadthrough.<br>
According to the invention, it is provided that the tubular<br>
insulating barrier is constructed as a barrier system which is<br>
surrounding at least in the coupling area. In an advantageous<br>
embodiment, the tubular insulating barrier is mechanically<br>
reinforced in the longitudinal direction at least in the<br>
coupling area. The reinforcement can be produced by wrapping<br>
the insulating barrier with a strengthening tape in the<br>
coupling area and by applying additional materials and/or by<br>
impregnation by means of a resin.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment, the tubular control electrode<br>
and the tubular insulating barrier has a reduced diameter in<br>
the coupling area compared with the diameter in the outside<br>
area, the diameter of the tubular insulating barrier being<br>
greater in the coupling area than the diameter of the tubular<br>
control electrode. This ensures that the barrier surrounds the<br>
control electrode with respect to the line leadthrough.<br>
Other advantageous embodiments are obtained from the subclaims.<br>
Some exemplary embodiments are explained by means of the<br>
figures, in which:<br><br>
fig. 1 shows a diagrammatic side view of the electrical<br>
shielding arrangement according to the<br>
invention;<br>
fig. 2a, 2b show a diagrammatic view of the electrical<br>
shielding arrangements according to the<br>
invention for two states during the pushing<br>
together of the coupling elements;<br>
fig. 3 shows a diagrammatic view of an electrical<br>
shielding arrangement according to the invention<br>
as disconnect point between two windings.<br>
The figure fig. 1 shows an electrical shielding arrangement 1<br>
according to the invention in which the coupling elements 2a,<br>
2b are pushed into one another. The control electrode 4a of the<br>
first coupling element 2a has a small radial distance compared<br>
with the control electrode 4b of the second coupling element<br>
2b. The control electrodes 4a, 4b have an insulation layer 10.<br>
In the area of overlap, both insulating barriers 6a, 6b have a<br>
different diameter than the control electrodes 4a, 4b. At the<br>
same time, at least one control electrode 4a is not connected<br>
mechanically to the associated barrier 6a. This results in the<br>
advantage that the tubular barrier 6a in the area of overlap 7,<br>
apart from the insulating and control characteristics of the<br>
electrical field, is also used for mechanically tensioning the<br>
respective coupling elements 2a, 2b. The line leadthrough 11 is<br>
located in the center of the drawing. The diagrammatic side<br>
view represents a rotationally symmetric representation of the<br>
shielding arrangement 1 according to the invention. In<br>
deviation from this, the tubular control electrode 4a and/or<br>
the tubular insulating barrier 6a can also have openings and<br>
partial openings so that no complete<br><br>
rotational symmetry of the drawing fig. 1 and of the subsequent<br>
figures fig. 2a and 2b can exist.<br>
The figures fig. 2a and 2b show two different tensioning states<br>
of the shielding arrangement 1. In the upper figure as figure<br>
fig. 2a, it is shown that the area of overlap 7 of the barriers<br>
3, 6a, 6b and of the control electrodes 4a, 4b is small.<br>
Pushing the coupling elements 2a, 2b into one another according<br>
to figure fig. 2b also ensures electrical shielding of the<br>
shielding arrangement 1 in the area of overlap 7 and at the<br>
same time provides the possibility of compensation in the axial<br>
direction. In both states shown, however, mechanical tensioning<br>
and electrical shielding of the shielding arrangement 1<br>
according to the invention is already ensured. The coupling<br>
elements 2a, 2b can be additionally fixed with respect to one<br>
another by external fixing means (not shown).<br>
The figure fig. 3 shows the electrical shielding arrangement 1<br>
according to the invention as a disconnect point between two<br>
windings 9 of a transformer, particularly a high-voltage<br>
direct-current transmission transformer. The possibility of<br>
axial compensation for the excessive or insufficient lengths of<br>
the lines 10 along the line route provides the possibility of<br>
matching the lead-outs from the corresponding windings 9<br>
accurately to one another. No corresponding post treatment and<br>
precise matching of the coupling elements 2a, 2b to one another<br>
in the area of overlap is necessary, therefore.<br>
In this arrangement, it is also advantageous that the control<br>
electrodes 4a, 4b need a reduced insulation cover of paper at<br>
the disconnect point. The result is that a smaller direct-<br>
voltage field occurs in the paper of the disconnect point area<br>
and the permissible electrical design<br><br>
parameters are maintained. The production expenditure is<br>
reduced since correspondingly additional geometric elements for<br>
tensioning are unnecessary which, at the same time, do not<br>
allow any variability with respect to the axial compensation of<br>
the coupling elements 2a, 2b with respect to one another. The<br>
first barrier 6a is fixed on the respective tubular control<br>
electrode 4a. A corresponding barrier system 3, 6a, 6b can<br>
conduct a direct-voltage field.<br><br>

has a rounding element which is insulated.<br><br>
The invention relates to an electrical shielding arrangement (1) of a high-voltage line having at least two coupling elements (2a, 2b), wherein the<br>
coupling elements each have a tubular control electrode (4a, 4b) about a line leadthrough and are surrounded by a barrier (6a, 6b). Owing to the fact that the reduction in the diameters of the control electrode and the barrier is<br>
matched in relation to one another, a barrier decoupled in this way can be used mechanically tensioning the coupling systems which have been pushed one inside the other.</td>
