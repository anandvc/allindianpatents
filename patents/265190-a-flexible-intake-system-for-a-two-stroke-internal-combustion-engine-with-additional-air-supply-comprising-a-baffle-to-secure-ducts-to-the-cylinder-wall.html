SUCCINATE AND MALONATE SALT OF TRANS-4-((1R,3S)-6-CHLORO-3-PHENYLINDAN-1-YL)-1,2,2-TRIMETHYLPIPERAZINE AND THE USE AS A MEDICAMENT<br>
The present invention relates to 4-((1R,3S)-6-chloro-3-phenylindan-l-yl)-1,2,2-trimethylpiperazine, in particular the hydrogen succinate and the hydrogen malonate salts thereof, methods for the preparation of 4-((1R,3S)-6-chloro-3-phenylindan-l-yl)-1,2,2-trimethylpiperazin and the salts thereof, pharmaceutical compositions containing these salts and the medical use thereof, including treatment of schizophrenia or other diseases involving psychotic symptoms.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The compound, which is the subject of the present invention [4-((1R,3S)-6-chloro-3-phenylindan-l-yl)-l,2,2-trimethylpiperazine] has the general formula (I):<br><br>
and is described generically in EP 638 073.<br>
EP 638 073 covers a group of trans isomers of 3-aryl-l-(l-piperazinyl)indanes substituted in the 2- and/or 3-position of the piperazine ring. The compounds are described as having high affinity for dopamine D: and D2 receptors and the 5-HT2receptor and are suggested to be useful for treatment of several diseases in the central nervous system, including schizophrenia. EP 638 073 does not disclose the specific enantiomeric form of the above compound of formula (I), only trans isomers in the form of racemates are described.<br><br>
The enantiomer of formula (I) above has been described by B0ges0 et al. in J. Med. Chem., 1995, 38, page 4380-4392, in the form of the fiimarate salt, see table 5, compound (-)-38. This publication concludes that the (-)-enantiomers of compound 38 is a potent D1/D2 antagonists showing some D1 selectivity in vitro while in vivo it is equipotent as D1 and D2 antagonist. The compound is also described as a potent 5-HT2 antagonist and as having high affinity for a1 adrenoceptors. It is also mentioned that the compound does not induce catalepsy in rats.<br>
The corresponding racemate as well as the fiimarate salt of the above compound of formula (I) is also described by Klaus P. B0ges0 in “Drug Hunting, the Medicinal Chemistry of 1-Piperazino-3-phenylindans and Related Compounds”, 1998, ISBN 87-88085-10-4 (cf. e.g. compound 69 in table 3, p47 and in table 9A, plOl).<br>
Thus, the compound of formula (I) is a mixed D/D2 antagonists, a 5-HT2 antagonist and it has also affinity fora1 adrenoceptors. In the following is outlined the possible linkage between different diseases and the dopamine D1 and D2 receptors, the 5-HT2 receptors and the a, adrenoceptors, respectively.<br>
The aetiology of schizophrenia is not known, but the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia (Carlsson, Am. J. Psychiatry 1978,135, 164-173), formulated in the early 1960s, has provided a theoretical framework for understanding the biological mechanisms underlying this disorder. In its simplest form, the dopamine hypothesis states that schizophrenia is associated with a hyperdopaminergic state, a notion which is supported by the fact that all antipsychotic drugs on the market today exert some dopamine D2 receptor antagonism (Seeman Science and Medicine 1995, 2, 28-37). However, whereas it is generally accepted that antagonism of dopamine D2 receptors in the limbic regions of the brain plays a key role in the treatment of positive symptoms of schizophrenia, the blockade of D2 receptors in striatal regions of the brain causes extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). As described in EP 638 073 a profile of mixed dopamine D1/D2 receptor inhibition has been observed with some so-called “atypical” antipsychotic compounds, in particular with clozapine, used in treatment of schizophrenic patients.<br><br>
Central a1 antagonistic actions has also been suggested to contribute in improving antipsychotic properties (Millan et al, JPET, 2000, 292, 38-53).<br>
Further, selective D1 antagonists have been connected to treatment of sleep disorders and alcohol abuse (D.N.Eder, Current Opinion in Investigational Drugs, 2002 50:284-288).<br>
Dopamine may also play an important role in the etiology of affective disorders (P. Willner, Brain. Res. Rev. 1983, 6, 211-224, 225-236 and 237-246; J. Med. Chem., 1985, 28,1817-<br>
1828).<br>
In EP 638 073 is described how compounds having affinity for 5-HT2 receptors, in particular 5-HT2 receptors antagonists, have been suggested for treatment of different diseases, such as schizophrenia including the negative symptoms in schizophrenic patients, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, migraine attacks and neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism. 5-HT2 receptor antagonism has also been suggested to reduce the incidence of extrapyramidal side effects induced by classical neuroleptics (Balsara et al. Psychopharmacology 1979, 62, 67-69).<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Salts of the invention<br>
It has now been found that the aqueous solubility of the hydrogen succinate salt and of the hydrogen malonate salt of the compound of formula (I) is considerably larger than the aqueous solubility of the corresponding fumarate salt.<br>
As used herein the term “hydrogen succinate” salt of the compound of formula (I) refers to the 1:1 salt of the compound of formula (I) and succinic acid.<br>
As used herein the term “hydrogen malonate” salt of the compound of formula (I) refers to the 1:1 salt of the compound of formula (I) and malonic acid.<br>
The hydrogen succinate salt was found to be more stable than the fumarate salt and than the hydrogen malonate salt and to be non-hygroscopic.<br>
The hydrogen malonate salt of Compound I was found to have a stability similar to the fumarate salt when exposed to light and more stable when exposed to 60°C/80% relative humidity (RH), but less stable than the fumarate salt at 90°C. 90°C is however a very stressed condition, and does not necessarily relate to stability at normal conditions. The malonate absorbs gradually up to 1% of water when the relative humidity is raised to 95%, but with no hysterhesis. It is therefore considered as non-hygroscopic, but with good wetting properties, which indicates favourable dissolution properties.<br>
The invention also covers crystalline salts of the invention, including, e.g. anhydrates hydrates, and solvates of the salts of the invention. By the term anhydrate is meant the salts of the invention containing no crystal bound water. By hydrates is meant the salts of the invention containing crystal bound water molecules. Hydrates are usually prepared by formation of the salt in presence of some water. By solvates is meant the salts of the invention containing ciystal bound solvent molecules. Solvates are usually prepared by formation of the succinate salt in presence of the solvent. The solvent molecules in a single<br><br>
solvate may be of one or two or more different solvents. A solvate may comprise water as one of two or more organic solvents or be only a non-water solvent.<br>
One embodiment of the invention relates to the 1:1 salt of trans-4-((1R,3S)-6-Chloro-3-phenylindan-l-yl)-l,2,2-trimethylpiperazine, i.e. of the compound of formula (I), and succinic acid in the form of a crystalline anhydrate.<br>
The inventors have discovered 2 crystalline forms of the hydrogen succinate salt of Compound I (named alpha and beta).<br>
Thus, one embodiment relates to a crystalline form of the hydrogen succinate salt of<br>
Compound I, which form is named alpha and characterized by one or more of:<br>
(i) an X-Ray powder diffractogram as shown in Figure 1;<br>
(ii) an X-Ray powder diffractogram pattern as illustrated in Table I obtained using copper<br>
Ka1 radiation (λ =1.5406 A) which shows main peaks at the 29-angles given; (iii) having a DSC (Differential Scanning Calorimetry) trace which shows an endotherm<br>
with onset 139-141°C.<br>
A further embodiment relates to a crystalline form of the hydrogen succinate salt of<br>
Compound I, which form is named beta and characterized by one or more of:<br>
(i) an X-Ray powder diffractogram as shown in Figure 2;<br>
(ii) an X-Ray powder diffractogram pattern as illustrated in Table I obtained using copper<br>
Kal radiation (A-1.5406 A) which shows main peaks at the 29-angles given; (iii) having a DSC trace which shows an endotherm with onset 135-138°C.<br>
A further embodiment relates to a crystalline hydrogen malonate salt of Compound I characterized by one or more of:<br>
(i) an X-Ray powder diffractogram as shown in Figure 3;<br>
(ii) an X-Ray powder diffractogram pattern as illustrated in Table I obtained using copper Ka1, radiation (A,=l .5406 A) which shows main peaks at the 29-angles given.<br>
Table 1. Characteristic X-Ray powder diffractograms obtained using copper Ka1 radiation (Y=1.5406 A) of the crystal forms alpha and beta of the hydrogen succinate salt of Compound I, and of the crystalline hydrogen malonate salt of Compound I. Fig; cf. also Fig.<br><br>
1, Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 providing a representative XRPD pattern of polymorphic form alpha and beta of the hydrogen succinate salt and of the malonate salt of Compound I, respectively.<br><br>
As used herein by expressions like “crystalline form of a specific salt of Compound I characterized by the X-Ray powder diffractogram shown in Figure (1)” is meant the crystalline form of salt of Compound I in question having an X-ray powder diffractogram substantially similar to Figure (1), i.e. exhibiting an X-ray powder diffraction pattern substantially as exemplified in that Figure and measured under comparable conditions as described herein or by any comparable method.<br>
Generally, all data herein are understood to be approximate and subject to normal measurement error depending e.g. on the apparatus used and other parameters influencing peak positions and peak intensities.<br>
The invention also relates to a solid hydrogen succinate salt of Compound I which solid salt consist mainly of the alpha form as compared to the total amount of the salt. In one embodiment, the term “mainly” means that the solid hydrogen succinate salt of Compound I consist of at least 75%, such as at least 80%, at least 90%, or at least 95% crystalline alpha form as compared to the total hydrogen succinate salt of Compound I present.<br>
The invention also relates to a solid hydrogen succinate salt of Compound I which solid salt consist mainly of the beta form as compared to the total amount of the salt. In one embodiment, the term “mainly” means that the solid hydrogen succinate salt of Compound I consist of at least 75%, such as at least 80%, at least 90%, or at least 95% crystalline beta form as compared to the total hydrogen succinate salt of Compound I present.<br>
The invention also relates to any mixtures of the crystalline forms of the hydrogen succinate salt of the invention, e.g. a mixture of the alpha and beta crystalline form of the hydrogen succinate salt of Compound I.<br><br>
Preparation of the salts of the invention<br>
The succinate salt according to the invention may be obtained by treatment of the free base of a compound of formula (I) with succinic acid in an inert solvent followed by precipitation, isolation and optionally recrystallization. If desired, the crystalline salt may thereafter be subjected to micronisation by wet or dry milling or another convenient process, or preparation of particles from a solvent-emulsification process.<br>
Precipitation of the succinate salt of the invention is preferably carried out by dissolving the free base of the compound of formula (I) in a suitable solvent, such as acetone or toluene, and thereafter mixing this solution to a suspension or solution of succinic acid in a suitable solvent, such as acetone, aqueous acetone or toluene. In one embodiment the solvent is a mixture of acetone and water, e.g. a mixture consisting essentially of acetone and about 2% to 10%, preferably about 5% water, based on the weight of the mixture. The resulting suspension may be heated or solvent may be added until all succinic acid has dissolved. The succinate salt of the compound of the invention is precipitated, preferably upon cooling of the solution. The succinate salt of the invention may optionally be recrystallised one or more times and isolated by filtration, washed, e.g. with acetone, and dried.<br>
The invention also relates to a method for the preparation of the crystalline beta form of the hydrogen succinate salt of Compound I, which method comprises leaving an aqueous solution of hydrogen succinate salt of Compound I for slow evaporation of the solvent at ambient conditions.<br>
The malonate salt may be obtained using analogous procedures. Accordingly, the malonate salt according to the invention may be obtained by treatment of the free base of a compound of formula (I) with malonic acid in an inert solvent followed by precipitation, isolation and optionally recrystallisation. If desired, the crystalline salt may thereafter be subjected to micronisation by wet or dry milling or another convenient process, or preparation of particles from a solvent-emulsification process.<br>
Precipitation of malonate salt of the invention is preferably carried out by dissolving the free base of the compound of formula (I) in a suitable solvent, e.g. 2-propanol, and thereafter mixing this solution to a suspension or solution of malonic acid in a suitable solvent, e.g. 2-<br><br>
propanol. The suspension may be heated until all malonic acid has dissolved. The malonate salt of the compound of the invention precipitated, preferably upon cooling of the solution. The malonate salt of the invention may optionally be recrystallised one or more times and isolated by filtration, washed, e.g. in 2-propanol, and dried.<br>
Preparation of the compound of formula (I)<br>
The compound of formula (I) in racemic form may be prepared as described in EP 638 073, and in B0ges0 et al. J. Med. Chem., 1995, 38, page 4380-4392, it is described how optical resolution of the racemic compound may be accomplished by crystallisation of diastereomeric salts thereby obtaining the enantiomer of formula (I).<br>
The present inventors have now developed an improved route of synthesis in which the enantiomer of formula (I) is obtained via a synthetic sequence starting from enantiomeric pure V, i.e. compound Va((lS,3S)-6-chloro-3-phenylindan-l-ol, see below). Thus, in this process, the intermediate of formula V is resolved, e.g. by chiral chromatography or enzymatically, to obtain the enantiomer of formula Va. This new route of synthesis to obtain the compound of formula (I) is much more efficient than the above mentioned crystallisation of diastereomeric salts of the final product I. In particular the yield of the resolution is substantially higher in this new method (45% relative to the amount of racemic starting material, i.e. maximum theoretical yield is 50%) as compared to the yield (22% relative to the amount of racemic starting material, i.e. maximum theoretical yield is 50%) for the resolution of the final product I by crystallisation of diastereomeric salts. Another advantage of this invention is that the enantiomeric purity of (I) is higher (higher than 99%ee) when synthesised according to the invention as compared to the synthesis using crystallisation of diastereomeric salts (95.4%ee). Furthermore, the resolution of an intermediate instead of the final product gives a much more efficient synthesis, as only the right enantiomer is used in the subsequent steps, giving e.g. higher volume yields and less consumption of reagents.<br><br>
Accordingly, the enantiomer of formula (I) may be obtained by a process involving the following steps:<br><br>
Benzyl cyanide is reacted with 2,5-dichlorobenzonitril in the presence of a base, suitably potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) in a suitable solvent such as dimethyl ether (DME), farther reaction with methyl chloro acetate (MCA) leads to spontaneous ring closure and one pot formation of the compound of formula (II).<br>
The compound of formula (II) is then subjected to acidic hydrolysis to form a compound of formula (III), suitably by heating in a mixture of acetic acid, sulphuric acid and water, and thereafter decarboxylation by heating the compound of formula (III) in a suitable solvent, such as toluene with triethyl amine or N-methyl pyrrolidone, to form a compound of formula (IV).<br><br>
The compound of formula (TV) is then reduced, suitably with NaBH4 in a solvent such as an alcohol, e.g. ethanol or iso-propanol, and preferably at a temperature in the range of-30° to +30°C, e.g. below 30 °C, below 20 °C, below 10 °C, or preferably below 5 °C, to form a compound of formula (V) with cis configuration:<br><br><br>
The compound of formula (V) is resolved to achieve the desired enantiomer (formula Va), i.e. also with cis configuration ((1S,3S)-6-chloro-3-phenylindan-l-ol):<br><br>
The resolution of (V) to (Va) may, e.g., be performed using chiral chromatography, preferably liquid chromatography, suitably on a chiral column of silicagel coated with a chiral polymer, e.g. a modified amylose, preferably amylose tris-(3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate) coated on silicagel. A suitable solvent is used for the chiral liquid chromatography, such as, e.g. an alcohol, a nitrile, an ether, or an alkane, or mixtures thereof, suitably ethanol, methanol, iso-propanol, acetonitrile, or methyl tert-butyl ether or mixtures thereof, preferably methanol or acetonitrile. The chiral liquid chromatography can be scaled up using suitable technologies, e.g. simulated moving bead technology (SMB).<br>
Alternatively, the compound of formula (V) is resolved to achieve Compound Va by enzymatic resolution. It has been found that enantiomerically pure Compound Va, or acylated derivatives thereof, may be prepared by enzymatic enantioselective acylation of the hydroxyl group in racemic Compound V to obtain Compound Va or an acylated derivative thereof with high optical purity. Alternatively, enantiomerically pure Compound Va may also be obtained by a process comprising converting racemic Compound V to a<br><br>
corresponding ester in the hydroxyl position followed by an enzymatic enantioselective deacylation. Use of enzymatic enantioselective deacylation has been reported for other compounds.<br>
Accordingly, The resolution of Compound V to Compound Va may be performed by selective enzymatic acylation. Selective enzymatic acylation means that the enzymatic acylation is preferentially effective for conversion of one of the cis- enantiomers of the compound of formula Compound V leaving the other cis-enantiomer of Compound V as unconverted in the reaction mixture.<br>
Alternatively, The resolution of Compound V to Compound Va may be performed by selective enzymatic deacylation. Selective enzymatic deacylation means that the enzymatic deacylation is preferentially effective for conversion of one of the esters of compound of formula (V), leaving the other ds-enantiomer of esters of a compound of formula (V) as unconverted in the reaction mixture.<br><br>
Suitable esters (Vb) of the compound of formula (V) are ester such as acetate, propionate, butyrate, valerate, hexanoate, benzoate, laurate, isobutyrate, 2-naethylbutyrate, 3-methylbutyrate, pivalate, 2-methylvalerate, 3-methylvalerate, 4-methylvalerate<br><br><br>
wherein R, e.g., is acetate, propionate, butyrate, valerate, hexanoate, benzoate, laurate, isobutyrate, 2-methylbutyrate, 3-methylbutyrate, pivalate, 2-methylvalerate, 3-methylvalerate, 4-methylvalerate.<br>
Thus, one embodiment relates to a process for the preparation of the (S, S)- or (R, R)-enantiomer of the compound of formula V (i.e. with cis configuration) comprising:<br>
a)	subjecting a racemic Compound V to enantioselective enzymatic acylation using an acylating agent, or<br>
b)	subjecting a racemic Compound Vb to entantioselective enzymatic deacylation to form a mixture of deacylated Compound Va.<br>
Enantioselective enzymatic acylation means that the enzymatic acylation is preferentially effective for conversion of one of the enantiomers of a compound of formula (V) preferentially leaving the other enantiomer of the compound of formula (V) unconverted in the reaction mixture. Enantioselective enzymatic deacylation means that the enzymatic deacylation is preferentially effective for conversion of one of the enantiomers of a compound of formula (Vb), preferentially leaving the other enantiomer of the compound of formula (Vb ) unconverted in the reaction mixture.<br>
The mixtures obtained by the enzymatic resolution may not be entirely pure, e.g. they may contain a smaller amount of the other enantiomer in addition to a larger amount of the desired enantiomer (Va). The composition mixture obtained after acylation or deacylation according to the invention depend, i.a., on the specific hydrolase used and the conditions under which the reaction is carried out. Characteristic of the enzymatic acylation/deacylation according to the invention is that a considerably larger portion of one enantiomer is converted than of the other. The enantioselective acylation according to the invention thus results in a mixture containing preferentially the compound of formula (Vb) in the (R, R -form and the compound of formula (Va) in the (S, S)-form, or it may result in a mixture containing preferentially the compound of formula (Vb) in the (S, S)-form and the compound of formula (Va) in the (R, R)-form. Likewise, the enantioselective enzymatic deacylation may result in a mixture containing preferentially the compound of formula (Vb) in the (S, S)-form and the compound of formula (V) in the (R, R)-form, or it may result in a<br><br>
mixture containing preferentially the compound of formula (Va) in the (R, R)-form and the compound of formula (Va) in the (S, S)-form. The optical purity of the Va obtained by the optical resolution method of the present invention is usually at least 90% ee., preferably at least 95% ee., more preferably at least 97% ee and most preferably at least 98% ee. However, lower values for the optical purity are acceptable.<br>
According to the invention, enantioselective enzymatic acylation is carried out under conditions substantially suppressing hydrolysis. Hydrolysis, which is the reverse reaction of the acylation reaction, takes place if water is present in the reaction system. Thus, enantioselective enzymatic acylation is preferably carried out in a water-free organic solvent or almost anhydrous organic solvent (enzymes normally require the presence of some water to be active). Suitable solvents include hydrocarbons such as hexane, heptane, benzene and toluene; ethers such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, tetrahydrofiiran, 1,4-dioxane, tert-butyl methyl ether and dimethoxyethane; ketones such as acetone, diethyl ketone, butanon, and methyl ethyl ketone; esters such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, ethyl butyrate, vinyl butyrate and ethyl benzoate; halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, chloroform and 1,1,1-trichloroethane; secondary and tertiary alcohols, such as tert-butanol; nitrogen-containing solvents such as dimethylformatnide, acetoamide, formamide, acetonitrile and propionitrile; and aprotic polar solvents such as dimethylsulfoxide, N-methylpyrrolidone and hexamethylphosphorous triamide. Preferred organic solvents for enzymatic acylation are organic solvents such as toluene, hexane, heptane, dioxane and tetrahydrofuran (THF).<br>
Suitable irreversible acyldonors are, e.g., acyldonors such as vinyl-esters, 2-propenyl-esters or 2,2,2-trihalid-ethyl-esters.<br>
Enantioselective enzymatic deacylation is preferably carried out in water or a mixture of water and an organic solvent, suitable in presence of a buffer. Suitable organic solvents, e.g., are solvents miscible with water such as alcohols, acetonitrile, dimethyl formamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 1,4-dioxane, DME and diglyme.<br><br>
It has been found that enzymatic acylation according to the invention may be carried out using Novozym 435 (Candida Antarctica lipase B, from Novozymes A/S, Fluka Cat.-No. 73940). In general, the enzymatic acylation or deacylation according to the invention is preferably carried out using a lipase, an esterase, an acylase or a protease. The enzymes useful according to the invention are such enzymes capable of performing R-selective acylation or S-selective acylation of the hydroxy group in the racemic compound of formula (V) or such enzymes which are capable of performing R-selective deacylation or S-selective deacylation of the acyl group in the racemic compound of formula (Vb). In particular immobilized forms of the enzyme, including Cross-Linked Enzyme Crystal (CLEC) are useful according to the invention. A preferred embodiment relates to use of a lipase for carrying out the enzymatic resolution of Compound V. The most preferred lipase is Candida antarctica lipase (Fluka Cat.-No. 62299); Pseudomonas cepacia lipase (Fluka Cat.-No. 62309); Novozym CALB L (Candida antarctica lipase B) (Novozymes A/S); Novozym 435 (Candida antarctica lipase B) (Novozymes A/S); or Lipozyme TLIM (Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase) (Novozymes A/S), preferably in immobilized form.<br>
The alcohol group of the cZs-alcohol of formula (Va) is converted to a suitable leaving group, such as, e.g., a halogen, e.g. Cl or Br, preferably Cl, or a sulphonate, e.g. mesylate or tosylate, suitably by reaction with an agent, such as thionyl chloride, mesyl chloride or tosyl chloride, in an inert solvent, e.g. an ether, suitably tetrahydrofuran. The resulting compound has formula (VI), where LG is the leaving group:<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment, LG is Cl, i.e. the cis-chloride of formula (Via):<br><br><br>
Compound VI, e.g. with LG as chloro, is then reacted with 2,2-dimethylpiperazine in a suitable solvent, e.g. a ketone such as, e.g., methyl isobutyl ketone or methyl ethyl ketone, preferably methyl isobutyl ketone in presence of a base, such as e.g., potassium carbonate. The resulting compound of formula (VII):<br><br>
is methylated at the secondary amine functionality (suitably by reductive amination using suitable agents, such as, e.g., formaldehyde, paraformaldehyde, trioxane, or diethoxy methane (DEM)) to obtain the free base of a compound of formula (I).<br><br>
Alternatively, the methyl group may be introduced directly by use of 1,2,2-trimethyl piperazine (Formula VIII below) instead of 2,2-dimethyl piperazine when reacting with Compound VI, e.g. where LG is Cl, thereby shortening the synthesis by one step.<br><br><br>
Furthermore, the piperazine part of the molecule may be introduced by reacting Compound VI with a compound of formula (IX) below, where PG is a protecting group such as, but not restricted to, e.g. phenylmethoxycarbonyl (often called Cbz or Z), tert-butyloxycarbonyl (often called BOC), ethoxycarbonyl, or benzyl, thereby obtaining the compound of formula (X) below.<br><br>
After deprotection of the product to (VII), methylation as discussed above gives the final product, Compound I. Alternatively, the protecting group such as e.g. ethoxycarbonyl may be converted directly to a methyl group using a suitable reducing agent, e.g. lithium aluminium hydride.<br>
During the synthesis some cis diastereoisomer of Compound I (i.e.4-((1R,3S)-6-chloro-3-phenylindan-l-yl)-l,2,2-trimethylpiperazine) is formed as an impurity in the final product. This impurity is due mainly to the formation of some of the trans form of (VI) {e.g. (IS,3R)-3,5-dichloro-l-phenylindan when LG is Cl) in the step where Compound VI is formed. Therefore, the impurity can be minimized by crystallisation of the desired cis form of Compound VI, from the mixture of trans and cis (VI); in the case where LG is Cl in Compound VI this can be done by stirring the mixture with a suitable solvent, e.g. an allcane, such as heptane, whereby the desired cis form of VI precipitates and the undesired trans form of Compound VI goes into solution. The desired cis form of Compound VI {e.g. when LG is Cl) is isolated by filtration, washed with the solvent in question and dried.<br><br>
If the cis form of Compound VI is present in the batch of (VI) used in the synthesis of Compound VII, this will give raise to the formation of the trans form of Compound VII (i.e. 4-((1R,3S)-6-chloro-3-phenylindan-l-yl)-3J3-dimethylpiperazme) as an impurity in (VII); this gives a second option of avoiding the cis form of Compound I in the final product: It has been found that the cis form of Compound VII can be removed by precipitation of a suitable salt of the compound of formula Compound VII, e.g. a salt of an organic acid, such as an organic diacid, suitably the hydrogen fumarate salt or the hydrogen maleate salt of the compound of formula (VII), optionally followed by one more re-crystallisations.<br>
Furthermore, it has been found that impurities in the form of cis diastereoisomer in (I) (i.e. 4-((1R,3S)-6-chloro-3-phenylindan-l-yl)-l,2,2-trimethylpiperazine) may effectively be removed by precipitation of a suitable salt of the compound of formula (I), e.g. a salt of an organic acid, such as an organic diacid, suitably a fumarate salt, e.g. the hydrogen fumarate salt of the compound of formula (I) optionally followed by one or more re-crystallisations.<br>
