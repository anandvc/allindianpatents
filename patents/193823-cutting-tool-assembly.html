FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention refers to a tool assembly comprising at least two members releasably coupled together in such a manner as to enable transfer of a rotary torque from one member to another. The invention particularly refers to a rotary cutting tool assembly for use in such operations as drilling, milling and the like.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
One example of a rotary cutting tool assembly having a coupling arrangement of the above-specified kind is disclosed in EP 0742065. The assembly comprises first and second assembly components having interfitting male and female coupling members formed at their interacting faces, the coupling members having radially directed arm portions for torque transmission, and a centering portion located therebetween. The coupling members are coaxially coupled together by a fastening screw.<br>
The use of fastening screws in cutting tool assemblies of the above kind weakens the cutting tool and puts rather severe limitations on the miniaturization of the tool when rotary cutting tool assemblies of small diameters are concerned, since these tools have axially extending chip flutes, and, consequently, do not have a cross-sectional area sufficiently large and a tool body sufficiently strong to accommodate appropriate fastening screws.<br>
EP 0118 806 discloses a drilling tool assembly comprising a cylindrical tool shank formed with two helical chip flutes extending generally along a longitudinal axis thereof and a drilling head removably mounted thereto in a self-holding manner not requiring a fastening screw.<br><br>
-2-<br>
Thus, the drilling head comprises two diametrically oppositely disposed substantially planar cutting portions in the form of cutting plates and the tool shank has two diametrically oppositely disposed and radially oriented recesses formed at side surfaces of the chip flutes, the recesses mating with and being capable of receiving.the cutting plates of the drilling head. The cutting plates and the recesses have narrow base surfaces oriented substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the tool and wide side walls oriented transversely to the base surfaces and generally radially with respect to the longitudinal axis. The drilling tool assembly is further provided with fixation means in the form of a male fixation member axially protruding from the drilling head and capable of being received within a correspondingly shaped female fixation member formed in the tool holder. The fixation members are concentric with the longitudinal axis of the tool shank and have a radial extension substantially less than that of the cutting head and the tool shank. The fixation members widen in the direction away from the drilling head.<br>
The drilling head is mounted in the tool shank by the insertion of the cutting plates in a position approximately in the middle of the flutes and rotating the drilling head in the direction counter to the drill rotation direction until the base surfaces of the cutting plates are fully supported by corresponding base surfaces of the recesses in the tool shank and the side walls of the cutting plates abut corresponding side walls of the recesses. During a cutting operation, the base surfaces of the drilling head and the recesses provide for the support of the drilling head against the cutting forces acting thereon, and their side walls function as torque transmission surfaces. The interaction of peripheral surfaces of the fixation members ensures the centering of the assembly and prevents the drilling head from being detached from or pulled out of the tool shank when the cutting tool is withdrawn from a workpiece being machined.<br>
It should, however, be noted that the drilling head with a planar configuration as above is rather weak, especially when employed under torsion conditions. Furthermore, tools with cutting heads having a small<br><br>
-3 -<br>
thickness relative to the cross-sectional area of their tool shank are not sufficiently stable.<br>
For the drilling head of the above planar design to be stronger and for the assembly with the above narrow support surfaces to be more stable, the side walls of the cutting plates and the tool shank recesses usually have an axial height substantially greater than the thickness of the drilling head body. This renders the tool assembly design described above hardly applicable to small and, particularly, to miniature cutting tools.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide a new rotary cutting tool assembly which has advantages in the above respect.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a rotary cutting tool assembly comprising a cutting head and a tool shank having a longitudinal axis and at least two chip flutes extending from said cutting head to a rear of the tool shank;<br>
said cutting head having a cutting portion adjacent a leading end and a cutting head mounting portion adjacent a trailing end thereof, said cutting head mounting portion having a pair of diametrically oppositely disposed cutting head coupling portions;<br>
said tool shank having a cutting head receiving portion formed at a front face thereof and comprising a pair of diametrically oppositely disposed tool shank coupling portions each extending between said two flutes and having a stepped configuration, the tool shank coupling portions being adapted to receive said tool shank coupling portions;<br>
said tool shank and cutting head coupling portions each having a support surface oriented substantially perpendicular to said longitudinal axis and a torque transmission wall oriented substantially transversely to said support surface and generally radially with respect to said longitudinal axis;<br>
said cutting head and said tool shank having male and female fixation members which are concentric with the tool assembly;<br>
characterised in that<br><br>
-4-<br>
the cutting head is circumferentially co-extensive with the tool shank and the cutting head coupling portions mate in shape and dimensions the tool shank coupling portions, each coupling portion having a lowered base surface adjacent one of said flutes, a raised base surface adjacent the other flute and a side wall therebetween, at least one of the base surfaces constituting said support surface and said side wall constituting said torque transmission wall.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a cutting head for use in a rotary cutting tool having a tool shank with a longitudinal axis and at least two chip flutes extending therealong, said cutting head being adapted for mounting at a front face of said tool shank coaxially therewith;<br>
said cutting head having a cutting portion adjacent a leading end and a cutting head mounting portion adjacent a trailing end thereof, said cutting head mounting portion having a pair of diametrically oppositely disposed cutting head coupling portions;<br>
said cutting Head coupling portions each having a support surface oriented substantially perpendicular to said longitudinal axis and a torque transmission wall oriented substantially transversely to said support surface and generally radially with respect to said longitudinal axis;<br>
said cutting head having a fixation member which is concentric therewith;<br>
characterised in that<br>
the cutting head is circumferentially co-extensive with the tool shank and each cutting head coupling portion has a lowered base surface adjacent one of said flutes, a raised base surface adjacent the other flute and a side wall therebetween, at least one of the base surfaces constituting said support surface and said side wall constituting said torque transmission wall.<br>
Preferably, the side walls of the cutting head and the tool shank coupling portions have an axial dimension which is substantially less than a distance between radially outermost points of said two chip flutes at said front face of the tool shank. Still more preferably, the axial dimension of<br><br>
-5 -<br>
said side walls of the cutting head and the tool shank coupling portions does not exceed, and even may be substantially less than half of, said distance between the radially outermost points of the two chip flutes. It is also preferable that the axial dimension of said side walls is less than a distance from the lowered base surfaces of the cutting head coupling portions to said leading end thereof.<br>
Preferably, the cutting head is formed with chip flute sections which merge continuously with the chip flutes formed in the tool shank. Thereby, the entire assembly has a complete smooth design and the continuous chip flutes thereof enable very smooth chip evacuation.<br>
Preferably, the lowered base surfaces of the cutting head coupling portions belong to recesses formed at the trailing end of the cutting head, and the raised base surfaces of the tool shank coupling portions belong to protrusions formed at the front face of the tool shank, the recesses and the protrusions being each bound, on their one side, by an adjacent flute, on their other side, by said side wall and, adjacent said longitudinal axis, by a central wall merging with said side wall. Preferably, the side and central walls merge with each other via a rounded corner.<br>
In a first embodiment of the present invention, said central walls of the protrusions and'the recesses constitute peripheral walls of respectively said male and female fixation members, the peripheral walls of the coupling portions of each fixation member having a central base surface therebetween. In a second embodiment of the present invention, said male fixation member protrudes from the trailing end of the cutting head and said female fixation member is recessed with respect to the front face of the tool shank.

Preferably, the locking means comprise two diametrically oppositely disposed flexible cylindrical locking pins projecting axially from the central base surface of the female fixation member and oriented substantially co-directionally with the peripheral walls of the male and female fixation members, and two locking receptacles in the form of arcuate depressions formed in the side surfaces of the male fixation member and adapted to receive therein said locking pins.<br>
The tool assembly according to the present invention may further be provided with a device for assembling and dissembling thereof. The assembling device comprises an elongated cylindrical cavity of a diameter corresponding to the diameter of said cutting tool, at least said cavity being made of an elastic material, the cavity comprising a cutting head holding section and a tool shank receiving section, which sections are capable of resiliently encompassing the cutting head and the cutting head receiving portion of the tool shank, the cutting head holding section having the shape complementary to an outer configuration of the cutting head, whereby the rotation thereof relative to the said assembling device is avoided, and being provided with means preventing the cutting head from falling out of the cutting head holding section of the assembling device.<br>
The coupling arrangement according to the present invention allows the cutting head to have a strong wide trailing end with a maximal available cross-sectional area and short side, torque transmission walls, whereby the stability of the cutting tool assembly is improved. This renders the coupling arrangement of the present invention particularly useful for miniature cutting tool assemblies.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
A rotary cutting tool assembly 1 according to a first embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in Fig. 1. The cutting tool assembly<br><br>
-8-<br>
1 comprises a cutting head 2 and a tool shank 4 having a longitudinal axis 6 and 180°-rotational symmetry with respect to the longitudinal axis 6. The cutting head 2 and the tool shank 4 have mating circumferential shapes and dimensions and are formed with respective chip flute sections 8a, 10a and 8b, 10b such that, when the cutting tool is assembled, the sections 8a and 8b and the sections 10a and 10b form continuous, preferably helical, flutes 8 and 10 which extend from the cutting head 2 to a rear of the tool shank 4.<br>
As illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3, the cutting head 2 has a cutting portion 12 adjacent the cutting head leading end 13 and a cutting head mounting portion 14 adjacent the cutting head trailing end 15.<br>
The cutting portion 12 of the cutting head will not be described herein since it does not constitute the subject matter of the present invention. However, it should be noted that the cutting portion 12 of the cutting head may have any appropriate design.<br>
The cutting head mounting portion 14 comprises a pair of diametrically oppositely disposed cutting head coupling portions 20 each extending between the chip flute sections 8a and 10a and, as illustrated in Fig. 3, defined by a distance D between radially outermost points 21' and 21" thereof. As seen in Fig. 2, each cutting head coupling portion 20 has a stepped configuration with a lowered base surface 22 adjacent one chip flute section 8a, 10a, a raised base surface 24 adjacent the other chip flute ] section 10a, 8a, a side wall 26 therebetween and a central wall 28 merging with the side wall 26 via a rounded corner 27, the lowered base surface 22 and the side and central walls 26 and 28 defining therebetween a recess 29. The cutting head coupling portions 20 have a central base surface 30 therebetween.<br>
As seen in Fig. 2, the lowered, raised and central base surfaces 22, 24 and 30 of the cutting head are substantially planar and are oriented generally perpendicular to the longitudinal axis 6, and the side wall 26 and the central wall 28 are co-directional with the longitudinal axis 6. As seen in Fig. 3, the side wall 26 extends generally radially and the central wall 28<br><br>
-9-<br>
extends circumferentially with respect to the longitudinal axis 6. It should be understood that the side wall 26 does not necessarily need to be a planar surface but rather may be in the form of a curved plane, only a portion of which extends radially. Furthermore, the side wall 26 may not extend exactly in the radial direction but may rather be oriented at a relatively small angle thereto.<br>
An axial dimension d (Fig. 2) of the side wall 26 of each cutting head coupling portion 20 is substantially less than the distance D (Fig. 3) between the radially outermost points 21' and 21" of the respective chip flutes sections 8a and 10a. The axial dimension d does not exceed and, preferably, is substantially less than half of the distance D and is less than a height H (Fig. 2) of the cutting head 2 measured between the leading end 13 and the lowered base surfaces 24 thereof.<br>
As may be seen in Figs. 1, 2, 6 and 7 and best shown in Fig. 8, the central walls 28 are in the form of conical arcs diverging in the direction away from the cutting head leading end 13, the conical arcs having axes (not shown) which may or may not coincide with the longitudinal axis 6. <br>
As shown in Figs. 4 and 5, the tool shank 4 has a front face 40 with a cutting head receiving portion 42 formed thereon. The cutting head receiving portion 42 has diametrically oppositely disposed tool shank coupling portions 44 mating in shape and dimensions with the cutting head coupling portions 20. Thus, each tool shank coupling portion 44 comprises a raised base surface 48, a lowered base surface 50, a side wall 52 therebetween and a central wall 54 merging with the side wall 52. The raised base surface 48 and the side and central walls 52 and 54 define between them protrusions 56 mating with and adapted to be received in the recesses 29 of the cutting head mounting portion 14. The tool shank coupling portions 44 have a central base surface 60 therebetween. The raised, lowered and central base surfaces 48, 50 and 60 and the side and central walls 52 and 54 of the tool shank coupling portions 44 correspond in orientation and dimensions to the respective lowered, raised and central<br><br>
- 10-<br>
base surfaces 22, 24 and 30 and side and central walls 26 and 28 of the cutting head coupling portions 20,(as shown in Fig 2).<br>
As seen in Figs. 2, 3 and 4, the cutting head and the tool shank are further provided with respective male and female guiding members 64 (Fig. 2) and 66 (Fig. 4), which may also be arranged vice versa, for the simplification of mounting the cutting head 2 to the tool shank 4.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 6, the cutting head mounting portion 14 of the cutting head 2 is mounted to the cutting head receiving portion 42 of the tool shank 4 by the transverse insertion of the cutting head coupling portions 20 between the protrusions 56 of the tool shank coupling portions 44, and rotating the cutting head 2 in the direction A (counter the rotation direction of the cutting tool).until the side walls 26 of the cutting head coupling portions 20 abut the corresponding side walls 52 of the tool shank coupling portions 44 and the protrusions 56 of the latter coupling portions 44 are fully received in the recesses 29 of the former coupling portions 20.<br>
The cutting tool 1 described above, as assembled, is illustrated in Figs. 7 and 8. During a cutting operation, the axial support of the cutting head 2 in the tool shank 4 is provided by the contact of the lowered and central base surfaces 22 and 30 of the cutting head 2 with the respective raised and central base surfaces 48 and 60 of the tool shank 4. The side walls 26 and 52 of, respectively, the cutting head 2 and the tool shank 4 function as torque transmission surfaces. The central walls 28 and 54 of, respectively, the cutting head 2 and the tool shank 4, which diverge in the direction away from the leading end 13 of the cutting head 2, interact in a dove-tail manner, whereby an accurate fixation and centering of the cutting head in the tool shank is provided. Such a fixation arrangement prevents the drilling head from being detached from or pulled out of the tool shank when the cutting tool is withdrawn from a workpiece being machined.<br>
Figs. 9 to 14 illustrate a cutting tool assembly 101 according to a second embodiment of the present invention, in which a coupling arrangement is generally similar to that of the cutting tool assembly 1 illustrated in Figs. 1 to 8, and which differs therefrom mainly in the design of the fixation<br><br>
-11 -<br>
arrangement. Therefore, in the description of the cutting tool assembly 101 hereinbelow, only those parts thereof will be referred to, which are relevant to the description of the fixation arrangement.<br>
As seen in Fig. 9, the cutting tool assembly 101 comprises a cutting head 102 and a tool shank 104 having a longitudinal axis 106 and two chip flutes (not designated).<br>
The cutting head 102 shown separately in Fig. 10, has a cutting portion 112 adjacent the cutting head leading end 113 and a cutting head mounting portion 114 adjacent the cutting head trailing end 115. The cutting head mounting portion 114 comprises a pair of diametrically oppositely disposed cutting head coupling portions 120 each having a recess 129.<br>
The tool shank 104 shown in Fig. 11 has a front face 140 with a cutting head receiving portion 142 formed thereon. The cutting head receiving portion 142 has tool shank coupling portions 144 with protrusions 156 mating in shape and dimensions with the recesses 129 of the cutting head coupling portions 120.<br>
As seen in Figs. 9, 10 and 11, the cutting tool assembly 101 is provided with male and female fixation members 200 and 210 formed respectively in the cutting head 102 and the tool shank 104 concentrically therewith and having a radial dimension substantially less than a radial dimension of the cutting head and the tool shank. The male fixation member 200 of the cutting head 102 protrudes from the trailing end 115 thereof and the female fixation member 210 of the tool shank 104 is recessed with respect to the front face 140 thereof.<br>
As shown in Figs. 10 and 11, the male and female fixation members 200 and 210 have respective peripheral walls 128 and 152 and central base surfaces 130 and 154 therebetween, which have the shape and interact in the fashion similar to that of the respective central walls 28 and 52 and central base surfaces 30 and 54 of the cutting head coupling members 20 and the tool shank coupling members 44 of the cutting tool assembly 1. Thus, as seen in Fig. 12, the peripheral walls 128 and 152 of<br><br>
- 12-<br>
the male and female fixation members 200 and 210 diverge away from the leading end 113 of the cutting head 102 and cooperate in a dove-tail manner.<br>
The cutting tool assemblies 1 and 101 according to the present invention may be provided with locking means. One example of such locking means, as applied to the cutting tool assembly 101, will be described hereinbelow with reference to Figs. 10, 11 and 13.<br>
The locking means comprise two cylindrical locking pins 220 (Figs. 11 and 13) projecting axially from the central base surface 154 of the female fixation member 200 of the tool shank 104 and disposed adjacent the peripheral walls 152 thereof and two corresponding cylindrical locking receptacles 222 (Figs. 10 and 13) formed in the peripheral walls 128 of the male fixation member 200 of the cutting head 102 and adapted to receive therein the locking pins 220. The locking pins 220 are inclined towards the longitudinal axis 106 such as to be generally co-directional with the diverging peripheral walls 128 and 152 of the respective male and female fixation members 200 and 210.<br>
As seen in Fig. 13, the locking pins 220 are arranged in the tool shank 104 in a flexible manner which, in the described embodiment, is obtained by mounting each of the locking pins 220 in an elongated bore 230 formed in the tool shank 104 adjacent the peripheral walls 152 thereof and having two bore sections of different radial dimensions so that a lower portion 232 of the pin 220 fits snugly in a lower narrow section 236 of the bore 230, and an upper section 240 of the pin 220 is surrounded by an upper wide section 242 of the bore 230, being slightly radially bendable therein. The elongated bore 230 is disposed adjacent the peripheral walls 152 of the female fixation member 210 in such a manner that its upper wide portion 242 constitutes a partial continuation of a cylindrical depression 246 formed in the peripheral walls 152. The upper wide portion 242 of the bore 230 and the cylindrical depression 246 preferably have a radially elongated cross-sectional shape so as to enable required radial bending of the locking pins 220.<br><br>
- 13 -<br>
Thus, when during assembling of the cutting tool 101, the-cutting head 102 is inserted in the cutting head receiving portion 142 of the tool shank 104 and rotated in the direction A, the peripheral walls 128 of the male fixation member 200 bias the pins 220 radially outwardly towards the peripheral walls 152 of the female fixation member 210.<br>
Upon the abutment of the side walls 26 of the cutting head coupling portions 20 against the side walls 52 of the tool shank coupling portions 44, the rotation of the cutting head 102 is terminated and the locking pins 220 enter the locking receptacles 222. Preferably, the orientation of the locking pins 220 is such that they bias associated surfaces of the receptacles 222 and, consequently, the cutting head in the direction A. Thereby, reliable locking of the cutting head 102 in its mounting position is obtained.<br>
The cutting tool assemblies described above may be further provided with an assembling device. Thus, Figs. 14 and 15 illustrate two examples of such a device for use with the cutting tool assembly 101. As seen, the assembling device 300 (Fig. 14) and 400 (Fig. 15) each have an elongated cylindrical cavity 310, 410 of a diameter corresponding to the diameter of the cutting tool 101. The assembling devices 300 and 400, or at least their cavities 310 and 410, are made of an elastic material and comprise a cutting head holding section 320, 420 and a tool shank receiving section 330, 430, which are capable of resiliently encompassing the cutting head 102 and the cutting head receiving portion 142 of the tool shank 104. The cutting head holding sections 320 and 420 of the cavities 310 and 410 have the shape complementary to an outer configuration of the cutting head 102 and, consequently, comprise convex portions 340 and 440 which are capable of entering the chip flute sections of the cutting head, whereby the rotation thereof relative to the assembling devices 300 and 400 is avoided. The assembling devices 300 and 400 may be further provided with means preventing the cutting head from falling out of the cutting head holding sections 320 and 420 of the devices. Thus, in the assembling device 300 shown in Fig. 14, these means are in the form of flexible elements 350 and,<br><br>
- 14-<br>
in the assembling device 400 shown in Fig. 15, these means are constituted by the convex elements 440 formed with an appropriate shape and dimensions. Alternatively, or in addition to the above elements 350 and 440, the cutting head holding sections 320 and 420 of the cylindrical cavities 310 and 410 may have a diameter which is slightly less than that of the cutting head 102 to enable the press-seating thereof in the corresponding cutting head holding section. When the cutting tool 101 is dissembled, the cutting head is released from the respective assembling device either by pushing it out of the device 300 at a rear end 360 thereof (Fig. 14), or by pulling it out of the device 400 at a front end 460 thereof.<br>
The cutting tool assembly of the present invention and components thereof may have alternative designs comprising features different from those described above and shown in the drawings.<br><br>
