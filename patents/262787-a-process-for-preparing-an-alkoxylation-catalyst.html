PROCESS FOR PREPARING ALKOXYLATION CATALYST<br>
AND ALKOXYLATION PROCESS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the preparation of an alkoxylation catalyst<br>
and to a process of alkoxylation using the thus prepared catalyst.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF PRIOR ART<br>
Alkoxylated esters and compounds containing active hydrogen atoms<br>
such as alcohols, find utility in a wide variety of products, e.g., surfactants.<br>
Generally, an alkoxylation reaction involving a compound having an active<br>
hydrogen is conducted by the condensation of an alkylene oxide using a suitable<br>
catalyst. Because of the nature of the reaction, a mixture of product species is<br>
obtained having a rather wide range of molecular weights.<br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 4,775,653; 4,835,321; 4,754,075; 4,820,673; 5,220,077;<br>
and 5,627,121, all of which are incorporated herein by reference for all purposes,<br>
disclose the use of a calcium-based catalyst in the alkoxylation of various<br>
compounds such as alcohols and carboxylated compounds, e.g., esters.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to a preferred aspect of the present invention, an alkoxylation<br>
catalyst of improved activity is produced. Additionally, catalysts prepared<br>
according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention exhibit greater<br>
stability vis-a-vis settling of slurried catalyst particles. Further, alkoxylation<br>
catalysts according to preferred embodiments of the present invention, block<br>
unwanted growth of ethyoxlated alcohols in the catalyst which results in reduced<br>
formation of high molecular weight ethylene oxide adducts in the resulting<br>
products produced using the catalysts, and thereby reduces visual haze.<br>
In accordance with a particularly preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, an alkoxylation catalyst is prepared by reacting a catalyst precursor<br>
comprising an ethoxylated alcohol and a dispersed alkaline earth metal<br>
compound, with propylene oxide under conditions to propoxylate at least a<br>
portion of the ethoxylated alcohol.<br>
In another preferred aspect of the present invention there is provided a<br>
process for alkoxylating compounds having active hydrogen atoms, e.g., alcohols<br>
and carboxylated compound, e.g., esters, using a catalyst prepared in<br>
accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The catalysts of the present invention are based on the unexpected<br>
finding that by subjecting certain prior art alkoxylation catalysts to propoxylation<br>
conditions, surprising results with respect to catalyst activity and stability as well<br>
as an improvement in the appearance of products produced using the catalyst,<br>
are achieved. The prior art catalysts which are treated according to the process<br>
of the present invention to produce the alkoxylation catalysts of the present<br>
invention are referred to herein as "catalyst precursors."<br>
Preparation of Catalyst A<br>
One of the catalyst precursors, referred to herein as Catalyst A, is<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patents 4,775,653 ('653 Patent) and 5,220,077 ('077 Patent).<br>
As disclosed, in the '653 and '077 Patents, Catalyst A is prepared by admixing<br>
and reacting an ethoxylated alcohol mixture containing an ethoxylated alcohol<br>
having the general formula:<br>
R1-0-(C2H40)pH	I<br>
wherein R1 is an organic radical containing from about 1 to about 30 carbon<br>
atoms and p is an integer of from 1-30, an alkaline earth metal-containing<br>
compound which is at least partially dispersible in the ethoxylated alcohol<br>
mixture, an inorganic acid, and a metal alkoxide selected from compounds<br>
having the formulas<br>
II<br>
and <br><br><br>
wherein R2, R3, R4, and R5 are each a hydrocarbon radical containing from about<br>
1 to about 30, preferably from about 8 to about 14, carbon atoms. In the process<br>
of preparing Catalyst A, the alkaline earth metal compound and the ethoxylated<br>
alcohol mixture are mixed prior to addition of the metal alkoxide, the mixture<br>
being heated to a temperature and for a time sufficient to effect at least a partial<br>
exchange reaction between the alkoxide groups of the metal alkoxide and the<br>
hydroxyl groups of the ethoxylated alcohol.<br>
The ethoxylated alcohols used can be prepared by methods well known in<br>
the art for preparing ethylene oxide adducts of alcohols. The ethoxylated alcohol<br>
mixture used in preparing Catalyst A typically contains free alcohol, the amount<br>
and type of which will vary depending upon the source of the ethoxylated<br>
alcohol. Generally speaking, the ethoxylated alcohol mixture will contain from<br>
about 1 % to about 60% by weight free alcohol.<br>
The alkaline earth metal compound used is one which is at least partially<br>
dispersible in the ethoxylated alcohol. As used herein, the term "dispersible"<br>
refers to a compound which solublizes or otherwise interacts with the ethoxylated<br>
alcohol in such a manner that it becomes a new species of alkaline earth metal<br>
compound. It is to be understood, however, that inasmuch as the mechanism is<br>
not completely understood, the term "dispersible" or "soluble" is not intended to<br>
be limited to the formation of a truly dissolved alkaline earth metal species as<br><br>
would be commonly understood in the case of ordinary solublization. While<br>
compounds such as calcium and strontium hydride, calcium and strontium<br>
acetate, calcium and strontium oxalate, etc. may be used, it is preferred that the<br>
alkaline earth metal compound be calcium or strontium oxide, calcium or<br>
strontium hydroxide, calcium or strontium hydride or a mixture thereof.<br>
The inorganic acids useful include the acids themselves as well as "acid<br>
salts". Thus, non-limiting examples of inorganic acids include sulphuric acid,<br>
hydrochloric acid, hydrofluoric acid, phosphoric acid, pyrophosphoric acid,<br>
ammonium biflouride, ammonium sulfate, etc. Particularly preferred are the oxy<br>
acids, such as sulphuric acid.<br>
In preparing Catalyst A relative amounts of the various components can<br>
vary widely. For example, the mol ratio of the alkaline earth metal compound to<br>
the metal alkoxide can vary from about 1:1 to about 10:1, based on alkaline<br>
earth metal compound and metal of the alkoxide, respectively. The mol ratio of<br>
the inorganic acid to the metal alkoxide can vary from about 0.25:1 to about 4:1,<br>
based on the ratio of the acid equivalent e.g. acid hydrogens, in the inorganic<br>
acid to the metal of the alkoxide, respectively. It is generally preferred that the<br>
combined concentration of the alkaline earth metal compound, the inorganic acid<br>
and the metal alkoxide be present in an amount of from about 1 to about 10% by<br>
weight, the ethoxylated alcohol and diluents such as free alcohol being present<br>
in an amount of from about 90-99% by weight. As noted, depending on the<br>
source and type of the ethoxylated alcohol, free alcohol content can range from<br>
about 1 % by weight to about 60% by weight.<br><br>
Generally speaking, the order of addition of the various components of<br>
Catalyst A is immaterial with the exception that the alkaline earth metal<br>
compound must be added prior to addition of the metal alkoxide. Thus, although<br>
it is common practice to admix the ethoxylated alcohol, the alkaline earth metal<br>
compound and the inorganic acid, followed by the addition of the metal alkoxide,<br>
the process can also be carried out by reversing the order of addition of the<br>
metal alkoxide and the inorganic acid.<br>
In addition to the above components Catalyst A can contain, with<br>
advantage, organic acids. Suitable organic acids are those carboxyiic acids<br>
which have greater miscibility in hydrocarbon solvents than in water. Such<br>
carboxyiic acids, which may generally be considered fatty acids, have a carbon<br>
chain length versus acid functionality which provides their greater miscibility or<br>
solubility in hydrocarbons. Non-limiting examples of fatty acids include those<br>
natural or synthetic mono-functional carboxyiic acids wherein the carbon chain<br>
length is greater than about 5 carbon atoms, generally from about 5 to about 15<br>
carbon atoms. Specific examples of such suitable acids include hexanoic,<br>
octanoic, nonanoic, 2-ethyl hexanoic, neodecanoic, isooctanoic, stearic,<br>
napthanoic, and mixtures or isomers of such acids. While it is preferred that the<br>
acids, if used, be saturated, they may optionally contain other functional groups<br>
such as hydroxyl groups, amine groups, etc. which do not interfere with the<br>
process. It has been found that the use of the fatty acids leads to a better<br>
dispersion of the alkaline earth metal compound and that the active catalyst<br>
suspension is more stable in terms of the solids remaining dispersed.<br><br>
In preparing Gatalyst A, a typical ethoxylated alcohol is admixed with a<br>
suitable alkaline earth metal containing compound such as calcium oxide and<br>
the mixture stirred for a suitable period of time until at least some of the calcium<br>
compound disperses or solublizes in the ethoxylated alcohol. Generally, this is accomplished by stirring, or other means of agitation to achieve intimate and<br>
thorough contact, at a temperature of generally from about 25°C to about 150°C<br>
(usually below the boiling point of the ethoxylated alcohol) for a sufficient period<br>
of time. The dispersion time can vary from about 0.5 hours to about 20 hours.<br>
Longer times can be used if desired. Once the dispersion has been formed, as<br>
evidenced, e.g., by the presence of titratible alkalinity, the inorganic acid is then<br>
slowly or incrementally added. The metal, e.g., aluminum alkoxide is then added<br>
and stirring of the mixture continued and the mixture heated to a temperature<br>
and for a sufficient period of time to effect at least a partial exchange reaction<br>
between the alkoxide groups of the metal alkoxide and the hydroxyl group of the<br>
ethoxylated alcohol.<br>
The precise temperature to which Catalyst A is heated will, of course,<br>
depend upon the nature of the components employed. However, as noted<br>
above, the heating is usually carried out at a temperature and for a period of time<br>
sufficient to effect at least a partial exchange reaction between the alkoxide<br>
groups of the metal alkoxide and the hydroxyl group of the ethoxylated alcohol.<br>
This point can generally be determined by the evolution of alcohol which distills<br>
out of the mixture. It is preferred that the heating be carried on until the mixture<br>
has reached a substantially constant boiling point. The desired activation<br><br>
teWHQistyreBtsib6aitrf.....for a given pressure, approximate the boiling point of a<br>
substantial fraction of the free alcohols derived from the R2, R3.and R4 group of<br>
the metal alkoxide. At this point, maximum exchange has likely occurred<br>
between the alkoxide groups of the metal alkoxide and the hydroxyl group of the<br>
ethoxylated alcohol. It will be recognized that when the metal alkoxide utilized is<br>
one where R2, R3, R4 and R5 are long chain, e.g. 10 to 14 carbon atoms and<br>
longer, the alcohols produced in the exchange reaction are high boiling.<br>
Accordingly, very little if any distillation of alcohol occurs without the application<br>
of extremely high temperatures which can cause unwanted side reactions! In<br>
such cases, the heating can be carried out to a temperature of about 190°-<br>
300°C and more preferably from about 230°-260°C Lower temperatures may be<br>
employed when the process is conducted under reduced pressure, e.g. at a<br>
pressure of about 150-300 Torr, temperature in the range of about 160°C to<br>
about 210°C are suitable. The desired temperature range can be determined by<br>
sampling the dispersion as it is being heated at various times during the heating<br>
cycle and subjecting the samples to an ethoxylation reaction. When the desired<br>
degree of activity is achieved in the ethoxylation reaction, heating can be<br>
discontinued. Generally, however, the time of heating can vary from about 0.1<br>
hour to about 5 hours, generally in the range of from about 0.2 hour to about 1<br>
hour.<br><br>
^KapaptiQniiofe ©atafest B<br>
As detailed in U.S. Patent 5,627,121, another catalyst precursor referred<br>
to herein as Catalyst B is formed by reacting an ethoxylated alcohol mixture, a<br>
alkaline earth metal compound that is at least partially dispersible in the<br>
ethoxylated alcohol mixture and a carboxylic acid. The ethoxylated alcohols<br>
useful in forming Catalyst B are the same as those defined by Formula 1.<br>
The ethoxylated alcohol mixture used can be prepared by methods well<br>
known in the art for preparing alkylene oxide adducts of alcohols. Alternately, the<br>
alkylene oxide adducts can be prepared according to the process of the present<br>
invention. The ethoxylated alcohol mixture used in preparing Catalyst B typically<br>
contains free alcohol, the amount and type of which will vary depending upon the<br>
source of the ethoxylated alcohol. Generally speaking, the ethoxylated alcohol<br>
mixture will contain from about 1 % to about 60% by weight free alcohol.<br>
The alkaline earth metal compounds used in preparing Catalyst B are as<br>
described above with respect to Catalyst A.<br>
The carboxylic acids used in preparing Catalyst B are as described above<br>
with respect to Catalyst A.<br>
The inorganic acids that are useful in preparing Catalyst B are those as<br>
described above with respect to Catalyst A.<br>
The relative amounts of the various components can vary widely, and in<br>
general, are defined above with respect to Catalyst A.<br>
In forming Catalyst B, the ethoxylated alcohol mixture, the alkaline earth<br>
metal compound, the carboxylic acid, and the neutralizing acid are reacted or<br><br>
combined'winder.conditions that prevent any significant loss of water that is either<br>
initially present or formed during the reaction. Preventing loss of water is typically<br>
accomplished by conducting the reaction at a low enough temperature, e.g.,<br>
room temperature, to prevent loss of water. Alternately, if the reaction is<br>
conducted at elevated temperatures, super-atmospheric pressure can be used to<br>
prevent loss of water. Preferably, the reaction is conducted at elevated<br>
temperatures under reflux to prevent loss of water.<br>
In a preferred method of forming Catalyst B, the alkaline earth metal<br>
compound, e.g., calcium hydroxide, and the ethoxylated alcohol mixture are<br>
charged into a suitable stirred vessel equipped with a reflux condenser, following<br>
which the carboxylic acid is added. Generally, the three components are mixed<br>
at room temperature, although higher temperatures can be used. This reaction<br>
mixture is then heated generally to a temperature of from about 30° to 45°C for<br>
a period of time sufficient to solubilize the calcium-containing compound.<br>
Generally speaking, the reaction mixture is reacted for a period of from about 0.5<br>
to about 2 hours. Following solubilization of the calcium compound, a mineral<br>
acid, e.g., sulfuric acid, is introduced into the reaction mixture in an amount<br>
sufficient to neutralize at least 25% of the titratable alkalinity present in the<br>
reaction mixture. The reaction mixture can optionally be sparged with an inert<br>
gas such as nitrogen.<br>
As noted above, to prepare the catalysts of the present invention, a<br>
suitable catalyst precursor, e.g., Catalyst A or Catalyst B, described above, is<br>
reacted with propylene oxide under propoxylation conditions to effect at least<br><br>
©EQCiQxviatioQ: ■ofeia.ibteast a portion of the ethoxylated alcohols present in the<br>
catalyst precursor. The formula of ethoxylated alcohols present in either of the<br>
catalyst precursors is given by Formula i above. Following propoxylation<br>
according to the process of the present invention, there is produced an<br>
ethoxylated/propoxylated alcohol having the formula<br>
R1-0-(C2H40)p-(C3H60)tH	IV<br>
wherein t is from 1 to .15, preferably from 1 to 10, more preferably from 1 to 7.<br>
Particularly preferred ethoxylated/propoxylated species coming within Formula IV<br>
which are useful in the present invention are those wherein R1 contains from 8 to<br>
14 carbon atoms, p is from 2 to 6 and t is from 1 to 3, most preferably from 1 to<br>
1.5. It will be understood that, as in the case of all alkoxylated species of<br>
alcohols, there is a distribution of the alkoxy groups, the numbers above referring<br>
to the average number of ethoxy/propoxy groups present in the alkoxylated<br>
species.<br>
In general the catalysts of the present invention are prepared by reacting<br>
one of the catalyst precursors with the desired amount of propylene oxide in a<br>
standard alkoxylation reactor. Generally the propoxylation reaction is conducted<br>
at a temperature from 95 to 200 °C and from 15 to 75 psig propylene oxide<br>
pressure.<br>
To more illustrate the present invention, the following non-limiting<br>
examples are presented. In the following example, the following procedure was<br>
employed to prepare the catalyst, e.g., Catalyst A or Catalyst B:<br><br>
Example 1<br>
85 gram portions of catalyst precursors were separately subjected to<br>
propylene oxide addition in the standard alkoxylation reactor at a temperature of<br>
120 to 150 °C and a pressure of 40 to 50 psig propylene oxide (PPO) so as to<br>
result in the addition of 1.0 to 1.5 mols of propylene oxide. The thus prepared<br>
catalysts were compared with Catalyst A and Catalyst B, i.e., the catalyst<br>
precursor, to determine activity. The catalyst samples were tested for activity on<br>
the basis of time to effect addition of a given amount of ethylene oxide to an<br>
ALFOL® 12 alcohol, a alcohol marketed by Sasol North America, Inc. In ali<br>
cases, the amount of catalyst employed was 0.1 wt. %.<br>
Table 1 below shows the results using the various catalyst in preparing an<br>
ethoxylated C12 alcohol containing 7 mols of ethylene oxide. In Table 1, in all<br>
cases, the catalysts according to the present invention contained 1 mol of<br>
propylene oxide as indicated by Catalyst A + 1 PPO,. Catalyst B + 1 PPO, etc.<br><br><br>
|Iabte::2ibelaw«stiows results for the addition of two mols of ethylene oxide<br>
xo tne C12 alcohol.<br><br>
As can be seen from the data in Table 1 and Table 2, the addition of<br>
propylene oxide to either Catalyst A or Catalyst B results in improved activity of<br>
the respective catalyst.<br>
Example 2<br>
This Example demonstrates the effect of adding different levels of<br>
propylene oxide to the catalyst precursors in terms of catalyst stability, i.e., the<br>
ability of the catalyst to remain as a generally homogeneous' dispersion over a<br>
period of time. The procedure of Example 1 was followed with respect to the<br>
propoxylation of Catalyst B. Samples of propoxylated Catalyst B containing 0.5,<br>
1.0 and 1.5 mols of PPO, respectively, were prepared and compared with<br>
unpropoxylated Catalyst B. In general, after periods of 1 week, 2 weeks, and 3.5<br>
weeks, all of the propoxylated samples exhibited greater stability, i.e., remained<br>
better dispersed than the non-propoxylated Catalyst B. This dispersion<br>
improvement was not noticed with respect to similarly propoxylated samples of<br>
Catalyst A.<br><br>
The procedure of Example 1 was followed with respect to determining the<br>
effect of propoxylation of the catalyst precursors vis-a-vis ethoxylation activity<br>
with the exception that the alcohol employed was Safol™ 23, an essentially linear<br>
C12-13 binary alcohol marketed by Sasol North America, Inc. In all cases, 7<br>
mols of ethylene oxide were added to the alcohol. The results comparing<br>
Catalyst B and a catalyst according to the present invention are shown in Table 3<br>
below.<br><br>
As can be seen from Tables 3 and 4 in the case of the propoxylated<br>
Catalyst B (Table 3) at low levels of propoxylation (0.5 mols) the activity of the<br>
catalyst was enhanced. However, as the amount of propylene oxide addition<br>
increased, catalyst activity decreases as compared to the unmodified<br>
(unpropoxylated) catalyst precursor.<br><br>
.W;itb' -ResReQilQ Table 4, it can be seen that increasing amounts of<br>
propoxylation increase the activity of the propoxylated modified Catalyst A,<br>
amounts of propylene oxide addition of greater than about 1 mol rendering the<br>
resulting catalyst more active.<br>
Example 3<br>
The procedure of Example 1 was followed in terms of preparing 7 mol<br>
ethoxylates of the Safol™ 23 alcohol. Both in the case of propoxylated Catalyst<br>
A and B, it was found that from 1.0' to 1.5 mols of propylene oxide added<br>
resulted in less residual catalyst haze. It was also noted with respect to Catalyst<br>
A propoxylated at the 0.5 mol level that there appeared to be an increase in haze<br>
of the ethoxylated product.<br>
As can be seen from the above results, the process of the present<br>
invention provides alkoxylation catalysts that, as compared to prior art<br>
aikoxylation catalysts, exhibit greater activity, are more stable, and produce a<br>
product with less haze. As the data above demonstrates, depending upon the<br>
catalyst precursor and the desired results, e.g., catalyst activity versus haze in<br>
the end product, the amount of propylene oxide added to the catalyst precursor<br>
is tailored.<br>
Modifications of the compositions, procedures and conditions disclosed<br>
herein that will still embody the concept of the improvements described should<br>
readily suggest themselves to those skilled in the art, and are intended to be<br><br>
■encOTioassed with to fee spirit of the invention presently disclosed herein as well<br>
as the scope of the appended claims.<br><br>
