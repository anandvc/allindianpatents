				<td>THERMOPLASTIC POLYMER FILM SEALING OF NOZZLES ON<br>
FLUID EJECTION DEVICES AND METHOD<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
The present invention generally relates to the sealing of nozzles on<br>
fluid ejection devices, and more particularly, to thermoplastic polymer films<br>
sealing the nozzles of fluid ejection devices.<br>
Over the past decade, substantial developments have been made in<br>
the micro-manipulation of fluids in fields such as electronic printing technology<br>
using inkjet printers. The ability to maintain a viable releasable seal of both<br>
input and output nozzles or channels in such products is very desirable.<br>
One of the major problems of maintaining a robust seal to micro fluidic<br>
channels is the ability, during shipping, handling, and storage, to prevent fluid<br>
from leaking out of the channel as well as preventing external material from<br>
clogging or entering the channel. The desirable attributes of a seal for micro<br>
fluidic channels include the prevention of evaporation, contamination, and<br>
intermixing of fluids between channels. In addition, the ability to remove the<br>
seal while minimizing the amount of residue left on the input and/or output<br>
nozzles or channels is also desirable. Further, it is also desirable that the seal<br>
is materially compatible with the fluid (i.e. the seal is not degraded over time<br>
by the fluid).<br>
An inkjet print cartridge provides a good example of the problems<br>
facing the practitioner in sealing micro fluidic channels. There is a wide<br>
variety of highly-efficient inkjet printing systems currently in use, which are<br>
capable of dispensing ink in a rapid and accurate manner. Conventionally,<br>
the loss of ink and or clogging of the ink ejection nozzles is prevented by<br>
either using a capping device or by using a pressure sensitive tape (PSA)<br>
(see for example US Patent No. 5,414,454) in most of these systems.<br>
However, there is a corresponding need for improved sealing technologies, as<br>
inkjet-printing systems continue to provide ever-increasing improvements in<br>
speed and image quality.<br>
Fluid ejection cartridges typically include a fluid reservoir that is<br>
fluidically coupled to a substrate that is attached to the back of a nozzle layer<br>
containing one or more nozzles through which fluid is ejected. The substrate<br>
normally contains an energy-generating element that generates the force<br>
necessary for ejecting the fluid held in the reservoir. Two widely used energy<br>
generating elements are thermal resistors and piezoelectric elements. The<br>
former rapidly heats a component in the fluid above its boiling point causing<br>
ejection of a drop of the fluid. The latter utilizes a voltage pulse to generate a<br>
compressive force on the fluid resulting in ejection of a drop of the fiuid.<br>
In particular, improvements in image quality have led to both a<br>
decrease in the size of the nozzles as well as the complexity of ink<br>
formulations that increases the sensitivity of the cartridge to residue. Smaller<br>
nozzles are more susceptible to plugging from any residue left in a nozzle<br>
region when the seal is removed. Nozzles are also more susceptible to<br>
clogging from residue left on the nozzle layer that is swept into a nozzle by a<br>
service station wiper when the nozzle layer is cleaned. In addition,<br>
improvements in image quality have led to an increase in the organic content<br>
of inkjet inks that results in a more corrosive environment experienced by the<br>
material sealing the nozzles. Thus, degradation of the sealing material by<br>
more corrosive inks raises material compatibility issues. In addition,<br>
improvement in print speed has typically been gained by utilizing a larger<br>
printhead resulting in an increased print swath. The larger printhead results in<br>
a larger number of nozzles to be sealed and thus the need to maintain a leak<br>
tight seal over a greater area.<br>
Conventional capping devices typically seal the inkjet nozzles using a<br>
mechanical structure to apply pressure to a compliant material (typically an<br>
elastomeric or resilient foam material), that is pressed or forced against the<br>
nozzles resulting in a seal. These devices, however, can suffer leakage<br>
during shipping, handling, and storage due to vibration, rough handling,<br>
temperature and humidity fluctuations etc., which can result in clogged<br>
nozzles or spillage of ink in the cartridge container. This problem is<br>
exacerbated when it occurs in ink cartridges containing multiple inks, resulting<br>
in ink mixing that typically produces poor color rendition when printed.<br>
Although conventional capping materials can be more compatible with the<br>
newer aggressive or corrosive inks, the increased print swath increases the<br>
likelihood of leaks due to thermal expansion and the bending properties of<br>
both the printhead and the capping device.<br>
Conventional PSA tapes on the other hand typically seal the inkjet<br>
nozzles using a pressure sensitive adhesive. The PSA tape is generally<br>
constructed of a base film with an acrylate based pressure sensitive adhesive<br>
layer used to seal the nozzles as shown schematically in Fig. 1. The base<br>
film is normally made of polyethylene terephthalate commonly referred to as<br>
polyester (PET) or polyvinyl Chloride (PVC). The use of thin PSA tapes has<br>
resulted in improving the resistance to environmental variation due to<br>
dimensional changes caused by temperature and humidity excursions. PSA<br>
tapes have also provided some improvement in durability in regards to<br>
vibration, thus, improving upon some of the problems associated with capping<br>
devices. However, a PSA tape applied over an irregular surface, such as a<br>
protrusion, a stepped structure or a discontinuous surface, can result in the<br>
gradual peeling or lifting of the PSA tape resulting in leakage, especially over<br>
longer periods of time. The gradual lifting can also result in the formation of<br>
an air pocket between the tape and the nozzle plate, allowing ink to flow into<br>
this region which will then react or corrode materials such as the encapsulant<br>
that protects the electrical traces. Ultimately this may lead to electrical shorts<br>
and the print cartridge may fail.<br>
As noted above and shown in a simplified isometric view in Fig. 1 most<br>
PSA tapes generally consist of a base film 11 and an adhesive layer 21 with a<br>
liner 31 and/or release layer 41 (typically polydimethylsiloxane {PDMS}).<br>
During application the liner 31 is removed and discarded. The adhesive layer<br>
21 is bonded to the nozzle layer, using pressure, forming a seal. The<br>
adhesive layer is typically an elastomer mixture with large quantities of small<br>
molecular additives having a low molecular weight. The additives typically<br>
include plasticizers, tackifiers, polymerization catalysts, and curing agents.<br>
These low molecular weight additives are added primarily to change the glass<br>
transition temperature (Tg) of the material and to provide tack.<br>
Since these additives are low in molecular weight compared to the<br>
polymer molecular weight they can both be leached out of the adhesive layer<br>
by the ink, react with ink components, or both, more easily than the polymer<br>
backbone. In either case, whether the low molecular weight material reacts<br>
with, or is leached out by the ink, the adhesive layer of the PSA tape is left<br>
with a weakened cohesive strength which can result in a residue being left<br>
behind when the tape is removed. In addition, the reaction between these low<br>
molecular weight additives and ink components can also lead to the formation<br>
of precipitates or gelatinous materials, which can further result in clogging of<br>
the nozzles.<br>
The interaction of these low molecular weight additives and the ink<br>
components can also give rise to a weakening of the base/adhesive film<br>
interface. Thus, if the strength of this interface is sufficiently degraded, the<br>
adhesive layer of the tape can remain on the print cartridge when the user<br>
attempts to pull the tape off before inserting the cartridge into the printer. The<br>
material compatibility of both the base film as well as the adhesive film is<br>
carefully chosen for each ink. The material compatibility of the ink/additive<br>
interactions as well as the general ink/polymer interactions should be<br>
considered.<br>
Regardless of the method used to eject the fluid, once a fluid ejection<br>
cartridge is manufactured, filled with fluid, and tested there is a need to seal<br>
the nozzle or nozzles to prevent leakage, reduce evaporation of the fluid, and<br>
to hinder contamination of the fluid. Thus, practitioners are often faced with<br>
difficult choices between capping devices (greater ink robustness); PSA tapes<br>
(better sealing properties) and changes in ink formulation to meet the<br>
shipping, handling, and storage requirements for a particular fluid ejection<br>
cartridge.<br>
Thus a sealing system that prevents fluid leakage, evaporation,<br>
contamination, and intermixing between channels, as well as being easily<br>
removable while minimizing the residue left on a variety of nozzle plates and<br>
is compatible with a variety of inks would be an advance in the art.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

nozzle and a fluid reservoir containing an ejectable fluid, fluidically coupled<br>
with the at least one nozzle. The fluid ejection cartridge has a tape that<br>

the nozzles.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
A feature of the present invention includes the use of a thermoplastic<br>
polymer film that maintains the sealing properties of a PSA tape while also<br>
maintaining the ink robustness of a capping device. By using higher sealing<br>
temperatures and pressures along with minimizing the use of additives, the<br>
practitioner is able to optimize the ink formulation and the sealing properties of<br>
the thermoplastic polymer film. Thus the present invention advantageously<br>
uses a thermoplastic polymer film optimized for ink compatibility and also<br>
utilizes higher sealing temperatures and pressures to form a robust seal<br>
around the nozzles of a fluid ejection cartridge.<br>
The thermoplastic polymer film can be a thermoplastic crystalline or<br>
semi-crystalline polymer or a thermoplastic elastomer that has a melting point<br>
greater than about 35°C; preferably a melting point from about 60°C to about<br>
150 C. particularly preferable is a melting point from about 70°C to about<br>
120C. The thermoplastic polymer film has little or no tack at room<br>
temperature. In addition, the thermoplastic polymer film also preferably has a<br>
melt index of from about 0.5 to about 5.0 g/min according to the American<br>
Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standard D1238, and more<br>
preferably a melt index of from about 0.5 to about 1.0 g/min. However, a<br>
thermoplastic polymer film having a melt index in the range of from about 0.5<br>
to about 50 g/min can be utilized. The thermopiastic polymer film has the<br>
advantages of being mechanically strong, resistant to a wider range of fluids<br>
than PSA's, contains little or no additives, and typically has lower water vapor<br>
transmission rates than PSA's. In addition, the thermoplastic polymer film<br>
conforms well around abrupt structural features on the fluid ejection device.<br>
More importantly, the thermoplastic polymer film provides the ability to tune<br>
the adhesion properties by using different sealing temperatures, pressures,<br>
and times, thus optimizing the sealing properties for different fluid ejection<br>
cartridges.<br>
Referring to Fig. 2, an exemplary embodiment of a fluid ejection<br>
cartridge 220 of the present invention is shown in a perspective view. In this<br>
embodiment, the fluid ejection cartridge 220 includes a reservoir 228 that<br>
contains a fluid which is supplied to a substrate (not shown) that is secured to<br>
the back of a nozzle layer 226. The substrate (not shown), the nozzle layer<br>
226, nozzles 224, and a flexible circuit 222 form what is generally referred to<br>
as an ejector head. In those embodiments which do not utilize an integrated<br>
nozzle layer and flexible circuit the substrate, the nozzle layer and the nozzles<br>
would generally be referred to as the ejector head.<br>
The nozzle layer 226 contains one or more nozzles 224 through which<br>
fluid is ejected. The nozzle layer 226 may be formed of metal, polymer, glass,<br>
or other suitable material such as ceramic. Preferably, the nozzle layer 226 is<br>
formed from a polymer such as polyimide, polyester, polyethylene naphthalate<br>
(PEN), epoxy, or polycarbonate. Examples of commercially available nozzle<br>
layer materials include a polyimide film available from E. I. DuPont de<br>
Nemours &amp; Co. under the trademark "Kapton", a polyimide material available<br>
from Ube Industries, LTD (of Japan) under the trademark "Upilex", and a<br>
photoimagible epoxy available from MicroChem Corp. under the trademark<br>
NANO SU-8. In an alternate embodiment, the nozzle layer 226 is formed<br>
from a metal such as a nickel base enclosed by a thin gold, palladium,<br>
tantalum, or rhodium layer.<br>
The flexible circuit 222 of the exemplary embodiment is a polymer film<br>
and includes electrical traces 242 connected to electrical contacts 240. The<br>
electrical traces 242 are routed from the electrical contacts 240 to bond pads<br>
on the substrate (not shown) to provide electrical connection for the fluid<br>
ejection cartridge 220. When the flexible circuit 222 and nozzle layer 226 are<br>
integrated as shown in Fig. 2, raised encapsulation beads 244 (typically an<br>
epoxy) are dispensed within a window formed in the integrated flexible circuit<br>
222 and nozzle layer 226. The encapsulation beads 244 protect and<br>
encapsulate the electrical trace 242 and bond pad electrical connections on<br>
the substrate. In an alternate embodiment, when nozzle layer 226 is not<br>
integrated into flexible circuit 222 the encapsulation beads 244 are dispensed<br>
along the edge of nozzle layer 226 and the edge of the substrate to provide<br>
the protection function for the electrical connections to the substrate.<br>
Once the manufacture of the fluid ejection cartridge is complete and<br>
the reservoir 228 is filled with fluid, and the appropriate testing of the fluid<br>
ejection cartridge is completed the nozzles 224 should then be sealed to<br>
prevent leakage and/or to prevent contamination of the fluid. The tape 200<br>
shown in Fig. 2 is initially provided on a roll, cut to the appropriate length, and<br>
aligned with the fluid ejection cartridge 220 such that the tape 200 will fully<br>
cover the nozzles 224. The tape 200 is then pressed onto the fluid ejection<br>
cartridge 220 in the direction of arrow 201 using a heated platen (not shown)<br>
to heat the thermoplastic polymer film 202 above its melting temperature and<br>
to apply pressure. The thermoplastic polymer film 202 is heated to above its<br>
melting temperature, preferably 10°C to 50"C above the melting temperature<br>
and more preferably 25°C to 50°C above the melting temperature. The tape<br>
200 may also be provided with a non-sticking tab 230, commonly referred to<br>
as a pull-tab, to facilitate gripping of the tape 200 by the user for removal.<br>
The tape 200 shown in a perspective view in Fig. 2 is a two-layer<br>
construction where the thermoplastic polymer film 202 is adhesively bonded<br>
to the base film 204. Preferably, the base film 204 is a polyester (PET) film.<br>
Other polymer film materials may also be used for the base film such as<br>
polyvinyl chloride, polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), polyethylene naphthalate<br>
(PEN) polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), polyurethane, polyamide,<br>
polyarylates. and polyester based liquid-crystal polymers. The base film 204<br>
can also be a woven or non-woven base, where a non-woven base is a flat<br>
porous sheet typically produced by interlocking layers or networks of fibers,<br>
filaments, or film-like filamentary structures. The non-woven base is<br>
specifically designed to allow thorough penetration of the impregnating resin<br>
inside the very porous base film. Materials commonly used to make non-<br>
woven sheets are polyesters, polypropylene, and rayon.<br>
Although the thickness of the base film 204 will depend both on the<br>
particular fluid ejection cartridge being sealed and the particular thermoplastic<br>
polymer film used, the thickness of the base film 204 preferably ranges from<br>
about 5 to about 500 microns and more preferably from about 5 to about 50<br>
microns thick and particularly preferable is a range from about 10 to about 25<br>
microns thick. It is also preferable that the base film 204 has a melting<br>
temperature at least 10°C higher than that of the thermoplastic polymer film<br>
202, more preferable at least 25°C higher, and particularly preferable is a<br>
melting temperature at least 50°C higher.<br>
The thermoplastic polymer film 202 preferably is ethylene-based binary<br>
or ternary copolymers. Examples of such copolymers include ethylene-vinyl<br>
acetate copolymers with a vinyl acetate content between from about 0 to<br>
about 40 weight percent, and more preferably with a vinyl acetate content<br>
between from about 10 to about 25 weight percent. Another example is<br>
copolymers of ethylene-methacrylic acid with a methacrylic acid content<br>
between from about 5 to about 30 weight percent, and more preferably a<br>
methacrylic acid content between from about 10 to about 20 weight percent.<br>
Another example is ethylene-vinyl acetate-methacrylic acid terpolymers, and<br>
ethylene-acrylic ester-glycidyl methacrylate terpolymers. A particularly<br>
preferable semi-crystalline ternary copolymer film contains from about 60 to<br>
about 95 weight percent polyethylene, and from about 0 to about 40 weight<br>
percent polyvinyl acetate, and from about 0 to about 30 weight percent<br>
polymethacrylic acid. The acid groups in the copolymer can be partially<br>
neutralized. Other materials may also be used for the thermoplastic polymer<br>
films such as polyurethanes, polyamide, and polyester. Blends of these<br>
polymers, such as EVA/PP or EVA/PE, can also be utilized.<br>
Although the thickness of the thermoplastic polymer film 202 will<br>
depend both on the particular fluid ejection cartridge being sealed and the<br>
particular thermoplastic polymer film used the thickness of the thermoplastic<br>
polymer film 202 preferably ranges from about 5 to about 500 microns and<br>
more preferably from about 10 to about 100 microns thick and particularly<br>
preferable is a range from about 25 to about 75 microns thick. It is also<br>
preferable that the thermoplastic polymer film 202 has a melting temperature<br>
around from about 60°C to about 150°C, and more preferably from about 70°C<br>
to about 120°C, however, films with melting temperatures above about 35°C<br>
can be utilized.<br>
It is preferable that the thermoplastic polymer film 202 contains less<br>
than about 10 percent low molecular weight additives, having molecular<br>
weights less than about 2000 grams per mole, such as plasticizers, tackifiers,<br>
and also be halogen free. It is more preferable that the thermoplastic polymer<br>
film 202 not contain low molecular weight additives. However, thermoplastic<br>
polymer films that contain less than from about 20 to about 30 weight percent<br>
low molecular weight additives can be utilized. Examples of various<br>
compounds that can be used as processing agents are adipates, such as di-<br>
2-ethylehxyl adipate; phosphates, such as 2-ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate;<br>
phthalates, such as diisotridecyl phthalate or di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate;<br>
secondary plasticisers, such as sorbitan sesquioleate, epoxidised linseed or<br>
soybean oils; slip and antiblock agents such as oleamide, erucamide, and<br>
stearamide, and other similar materials.<br>
As noted above an advantage of the present invention is the ability to<br>
adjust the adhesion of the thermoplastic polymer film 202 to the nozzle layer<br>
226, by varying the temperature, pressure, and time during application. In<br>
addition, the adhesion can also be adjusted by varying the crosslinking<br>
density of the polymer or polymers used in the thermoplastic polymer film 202.<br>
Although the degree of crosslinking of the thermoplastic polymer film 202 will<br>
depend on the particular fluid ejection cartridge being sealed, the particular<br>
thermoplastic polymer film used, as well as the particular fluid used in the fluid<br>
ejection cartridge, preferably the degree of crosslinking is controlled by<br>
electron beam irradiation in the range of from about 0 to about 30 mrad, which<br>
can result in more than an order of magnitude variation in peel strength, and<br>
more preferably in the range of from about 0 to about 10 mrad. Other<br>
crosslinking technologies such as chemical or ultraviolet light (UV) activated<br>
systems, or other electromagnetic radiation activated systems can be used as<br>
well.<br>
The adhesion between the base film 204 and the thermoplastic<br>
polymer film 202 can also be adjusted by pretreating the base film 204 before<br>
application of the thermoplastic polymer film. Preferably, either plasma<br>
treating or corona discharge treating of the base film 204 with a reactive gas<br>
such as oxygen is used. However, other surface treatments such as laser,<br>
flame, chemical, or by applying a coupling agent can also be utilized.<br>
An alternate embodiment of the present invention is shown in Fig. 3<br>
where tape 300 is a single layer construction formed from the thermoplastic<br>
polymer film 302. In this embodiment, the thermoplastic polymer film can be<br>
any of the polymers described for the embodiment shown in Fig. 2. Although<br>
the thickness of the thermoplastic polymer film 302 will depend both on the<br>
particular fluid ejection cartridge being sealed and the particular thermoplastic<br>
polymer film used the thickness of the thermoplastic polymer film 302 is from<br>
about 20 to about 500 microns thick and more preferably from about 25 to<br>
about 175 microns thick, and particularly preferable from about 115 to about<br>
135 microns thick. In addition, in this embodiment, preferably heat is applied<br>
to the tape from the fluid ejection cartridge side using either hot air or infrared<br>
heating to form a surface melted region during application without melting the<br>
entire film.<br>
Fig. 4a shows an alternate embodiment of the present invention is<br>
shown in a cross-sectional view. In this embodiment, a tape 400 is a three<br>
layer construction where a thermoplastic polymer film 402 is adhesively<br>
bonded to a moisture barrier film 406 that is adhesively bonded to a base film<br>
404 Both the base film 404 and thermoplastic polymer film 402 can be any of<br>
the polymers respectively described for the embodiment shown in Fig. 2.<br>
Although the total thickness of the tape 400 will depend both on the particular<br>
fluid ejection cartridge being sealed and the particular thermoplastic polymer<br>
film used, preferably the total thickness is in the range from about 20 to about<br>
150 microns, and more preferably in the range from about 25 to about 100<br>
microns in thickness, and particularly preferable is the range from about 25 to<br>
about 75 microns. Although Fig. 4a depicts a construction with the moisture<br>
barrier film 406 sandwiched between the base film 404 and the thermoplastic<br>
film 402 it is equally preferable that the base film 404 is sandwiched between<br>
the moisture barrier film 406 and the thermoplastic polymer film 402.<br>
depending on the particular materials used for the moisture barrier film 406.<br>
Preferably, the moisture barrier film 406 is polyethylene, however,<br>
other materials can be utilized such as liquid crystal polymers, and even a<br>
metal or inorganic layer can be used. Although the thickness of the moisture<br>
barrier layer will depend both on the particular fluid ejection cartridge being<br>
sealed and the materials used for both the base film 404 and the<br>
thermoplastic polymer film 402 a range from about 0.01 to about 25 microns is<br>
preferable, a range from about 0.5 to about 15 microns is more preferable.<br>
A second alternate embodiment of the present invention is shown, in a<br>
cross-sectional view, in Fig. 4b. In this embodiment, the tape 400' is a four<br>
layer construction where a thermoplastic polymer film 402' is adhesively<br>
bonded to a moisture barrier film 406' that is adhesively bonded to a base film<br>
404' that is adhesively bonded to an electrostatically dissipating film 408. The<br>
base film 404', the thermoplastic polymer film 402', and moisture barier film<br>
406' can be any of the polymers respectively described for the embodiments<br>
shown in Fig. 2 or Fig. 4a. In addition, the moisture barrier film 406' and<br>
electrostatically dissipating film 408, depending on the particular films used,<br>
can act as a base film thereby replacing the base film 404'. Although the<br>
thickness of the tape 400' will depend both on the particular fluid ejection<br>
cartridge being sealed and the particular thermoplastic polymer film 402' used<br>
the thickness of the tape 400' preferably ranges from about 20 to about 150<br>
microns, and more preferably from about 25 to about 100 microns, and<br>
particularly preferable is a range from about 25 to about 75 microns. Although<br>
Fig 4b depicts a construction with the moisture barrier film 406' sandwiched<br>
between the base film 404' and the thermoplastic film 402' with the<br>
electrostatically dissipating film 408 that is adhesively bonded to the<br>
remaining free side of the base film 404', other constructions are equally<br>
preferable as long as the thermoplastic polymer film 402' is bondable to the<br>
nozzle layer as shown in Fig. 2. For example, the electrostatically dissipating<br>
film 408 can also be sandwiched between the base film 404' and the<br>
thermoplastic polymer film 402'.<br>
Preferably, the electrostatically dissipating film 408 is treated<br>
polyethylene with a surface resistivity from about 109 to about 1013<br>
ohms/square, however, other materials can be utilized such as carbon black<br>
filled polymers, and even a metal formed on the surface of the electrostatically<br>
dissipating film 408. Although the thickness of the electrostatically dissipating<br>
film 408 will depend both on the particular fluid ejection cartridge being sealed<br>
and the materials used for both the base film 404' and the thermoplastic<br>
polymer film 402' a range from about 0.5 to about 25 microns is preferable.<br>
For those fluid ejection devices that contain sensitive circuitry to protect, such<br>
as complimentary metal oxide semiconductors (CMOS), electrostatically<br>
dissipating film 408 preferably has a surface resistivity of 104 ohms per<br>
square. The electrostatically dissipating film 408 preferably contains a static<br>
dissipating material such as the treated polyethylene to control triboelectric<br>
charging and a conductive layer such as a thin metal layer to act as a shield<br>
against electrostatic fields.<br>
Referring to Fig. 4c, a third alternate embodiment of the present<br>
invention is shown in a cross-sectional view. In this embodiment, the tape<br>
400" is a five layer construction where a thermoplastic polymer film 402" is<br>
adhesively bonded to an air barrier film 410; the air barrier film 410 is<br>
adhesively bonded to moisture barrier film 406"; the moisture barrier film 406"<br>
is adhesively bonded to a base film 404"; and the base film 404" is adhesively<br>
bonded to an electrostatically dissipating film 408". The base film 404", the<br>
thermoplastic polymer film 402", and moisture barrier film 406" and the<br>
electrostatically dissipating film 408' can be any of the polymers respectively<br>
described for the embodiments shown in Fig. 2 or Figs. 4a - 4b. Preferably,<br>
the air barrier film 410 is a liquid crystal polymer film; however, other materials<br>
such as metal layers or inorganic layers (e.g. silicon dioxide, aluminum oxide<br>
etc ) can also be used.<br>
Although the thickness of the tape 400" will depend both on the<br>
particular fluid ejection cartridge being sealed and the particular thermoplastic<br>
polymer film 402" used the thickness of the tape 400' preferably ranges from<br>
about 20 to about 500 microns, and more preferably from about 25 to about<br>
100 microns, and particularly preferable is a range from about 25 to about 75<br>
microns. Although Fig. 4c depicts a construction with the moisture barrier film<br>
406" and the air barrier film 410 sandwiched between the base film 404" and<br>
the thermoplastic film 402" with the electrostatically dissipating film 408' that is<br>
adhesively bonded to the remaining free side of the base film 404", other<br>
constructions are equally preferable as long as the thermoplastic polymer film<br>
402" is bondable to the nozzle layer as shown in Fig. 2.<br>
An exemplary method of releasably sealing the nozzles of a nozzle<br>
layer on a fluid ejection cartridge using a tape as described in the various<br>
embodiments shown in Figs. 2 - 4 is shown as a flow diagram in Fig. 5. At<br>
step 530 the tape is dispensed from a reel that holds the tape during<br>
manufacturing. The tape is advanced off the reel by a combination of a drive<br>
roller and an idler roller that keeps the tape in proper tension and alignment<br>
preventing both twisting and slacking or drooping. At step 532 as the tape is<br>
advanced off the reel the tape is fed into a heating zone to preheat the tape<br>
such that the downstream process of attaching the tape to the fluid ejection<br>
cartridge can be sped up resulting in the ability to maximize throughput.<br>
Preferably, the tape is preheated to a temperature in the range of from about<br>
10 C to about 50°C above the melting temperature of the thermoplastic<br>
polymer film, and more preferably from about 25°C to about 50°C, however,<br>
depending on the particular tape being utilized preheating temperatures<br>
higher than about 50°C above the melting temperature can be used.<br>
The tape is then releasably captured in step 533 using a vacuum chuck<br>
that can be moved in three mutually perpendicular directions to properly<br>
position the tape over the fluid ejection cartridge as shown in Fig. 6. After the<br>
tape has been releasably captured, a pull-tab is attached to the free end of<br>
the tape to facilitate gripping of the tape by the user for removal. A cutter or<br>
slitting device then cuts the tape to its required length in step 535.<br>
The vacuum chuck that releasably captures the tape in step 533 also<br>
includes a heater that heats the tape in step 536 to a sufficiently high<br>
temperature to facilitate attaching the tape to the nozzle surface layer shown<br>
in Fig. 2. Preferably, the heater heats the tape to a temperature in the range<br>
of from about 110°C to about 125°C within from about 2 to about 7 seconds,<br>
however, other temperatures and times can also be utilized depending on the<br>
particular fluid ejection cartridge, tape used and manufacturing tooling utilzed.<br>
As the heater of the vacuum chuck is heating the tape, the vacuum chuck also<br>
positions the tape over the fluid ejection cartridge to cover the nozzle or<br>
nozzles in step 537.<br>
Once the cut tape is both positioned correctly and the tape is at the<br>
desired temperature, the vacuum chuck attaches the tape to the fluid ejection<br>
cartridge in step 538. In this step, preferably a pressure of from about 30 to<br>
about 60 psi is applied between the tape and the fluid ejection cartridge, and<br>
more preferably in the range of from about 40 to about 50 psi, however<br>
pressures in the range of from about 7 to about 100 psi can also be used<br>
depending on the particular fluid ejection cartridge and tape being utilized. In<br>
addition, the particular pressure used in step 538 also depends upon other<br>
factors such as, the flatness of the vacuum chuck, the flatness of the pen<br>
surface to which the tape is being laminated, the durometer of a compliant<br>
material if used on the vacuum chuck, and the parallelism of the two surfaces<br>
during lamination. In step 539, the user removes the tape at room<br>
temperature before utilizing the fluid ejection cartridge.<br>
Referring to Fig. 6 an alternate embodiment of the method of<br>
releasably sealing the nozzles of a nozzle layer on a fluid ejection cartridge<br>
using a tape as described in the various embodiments shown in Figs. 2 - 4 is<br>
shown as a perspective view. More particularly, the alternate embodiment<br>
shown in Fig. 6 shows an alternate method of heating the tape before<br>
attaching the tape to the fluid ejection device. In this embodiment, the<br>
vacuum chuck 656 is similar to that described above in steps 533 through<br>
538 The vacuum chuck includes a heater 652 attached to the heater support<br>
654. Attached to the heater 652 is a compliant material 650 that is preferably<br>
a silicone rubber, however, other compliant materials that can operate in the<br>
desired temperature range can also be used. The compliant material contains<br>
at least one hole though which a vacuum is applied to hold tape 60C in a<br>
substantially flat manner. Preferably, complaint material contains a plurality of<br>
holes to hold the tape 600 in its proper position. In this embodiment surface<br>
heater 656 is positioned to heat both the nozzle surface layer of the fluid<br>
ejector head 622 and the sealing surface 603 of the thermoplastic polymer<br>
film layer of tape 600.<br>
The fluid ejector head is attached to fluid reservoir 628 to form fluid<br>
ejection cartridge 620 similar to fluid ejection cartridge 220 shown in Fig. 2.<br>
This embodiment is particularly advantageous for the tape embodiment<br>
shown in Fig. 3 where the tape 600 is a single layer construction where it is<br>
desirable to melt only the surface of the thermoplastic polymer film. As shown<br>
in Fig. 6 surface heater 656 heats the two surfaces by using hot air or some<br>
heated inert gas such as nitrogen or argon. However, other heating methods<br>
can be utilized such as infrared heating, microwave heating, and laser<br>
heating.<br>
Referring to Figs. 7a - 7b an alternate embodiment of the method of<br>
releasably sealing the nozzles of a nozzle layer on a fluid ejection cartridge<br>
using a tape as described in the various embodiments shown in Figs. 2 - 4 is<br>
shown in a perspective view. More particularly, the alternate embodiment<br>
shown in Figs. 7a - 7b shows a method to attach tape 700, to the nozzle layer<br>
(not shown) using a first portion 705 of the tape 700; to the reservoir 728<br>
using a second portion 706 of the tape 700; and to the electrical traces 742<br>
and electrical contacts 740 using a third portion 707 of the tape 700. This is<br>
particularly advantageous for those fluid ejection cartridges 720 that have<br>
electrical contacts and traces in close proximity to the fluid ejection nozzles.<br>
In this embodiment, vacuum chuck 756 stakes the tape 700 to the<br>
nozzle layer (not shown) using the first portion 705, similar to that described in<br>
step 538 shown in Fig. 5, by heating tape 700 and applying pressure to the<br>
base film 704 resulting in the thermoplastic film 702 sealing the nozzles in the<br>
nozzle layer. As shown in Fig. 7b a second laminator 790 or vacuum chuck<br>
756 rotated ninety degrees, then preferably laminates the second portion 706<br>
of the tape 700 to the reservoir 728, and laminates the third portion 707 over<br>
the electrical traces 742 and electrical contacts 740; providing a robust seal<br>
for the nozzles, the electrical traces 742 and electrical contacts 740, leaving<br>
the pull tab 730 free to facilitate gripping of the tape 700 by the user for<br>
removal. In an alternate embodiment the second portion 706 is laminated to<br>
reservoir face 708 using a third laminator (not shown) or vacuum chuck 756<br>
rotated minus ninety degrees.<br>

Evaluation methods<br>
The fluid ejection cartridge employed for the testing has 6 columns of<br>
nozzles on about 8x8 mm area of a metal orifice plate. Each column has 72<br>
nozzles. The cartridge was filled with a water-based fluid containing different<br>
colors such as cyan, magenta, and yellow typically with each color contained<br>
in a separate chamber. The composition of the fluid was 5 to 10 weight<br>
percent 2-pyrrolidone, 6 to 8 weight percent 1,5 pentanediol, 6 to 8 weight<br>
percent trimethylolpropane (2-ethyl-2-hydroxymethyl-1,3-propanediol), and 0<br>
to 2 weight percent butanol or isopropanol. The nozzles of the filled cartridge<br>
were then sealed with one of the tapes in the manner described the Examples<br>
1-10. The fluid ejection cartridges with the tapes sealing the nozzles were<br>
exposed to 60°C for two weeks in an accelerated aging tester to evaluate:<br>
1. Fluid leakage<br>
The fluid ejection cartridges with the tapes sealing the nozzles were<br>
inspected for fluid leakage after the accelerated aging test at 60 °C for two<br>
weeks. A simple scale was used to rank the risk of the fluid leakage. The<br>
ranking "low" denotes that the fluid was confined in the nozzle bores or<br>
around the nozzle rings under the tape. The ranking "medium" denotes that<br>
the fluid was observed to leak and encompass more than one nozzle under<br>
tape but does not cross the nozzle columns. The ranking "high" denotes that<br>
fluid leakage was observed and the fluid not only encompasses the nozzles<br>
but also crosses the nozzle columns.<br>
2 Peel force<br>
The 180-degree peel test was performed to remove the tape from the<br>
nozzle layer of a fluid ejection cartridge at a peel rate of 10 inches per minute.<br>
Results were taken as grams of peel force per millimeter width of the tape<br>
(g/mm).<br>
3. Adhesive transfer<br>
After the tape removal, the nozzle layer was observed for transferred<br>
tape adhesives. The symbol "yes" denotes that the tape adhesive was<br>
observed on the nozzle layer surface and the "no" denotes that no such<br>
adhesive transfer was observed.<br>
Example 11<br>
Thermoplastic polymer film tape 11 was prepared in the same manner as tape<br>
3 except that the tape was crosslinked using a 5 mrad electron beam dose.<br>
Example 12<br>
Thermoplastic polymer film tape 12 was prepared in the same manner as tape<br>
3 except that the tape was crosslinked using a 7.5 mrad electron beam dose<br>
Example 13<br>
Thermoplastic polymer film tape 13 was prepared in the same manner as tape<br>
3 except that the tape was crosslinked using a 10 mrad electron beam dose.<br>
Example 14<br>
Thermoplastic polymer film tape 14 was prepared in the same manner as tape<br>
3 except that the tape was crosslinked using a 12.5 mrad electron beam dose.<br>
Example 15<br>
Thermoplastic polymer film tape 15 was prepared in the same manner as tape<br>
3 except that the tape was crosslinked using a 15 mrad electron beam dose.<br>
Example 16<br>
Thermoplastic polymer film tape 16 was prepared in the same manner as tape<br>
3 except that the tape was crosslinked using a 17.5 mrad electron beam dose.<br>
Tapes 11-16 were heated to about 120°C and attached to the nozzle layer of<br>
a fluid ejection cartridge with a pressure of 45 psi. The fluid ejection<br>
cartridges with the tapes sealing the nozzles were exposed to 60°C for two<br>
weeks in an accelerated aging tester and then peel tested using the process<br>
described above. A graph of the peel strength of the various tapes as a<br>
function of electron beam dosage is shown in Fig. 8. The change in peel<br>
strength as a function of electron beam dosage demonstrates the ability to<br>
further tune the adhesion force of the thermoplastic polymer film to the nozzle<br>
layer via crosslinking density.<br>
The present invention advantageously uses a thermoplastic polymer<br>
film optimized for ink compatibility and also utilizes higher sealing<br>
temperatures and pressures to form a robust seal around the nozzles of a<br>
fluid ejection cartridge. The thermoplastic polymer film is preferably either a<br>
thermoplastic crystalline or semi-crystalline polymer or a thermoplastic<br>
elastomer. The thermoplastic polymer film has the advantages of being<br>
mechanically strong, resistant to a wider range of fluids than PSA's, contains<br>
little or no additives, and typically has lower water vapor transmission rates<br>
than PSA's. In addition, the thermoplastic polymer film conforms well around<br>
abrupt structural features on the fluid ejection device. The thermoplastic<br>
polymer film also provides the ability to tune the adhesion properties by using<br>
different sealing temperatures, pressures, and times, thus optimizing the<br>
sealing properties for different fluid ejection cartridges.<br>
