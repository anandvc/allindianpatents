The invention relates to a hydrophobic precipitated silica featuring extremely low water absorption, a high level of whiteness, and properties of low thickening in silicone rubber formulations with a high reinforcing action in the silicone vulcanizates,<br>
The treatment of finely divided solids, metal oxides, and silicates with organosilicon compounds, such as organopolysiloxanes, is known, for example, from DE 30 85 905. The heat treatment process this entails is carried out under an inert atmosphere of nitrogen-Additionally, hydrophobic silicates are known, for example, from DE 24 35 860, DE 22 42 728, and DE 25 13 608.<br>
In these documents, hydrophilic silicates and precipitated silicas are hydrophobicized by reacting them with organosilicon compounds. Examples of hydrophobicizers used include organohalosilanes and organopolysiloxane compounds.<br>
DE 26 28 975 and DE 27 29 244 describe preparing hydrophobic silicas by reacting a hydrophilic precipitated silica featuring low water absorbency with silicone oil or dimethyldichlorosilane, respectively. In the process according to DE 26 28 975, the reaction is carried out with the hydrophobicizer (silicone oil) being added to the dry precipitated silica; in the process according to DE 27 29 244, the hydrophobicizer (dimethyldichlorosilane) is introduced directly into the precipitated silica suspension. In both cases, the hydrophobicizing step is followed by heat treatment at elevated temperatures, specifically between 200 and 400Â°C.<br><br>
A disadvantage of this process is that the precipitated silica thus hydrophobicized becomes discolored at the required process temperatures. The discoloration of this silica is particularly inconvenient when it is added to silicone formulations; that is, when these hydrophobic precipitated silicas are added to silicone rubber formulations or to defoamer mixtures based on silicone oil.<br>
As a measure of the discoloration it is possible to use the value known as reflectance. In measuring the reflectance, the diffuse reflection power of a sample is investigated. The higher the diffuse reflection power of a sample, the higher its reflectance and thus the higher the whiteness of the sample.<br>
Precipitated silicas generally have a reflectance of not more than 97%. One object of the present invention is therefore to hydrophobicize silicas in such a way that, ideally, the reflectance of the original silica is retained-<br>
Discoloration occurs in particular when the precipitated silicas are strongly hydrophobicized; that is, have a high methanol wettability and high carbon loadings. It is precisely these properties, however, which are in many cases (in silicone rubber formulations, for example) desired.<br>
A further disadvantage of the known processes is that only a limited amount of hydrophobicizer can be attached covalently to the silica. Particularly in silicone rubber formulations, however, high carbon loadings are desired, since they permit decisive improvements in the rheological properties, such as the thickening, i.e., low yield point and low viscosity, of the compounds.<br><br>
As a measure of the thickening, it is possible to utilize the DBP number. The DBP number indicates the absorption capacity of a silica for DBP. The measurement technique shows the amount of dibutyl phthalate, in g, on a sample of 100 g, at which a massive increase in force in the compounder is observed.<br>
It is also not possible to achieve high carbon loadings by using diorganodichlorosilanes, or hydrolysis products of diorganodichlorosilanes, or with corresponding diorganopolysiloxanes in excess to the silanol groups present, since the totality of the organosilicon compounds is no longer attached covalently to the silica. In hydrophobicized silicas for fractions of hydrophobic!zing agent that has net been covalently attached, there is a risk that these molecules may have a marked mobility, which in many applications can be very detrimental {e.g,, in silicone rubber applications for medical purposes or for articles that are safe in food contact, such as pacifiers, etc.).<br>
A further disadvantage of the prior art processes is that the relatively low carbon contents of less than 3.1% lead to hydrophobic silicas which have a strong thickening action in silicone rubber formulations. DE 26 28 975 lists data on the testing of hydrophobic precipitated silica in silicone rubber formulations, in which the hydrophobic precipitated silica is used in increasing weight fractions. From these it is clear that, at a level of just 15% of hydrophobic silica in the rubber, the self-leveling properties of the silica disappear and that, at 20%, flowable compounds are no longer obtained. All tables clearly indicate that all of the mechanical properties are improved as the filler content goes up. It would therefore be desirable to prepare silicone rubber formulations which include high<br><br>
fractions of hydrophobic silicas, for improving the mechanical properties, but which at the same time are still flowable.<br>
It was therefore an object of the present invention to provide a precipitated silica which has a high, covalently attached carbon loading, low water absorption, a low-thickening effect with good reinforcer properties in silicone rubber formulations, and a high level of whiteness. It has surprisingly been found that a hydrophobic silica having the required properties can be obtained by distributing a polysiloxane on a hydrophilic silica with subsequent conditioning and oxidative heat treatment.<br>
The present invention accordingly provides hydrophobic precipitated silicas characterized by the following properties:<br><br>
The ranges of preference specified may be adjusted independently of one another.<br>
The hydrophobic silicas of the invention may additionally, each independently of one another, be characterized by the following properties:<br><br>
-	Sears number	
-	pH	5-9<br>
-	water content	
-	conductivity	
-	loss on ignition	&gt;3%<br>
The conductivity	may be below 100, 60, 30, or even<br>
20 ÂµS.<br>
The present invention further provides a process for preparing hydrophobic precipitated silicas, comprising the following steps:<br>
a)	preparing  a  mixture  of  an  organopolysiloxane derivative and a precipitated silica,<br>
b)	conditioning the mixture at from 10 to 150Â°C for a period of from 0.5 to 72 h, and<br>
c)	conducting oxidative heat treatment at more than 300Â°C with an oxidizing gas.<br>
The hydrophobic precipitated silica of the invention features the following properties:<br>
an extremely high whiteness  (reflectance above<br>
94%)<br>
no discoloration in air even at temperatures above<br>
300Â°C<br>
an extremely low moisture absorption, at the same<br>
level as pyrogenic silicas<br>
a highly homogeneous hydrophobicization, i.e., a<br>
steep methanol wettability curve<br>
high methanol wettability {&gt;60%)<br>
high level of firmly attached carbon (&gt;3.1%)<br>
low thickening action in silicone rubber<br>
contains virtually no ionic impurities, i.e., low<br>
conductivity 
contains no surfactants,  emulsifiers or organic<br>
solvents which might  lead to discoloration at<br>
elevated temperatures.<br><br>
The process for preparing the silica of the invention makes it possible to obtain homogeneous distribution of the hydrophobicizer while avoiding the use of solvents (except for water), emulsifiers, surfactants or other surface-active molecular moieties in the hydrophobicizer, so that the resulting silica combines low-thickening properties with absence of discoloration.<br>
The effective distribution of the hydrophobicizer and the high degree of hydrophobicization of the precipitated silica of the invention result in silicone rubber formulations, for example, in very low thickening, unimpaired even by prolonged storage, in conjunction with good mechanical and optical properties in the vulcanizates-<br>
The silica of the invention is preferably prepared with a polysiloxane, so that after heat treatment its only organic radicals are methyl groups, this going hand in hand with a very high thermal load-bearing capacity (&gt;3 00Â°C with ingress of air does not lead to discolorations).<br>
The process of the invention makes it possible to effect hydrophobicization particularly of silicas with a low silanol group density (the measure used for the amount of silanol groups is the Sears number, i.e., the alkali consumption of an acid-based titration; together with the BET surface area it is then possible to compare silanol group densities relatively) and to achieve a high whiteness (&gt;94% reflectance) in the resulting silica of the invention.<br>
The water absorption of the hydrophobic precipitated silica of the invention, which is very low for a precipitated silica, is made possible by the selection of a hydrophilic precipitated silica with a very low<br><br>
silanol group density and through very homogeneous hydrophobicization with organosilicon compounds. The measure used for the silanol group density is the Sears number in proportion to the BET surface area.<br>
The reaction conditions employed in the process of the invention do not lead to carbonization and thus lead to virtually no discoloration. For this reason it is important that the hydrophilic base silica contains no organic impurities, since otherwise the discoloration increases. Since the cleavage products which form as a result of the heat treatment, and which are gaseous under the process conditions, may bring about a certain degree of discoloration even in an oxidizing atmosphere, it is important to remove these cleavage products from the product by means of a sufficient throughput of gas.<br>
The use of liquid polysiloxane, preferably the polydimethylsiloxane of preferably 30-100 cSt, permits optimum distribution on the base silica. Under the oxidative reaction conditions, the polydimethyl-siloxanes used are able to undergo resinification. This has the great advantage that the hydrophobicizer can be distributed on the silica in liquid form and then fixed. The amount of bound carbon can be greatly increased by the oxidative heat treatment.<br>
Silicas of the invention exhibit steep methanol wettability curves; in other words, homogeneous hydrophobicization has taken place (Fig. 1) . Fig. 2 shows the methanol wettability of customary hydrophobic silicas heat-treated without the conditioning of the invention.<br>
High carbon loadings and high methanol wettabilities bring about decisive improvements in the properties of silicas in silicone rubber formulations. The further<br><br>
reduction in moisture absorbency permits vulcanizations at atmospheric pressure and at temperatures above 100Â°C in silicone rubber formulations, since no disruptive vapor bubbles  appear  in the vulcanizate.  The high carbon  content  silicas  of  the  invention  exhibit substantially  improved  rheological  properties   in silicone rubber formulations; that is, they have only a low thickening action, and exhibit low yield points. This low thickening action makes it possible to prepare flowable silicone rubber formulations which are filled with well above 20% of hydrophobic precipitated silica and yet can still be processed by injection molding. Additionally,  the  higher  filling  level  leads  to markedly  improved  mechanical  properties  in  the vulcanizates.<br>
The hydrophobic precipitated silica of the invention may therefore be used in the following applications:<br>
1.   As a filler in silicone rubber formulations<br>
The silica of the invention can be used without further hydrophobicization in all types of silicone rubber. The low water absorption suppresses evolution of vapor in high temperature crosslinking systems such as LSR and HTV silicone rubber, and allows pore-free vulcanizates. The low DBP number leads to low compound viscosities, which can be used to advantage in LSR and RTV2 compounds. The compounds possess a high level of stability on storage: the phenomenon referred to as afterstiffening is suppressed. Because of the low moisture absorption, the silica of the invention can also be used in systems which cure by atmospheric humidity such as RTVl compounds. The compounds likewise have a high level of stability on storage. Since the moisture content of the silica of the invention is greatly reduced.<br><br>
the   unwanted  hardening  during   storage   is suppressed.<br>
Because of the high whiteness of the silica, attractive white vulcanizates can be produced. The low water absorption of the silica results in low moisture absorption in the vulcanizates. This produces high electrical resistance and an increase in aging stability, especially at high temperatures. These properties are particularly useful in electrical insulators and in seals.<br>
2.   As a defoamer component<br>
It is known, for example, from DE 28 29 906, US 4 377 493, DE 34 11 759, US 4 344 858, and WO 95/058 80 that hydrophobicized silicas can be used in defoamer formulations. Advantageous for high-level defoamer performance here are the high hydrophobicity and a high surface area, readily accessible even to relatively large molecules, of the silica of the invention. The high hydrophobicity of the silica of the invention, furthermore, ensures high alkali resistance and results in much higher service lives particularly in strongly alkaline media.<br>
The high reflectances of the silicas of the invention ensure appealing defoamer formulations free from discoloration, particularly in formulations based on mineral oil and silicone oil.<br>
3.   As a free-flow agent<br>
It is known (for example, from Degussa AG brochure series, Fallungskieselsauren und Silikate [Precipitated silicas and silicates], 1984) that hydrophobicized silicas can be used as free-flow auxiliaries. Because of its low water absorption.<br><br>
the silica of the invention is particularly suitable as a free-flow auxiliary for substances that are sensitive to hydrolysis. Here again, the high reflectances of the silicas of the invention are an additional advantage.<br>
The silica of the invention may also be used as a carrier substance, particularly for insecticides, as an insecticide per se, has an antiblocking auxiliary, or filler in silicone rubber mixtures which cure by atmospheric humidity.<br>
The hydrophobic precipitated silicas of the invention are prepared in three steps:<br>
first of all, a liquid polysiloxane derivative is initially distributed, physically, on the silica surface. Where this initial distribution is carried out in aqueous media, i.e., suspensions or silica with a water content of more than 70%, the silica is typically unstable. It must therefore be isolated quickly by filtration following the initial distribution, and/or subjected to accelerated drying (in a spin-flash drier or nozzle tower drier, for example). This conserves the distribution of the organopolysiloxane droplets on the silica and prevents separation into water, silicone oil, and silica.<br>
Subsequently, in a controlled conditioning step -process step b) - the distribution of the hydrophobicizer is improved further and engagement of the polysiloxane derivative with the silica surface is achieved. This state of distribution is stable even in aqueous media. Following process step b), there is no longer any separation between the polysiloxane derivative and the silica. At carbon contents &gt;3.1, the conditioned silicas can<br><br>
be adjusted steplessly to a methanol wettability of up to 55%. The BET/CTAB ratio after this step is 
This is followed by a heat treatment in an oxidizing atmosphere, which suppresses discoloration phenomena, ensures covalent binding of the hydrophobicizing agent, and - probably as a result of the formation of gaseous cleavage products - increases further the distribution of the hydrophobicizer, Heat treated silicas, with a lower carbon content than the corresponding conditioned silica, have a higher methanol wettability. Heat treatment in an oxidizing atmosphere assists the resinification of the polysiloxanes, so that much larger amounts of hydrophobicizer can be anchored covalently on the silica. The BET/CTAB ratio has turned around and is now &gt;1.<br>
As the organopolysiloxane derivative it is possible to use all organosilanes or organohalosilanes which are commonly used to hydrophobicize precipitated silicas.<br>
Step  a)  of  the  process  of  the  invention  can be<br>
conducted with the following variants:<br>
Addition of organopolysiloxane derivative to a precipitated silica having a water content of from 1.0 to 80% by weight, preferably from 20 to 60% by weight.<br>
Addition of the organopolysiloxane derivative to a dispersion of the precipitated silica, i.e., following precipitation of silicate with an acid, for example, using a Rhein-Hlitte mixer or Kotthof-<br><br>
MischsIrene or Ultra-Turrax. This necessitates rapid filtration and/or accelerated drying (spin-flash drier, spray drier, nozzle tower) after the reaction.<br>
Addition of the organopolysiloxane derivative to a precipitated silica having a water content of from 70 to 99% by weight, with subsequent isolation of the  solid  from  the  water-  Isolation  can  be effected by filtration, nozzle tower, spin-flash, or other accelerated drying. The higher the water content,  the more quickly isolation should be carried out. Separation should be avoided. Simultaneous supplying of the precipitated silica or  hydrous  silica  and  the  organopolysiloxane derivative to a spin-flash drier.<br>
Mixing   of   dry   precipitated   silica   with polysiloxane, in a Gericke mixer, for example.<br>
An alternative possibility is first to prepare a masterbatch, i.e., a conditioned precipitated silica, obtained according to process steps a) and b) , and to mix it with a (hydrophilic) , hydrous precipitated silica (e.g., filtercake, silica suspension or silica dispersion).<br>
The  water  content  of  the  hydrophilic  precipitated silica may vary within the ranges mentioned above.<br>
The base silica may be coated in a mass ratio, for example, of from 1:1 to 1:3 with silicone oil, e.g, DOW CORNING (R) 200 FLUID 50 CS (50 mPas dimethyl-polys iloxane terminated with trimethylsilyl groups, carbon content of approximately 33%) (step a) ) . The resulting powder is conditioned at a temperature of more than lOOÂ°C for half an hour, for example. The conditioning (step b) here is carried out until the resulting material is wettable by water (methanol wettability 
 <br>
wettability see the measurement technique section) but which when introduced into water no longer exhibits any separation between silica and silicone oil (if step c) follows  directly  on  from  step  b) ,  a  methanol wettability  &gt;20  is  preferred)â¢  Mixing  of  this masterbatch,  (e.g.,  50%  by weight  silica  and  50% silicone oil) with aqueous silica dispersions or silica suspensions  produces  stable mixtures  in  which  the silicone oil no longer separates from the silica. The total mixture typically contains one part by weight of silicone oil, about 4-8 parts by weight of silica, and 20-60 parts by weight of water. In order to prepare such a suspension, for example, the masterbatch (e.g., 50%  silica  and  50%  silicone  oil)  can  be  mixed thoroughly  with  about  10-16  times  the  amount  of filtercake (solids content approximately 20%) and about 10-20  times  the  amount  of  additional  water.  The advantage of this procedure is that the water-wettable masterbatch (which contains up to 75% of hydrophobic organo  polysilcxane)  can  be  dispersed  directly  in silica precipitation suspensions or silica feeds, very finely and stably, without the need to use emulsifiers or surfactants. After such a mixture has been dried, or filtered  and  then  dried,  the  organopolysiloxane-containing silica  thus  obtained can be  conditioned again (step b).<br>
These steps can be carried out individually, where appropriate with grinding beforehand. Grinding should not, however, be carried out before coating a) . It is also possible to carry out two or more of these variants - that is, identical or different variants -in succession. The following embodiments of the process of the invention are conceivable:<br>
One of steps a), b), and c) is performed a number of times (from 2 to 5 times) in succession.<br><br>
steps a) and b) are carried out a number of times (from 2 to 5 times) in succession.<br>
All steps a), b), and c) are carried out a number of times (from 2 to 5 times) in succession; in other words, the process is run through a number of times.<br>
Process step b) is preferably carried out by heat treatment at 100-150Â°C over the course of from 0.5 to 2 hours. After conditioning, the partly hydrophobicized silica present may have a methanol wettability of 20% or more. Fundamentally, a distinction may be made between wet and dry hydrophobicization.<br>
Wet hydrophobicization means that the silicate starting materials are aqueous silica suspensions, silica feeds, or high water content silica filtercakes, which are coated with the corresponding hydrophobicizers, as described, for example, in DE 27 29 244 for precipitation suspensions with organohalosilanes.<br>
Dry hydrophobicization means that the silicate starting materials are silica powders with different moisture contents of from 1 to 75%, which are coated with the corresponding hydrophobicizers. This process is described, for example, in DE 26 28 975.<br>
The silica of the invention is prepared using organopolysiloxane derivatives; it is, however, also possible to use other silicone compounds which react to give organopolysiloxanes under the chosen reaction conditions (for example, dichlorodimethylsilane in an aqueous environment).<br>
Hydrophobicizing reagents used comprise organopolysiloxane derivatives or their precursors, for example, those with the composition R4-nSiXn (where n = 1, 2, 3), [SiRxXyO] (where 0<x></x><br><br>
Preference is given to linear polysiloxanes having the composition SiRnXm[SiRxXyO] zSiRoXp (where 0^n
Particular preference is given to polysiloxanes having the composition SiRnXm[SiRxXyO] zSiRoXp (where 0 
Because of the presence of certain functional groups in organopolysiloxane derivatives, salts or low molecular mass substances such as NH3, amines, alcohols, etc. may be formed, which can lead to disruptive impurities. An<br><br>
important exception here is constituted by s i land-functional i zed polysiloxanes, since the only impurity formed here is water, which is easy to remove under the chosen process conditions.<br>
With preference, the hydrophobicizer may comprise a methyl-terminated polydimethylsiloxane, in particular one having a viscosity of 30-100 mPas, preferably 40-60 mPas - An example of a suitable polysiloxane oil is DOW CORNING (R) 200 FLUID 50 CS-<br>
Since the aforementioned hydrophobicizers are compounds of low volatility, an important part in the initial distribution of the hydrophobicizers on the silica surface is played by capillary forces and diffusion events at the liquid/solid phase boundary.<br>
Even if the hydrophobicizers used with preference exhibit a certain volatility in the course of a thermal treatment, the liquid/solid distribution is still important. For this reason, a distinction is made here between physical, initial distribution, conditioning, and heat treatment.<br>
The heat treatment, i.e., process step c) , is conducted at at least 300Â°C, preferably above 350Â°C, with very particular preference above 360-370Â°C, with an oxidizing gas. This gas can be air, CO2, NOx (NO2, NaOs^ NO, N2O) , O3, O2, Br2, F2, or a mixture of these gases with further inert gases such as C02, N2 or burner waste gases, in each case preferably at not less than 1% by volume.<br>
Additionally, the oxidizing gas may optionally contain up to 80%, preferably up to 50%, with particular preference 20-40%, by volume of water.<br><br>
In every case, a good gas throughpur must Be ensured as far as possible, the gas must reach every silica particle. Apparatus suitable for ensuring this includes, for example, metal lattice ovens, muffle furnaces, or belt reactors.<br>
In a muffle furnace, the bed height should be from 1 to 2 cm.<br>
It is possible to combine two or more of these types of reactor. The process may be operated batchwise or continuously.<br>
By way of example, the text below gives further details of the conditions in a belt reactor and in a muffle furnace.<br>
Heat treatment of a granule bed (in a belt reactor) Heat treatment takes place with relatively high process gas throughputs (&gt;5 TO?/ [h-kg], energy input via the process gases) through a bed of polysiloxane-treated silica. For this purpose, the silica must be granulated beforehand. Since the energy is supplied by way of the process gases, it is relatively easy to avoid local overheating here. Although the high process gas volumes result in a low concentration of cleavage products in the process gas, this does not result in poor hydrophobicization via the gas phase, since the concentrations of cleavage products in the granular pieces are much higher than between the granular pieces. Nevertheless, excess cleavage products can be expelled readily from the granular pieces, so that here as well it is possible to obtain high-whiteness products with optimum hydrophobicization. This reactor type can be operated safely at oxygen concentrations of 4-21%. Spherical granules are preferably of the order of 2-20 mm in size, while for rodlet-shaped granules widths of 2-20 mm and lengths of 2-40 mm are preferred.<br><br>
A bed of granules can be heat treated batchwise or continuously (in a belt reactor).<br>
The preferred heat treatment times are 0.15-3.5 h at temperatures of 320-400Â°C, for a duration of 0.15-4 h.<br>
The reactor size may range from laboratory scale (100 g range/charge) via pilot plant size (100 kg range/charge) through production scale (&gt;100 kg/charge).<br>
When using this type of reactor, the heat treatment is typically followed by grinding of the granules.<br>
Heat treatment in a muffle furnace:<br>
The polysiloxane-coated silica is heat treated preferably in flat trays with a bed height of 2 cm. Heat treatment is carried out in air. The bed height selected firstly ensures a sufficiently high concentration of cleavage products in the interior of the bed (which permits effective hydrophobicization by means of the gaseous cleavage products), but secondly permits the unhindered escape of excess cleavage products.<br>
Heat treatment in a muffle furnace may take place at 330-380Â°C for a duration of at least 15 minutes but not more than 4 hours.<br>
Following the conditioning step and/or heat treatment, the hydrophobicized silica is optionally ground. Grinding before the coating step a) , however, is not appropriate, and leads to low-grade products with inhomogeneous hydrophobicization.<br>
Optional grinding gives a silica having a d4.3 of 8-25 Âµm, preferably 8-15 m.<br><br>
The use of the precipitated silicas of the invention as a filler in silicone rubber formulations, in elastomer mixtures, polymers (e.g., PVC, polyurethanes) , tires or sealants, as defoamer auxiliaries or as free-flow auxiliaries is likewise provided by this invention.<br>
In order to develop fully their mechanical properties, silicone rubber formulations require active reinforcing fillers. It is common to use highly dispersed silicas. Because of the ease of mechanical processing of LSR (liquid silicone rubber) formulations, especially in injection molding processes, HTV (high temperature vulcanizing) silicone rubber formulations are increasingly being replaced by LSR mixtures. The reinforcing filler must bring about good mechanical properties in the vulcanizate without impairing the rheological properties of the silicone rubber formulations. After compounding, the silicone rubber formulations must be flowable and should not undergo afterstiffening even following prolonged storage times.<br>
HTV and LSR formulations are processed at temperatures well above 100Â°C. At such temperatures, hydrous fillers may lead to disruptive formation of vapor bubbles in the silicone formulation. In the case of silicone rubber formulations which cure by atmospheric humidity, an excessively high water content in the filler results in unwanted curing in the course of storage. Accordingly, the water absorption characteristics, i.e., the amounts of water adsorbed at different relative atmospheric humidities, constitutes a measure of the processability of the filler.<br>
The problem of vapor bubble formation occurs particularly with the hydrophilic precipitated silicas. Even hydrophobic precipitated silicas do not, typically, exhibit the low water absorption characteristics of the pyrogenic silicas.<br><br>
The hydrophobic precipitated silica of the invention, however, exhibits water absorption characteristics comparable with those of pyrogenic silicas, is unaffected by discoloration, and also has low-thickening properties in silicone rubber formulations,<br>
These properties are derived from the nature of the base silica used and from the nature of the hydrophobicization. The base silica is preferably a precipitated silica which has a very low silanol group density (the measure used for the silanol group density is the Sears number taken together with the BET surface area). The low silanol group density of the base silica is also manifested in a low loss on ignition of 3.0 Â± 0.5 at a BET surface area of about 160 m2/g.<br>
For silicone rubber mixtures which are processed at temperatures of almost 200Â°C with ingress of air, it is important that there are no organic constituents on the silica which might undergo discoloration under  the influence   of   oxygen   at   these   temperatures, Organosilicon compounds containing exclusively methyl, phenyl, fluorocarbon or hydrofluorocarbons as organic radicals are extremely temperature-stable even in the presence of atmospheric oxygen. In order, however, to achieve  effective  cleavage  of  the  stable  siloxane bridges  of  siloxane  compounds  and  to  bond  them covalently to the silica, temperatures above 300Â°C are required-   At   these  high  temperatures,   siloxane compounds,  especially  in  the  case  of  precipitated silicas with a low silanol group density, normally lead to discoloration phenomena on the silica. The process of the invention makes it possible to suppress this discoloration.   These  discoloration  phenomena  are measured by reflectance measurements with an optical measurement  technique  based  on  diffuse  reflection. Where the reflectances of silica are &gt;94%, the silica-<br><br>
filled silicone rubber compound appears pure white. Since the refractive indices of silica and silicone rubber are close to one another, even very small impurities and discolorations in the silica filler become clearly visible in the silicone rubber. A reflectance of 93% already leads to a marked discoloration in the silicone rubber, visible with the naked eye, despite the fact that the silica powder before incorporation appears pure white to the viewer.<br>
By mixing the silica of the invention with diorganopolysiloxanes and, where appropriate, further substances at room temperature or only slightly elevated temperature, it is possible to prepare compositions which can be cured to give elastomers, following the addition of crosslinking agents where appropriate. The silica of the invention has a low thickening effect, so that the compounds can be processed in LSR systems on injection molding machines. Mixing can be carried out conventionally, in mechanical mixers, for example.<br>
The fillers used in accordance with the invention are employed preferably in amounts of from 5 to 50% by weight, more preferably from 10 to 40% by weight, based on the overall weight of the compositions which can be cured to give elastomers- In the case of HTV organopolysiloxane elastomers it is possible to use up to 50% by weight.<br>
Besides diorganopolysiloxanes, the hydrophobicized precipitated silica of the invention, crosslinking agents and crosslinking catalysts, the compositions which can be cured to elastomers may of course where appropriate include fillers which are conventionally, often or usually, used in compositions that can be cured to elastomers. Examples of such substances are fillers having a surface area of less than 50 m^/g.<br><br>
such as quartz flour,  diatomaceous earth,  and also zirconium silicate and calcium carbonate,  and also untreated pyrogenic silica,  organic resins,  such as polyvinyl chloride powders, organopolysiloxane resins, fibrous fillers, such as asbestos, glass fibers and organic pigments, soluble dyes, fragrances, corrosion inhibitors,  agents which stabilize the  compositions against  the  influence  of  water,  such  as  acetic anhydride,   agents  which  retard  curing,   such  as benzotriazol,    and    plasticizers,     and    also trimethylsiloxy-endblocked dimethylpolysiloxanes. The    cited    combination    of    physicochemical characteristics of the hydrophobic precipitated silica of the invention results in an outstanding reinforcing filler. The equilibrium moisture content, much lower than that of the known precipitated silicas, brings advantages in processing, in the context, for example, of  vulcanization  at  atmospheric  pressure,   which produces pore-free vulcanizates in comparison with the use of the known, hydrated precipitated silicas. The optimized pH and the low DBP number lead to perceptibly reduced roller-softening times.  The  low electrolyte content in combination with the low moisture content leads ultimately to good electrical properties in the vulcanizates-<br>
In silicone rubber sealants that cure by atmospheric humidity, the low water content of the hydrophobic precipitated silica of the invention gives advantages for the storage properties of the uncured sealants.<br>
The examples which follow are intended to illustrate the present invention, without restricting its scope.<br>
Examples:<br>
As the silicate starting material, it is preferred to use precipitated silicas which possess  a very  low<br><br>
silanol group density, i.e., a low alkali consumption/BET surface area ratio, a relatively high CTAB surface area for approximately the same BET surface area, and a high level of whiteness and purity.<br>
Preparation of base silica<br>
50.0 m^ of water are charged to a reaction vessel. Slowly, 9.2 m^ of waterglass solution and 0.9 m^ of H2SO4 are added with stirring to the initial charge, an alkaline pH being maintained in the mixture during the addition. After the end of the addition of waterglass and H2SO4, the pH of the resulting suspension is within the alkaline range. The suspension is acidified and filtered, and the solid product is washed with deionized water. The hydrophilic base silica can be dried, preferably by an accelerated drying method. The following data relate to the dried precipitated silica thus obtained.<br><br>
The base silica and the polysiloxane are mixed until a defined carbon content is obtained; in other words, the mixing ratio is a function of the arithmetic proportion for setting the required carbon content.<br>
1. Measurement techniques 1.1 Methanol wettability<br><br>
Silicas whose surfaces have been modified with nonhydrolyzable organic groups are usually not wetted by water.<br>
These hydrophobic silicas can, however, be wetted by a methanol/water mixture. The fraction of methanol in this mixture - expressed as a percentage by weight - is a measure of the hydrophobicity of modified silica. The higher the methanol fraction, the better the hydrophobicization of the substance.<br>
Procedure:<br>
200 mg of each hydrophobic silica or silicate sample is weighed out  into  6  centrifuge  tubes  each with  a capacity of 15 ml, and each of the tubes is filled with 8 ml of a methanol/water mixture of ascending methanol concentration.  The  methanol  concentration  of  the mixtures  is  guided  by  the  anticipated  methanol wettability- The centrifuge tubes are tightly sealed and then shaken vigorously (10 up-and-down motions). To separate  the  wetted  silica/silicate  fractions,  the tubes are then centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 5 minutes. The wetted fractions form a sediment whose volume can be read off on the scale on the centrifuge tubes. On a graph,  the sediment volumes are plotted against the methanol/water mixture concentration. These individual points produce a curve whose position and steepness characterizes the degree of hydrophobicization of the sample under analysisâ¢<br>

1.2 DBP absorption<br><br>
The DBF absorption (DBF number), which is a measure of the absorbency of the precipitated silica, is determined as follows:<br>
The dibutyl phthalate number is determined using the Brabender plastograph. The DBF number is a measure of the absorbency of a pulverulent product for liquid. The absorbency is dependent on the moisture content, the particle size, and the amount of material analyzed.<br>
Apparatus and reagents<br>
Brabender plastograph with plotter Multi-Dosimat E 415 (50 1) from Metrohm Dibutyl phthalate<br>
Procedure<br>
12.5 g of silica are introduced into the kneader of the Brabender plastograph. With continued mixing (kneader paddle speed 125 rpm), dibutyl phthalate runs into the mixture at a rate of 4 ml/minute. The force required for incorporation is low. Toward the end of the determination, the mixture becomes poorly free-flowing. This fact is documented in an increase in the required force, which is indicated on the scale. When the scale has moved by 300, DBF metering is automatically shut off.<br>
Evaluation<br>
The density of DBF is 1.047 g/ml. The DBF absorption is based on the anhydrous, dried substance. When using precipitated silicas of relatively high moisture content, the value must be corrected using the following table if these silicas are not dried prior to the determination of the DBF number.<br><br><br><br>
The correction figure corresponding to the water content is added to the experimentally determined DBP value; for example, a water content of 5.8% would mean an add-on of 33 g/100 g for the DBP absorption.<br>
1.3	Particle size<br>
The particle size is determined using a Malvern Mastersizer in ethanol following ultrasound treatment for 5 minutes. The measurement is made automatically and provides the average particle size d4.3 from a volume distribution.<br>
1.4	Determination  of  the  tristimulus  value  Ry  in<br>
accordance with DIN 5033<br>
Application<br>
Using  the  Datacolor	38 90  spectrophotometer,   the<br>
tristimulus  value  Ry	is  determined  for  silicas,<br>
silicates, and zeolites	(powder suspensions).<br>
Analytical procedure:<br>
The silica to be analyzed is first ground to an average particle diameter of about 8 to 15 Âµm and then pressed to a tablet using a powder press. The amount required depends on the fineness of the powder. The amount of<br><br>
powder introduced is such that the thread of the press closure reaches its last turn.<br>
The samples are placed under the meter, and whiteness measurement Ry and R460 are selected from the menu of the control computer. After the sample designation has been entered/ the space key is operated in order to start the measurement.<br>
Following entry of the memory code, the measurements are printed out.<br>
The values are calculated automatically in accordance with the following formula:<br>
700 400<br>
where<br>
Y(X)    is the standard distribution coefficient,<br>
S(X)   is the relative spectral radiation distribution of<br>
the illumination source, and R(X}   is the spectral reflectance of the sample.<br>

1-7 Determination of CTAB surface area<br><br>
1. Application<br>
The method is based on the adsorption of CTAB (N-cetyl-N, N, N-triiuethylammonium bromide) on the " external" surface, which is also referred to as the " rubber-active surface".<br>
The adsorption of CTAB takes place in aqueous solution at pH = 9 with stirring and ultrasound treatment. Excess, unadsorbed CTAB is determined by back-titration with SDSS (dioctylsodium sulfosuccinate solution) using a titroprocessor, the endpoint being given by the maximum clouding of the solution and determined using a phototrode.<br>
For the calculation, an occupancy of 0.35 nm^ per CTAB molecule is assumed.<br>
The determination is made in accordance with ASTM 3765.<br>
With each measurement series, a standard sample of type VN 3 silica should be tested as well..<br>

4.1	Potassium hydroxide solution, 0.1 N<br>
4.2	CTAB solution, 0.0151 mol/1<br>
5.50 g of CTAB are dissolved with stirring (magnetic stirrer) in about 800 ml of warm (about 30-40Â°C) demineralized water in a glass beaker, transferred to a 1 1 graduated flask, made up to the mark with demineralized water after cooling to 23-25Â°C, and transferred to a stock bottle.<br>
Note:<br>
The solution must be stored and the measurement conducted at &gt;23Â°C, since CTAB crystallizes out below this temperature. The solution should be prepared 10-14 days prior to use.<br>
4.3  SDSS solution 0.00426 mol/1<br>
1,895 g of SDSS (dioctylsodium sulfo-succinate) in a glass beaker are admixed with about 800 ml of demineralized water and the mixture is stirred with a magnetic stirrer<br><br>
until all of the material has dissolved. The solution is then transferred to a 11 graduated flask, made up to the mark with demineralized water, and transferred to a stock bottle.<br>
SDSS solution readily undergoes bio-degradation. The solution prepared should therefore be sealed well and should not be stored for more than 3 months.<br>
The concentration of the CTAB solution is assumed to be exact: 0.0151 mol/1.<br>
The concentration of the SDSS solution should be determined daily by means of a ""blank" titration.<br>

5.1	Blank titration (to determine the<br>

5.1.4	Titrate with the titroprocessor until<br>
the end of titration<br>

5.3.3	Carry out titration with SDSS solution<br>
in accordance with the defined measurement method, until clouding reaches a maximum.<br>

The measurement is normally to be given corrected to the anhydrous substance:<br><br>
Where the measured value for the standard sample differs by more than Â± 3 m2/g from the theoretical value, the entire measurement series must be repeated.<br>
7. Notes<br>
re 1.   In   the   literature,   SDSS   (dioctylsodium sulfosuccinate) is also called Aerosol OT.<br>
On samples with a pH &gt; 9, such as Extrusil, the pH is measured but not corrected, since the acid may alter the surface.<br><br>
Prior to beginning the titration, the photetrode is set to 1000 mV, corresponding to a transparency of 100%.<br>
re 3. For measuring the different prescribed volumes of the CTAB solution, it is also possible to use dispensers or piston-stroke pipettes, provided they are regularly calibrated,<br>

1.8  Determination  of water vapor absorption  (water vapor isotherms)<br><br>
To determine the water vapor absorption, the sample is exposed to different relative humidities at constant temperature (30Â°C). The establishment of a constant weight is awaited.<br>
To start with, completely dry air (i.e., air humidity approximately zero) is used. After the equilibrium weight has been reached, this weight is chosen as the reference point; in other words, the water vapor absorption at a higher air humidity is expressed as the difference between the sample weight in completely dry air (following establishment of equilibrium) and the sample weight in humid air (following establishment of equilibrium) . The air humidity is varied in steps of 10%.<br>
In order to rule out hysteresis effects, both the water adsorption and the water vapor desorption are measured.<br>
Example 1<br>
The hydrophobic base silica was coated dry with silicone oil (methyl-terminated polydimethylsiloxane, viscosity 50 mPas, e.g., DOW CORNING (R) 200 FLUID 50 CS, carbon content about 33%) and conditioned by aging at room temperature for more than 48 hours (3 days) until it had obtained a methanol wettability of at least 20%. The material is heat-treated under oxidizing conditions in a muffle furnace with a bed height of not more than 2 cm at a temperature above 330-360'*C for 1 h. The analytical data of the resulting material are given in table 1.1.<br><br><br><br>
Example 2<br>
The base silica is coated with silicone oil (methyl-terminated  dimethylpolysiloxane,  50 mPas,  e.g.  DOW CORNING   (R)   200  FLUID  50  CS,   carbon  content approximately 33%) in a Gericke mixer in a mass ratio of 1:1. The resulting powder is conditioned for an hour at a temperature of 105Â°C. This produces a material in which, although it is wettable by water, the silica and silicone oil can no  longer be  separated from one another  in water.  Mixing of  this masterbatch with filtercakes  of  the  base  silica  produces  stable formulations  in which  the  silicone  oil  no  longer separates   from   the   hydrophilic   filtercake.   A hydrophobic masterbatch and a hydrophilic filtercake thus prepared (solids content about 20%) are conveyed together into the spin-flash drier, in which they are mixed (in a mass ratio of about 1:12) and dried. The dimethylsiloxane-treated silica is conditioned by aging at room temperature for at least 48 hours  (about 3 days) until it has attained a methanol wettability of at least 20%. The analytical data of the conditioned silica are given in table 2.1,<br><br><br><br>
The conditioned precipitated silica is heat-treated under oxidizing conditions in a muffle furnace with a bed height of not more than 2 cm at a temperature above 330-360Â°C for 1 h. The analytical data of the oxidatively heat-treated precipitated silica are given in table 2.3.<br><br>
Example 3<br>
The initial distribution of silicone oil (viscosity of 50 mPas, methyl-terminated, e.g., DOW CORNING (R) 200 FLUID 50 CS, carbon content approximately 33%) on the silica (in the form of filtercakes) takes place in a spin-flash drier, with simultaneous drying. The dimethylsiloxane-treated silica is conditioned by aging at room temperature for at least 48 hours (about 3 days) until it has attained a methanol wettability of at least 20%. The analytical data of the conditioned silica are given in table 3.1.<br>
  4<br><br><br>
The material is heat-treated under oxidizing conditions in a muffle furnace with a bed height of not more than 2 cm at a temperature above 330-360Â°C for 1 h. The analytical data of the oxidatively heat-treated precipitated silica are given in table 3.2.<br><br>
Example 4<br>
The base silica is coated in a mass ratio of 1:1 with<br>
silicone  oil  DOW  CORNING  (R)  200  FLUID  50  CS<br>
(dimethylpolysiloxane,    50 mPas,    terminated   with<br>
trimethylsilyl  groups,  carbon  content  approximately<br>
33%) . The resulting powder is conditioned for an hour<br>
at a temperature of more than lOOC. This produces a<br>
material in which, although it is wettable by water,<br>
the silica and silicone oil can no longer be separated<br>
from one another with water. Mixing of this masterbatch<br>
(i.e., 50% silica and 50% silicone oil) with aqueous<br>
silica dispersions produces stable suspensions in which<br>
the silicone oil can no longer be separated from the<br>
silica. The overall mixture typically contains 1 part<br>
by weight of silicone oil, about 4-8 parts by weight of<br>
silica, and 20-60 parts by weight of water. To prepare<br>
such a suspension, the masterbatch (i.e., 50% silica<br>
and 50% silicone oil) is mixed thoroughly with about	<br><br>
14-16 times the amount of filtercake (solids content approximately 20%) and about 11-13 times the amount of additional water. The analytical data of the dispersion are given in table 4.1, those of the correspondingly conditioned silica in table 4.2.<br><br>
The suspension is dried using a spray drier. The dimethylsiloxane-treated silica is conditioned by aging at room temperature for at least 4 8 hours (about 3 days) until it has attained a methanol wettability of at least 20%. The analytical data of the conditioned silica are given in table 4.2.<br><br><br>
The conditioned precipitated silica is heat-treated under oxidizing conditions in a muffle furnace with a bed height of not more than 2 cm at a temperature above 330-360Â°C for 1 h. The analytical data of the oxidatively heat-treated precipitated silica are given in table 4.3.<br><br>
Example 5<br>
Silicone oil, (polydimethylsiloxane, 50 mPas, e.g., DOW CORNING (R) 200 FLUID 50 CS, carbon content approximately 33%) is suspended in a suspension of the base silica (solids content 12.8%) using a high-shear mixer. The distribution of the silicone oil in the silica suspension is conserved by immediate spray drying. The dimethylsiloxane-treated silica is conditioned by aging at room temperature for at least 48 hours (about 3 days) until it has attained a methanol wettability of at least 20%. The analytical data of the conditioned silica are given in table 5.1.<br><br><br><br>
The material is heat-treated under oxidizing conditions in a muffle furnace with a bed height of not more than 2 cm at a temperature above 330-360*^C for 1 h. The analytical data of the oxidatively heat-treated precipitated silica are given in table 5.2.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
