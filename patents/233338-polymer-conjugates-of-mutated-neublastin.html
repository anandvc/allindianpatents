FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to protein chemistry, molecular biology, neurobiology,<br>
neurology, and pain management.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Neurotrophic factors are naturally-occurring proteins that regulate neuronal survival<br>
during development and regulate plasticity and structural integrity of the adult nervous<br>
system. Neurotrophic factors can be isolated from neural tissue and from non-neural tissue.<br>
During the last twenty years, many neurotrophic factors have been discovered. These<br>
neurotrophic factors can be classified into superfamilies, families, subfamilies and individual<br>
species based on their structure and function.<br>
Neurotrophic factor superfamilies include the fibroblast-growth factor {FGF)<br>
superfamily, the neurotrophin superfamily, and the transforming growth factor-J5 (TGF-P)<br>
superfamily. The glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor'(GDKF)-related ligands are a<br>
family of proteins within the TGF-p superfamily. GDNF-related ligands include GDNF,<br>
persephin (PSP), neurturin (NTN) and neublastin (NBN; known as artemin orenovin).<br>
Members of the GDNF-related ligand family are distinguished by, among other things, their<br>
seven conserved cysteine residues. These residues form intramolecular and intermolecular<br>
disulfide bridges and give rise to the tertiary and quaternary structure of the dimerized<br>
polypeptide ligand. Members of the family also share the ability to induce signaling through<br>
a multicomponent receptor complex consisting of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol <br>
anchored co-receptor of the GFRa family, a member of the GDNF-related ligand subfamily,<br>
and the RET tyrosine kinase receptor.<br>
Activated RET initiates a signal transduction cascade that is responsible, at least in<br>
part, for the downstream effects of GDNF-related ligands. Accordingly, activation of RET<br>
may represent one desirable aspect of a therapy which acts through a GFRa receptor pathway<br>
to affect downstream cellular processes.<br>
Neublastin is classified within the GDNF family because it shares regions of<br>
homology with other GDNF ligands including the seven cysteine motif (eg., as described in<br>
EP02/02691, PCT publications US02/02319 and US02/06388), and because of its ability Jo<br>
bind to, and activate, the RET receptor as part of a GFRa complex. Specifically, neublastin<br>
is highly selective for binding to the GFRa3-RET receptor complex. In that respect,<br>
neublastin contains unique sub regions in its amino acid sequence as compared with other<br>
members of the GDNF-related ligand family.<br>
Current data suggest that neublastin may have a protective and regenerative role in the<br>
peripheral and central nervous systems and, as a result, may be useful as a therapeutic agent<br>
for neurodegenerative disorders. For example, data suggest that neublastin may have survival<br>
promoting effects on cultured sensory neurons from dorsal root ganglia and from trigeminal<br>
ganglia, and on cultured substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons (Baloh et al., Neuron 21:<br>
1291-1302 (1998)). It therefore appears that neublastin may promote survival of neuronal<br>
populations including sensory and dopaminergic neurons. This is important because the<br>
degeneration and dysfunction of neurons has been associated with disease states. For<br>
example, sensory and dopaminergic neuron pathologies underlie peripheral neuropathy and<br>
Parkinson's disease, respectively..<br>
Therefore, administration of neublastin may be useful, for example, in the treatment<br>
of diseases associated with neuronal degeneration and dysfunction. However, neublastin is<br>
rapidly cleared by the body, which may affect the neublastin dosing paradigm required in<br>
therapeutic applications. Thus, a need exists for modified neublastin polypeptides with<br>
enhanced bioavailability. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to identify<br>
modified forms of neublastin which exhibit enhanced bioavailability.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention provides polymer-conjugated, mutated neublastin dimers. Each dimer<br>
contains a first polypeptide comprising a first amino-terminal amino acid and a second<br>
polypeptide comprising a second amino-terminal amino acid. Each polypeptide individually<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Unless otherwise stated, any reference to a neublastin amino acid position number will refer to the numbering illustrated in SEQ ID NO: 1.<br>
Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. Although methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the invention, suitable methods and materials are described below. All publications, patent applications, patents, and other references mentioned herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety. In the case of conflict, the present specification, including definitions, will -control. In addition, the materials, methods, and examples are illustrative only and not intended to be limiting.<br>
As used herein, "wild-type neublastin polypeptide" means a naturally-occurring neublastin polypeptide sequence. A wild-type neublastin polypeptide may be further defined by the source of the neublastin, for example, human, mouse, or rat neublastin (see, e.g., SEQ ID NO: 2, 3, or 4). A consensus neublastin polypeptide sequence is provided as SEQ ID NO:l.<br>
As used herein, "mutated neublastin polypeptide," means a polypeptide that-contains at least a specified minimum level of sequence identity with respect to a wild-type neublastin polypeptide, contains at least one amino acid substitution, insertion or fusion, with respect to the<br><br>
wild-type neublastin polypeptide, and displays neublastin activity fag., as described in<br>
International application No. PCT/US02/02319 (WO 02/060929).)<br>
As used herein, "internal polymer conjugation site" means a non-terminal amino acid<br>
residue in a mutated neublastin polypeptide, which residue provides a side chain suitable for<br>
conjugation of a polymer.<br>
As used herein, "modified neublastin polypeptide," means a polypeptide that contains at<br>
least one attached polymer.<br>
As used herein, "fusion" means a co-linear, covalent linkage of two or more<br>
polypeptides through their respective peptide backbones through-genetic expression of a<br>
polynucleotide molecule encoding those proteins in the same reading frame.<br>
As used herein, "identity" refers to the sequence similarity between two polypeptides,<br>
molecules or between two nucleic acids. When a position in both of the two compared<br>
sequences is occupied by the same base or amino acid monomer subunit (for instance, if a<br>
position in each of the two DNA molecules is occupied by adenine, or a position in each t&gt;f<br>
two polypeptides is occupied by a lysine), then the respective molecules are homologous at<br>
that position. The "percentage identity" between two sequences is a function of the number<br>
of matching positions shared by the two sequences divided by the number of positions<br>
compared x 100. For instance, if 6 of 10 positions in two sequences are matched, then the two<br>
sequences have 60% identity. By way of example, the DNA sequences CTGACT and<br>
CAGGTT share 50% homology (3 of the 6 total positions are matched). Generally, a<br>
comparison is made when two sequences are aligned to give maximum homology. Such<br>
alignment can be provided using, for instance, the method of Needleman et al., J. Mol Biol.<br>
48: 443-453 (1970), implemented conveniently by computer programs such as the Align<br>
program (DNAstar, Inc.). "Similar" sequences are those which, when aligned, share identical<br>
and similar amino acid residues, where similar residues are conservative substitutions for, or<br>
"allowed point mutations" of, corresponding amino acid residues in an aligned reference<br>
sequence. In this regard, a "conservative substitution" of a residue in a reference sequence is a<br>
substitution by a residue that is physically or functionally similar to the corresponding<br>
reference residue, e.g., that has a similar size, shape, -electric charge, chemical properties,<br>
including the ability to form covalent or hydrogen bonds, or the like. Thus, a conservative<br>
substitution mutated" sequence is one that differs from areference sequence or a wild-type<br>
sequence in that one or more conservative substitutions or allowed point mutations are<br>
present. The "percentage positive" between two sequences is a function of the number of<br>
positions that contain matching residues or conservative substitutions shared by the two<br>
sequences divided by the number of positions compared x 100. For instance, if 6 of 10<br>
positions in two sequences are matched and 2 of 10 positions contain conservative<br>
substitutions, then the two sequences have 80% positive homology.<br>
Mutated Neublastin Polypeptides<br>
The mutated neublastin polypeptides of the invention retain neurotrophic activity and<br>
have enhanced bioavailability as compared to the wild-type neublastin polypeptide. For<br>
example, the mutated neublastins of this invention activate the RET gene product hi assays in<br>
which the wild-type neublastin activates RET. hi general, the mutated neublastin polypeptide<br>
will retain at least one of the following features but will additionally comprise at least one<br>
modification, such that an internal polymer conjugation site is created:<br>
(i) seven conserved cysteine residues at positions 16,43,47, SO, 81,109, and 111<br>
when numbered in accordance with SEQ ID NO: 1-4;<br>
(ii) amino acid residues as follows:<br>
C at position 16, L at position 18, V at position 25, L at position 28,<br>
G at position 29, L at position 30, G at position 31, E at position 36, F at<br>
position 40, R at position 41, F at position 42, C at position 43, G at position<br>
45, C at position 47, C at position 80, C at position 81, R at position 82, P at<br>
position 83, F at position 91, D at position 93, S at position 105, A at position<br>
106, C at position 109 and C at position 111, each when numbered in<br>
accordance with SEQ ID NO: 1-4;<br>
(iii) an LGLG repeat, an FRFC motif, a QPCCRP motif, and a SATACGC motif.<br>
In some embodiments, the invention provides a truncated mutated neublastin<br>
polypeptide, wherein the amino terminus of the truncated neublastin polypeptide lacks one or<br>
more amino-terminal amino acids of a mature neublastin polypeptide but is mutated to<br>
possess an internal polymer attachment. Preferably, the truncated mutated neublastin<br>
polypeptide, when dimeriaed, activates a RET polypeptide. In some embodiments the<br>
mutated neublastin polypeptide induces dimenzation of the RET polypeptide. "Such induction<br>
may require additional polypeptides or co-factors, as would be apparent to one of skill in the<br>
art.<br>
Amino acid sequences of human and mouse neublastin polypeptides are disclosed in<br>
PCTpublicationWOOO/01815. Examples of wild-type neublastin polypeptides according to<br>
the invention are presented in Table 1A. A neublastin consensus sequence (•consensus with<br>
respect to human, mouse and rat) is set forth in Table IB.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
In some embodiments, at least one of the arginuie (Arg or R) or asparagine (Asn orN)<br>
residues shown in bold in Table 1A is substituted with a diiferent amino acid residue. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the mutated neublastin polypeptide has a lysine (Lys or K) residue<br>
substituted for the asparagine at amino acid position 95, indicated by an asterisk in Table 1 A,<br>
and is referred to as NBN-N95K. In general, the N95K substitution results in improved<br>
solubility. This facilitates formulation at high concentrations.<br>
Table IE. I^NllS Consensus Sequence<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The invention includes a polymer-conjugated mutated neublastin polypeptide<br>
comprising an amino acid sequence that is, for example, at least 70% identical to amino acids<br>
8-113 of SEQ ID NO:1 (also shown in Table 1). In one embodiment, one or more of the<br>
arginines at position 14, position 39, position 68, or the asparagine at position 95 is replaced<br>
by an amino acid other than arginine or asparagine. In one embodiment, the wild-type amino<br>
acid is substituted with lysine or cysteine.<br>
The substituted residues in the mutated neublastin polypeptide can be chosen to<br>
facilitate coupling of a polymer, e.g., a polyalkylene glycol polymer, at the substituted amino<br>
acid. Advantageous sites of modification are those at solvent accessible regions in the<br>
neublastin polypeptide. Such sites can be chosen based on inspection of the crystal structure<br>
of the related neurotrophic factor, such as GDNF, whose crystal structure is described in<br>
Eigenbrot et al., Nat. Struct. Biol. 4:435-38,1997. Sites also can be chosen basedtm the<br>
crystal structure of neublastin, whose crystallization and structure determination is described<br>
below. Also, sites can be chosen based on structural-functional information provided for<br>
persephin/neublastin chimeric proteins. These chimeras are described in Baloh et al., J. Biol.<br>
Chem. 275:3412-20,2000. An exemplary listing of solvent accessible or surface exposed<br>
neublastin amino acids identified through this methodology is set forth in Table 2.<br>
Table 2 provides a list of residues and numbers in human neublastin that are expected,<br>
to be surface exposed. The first column refers to surface exposed residues determined by<br>
examining the structure of the rat GDNF dimer formed by chains A and B (PDB code 1AGQ)<br>
and determining whether a residue was on the surface of the structure. This -structure was<br>
then compared to a sequence alignment of GDNF and neublastin in Baloh et al, Neuron<br>
21:1291-1302,1998 to determine the proper residues in neublastin. The second and third<br>
columns, respectively, refer to the surface exposed residues determined by examining the<br>
structure of the human neublastin dimer formed by chains'A and B. The numbering-scheme<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
indicates that the residues are not present in the structures of GDNF or neublastin. This is<br>
either because of construct design, flexible regions, or inserts in neublastin relative to<br>
GDNF (residues 68-71).<br>
indicates the residues are buried and not on the surface or are cysteine residues involved<br>
in disulfide bonds. As this protein is a cysteine knot, a great majority of the residues ate<br>
on the surface.<br>
indicates that this residue is surface exposed in the GDNF structure or in the neublastin<br>
structure, although the loop containing residues 66-75 is visible in only one of the GDNF<br>
monomers (presumably flexible). This loop also contains a 4 residue insert in neublastin<br>
relative to GDNF.<br>
Insome embodiments, the neublastin poly'peptide retains the seven conserved Cys<br>
residues that are characteristic of the GDNF subfamily and of the TGF-beta super family.<br>
The sequence of the human full-length prepro NBN polypeptkle (SEQ ID NO:5) is<br>
shown in Table 3. Three mature forms of neublastin polypeptides were identified. These<br>
forms include:<br>
 (i) the 140 AA polypeptide designated herein as NBN140, which possesses the amino<br>
acid sequence designated as SEQ ID N0:6;<br>
(ii) the 116 AA polypeptide designated herein as NBN116, which possesses the amino<br>
acid sequence designated as SEQ ID N0:7; and<br>
(Hi) the 113 AA polypeptide designated herein as NBN113, which possesses the<br>
amino acid sequence designated as SEQ ID NO:2.<br>
Table 3 illustrates the relationship between the disclosed prepro neublastin<br>
polypeptide sequences of the invention. Line 1 provides the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:5,<br>

The polypeptide sequences of these truncated neublastin polypeptides are shown in<br>
Table 4 for NBN113 through NBN99. Disulfide bridge formation is as described for (Table Removed)<br><br>
A mutated neublastin polypeptide according to the invention can be, e.g., at least<br>
80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 98% or 99% identical to amino acids 8-113 of SEQ ID NO:1. In<br>
some embodiments, the amino acid sequence of the mutated neublastin polypeptide includes<br>
the amino acid sequence of a naturally occurring rat, human or mouse neublastin polypeptide<br>
at amino acids 1-94 and 96-113 of the mutated neublastin polypeptide, e.g., the polypeptide<br>
has the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NOs: 2, 3, or 4 at these positions.<br>
A mutated neublastin polypeptide differing in sequence from those disclosed in SEQ<br>
ID NOs:l-4 may include one or more conservative amino acid substitutions. Alternatively,<br>
or in addition, the mutated neublastin polypeptide may differ by one or more non<br>
conservative amino acid substitutions, or by deletions or insertions. Preferably, the<br>
substitutions, insertions or deletions do not abolish the isolated protein's biological activity.<br>
A conservative substitution is the substitution of one amino acid for another with<br>
similar characteristics. Conservative substitutions include substitutions within the following<br>
groups: valine, alanine and glycine; leucine, valine, and isoleucine; aspartic acid and glutamic<br>
acid; asparagine and glutamine; serine, cysteine, and threonine; lysine and arginine; and<br>
phenylalanine and tyrosine. The non-polar hydrophobic amino acids include alanine, leucine,<br>
isoleucine, valine, proline, phenylalanine, tryptophan and methionine. The polar neutral<br>
amino acids include glycine, serine, threonine, cysteine, tyrosine, asparagine and glutamine.<br>
The positively charged (basic) amino acids include arginine, lysine and histidine. The<br>
negatively charged (acidic) amino acids include aspartic acid and glutamic acid. Any<br>
substitution of one member of the above-mentioned polar, basic or acidic groups by another<br>
member of the same group can be deemed a conservative substitution.<br>
Other substitutions can be readily identified by those of ordinary skill in the art. For<br>
example, for the amino acid alanine, a substitution can be taken from any onet&gt;f D-alanine,<br>
glycine, beta-alanine, cysteine and D-cysteine. For lysine, a replacement can be any one of<br>
D-lysine, arginine, D-arginine, homo-arginine, methionine, D-methionine, omithine, or<br>
D-ornithine. Generally, substitutions in functionally important regions .mat may be expected<br>
to induce changes in the properties of isolated polypeptides are those in which: (i) a polar<br>
residue, e.g., serine or threonine, is substituted for (or b}') a hydrophobic residue, e.g.,<br>
leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, or alanine; (ii) a cysteine residue is substituted for (or by)<br>
any other residue; (iii) a residue having an electropositive side chain, e.g., lysine, arginine or<br>
histidine, is substituted for (or by) a residue having an electronegative-side chain, e.g.,<br>
glutamic acid or aspartic acid; or (iv) a residue having a bulky side chain, e.g., phenylalanine,<br>
is substituted for (or by) one not having such a side chain, e.g., glycine. The likelihood that<br>
one of the foregoing non-conservative substitutions may alter functional properties of the<br>
protein is also correlated to the position of the substitution with respect to functionally<br>
important regions of the protein. Some non-conservative substitutions may accordingly have<br>
little or no effect on biological properties.<br>
In many cases, a polymer-conjugated mutated neublastin polypeptide has a longer<br>
serum half-life relative to the half-life of the wild-type polypeptide or mutated polypeptide in<br>
the absence of the polymer. In some embodiments, the polymer conjugated mutated<br>
neublastin polypeptide has significantly increased potency in vivo relative to the potency of<br>
the polypeptide or glycosylated-polypeptide in the absence of the polymer.<br>

Synthesis and Isolation of Wild-Type and Mutated Neublastin Polypeptides<br>
Neublastin polypeptides can be isolated using methods known in the art. Naturally<br>
occurring neublastin polypeptides can be isolated from cells or tissue sources by an<br>
appropriate purification scheme using standard protein purification techniques. Alternatively,<br>
mutated neublastin polypeptides can be synthesized chemically using standard peptide<br>
synthesis techniques. The synthesis of short amino acid sequences is well established in the<br>
peptide art. See, e.g., Stewart, et al., Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis (2d ed., 1984).<br>
In some embodiments, mutated neublastin polypeptides are produced by recombinant<br>
DNA techniques. For example, a nucleic acid molecule encoding a mutated neublastin<br>
polypeptide can be inserted into a vector, e.g., an expression vector, and the nucleic acid can<br>
be introduced into a cell. Suitable cells include, e.g., mammalian cells (such as human cells<br>
or CHO cells), fungal cells, yeast cells, insect cells, and bacterial cells. When expressed in a<br>
recombinant cell, the cell is preferably cultured under conditions allowing for expression of a<br>
mutated neublastin polypeptide. The mutated neublastin polypeptide can be recovered from a<br>
cell suspension if desired. As used herein, "recovered" means that the mutated polypeptide is<br>
removed from those components of a cell or culture medium in which it is present prior to the<br>
recovery process. The recovery process may include one or more refolding or purification<br>
steps.<br>
Mutated neublastin polypeptides can be constructed using any of several methods<br>
known in the art. One such method is site-directed mutagenesis, in which a specific<br>
nucleotide (or, if desired a small number of specific nucleotides) is changed in order to<br>
change a single amino acid (or, if desired, a small number of predetermined amino acid<br>
residues) in the encoded neublastin polypeptide. Those skilled in the art recognize that sitedirected<br>
mutagenesis is a routine and widely used technique. In fact, many site-directed<br>
mutagenesis kits are commercially available. One such kit is the "Transformer Site Directed<br>
Mutagenesis Kit" sold by Clontech Laboratories (Palo Alto, Calif.).<br>
Practice of the present invention will employ, unless indicated otherwise,<br>
conventional techniques of cell biology, cell culture, molecular biology, microbiology,<br>
recombinant DNA, protein chemistry, and immunology, which are within the skill of the art.<br>
Such techniques are described in the literature. See, for example, Molecular Cloning: A<br>

Polymer Conjugation of Neublastin Polypep tides<br>
Chemically modified neublastin polypeptides may be prepared by one of-skill in the<br>
art based upon the present disclosure. The chemical moieties preferred for conjugation to a<br>
neublastin polypeptide are water-soluble polymers. A water-soluble polymer is advantageous<br>
because the protein to which it is attached does not precipitate in an aqueous environment,<br>
such as a physiological environment. Preferably, the polymer will be pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable for the preparation of a therapeutic product or composition.<br>
If desired, a single polymer molecule may be employed for conjugation with a<br>
neublastin polypeptide, although more than one polymer molecule can be attached as well.<br>
Conjugated neublastin compositions of the invention may find utility in both hi vivo as well<br>
as non-in vivo applications. Additionally, it will be recognized that the conjugating polymer<br>
may utilize any other groups, moieties, or other conjugated species, as appropriate to the end<br>
use application. By way of example, it may be useful in some applications to covalently<br>
bond to the polymer a functional moiety imparting UV-degradation resistance, or<br>
antioxidation, or other properties or characteristics to the polymer. As a further example, it<br>
may be advantageous in some applications to functionalize the polymer to render it reactive<br>
or cross-linkable in character, to enhance various properties or characteristics of the overall<br>
conjugated material. Accordingly, the polymer may contain any functionality, repeating<br>
groups, linkages, or other constituent structures that do not preclude the efficacy of the<br>
conjugated neublastin composition for its intended purpose.<br>
One skilled in the art will be able to select the desired polymer based on such<br>
considerations as whether the polymer/protein conjugate will be used therapeutically, and if<br>
so, the desired dosage, circulation time, resistance to proteolysis, and other considerations.<br>
The effectiveness of the derivatization may be ascertained by administering the derivative, in<br>
the desired form {e.g., by osmotic pump, or, more preferably, by injection or infusion, or,<br>
further formulated for oral, pulmonary or other delivery routes), and determining its<br>
effectiveness.<br>
Suitable water-soluble polymers include, but are not limited to, PEG, copolymers of<br>
ethylene glycol/propylene glycol, carboxymethylcellulose, dextran, polyvinyl alcohol,<br>
polyvinyl pyrrolidone, poly-1,3-dioxolane, poly-1, 3,6-trioxane, ethylene/maleic anhydride<br>
copolymer, polyaminoacids (either homopolymers or random copolymers), and dextran or<br>
poly(n-vinyl pyrrolidone) PEG, propropylene glycol homopolymers, polypropylene<br>
oxide/ethylene oxide co-polymers, polyoxyethylated polyols (e.g., glycerol), polyvinyl<br>
alcohol, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The polymer may be of any suitable molecular weight, and may be branched or<br>
unbranched.<br>
For PEG, suitable average molecular weight is between about 2 kDa and about 100<br>
kDa. This provides for ease hi handling and manufacturing. Those of skill in the art will<br>
appreciate that in preparations of PEG, some molecules will weigh more, some less, than the<br>
stated molecular weight. Thus, molecular weight is typically specified as "average molecular<br>
weight." Other molecular weights (sizes) may be used, depending on the desired therapeutic<br>
profile (e.g., the duration of sustained release desired; the effects, if any, on biological<br>
activity; the ease in handling; the degree or lack of antigenicity and other known effects of<br>
PEG on a therapeutic protein). In various embodiments, the molecular weight is about 2 kDa,<br>
about 5 kDa, about 10 kDa, about 15 kDa, about 20 kDa, about 25 kDa, about 30 kDa, about<br>
40 kDa or about 100 kDa. In certain preferred embodiments, the average molecular weight of<br>
each PEG chain is about 20 kDa. In certain preferred embodiments, the average molecular<br>
weight is about 10 kDa.<br>
The number of polymer molecules so attached may vary, and one skilled in the art<br>
v/ill be able to ascertain the effect on function. One may mono-derivatize, or may provide for<br>
a di-, tri-, tetra- or some combination of derivatization, with the same or different chemical<br>
moieties (e.g., polymers, such as different weights of PEGs). The proportion of polymer<br>
molecules to protein (or polypeptide) molecules will vary, as will their concentrations in the<br>
reaction mixture. In general, the optimum ratio (in terms of efficiency of reaction in that<br>
there is no excess unreacted protein or polymer) will be determined by factors-such as the<br>
desired degree of derivatization (e.g., mono, di-, tri-, etc.), the molecular weight of the<br>
polymer selected, whether the polymer is branched or unbranched, and the reaction<br>
conditions.<br>
The PEG molecules {or other chemical moieties) should be attached to the protein<br>
with consideration of effects on functional or antigenic domains of the protein. There are a<br>
number of attachment methods available to those skilled in the art. See, e.g., EP 0 4013S4<br>
(coupling PEG to G-CSF); Malik et al., Exp. Hematol. 20:1028-1035,1992 (reporting<br>
PEGylation of GM-CSF using tresyl chloride).<br>
For example, PEG may be covalently bound (PEGylation) through amino acid<br>
residues via a reactive group, such as, a free amino or carboxyl group. The amino acid<br>
residues having a free amino group include lysine residues and the ammo-terminal amino<br>
acid residue. Those having a free carboxyl group include aspartic acid residues, glutamic<br>
acid residues, and the C-terminal amino acid residue. Sulfhydryl groups may also be used as<br>
a reactive group for attaching the PEG molecule(s). For therapeutic purposes, attachment can<br>
be at an amino group, e.g. at the N- terminus or lysine group. One may specifically desire an<br>
amino-terminal chemically modified protein.<br>
Using PEG as an illustration of the present compositions, one may select from a<br>
variety of PEG molecules (by molecular weight, branching, etc.), the proportion of PEG<br>
molecules to protein (or peptide) molecules in the reaction mix, the type of PEGylation<br>
reaction to be performed, and the method of obtaining the selected amino-terminally<br>
PEGylated protein. The method of obtaining the amino-terminal PEGylated preparation (i.e.,<br>
separating this moiety from other monoPEGylated moieties if necessary) may be by<br>
purification of the amino-terminal PEGylated material from a population of PEGylated<br>
protein molecules. Selective amino-terminal chemical modification may be accomplished by<br>
reductive alkylation that exploits differential reactivity of different types of primary amino<br>
groups (lysine versus the amino-terminal) available for derivatization in a particularprotein.<br>
Under the appropriate reaction conditions, substantially selective derivatization .of the protein<br>
at the ammo-terminus with a carbonyl group containing polymer is achieved. For example,<br>
one may selectively PEGylate the ammo-terminus of the protein by performing the reaction<br>
at a pH which allows one to take advantage of the pKa differences between the epsilon<br>
(8)-amino group of the lysine residues and that of the alpha (a)-amino group of the aminoterminal<br>
residue of the protein. By such selective derivatization, attachment of a water<br>
soluble polymer to a protein is controlled: the conjugation with the polymer takes place<br>
predominantly at the amino-terminus of the protein and no significant modification of other<br>
reactive groups, such as the lysine side -chain amino groups, occurs.<br>
Using reductive alkylation, the water-soluble polymer may be of the type described<br>
above, and should have a single reactive aldehyde for coupling to the protein. PEG<br>
propionaldehyde, containing a single reactive aldehyde, may be used.<br>
The present invention includes mutated neublastin polypeptides that are expressed in<br>
prokaryotes or eukaryotes or made synthetically. In some embodiments, the neublastin is<br>
glycosylated. In some specific embodiments, the neublastin dimer is polymer-conjugated at<br>
each amino-terminus and glycosylated at each internal Asn95 residue. Li other embodiments,<br>
the mutated neublastin dimer is polymer-conjugated at each amino-terminus and polymerconjugated<br>
at one or both internal Lys95 residues.<br>
PEGylation maybe carried out by any suitable PEGylation reaction. Various<br>
PEGylation chemistries are known in the art. See, e.g., Focus on Growth Factors, 3 (2): 4-10,<br>
1992; EP 0 154 316; EP 0 401 384; and the other publications cited herein that relate to<br>
PEGylation. The PEGylation may be carried out via an acylation reaction or an alkylation<br>
reaction with a reactive PEG molecule (or an analogous reactive water-soluble polymer).<br>
PEGylation by acylation generally involves reacting an active ester derivative of PEG.<br>
Any known or subsequently discovered reactive PEG molecule may be used to carry out the<br>
PEGylation. A preferred activated PEG ester is PEG esterified to N-hydroxysuccinimide<br>
(NHS). As used herein, "acylation" includes without limitation the following types of<br>
linkages between the therapeutic protein and a water soluble polymer such as PEG: amide,<br>
carbamate, urethane, and the like. See, Bioconjugate Chem. 5: 133-140,1994. Reaction<br>
conditions may be selected from any of those known in the PEGylation art or those<br>
subsequently developed, but should avoid conditions such as temperature, solvent, and pH<br>
that would inactivate the neublastin protein or polypeptide to be modified.<br>
PEGylation by acylation will generally result in a poly-PEGylated neublastin protein<br>
product. Preferably, the connecting linkage will be an amide. Also preferably, the resulting<br>
product will be substantially only (e.g., &gt; 95%) mono, di- or tri-PEGylated. However, some<br>
species with higher degrees of PBGylation may be formed in amounts depending on the<br>
specific reaction conditions used. If desired, more purified PEGylated species may be<br>
separated from the mixture, particularly unreacted species, by standard purification<br>
techniques, including, among others, dialysis, salting-out, ultrafiltration, ion- exchange<br>
chromatography, gel filtration chromatography and electrophoresis.<br>
PEGylation by alkylation generally involves reacting a terminal aldehyde derivative<br>
of PEG with neublastin in the presence of a reducing agent. PEGylation by alkylation can<br>
also result in poly-PEGylated neublastin protein products. In addition, one can manipulate<br>
the reaction conditions to favor PEGylation substantially only at the cc-amino .group of the<br>
amino-terminus of neublastin (i.e., a mono-PEGylated protein). In either ease of mono-<br>
PEGylation or poly-PEGylation, the PEG groups are preferably attached to the protein via a<br>
-CH2-NH- group. With particular reference to the -CH2- group, this type of linkage is<br>
referred to herein as an "alky!" linkage.<br>
Derivatization via reductive alkylation to produce a mono-PEGylated product exploits<br>
differential reactivity of different types of primary amino groups (lysine versus the aminoterminal)<br>
available for derivatization. The reaction is performed at a pH that allows one to<br>
take advantage of the pKa differences between the e-amino groups of the lysine residues and<br>
that of the a-amino group of the amino-terminal residue of the protein. By such selective<br>
derivatization, attachment of a water soluble polymer that contains a reactive group such as<br>
an aldehyde, to a protein is controlled: the conjugation with the polymer takes place<br>
predominantly at the amino-terminus of the protein and no significant modification of other<br>
reactive groups, such as the lysine side chain amino groups, occurs.<br>
The polymer molecules used in both the acylation and alkylation approaches may be<br>
selected from among water-soluble polymers as described above. The polymer selected<br>
should be modified to have a single reactive group, such as an active ester for acylation or an<br>
aldehyde for alkylation, preferably, so that the degree of polymerization may be controlled as<br>
provided for in the present methods. An exemplary reactive PEG aldehyde is PEG<br>
propionaldehyde, which is water stable, or mono Cl-Cl 0 alkoxy or aryloxy derivatives<br>
thereof (see, U.S. Patent 5,252,714). The polymer may be branched or unbranched. For the<br>
acylation reactions, the polymer(s^) selected should have a single reactive ester .group. For the<br>
present reductive alkylation, the polymer(s) selected should have a single reactive aldehyde<br>
group. Generally, the water-soluble polymer will not be selected from naturally-occurring<br>
glycosyl residues since these are usually made more conveniently by mammalian<br>
recombinant expression systems. The polymer may be of any molecular weight, and maybe<br>
branched or unbranched.<br>
An exemplar}' water-soluble polymer for use herein is PEG. As used herein,<br>
polyethylene glycol encompasses any of the forms of PEG that have been4ised<to derivative></to>
other proteins, including but not limited to, e.g., mono-(Cl-ClO) alkoxy- or aryloxy-PEG.<br>
In general, chemical derivatization may be performed under any suitable condition<br>
used to react a biologically active substance with an activated polymer molecule. Methods<br>
for preparing a PEGylated neublastin will generally comprise the steps of (a) reacting a<br>
neublastin protein or polypeptide with PEG (such as a reactive-ester or aldehyde derivative of<br>
PEG) under conditions whereby the molecule becomes attached to one or more PEG groups,<br>
and (b) obtaining the reaction produces). In general, the optimal reaction conditions for the<br>
acylation reactions will be determined case by case based on known parameters and the<br>
desired result. For example, the larger the ratio of PEGrprotein, the greater the percentage of<br>
poly-PEGylated product.<br>
Reductive alkylation to produce a substantially homogeneous population of monopolymer/<br>
neublastin will generally comprise the steps of: (a) reacting a neublastin protein or<br>
polypeptide with a reactive PEG molecule under reductive alkylation conditions, at a pH<br>
suitable to pen-nit selective modification of the a-amino group at the amino terminus of<br>
neublastin; and (b) obtaining the reaction product(s).<br>
For a substantially homogeneous population of mono-polymer/ neublastin, the<br>
reductive alkylation reaction conditions are those that permit the selective attachment of the<br>
water-soluble polymer moiety to the ammo-terminus of neublastin. Such reaction conditions<br>
generally provide for pKa differences between the lysine amino groups and the a-amino<br>
group at the ammo-terminus (the pKa being the pH at which 50% of the amino groups are<br>
protonated and 50% are not). The pH also affects the ratio of polymer to protein to be used.<br>
In general, if the pH is lower, a larger excess of polymer to protein will be desired {z.e., the<br>
less reactive the amino-terminal a-amino group, the more polymer needed to achieve optimal<br>
conditions). If the pH is higher, the polymenprotein ratio need not be as large (i.e., more<br>
reactive groups are available, so fewer polymer molecules are needed). For purposes of the<br>
present invention, the pH will generally fall within the range of 3-9, preferably 3-6.<br>
Another important consideration is the molecular weight of the polymer. In general,<br>
the higher the molecular weight of the polymer, the fewer polymer molecules may be<br>
attached to the protein. Similarly, branching of the polymer should be taken into account<br>
when optimizing these parameters. Generally, the higher the molecular weight (or the more<br>
branches) the higher the polymenprotein ratio, hi general, for the PEGylation reactions<br>
included herein, the preferred average molecular weight is about 2 kDa to about 1T)0 kDa.<br>
The preferred average molecular weight is about 5 kDa to about 50 kDa, particularly<br>
preferably about 10 kDa to about 20 kDa. The preferred total molecular weight is about<br>
lOkDa to about 40 kDa.<br>
In some embodiments, the neublastin polypeptide is linked to the polymer via a<br>
terminal reactive group on the polypeptide. Alternatively, or in addition, the«eublastin<br>
polypeptide may be linked via the side chain amino group of an internal lysine residue, e.g., a<br>
lysine residue introduced into the amino acid sequence of a naturally occurring neublastin<br>
polypeptide. Thus, conjugations can also be branched from the non terminal reactive groups.<br>
The polymer with the reactive group(s) is designated herein as "activated polymer". The<br>
reactive group selectively reacts with reactive groups on the protein, e.g., free amino.<br>
Attachment may occur in the activated polymer at any available neublastin amino<br>
group such as the alpha amino groups or the epsilon amino groups of a lysine residue or<br>
residues introduced into the amino acid sequence of a neublastin polypeptide. Free<br>
carboxylic groups, suitably activated carbonyl groups, hydroxyl, guanidyl, imidazole,<br>
oxidized carbohydrate moieties and mercapto groups of the neublastin (if available) can also<br>
be used as attachment sites.<br>
Generally from about 1.0 to about 10 moles of activated polymer per mole of protein,<br>
depending on protein concentration, is employed. The final amount is a balance between<br>
maximizing the extent of the reaction while minimizing non-specific modifications of the<br>
product and, at the same time, defining chemistries that will maintain optimum activity, while<br>
at the same time optimizing, if possible, the half-life of the protein. Preferably, at least about<br>
50% of the biological activity of the protein is retained, and most preferably near 100% is<br>
retained.<br>
The polymer can be coupled to the neublastin polypeptide using methods known in<br>
the art. For example, in one embodiment, the polyalkylene glycol moiety is coupled to a<br>
lysine group of the mutated neublastin polypeptide. Linkage to the lysine group can be<br>
performed with an N-hydroxylsuccinimide (NHS) active ester such as PEG succinimidyl<br>
succinate (SS-PEG) and succinimidyl propionate {SPA-PEG). Suitable polyalkylene glycol<br>
moieties include, e.g.t carboxymethyl-NHS, norteucine-NHS, SC-PEG, ttesylate, aldehyde,<br>
epoxide, carbonylimidazole, and PNP carbonate.<br>
Additional amine reactive PEG linkers can be substituted for the succmimidyl moiety.<br>
These include, e.g. isothiocyanates, nitrophenylcarbonates, epoxides, and benzotriazole<br>
carbonates. Conditions are preferably chosen to maximize the selectivity and extent or<br>
reaction.<br>
If desired, polymer-conjugated neublastin polypeptides may contain a tag, e.g., a tag<br>
that can subsequently be released by proteolysis. Thus, the lysine moiety can be selectively<br>
modified by first reacting a His-tag modified with a low molecular weight linker-such as<br>
Traut's reagent j(Pierce) which will react with both the lysine and amino-terminus, and then<br>
releasing the his tag. The polypeptide will then contain a free SH group that^an be<br>
selectively modified with a PEG containing a thiol reactive head group -such as a maleimMe<br>
group, a vinylsulfone group, a haloacetate group, or a free or protected SH.<br>
Traut's reagent can be replaced with any linker that will-set up a specific site for PEG<br>
attachment. By way of example, Traut's reagent could be replaced with SPDP, SMPT,<br>
SATA, or SATP (all available from Pierce). Similarly one + could react the protein with an<br>
amine reactive linker that inserts a maleimide (for example SMCC, AMAS, BMPS, MBS,<br>
EMCS, SMPB, SMPH, KMUS, or GMBS), a haloacetate group(SBAP, SIA, SIAB), or a<br>
vinylsulfone group and react the resulting product with a PEG that contains a free SH. The<br>
only limitation to the size of the linker that is employed is that it cannot block the subsequent<br>
removal of the amino-terminal tag.<br>
Thus, in other embodiments, the polyalkylene glycol moiety is coupled to a cysteine<br>
group of the mutated neublastin polypeptide. Coupling can be effected using, e.g., a<br>
maleimide group, a vinylsulfone group, a haloacetate group, and a thiol group.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the polymer-conjugated neublastin polypeptide in the<br>
composition has a longer serum half-life relative to the half-life of fee neublastin polypeptide<br>
in the absence of the polymer. Alternatively, or in addition, the polymer-conjugated<br>
neublastin polypeptide dimer in the composition binds 5FRcc, activates RET, normalizes<br>
pathological-changes of a neuron, enhances survival of a neuron, or ameliorates neuropathic<br>
pain, or performs a combination of these physiological functions. Assays for determining<br>
whether a polypeptide enhances survival of a neuron, or normalizes pathological changes of a<br>
neuron, are described in, e.g., WOOO/01815. Preferably, the neuron is a sensory neuron, an<br>
autonomic neuron, or a dopaminergic neuron.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the composition is provided as a stable, aqueous-soluble<br>
conjugated neublastin polypeptide complex comprising a neublastin polypeptide or mutated<br>
neublastin polypeptide coupled to a PEG moiety. If desired, the neublastin polypeptide or<br>
mutated neublastin polypeptide may be coupled to the PEG moiety by a labile bond. The<br>
labile bond can be cleaved in, e.g., biochemical hydrolysis, proteolysis, or sulfhydryl<br>
cleavage. For example, the bond can be cleaved under in vivo (plrysiological) conditions.<br>
Other reaction parameters, such as solvent, reaction times, temperatuites, etc., and<br>
means of purification of products, can be determined'case by case-based on the published<br>
information relating to derivatization of proteins with water soluble polymers.<br>
If desired, a single polymer molecule forconjugation per neublastin polypeptides may<br>
beemployed. Alternatively, more than one polymer molecule may be attached. Conjugated<br>
neublastin compositions of the invention may find utility in both in vivo as well as non-in<br>
29<br>
vivo applications. Additionally, it will be recognized that the conjugating polymer may<br>
utilize any other groups, moieties, or-other-conjugated -species, as appropriate to the end use<br>
application. By way of example, it may be useful in some applications to covalently bond to<br>
the polymer a functional moiety imparting UV-degradation resistance, or antioxidation, or<br>
other properties or characteristics to the polymer. As a further example, it may be<br>
advantageous in some applications to functionalize the polymer to render it reactive or erosslinkable<br>
in character, to enhance various properties or characteristics of the overall<br>
. conjugated material. Accordingly, the polymer may contain any functionality, repeating<br>
groups, linkages, or other constituent structures that do not preclude the efficacy of the<br>
conjugated neublastin mutein composition for its intended purpose.<br>
Illustrative polymers that may usefully be employed to achieve these desirable<br>
characteristics are described herein below in exemplary reaction schemes. In covalently<br>
bonded peptide applications, the polymer may be functionaUzed and then coupled to &amp;ee<br>
amino acid(s) of the peptide(s) to form labile bonds.<br>
The reactions may take place by any suitable method used for reacting biologically<br>
active materials with inert polymers, preferably at about pH 5-8, e.g., pH 5, 6, 7, or 8, if the<br>
reactive groups are on the alpha amino group at the ammo-terminus. Generally the process<br>
involves preparing an activated polymer and thereafter reacting the protein with the activated<br>
polymer to produce the soluble protein suitable for formulation. The aboVe modification<br>
reaction can be performed by several methods, which may involve one or more steps.<br>
Linear and branched forms of PEG can be used as well as other alkyl forms. The<br>
length of the PEG can be varied. Most common forms vary in size from 2BC-100 kDa. While<br>
the present examples report that targeted PEGylation at the amino-terminus does not affect<br>
pharmokinetic properties, the fact that the material retained physiological function indicates<br>
that modification at the site or sites disclosed herein is not deleterious. Consequently, in<br>
generating mutant forms of neublastin that could provide additional sites of attachment<br>
through insertion of lysine residues, the likely outcome that these forms would be PEGylated<br>
both at the lysine and at the amino-terminus is encompassed by the invention.<br>
One or more sites on a neublastin polypeptide can be coupled to a polymer. For<br>
example, one two, three, four, or Eve PEG moieties can be attached to the polypeptide. In<br>
some embodiments, a PEG moiety is attached at the amino terminus and/or amino acids 14,<br>
39, 68, and 95 of a neublastin polypeptide numbered as shown in Table 1 and SEQ ID NO:1.<br>
In advantageous embodiments, the polymer-conjugated neublastin polypeptide in the<br>
composition has a longer serum half-life relative to the half-life of the neublastin wild-type or<br>
mutated polypeptide in the absence of the polymer. Alternatively, or in addition, the<br>
polymer-conjugated neublastin polypeptide in the composition binds GFRaS, activates RET,<br>
normalizes pathological changes of a neuron, enhances survival of a neuron, or ameliorates<br>
neuropathic pain, or performs a combination of these physiological functions.<br>
In some embodiments, the mutated neublastin polypeptide or polymer conjugate in<br>
the complex has a physiological activity selected from the group consisting of: GFRaS<br>
binding, RET activation, normalization of pathological changes of a neuron, enhancing<br>
neuron survival, or ameliorating neuropathic pain.<br>
Also provided by the invention are multimeric polypeptides that include a polymerconjugated<br>
neublastin polypeptide. The multimeric polypeptides are preferably provided as<br>
purified multimeric polypeptides. Examples of multimeric-complexes include, e.g., dimeric<br>
complexes. The multimeric complex can be provided as a heteromeric or homomeric<br>
complex. Thus, the multimeric complex can be a heterodimeric polymer-conjugated<br>
polypeptide complex including one mutated neublastin polypeptide and one non-mutated<br>
neublastin or a heterodimeric polymer-conjugated polypeptide complex including two or<br>
more mutated neublastin polypeptides.<br>
In some embodiments, the polymer-conjugated neublastin polypeptide binds GFRaS.<br>
Preferably, binding of the polymer-conjugated neublastin polypeptide stimulates<br>
phosphorylation of a RET polypeptide. To determine whether a polypeptide binds GFRaS,<br>
assays can be performed as described in WOOO/01815. For example, the presence of<br>
neublastin in the media of CHO cell line supernatants-can be described using a modified form<br>
of a ternary complex assay described by Sanicola et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1997,<br>
94: 6238). In this assay, the ability of GDNF-like molecules can be evaluated for their ability<br>
to mediate binding between the extracellular domain of RET and the various co-receptors,<br>
GFRal, GFRa2, and GFRaS. Soluble forms of RET and the co-receptors are generated as<br>
nision proteins. A rusion protein between the extracellular .domain .of rat RET and placenta!<br>
alkaline phosphatase (RET-AP) and a fusion protein between the extracellular domain of tat<br>
GFRa-1 (disclosed in published application WO9744356; November 27,1997) and the Fc<br>
domain of human IgGl (rGFR(al-Jg) have been described {Sanicola et al., Pfoc. Natl. Acad.<br>
Sci. USA 1997,94:6238).<br>
The polymer of the invention is preferably a polyalkyleneglycol moiety, and more<br>
preferably a PEG moiety. Income embodiments, a polymeric moiety has an average<br>
molecular weight of about 100 Da to about 25,000 Da; of about 1000 Date about 20,000 Da;<br>
or of about 5000 Da to about 20,000 Da. In some embodiments, at least one polymeric<br>
moiety has an average molecular weight of about 5000 Da; an average molecular weight of<br>
about 10,000 Da; or an average molecular weight of about 20,000 Da.<br>
The functional group on the polyalkylene glyeol moiety can be, e.g.,<br>
carboxymethyl-NHS, norleucine-NHS, SC-PEG, tresylate, aldehyde, epoxide,<br>
carbonylimidazole, or PNP carbonate. Coupling can occur via an N-hydroxylsuccinimide<br>
(MHS) active ester. The active ester can be, e.g., PEG succinimidyl succinate<ss-></ss->
succinimidyl butyrate (SPB-PEG), or succinimidyl propionate-(SPA-PEG). In some<br>
embodiments, the polyalkylene glyeol moiety is coupled to a cysteine group of the neublastin<br>
polypeptide or mutated neublastin polypeptide. For example, coupling can occur via a<br>
maleimide group, a vinylsulfone group, a haloacetate group, and a thiol group, fa various<br>
embodiments, the neublastin polypeptide or mutated neublastin polypeptide comprises one,<br>
two, three, or four PEG moieties.<br>
In some embodiments, the polymer iscoupled to the polypeptide at a site on the<br>
neublastin that is an N terminus. In some embodiments, the polymer is coupled to the<br>
polypeptide at a site in a non-terminal amino acid of the neublastin polypeptide or mutated<br>
neublastin polypeptide. hi some embodiments, the polymer is coupled to a solvent exposed<br>
amino acid of the neublastin polypeptide or mutated neublastin polypeptide.<br>
In some embodiments, the polymer is coupled to the neublastin polypeptide or<br>
mutated neublastin polypeptide at a residue selected from the group consisting of the amino<br>
terminal amino acid of the polymer-conjugated polypeptide, position 14 in the ammo acid<br>
sequence of the neublastin polypeptide or mutated neublastin polypeptMe, position 39 in the<br>
amino acid sequence of the neublastin polypeptide or mutated neublastin polypeptide,<br>
position 68 in the amino acid sequence of the neublastin polypeptide or mutated neublastin<br>
polypeptide, and position 95 in the amino acid sequence of the neublastin polypeptide or<br>
mutated polypeptide.<br>
Polymer-conjugated neublasiin fusion proteins<br>
If desired, the polymer-conjugated neublastin polypeptide can be provided as a fusion<br>
protein. Fusion polypeptide derivatives of proteins of the invention also include various<br>
structural forms of the primary protein mat retain biological activity.<br>
Polymer-conjugated neublastin-serum albumin fusions can beconstructed using<br>
methods known in the art. Any of a number of cross-linkers that contain a corresponding<br>
amino reactive group and thiol reactive group can be Used to link neublastin to serum<br>
albumin. Examples of suitable linkers include amine reactive cross-linkers that insert a thiol<br>
reactive-maleimide. These include, e.g., SMCC, AMAS, BMPS, MBS, EMCS,"SMPB,<br>
SMPH, KMUS, or GMBS. Other suitable linkers insert a thiol reactive-haloacetate group.<br>
These include, e.g., SBAP, SIA, SIAB and that provide a protected or non protected thiol for<br>
reaction with sulfhydryl groups to product a reducible linkage are SPDP, SMPT, "SATA, or<br>
SATP all of which are commercially available {e.g., Pierce Chemicals). One skilled in the<br>
art'can similarly envision with alternative strategies that will link the amino-terminus of<br>
neublastin with serum albumin.<br>
It is also envisioned that one skilled in the art can generate conjugates to^erum<br>
albumin that are not targeted at the amino-terminus of neublastin or at the thiol moiety on<br>
serum albumin. If desired, neublastin-serum albumin fusions can be generated using genetic<br>
engineering techniques, wherein neublastin is fused to the serum albumin gene at its aminoterminus<br>
carboxy-terminus, or at both ends.<br>
Any neublastin conjugate that results in a product with a prolonged half-life, for<br>
example, in vivo or, specifically, in animals (including humans) can be generated using a<br>
similar strategy. Another example of a neublastin conjugate that results in a product with a<br>
prolonged half-life in vivo is a neublastin fusion protein where the fusion partner is an Ig.<br>
Other derivatives of polymer-conjugated neublastins include covalent or aggregate<br>
conjugates of mutated neublastin or its fragments with other proteins or polypeptides, such as<br>
by synthesis in recombinant culture as additional ammo-termini, or carboxy-termini. For<br>
example, the conjugated peptide may be a signal-(or leader) polypeptide •sequence at the<br>
amino-terminal region of the protein which co-translationally or post-translationally directs<br>
transfer of the protein from its site of synthesis to its site of function inside or outside of the<br>
cell membrane or wall (e.g., the yeast alpha.-factor leader). Neublastin receptor proteins«an<br>
comprise peptides added to facilitate purification or identification of neublastin fe,g.,<br>
histidine/neublastin fusions). The amino acid sequence of neublastin can also be linked to the<br>
peptide Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys (DYKDDDDK) (SEQ ID NO:22)tHopp^«/.,<br>
Biotechnology 6:1204 (1988)). The latter sequence is highly antigenic and provides an<br>
epitope reversibly bound by a'Specific monoclonal antibody, enabling rapid assay and-facile<br>
purification of expressed recombinant protein.<br>
This sequence is also specifically cleaved by bovine mucosalenterokinase at the<br>
residue immediately following the Asp-Lys pairing.<br>
Bioactive Polypeptides<br>
The polypeptides of the invention may be provided in any bioactive -form, including<br>
the form of pre-pro-proteins, pro-proteins, mature proteins, glycosylated proteins, nonglycosylated<br>
proteins, phosphorylated proteins, non-phosphorylated proteins, truncated<br>
forms, or any other posttranslational modified protein. A bioactive neublastin polypeptide<br>
includes a polypeptide that, for example, when dimerized, alone or in the presence of a<br>
cofactor {such as GFRccS, or RET), binds to RET, induces dimerization of RET, and<br>
autophosphorylation of RET.<br>
The polypeptides of the invention may in particular be an N-glycosylated polypeptide,<br>

residue substituted for the asparagine residue at position 95 of SEQ ID NO:2; or the amino<br>
acid sequence presented as SEQ ID NO:24, referred to herein as NBN106-N95K; or the<br>
analogous position in any mutated neublastin polypeptide when aligned by, e.g., ClustaiW<br>
computer software.<br>
This invention also includes mutated neublastin fusion proteins, such as Ig-fusions, as<br>
described, e.g., in United States patent 5,434,131, or serum albumin fusions.<br>
In some embodiments, the invention provides a polypeptide having the amino acid<br>
sequence shown as SEQ ID NO: 1 with the exception of one substitution, or an amino acid<br>
sequence that has at least about 85%, preferably at least about 9f)%, more preferably at least<br>
about 95%, more preferably at least about 9S%, and most preferably at least about 99%<br>

Biological Origin<br>
A non-conjugated neublastin polypeptide dimer can be isolated and then-conjugated<br>
to one or more polymers to obtain a polymer conjugated neublastin polypeptide dimer of the<br>
invention. The neublastin polypeptide dimer can be isolated from a mammalian cell,<br>
preferably from a human cell or from a cell of murine origin or from a cell of Chinese<br>
hamster ovary origin.<br>
Neurotrophic Activity<br>
Modified neublastin polypeptides, including truncated neublastin polypeptides, of the<br>
invention are useful for moderating metabolism, growth, differentiation, or survival tf a nerve or<br>
neuronal cell. In particular, modified neublastin polypeptides are used to treat or alleviate a<br>
disorder or disease of a living animal, e&amp;, a human, which disorder or disease is responsive<br>
to the activity of a neurotrophic agent. Such treatments and methods are described in more<br>
detail below.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions comprising neublastin-polymer conjugates<br>
Also provided is a pharmaceutical composition comprising a modified neublastin<br>
polypeptide dimer of the present invention.<br>
The polymer-neublastin conjugates of the invention may be •administered per se as<br>
well as in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable-esters, salts, and other physiologically<br>
functional derivatives thereof. Jn such pharmaceutical and medicament formulations, the<br>
polymer-conjugated neublastin conjugate preferably is utilized together with-one or more<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier(s) and optionally any other therapeutic ingredients.<br>
The carrier(s) must be pharmaceutically acceptable in the«ense of being compatible<br>
with the other ingredients of the formulation and not unduly deleterious to the tecipienl<br>
thereof. The polymer-conjugated neublastin is provided in an amount effecliveto achieve a<br>
desired pharmacological effect or medically beneficial effect, as described terein, and in a<br>
quantity appropriate to achieve the desired bioavailable in vivo dose or concentration.<br>
The formulations include those suitable for par-enteral as well as non parenteral<br>
administration, and specific administration modalities include oral, rectal, buccal, topical,<br>
nasal, ophthalmic, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, transdermal, intrathecal,<br>
intra-articular, intra-arterial, sub-arachnoid, bronchial, lymphatic, vaginal, and ultra-uterine<br>
administration. Formulations suitable for aerosol andparenteral administration, both locally<br>
and systemically, are preferred.<br>
When the polymer-conjugated neublastin is utilized in a formulation comprising a<br>
liquid solution, the formulation advantageously may be administered orally, bronchially, or<br>
parenterally. When the polymer-conjugated neublastin is employed in a liquid suspension<br>
formulation or as a powder in a biocompatible carrier formulation, the formulation may be<br>
advantageously administered orally, rectally, or bronchially. Alternatively, it may be<br>
administered nasally or bronchially, via nebulization of the powder in a carrier gas, to form a<br>
gaseous dispersion of the powder that is inspired by the patient from a breathing circuit<br>
comprising a suitable nebulizer device.<br>
The formulations comprising the proteins of the present invention may conveniently<br>
be presented in unit dosage forms and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in<br>
the art of pharmacy. Such methods generally include the step of bringing the active<br>
ingredients) into association with a carrier that constitutes one or more accessory<br>
ingredients.<br>
Typically, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing the<br>
active ingredient(s) into association with a liquid carrier, a finely divided solid carrier, or<br>
both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into dosage forms of the desired<br>
formulation.<br>
Formulations of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be<br>
presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets, tablets, or lozenges, each comprising a<br>
predetermined amount of the active ingredient as a powder or granules; or a suspension in an<br>
aqueous liquor or a non-aqueous liquid, such as a syrup, an elixir, an emulsion, or a-draught.<br>
Formulations suitable for parenteral administration convenientlycomprise a-sterfle<br>
aqueous preparation of the active conjugate, which preferably is isotonic with the blood of<br>
the recipient {e.g., physiological saline solution). Such formulations may include suspending<br>
agents and thickening agents or other microparticulate systems which are designed to target<br>
the compound to blood components or one or more organs. The formulations ma)' be<br>
presented in unit-dose or multi-dose form.<br>
Nasal spray formulations comprise purified aqueous solutions of the active conjugate<br>
with preservative agents and isotonic agents. Such formulations are preferably adjusted to a<br>
pH and isotonic state compatible with the nasal mucus membranes.<br>
Formulations for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with a<br>
suitable carrier such as cocoa butter, hydrogenated fats, or hydrogenated fatty carboxyiic<br>
3S<br>
acid. Ophthalmic formulations such as eye drops are prepared by a similar method to the<br>
nasal spray, except that the pH and isotonic factors are preferably adjusted to match that of<br>
the eye.<br>
Topical formulations comprise the conjugates of the invention dissolved or suspended<br>
in one or more media, such as mineral oil, petroleum, polyhydroxy alcohols, or other bases<br>
used for topical pharmaceutical formulations.<br>
In addition to the aforementioned ingredients, the formulations of this invention may<br>
further include one or more accessory ingredients) selected from diluents, buffers, flavoring<br>
agents, disintegrants, surface active agents, thickeners, lubricants, preservatives (including<br>
antioxidants), and the like. The foregoing considerations apply also to the neublastin fusion<br>
proteins of the invention (e.g., neublastin-human serum albumin fusion proteins).<br>
Accordingly, the present invention includes the provision of suitable fusion proteins<br>
for in vitro "stabilization of a polymer-conjugated neublastin conjugate in-solution, as a<br>
preferred illustrative application of the invention. The fusion proteins may be employed for<br>
example to increase the resistance to enzymatic degradation of the polymer-conjugated<br>
neublastin polypeptide and provides a means of improving shelf life, room temperature<br>
stability, and the like. It is understood that the foregoing considerations apply also to the<br>
neublastin-serum albumin fusion proteins (including the human neublastin-human serum<br>
albumin fusion proteins) of the invention.<br>

2. Treatment of Tactile Allodynia<br>
The term "tactile allodynia" typically refers to theicondition in a subject where pain is<br>
evoked by stimulation of the skin (e.g. touch) that is normally innocuous. This invention<br>
includes a method for treating tactile allodynia in a subject.<br>
In some-embodiments, tactile allodynia is treated by administering to the subject a<br>
pharmaceutically effective amount of a polymer conjugated mutated neublastin poiypeptide<br>
dimer alone.<br>
hi a related embodiment, the invention includes a method for treating tactile allodynia<br>
in a subject, either by administering to the subject an effective amount of a polymer<br>
conjugated neublastin polypeptide dimer containing truncated wild-type or mutated<br>
neublastin polypeptides, including, e.g., at least one of SEQ ID NOS:1,2,6-21 and 3t&gt; or a<br>
mutated form thereof, either alone, or by administering to the-subject an effective amount of a<br>
neublastin polypeptide with an effective amount of an analgesia-inducing compound selected<br>
from the group consisting of opioids, aiiti-arrhythmics, topical analgesics, local anaesthetics,<br>
anticonvulsants, antidepressants, corticosteroids and NSAJDS. M a preferred embodiment,<br>
the analgesia-inducing compound is an anticonvulsant. hi another preferred -embodiment, .the<br>
analgesia-inducing compound isgabapentin((l-aminomethyl)cyclohexane acetic acid) or<br>
pregabalin (S-(+)-4-amino-3-(2-methylpropyl)butanoic acid).<br>
m some embodiments, a polymer conjugated mutated neublastin polypeptide dimer is<br>
administered in association with a therapeutic agent, including but not limited to an anti-<br>
cancer agent or an anti-viral agent. Anti-cancer agents include, but are not limited to, taxol,<br>

3. Treatment for Reduction of Loss of Pain Sensitivity<br>
In another embodiment, the invention includes a method for reducing the loss of pain<br>
sensitivity in a subject afflicted with a neuropathy. In a preferred embodiment, the<br>
neuropathy is diabetic neuropathy. In a preferred-embodiment, the loss of pain sensitivity is a<br>
loss in thermal pain sensitivity. This invention-contemplates both prophylactic and<br>
therapeutic treatment.<br>
In prophylactic treatment, a polymer conjugated mutated neubiastin polypeptide<br>
dimer is administered to a subject at risk of developing loss of pain sensitivity; such subjects<br>
would be expected to be subjects with an-early-stage neuropathy. The treatment with<br>
neublastin under such circumstances would serve to treat at-risk patients preventively.<br>
hi therapeutic treatment, a polymer conjugated mutated neublastin polypeptide dimer<br>
is administered to a subject who has experienced loss of pain-sensitivity as a result of<br>
affliction with a neuropathy; 'such subjects would be expected to be -subjects with a late stage<br>
neuropathy. The treatment with a polymer conjugated mutated neublastin polypeptide dimer<br>
under such circumstances would serve to rescue appropriate pain sensitivity in the subject.<br>
4. Treatment of Viral Infections and Viral-Associated Neuropathies<br>
Prophylactic treatment of infectious and viral neuropathies is contemplated.<br>
Prophylactic treatment is indicated after determination of viral infection and before onset of<br>
neuropathic pain. During treatment, a polymer conjugated mutated neublastin polypeptide<br>
dimer is administered to prevent appearance of neuropathic pain including but not limited to<br>
neuropathic pain associated with leprosy, Lyme disease, neuropathic pain associated with<br>
infection by a virus, particularly a. virus selected from the group consisting of a herpes virus<br>
(and more particularly by a herpes zoster virus, which may lead to post-herpetic neuralgia), a<br>
human immunodeficiency virus {HIV), and a papilloma virus). In an alternative<br>
embodiment, a polymer conjugated mutated neublastin polypeptide dimer is administered to<br>
reduce the severity of neuropathic pain, should it appear.<br>
"Symptoms of acute viral infection often include the appearance of a rash. Other<br>
symptoms include, for example, the development of persistent pain in the affected area of tiie<br>
body, which is a common-complication of a herpes zoster infection (shingles). Post-herpetic<br>
neuralgia can last For a month or more, and may appear -several months after any rash-like<br>
-symptoms have disappeared.<br>
5. Treatment of Painful Diabetic Neuropathy<br>
Prophylactic treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy is contemplated. Prophylactic<br>
treatment of diabetic neuropathies would commence after determination of the initial<br>
diagnosis of diabetes or diabetes-associated symptoms and before onset of neuropathic pain.<br>
Prophylactic treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy may also commence upon determining<br>
that a subject is at risk for developing diabetes or diabetes-associated symptoms. During<br>
treatment, a polymer-conjugated mutated neublastin polypeptide dimer is administered to<br>
prevent appearance of neuropathic pain. In an alternative embodiment, a polymer conjugated<br>
mutated neublastin polypeptide dimer is administered to reduce theseverity of neuropathic<br>
pain that has already appeared.<br>
6. Nervous System Disorders<br>
Jn a further aspect, the invention provides a method of treating or preventing a<br>
nervous system disorder in a subject (such as a human), by administering to a subject in need<br>
thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a polymer-conjugated neublastin polypeptide, a<br>
composition containing a neublastin polypeptide or mutated neublastin polypeptide-coupled<br>
to a polymer, or a complex that includes a stable, aqueous soluble conjugated neublastin<br>
polypeptide or mutated neublastin polypeptide complex comprising a neublastin polypeptide<br>
or mutated neublastin polypeptide coupled to a poiyalkylene moiety such as, e.g., PEG.<br>
The nervous system disorder can be a peripheral nervous system disorder, such as a<br>
peripheral neuropathy or a neuropathic pain syndrome. Humans are preferred subjects for<br>
treatment.<br>
A polymer-conjugated neublastin polypeptide dimer t&gt;f the invention is useful for<br>
Seating a defect in a neuron, including without limitation lesioned neurons and traumatized<br>
neurons. Peripheral nerves that experience trauma include, but are not limited to, nerves of<br>
the medulla or of the spinal .cord. Inventive polymer-conjugated neublastin polypeptide<br>
dimers are useful in the treatment of neurodegenerative disease, e.g., cerebral ischemic<br>
neuronal damage; neuropathy, e.g., peripheral neuropathy, Alzheimer's disease, Ftuntington's<br>
disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Such neublastin<br>
polypeptide dimers can be used in the treatment of impaired memory, e.g., memory<br>
impairment associated withtternentia.<br>
Additional-examples of-conditions or diseases are disorders of the peripheral nervous<br>
system, the medulla, or the spinal cord, as well as trauma-induced neuropathies,<br>
chemotherapy-induced neuropathies, toxin-induced neuropathies, 
vitamin-deficiency-induced neuropathies; idiopathic neuropathies; and diabetic neuropathies,<br>
neuropathic pain associated with toxin-induced nerve damage, pathogen-induced nerve<br>
damage, inflammation-induced nerve damage, or neurodegeneration. An inventive<br>
neublastin polypeptide dimer is additionally useful for treating neuropathic pain, for teeating<br>
tactile allodynia and for reducing loss of pain sensitivity associated with neuropathy.<br>

weight of the subject, per dose, e.g., from 3 ng/kg to 10 (ig/kg body weight of fee subject, per<br>
dose. Therapeutically'effective amounts of the formulation of the invention may be<br>
administer-ed to a subject in need thereof in a dosage regimen ascertainable by one of skill in<br>
the art, without undue experimentation..<br>
. 8. Delivery<br>
The polypeptide dimer used in the foregoing methods can be administered via any<br>
suitable delivery system, and preferably from the group consisting of intravenous delivery,<br>
intramuscular delivery, intrapulmonary delivery, subcutaneous delivery, and interaperitoneal<br>
delivery, most preferably via intramuscular delivery, intravenous delivery, or subcutaneous<br>
delivery. The neublastin polypeptide used in the foregoing methods can also be administered<br>
via intrathecal delivery.<br>
Administration of a polymer-conjugated neublastin polypeptide dimer can be, e.g.,<br>
-systemic or local. The formulations include those suitable for parenteral as well asnon<br>
parenteral administration, and specific administration modalities include oral, rectal, buccal,<br>
topical, nasal, ophthalmic, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, transdermal, intralhecal,<br>
intra-articular, intra-arterial, sub-arachnoid, bronchial, lymphatic, vaginal, and intra-uterine<br>
administration. Formulations-suitable for aerosol and patenteral administration, both locally<br>
and systemically, are included. Preferred formulations are suitable for subcutaneous,<br>
intramuscular, or intravenous administration.<br>
8. Regimes<br>
In some embodiments, the frequency of dosing for the polypeptide dimer of the<br>
invention provides for administering to the subject a formulation three times a week for two<br>
weeks. In order to optimize therapeutic efficacy, a polymer conjugated mutated neublastin<br>
polypeptide dimer is first administered at different dosing regimens. The unit dose and<br>
regimen depend on factors that include, &amp;g., the species of mammal immunized, its immune<br>
status, the body weight of the mammal. Typically, protein levels in tissue are monitored<br>
using appropriate screening assays as part of a clinical testing procedure, e.g., to determine<br>
the efficacy of a given treatment regimen.<br>
The frequency of dosing for a polymer conjugated mutated neublastin polypeptide<br>
dimer of this invention is within the skills and clinical judgement of physicians. Typically,<br>
the administration regime is established by clinical trials which may-establish optimal<br>
administration parameters. However, the practitioner may vary such administration regimes<br>
according to the subject's age, health, weight, sex and medical status. The frequency of<br>
dosing may also vary between acute and-chronic treatments for neuropathy, hi addition, the<br>
frequency of dosing may be varied depending on whether the treatment is prophylactic or<br>
therapeutic.<br>
The invention is further illustrated in the following non-limiting examples.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1: Unavailability of ammo-terminal PEGylated Neublastin<br>
GHO cell - and E. coli - derived recombinant neublastins were observed to be rapidly<br>
cleared from circulation if administered intravenously in rats. The proteins were below the<br>
threshold of .detection in the serum following subcutaneous administration. To increase<br>
bioavailability of neublastin, PEGylated forms of mutated neublastin were constructed.<br>
Because no lysines occur in the neubiastin sequence, amine-specific PEGylation<br>
chemistries will result in PEGylation of a wild-type neublastin polypeptide at its amino<br>
terminus. Thus, for each neublastin dimer, two PEG moieties should be attached.<br>
Accordingly, PEG forms were first directly targeted to the ammo-terminus through amine<br>
specific chemistries. Surprisingly, PEGylation of E. coli expressed wild-type neublastin, -even<br>
with two 20 kDa PEGs attached, had little benefit on half life, indicating that a mechanism<br>
based clearance pathway was overriding the enhancement in half life that was expected to be<br>
achieved by PEGylation.<br>
Example 2: Construction of a PEGylated Mutated Neublastin (N95K)<br>
The bioavailability of mutated neublastin forms PEGylated at internal amino acid<br>
residues was next examined. A series of four mutants replacing naturally occurring residues<br>
at positions 14,39,68, and 95, when numbered as shown in SEQ ID NO:1, were designed to<br>
insert lysines at selected sites in the sequence. These lysines would provide alternative sites<br>
for PEG attachment These sites were selected using the crystal structure of GDNF (Nat.<br>
Struct Biol. 4: 435-8, 1997) as a framework to identify surface residues. The persephin/<br>
neublastin chimera mutagenesis study (J. Biol. Chem. 275: 3412-20,2000) was used to<br>
identify functionally important regions of the structure that should be avoided.<br>
In order to express the wild-type neuWastin-gene in E. cdi, syngenes were<br>
constructed with lower GC content and preferred E. coli codons. The syngene was cloned<br>
into two vectors, pET19b and pMJB164, a derivative of pET19b. In pET19b, the sequence<br>
encoding the mature domain of neublastin (NBN113) is directly fused to an initiating<br>
methionine. hi pMJB164, the mature domain of neublastin is fused to a histidine tag {ill. 10<br>
histidines) and separated from the histidine tag by an enterokinase cleavage site (SEQ ID<br>
NOs: 35 and 36). The initiating methionine precedes the histidine tag.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Two of the mutations<r39 andtr68 were targeted at a region that based on the></r39>
distribution of positive-charges on the surface, might represent a heparin binding site. This<br>
site likely contributes to the -rapid clearance of the protein. A third site was targeted at HP'S,<br>
the natural glycosylation site in wild-type neublastin. This site is naturally modified with a<br>
complex carbohydrate structure. Therefore, modification with PEG at this-site was not<br>
expected to impact function. The fourth site {R14) was selected in a region that was not<br>
covered by any other of the modifications. A mutant in which the asparagine residue at<br>
position 95 was replaced with a lysine (the "N95K mutant") was chosen for the studies<br>
disclosed herein.<br>
Four different mutated rat neublastins comprising one or more alterations in the<br>
wild-type sequence of rat neublastin polypeptide were constructed. These mutated<br>
neublastins contained single amino acid substitutions: R14K; R68K; R39K; or N95K. Table<br>
1A identifies these exemplary point mutations in bold. In the "XiNiX2" nomenclature, Xi<br>
refers to an amino acid of a wild-type neublastin polypeptide, NI refers to the numerical<br>
position of the Xi amino acids in the sequence, as numbered according to SEQ ID NO:1, and<br>
Xa refers to an amino acid substituted for the wild-type amino acid at the indicated numerical<br>
position NI.<br>
To construct the rat N95K neublastin mutation, site-directed mutagenesis was<br>
performed on pCMB020, a plasmid encoding wild-type rat neublastin. The wild-type rat<br>
neublastin nucleic and the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide encoded thereby are<br>

Expression and Characterization of Mutated Neublastin in E. coli<br>
For expression and purification, a plasmid encoding the rat neublastin N95K<br>
polypeptide was expressed in E. coli as a Hjs-tagged fusion protein wifli an-entelokinase<br>
-cleavage site immediately adjacent to the start of the mature 113 amino acid neublastin<br>
sequence. The E. coti was grown in a 500 L fermentor and frozen cell paste was provided.<br>
The E. coli cells were lysed in a APV Gaulin Press and the rat neublastin N95K recovered<br>
from the insoluble washed pellet fraction.<br>
The N95K mutated neublastin was extracted from the pellet with guanidine<br>
hydrochloride, refolded, and the His-tag removed with enterdkinase (see Example 5). The<br>
product was then subjected to chromatography on Ni NTA agarose (Qiagen) and on<br>
Bakerbond WP CBX cation exchange resin.<br>
Bnterokinase treatment of the His tagged product resulted in an aberrant cleavage of<br>
the protein at arginine 7 in the mature sequence. The resulting des 1-7 neublastin product<br>
(NBN106-N95K) was fully active in the KCRA ELISA and structurally indistinguishable<br>
from the mature form in its susceptibility to guanidine-induced denaturation and therefore<br>
was used for subsequent work.<br>
Rat mutated neublastin NBN106-N95K was PEGylated at an average of 3.3 PEG<br>
moieties per neublastin molecule using methoxylpoly(ethylene glycol)-succinimidyl<br>
propionate (SPA-PEG) with a molecular mass of 10,000 Da as the reactant. The resulting<br>
PEGylated product was subjected to extensive characterization including analysis by<br>
SDS-PAtjE, size exclusion chromatography (SEC), reverse phase HPLC, matrix assisted<br>
laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALD/IMS), peptide mapping, assessment of<br>
activity in the KIRA ELISA, and determination of endotoxin content. The purity of the<br>
neublastin N95K product prior to PEGylation as measured by SDS-PAGE and SEC was<br>
greater than 95%. The neublastin N95K product migrated under nonreducing-conditions as a<br>
dimer, consistent with its predicted structure. After PEGylation, the resulting product<br>
consisted of a series of modified adducts comprising 2 PEGs per molecule, which was 5% of<br>
the product, 3 PEGs per molecule, which was 60% of the product, 4 PEGs per molecule,<br>
which was 30% of the product, and several minor forms of higher mass. In the PEGylated<br>
sample there was no evidence of aggregates. Residual levels of unmodified neublastin in the<br>
product were below the limits of quantitation. The endotoxin content of the material is<br>
routinely less than 1 EU/mg. The specific activity of the PEGylated neublastin in the KIRA<br>
ELISA is 10 nM. The PEGylated product was formulated at 1.1 mg/mL in PBS pH 6.5. The<br>
material, which is similar in potency to wild-type neublastin (NBN113),-can he-supplied as a<br>
frozen liquid, which is stored at -70°C.<br>
51<br>
The R14K, R39K, and &amp;6BK mutated neublastin polypeptides were expressed in E.<br>
i and-can be subjected to the same methods for purification, PEGylation and assessment of<br>
function as described above for the NBN106-N95K neublastin.<br>
Preparation of PEGylated Mutated Neublastin NBN106-N9SK<br>
230 mL of the refolded rat N95K mutated neublastin (2.6 mg/mL) that had been<br>
produced in E. coli and stored at 4°C in 5 mM sodium phosphate pH 6.5,100 mM NaCl was<br>
diluted with 77 mL of water, 14.4 mL of 1M HEPES pH7.5, and 2.8 g (10 mg/mL final) of<br>
PEG SPA 10,000 Da (Shearwater Polymers, Inc.). The sample was incubated at room<br>
temperature for 4 hours in the dark, then treated with 5 mM imidazole {final), filtered, and<br>
stored overnight at 4°C. The product was generated in two batches one containing 130 mL of<br>
the N95K bulk and the other containing 100 mL of the bulk. The PEGylated neublastin was<br>
purified from the reaction mixture on Fractogel EMD SOa" (M) (EM Industries). The column<br>
was run at room temperature. All buffers were prepared pyrogen free. Sodium chloride was<br>
added to the reaction mixture to a final concentration of 87 mM and the sample was loaded<br>
onto a 45 mL Fractogel column (5 cm internal diameter).<br>
The column was washed with one column volume of 5 mM •sodium phosphate pHtf.5,<br>
80 mM NaCl, then with three one column volume aliquots of 5 mM sodium phosphate<br>
containing 50 mM NaCl. The resin was transferred into a 2.5 cm diameter column and the<br>
PEGylated neublastin was eluted from the column with six ten mL steps containing 5 mM<br>
sodium phosphate pH.6.5,400 mM NaCl, three steps containing 500 mL NaCl, and six steps<br>
containing 600 mM NaCl. Elution fractions were analyzed for protein content by absorbance<br>
at 280 ran and then for extent of modification by SDS-PAGE. Selected fractions were<br>
pooled, filtered through a 0.2 |J,m filter, and diluted with water to 1.1 mg PEGylated rat<br>
neublastin/mL. After assessing endotoxin levels in the individual batches, they were pooled<br>
and refiltered through a 0.2 fim membrane. The final material was aliquoted and stored at -<br>
70°C.<br>
DV Spectrum of Purified PEGylated Mutated Neublastin NBW106-N95K<br>
The UV spectrum (240-340 nm) of PEGylated NBN N95K was taken on the neat<br>
sample. The sample was analyzed in triplicate. The PEGylated sample exhibited an<br>
absorbance maximum at 275-217 nm and an absorbance minimum at 247-249. This result is<br>
consistent with what is observed on thetmlk intermediate. The protein concentration of tiie<br>
PEGylated product was -estimated from the spectrum using an extinction coefficient of<br>
Z28o°'1%=0.50. The protein concentration of the PEGylated neublastin bulk is Llmg/mL. No<br>
turbidity was present in the sample as evident by the lack of absorbanee at 320 nm.<br>
Characterization of PEGylated Mutated Neublastin NBN106-N95K by<br>
SDS-PAGE<br>
Aliquots of PEGylated neublastin containing 3,1.5,0.75, and 0.3 .fig of the product<br>
were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 4-20% gradient gel (Owl). The gel was stained with<br>
Goomassie brilliant blue R-250. Molecular weight markers (GIBCO-BRL) were run in<br>
parallel.<br>
SDS-PAGE analysis of PEGylated mutated neublastin NBN106-N95K under non<br>
reducing conditions revealed a series of bands corresponding to modifications with 2,3,4,<br>
and more than 4 PEGs per molecule. The major band with apparent mass of 98 kDa contains<br>
3 PEGs per molecules. In the purified PEGylated product, non-PEGylated neublastin was not<br>
detected. The presence of a mixture of products with 2,3 and 4 PEGS attached was verified<br>
by MALDI mass spectrometric analysis. The ratio of product containing 2,3, and 4 PEGs<br>
was determined by densitometry and determined to be 7,62, and 30 percent of the total,<br>
respectively.<br>
Characterization of PEGylated Mutated Neublastin NBN106-N95KBy Size<br>
Exclusion Chromatography<br>
PEGylated mutated neublastin NBN106-N95K was subjected to -size exclusion<br>
chromatography on an analytical Superose 6 HR1O/30 FPLC column using 5 mM MES pH<br>
6.5, 300 mM NaCl as the mobile phase. The column was run at 20 mL/h. Elution fractions<br>
were monitored for absorbanee at 280 nm. The PEGylated mutated neublastin eluted as a<br>
single peak with an apparent molecular weight of about 200 kDa consistent with the large<br>
hydrodynamic volume of the PEG. :Nb evidence of aggregates was observed. Free<br>
neublastin, which elutes with an apparent molecular mass of about SOkDa, was not detected<br>
in the preparation.<br>
Analysis of PEGj'lated Mutated Neublastin NENlftS-NPSKby Reverse Phase<br>
HPLC<br>
PEGylated mutated neublastin NBN106-N95K was subjected to reverse phase &amp;PLC<br>
on a Vydac €4 (5 urn, 1 x 250 mm)-column. The column was developed using a€0 mm<br>
gradient from 40 to 60% B (Buffer A: 0.1% TFA, Buffer B: 75% acetonkrile/0.085% TFA).<br>
The column efSuent was monitored for absorbanee at 214 nm and fractions collected for<br>
subsequent analysis. PEGylated NBN106-N95K was fractionated into its various di (60.5<br>
nan), tri {63.3 mm), and tetra (67.8 mm) PEGylated components by r-everse phase fiPLC on a<br>
C4 column. The relative intensities of the peaks suggest that the ratios of fee components are<br>
5.4, 60.5, and 30.1 %, respectively. Peak identities were verified by MALDI-MS. There was<br>
no evidence of non-PEGylated NBN106-N95K (elutes at 5-15 mm) in the product.<br>
Analysis of PEGylated Mutated Neublastin NBN106-N95K by Mass<br>
Spectrometry<br>
PEGylated mutated neublastin NBN106-N95K was desalted on a C4 Zip Tip and<br>
analyzed by mass spectrometry on a Voyager-DE™ STR (PerSeptive Biosystems)<br>
matrix-assisted laser desorption/ ionization time-of- fh'ght{MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer<br>
using sinapinic acid as a matrix. 0.5 \\L of the purified protein was mixed with 0.5 \\L of<br>
matrix on the target plate. Mass spectrometry of PEGylated mutated neublastin NBN106-<br>
N95K revealed singly and doubly charged forms of three adducts. The observed masses of<br>
43803 Da, 54046 Da, and 64438 Da are consistent with modifications of 2,3, and 4 PEGs per<br>
molecule.<br>
Analysis of PEGylated Mutated Neublastin NBN106-N95K by Peptide Mapping<br>
The specificity of the PEGylation reaction was evaluated by peptide mapping.<br>
PEGylated neublastin was separated into di, tri, and tetra PEGylated components, which were<br>
then reduced, alkylated, and further separated into their single chain components by HPLC on<br>
a €4 column. These components and reduced and alkylated non-PEGylated NBN106-N95K<br>
as a-control were digested with Asp-N proteinase and the resulting cleavage products were<br>
fractionated by reversed phase HPLC on a Vydac Cig (5 ^m, 1 x 25t) mm) column using a 60<br>
mm gradient from 0 to 60% B (Buffer A: 0.1% TFA, Buffer B: 75% acetorutrik/0.085%<br>
TFA). Thecolumn effluent was monitored for absorbance at 214 mm.<br>
The rat neublastin sequence contains five internal aspartic acids and therefore was<br>
expected to yield a simple cleavage profile when digested with endoproteinase Asp-N. All^f<br>
the peaks from the Asp-N digest of rat K95K have been, identified by mass spectrometry<br>
and/or Edman amino-terminal sequencing and thus the peptide map -can be used as asimple<br>
tool to probe for the sites of modification by the presence or absence of a peak. The identity<br>
of the various peaks are summarized below in Table 7.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
due to oxidation of methionine containing peptide on MALDI.<br>
Since neublastin naturally exists as a homodimer, the rat mutated neublastin NBN106-<br>
N95K product contains four potential sites for PEGylation, the two amino-tenninal amines<br>
from each of the chains and the two N95K sites that were engineered into the construct. In<br>
the peptide map of the di-PEGylated chain, only the peak that contains the peptide with the<br>
N95K mutation was altered by the PEG modification. None of the other peaks were afifected<br>
by the PEG modification. The mapping data therefore indicate that the PEG moiety is<br>
specifically attached to this peptide and not to any of the other peptides mat were-screened.<br>
The second potential site of attachment, the ammo-terminus is on a peptide that is only three<br>
amino acids long and is not detected in the peptide map. It is inferred that additional PEG<br>
attachments are at this site. Consistent with this notion, a small percentage of the rat mutated<br>
neublastin N95K is not truncated and contains the mature Ala-1 sequence. This peptide<br>
elutes at 30 jam and is visible in the peptide map from the non-PEGylated digest, but is absent<br>
from the PEGylated mutated neublastin NBN106-N95K digests.<br>
Example 3: Assessing the Potency of Internally PEGylated Mutated Neublastin<br>
NBN106-N95K in a Kinase Receptor Activation (tORA) ELISA<br>
The potency of PEGylated mutated rat neublastin was measured using neublastin<br>
dependent activation/ phosphorylation of c-Ret as a reporter for neublastin activity in an<br>
ELISA that was specific for the presence of phosphorylated RET. NB41 A3-mRL3 cells, an<br>
adherent murine neuroblastoma cell line which expresses Ret and GFRocS, were plated at 2 x<br>
10s cells per well in 24-well plates in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM),<br>
supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum, and .cultured for 18 h at 37 °C and 5 % CO2.<br>
The cells were washed with PBS, and treated with serial dilutions of neublastin in<br>
0.25 mL of DMEM for 10 min at 37 °C and 5 % C02. Each sample was analyzed hi<br>
duplicate. The cells were washed with 1 mL of PBS, and lysedfor Ih at 4 °C with 0.30 mL<br>
of 10 mM Tris HC1, pH 8.0,0.5 % Nonidet P40,0.2 %-sodium deoxycholate, 50 mM NaF,<br>
0.1 mM Na3 VC4,1 mM phenylnaethylsulfonyl fluoride with gently rocking the plates. The<br>
lysates were further agitated by repeated pipetting and 0.25 mL of sample was transferred to a<br><br><br>
96-well ELISA plate that had been coated with 5 µg/mL of anti-Ret mAb (AA.GE7.3) in 50 mM carbonate buffer, pH 9.6 at 4°C for 18 h, and blocked at room temperature for one hour with block buffer (20 mM Tris HC1 pH 7.5,150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20 (TEST)<br>
containing 1 % normal mouse serum and 3 % bovine serum albumin).<br>
After a 2 h incubation at room temperature, the wells were washed 6-times<br>
with TBST. Phosphorylated Ret was detected by incubating the wells at room<br>
temperature for 2 h with 2µg/mL of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-<br>
phosphotyrosine 4G10 antibody in block buffer, washing 6-times with TBST, and<br>
measuring HRP activity at 450 nm with a colorometric detection reagent. The<br>
absorbance values from wells treated with lysate or with lysis buffer were measured and<br>
the background corrected signal was plotted as a function of the concentration of<br>
neublastin present in the activation mixture. The potency of PEGylated mutated<br>
neublastin (3(,4)X10 kDa PEG NBN106-N95K) in the KIRA ELISA was<br>
indistinguishable from that of the wild-type NBN113 material	(Table 8).<br>
There was no effect of two freeze-thaw cycles bn potency and following this treatment<br>
there was no significant increase in the turbidity of the sample, indicating that the<br>
samples can be safely thawed for the study. In independent studies accessing the activity<br>
of product with three and four 10 kDa PEGs per molecule separately, it was determined<br>
that the adduct with three PEGs was fully active, while the four PEG product had reduced<br>
potency	(Table 8). These data demonstrate that 3,(4) X 10 kDa PEG NBN106-<br>
N95K        -     and 3 X 10 kDa PEG NBN106-N95K	-activate Ret to a similar<br>
extent and with the same dose-dependence as non-mutated (wild-type) neublastin,<br>
NBN113. However, although 4X10 kDa PEG NBN106-N95K 	activates Ret to<br>
a similar extent as non-mutated (wild-type) NBN113, 4X10 kDa PEG NBN106-N95K is<br>
approximately 10-fold less potent than non-mutated (wild-type) NBN113 in activating Ret. Estimated EC50's are provided in Table 8.<br>
Example 4: Pharmokinetic Studies of Internally PEGylated Mutated Rat Neublastin<br>
NBN106-N95K in Rats and Mice<br>
The pharmokinetic properties of various PEGylated and non-PEGylated mutated neublastin products in rat and mouse models were examined (see Table 8 for summary of results).<br>
The data revealed that PEGylation of rat mutated neublastin NBN1-06-N95K with 3.3, 10000 Da PEGs resulted in a-significant effect on the half life and bioavailability of the neublastin. Following a 1 mg/kg IV administration in sprague Dawley rats, peak levels of<br><br>
PEGylated mutated neublastin of 3000 ng/mL were detected after 7 minutes, and levels of<br>
700 ng/mL were detected after 24 h, 200 ng/mL after 4? h, and 100 ng/mL after 72 h. In<br>
contrast for non-PEGylated mutated neublastin N95K following a 1 mg/kg IV administration,<br>
levels of 1500 ng/mL were detected after 7 minutes, but then the levels quickly dropped to 70<br>
ng/mL after 3 h and were not detectable after 7 h. The effects of PEGylation wereeven more<br>
pronounoed in animals treated with PEGylated neublastin by subcutaneous administration.<br>
Following a 1 rag/kg s.c. administration, circulating levels of PEGylated neublastin<br>
reached a maximum of 200 ng/mL after 24 h and remained at this level for the duration of the<br>
three day study. In contrast, no detectable neublastin was observed at any time point<br>
following administration of non-PEGylated mutated neublastin.<br>
The analysis of the PEGylated N95K samples are complicated by the presence of<br>
adducts comprising 2, 3 and 4 PEGs per molecule, which each will display a different PK<br>
profile. In early PK studies, mice were used to facilitate screening through a variety of<br>
candidates and routes of administration. The mouse studies revealed dramatic difierences in<br>
the bioavailability of the candidates. However, when the 3.3 IDkDaPEGadductwas<br>
evaluated in rats, it was found to be less bioavailable in rats than it was in mice. This<br>
difference in bioavailability was particularly pronounced following i.p. administration.<br>
Levels in mice reached 1600 ng/mL after 7 hr and remained at 400 ng/mL after 24 hr. In<br>
contrast, rat levels were constant at 100 ng/mL for 4-48 hr.<br>
Two surprising and unexpected results emerged from the PfC studies summarized in<br>
Table 8: 1) PEGylation of the amino-terminal ammo acids of non-glycosylated neublastin<br>
was not sufficient to increase serum exposure substantially; and 2) PEGylation of the aminoterminal<br>
amino acid(s) of neublastin together with modification *(e.g. PEGylation or<br>
glycosylation) of amino acid 95 was sufficient to increase serum exposure substantially. For<br>
example, glycosylated NBN104*(CHO) gave no detectable exposure after s.c. administration;<br>
hov/ever, glycosylated 1X20 kDaPEGNBN104 (CHO)gave high serum exposure after s.c.<br>
administration. Similarly, 2X20 kDa PEG MBN113 gave low-to-moderate serum exposure<br>
after s.c. administration; however, glycosylated 2X20 kDa PEG NBN104 (CHO) gave high<br>
serum exposure after s.c. administration. These results indicated that polymer conjugation of<br>
the amino-terminal amino acid(s) of neublastin together with either polymer conjuation of an<br>
internal amino acid (e.g. at position 95) or glycosylation at an internal amino acid (e.g. at<br>
position 95) results in substantially increased serum exposure after-systemic administration.<br>
Both wild-type rat neublastin and mutated neublastin N95K were refolded and<br>
purified to &gt;95% for efficacy tests in the STZ diabetic rat neuropathy model. Wild-type<br>
neublastin was formulated to go directly into animal testing while N95K was prepared for<br>
PEGylation with 10 kDa PEG-SPA. To accomplish the refolding and purification goal, a<br>
refolding method utilizing size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was developed that<br>
permitted the renaturation of neublastin from E. coli inclusion bodies in large quantities and<br>
at high concentrations. In addition to SEC, both Ni-NTA and -CM silica column<br>
chromatography steps were employed to increase the final protein purity. The proteins were<br>
subjected to extensive characterization including analysis bySDS-PAGE, size exclusion<br>
chromatography, ESMS, assessment of activity by KIRA ELIS A, and determination of<br>
endotoxin content SDS-PAGE and SEC of the final protein products indicated a purity of<br>
greater than 95%. The endotoxin level of each product was 
activity of both proteins in the KIRA ELIS A is approximately 10 nM. Wild-type neublastin<br>
was formulated at 1.0 mg/ml and N95K was formulated at 2.6 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered<br>
saline (PBS) pH6.5. Wild-type neublastin was aliquoted into 15 ml tubes and stored frozen at<br>
70°C while N95K was subjected to PEGylation prior to aliquoting and freezing.<br>
Examples: Refolding and Purification of a Wild-Type Neublastin and the Mutated<br>
NPSKNeublastin<br>
Both neublastin forms were expressed in E. coli as Histidine (His)-tagged fusion<br>
proteins with an enterokinase cleavage site immediately adjacent to the-start of the mature<br>
113 amino acid sequence. Bacteria expressing either wild-type (1.8 kg pellet) or N95K (2.5<br>
kg pellet) neublastin were subjected to lysis in 2 liters of PBS using a APV Gaulin Pcess.<br>
Following •centrifugation (10,000 rpm) to pellet the inclusion bodies, the supernatants from<br>
-each preparation were discarded. The inclusion body pellets were washed two times with<br>
wash buSert0.02M Tris-HCl pH 8.5,0.5 mM EDTA) then washed two times with the same<br>
buffer containing Triton X-l 00(2%, v/v) followed by two additional buffer washes without<br>
detergent. Both pellets were solubilized using 6M guanidine hydrochioride, 0.1M Tris pH<br>
8.5,0.1M DTT, and 1 mM EDTA. To aid in the solubilizaiion proxsess, each pellet was<br>
subjected to homogenisation using apolytron homogenizer followed by overnight stirring at<br>
room temperature. The solubilized proteins were clarified by centrifugation prior to<br>
denaturing chromatography through Superdex 200 (5.5 liter column-equilibrated with 0.05M<br>
£lycine/H3P04 pH 3.0 with 2M Guanidine-HCl) at 20 ml per minute.<br>
Denatured neublastin was identified by SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing either wild<br>
type-neublastint&gt;r N95KL were pooled and concentrated to approximately 250 mL using an<br>
Amicon 2.5-liter stirred cell •concentrator. After filtration to remove any precipitate, the<br>
concentrated protein was subjected to renaturing sizing chromatography through Superdex<br>
200 equilibrated with 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 7.8,0.5M guanidine-HCl, O mM reduced<br>
glutathione and 0.22 mM oxidized glutathione. The column was developed using 0.5M<br>
guanidine-HCl at 20 mL per minute. Fractions containing renatured wild-type neublastin or<br>
N95K neublastin were identified by SDS-PAGE, pooled, and stored at 4°C until needed for<br>
His tag removal.<br>
Alternative Method of Refolding Wild-type Neublastin and Mutated N95K<br>
Neublastin by Dilution.<br>
To refold neublastin by dilution, solubilzed protein was rapidly diluted in refolding<br>
buffer (0.5 M guanidine-HCl, 0.35 M L-Arginine, 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.8), 0.2<br>
mM glutathione reduced, 1 mM glutathione oxidized, and 0.1% Tween-BO) at a final<br>
concentration of 0.1 rag/ml and incubated at room temperature for 48 hours without stirring.<br>
Refolded neublastin was then concentrated 25 fold, brought to 40 mM imidazole, and applied<br>
to a chromatography column containing Ni-NTA agarose to further concentrate the product<br>
and eliminate host cell proteins. The column was washed with 10 times column volume with<br>
wash buffer (40 mM imidazole, 0.5 M guanidine-HCl). Neubiastin was then eluted from the<br>
resin with 0.2 M Imidazole and 0.5 M guanidine-HCl.<br>
Concentration of Column-Refolded Neublastin by Ni-NTA Chromatography.<br>
Column-renatured neublastin was stored at 4°C for at least 24 hours before<br>
proceeding with the purification to promote disulfide formation between the neublastin<br>
monomers. During this time, a precipitate formed and was removed by filtration through a<br>
0.2 n polyether sulfone (PES) filter unit. To decrease non-specific binding, the protein<br>
solution was brought to 20 mM imidazole prior to loading on a 100 ml Ni-NTA tQiagen)<br>
column equilibrated with column buffer (0.5 M guanidine and 20 mM imMazoIfi) at 50 ml per<br>
minute. Following the protein application, the column was washed to baseline using 4he<br>
same buffer. Neublastin was eluted from the resin using approximately 300 mL of elution<br>
buffer containing 0.5 M guanidine-HCl and 0.4 M imidazole. After elution, neublastin was<br>
dialyzed overnight (using 10 kDa dialysis tubing) at room temperature against ten volumes of<br>
5 mM HC1. Dialysis promotes the hydrolysis of contaminating substances andxtecr-eases the<br>
guanidine-HCl and imidazole concentrations to 0.05M and 0.04M, respectively.<br>
Cleavage of the His Tag by Lysyl Endopeptidase or Enterokinase,<br>
The next day, any precipitate that formed during dialysis was removed by filiation.<br>
The following purification steps apply •to both the column- and dilution-refolded neublastin<br>
products. The protein sample was made to 0.1 M NaCl by the addition of NaCl from a 5M<br>
stock for a final salt concentration including the remaining guanidine-HCI of approximately<br>
150mM. This concentration was confirmed using a conductivity meter. Additionally, 1M<br>
HEPES pH 7.8 was added for a final concentration of 25mM. To cleave the His -tag, lysyl<br>
endopeptidase was added to the wild-type neuhlastin and enterokinase was added to the<br>
N9SK mutated neublastin, bom at an approximately 1:300 ratio of protease to neublastin.<br>
Enterokinase was used in place of lysyl endopeptidase for the N95K mutated neublastin due<br>
to an additional protease cleavage site in the mutated protein at Lys95. The samples were<br>
stirred at room temperature for 2 hours and the digestions monitored by SDS-PAGE.<br>
His Tag Removal by Ni-NTA Chromatography.<br>
Protease-treated neublastin was applied to a 100 mL Ni-NTA column-equilibrated<br>
with 0.5M guanidine-HCI and 20 mM imidazole at 50 mL per minute. The column was<br>
washed to baseline with the same buffer. Any protein washing off the column was pooled<br>
with the flow-through protein containing neublastin without the His tag.<br>
CM Silica Chromatography.<br>
Following Ni-NTA Chromatography, the protein was immediately subjected to further<br>
purification through CM silica resin. A 20 mL CM silica column equilibrated with loading<br>
buffer (5 mM phosphate pH 6.5,150 mM NaCl) was loaded with neublastin at 20 mL per<br>
minute. The column was washed with twenty column volumes of wash buffer (5 mM<br>
phosphate pH 6.5,400 mM NaCl) and the protein step eluted with elution buffer containing 5<br>
mM phosphate pH 6.5 but with 1 M NaCl. The eluted protein was dialyzed overnight against<br>
the phosphate alone to bring the salt concentration down to 100 mM for N95K and 150 mM<br>
for wild type neublastin. Both samples were filtered through a 0.2 |i PES filter unit, analyzed<br>
by SDS-PAGE, and stored at 4°C until needed for further characterizations and/or<br>
PEGylation.<br>
Wild-type and N95K mutated neublastin protein preparations were subjected to UV<br>
spectrum anatysis to assess their absorbance at 280. Using a micro quarts cuvette and<br>
blanking against buffer alone, 100 \il of either wild-type or N95K mutated neublastin was<br>
continuously scanned from 230 to 330 nm using a Beckmanspectrophotometer. Based on<br>
this analysis, wild-type neublastin was determined to be at a concentration of 1.1 rag/ml and<br>
N95K mutated neublastin at 2.6 mg/ml (A2SO nmE°'1%=0.5 used for-each protein). Less<br>
than 1% precipitated material was identified based on absortiance at 330 ran.<br>
To assess the purity of both protein preparations, each •sample -(0.5 mg) was-subjected<br>
to size exclusion chromatography through a 16/30*Superdex 75 column. The column was<br>
equilibrated with 5mM phosphate pH 6.5 containing 400 mM NaCl and developed with a 1.5<br>
mL per minute flow rate. Based on the absorbance at 280 nm, both wild-type and N95K<br>
mutated neublastin preparations migrated as a single peak with an expected molecular weight<br>
(23-24 kDa), and they did not contain any significant protein contamination.<br>
Both wild-type and N95K mutated neublastin proteins were reduced in 2.5 M<br>
guanidine-HCl, 60 mM Tris pH 8.0 and 16 mM DTT. The reduced samples were desalted<br>
over a short C4 column and analyzed on-line by ESMS using a triple quadrupole instrument.<br>
The ESMS raw data were deconvolved by the MaxEnt program to generate mass spectra.<br>
This procedure allows multiple charged signals to collapse into one peak that directly<br>
corresponds to the molecular mass inkilodaltons (kDa). The4econvoluted mass spectrum<br>
for wild-type showed the predominant species is 12046 Da, which is in agreement with the<br>
predicted molecular weight of 12046.7 Da for the 113 amino acid form of the protein. A<br>
minor component was also observed (12063 Da) suggesting the presence of an oxidation<br>
product. Three peaks were identified in the N95K mutated neublastin protein sample. The<br>
major component demonstrated an apparent molecular mass of 11345 Da in agreement with<br>
the predicted mass for the 106 amino acid form of the protein. The other two peaks had<br>
masses of 11362 and 12061 Da, suggesting N95K oxidation and the presence of the 113<br>
amino acid form, respectively.<br>
The presence of the 106 and 113 amino acid forms in the N95K mutated neublastin<br>
protein preparation is attributable to digestion with enterokinase. This protease from<br>
Biozyme is a natural enzyme preparation purified from calf intestinal mucosa and is imported<br>
to contain a slight trypsin contamination (0.25 ng trypsin per jig enterokinase). Therefore,<br>
trypsin may be acting on the N95K. mutated neublastin protein on the carboxy terminal side<br>
of Arg7 to produce the predominant 106 amino acid form. On the other hand, lysyl<br>
endopeptidase used to cleave wild-type neublastin is a single protease activity acting on 4he<br>
carboxy terminal side of the lysine residue contained within the His .tag to produce the mature<br>
113 amino acid neublastin form. Both the 106 and 113 amino acid forms of neublastin are<br>
equally active in all assays tested and behave similarly in guanidine-HCl stability tests.<br>
Neublastin activity was determined by its ability to stimulate c-Ret phosphorylation in<br>
NB41A3-mRL3 cells using the KfilA ELfSA described in Example 3. Phosphoryiated Ret<br>
was detected by incubating (2 hours) the captured receptor with HRP-conjugated<br>
phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10; 0.2 ^g per well). Following the incubation, the wells were<br>
washed six times with TBST, and the HRP activity detected at 450 nm with a eolorimetric<br>
assay. The absorbance values from wells treated with lysate or with lysis buffer alone were<br>
measured, background corrected, and the data plotted as a function of the concentration of<br>
neublastin present in the activation mixture. The data demonstrate that the purified<br>
neublastin polypeptides resulted in the appearance of phosphorylated RET, indicating that the<br>
purified neublastin was active in this assay.<br>
Example 6: Preparation of a Serum Albumin-Neublastin Conjugate<br>
Wild-type rat neublastin at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in PBS was treated with 1 mM<br>
sulfo-SMCC (Pierce) and desalted to remove excess cross-linker. Since the wild-type<br>
neublastin protein contains only a single amihe at its ammo-terminus and no free suUhydryl<br>
groups, reaction with SMCC was expected to result in site-specific modification of the<br>
neublastin with SMCC attached at its amino-terminus.<br>
Next, 60 fj,g of the neublastin-SMCC conjugate was incubated with 120 jig of bovine<br>
serum albumin and analyzed for extent of cross-linking by SDS-PAGE. BSA contains a<br>
single free SH group and consequently reaction with the neublastin-SMCC conjugate is<br>
expected to result in modification at this site through the maleimide on the SMCC. Under<br>
these conditions, two additional bands of higher molecular weight were observed, which are<br>
consistent in mass with modification of the neublastin with a single BSA moiety and with<br>
two BSA molecules since each neublastin molecule contains two amino-termini that can<br>
undergo reaction, and consequently are in agreement with this notion. Concurrent with the<br>
formation of these bands, was a decrease in the intensity of the neublastin-SMCC and BSA<br>
bands. Based on the intensity of the remaining neublastin band, the reaction appeared to have<br>
gone to 70-80% completion.<br>
The monosubstituted product was purified from the reaction mixture by subjecting the<br>
material to cation exchange chromatography and size exclusion chromatography on a<br>
Superdex 200 column .(Pharmacia) essentially as described for PEGj'lation studies discussed<br>
above. Column fractions from the gel filtration run were ana^fzed by SDS-PAGE and those<br>
t<br>
containing the monosubstituted product were analyzed for protein content by absorbance at<br>
280 nm. Since the mass of BSA is approximately twice that of neublastin, the apparent<br>
concentration was divided by a factor of 3 to give the neublastin equivalent. This fraction<br>
was subjected this to analysis for fuactixm in the K1RA ELISA. IC50 values for both the wtand<br>
BSA-conjugated neublastin were 3-6 nM, indicating that conjugation to the BSA had not<br>
compromised function.<br>
While these preliminary studies were generated with BSA, the corresponding serum<br>
albumin proteins from rats and humans also contain a free SH. Consequently a similar<br>
approach can be applied to generate a rat serum albumin-rat neublastin conjugate for<br>
performing PK and efficacy studies in rats and human serum albumin-human neublastin for<br>
performing clinical trials. Similarly SMCC can be substituted with any of a number of crosslinkers<br>
that contain an ammo reactive group on one side and a thiol reactive group on the<br>
other side. Examples of amine reactive •cross-linkers that insert a thiol reactive-maleimide are<br>
AMAS, BMPS, MBS, EMCS, SMPB, SMPH, KMUS, or GMBS, that insert a thiol reactivehaloacetate<br>
group are SBAP, SIA, SIAB and that provide a protected or non protected thiol<br>
for reaction with sulfhydryl groups to product a reducible linkage are SPDP, SMPT, S ATA,<br>
or SATP all of which are available from Pierce. Such cross linkers are merely exemplary and<br>
many alternative strategies are anticipated for linking the amino-terminus of neublastin with<br>
serum albumin. A skilled artisan also could generate conjugates to serum albumin that are<br>
not targeted at the amino-terminus of neublastin or at the thiol moiety on serum albumin.<br>
Neublastm-serum albumin fusions created using genetic engineering where neublastin is<br>
fused to the serum albumin gene at its amino-terminus, carboxy-terminus, or at both ends, are<br>
also expected to be functional.<br>
This method can be extended through routine adaptations to any neublastin-serum<br>
albumin conjugate that would result in a product with a prolonged half-life in animals and<br>
consequently in humans.<br>
Example 7: Crystallization and Structure Determination of Human Neublastin<br>
Selenomethionine labeled neublastin was expressed using a standard procedure to<br>
inhibit methionine biosynthesis (Van Duyne, et al., 1991, Science 252, 839-842). Both<br>
wildtype neublastin and selenomethionine-incorporated neublastin wastjoncentrated to 17<br>
nig/ml in 0.8 M arginine. The protein stock was concentrated to 17 mg/ml in 0.8 M arginine.<br>
Crystals were grown by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method (Jancarik, J. •&amp; -Kirn, S.H.<br>
,1991, J. Appl. Crystdlogr. 24,409-411) out of 1.25 M magnesium sulfate, 0.1 M MES <br>
6.5 at 20°C. The most reproducible crystals were obtained by microseeding. The crystals<br>
were cryoprotected by the addition of 5% ethylene glycol every 60 seconds to a-final<br>
concentration of 1.25 M magnesium sulfate, 0.1 M MES pH 6.5, and 30% {v/v) ethylene<br>
glycol and then frozen by quick transfer into liquid nitrogen.<br>
Crystals approximately 100 microns on each side diffracted to 1.6A at beamline X4A<br>
at the National Synchrotron Light Source (Upton, NY). Data processing with the HKL<br>
program package (Otwinowski (1993) &amp; Proceeding of thetlOM Study Weekend: Data<br>
63<br>
Collection and Processing {Sawer et al., Eds.) pp. 56-62, Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington)<br>
revealed the-crystals to belong to a C2 space group with 1 covalent dimer per asymmetric unit<br>
and approximate-cell dimensions a=l 15 A, b=33 A , c=55 A and cc= y =90°,*J3=99°.<br>
The crystal structure was solved by multiple isomorphous replacements. Native<br>
neublastin crystals were soaked in 1 mM PtCLj for 4 hours, 10 mM IrCla for 72 hours, and 10<br>
mM IrClg for 18 hours and data collected and processed by the HKL suite (Otwinowski et al.,<br>
supra). The two selenomethionine sites were located by inspection of isomorphous and<br>
anomalous difference pattersons. The remaining sites were located using SOLVE {4). The<br>
phases were improved by RESOLVE (Terwilliger et al., 1999,. Ada Ciystallogr. D. 55, 849-<br>
861) to a figure of merit of 0.56 and resulting maps were of sufficient quality to trace the<br>
neublastin model. Alternating cycles of model building with O2D (5 G J Kleywegt &amp; T A<br>
Jones, "O2D - the manual", software manual, Uppsala, 1994) and refinement with CNX using<br>
a mlhl target and refined against the selenomethionine data resulted in a complete model of<br>
the neublastin protein, excluding the first amino-tenninal 13 amino acids, as well as 89 water<br>
molecules and 6 sulfate anions. The final R^e is 28.5% and R-factor is 24.7% to 2.0A with<br>
good stereochemistry.<br>
Example S: Sulfate Binding Sites and Modeling of Heparin Sulfate<br>
A cluster of three sulfates at the vertices of an approximate equilateral triangle are<br>
located on at the pre-helix region of the neublastin surface and could represent a binding site<br>
for heparin sulfate. There are three arginine residues that appear to have key interactions<br>
with these sulfates. The arginine residue R48 links together all three sulfates (#2, #6, and<br>
#3). Its backbone amide interacts with sulfate #2, while its side chain guanidinium group<br>
forms a bifurcated hydrogen bond with sulfates #6 and #3. A second arginine residue (R49)<br>
forms a hydrogen bond with sujfate #2 and a third arginine residue (RSI) forms a long<br>
hydrogen bond to sulfate #6.<br>
These sulfates may represent binding pockets for heparin sulfate, which if mutated to<br>
non-positively charged residues could reduce heparin sulfate binding and possibly decrease<br>
and/or delay clearance of the neublastin molecule upon in vivo administration. A model of<br>
heparin sulfate bound to neublastin may be constructed by superimposing the sulfates of the<br>
glycosaminoglycan with the existing sulfates of the neublastin crystal structure. The n and<br>
n+2 saccharide-linked sulfates in heparin sulfate from the crystal structure ofFGF-1<br>
complexed to heparin sulfate are separated by approximately 8.5A (Pellegrini et al.,
Nature 407,1029-1034). This measurement closely matches &amp;e distance between sulfates of<br>
3-Sulfate cluster in the neublastin structure; sulfates #3 and #6 are separated by 8.3 A and<br>
sulfates #3 and #2 are separated by $. 1 A. This distance measurement correspondence could<br>
indicate that this R48/R49/R51 motif is part of a heparin binding site. This suggests that<br>
single site mutations of R48, R49 or R51 to -glutamate or aspartate, or any other non-positive<br>
amino acid, might reduce heparin sulfate binding affinity without reducing the receptorbinding<br>
activity-of neublastin, thereby resulting in a biologically active product that has a<br>
prolonged half-life in animals and consequently hi humans. To test this possibility, we are<br>
generating a series of iconstructs that contain one or more arginines mutated to glutamic acids.<br>
The mutated neublastin products will be expressed in E. coli, purified and refolded, and<br>
tested for function. Finally, the products will be tested for ability to bind heparin and for<br>
pharmacokmetics and pharmacodynamics hi animals.<br>
One or more of these sites might also provide other sites for PEGylation which can be<br>
accomplished by replacing R with K orC and applying the methods described above.<br>
Example 9: Dosage of Begylated Mutated Neublastin NBN106-N95K on<br>
Reversal of Tactile and Thermal Hyperalgesia in Nerve Ligation Animal Model of<br>
Neuropathic Pain<br>
We had previously demonstrated that 1 mg/kg wild-type neubiastin, administered s.c.<br>
3 times per week, results hi nearly complete reversal and normalization of neuropathic pain<br>
behaviors (tactile allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia) induced by spinal nerve ligation hi the<br>
rat, whereas 0.03 mg/kg wild-type neublastin, administered s.c. 3 times per week had no<br>
effect and 0.1 mg/kg and 0.6 mg/kg wild-type neublastin, administered s.c. 3 times per week<br>
had intermediate effects in this model.<br>
Here, we describe studies to address the reversal effect of pegylated N95K neublastin<br>
on tactile allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in theChung L5/L6 spinal nerve ligation<br>
("SNL") model. Sprague-Dawley male rats (230 - SSOg) were divided into two groups. All<br>
rats received the spinal nerve ligation. One group of rats (n=6) was administered vehicle by<br>
subcutaneous injection. A second group of rats (n=6 per group) wer-e administered pegylated<br>
N95K. neublastin (3 ,(4) X 10 M)a PEG NEN106-N95K) by subcutaneous injection at 10<br>
fig/kg. 3(,4) X 10 kDa PEG NBN106-N95K, comprised neublastin protein mat was E. coliderived<br>
and contained an Asn-to-Lys amino acid substitution at position 95, then truncated<br>
{amino-termhius truncation of 7 amino acids; NBN106), and-finally pegylated with an<br>
average of 3.3 PEG moieties per dimer of NBN, using methoxylpoly(ethylene glycol)-<br>
succinimidyl propionate (SPA-PEG) with a molecular massif 10,000 Da as theieactant. The<br>
vehicle consisted of 5 mM phosphate and 150 mM sodium chloride at pH-6.5. Subcutaneous<br>
injections were administered on days 3,5, 7, 10,12 and 14 following the operation (post-<br>
SNL). The Von Frey (Chaplan et al. (1994), J. Neurosci. Meth. 53:55-63) and Hargreave's (Hargreaves et al. (1988), Pain.32: 77-88) behavioral tests were used to monitor tactile and thermal responses, respectively. These pain responses were monitored prior to the spinal nerve ligation to establish baseline responses, on day 2 post-SNL to verify the presence of tactile and thermal hyperalgesia, and then on days 3,5,7,10,12,14 and 15 post-SNL. To assess statistical significance of drug treatment relative to vehicle treatment, a 1-way analysis of variance (1-way ANOVA) was carried out followed by a post-hoc "Student Neuman KeuIs (SNK) test.<br>
Both types of neuropathic pain behavior (tactile allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia developed folly by day 2 post-SNL, as expected. Subcutaneous administration of 10 µg/kg 3(,4) X 10 kDa PEG N95K-NBN106 led to substantial and statistically significant reversal of both types of neuropathic pain in rats with spinal nerve ligation. In rats with spinal nerve ligation, the effect of 10 µg/kg 3(,4) X 10 kDa PEG NBN106-N95K on thermal sensitivity and tactile allodynia first became statistically significant 4 days after the initiation of administration of pegylated N95K neublastin. The effect of 10 µg/kg 3(,4) X 10 kDa PEG NBN106-N95K on thermal sensitivity and tactile allodynia reached a plateau approximately 4 days after the initiation of administration of pegylated N95K neublastin. The effects of 3(,4) X 10 kDa PEG NBN106-N95K did not diminish during the 2 to 3 day interval between administrations. In fact, there was substantial normalization of pain behaviors between the administrations of pegylated N95K neublastin on days 5 and 7. In another experiment (data not shown), subcutaneous administration of 3µg/kg 3C4) X 10 kDa PEG NBN106-N95K on days 3, J, 7, 10, 12 and 14 led to a significant normalization of pain behaviors (tactile and thermal hyperalgesia) in the SNL model, though the onset of the effect was somewhat slower.<br>
These results demonstrated that^of 3(,4) X 10 kDa PEG NBN1D6-N95K has an increased potency of at least 100 to 333-fold over non-mutated non-glycosylafed neublastin on tactile allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia pain behaviors in the SNL model. The enhanced pharmacokinetic properties of 3(,4) X 10 kDa PEG N95K NBN106 compared to non-mutated non-glycosylated neublastin indicated that efficacy of systemically adrninretered neublastin correlates with serum levels of neublastin. These results demonstrated that polymer conjugates of mutated neublastin can be used to treat neuropathic pain in patients with greatly<br><br>
reduced doses, and potentially reduced dosing frequency, due to their-enhanced<br>
bioavailability compared to unconjugated neublastin.<br>

Although particular embodiments have been disclosed herein in detail, this has been<br>
