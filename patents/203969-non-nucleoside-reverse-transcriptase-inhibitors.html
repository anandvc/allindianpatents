COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"NON-NUCLEOSIDE REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE INHIBITORS"<br>
BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM   [CANADA]   LTD.,   of 2100   Cunard  Street, Laval, Quebec H7S 2G5, Canada,<br>
The   following   specification   particularly   describes   the   nature   of  the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br><br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to novel compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, their use, either alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents, in the treatment or prophylaxis of HIV infection, and to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The disease known as acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), particularly the strain known as HIV-1. In order for HIV to be replicated by a host cell, the information of the viral genome must be integrated into the host cell"s DNA. However, HIV is a retrovirus, meaning that its genetic information is in the form of RNA. The HIV replication cycle therefore requires a step of transcription of the viral genome (RNA) into DNA, which is the reverse of the normal chain of events. The transcription of the viral RNA into DNA is accomplished by an enzyme that has been aptly dubbed reverse transcriptase (RT). The HIV virion includes a copy of RT along with the viral RNA.<br>
Reverse transcriptase has three known enzymatic functions; it acts as an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase, as a ribonuclease, and as a DNA-dependent DNA polymerase. Acting as an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase, RT transcribes a single-stranded DNA copy of the viral RNA. Acting as a ribonuclease, RT destroys the original viral RNA, and frees the DNA just produced from the original RNA. Finally, acting as a DNA-dependent DNA polymerase, RT makes a second, complementary DNA strand, using the first DNA strand as a template. The two strands form<br>
2<br><br>
double-stranded DNA, which is integrated into the host cell"s genome by another enzyme called integrase.<br>
Compounds that inhibit the enzymatic functions of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase will inhibit replication of HIV-1 in infected cells. Such compounds are useful in the prevention or treatment of HIV-1 infection in human subjects, as demonstrated by known RT inhibitors such as 3"-azido-3"-deoxythymidine (AZT), 21,31-dideoxyinosine (dd1), 2l,31-dideoxycytidine (ddC), d4T, 3TC Nevirapine, Delavirdine, Efavirenz and Abacavir, the main drugs thus far approved for use in the treatment of AIDS.<br>
As with any antiviral therapy, use of RT inhibitors in the treatment of AIDS eventually leads to a virus that is less sensitive to the given drug. Resistance (reduced sensitivity) to these drugs is the result of mutations that occur in the reverse transcriptase segment of the pol gene. Several mutant strains of HIV have been characterised, and resistance to known therapeutic agents is due to mutations in the RT gene. Some of the most commonly observed mutants clinically are: the Y181C mutant, in which a tyrosine (Y), at codon 181, has been mutated to a cysteine (C) residue, and K103N where the lysine (K) at position 103 has been replaced by asparagine (N). Other mutants which emerge with increasing frequency during treatment with known antivirals include the single mutants V106A, G190A, Y188C, and P236L; and the double mutants K103N/Y181G, K103N/P225H, K103N/V108I, and K103N/L100I.<br>
As therapy and prevention of HIV infection using antivirals continues, the emergence of new resistant strains is expected to increase. There is therefore an ongoing need for new inhibitors of RT, with different patterns of effectiveness against the various mutants.<br>
Compounds having tricyclic structures which are inhibitors of HIV-1 are<br>
3<br><br>
described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,366,972. Other inhibitors of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase are described in Hargrave et al., J. Med Chem., 34, 2231 (1991).<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,705,499 proposes 8-arylalkyl- and 8-arylheteroalkyl-5,ll-dihydro-6H-dipyrido[3-2-B:2.3-E][1,4]diazepines as inhibitors of RT. The exemplified compounds are shown to have some activity against wild type and mutant HIV-1 RT, particularlyYl 81C and other single mutants such as K103N albeit less effectively.<br>
Specifically, the compounds of the present invention are effective at inhibiting the Y181C and K103N mutants as well as a broad range of other single mutants and certain commonly found double mutants such as K103N/Y181C and K103N/P225H.<br>

REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE (RT) ASSAYS<br>
ASSAY THEORY:<br>
Among the enzymes for which Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1) encodes is a reverse transcriptase (1), so-named because it transcribes a DNA copy from an RNA template. This activity can be quantitatively measured in a cell-free enzyme assay and is based upon the observation that reverse transcriptase is able to use a synthetic template poly r(C) primed with a biotinylated oligo d(G) to transcribe a radio-labelled DNA strand utilising 3H-dGTP as a substrate. The assay described below utilises the wild-type enzyme (which is the predominant form of the enzyme observed in patients infected with HIV-1) and can also be used with mutant RT enzymes (for example, Y181C, prepared by site-directed mutagenesis in which the tyrosine residue at codon 181 has been replaced by a cysteine residue) in analogous assay conditions. This assay allows compounds to be evaluated for their effectiveness at inhibiting the mutant enzymes.<br>
MATERIALS:<br>
a) Preparation of the enzyme<br>
Some HIV-1 IIIB clone BH10 RT mutants were provided by Dr. C.-K. Shih (Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals Inc., U.S.A.) in the vector pKK233-2 (Pharmacia). Briefly an HIV RT clone pKRT2 containing only the RT p66 gene regulated by the lac operon/ trc promoter was obtained from Dr. W. Summers (Yale University) (2). A variety of specific amino acid substitutions were introduced into the wild-type RT gene by site-directed mutagenesis. RT clones were subcloned into the pKK233-2 bacterial expression vector. Clones provided included wild-type, Vall06Ala, Tyrl81Cys, Tyrl88Cys,<br><br><br>
Tyrl88Leu, Glyl90Ala and Pro236Leu. Others were made in-house by site-directed mutagenesis of the pKK233-2 RT clones including Lysl03Asn, Lysl03Asn/Tyrl81Cys, Lysl03Asn/Leul00Ile, Lysl03Asn/Pro225His/ and Lysl03Asn/Vall08Ile.<br>
b) Purification of Enzyme<br>
Purification of recombinant reverse transcriptase was performed using a combination of methods previously described (3). A single colony from a fresh plate of transformed JM109 cells was used to initiate growth of a pre-culture grown o/n at 37°C. Two liters of growth medium were inoculated with this pre-culture. At ODeoo -1.5 (5-6 h at 37°C), RT gene expression was induced with IPTG (1 mM final), and the fermentation was continued for a few more hours at 37 °C. After centrifugation, supernatants were discarded while cell pellets were pooled and stored at -80 °C until purification. Cells were thawed at 4 °C overnight and suspended in lysis buffer (MES 50mM pH 6, EDTA ImM, 10% v/v glycerol, 0.02% w/v n-octyl-B-D-glucoside, 0.02% w/v sodium azide). Lysozyme was added and the mixture was incubated on ice for 40 minutes. After homogenization using a Dounce in presence of lysozyme and sonication, the cells were centrifuged for 30 minutes. Supernatant (S1) was saved and stored at 4°C. The centrifuged pellet was resuspended in extraction buffer (MES 50mM pH 6, KPO4 50 mM pH 6, KC1 lOOmM, 10% v/v glycerol, 0.02% w/v n-octyl-p-D-glucoside, 0.02% w/v sodium azide) and stirred for 30 minutes at 4°C. This second mixture was centrifuged again and the supernatant (S2) was saved. The above procedure was repeated 2 more times saving supernatants S3 and S4 and one last extraction was performed overnight (S5); Polymin P (0.005% final) was added to the combined supernatants to .remove nucleic acids. This solution was stirred for 75 minutes at 4 °C and centrifuged for 1 h. The<br>
57<br><br>
supernatant (SS1) was precipitated on ice with 20% w/v ammonium sulfate and stirred for 1 h at 4 °C. The mixture was then centrifuged and the resulting supernatant (SS2) was precipitated with additional 40% w/v ammonium sulfate (60% total), stirred for 1 h and centrifuged again. The final pellet (P1) was stored overnight at 4 °C before undergoing purification the following day. All steps of the purification were performed at 4 °C unless otherwise stated.<br>
Pellet (P1) was resuspended into MES 50mM pH 6, KP0410 mM pH 6, KCl lOOmM, 10% v/v glycerol, 0.02% w/v n-octyl-p-D-glucoside, 0.02% w/v sodium azide. The suspension was dialysed against the same buffer overnight using 12-14kD MWCO dialysis tubing. The dialysate was centrifuged and the supernatant was filtered through Millex-PF 0.8 pi filter units. The filtered sample was loaded on a Hydroxy Apatite column (30-mL bed volume) and washed with the same buffer. The bound enzyme was eluted with -220 mL of a linear gradient of 10 to 300mM KPO4 in the above buffer. The fractions containing p66/p51 heterodimer (as determined by SDS-PAGE 8% and Western blotting) were pooled for the next column. The RT containing fractions were diluted two-fold with Bis-Tris propane 50 mM pH 7.0, (NH4)2S041 M, 0.02% w/v OBG, 10% v/v glycerol, 0.02% w/v NaN3 and loaded on a Hi-Trap Heparin Sepharose column (5-mL bed volume) and washed with the same buffer. The bound RT was then eluted with 75 mL of a linear gradient of 0 to 1 M ammonium sulfate in the same buffer. RT-containing fractions were pooled according to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analyses. Protein concentration of this pool was determined by the Bradford method using BSA as standard. The final enzyme preparation was dialyzed in MES 50mM pH 6, KPO4 300 mM pH 6, KCl 175mM, 10% v/v glycerol, 0.02% w/v sodium azide andaliquoted and frozen at -80° C.<br><br><br>
ASSAY PROCEDURE:<br>
The radiometric enzyme assay has been adapted to a 96-well microtiter plate format and uses streptavidin scintillation proximity beads. The assay is briefly described below. The HIV-1 RT enzyme was thawed and appropriately diluted into Tris/HCl 50 mM pH 7.8 containing NaC1 60mM, MgCl2 hexahydrate 2mM, DTT 6mM, reduced glutathione 2mM and 0.02% w/v Chaps to give =3 nM enzyme.   To 30 uL of this enzyme solution was added 10 uL of inhibitor solution (50 uM to 2.5 nM inhibitor in same assay buffer as above containing 15% v/v DMSO). The plate was pre-incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature before proceeding to the next step. In this pre-incubation step, the highest and lowest inhibitor concentrations were 12.5 uM and 0.62 nM respectively and the concentration of DMSO was 3.75% v/v. Then the enzymatic reaction was initiated by addition of 10 uL of substrates solution. The final reaction mixture contained Tris/HCl 50 mM pH 7.8, NaCI 60 mM, MgCl2 6H20 2 mM, DTT 6 mM, GSH 2 mM, Chaps 0.02% w/v DMSO 3% v/v, Poly rC 179 nM, Biotin dGis 18 nM, dGTP 288 nM, and 3H-dGTP 71nM.<br>
In this incubation step, the highest and lowest inhibitor concentrations were 10 uM and 0.5 nM respectively. After addition of substrates, the plate was covered with a plastic seal and incubated for 1 hour at 37°C in a dry incubator. Then the reaction was quenched by addition of 75 uL of EDTA 0.5M containing 5mg/mL of streptavidin scintillation proximity beads.<br>
The plate was shaken for 2 minutes at medium speed and incubated 1 hour   at room temperature.  Then 75 ul of cesium chloride 7 M solution was added, the plate was shaken for 2 minutes at medium speed and incubated again for 1 hour at room temperature. The plate was then covered with a plastic seal<br><br>
and counted using the TopCount-NXT™ Microplate Scintillation &amp; Luminescence Counter, Packard. Each well was counted for 60 seconds. Each row contained at its extremities a blank and a control well.<br>
The calculation for percent inhibition is as follows:<br><br>
Using the above assay, compounds of the invention were tested for inhibition of RT wild-type (WT) and mutant enzymes. The results are listed in Table 2, as IC50 (nM).<br>
To confirm the ability of these compounds to inhibit HIV replication, they were also tested in the human T-Cell Culture (Syncytia) Assay described below.<br>
ELISA assay for assessment of activity in cell culture<br>
Compounds of the invention were tested for their ability to inhibit HIV replication in cell culture in a 96 well plate assay. Complete RPMI 1640, consisting of RPMI 1640 + 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 M-g/ml gentamycin and 10 uM (3-mercaptoethanol was used for dilution of the compound as well as cell growth medium. The T lymphocyte cell line C8166 was infected at a multiplicity of infection of 0.001 with viruses coding for wild type and mutant reverse transcriptase. Cells were then incubated for three days in the presence of serial dilutions of the compounds of the invention. The supernatant was pooled from eight replica wells and the concentration of extracellular p24 was determined using a commercially available HIV-1 p24 antigen assay kit (Beckman-Coulter®). The level of inhibition (% inhibition)<br>
60<br><br><br>
The results are listed in Table 3, as EC50 (nM). Specificity Assays<br>
In order to assess the specificity of the enzyme inhibitory activity of the compounds provided by the invention, a few were tested, for their ability to inhibit other viral polymerases (such as Hepatitis C virus and Respiratory Syncytial virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerases) as well as mammalian polymerases (such as Calf Thymus RNA-dependent DNA polymerase and Human telomerase) using known assay methods. None of the compounds so tested was observed to possess any significant inhibitory activity against these enzymes. These results indicate that the enzyme inhibitory activity of the compounds provided by the invention is directed rather specifically against HIV-1 RT.<br>
