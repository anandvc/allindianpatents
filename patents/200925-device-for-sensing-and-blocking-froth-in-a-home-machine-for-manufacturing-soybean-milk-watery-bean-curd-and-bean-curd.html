				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a device for sensing and blocking froth in a home machine for manufacturing soybean milk, watery bean curd, and bean curd, and more particularly to a device for sensing and blocking froth in a home machine for manufacturing soybean milk, watery bean curd, and bean curd, which allows a heater not to be operated only when the home manufacturing machine contains froth, so as to remove froth, thereby preventing the machine from getting damaged.<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
A conventional method for domestic use which manufactures soybean milks, watery bean curds, and bean curds will be described herein below.<br>
First, the soybeans are washed clean. The washed beans are then soaked and made swollen in the water for several hours to be easily pulverized. The swollen beans are pulverized by using a millstone or a mixer, so that raw bean juice is produced. The raw bean juice is divided into bean-curd refuse and protein juice using a fine sieve gin or cloth.  The divided<br>
1A<br><br>
protein juice is put in a kettle or a receptacle and boiled. At this time,  since froth inevitably forms and causes the kettle or receptacle to overflow, the protein juice is boiled while repeatedly and artificially adjusting thermal power with care so that the froth does not overflow.  After boiling the protein juice enough, an addition such as sugar or salt is put in the boiled protein juice to manufacture potable soybean milk.    Also,  after  boiling  the  protein  juice  enough,  a predetermined amount  of  coagulating agent  such as  calcium sulfate or the like is added to the boiled protein juice. After the coagulating agent-added protein juice is stirred, when several minutes elapse,  it becomes a watery bean curd. The watery bean curd is put in a forming device and compressed and formed to manufacture bean curd.<br>
However, in the conventional method for domestic use which manufactures soybean milks, watery bean curds, and bean curds, since several processes are separately performed, it is inconvenient. Since the manufacturing process is complicated and it takes a lot of time, the conventional method is inefficient. In particular, it takes a lot of time to make the beans swell. It is difficult to suitably adjust the amount of beans. The recovery rate of the protein juice is relatively low and it is difficult to manage a clean status.<br>
In order to solve such problems, apparatuses capable of simply and conveniently manufacturing soybean milks,  watery<br>
2<br><br>
bean curds, and bear, curds are proposed. Hereinafter, such conventional apparatus for domestic use which manufactures soybean milks, watery- bean curds, and bean curds will be described with reference to FIG, 1.<br>
The conventional apparatus includes a<br>
body, a driving mcbr, a short driving shaft, a long driving shaft, a knife edge, a heater and a temperature sensor. A cover is installed at a upper portion of the body. The body is opened and closed by the cover. The driving motor is installed at the cover of the body. When a power is applied to the driving motor, the driving motor provides a rotating power. The short driving shaft serves as a rotary shaft of the driving motor. The long driving shaft is detachably fitted to the shorter driving shaft. The knife edge is connected to an end portion of the long driving shaft. The heater heats contents included in the body. The temperature sensor senses a heating temperature of the contents included in the body.<br>
An operation of the conventional apparatus for domestic use which manufactures soybean milks, watery bean curds, and bean curds will now be explained.<br>
Then a user puts bears and water into the interior of the<br><br>
body and inputs a power to a controller (not shown) , the controller operates the driving motor. Then the driving motor controls the knife edge 10 pulverize the beans and water. The controller operates the heater and the temperature sensor to perform a series of processes, in which the beans and water are heated at a predetermined temperature, so that the soybean milks, watery bean curds, and bean curds are sequentially manufactured.<br>
However, in the conventional apparatus for domestic use which manufactures soybean milks, watery bean curds, and bean curds, if a user operates the conventional apparatus in a state in which the froth forms and overflow during manufacturing process, the contents included in the body are spoilt and the conventional apparatus gets damaged.<br>
The copending Indian patent application no. 4 3 0CAL2 0 02, discloses a " device " for sensing and signalling absence of water in a home machine for manufacturing soybean milk, watery bean curd, and bean curd<br>

When a user puts beans and water into the interior of the body 1 and inputs a power to a controller I.Cl, the controller I. Cl operates the driving motor 2. Then the driving motor 2 controls the knife edge 5 to pulverize the beans and water. The controller operates the heater 6 and the temperature sensor 7 to perform a series of processes, in which the beans and water are heated at a predetermined temperature, so that the soybean milks, watery bean curds, and bean curds are sequentially manufactured.<br>
When the heater 6 is operated during manufacturing process of soybean miIks, watery bean curds, and bean curds, the controller I.Cl judges whether or not froth is generated in the interior of the body 1 in response to a signal inputted from the signal electrode E2 through the resistor R28 and the switching transistor Q10.<br>
When the froth is present in the interior of the body 1, the ground electrode El and the signal electrode E2 are electrically connected to each other by means of the froth. Accordingly, a ground electric potential is applied to a base of the switching transistor Q10 to turn off the switching transistor Q10. When the froth is absent in the interior of the body 1, the ground electrode El and the signal electrode E2 are electrically disconnected from each other.  Accordingly, a<br>
8<br><br>
non-ground electric potential is applied to the base of the switching transistor QiO to turn on the switching transistor Q10.<br>
The around electrode El and the signal electrode E2 are used in connection to two selected components installed in the body, respectively.

When the froth is present between the ground electrode El and the signal electrode E2, the switching transistor QIO is turned off. Accordingly, the controller I.Cl drives the switching transistor Q4 connected to an output terminal of the controller I.Cl.  The switching transistor Q4 drives and does<br>
inot operate the heater relay coil Ra driving for the heaterE6 to remove the occurrence of the froth.<br>
As mentioned above, the present invention can provides an<br>
apparatus for sensing and blocking froth is present in a machine for manufacturing soybean milk, a watery bean curd, and a bean curd, which allows a heater not to be operated only when the home manufacturing machine contains froth, thereby preventing the machine from getting damaged. The present invention can be applied and used in an apparatus field which<br>
9<br><br>
