				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the improved process for synthesis of d isubstituted-pyridine-N-oxides. particularly to the synthesis of 3,4-disubstituted pyndine-N-oxides, more particularly to 3-a 1ky1-4-nitro-substituted pyndine-N-Dxides and to the products thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
There is increasing interest in the research leading to synthesis of non-linear optical materials. These non-linear optical materials find their wide applications in the second harmonic generation, frequency mixing, optical parametric oscillation etc. The organic materials have shown better non-linear effects far exceeding those of their inorganic counterparts. The organic crystals have shown still better non-linear effects among -the organic materials. The substituted pyridine-N-ox ide has shown such properties. Therefore, the need was observed to have process ifor synthesising the substituted pyridine-N-oxides, particularly<br>
the disubst ituted pyr'idine-N-oxides, more particularly 3-alkyl-4-nitro-»ubstituted pyridine-N-oxides. The known such disubstituted pyridine-N-oxides having nitro-group in para-position, that is in position-4, have been synthesised by nitrating the mono-substituted pyridine-N-oxide compounds. The nitration of such mono-substituted pyridine-N-oxides in known such methods of the prior art has been carried out by using commonly used fuming nitric acid as nitrating agent.<br>
The  major  disadvantage of such known process	of  the<br>
prior  art,  wherein the nitrating agent is fuming	acid  is<br>
that, the process by itself is cumbersome as known	in the<br>
prior art.<br>
The another drawback of such known process of prior art as stated above, is that, such process results in the reduction of the overall yield of the final product, more particularly in reduction of the percent yield of the final product which inturn results in the increase in the cost of production of the final product.<br>
The another drawback of known process of prior art where the nitrating agent is mixture pf potassium nitrate<br>
/<br>
and  concentrated sulphuric acide, is that,   the .potassium nitrate results in formation of potassium -ylphsfp, turn is less soluble in water, so remains as an impurity  in final product, necessitating its extraction with chloroform.<br>
Still another drawback of such known process of orior art as stated above, is that, the neutralisation of acidic solution is carried-out by potassium hydroxide and the final product thus resulted, contains large quantities of impurities. The low purity thus resulted, in-turn results<br>
in  the poor performance of the final product, that  is, of the non-linear optical material.<br>
Yet another disadvantage of known such process, comprising of potassium nitrate as part of nitrating agent and potassium hydroxide as neutralising agent, is that, the potassium salts results in formation of potassium sulphate, as described herein above, and formation of potassium sulphate during the synthesis definitely results in decrease in purity and yield of the final product.<br>
Further drawback of such known process of the prior art', as stated above, is that, the purity of the final product is inhanced by extrating the final product in<br>
x<br>
chloroform.  This extraction not	only results in	increase in<br>
number  of  reaction  steps, but	also  results	in  further<br>
reduction of overall yield, more	particularly of	the percent<br>
yield of the final product.                             '<br>
i<br>
In addition to above drawbacks, as described herein above, the extraction step consumes large volumes of solvent, that is, chloroform. Hence, results in further increase in cost of the process. Further the use of chloroform as solvent makes the process health hazardous.<br>
NEED OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, there is a need for the development of an improved process for the synthesis of the substituted pyridine-N-oxides, particularly for the synthesis of the disubstituted pyridine-N-oxides, more particularly for the synthesis of 3, 4-disubstituted pyridine-N-oxides, even more<br>
particularly for the synthesis of 3-alkyl-4-nitro-pyridine-N-oxides, which can overcome the drawbacks of the such known process of the prior art. <br>
