5         hydroxyethyl cetyldimonium phosphate (available commercially as LUVIQUAT mono CP ex BASF) .<br>
     Fatty Material<br>
10        Conditioner compositions of the invention comprise from 1 to 10% by weight of a fatty material.  The combined use of fatty materials and cationic surfactants in conditioning compositions is believed to be especially advantageous, because this leads to the formation of a lamellar phase, in<br>
15        which the cationic surfactant is dispersed.<br>
By "fatty material" is meant a fatty alcohol, an alkoxylated fatty alcohol, a fatty acid or a mixture thereof.<br>
20        Preferably, the alkyl chain of the fatty material is full saturated.<br>
Representative fatty materials comprise from 8 to 22 carbon atoms, more preferably 16 to 22.  Examples of suitable fatty <br>
25       alcohols include cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol and mixtures thereof.  The use of these materials is also advantageous in that they contribute to the overall conditioning properties of compositions of the invention.<br>
30        Alkoxylated, (e.g. ethoxylated or propoxylated) fatty alcohols having from about 12 to about 18 carbon atoms in<br><br>
     WO 2005/089702<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/001454<br><br>
-   6   -<br>
the alkyl chain can be used in place of, or in addition to, the fatty alcohols themselves.  Suitable examples include ethylene glycol cetyl ether, polyoxyethylene (2) stearyl ether, polyoxyethylene (4) cetyl ether, and mixtures <br>
5         thereof.<br>
The level of fatty alcohol material in conditioners of the invention is suitably from 1 to 10, preferably from 1.5 to 8 and more preferably from 2 to 6 percent by weight of the <br>
10         composition.  The weight ratio of fatty material to total level of quaternary cationic surfactant is preferably from 2:1 to 12:1, more preferably from 2.5:1 to 6:1, most preferably from 3:1 to 6:1<br>
15        Aqueous composition<br>
Compositions according to the invention are preferably aqueous compositions, meaning that they preferably comprise greater than 50% by weight of water, more preferably more <br>
20        than 60%, most preferably more than 70%.<br>
      Conditioning Oil<br>
A preferred further component of compositions according to <br>
25         the invention is hydrophobic conditioning oil. In order for such an oil to exist in the preferred form as discrete droplets in the compositions according to the invention, it must be water-insoluble.  By water-insoluble is meant that the solubility in water at 25°C is 0.01% by weight or less.<br>
30 <br>
      WO 2005/089702<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/001454<br><br>
-   7   -<br>
It is preferred if the conditioning oil is non-volatile, by which it is meant that the vapour pressure of the oil at 25°C is less than 10 Pa.<br>
5         As used herein, the term "conditioning oil" includes any material, which is used to give a particular conditioning benefit to hair.  For example, suitable materials are those, which deliver one or more benefits relating to shine, softness, combability, wet-handling, anti-static properties, <br>
10        and protection against damage, body, volume, stylability and manageability.<br>
Suitable hydrophobic conditioning oils are selected from hydrocarbon oils, fatty esters, silicone oils and mixtures <br>
 15       thereof.<br>
Hydrocarbon oils include cyclic hydrocarbons, straight chain aliphatic hydrocarbons (saturated or unsaturated), and branched chain aliphatic hydrocarbons (saturated or <br>
  20        unsaturated).  Straight chain hydrocarbon oils will preferably contain from about 12 to about 30 carbon atoms. Branched chain hydrocarbon oils can and typically may contain higher numbers of carbon atoms.  Also suitable are polymeric hydrocarbons of alkenyl monomers, such as C2-C6<br>
  25       alkenyl monomers.  These polymers can be straight or branched chain polymers.  The straight chain polymers will typically be relatively short in length, having a total number of carbon atoms as described above for straight chain hydrocarbons in general.  The branched chain polymers can<br>
  30       have substantially higher chain length.  The number average molecular weight of such materials can vary widely, but will<br><br>

typically be up to about 2000, preferably from about 200 to about 1000, more preferably from about 300 to about 600.<br>
       Specific examples of suitable hydrocarbon oils include <br>
5          paraffin oil, mineral oil, saturated and unsaturated dodecane, saturated and unsaturated tridecane, saturated and unsaturated tetradecane, saturated and unsaturated pentadecane, saturated and unsaturated hexadecane, and mixtures thereof.  Branched-chain isomers of these<br>
10         compounds, as well as of higher chain length hydrocarbons, can also be used.  Exemplary branched-chain isomers are highly branched saturated or unsaturated alkanes, such as the permethyl-substituted isomers, e.g., the permethyl-substituted isomers of hexadecane and eicosane, such as 2,<br>
15         2, 4, 4, 6, 6, 8, 8-dimethyl-10-methylundecane and 2, 2, 4, 4, 6, 6-dimethyl-8-methylnonane, sold by Permethyl Corporation.  A further example of a hydrocarbon polymer is polybutene, such as the copolymer of isobutylene and butene. A commercially available material of this type is L-14<br>
20         polybutene from Amoco Chemical Co. (Chicago, 111., U.S.A.).<br>
Particularly preferred hydrocarbon oils are the various grades of mineral oils.  Mineral oils are clear oily liquids obtained from petroleum oil, from which waxes have been<br>
25        removed, and the more volatile fractions removed by distillation. The fraction distilling between 150°C to 300°C is termed mineral oil, and it consists of a mixture of hydrocarbons ranging from C8Hi8 to C2iH44.  Suitable commercially available materials of this type include Cn-Ci3<br>
30        isoparaffin and Sirius M85 and Sirius M125, all available from Silkolene.<br><br>

10        linkages.<br>
Monocarboxylic acid esters include esters of alcohols and/or acids of the formula R'COOR in which R' and R independently denote alkyl or alkenyl radicals and the sum of carbon atoms <br>
15        in R' and R is at least 10, preferably at least 20.<br>

25         The monocarboxylic acid ester need not necessarily contain at least one chain with at least 10 carbon atoms, so long as the total number of aliphatic chain carbon atoms is at least 10.  Examples include isopropyl iso stearate, isopropyl myristate, hexyl laurate, isohexyl laurate, isohexyl<br>

Di- and trialkyl and alkenyl esters of carboxylic acids can also be used.  These include, for example, esters of C4-C8 tricarboxylic acids such as C!-C22 esters (preferably Ci-C6) of succinic acid, glutaric acid, adipic acid, hexanoic acid, <br>
10      heptanoic acid, and octanoic acid.  Examples include diisopropyl adipate, diisohexyl adipate, and diisopropyl sebacate.  Other specific examples include isocetyl stearoyl stearate, and tristearyl citrate.<br>
15      Polyhydric alcohol esters include alkylene glycol esters, for example ethylene glycol mono and di-fatty acid esters, diethylene glycol mono- and di-fatty acid esters, polyethylene glycol mono- and di-fatty acid esters, propylene glycol mono- and di-fatty acid esters,<br>

5        peanut oil, lanolin and soybean oil.  Synthetic oils include triolein and tristearin glyceryl dilaurate.<br>
Specific examples of preferred materials include cocoa butter, palm stearin, sunflower oil, soyabean oil and <br>
10       coconut oil.<br>
The oil may be blended with other materials in the discrete droplets present in compositions according to the invention.<br>
15       It is preferred that the d(0.5) volume-based median particle diameter of the hydrophobic conditioning oil droplets in the composition is less than 100 micrometres, more preferably less than 40 micrometres, even more preferably less than 12 micrometres and most preferably less<br>
20       than 6 micrometres.  Larger particle diameters lead to problems in stabilising the composition from separation of components. Practical difficulties in making emulsion droplets with a median diameter of 0.02 micrometres or less are known to those skilled in the art.  Thus it is preferred<br>
25       if the volume-based median diameter d(0.5) is greater than 0.02 micrometres, more preferably greater than 0.03 micrometres, even more preferably greater than 0.1 micrometres.  Preferred ranges of median diameter can be formed by combining any of the preferred minimum diameters<br>
30       with any of the preferred maximum diameters.<br><br>

PCT/EP2005/001454<br><br>
-   12   -<br>
Volume-based median droplet diameter d(0.5) may be measured by means of a laser light scattering technique, for example using a 2600D Particle Sizer from Malvern Instruments.<br>
5         The total amount of hydrophobic conditioning oil present in the composition is preferably from 0.1% to 10 % by weight of the total composition more preferably from 0.2% to 6%, most preferably 0.5% to 4 %.<br>
10         Silicone Conditioning oils<br>
Preferred hydrophobic conditioning oils for use in compositions according to the invention are silicones.<br>
15         Suitable silicones for use as conditioning oils include polydiorganosiloxanes, in particular polydimethylsiloxanes which have the CTFA designation dimethicone.  Also suitable for use in compositions of the invention are polydimethyl siloxanes having hydroxyl end groups, which have the CTFA<br>
20         designation dimethiconol.<br>
           It is preferred if the silicone oil also comprises a functionalised silicone.  Suitable functionalised silicones include, for example, amino-, carboxy-, betaine-, quaternary 25  ammonium-, carbohydrate-, hydroxy- and alkoxy-substituted<br>
silicones. Preferably, the functionalised silicone contains multiple substitutions.<br>
For the avoidance of doubt, as regards hydroxyl-substituted <br>
30         silicones, a polydimethylsiloxane merely having hydroxyl end groups (which have the CTFA designation dimethiconol) is not<br><br>
     WO 2005/089702<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/001454<br><br>

considered a functionalised silicone within the present invention.  However, a polydimethylsiloxane having hydroxyl substitutions along the polymer chain is considered a functionalised silicone. <br>
5<br>
Preferred functionalised silicones are amino-functionalised silicones.  Suitable amino functionalised silicones are described in EP 455,185 (Helene Curtis) and include trimethylsilylamodimethicone as depicted below, and are <br>
10         sufficiently water insoluble so as to be useful in compositions of the invention:<br>
       Si(CH3)3-0- [Si(CH3)2-0-]x -[Si (CH3) (R-NH-CH2CH2NH2)-0-]y -Si (CH3)3<br>
15<br>
wherein x + y is a number from about 50 to about 500, and the weight percent amine functionality is in the range of from about 0.03% to about 8% by weight of the molecule, and wherein R is an alkylene group having from 2 to 5 carbon<br>
20         atoms.  Preferably, the number x + y is in the range of from about 100 to about 300, and the weight percent amine functionality is in the range of from about 0.03% to 8% by weight of the molecule.<br>
25         As expressed here, the weight percent amine functionality is measured by titrating a sample of the amino-functionalised silicone against alcoholic hydrochloric acid to the bromocresol green end point.  The weight percent amine is calculated using a molecular weight of 45 (corresponding to<br>
30          CH3- CH2-NH2) .<br><br>
