				<td>Propylene polymer composition<br>
The present invention is related to a new propylene polymer having a low<br>
amount of impurities as well as to the process of the same and its use.<br>
Conventional polymers contaminated with impurities - although sometimes<br>
in rather low levels - make the polymer unsuitable for certain end<br>
applications such as capacitor films or for certain food or medical<br>
applications where a high purity is needed. The ash content of the polymer<br>
product is one of the indicators of the undesired impurities. The impurities<br>
include metallic and non-metallic impurities, which are often originating<br>
from the catalyst system used for the polymerization, particularly<br>
aluminum, titanium, silicon, halogen (such as CI and F) and boron residues.<br>
This specific problem may arise especially in cases where supported<br>
metallocene catalysts are employed since due to the low activities of the<br>
same usually considerably high amounts of catalyst are needed. As a<br>
negative side effect, the polymer product is contaminated with high amount<br>
of residual catalyst components. To achieve very low levels of these<br>
residues, the polymer products are often washed after production.<br>
Of course for high demanding applications not only the amount of<br>
impurities should be considered but also the mechanical properties as for<br>
example the stiffness of the product.<br>
WO 02/16455 discloses a propylene homopolymer with a molecular weight<br>
distribution (MWD) of 1.7 to 5. The pentad content of this polymer is<br>
higher than 93 % and the xylene solubles (XS) is lower than 1 wt.-%.<br>
Moreover, the aluminum and chloride levels in this propylene<br>
homopolymer are lower than 25 ppm. The polymer is prepared by a two-<br>
stage process using metallocene catalyst supported on fluorinated silica in<br>
the presence of a highly fluorinated trisarylboron activator compound. The<br>
aluminum and chloride level in this propylene homopolymer is reduced i.a.<br>
due to the use of a boron-based cocatalyst, which in turn can provide boron<br>
residues to the polymer.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide further propylene<br>
polymers having a low amount of impurities making the product suitable<br>
for high demanding end applications as for example capacitor films, food<br><br>
-2-<br>
packaging or medical packaging articles. Preferably propylene polymer is<br>
suitable for end applications requiring good mechanical properties as inter<br>
alia a high stiffness.<br>
The finding of the present invention is that a propylene polymer can be<br>
produced which contains significantly reduced amounts of residues in the<br>
final propylene polymer enabling the use of the polymer in demanding end<br>
applications without that any washing step is needed. Also a method using<br>
a very feasible catalyst system for producing such polymer is provided.<br>
Hence, the patent invention provides a propylene polymer which<br>
particularly comprises a low Al-content and advantageously low amounts<br>
of other residues mainly originating from the catalyst. Accordingly, the<br>
propylene polymer of the invention comprises an aluminum residue content<br>
of less than 25 ppm, more preferably less than 10 ppm, still more<br>
preferably less than 9 ppm and boron residue content of less than 25 ppm,<br>
more preferably less than 10 ppm, still more preferably less than 9 ppm.<br>
Such a polymer with very low amounts of metallic or non-metallic residues<br>
arising from the catalyst component makes it suitable for high demanding<br>
applications, wherein the presence of such residues should be avoided, as<br>
for example for capacitor films or for food packaging or medical packaging<br>
articles.<br>
In a very preferable embodiment the propylene polymer comprises the<br>
above low content of Al- and B-residues and additionally a reduced amount<br>
of silicon (Si) residues or chlorine (CI) residues or a reduced amount of<br>
both silicon and chlorine residues. Preferably the silicon residues content in<br>
the propylene polymer is less than 10 ppm, more preferably less than 5<br>
ppm. Depending on the desired end application, the polypropylene polymer<br>
may contain Si-residues even less than 1 ppm. The chlorine content in the<br>
propylene polymer is less than 10 ppm, more preferably less than 5 ppm.<br>
Depending on the desired end application the polymer propylene of the<br>
invention may contain even as low as 1 ppm of Cl-residues.<br>
In a further embodiment the total amount of aluminum, boron and silicon<br>
residues is less than 10 ppm. In another embodiment the total amount of Al,<br>
B, Si and CI is less than 15 ppm, more preferably less than 10 ppm.<br><br>
-3-<br>
The terms "aluminium (Al), boron (B), chlorine (CI) or silicon (Si)<br>
content" or "A1-, B-, CI- or Si-residue" used above and below mean any<br>
residues of Al, B, CI and Si, in elementary or non-elementary form (e.g.<br>
ionic/non-ionic form, such as in a form of an oxide) that are mainly<br>
originating from the catalyst and can be recovered from the propylene<br>
polymer. These residues may be determined using the methods as defined<br>
later below under "Determination methods and definitions".<br>
In a preferred embodiment the propylene polymer is avoid of any boron<br>
residues that originate from the catalyst system. The catalyst system<br>
includes one or more catalyst components selected from one or more<br>
catalytically active component and optionally one or more activators as the<br>
cocatalyst. The components can be combined, e.g. supported on a carrier<br>
material, before the catalyst system is subjected to a polymerization reactor<br>
or they can be added separately to the polymerization reactor.<br>
The purity of the propylene polymer can be further characterized by the<br>
amount of its volatiles. The volatiles are substances being driven off as<br>
vapor at room or slightly elevated temperatures, from a polymer. Hence, it<br>
is preferred that the volatiles content is lower than 400 ppm, more<br>
preferably lower than 300 ppm, still more preferred lower than 200 ppm.<br>
The volatiles content may be determined by the method described later<br>
below under "Determination methods and definitions".<br>
Not only the amount of volatiles, but preferably also the amount of non-<br>
volatile residues may significantly be reduced in the propylene polymer of<br>
the invention. The ash content is the non-volatile inorganic matter of a<br>
composition which remains after subjecting it to a high decomposition<br>
temperature. The ash content may be determined by the method described<br>
later below under "Determination methods and definitions" It is in<br>
particular preferred that the ash content of the propylene polymer is less<br>
than 50 ppm, more preferably less than 40 ppm and most preferably less<br>
than 30 ppm.<br>
In a preferable embodiment, especially for the above mentioned high<br>
demanding applications, the propylene polymer is a high crystalline<br>
propylene polymer. A high crystalline propylene polymer is characterized<br>
by a high stereoregularity, i.e. high isotacticity. Generally, a high isotactic<br><br>
-4-<br>
propylene polymer is preferred as it has better mechanical properties, in<br>
particular an improved stiffness. Therefore, it is preferred that the<br>
propylene polymer has an isotacticity expressed in mmmm pentad<br>
concentration of at least 0.940, more preferably of at least 0.945 and still<br>
more preferably of at least 0.950, determined by NMR-spectroscopy (for<br>
the determination method see below under "Determination methods and<br>
definitions").<br>
Xylene solubles a part of the polymer soluble in cold xylene determined by<br>
dissolution in boiling xylene and letting the insoluble part crystallize from<br>
the cooling solution (for the method see below "Determination methods and<br>
definitions"). The xylene solubles fraction contains polymer chains with<br>
low molecular weight and low stereo-regularity. Hence, as a preferable<br>
embodiment of the invention the propylene polymer having a high<br>
crystallinity has xylene solubles below 2.0 wt.-%, more preferably below<br>
1.5 wt.-% and still more preferably below 1.0 wt.-%.<br>
The molecular weight distribution (MWD) (also determined herein as<br>
polydispersity) is the relation between the numbers of molecules in a<br>
polymer and the individual chain length. The molecular weight distribution<br>
can be measured e.g. by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), whereby it<br>
is expressed as the ratio of weight average molecular weight (Mw) and<br>
number average molecular weight (Mn). Number average molecular weight<br>
(Mn) and weight average molecular weight (Mw) as well as the molecular<br>
weight distribution (MWD) are determined according to ISO 16014.<br>
As a broad molecular weight distribution improves the processability of the<br>
propylene polymer, therefore, advantageously the polydispersity (Mw/Mn)<br>
is up to 20, preferably up to 10, more preferably up to 8. In an alternative<br>
embodiment the polydispersity (Mw/Mn) is between 1 to 8.<br>
Moreover, the molecular weight of a polymer can be further expressed by<br>
way of its melt flow rate (MFR). The melt flow rate (MFR) mainly depends<br>
on the average molecular weight. An increase in molecular weight means a<br>
decrease in the MFR-value.<br>
The melt flow rate MFR is measured in g/10 min of the polymer discharged<br>
under specific temperature and pressure conditions and is the measure of a<br><br>
-5-<br>
viscosity of a polymer. Melt flow rate measured under a load of 2.16 kg<br>
(ISO 1133) is denoted as MFR2.<br>
It is preferred that the propylene polymer has an MFR2 of up to 10 g/10<br>
min, more preferably up to 6 g/10 min, still more preferably up to 4 g/10<br>
min. A preferred range for the MFR2 is 1 to 10 g/10 min.<br>
The propylene polymer includes both homo- and copolymers of propylene.<br>
A homopolymer according to this invention has less than 0.2 wt.-%, more<br>
preferably less than 0.1 wt.-%, still more preferably less than 0.05 wt.-%,<br>
yet more preferably less than 0.005 wt.-%, other alpha-olefins than<br>
propylene in the polymer. Most preferred no other alpha-olefins are<br>
detectable.<br>
In case the propylene polymer is a propylene copolymer, the copolymer is<br>
preferably a random propylene copolymer. The comonomers can be<br>
selected from the list consisting of ethylene, C4-alpha-olefin, C5-alpha-<br>
olefin, C6.alpha-olefin, C7-alpha-olefin, Cg-alpha-olefin, C9-alpha-olefin,<br>
Cio-alpha-olefin, Cn-alpha-olefin and C12-alpha-olefm. The alpha-olefins<br>
can be linear, branched, aliphatic cyclic or aromatic cyclic alpha-olefins.<br>
Preferably, the comonomer is ethylene. The amount of the comonomer is<br>
not limited and e.g. conventionally used amounts can be used deoending on<br>
the desired end application. In one embodiment the content of the<br>
comonomer in the propylene copolymer may be up to 2 wt.-%, preferably<br>
up to 1.5 wt.-%. In another embodiment lower amounts e.g. up to 0.8 wt.-<br>
%, preferably up to 0.5 wt.-% may be desired.<br>
Preferably the propylene polymer is a homopolymer.<br>
The invention further covers both unimodal and multimodal propylene<br>
polymers with respect to the molecular weight distribution (MWD).<br>
A propylene polymer with a broad molecular weight distribution (MWD) may be<br>
unimodal (very broad single maxima) or multimodal, preferably bimodal, with<br>
respect to the weight average molecular weight distribution (MWD).<br>
"Multimodal" or "multimodal distribution" describes a frequency<br>
distribution that has several relative maxima. In particular, the expression<br>
"modality of a polymer" refers to the form of its molecular weight<br><br>
-6-<br>
distribution (MWD) curve, i.e. the appearance of the graph of the polymer<br>
weight fraction as a function of its molecular weight.<br>
The molecular weight distribution (MWD) of polymer produced in a single<br>
polymerization stage using a single monomer mixture, a single<br>
polymerization catalyst and a single set of process conditions (i.e.<br>
temperature, pressure, etc.) shows a single maximum the breadth of which<br>
depends on catalyst choice, reactor choice, process conditions, etc., i.e.<br>
such a polymer is unimodal.<br>
As an alternative for a unimodal propylene, the invention covers also a<br>
propylene polymer which comprises at least the two components<br>
(i) a propylene homopolymer or copolymer and<br>
(ii) another propylene homopolymer or copolymer<br>
which components (i) and (ii) are different with respect to the weight<br>
average molecular weight (Mw) and/or in the comonomer distribution.<br>
If component (i) or component (ii) or both are copolymers, these are<br>
preferably random copolymers. Furthermore, the components (i) and (ii)<br>
may have the same or different comonomer contents. In case of different<br>
comonomer contents the propylene polymer has multimodality with respect<br>
to the comonomer distribution.<br>
It is preferred that one of the components (i) and (ii) has a lower molecular<br>
weight and thus higher MFR than the other of components (i) and (ii), i.e. than<br>
the higher molecular weight component. Accordingly, as a further embodiment,<br>
at least a bimodal propylene polymer, preferably at least a bimodal<br>
homopropylene, is provided which comprises a lower molecular weight (LMW)<br>
component and a higher molecular weight (HMW) component. The weight ratios<br>
thereof may vary. The amount of component (i) may be 30 to 70 wt-%,<br>
preferably 40 to 60 wt-%, more preferably 45 to 55 wt.-% and the amount of<br>
component (ii) may be 30 to 70 wt-%, preferably 40 to 60 wt.-%, more<br>
preferably 45 to 55 wt.-%, calculated from the total propylene polymer.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the propylene polymer as described above is a<br>
reactor-made propylene polymer (also called as a reactor powder). The<br>
reactor-made propylene polymer means herein the reaction product as obtained<br>
from the polymerization process, i.e. the reactor-made propylene polymer has not<br><br>
-7-<br>
been subjected to any washing or treatment step to decrease or remove (1) the<br>
Al- and B-residues, preferably the A1-, B-, CI- and Si-residues, which mainly<br>
originate from the catalyst. Also preferably, the reactor-made propylene polymer<br>
has not been subjected to (2) any deashing step in a manner known in the art to<br>
decrease or remove the ash content of the polymer. If desired, the reactor-made<br>
propylene polymer of this embodiment may then further be treated in a<br>
subsequent treatment step, e.g. washing step, in a known manner for optimizing,<br>
e.g. for further reducing one or more of the following: Al, B, CI, Si and ash<br>
content of the product.<br>
Moreover, it is in particular preferred that the propylene polymer is<br>
obtainable by a single site catalyst (SSC) polymerization. The SSC includes<br>
metallocene and non-metallocene catalysts as known in the art. Preferably,<br>
the propylene polymer is obtainable by a metallocene catalysed<br>
polymerization, more preferably using the process and/or catalyst as<br>
defined below.<br>
In a further advantageous embodiment, the propylene polymer is obtainable<br>
by a solid, non-silica supported catalyst, preferably solid non-silica<br>
supported single site -based catalyst, such as a metallocene-based catalyst.<br>
According to a further preferable embodiment of the invention, the<br>
propylene polymer as defined above is obtainable by a solid catalyst which<br>
(1) comprises at least a metallocene complex as a catalytically active<br>
component, optionally together with an activator as the cocatalyst and (2)<br>
has a productivity of at least 30 kg PP/g catalyst, typically of at least 40 kg<br>
PP/g catalyst, preferably of at least 50 kg/PP/g catalyst, more preferably of<br>
at least 60 kg PP/g catalyst. The productivity as defined above is a known<br>
expression in the field and describes the catalytic activity of the catalyst.<br>
The term "kg PP/g catalyst" means the amount of polypropylene produced<br>
with 1 g of the catalyst.<br>
In addition, the present invention comprises also the use of the propylene<br>
polymer as described above as such or as a component of a polymer blend<br>
in various end use applications with high purity requirements. Accordingly,<br>
the invention further provides an article comprising the propylene polymer<br>
of the invention. Such articles include containers and packaging articles for<br>
medical, food and electrical applications (such as capacitor film applications).<br><br>
-8-<br>
Accordingly, the propylene polymer can be processed as such or as a blend<br>
with further polymer component(s), optionally in the presence with<br>
additives (such as well known in the art) to produce various end<br>
applications in a known manner. E.g. the propylene polymer can be<br>
moulded or extruded to articles, e.g. for films, mono- and biaxially oriented<br>
films, fibers and molded articles. Such extruded or molded articles include<br>
mono- and multilayered articles as known in the art. Furthermore, films<br>
include cast and blown films. Due to the high purity the inventive<br>
propylene polymer is very feasible in the field of food packaging and<br>
medical packaging, as well as in electrical applications.<br>
Moreover the present invention is directed to a layered structure, preferably<br>
a film, which comprises at least one layer comprising the propylene<br>
polymer as defined above. Preferably the layers of the film consist<br>
essentially of the propylene polymer as defined above. In addition, the film<br>
comprising the inventive propylene polymer may be a bi-oriented film<br>
and/or a capacitor film.<br>
The articles including films can be produced according to or analogously to<br>
methods well known in the art.<br>
Moreover, the present invention provides also a polymerization process for<br>
producing the propylene polymer.<br>
The process for preparing the inventive propylene polymer comprises at<br>
least the step of polymerizing propylene in the presence of a catalyst,<br>
preferably non-silica supported catalyst. "Non-silica supported catalyst"<br>
means herein that part or all of the active catalyst components have not<br>
been supported on a solid, porous silica-based carrier material as is the case<br>
in a silica-supported catalyst, wherein the catalyst component(s) are<br>
conventionally impregnated to the pores of silica carrier particles.<br>
In principal any polymerization method including slurry and gas phase<br>
polymerization can be used for producing the polymer composition. Slurry<br>
polymerization is preferably a bulk polymerization. "Bulk" means a<br>
polymerization in a reaction medium comprising at least 60 wt.-%<br>
monomer.<br><br>
-9-<br>
The invention also provides a process for producing the propylene polymer<br>
comprising at least a propylene homo- or copolymer component (i) as<br>
defined above, wherein the propylene, optionally together with one or more<br>
comonomers, are polymerized in the presence of a polymerization catalyst.<br>
In case the propylene polymer consists of component (i) only the process is<br>
a single stage process.<br>
In case a multimodal, e.g. at least bimodal, polymer comprising at least two<br>
different components (i) and (ii) with different molecular weight<br>
distribution (MWD) and/or with different comonomer contents, the<br>
propylene polymer may be produced by blending each or part of the<br>
components in-situ during the polymerization process thereof (in-situ<br>
process) or, alternatively, by blending mechanically two or more separately<br>
produced components in a manner known in the art.<br>
It is also possible to produce a multimodal propylene polymer in one<br>
reactor by selecting e.g. one or more of (1) changing polymerization<br>
conditions, (2) using at least two different catalysts, (3) using multi site,<br>
e.g. dual site catalysts and (4) using at least two different comonomer<br>
feeds.<br>
Alternatively, the invention further provides a process for producing a<br>
propylene polymer comprising at least two different propylene homo- or<br>
copolymer components (i) and (ii) as defined above, wherein each<br>
component (i) and (ii) is produced by polymerizing propylene, optionally<br>
together with one or more comonomers, in the presence of a polymerization<br>
catalyst in a multistage polymerization process using one or more<br>
polymerization reactors, which may be the same or different, e.g. at least<br>
loop-loop, gas-gas or any combination of loop and gas reactors. Each stage<br>
may be effected in parallel or sequentially using the same or different<br>
polymerization method(s). In case of a sequential stages each components,<br>
e.g. (i) and (ii), may be produced in any order by carrying out the<br>
polymerization in each step, except the first step, in the presence of the<br>
polymer component formed, in the preceding step. Preferably, the catalyst<br>
used and added in the first step is present in the subsequent step(s).<br>
Alternatively, the same or different catalyst can be added in the subsequent<br>
step(s).<br><br>
-10-<br>
Multistage processes include also bulk/gas phase reactors known as<br>
multizone gas phase reactors for producing multimodal propylene polymer.<br>
Thus a further embodiment provides a process for producing any of the<br>
above polymer composition, which comprises (i) a propylene homo- or<br>
copolymer component and, optionally, (ii) an propylene homo- or<br>
copolymer component, wherein the process includes a step of:<br>
(a)	polymerizing in a slurry reactor, preferably a loop reactor, propylene,<br>
optionally together with one of more comonomers, in the presence of a<br>
polymerization catalyst to produce a first propylene polymer<br>
component (one of components (i) and (ii)), and,<br>
optionally, transferring the reaction product of step (a) to a subsequent<br>
gas phase reactor and<br>
(b)	polymerizing in a gas phase reactor propylene, optionally together<br>
with one or more comonomers, in the presence of the reaction product<br>
of step (a) to produce a second polymer component (the other of<br>
components (i) and (ii)) for obtaining the propylene polymer, and<br>
recovering the obtained composition.<br>
A preferred multistage process is a "loop-gas phase"-process, such as<br>
developed by Borealis A/S, Denmark (known as BORSTAR® technology)<br>
described e.g. in patent literature, such as in EP 0887 379 or in<br>
W092/12182.<br>
If the polymer composition has at least a multimodal MWD, then the lower<br>
molecular weight (LMW) fraction and the higher molecular weight (HMW)<br>
fraction can be made in different steps (a) and (b), in any order.<br>
Optionally, and preferably, the process may also comprise a<br>
prepolymerization step in a manner known in the field and which may<br>
precede the polymerisation step (a).<br>
If desired, a further elastomeric comonomer component, so-called rubber<br>
component, may be incorporated into the obtained propylene polymer to<br>
form a heterophasic copolymer of the polymer mentioned above. The<br>
rubber component, preferably elastomeric propylene copolymer, with at<br><br>
-11 -<br>
least ethylene comonomer, may preferably be produced after the gas phase<br>
polymerization step (b) in a subsequent second or further gas phase<br>
polymerizations using one or more gas phase reactors.<br>
The process is preferably a continuous process.<br>

The above described active catalyst components are commercially available<br>
or may be prepared according to the methods described in the literature. As<br>
an example of feasible single site catalysts, preferably metallocenes, and<br><br>
- 17-<br>
the preparation methods thereof, reference is made to the above<br>
WO03/051934, as well as to EP836608, EP 576 970 and EP722 956,<br>
without limiting to these.<br>
As mentioned above the catalyst system may further comprise an activator<br>
as a cocatalyst, as described in WO 03051934, which is enclosed hereby<br>
with reference.<br>
Preferred as cocatalysts for metallocenes and non-metallocenes, if desired,<br>
are the aluminoxanes, in particular the Cl-ClO-alkylaluminoxanes, most<br>
particularly methylaluminoxane (MAO). Such aluminoxanes can be used as<br>
the sole cocatalyst or together with other cocatalyst(s). Thus besides or in<br>
addition to aluminoxanes, other cation complex forming catalysts activators<br>
can be used. Said activators are commercially available or can be prepared<br>
according to the prior art literature.<br>
Further aluminoxane cocatalysts are described i.a. in WO-A-9428034<br>
which is incorporated herein by reference. These are linear or cyclic<br>
oligomers of having up to 40, preferably 3 to 20, -(A1(R"')0)- repeat units<br>
(wherein R'" is hydrogen, Cl-ClO-alkyl (preferably methyl) or C6-C18-<br>
aryl or mixtures thereof).<br>
The use and amounts of such activators are within the skills of an expert in<br>
the field. As an example, with the boron activators, 5:1 to 1:5, preferably<br>
2:1 to 1:2, such as 1:1, ratio of the transition metal to boron activator may<br>
be used. In case of preferred aluminoxanes, such as methylaluminumoxane<br>
(MAO), the amount of Al, provided by aluminoxane, can be chosen to<br>
provide a molar ratio of Al: transition metal e.g. in the range of 1 to 10 000,<br>
suitably 5 to 8000, preferably 10 to 7000, e.g. 100 to 4000, such as 1000 to<br>
3000. Typically in case of solid (heterogeneous) catalyst the ratio is<br>
preferably below 500.<br>
The quantity of cocatalyst to be employed in the catalyst of the invention is<br>
thus variable, and depends on the conditions and the particular transition<br>
metal compound chosen in a manner well known to a person skilled in the<br>
art.<br><br>

Any additional components to be contained in the solution comprising the<br>
organotransition compound may be added to said solution before or,<br>
alternatively, after the dispersing step.<br>
Determination Methods and Definitions<br>
The following definitions of terms and determination methods apply for the<br>
above general description of the invention as well as to the below examples<br>
unless otherwise defined.<br>
Elementary analysis<br>
The below described elementary analysis was used for determining the content of<br>
the elementary residues which are mainly originating from the catalyst,<br>
especially the A1-, B- and Si-residues in the polymer. Said A1-, B- and Si-<br>
residues can be in any form, e.g. in elementary or ionic form, which can be<br>
recovered and detected from the propylene polymer using e.g. the below<br>
described ICP-method. The method can also be used for determining the Ti<br>
content of the polymer. It is understood that also other known methods can be<br>
used which would result in similar results.<br>
ICP (Inductively coupled plasma emission) -spectrometry<br>
ICP-instrument: The instrument for determination of A1-, Si- and B-content was<br>
ICP Optima 2000 DV, PSN 620785 (supplier PerkinElmer Instruments, Belgium)<br>
with the software of the instrument.<br>
Detection limits are 0,1 ppm (Al), 0,1 ppm (Si) and 0,1 ppm (B).<br>
The polymer sample was first ashed in a known manner, then dissolved in an<br>
appropriate acidic solvent. The dilutions of the standards for the calibration curve<br>
are dissolved in the same solvent as the sample and the concentrations chosen so<br>
that the concentration of the sample would fall within the standard calibration<br>
curve.<br>
ppm: means parts per million by weight.<br>
Ash content: Ash content is measured according to ISO 3451-1 (1997)<br>
standard.<br><br>
-19-<br>
Calculated ash, Al- and B-content:<br>
The ash and the above listed elements, Al and/or B can also be calculated<br>
from a propylene polymer based on the polymerization activity of the<br>
catalyst as exemplified in the examples. These values would give the upper<br>
limit of the presence of said residues originating from the catalyst.<br>
Thus the estimate catalyst residues is based on catalyst composition and<br>
polymerization productivity, catalyst residues in the polymer can be<br>
estimated according to:<br>
Total catalyst residues [ppm] = 1/ productivity [kgPP/gcatalyst] *1000<br>
Al residues [ppm]= wAl,Catalyst [%] * total catalyst residues [ppm] /TOO<br>
Zr-residues [ppm] = wZr,Calatyst [%] * total catalyst residues [ppm] /100<br>
(Similar calculations apply also e.g. for B, CI and Si residues)<br>
Particle size distribution: is measured via Coulter Counter LS 200 at<br>
room temperature with n-heptane as medium.<br>
NMR<br>
NMR-spectroscopy measurements:<br>

spectrometer at 130 °C from samples dissolved in 1,2,4-<br>
trichlorobenzene/benzene-d6 (90/10 w/w). For the pentad analysis the<br>
assignment is done according to the methods described in literature.<br>
(T. Hayashi, Y. Inoue, R. Chiijo, and T. Asakura, Polymer 29 138-43<br>
(1988).and Chujo R, et al,Polymer 35 339(1994).<br>
The NMR-measurement was used for determining the mmmm pentad<br>
concentration in a manner well known in the art.<br>

A Millipore Waters ALC/GPC operating at 135 °C and equipped with two mixed<br>
bed and one 107 A TSK-Gel columns (TOSOHAAS 16S) and a differential<br>
refractometer detector. The solvent 1,2,4-trichlorobezene was applied at flow rate<br>
of 1 ml/min. The columns were calibrated with narrow molecular weight<br>
distribution polystyrene standards and narrow and broad polypropylenes.<br>

30±2 minutes the solution was allowed to cool for 15 minutes at ambient<br>
temperature and then allowed to settle for 30 minutes at 25±0.5°C. The solution<br>
was filtered and evaporated in nitrogen flow and the residue dried under vacuum<br>
at 90°C until constant weight is reached.<br>

mo= initial polymer amount (g)<br>
mi= weight of residue (g)<br>

crystallinity: measured with Mettler TA820 differential scanning calorimetry<br>
(DSC) on 5-10 mg samples. Both crystallization and melting curves were<br>
obtained during 10°C/min cooling and heating scans between 30°C and 225°C.<br>
