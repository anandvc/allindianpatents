				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to transformer cores and especially to three-phase<br>
and one-phase cores comprising regularly multi-edged legs.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Three-phase transformer cores are usually made of transformer plates cut to E I shape for<br>
small transformers and to rectangular plates, which are laid edge to edge, in larger<br>
transformers. They have the drawback that the magnetic field has to pass via edges from<br>
plate to plate and that the magnetic field must go an unnecessarily long way and not always<br>
along a magnetic orientation.<br>
Designers of transformer cores have striven to obtain legs with an essentially circular cross-<br>
section because that gives the best efficiency of the final transformer. However, there is<br>
always a trade-off between efficiency and production requirements, leading to non-optimal<br>
transformer cores with non-circular legs.<br>
Strips cores for three-phase transformers have hitherto been difficult to manufacture. The<br>
efficiency of the core can be increased by cutting strips to variable width and winding rings,<br>
which are given a circular cross-section for single-phase transformers and semi-circular cross-<br>
section for three-phase transformers. This method results in a great deal of waste and the<br>
winding process is time consuming.<br>
US 4,557,039 (Manderson) discloses a method of manufacturing transformer cores using<br>
electrical steel strips having approximately a linear taper. By selecting a suitable taper, a<br>
hexagonal or higher order approximation of a circular cross section for the legs of the cores is<br>
produced. However, the tapered strips are difficult and time-consuming to produce and the<br>
design is not well adapted to large-scale production.<br>
In figs, la-c is shown a prior art three-phase transformer core according to Manderson,<br>
generally designated 10. The core has a general delta-shape, as is seen in the isometric views<br>
of fig. l,with three legs interconnected by yoke parts. In fig. la, a cross-sectional view of the<br>
core is shown before final assemble. The core comprises three identical ring-shaped parts 12,<br>
13, and 14, the general shape of which appears from fig. 1. Each ring-shaped part fills up one<br>
half of two legs with hexagonal cross-sections, see fig. la, thus totaling the three legs of a<br>
three-phase transformer. The ring-shaped parts are initially wound from constant width strips<br>
to three identical rings 12a, 13a, 14a with rhombic cross-sections comorising two angles of 60<br>
degrees and two angles of 120 degrees. These rings 12a-14a constitute the basic rings. The<br>
orientation of the strips also appears from figs, la and lb.<br>
Outside of the basic ring in each ring-shaped part there is an outer ring 12b,13b,14b of a<br>
regular triangular cross-section. The outer rings are wound from strips with constantly<br>
decreasing width.<br>
When the three ring-shaped parts 12-14 are put together, see fig. lb they form three<br>
hexagonal legs on which the transformer windings are wound.<br>
A drawback with this solution is that every size of transformer requires its own cutting of the<br>
strips. Also, the outer rings 12b-14b are made of strips with decreasing width, leading to<br>
waste and it also makes the transformer according to Manderson difficult to manufacture.<br>
Transformer cores are also described in the following documents: SE 163797, US 2,458,112,<br>
US 2,498,747, US 2,400,184 and US 2,544,871. However, the above mentioned problems are<br>
not overcome by the cores described in this documents.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a transformer core wherein the energy tosses<br>
are minimised.<br>
Another object is to provide a transformer core, which is easy to manufacture and avoids<br>
material waste.<br>
Another object is to provide a method of manufacturing a transformer that is well adapted for<br>
large-scale production.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is based on the realization that a transformer core with one or more regularly<br>
multi-edged legs with more than four edges can be wound of strips of material with constant<br>
width.<br>
According to the invention there is provided a transformer core, comprising at least one leg<br>
and at least one yoke part, wherein the cross-section of said at least one leg is regularly multi-<br>
edged with more than four edges, characterised in that the core is made up of rings rolled<br>
from strips of constant width.<br>
Further preferred embodiments are defined in the dependent claims.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Preferred embodiments of a three-phase transformer core according to the invention will now<br>
be described.<br>
Fig. 1 has already been discussed in connection with prior art and will not be explained<br>
further.<br>
In fig. 2 is shown a three-phase transformer core according to the invention, generally<br>
designated 20. In its general shape it is similar to the prior art transformer core shown in fig. 1<br>
with a general delta-shape but is designed in an entirely different way.<br>
The core is made up of three ring-shaped parts 22,23,24 comprising several rings. These come<br>
in two widths, broad or narrow wherein the narrow rings are made up of strips of half the<br>
width of the broad rings. Also, they come in two heights, bw or high wherein the low rings<br>
have half the height of the high rings. Unless otherwise stated, these definitions will be used<br>
throughout this description. The strips are preferably made of transformer plate.<br>
Each of the ring-shaped parts 22-24 comprises a broad high basic ring 22a-24a, respectively,<br>
similar to those described with reference to fig. 1. Thus, these rings form in pairs four of the<br>
sides in the hexagonal legs. The remaining rhombs in the legs are built in different ways, see<br>
figs. 2a and 2b.<br>
In the first leg 25 in the background, the additional rhombic cross-section is composed of two<br>
rhomboids. The first one, designated 24b and belonging to ring-shaped part 24, is a broad bw<br>
ring. The second one, designated 22b and belonging to ring-shaped part 22, is a narrow high<br>
ring.<br>
In the second leg 26 to the right in fig.2, the additional rhombic cross-section is composed of<br>
one rhomboid and two rhombs. The rhomboid is filled by the narrow high ring 22b belonging<br>
to the ring-shaped part 22. The rhombs are filled by two narrow bw rings 23b, 23c belonging<br>
to the ring-shaped part 23.<br>
In the third leg 27 to the left in fig .2, the additional rhombic cross-section is also composed of<br>
one rhomboid and two rhombs. The rhomboid is filled by the broad bw ring 24b belonging to<br>
the ring-shaped part 24. The rhombs are filled by two narrow bw rings 23b, 23c belonging to<br>
the ring-shaped part 23. The reason that the ring-shaped part 23 comprises two bw narrow<br>
rings instead of one larger ring is that this larger ring can not be both narrow and high,<br>
as required in the left leg 27, and broad and low, as required in the right leg 26. Thus, instead<br>
two narrow low rings are used.<br>
All upper or lower yokes connecting the legs 25-27 have different shapes but all are built from<br>
one basic ring with a large rhombic cross-section plus one ring with a rhomboidal cross-section<br>
or two rings with a small rhombic cross-section. This gives all yokes the same total cross-<br>
section area.<br>
A second preferred embodiment is described with reference Figs. 3 and 3a-3q. This<br>
embodiment is for a three-phase transformer core having three frames 32-34 arranged in a<br>
triangular or delta pattern. (It should be noted that in a three-phase transformer core with<br>
hexagonal legs and yokes in a triangle, the innermost parts of the cross sections of the rings<br>
must be 60Â°. This is the definition of the orientation of the angle notations in this<br>
applications.) As explained below, the core has three legs, each of which extends through a<br>
transformer coil. The frames are composed of rings, each ring being a wound sheet of<br>
transformer plate sheet metal, the layers of each of which are offset, i.e. splayed or profiled.<br>
In cross-section, the legs form regular hexagons. The terms referred to earlier (broad, narrow,<br>
thick, thin, etc.) have the same meaning as they did earlier.<br>
Referring first to fig.3, a three-phase transformer core 30 is shown. Core 30 has frames<br>
32,33,34. Each frame has vertically extending portions that run between opposite ends of a<br>
pair of opposed yokes. As explained below, the legs of each frame cooperate with legs of<br>
adjacent frame frames to form legs 35,36 and 37 of transformer core 30. Since each frame is<br>
identical to the other frames, only frame 32 will be discussed.<br>
Frame 32 has a broad, thick ring 32a, a narrow thin ring. 32b which goes partly over ring 32a,<br>
and a narrow thin ring 32c which goes partly over ring 32b. Ring 32 is shown alone in fig. 3c.<br>
Fig.3c is a rear view of frame 32a, viewed from inside core 30. It can be seen in fig.3c that<br>
broad, thick ring 32a is lying in one plane, that ring 32b has an edge lying on the forward<br>
edge of ring 32a as viewed on the left portion of fig. 3c, but is located so that the right edge<br>
of ring 32b is sitting near the rear edge of ring 32a. Ring 32c has its left hand surface flush<br>
against the left hand surface of ring 32b, and then is arranged so that it crossed over ring 32b<br>
and that its offset or splayed surface, labeled 301 is aligned with the offset or splayed surface<br>
302 of ring 32b. The right hand edge of ring 32a is forward of the splayed portion of ring 32b.<br>
The splayed surface 303 of ring 32a angled in the opposite direction of surfaces 301 and 302.<br>
Frame 32 is shown the exploded form in fig.3d. It can again be seen that broad thick ring 32a<br>
is a wound ring, with its layers being skewed or inclined so that its innermost strip in the<br>
profile extends forwardly, out of the plane of the paper. Narrow thin ring 32c has its layers<br>
skewed inwardly, towards the plane of the paper, that is, opposite to the direction of the<br>
offset of ring 32a, as noted above, Ring 32b is narrow and thin, and the direction of the offset<br>
of its layers is the same as that of ring 32c. Fig. 3e shows a portion of frame 32 in cross-<br>
section. Ring 32a is at the innermost part of frame 32, ring 32b is close to the forward edge of<br>
ring 32a when viewed in the left hand corner of Fig. 3e, and then extends partly through ring<br>
32a as can be seen from the direction of the windings of 32b in fig.3e. The latter is indicated<br>
by the angle u in fig. 3n.Narrow, thin ring 32c is rearward of ring 32b as shown in fig.3e, but<br>
is wound around and sits on ring 32b as can be seen in the right hand portion of frame 32.<br>
The cross-section shown in fig.3e on the left-hand portion shows a rhombus 32a and two<br>
rhomboids 32b and 32c. A cross-section showing all three frames 32,33, and 34 is shown in<br>
fig. 3a. This will be discussed, briefly, below.<br>
Fig. 3f is a top cross sectional view of frame 32 in fig.3c. It shows broad thick ring 32a, narrow<br>
thin ring 32b, and narrow thin ring 32c. The offsetting or splaying of the profiled rings 32a, b<br>
and c is clear from this view. Ring 32a is lower in the foreground and higher in the<br>
background. Rings 32b and 32c are higher in the foreground and lower in the background.<br>
The dimension "w" shows the width of ring 32a, and the width of rings 32b and 32c are "w/2".<br>
The thickness of ring 32a is shown as "t" and the thickness of each of rings 32b and 32c are<br>
"t/2".<br>
Fig. 3g is similar to fig.3a, and fig 3h is similar to fig 3b, and they will be described together.<br>
Transformer core 30 is composed of legs 35, 36 and 37. Frame 32 includes broad, thick ring<br>
32a and narrow, thin rings 32b and 32c. Frame 33 has broad, thick ring 33a, and narrow thin<br>
rings, 33b and 33c. Frame 34 includes broad, thick ring 34a, and narrow rings 34b and 34c.<br>
Figs 3a and 3g shows transformer core 30 in exploded form, and core 30 is shown in<br>
assembled form in figs, 3b and 3h, with a cross-section through each of the legs depicted. The<br>
cross-section of leg 35 is composed of rhomb 32a, rhomb 32b, rhomb 32c, rhomb 34a, rhomb<br>
34b and rhomb 34c. The cross section of leg 36 is made of rhomb 32a, rhomb 32b rhomb 32c,<br>
rhomb 33a, rhomb 33b and rhomb 33c. Finally, leg 37 has rhomb 33a, rhomb 33b, rhomb 33c,<br>
rhomb 34a, rhomb 34b and rhomb 34c. Each of the cross-section of legs 35, 36 and 37 is<br>
regular hexagons. The hexagon of leg 35 is defined by the bottom side and right edge of<br>
rhomb 32a, the right side edge of rhomb 32b and the right side edge of rhomb 32c (the last<br>
two edges are aligned to form one side of the hexagon), the edge of rhomb 32c and the<br>
aligned edge of 34c, the left edge of rhomb 34a and the lower edge of rhomb 34a. The<br>
hexagon of leg 36 is defined by the bottom side and right hand edge outside of rhomb 32a,<br>
the aligned right hand edges outside of rhombs 32c and 33c, the lower aligned edges of<br>
rhombs 33b and 33c, the lower edge of rhomb 33a and the left hand edge of rhomb 33a.<br>
Finally, the hexagon of leg 37 is defined by the upper right hand side and edge of rhomb 34a,<br>
the inner side of rhomb 33a, the bottom edge of rhomb 33a, the aligned bottom edges of<br>
rhombs 33b and 33c, the aligned left-hand of rhombs 34c and 34b, and the upper left hand<br>
edge of rhomb 34a.<br>
Turning next to figs. 3i-3k, ring 32a, which is identical to rings 33a and 34a, is shown in its<br>
front side and cut away views taken in the direction of arrows 3k-3k. Ring 32a includes<br>
opposite, parallel leg portions 305, 306, opposing yoke portions 307,308 and rounded corners<br>
309-312. The offset or splaying is shown in the profile 303.<br>
Narrow thin ring 32b, which is identical to 33b and 33c, is shown in figs, 31-n. fig 31 shows a<br>
front view of 32b, fig. 3m shows a side view of 32b and fig 3n shows a cross-sectional view<br>
taken in the direction of 3n-3n. Ring 32b has opposing, parallel legs 314, 315 and opposing<br>
yokes 316, 317. Ring 32b has rounded corners 318-321. Ring 32b is turned as it passes partly<br>
through broad thick ring 32a, and this is shown by the angle m in fig. 3n. The offsetting or<br>
splaying of the wound layers of 32b is shown at 323. It should be observed that the offset of<br>
the profile shown in figs. 3l-3n is in the opposite direction from that of ring 32a shown in figs.<br>
3i-3k.<br>
Front and side views of ring 32c (which is identical to rings 33c and 34c) are shown in figs.3o<br>
and 3p Fig 3q is taken in the direction of arrows 3q-3q in fig. 3o. Ring 32c has leg portions<br>
325, 327, which are opposing and parallel to each other. Parallel yoke portions 328, 329<br>
oppose each other Rounded corners 330-333 join the yokes and legs. The rings of transformer<br>
plate are offset or splayd are shown in figs. 30-3q at 335. It can be seen that the direction of<br>
the profile of offset portion 335 is to the right as viewed in fig. 3p, which is the same as the<br>
direction of the profile of ring 32b shown in fig. 3m. The turning is in the opposite direction<br>
reversed with respect to ring 326.<br>
The rhombic space outside of the basic rings described with reference to figs 2, 2a and 2b,<br>
could thus be filled in accordance with a couple of basic principles. The second embodiment<br>
was just described with reference to figs. 3 and 3a through 3q. In other words, the core,<br>
generally designated 30, has the same general shape as the first embodiment described<br>
above. However, in this embodiment the core comprises three identical frames 32-34, as<br>
explained above of which the rightmost one 32 will again be briefly described. The frames 32-<br>
34 are similar to the part 23 described in connection with fig. 2. Referring to figs. 3a and 3g in<br>
the first leg 35, the leg part of frame 32 comprises the board thick ring 32a and two narrow<br>
thin or bw rings 32b, 32c wherein ring 32c is wound outside of ring 32b, and the leg part of<br>
frame 34 with broad thick rings 34a, and side-by-side narrow thin rings 34b and 34c. In the<br>
second leg 36, the leg part of frame 32 has the broad thick ring 32a, and the two narrow thin<br>
rings 32b, 32c placed one beside the others. Leg 37 has the leg part of frame 33 with broad<br>
thick ring 33a, narrow thin rings 33b, 33c, and leg part of frame 31 with broad thick ring 34a<br>
and narrow thin rings 34b, 34c.<br>
The two other frames 33,34 are identical to the first one 32. Thus, the production of the core<br>
can as a rule can be simplified, depending on the production volume, because all three frames<br>
32-34 can be made from the same mould.<br>
A further possibility is to make broad thin rings and turn the leg parts 60Â°, forcing a<br>
corresponding bending of the yoke parts. The yoke parts then require more space and the<br>
bending is not so easy to effect. Making narrow thick rings and turning and bending as<br>
mentioned is also possible, but difficult. Additional variants, including those with smaller<br>
divisions, are also possible.<br>
A core with octagonal legs, generally designated 40, will now be described with reference to<br>
figs. 4 and 4a. In an octagonal cross-section, see e.g. the back leg 45, the sides turn 45<br>
degrees, which means that they have a relative angle of 135 degrees to each other. Three<br>
rhombs, each with an angle of 45 degrees, thus get space in the innermost edges of the legs<br>
of the core. Outside of these rhombs, two squares are filled by rings with quadratic cross-<br>
sections. Finally. A rhomb fills the rest of the octagonal cross-section of the leg.<br>
From these six cross-subsections, three subsections compose the cross-section of a profiled<br>
ring going to the second leg 46. The remaining subsections compose the cross-section of a<br>
profiled ring going to the third leg 47. There is also profiled ring connecting the second and<br>
third legs 46, 47.<br>
The three profiled rings all contain two rings with equal leg parts. A first ring 42a,43a, 44a has<br>
rhombic cross-section and the yoke Darts bent 15 degrees. A second ring 42b, 43b, 44b<br>
outside of the first ring is quadratic and follows the form of the first ring 42a-44a.<br>
Using a solution from the embodiments with hexagonal legs descrtoed with reference to figs. 2<br>
and 3, two outer rhombs compose the cross-section of an outer ring with the yoke parts bent<br>
15 degrees. Alternatively, two inner rhombs compose an inner ring but bent 60 degrees. The<br>
next ring must now give an outer rhomb in one leg and an inner rhomb in the other leg and<br>
be bent 30 degrees. One type of profiled ring is to be preferred because it is difficult to bend<br>
a ring 60 degrees and one can not avoid a ring with both an outer rhomb and an inner rhomb.<br>
In part 42, the third ring 42c has a rhombic cross-section in the leg parts and is<br>
placed outermost in the back leg 45 but inside the right leg 46. These rhombs of<br>
the leg parts are obtained by displacing the outer strips of the ring to the right at<br>
the right leg 46 and to the left at the back leg 45. Furthermore, the legs are<br>
turned asymmetrically 30 degrees and the yoke parts are bent accordingly. The<br>
ring is given such circumference that it will lie outside of the other rings.<br>
The final result appears in figure 4.<br>
A 10-sided leg. Generally designated 50, will now be described with reference to<br>
fig. 5. The profiled rings contain all four rings with equal leg parts. A first ring<br>
50a, a second ring 50b and a third ring 50c with rhombic cross-sections in their<br>
leg parts are attached to the 10-sided cross section. Thus they have the angles<br>
36, 72 and 108 degrees and their yoke parts bent 24 degrees. A fourth ring 50d<br>
having a rhomboid cross-section with the angle 36 degrees lies mainly upon the<br>
first ring 50a. Its leg parts are turned out-wards 24 degrees, causing a 48<br>
degrees bending of its yokes. The forth ring also causes the yoke parts of the<br>
third ring 50c to make a larger bow to give space. A fifth ring 50e has a rhombic<br>
cross-section in its leg parts with the angle 144 degrees when it lies outside of<br>
the third ring 50c, but the ring has a rhombic cross-section with the angle 72<br>
degrees when it lies outside of the fourth ring 50d. The yokes are bent only 12<br>
degrees. The arrows I the figure indicate that the cross-sections 50e belong to<br>
different profiled rings. There will also be a channel 51 suitable for cooling the<br>
legs. In an alternative embodiment, the channel is filled with a ring. This is an<br>
advantage when the rings co-operate by letting the magnetic filed go between<br>
them. The space can e.g. be disposed of in such a way that the upper part of the<br>
rings 50c obtains new rhombic cross-sections with the angle 72 degrees, causing<br>
the channels 52a and 52b to be formed. Further parts of ring 50c to the right can<br>
be pushed to ring 50e, which forms the spaces 53a and 53 b.<br>
It is possible to provide three-phase transformer cores with even more edges.<br>
Fig. 6 shows a 12-sided core, generally designated 60. The profiled rings are<br>
composed of four rings 60a-d with rhombic cross-sections with the angles 30,<br>
60, 90, and 120 degrees, which are attached<br>
to the 12-sided cross-section and are turned 15 degrees. Inside of these rings<br>
there are two rings 60e, 60f with rhombic cross-sections with the angles 30 and<br>
60 degrees, respectively, and turned outward 15 degrees. Attached to the fifth<br>
and sixth rings 60e, 60f there is space for a ring 60g with rhombic cross-section<br>
with the angle 30 degrees turned outward 45 degrees. Its other leg part is a<br>
rectangle outside of the sixth ring 601f and turned outward 15 degrees. Upon<br>
the ring 60d there is space for a ring 60h with a rhombic cross-section with the<br>
angle 150 degrees and the other leg part is a rectangle attached to ring 60d and<br>
outside ring 60f. The whole cross-section is then filled. Yoke parts are separated<br>
by giving some wider bows to give space for other yoke parts.<br>
The good properties of these transformer cores can be made even better for<br>
some transformer application, see fig. 7. The leakage, inductance can easily be<br>
increased by an additional core 29 of strips between the primary and secondary<br>
windings of the transformer. The strips are brought together at the top and<br>
bottom. The strips can be spread around the entire primary winding or be<br>
concentrated to one place, making the secondary winding eccentric.<br>
The non-linear magnetic properties of iron result in harmonics in the magnetic<br>
fields, voltages and currents.<br>
An additional leg placed in the center of the core will not get any magnetic field<br>
under perfectly symmetrical and distortion-free three-phase conditions. Common<br>
components in the phase voltages, like the third harmonics, will be influenced by<br>
a centre leg.<br>
Also a combination of strips between the windings and a centre leg is possible.<br>
In one embodiment, the centre leg is made of three rectangular poles 80 from<br>
strips given a height three times the width, laid on each other to a quadratic<br>
cross-section, see fig. 8. This is preferably triangular and a custom-made solution<br>
contains poles with a rhombic cross-section, of which three are put together to<br>
form a packet with the strip edges toward each other in a wave form, see fig. 9.<br>
Three packets are put together with small distances to form a leg with a.............<br>
cross-section approximating a triangle. The ends of the poles are bent outward<br>
to reach the yokes. To make the bends possible spacers between the poles are<br>
necessary. The spacers do not influence the magnetic properties because one<br>
pole from each packet 9ia-c; 92a-c; 93a-c is bent to each yoke. Also the strips<br>
are, at least on one side, parallel to the spacers. A rod, wound of strips in spiral<br>
form or as coils, is useful, especially if there are to be air gaps between the<br>
centre leg and the yokes. The spiral can be made wider at the ends to reduce<br>
the air gaps to the yokes.<br>
The flexibility of building cores like this good and is shown in fig. 10. The figure<br>
shows the core described in connection with fig. 4. A major part of the magnetic<br>
flux can pass from one profiled ring to another in the legs where they are<br>
touching each other. This enables the rotation of larger fluxes in the yoke<br>
triangle.<br>
With the present invention, it is also possible to provide a three-phase<br>
transformer core with lined up legs. This has the advantage that the transformer<br>
is narrower than with the delta shaped core. This type of transformer is ideal for<br>
placement on e.g. train wagons.<br>
Fig. 11a shows the transverse cross-section of a transformer with octagonal legs.<br>
All legs comprise four rhombs with an angle of 45 degrees and two squares.<br>
Rings running between adjacent legs are shown in the figure while those running<br>
between the outer legs are almost entirely hidden.<br>
In order to make transformer cores of this kind, the leg parts must be bendable<br>
and that the yoke parts can be bent and pass each other. There are several<br>
solutions, of which one is shown in the figure. The leg parts of the rings are bent<br>
outward and the yoke part inward or vice versa. The shape of the yoke parts is<br>
limited by the limited possibilities of plastic deformations but otherwise the yoke<br>
parts can have any shape. The principle shown in fig. 11 is to have sharp bends<br>
and straight yoke parts.<br>
The rings can also be placed on each other giving rounded bends in order to<br>
save material.<br>
The yokes between the left leg 115 and the center leg 116 are built up of a ring<br>
112a with a rhombic cross-section in the leg part, a ring 112b with a square<br>
cross-section and both bent 22.5 degrees and a rhombic ring 112c turned 67.5<br>
degrees in the leg parts. The rings 112a and 112b fit into the octahedrons close<br>
to the yoke side while the ring 112c fits into the opposing side.<br>
The yoke between the center leg 116 and the right leg 117 can only be placed in<br>
the center leg in the remaining positions: 114a-c. The cross-sections of the left<br>
and right legs 115, 117 are mirror images to the center leg 116 so that the rings<br>
running in the center leg are symmetric. The inner rings 114a, 114b have their<br>
closest positions in the right leg 117. However, the ring 114c with a square<br>
cross-section in the leg parts runs to the closest square-shaped position in the<br>
right leg. The reason behind that is that the ring 113a with a square cross-<br>
section between the outer legs is in an outer position on the yoke parts already<br>
present in order to reach the left leg.<br>
The turning of the yokes can be impossible to achieve. In an alternative<br>
embodiment, a heavily sloping fold is used instead. This is shown for the right<br>
114c having the shortest yoke. The fold starts at one end of the yoke and ends<br>
at the other end, marked by 118a for the lower yoke and 118b for the upper<br>
yoke in fig. 11. Also, the yokes can be subdivided into several narrow rings.<br>
Also single-phase transformers will be more efficient if they are given polygonal<br>
cross-sections. Fig. 12 shows a transformer with an octagonal cross-section<br>
composed of rings with the same cross-sections as in the three-phase<br>
transformers but with the return loops going the closest way outside of the<br>
windings. The rings can be transposed and yet given an octagonal cross-section.<br>
A small reduction of the amount of plate can e.g. be obtained by looping up to<br>
the left of the ring looping rightmost in the figure. There must its cross-section<br>
be changed to a rhombic form close to rectangular form.<br>
A core with two legs can be made from the three-phase designs by bending the<br>
rings from one leg together to form only one more leg. A core is shown in fig. 13<br>
with an octagonal<br>
cross-section in its legs. The turning of three leg-parts is 45 degrees and the<br>
bending is 90 degrees. A ring with a rectangular cross-section and the two rings<br>
outside of that ring are not deformed. Cores with hexagonal legs need only three<br>
rings made of strips with the same width.<br>
If that octagon edge where three rhomb edges meet, is put innermost in the<br>
core, the turnings will only be 22.5 degrees except for the rhomb in the middle,<br>
which must be turned 67.5 degree. Replacing this rhomb, is more realistic and is<br>
shown in fig. 14. A further improvement is made by letting the strips reach the<br>
circle, thus increasing the total cross-section.<br>
The segments outside of a polygonal leg can be filled by a thin rhombic ring of a<br>
strips with about half the width and the full height of the segment and wound to<br>
its total width. Folds in the strips along the middle of the rhomb as in fig. 15 two<br>
sides to one flat side giving a triangle, the sides of which are in contact with the<br>
core. With about 2/3 width and 8/9 height, a fold at the edge of the innermost<br>
strip makes a trapezoid cross-section as in fig. 16. The cross-section can also be<br>
rounded.<br>
By means of strips of constant width the leg parts can be given a cross-section<br>
shape closer to the shape of a circle, see figs. 17,17a and 17b. The right leg 172<br>
in fig. 17 will be described as an example with reference to fig. 17a, wherein a<br>
transverse cross-section of that leg is shown. Innermost, there are rings 173 of<br>
e.g. 80% of full width and to a height of 9% of its width. There are three rings<br>
reaching a circumscribed circle, see fig. 17a.<br>
Four of the six segments have been filed with magnetic material and strips<br>
outside of the assembled core can fill the other segments.<br>
A ring 174 can be placed on the outer sides of the hexagons.<br>
Another embodiment is shown in fig. 17b, wherein the ring 174 has been<br>
replaced by broader strips in the other rings.<br>
Some of the advantages of the inventive transformer core have already been<br>
mentioned. Among the other advantages can be mentioned: lower no load<br>
losses, less weight, less volume, lower electrical leakage, a reduction of<br>
harmonics due to the symmetry of the phases of the three-phase transformer,<br>
easy maintenance etc.<br>
