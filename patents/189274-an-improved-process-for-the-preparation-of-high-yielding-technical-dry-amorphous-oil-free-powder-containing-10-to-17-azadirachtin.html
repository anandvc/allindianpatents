				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to an improved Process for the preparation of high yielding technical dry amorphous powder containing 10 to 17% azadirachtin.<br>
More particularly this invention relate to the process for the preparation of technical dry amorphous powder free from oil in high yield.<br>
Several extraction methods have been adapted by the scientists in India and aboard to obtain azadirachtin in pure form and crude powder form. The following are the few important methods reported in the literature.<br>
1.	Nakanishi (1987) J. Nat. Products, 50 : 241-244;   wherein   2 kg seed<br>
kernels were defatted in hexane (oil 1050 ml was discarded), defatted marc was<br>
extracted in 95% ethanol. 185 g ethanol extract was partitioned with petroleum<br>
ether (oil 47 g discarded) and 95% methanol water. 138 g polar extracts was<br>
partitioned with water and ethyl acetate (water soluble proteins, subjected to<br>
vacuum  liquid chromatography.   13 g  azadirachtin  enriched fraction was<br>
crystallised from carbon tetrachloride. 8.5 g crude azadirachtin was subjected to<br>
flash chromatography to obtain 5 g 98% pure azadirachtin.<br>
The drawbacks are:<br>
1.	The process involves six steps, making it very tedious and time<br>
consuming<br>
2.	The procedure requires the use of five solvents. Some of the<br>
solvents are costly which enhances the total cost of the product.<br>
3.	Percentage of azadirachtin in crude powder is not reported.<br>
2.	Zanno et al. (1975), J. Am. Chem. Soc. 97 : (1975-1977); wherein<br>
Defatted marc was extracted with 95% ethanol, the extract was partitioned first<br>
with ethyl acetate/water and then methanol/water. Resultant polar mixture was twice chromatographed over silica gel eluting first with ether-acetone mixture followed by chloroform-ethyl acetate mixture. Crystallisation of crude powder and percentage of azadirachtin in crude is not reported. Preparative TLC was done to obtain pure azadirachtin (98%). The drawbacks are:<br>
1.	The procedure involves use of seven solvents which makes the<br>
procedure expensive.<br>
2.	The process involves eight steps making it very tedious.<br>
3.	The process include the use of silica gel chromatography making<br>
the process tedious.<br>
3. Butterworth and Morgan (1968), J.Chem. Soc. chem Comm. : 23-24; wherein 1 kg seeds were defatted with hexane, extracted with 95% ethanol and the extract was then partitioned between ethyl acetate and methanol: benzene. Residue obtain on the removal of ethyl acetate was partitioned between petroleum ether and 90% methanol. Petroleum layer was discarded and residue obtain on removal of methanol was subjected to silica gel chromatography followed by preparative TLC to obtain pure azadirachtin (98%). Crystallisation of crude powder and concentration of azadirachtin is not reported. The drawbacks are:<br>
1.	Two   time   partitioning   was   done   followed   by   silica   gel<br>
chromatography makes the procedure tedious.<br>
2.	The process involves the use of five solvent which makes method<br>
costly.<br>
3.       The process involves seven steps, makes the process lengthy.<br>
4.	Siddiqui et al. (1992), J. Nat. Products 55 : 303-310; wherein Fresh<br>
unruptured, ripe fruits of neem (10 kg) were repeatedly percolated with ethanol<br>
at room temperature. Removal of solvent from combined extract under reduced<br>
pressure gave a dark green residue, which was partitioned between ethyl<br>
acetate and water. The ethyl acetate layer was repeatedly extracted with 1%<br>
sodium hydroxide to separate the acidic impurities from the neutral constituents.<br>
The residue obtained, on removal of solvent from ethyl acetate layer was<br>
partitioned between 50% ethanol and petroleum ether (1:1). The upper layer<br>
was treated wit* charcoal and freed of solvent in vacuum. The residue thus<br>
obtained was divided into petroleum ether soluble and petroleum ether insoluble<br>
fraction. Petroleum ether insoluble fraction was subjected to preparative TLC to<br>
obtain azadirachtin along with naheedin. Crystallisation of crude mass was not<br>
attempted.<br>
The drawbacks are:<br>
1.	Six solvents have been used in the process making it costly.<br>
2.	The process involves eight steps which makes it lengthy and<br>
tedious.<br>
3.	Use of charcoal makes it cumbersome.<br>
4.	Crystallization of crude was not attempted.<br>
5.	Rengasamy et al. (1993), World Neem Conference, India, 1993; wherein<br>
Kernel powder (200 g) was soxhlet-extracted successively with hexane and<br>
ethanol by a modified method of Schroeder and Nakanishi (1987). Hexane<br>
extract on concentration yielded an oil. The ethanol layer on concentration yield<br>
a semi solid. It was dissolved in ethanol and analysed for azadirachtin content by HPLC.<br>
The ethanol concentrate was dissolved in ethanol and partitioned with hexane (6x50ml) to remove traces of oil. The ethanol fraction was suspended in water and extracted with ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate fraction was dried over sodium sulphate and concentrated. The concentrated mass was subjected to silica gel chromatography using 150 ml ethyl acetate for elution. The drawbacks are:<br>
1.	The process involves the use of four solvents making the method<br>
costly.<br>
2.	There are five steps in the method which makes it lengthy tedious.<br>
3.	Crystallization of crude was not attempted.<br>

Technical azadirachtin (10-25%) contains azadirachtin along with other meliacin compounds such as nimbin, salanin, nimbolide, nimbinene, deacetylsalianin, deacetylnimbine, epinimbine, deacetylnimbin. More than 50 neem base pesticide formulations containing azadirachtin have been developed in India and aboard (parmar and Ketkar, 1996) but only the following<br>
formulations have been registered under the Insecticides Act (1968) for the control of insects, pests of arhar, gram, cotton, brinjal, cabbage, jute, potato, tobacco etc. Besides, a number of entrepreneurs are coming up for registration of their neem based products for the control of pests.<br>

6.	RD-9 Replin : Oil base, containing 300 ppm azadirachtin.<br>
7.	Rakshak: Extract base, containing 1500 ppm azadirachtin<br>
There is a considerable emphasis on the development of neem pesticides base on "azadirachtin" which is the most widely evaluated neem compound. However, it may not be advisable to develop a product based on pure azadirachtin atone because of the following reasons :<br>
1.	There is hardly any evidence of the antagonistic effect of one neem<br>
compound on the other.  Literature survey reveals that under many<br>
situations, crude or semi-purified extracts of seeds give similar results as<br>
compared to pure azadirachtin and in fact, sometime, crude extracts;<br>
perform better than azadirachtin alone base preparations.<br>
2.	There is always a danger of development of resistance in insects against;<br>
a product containing a single active molecule.<br>
3.       Greater technical skills are required to produce very high concentrations of azadirachtin in technical grade material which also leads to marked escalation in cost. The main object of the present invention is to provide An improved<br>
method for the preparation of high yieding technical dry amorphous powder<br>
containing 10-17 % azadirachtin.   Which obviates the drawback as detailed<br>
above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to reduce the multiple steps. Still another object of the present invention is not to use water which effects the cone, at the end product<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to prepare dry powder in high yield wNch contains aza. in more than 10% cone, which has a long shelf life.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to eliminate the use of<br>
column<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of high yielding technical dry amorphous oil-free powder containing 10-17% azadiractin from Azadirachta indica seed kernel , which comprises grinding seed kernels of Azadirachta indica to fine powder , defatting the obtained powder using non-polar solvent, extracting the marc thus obtained by polar solvent, filtering and concentrating the filtrate by conventional methods , incorporating of molecular sieves of the kind as defined above to the concentrate filtrate , cooling at a temperature ranging from 0째 to 10 째 C for a period of 8 -12 hours , precipitating the said filtrate by adding non-polar solvent, filtering and drying the precipitate to obtain powder with yield ranging between 1.1-1.7 % by weight of seed karnel , the process is characterized in using simple steps and molecular sieves of mesh size ranging from 4 A째 to 5A째,<br>
to the said filtrate to obtain the precipitate followed by continuous stirring filtering and drying of powder with yield ranging between 1.1-1.7% by weight.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention wherein the defatting of the powder neem kernels is effected by using non-polar solvent such as petroleum ether, hexane, pentane, benzene and mixture thereof.<br>
In anotfier embodiment of the present invention wherein the extraction of the defatted marc is effected with polar solvent such as ethanol, methanoi, chloroform, ethylacetate, acetonitrile, acetone and mixture thereof.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention wherein the filtration and concentration is effected by the know methods like distillation, heating on a water bath, or rotary evaporator.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention is where in the incorporation of molecular sieves of mesh size ranging from 4Ao to 5Ao is effected by keeping it at temperature 0 to 10 for 8 to 12 hours.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention is wherein the precipitation is effected by non-polar solvent such as petroleum ether, hexane, pentane, benzene and mixture thereof.<br>
In stilt another embodiment of the present invention is wherein the yield of powder is ringing from 1.1 to 1.7 %.<br>
Details of the process<br>
500 gm seeds kernels were ground to fine powder and defatted by simple washing with hexane or by soxhlet till the complete removal of oil. Defatted mark was taken in container fitted with mechanical stirrer and chloroform was added<br>
such that 2" layer of the solvent remained above the solid mass (approx. 1 L or more solvent was required for the first extracting). Whole mass was stirred for 7-8 hrs. The mass was allowed to settled down and filtered using bochner funnel. The extraction was repeated two more times. Extraction was done in soxhiet also which prevents loss of solvent. Soxhiet extraction was done for 7-10 hrs. The combine filtrate was concentrated in a rotary evaporator to about 300 ml and molecular sieves mesh size ranging from 4A or 5A (2-3 gm) was incorporated in the solution the stopper of the flask replaced tightly and kept for several hrs. or overnight and precipitated by 60-80 petroleum ether or hexane. About 7gm crude powder was obtain by this method. Reported yield was 2.1 gm powder from 500 gm seed kernels.<br>
If the seed kernels are of pure quality than by this methodology crude powder obtain would contain more than 10 to 17% azadirachtin. It is therefore advisable to procure the best quality of neem seeds in order to obtain good percentage of azadirachtin in dry powder.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example 1.<br>
500 gm seeds kernels were ground to fine powder and defatted by simple washing with hexane or by soxhiet till the complete removal of oil. Defatted mark was taken in container fitted with mechanical stirrer and ethyte acetate was added such that 2 layer of the solvent remained above the solid mats (approx. 1<br>
L or more solvent was required for the first extracting). Whole mass was stirred for 7-8 hrs. The mass was allowed to settled down and filtered using bochner funnel. The extraction was repeated two more times. Extraction was done in soxhiet also which prevents loss of solvent. Soxhiet extraction was done for 7-10 hrs. The combine filtrate was concentrated in a rotary evaporator to about 300 ml and molecular sieves mesh size ranging from 4Ao or 5A&gt; was incorporated in the solution the stopper of the flask replaced tightly and kept for several hrs. or overnight and precipitated by 60-80 petroleum eflier or hexane. Crude powder (0.4 % yield) was obtain by this method.<br>
Example 2.<br>
500 gm seeds kernels were ground to fine powder and defatted by simple washing with hexane or by soxhiet till the complete removal of oil. Defatted mark was taken in container fitted with mechanical stirrer and acetonitrite was added such that 2 layer of the solvent remained above the solid mass (approx. 1 L or more solvent was required for the first extracting). Whole mass was stirred for 7-8 hrs. The mass was allowed to settled down and filtered using bochner funnel. The extraction was repeated two more times. Extraction was done in; soxhiet also which prevents loss of solvent. Soxhiet extraction was done for 7-10 hrs. The combine filtrate was concentrated in a rotary evaporator to about' 300 ml and molecular sieves mesh size ringing from 4Ao or 5Ao (2-3 gm) was? incorporated In the solution the stopper of the flask replaced tightly and kept for several hrs. or overnight and precipitated by 60-80 petroleum ether or hexane.Sticky mass was obtained. Which was triturated with hexane to get solid (0.41 % yield).<br>
Novelty &amp; Advantage : The novelty of the present invention over the priorart method reducing the multiple steps. Water has not been used as it affect the concentration and yield of the end product (dry powder). Molecular sieves removes moisture to give instant precipitation. Two solvent system has been used which are recycled with in the process. This process eliminate the use of column. This process give a crude powder in dry amorphous form in high yield (1.7 % yield by weight). Reported yield was 0.4%. Dry powder is completely free from oil and can be used directly in formulation as insecticides. Preparation of powder involves less steps column has not been used. Two solvents are used therefore it is cost effective powder in high yield and more stable (shelf life six months) than pure azadirechtin.<br><br><br><br><br>
