				<td>The invention relates to a process for<br>
automatically detecting horizontal black bands, for<br>
example for Implement ing automatic zoom for video<br>
images in the 4/3 format on 16/9 screens.<br>
Processes exist for automatically detecting so-<br>
called "letterbox" formats comprising black horizontal<br>
bars at the top and bottom of the. television image.<br>
These processes are generally based on a measurement of<br>
the video levels over the first few and last few lines<br>
of the video image. It is as a function of the<br>
luminance levels averaged over these first few lines<br>
and over these last few lines that the "letterbox"<br>
format is detected.<br>
These processes are however not very reliable<br>
since they depend on luminance settings, on the<br>
signal/noise ratio, on the insertion of logos into the<br>
black bands, etc.<br>
The purpose of the invention is to alleviate<br>
the aforesaid drawbacks.<br>
Its subject is a process for detecting black<br>
bands in a video image, characterized in thar, in a<br>
luminance range corresponding to low luminance values:<br>
- it calculates, per line, a value relating to<br>
a maximum number of occurrences, that is to say a<br>
maximum number of points haying the same luminance<br>
value, for lines situated in the usual location of a<br>
black band,<br>
- it averages this value over these lines,<br>
- it calculates a threshold dependent on this<br>
average,<br>
- it compares the value relating to a maximum<br>
number of occurrences obtained for a new line, with<br>
this threshold.<br>
According to a particular embodiment, the value<br>
relating to a maximum number of occurrences, for a<br>
line, is the maximum number of occurrences<br>
(Maxzone Principal i) of the points of the complete<br>
line or of a line portion.<br><br>
According to another embodiment, the value<br>
relating to a maximum number of occurrences, for a<br>
line, is the sum of the first, second and third <br>
greatest occurrences (Maxzong i) of the points of the<br>
complete line or of a line portion.<br>
According to other embodiments, the threshold<br>
is also dependent on the signal-to-noise ratio of the<br>
image. It can be a percentage of the average, this<br>
percentage possibly being dependent on the value of the<br>
average, over these lines, calculated for occurrences<br>
corresponding to the points of a complete line (Zl).<br>
According to a particular embodiment, the value<br>
relating to the maximum number of occurrences, for a<br>
line, is calculated for all the points of the line<br>
(Zl) .<br>
According to another embodiment, the image is<br>
split up into vertical zones (Z2, Z3, Z4), and the<br>
value relating to the number of occurrences, for a<br>
line, is calculated for only those points of the line<br>
portion corresponding to this zone. The comparison can<br>
be performed for various zones.<br>
According to a particular embodiment, the<br>
threshold relates to Maxzone_Principal i for a high<br>
signal-to-noise ratio and Maxzone i for a low signal-<br>
to-noise ratio.<br>
The comparison can be performed over several<br>
images and the detection can depend on a reliability<br>
criterion dependent on the number of identical<br>
detections for the various images. The reliability<br>
criterion can also be dependent on the number of<br>
identical detections for the various zones.<br>
The main advantage of the invention is reliable<br>
detection of the black bands and hence of the<br>
"letterbox" formats even if the information-carrying<br>
video, that is to say the video lines outside of the<br>
black bands, is much the same as the levels of the<br>
black. The displaying of a logo in a black band does<br>
not impede such detection owing to the fact that the<br>
detection can be performed for vertical zones so as to<br><br>
detect or eliminate the effects of the small insets<br>
present in the black bands.<br>
The characteristics and advantages of the<br>
invention will become better apparent from the<br>
following description given by way of example and with<br>
reference to the appended (figures accompanying in which:<br>
- Figure 1 represents an image in the letterbox<br>
format,<br>
- Figure 2a represents a histogram<br>
corresponding to a homogeneous black level,<br>
- Figure 2b represents a histogram<br>
corresponding to different levels of black,<br>
- Figure 3a represents an apportioning of the<br>
image into zones for the calculation of the histograms,<br>
- Figure 3b represents a histogram<br>
corresponding to zone 1,<br>
- Figure 3c represents a histogram<br>
corresponding to zones 2 to 4,<br>
- Figure 4a represents a histogram for which<br>
the threshold value taken into account is the maximum<br>
number of occurrences,<br>
- Figure 4b represents a histogram for which<br>
the threshold value taken into account relates to the<br>
sum of the first, second and third greatest<br>
occurrences.<br>
Figure la represents a video image in the 4/3<br>
format comprising an upper black band and a lower black<br>
band and displayed on a 16/9 screen. The right- and<br>
left-hand sides of the screen are filled in with<br>
Â¦ vertical black bars. In an exemplary use of the<br>
process, an automatic zoom is triggered by the<br>
detection of the horizontal bars so as to display a<br>
full-screen image.<br>
The detection of the black bands amounts in<br>
fact to determining in the image the first and the last<br>
line of information-carrying video which will<br>
subsequently be referred to as the "active" video. The<br>
first line of the "active" video, in Figure 1, is<br>
referenced 1 and the last line is referenced 2.<br>
- 4 -<br>
The principle of the algorithm implemented<br>
within the invention relies on the comparing of a value<br>
corresponding to the maximum number of pixels having<br>
the same luminance value in the low levels, over a<br>
video line, with a threshold dependent on the quality<br>
of the image to be processed.<br>
A criterion defining the quality of the image<br>
is therefore evaluated as a function of the noise level<br>
within the image and also depending on the<br>
apportionment per line of the video points over a<br>
luminance histogram for the low levels, for example<br>
those below 63. The "purer" the black, the larger the<br>
value of the maximum of the histogram will be.<br>
Figure 2a represents a histogram corresponding<br>
to horizontal black bands having a homogeneous black<br>
level.<br>
The labelling used for the histogram<br>
corresponds, for the ordinate axis, to the number of<br>
occurrences, that is to say to the number of samples<br>
and for the abscissa axis, to the luminance values. In<br>
the case considered, the 720 samples corresponding to a<br>
video line have the same luminance value.<br>
The histograms are described hereinbelow, with<br>
the same labelling.<br>
Figure 2b represents a histogram corresponding<br>
to different levels of black.<br>
The most frequent luminance level, in the <br>
example illustrated, appears for 160 samples out of the ;<br>
720 samples of a line. This is the first maximum peak<br>
over a line of samples.<br>
For reliability of detection reasons, and so as<br>
to take account of insets or logos displayed or of any<br>
type of display in zones defined in the black bands,<br>
the characterization of the image is carried out over<br>
several zones, in our example over four zones.<br>
Figure 3a represents such zones:<br>
- a first zone Zl corresponding to the width of<br>
a line of the image in the 4/3 format, i.e. 720 points,<br>
- a second, third and fourth zone Z2, Z3, Z4<br>
corresponding to the first third, to the second third<br>
and to the third third of a video line, i.e. 240 points<br>
for each zone.<br>
Figure 3b represents a histogram corresponding<br>
to zone 1. The values Pmax, Dmax and Tmax are<br>
respectively the first, second and third maxima<br>
relating to the number of samples per luminance value.<br>
They therefore correspond to the three values of low<br>
luminance, below 63 in our example, which are most<br>
commonly encountered in a line. <br>
The characteristic values chosen for zone 1<br>
are, for each line, the maximum number of identical<br>
luminance values Pmax and the sum of the values Pmax,<br>
Dmax and Tmax. <br>
Figure 3c represents a histogram corresponding<br>
to zone 2, 3 or 4. For these zones, the characteristic <br>
value chosen is the value Pmaxi. This is therefore the<br>
maximum occurrence for the line portion corresponding<br>
to zone i.<br>
The various characteristic values are extracted<br>
per video line and therefore yield histograms<br>
corresponding to 720 samples for zone 1 and 240 samples<br>
for each of the other zones.<br>
The quality criteria chosen correspond to the<br>
average values of these measured characteristic values,<br>
for an image or a frame, over a part of the image<br>
situated in the usual location of a black band of the<br>
image.<br>
This is for example an average over the first n<br>
video lines displayed. In a particular example, n = 16.<br>
By way of comparison, a black band corresponds to<br>
several tens of video lines.<br>
In what follows, the generic term image will be<br>
used to designate both an image and an frame.<br>
One therefore has the following five quality<br>
criteria:<br>
- Noise level calculated in a known manner for<br>
an image or a set of images or else precalculated, for<br>
example if the image transmission conditions do not<br>
influence its value.<br>
- Average value, over the set of n lines of<br>
each of the zones i, of the value Pmaxi, this giving<br>
four values called Maxzone_Principali for the four zones<br>
i.<br>
- Average value, over the set of n lines of<br>
each of the zones i, of the sum Pmax + Dmax + Tmax,<br>
this giving four values called Maxzonei for the four<br>
zones i.<br>
These quality criteria, which therefore relate<br>
to the purity of the black, are evaluated for an image.<br>
Thresholds are then defined for each of these<br>
criteria for detecting the black bands. It is the<br>
values of the quality criteria which are obtained for<br>
the first n lines of the image which are utilized for<br>
calculating the thresholds and for detecting the<br>
"active" video in the subsequent lines.<br>
The threshold values calculated depend on the<br>
signal-to-noise ratio.<br>
For a noise-free image (signal-to-noise ratio<br>
S/B &gt; 30 dB) , a first test is performed on the value<br>
Maxzonei.<br>
If this value is greater than 480 evidencing<br>
good purity of the black, the threshold chosen for zone <br>
i (Val Purei) is the value Maxzone Principali lowered <br>
by a margin of the order of 12%. Figure 4a shows such <br>
an example.<br>
If this value is less than or equal to 480, the<br>
threshold value chosen for zone i (Val_Thresholdi) is<br>
the value Maxzonei, lowered by a margin of 25% if<br>
Maxzone_Principal1 is less than or equal to 240 or else<br>
lowered by a margin of 18% if Maxzone_Principal1 is<br>
greater than 240 and therefore corresponds to a greater<br>
purity of black. Figure 4b shows an example where the<br>
threshold is calculated with respect to Maxzonei.<br>
The better the quality of the image, the <br>
smaller the margins.<br><br>
Minimum threshold values are imposed, 270 for<br>
zone 1 and 270/3 for the other zones, when the<br>
calculated threshold values are lower than these floor<br>
values.<br>
The above exemplary algorithm is repeated<br>
hereinbelow, supplemented for the other values of<br>
signal-to-noise ratio (slightly noisy image and very<br>
noisy image). It will be observed that, in the case of<br>
a very noisy image, the floor threshold values are<br>
higher so as to maintain good reliability in the<br>
detections.<br>
1) Signal/Noise &gt; 30 dB<br>
if (Maxzone1 &gt; 480), then the threshold value is:<br>
Val_Purei = Maxzone_Principali - Maxzone_Principali/8 (-12%)<br>
or else if (Maxzone1 
and if (Maxzone_Principal1 
Val_Thresholdi = Maxzonei - Maxzonei/4 (-25%)<br>
unless (Val_threshold1 
unless (Val_threshold2-3-4 
or else, if (Maxzone_Principal1 &gt; 240), then:<br>
Val__Thresholdi = Maxzonei - Maxzonei/8 - Maxzonei/16 (-18%)<br>
unless (Val_threshold1 
unless (Val_threshold2-3-4 
2) 25 dB 
if (Maxzone1 &gt; 480), then:<br>
Val_Thresholdi = Maxzonei - Maxzonei/16 (-6%)<br>
or else, if (Maxzone1 
Val_Thresholdi = Maxzonei - Maxzonei/8 - Maxzonei/16 (-18%)<br>
unless (Val_threshold1 
unless (Val_threshold2-3-4 
3) Signal/Noise 
Val_Thresholdi = Maxzonei - Maxzonei/16 (-6%)<br>
unless (Val_threshold1 &gt; 480), then Val_Threshold1 =480<br>
unless (Val_threshold2-3-4 &gt; 160), then Val_Threshold2-3-4 = 160<br>
Thus, according to the value of the average,<br>
over the first n lines, of the sum of the first three<br>
maxima of the histogram, Maxzonei, and of the value of<br>
the noise, the detection is carried out, for each<br>
subsequent line j, either by comparing the sum of the<br>
first three maxima per line for this line j<br>
(Pmaxi+Dmaxi+TmaXi) linej with the associated threshold<br>
(Val_thresholdi) , or by comparing the value of the first<br>
maximum for this line j (Pmaxi)linej with the associated<br>
threshold (Val_purei) .<br>
For an image rated as "pure", the useful<br>
information is contained in the value of Pmaxi. The<br>
detection with regard to this single value is more<br>
accurate.<br>
These comparisons are made for each of the<br>
zones and hence by taking the values of the maxima for<br>
each part of line j corresponding to a zone.<br>
The altering of the threshold value as a<br>
function of the purity of the black makes it possible<br>
to be more accurate in the detection. If the image is<br>
found to be only slightly noisy, homogeneous, during<br>
the measurements over the first few lines, the<br>
calculated threshold can be closer to the corresponding<br>
calculated average value (that is to say have a small<br>
margin). These threshold adjustments, when the quality<br>
of the image is declared to be good, allow the<br>
detection of insets, logos, etc even if they affect<br>
only a very small zone of the image.<br>
The following criteria can be used to confirm<br>
or define a line to be "active" video.<br>
- The part of the image in which the line or<br>
lines detected as "active video" are situated, for<br>
example the first third and the last third of the<br>
image. For an image of 28 8 lines, the detection<br>
confirmation zone may be situated for example between<br>
line 16 and line 288/3 for the upper part of the image<br>
and line 288 x 2/3 and 288 - 16 for the lower part.<br>
- The number of identical detections over each<br>
of the four zones of the same frame.<br>
- The number of samples and the position of the<br>
first maximum. (The confidence level is dependent on<br>
the magnitude of the peak and on the value of the<br>
black) .<br>
A time criterion can be added. The 4 values<br>
detected, corresponding to the 4 zones, plus the value<br>
chosen, are stored in memory for each frame, over p<br>
frames. A zonewise majority procedure is then performed<br>
so as to determine, per zone, the "top" line<br>
corresponding to the first line of the image and the<br>
"bottom" line corresponding to the last line of the<br>
information-carrying image.<br>
The presence of a logo in a zone can thus be<br>
detected with great reliability.<br>
A higher weighting is given to the spatial or<br>
temporal criterion depending on the type of detection<br>
desired, that is to say depending on whether one wishes<br>
to ignore the logo or not, preserve the black bands or<br>
not in the presence of a logo, etc.<br>
