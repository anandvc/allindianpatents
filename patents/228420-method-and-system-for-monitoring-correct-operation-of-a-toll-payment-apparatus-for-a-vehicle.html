				<td>The invention relates to a method for monitoring the<br>
correct operation of a toll payment apparatus for a<br>
vehicle with a vehicle identification.<br>
The invention also relates to a monitoring system for<br>
monitoring the correct operation of a toll payment<br>
apparatus for a vehicle identification.<br>
In automatic toll systems, a license number<br>
identification which is based on optical pattern<br>
recognition or "Optical Character Recognition" OCR for<br>
short, is frequently used in the course: of monitoring<br>
correct payment of the toll fees and for identification<br>
of toll infringes, with a high probability of<br>
identification normally being required. The performance<br>
of OCR is highly dependent on the environmental<br>
conditions (weather), and requires either a high degree<br>
of local computation power or a large amount of data to<br>
a central OCR host.<br>
In some toll systems, the toll fees are paid<br>
continuously by communication with the toll<br>
infrastructure or via devices which are similar to<br>
repayment cards. In the first case, the identify of the<br>
vehicle is not known in the latter. In both cases,<br>
however, correct payment of the toll foes must be<br>
monitored, and potential toll infringes must be<br>
identified.<br>
One system o f the type mentioned initially is<br>
described, for example, in WO 99/66455. In this case,<br>
an apparatus for monitoring the correct operation of a<br>
toll payment apparatus is arranged at the side of the<br>
road, with the Loll payment apparatus being arranged in<br><br>
a vehicle that is passing the apparatus and has a<br>
license plate, and with communication taking place<br>
between the toil appliance and the apparatus. If, on<br>
the basis of the communication with the toll payment<br>
apparatus, the apparatus identifies that the toll<br>
payment apparatus is not being operated correctly, then<br>
the license plate of the vehicle is recorded by moans<br>
of a recording device.<br>
However, this apparatus has the disadvantage that a<br>
communication link must be set up between the toll<br>
appliance and the apparatus, for which reason the<br>
production of this apparatus is associated with high<br>
costs.<br><br>
One object of the invention is thus to provide a means<br>
which allows toll infringes to be identified and<br>
correct operation of the toll payment device to be<br>
identified in a simple and cost-effective manner.<br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved by<br>
a method of the type mentioned initially in that at<br>
least one optical pattern/signal, which is<br>
characteristic of the operating state of the toll<br>
payment apparatus and can be predetermined, is produced<br>
in the area of the front of the vehicle.<br>
In one advantageous variant of the invention, the<br>
optical pattern/signal which can be predetermined is<br>
produced by moans of at least one light-emitting diode.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the<br>
optical pattern/signal is an infrared pattern/signal<br>
with the light-emitting diode being an infrared light-<br>
emtting diode .<br>
Further advantages can bo achieved by the optical<br>
pattern/siqnal being detected by means of an optically<br>
sensitive sensor.<br>
Furthormore, the optical pattern/signal can be detected<br>
by means of an infrared camera.<br>
In order to produce a pattern/signal which corresponds<br>
to incorrect operation of the toll payment apparatus,<br>
the license number of the vehicle can be recorded as it<br>
passes a monitoring point.<br>
An apparatus of the type mentioned initially which is<br>
designed to produce at least one optical pattern/signal<br>
which is characteristic of the operating state of the<br>
toll payment apparatus and can be predetermined, in the<br>
area of the front of the vehicle is particularly<br><br>
suitable for carrying out the method according to the<br>
invention.<br>
At least one light-emitting diode is advantageously<br>
provided in order to produce the optical pattern/signal<br>
which can be predetermined.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the<br>
apparatus is designed to produce an infrared<br>
pattern/signal, in which case an infrared lignt-<br>
emitting diode may be provided in order to produce the<br>
infrared pattern/signal .<br><br>
The monitoring system is advantageously designed to<br>
detect the optical pattern/signal by means of an<br>
optically sensitive sensor.<br>
Furthermore, the monitoring system may be designed to<br>
detect the optical pattern/signal by means of an<br>
infrared camera.<br>
Further advantages can be achieved by the monitoring<br>
system being designed to record the License number of<br>
the vehicle as it passes a monitoring point, in order<br>
to produce a pattern/signal which corresponds to<br>
incorrect operation of the toll payment apparatus.<br>
The invention together with further advantages wiJ i be<br>
explained in more detail in the following text with<br>
reference to a number of exemplary embodiments, which<br>
do not restrict the scope of the invention and are<br>
illustrated in the drawing, in which, illusfrated<br>
schematically:<br>
Figure 1 shows a system for recording and payment of<br>
toll fees by means of a	toll payment apparatus, which<br>
is arranged on board the	vehicle, for determination of<br>
the toll fees;<br>
Figure la shows the toll payment apparatus as shown in<br>
Figure 1, in more detail;<br>
Figure 2 shows the toil payment apparatus as shown in<br>
Figure 1 in more detail, and a reader for booking a<br>
user authorization to the toll payment apparatus;<br>
Figure 3 shows a magnetic card with a code for booking<br>
a user authorization to the toll payment apparatus;<br><br>
Figure 4 shows a toll system with a vehicle -exlernal<br>
billing center in addition to the toll payment<br>
apparatus within the vehicle;<br>
Figure 5 shows a monitoring system according to the<br>
invontion, and<br>
Figure 6 shows a display for enforcement indication,<br>
which is arranged in the front windshieLd of a vehicle.<br>
As is illustrated in Figure 1, a toll system SYS may<br>
have a position finding system PSE, for example the<br>
known "Global Positioning System" or GPS system for<br>
short, in order to locate the position of a vehicle<br>
FAR.<br><br>
in this case, the vehicles, FA1, FA2 may have the toll<br>
payment, apparatuses BE1, BE2 which are designed to<br>
receive data from the position finding system PSE and<br>
to use this to calculate the position coordinates 0K0<br>
of the vehicles, FA1, FA2 . The route STR which has been<br>
traveled can be determined on the basis of the position<br>
coordinates OKO, for example on the basis of a<br>
signature SIG which is calculated from the position<br>
coordinates OKO. Furthermore, if the route STR on which<br>
a vehicle FA1 , FA2 i.s driving is subject to a Ttoll, a<br>
check can be carried out to determine whether the<br>
vehicle FA1, FA2 is authorized to use the route that is<br>
subject to a toll<br>
The usage authorization BER may, for example, be in the<br>
form of a credit GUT and be stored in a memory SPR for<br>
the toll payment apparatus BF1 , in which case this toll<br>
payment apparatus BE1 may be designed to calculate the<br>
toll fees GEB which are incurred, and to debit them<br>
from the credit GUT. If the credit GUT has been<br>
consumed and there is no further usage authorization<br>
BFR, then the vehicle FAR can no longer use routes STR<br>
which arc subject to toils. The toll payment apparatus<br>
BE1 , with a usage authorization BER stored in it, is<br>
referred to in the following text as a prepayment card<br>
WER.<br>
The usage authorization BFR need not necessarily be a<br>
credit GUT. The usage authorization BER may, for<br>
example, also be in the form of a time card ZE1, which<br>
is stored in the memory SPR of the prepayment card WER<br>
and which authorizes the use of routes STR which are<br>
subject, to tolls and can be predetermined within a<br>
certain time period, etc. (Figure 2).<br>
The type of usage authorization BER which is desired by<br>
a vehicle keeper (credit, time card, route credit,<br>
timings etc) may, for example be transferred to the<br><br>
toll payment apparatus BEV as a code COD. Any type of<br>
usaqe authorization BKR may in this case be assigned a<br>
code CO1, CO2, C03, which can be predetermined, in a<br>
memory unit SP1 for the toll payment apparatus BEV<br>
(Figure 2) . If is thus possible, for example to<br>
allocate a first code C01 to a time card ZE1 for all<br>
the routes STR that are subject to tolls in a reqion<br>
which can be predetermined, while another code CO2<br>
charges a credit GUT by an amount which can be<br>
predetermined, or a third code C03 increases a route<br>
credit SGH by an amount which can be predetermined,<br>
etc.<br>
After receiving the code COD, the controller STE for<br>
the toll payment apparatus BEV can identify and enab.lc<br>
or activate the appropriate usage authorization BKR by<br>
comparison of the code COD that has been obtained by<br>
the user with the codes CO1, CO2, CO3 which are stored<br>
in the memory unit SP1.<br><br>
The code COD may be transmitted, for example, by means<br>
of an input apparatus EIV which is connected to the<br>
prepayment card WEK by cable or without the use of<br>
cables. Examples of a cable-based connection between<br>
the input apparatus ETV and the toll payment apparatus<br>
BEV include copper wire, glass fiber, etc. Examples of<br>
a connection without the use of cables are radio,<br>
infrared transmission, laser, etc.<br>
In order to prevent the prepayment card WEK from being<br>
loaded with a usage authorization BER by misuse, the<br>
code CO1, CO2, CO3 may be scrambled and may be<br>
transmitted to the prepayment card WEK in a form which<br>
cannot be identified by the user.<br>
for example, the code COD may be stored in a mobile<br>
data storage medium. In this case, the input apparatus<br>
EIV is in the form of a reader LES for mobile data<br>
storage media, in order to transmit the user<br>
authorization BER or the code COD to the toll payment<br>
apparatus. In order to prevent the mobile data storage<br>
medium from being reused as a form of misuse, the<br>
leader LES may be designed to end the transmission<br>
process of the code COD to the to.l 1 payment apparatus<br>
BEV with a cancellation of the mobile data storage<br>
medium. This cancellation may, for example, comprise<br>
the information which is contained in the mobile data<br>
storage medium being erased by the reader, or a value<br>
WER which indicates the validity of the mobile data<br>
storage medium being set from "valid" to "invald"<br>
(Figure 3 ) .<br>
As is shown in Figure 4, a communication link can also<br>
be set up between the toll payment apparatus BE2 and a<br>
billing center ABZ, in which case the user<br>
authorization BER may be provided in the billing<br>
center, preferably in the form of an account KON which<br><br>
Is associated with the vehicle and from which toll fees<br>
GEB which are incurred can be debited.<br>
in the following text, the toll payment apparatus BE2<br>
which can interchange data with the billing center ABZ,<br>
is referred to as a calculation unit OBU.<br>
As is shown in Figure 5, a monitoring system UES<br>
according to the invention for monitoring the correct<br>
operation of a toll payment apparatus BEV has a<br>
conroller ST1 as well as a display DIP which is<br>
connected to it and is designed to display a pattern<br>
MUS which can be predetermined (Figure 6) . The optical<br>
patttern MUS depends on the current operating state of<br>
the toll payment apparatus BE1 , BF2, for example<br>
whether there is a valid usage authorization BER or<br>
whether the toll payment apparatus BE1,BE2 is switched<br>
on .<br><br>
In order to display the pattern MUS as a function of<br>
the operating state of the toll payment apparatus BE1 ,<br>
BE?, the controller STl can monitor the status of the<br>
usage authorization BER in the prepayment card WEK and<br>
in the billinq center ABZ, and can monitor whether the<br>
toll payment apparatus BE1, BE2 is switched on or off.<br>
The control lor ST1 controls the display DIP as a<br>
function of the operating state of the toll payment<br>
apparatus BEl, BE2, with a pattern MUS which<br>
corresponds to the current operating state being<br>
displayed on this display DIP. The display DIP may have<br>
light-emitting diodes LED or infrared light-emitting<br>
diodes in order to display the pattern MUS.<br>
If the usage authorization BER is stored in the billing<br>
center ABZ, then the calculation unit OBU may be<br>
designed to check the status of the usage authorization<br>
BER at time intervals which can be predetermined, via a<br>
radio network FUN, for example the GSM network, and to<br>
store this.<br>
If no valid user authorization BER exists for the<br>
calculation unit. OBU, then an optical pattern MUS which<br>
is provided for this purpose is displayed on the front<br>
of the vehicle FRO.<br>
Impermissible manipulations of the prepayment card WEK<br>
or of the calculation unit OBU by the driver can be<br>
identified by the controller ST1 for the monitoring<br>
system UES which is associated with the corresponding<br>
vehicle FA1 ,FA2 . For example, the controller ST1 for<br>
the monitoring system may be designed to display a<br>
pattern MUS, which is provided for this purpose, on the<br>
display, for examp1e an illuminated light-emitting<br>
diode LED, i f a false code COD for a user authorization<br>
MED is entered in the prepayment card WEK more than<br>
once .<br><br>
If the user authorization BER is stored in the<br>
prepayment card WEK, that is to say if no link is<br>
provided between the toll payment apparatus BEV and a<br>
billing center ABZ for a toll operator, the inputting<br>
of the entry or exit to or from a route STR which is<br>
subject to a toll, that is to say the activation of the<br>
toll payment apparatus BEV, can be carried out by the<br>
driver of the vehicle FAR by means of a suitable input<br>
apparatus, for example a button on the prepayment card<br>
WEK.<br>
This allows the vehicle driver to have the obligation<br>
to carry out an action in a similar way to the<br>
cancellation of a tram ticket.<br><br>
If the prepayment card WEK has been switched on by the<br>
vehicle user and a valid usage authorization BFR<br>
exists, then the controller ST1 produces a<br>
corresponding optical pattern MUS on the display DIP,<br>
for example two illuminated light-emitting diodes LFD,<br>
while, if the prepayment card WEK is in the switched-<br>
off state, a pattern MUS which characterizes this state<br>
is produced, for example with none of the light-<br>
omitting d i odes LED emitti ng light.<br>
The pattern MUS is thus used to indicate whether the<br>
driver of the vehicle FAR is a potential or actual toll<br>
infringement.<br>
For evidential purposes, the route positions or the<br>
signature SIG for the route STR and any information<br>
relating to the usage time, for example in the form of<br>
a time stub STE that is attached to the currently<br>
determined signature SIG, may be stored in a memory SP3<br>
for the prepayment card WEK or for the billing center<br>
AHZ, and may be made available as required. This<br>
procedure makes it possibJe to avoid online<br>
communication between the toll payment apparatus and<br>
the billing center.<br>
In order to prevent manipulation by the driver,<br>
lacunal cither after a cycle which is stored in the<br>
prepayment card WEK or in the calculation unit OBU. In<br>
the case of the calculation unit OHU with a<br>
communication capability, the pattern may also be<br>
changed externally, for example via a GSM broadcast<br>
request .<br>
The pattern change when using a calculation unit OBU<br>
tgat is capable of communication can also be initiafed<br>
on a region-despondent basis, or can be initiated via<br>
the broadcast functionality of the mobile radio network<br>
by changing to a different mobile radio cell.<br><br>
This means that the valid pattern which corresponds to<br>
a permissible operating state is not fixed, but can<br>
also be initiated, for example, on the basis of a time<br>
pattern, on a position-dependent basis, or by external<br>
events such as the ce 1-1 broadcast. This makes it<br>
possible to prevent qoods vehicle drivers from driving<br>
around with dummy LEDs and becoming familiar with the<br>
pattern to be set.<br>
When driving through a fixed monitoring station KST,<br>
this pattern can now be evaluated and can be used as a<br>
trigger signal for a license plate OCR. In addition to<br>
the low costs, the advantage of this solution is that<br>
it is not necessary to supply each vehicle with a<br>
license plate OCR.<br><br><br>
The optical pattern is advantageously displayed as an<br>
infrared pattern. Infrared patterns can be identified<br>
by low-cost interference filters on an infrared camera<br>
KAM, with a correspondingly high light power Level from<br>
the LEDs and with a very much higher signal - to-noise<br>
ratio than license plates with a purely passive license<br>
plate OCR. It is Likewise possible to identify a number<br>
of simple patterns, much more reliabiy.<br>
The monitoring system UES according to the invention is<br>
not used for communication, as in the case of WO<br>
99/66455 that was mentioned initial 1 y, but is used to<br>
reduce the frequency of the license plates OCRs which<br>
are more complex and are considerably less reliable in<br>
the environmental conditions that are to be expected.<br>
The amount of data traffic between the fixed-position<br>
enforcement stations and the OCR control center is thus<br>
considerably reduced when the OCR is carried out<br>
contrally.<br>
Mobile monitoring can likewise be carried out using an<br>
infrared camera. In addition to this, a preselection<br>
process can also be carried out via additional LED<br>
sources in the visible band. However, signaling may<br>
also in general fake place in the visible band.<br>
Throe typos of vehicles FAR may enter the booking<br>
region :<br>
 1 . Vehicles FAR without or with an invalid<br>
(manipulated) IR/LED signature; there are either<br>
toll infringers, as are in principle possible with<br>
any given automatic toll methods or with toll<br>
participants with defective toll payment<br>
apparatuses BEV, or without or with invalid usage<br>
authorizations BER, for example a blocked account<br>
KON or consumed credit. GUT. All of these<br>
participants can be identified in appropriate<br><br>
monitoring stations (fixed or mobile) and can be<br>
dealt with in accordance with Lhe defined rules.<br>
Vehicles with a valid IR/LED signature, with the<br>
leaving of a state region being identified and,<br>
for example, the communication of the toLl payment<br>
apparatus BER with the billing center ABZ together<br>
with the toll payment process being deactivated,<br>
and only position finding now being carried out,<br>
or being switched to the toll system, whoso basis<br>
technology is compatible, of a neighboring state<br>
or country.<br>
Since the current position of the vehicle is known<br>
in the calculation unit BEE in the vehicle, and it<br>
is possible to use this to identify which<br>
coordinate point is located on this side or beyond<br>
the border, Lhe current pattern can be activated<br>
in good time even before crossing a border on a<br>
route which is subject to a toll.<br><br>
A tolrance zone is advantageously provided around the<br>
border, in which activation of the calculation unit is<br>
not absolutely essential.If a journey continues in a<br>
state region on a roadway that is subject to a toll,<br>
then the toll payment is made in accordance with the<br>
method according to the invention.<br>
In summary, it can be stated that the invention allows<br>
monitoring of the correct operation of toll payment<br>
apparatuses to be ensured in a simple manner.<br><br><br>
