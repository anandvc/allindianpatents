				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a catalyst composition, methods for the polymerization and copolymerization of olefins, polyolefins, and film and pipe resins formed therefrom, particularly using a supported catalyst composition. The present invention also relates to the fields of organic synthesis and organometallic synthesis, including synthetic methods for half-metallocenes.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Presently, a variety of polyethylene (PE) resins can be used to produce high stiffness pipe used in water, gas, and other fluid transport applications. Polyethylene pipe classified as PE-100, MRS 10, or ASTM D3350 typical cell classification 345566C is especially desirable for use under conditions requiring higher pressure ratings. To obtain a PE-100 classification, PE-100 pipe is required to meet certain standards specifying stiffness, resistance to slow crack growth, resistance to chemical attack, and low-temperature toughness (expressed as rapid crack propagation). Further, such pipe must meet a deformation standard that is determined under pressure at elevated temperatures. It is also desirable for PE-100 pipe to exhibit toughness, for example, where the pipe is buried underground or where the pipe is used to transport coarse or abrasive slurries. Accordingly, there is a need for a resin and a PE-100 pipe made therefrom that has improved physical properties and impact resistance properties.<br>
With conventional processes and resins formed using metallocene catalyst systems, there is a trade off between high stiffness and high environmental stress cracking resistance (ESCR). While either high stiffness or high ESCR items can be manufactured, conventional processes do not produce items having both high stiffness and high ESCR.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to a catalyst composition including two metallocene compounds, an activator, and a cocatalyst. The present invention further relates to processes for producing such a catalyst composition, polymerization processes, and polymers produced therefrom. The metallocene compounds are combined with an activator, an aluminum alkyl compound, and olefin monomers to produce a polyolefin having a bimodal molecular weight distribution. The resulting polymers feature an outstanding balance of stiffness and slow crack growth resistance. Additionally, the polymers produced according to the present invention have excellent impact strength.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the two metallocene compounds are selected such that the polymers produced therefrom have two distinctly different molecular weights. One of the metallocenes, typically a tightly bridged metallocene containing a substituent that includes a terminal olefin, produces a high molecular weight component. Another metallocene, which typically is not bridged and often is more responsive to hydrogen than the first metallocene, produces a low molecular weight component of the resin.<br>

DEFINITIONS<br>
To define more clearly the terms used herein, the following definitions are provided. To the extent that any definition or usage provided by any document incorporated herein by reference conflicts with the definition or usage provided herein, the definition or usage provided herein controls.<br>
The term "polymer" is used herein to mean homopolymers comprising ethylene and copolymers of ethylene and another olefinic comonomer. "Polymer" is also used herein to mean homopolymers and copolymers of any other polymerizable monomer disclosed herein.<br>
The term "cocatalyst" is used generally herein to refer to the organoaluminum compounds that may constitute one component of the catalyst composition. Additionally, "cocatalyst" refers to the optional components of the catalyst composition including, but not limited to, aluminoxanes, organoboron compounds, organozinc compounds, or ionizing ionic compounds, as disclosed herein. The term "cocatalyst" may be used regardless of the actual function of the compound or any chemical mechanism by which the compound may operate. In oneaspect of this invention, the term "cocatalyst" is used to distinguish that component of the catalyst composition from the metallocene compound.<br>
The term "fluoroorgano boron compound" is used herein with its ordinary meaning to refer to neutral compounds of the form BYs. The term "fluoroorgano borate compound" also has its usual meaning to refer to the monoanionic salts of a fluoroorgano boron compound of the form [cation]+[BY4]", where Y represents a fluorinated organic group. For convenience, fluoroorgano boron and fluoroorgano borate compounds are typically referred to collectively by "organoboron compounds", or by either name as the context requires.<br>
The term "precontacted" mixture is used herein to describe a first mixture of catalyst components that are contacted for a first period of time prior to the first mixture being used to form a "postcontacted" or second mixture of catalyst components that are contacted for a second period of time. Typically, the precontacted mixture describes a mixture of metallocene compound (or compounds), olefin monomer, and organoaluminum compound (or compounds), before this mixture is contacted with the activator-support and optional additional organoaluminum compound. Thus, precontacted describes components that are used to contact each other, but prior to contacting the components in the second, postcontacted mixture. Accordingly, this invention may occasionally distinguish between a component used to prepare the precontacted mixture and that component after the mixture has been prepared. For example, according to this description, it is possible for the precontacted organoaluminum compound, once it is contacted with the metallocene and the olefin monomer, to have reacted to form at least one different chemical compound, formulation, or structure from the distinct organoaluminum compound used to prepare the precontacted mixture. In this case, the precontacted organoaluminum compound or component is described as comprising an organoaluminum compound that was used to prepare the precontacted mixture.<br>
Similarly, the term "postcontacted" mixture is used herein to describe a second mixture of catalyst components that are contacted for a second period of time, and one constituent of which is the "precontacted" or first mixture of catalyst<br>
components that were contacted for a first period of time. Typically, the term "postcontacted" mixture is used herein to describe the mixture of the metallocene compound, olefm monomer, organoaluminum compound, and chemically-treated solid oxide, formed from contacting the precontacted mixture of a portion of these components with any additional components added to make up the postcontacted mixture. Generally, the additional component added to make up the postcontacted mixture is the chemically-treated solid oxide, and, optionally, may include an organoaluminum compound the same or different from the organoaluminum compound used to prepare the precontacted mixture, as described herein. Accordingly, this invention may also occasionally distinguish between a component used to prepare the postcontacted mixture and that component after the mixture has been prepared.<br>
The term "metallocene", as used herein, describes a compound comprising two t|5-cycloalkadienyl-type ligands in the molecule. Thus, the metallocenes of this invention are bis(T]5-cyclopentadienyl-type ligand) compounds, wherein the t]5-cycloalkadienyl portions include cyclopentadienyl ligands, indenyl ligands, fluorenyl ligands, and the like, including partially saturated or substituted derivatives or analogs of any of these. Possible substituents on these ligands include hydrogen, therefore the description "substituted derivatives thereof in this invention comprises partially saturated ligands such as tetrahydroindenyl, tetrahydrofluorenyl, octahydrofluorenyl, partially saturated indenyl, partially saturated fluorenyl, substituted partially saturated indenyl, substituted partially saturated fluorenyl, and the like. In some contexts, the metallocene is referred to simply as the "catalyst", in much the same way the term "cocatalyst" is used herein to refer to the organoaluminum compound. Unless otherwise specified, the following abbreviations are used: Cp for cyclopentadienyl; Ind for indenyl; and Flu for fluorenyl.<br>
The terms "catalyst composition", "catalyst mixture", and the like do not depend upon the actual product resulting from the contact or reaction of the components of the mixtures, the nature of the active catalytic site, or the fate of the aluminum cocatalyst, the metallocene compound, any olefin monomer used to<br>
prepare a precontacted mixture, or the chemically-treated solid oxide after combining these components. Therefore, the terms "catalyst composition", "catalyst mixture", and the like may include both heterogeneous compositions and homogenous compositions.<br>
The term "hydrocarbyl" is used herein to specify a hydrocarbon radical group that includes, but is not limited to aryl, alkyl, cycloallcyl, alkenyl, cycloalkenyl, cycloallcadienyl, alkynyl, aralkyl, aralkenyl, aralkynyl, and the like, and includes all substituted, unsubstituted, branched, linear, heteroatom substituted derivatives thereof.<br>
The terms "chemically-treated solid oxide", "solid oxide activator-support", "acidic activator-support", "activator-support", "treated solid oxide compound", or simply "activator", and the like are used herein to indicate a solid, inorganic oxide of relatively high porosity, which exhibits Lewis acidic or Br0nsted acidic behavior, and which has been treated with an electron-withdrawing component, typically an anion, and which is calcined. The electron-withdrawing component is typically an electron-withdrawing anion source compound. Thus, the chemically-treated solid oxide compound comprises the calcined contact product of at least one solid oxide compound with at least one electron-withdrawing anion source compound. Typically, the chemically-treated solid oxide comprises at least one ionizing, acidic solid oxide compound. The terms "support" and "activator-support" are not used to imply these components are inert, and such components should not be construed as an inert component of the catalyst composition.<br>
Although any methods, devices, and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the invention, the typical methods, devices and materials are herein described.<br>
All publications and patents mentioned herein are incorporated herein by reference for the purpose of describing and disclosing, for example, the constructs and methodologies that are described in the publications, which might be used in connection with the presently described invention. The publications discussed above and throughout the text are provided solely for their disclosure prior to the filing date<br>
of the present application. Nothing herein is to be construed as an admission that the inventors are not entitled to antedate such disclosure by virtue of prior invention.<br>
For any particular compound disclosed herein, any general structure presented also encompasses all conformational isomers, regioisomers, and stereoisomers that may arise from a particular set of substituents. The general structure also encompasses all enantiomers, diastereomers, and other optical isomers whether in enantiomeric or racemic forms, as well as mixtures of stereoisomers, as the context requires.<br>

The present invention further is directed to a method of preparing cyclopentadienyl complexes and a method of isolating such compounds as a solid.<br>
In particular, the present invention relates to new catalyst compositions and methods of using such catalyst compositions to form polyolefins having an excellent balance of stiffness and slow crack growth resistance. The catalyst composition includes at least two metallocenes. The first metallocene compound is used to produce a high molecular weight component, and is generally a tightly bridged metallocene containing a substituent that includes a terminal olefin. The second metallocene, used to produce the low molecular weight component, is generally not bridged and is more responsive to hydrogen than the first metallocene. The metallocenes are combined with a solid activator, an aluminum alkyl compound, and an olefin monomer to produce the desired bimodal polyolefin. It has been discovered that the bi-metallocene catalyst system of the present invention provides a useful combination of polyolefin properties, such as stiffness and slow crack growth resistance, so the resin is suitable for blowing film, forming a pipe, and so forth.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention, a composition of matter is provided. The composition includes a first metallocene compound, a second<br>
metallocene compound, an activator-support, and an organoaluminum compound.

In one aspect, the solid is formed by contacting the reaction mixture with a mixture of CHaClz and pentane to yield the trichlorides as a solid. The ratio of CHzClj to pentane may be 1:2,1:3,1:4,1:5, or 1:6, or any other suitable ratio. Alternatively, a mixture of CH^C^ with hexane may be used.

The amount of CHzClz/pentane mixture used may vary for each reaction mixture, for example, for 38g of (nBuCp)2ZrClz about 150 mL CHzClz and 300 mL of pentane may be used.<br>
The reaction mixture may be contacted several times with the CEbCVpentane mixture if necessary or desired. In one aspect, the reaction mixture may be contacted with the CHzCh/pentane mixture one time. In another aspect, the reaction mixture may be contacted with the CHaCVpentane mixture two times.

2.        The Activator-Support<br>
The present invention encompasses various catalyst compositions including an activator-support comprising a chemically-treated solid oxide. Alternatively, the activator-support may comprise a pillared clay.<br>
he chemically-treated solid oxide exhibits enhanced acidity as compared to the corresponding untreated solid oxide compound. The chemically-treated solid oxide also functions as a catalyst activator as compared to the corresponding untreated solid oxide. While the chemically-treated solid oxide activates the metallocene in the absence of cocatalysts, it is not necessary to eliminate cocatalysts from the catalyst composition. The activation function of the activator-support is evident in the enhanced activity of catalyst composition as a whole, as compared to a catalyst composition containing the corresponding untreated solid oxide. However, it is believed that the chemically-treated solid oxide can function as an activator, even in the absence of an organoaluminum compound, aluminoxanes, organoboron compounds, or ionizing ionic compounds.<br>
The chemically-treated solid oxide may comprise at least one solid oxide treated with at least one electron-withdrawing anion. While not intending to be bound by the following statement, it is believed that treatment of the solid oxide with an electron-withdrawing component augments or enhances the acidity of the oxide. Thus, the activator-support exhibits Lewis or Bransted acidity that is typically greater than the Lewis or Bransted acid strength than the untreated solid oxide, or the activator-support has a greater number of acid sites than the untreated solid oxide, or both. One method to quantify the acidity of the chemically-treated and untreated solid oxide materials is by comparing the polymerization activities of the treated and untreated oxides under acid catalyzed reactions.<br>
The chemically-treated solid oxide of this invention is formed generally from an inorganic solid oxide having a relatively high porosity that exhibits Lewis acidic or Bransted acidic behavior. The solid oxide is chemically-treated with an electron-withdrawing component, typically an electron-withdrawing anion, to form an activator-support.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention, the solid oxide used to prepare the chemically-treated solid oxide may have a pore volume greater than about 0.1 cc/g. According to another aspect of the present invention, the solid oxide may have a pore volume greater than about 0.5 cc/g, According to yet another aspect<br>
f the present invention, the solid oxide may have a pore volume greater than about l.Occ/g.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, the solid oxide may<br>
have a surface area of from about 100 to about 1000 m /g. According to yet another aspect of the present invention, the solid oxide may have a surface area of from<br>
about 200 to about 800 m /g.   According to still another aspect of the present invention, the solid oxide may have a surface area of from about 250 to about 600<br>
m /g.<br>
The chemically-treated solid oxide may comprise a solid inorganic oxide comprising oxygen and at least one element selected from Group 2, 3,4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, or 15 of the periodic table, or comprising oxygen and at least one element selected from the lanthanide or actinide elements. (See: Hawley's Condensed Chemical Dictionary, 11th Ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons; 1995; Cotton, F.A.; Wilkinson, G.; Murillo; C. A.; and Bochmann; M. Advanced Inorganic Chemistry, 6th Ed., Wiley-Interscience, 1999). For example, the inorganic oxide may comprise oxygen and at least one element selected from Al, B, Be, Bi, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ga, La, Mn, Mo, Ni, Sb, Si, Sn, Sr, Th, Ti, V, W, P, Y, Zn orZr.<br>
Suitable examples of solid oxide materials or compounds that can be used to form the chemically-treated solid oxide include, but are not limited to, A12C&gt;3, B203) BeO, Bi203, CdO, Co3O4, Cr203, CuO, Fe2O3, Ga2O3, La2O3, Mn2O3, MoO3, NiO, PaOs, Sb2O5, SiO2, SnO2, SrO, ThO2, TiO2, V2O5, WO3, Y2O3) ZnO, ZrO2) and the like, including mixed oxides thereof, and combinations thereof. For example, the solid oxide may be silica, alumina, silica-alumina, aluminum phosphate, heteropolytungstates, titania, zirconia, magnesia, boria, zinc oxide, mixed oxides thereof, or any combination thereof,<br>
The solid oxide of mis invention encompasses oxide materials such as alumina, "mixed oxide" compounds thereof such as silica-alumina, and combinations and mixtures thereof. The mixed oxide compounds such as silica-alumina can be single or multiple chemical phases with more than one metal combined with oxygen to form a solid oxide compound. Examples of mixed oxides<br>
that can be used in the activator-support of the present invention include, but are not limited to, silica-alumina, silica-titania, silica-zirconia, zeolites, various clay minerals, alumina-titania, alumina-zirconia, zinc-aluminate and the like.<br>
The electron-withdrawing component used to treat the solid oxide may be any component that increases the Lewis or Bronsted acidity of the solid oxide upon treatment (as compared to the solid oxide that is not treated with at least one electron-withdrawing anion). According to one aspect of the present invention, the electron-withdrawing component is an electron-withdrawing anion derived from a salt, an acid, or other compound, such as a volatile organic compound, that may serve as a source or precursor for that anion. Examples of electron-withdrawing anions include, but are not limited to, sulfate, bisulfate, fluoride, chloride, bromide, iodide, fluorosulfate, fluoroborate, phosphate, fluorophosphate, trifluoroacetate, triflate, fluorozirconate, fluorotitanate, trifluoroacetate, triflate, and the like, including mixtures and combinations thereof. In addition, other ionic or non-ionic compounds that serve as sources for these electron-withdrawing anions may also be employed in the present invention.<br>
Thus, for example, the chemically-treated solid oxide used with the present invention may be fluorided alumina, chlorided alumina, bromided alumina, sulfated alumina, fluorided silica-alumina, chlorided silica-alumina, bromided silica-alumina, sulfated silica-alumina, fluorided silica-zirconia, chlorided silica-zirconia, bromided silica-zirconia, sulfated silica-zirconia, or any combination thereof.<br>
When the electron-withdrawing component comprises a salt of an electron-withdrawing anion, the counterion or cation of that salt may be selected from any cation that allows the salt to revert or decompose back to the acid during calcining. Factors that dictate the suitability of the particular salt to serve as a source for the electron-withdrawing anion include, but are not limited to, the solubility of the salt in the desired solvent, the lack of adverse reactivity of the cation, ion-pairing effects between the cation and anion, hygroscopic properties imparted to the salt by the cation, and the like, and thermal stability of the anion. Examples of suitable cations in the salt of the electron-withdrawing anion include, but are not limited to,<br>
ammonium, trialkyl ammonium, tetraalkyl ammonium, tetraalkyl phosphonium, H4", [H(OEt2)2]+, and the like.<br>
Further, combinations of one or more different electron-withdrawing anions, in varying proportions, can be used to tailor the specific acidity of the activator-support to the desired level. Combinations of electron-withdrawing components may be contacted with the oxide material simultaneously or individually, and in any order that affords the desired chemically-treated solid oxide acidity. For example, one aspect of this invention is employing two or more electron-withdrawing anion source compounds in two or more separate contacting steps.<br>
Thus, one example of such a process by which an chemically-treated solid oxide is prepared is as follows: a selected solid oxide compound, or combination of oxide compounds, is contacted with a first electron-withdrawing anion source compound to form a first mixture; this first mixture is calcined and then contacted with a second electron-withdrawing anion source compound to form a second mixture; the second mixture is then calcined to form a treated solid oxide compound. In such a process, the first and second electron-withdrawing anion source compounds may be different compounds or the same compound.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, the chemically-treated solid oxide may comprise a solid inorganic oxide material, a mixed oxide material, or a combination of inorganic oxide materials, that is chemically-treated with an electron-withdrawing component, and optionally treated with a metal source, including metal salts, metal ions, or other metal-containing compounds. The metal or metal ion may be, for example, zinc, nickel, vanadium, titanium, silver, copper, gallium, tin, tungsten, molybdenum, or any combination thereof. Examples of chemically-treated solid oxides that include a metal or metal ion include, but are not limited to, zinc-impregnated chlorided alumina, titanium-impregnated fluorided alumina, zinc-impregnated fluorided alumina, zinc-impregnated chlorided silica-alumina, zinc-impregnated fluorided silica-alumina, zinc-impregnated sulfated alumina, chlorided zinc aluminate, fluorided zinc aluminate, sulfated zinc aluminate, or any combination thereof.<br>
Any method of impregnating the solid oxide material with a metal may be used. The method by which the oxide is contacted with a metal source, typically a salt or metal-containing compound, may include, but is not limited to, gelling, co-gelling, impregnation of one compound onto another, and the like. If desired, the metal-containing compound may be added to or impregnated into the solid oxide in solution form, and subsequently converted into the supported metal upon calcining. Accordingly, the solid inorganic oxide can further comprise a metal selected from zinc, titanium, nickel, vanadium, silver, copper, gallium, tin, tungsten, molybdenum, or a combination thereof. For example, zinc may be used to impregnate the solid oxide because it provides good catalyst activity and low cost.<br>
The solid oxide may be treated with metal salts or metal-containing compounds before, after, or at the same time that the solid oxide is treated with the electron-withdrawing anion. Following any contacting method, the contacted mixture of oxide compound, electron-withdrawing anion, and the metal ion is typically calcined. Alternatively, a solid oxide material, an electron-withdrawing anion source, and the metal salt or metal-containing compound are contacted and calcined simultaneously.<br>
Various processes may be used to form the chemically-treated solid oxide. The chemically-treated solid oxide may comprise the contact product of at least one solid oxide compound and at least one electron-withdrawing anion source. It is not required that the solid oxide compound be calcined prior to contacting the electron-withdrawing anion source. The contact product may be calcined either during or after the solid oxide compound is contacted with the electron-withdrawing anion source. The solid oxide compound may be calcined or uncalcined. Various processes to prepare solid oxide activator-supports that can be employed in this invention have been reported. For example, such methods are described in U.S. Patent Nos, 6,107,230, 6,165,929, 6,294,494, 6,300,271, 6,316,553, 6,355,594, 6,376,415, 6,391,816, 6,395,666, 6,524,987, and 6,548,441, each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention, the solid oxide material may be chemically-treated by contacting it with at least one electron-withdrawing<br>
component, typically an electron-withdrawing anion source. Further, the solid oxide material optionally may be chemically treated with a metal ion, and then calcined to form a metal-containing or metal-impregnated chemically-treated solid oxide, According to another aspect of the present invention, the solid oxide material and electron-withdrawing anion source are contacted and calcined simultaneously.<br>
The method by which the oxide is contacted with the electron-withdrawing component, typically a salt or an acid of an electron-withdrawing anion, may include, but is not limited to, gelling, co-gelling, impregnation of one compound onto another, and the like. Thus, following any contacting method, the contacted mixture of the solid oxide, electron-withdrawing anion, and optional metal ion, is calcined.<br>
The solid oxide activator-support (chemically-treated solid oxide) may thus be produced by a process comprising:<br>
1)	contacting a solid oxide compound with at least one electron-<br>
withdrawing anion source compound to form a first mixture; and<br>
2)	calcining the first mixture to form the solid oxide activator-support.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, the solid oxide<br>
activator-support (chemically-treated solid oxide) may be produced by a process comprising:<br>
1)	contacting at least one solid oxide compound with a first electron-<br>
withdrawing anion source compound to form a first mixture;<br>
2)	calcining the first mixture to produce a calcined first mixture;<br>
3)	contacting  the  calcined  first mixture  with  a  second  electron-<br>
withdrawing anion source compound to form a second mixture; and<br>
4)	calcining the second mixture to form the solid oxide activator-<br>
support.<br>
According to yet another aspect of the present invention, the chemically-treated solid oxide is produced or formed by contacting the solid oxide with the electron-withdrawing anion source compound, where the solid oxide compound is calcined before, during, or after contacting the electron-withdrawing anion source, and where there is a substantial absence of aluminoxanes and organoborates.<br>
Calcining of the treated solid oxide generally is conducted in an ambient atmosphere, typically in a dry ambient atmosphere, at a temperature from about 200°C to about 900°C, for about 1 minute to about 100 hours. Calcining may be conducted at a temperature of from about 300°C to about 800°C, for example, at a temperature of from about 400°C to about 700°C. Calcining may be conducted for about 1 hour to about 50 hours, for example, for about 3 hours to about 20 hours. Thus, for example, calcining may be carried out for about 1 to about 10 hours at a temperature of from about 350°C to about 550°C. Any type of suitable ambient can be used during calcining. Generally, calcining is conducted in an oxidizing atmosphere, such as air. Alternatively, an inert atmosphere, such as nitrogen or argon, or a reducing atmosphere, such as hydrogen or carbon monoxide, may be used.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention, the solid oxide material may be treated with a source of halide ion, sulfate ion, or a combination of anions, optionally treated with a metal ion, and then calcined to provide the chemically-treated solid oxide in the form of a particulate solid. For example, the solid oxide material may be treated with a source of sulfate (termed a "sulfatirig agent"), a source of chloride ion (termed a "chloriding agent"), a source of fluoride ion (termed a "fluoriding agent"), or a combination thereof, and calcined to provide the solid oxide activator. Useful acidic activator-supports include, but are not limited to, bromided alumina, chlorided alumina, fluorided alumina, sulfated alumina, bromided silica-alumina, chlorided silica-alumina, fluorided silica-alumina, sulfated silica-alumina, bromided silica-zirconia, chlorided silica-zirconia, fluorided silica-zirconia, sulfated silica-zirconia; a pillared clay, such as a pillared montmorillonite, optionally treated with fluoride, chloride, or sulfate; phosphated alumina or other aluminophosphates optionally treated with sulfate, fluoride, or chloride; or any combination of the above. Further, any of the activator-supports optionally may be treated with a metal ion.<br>
The chemically-treated solid oxide may comprise a fluorided solid oxide in the form of a particulate solid. The fluorided solid oxide may be formed by contacting a solid oxide with a fluoriding agent. The fluoride ion may be added to<br>
the oxide by forming a slurry of the oxide in a suitable solvent such as alcohol or water including, but are not limited to, the one to three carbon alcohols because of their volatility and low surface tension. Examples of fluoriding agents that may be suitable include, but are not limited to, hydrofluoric acid (HF), ammonium fluoride (N!L)F), ammonium bifluoride (NEUHFz), ammonium tetrafluoroborate (NEUBF/i), ammonium silicofluoride (hexafluorosilicate) ((NILOaSiFg), ammonium hexafluorophosphate (NKUPFe), analogs thereof, and combinations thereof. For example, ammonium bifluoride NTLiHFa may be used as the fluoriding agent, due to its ease of use and ready availability.<br>
If desired, the solid oxide may be treated with a fluoriding agent during the calcining step. Any fluoriding agent capable of thoroughly contacting the solid oxide during the calcining step can be used. For example, in addition to those fluoriding agents described previously, volatile organic fluoriding agents may be used. Examples of volatile organic fluoriding agents useful in this aspect of the invention include, but are not limited to, freons, perfiuorohexane, perfluorobenzene, fluoromethane, trifluoroethanol, and combinations thereof. Gaseous hydrogen fluoride or fluorine itself also can be used with the solid oxide is fluorided during calcining. One convenient method of contacting the solid oxide with the fluoriding agent is to vaporize a fluoriding agent into a gas stream used to fluidize the solid oxide during calcination.<br>
Similarly, in another aspect of this invention, the chemically-treated solid oxide may comprise a chlorided solid oxide in the form of a particulate solid. The chlorided solid oxide may be formed by contacting a solid oxide with a chloriding agent. The chloride ion may be added to the oxide by forming a slurry of the oxide in a suitable solvent. The solid oxide may be treated with a chloriding agent during the calcining step. Any chloriding agent capable of serving as a source of chloride and thoroughly contacting the oxide during the calcining step may be used. For example, volatile organic chloriding agents may be used. Examples of volatile organic chloriding agents that may be suitable include, but are not limited to, certain freons, perchlorobenzene, chloromethane, dichloromethane, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, trichloroethanol, or any combination thereof. Gaseous hydrogen<br>
chloride or chlorine itself may also be used with the solid oxide during calcining. One convenient method of contacting the oxide with the chloriding agent is to vaporize a chloriding agent into a gas stream used to fluidize the solid oxide during calcination.<br>
The amount of fluoride or chloride ion present before calcining the solid oxide may be from about 2 to about 50% by weight, where weight percent is based on the weight of the solid oxide, for example, silica-alumina, before calcining. According to another aspect of this invention, the amount of fluoride or chloride ion present before calcining the solid oxide may be from about 3 to about 25% by weight, and according to another aspect of this invention, may be from about 4 to about 20% by weight. Once impregnated with halide, the halided oxide may be dried by any method known in the art including, but not limited to, suction filtration followed by evaporation, drying under vacuum, spray drying, and the like, although it is also possible to initiate the calcining step immediately without drying the impregnated solid oxide.<br>
The silica-alumina used to prepare the treated silica-alumina typically has a pore volume greater than about 0.5 cc/g. According to one aspect of the present invention, the pore volume may be greater than about 0.8 cc/g, and according to another aspect of the present invention, the pore volume may be greater than about 1.0 cc/g. Further, the silica-alumina may have a surface area greater than about 100 m2/g. According to one aspect of this invention, the surface area may be greater than about 250 m2/g, and according to another aspect of this invention, the surface area may be greater than about 350 m2/g.<br>
The silica-alumina used with the present invention typically has an alumina content from about 5 to about 95%. According to one aspect of this invention, the alumina content of the silica-alumina may be from about 5 to about 50%, and according to another aspect of this invention, the alumina content of the silica-alumina may be from about 8% to about 30% alumina by weight. According to yet another aspect of this invention, the solid oxide component may comprise alumina without silica, and according to another aspect of this invention, the solid oxide component may comprise silica without alumina.<br>
The sulfated solid oxide comprises sulfate and a solid oxide component, such as alumina or silica-alumina, in the form of a particulate solid. Optionally, the sulfated oxide may be treated further with a metal ion such that the calcined sulfated oxide comprises a metal. According to one aspect of the present invention, the sulfated solid oxide comprises sulfate and alumina. In some instances, the sulfated alumina is formed by a process wherein the alumina is treated with a sulfate source, for example, but not limited to, sulfuric acid or a sulfate salt such as ammonium sulfate. This process may be performed by forming a slurry of the alumina in a suitable solvent, such as alcohol or water, in which the desired concentration of the sulfating agent has been added. Suitable organic solvents include, but are not limited to, the one to three carbon alcohols because of their volatility and low surface tension.<br>
According to one aspect of this invention, the amount of sulfate ion present before calcining may be from about 0.5 parts by weight to about 100 parts by weight sulfate ion to about 100 parts by weight solid oxide. According to another aspect of this invention, the amount of sulfate ion present before calcining may be from about 1 part by weight to about 50 parts by weight sulfate ion to about 100 parts by weight solid oxide, and according to still another aspect of this invention, from about 5 parts by weight to about 30 parts by weight sulfate ion to about 100 parts by weight solid oxide. These weight ratios are based on the weight of the solid oxide before calcining. Once impregnated with sulfate, the sulfated oxide may be dried by any method known in the art including, but not limited to, suction filtration followed by evaporation, drying under vacuum, spray drying, and the like, although it is also possible to initiate the calcining step immediately.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, activator-support comprises a pillared clay. The term "pillared clay" is used to refer to clay materials that have been ion exchanged with large, typically polynuclear, highly charged metal complex cations. Examples of such ions include, but are not limited to, Keggin ions which can have charges such as 7+, various polyoxometallates, and other large ions. Thus, the term pillaring refers to a simple exchange reaction in which the exchangeable cations of a clay material are replaced with large, highly charged ions,<br>
such as Keggin ions. These polymeric cations are then immobilized within the interlayers of the clay and when calcined are converted to metal oxide "pillars", effectively supporting the clay layers as column-like structures. Thus, once the clay is dried and calcined to produce the supporting pillars between clay layers, the expanded lattice structure is maintained and the porosity is enhanced. The resulting pores can vary in shape and size as a function of the pillaring material and the parent clay material used. Examples of pillaring and pillared clays are found in: TJ. Pinnavaia, Science 220 (4595), 365-371 (1983); J.M. Thomas, Intercalation Chemistry, (S. Whittington and A. Jacobson, eds.) Ch. 3, pp. 55-99, Academic Press, Inc., (1972); U.S. Patent No. 4,452,910; U.S. Patent No. 5,376,611; and U.S. Patent No. 4,060,480; each of which is incorporated herein in its entirety,<br>
The pillaring process utilizes clay minerals having exchangeable cations and layers capable of expanding. Any pillared clay that can enhance the polymerization of olefins in the catalyst composition of the present invention may be used. Therefore, suitable clay minerals for pillaring include, but are not limited to: allophanes; smectites, both dioctahedral (Al) and tri-octahedral (Mg) and derivatives thereof such as montmorillonites (bentonites), nontronites, hectorites, or laponites; halloysites; vermiculites; micas; fluoromicas; chlorites; mixed-layer clays; the fiberous clays including but not limited to sepiolites, attapulgites, and palygorskites; a serpentine clay; illite; laponite; saponite; and any combination thereof. In one aspect, the pillared clay activator-support comprises bentonite or montmorillonite. The principal component of bentonite is montmorillonite.<br>
The pillared clay may be pretreated if desired. For example, a pillared bentonite may be pretreated by drying at about 300°C under an inert atmosphere, typically dry nitrogen, for about 3 hours, before being added to the polymerization reactor. Although an exemplary pretreatment is described herein, it should be understood that the preheating can be carried out at many other temperatures and times, including any combination of temperature and time steps, all of which are encompassed by this invention.<br>
The activator-support used to prepare the catalyst compositions of the present invention may be combined with other inorganic support materials, including, but<br>
are not limited to, zeolites, inorganic oxides, phosphated inorganic oxides, and the like. In one aspect, typical support materials that may be used include, but are not limited to, silica, silica-alumina, alumina, titania, zirconia, magnesia, boria, fluorided alumina, silated alumina, thoria, aluminophosphate, aluminum phosphate, phosphated silica, phosphated alumina, silica-titania, coprecipitated silica/titania, fluorided/silated alumina, and any combination or mixture thereof.<br>
According to yet another aspect of the present invention, one or more of the metallocene compounds may be precontacted with an olefin monomer and an organoaluminum compound for a first period of time prior to contacting this mixture with the activator-support. Once the precontacted mixture of the metallocene compound(s), olefin monomer, and organoaluminum compound is contacted with the activator-support, the composition further comprising the activator-support is termed the "postcontacted" mixture. The postcontacted mixture may be allowed to remain in further contact for a second period of time prior to being charged into the reactor in which the polymerization process will be carried out.<br>

Examples of (X9) moieties include, but are not limited to, ethyl, propyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, isobutyl, hexyl, and the like. According to another aspect of the<br>
present invention, (X10) may be independently selected from fluoro or chloro. According to yet another aspect of the present invention, (X10) may be chloro. In the formula Al(X9)n(X10)3.m n is a number from 1 to 3 inclusive, and typically, n is 3. The value of n is not restricted to be an integer; therefore, this formula includes sesquihalide compounds or other organoaluminum cluster compounds.<br>
Examples of organoaluminum compounds that may be suitable for use with the present invention include, but are not limited to, trialkylaluminum compounds, dialkylaluminium halide compounds, dialkylaluminum alkoxide compounds, dialkylaluminum hydride compounds, and combinations thereof.

The present invention contemplates precontacting the first metallocene compound, the second metallocene compound, or both, with at least one organoaluminum compound and an olefin monomer to form a precontacted mixture, prior to contacting this precontacted mixture with the activator-support to form the active catalyst. When the catalyst composition is prepared in this manner, typically, though not necessarily, a portion of the organoaluminum compound is added to the precontacted mixture and another portion of the organoaluminum compound is added to the postcontacted mixture prepared when the precontacted mixture is contacted with the solid oxide activator. However, the entire organoaluminum compound may be used to prepare the catalyst in either the precontacting or postcontacting step. Alternatively, all the catalyst components may be contacted in a single step.<br>
Further, more than one organoaluminum compound may be used in either the precontacting or the postcontacting step. When an organoaluminum compound is added in multiple steps, the amounts of organoaluminum compound disclosed herein include the total amount of organoaluminum compound used in both the precontacted and postcontacted mixtures, and any additional organoaluminum compound added to the polymerization reactor. Therefore, total amounts of<br>
organoaluminum compounds are disclosed regardless of whether a single organoalurainum compound or more than one organoaluminum compound is used.<br>
4.        The Optional Aluminoxane Cocatalyst<br>
The present invention further provides a catalyst composition comprising an optional aluminoxane cocatalyst. As used herein, the term "aluminoxane" refers to aluminoxane compounds, compositions, mixtures, or discrete species, regardless of how such aluminoxanes are prepared, formed or otherwise provided. For example, a catalyst composition comprising an optional aluminoxane cocatalyst can be prepared in which aluminoxane is provided as the poly(hydrocarbyl aluminum oxide), or in which aluminoxane is provided as the combination of an aluminum alkyl compound and a source of active protons such as water. Aluminoxanes are also referred to as poly(hydrocarbyl aluminum oxides) or organoaluminoxanes.<br>
The other catalyst components typically are contacted with the aluminoxane in a saturated hydrocarbon compound solvent, though any solvent that is substantially inert to the reactants, intermediates, and products of the activation step may be used. The catalyst composition formed in this manner may be collected by methods known to those of skill in the art including, but not limited to, filtration. Alternatively, the catalyst composition may be introduced into the polymerization reactor without being isolated.<br>
The aluminoxane compound of this invention may be an oligomeric aluminum compound comprising linear structures, cyclic, or cage structures, or mixtures of all three. Cyclic aluminoxane compounds having the formula:<br>

wherein R is a linear or branched alkyl having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, and n is an integer from 3 to about 10, are encompassed by this invention. The (AlRO)n moiety shown here also constitutes the repeating unit in a linear aluminoxane. Thus, linear aluminoxanes having the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R is a linear or branched alkyl having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, and n is an integer from 1 to about 50, are also encompassed by this invention.<br>
Further, aluminoxanes may also have cage structures of the formula R'sm+aRVaAUmOam, wherein m is 3 or 4 and a is = nAi(3) - Hop) + no(4), wherein iiAi(3) is the number of three coordinate aluminum atoms, noo is the number of two coordinate oxygen atoms, no(4) is the number of 4 coordinate oxygen atoms, R' is a terminal alkyl group, and Rb is a bridging alkyl group, and R is a linear or branched alkyl having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms.<br>
Thus, aluminoxanes that may serve as optional cocatalysts in this invention are represented generally by formulas such as (R-Al-O)n, R(R-Al-O)nAlR2, and the like, wherein the R group is typically a linear or branched Ci-Cg alkyl such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, or hexyl, and n typically represents an integer from 1 to about 50. Examples of aluminoxane compounds that may be used in accordance with the present invention include, but are not limited to, methylaluminoxane, ethylaluminoxane, n-propylaluminoxane, iso-propyl-aluminoxane, n-butylaluminoxane, t-butylaluminoxane, sec-butylaluminoxane, iso-butylaluminoxane, 1-pentylaluminoxane, 2-pentylaluminoxane, 3-pentyl-aluminoxane, iso-pentylaluminoxane, neopentylaluminoxane, or any combination thereof. Methyl aluminoxane, ethyl aluminoxane, and isobutyl aluminoxane are prepared from trimethylaluminum, triethylaluminum, or triisobutylaluminum, respectively, and sometimes are referred to as poly(methyl aluminum oxide), poly(ethyl aluminum oxide), and poly(isobutyl aluminum oxide), respectively. It is also within the scope of the invention to use an aluminoxane in combination with a trialkylaluminum, such as that disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,794,096, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
The present invention contemplates many values of n in the aluminoxane formulas (R-Al~0)n and R(R-Al-0)nAlR2, and n typically may be at least about 3.<br><br>
However, depending upon how the organoaluminoxane is prepared, stored, and used, the value of n may vary within a single sample of aluminoxane, and such combinations of organoaluminoxanes are contemplated hereby.<br>
In preparing the catalyst composition of this invention comprising an optional aluminoxane, the molar ratio of the aluminum in the aluminoxane to the metallocene in the composition may be from about 1:10 to about 100,000:1, for example, from about 5:1 to about 15,000:1. The amount of optional aluminoxane added to a polymerization zone may be from about 0.01 mg/L to about 1000 mg/L, from about 0.1 mg/L to about 100 mg/L, or from about 1 mg/L to about 50 mg/L.<br>
Organoaluminoxanes may be prepared by various procedures that are well known in the art. Examples of organoaluminoxane preparations are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,242,099 and 4,808,561, each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. For example, water in an inert organic solvent may be reacted with an aluminum alkyl compound such as AIRs to form the desired organoaluminoxane compound. While not intending to be bound by this statement, it is believed that this synthetic method can afford a mixture of both linear and cyclic (R-Al-O)n alummoxane species, both of which are encompassed by this invention. Alternatively, organoaluminoxanes may be prepared by reacting an aluminum alkyl compound, such as AIRs with a hydrated salt, such as hydrated copper sulfate, in an inert organic solvent.<br>
5-        The Optional Organoboron Cocatalvst<br>
The present invention further provides a catalyst composition comprising an optional organoboron cocatalyst. The organoboron compound may comprise neutral boron compounds, borate salts, or any combination thereof. For example, the organoboron compounds of this invention may comprise a fluoroorgano boron compound, a fluoroorgano borate compound, or a combination thereof.<br>
Any fluoroorgano boron or fluoroorgano borate compound known in the art can be utilized with the present invention. Examples of fluoroorgano borate compounds that may be used as cocatalysts in the present invention include, but are not limited to, fluorinated aryl borates such as N,N-dimethylanilinium tetrakis-(pentafluorophenyl)borate, triphenylcarbenium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate,<br>
lithium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate, N,N-dimethylanilinium tetrakis[3,5-<br>
bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate,	triphenylcarbenium	tetrakis[3,5-<br>
bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate, and the like, including mixtures thereof. Examples of fluoroorgano boron compounds that can be used as cocatalysts in the present invention include, but are not limited to, tris(pentafluorophenyl)boron, tris[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]boron, and the like, including mixtures thereof. Although not intending to be bound by the following theory, these examples of fluoroorgano borate and fluoroorgano boron compounds, and related compounds, are thought to form "weakly-coordinating" anions when combined with organometal compounds, as disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,919,983, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
Generally, any amount of organoboron compound may be used. According to one aspect of this invention, the molar ratio of the organoboron compound to the metallocene compound in the composition may be from about 0.1:1 to about 10:1. Typically, the amount of the fluoroorgano boron or fluoroorgano borate compound used as a cocatalyst for the metallocenes may be from about 0.5 mole to about 10 moles of boron compound per total moles of the metallocene compounds. According to another aspect of this invention, the amount of fluoroorgano boron or fluoroorgano borate compound may be from about 0.8 mole to about 5 moles of boron compound per total moles of the metallocene compound.<br>
6. The Optional Ionizing Ionic Compound Cocatalvst The present invention further provides a catalyst composition comprising an optional ionizing ionic compound cocatalyst. An ionizing ionic compound is an ionic compound that can function to enhance the activity of the catalyst composition. While not intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that the ionizing ionic compound may be capable of reacting with a metallocene compound and converting the metallocene into one or more cationic metallocene compounds, or incipient cationic metallocene compounds. Again, while not intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that the ionizing ionic compound may function as an ionizing compound by completely or partially extracting an anionic ligand, possibly a non--n5-alkadienyl ligand such as (X3) or (X4), from the metallocene. However, the ionizing<br>
ionic compound is an activator regardless of whether it is ionizes the metallocene, abstracts an (X3) or (X4) ligand in a fashion as to form an ion pair, weakens the metal-(X3) or metal-(X4) bond in the metallocene, simply coordinates to an (X3) or (X4) ligand, or activates the metallocene by some other mechanism.<br>
Further, it is not necessary that the ionizing ionic compound activate the metallocenes only. The activation function of the ionizing ionic compound is evident in the enhanced activity of catalyst composition as a whole, as compared to a catalyst composition containing catalyst composition that does not comprise any ionizing ionic compound. It is also not necessary that the ionizing ionic compound activate each of the metallocene compounds present, nor is it necessary that it activate the any of the metallocene compounds to the same extent.<br>
Examples of ionizing ionic compounds include, but are not limited to, the<br>
following compounds: tri(n-butyl)ammonium tetrakis(p-tolyl)borate, tri(n-butyl)-<br>
ammonium tetrakis(m-tolyl)borate, tri(n-butyl)ammonium tetrakis(2,4-dimethyl)-<br>

potassium tetrakis (3,5-dimethylphenyl)aluminate, potassium tetrafluoroaluminate, and the like. However, the optional ionizing ionic compounds that are useful in mis invention are not limited to these. Other examples of ionizing ionic compounds are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,576,259 and 5,807,938, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. B. Olefin Monomer<br>
Unsaturated reactants that may be useful with catalyst compositions and polymerization processes of this invention include olefin compounds having from about 2 to about 30 carbon atoms per molecule and at least one olefinic double bond. This invention encompasses homopolymerization processes using a single olefin such as ethylene or propylene, as well as copolymerization reactions with at least one different olefinic compound. The resulting copolymer may comprise a major amount of ethylene (&gt;50 mole percent) and a minor amount of comonomer 
Acyclic, cyclic, polycyclic, terminal (a), internal, linear, branched, substituted, unsubstituted, functionalized, and non-functionalized olefins may be employed in this invention. For example, typical unsaturated compounds that may be polymerized with the catalysts of this invention include, but are not limited to, propylene, 1-butene, 2-butene, 3-methyl-l-butene, isobutylene, 1-pentene, 2-pentene, 3-methyl-1-pentene, 4-methyl-l-pentene, 1-hexene, 2-hexene, 3-hexene, 3-ethyl-1-hexene, 1-heptene, 2-heptene, 3-heptene, the four normal octenes, the four normal nonenes, the five normal decenes, and mixtures of any two or more thereof. Cyclic and bicyclic olefins, including but not limited to, cyclopentene, cyclohexene, norbomylene, norbomadiene, and the like, may also be polymerized as described above.<br>
When a copolymer is desired, the monomer ethylene may be copolymerized with a comonomer. Examples of the comonomer include, but are not limited to, propylene, 1-butene, 2-butene, 3-methyl-l-butene, isobutylene, 1-pentene, 2-pentene, 3-methyl-1-pentene, 4-methyl-l-pentene, 1-hexene, 2-hexene, 3-hexene, 3-<br>
ethyl- 1-hexene, 1-heptene, 2-heptene, 3-heptene, the four normal octenes, the four normal nonenes, or the five normal decenes. According to one aspect of the present invention, the comonomer may be selected from 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-octene, 1-decene, or styrene.<br>
The amount of comonomer introduced into a reactor zone to produce the copolymer generally may be from about 0.01 to about 50 weight percent comonomer based on the total weight of the monomer and comonomer. According to another aspect of the present invention, the amount of comonomer introduced into a reactor zone may be from about 0.01 to about 40 weight percent comonomer based on the total weight of the monomer and comonomer. According to still another aspect of the present invention, the amount of comonomer introduced into a reactor zone may be from about 0.1 to about 35 weight percent comonomer based on the total weight of the monomer and comonomer. Alternatively, the amount of comonomer introduced into a reactor zone may be any amount sufficient to provide the above concentrations by weight.<br>
While not intending to be bound by this theory, where branched, substituted, or functionalized olefins are used as reactants, it is believed that steric hindrance may impede and/or slow the polymerization process. Thus, branched and/or cyclic portion(s) of the olefin removed somewhat from the carbon-carbon double bond would not be expected to hinder the reaction in the way that the same olefin substituents situated more proximate to the carbon-carbon double bond might. According to one aspect of the present invention, at least one reactant for the catalyst compositions of this invention may be ethylene, so the polymerizations are either homopolymerizations or copolymerizations with a different acyclic, cyclic, terminal, internal, linear, branched, substituted, or unsubstituted olefin. In addition, the catalyst compositions of this invention may be used in the polymerization of diolefin compounds including, but not limited to, 1,3-butadiene, isoprene, 1,4-pentadiene, and 1,5-hexadiene. C. Preparation of the Catalyst Composition<br>
The present invention encompasses a catalyst composition comprising the contact product of a first metallocene compound, a second metallocene compound,<br><br>
an activator-support, and an organoaluminum compound. This invention further encompasses methods of making the catalyst composition encompassing contacting a first metallocene compound, a second metallocene compound, an activator-support, and an organoaluminum compound, in any order. According to such methods, an active catalyst composition is obtained when the catalyst components are contacted in any sequence or order.<br>
One or more of the metallocene compounds may be precontacted with an olefinic monomer if desired, not necessarily the olefin monomer to be polymerized, and an organoaluminum cocatalyst for a first period of time prior to contacting this precontacted mixture with the activator-support. The first period of time for contact, the precontact time, between the metallocene compound or compounds, the olefinic monomer, and the organoaluminum compound typically may range from time about 0.1 hour to about 24 hours, for example, from about 0.1 to about 1 hour. Precontact times from about 10 minutes to about 30 minutes are also typical.<br>
Once the precontacted mixture of the metallocene compound or compounds, olefin monomer, and organoaluminum cocatalyst is contacted with the activator-support, this composition (further comprising the activator-support) is termed the "postcontacted mixture". The postcontacted mixture optionally may be allowed to remain in contact for a second period of time, the postcontact time, prior to initiating the polymerization process. Postcontact times between the precontacted mixture and the activator-support may range in time from about 0.1 hour to about 24 hours, for example, from about 0.1 hour to about 1 hour. The precontacting, the postcontacting step, or both may increase the productivity of the polymer as compared to the same catalyst composition that is prepared without precontacting or postcontacting. However, neither a precontacting step nor a postcontacting step is required.<br>
The postcontacted mixture may be heated at a temperature and for a duration sufficient to allow adsorption, impregnation, or interaction of precontacted mixture and the activator-support, such that a portion of the components of the precontacted mixture is immobilized, adsorbed, or deposited thereon. Where heating is used, the postcontacted mixture may be heated from between about 0°F to about 150°F, for example, from about 40°F to about 95°F.<br>
According to one aspect of this invention, the molar ratio of the total moles of the metallocene compounds to the organoaluminum compound may be from about 1:1 to about 1:10,000. According to another aspect of this invention, the molar ratio of the total moles of the metallocene compounds combined to the organoaluminum compound may be from about 1:1 to about 1:1,000. According to yet another aspect of this invention, the molar ratio of the total moles of the metallocene compounds combined to the organoaluminum compound may be from about 1:1 to about 1:100. These molar ratios reflect the ratio of the metallocene compounds to the total amount of organoaluminum compound in both the precontacted mixture and the postcontacted mixture combined.<br>
When a precontacting step is used, the molar ratio of olefin monomer to total moles of metallocene compound combined in the precontacted mixture may be from about 1:10 to about 100,000:1, for example, from about 10:1 to about 1,000:1.<br>
The weight ratio of the activator-support to the organoaluminum compound maybe from about 1:5 to about 1,000:1. The weight ratio of the activator-support to the organoaluminum compound maybe from about 1:3 to about 100:1, for example, from about 1:1 to about 50:1.<br>
According to a further aspect of this invention, the weight ratio of the total moles of the metallocene compound combined to the activator-support may be from about 1:1 to about 1:1,000,000. According to yet another aspect of this invention, the weight ratio of the total moles of the metallocene compound combined to the activator-support may be from about 1:10 to about 1:10,000. According to still another aspect of this invention, the weight ratio of the total moles of the metallocene compound combined to the activator-support may be from about 1:20 to about 1:1000.<br>
Aluminoxane compounds are not required to form the catalyst composition of the present invention. Thus, the polymerization proceeds in the absence of aluminoxanes. Accordingly, the present invention may use AlRs-type organoaluminum compounds and an activator-support in the absence of aluminoxanes. While not intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that the organoaluminum compound likely does not activate the metallocene catalyst in the<br>
same manner as an organoaluminoxane. As a result, the present invention results in lower polymer production costs.<br>
Additionally, no expensive borate compounds or MgCl2 are required to form the catalyst composition of this invention. Nonetheless, aluminoxanes, organoboron compounds, ionizing ionic compounds, organozinc compounds, MgClz, or any combination thereof optionally may be used in the catalyst composition of this invention. Further, cocatalysts such as aluminoxanes, organoboron compounds, ionizing ionic compounds, organozinc compounds, or any combination thereof optionally may be used as cocatalysts with the metallocene compound, either in the presence or in the absence of the activator-support, and either in the presence or in the absence of the organoaluminum compound.<br>
According to one aspect of this invention, the catalyst activity of the catalyst of this invention may be greater than or equal to about 100 grams polyethylene per gram of chemically-treated solid oxide per hour (abbreviated gP/(gCTSO-hr)). According to another aspect of this invention, the catalyst of this invention may be characterized by an activity of greater than or equal to about 250 gP/(gCTSO-hr). According to still another aspect of this invention, the catalyst of this invention may be characterized by an activity of greater than or equal to about 500 gP/(gCTSO-hr). According to yet another aspect of this invention, the catalyst of this invention may be characterized by an activity of greater than or equal to about 1000 gP/(gCTSO-hr). According to a further aspect of this invention, the catalyst of this invention may be characterized by an activity of greater than or equal to about 2000 gP/(gCTSO-hr), This activity is measured under slurry polymerization conditions using isobutane as the diluent, at a polymerization temperature of about 90°C and an ethylene pressure of about 550 psig. The reactor should have substantially no indication of any wall scale, coating or other forms of fouling upon making these measurements.<br>
Any combination of the metallocene compounds, the activator-support, the organoaluminum compound, and the olefin monomer, may be precontacted. When any precontacting occurs with an olefinic monomer, it is not necessary that the olefin<br>
monomer used in the precontacting step be the same as the olefin to be polymerized, Further, when a precontacting step among any combination of the catalyst components is employed for a first period of time, this precontacted mixture may be used in a subsequent postcontacting step between any other combination of catalyst components for a second period of time. For example, all the catalyst components and 1-hexene may be used in a precontacting step for a first period of time, and this precontacted mixture may then be contacted with the activator-support to form a postcontacted mixture that is contacted for a second period of time prior to initiating the polymerization reaction. For example, the first period of time for contact, the precontact time, between any combination of the metallocene compounds, the olefinic monomer, the activator-support, and the organoaluminum compound may be from about 0.1 hour to about 24 hours, for example, from about 0.1 to about 1 hour. Precontact times from about 10 minutes to about 30 minutes are also typical. The postcontacted mixture optionally may be allowed to remain in contact for a second period of time, the postcontact time, prior to initiating the polymerization process. According to one aspect of this invention, postcontact times between the precontacted mixture and any remaining catalyst components may be from about 0.1 hour to about 24 hours, for example, from about 0.1 hour to about 1 hour. D. Use of the Catalyst Composition in Polymerization Processes<br>
After catalyst activation, the catalyst composition is used to homopolymerize ethylene or copolymerize ethylene with a comonomer.<br>
The polymerization temperature may be from about 60°C to about 280°C, for example, from about 70°C to about 110°C. The polymerization reaction typically begins in an inert atmosphere substantially free of oxygen and under substantially anhydrous conditions. For example, a dry, inert atmosphere such as dry nitrogen or dry argon may be used.<br>
The polymerization reaction pressure may be any pressure that does not terminate the polymerization reaction, and is typically a pressure higher than the pretreatment pressures. According to one aspect of the present invention, the polymerization pressure may be from about atmospheric pressure to about 1000 psig. According to another aspect of the present invention, the polymerization pressure<br>
may be from about 50 psig to about 800 psig. Further, hydrogen can be used in the polymerization process of this invention to control polymer molecular weight.<br>
Polymerizations using the catalysts of this invention may be carried out in any manner known in the art. Such processes that may be suitable for use with the present invention include, but are not limited to, slurry polymerizations, gas phase polymerizations, solution polymerizations, and multi-reactor combinations thereof. Thus, any polymerization zone known in the art to produce olefm-containing polymers can be utilized. For example, a stirred reactor may be utilized for a batch process, or a loop reactor or a continuous stirred reactor may be used for a continuous process.<br>
A typical polymerization method is a slurry polymerization process (also known as the particle form process), which is well known in the art and is disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 3,248,179, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Other polymerization methods of the present invention for slurry processes are those employing a loop reactor of the type disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,248,179, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, and those utilized in a plurality of stirred reactors either in series, parallel, or combinations thereof, where the reaction conditions are different in the different reactors. Suitable diluents used in slurry polymerization are well known in the art and include hydrocarbons that are liquids under reaction conditions. The term "diluent" as used in this disclosure does not necessarily mean an inert material, as this term is meant to include compounds and compositions that may contribute to polymerization process. Examples of hydrocarbons that may be used as diluents include, but are not limited to, cyclohexane, isobutane, n-butane, propane, n-pentane, isopentane, neopentane, and n-hexane. Typically, isobutane may be used as the diluent in a slurry polymerization, as provided by U.S. Patent Nos. 4,424,341, 4,501,885, 4,613,484, 4,737,280, and 5,597,892, each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.<br>
Various polymerization reactors are contemplated by the present invention. As used herein, "polymerization reactor" includes any polymerization reactor or polymerization reactor system capable of polymerizing olefin monomers to produce<br>
homopolymers or copolymers of the present invention. Such reactors may be slurry reactors, gas-phase reactors, solution reactors, or any combination thereof. Gas phase reactors may comprise fluidized bed reactors or tubular reactors. Slurry reactors may comprise vertical loops or horizontal loops. Solution reactors may comprise stirred tank or autoclave reactors.<br>
Polymerization reactors suitable for the present invention may comprise at least one raw material feed system, at least one feed system for catalyst or catalyst components, at least one reactor system, at least one polymer recovery system or any suitable combination thereof. Suitable reactors for the present invention further may comprise any one, or combination of, a catalyst storage system, an extrusion system, a cooling system, a diluent recycling system, or a control system. Such reactors may comprise continuous take-off and direct recycling of catalyst, diluent, and polymer. Generally, continuous processes may comprise the continuous introduction of a monomer, a catalyst, and a diluent into a polymerization reactor and the continuous removal from this reactor of a suspension comprising polymer particles and the diluent.<br>
Polymerization reactor systems of the present invention may comprise one type of reactor per system or multiple reactor systems comprising two or more types of reactors operated in parallel or in series. Multiple reactor systems may comprise reactors connected together to perform polymerization or reactors that are not connected. The polymer may be polymerized in one reactor under one set of conditions, and then transferred to a second reactor for polymerization under a different set of conditions.<br>
According to one aspect of the invention, the polymerization reactor system may comprise at least one loop slurry reactor. Such reactors are known in the art and may comprise vertical or horizontal loops. Such loops may comprise a single loop or a series of loops. Multiple loop reactors may comprise both vertical and horizontal loops. The slurry polymerization is typically performed in an organic solvent that can disperse the catalyst and polymer. Examples of suitable solvents include butane, hexane, cyclohexane, octane, and isobutane. Monomer, solvent, catalyst and any comonomer may be continuously fed to a loop reactor where<br>
polymerization occurs.     Polymerization may occur at low temperatures and pressures. Reactor effluent may be flashed to remove the solid resin.<br>
According to yet another aspect of this invention, the polymerization reactor may comprise at least one gas phase reactor. Such systems may employ a continuous recycle stream containing one or more monomers continuously cycled through the fluidized bed in the presence of the catalyst under polymerization conditions. The recycle stream may be withdrawn from the fluidized bed and recycled back into the reactor. Simultaneously, polymer product may be withdrawn from the reactor and new or fresh monomer may be added to replace the polymerized monomer. Such gas phase reactors may comprise a process for multi-step gas-phase polymerization of olefins, in which olefins are polymerized in the gaseous phase in at least two independent gas-phase polymerization zones while feeding a catalyst-containing polymer formed in a first polymerization zone to a second polymerization zone.<br>
According to still another aspect of the invention, the polymerization reactor may comprise a tubular reactor. Tubular reactors may make polymers by free radical initiation, or by employing the catalysts typically used for coordination polymerization. Tubular reactors may have several zones where fresh monomer, initiators, or catalysts are added. Monomer may be entrained in an inert gaseous stream and introduced at one zone of the reactor. Initiators, catalysts, and/or catalyst components may be entrained in a gaseous stream and introduced at another zone of the reactor. The gas streams may be intermixed for polymerization. Heat and pressure may be employed appropriately to obtain optimal polymerization reaction conditions.<br>
According to yet another aspect of the invention, the polymerization reactor may comprise a solution polymerization reactor. During solution polymerization, the monomer is contacted with the catalyst composition by suitable stirring or other means. A carrier comprising an inert organic diluent or excess monomer may be employed. If desired, the monomer may be brought in the vapor phase into contact with the catalytic reaction product, in the presence or absence of liquid material. The polymerization zone is maintained at temperatures and pressures that will result<br>
in the formation of a solution of the polymer in a reaction medium. Agitation may be employed during polymerization to obtain better temperature control and to maintain uniform polymerization mixtures throughout the polymerization zone. Adequate means are utilized for dissipating the exothermic heat of polymerization. The polymerization may be effected in a batch manner, or in a continuous manner. The reactor may comprise a series of at least one separator that employs high pressure and low pressure to separate the desired polymer.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention, the polymerization reactor system may comprise the combination of two or more reactors. Production of polymers in multiple reactors may include several stages in at least two separate polymerization reactors interconnected by a transfer device making it possible to transfer the polymers resulting from the first polymerization reactor into the second reactor. The desired polymerization conditions in one of the reactors may be different from the operating conditions of the other reactors. Alternatively, polymerization in multiple reactors may include the manual transfer of polymer from one reactor to subsequent reactors for continued polymerization. Such reactors may include any combination including, but not limited to, multiple loop reactors, multiple gas reactors, a combination of loop and gas reactors, a combination of autoclave reactors or solution reactors with gas or loop reactors, multiple solution reactors, or multiple autoclave reactors.<br>
After the polymer is produced, it may be formed into various articles, including but not limited to, household containers, utensils, film products, drums, fuel tanks, pipes, geomembranes, and liners. Various processes may be used to form these articles. Usually, additives and modifiers are added to the polymer in order to provide desired effects. By using the invention described herein, articles can likely be produced at a lower cost, while maintaining most or all of the unique properties of polymers produced with metallocene catalysts. E. Pipe Extrusion<br>
According to one aspect, a method of making a PE-100 pipe is encompassed by the present invention, the method comprising extruding the polymer or copolymer in a molten state through a die to form the PE-100 pipe and cooling the pipe.<br>
According to yet other aspects, a PE-100 pipe comprising the polymer or copolymer of the present invention is contemplated.<br>
Pipe extrusion in the simplest terms is performed by melting, conveying polyethylene pellets into a particular shape (generally an annular shape), and solidifying that shape during a cooling process. There are numerous steps to pipe extrusion as provided below.<br>
The polymer feedstock can either be a pre-pigmented polyethylene resin or it can be a mixture of natural polyethylene and color concentrate (referred to as "Salt and Pepper blends"). In North American, the most common feedstock for pipe extrusion is "Salt and Pepper blends". In Europe and other areas of the world, the most common feedstock for pipe extrusion is pre-pigmented polyethylene resin. Feedstock is rigidly controlled to obtain the proper finished product (pipe) and ultimate consumer specifications.<br>
The feedstock is then fed into an extruder. The most common extruder system for pipe production is a single-screw extruder. The purpose of the extruder is to melt, convey and homogenize the polyethylene pellets. Extrusion temperatures typically range from 178°C to 232°C depending upon the extruder screw design and flow properties of the polyethylene.<br>
The molten polymer is then passed through a die. The die distributes the homogenous polyethylene polymer melt around a solid mandrel, which forms it into an annular shape. Adjustments can be made at the die exit to try to compensate for polymer sag through the rest of the process.<br>
In order for the pipe to meet the proper dimensional parameters, the pipe is then sized. There are two methods for sizing: vacuum or pressure. Both employ different techniques and. different equipment.<br>
Next, the pipe is cooled and solidified in the desired dimensions. Cooling is accomplished by the use of several water tanks where the outside pipe is either submerged or water is sprayed on the pipe exterior. The pipe is cooled from the outside surface to the inside surface. The interior wall and inside surfaces of the pipe can stay very hot for a long period of time, as polyethylene is a poor conductor of heat.<br>
Finally, the pipe is printed and either coiled or cut to length.<br>
The present invention is further illustrated by the following examples, which are not to be construed in any way as imposing limitations upon the scope thereof. On the contrary, it is to be clearly understood that resort may be had to various other aspects, embodiments, modifications, and equivalents thereof which, after reading the description herein, may be suggested to one of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the spirit of the present invention or the scope of the appended claims.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
For each of the following examples, testing procedures were as follows.<br>
Melt index (MI, g/10 min) was determined in accordance with ASTM D1238 condition F at 190°C with a 2,160 gram weight.<br>
High load melt index (HLMI, g/10 min) was determined in accordance with ASTM D1238 condition E at 190°C with a 21,600 gram weight.<br>

Melt rheological characterizations were performed as follows. Small-strain (10%) oscillatory shear measurements were performed on a Rheometrics Scientific, Inc. ARES rheometer using parallel-plate geometry. All rheological tests were performed at 190°C The complex viscosity |?7*| versus frequency (to) data were then curve fitted using the modified three parameter Carrie-Yasuda (CY) empirical model to obtain the zero shear viscosity - 7/0, characteristic viscous relaxation time - r,, and the breadth parameter - a. The simplified Yasuda-Yasuda (CY) empirical model is as follows.<br>
wherein:         \ri*(®) I = magnitude of complex shear viscosity; 770= zero shear viscosity;<br>
r,j = viscous relaxation time;<br>
a = "breadth" parameter;<br>
n = fixes the final power law slope, fixed at 2/11; and<br>

A "Quantachrome Autosorb-6 Nitrogen Pore Size Distribution Instrument" was used to determined specific surface area ("surface area") and specific pore volume ("pore volume"). This instrument was acquired from the Quantachrome Corporation, Syosset, N.Y.<br>
Molecular weights and molecular weight distributions were obtained using a PL 220 SEC high temperature chromatography unit (Polymer Laboratories) with trichlorobenzene (TCB) as the solvent, with a flow rate of 1 mL/minute at a temperature of 145°C. BHT (2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol) at a concentration of 0.5 g/L was used as a stabilizer in the TCB. An injection volume of 200 |LiL was used with a nominal polymer concentration of 1.5 mg/mL. Dissolution of the sample in stabilized TCB was carried out by heating at 150°C for 5 hours with occasional, gentle agitation. The columns used were three PLgel Mixed A LS columns (7.8x3 00mm) and were calibrated with a broad linear polyethylene standard (Phillips Marlex® BHB 5003) for which the molecular weight had been determined.<br>
Molecular weight distributions and branch profiles were obtained through size exclusion chromatography using an FTIR detector. Chromatographic conditions are those described above. However, the sample injection volume was 500 uL. Samples were introduced to the FTIR detector via a heated transfer line and flow cell (KBr windows, 1 mm optical path, and ca. 70 uL cell volume). The temperatures of<br>
the transfer line and flow cell were kept at 143 ± 1°C and 140 + 1°C, respectively. Perkin Elmer FTIR spectre-photometer (PE 2000) equipped with a narrow band mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) detector was used in these studies.<br>
All spectra were acquired using Perkin Elmer Timebase software. Background spectra of the TCB solvent were obtained prior to each run. All IR spectra were measured at 8 cm"1 resolution (16 scans). Chromatograms were generated using the root mean square absorbance over the 3000-2700 cm"1 spectral region (i.e., FTIR serves as a concentration detector). Molecular weight calculations were made as previously described using a broad molecular weight polyethylene (PE) standard [see Jordens K, Wilkes GL, Janzen J, Rohlfing DC, Welch MB. Polymer 2000;41:7175]. Spectra from individual time slices of the chromatogram are subsequently analyzed for comonomer branch levels using chemometric techniques. All calibration spectra were taken at sample concentrations which far exceeded that needed for good signal to noise (i.e., &gt; 0.08 mg /mL at the detector).<br>
Branching determination was made as follows. Narrow molecular weight (MJMn -1.1 tol.3), solvent gradient fractions of ethylene 1-butene, ethylene 1-hexene, polyethylene homopolymers, and low molecular weight alkanes were used in calibration and verification studies. The total methyl content of these samples ranged from 1.4 to 82.7 methyls per 1000 total carbons. Methyl content of samples was calculated from Ma or measured using C-13 NMR spectroscopy. C-13 NMR spectra were obtained on 15 wt. % samples in TCB using a 500 MHz Varian Unity Spectometer run at 125°C as previous described [see Randall JC, Hsieh ET, NMR and Macromolecules; Sequence, Dynamic, and Domain Structure, ACS Symposium Series 247, J. C. Randall, Ed., American Chemical Society, Washington DC, 1984.]. Methyl content per 1000 carbons by NMR was obtained by multiplying (X 1000) the ratio of total methyl signals to total signal intensity.<br>
A partial least squares (PLS) calibration curve was generated using Pirouette chemometric software (Infometrix) to correlate changes in the FTIR absorption spectra with calculated or NMR measured values for methyls/1000 total carbons for the 25 samples. The FTIR absorption spectra used in the calibration model were made from co-added spectra collected across the whole sample. Only a portion of<br>
the spectral region (2996 and 2836 cm"1) was used in the calibration step in order to minimize the effects of residual solvent absorption. Preprocessing of spectral data included area normalization, taking the first derivative of the spectra and mean centering all data.<br>
A four component calibration model was calculated and optimized using the process of cross validation (RSQ=0.999, SEV=0.7). The calibration model was verified using 23 additional samples, The predicted versus actual values for the<br>
validation data showed excellent correlation (RSQ=0.987) and exhibited a root mean<br>
i<br>
square error of prediction equal to +/- 0.4 methyl groups per 1000 total carbon molecules.<br>
Short chain branching levels were calculated by subtracting out methyl chain end contributions. The amount of methyl chain ends were calculated using the equation Mece=C(2-Vce)/M, where Mece is the number of methyl chain ends per 1000 total carbon molecules, C is a constant equal to 14000, Vce is the number of vinyl terminated chain ends (1 for chromium catalyzed resins), and M is the molecular weight calculated for a particular slice of the molecular weight distribution.<br>
PENT slow crack growth resistance values were obtained at 80°C (L76°F) according to ASTM F1473 (2001), with the exception that the initial load was 3.8 MPa, in order to accelerate the test. This 3.8 MPa PENT test may be referred to herein as a "high stress" PENT test.<br>
The Charpy testing was the Razor-Notched Room-Temperature Charpy Energy test carried out according to ASTM F2231.<br>
Preparation of Cyclopentadienyl Complexes and Metallocene Compounds<br>
The cyclopentadienyl complexes and metallocenes used in the various examples or described herein were purchased or prepared as follows. All manipulations involving air-sensitive reagents and materials were performed under nitrogen by using standard Schlenk line or dry box techniques. The solvent THF was distilled from potassium, while anhydrous diethyl ether, methylene chloride, pentane, and toluene (Fisher Scientific Company) were stored over activated alumina. All solvents were degassed and stored under nitrogen. Zirconium (IV)<br>
chloride (99.5%) and n-butyllithium were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Company and were used as received. Products were analyzed by 'H NMR (300 MHz, CDC13, referenced against residual CHC13 peak at 7.24 ppm) or 13C NMR (75 MHz, CDC13, referenced against central line of CDCh at 77.00 ppm).<br>
Preparation of Sulfated Alumina Activator-Support<br>
Alumina A, from W.R. Grace Company, was impregnated to incipient wetness with an aqueous solution of ammonium sulfate. Typically, the alumina had a surface area of about 330 ntVgram and a pore volume of about 1.3 cc/gram. The amount of ammonium sulfate used was equal to 20% of the starting alumina, The volume of water used to dissolve the ammonium sulfate was calculated from the total pore volume of the starring sample (i.e. 2.6 mLs of water for each gram of alumina to be treated). Thus, a solution of about 0.08 grams of ammonium sulfate per mL of water was employed. The resulting wet sand was dried in a vacuum oven overnight at 120 °C, and then screened through a 35 mesh screen. Finally, the material was activated in a fluidizing stream of dry air at 550 °C for 3 hours, in the case of bench scale samples, or 6 hours, for the larger pilot plant samples. The samples were then stored under nitrogen.<br>

A one-liter flask is charged with 2,7-di-tert-butylfluorene (50 g, 179.6 mmol) and a stir bar, capped with a rubber septum, and placed under a nitrogen atmosphere. Diethyl ether (about 200 mL) is added via a cannula, and the resulting mixture is cooled to -78°C in a dry-ice bath. This mixture is stirred at this temperature as n-butyllithium (19.0 mL of 10 M in hexanes, 190 mmol) is added slowly via syringe. After the addition of »-butyllithium is complete, the reddish solution is slowly wanned to room temperature and stirred overnight (at least about 12 hours). After this time, the reaction mixture is cooled to -78°C, and 6-butenyl-6-methylfulvene (40 mL) is added quickly (in less than 1 minute) at this temperature with stirring. Upon completion of the fulvene addition, the mixture is removed from the dry ice bath and wanned to room temperature, and a GC aliquot is taken after ca. 15 minutes following removal of the dry-ice bath.<br>
Stirring is continued for 7 hours, after which time the reaction mixture is quenched with a saturated NHtCl/HjO solution (300 mL). The organic layer is<br>
extracted with diethyl ether, washed twice with HfeO (500 mL), dried over anhydrous Na2S04, filtered, and the filtrate evaporated to dryness to afford a solid. Methanol (ca. 500 mL) is added to the solid and the mixture stirred overnight to form the product as a finely divided white solid. After filtration, washing with MeOH, and drying overnight, the desired parent ligand 1-(methyl)-l-(3-butenyl)-l-(cyclopentadienyl)-l-(2,7-di-tert-butylfluorenyl)methane is isolated and maybe used without further purification.<br>

A one-liter flask is charged with 2,7-di-tert-butylfluorene (50 g, 179.6 mmol) and a stir bar, capped with a rubber septum, and placed under a nitrogen atmosphere. Diethyl ether (about 300 mL) is added via a cannula, and the resulting mixture is cooled to -78°C in a dry-ice bath. This mixture is stirred at this temperature as n-butyllithium (21.5 mL of 10 M in hexanes, 215 mmol) is added slowly via syringe. After the addition of H-butyllithium is complete, the reddish solution is slowly warmed to room temperature and stirred overnight (at least about 12 hours), to provide an ether solution of 2,7-di-tert-butylfiuorenyl lithium.<br>
Another one-liter flask fitted with an addition funnel is charged with 6-butenyl-6-methylfulvene (37 g, 253 mmol) and a stir bar, and cooled to 0°C under a nitrogen atmosphere. The ether solution of 2,7-di-tert-butylfluorenyl lithium prepared as above is added in a dropwise fashion to the fulvene at 0°C via the addition funnel over the course of approximately one hour. The resulting dark-colored reaction mixture is wanned to room temperature and stirred overnight (at least about 12 hours) under a nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction mixture is then quenched with the slow addition of a saturated NUfCl/HzO solution (300 mL), the organic layer extracted with ether, washed twice with E^O (500 mL), dried over anhydrous NaaSCU, filtered, and the filtrate evaporated to dryness. The crude product obtained by this method is then dissolved in pentane and maintained at about 0°C in a freezer, thereby affording the product as a white solid that is washed with cold pentane, dried under vacuum, and isolated and used without further<br>
purification. Further product could be isolated in smaller quantities through concentrating the mother liquors and combined washings and placing them back in freezer.<br>

EXAMPLE 12 Comparison of Inventive Catalysts with JncfcZrCk<br>
Various polymerization runs were conducted to demonstrate the support activity of various metallocenes of the present invention compared with the support activity of bis-indenyl zirconiumdichloride (obtained from Witco under the trade name Eurecen 5032).<br>
All laboratory polymerization runs were conducted in a one-gallon (3.785 liter) stainless steel reactor. The reactor employed an air-operated stirrer with a three bladed propeller and was set to run at 1180 rpm for the duration of a run. The reactor was also encased in a steel jacket with supply lines leading to a heat exchange unit, that was in turn connected to cooling water and a steam line, allowing for temperature control.<br>
The initiation of the charging sequence to the reactor was through an opened charge port while venting with isobutane vapor. An alkylaluminum was injected, quickly followed by addition of the solid activator and catalyst solution. The charge port was closed and 20 psi isobutane vapor added. A side vessel was utilized to hold a measured amount of hexene and this was pushed into the reactor with two liters of<br><br>
isobutane liquid backed by nitrogen pressure. The contents of the reactor were stirred and heated to 2 degrees Centigrade below the desired run temperature, and ethylene was then introduced. A mass flow unit allowed the pressure to climb quickly to 5 psi below the required run pressure, and allowed the smooth transition of ethylene flow until the specified temperature (90°C) and reactor pressure (450 psi) levels were achieved. The reactor pressure was maintained by addition of ethylene on demand. These temperature and pressure levels were maintained for the duration of the run (30 rm'n). At the completion of the run time the ethylene flow was stopped and the reactor pressure slowly vented off. When the pressure and temperature were safely low enough the reactor was opened and the granular polymer powder collected. Activity was specified as grams of polymer produced per gram of solid activator charged per hour. A summary of the various runs is presented in Table 1.<br>
Table 1.<br><br>
(Table  Removed)<br>
As shown in Table 1, inventive catalysts G (Runs 12-1 and 12-2) and H (Run 12-3), each having an indenyl with a substituent at the 1-position incorporating a terminal olefin, and a mono-substituted cyclopentadienyl, display from about 25 to about 60% higher polymerization activities (support activity) than IncfoZrCh under similar conditions (Runs 12-9 and 12-10).<br>
Additionally, polymers produced by metallocene compounds G and J, and IndaZrClz were evaluated using 13C NMR to determine the level of 1-hexene incorporation (Runs 12-1 1 to 12-15). LK^ZrCh generally is considered to be a poor comonomer incorporating catalyst. The results of the evaluation are presented Table 2 and illustrated in FIG. 3. As is evident from the data presented, there is a nearly 50% drop in 1-hexene incorporation in the polymers formed using metallocene compounds G and J compared with the polymer formed using<br>

EXAMPLE 13<br>
Pilot plant polymerizations were conducted to demonstrate the ability to use dual metallocene catalysts systems according to the present invention to form a bimodal polymer. Metallocene compound C was used to form the high molecular weight component and metallocene compound G was used to form the low molecular weight component.<br><br>
To prepare a solution of metallocene C, 2.00 g of solid metallocene C, 1-(phenyl)-1 -(3-butenyl)-1 -(cyclopentadienyl)-1 -(2,7-di-tert-butylfluorenyl)metIiane zirconium dichloride, was slunied in about 200 mL of hexene-1, followed by addition of 25 grams of neat (93%) triethylaluminum, under nitrogen. This solution was diluted with 100 to 240 grams of n-heptane and transferred to a steel vessel. Isobutane was added to obtain a total of 40 pounds of solution.<br>
To prepare a solution of metallocene G, 2.00 g of solid metallocene G was dissolved in 420 mL of toluene under nitrogen. The solution was transferred to a steel vessel. Isobutane was added to obtain a total of 40 pounds of solution.<br>
Tri-n-butylaluminum (TNBAL) (obtained from Akzo Corporation) was used as a co-catalyst. The TNBAL was obtained as a neat solution and was diluted to 10 weight percent with heptane. The cocatalyst was added in a concentration in a range of from about 8 to about 26 parts per million of the diluent in the polymerization reactor(s). To prevent static buildup in the reactor, a small amount (less than 5 ppm by weight of diluent) of a commercial antistatic agent sold as "Stadis 450" was usually added.<br>
The pilot plant polymerizations were conducted in a 23-gallon slurry loop reactor at a production rate of approximately 25 pounds of polymer per hour. Polymerization runs were carried out under continuous particle form process conditions in a loop reactor (also known as a slurry process) by contacting a metallocene solution, tri-n-butylaluminum, and a solid activator in a 300 mL stirred autoclave with continuous output to the loop reactor.<br>
The precontacting was carried out in the following manner. Tri-n-butylaluminum solution and metallocene solution were fed as separate streams into a tee upstream of the autoclave where they contacted each other. The solid activator<br><br>
(sulfated alumina) was flushed with isobutane into a tee between the aforementioned tee and the autoclave, contacting the tri-n-butylaluminum/metallocene mixture just before entering the autoclave. The isobutane flush used to transport the solid activator into the autoclave was set at a rate that would result in a residence time of approximately 25 minutes in the autoclave. The total flow from the autoclave then entered the loop reactor.<br>
Ethylene used was polymerization grade ethylene (obtained from Union Carbide Corporation) which was purified through a column of alumina and activated at 250°C (482°F) in nitrogen. 1-Hexene, when used, was polymerization grade 1-hexene (obtained from Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LP) which was purified by nitrogen purging and storage over 13x molecular sieve activated at 250°C (482°F) in nitrogen. The loop reactor was a liquid full, 15.2 cm diameter, loop reactor, having a volume of 23 gallons (87 liters). Liquid isobutane was used as the diluent. Some hydrogen was added to regulate the molecular weight of the low molecular weight component of the polymer product. The isobutane was polymerization grade isobutane (obtained from Chevron Phillips Chemical, Borger, Tex.) that was further purified by. distillation and subsequently passed through a column of alumina (activated at 250°C (482°F) in nitrogen).<br>
Reactor conditions included a pressure around 580 psi (4 MPa), and a temperature that was varied from about 90°C (194°F) to about 99°C (210°F). Also, the reactor was operated to have a residence time of about 1 hour. The solid activator was added through a 0.35 cc circulating ball-check feeder and fed to the 300mL autoclave as described above. Catalyst system concentrations in the reactor were within a range of about 1 to 2 parts per million (ppm) of the diluent in the polymerization reactor. Polymer was removed from the reactor at the rate of about 25 Ibs per hour and recovered in a flash chamber. A Vulcan dryer was used to dry the polymer under nitrogen at about 60 to about 80°C (about 40 to about 176°F).<br>
Various resins were prepared according to the above procedure. The results of the evaluation are presented in Table 3.<br>
Table 3.<br><br>
(Table  Removed)<br>
As is evident, the resins produced according to the present invention exhibit excellent high impact strength, illustrated by the 23 °C notched charpy impact.<br>
FIG. 4 presents the GPC curves for the resins produced in Run 13-1, 13-2, 13-3 and 13-4, demonstrating that a true bimodal molecular weight distribution polymer is obtained from the catalyst compositions of this invention.<br>
In sum, the present invention provides various catalyst compositions, methods for forming a catalyst composition, and resins and pipes formed by using the catalyst compositions. The catalyst composition generally includes two metallocene compounds, an activator, and a cocatalyst. The two metallocene compounds are selected such that the two metallocenes produce polymers having two distinctly different molecular weights. The metallocenes are combined with an activator-support, an organoaluminum compound, and an olefin monomer to produce a polyolefin having a bimodal molecular weight distribution. The resulting polymers have excellent impact strength. The present invention further provides novel metallocene compounds and an improved method of synthesis of half-metallocene compounds.<br>
While costly aluminoxanes and organoborates are not required by the present invention, they may be used as desired. As demonstrated by the above examples, the use of a tri-catalyst system, such as those described herein, produces polyolefin films having a desirably low haze while maintaining other physical attributes, such as dart impact.<br>
