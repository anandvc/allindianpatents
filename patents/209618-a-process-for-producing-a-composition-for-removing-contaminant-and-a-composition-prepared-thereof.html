1	METHOD OF MAKING A COMPOSITION, A PRODUCT FROM SUCH METHOD,<br>
2	AND THE USE THEREOF IN REMOVING OR DISSOLVING A CONTAMINANT<br>
3	FROM AN ENVIRONMENT<br>
4	RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
5	This application claims priority from provisional U.S. application serial number<br>
6	60/223,064 filed August 4,2000.<br>
7	BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
8	The invention relates to a method of making a composition and a product from such<br>
9	method wherein such composition is effective in reducing the concentration of a contaminant<br>
10	in an environment<br>
11	It is known that various processes used to produce printed materials such as printing<br>
12	processes and lithography processes utilize various machinery that contain several parts such<br>
13	as rollers, apparatus to contain and move fluids (such as hoses and trays), and other moving<br>
14	parts (such as gears and the like).   Such machinery becomes contaminated with various<br>
15	contaminants, such as organic deposits, calcium deposits, bacteria, fungi, and additional<br>
16	residue created from the use of various organic-based inks and printing production fluids<br>
17	known in the art Great difficulty is encountered in attempting to reduce the concentration of,<br>
10	preferably remove, such contaminants from the various parts of the machinery due, in part, to<br>
19	the difficulty in accessing the internal parts of such machinery.<br>
20	In addition, when such contaminant residue is not removed on a consistent basis, it is<br>
21	known that such residue can accumulate and harden over time creating a residue which is<br>
22	difficult to remove and can cause undesirable chemical reactions to occur in the various<br>
23	processes.   Processes used in the past to remove such residue have included mechanical<br>
24	removal that requires disassembling the machinery to access parts that contain such residue<br>
25	and then removing such residue by mechanical methods such as by hammering, chiseling, and<br>
26	the like.   Such mechanical methods require significant downtime of the machinery and<br>
1<br>
SUBSTITUTE SHEET (RULE 26)<br><br>
1	involve increased risk to the equipment and the personnel invo\ved with removing such<br>
2	residue,<br>
3	It is also known that various methods for removing such residue, other than<br>
4	mechamcal methods, usually involve the use of fluids such as various solvents and<br>
5	surfactants. However, such solvents and surfactants do not completely remove such residue.<br>
6	Further, when such solvents and surfactants do not completely remove such residue, such<br>
7	residue begins to accumulate as discussed above. Thus, a composition and process of using<br>
8	such composition for removing contaminants  from machinery such as printing and<br>
9	lithography equipment that does not require mechanical methods of removing such residue,<br><br>
10	provides for a substantially complete removal of such residue, and helps to prevent the<br>
11	accumulation of such residue, would be of significant contribution to the art and to the<br>
12	economy.<br>
^3	It is also known that various industrial processes used to produce goods utilize various<br>
14	systems, such as packaging systems, flexographic systems, food processing systems,<br>
15	bleaching systems, metallurgy systems, acid washing systems, veterinary product systems,<br>
16	pesticide systems, meat processing systems, poultry processing systems, dairy processing<br>
17	systems, sanitizing systems, and the like and combinations thereof, which contain several<br>
18	parts such as gears, rollers, and the like. Such parts can become contaminated with various<br>
19	contaminants such as organic and calcium deposits, calcium and starch-based glues, and the<br>
20	like and combinations thereof Various compositions known to reduce the concentration of,<br>
21	or remove, such contaminants utilize compositions wiiich are difBcult to dispose of due to<br>
22	environmental regulations and can present significant safety hazards. Thus, a composition,<br>
23	usefiil for removing such contaminants from such systems, which is non-toxic, easy to<br>
24	prepare, and capable of being disposed of without cosdy disposal procedures would also be of<br>
25	significant contribution to the art and to the economy.<br><br>
1	It is also known that various industrial processes used to produce goods such as paper<br>
2	and pulp products utilize various water-containing systems.  Such water-containing systems<br>
3	are also found in various printing systems, water treating systems, drainage systems, boiler<br>
4	systems, chiller systems, and the like. Use of such water-containing systems presents several<br>
5	problems relating to the fouling of such water-containing systems with various contaminants<br>
6	such as scale, algae, fungi, bacteria, surfactants, various organic compounds, and the like.<br>
7	The contaminants can fouJ such water-containing systems to such an extent that such water-<br>
8	containing systems require extensive cleaning to remove such contaminants, which results in<br>
9	a decrease in production of goods.<br>
10	Various known compositions that can be used for reducing the concentration of,<br>
11	preferably removing or dissolving, such contaminants from such water-containing systems<br>
12	frequently utilize chlorine.   However, use of such chlorine-based compositions present<br>
13	. various environmental and safety hazards and further, disposal of such products produced<br>
14	using such chlorine-based compositions requires close environmental scrutiny and regulation.<br>
15	In  addition, such chlorine-based compositions are frequently utilized in gaseous form which<br>
16	requires extensive safety and training procedures to be utilized. Thus, a composition, useful<br>
17	for removing or dissolving one or more contaminants from an environment that contains<br>
18	water-based systems, which is non-toxic, inexpensive, and easy to prepare and use would be<br>
19	of significant value to the art and to the economy.<br>
20	In addition, compositions,  useful in reducing the concentration of,  preferably<br>
21	removing or dissolving, contaminants from an environment, which contain more than one<br>
22	component commonly require one of the components to be added to the environment first,<br>
23	followed by the addition of a second component The two components must then react "in<br>
24	situ" to thereby provide a composition that can remove or dissolve the contaminants<br>
25	contained within the environment-   Such compositions can be difficult to use due to the<br><br>
26	difficulty in determining how much of each component of the composition should be added.<br>
27	Thus, a composition useful in reducing the concentration of, preferably removing or<br>
28	dissolving, contaminants from an environment and that can be prepared "ex situ" in various<br>
29	concentrations,  which can then be added to an environment to remove  or dissolve<br>
30	contaminants would be of significant contribution to the art and to the economy.<br>
6	In addition, a composition useful in reducing the concentration of, preferably<br>
7	removing or dissolving, contaminants from an environment which is prepared from easily<br>
8	accessible components and which can be prepared by a simple procedure utilizing a minimum<br>
9	of preparation apparatus would also be of significant contribution to the art and to the<br>
10	economy.<br>

1	DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF TBE INVENTION<br>
2	It has been discovered that the performance of a composition when reducing the<br>
3	concentration of, preferably removing or dissolving, one or more contaminants from an<br>
4	environment can be improved by utilizing a novel process of preparing such composition<br>
5	which comprises contacting hydrogen peroxide and glycolic acid.<br>
6	Generally, a process of preparing a composition of the present invention comprises<br>
7	contacting hydrogen peroxide, glycolic acid, and water. The hydrogen peroxide is generally<br>
8	present as a hydrogen peroxide solution comprising hydrogen peroxide and water.   Such<br>
9	hydrogen peroxide solution generally comprises at least about 0.1 weight percent hydrogen<br><br>
10	peroxide in water and at most about 20 weight percent hydrogen peroxide in water, preferably<br>
11	at least about 0.5 weight percent hydrogen peroxide in water and at most about 15 weight<br>
12	percent hydrogen peroxide in water, and more preferably at least about 1 weight percent<br>
13	hydrogen peroxide in water and at most about 15 weight percent hydrogen peroxide in wafer.<br>
14	An example hydrogen peroxide solution which can be used in a process of the present<br>
15	invention can be prepared by adding a stabilising amount of water to a commercially<br>
18	available 35 weight percent technical grade solution of hydrogen peroxide in water from FMC<br>
17	Corporation, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to thereby obtain a hydrogen peroxide solution<br>
18	suitable for use in a process of the present invention.<br>
19	The water suitable for use in a process of the present invention is preferably a low<br>
20	solids water generally comprising less than about 10 parts per million (ppm) dissolved solids,<br>
21	preferably less than about 5 ppm dissolved solids, more preferably less than about 1 ppm<br>
22	dissolved solids, and most preferably about 0 ppm dissolved solids. An example low solids<br>
23	water which can be used in a process of the present invention can be obtained commercially<br>
24	from PGT Inc., Cedar Hill, Texas, which is a low solids water produced by reverse osmosis<br>
25	having less than about 0.1 ppm dissolved solids.<br><br>
1	The water, preferably low solids water, can be prepared by any suitable means known<br>
2	in the art for preparing water which can be used in a process of the present invention.<br>
3	Generally, the low solids water can be prepared by subjecting a high solids water to a treating<br>
4	means selected from the group consistmg of reverse osmosis, deionization, and the like and<br>
5	combinations thereof The high solids water generally comprises more dissolved solids than<br>
6	the low solids water. Generally, the high solids water comprises more than about 200 ppm of<br>
7	dissolved solids.<br>
8	Generally, water is present in a stabilizing amount which allows for the contacting of<br>
9	hydrogen peroxide and glycolic acid according a process as described herein.   Generally, a<br>
10	stabilizing amount of water as described herein should be large enough to prevent an<br>
11	imcontrollable or unpredictable reaction between the hydrogen peroxide and glycolic acid<br>
12	which can occur in a non-dilute environment as known in the art  However, a stabilizing<br>
13	amount of water as described herein should be small enough to prevent the resulting<br>
14	composition from being so dilute that such resulting composition no longer has the ability to<br>
15	reduce the concentration ofi preferably remove or dissolve, a contaminant from an<br>
16	environment as described herein.   Thxis, a novel aspect of the present invention is the<br>
17	presence of a stabilizing amount of water, preferably low solids water, ^^^ch is large enough<br>
18	to allow the contacting of such hydrogen peroxide and glycolic acid in a predictable and<br>
19	controllable nianner, yet, is small enough to prevent a significant dilution of the resulting<br>
20	composition so that such composition js effective in reducing the concentration of, preferably<br>
21	removing or dissolving, a contaminant from an environment as described herein.<br>
22	Generally, a stabilizing amount of water, preferably low solids water, is present in an<br>
23	amount of at least about 50 percent by weight water based on the total weight of the hydrogen<br>
24	peroxide, glycolic acid, and water, and at most about 99.9 percent by weight water based on<br>
25	the total weight of the hydrogen peroxide, glycolic acid, and water. Preferably, a stabilizing<br><br>

11	preferably comprises at least about 1 weight percent glycolic acid and at most about 5 weight<br>
12	percent glycolic acid. An example glycolic acid solution which can be used in a process of<br>
13	the present invention can be obtained by adding low solids water as described herein to a<br>
14	commercially available 70 weight percent technical grade solution of glycolic acid obtained<br>
15	from DuPont Chemical, Wilmington, Delaware, to thereby obtain a 5 weight percent glycolic<br>
16	acid solution.<br>

27	contain mold, fungi spores and bacteria which are commonly found in the wood used to<br>
28	produce such paper products.<br>
4	A composition of the present invention can be used to reduce the concentration of,<br>
5	preferably remove or dissolve, an adhesive.   In various processes, such as the process of<br>
6	manufacturing corrugated boxes and packaging, jglues and adhesives containing organic<br>
7	compounds and starches are commonly used, A composition of the present invention can be<br>
8	contacted, such as by spraying, with such glues and adhesives and, after a time period<br>
9	effective for allowing a composition of the present invention to penetrate such glues and<br>
10	adhesives, can thus provide for easy removal of such glues and adhesives.<br>
11	A composition of the present invention can be used to treat anilox rolls, particularly<br>
12	the cells contained by, or within, such anilox rolls, commonly found in flexographic<br>

a	The following examples are presented to further illustrate this invention and are not to<br>
9	be construed as unduly limiting the scope of this invention.<br>
10<br>
It	EXAMPLE I<br>
12	This example illustrates a preparation of a composition of the present invention.<br>
13	A 55-gallon quantity of a   composition of the present invention was prepared by<br><br>
14	mixing 8.25 gallons of 35 weight percent hydrogen peroxide solution (obtained from FMC<br>
15	Corporation, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as a 35 weight percent technical grade solution of<br>
16	hydrogen peroxide in water) with 34.675 gallons of low solids water comprising less than<br>
17	about 0.1 ppm dissolved solids (obtained from PGT Inc., Cedar Hill, Texas, the low solids<br>
18	water had been produced by reverse osmosis) at room temperature (about 70°F) and<br>
19	atmospheric pressure to thereby provide a resulting mixture. Total mixing time was about 15<br>
20	minutes. The resulting mixture was then contacted with 11.55 gallons of a 5 weight percent<br>
21	glycolic acid solution which had been prepared by contacting 0.825 gallons of approximately<br>
22	70 weight percent glycolic acid solution (obtained from DuPont Chemical, Wilmington,<br>
23	Delaware, as a 70 weight percent technical grade solution of glycolic acid in water) with<br><br>
24	10.725 gallons of low solids water comprising less than about 0.1 ppm dissolved solids<br>
25	(obtained from PGT Inc., the low solids water had been produced by reverse osmosis) at<br><br>
26	room temperature (about 70oF) and atmospheric pressure to thereby obtain about 55 gallons<br>
27	of a composition of the present invention referred to herein as "Composition A" having a pH<br>
28	of about 33.<br>
5	EXAMPLE II<br>
6	This example  illustrates the use of a composition of the present invention<br>
7	(Composition A as described herein) to reduce the concentration of, preferably remove or<br>
a	dissolve, calciimi and/or starch glues and substances from corrugating equipment used in<br>
9	manufacturing corrugated boxes.<br>
10	Equipment was obtained from Packaging Corporation of America (PCA) located in<br>
11	Waco, Texas and had been in use for several years.  A significant amount of glue residue<br>
12	(color of such residue was a dirty-white due to the glue drying to a semi-translucent<br>
13	appearance over time) was observed. A significant concentration of glue residue was located<br>
14	on a cross-member of the adhesive application device of such equipment about 10 inches<br>
15	under the glue applicator which applied the glue to the web paperboard to form a corrugated<br>
16	box sheet   The glue residue level had accumulated to such an extent that production<br>
17	problems were encountered. PCA had requested assistance from several chemical companies IS	to develop a product which would remove or allow removal ef the glue residue. It is believed<br><br>
19	that twenty unsuccessful attempts were made by the various chemical vendor companies to do<br>
20	so.   Composition A was then applied directly to the glue residue using a trigger sprayer<br>
21	Within about 5 minutes, the semi-translucent appearance of the glue residue turned to a white<br>
22	color as such glue residue originally appeared (i.e., the appearance of the glue before it dried).<br>
23	Layer by layer the accumulated glue residue turned white.   Within about 20 minutes, the<br>
24	layers of residue were all visibly re-hydrated and could be removed by hand by peeling each<br>
25	layer from the cross-member.   When Composition A reached the bottom layer of residue<br><br>
26	which had been estimated as having initially fonned over 20 years prior, such bottom layer<br>
27	was able to be removed which enabled the equipment to be operated again.    Overall,<br>
28	maintenance problems for the equipment based on glue residue was minimized.  Before the<br>
29	application of Composition A, the preferred and possibly only means to remove this residue<br>
30	was with a hammer and chisel. The hammer and chisel were used to chisel the layers away<br>
31	from the cross-member section of the adhesive application device.<br>
8	EXAMPLE III<br>
9	This example illustrates another use of a composition of the present invention<br>
10	(Composition A as described herein) to remove organic substances and mineral residue from<br>
11	equipment such as anilox rolls used in flexography processes.<br>
12	Equipment utilizing anilox rolls was provided by Packaging Corporation of America<br>
13	(PCA) located in Waco, Texas.   Such equipment had been used for several years.   An<br>
14	inherent problem which exists in flexography processes is various contaminants have a 13	tendency to accumulate and bond to small laser-etched cells within the anilox rolls.  These<br><br>
16	cells supply water and solvent-based flexography inks to the raised image photo-polymer<br>
17	printing plate. After removal of excess flexography inks, there are multiple procedures used<br>
18	to remove sealants and residue from the anilox rolls. The anilox rolls of the PCA equipment<br>
19	had various mineral and ink component deposits which could not be easily removed by<br>
20	previous methods, such as baking soda blasting and using ultrasound equipment<br>
21	In a first method. Composition A was sprayed directly onto the surface of the anilox<br>
22	roll cells having a concentration of 145 cells per linear inch of anilox roll. The anilox roll<br>
23	was hydrated with Composition A and remained hydrated for about 5 minutes. Thereafter, a<br>
24	standard aqueous-based flexographic wash was used to rinse the contamination out of the<br>
25	cells. The application of Composition A appeared to decompose the bonded minerals and<br><br>
26	deposits, allowing such bonded minerals and deposits to be removed by washing with nonnal<br>
27	alkaline types of flexography wash. This process allowed for recovery of cell depth and cell<br>
28	volume of the anilox rolls. Composition A allowed for the anilox equipment to be cleaned on<br>
29	press, without the costly purchase of cleaning equipment, which provided a reduction in<br>
30	down-time and capital expenditure costs for PGA.<br>
6	The second method of applying Composition A was by adding Composition A to the<br>
7	flexography printing unit ink reservoir contacting the ink pump. The contact time was about<br>
8	five  minutes   followed by rinsing  using  standard  aqueous-based  flexographic   wash<br>
9	procedures.    Previously, methods such as baking soda blasting and using ultrasound<br><br>
10	equipment were utilized,, but had only cleaned the surface of the anilox cells. Composition A<br>
11	performed better than such previous methods and opened the cells to a like-new condition.<br>
12<br>
13	EXAMPLE IV<br>
14	This example illustrates another preparation of a composition of the present invention.<br>
15	A 55-gallon quantity of a   compositioa of the present invention was prepared by<br><br>
16	mixing 18.15 gallons of a 35 weight percent hydrogen peroxide solution (obtained from FMC<br>
17	Corporation, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as a 35 weight percent technical grade solution of<br>
18	hydrogen peroxide in water) with 13.75 gallons of low solids water comprising less than<br>
19	about 0.1 ppm dissolved soUds (obtained from PGT Inc., Cedar Hill, Texas, the low solids<br>
20	water had been produced by reverse osmosis) at room temperature (about 70oF) and<br>
21	atmospheric pressure to thereby provide a resulting mixture. Total miving time was about 15<br>
22	minutes. The resulting mixture was then contacted with 23.1 gallons of a 5 weight percent<br>
23	glycolic acid solution which had been prepared by contacting 1.65 gallons of 70 weight<br>
24	percent glycolic acid solution (obtained from DuPont Chemical, Wilmington, Delaware, as a<br>
25	70 weight percent technical grade solution of glycolic acid in water) with 21.45 gallons of<br><br>
26	low solids water comprising less than about 0.1 ppm dissolved solids (obtained from PGT<br>
27	Inc., Cedar Hill, Texas, the low solids water had been produced by reverse osmosis) at room<br>
3	temperature (about 70oF) and atmospheric pressure to thereby obtain about 55 gallons of a<br>
4.	composition of the present invention referred to herein as "Composition B" having a pH of<br>
5	about 2.2.<br>
7	EXAMPLE V<br>
6	This example illustrates a use of a composition of the present invention (Composition<br>
9	B as described herein) to remove residue and bacterial growth and fungi from a printing press<br>
10	fountain solution recirculating system (a water-containing system).<br>
11	A printing press was obtained from Rock Term Company, Waxahachie, Texas, and<br>
12	contained a Man Roland fountain solution recirculating system, also referred to as a<br>
13	dampening system, which comprised a blender, chiller, and recirculating unit containing an u	approximately 30 gallon reservoir with a total capacity of 200 gallons of water.    The<br><br>
15	equipment has been used almost continuously for about 20 years.  A significant amount of<br>
16	mineral substance residue, such as mineral deposits consisting of calcium and lime deposits,<br>
17	and bacterial and fungi growth was observed, including hair algae, which were white, green;<br>
18	brown and various other colors which are common to the mdustry. Various solvents had been<br>
19	used in an attempt to remove the residue and growth before such residue had accumulated and<br>
20	caused production interruptions. Common industry products used for cleaning such printing<br>
21	press recirculating systems included products comprising a mixture of sodium hydroxide,<br>
22	glycol ethers, and various biocides, such as those sold by various chemical manufacturers,<br>
23	including Vam International (a worldwide chemical manufacturer which manufactures<br>
24	pressroom and printing chemicals and distributes such products throughout the world).<br><br>
1	However, use of such solvents was unsuccessful in removing the mineral residue and<br>
2	bacterial and fungal growth. The mineral residue and growth had accumulated to a point that<br>
3	such had become hardened within the water lines and could not be removed. The lines had<br>
4	become plugged, making production difficult   An additional option of replacing the water<br>
5	lines and/or flushing the water system with bleach would have been an option, but the amount<br>
6	of water which would have to be consumed would have amounted to thousands of gallons of<br>
7	water. In addition, production-related issues resulting from bleach residue would have been<br>
8	difficult to alleviate, making the bleaching option undesirable and economically unfeasible.<br>
9	A five-gallon quantity of Composition B described herein was supplied for the<br>
*<br>
10	following procedure. Composition B was poured directly, in one-pint quantities, into each of<br>
11	the six water trays of the recirculating system.   Upon contact of Composition B with the<br>
12	mineral residue and bacterial and algae growth, it was observed that within about 15 to 30<br>
13	seconds, water immediately began flowing in the return line from the press back to the<br>
14	recirculating system indicating that Composition B was removing the various contaminants.<br>
15	Then, the drain of the recirculating system became unplugged so that water could easily flow.<br>
16	An additional four-gallon quantity of Composition B was then added directly to the 30-gallon<br>
17	reservoir. Within about 15 to 30 seconds, water immediately began flowing in the return line<br>
18	from the press back to the reservoir indicating that Composition B was removing the various<br>
19	contaminants. It was observed that the substance being removed by Composition B contained<br>
20	paper dust, slime, fungus, algae, mk components, and the like.  About 35 gallons of such<br>
21	substance were collected in an empty barrel. In about 30 minuites about 200 gallons of fresh<br>
22	water were passed through the water system to further help remove the debris and remains of<br>
23	dead algae and bacterial growth and minerals which had been dislodged and/or dissolved by<br>
24	Composition B.<br><br>
1	The recirculating system was then recharged with a standard fountain solution having<br>
2	a pH of about 3.8.   The press was immediately placed into production.   Normal startup<br>
3	recovery time had previously been about 20 to 25 printed sheets before production. After use<br>
4	of Composition B, startup recovery time was about 2 to 3 sheets. It is believed that the better<br>
5	startup was because the pH of Composition B was at or near the recommended pH of the<br>
6	fountain solution. Before use of Composition B, products previously used comprised sodium<br>
7	hydroxide, glycol ethers and biocides, with some of these products containing foaming agents a	or alkalines such as caustic soda. The residual pH left in the water system after using 9	traditional cleaning products would normally be m a range of about 9 to about 10.5,  Thus,<br><br>
10	since the pH of fountain solutions is typically in a range of about 3.8 to about 4.0 and since<br>
11	Compsition B has a similar residual pH, use of Composition B provides a direct benefit to<br>
12	production ability, print quality, and reduction of water costs.<br>
13	"<br>
14	EXAMPLE VI<br>
16	This example illustrates a use of a composition of the present invention (Composition<br>
16	B as described herein) to remove a contaminant from a swimming pool.<br>
17	The test site consisted of a swimming pool which contained 25,000 gallons of water<br>
18	which was substantially firee of chlorine and other chemical substances. The swimming pool<br>
19	was rectangular in shape with a shallow end depth of approximately three feet and a deep end<br>
20	depth of approximately nine feet  The swimming pool had been covered and dominant for<br>
21	about nine months.  Before treatment, the water appeared blackish in color and emitted a<br>
22	strong foul odor. The surface areas of the pool under water were covered with a green algae<br>
23	growth which was about 1.5 inches thick.   The green algae growth appeared to cover an<br>
24	underlying gray-colored algae-type substance. Due to the extensive algae growth, the bottom<br>
25	surface of the pool and the surfaces of the first and second steps of the pool were not visible.<br><br>
26	The filter media contained in the swimming pool filtration system was diametaceous earth.<br>
27	The pH of the water was 12 and the temperature of the water was about 78oF.<br>
3	A ten-gallon quantity of Composition B described herein was then added to the pool<br>
4	by pouring Composition B at a steady rate into the pool from a plastic bucket while walking<br>
5	around the edges of the pool from the shallow to the deep end. After approximately twenty-<br>
6	five minutes, the color of the water turned to a light green "pea-soup" color. Debris began to<br>
7	float to the top and such debris appeared to be large pieces of the green algae and gray-<br>
8	colored algae-type substance.    The clarity of the water continued to improve.    After<br>
9	approximately twenty-four hours, the water appeared to be somewhat cloudy or "milky" in<br><br>
10	color. The green algae and gray-colored algae-type substance appeared to have been "killed"<br>
11	with the remains of such algae appearing as a white skeletal debris which covered the bottom<br>
12	of the pool with some of the debris floating on top. The pH of the pool was 6.8. A flocculent<br>
13	was then added in an amount of about two fluid quarts to aid in the removal of the floating<br>
14	debris.   After approximately seventy-two hours from the addition of Composition B, the<br>
15	bottom of the pool was vacuumed and the vacuumed debris was exhausted into an area next<br>
16	to the pool. The pH of the pool was 6.8. Tap water was then added to the pool until the pH<br>
17	of the pool water was 7.0.<br>
18	      The pool water remained uncovered, dormant, and was not circulated for two weeks.<br>
19	After the two-week period, the dissolved oxygen (DO) was 106 parts per million (ppm), the<br>
20	water appeared to very clear (the bottom surface of the deep end was visible), and the pump<br>
21	used to circulate the pool water was started and set to circulate the pool water for two hours<br>
22	each day. One week later (three weeks total time from the addition of Composition B), which<br>
23	included a two-inch rain, the DO was 98 ppm. After one more week (four weeks total time<br>
24	from the addition of Composition B), the DO was 44 ppm.  The water was still clear, but<br><br>
25	several small areas of green algae growth on the surface areas of the pool underwater were<br>
26	observed<br>
3	A 2.5 gallon "maintenance dose" of Composition B described herein was then added<br>
4	to the pool by pouring from a plastic bucket at one end of the pool After adding, the DO was<br>
5	100 ppm (which was the desired reading) and the pH was 7.4. The pool was then maintained<br>
6	at a dosage rate of 2,5 gallons of Composition B added every two weeks.<br>
8	EXAMPLE VII<br>
9	This example demonstrates the effect of various increases in concentration of a<br>
10	composition of the present invention.<br>
11	Two test sites (1 and 2) were utilized to detennine the toxicity of a composition of the<br>
12	present invention.   Test site 1 consisted of an outdoor water garden comprising a circular-<br>
13	shaped fiberglass molded tank having a diameter of about 5 feet and   which contained<br>
14	approximately 500 gallons of water. The tank also contained soil, rock, several bricks, and 36<br>
15	minnows. The water was foul-smelling and black in color, A substance which appeared to<br>
16	be a black mold or algae covered the soil and rocks at the bottom of the tank.<br>
17	An eight fluid ounce quantity of Composition B described herein was then<br>
13	added to the tank by pouring Composition B directly from a plastic bottle into the water at<br>
19	one end of the tank , The temperature of the water during addition was about 78°F- Upon<br>
20	addition, the water immediately began to bubble. The bubbling began on one end of the tank<br>
21	and proceeded to the other end of the tank within about 15 minutes.   After 24 hours had<br>
22	elapsed, the water appeared to be clear and the bricks and rock contained within the tank were<br>
23	completely visible and were no longer covered with the black mold or algae. The minnows<br>
24	appeared to be unaffected by the addition of Composition B.   Skeletal debris appeared to<br>
25	cover the bottom of the tank. A pH reading and dissolved oxygen reading were not obtained.<br><br>
26	Based on the observations, a recommended dosage rate of eight ounces of Composition B<br>
27	applied every two to three weeks was developed,<br>
3	Test site 2 consisted of a standard 29-gallon aquarium containing six gallons of<br>
4	crushed coral gravel.  To such aquarium was charged 29 gallons of reverse osmosis treated<br>
5	water.  The pH was 8.0, The growth medium used in the tank included a General Electric<br>
6	brand Gro-Lite bulb (which had a UV spectrum similar to sunlight) and TETRA-MIN tropical<br>
7	fish food The water was allowed to cycle through the aquarium for about five days without<br>
8	the addition of any chemicals, live fish, or plants.   After five days, twenty-four small bait<br>
9	shop minnows were added to the water and left alone for about two days (about 48 hours).<br><br>
10	Then, Composition B was added in an amount of  100 parts Composition B by weight per<br>
11	million parts water (i.e., 100 ppm).  About thirty minutes after such addition, the dissolved<br>
12	oxygen level was 106 ppm-<br>
13	After twenty-four hours, the dissolved oxygen level was about 44 ppm and an<br>
u	additional 200 ppm amount of Composition B was added. After thirty minutes, the dissolved<br>
15	oxygen was about 210 ppm. The minnows were observed to be swimming near the bottom<br>
16	of the tank- After an additional twenty-four hours, the dissolved oxygen was 86 ppm. An<br>
17	additional 500 ppm amount of Composition B was then added Thereafter, a reading for the<br>
18	dissolved oxygen could not be obtained because the dissolved oxygen was so high that the 15	titration medium being used (sodium thiosulfate) kept turning black which prevented an<br><br>
20	accurate dissolved oxygen reading from being obtained Even after six hours had passed and<br>
21	over 600 ppm of sodium thiosulfate had been  used, a dissolved oxygen reading still could not<br>
22	be obtained<br>
23	No additional chemicals were added to the tank for a period of four days. After ten<br>
24	days had passed from the initial application of Composition B, the fish present in the tank<br>
25	began to expire at a rate of about one fish per day over the next two weeks. The scales of<br><br>
26	about three of the fish appeared to be expanded away from the. bodies of such fish. After four<br>
27	weeks had passed since the initial application of Composition B to the tank, the water was<br>
28	still very clear and free of algae growth. The dissolved oxygen was 44 ppm.<br>
4	The results shown in the above examples clearly demonstrate that the present<br>
5	invention is well adapted to cany out the objects and attain the ends and advantages<br>
6	mentioned as well as those inherent therein.<br>
7	Reasonable variations, modifications, and adaptations can be made within the scope<br>
8	of the disclosure and the appended claims without departing from the scope of this i<br><br><br>
