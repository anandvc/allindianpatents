				<td>METHOD OF PROVIDING BACKGROUND SOUNP_FROM PERSONAL PORTABLE<br>
TERMINAL DURING COMMUNICATION<br>
5<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a method of<br>
providing music or sound effects as a background sound from<br>
a personal portable terminal during voice communication<br>
10between a calling terminal and a receiving terminal, in<br>
which a background sound source can be downloaded from a<br>
background sound provider and stored in the personal<br>
portable terminal.<br>
15Backgxound Art<br>
In general, a background sound service during<br>
communication can be described by a communication service<br>
where background music or sound effect is delivered while<br>
voice-communicating between a calling terminal and a<br>
20receiving terminal through a wire or wireless communication<br>
network. For example, a conventional background sound<br>
service is provided from a background sound provider<br>
connected to a mobile switching center (MSC), which manages<br>
calling and receiving terminals within the mobile<br>
25communication network. Due to tremendous advance in<br>
electronics and communication technologies, recently,<br>
miniaturized and high-performance wire or wireless<br>
terminals have been widely spread and popularised. In<br>
concert with these communication environments, various<br>
30background music services for a wire or wireless terminal<br>
have been proposed. One of them is exemplified by Korean<br>
Patent Publication No. 2002-85579 entitled "A method of<br>
transmitting a background music during communication of<br>
mobile Communication terminals."<br><br>
2<br>
FIG. 1 is a flow chart illustrating a conventional<br>
background music delivery operation during the<br>
communication between mobile communication terminals.<br>
Specifically, FIG. 1 illustrates procedures of transmitting<br>
5a background music, simultaneously while voice-<br>
communicating using the mobile communication terminals.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, the central processing unit<br>
equipped in the mobile communication terminal displays a<br>
phone number selection window in the display unit in order<br>
10 for the users to select a phone number(s), to which they<br>
want to transmit a background music while communicating<br>
therewith {step 101}. At this time, the user can select an<br>
individual phone number or a group of phone numbers, to<br>
which the selected background music is to be transmitted.<br>
15Furthermore, the background music to be added during<br>
communication can be selected, dependisvg on the<br>
communication time and the number of communications (step<br>
103) .<br>
After selecting the phone number, the central<br>
20processing unit retrieves background music stored in the<br>
memory unit and provides a music selection window in the<br>
display unit where the retrieved music is displayed so as<br>
to be selected by the user. At this time, the user can<br>
select the displayed background music from the music<br>
25selection window correspondingly to the selected phone<br>
number or group. Then, the central processing unit stores<br>
the phone number or group selected at the step 101 and the<br>
background music selected at the step 103 correspondingly<br>
to each phone number or group (step 105) such that, while<br>
30communicating with the selected phone number or group, the<br>
corresponding background music can be output to a speaker<br>
unit.<br>
Thereafter, the user transmits a connection-request<br>
signal to a counterpart terminal using a key input unit, or<br><br>
5                                                                         3<br>
receives a connection-request signal from the counterpart<br>
terminal (step 107). At this time, the central processing<br>
unit determines whether a communication channel is to be<br>
established, according to the signal generated by the<br>
Soperation of the key-input unit. As the result of<br>
determination, if a communication channel is established,<br>
the central processing unit retrieves the memory unit to<br>
make a decision as to whether it has a background music<br>
corresponding to the outgoing or incoming phone number,<br>
10with which the user wants to communicate (step 109). As<br>
the result of the operation in the step 109, if a<br>
corresponding background music exists, the central<br>
processing unit determines if an input signal is received<br>
for using the stored background music with respect to the<br>
15outgoing or incoming phone number (step 111).<br>
As the result of determination at the step 111, if<br>
there exists an input signal for using the established<br>
background music, first the signal-processing unit carries<br>
out voice-coding of the background music transferred from<br>
20the central processing unit (step 113). After that, the<br>
voice-coded background music is transmitted to the<br>
counterpart terminal, along with voice 3ignal (step 115).<br>
Consequently, when start to communicate with the<br>
counterpart terminal, the background music can be output to<br>
25the speaker unit (step 117).<br>
On the other hand, if the result of the determination<br>
at the above described steps 109 and 111 is negative, i.e.,<br>
there does not exist a background music or an input signal,<br>
the central processing unit allows a voice signal only to<br>
30be transmitted to the counterpart tecminal so that a voice<br>
communication can be carried out, without background music<br>
(step 119).<br>
As described above, the conventional background sound<br>
service is designed such that a background sound is set up<br><br>
4<br>
correspondingly to a calling or receiving number and the<br>
established background sound is output onto the<br>
communication channel between the calling and receiving<br>
terminals. Therefore, the service users can listen to the<br>
5backcground music, while voice-communicating with one<br>
another.<br>
According to the above-described conventional<br>
technique, however, a background sound source is built-in<br>
or stored in a mobile communication terminal or personal<br>
10portable terminal by terminal manufacturers, and thus users<br>
can transmits only the stored or built-in background sound<br>
onto the communication channel, when they start to<br>
communicate using their terminals. Therefore, the users,<br>
while communicating, can not change and control the<br>
15background music or sound effects, so that it can not<br>
readily realize a unique communication associating a<br>
personality or individuality.<br>
Furthermore, with the conventional terminal providing<br>
a background sound service, the user can not stop the<br>
20transmission of background sound, restart the transmission,<br>
or adjust the volume of background sound, without<br>
intermitting the voice-communication. Therefore, the<br>
communications between the terminal users may be spoiled or<br>
disturbed due to the uncontrollable background sound since<br>
25the calling party can not consider any circumstances of the<br>
teceiving party while communicating.<br>
In addition, the users can use only the background<br>
sound source stored in the conventional communication<br>
terminal, and can not readily update the stored or built-in<br>
30background sound source.<br>

Referring to the accompanying drawings, the preferred<br>
embodiments according to the present invention are<br>
hereafter described in detail. It is noted that the<br><br>
9<br>
following description of preferred embodiments and the<br>
features depicted in the drawings are illustrative of the<br>
present invention and is not to be construed as limiting<br>
the invention. It is also noted that details on the well-<br>
5known elements and their functions will not be described so<br>
as not to avoid any possibility of obscuring the gist of<br>
the present invention.<br>
FIG. 2 schematically shows the configuration of a<br>
wire or wireless communication network where a background<br>
10sound providing service according to the present invention<br>
can be applied<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, the wire or wireless<br>
communication network 200 is composed of a user terminal<br>
such as a personal computer 204, a wire telephone 206 or a<br>
15personal portable terminal 208, and a wire or wireless<br>
communication service unit such as WEB, WAP, automatic<br>
response service (ARS) unit or the like. As shown in FIG.<br>
1, a background sound providing service unit 202 according<br>
to the invention is provided to the wire or wireless<br>
20communication network 200. According to one embodiment of<br>
the invention, the user terminals 204, 206 or 208, which<br>
may need a background sound service, are able to be<br>
connected to the background sound providing service unit<br>
202 through the wire or wireless communication network 200.<br>
25Hereinafter, the background sound providing service unit<br>
202 will be referred to as a "BSPS unit."<br>
In this embodiment, the BSPS unit 202 includes a<br>
database, in which background sound source files are<br>
stored. In addition, the BSPS unit 202 is configured such<br>
30that a user can be connected thereto through a computer<br>
communication service or an Internet service. That is, the<br>
user terminals may be connected to the BSPS unit 202<br>
through any private Internet service provider or on-line<br>
service provider, which is connected to the wire or<br><br>
10<br>
wireless communication network 200. Furthermore, the<br>
personal portable terminal 208 may download the background<br>
sound source files through a wireless Internet service.<br>
The background sound source file includes an audio file,<br>
5which is transmittable or receivable between computer<br>
devices.<br>
For the purpose of the download service of the<br>
background sound source according to the present invention,<br>
the background sound source is made in the form of source<br>
10files by using various audio data, and the background sound<br>
source files are stored in a database provided in the BSPS<br>
unit 202. The background sound source includes a variety<br>
of sound source files, which are suitable for various types<br>
of user terminal.<br>
15 In the case where a user wants to download a<br>
background sound source file using his or her portable<br>
terminal 208, first the user connects his or her terminal<br>
to the BSPS unit 202 through the wire or wireless<br>
communication network 200. Then, when the personal<br>
20portable terminal 208 is connected to the BSPS unit 202,<br>
the unit transmits the list of background sound source<br>
files to the connected terminal 208. By using his or her<br>
terminal, the user can listen to any background sound<br>
selected from the transmitted list before downloading, so<br>
25that only desired background sound source files, for<br>
example his favorite or agreeable sounds, can be downloaded<br>
and stored in the personal portable terminal 208.<br>
Afterwards, the stored background sound source files can be<br>
used as a background sound source when communicating with<br>
30others.<br>
As describe above, in this embodiment, the list of<br>
background sounds stored in the BSPS unit is transmitted to<br>
the user portable terminal, and the user downloads a<br>
desired background sound source filet(s) selectively from<br><br>
11<br>
the transmitted list, and stores them in his personal<br>
portable terminal. The user can set a predetermined dial<br>
key to a specific background sound such that he can select,<br>
by one-touch key operation, a desired, background sound to<br>
5be transmitted to a receiving party, along with voice<br>
signal. Similarly, a receiving party may send to a calling<br>
terminal a background sound stored in his portable terminal<br>
in the same way.<br>
In other words, this embodiment of the invention is<br>
10carrried out by the following three staps. The fixst step<br>
comprises sub-steps of pre-listening backgxound sounds<br>
stored in the BSPS unit, selecting and downloading a<br>
desired background sound source file(s), and storing them<br>
in the user's personal portable terminal. The second step<br>
15includes sub-steps of outputting the scored background<br>
sound source files and listening them again in order to<br>
find out the characteristics of each background sound, and<br>
establishing a dial-key operation, for example, in order to<br>
control the execution and intermission of the background<br>
20sound transmission, and the adjustment of the output level,<br>
or the like. In the final third step, a calling or<br>
receiving party sends the background sound stored in his<br>
personal portable terminal in real-time to the counterpart,<br>
together with a voice signal, while communicating with each<br>
25other.<br>
FIG. 3 is a flow chart explaining a procedure of<br>
downloading the background sound source files according to<br>
one embodiment of the invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, the BSPS unit 202 determines<br>
30whether a user' terminal is connected therewith to download<br>
the background sound source (step 300). As the result of<br>
the determination, if connected, the BSPS unit 202<br>
transmits the list of background sound source files stored<br>
therein to the connected user, i.e., the connected personal<br><br>
12<br>
portable terminal (step 302). Then, the BSPS unit 202<br>
determines whether a selection input signal corresponding<br>
to a particular background sound is received from the<br>
connected personal portable terminal (step 304).<br>
5 On the other hand, the list of background sound<br>
source files transmitted at the step 302 can be displayed<br>
on a personal computer monitor or a display unit of<br>
personal, portable terminal in the same Way as in the<br>
general computer communication. At this time, the user may<br>
10select and pre-listen to a particular background sound from<br>
the transmitted list (step 306). When the BSPS unit 202<br>
receives a pre-listening request signal from the connected<br>
personal portable terminal, the unit executes the selected<br>
background sound source file such that the connected user<br>
15can listen through a loud speaker of his or her own<br>
portable terminal (step 308). At this time, if the user<br>
does not like the executed background sound, he can select<br>
and pre-listen to another background sound.<br>
Thereafter, the user requests downloading of a<br>
20selected or pre-listened background sound source file.<br>
I.e., the BSPS unit 202 determines whether a download<br>
request signal is received from the user portable terminal<br>
(step 310). As the result of the determination, if the<br>
download request signal is received, responding to the<br>
25download request signal the BSPS unit 202 asks the<br>
telephone number of a personal portable terminal to which<br>
the requested background sound source file is to be<br>
transmitted. After that, the BSPS unit 202 receives from<br>
the user portable terminal an input signal of the telephone<br>
30number or ID for identifying a personal portable terminal,<br>
to which the reguested source file is to be transmitted and<br>
downloaded (step 312).<br>
In order to transmit a background sound source file,<br>
first the BSPS unit 202 calls the terminal which downloads<br><br>
25                                                                           13<br>
the source file (step 314). If the terminal responds (step<br>
316), the BSPS unit 202 transmits to the responded terminal<br>
the background sound source file selected by the user (step<br>
318). At this time, the BSPS unit 202 may retrieve the<br>
Spersonal portable terminal to see whether it has a<br>
background sound control program equipped therein, and<br>
transmit a background sound control program according to<br>
the user's selection (step 318). In this case, depending<br>
on the type of the personal portable terminal, a suitable<br>
10background sound control program is automatically selected<br>
and transmitted to the terminal from the BSPS unit.<br>
Thereafter, the BSPS unit sends a transmission completion<br>
message to the personal portable terminal (step 320). The<br>
transmission completion message may be displayed, on the<br>
15display unit of the personal portable terminal.<br>
On the other hand, at the step 310 described above,<br>
if the user does not request download of a background sound<br>
source file, the BSPS unit proceeds to the step 304. Of<br>
course, it is possible to design such that the above steps<br>
20306 and 308 can be omitted, and thus the step 310 can be<br>
carried out right after the step 304. At the step 316, if<br>
the personal portable terminal does not answer to the call<br>
of the step 314, the BSPS unit may send an error message to<br>
the personal portable terminal (step 322).<br>
25 As described above, the user can select and download<br>
background sound source files to his taste to his personal<br>
portable terminal after selecting and pre-listening to each<br>
of the various background sounds stored in the BSPS unit.<br>
Then, while communicating, the user can use the background<br>
30sound stored in his own portable terminal by using the<br>
background sound control program.<br>
The above-described background sound control program,<br>
is configured such that during communication it can<br>
identify a key input and execute a series of commands,<br><br>
14<br>
which are established corresponding to each dial key.<br>
Furthermore, the background sound control program enables<br>
the personal portable terminal to display the downloaded<br>
background sound source file on its own display unit, to<br>
5output and pre-listen to a selected one through the<br>
personal portable terminal, and to delete any selected<br>
background sound source file when required. In addition,<br>
the background sound control program allows for setting<br>
each background sound correspondingly to a number key of<br>
10the personal portable terminal so that the background sound<br>
can be conveniently used during communication, by simply<br>
pressing down the corresponding number key. Also, each<br>
command to be executed by the background sound control<br>
program is established by means of each individual or<br>
15combination of keys, so that, while communicating, the<br>
control program can identify a key input and carry out the<br>
command corresponding to the identified key input, for<br>
example, execution of background sound, intermission of the<br>
execution, change of background sound, or the like. The<br>
20background sound control program will be hereinafter<br>
explained in greater detail through en exemplary program.<br>
According to the present invention, the background<br>
sound control program is generally divided into two parts.<br>
The first part is designed such that, before starting to<br>
25communicate, each background sound stored in the personal<br>
portable terminal can be pre-set to correspond to one of<br>
the number key 1 to 9 of the portable terminal. The second<br>
part enables the personal portable terminal to identify a<br>
key input and execute a series of orders according to the<br>
30key input, for example, execution of background sound<br>
source files, intermission of the execution, adjustment of<br>
output volume, and the like.<br>
The background sound control program of the invention<br>
may be developed by using a development tool supplied from<br><br>
15<br>
terminal manufacturers or communication service providers,<br>
and the development tool provides for various functions,<br>
including a function for identifying a key input and a<br>
function for reproducing a media file such as a sound<br>
5source file. Therefore, these functions allow for<br>
identifying an input key from the personal portable<br>
terminal.<br>
In the background sound control program of this<br>
embodiment, each key of a personal portable terminal has a<br>
10pre-defined value. That is, the number key 0 to 9<br>
corresponds respectively to KEY_NUMO, KEY_NUM1, KEY_NUM2,<br>
KEY_NUM3, KEY_NUM4, KEY_NUM5, KEY_NUM6, KEY_NUM7, KEY_NUM8,<br>
and KEY_NUM9, and the star key arid pound key correspond to<br>
KEY_STAR, and KEY_POUND respectively. These pre-defined<br>
15values may be set differently depending on different<br>
terminal manufacturers or communication service companies.<br>
In addition, a function for reproducing an audio file such<br>
as a background sound source file may be embodied through<br>
built-in functions equipped in the personal portable<br>
20terminal.<br>
In the background sound control program of the<br>
invention, the first part for setting the background sound<br>
correspondingly to the number key 1 to 9 is composed of the<br>
steps of outputting the list of background sound source<br>
25files stored in the personal portable terminal on the<br>
display unit thereof, selecting one from the displayed<br>
list, reproducing the selected one in order to pre-listen,<br>
and setting the selected one to one of the number keys.<br>
The steps may be embodied in the following manner.<br>
30 bgmList = getBgmList(); // get the list of background<br>
sound source files stored in the terminal<br>
Display. display (bgmList); // display the List of<br>
background sound source files<br>
KeyPcessed(keyCode) // wait a key input signal<br><br>
16<br>
if (key = reproduction of sound) // if the key input<br>
requests for reproduction of background sound source files<br>
{ CurrentAudio = AudioSystem.getAudioClip{); //<br>
5prepare for reproduction of audio file<br>
CurrentAudio.Open (bgmListf [indexSelect]); // prepare<br>
for reproduction of selected background sound source file<br>
CurrentAudio.PIay(); // reproduce the selected<br>
background sound source file<br>
10 }<br>
else if (key = intermission of reproduction) // if<br>
the key input request for stopping the reproduction<br>
{ CurrentAudio.Stop(); // stop the reproduction of<br>
background sound source file<br>
15 }<br>
else if (key = delete background sound source<br>
file) // if the key input requests for deleting the<br>
selected background sound source file<br>
{ File xFile = File(bgmList[indexSelect]); // get<br>
20information on the selected background sound source file<br>
xFile.Delete(); // delete the selected background<br>
sound source file<br>
}<br>
else if (key = set a background sound source file) //<br>
25if the key input requests for setting the selected<br>
background sound souroe file to a key number<br>
( num = keyPressed (); // wait a key input of one of<br>
the number 1 to 9<br>
bgmSettirog(num, bgmList[indexSelect]); // set the<br>
30selected background sound source file to the key input<br>
}<br>
else if (key = delete the list of BSSF) //if the key<br>
input requests for deleting the list of background sound<br>
source files<br><br>
17<br>
{ bgmList.Delete(currentIndex); // delete the list of<br>
background sound source files<br>
}<br>
}<br>
5 Again, the background sound source files as set above<br>
may be controlled such that the above-set background sound<br>
source files can be reproduced in sequence or in a random<br>
order, or can be reproduced according to a particular key<br>
input by a user.<br>
10 In the background sound control program of the<br>
invention, the second part for carrying out, according to a<br>
key input during communication, reproduction of a<br>
background sound, intermission of reproduction and<br>
adjustment of volume is composed of the steps of activating<br>
15the background sound control program, identifying a key<br>
input, and executing reproduction of background sound<br>
source file, intermission of reproduction and volume<br>
adjustment. Further, the key input signal can be easily<br>
identified by means of a development tool supplied by<br>
20terminal manufacturers or communication service providers,<br>
In the background sound control program of the<br>
invention, for example, the second part described above,<br>
i.e., identification of a key input during communication<br>
and, according to the key input signal, reproduction of a<br>
25background sound source file, intermission of reproduction<br>
and volume adjustment or the like can be embodied in the<br>
following manner.<br>
bgmList = getBgmList(); // get information on the set<br>
background sound source files<br>
30 // prepare for reproduction according to the<br>
information<br>
CurrentAudio = AudioSystem.getAudioClip(bgmList);<br>
while (true)<br><br>
35                                                                                 18<br>
// wait for a key input<br>
key = keyPressed ();<br>
// if the key is a number 1 to 8<br>
if (key &gt;= KEY_NUM1 key 
5background sound source file<br>
{<br>
// stop if a background sound source file is being<br>
reproduced<br>
if (CurrentAudio.isPlay() == true) CurrentAudio.Stop<br>
10 ();<br>
// prepare for reproduction of the selected<br>
background sound source file<br>
CurrentAudio.Open (bgmList[key]);<br>
// reproduce the selected background sound source<br>
15file<br>
CurrentAudio.Play ();<br>
1<br>
// if the key is a number 0.<br>
else if (key == KEY_NUM0) // stop reproduction<br>
20 {<br>
// stop if a BSSF is being reproduced<br>
if (CurrentAudio.isPlay() == true) CurrentAudio.Stop<br>
();<br>
}<br>
25 // increase volume if the key is a pound Key<br>
else if (key = KEY_PQUND) // increase volume<br>
{<br>
// get the current volume<br>
CurrentAudioFormat = AudioSystem.getClipFormats();<br>
30           currentVolume = AudioSystera.getVolume();<br>
// increase volume<br>
currentvolume++;<br>
// set the increased volume<br>
AudioSystem.setVolume(currentAudioFormat,<br><br>
19<br>
currentVolme}<br>
}<br>
// decrease volusve if the key is a stat key *<br>
else if (key = KEY_STAR) // decrease volume<br>
5 {<br>
// get the current volume<br>
currentAudioFormt = Audio System.getClipFormats();<br>
currentVolume = AudioSystem.getVoluine();<br>
// decrease voLume<br>
10 currentVolume--;<br>
// set the decreased volume<br>
AudioSystem.setVolume(currentAudioFormat,<br>
currentvolume);<br>
}<br>
15 }<br>
As described above, the background sound control<br>
program is configured to identify a key input while<br>
communicating, to reproduce a background sound source file<br>
stored in the user portable terminal, to stop the<br>
20reproduction when required, or to adjust the volume of<br>
background sound being reproduced according to the key<br>
input.<br>
The above-described background sound control program<br>
is illustrated by way of an example for the purpose of<br>
25presenting an algorithm thereof. Therefore, it may be<br>
embodied in many ways, depending on the type of terminals<br>
and the terminal manufacturer, and the development tools<br>
supplied by the terminal manufacturer and the communication<br>
service company.<br>
30 FIG. 4 is a flow chart showing a procedure of setting<br>
a background sound to a personal terminal according to one<br>
embodiment of the invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, first, a central processing unit<br>
(CPU) such as a micro process unit (MPU) equipped in a<br><br>
20<br>
personal portable terminal determines whether a key input<br>
occurs in order to carry out a command (step 400). As the<br>
result of the determination, if a key input is received,<br>
the CPU determines whether the key input is an incoming<br>
5signal {step 402}. In other words, at the steps 400 and<br>
402, the personal portable terminal waits for a key input<br>
signal or an incoming signal and, if a Key input is for<br>
setting a background sound, carries out step 412, otherwise<br>
proceeds to the step 402. At the step 4 02, the CPU<br>
10determines if the key input is an incoming signal.<br>
Thereafter, if the key input is an incoming signal,<br>
the CPU determines whether the incoming signal is an<br>
incoming call from the BSPS unit, i.e., a call for a<br>
download service of background sound source files (step<br>
15404). If not a download call, the CPU carries out a normal<br>
incoming call operation (step 406).<br>
As the result of the determination at the step 404,<br>
if the incoming signal is a download call, the CPU<br>
downloads the background sound source file and stores it in<br>
20the personal portable terminal (steps 408, 410). That is,<br>
referring to FIG. 2, the personal portable terminal denoted<br>
at 208 responds to a download call from the BSPS unit 202<br>
and receives background sound source files and stores them<br>
in the memory unit of its own.<br>
25 on the other hand, at the above step 400, if the<br>
personal portable terminal at a standby state receives a<br>
key input signal corresponding to the setting of background<br>
sound, the CPU carries out steps 414 to 426 in response to<br>
the key input. Specifically, the CPU determines whether<br>
30the key input is to set a background sound or to change an<br>
already-set background sound (step 412). This key input<br>
signal Eor setting or changing a background sound may be<br>
embodied by an exclusive button provided by the terminal<br>
manufacturer or by a combination of keys or 3 menu<br><br>
21<br>
selection. If the key input is not to set or change a<br>
background sound, the step 414 is carried out as in the<br>
operations of normal key inputs (step 414).<br>
On the other hand, as the result of the determination<br>
5at the step 412, if the key input is to set or change a<br>
background sound, the CPU displays the list of background<br>
sound source files stored in its own memory and waits for<br>
user's selection (step 416). At this time, the user may<br>
select one from the list and pre-listen to the selected<br>
10background sound (step 418 and step 420). Thereafter, the<br>
user sets the selected background sound to a particular key<br>
(button) (step 422, 424 and 426).<br>
As described above in connection with PIG. 4, the<br>
user can pie-listen to each of the background sounds stored<br>
15in his own portable terminal, select his favorite sounds or<br>
agreeable sounds to his taste, and set and use them as a<br>
background sound during communicating with others through<br>
his portable terminal. The user can store background sound<br>
source files in his own portable terminal as many as<br>
20possible so long as the capacity of the memory unit allows<br>
for storing them. The background sound Source files<br>
already-stored in the user terminal can be deleted, when<br>
required, in the same way that general information stored<br>
in a personal portable terminal is deleted.<br>
25 As described above, when a user communicates with<br>
other receiving party along with a background sound, the<br>
receiving or calling party can send to the counterpart the<br>
stored background sounds in sequence or in a random order,<br>
together with voice signal by carrying out a key operation<br>
30pre-established to execute the corresponding commands.<br>
Therefore, an individuality or personality of the<br>
communication can be realized. A user can download<br>
background sound source files from the BSPS unit through a<br>
wire or wireless communication network, and store them in<br><br>
22<br>
his own portable terminal, so that a background sound can<br>
be reproduced by means of a simple key operation during<br>
communication, along with intermission of the reproduction,<br>
volume control and the like.<br>
5 FIG. 5 is a flow chart illustrating a communication<br>
procedure using a background sound service according to one<br>
embodiment of the invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, in order to communicate along<br>
with a background sound, first the calling party uses an<br>
10established menu or presses down a pre-defined key, and<br>
input the receiving party number to initiate a call (steps<br>
500, 502 and 504). When the receiving party responds and a<br>
communication channel is established (step 506), the<br>
calling party selects and reproduces one of the background<br>
15sounds stored in his portable terminal by operating a key<br>
corresponding to the background sound to be selected and<br>
the reproduction of it (step 508). In this way, the<br>
calling party can communicate with the receiving party<br>
while transmitting various background sounds (step 510).<br>
20 At this time, the calling party can execute<br>
reproduction of a background sound, intermission of the<br>
reproduction and volume adjustment by pressing down a<br>
corresponding dial-key during communication (step 512).<br>
That is, the calling party controls the volume of<br>
25background sound by means of a specific key input (step<br>
516). The personal portable terminal determines if the<br>
input key is to adjust the volume of background sound (step<br>
512 and step 514). On the other hand, the calling party<br>
can change the background sound being reproduced by<br>
30operating a specified key for changing the background sound<br>
(step 524). At this time, the personal portable terminal<br>
determines whether the key input is to switch the<br>
background sound (step 512 and step 522). Furthermore, the<br>
calling part can stop the background sound being reproduced<br><br>
45                                                                                             23<br>
(step 520). At this time, a decision as to whether the key<br>
input is to stop the reproduction of background sound is<br>
made (step 512 and step 518).<br>
As the result ot the determination at the above steps<br>
5512, 518, 522, if the key input is not to control or change<br>
the background sound being played, the reproduction of the<br>
background continues (step 526). If the calling party ends<br>
the communication or press down a specified key for ending<br>
the communication, the transmission of the background sound<br>
10ends at the same time. In other words, if the key input is<br>
not to control the background sound, a normal service is<br>
continued in the same way as in a normal mode of voice<br>
communication or data communication.<br>
On the other hand, when a receiving party responds to<br>
15a calling party, the calling party can provide a background<br>
sound service according to the present invention, by<br>
selecting a key specified corresponding to the background<br>
service mode. This operation is well-known to those<br>
skilled in the art, and thus details on the operation will<br>
20not be described. This is, in the present invention, a<br>
calling or receiving party, by mean of his own portable<br>
terminal, provides a background sound during communication.<br>
As describe above, according to the present<br>
invention, a user can pre-listen to a background sound from<br>
25a unit storing a plurality of background sound source files<br>
through a wire or wireless communication network, then<br>
select and download a favorite background sound source<br>
file, and store it in his own personal portable terminal.<br>
More specifically, the user terminal is connected through a<br>
30wire on wireless communication network to a service<br>
providing unit having a database with background sound<br>
source files stored therein. Then, the service providing<br>
unit transmits a list of background sound source files to<br>
the connected user terminal, and the user requests for<br><br>
24<br>
downloading of a selected background sound source file from<br>
the transmitted list. The requested background sound<br>
source file is transmitted to the user terminal from the<br>
service providing unit, which sends a transmission<br>
5completion message to the personal portable terminal upon<br>
completion of transmission and downloading.<br>
Next, according to the present invention, the<br>
downloaded background sound source file may be set up as a<br>
background sound of a personal portable terminal.<br>
10specifically, the list of the downloaded and stored<br>
background sound source files can be displayed on a display<br>
unit of the personal portable terminal. The user can pre-<br>
listen to each of the listed background sound and select a<br>
specific background sound and set the selected one to a<br>
15background sound, which is to be used during communication.<br>
Furthermore, according to the present invention, the<br>
background sound stored in the user portable terminal can<br>
be transmitted to a counterpart in real-time while<br>
communicating, along with voice signal. In other words, a<br>
20calling or receiving party can output a background sound<br>
stored in his own portable terminal to the counterpart when<br>
communicating. More specifically, each background sound<br>
stored in the user portable terminal can be pre-set to a<br>
specific dial key, for example, number 1 to 9, each<br>
25corresponding to a specific background sound. In addition,<br>
other specific dial-key, for example, number 0, star-key<br>
(*) or pound-key (#), can be pre-set to a command for<br>
reproducing a background sound source file and transmitting<br>
to the receiving party, for stopping the transmission, or<br>
30for adjusting the output volume of a background sound being<br>
transmitted. Therefore, while communicating, the<br>
background sound service can be controlled toy simply<br>
operating the key pre-set to each corresponding command.<br>
FIG. 6 is a block diagram illustrating the<br><br>
25<br>
construction of a personal portable terminal suitable for a<br>
background sound service during communication according to<br>
one embodiment of the invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, the personal portable terminal<br>
5comprises a central processing unit 600, a key input unit<br>
602, a IF connector 604, a display unit 608, a wireless<br>
transmitting and receiving unit 610, an amplifier 612, a<br>
CODEC 614, an audio decoder 616, a memory unit 618, a loud<br>
speaker 624 and 626, and a mike 628. Specifically, the<br>
10central processing unit 600 may include a micro processing<br>
unit (MPU) and control the general operation of the<br>
personal portable terminal. According to a signal input by<br>
the key input unit 602, the central processing unit 600 is<br>
operated such that the audio decoder 616 reproduces a<br>
15background sound source file stored in a background sound<br>
source file database 622 into an analog signal. In<br>
addition, the CODEC 614 synthesizes the analog signal with<br>
a voice signal from the mike 628. The synthesized signal<br>
is transmitted to a receiving party through the wireless<br>
20transmitting and receiving unit 610.<br>
The key input unit 602 is composed of plural number<br>
and function keys and, when a user presses down a<br>
particular key, sends to the central processing unit 600 a<br>
signal corresponding to the key input. In this invention,<br>
25the number and function keys are used during communication<br>
in order to carry out execution of reproduction of a<br>
background sound, change of background sound, automatic<br>
continuous execution, intermission of execution, control of<br>
output level, or the like. In this case, when the central<br>
30processing unit 600 receives a key input from the key input<br>
unit 601, it determines, by means of a background sound<br>
control program 650 stored in the memory unit 618, whether<br>
the key input ig a background sound control key. The<br>
background sound control program 620 is configured such<br><br>
26<br>
that a background sound can be output to a communication<br>
channel, and intermission of background sound output or<br>
adjustment of output level can be carried out, according to<br>
a key input signal during communication.<br>
5 The IF-Connector 604 enables the personal portable<br>
terminal to be connected to an external device such as a<br>
hand free equipment and a data link, and allows for<br>
software up-grade and wireless date communication<br>
therethrough. In this embodiment, for example, the personal<br>
10portable terminal can be connected through the IF-Connector<br>
604 to a personal computer 606 or a personal digital<br>
assistant (PDA), through which a background sound source<br>
file can be downloaded and stored in the personal portable<br>
terminal.<br>
15 The display unit 608, such as a LCD, displays various<br>
operational states of the personal portable terminal.<br>
Also, the display unit 608 displays various information or<br>
menus related to the background sound service of the<br>
invention, so that the user can operate his personal<br>
20partable terminal while watching the information or menu<br>
expressed on the display unit 606, i.e., setting a<br>
background sound, pre-listening, downloading, deletion of<br>
background sound source file, or the like.<br>
The wireless transmitting and receiving unit 610<br>
25transfers a signal received through an antenna to the<br>
amplifier 612 and transmits a voice signal and data<br>
transferred from the amplified 612 through the antenna.<br>
The CODEC 614 converts an analog voice signal from<br>
the mike 623 into a digital signal and sends it to the<br>
30amplifier 612. Also, the CODEC 614 converts a digital<br>
signal from the amplifier 612 into an analog signal and<br>
sends it to the loud speaker 624 and 626.<br>
The memory unit 618 basically stores an address book,<br>
a telephone directory, bell sounds and the like. Also, the<br><br>
27<br>
memory unit 618 includes a background sound database for<br>
storing a plurality of background sound source files, and<br>
stores a background sound control program including various<br>
command routines each corresponding to a key input during<br>
5communication. The background sound source files stored in<br>
the memory unit 618 can be up-dated by downloading from a<br>
contents provider through a wireless communication network.<br>
Also, The background sound source files stored in the<br>
memory unit 618 can be up-dated by downloading from other<br>
10media such the personal computer 606 or a PDA, which is<br>
connected to the terminal through the IF Connector 604.<br>
Furthermore, the background sound control program may be<br>
stored in a memory of the personal portable terminal, or in<br>
a separate memory element equipped in the personal portable<br>
15terminal, Therefore, by using the background sound control<br>
program equipped in the personal portable terminal, the<br>
user can use selectively a built-in background sound or a<br>
downloaded one from a service provider. Also, the personal<br>
portable terminal can be connected to the service provider<br>
20and conveniently update its built-in background sound<br>
control program.<br>
The audio decoder 616 converts the background sound<br>
source file, which is stored in the background sound<br>
database 622 of the memory unit 618, into an analogue<br>
25signal, and sends the analog background sound signal to the<br>
loud speaker 624 or the receiver 626 through the CODEC 614.<br>
At this time, the CODEC 614 synthesizes the voice signal<br>
from the mike 628 with the analog background sound signal,<br>
and transmits the synthesized signal through the wireless<br>
30transmitting and receiving unit 610. Furthermore, in the<br>
case where the user voice signal is not received, the audio<br>
decoder 616 continues to send the background sound to the<br>
receiving party until a stop key signal is input by the<br>
user.<br><br>
55                                                                                  28<br>
As described above, the personal portable terminal of<br>
che invention includes a background sound control program,<br>
which can be downloaded from a service provider, or stored<br>
in a memory unit of the personal portable terminal or a<br>
5separate built-in memory equipped in the terminal.<br>
Particularly, in the case where a background sound control<br>
program is equipped in the terminal by the manufacturer,<br>
the user does not need to download from the service<br>
provider, but the equipped program can be up-graded from<br>
10the service providen by connecting the personal portable<br>
terminal thereto.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
