size of 150um in an amount and optional ingredients like colors and<br>
perfumes one by one within the time gap of 10 minutes after each<br>
addition the mixture is stirred; and<br>
(f)	continuing the mixing the above ingredients for 10 to 20 minutes till the<br>
mass becomes homogeneous and discharging from the homogenizer for<br>
packing.<br>
Wherein the scouring powder composition comprising<br>
fly ash as an abrasive agent ranging   between 40 and 75%<br>
a surfactant ranging between between 3 and 6%,<br>
an alkali metal carbonate ranging between 10 and 20%<br>
an alkali metal bicarbonate ranging between 3 and 15%,<br>
an alkali halide between 1 and 10%,<br>
clay between 5 to 50%, and<br>
balance to 100wt %of perfumes and colors<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the paddle mixer is equipped with circulatory cooling system for maintaining uniform temperature of the reaction.<br>
In an another embodiment water is circulated through the circulatory system.<br>
In an another embodiment in step (b) the ingredients used are added sequentially	i) sodium<br>
chloride; ii)        commercially available processed clay; iii) fly ash; iv) colors; and v) perfumes.<br><br>
In an another embodiment the low foaming scouring powder composition, comprising:<br>
between 40 and 75 % fly ash as an abrasive agent,<br>
between 3 and 6 % an surfactant,<br>
between 10 and 20 % an alkali metal carbonate,<br>
between 3 and 15 % an alkali metal bicarbonate,<br>
between 1 and 10 % an alkali halide,<br>
between 5 to 50 % clay, and<br>
optionally traces of perfumes and colors.<br>
In an another embodiment the low foaming scouring powder composition, preferably<br>
comprising<br>
2 - 8% by wt surfactant,<br>
8-10% by wt sodium carbonate,<br>
5 - 7 wt % sodium Bicarbonate<br>
10-15 % by wt commercially available processed clay<br>
3-5 % by wt sodium chloride and<br>
balance to 100 wt % of fly ash accompanied by traces of perfumes and colors.<br>
In an another embodiment the surfactant used is selected from group consisting of<br>
anionic, nonionic and amphoteric surfactant.<br>
In an another embodiment the resultant scouring powder is low foaming.<br>
In an another embodiment any size fraction of fly ash could be used for the composition.<br>
In yet another embodiment the particle size of the fly ash is about 150jam.<br>
In yet   another embodiment the clay used is selected from group consisting of talc,<br>
processed clay, bentonite clay, mud clay, china clay and any other commercially<br>
available clay.<br>
In yet   another embodiment the composition is prepared in the form of solid, gel,<br>
solution, paste and powder.<br>
In yet another embodiment the composition is useful for cleaning concrete surfaces<br>
In a water-jacketed paddle mixer, acid slurry, sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate are mixed. Acid slurry reacts with sodium carbonate and bicarbonate to produce sodium salt of benzene sulphonic acid. Water is passed through jacket in controlled manner so to maintain the temperature of the mass around 50 to 60 degree Celsius. The mass is stirred for about 15 minutes and then discharged. The mass is then allowed to cool to room temperature and then transferred to a homogeniser such as edge running mixer. The remaining ingredients are then added one by one with 10 minutes' gap after each addition, with continuous mixing in the following sequence: i) sodium chloride; ii) commercially available processed clay; iii) fly ash ; iv) colour and v) perfume. Mixing is then continued till the mass becomes homogeneous.. This usually takes another 15 to 20 minutes.<br>
Scouring powder so produced is discharged from the homogeniser and stored for packing<br>
and distribution.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, preferred ranges of ingredients for the<br>
composition can be: Surfactant- 2 to 8 wt %; Sodium Carbonate- 8 to 10 wt %; Sodium<br>
Bicarbonate-5 to 7 wt % ; Commercially available processed clay-10 to 15 % ; Sodium<br>
Chloride- 3 to 5 wt % and balance to 100 wt % of fly ash accompanied by traces of<br>
perfumes &amp; colours.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the surfactant component comprises of<br>
at least one anionic, nonionic or amphoteric surfactant.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the scouring powder is low foaming.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, any size fraction of fly ash can be<br>
used.<br>
The novelty of the present invention resides in providing a scouring powder composition, utilizing fly ash as an abrasive agent, major component of the composition, which is otherwise a waste product and hardly 3% of total fly ash produced in the world could only be utilized till to date. Thereby the pollution due to fly ash could be minimized. The resultant composition is useful as a cleaning agent both in domestic sector as well as industrial sector.<br>
The above said novelty and usefulness has been achieved by the non-obvious scouring powder composition and inventive steps of the process of the present invention. The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention and should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.This composition contains the three essential ingredient viz. anionic surfactant, sodium carbonate and fly ash. Processed china clay was added to improve the abrasive action of fly ash and to lighten the colour of the composition. Processed clay also lightened the colour of the product. Scouring efficiency was tested on stained and scorched surfaces and found to be excellent.<br>
Example-2<br>
This composition was same as that of composition 1 except for addition of traces of detergent grade blue colour. This gave the product a nice bluish gray colour, which succeeded in masking the light gray colour of composition 1. Scouring efficiency was excellent.<br>
Percentages of anionic surfactant and sodium carbonate further reduced to 3 and 10% respectively. As proportion of fly ash was same as composition 3, abrasive efficiency remained same. However, dispersion was a bit reduced due to decrease in percentage of surfactant in the composition. Further, percentage of processed clay was increased to 17%. No substantial advantage of this increase was observed.<br>
In this case, a mixture of talc, bentonite and processed clay replaced 17% of processed clay in composition 4. Talc was added to act as lubricant during the cleaning process. Bentonite has higher water absorption capacity than processed clay and this property was explored by partial replacement of processed clay with bentonite. Due to this, marginal advantage over processed clay vis-a-vis synergistic action, was observed. However, colour of the product acquired a brownish tinge due to addition of bentonite. Sodium chloride was added to retain traces of moisture so as to reduce dustiness of the product, which was found to decrease in practical terms.In this case, talc and bentonite were added with total exclusion of processed clay. This was done to increase the marginal advantage obtained in composition 5. No further advantage vis-a-vis synergistic action was observed when compared to composition 5. But due to increased bentonite content, colour of the product is rendered dirty brown, which reduces consumer appeal. No additional advantage was observed due to addition of talc. It was therefore decided to revert back to processed clay for further compositions. Sodium bicarbonate was added (5%) and percentage of sodium carbonate was reduced to 10%. The purpose of addition of sodium bicarbonate was with the idea that during mixing, due to reaction with acidic surfactant, greater amount of carbon dioxide could be released, leading to a lighter product. This was actually found to be so. Scouring effect was excellent.<br>
Example-7<br>
As decided at the end of the experiment 6, talc and bentonite were rejected and processed clay was brought back into the composition. Scouring efficiency was found to be excellent.<br>
Traces of detergent grade color were added to composition 7. Small quantities of the above composition were randomly distributed to ten actual users for trial. Feed back received was good and this composition was taken as optimized composition. Table 9: Compositions examples 1 to 8.<br>
The main advantages of the present invention are:<br>
1.	Use of fly ash as an abrasive agent reduces the cost of production of scouring powder<br>
in comparison to the scouring powders already available in the market.<br>
2.	As per international standard the size of mineral abrasion agent in scouring powder<br>
