				<td>A PROCESS FOR ISOLATION OF ACTEOSIDE FROM PLANT COLERBROOKEA OPPOSITIFOLIA<br>
Field of the present invention<br>
A process for isolation of Acteoside from plant Colerbrookea oppositifolia, said process comprising steps of drying aerial parts of the plant, grounding the dried parts into powder, percolating the powder with water or ethanol for 3-4 times to obtain an extract, filtering the extract for clearing of suspended particles to obtain supernatant, drying the supernatant at about 45 to 55°C to obtain a residue, fractionating the residue with chloroform, ethyl acetate, and butanol successively, subjecting butanol fraction to adsorption chromatography of SiCh after adding methanol to the fraction, charging the adsorbed fraction to glass column, eluting the column with solvents of increasing polarity of methanol : chloroform to obtain further fractions and repeating the process one more time, subjecting the fractions to column chromatography to obtain fractions, concentrating the fractions under reduced pressure to obtain acteoside as residue; and a method of effectively hepatoprotecting a subject using pure Acteoside from plant Colerbrookea oppositifolia, said method comprising steps of administering appropriate low-dose of the acteoside to the subject. Background of the present invention<br>
Phenylethanoids are a class of compounds reported to be present in plants like Cistanche deserticola and Buddleja species ( Quanbo Xing, Koji Hase et al, Planta Median, 64. 120-125 (1998); Peter J. Houghton and Hiroshi Hikino. Planta Medial. Vol .55, 123-126(1989).<br>
It is for the first time that a phenylethanoid - verbascoside (also called acteoside or kusaginin) has been isolated by the authors from Colebrookea oppositifolia and found to possess a very strong antihepatotoxic/ hepatoprotective activity at unusually very low doses (between 1.25 and 2.5 mg /kg) in rats and mice.<br>
The presence of number of flavonoids and glycoflavonoids has already been reported in the literature from Colebrookea oppositifolia [S. Aziz Ahmed, S.A. Siddiqui and Asil" Zaman, Indian J. Chemistry 12 1327-28 (1974); S.A. Patwardhan and A.S.Gupta. Indian J. Chemistry. 20B, 627, (1981); Fan Yank, Xing-Li, HAN-Qing Wang and Chong-Ren Yang, Phytochemistry 42 , 867-69 (1996)]. However, the presence of Acteoside from this plant is being reported for the first time.<br><br>
Antifertiiity activity of this plant in male rats with special reference to testicular cell<br>
population dynamics have earlier been reported (R.S. Gupta, R.J. Yadav, V.P. Dixit<br>
and M.P. Dobhal, Fitoterapia, 72, 236-45 (2001).<br>
Though the Hepatoprotective/Antihepatotoxic activity of Acteoside (Verbascoside)<br>
isolated from other two plants viz. Cistanche species and Buddleja species has been<br>
reported. ( Quanbo Xing, Koji Hase et al, Planta Medica, 64, 120-125 (1998); Peter<br>
J. Houghton and Hiroshi Hikino. Planta Medica, Vol .55, 123-126 (1989), however<br>
the present invention not only reports a distinct source namely Colebrookea<br>
oppositifolia but the desired activity is accomplished at unusually very low dosage<br>
between 1.5 to 2.5 mg/kg in rats.<br>
As already stated above the Hepatoprotective/Antihepatotoxic activity of acteoside<br>
has been reported both in vitro and in vivo (Quanbo Xing, Koji Hase et al, Planta<br>
Medica, 64, 120-125 (1998). But the present invention describes the isolation of<br>
acteoside from a hitherto unreported source in such a way that the compound shows<br>
antihepatotoxic/hepatoprotective activity at doses nearly 12 to 25 times lower than<br>
those already reported in the prior art (Quanbo Xing, Koji Hase et al, Planta<br>
Medica, 64, 120-125(1998); Peter J. Houghton and Hiroshi Hikino. Planta Medica,<br>
Vol .55, 123-126 (1989). Moreover the parameters evaluated in the prior reports are<br>
limited to ALT (in vivo) and AST &amp; MDA (in vitro) whereas the present invention<br>
describes the influence of acteoside practically in all important parameters leading to<br>
for a clear decision on the efficacy of any hepatoprotective or antihepatotoxic<br>
product.<br>
The reason for the activity of acteoside at such low doses compared to the one<br>
reported in the prior art may be due to the specific method of its isolation being<br>
distinct to yield a product of higher purity. Contaminants in phytochemicals are well<br>
documented to seriously jeopardize the activity of pure active compound though<br>
there could be synergistic action also of which, however, there in no mention or<br>
indication in the prior art.<br>
Objects of the present invention<br>
The main object of the present invention is to isolate a hepatoprotective from plant<br>
Colerbrookea oppositifolia.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to develop a process for the isolation of<br>
acteoside from plant Colerbrookea oppositifolia.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to develop a method of hepatoprotecting<br>
a subject using Colerbrookea oppositifolia.<br>
Summary of the present invention<br>
A process of isolation of pure Acteoside of high hepatoprotection from plant<br>
Colerbrookea oppositifolia , said process comprising steps of drying aerial parts of<br>
the plant, grounding the dried parts into powder, percolating the powder with water or<br>
ethanol for 3-4 times to obtain an extract, filtering the extract for clearing of<br>
suspended particles to obtain supernatant, drying the supernatant at about 45 to 55°C<br>
to obtain a residue, fractionating the residue with chloroform, ethyl acetate, and<br>
butanol successively, subjecting butanol fraction to adsorption chromatography of<br>
SiC&gt;2 after adding methanol to the fraction, charging the adsorbed fraction to glass<br>
column, eluting the column with solvents of increasing polarity of methanol :<br>
chloroform to obtain further fractions and repeating the process one more time,<br>
subjecting the fractions to column chromatography to obtain fractions, concentrating<br>
the fractions under reduced pressure to obtain acteoside as residue; and a method of<br>
effectively hepatoprotecting a subject using pure Acteoside from plant Colerbrookea<br>
oppositifolia, said method comprising steps of administering appropriate low-dose of<br>
the acteoside to the subject.<br>

Acteoside or Kusaginin isolated and reported for the first time from a plant named<br>
Colerbrookea oppositifolia. The invention describes the isolation of verbascoside in a<br>
specific manner and demonstrates antihepatotoxic / hepatoprotective activity at very low<br>
doses against different toxins.<br>
The active compound acteoside (verbascoside) is being reported for the first time by<br>
the authors of invention from the plant Colebrookea oppositifolia. The authenticity of<br>
the acteoside isolated by the authors has been confirmed by *H and 13C NMR data<br>
similar to reported in literature (Phytochemistry 21, 1123-1127 (1982).<br>
Brief description of the accompanying drawings<br>
Fig 1 shows HPLC graph confirming purity.<br>
Fig 2 shows comparative hepatoprotective activity (%) of acteoside, silymarin, and<br>
glycyrrhizia.<br>
The process of isolation of acteoside from different extracts ( 95% ale., 50% ale. and<br>
aqueous) of the plant is described in the examples appended herewith as Annexure-1.<br>
The HPLC graph confirming purity is enclosed as fig-1.<br>
The compound has been bioevaluated for hepatoprotective/antihepatotoxic activity by<br>
using a comprehensive study design annexed herewith as Annexure-2. The<br>
parameters studied during the bioevaluation to establish the bioefficacy and optimum<br>
dose were preferred using the kits ( Clonital, Italy and Accurex Biomedical Pvt. Ltd<br>
Thane). The list of the parameters is given in Annexure-2 appended herewith. The<br>
dose response graphs with respect to different parameters in comparison with the<br>
standard drug with silymarin and glycyrrhizin are given in Annexure-3 appended<br>
herewith.<br>
The bioevaluation data for each dose of the acteoside as compared to reference<br>
materials viz. silymarin, glycyrrhizin, and required controls are given in the Table-1<br>
which is appended herewith the invention. As is clear from the figure 2 and Table-1<br>
all the parameters which were compromised after the administration of hepatotoxin<br>
CCU have a very good tendency to revert back to normal levels from a dose of 1.25<br>
mg upto 5 mg/kg of acteoside. The overall percent protection provided by acteoside<br>
with reference to all the parameters studied in the invention is generally from 40-80%,<br>
and is better than that rendered by silymarin even at 10-20 times the dosage of<br>
acteoside.<br>
The optimum dose to achieve this protection with acteoside of the invention lies<br>
between 1.25 mg/kg and 2.5 mg/kg. Statistically, there is no significance observed<br>
between the three doses viz. 1.25, 2.5 and 5 mg/kg except when 1.25 mg/kg dose data<br>
is compared with that of 5mg/kg dose (Table-2). But no statistical significance is<br>
observable between higher doses i.e. 2.5mg/kg and 5 mg/kg. At the same time, similar<br>
observation holds fully well for dose effect between 1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg.<br>
The above-stated invention is elaborated in the form of examples and should not be<br>
construed to limit the scope of the invention<br>
Example 1:<br>
Dried aerial parts of plant material Colebrookea oppositifolia (500 gm) were ground<br>
to a coarse powder. The powder was percolated with 95% ethanol for fourteen hours.<br>
Extraction process was repeated four times using total of 9 litres of 95% ethanol (3.0<br>
+2.0 + 2.0 + 2.0 Litre, four extractions) . All the four extracts were pooled and<br>
filtered clear of suspended particles. The supernatant was evaporated to dryness on a<br>
wiped film evaporator at 50±5°C. Residue obtained was 60 . 0 g , (coded as<br>
RJM/0862/P08/A001) extractive value 12%.<br>
The extract was fractionated with CHCh , EtOAc and «-BuOH (2 xl Litre each)<br>
successively. 15.0 g w-BuOH extract was subjected to adsorption chromatography<br>
after dissolving in minimum quantity of MeOH, and adsorbing on SiO2 gel, 100-200<br>
mesh (100 gm.) Solvent was completely removed to get free flowing material. The<br>
adsorbed extract was charged in a glass column of 37.5 mm 0. The column was<br>
eluted with solvents by gradually increasing the %age of MeOH in CHCb 105<br>
fractions of 100 ml each were collected and pooled on the bases of TLC patterns<br>
checked by using EtOAc: HCOOH : I-bO : : 8:1:1 as mobile phase. Spots were<br>
visualised by spraying with freshly prepared Borinate-PEG 4000 solution [1%<br>
solution of 2-aminoethyldiphenylborinate in MeOH and 5% solution of polyethylene<br>
glycol 4000 in EtOH (mixed 1:1 v/v before spraying)].<br>
Seven of the fractions showing same TLC pattern were pooled, dried and subjected to<br>
rechromatography using 100-200 mesh SiO2 gel column (1:20 ratio) and eluted with<br>
CHCb : MeOH mixtures of increasing polarity. In all 60 fractions of 200 ml each<br>
were collected. Eight of the fractions were pooled on the bases of TLC were dried and<br>
again subjected to column chromatography. 30 fractions of 100 ml each were<br>
collected. Six fractions were concentrated under reduced pressure. Residue was<br>
crystallised from MeOH / CHC^ as a colourless amorphous powder, soluble in<br>
MeOH . Compound found at Rf 0.42 , (solvent system EtOAc: HCOOH : H2O: :<br>
8:1:1) was coded as 862-11. The purity of 862-11 was established on the basis of<br>
HPLC using following operating conditions.<br>
Column : RP-18e (E-Merck, SUJTI, 4.6 x 250 mm), at<br>
Mobile Phase : Acetonitrile (B): 1.5% acetic acid in water (A)<br>
Flow rate : Iml/min.<br>
A,max : 335 nm<br>
The compound was established as Verbascoside on the basis of NMR ('H and I3C)<br>
and FABMS data.<br>
Example 2<br>
Dried aerial parts ( 500 gm) of Colebrookea oppositifolia were ground and<br>
percolated with 50% aqueous ethanol four times (50% EtOH, 4 x 2.5 Litre) for 14<br>
hrs each. All the four extracts were pooled. The pooled aqueous extracts were<br>
centrifuged, clear supernatant was evaporated to dryness on a wiped film evaporator<br>
at 50 ± 5°C. The residue (90 g) was coded as RJM/0862/P08/A002 (extractive value<br>
18%) and fractionated with CHCh, EtOAc and «-BuOH successively.<br>
The «-BuOH ext. was chromatographed on a column of silica gel (60-120 mesh)<br>
eluted with a gradient of MeOH in CHC13. The CHC13 : MeOH (5:1) eluate was<br>
rechromatographed on a silica gel (100-200 mesh) column using CHCh-MeOH :<br>
F^O (6:1:0.1) as solvent. Fractions homogeneous on TLC were pooled, dried and<br>
charged on a sephadex LH-20 column, eluted with MeOH to produce two fractions of<br>
500 ml each. Second fraction containing mainly the target compound (862-11) was<br>
subjected to further purification over a sephadex LH-20. Column was eluted with<br>
MeOH: H2O (3:2) to afford a fraction, which on crystallisation from MeOH/CHCl3<br>
yielded a colourless amorphous powder soluble in MeOH , Rf 0.42 (solvent system<br>
EtOAc:HCOOH : H2O:: 8:1:1).<br>
Standardisation of the extract RJM/0862/P08/A002 was carried out on the basis of<br>
862-11 by HPLC using following operating conditions:<br>
Column : RP-18e (E-Merck, Sum, 4.6 x 250 mm), at<br>
Mobile Phase : Acetonitrile (B): 1.5% acetic acid in water (A)<br>
Flow rate : Iml/min.<br>
Xmax : 335 nm<br>
The compound was established as Verbascoside on the basis of NMR (!H and I3C)<br>
and FABMS data.<br>
The %age of 862-11 in the extract RJM/0862/P08/A002 was found to be 0.86.<br>
Example 3<br>
Colebrookea oppositifolia aerial parts (500 g) were ground to a coarse powder and<br>
then extracted with deionised water at 98± 1°C for 2 hrs. Extraction process was<br>
repeated four times using total water (1 + 3 x 0.7 Litre, four extractions). All the four<br>
extracts were pooled The pooled extract was centrifuged, the clear filtrate was<br>
lyophilized to get light yellow amorphous powder (yield 95 gm). Aqueous extract<br>
residue and coded as RJM/0862/P08/A003 (extractive value 19%) was fractionated<br>
with CHClj, EtOAc and n-BuOH successively.<br>
M-BuOH extract was subjected to adsorption chromatography on SiCh gel, 60-120<br>
mesh (150 gm) . Solvent was completely removed to get free flowing material. A<br>
glass column of 1.5 inch dia was packed with 100 gm SiC&gt;2 gel, 60-120 mesh in<br>
EtOAc. The adsorbed material was charged in the column. The column was eluted<br>
with EtOAc and by gradually increasing the %age with MeOH . In all 120 fractions<br>
of 100 ml each were collected and pooled on the basis of TLC pattern ( EtOAc:<br>
HCOOH : H2O : : 8:1:1 as developing solvent). Spots were visualised by spraying<br>
with freshly prepared Borinate-PEG 4000 solution [1% solution of 2-<br>
aminoethyldiphenylborinate in MeOH and 5% solution of polyethylene glycol 4000 in<br>
EtOH (mixed 1:1 v/v before spraying)].<br>
Fractions eluted in EtOAc and 10% MeOH showed same TLC pattern. These<br>
fractions were pooled, dried and then dissolved in minimum quantity of MeOH .<br>
Crystallisation was carried out by the addition of CHCls in small portions to methanol<br>
solution which yielded a colourless amorphous powder characterised as 862-11 .<br>
Standardisation of the extract RJM/0862/P08/A003 was carried out on the basis of<br>
862-11 by HPLC using following operating conditions :<br>
Column : RP-18e (E-Merck, 5um, 4.6 x 250 mm), at<br>
Mobile Phase : Acetonitrile (B): 1.5% acetic acid in water (A)<br>
Flow rate : Iml/min.<br>
A-max : 335 nm<br>
The compound was established as Verbascoside on the basis of NMR ('H and 13C)<br>
and FABMS data.<br>
The %age of 862-11 in the extract RJM/0862/P08/A003 was found to be 0.22.<br>

(ALT, &amp; AST): Pyruvate formed by transamination<br>
reaction was determined spectrophotometrically after<br>
reaction with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (Reitman and<br>
Frankel, 1957).<br>
/»-nitrophenol formed in alkaline medium was<br>
measured spectrophotometrically using p-nitrophenyl<br>
phosphate as substrate (Waler and Schutt, 1974).<br>
It was determined after deproteination by reaction with<br>
DTNB (Ellman 1959 as modified by David 1987).<br>
Lipid peroxidation :Thiobarbituric acid reacting substances were<br>
determined spectrophotometrically at 535 nm. By the<br>
method of Buege and Aust (1978).<br>
Hepatoprotective activity :<br>
Hepatoprotective activity (H) was calculated by the following equation :<br>
H = [1-(TC- V/VC-V)]xlOO<br>
Where TC, VC, and V are drug + toxin, vehicle + toxin and vehicle treated groups<br>
of animals respectively.<br><br><br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1.	A process for isolation of Acteoside from plant Colerbrookea oppositifolia<br>
. characterized in that the said processs comprising steps of:<br>
a.	drying aerial parts of the plant,<br>
b.	grounding the dried parts into powder,<br>
c.	percolating the powder with water or ethanol for 3-4 times to obtain an<br>
extract,<br>
d.	filtering the extract for clearing  of suspended particles  to  obtain<br>
supernatant,<br>
e.	drying the supernatant at about 45 to 55 C to obtain a residue,<br>
f.	fractionating the residue with chloroform, ethyl acetate, and butanol<br>
successively,<br>
g.	subjecting butanol fraction to adsorption chromatography of SiO2 after<br>
adding methanol to the fraction,<br>
h.   charging the adsorbed fraction to glass column,<br>
i.    eluting the column with solvents of increasing polarity of methanol :<br>
chloroform to obtain further fractions and repeating the process one<br>
more time, j.    subjecting the fractions to column chromatography to obtain fractions, k.   concentrating the fractions under reduced pressure to obtain acteoside as<br>
residue.<br>
2.	A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the extracts are aqueous and alcoholic extracts.<br>
3.	A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein acteoside is about 1.0% (\vt.) of the total extract.<br></td>
