"A PROCESS FOR MANUFACTURING AN UNSATURATED<br>
MONONITRILES"<br>
THE STANDARD OIL COMPANY, of 4101Winfield Road, Warrenville,<br>
IL 60555, U.S.A.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The field of this invention relates to continuous processes for recovery and purification of organic values from hot gaseous mixtures which are obtained by catalytic ammoxidation of a light hydrocarbon compounds. More particularly, this invention relates to recovery and refining of valuable nitrogen-containing organic compounds formed by catalytic oxidation of least one feed compound selected from the group consisting of propane, propylene, isobutane and isobutylene in the presence of ammonia to produce a gaseous reactor effluent containing the corresponding unsaturated mononitrile. Processes of the invention include quenching the gaseous reactor effluent with an aqueous quench liquid; forming an aqueous solution comprising the corresponding unsaturated mononitrile, hydrogen cyanide and other organic co-products; and using an integrated sequence of distillations and phase separations to recover for recycle of a useful aqueous liquid, and obtain valuable nitrogen-containing organic compounds and hydrogen cyanide products. Beneficially, according to the invention aqueous solutions are fractionated in an integrated system of multi-stage columns while an effective polymerization inhibiting amount of at least one member of a preselected class of p-phenylenediamine compounds is maintained therein.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
As is well known, most of the commercial acrylonitrile is produced with the Sohio Process from propylene by heterogeneous catalytic ammoxidation of propylene in the vapor phase with ammonia, air and steam. For exmple see U.S. Patent Numbers 3,222,422 in the name of L. A. Cohen; 3,278,642 and 3,346,520 both in the name of L. Lee; 3,442,981 in the name of 0.<br>
2<br><br>
L. Stafford, D. V. Wing and D. E. Stolsmark;   and 3,509,238 in the name of N. E. Aubery and M. B. Jastrzebeski.<br>
In a commercial acrylonitrile system utilizing this process, the reactor feeds are propylene, ammonia and compressed air. The propylene and ammonia are vaporized, then combined with the air and fed to a fluidized bed catalytic reactor. Precise ratios of the three feeds are maintained for optimum yield. The catalyst in the reactor vessel is in the form of particles, which are maintained in a turbulent fluid state by the velocity of gaseous flow through the bed.<br>
Propylene, ammonia and oxygen mix together in the reactor and oxidation of propylene in the presence of ammonia takes place on the surface of the fluidized catalyst. A set of complex exothermic reactions takes place, thereby forming the following products: acrylonitrile, hydrogen cyanide, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, acetonitrile, acrolein, acrylic acid, water, other higher nitrites, aldehydes, ketones, acetic acid and a number of miscellaneous unknown organic compounds. Conversion of the three feeds is less than 100 percent, thus unreacted propylene, ammonia, oxygen and nitrogen are contained in the reactor effluent gas. The source of propylene typically contains a small amount of propane and some heavier hydrocarbon compounds which most of which are purged from the process unreacted. A portion of the heat of the exothermic reaction is removed by sets of steam coils which generate and superheat waste steam at approximately 600 psig for process uses such as heat input for 9distillations in the products recovery and purification section of the process. Reactor effluent gas passes through cyclones, which remove catalyst fines from the gas. The gas is then further cooled in a reactor effluent cooler, which is comprised of a shell and tube exchanger using boiler feed-water as the cooling source.<br>
As the gas leaves the reactor effluent cooler, it then enters a quench column. The quench column cools the reactor effluent by contacting it with a recirculating water stream. Most of the water vapor and small amounts of organic vapors  in the i reactor<br>
3 <br>
effluent are condensed in the quench column. The quench column bottoms are cooled and circulated back to the quench column. The quench column can contain internal trays 6r packing to provide intimate contact of upflowing gas with downflowing water. Sulfuric acid is injected into the recirculating quench water to neutralize unreacted ammonia in the reactor effluent. The excess quench water is roughly equal to the amount of water produced by the reactor and is fed to the wastewater column where acrylonitrile and hydrogen cyanide are recovered. Wastewater column bottoms are cooled and neutralized, mixed with other plant waste streams, clarified and injected into the wastewater injection well. The quench column effluent gas is then directed to an absorber where chilled water is used to obtain an aqueous solution of acrylonitrile, hydrogen cyanide and other organics from the gas.<br>
The aqueous solution from the absorber is fed to a recovery column where acrylonitrile and hydrogen cyanide are taken overhead. A portion of the bottoms from the recovery column is cooled and recycled to the absorption step. This recycle contains both inorganic and organic compounds in the form of monomers, oligomers, prepolymers, and polymers in various combinations. Acrylonitrile, hydrogen cyanide and optionally acetonitrile products are then purified using a series of distillations and phase separations. A first column (heads column) removes hydrogen cyanide, and at last column (acrylonitrile product column) takes a pure acrylonitrile monomer product from a side-draw near the top of the column. High-boiling organic compounds are rejected from the product column bottoms.<br>
Acrylonitrile can polymerize in the quench column. More specifically, as the reactor effluent gas is passed through the quench column, a portion of the acrylonitrile contained in the gas polymerizes and is absorbed into the recirculating quench water. The amount of acrylonitrile that polymerizes in the quench column represents an undesirable net product loss for the acrylonitrile plant. For example, in an uninhibited quench column, between  about 2 to 5 percent of the  total  acrylonitrile<br>
4<br><br>
produced  by the  reactor  is lost due  to polymerization  in the quench column.<br>
Several methods are known to reduce losses of acrylonitrile by polymerization and other side reactions, which involve treating the recirculating quench water. For example see U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,691,226; 4,720,566; 5,869,730; 5,895,822 and 6,238,574, which patents are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
U.S. Patent Number 4,720,566, in the name of John F, Martin, describes methods and compositions for inhibiting acrylonitrile polymerization in quench columns of systems producing acrylonitrile with a combination of (a) a hydroxylamine having two alkyl groups, and (b) a para-phenylenediamine with a substituent phenyl group or unsubstituted para-phenylenediamine.<br>
Unfortunately, under operating conditions, acrylonitrile can also polymerize in the recovery and purification sections to from solid deposits which interfere with operation of equipment, contribute to an undesirable net production loss and reduction in production rates, and with time lead to costly shutdowns.<br>
Such polymers, oligomers, and prepolymers, in various combinations, foul heat exchange surfaces of the heat exchangers used to maintain operating conditions for separation in the distillation columns and other process equipment. Fouled heat exchange surfaces reduce the coefficient of heat transfer thereby increasing the amount of heat transfer medium which must be used to realize the required amount of heating and/or Cooling obtained on clean surfaces. Eventually, the heat exchanger must be manually cleaned with potential exposure of personnel to hazardous chemicals.<br>
It is therefore a general object of the present invention to provide an improved process which overcomes the aforesaid problem of prior art methods for to recovery and refining of valuable nitrogen-containing organic compounds formed by catalytic oxidation of least one feed compound selected from the<br>
5<br><br>
group    consisting    of   propane,    propylene,     isobutane    and isobutylene in the presence of ammonia.<br>
Improved processes would utilize a preselected class of polymerization inhibiting compositions effective under operating conditions during fractional distillations of aqueous solutions comprising the unsaturated mononitrile products.<br>
Advantageously, members of such a class of inhibiting compositions would be effectively separated by the fractional distillation of the purified products.<br>
Other objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent upon reading the following detailed description and appended claims.<br>

STATEMENT OF INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a process for manufacturing an unsaturated mononitrile which process comprises: reacting at least one feed compound selected from the group consisting of propane, propylene, isobutane and isobutylene, with ammonia and a source comprising dioxygen in the presence of a catalyst in a reactor to produce a reactor effluent containing the; corresponding unsaturated mononitrile; transferring the reactor effluent containing the unsaturated mononitrile to a quench/absorption section wherein the reactor effluent containing the unsaturated mononitrile is contacted with at least a first aqueous stream to cool the reactor effluent, and thereafter the cool effluent is contacted with at least a second aqueous stream in an absorption column to separate and recover the unsaturated mononitrile in an aqueous solution; transferring the aqueous solution containing the unsaturated mononitrile to a recovery and purification section where the unsaturated mononitrile is recovered and purified in at least a first distillation column and a second distillation column; and maintaining within one or more of the distillation columns an effective polymerization inhibiting amount of at least one phenylenediamine compound represented by the formula:<br><br><br><br>
Wherein, Ph is a phenylene group, and R.sub.l and R.sub.2 are the same or different and are hydroxyl free organic moieties having about 2 to about 10 carbon atoms with the proviso that neither R.sub.l nor R.sub.2 is a phenyl group.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Processes of this invention are particularly suitable for use in recovery and refilling of an unsaturated aliphatic nitrile product, such as acrylonitirle or methacrylonitirle, from a gaseous mixture produced, generally by gas-phase catalytic oxidation <br><br>
13<br><br>
and/or thermal oxidation of olefin and ammonia with a source of dioxygen, typically comprising compressed air. The well known and most widely used commercial processes for production of acrylonitrile by ammoxidation of propylene with ammonia is the Sohio Process.<br>
As is well known, performance of the oxidation catalysts is an important factor, perhaps the most significant factor, in the economics of this and other oxidation processes. Catalyst performance is measured by activity, i.e., conversion of reactants, selectivity, i.e. conversion of reactant to desired product, rate of production of desired product per unit of reactor volume per unit of time, and catalyst life, i.e. effective time on-stream before significant loss of activity or selectivity.<br>
The practice of the process of the present invention is not dependent upon any specific ammoxidation fluid bed catalyst. Suitable catalysts which are more selective for the ammoxidation of propylene and isobutylene can be prepared from bismuth, cobalt, iron, nickel, tin salts, and molybdic, molybdic phosphoric, and molybdic silicic acids. Other components, such as tungsten, copper, tellurium, and arsenic oxides, have been incorporated to increase low temperature activity and productivity.<br>
Factors upon which catalyst performance depends include composition, the methods of preparation, support, and calcination conditions. Other key properties include, In addition to chemical performance requirements, other key properties include surface area, porosity, density, pore size distribution, hardness, strength, and resistance to mechanical attrition.<br>
Patents claiming specific catalysts and processes for their use in the manufacture of acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile by the ammoxidation of propylene and isobutylene, respectively, include U.S. Patent Numbers 2,481,826; 2,904,580; 3,044,966; 3,050,546; 3,197,419; 3,198,750; 3,200,084; 3,230,246, 3,248,340 and 3,352,764 which patents are incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
14<br><br><br>
Feeds for the ammoxidation combine to contain a mixture of propylene, air, ammonia, and optionally an supplementary source of dioxygen. Beneficially, feed compositions range up to about 9 percent propylene on molar basis. Gaseous mixtures in the ammoxidation reactors are kept too low in oxygen to be flammable during normal operation. Reactor start-up and shutdown procedures are likewise designed to avoid flammable feed mixtures.<br>
Effluent from. the ammoxidation reactor is cooled in a quench tower with an acidified water stream by counter-current contact. Gases from the quench tower are , transferred into the bottom of an absorber where acrylonitrile, acetonitrile and other relatively soluble gases are absorbed. The non-absorbed gases are vented.<br>
The stream from the bottom of the absorber, known as the rich water stream, is transferred into a recovery column where it is extractively distilled. The recovery column may be any suitable contacting means in which liquid and vapor are counter-currently contacted in a multiplicity of communicating zones or stages. The overhead vapors from the recovery column are enriched in acrylonitrile, other components being chiefly water and hydrogen cyanide, and contaminated with undesirable impurities such as nitrites, compounds which have characteristics of nitrites, and precursors thereof. The overhead vapors are condensed and collected in a decanter, the liquid undergoes liquid—liquid phase separation, the less dense layer being an organic phase, the denser lower layer being an aqueous phase. The organic phase being chiefly acrylonitrile contaminated with water and hydrogen cyanide, is withdrawn for further purification. The aqueous phase is refluxed to the upper section of the recovery column.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention can include known treatments of process streams. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,442,771 disclosed a process for removal of trace impurities (e.g. nitrites,   peroxides   and   precursors   thereof)   from   unsaturated<br><br><br><br><br><br>
15 <br>
mononitriles (e.g. acrylonitrile) contaminated with waiter which process uses the addition of an alkaline solution to the partially condensed azeotrope of the unsaturated nitrile and water where the azeotrope has been obtained as an overhead stream; obtained from an extractive distillation column, in particular, the recovery column. The effect of the alkaline solution is to extract the reaction product of the trace impurities into the aqueous phase of the azeotrope leaving the organic phase relatively impurity-free. The azeotrope is then transferred into a decanter where liquid-liquid phase separation occurs. The organic phase containing crude acrylonitrile is then removed, for further purification while the aqueous phase containing the reaction products is recycled to the recovery column.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention one or more of the aqueous recycle streams is treated with an acid to reduce the pH. Preferably, the acid may be a mineral acid such as sulfuric or an organic acid such as acetic, acrylic, formic or glycol, determined by cost considerations, availability, compatibility, metallurgy, etc.<br>

invention. In particular, preferred embodiments of the invention which include ammoxidation of propylene with ammonia and a source of dioxygen, quenching the gaseous mixture from the ammoxidation with an aqueous quench liquid to obtain an aqueous solution comprising acrylonitrile, hydrogen; cyanide, acetonitrile and other organic co-products, and an integrated sequence of distillations and phase separations to recover and purify the acrylonitrile product, recover hydrogen cyanide and, optionally, acetonitrile products are illustrated and/or described;<br>
As embodied and broadly described herein, the process of the present invention comprises reacting an olefin selected from the group consisting of propylene and isobutylene, ammonia and oxygen in a reactor zone in the presence of a catalyst to produce a reactor effluent containing the corresponding unsaturated mononitrile (i.e. acrylonitrile of methacrylonitrile), transferring the reactor effluent containing the unsaturated mononitrile to a quench column wherein the reactor effluent containing the unsaturated mononitrile is contacted with at least a first aqueous stream to cool the reactor effluent, transferring the cooled reactor effluent containing the unsaturated mononitrile to an absorption column wherein the reactor effluent containing unsaturated mononitrile is contacted with at least a second aqueous stream to separate and remove the unsaturated mononitrile as a bottom stream from the absorption column, transferring the bottom stream containing the unsaturated mononitrile to a recovery and purification section where the unsaturated mononitrile is recovered and purified, and recycling at least one aqueous process stream to improve the efficiency of the process.<br>
The invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiments so described, and the scope of the invention will be pointed out in the appended claims.<br>
Apparatus of this invention is used with certain conventional components the details of which, although not fully illustrated or described, will be apparent to those having skill in the art and an understanding of the necessary function of such<br><br>
17 <br>
components. Examples of plant ancillaries not illustrated or described include; facilities for preparation and distribution of polymerization inhibitor and/or solutions thereof, steam ejector or vacuum pump systems to maintain the required operating pressures for distillations at mild conditions of temperature, collection and disposal systems for waste liquids, and emergency vent systems.<br>
Preferably processes of this invention derive a suitable gaseous mixture from the air oxidation of an olefin selected from the group consisting of propylene and isobutylene over a solid, particulate catalyst in the presence of ammonia. A suitable sources of olefin can contain up to about 15 percent of the corresponding alkane, typically from about 2 to about 10 percent, and up to about 5 percent heavier hydrocarbon compounds, and preferably  less than about 2 percent.<br>
For best results the ammoxidation process is carried out in<br>
a fluid-bed reactor, for best results. Because of the high olefin<br>
conversions obtained, a single pass system is typically<br>
satisfactory.	Approximately     stoichiometric     quantities     of<br>
propylene, ammonia, and dioxygen are introduced into a fluidized bed of catalytic particles. Suitable operating conditions include pressures in a range from about 3 to about 35 psig (20.7 to 241.4 kPa gage), more preferably from about 5 to about 25 psig (34.5 to 172.4 kPa gage). Generally, temperatures are in a range from about 700° to 1000° *F (371° to 538° C), preferable in a range from about 750° to 950° F (399° to 510° C). Heat of reaction is is removed by generation of steam to control the temperature and generating steam at temperatures of from about 300° to about 500° Celevated pressure.<br>
Advantageously, the oxidations are operated at the lowest temperature consistent with high conversion. Conversion increases with temperature; the selectivity generally decreases only with large increases in temperature. Catalyst life also decreases with increasing temperatures. Catalysts are designed to give high performance   over a range  of operating  conditions<br>
18 <br>
permitting gradual  increase of temperature  over the ,j operating<br>
life of the catalysts to maintain productivity and selectivity near<br><br>
the initial levels, thus compensating for gradual loss of catalvst activity.<br>
Because commercial   catalysts   achieve  high conyersion Of<br>
propylene to acrylonitrile, once-through operation! of the ammoxidation reactor with a residence time of a few seconds is typical. Commercially recoverable quantities of acetonitrile and hydrocyanic acid are optional co-products.<br>
Effluent from the ammoxidation reactor is cooled and is scrubbed with water in a counter-current, absorbing system from which off-gas, consisting chiefly of nitrogen, is vented. Organic' products, primarily acrylonitrile, acetonitrile and HCN, are collected in water to give up to about 8 percent aqueous, acrylonitrile and co-products, preferably from about 2.5 to about 7.5 percent, more preferably from about 3 to about 7 percent of acrylonitrile and co-products, for best results.<br>
The aqueous solution of acrylonitrile and co-products is treated in an integrated system of distillation and phase separation steps by which organic products are recovered and at least acrylonitrile is refined. The aqueous solution is sent to the acrylonitrile recovery column, from which an overhead stream containing crude acrylonitrile and HCN is recovered. A liquid side stream from the column is fractionated in a small column to the remove acetonitrile as a co-product or, more typically, for disposal by incineration. Water is removed from the bottom of the acrylonitrile recovery column. Condensate from the overhead stream is separated, and the HCN removed in the overhead of the heads column. The acrylonitrile in the bottoms is further purified in the product column to obtain fiber-grade acrylonitrile.<br>
More specifically with reference to the FIGURE, which is a schematic illustration of an integrated distillation means for obtaining valuable acrylonitrile product and hydrogen cyanide according  to a preferred   embodiment   of the   invention,   where<br>

EXAMPLES OF THE INVENTION<br>
The following Examples will serve to illustrate certain specific embodiments of the herein disclosed invention! These Examples should not, however, be construed as limiting the scope of the novel invention as there are many" variations which may be made thereon without departing from the spirit of the disclosed invention, as those of skill in the art will recognize.<br>
Equipment<br>
An internally heated cell was used to screen polymerization inhibitors. A Hach 2100 AN turbidimeter connected to; a strip chart was used to detect solution turbidity. The acrylonitrile used was distilled prior to use. A constant temperature bath was used to circulate the hot water/ethylene glycol solution through the heated cell to maintain the desired temperature where the turbidity was monitored.<br>
General Procedure<br>
Antioxidants were used as received from the supplier. 2,2-Azo-bis-isobutyronitrile (AIBN) was the free radical source. The general method for testing involved preparing a mixture of freshly    distilled    acrylonitrile,    an    inhibitor    and    AIBN   and<br>
23<br><br>
subjecting   this   mixture   to   an   elevated   temperature   while monitoring turbidity.<br>
Examples 1 - 3<br>
These examples demonstrate the use of N,N'-di-sec-butyl-/?-phenylenediamine, identified below as DBPA inhibitor.<br>
Example 1<br>
A mixture of 18.94 grams of acrylonitrile and 0.00241 grams of DBPA inhibitor were placed in the hot tube and 0.0266 grams of AIBN was then added to the mixture. The mixture was heated to 65°C and the turbidity was monitored. The onset of turbidity occurred after 228 minutes. The molar ratio of AIBN to DBPA inhibitor was 15<br>
Example 2<br>
Example 1 was repeated except that the molar ratio of AIBN to DBPA inhibitor was 22. The onset of turbidity occurred after 150 minutes.'<br>
Example 3<br>
Example 1 was repeated except that the molar ratio of AIBN to DBPA inhibitor was 29. The onset of turbidity occurred after 128 minutes.<br>
Comparative Examples A'- C<br>
These comparative examples are to illustrate the use of compounds which are hydroxy derivatives of benzene having an OH group is attached directly to a benzene ring, i.e., phenols, to inhibit polymerization.<br>
Comparative Example A.<br>
A mixture of 18.97 grams of acrylonitrile and 0.00232 grams of hydroquinone (p-dihydroxybenzene, M.P. 170.3°C) were placed in the hot tube and 0.0554 grams of AIBN was then added to the mixture.   The mixture was heated to 65°C and the turbidity<br>
24<br><br>
was monitored.   The onset of turbidity occurred after 74 minutes. The molar ratio of AIBN to inhibitor was 16.<br>
Comparative Example B.<br>
Comparative Example A was repeated except that the molar ratio of AIBN to inhibitor was 18. The onset of turbidity occurred after 56 minutes.<br>
Comparative Example C.<br>
Comparative Example A was repeated except that the molar ratio of AIBN to inhibitor was 31. The onset of turbidity occurred after 20 minutes.<br>
These data show that the time to onset of turbity, over range for the molar ratio of AIBN to inhibitor of 15 to 30, the use of N,N'-di-sec-butyl-p-phenylenediamine was 3 to 4 2/3 times longer than using hydroquinone.<br>
Comparative Example D<br>
A mixture of 19.26 grams of acrylonitrile and 0.00087 grams of hydroquinone and 0.00106 grams of DBPA inhibitor were placed in the hot tube and 0.0500 grams of AIBN was then added to the mixture. The mixture was heated to 65°C and the turbidity was monitored. The onset of turbidity occurred after 74 minutes.   The molar ratio of AIBN to inhibitor was 24.<br>
This comparative example shows that using a combination of hydroquinone (p-dihydroxybenzene) and the AIBN inhibitor of the invention (N,N'-di-sec-butyl-/p-phenylenediamine) decreased the time to onset of turbity to about 1/2 of the time using AIBN alone.<br>
Example 4<br>
A mixture of 18.38 grams of acrylonitrile and 0.00241 grams of DBPA inhibitor and 0.01862 grams of glacial acetic acid were placed in the hot tube and 0.0492 grams of AIBN was then added to the mixture. The mixture was heated to 65°C ,;and the turbidity was monitored.    The onset of turbidity  occurred  after<br><br><br><br><br>
25 <br>
130 minutes.   The molar ratio of AIBN to inhibitor was 27.   Acetic<br>
i<br>
acid can be used in the process to control pH and this example demonstrates that acetic acid does not adversely impact the performance of DBPA inhibitor.<br>
Example 5<br>
A mixture of 19.09 grams of acrylonitrile and 0.00244 grams of DBPA inhibitor and 0.00156 grams of acrylic acid were placed in the hot tube and 0.0515 grams of AIBN was then added-to the mixture. The mixture was heated to 65°C and the turbidity was monitored. The onset of turbidity occurred after 129 minutes. The molar ratio of AIBN to inhibitor was 28. Acrylic acid is a co-product that can be produced and this example demonstrates that acrylic acid does not adversely impact the performance of DBPA inhibitor.<br>
Comparative Example E<br>
This comparative example is to illustrate the use of an amine compound which has two benzene rings, i.e., diphenylamine, to inhibit polymerization. A mixture of 19.95 grams of acrylonitrile and 0.00184 grams of diphenylamine (MP. 52°C) were placed in the hot tube and 0.0363 grams of AIBN was then added to the mixture. The mixture was heated to 65°C and the turbidity was monitored. The onset of turbidity occurred after 84 minutes.   The molar ratio of AIBN to inhibitor was 20.<br>
Comparative Examples F &amp; G<br>
These comparative examples are to illustrate the very poor results obtained in comparable use of compounds which are derivatives of hydroxyamine to inhibit polymerization.<br>
Example F<br>
A mixture of 20.46 grams of acrylonitrile and 0.00201 grams of N,N-diethylhydroxylamine were placed in the hot tube and 0.040 . grams of AIBN was then added to the mixture. The mixture was heated to 65°C and the turbidity  was  monitored.<br>
26<br><br>
The onset of turbidity occurred after 10 minutes.   The molar ratio of AIBN to inhibitor was 11.<br>
Example G<br>
Example 5 was repeated except that the molar ratio of AIBN to inhibitor was 4. The onset of turbidity occurred after 14 minutes.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, "fractional distillation" is defined as a method to separate a mixture of ' several volatile components of different boiling points; the mixture is distilled at the lowest boiling point, and the distillate is collected as one fraction until the temperature of the vapor rises showing that the composition of the vapor being distilled has changed: this vapor is collected as a separate fraction. "Fractionation" is defined as separation of a mixture in successive stages, each stage removing from the mixture some proportion of one of the substances as by distillation. Unless indicated otherwise, "column" is defined as an apparatus used widely for continuous separation of fluid (gaseous or liquid) components by vapor-liquid fractionation.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, "predominantly" is defined as more than about fifty per cent. "Substantially" is defined as occurring with sufficient frequency or being present in such proportions as to measurably affect macroscopic properties of an associated compound or system. Where the frequency or proportion for such impact is not clear substantially is to be regarded as about twenty per cent or more. The term "Essentially" is defined as absolutely except that small variations which have no more than a negligible effect on macroscopic qualities and final outcome are permitted, typically up to about one percent.<br>
