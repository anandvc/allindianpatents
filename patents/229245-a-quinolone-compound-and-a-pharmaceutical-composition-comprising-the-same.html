				<td>Field of the Invention:<br>
rhe present invention relates to a novel quinolone derivative or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition thereof useful as a pharmaceutical agent, particularly a platelet aggregation inhibitor and a P2Y12 inhibitor.<br>
Background and prior art<br>
Since platelet was discovered in 1842 by Donne, platelet has been considered as one blood component required for hemostasis for a long time.    Presently, it is demonstrated that platelet not only just plays a principle role in die hemostatic mechanism but also exerts multi-functionality for example in the establishment of arteriosclerosis having been drawing clinical attention and the involvement in circulatory diseases including thrombotic diseases, cancer metastasis, inflammations, and post-graft rejections, and additionally in immune reactions.<br>
Generally, therapies for blood reperfusion with pharmaceutical agents or physical methods have been done for thrombotic diseases and ischemic diseases.    However, it has been found in recent years that phenomena such as the elevation of platelet activation, adhesion and aggregation occur after blood reperfusion, for example via the rupture of vascular tissues including endothelial cells or the deterioration of the balance between fibrinogenolysis and coagulation with pharmaceutical agents themselves.    Clinically, such phenomena have drawn attention.    It has also been revealed that after reperfusion is established with thrombolysis using for example t-PA, fibrinolysis potency and coagulation potency are activated, leading to the deterioration of the balance between systemic coagulation and fibrinolysis.    Clinically, such phenomena induce re-occlusion and cause serious clinical problems    (non-patent reference 1).<br>
Meanwhile, PTCA and stenting have spread rapidly for the therapeutic treatment of diseases based on the constrictions of coronary artery and aorta, including for example angina and myocardial infarction, to give certain fruitful results.    However, these therapies disadvantageously damage vascular tissues including endothelial cells, so that acute coronary occlusion and restenosis emerging at chronic stage draw serious concerns.    Platelet plays an important role in various thrombotic disorders (re-occlusion and the like) after blood reperfusion therapy.    Therefore, anti-platelet agents<br><br><br>
efficacious in these cases are now desired.   However, anti-platelet agents in the related art have not yet been verified to be sufficiently effective.<br>
As the prophylactic or therapeutic agents of these circulatory diseases, platelet aggregation inhibitors such as aspirin, indometacin, cilostazol, prostaglandin Ij, prostaglandin EI, ticlopidine, and dipyridamole have been used. Recently, GPIIb/IIIa antagonists inhibiting the final stage of platelet aggregation and having a potent platelet aggregation-inhibiting activity has additionally been developed. The application thereof is however limited to intravenous infusion at the acute stage of thrombosis (non-patent reference 2).<br>
It has been elucidated in recent years concerning ticlopidine for use as an anti-platelet agent that an active metabolite thereof can exert its platelet aggregation-inhibiting action by inhibiting P2Y12 as an ADP receptor.    Reports have subsequently been issued, telling triazolo[4,5-DJpyrimidine derivative (patent reference 1) and piperidine and/or homopiperazine (patent reference 2 and patent reference 3) as compounds with the P2Y12-inhibiting action.<br>
Anti-microbial compounds represented by the formula (A) have been known as quinolone derivatives (patent reference 4),   However, it has never been known that these derivatives have a platelet aggregation-inhibiting action.<br>

Disclosure of the Invention<br>
In such circumstances, it is strongly desired to develop an anti-platelet agent with a high safety profile with a smaller adverse bleeding effect and with distinct pharmaceutical efficacies. Thus, it is an object of the invention to provide a platelet aggregation inhibitor and a P2Y12 inhibitor having a high pharmacological effect and a good balance between the pharmacological effect and the safety profile, and a novel compound useful as a platelet aggregation inhibitor and a P2Y12 inhibitor having a high pharmacological effect and a good balance between the pharmacological effect and the safety profile.<br>
Thus, the invention has been achieved.<br>
The present inventors made investigations so as to overcome the problems.    The inventors found that a quinolone derivative represented by the following formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is a compound with a novel skeleton and with an excellent platelet aggregation-inhibiting action and a P2Y12-inhibiting action.<br>
Specifically, the invention relates to a platelet aggregation inhibitor comprising a quinolone derivative represented by the formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as the active ingredient:<br>

After C6-15 cells were inoculated on a DMEM culture medium to 1 x 106 cells in a 10-cm petri dish for culturing for one day, where 8 \ig of a plasmid pEF-BOS-dhfr-human P2Y12 and 0.8 ^g of pEF-BOS-neo (Nucleic Acid Res., 18,5322, 1990) were genetically introduced with a transfection reagent (LipofectAMINE 2000; manufactured by GIBCO BRL).<br>
24 hours after the gene introduction procedure described above, the cells with the gene introduced therein were recovered and suspended in a DMEM culture medium containing 0.6 mg/ml G418 (manufactured by GIBCO BRL), to prepare serial dilutions, which were inoculated on a 10-cm petri dish.   Colonies appearing 2 weeks later were individually obtained and defined as C6-15 cell expressing the protein P2Y12, for use in the following experiment (WO 02/36631, Mol. Pharmacol., 60,432,2001).<br>
The C6-15 cell expressing the protein P2Y12 was cultured and recovered.    After the cell was rinsed with PBS, the cell was suspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 containing 5 mmol/1 EDTA and a protease inhibitor cocktail set Complete™ (manufactured by Boehringer Mannheim GmbH) and then homogenized with Polytron.   After ultra-centrifugation, the resulting precipitate was suspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 containing 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl and Complete™.    The resulting suspension was defined as a membrane fraction.<br>
1.5 (4.1 of an active ingredient or compound of the invention and 50 ul of 0.75 nM [3H]-2-MeS-ADP (80 Ci/mmol; manufactured by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added to 100 |4,1 of the P2Y12 protein-expressing C6-15 cell membrane fraction (100 u.g/ml) thus prepared, for incubation in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 containing 100 mM NaCl and 50 mM MgCl2, at ambient temperature for one hour.    Subsequently, the incubation mixture was recovered onto a glass filter with a cell harvester. Adding a microscintillator onto the glass filter, the radioactivity was assayed with a liquid scintillation<br>
counter. At the test, additionally, the radioactivity levels of such cell cultures with no addition of the compound and with addition of 1.5 ul of 100 uM 2-MeS-ADP were assayed as total binding and nonspecific binding, respectively. Defining the total binding and the non-specific binding at inhibition ratios of 0% and 100%, respectively the inhibition ratio (%) of an active ingredient or compound in accordance with the invention was calculated. The results from an active ingredient or the compound of the invention at 30 nM (final concentration) are shown in Table 2.<br>

In such solid composition, one or more active substances are mixed with at least one inactive diluent type, including for example lactose, mannitol, glucose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and magnesium metasilicate aluminate.   The composition may satisfactorily contain additives other than the inactive diluents, for example lubricants such as magnesium stearate, disintegrators such as fibrin calcium glycolate, stabilizers and auxiliary agents for dissolution.   If necessary, the tablets and pills may be coated with sugar coatings of sucrose, gelatin, hydroxypropyl cellulose, and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate or with films dissolvable in stomach or intestine.<br>
The liquid composition for oral administration contains for example pharmaceutically acceptable emulsifiers, fluids, suspending agents, syrups and elixirs and also contain inactive diluents for general use, including for example distilled water, and ethanol (EtOH).    The composition may satisfactorily contain auxiliary agents such as emollients and suspending agents, sweeteners, flavors, aromatic agents and preservatives other than the inactive diluents.<br>
The injections for parenteral administration contain sterile, aqueous or non-aqueous fluids, suspending agents and emulsifiers.   The aqueous fluids and the suspending agents include for example distilled water for injections and physiological saline.   The non-aqueous fluids and suspending agents include for example propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils such as olive oil, alcohols such as EtOH, polysorbate 80.    Such composition further may contain preservatives, emollients, emulsifiers, dispersants, stabilizers and auxiliary agents for dissolution. These are sterilized by for example filtration through bacteria-deposit filters, blending of sterilizing agents or irradiation.    These may also be used in a form of a sterile solid composition, which is preliminarily dissolved in sterile water or sterile solvents for injections.<br>
