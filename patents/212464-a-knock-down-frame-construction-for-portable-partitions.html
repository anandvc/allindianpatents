KNOCK-DOWN PORTABLE PARTITION SYSTEM BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to office partition panel systems, and in particular to a knock-down portable partition that has a unique post and beam construction configured for quick and easy on-site manual assembly without tools.<br>
The efficient use of building floor space is an ever growing concern, particularly as building costs continue to escalate.   Open office plans have been developed to reduce overall off icing costs, and generally incorporate large, open floor spaces in buildings that are equipped with modular furniture systems which are readily reconfigurable to accommodate the ever changing needs of a specific user, as well as the divergent requirements of different tenants.   One arrangement commonly used for furnishing open plans includes movable or portable partition panels that are detachably interconnected to partition off the open spaces into individual workstations and/or offices.   Such partition panels are configured to receive hang-on furniture units, such as worksurfaces, overhead cabinets, shelves, etc., and are generally known in the office furniture industry as "systems furniture".<br>
Numerous partition panel systems have been developed for dividing office workspaces into smaller areas.   Partition panel systems, like those disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,996,811, utilize prefabricated rectangular partition panel members that have a unitary rigid perimeter frame with decorative cover panels fastened opposite sides thereof.   Each perimeter frame member has a rectangular shape, and is fabricated and shipped as a single unit, often with the decorative cover panels pre-fastened to the frame. During installation, the prefabricated perimeter frame of each panel member is fastened to the perimeter frame of an adjacent panel member along the vertical edges thereof, either directly, or by a separate fastener post.   Each partition panel member includes two height adjustable feet or glides along the bottom edge of each panel member, with one glide being located adjacent each vertical panel edge.   Since there are two vertical frame members at each panel joint, this type of panel construction results in structural redundancy.   In addition, since each glide must be properly adjusted for height, this configuration requires adjustment of both glides at each panel joint during assembly. Furthermore, although longer panels typically have a lower cost per unit length, longer panels are difficult to handle, which places a practical limit on the size of the partition panel member that can be shipped and installed as a prefabricated unit.<br><br>
Other partition panel systems, like that disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,150,554, utilize prefabricated rectangular partition panel members having a unitary perimeter frame that attaches to a post member along each vertical panel edge.  Although this type of design may have a single glide at each post, each panel-to-post connection has at least two vertical structural members.  Since only a single vertical member is needed to provide support and height adjustment, this type of system has redundant structure.  In addition, the rectangular partition panel members are manufactured and shipped as a unit, limiting the size of the partition panel members that can be used.<br>
Other office divider systems, like that disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,406,760, utilize vertical posts and horizontal beams wherein each post attaches to an adjacent post along adjacent vertical edges.  Since each post is attached directly to an adjacent post, this configuration also has redundant vertical structural members and glides.<br>
Other office panel dividers, like that disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,287,666 and 5,219,406, have multiple posts and beams with connector members that hold a pair of beams to adjacent posts.  This configuration has two horizontal beams in a side-by-side relationship at each height location, and also has two vertical posts attached directly together in either a back-to-back or side-by-side relationship.  Thus, there is redundancy in both the post and the beam structures.  In addition, connector pieces are required to attach the beams to the posts.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
One aspect of the present invention is a knock-down portable partition comprising a panel frame with a rigid perimeter having a substantially open central portion with quick-disconnect connectors thereon.  At least one cover panel covers at least a portion of the open central portion of the panel frame.  The cover panel has quick-disconnect connectors which mate with the quick-disconnect connectors on the panel frame to facilitate manual assembly and removal of the cover panel on the panel frame.  The panel frame has at least two vertical posts, with at least two beam connection ports positioned adjacent upper and lower portions of the posts on the opposite side faces thereof.   Each of the beam connection ports includes a window extending through an associated side face of the post and includes first and second horizontally aligned fastener apertures positioned in the front and rear faces of the posts adjacent opposite sides of the window.   The panel frame also has at least two structural beams rigidly yet detachably interconnecting the vertical posts adjacent the upper and lower portions thereof.   Each end of each of the<br><br>
beams has a shape similar to the shape of the window for close reception therein.   Each end of each of the beams also has a notch extending transversely of the beam through a lower portion thereof in which a lower edge of the port window is closely received to longitudinally lock each of the beams in the posts.  Each end of each beam further includes a third fastener aperture extending transversely through the beam, at a location spaced apart from the notch, and in horizontal alignment with the first and second fastener apertures.   A plurality of fastener pins are closely yet manually received in the first, second and third fastener apertures of each of the beam connection ports to positively retain the beams locked in the posts, whereby the portable partition can be completely assembled and disassembled without the use of screwdrivers, wrenches, or similar tools.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention is a knock-down portable partition comprising at least two vertical posts, each having a plurality of utility trough ports with windows for passing utility conduits therethrough.  At least two structural beams are provided, each having opposite ends interconnecting the vertical posts adjacent upper and lower ends to define, when in an assembled condition, a rigid panel frame having a substantially open interior.  A cover panel is removably mounted on the panel frame to readily access the open interior thereof.   The partition includes at least one utility trough shaped to receive and retain utility conduits.   Opposite ends of the utility trough can be detachably connected to a pair of utility trough ports when the panel frame is in an assembled condition.<br>
Yet another aspect of the present invention is a knock-down portable partition comprising at least two vertical end posts having a plurality of beam connection ports on a vertical face of each end post.   Another vertical post is located intermediate the end posts and includes beam connection ports on first and second vertical faces.  At least four structural beams which rigidly interconnect each vertical end post to an intermediate post adjacent the upper and lower ends.   The vertical posts and structural beams define rigid panel frames having a substantially open interior, the structural beams providing the primary structural interconnection between the intermediate post and the end posts.   At least two cover panels that are removably mounted on the panel frame enclose at least a portion of the interior of the panel frames.<br>
Yet another aspect of the present invention is a knock-down portable partition comprising two vertical posts and two structural beams.   Each structural beam has at least<br><br>
two longitudinally extending tabs which are received in a pair of slots extending through a side face of the post.  A plurality of fastener pins are closely yet manually received in first and second pairs of horizontally aligned fastener apertures positioned adjacent opposite sides of each said slot in front and rear faces of the posts, and also through a third pair of fastener apertures which extend transversely through the beam.  The vertical posts and structural beams form a panel frame having a rigid perimeter with a substantially open central portion which is covered by at least one cover panel which is retained with quick-disconnect connectors.<br>
The principal objects of the present invention are to provide a knock-down, portable partition system.  Accordingly, the present partition provides a versatile, easily assembled and disassembled partition having reduced complexity, and fewer components. The individual components are assembled at the installation site, thereby reducing shipping costs, and allowing for longer, more economical panel sizes.   The partition panel is easily and quickly assembled without the use of hand tools.   Utility troughs may be installed at various heights between the posts to provide for electrical and communications conduits.   The utility troughs may be installed or removed after the structural beams are installed between adjacent posts.  Removable cover panels are installed to close off the open interior of the panel.   Two adjacent cover panels are attached to a single post at each in-line panel joint.<br>
These and other features, objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent upon reading the following description thereof together with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>

For purposes of description herein, the terms "upper", "lower", "right", "left", "rear", "front", "vertical", "horizontal", and derivatives thereof shall relate to the invention as oriented in Fig. 1.  However, it is to be understood that the invention may assume various alternative orientations and step sequences, except where expressly specified to the contrary.  It is also to be understood that the specific devices and processes illustrated in the attached drawings, and described in the following specification are simply exemplary embodiments of the inventive concepts defined in the appended claims.   Hence, specific dimensions and other physical characteristics relating to the embodiments disclosed herein are not to be considered as limiting, unless the claims<br><br>
expressly state otherwise.<br>
The reference numeral 1 (Fig. 1) generally designates a knock-down portable partition system embodying the present invention.  The illustrated knock-down portable partition system 1 has cover panels 11, 12 supported on a post and beam framework 2 (Fig. 5) designed for quick and easy on-site manual assembly without tools.   Framework 2 includes at least two vertical posts 20 with at least two beam connection ports 30 on opposite side faces 14 adjacent upper and lower portions of the posts.  Each beam connection port 30 (Fig. 14) has a window 34 through the side face 14 of post 20, and first and second horizontally aligned fastener apertures 32 and 33 in front and rear faces 27 and 28 of the post 20 adjacent opposite sides of the window 34.   At least two structural beams 35 rigidly, yet detachably interconnect vertical posts 20 at the upper and lower portions thereof (Fig. 5).  Each end of each of the structural beams 35 (Fig. 14) is shaped for close reception in an associated post window 34, and includes a vertically oriented, transverse notch 39 through a lower portion of the beam 35 in which a lower edge of the post window 34 is closely received to longitudinally lock each beam 35 in its associated post 20 (Fig. 16).  Each structural beam end also has a third fastener aperture 36 that is spaced from the notch 39, and is horizontally aligned with the two post apertures 32 and 33.  Fastener pins 31 (Fig. 13) are closely, yet manually received in the first, second and third fastener apertures 32, 33, and 36 of each of the beam connection ports 30 to positively retain the beams 35 locked in the posts 20, such that the partition system 1 can be completely assembled and disassembled manually without tools.   Utility troughs 45 (Figs. 18-21) shaped to retain wires, cabling, etc. therein have first and second ends 57 and 58 that are shaped to be detachably mounted in horizontally aligned pairs of utility trough ports 40 on the posts 20 while the framework 2 is in its assembled condition (Fig. 5).<br>
Four different post configurations are utilized, including an in-line or end-of-run post 20, a T-post 71, L-post 81, and X-post 91.  Each of the post configurations has a plurality of beam connection ports 30 and utility trough connection ports 40 located on side faces 14 in a similar arrangement as the vertical post 20 described below.  With reference to Figs. 3-5, each vertical post 20 may be used for an in-line joint 19, or at an end-of-run location, where the vertical post 20 is covered by a vertical trim strip 60. Structural beams 35 are received into structural beam connection ports 30 located on the vertical faces of a pair of vertical posts 20.  Pins 31 are received in first, second and<br><br>
third horizontally aligned fastener apertures 32, 33, and 36, rigidly locking the structural beams to the vertical posts 20.  Base covers 16 may be made from roll-formed steel sheet, and include retainer tabs 18 which removably retain the base cover 16 in base cover mounting slots 23, located at the lower end of vertical posts 20.   Base covers 16 include apertures 17 for receiving electrical receptacles 50.   Since each post 20 receives at least two structural beams 35 into the connection ports 30 on both opposite side faces 14 at an in-line joint 19, each panel frame 3 shares a common vertical post 20 with an adjacent panel frame 3.  Each panel frame 3 may include either segmented cover panels 11, or a single cover panel 12 to form a panel section 10.<br>
With reference to Figs. 6-9, each vertical post 20 has a plurality of structural beam connection ports 30, and a plurality of utility trough connection ports 40 on each opposite side face 14.  The upper utility trough 41 is similar to utility trough connection port 40, but includes an open upper edge for laying-in cabling along the upper edge of panel sections 10.  First quick-disconnect connectors are formed by a plurality of cover panel mounting slots 22 which are evenly spaced along the front and rear faces 27, 28 of the vertical post 20 near the opposite side faces 14.  Base cover mounting slots 23 are located on front and rear faces 27 and 28 near the lower end of vertical posts 20.  As shown in Fig. 9, each foot or glide 25 is threadingly received into a glide plate 26.   The rectangular glide plate 26 is welded into the lower end of vertical post 20.  Each in-line vertical post 20 has a rectangular tubular cross-section as illustrated in Fig. 8.<br>
With reference to Figs. 10-12, each structural beam 35 has a square or rectangular tubular cross section and includes a vertically oriented notch 39 extending transversely. A third fastener aperture 36 is located adjacent each end of the structural beam 35.   As shown in Fig. 14, each structural beam connection port 30 includes a window 34 defined by an edge having a shape similar to that of structural beams 35 for receiving an end of the structural beams 35.   The vertically oriented transverse notch 39 has a width that is approximately equal to the thickness of the wall of the vertical post 20, resulting in a frictional engagement when the notch 39 is engaged on the lower edge of a window 34. Each structural beam connection port 30 includes first and second horizontally aligned fastener apertures 32 and 33 which receive pin 31 when a structural beam 35 is received in the window 34.<br>
Each pin 31 is made from flat metal stock, and has a profile as illustrated in Fig. 13.   Contact surfaces 38 engage the upper and lower edges of first, second and third<br><br>
fastener apertures 32, 33 and 36 with a minimal clearance, thereby providing a rigid, secure connection between the structural beam 35 and vertical post 20 and also allowing insertion and removal of the pin 31 without use of tools.   Narrow intermediate section 37 provides clearance to facilitate installation of pin 31.   Stops 47 contact the front or rear face 27 or 28 of post 20 when the pin 31 is folly engaged.  Circular aperture 46 receives a tool such as a screwdriver to aid in the removal of pin 31 if required.<br>
As illustrated in Figs. 15-17, during assembly of the framework 2, each end of a structural beam 35 is inserted into the window 34 of a structural beam connection port 30.   The structural beam 35 is then pressed downward to engage the lower edge of window 34 into the vertically oriented transverse notch 39.  The first, second and third fastener apertures 32, 33 and 36 are then horizontally aligned, and a pin 31 is inserted through the fastener apertures, thereby securely locking the structural beam to the vertical post.   Each vertical post 20 that is used at an in-line joint 19 receives structural beam 35 into each of the opposite faces, such that each adjacent panel frame 3 shares a common vertical post 20.<br>
As shown in Figs. 18-20, each utility trough 45 may be roll-formed from a pre-coated roll of steel and has an inverted U-shaped cross section that extends substantially uninterrupted between a pair of posts 20.  Each utility trough 45 includes horizontal flanges 48 along the upper edge.   The horizontal flanges 48 are configured to provide support for a cover panel 11 or 12,  and have a cut-out portion 56 near each end of the utility trough 45 to provide clearance for the frame 100 of cover panel 11 or 12.   Vertical tabs 49 and horizontal tab 51 are located at a first end 57 of the utility trough 45.  Hook-shaped tabs 53 are located at a second end 58 of utility trough 45, and define a tapered, vertically-oriented slot 54.<br>
With reference to Fig. 21, each utility trough connection port 40 includes a window 42 for passing electrical or communications conduit through the vertical post 20. A pair of vertically-oriented slots 43 receive the vertical tabs 49 or hook-shaped tabs 53 of a utility trough 45.   Each utility trough connection port 40 also includes a horizontally oriented slot 44 that receives horizontal tab 51 when the first end 57 of a utility trough 45 is inserted.<br>
Utility troughs 45 are installed after the framework 2 is assembled from posts 20 and beams 35.   As illustrated in Figs. 22-25, during installation the first end 57 of utility trough 45 is slid into the vertical slots 43 and horizontal slot 44 of a utility trough<br><br>
connection port 40.   The second end 58 of utility trough 45 is then rotated downward to partially engage hook-shaped tabs 53 into slots 43 and shifted in a horizontal direction to engage the tapered, vertically oriented slots 54 into the bottom edge of vertically oriented slots 43.   In a similar manner, utility trough 45 may be removed from a pair of vertical posts 20 after the framework 2 has been assembled.  When in an installed condition, utility troughs 45 are aligned with the windows 42 in vertical post 20 to allow electrical or communications cabling to pass therethrough.<br>
As illustrated in Figs. 26 and 29, at an end-of-run location, a vertical post 20 receives a vertical trim strip 60.   Trim strip 60 includes hooks 61 which are received in vertical slots 43 of a utility trough connection port 40 or 41.  Vertical trim strip 60 extends away from vertical post 20 to provide an external vertical raceway 63 for laying-in of wires along an outer face of the vertical post 20.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 28, bracket 66 retains electrical receptacle 50 to the under side of a utility trough 45 located adjacent the lower edge of a panel section 10.  Flat electrical cable 65 runs along the base of panel sections 10, and passes over a front or rear face 27 or 28 of a vertical post 20, and is covered by base covers 16.<br>
As illustrated in Figs. 30-32, a frame 100 of cover panel 11 or 12 includes cover panel retainer tabs 105.  Each cover panel retainer tab 105 has a lance tab 106 which engages the inner surface of vertical post 20 when the cover panel retainer tab 105 is inserted into the cover panel mounting slots 22.  At each corner of frame 100, the channels 102 are joined with integrated rivets or "toggle locks" 101.   The retainer tabs 105 have a cross-sectional shape illustrated in Fig. 31.  As illustrated in Fig. 27, each vertical post 20 has two rows of cover panel mounting slots 22 on side faces 14 that receive cover panel retainer tabs 105 of cover panels 11.  Each vertical post 20 retains two adjacent edges of two cover panels 11 on each side face 14.<br>
As illustrated in Figs. 33-35, T-post 71, L-post 81 and X-post 91 are used at T-joints 70, L-joints 80 and X-joints 90, respectively.  All of the post configurations have a plurality of structural beam connection ports 30 and a plurality of utility trough connection ports 40 located on side faces 14 in substantially the same configuration as vertical post 20.   In addition, each of the post configurations has a plurality of vertical slots 22 for receiving cover panel retainer tabs 105 in substantially the same manner as vertical post 20.   All of the post configurations have a cross-sectional shape that receives a single-size glide plate 26 which is welded into a lower end of each post.  With<br><br>
reference to Fig. 33, each L-post 81 has an outer chamfered portion 84, and receives an L-post trim strip 82 over the outer chamfered portion 84 to form a vertical raceway 85.

Each tab 18 is received into a base cover mounting slot 23, located adjacent the lower end of a vertical post 20.   Each base cover mounting slot 23 receives two retainer tabs 18, one from each adjacent base cover 16.<br>
During assembly of the knock-down portable partition system 1, a pair of structural beams 35 are installed between a pair of vertical posts 20 to form panel frames 3.   After the post and beam framework 2 is assembled, the framework 2 is leveled by adjusting glides 25.   Alternatively, an L-post 81, or a T-post 71, or an X-post 91 may be used as the first vertical post in the assembly process for stability.   After the post and beam framework 2 is assembled, the utility troughs 45 are installed between each adjacent pair of posts at the desired height (Fig. 5).   The electrical and communications cabling may then be installed at the desired heights (Fig. 5, 36).   A flat electrical cable 65 and electrical receptacles 50 may be installed to a utility trough 45 located at the base of the framework 2.   The electrical receptacles 50 may be mounted to utility troughs 45 utilizing brackets 66 along the base of framework 2.   The flat electrical cables 65 are run across the front and/or rear faces of the vertical posts 20 (Fig. 36), and behind base covers 16. The cabling can be routed vertically either between panels through apertures 52 in utility troughs 45, or at a vertical post 20 at an end-of-run location.   Alternatively, the electrical and/or communications cabling may be run vertically at an L-post, T-post, or X-post as illustrated in Figs. 33-35.     In addition, cabling may be run vertically through the center of any of the vertical posts if required.   Cover panels 11 or 12 are then installed by<br><br>
inserting the tabs 105 into slots 22 in the vertical posts 20.   Base covers 16 are then snapped into slots 23 in the vertical posts 20.  If desired, knock-outs on the base cover are removed to create apertures 17 which provide clearance for the electrical receptacle 50.   The top trim strips 15 and the vertical post trim pieces 60, 72 and 82 may then be installed.<br>
