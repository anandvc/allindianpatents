				<td>The present invention is concerned with a novel process for the racemization of atropisomeric compounds of formula I,<br><br>
The optical active compounds of formula 1 above are known and are intermediates for the preparation of optically active bisphosphine ligands of formula II,<br><br>
which form optically active complexes with transition metals. These complexes are used as catalysts in a number of asymmetric reactions.<br><br>
In the synthesis of optically active intermediates of formula 1 and ligands of formula 11 performed by known processes usually a racemic mixture (mixture of equal amounts of both enantiomers) of the product, is obtained which has to be resolved for the preparation of the optical active ligands of formula II, which are used for the preparation of catalysts. The synthesis of optically active bisphosphine ligands of formula II thus involves the formation of a racemic mixture of the bis(phosphine oxide) of formula I, subsequent racemic resolution and reduction to obtain the desired enantiomer or reduction to the racemic bisphosphine of formula II followed by racemic resolution, The object of the invention is to provide a method to make use of the undesired enantiomer of the intermediate of formula I in order to improve the effiC1ency of the synthesis of optical active ligands of formula 11,<br>
The present invention is thus concerned with a novel process for the racemization of atropisomeric compounds of formula I,<br><br>
which are present in the (R) or (S) form or a non-racemic mixture of the (R) and (S) form and wherein<br><br><br>
characterized in that the racemization is thermal and carried out at a temperature from 260 to 400°C, preferably from 280 to 380°C.<br>
The term "racemization" signifies the transition of an optical active compound to the corresponding racemate, which signifies a mixture of equal amounts of both enantiomers.<br>
The term "atropisomeric" indicates the stereochemistry of compounds in which the free rotation along a bond is hindered and optical activity results. Atropisomerism is a speC1al case of axial chirality’s.<br>
The term "C1-8-alkyl" signifies in the scope of the present invention hydrocarbons with 1 to 8 carbon atoms, i.e. straight-chain or branched alkyl groups such as, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, tert.-butyl, pentyl, isopentyl, neopentyl, hexyl, isomerl, tert.-hexyl, heftily and octyl.<br>
The term "C1_s-alkoxy" signifies a C1-8-alkyl group as defined above which is bonded via an oxygen atom. Methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, isopropoxy, butoxy and the like can be mentioned as example.<br>
The term "substituted phenyl" signifies in the scope of the present invention phenyl groups which are monosubstituted in the meta- or para-position, preferably in the para-position. Suitable substituents for the phenyl group are C1.g-alkyl, preferably methyl; or C1-8-alkoxy, preferably methoxy; or di-C1.s-alkylamino, preferably dimetylamino; or trialkylsilyl, preferably trimethylsilyl; or substituted by a phenyl group.<br>
According to the invention, the racemization of the compounds of the formula I is carried out by heating the compound in a solvent or in the melt at a temperature from 260 to 400°C. The heating is carried out in a device which allows for heating up to 400°C. For small scale the heating can be carried out e.g. with a heating / stirring mantel, an aluminum heating block, an electrically heated reactor or autoclave and the like or by microwave irradiation. For larger scale the heating can be carried out e.g. in reactors or autoclaves. The reaction is carried out batchwise or in a continuous manner.<br>
In a preferred way, the racemization of the compounds of the formula I is carried out in a high boiling solvent at a temperature from 260 to 400°C batchwise or in a<br><br>
continuous manner and optionally under pressure at 10" to 3.5x107 Pa or preferably at 108 to 107 Pa.<br>
Suitable high boiling solvents are compounds of formula<br>
wherein R5 and R6 each independently signify hydrogen or lower alkyl (C2Q) and n is 2,3,4,5,6,7 or higher to signify a polyethylene chain.<br>
Examples of solvents of formula III are tetraethylene glycol, tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether, polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 350, polyethylene glycol dimethyl ether 400 or polyethylene glycol 350, polyethylene glycol 400, polyethylene glycol 550 and polyethylene glycol 725.<br>
Further suitable high boning solvents are solvents of formula<br><br>
wherein R and R is as mentioned above and<br>
wherein n is as mentioned above to signify)" a polypropylene)" chain.<br>
A preferred solvent of formula IV is polypropylene glycol 725.<br>
A further preferred solvent is polyoxyethylen-sorbitan-monooleal. The reaction can also be carried out in inorganic salt melts.<br>
In another preferred aspect of the invention the racemization of the compounds of the formula I is carried out in a low boiling organic solvent under pressure at 10 to 3.5x107 Pa, preferably at 105 to 10"" Pa. Suitable solvents are aromatic solvents like benzene, toluene, xylene, or alcohols like methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, or a mixture of the mentioned solvents. Preferred solvents are toluene, ethanol or a mixture of both solvents.<br>
According to the invention the racemization is carried out batchwise i.e. by a reaction in which the reactant is added to a reaction system {e.g. round flask) once and after the reaction the product is separated. In the alternative, according to the invention, the racemization is carried out in a continuous manner i.e. by a continuous running<br><br>
reaction in which the reactant is continuously added to a reaction system (e.g. reactor) and the product is continuously separated.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the racemization is carried out in the melt at a temperature from 260 to 400°"C under normal or elevated pressure at 103 to 3x105 Pa or in a preferred way at a temperature from 280 to 380°C and the same pressure.<br>
In a preferred embodiment a specific amount of the optical active or non-racemic mixture of the intermediate of formula ! is heated in a high or low boiling solvent or in the melt form under argon or under nitrogen. The heating is carried out in a device which allows for heating up to 40Q°C. For small scale the heating can be carried out e.g. with a heating / stirring mantel, an aluminum heating block, an electrically heated reactor or autoclave and the like or by microwave irradiation. For larger scale the heating can be carried out e.g. in reactors or autoclaves. When a low boiling solvent is used the compound of formula I is heated in an autoclave under elevated pressure at 10" to 3.5x10" Pa. The reaction is carried out batchwise or in a continuous manner. After the reaction, a racemic resolution is carried out and then the (R) or (S) form of the bis(phosphine oxide) of formula I is reduced to the (R) or (S) form of bisphosphine hgands of formula II. Or in an alternative, after the racemization, a reduction of the racemic mixture of compound of formula I to ligands of formula II is carried out and then a racemic resolution is carried out to the (R) or (S) form of the bisphosphine ligands of formula II.<br>
The invention is further concerned with the use of the inventive process for the preparation of atropisomeric ligands of the formula II in the pure (R) or (S) form<br><br>
wherein the symbols are defined as above, characterized in that<br><br>
a)	the racemic mixture of bis{phosphine oxides) of formula ! is resolved and<br>
b)	the (R) or (S) form of the bis(phosphine oxide) of formula I is reduced to the (R) or (S) form of the bisphosphine ligand of formula II or<br><br>
a)	the racemic mixture of bis{phosphine oxides) of formula I is reduced to form a racemic mixture of bisphosphine ligands of formula II and<br>
b)	a racemic resolution of the racemic mixture of ligands of formula II is carried out to obtain the (R) or (S) form of the bisphosphine ligand of formula II.<br>
The preparation of compounds of formula I is known and described for example in US 5,274,125.<br>
Both, the racemic resolution and the reduction of compounds of formula I to compounds of formula II are known and described for example in Helvetica Chimica Acta Vol.74(1991)p370etseq.<br>
In a typical reaction, the thermal racemization is carried out with a compound of formula 1 in which R1 signifies methoxy, R2 and R" signify hydrogen, and R4 signifies phenyl ({R) or (S)-MeOBIPHEPO) in a high boiling solvent or in the melt at a temperature from 260 to 400""C under normal or elevated pressure at 105 to 3.5x10" Pa or in a low boiling organic solvent at the same temperature under elevated pressure at 104 to 3.5xl0" Pa.<br>
Compounds of formula I are valuable intermediates in the production of biphosphine ligands of formula II, which are used for the formation of complexes with transition metals, especially with transition metals of Group VHl, such as, for example, ruthenium, rhodium or iridium. These complexes are useful as catalysts in asymmetric reactions such as asymmetric hydrogenations. Complexes of diphosphine ligands with transition metals as well as their use for asymmetric reactions such as asymmetric hydrogenations are known and are described, for example, in US Patent 5,430,191.<br>
