				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.        Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a surgical stapling and cutting instrument<br>
adapted for use in the diagnosis and therapy of pathologies treated by stapled<br>
resection. More particularly, the invention relates to a replaceable cartridge module<br>
utilized in conjunction with a surgical stapling and cutting instrument. The replaceable<br>
cartridge module including both a cartridge housing, for staples and a knife, and an<br>
anvil having a washer.<br>
2.        Description of the Prior Art<br>
Within the field of surgery, the need to surgically seal tissue and to cut tissue is<br>
quite commonplace. Sealing of tissue may be accomplished by numerous sealing<br>
devices, for example, surgical staplers. Cutting of tissue may be accomplished by<br>
numerous cutting devices, for example, scalpels and surgical scissors. Stapling and<br>
cutting of tissue in several steps during the surgical procedure adds time to such<br>
procedures. In order to reduce procedural steps and ultimately the time necessary for<br>
various surgical procedures, instruments have been developed which simultaneously<br>
apply staples and cut desired tissue. As those skilled in the art will certainly appreciate,<br>
it is desirable to provide stapling and cutting instruments capable of performing<br>
multiple stapling and cutting routines during a single procedure.<br>
Some current surgical instruments provide stapling and cutting mechanisms that<br>
operate in the same direction during device actuation, or firing. For instance, staple<br>
formation and tissue cutting occur along the same plane on the tissue. These<br>
instruments generally utilize an anvil, which holds staple pockets (or staple forming<br>
surfaces) and a washer, and a housing assembly, which holds staples and a knife. In<br>
these prior instruments, the anvil is generally a permanent element of the instrument<br>
and the housing assembly is either a permanent element (single-fire device) or a<br>
reloadable element (multiple-fire device). Tissue is captured between the anvil and the<br>
housing assembly of the device. Actuation of the instrument moves the staples from<br>
the housing assembly toward the anvil. The staples puncture the captured tissue and<br>
then contact staple pockets on the anvil, which form the staples into desired shapes to<br>
seal the tissue. In conjunction with the staple formation, actuation of the instrument<br>
also moves the knife from the housing assembly toward the anvil. The knife pushes<br>
the tissue toward the anvil and, upon contact with the knife and the washer on the<br>
anvil, cutting of the tissue is facilitated. The washer functions in a manner similar to<br>
cutting on a cutting board.<br>
The washer is generally made of a resilient material and is a permanent element<br>
of the anvil. The knife is either a permanent element that actuates within the housing<br>
assembly or a reloadable element with the housing assembly. For single-fire<br>
instruments, the washer and knife are discarded with the complete instrument after<br>
firing. Single-fire instruments present higher associated costs since a new instrument<br>
is needed for subsequent firings. For multiple-firing instruments, the housing<br>
assembly is discarded and a new housing assembly is reloaded while the anvil with<br>
accompanying washer is reused for subsequent firings.<br>
Since the washer is generally manufactured out of a plastic material and the<br>
knife is manufactured out of a metallic material, multiple firings into the same washer<br>
often causes degradation of the washer. This may hinder cutting performance and is<br>
consequently undesirable.<br>
As a result, it is desirable to provide a surgical stapling and cutting instrument<br>
adapted for effectively and efficiently permitting multiple cuts with corresponding<br>
staples during a single procedure. The present invention provides such a surgical<br>
stapling and cutting instrument including a replaceable cartridge module having a<br>
cartridge housing and an anvil with a washer secured thereto.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The detailed embodiments of the present invention are disclosed herein. It<br>
should be understood, however, that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary<br>
of the invention, which may be embothed in various forms. Therefore, the details<br>
disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but merely as the basis for<br>
teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention.<br>
With reference to the various figures, the present invention is directed to a<br>
surgical instrument 20 adapted for stapling and cutting tissue in a highly controlled<br>
manner. The instrument 20 generally includes a frame having a proximal end and a<br>
distal end, with a handle 21 positioned at the proximal end and an end effector 80<br>
positioned at the distal end. The end effector 80 includes a U-shaped supporting<br>
structure 81 shaped and dimensioned for selectively receiving a cartridge module 120<br>
containing a plurality of surgical fasteners and a knife. The surgical instrument further<br>
includes a firing mechanism associated with the end effector 80 and the cartridge<br>
module 120 for selective actuation of the surgical fasteners and knife 126. Finally, the<br>
cartridge module 120 includes a cartridge housing 121 in which the surgical fasteners<br>
and knife are housed and an anvil 122 shaped and dimensioned for engagement with<br>
the surgical fasteners and knife to facilitate cutting and stapling. The cartridge housing<br>
121 and anvil 122 are relatively movable between a first spaced apart position and a<br>
second position in close approximation with one another.<br>
Referring to FIGURE 1 in combination with FIGURES 2 to 5, there is shown a<br>
surgical stapling and cutting instrument, in particular, a linear surgical stapler 20 which<br>
is designed to staple and cut tissue. The linear surgical stapler 20 has a handle 21 at a<br>
first proximal end and an end effector 80 at an opposite distal end. The end effector<br>
80 is curved in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Right and left hand structural plates (often called "handle plates") 34, 35, respectively,<br>
connect the handle 21 to the end effector 80 of the instrument (the left hand handle<br>
plate is not shown in FIGURE 1). The handle 21 has a right hand shroud 22 coupled<br>
to a left hand shroud (the left hand shroud is not shown in FIGURE 1). The handle<br>
21 also has a body portion 23 to grip and maneuver the linear surgical stapler 20 (see<br>
FIGURES 2 to 5).<br>
The end effector 80 is a surgical fastening assembly that includes a cartridge<br>
module 120 (sec FIGURES 6 to 9) and a U-shaped supporting structure 81. The distal<br>
end 30 of a closure member 28 is disposed to receive the cartridge module 120. The<br>
end effector 80 also includes a safety lockout mechanism 180 (best seen in FIGURE<br>
31) for preventing the firing of a previously fired cartridge module 120. The cartridge<br>
module 120 contains a cartridge housing 121 coupled to an anvil 122. The cartridge<br>
module 120 also includes a retaining pin 125, a knife 126, a removable retainer 160, a<br>
tissue contacting surface 127 which displays a plurality of staple-containing slots 128 in<br>
staggered formation in one or more rows (that is, staple lines) on either side of the<br>
knife 126. Staples (not shown) are fired from the cartridge housing 121 against staple-<br>
forming surface 129 of the anvil 122 that faces the tissue-contacting surface 127 of the<br>
cartridge housing 121.<br>
As will become apparent based upon the following disclosure, the present linear<br>
surgical stapler 20 is designed as a multiple firing device with a replaceable cartridge<br>
module 120. However, it should be understood that many of the underlying concepts<br>
of the present invention may be equally applied in single firing devices without<br>
departing from the spirit of the present invention.<br>
The supporting structure 81 of the end effector 80 is respectively attached to<br>
the right and left handle plates 34, 35, by a shoulder rivet 82 and posts 83 which<br>
extend from the supporting structure 81 into receiving holes in the handle plates 34,<br>
35. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
supporting structure 81 is formed via a single piece construction. More specifically,<br>
the supporting structure 81 is formed by extrusion, for example, of aluminum, with<br>
subsequent machining to create the supporting structure 81 disclosed in accordance<br>
with the present invention. By constructing the supporting structure 81 in this<br>
manner, multiple parts are not required and the associated cost of manufacture and<br>
assembly is substantially reduced. In addition, it is believed the unitary structure of the<br>
supporting structure 81 enhances the overall stability of the present linear surgical<br>
stapler 20. In addition, the unitary extruded structure of the supporting structure 81<br>
provides for a reduction in weight, easier sterilization since cobalt irradiation will<br>
effectively penetrate the extruded aluminum and less trauma to tissue based upon the<br>
smooth outer surface achieved via extrusion.<br>
The handle 21 of the linear surgical stapler 20 includes a hand grip 24 which the<br>
surgeon grasps with the palm of his hand (see FIGURES 2 to 5). The hand grip 24 is<br>
composed of a right hand shroud handle 25 (see FIGURE 1) and a left hand shroud<br>
handle (the left hand shroud handle is not shown in FIGURE 1). Pivotally extending<br>
from the underside of the handle 21 are a closure trigger 26 and a firing trigger 27.<br>
The linear surgical stapler 20 illustrated in FIGURE 1 is shown with the closure and<br>
firing triggers 26, 27 in their unactuated positions and with a cartridge module 120<br>
inserted and the retainer 160 removed. Consequendy, the cartridge housing 121 is<br>
spaced from the anvil 122 for the placement of tissue between the cartridge housing<br>
121 and the anvil 122.<br>
The handle 21 of the linear surgical stapler 20 contains a tissue retaining pin<br>
actuation mechanism 100. The tissue retaining pin actuation mechanism 100 includes<br>
a saddle shaped slide 101 positioned on the top surface of the handle 21. Manual<br>
movement of the slide 101 results in distal movement of the push rod 102. The push<br>
rod 102 is coupled to the retaining pin 125 of the cartridge module 120. The distal<br>
movement or proximal retraction of the push rod 102 results in corresponding<br>
movement of the retaining pin 125.   The retaining pin actuation mechanism 100 is<br>
also releasably coupled to the closure trigger 26 within the handle 21 such that<br>
actuation of the closure trigger 26 will result in automatic distal movement of the<br>
retaining pin 125 if it has not already been manually moved to its most proximal<br>
position.<br>
Referring briefly to FIGURES 2 to 5, there is illustrated what happens when the<br>
cartridge module 120 is loaded and the closure and firing triggers 26, 27 are<br>
sequentially squeezed toward the hand grip 24 to actuate the end effector 80 of the<br>
linear surgical stapler 20. The linear surgical stapler 20 is loaded with the cartridge<br>
module 120, as shown in FIGURE 2, and the retainer 160 is removed. The linear<br>
surgical stapler 20 is now ready to receive tissue as shown in FIGURE 1.<br>
When the closure trigger 26 is partially squeezed to rest in its first detent<br>
position shown in FIGURE 3, the cartridge housing 121 moves from its fully opened<br>
position to an intermediate position between the open and closed positions as<br>
discussed below in greater detail. Simultaneously, the tissue retaining pin actuation<br>
mechanism 100 moves the retaining pin 125 forward from the cartridge housing 121<br>
through an opening in the anvil 122.   In this position, tissue which has been placed<br>
between the cartridge housing 121 and the anvil 122 can be properly positioned, and<br>
the retention of the tissue between the cartridge housing 121 and the anvil 122 is<br>
assured. Therefore, when the closure trigger 26 has been actuated to its intermediate<br>
position, the cartridge housing 121 and anvil 122 are correspondingly positioned in<br>
their tissue retaining positions.<br>
When the closure trigger 26 is fully squeezed so that it is adjacent the forward<br>
end of the hand grip 24, as illustrated in FIGURE 4, the tissue contacting surface 127<br>
of the cartridge housing 121 and the staple-forming surface 129 of the anvil 122 are<br>
adjacent to each other, and the properly positioned and retained tissue is consequendy<br>
fully clamped. Additionally, the firing trigger 27 has rotated counterclockwise toward<br>
the handgrip 24 to enable the surgeon to grasp the firing trigger 27 for the firing of<br>
staples. Accordingly, the firing trigger 27 is now in position for the surgeon to squeeze<br>
it to staple and cut the tissue. When the firing trigger 27 has been fully squeezed to<br>
fire the staples, as shown in FIGURE 5, the firing trigger 27 rests in near proximity to<br>
the closure trigger 26.<br>
Referring now to FIGURES 6 to 9, a more detailed description of the cartridge<br>
module 120 is presented.   The present cartridge module 120 provides a cutting and<br>
sealing mechanism for utilization within the linear surgical stapler 20 wherein the<br>
stapling and cutting functions operate in the same direction during device actuation.<br>
Although the present cartridge module 120 is particularly adapted for use in<br>
conjunction with linear surgical stapling devices, the concepts of the present cartridge<br>
module 120 may be applied to other surgical devices without departing from the spirit<br>
of the present invention. In particular, the present cartridge module 120 provides that<br>
the knife 126 be utilized in conjunction with a corresponding washer 123 during the<br>
cutting process. The present cartridge module 120 ensures that multiple firings of the<br>
linear surgical stapler 20 will not compromising cutting performance. This is<br>
accomplished by incorporating the anvil 122, in particular, the cutting washing 123,<br>
with the cartridge module 120. By combining the washer 123 with the cartridge<br>
module 120, a new washer 123 is provided each time the cartridge module 120 is<br>
replaced, resulting in improved cutting performance.<br>
Enhanced performance is further provided by positioning the anvil 122 and the<br>
cartridge housing 121 parallel such that they move relative to each other with the<br>
facing surfaces of the anvil 122 and the cartridge housing 121 maintained in a parallel<br>
orientation. This provides for an even distribution of pressure across the tissue,<br>
preventing squeezing of the tissue in a manner which might bunch the tissue and force<br>
portions of the tissue out of the desired spaced defined between the anvil 122 and the<br>
cartridge housing 121.<br>
More specifically, the cartridge module 120 includes a cartridge housing 121<br>
that contains a plurality of staples (not shown) positioned in staple-containing slots<br>
128. Immediately behind the staples is disposed a driver 131 which is disposed to<br>
push the staples out of the staple slots 128. A knife holder 130 is disposed<br>
immediately proximal of the driver 131 in the cartridge housing 121. The knife holder<br>
130 contains a slot 172 and ledge 173 for interaction with a knife retractor hook 45<br>
(see FIG. 37) the function of which will be discussed below in greater.   The knife<br>
holder 130 is attached to a knife 126 that extends distally from the knife holder 130<br>
through a slot 200 in the driver 131 and through a slot 199 in the cartridge housing<br>
121.<br>
The knife holder 130 has a detent post 138 that extends through a slot 137 in<br>
the cartridge housing 121. The knife holder detent post 138 is disposed to contact<br>
detent protrusion 139 of the cartridge slot 137 during the longitudinal travel of the<br>
knife 126 and the knife holder 130. Similarly, the driver 131 has a detent post 140 that<br>
is disposed to contact proximal and distal detent protrusions 141, 142, respectively, of<br>
the cartridge slot 137.<br>
The knife 126 and slots 199, 200 are positioned such that there is at least one<br>
row of staples on either side of the knife 126. In accordance with a preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention, two rows of staple slots 128 (and two rows of<br>
staples) ate provided on each side of the slot 199 of the cartridge housing 121.<br>
The cartridge housing 121 contains two generally circular openings 143,144 at<br>
either end of the knife slot 199. The general circular opening 143 at the base of the<br>
cartridge housing 121 is shaped and dimensioned for the passage of a guide pin 124<br>
through the cartridge housing 121. The generally circular hole 144 at the top of the<br>
cartridge housing 121 is shaped and dimensioned for the passage of a retaining pin 125<br>
dirough the cartridge housing 121.   The staple slots 128 are arranged such that the<br>
staples laterally extend past the generally circular holes 143, 144.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the anvil<br>
122 includes a plastic washer 123 and a metallic staple-forming surface 129. The anvil<br>
122 is disposed to maintain staple-forming surface 129 in a matching configuration.<br>
The retaining pin 125 is connected to a coupler 133 by a circumferential slot 135 in the<br>
retaining pin 125 and a groove 134 in the coupler 133 (best seen in FIGURE 14).<br>
The coupler 133 is disposed within an arm 145 of the cartridge housing 121 and is held<br>
into the arm 145 by an end cap 146.<br>
The guide pin 124 and retaining pin 125 include respective slots 147a, 147b<br>
(best seen in FIGURES 8, 9, 36, 39 and 40) into which the ends 126a, 126b of the<br>
knife 126 are disposed. The guide pin 124 proximal end 148 is connected to the<br>
proximal end 149 of the anvil 122. The distal end 150 of the guide pin 124 extends<br>
from the cartridge housing 121 and extends through a slot 151 of the anvil 122. A<br>
cutting washer 123 slips onto the anvil 122 by means of a groove 152 on the anvil 122<br>
that fits under a tongue 153 on the washer 123. The opposite end 154 of the cutting<br>
washer 123 slips under the anvil arm 155 and is pinned to the anvil arm 155 by a pin<br>
156.   In this position, the cutting surface 157 of the washer 123 extends up through a<br>
slot 151 of the anvil 122. The assembly of the cutting washer 123 to the anvil 122<br>
traps the guide pin 124 into the opening formed by the anvil slot 151 and the cutting<br>
surface 157, thereby, operatively connecting the anvil 122 to the cartridge housing 121.<br>
The retainer 160 is attached to the cartridge module 120 as shown in FIGURE 7 to<br>
hold the components of the cartridge module 120 in a desired orientation until<br>
insertion into the end effector 80.<br>
As briefly discussed above, and in accordance with a preferred embodiment of<br>
the present invention, the cartridge module 120 includes an anvil 122, or plate, having<br>
staple-forming surface 129 and a washer 123. The anvil 122 is supported by the distal<br>
end of the supporting structure 81 of the linear surgical stapler 20. That is, the anvil<br>
122 of the present cartridge module 120 has its rearward surface supported by and the<br>
distal end of the supporting structure 81 formed as an integral part of the linear<br>
surgical stapler's supporting structure 81.   More specifically, the washer 123 is in<br>
direct contact with the supporting structure 81 (see FIGURES 6, 7 and 22). As forces<br>
ate applied to the anvil 122, the washer 123 presses against the supporting structure<br>
81.<br>
The cartridge module 120 in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention includes a cartridge housing 121 in which the staples and knife 126<br>
are housed for movement. The anvil 122 is direcdy linked to the cartridge housing 121<br>
and forms an integral part of the cartridge module 120 as discussed above. In this<br>
way, the anvil 122 and the cartridge housing 121 form a complete cartridge module<br>
120 which may be replaced as needed when a multiple-firing surgical stapling device is<br>
needed.<br>
Coupling members (discussed below in greater detail) extending from the<br>
cartridge module 120 couple the present cartridge module 120 to the end effector 80<br>
of the supporting structure 81 of the linear surgical stapler 20. In this way, the<br>
cartridge module 120 is seated within the linear surgical stapler 20 with the anvil 122<br>
sitting direcdy in front of the anvil support 82 of the supporting structure 81 of the<br>
linear surgical stapler 20.<br>
Movement of the cartridge housing 121 distally along the long axis of the linear<br>
surgical stapler 20 toward the anvil 122 is facilitated by the sliding engagement<br>
between the cartridge housing 121 and the anvil arm 155 which facilitates movement<br>
of the cartridge housing 121 relative to the anvil 122. A retainer 160 is provided<br>
between the anvil 122 and the cartridge housing 121. The retainer 160 prevents<br>
undesired movement of the cartridge housing structure toward the anvil 122. The<br>
retainer 160 is selectively removable when the device is ready for use.<br>
With reference to FIGURE 41, an alternate embodiment of the integral housing<br>
structure/anvil cartridge module 120' is disclosed. As with the prior embodiment, the<br>
cartridge module 120' provides a cutting and sealing mechanism for utilization within a<br>
linear surgical stapler 20 wherein the stapling and cutting functions operate in the same<br>
direction during device actuation. The cartridge module 120' includes an anvil 122'<br>
having staple forming surfaces 129' and a washer 123'.<br>
As with the prior embodiment, the anvil 122' is supported by distal end of the<br>
support structure of the linear surgical stapler. That is, the anvil 122' of the present<br>
cartridge module 120' has its rearward surface supported by the supporting structure<br>
formed as an integral part of the linear surgical stapler's supporting structure.<br>
The anvil 122' is direcdy linked to the cartridge housing 121' structure and<br>
forms and integral part of the cartridge module 120'. An anvil arm 155' attaches the<br>
anvil 122' to the cartridge housing 121' of the cartridge module 120'. In this way, the<br>
anvil 122' and the cartridge housing 121' form a complete cartridge module 120' which<br>
may be replaced as needed within the multiple-firing linear surgical stapler.<br>
Attachment pins 119' extending from opposite ends of the cartridge module<br>
120' couple me present cartridge module 120' to the supporting structure of the linear<br>
surgical stapler. In this way, the cartridge module 120' is seated within the linear<br>
surgical stapler with the anvil 122' sitting directly in front of the anvil support of the<br>
supporting structure of the linear surgical stapler.<br>
Movement of the cartridge housing 121' distally along the linear surgical stapler<br>
toward the anvil 122' is facilitated by the provision a track 118' in which the cartridge<br>
housing 121' rides as it is moved toward the anvil 122'.<br>
A further embodiment is disclosed with reference to FIGURES 42 and 43.<br>
This embodiment includes an anvil 122' having only a washer 123" (the remaining<br>
portions of the anvil are formed as part of the supporting structure 81 "of the end<br>
effector 80"). As such, the washer 123" slides within a slot 136" formed in the<br>
supporting structure 81" to secure the cartridge module 120" to the end effector 80".<br>
The anvil 122" is directly linked to the cartridge housing 121" structure and<br>
forms and integral part of the cartridge module 120". An anvil arm 155" attaches the<br>
anvil 122" to the cartridge housing 121" of the cartridge module 120". Attachment<br>
pins 119" extending from opposite ends of the cartridge module 120" couple the<br>
present cartridge module 120" to the supporting structure 81" of the linear surgical<br>
stapler. Movement of the cartridge housing 121" distally along the linear surgical<br>
stapler toward the anvil 122" is facilitated by the provision a track 118" in which the<br>
cartridge housing 121" rides as it is moved toward the anvil 122".<br>
Regardless of which embodiment is employed, the replaceable parts making up<br>
the anvil and cartridge housing are package together as a complete replacement head,<br>
or cartridge module. Each replacement head incorporates a support bridge that holds<br>
the cartridge housing to the washer such that the washer is integrally formed with the<br>
cutting elements. Each replacement head includes a retainer that supports the parts<br>
during shipping and also protects the staples from being dislodged. The head is easily<br>
attachable and detachable from the primary support structure of the linear surgical<br>
stapler.<br>
Ultimately, the present cartridge module incorporating and anvil with staple<br>
forming surfaces and a washer is advantageous over prior devices in that it provides a<br>
cutting mechanism permitting multiple firings without compromising cutting<br>
performance. This is achieved by providing a new anvil with a new washer and anvil<br>
pockets for each firing. In addition, the present cartridge module is lower costs than<br>
single-fire devices since only the replacement head with the anvil needs to be replaced<br>
upon utilization of the device.<br>
Turning to FIGURES 6 to 12 in combination with FIGURES 25 to 29, the<br>
retainer 160 will be described in more detail.   The retainer 160 has a groove 161 that is<br>
disposed around a protrusion 159 of the cartridge housing 121. The retainer 160<br>
contains a resilient inner spring arm 162 that is disposed for reciprocating movement<br>
within the retainer 160. The retainer 160 includes containment slots 163 which extend<br>
partially around the guide pin 124.   The spring arm 162 includes containment slots<br>
164 which extend partially around the guide pin 124, but are configured to face in an<br>
opposing direction to the containment slots 163.   The retainer 160 is positioned onto<br>
the cartridge module 120 such that the containment slots 163,164 surround the guide<br>
pin 124 and trap the retainer 160 onto the cartridge module 120.   The spring arm 162<br>
includes a disengagement tab 165 which extends down from the retainer 160 below the<br>
anvil arm 155. As such, the retainer 160 is not easily removed from the cartridge<br>
module 120 until the cartridge module 120 is properly seated within the end effector<br>
80. Upon proper seating of the cartridge module 120 within the end effector 80, the<br>
disengagement tab 165 engages the end effector 80 for release of the retainer 160.<br>
Referring once again to FIGURE 1 in combination with FIGURE 2 and<br>
FIGURE 13, a more detailed description of the components of the linear surgical<br>
stapler 20 is provided.   The linear surgical stapler 20 includes an elongated closure<br>
member 28, with a generally U shaped cross section, extending from the handle 21<br>
into the surgical fastening assembly of the end effector 80. In accordance with a<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention, the closure member 28 is a molded<br>
plastic member shaped for movement and functionality in accordance with the present<br>
invention. By manufacturing the closure member 28 from plastic, manufacturing costs<br>
are reduced and the weight of the linear surgical stapler 20 is also reduced. In<br>
addition, the linear surgical stapler 20 is easier to sterilize with cobalt irradiation as<br>
plastic is easier to penetrate than stainless steel. In accordance with an alternate<br>
embodiment, the closure member may be made from extruded aluminum with the<br>
final features machined into place. While an extruded aluminum closure member<br>
might not be as easy to manufacture as the plastic component, it would still have the<br>
same advantages (i.e., elimination of components, easier to assemble, lower weight,<br>
easier to sterilize).<br>
The distal portion of the closure member 28 passes through the walls 84 of the<br>
supporting structure 81. The distal end is disposed to receive and retain the cartridge<br>
housing 121 of the cartridge module 120.   The central portion of the closure member<br>
28 is positioned between the right and left handle plates 34, 35, respectively. Right and<br>
left hand closure links 36, 37, respectively, are pivotally attached at the right and left<br>
proximal ends of the closure member 28 by a first integral closure link pin 38. At the<br>
opposite end of the closure links 36, 37, the closure links 36, 37 are pivotally attached<br>
to a second integral closure link pin 39. The second integral closure link pin 39<br>
connects the closure links 36, 37 to a slotted closure arm link 40. The slotted closure<br>
arm link 40 is pivotally mounted to the handle plates 34, 35 of the linear surgical<br>
stapler 20 at a closure trigger pivot pin 41. The closure trigger 26 descends from the<br>
slotted closure arm link 40 for pivotal rotation about the closure trigger pivot pin 41<br>
toward and away from the handgrip 24. A closure spring 42 housed within the hand<br>
grip 24 of the handle 21 is secured to the slotted closure arm link 40 to provide a<br>
desired resistance when the surgeon squeezes the closure trigger 26 toward the handle<br>
grip 24, and to bias the closure trigger 26 toward the open position.<br>
Referring to FIGURES 13'and 14, the components of the retaining pin<br>
actuation mechanism 100 will now be described. The handle 21 contains a saddle<br>
shaped slide 101 mounted on top of the handle 21 for linear motion. The slide 101 is<br>
connected to a post 103 that extends outward from a push rod driver 104 through<br>
slots 105 (see FIGURE 2) in the handle 21. The push rod driver 104 is restrained for<br>
longitudinal movement along the long axis of the linear surgical stapler 20 by slots 105.<br>
The push rod driver 104 is connected to the push rod 102 by a circumferential groove<br>
107 on the push rod 102 that snaps into a slot 108 of the push rod driver 104. The<br>
distal end of the push rod 102 contains a circumferential groove 109 that interconnects<br>
with a groove 132 in the proximal end of the coupler 133 of the cartridge module 120<br>
(best seen in FIGURE 22).   The distal end of the coupler 133 contains a groove 134<br>
for interconnecting with a circumferential slot 135 on the retaining pin 125.<br>
The closure member 28 contains posts 29 which extend laterally on both sides<br>
of the closure member 28 inside the handle 21. These posts 29 slidably connect to an<br>
L-shaped slot 110 of a yoke 111.   The yoke 111 is pivotally mounted to the handle 21<br>
by a pivot pin 112 on the yoke 111.   The yoke 111 contains cam pins 113 positioned<br>
to push camming surfaces 114 on the push rod driver 104.<br>
Referring to FIGURE 13 and FIGURE 37, the components of the firing<br>
transmission assembly will now be described. The firing transmission assembly has an<br>
elongated firing bar 43 extending from the handle 21 into the surgical fastening<br>
assembly of the end effector 80. The firing bar 43 is positioned within the U shaped<br>
cross section of the closure member 28. The distal end of the firing bar 43 extends<br>
into the cartridge housing 121 and is positioned just proximally of the knife holder 130<br>
and driver 131. The distal end of the firing bar 43 is attached to a knife retractor 44<br>
that has a knife retraction hook 45.<br>
The firing bar 43 has a rectangular receiving slot 46 in that portion of the firing<br>
bar 43 that is housed within the handle 21 (see FIGURE 13). The first integral closure<br>
link pin 38 extends through the receiving slot 46. The firing bar 43 also has a proximal<br>
end section 47. The underside of the proximal end section 47 of the firing bar 43 has<br>
a sliding surface 48. The proximal end section 47 also has a terminal side engagement<br>
surface 49 extending from the sliding surface 48. The firing trigger 27 is pivotally<br>
mounted to the handle plates 34, 35 by a firing trigger pivot pin 50 spaced from the<br>
closure trigger pivot pin 41 so that each of the pivot pins pivot about mutually<br>
independent axes. The firing trigger 27 includes an arcuate firing trigger link 51<br>
extending from the firing trigger 27 at the firing trigger pivot pin 50 to an apex 52<br>
which rests on the sliding surface 48 of the proximal end section 47 of the firing bar<br>
43. Within the handle 21, the firing trigger 27 is attached to first and second firing<br>
trigger spring arms 53, 54, respectively. The firing trigger spring arms 53, 54 support a<br>
torsion spring (not shown) on the right half of the firing trigger 43. Finally, a firing<br>
bar return spring 55 is secured to the underside of the firing bar 43 at that portion of<br>
the firing bar 43 within the handle 21 to bias the firing bar 43 toward its unactuated<br>
position.<br>
When the closure trigger 26 is squeezed toward the handgrip 24, the slotted<br>
closure arm link 40 and the closure links 36, move distally within the receiving slot 46<br>
of the firing bar 43. This distal movement causes the closure member 28 to<br>
correspondingly move distally. Likewise, the firing bar 43 concurrendy moves distally<br>
with the closure member 28 because the first integral closure link pin 38, to which the<br>
closure links 36, 37 are attached, extends through the receiving slot 46 in the firing bar<br>
13.<br>
The mechanism which defines an intermediate closure detent position and the<br>
release of the closure trigger 26 from an actuated position to its original unactsuated<br>
position will now be described in connection with FIGURE 1 in combination with<br>
FIGURES 13-20. The top side of the slotted closure arm link 40 has a clamp sliding<br>
surface 56 that displays an intermediate detent 57 and a closure detent 58. A release<br>
pall 59 slides on the clamp sliding surface 56 and may engage the intermediate and<br>
closure detents 57, 58. The release pall 59 has a laterally extending pall lug 60 (best<br>
seen in FIGURE 1) at its distal end. The release pall 59 is located within the handle 21,<br>
and it is integrally attached to a release button 61 situated exteriorly of the handle 21.<br>
The release button 61 has a diumb rest 62, and the release button 61 is pivotally<br>
attached to the handle 21 by a release trunnion 63. The release button 61 is biased<br>
outwardly from the handle 21 and, therefore, the release pall 59 is biased downwardly<br>
toward the clamp sliding surface 56 by a release spring 64 which is mounted to the<br>
handle 21 by a spring retention pin 65 and mounted to the release button 61 by a<br>
button spring post 66.   The slotted closure arm link 40 has an arcuate recess 67 located<br>
between the intermediate and closure detents 57, 58. Sitting within this arcuate recess<br>
67 for rotational movement are a left hand toggle 68 integrally connected to a right<br>
hand toggle (the right hand toggle is not shown). Each toggle 68 has a toggle arm 69<br>
that is engageable with the pall lug 60. The pall lug 60 has a concave proximal surface<br>
70 to provide clearance between the toggle arm 69 and the pall lug 60.<br>
Reletting to FIGURE 31 (cut away view into cartridge and supporting<br>
structure), the components of the fired device lockout mechanism 180 will now be<br>
described.   The lockout mechanism 180 contains a lockout lever 181 that is pivotally<br>
mounted to the distal end 30 of the closure member 28 by a pin 182. The lockout<br>
lever 181 is spring biased down toward the base of supporting structure 81 by a spring<br>
(not shown).   The lockout lever 181 contains a proximal and distal end 184,185, .<br>
respectively. The proximal end 184 has a cam surface 186 and locking groove 187.<br>
The supporting structure 81 of the end effector 80 contains a ledge 85 that is disposed<br>
to interact with locking groove 187 when the lockout mechanism 180 is engaged.   The<br>
supporting structure 81 contains a base surface 86 between walls 84.   The base surface<br>
86 is disposed to interact with cam surface 186 when the lockout lever 181 is not<br>
engaged.<br>
The operation of loading the cartridge module 120, the closure mechanism, the<br>
retaining pin mechanism, the firing transmission assembly, the intermediate and<br>
closure detents 57, 58, the release mechanism, and the lockout mechanism 180 will<br>
now be described.    Referring to FIGURES 7 to 12 and FIGURES 21 to 28 the<br>
loading of the cartridge module 120 into the tissue end effector 80 is described.    The<br>
cartridge module 120 is shaped and dimensioned for selective insertion and removal<br>
from the tissue end effector 80 of the linear surgical stapler 20.<br>
Prior to insertion of the cartridge module 120 into the end effector 80 of the<br>
linear surgical stapler 20, as seen in FIGURE 7, the retainer 160 can not easily be<br>
removed from the cartridge module 120 as the groove 161 is disposed around the<br>
protrusion 159 at the top end of the retainer 160 preventing disconnection. Further,<br>
the containment slots 163,164 of the retainer are disposed around the guide pin 124 at<br>
the bottom of the retainer 160 preventing disconnection as shown in FIGURE 25..<br>
The attached retainer 160 provides support to the structure of the cartridge<br>
module 120 and an extended surface area for gripping, both features making loading<br>
easier. The retainer 160 also prevents staples from dislodging from the cartridge<br>
housing 121 during casual handling and prevents the knife 126 from accidental<br>
exposure during casual handling.<br>
Knife 126 movement and staple movement are further resisted prior to loading<br>
and during loading by a series of detents. Referring to FIGURE 9, detent post 138 on<br>
the knife holder 130 is prevented from proximal and distal movement by the detent<br>
protrusion 139 on the cartridge housing slot 137. The driver 131 is prevented from<br>
distal movement due to casual handling and during loading of the cartridge module<br>
120 into the linear surgical stapler 20 by the interaction of the detent post 140 and the<br>
detent protrusion 141 on the cartridge housing slot 137.<br>
The cartridge module 120 is loaded into the tissue effector 80 such that the<br>
cartridge housing 121 slips into the distal end 30 of the closure member 28 as seen in<br>
FIGURES 21 to 24. Walls 31a and 31b on the closure member 28 slip into slots 170a,<br>
170b of the cartridge housing 121 during loading. Simultaneously, tabs 174 (See<br>
FIGURE 8) slip into groove 88 of the U-shaped supporting structure 81. In<br>
particular, the tabs are U-shaped and fit over the grooves 88 along the supporting<br>
structure to securely and accurately couple the cartridge module 120 to the end<br>
effector 80. Loading of the cartridge module 120 is completed when the detents 171<br>
snap onto the detent groove 32 of the closure member distal end 30, as shown in<br>
FIGURES 21 to 24.<br>
In the position shown in FIGURE 24, the cartridge module 120 is fully loaded<br>
and the proximal groove 132 of the coupler 133 has engaged the distal circumferential<br>
groove 109 of the push rod 102 such that the retaining pin 125 in the cartridge module<br>
120 has been connected to the retaining pin advancement mechanism 100. The slot<br>
172 of knife holder 131 engages the knife retraction hook 45 during loading such that<br>
the hook 45 has engaged the retraction ledge 173 on the knife holder 130 at the<br>
completion of the cartridge module 120 loading.<br>
At the completion of the cartridge module 120 loading a post 188 positioned on<br>
driver 131 contacts the distal end 185 of the lockout lever 181 (see FIGURE 31). This<br>
contact pivots the lockout lever 181 about the lockout lever pin 182 to a position such<br>
that the camming surface 186 is horizontally aligned with the base surface 86 of the U<br>
shaped supporting structure 81.<br>
The retainer 160 can now be removed from the end effector 80. Specifically,<br>
completion of loading the cartridge module 120 causes the disengagement tab 165 to<br>
contact the supporting structure 81 (See FIGURE 23), resulting in an upward<br>
movement of the spring arm 162 when the cartridge module 120 is fully loaded as in<br>
FIGURE 24. This upward movement displaces containment slots 164 upward such<br>
that the guide pin 124 is no longer contained (see FIGURES 25 and 26). Referring<br>
now to FIGS 27 to 29, a removal force applied to the thumb pad 166 results in the<br>
retainer 160 pivoting outward about protrusion 159 until the groove 161 is able to slip<br>
off protrusion 159. Removal of the retainer 160 allows for the loaded linear surgical<br>
stapler 20 to be utilized.<br>
In FIGURE 15, the closure trigger 26 has been partially squeezed from its open,<br>
unactuated position illustrated in FIGURES 1 and 13. When the closure trigger 26 is<br>
partially squeezed, it pivots about the closure trigger pivot pin 41 in a<br>
counterclockwise direction toward the handgrip 24. As it pivots, the slotted closure<br>
arm link 40 and closure plate closure links 36, 37 move forwardly, consequently<br>
moving the closure member 28 and firing bar 43 distally. As the slotted closure arm<br>
link 40 moves forwardly, the pall lug 60 of the release pall 59 slides on the clamp<br>
sliding surface 56. The pall lug 60 engages the distal ends of the toggle arms 69 of the<br>
toggles 68, and consequently pivots the toggles 68 in a clockwise direction. As the<br>
slotted arm closure link 40 continues to move forwardly in response to the pivotal<br>
movement of the closure trigger 26 toward the handgrip 24, the pall lug 60 of the<br>
release pall 59 will eventually lodge into the intermediate detent 57. Once positioned<br>
in the intermediate detent 57, the closure spring 42 is incapable of returning the<br>
closure trigger 26 to its original, unactuated position. The closure trigger 26 is now in<br>
its intermediate, partially closed position, to properly position and retain tissue<br>
between the cartridge housing 121 and anvil 122, as shown in FIGURE 15. In<br>
addition, as the closure member 28 and firing bar 43 move distally, the apex 52 of the<br>
arcuate firing trigger link 51 slides on the sliding surface 48 of the proximal end<br>
section 47 of the firing bar 43.<br>
During the closing stroke from the open to the intermediate position the<br>
retaining pin mechanism 100 is activated. Forward movement of the closure member<br>
28 moves the integral posts 29 distally. The posts 29 contact the L-shaped slot 110 of<br>
the yoke 111. Hence, distal movement of the posts 29 cam the L-shaped slot 110<br>
causing the yoke to pivot around pins 112.   The rotation brings beating posts 113 on<br>
the yoke 111 into contact with camming surfaces 114 on the push rod driver 104.<br>
Further rotational movement of the yoke 111 causes bearing posts 113 to move the<br>
push rod driver 104 distally through camming contact on surfaces 114. The push rod<br>
driver 104 contacts the push rod 102, moving the push rod 102 distally.   The push rod<br>
102, in turn, moves the coupler 133 and retaining pin 125 distally. Completion of the<br>
closing stroke to the intermediate detent 57 position results in the retaining pin 125<br>
moving distally through the hole 144 of the cartridge housing 121, the slot of the anvil<br>
151, the hole in the washer 170 and into the hole 89 (not shown) in the supporting<br>
structure 81. Tissue, which was disposed between the contact surface 127 of the<br>
cartridge housing 121 and the anvil 122, is now trapped between retaining pin 125 and<br>
the guide pin 124.<br>
This same result can be obtained prior to closing by manual distal movement of<br>
saddle slide 101. Slide movement will result in forward movement of the push rod<br>
102, coupler 133 and retaining pin 125 until the retaining pin 125 is fully disposed<br>
dirough the anvil 122, washer 123 and hole 89 in the supporting structure 81.<br>
Activation of the closing stroke after the retaining pin 125 has been manually moved<br>
forward would still result in the rotation of the yoke 111 as described above but<br>
without any additional movement of the retaining pin actuation mechanism 100.<br>
The closing stroke from the open to the intermediate detent 57 position moves<br>
the lockout lever 181 distally as it is attached to closure member 28 by the pin 182 as<br>
shown in FIGURE 31 (open) and FIGURE 32 (intermediate position). Distal<br>
movement of the lockout lever 181 causes the camming surface 186 to contact the<br>
lockout ledge 85 of the support 81, resulting in the lockout lever 181 rotating<br>
clockwise and coming to slidable contact with base surface 86 of supporting structure<br>
81.   In this position, the distal end 185 of the lockout lever 181 has rotated away from<br>
post 188 on driver 131.<br>
Referring now specifically to FIGURE 16, when the closure trigger 26 is<br>
squeezed toward the handgrip 24 from the intermediate detent 57 position, the toggle<br>
arms 69 of the toggle 68 disengage from the pall lug 60. Consequendy, as the toggle<br>
68 continues to rotate in a clockwise direction, the release pall lug 60 rides up the<br>
toggle arms 69 and with continued motion of the closure trigger 26 falls into the<br>
closure detent 58. As the release pall 59 rides up the toggle arm 69 it rotates the<br>
release button 61 clockwise around pivot 63. As the release pall 60 falls into closure<br>
detent 58, it makes an audible clicking sound alerting the surgeon that closure position<br>
has been reached.<br>
In addition, as the firing bar 43 continues to move forwardly, the apex 52 of the<br>
arcuate firing trigger link 51 comes into contact with the side engagement surface 49 of<br>
the proximal end section 47 of the firing bat 43. Consequently, the firing trigger 27 is<br>
moving into a position where it can continue to move the firing bar 43 distally to fire<br>
staples after the tissue has been fully clamped. When the apex 52 of the arcuate firing<br>
trigger link 51 moves into engagement with the engagement surface 49 of the proximal<br>
end section 47, the firing trigger 27 begins to pivotally rotate in a counterclockwise<br>
direction toward the hand grip 24 in response to the action of a torsion spring on the<br>
right hand side of the trigger 27 (torsion spring not shown). The firing trigger 27<br>
pivots independently of the pivotal movement of the closure trigger 26, but its pivotal<br>
rotation is blocked until the firing bar 43 has moved distally to enable engagement of<br>
the firing trigger link 51 with the terminal engagement surface of the firing bar 43.<br>
Turning specifically to FIGURE 17, when the closure trigger 47 has been fully<br>
squeezed and it is adjacent the handgrip 24, the pall lug 60 at the distal end of the<br>
release pall lodge 59 into the closure detent 58. In the closure detent 58 position, the<br>
tissue has been fully clamped between the cartridge housing 121 and anvil 122, and the<br>
closure spring 42 is incapable of returning the closure trigger 26 to its original position.<br>
Therefore, the closure trigger 26 is retained in the position shown in FIGURE 4.<br>
Concurrently with the counterclockwise motion of the closure trigger 26, the<br>
firing trigger 27 continues to rotate counterclockwise by the action of the torsion firing<br>
bar return spring 55 until the firing trigger 27 is in a relatively vertical orientation with<br>
respect to the handle 21 of the linear surgical stapler 20. In the fully clamped position,<br>
the apex 52 of the arcuate firing trigger link 51 has fully engaged the engagement<br>
surface of the proximal end section 47 of the firing bar 43 and, therefore, the firing<br>
trigger 27 is in a position to further move the firing bar 43 distally to fire staples into<br>
the tissue.<br>
In the fully closed position the staple pockets 128 of the cartridge housing 121<br>
are aligned with the staple-forming surface 129 of the anvil 122 as shown in FIGURE<br>
33. The retaining pin 125 has aligned the top of the anvil 122 and the cartridge<br>
housing 121 and the guide pin 124 has aligned the bottom of the cartridge housing 121<br>
with the bottom of the anvil 122.<br>
As illustrated in FIGURE 18 and FIGURE 34, the firing trigger 27 can be<br>
squeezed to pivotally rotate it toward the hand grip 24 until it is positioned adjacent<br>
the closure trigger 26.  During the pivotal rotation of the firing trigger 27, the firing<br>
bar 43 moves distally, contacts the knife holder 130. The resulting distal movement of<br>
the knife holder 130 results in contact with the knife 126 and driver 131. Distal<br>
movement of the driver 131 results in the staples (not shown) to be distally advanced<br>
into the staple forming surfaces 129 of the anvil 122 resulting in staple formation of a<br>
generally B shape. The knife 126 distally advances in slots 147 of the guide pin 124<br>
and the retaining pin 125 in conjunction with staple formation. These slots 147 guide<br>
the knife 126 onto the cutting surface 157 of cutting washer 123 resulting in the<br>
transection of any tissue caught between.<br>
Release of manual pressure to the firing trigger 27 results in the firing bar return<br>
spring 55 to retract the firing bar 43 and returns the firing trigger 27 to the position<br>
shown in FIGURE 17. This movement results in the retraction hook 45 to retract on<br>
the retraction ledge 173 on the knife holder 130 and knife 126. The resulting proximal<br>
movement retracts the knife 126 into the cartridge housing 121 as shown in FIGURE<br>
35. Detent post 138 on the knife holder 130 retracts into engagement with the detent<br>
139 on the cartridge housing 121 to hold the knife holder 130 and knife 126 in this<br>
retracted position. The driver 131 is retained in its distal most (fired) position by<br>
engagement of the detent post 140 on the driver 131 engaging detent 142 of the<br>
cartridge slot 137.<br>
Should there be an interference on the knife 126, as from the user cutting into<br>
another surgical instrument by mistake, such that the force from the firing bar return<br>
spring 55 is insufficient to retract the firing bar 43 and thus retract the knife 126 into  .<br>
the cartridge housing 121, the user can manually retract the cutting system by pulling<br>
clockwise on the firing trigger 27. The manual clockwise movement causes the arcuate<br>
firing trigger link 51 to rotate clockwise until it strikes a firing bar retraction tab 71 on<br>
the proximal end 47 of the firing bar 43.   The contact between the clockwise moving<br>
arcuate firing trigger link 51 and the firing bar retraction tab 71 cause the firing bar 43<br>
to retract proximally and return to the position shown in FIGURE 17. This in turn<br>
causes the retraction hook 45 to retract on the retraction ledge 173 on the knife holder<br>
130 and knife 126. Thus, this safety feature allows for the user to retract the cutting<br>
mechanism to a safe position and return the firing system to a position that would<br>
allow the linear surgical stapler 20 to be opened as will now be described.<br>
Referring to FIGURE 19, when the surgeon depresses the release button 61,<br>
the release pall 59 pivots about the release trunnion 63 in a clockwise direction to<br>
dislodge the pall lug 60 from the closure detent 58 position. As it is dislodged, the pall<br>
lug 60 rides on the toggle arms 69 to bypass the intermediate detent position 57 on<br>
clamp link 40. In this manner, the closure and firing triggers 26, 27 can return to their<br>
original, unactuated positions in response to the bias created from the closure spring<br>
42 and firing bar return spring 55. When the pall lug rides 60 on the toggle arms of<br>
the toggles 68, the toggle arms 69 rotate counterclockwise as the closure and firing<br>
triggers 26, 27 rotate in a clockwise direction to return to their original unactuated<br>
positions. Therefore, the surgeon can release the closure and firing triggers 26, 27 so<br>
that they can return to the positions illustrated in FIGURE 20 without unnecessarily<br>
returning to the intermediate detent 57 position.<br>
The release of the linear surgical stapler 20 to the open position shown in<br>
FIGURE 20 causes the closure member 28 and the attached lockout lever 181 to<br>
retract to the full open position as shown in FIGURE 36. In this position the post<br>
188 on the driver 131 is no longer disposed to hold down the lockout lever distal end<br>
185.   The driver 131, as described above, has been detented into place in the forward<br>
position by post 140 and the cartridge detent 142.    Hence, when the lockout lever<br>
181, whose proximal end 184 slides along support arm surface 86, is fully retracted it is<br>
now free to rotate counter-clockwise and drop lockout groove 187 below ledge 85 on<br>
the U-shaped supporting structure 81. The lockout lever 181 will remain in this<br>
position when the cartridge module 120 is removed as shown in FIGURE 37.<br>
Any future attempt to close the linear surgical stapler 20 which has been fired<br>
will result in the lockout groove 187 hooking into the ledge 85 as shown in FIGURE<br>
38, supplying feedback to the user of a previously fired device.   This same feature will<br>
engage if the retainer 160 has been removed prior to loading and the cartridge module<br>
120 has been misloaded without the cartridge module 120 being in the right position.<br>
In this case the driver post 188 would not be in the right position to move lockout<br>
lever 181 into the position to be cammed up onto surface 86 as described above.<br>
Similarly, a cartridge module 120 that has already been fired would also not release the<br>
lockout mechanism 180. It is important to note that there is closure stroke travel<br>
allowed in the lockout mechanism 180 prior to engagement of the lockout groove 187<br>
hooking into the ledge 85. This travel indicates to the user that the device is not<br>
jammed due to some malfunction as might be the reaction if the lockout mechanism<br>
180 had no travel. Hence, the user knows that the device is not jammed but<br>
incorrectly loaded when the lockout mechanism engages.<br>
After release of the device back to the open position shown in FIGURES 1 and 2,<br>
the retaining pin mechanism 100 must be manually retracted by pulling proximally on<br>
saddle 101. The retraction causes the retaining pin 125 to retract back into the cartridge<br>
housing 121. At the completion of the manual retraction the fired cartridge module 120<br>
can be unloaded and replaced with a new cartridge module 120.<br>
While the preferred embodiments have been shown and described, it will be<br>
understood that there is no intent to limit the invention by such disclosure, but rather, is<br>
intended to cover all modifications and alternate constructions falling within the spirit and<br>
scope of the invention.<br>
