				<td>Apparatus for processing sheet material<br>
[0001] The invention relates to an apparatus for processing sheet material, in<br>
particular a bank note processing machine, wherein the sheet material is held between<br>
a conveyor belt and further transport devices disposed opposite the conveyor belt and<br>
guided through between at least two components of a checking device disposed<br>
opposite each other.<br>
[0002] The conveyor belt serves for guiding and for pressing the sheet material<br>
against the transport devices disposed opposite and against guiding paths or checking<br>
devices disposed in between. The transport devices usually are transport rolls or<br>
transport rollers or a second conveyor belt, which with the help of deflection rollers is<br>
either led back directly before and behind the checking device or is led around the<br>
checking device.<br>
[0003] As to maintain a reliable transport function even with fluctuating sheet<br>
thickness, in DE 198 40 420 A1 is proposed that the run of the first conveyer belt<br>
facing the material is loaded elastically in the direction of the sheet material by<br>
pressure elements. In DE 29 23 148 Al it is furthermore proposed to guide the second<br>
conveyor belt on deflection rollers in grooves, so that the speed of the sheet material is<br>
determined by the first conveyor belt located external in deflection direction. The<br>
internal, second conveyor belt merely serves for supporting the sheet material between<br>
adjacent deflection rollers, whereas such support instead can also be obtained by a<br>
transparent glass plate replacing the second conveyor belt, when the sheet material is to<br>
be accessible over its entire width for checking purposes.<br>
[0004] The first conveyor belt assuming guiding and pressing function in the area<br>
of the checking device, however, impedes the carrying out of a transmission<br>
measuring at the sheet material. A soiling measurement is also impeded, since for<br>
such a measurement the sheet material usually has to be illuminated from two sides.<br>
Therefore, the first conveyor belt usually is replaced by a plurality of narrow belts<br>
extending in parallel side-by-side in transport direction and spaced apart from each<br>
other. But, however, also with this a full areal measurement of the sheet material<br><br>
over its entire width is not possible. The positions of the belts are rather perceived<br>
as dark longitudinal stripes when evaluating e.g. transmitted light.<br>
[0005] As to ensure free accessibility for checking purposes, therefore, the<br>
transport path must be interrupted and the sheet material measured in free flight by<br>
the checking device. Such a measurement during free flight, however, is<br>
problematic in the case of low transport speeds and in particular in the case of limp<br>
sheet material. Here gravity can incalculably influence the sheet material and lead<br>
to the blocking of the machine. DE-A 26 55 580 describes such a free-flight path,<br>
the bank notes being conveyed clamped between a plurality of belt pairs. Before and<br>
behind the checking device the belts are led away from the transport path via<br>
deflection rollers, so that the sheet material passes the checking device in free<br>
flight. Here the belt pairs located opposite each other are disposed to each other so<br>
as to fill gaps and slightly mesh with each other. Thereby onto the transported bank<br>
notes is impressed a reversible wave profile perpendicular to the transport direction<br>
which leads to an increase of the stiffness of the sheet material in the transport<br>
direction. In this way the free-flight path can be reliably covered. The profiling can<br>
be effected by the transport belts, but it can also be obtained by elastic rings<br>
disposed on the deflection rollers, the circumference of which projecting in radial<br>
direction of the deflection rollers over the transport belts. But it becomes<br>
immediately obvious, that the checking of a sheet material deformed in a wave-<br>
shaped fashion cannot be carried out in a very reliable and regular fashion.<br>
[0006] Therefore, it is the problem of the present invention to propose an<br>
apparatus for processing sheet material, wherein the sheet material is reliably<br>
guided past a checking device in such a way that it is accessible from both sides<br>
over its entire width and reliably checkable.<br>
[0007] This problem is solved by an apparatus having the features of the<br>
independent claim 1. In claims dependent on this are specified advantageous<br>
developments and embodiments of the invention.<br>
[0008] Similar to DE-A 26 55 580 the solution according to the invention provides<br>
clamping rings coaxially to the deflection roller, which slightly project over the<br><br>
conveyor belt guided on the deflection roller, so that the sheet material at the<br>
moment at which it is introduced between the two components of the checking<br>
device, is lifted from the conveyor belt. The sheet material is clamped between the<br>
clamping rings and the transport devices located opposite the clamping rings. In<br>
contrast to the DE-A 26 55 580 the clamping rings here do not serve for impressing a<br>
reversible wave-shaped profile onto the sheet material in order to thereby obtain an<br>
increase of the stiffness of the sheet material. The sheet material rather is reliably<br>
grasped and guided with the help of the clamping rings. For supporting this process<br>
there is a guide plate combing with the clamping rings. In the slot between the<br>
guide plate and the component of the checking device disposed opposite the guide<br>
plate is located the sheet material in a defined plane position. As to ensure that the<br>
sheet material is accessible from two sides, the guide plate is to be adjusted<br>
according to the requirements of the respective checking devices and is made of,<br>
for example, a material pervious to radiation such as plastic or glass and can be<br>
designed in multiple fashions, for example also as a latticed plate. The sheet<br>
material is lifted off the conveyor belt with the help of the clamping rings and<br>
guided along the guide plate combing with the clamping rings in a plane alignment<br>
through between the two components of the checking device. The influence of<br>
gravity on the guiding of the sheet material is negligible in the case of transport<br>
speeds of 10 m/s, and also at transport speeds of 5 m/s the influence is so weak that<br>
difficulties are not to be expected.<br>
[0009] The transport devices located opposite the conveyor belt, for example, can<br>
be transport rollers spaced apart from each other, the clamping rings co-operating<br>
with transport rollers or sensor rollers disposed in transport direction directly<br>
before and preferably also behind the checking device. The transport devices,<br>
however, can also comprise a further conveyor belt, which is led away from the<br>
transport path before the checking device with the help of at least one deflection<br>
roller. In this case the clamping rings can either co-operate directly with a surface<br>
of the second conveyor belt or with respective clamping rings disposed coaxial to<br>
the deflection roller of the second conveyor belt.<br><br>
[0010] Preferably, the conveyor belt or the conveyor belts are led around the<br>
checking device with the help of the deflection roller and, optionally, further<br>
deflection rollers. This offers substantial functional advantages compared to<br>
conveyor belts that before and behind the checking device are reversed by 180°<br>
with the help of reversing rollers, since e.g. damaged parts of bank notes cannot jam<br>
between roller and returning belts, which otherwise would lead to failures in<br>
transport.<br>
[0011] Advantageously, the clamping rings at least along their outside<br>
circumference are made of elastic material, such as polyurethane or silicone. Such<br>
clamping rings can deform during the transport of multiple picks without the lift of<br>
the axis of rotation of the clamping ring in such a way that such multiple picks can<br>
be transported through between the clamping rings and the opposite transport<br>
devices without the occurrence of jams. The circumference path of the clamping<br>
rings preferably slightly overlaps with a circumference path of the opposite co-<br>
operating transport device, so that always a minimum pressure is provided between<br>
the clamping rings and the opposite transport devices for the reliable transport of<br>
the sheet material.<br>
[0012] For reasons of design it is preferred to dispose the clamping rings and the<br>
at least one deflection roller on one common shaft, here the clamping rings in the<br>
simplest case can be disposed as elevations on the surface of the deflection roller or<br>
as separate clamping rings disposed between the individual belts of the conveyor<br>
belt and radially projecting over these. Preferably, however, the clamping rings are<br>
rollers passively rotating independent of the deflection rollers, which rotate along<br>
with the opposite actively driven transport device. This preferred variant has<br>
several advantages. On the one hand with clamping rings rigidly connected to the<br>
deflection roller the circumferential speed and thus the transport speed of the<br>
clamping rings acting upon the sheet material would be larger than the transport<br>
speed of the conveyor belt, since the clamping rings at least slightly radially project<br>
over the conveyor belt. This is avoided, when the transport speed is determined by<br>
the transport devices located opposite the clamping rings. On the other hand due to<br>
the elastic clamping rings no inert masses of the roller support have to be overcome,<br><br>
when the sheet material is fed into the checking device. Merely an elastic deformation<br>
of the clamping ring jacket occurs. With that a troublefree transport even of e.g. ten<br>
multiple picks is possible.<br>
[0013] A further advantageous embodiment provides that the clamping rings are<br>
rigidly connected to each other, so that they run absolutely uniform. In this way it can<br>
be avoided that the sheet material is inclined when fed into the checking device.<br>
[0014] A preferred embodiment of the guide plate provides that it defines a guiding<br>
channel for the sheet material to be checked located relative to the component of the<br>
checking device disposed opposite the guide plate, the narrowest point of the guiding<br>
channel lying in transport direction behind the clamping rings, so that the sheet<br>
material can be fed unimpeded before the clamping point and then can be grasped by<br>
the elastic clamping rings.<br>
[0015] Furthermore, it has proved to be advantageous when the guide plate is<br>
slightly inclined, so that the guiding channel continuously widens behind the narrowest<br>
point.<br>
[0016] In the following the invention is described by way of example with reference<br>
to the accompanying figures.<br>
[0017] Figure 1 shows a schematic detail of a bank note processing apparatus<br>
having a plurality of sensor places SP 1 to SP 5,<br>
[0018] Figure 2 shows a partial section of Figure 1 with one single sensor place<br>
according to a first embodiment,<br>
[0019] Figure 3 shows a deflection roller with clamping rings,<br>
[0020] Figure 4 shows a combination of two deflection rollers with clamping<br>
rings and guide plate combing therewith, and<br>
[0021] Figure 5 shows a partial section of Figure 1 with one individual sensor<br>
place according to a second embodiment.<br><br>
[0022] Figure 1 schematically shows a detail of a bank note processing apparatus<br>
with a total of 5 sensor places SP 1 to SP 5. Bank notes 100 are guided along a<br>
transport path 1 past the sensor places SP. The transport path 1 on the one side of<br>
the transported bank notes is formed by a conveyor belt 2 and on the other side by<br>
' transport rollers 3 in transport direction spaced apart from each other. The bank<br>
notes 100 are held between the conveyor belt 2 and the transport rollers 3 located<br>
opposite and are guided past the sensor places SP, which in each case are disposed<br>
between two adjacent transport rollers 3. By means of the arc-shaped arrangement<br>
of adjacent sensor places SP each disposed at an angle of 3° or more it is achieved<br>
that the conveyor belt 2 can exert a pressure force onto the transported bank notes<br>
100 in the direction of the sensor places SP without additional pressing devices.<br>
Instead of the transport rollers 3 located opposite the conveyor belt 2 optionally<br>
other transport devices can be provided. In particular, the transport rollers 3 can be<br>
deflection rollers of a conveyor belt located opposite the conveyor belt 2. If a<br>
sensor place SP is not occupied by a sensor, the transport path in the respective area<br>
can be realized by a simple guide plate.<br>
[0023] In the shown embodiment all of the five sensor places are occupied, the in<br>
transport direction first three sensors SP 1 to SP 3 and the last sensor SP 4 being<br>
adapted to sense one side of the bank notes guided past them. Also the fourth sensor<br>
at the sensor place SP 4 serves for sensing one side of the bank note 100. But in this<br>
case it is a transmission sensor 4, which requires an illumination of the bank notes<br>
100 from the opposite bank note side with the help of a radiation source 5, in order<br>
to being able to deliver measuring results. As to being able to irradiate the bank<br>
notes 100 over the entire transport width with the help of the radiation source 5 and<br>
to sense them with the help of the opposite sensor 4, the conveyor belt 2 in the<br>
respective section is led away from the transport path 1 with the help of a first<br>
deflection roller 6, is led around the radiation source 5 and with the help of a<br>
second deflection roller 7 again is led towards the transport path 1. Between the<br>
two deflection rollers 6 and 7 the transport path 1 is completed by a guide plate 8.<br>
Then the bank notes 100 are transported through a guiding channel formed between<br><br>
the guide plate 8 and the sensor 4 and are irradiated through the guide plate 8 by<br>
the radiation source 5.<br>
[0024] Figure 2 shows a section of Figure 1 in the area of the sensor place SP 4 in<br>
more detail. The conveyor belt 2 consists of a plurality of round belts not<br>
represented in detail, running in parallel to each other, which with the help of the<br>
first deflection roller 6 are led away from the transport path 1 and with the help of<br>
the second deflection roller 7 again are led towards the transport path 1. From the<br>
first deflection roller 6 represented as a sectional view one can notice, that the<br>
individual round belts of the conveyor belt 2 run in pertinent grooves 9. The depth<br>
of the grooves 9 is selected larger than the thickness of the conveyor belt 2. The<br>
external circumference of the deflection roller 6 thus radially projects over the<br>
conveyor belt 2 and assumes the function of a clamping ring* 10. This clamping ring<br>
10 and the transport roller 3 located opposite the clamping ring 10 grasp a bank<br>
note fed with the help of the conveyor belt 2, lift the bank note from the conveyor<br>
belt 2 and transport it through between the sensor 4 and the radiation source 5. The<br>
second deflection roller 7 has the same structure and co-operates with the transport<br>
roller 3 located opposite in exactly the same way as the first deflection roller 6.<br>
[0025] The clamping ring 10 or at least its surface is formed of an elastic<br>
material, such as polyurethane or silicone. The circumferential lines of the<br>
clamping ring 10 and the transport roller 3 located opposite slightly overlap each<br>
other by for example 0.2 millimeters, so that on the one hand the reliable grasping of<br>
an introduced bank note is ensured by producing a minimum pressure on the bank<br>
note, and on the other hand multiple picks of for example up to 10 bank notes can<br>
be transported between the clamping ring 10 and the transport roller 3 without a lift<br>
of the deflection roller 6.<br>
[0026] Various guide elements are provided, so as to ensure the plane transport of<br>
the bank note past the sensor 4. For this purpose the guide plate 8 together with the<br>
sensor head of the opposite sensor 4 and with guide combs 12 disposed in transport<br>
direction before and behind the sensor head form a guiding channel 11. The guide<br>
plate 8 is adjustable (not displayed) as to being able to adjust the guiding channel to<br><br>
the sheet material to be processed. Usually, however, the slot width is adjusted to<br>
an optimal value exclusively before the delivery of the apparatus to the customer.<br>
The introduction zone 13 of the guide plate 8 combs with the clamping rings 10 of<br>
the deflection roller 6. In a corresponding fashion the guide combs 12 comb with the<br>
transport rollers 3. That means, the transport rollers 3 also have parallel<br>
circumferential grooves, which are not explicitly displayed in Figure 2. The end of<br>
the introduction zone 13 of the guide plate 8 is bent away from the transport path 1,<br>
as to ensure a reliable introduction of the bank notes into the guiding channel 11.<br>
The transport slot for the bank notes defined by the guiding channel 11 has a<br>
narrowest slot width located at a minor distance a behind the contact point of the<br>
clamping ring 10 and the opposite transport roller 3. This distance a preferably<br>
amounts to about 4 to 5 millimeters with a narrowest slot width of 1.5 millimeters.<br>
The slot width of the guiding channel 11 continuously widens in transport direction<br>
beginning at the narrowest point to reach an amount of for example about 2.5<br>
millimeters at the end of the guiding channel. By displacing the guide plate 8 the<br>
distance a, the narrowest slot width and the'maximum slot width at the end of the<br>
guidjng channel can be varied. As already mentioned these adjustments usually<br>
have to be effected only once before the delivery to the customer.<br>
[0027] Figure 3 in further detail shows the structural design of the deflection<br>
roller 6 with the clamping rings 10. In this specific embodiment the conveyor belt<br>
consists of three parallel endless belts, which in each case run on an individually<br>
mounted individual roller 16 of the deflection roller 6. Between the individual<br>
rollers 16 are provided the clamping rings 10, which are formed as independent<br>
clamping rollers. The clamping rollers 10 and the individual rollers 16 are thread<br>
onto an inside-located continuous shaft 30 and gripped with screws 14 at the two<br>
ends. The rollers 10, 16 are passively operated. I.e., while the individual rollers 16<br>
rotate with the transport speed of the endless belts running on them, the clamping<br>
rollers 10 passively rotate via the bearings 31 along with the opposite actively<br>
driven transport roller 3. The rotating speed of the individual rollers 16 thus not<br>
necessarily is identical with the rotating speed of the clamping rollers 10. Therefore,<br>
the clamping rollers 10 run on the shaft 30 mounted with bearing 31 independently of<br><br>
the individual rollers 16. However, the clamping rollers 10 are gripped by the two<br>
screws 14, rigidly connected to each other, so as to avoid an off-track running of the<br>
bank notes when introduced between the clamping Tollers 10 and the transport roller<br>
3 located opposite the clamping rollers 10.<br>
[0028] Figure 4 shows, in a perspective view onto the sliding plate, an assembly<br>
consisting of the deflection roller-6 and the deflection roller 7 together with the<br>
pertinent individual rollers 16 and clamping rings or clamping rollers 10 and the<br>
guide plate 8 combing therewith. One can notice that the guide plate 8 does not only<br>
comb with the clamping rings or clamping rollers 10 but at the same time also with<br>
the individual rollers 16.<br>
[0029] Figure 5 shows a further embodiment, which differs from the embodiment<br>
shown in Figure 2 mainly in that instead of the radiation source 5 a second sensor 15<br>
is provided, as to sense the two sides of the bank notes transported through the guiding<br>
channel 11. Accordingly, the guide plate 8 is formed as to be shorter, since the sensor<br>
head of the sensor 15 assumes the guiding function in the guiding channel 11. It has<br>
turned out to be advantageous, when the introduction edge of the sensors 4 and 15 is<br>
slightly moved backwards in relation to the transport plane of the guide plate 8 or of<br>
the guide element 12 by for example 0.5 millimeters and forms a short, flat<br>
introduction inclination.<br><br>

Disclosed is a banknote<br>
processing machine in which banknotes (100)<br>
are directed through two components of an<br>
examining mechanism (4) by means of a belt<br>
conveyor (2). Said belt conveyor is directed<br>
away from the path of conveyance (1) and<br>
around the examining mechanism by means of<br>
deflection rollers (6, 7). Clamping rings (10)<br>
or clamping rollers that grab the sheet material<br>
and direct the same through the examining<br>
mechanism are provided coaxial to the<br>
deflection rollers. Said process is supported<br>
by a directing plate (8) which meshes with the<br>
