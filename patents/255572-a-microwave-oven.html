				<td>A MICROWAVE OVEN<br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention is related to a microwave oven, and more<br>
particularly, to a microwave radiating structure of microwave<br>
oven, in which microwave is more effectively distributed in a<br>
cavity, such that users can cook food evenly in a convenient<br>
way.<br>
Background Art<br>
A microwave oven is a cooking device that cooks food by<br>
passing a microwave through the food. The microwave oven<br>
uses a magnetron to generate the microwave from an electric<br>
current.<br>
Generally, a microwave oven is a device that is used to<br>
heat food by radiating microwave generated from a magnetron<br>
to the food when electric current is applied to electric<br>
components of the device.<br>
 Such a microwave oven is classified into a household<br>
microwave oven having a small magnetron and a commercial<br>
microwave oven having a large (or a plurality of) magnetron.<br>
The microwave oven is further classified according to a<br>
heating method into a glass tray method rotating the food and<br>
a stirrer fan method scattering microwave radiated into the<br>
cavity. The former is generally applied to the household<br>
microwave oven while the latter is applied to the commercial<br>
microwave oven. In the stirrer fan method, a stirrer is used<br>
to uniformly distribute the microwave about a cavity where<br>
food is loaded. Since the commercial microwave oven is<br>
generally used at convenience stores where the microwave oven<br>
is frequently used and restaurants where a large amount of<br>
the food should be quickly heated, the commercial microwave<br>
oven needs relatively high power output compared with the<br>
household microwave oven.<br>
A microwave oven of the stirrer fan method includes: a<br><br><br>
magnetron for generating microwave; a waveguide provided at<br>
an upper side and lower side of a cavity, for guiding the<br>
generated microwave from the magnetron toward a cavity, in<br>
which food is loaded; a stirrer fan disposed at an outlet of<br>
the waveguide; and a motor for driving the stirrer fan. To<br>
fix the motor on an outside surface of the waveguide, a screw<br>
is used and the screw is protruded from an inside surface of<br>
the waveguide. A screw covering part is provided at the<br>
inside surface of the waveguide, where the screw is<br>
protruded, in order to prevent the protruded screw from<br>
interrupting the microwave flow.<br>
In operation, the microwave generated at the magnetron<br>
passes from an inlet of the waveguide and to an outlet of the<br>
waveguide, and enters the cavity while scattered and<br>
reflected by the stirrer fan. The microwave can be uniformly<br>
distributed about the cavity owing to the stirrer fan and<br>
thereby food can be cooked evenly.<br>
However, the related art structure for radiating<br>
microwave has several drawbacks.<br>
 The screw covering part narrows the microwave passage<br>
-in the waveguide and thereby the microwave is converged with<br>
an undesired pattern, this causes the microwave to be<br>
unevenly distributed about the cavity, such that the cavity<br>
can be partially stained with soot due to partial exposure to<br>
 intensive microwave and of cause food cannot be evenly<br>
 cooked.<br>
 Further, though the stirrer fan scatters and reflects<br>
the microwave into the cavity, the microwave is not<br>
sufficiently distributed about the cavity so that food cannot<br>
be cooked evenly.<br>
Furthermore, because of the non-uniform distribution of<br>
 the microwave in the cavity, it takes much more time to cook<br>
 the food.<br>
Disclosure<br><br>
Technical Problem.<br>
Accordingly the present invention is directed to a<br>
microwave oven and radiating structure of microwave in<br>
microwave oven that substantially obviate one or more<br>
problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related<br>
art.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
microwave oven and radiating structure of microwave in<br>
microwave oven, in which microwave is uniformly distributed<br>
about a cavity.<br>
 Another object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
microwave oven and radiating structure of microwave in<br>
microwave oven, in which a cavity can be maintained clean<br>
without being stained with soot and food can be cooked more<br>
speedily.<br>
A further another object of the present invention is to<br>
provide a microwave oven and radiating structure of microwave<br>
in microwave oven, in which food is heated more evenly so<br>
that cooking of the food can be done more speedily.<br>
Technical Solution<br>
To achieve these objects and other advantages and in<br>
accordance with the purpose of the invention, as embodied and<br>
broadly described herein, there is provided a microwave oven<br>
including: a cavity for accommodating food to be cooked, of<br>
which at least one side defining an. opening; a door for<br>
shielding the opening selectively; a magnetron disposed at an<br>
outside of the cavity, for generating microwave; a waveguide<br>
for guiding the generated microwave into the cavity; a<br>
stirrer fan disposed at an outlet of the waveguide, for<br>
scattering the microwave guided by the waveguide; a motor<br>
fixed at an outside of the waveguide and of which shaft is<br>
connected with the stirrer fan; a screw covering part formed<br>
by modifying a portion of the waveguide to accommodate a<br>
motor fixing screw; a convergence preventing part formed at a<br>
portion of the cavity, with a shape corresponding to that of<br><br>
the screw covering part and at location corresponding to<br>
that of the screw covering part.<br>
Advantageous Effects<br>
A microwave oven of the present invention is<br>
provided such that food can be cooked more speedily and of<br>
course microwave can be distributed more uniformly about a<br>
cavity.<br>
Further, microwave is more efficiently used to cook<br>
a food.<br>

Best Mode<br>
A microwave oven and its microwave radiating structure<br>
according to the present invention will now be described more<br>
fully with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
FIG. 1 is an exploded perspective view of a microwave<br>
oven according to the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, a microwave oven includes an outer<br>
case forming the exterior of the microwave oven, a cavity 20<br>
in which food is loaded, and an electric component chamber 30<br>
in which electric components are mounted. Further, a door 40<br>
is provided at a front of the cavity 20, for shielding the<br>
cavity 20 selectively.<br>
The structure of the microwave oven will now be<br>
described.<br>
The outer case forms the exterior of the microwave<br>
oven, and as well covers and protects the cavity 20.<br>
Therefore, the outer case may be made of an iron plate having<br>
a desired strength. The outer case includes an upper plate<br>
11 covering a top and each side of the cavity 20, a base<br>
plate 13 protecting a bottom of the cavity 20, a front plate<br>
15 forming the front of the cavity 20, and a back plate 17<br>
protecting a back of the cavity 20.<br>
The cavity 20, in which food is to be loaded for<br>
cooking, has a box-like shape with a front opening.. That is,<br>
the food is loaded through the opening for cooking and is<br>
unloaded after the cooking through the opening. The door 4 0<br>
selectively shields the cavity 20 after the loading or<br>
unloading of the food.<br>
The cavity 20 is provides at an outer top surface with<br><br>
a waveguide 21 in order to guide microwave generated at a<br>
magnetron toward the cavity 20. A motor 22 is provided at an<br>
outlet of the waveguide 21 to drive a stirrer fan. The<br>
stirrer fan as it rotates distributes the microwave uniformly<br>
about the cavity 20. The waveguide 21 is also provided at an<br>
outer bottom surface of the cavity 20 as well as the outer<br>
top surface, such that the microwave can be guided both in<br>
downward and upward directions, thereby evenly cooking the<br>
food.	<br>
The electric component chamber 30 is located at a a right<br>
in the outer case to accommodate a plurality of electric<br>
components for the operation of the microwave oven. In the<br>
electric component chamber 30, electric components such as a<br>
transformer 31, a magnetron 33, a blower fan 35, a capacitor<br>
37 are mounted, and also a barrier 39 is formed between the<br>
transformer 31 and the blower fan 35. The transformer 31,<br>
blower fan 35, capacitor 37, and barrier 39 are mounted on a<br>
sub-plate 14 that is spaced apart from a top surface of a<br>
base plate 13.<br>
The plurality of electric components, especially the<br>
transformer 31 and magnetron 33, are used to generate the<br>
microwave to be guided toward the cavity 20. When the<br>
electric components generate the microwave, heat is also<br>
generated in the electric component chamber 30 and thereby<br>
the temperature of electric component chamber 30 increases<br>
during the cooking. Therefore the blower fan 35 is provided<br>
to cool the electric component chamber 30 by sucking an<br>
ambient air.<br>
FIG. 2 is a sectional view taken on I-I' in FIG. 1, in<br>
which a microwave radiating structure above the cavity 20 is<br>
shown.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, the microwave oven includes a<br>
magnetron 33 at a right side beside the cavity 20. The<br>
magnetron 33 receives a high voltage from the transformer 31,<br>
generates microwave, and radiates the microwave at its upper<br>
antenna 111 toward the waveguide 21. Since a leading end of<br><br>
the antenna 111 is located in the waveguide 21, the microwave<br>
generated at the magnetron 33 can be radiated toward the<br>
inside of the waveguide 21.<br>
The waveguide 21, a passage of the microwave, includes<br>
an inlet in which the antenna 111 is inserted and an outlet<br>
located at a top center of the cavity 20. The waveguide 21<br>
is tightly disposed on the outer top of the cavity 20.<br>
The motor 22 is provided at the outlet of the waveguide<br>
21 and coupled with the. stirrer fan to drive the stirrer fan.<br>
The motor 22 is fixed at a top surface of the waveguide<br>
21 by using a motor fixing bracket. To mount the motor<br>
fixing bracket on the top surface of the waveguide 21, a<br>
coupling hole is defined in the motor fixing bracket. To<br>
mount the motor 22, a screw is applied at a right inside of<br>
the waveguide 21. Also, a screw covering part 112 is<br>
protruded from the right inside of the waveguide 21 in order<br>
to prevent the screw from exposure to the inside of the<br>
waveguide 21, such that microwave . leakage, between the screw<br>
and the coupling hole ; can be prevented. Also, the screw<br>
covering part 112 prevents the microwave from colliding with<br>
the screw. Thus, it is possible to prevent concentration and<br>
reflection of microwave in undesired direction- In addition,<br>
deterioration of the screw can be prevented.<br>
A stirrer fan 13.0 is provided under the outlet of the<br>
waveguide 21, i.e., at a top center inside of" the cavity 20.<br>
The stirrer fan 130, driven by the motor 22, distributes the<br>
microwave passed the waveguide 21 toward the cavity 20. That<br>
is, the microwave can be uniformly distributed about the<br>
cavity by driving the stirrer fan 130.<br>
An upper cover 15.0 is provided under the stirrer fan<br>
130, i.e., at an upper location of the cavity 20 in order to<br>
prevent the stirrer fan 130 from exposure to the cavity 20<br>
and in order to guide airflows into and out of the cavity 20.<br>
A convergence preventing part 14 0, corresponding to the<br>
screw covering part 112, is formed by recessing a portion of<br>
an outer top surface of the cavity 20 downwardly. That is,<br><br>
the shapes and location of the convergence preventing part<br>
140 and screw covering part 112 are corresponding to each<br>
other. The convergence preventing part 140 is provided to<br>
compensate for interference between the microwave and the<br>
screw covering part 1.12.<br>
Since the recession of the convergence preventing part<br>
140 and the protrusion of the screw covering part 112 are<br>
corresponding to each other, a microwave passage in the<br>
waveguide 21 can have a uniform height. That is, referring<br>
again to FIG. 2, big "H" denotes a height of the waveguide 21<br>
at a right location where its slope ends, small "h" denotes a<br>
height between the screw covering part 112 and the<br>
convergence preventing part 140, and the height "H" and "h"<br>
have the same value.<br>
As described above, though the protrusion of screw<br>
covering part 112 narrows the microwave passage in the<br>
waveguide 21, the recession of the convergence preventing<br>
part 140 make up for the narrowed microwave passage, such the<br>
microwave passage in the waveguide 21 can maintain uniform<br>
size therethrough and thereby the microwave can pass through<br>
the waveguide 21 toward the cavity 20 without converging.<br>
FIG. 3 is a view of a cavity of a microwave oven,<br>
viewed in the cavity upwardly.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, the convergence preventing part<br>
14 0 may be formed at two places in case the motor 22 is fixed<br>
with two screws at both side and thereby two screw covering<br>
parts 112 are required. If three screw covering parts 112<br>
are formed, three convergence preventing parts 140 are also<br>
required. That is, the number and shape of the 14 0<br>
correspond to those of the screw covering part 112.<br>
In case another microwave radiating structure is<br>
provided at a lower side of the cavity 20, the convergence<br>
preventing part 140 is also formed at the lower side. That<br>
is, the location of the convergence preventing part 140 is<br>
not limited to the upper side of the cavity; the convergence<br>
preventing part 140 can be formed at any location where the<br><br>
microwave radiating structure is provided.<br>
Hereinafter, forming the convergence preventing part<br>
140 at the upper side, of the cavity 20 will be described.<br>
The cavity 20 may be formed by attaching several pieces<br>
of iron plates or by bending a long iron plate several times.<br>
When using the several pieces of iron plates for forming the<br>
cavity 20, the several pieces of iron plates may be made by a<br>
blanking using a die and press, the iron plates may be<br>
attached together for forming the cavity 20 by using a<br>
welding method, and a die for an upper iron plate may be<br>
modified to form the convergence preventing part 140<br>
integrally with the upper plate.<br>
When using the long iron plate for forming the cavity<br>
20, blanking and bending are performed on the long iron plate<br>
in sequence or at the same time, in a generally method.<br>
Therefore, it is preferable to form the convergence<br>
preventing part 14 0 at the blanking process with a<br>
predetermined tool, for example, combination of a groove in<br>
lower die and projection at upper die.<br>
 The function of the convergence preventing part 140,<br>
prevention of the microwave convergence, will be described<br>
more fully.<br>
The magnetron 33. generates a microwave and radiates it<br>
at the antenna 111 toward the waveguide 21. The microwave<br>
passes from the inlet of the waveguide 21 to the' outlet of<br>
the waveguide 21. When the microwave passes by the protruded<br>
screw covering part 112 at the outlet of the waveguide 21,<br>
the microwave will be converged and reflected with an<br>
undesired pattern unless the recessed convergence preventing<br>
part 140 is not formed under the screw covering part 112.<br>
That is, the convergence preventing part 140 prevent the<br>
microwave passage in the waveguide 21 from being narrowed by<br>
the screw covering part 112, such that the microwave can pass<br>
the waveguide 21 without interference and convergence.<br>
As described above, the microwave convergence in the<br>
waveguide 21 due to the screw covering part 112 can be<br><br>
prevented by the convergence preventing part 140.<br>
Hereinafter, the microwave radiating structure at the<br>
lower side of the cavity 20 will be described. If the cavity<br>
has the same microwave radiating structure both at the lower<br>
side and the upper side, the lower structure can radiate<br>
microwave with the same way and operation as the upper<br>
structure.<br>
Because of practical reason, however, the lower<br>
structure of radiating microwave is generally different from<br>
the upper structure in order to increase cooking efficiency.<br>
FIG. 4 is a front perspective view of a microwave oven,<br>
in which a lower plate of a cavity is shown, and FIG. 5 is an<br>
enlarged view of a portion "A" in FIG. 4.<br>
Referring to FIGs. 4 and 5, there are provided a<br>
waveguide (not shown) at a lower side of the cavity 20 for<br>
guiding microwave and a motor 24 0 at an outlet of the<br>
waveguide for uniformly distributing the microwave about the<br>
cavity 20.<br>
A lower plate 120 is provided at a lower side of the<br>
cavity 20 for protecting the lower side of the cavity 20.<br>
The lower plate 120 includes a through hole 121 and fixing<br>
holes 122 at a center. Through the through hole 121, a<br>
stirrer fan 200 is coupled with a shaft of the motor 24 0<br>
provided at an outer surface of the lower plate 120. The<br>
fixing hole 122 is provided to mount the stirrer fan 200 on<br>
the lower plate 120. The. waveguide extending from the<br>
magnetron 33 is located under the stirrer fan 200. <br>
The stirrer fan 200 is tightly mounted on the lower<br>
plate 120. The stirrer fan 200 includes a rotating fan 210<br>
and a holder 230. The rotating fan 210 is made of a<br>
conductive metal plate and bent at its outer end in the left<br>
direction to have a "¬"-like shape. Since the rotating fan<br>
210 is made of a conductive metal plate, the microwave guided<br>
by the waveguide can be transmitted directly to the rotating<br>
fan 210. Also, the "¬"-like shape of the rotating fan 210<br>
allows the transmitted microwave to be more uniformly<br><br>
distributed about the cavity 20 during rotation of the<br>
rotating fan 210. The shape of the rotating fan 210 is not<br>
limited to the "¬"-like shape; it can be changed.<br>
The holder 230 is provided to rotatably mount the<br>
rotating fan 210 on the lower plate 120. The stirrer fan 200<br>
is fixed at the lower plate 120 by inserting and fixing<br>
rivets 250 through coupling holes 231 and the lower plate<br>
120.<br>
Further, the lower plate 120 includes an elevated<br>
portion 300 projected upwardly. The elevated portion 300 has<br>
an upwardly narrowed shape, i.e., a hemispheric shape. The<br>
elevated portion 300 includes a front elevated portion 301 at<br>
a front of the lower plate 120, adjacent to the opening of<br>
the cavity 20, and a rear elevated portion 302. Preferably,<br>
there may be a plurality of front elevated portions 301 and a<br>
plurality of rear elevated portions 302. The front and rear<br>
elevated portions 301 and 302 distribute the microwave<br>
scattered from the rotating fan 210 more widely about the<br>
cavity 20.<br>
The front and rear elevated portions 301 and 302 are<br>
arranged around the outside of the rotating fan 210, for<br>
preventing interference between the rotating fan 210 and the<br>
elevated portions 301; and 302 when the rotating fan 210<br>
rotates and for reflecting the microwave scattered at the<br>
outer end of the rotating fan 210 more widely.<br>
The front elevated portions 301 are arranged in a fort<br>
line, the rear elevated pprtions 302 are arranged in a rear<br>
line, and they are facing each other to form a rectangular<br>
arrangement with an evenly spaced relationship. Therefore<br>
the microwave from the rotating fan 210 can be distributed<br>
evenly throughout the cavity 20.<br>
The front and rear elevated portions 301 and 302 are<br>
integrally formed with the lower plate 120 as shown in FIG.<br>
5. However, separate members can be mounted on the lower<br>
plate 120 to form the elevated portion 300.<br>
Further, the number of the elevated portion 300 may<br><br>
vary according to the capacity of the microwave oven or<br>
designer's selection. For example, 1800-Watt microwave oven<br>
may be provided with four elevated portions, and 1000-Watt to<br>
1200-Watt microwave oven, relatively low capacity microwave<br>
oven, may be provided with two elevated portions. It is also<br>
apparent that the number of the elevated portion 300 may vary<br>
according to the capacity of the cavity.<br>
Forming process of the front and rear elevated portions<br>
301	and 302 on the lower plate 120 will be described. The<br>
lower plate 120 is generally made of a metal plate having a<br>
desired strength. The metal plate is placed between a die<br>
set having a shape corresponding to the lower plate 120 and<br>
then a press in which the die set is installed is operated to<br>
make the lower plate 120, Herein, the elevated portion 300 .<br>
can be formed on trie lower plate 120 by adding a shape<br>
corresponding to the elevated portion 300 to the die set.<br>
Further, the front and rear elevated portions 301 and<br>
302	may be made in a separate process, and then may be fixed<br>
on the lower plate 120. Preferably, a metal plate may be<br>
used to make the separate elevated portions 301 and 302.<br>
However, it is possible to make the separate elevated portion<br>
301 and 302 with synthetic resin. <br>
 When the elevated portions 301 and 302 are made by a<br>
separate process, the metal elevated portions 301 and 302 may<br>
easily be fixed on the lower plate 120 by welding and the<br>
synthetic resin elevated portions 301 and 302 may easily be<br>
fixed on the lower plate 120 by using adhesive. Other way of,<br>
fixing the separate elevated portions 301 and 302 on the<br>
lower plate 120 is possible, for example, a way of forming a<br>
groove on the 120 and a corresponding protrusion on the<br>
elevated portions 301 and 302.<br>
A ceramic plate, on which food is to be loaded, may be<br>
positioned above the stirrer fan 200 {not shown). <br>
The microwave distributing operation of the stirrer fan<br>
200 and the front and rear elevated portions 301 and 302 will<br>
be described.<br><br>
The magnetron 33 generates a microwave and radiates it<br>
to the waveguide. The waveguide guides the microwave to the<br>
lower side of the cavity where the stirrer fan 200 is<br>
located. The rotating fan 210 of the stirrer fan 200<br>
receives the microwave, and distributes the microwave at its<br>
outer end toward the cavity 20 in a radial direction when the<br>
motor 240 rotates the rotating fan 210.<br>
The radially distributed microwave collides with the<br>
front and rear elevated portions 301 that are formed around<br>
the "outside of the rotating fan 210, and the collided<br>
microwave is scattered in all directions, such that the food<br>
can be exposed to the microwave evenly and thereby be cooked<br>
evenly.<br>
That is, the elevated portion 300 allows the microwave<br>
to be uniformly distributed about the cavity 20.<br>
As describe above, the uniform distribution of the<br>
microwave is attained by employing two structures, i.e., the<br>
elevated portion 300 at the lower side of the cavity 20 and<br>
the convergence preventing part 14 0 at the upper side of the<br>
cavity 20. Herein, the lower side and upper side of the<br>
cavity 20 may be provided with any one of the two structures<br>
or both the two structures, for example, the lower side with<br>
the convergence preventing part 140 and the upper side of the<br>
cavity 20 with elevated portion 300.<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that<br>
various modifications and variations can be made in the<br>
present invention. Thus, it is intended that the present<br>
invention covers the modifications and variations of this<br>
invention provided they come within the scope of the appended<br>
claims and their equivalents.<br>
