Cross-Reference to Related Applications<br>
This is a non-provisional application of U.S. Provisional Application Serial No.<br>
60/615,989 filed October 5,2004.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present system relates to encoding video data and, more particularly,<br>
providing a mechanism for identifying and processing data within a data stream.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A multimedia data stream is a stream of encoded video data able to be<br>
transmitted for receipt by a player application, typically a media player application.<br>
Prior to transmission of the multimedia data stream, the data stream is partitioned into a<br>
plurality of packets containing data representing a portion of a frame of the encoded<br>
video data. Both the stream itself and each respective packet of the stream includes a<br>
header that provides information representing stream syntax to the receiving system<br>
about the stream and/or packet being received. Existing systems encode this<br>
information in at least one of a text and binary format. However, these formats are<br>
problematic in that they are not easily upgradeable and require the player to be hard<br>
coded with a set of instructions able to decode the stream in the encoded format. Thus,<br>
the stream flexibility is reduced because stream proxies used to decode the data stream<br>
must be updated to handle any altered stream syntax or else are subject to failure.<br>
Markup Languages are widely used languages that provide a way of depicting<br>
the logical structure or semantics associated with an element of data and provide<br>
instructions to a system on how to at least one of handle, process and display the<br>
received data stream. Examples of markup languages are Hypertext markup language<br>
(HTML), extensible Markup Language (XML) and Standard General Markup<br>
Language (SGML). Markup languages provide a mechanism for annotating data or a<br>
collection of digital data in order to indicate the structure of the document or datafile<br>
and the contents of its data elements. These languages are readily expandable.<br>
However, they are generally associated with a stream of data and not formed integral<br>
therewith.<br>
A system according to invention principles address these deficiencies and<br>
associated problems.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A system and method for encoding a video data stream. A determinator<br>
determines attributes associated with the video data'stream. An encoder receives the<br>
attributes from the first determinator and encodes a stream header identifying stream<br>
syntax, the stream header being encoded in a markup language. A multiplexer<br>
combines the encoded stream headers with the video data stream.<br>
A system for decoding an encoded video data stream. A parser analyzes the<br>
received data stream and stream headers to determining the existence of markup tags<br>
identifying attributes of the received data stream and frames of the data stream. A<br>
decoder decodes the received data streams and markup tags. A display generator<br>
generates a display of the decoded video data stream in response to identified attributes<br>
of the received data stream.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
An application as used herein is an executable computer program or set of<br>
instructions comprising code or machine readable instruction for implementing<br>
predetermined functions including those of an operating system, healthcare information<br>
system or other information processing system, for example, in response user command<br>
or input. An executable procedure is a segment of code (machine readable instruction),<br>
sub-routine, or other distinct section of code or portion of an executable application for<br>
performing one or more particular processes and may include performing operations on<br>
received input parameters (or in response to received input parameters) and provide<br>
resulting output parameters. A processor as used herein is a device and/or set of<br>
machine-readable instructions for performing tasks. A processor comprises any one or<br>
combination of, hardware, firmware, and/or software. A processor acts upon<br>
information by manipulating, analyzing, modifying, converting or transmitting<br>
information for use by an executable procedure or an information device, and/or by<br>
routing the information to an output device. A processor may use or comprise the<br>
capabilities of a controller or microprocessor, for example. Multimedia content or<br>
content stream as used herein is any encoded or un-encoded data having at least one of<br>
video data and audio data. A frame as used herein represents an atomic unit of<br>
application data and a frame group refers to a group of frames.<br>
Multimedia data steams may be encoded and compressed using a plurality of<br>
different types of encoding schemes. The choice of encoding schemes vary depending<br>
upon the application that will be receiving and processing the video data. The system<br>
includes a multimedia data stream that is encoded using a proprietary encoding format<br>
whereby the video data stream is partitioned into respective groups of frames wherein<br>
each respective group of frames is formed from a plurality of individual video frames.<br>
The structure of the groups of frames and the frames that form the group are<br>
determined based on the coding scheme used. This data stream, as used herein, will be<br>
known as the system stream and an exemplary system stream 20 is shown in Figure 1.<br>
Each system stream 20 includes a stream header 22 and a plurality of groups of<br>
frames 26, 28. The stream header 22 is encoded using a markup language such as<br>
XML. The stream header 22 is a markup language encoded document that describes at<br>
least one stream attribute associated with the data stream in which it is embedded.<br>
Each respective stream attribute described in the stream header 22 is denoted by a<br>
markup language tag that at least one of identifies data representing the respective<br>
attribute and provides instruction on processing the data representing the respective<br>
attribute. These stream attributes collectively define the stream syntax which is<br>
readable by a media player application and is needed to provide instructions to the<br>
media player application as to how to process the received stream data. For example,<br>
the stream header is able to provide information to initialize the correct decoders for<br>
decoding the received data stream. Without the proper instructions or if a data stream<br>
includes a header that is not readable by the media application, the media player<br>
application will fail and the data stream will not be decoded. Therefore, the media<br>
player application must be provided with a set of instructions regarding how each<br>
markup language tag will be handled.<br>
Using markup language to encode stream attribute data is advantageous.<br>
Markup languages are easily expandable to incorporate new features and functions<br>
with respect to the data which it denotes. Any desired stream attribute can be encoded<br>
within the stream header 22. This aids in future expansion and deployment of data<br>
stream formats. Additionally, a system stream that provides stream syntax in XML<br>
will allow any media player application to receive and decode the information denoted<br>
by known tags and ignore the information denoted by unknown tags. Thus, the media<br>
player application will not fail when attempting to decode a stream that has unknown<br>
instructional information associated therewith. Stream attributes include but are not<br>
limited to height, width, bit rate, frame rate, stream size and stream duration.<br>
The data stream shown in Figure 1 includes two frame groups, a first frame<br>
group 26 and a second frame group 28. Each respective frame group 26,28 includes a<br>
plurality of individual frames. The first frame group 26 includes three frames 26A,<br>
26B, 26C and the second frame group 28 includes two frames 28A, 28B. The stream<br>
shown herein is for purposes of example only and the data stream 20 can include any<br>
number of frame groups formed from any number of individual frames as determined<br>
by the coding scheme used to encode the data stream 20. Each respective frame group<br>
has at least one frame group attribute associated therewith. The system stream 20<br>
provides for a plurality of segment headers 24, each segment header 24 being<br>
positioned immediately preceding the first individual frame of a respective frame<br>
group. Similarly to the stream header 22, the segment header 24 is a markup language<br>
encoded document that includes information corresponding to the at least one stream<br>
attribute. Frame group attributes include but are not limited to type of frame group,<br>
i.e. group of key (I) frames or group of delta (P) frames, group length and group<br>
sequence number.<br>
The stream header 22 and the segment headers 24 denote attribute information.<br>
These headers 22, 24 are not equivalent to individual packet or datagram headers<br>
which include information regarding the framing and sequencing of the respective<br>
packet or datagram. In contrast, the stream header 22 and packet header 24 are<br>
embedded within the data stream 20 separate from the packets or datagrams and<br>
provide information to a media player application instructing the application how to<br>
process and use the data stream.<br>
Attributes of each of the data stream and the frame group are passed through an<br>
application interface along with the frame data. The XML encoder analyzes the<br>
attributes and detects changes in these attributes. Upon detecting the change in the<br>
attributes, the encoder encodes either a stream header 22 or a segment header 24 and<br>
inserts an respective markup language tag when the pertinent change is detected.<br>
Some attributes of the stream are indirectly specified by the operator. For instance if<br>
the operator specifies that the video is to be encoded at 320x240 pixels these<br>
parameters will be encoded into the stream header. Any upgrade to the stream syntax<br>
will appear as a new tag within the header.<br>
Figure 2 is an exemplary stream header 22. The format for each of the stream<br>
header 22 and the segment header 24 is the same and is directly dependent upon the<br>
number of attributes to be described within the respective header 22, 24 for describing<br>
either the data stream or group of frames associated therewith. The stream header 22<br>
includes an opening field 12 including markup language tags that identify the<br>
document being encoded as the header. The stream header 22 further includes a<br>
plurality of attribute fields 14 each having information corresponding an attribute<br>
describing the data stream in which the header embedded. A first attribute field 14A<br>
includes a first markup language tag denoting data representing a first attribute. Each<br>
of the second attribute field 14B, third attribute field 14C and fourth attribute field<br>
14D include markup language tags denoting data representing additional attributes of<br>
the data stream 20 as shown in Figure 1. The stream header 22 includes a close field<br>
16 which includes a markup language tag denoting that the header 22 is closed and no<br>
additional information is present.<br>
Figure 3 is a block diagram of the encoder of the system. A source video data<br>
30 encoded using a predetermined coding scheme is provided. The encoded video<br>
data is provided to each of a first determinator 34, a second determinator 36 and a<br>
multiplexer 42. The first determinator 34 examines the encoded data stream and<br>
determines attributes associated with the video data stream and provides the<br>
determined attributes to a first header encoder 38. The first header encoder 38 encodes<br>
a stream header setting forth stream syntax in response to the determined stream<br>
attributes using a markup language. The second determinator 36 analyzes the groups<br>
of frames that form the data stream and determines attributes associated with each<br>
respective frame group within the data stream. The determined frame group attributes<br>
are provided to a second header encoder 40 for encoding a frame group header setting<br>
for the frame group syntax in response to the determined frame group attributes using<br>
a markup language. The first header encoder 38 and the second header encoder 40<br>
provide the encoded stream and frame group headers to the multiplexer 42 which<br>
combines the headers with the video data stream. The multiplexed video data stream<br>
is provided to a partitioner 44 for partitioning of the data stream into transportable<br>
packets. The transportable packets are provided to a broadcaster 46 for broadcasting<br>
packets 48 thereof.<br>
Figure 4 is a flowchart detailing the encoding operation performed by the<br>
system In step S400, a video data stream is provided to a determinator. At the<br>
determinator, attributes representing the provided data stream are determined as in step<br>
S402. An encoder encodes a stream header in response to the determined stream<br>
attributes in step S404. Step S4Q4 is performed using a markup language such as<br>
XML. The stream header encoded in step S404 includes a plurality of attribute fields,<br>
the number of which is directly related to the number of determined stream attributes<br>
from step S402. A further determination is made from the video data stream regarding<br>
the existence of frame groups within the data stream. If not, then the method proceeds<br>
to step S412 which will be discussed below. If there are frame groups within the<br>
frame, then a second determinator determines attributes associated with each<br>
respective frame group within the stream in step S408. In response to the<br>
determination in step S408, a segment header for each respective group of frames is<br>
encoded in step S410. Similar to the stream header, the segment header includes a<br>
includes a plurality of attribute fields, the number of which is directly related to the<br>
number of determined frame group attributes from step S408. IN step S412, the video<br>
data stream is combined with each of the stream header and the respective segment<br>
headers to be processed and transmitted for receipt by a media player application such<br>
as will be discussed in Figures 5 and 6. During the combination step S412, the stream<br>
header is inserted prior to any of the respective frame groups and each segment header<br>
is inserted immediately prior to the respective group of frame associated therewith.<br>
Figure 5 is a block diagram of a media player application 50 for receiving a<br>
plurality of packets 48. The media player application 50 includes a receiver 52, a<br>
compiler, a parser 54, a first decoder 56, a second decoder 58, a tag table 55 and a<br>
display generator 60. The receiver 52 receives the source of packets 48 which is<br>
broadcast by the broadcaster shown in Figure 3. The compiler 53 complies the<br>
received packets to form a data stream including the plurality of frames. The transport<br>
layer treats stream header and each respective segment header as a separate frame prior<br>
to decoding. The parser 54 parses the received data stream and analyzes at least one of<br>
the stream header and the segment header. This analysis determines the existence of<br>
markup tags identifying respective stream attributes and frame group attributes. The<br>
value of each tag is stored in the tag table 55. The values in the tag table 55 are<br>
presented to each of the decoders 56, 58. The decoders review tags within the headers<br>
and look at entries in the table to determine if the tag contains instructions to initiate a<br>
function performed by the decoders 56, 58. Upon determining the attributes<br>
associated with at least one of the data stream or a respective frame group within the<br>
stream, any of the first decoder 58 and second decoder 56 initiated for decoding the<br>
received data stream. The decoded stream is provided to the display generator 60 for<br>
generating a display outputting the data stream via the media player application. The<br>
display generator 60 may also be in communication with the parser 54 and operate in<br>
response to a data associated with a respective markup tag within the stream header or<br>
segment header.<br>
Figure 6 is a flow diagram detailing the operation of the media player<br>
application shown in Figure 5. The media player application receives, via a receiver, a<br>
plurality of packets that form an encoded data stream in step S600. In step 8602, the<br>
data stream is parsed and the each of the stream header and the respective segment<br>
headers are analyzed. In step S604, the parser determines the existence of any markup<br>
tags that identify attributes of the entire data stream and provides instructions to any<br>
respective components regarding how the data stream is to be decoded in response to<br>
the markup tags found in step S606. A determination is made in step S608 whether or<br>
not the data stream includes any frame groups. If not, then the process continues at<br>
step S614 discussed below. If the data stream includes frame groups, then the parser<br>
analyzes the segment headers for any markup tags representing frame group attributes<br>
associated with the respect frame group. Instructions from the segment headers are<br>
provided to components for decoding the frame groups of the data stream using the<br>
markup tags located in step S610. hi response to the decoding of the stream and the<br>
respective frame groups, the decoded stream is provided to a display generator for<br>
generating a display of the decoded stream using the media player application.<br>
Upgrades to stream version formats are transparent and easily accomplished<br>
because there need not be any major deployment of new stream decoding parameters<br>
to a plurality of media player applications. The markup language allows the existing<br>
media players to decode new stream versions because the media player applications<br>
will just analyze and make use of the markup language tags with which it familiar.<br>
Thus, additional types of data such as annotations, synchronized media event data or<br>
any other attribute may be selectively added to the stream syntax without disabling<br>
previously deployed components.<br>
