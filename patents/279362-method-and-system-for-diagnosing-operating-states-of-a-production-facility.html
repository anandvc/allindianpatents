Description<br>
Method and System for Diagnosing Operating States of a Production Facility<br>
Technical Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method and a system for diagnosing<br>
operating states, especially the suitability of a pressure profile of a production<br>
facility such as a molding machine or a pressing machine.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
As a preliminary step toward diagnosing the operating states of a molding<br>
machine, well known is a method for monitoring the operating states by<br>
collecting the data to be monitored that relates to operating conditions when<br>
the molding machine is in operation. For instance, conventional monitoring<br>
systems for a molding machine to carry out such a method are disclosed in<br>
Japanese Patent Early-Publications Nos.2001-293540 and 2002-263793.<br>
Respective systems transmit data that is actually measured by sensors<br>
disposed in the molding machine when it is in operation to a monitoring unit in<br>
a remote place through a communication line. The monitoring unit displays<br>
the data on its display. The data to be monitored is data concerning an air<br>
pressure profile and processing times in one cycle of the molding process of the<br>
molding machine. The measured data is stored in a computer with a CSV<br>
(Comma Separated Value) file for every cycle.<br>
In the conventional monitoring systems, however, the diagnosing<br>
suitability of operating states (whether or not the measured data is within the<br>
tolerance) of the molding machine relies on human judgment. Therefore, an<br>
inspector must repeatedly inspect the measured data of one of a plurality of<br>
CSV files from a monitor output or a printed output of a computer, and compare<br>
 <br>
this separately with reference data or optimum data (typically, it is collected<br>
when the molding machine is in a trial operation and set up) based on the<br>
inspector's judgment. Among other things, the data on the pressure profile<br>
involves a difficulty in appropriately diagnosing it by comparing the measured<br>
data with the reference data, unless the inspector is experienced and skilled in<br>
pressure profile diagnoses. Further, it is extremely difficult to make a<br>
diagnosis, considering the varying parameters of each product to be molded,<br>
such as preset pressure conditions, pressurization time, etc.<br>
In practice, it is very difficult by a manual operation and by an inspector's<br>
judgment to repeat a diagnosis without omitting necessary data from a huge<br>
number of files, and to avoid variations due to an inspector's skill.<br>
Accordingly, developing a method and a system for automatically<br>
diagnosing operating states of a molding machine is considered essential for its<br>
efficient operation.<br>
The need for such a method and a system is not limited to the molding<br>
machine, and exists, e.g., in a pressing machine that performs a pressing<br>
operation based on the preset pressure profile.<br>
The Summary of the Invention<br>
One object of the present invention is to provide a diagnostic system for<br>
diagnosing operating conditions of a production facility in which pressure is<br>
controlled based on a preset pressure profile that can be set according to each<br>
product to be made therefrom.<br>
In one aspect of the present invention, the diagnostic system comprises a<br>
measurement system that includes at least a sensor for measuring an actual<br>
pressure profile corresponding to the preset pressure profile when the<br>
production facility is operated; storing means for storing a reference pressure<br>
profile that is selected according to the product to be made by the production<br>
facility and the actual pressure profile to form a database of the pressure<br>
 <br>
profiles.' comparing means for comparing the reference pressure profile to the<br>
actual pressure profile in the database of the pressure profiles; and<br>
determining means for determining whether the actual pressure profile is<br>
within a predetermined tolerance based on the result from the comparing<br>
means.<br>
The reference pressure profile may be acquired for one or more kinds of<br>
products to be made from the production facility under operating conditions<br>
that are considered to be the optimum.<br>
Preferably, the preset pressure profile is variable, and the system further<br>
includes updating means for updating the reference pressure profile following<br>
the variations in the preset pressure profile. In this case, the updating means<br>
assumes a new reference pressure profile by multiplying the reference pressure<br>
profile before being updated with a predetermined coefficient.<br>
The diagnostic system may further include one or more output means to<br>
output data on the result that is determined. The output means may visually<br>
display an actual pressure profile that deviates from the tolerance and the<br>
relevant data.<br>
If the production facility has one or more processing times to be diagnosed,<br>
the measurement system may further include means for measuring the<br>
processing time to be diagnosed when the production facility is operated. In this<br>
case, the storing means stores a reference processing time that is previously<br>
established and the measured processing time to form a database of the<br>
processing times. The comparing means further compares the reference<br>
processing time with the measured processing time in the database of the<br>
processing times. The determining means further determines whether the<br>
measured processing time is within a predetermined tolerance, based on the<br>
result from the comparing means. Further, the determining means may be<br>
adapted to selectively switch between the determination of the pressure profile<br>
and the determination of the processing time.<br>
The diagnostic system may further include display means for visually<br>
 <br>
displaying the result that is determined for the processing time. The result<br>
that is displayed on the display means is preferably separated by color,<br>
depending on any deviation from the reference processing time to the measured<br>
processing time. The determining means may statistically process the data in<br>
the database for each processing time to be diagnosed, to calculate the<br>
maximum value, the minimum value, and the mean value, in the database, and<br>
then displays them on the display means.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention provides a method for diagnosing an<br>
actual pressure profile of a production facility in which pressure is controlled<br>
based on a preset pressure profile. The method comprises forming a database of<br>
a reference pressure profile that is selected according to the product to be made<br>
at the production facility and an actual pressure profile; and comparing the<br>
reference pressure profile to the actual pressure profile in the database of the<br>
pressure profiles, and determining whether the actual pressure profile is<br>
within a predetermined tolerance.<br>
The method preferably further comprises forming a database of a reference<br>
processing time that is previously established and the actual measured<br>
processing time; and comparing the reference processing time to the measured<br>
processing time in the database of the processing times, and determining<br>
whether the measured processing time is within a predetermined tolerance<br>
based on the result of the comparison.<br>
In the diagnostic system and the method of the present invention, the preset<br>
pressure profile is defined by a set value of a target pressure and a set value at<br>
a pressurization time.<br>
In the diagnostic system and the method of the present invention, the<br>
production facility may be a molding machine or a pressing machine.<br>
Yet another aspect of the present invention provides a method for diagnosing<br>
an operating state of a molding machine, aided by a computer. The molding<br>
machine controls pressure based on a preset pressure profile that can be set<br>
according to each mold to be made therefrom. The method comprises providing<br>
 <br>
a reference pressure profile that is selected in accord with a mold to be made by<br>
the molding machine and an actual pressure profile that is actually measured<br>
when the molding machine is operated to the computer to form a database of<br>
the pressure profiles; and comparing the reference pressure profile to the actual<br>
pressure profile in the database of the pressure profiles by the computer to<br>
determine whether the actual pressure profile is within a predetermined<br>
tolerance.<br>
The method preferably further comprises providing a reference processing<br>
time that is previously established for the molding machine and an actual<br>
measured processing time of the molding machine to the computer to form a<br>
database of the processing times! and comparing the reference processing time<br>
to the measured processing time in the database of the processing times by the<br>
computer to determine whether the measured processing time is within a<br>
predetermined tolerance based on the result of the comparison.<br>

The Preferred Embodiment of the Present Invention<br>
Fig. 1A shows a diagnostic system A of one embodiment of the present<br>
invention. The system may be applied to a diagnosis of a productive facility. In<br>
the embodiment, the system A is configured to diagnose operating states of a<br>
flaskless molding machine M, as one example. An operating panel 1 can set a<br>
target pressure and a pressurization time.<br>
The operating panel 1 is equipped with operating switches that include one<br>
such as an ON—OFF switch necessary for operating the molding machine M.<br>
Further, a controller (not shown), which controls the sequence of the molding<br>
machine M, is mounted on a control board 2. The control board 2 is detachably<br>
connected to the diagnostic system A.<br>
A measurement system 3, which measures the operating states of the<br>
molding machine M, includes pressure sensors (not shown) that measure the<br>
pressures of squeezing, an oil pump, aerations, and encoders (not shown) that<br>
measure the positions of cope and drag flasks.<br>
The measurement system 3 directly provides signals of the<br>
measurements to the control board 2 such that the operating states, e.g., in a<br>
molding process, of the molding machine M, are monitored similarly to the<br>
prior art.<br>
The control board 2 stores software involving a sequence control program<br>
of the molding machine M. The software is configured to issue operating<br>
commands to operate the molding machine M in line with the program based on<br>
the signals output from the measurement system 3. To this end, the control<br>
board 2 can be configured from, but it is not limited to, a programmable logic<br>
 <br>
controller (PLC), for instance.<br>
As shown in Fig.1B, the diagnostic system A includes a memory 11 that<br>
stores reference data, and measured data that is measured every cycle in an<br>
actual molding operation of the molding machine M for the specified data<br>
among data associated with the operation of the molding machine M, such as to<br>
form a database 13, and a CPU board 15 for analyzing the database 13. The<br>
CPU board 15 is composed of a CPU and peripheral circuitry such that it is<br>
configured to compare the reference data and the measured data in the<br>
database 13 by the program stored in the memory 11, to diagnose the operating<br>
states of the molding machine M based on the result of the comparison. The<br>
memory 11, the database 13, and the CPU board 15, may be configured from,<br>
but are not limited to, a personal computer that has a display 17 in which the<br>
reference data and the measured data are displayed in contrast, as an output<br>
device, and an input device 19 such as a keyboard and a mouse. The display 17<br>
may be a touch screen such that it functions as an input device 19. The output<br>
device may include a printer to output a hard copy of the data, or a plotter.<br>
The preset data that defines the operating conditions of the molding<br>
machine M includes a preset value of the target pressure (preset value of the<br>
pressure) and the pressurization time (command of the pressurization time),<br>
which both define the pressure profile, and a processing time, positional data,<br>
etc.<br>
The pressure profile is of pressure profile in a sand tank. It is one of the<br>
major factors for determining the suitability of the molding process.<br>
The operating conditions involving significant influences on the molding<br>
process in the molding machine M include the processing time, as well as the<br>
pressure profile. It is thus also desirable to diagnosis the processing time of not<br>
only the pressure profile in the molding machine M. The processing time to be<br>
diagnosed in the molding machine M involves items with high potentials to<br>
cause trouble when the molding machine M is in operation. For instance, they<br>
include, but are not limited to, the rotation time of a turntable, required times<br>
 <br>
for a shuttle that carries a pattern forward and backward, required times for<br>
normal and reverse rotations of the cope flask and the drag flask when they are<br>
rotated, a required time for presetting the cope flask and the drag flask, a draw<br>
time, required times for the forward and backward movement for pushing out a<br>
mold, and the required times for overlapping, stripping, and separating the<br>
cope flask and the drag flask.<br>
The reference data is ideal data that is a criterion for a comparative<br>
determination to diagnose the operating conditions. For instance, it may use<br>
measured data under the optimum operating conditions for the molding process<br>
of the molding machine in a trial operation and set up immediately after the<br>
molding machine is installed.<br>
It is desirable to store and register optimum data that has been confirmed<br>
when a specific mold is made as the optimum operating conditions and the<br>
reference data in the database 13, since the data on operating conditions, the<br>
pressure profile, and the processing time of the molding machine M vary, based<br>
on each mold of an article to be molded. Because different molds are to be<br>
made, namely, the shapes of patterns are different, the number of the<br>
corresponding pattern can be assigned as an identifier of the optimum<br>
operating conditions and the reference data of each mold. For instance, n<br>
kinds of molds to be made are identified by assigning numbers of the<br>
corresponding patterns as pattern 1, pattern 2, ..., pattern n-1, and pattern n.<br>
The diagnosis may be carried out for each pattern. Thus each mold is to be<br>
made by selecting the pattern number.<br>
It is desirable to provide a means for selecting the data that one wishes<br>
to diagnose, if the data to be diagnosed contains a plurality of data (e.g., both<br>
the pressure profile and the processing time, or a plurality of processing times<br>
to be diagnosed, exists). To this end, it is possible to make a program such<br>
that the predetermined data may be selected by operating a cursor on the<br>
display 17 of the computer using the input device 19, e.g., the mouse, and the<br>
CPU board 15 may diagnose the operating conditions corresponding to the<br>
 <br>
selected data.<br>
The data of the pressure profile and the processing time are stored in a file,<br>
e.g., a CSV file, a TXT file (tab delimitate), or a PRN files (space delimited). The<br>
file is stored in the database 13 by replacing it with an area file of the database<br>
13. The CPU board 15 compares the reference data and the measured data.<br>
Both together make the database such that the operating conditions can be<br>
automatically diagnosed.<br>
In the molding machine M, the pressure profile involves a predetermined<br>
final pressure value P and a pressurization time T as shown in Fig. 2(a), even if<br>
a set value of the target pressure and a set value of the pressurization time T of<br>
the optimum operating conditions are set to operate the molding machine.<br>
This pressure profile is assumed to be the same one as the reference data (the<br>
reference pressure profile).<br>
To optimize the molding process, however, the preset pressure profile is<br>
typically intended to be changed during the operation. Namely, the set<br>
values of the target pressure and the pressurization time, both defining the<br>
preset pressure profile, are varied while the molding machine M is in operation.<br>
For example, the set value of the target pressure is typically manually changed<br>
by an operator based on, e.g., properties characteristic of kneading sand, even<br>
in a molding process to make the same molds. For instance, a pressure profile<br>
in which the target pressure value P1 is lower than a reference target pressure<br>
value P, as shown in Fig. 2(b), is obtained when the set value of the target<br>
pressure is lowered below its reference set. Similarly, the pressurization time<br>
T is automatically varied by means of the controller of the control board 2 to<br>
perform an optimum molding operation of the molding machine. For instance,<br>
a pressure profile in which a pressurization time T1 is longer than a reference<br>
pressurization time T, as shown in Fig. 2(c), is obtained when a set value at the<br>
pressurization time is lengthened by more than the reference pressurization<br>
time.<br>
Therefore, the reliabitity of the results of the diagnosis depends greatly on<br>
 <br>
the set value of the reference pressure profile that is the criteria for a diagnosis<br>
when the actual pressure profile is diagnosed. Therefore, it is desirable to<br>
provide a new reference pressure profile if the pressure profile that is actually<br>
set in the operating conditions differs from the reference pressure profile. In<br>
this embodiment, a new reference pressure profile is thus presumed by<br>
converting the reference pressure profile in the optimum operating conditions<br>
in line with the operating conditions that correspond to the actual pressure<br>
profile.<br>
The assumption of the new reference pressure profile is now explained in<br>
more detail. The preset pressure profile and the set value of the target<br>
pressure in the operating condition in the molding process are preserved and<br>
registered in the database 13. Further, the set value of the pressure profile is<br>
compared to the set value of the target pressure profile in the operating<br>
condition that corresponds to the measured value of the pressure profile, to<br>
derive a predetermined pressure coefficient. This coefficient is then<br>
multiplied by a reference set value of the pressure profile. Consequently, the<br>
pressure profile of the operating conditions is quantitatively processed to<br>
assume a reference pressure profile as diagnostic criteria. This assumed<br>
reference value, namely the new reference value is used — in diagnosing<br>
pressure profile that is subsequently measured. Even in the following<br>
operating conditions, a process that assumes a new reference pressure profile<br>
and that uses the presumed and reference value for the diagnosis is repeated.<br>
The pressurization time is preserved and registered in the database as a<br>
signal corresponding to the pressurization time. The set value at the<br>
pressurization time in the operating condition that corresponds to the<br>
measured value of the pressure profile is preserved and registered in the<br>
database. Further, the set value of the pressure profile is compared to the set<br>
value at the pressurization time in the operating condition that corresponds to<br>
the measured value of the pressure profile, to derive a predetermined<br>
pressurization time coefficient. This coefficient is then multiplied by a<br>
 <br>
reference set value of the pressure profile. Consequently, the pressure profile<br>
of the operating conditions is quantitatively processed to assume a reference<br>
pressure profile as diagnostic criteria. This assumed reference value, namely,<br>
the new reference value, is used in diagnosing the pressure profile that is<br>
subsequently measured. Even in the following operating conditions, a process<br>
that assumes a new reference pressure profile and that uses the presumed and<br>
reference value for the diagnosis is repeated.<br>
With this assumed method, an excellent diagnosis of the pressure<br>
profile can be performed efficiently and optimally by assuming a new reference<br>
pressure profile to consider the set values of the target pressure profile and the<br>
pressurization time and by using this assumed and reference value for the<br>
diagnosis, rather than when the reference pressure profile in the optimum<br>
operation is used as an absolute fixed value.<br>
Further, it is desirable to visually display data of the pressure profile that<br>
deviates from the tolerance as a result of the diagnosis of the pressure profile.<br>
To this end, the operating conditions and the operation data, for example, can<br>
be outputted to enable the review of details of that data and to plot a graph or<br>
graphs by using spreadsheet software, graph-making software, numerical<br>
analysis software, etc. It causes any data that deviates from the tolerance to<br>
be identified. Or overwriting the characteristic and the graph of other air<br>
pressure data on it enables the relationship between them to be checked. In<br>
this embodiment, one example of the spreadsheet software might be the<br>
EXCEL application, available from MICROSOFT Corporation.<br>
Although the procedure for diagnosis in this embodiment will be described<br>
below, the present invention is not limited to such a procedure.<br>
As in Fig. 3, the reference pressure profile and the reference processing time<br>
as reference data are registered in the database 13 of the diagnostic system A<br>
before the diagnosis begins. As described above, this reference pressure<br>
profile and the reference processing time are data captured when the molding<br>
machine M is in the startup operation and the trial operation, and correspond<br>
 <br>
to when the pressure profile and the processing time in an ideal state of the<br>
operation of the molding machine M were preserved. It may be configured such<br>
that the registration of the pressure profile and the processing time is carried<br>
out from the CSV file for each individual different mold (corresponding to the<br>
pattern number, as described above).<br>
The measurement system 3 then puts the actual pressure profile and the<br>
measured processing time in the database 13 through the control board 2(step<br>
Si). Such a data acquisition is taken by specifying the CSV file for which the<br>
data acquisition has been carried out when the molding machine M is in the<br>
molding operation. The manufactured mold (the pattern number) is specified so<br>
as to execute the diagnosis for each pattern number.<br>
Either the pressure profile or the processing time to be diagnosed is selected<br>
(step S2). In this step, if the pressure profile is selected, the step proceeds to<br>
step S3, and if the processing time is selected, the step proceeds to step 7.<br>
(1) Diagnosis of the Pressure Profile<br>
The diagnosis screen of the pressure profile is displayed on the display 17<br>
of the diagnostic system A (step S3). The upper and lower limits of tolerance<br>
from the reference pressure profile are then entered in the diagnostic system A<br>
as thresholds (step S4). These steps 3 and 4 may be executed by the inspector<br>
to operate the input device 19. The CPU board 15 begins the diagnosis to<br>
compare the reference pressure profile to the actual pressure profile, and to<br>
further compare the result to the thresholds. When this diagnosis is executed,<br>
the reference pressure profile and the actual pressure profile may in turn be<br>
drawn on the display 17 (step S5). The diagnostic system A may be configured<br>
such that the diagnostic results are displayed on the display 17 by instructions<br>
from the CPU board 15. For instance, it displays "OK" when the actual<br>
pressure profile is within the tolerance, and it displays "Limit Over" when<br>
deviating from the upper or lower threshold (step S6). In the latter case, the<br>
CPU board 15 records the actual pressure profile that corresponds to "Limit<br>
 <br>
Over" on, e.g., the history list in memory 11. The data in the history list may<br>
be selected to be sent to the data to the EXCEL application, available from<br>
MICROSOFT Corporation to graphically display it on the display 17.<br>
(2) Diagnosis of the Processing time<br>
In the diagnosis of the processing time, the reference processing time is<br>
compared to the actual measured processing time. If the results of the<br>
comparison are displayed such that they are separated by color based on their<br>
scores of any deviation, they may immediately bring about a visual evaluation<br>
by a person. Therefore, it is preferable to configure the CPU board 15 such<br>
that it determines whether the actual measured processing time is within the<br>
reference value and displays the results that are determined in separate colors<br>
on the display 17. It is also preferable that the CPU board 15 has a function for<br>
statistically processing the diagnostic results of the processing time to quickly<br>
calculate the maximum value, the minimum value, and the mean value, in the<br>
database. If there is a plurality of items to be diagnosed for the processing<br>
time, such a statistical processing is executed per item. Just the data that<br>
involves a significant effect on the maintenance of the facilities may be<br>
extracted from among an enormous quantity of data, to display it on the display<br>
17 in a view format.<br>
To execute the diagnosis of the processing time, the inspector operates the<br>
input device 19 to display a diagnostic screen for the processing time on the<br>
display 17 (step S7). The CPU board 15 compares the measured processing time<br>
to the reference processing time for each diagnostic item at each CSV file (step<br>
S8). The CPU board 15 displays the diagnostic results on the display 17 such<br>
that they are separated by their colors. For instance, if the deviation from the<br>
reference processing time to the measured processing time is within ±8%, it is<br>
displayed in green. If it is within ±10%, it is displayed in yellow, or if it deviates<br>
from the range by ±10, it is displayed in pink. The CPU board 15 statistically<br>
processes each diagnostic item to calculate the maximum time, the minimum<br>
 <br>
time, and the mean time. The total ratios of the data within 8%, and data<br>
within 10%, in the result of the diagnosis, are also displayed in percentages<br>
(step S9). Because the state of, e.g., the variation of the aging molding<br>
machine in each item diagnosed becomes known, it also aids in preventive<br>
maintenance.<br>
(3) Presumption of the Reference Pressure Profile and Diagnosis of the<br>
Pressure Profile<br>
With the diagnostic system A begins the pressure diagnostics, as shown in<br>
Fig.4, the CPU board 15 reads a set value before the reference pressure profile<br>
is updated (step S11). The CPU board 15 then reads a preset value of the target<br>
pressure of the pressure profile corresponding to the actual pressure profile<br>
(step S12). The CPU board 15 calculates pressure coefficient K1 to be<br>
multiplied by the reference pressure profile for this actual pressure profile (step<br>
S13). The CPU board 15 multiplies the pressure coefficient K1 by the reference<br>
pressure profile (step S14). The pressure coefficient K1 becomes "1 " if the set<br>
value of the target pressure in the reference pressure profile is the same as the<br>
set value of the target pressure in the actual pressure profile, i.e., there is no<br>
change in the former.<br>
The CPU board 15 then reads a set value at the pressurization time of the<br>
reference pressure profile and reads a set value at the pressurization time of<br>
the pressure profile corresponding to the actual pressure profile (steps S15 and<br>
S16). The CPU board 15 then calculates a pressurization time coefficient K2,<br>
which warps the reference pressure profile with the time axis. The CPU board<br>
15 multiplies the pressurization time coefficient K2 by the reference pressure<br>
profile, which in turn has been multiplied by the pressure coefficient K1, so as<br>
to estimate a new reference pressure profile (steps S17 and S18). The pressure<br>
pressurization time K2 becomes "1," if the set value of the pressurization time<br>
in the reference pressure profile is the same as the set value of the<br>
pressurization time in the actual pressure profile, i.e., there is no change in the<br>
 <br>
former.<br>
The upper and lower limits of the tolerance from the new reference<br>
pressure profile are then entered in the diagnostic system A as thresholds (step<br>
S19). This step 19 may be executed by the inspector to manually operate the<br>
input device 19 or may be automatically executed by a program that is installed<br>
in the CPU board 15. The CPU board 15 diagnoses the actual pressure profile<br>
by using the new reference pressure profile with the thresholds. If the actual<br>
pressure profile is within the tolerance, the CPU board 15 displays, e.g., the<br>
word "OK" on the display 17 and completes the diagnosis (steps S20 and S2l).<br>
If the actual pressure profile is not within the tolerance (i.e., it deviates from<br>
the upper or lower threshold), the CPU board 15 displays, e.g., the words "Limit<br>
Over" on the display 17, and records the corresponding actual pressure profile<br>
on the history list in the memory 11(step S22). Any data in the history list<br>
may be selected to be provided to the EXCEL application, available from the<br>
MICROSOFT Corporation (step S23), to graphically display the pressure<br>
profile on the display 17(step S24).<br>
Because this embodiment assumes the new reference pressure profile in<br>
consideration of the set value of the target pressure and the set value at the<br>
pressurization time of the pressure profile corresponding to the actual pressure<br>
profile, and uses this assumed reference pressure profile for the diagnosis, a<br>
highly accurate diagnosis of the pressure profile can be realized.<br>
In the embodiment, the diagnostic system of the present invention is<br>
applied to, but is not limited to, a molding machine, such as a tight-flask<br>
molding machine or a flaskless molding machine. However, the present<br>
invention can also be applied to facilities such as a pressing machine for<br>
pressing procedures in which pressure profiles are established based on preset<br>
pressures for respective products.<br>
The diagnostic system A of the present invention may optionally include a<br>
function to aid the confirmation of the safety conditions of the production<br>
facility by the operator when it is started up before the diagnosis of its<br>
 <br>
operating states begins. For instance, if the operating panel 1 that operates<br>
the production facility has a touch screen, one or more safety conditions to be<br>
confirmed and one or more selection keys may be displayed on this touch screen<br>
when the production facility is to start up. The operator then operates the<br>
selection keys that are matched to the corresponding safety conditions. If the<br>
production facility is the molding machine M, the safety conditions to be<br>
confirmed may include "Is piping definitely connected?" and "Is air, water, oil<br>
leaking from piping or hose?" After the operation of the selecting keys for the<br>
given safety conditions has been completed, the diagnostic system A determines<br>
whether the safety conditions at the production facility is in start up are<br>
confirmed. The diagnostic system A then switches the screen of the touch panel<br>
to a prescribed screen based on the result that is determined. If any trouble in<br>
the production facility is detected by the result that is determined, the<br>
production facility is started up after the detected trouble is resolved, to further<br>
improve the accuracy of the diagnosis. To confirm the safety conditions,<br>
utilized may be the control board 2 or the display 17 and the input device 19, all<br>
in place of the operating panel 1.<br>
Because the forgoing embodiments are just described for just illustrative<br>
purposes, rather than being intended to limit the present invention, those<br>
skilled in the art will recognize that many variations or modifications can be<br>
made within the sprit of the present invention, which is defined by the<br>
