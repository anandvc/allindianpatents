PROVISIONAL SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10 and Rule 13)<br>
"STABLE STATIN COMPOSITIONS"<br><br><br>
Inventia Healthcare Private Limited having its administrative office at Unit No. S - 4 , Khira  Industrial  Estate,  B.M Bhargava  Road,  Santacruz West,  Mumbai 400054,<br>
Maharashtra, India an Indian Company<br>
The following specification describes the invention.<br><br><br>
Field of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to stable oral pharmaceutical compositions comprising statin and process for preparation thereof.<br>
Background of the Invention:<br>
It is well known that statins such as lovastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, visastatin, atorvastatin, pravastatin, mevastatin, fluvastatin, rivastatin, cervastatin, pitavastatin nisvastatin, itavastatin, derivatives and analogs thereof are HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors used in the treatment of hyperlipidemia and /or hypercholesterolemia. However, these statins are unstable in acidic environment in which hydroxy acids moiety of statin undergoes degradation into a lactone. In addition to its susceptibility to low pH environment, these statins are also susceptible to heat, moisture and light. It undergoes rapid decomposition when exposed to UV or fluorescent light. Apart from the above mentioned environmental factors, excipients used in the pharmaceutical composition may also accelerate the degradation of statin. Therefore, these stains should not only be protected from the environmental factors but also should be protected from the potential excipients that cause degradation. By ensuring sufficient protection to statin, impurities in the compositions can be minimized, thereby reducing the side effects associated with such impurities, resulting in the improvement in the quality of treatment.<br>

Film coating material is selected from the group of cellulose derivatives such as hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, ethylcellulose; Eudragits RTM such as Eudragit EPO, polyvinyl alcohol, Opadry RTM, Opadry AMB RTM (aqueous moisture barrier), Aquacoat RTM, povidone, polyvinyl acetate, etc.<br>
Plasticizer is selected from the group of hydrophilic and / or hydrophobic plasticizers and is selected from polyethylene glycol, triacetin, triethylcitrate, acetyl triethylcitrate, miglyol, cetyl alcohol, acetyltributylcitrate, diethyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate, propylene glycol, hydrogenated oils, dibutylsebacate, meglumine and mixtures thereof and is preferably dibutyl sebacate. Plasticizers in the film coating layer is up to 30%, preferably from 5% to 20%, more preferably from 10% to 15% by weight of film forming layer.<br>
Any suitable natural, semi-synthetic, and synthetic colors, pigments, and flavors may be used. Preferred colors, pigments, and flavors are those that are listed in handbook of excipients.<br>
The invention is now described with non - limiting examples for the preparation of the composition comprising statin.<br>
Example 1: Atorvastatin Tablets 10mg<br>
Atorvastatin hemi calcium (amorphous form) (10.88 mg/tablet) was mixed with glycine (3.75 mg/tablet), lactose monohydrate (94.32 mg/tablet), microcrystalline cellulose PH 101 (25.0 mg/tablet), crospovidone (6.0 mg/tablet)  and  L-hydroxypropylcellulose  (3.0mg/tablet)  in  a  planetary<br>
17<br><br>
mixture for 10 minutes to obtain powder mixture. Butylated hydroxy anisole (0.15mg/tablet) and butylated hydroxy toluene (0.15mg/tablet) were dissolved in isopropanol. The solution was added to the powder mixture followed by addition of water under shear to obtain granules. The granules were dried in fluidized bed dryer at 55°C to 60°C. The dried granules were sieved through 30 mesh ASTM. Crospovidone (6.0 mg/tablet) was mixed with sieved granules in octagonal blender for 10 minutes followed by blending with magnesium stearate (2.25 mg/tablet) for 3 minutes. The resulting granules were compressed into tablets. The tablets were then coated with Opadry AMB (5.25 mg/tablet). The quantity in mg/tablet as given above can be adjusted accordingly to obtain the desired batch size. The tablets prepared above were packaged in induction sealed HDPE bottles with desiccants. These packed tablets were subjected to accelerated stability studies.<br>
Example 2: Atorvastatin Tablets 10mg<br>
Atorvastatin hemi calcium (crystalline form) (10.88 mg/tablet) was mixed with glycine (375 mg/tablet), lactose monohydrate (94.32 mg/tablet), microcrystalline cellulose PH 101 (25.0 mg/tablet), crospovidone (6.0 mg/tablet) and L-hydroxypropylcellulose (3.0mg/tablet) in a planetary mixture for 10 minutes to obtain powder mixture. Butylated hydroxy anisole (0.15 mg/tablet) and butylated hydroxy toluene (0.15mg/tablet) were dissolved in isopropanol. The solution was added to the powder mixture followed by addition of water under shear to obtain granules. The granules were dried in fluidized bed dryer at 55°C to 60°C. The dried granules were sieved through 30 mesh ASTM. Crospovidone (6.0 mg/tablet) was mixed with sieved granules in octagonal blender for 10 minutes followed by blending with magnesium stearate (2.25 mg/tablet) for 3 minutes. The resulting granules were compressed into tablets. The tablets were then coated with Opadry AMB (5.25 mg/tablet). The quantity in mg/tablet as given above can be adjusted accordingly to obtain the<br>
18<br><br>
desired batch size. The tablets prepared above were packaged in induction sealed HDPE bottles with desiccants. These packed tablets were subjected to accelerated stability studies at 40°C / 75% RH.<br>
The tablets prepared according to the above examples were subjected to dissolution testing in 0.5M phosphate buffer, pH 6.8 at 75 revolutions per minute using USP apparatus-ll. The results of the dissolution testing are provided in Table 1.<br>
