				<td>CERVICAL DILATION MONITOR<br>
FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a medical instrument and, in particular it<br>
concerns a cervical dilation monitor.<br>
5	By way of introduction, it is still standard practice for the obstetrician to resort to<br>
regular vaginal examination in order to estimate cervical dilation and thereby assess the progress of labor during the first stage of active labor. The cervix dilates to about 10 cm during this stage of labor as well as effacing to a very thin layer. However, these examinations are uncomfortable to the patient, inaccurate, objective, as well as risking 10 introducing infection into the uterus, these disadvantages being amplified if serial examinations are carried out by different observers.<br>
Of relevance to the present invention is U.S. Patent No.  5,658,295  to<br>
Krementsov which teaches an instrument, similar to calipers, with a scale for indicating<br>
dilation. The device taugjit by Krementsov is not designed to be left in position for<br>
15     continual monitoring. Additionally, the instrument is not disposable and requires<br>
repeated sterilization.<br>
Of most relevance to the present invention is U.S. Patent No. 4,141,345 to Allen et al. which teaches an expandable V-shaped caliper instrument. The dilation is measured using strain gauges. A shortcoming of the aforementioned system is that the 20     system is not disposable and requires repeated sterilization.<br>
Also of relevance to the present invention is U.S. Patent Nos. 4,476,871 to Hon<br>
and 6,423,000 to Berry. Both of these patents teach systems for monitoring cervical<br>
dilation. However, both of the systems are non-disposable, expensive as well as<br>
intrusive to the patient.<br>
25	There is therefore a need for a cheap, disposable cervical dilation monitor which<br>
is easy to fit and is comfortable and safe for the patient, takes into account cervical effacement, as well as providing accurate, continuous and objective measurements of cervical dilation.<br><br>
2 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

6 DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention is a cervical dilation monitor construction and method of operation thereof.<br>
The principles and operation of a cervical dilation monitor according to the 5     present invention may be better understood with reference to the drawings and the accompanying description.<br>
Reference is now made to Figs. 1 to 5. Fig. 1 is an isometric view of a cervical dilation monitor 10 that is constructed and operable in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention* Fig. 2 is a front view of cervical dilation monitor 10. Fig.<br>
10 3 is a top view of cervical dilation monitor 10. Fig. 4 is a front view of cervical dilation monitor 10 when fully extended. Fig. 5 is a top view of cervical dilation monitor 10 when fully extended. Cervical dilation monitor 10 includes an expandable gripping arrangement 12 having two oppositely facing gripping members 14 and an outwardly biased restoring member 16. Expandable gripping arrangement 12 is configured, such<br>
15 that, restoring member 16 pushes gripping members 14 apart so that expandable gripping arrangement 12 grips the cervix while the cervix dilates. Figs. 1,2 and 3 show cervical dilation monitor 10 in a contracted state, which is generally employed when fitting cervical dilation monitor 10 into a patient, as will be explained later with reference to Figs. 10 to 12. Figs. 4 and 5 show cervical dilation monitor 10 in a fully<br>
20 expanded state. Each gripping member 14 is configured to be expandable in order to grip a portion of the cervix even while the cervix effaces, as is best shown with reference to Figs. 13 to 15. Expandable gripping arrangement 12 includes two flexible connecting elements 18. Each flexible connecting element 18 uniquely mechanically connecting one of gripping members 14 to an end of restoring member 16. Flexible<br>
25 connecting elements 18 enable movement among gripping members 14 and restoring member 16, which is especially important having regard to the changes in the relative position of the dilating cervix, which is gradually moving upward, and gripping members 14.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 6, which is a cross-sectional view through the line<br>
30     A-A of Fig. 2. Flexible connecting elements 18 are typically implemented as a single<br><br>
7 strip of fabric which passes through gripping members 14 (Fig 2) and restoring member 16. Therefore, expandable gripping arrangement 12 is typically formed by selectively molding biocompatible plastic or silicon on top of a single strip of fabric to form gripping members 14, restoring member 16 and flexible connecting elements 18. 5 Flexible connecting elements 18 is typically formed from a synthetic fabric such as nylon. The fabric typically has a width of between 5 mm to 10 mm. The thickness of gripping members 14 and restoring member 16 is typically between 2 mm to 5 mm.<br>
Reference is again made to Figs. 1 to 5. Cervical dilation monitor 10 also includes an elongated element 20 having a calibrated scale 22 disposed thereon.<br>
10 Elongated element 20 is generally hollow. Elongated element 20 has a portion 24 which is translucent, typically transparent Portion 24 also includes calibrated scale 22* Elongated element 20 has two ends, an end 26 and an end 28. End 26 is mechanically connected to approximately the center of restoring member 16. Elongated element 20 is long enough to ensure that calibrated scale 22 is disposed outside of the patient's body.<br>
15 Elongated element 20 is generally formed of clear plastic and is flexible enough to ensure that cervical dilation monitor 10 is not uncomfortable for the patient to use.<br>
Cervical dilation monitor 10 also includes an elongated element 30. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that elongated element 30 can be implemented in a number of ways that will perform the function of elongated element 20. However, in<br>
20 accordance with a most preferred embodiment of the present invention elongated element 30 is a line, typically a nylon thread having a thickness typically in the range of 0.5 mm to 2.5 mm. Elongated element 30 is typically 45 cm long. A line includes any equivalent element that will perform the same function as a line, for example, but not limited to, a cord, a cable, a thread, a wire, a string or a ribbon or flexible strip. A part<br>
25 of elongated element 30 is disposed within elongated element 20 along calibrated scale 22^ This part of elongated element 30 extends substantially from end 26 to end 28. This part of elongated element 30 has an indicator 32 and a movement restrainer 34 disposed thereon. Indicator 32 and movement restrainer 34 are typically plastic beads, which  are  mechanically  connected  to  the  line  forming   elongated  element 30.<br>
30     Indicator 32 provides an indication of the measured cervical dilation as is explained in<br><br>
8 more detail below. Movement restrainer 34 prevents elongated element 30 from over extending into the uterus. For example, once cervical dilation monitor 10 is fully extended, movement restrainer34 prevents any further movement of elongated element 30 as best shown in Fig. 4. Elongated element 20 and elongated element 30 are 5 mechanically connected to expandable gripping arrangement 12, in a manner such that, as expandable gripping arrangement 12 expands with the dilating cervix, relative linear movement is generated between elongated element 20 and elongated element 30, thereby moving indicator 32 with respect to calibrated scale 22 so as to give a measurement of dilation of the cervix. In accordance with the most preferred<br>
10 embodiment of the present invention, the distance moved by indicator 32 is a linear function of the dilation of the cervix.<br>
In accordance with the most preferred embodiment of the present invention, an end 36 of elongated element 30 is typically mechanically connected to one end of restoring member 16. Elongated element 30 is then thread through a loop 38, which is<br>
15 disposed on one gripping member 14. Elongated element 30 is then passed through elongated element 20. Therefore, as the cervix dilates, restoring member 16 pushes gripping members 14 apart, thereby increasing the length of elongated element 30 which is disposed between gripping members 14. Therefore, as the cervix dilates, elongated element 30 and indicator 32 move toward end 26 of elongated element 20.<br>
20 Therefore, the position of indicator 32 with respect to calibrated scale 22 gives a measurement of dilation of the cervix. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that elongated element 30 can be mechanically connected to expandable gripping arrangement 12 in many ways, for example, but not limited to, mechanically connecting one end of elongated element 30 to one end of restoring member 16 or to one gripping<br>
25 member 14 and by threading elongated element 30 through a loop which is disposed on the other end of restoring member 16 or another gripping member 14.<br>
Reference is now made to Figs. 7 and 8. Fig. 7 is a front view of cervical dilation monitor 10 of Fig. 1 with an insertion arrangement 40 installed therein. Fig. 8 is a side view of cervical dilation monitor 10 of Fig. 1 with insertion arrangement 40 installed<br>
30    therein. Prior to fitting of cervical dilation monitor 10 onto a dilating cervix, gripping<br><br>
9<br>
members 14 are expanded, such that the top section 42 of each gripping member 14 is approximately perpendicular with the bottom section 50 of that gripping member 14. Therefore, cervical dilation monitor 10 includes insertion arrangement 40 which is configured to keep gripping members 14 expanded during fitting of expandable 5 gripping arrangement 12 on to the cervix. Insertion arrangement 40 is formed from a rod 44, two arms 46 and a handle 58. Arms 46 are mechanically connected to one end of rod 44 and handle 58 is mechanically connected to the other end of rod 44. Arms 46 are configured, such that, arms 46 have a natural position whereby arms 46 are pushed together. Arms 46 are also configured to be pulled apart as necessary, as will be<br>
10 explained below. Handle 58 is used to help insert and remove insertion arrangement 40 from cervical dilation monitor 10, as will be explained below* Typically, insertion arrangement 40 is formed as a unitary element from plastic. With arms 46 pushed together, insertion arrangement 40 is inserted through elongated element 20. Insertion arrangement 40 is inserted so that arms 46 exit from end 26 of elongated element 20.<br>
15 Each gripping member 14 has a hole 48 disposed therein between top section 42 and bottom section 50. Arms 46 are separated and each arm 46 is uniquely fed through one of holes 48 to support one of top sections 42. Therefore, insertion arrangement 40 is partially disposed within elongated element 20 with arms 46 being disposed outside of elongated element 20. Rod 44 and arms 46 are generally formed as rigid elements. The<br>
20 mechanical connection between rod 44 and arms 46 is rigid enough to keep gripping members 14 expanded by arms 46 supporting top sections 42. Nevertheless, the mechanical connection between rod 44 and arms 46 is flexible enough to enable arms 46 to move apart, and therefore gripping members 14 to move apart, under the action of restoring member 16, which is necessary when cervical dilation monitor 10 is<br>
25 fitted onto a partially dilated cervix, as is described in more detail with reference to Fig. 1L It should be noted that insertion arrangement 40 is typically inserted into cervical dilation monitor 10 as part of the manufacture of cervical dilation monitor 10. Therefore, the cervical dilation monitor 10 is typically supplied ready to use, with insertion arrangement 40 inserted, as well as cervical dilation monitor 10 being<br>
30     sterilized. There is a seal 56 (Fig. 8) which is disposed between end 26 of elongated<br><br>
10<br>
element 20 and restoring member 16 to prevent movement restrainer 34 (Fig. 7) from<br>
exiting elongated element 20 via end 26. End 26 of elongated element 20 is configured<br>
to reduce fluid leakage into elongated element 20 by shaping end 26 around restoring<br>
member 16.<br>
5	Reference is now made to Fig. 9, which is a cross-sectional view through the line<br>
B-B of Fig. 7. Elongated element 20 is divided into two sections, a section 52 and a section 54. Section 52 is used for elongated element 30 and section 54 is used for insertion arrangement 40.<br>
Reference is now made to Figs 10 and 11. Fig. 10 is a front view of the cervical<br>
10 dilation monitor 10 of Fig. 1 being fitted onto a cervix. Fig. 11 is a front view of cervical dilation monitor 10 of Fig. 1 being fitted onto a partially dilated cervix. Elongated element 30 includes a control element 60 disposed thereon external to elongated element 20 and external to the patient. Control element 60 is typically a clip which is configured to enable an obstetrician to move elongated element 30 in order to<br>
15 contract and expand expandable gripping arrangement 12 for fitting onto the cervix. Control element 60 is configured to be removable from and attachable to elongated element 30, as necessary, in order to clamp elongated element 30 in a certain position without necessitating the obstetrician to constantly hold onto control element 60 or elongated element 30. Additionally, control element 60 provides a grip surface for an<br>
20 obstetrician to pull and release elongated element 30. Prior to insertion of cervical dilation monitor 10 into a patient, expandable gripping arrangement 12 is contracted, typically as part of the manufacture process, by pulling elongated element 30 taught* Insertion arrangement 40 is then inserted into cervical dilation monitor 10, also typically as part of the manufacture process, to keep gripping members 14 expanded.<br>
25 With one hand the obstetrician holds cervical dilation monitor 10 and with the other hand the obstetrician observes the state of the cervix. If the cervix is partially dilated (Fig. 11), elongated element 30 needs to be released slowly until top sections 42 of gripping members 14 come into contact with the wall of the cervix. The obstetrician then slowly removes insertion arrangement 40 from cervical dilation monitor 10,<br>
30     thereby enabling gripping members 14 to contract and grip the cervix, as shown in Fig.<br><br>
11<br>
12. Cervical dilation monitor 10 is now fitted and is ready to perform continuous,<br>
accurate and objective monitoring of cervical dilation. The monitoring can be easily<br>
performed by people other than a physician, such as family of the patient Moreover,<br>
cervical dilation monitor 10 removes the need for repeated vaginal examinations.<br>
5	Reference is now made to Figs. 13, 14 and 15. Fig. 13 is a view of the cervical<br>
dilation monitor of Fig. 1 after 30 mm dilation of the cervix. Fig. 14 is a view of the cervical dilation monitor of Fig. 1 after 50 mm dilation of the cervix. Fig. 15 is a view of the cervical dilation monitor of Fig. 1 after the cervix is fully dilated. As discussed above with reference to Figs. 1 to 5, as the cervix dilates, restoring member 16 pushes<br>
10 gripping members 14 apart so that gripping members 14 continually grip the cervix. Additionally, the length of elongated element 30 which is disposed between gripping members 14 increases as the cervix dilates. Also, flexible connecting elements 18 enable movement among gripping members 14 and restoring member 16 to allow for the shape changes of gripping members 14 and restoring member 16. Additionally,<br>
15 flexible connecting elements 18 enable movement among gripping members 14 and restoring member 16 to allow for the changes in the relative position of the dilating cervix, which is gradually moving upward, and gripping members 14. Additionally, as the cervix dilates it normally also effaces. Therefore, gripping members 14 continually contract to ensure that they hold onto the cervix during dilation and effacement of the<br>
20     cervix.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 16, which is a front view of a cervical dilation monitor 62 which is constructed and operable in accordance with a first alternate embodiment of the present invention. Cervical dilation monitor 62 is implemented in substantially the same way as cervical dilation monitor 10 (Fig.l) except that with<br>
25 cervical dilation monitor 62, elongated element 30 is mechanically connected to one end of restoring member 16 and elongated element 30 is then fed through a loop which is disposed on the other end of restoring member 16.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 17, which is a front view of a cervical dilation monitor 68 which is constructed and operable in accordance with a second alternate<br>
30     embodiment of the present invention. Cervical dilation monitor 68 is implemented in<br><br>
12<br>
substantially the same way as cervical dilation monitor 10 (Fig. 1) except that with<br>
cervical dilation monitor 68, elongated element 30 is mechanically connected to one<br>
gripping member 14 and elongated element 30 is then fed through a loop which is<br>
disposed on the other gripping member 14.<br>
5	Reference is now made to Fig. 18, which is a front view of a cervical dilation<br>
monitor 70 which is constructed and operable in accordance with a third alternate embodiment of the present invention. Cervical dilation monitor 70 is implemented in substantially the same way as cervical dilation monitor 10 (Fig. 1) except that with cervical dilation monitor 70, elongated element 30 forms a closed loop 72 at one end of<br>
10 elongated element 30. The closed loop of elongated element 30 is mechanically connected to restoring member 16 by a loop 74 at one end of restoring member 16 and by another loop 76 at the other end of restoring member 16.<br>
Reference is now made to Figs. 19 and 20. Fig. 19 is a front view of the cervical dilation monitor 62 of Fig. 16 in a contracted state, implemented with a first alternate<br>
15 embodiment of gripping members 78. Fig. 20 is a front view of cervical dilation monitor 62 of Fig. 19 in an expanded state. Gripping members 78 have a profile which is similar to an inverted profile of gripping members 14.<br>
Reference is now made to Figs. 21 and 22. Fig. 21 is a front view of cervical dilation monitor 62 of Fig. 16 in a contracted state, implemented with a second alternate<br>
20 embodiment of gripping members 80. Fig. 22 is a front view of cervical dilation monitor 62 of Fig. 21 in an expanded state. Gripping members 80 provide larger gripping surfaces than gripping members 14. Additionally, restoring member 16 and gripping members 80 do not include an embedded fabric strip, in this embodiment, flexible connecting elements 18 are replaced by two flexible connecting elements 106.<br>
25 Each flexible connecting element 106 is formed from a plastic strip which is bent over itself a number of time in alternate directions.<br>
Reference is now made to Figs. 23 to 26. Fig. 23 is a front view of a cervical dilation monitor 82 having an external insertion arrangement 84 that is constructed and operable in accordance with a fourth alternate embodiment of the present invention.<br>
30     Fig. 24 is a side view of cervical dilation monitor 82. Fig. 25 is a front view of a<br><br>
13 gripping member 86 of cervical dilation monitor 82, gripping member 86 being in a contracted state. Fig. 26 is a front view of cervical dilation monitor 82 without insertion arrangement 84, cervical dilation monitor 82 being in an expanded state. Cervical dilation monitor 82 is implemented in substantially the same way as cervical dilation 5 monitor 10 (Fig. 1) except for the following differences. Cervical dilation monitor 82 has an outwardly biased V-shaped restoring member 88. Restoring member 88 differs from restoring member 16 (Fig. 1) in that restoring member 88 has two arms 90, each arm 90 being rigid and straight for most of its length. Restoring member 88 includes an embedded metal strip 92 (Fig, 23), which is disposed in the central section of restoring<br>
10 member 88, to give restoring member 88 resilience with outward bias. Gripping member 86 has a profile that is an inverted profile of gripping member 14 of cervical dilation monitor 10 (Fig.l). Each gripping member 86 includes an embedded metal strip 98 (Fig. 23) to give gripping member 86 resilience with inward bias. Elongated element 30 (Fig. 26) is mechanically connected to one end of restoring member 88 and<br>
15 elongated element 30 is fed through a loop which is disposed on the other end of restoring member 88. Insertion arrangement 84 performs the same function as insertion arrangement 40. Insertion arrangement 84 is disposed externally to elongated element 20. Insertion arrangement 84 has two arms 94 which uniquely pass through one of two holes 96 in gripping members 86 to keep gripping members 86 expanded during<br>
20     fitting of cervical dilation monitor 82 onto the cervix.<br>
Reference is now made to Figs. 27 and 28. Fig. 27 is a front view of a cervical dilation monitor 100 in a contracted state that is constructed and operable in accordance with a fifth alternate embodiment of the present invention. Fig. 28 is a front view of cervical dilation monitor 100 in an expanded state. Cervical dilation monitor 100 is<br>
25 implemented in substantially the same way as cervical dilation monitor 82 (Figs. 23 to 26) except for the following differences. Elongated element 30 is replaced by a rigid rod 102 and two rigid arms 104. A part of rod 102 is disposed within elongated element 20. This part of rod 102 has an indicator (not shown) disposed thereon, which is used as a measure of dilation of the cervix against calibrated scale 22 (not shown) on<br>
30     elongated element 20. One end of rod 102 extends out of end 26 of elongated<br><br>
*<br>
14 element 20. This end of rod 102 is mechanically connected to one end of arms 104. The other end of one arm 104 is mechanically connected to a central portion of one arm 90 of restoring member 88. The other end of the other arm 104 is mechanically connected to a central portion of the other arm 90. The mechanical connections with arms 104 are 5 configured, such that, arms 104 can swing with respect to the elements connected to arms 104. Therefore, as the cervix expands, restoring member 88 pushes gripping members 86 apart, thereby causing the mechanical connection between arms 104 and rod 102 to move closer to end 26 of elongated element 20. Therefore, as the cervix expands, rod 102 is pushed away from end 26 of elongated element 20. Therefore, the<br>
10     position of the indicator on rod 102 gives a measurement of the dilation of the cervix.<br>
Reference is now made to Figs. 29 to 31. Fig. 29 is a front view of a cervical dilation monitor 108 in an expanded state that is constructed and operable in accordance with a sixth alternate embodiment of the present invention. Fig. 30 is a front view of cervical dilation monitor 108 of Fig. 29 inserted into an insertion tube 110. Fig. 31 is a<br>
15 front view of cervical dilation monitor 108 of Fig. 30 being pushed out of insertion tube 110. Insertion tube 110 serves as a conduit which guides cervical dilation monitor 108 and facilitates the installation of cervical dilation monitor 108 on to the cervix. In operation, restoring member 16 of cervical dilation monitor 108 is first contracted so as to fit into insertion tube 110. At the same time, gripping members 14<br>
20 are held in an expanded state and are fully opened while cervical dilation monitor 108 is located within insertion tube 110, in order that gripping members 14 are ready to be positioned onto the dilating cervix as cervical dilation monitor 108 is pushed out of insertion tube 110 (best seen in Fig. 30). Next, cervical dilation monitor 108 is pushed out of insertion tube 110 (best seen in Fig. 31) with top sections 42 of gripping<br>
25 members 14 leading the way. As cervical dilation monitor 108 continues to slide out of insertion tube 110, top sections 42 of gripping members 14 are no longer kept in the expanded state by insertion tube 110 and top section 42 of gripping members 14 begin to contract in a sideways motion, thereby enabling top section 42 of gripping members 14 to grip the inner aspect of the cervix. At this point, bottom sections 50 of<br>
30     gripping members 14 remain in an expanded state as bottom sections 50 are still held by<br><br>
15 insertion tube 110. As cervical dilation monitor 108 is further pushed out of insertion tube 110, bottom sections 50 of gripping members 14 are released from insertion tube 110. Bottom sections 50 of gripping members 14 contract rapidly, thus gripping the fornix, the external aspect of the cervix. Now gripping members 14 are located on 5 the cervix, facing opposite directions and clinging to the dilating and effacing tissue of the cervix. Finally, insertion tube 110 is removed from the birth canal.<br>
