				<td>METHOD OF PURIFYING FISCHER-TROPSCH DERIVED WATER<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
5 This invention relates to the purification of water produced during Fischer-<br>
Tropsch synthesis for which synthesis a variety of carbonaceous materials are<br>
used as feedstock.<br>
Background to the Invention<br>
10<br>
The applicant is aware of processes for the synthesis of water from a<br>
carbonaceous feedstock, such as natural gas and coal, which processes also<br>
produce hydrocarbons.<br>
15 One such process is the Fischer-Tropsch process of which the largest product is<br>
water and, to a lesser extent, hydrocarbons including olefins, paraffins, waxes,<br>
and oxygenates. There are numerous references to this process such as, for<br>
example on pages 265 to 278 of "Technology of the Fischer-Tropsch process" by<br>
Mark Dry, Catal. Rev. Sci.Eng., Volume 23 (1 &amp;2), 1981.<br>
20<br>
The products from the Fischer-Tropsch process may be processed further, for<br>
example by hydroprocessing, to produce products including synthetic crude oil,<br>
olefins, solvents, lubricating, industrial or medicinal oil, waxy hydrocarbons,<br>
nitrogen and oxygen containing compounds, motor gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel<br>
25 and kerosene. Lubricating oil includes automotive, jet, turbine and metal working<br>
oils. Industrial oil includes well drilling fluids, agricultural oils and heat transfer<br>
fluids.<br>
In certain areas where carbonaceous feedstocks are to be found, water is in<br>
30 short supply and a relatively costly commodity. Also, environmental concerns<br>
prevent the dumping of polluted water derived from the Fischer-Tropsch process<br>
into natural water ways and the sea thereby presenting a case for the production<br>
and recovery of useable water at the source of the carbonaceous feedstocks.<br>
The carbonaceous feedstocks typically include coal and natural gas that are<br>
5 converted to hydrocarbons, water and carbon dioxide during Fischer-Tropsch<br>
synthesis. Naturally, other carbonaceous feedstocks such as, for example,<br>
methane hydrates found in marine deposits can also be used.<br>
Before the water produced during the Fischer-Tropsch process is purified in<br>
10 accordance with the present invention, it is typically subjected to preliminary<br>
separation aimed at isolating a water-enriched stream from the Fischer-Tropsch<br>
products.<br>
The preliminary separation process includes condensing the gaseous product<br>
15 from the Fischer-Tropsch reactor and separating it in a typical three-phase<br>
separator. The three streams exiting the separator are: a tail gas, a hydrocarbon<br>
condensate including mainly hydrocarbons in the C5 to C20 range and a reaction<br>
water stream containing dissolved oxygenated hydrocarbons and suspended<br>
hydrocarbons.<br>
20<br>
The reaction water stream is then separated using a coalescer that separates the<br>
reaction water stream into a hydrocarbon suspension and a water-rich stream.<br>
The coalescer is capable of removing hydrocarbons from the reaction water<br>
25 stream to a concentration of between 10 ppm and I000 ppm, typically 50 ppm.<br>
The water-enriched stream thus obtained forms the feedstock for the method<br>
according to the present invention and will be denoted in this specification by the<br>
term "Fischer-Tropsch reaction water".<br>
30<br>
The composition of the water-enriched stream or reaction water is largely<br>
dependent on the metal used in the Fischer-Tropsch catalyst and the reaction<br>
conditions (e.g. temperature, pressure) employed. The Fischer-Tropsch reaction<br>
water can contain oxygenated hydrocarbons including aliphatic, aromatic and<br>
5 cyclic alcohols, aldehydes, ketones and acids, and to a lesser extent aliphatic,<br>
aromatic and cyclic hydrocarbons such as olefins and paraffins.<br>
The Fischer-Tropsch reaction water may also contain small quantities of<br>
inorganic compounds including metals from the Fischer-Tropsch reactor, as well<br>
10 as nitrogen and sulphur containing species that originate from the feedstock.<br>
The influence of the type of Fischer-Tropsch synthesis used on the quality of<br>
Fischer-Tropsch reaction water is illustrated in typical organic analysis (Table 1)<br>
of Fischer-Tropsch reaction water generated from three different synthesis<br>
15 operating modes, namely:<br>
Low Temperature Fischer-Tropsch LTFT Cobalt or Iron<br>
catalysts<br>
High Temperature Fischer-Tropsch HTFT Iron catalyst<br>
20<br>
Table 1: Typical Organic Composition of Fischer-Tropsch reaction water<br>
from Different Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis Operating Modes<br>
It is evident from the typical analyses of Fischer-Tropsch reaction waters of<br>
different origin (Table 1) that these waters, in particular HT Fischer-Tropsch<br>
reaction water, contain relatively high concentrations of organic compounds, and<br>
5 direct application or disposal of these waters is generally not feasible without<br>
further treatment to remove undesirable constituents. The degree of treatment of<br>
the Fischer-Tropsch reaction water depends largely ori the intended application,<br>
and it is possible to produce a wide range of water qualities ranging from boiler<br>
feed water to partially treated water which may be suitable for discharge to the<br>
10 environment.<br>
Inorganic components<br>
It is also possible to co-treat Fischer-Tropsch reaction water with other typical<br>
process waste water as well as rain water.<br>
15 The water purification processes described in this invention may, after making<br>
minor adaptations, also be used for the processing of aqueous streams derived<br>
from generic synthesis gas conversion processes using metallic catalysts similar<br>
to the catalysts used during Fischer-Tropsch synthesis.<br>

20 Summary of the Invention<br>
According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a process for<br>
the production of purified water from Fischer Tropsch reaction water, which<br>
process includes at least the steps of:-<br>
25 a) a primary treatment stage comprising an equilibrium staged separation<br>
process having at least one stage for removing at least a fraction of nonacid<br>
oxygenated hydrocarbons from the Fischer Tropsch reaction water to<br>
produce a primary water-enriched stream;<br>
and<br>
30 b) a secondary treatment stage comprising at least one membrane separation<br>

process for removing at least some suspended solids and acidic<br>
oxygenated hydrocarbons from at least a portion of the primary waterenriched<br>
stream.<br>
5 The term "purified water" is to be interpreted as meaning an aqueous stream<br>
having a COD of between 20 and 500 mgll, a pH of between 6,O and 9,0, a<br>
suspended solids content of less than 250 mgll and a total dissolved solids<br>
content of less than 600 mgll.<br>
10 The non-acid oxygenated hydrocarbons are typically selected from the group<br>
including: alcohols, aldehydes and ketones, more specifically from the group<br>
including: acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, butyraldehyde, acetone, methyl<br>
propyl ketone, methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, pentanol, hexanol, and<br>
heptanol.<br>
15<br>
The suspended solids are typically catalyst particles.<br>
The acidic oxygenated hydrocarbons are typically selected from the group<br>
including: formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, valeric acid,<br>
20 hexanoic acid, heptanoic acid and octanoic acid.<br>
A number of equilibrium staged separation processes are suitable for use in the<br>
primary treatment stage. Such processes may include conventional distillation<br>
processes typically used in the refining and petrochemical industry as well as<br>
25 solvent extraction using either conventional liquid solvents or liquefied gases.<br>
When distillation is used as the primary treatment stage, the bulk of the non-acid<br>
oxygenated hydrocarbons contained in the Fischer Tropsch reaction water are<br>
removed, leaving predominantly mono-carboxylic acids (e.g. acetic acid,<br>
30 propionic acid) and optionally trace quantities of non-acid compounds. As a result<br>
of the presence of organic acids, FischerTropsch reaction water that has<br>
undergone primary treatment is known as Fischer Tropsch acid water (primary<br>
water-enriched stream).<br>
The overheads from distillation may be recovered and worked-up to products, or<br>
5 may be used for fuel or as an energy source.<br>
The primary treatment stage may further include a liquid-liquid separation<br>
process such as, for example, liquid-liquid extraction, in which the primary waterenriched<br>
stream is separated into an acid-enriched and a primary water-enriched<br>
10 stream.<br>
The acid-enriched stream may be treated further to recover the acids contained<br>
in it.<br>
15 The primary treatment stage may include degassing of the Fischer Tropsch<br>
reaction water before further processing to remove compounds having a very low<br>
boiling point and dissolved gases.<br>
Typically, Fischer Tropsch reaction water originating from HTFT iron catalyst<br>
20 processes which water has undergone primary treatment has limited application<br>
due to the relatively high concentrations (&gt; 1 % by mass) of organic acids<br>
remaining in the Fischer Tropsch acid water, and further treatment of the water is<br>
required. In contrast, Fischer Tropsch reaction' water originating from cobaltbased<br>
LTFT processes which water has undergone primary treatment contains<br>
25 significantly lower organic acid concentrations (
therefore, following neutralization, be released to the environment if sufficient<br>
dilution is available and discharge standards permit. This water may also have<br>
limited application as process water.<br>
30 A number of membrane separation processes are suitable for use in the<br>
secondary treatment stage, depending on which constituent is to be removed.<br>
The membrane processes used in the secondary treatment stage are typically<br>
selected from the group including: micro-filtration, ultra-filtration, reverse osmosis<br>
and pervaporation.<br>
5<br>
The secondary treatment stage may include a solid-liquid separation step in<br>
which microfiltration and/ or ultrafiltration is used for the removal of at least a<br>
fraction of the suspended solids from the primary water-enriched stream.<br>
10 Micro-filtration typically includes using capillary polypropylene membranes with a<br>
nominal cut-off of 0,2 micrometer or molecular cut-off (MWCO) of 90 000 for<br>
removal of catalyst particles at typical pressures of 1 000 kPa, pH at 4 to 7 and<br>
temperatures of less than 40°C. Ultra-filtration typically includes using tubular<br>
poly-ether sulphone membranes with typically cut-off points of between 10 000<br>
15 and 40 000 for removal of catalyst particles and suspended oils at typical<br>
pressures of less than 2 000 kPa, pH of between 4 and 7 and temperatures of<br>
less than 40°C.<br>
The secondary treatment stage may further include one or more liquid-liquid<br>
20 separation steps in which reverse osmosis and/or pervaporation is used to<br>
remove at least a fraction of the organic compounds in the primary waterenriched<br>
stream. Reverse osmosis may be implemented using either a spiral or<br>
a tubular configuration and pervaporation is typically applied using membrane<br>
distillation.<br>
25<br>
Reverse osmosis typically includes using spiral wound poly-amide membranes<br>
with point rejection of better than 99,6 % (typically sea-water membranes) or<br>
poly-ether composite membranes with a point rejection of better than 99,6 % for<br>
removal of organic substances at typical pressures of less than 60 bar, pH of 4 to<br>
30 7 and temperatures of less than 40°C.<br>
Pervaporation typically includes using flat sheet, chemically cross linked polyvinyl<br>
alcohol membranes or a polymer blend of poly-vinyl alcohol and poly-acrylic<br>
acid membranes for removal of organics which do not form azeotropes and at<br>
typical pressures of less than 4 mm Hg, pH of ca 7 and temperatures of between<br>
5 30 and 70°C.<br>
The pH of the primary water-enriched stream may be adjusted prior to organic<br>
removal thereby to convert organic acids into organic salts. Since organic salts<br>
are rejected by membranes more readily'than organic acids are, pH adjustment<br>
10 in effect maximizes and economizes the removal of organic constituents.<br>
The liquid-liquid separation step results in the production of stream of purified<br>
water and a stream enriched with organic constituents., The organic constituents<br>
are typically fatty acids.<br>
15<br>
The purified water may be subjected to a further liquid-liquid separation step (or<br>
steps) as described above to further reduce the amount of organic constituents<br>
contained therein.<br>
20 Applications for the purified water produced by the method described above may<br>
include its use as cooling water, make up, and irrigation water.<br>
The purified water typically has the following characteristics:<br>

process for removing at least some suspended solids and acidic<br>

stream to produce a secondary water-enriched stream; and<br>
Suspended solids<br>
c) a tertiary treatment stage comprising a dissolved salt and organic removal<br>
stage for removing at least some dissolved salts and organic constituents from at<br>
15 least a portion of the secondary water-enriched stream.<br>

stream having a COD of less than 50 mgll, a pH of between 6,O and 9,0, a<br>

5 The dissolved salts removed during the tertiary stage are typically selected from<br>
the group'including: calcium and sodium salts as well as traces of magnesium,<br>
iron and other salts.<br>
The organic constituents removed during the tertiary treatments stage are<br>
10 typically selected from the group comprising: acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde,<br>
butyraldehyde, acetone, methyl propyl ketone, methanol, ethanol, propanol,<br>
butanol, pentanol, hexanol, heptanol, formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid,<br>
butyric acid, and valeric acid.<br>

water-enriched stream).<br>
The overheads from distillation may be recovered and worked-up to products, or<br>
may be used for fuel or as an energy source.<br>
30<br>
The primary treatment stage may further include a liquid-liquid separation<br>
process such as, for example, liquid-liquid extraction, in which the primary waterenriched<br>
stream is separated into an acid-enriched and a primary water-enriched<br>
stream.<br>

The acid-enriched stream may be treated further to recover the acids contained<br>
in it.<br>
The primary treatment stage may include degassing of the Fischer Tropsch<br>
10 reaction water before further processing to remove compounds having a very low<br>
boiling point and dissolved gases.<br>
Typically, Fischer-Tropsch reaction water originating from HTFT iron catalyst<br>
processes which water has undergone primary treatment has limited application<br>
15 due to the relatively high concentrations (&gt; 1 % by mass) of organic acids<br>
remaining in the FT acid water and further treatment of the water is required. In<br>
contrast, Fischer-Tropsch reaction water originating from cobalt-based LTFT<br>
processes which water has undergone primary treatment contains significantly<br>
lower organic acid concentrations (

The membrane processes used in the secondary treatment stage are typically<br>
selected from the group including: micro-filtration, ultra-filtration, reverse osmosis<br>
and pervaporation.<br>
30<br>
The secondary treatment stage may include a solid-liquid separation step in<br>
which microfiltration and1 or ultrafiltration is used for the removal of at least a<br>
fraction of the suspended solids from the primary water-enriched stream.<br>
5 Micro-filtration typically includes using capillary polypropylene membranes with a<br>
nominal cut-off of 0,2 micrometer or molecular cut-off (MWCO) of 90 000 for<br>
removal of catalyst particles at typical pressures of 1 000 kPa, pH at 4 to 7 and<br>
temperatures of less than 40°c. Ultra-filtration typically includes using tubular<br>
poly-ether sulphone membranes with typically cut-off points of between 10 000<br>
10 and 40 000 for removal of catalyst particles and suspended oils at typical<br>
pressures of less than 2 000 kPa, pH of between 4 and 7 and temperatures of<br>
less than 40°C.<br>
The secondary treatment stage may further include one or more liquid-liquid<br>
15 separation steps in which reverse osmosis and1 or pervaporation is used to<br>
remove at least a fraction of the organic compounds in the primary waterenriched<br>
stream. Reverse osmosis may be implemented using either a spiral or<br>
a tubular configuration and pervaporation is typically applied using membrane<br>

Reverse osmosis typically includes using spiral wound poly-amide membranes<br>
with point rejection of better than 99,6 % (typically sea-water membranes) or<br>
poly-ether composite membranes with a point rejection of better than 99,6 % for<br>
removal of organic substances at typical pressures of less than 60 bar, pH<br>
25 between 4 and 7 and temperatures of less than 40°C.<br>
Pervaporation typically includes using flat sheet, chemically cross linked polyvinyl<br>
alcohol membranes or a polymer blend of poly-vinyl alcohol and poly-acrylic<br>
acid membranes for removal of organics which do not form azeotropes and at<br>

30 and 70°C. - '<br>
The pH of the primary water-enriched stream may be adjusted prior to organic<br>
removal thereby to convert organic acids into organic salts. Since organic salts<br>
are rejected by membranes more readily than organic acids are, pH adjustment<br>
in effect maximizes and economizes the removal of organic constituents.<br>
5<br>
The liquid-liquid separation step results in the production of a stream of purified<br>
water and a stream enriched with organic constituents. The organic constituents<br>
are typically fatty acids. The purified water may be subjected to a further liquidliquid<br>
separation step (or steps) as described above to further reduce the amount<br>
10 of organic constituents contained therein.<br>
The tertiary treatment stage may include one or more of the following separation<br>
methods for the removal of salts from the secondary water-enriched stream: ion<br>
exchange and high rejection reverse osmosis.<br>
15<br>
The tertiary treatment stage may further include one or more of the following<br>
separation methods for the removal of organic constituents from the secondary<br>
water-enriched stream: use of activated carbon, organic scavenger resins, and<br>
chemical oxidation (e.g. ozone and hydrogen peroxides with our without a<br>
20 catalyst or ultraviolet light generated free radicals)<br>
Applications for the highly purified water produced by the method described<br>

15 Example: Treatment of Fischer Tropsch reaction water from an iron<br>
catalyst HTFT process<br>
After separation of by-products, a water-enriched stream from an HTFT process<br>
was degassed at atmospheric pressure in an open vessel. Free hydrocarbons in<br>
20 the water-enriched stream were reduced to 0.01 % (by mass) using a coalescer.<br>
Primary treatment of the thus obtained FT reaction water was undertaken using<br>
distillation and the compositions of the Fischer Tropsch reaction water and a<br>
primary water-enriched stream are given in Table 2.<br>

Primary treatment of the HTFT reaction water 12 was effected using distillation<br>
14 which yielded an acidic bottom or primary water-enriched stream 16 and a<br>
10 stream 18 enriched with non-acid oxygenated hydrocarbons. Analysis of the<br>
primary water-enriched stream I 6 from the distillation column 14 is detailed in<br>

It is evident from this analysis that a large fraction of non-acid components was<br>
15 removed from the Fischer Tropsch reaction water stream 12 during primary<br>
distillation 14 leaving an organic acid enriched stream 16 containing 1.25 % (by<br>
mass) organic acids consisting predominantly of acetic acid. The measured COD<br>
of this stream 16 was in the order of 16000 mg 02/1.<br>

For further treatment of the FT acid water stream 16, two alternatives were<br>
investigated. In alternative 1, a fraction 20 of the Fischer Tropsch acid water<br>
(primary water-enriched stream 16), was treated in an Acid Extraction plant 22<br>
where about 50 % of the organic acids present in stream 20 were extracted using<br>
5 methyl-tertiary-buthyl ether (MTBE) producing an acid rich stream 23 and a water<br>
enriched stream 24 known as the acid extraction raffinate. The acid enriched<br>
stream 23 could be reworked in the upstream facilities while the raffinate 24 from<br>
the extraction plant 22 containing about 0,5 % by mass organic acids, was then<br>
cooled and sent to a secondary treatment stage comprising membrane<br>
10 separation processes 28. The membrane separation processes consisted of<br>
multi-stage spiral reverse osmosis (SRO) units using high rejection poly-amide<br>
membranes. Membrane flux was on average 45 LMH (llm2.h) whilst the water<br>
recovery was 90% on average.<br>
15 Purified water 34 with an average carboxylic acid concentration of 0.05 % by<br>
mass was produced as well as a concentrated acids stream 40 containing about<br>
6 % by mass carboxylic acids. The latter could be reworked in the upstream<br>
facilities while tertiary treatment 36 could be applied to the purified water 34. The<br>
tertiary treatment stage 36 comprised a polishing step using activated carbon<br>
20 (AC) for removal of the final traces of COD. Activated carbon treatment could<br>
effectively reduce the carboxylic acid concentration of stream 16 to 30 mgll in the<br>
highly purified water stream 38 making this water stream 38 suitable to substitute<br>
raw water intake.<br>
25 In alternative 2, stream 16 was cooled prior to ultra-filtration (UF) 26 (using polyether-<br>
sulphone membranes) during which mainly fine catalyst particles 30 were<br>
removed. UF achieved effective removal of catalyst particles from stream 16<br>
producing a substantially solids-free stream 32. Membrane flux was on average<br>
80 llm2.h and the silt density index (SDI) of the product stream 32 was<br>
30 consistently less than 3. Water recovery was consistently above 90%.<br>
The resulting stream 32 was then subjected to multi-stage spiral reverse osmosis<br>
(SRO) treatment 33 using high rejection poly-amide membranes which treatment<br>
33 yielded a stream of purified water 35.<br>
5 The stream of purified water 35 produced during SRO treatment 33 contained on<br>
average 0,09 % by mass carboxylic acids. An acid-enriched stream 37 produced<br>
during SRO contained about 6 % carboxylic acids. Membrane flux was on<br>
average 40 LMH and the water recovery was on average 80 %. The acidenriched<br>
stream 37 could be reworked in upstream facilities to recover its acid<br>
10 constituents as product.<br>
The purified water stream 35 was then sent to a tertiary treatment stage<br>
comprising a polishing step 39 using activated carbon (AC) for removal of the<br>
final traces of COD which step yielded a stream of highly purified water 41.<br>
15<br>
Activated carbon treatment could effectively reduce the carboxylic acid<br>
concentration to 30 mgll in the highly purified water stream 41 making this water<br>
stream 41 suitable to substitute raw water intake.<br>
20 Depending on the final intended use of the purified 34, 35 or highly purified water<br>
38, 41, the minimum water quality requirements are as set out in Table 3 below<br>
and the operating conditions of the equipment used in the method as well as<br>
suitable treatment options can be selected accordingly.<br>
