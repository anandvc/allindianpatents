				<td>NEW PORPHYRIN DERIVATES, IN PARTICULAR CHLORINS AND/OR BACTERIOCHLORINS AND THEIR APPLICATIONS IN PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY<br>
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a technique used for treating several types of diseases, in particular certain types of cancer. Such technique consists in marking the pathological tissues with a photosensitizer, then in causing selective destruction of said tissues while exposing them to a light source of a specific wavelength. Such monochromatic light is generally produced by a laser or a laser diode.<br>
By photosensitizer is meant any molecule liable to store light energy, to be activated by said energy and to lend itself therefore to numerous biochemical combinations.<br>
The photosensitizer, generally between 0.1 and 0.5 micromole/kg of body mass, is delivered to the patient, then picked up by the cells of the whole organism. The photosensitizing molecule accumulates preferably in cancerous cells, but remains inactive until exposed to a light of appropriate wavelength. The illumination or irradiation of the tumour by light activates the molecule, which then interacts with oxygen and forms a transient substance, in particular singlet oxygen. Singlet oxygen is a very reactive and toxic molecule which destroys the cancerous cells wherein the photosensitizer has concentrated.<br>
A certain time elapses between the delivery of the photosensitizer and its activation by means of the laser light. The laser light used in photodynamic therapy is focused by means of an optic fibre and is applied only for a few minutes. The practitioner holds the optic fibre in close vicinity of the cancer so as to delivery the correct amount of light. Consequently, photodynamic therapy only damages the healthy cells minimally.<br>
At the initial stage of a cancer, the objective of such technique may consist in eliminating completely and curing the cancer but, at an advanced stage, it may consist in reducing the volume of the tumour in order to alleviate symptoms. New normal cells replace those destroyed by photodynamic therapy, which enables rapid healing after treatment and avoids particularly ungracious scars which may form with other others of ablation of tissues.<br><br>
Even patients already treated by surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy may be subjected to this technique reliably.<br>
By way of examples of diseases which may be treated by photodynamic therapy, one may quote in particular stomach, intestine, lung, breast, uterus, oesophagus, ovary, pancreas, liver, bladder, bile, tongue, brain, skin, thyroid, prostate, parotid gland cancer, as well as certain viral and/or microbial diseases.<br>
Photodynamic therapy may also be used as a means for diagnosing certain forms of cancer. In this view, it suffices that the photosensitizing molecules are fluorescent and, hence, capable of emitting light when they receive a radiation.<br>
At the moment, the use of certain porphyrin derivatives, in particular hematoporphyrin, as photosensitizers is known in photodynamic therapy. This agent, known under the trademark Photofrin, registered by AXCAN PHARMA INC., is a purified mixture of hematoporphyrin. Hematoporphyrin is in turn a derivative of porcine hemoglobin.<br>
Besides, Photofrin® has been the sole photosensitizing molecule until now, which has been authorised for marketing in several countries and, in particular in France, for treating oesophagus cancer.<br>
In spite of the advantages shown by Photofrin®, such as its solubility in an aqueous medium, a good throughput of singlet oxygen formation and an easy synthesis, it still exhibits a few shortcomings.<br>
First of all, Photofrin® is activated by a 630 nm light. Still, at such wavelength, the penetration of light into the tissues only ranges from 5 to 10 mm, which exhibits a severe handicap when tumours are wider and deeper. Moreover, such photosensitizer causes cutaneous photosensitivity up to six weeks after treatment. Finally, that fact that Photofrin® is a mixture of several molecules, makes the choice of the appropriate dosimetry more difficult, of the photosensitizer as well as of the light delivered.<br>
Among other compounds under study, so-called second generation compounds, the document WO-98/50386 describes certain benzoporphyrine derivatives. Such derivatives exhibit certain advantages relative to Photofrin® in that they absorb light at a 690 nm wavelength and, consequently, may be used in the<br><br>
treatment of wider and deeper cancers. Such derivates exhibit moreover better selectivity against cancerous cells.<br>
However, certain problem associated with selectivity, light absorption and toxicity persist.<br>
The purpose of the present invention is to offer new porphyrin derivatives, such as in particular chlorins and/or bacteriochlorins which remedy the shortcomings aforementioned, in particular as regards preferential accumulation in cancerous cells, better stability and lower phototoxicity.<br>
Another aim of the present invention is to offer an anti-cancerous and/or anti-viral and/or anti-microbial medication in order to be used in photodynamic therapy.<br>
Other aims and advantages of the invention will appear in the following description which is given only by way of example and without being limited thereto.<br>
The present invention relates to a porphyrin derivative, in particular chlorin, of formula:<br>
(Figure Removed)   <br>
-	  X1 X2, X3, X4, X5, X6, X7, X8 are each, identical or different, selected among<br>
halogen atoms and/or hydrogen atoms ;<br>
-	R1, R2, R3, R4 are each, identical or different, selected among the moieties : -OH,<br>
amino acids, -OR and -NHR and/or chlorine atom, wherein R is an alkyl moiety<br>
having 1 to 12 carbon atoms.<br>
The present invention also relates to a porphyrin derivative,  in particular bacteriochlorin, of formula :<br>
(Figure Removed)   <br>
wherein:<br>
- X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, X6, X7, X8 are each, identical or different, selected among halogen atoms and/or hydrogen atoms ;<br>
- R1, R2, R3, R4 are each, identical or different, selected among the moieties ; -OH, amino acids, -OR and -NHR and/or chlorine atom, wherein R is an alkyl moiety having 1 to 12 carbon atoms.<br>
One of the advantages of these derivatives lies in the presence of the chlorosulfonyl moiety in the molecule, as described in the present invention, which enables to introduce simply and efficiently a large variety of chemical moieties.<br>
The present invention relates, moreover, to an anticancerous and/or antiviral and/or antimicrobial medication for human or animal usage exhibiting as a main active agent one or several compounds described in the present invention.<br>
The invention will be understood better when reading the following description, accompanied by the appended drawings among which:<br>
-	Figure 1 represents the absorption spectrum of chlorin according<br>
to the formula (I) in an aqueous solution before (full line) and after (dotted line)<br>
irradiation of the sample by the second harmonic of a laser Nd : YAG;<br>
-	Figure 2 represents the absorption spectrum of bacteriochlorin<br>
according to the formula (II) in an aqueous solution before (full line) and after<br>
(dotted line) irradiation of the sample by the second harmonic of a laser Nd : YAG.<br>
The present invention relates first of all to a porphyrin derivative, in particular chlorin, of formula(Figure Removed)   <br>
-	  X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, X6, X7, X8 are each, identical or different, selected among<br>
halogen atoms and/or hydrogen atoms ;<br>
-	R1, R2, R3, R4 are each, identical or different, selected among the moieties ; -<br>
OH, amino acids, -OR and -NHR and/or chlorine atoms, wherein R is an alkyl<br>
moiety having 1 to 12 carbon atoms.<br>
One of the advantages of such type of derivatives lies in that they are amphiphile. The amphiphilic character is essential so that the molecules may cross the cellular membrane and accumulate inside the cells.<br>
By amphiphilic, is meant any molecule which exhibits both a hydrophilic and hydrophobic character.<br>
This type of derivatives exhibits an absorption band at 650 nm, as shown on Figure 1.<br>
The present invention also relates to the derivatives complying with formula (I), wherein:<br>
-	X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, X5, X7, X8 are each, identical or different, selected among<br>
halogen atoms, and/or hydrogen atoms, such that at least one of the radicals X of<br>
each pair X1/ X2, X3/ X4, X5/X6, X7/X8 is a halogen atom,<br>
An advantage of this particular type of derivatives lies in the presence of the halogen atoms in the ortho positions of the phenyl moiety which<br>
increases the quantum yield of the formation of the triplet state, without reducing significantly the lifetime thereof. With higher quantum yield, the triplet state may transfer its energy more efficiently towards oxygen with consequently higher yield in the formation of singlet oxygen.<br>
Moreover, the halogen atoms in the ortho positions of the phenyl moiety make the tetrapyrolic macrocycle more stable and, hence, more efficient in its use in photodynamic therapy.<br>
Still according to the present invention, and in compliance with formula (I) :<br>
-	X2, X4, X6 and X8 are either chlorine atoms, or fluorine atoms;<br>
-	X1, X3, X5 and X7 are hydrogen atoms,<br>
-	R1, R2, R3, R4 are chlorine atoms.<br>
According to another variation of the present invention, and in compliance with formula (I):<br>
-	X2, X4, X6 and X8 are either chlorine atoms, or fluorine atoms;<br>
-	X1, X3, X5 and X7 are hydrogen atoms,<br>
-	R1, R2, R3, R4 are-OH moieties.<br>
The present invention also relates to derivatives complying with formula (I), wherein:<br>
-	X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, X5, X7, X8 are chlorine atoms,<br>
-	R1, R2, R3, R4 are either chlorine atoms, or-OH moieties.<br>
The present invention also relates to a porphyrin derivative, in particular bacteriochlorin, of formula :<br>
(Figure Removed)   <br>
:<br>
-	X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, X6, X7, X8 are each, identical or different, selected among<br>
halogen atoms, and/or hydrogen atoms;<br>
-	R1, R2, R3, R4 are each, identical or different, selected among the moieties : -OH,<br>
amino acids, -OR and -NHR and/or chlorine atom, wherein R is an alkyl moiety<br>
having 1 to 12 carbon atoms.<br>
An advantage of such type of derivatives, and such that for the case of chlorins described above, lies in that they are also amphiphilic.<br>
Another advantage of these derivatives, in particular bacteriochlorin complying with the formula (II), consists in absorbing light in the red region at 750 nm, as illustrated on Figure 2. At such wavelength, the shielding effects caused by human tissues, in particular by hemoglobin, are not so high, which enables to increase the 'amount' of light reaching the photosensitizers inside the cells.<br>
The present invention also relates to the derivatives complying with formula (II), wherein:<br>
-	X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, X6, X7, X8 are each, identical or different, selected among<br>
halogen atoms, and/ or hydrogen atoms, such that at least one of the radicals X of<br>
each pair X1/ X2, X3/x4 X5/X6, X7/X8 is a halogen atom.<br>
As for the case of chlorin described above, the presence of the halogen atoms in the ortho positions of the phenyl moiety, increases the quantum yield of the formation of the triplet state, without reducing significantly the lifetime thereof, and consequently, also increases the increase in the formation of the singlet oxygen.<br>
The present invention also relates to certain derivatives, complying with formula (II), wherein: -X2, X4, X6 and X8 are either chlorine atoms, or fluorine atoms,<br>
-	X1, X3, X5 and X7 are hydrogen atoms,<br>
-	R1, R2, R3, R4 are chlorine atoms.<br>
According to another variation of the present invention, and in compliance with formula (II):<br>
-	X2, X4, X6 and X8 are either chlorine atoms, or fluorine atoms,<br>
-	X1, X3, X5 and X7 are hydrogen atoms,<br>
-	R1, R2, R3, R4 are-OH moieties.<br>
The present invention relates moreover to derivatives complying with formula (II), wherein: X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, X6, X7, X8 are chlorine atoms,<br>
-	R1, R2, R3, R4 are either chlorine atoms, or-OH moieties.<br>
The presence of the halogen atoms in the ortho positions of the phenyl moiety also makes the tetrapyrrolic macrocycle and its derivatives more stable.<br>
According to the present invention, the halogen atoms are fluorine and/or chlorine and/or bromine.<br>
Another aim of the present invention consists in the method of preparation of derivatives as described above including the following steps :<br>
-	a   chlorosulfonation   step   of   the   corresponding   halogenated<br>
porphyrin,<br>
-	a reducing step of the halogenated and chlorosulfonated porphyrin<br>
to chlorin and/or to bacteriochlorin with hydrazide and in the presence of organic<br>
hindered bases,<br>
-	a coupling step between the chlorosulfonated moiety and amines<br>
and/or amino acids and/or alcohols, or hydrolysing the chlorine of the<br>
chlorosulfonated moiety with water.<br>

-	X2, X4, X6 and X8 are chlorine atoms ;<br>
-	X1, X3, X5 and X7 are hydrogen atoms,<br>

Then, a solution of p-toluene sulfonyl hydrazide (5.5 x 10-5 mol) and a bulky organic base, such as DABCO and/or DBU in DMF (5ml_) was added to the reactive mixture. The mixture was stirred at 150°C under nitrogen atmosphere and in the absence of light.<br>
