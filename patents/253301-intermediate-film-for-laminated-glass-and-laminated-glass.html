DESCRIPTION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an interlayer for<br>
laminated glass and also to laminated glass, both of which<br>
allow light to pass but cannot permit the persons or<br>
objects existing behind them to be visually identified.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
There have heretofore been known opaque laminated<br>
glass, which is produced by bonding at least two<br>
transparent glass sheets with an interlayer having such an<br>
opacifier as calcium carbonate or silica dispersed in a<br>
thermoplastic resin. Such opaque laminated glass can<br>
transmit light, but cannot permit the persons or objects<br>
existing behind them to be visually identified. Therefore,<br>
the opaque laminated glass has been used in the locations<br>
where privacy protection is required to be secured,â€”such as<br>
lighting windows, bathroom doors and panels or wainscots<br>
for balconies (for example, refer to Japanese Patent<br>
Publication (examined) No. 2-56295).<br>
However, such conventional opaque laminated glass<br>
using an opacifier causes the problem that uneven coloring<br>
is likely to occur due to agglomeration or poor dispersion<br>
of particles of the opacifier. In addition, there is also<br>
created the problem that the particles of the opacifier,<br>
which are present at an interface between each glass sheet<br>
and the interlayer, impair adhesion at the interface so<br>
that fine air bubbles are likely to be formed.<br><br>
In order to solve such problems, there has been proposed<br>
an interlayer for opaque laminated glass consisting of (a) a<br>
polyvinyl acetal resin produced by acetalization of a polyvinyl<br>
alcohol having a degree of saponification of not less than 96<br>
mol% with an aldehyde having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, (b) a polyvinyl<br>
acetal resin produced by acetalization of a polyvinyl alcohol<br>
having a degree of saponification of less than 96 mol% with an<br>
aldehyde having 1 to 10 carbon atoms and (c) a plasticizer<br>
(Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 6-263489).<br>
However, opaque laminated glass described in Japanese Patent<br>
Laid-Open No. 6-263489 does not yet have a lowered visible-light<br>
transmittance suited for privacy protection, and also undergoes<br>
decreases in its transmittances for other rays or light, or<br>
impairs the proper, fundamental characteristics required of<br>
laminated glass, when an attempt is made to get its visible light<br>
transmittance decreased to a lowered level suited for privacy<br>
protection, thus being not necessarily satisfactory.<br>
Also, the laminated glass, as produced by bonding, for<br>
example, an interlayer composed of a polyvinyl butyral rein<br>
plasticized with a plasticizer, etc. between at least two<br>
transparent glass sheets has been widely used as windowpanes<br>
in automobiles and buildings , etc. Furthermore, such laminated<br>
glass offers the advantage that utilization of interlayers<br>
colored with a variety of coloring agents can facilitate the<br>
resultanttinted laminated glass to control or regulate the inner<br>
quantity of light.<br>
Laminated glass using this type of interlayers has the<br>
fundamental characteristics required of the laminated glass,<br>
such as good weatherability, satisfactory adhesion between the<br><br>
interlayer and glass sheet, reasonable resistance to penetration<br>
or piercement by objects when subjected to external impacts,<br>
and adequate resistance to shattering or shatter-proof ness when<br>
broken by external impacts, although the laminated glass<br>
encounters the problem of inferior sound-insulating property.<br>
Particularly, such laminated glass shows a reduced sound<br>
transmission loss owing to the coincidence effect in the range<br>
of middle to high frequencies of about 2,000 to 5,000 Hz, and<br>
suffers from deterioration in sound-insulating property,<br>
wherein the term "coincidence effect" is understood to refer<br>
to the phenomenon in which when a soundwave enters a glass sheet,<br>
a transverse wave is propagated on the surface of the glass sheet<br>
due to the rigidity and inertia of the glass sheet and becomes<br>
resonant with the incident sound wave, thereby causing sound<br>
transmission. The coincidence effect is shifted to a higher<br>
frequency region according as the surface density of the<br>
laminated glass is smaller, that is, the thickness of the glass<br>
sheet diminishes.<br>
In accordance with an increasingly growing demand for<br>
improved sound-insulating property, in recent years, there is<br>
required the laminated glass which can exhibit excellent<br>
sound-insulating property in addition to the fundamental<br>
characteristics as described above. Referring to an interlayer<br>
for improved sound-insulating laminated glass and such<br>
sound-insulating laminated glass, for example, Japanese Patent<br>
No. 2703471 discloses laminated glass using an interlayer for<br>
sound-insulating laminated glass of which interlayer comprises<br>
not less than at least two different plasticized polyvinyl acetal<br>
resin films being laminated.<br><br>
In order to enhance the sound-insulating property of<br>
laminated glass, however, there has been strongly demanded an<br>
interlayer for laminated glass which can attain the enhanced<br>
sound-insulating property as compared with the conventional ones.<br>
In addition, the conventional sound-insulating<br>
polyvinylacetal resin interlayers, with their increased<br>
contents of plasticizers, have caused the problem that blocking<br>
is likely to occur during storage or handling, and such<br>
sound-insulating polyvinyl acetal resin film has therefore been<br>
laminated on both sides with the polyvinyl acetal resin films<br>
with a reduced content of a plasticizer to form the three-layered<br>
film, thereby preventing the interlayer from causing blocking.<br>
The laminated glass using the conventional sound-insulating<br>
interlayers, although it has successfully prevented<br>
deterioration in the sound-insulating property as caused by the<br>
above-described coincidence effect and has exhibited excellent<br>
sound-insulating property, has confronted the problem that its<br>
sound-insulating property gets impaired in cases where it is<br>
exposed to temperature rises causedby irradiation with sunlight,<br>
etc.<br>

EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The interlayer for laminated glass and the laminated glass<br>
comprising said interlayer can exhibit excellent performance<br>
in privacy protection.<br>
(Effect of the First Invention)<br>
Laminated glass which comprises the interlayer for laminated<br>
glass according to the first invention can exhibit excellent<br>
performance in privacy protection, while it particularly<br>
exhibits a low visible light transmittance suited for privacy<br>
protection, namely a visible-light transmittance as low as not<br>
more than 2.5 %, and also shows excellent heat-shielding<br>
property.<br>
The laminated glass according to the first invention not<br>
only exhibits a low visible light transmittance suited for<br>
privacy protection, but also eliminates the problem of occurrence<br>
of uneven coloring caused by agglomeration or poor dispersion<br>
of fine-particle inorganic powder (especially the opacifier),<br>
while at the same time, it can produce the effect of preventing<br>
the problem of formation of fine air bubbles caused by a decrease<br>
in interfacial adhesion brought about by the fine-particle<br>
inorganic powder being present at the interface between the glass<br>
sheet and interlayer.<br>
On account of these, the laminated glass according to the<br><br>
first invention is suitably usable in the application fields<br>
where the privacy protection is particularly required to be<br>
ensured, among the roof and side-window panes of automobiles<br>
or panes for buildings, etc.<br>
(Effect of the Second Invention)<br>
The interlayer for laminated glass according to the second<br>
invention is composed of an opaque and sound-insulating polyvinyl<br>
acetal resin composition, and, with the fine-particle inorganic<br>
powder formulated therein, can achieve the enhanced<br>
sound-insulating property. Because the sound-insulating<br>
polyvinyl acetal resin composition is opaque, furthermore,<br>
the interlayer can yield the laminated glass with additionally<br>
excellent light-shielding property.<br>
Moreover, the resin composition contains fine-particle<br>
inorganic powder formulated therein, resulting in production<br>
of the interlayer for laminated glass with decreased<br>
self-adhesiveness in spite of its greater content of plasticizer.<br>
The interlayer for laminated glass according to the second<br>
invention, when colored with achromatic inorganic powder, can<br>
produce the effect of development of much more subdued color<br>
tone.<br>
Because the laminated glass according to the second<br>
invention is composed of the opaque and sound-insulating<br>
polyvinyl acetal resin composition having fine-particle<br>
inorganic powder formulated therein, the laminated glass<br>
produced with use of said interlayer is suitably usable in the<br>
application fields where the light-shielding property is<br>
particularly required, among the roof and side-window panes of<br>
automobiles except windshields, or panes for buildings, and the<br><br>
like. In particular, the laminated glass produced by use of<br>
the white-colored interlayer for laminated glass allows the<br>
visible light to transmit but cannot permit the persons or objects<br>
existing behind it to be visually identified, and consequently<br>
is suitably utilizable in the locations where privacy protection<br>
is particularly required to be ensured, such as lighting windows ,<br>
bathroom doors, and panels or wainscots for balconies.<br>
(Effect of the Third Invention)<br>
The interlayer for laminated glass according to the third<br>
invention comprises an opaque polyvinylacetal resin layer (A)<br>
and a transparent polyvinyl acetal resin layer (B) being<br>
laminated together, and can produce enhanced sound-insulating<br>
effect owing to the fine-particle inorganic powder formulated<br>
therein.<br>
The difference in viscoelastic property between the<br>
sound-insulating polyvinyl acetal rein layer (A) and the<br>
transparent polyvinyl acetal resin layer (B) can permit sound<br>
energy to be effectively converted and absorbed into heat energy<br>
on account of the internal friction effect between the two resin<br>
layers, and the sound-insulating property can be prevented from<br>
deterioration caused by the coincidence effect at the middle<br>
to high frequencies of about 2,000 to 5,000 Hz.<br>
The interlayer, in which the sound-insulating polyvinyl<br>
acetal resin layer is opaque, can provide the laminated glass<br>
with excellent light-shielding property.<br>
The interlayer for laminated glass according to the third<br>
invention , when colored with achromatic inorganic fine particles ,<br>
can produce the effect of development of much more subdued color<br>
tone.<br><br>
Since the interlayer for laminated glass is composed of<br>
the sound-insulating polyvinyl acetal resin layer containing<br>
fine-particle inorganic powder, the laminated glass produced<br>
with use of said interlayer is suitably usable in the application<br>
fields where the light-shielding property is particularly<br>
required, among the roof and side-window panes of automobiles<br>
except windshields, or panes for buildings. In particular, the<br>
laminated glass produced by use of the white-colored interlayer<br>
for laminated glass allows the transmittance of visible light<br>
but cannot permit the persons or objects existing behind it to<br>
be visually identified, and consequently is suitably utilizable<br>
in the locations where privacy protection is particularly<br>
required to be ensured, such as lighting windows, bathroom doors,<br>
and panels or wainscots for balconies.<br>
(Effect of the Fourth Invention)<br>
Since the interlayer for laminated glass according to the<br>
fourth invention comprises the above-described<br>
sound-insulating polyvinyl acetal resin layer and opaque<br>
polyvinylacetal resin layer being laminated together, and<br>
shows excellent light-shielding property, the laminated glass<br>
produced by use of the interlayer can cut off through absorption<br>
or reflectance the infrared radiation (heat-ray) with<br>
particularly great thermal effect among the rays of light<br>
entering through the laminated glass originating from sunlight,<br>
etc., while it suppresses temperature rises in the<br>
sound-insulating polyvinyl acetal resin layer and also<br>
temperature rises in the inside of automobiles and rooms of<br>
buildings, and this can securedly prevent temperature rises in<br>
the sound-insulating interlayer for laminated glass and<br><br>
therefore the deterioration in sound-insulating property, as<br>
well.<br>
The interlayer for laminated glass according to the fourth<br>
invention, which utilizes the tinted layer colored with<br>
inorganic fine particles, exhibits excellent weatherability and<br>
is resistant to deterioration in terms of such optical<br>
characteristics as Haze value, physical strength of the<br>
interlayer, etc.<br>
The interlayer for laminated glass according to the fourth<br>
invention, which utilizes the tinted layer colored with<br>
achromatic inorganic fine particles, can produce the effect of<br>
development of much more subdued color tone.<br>
Because the interlayer for laminated glass according to<br>
the fourth invention comprises the opaque polyvinyl acetal resin<br>
layer being laminated, the laminated glass produced by use of<br>
such interlayer is suitably usable in the application fields<br>
where the light-shielding property is particularly required,<br>
among the roof and side-window panes of automobiles except<br>
windshields, or panes for buildings. In particular, the<br>
laminated glass produced by use of the white-colored interlayer<br>
for laminated glass allows the transmittance of visible light<br>
but cannot permit the persons or objects existing behind it to<br>
be visually identified, and consequently is suitably utilizable<br>
in the locations where privacy protection is particularly<br>
required to be ensured, such as lighting windows , bathroom doors,<br>
and panels or wainscots for balconies.<br>
In cases where the laminated glass according to the fourth<br>
invention is used for automobiles and buildings in the places<br>
or spots in contact with the outdoor environment, the interlayer<br><br>
for laminated glass according to the fourth invention desirably<br>
has the laminate construction in which the above-mentioned opaque<br>
polyvinyl acetal resin layer is so arranged as to be on the outdoor<br>
side.<br>
When the interlayer for laminated glass according to the<br>
fourth invention comprises the conventionally known<br>
sound-insulating polyvinyl acetal resin layer, especially two<br>
kinds of plasticized polyvinyl acetal resin layers being<br>
laminated as a sound-insulating polyvinyl acetal resin layer,<br>
the internal friction effect between two of the respective resin<br>
layers having different viscoelastic properties can permit sound<br>
energy to be effectively converted and absorbed into heat energy,<br>
and the sound-insulating property can be prevented from<br>
deterioration caused by the coincidence effect at the middle<br>
to high frequencies of about 2,000 to 5,000 Hz.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The interlayer for laminated glass of the present invention<br>
is characterized in that said interlayer comprises at least one<br>
layer composed of an opaque EVA resin composition or an opaque<br>
polyvinyl acetal resin composition.<br>
(Opaque EVA Resin Composition)<br>
The opaque EVA resin composition to be used in the present<br>
invention can be produced by mixing and dispersing an appropriate<br>
amount of fine-particle inorganic powder in an EVA resin.<br>
The EVA resin is a non-crosslinked ethylene-vinyl acetate<br>
copolymer resin or a high-temperature crosslinked ethylene-<br>
vinyl acetate copolymer resin. As the EVA resin, use can be<br>
made of modified ethylene-vinyl acetate resins, such as<br><br>
saponified ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers. To produce a<br>
variety of such EVA resins as mentioned above, there can be adopted<br>
the conventionally known methods.<br>
The ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers (EVA) show a<br>
vinyl-acetate content of 20 to 40wt% as measured in accordance<br>
with JISK6730 "Testing Methods for Ethylene/Vinyl Acetate Resin<br>
Materials " . When the vinyl acetate content is less than 20 wt%,<br>
the resultant interlayer is so hard that its adhesion to a glass<br>
sheet is impaired, while the laminated glass produced exhibits<br>
deteriorated penetration resistance. When the vinyl-acetate<br>
content exceeds 40 wt%, on the other hand, the resultant<br>
interlayer has poor breaking strength so that the laminated glass<br>
produced shows inferior impact resistance.<br>
As examples of the fine-particle inorganic powder to be<br>
used for producing the EVA resin composition, there may be<br>
mentioned calcium carbonate, alumina, kaolin clay, calcium<br>
silicate, magnesium oxide, magnesium hydroxide, aluminum<br>
hydroxide, magnesium carbonate, talc, feldspar powder, mica,<br>
baryte. barium carbonate, titanium oxide, silica, and glass beads .<br>
Such fine-particle inorganic powder may be used singly or as<br>
mixtures of two or more thereof. It is to be noted that the<br>
above-mentioned fine-particle inorganic powder is preferably<br>
opacifiers, more preferably calcium carbonate or silica, most<br>
preferably calcium carbonate.<br>
The fine-particle inorganic powder to be used for producing<br>
the EVA resin compositions preferably have an average particle<br>
size in the range of 0.1 to 100 Âµm, more preferably in the range<br>
of 0.1 to 50 Âµm. The average particle sizes of the fine-particle<br>
inorganic powder can be measured by the dynamic light scattering<br><br>
inmethod usg a light scattering instrument (e.g. , "DLS-6000AL"<br>
manufactured by Otsuka Electronics Co., Ltd. ) and an Ar laser<br>
as a light source. The above-mentioned fine-particle inorganic<br>
powder is generally used at ratios in the range of 0.3 to 30<br>
parts by weight, preferably in the range of 0.5 to 20 parts by<br>
weight, per 100 parts by weight of the EVA resin, so that the<br>
opaque EVA resin compositions may be produced.<br>
(Opaque Polyvinyl Acetal Resin Composition)<br>
The above-mentioned opaque polyvinyl acetal resin<br>
composition can be usually produced by mixing and dispersing<br>
an appropriate amount of each of a plasticizer and fine-particle<br>
inorganic powder in a polyvinyl acetal resin. The opaque<br>
polyvinyl acetal resin composition may be, but is not<br>
specifically limited to, any one obtained by mixing and<br>
dispersing an appropriate amount of fine-particle inorganic<br>
powder in a polyvinyl acetal resin composition containing for<br>
example not less than 45 parts by weight of a plasticizer per<br>
100 parts by weight of a known polyvinyl acetal resin as used<br>
conventionally for an interlayer for sound-insulating laminated<br>
glass. Namely, the opaque polyvinyl acetal resin composition<br>
may be any polyvinyl acetal resin compositions containing<br>
fine-particle inorganic powder and not less than 45 parts by<br>
weight of a plasticizer per 100 parts by weight of a polyvinyl<br>
acetal resin.<br>
The plasticizer to be used for producing the polyvinyl acetal<br>
resin composition is not particularly limited, and<br>
conventionally known plasticizers generally used for producing<br>
this type of interlayers can be used. Preferred examples of<br>
such plasticizers include triethylene<br><br>
glycol-di-2-ethylbutyrate (3GH), triethylene glycol-di-2-<br>
ethylhexanoate (3GO) , triethylene glycol-di-n-heptanoate (3G7),<br>
tetraethyleneglycol-di-2-ethylhexanoate (4G0), tetraethylene<br>
glycol-di-n-heptanoate (4G7), and oligoethylene glycol-di-2-<br>
ethylhexanoate (NGO), etc. Such plasticizers are generally<br>
used at ratios in the range of 25 to 70 parts by weight per 100<br>
parts by weight of the polyvinyl acetal resin.<br>
The fine-particle inorganic powder to be used for producing<br>
the above-mentioned opaque polyvinyl acetal resin composition<br>
may be the same as those described above for producing the opaque<br>
EVA resin compositions.<br>
The fine-particle inorganic powder is generally used at<br>
ratios in the range of 0.3 to 30 parts by weight, preferably<br>
in the range of 0.5 to 20 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight<br>
of the polyvinyl acetal resin so that the opaque polyvinylacetal<br>
resin film may be produced.<br>
Particularly, the above-mentioned opaque polyvinyl acetal<br>
resin composition is easy to be obtained in the subdued color<br>
tone, since most of the above-mentioned fine-particle inorganic<br>
powder is achromatic (white, light gray, gray, blackish gray,<br>
black).<br>
(Optional components)<br>
The above-mentioned opaque EVA resin composition or opaque<br>
polyvinyl acetal resin composition may further be admixed with<br>
light shielding agents, a variety of coloring agents (e.g.,<br>
pigments or dyes), etc., as the case may be.<br>
Examples of the light shielding agents include carbon black,<br>
red iron oxide, and the like. As the coloring agents, pigments<br>
are preferably used, and examples of such pigments include a<br><br>
dark red-brown mixed pigment produced by mixing four pigments,<br>
i. e. a black pigment of carbon black, a red pigment of C. I. Pigment<br>
red, a blue pigment of C.I.Pigment blue, and a yellow pigment<br>
of C.I.Pigment yellow.<br>
Furthermore, the above-mentioned opaque EVA resin<br>
composition or the opaque polyvinyl acetal resin composition<br>
may be incorporated with various additives generally used for<br>
producing this type of interlayers, such as UV absorbers,<br>
antioxidants, adhesion regulating agents, plasticizers, and the<br>
like, as the case may be.<br>
Preferred examples of the UV absorber include<br>
2-(2'-hydroxy-5'-methylphenyl)benzotriazole (e.g., "TINUVIN<br>
P" manufactured by CIBA-GEIGY Co.), 2- (2' -hydroxy-3 ', 5 ' -di-t-<br>
methylphenyl)benzotriazole (e.g., "TINUVIN 320" manufactured<br>
by CIBA-GEIGY Co.), 2-(2'-hydroxy-3'-t-butyl-5'-methyl-<br>
phenyl)-5-chlorobenzotriazole (e.g., "TINUVIN 326"<br>
manufactured by CIBA-GEIGY Co.), and 2-(2'-hydroxy-<br>
s' , 5 ' -di-amylphenyl) -benzotriazole (e.g., "TINUVIN 328"<br>
manufactured by CIBA-GEIGY Co.) . Alternatively, hindered amine<br>
light stabilizers such as "ADEKA STAB LA-57" manufactured by<br>
Adeka Argus Co.) is also preferable.<br>
Preferred examples of the antioxidant include t-butyl<br>
hydroxy toluene (e.g. , "Sumilizer BHT" manufactured by Sumitomo<br>
Chemical Co.) and tetrakis-[methylene-3-(3',5'-di-t-butyl-4'-<br>
hydroxyphenyl)propionate]methane (e.g., "IRGANOX 1010"<br>
manufactured by CIBA-GEIGY Co.).<br>
Preferred examples of the adhesion regulating agent include<br>
alkali metal salts or alkaline earth metal salts of organic or<br>
inorganic acids.<br><br>
Examples of the plasticizer to be used for the<br>
above-mentioned EVA resin composition include, for example,<br>
phthalic acid esters such as dioctyl phthalate (DOP), dibutyl<br>
phthalate (DBP) and diisodecyl phthalate (DIDP); adipic acid<br>
esters such as di-2-ethylhexyl adipate (DOA) and diisodecyl<br>
adipate (DIDA); sebacic acid esters such as dibutyl sebacate<br>
(DBS) and di-2-ethylhexyl sebacate (DOS); phosphoric acid esters<br>
such as tricresyl phosphate (TCP) and trioctyl phosphate (TOP) ;<br>
and epoxidized soybean oil.<br>
The interlayer for laminated glass of the present invention<br>
is not particularly limited, as long as it is composed of the<br>
above-mentioned opaque EVA resin composition or opaque polyvinyl<br>
acetal resin composition, and may comprise a single layer or<br>
multiple layers . In the case of the multiple layers, for example,<br>
a layer composed of the above-mentioned opaque EVA resin<br>
composition or polyvinyl acetal resin composition may<br>
furthermore be laminated with a plural number of layers composed<br>
of EVA resin compositions or polyvinyl acetal resin compositions<br>
each having the same or different composition and miscellaneous<br>
opaque resin compositions, or may be laminated with layers<br>
composed of, for example, transparent resin compositions or<br>
sound-insulating resin compositions.<br>
Taking into consideration the minimum magnitudes of<br>
penetration resistance and weatherability required of the<br>
laminated glass, the interlayer for laminated glass according<br>
to the present invention preferably shows a total film thickness<br>
in the range of 0.3 to 1.6 mm for practical reasons, as is the<br>
same with the conventional transparent interlayers for laminated<br>
glass.<br><br>
The interlayer for laminated glass composed of the<br>
above-mentioned opaque EVA resin composition or the opaque<br>
polyvinyl acetal resin composition can be produced by kneading<br>
(I) the above-mentioned EVA resin and the above-mentioned<br>
fine-particle inorganic powder, as well as a variety of<br>
additives to be added if required, or (II) the above-mentioned<br>
polyvinyl acetal resin composition, the above-mentioned<br>
plasticizer and the above-mentioned fine-particle inorganic<br>
powder, as well as a variety of additives to be added if required,<br>
with an extruder, a plastograph, a kneader, a banbury mixer,<br>
or a calender roll, etc., followed by film-forming into the sheet<br>
form by the conventional film forming processes, such as the<br>
extrusion, calendering and press processes.<br>
The laminated glass of the present invention can be produced<br>
using the same process as used for producing the conventional<br>
laminated glass. For example, the laminated glass can be<br>
manufactured , by sandwitching the above-described interlayer<br>
for laminated glass between at least two transparent glass sheets ,<br>
passing them through pressure rolls or placing them in a rubber<br>
bag, followed by vacuum suction, to give a laminated body through<br>
the preliminary bonding of the interlayer with the glass sheets<br>
at about 70 to 110Â°C, while removing the air remaining between<br>
the glass sheet and the interlayer and placing the deaerated<br>
laminated body in an autoclave or subjecting it to pressing to<br>
carry out the final bonding at about 120 to 150Â°C under applied<br>
pressure of about 1 to 1.5 MPa.<br>
It is to be noted that the transparent glass sheets to be<br>
used in the present invention are not particularly limited, and<br>
that any transparent glass sheets generally used can be used.<br><br>
Examples of such transparent glass sheets include various kinds<br>
of inorganic glass sheets such as float plate glass sheets,<br>
heat-absorbing glass sheets, polished glass sheets, template<br>
glass sheets, wire plate glass sheets, and line plate glass<br>
sheets, and organic glass sheets such as polycarbonate sheets<br>
and polymethyl methacrylate sheets. These glass sheets may be<br>
used singly or in combination of two or more thereof. Among<br>
them, heat-absorbing glass sheets are preferably used. It is<br>
to be noted that the thickness of such glass sheets is not<br>
particularly 1 imited and can be appropriately selected according<br>
to their intended use, although it is desirably in the range<br>
of 1 to 3 mm.<br>
The thus obtained laminated glass of the present invention<br>
has a low visible light transmittance suitable for privacy<br>
protection.<br>
(The First Invention)<br>
To be described below is the first invention as a preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
An interlayer for laminated glass of the first invention<br>
is characterized in that said interlayer is composed of an opaque<br>
EVA resin composition containing fine -particle inorganic powder<br>
and heat-ray shielding fine particles.<br>
In the first invention, such an opaque EVA resin composition<br>
can be obtained by mixing and dispersing an appropriate amount<br>
of each of the above-mentioned fine-particle inorganic powder<br>
and heat-ray shielding fine particles in the above-described<br>
EVA resin. Examples of the fine-particle inorganic powder to<br>
be used in the first invention include calcium carbonate, alumina,<br>
kaolin clay, calcium silicate, magnesium oxide, magnesium<br><br>
hydroxide, aluminum hydroxide, magnesium carbonate, talc,<br>
feldspar powder, mica, baryte, barium carbonate, titanium oxide,<br>
silica, and glass beads, etc. These may be used singly or as<br>
mixtures of two or more thereof. It is to be noted that the<br>
above-mentioned fine-particle inorganic powder is preferably<br>
opacifiers, more preferably calcium carbonate or silica, most<br>
preferably calcium carbonate.<br>
Examples of the heat-ray shielding fine particles to be<br>
used in the first invention include tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) ,<br>
antimony-doped tin oxide (ATO), aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) ,<br>
indium-doped zinc oxide (IZO), tin-doped zinc oxide,<br>
silicon-doped zinc oxide, zinc antimonate, lanthanum hexaboride,<br>
cerium hexaboride, fine gold powder, fine silver powder, fine<br>
platinum powder, and fine aluminum powder. Among them, ITO is<br>
preferable.<br>
The average particle sizes of the fine-particle inorganic<br>
powder and the heat-ray shielding fine particles to be used in<br>
the first invention are preferably in the range of 0.1 to 100<br>
Âµm, more preferably in the range of 0.1 to 50 Âµm. These average<br>
particle sizes can be measured by the dynamic light scattering<br>
method using a light scattering instrument (e.g. , "DLS-6000AL"<br>
manufactured by Otsuka Electronics) and an Ar laser as a light<br>
source. The above-mentioned fine-particle inorganic powder is<br>
generally used at ratios in the range of 0.3 to 30 parts by weight,<br>
preferably in the range of 0.5 to 20 parts by weight, per 100<br>
parts by weight of the EVA resin so that the opaque EVA resin<br>
composition may be produced. The above-mentioned heat-ray<br>
shielding fine particles are usually used at ratios in the range<br>
of 0.001 to 30 parts by weight, preferably in the range of 0.001<br><br>
to 10 parts by weight, more preferably in the range of 0.005<br>
to 5 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the EVA resin.<br>
It is to be noted that when the fine-particle inorganic<br>
powder to be used in the first invention is calcium carbonate,<br>
the average particle size of said inorganic powder is preferably<br>
in the range of 0.5 to 10 Âµm, and the calcium carbonate content<br>
in the interlayer for laminated glass preferably is in such a<br>
range as may satisfy the following equation (1), more preferably<br>
the following equation (2).<br>
Equation (1):<br>
Calcium carbonate content in the interlayer (wt%) x<br>
thickness of the interlayer (mm) = 1.0 to 3.0,<br>
Equation (2):<br>
Calcium carbonate content in the interlayer (wt%) x<br>
thickness of the interlayer (mm) = 1.5 to 2.5<br>
Particularly, the above-mentioned opaque EVA resin<br>
composition is easy to be obtained in the subdued color tone,<br>
since most of the fine-particle inorganic powder is achromatic<br>
(white, light gray, gray, blackish gray, black).<br>
The above-mentioned opaque EVA resin composition may further<br>
be incorporated with light shielding agents, coloring agents<br>
(e.g., pigments or dyes), etc., as the case may be.<br>
Furthermore, the above-mentioned opaque EVA resin<br>
composition may be incorporated with a variety of additives<br>
generally used for producing this type of interlayers, such as<br>
UV absorbers, antioxidants, adhesion regulating agents, and<br>
plasticizers, as the case may be.<br>
The interlayer for laminated glass according to the first<br>
invention of the present invention is not particularly limited.<br><br>
only if it is composed of the above-mentioned opaque EVA resin<br>
composition, and may comprise a single layer or multiple layers .<br>
In the case of multiple layers, for example, a layer composed<br>
of the above-mentioned opaque EVA resin composition may be<br>
laminated with a plural number of layers composed of EVA resin<br>
compositions or miscellaneous opaque resin compositions each<br>
having a different composition, or layers comprising transparent<br>
resin compositions or sound-insulating resin compositions.<br>
Taking into consideration the minimum levels or magnitudes<br>
of penetration resistance and weatherability required of the<br>
laminated glass, the interlayer for laminated glass according<br>
to the present invention preferably shows a total film thickness<br>
in the range of 0.3 to 1.6 mm for practical reasons, as is the<br>
same with the conventional transparent interlayers for laminated<br>
glass.<br>
The interlayer for laminated glass composed of the<br>
above-mentioned opaque EVA resin composition or opaque polyvinyl<br>
acetal resin composition can be produced by kneading the<br>
above-mentioned EVA resin, the above-mentioned fine-particle<br>
inorganic powder, and various additives to be added as the case<br>
maybe, with an extruder, a plastograph, a kneader, a banbury<br>
mixer, or a calender roll, followed by film-forming into the<br>
sheet form by the conventional film forming process, such as<br>
the extrusion, calendering and press processes.<br>
The laminated glass of the first invention can be produced<br>
using the same process as used for producing the conventional<br>
laminated glass. For example, the laminated glass can be<br>
manufactured by sandwitching the above-de scribed interlayer for<br>
laminated glass between at least two transparent glass sheets.<br><br>
passing them through pressure rolls or placing them in a rubber<br>
bag, followed by vacuum suction, to give a laminated body through<br>
the preliminary bonding of the interlayer with the glass sheets<br>
at about 70 to 110Â°C, while removing the air remaining between<br>
the glass sheet and the interlayer, and placing the deaerated<br>
laminated body in an autoclave or subjecting the same to pressing<br>
to carrying out the final bonding at about 120 to 150Â°C under<br>
applied pressure of about 1 to 1.5 MPa.<br>
It is to be noted that the transparent glass sheets to be<br>
used in the present invention are not particularly limited, and<br>
that any transparent glass sheets generally used can be used.<br>
Examples of such transparent glass sheets include various kinds<br>
of inorganic glass sheets such as float plate glass sheets,<br>
heat-absorbing glass sheets, polished glass sheets, template<br>
glass sheets, wire plate glass sheets, and line plate glass<br>
sheets, and organic glass sheets such as polycarbonate plates<br>
or sheets and polymethyl methacrylate plates or sheets. These<br>
glass sheets may be used singly or in combination of two or more<br>
thereof. Among them, heat-absorbing glass sheets are<br>
preferably used. It is to be noted that the thickness of glass<br>
sheets is not particularly limited and can be appropriately<br>
selected according to their intended use, although it is<br>
desirably in the range of 1 to 3 mm per glass sheet.<br>
The thus produced laminated glass of the first invention<br>
has a low visible light transmittance suited for privacy<br>
protection, namely a visible light transmittance of not more<br>
than 2.5 %, and furthermore not more than 2 %. Additionally,<br>
the laminated glass do neither encounter the problem of uneven<br>
coloring caused by agglomeration or poor dispersion of<br><br>
fine-particle inorganic powder (especially opacifier) nor<br>
create the problem of formation of fine air bubbles caused by-<br>
deteriorated interface adhesion due to the fine-particle<br>
inorganic powder (especially opacifier) present at the interface<br>
between the glass sheet and the interlayer.<br>
(The Second Invention)<br>
To be described below is the second invention as a preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The interlayer for laminated glass according to the second<br>
invention is characterized in that said interlayer is composed<br>
of an opaque and sound-insulating polyvinyl acetal resin<br>
composition containing fine-particle inorganic powder.<br>
The interlayer for laminated glass according to the second<br>
invention is characterized in that the opaque and<br>
sound-insulating polyvinyl acetal resin composition further<br>
contains heat-ray shielding fine particles.<br>
In the second invention, such opaque and sound-insulating<br>
polyvinyl acetal resin composition can be produced by mixing<br>
and dispersing an appropriate amount of each of a plasticizer<br>
and fine-particle inorganic powder in a polyvinyl acetal resin.<br>
The polyvinyl acetal resin composition is not limited<br>
particularly, and an appropriate amount of fine-particle<br>
inorganic powder may be dispersed through mixing in a known<br>
sound-insulating polyvinyl acetal resin composition being<br>
conventionally used as an interlayer for sound-insulating<br>
laminated glass, for example, a polyvinyl acetal resin<br>
composition containing not less than 45 parts by weight of a<br>
plasticizer per 100 parts by weight of polyvinyl acetal resin.<br>
Namely, the opaque and sound-insulating polyvinyl acetal resin<br><br>
composition may be a polyvinyl acetal resin composition<br>
containing fine-particle inorganic powder and not less than 45<br>
parts by weight of a plasticizer per 100 parts by weight of<br>
polyvinyl acetal resin.<br>
It is to be noted that the interlayer for laminated glass<br>
according to the second invention may be laminated with a plural<br>
number of layers of an opaque and sound-insulating polyvinyl<br>
acetal resin composition having a different composition. In<br>
this case, sound energy is effectively converted and absorbed<br>
into heat energy due to the internal friction effect between<br>
the two resin layers having different viscoelastic properties,<br>
and particularly, the sound-insulating property can be prevented<br>
from deterioration caused by the coincidence effect at the middle<br>
to high frequencies of about 2,000 to 5,000 Hz.<br>
The opaque and sound-insulating polyvinyl acetal resin<br>
composition according to the second invention may further be<br>
admixed with heat-ray shielding fine particles, as the case may<br>
be.<br>
The laminated glass having transparent glass sheets bonded<br>
to both sides of the thus obtained interlayer for laminated glass<br>
preferably shows a haze value of not less than 20%, particularly<br>
preferably not less than 50%, more preferably not less than 60%.<br>
When the haze value of the laminated glass is less than 20%,<br>
scattering of visible light diminishes, thereby impairing the<br>
light shielding property of the laminated glass.<br>
Examples of the fine-particle inorganic powder to be used<br>
in the second invention include calcium carbonate, alumina,<br>
kaolin clay, calcium silicate, magnesium oxide, magnesium<br>
hydroxide, aluminum hydroxide, magnesium carbonate, talc.<br><br>
feldspar powder, mica, baryte, barium carbonate, titanium oxide,<br>
silica, and glass beads, and thesemay be usedsinglyor as mixtures<br>
thereof.<br>
Examples of the heat-ray shielding fine particles to be<br>
used in the second invention include tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) ,<br>
antimony-doped tin oxide (ATO), aluminum-doped zinc oxide<br>
(AZO), indium-doped zinc oxide (IZO), tin-doped zinc oxide,<br>
silicon-doped zinc oxide, zinc antimonate, lanthanumhexaboride,<br>
cerium hexaboride, fine gold powder, fine silver powder, fine<br>
platinum powder, and fine aluminum powder.<br>
The average particle size of the fine-particle inorganic<br>
powder or the heat-ray shielding fine particles to be used in<br>
the second invention are preferably in the range of 1 to 100<br>
Âµm, more preferably in the range of 1 to 50 Âµm. These average<br>
particle sizes can be measured by the dynamic light scattering<br>
method using a light scattering instrument (e.g. , "DLS-6000AL"<br>
manufactured by Otsuka Electronics) and an Ar laser as a light<br>
source. The fine-particle inorganic powder is generally used<br>
at ratios in the range of 0.3 to 30 parts by weight, preferably<br>
in the range of 0.5 to 20 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight<br>
of the polyvinyl acetal resin, so that the opaque polyvinyl acetal<br>
resin film may be produced. The heat-ray shielding fine<br>
particles are usually used at ratios in the range of 0.001 to<br>
30 parts by weight, preferably in the range of 0.001 to 10 parts<br>
by weight, more preferably in the range of 0.005 to 5 parts by<br>
weight, per 100 parts by weight of the polyvinyl acetal resin.<br>
Particularly, the opaque and sound-insulating polyvinyl<br>
acetal resin composition to be used in the second invention is<br>
easy to be obtained in the subdued color tone, since many of<br><br>
the fine-particle inorganic powder is achromatic (white, light<br>
gray, gray, blackish gray, black).<br>
Taking into consideration the minimum levels or magnitudes<br>
of penetration resistance and weatherability required of the<br>
laminated glass, the interlayer for laminated glass according<br>
to the second invention preferably shows a total film thickness<br>
in the range of 0.3 to 1.6 mm for practical reasons, as is the<br>
same with the conventional transparent interlayers for laminated<br>
glass.<br>
The opaque and sound-insulating polyvinyl acetal resin<br>
composition can be produced by kneading the above-mentioned<br>
polyvinyl acetal resin, the above-mentioned plasticizer and a<br>
variety of additives to be added, as the case may be, with an<br>
extruder, a plastograph, akneader, a banbury mixer or a calender<br>
roll, followed by film-forming by the conventional film forming<br>
process, such as the extrusion, calendering and press processes.<br>
The laminated glass of the second invention can be produced<br>
using the same process as used for producing the conventional<br>
laminated glass, for example, by sandwitching the<br>
above-de scribed interlayer for laminated glass between at least<br>
two transparent glass sheets, passing them through pressure<br>
rolls or placing them in a rubber bag, followed by vacuum suction<br>
to give a laminated body through the preliminary bonding of the<br>
interlayer with the glass sheets at about 70 to 110Â°C, while<br>
removing the air remaining between each glass sheet and the<br>
interlayer, and placing the deaerated laminated body in an<br>
autoclave or subjecting the same to pressing to carry out the<br>
final bonding at about 120 to 150Â°C under applied pressure of<br>
about 1 to 1.5 MPa.<br><br>
It is to be noted that the transparent glass sheets to be<br>
used in the second invention are not particularly limited, and<br>
that any transparent glass sheets generally used can be used.<br>
Examples of such transparent glass sheets include various kinds<br>
of inorganic glass sheets such as float plate glass sheets,<br>
heat-absorbing glass sheets, polished glass sheets, template<br>
glass sheets, wire plate glass sheets, and line plate glass sheets,<br>
and various organic glass plates or sheets such as polycarbonate<br>
plates and polymethyl methacrylate plates. These glass sheets<br>
may be used singly or in combination of two or more thereof.<br>
Among them, heat-absorbing glass sheets are preferably used.<br>
It is to be noted that the thickness of each glass sheet to be<br>
used in the second invention is not particularly limited and<br>
can be appropriately selected according to their intended use,<br>
although it is desirably in the range of 1 to 3 mm.<br>
(The Third Invention)<br>
The interlayer for laminated glass according to the third<br>
invention is characterized in that said interlayer comprises<br>
a laminate structure of at least two layers consisting of an<br>
opaque and sound-insulating polyvinyl acetal resin layer(A)<br>
containing fine-particle inorganic powder and a transparent<br>
polyvinyl acetal resin layer (B).<br>
In the third invention, a polyvinyl acetal resin to be used<br>
for the opaque and sound-insulating polyvinyl acetal resin layer<br>
(A) is not particularly limited, and although use can be made<br>
of any polyvinyl acetal resins used for producing a known<br>
sound-insulating polyvinyl acetal resin films conventionally<br>
used as an interlayer for sound-insulating laminated glass,<br>
particularly, the polyvinyl acetal resin, which is used for a<br><br>
sound-insulating polyvinyl acetal resin layer, as described in<br>
Japanese Patent No. 2703471, is preferably used.<br>
Namely, use is preferably made of polyvinyl acetal resins<br>
(a) with a vinyl acetate content (residual acetyl groups) of<br>
8 to 30 mol% obtained by acetalization of a polyvinyl alcohol<br>
with an aldehyde having 4 to 6 carbon atoms.<br>
The opaque and sound- insulating polyvinyl acetal resin layer<br>
(A) to be used in the third invention may be composed of an opaque<br>
and sound-insulating polyvinyl acetal resin composition, which<br>
polyvinyl acetal resin composition may be any polyvinyl acetal<br>
resin compositions containing fine-particle inorganic powder<br>
and 45 parts by weight or more of a plasticizer per 100 parts<br>
by weight of a polyvinyl acetal resin.<br>
The opaque and sound-insulating polyvinyl acetal resin layer<br>
(A) to be used in the third invention can be produced by furthermore<br>
mixing and dispersing at least an appropriate amount of<br>
fine-particle inorganic powder in the resin composition<br>
containing the polyvinyl acetal resin as described above and<br>
a plasticizer. In addition to the plasticizer and the<br>
fine-particle inorganic powder, heat-ray shielding fine<br>
particles, light shielding agents, UV absorbers, dyes, pigments,<br>
etc. may be added, as the case may be.<br>
It is to be noted that the resin layer (A) may be formed<br>
by the lamination of a plural number of thin films . For example,<br>
use of the laminate, which comprises the interlayer for laminated<br>
glass according to the third invention being laminated with<br>
layers of the known sound-insulating polyvinyl acetal resin,<br>
especially two kinds of plasticized polyvinyl acetal resins,<br>
being used as a sound-insulating polyvinyl acetal resin layer.<br><br>
can allow the sound energy to be effectively converted and<br>
absorbed into the heat energy due to the internal friction effect<br>
produced between resin layers having different viscoelastic<br>
properties, and particularly permits the sound-insulating<br>
property to be prevented from deterioration due to the<br>
coincidence effect in the middle to high sound region at 2,000<br>
to 5,000 Hz.<br>
In the third invention, an opaque polyvinyl acetal resin<br>
layer may be produced by mixing and dispersing an appropriate<br>
amount each of a plasticizer and fine-particle inorganic powder<br>
in a sound-insulating polyvinyl acetal resin. The polyvinyl<br>
acetal resin layer (A) may be composed of any opaque polyvinyl<br>
acetal resins being further admixed with heat-ray shielding fine<br>
particles , light shielding agents , a variety of dyes and pigments ,<br>
etc.<br>
In the third invention, a laminate construction consisting<br>
of at least two layers of an opaque and sound-insulating polyvinyl<br>
acetal resin layer (A) and a transparent polyvinyl acetal resin<br>
layer (B) is utilized as an interlayer for laminated glass.<br>
The construction of the transparent polyvinyl acetal resin<br>
layer (B) is not particularly limited, and is exemplified by<br>
a polyvinyl acetal resin layer composed of a resin composition<br>
having an appropriate amount of a plasticizer dispersed through<br>
mixing in a known polyvinyl acetal resin conventionally used<br>
as an interlayer for laminated glass. Particularly, use is<br>
desirably made of a transparent polyvinyl acetal resin layer<br>
(B) composed of a polyvinyl acetal resin (b) with a vinyl acetate<br>
content (residual acetyl groups ) of not more than 14 mol% produced<br>
by acetalization of a polyvinyl alcohol with an aldehyde having<br><br>
3 to 4 carbon atoms and a plasticizer. The resin composition<br>
constituting the polyvinyl acetal resin layer (B) may be<br>
furthermore admixed with heat-ray shielding fine particles, a<br>
variety of dyes and pigments, etc., as the case may be.<br>
The interlayer for laminated glass of the third invention<br>
comprises the resin layer (A) and resin layer (B) as the essential<br>
components, whereby a layer (C) of a resin other than polyvinyl<br>
acetal resins may be laminated therebetween, as the case may<br>
be. Examples of such resin layer (C) include layers of resins,<br>
such as polyester, polyurethane and ethylene vinyl acetate<br>
resins.<br>
The order of stacking these resin layers (A), (B) and (C)<br>
which constitute the interlayer for laminated glass according<br>
to the third invention is not particularly limited, but these<br>
resin layers are preferably stacked in such a manner that the<br>
resin layer" (A) may constitute an intermediate layer, while at<br>
least one resin layer (B) may make up the outermost surface layer,<br>
whereby use can be made of any arbitrary constructions, such<br>
as(B)/(A)/(B), (B)/(A), (B) /(C)/(A)/(B), (B)/(C)/(A)/(C)/(B),<br>
and the like. From the viewpoint of secured ease of handling,<br>
preferred is the interlayer for laminated glass having the<br>
construction in which the resin layer (B) makes up the outermost<br>
layer.<br>
The laminated glass produced by bonding transparent glass<br>
sheets to both sides of the thus obtained interlayer for laminated<br>
glass desirably shows a haze value of not less than 20%,<br>
particularly preferably not less than 50% , more preferably not<br>
less than 60%. When the haze value of the laminated glass falls<br>
beneath 20%, scattering of visible light diminishes, thereby<br><br>
impairing the light shielding property of the laminated glass.<br>
Examples of the fine-particle inorganic powder to be used<br>
in the third invention include calcium carbonate, alumina, kaolin<br>
clay, calcium silicate, magnesium oxide, magnesium hydroxide,<br>
aluminum hydroxide, magnesium carbonate, talc, feldspar powder,<br>
mica, baryta-, barium carbonate, titanium oxide, silica, and<br>
glass beads. These fine-particle inorganic powder may be used<br>
singly or in combination of two or more of them.<br>
Examples of the heat-ray shielding fine particles to be<br>
used in the third invention include tin-doped indium oxide (ITO),<br>
antimony-doped tin oxide (ATO), aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO),<br>
indium-doped zinc oxide (IZO), tin-doped zinc oxide,<br>
silicon-doped zinc oxide, zinc antimonate, lanthanumhexaboride,<br>
cerium hexaboride, fine gold powder, fine silver powder, fine<br>
platinum powder, and fine aluminum powder. Examples of the light<br>
shielding agents include carbon black and red iron oxide.<br>
Examples of the pigments include dark red-brown pigments obtained<br>
by mixing four pigments, namely carbon black of a black pigment,<br>
a red pigment (C.I.Pigment red), a blue pigment (C.I.Pigment<br>
blue) and a yellow pigment (C.I.Pigment yellow).<br>
The average particle size of the fine-particle inorganic<br>
powder to be used in the third invention is preferably in the<br>
range of 1 to 100 \xm, more preferably in the range of 1 to 50<br>
Âµm. Such average particle size can be measured by the dynamic<br>
light scatteringmethodusing a light scattering instrument (e.g. ,<br>
"DLS-6000AL" manufactured by Otsuka Electronics) and an Ar laser<br>
as a light source. The amount of the fine-particle inorganic<br>
powder is generally used at ratios in the range of 0.3 to 30<br>
parts by weight, preferably in the range of 0.5 to 20 parts by<br><br>
weight, per 100 parts by weight of the polyvinyl acetal resin,<br>
so that the transparent polyvinyl acetal resin film may be<br>
produced. The heat-ray shielding fine particles are usually<br>
used at ratios in the range of 0.001 to 30 parts by weight,<br>
preferably in the range of 0.001 to 10 parts by weight, more<br>
preferably in the range of 0.005 to 5 parts by weight, per 100<br>
parts by weight of the polyvinyl acetal resin.<br>
Particularly, the above-described opaque and<br>
sound-insulating polyvinyl acetal resin layer is easy to be<br>
produced in the subdued color tone, since most of the<br>
fine-particle inorganic powder is achromatic (white, light gray,<br>
gray, blackish gray, black).<br>
Taking into consideration the minimum levels or magnitudes<br>
of penetration resistance and weatherability required of the<br>
laminated glass, in general, the interlayer for laminated glass<br>
according to the third invention preferably shows a total film<br>
thickness in the range of 0.3 to 1.6 mm for practical reasons,<br>
as is the same with the conventional transparent interlayers<br>
for laminated glass.<br>
The above-described sound-insulating polyvinyl acetal<br>
resin layer can be produced by kneading the above-described<br>
polyvinyl acetal resin, the above-mentioned plasticizer, and<br>
a variety of additives to be added, as the case may be, with<br>
an extruder, a plastograph, a kneader, a banbury mixer or a<br>
calender roll, followed by film-forming into the sheet form by<br>
the conventional film forming process such as the extrusion,<br>
calendering and press processes.<br>
The opaque and sound-insulating polyvinyl acetal resin layer<br>
can be produced by kneading the above-described polyvinyl acetal<br><br>
resin, the above-mentioned fine -particle inorganic powder, the<br>
above-mentioned plasticizer, and the above-described opacif ier,<br>
as well as heat-ray shielding fine particles, inorganic fine<br>
particles such as various pigments and a variety of additives<br>
to be added, as the case may be, with an extruder, a plastograph,<br>
a kneader, a banbury mixer, or a calender roll, followed by film<br>
forming into the sheet form by the conventional film forming<br>
process such as the extrusion, calendaring and press processes .<br>
The interlayer for laminated glass according to the third<br>
invention can be produced by stacking the opaque and<br>
sound-insulating polyvinyl acetal resin layer and the<br>
transparent polyvinyl acetal resin layer as individually formed<br>
separately in the above-described, and applying heat and pressure<br>
to integrate the layer assembly into one structural member. Also,<br>
the interlayer may be produced by film-forming through the<br>
multiple-layer extrusion process into one structural member a<br>
film-forming resin composition for forming the above-described<br>
opaque and sound insulting polyvinyl acetal resin layer, a<br>
film-forming resin composition for forming a transparent<br>
polyvinyl acetal resin layer, and optionally a resin composition<br>
for forming a transparent polyvinyl acetal resin layer. As an<br>
alternative production process, the interlayer may be produced<br>
concurrently with the production of the laminated glass by<br>
stacking the opaque and sound-insulating polyvinyl acetal resin<br>
layer, the transparent polyvinyl acetal resin layer, and a<br>
transparent polyvinyl acetal resin layer, if necessary, between<br>
two glass sheets, followed by heating and compressing to be<br>
integrated into one structural member.<br>
The laminated glass of the third invention can be produced<br><br>
using the same method as used for producing conventional<br>
laminated glass. For example, the laminated glass is produced<br>
by sandwitching the above-described interlayer for laminated<br>
glass between at least two transparent glass sheets, then passing<br>
them through pressure rolls or placing them in a rubber bag,<br>
followed by vacuum suction to give a laminated body through the<br>
preliminary bonding of the interlayer with the glass sheets at<br>
about 70 to 110Â°C, while removing air remaining between the glass<br>
sheets and the interlayer, and placing the deaerated laminated<br>
body in an autoclave or subjecting the same to pressing to carry-<br>
out the final bonding at about 120 to 150Â°C under an applied<br>
pressure of about 1 to 1.5 MPa.<br>
It is to be noted that the transparent glass sheets are<br>
not particularly limited, and transparent glass sheets generally<br>
used can be used. Examples of such transparent glass sheets<br>
include various kinds of inorganic glass sheets, such as float<br>
plate glass sheets, heat-absorbing glass sheets, polished plate<br>
glass sheets, template glass sheets, wire plate glass sheets<br>
and line plate glass sheets, and various organic glass plates<br>
or sheets, such as polycarbonate plates or sheets and polymethyl<br>
methacrylate plates or sheets. These glass sheets may be used<br>
singly or in combination of two or more thereof. Among them,<br>
heat-absorbing glass sheets are preferably used. It is to be<br>
noted that the thickness of such glass sheets is not particularly<br>
limited and can be appropriately selected depending upon their<br>
intended use, although it is desirably in the range of 1 to 3<br>
mm.<br>
(The Fourth Invention)<br>
The interlayer for laminated glass of the fourth invention<br><br>
is characterized in that said interlayer comprises a<br>
sound-insulating polyvinyl acetal resin layer being laminated<br>
with an opaque polyvinyl acetal resin layer.<br>
In the fourth invention, the sound-insulating polyvinyl<br>
acetal resin layer is not particularly limited, and there is<br>
preferably used, for example, the known sound-insulating<br>
polyvinyl acetal resin layers conventionally used as an<br>
interlayer for sound-insulating laminated glass . Particularly,<br>
use is preferably made of a sound-insulating polyvinyl acetal<br>
resin layer as described in the above-mentioned Official Gazette<br>
of Japanese Patent No. 2703471.<br>
Namely, it is particularly preferable to use, as a<br>
sound-insulating polyvinyl acetal resin layer (A) , at least one<br>
resin layer composed of a polyvinyl acetal resin (a) with a vinyl<br>
acetate content (residual acetyl groups) of 8 to 30 mol%, as<br>
produced by acetalization of a polyvinyl alcohol with an<br>
aldehyde having 4 to 6 carbon atoms, and a plasticizer.<br>
The above-described sound-insulating polyvinyl acetal<br>
resin layer may be composed of a sound-insulating polyvinyl<br>
acetal resin composition, and said sound-insulating polyvinyl<br>
acetal resin composition may be a polyvinyl acetal resin<br>
composition which contains 45 parts by weight or more of a<br>
plasticizer per 100 parts by weight of a polyvinyl acetal resin.<br>
Also, in the fourth invention, the resin which constitutes<br>
the opaque polyvinyl acetal resin layer is not particularly<br>
limited, and there can be used the known polyvinyl acetal resins<br>
being conventionally used as an interlayer for laminated glass .<br>
Such resins can be admixed for dispersion with an appropriate<br>
amount each of a plasticizer and inorganic fine particles<br><br>
(coloring agent) to thereby form opaque polyvinyl acetal resin<br>
layers. It is preferable to use opaque polyvinyl acetal resin<br>
layers (B) composed of the above-described polyvinyl acetal<br>
resins (b) with a vinyl acetate content (residual acetyl groups)<br>
of not more than 14 mol%, as produced by acetalization of a<br>
polyvinyl alcohol with an aldehyde having 3 to 4 carbon atoms,<br>
a plasticizer, and inorganic fine particles (coloring agent)<br>
such as opacifiers, heat-ray shielding fine particles, light<br>
shielding agents, a variety of dyes and pigments.<br>
When the sound-insulating polyvinyl acetal resin layer is<br>
colored, there may be contained inorganic fine particles<br>
(coloring agent) , such as opacifiers, heat-ray shielding fine<br>
particles, light shielding agents, dyes and pigments.<br>
In the fourth invention, a laminate of a sound-insulating<br>
polyvinyl acetal resin layer (A) and an opaque polyvinyl acetal<br>
resin layer (B) is used as the interlayer for laminated glass<br>
and may further be laminated with a transparent polyvinyl acetal<br>
resin layer. The composition of such transparent polyvinyl<br>
acetal resin layer is not particularly limited and there is used<br>
a resin layer, as obtained by mixing and dispersing an appropriate<br>
amount of a plasticizer in a known polyvinyl acetal resin<br>
conventionally used as an interlayer for laminated glass.<br>
Particularly, it is preferred to use the transparent polyvinyl<br>
acetal resin layer (C) composed of the above-described polyvinyl<br>
acetal resin (b) and a plasticizer.<br>
In the fourth invention, the interlayer for laminated glass<br>
of the fourth invention can be produced by lamination of the<br>
resin layer (A) and the resin layer (B) as essential components,<br>
as well as a resin layer (C), if necessary, and the order of<br><br>
stacking these resin layers is not particularly limited, only<br>
if the resultant laminate has at least one layer out of the resin<br>
layer (A) and resin layer (B) . There can be employed any arbitrary<br>
layer-assembly constructions, such as (B)/(A)/(B), (B)/(A)/(C),<br>
(A)/(C)/(B), (C)/(A)/(C)/(B) , andthelike. From the viewpoint<br>
of secured ease of handling for the interlayer for laminated<br>
glass, particularly preferred is the interlayer having the<br>
layer-assembly construction in which the resin layer (B) or the<br>
resin layer (C) makes up the outermost surface layer.<br>
The haze value of the laminated glass, as produced in the<br>
above-described manner by bonding transparent glass sheets to<br>
both sides of the thus obtained interlayer for laminated glass,<br>
is preferably not less than 20%, particularly preferably not<br>
less than 50%, more preferably not less than 60% . If the haze<br>
value of the laminated glass is less than 20%, scattering of<br>
visible light diminishes, so that the light shielding property<br>
of the laminated glass is impaired, thereby reducing the effect<br>
of ameliorating the deterioration in sound-insulating property<br>
caused by, for example, sunlight irradiation.<br>
Examples of the above-mentioned opacif iers include calcium<br>
carbonate, alumina, kaolin clay, calcium silicate, magnesium<br>
oxide, magnesium hydroxide, aluminum hydroxide, magnesium<br>
carbonate, talc, feldspar powder, mica, baryte, barium carbonate,<br>
titanium oxide, silica, and glass beads. Examples of the<br>
heat-ray shielding fine particles include tin-doped indium oxide<br>
(ITO), antimony-doped tin oxide (ATO) , aluminum-doped zinc oxide<br>
(AZO), indium-doped zinc oxide (IZO), tin-doped zinc oxide,<br>
silicon-doped zinc oxide, zinc antimonate, lanthanumhexaboride,<br>
cerium hexaboride, fine gold powder, fine silver powder, fine<br><br>
platinum powder, and fine aluminum powder. Examples of the light<br>
shielding agents include carbon black and red iron oxide.<br>
Example of the pigments includes a dark red-brown pigment<br>
obtained by mixing four pigments, i. e. , a black pigment of carbon<br>
black, a red pigment (C.I.Pigment red), a blue pigment<br>
(C.I. Pigment blue), and a yellow pigment (C.I. Pigment yellow) .<br>
They can be used singly or as mixtures of two or more thereof,<br>
and from the viewpoint of weatherability, inorganic fine<br>
particles are considered preferable.<br>
The average particle size of the inorganic fine particles<br>
such as opacifiers, heat-ray shielding fine particles, light<br>
shielding agents and pigments is preferably in the range of 1<br>
to 100 Âµm, more preferably in the range of 1 to 50 Âµm. Their<br>
average particle sizes can be measured by the dynamic light<br>
scattering method using a light scattering instrument (e.g.,<br>
"DLS-6000AL" manufactured by Otsuka Electronics) and an Ar laser<br>
as a light source. The inorganic fine particles such as<br>
opacifiers, light blocking agents, or pigments are generally<br>
used at ratios in the range of 0. 3 to 30 parts by weight, preferably<br>
in the range of 0. 5 to 20 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight<br>
of the polyvinyl acetal resin, so that the opaque polyvinylacetal<br>
resin film may be produced. The heat -ray shielding fine particles<br>
are usually used at ratios in the range of 0.001 to 30 parts<br>
by weight, preferably in the range of 0.001 to 10 parts by weight,<br>
more preferably in the range of 0.005 to 5 parts by weight, per<br>
100 parts by weight of the polyvinyl acetal resin.<br>
Particularly, the opaque polyvinyl acetal resin layer is<br>
preferably colored with the inorganic fine particles, so that<br>
the colored films may be formed. Preferable are the colored<br><br>
films composed of the above-described opaque polyvinyl acetal<br>
resin being colored with fine achromatic (white, light gray,<br>
gray, blackish gray, black) inorganic particles, since they can<br>
be produced in the subdued color tone.<br>
Meanwhile, the various polyvinyl acetal resin layers as<br>
described above can be incorporated with a variety of additives<br>
used for this type of interlayers, such as UV absorbers,<br>
antioxidants and adhesion regulating agents and the like.<br>
Taking into consideration the minimum levels or magnitudes<br>
of penetration resistance and weatherability required of the<br>
laminated glass, the interlayer for laminated glass according<br>
to the fourth invention preferably shows a total film thickness<br>
in the range of 0.3 to 1.6 mm for practical reasons, as is the<br>
same with the conventional transparent interlayers for laminated<br>
glass.<br>
The above-described sound-insulating polyvinyl acetal<br>
resin layer can be produced by kneading the above-described<br>
polyvinyl acetal resin and the above-mentioned plasticizer, as<br>
well as a variety of the additives to be added, as the case may<br>
be, with an extruder, a plastograph, a kneader, a banbury mixer<br>
or a calender roll, followed by film-forming into the sheet form<br>
by the conventional film forming process such as the extrusion,<br>
calendering and press processes.<br>
The above-described opaque polyvinyl acetal resin layer<br>
can be produced by kneading the above-described polyvinyl<br>
acetal resin, the above-mentioned plasticizer and the<br>
above-mentioned opacifiers, as well as inorganic fine<br>
particles such as heat-ray shielding fine particles, light<br>
shielding agents and various pigments, and if necessary, a<br><br>
variety of the additives to be added, with an extruder, a<br>
plastograph, a kneader, a banbury mixer, or a calender roll,<br>
followed by film-forming into the sheet form by the conventional<br>
film forming process, such as the extrusion, calendering and<br>
press processes.<br>
The interlayer for laminated glass of the fourth invention<br>
can be produced by stacking the sound- insulating polyvinyl acet al<br>
resin layer and the opaque polyvinyl acetal resin layer, which<br>
are individually film-formed separately as described above, as<br>
well as an opaque or transparent polyvinyl acetal resin layer,<br>
as the case may be, followed by heating and pressuring to be<br>
integrated into one structural member. The interlayer can also<br>
be produced by film-forming into one structural member through<br>
multiple-layer extrusion process a film-forming resin<br>
composition for the above-mentioned sound-insulting polyvinyl<br>
acetal resin layer and a film-forming resin composition for the<br>
opaque polyvinyl acetal resin layer, as well as a film-forming<br>
resin composition for the opaque polyvinyl acetal resin layer,<br>
as the case may be. As an alternative process, the interlayer<br>
can be produced concurrently with the production of laminated<br>
glass by stacking the sound-insulating polyvinyl acetal rein<br>
layer and the opaque polyvinyl acetal resin layer, as well as<br>
an opaque or transparent polyvinyl acetal resin layer, as the<br>
case may be, between two glass sheets, followed by heating and<br>
pressuring to be integrated into one structural member.<br>
The laminated glass of the fourth invention can be produced<br>
by the same process as the conventional one for producing<br>
laminated glass. For example, the laminated glass is produced<br>
by sandwitching the above-described interlayer for laminated<br><br>
glass between at least two transparent glass sheets, then passing<br>
them through pressure rolls or placing them in a rubber bag,<br>
followed by vacuum suction to give a laminated body through<br>
the preliminary bonding of the interlayer to the glass sheets<br>
at about 70 to 110Â°C, while removing air remaining between the<br>
glass sheets and the interlayer, and placing the deaerated<br>
laminated body in an autoclave or subjecting the same to pressing<br>
to carry out the final bonding at about 120 to 150Â°C under an<br>
applied pressure of about 1 to 1.5 MPa.<br>
Meanwhile, the transparent glass sheets are not particularly<br>
limited, and transparent glass sheets generally used can be used.<br>
Examples of such transparent glass sheets include various kinds<br>
of inorganic glass sheets, such as float plate glass sheets,<br>
heat-absorbing glass sheets, polished plate glass sheets,<br>
template glass sheets, wire plate glass sheets and line plate<br>
glass sheets, and various organic glass plates or sheets such<br>
as polycarbonate plates and polymethyl methacrylate plates.<br>
These glass sheets may be used singly or in combination of two<br>
or more thereof. Among them, heat-absorbing glass sheets are<br>
preferably used. The thickness of each glass sheet is not<br>
particularly limited and can be appropriately selected<br>
depending upon their intended use, but is preferably in the range<br>
of 1 to 3 mm.<br>
The haze value of the laminated glass as obtained in the<br>
above manner which are included in the first to fourth inventions<br>
is preferably not less than 20%, particularly preferably not<br>
less than 50%, more preferably not less than 60%. When the haze<br>
value of the laminated glass of the present invention is less<br>
than 20%, scattering of visible light dimishes, thereby impairing<br><br>
the light shielding property of the laminated glass.<br>

(Evaluation)<br>
For the laminated glasses produced individually in Examples<br><br>
2-1 and 2-2 and Comparative Example 2-1, a haze value and a loss<br>
factor were measured using the following methods. For the<br>
interlayers for laminated glass produced individually in<br>
Examples 2-1 and 2-2 and Comparative Example 2-1, self-adhesive<br>
strength was measured using the following method. The<br>
evaluation results are shown in Table 2.<br>
Further, for the laminated glasses produced individually<br>
in Examples 2-3 and 2-4, a haze value, a loss factor and a<br>
self-adhesive strength were measured, while a visible light<br>
transmittance (Tv), a solar transmittance (Te), and a solar<br>
reflectance (Re) were measured using the following methods. The<br>
evaluation results are shown in Table 3.<br>
(1)	Measurement of Haze Value<br>
A haze value in the rays of light at the wavelength of 340<br>
to 1800 nm was measured with an integrating turbidimeter<br>
(manufactured by Tokyo Denshoku Co.) in accordance with JIS K<br>
6714 "Methacryl Resin Plate for Aircrafts".<br>
(2)	Measurement of Loss Factor<br>
A sample (25 mm wide x 300 mm long) was cut from the laminated<br>
glass, and subjected to vibration by use of a vibration generator<br>
for damping test ("G21-005D" manufactured by Shinken Co.) in<br>
a thermostat-controlled bath at 20Â°C, and the resulting vibration<br>
characteristics were amplified by a mechanical impedance<br>
amplifier ("XG-81" manufactured by RION Co.), whereby the<br>
vibrational spectra were analyzed by an FFT spectrum analyzer<br>
("FFT Spectrum Analyzer HP 3582A" manufactured by Yokogawa<br>
Hewlett Packard Co.) to determine a loss factor from a peak in<br>
the frequency range from 2 , 000 to 3 , 000 Hz . A higher loss factor<br>
means a higher level of sound-insulating property.<br><br>
(3) Measurement of Self-Adhesive Strength<br>
Two samples (10 mm wide x 100 mm long) were cut from the<br>
interlayer for laminated glass under the conditions of 23Â°C and<br>
50%RH, and after they were positioned to overlap each other,<br>
a roller weighing 2 kg was rolled back and forth twice over the<br>
overlapped pieces in their lengthwise direction to make<br>
pressure-bonding. After a double sided tape was bonded to one<br>
side of the resultant test sample, it was fixed to a fixation<br>
plate made of SUS via the double sided tape and subjected to<br>
a 180Â° peeling test at a peeling rate of 500 mm/min to thereby<br>
determine a peeling strength.<br>
(4) Measurement of Visible Light Transmittance (Tv), Solar<br>
Transmittance (Te), and Solar Reflectance (Re)<br>
A visible light transmittance (Tv) at the wavelength of<br>
380 to 780 nm, a solar transmittance (Te) at the wavelength of<br>
300 to 2100 nm, and a solar reflectance (Re) at the wavelength<br>
of 300 to 2100 nm were measured with a direct-recording<br>
spectrophotometer ("UV-3100" manufactured by Shimadzu Corp.)<br>
in accordance with JIS Z 8722 and JIS R 3106.<br><br><br>
As can be seen from Table 2, the laminated glass produced<br>
with the interlayer for laminated glass of Example 2-1 or 2-2<br>
containing inorganic powder such as silica powder or calcium<br>
carbonate powder has a higher loss factor than the laminated<br>
glass produced with the interlayer for laminated glass of<br>
Comparative Example2-1 containing no inorganic powder. These<br>
results indicate that the laminated glasses of Examples 2-1 and<br>
2-2 offer highly sound-insulating property.<br>
Further, the interlayer for laminated glass containing<br>
inorganic powder such as silica powder or calcium carbonate<br>
powder has a lowered self-adhesive strength among the<br>
interlayer-f ilms so that blocking is less likely to occur during<br>
storage or handling.<br><br><br>

temperature to allow the reaction product to precipitate, then<br>

with excessive water to wash out unreacted n-butyraldehyde,<br>
treated with an aqueous sodium hydroxide solution to neutralize<br>
the hydrochloric acid catalyst, washedagain with excessive water<br><br>
for 2 hours, and dried to give a polyvinyl butyral resin (b)<br>

Glass<br>
The resin layers A-1 and B as used were stacked in the order<br>
of resin layer B/resin layer A-1/resin layer B, and the stacked<br>
resin layers were sandwiched between two transparent float glass<br>

2.6kPa, transferred in an oven at 9 0Â°C, while keeping it deaerated,<br>
and vacuum-pressed while maintaining it at 90Â°C for 30 minutes.<br>
The thus preliminarily bonded laminated glass was subjected to<br>

(Evaluation)<br>
For the laminated glasses produced individually in Examples<br>

factor were measured using the following methods. The<br>
evaluation results are shown in Table 4.<br>
For the laminated glasses produced individually in Examples<br>
3-3 to 3-6, a haze value, a loss factor, a visible light<br>
transmittance (Tv), a solar transmittance (Te), and a solar<br>
reflectance (Re) were measured using the following methods. The<br>
evaluation results are shown in Table 5.<br>
(1) Measurement of Haze Value<br>
A haze value against the rays of light at the wavelengths<br>
of 340 to 1800 nm was measured with an integrating turbidimeter<br>
(manufactured by Tokyo Denshoku) in accordance with JIS K 6714<br>
"Methacryl Resin Plate for Aircrafts".<br>
(2) Measurement of Loss Factor<br><br>
A sample (25 mm wide x 300 mm long) was cut from the laminated<br>
glass, and subjected to vibration by the use of a vibration<br>
generator for damping tests ("G21-005D" manufactured by Shinken<br>
Co., Ltd.) in a thermostat-controlled bath at 20Â°C. The<br>
resulting vibration characteristics were amplified by a<br>
mechanical impedance amplifier ("XG-81" manufactured by RION<br>
Co., Ltd.) and the vibration spectra were analyzed by an FFT<br>
spectrum analyzer ( "FFT spectrum analyzer HP 3582A" manufactured<br>
by Yokogawa Hewlett Packard Co.) to determine a loss factor from<br>
a peak in the frequency range from 2,000 to 3,000 Hz. A higher<br>
loss factor means a higher level of sound-insulating property.<br>

glass of Examples 3-1 and 3-2 which comprises a laminate of the<br>
opaque and sound-insulating polyvinyl acetal resin layer (A)<br>
containing silica powder or calcium carbonate powder as<br>
fine-particle inorganic powder with the transparent polyvinyl<br>
acetal resin layer (B) were found to provide the laminated glass<br>
with a higher loss factor than the interlayer for laminated glass<br>
of Comparative Example 3-1 which comprises a laminate of the<br>
resin layers not being incorporated with inorganic powder.<br>
Namely, such interlayers were shown to provide a laminated glass<br>
with highly sound-insulating property.<br><br><br>

(Evaluation)<br>
For the laminated glass sheets produced individually in<br>
Examples 4-1 to 4-4 and Comparative Example 4-1, a haze value<br><br>
and a loss factor were measured using the following methods.<br>
The evaluation results are shown in Table 6.<br>
For each of the laminated glass sheets produced in Examples<br>
4-5 to 4-12, a haze value, a loss factor, a visible light<br>
transmittance (Tv), a solar transmittance (Te), and a solar<br>
reflectance (Re) were measured using the following methods . The<br>
evaluation results of Examples 4-5 to 4-8 and Examples 4-9 to<br>
4-12 are shown in Tables 7 and 8, respectively.<br>
(1)	Measurement of Haze Value<br>
A haze value in the rays of light at the wavelengths of<br>
340 to 1800 nm was measured with an integrating turbidimeter<br>
(manufactured by Tokyo Denshoku Co. ) in accordance with JIS K<br>
6714 "Methacryl Resin Plate for Aircraft".<br>
(2)	Measurement of Loss Factor<br>
A sample (25 mm wide x 300 mm long) was cut from the laminated<br>
glass, and subjected to vibration by the use of a vibration<br>
generator for damping tests ("G21-005D" manufactured by Shinken<br>
Co.) in a thermostat-controlled bath at 20Â°C. The resulting<br>
vibration characteristics were amplified by a mechanical<br>
impedance amplifier ("XG-81" manufactured by RION Co. ) and the<br>
vibration spectra were analyzed by an FFT spectrum analyzer ( "FFT<br>
Spectrum Analyzer HP 3582A" manufactured by Yokogawa Hewlett<br>
Packard Co.) to determine a loss factor from the peak in the<br>
frequency range from 2,000 to 3,000 Hz. A higher loss factor<br>
means a higher level of sound-insulating property.<br>
In the above-mentioned measurements, the laminated glass<br>
was illuminated from the above with a 114 W incandescent lamp<br>
for 30 minutes, whereby the loss factors were measured before<br>
and after illumination with the incandescent lamp to determine<br><br>
whether or not the laminated glass underwent a change in<br>
sound-insulating property due to light illumination and als<br>
the degree of such change.<br>
(3) Measurement of Visible Light Transmittance (Tv), Solan<br>
Transmittance (Te), and Solar Reflectance (Re)<br>
A visible light transmittance (Tv) at the wavelengths oi<br>
380 to 780 nm, a solar transmittance (Te) at the wavelengths<br>
of 300 to 2100 nm, and a solar reflectance (Re) at the wavelengths<br>
of 300 to 2100 nm were measured with a direct-recording<br>
spectrophotometer ("UV-3100" manufactured by Shimadzu Corp.)<br>
in accordance with JIS Z 8722 and JIS R 3106.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
