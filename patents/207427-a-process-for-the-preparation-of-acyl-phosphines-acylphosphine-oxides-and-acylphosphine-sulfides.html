Process for the preparation of acvlphosphines, acvl oxides and acvl sulfides<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of acylphosphines, acyl oxides and acyl sulfides without isolation of the intermediates.<br>
Mono- and bisacylphosphines are known in the state of the art as intermediates which are obtained when preparing mono- and bisacylphosphine oxide or mono- and bisacylphosphine sulfide compounds. These oxides and sulfides find diverse applications as reactive initiators in the light-induced polymerisation of ethylenically unsaturated compounds. This is documented in a plurality of patents, inter alia in US 4298738, 4737593, 4792632, 5218009, 5399770, 5472992 or 5534559.<br>
US 4298738 discloses the preparation of monoacylphosphine oxides via reaction of diorga-nylphosphine chloride with an alcohol and subsequent reaction of the reaction product with an acid halide. In EP 40721, monoacylphosphines are obtained from the reaction of acid halides with lithium diorganylphosphine, diorganylphosphine or diorganyltrialkylsilylphos-phine, which are obtained via reaction with butyl lithium.<br>
In Angew. Makromol. Chem. 199 (1992), 1-6, S. Banerjee et al. describe the preparation of poly(terephthaloylphosphine) via reaction of dilithium phenylphosphine with terephthaloyl chloride.<br>
US 5472992, inter alia, carries out the preparation of bisacylphosphine oxide photoinitiators via reaction of the phosphine with the corresponding acid chloride in the presence of a base with subsequent oxidation of the bisacylphosphine formed.<br>
As the technology of the mono- and bisacylphosphine oxides is becoming increasingly important owing to the excellent photoinitiator properties of these compounds, there is also a need for highly practicable processes involving as little elaboration as possible for the preparation of the required intermediates, especially of the corresponding mono- and bisacylphosphines, but also of the oxide and sulfide end products.<br>
A process has now been found by which it is possible to circumvent the use of the phosphine educts (R2-PH, R-PH2) which are undesirable because of their volatility, bad smell, toxicity and susceptibility to air and fire.<br><br>
This invention relates both to a one-pot process for the preparation of mono- and bisacyl-phosphines and to a one-pot process for the preparation of mono- and bisacylphosphine oxides or mono- and bisacylphosphine sulfides, where the starting material may be the mo-nohalogenophosphines or P,P-dihaIogenophosphines, which are less volatile, less toxic and less susceptible to air.<br><br>

Rn R3, m and n have the meaning cited above, Me is an alkali metal or magnesium or mixtures thereof.<br>
Suitable metals are, for example, lithium, sodium or potassium. It is also possible to use mixtures of these metals in the process of this invention. Magnesium in combination with lithium and/or potassium and/or sodium is also suitable. If lithium, sodium or potassium are used, then it is useful to employ from 4 to 6 atom equivalents of the alkali metal for the preparation of bisacylphosphines, and 2 to 3 atom equivalents of the alkali metal for the preparation of monoacylphosphines. If the reaction is carried out using a mixture of magnesium with one or several alkali metals, then z atom equivalents of magnesium are used and 4 to 6, or 2 or 3, minus z/2 atom equivalents of the alkali metal(s) are added. nf is a value from 0.5-3.5. If the reaction is carried out using magnesium or sodium in combination with lithium, then the reaction solution is first only charged with magnesium or sodium, the lithium being added later. If magnesium is used, then the magnesium chloride obtained is usefully removed by filtration before the lithium is added. In the process of this invention the use of lithium, sodium or potassium is preferred.<br>
The reaction is usefully carried out in a solvent. The solvent used may be, in particular, ethers which are liquid at normal pressure and room temperature. Examples thereof are dimethyl ether, diethyl ether, methylpropyl ether, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, bis(2-methoxyethyl)-ether, dioxane or tetrahydrofuran. Tetrahydrofuran is preferably used. The reaction temperatures are preferably in the range from -20°C to +120°C, e.g. from 80°C to120°C.<br>
Where required, the reaction is carried out with addition of a catalyst. Suitable catalysts are aromatic hydrocarbons, with or without heteroatoms, such as naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene, biphenyl, terphenyl, quaterphenyl, triphenylene, trans-1,2-diphenylethene, py-rene, perylene, acenaphthalene, decacyclene, quinoline, N-ethylcarbazole, dibenzothio-phene or dibenzofuran.<br>
The reaction (1) is preferably carried out in the presence of a catalyst, preferably naphthalene and biphenyl.<br>

The metallised phosphine (Ha) obtained as described above is reacted in the next reaction<br><br>
R1. R2 R31 Me, m and n have the meaning cited above. Y is bromo or chloro, preferably<br>
chloro.<br>
The solvents used may be, for example, the same as those used above for the first step.<br>
However, it is also possible to remove the solvent used in the first step by distillation and to<br>
take up the residue in another solvent and then to further process it<br>
It is preferred to work in the same solvent as in the preceding step, most preferably in tetra-<br>
hydrofuran.<br>
The reaction temperatures for the reaction with the acid halide are usefully in the range from<br>
-20° to +80°C.<br>
In the novel process, the reaction (1) of the organic phosphorus halides (II) is preferably carried out with magnesium in combination with an alkali metal in the temperature range from80°to120°C.<br>
In the novel process, the reaction (1) of the organic phosphorus halides (II) with an alkali metal is carried out, for example, in the temperature range from -20° to +120°C. In the novel process, the reaction (2) of the metallised phosphine with the acid chloride (III) is preferably carried out in the temperature range from -20° to +80°C.<br>
The mono- or bisacylphosphine of formula I can be isolated by the customary technological methods which are known to the skilled person, for example by filtration, evaporation or distillation. Likewise, the customary methods of purification may be used, for example crystallisation, distillation or chromatography.<br>
However, the phosphines can also be reacted without isolation to the corresponding mono-or bisacylphosphine oxides or mono- or bisacylphosphine sulfides.<br>
Depending on the substituents used, isomeric mixtures may be formed by the novel process.<br><br>
Using the process of this invention it is also possible to prepare mono- and bisacylphos-phines together in one reaction step.<br>
By means of the novel process it is furthermore also possible to prepare mixtures of aliphatic and aromatic monoacylphosphines or mixtures of aliphatic and aromatic bisacylphosphines. Mixtures of compounds of formula II, wherein Ri is an aliphatic radical, and of compounds of formula II, wherein Ri is an aromatic radical, are used in this case.<br>
If required, all of the mixtures may be separated by the processes customarily used in the technology or they may be further used as they are.<br>
This invention also relates to a process for the preparation of mono- and bisacylphosphine oxides or mono- and bisacylphosphine sulfides. This process is first carried out as described above and a mono- or bisacylphosphine (I) is prepared. The crude reaction product (I) can then be further processed without purification and an additional reaction step may be carried out without isolation of the phosphine (I) using the solution of the crude product. If required, the solvent may be changed, for example by concentrating the solution containing the mono-or bisacylphosphine and taking up the residue in a new solvent. Of course it is also possible to further react above-described unseparated mixtures of compounds of formula (I) to the corresponding oxide or sulfide.<br>
When preparing the respective oxide (IVa), the oxidation of the phosphine (I) is carried out using the oxidant conventionally used in the technology:<br><br>
Suitable oxidants are in particular hydrogen peroxide and organic peroxy compounds, for example peracetic acid or t-butylhydroperoxide, air or pure oxygen.<br>
The oxidation is usefully carried out in solution. Suitable solvents are aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene, m-xylene, p-xylene, ethylbenzene or mesitylene, or aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as alkanes and alkane mixtures, e.g. petroleum ether, hexane or cyclo-hexane.<br><br>
During oxidation, the reaction temperature Is preferably kept in the range from 0° to 120°C, preferably from 20° and 80°C.<br>
The reaction products (IVa) can be isolated and purified by conventional processing methods known to the skilled person.<br><br>
The mono- or bisacylphosphines (I) are in this case reacted in substance or, where appropriate, in a suitable inert organic solvent with an equimolar to 2-fold molar amount of elementary sulfur. Suitable solvents are for example those described for the oxidation reaction. However, it is also possible to use e.g. aliphatic or aromatic ethers, such as dibutyl ether, dioxane, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether or diphenyl ether, in the temperature range from 20° to 250°C, preferably from 60° to 120°C. The resulting mono- or bisacylphosphine sulfide, or its solution, is usefully freed from any remaining elementary sulfur by filtration. After the solvent is removed, the mono- or bisacylphosphine sulfide can be isolated by distillation or recrystallisation in pure form.<br>
As mentioned above, it is also possible to use mixtures of compounds of formula I for the oxidation or reaction to the sulfide. The correspondingly obtained oxide or sulfide mixtures can either be separated by processes customarily used in the technology or may be used as mixtures.<br>
All of the above reactions are usefully carried out with exclusion of air in an inert gas atmosphere, e.g. under nitrogen or argon gas. The respective reaction mixture is usefully also stirred.<br>
The acid halides (III) used as starting materials are known substances, some of which are commercially available, or may be prepared in analogy to known compounds.<br><br>
The preparation of the phosphorus halides (II) is also described in a great number of publications and can be carried out in analogy to the descriptions provided there. In J. Chem. Soc. (1935), 462 and J. Chem. Soc. (1944), 276, W. Davies discloses for example the preparation of aryl phosphorus chlorides by reaction of arylene with phosphorus trichloride in the presence of aluminium trichloride. According to F. Nief, Tetrahedron 47 (1991) 33, 667 or Th. Knapp, Tetrahedron 40(1984) 4, 76, the Grignard reaction of aryl halides with magnesium and phosphorus trichloride is another possibility. According to S. Metzger, J. Org. Chem. 29 (1964), 627, aikylphosphorus chlorides are accessible in the same manner. In Helv. Chim. Act. 36 (1953), 1314, Th. Weil describes the reaction of aryl halides or alkyl halides with magnesium followed by the reaction with zinc chloride and subsequent reaction with phosphorus trichloride. The reaction of aryl halides with butyl lithium and phosphorus trichloride to the corresponding aryl phosphorus chloride is disclosed by G. Whitesides in JACS 96 (1974), 5398. According to Th. Knapp, Tetrahedron 40 (1984) 4, 765, the reaction of the aryl magnesium halide with bis(dimethylamino)phosphorus chloride followed by the reaction with hydrochloric acid also results in the desired starting material. According to A. Burg, US 2934564, the same method may also be used for the preparation of the corresponding alkyl phosphorus chlorides.<br>
It is characteristic of the novel process that the acylphosphines, acylphosphine oxides or acylphosphine sulfides can be prepared without using the phosphine starting materials (R2PH, RPH2) which are usually employed. It is also crucial that the individual processing steps can be carried out directly one after the other without isolating the respective intermediates and purifying them especially.<br>
Mixtures such as those described in the process for the preparation of the corresponding phosphines may also be formed, or may also be specifically produced, in the above-described process for the preparation of mono- or bisacylphosphine oxides or mono- or bisacyl-phosphine sulfides. Such mixtures can be separated by methods known in the technology or may be further used in the form of mixtures.<br>
In the above-described processes, R1t if n = 1, is CrC^alkyl, cyclohexyl, phenyl or biphenyl, the radicals phenyl and biphenyl being unsubstituted or substituted by one to four CrCsalkyl and/or C1-C8alkoxy;<br><br><br>
R3 is CrCi2aIkyl, cyclohexyl, phenyl or biphenyl, the radicals phenyl and biphenyl being un-substituted or substituted by one to four CrC9alkyl and/or d-C8alkoxy; Q is a single bond or -O-, and R4 and R5 are hydrogen.<br>
Compounds to be highlighted in the above processes are those of formula I, wherein R2 is phenyl which is substituted in 2,6- or 2,4,6-position by C1-C4alkyl and/or C1-C4aIkoxy.<br>
Compounds of formula I which are particularly preferably used in the above process are those wherein n is 1.<br>
Y in formula II of the novel process is preferably chloro.<br>
Other preferred compounds of formula I in the above process are those, wherein m is defined as the number two, i.e. bisacylphosphine or bisacylphosphine oxides or bisacyl-phosphine sulfides.<br>
A preferred process is that, wherein in formula, I, n is 1, m is 1 or 2f Ri is phenyl which is un-substituted or substituted by C1-C4alkyl or CrCsalkoxy, or Ri is Ci-Ci2alkyl; R2 is phenyl which is substituted by halogen, C1-C4alkoxy or Ci-C4alkyl; and R3 is unsubstituted or C1-C4-alkyl-substituted phenyl.<br>
This invention also relates to the compounds and mixtures of compounds obtained by the novel process.<br>
The phosphines which are accessible by the novel process are important educts for the preparation of the corresponding phosphine oxides and phosphine sulfides. The phosphine oxides and phosphine sulfides are used in the art as initiators in photopolymerisation reactions.<br><br>
The following Examples illustrate the invention in more detail. As in the remaining description and in the patent claims, parts or percentages are by weight, unless otherwise stated.<br>
Example 1   Preparation of bis(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)phenylphosphine oxide Excluding moisture by an argon atmosphere, 7 g of lithium (1.0 mol; 25% excess) are suspended at room temperature in 400 ml of tetrahydrofuran (THF) and this suspension is charged with 1.0 g (0.008 mol) of naphthalene. This mixture is then stirred for 10 minutes at room temperature, resulting in a dark brown to black suspension. With vigorous stirring, a solution of 36.50 g of P,P-dichlorophenyIphosphine (98%; 0.20 mol) in 80 ml of THF is added dropwise over 1 hour at 20-25°C (occasional cooling in an ice bath). With exclusion of moisture and using argon protective gas, the black solution is filtered via a glass frit (G2 porosity) into a sulfonation flask. With stirring and cooling in an ice bath, a solution of 80.4 g of 2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl chloride (0.44 mol; 10% excess) in 250 ml of THF is added dropwise at room temperature over 1.5 hours and the mixture is then stirred for another 15 minutes at room  temperature. The organic phase is completely concentrated by evaporation in a rotary evaporator (the resulting phosphine has a 53.78 ppm shift in the 31P-NMR spectrum) and the residue is taken up in 200 ml of toluene and heated to 40°C. With vigorous stirring and some cooling with an ice bath, 23 g of 30 % hydrogen peroxide (0.20 mol) are added dropwise over 30 minutes and the mixture is then cooled, with stirring, to room temperature. The solution is charged with 40 ml of water and the phases are separated. The organic phase is washed twice with 30 ml each of a 10% sodium hydrogencarbonate solution and then twice with 30 ml each of water. After drying over magnesium sulfate, filtration and complete evaporation of the solvent, 85 g of a yellow oil are obtained which becomes solid after drying for one hour at about 0.1 mbar. This crude product is purified by being slurried in 150 ml of warm petroleum ether/ethyl acetate (9:1), filtering and washing with 30 ml of petroleum ether (40/60), which yields 71.5 g (85.40% yield) of the title product in the form of a yellow solid having a melting point (m.p.) of 131-132°C and a 7.43 ppm shift in the 31P-NMR spectrum. Another 14 g of the yellow oil are obtained from the mother liquor by concentrating the solvent completely, which oil is then purified by flash chromatography, yielding another 4.3 g of the title product. The total yield is thus 76.0 g (90.8 % yield).<br><br>
Example 2  Preparation of bis(2,6-dimethoxybenzoyl)phenylphosphine oxide<br>
The procedure of Example 1 is repeated, but replacing the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl chloride<br>
with 82.25 g of 2,6-dimethoxybenzoyl chloride. The phosphine obtained has a 52.17 ppm<br>
shift in the 31P-NMR spectrum and a melting point of 120-125°C. 20.1 g (64% yield) of the<br>
title product are obtained in the form of a yellow powder having a melting point of 155°C and<br>
a31P-NMRshiftof6.24ppm.<br>
Example 3  Preparation of bis(2,6-dichlorobenzoyl)phenylphosphine oxide<br>
The procedure of Example 1 is repeated, but replacing the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl chloride<br>
with 85.8 g of 2,6-dichlorobenzoyl chloride. The phosphine obtained has a melting point of<br>
117-119°C. 35,0 g (74% yield) of the title product are obtained in the form of a yellowish<br>

Example 4  Preparation of bis(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)phenylphosphine sulfide Under an argon atmosphere and with exclusion of moisture, 7 g of lithium (1.0 mol; 25% excess) are suspended at room temperature in 400 ml of tetrahydrofuran (THF) and this suspension is charged with 1.0 g (0.008 mol) of naphthalene. This mixture is then stirred for 10 minutes at room temperature, resulting in a dark brown to black suspension. With vigorous stirring, a solution of 36.50 g of P,P-dichlorophenylphosphine (98%; 0.20 mol) in 80 ml of THF is added dropwise over 1 hour at 20-25°C (occasional cooling with an ice bath). With exclusion of moisture and using argon protective gas, the black solution is filtered via a glass frit (G2 porosity) into a sulfonation flask. With stirring and cooling with an ice bath, a solution of 80.4 g of 2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl chloride (0.44 mol; 10% excess) in 250 ml of THF is added dropwise over 1.5 hours at room temperature and the mixture is then stirred for another 15 minutes at room temperature. The organic phase is completely concentrated by evaporation in a rotary evaporator and the residue is taken up in 200 ml of toluene and heated to 40°C. The solution is charged with 3.7 g of sulfur and this mixture is stirred for 6 hours at 60°C. Removal of the solvent yields 39.0 g (89.9 % yield) of a yellow oil which is recrystallised from acetonitrile, yielding the title product in the form of a yellow solid having a melting point of 123°C.<br><br>
Example 5   Preparation of bis(2,6-dimethoxybenzoyl)phenylphosphine sulfide The procedure of Example 4 is repeated, but replacing the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl chloride with 82.25 g of 2,6-dimethoxybenzoyl chloride. The amount of sulfur added is 4.91 g. Removal of the solvent and recrystallisation from 100 ml of ethyl acetate yields 21.0 g (66.0 % yield) of the title product in the form of a yellow solid having a melting point of 155°C.<br>
Example 6   Preparation of bis(2t4l6-trimethylbenzoyl)-(2,4-dipentoxyphenyl)phosphine oxide Under an argon atmosphere and with exclusion of moisture, 6.2 g of lithium (0.89 mol; 12% excess) are suspended at room temperature in 400 ml of tetrahydrofuran (THF) and this suspension is charged with 1.0 g (0.008 mol) of naphthalene. This mixture is then stirred for 10 minutes at room temperature, resulting in a dark brown to black suspension. With vigorous stirring, a solution of 74.0 g of 2,4-dipentoxyphenyl-P,P-dichlorophenyiphosphine (95%; 0.20 mol) in 50 ml of THF is then added dropwise over 1.5 hours at 20-25°C (occasional cooling with an ice bath). The resulting mixture is stirred for 6 hours at 50°C. With exclusion of moisture and using argon protective gas, the black solution is filtered via a glass frit (G2 porosity) into a sulfonation flask. With stirring and cooling with an ice bath, a solution of 76.7 g of 2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl chloride (0.42 mol; 5% excess) in 200 ml of THF is then added dropwise over 1.5 hours at room temperature and the mixture is then stirred for another 15 minutes at room temperature. The organic phase is completely concentrated by evaporation in a rotary evaporator (the resulting phosphine has a 31P-NMR shift of 42.7 ppm) and the residue is taken up in 300 ml of toluene and heated to 40°C. With vigorous stirring and some cooling with an ice bath, 23 g of 30 % hydrogen peroxide (0.20 mol) are added dropwise over 30 minutes and the mixture is then stirred for another 2.5 hours at 50°C until the reaction is complete. The reaction mixture is then allowed to cool, with stirring, to room temperature. The yellow reaction mixture is filtered over diatomaceous earth. The solution is then charged with 40 ml water and the phases are separated. The organic phase is washed twice with 50 ml each of a 10% sodium hydrogencarbonate solution and then twice with 50 ml each of water. Drying over magnesium sulfate, filtration and complete evaporation of the solvent in a rotary evaporator yields 120 g of a yellow oil. This crude product is dissolved, with heating, in 200 ml of hexane and is then allowed to cool first to 20°C and is then cooled to 0°C, the title product crystallising out in the form of a yellow solid. The product is filtered cold and washed twice with 20 ml each of cold hexane, and the resulting solid is dried in a vacuum drying oven for 12 hours at 40°C and 155 mm Hg, yielding 70.0 g (59.3 % yield) of the solid having a melting point of 91°C and a 31P-NMR shift of 14.48 ppm.

This mixture is then stirred for 10 minutes at room temperature, resulting in a dark brown to black suspension. With vigorous stirring, a solution of 10.0 g of P.P-dichloroethylphosphine (0.076 mol) in 20 ml THF is added dropwise over 1 hour at 20-25°C (occasional cooling with an ice bath). The resulting mixture is stirred for 18 hours at room temperature. With exclusion of moisture and using argon protective gas, the black solution is filtered via a glass frit (G2 porosity) into a sulfonation flask. With stirring and cooling with an ice bath, a solution of 27.87 g of 2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl chloride (0.15 mol) in 100 ml THF is added over 1,5 hours at room temperature and the mixture is then stirred for another 15 minutes at room temperature. The organic phase is completely concentrated at reduced pressure and the residue is taken up in 100 ml of toluene, 8.7 g of 30 % hydrogen peroxide then being added dropwise at 50-60°C over 30 minutes. To complete the reaction, the mixture is stirred for another hour at 60°C. The reaction mixture is then allowed to cool to room temperature and the phases are separated. The organic phase is washed twice with 50 ml each of a 10% sodium hydrogencarbonate solution and then twice with 50 ml each of water. Drying over magnesium sulfate, filtration and complete evaporation of the solvent in a rotary evaporator yields 28.0 g (97.6%) of a yellow oil which is recrystallised from ethyl acetate, yielding the title product having a melting point of 142°C.<br>
