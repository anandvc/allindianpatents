Very particular preference is given to the benzotriazoles of the following structures:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
acceptable anion or cation. Suitable pharmaceutical^ acceptable acid<br>
addition salts of the compounds of the invention are salts of inorganic<br>
acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic, phosphoric,<br>
metaphosphoric, nitric and sulfuric acid, and of organic acids such as, for<br>
example, acetic acid, benzenesulfonic, benzoic, citric, ethanesulfonic,<br>
fumaric, gluconic, glycolic, isethionic, lactic, lactobionic, maleic, malic,<br>
methanesulfonic, succinic, p-toluenesulfonic and tartaric acid. Suitable<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable basic salts are ammonium salts, alkali metal<br>
salts (such as sodium and potassium salts), alkaline earth metal salts<br>
(such as magnesium and calcium salts), trometamol (2-amino-2-<br>
hydroxymethyl-1,3-propanediol),	diethanolamine,	lysine	or<br>
ethylenediamine.<br>
Salts with a pharmaceutically unacceptable anion such as, for example, trifluoroacetate likewise belong within the framework of the invention as useful intermediates for the preparation or purification of pharmaceutically acceptable salts and/or for use in nontherapeutic, for example in vitro, applications.<br>
The term "physiologically functional derivative" used herein refers to any physiologically tolerated derivative of a compound of the formula I of the invention, for example an ester, which on administration to a mammal such as, for example, a human is able to form (directly or indirectly) a compound of the formula I or an active metabolite thereof.<br>
Physiologically functional derivatives also include prodrugs of the compounds of the invention, as described, for example, in H. Okada et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1994, 42, 57-61. Such prodrugs can be metabolized in vivo to a compound of the invention. These prodrugs may themselves be active or not.<br><br>
The compounds of the invention may also exist in various polymorphous forms, for example as amorphous and crystalline polymorphous forms. All polymorphous forms of the compounds of the invention belong within the framework of the invention and are a further aspect of the invention.<br>
All references to "compound(s) of formula I" hereinafter refer to compound(s) of the formula I as described above, and their salts, solvates and physiologically functional derivatives as described herein.<br>
The compound(s) of formula (I) may also be administered in combination with other active ingredients.<br>
The amount of a compound of formula I necessary to achieve the desired biological effect depends on a number of factors, for example the specific compound chosen, the intended use, the mode of administration and the clinical condition of the patient. The daily dose is generally in the range from 0.3 mg to 100 mg (typically from 3 mg and 50 mg) per day and per kilogram of bodyweight, for example 3-10 mg/kg/day. An intravenous dose may be, for example, in the range from 0.3 mg to 1.0 mg/kg, which can suitably be administered as infusion of 10 ng to 100 ng per kilogram and per minute. Suitable infusion solutions for these purposes may contain, for example, from 0.1 ng to 10 mg, typically from 1 ng to 10 mg, per milliliter. Single doses may contain, for example, from 1 mg to 10 g of the active ingredient. Thus, ampoules for injections may contain, for example, from 1 mg to 100 mg, and single-dose formulations which can be administered orally, such as, for example, capsules or tablets, may contain, for example, from 1.0 to 1000 mg, typically from 10 to 600 mg. For the therapy of the abovementioned conditions, the compounds of formula I may be used as the compound itself, but they are preferably in the form of a pharmaceutical composition with an acceptable carrier. The carrier must, of course, be acceptable in the sense that it is compatible with the other ingredients of the composition and is not harmful for the patient's health.<br><br>
The carrier may be a solid or a liquid or both and is preferably formulated with the compound as a single dose, for example as a tablet, which may contain from 0.05% to 95% by weight of the active ingredient. Other pharmaceutical^ active substances may likewise be present, including other compounds of formula I. The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be produced by one of the known pharmaceutical methods, which essentially consist of mixing the ingredients with pharmacologically acceptable carriers and/or excipients.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are those suitable for oral, rectal, topical, peroral (for example sublingual) and parenteral (for example subcutaneous, intramuscular, intradermal or intravenous) administration, although the most suitable mode of administration depends in each individual case on the nature and severity of the condition to be treated and on the nature of the compound of formula I used in each case. Coated formulations and coated slow-release formulations also belong within the framework of the invention. Preference is given to acid- and gastric juice-resistant formulations. Suitable coatings resistant to gastric juice comprise cellulose acetate phthalate, polyvinyl acetate phthalate, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate and anionic polymers of methacrylic acid and methyl methacrylate.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutical compounds for oral administration may be in the form of separate units such as, for example, capsules, wafers, suckable tablets or tablets, each of which contain a defined amount of the compound of formula I; as powders or granules, as solution or suspension in an aqueous or nonaqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsion. These compositions may, as already mentioned, be prepared by any suitable pharmaceutical method which includes a step in which the active ingredient and the carrier (which may consist of one or more additional ingredients) are brought into contact. The compositions are generally produced by uniform and homogeneous mixing of the active<br><br>
ingredient with a liquid and/or finely divided solid carrier, after which the product is shaped if necessary. Thus, for example, a tablet can be produced by compressing or molding a powder or granules of the compound, where appropriate with one or more additional ingredients. Compressed tablets can be produced by tableting the compound in free-flowing form such as, for example, a powder or granules, where appropriate mixed with a binder, glidant, inert diluent and/or one (more) surface-active/dispersing agent in a suitable machine. Molded tablets can be produced by molding the compound, which is in powder form and is moistened with an inert liquid diluent, in a suitable machine.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions which are suitable for peroral (sublingual) administration comprise suckable tablets which contain a compound of formula I with a flavoring, normally sucrose and gum arabic or tragacanth, and pastilles which comprise the compound in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerol or sucrose and gum arabic.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for parenteral administration comprise preferably sterile aqueous preparations of a compound of formula I, which are preferably isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient. These preparations are preferably administered intravenously, although administration may also take place by subcutaneous, intramuscular or intradermal injection. These preparations can preferably be produced by mixing the compound with water and making the resulting solution sterile and isotonic with blood. Injectable compositions of the invention generally contain from 0.1 to 5% by weight of the active compound.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for rectal administration are preferably in the form of single-dose suppositories. These can be produced by mixing a compound of the formula I with one or more<br><br>
conventional solid carriers, for example cocoa butter, and shaping the resulting mixture.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for topical use on the skin are preferably in the form of ointment, cream, lotion, paste, spray, aerosol or oil. Carriers which can be used are petrolatum, lanolin, polyethylene glycols, alcohols and combinations of two or more of these substances. The active ingredient is generally present in a concentration of from 0.1 to 15% by weight of the composition, for example from 0.5 to 2%.<br>
Transdermal administration is also possible. Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for transdermal uses can be in the form of single plasters which are suitable for long-term close contact with the patient's epidermis. Such plasters suitably contain the active ingredient in an aqueous solution which is buffered where appropriate, dissolved and/or dispersed in an adhesive or dispersed in a polymer. A suitable active ingredient concentration is about 1% to 35%, preferably about 3% to 15%. A particular possibility is for the active ingredient to be released by electrotransport or iontophoresis as described, for example, in Pharmaceutical Research, 2(6): 318 (1986).<br>
Further active ingredients suitable for combination products are: all antidiabetics mentioned in the Rote Liste 2001, chapter 12. They may be combined with the compounds of the formula I of the invention in particular for a synergistic improvement of the effect. Administration of the active ingredient combination may take place either by separate administration of the active ingredients to the patient or in the form of combination products in which a plurality of active ingredients are present in one pharmaceutical preparation. Most of the active ingredients listed below are disclosed in the USP Dictionary of USAN and International Drug Names, US Pharmacopeia, Rockville 2001.<br><br>
Antidiabetics include insulin and insulin derivatives such as, for example, Lantus® (see www.lantus.com) or HMR1964, fast-acting insulins (see US 6,221,633), GLP-1 derivatives such as, for example, those disclosed in WO 98/08871 of Novo Nordisk A/S, and orally effective hypoglycemic active ingredients.<br>
The orally effective hypoglycemic active ingredients include, preferably, sulfonylureas, biguanidines, meglitinides, oxadiazolidinediones, thiazolidinediones, glucosidase inhibitors, glucagon antagonists, GLP-1 agonists, potassium channel openers such as, for example, those disclosed in WO 97/26265 and WO 99/03861 of Novo Nordisk A/S, insulin sensitizers, inhibitors of liver enzymes involved in the stimulation of gluconeogenesis and/or glycogenosis, modulators of glucose uptake, compounds which alter lipid metabolism, such as antihyperlipidemic active ingredients and antilipidemic active ingredients, compounds which reduce food intake, PPAR and PXR agonists and active ingredients which act on the ATP-dependent potassium channel of the beta cells.<br>

In one embodiment, the compounds of the formula I are administered in combination with bulking agents, preferably insoluble bulking agents (see, for example, carob/Caromax® (Zunft H J; et al., Carob pulp preparation for treatment of hypercholesterolemia, ADVANCES IN THERAPY (2001 Sep-Oct), 18(5), 230-6.) Caromax is a carob-containing product from Nutrinova, Nutrition Specialties &amp; Food Ingredients GmbH, Industriepark Hochst, 65926 Frankfurt/Main)). Combination with Caromax® is possible in one preparation or by separate administration of compounds of the formula I and Caromax®. Caromax® can in this connection also be administered in the form of food products such as, for example, in bakery products or muesli bars.<br><br>
It will be appreciated that every suitable combination of the compounds of the invention with one or more of the aforementioned compounds and optionally one or more other pharmacologically active substances is regarded as falling within the protection conferred by the present invention.<br><br><br>
The benzotriazoles of the invention of the formula I are prepared by	<br>
methods which are known per se, e.g. by acylation of substituted or unsubstituted benzotriazole 2 with carbamoyl chlorides 3 (method A), or in<br><br>
two stages by reacting benzotriazoles with phosgene and further reaction of the resulting benzotriazolecarbonyl chloride with amines or anilines (method B).<br><br>
Since acids are usually liberated in these reactions, it is advisable to add bases such as pyridine, triethylamine, sodium hydroxide solution or alkali metal carbonates to increase the rate. The reactions can be carried out in wide temperature ranges. It has usually proved to be advantageous to operate at from 0°C to the boiling point of the solvent used. Examples of solvents employed are methylene chloride, THF, DMF, toluene, ethyl acetate, nheptane, dioxane, diethyl ether.<br>
The compounds of the invention of the formula I have a surprising inhibitory effect on hormone-sensitive lipase, HSL, an allosteric enzyme in adipocytes,  which  is  inhibited  by insulin  and  is  responsible for the<br><br>
breakdown of fats in fat cells and thus for the transfer of constituents of fats into the bloodstream. Inhibition of this enzyme thus corresponds to an<br>
insulin-like effect of the compounds of the invention, which eventually leads to a reduction of free fatty acids in the blood and of blood glucose. They can thus be employed in metabolic derangements such as, for example, in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, in diabetic syndrome, in syndrome X and in direct pancreatic damage.<br>
An inhibition of HSL in beta cells should lead to a direct recovery of insulin release (M. Winzell et al., Diabetes, Vol 52, August 2003, 2057-2065). The compounds of formula I according to the present invention can therefore also be used for insulin release.<br>
The effect of the compounds of the invention of the formula I was tested in the following enzyme assay system:<br>
Substrate preparation:<br>
Preparation of NAG (NBD monoacyl glyceride) substrate: 6 mg of phosphatidylcholine and 6 mg of phosphatidylinositol are each dissolved in 1 ml of chloroform. 10 mg of NAG are dissolved in 1 ml of chloroform. Two parts of phosphatidylinositol solution (e.g. 83.5 |al) and one part of phosphatidylcholine solution (e.g. 41.5 jil) and 100 \i\ of NAG solution are pipetted together into plastic scintillation vessels (final concentration in the assay: 0.0375 mg of phospholipid/ml; 0.05 mg/NAG/ml). The chloroform (225 \JA total volume) is completely removed by passing a stream of N2 over. The dried substrate can be stored at 4°C for up to 3 days. To prepare the phospholipid vesicles/micelles with intercalated NAG (on the day of the assay), the dried substrate is taken up in 20 ml of assay buffer (25 mM Tris/HCI, pH 7.4; 150 mM NaCI) and [lacuna] two ultrasound treatments with an ultrasonic probe (Branson Sonifier Type II, standard microtip): 1st treatment setting 2, 2 x 1 min, inbetween 1 min on ice each time; 2nd<br><br>
treatment setting 4, 2 x 1 min, inbetween 1 min on ice each time. During this procedure, the color of the substrate solution changes from yellow (extinction maximum 481 nm) to red (extinction maximum 550 nm) owing to intercalation of NAG between the phospholipid molecules in the vesicles/micelles. Before use as substrate (within the next 2 h), the solution is incubated on ice for a further 15 min.<br>
Indirect NAG assay:<br>
The assay is carried out in 1.5 ml Eppendorf vessels or 96-well plates at 30°C for 60 min. To find HSL inhibitors, 10 jal of the test substance are introduced into assay buffer (25 mM Tris/HCi, pH 7.4; 150 mM NaCI) in the presence of 16.6% DMSO. 180 jal of the substrate solution (20 jag/ml phosphatidylcholine, 10 |xg/ml phosphatidylinositol, 50 |ig/ml NAG in assay buffer) are added. After preincubation at 30°C for 15 min, 20 ^il of the enzyme solution in assay buffer (diluted 1- to 4-fold are pipetted in, and the extinction at 480 nm is immediately measured in a cuvette photometer (0.5 ml cuvette) or microtiter plate reader. After incubation at 30°C for 60 min, the extinction is measured again. The increase in extinction at 480 nm is a measure of the enzymic activity. Under standard conditions, 20 \ig of partially purified HSL lead to a change of 0.4 = 4000 arb. units in extinction.<br>
Direct NAG assay:<br>
As alternative to measurement of the change in extinction of the substrate solution, the products of the HSL reaction are investigated by phase separation/thin-layer chromatography. For this purpose, 1.3 ml of methanol/chloroform/heptane (10:9:7) and then 0.4 ml of 0.1 M NaOH are added to the incubation mixture (200 jul total volume, see indirect NAG assay) in 2 ml Eppendorf vessels. After vigorous mixing (10 sec), phase separation    is    initiated    by   centrifugation    (800xg,    20 min,    room<br><br>
temperature). Equivalent volumes (e.g. 0.4 ml) are taken from the aqueous upper phase, and the extinction at 481 nm is determined in a photometer. For thin-layer chromatography, the aqueous phase is dried (SpeedVac) and then taken up in 50 ^l of tetrahydrofuran. 5 \i\ samples are loaded onto silica gel Si-60 plates (Merck). The chromatography is carried out with 78 ml of diethyl ether/22 ml of petroleum ether/1 ml of glacial acetic acid as mobile phase. The amount of liberated fluorescent NBD-fatty acid is determined by Phosphorimaging (Molecular Dynamics, Storm 840 and ImageQuant Software) at an excitation wavelength of 460 nm and emission wavelength of 540-560 nm.<br>
Enzyme preparation:<br>
Preparation of the partially purified HSL:<br>
Isolated rat fat cells are obtained from epididymal adipose tissue from untreated male rats (Wistar, 220-250 g) by collagenase treatment in accordance with published methods (e.g. S. Nilsson et al., Anal. Biochem. 158, 1986, 399-407; G. Fredrikson et al., J. Biol. Chem. 256, 1981, 6311-6320; H. Tornquist et al., J. Biol. Chem. 251, 1976, 813-819). The fat cells from 10 rats are washed three times by flotation with 50 ml of homogenization buffer (25 ml Tris/HCI, pH 7.4, 0.25 M sucrose, 1 mM ETDA, 1 mM DTT, 10 ^g/ml leupeptin, 10 jag/ml antipain, 20 jag/ml pepstatin) each time and finally taken up in 10 ml of homogenization buffer. The fat cells are homogenized in a Teflon-in-glass homogenizer (Braun-Melsungen) by 10 strokes at 1500 rpm and 15°C. The homogenate is centrifuged (Sorvall SM24 tubes, 5000 rpm, 10 min, 4°C). The subnatant between the layer of fat at the top and the pellet is removed and the centrifugation is repeated. The subnatant resulting therefrom is centrifuged again (Sorvall SM24 tubes, 20 000 rpm, 45 min, 4°C). The subnatant is removed, and 1 g of heparin-Sepharose (Pharmacia-Biotech, CL-6B, washed 5x with 25 mM Tris/HCI, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCI) is added. After incubation at 4°C for 60 min (shaking at intervals of 15 min), the<br><br>
mixture is centrifuged (Sorvall SM24 tubes, 3000 rpm, 10 min, 4°C). The supernatant is adjusted to pH 5.2 by adding glacial acetic acid and is incubated at 4°C for 30 min. The precipitates are collected by centrifugation (Sorvall SS34, 12 000 rpm, 10 min, 4°C) and suspended in 2.5 ml of 20 mM Tris/HCI, pH 7.0, 1 mM EDTA, 65 mM NaCI, 13% sucrose, 1 mM DTT, 10 ^ig/ml leupeptin/pepstatin/antipain. The suspension is dialyzed against 25 mM Tris/HCI, pH 7.4, 50% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 10(ig/ml leupeptin, pepstatin, antipain at 4°C overnight and then loaded onto a hydroxiapatite column (0.1 g per 1 ml of suspension, equilibrated with 10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 30% glycerol, 1 mM DTT). The column is washed with four volumes of equilibration buffer at a flow rate of 20 to 30 ml/h. The HSL is eluted with one volume of equilibration buffer containing 0.5 M potassium phosphate and then dialyzed (see above) and concentrated 5- to 10-fold by ultrafiltration (Amicon Diaflo PM 10 Filter) at 4°C. The partially purified HSL can be stored at -70°C for 4 to 6 weeks.<br>
Assay:<br>
To prepare the substrate, 25-50 ^Ci of [3H]trioleoylglycerol (in toluene), 6.8 nmol of unlabeled trioleoylglycerol and 0.6 mg of phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylinositol 3:1 w/v) are mixed, dried over N2 and then taken up in 2 ml of 0.1 M KPi (pH 7.0) by ultrasound treatment (Branson 250, microtip, setting 1-2, 2 x 1 min with an interval of 1 min). After addition of 1 ml of KPi and renewed ultrasound treatment (4 x 30 sec on ice with intervals of 30 sec), 1 ml of 20% BSA (in KPi) is added (final concentration of trioleoylglycerol 1.7 mM). For the reaction, 100 ^l of substrate solution are pipetted into 100 ^l of HSL solution (HSL prepared as above, diluted in 20 mM KPi, pH 7.0, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.02% BSA, 20 jig/ml pepstatin, 10 ng/ml leupeptin) and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. Addition of 3.25 ml of methanol/chloroform/heptane (10:9:7) and of 1.05 ml of 0.1 M K2C03, 0.1 M boric acid (pH 10.5) is<br><br>
followed by thorough mixing and finally centrifugation (800 x g, 20 min). After phase separation, one equivalent of the upper phase (1 ml) is removed and the radioactivity is determined by liquid scintillation measurement.<br>
Evaluation:<br>
Substances are normally tested in four independent mixtures. The inhibition of the HSL enzymatic activity by a test substance is determined by comparing with an uninhibited control reaction. The IC50 is calculated from an inhibition plot with min. 10 concentrations of the test substance. The GRAPHIT, Elsevier-BIOSOFT software package is used to analyze the data.<br>
The compounds of Examples 1 to 55 showed inhibitions in the IC50 range 0.04-5 \xM in this assay.<br>
The following example describe the invention in more detail without restricting it.<br>
Examples:<br>
The example which follow were prepared according to the methods<br>
described in what follows:<br>
Method A:<br>
To a solution of 2 mmol of 1 H-benzotriazole in pyridine (5 ml) and dichloromethane (10 ml) is added a solution of the corresponding carbamoyl chloride (1 mmol) in dichloromethane (10 ml). The reaction mixture is stirred at RT for 16 h, then admixed with EtOAc (15 ml), and filtered through silica gel before the filtrate is concentrated. The product is purified by preparative HPLC and freeze dried.<br><br>
Method B Examples:<br>
a)	Preparation of a benzotriazole-1-carbonyl chloride solution<br>
A solution of benzotriazole (6g, 50.4 mmol) in THF (100 ml) is added dropwise to a phosgene solution (20% in toluene; 90 ml; 182 mmol) while cooling in ice. The ice bath is removed and the solution is then stirred at RT for a further 2 h. The solvent is distilled out and the residue is taken up in THF to give a total volume of 25 ml.<br>
b)	Reaction of the benzotriazolecarbonyl chlorides to give the<br>
corresponding benzotriazole-1-carboxamides and anilides<br>
In each case 10 amines or anilines (2 mmol) are introduced into THF (1 ml), and pyridine (0.2 ml) is added. The mixtures are incubated with benzotriazole-1-carbonyl chloride solution (1 ml, ~ 2 mmol) and stirred at RT for 16 h. The mixtures are then diluted with ethyl acetate (5 ml) and filtered through silica gel, and the filtrate is evaporated to dryness in vacuo. The crude products are purified by flash chromatography.<br>
