FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the prepanition of ihe compound<br>
{E)	N.N-DIETHYL-2-CYANO-3(3.4-DIHYDROXY-5-NlTROPHCNYL)<br>
ACRYLAMIDE having the structure of Formula-IV. Particularly the invention relates to a process for the preparation of (C) N.N-DlETHYL-2-CYANO-3(3.4-DIHYDROXY-5-NlTR0PHENYL)ACRYLAMlDE which is efficient and Industrial advantageous. The said compound of the present invention is known as Hntacapone.<br>
 <br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Catechol-0-methyltransferase (COMT) one of the important enzyme involved in metabolism of catecholamines, Highest activity was found in the liver, kidney and intestine even though it is present both in periphery and the central nervous system of most of the tissues. COMT a important enzyme in the extra neuronal inaclivation of drugs with catechol structure and catecholasmines,<br>
GB 8.727854 teaches (H) N.N-DIETHYL-2-CYANO-3(3.4-DIHYDROXY-5-NITROPHENYDACRYLAMIDE f ENf ACAPONE] for the treatment of Parkinson's disease as a potential inhibitor of catechol-0-methyl- transferase    (COMT) enzyme.<br>
US patent number 4.963.590 (1990) and GB 2200109 (1987) describes the condensation of 3,4-dihydroxy-5-nitrobenzaldehyde with N,N-diethyl cyano acetamide using ethano!<br>
2<br>
 <br>
media in presence of catahsl piperidine acetate [scheme 11 and isolation of mixture of E (70 to 80%) and Z( 30-20%) isomers of Hntacaponc,<br>
 <br>
US patent number 5,131.950 (1992) reported the structure of E and Z isomer along with polymorphic forms A and B and claims the process for the isomerization of Z isomer also conversion of unstable polymorphic form B to form A [scheme 2]<br>
J<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Intemaiional publication number WO 2005/063693 claims the improved process for the preparation of Rntacaponc startiiiji from 3-alkoxy-4-hydroxy-5-nilro benzaldehyde condensation with other intermediate N,N-diethylaminocyanoacetatTiide in presence of mild acid catalyst followed by de- alkylation [scheme-j]. Another application WO/2005 070881 claimed for an efficient procedure for the preparation of (E) Entacapone stable polymorphic Form A by simple extracfion of E isomer from the mixture of E and Z isomer from aqueous acidic media at pH 3,5 to 4.0.<br>
4<br>
 <br>
 <br>
The process of innovator is disadvantageous in that it requires isolation of mixture of E and Z isomers and further treatment with formic acid or acetic acid in presence of hydrobromic acid to get pure H isomer.<br>
■fhe above process requires longer reaction times and uses hazardous and corrosive acids as a solvent for purification.<br>
f'urther the innovators process involves the disadvantage of isolation of mixture of isomers and polymorphic forms and needs additional purification to get a stable polymorph A and desired 0 isomer (pure enough). Lengthy process (liming) and isolation of mixture isomers are the major disadvantages for this process. To overcome this<br>
5<br>
 <br>
disadvantage other process were claimed with modifications involving more either starting from costl&gt; /excess raw material or using additional solvents with lengthy reaction timings.<br>
Process starting from j-alkox\-4-hydroxy -5-nitro pyridine, starting from expensive 3-ethoxy compound is not economically feasible. This process also involves usage of hazardous chlorinated chemical like aluminium chloride and pyridine in final stage and also additional solvents like methylene chloride and Pyridine. It's not advisable to use solvents like pyridine is final stages and it's difficult to remove completeh from ihe product where residual solvents presence is critical for a high dosage drugs litce Entacapone. Reaction time also too longer like inventors process.<br>
Process claiming extraction of E isomer from the reaction mixture also involved excess quantities of one of the intermediate (cyano acetamide) almost double the mole ratio and longer reaction hours.<br>
it is therefore an object of the present invention to overcome the drawbacks of the processes of prior art and to provide a simple and efilcient process for producing stable polymorph A with pure R isomer substantially free from Z-isomer.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION:<br>
Thus according to ihc present invention there is provided an improved process for the preparation of the compound (E) N.N-DIETHYL-2-CYANO-3(3,4-DlHYDROXY-5-NITROPHENYDACRYLAMiDE having the structure of  Formula -!V comprising:<br>

0.2%.<br>
