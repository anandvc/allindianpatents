ARC WELDING PROCESS<br>
In the electro welding process earth is given to the material to be welded and phase is supplied to the holder which holds the welding rod. When these two touch each other, the electro rod in the holder melts, due to the high temperature formed at the point of arc produced and joints the metal pieces by melting the metal this process is called " Arc Welding"<br>
MIG WELDING PROCESS<br>
In the process of Mig Welding earth is given to the metallic plates to be welded and phase is given to the holder in which welding rod is attached. Required quantity of gas is also supplied through the holder. In this condition, when we touch the rod to the metal the welding rod melts to joint the plates correctly.<br>
REQUIREMENTS :<br>
I.	Mig welding gas :<br>
a)	Carbon di Oxide (Co,)<br>
b)	Argon Gas.<br><br>
II.	Mig - Metal Inner Gas Welding<br>
III.	Mig - Copper Coated Welding rod.<br>
IV.	Thickness of rod : 0.8 mm or 1.2 mm<br>
Rays Produced during welding<br>
a)	Ultraviolet Rays<br>
b)	Infrared Rays.<br><br>
SPOT WELDING PROCESS<br>
When we are doing the spot welding for joining the two Iron plates, one part of holder is supplied with earth and the other part with phase.Water is continuously supplied to the holder to prevent the copper tip from heat to melt. Air is supplied for correct movement of the spot welding holder.<br>
During this process, the two metal plates melt at the point of joint and joints with each other successfully.<br>
■r<br>
In this welding process, the radiation is very much low compared to other two processes.<br>
RADIATION FROM WELDING PROCESSES<br>
In all above welding processes electrical vibratory waves are formed when the earth and phase touch each other. These waves are called as welding rays. These contains ultra<br>
violet and infrared radiations as a major portion which are harmful fpr eyes given in fig 2<br><br>
PROBLEM FACED BY WELDING RADIATIONS<br>
The Ultraviolet ray and the Infrared ray emitted during the welding process affect the person who is welded or the person who see the radiations with direct sight in the following ways.<br>
i) The retina of the eye is affected and the whiteness of the eye change to red in colour.<br>
ii) The eye is irritated. The irritation is similar to the irritation when sand particles fall into the eye.<br>
iii)	Due to the irritation the person cannot close his eye-lid.<br>
iv)	Large amount of tears fleded out from the eye.<br>
v)	The person cannot sleep as normal.<br>
vi)	The person cannot view the light from electric blub, Sun, T.V, Computer, Etc.,<br>
vii) The nervous system in the brain can be affected if the person see the radiation with naked eye for a long time.<br>
The above mentioned problems can be rectified if a person used the Chemical Coated glass, in the said invention during welding. The process of making filter glass for welding purpose and its action are explained hereafter.<br><br>
PROCESS OF MAKING CHEMICAL COATED PLATE.<br>
STAGE - I CLEANING OF ALUM (FIG -A)<br>
Place the required quantity of alum (Fig : A : c) (Pottasuim Aluminium Sulphate) in a glass beaker, (Fig : A : a) Fill the cow urine upto the level till the alum sink in the cow urine (Fig : A : b) Keep it for 3 hours. Then remove it and wash with water. Then remove excess<br>
water by rubbing with cotton waste and dried it in absence of sunlight.<br>
«<br>
Repeat the above process two more times after drying the cleaned alum piece. Thus the impurities are washed away and we get the pure alum which know ready for making the<br>
solution.<br>
The alum used in the above process was subjected to analytecal test from the analytical test report we inferred that the concentration of the alum is increased by 0.08% W/W due to the above cleaning process.<br>
The test report is as given below.<br>
A)	BEFORE CLEANING THE ALUM : Water soluble aluminium     -	16.16% W/W Compound as Al2O3<br>
B)	AFTER CLEANING BY THE ABOVE PROCESS :<br>
Water soluble aluminium     -	16.24% W/W<br><br><br>
STAGE - II POWDERING OF ALUM (FIG -B)<br>
As shown in the Fig-B, the cleaned alum (Fig : B : a) is dried in air in the absence of Sun light.<br>
Then the dried cleaned alum is powdered well. (Fig : B : b)<br>
STAGE - III SOLUTION MAKE UP PROCESS (FIG -C)<br>
Take 100ml of water in a glass beaker (Fig : C : a) and add 25gm of powdered alum (from Stage - II). Stirr it well to dissolve it and keep it for 15 minutes. Now the alum solution (Fig : C : b) is ready for use.<br>
STAGE - IV MAKING OF CHEMICAL COATED PLATE<br>
Take two glass plates or plastic glasses or fibre glass in required dimensions and coat the alum mixture by gently applying on the plate using a sponge.<br>
Then dried it in the absence of Sunlight for 30 minutes. After drying joint the coated glass surface and another similar uncoated glass surface together by applying gum at the edge of the plate. Now it is ready to use for welding purposes. These welding glasses canbe used for a long time, usage.<br>
This glass filters the Ultraviolet radiations and Infrared radiations by absorping them and gives us the filtered ray. This filtered ray is called as 'F-Ray' hereafter.<br><br>
MERITS OF USING THIS CHEMICAL COATED GLASS OVER THE TRADITIONAL GLASS<br>
A normal welding glass is shown in fig 1.<br>
The following problems are faced by a person when using existing wel<br>
*<br>
i)       This cannot successfully prevents the Ultraviolet and Infrared Rays emitted during<br>
welding.<br>
ii)      The eye is affected if welding is done for a long time.<br>
iii)     So welding is done for a restricted level and restricted time when we are using this glass.<br>
iv)     There may be chances for affecting the nervous system in the brain.<br>
v)      It is impossible to see the light from electric bulb. Sunlight, T.V. Computer, Etc., for long time.<br>
The above mentioned problems are successfully over come if a person using this chemical coated glass said in this invention.<br><br>
WORKING PROCEDURES<br>
EXPLANATION FOR FIG-I<br>
WELDING<br>
During welding we place the chemical coated glass (Fig : I: d) in between the eye (Fig : I: f) and the welding arc (Fig : I: a) and see the arc through this glass plate as shown in the diagram. So the Ultraviolet radiation (Fig : I: b) and Infrared radiation (Fig: I: c) emitted from the welding arc reaches the glass plate before reaching the eye.<br>
When the welding rays passes through the chemical coated glass plate, The unpolarized rays in the welding rays are subjected to polarisation by the alum crystals formed between the glass plates. Thus the unpolarized rays are converted into polarized rays which are called as 'F-ray' (Fig : I : e). This ray is safe to the eye and the person during the welding.<br>
WORKING PROCEDURES<br>
EXPLANATION FOR FIG-II<br>
COMPUTER<br>
Electrons blue coloured ray (Fig : II : d) green coloured ray (Fig : II : c) and red coloured ray (Fig : II : b) are emitted from the computers (Fig : II : a) These affect persons, (Fig : II: g) who are doing the work before computers, mentally and physically.<br>
If we place the chemical coated glass (Fig : II: e) in front of the computer, the unwanted radiations which emitted from the computers are absorbed in the glass plate and the ray penetrating through this chemical coated glass plate is filtered. This emergent ray from glass plate (Fig : II : f) is called as 'F-Ray') (Filtered ray). This F-Ray is safe to human beings.<br><br>
WORKING PROCEDURES<br>
EXPLANATION FOR FIG-III<br>
COLOUR T.V.<br>
Electros red ray (Fig : III: b) Green ray (Fig : III: c) and blue ray (Fig : III: d) are emerged from the picture tube of a colour T.V. (Fig : III: a). This affect the eye of the persons who is viewing the T.V.<br>
If we place the chemical coated glass, (Fig : III : e) in between the person (Fig : III: g) and the T.V these unwanted radiations are absorped by the chemicals in the glass plate and it gives the filtered ray, called as 'F-Ray' (Fig : III: f) which is safe to human beings.<br>
WORKING PROCEDURES<br>
EXPLANATION FOR FIG-IV<br>
SUNLIGHT<br>
The Sunlight (Fig : IV : a) consists of many harmful radiations such as Ultraviolet Ray, Infrared Ray, Gamma Ray, Etc., So it is hard to see the sunlight by our naked eye.<br>
If we see the sunlight throught this chemical coated plate (Fig : IV : b), We can clearly see the sunlight by our eyes. Moreover we can easily see how the radiation is slowely removed and prevented by the chemicals coated in the glass plate.<br>
The Chemicals coated in the glass plate absorbs the harmful radiations and gives out the filtered ray namely 'F-Ray' (Fig : IV : c) which is safe to our eyes<br><br>
WORKING PROCEDURES EXPLANATION FOR FIG-V<br>
X-RAY<br>
This chemical coated plate can also be used for filtering X-rays which is used in diagnosis. This chemical coated glass plate (Fig : V : b) is placed in between the coolidge tube, (Fig : V : a) in which X-Ray is produced, and the person (Fig : V : d) to be diagonised as shown in the diagram. Thus the X-Ray when it passes through this glass is filtered by the chemical coated plate, by absorping the unwanted radiations and atomic particles come along with X-rays and pure filtered X-ray is emerged out of the glass. This filtered X-Ray namely F-Ray (Fig : V : c) is safe when it passes through the body of human beings. Moreover the X-Ray photography taken by this method is also very clear.<br>
WORKING PROCEDURES<br>
EXPLANATION FOR FIG-VI<br>
CT SCAN (COMPUTRRISED TOMOGRAPH)<br>
This chemical coated glass plate (Fig : VI: b) is placed in between the person (Fig : VI : d) to be scanned and the CT Scan Machine (Fig : VI: a). When the incredible ray from the CT Scan machine reaches the chemical coated plate the chemical in the plate absorps the unwanted radiations and gives out filtered ray called F-Ray (Fig : VI: c), This ray is very safe to human beings and the picture are also very clear to see.<br>
WORKING PROCEDURES EXPLANATION FOR FIG-VII<br>
MRI SCAN<br>
If we place the chemical coated plate (Fig : VII: b) in between the MRI Scan machine (Fig : VII : a) and the person (Fig : VII : d) to be scanned, we get filtered ray, called F-Ray (Fig : VII: c), which is very much safe to human beings.<br>
When the magnetic radiation ray from MRI Scan machine reaches the chemical coated glass it absorbs the unwanted atomic particles from the ray and produces filtered ray, called F-Ray. The photography using this F-Ray are very clear.   <br><br>
OBSERVATION<br>
When we observe the Welding rays through this chemical coated plate, we can observe that the unpolarised light emerges out from the welding point is converted to polarised light. There polarized rays formed by the chemical coated plate are not hazarders.<br>
If we rotate the plate, at the time of seeing the welding rays we, can infer that the line formed at the chemical coated surfaces are also rotated along the direction of rotation. By this inference we can prove that the un polarised lights from the welding paint be came<br><br><br><br><br><br>
