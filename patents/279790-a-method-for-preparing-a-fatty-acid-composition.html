				<td>SPECIFICATION PHOSPHATIDIC ACID PHOSPHATASE HOMOLOGS AND USE THEREOF<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]   This specification claims priority to Japanese Patent Application No. 2007-181899<br>
(filed on July 11, 2007).<br>
[0002]   The present invention relates to novel genes for phosphatidic acid phosphatase.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0003]   Fatty acids are important components of lipids such as phospholipids and<br>
triacylglycerols.   Fatty acids containing two or more unsaturated bonds are collectively<br>
referred to as polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and are known to include arachidonic acid,<br>
dihomo-Y-linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid.   Some of these<br>
polyunsaturated fatty acids cannot be synthesized in the animal body, and such<br>
polyunsaturated fatty acids should be taken as essential fatty acids from food sources.<br>
Polyunsaturated fatty acids are widely distributed.   By way of example, arachidonic acid is<br>
separated from lipids extracted from the adrenal glands and/or livers of animals.   However,<br>
the amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids contained in animal organs is small and cannot be<br>
obtained sufficiently for large supplies when simply extracted or separated from animal<br>
organs.   For this reason, microbial techniques have been developed for obtaining<br>
polyunsaturated fatty acids by culturing various microorganisms.   Above all,<br>
microorganisms of the genus Mortierella are known to produce lipids containing arachidonic<br>
acid and other polyunsaturated fatty acids.<br>
[0004]   Other attempts have also been made to produce polyunsaturated fatty acids in plants.<br>
Polyunsaturated fatty acids constitute storage lipids such as triacylglycerols and are known to<br>
be accumulated within microorganism cells or plant seeds.<br>
[0005]   Triacylglycerols, which are storage lipids, are produced in vivo as follows.   Acyl<br>
group transfer occurs on glycerol-3-phosphate by gIycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase to<br>
form lysophosphatidic acid, on which acyl group transfer further occurs by lysophosphatidic<br>
 <br>
acid acyltransferase to form phosphatidic acid.   This phosphatidic acid is, in turn, dephosphorylated by phosphatidic acid phosphatase to form diacylglycerol, on which acyl group transfer then occurs by diacylglycerol acyltransferase to form triacylglycerol. [0006]   In the above pathway, phosphatidic acid (hereinafter also referred to as "PA" or "l,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate") serves not only as a precursor of triacylglycerol, but also as a precursor of diacyl-type glycerophospholipid biosynthesis.   In yeast or other microbes, phosphatidic acid cytidyltransferase acts on PA and cytidine 5'-triphosphate (CTP) to synthesize CDP-diacylglycerol (CDP-DG), which in turn is used for biosynthesis of various phospholipids.<br>
[0007]   As described above, dephosphorylation of PA for biosynthesis of diacylglycerol (hereinafter also referred to as "DG") is known to be catalyzed by phosphatidic acid phosphatase (E.G. 3.1.3.4; hereinafter also referred to as "PAP").   This PAP enzyme is known to be present in all organisms ranging from bacteria to vertebrate animals.   Moreover, in fungi, PAP is a key enzyme for biosynthesis of triacylglycerols (which are storage lipids) starting from PA.<br>
[0008]   The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is a fungus, is known to have two types of PAP (Non-patent Document 1).    One is Mg^*-dependent PAP (PAPl) and the other is Mg"*-independent PAP (PAP2).   As a gene encoding the former, the PAHl gene has been known.   However, since pahlA mutants have PAPl activity, there are other potential genes responsible for PAPl activity.   On the other hand, as genes encoding the latter, the DPPl and LPPl genes have been known and they are substantially responsible for PAP2 activity in yeast.   Enzymes encoded by these genes have wide substrate specificity and are known to also act on diacylglycerol pyrophosphate (DGPP), lysophosphatidic acid, sphingoid base phosphate, isoprenoid phosphate and so on to cause dephosphorylation thereof. [0009]   In other fungi, the presence of these homologs has been confirmed, but there is no report of their functions, etc.<br>
[0010]   In a lipid-producing fungus, Mortierella alpina, its microsomal fraction has been known to have PAP activity (Non-patent Document 2).<br>
 <br>
Non-patent Document 1: Trends Biochem. Sci., 31(12), 694-699, 2006 Non-patent Document 2: Biochemical Society Transactions, 28, 707-709, 2000 DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
[0011]   However, PAP genes previously reported have not been studied for their ability to alter the fatty acid rate of fatty acid compositions produced by host cells in which these PAP genes are introduced and expressed.   There is a need to identify a novel gene which allows production of fats and oils with a desired fatty acid rate and/or enrichment of desired fatty acids by being introduced into or expressed in host cells. MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS<br>
[0012]   The object of the present invention is to provide a protein or nucleic acid which allows production of fats and oils with a desired fatty acid rate and/or enrichment of desired fatty acids by being expressed in or introduced into host cells. [0013]   To achieve the above object, the inventors of the present invention have made extensive and intensive efforts.   First, EST analysis was performed on a lipid-producing fungus, Mortierella alpina, to extract sequences sharing high identity with known PAP genes. To obtain the entire open reading frame (ORF) encoding PAP, genes were further cloned by cDNA library screening or PCR.   As a result of attempting to introduce these genes into â€¢ highly proliferative host cells (e.g., yeast cells) to thereby produce a desired fatty acid composition, the inventors succeeded in cloning a gene related to a novel PAP which allows production of a fatty acid composition different from that produced by a host not canying the gene.   This led to the completion of the present invention.   Namely, the present invention is as follows.<br>

[0019]   The PAP of the present invention allows a host to produce a fatty acid composition whose fatty acid rate differs from that of a fatty acid composition produced by a host not carrying PAP.   As a result, the PAP of the present invention enables the provision of lipids having desired properties and effects, and is useful as being applicable to foods, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, soaps, etc.<br>
[0020]   Moreover, the PAP of the present invention allows improvement in the ability to produce fatty acids and storage lipids, and hence is preferred as a means for improving the productivity of polyunsaturated fatty acids in microorganisms and plants. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0021]   Figure 1 shows the cDNA sequence of MaPAPl according to the present invention, along with its deduced amino acid sequence.<br>
Figure 2 shows an alignment of the deduced amino acid sequence of MaPAPlp (SEQ ID NO: 2) with the amino acid sequences of PAP2 family proteins.   In the figure, the three double-underlined segments represent consensus regions conserved among PAP2 family enzymes, and "*" represents an amino acid residue essential for PAP activity. BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0022]   The present invention relates to novel genes for phosphatidic acid phosphatase derived from the genus Mortierella, characterized by dephosphorylating phosphatidic acid to generate diacylglycerol. [0023]   Phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP) in the present invention is an enzyme that<br>
 <br>
catalyzes a reaction in which phosphatidic acid is dephosphorylated to generate diacylglycerol.   A substrate for PAP in the present invention is generally, but not limited to, phosphatidic acid. [0024]   Nucleic acids of the present invention encoding phosphatidic acid phosphatase<br>
Phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP) in the present invention encompasses MaPAPl.   The correspondence between cDNA, CDS, ORF and amino acid sequences of a nucleic acid encoding MaPAPl is summarized in Table 1 below.<br>
 <br>
Namely, sequences related to the PAP of the present invention include SEQ ID NO: 2 (amino acid sequence of MaPAPl), SEQ ID NO: 4 (sequence representing the ORF region of MaPAPl), SEQ ID NO: 3 (sequence representing the CDS region of MaPAPl) and SEQ ID NO: 1 (nucleotide sequence of cDNA for MaPAPl).   Among them, SEQ ID NO: 3 corresponds to nucleotides 105-1223 of SEQ ID NO: 1, while SEQ ID NO: 4 corresponds to nucleotides 105-1220 of SEQ ID NO: 1 or nucleotides 1-1116 of SEQ ID NO: 3. [0026]   The nucleic acids of the present invention encompass single-stranded and double-stranded DNAs as well as complementary RNAs thereof, which may be either naturally occurring or artificially prepared.    DNAs include, but are not limited to, genomic DNAs, cDNAs corresponding to the genomic DNAs, chemically synthesized DNAs, PCR-ampIified DNAs, as well as combinations thereof and DNA/RNA hybrids. [0027]   Preferred embodiments for the nucleic acids of the present invention include (a) the<br>
 <br>
nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 4, (b) a nucleotide sequence encoding a protein consisting of the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 2, and (c) the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1.<br>
[0028]   The above nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 4, nucleotide sequence encoding a protein consisting of the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 2, and nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1 are as shown in Table 1. [0029]   To obtain these nucleotide sequences, nucleotide sequence data of ESTs or genomic DNAs from organisms having PAP activity may be used to search a nucleotide sequence encoding a protein sharing high identity with known proteins having PAP activity. Preferred organisms having PAP activity are lipid-producing fungi including, but not limited to, M. alpina.<br>
[0030]   For EST analysis, a cDNA library is first prepared.   As to techniques for cDNA library preparation, reference may be made to "Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual 3rd ed." (Cold Spring Harbor Press (2001)).   Alternatively, a commercially available cDNA library preparation kit may be used.   Techniques for cDNA library preparation suitable for the present invention are as follows, by way of example.   Namely, an appropriate strain of M. alpina, a lipid-producing fungus, is inoculated into an appropriate medium and pre-cultured for an appropriate period.   Culture conditions suitable for this pre-culture include, for example, medium composition of 1,8% glucose, 1% yeast extract and pH 6.0, a culture period of 3 days, and a culture temperature of 28Â°C.   The pre-cultured product is then subjected to main culture under appropriate conditions.   Medium composition suitable for main culture may be, for example, 1.8% glucose, 1% soybean powder, 0.1% olive oil, 0.01% Adekanol, 0.3% KH2PO4, 0.1% Na2S04,0.05% Caa2-2H20,0.05% MgCl2-6H20 and pH 6.0.   Culture conditions suitable for main culture may be, for example, aerobic spinner culture at 300 rpm, 1 vvm, 26'C for 8 days.    An appropriate amount of glucose may be added during culture.   The cultured product is sampled at appropriate time points during main culture, from which the cells are then collected to prepare total RNA.   For preparation of total RNA, it is possible to use any known technique, such as guanidine<br>
 <br>
hydrochloride/CsCl method.   The resulting total RNA may be treated with a commercially available kit to purify poly(A)"^RNA,   Further, a cDNA library may be prepared with a commercially available kit.   Then, any clone from the cDNA library thus prepared is determined for its nucleotide sequence by using primers which are designed on a vector to allow determination of the nucleotide sequence of an insert.   As a result, ESTs can be obtained.   For example, when a 21AP-cDNA Gigapacklll Gold Cloning Kit (STRATAGENE) is used for cDNA library preparation, directional cloning can be performed. [0031]   When analyzed by BLASTX, the MaPAPl gene of the present invention shares 57,4% identity with a nucleotide sequence encoding a Neurospora cra^^o-derived diacylglycerol pyrophosphate phosphatase (DPPl) homolog (Accession No. CAD70721) having the lowest E-value (i.e., showing the highest identity) and shares 59.3% identity with the amino acid sequence of this homolog.<br>
[0032]   The present invention also encompasses nucleic acids functionally equivalent to a nucleic acid comprising the above nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 4 (hereinafter also referred to as "the nucleotide sequence of the present invention") or nucleotide sequence encoding a protein consisting of the amino acid sequence shovra in SEQ ID NO: 2 (hereinafter also referred to as "the amino acid sequence of the present invention").   The phrase "functionally equivalent" is intended to mean that a protein encoded by the nucleotide sequence of the present invention or a protein consisting of the amino acid sequence of the present invention has PAP activity.   In addition to this PAP activity, a protein encoded by the nucleotide sequence of the present invention or a protein consisting of the amino acid sequence of the present invention may have the ability to yield a fatty acid rate ensuring a higher ratio of at least one or more of:<br>
i) the oleic acid content;<br>
ii) the ratio of the palmitoleic acid content to the palmitic acid content;<br>
iii) the ratio of the oleic acid content to the palmitic acid content;<br>
iv) the ratio of the total content of stearic acid and oleic acid to the palmitic acid content;<br>
 <br>
v) the ratio of the Cis fatty acid content to the Cie fatty acid content; and<br>
vi) the ratio of the arachidonic acid, dihomo-y-linolenic acid and/or y-linolenic acid content<br>
in the fatty acid rate of a host expressing the protein than in the fatty acid rate of a host not expressing the protein (such a protein is hereinafter also referred to as a "protein having the ability to yield the fatty acid rate of PAP in the present invention"). [0033]   A specific example is a nucleic acid comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a protein having the ability to yield a fatty acid rate satisfying at least one or more of the following:<br>
i) the oleic acid content is 46% or more, preferably 48% or more, 50% or more, 52% or more, 54% or more;<br>
ii) the ratio of the palmitoleic acid content to the palmitic acid content is 7.0 or more, preferably 8.0 or more, 8.5 or more;<br>
iii) the ratio of the oleic acid content to the palmitic acid content is 7.5 or more, preferably 8.0 or more, 10.0 or more, 12.0 or more, 13.0 or more;<br>
iv) the ratio of the total content of stearic acid and oleic acid to the palmitic acid content is 8,0 or more, preferably 10.0 or more, 12.0 or more, 14.0 or more, 14.5 or more;<br>
v) the ratio of the Cis fatty acid content to the Ci6 fatty acid content is 1.1 or more, preferably 1.2 or more, 1.3 or more, 1.4 or more; and<br>
vi) the arachidonic acid content is 0.45 or more, preferably 0.50 or more, 0.53 or more, 0.55 or more, the dihomo-y-linolenic acid content is 0.34 or more, preferably 0.40 or more, 0,42 or more, 0.45 or more, and/or the y-linolenic acid content is 0.55 or more, preferably 0.65 or more, 0.67 or more, 0.70 or more, 0.75 or more (the above numerics each denote a ratio to total fatty acid when the PAP gene of the present invention is expressed in arachidonic acid-producing yeast cells),<br>
when the above nucleotide sequence of the present invention is inserted into expression vector pYE22m (Biosci. Biotech. Biochem., 59,1221-1228,1995) and transformed into a yeast host, Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain EH13-15 (Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol., 30,<br>
 <br>
515-520,1989), and the resulting transformant is cultured to collect the cells, which are then analyzed for fatty acids by the procedures described in Example 6 below.   More preferred is a nucleic acid comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a protein having both PAP activity and the above ability to yield the fatty acid rate of PAP in the present invention. [0034]   One of the characteristic features in the fatty acid composition of the present invention is high arachidonic acid content.   Arachidonic acid, a substance represented by the chemical formula C20H32O2 and having a molecular weight of 304.47, is a carboxylic acid containing 20 carbon atoms and 4 double bonds ([20:4(n-6)]) and classified as a member of the (n-6) series.   Arachidonic acid is present as an important phospholipid (particularly phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol) in animal cell membranes and is contained in abundance in the brain.   Moreover, arachidonic acid serves as a starting material for a series of eicosanoids (e.g., prostaglandin, thromboxane, leukotriene) generated by the arachidonic acid cascade, and is also important as a second messenger in intercellular signaling.   On the other hand, arachidonic acid is synthesized from linolic acid in the animal body.   However, depending on their species or age, some animals do not exert this function sufficiently to produce the required amount of arachidonic acid or have no function to produce arachidonic acid.   Thus, arachidonic acid should be taken from food sources and can be regarded as an essential fatty acid. [0035]   The arachidonic acid content in the fatty acid composition of the present invention may be measured as follows, by way of example.   Namely, a plasmid for PAP of the present invention is inserted into a vector such as pDuraSC or pDuraSMCS, as described in Example 8, and transformed into a M alpina strain.   The resulting transformant is allowed to express and cultured according to the procedures described in Example 8.   The cultured cells thus obtained are used to measure the fatty acid content in the cells and/or the arachidonic acid content per medium, etc.   To analyze the arachidonic acid content, etc., for example, fatty acids in the resulting cultured cells are derived into corresponding fatty acid methyl esters by the hydrochloric acid/methanol method, and then extracted with hexane.   After distilling off hexane, the fatty acids are analyzed by gas chromatography.   According to this analysis, M<br>
 <br>
alpina transformed with the PAP of the present invention has been found to show not only<br>
high fatty acid content in the cells, but also high arachidonic acid production per medium.<br>
Thus, the fatty acid composition of the present invention having high arachidonic acid<br>
content is prefened because it enables the efficient intake of arachidonic acid.<br>
[0036]   Another characteristic feature in the fatty acid composition of the present invention<br>
is high dihomo-y-linolenic acid content.   Dihomo-y-linolenic acid (DGLA), a substance<br>
represented by the chemical formula C20H34O2 and having a molecular weight of 306.48, is a<br>
carboxylic acid containing 20 carbon atoms and 3 double bonds ([20:3(n-6)]) and classified<br>
as a member of the (n-6) series.   DGLA is obtained by elongation of Y-linolenic acid<br>
(18:3(n-6)).    Upon addition of one more double bond to DGLA, arachidonic acid is<br>
generated.<br>
[0037]   Yet another characteristic feature in the fatty acid composition of the present<br>
invention is high y-linolenic acid content,   Y-Linolenic acid, a substance represented by the<br>
chemical formula C18H30O2 and having a molecular weight of 278.436, is a carboxylic acid<br>
containing 18 carbon atoms and 3 double bonds ([18:3(n-6)]) and classified as a member of<br>
the (n-6) series.   Humans have the ability to produce y-linolenic acid from linolic acid<br>
([18:2(n-6)]) through A6 desaturase-catalyzed dehydrogenation, but they often take it from<br>
foods.<br>
[0038]   Such nucleic acids that are functionally equivalent to the nucleic acids of the present<br>
invention include a nucleic acid comprising a nucleotide sequence shown in any one of (a) to<br>
(e) below.   It should be noted that when used to describe the nucleotide sequences listed<br>
below, the phrase "the above activity of the present invention" is intended to mean "PAP<br>
activity and/or the ability to yield the fatty acid rate of PAP in the present invention" defined<br>
above.<br>
[0039]   (a) A nucleotide sequence which encodes a protein consisting of an amino acid<br>
sequence with deletion, substitution or addition of one or more amino acids in the amino acid<br>
sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 2 and having the above activity of the present invention.<br>
Nucleotide sequences contained in the nucleic acids of the present invention include<br>
 <br>
a nucleotide sequence which encodes a protein consisting of an amino acid sequence with deletion, substitution or addition of one or more amino acids in the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 2 and having the above activity of the present invention. [0040]   More specifically, it is a nucleotide sequence which encodes a protein consisting of:<br>
(i) an amino acid sequence with deletion of one or more (preferably one or several (e.g., 1-110,1-100,1-75,1-50,1-30,1-25,1-20,1-15,1-10, more preferably 1-5)) amino acids in the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 2;<br>
(ii) an amino acid sequence with substitution of other amino acids for one or more (preferably one or several (e.g., 1-110,1-100,1-75,1-50,1-30,1-25,1-20,1-15,1-10, more preferably 1-5)) amino acids in the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 2;<br>
(iii) an amino acid sequence with addition of other one or more (preferably one or several (e.g., 1-110,1-100,1-75,1-50,1-30,1-25, 1-20,1-15,1-10, more preferably 1-5)) amino acids in the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 2; or<br>
(iv) an amino acid sequence with any combination of (i) to (iii) above, and having the above activity of the present invention.<br>
[0041]   Among the above modifications, substitution is preferably conservative, which means the replacement of a certain amino acid residue by another residue having similar physical and chemical characteristics.   It may be any substitution as long as it does not substantially alter the structural characteristics of the original sequence.   For example, any substitution is possible as long as the substituted amino acids do not disrupt a helix present in the original sequence or do not disrupt any other type of secondary structure characterizing the original sequence.<br>
[0042]   Conservative substitution is generally introduced by synthesis in biological systems or chemical peptide synthesis, preferably by chemical peptide synthesis.   In this case, substituents may include unnatural amino acid residues, as well as peptidomimetics, and reversed or inverted forms of amino acid sequences in which unsubstituted regions are reversed or inverted. [0043]   Amino acid residues are classified and listed below in groups of mutually<br>
 <br>
substitutable members, but are not limited to the following:<br>
Group A: leucine, isoleucine, norleucine, valine, norvaline, alanine, 2-aminobutanoic acid, methionine, 0-methylserine, t-butylglycine, t-butylalanine and cyclohexylalanine;<br>
Group B: aspartic acid, glutamic acid, isoaspartic acid, isoglutamic acid, 2-aminoadipic acid and 2-aminosuberic acid;<br>
Group C: asparagine and glutamine;<br>
Group D: lysine, arginine, ornithine, 2,4-diaminobutanoic acid and 2,3-diaminopropionic acid;<br>
Group E: proline, 3-hydroxyproline and 4-hydroxyproline;<br>
Group F: serine, threonine and homoserine; and<br>
Group G: phenylalanine and tyrosine.<br>
Non-conservative substitution may involve the exchange of a member of one of the above classes for a member from another class.   In this case, for the purpose of maintaining biological functions of the proteins of the present invention, it is preferable to consider the hydropathic index of amino acids (hydropathic amino acid index) (Kyte et al., J. Mol. Biol., 157:105-131(1982)).<br>
[0044]   In the case of non-conservative substitution, amino acid substitutions may also be accomplished on the basis of hydrophilicity.<br>
[0045]   In the specification and drawings of the present application, nucleotides, amino acids and abbreviations thereof are those according to the lUPAC-IUB Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature or those conventionally used in the art, for example, as described in Immunology-A Synthesis (second edition, edited by E.S. Golub and D.R. Gren, Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, Massachusetts (1991)).   Moreover, amino acids which may have optical isomers are intended to represent their L-isomer, unless otherwise specified. [0046]   Stereoisomers (e.g., D-amino acids) of the above amino acids, unnatural amino acids such as a,a-disubstituted amino acids, N-alkylamino acids, lactic acid, and other unconventional amino acids may also be members constituting the proteins of the present<br>
 <br>
invention.<br>
[0047]   It should be noted that in the protein notation used herein, the lefthand direction is the amino terminal direction and the righthand direction is the carboxy terminal direction, in accordance with standard usage and convention.<br>
[0048]   Similarly, unless otherwise specified, the lefthand end of single-stranded polynucleotide sequences is the 5'-end and the lefthand direction of double-stranded polynucleotide sequences is referred to as the 5' direction.<br>
[0049]   Those skilled in the art would be able to design and prepare appropriate mutants of the proteins described herein by using techniques known in the art.   For example, when targeting a region which appears to be less important for the biological activity of the protein of the present invention, it is possible to identify a suitable region in the protein molecule whose structure can be changed without impairing the biological activity of the protein of the present invention.   It is also possible to identify residues or regions in the molecule, which are conserved between similar proteins.   Moreover, it is also possible to introduce conservative amino acid substitutions into a region which appears to be important for the biological activity or structure of the protein of the present invention, without impairing the biological activity and without adversely affecting the polypeptide structure of the protein. Particularly in the present invention, as double underlined in Figure 2, the amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO: 2) of MaPAPl of the present invention contains, at residues 146-154, 202-205 and 260-264, three consensus regions conserved among Mg^*-independent phosphatidic acid phosphatase 2 (PAP2) family enzymes.   In these three consensus regions conserved among PAP2 family enzymes, arginine in domain 1 and histidines in domains 2 and 3 are known as amino acids essential for activity, and these amino acids are also conserved in MaPAPl of the present invention as arginine at residue 153 and histidines at residues 205 and 260 of SEQ ID NO: 2.    The above consensus regions are essential for PAP2 family enzymes and are also important for the PAP of the present invention.   Thus, mutants according to the present invention are not limited in any way as long as the above consensus regions are conserved.<br>
 <br>
[0050]   Those skilled in the art would be able to conduct a so-called structure-function study which identifies residues, in the protein of the present invention and in a similar peptide thereof, that are important for biological activity or structure, and compares amino acid residues between these two peptides, thereby predicting which residues in the protein similar to the protein of the present invention are amino acid residues corresponding to those important for biological activity or structure.   Moreover, chemically similar amino acid substitutions may be chosen for the amino acid residues thus predicted to thereby select a mutant which retains the biological activity of the protein of the present invention. Likewise, those skilled in the art would also be able to analyze the three-dimensional structure and amino acid sequence of this protein mutant.   The analysis results thus obtained can further be used to predict the alignment of amino acid residues with respect to the three-dimensional structure of the protein.   Since amino acid residues predicted to be on the protein surface may be involved in important interactions with other molecules, those skilled in the art would be able to prepare a mutant which causes no change in these amino acid residues predicted to be on the protein surface, on the basis of analysis results as mentioned above.    Moreover, those skilled in the art would also be able to prepare a mutant having a single amino acid substitution for any of the amino acid residues constituting the protein of the present invention.   These mutants may be screened by any known assay to collect information about the individual mutants, which in turn allows evaluation of the usefulness of individual amino acid residues constituting the protein of the present invention when a comparison is made with the following case where a mutant having substitution of a specific amino acid residue shows lower biological activity than that of the protein of the present invention, where such a mutant shows no biological activity, or where such a mutant produces unsuitable activity to inhibit the biological activity of the protein of the present invention.   Moreover, based on information collected from such routine experiments, those skilled in the art may readily analyze amino acid substitutions undesirable for mutants of the protein of the present invention either alone or in combination with other mutations. [0051]   As described above, a protein consisting of an amino acid sequence with deletion,<br>
 <br>
substitution or addition of one or more amino acids in the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 2 can be prepared according to techniques such as site-directed mutagenesis as described in "Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual 3rd ed." (Cold Spring Harbor Press (2001)), "Current Protocols in Molecular Biology" (John Wiley &amp; Sons (1987-1997), Kunkel (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82: 488-92, and Kunkel (1988) Method. Enzymol. 85: 2763-6,   Preparation of a mutant with such a mutation including amino acid deletion, substitution or addition may be accomplished, for example, by known procedures such as Kunkel method or Gapped duplex method using a mutation-introducing kit based on site-directed mutagenesis such as a QuikChange^^ Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene), a GeneTailor^^ Site-Directed Mutagenesis System (Invitrogen) or a TaKaRa Site-Directed Mutagenesis System (e.g., Mutan-K, Mutan-Super Express Km; Takara Bio Inc., Japan).<br>
[0052]   Techniques for allowing deletion, substitution or addition of one or more amino acids in the amino acid sequences of proteins while retaining their activity include site-directed mutagenesis mentioned above, as well as other techniques such as those for treating a gene with a mutagen, and those in which a gene is selectively cleaved to remove, substitute or add a selected nucleotide or nucleotides, and then ligated. [0053]   A preferred nucleotide sequence contained in the nucleic acids of the present invention is a nucleotide sequence which encodes a protein consisting of an amino acid sequence with deletion, substitution or addition of 1 to 10 amino acids in the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 2 and having PAP activity. [0054]   Moreover, nucleotide sequences contained in the nucleic acids of the present invention also preferably include a nucleotide sequence which encodes a protein consisting of an amino acid sequence with deletion, substitution or addition of 1 to 10 amino acids in SEQ ID NO: 2 and having the above activity of the present invention. [0055]   There is no limitation on the number or sites of amino acid mutations or modifications in the protein of the present invention, as long as the resulting mutant retains PAP activity or the ability to yield the fatty acid rate of PAP in the present invention.<br>
 <br>
[0056]   PAP activity in the present invention or the ability to yield the fatty acid rate of PAP in the present invention can be measured in a known manner.   For example, reference may be made to the following document; J. Biol. Chem., 273,14331-14338 (1998). [0057]   "PAP activity" in the present invention may be measured as follows, by way of example.   A microsomal fraction is prepared from yeast cells transformed to express the PAP of the present invention, as described in, e.g., J. Bacteriology, 173, 2026-2034 (1991). To a reaction solution containing 0.5 mM phosphatidic acid and 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), the above microsomal fraction is then added and reacted at 28Â°C for an appropriate period.   Chloroformtmethanol is added to stop the reaction, followed by lipid extraction.   The resulting lipids are fractionated by thin-layer chromatography or other techniques, whereby the amount of diacylglycerol generated can be quantified. [0058]   Likewise, "the ability to yield the fatty acid rate of PAP" in the present invention may be measured as follows, by way of example.   To lyophilized cells obtained by the method of the present invention for preparing a fatty acid composition, chloroform-.methanol adjusted to an appropriate ratio is added and stirred, followed by heat treatment for an appropriate period.    Centrifugation is further performed to separate the cells and collect the solvent.   This procedure is repeated several times.   Then, lipids are dried up in an appropriate manner, and a solvent such as chloroform is added to dissolve the lipids.   An appropriate aliquot of this sample is treated by the hydrochloric acid/methanol method to derive fatty acids in the cells into corresponding methyl esters, followed by extraction with hexane.   After distilling off hexane, the fatty acids are analyzed by gas chromatography. [0059]   (b) A nucleotide sequence which is hybridizable under stringent conditions with a nucleic acid consisting of a nucleotide sequence complementary to a nucleotide sequence consisting of SEQ ID NO: 4 and which encodes a protein having the above activity of the present invention.<br>
Nucleotide sequences contained in the nucleic acids of the present invention include a nucleotide sequence which is hybridizable under stringent conditions with a nucleic acid consisting of a nucleotide sequence complementary to a nucleotide sequence consisting of<br>
 <br>
SEQ ID NO: 4 and which encodes a protein having the above activity of the present invention.   SEQ ID NO: 4 and PAP activity are as described above. [0060]   To obtain the above nucleotide sequence, a probe may be prepared from an appropriate fragment in a manner known to those skilled in the art, and this probe may be used in known hybridization techniques such as colony hybridization, plaque hybridization or Southern blotting to obtain the nucleotide sequence from a cDNA library, a genomic library or the like.<br>
[0061]   As to detailed procedures for hybridization techniques, reference may be made to "Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual 3rd ed." (Cold Spring Harbor Press (2001); particularly Sections 6-7), "Current Protocols in Molecular Biology" (John Wiley &amp; Sons (1987-1997); particularly Sections 6.3-6.4), "DNA Cloning 1: Core Techniques, A Practical Approach 2nd ed." (Oxford University (1995); particularly Section 2.10 for hybridization conditions).<br>
[0062]   The strength of hybridization is determined primarily by hybridization conditions, more preferably by hybridization conditions and washing conditions.   The term "stringent conditions" as used herein is intended to include moderately or highly stringent conditions. [0063]   More specifically, moderately stringent conditions include, for example, hybridization conditions of 1 x SSC to 6 x SSC at 42Â°C to 55Â°C, more preferably 1 x SSC to 3 X SSC at 45 Â°C to 50'C, and most preferably 2 x SSC at 50Â°C.   In certain cases such as where a hybridization solution contains about 50% formamide, a temperature which is 5'C to 15Â°C lower than the above temperature is used.   Washing conditions may be 0.5 x SSC to 6 X SSC at 40Â°C to 60Â°C.   During hybridization and washing, 0.05% to 0.2% SDS, preferably about 0.1% SDS may usually be added.<br>
[0064]   Highly stringent (high stringent) conditions include hybridization and/or washing at higher temperature and/or lower salt concentration, compared to the moderately stringent conditions.   For example, hybridization conditions may be 0.1 x SSC to 2 x SSC at 55Â°C to 65Â°C, more preferably 0.1 x SSC to 1 x SSC at 60Â°C to 65Â°C, and most preferably 0.2 x SSC at 63Â°C.    Washing conditions may be 0.2 x SSC to 2 x SSC at 50Â°C to 68Â°C, and more<br>
 <br>
preferably 0.2 x SSC at 60Â°C to 65Â°C.<br>
[0065]   Hybridization conditions particularly used in the present invention include, but are not limited to, prehybridization in 5 x SSC, 1% SDS, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 50% formamide at 42Â°C, overnight incubation at 42Â°C in the presence of a probe to form hybrids, and the subsequent three washings in 0.2 x SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65Â°C for 20 minutes. [0066]   It is also possible to use a commercially available hybridization kit which uses no radioactive substance as a probe.    Specific examples include hybridization with a DIG nucleic acid detection kit (Roche Diagnostics) or with an ECL direct labeling &amp; detection system (Amersham).<br>
[0067]   A preferred nucleotide sequence falling within the present invention is a nucleotide sequence which is hybridizable under conditions of 2 x SSC at 50Â°C with a nucleic acid consisting of a nucleotide sequence complementary to a nucleotide sequence consisting of SEQ ID NO: 4 and which encodes a protein having PAP activity. [0068]   (c) A nucleotide sequence which consists of a nucleotide sequence sharing an identity of 70% or more with a nucleotide sequence consisting of SEQ ID NO: 4 and which encodes a protein having the above activity of the present invention.<br>
Nucleotide sequences contained in the nucleic acids of the present invention include a nucleotide sequence which consists of a nucleotide sequence sharing an identity of at least 70% or more with the nucleic acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 4 and which encodes a protein having the above activity of the present invention.<br>
[0069]   Preferred examples include nucleic acids comprising a nucleotide sequence which shares an identity of at least 75%, more preferably 80% (e.g., 85% or more, even more preferably 90% or more, more particulariy 95%, 98% or 99%) with the nucleic acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 4 and which encodes a protein having the above activity of the present invention.<br>
[0070] The percent identity between two nucleic acid sequences can be determined by visual inspection and mathematical calculation, or more preferably by using a computer program to compare sequence information between two nucleic acids.   Computer programs<br>
 <br>
for sequence comparison include, for example, the BLASTN program (Altschul et al. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 215; 403-10) version 2.2.7, available for use via the National Library of Medicine website: http://viww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/bl2seq/bls.html, or the WU-BLAST 2.0 algorithm.   Standard default parameter settings for WU-BLAST 2.0 are described at the following Internet site: http://blast.wustl.edu.<br>
[0071]   (d) A nucleotide sequence which encodes an amino acid sequence sharing an identity of 70% or more with an amino acid sequence consisting of SEQ ID NO: 2 and which encodes a protein having the above activity of the present invention.<br>
Nucleotide sequences contained in the nucleic acids of the present invention include a nucleotide sequence which encodes an amino acid sequence sharing an identity of 70% or more with an amino acid sequence consisting of SEQ ID NO: 2 and which encodes a protein having the above activity of the present invention. Proteins encoded by the nucleic acids of the present invention may also be those sharing identity with the amino acid sequence of MaPAPl, as long as they are functionally equivalent to proteins having the above activity of the present invention.<br>
[0072]   Specific examples include amino acid sequences sharing an identity of 75% or more, preferably 80% or more, more preferably 85%, even more preferably 90% (e.g., 95%, more particularly 98%) with the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 2. [0073]   A preferred nucleotide sequence contained in the nucleic acids of the present invention is a nucleotide sequence which encodes an amino acid sequence sharing an identity of 90% or more with an amino acid sequence consisting of SEQ ID NO: 2 and which encodes a protein having the above activity of the present invention.   More preferred is a nucleotide sequence which encodes an amino acid sequence sharing an identity of 95% or more with an amino acid sequence consisting of SEQ ID NO: 2 and which encodes a protein having the above activity of the present invention.<br>
[0074]   The percent identity between two amino acid sequences may be determined by visual inspection and mathematical calculation.   Alternatively, the percent identity may be determined by using a computer program^   Examples of such a computer program include<br>

BLAST, FASTA (Altschul et al., J, Mol. Biol., 215:403-410 (1990)) and ClustalW.   In particular, various conditions (parameters) for an identity search with the BLAST program are described by Altschul et al. (Nucl. Acids. Res., 25, p.3389-3402,1997) and publicly available via the website of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) or the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) (BLAST Manual, Altschul et al., NCB/NLM/NIH Bethesda, MD 20894; Altschul et al.).   It is also possible to use a program such as genetic information processing software GENETYX Ver.7 (Genetyx Corporation, Japan), DINASIS Pro (Hitachisoft, Japan) or Vector NTI (Infomax) for determination of the percent identity. [0075]   Certain alignment schemes for aligning amino acid sequences may also result in matching of a specific short region of the sequences, and it is also possible to detect a region with very high sequence identity in such a small aligned region even when there is no significant relationship between the full-length sequences used.   In addition, the BLAST algorithm uses the BLOSUM62 amino acid scoring matrix, and optional parameters that can be used are as follows: (A) inclusion of a filter to mask segments of the query sequence that have low compositional complexity (as determined by the SEG program of Wootton and Federhen (Computers and Chemistry, 1993); also see Wootton and Federhen, 1996, "Analysis of compositionally biased regions in sequence databases," Methods Enzymol, 266: 554-71) or segments consisting of short-periodicity internal repeats (as determined by the XNU program of Claverie and States (Computers and Chemistry, 1993)), and (B) a statistical significance threshold for reporting matches against database sequences, or E-score (the expected probability of matches being found merely by chance, according to the stochastic model of Karlin and Altschul, 1990; if the statistical significance ascribed to a match is greater than this E-score threshold, the match will not be reported). [0076]   (e) A nucleotide sequence which is hybridizable under stringent conditions with a nucleic acid consisting of a nucleotide sequence complementary to a nucleotide sequence encoding a protein consisting of the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 2 and which encodes a protein having the above activity of the present invention.<br>

[0077]   Such a protein consisting of the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 2 and hybridization conditions are as described above.   Nucleotide sequences contained in the nucleic acids of the present invention include a nucleotide sequence which is hybridizable under stringent conditions with a nucleic acid consisting of a nucleotide sequence complementary to a nucleotide sequence encoding a protein consisting of the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 2 and which encodes a protein having the above activity of the present invention.<br>

(iii) a nucleotide sequence with addition of other one or more (preferably one or several (e.g., 1-330,1-300,1-250,1-200,1-150,1-100,1-50,1-30,1-25,1-20,1-15,1-10, more preferably 1-5)) nucleotides in the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 4; or<br>

The proteins of the present invention, which may be either naturally occurring or artificially prepared, include a protein consisting of the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 2 and proteins fimctionally equivalent to this protein.   Such a protein consisting of the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 2 is as described above.   "Proteins functionally equivalent" are intended to mean proteins having "the above activity of the present invention," as explained in the section "Nucleic acids of the present invention encoding phosphatidic acid phosphatase" described above.<br>
[0081]   In the present invention, proteins functionally equivalent to a protein consisting of the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 2 include a protein shown in (a) or (b) below:<br>

Among the above, the amino acid sequence with deletion, substitution or addition of one or more amino acids in SEQ ID NO: 2 or the amino acid sequence sharing an identity of 70% or more with an amino acid sequence consisting of SEQ ID NO: 2 is as explained in the section "Nucleic acids of the present invention encoding phosphatidic acid phosphatase" described above.   The phrase "protein which has the above activity of the present invention" is intended to also include mutants of a protein encoded by a nucleic acid comprising the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 4, or mutated proteins with various modifications such as substitution, deletion or addition of one or more amino acids in the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 2, as well as their modified proteins whose amino acid side chains or the like are modified, and their fusion proteins with other proteins, as long as these proteins have PAP activity and/or the ability to yield the fatty acid rate of PAP in the present invention.<br>
[0082]   The proteins of the present invention may also be artificially prepared by chemical synthesis techniques such as Fmoc method (fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl method) and tBoc method (t-butyloxycarbonyl method).   In addition, peptide synthesizers available from Advanced ChemTech, Pcrkin Elmer, Pharmacia, Protein Technology Instrument, Synthecell-Vega, PerSeptive, Shimadzu Corporation (Japan) or other manufacturers may be used for chemical synthesis. [0083]   Cloning of PAP nucleic acids<br>
The PAP nucleic acids of the present invention can be cloned, for example, by screening from a cDNA library using an appropriate probe.   They can also be cloned by PCR amplification with appropriate primers and the subsequent ligation to an appropriate vector.   The clones thus obtained may further be subcloned into another vector. [0084]   For example, it is possible to use commercially available plasmid vectors including pBlue-Scriptâ„¢ SK(+) (Stratagene), pGEM-T (Promega), pAmp (TM: Gibco-BRL), p-Direct (Clontech) and pCR2.1-T0P0 (Invitrogen).   In the case of using PCR amplification, primers may be any regions of the nucleotide sequence shown in, e.g., SEQ ID NO: 1.   By<br>
 <br>
way of example, it is possible to use the following primers from SEQ ID NO: 1:<br>
D-l: 5'-CATGGGTTGCTTCGCGCGCAAGACG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 5) as an upstream primer; and<br>
D-2: 5'-CGAAGCCGGCAAAGGCGGCAGTC-3' (SEQ ID NO: 6) as a downstream primer.   Then, PCR is performed on cDNA prepared from M. alpina cells with the above primers and DNA polymerase or the like.   Although this procedure can be readily accomplished by those skilled in the art according to, e.g., "Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual 3rd ed." (Cold Spring Harbor Press (2001)), PCR conditions in the present invention may be set as follows, by way of example:<br>
Denaturation temperature: 90-95Â°C<br>
Annealing temperature: 40-60Â°C<br>
Elongation temperature: 60-75Â°C<br>
Number of cycles: 10 or more cycles.<br>
The resulting PCR products may be purified in a known manner, for example, by using a kit (e.g., GENECLEAN (Funakoshi Co., Ltd., Japan), QIAquick PCR purification Kits (QIAGEN), ExoSAP-IT (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences)), a DEAE-cellulose filter or a dialysis tube.   In the case of using an agarose gel, the PCR products are subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis and nucleotide sequence fragments are excised from the agarose gel, followed by purification with GENECLEAN (Funakoshi Co., Ltd., Japan) or QIAquick Gel extraction Kits (QIAGEN) or by the freeze-squeeze method, etc. [0085]   The cloned nucleic acids can be determined for their nucleotide sequences with a nucleotide sequencer. [0086]   Vector construction for PAP expression and transformant preparatio^i<br>
The present invention also provides a recombinant vector comprising a nucleic acid encoding the PAP of the present invention.   The present invention further provides a transformant transformed with the above recombinant vector.<br>
[0087]   Such a recombinant vector and transformant can be obtained as follows.   Namely, a plasmid carrying a nucleic acid encoding the PAP of the present invention is digested with<br>
 <br>
restriction enzymes. Examples of restriction enzymes available for use include, but are not limited to, EcoRI, Kpnl, BamHI and Sail. This digestion may be followed by blunt ending with T4 polymerase. The digested nucleotide sequence fragment is purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. This nucleotide sequence fragment may be integrated into an expression vector in a known manner to obtain a vector for PAP expression. This expression vector is introduced into a host to prepare a transformant, which is then provided for expression of a desired protein.<br>
[0088]   In this case, the types of expression vector and host are not limited in any way as long as they allow expression of a desired protein.   Examples of a host include fungi, bacteria, plants, animals or cells thereof.   Fungi include filamentous fungi such as lipid-producing M alpina, and yeast strains such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae.   Bacteria include Escherichia colt (E. coli) and Bacillus subtilis.   Likewise, plants include oil plants such as rapeseed, soybean, cotton, safflower and flax.<br>
[0089]   As lipid-producing strains, those such as found in MYCOTAXON, Vol. XLIV, NO. 2, pp. 257-265 (1992) can be used.   Specific examples include microorganisms belonging to the genus Mortierella, as exemplified by microorganisms belonging to the subgenus Mortierella such as Mortierella elongata IFO8570, Mortierella exigua IF08571, Mortierella hygrophila IF05941, Mortierella alpina IF08568, ATCC16266, ATCC32221, ATCC42430, CBS 219.35, CBS224.37, CBS250.53, CBS343.66, CBS527.72, CBS528.72, CBS529.72, CBS608.70, CBS754.68, as well as microorganisms belonging to the subgenus Micromucor such as Mortierella isabellina CBS194.28, IF06336, IF07824, IF07873, IF07874, IF08286, IFO8308, IF07884, Mortierella nana IFO8190, Mortierella ramanniana IF05426, IF08186, CBS112.08, CBS212.72, IF07825, IF08184, IF08185, IF08287, Mortierella vinacea CBS236.82,   Particularly preferred is Mortierella alpina. [0090]   When a fungus is used as a host, it is desirable that the nucleic acid of the present invention is self-replicable in the host or has a structure insertable onto the fungal chromosome.   At the same time, it is preferable to further comprise a promoter and a terminator.    When M. alpina is used as a host, examples of an expression vector include<br>
 <br>
pD4, pDuraSC and pDuraS.   Any promoter may be used as long as it allows expression in<br>
the host, and examples include promoters derived from M. alpina, such as histonH4.1 gene<br>
promoter, GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) gene promoter and TEF<br>
(translation elongation factor) gene promoter.<br>
[0091]   Techniques for introducing a recombinant vector into filamentous fungi (e.g., M.<br>
alpina) include electroporation, spheroplast and particle delivery methods, as well as direct<br>
microinjection of DNA into nuclei.   In the case of using an auxotrophic host strain, strains<br>
growing on a selective medium lacking nutrients required for the host strain may be selected<br>
to thereby obtain transformed strains.   Alternatively, in a case where a drug resistance<br>
marker gene is used for transformation, culture may be carried out with a selective medium<br>
containing the drug to thereby obtain cell colonies resistant to the drug.<br>
[0092]   When yeast is used as a host, examples of an expression vector include pYE22m.<br>
Alternatively, commercially available yeast expression vectors such as pYES (Invitrogen)<br>
and pESC (STRATAGENE) may also be used.   Yeast hosts suitable for the present<br>
invention include, but are not limited to, Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain EH13-15 (trpl,<br>
MATa).   Examples of a promoter available for use include those derived from yeast or the<br>
like, such as GAPDH promoter, gall promoter and gallO promoter.<br>
[0093]   Techniques for introducing a recombinant vector into yeast cells include lithium<br>
acetate, electroporation and spheroplast methods, as well as dextran-mediated transfection,<br>
calcium phosphate precipitation, polybrene-mediated transfection, protoplast fusion,<br>
encapsulation of polynucleotide(s) in liposomes, and direct microinjection of DNA into<br>
nuclei.<br>
[0094]   When a bacterium such as E. coli is used as a host, examples of an expression vector<br>
include pGEX and pUC18 available from Pharmacia.   Examples of a promoter available for<br>
use include those derived from E. coli, phage or the like, such as trp promoter, lac promoter,<br>
PL promoter and PR promoter.   Techniques for introducing a recombinant vector into<br>
bacteria include electroporation and calcium chloride methods.<br>
[0095]   Method of the present invention for preparing a fatty acid composition<br>
 <br>
The present invention provides a method for preparing a fatty acid composition from the above transformant, i.e., a method for preparing a fatty acid composition from a cultured product obtained by culturing the above transformant, more specifically as described below. However, the method of the present invention is not limited to the following, and may be accomplished in any other manner generally known.<br>
[0096]   For culture of organisms transformed to express PAP, any medium may be used as long as it is a culture solution (medium) having appropriate pH and osmotic pressure as well as containing nutrients required for growth of each host, trace elements, and biomaterials such as serum or antibiotics.   For example, in the case of yeast cells transformed to express PAP, SC-Trp medium, YPD medium, YPD5 medium or the like may be used without being limited thereto.   Detailed medium composition is illustrated for SC-Trp medium: 6.7 g Yeast nitrogen base w/o amino acids (DIFCO), 20 g glucose and 1.3 g amino acid powder (a mixture of 1.25 g adenine sulfate, 0.6 g arginine, 3 g aspartic acid, 3 g glutamic acid, 0.6 g histidine, 1.8 g leucine, 0.9 g lysine, 0.6 g methionine, 1.5 g phenylalanine, 11.25 g serine, 0.9 g tyrosine, 4.5 g valine, 6 g threonine and 0.6 g uracil) per liter of medium. [0097]   Any culture conditions may be used as long as they are suitable for host growth and are adequate for maintenance of the generated enzyme in a stable state.   More specifically, individual conditions may be adjusted, including anaerobic degree, culture period, temperature, humidity, static culture or shaking culture.   Culture may be accomplished under the same conditions (one-step culture) or by so-called two-step or three-step culture using two or more different culture conditions.   For large-scale culture, two-step or more step culture is preferred because of its high culture efficiency.<br>
[0098]   To explain detailed procedures for the method of the present invention for preparing a fatty acid composition, two-step culture in which yeast is used as a host will be illustrated below as an example.   Namely, in the pre-culture step, the colonies obtained above are inoculated into any medium described above (e.g., SC-Trp medium) and cultured with shaking at 30Â°C for 2 days.   Then, in the main culture step, the pre-cultured solution (500 fxl) is added to 10 ml YPD5 (2% yeast extract, 1% polypeptone, 5% glucose) medium<br>
 <br>
and cultured with shaking at 30Â°C for 2 days.<br>
[0099]   Fatty acid compositions of the present invention<br>
The present invention also provides a fatty acid composition which is a collection of one or more fatty acids in cells expressing the PAP of the present invention.   Fatty acids may be free fatty acids or may be triglycerides, phospholipids or the like.   In particular, the fatty acid composition of the present invention is characterized by having a fatty acid rate ensuring a higher ratio of at least one or more of:<br>
i) the oleic acid content;<br>
ii) the ratio of the palmitoleic acid content to the palmitic acid content;<br>
iii) the ratio of the oleic acid content to the palmitic acid content;<br>
iv) the ratio of the total content of stearic acid and oleic acid to the palmitic acid content;<br>
v) the ratio of the Cig fatty acid content to the Cie fatty acid content; and<br>
vi) the ratio of the arachidonic acid, dihomo-v-linolenic acid and/or y-linolenic acid content<br>
when compared to a cultured product obtained by culturing a host which is not transformed with the recombinant vector of the present invention.   The phrase "host which is not transformed with the recombinant vector of the present invention" as used herein is intended to mean, for example, a host transformed with an empty vector carrying none of the nucleic acids described in the section "Nucleic acids of the present invention encoding phosphatidic acid phosphatase."<br>
[0100]   Fatty acids contained in the fatty acid composition of the present invention refer to linear or branched monocarboxylic acids of long-chain carbohydrates, including but not limited to, myristic acid (tetradecanoic acid) (14:0), myristoleic acid (tetradecenoic acid) (14:1), palmitic acid (hexadecanoic acid) (16:0), palmitoleic acid (9-hexadecenoic acid) (16:1), stearic acid (octadecanoic acid) (18:0), oleic acid (cis-9-octadecenoic acid) (18:1(9)), vaccenic acid (11-octadecenoic acid) (18:1(11)), linolic acid (cis,cis-9,12 octadecadienoic acid) (18:2(9,12)), a-linolenic acid (9,12,15-octadecatrienoic acid) (18:3(9,12,15)), y-<br>
 <br>

It should be noted that the above substance names are common names defined by the lUPAC Biochemical Nomenclature, and their systematic names are given in parentheses along with numerics denoting the number of carbons and the positions of double bonds.<br>
[0101]   The fatty acid composition of the present invention may be composed of any number and any type of fatty acids, as long as it is a combination of one or more fatty acids selected from those listed above.<br>
[0102]   Whether such a fatty acid composition of the present invention is obtained, i.e., whether the PAP of the present invention is expressed may be confirmed in a manner generally known, for example, as a change in fatty acid rate when PAP is expressed in yeast cells.    Namely, to lyophilizcd cells obtained by the above method of the present invention for preparing a fatty acid composition, chlorofonn:methanol adjusted to an appropriate ratio is added and stirred, followed by heat treatment for an appropriate period.   Centrifugation is further performed to separate the cells and collect the solvent.   This procedure is repeated several times.   Then, lipids are dried up in an appropriate manner, and a solvent such as chloroform is added to dissolve the lipids.   An appropriate aliquot of this sample is treated by the hydrochloric acid/methanol method to derive fatty acids in the cells into corresponding<br>
 <br>
methyl esters, followed by extraction with hexane.   After distilling off hexane, the fatty acids are analyzed by gas chromatography.<br>
[0103]   As a result, if a fatty acid composition having the above fatty acid rate is obtained, it can be determined that the fatty acid composition of the present invention was obtained. [0104]   Food or other products comprising: fatty acid compositions of the present invention The present invention also provides a food product comprising the above fatty acid composition.   The fatty acid composition of the present invention can be used in a routine manner for purposes such as production of food products containing fats and oils as well as production of industrial source materials (those for cosmetics, pharmaceuticals (e.g., external preparations for skin), soaps, etc.).   Cosmetics (cosmetic compositions) or pharmaceuticals (pharmaceutical compositions) may be formulated into any dosage form including, but not limited to, solutions, pastes, gels, solids or powders.   Likewise, possible forms of food products include pharmaceutical formulations such as capsules, as well as processed foods such as ordinary fluid diets, semi-digested nourishing diets, elemental diets, drinkable preparations or enteral nutrient preparations, which comprise the fatty acid composition of the present invention in admixture with proteins, sugars, fats, trace elements, vitamins, emulsifiers, flavorings, etc.<br>

[0108]   Method for strain evaluation or selection using PAP-encoding nucleic acid or PAP protein of the present invention<br>
The present invention also provides a method for evaluating or selecting a lipid-producing strain using the PAP-encoding nucleic acid or PAP protein of the present invention. Details are given below. [0109]   (1) Evaluation method<br>
One embodiment of the present invention is a method for evaluating a<br>
 <br>
lipid-producing strain using the PAP-encoding nucleic acid or PAP protein of the present invention.   As a first example for the above evaluation method of the present invention, lipid-producing test strains are evaluated for the above activity of the present invention by using primers or probes designed based on the nucleotide sequence of the present invention. General procedures for such evaluation are known and can be found in, e.g., International Patent Publication No. WOOl/040514 or JP 8-205900 A.   A brief explanation will be given below of this evaluation.<br>
[0110]   First, the genome of a test strain is prepared.   For genome preparation, it is possible to use any known technique such as Hereford method or potassium acetate method (see, e.g., Methods in Yeast Genetics, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, pl30 (1990)). [0111]   Primers or probes are designed based on the nucleotide sequence of the present invention, preferably SEQ ID NO: 4.   These primers or probes may be any regions of the nucleotide sequence of the present invention, and known procedures may be used for their design.   The number of nucleotides in a polynucleotide used as a primer is generally 10 nucleotides or more, preferably 15 to 25 nucleotides.   Likewise, the number of nucleotides appropriate for a region to be flanked by primers is generally 300 to 2000 nucleotides. [0112]   The primers or probes prepared above are used to examine whether the genome of the above test strain contains a sequence specific to the nucleotide sequence of the present invention.   A sequence specific to the nucleotide sequence of the present invention may be detected using known procedures.   For example, a polynucleotide comprising a part or all of a sequence specific to the nucleotide sequence of the present invention or a polynucleotide comprising a nucleotide sequence complementary to the above nucleotide sequence is used as one primer, and a polynucleotide comprising a part or all of a sequence located upstream or downstream of this sequence or a polynucleotide comprising a nucleotide sequence complementary to the above nucleotide sequence is used as the other primer to amplify nucleic acids from the test strain by PCR or other techniques, followed by determining the presence or absence of amplification products, the molecular weight of amplification products, etc.<br>
 <br>
[0113]   PCR conditions suitable for the method of the present invention are not limited in any way, and may be set as follows, by way of example:<br>
Denaturation temperature: 90-95Â°C<br>
Annealing temperature: 40-60Â°C<br>
Elongation temperature: 60-75Â°C<br>
Number of cycles: 10 or more cycles. The resulting reaction products may be separated by electrophoresis on an agarose gel or the like to determine the molecular weight of the amplification products.   Each amplification product is then confirmed as to whether its molecular weight is a size enough to cover a nucleic acid molecule corresponding to a region specific to the nucleotide sequence of the present invention, whereby the test strain can be predicted or evaluated for the above activity of the present invention.   Moreover, if the above amplification products are analyzed for their nucleotide sequences, as described above, the above activity of the present invention can be predicted or evaluated with more accuracy.   It should be noted that procedures for evaluating the above activity of the present invention are as described above. [0114]   As another example for the above evaluation method of the present invention, a test strain is cultured and measured for the expression level of PAP encoded by the nucleotide sequence of the present invention (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 4), whereby the test strain can be evaluated for the above activity of the present invention.   It should be noted that the expression level of PAP can be measured by culturing a test strain under appropriate conditions and quantifying mRNA or protein for PAP.   Quantification of mRNA or protein may be accomplished by using known procedures, for example, Northern hybridization or quantitative RT-PCR for mRNA quantification and Western blotting for protein quantification (Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley &amp; Sons 1994-2003). For evaluation of the above activity, it is also possible to measure the fatty acid rate of a fatty acid composition produced by the PAP of the present invention.   Procedures for measuring the fatty acid rate of a fatty acid composition are as described above. [0115]   (2) Selection method<br>
 <br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is a method for selecting a lipid-producing strain using the PAP-encoding nucleic acid or PAP protein of the present invention. As an example for the above selection method of the present invention, test strains are cultured and measured for the expression level of PAP encoded by the nucleotide sequence of the present invention (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 4) to select a strain with a desired expression level, whereby a strain having a desired activity can be selected.   Alternatively, a type strain is predetermined, and this type strain and test strains are each cultured and measured for the above expression level, followed by comparison of the expression level between the type strain and each test strain, whereby a desired strain can be selected.   More specifically, for example, a type strain and test strains are cultured under appropriate conditions and measured for their expression levels to select a test strain showing higher or lower expression than the type strain, whereby a strain having a desired activity can be selected.    Examples of a desired activity include the expression level of PAP and the fatty acid rate of a fatty acid composition produced by PAP, which may be measured as described above. [0116]   As another example for the above selection method of the present invention, test strains are cultured to select a strain in which the above activity of the present invention is high or low, whereby a strain having a desired activity can be selected.   Examples of a desired activity include the expression level of PAP and the fatty acid rate of a fatty acid composition produced by PAP, which may be measured as described above. [0117]   Examples of a test strain or type strain available for use include, but are not limited to, a strain transformed with the above vector of the present invention, a strain modified to suppress expression of the above nucleic acid of the present invention, a strain modified by mutagenesis, and a strain having natural mutation(s).   It should be noted that PAP activity in the present invention and the ability to yield the fatty acid rate of PAP in the present invention can be measured, for example, by the procedures described in the sections "Nucleic acids of the present invention encoding phosphatidic acid phosphatase" and "Fatty acid compositions of the present invention."   Mutagenesis may be accomplished by, but not limited to, physical techniques including ultraviolet or radioactive irradiation, or chemical<br>
 <br>
techniques including treatment with an agent such as EMS (ethylmethane sulfonate) or<br>
N-methyl-N-nitrosoguanidine (see, e.g., Yasuji Oshima ed., Biochemistry Experiments<br>
vol. 39, Experimental Protocols for Yeast Molecular Genetics, pp. 67-75, Japan Scientific<br>
Societies Press).<br>
[0118]   Strains used in the present invention as type and test strains include, but are not<br>
limited to, the above lipid-producing strains or yeast strains.   More specifically, the type<br>
strain or test strain may be a combination of any strains belonging to different genera or<br>
species, and one or more test strains may be used simultaneously.<br>
[0119]   The present invention will now be described in more detail by way of the following<br>
examples, which are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
[0120]   (1) EST analvsis<br>
M. alpina strain lS-4 was inoculated into 100 ml medium (1.8% glucose, 1% yeast extract, pH 6.0) and pre-cultured for 3 days at 28Â° C.   A10 L culture vessel (Able Co., Tokyo) was charged with 5 L medium (1.8% glucose, 1% soybean powder, 0.1% olive oil, 0.01% Adekanol, 0.3% BCH2PO4,0.1% Na2S04,0.05% CaCl2-2H20,0.05% MgCl2-6H20. pH 6.0) and inoculated with the entire pre-cultured product, followed by aerobic spiimer culture under conditions of 300 rpm, 1 vvm and 26Â°C for 8 days.   On days 1, 2 and 3 of culture, glucose was added in an amount corresponding to 2%, 2% and 1.5%, respectively. The cells were collected at each stage of culture (day 1, 2, 3, 6 or 8) to prepare total RNA by the guanidine hydrochloride/CsCl method.   Using an Oligotex-dT30<super>mRNA Purification Kit (Takara Bio Inc., Japan), poly(A)*RNA was purified from the total RNA. A cDNA library was prepared for each stage with a ZAP-cDNA Synthesis Kit (STRATAGENE), followed by one-pass sequence analysis from the 5'-end of cDNA (8000 clones x 5 stages).   The resulting sequences were clustered. [0121]   ^2^ Search for PAP eene homoloes<br>
The nucleotide sequences obtained from EST analysis were searched against amino acid sequences registered in GENBANK with a homology search program, BLASTX, to<br>
 <br>
extract homologs of the PAP gene.   As a result, among the ESTs, a sequence (SEQ ID NO:<br>
1) was found that had high homology with a Neurospora crawa-derived putative protein<br>
which is a homolog of diacylglycerol pyrophosphate phosphatase (DPP) which has PAP<br>
activity.   A contig obtained for this SEQ ID NO: 1 by EST analysis was composed of 9<br>
sequences from the library on day 8 in (1) above.<br>
Example 2<br>
[0122]   (V) Cloning of PAP homolog (MaPAPlI<br>
To obtain a cDNA fragment containing the full-length ORF of PAP homolog, the following primers were designed.<br>
Primer D-1 :CATGGGTTGCTTCGCGCGCAAGACG (SEQ ID NO: 5)<br>
Primer D-2 :CGAAGCCGGCAAAGGCGGCAGTC (SEQ ID NO: 6) Using these primers, PCR was performed with ExTaq (Takara Bio Inc., Japan) by using the cDNA library on day 8 as a template.    The resulting DNA fragment of 0.64 kbp was TA-cloned with a TOPO-TA cloning Kit (Invitrogen) to determine the nucleotide sequence of an insert.<br>
[0123]   The results confirmed that a DNA fragment comprising a nucleotide sequence covering nucleotides 113-744 of SEQ ID NO: 1 was cloned.   This plasmid was designated as pCR-2051-P.   Then, the plasmid pCR-2051-P was used as a template to perform PCR with the same primers as shown above.   In PCR, ExTaq (Takara Bio Inc., Japan) was used, but the attached dNTP mix was replaced by a PCR labeling mix (Roche Diagnostics) for digoxigenin (DIG) labeling of DNA to be amplified, thereby preparing a probe for use in cDNA library screening.   This probe was used to screen the cDNA library on day 8. [0124]   Hybridization conditions were set as follows.<br>
Buffer: 5 x SSC, 1% SDS, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50% formamide<br>
Temperature: 42Â°C (overnight)<br>
Washing: in 0.2 x SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65Â°C for 20 minutes (repeated three times) [0125]   Detection was accomplished by using a DIG nucleic acid detection kit (Roche Diagnostics).    From phage clones obtained by screening, the plasmid was excised by in vivo<br>
 <br>
excision to obtain plasmid DNA.<br>
[0126]   As a result of cDNA screening as described above, the nucleotide sequence of a clone with the longest insert was found to be identical with SEQ ID NO: 1.   This plasmid was designated as pB-PAPl.   SEQ ID NO: 1 contains a CDS of 1119 bp (SEQ ID NO: 3), thus suggesting that a sequence encoding the full length of PAP homolog was obtained (Figure 1).   This gene was designated as the MaPAPl gene.   The deduced amino acid sequence of a protein (MaPAPlp) encoded by this gene is shown in SEQ ID NO: 2. [0127]   (2^ Sequence analysis<br>
The nucleotide sequence of the MaPAPl gene and the deduced amino acid sequence encoded thereby were subjected to homology searches with BLAST and clustalW against known nucleic acid and amino acid sequences.   Among sequences hit in the homology search with BLASTX against amino acid sequences registered in GENBANK, a sequence having the lowest E-Value was a putative protein of Neurospora crassa-dmvtd DPPl homolog (Accession No. CAD70721).   The amino acid sequence identity was 59.3%, and the identity with a nucleic acid sequence encoding this protein was 57.4%.   Likewise, hits were also observed with fungal, plant and animal Mg^*-independent phosphatidic acid phosphatase 2 (PAP2) family proteins.   PAP2 family enzymes are membrane proteins and are enzymes of the six-transmembrane type.   Figure 2 shows an alignment of the amino acid sequences of these PAP2 family proteins with the deduced amino acid sequence encoded by the MaPAPl gene obtained in this study.   PAP2 family enzymes contain three consensus regions, and amino acids essential for their activity are also known.   As shown in Figure 2, MaPAPlp was found to also conserve these consensus regions (double-underlined in Figure 2) and the residues essential for activity, i.e., arginine in domain 1 and histidines in domains 2 and 3 (indicated with * in Figure 2). Example 3 [0128]   Construction of yeast expression vector<br>
To express MaPAPl in yeast cells, a yeast expression vector was constructed as follows.    First, pB-PAPl was used as a template to perform PCR with ExTaq (Takara Bio<br>
 <br>
Inc., Japan) using primer D-1 (SEQ ID NO: 5) and primer D-3:<br>
CCACTAAACTATGTTCTCAGGC (SEQ ID NO: 7).   The resulting DNA fragment of 1.1 kbp was TA-cloned with a TOPO-TA cloning Kit (Invitrogen) and confirmed for its nucleotide sequence.   A plasmid carrying the correct CDS nucleotide sequence (SEQ ID NO: 3) of MaPAPl was designated as pCR-PAPl.   The plasmid pCR-PAPl was partially digested with a restriction enzyme EcoRI.   A fragment of approximately 1.1 kbp was excised by agarose gel electrophoresis, purified with a GFX DNA purification Kit(GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences) and ligated to the EcoRI site of yeast expression vector pYE22m (Biosci. Biotech. Biochem., 59,1221-1228,1995).   The orientation of the inserted DNA fragment was confirmed, and a construct canying the insert in such an orientation as to cause ORF transcription from the GAPDH promoter of pYE22m was designated as pYE-MAPAPl. Example 4 [0129]   Yeast transformation<br>
The plasmid pYE22m or p YE-MAP API was used to transform yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain EH13-15 (trpl, MATa) (Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol., 30, 515-520,1989) by the lithium acetate method.   The transformed strains were screened by the ability to grow on SC-Trp agar medium (2% agar) containing, per liter, 6.7 g Yeast nitrogen base w/o amino acids (DIFCO), 20 g glucose and 1.3 g amino acid powder (a mixture of 1.25 g adenine sulfate, 0.6 g arginine, 3 g aspartic acid, 3 g glutamic acid, 0.6 g histidine, 1.8 g leucine, 0.9 g lysine, 0.6 g methionine, 1.5 g phenylalanine, 11.25 g serine, 0.9 g tyrosine, 4.5 g valine, 6 g threonine and 0.6 g uracil). Example 5 [0130]   Yeast culture<br>
Among the transformed strains obtained with each vector, any two strains (strains c-1 and c-2, or strains MaPAPl-1 and MaPAPl-2) were selected and cultured under the following conditions.<br>
[0131]   Namely, in the pre-culture step, a loopful of each yeast strain was inoculated from the plate into SC-Trp medium (10 ml) and cultured with shaking at 30'C for 2 days.   In the<br>
 <br>
main culture step, the pre-cultured solution (500 \xl) was added to 10 ml YPD5 (2% yeast extract, 1% polypeptone, 5% glucose) medium and cultured with shaking at 30Â°C for 2 days. Example 6 [0132]   Fatty acid analysis of veast strains<br>
The cultured yeast solutions were each centrifuged to collect the cells.   After washing with 10 ml sterilized water, the cells were collected again by centrifugation and lyophilized.    To the lyophilized cells, chloroform:methanol (2:1,4 ml) was added and stirred vigorously, followed by incubation at 70Â°C for 1 hour.   The cells were separated by centrifugation to collect the solvent.   To the remaining cells, chloroform:methanol (2:1, 4 ml) was added again, and the same procedure was repeated to collect the solvent.   After lipids were dried up with a SpeedVac, 2 ml chloroform was added to dissolve the lipids.   A 200 nl aliquot of this sample was treated by the hydrochloric acid/methanol method to derive fatty acids in the cells into corresponding methyl esters, followed by extraction with hexane. After distilling off hexane, the fatty acids were analyzed by gas chromatography. [0133]   The results obtained are shown in Table 2. [0134]   Table 2   Fatty acid rate of transformed strains (host: EH13-15) [0135]    [Table 2]<br>

(18:0+18:1)/(16:0+16:1)	0.93	1.02	1.49	1.52<br>
 <br>
The yeast strains transformed with MaP API (MaPAPl-1 and MaPAPl-2) and the control yeast strains (C-1 and C-2) were compared for their fatty acid rate.    In the MaPAPl-transformed yeast, the percentage of oleic acid increased by 20% or more when compared to the control strains.   The percentages of palmitic acid and palmitoleic acid both decreased when compared to the control strains, whereas the ratio of the palmitoleic acid content to the palmitic acid content increased slightly when compared to the control strains.   Moreover, in the MaP API-transformed yeast, the ratio of the oleic acid content to the palmitic acid content and the ratio of the total content of stearic acid and oleic acid to the palmitic acid content both increased when compared to the control strains.   Further, in the MaPAPl-transformed yeast, the ratio of Cig fatty acids to Ci6 fatty acids increased, indicating that fatty acids with longer chain lengths were produced.<br>
[0136]   Namely, these results indicated that expression of the MaPAPl gene allowed fatty acid rate alteration. Example 7<br>
[0137]   Expression analysis in arachidonic acid-producing yeast strains (1) Breeding of arachidonic acid-producing yeast strains<br>
To breed arachidonic acid-producing yeast {Saccharomyces cerevisiae) strains, the following plasmids were constructed.<br>
[0138]   First, cDNA prepared from M. alpina strain lS-4 was used as a template to perform PCR with ExTaq using a primer set of A12-f and A12-r, A6-f and A6-r, GLELO-f and GLELO-r, or A5-f and A5-r to thereby amplify the A12 fatty acid desaturase gene, the A6 fatty acid desaturase gene, the GLELO fatty acid elongase gene or the A5 fatty acid desaturase gene in the M. alpina strain lS-4.<br>
A12-f: TCTAGAATGGCACCTCCCAACACTATTG (SEQ ID NO: 8) A12-r: AAGCTTTTACTTCTTGAAAAAGACCACGTC (SEQ ID NO: 9) A6-f: TCTAGAATGGCTGCTGCTCCCAGTGTGAG (SEQ ID NO: 10) A6-r: AAGCTTTTACTGTGCCTTGCCCATCTTGG (SEQ ID NO: 11) GLELO-f: TCTAGAATGGAGTCGATTGCGCAATTCC (SEQ ID NO: 12)<br>
 <br>
GLELO-r: GAGCTCTTACTGCAACTTCCTTGCCTTCTC (SEQ ID NO: 13) A5-f: TCTAGAATGGGTGCGGACACAGGAAAAACC (SEQ ID NO: 14) AS-r: AAGCTTTTACTCTTCCTTGGGACGAAGACC (SEQ ID NO: 15) These genes were cloned with a TOPO-TA-cloning Kit.   The clones were confirmed for their nucleotide sequences, and those containing the nucleotide sequences of SEQ ID NOs: 16-19 were designated as plasmids pCR-MAA12DS (containing the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 16), pCR-MAA6DS (containing the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 17), pCR-MAGLELO (containing the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 18) and pCR- MAA5DS (containing the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 19), respectively. [0139]   On the other hand, a Hindlll-digested DNA fragment of approximately 1.2 kb obtained from plasmid pURA34 (JP 2001-120276 A) was inserted into the Hindlll site of vector pUC18 which had been digested with restriction enzymes EcoRI and SphI, followed by blunt ending and self-ligation.   A clone in which the EcoRI site of the vector was on the 5'-side of URA3 was designated as pUC-URA3.   Likewise, a Sail- and Xhol-digested DNA fragment of approximately 2.2 kb obtained from YEpl3 was inserted into the Sail site of vector pUC18, and a clone in which the EcoRI site of the vector was on the 5'-side of LUE2 was designated as pUC-LEU2.<br>
[0140]   Next, the plasmid pCR-MAA12DS was digested with a restriction enzyme Hindlll and, after blunt ending, was further digested with a restriction enzyme Xbal to obtain a DNA fragment of approximately 1.2 kbp, while vector pESC-URA (STRATAGENE) was digested with a restriction enzyme Sad and, after blunt ending, was further digested with a restriction enzyme Spel to obtain a DNA fragment of approximately 6.6 kbp.   These DNA fragments were ligated to obtain plasmid pESC-U-A12.   The plasmid pCR-MAA6DS was digested with a restriction enzyme Xbal and, after blunt ending, was further digested with a restriction enzyme Hindlll to obtain a DNA fragment of approximately 1.6 kbp, while the plasmid pESC-U-A12 was digested with a restriction enzyme Sail and, after blunt ending, was further digested with a restriction enzyme Hindlll to obtain a DNA fragment of approximately 8 kbp. These DNA fragments were ligated to obtain plasmid pESC-U-A12:A6.    This plasmid was<br>
 <br>
partially digested with a restriction enzyme PvuII, and the resulting fragment of approximately 4.2 kb was inserted into the Smal site of pUC-URA3 to obtain plasmid pUC-URA-A12-.A6.<br>
[0141]   Likewise, the plasmid pCR-MAGLELO was digested with restriction enzymes Xbal and Sad to obtain a DNA fragment of approximately 0.95 kbp, while vector pESC-LEU (STRATAGENE) was digested with restriction enzymes Xbal and Sad to obtain a DNA fragment of approximately 7.7 kbp.   These DNA fragments were ligated to obtain plasmid pESC-L-GLELO.   The plasmid pCR- MAA5DS was digested with a restriction enzyme Xbal and, after blunt ending, was further digested with a restriction enzyme Hindlll to obtain a DNA fragment of approximately 1.3 kbp, while the plasmid pESC-L-GLELO was digested with a restriction enzyme Apal and, after blunt ending, was further digested with a restriction enzyme Hindlll to obtain a DNA fragment of approximately 8.7 kbp.   These DNA fragments were ligated to obtain plasmid pESC-L-GLEL0:A5.   This plasmid was digested with a restriction enzyme PvuII, and the resulting fragment of approximately 3.2 kb was inserted into the Smal site of pUC-LEU2 to obtain plasmid pUC-LEU-GLEL0:A5. [0142]   S. cerevisiae strain YPH499 (STRATAGENE) was co-transformed with plasmid pUC-URA-A12:A6 and plasmid pUC-LEU-GLEL0:A5.   The transformed strains were screened by the ability to grow on SC-Leu,Ura agar medium (2% agar) contaming, per liter, 6.7 g Yeast nitrogen base w/o amino acids (DIFCO), 20 g glucose and 1.3 g amino acid powder (a mixture of 1.25 g adenine sulfate, 0.6 g arginine, 3 g aspartic acid, 3 g glutamic acid, 0.6 g histidine, 0.9 g lysine, 0.6 g methionine, 1.5 g phenylalanine, 11.25 g serine, 0.9 g tyrosine, 4.5 g valine, 6 g threonine and 1.2 g tryptophan).   Among the strains thus obtained, any one strain was designated as strain ARA3-1.<br>
[0143]   (2) Obtaining and analysis of transformed strains of arachidonic acid-producing yeast<br>
The strain ARA3-1 was transformed respectively with plasmids pYE22m and pYE-MAPAPl.   The transformed strains were screened by the ability to grow on SC-Trp,Leu,Ura agar medium (2% agar) containing, per liter, 6.7 g Yeast nitrogen base w/o amino acids<br>
 <br>
(DIFCO), 20 g glucose and 1.3 g amino acid powder (a mixture of 1.25 g adenine sulfate, 0.6 g arginine, 3 g aspartic acid, 3 g glutamic acid, 0.6 g histidine, 0.9 g lysine, 0.6 g methionine, 1.5 g phenylalanine, 11.25 g serine, 0.9 g tyrosine, 4,5 g valine and 6 g threonine).   Among the strains thus transformed, any 4 strains were selected for each plasmid.<br>
[0144]   These strains were each cultured at 30Â°C for 1 day in the above SC-Trp,Leu,Ura liquid medium (10 ml), 1 ml of which was then cultured at 15Â°C for 7 days in SG-Trp,Leu,Ura liquid medium (10 ml) containing, per liter, 6.7 g Yeast nitrogen base w/o amino acids (DIFCO), 20 g galactose and 1.3 g amino acid powder (a mixture of 1.25 g adenine sulfate, 0.6 g arginine, 3 g aspartic acid, 3 g glutamic acid, 0.6 g histidine, 0.9 g lysine, 0.6 g methionine, 1.5 g phenylalanine, 11.25 g serine, 0.9 g tyrosine, 4,5 g valine and 6 g threonine), followed by analysis of fatty acids in the cells.   Tables 3 and 4 show the fatty acid rate in the cells and the fat and oil content in the cells, respectively. [0145]    [Table 3]<br>

As shown above, in a case where the M. a/pma-derived PAPl gene was highly expressed in arachidonic acid-producing yeast cells, the intracellular fatty acid content was<br>

increased when compared to the control strains.   Likewise, the ratios of y-linolenic acid,<br>
DGLA and arachidonic acid to total fatty acid were also all increased.<br>
Example 8<br>
[0147]   Vector construction for M. alpina expression<br>
The vectors used for M. alpina expression were pDuraSC which allows expression of a desired gene from the GAPDH promoter, and pDuraMCS which allows expression of a desired gene from the histone promoter.<br>
[0148]   To express PAPl in M alpina cells, vectors were constructed as follows.   The plasmid pCR-PAPl was digested with a restriction enzyme PstI and then partially digested with a restriction enzyme Xhol.   Among the resulting DNA fragments, a fragment of approximately 1.1 kb was excised and inserted between the PstI and Xhol site in the multicloning site of vector pDuraSC or pDuraSMCS.   The resulting contracts were designated as plasmids pDuraSC-PAPl and pDura5MCS-PAPl, respectively. [0149]   Obtaining of transformed M alpina strains<br>
Uracil-auxotrophic strain Aura-3 derived from M. alpina as described in a patent document (WO2005/019437 entitled "Method of Breeding lipid-Producing Fungus") was used as a host and transformed with these plasmids by the particle delivery method.   For screening of the transformed strains, SC agar medium was used (0.5% Yeast Nitrogen Base w/o Amino Acids and Ammonium Sulfate (Difco), 0.17% ammonium sulfate, 2% glucose, 0.002% adenine, 0.003% tyrosine, 0.0001% methionine, 0.0002% arginine, 0.0002% histidine, 0.0004% lysine, 0.0004% tryptophan, 0.0005% threonine, 0.0006% isoleucine, 0.0006% leucine, 0.0006% phenylalanine, and 2% agar). [0150]   Evaluation of M alpina transformants<br>
The resulting transformed strains were each inoculated into 4 ml GY medium (2% glucose, 1% yeast extract) and cultured with shaking at 28Â°C for 3 or 4 days.   The cells were collected by filtration, and RNA was extracted with an RNeasy plant kit (QIAGEN). A Superscript First-Strand system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen) was used to synthesize cDNA. To confirm expression from the introduced construct and total expression for each gene.<br>

Based on the results of the above RT-PCR, transfonnants showing high level expression of each gene both in expression from the introduced construct and in total expression were selected: strains Gp-PAPl-49 and Hp-PAPl-2 from those transformed with plasmids pDuraSC-PAPl and pDura5MCS-PAPl, respectively. [0152]   These strains were each inoculated into GY medium (4 ml) and cultured with shaking at 28Â°C at 125 rpm.   On day 4 of culture, all cells were collected by filtration and lyophilized.   A portion (about 10-20 mg) of the dried cells was treated by the hydrochloric acid/raethanol method to derive fatty acids in the cells into corresponding methyl esters, followed by extraction with hexane.   After distilling off hexane, the fatty acids were analyzed by gas chromatography.
