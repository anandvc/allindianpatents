DISPERSIBLE KND   FAST-HYDRATING BIOPOLYMER<br>
The present- invention relates to dispersible and fast-hydrating biopolymers in dry form and to their use as thickeners, emulsifiers and/or stabilizers for the preparation of industrial formulations (such as, for example, the construction, paints, paper, textiles, plant-protection, water-treatment and petroleum industries), food, cosmetic, agrochemical and pharmaceutical formulations,<br>
Biopolymers of high molecular weight, which are polysaccharides in the context of the present invention, are increasingly used in many industrial applications for their thickening, viscosity-modifying, emulsifying and/or stabilizing properties in media, especially aqueous media. Thus, xanthan gum, on account of its exceptional rheological properties, is used in fields as varied as construction, paints, paper, textiles, cosmetics, food, agriculture, water treatment and oil drilling and recovery.<br>
For many applications, when the biopolymer is in dry form, it is necessary to place it in aqueous solution. However, the major drawback of these powders is their difficulty in dispersing and hydrating quickly in a given aqueous medium. Often, the dispersion and/or hydration of these biopolymers results in the formation<br><br>
of lumps, which are harmful to the functionality of the medium.<br>
In the case of a thickening biopolymer such as xanthan, the improvement in terms of dispersion and hydration without the formation of lumps allows in particular better control of the viscosity of the reaction medium.<br>
For this reason, it would be advantageous to develop a biopolymer, in dry form, in particular of xanthan gum type, which can be easily dispersed and quickly hydrated in aqueous media while at the same time reducing or even eliminating the fozrmation of lumps.<br>
In practice, one of the solutions recommended to avoid the formation of lumps while at the same time maintaining good dispersibility and hydratability of the powders consists in modifying the polymer powder by the so-called "granulation" method. This method consists in aggregating the biopolymer powder in slightly humid medium ("fluid bed" technique) in order to obtain granules with an average size of between 300 and 1000 microns. The major drawback of this method lies in its high implementation cost.<br>
Toother solution consists in supplementing the biopolymer with a compound of surfactant type. However, the addition of such compounds does not<br><br>
correspond with the current trend which is to reduce the number of additives added to a given formulation, in particular in the food sector.<br>
The aim of the present invention is to propose a biopolymer powder which, in aqueous media, without the need to add an additive and/or vigorous stirring means, gives an improved dispersion and fast hydration while at the same time reducing or even eliminating the formation of lumps.<br>
To this end, a subject of the invention is a dispersible and fast-hydrating biopolymer, in dry form, at least 75% by weight of the particles of which have a diameter of between 60 and 250 microns and a mean diameter (dso) of between 100 and 250 microns.<br>
Preferably, at least 75% by weight of the biopolymer particles have a diameter of between 100 and 200 microns and a mean diameter (dgo) of between 100 and 200 microns.<br>
The judicious selection of the particle size distribution of the biopolymers according to the invention makes it possible both to control the dispersion of the powder and to promote its hydration while at the same time substantially reducing and usually entirely eliminating the formation of lumps.<br>
The biopolymers of the invention also have the advantage of being dust-free and easy to pour.<br><br>
other advantag-^s and characteristics of the present invention wil I   emerge more clearly on reading the description, the -examples and the figures which follow.<br>
In the -prer.i-r^*-   description, the notation dso represents the particle r;ize distribution such that 50' by volume of the partLcI-'-S are less th'ah or equal to the said size. For ex'^rrp^e,   a dso of 100 microns means that 5 0% by volume of '■'.':  particles are less than or equal to 100 microns .--"- -i^e.<br>
The partici': .';:2e is determined by laser spectroscopy with a n.-^c'.ine such as a "Coulter LS 23 0" machine in dry-route '.-or. .* igyration .<br>
In the contf--x' of the present invention, the term "biopolymer" mor'-- &gt;^..rticularly denotes polysaccharides of hi';-' .-nolecular weight, usually greater than 1 x 10^ :;/'"-! (measured by gel permeation) and which consists of gl-^cose, mannose, galactose, rhamnose, glucuronic ^.cid, mannuronic acid and guluronic acid units, -..'-ionally with acetate and pyruvate derivatives. Tr.eir particular structure and their properties are ';._3closed, for example, in the book Industrial Gums   -.'r-istler - 2nd edition -chapters XXI-XXIII (i:-"^ -<br><br>
These biopolymers are advantageously produced by aerobic culturing of microorganisms in an aqueous nutrient medium.<br>
Many microorganisms such as bacteria, yeasts, fungi and algae are capable of producing these biopolymers. Mention may be made, inter alia, of:<br>
•	bacteria belonging to the genus Xanthomonas  and more particularly to the species described in Bergey's Manual of Determinative Bacteriology (8th edition -1974 - Williams N. Wilkins Co. Baltimore) such as Xanthomonas begoniae,   Xanthomonas  campestris, Xanthomonas  caxotae,   Xanthomonas hederae,   Xanthomonas incanae,   Xanthomonas malvacearum,   Xanthomonas papayericola,   Xanthomonas phaseoli,   Xanthomonas pisi, Xanthomonas  vasculorum,   Xanthomonas  vesicatoria, Xanthomonas  vitians  and Xanthomonas pelargonii;<br>
•	bacteria belonging to the genus Arthrobacter  and more particularly the species ArthroJbacter stabilis  and ArthroJbacter viscosus;<br>
•	bacteria belonging to the genus Erwinina;<br>
•	bacteria belonging to the genus AzotOjbacter and more particularly the species Azotobacter indicus;<br>
•	bacteria belonging to the genus Agrojbacteriuin and more particularly the species Agrobacterium radiobacter,   Agrobacterium rhizogenes  and Agrobacterium tumefaciens;<br><br>
•	bacteria belonging to the genus Alcalxgenes  and more particularly Alcaligenes  faecalis;<br>
•	bacteria belonging to the genus Pseudomonas  and more particularly Pseudomonas methanica;<br>
•	bacteria belonging to the genus CoryneJbacteriujn;<br>
•	bacteria belonging to the genus Bacillus  and more particularly Bacillus polymyxa;<br>
•	fungi belonging to the genus 5cIerotiuin and more particularly to the species Sclerotium glucanicum, Sclerotium rolfsil   or Plectania  occidentalis;<br>
•	fungi belonging to the genus Aspergillus  and more particularly to the species Aspergillus  itaconicus  and Aspergillus   terreus;<br>
•	yeasts belonging to the genus Hansenula,   such as the species Hansenula  capsulata,<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the microorganism is a bacterium of the genus Xanthomonas,   more particularly the species Xanthomonas campestris,   and the biopolymer is xanthan gum.<br>
The biopolymers according to the invention may be obtained by any process for controlling the particle size distribution of a powder. By way of example, mention may be made of screening,<br>
As indicated above, the biopolymers according to the present invention disperse easily in aqueous media and do not require high-shear means. The<br><br>
dispersibility of the biopolymer powder is evaluated by counting the lumps formed when the biopolymer is placed in aqueous solution. The greater the number of lumps formed, the poorer the dispersibility-<br>
The hydration speed may be determined, for example, by measuring the viscosity developed over time under gentle stirring conditions. As a guide, gentle stirring may correspond to stirring with a deflocculating paddle at a speed which may be between 400 and 600 rpm.<br>
These characteristics make it possible to incorporate the biopolymers according to the invention into many formulations, as thickeners, viscosity modifiers, emulsifiers and/or stabilizers.<br>
The invention also covers the use of a biopolymer as defined above as a thickener, viscosity modifier, emulsifier and/or stabilizer in:<br>
formulations for the drilling for and assisted<br>
recovery of petroleum and for water treatment;<br>
formulations for paper, construction and textiles;<br>
food, cosmetics, agrochemical and pharmaceutical<br>
formulations;<br>
formulations for industrial and household cleaning; as well as the said formulations containing such a biopolymer.<br><br>
