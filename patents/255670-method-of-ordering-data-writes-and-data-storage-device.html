				<td>VIRTUAL ORDERED WRITES FOR MULTIPLE STORAGE DEVICES<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
1.	Technical Field<br>
This application relates to computer storage devices, and more particularly to the<br>
field of transferring data between storage devices.<br>
2.	Description of Related Art<br>
Host processor systems may store and retrieve data using a storage device containing<br>
a plurality of host interface units (host adapters), disk drives, and disk interface units (disk<br>
adapters). Such storage devices are provided, for example, by EMC Corporation of<br>
Hopkinton, Mass. and disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,206,939 to Yanai et al., U.S. Patent<br>
No. 5,778,394 to Galtzur et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,845,147 to Vishlitzky et al., and U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,857,208 to Ofek. The host systems access the storage device through a<br>
plurality of channels provided therewith. Host systems provide data and access control<br>
information through the channels to the storage device and the storage device provides data<br>
to the host systems also through the channels. The host systems do not address the disk<br>
drives of the storage device directly, but rather, access what appears to the host systems as a<br>
plurality of logical disk units. The logical disk units may or may not correspond to the<br>
actual disk drives. Allowing multiple host systems to access the single storage device unit<br>
allows the host systems to share data stored therein.<br>
In some instances, it may be desirable to copy data from one storage device to<br>
another. For example, if a host writes data to a first storage device, it may be desirable to<br>
copy that data to a second storage device provided in a different location so that if a disaster<br>
occurs that renders the first storage device inoperable, the host (or another host) may resume<br>
operation using the data of the second storage device. Such a capability is provided, for<br>
example, by the Remote Data Facility (RDF) product provided by EMC (RTM) Corporation<br>
of Hopkinton, Massachusetts. With RDF, a first storage device, denoted<br><br>
the "primary storage device" (or "R1") is coupled to the host One or more other<br>
storage devices, called "secondary storage devices" (or "R2") receive copies of the data<br>
that is written to the primary storage device by the host The host interacts directly with<br>
the primary storage device, but any data changes made to the primary storage device<br>
are automatically provided to the one or more secondary storage devices using RDF.<br>
The primary and secondary storage devices may be connected by a data link, such as an<br>
ESCON link, a Fibre Channel link, and/or a Gigabit Ethernet link. The RDF<br>
functionality may be facilitated with an RDF adapter (RA) provided at each of the<br>
storage devices.<br>
RDF allows synchronous data transfer where, after data written from a host to a<br>
primary storage device is transferred from the primary storage device to a secondary<br>
storage device using RDF, receipt is acknowledged by the secondary storage device to<br>
the primary storage device which then provides a write acknowledge back to the host<br>
Thus, in synchronous mode, the host does not receive a write acknowledge from the<br>
primary storage device until the RDF transfer to the secondary storage device has been<br>
completed and acknowledged by the secondary storage device.<br>
A drawback to the synchronous RDF system is that the latency of each of the<br>
write operations is increased by waiting for the acknowledgement of the RDF transfer.<br>
This problem is worse when there is a long distance between the primary storage device<br>
and the secondary storage device; because of transmission delays, the time delay<br>
required for-making the RDF transfer and then waiting for an acknowledgement back<br>
after the transfer is complete may be unacceptable.<br>
It is also possible to use RDF in an a semi-synchronous mode, in which case the<br>
data is written from the host to the primary storage device which acknowledges the<br>
write immediately and men, at the same time, begins the process of transferring the data<br>
to the secondary storage device. Thus, for a single transfer of data, this scheme<br>
overcomes some of the disadvantages of using RDF in the synchronous mode.<br><br>
However for data integrity purposes, the semi-synchronous transfer mode does not allow the<br>
primary storage device to transfer data to the secondary storage device until a previous<br>
transfer is acknowledged by the secondary storage device. Thus, the bottlenecks associated<br>
with using RDF in the synchronous mode are simply delayed by one iteration because<br>
transfer of a second amount of data cannot occur until transfer of previous data has been<br>
acknowledged by the secondary storage device.<br>
Another possibility is to have the host write data to the primary storage device in<br>
asynchronous mode and have the primary storage device copy data to the secondary storage<br>
device in the background. The background copy involves cycling through each of the tracks<br>
of the primary storage device sequentially and, when it is determined that a particular block<br>
has been modified since the last time that block was copied, the block is transferred from the<br>
primary storage device to the secondary storage device. Although this mechanism may<br>
attenuate the latency problem associated with synchronous and semi-synchronous data<br>
transfer modes, a difficulty still exists because there cannot be a guarantee of data<br>
consistency between the primary and secondary storage devices. If there are problems, such<br>
as a failure of the primary system, the secondary system may end up with out-of-order<br>
changes that make the data unusable.<br>
A proposed solution to this problem is the Symmetrix Automated Replication (SAR)<br>
process, which is described in pending U.S. patent applications publications US2004-<br>
0039959 and US2004-0039888, both of which were filed on August 21,2002. The SAR<br>
uses devices (BCV's) that can mirror standard logical devices. A BCV device can also be<br>
split from its standard logical device after being mirrored and can be resynced (i.e., re-<br>
established as a mirror) to the standard logical devices after being split. In addition, a BCV<br>
can be remotely mirrored using RDF, in which case the BCV may propagate data changes<br>
made thereto (while the BCV is acting as a mirror) to the BCV remote mirror when the<br>
BCV is split from the corresponding standard logical device.<br><br>
However, using the SAR process requires the significant overhead of<br>
continuously splitting and resyncing the BCV's. The SAR process also uses host<br>
control and management, which relies on the controlling host being operational. In<br>
addition, the cycle time for a practical implementation of a SAR process is on the order<br>
of twenty to thirty minutes, and thus the amount of data that may be lost when an RDF<br>
link and/or primary device fails could be twenty to thirty minutes worth of data.<br>
Thus, it would be desirable to have an RDF system that exhibits some of the<br>
beneficial qualities of each of the different techniques discussed above while reducing<br>
the drawbacks. Such a system would exhibit low latency for each host write regardless<br>
of the distance between the primary device and the secondary device and would<br>
provide consistency (recoverability) of the secondary device in case of failure.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
According to the present invention, ordering data writes includes at least some<br>
of a group of primary storage devices receiving a first plurality of data writes, causing a<br>
i<br>
cycle switch for the group of primary storage devices where the first plurality of data<br>
writes are associated with a particular cycle on each primary storage device in the<br>
group, and at least some of the group of primary storage devices receiving a second<br>
plurality of writes after initiating the cycle switch where all of the second plurality of<br>
writes are associated with a cycle different from the particular cycle on each primary<br>
storage device. Writes to the group begun after initiating the cycle switch may not<br>
complete until after the cycle switch has completed. Ordering data writes may also<br>
include, after completion of the cycle switch, each of the primary storage devices of the<br>
group initiating transfer of the first plurality of writes to a corresponding secondary<br>
storage device. Ordering data writes may also include, following each of the primary<br>
storage devices of the group completing transfer of the first plurality of writes to a<br>
corresponding secondary storage device, each of the primary storage devices sending a<br>
message to the corresponding secondary storage device. Ordering data writes may also<br>
include providing the first plurality of data writes to cache slots of the group of primary<br>
storage device. Receiving a first plurality of data writes may also include receiving a<br><br>
plurality of data writes from a host. A host may cause the cycle switch. Ordering data<br>
writes may also include waiting a predetermined amount of time, determining if all of<br>
the primary storage devices of the group of storage devices is ready to switch, and, for<br>
each of the primary storage devices of the group, sending a first command thereto to<br>
cause a cycle switch. Sending a command to cause a cycle switch may also cause<br>
writes begun after the first command to not complete until a second command is<br>
received. Ordering data writes may also include, after sending the first command to all<br>
of the primary storage devices of the group, sending the second command to all of the<br>
primary storage devices to allow writes to complete.<br>
According further to the present invention, computer software that orders data<br>
writes to a group of primary storage devices includes executable code that causes a<br>
cycle switch for the group of primary storage devices where the first plurality of data<br>
writes are associated with a particular cycle on each primary storage device in the<br>
group and executable code that, for a second plurality of writes provided after<br>
initiating the cycle switch, associates all of the second plurality of writes with a cycle<br>
different from the particular cycle on each primary storage device. Writes to the group<br>
begun after initiating the cycle switch may not complete until after the cycle switch has<br>
completed. The computer software may also include executable code that causes each<br>
of the primary storage devices of the group to initiate transfer of the first plurality of<br>
writes to a corresponding secondary storage device after completion of the cycle<br>
switch. The computer software may also include executable code mat causes each of<br>
the primary storage devices to send a message to the corresponding secondary storage<br>
device following each of the primary storage devices of the group completing transfer<br>
of the first plurality of writes to a corresponding secondary storage device. The<br>
computer software may also include executable code that provides the first plurality of<br>
data writes to cache slots of the group of primary storage device. The first plurality of<br>
data writes may be from a host A host may run executable code mat causes the cycle<br>
switch. Executable code that causes the cycle switch may include executable code that<br>
waits a predetermined amount of time, executable code that determines if all of the<br>
primary storage devices of the group of storage devices is ready to switch, and<br><br>
executable code that sends a first command to each of the primary storage devices of<br>
the group to cause a cycle switch. Executable code that sends a command to cause a<br>
cycle switch may also cause writes begun after the first command to not complete until<br>
a second command is received. The computer software may also include executable<br>
code that sends the second command to all of the primary storage devices to allow<br>
writes to complete after sending the first command to all of the primary storage devices<br>
of the group.<br>

Detailed Description of Various Embodiments<br>
Referring to Figure 1, a diagram 20 shows a relationship between a host 22, a<br>
local storage device 24 and a remote storage device 26. The host 22 reads and writes<br>
data from and to the local storage device 24 via a host adapter (HA) 28, which<br>
facilitates the interface between the host 22 and the local storage device 24. Although<br>
the diagram 20 only shows one host 22 and one HA 28, it will be appreciated by one of<br>
ordinary skill in the art mat multiple HA's may be used and that one or more HA's may<br>
have one or more hosts coupled thereto.<br>
Data from the local storage device 24 is copied to the remote storage device 26<br>
via an RDF link 29 to cause the data on the remote storage device 26 to be identical to<br>
the data on the local storage device 24. Although only the one link 29 is shown, it is<br>
possible to have additional links between the storage devices 24,26 and to have links<br>
between one or both of the storage devices 24,26 and other storage devices (not<br>
shown). Note thatthere may be a time delay between the transfer of data from the local<br>
storage device 24 to the remote storage device 26, so that the remote storage device 26<br>
may, at certain points in time, contain data that is not identical to the data on the local<br>
storage device 24. Communication using RDF is described, for example, in U.S. Patent<br>
No. 5,742,792, which is incorporated by reference herein.<br>
The local storage device 24 includes a first plurality of RDF adapter units<br>
(RA's) 30a, 30b, 30c and the remote storage device 26 includes a second plurality of<br>
RA's 32a-32c. The RA's 30a-30c, 32a-32c are coupled to the RDF link 29 and are<br>
similar to the host adapter 28, but are used to transfer data between the storage devices<br>
24,26. The software used in connection with the RA's 30a-30c, 32a-32c is discussed<br>
in more detail hereinafter.<br><br>
The storage devices 24,26 may include one or more disks, each containing a<br>
different portion of data stored on each of the storage devices 24,26. Figure 1 shows<br>
the storage device 24 including a plurality of disks 33a, 33b, 33c and the storage device<br>
26 including a plurality of disks 34a, 34b, 34c. The RDF functionality described herein<br>
may be applied so mat the data for at least a portion of the disks 33a-33c of the local<br>
storage device 24 is copied, using RDF, to at least a portion of the disks 34a-34c of the<br>
remote storage device 26. It is possible mat other data of the storage devices 24,26 is<br>
not copied between the storage devices 24,26, and thus is not identical.<br>
Each of the disks 33a-33c is coupled to a corresponding disk adapter unit (DA)<br>
35a, 35b, 35c that provides data to a corresponding one of the disks 33a-33c and<br>
receives data from a corresponding one of the disks 33a-33c. Similarly, a plurality of<br>
DA's 36a, 36b, 36c of the remote storage device 26 are used to provide data to<br>
corresponding ones of the disks 34a-34c and receive data from conesponding ones of<br>
the disks 34a-34c. An internal data path exists between the DA's 35a-35c, the HA 28<br>
and the RA's 30a-30c of the local storage device 24. Similarly, an internal data path<br>
exists between the DA's 36a-36c and the RA's 32a-32c of the remote storage device 26.<br>
Note that, in other embodiments, it is possible for more man one disk to be serviced by<br>
a DA and that it is possible for more than one DA to service a disk.<br>
The local storage device 24 also includes a global memory 37 that may be used<br>
to facilitate data transferred between the DA's 35a-35c, the HA 28 and the RA's 30a-<br>
30c. The memory 37 may contain tasks that are to be performed by one or more of the<br>
DA's 35a-35c, the HA 28 and the RA's 30a-30c, and a cache for data fetched from one<br>
or more of the disks 33a-33c. Similarly, the remote storage device 26 includes a global<br>
memory 38 mat may contain tasks that are to be performed by one or more of the DA's<br>
36a-36c and the RA's 32a-32c, and a cache for data fetched from one or more of the<br>
disks 34a-34c Use of the memories 37,38 is described in more detail hereinafter.<br><br>
The storage space in the local storage device 24 that corresponds to the disks<br>
33a-33c may be subdivided into a plurality of volumes or logical devices. The logical<br>
devices may or may not correspond to the physical storage space of the disks 33a-33c.<br>
Thus, for example, the disk 33a may contain a plurality of logical devices or,<br>
alternatively, a single logical device could span both of the disks 33a, 33b. Similarly,<br>
the storage space for the remote storage device 26 that comprises the disks 34a-34c<br>
may be subdivided into a plurality of volumes or logical devices, where each of the<br>
logical devices may or may not correspond to one or more of the disks 34a-34c.<br>
Providing an RDF mapping between portions of the local storage device 24 and<br>
the remote storage device 26 involves setting up a logical device on the remote storage<br>
device 26 that is a remote mirror for a logical device on the local storage device 24.'<br>
The host 22 reads and writes data from and to the logical device on the local storage<br>
device 24 and the RDF mapping causes modified data to be transferred from the local<br>
storage device 24 to the remote storage device 26 using the RA's, 30a-30c, 32a-32c and<br>
the RDF link 29. In steady state operation, the logical device on the remote storage<br>
device 26 contains data that is identical to the data of the logical device on the local<br>
storage device 24. The logical device on the local storage device 24 that is accessed by<br>
the host 22 is referred to as the "R1 volume" (or just "R1") while the logical device on<br>
the remote storage device 26 that contains a copy of the data on the Rl volume is called<br>
the "R2 volume" (or just "R2"). Thus, the host reads and writes data from and to the<br>
Rl volume and RDF handles automatic copying and updating of the data from the Rl<br>
volume to the R2 volume.<br>
Referring to Figure 2, a path of data is illustrated from the host 22 to the local<br>
storage device 24 and the remote storage device 26. Data written from the host 22 to<br>
the local storage device 24 is stored locally, as illustrated by the data element 51 of the<br>
local storage device 24. The data that is written by the host 22 to the local storage<br>
device 24 is also maintained by the local storage device 24 in connection with being<br>
sent by the local storage device 24 to the remote storage device 26 via the link 29.<br><br>
In the system described herein, each data write by the host 22 (of, for example a<br>
record, a plurality of records, a track, etc.) is assigned a sequence number. The<br>
sequence number may be provided in an appropriate data field associated with the<br>
write. In Figure 2, the writes by the host 22 are shown as being assigned sequence<br>
number N. All of the writes performed by the host 22 that are assigned sequence<br>
number N are collected in a single chunk of data 52. The chunk 52 represents a<br>
plurality of separate writes by the host 22 that occur at approximately the same time.<br>
Generally, the local storage device 24 accumulates chunks of one sequence<br>
number while transmitting a previously accumulated chunk (having the previous<br>
sequence number) to the remote storage device 26. Thus, while the local storage device<br>
24 is accumulating writes from the host 22 mat are assigned sequence number NT, the<br>
writes that occurred for the previous sequence number (N-1) are transmitted by the<br>
local storage device 24 to the remote storage device 26 via the link 29. A chunk 54<br>
represents writes from the host 22 that were assigned the sequence number N-1 that<br>
have not been transmitted yet to the remote storage device 26.<br>
The remote storage device 26 receives the data from the chunk 54<br>
corresponding to writes assigned a sequence number N-1 and constructs a new clunk<br>
56 of host writes having sequence number N-1. The data may be transmitted using<br>
appropriate RDF protocol that acknowledges data sent across the link 29. When the<br>
remote storage device 26 has received all of the data from the chunk 54, the local<br>
storage device 24 sends a commit message to the remote storage device 26 to commit<br>
all the data assigned the N-1 sequence number corresponding to the chunk 56.<br>
Generally, once a chunk corresponding to a particular sequence number is committed,<br>
that chunk may be written to the logical storage device. This is illustrated in Figure 2<br>
with a chunk 58 corresponding to writes assigned sequence number N-2 (i.e., two<br>
before the current sequence number being used in connection with writes by the host 22<br>
to the local storage device 26). In Figure 2, the chunk 58 is shown as being written to a<br>
data element 62 representing disk storage for the remote storage device 26. Thus, the<br>
remote storage device 26 is receiving and accumulating the chunk 56 corresponding to<br><br>
sequence number N-1 while the chunk 58 corresponding to the previous sequence<br>
number (N-2) is being written to disk storage of the remote storage device 26<br>
illustrated by the data element 62. In some embodiments, the data for the chunk 58 is<br>
marked for write (but not necessarily written immediately), while the data for the chunk<br>
56 is not<br>
Thus, in operation, the host 22 writes data to the local storage device 24 that is<br>
stored locally in the data element 51 and is accumulated in the chunk 52. Once all of<br>
the data for a particular sequence number has been accumulated (described elsewhere<br>
herein), the local storage device 24 increments the sequence number. Data from the<br>
chunk 54 corresponding to one less than the current sequence number is transferred<br>
from the local storage device 24 to the remote storage device 26 via the link 29. The<br>
chunk 58 corresponds to data for a sequence number mat was committed by the local<br>
storage device 24 sending a message to the remote storage device 26. Data from the<br>
chunk 58 is written to disk storage of the remote storage device 26.<br>
Note that the writes within a particular one of the chunks 52,54,56, 58 are not<br>
necessarily ordered. However, as described in more detail elsewhere herein, every<br>
write for the chunk 58 corresponding to sequence number N-2 was begun prior to<br>
beginning any of the writes for the chunks 54,56 corresponding to sequence number N-<br>
1. hi addition, every write for the chunks 54,56 corresponding to sequence number N-<br>
1 was begun prior to beginning any of the writes for the chunk 52 corresponding to<br>
sequence number N. Thus, in the event of a communication failure between the local<br>
storage device 24 and the remote storage device 26, the remote storage device 26 may<br>
simply finish writing the last committed chunk of data (the chunk 58 in the example of<br>
Figure 2) and can be assured that the state of the data at the remote storage device 26 is<br>
ordered in the sense that the data element 62 contains all of the writes that were begun<br>
prior to a certain point in time and contains no writes that were begun after that point in<br>
time. Thus, R2 always contains a point in time copy of R1 and it is possible to<br>
reestablish a consistent image from the R2 device.<br><br>
Referring to Figure 3, a diagram 70 illustrates items used to construct and<br>
maintain the chunks 52,54. A standard logical device 72 contains data written by the<br>
host 22 and corresponds to the data element 51 of Figure 2 and the disks 33a-33c of<br>
Figure 1. The standard logical device 72 contains data written by the host 22 to the<br>
local storage device 24.<br>
Two linked lists of pointers 74,76 are used in connection with the standard<br>
logical device 72. The linked lists 74,76 correspond to data that may be stored, for<br>
example, in the memory 37 of the local storage device 24. The linked list 74 contains a<br>
plurality of pointers 81-85, each of which points to a slot of a cache 88 used in<br>
connection with the local storage device 24. Similarly, the linked list 76 contains a<br>
plurality of pointers 91-95, each of which points to a slot of the cache 88. In some<br>
embodiments, the cache 88 may be provided in the memory 37 of the local storage<br>
device 24. The cache 88 contains a plurality of cache slots 102-104 that may be used<br>
in connection to writes to the standard logical device 72 and, at the same time, used in<br>
connection with the linked lists 74,76.<br>
Each of the linked lists 74,76 may be used for one of the chunks of data 52,54<br>
so that, for example, the linked list 74 may correspond to the chunk of data 52 for<br>
sequence number N while the linked list 76 may correspond to the chunk of data 54 for<br>
sequence number N-1. Thus, when data is written by the host 22 to the local storage<br>
device 24, the data is provided to the cache 88 and, in some cases (described elsewhere<br>
herein), an appropriate pointer of the linked list 74 is created. Note that the data will<br>
not be removed ftom the cache 88 until the data is destaged to the standard logical<br>
device 72 and toe data is also no longer pointed to by one of the pointers 81-85 of the<br>
linked list 74, as described elsewhere herein.<br>
In an embodiment herein, one of the linked lists 74,76 is deemed "active" while<br>
the other is deemed "inactive". Thus, for example, when the sequence number N is<br>
even, the linked list 74 may be active while the linked list 76 is inactive. The active<br><br>
one of the linked lists 74, 76 handles writes from the host 22 while the inactive one of the<br>
linked lists 74, 76 corresponds to the data that is being transmitted from the local storage<br>
dcice 24 to the remote storage device 26.<br>
While the data that is written by the host 22 is accumulated using the active one of<br>
the linked lists 74, 76 (for the sequence number N), the data corresponding to the inactive<br>
one of the linked lists 74, 76 (for previous sequence number N-1) is transmitted from the<br>
local storage device 24 to the remote storage device 26. The RA's 30a-30c use the linked<br>
lists 74-76 to determine the data to transmit from the local storage device 24 to the remote<br>
storage device 26.<br>
Once data corresponding to a particular one of the pointers in one of the linked lists<br>
74, 76 has been transmitted to the remote storage device 26, the particular one of the<br>
pointers may be removed from the appropriate one of the linked lists 74, 76. In addition, the<br>
data may also be marked for removal from the cache 88 (i.e., the slot may be returned to a<br>
pool of slots for later, unrelated, use) provided that the data in the slot is not otherwise<br>
needed for another purpose (e.g., to be destaged to the standard logical device 72). A<br>
mechanism may be used to ensure that data is not removed from the cache 88 until all<br>
devices arc no longer using the data. Such a mechanism is described, for example, in U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,537,568 issued on July 16, 1996 and in U.S. Patent No. 6,594,742, both of<br>
which are incorporated by reference herein.<br>
Referring to Figure 4, a slot 120, like one of the slots 102-104 of the cache 88,<br>
includes a header 122 and data 124. The header 122 corresponds to overhead information<br>
used by the system to mange the slot 120. The data 124 is the corresponding data from the<br>
disk that is being (temporarily) stored in the slot 120. Information in the header 122<br>
includes pointers back to the disk, time stamp(s), etc.<br><br>
The header 122 also includes a cache stamp 126 used in connection with the<br>
system described herein. In an embodiment herein, the cache stamp 126 is eight bytes.<br>
Two of the bytes are a "password" mat indicates whether the slot 120 is being used by<br>
the system described herein. In other embodiments, the password may be one byte<br>
while the following byte is used for a pad. As described elsewhere herein, the two<br>
bytes of the password (or one byte, as the case may be) being equal to a particular value<br>
indicates that the slot 120 is pointed to by at least one entry of the linked lists 74,76.<br>
The password not being equal to the particular value indicates that the slot 120 is not<br>
pointed to by an entry of the linked lists 74,76. Use of the password is described<br>
elsewhere herein.<br>
The cache stamp 126 also includes a two byte field indicating the sequence<br>
number (e.g., N, N-1, N-2, etc.) of the data 124 of the slot 120. As described elsewhere<br>
herein, the sequence number field of the cache stamp 126 may be used to facilitate the<br>
processing described herein. The remaining four bytes of the cache stamp 126 may be<br>
used for a pointer, as described elsewhere herein. Of course, the two bytes of the<br>
sequence number and the four bytes of the pointer are only valid when the password<br>
equals the particular value that indicates that the slot 120 is pointed to by at least one<br>
entry in one of the lists 74,76.<br>
Referring to Figure 5, a flow chart 140 illustrates steps performed by the HA 28<br>
in connection with a host 22 performing a write operation. Of course, when the host 22<br>
performs ft write, processing occurs for handling fha write in a normal fashion<br>
irrespective of whether the data is part of an R1/R2 RDF group. For example, when the<br>
host 22 writes data for a portion of the disk, the write occurs to a cache slot which is<br>
eventually destaged to the disk. The cache slot may either be a new cache slot or may<br>
be an already existing cache slot created in connection wim a previous read and/or<br>
write operation to the same track.<br><br>
Processing begins at a first step 142 where a slot corresponding to the write is<br>
locked. In an embodiment herein, each of the slots 102-104 of the cache 88<br>
corresponds to a track of data on the standard logical device 72. Locking the slot at the<br>
step 142 prevents additional processes from operating on the relevant slot during the<br>
processing performed by the HA 28 corresponding to the steps of the flow chart 140.<br>
Following step 142 is a step 144 where a value for N, the sequence number, is<br>
set As discussed elsewhere herein, the value for the sequence number obtained at the<br>
step 144 is maintained during the entire write operation performed by the HA 28 while<br>
the slot is locked. As discussed elsewhere herein, the sequence number is assigned to<br>
each write to set the one of the chunks of data 52,54 to which the write belongs.<br>
Writes performed by the host 22 are assigned the current sequence number. It is useful<br>
that a single write operation maintain the same sequence number throughout<br>
Following the step 144 is a test step 146 which determines if the password field<br>
of the cache slot is valid. As discussed above, the system described herein sets the<br>
password field to a predetermined value to indicate that the cache slot is already in one<br>
of the linked lists of pointers 74,76. If it is determined at the test step 146 that the<br>
password field is not valid (indicating that the slot is new and that no pointers from the<br>
lists 74,76 point to the slot), then control passes from the step 146 to a step 148, where<br>
the cache stamp of the new slot is set by setting the password to the predetermined<br>
value, setting the sequence number field to N, and setting the pointer field to Null In<br>
other embodiments, the pointer field may be set to point to the slot itself.<br>
Following the step 148 is a step 152 where a pointer to the new slot is added to<br>
the active one of the pointer lists 74,76. In an embodiment herein, the lists 74,76 are<br>
circular doubly linked lists, and the new pointer is added to the circular doubly linked<br>
list in a conventional fashion. Of course, other appropriate data structures could be<br>
used to manage the lists 74,76. Following the step 152 is a step 154 where flags are<br>
set At the step 154, the RDF_WP flag (RDF write pending flag) is set to indicate that<br><br>
the slot needs to be transmitted to the remote storage device 26 using RDF. In addition,<br>
at the step 154, the IN_CACHE flag is set to indicate that the slot needs to be destaged<br>
to the standard logical device 72. Following the step 154 is a step 156 where the data<br>
being written by the host 22 and the HA 28 is written to the slot Following the step<br>
156 is a step 158 where the slot is unlocked. Following step 158, processing is<br>
complete.<br>
If it is determined at the test step 146 mat the password field of the slot is valid<br>
(indicating mat the slot is already pointed to by at least one pointer of the lists 74,76),<br>
then control transfers from the step 146 to a test step 162, where it is determined<br>
whether the sequence number field of the slot is equal to the current sequence number,<br>
N. Note that there are two valid possibilities for the sequence number field of a slot<br>
with a valid password. It is possible for the sequence number field to be equal to N, the<br>
current sequence number. This occurs when the slot corresponds to a previous write<br>
with sequence number N. The other possibility is for the sequence number field to<br>
equal N-1. This occurs when the slot corresponds to a previous write with sequence<br>
number N-1. Any other value for the sequence number field is invalid. Thus, for some<br>
embodiments, it may be possible to include error/validity checking in the step 162 or<br>
possibly make error/validity checking a separate step. Such an error may be handled in<br>
any appropriate fashion, which may include providing a message to a user.<br>
If it is determined at the step 162 that the value in the sequence number field of<br>
the slot equals the current sequence number N, then no special processing is required<br>
and control transfers from the step 162 to the step 156, discussed above, where the data<br>
is written to the slot Otherwise, if the value of the sequence number field is N-1 (the<br>
only other valid value), then control transfers from the step 162 to a step 164 where a<br>
new slot is obtained. The new slot obtained at the step 164 may be used to store me<br>
data being written.<br><br>
Following the step 164 is a step 166 where the data from the old slot is copied<br>
to the new slot that was obtained at the step 164. Note that that the copied data<br>
includes the KDF_WP flag, which should have been set at the step 154 on a previous<br>
write when the slot was first created. Following the step 166 is a step 168 where the<br>
cache stamp for the new slot is set by setting the password field to the appropriate<br>
value, setting the sequence number field to the current sequence number, N, and setting<br>
the pointer field to point to the old slot Following the step 168 is a step 172 where a<br>
pointer to the new slot is added to the active one of the linked lists 74,76. Following<br>
the step 172 is the step 156, discussed above, where the data is written to the slot<br>
which, in mis case, is the new slot<br>
Referring to Figure 6, a flow chart 200 illustrates steps performed in connection<br>
with the RA's 30a-30c scanning the inactive one of the lists 72,74 to transmit RDF data<br>
from the local storage device 24 to the remote storage device 26. As discussed above,<br>
the inactive one of the lists 72,74 points to slots corresponding to the N-1 cycle for the<br>
R1 device when the N cycle is being written to the R1 device by the host using the<br>
active one of the lists 72,74.<br>
Processing begins at a first step 202 where it is determined if there are any<br>
entries in the inactive one of the lists 72,74. As data is transmitted, the corresponding<br>
entries are removed from the inactive one of the lists 72,74. hi addition, new writes<br>
are provided to the active one of the lists 72,74 and not generally to the inactive one of<br>
the lists 72,74. Thus, it is possible (and desirable, as described elsewhere herein) for<br>
the inactive one of the lists 72,74 to contain no data at certain times. If it is<br>
determined at the step 202 that there is no data to be transmitted, then the inactive one<br>
of the lists 72,74 is continuously polled until data becomes available. Data for sending<br>
becomes available in connection with a cycle switch (discussed elsewhere herein)<br>
where the inactive one of the lists 72,74 becomes the active one of the lists 72,74, and<br>
vice versa.<br><br>
If it is determined at the step 202 mat there is data available for sending, control<br>
transfers from the step 202 to a step 204,-where the slot is verified as being correct<br>
The processing performed at the step 204 is an optional "sanity check" that may include<br>
verifying that the password field is correct and verifying that the sequence number field<br>
is correct If mere is incorrect (unexpected) data in the slot error processing may be<br>
performed, which may include notifying a user of the error and possibly error recovery<br>
processing.<br>
Following the step 204 is a step 212, where the data is sent via RDF in a<br>
conventional fashion. In an embodiment herein, the entire slot is not transmitted.<br>
Rather, only records within the slot that have the appropriate mirror bits set (indicating<br>
the records have changed) are transmitted to the remote storage device 26. However, in<br>
other embodiments, it may be possible to transmit the entire slot, provided mat the<br>
remote storage device 26 only writes data corresponding to records having appropriate<br>
mirror bits set and ignores other data for the track, which may or may not be valid.<br>
Following the step 212 is a test step 214 where it is determined if the data that was<br>
transmitted has been acknowledged by the R2 device. Ifnot me data is resent as<br>
indicated by the flow from me step 214 back to the step 212. In other embodiments,<br>
different and more involved processing may used to send data and acknowledge receipt<br>
thereof. Such processing may include error reporting and alternative processing mat is<br>
performed after a certain number of attempts to send the data have failed.<br>
Once it is determined at the test step 214 that the data has been successfully<br>
sent control passes from the step 214 to astep 216 to clear the RDF_WP flag (since the<br>
data has been successfully sent via RDF). Following the step 216 is a test step 218<br>
where it is determined if the slot is a duplicate slot created in connection with a write to<br>
a slot already having an existing entryin the inactive one of me lists 72,74. This<br>
possibility is discussed above in connection with the steps 162,164,166,168,172. If it<br>
is determined at the step 218 that the slot is a duplicate slot then control passes from<br>
the step 218 to a step 222 where the slot is returned to the pool of available slots (to be<br>
reused). In addition, the slot may also be aged (or have some other appropriate<br><br>
mechanism applied thereto) to provide for immediate reuse ahead of other slots since<br>
the data provided in the slot is not valid for any other purpose. Following the step 222<br>
or the step 218 if the slot is not a duplicate slot is a step 224 where the password field<br>
of the slot header is cleared so that when the slot is reused, the test at the step 146 of<br>
Figure 5 properly classifies the slot as a new slot<br>
Following the step 224 is a step 226 where the entry in the inactive one of the<br>
lists 72, 74 is removed. Following the step 226, control transfers back to the step 202,<br>
discussed above, where it is determined if there are additional entries on the inactive<br>
one of the lists 72,74 corresponding to data needing to be transferred.<br>
Referring to Figure 7, a diagram 240 illustrates creation and manipulation of the<br>
chunks 56, 58 used by the remote storage device 26. Data that is received by the<br>
remote storage device 26, via the link 29, is provided to a cache 242 of the remote<br>
storage device 26. The cache 242 may be provided, for example, in the memory 38 of<br>
the remote storage device 26. The cache 242 includes a plurality of cache slots 244-<br>
246, each of which may be mapped to a track of a standard logical storage device 252.<br>
The cache 242 is similar to the cache 88 of Figure 3 and may contain data that can be<br>
destaged to the standard logical storage device 252 of the remote storage device 26.<br>
The standard logical storage device 252 corresponds to the data element 62 shown in<br>
Figure 2 and the disks 34a-34c shown in Figure 1.<br>
The remote storage device 26 also contains a pair of cache only virtual devices<br>
254,256. The cache only virtual devices 254,256 corresponded device tables that may<br>
be stored, for example, in the memory 38 of the remote storage device 26. Each track<br>
entry of the tables of each of the cache only virtual devices 254,256 point to either a<br>
track of the standard logical device 252 or point to a slot of the cache 242.<br><br>
The plurality of cache slots 244-246 may be used in connection to writes to the<br>
standard logical device 252 and, at the same time, used in connection with the cache<br>
only virtual devices 254,256. In an embodiment herein, each of track table entry of me<br>
cache only virtual devices 254,256 contain a null to indicate that the data for mat track<br>
is stored on a corresponding track of the standard logical device 252. Otherwise, an<br>
entry in the track table for each of the cache only virtual devices 254,256 contains a<br>
pointer to one of the slots 244-246 in the cache 242.<br>
Each of the cache only virtual devices 254,256 corresponds to one of the data<br>
chunks 56,58. Thus, for example, the cache only virtual device 254 may correspond to<br>
the data chunk 56 while the cache only virtual device 256 may correspond to the data<br>
chunk 58. In an embodiment herein, one of the cache only virtual devices 254,256<br>
may be deemed "active" while the other one of the cache only virtual devices 254,256<br>
may be deemed "inactive'. The inactive one of the cache only virtual devices 254,256<br>
may correspond to data being received from the local storage device 24 (i.e., the chunk<br>
56) while the active one of the cache only virtual device 254,256 corresponds to data<br>
being restored (written) to the standard logical device 252.<br>
Data from the local storage device 24 that is received via the link 29 maybe<br>
placed in one of the slots 244-246 of the cache 242. A corresponding pointer of the<br>
inactive one of the cache only virtual devices 254,256 may be set to point to the<br>
received data. Subsequent data having the same sequence number may be processed in<br>
a similar manner. At some point, the local storage device 24 provides a message<br>
committing all of the data sent using the same sequence number. Once the data for a<br>
particular sequence number has been committed, the inactive one of the cache only<br>
virtual devices 254,256 becomes active and vice versa. At that point, data from the<br>
now active one of the cache only virtual devices 254,256 is copied to the standard<br>
logical device 252 while the inactive one of the cache only virtual devices 254,256 is<br>
used to receive new data (having a new sequence number) transmitted from the local<br>
storage device 24 to the remote storage device 26.<br><br>
As data is removed from the active one of the cache only virtual devices 254,<br>
256 (discussed elsewhere herein), the corresponding entry in the active one of the cache<br>
only virtual devices 254,256 may be set to null. In addition, the data may also be<br>
removed from the cache 244 (i.e., the slot returned to the pool of free slots for later use)<br>
provided that the data in the slot is not otherwise needed for another purpose (e.g.3 to be<br>
destaged to the standard logical device 252). A mechanism may be used to ensure that<br>
data is not removed from the cache 242 until all mirrors (including the cache only<br>
virtual devices 254,256) are no longer using the data. Such a mechanism is described,<br>
for example, in U.S. Patent No. 5,537,568 issued on July 16,1996 and in U.S. patent<br>
  ; both of which are incorporated by<br>
reference herein.<br>
In some embodiments discussed elsewhere herein, the remote storage device 26<br>
may maintain linked lists 258,262 like the lists 74,76 used by the local storage device<br>
24. The lists 258,262 may contain information that identifies the slots of the<br>
corresponding cache only virtual devices 254,256 that have been modified, where one<br>
of the lists 258,262 corresponds to one of the cache only virtual devices 254,256 and<br>
the other one of the lists 258,262 corresponds to the other one of the cache only virtual<br>
devices 254,256. As discussed elsewhere herein, the lists 258,262 may be used to<br>
facilitate restoring data from the cache only virtual devices 254,256 to the standard<br>
logical device 252.<br>
Referring to Figure 8, a flow chart 270 illustrates steps performed by the remote<br>
storage device 26 in connection with processing data for a sequence number commit<br>
transmitted by the local storage device 24 to the remote storage device 26. As<br>
discussed elsewhere herein, the local storage device 24 periodically increments<br>
sequence numbers. When this occurs, the local storage device 24 finishes transmitting<br>
all of the data for the previous sequence number and then sends a commit message for<br>
the previous sequence number.<br><br>
Processing begins at a first step 272 where the commit is received. Following<br>
the step 272 is a test step 274 which determines if the active one of the cache only<br>
virtual devices 254,256 of the remote storage device 26 is empty. As discussed<br>
elsewhere herein, the inactive one of the cache only virtual devices 254,256 of the<br>
remote storage device 26 is used to accumulate data from the local storage device 24<br>
sent using RDF while the active one of the cache only virtual devices 254,256 is<br>
restored to the standard logical device 252.<br>
If it is determined at the test step 274 that the active one of the cache only<br>
virtual devices 254,256 is not empty, then control transfers from the test step 274 to a<br>
step 276 where the restore for the active one of the cache only virtual devices 254,256<br>
is completed prior to further processing being performed. Restoring data from the<br>
active one of the cache only virtual devices 254,256 is described in more detail<br>
elsewhere herein. It is useful that the active one of the cache only virtual devices 254,<br>
256 is empty prior to handling the commit and beginning to restore date for the next<br>
sequence number.<br>
Following the step 276 or following the step 274 if the active one of the cache<br>
only virtual devices 254,256 is determined to be empty, is a step 278 where the active<br>
one of the cache only virtual devices 254,256 is made inactive. Following the step 278<br>
is a step 282 where the previously inactive one of the cache only virtual devices 254,<br>
256 (i.e., the one that was inactive prior to execution of the step 278) is made active.<br>
Swapping the active and inactive cache only virtual devices 254,256 at the steps 278,<br>
282 prepares the now inactive (and empty) one of the cache only virtual devices 254,<br>
256 to begin to receive data from the local storage device 24 for the next sequence<br>
number.<br>
Following the step 282 is a step 284 where the active one of the cache only<br>
virtual devices 254,256 is restored to me standard logical device 252 of the remote<br>
storage device 26. Restoring the active one of the cache only virtual devices 254,256<br><br>
to the standard logical device 252 is described in more detail hereinafter. However,<br>
note that, in some embodiments, the restore process is begun, but not necessarily<br>
completed, at the step 284. Following the step 284 is a step 286 where the commit that<br>
was sent from the local storage device 24 to the remote storage device 26 is<br>
acknowledged back to the local storage device 24 so that the local storage device 24 is<br>
informed that the commit was successful. Following the step 286, processing is<br>
complete.<br>
Referring to Figure 9, a flow chart 300 illustrates in more detail the steps 276,<br>
284 of Figure 8 where the remote storage device 26 restores the active one of the cache<br>
only virtual devices 254,256. Processing begins at a first step 302 where a pointer is<br>
set to point to the first slot of the active one of the cache only virtual devices 254,256.<br>
The pointer is used to iterate through each track table entry of the active one of the<br>
cache only virtual devices 254,256, each of which is processed individually.<br>
Following the step 302 is a test step 304 where it is determined if the track of the active<br>
one of the cache only virtual devices 254,256 that is being processed points to the<br>
standard logical device 252. If so, then there is nothing to restore. Otherwise, control<br>
transfers from the step 304 to a step a 306 where the corresponding slot of the active<br>
one of the cache only virtual devices 254,256 is locked.<br>
Following the step 306 is a test step 308 which determines if the corresponding<br>
slot of the standard logical device 252 is already in the cache of the remote storage<br>
device 26. if so, then control transfers from the test step 308 to a step 312 where the<br>
slot of the standard logical device is locked. Following step 312 is a step 314 where the<br>
data from the active one of the cache only virtual devices 254,256 is merged with the<br>
data in the cache for the standard logical device 252. Merging the data at the step 314<br>
involves overwriting the data for the standard logical device with the new data of the<br>
active one of the cache only virtual devices 254,256. Note that, in embodiments that<br>
provide for record level flags, it may be possible to simply OR the new records from<br>
the active one of the cache only virtual devices 254,256 to the records of the standard<br>
logical device 252 in the cache. That is, if the records are interleaved, then it is only<br><br>
necessary to use the records from the active one of the cache only virtual devices' 254,<br>
256 that have changed and provide the records to the cache slot of the standard logical<br>
device 252. Following step 314 is a step 316 where the slot of the standard logical<br>
device 252 is unlocked. Following step 316 is a step 318 where the slot of the active<br>
one of the cache only virtual devices 254,256 that is being processed is also unlocked.<br>
If it is determined at the test step 308 that the corresponding slot of the standard<br>
logical device 252 is not in cache, then control transfers from the test step 308 to a step<br>
322 where the track entry for the slot of the standard logical device 252 is changed to<br>
indicate that the slot of the standard logical device 252 is in cache (e.g., an IN_CACHE<br>
flag may be set) and needs to be destaged. As discussed elsewhere herein, in some<br>
embodiments, only records of the track having appropriate mirror bits set may need to<br>
be destaged. Following the step 322 is a step 324 where a flag for the track may be set<br>
to indicate that the data for the track is in the cache.<br>
Following the step 324 is a step 326 where the slot pointer for the standard<br>
logical device 252 is changed to point to the slot in the cache. Following the step 326<br>
is a test step 328 which determines if the operations performed at the steps 322,324,<br>
326 have been successful. In some instances, a single operation called a "compare and<br>
swap" operation may be used to perform the steps 322,324,326. If these operations<br>
are not successful for any reason, then control transfers from the step 328 back to the<br>
step 308 to reexamine if the corresponding track of the standard logical device 252 is in<br>
the cache. Otherwise, if it is determined at the test step 328 that the previous operations<br>
have been successful, men control transfers from the test step 328 to the step 318,<br>
discussed above.<br>
Following the step 318 is a test step 332 which determines if the cache slot of<br>
the active one of the cache only virtual devices 254,256 (which is being restored) is<br>
still being used. In some cases, it is possible that the slot for th z active one of the cache<br>
only virtual devices 254,256 is still being used by another mirror. If it is determined at<br><br>
the test step 332 that the slot of the cache only virtual device is not being used by<br>
another mirror, then control transfers from the test step 332 to a step 334 where the slot<br>
is released for use by other processes (e.g., restored to pool of available slots, as<br>
discussed elsewhere herein). Following the step 334 is a step 336 to point to the next<br>
slot to process the next slot of the active one of the cache only virtual devices 254,256.<br>
Note that the step 336 is also reached from the test step 332 if it is determined at the<br>
step 332 that the active one of the cache only virtual devices 254,256 is still being used<br>
by another mirror. Note also that the step 336 is reached from the test step 304 if it is<br>
determined at the step 304 that, for the slot being processed, the active one of the cache<br>
only virtual devices 254,256 points to the standard logical device 252. Following the<br>
step 336 is a test step 338 which determines if there are more slots of the active one of<br>
the cache only virtual devices 254,256 to be processed. If not, processing is complete.<br>
Otherwise, control transfers from the test step 338 back to the step 304.<br>
In another embodiment, it is possible to construct lists of modified slots for the<br>
received chunk of data 56 corresponding to the N-1 cycle on the remote storage device<br>
26, such as the lists 258,262 shown in Figure 7. As the data is received, the remote<br>
storage device 26 constructs a linked list of modified slots. The lists that are<br>
constructed may be circular, linear (with a NULL termination), or any other appropriate<br>
design. The lists may then be used to restore the active one of the cache only virtual<br>
devices 254,256.<br>
The flow chart 300 of Figure 9 shows two alternative paths 342,344 that<br>
illustrate operation of embodiments where a list of modified slots is used. At the step<br>
302, a pointer (used for iterating through the list of modified slots) is made to point to<br>
the first element of the list Following the step 302 is the step 306, which is reached by<br>
the alternative path 342. In embodiments that use lists of modified slots, the test step<br>
304 is not needed since no slots on the list should point to the standard logical device<br>
252.<br><br>
Following the step 306, processing continues as discussed above with the<br>
previous embodiment, except that the step 336 refers to traversing the list of modified<br>
slots rather than pointing to the next slot in the COVD. Similarly, the test at the step<br>
338 determines if the pointer is at the end of the list (or back to the beginning in the<br>
case of a circular linked list). Also, ifit is determined at the step 338 that there are<br>
more slots to process, then control transfers from the step 338 to the step 306, as<br>
illustrated by the alternative path 344. As discussed above, for embodiments mat use a<br>
list of modified slots, the step 304 may be eliminated.<br>
Referring to Figure 10, a flow chart 350 illustrates steps performed in<br>
connection with the local storage device 24 increasing the sequence number.<br>
Processing begins at a first step 352 where the local storage device 24 waits at least M<br>
seconds prior to increasing the sequence number. Inan embodiment herein, M is thirty,<br>
but of course M could be any number. Larger values for M increase the amount of data<br>
that may be lost if communication between the storage devices 24,26 is disrupted.<br>
However, smaller values for M increase the total amount of overhead caused by<br>
incrementing the sequence number more frequently.<br>
Following the step 352 is a test step 354 which determines if all of me HA's of<br>
the local storage device 24 have set a bit indicating mat the HA's have completed all of<br>
the I/O's for a previous sequence number. When the sequence number changes, each<br>
of the HA's notices the change and sets a bit indicating mat all I/O's of the previous<br>
sequence number are completed. For example, if the sequence number changes from<br>
N-1 to N, an HA will set the bit when the HA has completed all I/O's for sequence<br>
number N-1. Note that, in some instances, a single I/O for an HA may take along time<br>
and may still be in progress even after the sequence number has changed. Note also<br>
that, for some systems, a different mechanism may be used to determine if all of the<br>
HA's have completed their N-1 I/O's. The different mechanism may include<br>
examining device tables in the memory 37.<br><br>
If it is determined at the test step 354 that I/O's from the previous sequence<br>
number have been completed, men control transfers from the step 354 to a test step 356<br>
which determines if the inactive one of the lists 74,76 is empty. Note that a sequence<br>
number switch may not be made unless and until all of the data corresponding to the<br>
inactive one of the lists 74,76 has been completely transmitted from the local storage<br>
device 24 to the remote storage device 26 using the RDF protocol Once the inactive<br>
one of the lists 74,76 is determined to be empty, then control transfers from the step<br>
356 to a step 358 where the commit for the previous sequence number is sent from the<br>
local storage device 24 to the remote storage device 26. As discussed above, the<br>
remote storage device 26 receiving a commit message for a particular sequence number<br>
will cause the remote storage device 26 to begin restoring the data corresponding to die<br>
sequence number.<br>
Following the step 358 is a step 362 where the copying of data for the inactive<br>
oae of the lists 74,76 is suspended. As discussed elsewhere herein, the inactive one of<br>
the lists is scanned to send corresponding data from the local storage device 24 to the<br>
remote storage device 26. It is useful to suspend copying data until the sequence<br>
number switch is completed. In an embodiment herein, the suspension is provided by<br>
sending a message to the RA's 30a-30c. However, it will be appreciated by one of<br>
ordinary skill in the art that for embodiments mat use other components to facilitate<br>
sending data using the system described herein, suspending copying may be provided<br>
by sending appropriate messages/commands to the other components.<br>
Following step 362 is a step 364 where the sequence number is incremented.<br>
Following step 364 is a step 366 where the bits for the HA's mat are used in the test<br>
step 354 are all cleared so that the bits may be set again in connection with the<br>
increment of the sequence number. Following step 366 is a test step 372 which<br>
determines if the remote storage device 26 has acknowledged the commit message sent<br>
at the step 358. Acknowledging the commit message is discussed above in connection<br>
with Figure 8. Once it is determined mat the remote storage device 26 has<br>
acknowledged the commit message sent at the step 358, control transfers from the step<br><br>
372 to a step 374 where the suspension of copying, which was provided at the step 362,<br>
is cleared so that copying may resume. Following step 374, processing is complete.<br>
Note that it is possible to go irom the step 374 back to the step 352 to begin a new cycle<br>
to continuously increment the sequence number.<br>
It is also possible to use COVD's on the Rl device to collect slots associated<br>
with active data and inactive chunks of data. In that case, just as with the R2 device,<br>
one CO VD could be associated with the inactive sequence number and another COVD<br>
could be associated with the active sequence number. This is described below.<br>
Referring to Figure 11, a diagram 400 illustrates items used to construct and<br>
maintain the chunks 52,54. A standard logical device 402 contains data written by the<br>
host 22 and corresponds to the data element 51 of Figure 2 and the disks 33a-33c of<br>
Figure 1. The standard logical device 402 contains data written by the host 22 to the<br>
local storage device 24.<br>
Two cache only virtual devices 404,406 are used in connection with the<br>
standard logical device 402. The cache only virtual devices 404,406 corresponded<br>
device tables that may be stored, tor example, in the memory 37 of the local storage<br>
device 24. Each track entry of the tables of each of the cache only virtual devices 404,<br>
406 point to either a track of the standard logical device 402 or point to a slot of a cache<br>
408 used in connection with the local storage device 24. In some embodiments, the<br>
cache 408 may be provided in the memory 37 of the local storage device 24.<br>
The cache 408 contains a plurality of cache slots 412-414 that may be used in<br>
connection to writes to the standard logical device 402 and, at the same time, used in<br>
connection with the cache only virtual devices 404,406. In an embodiment herein,<br>
each track table entry of the cache only virtual devices 404,406 contains a null to point<br>
to a corresponding track of the standard logical device 402. Otherwise, an entry in the<br><br>
track table for each of the cache only virtual devices 404,406 contains a pointer to one<br>
of the slots 412-414 in the cache 408.<br>
Each of the cache only virtual devices 404,406 may be used for one of the<br>
chunks of data 52,54 so that, for example, the cache only virtual device 404 may<br>
correspond to the chunk of data 52 for sequence number N while the cache only virtual<br>
device 406 may correspond to the chunk of data 54 for sequence number N-1. Thus,<br>
when data is written by the host 22 to the local storage device 24, the data is provided<br>
to the cache 408 and an appropriate pointer of the cache only virtual device 404 is<br>
adjusted. Note that the data will not be removed from the cache 408 until the data is<br>
destaged to the standard logical device 402 and the data is also released by the cache<br>
only virtual device 404, as described elsewhere herein.<br>
In an embodiment herein, one of the cache only virtual devices 404,406 is<br>
deemed "active" while the other is deemed "inactive". Thus, for example, when the<br>
sequence number N is even, the cache only virtual device 404 may be active while the<br>
cache only virtual device 406 is inactive. The active one of the cache only virtual<br>
devices 404,406 handles writes from the host 22 while the inactive one of the cache<br>
only virtual devices 404,406 corresponds to the data mat is being transmitted from the<br>
local storage device 24 to the remote storage device 26.<br>
While the data that is written by the host 22 is accumulated using the active one<br>
of the cache only virtual devices 404,406 (for the sequence number N), the data<br>
corresponding to the inactive one of the cache only virtual devices 404,406 (for<br>
previous sequence number N-1) is transmitted from the local storage device 24 to the<br>
remote storage device 26. For this and related embodiments, the DA's 35a-35c of the<br>
local storage device handle scanning the inactive one of the cache only virtual devices<br>
404,406 to send copy requests to one or more of the RA's 30a-30c to transmit the data<br>
from the local storage device 24 to the remote storage device 26. Thus, the steps 362,<br><br>
374, discussed above in connection with suspending and resuming copying, may<br>
include providing messages/commands to the DA's 35a-35c.<br>
Once the data has been transmitted to the remote storage device 26, the<br>
corresponding entry in the inactive one of the cache only virtual devices 404,406 may<br>
be set to null. In addition, the data may also be removed from the cache 408 (i.e., the<br>
slot returned to the pool of slots for later use) if the data in the slot is not otherwise<br>
needed for another purpose (e.g., to be destaged to the standard logical device 402). A<br>
mechanism may be used to ensure that data is not removed from the cache 408 until all<br>
mirrors (including the cache only virtual devices 404,406) are no longer using the data<br>
Such a mechanism is described, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 5.537,568 issued on<br>
July 16,1996 and in U.S. patent- No. ■ 6594742	 both<br>
of which are incorporated by reference herein.<br>
Referring to Figure 12, a flow chart 440 illustrates steps performed by the<br>
HA 28 in connection with a host 22 performing a write operation for embodiments<br>
where two COVD's are used by the R1 device to provide the system described herein.<br>
Processing begins at a first step 442 where a slot corresponding to the write is locked.<br>
In an embodiment herein, each of the slots 412-414 of the cache 408 corresponds to a<br>
track of data on the standard logical device 402. Locking the slot at the step 442<br>
prevents additional processes from operating on the relevant slot during the processing<br>
performed by the HA 28 corresponding to the steps of the flow chart 440.<br>
Following the step 442 is a step 444 where a value for N, the sequence number,<br>
is set. Just as with the embodiment that uses lists rather than COVD's on the Rl side,<br>
the value for the sequence number obtained at the step 444 is maintained during the<br>
entire write operation performed by the HA 28 while the slot is locked. As discussed<br>
elsewhere herein, the sequence number is assigned to each write to set the one of the<br>
chunks of data 52,54 to which the write belongs. Writes performed by the host 22 are<br><br>
assigned the current sequence number. It is useful that a single write operation<br>
maintain the same sequence number throughout<br>
Following the step 444 is a test step 446, which determines if the inactive one of<br>
the cache only virtual devices 404,406 already points to the slot that was locked at the<br>
step 442 (the slot being operated upon). This may occur if a write to the same slot was<br>
provided when the sequence number was one less than the current sequence number.<br>
The data corresponding to the write for the previous sequence number may not yet have<br>
been transmitted to the remote storage device 26.<br>
If it is determined at the test step 446 that the inactive one of the cache only<br>
virtual devices 404,406 does not point to the slot, then control transfers from the test<br>
step 446 to another test step 448, where it is determined if the active one of the cache<br>
only virtual devices 404,406 points to the slot It is possible for the active one of me<br>
cache only virtual devices 404,406 to point to the slot if there had been a previous<br>
write to the slot while me sequence number was the same as the current sequence<br>
number. If it is determined at the test step 448 that the active one of the cache only<br>
virtual devices 404,406 does not point to the slot, then control transfers from the test<br>
step 448 to a step 452 where anew slot is obtained for the data. Following the step 452<br>
is a step 454 where the active one of the cache only virtual devices 404,406 is made to<br>
point to the slot<br>
Following the step 454, or following the step 448 if the active one of the cache<br>
only virtual devices 404,406 points to the slot, is a step 456 where flags are set At me<br>
step 456, the RDF_WP flag (RDF write pending flag) is set to indicate that the slot<br>
needs to be transmitted to the remote storage device 26 using RDF. In addition, at the<br>
step 456, tiie IN_CACHE flag is set to indicate mat the slot needs to be destaged to the<br>
standard logical device 402. Note that, in some instances, if the active one of the cache<br>
only virtual devices 404,406 already points to the slot (as determined at the step 448) it<br>
is possible that the RDF_WP and IN.CACHE flags were already set prior to execution<br><br><br>
of the step 456. However, setting the flags at the step 456 ensures that the flags are set<br>
properly no matter what the previous state.<br>
Following the step 456 is a step 458 where an indirect flag in the track table that<br>
points to the slot is cleared, indicating that the relevant data is provided in the slot and<br>
not in a different slot indirectly pointed to. Following the step 458 is a step 462 where<br>
the data being written by the host 22 and the HA 28 is written to me slot Following the<br>
step 462 is a step 464 where the slot is unlocked. Following step 464, processing is<br>
complete.<br>
If it is determined at the test step 446 that the inactive one of the cache only<br>
virtual devices 404,406 points to the slot, then control transfers from the step 446 to a<br>
step 472, where a new slot is obtained. The new slot obtained at the step 472 may be<br>
used for the inactive one of the cache only virtual devices 404,406 to effect the RDF<br>
transfer while the old slot may be associated with the active one of the cache only<br>
virtual devices 404,406, as described below.<br>
Following the step 472 is a step 474 where the data from the old slot is copied<br>
to me new slot that was obtained at the step 472. Following the step 474 is a step 476<br>
where the indirect flag (discussed above) is set to indicate that<br>
the inactive one of the cache only virtual devices 404,406 points to the old slot but that<br>
the data is in the new slot which is pointed to by the old slot Thus, setting indirect flag<br>
at the step 476 affects the track table of the inactive one of the cache only virtual<br>
devices 404,406 to cause the track table entry to indicate mat the data is in the new<br>
slot<br>
Following the step 476 is a step 478 where the mirror bits for the records in the<br>
new slot are adjusted. Any local mirror bits that were copied when the data was copied<br>
from the old slot to the new slot at the step 474 are cleared since the purpose of the new<br>
slot is to simply effect the RDF transfer for the inactive one of the cache only virtual<br><br>
devices. The old slot will be used to handle any local mirrors. Following the step 478<br>
is the step 462 where the data is written to the slot Following step 462 is the step 464<br>
where the slot is unlocked. Following the step 464, processing is complete. -<br>
Referring to Figure 13, a flow chart 500 illustrates steps performed in<br>
connection with the local storage device 24 transmitting the chunk of data 54 to the<br>
remote storage device 26. The transmission essentially involves scanning the inactive<br>
one of the cache only virtual devices 404,406 for tracks that have been written thereto<br>
during a previous iteration when the inactive one of the cache only virtual devices 404,<br>
406 was active. In this embodiment, toe DA's 35a-35c of the local storage device 24<br>
scan the inactive one of the cache only virtual devices 404,406 to copy the data lor<br>
transmission to the remote storage device 26 by one or more of the RA's 30a-30c using<br>
the RDF protocol.<br>
Processing begins at a first step 502 where the first track of the inactive one of<br>
the cache only virtual devices 404,406 is pointed to in order to begin the process of<br>
iterating through all of the tracks. Following the first step 502 is a test step 504 where<br>
it is determined if the RDF_WP flag is set As discussed elsewhere herein, the<br>
RDF_WP flag is used to indicate that a slot (track) contains data that needs to be<br>
traramitted via the RDF link. The RDF_WP flag being set indicates that at least some<br>
data for the slot (track) is to be transmitted using RDF. In embodiment herein, the<br>
entire slot is not transmitted. Rather, only records within the slot that have the<br>
appropriate mirror bits set (indicating the records have changed) are transmitted to the<br>
remote storage device 26. However, in other embodiments, it may be possible to<br>
transmit the entire slot, provided mat the remote storage device 26 only writes data<br>
corresponding to records having appropriate mirror bits set and ignores other data for<br>
the track, winch may or may not be valid.<br>
If it is determined at the test step 504 that the cache slot being processed has the<br>
RDF_WP flag set, then control transfers from the step 504 to a test step 505, where it is<br><br>
determinedif the slot contains the data or if the slot is an indirect slot that points to<br>
another slot that contains the relevant data. In some instances, a slot may not contain<br>
the data for the portion of the disk that corresponds to the slot Instead, the slot may be<br>
an indirect slot that points to another slot that contains the data. If it is determined at<br>
the step SOS that the slot is an indirect slot, men control transfers from the step S05 to a<br>
step 506, where the data (from the slot pointed to by the indirect slot) is obtained.<br>
Thus, if the slot is a direct slot, the data for being sent by RDF is stored in the slot while<br>
if the slot is an indirect slot, the data for being sent by RDF is in another slot pointed to<br>
by the indirect slot<br>
Following the step 506 or the step 505 if the slot is a direct slot is a step 507<br>
where data being sent (directly or indirectly from the slot) is copied by one of the DA's<br>
35a-35c to be sent from the local storage device 24 to the remote storage device 26<br>
using the RDF protocol Following the step 507 is a test step 508 where it is<br>
determined if the remote storage device 26 has acknowledged receipt of the data. If<br>
not, then control transfers from the step 508 back to the step 507 to resend the data. In<br>
other embodiments, different and more involved processing may used to send data and<br>
acknowledge receipt thereof. Such processing may include error reporting and<br>
alternative processing that is performed after a certain number of attempts to send the<br>
data have failed.<br>
Once it is determined at the test step J508 that the data has been successfully<br>
sent, control passes from the step 508 to a step 512 to clear the RDF_WP flag (since the<br>
data has been successfully sent via RDF). Following the step 512 is a step 514 where<br>
appropriate mirror flags are cleared to indicate that at least the RDF mirror (R2) no<br>
longer needs the data, man embodiment herein, each record that is part of a slot<br>
(track) has individual mirror flags indicating which mirrors use the particular record.<br>
The E2 device is one of the mirrors for each of the records and it is the flags<br>
corresponding to the R2 device that are cleared at the step 514.<br><br>
Following the step 514 is a test step 516 which determines if any of the records<br>
of the track being processed have any other mirror flags set (for other mirror devices).<br>
If not, then control passes from the step 516 to a step 518 where the slot is released<br>
(i.e., no longer being used). In some embodiments, unused slots are maintained in a<br>
pool of slots available for use. Note that if additional flags are still set for some of the<br>
records of the slot, it may mean that the records need to be destaged to the standard<br>
logical device 402 or are being used by some other mirror (including another R2<br>
device). Following the step 518, or following the step 516 if more mirror flags are<br>
present, is a step 522 where the pointer that is used to iterate through each track entry of<br>
the inactive one of the cache only virtual devices 404,406 is made to point to the next<br>
track. Following the step 522 is a test step 524 which determines if there are more<br>
tracks of the inactive one of the cache only virtual devices 404,406 to be processed. If<br>
not, then processing is complete. Otherwise, control transfers back to the test step 504,<br>
discussed above. Note that the step 522 is also reached from the test step 504 if it is<br>
determined that the RDF_WP flag is not set for the track being processed.<br>
Referring to Figure 14, a diagram 700 illustrates a host 702 coupled to a<br>
plurality of local storage devices 703-705. The diagram 700 also shows a plurality of<br>
remote storage devices 706-708. Although only three local storage devices 703-705<br>
and three remote storage devices 706-708 are shown in the diagram 700, the system<br>
described herein may be expanded to use any number of local and remote storage<br>
devices.<br>
Each of the local storage devices 703-705 is coupled to a corresponding one of<br>
the remote storage devices 706-708 so that, for example, the local storage device 703 is<br>
coupled to the remote storage device 706, the local storage device 704 is coupled to the<br>
remote storage device 707 and the local storage device 705 is coupled to the remote<br>
storage device 7.08. The local storage device is 703-705 and remote storage device is<br>
706-708 may be coupled using the ordered writes mechanism described herein so that,<br>
for example, the local storage device 703 may be coupled to the remote storage device<br>
706 using the ordered writes mechanism. As discussed elsewhere herein, the ordered<br><br>
writes mechanism allows data recovery using the remote storage device in instances<br>
where the local storage device and/or host stops working and/or loses data.<br>
In some instances, the host 702 may run a single application that simultaneously<br>
uses more than one of the local storage devices 703-705. In such a case, the application<br>
may be configured to insure that application data is consistent (recoverable) at the local<br>
storage devices 703-705 if the host 702 were to cease working at any time and/or if one<br>
of the local storage devices 703-705 were to fail. However, since each of the ordered<br>
write connections between the local storage devices 703-705 and the remote storage<br>
devices 706-708 is asynchronous from the other connections, then mere is no assurance<br>
that data for the application will be consistent (and thus recoverable) at the remote<br>
storage devices 706-708. That is, for example, even though the data connection<br>
between the local storage device 703 and the remote storage device 706 (a first<br>
local/remote pair) is consistent and the data connection between the local storage<br>
device 704 and me remote storage device 707 (a second local/remote pair) is consistent,<br>
it is not necessarily the case that the data on the remote storage devices 706,707 is<br>
always consistent if there is no synchronization between the first and second<br>
local/remote pairs.<br>
For applications on the host 702 mat simultaneously use a plurality of local<br>
storage devices 703-705, it is desirable to have the data be consistent and recoverable at<br>
the remote storage devices 706-708. This may be provided by a mechanism whereby<br>
the host 702 controls cycle switching at each of the local storage devices 703-705 so<br>
that the data from the application running on the host 702 is consistent and recoverable<br>
at the remote storage devices 706-708. This functionality is provided by a special<br>
application that runs on the host 702 that switches a plurality of the local storage<br>
devices 703 -705 into multi-box mode, as described in more detail below.<br>
Referring to Figure 15, a table 730 has a plurality of entries 732-734. Each of<br>
the entries 732-734 correspond to a single local/remote pair of storage devices so that,<br><br>
for example, the entry 732 may correspond to pair of the local storage device 703 and<br>
the remote storage device 706, the entry 733 may correspond to pair of the local storage<br>
device 704 and the remote storage device 707 and the entry 734 may correspond to the<br>
pair of local storage device 705 and the remote storage device 708. Each of the entries<br>
732-734 has a plurality of fields where a first field 736a-736c represents a serial<br>
number of the corresponding local storage device, a second field 738a-738c represents<br>
a session number used by the multi-box group, a third field 742a-742c represents the<br>
serial number of the corresponding remote storage device of the local/remote pair, and<br>
a fourth field 744a-744c represents the session number for the multi-box group. The<br>
table 730 is constructed and maintained by the host 702 in connection with operating in<br>
multi-box mode. In addition, the table 730 is propagated to each of the local storage<br>
devices and the remote storage devices that are part of the multi-box group. The table<br>
730 may be used to facilitate recovery, as discussed in more detail below.<br>
Different local/remote pairs may enter and exit multi-box mode independently<br>
in any sequence and at any time. The host 702 manages entry and exit of local storage<br>
device/remote storage device pairs into and out of multi-box mode. This is described in<br>
more detail below.<br>
Referring to Figure 16, a flowchart 750 illustrates steps performed by the host<br>
702 in connection with entry or exit of a local/remote pair in to or out of multi-box<br>
mode. Processing begins at a first step 752 where multi-box mode operation is<br>
temporarily suspended. Temporarily suspending multi-box operation at the step 752 is<br>
useful to facilitate the changes that are made in connection with entry or exit of a<br>
remote/local pair in to or out of multi-box mode. Following the step 752, is a step 754<br>
where a table like the table 730 of Figure 15 is modified to either add or delete an entry,<br>
as appropriate. Following the step 754 is a step 756 where the modified table is<br>
propagated to the local storage devices and remote storage devices of the multi-box<br>
group. Propagating the table at the step 756 facilitates recovery, as discussed in more<br>
detail elsewhere herein.<br><br>
Following the step 756 is a step 758 where a message is sent to the affected<br>
local storage device to provide the change. The local storage device may configure<br>
itself to run in multi-box mode or not, as described in more detail elsewhere herein. As<br>
discussed in more detail below, a local storage device handling ordered writes operates<br>
differently depending upon whether it is operating as part of a multi-box group or not<br>
If the local storage device is being added to a multi-box group, the message sent at the<br>
step 758 indicates to the local storage device that it is being added to a multi-box group<br>
so that the local storage device should configure itself to run in multi-box mode.<br>
Alternatively, if a local storage device is being removed from a multi-box group, the<br>
message sent at the step 758 indicates to the local storage device that it is being<br>
removed from the multi-box group so that the local storage device should configure<br>
itself to not run in multi-box mode.<br>
Following step 758 is a test step 762 where it is determined if a local/remote<br>
pair is being added to the multi-box group (as opposed to being removed). If so, men<br>
control transfers from the test step 762 to a step 764 where tag values are sent to the<br>
local storage device that is being added. The tag values are provided with the data<br>
transmitted from the local storage device to the remote storage device in a manner<br>
similar to providing the sequence numbers with the data. The tag values are controlled<br>
by the host and set so that all of the local/remote pairs send data having the same tag<br>
value during the same cycle. Use of the tag values is discussed in more detail below.<br>
Following the step 764, or following the step 762 if a new local/remote pair is not being<br>
added, is a step 766 where multi-box operation is resumed. Following the step 766,<br>
processing is complete.<br>
Referring to Figure 17, a flow chart 780 illustrates steps performed in<br>
connection with the host managing cycle switching for multiple local/remote pairs<br>
running as a group in multi-box mode. As discussed elsewhere herein, multi-box mode<br>
involves having the host synchronize cycle switches for more than one remote/local pair to maintain data consistency among the remote storage devices. Cycle switching is<br><br>
coordinated by the host rather than being generated internally by the local storage<br>
devices. This is discussed in more detail below.<br>
Processing for the flow chart 780 begins at a test step 782 which determines if<br>
M seconds have passed. Just as with non-multi-box operation, cycle switches occur no<br>
sooner than every M seconds where M is a number chosen to optimize various<br>
performance parameters. As the number M is increased, the amount of overhead<br>
associated with switching decreases. However, increasing M also causes the amount of<br>
data that may be potentially lost in connection with a failure to also increase. In an<br>
embodiment herein, M is chosen to be thirty seconds, although, obviously other values<br>
for M may be used.<br>
If it is determined at the test step 782 that M seconds have not passed, then<br>
control transfers back to the step 782 to continue waiting until M seconds have passed.<br>
Once it is determined at the test step 782 that M seconds have passed, control transfers<br>
from the step 782 to a step 784 where the host queries all of the local storage devices in<br>
the multi-box group to determine if all of me local/remote pairs are ready to switch.<br>
The local/remote pairs being ready to switch is discussed in more detail hereinafter.<br>
Following the step 784 is a test step 786 which determines if all of the<br>
local/remote pairs are ready to switch. If not, control transfers back to the step 784 to<br>
resume the query. In an embodiment herein, his only necessary to query local/remote<br>
pairs that were previously not ready to switch since, once a local/remote pair is ready to<br>
switch, the pair remains so until the switch occurs.<br>
Once it is determined at the test step 786 that all of the local/remote pairs in the<br>
multi-box group are ready to switch, control transfers from the step 786 to a step 788<br>
where an index variable, N, is set equal to one. The index variable N is used to iterate<br>
through all the local/remote pairs (i.e., all of the entries 732-734 of the table 730 of<br>
Figure 15). Following the step 788 is a test step 792 which determines if the index<br><br>
variable, N, is greater than the number of local/remote pairs in the multi-box group. If<br>
not, then control transfers from the step 792 to a step 794 where an open window is<br>
performed for the Nth local storage device of the Nth pair by the host sending a<br>
command (e.g., an appropriate system command) to the Nth local storage device.<br>
Opening the window for the Nth local storage device at the step 794 causes the Nth<br>
local storage device to suspend writes so that any write by a host that is not begun prior<br>
to opening the window at the step 794 will not be completed until the window is closed<br>
(described below). Not completing a write operation prevents a second dependant<br>
write from occurring prior to completion of the cycle switch. Any writes in progress<br>
that were begun before opening the window may complete prior to the window being<br>
closed.<br>
Following the step 794 is a step 796 where a cycle switch is performed for the<br>
Nth local storage device. Performing the cycle switch at the step 796 involves sending<br>
a command from the host 702 to the Nth local storage device. Processing the command<br>
from the host by the Nth local storage device is discussed in more detail below. Part of<br>
the processing performed at the step 796 may include having the host provide new<br>
values for the tags that are assigned to the data. The tags are discussed in more detail<br>
elsewhere herein. In an alternative embodiment, the operations performed at the steps<br>
794,796 may be performed as a single integrated step 797, which is illustrated by the<br>
box drawn around the steps 794,796.<br>
Following the step 796 is a step 798 where the index variable, N, is<br>
incremented. Following step 798, control transfers back to the test step 792 to<br>
determine if the index variable, N, is greater man the number of local/remote pairs.<br>
If it is determined at the test step 792 mat the index variable, N, is greater than<br>
the number of local/remote pairs, then control transfers from the test step 792 to a step<br>
802 where the index variable, N, is set equal to one. Following the step 802 is a test<br>
step 804 which determines if the index variable, N, is greater than the number of<br><br>
local/remote pairs. If not, then control transfers from the step 804 to a step 806 where<br>
the window for the Nth local storage device is closed. Closing the window of the step<br>
806 is performed by the host sending a command to the Nth local storage device to<br>
cause the Nth local storage device to resume write operations. Thus, any writes in<br>
process that were suspended by opening the window at the step 794 may now be<br>
completed after execution of the step 806. Following the step 806, control transfers to<br>
a step 808 where the index variable, N, is incremented. Following the step 808, control<br>
transfers back to the test step 804 to determine if the index variable, N, is greater than<br>
the number of local/remote pairs. If so, then control transfers from the test step 804<br>
back to the step 782 to begin processing for the next cycle switch.<br>
Referring to Figure 18. a flow chart 830 illustrates steps performed by a local<br>
storage device in connection with cycle switching. The flow chart 830 of Figure 18<br>
replaces the flow chart 350 of Figure 10 in instances where the local storage device<br>
supports both multi-box mode and non-multi-box mode. That is, the flow chart 830<br>
shows steps performed like those of the flow chart 350 of Figure 10 to support non-<br>
multi-box mode and, in addition, includes steps for supporting multi-box mode.<br>
Processing begins at a first test step 832 which determines if the local storage<br>
device is operating in multi-box mode. Note mat the flow chart 750 of Figure 16 shows<br>
the step 758 where the host sends a message to the local storage device. The message<br>
sent at the step 758 indicates to the local storage device whether the local storage<br>
device is in multi-box mode or not Upon receipt of the message sent by the host at the<br>
step 758, the local storage device sets an internal variable to indicate whether the local<br>
storage device is operating in multi-box mode or not The internal variable may be<br>
examined at the test step 832.<br>
If it is determined at the test step 832 that the local storage device is not in<br>
multi-box mode, then control transfers from the test step 832 to a step 834 to wait M<br>
seconds for the cycle switch If the local storage device is not operating in multi-box<br><br>
mode, then the local storage device controls its own cycle switching and thus executes<br>
the step 834 to wait M seconds before initiating the next cycle switch.<br>
Following the step 834, or following the step 832 if the local storage device is in<br>
multi-box mode, is a test step 836 which determines if all of the HA's of the local<br>
storage device have set a bit indicating that the HA's have completed all of the I/O's for<br>
a previous sequence number. When the sequence number changes, each of the HA's<br>
notices the change and sets a bit indicating that all I/O's of the previous sequence<br>
number are completed. For example, if the sequence number changes from N-1 to N,<br>
an HA will set the bit when the HA has completed all I/O's for sequence number N-1.<br>
Note that, in some instances, a single I/O for an HA may take a long time and may still<br>
be in progress even after the sequence number has changed. Note also that, for some<br>
systems, a different mechanism may be used to determine if all HA's have completed<br>
their N-1 I/O's. The different mechanism may include examining device tables. Once<br>
it is determined at the test step 836 that all HA's have set the appropriate bit, control<br>
transfers from the test step 836 to a step 888 which determines if the inactive chunk fox<br>
the local storage device is empty. Once it is determined at the test step 888 that the<br>
inactive chunk is empty, control transfers from the step 888 to a step 899, where<br>
copying of data from the local storage device to the remote storage device is suspended.<br>
It is useful to suspend copying data until the sequence number switch is complete.<br>
Following the step 899 is a test step 892 to determine if the local storage device<br>
is in multi-box mode. If it is determined at the test step 892 that the local storage<br>
device is in multi-box mode, then control transfers from the test step 892 to a test step<br>
894 to determine if the active chunk of the corresponding remote storage device is<br>
empty. As discussed in more detail below, the remote storage device sends a message<br>
to the local storage device once it has emptied its active chunk. In response to the<br>
message, the local storage device sets an internal variable that is examined at the test<br>
step 894.<br><br>
Once it is determined at the test step 894 that The active chunk of the remote<br>
storage device is empty, control transfers from the test step 894 to a step 896 where an<br>
internal variable is set on a local storage device indicating that the local storage device<br>
is ready to switch cycles. As discussed above in connection with the flow chart 780 of<br>
Figure 17, the host queries each of the local storage devices to determine if each of the<br>
local storage devices are ready to switch. In response to the query provided by the host,<br>
the local storage device examines the internal variable set at the step 896 and returns<br>
the result to the host<br>
Following step 896 is a test step 898 where the local storage device waits to<br>
receive the command from the host to perform the cycle switch. As discussed above in<br>
connection with the flow chart 780 of Figure 17, the host provides a command to<br>
switch cycles to the local storage device when the local storage device is operating in<br>
multi-box mode. Thus, the local storage device waits for the command at the step 898,<br>
which is only reached when the local storage device is operating in multi-box mode.<br>
Once the local storage device has received the switch command from the host,<br>
control transfers from the step 898 to a step 902 to send a commit message to the<br>
remote storage device. Note that the step 902 is also reached from the test step 892 if it<br>
is determined at the step test 892 that the local storage device is not in multi-box mode.<br>
At the step 902, the local storage device sends a commit message to the remote storage<br>
device, Ihresponse to receiving a commit message for a particular sequence number,<br>
the remote storage device will begin restoring the data corresponding to the sequence<br>
number, as discussed above.<br>
Following the step 902 is a step 906 where the sequence number is incremented<br>
and a new value for the tag (from the host) is stored. The sequence number is as<br>
discussed above. The tag is the tag provided to the local storage device at the step 764<br>
and at the step 796, as discussed above. The tag is used to facilitate data recovery, as<br>
discussed elsewhere herein.<br><br>
Following the step 906 is a step 907 where completion of the cycle switch is<br>
confirmed from the local storage device to the host by sending a message from the local<br>
storage device to the host In some embodiments, it is possible to condition performing<br>
the step 907 on whether the local storage device is in multi-box mode or not, since, if<br>
the local storage device is not in multi-box mode, the host is not necessarily interested<br>
in when cycle switches occur.<br>
Following the step 907 is a step 908 where the bits for the HA's that are used in<br>
the test step 836 are all cleared so that the bits may be set again in connection with the<br>
increment of the sequence number. Following the step 908 is a test step 912 which<br>
determines if the remote storage device has acknowledged the commit message. Note<br>
that if the local/remote pair is operating in multi-box mode and the remote storage<br>
device active chunk was determined to be empty at the step 894, then the remote<br>
storage device should acknowledge the commit message nearly immediately since the<br>
remote storage device will be ready for the cycle switch immediately because the active<br>
chunk thereof is already empty.<br>
Once it is determined at the test step 912 that the commit message has been<br>
acknowledged by the remote storage device, control transfers from the step 912 to a<br>
step 914 where the suspension of copying, which was provided at the step 899, is<br>
cleared so that copying from the local storage device to the remote storage device may<br>
resume. Following the step 914, processing is complete.<br>
Referring to Figure 19, a flow chart 940 illustrates steps performed in<br>
connection with RA's scanning the inactive buffers to transmit RDF data from the local<br>
storage device to the remote storage device. The flow chart 940 of Figure 19 is similar<br>
to the flow chart 200 of Figure 6 and similar steps are given the same reference<br>
number. However, the flow chart 940 includes two additional steps 942,944 which are<br>
not found in the flow chart 200 of Figure 6. The additional steps 942,944 are used to<br>
facilitate multi-box processing. After data has been sent at the step 212, control<br><br>
transfers from the step 212 to a test step 942 which determines if the data being sent is<br>
the last data in the inactive chunk of the local storage device. If not, then control<br>
transfers from the step 942 to the step 214 and processing continues as discussed above<br>
in connection with the flow chart 200 of Figure 6. Otherwise, if it is determined at the<br>
test step 942 that the data being sent is the last data of the chunk, then control transfers<br>
from the step 942 to the step 944 to send a special message from the local storage<br>
device to the remote storage device indicating that the last data has been sent<br>
Following the step 944, control transfers to the step 214 and processing continues as<br>
discussed above in connection with the flow chart 200 of Figure 6. In some<br>
embodiments, the steps 942,944 may be performed by a separate process (and/or<br>
separate hardware device) that is different from the process and/or hardware device that<br>
transfers the data.<br>
Referring to Figure 20, a flow chart 950 illustrates steps performed in<br>
connection with RA' s scanning the inactive buffers to transmit RDF data from the local<br>
storage device to the remote storage device. The flow chart 950 of Figure 20 is similar<br>
to the flow chart 500 of Figure 13 and similar steps are given the same reference<br>
number. However, the flow chart 950 includes an additional step 952, which is not<br>
found in the flow chart 500 of Figure 13. The additional steps 952 is used to facilitate<br>
multi-box processing and is like the additional step 944 of the flowchart 940 of Figure<br>
19. After it is determined at the test step 524 that nomore slots remain to be sent from<br>
the local storage device to the remote storage device, control transfers from the step<br>
524 to the step 952 to send a special message from the local storage device to the<br>
remote storage device indicating that the last data for the chunk has been sent<br>
Following the step 952, processing is complete.<br>
Referring to Figure 21, a flow chart 960 illustrates steps performed at the<br>
remote storage device in connection with providing an indication mat the active chunk<br>
of the remote storage device is empty. The flow chart 960 is like the flow chart 300 of<br>
Figure 9 except that the flow chart 960 shows a new step 962 that is performed after the<br>
active chunk of the remote storage device has been restored. At the step 962, the<br><br>
remote storage device sends a message to the local storage device indicating that the<br>
active chunk of the remote storage device is empty. Upon receipt of the message sent<br>
at the step 962, the local storage device sets an internal variable indicating that the<br>
inactive buffer of the remote storage device is empty. The local variable is examined in<br>
connection with the test step 894 of the flow chart 830 of Figure 18, discussed above.<br>
Referring to Figure 22, a diagram 980 illustrates the host 702, local storage<br>
devices 703-705 and remote storage devices 706-708, that are shown in the diagram<br>
700 of Figure 14. The Diagram 980 also includes a fust alternative host 982 that is<br>
coupled to the host 702 and the local storage devices 703-705. The diagram 980 also<br>
includes a second alternative host 984 that is coupled to the remote storage devices<br>
706-708. The alternative hosts 982,984 may be used for data recovery, as described in<br>
more detail below.<br>
When recovery of data at the remote site is necessary, the recovery may be<br>
performed by the host 702 or, by the host 982 provided that the links between the local<br>
storage devices 703-705 and the remote storage devices 706-708 are still operational.<br>
If the links are not operational, then data recovery may be performed by the second<br>
alternative host 984 that is coupled to the remote storage devices 706-708. The second<br>
alternative host 984 may be provided in the same location as one or more of the remote<br>
storage devices 706-708. Alternatively, the second alternative host 984 may be remote<br>
from all of the remote storage devices 706-708. The table 730 that is propagated<br>
throughout the system is accessed in connection with data recovery to determine the<br>
members of the multi-box group.<br>
Referring to Figure 23, a flow chart 1000 illustrates steps performed by each of<br>
the remote storage devices 706-708 in connection with the data recovery operation.<br>
The steps of the flowchart 1000 may be executed by each of the remote storage devices<br>
706-708 upon receipt of a signal or a message indicating that data recovery is<br>
necessary. In some embodiments, it may be possible for a remote storage device to<br><br>
automatically sense that data recovery is necessary using, for example, conventional<br>
criteria such as length of time since last write.<br>
Processing begins at a first step 1002 where the remote storage device finishes<br>
restoring the active chunk in a manner discussed elsewhere herein. Following the step<br>
1002 is a test step 1004 which determines if the inactive chunk of the remote storage<br>
device is complete (i.e., all of the data has been written thereto). Note mat a remote<br>
storage device may determine if the inactive chunk is complete using the message sent<br>
by the local storage device at the steps 944,952, discussed above. That is, if the local<br>
storage device has sent the message at the step 944 or the step 952, then the remote<br>
storage device may use receipt of mat message to confirm that the inactive chunk is<br>
complete.<br>
If it is determined at the test step 1004 that the inactive chunk of the remote<br>
storage device is not complete, then control transfers from the test step 1004 to a step<br>
1006 where the data from the inactive chunk is discarded. No data recovery is<br>
performed using incomplete inactive chunks since the data therein may be inconsistent<br>
with the corresponding active chunks. Accordingly, data recovery is performed using<br>
active chunks and, in some cases, inactive chunks that are complete. Following the<br>
step 1006, processing is complete.<br>
If it is determined at the test step 1004 that the inactive chunk is complete, men<br>
control transfers from the step 1004 to the step 1008 where the remote storage device<br>
waits for intervention by the host If an inactive chunk, one of the hosts 702,982,984,<br>
as appropriate, needs to examine the state of all of the remote storage devices in the<br>
multi-box group to determine how to perform the recovery. This is discussed in more<br>
detail below.<br>
Following step 1008 is a test step 1012 where it is determined if the host has<br>
provided a command to all storage device to discard the inactive chunk. If so, then<br><br>
control transfers from the step 1012 to the step 1006 to discard the inactive chunk.<br>
Following the step 1006, processing is complete.<br>
If it is determined at the test step 1002 that the host has provided a command to<br>
restore the complete inactive chunk, then control transfers from the step 1012 to a step<br>
1014 where the inactive chunk is restored to the remote storage device. Restoring the<br>
inactive chunk in the remote storage device involves making the inactive chunk an<br>
active chunk and then writing the active chunk to the disk as described elsewhere<br>
herein. Following the step 1014, processing is complete.<br>
Referring to Figure 24, a flow chart 1030 illustrates steps performed in<br>
connection with one of the hosts 702,982,984 determining whether to discard or<br>
restore each of the inactive chunks of each of the remote storage devices. The one of<br>
the hosts 702,982,984 that is performing the restoration communicate with the<br>
remote storage devices 706-708 to provide commands thereto and to receive<br>
information therefrom using the tags that are assigned by the host as discussed<br>
elsewhere herein.<br>
Processing begins at a first step 1032 where it is determined if any of the remote<br>
storage devices have a complete inactive chunk. If not, then there is no further<br>
processing to be performed and, as discussed above, the remote storage devices will<br>
discard the incomplete chunks on their own without host intervention. Otherwise,<br>
control transfers from the test step 1032 to a test step 1034 where the host determines if<br>
all of the remote storage devices have complete inactive chunks. If so, then control<br>
transfers from the test step 1034 to a test step 1036 where it is determined if all of the<br>
complete inactive chunks of all of the remote storage devices have the same tag<br>
number. As discussed elsewhere herein, tags are assigned by the host and used by the<br>
system to identify data in a manner similar to the sequence number except that tags are<br>
controlled by the host to have the same value for the same cycle.<br><br>
If it is determined at the test step 1036 that all of the remote storage devices<br>
have the same tag for the inactive chunks, then control transfers from the step 1036 to a<br>
step 1038 where all of the inactive chunks are restored. Performing the step 1038<br>
ensures that all of the remote storage devices have data from the same cycle. Following<br>
the step 1038, processing is complete.<br>
If it is determined at the test step 1034 that all of the inactive chunks are not<br>
complete, or if it is determined that at the step 1036 that all of the complete inactive<br>
chunks do not have the same tag, men control transfers to a step 1042 where the host<br>
provides a command to the remote storage devices to restore the complete inactive<br>
chunks having the lower tag number. For purposes of explanation, it is assumed that<br>
the tag numbers are incremented so that a lower tag number represents older data. By<br>
way of example, if a first remote storage device had a complete inactive chunk with a<br>
tag value of three and a second remote storage device had a complete inactive chunk<br>
with a tag value of four, the step 1042 would cause the first remote storage device (but<br>
not the second) to restore its inactive chunk. Following the step 1042 is a step 1044<br>
where the host provides commands to the remote storage devices to discard the<br>
complete inactive buffers having a higher tag number (e.g., the second remote storage<br>
device in the previous example). Following step 1044, processing is complete.<br>
Following execution of the step 1044, each of the remote storage devices<br>
contains data associated with the same tag value as data for the other ones of the remote<br>
storage devices. Accordingly, the recovered data on the remote storage devices 706-<br>
708 should be consistent<br>
