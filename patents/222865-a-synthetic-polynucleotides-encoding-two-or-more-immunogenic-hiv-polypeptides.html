				<td>Technical Field<br>
Polynucleotides encoding antigenic HIV polypeptides (e.g., those shown in<br>
Table C) are described, as are uses of these polynucleotides and polypeptide products<br>
including formulations of immunogenic compositions and uses thereof.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is recognized as one of the<br>
greatest health threats facing modern medicine. There is, as yet, no cure for this<br>
disease.<br>
In 1983-1984, three groups independently identified the suspected etiological<br>
agent of AIDS. See, e.g., Barre-Sinoussi et al. (1983) Science 220:868-871;<br>
Montagnier et al., in Human T-CeE Leukemia Viruses (Gallo, Essex &amp; Gross, eds.,<br>
1984); Vilmer et al. (1984) The Lancet 1:753; Popovic et al. (1984) Science<br>
224:497-500; Levy et al. (1984) Science 225:840-842. These isolates were variously<br>
called lymphadenopathy-associated virus (LAV), human T-cell lymphotropic virus<br>
type IDE (HTLV-III), or AIDS-associated retrovirus (ARV). All of these isolates are<br>
strains of the same virus, and were later collectively named Human Immunodeficiency<br>
Virus (HIV). With the isolation of a related AIDS-causing virus, the strains originally<br>
called HIV are now termed HIV-1 and the related virus is called HIV-2 See, e.g.,<br>
Guyader et al., (1987) Nature 326:662-669; Brun-Vezinet et al. (1986) Science<br>
233:343-346; Clavel et al., (1986) Nature 324:691-695.<br>
A great deal of information has been gathered about the HIV virus, however,<br>
to date an effective vaccine has not been identified. Several targets for vaccine<br>
development have been examined including the env and Gag gene products encoded<br>
by HIV. Gag gene products include, but are not limited to, Gag-polymerase and Gag-<br>
protease. Env gene products include, but are not limited to, monomeric gp120<br>
polypeptides, oligomeric gp140 polypeptides and gp160 polypeptides.<br>
Haas, et al., (Current Biology 6(3):315-324, 1996) suggested that selective<br>
codon usage by HIV-1 appeared to account for a substantial fraction of the inefficiency<br>
of viral protein synthesis. Andre, et al., (J. Virol. 72(2): 1497-1503, 1998) described<br>
an increased immune response elicited by DNA vaccination employing a synthetic<br>
gpl20 sequence with modified codon usage. Schneider, et aL, (J Virol. 71(7):4892-<br>
4903,1997) discuss inactivation of inhibitory (or instability) elements (INS) located<br>
within the coding sequences of the Gag and Gag-protease coding sequences.<br>
The Gag proteins of HIV-1 are necessary for the assembly of virus-like<br>
particles. HIV-1 Gag protems are involved in many stages of the life cycle of the virus<br>
including, assembly, virion maturation after particle release, and early post-entry steps<br>
in virus replication. The roles of HIV-1 Gag proteins are numerous and complex<br>
(Freed, E.O., Virology 251:1-15, 1998).<br>
Wolf, et al., (PCT International Application, WO 96730523, published 3<br>
October 1996; European Patent Application, Publication No. 0 449 116 Al, published<br>
2 October 1991) have described the use of altered pr55 Gag of HIV-1 to act as a non-<br>
infectious retroviral-like particulate carrier, in particular, for the presentation of<br>
immunologically important epitopes. Wang, et aL, (Virology 298:524-534,1994)<br>
describe a system to study assembly of HIV Gag-ß-galactosidase fusion proteins into<br>
vinous. They describe the construction of sequences encoding HIV Gag-ß-<br>
galactosidase fusion proteins, the expression of such sequences in the presence of HIV<br>
Gag proteins, and assembly of these protems into virus particles.<br>
Shiver, et aL, (PCT International Application, WO 98/34640, published 13<br>
August 1998) described altering HIV-1 (CAM1) Gag coding sequences to produce<br>
synthetic DNA molecules encoding HIV Gag and modifications of HIV Gag. The<br>
codons of the synthetic molecules were codons preferred by a projected host cell.<br>
Recently, use of HIV Env polypeptides in immunogenic compositions has been<br>
described, (see, U.S. Patent No. 5,846,546 to Hurwitz et aL, issued December 8,<br>
1998, describing immunogenic compositions comprising a mixture of at least four<br>
different recombinant virus that each express a different HIV env variant; and U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,840,313 to Vahlne et al., issued November 24, 1998, describing peptides<br>
which correspond to epitopes of the HIV-1 gp120 protein). In addition, U.S. Patent<br>
No. 5,876,731 to Sia et al, issued March 2, 1999 describes candidate vaccines against<br>
HIV comprising an ammo acid sequence of a T-cell epitope of Gag linked directly to<br>
an amino acid sequence of a B-cell epitope of the V3 loop protein of an HIV-1 isolate<br>
containing the sequence GPGR.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Described herein are novel HIV sequences, polypeptides encoded by these<br>
novel sequences, and synthetic expression cassettes generated from these and other HIV<br>
sequences. In one aspect, the present invention relates to improved HIV<br>
expression cassettes. In a second aspect, the present invention relates to generating an<br>
immune response in a subject using the expression cassettes of the present invention.<br>
In a further aspect, the present invention relates to generating an immune response in a<br>
subject using the expression cassettes of the present invention, as well as, polypeptides<br>

Thus, one aspect of the present invention relates to expression cassettes and<br>
polynucleotides contained therein. The expression cassettes typically include an HIV-<br>
polypeptide encoding sequence inserted into an expression vector backbone. In one<br>
embodiment, an expression cassette comprises a polynucleotide sequence encoding<br>
one or more polypeptides, wherein the polynucleotide sequence comprises a sequence<br>
having between about 85% Id 100% and any integer values therebetween, for example,<br>
at least about 85%, preferably about 90%, more preferably about 95%, and more<br>
preferably about 98% sequence identity to the sequences taught in the present<br>
specification.<br>
The polynucleotides encoding the HIV polypeptides of the present invention<br>
may also include sequences encoding additional polypeptides. Such additional<br>
polynucleotides encoding polypeptides may include, for example, coding sequences for<br>
other viral proteins (e.g., hepatitis B or C or other HIV proteins, such as,<br>
polynucleotide sequences encoding an HIV Gag polypeptide, polynucleotide<br>
sequences encoding an HIV Env polypeptide and/or polynucleotides encoding one or<br>
more of vif, vpr, tat, rev, vpo and nef); cytokines or other transgenes.<br>
In one embodiment, the sequence encoding the HIV Pol polypeptide(s) can be<br>
modified by deletions of coding regions corresponding to reverse transcriptase and<br>
integrase. Such deletions in the polymerase polypeptide can also be made such that the<br>
polynucleotide sequence preserves T-hehier cell and CTL epitopes. Other antigens of<br>
interest may be inserted into the polymerase as well.<br>
In another embodiment, an expression cassette comprises a synthetic<br>
polynucleotide comprises at least one polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide<br>
comprising a Type B antigen and at least one polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide<br>
comprising a Type C antigen, wherein said synthetic polynucleotide sequences<br>
comprises coding sequences selected from, but not limited to, the following:<br>

an Env-derived-polypeptide-encoding polynucleotide. Such compositions may further<br>
contain an adjuvant or adjuvants. The compositions may also contain one or more HIV<br>
polypeptides. The HIV polypeptides may correspond to the polypeptides<br>
encoded by the expression cassette(s) in the composition, or may be different from<br>
those encoded by the expression cassettes. In compositions containing both<br>
expression cassettes (or polynucleotides of the present invention) and polypeptides,<br>

with various HIV polypeptides described herein.<br>
In another aspect the present invention includes methods of immunization of a<br>
subject. In the method any of the above described compositions are into the subject<br>
under conditions that are compatible with expression of the expression cassette(s) in<br>
the subject. In one embodiment, the expression cassettes (or polynucleotides of the<br>
present invention) can be introduced using a gene delivery vector. The gene delivery<br>
vector can, for example, be a non-viral vector or a viral vector. Exemplary viral<br>
vectors include, but are not limited to eucaryotic layered vector initiation systems,<br>
Sindbis-virus derived vectors, retro viral vectors, and lentrviral vectors. Other<br>

response in a subject. Any of the expression cassettes described herein can be<br>
expressed in a suitable cell to provide for the expression of the HIV polypeptides<br>
encoded by the polynucleotides of the present invention. The polypeptide(s) are then<br>
isolated (e.g., substantially purified) and administered to the subject in an amount<br>
sufficient to elicit an immune response. In certain embodiments, the methods comprise<br>
administration of one or more of the expression cassettes or polynucleotides of the<br>
present invention, using any of the gene delivery techniques described herein. In other<br>
embodiments, the methods comprise co-administration of one or more of the<br>
expression cassettes or polynucleotides of the present invention and one or more<br>
polypeptides, wherein the polypeptides can be expressed from these polynucleotides or<br>

administration of multiple expression cassettes or polynucleotides of the present<br>
invention. In still further embodiments, the methods comprise co-administration of<br>
multiple polypeptides, for example polypeptides expressed from the polynucleotides of<br>
the present invention and/or other HIV polypeptides.<br>
The invention further includes methods of generating an immune response in a<br>
subject, where cells of a subject are transfected with any of the above-described<br>
expression cassettes or polynucleotides of the present invention, under conditions that<br>
permit the expression of a selected polynucleotide and production of a polypeptide of<br>
interest (e.g., encoded by any expression cassette of the present invention). By this<br>
method an immunological response to the potypeptide is elicited in the subject.<br>
Transfection of the cells may be performed ex vivo and the transfected cells are<br>
reintrodnced into the subject Alternately, or in addition, the cells may be transfected<br>
in vivo in the subject. The immune response may be humoral and/or cell-mediated<br>
(cellular). In a further embodiment, this method may also include administration of an<br>
HIV polypeptides before, concurrently with, and/or after introduction of the<br>
expression cassette into the subject.<br>
The polynucleotides of the present invention may be employed singly or in<br>
combination. The polynucleotides of the present invention, encoding HIV-derived<br>
polypeptides, may be expressed in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to the<br>
following: a polynucleotide encoding a single gene product (or portion thereof)<br>
expressed from a promoter; multiple polynucleotides encoding a more than one gene<br>
product (or portion thereof) (e.g., polycistronic coding sequences); multiple<br>
polynucleotides in-frame to produce a single polyprotein; and, multiple polynucleotides<br>
in-frame to produce a single polyprotein wherein the polyprotein has protein cleavage<br>
sites between one or more of the polypeptides comprising the polyprotein.<br>

and C. In addition other HIV subtypes may be used in combination as well, for<br>
example, Type A, Type B, Type C, Type D, Type E, Type F, Type G, Type O, etc.<br>
The HIV polypeptides may encode antigens or epitopes from any HIV<br>
polypeptide, including but not limited to HIV polypeptides are selected from the<br>
following group: Gag, Env, Pol, Tat, Rev, Nef, Vpr, Vpu, Vif and combinations<br>
thereof. Other HIV polypeptides comprising antigens or epitopes are described herein<br>
(see, for example, Table A). In one embodiment the synthetic polynucleotide encodes<br>
Tat, Rev and Nef polypeptides. In another embodiment, the synthetic polynucleotide<br>
encodes Vif, Vpr and Vpu polypeptides.<br>
The HIV polypeptides encoded by a synthetic polynucleotide may comprise<br>
one or more mutations affecting polypeptide activity or function that, for example,<br>
reduce (relative to wild-type), attenuate, inactivate, eliminate, or render non-functional<br>
the activity or function of the gene product(s) encoded the synthetic polynucleotide.<br>
For example, the synthetic polynucleotide may encode HIV polypeptides that comprise<br>
Pol. The mutations may, for example, be selected from the group consisting of<br>
mutations that reduce or eliminate protease function, mutations that delete the catalytic<br>
center of primer grip region of reverse transcriptase, mutations that inactive the<br>
catalytic center of DNA binding domain of integrase. In another example, the<br>
synthetic polynucleotide may encode HIV polypeptides that comprise Env. The<br>
mutations may, for example, comprise mutations in the cleavage site or mutations in<br>
the glycosylation site. In another example, the synthetic polynucleotide may encode<br>
HIV polypeptides that comprise Tat. The mutations may, for example, comprise<br>
mutations in the transactivation domain. In another example, the synthetic<br>
polynucleotide may encode HIV polypeptides that comprise Rev. The mutations may,<br>
for example, comprise mutations in the RNA binding-nuclear localization region or<br>
mutations in the activation domain. In another example, the synthetic polynucleotide<br>
may comprise HIV polypeptides that comprise Nef. The mutations may, for example,<br>
comprise mutations of myristoylation signal, mutations in oligomerization, mutations<br>
affecting infectivity and mutations affecting CD4 down regulation. In yet a further<br>
example, the synthetic polynucleotide may encode HIV polypeptides that comprise vif,<br>
vpr, and/or vpu. These polypeptides may also comprise mutations.<br>
In a further aspect of the present invention, the synthetic polynucleotide may<br>
comprise a sequence encoding an additional antigenic polypeptide or epitope derived<br>
from an antigenic polypeptide.<br>

expression systems. Control elements to be employed in expression cassettes may<br>
include, but are not limited to, a transcription promoter, a transcription enhancer<br>
element, a transcription termination signal, polyadenylation sequences, sequences for<br>
optimization of initiation of translation, and translation termination sequences.<br>

A, SV40, RSV, HIV-Ltr, MMLV-ltr, and metallothionein.<br>
In another aspect the present invention includes cells comprising the above-<br>
described synthetic polynucleotides, where typically expression cassettes comprise the<br>
synthetic polynucleotide(s). Exemplary cells include, but are not limited to mammalian<br>
cells (e.g, BHK, VERO, HT1080,293, RD, COS-7, and CHO cells), insect cells (e.g.,<br>
Trichoplusia ni (Tn5) or Sf9 insect cells), bacterial cells, yeast cells, plant cells,<br>

expression cassette which encodes a polypeptide including two or more HIV<br>
polypeptides from different subtypes. The expression cassette typically comprises a<br>
synthetic polynucleotide sequence operably linked to control elements compatible with<br>
expression in the subject. The present invention also includes a method of DNA<br>
immunization of a subject. Typically the method includes introducing a gene delivery<br>
vector of the present invention into the subject under conditions that are compatible<br>
with expression of the expression cassette in the subject. Exemplary gene delivery<br>
vectors include, but are not limited to, nonviral vectors, paniculate carriers, and viral<br>
vectors (e.g., retroviral or lentiviral vectors). The gene delivery vectors may, for<br>
example, be coated on a gold or tungsten particle and the coated particle delivered to<br>
the subject using a gene gun, or the vector may be encapsulated in a liposome<br>
preparation. The subject may be a mammal, e.g., a human.<br>
In another aspect the present invention includes, a method of generating an<br>
immune response in a subject. Typically the method comprises transfecting cells of the<br>
subject using a gene delivery vector (e.g., as described above), under conditions that<br>
permit the expression of the polynucleotide and production of the polypeptide<br>
including two or more HIV polypeptides from different subtypes, thereby eliciting an<br>
immunological response to the polypeptide. Exemplary gene delivery vectors include,<br>
but are not limited to, nonviral vectors, particulate carriers, and viral vectors (e.g.,<br>
retroviral or lentiviral vectors). The gene delivery vectors may, for example, be coated<br>
on a gold or tungsten particle and the coated particle delivered to the subject using a<br>
gene gun, or the vector may be encapsulated in a liposome preparation. The subject<br>
may be a mammal, e.g., a human. Cells of the subject may be transfected ex vivo and<br>
the transfected cells reintroduced into the subject. Alternately, the transfecting may be<br>
done in vivo in the subject. The immune response that is generated may, for example,<br>
be a humoral immune response and/or a cellular immune response.<br>
Gene delivery vectors may be administered, for example, intramuscularly,<br>
intramucosally, intranasally, subcutaneously, intradermally, transdermafly,<br>
intravaginally, intrarectally, orally or intravenously.<br>

1. Definitions<br>
In describing the present invention, the following terms will be employed, and<br>
are intended to be defined as indicated below.<br>
"Synthetic" sequences, as used herein, refers to HIV polypeptide-encoding<br>
polynucleotides whose expression has been modified as described herein, for example,<br>
by codon substitution, altered activities, and/or inactivation of inhibitory sequences.<br>
"Wild-type" or "native" sequences, as used herein, refers to polypeptide encoding<br>
sequences that are essentially as they are found in nature, e.g., Gag, Pol, Vif, Vpr, Tat,<br>
Rev, Vpu, Env and/or Nef encoding sequences as found in HIV isolates, e.g., SF162,<br>
SF2, API 10965, AF110967, AF110968, AF110975, 8_5_TV1_C.ZA,<br>
8_2_TV1_CZA or 12-5_1_TV2_CZA. The various regions of the HIV genome are<br>
shown in Table A, with numbering relative to 8_5_TV1_C.ZA (Figures 1A-1D).<br>
Thus, the term "Pol" refers to one or more of the following polypcptides: poh/merase<br>
(p6Pol); protease (prot); reverse transcriptase (p66RT or RT); RNAseH<br>
(p1 5RNAseH); and/or integrase (p31 Int or Int). Identification of gene regions for any<br>
selected HIV isolate can be performed by one of ordinary skill in the art based on the<br>
teachings presented herein and the information known in the art, for example, by<br>
performing alignments relative to 8_5_TV1_C.ZA (Figures 1A-1D) or alignment to<br>
other known HIV isolates, for example, Subtype B isolates with gene regions (e.g.,<br>
SF2, GenBank Accession number K02007; SF162, GenBank Accession Number<br>
M38428) and Subtype C isolates with gene regions (e.g., GenBank Accession Number<br>
AF110965 and GenBank Accession Number AF110975).<br>
As used herein, the term "virus-like particle" or "VLP" refers to a<br>
nonreplicating, viral shell, derived from any of several viruses discussed further below.<br>
VLPs are generally composed of one or more viral proteins, such as, but not limited to<br>
those proteins referred to as capsid, coat, shell, surface and/or envelope proteins, or<br>
particle-forming polypeptides derived from these proteins. VLPs can form<br>
spontaneously upon recombinant expression of the protein in an appropriate<br>
expression system. Methods for producing particular VLPs are known in the art and<br>
discussed more fully below. The presence of VLPs following recombinant expression<br>
of viral proteins can be detected using conventional techniques known in the art, such<br>
as by electron microscopy, X-ray crystallography, and the like. See, e.g., Baker et al.,<br>
Biophys. J. (1991) 60:1445-1456; Hagensee et al., J. Virol. (1994) 68:4503-4505.<br>
For example, VLPs can be isolated by density gradient centrifugation and/or identified<br>
by characteristic density banding. Alternatively, cryoelectron microscopy can be<br>
performed on vitrified aqueous samples of the VLP preparation in question, and<br>
images recorded under appropriate exposure conditions.<br>
By 'particle-forming polypeptide" derived from a particular viral protein is<br>
meant a full-length or near full-length viral protein, as well as a fragment thereof, or a<br>
viral protein with internal deletions, which has the ability to form VLPs under<br>
conditions that favor VLP formation. Accordingly, the polypeptide may comprise the<br>
full-length sequence, fragments, truncated and partial sequences, as well as analogs<br>
and precursor forms of the reference molecule. The term therefore intends deletions,<br>
additions and substitutions to the sequence, so long as the polypeptide retains the<br>
ability to form a VLP. Thus, the term includes natural variations of the specified<br>
polypeptide since variations in coat proteins often occur between viral isolates. The<br>
term also includes deletions, additions and substitutions that do not naturally occur in<br>
the reference protein, so long as the protein retains the ability to form a VLP.<br>
Preferred substitutions are those which are conservative in nature, i.e., those<br>
substitutions that take place within a family of amino acids that are related in their side<br>
chains. Specifically, amino acids are generally divided into four families: (1) acidic —<br>
aspartate and glutamate; (2) basic ~ lysine, arginine, histidine; (3) non-polar — alanine,<br>
valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine, tryptophan; and (4)<br>
uncharged polar — glycine, asparagine, glutamine, cystine, serine threonine, tyrosine.<br>
Phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine are sometimes classified as aromatic amino<br>
acids.<br>
The term "HIV polypeptide" refers to any amino acid sequence that exhibits<br>
sequence homology to native HIV polypeptides (e.g., Gag, Env, Prot, Pol, RT, Int, vif,<br>
vpr, vpu, tat, rev, nef and/or combinations thereof) and/or which is functional. Non-<br>
limiting examples of functions that may be exhibited by HIV polypeptides include, use<br>
as immunogens (e.g., to generate a humoral and/or cellular immune response), use in<br>
diagnostics (e.g, bound by suitable antibodies for use in ELISAs or other<br>
immunoassays) and/or polypeptides which exhibit one or more biological activities<br>
associated with the wild type or synthetic HIV polypeptide. For example, as used<br>
herein, the term "Gag polypeptide" may refer to a polypeptide that is bound by one or<br>
more anti-Gag antibodies; elicits a humoral and/or cellular immune response; and/or<br>
exhibits the ability to form particles.<br>
The term "HIV polypeptide" refers to any amino acid sequence that exhibits<br>
sequence homology to native HIV polypeptides (e.g., Gag, Env, Prot, Pol, RT, Int, vif,<br>
vpr, vpu, tat, rev, nef and/or combinations thereof) and/or which is functional. Non-<br>
limiting examples of functions that may be exhibited by HIV polypeptides include, use<br>
as immunogens (e.g., to generate a humoral and/or cellular immune response), use in<br>
diagnostics (e.g, bound by suitable antibodies for use in ELISAs or other<br>
tmmunoassays) and/or polypeptides which exhibit one or more biological activities<br>
associated with the wild type or synthetic HIV polypeptide. For example, as used<br>
herein, the term "Gag polypeptide" may refer to a polypeptide that is bound by one or<br>
more anti-Gag antibodies; elicits a humoral and/or cellular immune response; and/or<br>
exhibits the ability to form particles.<br>
An "antigen" refers to a molecule containing one or more epitopes (either<br>
linear, conformational or both) that will stimulate a host's immune system to make a<br>
humoral and/or cellular antigen-specific response. The term is used interchangeably<br>
with the term "immunogen." Normally, a B-cell epitope will include at least about 5<br>
amino acids but can be as small as 3-4 amino acids. A T-cell epitope, such as a CTL<br>
epitope, will include at least about 7-9 amino acids, and a helper T-cell epitope at least<br>
about 12-20 amino acids. Normally, an epitope will include between about 7 and 15<br>
amino acids, such as, 9, 10, 12 or 15 amino acids. The term "antigen" denotes both<br>
subunit antigens, (i.e., antigens which are separate and discrete from a whole organism<br>
with which the antigen is associated in nature), as well as, killed, attenuated or<br>
inactivated bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites or other microbes. Antibodies such as<br>
anti-idiotype antibodies, or fragments thereof, and synthetic peptide mimotopes, which<br>
can mimic an antigen or antigenic determinant, are also captured under the definition<br>
of antigen as used herein. Similarly, an oligonucleotide or polynucleotide which<br>
expresses an antigen or antigenic determinant in vivo, such as in gene therapy and<br>
DNA immunization applications, is also included in the definition of antigen herein.<br>
For purposes of the present invention, antigens can be derived from any of<br>
several known viruses, bacteria, parasites and fungi, as described more fully below.<br>
The term also intends any of the various tumor antigens. Furthermore, for purposes of<br>
the present invention, an "antigen" refers to a protein which includes modifications,<br>
such as deletions, additions and substitutions (generally conservative in nature), to the<br>
native sequence, so long as the protein maintains the ability to elicit an immunologieal<br>
response, as defined herein. These modifications may be deliberate, as through site-<br>
directed mutagenesis, or may be accidental, such as through mutations of hosts which<br>
produce the antigens.<br>
An "immunological response" to an antigen or composition is the development<br>
in a subject of a humoral and/or a cellular immune response to an antigen present in the<br>
composition of interest. For purposes of the present invention, a "humoral immune<br>
response" refers to an immune response mediated by antibody molecules, while a<br>
"cellular immune response" is one mediated by T-lymphocytes and/or other white<br>
blood cells. One important aspect of cellular immunity involves an antigen-specific<br>
response by cytolytic T-cells ("CTL"s). CTLs have specificity for peptide antigens<br>
that are presented in association with proteins encoded by the major histocompatibility<br>
complex (MHC) and expressed on the surfaces of cells. CTLs help induce and<br>
promote the destruction of intracellular microbes, or the lysis of cells infected with<br>
such microbes. Another aspect of cellular immunity involves an antigen-specific<br>
response by helper T-cells. Helper T-cells act to help stimulate the function, and focus<br>
the activity of, nonspecific effector cells against cells displaying peptide antigens in<br>
association with MHC molecules on their surface. A "cellular immune response" also<br>
refers to the production of cytokines, chemokines and other such molecules produced<br>
by activated T-cells and/or other white blood cells, including those derived from CD4+<br>
and CD8+T-cells.<br>
A composition or vaccine that elicits a cellular immune response may serve to<br>
sensitize a vertebrate subject by the presentation of antigen in association with MHC<br>
molecules at the cell surface. The cell-mediated immune response is directed at, or<br>
near, cells presenting antigen at their surface. In addition, antigen-specific T-<br>
lymphocytes can be generated to allow for the future protection of an immunized host.<br>
The ability of a particular antigen to stimulate a cell-mediated immunological<br>
response may be determined by a number of assays, such as by lymphoproliferation<br>
(lymphocyte activation) assays, CTL cytotoxic cell assays, or by assaying for T-<br>
lymphocytes specific for the antigen in a sensitized subject. Such assays are well<br>
known in the art. See, eg., Erickson et al., J. Immunol. (1993) 151:4189-4199; Doe<br>
et aL, Eur. J. Immunol (1994) 24:2369-2376. Recent methods of measuring cell-<br>
mediated immune response include measurement of intracellular cytokines or cytokine<br>
secretion by T-cefl populations, or by measurement of epitope specific T-cells (e.g., by<br>
the tetramer techniqueXreviewed by McMichael, A.J., and O'Callaghan, C.A., J.. Exp.<br>
Med. 187(9)1367-1371,1998; Mcheyzer-Williams, M.G., et al, Immunol Rev. 150:5-<br>
21, 1996; Lalvara, A., et al, J. Exp, Med. 186:859-865,1997).<br>
Thus, an immunological response as used herein may be one which stimulates<br>
the production of CTLs, and/or the production or activation of helper T- cells. The<br>
antigen of interest may also elicit an antibody-mediated immune response. Hence, an<br>
immunological response may include one or more of the following effects: the<br>
production of antibodies by B-cell; and/or the activation of suppressor T-cells and/or<br>
?d T-cells directed specifically to an antigen or antigens present in the composition or<br>
vaccine of interest. These responses may serve to neutralize infectivity, and/or mediate<br>
antibody-complement, or antibody dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) to provide<br>
protection to an immunized host. Such responses can be determined using standard<br>
immunoassays and neutralization assays, well known in the art.<br>
An "immunogenic composition" is a composition that comprises an antigenic<br>
molecule where administration of the composition to a subject results in the<br>
development in the subject of a humoral and/or a cellular immune response to the<br>
antigenic molecule of interest. The immunogenic composition can be introduced<br>
directly into a recipient subject, such as by injection, inhalation, oral, intranasal and<br>
mucosal (e.g., intra-rectally or intra-vaginally) administration.<br>
By "subunit vaccine" is meant a vaccine composition which includes one or<br>
more selected antigens but not all antigens, derived from or homologous to, an antigen<br>
from a pathogen of interest such as from a virus, bacterium, parasite or fungus. Such a<br>
composition is substantially free of intact pathogen cells or pathogenic particles, or the<br>
lysate of such cells or particles. Thus, a "subunit vaccine" can be prepared from at<br>
least partially purified (preferably substantially purified) immunogenic polypeptides<br>
from the pathogen, or analogs thereof. The method of obtaining an antigen included in<br>
the subunit vaccine can thus include standard purification techniques, recombinant<br>
production, or synthetic production.<br>
"Substantially purified" general refers to isolation of a substance (compound,<br>
polynucleotide, protein, polypeptide, polypeptide composition) such that the substance<br>
comprises the majority percent of the sample in which it resides. Typically in a sample<br>
a substantially purified component comprises 50%, preferably 80%-85%, more<br>
preferably 90-95% of the sample. Techniques for purifying polynucteotides and<br>
polypeptides of interest are well-known in the art and include, for example, ion-<br>
exchange chromatograplly, affinity chromatography and sedimentation according to<br>
density.<br>
A "coding sequence" or a sequence which "encodes" a selected polypeptide, is<br>
a nucleic acid molecule which is transcribed (in the case of DNA) and translated (in the<br>
case of mRNA) into a polypeptide in vivo when placed under the control of<br>
appropriate regulatory sequences (or "control elements"). The boundaries of the<br>
coding sequence are determined by a start codon at the 5' (amino) terminus and a<br>
translation stop codon at the 3' (carboxy) terminus. A coding sequence can include,<br>
but is not limited to, cDNA from viral, procaryotic or eucaryotic mRNA, genomic<br>
DNA sequences from viral or procaryotic DNA, and even synthetic DNA sequences.<br>
A transcription termination sequence such as a stop codon may be located 3' to the<br>
coding sequence.<br>
Typical "control elements", include, but are not limited to, transcription<br>
promoters, transcription enhancer elements, transcription termination signals,<br>
polyadenylation sequences (located 3' to the translation stop codon), sequences for<br>
optimization of initiation of translation (located 5' to the coding sequence), and<br>
translation termination sequences. For example, the sequences and/or vectors<br>
described herein may also include one or more additional sequences that may optimize<br>
translation and/or termination including, but not limited to, a Kozak sequence (e.g.,<br>
GCCACC placed in front (5') of the ATG of the codon-optimized wild-type leader or<br>
any other suitable leader sequence (e.g., tpal, tpa2, wtLnat (native wild-type leader))<br>
or a termination sequence (e.g., TAA or, preferably, TAAA placed after (3') the<br>
coding sequence.<br>
A "polynucleotide coding sequence" or a sequence which "encodes" a selected<br>
polypeptide, is a nucleic acid molecule which is transcribed (in the case of DNA) and<br>
translated (in the case of mRNA) into a polypeptide in vivo when placed under the<br>
control of appropriate regulatory sequences (or "control elements"). The boundaries<br>
of the coding sequence are determined by a start codon, for example, at or near the 5'<br>
terminus and a translation stop codon, for example, at or near the 3' terminus.<br>
Exemplary coding sequences are the modified viral polypeptkle-coding sequences of<br>
the present invention. The coding regions of the polynucleotide sequences of the<br>
present invention are identifiable by one of skin in the art and may, for example, be<br>
easily identified by performing translations of all three frames of the polynucleotide and<br>
identifying the frame corresponding to the encoded polypeptide, for example, a<br>
synthetic nef polynucleotide of the present invention encodes a nef-derived<br>
polypeptide. A transcription termination sequence may be located 3' to the coding<br>
sequence. Typical "control elements", include, but are not limited to, transcription<br>
regulators, such as promoters, transcription enhancer elements, transcription<br>
termination signals, and polyadenylation sequences; and translation regulators, such as<br>
sequences for optimization of initiation of translation, e.g., Shine-Dalgarno (ribosome<br>
binding site) sequences, Kozak sequences (i.e., sequences for the optimization of<br>
translation, located, for example, 5' to the coding sequence), leader sequences,<br>
translation initiation codon (e.g., ATG), and translation termination sequences. In<br>
certain embodiments, one or more translation regulation or initiation sequences (e.g.,<br>
the leader sequence) are derived from wild-type translation initiation sequences, i.e.,<br>
sequences that regulate translation of the coding region in their native state. Wild-type<br>
leader sequences that have been modified, using the methods described herein, also<br>
find use in the present invention. Promoters can include inducible promoters (where<br>
expression of a polynucleotide sequence operably linked to the promoter is induced by<br>
an analyte, cofactor, regulatory protein, etc.), repressible promoters (where expression<br>
of a polynucleotide sequence operably linked to the promoter is induced by an analyte,<br>
cofactor, regulatory protein, etc.), and constitutive promoters.<br>
A "nucleic acid" molecule can include, but is not limited to, procaryotic<br>
sequences, eucaryotic mRNA, cDNA from eucaryotic mRNA, genomic DNA<br>
sequences from eucaryotic (e.g., mammalian) DNA, and even synthetic DNA<br>
sequences. The term also captures sequences that include any of the known base<br>
analogs of DNA and RNA.<br>
"Operably linked" refers to an arrangement of elements wherein the<br>
components so described are configured so as to perform their usual function. Thus, a<br>
given promoter operably linked to a coding sequence is capable of effecting the<br>
expression of the coding sequence when the proper enzymes are present. The<br>
promoter need not be contiguous with the coding sequence, so long as it functions to<br>
direct the expression thereof. Thus, for example, intervening untranslated yet<br>
transcribed sequences can be present between the promoter sequence and the coding<br>
sequence and the promoter sequence can still be considered "operably linked" to the<br>
coding sequence.<br>
"Recombinant" as used herein to describe a nucleic acid molecule means a<br>
polynucleotide of genomic, cDNA, semisynthetic, or synthetic origin which, by virtue<br>
of its origin or manipulation: (1) is not associated with all or a portion of the<br>
polynucleotide with which it is associated in nature; and/or (2) is linked to a<br>
polynucleotide other than that to which it is linked in nature. The term "recombinant"<br>
as used with respect to a protein or polypeptide means a polypeptide produced by<br>
expression of a recombinant polynucleotide. "Recombinant host cells," "host cells,"<br>
"cells," "cell lines," "cell cultures," and other such terms denoting procaryotic<br>
microorganisms or eucaryotic cell lines cultured as unicellular entities, are used inter-<br>
changeably, and refer to cells which can be, or have been, used as recipients for<br>
recombinant vectors or other transfer DNA, and include the progeny of the original<br>
cell which has been transfected. It is understood that the progeny of a single parental<br>
cell may not necessarily be completely identical in morphology or in genomic or total<br>
DNA complement to the original parent, due to accidental or deliberate mutation.<br>
Progeny of the parental cell which are sufficiently similar to the parent to be<br>
characterized by the relevant property, such as the presence of a nucleotide sequence<br>
encoding a desired peptide, are included in the progeny intended by this definition, and<br>
are covered by the above terms.<br>
Techniques for determining amino acid sequence "similarity" are well known in<br>
the art. In general, "similarity" means the exact amino acid to amino acid comparison<br>
of two or more polypeptides at the appropriate place, where amino acids are identical<br>
or possess similar chemical and/or physical properties such as charge or<br>
hydrophobicity. A so-termed "percent similarity" then can be determined between the<br>
compared polypeptide sequences. Techniques for determining nucleic acid and amino<br>
acid sequence identity also are well known in the art and include determining the<br>
nucleotide sequence of the mRNA for that gene (usually via a cDNA intermediate) and<br>
determining the amino acid sequence encoded thereby, and comparing this to a second<br>
amino acid sequence. In general, "identity" refers to an exact nucleotide to nucleotide<br>
or amino acid to amino acid correspondence of two polynucleotides or polypeptide<br>
sequences, respectively.<br>
Two or more polynucleotide sequences can be compared by determining their<br>
"percent identity." Two or more amino acid sequences likewise can be compared by<br>
determining their "percent identity." The percent identity of two sequences, whether<br>
nucleic acid or peptide sequences, is generally described as the number of exact<br>
matches between two aligned sequences divided by the length of the shorter sequence<br>
and multiplied by 100. An approximate alignment for nucleic acid sequences is<br>
provided by the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman, Advances in<br>
Applied Mathematics 2:482-489 (1981). This algorithm can be extended to use with<br>
peptide sequences using the scoring matrix developed by Dayhoff, Atlas of Protein<br>
Sequences and Structure, M.O. Dayhoff ed., 5 suppl. 3:353-358, National Biomedical<br>
Research Foundation, Washington, D.C., USA, and normalized by Gribskov, Nucl.<br>
Acids Res. 14(6):6745-6763 (1986). An implementation of this algorithm for nucleic<br>
acid and peptide sequences is provided by the Genetics Computer Group (Madison,<br>
WI) in their BestFit utility application. The default parameters for this method are<br>
described in the Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package Program Manual, Version 8<br>
(1995) (available from Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI). Other equally<br>
suitable programs for calculating the percent identity or similarity between sequences<br>
are generally known in the art.<br>
For example, percent identity of a particular nucleotide sequence to a reference<br>
sequence can be determined using the homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman<br>
with a default scoring table and a gap penalty of six nucleotide positions. Another<br>
method of establishing percent identity in the context of the present invention is to use<br>
the MPSRCH package of programs copyrighted by the University of Edinburgh,<br>
developed by John F. Collins and Shane S. Sturrok, and distributed by IntelliGenetics,<br>
Inc. (Mountain View, CA). From this suite of packages, the Smith-Waterman<br>
algorithm can be employed where default parameters are used for the scoring table (for<br>
example, gap open penalty of 12, gap extension penalty of one, and a gap of six).<br>
From the data generated, the 'Match" value reflects "sequence identity." Other<br>
suitable programs for calculating the percent identity or similarity between sequences<br>
are generally known in the art, such as the alignment program BLAST, which can also<br>
be used with default parameters. For example, BLASTN and BLASTP can be used<br>
with the following default parameters: genetic code = standard; filter = none; strand =<br>
both; cutoff = 60; expect = 10; Matrix = BLOSUM62; Descriptions = 50 sequences;<br>
sort by = HIGH SCORE; Databases = non-redundant, GenBank + EMBL + DDBJ +<br>
PDB + GenBank CDS translations + Swiss protein + Spupdate + PER. Details of these<br>
programs can be found at the following internet address: http://www.ncbi.nlm.gov/cgi-bin/BLAST<br>
One of skill in the art can readily determine the proper search parameters to use<br>
for a given sequence, exemplary preferred Smith Waterman based parameters are<br>
presented above. For example, the search parameters may vary based on the size of<br>
the sequence in question. Thus, for the polynucleotide sequences of the present<br>
invention the length of the polynucleotide sequence disclosed herein is searched against<br>
a selected database and compared to sequences of essentially the same length to<br>
determine percent identity. For example, a representative embodiment of the present<br>
invention would include an isolated polynucleotide comprising X contiguous<br>
nucleotides, wherein (i) the X contiguous nucleotides have at least about a selected<br>
level of percent identity relative to Y contiguous nucleotides of one or more of the<br>
sequences described herein (e.g., in Table C) or fragment thereof, and (ii) for search<br>
purposes X equals Y, wherein Y is a selected reference polynucleotide of defined<br>
length (for example, a length of from 15 nucleotides up to the number of nucleotides<br>
present in a selected full-length sequence).<br>
The sequences of the present invention can include fragments of the sequences,<br>
for example, from about 15 nucleotides up to the number of nucleotides present in the<br>
full-length sequences described herein (e.g., see the Figures), including all integer<br>
values falling within the above-described range. For example, fragments of the<br>
polynucleotide sequences of the present invention may be 30-60 nucleotides, 60-120<br>
nucleotides, 120-240 nucleotides, 240-480 nucleotides, 480-1000 nucleotides, and all<br>
integer values therebetween.<br>
The synthetic expression cassettes (and purified polynucleotides) of the present<br>
invention include related polynucleotide sequences having about 80% to 100%, greater<br>
than 80-85%, preferably greater than 90-92%, more preferably greater than 95%, and<br>
most preferably greater man 98% up to 100% (including all integer values felling<br>
within these described ranges) sequence identity to the synthetic expression cassette<br>
and/or polynucleotide sequences disclosed herein (for example, to the sequences of<br>
the present invention) when the sequences of the present invention are used as the<br>
query sequence against, for example, a database of sequences.<br>
Two nucleic acid fragments are considered to "selectively hybridize" as<br>
described herein. The degree of sequence identity between two nucleic acid molecules<br>
affects the efficiency and strength of hybridization events between such molecules. A<br>
partially identical nucleic acid sequence will at least partially inhibit a completely<br>
identical sequence from hybridizing to a target molecule. Inhibition of hybridization of<br>
the completely identical sequence can be assessed using hybridization assays that are<br>
well known in the art (e.g., Southern blot, Northern blot, solution hybridization, or the<br>
like, see Sambrook, et al., supra or Ausubel et al., supra). Such assays can be<br>
conducted using varying degrees of selectivity, for example, using conditions varying<br>
from low to high stringency. If conditions of low stringency are employed, the<br>
absence of non-specific binding can be assessed using a secondary probe that lacks<br>
even a partial degree of sequence identity (for example, a probe having less than about<br>
30% sequence identity with the target molecule), such that, in the absence of non-<br>
specific binding events, the secondary probe will not hybridize to the target.<br>
When utilizing a hybridization-based detection system, a nucleic acid probe is<br>
chosen that is complementary to a target nucleic acid sequence, and then by selection<br>
of appropriate conditions the probe and the target sequence "selectively hybridize," or<br>
bind, to each other to form a hybrid molecule. A nucleic acid molecule that is capable<br>
of hybridizing selectively to a target sequence under "moderately stringent" typically<br>
hybridizes under conditions that allow detection of a target nucleic acid sequence of at<br>
least about 10-14 nucleotides in length having at least approximately 70% sequence<br>
identity with the sequence of the selected nucleic acid probe. Stringent hybridization<br>
conditions typically allow detection of target nucleic acid sequences of at least about<br>
10-14 nucleotides in length having a sequence identity of greater than about 90-95%<br>
with the sequence of the selected nucleic acid probe. Hybridization conditions useful<br>
for probe/target hybridization where the probe and target have a specific degree of<br>
sequence identity, can be determined as is known in the art (see, for example, Nucleic<br>
Acid Hybridization: A Practical Approach, editors B.D. Hames and S.J. Higgins,<br>
(1985) Oxford; Washington, DC; IRL Press).<br>
With respect to stringency conditions for hybridization, it is well known in the<br>
art that numerous equivalent conditions can be employed to establish a particular<br>
stringency by varying, for example, the following factors: the length and nature of<br>
probe and target sequences, base composition of the various sequences, concentrations<br>
of salts and other hybridization solution components, the presence or absence of<br>
blocking agents in the hybridization solutions (e.g., formamide, dextran sulfate, and<br>
polyethylene glycol), hybridization reaction temperature and time parameters, as well<br>
as, varying wash conditions. The selection of a particular set of hybridization<br>
conditions is selected following standard methods in the art (see, for example,<br>
Sambrook, et al., supra or Ausubel et al., supra).<br>
A first polynucleotide is "derived from" second polynucleotide if it has the<br>
same or substantially the same basepair sequence as a region of the second<br>
polynucleotide, its cDNA, complements thereof, or if it displays sequence identity as<br>
described above.<br>
A first polypeptide is "derived from" a second polypeptide if it is (i) encoded by<br>
a first polynucleotide derived from a second polynucleotide, or (ii) displays sequence<br>
identity to the second polypeptides as described above.<br>
Generally, a viral polypeptide is "derived from" a particular polypeptide of a<br>
virus (viral polypeptide) if it is (i) encoded by an open reading frame of a<br>
polynucleotide of that virus (viral polynucleotide), or (ii) displays sequence identity to<br>
polypeptides of that virus as described above.<br>
"Encoded by" refers to a nucleic acid sequence which codes for a polypeptide<br>
sequence, wherein the polypeptide sequence or a portion thereof contains an ammo<br>
acid sequence of at least 3 to 5 amino acids, more preferably at least 8 to 10 amino<br>
acids, and even more preferably at least 15 to 20 amino acids from a polypeptide<br>
encoded by the nucleic acid sequence. Also encompassed are polypeptide sequences<br>
which are immunologically identifiable with a polypeptide encoded by the sequence.<br>
Further, polyproteins can be constructed by fusing in-frame two or more<br>
polynucleotide sequences encoding polypeptide or peptide products. Further,<br>
polycistronic coding sequences may be produced by placing two or more<br>
polynucleotide sequences encoding polypeptide products adjacent each other, typically<br>
under the control of one promoter, wherein each polypeptide coding sequence may be<br>
modified to include sequences for internal ribosome binding sites.<br>
"Purified polynucleotide" refers to a polynucleotide of interest or fragment<br>
thereof which is essentially free, e.g., contains less than about 50%, preferably less<br>
than about 70%, and more preferably less than about 90%, of the protein with which<br>
the polynucleotide is naturally associated. Techniques for purifying polynucleotides of<br>
interest are well-known in the art and include, for example, disruption of the cell<br>
containing the polynucleotide with a chaotropic agent and separation of the<br>
polynucleotide(s) and proteins by ion-exchange chromatography, affinity<br>
chromatography and sedimentation according to density.<br>
By "nucleic acid immunization" is meant the introduction of a nucleic acid<br>
molecule encoding one or more selected antigens into a host cell, for the ire vivo<br>
expression of an antigen, antigens, an epitope, or epitopes. The nucleic acid molecule<br>
can be introduced directly into a recipient subject, such as by injection, inhalation, oral,<br>
intranasal and mucosal administration, or the like, or can be introduced ex vivo, into<br>
cells which have been removed from the host. In the latter case, the transformed cells<br>
are reintroduced into the subject where an immune response can be mounted against<br>
the antigen encoded by the nucleic acid molecule.<br>
"Gene transfer" or "gene delivery" refers to methods or systems for reliably<br>
inserting DNA of interest into a host cell. Such methods can result in transient<br>
expression of non-integrated transferred DNA, extrachromosomal replication and<br>
expression of transferred replicons (e.g., episomes), or integration of transferred<br>
genetic material into the genomic DNA of host cells. Gene delivery expression vectors<br>
include, but are not limited to, vectors derived from alphaviruses, pox viruses and<br>
vaccinia viruses. When used for immunization, such gene delivery expression vectors<br>
may be referred to as vaccines or vaccine vectors.<br>
"T lymphocytes" or T cells" are non-antibody producing lymphocytes that<br>
constitute a part of the cell-mediated arm of the immune system. T cells arise from<br>
immature lymphocytes that migrate from the bone marrow to the thymus, where they<br>
undergo a maturation process under the direction of thymic hormones. Here, the<br>
mature lymphocytes rapidly divide increasing to very large numbers. The maturing T<br>
cells become immunocompetent based on their ability to recognize and bind a specific<br>
antigen. Activation of immunocompetent T cells is triggered when an antigen binds to<br>
the lymphocyte's surface receptors.<br>
The term "transfection" is used to refer to the uptake of foreign DNA by a cell.<br>
A cell has been "transfected" when exogenous DNA has been introduced inside the cell<br>
membrane. A number of transfection techniques are generally known in the art. See,<br>
e.g., Graham et al. (1973) Virology, 52:456, Sambrook et al. (1989) Molecular<br>
Cloning, a laboratory maraud, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, New York, Davis et<br>
al. (1986) Basic Methods in Molecular Biology, Elsevier, and Chu et al. (1981) Gene<br>
13:197. Such techniques can be used to introduce one or more exogenous DNA<br>
moieties into suitable host cells. The term refers to both stable and transient uptake of<br>
the genetic material, and includes uptake of peptide- or antibody-linked DNAs.<br>
A "vector" is capable of transferring gene sequences to target cells (e.g., viral<br>
vectors, non-viral vectors, particulate carriers, and liposomes). Typically, "vector<br>
construct," "expression vector," and "gene transfer vector," mean any nucleic acid<br>
construct capable of directing the expression of a gene of interest and which can<br>
transfer gene sequences to target cells. Thus, the term includes cloning and expression<br>
vehicles, as well as viral vectors.<br>
Transfer of a "suicide gene" (e.g., a drug-susceptibility gene) to a target cell<br>
renders the cell sensitive to compounds or compositions that are relatively nontoxic to<br>
normal cells. Moolten, RL. (1994) Cancer Gene Ther. 1:279-287. Examples of<br>
suicide genes are thymidine kinase of herpes simplex virus (HSV-tk), cytochrome<br>
P450 (Manome et al., (1996) Gene Therapy 1:513-520), human deoxycytidine kinase<br>
(Manome et al., (1996) Nature Medicine 2(5):567-573) and the bacterial enzyme<br>
cytosine deaminase (Dong et al. (1996) Human Gene Therapy 7:713-720). Cells<br>
which express these genes are rendered sensitive to the effects of the relatively<br>
nontoxic prodrugs ganciclovir (HSV-tk), cyclophosphamide (cytochrome P450 2B1),<br>
cytosine arabinoside (human deoxycytidine kinase) or 5-fluorocytosine (bacterial<br>
cytosine deaminase). Culver et al., (1992) Science 256: 1550-1552, Huberet al. (1994)<br>
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 21:8302-8306.<br>
A "selectable marker" or "reporter marker" refers to a nucleotide sequence<br>
included in a gene transfer vector that has no therapeutic activity, but rather is included<br>
to allow for simpler preparation, manufacturing, characterization or testing of the gene<br>
transfer vector.<br>
A "specific binding agent" refers to a member of a specific binding pair of<br>
molecules wherein one of the molecules specifically binds to the second molecule<br>
through chemical and/or physical means. One example of a specific binding agent is an<br>
antibody directed against a selected antigen.<br>
By "subject" is meant any member of the subphylum chordata, including,<br>
without limitation, humans and other primates, including non-human primates such as<br>
rhesus macaque, chimpanzees and other apes and monkey species; farm animals such<br>
as cattle, sheep, pigs, goats and horses; domestic mammals such as dogs and cats;<br>
laboratory animals including rodents such as mice, rats and guinea pigs; birds,<br>
including domestic, wild and game birds such as chickens, turkeys and other<br>
gallinaceous birds, ducks, geese, and the like. The term does not denote a particular<br>
age. Thus, both adult and newborn individuals are intended to be covered. The<br>
system described above is intended for use in any of the above vertebrate species, since<br>
the immune systems of all of these vertebrates operate similarly.<br>
By "pharmaceutically acceptable" or "pharmacologically acceptable" is meant a<br>
material which is not biologically or otherwise undesirable, i.e., the material may be<br>
administered to an individual in a formulation or composition without causing any<br>
undesirable biological effects or interacting in a deleterious manner with any of the<br>
components of the composition in which it is contained.<br>
By "physiological pH" or a "pH in the physiological range" is meant a pH in<br>
the range of approximately 7.0 to 8.0 inclusive, more typically in the range of<br>
approximately 7.2 to 7.6 inclusive.<br>
As used herein, "treatment" refers to any of (i) the prevention of infection or<br>
reinfection, as in a traditional vaccine, (ii) the reduction or elimination of symptoms,<br>
and (iii) the substantial or complete elimination of the pathogen in question. Treatment<br>
may be effected prophylactically (prior to infection) or therapeutically (following<br>
infection).<br>
By "co-administration" is meant administration of more than one composition<br>
or molecule. Thus, co-administration includes concurrent administration or<br>
sequentially administration (in any order), via the same or different routes of<br>
administration. Non-limiting examples of co-administration regimes include, co-<br>
administration of nucleic acid and polypeptide; co-administration of different nucleic<br>
acids (e.g., different expression cassettes as described herein and/or different gene<br>
delivery vectors); and co-administration of different polypeptides (e.g., different HIV<br>
polypeptides and/or different adjuvants). The term also encompasses multiple<br>
administrations of one of the co-administered molecules or compositions (e.g., multiple<br>
administrations of one or more of the expression cassettes described herein followed<br>
by one or more administrations of a polypeptide-containing composition). In cases<br>
where the molecules or compositions are delivered sequentially, the time between each<br>
administration can be readily determined by one of skill in the art in view of the<br>
teachings herein.<br>
"Lentiviral vector", and "recombinant lentiviral vector" refer to a nucleic acid<br>
construct which carries, and within certain embodiments, is capable of directing the<br>
expression of a nucleic acid molecule of interest. The lentiviral vector include at least<br>
one transcriptional promoter/enhancer or locus defining element(s), or other elements<br>
which control gene expression by other means such as alternate splicing, nuclear RNA<br>
export, post-translational modification of messenger, or post-transcriptional<br>
modification of protein. Such vector constructs must also include a packaging signal,<br>
long terminal repeats (LTRS) or portion thereof, and positive and negative strand<br>
primer binding sites appropriate to the retro virus used (if these are not already present<br>
in the retroviral vector). Optionally, the recombinant lentiviral vector may also include<br>
a signal which directs polyadenylation, selectable markers such as Neo, TK,<br>
hygromycin, phleomycin, histidinol, or DHFR, as well as one or more restriction sites<br>
and a translation termination sequence. By way of example, such vectors typically<br>
include a 5' LTR, a tRNA binding site, a packaging signal, an origin of second strand<br>
DNA synthesis, and a 3"LTR or a portion thereof<br>
"Lentiviral vector particle" as utilized within the present invention refers to a<br>
lentivirus which carries at feast one gene of interest. The retrovirus may also contain a<br>
selectable marker. The recombinant lentivirus is capable of reverse transcribing its<br>
genetic material (RNA) into DNA and incorporating this genetic material into a host<br>
cell's DNA upon infection. Lentiviral vector particles may have a lentiviral envelope, a<br>
non-lentiviral envelope (e.g., an ampho or VSV-G envelope), or a chimeric envelope.<br>
"Nucleic acid expression vector" or "Expression cassette" refers to an assembly<br>
which is capable of directing the expression of a sequence or gene of interest. The<br>
nucleic acid expression vector includes a promoter which is operably linked to the<br>
. sequences or gene(s) of interest. Other control elements may be present as well.<br>
Expression cassettes described herein may be contained within a plasmid construct. In<br>
addition to the components of the expression cassette, the plasmid construct may also<br>
include a bacterial origin of replication, one or more selectable markers, a signal which<br>
allows the plasmid construct to exist as single-stranded DNA (e.g., a M13 origin of<br>
replication), a multiple cloning site, and a "mammalian" origin of replication (e.g., a<br>
SV40 or adenovirus origin of replication).<br>
'Packaging cell" refers to a cell which contains those elements necessary for<br>
production of infectious recombinant retrovirus which are lacking in a recombinant<br>
retroviral vector. Typically, such packaging cells contain one or more expression<br>
cassettes which are capable of expressing proteins which encode Gag, pol and env<br>
proteins.<br>
"Producer cell" or "vector producing cell" refers to a cell which contains all<br>
elements necessary for production of recombinant retroviral vector particles.<br>
2. Modes of Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Before describing the present invention in detail, it is to be understood that this<br>
invention is not limited to particular formulations or process parameters as such may,<br>
of course, vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the<br>
purpose of describing particular embodiments of the invention only, and is not intended<br>
to be limiting.<br>
Although a number of methods and materials similar or equivalent to those<br>
described herein can be used in the practice of the present invention, the preferred<br>
materials and methods are described herein.<br>
2.1. The HIV Genome<br>
The HIV genome and various polypeptide-encoding regions are shown in Table<br>
A. The nucleotide positions are given relative to 8_5_TV1_C.ZA (Figure 1; an HIV<br>
Type C isolate). However, it will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art<br>
in view of the teachings of the present disclosure how to determine corresponding<br>
regions in other HIV strains or variants (e.g., isolates HIVm,, HIVSF2, HIV-1SF162<br>
HIV-1SF170, HIVlav, HIVla, HIVmn, HIV-Icm235,, HIV-1us4, other HlV-1 strains from<br>
diverse subtypes(e.g., subtypes, A through G, and O), HIV-2 strains and diverse<br>
subtypes (e.g., HIV-2UC1 and HIV-2uC2), and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV).<br>
(See, e.g., Virology, 3rd Edition (W.K. Joklik ed. 1988); Fundamental Virology, 2nd<br>
Edition (B.N. Fields and D.M. Knipe, eds. 1991); Virology, 3rd Edition (Reids, BN,<br>
DM Knipe, PM Howley, Editors, 1996, Ljppincott-Raven, Philadelphia, PA; for a<br>
description of these and other related viruses), using for example, sequence<br>
comparison programs {e.g., BLAST and others described herein) or identification and<br>
alignment of structural features {e.g., a program such as the "ALB" program described<br>
herein that can identify the various regions).<br>
It will be readily apparent that one of skill in the art can readily align any<br>
sequence to that shown in Table A to determine relative locations of any particular HIV gene. For example, using one of the alignment programs described herein (e.g.,<br>
BLAST), other HIV genomic sequences can be aligned with 8_5_TV1_C.ZA (Table<br>
A) and locations of genes determined. Polypeptide sequences can be similarly aligned.<br>
For example, Figures 2A-2C shows the alignment of Env polypeptide sequences from<br>
various strains, relative to SF-162. As described in detail in co-owned WO/39303,<br>
Env polypeptides (e.g., gpl20, gpl40 and gp160) include a "bridging sheet"<br>
comprised of 4 anti-parallel ß-strands (0-2, 0-3, 0-20 and 0-21) that form a {3-sheet.<br>
Extruding from one pair of the P-strands (0-2 and 0-3) are two loops, V1 and V2. The<br>
[3-2 sheet occurs at approximately amino acid residue 113 (Cys) to amino acid residue<br>
117 (Thr) while 0-3 occurs at approximately amino acid residue 192 (Ser) to amino<br>
acid residue 194 (Be), relative to SF-162. The "V1/V2 region" occurs at<br>
approximately amino acid positions 120 (Cys) to residue 189 (Cys), relative to SF-162.<br>
Extruding from the second pair of ß-strands (ß-20 and ß-21) is a "small-loop"<br>
structure, also referred to herein as "the bridging sheet small loop." The locations of<br>
both the small loop and bridging sheet small loop can be determined relative to HXB-2<br>
following the teachings herein and in WO/39303. Also shown by arrows in Figure<br>
2A-C are approximate sites for deletions sequence from the beta sheet region. The "*"<br>
denotes N-glycosylation sites that can be mutated following the teachings of the<br>
present specification.<br>
2.2.0 Synthetic Expression Cassettes<br>
One aspect of the present invention is the generation of HIV-1 coding<br>
sequences, and related sequences, for example having improved expression relative to<br>
the corresponding wild-type sequences.<br>
12.1 Modification of HIV-1 Nucleic Acid Coding Sequences<br>
One aspect of the present invention is the generation of HIV-1 coding<br>
sequences, and related sequences, having improved expression relative to the<br>
corresponding wild-type sequences.<br>
First, the HIV-1 codon usage pattern was modified so that the resulting nucleic<br>
acid coding sequence was comparable to codon usage found in highly expressed<br>
human genes. The HIV codon usage reflects a high content of the nucleotides A or T<br>
of the codon-triplet. The effect of the HIV-1 codon usage is a high AT content in the<br>
DNA sequence that results in a decreased translation ability and instability of the<br>
mRNA. In comparison, highly expressed human codons prefer the nucleootides G or C.<br>
The HIV coding sequences were modified to be comparable to codon usage found in<br>
highly expressed human genes.<br>
Second, there are inhibitory (or instability) elements (INS) located within the<br>
coding sequences of, for example, the Gag coding sequences. The RRE is a secondary<br>
RNA structure that interacts with the HIV encoded Rev-protein to overcome the<br>
expression down-regulating effects of the INS. To overcome the post-transcriptional<br>
activating mechanisms of RRE and Rev, the instability elements can be inactivated by<br>
introducing multiple point mutations that do not alter the reading frame of the encoded<br>
proteins.<br>
Third, for some genes the coding sequence has been altered such that the<br>
polynucleotide coding sequence encodes a gene product that is inactive or non-<br>
functional (e.g., inactivated polymerase, protease, tat, rev, nef, vif, vpr, and/or vpu<br>
gene products). Example 1 describes some exemplary mutations. Example 8 presents<br>
information concerning functional analysis of mutated Tat, Rev and Nef antigens.<br>
The synthetic coding sequences are assembled by methods known in the art, for<br>
example by companies such as the Midland Certified Reagent Company (Midland,<br>
Texas).<br>
Modification of the Gag poh/peptide coding sequences results in improved<br>
expression relative to the wild-type coding sequences in a number of mammalian cell<br>
lines (as well as other types of cell lines, including, but not limited to, insect cells).<br>
Some exemplary polynucleotide sequences encoding Gag-containing polypeptides are gagCpoIInaTatReVNelopt_B, GagProtInaRTmutTatRevNef.opt_3,<br>
GagTatRevNef.opt_B, GagComplPohnutIhaTatRevNef_C,<br>
GagProtInaRTmutTatRevNef_C, GagRTmutTatRevNef_C, and GagTatRevNef_C.<br>
Similarly, the present invention may also includes synthetic Env-encoding<br>
polynucleotides and modified Env proteins, for example, those described in WO<br>
00/39303, WO 00/39302, WO 00/39304, WO 02/04493.<br>
The codon usage pattern for Env was modified as described above for Gag so<br>
that the resulting nucleic acid coding sequence was comparable to codon usage found<br>
in highly expressed human genes. Experiments performed in support of the present<br>
invention show that the synthetic Env sequences were capable of higher level of<br>
protein production relative to the native Env sequences.<br>
Modification of the Env polypeptide coding sequences results in improved<br>
expression relative to the wild-type coding sequences in a number of mammalian cell<br>
lines (as well as other types of cell lines, including, but not limited to, insect cells).<br>
Similar Env polypeptide coding sequences can be obtained, modified and tested for<br>
improved expression from a variety of isolates, including those described above for<br>
Gag.<br>
Further modifications of Env include, but are not limited to, generating<br>
polynucleotides that encode Env polypeptides having mutations and/or deletions<br>
therein. For instance, the hypervariable regions, V1 and/or V2, can be deleted as<br>
described herein. Additionally, other modifications, for example to the bridging sheet<br>
region and/or to N-glycosylation sites within Env can also be performed following the<br>
teachings of the present specification, (see, Figure2A-C, as well as WO 00/39303,<br>
WO 00/39302, WO 00/39304, WO 02/04493). Various combinations of these<br>
modifications can be employed to generate synthetic expression cassettes as described<br>
herein.<br>
The present invention also includes expression cassettes which include<br>
synthetic Pol sequences. As noted above, "Pol" includes, but is not limited to, the<br>
protein-encoding regions comprising polymerase, protease, reverse transcriptase<br>
and/or integrase-containing sequences (Wan et et al (1996) Biochem. J. 316:569-573;<br>
Kohl et al (1988) PNAS USA 85:4686-4690; Krausstich et al. (1988) J. Virol.<br>
62:4393-4397; Coffin, "Retroviridae and their Replication" in Virology, ppl437-1500<br>
(Raven, New York, 1990); Patel et. al., (1995) Biochemistry 34:5351-5363). Thus, the<br>
synthetic expression cassettes exemplified herein include one or more of these regions<br>
and one or more changes to the resulting amino acid sequences. Some exemplary<br>
polynucleotide sequences encoding Pol-derived polypeptides are presented in Table C.<br>
The codon usage pattern for Pol was modified as described above for Gag and<br>
Env so that the resulting nucleic acid coding sequence was comparable to codon usage<br>
found in highly expressed human genes.<br>
Constructs may be modified in various ways. For example, the expression<br>
constructs may include a sequence that encodes the first 6 amino acids of the integrase<br>
polypeptide. This 6 amino acid region is believed to provide a cleavage recognition<br>
site recognized by HIV protease (see, e.g., McCornack et al. (1997) FEBS Letts<br>
414:84-88). Constructs may include a multiple cloning site (MCS) for insertion of<br>
one or more transgenes, typically at the 31 end of the construct. In addition, a cassette<br>
encoding a catalytic center epitope derived from the catalytic center in RT is typically<br>
included 3' of the sequence encoding 6 amino acids of integrase. This cassette encodes<br>
He 178 through Serine 191 of RT and may be added to keep this well conserved region<br>
as a possible CTL epitope. Further, the constructs contain an insertion mutations to<br>
preserve the reading frame, (see, e.g., Park et al. (1991) J. Virol. 65:5111).<br>
In certain embodiments, the catalytic center and/or primer grip region of RT<br>
are modified. The catalytic center and primer grip regions of RT are described, for<br>
example, in Patel et al. (1995) Biochem. 34:5351 and Palaniappan et al., (1997) J. Biol<br>
Chem. 272(17): 11157. For example, wild type sequence encoding the amino acids<br>
YMDD at positions 183-185 of p66 RT, numbered relative to AF110975, may be<br>
replaced with sequence encoding the amino acids "AP". Further, the primer grip<br>
region (amino acids WMGY, residues 229-232 of p66RT, numbered relative to<br>
AF110975) may be replaced with sequence encoding the amino acids "PL"<br>
For the Pol sequence, the changes in codon usage are typically restricted to the<br>
regions up to the -1 frameshift and starting again at the end of the Gag reading frame;<br>
however, regions within the frameshift translation region can be modified as well<br>
Finally, inhibitory (or instability) elements (INS) located within the coding sequences<br>
of the protease polypeptide coding sequence can be altered as well.<br>
Experiments can be performed in support of the present invention to show that<br>
the synthetic Pol sequences were capable of higher level of protein production relative<br>
to the native Pol sequences. Modification of the Pol polypeptide coding sequences<br>
results in improved expression relative to the wild-type coding sequences in a number<br>
of mammalian cell lines (as well as other types of cell lines, including, but not limited<br>
to, insect cells). Similar Pol polypeptide coding sequences can be obtained, modified<br>
and tested for improved expression from a variety of isolates, including those described<br>
above for Gag and Env.<br>
The present invention also includes expression cassettes which include<br>
synthetic sequences derived HIV genes other than Gag, Env and Pol, including but not<br>
limited to, regions within Gag, Env, Pol, as well as, tat, rev, nef, vif, vpr, and vpu.<br>
Further, the present invention includes synthetic polynucleotides and/or expression<br>
cassettes comprising at least two antigenic polypeptides, wherein the antigenic<br>
peptides are selected from at least two different HIV types, for example, Type A, Type<br>
B, Type C, Type D, Type E, Type F, Type G, Type O, etc. The synthetic<br>
polynucleotide sequences of the present invention (comprising at least one<br>
polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide comprising a Type B antigen and at least one<br>
polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide comprising a Type C antigen) may be, for<br>
example, selected from the following sequences: gagCpolInaTatRevNef.opt_B.<br>

may be used, for example, in their entirety or sequences encoding specific epitopes or<br>
antigens may be selected from the synthetic coding sequences following the teachings<br>
of the present specification and information known in the art. For example, the<br>
polypeptide sequences encoded by the polynucleotides may be subjected to computer<br>
analysis to predict antigenic peptide fragments within the full-length sequences. The<br>
corresponding polynucleotide coding fragments may then be used in the constructs of<br>
the present invention. Exemplary algorithms useful for such analysis include, but are<br>

Default parameters, for the above-recited algorithms, may be used to determine<br>
antigenic sites. Further, the results of two or more of the above analyses may be<br>
combined to identify particularly preferred fragments.<br>
Sequences obtained from other strains can be manipulated in similar fashion<br>
following the teachings of the present specification. As noted above, the codon usage<br>
pattern is modified as described above for Gag, Env and Pol so that the resulting<br>
nucleic acid coding sequence is comparable to codon usage found in highly expressed<br>
human genes. Typically these synthetic sequences are capable of higher level of<br>
protein production relative to the native sequences and that modification of the wild-<br>
type polypeptide coding sequences results in improved expression relative to the wild-<br>
type coding sequences in a number of mammalian cell lines (as well as other types of<br>
cell lines, including, but not limited to, insect cells). Furthermore, the nucleic acid<br>
sequence can also be modified to introduce mutations into one or more regions of the<br>
gene, for instance to alter the function of the gene product (e.g., render the gene<br>
product non-functional) and/or to eliminate site modifications (e.g., the myristoylation<br>
site in Nef).<br>
Synthetic expression cassettes, comprising at least one polynucleotide encoding<br>
a polypeptide comprising a Type B antigen and at least one polynucleotide encoding a<br>
polypeptide comprising a Type C antigen, may be, for example, derived from HIV<br>

2.2,2 Further Modification of Sequences Including HIV Nucleic<br>
Acid Coding Sequences<br>
The HIV polypeptide-encoding expression cassettes described herein may also<br>
contain one or more further sequences encoding, for example, one or more transgenes.<br>
Further sequences (e.g., transgenes) useful in the practice of the present invention<br>
include, but are not limited to, further sequences are those encoding further viral<br>
epitopes/antigens {including but not limited to, HCV antigens (e.g., E1, E2;<br>

be derived from non-viral sources, for instance, sequences encoding cytokines such<br>
interieukin-2 (IL-2), stem cell factor (SCF), interleufcin 3 (IL-3), interleukin 6 (IL-6),<br>
interleukin 12 (IL-12), G-CSF, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor<br>

flt3 ligand, commercially ava2abib from several vendors such as, for example,<br>
Genzyme (Framingham, MA), Genentech (South San Francisco, CA), Amgen<br>
(Thousand Oaks, CA), R&amp;D Systems and Immunex (Seattle, WA). Additional<br>
sequences are described below. Also, variations on the orientation of the Gag and<br>
other coding sequences, relative to each other, are described below.<br>
HIV polypeptide coding sequences can be obtained from other HIV isolates,<br>
see, e.g., Myers et al. Los Alamos Database, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los<br>
Alamos, New Mexico (1992); Myers et aL, Human Retroviruses and Aids, 1997, Los<br>
Alamos, New Mexico: Los Alamos National Laboratory. Synthetic expression<br>
cassettes can be generated using such coding sequences as starting material by<br>
following the teachings of the present specification.<br>
Further, the synthetic expression cassettes of the present invention include<br>
related polypeptide sequences having greater than 85%, preferably greater than 90%,<br>
more preferably greater than 95%, and most preferably greater than 98% sequence<br>
identity to the polypeptides encoded by the synthetic expression cassette sequences<br>
disclosed herein.<br>
Exemplary expression cassettes and modifications are set forth in Example 1.<br>
2,2,3 Expression of Synthetic Sequences Encoding HIV-l<br>
POLYPEPTTDES AND RELATED POLYPEPTIDES<br>
Synthetic HIV-encoding sequences (expression cassettes) of the present<br>
invention can be cloned into a number of different expression vectors to evaluate levels<br>
of expression and, in the case of Gag-containing constructs, production of VLPs. The<br>
synthetic DNA fragments for HIV polypeptides can be cloned into eucaryotic<br>
expression vectors, including, a transient expression vector, CMV-promoter-based<br>
mammalian vectors, and a shuttle vector for use in baculovirus expression systems.<br>
Corresponding wild-type sequences can also be cloned into the same vectors.<br>
These vectors can then be transfected into a several different cell types,<br>
including a variety of mammalian cell lines (293, RD, COS-7, and CHO, cell lines<br>
available, for example, from the A.T.C.C.). The cell lines are then cultured under<br>
appropriate conditions and the levels of any appropriate polypeptide product can be<br>
evaluated in supernatants. (see, Table A). For example, p24 can be used to evaluate<br>
Gag expression; gp160, gp140 or gp120 can be used to evaluate Env expression;<br>
p6pol can be used to evaluate Pol expression; prot can be used to evaluate protease;<br>
p15 for RNAseH; p31 for Integrase; and other appropriate polypeptides for Vif, Vpr,<br>
Tat, Rev, Vpu and Nef. Further, modified polypeptides can also be used, for example,<br>
other Env polypeptides include, but are not limited to, for example, native gp160,<br>
oligomeric gpl40, monomeric gpl20 as well as modified and/or synthetic sequences of<br>
these polypeptides. The results of these assays demonstrate that expression of<br>
synthetic HIV polypeptide-encoding sequences are significantly higher than<br>
corresponding wild-type sequences.<br>
Further, Western Blot analysis can be used to show that cells containing the<br>
synthetic expression cassette produce the expected protein at higher per-cell<br>
concentrations than cells containing the native expression cassette. The HIV proteins<br>
can be seen in both cell lysates and supernatants. The levels of production are<br>
significantly higher in cell supernatants for cells transfected with the synthetic<br>
expression cassettes of the present invention.<br>
Fractionation of the supernatants from mammalian cells transfected with the<br>
synthetic expression cassette can be used to show that the cassettes provide superior<br>
production of HIV proteins and, in the case of Gag, VLPs, relative to the wild-type<br>
sequences.<br>
Efficient expression of these HIV-containing polypeptides in mammalian cell<br>
lines provides the following benefits: the polypeptides are free of baculovirus<br>
contaminants; production by established methods approved by the FDA; increased<br>
purity; greater yields (relative to native coding sequences); and a novel method of<br>
producing the Sub HIV-containing polypeptides in CHO cells which is not feasible in<br>
the absence of the increased expression obtained using the constructs of the present<br>
invention. Exemplary Mammalian cell lines include, but are not limited to, BHK,<br>
VERO, HT1080, 293, 293T, RD,£0S-7, CHO, Jurkat, HUT, SUPT, C8166,<br>
MOLT4/clone8, MT-2, MT-4, H9, PM1, CEM, and CEMX174 (such cell lines are<br>
available, for example, from the A.T.C.C.).<br>
A synthetic Gag expression cassette of the present invention will also exhibit<br>
high levels of expression and VLP production when transfected into insect cells.<br>
Synthetic expression cassettes described herein also demonstrate high levels of<br>
expression in insect cells. Further, in addition to a higher total protein yield, the final<br>
product from the synthetic polypeptides consistently contains lower amounts of<br>
contaminating baculovirus proteins than the final product from the native sequences.<br>
Further, synthetic expression cassettes of the present invention can also be<br>
introduced into yeast vectors which, in turn, can be transformed into and efficiently<br>
expressed by yeast cells (Sacchawmyces cerevisea; using vectors as described in<br>
Rosenberg, S. and Tekamp-Olson, P., U.S. Patent No. RE35.749, issued, March 17,<br>
1998).<br>
In addition to the mammalian and insect vectors, the synthetic expression<br>
cassettes of the present invention can be incorporated into a variety of expression<br>
vectors using selected expression control elements. Appropriate vectors and control<br>
elements for any given cell an be selected by one having ordinary skin in the art in view<br>
of the teachings of the present specification and information known in the art about<br>
expression vectors.<br>
For example, a synthetic expression cassette can be inserted into a vector<br>
which includes control elements operably linked to the desired coding sequence, which<br>
allow for the expression of the gene in a selected cell-type. For example, typical<br>
promoters for mammalian cell expression include the SV40 early promoter, a CMV<br>
promoter such as the CMV immediate early promoter (a CMV promoter can include<br>
intron A), RSV, HIV-Ltr, the mouse mammary tumor virus LTR promoter (MMLV-<br>
ltr), the adenovirus major late promoter (Ad MLP), and the herpes simplex virus<br>
promoter, among others. Other nonviral promoters, such as a promoter derived from<br>
the murine metallothionein gene, will also find use for mammalian expression.<br>
Typically, transcription termination and polyadenylation sequences will also be present,<br>
located 3' to the translation stop codon. Preferably, a sequence for optimization of<br>
initiation of translation, located 5' to the coding sequence, is also present. Examples<br>
of transcription terminator/polyadenylation signals include those derived from S V40,<br>
as described in Sambrook, et al., supra, as well as a bovine growth hormone<br>
terminator sequence. Introns, containing splice donor and acceptor sites, may also be<br>
designed into the constructs for use with the present invention (Chapman et al., Nuc.<br>
Acids Res. (1991) 19:3979-3986).<br>
Enhancer elements may also be used herein to increase expression levels of the<br>
mammalian constructs. Examples include the SV40 early gene enhancer, as described<br>
in Dijkema et al., EMBO J. (1985) 1:761, the enhancer/promoter derived from the<br>
long terminal repeat (LTR) of the Rons Sarcoma Virus, as described in Gorman et aL,<br>
Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA (1982b) 72:6777 and elements derived from human CMV,<br>
as described in Boshart et aL, Cell (1985) 41:521, such as elements included in the<br>
CMV intron A sequence (Chapman et aL, Nuc Acids Res. (1991) 12:3979-3986).<br>
The desired synthetic polypeptide encoding sequences can be cloned into any<br>
number of commercially available vectors to generate expression of the polypeptide in<br>
an appropriate host system. These systems include, but are not limited to, the<br>

Also included in the invention is an expression vector, containing coding<br>
sequences and expression control elements which allow expression of the coding<br>
regions in a suitable host. The control elements generally include a promoter,<br>
translation initiation codon, and translation and transcription termination sequences,<br>
and an insertion site for introducing the insert into the vector. Translational control<br>

Expression in yeast systems has the advantage of commercial production.<br>
Recorabinant protein production by vaccinia and CHO cell line have the advantage of<br>
being mammalian expression systems. Further, vaccinia virus expression has several<br>
advantages including the following: (i) its wide host range; (ii) faithful post-<br>
transcriptional modification, processing, folding, transport, secretion, and assembly of<br>
recombinant proteins; (iii) high level expression of relatively soluble recombinant<br>
proteins; and (iv) a large capacity to accommodate foreign DNA.<br>
The recombinantly expressed polypeptides from synthetic HIV polypeptide-<br>
encoding expression cassettes are typically isolated from lysed cells or culture media.<br>
Purification can be carried oat by methods known in the art including salt<br>
fractionation, ion exchange chromatography, gel filtration, size-exclusion<br>
chromatography, size-fractionation, and affinity chromatography. Immunoaffinity<br>

2.3.0 Production of Virus-like Particles and Use of the<br>
Constructs of the Present Invention to create Packaging<br>
cell lines.<br>
The group-specific antigens (Gag) of human immunodeficiency virus type-1<br>
(HIV-1) self-assemble into noninfectious virus-like particles (VLP) that are released<br>
from various eucaryotic cells by budding (reviewed by Freed, E.O., Virology 251:1-15,<br>
1998). The Gag-containing synthetic expression cassettes of the present invention<br>
provide for the production of HIV-Gag virus-like particles (VLPs) using a variety of<br>
different cell types, including, but not limited to, mammalian cells.<br>
Viral particles can be used as a matrix for the proper presentation of an antigen<br>
entrapped or associated therewith to the immune system of the host.<br>
2.3.1 VLP Production using the synthetic expression cassettes<br>
OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
The Gag-containing synthetic expression cassettes of the present invention may<br>
provide superior production of both Gag proteins and VLPs, relative to native Gag<br>
coding sequences. Further, electron microscopic evaluation of VLP production can be<br>
used to show that free and budding immature virus particles of the expected size are<br>
produced by cells containing the synthetic expression cassettes.<br>
Using the synthetic expression cassettes of the present invention, rather than<br>
native Gag coding sequences, for the production of virus-like particles provide several<br>
advantages. First, VLPs can be produced in enhanced quantity making isolation and<br>
purification of the VLPs easier. Second, VLPs can be produced in a variety of cell<br>
types using the synthetic expression cassettes, in particular, mammalian cell lines can<br>
be used for VLP production, for example, CHO cells. Production using CHO cells<br>
provides (i) VLP formation; (ii) correct myristoylation and budding; (in) absence of<br>
non-Macmillian cell contaminants (e.g., insect viruses and/or cells); and (iv) ease of<br>
purification. The synthetic expression cassettes of the present invention are also useful<br>
for enhanced expression in cell-types other than mammalian cell lines. For example,<br>
infection of insect cells with baculovirus vectors encoding the synthetic expression<br>
cassettes results in higher levels of total Gag protein yield and higher levels of VLP<br>
production (relative to wild-type coding sequences). Further, the final product from<br>
insect cells infected with the baculovirus-Gag synthetic expression cassettes<br>
consistently contains lower amounts<br>
of contaminating insect proteins than the final product when wild-coding sequences are<br>
used.<br>
VLPs can spontaneously form when the particle-forming polypeptide of<br>
interest is recombinantly expressed in an appropriate host cell. Thus, the VLPs<br>
produced using the synthetic expression cassettes of the present invention are<br>
conveniently prepared using recombinant techniques. As discussed below, the Gag<br>
polypeptide encoding synthetic expression cassettes of the present invention can<br>
include other polypeptide coding sequences of interest (for example, HIV protease,<br>
HIV polymerase, Env; synthetic Env). Expression of such synthetic expression<br>
cassettes yields VLPs comprising the Gag polypeptide, as well as, the polypeptide of<br>
interest.<br>
Once coding sequences for the desired particle-forming polypeptides have been<br>
isolated or synthesized, they can be cloned into any suitable vector or replicon for<br>
expression. Numerous cloning vectors are known to those of skill in the art, and the<br>
selection of an appropriate cloning vector is a matter of choice. See, generally,<br>
Sambrook et al, supra. The vector is then used to transform an appropriate host cell.<br>
Suitable recombinant expression systems include, but are not limited to, bacterial,<br>
mammalian, baculovirus/insect, vaccinia, Semliki Forest virus (SFV), Alphaviruses<br>
(such as, Sindbis, Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (VEE)), mammalian, yeast and<br>
Xenopus expression systems, well known in the art. Particularly preferred expression<br>
systems are mammalian cell fines, vaccinia, Sindbis, eucaryotic layered vector initiation<br>
systems (e.g., US Patent No. 6,015,686, US Patent No. 5, 814,482, US Patent No.<br>
6,015,694, US Patent No. 5,789,245, EP 1029068A2, WO 9918226A2/A3, EP<br>
00907746A2, WO 9738087A2), insect and yeast systems.<br>
The synthetic DNA fragments for the expression cassettes of the present<br>
invention, e.g., Pol, Gag, Env, Tat, Rev, Nef, Vif, Vpr, and/or Vpu, may be cloned<br>
into the following eucaryotic expression vectors: pCMVKm2, for transient expression<br>
assays and DNA immunization studies, the pCMVKtn2 vector is derived from<br>
pCMV6a (Chapman et al., Nuc Acids Res. (1991) 12:3979-3986) and comprises a<br>
kanamycin selectable marker, a ColE1 origin of replication, a CMV promoter enhancer<br>
and Intron A, followed by an insertion site for the synthetic sequences described below<br>
followed by a polyadenylation signal derived from bovine growth hormone — the<br>
pCMVKm2 vector differs from the pCMV-link vector only in that a polylinker site is<br>
inserted into pCMVKm2 to generate pCMV-link; pESN2dhfr and pCMVPLEdhfr, for<br>
expression in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells; and, pAcC13, a shuttle vector for<br>
use in the Baculovirus expression system (pAcC13, is derived from pAcC12 which is<br>
described by Munemitsu S., et al., Mol CellBiol. 10(H):5977-5982, 1990).<br>
Briefly, construction of pCMVPLEdhfr was as follows.<br>
To construct a DHFR cassette, the EMCV IRES (internal ribosome entry site)<br>
leader was PCR-amplified from pCite-4a+ (Novagen, Inc., Milwaukee, WI) and<br>
inserted into pET-23d (Novagen, Inc., Milwaukee, WI) as an Xba-Nco fragment to<br>
give pET-EMCV. The dhfr gene was PCR-amplified from pESN2dhfr to give a<br>
product with a Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser spacer in place of the translation stop codon and<br>
inserted as an Nco-BamH1 fragment to give pET-E-DHFR. Next, the attenuated neo<br>
gene was PCR amplified from a pSV2Neo (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) derivative and<br>
inserted into the unique BamH 1 site of pET-E-DHFR to give pET-E-DHFR/Neo(m2).<br>
Finally the bovine growth hormone terminator from pCDNA3 (Invitrogen, Inc.,<br>
Carlsbad, CA) was inserted downstream of the neo gene to give pET-E-<br>
DHFR/Neo(In2)BGHt. The BMCV-dhfrineo selectable marker cassette fragment was<br>
prepared by cleavage of pET-E-DHFR/Neo(m2)BGHt.<br>
In one vector construct the CMV enhancer/promoter plus Intron A was<br>
transferred from pCMV6a (Chapman et aL, Nuc. Acids Res. (1991) 19:3979-3986) as<br>
a HindIII-SalI fragment into pUC19 (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA). The<br>
vector backbone of pUCI9 was deleted from the Ndel to the Sapl sites. The above<br>
described DHFR cassette was added to the construct such that the EMCV IRES<br>
followed the CMV promoter. The vector also contained an amp gene and an SV40<br>
origin of replication.<br>
A number of mammalian cell lines are known in the art and include immortal-<br>
ized cell lines available from the American Type Culture Collection (A.T.C.C.), such<br>
as, but not limited to, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, HeLa cells, baby hamster<br>
kidney (BHK) cells, monkey kidney cells (COS), as well as others. Similarly, bacterial<br>
hosts such as E. coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Streptococcus spp., will find use with the<br>
present expression constructs. Yeast hosts useful in the present invention include inter<br>
alia, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida albicans, Candida maltosa, Hansenula<br>
polymorpha, Kluyveromyces fragilis, Kluyveromyces lactis, Pichia guillerimondii,<br>
Pichia pastoris, Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Ydrrowia lipolytica. Insect cells for<br>
use with baculovirus expression vectors include, inter alia, Aedes aegypti, Autographa<br>
califomica, Bombyx mori, Drosophila melanogaster, Spodopterafrugiperda, and<br>
Trichoplusia ni. See, e.g., Summers and Smith, Texas Agricultural Experiment Station<br>
Bulletin No. 1555(1987).<br>
Viral vectors can be used for the production of particles in eucaryotic cells,<br>
such as those derived from the pox family of viruses, including vaccinia virus and avian<br>
poxvirus. Additionally, a vaccinia based infection/transfection system, as described in<br>
Tomei et al., J. Virol. (1993) 67:4017-4026 and Selby et al., J. Gen. Virol. (1993)<br>
74:1103-1113, will also find use with the present invention. In this system, cells are<br>
first infected in vitro with a vaccinia virus recombinant that encodes the bacteriophage<br>
T7 RNA polymerase. This polymerase displays exquisite specificity in that it only<br>
transcribes templates bearing T7 promoters. Following infection, cells are transfected<br>
with the DNA of interest, driven by a T7 promoter. The polymerase expressed in the<br>
cytoplasm from the vaccinia virus recombinant transcribes the transfected DNA into<br>
RNA which is then translated into protein by the host translational machinery.<br>
Alternately, T7 can be added as a purified protein or enzyme as in the "Progenitor"<br>
system (Studier and Moffatt, J. Mol. Biol (1986) 189:113-130). The method<br>
provides for high level, transient, cytoplasmic production of large quantities of RNA<br>
and its translation product(s).<br>
Depending on the expression system and host selected, the VLPS are produced<br>
by growing host cells transformed by an expression vector under conditions whereby<br>
the particle-forming polypeptide is expressed and VLPs can be formed. The selection<br>
of the appropriate growth conditions is within the skill of the art. If the VLPs are<br>
formed intracellularly, the cells are then disrupted, using chemical, physical or<br>
mechanical means, which lyse the cells yet keep the VLPs substantially intact. Such<br>
methods are known to those of skill in the art and are described in, e.g., Protein<br>
Purification Applications: A Practical Approach, (E.L.V. Harris and S. Angal, Eds.,<br>
1990).<br>
The particles are then isolated (or substantially purified) using methods that<br>
preserve the integrity thereof, such as, by gradient centrifugation, e.g., cesium chloride<br>
(CsCl) sucrose gradients, pelleting and the like (see, e.g., Kirnbauer et al. J. Virol.<br>
(1993) 67:6929-6936), as well as standard purification techniques including, e.g., ion<br>
exchange and gel filtration chromatography.<br>
VLPs produced by cells containing the synthetic expression cassettes of the<br>
present invention can be used to elicit an immune response when administered to a<br>
subject. One advantage of the present invention is that VLPs can be produced by<br>
mammalian cells carrying the synthetic expression cassettes at levels previously not<br>
possible. As discussed above, the VLPs can comprise a variety of antigens in addition<br>
to the Gag polypeptide (e.g., Gag-protease, Gag-polymerase, Env, synthetic Env,<br>
etc.). Purified VLPs, produced using the synthetic expression cassettes of the present<br>
invention, can be administered to a vertebrate subject, usually in the form of vaccine<br>
compositions. Combination vaccines may also be used, where such vaccines contain,<br>
for example, an adjuvant subunit protein (e.g., Env). Administration can take place<br>
using the VLPs formulated alone or formulated with other antigens. Further, the<br>
VLPs can be administered prior to, concurrent with, or subsequent to, delivery of the<br>
synthetic expression cassettes for DNA immunization (see below) and/or delivery of<br>
other vaccines. Also, the site of VLP administration may be the same or different as<br>
other vaccine compositions that are being administered. Gene delivery can be<br>
accomplished by a number of methods including, but are not limited to, immunization<br>
with DNA, alphavirus vectors, pox virus vectors, and vaccinia virus vectors.<br>
VLP immune-stimulating (or vaccine) compositions can include various<br>
excipients, adjuvants, carriers, auxiliary substances, modulating agents, and the like.<br>
The immune stimulating compositions win include an amount of the VLP/antigen<br>
sufficient to mount an immunological response. An appropriate effective amount can<br>
be determined by one of skill in the art. Such an amount will fall in a relatively broad<br>
range that can be determined through routine trials and will generally be an amount on<br>
the order of about 0.1 µg to about 1000 µg, more preferably about 1 µg to about 300<br>
ug, of VLP/antigen.<br>
A carrier is optionally present which is a molecule that does not itself induce<br>
the production of antibodies harmful to the individual receiving the composition.<br>
Suitable carriers are typically large, slowly metabolized macromolecules such as<br>
proteins, polysaccharides, polylactic acids, polyglycollic acids, polymeric amino acids,<br>
amino acid copolymers, lipid aggregates (such as oil droplets or liposomes), and<br>
inactive virus particles. Examples of particulate carriers include those derived from<br>
polymethyl methacrylate polymers, as well as microparticles derived from<br>
poly(lactides) and poly(lactide-co-glycolides), known as PLG. See, e.g., Jeffery et al.,<br>
Pharm. Res. (1993) 10:362-368; McGee JP, et al., J Microencapsul. 14(2): 197-210,<br>
1997; O'Hagan DT, et al.. Vaccine 11(2): 149-54, 1993. Such carriers are well known<br>
to those of ordinary skill in the art. Additionally, these carriers may function as<br>
immunostimulating agents ("adjuvants"). Furthermore, the antigen may be conjugated<br>
to a bacterial toxoid, such as toxoid from diphtheria, tetanus, cholera, etc., as well as<br>
toxins derived from E. coli.<br>
Adjuvants may also be used to enhance the effectiveness of the compositions.<br>
Such adjuvants include, but are not limited to: (1) aluminum salts (alum), such as<br>
aluminum hydroxide, aluminum phosphate, aluminum sulfate, etc.; (2) oil-in-water<br>
emulsion formulations (with or without other specific immunostimulating agents such<br>
as muramyl peptides (see below) or bacterial cell wall components), such as for<br>
example (a) MF59 (International Publication No. WO 90/14837), containing 5%<br>
Squalene, 0.5% Tween 80, and 0.5% Span 85 (optionally containing various amounts<br>
of MTP-PE (see below), although not required) formulated into submicron particles<br>
using a inicrofiuidizer such as Model 110Y microfluidizer (Microfluidics, Newton,<br>
MA), (b) SAP, containing 10% Squalane, 0.4% Tween 80, 5% pluronic-blocked<br>
polymer L121, and thr-MDP (see below) either microfluidized into a submicron<br>
emulsion or vortexed to generate a larger particle size emulsion, and (c) Ribi™<br>
adjuvant system (RAS), (Ribi Immunochem, Hamilton, MT) containing 2% Squalene,<br>
0.2% Tween 80, and one or more bacterial cell wall components from the group<br>
consisting of monophosphorylipid A (MPL), trehalose dimycolate (TDM), and cell<br>
wall skeleton (CWS), preferably MPL + CWS (Detox™); (3) saponin adjuvants, such<br>
as Stimulon™ (Cambridge Bioscience, Worcester, MA) may be used or particle<br>
generated therefrom such as ISCOMs (immunostimulating complexes); (4) Complete<br>
Freunds Adjuvant (GFA) and Incomplete Freunds Adjuvant (IFA); (5) cytokines, such<br>
as interleukins (IL-1, IL-2, etc.), macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF),<br>
tumor necrosis factor (TNF), etc.; (6) oligonucleotides or polymeric molecules<br>
encoding immunostimulatory CpG motifs (Davis, H.L., et al., J. Immunology 160:870-<br>
876, 1998; Sato, Y. et aL, Science 273:352-354, 1996) or complexes of<br>
antigens/oligonucleotides {Polymeric molecules include double and single stranded<br>
RNA and DNA, and backbone modifications thereof, for example, methylphosphonate<br>
linkages; oar (7) detoxified mutants of a bacterial ADP-ribosylating toxin such as a<br>
cholera toxin (CT), a pertussis toxin (PT), or an E. coli heat-labile toxin (LT),<br>
particularly LT-K63 (where lysine is substituted for the wild-type amino acid at<br>
position 63) LT-R72 (where arginine is substituted for the wild-type amino acid at<br>
position 72), CT-S109 (where serine is substituted for the wild-type amino acid at<br>
position 109), and PT-K9/G129 (where lysine is substituted for the wild-type amino<br>
acid at position 9 and glycine substituted at position 129) (see, e.g., International<br>
Publication Nos. WO93/13202 and W092/19265); and (8) other substances that act as<br>
immunostimulating agents to enhance the effectiveness of the composition. Further,<br>
such polymeric molecules include alternative polymer backbone structures such as, but<br>
not limited to, polyvinyl backbones (Pitha, Biochem Biophys Acta, 204:39,1970a;<br>
Pitha, Biopolymers, 2:965,1970b), and morpholino backbones (Summerton, J., et aL,<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,142,047, issued 08/25/92; Summerton, J., et al., U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,185,444 issued 02/09/93). A variety of other charged and uncharged polynucleotide<br>
analogs have been reported. Numerous backbone modifications are known in the art,<br>
including, but not limited to, uncharged linkages {e.g., methyl phosphonates,<br>
phosphotriesters, phosphoamidates, and carbamates) and charged linkages {e.g.,<br>
phosphorothioates and phosphorodithioates).}; and (7) other substances that act as<br>
inimunostimulating agents to enhance the effectiveness of the VLP immune-stimulating<br>
(or vaccine) composition. Alum, CpG oligonucleotides, and MF59 are preferred.<br>
Muramyl peptides include, but are not limited to, N-acetyl-muramyl-L-<br>
threonyl-D-isoglutamine (thr-MDP), N-acteyl-normuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isogluatme<br>
(nor-MDP), N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isogluatminyl-L-aIanine-2-(1'-2'-dipalmitoyl-<br>
sn-glycero-3-huydroxyphosphoryloxy)-ethylamine (MTP-PE), etc.<br>
Dosage treatment with the VLP composition may be a single dose schedule or<br>
a multiple dose schedule. A multiple dose schedule is one in which a primary course of<br>
vaccination may be with 1-10 separate doses, followed by other doses given at<br>
subsequent time intervals, chosen to maintain and/or reinforce the immune response,<br>
for example at 1-4 months for a second dose, and if needed, a subsequent dose(s) after<br>
several months. The dosage regimen will also, at least in part, be determined by the<br>
need of the subject and be dependent on the judgment of the practitioner.<br>
If prevention of disease is desired, the antigen carrying VLPs are generally<br>
administered prior to primary infection with the pathogen of interest. If treatment is<br>
desired, e.g., the reduction of symptoms or recurrences, the VLP compositions are<br>
generally administered subsequent to primary infection.<br>
2.3.2 USING THE SYNTHETIC EXPRESSION CASSETTES OF THE PRESENT<br>
INVENTION TO CREATE PACKAGING CELL LINES<br>
A number of viral based systems have been developed for use as gene transfer<br>
vectors for mammalian host cells. For example, retroviruses (in particular, lentrviral<br>
vectors) provide a convenient platform for gene delivery systems. A coding sequence<br>
of interest (for example, a sequence useful for gene therapy applications) can be<br>
inserted into a gene delivery vector and packaged in retro viral particles using<br>
techniques known in the art. Recombinant virus can then be isolated and delivered to<br>
cells of the subject either in vivo or ex vivo. A number of retroviral systems have been<br>
described, including, for example, the following: (U.S. Patent No. 5,219,740; Miller et<br>

In other embodiments, gene transfer vectors can be constructed to encode a<br>
cytokine or other immunomodulatory molecule. For example, nucleic acid sequences<br>
encoding native IL-2 and gamma-interferon can be obtained as described in US Patent<br>
Nos. 4,738,927 and 5,326,859, respectively, while useful muteins of these proteins can<br>
be obtained as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,853,332. Nucleic acid sequences<br>
encoding the short and long forms of mCSF can be obtained as described in US Patent<br>
Nos. 4,847,201 and 4,879,227, respectively. In particular aspects of the invention,<br>
retroviral vectors expressing cytokine or immunomodulatory genes can be produced as<br>
described herein (for example, employing the packaging cell lines of the present<br>
invention) and in International Application No. PCT US 94/02951, entitled<br>

Immnnomodulatory factors may also be agonists, antagonists, or ligands for<br>
these molecules. For example, soluble forms of receptors can often behave as<br>
antagonists for these types of factors, as can mutated forms of the factors themselves.<br>
Nucleic acid molecules that encode the above-described substances, as well as<br>
other nucleic acid molecules that are advantageous for use within the present<br>
invention, may be readily obtained from a variety of sources, including, for example,<br>
depositories such as the American Type Culture Collection, or from commercial<br>
sources such as British Bio-Technology limited (Cowley, Oxford England).<br>
Representative examples include BBG 12 (containing the GM-CSF gene coding for the<br>
mature protein of 127 amino acids), BBG 6 (which contains sequences encoding<br>
gamma interferon), A.T.C.C. Deposit No. 39656 (which contains sequences encoding<br>
TNF), A-T.C.C. Deposit No. 20663 (which contains sequences encoding alpha-<br>
interferon), A.T.C.C. Deposit Nos. 31902, 31902 and 39517 (which contain sequences<br>
encoding beta-interferon), A.T.C.C. Deposit No. 67024 (which contains a sequence<br>
which encodes Interleukin-1b), A.T.C.C. Deposit Nos. 39405, 39452, 39516, 39626<br>
and 39673 (which contain sequences encoding Interleukin-2), A.T.C.C. Deposit Nos.<br>
59399, 59398, and 67326 (which contain sequences encoding Interleukin-3), A.T.C.C.<br>

Deposit Nos. 59394 and 59395 (which contain sequences encoding Interteukin-5), and<br>
A.T.C.C. Deposit No. 67153 (which contains sequences encoding Interleukin-6).<br>
Plasmids containing cytokine genes or immunomodulatory genes (International<br>
Publication Nos. WO 94/02951 and WO 96/21015) can be digested with appropriate<br>
restriction enzymes, and DNA fragments containing the particular gene of interest can<br>
be inserted into a gene transfer vector using standard molecular biology techniques.<br>
(See, e.g., Sambrook et al., supra, or Ausubel et al. (eds) Current Protocols in<br>
Molecular Biology, Greene Publishing and Wiley-Interscience).<br>
Polynucleotide sequences coding for the above-described molecules can be<br>
obtained using recombinant methods, such as by screening cDNA and genomic<br>
libraries from cells expressing the gene, or by deriving the gene from a vector known<br>
to include the same. For example, plasmids which contain sequences that encode<br>
altered cellular products may be obtained from a depository such as the A.T.C.C., or<br>
from commercial sources. Plasmids containing the nucleotide sequences of interest<br>
can be digested with appropriate restriction enzymes, and DNA fragments containing<br>
the nucleotide sequences can be inserted into a gene transfer vector using standard<br>
molecular biology techniques.<br>
Alternatively, cDNA sequences for use with the present invention may be<br>
obtained from cells which express or contain the sequences, using standard techniques,<br>
such as phenol extraction and PCR of cDNA or genomic DNA See, e.g., Sambrook<br>
et aL, supra, for a description of techniques used to obtain and isolate DNA. Briefly,<br>
mRNA from a cell which expresses the gene of interest can be reverse transcribed with<br>
reverse transcriptase using oligo-dT or random primers. The single stranded cDNA<br>
may then be amplified by PCR (see U.S. Patent Nos. 4,683,202,4,683,195 and<br>
4,800,159, see also PCR Technology: Principles and Applications for DNA<br>
Amplification, Erlich (ed.), Stockton Press, 1989)) using oligonucleotide primers<br>
complementary to sequences on either side of desired sequences.<br>
The nucleotide sequence of interest can also be produced synthetically, rather<br>
than cloned, using a DNA synthesizer (eg., an Applied Biosystems Model 392 DNA<br>
Synthesizer, available from ABI, Foster City, California). The nucleotide sequence can<br>
be designed with the appropriate codons for the expression product desired. The<br>
complete sequence is assembled from overlapping oligonucleotides prepared by<br>
standard methods and assembled into a complete coding sequence. See, e.g., Edge<br>
(1981) Nature 292:756; Nambair et al., (1984) Science 223jl299; Jay et al., (1984) J.<br>
Biol. Chem. 259:6311.<br>
The synthetic expression cassettes of the present invention can be employed in<br>
the construction of packaging cell lines for use with retro viral vectors.<br>
One type of retrovirus, the murine leukemia virus, or "MLV", has been widely<br>
utilized for gene therapy applications (see generally Mann et al. (Cell 33:153, 1993),<br>
Cane and Mulligan (Proc, Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:6349, 1984), and Miller et al.,<br>
Human Gene Therapy 1:5-14,1990.<br>
Lentiviral vectors typically, comprise a 5' lentiviral LTR, a tRNA binding site, a<br>
packaging signal, a promoter operably linked to one or more genes of interest, an<br>
origin of second strand DNA synthesis and a 3' lentiviral LTR, wherein the lentiviral<br>
vector contains a nuclear transport element. The nuclear transport element may be<br>
located either upstream (5') or downstream (3') of a coding sequence of interest (for<br>
example, a synthetic Gag or Env expression cassette of the present invention). Within<br>
certain embodiments, the nuclear transport element is not RRE. Within one<br>
embodiment the packaging signal is an extended packaging signal. Within other<br>
embodiments the promoter is a tissue specific promoter, or, alternatively, a promoter<br>
such as CMV. Within other embodiments, the lentiviral vector further comprises an<br>
internal ribosome entry site.<br>
A wide variety of lentiviruses may be utilized within the context of the present<br>
invention, including for example, lentiviruses selected from the group consisting of<br>
HIV, HIV-1, HIV-2, FIV and SIV.<br>
Within yet another aspect of the invention, host cells (e.g., packaging cell lines)<br>
are provided which contain any of the expression cassettes described herein. For<br>
example, within one aspect packaging cell line are provided comprising an expression<br>
cassette that comprises a sequence encoding synthetic Gag-polymerase, and a nuclear<br>
transport element, wherein the promoter is operably linked to the sequence encoding<br>
Gag-polymerase. Packaging cell lines may further comprise a promoter and a sequence<br>
encoding tat, rev, or an envelope, wherein the promoter is operably linked to the<br>
sequence encoding tat, rev, Env or sequences encoding modified versions of these<br>
proteins. The packaging cell line may farther comprise a sequence encoding any one<br>
or more of other HIV gene encoding sequences.<br>
In one embodiment, the expression cassette (carrying, for example, the<br>
synthetic Gag-polymerase) is stably integrated. The packaging cell line, upon<br>
introduction of a lentiviral vector, typically produces particles. The promoter<br>
regulating expression of the synthetic expression cassette may be inducible. Typically,<br>
tbe packaging cell line, upon introduction of a lentiviral vector, produces particles that<br>
are essentially free of replication competent virus.<br>
Packaging cell lines are provided comprising an expression cassette which<br>
directs the expression of a synthetic Gag-polymerase gene or comprising an expression<br>
cassette which directs the expression of a synthetic Env genes described herein. (See,<br>
also, Andre, S., et al., Journal of Virology 72(2): 1497-1503, 1998; Haas, J., et al,<br>
Current Biology 6(3):315-324, 1996) for a description of other modified Env<br>
sequences). A lentiviral vector is introduced into the packaging cell line to produce a<br>
vector producing cell line.<br>
As noted above, lentiviral vectors can be designed to carry or express a<br>
selected gene(s) or sequences of interest. Lentiviral vectors may be readily<br>
constructed from a wide variety of lentiviruses (see RNA Tumor Viruses, Second<br>
Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, 1985). Representative examples of<br>
lentiviruses included HIV, HIV-1, HIV-2, FIV and SIV. Such lentiviruses may either<br>
be obtained from patient isolates, or, more preferably, from depositories or collections<br>
such as the American Type Culture Collection, or isolated from known sources using<br>
available techniques.<br>
Portions of the lentiviral gene delivery vectors (or vehicles) may be derived<br>
from different viruses. For example, in a given recombinant lentiviral vector, LTRs<br>
may be derived from an HIV, a packaging signal from SIV, and an origin of second<br>
strand synthesis from HrV-2. Lentiviral vector constructs may comprise a 5' lentiviral<br>
LTR, a tRNA binding site, a packaging signal, one or more heterologons sequences,<br>
an origin of second strand DNA synthesis and a 3' LTR, wherein said lentiviral vector<br>
contains a nuclear transport element that is not RRE.<br>
Briefly, Long Terminal Repeats ("LTRs") are subdivided into three elements,<br>
designated U5, R and U3. These elements contain a variety of signals which are<br>
responsible for the biological activity of a retrovirus, including for example, promoter<br>
and enhancer elements which are located within U3. LTRs may be readily identified in<br>
the provirus (integrated DNA form) due to their precise duplication at either end of the<br>
genome. As utilized herein, a 5' LTR should be understood to include a 5' promoter<br>
element and sufficient LTR sequence to allow reverse transcription and integration of<br>
the DNA form of the vector. The 31 LTR should be understood to include a<br>
polyadenylation signal, and sufficient LTR sequence to allow reverse transcription and<br>
integration of the DNA form of the vector.<br>
The tRNA binding site and origin of second strand DNA synthesis are also<br>
important for a retrovirus to be biologically active, and may be readily identified by one<br>
of skill in the art For example, retroviral tRNA binds to a tRNA binding site by<br>
Watson-Crick base pairing, and is carried with the retrovirus genome into a viral<br>
particle. The tRNA is then utilized as a primer for DNA synthesis by reverse<br>
transcriptase. The tRNA binding site may be readily identified based upon its location<br>
just downstream from the 5LTR. Similarly, the origin of second strand DNA synthesis<br>
is, as its name implies, important for the second strand DNA synthesis of a retrovirus.<br>
This region, which is also referred to as the poly-purine tract, is located just upstream<br>
of the 3LTR.<br>
In addition to a 5' and 3' LTR, tRNA binding site, and origin of second strand<br>
DNA synthesis, recombinant retroviral vector constructs may also comprise a<br>
packaging signal, as well as one or more genes or coding sequences of interest. In<br>
addition, the lentiviral vectors have a nuclear transport element which, in preferred<br>
embodiments is not RRE. Representative examples of suitable nuclear transport<br>
elements include the element in Rous sarcoma virus (Ogert, et al, J ViroL 70, 3834-<br>
3843, 1996), the element in Rous sarcoma virus (Liu &amp; Mertz, Genes &amp; Dev., 9, 1766-<br>
1789,199S) and die element in the genome of simian retrovirus type I (Zolotukhin, et<br>
at, J Virol 68, 7944-7952,1994). Other potential elements include the elements in<br>
the histone gene (Kedes, Amu. Rev. Biochem. 48, 837-870,1970), the a-interferon<br>
gene (Nagata et aL, Nature 287, 401-408,1980), the ß-adrenergic receptor gene<br>
(Koilka, et aL, Nature 329, 75-79,1987), and the c-Jun gene (Hattorie, et al., Proc.<br>
Natl Acad. Sci. USA 85, 9148-9152, 1988).<br>
Recombinant lentiviral vector constructs typically lack both Gag-polymerase<br>
and Env coding sequences. Recombinant lentiviral vector typically contain less than<br>
20, preferably 15, more preferably 10, and most preferably 8 consecutive nucleotides<br>
found in Gag-polymerase and Env genes. One advantage of the present invention is<br>
that the synthetic Gag-polymerase expression cassettes, which can be used to<br>
construct packaging cell lines for the recombinant retroviral vector constructs, have<br>
little homology to wild-type Gag-polymerase sequences and thus considerably reduce<br>
or eliminate the possibility of homologous recombination between the synthetic and<br>
wild-type sequences.<br>
Lenriviral vectors may also include tissue-specific promoters to drive<br>
expression of one or more genes or sequences of interest.<br>
Lentiviral vector constructs may be generated such that more than one gene of<br>
interest is expressed. This may be accomplished through the use of di- or oligo-<br>
cistronic cassettes (e.g., where the coding regions are separated by 80 nucleotides or<br>
less, see generally Levin et al., Gene 108:167-174, 1991), or through the use of<br>
Internal Ribosome Entry Sites ("IRES").<br>
Packaging cell lines suitable for use with the above described recombinant<br>
retroviral vector constructs may be readily prepared given the disclosure provided<br>
herein. Briefly, the parent cell line from which the packaging cell line is derived can be<br>
selected from a variety of mammalian cell lines, including for example, 293, RD, COS-<br>
7, CHO, BHK, VERO, HT1080, and myeloma cells.<br>
After selection of a suitable host cell for the generation of a packaging cell line,<br>
one or more expression cassettes are introduced into the cell line in order to<br>
complement or supply in trans components of the vector which have been deleted.<br>
Representative examples of suitable synthetic HIV polynucleotide sequences<br>
have been described herein for use in expression cassettes of the present invention. As<br>
described above, the native and/or synthetic coding sequences may also be utilized in<br>
these expression cassettes.<br>
Utilizing the above-described expression cassettes, a wide variety of packaging<br>
cell lines can be generated. For example, within one aspect packaging cell line are<br>
provided comprising an expression cassette that comprises a sequence encoding<br>
synthetic Gag-polymerase, and a nuclear transport element, wherein the promoter is<br>
operably linked to the sequence encoding Gag-polymerase. Within other aspects,<br>
packaging cell lines are provided comprising a promoter and a sequence encoding tat,<br>
rev, Env, or other HIV antigens or epitopes derived therefrom, wherein the promoter<br>
is operably linked to the sequence encoding tat, rev, Env, or the HIV antigen or<br>
epitope. Within further embodiments, the packaging cell line may comprise a sequence<br>
encoding any one or more of tat, rev, nef, vif, vpu or vpr. For example, the packaging<br>
cell line may contain only tat, rev, nef, vif, vpu, or vpr alone, tat rev and nef, nef and<br>
vif, nef and vpu, nef and vpr, vif and vpu, vif and vpr, vpu and vpr, nef vif and vpu, nef<br>
vif and vpr, nef vpu and vpr, vif vpu and vpr, all four of nef, vif, vpu, and vpr, etc.<br>
In one embodiment, the expression cassette is stably integrated. Within<br>
another embodiment, the packaging cell line, upon introduction of a lentiviral vector,<br>
produces particles. Within further embodiments the promoter is inducible. Within<br>
certain preferred embodiments of the invention, the packaging cell line, upon<br>
introduction of a lentiviral vector, produces particles that are free of replication<br>
competent virus.<br>
The synthetic cassettes containing modified coding sequences are transfected<br>
into a selected cell line. Transfected cells are selected that (i) carry, typically,<br>
integrated, stable copies of the HIV coding sequences, and (ii) are expressing<br>
acceptable levels of these polypeptides (expression can be evaluated by methods<br>
known in the prior art in view of the teachings of the present disclosure). The ability<br>
of the cell line to produce VLPs may also be verified.<br>
A sequence of interest is constructed into a suitable viral vector as discussed<br>
above. This defective virus is then transfected into the packaging cell line. The<br>
packaging cell line provides the viral functions necessary for producing virus-like<br>
particles into which the defective viral genome, containing the sequence of interest, are<br>
packaged. These VLPs are then isolated and can be used, for example, in gene<br>
delivery or gene therapy.<br>
Further, such packaging cell fines can also be used to produce VLPs alone,<br>
which can, for example, be used as adjuvants for administration with other antigens or<br>
in vaccine compositions. Also, co-expression of a selected sequence of interest<br>
encoding a polypeptide (for example, an antigen) in the packaging cell line can also<br>
result in the entrapment and/or association of the selected polypeptide in/with the<br>
VLPs.<br>
Various forms of the different embodiments of the present invention {e.g.,<br>
synthetic constructs) may be combined.<br>
2.4.0 DNA Immunization and Gene Delivery<br>
A variety of HIV polypeptide antigens, particularly HIV antigens, can be used<br>
in the practice of the present invention. HIV antigens can be included in DNA<br>
immunization constructs containing, for example, a synthetic Env expression cassettes,<br>
a synthetic Gag expression cassette, a synthetic pol-derived polypeptide expression<br>
cassette, a synthetic expression cassette comprising sequences encoding one or more<br>
accessory or regulatory genes (e.g., tat, rev, nef, vif, vpu, vpr), and/or a synthetic Gag<br>
expression cassette fused in-frame to a coding sequence for the polypeptide antigen<br>
(synthetic or wild-type), where expression of the construct results in VLPs presenting<br>
the antigen of interest.<br>
HIV antigens of particular interest to be used in the practice of the present<br>
invention include pol, tat, rev, nef, vif, vpu, vpr, and other HIV-1 (also known as<br>
HTLV-III, LAV, ARV, etc.) antigens or epitopes derived therefrom, including, but not<br>
limited to, antigens such as gp120, gp41, gp160 (both native and modified); Gag; and<br>
pol from a variety of isolates including, but not limited to, HIVIIIb,, HIVSF2, HIV-1SF162,<br>
HIV-lSF170, HIVLAV, HIVLAI, HIVmn, HIV-1CM235, HIV-1US4, other HIV-1 strains from<br>
diverse subtypes(e.g., subtypes, A through G, and O), HIV-2 strains and diverse<br>
subtypes (e.g., HIV-2UC1 and HIV-2UC2). See, e.g., Myers, et al., Los Alamos<br>
Database, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico; Myers, et al.,<br>
Human Retroviruses and Aids, 1990, Los Alamos, New Mexico: Los Alamos National<br>
Laboratory. These antigens may be synthetic (as described herein) or wild-type.<br>
To evaluate efficacy, DNA immunization using synthetic expression cassettes<br>
of the present invention can be performed, for example, as follows. Mice are<br>
immunized with a tat/rev/nef synthetic expression cassette. Other mice are immunized<br>
with a tat/rev/nef wild type expression cassette. Mouse immunizations with plasmid-<br>
DNAs typically show that the synthetic expression cassettes provide a clear<br>
improvement of immunogenicity relative to the native expression cassettes. Also, a<br>
second boost immunization will induce a secondary immune response, for example,<br>
after approximately two weeks. Further, the results of CTL assays typically show<br>
increased potency of synthetic expression cassettes for induction of cytotoxic T-<br>
lymphocyte (CTL) responses by DNA immunization.<br>
Exemplary primate studies directed at the evaluation of neutralizing antibodies<br>
and cellular immune responses against HIV are described below.<br>
It is readily apparent that the subject invention can be used to mount an<br>
immune response to a wide variety of antigens and hence to treat or prevent infection,<br>
particularly HIV infection.<br>
2.4.1 Delivery of the synthetic expression cassettes of the<br>
present invention<br>
Polynucleotide sequences coding for the above-described molecules can be<br>
obtained using recombinant methods, such as by screening cDNA and genomic<br>
libraries from cells expressing the gene, or by deriving the gene from a vector known<br>
to include the same. Furthermore, the desired gene can be isolated directly from cells<br>
and tissues containing the same, using standard techniques, such as phenol extraction<br>
and PCR of cDNA or genomic DNA. See, e.g., Sambrook et al, supra, for a<br>
description of techniques used to obtain and isolate DNA. The gene of interest can<br>
also be produced synthetically, rather than cloned. The nucleotide sequence can be<br>
designed with the appropriate codons for the particular ammo acid sequence desired.<br>
In general, one will select preferred codons for the intended host in which the sequence<br>
will be expressed. The complete sequence is assembled from overlapping<br>
oligonucleotides prepared by standard methods and assembled into a complete coding<br>
sequence. See, e.g., Edge, Nature (1981) 292:756; Nambair et aL, Science (1984)<br>
223:1299; Jay et aL, J. Biol Chan. (1984) 222:6311; Stemmer, W.P.C., (1995) Gene<br>
164:49-53.<br>
Next, the gene sequence encoding the desired antigen can be inserted into a<br>
vector containing a synthetic expression cassette of the present invention. In one<br>
embodiment, polynucleotides encoding selected antigens are separately cloned into<br>
expression vectors (e.g., Env-coding polynucleotide in a first vector, Gag-coding<br>
polynucleotide in a second vector, Pol-derived polypeptide-coding polynucleotide in a<br>
third vector, tat-, rev-, nef-, vif-, vpu-, vpr-coding polynucleotides in further vectors,<br>
etc.). In certain embodiments, the antigen is inserted into or adjacent a synthetic Gag<br>
coding sequence such that when the combined sequence is expressed it results in the<br>
production of VLPs comprising the Gag polypeptide and the antigen of interest, e.g.,<br>
Env (native or modified) or other antigen(s) (native or modified) derived from HIV.<br>
Insertions can be made within the coding sequence or at either end of the coding<br>
sequence (5', amino terminus of the expressed Gag polypeptide; or 3', carboxy<br>
terminus of the expressed Gag polypeptide)(Wagner, R., et aL, Arch Virol 127:117-<br>
137, 1992; Wagner, R., et aL, Virology 200:162-175,1994; Wu, X., et al, J. Virol.<br>
69(6):3389-3398, 1995; Wang, C-T., et aL, Virology 200:524-534, 1994; ChazaL N.,<br>
et al., Virology 68(1): 111-122,1994; Griffiths, J.C., et al., J. Virol. 67(6):3191-3198,<br>
1993; Reicin, A.S., et al, J. Virol 69(2):642-650, 1995).<br>
Up to 50% of the coding sequences of p55Gag can be deleted without<br>
affecting the assembly to virus-like particles and expression efficiency (Borsetti, A., et<br>
al, J. Virol. 72(11):9313-9317,1998; Gamier, L., et al., J Virol 72(6):4667-4677,<br>
1998; Zhang, Y., et aL, J. Virol 72(3): 1782-1789, 1998; Wang, C. et al., J Virol<br>
72(10): 7950-7959, 1998). In one embodiment of the present invention,<br>
immunogenicity of the high level expressing synthetic Gag expression cassettes can be<br>
increased by the insertion of different structural or non-structural HIV antigens, multi-<br>
epitope cassettes, or cytokine sequences into deleted regions of Gag sequence. Such<br>
deletions may be generated following the teachings of the present invention and<br>
information available to one of ordinary skin in the art. One possible advantage of this<br>
approach, relative to using full-length sequences fused to heterotogous polypeptides,<br>
can be higher expression/secretion efficiency of the expression product<br>
When sequences are added to the amino terminal end of Gag, the<br>
polynucleotide can contain coding sequences at the 5' end that encode a signal for<br>
addition of a myristic moiety to the Gag-containing polypeptide (e.g., sequences that<br>
encode Met-Gly).<br>
The ability of Gag-containing polypeptide constructs to form VLPs can be<br>
empirically determined following the teachings of the present specification.<br>
The synthetic expression cassettes can also include control elements operably<br>
linked to the coding sequence, which allow for the expression of the gene in vivo in the<br>
subject species. For example, typical promoters for mammalian cell expression include<br>
the SV40 early promoter, a CMV promoter such as the CMV immediate early<br>
promoter, the mouse mammary tumor virus LTR promoter, the adenovirus major late<br>
promoter (Ad MLP). and the herpes simplex virus promoter, among others. Other<br>
nonviral promoters, such as a promoter derived from the murine metallothionein gene,<br>
will also find use for mammalian expression. Typically, transcription termination and<br>
polyadenylation sequences will also be present, located 3' to the translation stop<br>
codon. Preferably, a sequence for optimization of initiation of translation, located 5'<br>
to the coding sequence, is also present. Examples of transcription<br>
terminator/polyadenylation signals include those derived from SV40, as described in<br>
Sambrook et aL, supra, as well as a bovine growth hormone terminator sequence.<br>
Enhancer elements may also be used herein to increase expression levels of the<br>
mammalian constructs. Examples include the SV40 early gene enhancer, as described<br>
in Dijkema et ai, EMBO J. (1985) 4:761, the enhancer/promoter derived from the<br>
long terminal repeat (LTR) of the Rous Sarcoma Virus, as described in Gorman et al.,<br>
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1982b) 79:6777 and elements derived from human CMV,<br>
as described in Boshart et al., Cell (1985) 41:521, such as elements included in the<br>
CMV intron A sequence.<br>
Furthermore, plasmids can be constructed which include a chimeric antigen-<br>
coding gene sequences, encoding, e.g., multiple antigens/epitopes of interest, for<br>
example derived from more than one viral isolate.<br>
Typically the antigen coding sequences precede or follow the synthetic coding<br>
sequence and the chimeric transcription unit will have a single open reading frame<br>
encoding both the antigen of interest and the synthetic coding sequences.<br>
Alternatively, multi-cistronic cassettes (e.g., bi-cistronic cassettes) can be constructed<br>
allowing expression of multiple antigens from a single mRNA using the EMCV IRES,<br>
or the like (Example 7).<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, a nucleic acid immunizing<br>
composition may comprise, for example, the following: a first expression vector<br>
comprising a Gag expression cassette, a second vector comprising an Env expression<br>
cassette, and a third expression vector comprising a Pol expression cassette, or one or<br>
more coding region of Pol (e.g., Prot, RT, RNase, Int), wherein further antigen coding<br>
sequences may be associated with the Pol expression, such antigens may be obtained,<br>
for example, from accessory genes (e.g., vpr, vpu, vif), regulatory genes (e.g., nef, tat,<br>
rev), or portions of the Pol sequences (e.g., Prot, RT, RNase, Int)). In another<br>
embodiment, a nucleic acid immunizing composition may comprise, for example, an<br>
expression cassette comprising any of the synthetic polynucleotide sequences of the<br>
present invention. In another embodiment, a nucleic acid immunizing composition may<br>
comprise, for example, an expression cassette comprising coding sequences for a<br>
number of HIV genes (or sequences derived from such genes) wherein the coding<br>
sequences are in-frame and under the control of a single promoter, for example, Gag-<br>
Env constructs, Tat-Rev-Nef constructs, P2Pol-tat-rev-nef constructs, etc. The<br>
synthetic coding sequences of the present invention may be combined in any number of<br>
combinations depending on the coding sequence products (i.e., HIV polypeptides) to<br>
which, for example, an immunological response is desired to be raised. In yet another<br>
embodiment, synthetic coding sequences for multiple HIV-derived polypeptides may<br>
be constructed into a polycistronie message under the control of a single promoter<br>
wherein IRES are placed adjacent the coding sequence for each encoded polypeptide.<br>
Exemplary synthetic polynucleotides and/or expression cassettes of the present<br>
In one general embodiment, systhetic polynucleotides and/or expression<br>
cassettes of the present invention may comprise, for example, the following: tandem<br>
repeats of Int, wherein at feast two of the gene product coding sequences are derived<br>
from different HIV Types (e.g, A-G, O); Tat-Rev-Nef, wherein at least two of the<br>
gene product coding sequences are derived from different HIV Types (e.g, A-G, O);<br>
tandem repeats of Tat-Rev-Nef coding sequences, wherein at feast two of the gene<br>
product coding sequences are derived from different HIV Types (e.g, A-G, O); Vif-<br>
Vpr-Vpu, wherein at least two of the gene product coding sequences are derived from<br>
different HIV Types (e.g, A-G, O); tandem repeats of Vif-Vpr-Vpu coding sequences,<br>
wherein at least two of the gene product coding sequences are derived from different<br>
HIV Types (e.g. A-G, O); and Tat-Rev-Nef-Vif-Vpr-Vpu, wherein at least two of the<br>
gene product coding sequences are derived from different HIV Types (e.g, A-G, O);<br>
and tandem repeats of Tat-Rev-Nef-Vif-Vpr-Vpu coding sequences, wherein at least<br>
two of the gene product coding sequences are derived from different HIV Types (e.g,<br>
A-G, O).<br>
Such synthetic polynucleotide coding sequences (for example, as described<br>
herein above) may encode functional gene products or be mutated to reduce (relative<br>
to wild-type), attenuate, inactivate, eliminate, or render non-functional the activity of<br>
the gene product(s) encoded the synthetic polynucleotide. The orders of the coding<br>
sequences within the synthetic polynucleotide may vary. An optimal order may be<br>
determined empirically based, for example, on obtaining desired expression levels of<br>
the products in a target cell type.<br>
Once complete, the constructs are used for nucleic acid immunization using<br>
standard gene delivery protocols. Methods for gene delivery are known in the art.<br>
See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,399,346, 5,580,859, 5,589,466. Genes can be delivered<br>
either directly to the vertebrate subject or, alternatively, delivered ex vivo, to cells<br>
derived from the subject and the cells reimplanted in the subject.<br>
A number of viral based systems have been developed for gene transfer into<br>
mammalian cells. For example, retroviruses provide a convenient platform for gene<br>
delivery systems. Selected sequences can be inserted into a vector and packaged in<br>
retro viral particles using techniques known in the art. The recombmant virus can then<br>
be isolated and delivered to cells of the subject either in vivo or ex vivo. A number of<br>
retroviral systems have been described (U.S. Patent No. 5,219,740; Miller and<br>
Rosman, BioTechniques (1989) 7:980-990; Miller, AD., Human Gene Therapy<br>
(1990) 1:5-14; Scarpa et aL, Virology (1991) 180:849-852; Burns et ai, Proc. Nad.<br>
Acad. Sci. USA (1993) 9J):8033-8037; and Boris-Lawrie and Temin, Cur. Opm.<br>
Genet. Develop. (1993) 2:102-109.<br>
A number of adenovirus vectors have also been described. Unlike retroviruses<br>
which integrate into the host genome, adenoviruses persist extrachromosomally thus<br>
minimizing the risks associated with insertional mutagenesis (Haj-Ahmad and Graham,<br>
J. Virol. (1986) 57:267-274; Bett et aL, 7. Virol. (1993) 67:5911-5921; Mittereder et<br>
al., Human Gene Therapy (1994) 5:717-729; Seth et al., J. Virol. (1994) 68:933-940;<br>
Barr et al., Gene Therapy (1994) 1:51-58; Berkner, K.L. BioTechnigues (1988) 6:616-<br>
629; and Rich et al., Human Gene Therapy (1993) 4:461-476).<br>
Additionally, various adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector systems have bees<br>
developed for gene delivery. AAV vectors can be readily constructed using techniques<br>
well known in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,173,414 and 5,139,941;<br>
International Publication Nos. WO 92/01070 (published 23 January 1992) and WO<br>
93/03769 (published 4 March 1993); Lebkowski et al., Molec. Cell. Biol. (1988)<br>
8:3988-3996; Vincent et at, Vaccines 90 (1990) (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory<br>
Press); Carter, B.J. Current Opinion in Biotechnology (1992) 3:533-539; Muzyczka,<br>

1:165-169; and Zhou et al., J. Exp. Med. (1994) 179:1867-1875.<br>
Another vector system useful for delivering the polynucteotides of the present<br>
invention is the enterically administered recombinant poxvirus vaccines described by<br>
Small, Jr., P.A., et al. (U.S. Patent No. 5,676,950, issued October 14, 1997).<br>
Additional viral vectors which will find use for delivering the nucleic acid<br>
molecules encoding the antigens of interest include those derived from the pox family<br>
of viruses, including vaccinia virus and avian poxvirus. By way of example, vaccinia<br>
virus recombinants expressing the genes can be constructed as follows. The DNA<br>
encoding the particular synthetic HIV polypeptide coding sequence is first inserted into<br>
an appropriate vector so mat it is adjacent to a vaccinia promoter and flanking vaccinia<br>
DNA sequences, such as the sequence encoding thymidine kinase (TK). This vector is<br>
then used to transfect cells which are simultaneously infected with vaccinia.<br>
Homologous recombination serves to insert the vaccinia promoter plus the gene<br>
encoding the coding sequences of interest into the viral genome. The resulting TK'<br>
recombinant can be selected by culturing the cells in the presence of 5-<br>
bromodeoxyuridine and picking viral plaques resistant thereto.<br>
Alternatively, avipoxviruses, such as the fowlpox and canarypox viruses, can<br>
also be used to deliver the genes. Recombinant avipox viruses, expressing<br>
immunogens from mammalian pathogens, are known to confer protective immunity<br>
when administered to non-avian species. The use of an avipox vector is particularly<br>
desirable in human and other mammalian species since members of the avipox genus<br>
can only productively replicate in susceptible avian species and therefore are not<br>
infective in mammalian cells. Methods for producing recombinant avipoxviruses are<br>
known in the art and employ genetic recombination, as described above with respect to<br>
the production of vaccinia viruses. See, e.g., WO 91/12882; WO 89/03429; and WO<br>
92/03545.<br>
Molecular conjugate vectors, such as the adenovirus chimeric vectors described<br>
in Michael et al, J. Biol. Chem. (1993) 268:6866-6869 and Wagner et al., Proc. Natl.<br>
Accud. Sci. USA (1992) 89:6099-6103, can also be used for gene delivery.<br>
Members of the Alphavirus genus, such as, but not limited to, vectors derived<br>
from the Sindbis, Semliki Forest, and Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis viruses, will also<br>
find use as viral vectors for delivering the polynucleotides of the present invention (for<br>
example, a synthetic Gag-polypeptide encoding expression cassette). For a description<br>
of Sindbis-virus derived vectors useful for the practice of the instant methods, see,<br>
Dubensky et aL, J. Virol (1996) 70:508-519; and International Publication Nos. WO<br>
95/07995 and WO 96/17072; as well as, Dubensky, Jr., T.W., et aL, U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,843,723, issued December 1,1998, and Dubensky, Jr., T.W., U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,789,245, issued August 4,1998. Preferred expression systems include, but are not<br>
limited to, eucaryotic layered vector initiation systems (e.g., US Patent No. 6,015,686,<br>
US Patent No. 5, 814,482, US Patent No. 6,015,694, US Patent No. 5,789,245, EP<br>
1029068A2, WO 9918226A2/A3, EP 00907746A2, WO 9738087A2).<br>
A vaccinia based infection/transfection system can be conveniently used to<br>
provide for inducible, transient expression of the coding sequences of interest in a host<br>
cell. In this system, cells are first infected in vitro with a vaccinia virus recombinant<br>
that encodes the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase. This polymerase displays<br>
exquisite specificity in that it only transcribes templates bearing T7 promoters.<br>
Following infection, cells are transfected with the polynucleotide of interest, driven by<br>
a T7 promoter. The polymerase expressed in the cytoplasm from the vaccinia virus<br>
recombinant transcribes the transfected DNA into RNA which is then translated into<br>
protein by the host translational machinery. The method provides for high level,<br>
transient, cytoplasmic production of large quantities of RNA and its translation<br>
products. See, e.g., Elroy-Stein and Moss, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1990)<br>
82:6743-6747; Fuerst et ai, Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA (1986) 83:8122-8126.<br>
As an alternative approach to infection with vaccinia or avipox virus<br>
recombinants, or to the delivery of genes using other viral vectors, an amplification<br>
system can be used that will lead to high level expression following introduction into<br>
host cells. Specifically, a T7 RNA polymerase promoter preceding the coding region<br>
for T7 RNA polymerase can be engineered. Translation of RNA derived from this<br>
template will generate T7 RNA polymerase which in turn will transcribe more<br>
template. Concomitantly, there will be a cDNA whose expression is under the control<br>
of the T7 promoter. Thus, some of the T7 RNA polymerase generated from<br>
translation of the amplification template RNA will lead to transcription of the desired<br>
gene. Because some T7 RNA polymerase is required to initiate the amplification, T7<br>
RNA polymerase can be introduced into cells along with the template(s) to prime the<br>
transcription reaction. The polymerase can be introduced as a protein or on a plasmid<br>
encoding the RNA polymerase. For a further discussion of T7 systems and their use<br>
for transforming cells, see, e.g., International Publication No. WO 94/26911; Studier<br>

Delivery of the expression cassettes of the present invention can also be<br>
accomplished using eucaryotic expression vectors comprising CMV-derived elements,<br>
such vectors include, but are not limited to, the following: pCMVKm2, pCMV-link<br>
pCMVPLEdhfr, and pCMV6a (all described above).<br>
Synthetic expression cassettes of interest can also be delivered without a viral<br>
vector. For example, the synthetic expression cassette can be packaged in liposomes<br>
prior to delivery to the subject or to cells derived therefrom. Lipid encapsulation is<br>
generally accomplished using liposomes which are able to stably bind or entrap and<br>
retain nucleic arid. The ratio of condensed DNA to lipid preparation can vary but will<br>
generally be around 1:1 (nag DNA:micromoles lipid), or more of lipid. For a review of<br>
the use of liposomes as carriers for delivery of nucleic acids, see, Hug and Sleight,<br>
Biochinu Biophys. Acta. (1991) 1097:1-17; Straubinger et al., in Methods of<br>
Enzymology (1983), Vol. 101, pp. 512-527.<br>
Liposomal preparations for use in the present invention include cationic<br>
(positively charged), anionic (negatively charged) and neutral preparations, with<br>
cationic liposomes particularly preferred. Cationic liposomes have been shown to<br>
mediate intracellular delivery of plasmid DNA (Feigner et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.<br>
USA (1987) 84:7413-7416); mRNA (Malone et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1989)<br>
86:6077-6081); and purified transcription factors (Debs et al., J. Biol. Chem. (1990)<br>
265:10189-10192), in functional form.<br>
Cationic liposomes are readily available. For example, N[ 1-2,3-<br>
diolesyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-triethylaammonium (DOTMA) liposomes are available under<br>
the trademark Lipofectin, from GIBCO BRL, Grand Island, NY. (See, also, Feigner et<br>
al., Proc. NatL Acad. Sci. USA (1987) 84:7413-7416). Other commercially available<br>
lipids include (DDAB/DOPE) and DOTAP/DOPE (Boerhinger). Other cationic<br>
liposomes can be prepared from readily available materials using techniques well<br>
known in the art. See, e.g., Szoka et al., Proc. NatL Acad. Sci. USA (1978) 75:4194-<br>
4198; PCT Publication No. WO 90/11092 for a description of the synthesis of DOTAP<br>
(1,2-bis(oleoyloxy)-3-(trimethylammonio)propane) liposomes.<br>
Similarly, anionic and neutral liposomes are readily available, such as, from<br>
Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL), or can be easuy prepared using readily<br>
available materials. Such materials include phosphatidyl choline, cholesterol,<br>
phosphatidyl ethanolamine, dioleoylphosphatidyl chohne (DOPC),<br>
dioleoylphosphatidyl glycerol (DOPG), dioleoylphoshatidyl ethanolamine (DOPE),<br>
among others. These materials can also be mixed with the DOTMA and DOTAP<br>
starting materials in appropriate ratios. Methods for making liposomes using these<br>
materials are well known in the art.<br>
The liposomes can comprise rnultilammelar vesicles (MLVs), small unilamellar<br>
vesicles (SUVs), or large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs). The various liposome-nucleic<br>
acid complexes are prepared using methods known in the art. See, e.g., Straubinger et<br>
ah, in METHODS OF IMMUNOLOGY (1983), Vol. 101, pp. 512-527; Szoka et al.,<br>

Biophys. Acta (1975) 394:483; Wilson et al., Cell (1979) 17:77); Deamer and<br>

et al., J. Biol. Chem. (1980) 255.: 10431; Szoka and Papahadjopoulos, Proc. NatL<br>
Acad. Sci. USA (1978) 75:145; and Schaefer-Ridder et al., Science (1982) 215:166.<br>
The DNA and/or protein antigen(s) can also be delivered in cochleate lipid<br>
compositions similar to those described by Papahadjopoulos et al., Biochem. Biophys.<br>
Acta. (1975) 394:483-491. See, also, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,663,161 and 4,871,488.<br>
The synthetic expression cassette of interest may also be encapsulated,<br>
adsorbed to, or associated with, particulate carriers. Such carriers present multiple<br>
copies of a selected antigen to the immune system and promote trapping and retention<br>
of antigens in local lymph nodes. The particles can be phagocytosed by macrophages<br>
and can enhance antigen presentation through cytokine release. Examples of<br>
particulate carriers include those derived from polymethyl methacrylale polymers, as<br>
well as micropartieles derived from poly(lactides) and poly(lactide-co-gh/colides),<br>
known as PLG. See, e.g., Jeffery et aL, Pharm. Res. (1993) 10:362-368; McGee JP,<br>
et aL, J Microencapsul. 14(2): 197-210,1997; OHagan DT, et aL, Vaccine 11(2): 149-<br>
54, 1993. Suitable microparticles may also be manufactured in the presence of<br>
charged detergents, such as anionic or cationic detergents, to yield microparticles with<br>
a surface having a net negative or a net positive charge. For example, microparticles<br>
manufactured with anionic detergents, such as hexadecytoimethylaramonium bromide<br>
(CTAB), Le. CTAB-PLG microparticles, adsorb negatively charged macromolecules,<br>
such as DNA. (see, e.g., Lnfl Application Number PCT/US99/17308).<br>
Furthermore, other particulate systems and polymers can be used for the in<br>
vivo or ex vivo delivery of the gene of interest. For example, polymers such as<br>
polylysine, polyarginine, polyomithine, spermine, spermidine, as well as conjugates of<br>
these molecules, are useful for transferring a nucleic acid of interest. Similarly, DEAE<br>
dextran-mediated transfection, calcium phosphate precipitation or precipitation using<br>
other insoluble inorganic salts, such as strontium phosphate, aluminum silicates<br>
including bEntonite and kaolin, chromic oxide, magnesium silicate, talc, and the like,<br>
will find use with the present methods. See, e.g., Feigner, P.L., Advanced Drug<br>
Delivery Reviews (1990) 5:163-187, for a review of delivery systems useful for gene<br>
transfer. Peptoids (Zuckerman, R.N., et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,831,005, issued<br>
November 3, 1998) may also be used for delivery of a construct of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Additionally, biolistk delivery systems employing particulate carriers such as<br>
gold and tungsten, are especially useful for delivering synthetic expression cassettes of<br>
the present invention. The particles are coated with the synthetic expression<br>
cassette(s) to be delivered and accelerated to high velocity, generally under a reduced<br>
atmosphere, using a gun powder discharge from a "gene gun." For a description of<br>
such techniques, and apparatuses useful therefore, see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
4,945,050; 5,036,006; 5,100,792; 5,179,022; 5,371,015; and 5,478,744. Also, needle-<br>
less injection systems can be used (Davis, H.L., et al, Vaccine 12:1503-1509, 1994;<br>
Bioject, Inc., Portland, OR).<br>
Recombinant vectors carrying a synthetic expression cassette of the present<br>
invention are formulated into compositions for delivery to the vertebrate subject.<br>
These compositions may either be prophylactic (to prevent infection) or therapeutic (to<br>
treat disease after infection). The compositions will comprise a "therapeutically<br>
effective amount" of the gene of interest such that an amount of the antigen can be<br>
produced in vivo so that an immune response is generated in the individual to which it<br>
is administered. The exact amount necessary will vary depending on the subject being<br>
treated; the age and general condition of the subject to be treated; the capacity of the<br>
subject's immune system to synthesize antibodies; the degree of protection desired; the<br>
severity of the condition being treated; the particular antigen selected and its mode of<br>
administration, among other factors. An appropriate effective amount can be readily<br>
determined by one of skill in the art. Thus, a "therapeutically effective amount" will<br>
fall in a relatively broad range that can be determined through routine trials.<br>
The compositions will generally include one or more "pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable excipients or vehicles" such as water, saline, glycerol, polyethyleneglycol,<br>
hyaluronic acid, ethanol, etc. Additionally, auxiliary substances, such as wetting or<br>
emulsifying agents, pH buffering substances, and the like, may be present in such<br>
vehicles. Certain facilitators of nucleic acid uptake and/or expression can also be<br>
included in the compositions or coadministered, such as, but not limited to,<br>
bupivacaine, cardiotoxin and sucrose.<br>
Once formulated, the compositions of the invention can be administered<br>
directly to the subject (e.g., as described above) or, alternatively, delivered ex vivo, to<br>
cells derived from the subject, using methods such as those described above. For<br>
example, methods for the ex vivo delivery and reimplantation of transformed cells into<br>
a subject are known in the art and can include, e.g., dextran-mediated transfection,<br>
calcium phosphate precipitation, polybrene mediated transfection, lipofectamine and<br>
LT-1 mediated transfection, protoplast fusion, electroporation, encapsulation of the<br>
polynucleotide(s) (with or without the corresponding antigen) in liposomes, and direct<br>
microinjection of the DNA into nuclei.<br>
Direct delivery of synthetic expression cassette compositions in vivo will<br>
generally be accomplished with or without viral vectors, as described above, by<br>
injection using either a conventional syringe or a gene gun, such as the Accell® gene<br>
delivery system (PowderJect Technologies, Inc., Oxford, England). The constructs<br>
can be injected either subcutaneously, epidermally, intradermally, intramucosally such<br>
as nasally, rectally and vagmally, intraperitoneally, intravenously, orally or<br>
intramuscularly. Delivery of DNA into cells of the epidermis is particularly preferred<br>
as this mode of administration provides access to skin-associated lymphoid cells and<br>
provides for a transient presence of DNA in the recipient. Other modes of<br>
administration include oral and pulmonary administration, suppositories, needle-less<br>
injection, transcutaneous and transdermal applications. Dosage treatment may be a<br>
single dose schedule or a multiple dose schedule. Administration of nucleic acids may<br>
also be combined with administration of peptides or other substances.<br>
Exemplary immunogenicity studies are presented in Examples 4,5, 6, 9,10,<br>
11, and 12.<br>
2.4.2 EX VIVO DELIVERY OF THE SYNTHETIC EXPRESSION CASSETTES OF<br>
THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
In one embodiment, T cells, and related cell types (including but not limited to<br>
antigen presenting cells, such as, macrophage, monocytes, lymphoid cells, dendritic<br>
cells, B-cells, T-cells, stem cells, and progenitor cells thereof), can be used for ex vivo<br>
delivery of the synthetic expression cassettes of the present invention. T cells can be<br>
isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) by a variety of procedures known<br>
to those skilled in the art. For example, T cell populations can be "enriched" from a<br>
population of PBLs through the removal of accessory and B cells. In particular, T cell<br>
enrichment can be accomplished by the elimination of non-T cells using anti-MHC<br>
class II monoclonal antibodies. Similarly, other antibodies can be used to deplete<br>
specific populations of non-T cells. For example, anti-Ig antibody molecules can be<br>
used to deplete B cells and anti-MacI antibody molecules can be used to deplete<br>
macrophages.<br>
T cells can be further fractionated into a number of different subpopulations by<br>
techniques known to those skilled in the art. Two major subpopulations can be<br>
isolated based on their differential expression of the cell surface markers CD4 and<br>
CDS. For example, following the enrichment of T cells as described above, CD4+ cells<br>
can be enriched using antibodies specific for CD4 (see Coliganet al., supra). The<br>
antibodies may be coupled to a solid support such as magnetic beads. Conversely,<br>
CD8+ cells can be enriched through the use of antibodies specific for CD4 (to remove<br>
CD4+ cells), or can be isolated by the use of CD8 antibodies coupled to a solid<br>
support. CD4 lymphocytes from HIV-1 infected patients can be expanded ex vivo,<br>
before or after transduction as described by Wilson et. al., (1995) J. Infect. Dis.<br>
172:88.<br>
Following purification of T cells, a variety of methods of genetic modification<br>
known to those skilled in the art can be performed using non-viral or viral-based gene<br>
transfer vectors constructed as described herein. For example, one such approach<br>
involves transduction of the purified T cell population with vector-containing<br>
supernatant of cultures derived from vector producing cells. A second approach<br>
involves co-cultivation of an irradiated monolayer of vector-producing cells with the<br>
purified T cells. A third approach involves a similar co-cultivation approach; however,<br>
the purified T cells are pre-stimulated with various cytokines and cultured 48 hours<br>
prior to the co-cultivation with the irradiated vector producing cells. Pre-stimulation<br>
prior to such transduction increases effective gene transfer (Nolta et al. (1992) Exp.<br>
Hematol. 20:1065). Stimulation of these cultures to proliferate also provides<br>
increased cell populations for re-infusion into the patient. Subsequent to co-<br>
cultivation, T cells are collected from the vector producing cell monolayer, expanded,<br>
and frozen in liquid nitrogen.<br>
Gene transfer vectors, containing one or more synthetic expression cassette of<br>
the present invention (associated with appropriate control elements for delivery to the<br>
isolated T cells) can be assembled using known methods and following the guidance of<br>
the present specification.<br>
Selectable markers can also be used in the construction of gene transfer<br>
vectors. For example, a marker can be used which imparts to a mammalian cell<br>
transduced with the gene transfer vector resistance to a cytotoxic agent. The cytotoxic<br>
agent can be, but is not limited to, neomycin, aminogrycoside, tetracycline,<br>
chloramphenicol, sulfonamide, actinomycin, netropsin, distamycin A, anthracycline, or<br>
pyrazmamide. For example, neomycin phosphotransferase II imparts resistance to the<br>
neomycin analogue geneticin (G418).<br>
The T cells can also be maintained in a medium containing at feast one type of<br>
growth factor prior to being selected. A variety of growth factors are known in the art<br>
which sustain the growth of a particular cell type. Examples of such growth factors<br>
are cytokme mitogens such as rIL-2, IL-10, IL-12, and IL-15, which promote growth<br>
and activation of lymphocytes. Certain types of cells are stimulated by other growth<br>
factors such as hormones, including human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and human<br>
growth hormone. The selection of an appropriate growth factor for a particular cell<br>
population is readily accomplished by one of skill in the art.<br>
For example, white blood cells such as differentiated progenitor and stem cells<br>
are stimulated by a variety of growth factors. More particularly, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-<br>
6,IL-9, GM-CSF, M-CSF, and G-CSF, produced by activated TH and activated<br>
macrophages, stimulate myeloid stem cells, which then differentiate into pluripotent<br>
stem cells, granulocyte-monocyte progenitors, eosinophil progenitors, basophil<br>
progenitors, megakaryocytes, and erythroid progenitors. Differentiation is modulated<br>
by growth factors such as GM-CSF, IL-3, IL-6, IL-11, and EPO.<br>
Pluripotent stem cells then differentiate into lymphoid stem cells, bone marrow<br>
stromal cells, T cell progenitors, B cell progenitors, thymocytes, TH Cells, Tc cells, and<br>
B cells. This differentiation is modulated by growth factors such as IL-3, IL-4, IL-6,<br>
IL-7, GM-CSF, M-CSF, G-CSF, IL-2, and IL-5.<br>
Granulocyte-monocyte progenitors differentiate to monocytes, macrophages,<br>
and neutrophils. Such differentiation is modulated by the growth factors GM-CSF, M-<br>
CSF, and IL-8. Eosinophil progenitors differentiate into eosinophils. This process is<br>
modulated by GM-CSF and IL-5.<br>
The differentiation of basophil progenitors into mast cells and basophils is<br>
modulated by GM-CSF, IL-4, and IL-9. Megakaryocytes produce platelets in<br>
response to GM-CSF, EPO, and IL-6. Erythroid progenitor cells differentiate into red<br>
blood cells in response to EPO.<br>
Thus, during activation by the CD3-binding agent, T cells can also be<br>
contacted with a mitogen, for example a cytokine such as IL-2. In particularly<br>
preferred embodiments, the IL-2 is added to the population of T cells at a<br>
concentration of about 50 to 100 µg/mL Activation with the CD3-binding agent can<br>
be carried out for 2 to 4 days.<br>
Once suitably activated, the T cells are genetically modified by contacting the<br>
same with a suitable gene transfer vector under conditions that allow for'transfection<br>
of the vectors into the T cells. Genetic modification is carried out when the cell<br>
density of the T cell population is between about 0.1 x 106 and 5 x 106, preferably<br>
between about 0.5 x 106 and 2 x 106. A number of suitable viral and nonviral-based<br>
gene transfer vectors have been described for use herein.<br>
After transduction, transduced cells are selected away from non-transduced<br>
cells using known techniques. For example, if the gene transfer vector used in the<br>
transduction includes a selectable marker which confers resistance to a cytotoxic<br>
agent, the cells can be contacted with the appropriate cytotoxic agent, whereby non-<br>
transduced cells can be negatively selected away from the transduced cells. If the<br>
selectable marker is a cell surface marker, the cells can be contacted with a binding<br>
agent specific for the particular cell surface marker, whereby the transduced cells can<br>
be positively selected away from the population. The selection step can also entail<br>
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) techniques, such as where FACS is used to<br>
select cells from the population containing a particular surface marker, or the selection<br>
step can entail the use of magnetically responsive particles as retrievable supports for<br>
target cell capture and/or background removal.<br>
More particularly, positive selection of the transduced cells can be performed<br>
using a FACS cell sorter (e.g. a FACSVantage™ Cell Sorter, Becton Dickinson<br>
Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA) to sort and collect transduced cells<br>
expressing a selectable cell surface marker. Following transduction, the cells are<br>
stained with fluorescent-labeled antibody molecules directed against the particular cell<br>
surface marker. The amount of bound antibody on each cell can be measured by<br>
passing droplets containing the cells through the cell sorter. By imparting an<br>
electromagnetic charge to droplets containing the stained cells, the transduced cells<br>
can be separated from other cells. The positively selected cells are then harvested in<br>
sterile collection vessels. These cell sorting procedures are described in detail, for<br>
example, in the FACSVantage™ Training Manual, with particular reference to<br>
sections 3-11 to 3-28 and 10-1 to 10-17.<br>
Positive selection of the transduced cells can also be performed using magnetic<br>
separation of cells based on expression or a particular cell surface marker. In such<br>
separation techniques, cells to be positively selected are first contacted with specific<br>
binding agent (e.g., an antibody or reagent the interacts specifically with the cell<br>
surface marker). The cells are then contacted with retrievable particles (e.g.,<br>
magnetically responsive particles) which are coupled with a reagent that binds the<br>
specific binding agent (that has bound to the positive cells). The cell-binding agent-<br>
particle complex can then be physically separated from non-labeled cells, for example<br>
using a magnetic field. When using magnetically responsive particles, the labeled cells<br>
can be retailed in a container using a magnetic filed while the negative cells are<br>
removed. These and similar separation procedures are known to those of ordinary skill<br>
in the art.<br>
Expression of the vector in the selected transduced cells can be assessed by a<br>
number of assays known to those skilled in the art. For example, Western blot or<br>
Northern analysis can be employed depending on the nature of the inserted nucleotide<br>
sequence of interest. Once expression has been established and the transformed T cells<br>
have been tested for the presence of the selected synthetic expression cassette, they are<br>
ready for infusion into a patient via the peripheral blood stream.<br>
The invention includes a kit for genetic modification of an ex viva population of<br>
primary mammalian cells. The kit typically contains a gene transfer vector coding for<br>
at least one selectable marker and at least one synthetic expression cassette contained<br>
in one or more containers, ancillary reagents or hardware, and instructions for use of<br>
the kit.<br>
2.4.3 Further Delivery regimes<br>
Any of the polynucleotides (e.g., expression cassettes) or polypeptides<br>
described herein (delivered by any of the methods described above) can also be used in<br>
combination with other DNA delivery systems and/or protein delivery systems. Non-<br>
limiting examples include co-administration of these molecules, for example, in prime-<br>
boost methods where one or more molecules are delivered in a "priming" step and,<br>
subsequently, one or more molecules are delivered in a "boosting" step. In certain<br>
embodiments, the delivery of one or more nucleic acid-containing compositions and is<br>
followed by delivery of one or more nucleic acid-containing compositions and/or one<br>
or more polypeptide-containing compositions (e.g., polypeptides comprising HIV<br>
antigens). In other embodiments, multiple nucleic acid "primes" (of the same or<br>
different nucleic acid molecules) can be followed by multiple polypeptide "boosts" (of<br>
the same or different poh/peptides). Other examples include multiple nucleic acid<br>
administrations and multiple polypeptide administrations.<br>
In any method involving co-administration, the various compositions can be<br>
delivered in any order. Thus, in embodiments including delivery of multiple different<br>
compositions or molecules, the nucleic acids need not be all delivered before the<br>
polypeptides. For example, the priming step may include delivery of one or more<br>
polypeptides and the boosting comprises delivery of one or more nucleic acids and/or<br>
one more polypeptides. Multiple polypeptide administrations can be followed by<br>
multiple nucleic acid administrations or polypeptide and nucleic acid administrations<br>
can be performed in any order. In any of the embodiments described herein, the<br>
nucleic acid molecules can encode all, some or none of the polypeptides. Thus, one or<br>
more or the nucleic acid molecules (e.g., expression cassettes) described herein and/or<br>
one or more of the polypeptides described herein can be co-administered in any order<br>
and via any administration routes. Therefore, any combination of polynucleotides<br>
and/or polypeptides described herein can be used to generate elicit an immune<br>
reaction.<br>
3.0 Improved HIV-1 Gag and Pol expression cassettes<br>
While not desiring to be bound by any particular model, theory, or hypothesis,<br>
the following information is presented to provide a more complete understanding of<br>
the present invention.<br>
The world health organization (WHO) estimated the number of people<br>
worldwide that are infected with HIV-1 to exceed 36.1 million. The development of a<br>
safe and effective HIV vaccine is therefore essential at this time. Recent studies have<br>
demonstrated the importance of CTL in controlling the HIV-1 replication in infected<br>
patients. Furthermore, CTL reactivity with multiple HIV antigens will be necessary for<br>
the effective control of virus replication. Experiments performed in support of the<br>
present invention suggest that the inclusion of HIV-1 Gag and Pol, beside Env for the<br>
induction of neutralizing antibodies, into the vaccine is useful.<br>
To increase the potency of HIV-1 vaccine candidates, codon modified Gag and<br>
Pol expression cassettes were designed, either for Gag atone or Gag plus PoL To<br>
evaluate possible differences in expression and potency, the expression of these<br>
constructs was analyzed and immunogenicity studies carried out in mice.<br>
Several expression cassettes encoding Gag and Pol were designed, including,<br>
but not limited to, the following: GagProtease, GagPolAintegrase with frameshift<br>
(gagFSpol), and GagPolAintegrase in-frame (gagpol). Versions of GagPolAintegrase<br>
in-frame were also designed with attenuated (Att) or non-functional Protease (Ina).<br>
The nucleic acid sequences were codon modified to correspond to the codon usage of<br>
highly expressed human genes. Mice were immunized with titrated DNA doses and<br>
humoral and cellular immune responses evaluated by ELISA and intracellular cytokine<br>
staining (Example 10).<br>
The immune responses in mice has been seen to be correlated with relative<br>
levels of expression in vitro. Vaccine studies in rhesus monkeys will further address<br>
immune responses and expression levels in vivo.<br>
4.0 Enhanced Vaccine Technologies for the Induction of ,<br>
Potent Neutralizing Antibodies and Cellular Immune<br>
Responses Against HIV.<br>
While not desiring to be bound by any particular model, theory, or hypothesis,<br>
the following information is presented to provide a more complete understanding of<br>
the present invention.<br>
Protection against HIV infection will likely require potent and broadly reactive<br>
pre-existing neutralizing antibodies in vaccinated individuals exposed to a virus<br>
challenge. Although cellular immune responses are desirable to control viremia in<br>
those who get infected, protection against infection has not been demonstrated for<br>
vaccine approaches that rely exclusively on the induction of these responses. For this<br>
reason, experiments performed in support of the present invention use prime-boost<br>
approaches that employ novel V-deleted envelope antigens from primary HIV isolates<br>
(e.g., R5 subtype B (HIV-1SF162) and subtype C (HIV-1TVI strains). These antigens<br>
were delivered by enhanced DNA [polyactide co-glycolide (PLG) microparticle<br>
formulations or electroporation] or alphavirus replicon particle-based vaccine<br>
approaches, followed by booster immunizations with Env proteins in MF59 adjuvant.<br>
Efficient in vivo expression of plasnnd encoded genes by electrical permeabilization<br>
has been described (see, e.g., Zucchelli et al. (2000) J. Virol 74:11598-11607; Banga<br>
et al., (1998) Trends Biotechnol. 10:408-412; Heller et al. (1996) Febs Lett. 389:225-<br>
228; Mathiesen et al. (1999) Gene Ther. 4:508-514; Mir et al. (1999) Proc. Nat lAcad<br>
Sci. USA 8:4262-4267; Nishi et al. (1996) Cancer Res. 5:1050-1055). Both native<br>
and V-deleted monomeric (gp120) and oligomeric (o-gpl40) forms of protein from the<br>
SF162 strain were tested as boosters. All protein preparations were highly purified<br>
and extensively characterized by biophysical and immunochemical methodologies.<br>
Results from rabbit and primate immunogenicity studies indicated that, whereas<br>
neutralizing antibody responses could be consistently induced against the parental non-<br>
V2-deteted SF162 virus, the induction of responses against heterologous HIV strains<br>
improved with deletion of the V2 loop of the immunogens. Moreover, using these<br>
prime-boost vaccine regimens, potent HIV antigen-specific CD4 + and CD8+ T-cell<br>
responses were also demonstrated.<br>
Based on these findings, V2-deleted envelope DNA and protein vaccines were<br>
chosen for advancement toward clinical evaluation. Similar approaches for<br>
immunization may be employed using, for example, nucleic acid immunization<br>
employing the synthetic HIV polynucleotides of the present invention coupled with<br>
corresponding or heterologous HIV-derived polypeptide boosts.<br>
One embodiment of this aspect of the present invention may be described<br>
generally as follows. Antigens are selected for the vaccine composition(s). Env<br>
polypeptides are typically employed in a first antigenic composition used to induce an<br>
immune response. Further, Gag polypeptides are typically employed in a second<br>
antigenic composition used to induce an immune response. The second antigenic<br>
composition may include further HIV-derived polypeptide sequences, including, but<br>
not limited to, Pol, Tat, Rev, Nef, Vif, Vpr, and/or Vpu sequences. A DNA prime<br>
vaccination is typically performed with the first and second antigenic compositions.<br>
Further DNA vaccinations with one of more of the antigenic compositions may also be<br>
included at selected time intervals. The prime is typically followed by at least one<br>
boost. The boost may, for example, include adjuvanted HIV-derived polypeptides<br>
(e.g., corresponding to those used for the DNA vaccinations), coding sequences for<br>
HIV-derived polypeptides (e.g., corresponding to those used for the DNA<br>
vaccinations) encoded by a viral vector, further DNA vaccinations, and/or<br>
combinations of the foregoing. In one embodiment, a DNA prime is administered with<br>
a first antigenic composition (e.g., a DNA construct encoding an Envelope<br>
polypeptide) and second antigenic composition (e.g., a DNA construct encoding a Gag<br>
polypeptide, a Pol polypeptide, a Tat polypeptide, a Nef polypeptide, and a Rev<br>
polypeptide). The DNA construct for use in the prime may, for example, comprise a<br>
CMV promoter operabh/ linked to the polynucleotide encoding the polypeptide<br>
sequence. The DNA prime is foDowed by a boost, for example, an adjuvanted<br>
Envelope polypeptide boost and a viral vector boost (where the viral vector encodes,<br>
e.g., a Gag polypeptide, a Pol polypeptide, a Tat polypeptide, a Nef polypeptide, and a<br>
Rev polypeptide). Alternately (or in addition), the boost may be an adjuvanted Gag<br>
polypeptide, Pol polypeptide, Tat polypeptide, Nef polypeptide, and Rev polypeptide<br>
boost and a viral vector boost (where the viral vector encodes, e.g., an Envelope<br>
polypeptide). The boost may include all polypeptide antigens which were encoded in<br>
the DNA prime; however, this is not required. Further, different polypeptide antigens<br>
may be used in the boost relative to the initial vaccination and visa versa. Further, the<br>
initial vaccination may be a viral vector rather than a DNA construct.<br>
Some factors that may be considered in HIV envelope vaccine design are as<br>
follows. Envelope-based vaccines have demonstrated protection against infection in<br>
non-human primate models. Passive antibody studies have demonstrated protection<br>
against HIV infection in the presence of neutralizing antibodies against the virus<br>
challenge stock. Vaccines that exclude Env generally confer less protective efficacy.<br>
Experiments performed in support of the present invention have demonstrated that<br>
monomeric gpl20 protein-derived from the SF2 lab strain provided neutralization of<br>
HIV-1 lab strains and protection against virus challenges in primate models. Primary<br>
gpl20 protein derived from Thai E field strains provided cross-subtype neutralization<br>
oflab strains. Primary sub-type B o%orneric o-gpl40 protein provided partial<br>
neutralization of subtype B primary (field) isolates. Primary sub-type B o-gp140AV2<br>
DNA prime plus protein boost provided potent neutralization of diverse subtype B<br>
primary isolates and protection against virus challenge in primate models. Primary<br>
sub-type C o-gp140 and o-gp140AV2 likely provide similar results to those just<br>
described for sub-type B.<br>
Vaccine strategies for induction of potent, broadly reactive, neutralizing<br>
antibodies may be assisted by construction of Envelope polypeptide structures that<br>
expose conserved neutralizing epitopes, for example, variable-region deletions and de-<br>
glycosylations, envelope protete-receptor complexes, rational design based on crystal<br>
structure (e.g., ß-sheet deletions), and gp41-fusion domain based immunogens.<br>
Stable CHO cell lines for envelope protein production have been developed<br>
using optimized envelope polypeptide coding sequences, including, but not limited to,<br>
the following: gp120, o-gp140, gp120?V2, o-gp140?V2, gp120?V1V2, o-<br>
gp140?V1V2.<br>
In addition, following prime-boost regimes (such as those described above)<br>
appear to be beneficial to help reduce viral load in infected subjects, as well as possibly<br>
slow or prevent progression of HIV-related disease (relative to untreated subjects).<br>
Exemplary antigenk compositions and immunogenicity studies are presented in<br>
Examples 9,10, 11, and 12.<br>
Experimental<br>
Below are examples of specific embodiments for carrying out the present<br>
invention. The examples are offered for illustrative purposes only, and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the present invention in any way.<br>
Efforts have been made to ensure accuracy with respect to numbers used (e.g.,<br>
amounts, temperatures, etc.), but some experimental error and deviation should, of<br>
course, be allowed for.<br>
Example 1<br>
Generation of Synthetic Expression Cassettes<br>
A;. Generating Synthesis Polynucleotides<br>
The polynucleotide sequences of the present invention were manipulated to<br>
maximize expression of their gene products. The order of the following steps may<br>
vary.<br>
First, the HIV-1 codon usage pattern was modified so that the resulting nucleic<br>
acid coding sequence was comparable to codon usage found in highly expressed<br>
human genes. The HIV codon usage reflects a high content of the nucleotides A or T<br>
of the codon-triplet. The effect of the HIV-1 codon usage is a high AT content in the<br>
DNA sequence that results in a high AU content in the RNA and in a decreased<br>
translation ability and instability of the mRNA. In comparison, highly expressed<br>
human codons prefer the nucleotides G or C. The wild-type sequences were modified<br>
to be comparable to codonusage found in highly expressed human genes.<br>
Second, for some genes non-functional variants were created. In the following<br>
table (Table B) mutations affecting the activity of several HIV genes are disclosed.<br>
Constructs comprising some of these mutations are described herein. Vif, vpr<br>
and vpu synthetic constructs are described. Reducing or eliminating the function of<br>
the associated gene products can be accomplished employing the teachings set forth in<br>
the above table, in view of the teachings of the present specification.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the fall length coding region of the Gag-<br>
polymerase sequence is included with the synthetic Gag sequences in order to increase<br>
the number of epitopes for virus-like particles expressed by the synthetic, optimized<br>
Gag expression cassette. Because synthetic HIV-1 Gag-polymerase expresses the<br>
potentially deleterious functional enzymes reverse transcriptase (RT) and integrase<br>
(INT) (in addition to the structural proteins and protease), it is important to inactivate<br>
RT and INT functions. Several in-frame deletions in the RT and INT reading frame<br>
can be made to achieve catalytic nonfunctional enzymes with respect to their RT and<br>
INT activity. {Jay. A. Levy (Editor) (1995) The Retroviridae, Plenum Press, New<br>

Furthermore selected B- and/or T-cell epitopes can be added to the Gag-<br>
polymerase constructs within the deletions of the RT- and INT-coding sequence to<br>
replace and augment any epitopes deleted by the functional modifications of RT and<br>
INT. Alternately, selected B- and T-cell epitopes (including CTL epitopes) from RT<br>
and INT can be included in a minimal VLP formed by expression of the synthetic Gag<br>
or synthetic GagProt cassette, described above. (For descriptions of known HIV B-<br>
and T-cell epitopes see, HIV Molecular Immunology Database CTL Search Interface;<br>

In another aspect, the present invention comprises Env coding sequences that<br>
include, but are not limited to, polynucleotide sequences encoding the following HIV-<br>
encoded polypeptides: gpl60, gpl40, and gpl20 (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,792,459<br>
for a description of the HIV-1SF2 ("SF2") Env polypeptide). The relationships between<br>
these polypeptides is shown schematically in Figure 3 (in the figure: the polypeptides<br>
are indicated as lines, the amino and carboxy termini are indicated on the gpl60 line;<br>
the open circle represents the oligomerization domain; the open square represents a<br>
transmembrane spanning domain (TM); and "c" represents the location of a cleavage<br>
site, in gpl40.mut the "X" indicates that the cleavage site has been mutated such that it<br>
no longer functions as a cleavage site). The polypeptide gp16O includes the coding<br>
sequences for gp12O and gp41. The polypeptide gp41 is comprised of several domains<br>
including an oligomerization domain (OD) and a transmembrane spanning domain<br>
(TM). In the native envelope, the oligomerization domain is required for the non-<br>
covalent association of three gp41 polypeptides to form a trimeric structure: through<br>
non-covalent interactions with the gp41 trimer (and itself), the gpl20 polypeptides are<br>
also organized in a trimeric structure. A cleavage site (or cleavage sites) exists<br>
approximately between the polypeptide sequences for gp120 and the polypeptide<br>
sequences corresponding to gp41. This cleavage site(s) can be mutated to prevent<br>
cleavage at the site. The resulting gp140 polypeptide corresponds to a truncated form<br>
of gp160 where the transmembrane spanning domain of gp41 has been deleted. This<br>
gp140 polypeptide can exist in both monomeric and oligomeric (i.e. trimeric) forms by<br>
virtue of the presence of the oligomerization domain in the gp41 moiety. In the<br>
situation where the cleavage site has been mutated to prevent cleavage and the<br>
transmembrane portion of gp41 has been deleted the resulting polypeptide product is<br>
designated "mutated" gp140 (e.g., gpl40.mut). As will be apparent to those in the<br>
field, the cleavage site can be mutated in a variety of ways. (See, also, WO 00/39302).<br>
Wild-type HIV coding sequences (e.g.. Gag, Env, Pol, tat, rev, nef, vpr, vpu,<br>
vif, etc.) can be selected from any known HIV isolate and these sequences<br>
manipulated to maximize expression of their gene products following the teachings of<br>
the present invention. The wild-type coding region maybe modified in one or more of<br>
the following ways. In one embodiment, sequences encoding hypervariabte regions of<br>
Env, particularly VI and/or V2 were deleted. In other embodiments, mutations were<br>
introduced into sequences, for example, encoding the cleavage site in Env to abrogate<br>
the enzymatic cleavage of oligomeric gp140<br>
into gpl20 monomers. (See, e.g., Earl et al. (1990) PNAS USA 87:648-652; Earl et al.<br>
(1991) J. ViroL 65:31-41). In yet other embodiments, hypervariable region(s) were<br>
deleted, N-glycosylation sites were removed and/or cleavage sites mutated. As<br>
discussed above, different mutations may be introduced into the coding sequences of<br>
different genes (see, e.g., Table B). For example, Tat coding sequences were modified<br>
according to the teachings of the present specification, for example to affect the<br>
transactivation domain of the gene product (e.g., replacing a cystein residue at position<br>
22 with a glycine, Caputo et al., (1996) Gene Therapy 3:235).<br>
To create the synthetic coding sequences of the present invention the gene<br>
cassettes are designed to comprise the entire coding sequence of interest. Synthetic<br>
gene cassettes are constructed by oligonucleotide synthesis and PCR amplification to<br>
generate gene fragments. Primers are chosen to provide convenient restriction sites<br>
for subcloning. The resulting fragments are then ligated to create the entire desired<br>
sequence which is then cloned into an appropriate vector. The final synthetic<br>
sequences are (i) screened by restriction endonuclease digestion and analysis,(ii)<br>
subjected to DNA sequencing in order to confirm that the desired sequence has been<br>
obtained and (iii) the identity and integrity of the expressed protein confirmed by SDS-<br>
PAGE and Western blotting. The synthetic coding sequences are assembled at Chiron<br>
Corp. (Emeryville, CA) or by the Midland Certified Reagent Company (Midland,<br>
Texas).<br>
Percent identity to the synthetic sequences of the present invention can be<br>
determined, for example, using the Smith-Waterman search algorithm (Time Logic,<br>
Incline Village, NV), with the following exemplary parameters: weight matrix =<br>
nuc4x4bb; gap opening penalty = 20, gap extension penalty = 5, reporting threshold =<br>
1; alignment threshold = 20.<br>
Various forms of the different embodiments of the present invention (e.g.,<br>
constructs) may be combined.<br>
Exemplary embodiments of the synthetic polynucleotides of the present<br>
invention include, but are not limited to, the sequences presented in Table C.<br>
B. Creating Expression Cassettes Comprising the Synthetic Polynucleotides of the<br>
Present Invention<br>
The synthetic DNA fragments of the present invention are cloned into the<br>
following expression vectors: pCMVKm2, for transient expression assays and DNA<br>
immunization studies, the pCMVKm2 vector was derived from pCMV6a (Chapman et<br>
a]., Nuc. Acids Res. (1991) 12:3979-3986) and comprises a kanamycin selectable<br>
marker, a CoIEl origin of replication, a CMV promoter enhancer and Intron A,<br>
followed by an insertion site for the synthetic sequences described below followed by a<br>
polyadenylation signal derived from bovine growth hormone — the pCMVKm2 vector<br>
differs from the pCMV-link vector only m mat a polylinker site was inserted into<br>
pCMVKm2 to generate pCMV-link; pESN2dhfr and pCMVPLEdhfr (also known as<br>
pCMVIII), for expression in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells; and, pAcC13, a<br>
shuttle vector for use in the Baculovirus expression system (pAcC13, was derived<br>
from pAcC12 which was described by Munemitsu S., et al., Mol Cell BioL<br>
10(11):5977-5982,1990). See, also co-owned WO 00/39302, WO 00/39303, WO<br>
00/39304, WO 02/04493 for a description of these vectors.<br>
Briefly, construction of pCMVPLEdhfr (pCMVIII) was as follows. To<br>
construct a DHFR cassette, the EMCV IRES (internal ribosome entry site) leader was<br>
PCR-amplified from pCite-4a+ (Novagen, Inc., Milwaukee, WI) and inserted into<br>
pET-23d (Novagen, Inc., Milwaukee, WI) as an Xba-Nco fragment to give pET-<br>
EMCV. The dhfr gene was PCR-amplified from pESN2dhfr to give a product with a<br>
Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser spacer in place of the translation stop codon and inserted as an Nco-<br>
BamH1 fragment to give pET-E-DHFR. Next, the attenuated neo gene was PCR<br>
amplified from a pSV2Neo (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) derivative and inserted into the<br>
unique BamH1 site of pET-E-DHFR to give pET-E-DHFR/Neo(m2). Then, the bovine<br>
growth hormone terminator frompCDNA3 (Invitrogen, Inc., Carlsbad, CA) was<br>
inserted downstream of the neo gene to give pET-E-DHFR/Neo(m2)BGHt The<br>
BMCV-dhfr/neo selectable marker cassette fragment was prepared by cleavage of<br>
pET-E-DHFR/Neo(m2)BGHt. The CMV enhancer/promoter plus Intron A was<br>
transferred from pCMV6a (Chapman et al., Nuc. Acids Res. (1991) 19:3979-3986) as<br>
a HindIII-Sall fragment into pUC19 (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA). The<br>
vector backbone of pUC19 was deleted from the Ndel to the Sapl sites. The above<br>
described DHFR cassette was added to the construct such that the EMCV IRES<br>
followed the CMV promoter to produce the final construct. The vector also contained<br>
an amp' gene and an SV40 origin of replication.<br>
Expression vectors of the present invention contain one or more of the<br>
synthetic coding sequences disclosed herein, e.g., shown in the Figures. When the<br>
expression cassette contains more than one coding sequence the coding sequences may<br>
all be in-frame to generate one polyprotein; alternately, the more than one polypeptide<br>
coding sequences may comprise a polycistronie message where, for example, an IRES<br>
is placed 5" to each polypeptide coding sequence.<br>
Example 9,<br>
Expression Assays for the<br>
Synthetic Coding Sequences<br>
The wild-type sequences are cloned into expression vectors having the same<br>
features as the vectors into which the synthetic HIV-derived sequences were cloned.<br>
Expression efficiencies for various vectors carrying the wild-type (any known<br>
isolated) and corresponding synthetic sequence(s) are evaluated as follows. Cells from<br>
several mammalian cell lines (293, RD, COS-7, and CHO; all obtained from the<br>
American Type Culture Collection, 10801 University Boulevard, Manassas, VA<br>
20110-2209) are transfected with 2 ug of DNA m transfection reagent LT1 (Pan Vera<br>
Corporation, 545 Science Dr., Madison, WI). The cells are incubated for 5 hours in<br>
reduced serum medium (Opti-MEM, Gibco-BRL, Gaithersburg, MD). The medium is<br>
then replaced with normal medium as follows: 293 cells, IMDM, 10% fetal calf serum,<br>
2% ghitamine (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD); RD and COS-7 cells, D-MEM, 10%<br>
fetal calf serum, 2% glutamine (Opti-MEM, Gibco-BRL, Gaithersburg, MD); and<br>
CHO cells, Ham's F-12,10% fetal calf serum, 2% gluitamine (Opti-MEM, Gibco-BRL,<br>
Gaithersburg, MD). The cells are incubated for either 48 or 60 hours. Supernatants<br>
are harvested and filtered through 0.45 µm syringe filters and, optionally, stored at -<br>
20°C.<br>
Supernatants are evaluated using the Coulter p24-assay (Coulter Corporation,<br>
Hialeah, FL, US), using 96-well plates coated with a suitable monoclonal antibody<br>
directed against an HIV antigen (e.g. a murine monoclonal directed again an HIV core<br>
antigen). The appropriate HIV antigen binds to the coated wells and biotinylated<br>
antibodies against HIV recognize the bound antigen. Conjugated strepavidin-<br>
horseradish peroxidase reacts with the biotin. Color develops from the reaction of<br>
peroxidase with TMB substrate. The reaction is terminated by addition of 4N H2SO4.<br>
The intensity of the color is directly proportional to the amount of HIV antigen in a<br>
sample.<br>
Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are also transfected with plasmid DNA<br>
encoding the synthetic HIVpolypeptides described herein (e.g., pESN2dhfr or<br>
pCMVm vector backbone) using Minis TransIT-LT1 polyamine transfection reagent<br>
(Pan Vera) according to the manufacturers instructions and incubated for 96 hours.<br>
After 96 hours, media is changed to selective media (F12 special with 250 µg/ml<br>
G418) and cells are split 1:5 and incubated for an additional 48 hours. Media is<br>
changed every 5-7 days until colonies start forming at which time the colonies are<br>
picked, plated into 96 well plates and screened by Capture ELISA. Positive clones are<br>
expanded in 24 well plates and are screened several times for HIV protein production<br>
by Capture ELISA, as described above. After reaching confluency in 24 well plates,<br>
positive clones are expanded to T25 flasks (Corning, Corning, NY). These are<br>
screened several times after confluency and positive clones are expanded to T75 flasks.<br>
Positive T75 clones are frozen in LN2 and the highest expressing clones are<br>
amplified with 0-5 µM methotrexate (MTX)at several concentrations and plated in<br>
100mm culture dishes. Plates are screened for colony formation and all positive closed<br>
are again expanded as described above. Clones are expanded an amplified and<br>
screened at each step capture ELISA. Positive clones are frozen at each methotrexate<br>
level. Highest producing clones are grown in perfusion bioreactors (3L, 100L) for<br>
expansion and adaptation to low serum suspension culture conditions for scale-up to<br>
larger bioreactors.<br>
Data from experiments performed in support of the present invention show that<br>
the synthetic HIV expression cassettes provided dramatic increases in production of<br>
their protein products, relative to the native (wild-type) sequences, when expressed in<br>
a variety of cell lines and mat stably transfected CHO cell lines, which express the<br>
desired HIVpolypeptide(s), may be produced. Production of HIV polypeptides using<br>
CHO cells provides (i) correct glycosylation patterns and protein conformation (as<br>
determined by binding to panel of MAbs); (ii) correct binding to CD4 receptor<br>
molecules; (iii) absence of non-mammalian cell contaminants (e.g., insect viruses<br>
and/or cells); and (iv) ease of purification.<br>
Example 3<br>
Western Blot Analysis of Expression<br>
Western blot analysis of cells transfected with the HIV expression cassettes<br>
described herein are performed essentially as described in co-owned WO 00/39302.<br>
Briefly, human 293 cells are transfected as described in Example 2 with pCMV6a-<br>
based vectors containing native or synthetic HIV expression cassettes. Cells are<br>
cultivated for 60 hours post-transfection. Supernatants are prepared as described.<br>
Cell lysates are prepared as follows. The cells are washed once with phosphate-<br>
buffered saline, lysed with detergent [1% NP40 (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO)<br>
in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5], and the lysate transferred into fresh tubes. SDS-<br>
polyacrylamide gels (pre-cast 8-16%; Novex, San Diego, CA) are loaded with 20 µl of<br>
supernatant or 12.5 µl of cell lysate. A protein standard is also loaded (5 µl, broad<br>
size range standard; BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Electrophoresis is carried<br>
out and the proteins are transferred using a BioRad Transfer Chamber (BioRad<br>
Laboratories, Hercules, CA) to Immobilon P membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford,<br>
MA) using the transfer buffer recommended by the manufacturer (Millipore), where<br>
the transfer is performed at 100 volts for 90 minutes. The membranes are exposed to<br>
HIV-1-positive human patient serum and immunostained using o-phenylenediamine<br>
dihydrochloride (OPD; Sigma).<br>
The results of the immunoblotting analysis are used to show that cells<br>
containing the synthetic HIV expression cassette produce the expected HIV-<br>
polypeptide(s) at higher per-cell concentrations than cells containing the native<br>
expression cassette.<br>
In vivo Immunogenicitv of Synthetic HIV Expression Cassettes<br>
A. Immunization<br>
To evaluate the immunogenicity of the synthetic HIV expression cassettes, a<br>
moose study may be performed. The plasmid DNA, e.g., pCMVKM2 carrying an<br>
expression cassette comprising a synthetic sequence of the present invention, is dilated<br>
to the following final concentrations in a total injection volume of 100 µl: 20 µg, 2 µg,<br>
0.2 µg, and 0.02 µg. To overcome possible negative dilution effects of the dilated<br>
DNA, the total DNA concentration in each sample is brought up to 20 µg using the<br>
vector (pCMVKM2) alone. As a control, plasmid DNA comprising an expression<br>
cassette encoding the native, corresponding polypeptide is handled in the same manner.<br>
Twelve groups of four Balb/c mice (Charles River, Boston, MA) are intramuscularly<br>
immunized (SO ul per leg, intramuscular injection into the tibialis anterior) using<br>
varying dosages.<br>
B. Humoral Immune Response<br>
The humoral immune response is checked with a suitable anti-HIV antibody<br>
ELISAs (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays) of the mice sera 0 and 4 weeks post<br>
immunization (groups 5-12) and, in addition, 6 and 8 weeks post immunization,<br>
respectively, 2 and 4 weeks post second immunization (groups 1-4).<br>
The antibody titers of the sera are determined by anti-HIV antibody BUS A.<br>
Briefly, sera from immunized mice were screened for antibodies directed against an<br>
appropriate HIV protein (e.g., HIV p55 for Gag). ELISA microtiter plates are coated<br>
with 0.2 µg of HIV protein per well overnight and washed four times; subsequently,<br>
blocking is done with PBS-0.2% Tween (Sigma) for 2 hours. After removal of the<br>
blocking solution, 100 ul of diluted mouse serum is added. Sera are tested at 1/25<br>
dilutions and by serial 3-fold dilutions, thereafter. Microtiter plates are washed four<br>
times and incubated with a secondary, peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse IgG antibody<br>
(Pierce, Rockford, IL). EUSA plates are washed and 100 µl of 3, 3', 5, 5-tetramethyl<br>
benzidine (TMB; Pierce) was added per well The optical density of each well is<br>
measured after 15 minutes. The titers reported are the reciprocal of the dilution of<br>
serum that gave a half-maximumum optical density (O.D.).<br>
The results of the moose immunizations with plasmid-DNAs are used to show<br>
that the synthetic expression cassettes provide improvement of immunogenicity<br>
relative to the native expression cassettes. Also, the second boost immunization<br>
induces a secondary immune response after two weeks (groups 1-3).<br>
The frequency of specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) is evaluated by a<br>
standard chromium release assay of peptide pulsed Balb/c mouse CD4 cells. HIV<br>
protein-expressing vaccinia virus infected CD-8 cells are used as a positive control (w-<br>
protein). Briefly, spleen cells (Effector cells, E) are obtained from the BALB/c mice<br>
(immunized as described above). The cells are cultured, restimulated, and assayed for<br>
CTL activity against, e.g., Gag peptide-puked target cells as described (Doe, B., and<br>
Walker, CM., AIDS 10(7):793-794,1996). Cytotoxic activity is measured in a<br>
standard 51Cr release assay. Target (T) cells are cultured with effector (E) cells at<br>
various E:T ratios for 4 hoars and the average cpm from duplicate wells is used to<br>
calculate percent specific 51Cr release.<br>
Cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) activity is measured in splenocytes recovered from the<br>
mice immunized with HIV DNA constructs described herein. Effector cells from the<br>
DNA-immunized animals exhibit specific lysis of HIV peptide-pulsed SV-BALB<br>
(MHC matched) targets cells indicative of a CTL response. Target cells that are<br>
peptide-pulsed and derived from an MHC-unmatched mouse strain (MC57) are not<br>
lysed. The results of the CTL assays are used to show increased potency of synthetic HIV<br>
expression cassettes for induction of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses by<br>
DNA immunization.<br>
Example 5<br>
In Vivo Immunogenicitv of Synthetic HIV Expression Cassettes<br>
A- General Immunization Methods<br>
To evaluate the immunogenicity of the synthetic HIV expression cassettes,<br>
studies using guinea pigs, rabbits, mice, rhesus macaques and baboons are performed.<br>
The studies are typically structured as follows: DNA immunization alone (single or<br>
multiple); DNA immunization followed by protein immunization (boost); DNA<br>
immunization followed by Sindbis particle immunization; immunization by Sindbis<br>
particles alone.<br>
B. Guinea Pies<br>
Experiments may be performed in guinea pigs as follows. Groups comprising<br>
six guinea pigs each are immunized intramuscularly or mucosally at 0,4, and 12 weeks<br>
with plasmid DNAs encoding expression cassettes comprising one or more the<br>
sequences described herein. The animals are subsequently boosted at approximately<br>
18 weeks with a single dose (intramuscular, intradermally or mucosally) of the HIV<br>
protein encoded by the sequence(s) of the plasmid boost and/or other HIV proteins.<br>
Antibody titers (geometric mean titers) are measured at two weeks following the third<br>
DNA immunization and at two weeks after the protein boost. These results are used<br>
to demonstrate the usefulness of the synthetic constructs to generate immune<br>
responses, as well as, the advantage of providing a protein boost to enhance the<br>
immune response following DNA immunization.<br>
C. Rabbits<br>
Experiments may be performed in rabbits as follows. Rabbits are immunized<br>
intramuscularly, mucosally, or intradermally (using a Bioject needless syringe) with<br>
plasmid DNAs encoding the HIV proteins described herein. The nucleic acid<br>
immunizations are followed by protein boosting after the initial immunization.<br>
Typically, constructs comprising the synthetic HIV-polypeptide-encoding<br>
polynucleotides of the present invention are highly immunogenic and generate<br>
substantial antigen binding antibody responses after only 2 immunizations in rabbits.<br>
D. Humoral Immune Response<br>
In any immunized animal model, the humoral immune response is checked in<br>
serum specimens from the immunized animals with an anti-HIV antibody ELIS As<br>
(enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays) at various times post-immunization. The<br>
antibody titers of the sera are determined by anti-HIV antibody ELISA as described<br>
above. Briefly, sera from immunized animals are screened for antibodies directed<br>
against the HIV polypeptide/protein(s) encoded by the DNA and/or polypeptide used<br>
to immunize the animals. Wells of ELIS A microtiter plates are coated overnight with<br>
the selected HIVpolypeptide/protem and washed four times; subsequently, blocking is<br>
done with PBS-0.2% Tween (Sigma) for 2 hours. After removal of the blocking<br>
solution, 100 ul of diluted mouse serum is added. Sera are tested at 1/25 dilutions and<br>
by serial 3-fold dilutions, thereafter. Microtiter plates are washed four times and<br>
incubated with a secondary, peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse IgG antibody (Pierce,<br>
Rockford, IL). ELISA plates are washed and 100 ul of 3, 3', 5, S'-tetramethyl<br>
benzidme (TMB; Pierce) was added per well. The optical density of each well is<br>
measured after 15 minutes. Titers are typically reported as the reciprocal of the<br>
dilution of serum that gave a half-maximum optical density (O.D.).<br>
Cellular immune response may also be evaluated.<br>
Example 6<br>
DNA-immunization of Baboons and Rhesus Macaques Using Expression Cassettes<br>
Comprising the Synthetic HIV Polynucleotides of the Present Invention<br>
A. Baboons<br>
Four baboons are immunized 3 times (weeks 0, 4 and 8) bilaterally,<br>
intramuscular into the quadriceps or mucosally using the gene delivery vehicles<br>
described herein. The animals are bled two weeks after each immunization and an HIV<br>
antibody ELISA is performed with isolated plasma The ELISA is performed<br>
essentially as described above except the second antibody-conjugate is an anti-human<br>
IgG, g-chain specific, peroxidase conjugate (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MD<br>
63178) used at a dilution of 1:500. Fifty µg/ml yeast extract may be added to the<br>
dilutions of plasma samples and antibody conjugate to reduce non-specific background<br>
due to preexisting yeast antibodies in the baboons. Lymphoproliferative responses to<br>
are observed in baboons two weeks post-fourth immunization (at week 14), and<br>
enhanced substantially post-boosting with HIV-polypeptide (at week 44 and 76). Such<br>
proliferation results are indicative of induction of T-helper cell functions.<br>
B. Rhesus Macaques<br>
The improved potency of the synthetic, codon-modified HIV-polypeptide<br>
encoding polynucteotides of the present invention, when constructed into expression<br>
plasmids may be confirmed in rhesus macaques. Typically, the macaques have<br>
detectable HIV-specific CTL after two or three 1 mg doses of modified HIV<br>
polynucleotide. In sum, these results demonstrate that the synthetic HIV DNA is<br>
immunogenic in non-human primates. Neutralizing antibodies may also detected.<br>
Exaample 7<br>
Co-Transfection of Monocistronic and Multicistronic Constructs<br>
The present invention includes co-transfection with multiple, monocistronic<br>
expression cassettes, as well as co-transfection with one or more multi-cistronic<br>
expression cassettes, or combinations thereof.<br>
Such constructs, in a variety of combinations, may be transfected into 293T<br>
cells for transient transfection studies.<br>
For example, a bicistronic construct may be made where the coding sequences<br>
for the different HIV polypeptides are under the control of a single CMV promoter<br>
and, between the two coding sequences, an IRES (internal ribosome entry site (EMCV<br>
IRES); Kozak, M., Critical Reviews in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology<br>
27(45):385-402, 1992; Witherell, G.W., et al., Virology 214:660-663, 1995) sequence<br>
is introduced after the first HIV coding sequence and before the second HIV coding<br>
sequence.<br>
Supernatants collected from cell culture are tested for the presence of the HIV<br>
 proteins and indicate that appropriate proteins are expressed in the transfected cells<br>
(e.g., if an Env coding sequence was present the corresponding Env protein was<br>
detected; if a Gag coding sequence was present the corresponding Gag protein was<br>
detected, etc).<br>
The production of chimeric VLPs by these cell lines may be determined using<br>
electron microscopic analysis. (See, e.g., co-owned WO 00/39302).<br>
Example 8<br>
Accessory gene components for an HIV-1 vaccine: functional analysis of mutated Tat,<br>
Rev and Nef Type C antigens<br>
The HIV-1 regulatory and accessory genes have received increased attention as<br>
components of HIV vaccines due to their role in viral pathogenesis, the high ratio of<br>
highly conserved CTL epitopes and their early expression in the viral life cycle.<br>
Because of various undesirable properties of these genes, questions regarding their<br>
safety and suitability as vaccine components have been raised. Experiments performed<br>
in support of the present invention have analyzed candidate HIV-1 subtype C tat, rev,<br>
and nef mutants for efficient expression and inactivation of potential deleterious<br>
functions. Other HIV subtype accessory genes may be evaluated similarly.<br>
Sequence-modified, mutant tat, rev, and nef genes coding for consensus Tat,<br>
Rev and Nef proteins of South African HIV-1 subtype C were constructed using<br>
overlapping synthetic oligonucleotides and PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis.<br>
Constructs of the wild-type genes of the isolates closely resembling the respective<br>
consensus sequences were also made by PCR. In vitro expression of the consiructs<br>
was analyzed by western blotting. The trans-activation activity of the Tat mutants and<br>
nuclear RNA export activity of the Rev mutants were studied after transfection of<br>
various cell lines using reporter-gene-based functionality assays.<br>
In vitro expression of all constructs was demonstrated by western blotting<br>
using antigen specific mouse serum generated by DNA vaccination of mice with Tat,<br>
Rev, or Nef-expression plasmids. Expression levels of the sequence-modified genes<br>
were significantly higher than the wild-type genes.<br>
Subtype B and C Tat cDNA was mutated to get TatC22, TatC37, and<br>
TatC22/37. Tat activity assays in three cell lines (RD, HeLa and 293). In the<br>
background of the subtype C consensus Tat, a single mutation at C22 was insufficient<br>
to inactivate LTR-dependent CAT expression. In contrast, this activity was<br>
significantly impaired in RD, 293 and HeLa cells using the single mutation, C37, or the<br>
double mutation, C22C37 (see Table B). Corresponding results were obtained for Tat<br>
mutants derived from subtype B strains.<br>
Exemplary results are presented in Figure 4 for transactivation activity of Tat<br>
mutants on LTR-CAT plasmid in 293 cells. Three independent assays were performed<br>
for each construct (Figure 4, legend (1), (2), (3)).<br>
The subtype C constructs TatC22ProtRTTatRevNef and<br>
ProtRTTatC22RevNef showed reduced Tat activity when compared to TatC22 alone,<br>
probably due to structural changes caused by the fusion protein.<br>
For Rev constructs, to test for the loss of function, a CAT assay with a<br>
reporter plasmid including native or mutated Rev was used. As shown in Figure 5,<br>
compared to wild-type Rev, the mRNA export function of the subtype C Rev with a<br>
double mutation, M5M10 (see Table B), was significantly lower. The background<br>
levels are shown in the "mock" data and the pDM128 reporter plasmid without Rev<br>
 data. Two independent assays were performed for each construct (Figure 5, legend<br>
(D,(2)).<br>
Assays to measure Nef-specific functions may also be performed (Nef<br>
mutations are described in Table B). For example, FACs analysis is used to look for<br>
the presence of MHC1 and CD4 on cell surfaces. Cells are assayed in the presence<br>
and absence of Nef expression (for controls), as well as using the synthetic<br>
polynucleotides of the present invention that encode native nef protein and mutated nef<br>
protein. Down-regulation of MHCl and CD4 expression indicates that the nef gene<br>
product is not functional, ie., if nef is non-functional there is no down regulation.<br>
These data demonstrate the impaired functionality of tat and rev DNA<br>
immunogens that may form part of a multi-component HIV-1 subtype C vaccine. In<br>
contrast to previous published data by other groups, the C22 mutation did not<br>
sufficiently inactivate the transactivation function of Tat. The C37 mutation appeared<br>
to be required for inactivation of subtype C and subtype B Tat proteins.<br>
Example 9<br>
Evaluation of immunogenicity of various HIV polvpeptide encoding plasmids<br>
As noted above, the immunogenicity of any of the polynucleotides or<br>
expression cassettes described herein is readily evaluated. In the following table (Table<br>
D) are exemplified procedures involving a comparison of the immunogenicity of<br>
subtype B and C envelope plasmids, both individually and as a mixed-subtype vaccine,<br>
using electroporation, in rabbits. It will be apparent that such methods are equally<br>
applicable to any other HIV polypeptide.<br>
The MF59C adjuvant is a microfluidized emulsion containing 5% squalene,<br>
0.5% tween 80, 0.5% span 85, in lOmM citrate pH 6, stored in lOmL aliquots at 4°C.<br>
Lnmunogens are prepared as described in the following table (Table E) for<br>
administration to animals in the various groups. Concentrations may vary from those<br>
described in the table, for example depending on the sequences and/or proteins being<br>
used.<br>
Example 10<br>
Mice Immunization Studies with Gag and Pol Constructs<br>
Cellular and Humoral immune responses were evaluated in mice (essentially as<br>
described in Example 4) for the following constructs: Gag, GagProtease(+FS) (GP1,<br>
protease codon optimized and inactivation of INS; GP2, protease only inactivation of<br>
INS), GagPolAintegrase with frameshift (gagFSpol), and GagPolAintegrase in-frame<br>
(GagPol) (see Figure 91). Versions of GagPolAintegrase in-frame were also designed<br>
with attenuated (GagPolAtt) or non-functional Protease (GagPolIna).<br>
In vitro expression data showed comparable expression of p55Gag and p66RT<br>
using Gag alone, GagProtease(+FS), GagFSpol and GagPolIna. Constructs with fully<br>
functional or attenuated protease (GagPol or GagPolAtt) were less efficient in<br>
expression of p55Gag and p66RT, possibly due to cytotoxic effects of protease.<br>
DNA immunization of mice using Gag vs. GP1 and GP2 in pCMV vectors was<br>
performed intramuscularly in the tibialis anterior. Mice were immunized at the start of<br>
the study (0 week) and 4 weeks later. Bleeds were performed at 0,4, and 6 weeks.<br>
DNA doses used were as follows: 20 fig, 2 ug, 0.2 ug, and 0.02 ug.<br>
DNA immunization of mice using Gag vs. gagFSpol in pCMV vectors was<br>
performed intramuscularly in the tibialis anterior. Mice were immunized at the start of<br>
the study (0 week) and challenged 4 weeks later with recombinant vaccinia virus<br>
encoding Gag (rWgag). Bleeds were performed at 0 and 4 weeks. DNA doses used<br>
were as follows: 20 µg, 2 µg, 0.2 µg, and 0.02 µg.<br>
DNA immanization of mice using Gag vs. gagFSpol and gagpol in pCMV<br>
vectors was performed mtramuscularry in the tibialis anterior. Mice were immunized<br>
at the start of the study (0 week) and challenged 4 weeks later with recombinant<br>
vaccinia virus encoding Gag (rWgag). Bleeds were performed at 0 and 4 weeks.<br>
DNA doses used were as foflows: 2 µg, 0.2 µg, 0.02 µg, and 0.002 µg.<br>
Cellular immune responses against Gag were comparable for all tested variants,<br>
for example, Gag, GagProtease, gagFSpol and GagPolIna all had comparable<br>
potencies.<br>
Humoral immune responses to Gag were also comparable with the exception of<br>
GP2 and especially GP1. Humoral immune responses were weaker in constructs<br>
comprising functional or attenuated proteases which may be due to less efficient<br>
secretion of p55Gag caused by overactive protease.<br>
In vitro and in vivo experiments, performed in support of the present invention,<br>
suggest that the expression and immunogenicity of Gag was comparable with all<br>
constructs. Exceptions were GagPol in-frame with fully functional or attenuated<br>
protease. This may be the result of cytotoxic effects of protease. The immune<br>
response in mice correlated with relative levels of expression in vitro.<br>
Example 11<br>
Protein Expression, Imnuinogenicitv. and Generation of Neutraliyinp; Antibodies Using<br>
Type C Derived Envelope Polypeptides<br>
Envelope (Env) vaccines derived from the subtype C primary isolate, TV1,<br>
recovered from a South African individual, were tested in rabbits as follows. Gene<br>
cassettes were designed to express the gp120 (surface antigen), gp140 (surface antigen<br>
plus ectodomain of transmembrane protein, gp41), and full-length (gp120 plus gp41)<br>
gp160 forms of the HIV-1 envelope polyprotein with and without deletions of the<br>
variable loop regions, V2 and V1V2. An of the genes were sequence-modified to<br>
enhance expression of the encoded Env glycoproteins in a Rev-independent fashion<br>
and they were subsequently cloned into pCMV-based plasmid vectors for DNA<br>
vaccine and protein production applications as described above. The sequences were<br>
codon optimized as described herein. Briefly, all the modified envelope genes were<br>
cloned into the Chiron pCMVlink plasmid vector, preferably into BcoRI/XhoI sites.<br>
A. Protein Expression<br>
Full-length (gp160), truncated gp140 (Env ectodomain only) and gp120 native<br>
versions of the TV1 Env antigen were produced from the expression cassettes<br>
described herein. The gpl40 encoding sequences were transiently transfected into<br>
293T cells. The expression levels of the gene products were evaluated by an in-house<br>
antigen capture ELISA. Envelope genes constructed from the native sequences of<br>
TV001c8.2, TV001c8.5 and TV002cl2.1 expressed the correct proteins in vitro, with<br>
gpl40TV001c8.2 exhibiting the highest level of expression. In addition, the Env<br>
protein expressed from the TV1-derived clone 8.2 was found to bind the CD4 receptor<br>
protein indicating that this feature of the expressed protein is maintained in a functional<br>
conformation. The receptor binding properties/functionality of the expressed TV1<br>
gp160 protein result was also confirmed by a cell-fusion assay.<br>
Total expression increased approximately 10-fold for synthetic gpl40<br>
constructs compared with the native gp140 gene cassettes. Both the modified gp 120<br>
and gp140 variants secreted high amounts of protein in the supernatant. In addition,<br>
the V2 and VIV2 deleted forms of gp140 expressed approximately 2-fold more<br>
protein than the intact gpl40. Overall, the expression levels of synthetic gpl40 gene<br>
variants increased 10 to 26-fold compared with the gp140 gene with native sequences.<br>
In sum, each synthetic construct tested showed more than 10-fold increased<br>
levels of expression relative to those using the native coding sequences. Moreover, all<br>
expressed proteins were of the expected molecular weights and were shown to bind<br>
CD4. Stable CHO cell lines were derived and small-scale protein purification methods<br>
were used to produce small quantities of each of the undeleted and V-deleted<br>
oligoraeric forms (o-gpl40) of these proteins for vaccine studies.<br>
B. Neutralization properties of TV001 and TV002 viral isolates<br>
The transient expression experiment showed that the envelope genes derived<br>
from the TV001 and TV002 virus isolates expressed the desired protein products.<br>
Relative neutralization sensitivities of these two viral strains using sera from 18<br>
infected South African individuals (subtypes B and C) were as follows. At a 1:10<br>
serum dilution, the TV2 strain was neutralized by 18 of 18 sera; at 1:50,16 of 18; at<br>
1:250,15/18. In comparison, the TV1 isolate was neutralized by 15 of 18 at 1:10;<br>
only 6 of 18 at 1:50; and none of the specimens at 1:250. In addition, the TV001<br>
patient serum showed neutralization activity against the TV002 isolate at all dilutions<br>
tested. In contrast, the TV002 showed neutralization of TV001 only at the 1:10 serum<br>
dilution. These results suggest that TV001 isolate is capable of inducing a broader and<br>
more potent neutralizing antibody response in its infected host than TV002.<br>
C Immunogenicity of the modified TV1 Env DNA and protein antigens in<br>
rabbit studies<br>
TV1 Env DNA (comprising the synthetic expression cassettes) and protein<br>
vaccines were administrated as shown in the following Table H.<br>
Seven groups of 4 rabbits per group were immunized with the designated<br>
plasmid DNA and oligomeric Env protein antigens. Three doses of DNA, 1 nig of<br>
DNA per animal per immunization, were administrated intramuscularly by needle<br>
injection followed by electroporation on weeks 0,4, and 20 weeks. A single dose of<br>
100 ug of Env protein in MF59 adjuvant also was given intramuscularly in a separate<br>
site at 20 weeks.<br>
The DNA immunization used subtype C sequence-modified genes (TV1) --<br>
gpl60, gp160dV2, gp160dV1V2, gpl40, gp140dV2 and gp140dV1V2 ~ as well as a<br>
subtype B SF162 sequence modified gp140dV2. DNA immunizations were<br>
performed at 0,4, and 20 weeks by needle injection by the intramuscular route using<br>
electroporation to facilitate transfection of the muscle cells and of resident antigen<br>
presenting cells.<br>
A single Env protein booster (in MFS9 adjuvant) was given at 20 weeks by<br>
intramuscular injection at a separate site. Antibody titers were evaluated by ELIS A<br>
following each successive immunization. Serum specimens were collected at 0,4, 6, 8,<br>
12,22, and 24 weeks. Serum antibody titers were measured on ELISA. 96-well plates<br>
were coated with a protein in a concentration of lug/mL Serum samples were diluted<br>
serially 3-fold. Goat anti-rabbit peroxidase conjugate (1:20,000) was used for<br>
detection. TMB was used as the substrate, and the antibody titers were read at 0.6 OD<br>
at 450nm.<br>
Neutralizing antibody responses against PBMC-grown R5 HIV-1 strains were<br>
monitored in the sera collected from the immunized rabbits using two different assays<br>
in two different laboratories, the 5.25 reporter cell-line based assay at Chiron and the<br>
PBMC-based assay of David Montefiori at Duke University. Results are shown in<br>
Figures 94, 95, and 96. The Chiron assay was conducted essentially as follows.<br>
Neutralizing antibody responses against the PBMC-grown subtype C TV001 and<br>
TV002 strains were measured using an in-house reporter cell line assay that uses the<br>
5.25 cell line. This cell has CD4, CCR5, CXCR4 and BONZO receptor/co-receptors<br>
on its cell membrane. The parental GEM cell fine was derived from a 4-year-old<br>
Caucasian female with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, which was fused with the human<br>
B cell line 721.174, creating CEMxl74. LTR-GFP was transfected into the cells after<br>
the CCR5 gene (about 1.1 kb) was cloned into the BamH-I (5') and Sal-I (3') of the<br>
pBABE puro retroviral vector, and subsequently introduced into the CEMxl74. The<br>
green fluorescence protein (GFP) of the cells was detected by flow cytometer<br>
(FACScan). For the virus neutralization assay, 50 ul of titrated virus and 50 ul of<br>
diluted immune or pre-immune serum were incubated at room temperature for one<br>
hour. This mixture was added into wells with 104/Vml cells plated in a 24 well plate, and<br>
incubated at 37°C for 5 to 7 days. The cells were then fixed with 2% of formaldehyde<br>
after washing with PBS. Fifteen thousand events (cells) were collected for each sample<br>
on a Becton Dickinson FACScan using Cellquest software. The data presented were<br>
the mean of the triplicate wcDs. The percent neutralization was calculated compared to<br>
the virus control using the following equation: % virus Inhibition = (virus control-<br>
expetimental)/(virus control -cell control) x 100. Any virus inhibition observed in the<br>
pre-bieed has been subtracted for each individual animaL Values &gt;50% are considered<br>
positive and are highlighted in gray.<br>
In Figure 95, the "#" indicates that animals had high levels of virus inhibition in<br>
pre-bieed serum (&gt;20% virus inhibition) that impacted the magnitude of the observed<br>
inhibition and in some cases, our ability to score the serum as a positive or negative for<br>
the presence of significant neutralizing antibody activity (
For the data presented in Figure 96, serum samples were collected after a<br>
single protest boost (post-third) were screened in triplicate at a 1:8 dilution with virus<br>
(1:24 after addition of cells). Values shown are the % reduction in p24 synthesis<br>
relative to that in the corresponding pre-bleed control samples. Zero values indicate<br>
no or negative values were measured. NV, not valid due to virus inhibition in pre-<br>
immune serum. Neutralization was considered positive when p24 was reduced by at<br>
least 80%; these samples are highlighted in dark gray. Sample with lighter gray<br>
shading showed at least a 50% reduction in p24 synthesis.<br>
Figure 92 shows the ELISA data when plates were coated with the monomeric<br>
gpl20.TVl protein. This protein is homologous to the subtype C genes used for the<br>
immunization. All immunization groups produced high antibody titers after the second<br>
DNA immunization. The groups immunized with gpl40 forms of DNA have relatively<br>
higher geometric mean antibody titers as compared to the groups using gp160 forms<br>
after both first and second DNA immunizations. Both the gpl40.TVl and<br>
gpl40dVlV2.TVl genes produced high antibody titers at about 104 at two weeks post<br>
second DNA; the gpl40dV2.TVl plasmid yielded the highest titers of antibodies<br>
(&gt;104) at this time point and all others.. The binding antibody titers to the gpl20.TV1<br>
protein were higher for the group immunized with the homologous gpl40dV2.TV1<br>
genes than that with the beterologous gp140dV2.SP162 gene which showed titers of<br>
about 103. All the groups, showed some decline in antibody titers by 8 weeks post the<br>
second DNA immunization. Following the DNA plus protein booster at 20 weeks, all<br>
groups reached titers above that previously observed after the second DNA<br>
immunization (9.5 -1.0 log increases were observed). After the protein boost, all<br>
animals receiving the o-gp140dV2.TVl protein whether primed by the gp140dV2.TV1<br>
or gp160dV2.TVl DNA, showed the highest Ab titers.<br>
Binding antibody tiers were also measured using ELISA plates coated with<br>
either oligomeric subtype C o-gpl40dV2.TVl or subtype B o-gp140dV2.SF162<br>
proteins (Figure 93). For all the TV1 Env immunized groups, the antibody titers<br>
measured using the oligomeric protein, o-gp140dV2.TVl were higher man those<br>
measured using the monomeric (non-V2-deleted) protein, gp120.TVl. In fact, for<br>
these groups, the titers observed with the beterologous subtype B o-gp140dV2.SF162<br>
protein were comparable to or greater than those measured with the subtype C TV1<br>
gpl20. Nevertheless, all groups immunized with subtype C immunogens showed<br>
higher titers binding to the subtype C o-gp140dV2.TVl protein than to the subtype B<br>
protein gp140dV2.SF162. Conversely, the group immunized with the<br>
gpl40dV2.SF162 immunogen showed higher antibody titers with the oligomeric<br>
subtype B protein relative its subtype C counterpart. Overall, all three assays<br>
demonstrated mat high antibody cross-reactive antibodies were generated by the<br>
subtype CTV1-based DNA and protein immunogens.<br>
The results indicate that the subtype C TV 1-derived Env DNA and protein<br>
antigens are immunogenic inducing high titers of antibodies in immunized rabbits and<br>
substantial evidence of neutralizing antibodies against both subtype B and subtype C<br>
R5 virus strains. In particular, the gp140dV2.TVl antigens have induced consistent<br>
neutralizing responses against the subtype B SF162EnvDV2 and subtype C TV2<br>
strains. Thus, TV1-based Env DNA and protein-based antigens are immunogenic and<br>
induce high titer antibody responses reactive with both subtype C and subtype B HIV-<br>
1 Env antigens. Neutralizing antibody responses against the neutralization sensitive<br>
subtype B R5 HIV-1SF162DV2 strain were observed in some groups after only two DNA<br>
immunizations. Following a single booster immunization with Env protein, the<br>
majority of rabbits in groups that received V2-deleted forms of the TV1 Env showed<br>
neutralization activity against the closely related subtype C TV2 primary strain.<br>
Example 12<br>
Immunological Responses in Rhesus Macaques<br>
Cellular and humoral immune responses were evaluated in three groups of<br>
rhesus macaques (each group was made up of four animals) in an immunization study<br>
structured as shown in Table I. The route of administration for the immunizing<br>
composition was dectroporation in each case. Antibody titers are shown in Table I for<br>
two weeks post-second immunization.<br>
* pCMVgag = pCMVKm2.GagMod Type C Botswana<br>
pCMVenv = pCMVLink.gpl40env.dV2.TVl (Type C)<br>
pCMVpol = pCMVKm2.p2Pol.mut.Ina Type C Botswana<br>
pCMVgag-pol = pCMVKm2.gagCpol.mut.Ina Type C Botswana<br>
Pre-immune sera were obtained at week 0 before the first immunization. The<br>
first immunization was given at week 0. The second immunization was given at week<br>
4. The first bleed was performed at 2 weeks post-second immunization (i.e., at week<br>
6). A third immunization will be given at week 8 and a fourth at week 16. Animals<br>
2A, 3A, 3B and 3D had been vaccinated previously (approximately 4 years or more)<br>
with gag plasmid DNA or gag VLP (subtype B).<br>
Bulk CTL, 51Cr-release assays, and flow cell cytometry methods were used to<br>
obtain the data in Tables J and K. Reagents used for detecting gag- and pol-specific<br>
T-cells were (i) synthetic, overlapping peptides spanning "gagCpol" antigen (n=377),<br>
typically the peptides were pools of 15-mers with overlap by 11, the pools were as<br>
follows, pool 1, n=l-82, pool 2, n=83-164, pool 3, n=165-271, pool 4, n=272-377,<br>
accordingly pools 1 and 2 are "gag"-specific, and pools 3 and 4 are "pol"-specific, and<br>
(ii) recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV), for example, rWgag965, rWp2Po1975<br>
(contains p2p7gag975), and VVparent.<br>
Gag-specific IFNy + CD8 + T-cells, Gag-specific IFN? + CD4 + T-cells, Pol-<br>
specific IFNy + CD8 + T-cells, and Pol-specific IFN? + CD4 + T-cells in blood were<br>
determined for each animal described in Table I above, post second immunization.<br>
The results are presented in Tables J and K, It is possible that some of the pol-specific<br>
activity shown in Table K was directed against p2p7gag.<br>
These results support that the constructs of the present invention are capable of<br>
generating specific cellular and humoral responses against the selected HIV-<br>
polypeptide antigens.<br>
Although preferred embodiments of the subject invention have been described<br>
in some detail, it is understood that obvious variations can be made without departing<br>
from the spirit and the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.<br>
