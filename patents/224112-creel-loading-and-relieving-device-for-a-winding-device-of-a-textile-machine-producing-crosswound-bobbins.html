3.   PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be performed : -<br><br>
The invention relates to a creel loading and relieving device for a winding device of a textile machine producing cross-wound bobbins.<br>
Creel loading and relieving devices of this type substantially fulfil two objects during the production of a take-up bobbin. On the one hand, at the beginning of the bobbin travel, they should ensure minimum contact pressure of the tube or the still relatively light take-up bobbin on the associated drive roller, and on the other hand, during the bobbin travel, they should counteract the bobbin weight that is growing as the take-up bobbin becomes larger.<br>
As the contact pressure, in addition to the thread tension, determines the density of the take-up bobbin, generally a cross-wound bobbin, the aim is to keep the contact pressure as constant as possible during the entire bobbin travel.<br>
A creel loading and relieving device is known from DE 25 18 646 C2, in which a creel mounting the cross-wound bobbin is arranged above a drive roller in such a way that the weight of the creel and the weight of the cross-wound bobbin act in the direction of the drive roller. The contact pressure of the cross-wound bobbin on the drive roller is additionally amplified at the beginning of the bobbin travel by a combined loading and relieving element, preferably by a compression spring which engages on a lever lug of the creel and is supported on an adjustment bracket.<br>
In other words at the beginning of the bobbin travel, the action line of the compression spring is located behind the creel shaft in such a way that an additional torque in the sense of "increasing the contact pressure" firstly becomes effective on the creel. As the diameter of the cross-wound bobbin becomes larger, the creel pivots into a position, in which the action line of the compression spring points precisely through the pivot axis of the creel. In this position, the spring force of the loading and relieving element is neutralised. As the diameter grows, the action line of the<br><br>
compression spring then migrates in front of the pivot axis of the creel, in other words, the creel is now acted upon with a torque in the sense of "relieving the creel"<br>
The described creel loading and relieving device has been successful, in a slightly modified embodiment, in practice and a large number have been used for a long time.<br>
The drawback in this device is, however, that the contact pressure of the individual winding heads is adjusted centrally via a continuous adjustment rail, which constantly slightly elongates or shortens on temperature fluctuations. It is thus hardly possible to adjust uniform contact pressures at the individual winding heads of the textile machine with a continuous adjustment rail of this type, which pivots an adjustment bracket for the compression springs arranged there in the region of the winding heads.<br>
Furthermore, creel loading and relieving devices are known, for example from DE 39 11 854 C2, DE 41 21 775 Al or DE 41 11 617 Al, and operate in each case with a pneumatically loadable thrust piston gearing.<br>
DE 39 11 854 C2 describes a contact pressure control device, which has a take-up bobbin diameter detection device, a contact pressure correction determining device and a pneumatic drive device. In other words, in this known winding device, the instantaneous diameter of the cross-wound bobbin is initially determined by calculation from the rotational speed ratio of the drive roller and cross-wound bobbin and the known diameter of the drive roller. Taking into account a predetermined contact pressure correction curve, the contact pressure of the cross-wound bobbin on the drive roller is then adjusted by means of a pneumatic thrust piston gearing, which engages on an arm of the creel.<br>
Various, different embodiments for a control device for adjusting the contact pressure of a winding device are known from DE 41 21 775 Al. In all the<br><br>
embodiments, both a mechanical loading element and a pneumatic cylinder engage on the creel. One embodiment, in this case, describes, for example, a double-acting pneumatic cylinder, which is connected to two compressed air ductwork systems, which in each case have a different pressure level. By targeted loading of the pneumatic cylinder, in other words, depending on the piston side, which is loaded with pressure, and on the level of the pressure, which is provided on the piston, the creel can then be more or less loaded or relieved.<br>
DE 41 11 617 Al describes a device for controlling the contact pressure in a winding device, which has a length-adjustable lever arm fixed to the creel. The piston rod of a working cylinder is articulated to this lever arm via a joint, which is equipped with jockey rollers. The jockey rollers are provided, in each case in a replaceable control link, via the shape of which the contact pressure of the take-up bobbin can be adjusted on its drive roller.<br>
A creel loading and relieving device is also known from DE 195 34 333 Al, which has both a thrust piston gearing and a mechanical force introduction means engaging on the creel. The trust piston gearing, in this case, acts as a damper cylinder during the normal winding operation and can also be used if necessary as a drive to lift the cross-wound bobbin from the drive roller. The mechanical force introduction means acting on the creel consists of a first tooth segment which is connected so as to be rotationally engaged with the creel and meshes with a second tooth segment, which is in turn arranged on a lever element, which is mounted so as to be rotatable to a limited extent in the winding head housing. A tension spring, which is connected with prestressing to an adjustment lever, which can be fixed in various positions on the winding head housing, engages on this lever element. In other words, the direction of action of the tension spring and therefore the level of loading of the creel or the contact pressure, can be adjusted via the position of the adjusting lever, for example to produce soft, average or hard cross-wound bobbins.<br><br>
The above-described creel loading and relieving devices are either very complex and therefore expensive or were not completely convincing in practice with regard to their function.<br>
Proceeding from creel loading and relieving devices of the type described above, the invention is based on the object of improving devices of this type. In other words, providing a creel loading and relieving device, which is configured such that the contact pressure of each winding head can be adjusted easily and with precision in a simple manner and in that, in addition, a correction of the adjusted contact pressure is possible at any time, if necessary, without problems.<br>
Advantageous configurations of the invention are the subject of the sub-claims.<br>
The embodiment according to the invention of a creel loading and relieving device thus offers the advantage that the size and also the direction of action of an additional moment, which is applied to the creel by a force introduction means supported on the actuator, can be adjusted in a simple and very precise manner by a defined displacement of an actuator. In a preferred embodiment, the force introduction means is configured as a pneumatic spring. In other words, a pneumatic thrust piston gearing is articulated, for example, by its cylinder housing to an abutment of the actuator and by its piston rod to a lever arm which is connected so as to be rotationally engaged with the creel.<br>
With the embodiment according to the invention, it is not only possible to adjust the contact pressure according to the present material and the desired density of the take-up roller with precision and to keep it virtually constant during the entire bobbin travel, but it is also possible to work with a bobbin contact pressure which changes in the course of the bobbin travel. In this case, only the position of the<br><br>
actuator, to which the force introduction means is fastened, has to be adjusted. Preferably, the actuator in this case can be positioned without problems in any desired position by means of an electromotive drive within a predetermined adjustment range and therefore the additional loading or relieving moment, which is to act on the creel, in each case, can be adjusted sensitively and so that it can be reproduced. This means, that the bobbin contact pressure can be flexibly adapted to the respective existing winding conditions by the device according to the invention and hard, average or soft cross-wound bobbins can selectively be produced if necessary.<br>
As shown in claim 2, the electromotive drive is preferably connected to the actuator via a self-locking worm gear. A self-locking worm gear of this type has the advantage, for example, that no electrical energy is necessary during the winding operation to fix the position of the actuator. Worm gears of this type, known per se, are also very compact with regard to their structure, which is important in view of the confined space conditions, operate virtually free of play and are distinguished, in addition, by a long service life.<br>
In an advantageous configuration, the actuator, as shown in claim 3, is configured as a segment of a circle-like, preferably hollow component and, on its outer region, has worm gear teeth. Arranged inside the actuator is an abutment, on which the force introduction means is supported when loading the creel. The worm gear teeth in this case mesh with a drive worm of the worm gear which, as described in claim 5, is fixed so as to be rotationally engaged on the motor shaft of the electromotive drive. As worm gears of this type are generally self-locking and have a high transmission ratio of, for example 40:1, the drive can be relatively small and therefore economical to position the actuator despite the high moment, which is transferred to the creel via the force introduction means. In other words, a conventional commercial stepping motor with a relatively small size is sufficient to position the adjusting member precisely, which, as described in claim 4, is mounted so as to be rotatable to a limited extent about the pivot axis of the creel, and to fix it there.<br><br>
As described in claim 6, the thrust piston gearing acting as a pneumatic spring is connected to the machine's own compressed air ductwork system via a pneumatic line.<br>
The connection here, as shown is designed such that the pressure, with which the pneumatic spring is prestressed, is constantly at a predeterminable, constant pressure level. In other words, the pneumatic line connected to the piston cavity of the pneumatic thrust piston gearing has a check valve, which ensures that the pressure, with which the pneumatic spring is prestressed, is always at a predeterminable, constant pressure level. The pneumatic thrust piston gearing thus loads the creel, depending on the position of the adjusting member, with a moment, which can be easily adjusted via its direction of action both with regard to its size and also with regard to its basic action (loading or relieving) and can optionally be connected at any time.<br>
According to a so-called damper cylinder engages on a further lever arm of the creel. A damper cylinder of this type already very substantially suppresses in the initial stages, oscillations, which occur owing to the cross-wound bobbin revolving on the drive roller and this has a very advantageous effect overall on the running quietness of the winding device and therefore on the bobbin structure of the cross-wound bobbin.<br>
The damper cylinder may also be activated in a defined manner if necessary (claim 9). The entering piston rod of the damper cylinder then lifts the cross-wound bobbin from the drive roller.<br>
The invention will be described hereinafter in more detail with the aid of an embodiment shown in the drawings, in which:<br><br>
Fig. 1 schematically shows, in a side view, a workstation of a textile machine producing cross-wound bobbins with a spinning device and a winding device with a creel loading and relieving device,<br>
Fig. 2 shows the winding device according to Fig. 1 with a creel loading and relieving device according to the invention to an enlarged scale, also in a side view,<br>
Fig. 3 perspectively shows the creel with an associated creel loading and relieving device partially in section.<br>
One half of a textile machine producing cross-wound bobbins, in the embodiment, an open end rotor spinning machine, is shown in Fig. 1 and designated as a whole by the reference numeral 1. Open end rotor spinning machines of this type have, as is known, a large number of similar workstations 2, which are arranged next to one another in the longitudinal direction of the machine. The workstations 2 in this case have a spinning device 3 and a winding device 4. The fibre band 6 presented in spinning cans 5 is spun in the spinning devices 3 into threads 7, which are then wound on the winding devices 4 to form cross-wound bobbins 8.<br>
As indicated in Fig. 1 and described in more detail below with the aid of Figs. 2 and 3, the winding devices 4 are equipped, in each case, with a creel 9, which is acted upon by a loading and relieving device 30. An empty tube 10 or a cross-wound bobbin 8 is rotatably mounted in the creel 9 and driven in a frictionally engaged manner via a drive roller 11. Furthermore, workstations 2 of this type in each case have a thread draw-off device 19 and a thread traversing device 18.<br>
The open end spinning machine 1 also has a bobbin transporting device 12 arranged between the workstations 2 to dispose of finished cross-wound bobbins 8.<br>
A movable service unit 16 is arranged at or on the spinning machine 1, on a guide rail 13 and on a support rail 15. Service units 16 of this type patrol along the open<br><br>
end spinning machine 1 and engage automatically when a handling requirement occurs at one of the workstations 2. A handling requirement of this type exists, for example, when a full cross-wound bobbin 8 has to be exchanged for a new empty tube 10 at one of the workstations 2 and then has to be repieced. The service unit 16, for this purpose, as known, has numerous handling devices, which allow a proper cross-wound bobbin/empty tube change.<br>
Fig. 2 shows in a side view and, to a relatively large scale, the winding device 4 of a workstation 2 of a textile machine 1 producing cross-wound bobbins. The winding head housing of the workstation 2 has the reference numeral 21 here. Fixed so as to be rotatable to a limited extent on this winding head housing 21 is, as conventional, a creel 9, between the creel arms of which an empty tube 10 (see Fig. 3) or the tube of a cross-wound bobbin 8 is rotatably mounted in tube receiving plates 22. The tube 10 rests in this case on the drive roller 11 and is entrained thereby via frictional engagement.<br>
The creel 9, as can be seen in particular from Fig. 3, is pivotably mounted via a creel yoke 24, which has two bearing points and two lever arms 25 and 39 directed to the rear, on a creel shaft 23, which is in turn fixed in the winding head housing 21. As shown in Figs. 2 and 3, a damper cylinder 42 supported on the winding head housing 21 is articulated to the lever arm 39 via its piston rod 43 and minimises oscillations occurring during the winding operation in the region of the creel 9. The damper cylinder 42, which is connected to the pneumatic ductwork system (not shown) of the open end spinning machine 1 via a pneumatic line 44, can be activated if necessary such that the cross-wound bobbin 8 is lifted from the drive roller 11.<br>
As can be seen from Fig. 3, the lever arm 25 is acted upon by a force introduction means 29 of a creel loading and relieving device 30 characterised as a whole by the reference numeral 30. In other words, the lever arm 25 has, apart from a bearing point 26, which has the creel shaft 23 passing through it, a rear connection bore, in which a bolt 27 is fixed. The bolt 27 in this case forms a thrust bearing for the force<br><br>
introduction means which is configured as a pneumatic spring 29 and is also supported on an abutment 32 of the actuator 33, the actuator 33 being rotatably fastened in turn to the creel shaft 23 via a bearing point 34.<br>
The actuator 33, apart from the abutment 32 for the pneumatic spring 29 also has a tooth segment 35 with worm gear teeth.<br>
This tooth segment 35, with a worm 37, which is fixed on the motor shaft 41 of an electromotive drive, preferably a stepping motor 40, forms a worm gear 36, which, as is conventional in gearings of this type, has a relatively large ratio and is self-locking.<br>
As can be seen from Fig. 3, the pneumatic spring, which is formed by a pneumatic thrust piston gearing 29, is connected between the lever arm 25 of the creel 9 and the actuator 33 such that by corresponding activation of the stepping motor 40, the position of the actuator 33 and therefore also the direction of the force component, which acts by means of the pneumatic spring 29 on the creel 9, can be adjusted in a defined manner. In other words, by corresponding positioning of the actuator 33 by the electromotive drive 40, both the direction of rotation and the engagement angle, at which the force component of the pneumatic spring 29 engages on the lever arm 25, can be predetermined and therefore the contact pressure of the cross-wound bobbin on the drive roller 11 can be adjusted in a defined manner. This additional moment generated via the force component of the pneumatic spring 29 can be adjusted in this case either at the beginning of a bobbin travel and kept constant as far as possible during the bobbin travel or, if necessary, sensitively changed retrospectively if necessary in the course of the bobbin travel, in other words corrected.<br>
Functioning of the device:<br>
Figs. 2 and 3 show, for example, the starting position at the beginning of a bobbin travel. In the present embodiment, the actuator 33 is positioned such that the contact<br><br>
pressure is as low as possible, in other words, in the course of the bobbin travel, cross-wound bobbins 8 which are as soft as possible are wound. Owing to the stepping motor 40, the actuator 33 is positioned in a position in which the force component of the pneumatic spring 29 engages just above the creel shaft 23. This means the force component firstly acts upon the lever arm 25 in the clockwise direction resulting in a torque which initially slightly increases the contact pressure of the empty tube 10 on the drive roller 11. This torque, in addition to the weight of the creel 9, initially ensures that the empty tube 10 is pressed with an adequate contact force on the drive roller 11. The contact pressure of the empty tube 10 generated by the torque on the drive roller is selected in this case such that the empty tube 10 driven by the drive roller 11 via frictional engagement revolves very substantially free of slippage.<br>
As the cross-wound bobbin diameter grows, the creel 9 pivots in the direction of the arrow S (Fig. 2 or 3) about the creel shaft 23. The lever arm 25 and the pneumatic spring 29 connected to the lever arm 25 are thus also moved. In other words, the pneumatic spring 29 is pivoted downwardly about its abutment 32 on the actuator 33 as the fulcrum. The force component of the pneumatic spring 29 migrates in this case toward the creel shaft 23, with the decisive length of the lever arm 23 for the size of the effective torque becoming shorter. At the instant at which the force component of the pneumatic spring 29 runs through the creel shaft 23, the effective length of the lever arm 25 is zero. This means that at this instant no torque coming from the pneumatic spring 29 is effective. The cross-wound bobbin 8 which continues to grow during the course of the bobbin travel, pivots the creel 9 further in the direction S and therefore the lever arm 25 further downwardly. The force component of the pneumatic spring 29 thus also migrates further downward.<br>
This means that after passing through the above-described neutral position (force component passes through the creel shaft 23), the force component of the pneumatic spring 29 again brings about a torque on the lever arm 25, which is now effective but in the anti-clockwise direction, however. This torque that is effective in the anti-<br><br>
clockwise direction on the lever arm 25 now ensures that a moment which is effective counter to the bobbin and creel weight is present at the creel 9. As the effective length of the lever arm 25 constantly becomes greater as the bobbin diameter grows, the effective torque also increases in the course of the bobbin travel, so the increasing weight of the cross-wound bobbin 8 is automatically compensated.<br><br>
