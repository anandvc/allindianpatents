				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a locking device of the stator pack of pump diff users, in particular centrifugal submersible pumps.<br>
Such a device is suitable for locking the pack of the diffusers thus preventing any movement thereof, in particular in an axial direction, inside the cylindrical-casing of the pump.<br>
Locking devices are known comprising a pair of flanges provided on their external diameter with threading and each one of which is arranged at an end of the casing. Such threading engages in a corresponding threaded area obtained on the internal surface of the casing. The stator pack is locked by screwing the two threaded flanges and tightening the pack of diffusers between these flanges. Alternatively, a flange is provided that is welded to an end of the casing and another flange screwed to the casing using similar methods to those disclosed above.<br>
One drawback of the known devices is that it is not possible to exert the desired pressure on the pack of diffusers.<br>
In fact, with such devices it is rather difficult to rotate the flange by applying a desired tightening moment.<br>
Furthermore, in order to be able to effectively tighten the pack of diffusers, the flange must be screwed to the casing by using high tightening moments. In fact, the thread comes into contact with the threaded area on a significant portion of the respective threads, which generates resistant torques, which, owing to the friction, can reach considerably high values.<br>
Another drawback of such devices is that they are<br>
difficult to dismantle.<br>
This drawback is further accentuated by the presence<br>
of  encrusting matter  such  as  for  example  solid<br>
residue, oxides or slime, that are present in the<br>
fluid and infiltrate between the threading and the<br>
threaded area, thus acting as an adhesive.<br>
To unscrew the flange it is therefore .necessary 'to<br>
apply a high twisting torque thereto having a value<br>
that is hardly obtainable using common dismantling<br>
tools.<br>
Another drawback of the known devices is that they<br>
can be used only for pumps having a casing with a<br>
relatively high thickness.<br>
In fact, the threaded area obtained on the casing<br>
constitutes a zone of weakness of the casing and, if<br>
the casing has a limited thickness, the threaded area<br>
undergoes  plastic  deformation  during  operation,<br>
namely when the pump is crossed by fluid having high<br>
pressure.<br>
This deformation tends to axially extrude the flange<br>
from the casing,  making locking ineffective  and<br>
irreversibly damaging the casing, which has to be<br>
replaced.<br>
One object of the present invention is to improve the<br>
locking devices of the stator pack of pumps. •<br>
Another object is to obtain a locking device of the<br>
stator pack of pumps that can easily be fitted to and<br>
dismantled from a body of the pump.<br>
A further object is to obtain a•locking device of the<br>
pack of the pump diffusers .that is  sufficiently<br>
resistant not to be damaged when subjected to the<br>
pressure exerted by the pumped fluid, even when the<br>
device is applied to pumps operating at high pressure.<br>
A further object is to limit the depositing of encrusting matter on a locking device of the stator pack of pumps.<br>
According to a first aspect of the invention,  a locking device of the stator pacJc of a pump is provided, comprising casing means arranged to contain pumping stages of a fluid to be pumped, flange means suitable for closing said casing means, screw means provided with thread means and cooperating with nut screw means provided with further thread means for fixing together said flange means and said casing means, characterised in that said thread means has contour that is substantially non-complementary to a further contour of said further thread means. Owing to this aspect of the invention, it is possible to obtain a locking device of the stator pack of a pump in which between the thread means of the screw means and corresponding further thread means of nut screw means preset axial and diametral mechanical clearance are present.<br>
This enables flange means to be easily fitted to and dismantled from the casing means, inasmuch as the thread means and the further thread means are in contact along a surface of limited extent that does not generate great friction during screwing the flange means to and unscrewing the flange means from the casing means.<br>
Furthermore, the mechanical clearance enables, during a phase of dismantling of the device, axial shifting of the flange means in relation to the casing means, such as to remove any encrusting matter that may be<br>
present between the screw means and the nut screw means.<br>
In a second aspect of the invention a locking device of the stator pack of a pump is provided, comprising casing means suitable for containing the pumping stages of a fluid to be pumped, flange means suitable for closing said casing means, and connecting means arranged for fixing together said flange means and said casing means, characterised in that it further comprises seal means arranged to insulate said connecting means from said fluid.<br>
Owing to this aspect of the invention, it is possible to preserve the connecting means from contact with encrusting matter present in the fluid.<br>
If said connecting means comprises threaded coupling means it is possible to prevent encrusting matter to deposit between screw means and nut screw means that define the above mentioned threaded coupling means.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a locking device of the stator pack of a pump, comprising a casing for containing the pumping stages of a fluid to be pumped, a flange suitable for closing said casing, screw means cooperating with nut screw means for fixing together said flange and said casing, characterised in that said screw means has a contour that is, at least at a non-active thread side, non-complementary to a further contour of said nut screw means.<br>
The invention may be better understood and implemented with reference to the attached drawings, which illustrate an embodiment thereof by way of non-limiting example, in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a fragmentary section taken along a longitudinal plane of a<br>
locking device according to the invention;<br>
Figure 2 is an enlarged detail of Figure 1;<br>
Figure 3 is a detail like the one in Figure 2 in which flange means of the<br>
device are shifted axially in relation to casing means.<br>
Figure 1 shows a locking device 1 of the stator pack of a pump.<br>
The locking device 1 comprises a flange 2 of circular shape, in metal material, provided with threading on one of its external surfaces. The threading defines a<br><br><br>
screw element 3 arranged to engage in a corresponding<br>
nut  screw element 5 defined by a threaded area<br>
obtained inside a casing 4 arranged to contain the<br>
stator pack of the diffusers - not shown - of the<br>
pump.<br>
The casing 4 comprises a tubular element in steel, at<br>
an end 6 of which the nut- screw element  5  is<br>
obtained.<br>
At a further end of the casing 4, opposite the end 6,<br>
is directly welded a closing cover against which the<br>
flange 2 presses the pack of the diffusers.<br>
Alternatively, at the further end a further nut screw<br>
element can be provided arranged to engage with a<br>
further screw element of a further flange similar to<br>
the flange 2 disclosed above.<br>
In this case, the stator pack is tightened against<br>
the flange 2 and the further flange.<br>
The screw element 3 has a contour that is different<br>
from a further contour of the nut screw element 5.<br>
More in detail, in Figures 2 and 3, the screw element<br>
3 comprises a thread 8 that has an axial height C.<br>
Similarly,  the nut screw  element  5  comprises  a<br>
further thread 14 that defines a helicoidal groove 7<br>
that has a further axial height S.<br>
The nut screw element 5 can be obtained through<br>
plastic deformation of the end 6 of the casing 4.<br>
In this case, the further thread 14 is obtained in a<br>
portion  of  metal  material  having  a  constant<br>
thickness. .<br>
The further axial height S of the further thread 14,<br>
and consequently of the groove 7, is greater than the<br>
axial height C of the thread 8 that is received<br>
inside it.<br>
In this way, between the groove 7 and the thread 8 -when they are coupled - there is defined a mechanical clearance Gl of a preset amount.<br>
The thread 8 comprises an active side 15 and a non-active side 16.<br>
The active side 15 is configured in such a way as to be more tilted, at least at a crest 27 of the thread 8, than the non-active side 16, in relation to .a longitudinal axis Z of the device 1.<br>
The further thread 14 comprises a further active side 18 and a further non-active side 19.<br>
The further active side 18 is configured in such a way as to be more tilted, at least at a further crest 28 of the further thread 14 that the further non-active side 19, in relation to the Z axis. In particular, the active side 15 and the further active side 18 are arranged substantially perpendicularly to the axis (Z) .<br>
The contour of the thread 8 and the further contour of  the  further  thread  14  are  substantially complementary in correspondence of the active side 15 and of the further active side 18 and substantially non-complementary in correspondence of the non-active side 16 and of the further non-active side 19. The screw element 3 and the nut screw element 5 are movable between an active configuration, indicated by X in Figure  2,  in which the  operative  side  15 interacts with the further active side 18, and a non-operative configuration, indicated by Y in Figure 3, in which the active side 15 is distant from the further active side 18.<br>
In the non-operative configuration Y, between the active side 15 and the further active side 18 there is defined a gap 29 having a width A and such<br>
dimensions as to allow the passage of particles of solid matter dispersed in the fluid between the screw element 3 and the nut screw element 5.<br>
In the operative configuration X, the active side 15 interacts with the further active side 18 along a contact zone 17 of limited surface extent.<br>
. The thread 8 and the further thread 14 are such that the- reaction that occurs in the contact zone 17 has a line of action directed substantially parallel to the Z axis.<br>
In other words, the screw element 3 and the nut screw element 5 are subjected during use to a substantially axial load.<br>
It is thus significantly increased the resistance of the coupling to the axial loads due to pressurised fluid.<br>
In  addition,  the  limited surface  extent  of  the contact zone 17 enables the phase of fitting the locking device 1 to be facilitated inasmuch as the contact reaction has a limited friction component. Consequently, the torque value required for screwing<br>
the flange 2 is rather limited.<br>
Furthermore, the external diameter of the nut screw<br>
element 5 is greater than the external diameter of<br>
the screw element 3.<br>
Consequently,   also   diametrically   there  exists<br>
mechanical clearance G of a preset quantity between<br>
the thread 8 and the groove 7.<br>
The thread 8 has a depth h greater than the depth of<br>
the further thread 14 and, therefore, than the depth<br>
H of the groove 7.<br>
The pump is assembled in the manner disclosed below.<br>
The diffusers, which form the stator pack, and the<br>
impellers, are arranged in the correct sequence to<br><br>
form a preassembled pack, which is inserted inside<br>
the casing 4 till making it to rest against said<br>
closing cover arranged at the further end of the<br>
casing 4.<br>
Subsequently, tightening is achieved by screwing the<br>
flange 2 to the casing 4.<br>
The flange 2 presses the stator pack as the screw<br>
element 3 is screwed onto the corresponding nut screw<br>
element 5, until a preset preload value is reached.<br>
Alternatively,  fitting  of  the  flange  2  can  be<br>
achieved by using a pusher tool that is not shown,<br>
comprising  an  anchoring  element  that  engages  in<br>
projections 22 of the nut screw element 5 and a push<br>
rod arranged in contact with internal zones of the<br>
stator pack.<br>
The  projections  22  are  obtained in  an external<br>
surface 23 of the casing 4, at the groove 7 defined<br>
by the further thread 14 in the nut screw element 5.<br>
This pusher tool is pressed on the stator pack in<br>
such a way as to compress it and facilitate screwing<br>
of  the  flange  2,  which  occurs  without  further<br>
pressure on the pack of the diffusers.<br>
With reference to Figure 3, during dismantling of the<br>
locking device 1, the flange 2 can be subjected to<br>
axial shifts towards the inside of the casing 4, in a<br>
direction indicated by the arrow F.<br>
Such axial shifts are obtained by mechanical impacts<br>
given in an axial direction to a top of the flange 2<br>
and are made possible by the fact that between the<br>
thread  8  and the groove  7  there  is  the  axial<br>
mechanical clearance Gl.<br>
The axial shifts enable any encrustation of matter to<br>
be broken up that has formed through depositing of<br>
residues  or slime present in the fluid that has<br>
infiltrated   between   the   screw   element   3   and   the   nut<br>
screw element  5,   causing sticking  of the coupling.<br>
In   the   non-operative  configuration  Y,   portions   of  the<br>
encrustation  may  be  removed   from   the   contact   zone   17<br>
through   the   gap   29   defined  between   the   screw   element<br>
3  and the  nut  screw element  5.<br>
Subsequently,    the    flange   2    can    easily   be   unscrewed<br>
without  having to  apply High torsional moments.<br>
The   locking  device   1  enables   the   dismantling phase  to<br>
be    significantly    facilitated,     considerably    limiting<br>
seizure    or    sticking   of   the    coupling,    even    in    the<br>
presence  of polluted fluids.<br>
The   locking  device   1  furthermore   comprises   seal  means<br>
24   arranged   to   insulate   the   screw   element   3   and  the<br>
nut  screw  element  5 from the  fluid.<br>
The   seal   means   24   comprises   a   first   gasket   9   and   a<br>
second    gasket    10,    arranged    respectively    above    and<br>
below the  threaded coupling.<br>
The     first     gasket     9    is    received    in    a     cavity    12<br>
obtained  on  the   flange  2  upstream  of  the  thread  8   and<br>
the    second   washer    10  'is    received    in    a    housing    13<br>
obtained  on the  flange 2 downstream of the thread  8.<br>
The   first   gasket   9   and  the   second   gasket   10   are   such<br>
as    to    cooperate   with   internal    surfaces   lla,    lib   of<br>
the    casing    4    to    ensure    a    seal    against    fluid    and<br><br>
substantially insulate the coupling zone between the<br>
flange 2 and the casing 4 from encrusting material, such as for examples residues or slime conveyed by the fluid.<br>
The first gasket 9 comprises an appendage 25 arranged to partially envelop an edge zone 26 of the casing 4. The second gasket 10 is placed in direct contact with the pumped fluid.<br>
The pumped fluid thus presses the second gasket 10 against the flange 2 and the casing 4, such as toB ensure its seal.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
