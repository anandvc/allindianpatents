				<td>INTRODUCTION TO THE FIELD OF INVENTION.<br>
This invention relates to improved angled guide plate for use in elastic fastening system for railway track.<br>
This invention more particularly relates to improved angled guide plate, which ensures zero restraint on rail foot by the fastening system.<br>
This invention in another aspect relates to improved rail fastening system using an improved angled guide plate.<br>
PRIOR ART AND THE DRAWBACK<br>
It is already known to use angled guide plates in rail fastening system, which are known as elastic fastening system. The angled guide plate used in the known art assembly enable the fastener clip to exert restraint on rail and permit longitudinal movement of rails. The main drawback of this system is that by use of these angled guide plates the movement of the rails is restrained during temperature variations. It is essential that the rail is not restrained against longitudinal movement (due to temperature variations) when laid on girder bridges as well as in ballastless tracks.<br>
Several Patents have been granted for rail fastening system using the above described angled plate. See for instance Indian Patent 167700 and 174835.<br>
The applicant is also aware of certain prior art patents as follows.<br>
(a) US Patent No.5069386    (b) British Patent No.714013    (c) British Patent No.764404.<br>
The applicant has studied all these prior art patents, none of which is relevant to the applicant's construction for the following reasons.<br>
1. <br>
(a)	The invention as per specification of US 5069386 dt.03.12.1991 relates to a<br>
fastening clip   for holding rail to the sleeper by anchoring into the   shoulder<br>
embedded in a concrete sleeper or base. The Toe of the clip, by resting on rail<br>
foot exerts pressure on rail flange. On account of this pressure, the longitudinal<br>
movement of rail due to temperature changes is restrained.<br>
(b)	In the applicant's invention it is aimed at keeping the rail free from the restraint on<br>
rail by preventing load/pressure imposed by the fastener clip.<br>
2<br><br>
(c)	Therefore, the U.S patent has no relevance to the applicant's invention.<br>
(d)	More over, the clip of The U.S patent is made from a resilient metal rod round in<br>
section which has a first end and a second end   and progressing from first end, a portion or<br>
section forming substantially a linear arm, a second section forming 180 degree bend, a third<br>
portion, a fourth section forming substantially 180 degree bend disposed on the same side as the<br>
second section with respect to the third section, and a fifth section disposed substantially parallel<br>
to the rail and adapted to exert load on rail flange and an anchoring device adapted to receive the<br>
clip and embedded in the concrete sleeper; a sixth section disposed transversely with reference<br>
to the fifth section.<br>
(e)	Whereas in the improved invention of the applicant, the guide plate is made from rolled<br>
section or by a casting from steel or SG iron and is non-elastic.<br>
(f)	The two constructions, one of the clip and second of guide plate are entirely apart. The<br>
clip 506938 has elastic property and dampens rail vibration while the said guide plate is<br>
rigid and non-elastic.<br>
(g)	The function of elastic clip is to exert load on rail while that of guide plate is to enable<br>
relive the rail from load of similar clip/clips.<br>
(h) The said clip requires an anchoring means, while the said guide plate does not requiring anchoring device.<br>
With respect to the above analysis it can be said that the above prior art patent has no relevance to the applicant's invention.<br>
2. <br>
(a)	The very title of the above British patent is suggestive of the fact that it is primarily aimed at<br>
relating to fastening meant to arrest rail creep and adjustment of track gauge. Creep is a<br>
phenomenon of rail movement and is the effect of moving load and takes place generally in<br>
the direction of traffic.<br>
(b)	For arresting creep, there is essentially requirement of holding of rail as firmly as possible<br>
with the sleeper forming rail base. The fastening system as per the British patent exerts<br>
restraint on rail and is therefore different than zero restraint on rail fastening system as per<br>
applicant's invention and has therefore no relevance at all.<br>
3<br><br>
(c) Further from the point of view of constructional features, the British patent comprises of a spring bar or strip having one end formed as a spring loop to serve as rail clip by bearing on the rail flange and its other end is formed as or carrying a cam or eccentric part this end being pivoted by a pin to the sleeper or bearing plate The fastening is turned on the pivot with the clip exerting resilient pressure on rail foot, and the cam shaped end simultaneously providing rigid shoulder to the edge of rail foot<br>
(d) There is no such constructional feature in the applicants invention nor there is any turning involved during usage<br>
(e) Therefore, the above British patent has no relevance to applicant's invention 3 <br>
(a)	The above British patent relates to fastening device "Resilient Rail spike with Resilient Clip'<br>
comprising<br>
(i)	a spike with two legs<br>
(ii)         a bridge piece (iii)        two helical windings . and<br>
(iv)        a clip which is T-shaped and has cross members supported within the helical coils and has a member meant to rest under the bridge piece<br>
(b)	The rail spike acts as anchoring device for the clip, which holds the rail foot<br>
(c)	The system is used by spiking the legs into pre-made holes in the sleepers, the functioning of<br>
system depending upon the quality of grips between the legs of spike and holes in sleepers The<br>
the acting as a unit within the spike<br>
(d)	Obviously the constructional details of the resilient Rail spike with resilient clip and the<br>
purpo  of its usage ate enterly different<br>
(e)	There are the above British patent has no relevance with the applicant s invention<br>
4<br><br>
4 <br>
(i) The above prior art US patent has also been brought to our knowledge and on consideration we submit that it is totally an irrelevant prior an     The reasons are as<br>
follows<br>
(ii) According to specification US Patent 5042717 the object of the invention described in the said US Patent is a "Strap" for the quick fastening of a railroad rail to ties or strengers made of concrete, wood, plastic or metal strap composed of a steel or reinforced plastic rod having a vertical rectilinear part terminating in an eccentric heel intended for interacting with a catching means is associated with the the or with a metal sole plate fastened to the tie and a curved part which forms a spring and the end of which is intended to press onto the flange of the rail after the rotation of the rod about its vertical part. During rotation the said end moves on ramp intended for tensioning that part of the strap forming a spring and for fading it onto the flange of the rail<br>
(iii) The function of 'Strap' or Fastening Clip can be visualized clearly by referring to Figs. Of the US Patent in which it is very clear that the portions of Strap in all the seven figures imparts pressure/ load on top of foot of the rail thus preventing longitudinal movement of the Rail   Copies of seven said figures are enclosed for ready reference.<br>
iv) The cited US Patent is in complete variation with claims made in our Complete Specification of 'An improved Angled Guide Plate for use in Elastic Fastening system for Railway track' in that our said invention is to allow longitudinal movement of Rails/ Long Welded Raits due to vanations in temperatures to prevent the resulting transfer oi stresses form Rail / LWR to Bridge Girders/ Ballastiess Slab Track<br>
v)   Therefore citation of US Patent No. 5042717 is irrelevant and our invention does not in<br>
any manner infringe the cited US Patent Objects of the Invention:<br>
it is. therefore, an object of this invention to propose an improved angled guide plate for use in railway track fastening system, which will enable the fastening clip to allow longitudinal movement of the rail during variations in temperature<br>
5<br><br>
It is another object of this invention to propose an improved rail fastening system having an improved angled guide plate due to which the free longitudinal movement of the rails is not hindered during temperature variations.<br>

Figure 2 shows schematically the configuration of a known angled guide plate<br>
Figure 3 shows a top view of Figure 2<br>
Figure 4 shows schematically the configuration of the improved angled guide plate of the invention<br>
Figure 5 shows the top view of Figure A and<br>
Figure 6 shows the improved angled guide plate 2A in an elastic fastening system<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING:<br>
As can be seen from Figs. 1. 2 and 3. the known guide plate is characteristic of the following constitutional features<br>
The known angled guide plate has a bottom surtace 'B' principally with three sections S1. S2 and S3 as shown in figure 2<br>
Section S 3 has a straight bottom surface followed by section S2. which has a curved surface which is followed by section S1 which has an upward inclined bottom surface<br>
The top surface T principally has at least differently formed regions R1. R2. R3 HA and R5 forming the upper surface<br>
Region R1 is again provided with sub regions namely a vertical surface region R1 a, an indite*! end surface region R1 b, horizontal mid surface region R1 c. which is parallel to the bottom surface S3 and an end surface region R1d which is vertical surface and can also be partially indined and partially vertical.<br>
These sub regions R1a, R1b, R1c are contiguous to one another<br>
The region R2 is also contiguous to R1 and has horizontal surface R2 a parallel to the bottom surface, a trapezoidal rib R 2b with its top surface parallel to bottom surface S3 and another sub region R2c which is also a horizontal surface parallel to the bottom surface and may or may. not lie in the same plane in which the sub region R2a lies.<br>
The region R3 is a curved (inverted dome shaped) surface formed directly above bottom curved section S2.<br>
7<br><br>
The top horizontal surface of the rib R2b and the lower most point of the inverted dome curved surface of region R3 are of specific requirements to meet the standards.<br>
The region R4 of the top surface is inclined upward and is nearly simply a straight surface parallel to the bottom surface S1.<br>
The region R5 is an inclined or horizontal surface connecting the bottom surface S1 and surface R4 of the top.<br>
These regions R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 on the top surface together cover the corresponding length of the bottom surface S3, S2 and S1<br>
The section, S2 surface, is provided with a nearly U-cure measuring a contained angle of about 60° and the relative height difference between surfaces S2 and S3 depending upon the standard set for resting of angled guide plate against the surface in the concrete bed/sleeper.<br>
In another Known Art of the design of the angled guide plate (for use where change in rail section is required), the region R1 of the above described angled guide plate is of configuration as shown in Figure 2A.<br>
In this Figure 2A, the sub region R1e protrudes out from vertical surface R 1a of the above described angled guide plate The top surface of the sub region R1e and its bottom surface S4 are horizontal and parallel to bottom surface S3.<br>
The bottom surface S4 of the region R1e is placed at higher level "D" than the surface S3 of the above described angled guide plate and depends upon the thickness of pad plate beneath the rail. Its width "W* depends upon the rail section to be used. Its vertical surface Rif is parallel to the vertical face R1a of Figure 2.<br>
Figure 1 shows the elastic fastening assembly only on half of rail seat on concrete sleeper. Similar assembly applies on the other half of rail on the same rail seat. The essential parts of the assembly are:<br>
Fastening clip	1<br>
Angled guide plate   2<br>
8<br><br>
Insulating plate	3<br>
Plastic dowel (embedded in concrete)	A<br>
Sleeper screw	5<br>
Pad plate	6<br>
The function of the angled guide plate is not described in detail as it is well known.  But it is relevant<br>
to make a point that the angled guide plate of Figures 2 &amp; 3 is set out in the fastening assembly that<br>
the vertical face R1a extending parallel to and by the side of rail flanye edge.   Similarly, the vertical<br>
surface R1f of the Figure 2A extending parallel to and by the side of edge of rail flange<br>
INVENTED ANGLED GUIDE DETAILS.<br>
Figure 4 and Figure 5 show the improved angled guide plate of the invention   It has principally all the<br>
configuration of the known angled guide plate.    However, the thickness and angles may vary<br>
according to the rail section required to be used.<br>
The important improvement is the provision of an additional reyion R6 with the bottom surface S8. contiguous to the first region R1 and towards vertical surface region R1a in the angled guide plate. This region R6 is preferably a uniform rectangular region though the configuration may vary as per necessities.<br>
The region R6 is contiguous with the first region R1 and its bottom section S6 is set out at suitable height with respect to the bottom surface section S3 depending on rail section to be used and at an upward inclination same as that of flange of rail to be used.<br>
The region R6 has a top surface R7 in the region of the surface R1a of the known construction and has nearly a vertical surface R8 at the end.<br>
It will be understood that in the assembly with angled guide plate of known art, the rails are held such that the longitudinal movement of rails is restrained during temperature variations.<br>
9<br><br>
the improved device, the known Angled Guide plate is modified as that the fastening system shown in Figure 6 with its other constituents to function such that there is no restraint on the rail and it is free to expand/contract and move longitudinally due to temperature variations. This free movement of Rail is essential, in case where long welded rails are continued on Girder bridges, and in Ballastless Track.<br>
The improvised Angled Guide Plate is henceforth called the RH type angled guide plate.<br>
In Figure 4 and Figure 5, the portion R6 with top surface R7, and to be referred to as Lip of Angled Guide Plate, is the toe receiving portion of the innovation for the known fastener and it overrides the rail foot in the assembly of Figure 6 with gap between the bottom surface S6 and top of rail flange while the rail shall be running parallel to and by the side of vertical surface R1a as in conventional fastening Figure 1. The angle 'a' of the lip of the angled guide plate depends upon the rail section use d in the assembly. Other portions of Figure 4 and Figure 5 are suitably designed and dimensioned depending upon the rail section (to be used) so that the known fastener dip 1 of Figure 1 exerts its designated toe load on the lip of the RH type angled guide plate and the rail is free from the pressure of toe of the known fastener and the lop is suitably designed for strength so that it does not buckle under the toe load of the fastening during service.<br>
With the RH type angled guide plate in the assembly there is a gap between the bottom surface of lip of the angled guide plate and the top surface of the rail flange, to the extent of 1 to 2 mm or as required, as seen in Figure 6.<br>
The RH type guide plate may be a rolled steel section or cast steel or cast SG iron.<br>
