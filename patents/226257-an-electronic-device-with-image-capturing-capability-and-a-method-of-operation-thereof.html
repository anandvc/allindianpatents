FIG. 3 is a flowchart illustrating one embodiment of the operation of the electronic device of FIGs. 1 and 2. Specifically, the operation illustrates one embodiment of the operation of the image manager 255 in accordance with the present invention. As illustrated in FIG. 3, the operation begins with Step 300 in which an image is captured by the device. For example, the image capture means 245 of the communication device 200 can capture an image in response to a user input to the user interface 235. Next, in Step 305, the operation determines the orientation of the captured image. For example, the tilt sensor 240 can determine the tilt of the communication device 200. Alternatively, the image manager 255 can include image recognition software to determine the orientation of the captured image. Next, in Step<br>
310, the operation determines whether or not the orientation is acceptable as captured. For example, the image manager 255 can query a device user using the display 230 or the alert 225 requesting acceptance of the captured orientation. A user input to the user interface 235 can indicate acceptance or rejection of the current orientation. In one embodiment, (not shown) the image is displayed on the display 230 with the captured orientation to assist the user in determining if the orientation is acceptable. Alternatively, the image manager 255 can be adapted to automatically determine whether the orientation is acceptable using a pre-programmed .set of parameters or instructions.<br>
When the orientation is not acceptable in Step 310, the operation continues to Step 31 5 in which the image manager 255 determines whether or not to change the orientation, for example, by rotating the captured image. For example, the image manager 255 can query a device user using the display 230 or the alert 225 requesting a determination of whether or not to rotate the captured image. A user input to the user interface 235 can indicate a desire to rotate the captured image. In one embodiment, (not shown) the image is displayed on the display 230 with the captured orientation to assist the user in determining whether or not to rotate the captured image. Alternatively, the image manager 255 can be adapted to automatically determine whether or not to change the orientation of the captured image using a preprogrammed set of parameters or instructions.  When a rotation is desired/required in Step 315, the operation continues to Step 320 in which the amount of the rotation is determined. As in previous steps, the amount of rotation can be determined by a user input to the user interface 235 or alternatively using a predetermined set of instructions or calculations.<br><br><br>
Next, and/or when the orientation is acceptable in Step 310, and/or when no rotation is required/desired in Step 315, the operation continues to Step 325 in which the image manager 255 determines whether or not to store ihe captured image in the memory 220. For example, the device user may desire to store the captured image with the appropriate orientation in the memory 220 for later retrieval and/or utilization. When it is required/desired to store the image in Step 325, the operation continues to Step 330 and the image is stored along with the associated orientation. Next, and when the image is not required/desired to be stored in Step 325, the operation continues to Step 335 in which the captured image along with the appropriate orientation is displayed on the display 230.<br>
The device and method of operation as recited herein allows a device user to capture pictures at any angle and display on a communication device display. The user doesn't need to hold the image capture means or the communication device in any specific orientation to gel a perfect picture.<br>
