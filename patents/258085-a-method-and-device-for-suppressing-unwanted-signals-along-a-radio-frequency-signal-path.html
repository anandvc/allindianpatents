FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to methods and devices that suppress interference in RF<br>
circuitry, and more particularly, to circuits and layout techniques for distributing an<br>
oscillator reference signal while suppressing unwanted spurious signals.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
Integrated radio receivers cannot easily implement radio-frequency (RF) synthesizers<br>
that are robust to interference while having a fast settling time. Interference<br>
robustness requires that all frequencies be synchronized. This typically requires that<br>
the frequency synthesizer reference frequency be equal to the RF channel spacing and<br>
that the reference oscillator frequency, generally generated by a crystal oscillator, be<br>
an integer multiple of the channel spacing. Such an arrangement would be virtually<br>
spurious free, since all frequencies are hannonically related. However, the settling<br>
time of a synthesizer having this reference frequency and channel spacing relationship<br>
would be undesirably long because settling time is proportional to the reciprocal of<br>
the channel spacing (i.e., the reference frequency).<br>
Because of these conflicting requirements, which are further aggravated by the<br>
necessity support frequency generation for various standards with unrelated channel<br>
spacings, fractional-N synthesizers are commonly used. Fractional-N synthesizers,<br>
however, are prone to generating spurious components when the generated radio<br>
carrier frequency is close, but, not equal to, an integer multiple of the synthesizer<br>
reference frequency. Consequently, spurs at offsets equal to the difference between<br>
the carrier and the reference harmonic will accompany the carrier. See, Jan-Wim<br>
Eikenbroek and Sven Mattisson, " Frequency Synthesis for Integrated Transceivers,"<br>
chapter Part IE, pages 339-355, in High-Speed Analog-to-Digital Converters: Mixed-<br>
Signal Design; PLLs and Synthesizers, Kluwer Academic, Publishers, 2000.<br>
Suppressing these spurious components is very difficult and time consuming, often<br>
requiring many applications specific integrated circuit (ASIC) iterations that increase<br>
the complexity and cost associated with these devices.<br><br>
Fractional-N synthesizers typically take the reference frequency from either an on-<br>
chip or an off-chip crystal oscillator (XO), which is supplied to the phase frequency<br>
detector via one or more buffers. These buffers are needed to guarantee sufficiently<br>
low noise levels by boosting the crystal signal power and by making the reference<br>
zero crossings as short as possible (e.g., a sharp square wave). Modem radio<br>
transceivers (i.e., transmitter plus receiver) often are formed as integrated circuits<br>
(e.g., as an ASIC) including one or more RF oscillator(s) on-chip. RF oscillators,<br>
however, are sources of undesirable signal and supply leakage that introduce<br>
performance-degrading interference, not only into their associated circuits, but also<br>
into nearby circuits. One source of interference from an on-chip RF oscillator is the<br>
inductor of the oscillator's LC tank circuit, which is tuned to a particular frequency<br>
based on an applied control voltage (e.g., by controlling a voltage of varactor that<br>
changes the capacitance of the LC tank).<br>
Figure 1 depicts interference scenarios that, can occur with respect to a conventional<br>
fractional-N phase locked loop (PLL) frequency synthesizer. As shown in Figure 1, a<br>
crystal oscillator (XO) 110 generates a reference signal 112, which is fed into a buffer<br>
114. The reference signal is preferably a sinusoidal signal having a frequency denoted<br>
byfxo (or more generally, fref, to indicate the.frequency of any type of reference<br>
frequency signal). The buffer 114 may be a limiter that produces a version of the XO<br>
reference frequency signal <f> R 116 at the frequency fref and having a steep zero-<br>
crossing characteristic. The reference signal output from the XO-buffer is fed to a<br>
phase frequency detector (PFD) 118 together with the phase and frequency of the<br>
output of the frequency divider 132. The output of the PFD is a pulse that is related to<br>
the phase and frequency difference between the reference frequency signal <f> R 116<br>
and the output of the frequency divider 132. The output from the phase detector 118 is<br>
applied to a charge pump (not shown) and then filtered by a loop filter 122. The.<br>
output of the loop filter 122 is then applied to a voltage-controlled oscillator<br><br>
(VCO) 126. The output signal <f>0 128 of the VCO 126 is supplied to the input of the<br>
frequency divider 132. The frequency divider receives a control signal supplied to the<br>
control input 134.<br>
As a result of this feedback arrangement, the frequency,^,, of the VCO 126 output<br>
signal ^0 is driven to equal the frequency of the reference signal times the division<br>
factor of the frequency divider 132. Hence, the frequency of the VCO 126 can be<br>
controlled by controlling the division factor via the control input 134 of the frequency<br>
divider 132.<br>
The frequency divider 132 dynamically divides the frequency f0 of the VCO output<br>
signal ^ o by N and N plus or minus some integer (i.e., N ± M, where N and M are<br>
integers) in a proportion that results in an average division ratio N plus the fraction,<br>
K/F (K. and F integers). K/F is the duty cycle that determines the fractional value,<br>
where F is the fractional modulus of the circuit (e.g., 8 would indicate a 1/8*<br>
fractional resolution) and K is the fractional channel of operation. By applying K and<br>
F values pertaining to a particular desired frequency to the frequency divider control<br>
input 134, the frequency of the signal <j>§ at the VCO 126 output can be set to a<br>
frequency of^-^e/N + K/F).<br>
As shown by the dashed paths in Figure 1, inductive coupling from the VCO inductor<br>
will find its way into the crystal oscillator bonding wires (not shown), the reference-<br>
frequency signal path 112 along path 140, the PFD input paths 116 and 136 along<br>
paths 142 and 144, respectively, and the supply rails (not shown) along path 146. The<br>
supplies may also be disturbed by VCO currents, which cause voltage drops between<br>
Vcc, ground, and substrate. When the VCO frequency leaks into either PFD input,<br>
undesirable low-frequency mixing products may result.<br>
The PFD inputs of a frequency synthesizer are typically connected to latches. For<br>
instance, edge-triggered latches are widely used in the PFD of fractional-N<br>
synthesizers. The basic form of this type of PFD includes a pair of edge-triggered,<br>
resettable D-fiip flops having their D inputs set to logical ONE. The clock inputs of<br>
the D-flip flop respectively receive a signal having a frequency of the voltage<br><br>
• controlled oscillator (VCO) divided by some number set in a frequency divider. The<br>
Q outputs of the D-flip flops are input to an AND gate, which when high, outputs a<br>
reset signal to both D-flip flops. The states of the Q outputs from the D-flip flops<br>
produce respective "UP" and "DOWN" pulses with a duration corresponding to<br>
whether the frequency of the reference frequency leads or lags the frequency of the<br>
frequency divided VCO signal. The PFD output is used in a known manner to control<br>
a charge pump, which outputs a signal that is low pass filtered and applied to the<br>
VCO input. A more detailed description of edge-triggered PFDs can be found in T. H.<br>
Lee, "The Design of CMOS Radio-Frequency Integrated Circuits," Cambridge<br>
University Press, Cambridge, 1998, andB. Razavi, "RF Microelectronics," Prentice-<br>
Hall, Upper Saddle River, 1998.<br>
The latches of an^edge-triggered PFD are wideband. When the VCO signal leaks into<br>
any of the latch clocks, timing jitter appears in the VCO control voltage generated by<br>
the PFD. Jitter on the VCO control voltage will cause mixing of the VCO with the<br>
closest harmonic of the reference. When the difference between the two is sufficiently<br>
small, two undesirable in-band spurious tones will appear on either side of the VCO<br>
output frequency.<br>
Without loss of generality, the interference scenario shown in Figure 1 can be<br>
modeled as shown in Figure 2. In Figure 2, the XO-buffer 114 of Figure 1 is modeled<br>
as a differential pair 210 including transistors Ql and Q2. Each collector of transistors<br>
Ql and Q2 is connected to a load resistor, R0, and the emitters of transistors Ql and<br>
Q2 are commonly connected to a constant current source 212. The input of the phase<br>
frequency detector 118 also is shown as a differential pair 220 including transistors<br>
Q3 and Q4 having their collector connected to a load resistor R and their emitters<br>
commonly connected to a constant current source 222. The load resistors R0 of<br>
differential pair 210 and the load resistors R of the phase frequency detector input 220<br>
are connected to the Vcc supply voltage rail 226. The input reference frequency<br>
signal, vxo, from the XO source (in Figure 1, from XO 110 along path 112) is applied<br>
to the buffer input at the bases of transistors Ql and Q2 of differential pair 210.<br><br>
Returning to Figure 1, output signal generated by the XO-buffer is supplied to the input of the<br>
phase frequency detector 118 along path 116. Along this path, interference resulting from<br>
VCO leakage is modeled in Figure 2 as two interfering components 230 and 232. This first<br>
interfering component 230 is represented by voltage source 230 having voltage Va* in series<br>
with the VCc line between the XO-buffer 210 and the input of the PFD 220. The second<br>
interfering component 232 is represented by a three-coil transformer 232 producing inductive<br>
interference voltage vx in series with the path from the XO-buffer output to the PFD input.<br>
When these interfering components 230 and 232 are present, the input signal v/ applied to the<br>
PFD input 220 will be different from the output signal v$ generated by the XO-buffer.<br>
Problems caused by VCO leakage are presently addressed by employing balanced signal<br>
paths in conjunction with circuits having high common-mode and power-supply rejection<br>
ratios (CMRR and PSRR, respectively). Balanced layout schemes are effective in some<br>
respects because they cause most of the interference into the signal path to be common-mode,<br>
and only a small imbalance term, either due to some layout asymmetry or finite CMRR, will<br>
interfere with the reference. Such schemes typically suppress interference in the signal path<br>
by 20 to 40 dB. Interference entering the supply rails will similarly be suppressed by a high<br>
PSRR, typically of the same order as the CMRR. However, with ever-increasing levels of<br>
integration, on-chip distances become smaller and smaller. At the same time, because on-<br>
chip inductors do not scale with the rest of the circuit technology, the relative spacing of<br>
inductors and wires also becomes smaller, further aggravating the inductively coupled<br>
interference. For instance, a GSM frequency synthesizer must have output spurious levels<br>
more than 44 dB below the carrier at a 400 kHz offset, given a loop-filter attenuation of 23<br>
dB at that offset, which corresponds to reference frequency spuriouses below -88 dBc for the<br>
DCS band using a 13 MHz crystal reference. Achieving these spurious frequency levels is<br>
becoming increasingly difficult, even with current layout and circuit techniques. Hence,<br>
there is a need in the art for a more robust reference frequency distribution scheme.<br><br>
Various related documents are known. For example, EP 1349268A2 describes<br>
a large gain range, high linearity, low noise MOS VGS having noise rejection based<br>
on differential design. The article entitled "15 Gbit/s high-gain limiting amplifier<br>
fabricated using Si-bipolar production technology," Moller et al., Electronic Letters,<br>
Vol. 30, No. 18, describes a limiting amplifier with two separate output buffers. JP<br>
9162731 describes the provision of low output impedance logic circuits to terminals<br>
of a transmission line.<br><br>
SUMMARY<br>
It should be emphasized that the terms "comprises" and "comprising," when used in this<br>
specification, are taken to specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps or<br>
components; but the use of these terms does not preclude the presence or addition of one or<br>
more other features, integers, steps, components or groups thereof.<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the invention, a reference frequency distribution apparatus<br>
comprises oscillator for generating a reference frequency signal and a buffer device having an<br>
input connected to an output signal path of the oscillator. The buffer device includes at least<br>
one component spatially located from other components of the buffer to increase the output<br>
impedance as seen from the buffer. Rerouting the location of the buffer component causes<br>
the output impedance of the buffer to suppress undesirable spurious components generated as<br>
a result of RF signal leakage entering into the signal path.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a method of suppressing unwanted signals<br>
along an RF signal path to an input circuit comprises providing subcomponents of a buffer<br>
limiter device in first and second areas of a substrate, and routing an RF signal path from the<br>
output of the buffer device to the input circuit provided in the second area of the circuit<br>
layout. By providing the buffer limiter subcomponents in the second area, the impedance of<br>
the output of the buffer limiter and impedance of the input of the input circuit become<br>
mismatched, thereby suppressing interference introduced into the signal path between the<br>
buffer limiter output and the input circuit input.<br>
Another aspect of the invention concerns a phase locked loop (PLL) circuit that includes a<br>
buffer limiter having an input for receiving a reference frequency signal and an output for<br>
outputting a buffered reference frequency signal. A first low-pass filter is connected in a<br>
signal path between the buffer and a first input of a phase frequency detector. The output of<br>
the phase frequency detector is acted on by a second low-pass filter to produce a filtered<br>
phase detector output. A voltage controlled oscillator, in turn, produces an output signal at a<br>
frequency dependent on the filtered phase detector output. The output signal is received by a<br><br>
frequency divider, which produces a divided frequency signal. In the PLL, the physical<br>
placement of components of the first filter and the buffer cause the output impedance of the<br>
buffer to be greater than the impedance of the first input of the phase frequency detector.<br>
Additional aspects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the description that<br>
follows, and in part will be apparent from the description, or may be learned from practice of<br>
the invention. The aspects and advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by<br>
the system and method particularly pointed out in the written description and claims hereof as<br>
well as in the appended drawings.<br>
It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed<br>
description are exemplary and exemplary only and are not restrictive of the invention, as<br>
claimed.<br>

DETAILED DESCRD7TION<br>
These and other aspects of the invention will now be described in greater detail in connection<br>
with exemplary examples that are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
To arrive at a solution to the interference pickup problems described above, the simplified<br>
model shown in Figure 3 is used to analyze the interference sources depicted in Figure 2. For<br>
the sake of generality, all signals are assumed to be unbalanced, but the result derived is<br>
easily extended to the balanced case (i.e., symmetric or almost symmetric) by applying the<br>
correct amount of cancellation due to PSRR and CMRR. Thus, in the following, only an<br>
unbalanced signal notation is used.<br>
As shown in Figure 3, it, and Vb represent the current and voltage output of the buffer, re-<br>
spectively, and Vj represents the phase-frequency detector (PFD) input voltage. The inductive<br>
signal interference is modeled in Figure 3 by the voltage source, vx, and capacitive (con-<br>
ductive) signal cross talk is represented by the current source ix. The supply interference is<br>
represented by the voltage source vccx, and the buffer output impedance and the PFD input<br>
impedance is represented by R0 and r-„ respectively. It can be shown that<br><br><br>
where frequency dependencies have been left out for simplicity. Normally a buffer is<br>
designed to have low output impedance (i.e. R0 « n) so equation (1) may be simplified as<br>
follows:<br><br>
This strategy reveals that effects of capacitive cross talk can be rninirnized by choosing h<br>
such that ix becomes insignificant. Additionally, it should be apparent that large separations<br>
of the circuit components could cause vx and vccx to be much smaller than it • R0- However,<br>
present and future requirements for increased circuit density make such separations<br>
increasingly difficult, if not impossible to achieve. Hence, another way of suppressing vx and<br>
Vccx must be provided.<br>
The invention addresses interference resulting from RC leakage in a first exemplary way by<br>
changing the impedance levels on the buffer output and the PFD input. For instance, letting<br>
R0»ri, results in:<br><br>
where ix has been neglected because it will not contribute more than in equation (2). From<br>
equation (3), it can be seen that the interference due to vx and vccc will be suppressed by the<br>
ratio R(Jri. It can be seen that the buffer can be made robust to interference due to vx and vccx<br>
by creating an impedance mismatch via a high buffer output impedance.<br>
Figure 4 shows an exemplary way to increase the buffer output impedance relative to the<br>
phase-detector input impedance to achieve a high ratio i?
buffer load resistors R0 are provided physically closer to the inputs of the phase-detector input<br>
420 instead of being provided with the buffer cell 410. Providing the buffer load resistors R0<br>
closer to the PFD inputs increases the buffer output resistance and decreases the input<br><br>
resistance of the PFD, thus suppressing interference due to v* and vcac as can be seen from<br>
equation (3).<br>
For example, RF ASICs typically have a R„ value of approximately 500 mv/1 mA or 500 Q.<br>
The corresponding typical input resistance n ~ j3/gm, or about 2.5 k £1 at 1 mA. (The buffer<br>
and phase-detector input will typically operate at similar current levels for noise reasons.)<br>
When the resistors are moved to the PFD input side, the input resistance of the PFD becomes<br>
r, « Ro, or 500 Q and the buffer output impedance, denoted here as r0, is given by the Early-<br>
voltage, VA&gt; of the transistors Q3 and Q4. A typical Early-voltage VA may be 25 V at a<br>
collector current (Jc) of 1 mA. This translates to a buffer output resistance r0 « VA/IC, or 25 k<br>
CI, yielding an extra vx and vcac interference suppression of 25000/500, or 40 dB.<br>
In the case where interference is already present in the signal path from the reference signal<br>
source, simply relocating the load resistors R0 would not be sufficient to suppress spurious<br>
components arising from the interference. For instance, interference on the reference signal<br>
path may cause a PLL spurious tone in two ways: (1) by subsampling (i.e., folding) of<br>
unwanted tones in the PFD or (2) by intermodulation between the reference signal and<br>
interference tones in the signal-path of the buffer(s) (before the PFD inputs). Hence, an<br>
alternative or additional way would be required to suppress spurious components caused by<br>
subsampling and intermodulation.<br>
In accordance with the invention, suppression of these tones is accomplished in a second way<br>
in which the reference frequency signal is cleaned by filtering. In the following analysis, it is<br>
assumed that interference is caused by interference tones. However, the concepts discussed<br>
below are also valid for noise as well when bearing in mind that increased noise floor or<br>
noise "humps" will be observed instead of distinct PLL spurs associated with interference<br>
tones.<br>
The phase noise caused by the subsampling of the RF at the PFD input is approximately<br>
proportional to the ratio of the reference and interference signal slew rates (when the<br>
interference is much smaller than the reference) at the PFD input. To reduce phase noise, it is<br><br>
known to place a limiting buffer early in the reference path to maximize the reference<br>
signal slew rate while limiting any impact of interference picked up after the buffer.<br>
However, once interference has entered the signal path, simply adding limiters will<br>
not change the slew- rate ratio. In this case, a low-pass filter may be introduced to<br>
suppress the interferer while mimmizing the impact on the reference signal.<br>
Figure 5 is a block diagram of a fractional-N phase locked loop circuit in which a<br>
low-pass filter is used to suppress spurious tones caused by interference in the signal<br>
path of the reference frequency signal in accordance with an exemplary example of<br>
the invention. The PLL depicted may be used, for example, in transmit circuitry of a<br>
communications device such as a mobile phone. Similar circuitry may be used in the<br>
receive circuitry of such a device, for example.<br>
An input reference signal having a frequency^-is supplied to an input of a buffer<br>
520, which limits the amplitude and outputs a square wave signal having steep zero<br>
crossings. The output from the buffer is supplied to a low-pass filter (LPF) 530, which<br>
filters the reference signal and supplies the filtered signal to a first input of a phase<br>
frequency detector (PED) 540. While only one buffer 520 is shown in Figure 5, it is to<br>
be understood that a number of buffer stages and LPFs may be present in the path<br>
between the low pass filter 530 and the PFD 540. The output from the PFD 540 is<br>
filtered in a loop filter 550 and passed to a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) 560,<br>
which supplies an output signal at the VCO output 570. The output from the VCO 560<br>
also is supplied to a frequency divider 580, where it is divided by a division ratio. The<br>
divided output from the frequency divider 580 is supplied along path 590 to a second<br>
input of the PFD 540.<br>
After the first buffer (i.e., a limiter) 520, the output will approach a square wave in<br>
shape. Thus, the impact of a low-pass filter 530 on the signal zero-crossing slew rate<br>
can be estimated by evaluating the filter output peak slew rate when subject to a step<br>
input. The maximum slew rate will be a reasonable approximation of the slew rate in<br>
the zero crossing.<br>
A filter output response can be calculated in the Laplace domain as follows:<br><br><br>
where v,{s) and H(s) is the filter input signal and transfer function, in the s plane, respectively.<br>
The normalized output slew rate due to a step input (i.e., v,{^) = l/s) will then be<br><br>
Assuming an on-chip passive filter, all poles will be real and it may be assumed, for the sake<br>
of simplicity without loss of generality, that all poles coincide. The transfer function of such<br>
an n-pole filter may then be depicted as:<br><br>
where a is the filter pole angular frequency and Ho the low-frequency gain. (See, e.g., John J.<br>
Dt'Azzo and Constantine H. Houpis, Linear Control System Analysis and Design —<br>
conventional and modern, McGraw-Hill, 1981.) The normalized (i.e., a~\ and Ho - 1) time<br>
derivative of the output voltage will then be equal to the filter impulse response, as the<br>
derivative operator and the input signal cancel out, or<br><br>
The peak slew rate is approximately equal to the zero-crossing slew rate and may be<br>
approximated by with less than 35% error for n 
The normalized filter slew rate is proportional to the reciprocal of the filter order. Thus, the<br>
denormalized slew rate will be proportional to the filter pole frequency divided by its order<br>
(i.e., aln). Further, the filter high-frequency attenuation is proportional to (s/a)n = (CORF/O)".<br>
To maximize the slew-rate-attenuation product we should maximize n while minimizing a, as<br>
the attenuation grows faster with n than the slew rate decays. However, due to noise<br>
constraints, the slew rate may not be degraded and one is often forced to choose a much<br>
higher filter pole frequency than what would result in a maximum slew-rate-attenuation<br>
product. A typical choice of pole frequency (i.e., a/2/7t) would be the crystal oscillator<br>
reference frequency,^, often 13 or 26 MHz, times the product of preceding limiter zero-<br>
crossing gains, typically 10m, where m is the number of limiters. In practice, when m<br>
exceeds, for example, 3, the limiters, not the filter, will limit the bandwidth. In this case the<br><br>
filter could probably be skipped as the attenuation will be very small (i.e., CORF ~ a) or the<br>
filter bandwidth could be set to be similar to the limiter bandwidth. However, as will be<br>
shown below, filters are preferably placed after the first limiter, in which case m = 1.<br>
Figures 6a to 6c show exemplary implementations of a low-pass filter between a buffered<br>
reference frequency signal and a phase frequency detector input. It should be appreciated<br>
that the depicted circuits may be part of a PLL, for example, a PLL of a frequency<br>
synthesizer, of a modulator, or some other RF circuitry. Circuit parts shown in Figures 6a to<br>
6c are described above with respect to elements similarly labeled in Figure 4. For instance, .<br>
the function of current sources 612/622, transistors Ql to Q4, and the modeled conductive<br>
and inductive interference 630/632 of Figures 6a to 6c respectively correspond to the<br>
description, above, of current sources 412/422, transistors Ql to Q4, and modeled conductive<br>
and inductive interference 430/432 of Figure 4.<br>
Figure 6a shows a buffer 610 and PFD input 620 of a PLL in which a two-pole low-pass filter<br>
has been added in the signal path before the PFD input. The two-pole low-pass filter of<br>
Figure 6a is a single-ended configuration including two capacitors having a value Cj, two<br>
capacitors having value C2, and resistors (shown valued at RJ2) connected to signal ground.<br>
Other filter topologies could be used, such as active-RC or LRC filters, but should preferably<br>
be of at least second order, have low input impedance, and placed close to the PFD input. A<br>
low-pass filter so arranged increases the inter-stage impedance mismatch, thus lowering the<br>
inductive interference pickup, in addition to the suppressing high-frequency interference and<br>
noise.<br>
It is possible to save some chip area, at the cost of CMRR, by providing one or more pairs of<br>
capacitors and resistors in a differential configuration (e.g., by connecting these components<br>
across signal lines). For example, Figure 6b shows an example of the invention in which a<br>
filtered buffer path has two-poles, one single-ended and one differential. Figure 6c shows an<br>
exemplary filtered buffer path having 3 filter poles, two of which are differential and one<br>
single ended.<br><br>
A limiting buffer has a saturating transfer function. This transfer function is strongly<br>
nonlinear and stabilizes the output signal amplitude (and thus, also the PLL loop gain), while<br>
enhancing the zero-crossing slew rate. When a sinusoidal signal from an oscillator, for<br>
example, a crystal oscillator (XO) producing a signal having an angular frequency coxo, and a<br>
small RF interferer are passed through such a limiter both signal components are subject to<br>
harmonic and intermodulation tone generation. The dominating components are fast<br>
decaying a square wave-like spectrum of the harmonics of crystal oscillator signal and odd-<br>
order intermodulation products around the RF tone. These two signal components can be<br>
expressed as:<br><br>
where vxo\ is the amplitude of the fundamental tone with ct
 <br>
where v^ is the amplitude of the fundamental RF interference tone, respectively.<br>
After one limiter stage the RF intermodulation products fall off fast enough not to cause any<br>
low-frequency spurious components close to the reference signal'fundamental tone.<br>
However, after a second limiter stage (i.e. when the signals have passed through a cascade of<br>
two limiters) the situation is very different. In this case, the amplitudes of the<br>
intermodulation tones around the RF interferer do not fall off appreciably with the distance<br>
from the RF fundamental, as was the case with only one successively connected limiter. The<br>
effect of this spectrum widening is that now intermodulation tones are present very close to<br>
the crystal oscillator fundamental frequency,^ = {coxJ2%), when the RF carrier is chosen to<br>
be an odd multiple of the oscillator frequency^ (e.g., 7l-fX0 + Af ). When an RF carrier is<br>
close to an even multiple of fxo (e.g., 72 • fx0 + Ay), a similar spectrum results, but with the<br>
odd-order intermodulation tones between crystal oscillator harmonics. In either case, it will<br>
be very difficult to remove the intermodulation tones by filtering because filters having very<br>
high Q values would be needed. Such filters would probably be complex active filters or<br>
RLC filters, both variants prone to pick up interference due to large area and/or mutual<br>
inductances to RF-carrying wires.<br><br>
The mechanism behind the intermodulation spectrum widening is that after the first limiter,<br>
the limiter is no longer fed with two sinusoidal signals. The second limiter will see the sum<br>
of two signals described in equations 4 and 5 as input. Now, not only are odd-order<br>
intermodulation components from the two fundamentals present, but all combinations of the<br>
fundamentals plus harmonics and side bands, resulting in the rather flat intermodulation<br>
spectrum around the RF fundamental. The only way to filter out higher-order inter-<br>
modulation products would be to suppress the RF components between the first and second<br>
limiter. When there is several entry points for RF interference, filters should be provided<br>
between limiters following these entry points.<br>
Figure 7 is a block diagram of a signal path including cascaded low-pass filters and buffers in<br>
accordance with the invention. The signal path starts at the XO and buffer frequency signal<br>
distribution apparatus 710. While apparatus 710 is shown as having an XO reference<br>
frequency signal source, the concept of cascading extends to RF type oscillator circuits in<br>
general or other signal sources susceptible to interference from RF leakage. Apparatus 710<br>
outputs a signal having a reference frequency^, which is provided to an input of the low-<br>
pass filter 720. Along this path is an entry point for RF interference Intl. The low-pass filter<br>
720 increases interstage impedance mismatch and filters out the higher-order inter-<br>
modulation components introduced by the interference Intl. The filtered output of the filter<br>
720 is supplied to the input of the buffer limiter 730. If no interference problems are present<br>
in the signal path after buffer 730, additional buffers may be provided in series with the<br>
buffer 730.<br>
Figure 7 illustrates a case where additional interference Int2 is introduced after the output of<br>
the buffer 730. Similar to the low-pass filter 720 and buffer 730, the low-pass filter cleans<br>
the signal and increases impedance mismatch to the next stage. This may be repeated, if<br>
necessary for any number of interference points along the signal path. For instance, Figure 7<br>
shows interference Int3 entering into the signal path after buffer 750, and an additional<br>
cascaded low-pass filter 740 and buffer 750 succeeding this point of entry. As can be seen,<br><br>
practically any number of buffer and filter combinations may be used to suppress interference<br>
and rninimize its impact on the signal.<br>
The foregoing derivation has largely neglected frequency dependent effects in the<br>
derivations, but these could easily be inferred by those skilled in the art. The invention has<br>
been described with reference to particular examples. However, it will be readily apparent to<br>
those skilled in the art that it is possible to embody the invention in specific forms other than<br>
those of the preferred embodiment described above. This may be done without departing<br>
from the spirit of the invention.<br>
For example, while the foregoing examples describe bipolar-based circuits, the same<br>
principles could be applied to other technologies, for example CMOS. While the above-<br>
described examples concern paths within a crystal oscillator signal path of a PLL, the use of<br>
these techniques is not limited to this path and could be applied to other sensitive paths as<br>
well. In particular the PFD feedback path shares the same sensitivity as its input. For<br>
example, with reference to Figure 5, the invention can be used to suppress spurious<br>
components entering along path 590. Depending on layout distances, the presented principle<br>
could be applied to this signal path as well. Additionally, the present invention is not limited<br>
to use in PLL circuits, but can be used in other RF circuits requiring a reference frequency<br>
signal. For example, the invention can be used to suppress spurious components in mixer<br>
circuits, waveform generators, and in other circuits requiring a suppression of undesirable<br>
spurious components.<br>
By rerouting some of the buffer components a substantial suppression of inductive and<br>
supply induced interference components can be achieved. A suppression ratio of<br>
approximately 40 dB can be expected without impacting the normal operation of the buffer<br>
chain. By also adding filtering, further suppression can be achieved and/or the generation of<br>
intermodulation products be prevented. The cost in chip real estate is essentially zero when<br>
not employing filters, and should be very small when filters are used. The extra interference<br>
margin will reduce the spurious levels significantly, possibly saving one or more ASIC re-<br>
spins. The invention is applicable to both balanced and single-ended signals.<br><br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be<br>
made in the reference frequency distribution methods and configurations of the present<br>
invention without departing from the spirit and scope thereof. Thus, it is intended that the<br>
present invention cover the modifications of this invention provided they come within the<br>
