				<td>A new process for the preparation of phenolic hydroxy-substituted compounds<br>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of a phenolic hydroxy-substituted<br>
ompound of the general formula (I) by desalkylation of an alkyl aryl ether of the general<br>
3rmula (H) by treatment with a tMoiirea/aluminium chloride reagent pair.<br><br>
- in said general formulae R stands for straight chain or branched Ci_g alkyl group; R2, R3, R4,<br>
R5, and R6 have the same or different meanings and stand for hydrogen or halogen atom,<br>
hydroxy, carboxy, nitro, oxo, C]^ alkylcarbonyl, straight chain or branched alkyl or - alkoxy,<br>
or aryl group, or R" and R together may stand for a 5-7 membered ring or a fused ring<br>
system; said 5-7 membered ring may be a partially saturated ring optionally substituted with<br>
an oxo group or can be an unsaturated ring; or said fused ring system may constitute with the<br><br>
first ring a steroid, preferably an estratricne derivative optionally substituted with an oxo or<br>
C]^ alkylcarbonyloxy group in the 17 position -.<br>
Since the phenolic hydroxy is susceptible both to oxidation and to nucleophilic<br>
reactions, it is usually brought into temporality protected form in the course of the synthesis.<br>
Various protective groups are known of which those protecting the hydroxy in the form of an<br>
ether, e. g. in the form of alkoxy, particularly methoxy are preferred, since these arc<br>
easy-to-prcpare and the protection is broad in scope. The drawback of this method, however,<br>
is that protective group can only be removed under drastic reaction conditions.<br>
For demethylation of the alkyl aryl ethers various reactions and reagents arc known of<br>
which - without the aim of completeness - those used most frequently are listed below:<br>
Demethylation of mcthoxybcnzcnc by aluminium chloride (AlClj) was described in<br>
1944. The drawback of this method is that during the reaction poisouous methyl chloride gas<br>
developed; what is more, depending on the molar ratio of the starting material and the AICI3,<br>
the aromatic ring became methylated to different extent (Baddeley, G.: J. Chem. Soc., p. 330,<br>
1944).<br>
Acidic cleavage of die ether bond by hydrogen iodide (HI) (Coombs, M. M. and<br>
Roderick, H. R.: Steroids, Vol. 6, p. 841, 1965) or by boron tribromide (BBr3) (Bhatt, M. V.<br>
and Kulkarni. S. U.: Synthesis, p. 249, 1983) is also known. However, corrosive properties<br>
and high prices of these reagents are against the industrial application of both processes.<br>
The regioselective demethylation of polymefhoxy benzaldcliide by aluminium chloride<br>
was studied in benzene. The use of benzene, however, makes difficult the industrial<br>
application (Paul, E. G. and Wang, P. S.-C: J. Org. Chcm., Vol. 44, p. 2307, 1979). No<br>
mention happens in this publication to demediylatiou of alkyl groups other than methyl,<br>
neither to the demethylation of fused ring aromatic ethers or steroids.<br>
Demethylation by pyridine hydrochloride requires extreme reaction conditions (180-<br>
220 Â°C) (Groen, M. B. and Zeclen, F. J.: Tetrahedron Letters, Vol. 23, p. 3611, 1982).<br>
Regioselective cleavage of ihc ether bond by aluminium iodide (AII3) in acetonrjilc<br>
was describee" by Bhatt, M. V. and Babu, J. R. Tetrahedron Letters, Vol. 25, p. 3497, 1984,<br>
and the same effect was found by Node. M. et al when they used aluminium chloride/sodium<br>
iodide reagent pair (Chem. Pharra. Bull., Vol. 31, p. 4178. 1983).<br>
The effect of trimethylsily! iodide reagent [(Me)3Sii) on several ethers was studied by<br>
Jung, M E. and Lister, M. A. (J. Org. Chcm . Vol. 42, p. 3761, J 977), while Wir.terfcldt, E.<br><br>
(Synthesis, p. 617, 1975) used diisobutylalumiaium hydride reagent (DIBAH) in his<br>
experiments.<br>
Stein, R. P. et al used methylmagnesium iodide (MeMgl) for the demethylation of acid<br>
sensitive steroids (Tetrahedron, Vol. 26, p 1917 (1970)), while Wunderwaldt, M. et al<br>
demethylated 3-methoxyestra-l,3,5(10)-triene derivatives substituted on the D-ring by<br>
treatment with a potassium-tert-butoxide/ethanethiol (KOCMe3/EtSH) reagent pair (Z. Chem.,<br>
Vol. 21, p. 145,1981). In the latter case hexamethylphoshorous triamide (HMPT) was used as<br>
solvent.<br>
An interesting reagent pair, i. e. a 2,3,11,12-dicyclohexano-1,4,7,10,13,15-<br>
hexaoxacyclooctadecane/potassium pair (or otherwise: dicyclohexano-18-crown-6/potassium)<br>
was used by Ohsawa, T. et al (Tetrahedron Letters, Vol. 33, p. 5555, 1992) to demethylate<br>
anisole-derivatives and the products were obtained with good yields.<br>
Andre, J. D. et al demethylated opiate derivatives by using a methanesulfonic acid<br>
(MeS03H)/methionine (a-amino-y-methyl-rnercaptobutyric acid) reagent pair with success<br>
(Syn. Commun., Vol. 22. p. 2313, 1992). However, the high price of the methanesulfonic acid<br>
and that it was used in a 30-fold excess is against its industrial application.<br>
Of the processes listed above the best yields for the ether bond cleavage could be<br>
achieved when BBr3 in dichloromethane, DEBAH in toluene, as well as when KOCMe3/EtSH<br>
or dicyclohexano-18-crown-6/potassium reagent pairs were used.<br>
The processes reviewed above are common in that their plant scale realisations are not<br>
without difficulties: the reagents are expensive and the reactions require extreme conditions<br>
and/or result in poor yields.<br>
The application of a "strong acid/weak nucleophil" reagent pair brought a<br>
break-through to the ether-desalkylation technique. In the so called Fujita-method a Lewis<br>
acid (a metal halogenide) and - as weak nucleophil - EtSH were used.<br>
Of the reagent pairs of this type the boron trifluoride diethyl etherate, the AlCls/EtSH<br>
and the aluminium bromide (AlBr3)/EtSH gave the most promising results (Node, M. et al: J.<br>
Org. Chem., Vol. 45, p. 4275, 1980). Considering the necessary reaction conditions, the safe<br>
application of the reagents and last but no least the price of the reagents, it is only the<br>
AlCl3/EtSH reagent pair used in the Fujita ether cleavage process which can be realised with<br>
proper yield and at reasonable cost in plant scale. Besides the advantages, this process has<br>
several drawbacks: the AlChlEtSR reagent pair should be used in 3-6 fold excess based on<br><br>
the amount of the ether to be dernethylated; when the reaction is finished the excess EtSH<br>
(which is used also as a solvent for the reaction) and the ethyl methyl thioether (which<br>
presumably is formed in the reaction) should be eliminated by oxidation; the thio compounds<br>
used and formed in the reaction have low boiling points and have disagreeable odor also in<br>
low concentrations, causing additional costs to provide environmentally acceptable operation<br>
and any fault of the operation may result in air pollution.<br>
To avoid problems arising from the penetrating odor, recently efforts have been made<br>
to improve the methods working with alkylthiol and arilthiol reagents to cleave the ether<br>
bond. According to Node's version (Node, M. et al: Tetrahedron Letters, Vol. 42, p. 9207,<br>
2001) the penetrating EtSH could be replaced by the odorless 1-dodccanethiol (lauryl<br>
mcrcaptan) among others in the Fujita method. This publication mentions only the yield,<br>
which is excellent, but no other details arc given.<br>
At the first sight the use of the 1-dodecanethiol seems attractive, but when plant scale<br>
implication is considered, several questions come up. The 1-dodecanethiol is sparingly soluble<br>
in water (0.01 g in 100 g water) but is readily soluble in organic solvents, causing that during<br>
the work up of the reaction mixture with an aqueous treatment, it is contained in the same<br>
phase as the product, i. e. an additional separation step is necessary to remove it. The same<br>
applies to the 1-dodecanc methyl thioether formed in the reaction. On the other hand, the<br>
1-dodecanethiol is a surfactant (a property, inherent in its structure), which may cause<br>
difficulties in the phase separation step.<br>
The data (reagent, solvent, temperature, time, yield and reference) of the most<br>
important reactions for the desalkylation of ethers are shown in Table 1 below.<br><br><br><br>

To sum up the literature data it can be said that the Fujita method is the most suitable<br>
for plant scale desalkylation of alkyl aryl ethers (item N in Table 1). This process, however,<br>
has an unquestionable disadvantage: the use of the thiol reagents with intense, disagreeable<br>
odor.<br>
Since in the pharmaceutical industry desalkylation is a frequently used procedure and<br>
the processes listed above go with difficulties at plant scale (expensive reagents, extreme<br>
reaction conditions, low yield, intensive odor penetrating into die air), our aim is to provide a<br>
' new desalkylation process without the use of alkanethiols,!<br>
Our invention is based on that we have found that thiourea and AICI3 form together a<br>
reagent pair. It is a colorless and odorless liquid with moderate viscosity which is readily<br>
soluble in certain organic solvents (e. g. in dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, chloroform,<br>
benzene, toluene, xilene) while insoluble in 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethylene.<br>
Further experiments showed that the reagent pair containing the thiourea and AICI3 in<br>
equimolar amount can dissolve excess of AICI3 too (0.5-1.5 mol AICI3 is present as excess).<br>
This is an advantage when said reagent pair is used in a desalkylation process according to the<br><br>
invention; namely we have found that in the thiourea/AlCls reagent pair the sulphur atom acts<br>
as a weak nucleophil and is capable of cleaving a methyl group from a mcthoxy, similarly to<br>
the AlCls/EtSII reagent.<br>
In a pilot experiment the 17ft-acetoxyestr^-l,3,5,(10)-tricnc-3-ol of the formula^(nT),<br>
an intermediate used in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals was prepared<br><br>
by the demethylation of 3p-niethoxy-17 J3-acctoxycstra-l,3,5(10&gt;-triene of the formula (IV) /<br><br>
. t . â¢<br>
without the use of an alkancthiol reagent.	 't	'<br>
The new process according to the invention gives 17P:acetoxiestra-l,3,5(10)tricnc-<br>
-3-ol of the formula (III) in good yield and high purity by dcmethylatior. of 3[i-methoxy-17 p-<br><br>
-acetoxyestra-l,3,5(10)-triene of the formula (IV) by treatment with the thiourea/AJCb<br>
reagent pair.<br>
Next, another steroid, the 3 pMiydroxyestra-l,3,5(10)-triene-17-one of the formula (V),<br>
also an intermediate in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals was prepared,<br><br>
by demethylation of the 3p,-methoxyestra-l,3.5(10)-trienc-17-one of the formula (VT), by<br>
treatment with thiourea/AlCb reagent pair.<br><br>
hi a study we subjected several other compounds to demethylation by using the<br>
thiourea/AlCh reagent pair of the invention and found that the process utilizing<br>
thiourea/AlCh can be extended to the preparation of various substituted phenols and<br>
naphthols. In all the reactions snidicd the appropriate, phenolic hydroxy-substitutcd<br>
compounds were obtained and successfully recovered.<br>
Further, we have found that these phenolic hydroxy-substituted compounds can be<br>
prepared not only by demethylation but also by dcsalkylation (1. e. by the removal of a LYs<br><br>
alkyl group from the corresponding starting material) by using the thiourea/AlCb reagent<br>
pair.<br>
Thus, in our experiments we have found that the new deniethylation process using the<br>
thiourca/AlCl3 reagent pair for the preparation of 17p-acetoxyestra-l,3-5(10)-trienc-3-ol of<br>
the formula (III) can be extended for the preparation of a phenolic hydroxy-substituied<br>
compound of the general formula (I) by desalkylation of an alkyl aryl ether of the general<br>
formula (II) by treatment with a thiourea/aluminium chloride reagent pair.<br><br>
- in said general formulae R1 stands for straight chain or branched Ci
R'. and R6 have the same or different meanings and stand for hydrogen or halogen atom,<br>
hydroxy, carboxy, nitro, oxo, C].fc alkylcarbonyl, straight chain or branched alkyl or - alkoxy,<br>
cr aryl group, or R~ and R" together may stand for a 5-7 membered ring or a fused ring<br>
system; said 5-7 membered ring may be a partially saturated ring optionally substituted with<br>
an oxo group or can be an unsaturated ring; or said fused ring system may constitute with the<br><br>
first ring a steroid, preferably an estratricne derivative optionally substituted with an e.xo or<br>
C]_6 alkylcarbonyloxy group in tlie 17 position -.<br>
The new process has several advantages, i. e. the products are obtained with good<br>
yields and purity; die process is easy to realize in plant scale, can be operated in an<br>
environmentally acceptable fashion in a manner not known is the art to avoid the use of<br>
substances having disagreeable odor.<br>
We have found only one reference concerning the thiourea/AICI3 reagent pair. It's the<br>
Soviet patent application No. 603 395 (priority data: 1976. 11. 22 - SU - 2421790) which<br>
discloses that burning metals, such as aluminium and magnesium can be extinguished with a<br>
"thiourea / aluminium chloride compound" prepared by mixing its components in cquimolar<br>
ratio at a temperature below 50 Â°C; said compound is a homogenous, transparent liquid with<br>
moderate viscosity and certain physical characteristics are also given. It is also mentioned that<br>
said compound has been previously used in spectroscopy as model substance to detect the<br>
existence of chemical association.<br>
No mention happens in the technical literature to that by using the thiourea/AlCl3<br>
reagent pair the phenolic hydroxy-substituted compounds of the general formula (I) can be<br>
prepared from the aryl a'kyl ethers of the general formula (II) whereby the compound of the<br>
general formula (II) is desalkylatcd (or in other words: the phenolic hydroxy of the compound<br>
is liberated), nor is mentioned diat the use of me diiourea/AJCb can be advantageous in<br>
organic reactions.<br>
Accordingly, the object of the invention is process for the preparation of a phenolic<br>
hydroxy-substituted compound of the general formula (I) by desalkylation of an alkyl aryl<br>
ether of the general formuia (II) by treatment with a thiourca/aluminium chloride reagent pair.<br><br><br><br>
- in said general formulae R1 stands for straight ciiain or branched Cj^alkyl group; R2, R\ R4,<br>
R5, and R6 have the same or different meanings and stand for hydrogen or halogen atom,<br>

or aryl group, or R~ and R together may stand for a 5-7 membered ring or fused ring system;<br>
said 5-7 membered ring may be a partially saturated ring optionally substituted with an oxo<br>
group or can be an unsaturated ring; or said fjscd ring system may constitute with the first<br>
ring a steroid, preferably an estratriene derivative optionally substituted with an oxo or Cj.$<br>
aLkylcarbonyloxy group in the 17 position -.<br>

branched Ci-6 alkyl group, such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl or n-butyl group.<br>
In the compounds of the general formulae (I) and (II) R2, R3. R4, R5 and R6 may stand<br>
for halogen atom, such as chloride, bromide, iodine or fluorine atom.<br>
In the compounds of the general formulae (I) and (II) R2, R3, R4, R5 and R6 when are<br>
defined as an alkylcarbonyl group, may mean a straiglit chain or branched Cl-6 alkylcarbonyl<br>
group, such as methylcarbonyl, ethylcarbonyl, n-propylcarbonyl, isopropylcarbonyl,<br>
n-butylcarbonyl, tertiarybutylcarbonyl group.<br>
In the compounds of the general formulae (I) and (IT) R2, R3, R4, R5 and Rs when are<br>
defined as straight chain or branched Cj.0 alkyl group, may mean e. g. methyl, ethyl, n-propyl,<br>
isopropyl, n-butyl, tertiarybutyi group.<br>
In the compounds of the general formulae (I) and (II) R2, R3, R4, R5 and R6 when are<br>
defined as straight chain or branched Ci^j alkoxy group, may mean e. g. methoxy, cthoxy,<br>
n propoxy, isopropoxy, n-butoxy, tcrtiarybutoxy group.<br><br>
In the compounds of the general formulae (I) and (II) R2, R3, R\ R5 and R6 may stand<br>
for an aryl group, such as a phenyi or benzyl group.<br>
In the compounds of the general formulae (I) and (IT) R2, R3 together may stand for an<br>
unsaturated or a partially saturated 5-7 membered ring constituting with the original ring a<br>
fused ring system, such as naphthalene or 5,6,7,8-tetrahydronaphthalene.<br>
When in the compounds of the general formulae (I) and (IT) R7, R3 together may stand<br>
for a fused ring system, the fused ring system may constitute with the first ring a steroid,<br>
preferably an estratriene derivative optionally substituted with an oxo or C\4<br>
alkylcarbonyloxy group in the 17 position; - said alkylcarbonyloxy is a straight or branched<br>
Ci-Â« alkylcarbonyloxy, such as methylcarbonyloxy, ethylcarbonyloxy, n-propylcarbonyloxy,<br>
Lsopropylcarbonyloxy, n-butylcarbonyloxy, tcrtiarybutylcarbonyloxy. Such estratrienc<br>
derivative may be e. g. the 17P-acetoxyestra-l,3,5(10)-triene-3-ol of the formula (III) or the<br>
3|Vhydroxyestra-l,3,5(10)-tricne-17-oncof the formula (V).<br>
It is to be mentioned that the 17P-acetoxycstra-l,3,5(10)-triene-3-ol or by other name:<br>
estradiol-17{5-acetate of the formula (III) is an early intermediate for the synthesis of estradiol<br>

17o-ethynylestra-l,3^(10)-triene-3,17p-diol), which are the estrogenic components of<br>
pharmaceutical compositions used for contraception and for the treatment of hormone<br>
deficiency.<br>
The detailed description of the invention is as follows:<br>
The term "room temperature" means a temperature ranging about from 20 Â°C to 25 Â°C.<br>
The phenolic hydroxy-substituted compounds of the general formula (I) according to<br>
the invention are prepared from the alkyl aryl ethers of the general formula (II) usually in<br>
such a manner that the thiourea in an amount of 1-3 mol equivalent per ether group is mixed<br>
with 1-6 mol equivalent of A1C13. The reaction with the careful exclusion of moisture isÂ«C<br>
carried out without the use of a solvent, or in a suitable solvent, such as dichloromcthane,<br>
1,2-dichloroethane, chloroform, benzene, toluene, xilcnc, 1,1,2,2-tctrachlorocthanc,<br>
1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethylene. Tr.t mixture is stirred for a short time at 100 rpm and then to the<br>
reagent pair formed (a liquid), 1 mol equivalent amount of the alkyl aryl ether of the general<br>
formula (II) is added.<br>
The addition order of the reaction components is interchangeable.<br><br>
The reaction mixture is heated to 40-100 Â°C and is maintained at this temperature for<br>
1-3 hours. Then the mixture is cooled and 5 wt % hydrochloride acid is added. In some cases<br>
the product is simply filterable. When the product is remained in a solution, the aqueous layer<br>
is extracted by the appropriate solvent, and the organic layer so obtained is washed with<br>
alkali, 1-5 wt % sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate or sodium bicarbonate to rccovere the<br>
product The pH of the alkaline aqueous layer is adjusted to be acidic, the precipitated<br>
phenolic product is recovered by filtration or if necessary extraction followed by evaporation.<br>
