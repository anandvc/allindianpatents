				<td>PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF A PARTICULATE BIMODAL POLYETHYLENE<br>
PRODUCT<br>
Technical field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a particulate bimodal polyethylene product, in particular polyethylene having a controlled particle size. According to the invention, polyethylene products with a bimodal molecular weight distribution are prepared in a polymerization loop system comprising a double loop reactor, wherein the polymerization is catalyzed by a supported metallocene-alumoxane catalyst.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Polyethylene resins having bimodal characteristics include resins that comprise two components having different properties, such as for instance two components of different molecular weight, i.e. a component with a relatively higher molecular weight component (HMW) and a component with a lower molecular weight (LMW) component; two components of different densities; and/or two components having different productivities or reaction rates with respect to co-monomer.<br>
The use of metallocene catalysts for polymerization and copolymerization of ethylene is a relatively recent development. Processes for producing bimodal polyolefins in general and bimodal polyethylene in particular in the presence of metallocene catalysts have been described.<br>
Bimodal polyethylene resins can be prepared according to different methods. Bimodal polyethylene products can for instance be made by physically blending different monomodal polyethylene products, which are independently produced. However, a problem with those physically produced bimodal products is that they usually contain high levels of gels.<br>
Bimodal polyethylene can also be produced by combining two different catalyst systems in a single reactor, as is described for instance in WO 2006/045738. Altematively, a single dual site catalyst system can be used to produce bimodal polyethylene in a single reactor, as is described for instance in WO 2004/029101.<br>
In addition to producing bimodal polyethylene in a single reactor, bimodal polyethylene can also be produced in serially connected reactors. For instance, WO 02/28922 describes a process for the production of bimodal polyethylene comprising producing a first polyethylene fraction in a first slurry loop reactor and producing a second<br>
2<br>
 <br>
polyethylene fraction in a second slun7 loop reactor, serially connected to the first reactor, wherein the first polyethylene fraction is passed from the first reactor to the second reactor, and wherein the molecular weight of the polyethylene fractions in the first and second reactors is different. Depending on the desired product characteristics, catalysts features and/or reaction conditions can be adapted in such processes.<br>
However, using metallocene-based catalyst systems to catalyze the preparation of bimodal polyolefins such as bimodal polyethylene, results in polymer fractions that may be difficult to mix with one another, in particular when bimodal polyolefins are produced in separate reactors. A problem associated with known bimodal polyethylene products is that if the individual polyethylene components are too different in molecular weight and density, they may not be homogeneously mixed with each other as desired. As a consequence harsh extrusion conditions or repeated extrusions are sometimes necessary which might lead to partial degradation of the final product and/or additional cost. Thus the optimum mechanical and processing properties are not achieved in the final polyethylene product. Also, bimodal polymer particles produced may not be sufficie.'ntly uniform In size, and hence segregation of polymer during storage and transfer can produce non-homogeneous products.<br>
Another problem with known bimodal polyolefins is that defects sometimes are visible in the finished product where the catalyst used in the olefin polymerization is a metallocene catalyst. In particular, dots or specks and/or rough patches sometimes are visible on the surface of products, e.g. tubes or pipe, made from pellets of a bimodal product that were produced using a metallocene catalyst. Such defects can make the pipe weaker and can affect the free flow of liquid through the pipe. This type of defect may occur because of homogenization problems in the extruder.<br>
Thus, many applications still require improved miscibility of the polyolefin components of a bimodal polyolefin product such that in turn the mechanical and processing properties of the polyolefins, and in particular polyethylene, can be further improved.<br>
In view of the above, there remains a need in the art to provide an improved polymerization process for making bimodal polyolefin resin, and in particular polyethylene, which overcomes at least some of the above-mentioned problems.<br>

Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention provides a process for preparing bimodal polyethylene that is carried out in the presence of a supported metallocene-alumoxane catalyst system in two liquid full loop reactors connected in series wherein different molecular weight fractions are produced. The present invention relates in particular to a process for preparing bimodal polyethylene having improved polymer granulometry and morphology, and in particular having a median particle diameter of less than 300 pm. The present process is at least in part based on the use of a supported metallocene-alumoxane catalyst having a controlled particle size, and in particular a median particle diameter of less than 50pm.<br>
The process according to the invention permits to prepare bimodal polyethylene that is easier to homogenize during extrusion, and hence that provides less defects when further processed into a final product.<br>
Thereto, the invention relates in a first aspect to a process for the preparation of a particulate bimodal polyethylene product in a serially connected double loop reactor, comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	feeding ethylene monomer, a liquid hydrocarbon diluent, at least one polymerization catalyst, optionally hydrogen, and optionally one or more olefin co-monomers to a first loop reactor;<br>
(b)	polymerizing said ethylene and said optionally one or more olefin co-monomers in said first loop reactor to produce a first polyethylene product;<br>
(c)	transferring said first polyethylene product to a second loop reactor;<br>
(d)	feeding ethylene monomer, a diluent, optionally hydrogen, and optionally one or more olefin co-monomers to said second loop reactor;<br>
(e)	polymerizing said ethylene and said optionally one or more olefin co-monomers in said second loop reactor in the presence of said first polyethylene product to produce a bimodal polyethylene product;<br>
(f)	recovering from said second loop reactor said bimodal polyethylene product having a median particle diameter of less than 300 pm,<br>
wherein said polymerization catalyst comprises a particulate metallocene-alumoxane catalyst immobilized on a porous silica support, and wherein said polymerization catalyst has a median particle diameter of less than 50 pm, and<br>
whereby the rafio of the median particle diameter of said bimodal polyethylene product to the median particle diameter of said polymerization catalyst is less than 30.<br>
4<br>
 <br>
In another embodiment, the invention relates to a process as described above, wherein said bimodal polyethylene product comprises at least two different polyethylene fractions, whereby one of said fractions has a higher molecular weight than said other fraction and wherein each of said polyethylene fractions has a polydispersity index of maximum 5, and wherein said bimodal polyethylene product has a polydispersity index which is greater than the largest polydispersity index of said polyethylene fractions.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the invention also relates to a process as described above, wherein the polyethylene fraction having said higher molecular weight has a high load melt index (HLMI; ASTM-D1238, 190°C, 21.6 kg) comprised between 0.01 g/10 min and 10 g/10 min and wherein said bimodal polyethylene product has a HLMI higher than 3 g/10 min.<br>
Accordingly, the invention relates to a process for producing a bimodal polyethylene product of which the polyethylene fractions have clearly distinguishable but overlapping molecular weight distributions, but wherein polyethylene fractions present within the bimodal polyethylene product can be optimally mixed and homogenized during further processing of the bimodal product, resulting in an end product having improved homogeneity. Homogeneity of polymer resins can be determined by optical techniques known to a skilled person, such as for instance by microscopic analyses.<br>
The catalysts which are used in the process according to the invention are metallocene-based catalysts, which have controlled granulometry and properties. More in particular, said metallocene-based catalysts include particulate catalysts comprising a metallocene and an alumoxane which are provided on silica porous support. Moreover, the present invention provides a process wherein the polymerization catalyst has a median particle diameter of less than 50 pm.<br>
[0018] In an embodiment, the invention relates to a process as described above wherein said metallocene has formula (I) or (II)<br>
(Ar)2MQ2 (I) for non-bridged metallocenes; or<br>
R"(Ar)2MQ2 (II) for bridged metallocenes<br>
wherein each Ar is independently selected from the group consisting of cyclopentadienyl, indenyl, tetrahydroindenyl, and fluorenyl; and wherein Ar is optionally substituted with one or more substituents each independently selected from the group consisting of halogen, a hydrosilyl, a SiRa wherein R is a hydrocarbyl having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, and a hydrocarbyl having 1 to 20 carbon atoms and wherein said hydrocarbyl optionally contains one or more atoms selected from the group comprising B, Si, S, O, F, CI and P;<br>
5<br>
 <br>
wherein M is a transition metal selected from the group consisting of titanium, zirconium, hafnium and vanadium;<br>
wherein each Q is independently selected from the group consisting of halogen; a hydrocarix)xy having 1 to 20 carbon atoms; and a hydrocarbyl having 1 to 20 carbon atoms wherein said hydrocarbyl optionally contains one or more atoms selected from the group comprising B, Si, S, O, F, CI and P;<br>
wherein R" is a bridge between the two Ar and selected from the group consisting of a Ci-C20 alkylene, a gennanium, a silicon, a siloxane, an alkylphosphine and an amine, wherein said R" is optionally substituted with one or more substituents each independently selected from the group consisting of halogen, a hydrosilyl, a SiRa wherein R is a hydrocarbyl having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, and a hydrocarbyl having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, and wherein said hydrocarbyl optionally contains one or more atoms selected from the group comprising B, Si, S, O, F, CI and P.<br>
In a further embodiment, the invention relates to a process as described above wherein said alumoxane has formula (III) or (IV)<br>
R-(AI(R)-0)x-AIR2 (III) for oligomeric, linear alumoxanes; or (-AI(R)-0-)y (IV) for oligomeric, cyclic alumoxanes wherein x is 1-40, y is 3-40, and each R is independently selected from a Ci-Cs alkyl.<br>
In a preferred emtwdiment, the invention relates to a process as described above wherein M is zirconium. In other words, in a preferred embodiment, said metallocene comprises the transition metal zirconium.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the invention relates to a process as described above whsrein the alumoxane is methylalumoxane.<br>
In a further embodiment, a process is provided wherein the molar ratio of aluminum, provided by said alumoxane, to transition metal, provided by said metallocene, in said polymerization catalyst is between 10 and 1000, and preferably between 50 and 500.<br>
The present process results in a bimodal product showing improved miscibility of the individual polyethylene components, and in turn bimodal polyethylene having improved mechanical and processing properties is provided. The Applicants have now found that by controlling the properties of the polymerisation catalyst, and in particular by using a . polymerisation catalyst of a smaller size or diameter a bimodal polyethylene product have controlled particle size or diameter and improved features could be obtained, and in particular having improved homogenization characteristics. Moreover, products prepared<br>
6<br>
 <br>
with a bimodal polyethylene resin obtained when carrying out a process according to the present invention show less defects.<br>
In accordance with the present process, by controlling the properties and the diameter of the polymerization catalyst, the diameter of the polymer particles in the produced polyethylene resin also is smaller, in particular smaller than SOOpm. This has been found to have the benefit of improved and easier homogenisation of the bimodal polymer during extrusion because the bimodal resin is able to be fully molten. The results obtained in accordance with the present invention are unexpected as prior art teachings suggest that a smaller polymer particle size would be disadvantageous since such polymer would be more difficult to flow through an extruder and thus more difficult to homogenise. It was also accepted that smaller resin particles would result in a lower settling efficiency.<br>
The Applicants have shown that there is a correlation between the catalyst structure and polymer properties. The present process permits to prepare bimodal polyethylene having suitable properties, including a suitable particle diameter distribution and a suitable molecular weight distribution, in the presence of metallocene-based catalyst systems by adequate control of the catalyst structure, including its morphology and granulometry. The physical form of the final polymer product is in accordance with the present process controlled by the properties and structure of the catalyst. In addition, the present process also provides control over reactor operability and therefore represents an improvement over the existing art.<br>
The invention further provides a process for preparing bimodal p)olyethylene, wherein polyethylene product granulometry has been improved, and therefore also provides a bimodal polyethylene product showing improved miscibility of the polyethylene fractions contained in the final bimodal product. The present invention thus pennits to provide bimodal polyethylene product of controlled particle size or diameter, and of controlled molecular weight distribution.<br>
In another aspect, the invention relates to a bimodal polyethylene product obtainable or obtained by carrying out the process according to the present invention.<br>
With the insight to better show the characteristics of the invention, some preferred embodiments and examples are described hereafter.<br>

In a particular embodiment, "bimodal polyethylene" as used herein may refer to polyethylene comprising at least two fractions of ethylene polymer wherein one fraction has a lower molecular weight (LMW fraction) than the other fraction (HWM fraction. According to the invention, bimodal polyethylene is pn^duced in a sequential step process, utilizing polymerization reactors coupled in series and using different conditions in each reactor, the different fractions produced in the different reactors will each have their own molecular weight. Hence, the resulting polyethylene product is a bimodal polyethylene product.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, ethylene polymerization includes but is not limited to homopolymerization of ethylene, copolymerization of ethylene and a higher 1-olefin co-monomer such as 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-octene or 1-decene. In a particulariy preferred embodiment of the present invention, said co-monomer is 1-hexene.<br>

10<br>
 <br>
hydrogen and optionally other additives, thereby producing polymerization slurry comprising bimodal polyethylene.<br>
As used herein, the term "polymerization slurry" or "polymer slurry" or "slurry" means substantially a multi-phase composition including at least polymer solids and a liquid phase, the liquid phase being the continuous phase. The solids include catalyst and a polymerized olefin, such as polyethylene. The liquids include an inert diluent, such as isobutane, dissolved monomer such as ethylene, co-monomer, molecular weight control agents, such as hydrogen, antistatic agents, antifouling agents, scavengers, and other process additives.<br>

Non-limiting illustrative examples of solvents are butane, isobutane, pentane, hexane, heptane, cyclopentane, cyclohexane, cycloheptane, methyl cyclopentane, methyl cyclohexane, isooctane, benzene, toluene, xylene, chloroform, chlorobenzenes, tetrachloroethylene, dichloroethane and trichloroethane. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, said diluent is isobutane. However, it should be clear from the present invention that other diluents may as well be applied according to the present invention.<br>
As used the person skilled in the art will appreciate that the nature, amounts and concentrations of the above given monomers, co-monomers, polymerisation catalyst and additional compounds for the polymerization as well as the polymerization time and reaction conditions in each reactor can vary depending on the desired bimodal polyethylene product.<br>
The present process is in particular characterised in that it is carried out in the presence of a polymerization catalyst that comprises a particulate metallocene-alumoxane catalyst immobilized on a porous support or carrier. As used herein, the polymerization catalyst is a free-flowing and particulate catalyst structure in a form comprising dry particles. Methods for manufacturing of supported metallocene-alumoxane catalysts are known in the art and will therefore not be disclosed in detail herein.<br>
In an embodiment, the invention provides a process for the preparation of a particulate bimodal polyethylene product in a serially connected double loop reactor, comprising the steps of:<br>

Most preferred is silica. The silica may be in granular, agglomerated, fumed or other form.<br>
Prior to its use, if desired, the support material may be subjected to a heat treatment and/or chemical treatment to reduce the water content or the hydroxyl content of the support material. Typical thermal pretreatments are carried out at a temperature from 30 to 1000 °C for a durafion of 10 minutes to 50 hours in an inert atmosphere or under reduced pressure.<br>
