				<td>A METHOD OF WRAPPING A PRODUCT AND MACHINE<br>
The present invention relates to a method of wrapping products.<br>
More specifically, the present invention relates to a method of wrapping groups of packets of cigarettes, to which the following description refers purely by way of example.<br>
Groups of packets of cigarettes are normally wrapped by feeding each group to a cartooning machine, wrapping the group in a respective first wrapping comprising a sheet of wrapping material, e.g. semirigid cardboard, to form a respective carton of packets, and then transferring the carton to an overwrapping machine and overwrapping the carton in a respective second wrapping comprising a sheet of overwrapping material folded about the first wrapping.<br>
In the art, wrapping machines are known, for example of the type disclosed in EP-A-529 404 or in UK-A-2 101 958, wherein the cartons of packets are ovefwrapped by feeding each carton, in time with a respective sheet of overwrapping material, to a feeding<br>
station of a wrapping wheel, folding the sheet into a U about the carton, joining two free end portions of the sheet to form a tubular wrapping, and, finally, closing the two ends of the tubular wrapping. The free end portions may be joined in two ways corresponding to two different formats, i.e. along a small lateral surface or a large lateral surface of the carton, and, not being retoolable to produce both formats, the wrapping machine must be changed to switch from one format to the other.<br>
The above method involves both economic and organization drawbacks by requiring the installation of two wrapping machines, one for each format, for each production line to produce both formats and to switch rapidly from one format to the other.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a product wrapping method designed to eliminate the aforementioned drawbacks in a straightforward, low-cost manner.<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a method of wrapping a product, comprising the steps of feeding said product to a loading station of a folding conveyor means; feeding a respective sheet to said loading station in time with said product and in one of two different positions in relation to said product in the loading station; operating said folding conveyor means to advance the product and the relevant wrapping sheet along a folding path extending through first and second wrapping means; and operating one or<br>
the other of said wrapping means to fold said wrapping sheet into a tube about said product; the choice of one or the other of said wrapping means depending on which of said two positions is occupied by the wrapping sheet in said loading station.<br>
The present invention also relates to a machine for wrapping products.<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a machine for wrapping a product, comprising a folding conveyor means to advance the product and a  wrapping sheet along a folding path; first and second selectively activable wrapping means arranged along said folding path and each adapted to fold said wrapping sheet into a tube about said product; a loading station arranged at a beginning of said folding path; first conveying means for feeding said product to said loading station; second conveying means for feeding said sheet to said loading station in time with said product and in one of two different positions in relation to said product in the loading station; controlling means for operating one of said wrapping means to fold said wrapping sheet into a tube about said product; said one wrapping means being chosen, in use, depending on which of said two positions is occupied by the wrapping sheet in said loading station.<br>
The invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a side view, with parts in section and parts removed for clarity, of an input portion of a wrapping machine in accordance with the present invention;<br>
Figure 2 shows a side view, with parts in section and parts removed for clarity, of an output portion of the Figure 1 machine;<br>
Figure 3 shows a view in perspective, with parts in section and parts removed for clarity, of a product formed by the Figure 1 input portion;<br>
Figure 4 shows a view in perspective of the Figure 3 product wrapped in a tubular wrapping formed by the output portion in Figure 2 ;<br>
Figure 5 shows a side view, with parts in section and parts removed for clarity, of the Figure 2 output portion in an alternative operating configuration to that in Figure 2;<br>

More specifically, portion 3 defines along path P an initial path PI extending from an input station SI, where groups 4 and respective sheets 5 are supplied, to a transfer station S2 where cartons 6 are transferred to portion 7; and portion 7 defines along path P an intermediate path P2 extending from a loading station S3, adjacent to station S2 and where cartons 6 intercept respective sheets 8, to a second transfer station S5 where cartons 9 are fed to output portion 10.<br>
Input portion 3 comprises a tubular prefolding spindle 11, which is located at station SI, is defined externally by two large lateral surfaces 12 sloping towards each other and towards a front output surface 13 of spindle 11, and in turn comprises a substantially rectangular-section inner channel 14 defined longitudinally along path PI by surface 13 and by a rear input surface 15 parallel to surface 13 and separated from surface 13 by a distance substantially equal to the length of packets 2. Portion 3 also comprises a supply device 16 in turn comprising a pair of known rollers 17 for feeding each sheet 5 in front of surface 13 of spindle 11; and a push element 18 for feeding each group 4 of packets 2 inside channel 14 in time with respective sheet 5, and with packets 2 arranged side by side in two<br>
superimposed layers.<br>
Portion 3 also comprises a prefolding device 19 located substantially at spindle 11, and for prefolding each sheet 5 over spindle 11; and a conveying unit 20 for feeding each group 4 and respective sheet 5 along path P1, and in turn comprising an extracting element 21 for extracting each group 4 from spindle 11 and feeding group 4 inside a further channel 22 aligned with channel 14 and defined by two parallel walls 23 on either side of path PI. Portion 3 also comprises a pocket conveyor 24 defined by a wheel rotating in steps about an axis Al crosswise to the traveling direction Dl of groups 4, and in turn comprising at least two U-shaped peripheral pockets or seats 25 movable back and forth between a loading position, in which each pocket 25 faces and is aligned with the output of channel 22, and an unloading position, in which each pocket 25 faces an opening 26 in a known supply plate 27 for supplying sheets 8 and extending crosswise to direction Dl between stations S2 and S3.<br>
Conveying unit 20 also comprises a push arm 28, which is of a width substantially equal to the width of channel 22, is mounted substantially crosswise to path PI so as to rotate eccentrically about an axis (not shown) parallel to axis Al, and in turn comprises a shaped end 29 which is inserted inside channel 22 through an opening formed in bottom wall 23 to push each group 4 and respective sheet 5 along channel 22 and into<br>
a pocket 25 in the loading position. Conveying unit 20 also comprises a known push element 28a movable back and forth along path PI to engage a pocket 25 arrested in station S2, unload respective carton 6 from pocket 25, and feed carton 6 through opening 26 and along an initial portion of path P2.<br>
Portion 3 also comprises a folding unit 30 for folding each sheet 5 about respective group 4, and in turn comprising, in addition to prefolding device 19 and shaped end 29, two L-shaped folding elements 31 (only one shown) fitted to a pin 32 parallel to axis Al, and extending from pin 32 alongside channel 22; a further folding element 33 fitted in rotary manner to top wall 23 to engage channel 22 at the passage of each group 4; and, alongside each pocket 25, two helical folding plates 34 fitted to conveyor 24.<br>
More specifically, device 19 comprises two swing plates 35 mounted for rotation about respective pins 36 on either side of path PI; and two rollers 37 fitted to the free ends of plates 35. Pins 36 are powered to swing plates 35 and respective rollers 37 between a rest position (shown by the dash line in Figure 1) in which plates 35 are aligned vertically with each other to define a feed surface 38 for sheets 5 crosswise to path PI, and a prefolding position in which plates 35 are inclined with respect to path PI, and respective rollers 37 are positioned on sheet 5 and substantially on surfaces 12 of spindle 11 to prefold sheet 5<br>
substantially into a U about two respective known preformed bend lines (not shown). Pins 36 are also slidable to and from each other to increase or reduce their center distance and so roll respective rollers 37 along surfaces 12 and also permit a change in the format of groups 4.<br>
Intermediate portion 7 comprises a supply device 39 for supplying sheets 8, and which is timed with conveyor 24 and with push element 28a, and in turn comprises plate 27 and two known rollers 40 for feeding sheets 8 along the surface 41 of plate 27 on the opposite side to conveyor 24; a further tubular prefolding spindle 42 located along path P2, downstream from plate 27, and in turn comprising an inner channel 43 aligned with opening 26 and for the passage of cartons 6 fed forward by element 28a together with respective sheets 8; a further pocket conveyor 44 defined by a wheel rotating in steps about an axis A2 parallel to axis Al, and in turn comprising at least two U-shaped peripheral pockets or seats 45 movable back and forth between a loading position, in which each pocket 45 faces and is aligned with the output of channel 43, and an unloading position, in which each pocket 45 faces an input opening 46 of a further channel 47 for feeding cartons 6 and extending towards station S5 from an unloading station S4 defined by opening 46; and two wrapping devices 48 and 49 located substantially at stations S3 and S4, and which may be activated<br>
selectively to wrap a respective sheet 8, and so form a tubular wrapping 50 (Figures 4 and 6), about each carton 6.<br>
More specifically, channel 43 of spindle 42 comprises two rounded long input edges 51 for prefolding into a U each sheet 8 engaged by respective carton 6 traveling through opening 26; and two wedges 52 located on either side of path P2 and extending inside channel 43 to engage each sheet 8 on either side of respective carton 6 and prevent sheet 8 from sliding with respect to carton 6 as it is prefolded. Each pocket 45 is, as stated, U-shaped, and comprises two parallel large lateral walls 53, which act as folding plates for finally folding each sheet 8 into a U about carton 6 as sheet 8 and carton 6 are inserted inside pocket 45, and the respective free edges 54 of which define a peripheral opening 55 for the insertion of cartons 6 inside pocket 45. Each pocket 45 also comprises two folding plates 56 (only one shown) located substantially on either side of opening 55; and a known push element 57 for unloading pocket 45 at station S4.<br>
Folding device 48 comprises two folding plates 58 and 59 located on either side of station S3 and for engaging opening 55 of a pocket 45 arrested in station S3 with opening 55 crosswise to direction Dl; and two actuators 60 and 61 for activating plates 58 and 59. More specifically, plate 58 is defined by a flat plate, and is moved, crosswise to direction Dl by respective<br>
actuator 60, between a rest position (Figures 2a and 2c), and a folding position (Figure 2c) partially closing opening 55; and plate 59 is defined by a substantially cylindrical plate, and is rotated, about axis A2 by respective actuator 61, between a rest position (Figures 2a and 2b) defining an end portion of a cylindrical wall 62 coaxial with axis A2 along the periphery of conveyor 44 between stations S3 and S4, and a folding position (Figure 2c) partially closing opening 55 of a pocket 45. Actuator 61 comprises a powered shaft 63 coaxial with axis A2; and an arm 64 fitted to shaft 63 and supporting plate 59 and a sealing head 65 extending towards axis A2 through a slot formed in plate 59.<br>
Wrapping device 49 comprises, in addition to wall 62, a wall 66 extending along path P2 to define the bottom wall of channel 47, and having an input edge 66a facing conveyor 44 and acting as a fixed folding element; a retaining device 67 located at the opposite end of wall 62 to plate 59; and a further sealing head 68 fitted beneath wall 66, rotating about an axis A3 parallel to axis A2, and which is inserted inside channel 47 through an opening 69 formed crosswise to direction Dl through wall 66. More specifically, retaining device 67 comprises a tubular cylinder 70 rotating idly on a shaft 71 parallel to axis A2; and a pneumatic distributor 72 having a suction conduit 73 formed along shaft 71, and a longitudinal groove 74<br>
formed along the outer surface of shaft 71, on the side of shaft 71 substantially facing wall 62, to connect conduit 73 to some of a number of radial holes 75 formed through cylinder 70.<br>
Intermediate portion 7 also comprises a wall 76 parallel to wall 66 and defining the top wall of channel 47; two pairs of known helical folding devices in series along the sides of channel 47; and a supply head 79 located at station S5 and moved crosswise to direction Dl by a respective linear actuator 80 to feed cartons 9 to portion 10.<br>
Output portion 10 defines an output path P3 along path P, and comprises a conveyor 81 for feeding cartons 9 in a direction D2 crosswise to direction Dl, and which is defined by two belt conveyors 83 on either side of path P3, and by two plates 82 located on either side of path P3 at station S5 and extending from and crosswise to top wall 76 of channel 47. More specifically, the plate 82 furthest away from wall 76 in direction Dl defines, with a further inclined plate 84 extending from the opposite side of channel 47 to plate 82 and from the level of wall 66, an opening 85 by which to reject any cartons 9.<br>
Operation of machine 1 will now be described with reference to one group 4 of packets 2, and as of the instant in which group 4 has been fed into spindle 11, and respective sheet 5 has been fed by device 16 in front of front surface 13 of spindle 11 and onto the<br>
surface 38 defined by plates 35 in the rest position. More specifically, each sheet 5 is positioned in front of spindle 11 with a small longitudinal panel 86 of the sheet over the output opening of channel 14, and with two large longitudinal panels 87, connected to panel 86 along respective known preformed bend lines, contacting plates 35.<br>
As of the above instant, plates 35 are swung about respective pins 36 so that respective rollers 37 roll along panels 87 to substantially prefold sheet 5 into a U and roll panels 87 onto surfaces 12 of spindle 11. Once sheet 5 is prefolded, plates 35 and extracting element 21 are activated substantially simultaneously, so that group 4, as it travels along path PI, engages panel 86 to gradually remove sheet 5 from spindle 11, while plates 35, as they swing back into the rest position, accompany sheet 5 towards channel 22 and finally fold sheet 5 into a U by means of rollers 37. Between channel 14 and channel 22, two tabs 88, extending from opposite sides of panel 86 and connected to panel 86 by respective preformed bend lines, are folded squarely onto packets 2 by respective elbows 89 of folding elements 31; and, as extracting element 21 withdraws to release group 4, shaped end 29 is inserted inside channel 22, behind group 4, to engage and squarely fold a further small longitudinal panel 90 connected to bottom panel 87 and identical with panel 86. As panel 90 is being folded, and before it actually<br>
contacts group 4, folding element 33 engages a longitudinal tongue 91 connected to top panel 87, and folds tongue 91 squarely between group 4 and panel 90. At this point, it should be pointed out that each sheet 5 is fed in front of spindle 11 so that panel 87 comprising tongue 91, and therefore defining the lid of carton 6, is positioned above spindle 11, and carton 6 is inserted inside pocket 25 with said lid facing upwards.<br>
At this point, folding elements 31 are rotated (anticlockwise in Figure 1) about pin 32 to engage and squarely fold onto group 4 a further two tabs 92 extending from opposite sides of panel 90 and connected to panel 90 along respective preformed bend lines; and, once tabs 92 are folded, shaped end 29, before withdrawing into its original position, is moved forward along a final portion of its travel to insert group 4 and the partially folded sheet 5 inside a pocket 25 in the loading position. As group 4 is inserted inside pocket 25, a further two panels 93, extending from opposite sides of panel 87 and connected to panel 87 along respective preformed bend lines, are folded square by plates 34 of pocket 25 onto tabs 88 and 92 (gummed beforehand in known manner) to form a carton 6 comprising two small lateral walls 86p, 90p defined respectively by panels 86, 90, two large lateral walls 87p defined by panels 87, and two end walls 93p defined externally by panels 93. More specifically, when carton<br>
6 is fully inserted inside pocket 25 in the loading position at station S1, said lid is defined by the upward-facing wall 87p, while the downward-facing wall 87p defines the bottom wall of carton 6.<br>
Once carton 6 is fed into pocket 25, conveyor 24 is activated to rotate pocket 25 about axis Al and transfer carton 6 from station SI to station S2, where carton 6 is extracted from pocket 25 by push element 28a and fed from path PI to path P2 through opening 26 in plate 27, onto the surface 41 of which a sheet 8 has by this time been fed by device 39. More specifically, and as shown in Figures 2a, 2b, 2c, sheet 8 is fed onto surface 41 with an intermediate portion 95 closing opening 26, and with two lateral portions 96 of equal length on opposite sides of opening 26.<br>
As element 28a feeds carton 6 through opening 26 and spindle 42, wall 86p of carton 6 engages and pushes intermediate portion 95 of sheet 8 towards channel 43, and lateral portions 96 are gradually detached from plate 27 and, sliding over input edges 51 of channel 43, are gradually folded onto walls 87p, so as to fold sheet 8 into a U about carton 6. Element 28a feeds carton 6 along path P2 until carton 6 and sheet 8 are inserted inside a pocket 45 at station S3 with sheet 8 folded completely into a U and with an end portion 97 of each portion 96 projecting from wall 90p and outwards of pocket 45 through peripheral opening 55; and, as carton 6 is inserted inside pocket 45, portions 98 of sheet 8<br>
projecting from end walls 93p of carton 6 are folded squarely onto walls 93p by plates 56.<br>
At this point, actuator 60 moves folding plate 58 towards opening 55 to fold the relative end portion 97 -indicated 97a - squarely onto a small lateral surface 90s of carton 6 defined by wall 90p; and, when plate 58 is restored to the rest position, actuator 61 rotates arm 64 about axis A2 to move folding plate 59 towards opening 55 (Figure 2c) and fold the relative end portion 97 - indicated 97b - squarely onto surface 90s and on top of end portion 97a to form the tubular wrapping 50 in Figure 4. Once the two end portions 97 have been folded one on top of the other, conveyor 44 rotates pocket 45 (clockwise about axis A2 in Figure 2) from station S3 to station S4, and, over a first portion of the rotation of conveyor 44 corresponding with the rotation of arm 64 about axis A2, sealing head 65 is activated to seal end portions 97 to each other.<br>
As pocket 45 is arrested at station S4, push element 57 unloads pocket 45 and feeds carton 6 into channel 47 and between two plates 99 (only one shown) similar to plates 56 and located on either side of channel 47 to fold respective portions 100 of sheet 8, similar to portions 98 and projecting from walls 93p. From this point on, carton 6 is fed along channel 47 and sheet 8 is folded by helical folding devices 77 and 78 as further cartons 6 are fed into channel 47, each of which pushes forward the cartons 6 already inside the<br>
channel to feed sealed cartons 9 to station S5, in that channel 47 not only provides for finish folding the open ends 50a of wrapping 50 about carton 6, but also for sealing ends 50a in known manner (not shown) . More specifically, each carton 9 is fed to station S5 with respective carton 6 positioned with the lid-defining wall 87p facing the two belt conveyors 83, and with the bottom-wall-defining wall 87p facing supply head 79, which therefore acts on the bottom wall of carton 6 to feed carton 9 towards conveyors 83.<br>
In Figures 5 and 6, as opposed to being superimposed and sealed on small lateral surface 90s of carton 6 by activating wrapping device 48, end portions 97 are superimposed and sealed on a large lateral surface 87s of carton 6, defined by wall 87p and crosswise to surface 90s. More specifically, each sheet 8 is positioned on plate 27 with intermediate portion 95 to one side of opening 26 in plate 27, so that, as opposed to engaging the center of sheet 8, wall 86p of carton 6 fed through opening 26 engages one of the two lateral portions 96.<br>
When carton 6 is inserted inside pocket 45, therefore, sheet 8 is still folded into a U, but with the difference that end portion 97a is folded immediately onto surface 87s, while a lateral portion 94 of sheet 8, defined by end portion 97b and by part of the relative lateral portion 96, is left projecting outwards of pocket 45 through opening 55. When conveyor<br>
44 is rotated about axis A2 (clockwise in Figure 5) , portion 94 outside pocket 45 collides with plate 59 stationary in the rest position - in which plate 59 defines an end portion of wall 62 and therefore forms part of wrapping device 49 - and is substantially prefolded onto surface 90s, leaving at least end portion 97b projecting with respect to surface 87s.<br>
As pocket 45 approaches station S4, retaining device 67 is activated to draw portion 94 by suction onto tubular cylinder 70 as portion 94 is released from wall 62, so that portion 94 remains attached to device 67 when pocket 45 is arrested in station S4, and device 67 draws sheet 8 tightly about carton 6 as push element 57, simultaneously gripping sheet 8 on wall 90p, begins unloading pocket 45. More specifically, as carton 6 and sheet 8 are extracted simultaneously from pocket 45 and portion 94 of sheet 8 contacts cylinder 70, cylinder 70 is rotated about shaft 71 as long as portion 94 is retained by suction on cylinder 70, i.e. as long as holes 75 are located over groove 74 and therefore communicate with suction conduit 73.<br>
As end portion 97b reaches cylinder 70 and slides past the surface portion of cylinder 70 affected by groove 74, sheet 8 is released completely by device 67 and folded onto surface 87s. That is, as carton 6 is inserted inside channel 47 by element 57, portion 94 is released gradually by device 67, is folded towards surface 87s by edge 66a, and is folded squarely onto<br>
surface 87s as this is gradually exposed as carton 6 is expelled from pocket 45.
