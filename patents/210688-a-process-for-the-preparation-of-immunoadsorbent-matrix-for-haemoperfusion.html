FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of immunoadsorbent matrix based on modified polyvinyl alcohol micro spheres and its use in columns for direct haemo-perfusion.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Plasma exchange has become the most common<br>
and   effective   therapeutic   treatment  of   various intractable  disorders   and  neurological   diseases.<br>
Unavailability  and high price of plasma  products,  and risk  of  infections lead to the development  of  plasma<br>
treatment  devices.   Selective  adsorption   plasma treatment  is now a well established  clinical  practice<br>
for  the treatment of myasthenia gravis   Quillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), systemic lupus erythematosus (8LE) etc.,<br>
but  is  only marginally cheaper  than  plasma exchange procedure,   and  the columns are meant  for  plasma<br>
perfusion  only.   However,  this can  eliminate   the dependence of plasma products on plasmapheresis thereby<br>
avoiding    risk   of   infections-    Though   various immunoabsorbtion  columns for plasma perfusion only sirs<br>
available,  it  is stil1  not  known  to  have  direct haemoperfusion  columns.  Further, it is not  known  to<br>
have devices that can simplify and reduce treatment cost further  by  achieving  plasma separation  and   plasma<br>
treatment in a single device or direct haemo-perfusion-<br><br>
An  apparatus and method is known in the art which draws blood through a blood pump and a column^ and functions as a plasma separator to cause a separation of the blood cells from the plasma.  The plasma  is  then passed  through an immunoadsorbent column so that  IgG proteins get adsorbed in the adsorbent, and the  treated plasma  is then mixed with the removed blood  cells and returned  to  the patient.  The disadvantage of  such a method  and  apparatus  is that  of  substantial  costs. Further,  such a method is to be repeated once or  twice and  each time the column and plasma separator is to  be replaced.<br>
Yet another method and apparatus known in the art is to withdraw the blood of a patient, which is then centrifuged to remove the plasma, which is then replaced by fresh blood plasma from a donor. A disadvantage of such a method and apparatus is that of infection in the fresh blood of a donor. Further, hemolysis can occur in the centrifuge. OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
An  object of this invention is to propose  a process for the preparation of an immunoadsorbent matrix based on polyvinyl alcohol microphones for direct haemo-perfusion.<br><br>
A further object of this invention is to propose a  process  for the preparation  of  an  immunoadsorbent matrix based on polyvinyl alcohol which can specifically remove  IgG  proteins  from blood and  is  highly  blood compatible.<br>
A  still further object of this invention is top propose  an  immunoadsorbent column  based  on   the immunoadsorbent matrix  for  the specific  removal  of antibodies belonging to or consisting of immunoglobulin of the class B  and circulating immune complexes.<br>
Yet  another object of this invention  is  to propose an immunoadsorbent column which can be used  for direct   perfusion  of  human  patient blood  for   the treatment of Its mediated disorders.<br>
Another  object  of  this  invention  is   to propose  an immunoadsorbent column for blood   perfusion which may be applied clinically as a less complex  and inexpensive alternative to plasma treatment devices.<br>
Further  objects  and  advantages of   this invention  wi11  be more  apparent  from  the  ensuing description.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
According  to  this invention there is  provided  a process for the preparation of an immunoadsorbent matrix comprising in the steps offs<br><br>
a)	preparing   polyvinyl  alcohol   beads   by<br>
partially  cross linking polyvinyl alcohol with a  cross linking agent;<br>
b)	coupling  phenylalanine onto  the  polyvinyl<br>
alcohol   beads  to obtain a COOH functionality of  the<br>
phenylalanine polyvinyl alcohol beads;<br>
c)	activating said COOH functionality for<br>
immobilizing heparin onto said phenylalanine coupled<br>
beads.<br>
In   accordance with  this   invention   the preparation  of  immunoadsorbent beads comprises  in preparing partially crosslinked polyvinyl alcohol  (PVA) beads  by mixing  an  aqueous solution  of  PVA  with glutaraldehyde and  dispersing the mixture  in  an  oil medium  by stirring.  To the dispersed PVA solution  is added  benzoyl chloride slowly dropwise.  On  completion of reaction9 the beads thus formed are subjected to  the step of filtering, washing, drying and sieving to obtain the crosslinked PVA beads.  The dry crosslinked  beads &amp;re  subjected to swelling in an alkaline medium followed by   filtering   and   then   adding   a  mixture   of epichlorohydrin and lp4-dioxan to the swollen beads and the  reaction  is performed by  heating•   The reaction mixture  is cooled  and then followed  by  washing  and<br><br>
subjecting the washed beads to treatment with aminoacid<br>
solution with gentle stirring, and washing the beads  to<br>
obtain  aminoacids  coupled PVA beads.   The ammonia  acid<br>
coupled beads is activated by exposing them to  1-ethyl-<br>
3-(3"dimethyl amino propyl) carbodiimide in PBS  followed<br>
by  the step of exposing the activated beads to heparin<br>
solution,  washing to remove unbound heparin, to obtain<br>
the immunoadsorbent beads, Hep-ph-PVA-<br>
The first step of the process consists  in preparation of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) beads.  For  this purpose, partially crosslinked PVA beads Sire  prepared by acid catalysed reaction by mixing an aqueous solution of PVA of  molecular weight 1,00,000 to 1,50,000  in 3 to 6  ml of  glutaraldehyde and dispersed in an oil  medium and  subjected  to  the step of  stirring.   Upon  PVA solution being completely dispersed, a catalyst is added dropwise.   The catalyst  by way of example, is  benzoyl chloride.  After completion of the reaction in a  period of approximately 30 mins, the beads sure  filtered, washed, dried and classified.<br>
The oil medium used in the cross linking  of PVA  beads is heavy and light liquid paraffin oil  in  a proportion  for example 2:1, with  sorbitan  monooleate added  thereto.  Preferably, approximately 500 ml.  oil solution contains about 355 ml. of heavy oil and 165 ml. of light oil with 0-4 ml. of sorbitan monooleate.<br><br>
The washing  of  the  beads  is  done using<br>
organic solvents preferably petroleum ether followed  by<br>
acetone and subsequently with distilled water <br>
The next step in the process comprises  in<br>
phenylalanine coupling onto the PVA micro spheres  is<br>
achieved  according  to the reaction scheme  (Scheme  I)<br>
shown in Fig. 1 of the accompanying drawing.<br>
Stable aminoacid ligands are coupled onto the<br>
beads  by  swelling.  Known amounts of  dry  beads  were<br>
swollen  in an alkaline medium and  filtered.  A mixture<br>
of  epichlorohydrin  and organic solvent  such as  1,4-<br>
dioxin was added into the swollen beads and the reaction<br>
o was performed at 100-120 C for one hour.  The mixture is<br>
cooled to room temperature^ followed by through washing with acetone and distilled water to remove  the excess<br>
reaction   mixture and  finally  to neutrality.    The<br>
phenylalanine  is coupled  to the  activated  beads  by<br>
treating them with 250 mg% and above aminoacid  solution<br>
o at 40-60 C with gentle stirring.  The beads were washed<br>
free of uncoupled aminoacid.  The possible reaction  is depicted in Fig. 1.<br>
The  beads are washed free of  the uncoupled<br>
amino acid by acetone and distilled water and finally to neutrality.<br><br>
Immobilization   of  heparin   onto   the phenylalanine coupled beads is completed  according  to the  reaction scheme (Scheme II) as shown in Fig.  2 of the accompanying drawings.<br>
The aminoacid coupled PVA beads (wet) are exposed to l-ethyl-3"(3"dimethyl iminopropyl) carbodiimide in PBS. The activated beads are washed with distilled water followed by exposure to 4-25 mX heparin solution in PBS to obtain adsorbents with different amount of bound heparin. The Hep-ph-PVA beads   then washed with distilled water to remove unbound heparin.<br>
The  two reactions ore  carried out at room temperature with gentle stirring at a pH of about 8.5 and 5.5 respectively.<br>
In accordance with another embodiment of  the present  invention, a column is packed with the Hep-ph-PVA  beads and used in haemo-perfusion for the specific removal  of  antibodies  that belong to or consist of immunoglobulin of G, i.e. antibodies such as anti-Dap Ahab, anti-GBM and circulating immune complexes.<br>
Other  objects and advantages of the  present invention   will  be apparent  from  the  accompanying examples and  the comparative study  depicted  in  the following tables.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
