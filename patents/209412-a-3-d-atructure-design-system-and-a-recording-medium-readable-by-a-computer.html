				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a  3-D structure design system for designing a concrete-made structure comprising a floor a wall and a ceiling,  and a recording medium which is readable by a Computer     More particularly, the invention relates to a 3-D structure design system or the like which remarkably shortens the structure period of design and which allows the accurate design drawings and the quantity of the structure to be obtained by designing the concrete-made 3-D structure grasped as a cubic object from the very beginning and associating quantities calculation. 2. Description of the Prior Art<br>
Conventionally, in the design of a concrete-made 3-D structure, a designer inputs a basic design drawing into a two dimension CAD system upon the request of a structure client and prepares detailed design drawings on the structure with a request of the structure client applied through two-dimension CAD system and manual work, and each kind of quantities calculation is read and oreuared from the drawings which have been prepared.    Furthermore in the case where the design is to be changed, after<br><br><br>
the information on the ground surface which has been prepared with the 2-D CAD system is changed, each kind of quantities calculation is performed again.    Consequently, the drawing prepared by the 2-D CAD system is produced, and mathematical values are read with a man's eyes and transcribed on a separate sheet of paper so that the summing-up calculation is performed.<br>
However, according to such a method, there arises a case in which the digital data of the 2-D CAD drawings are not reflected upon the quantities calculation and mathematical values indicated in the CAD drawings are not the same with the quantities calculation.    In many cases, inaccurate quantities calculation forms are prepared with the result that there arises a problem that a considerable time is required for checking the values and correcting wrong values.    In particular, in the case where a change is made in the design through a consultation with the structure client, there arises a case in which a large-scale correction work is required such as the correction of the CAD drawings, and the re-calculation of quantity values.    This will lead to an increase in the design cost, a delay in the design period, and dissatisfaction with the result of the quantities calculation and as a result, confidence from the client will be lost. Furthermore, considerable experience and expertise are required for the check of the normal structure design.    There is also a problem that a lot of time and labor are required to prepare products free from errors to be delivered to clients.<br>

A 3-D structure design system according to the present invention and a method therefor will be explained on the basis of the drawings hereinafter.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, the 3-D structure design system basically comprises a processing unit (computer) 1 attached with a central processing unit, and memories such as a RAM (Random Access Memory) constituting an internal memory and a ROM (Read Only Memory), an additional disk 2 comprising a hard disk, a photo-electro-magnetic disk or the like, an input device 3 comprising a keyboard or the like, a display device 4 such as a color display device or the like comprising a CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) and an LCD (Liquid Crystal Display), and an output device 5 comprising a printer, a plotter or the like.<br>
The above additional disk 2 memorizes each kind of program and<br><br>
each kind of data required for processing each program, the program allowing the processing unit 1 to serve as data input means, 3-D .structural data search means, body quantities search means, earth-work drawing input means, earth-work quantities search means, reinforcement data input means, reinforcement quantities search means and search result display means or the like.<br>
For example, as a program which allows the processing unit 1 to serve as a 3-D structural data designing means, a program of the 3-D structural data search means is memorized for not only searching the 3-D data of the structure and recognizing connection data between blocks, but also automatically judging an interfered portion of blocks through the result of rivaling between blocks, and adjusting the length and the width of the members.<br>
Besides, as a program which allows the processing unit 1 to serve as a 3-D structure data recognition means, a program of the body quantities search means is memorized for determining specifications peculiar to all the concrete structures searched by the program, a volume and a surface area of each member and a volume of a space partitioned with the members on the basis of other members data.<br>
Furthermore, the above additional disk 2 memorizes a structure of the whole concrete-made structure and the result of the members quantities calculation, and such each kind of program and data are recorded on a recording medium such as  for example. a FD (Floppy Disk), a CD-ROM "(Compact Disk Head Only Memory) or the like, so that the program and the data are read into the additional disk 2 via a leading device.    Furthermore.<br><br>
the program and the data can be memorized in the additional disk 2 by directly inputting the program and data from the above input device 3.<br>
Then, the processing unit 1 has a function of analyzing the structural data of the concrete-made structure on the basis of the program and data memorized in the additional disk 2, automatically calculating each of the quantities of concrete, forms and timbering, and obtaining the result conforming to the quantities on the design drawings.<br>
Furthermore, the processing unit 1 has a function of recognizing the size of each member and the relationship between members on the basis of each data of the concrete-made structure input via the input device 3, and searching the constituent elements of the whole concrete-made structure, and a contact surface between members.    Specifically, the processing unit 1 recognizes the coordinates of each member of the concrete-made structure, and searches an area of a portion that contacts other members.<br>
Furthermore, the processing unit 1 has earth-work drawing input means for inputting ground quality data, the relationship between the concrete-made structure and a ground level, and earth-work data such as inclination of a drilled surface as well as earth-work quantities search means for searching the quantity of drilled ground on the basis of input earth-work data, and searching the volume quantity which is buried underground in the structure from data on the above concrete-made structure and data on the ground level.    Here, the searched quantity of ground is handled as the quantity of residual ground, and the processing-unit 1 also has a function of determining the quantity of the buried ground.<br>
Furthermore, the processing unit 1 has reinforcement data input<br>
8<br><br>
means for inputting required reinforcement, data peculiar to each member of the concrete-made structure via the input device 3 and the reinforcement quantities search means for searching the length, the shape, the number and the weight of the reinforcement on the basis of the input reinforcement data.    Furthermore, tKe processing unit 1 has a function of displaying on and outputting on the display device 4 a 3-D model drawing of the concrete-made structure.    Furthermore, the i-eading device has a function of reading a program memorized in recording mediums such as a FD, a CD-ROM or the like into the additional disk 2 via the processing unit 1 on the basis of the program for reading which the program is memorized in the additional disk 2.<br>
The recording medium according to the present invention is a recording medium such as a FD, a CD-ROM or the like in which a program is recorded for allowing the 3-D structure design system (a computer) to serve as the above data input means, the 3-D structural data search means, body quantities search means, earth-work drawing input means, earth-work quantities search means, reinforcement data input means, reinforcement quantity search means including the preparation of the design drawing, and result display means for displaying the result thereof.<br>
Hereinbelow, there will be explained one preferred embodiment of a method for searching the quantity of the concrete-made structure, and for searching the earth-work and reinforcement processing with the 3-D structure design system.<br>
Fig. 3 is a flowchart showing a main flow of a design of the concrete-made structure by the 3-D structure design system.<br><br>
In the 3-D structure design system according to the embodiment, the members data of the concrete-made structure is input in the beginning (step A), the 3-D model in the concrete-made structure is searched on the basis of data on the input concrete-made structure (step B), and the quantities of the 3-D model of the searched concrete-made structure is searched on the basis of the size of each member of the 3-D model thereof and the connection data between the members (step C).<br>
Subsequently, the earth-work quantities are searched by inputting the earth-work drawings on the basis of the S-D model of the concrete-made structure (step D). and furthermore, an arbitrary sectional drawing is prepared on the basis of the 3-D model of the concrete-made structure (step E).    Furthermore, the diameter and the number of required reinforcements peculiar to each member are input on the basis of the 3-D model of the concrete-made structure and the reinforcement processing and the quantity of the reinforcement are searched (step F) to display the design data of the concrete-made structure as a result.<br>
The data of the concrete-made structure is input (step A) by displaying an instruction for requesting, for example, the input of the whole body, and operating the input device in accordance with the instruction.    As data of the concrete-made structure, on the basis of the size of the bottom slab member, data on the size and the position of the wall and an opening of the slab is input in addition to the size of the column, the wall, the beam, the slab and the hunch for each of the steps.<br>
Thus, upon the input of the data on the concrete-made structure, the 3-D model of the concrete-made structure is prepared based on the data (step<br>
10<br><br>
B).    Furthermore, the members data and the connection data of the concrete-made structure are searched, and each of the quantities of the concrete, forms and timbering for each member is searched (step C). The input data of the structure are specifically classified into elements shown in Fig. 4.    Line segments, circles, and polygons serve as a simple element.    This is the smallest unit of elements.    The collection of a plurality of these simple elements corresponds to a compound element.    For example, when a rectangular parallelopiped is input, the upper surface, a rectangle of the bottom surface and a collection of the line segments connecting each of the apexes thereof form a compound element which is referred to as a solid element. As a basic shape, modeling is executed by the input of four kinds of basic shapes such as 1) a rectangular parallelopiped, 2) a column, 3) a cylinder and 4) a trigonal prism.    The kind of members and the generation tree are shown in Fig. 6.    Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 7, upon the completion of the input of the data (step A), adjacent members are searched (step A2), so that the search member is obtained (step A3).    On the basis of the acquisition of data on the members, respective members are rivaled each other (step A4), the shapes of the negative members are changed (step A5), the attribute thereof is set (step A6), and the design file is generated (step A7).    Designing the above members data file is made by preparing the members data (Table 1) including the connection state of each member object.    The content comprises four sections: <basic data>. <members data>, <bevel data>, and <connection data>.    The <members data>, the <bevel data> and the <connection data> form a tree structure.<br>

Table 1<br>
When the design file of the concrete-made structure is prepared, the quantities calculation is determined from the estimating flowchart shown in Fig. 8.    The drilling shape and the drilled quantity are searched when the ground quality, the inclination of the drilled surface, and the ground level (the height of the ground surface) are designated.    Also, volume of a buried, underground portion of concrete-made structure, thereby searching quantity of residual ground and buried ground.     Furthermore, the plane drawing and the sectional drawing are prepared (step E).    When the diameter and tho number of the required reinforcement peculiar to the member are input.<br>
12<br><br>
the shape and the length of the reinforcement are searched after the relationship between    connection data of the members is judged (step F). Fig. 9 is a reinforcement arrangement drawing and a flowchart of the quantities calculation. On the basis of the design file (step Fl) of the concrete-made structure, the reinforcement data for each member is either input or input corrected (step F2).    Then a drawing is prepared in which the reinforcement arrangement and the reinforcement data is described (step F3).    Furthermore, the reinforcement processing table is prepared with the reinforcement data.      Fig. 10, Table 2, Table 3 and Table 4 show a modeling view of the 3-D structure design system and an example of an output form.<br>
