DESCRIPTION NOVEL P0RPHYRA2INE COLORING MATTER, INK, INK SET AND COLORED<br>
ARTICLE Technical Field [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a novel porphyrazine coloring matter, an ink set, a method for Inkjet recording using this ink or this ink set and a colored article.<br>
Background Art [0002]<br>
Recently, materials to form color images have particularly been a mainstream as an image recording material, and specifically recording materials for the Inkjet method thermal transfer type image recording materials, recording materials using an electrophotographic method, transfer type silver halide photosensitive materials, printing inks, recording pens and the like are frequently used. In addition, color filters are used for LCD (liquid crystal display) and PDP (plasma display panel) in displays and for electronic parts such as CCD (charge coupled device) in photographing equipment. These color image recording materials and color filters employ coloring matters (dyes or pigments) of three primary colors for so-called additive color process and subtractive color process in order to reproduce or record full color images, but it is the case that there is no coloring matter which has. absorption characteristics to achieve a preferable color reproduction area and is durable under various use conditions, so their improvement is strongly desired. [0003]<br>
The Inkjet recording method has been rapidly prevailing and further growing because the material cost is inexpensive, rapid recording is possible, noise in recording is less and also color recording is easy. The Inkjet recording method includes the continuous method where ink droplets are continuously flown and the<br><br>
on-demand method where ink droplets are flown responding to an image Information signal, and its discharge method includes a method where ink droplets are discharged by applying a pressure to piezoelectric elements and a method where bubbles are generated in ink by heating to discharge ink droplets, a method using an ultrasonic waves, a method where ink droplets are sucked and discharged by electrostatic force, or the like. Further, examples of ink suitable for Inkjet recording include water-based inks, oil-based inks, solid (hot melt type) inks or the like. [0004]<br>
Requirements on a coloring matter to be used for ink suitable for such Inkjet recording are that it has good solubility or dispersibility in solvent; allows high density recording and has a good hue; is durable against light, heat and active gases (oxidizing gases such as NOx and ozone, and other gases such as SOx) in the environment; has excellent fastness against water and chemicals, good fixation on record-receiving materials, resistance to bleeding, excellent storage stability as an ink and no toxicity; also is inexpensively available, and so on. In particular, a cyan coloring matter is strongly desired which has a good hue of cyan, is excellent in light fastness (durability against light), ozone fastness (durability against ozone gas) and moisture fastness (durability under high humidity), and does not exhibit bronze phenomenon (which is also called bronzing phenomenon). Bronze phenomenon means a glare phenomenon caused by that coloring matter is aggregated on the surface of glossy paper due to association or aggregation of coloring matter or insufficient absorption of ink into medium, and has metallic luster. If this phenomenon occurs, all the aspects such as glossiness, print quality and print density are inferior. [0005]<br>
The typical skeleton for water-soluble cyan coloring matters to be used suitable for Inkjet recording is phthalocyanine or triphenylmethane skeletons. The typical phthalocyanine coloring matter to be most widely reported and utilized includes phthalocyanine derivatives which are classified into the following A to H. [0006]<br><br>
A: known phthalocyanine coloring matters such as Direct Blue 86, Direct Blue 87,<br>
Direct Blue 199, Acid Blue 249 and Reactive Blue 71<br>
[0007]<br>
B: the phthalocyanine coloring matters described in Patent Literatures to 3 and the<br>
like<br>
Cfor example, a mixture of Cu-Pc-(S03Na)m(S02NH2)n : m + n =1 to 4) [0008] C: the phthalocyanine coloring matter described in Patent Literature 4<br>
Cfor example, Cu-Pc-(C02H)m(CONR1R2)n : m + n = a number of 0 to 4) [0009] D: the phthalocyanine coloring matter described in Patent Literature 5<br>
Cfor example, Cu-Pc-(S03H)m(S02NR1R2)n : m + n = a number of 0 to 4, and m * 0 ) [0010] E: the phthalocyanine coloring matter described in Patent Literature 6<br>
Cfor example, Cu-Pc-(S03H)i(S02NH2)m(S02NR1R2)n : I + m + n = a number of 0 to 4)<br>
[0011] F: the phthalocyanine coloring matter described in Patent Literature 7<br>
Cfor example, Cu-Pc-(S02NRiR2)n : n = a number of 1 to 5^ [0012]<br>
G: the phthalocyanine coloring matters described in Patent Literatures 8, 9, 12 and the like<br>
Cphthalocyanine compounds where the substitution position of the substituent is controlled and phthalocyanine coloring matters where a substituent is introduced into the p-position) [0013]<br>
H: benzopyridoporphyrazine coloring matters having a pyridine ring and a benzene ring described in Patent Literatures 0, 13, 14 and the like<br><br>
[0014]<br>
Phthalocyanine coloring matters recently used widely in general which are represented by Direct Blue 86 and Direct Blue 199 have a characteristic that they are excellent in light fastness compared with magenta coloring matters and yellow coloring matters which are known in general. Phthalocyanine coloring matters are not so preferred as a cyan ink because they have a greenish hue under acidic conditions. Therefore, these coloring matters are preferably used under neutral to alkali conditions when used as a cyan ink. However, if a record-receiving material to be used is acidic paper, it is possible that the hue of printed matters change largely even though the ink is neutral to alkali. [0015]<br>
In addition, if a phthalocyanine coloring matter is used a cyan ink, the print density is decreased because the hue of printed matters is changed to a greenish color as well as color fading occurs because of oxidizing gases such as nitrogen oxide gas and ozone which are often raised as an environmental issue in recent years. [0016]<br>
On the other hand, triphenylmethane coloring matters have a good hue, but are very inferior in light fastness, ozone fastness and moisture fastness. [0017]<br>
Hereafter, Inkjet recording will have a larger application field and be also used widely for articles on exhibition in advertisement and the like, resulting that coloring matters and inks to be used there will be more and more strongly required to have a good hue and be inexpensive as well as excellent in light fastness, active gas fastness in the environment and moisture fastness because they are more often exposed to light and active gases (oxidizing gases such as NOx and ozone, and other gases such as SOx). It is, however, difficult to develop a cyan coloring matter (for example, a phthalocyanine coloring matter) and a cyan ink satisfying these requirements at a high level. So far, phthalocyanine coloring matters provided with<br><br>
active gas fastness are disclosed in Patent Literatures 3, 8 to 12 and 14, but any cyan<br>
coloring matter or cyan ink has not yet been achieved which satisfies all such<br>
qualities as hue, light fastness, ozone fastness and moisture fastness, does not<br>
exhibit bronze phenomenon, and can also be inexpensively produced. Therefore, the<br>
market requirements have not yet been sufficiently satisfied.<br>

Effect of the Invention [0031]<br>
An ink using the compound of the present invention is an ink which has a good hue as a cyan ink and is excellent in light fastness, ozone fastness and moisture fastness. In addition, it exhibits no crystal precipitation or no change in physical properties and color after storage for a long period of time, so it has good storage stability. Further, it can show a color tone in a wide visible region when used together with other magenta ink and yellow ink. Therefore, a cyan ink using the porphyrazine coloring matter of the present invention is extremely useful as an ink for inkjet<br><br>
recording.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying out the invention [0032]<br>
The present invention will be specifically explained. The ink suitable for inl<jet recording of tlie present invention is characterized by containing a porphyrazine coloring matter the above formula that it found out where to among benzo rings tetrabenzoporphyrazine usually called phthalocyanine are replaced nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic for use as mother nucleus and an unsubstituted sulfamoyi group certain substituted sulfamoyl introduced very suitable ink inkjet recorded articles with using said have excellent fastness against ozone gas hardly exhibit bronze phenomenon.></jet>
The nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring of A, B, C and/or D in the above formula (1) includes, for example, nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic rings containing 1 to 2 nitrogen atoms such as a pyridine ring, a pyrazine ring, a pyrimidine ring and/or a pyridazine ring. Among them, a pyridine ring or a pyrazine ring is preferable and a pyridine ring is the most preferable. Of A, B, C and D, 1 to 3 are nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic rings and the rest are benzene rings. As the number of nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic rings is increased, ozone fastness is improved but bronzing resistance is apt to occur,.therefore it is advisable that the number of nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic rings is accordingly controlled to select a well balanced ratio in view of ozone fastness and bronzing resistance. The number of nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic rings also varies depending on the kind of heterocycles and could not be definitively suggested, however typically, it is preferably in the range of 1 to 2, more preferably 1.1 to 1.75 and further preferably 1.1 to 1.5, on the average. The rest are benzene rings.<br><br>
When the number of nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic rings is more than 1 and less than 2, it is the average number of heterocycles in a mixture of a compound having 1 heterocycle and a compound having 2 heterocycles.<br>
When the number of heterocycles is 2, it can be considered that any of the compounds is produced where they are side by side (for example, A and B) and where they are opposite (for example, A and C).

2-carboxy-4-sulfamoylanilino, 2,5-dichloro-4-sulfoanilino, 3-phosphonoanilino or the like. Y is preferably a hydroxy group or an amino group and more preferably an amino group.<br>
The preferable compound in the present invention can include a compound where the number of nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic rings is 1 to 2, the nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring is a pyridine ring or a pyrazine ring and more preferably a pyridine ring, the range of b is 0 to 2.9, c is 0.1 to 3, the sum of b and c is 1 to 3 and more preferably 2 to 3, E is C2 to C4 alkylene and more preferably ethylene, X is a sulfo-substituted aniline group, a carboxy-substituted anilino group or a phosphono-substituted anilino group and said substituted anilino group may have 0 to 3 substltuents of one or more kinds selected from the group consisting of a sulfo group, a carboxy group, a phosphono group, a hydroxy group, an alkoxy group, a nitro group and a chlorine atom, and Y is a hydroxy group or an amino group. In addition, a further preferable compound is a compound where X is an anilino group having 1 to 2 sulfo substltuents and more preferably 2 sulfo groups, and Y is an amino group, in the above. Further, as for the range of b and c, b is in the range of 0.5 to 2.5, c is in the range of 0.1 to 1.5, and the sum of b and c is more preferably in the range of 2 to 3, in the above.

Specific examples of A, B, C, D, E, X and Y and the numbers of b and c in the porphyrazine coloring matter represented by the above formula (1) of the present invention are shown in Table 1. The following examples show typical compounds to specifically explain the porphyrazine coloring matter of the present invention and the present invention are not limited thereto. In addition, when the nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring of A, B, C or D is a pyridine ring, positional isomers of the nitrogen atom exist as described aftenward and synthesis for coloring matter gives a mixture of isomers. It is difficult to isolate these isomers and it is also difficult to identify isomers by analysis. Therefore, the mixture is typically used as intact, and these isomers are not distinguished here and shown by one structural formula for convenience as above because no problem is particularly posed in the present invention in spite of a mixture of isomers. [0038] [Table 1]<br><br><br>
[0039]<br>
The porphyrazine coloring matter of the present invention Is typically used alone, however may optionally be used as a mixture with a known cyan coloring matter.<br>
In addition, when the porphyrazine coloring matter of the present invention is used as a cyan coloring matter, it is a preferable aspect that it is used as a mixture of<br><br>
a compound having 1 nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring and a compouna having 2 or 3 nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic rings and more preferably a mixture of a compound having 1 nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring and a compound of 2 nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic rings. As for the ratio of the both in that case, the ratio of the compound having 1 nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring is 10 to 100% (based of mass: hereinafter the same unless otherwise specifically noted) preferably 50 to 95% and more preferably 60 to 93%, and the ratio of the compound having 2 or 3 (preferably two) nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic rings is 0 to 90%, preferably 5 to 50% ,and more preferably 7 to 40%, approximately, relative to the total of the both.<br>
Further, when it is used as a mixture with a known cyan coloring matter, a phthalocyanine-based coloring matter is preferable as a coloring matter to be mixed. The ratio of the porphyrazine coloring matter of the present invention and the other coloring matter to be used as said mixture can be properly determined according to intended use and the like. For example, relative to said mixture, the porphyrazine coloring matter of the present invention is 1 to 100% (based on mass : hereinafter the same), preferably 10 to 95% and more preferably 20 to 90%, and the rest is another coloring matter, for example, a phthalocyanine-based coloring matter.<br>
The method to produce the compound of the formula (1) of the present invention will be explained. [0040]<br>
Firstly, a copper porphyrazine coloring matter represented by the following formula (6) is synthesized.<br><br><br>
(wherein, A, B, C and D have the same meanings as above) [0041]<br>
In order to synthesize the copper porphyrazine coloring matter represented by the above formula (6), a conventional known manner can be applied. For example, It is obtained by reaction of a nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring dicarboxylic acid derivative having aromaticity and a phthalic acid derivative in the presence of catalyst and a copper compound. The number of nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic rings and the number of benzene rings in A, B, C and D can be adjusted by changing the molar ratio in reaction of the nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring dicarboxylic acid derivative and the phthalic acid derivative. For example, when 1 to 3 out of 4 aromatic 6-membered rings of A to D in the present invention are nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic rings and the rest are benzene rings, an intended compound can be obtained by that the nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring dicarboxylic acid derivative and the phthalic acid derivative are respectively used in a use ratio in the range of 0.25 mol to 0.75 mol according to the content ratio so that the total of the both is 1 mol. For example, in the case of 1 nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring and 3 benzene rings, it is advisable the nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring dicarboxylic acid derivative is used in a ratio of 0.25 mol and the phthalic acid derivative is used in a ratio of 0.75 mol.<br>
The nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring dicarboxylic acid derivative includes a 6-membered nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring dicarboxylic acid derivative having carboxy groups or reactive groups derived therefrom at 2 positions side by side (such as an acid amide group, an imide group, an acid anhydride group,<br><br>
a carbonitrile group). Specifically, it includes dicarboxylic acid compounds such as quinolinic acid, 3,4-pyridine dicarboxylic acid and 2,3-pyrazinedicarboxylic acid, acid anhydride compounds such as quinolinic anhydride, 3,4-pyridinedicarboxylic anhydride and 2,3-pyrazinedicarboxylic anhydride, dicarboxamide compounds such as pyridine-2,3-dicarboxamide, dicarboxylic acid monoamide compounds such as pyrazine-2,3-dicarboxylic acid monoamide, acid imide compounds such as quinolinic acid imide, and dicarbonitrile compounds such as pyridine-2,3-dicarbonitrile and pyrazine-2,3-dicarbonitrile.

[0042]<br>
The synthesis method for copper porphyrazine coloring matter typically includes the nitrile method and Wyler method, which require different reaction conditions and the like. The nitrile method is a method for synthesis of a porphyrazine coloring matter using a dicarbonitrile compound such as pyridine-2,3-dicarbonitrile, pyrazine-2,3-dicarbonitrile and phthalonitrile as material. On the other hand, Wyler method utilizes, as material, a dicarboxylic acid compound such as phthalic acid, quinolinic acid, 3,4-pyridine dicarboxylic acid and 2,3-pyrazinedicarboxylic acid, a acid anhydride compound such as phthalic anhydride, quinolinic anhydride, 3,4-pyridinedicarboxylic anhydride and 2,3-pyradinedicarboxylic anhydride, a dicarboxamide compound such as phthalamide, pyridine-2,3-dicarboxamide, a dicarboxylic acid monoamide compound such as phthalamic acid and pyrazine-2,3-dicarboxylic acid monoamide, and acid imide compounds such as phthalimide and quinolinic acid imide. In Wyler method, addition of urea is essential and the use amount of urea is a molar quantity of 5 to 100 time mol relative to 1 mol of the total amount of the nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring dicarboxylic acid derivative and the phthalic acid derivative. [0043]<br>
Usually, the reaction is carried out in the presence of a solvent and the nitrile<br><br>
method utilizes, as a solvent, an organic solvent having a boiling point of 100°C or more, more preferably 130°C or more. The solvent includes, for example, n-amylalcohol, n-hexanol, cyclohexanol, 2-methyl-1-pentanol, 1-heptanol, 1-octanol, 2-ethylhexanol, N,N-dimethylamlnoethanol, benzyl alcohol, ethyleneglycol, propylene glycol, trichlorobenzene, chloronaphthalene, nitrobenzene, quinoline, sulfolane, urea or the like. On the other hand, Wyler method utilizes, as a solvent, an aprotic organic solvent having a boiling point of 150°C or more, more preferably 180°C or more. The solvent includes, for example, trichlorobenzene, chloronaphthalene, nitrobenzene, quinoline, sulfolane, urea or the like. The use amount of solvent is 1 to 100 time mass of the total amount of the nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring dicarboxylic acid derivative and the phthalic acid derivative. [0044]<br>
The catalyst in the nitrile method includes ammonia; a cyclic base such as quinoline or 1,8-diazabicyclo[5,4,0]-7-undecene; amines such as tributylamine and N,N-dimethylaminoethanol; and alkali metal alcoholates such as sodium ethoxide or sodium methoxide. On the other hand, the catalyst in Wyler method includes ammonium molybdate, boric acid and the like. The addition amount is 0.001 to 1 time mo! relative to 1 mol of the total amount of the nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring dicarboxylic acid derivative and the phthalic acid derivative. [0045]<br>
The copper compound includes metal copper or copper compounds such as halide, carboxylate, sulfate, nitrate, acetylacetonate or complexes of copper. The copper compound includes, for example, copper chloride, copper bromide, copper acetate, copper acetylacetonate and the like. The use amount of the copper compound is 0.15 to 0.35 time mol relative to 1 mol of the total amount of the nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring dicarboxylic acid derivative and the phthalic acid derivative. [0046]<br>
The reaction temperature in the nitrile method is usually 100 to 200°C and<br><br>
preferably 130 to 170°C. On the other hand, the reaction temperature in Wyler method is 150 to 300°C and preferably 170 to 220°C. In addition, the reaction time varies depending on the reaction conditions, however usually 1 to 40 hours. After completion of reaction, the copper porphyrazine coloring matter of the above formula (6) is obtained by filtration, washing and drying. [0047]<br>
The present invention will be more specifically explained taking, for an example, the  compound  (copper dibenzobis(2,3-pyrido)porphyrazine)  represented  by the above formula (6) where two of A to D are pyridine rings and the rest two are benzene rings. [0048]<br>
The copper dibenzobis(2,3-pyrido)porphyrazine represented by the above formula (6) where two of A, B, C and D are pyridine rings and the rest two are benzene rings is obtained by reaction of quinolinic acid (0.5 mol), a phthalic anhydride (0.5 mol), a copper (II) chloride (0.25 mol), ammonium phosphomolybdate (0.004 mol) and urea (6 mol) in a sulfolane solvent at 200'C for 5 hours. The reactivity varies depending on the kind or the use amount of quinolinic acid, phthalic anhydride, metal compound, solvent, catalyst and the like, not limited to the above. [0049]<br>
In addition, when synthesis is carried out by the above methods, the main ingredient is copper dibenzobis(2,3-pyrido)porphyrazine, and five kinds of isomers where the position of the pyridine ring and the position of the pyridine ring-nitrogen atom {the formulas (7-A) to (7-E)} are different are produced. At the same time, copper tribenzo(2,3-pyrido)porphyrazine {the formula (8)} represented by the above formula (6) where one among A to D is a pyridine ring and the rest three are benzene rings and copper benzotris(2,3-pyrido)porphyrazine represented by the above formula (6) where three among A to D are pyridine rings and the rest one is a benzene ring are by-produced and positional isomers of the pyridine ring nitrogen atom {the formulas (9-A) to (9-D)} further exist in these compounds, resulting in a<br><br>
complex mixture. Furthermore, copper tetrakis(2,3-pyrido)porphyrazine and copper phthalocyanine (copper tetrabenzoporphyrazine) are also produced even in an small amount. In general, it is difficult to isolate only the intended product from these mixtures, which are used intact in most cases as copper iibenzobis(2,3-pyrido)porphyrazine because two are pyridine rings and the rest two are benzene rings on average.<br>
In the above description, copper dibenzobis(2,3-pyrido)porphyrazine where two Df A to D are pyridine rings and the rest two are benzene rings is mentioned. Even in :he case of a nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring except for pyridine, the compound where two are said nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic rings and the rest wo are benzene rings can be obtained as well by carrying out synthesis according to the above, corresponding to said nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring. Moreover, it can be obtained as well, in the case of a compound having 1 or 3 nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic rings; a mixture of a compound having 1 nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring and a compound having 2 and/or 3 nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic rings; or the like, by changing the use ratio of the nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring dicarboxylic acid derivative and the phthalic acid derivative depending on the ratio of the nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring and the benzene ring of the intended compound so that the ratio is in the range of about 0.25 mol to 0.75 mol and the total of the both is 1 mol. [0050]<br><br><br><br><br>
[0053]<br>
Next, the copper chlorosulfonylporphyrazine compound represented by the<br>
formula (3) is obtained by chlorosulfonation of the copper porphyrazine coloring<br>
matter represented by the formula (6) in chlorosulfonic acid, or by sulfonation of the<br>
copper porphyrazine coloring matter represented by the formula (6) in sulfuric acid or<br>
fuming sulfuric acid followed by conversion of the sulfo group into a chlorosulfone<br>
group with a chlorination agent. By the above sulfonation, the sulfo group is not<br>
introduced on the heteroaromatic ring group but introduced on the benzene ring, in A<br>
'	to D of the formula (6). A sulfo group is typically introduced on a benzene ring, so the<br>
number of sulfo groups introduced is within the number of benzene rings. Therefore, the number of chlorosulfone groups (n) in the formula (3) derived from said sulfo group is 1 to 3 corresponding to the number of benzene rings of the compound of the formula (3). The intended compound of the formula (3) can be obtained by another synthesis method of copper chlorosulfonylporphyrazine compound represented by the formula (3), where the copper porphyrazine coloring matter having a sulfo group represented by the formula (10) is synthesized by cyclocondensation with sulfophthalic acid having a sulfo group and a nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring<br><br>
dicarboxylic acid derivative such as quinolinic acid, followed by conversion of the sulfo group into a chlorosulfone group. The number of SO2CI groups (n) in the obtained compound of the formula (3) is 1 to 3 on average and preferably 2 to 3 on average, as above. [0054]<br><br>
(v\/herein. A, B, C, D and n have the same meanings as in the above formula (3)) [0055]<br>
The conditions of chlorosulfonation reaction of the copper porphyrazine coloring matter are that chlorosulfonic acid is typically used as a solvent and the use amount is 3 to 20 time by weight of the porphyrazine coloring matter and preferably 5 to 10 time by weight. The reaction temperature is typically 100 to 150°C and preferably 120 to 150'C. The reaction time varies depending to the reaction conditions such as reaction temperature, however typically 1 to 10 hours. In this case, the substituent of the copper porphyrazine compound typically obtained is a mixture of a chlorosulfone group and a sulfo group, so it is preferable in the present invention that a chlorination agent such as thionyl chloride other than chlorosulfonic acid is further added to the reaction solution with chlorosulfonic acid to carry out the reaction so that all the sulfo groups are chlorosulfonated. The amount of the chlorination agent other than the chlorosulfonic acid to be added is about 0.5 to 10 equivalents and preferably 0.5 to 5 equivalents relative to the sulfo group in the sulfo-substituted copper porphyrazine coloring matter. The chlorination agent includes chlorosulfonic acid, thionyl chloride, sulfuryl chloride, phosphorus trichloride, phosphorus pentachloride, phosphorus oxychloride and the like, but not limited thereto.<br><br>
[0056]<br>
In addition, the copper chlorosulfonylporphyrazine compound is also obtained by reacting a chlorination agent with the copper porphyrazine coloring matter having a sulfo group represented by the following formula (10) for conversion of the sulfo group into a chlorosulfone group. The solvent to be used for chlorination reaction includes sulfuric acid, fuming sulfuric acid, chlorosulfonic acid, benzene, toluene, nitrobenzene, chlorobenzene, N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetoamide and the like, but not limited thereto. Further, the chlorination agent includes the same as above. But it is not limited to them. [0057]<br>
Next, the intended compound of the formula (1) can be obtained by reaction of the copper chlorosulfonylporphyrazine compound obtained above and the organic amine represented by the following formula (4) in the presence of ammonia (or in the presence of an aminating agent) in a water solvent, typically at pH 8 to 10 and typically 5 to 70°C, typically for 1 to 20 hours. Ammonia or ammonia source to be used for the reaction (the both are also together referred to as an aminating agent) includes, for example, ammonium salts such as ammonium chloride and ammonium sulfate, urea, ammonia water, ammonia gas and the like, but not limited thereto. In addition, the reaction of the copper chlorosulfonylporphyrazine coloring matter, organic amine and an aminating agent is typically carried out in a water solvent. [0058]<br><br>
(wherein, E, X and Y have the same meanings as above) [0059]<br>
In this connection, the use amount of organic amine is typically 1 time mol or<br><br>
more of the theoretical value (the mole number required for c value in the formula (1) to be 0.1 to 3) relative to 1 mol of the copper chlorosulfonylporphyrazine coloring matter, but it varies depending on the reactivity of organic amine and the reaction conditions and not limited to these. It is typically 1 to 3 time mol of the theoretical value, and preferably 1 to 2 time mol, approximately. [0060]<br>
The method to produce the organic amine represented by the formula (4) will be explained. The organic amine represented by the formula (4) can be produced by a known method. For example, 0.95 to 1.1 mol of a substituted aniline corresponding to X is reacted with 1 mol of 2,4,6-trichloro-S-triazine (cyanuric chloride)in water at pH 3 to 7 and a reaction temperature of 5 to 40°C for 2 to 12 hours to obtain a first condensate. Next, when Y is an amino group, 1 mol of the obtained first condensate and 0.95 to 2.0 mol of ammonia are reacted at pH 4 to 10 and a reaction temperature of 5 to 80°C for 0.5 to 12 hours to obtain a second condensate. On the other hand, when Y is a hydroxy group, a hydroxide of an alkali metal such as sodium hydroxide is added to the reaction solution of the first condensate, which is reacted at pH 4 to 10 and a reaction temperature of 5 to 80°C for 0.5 to 12 hours to obtain a second condensate. Next, 1 mol of the obtained second condensate and 1 to 50 mol of an alkylene diamines corresponding to E are reacted at pH 9 to 12 and a reaction temperature of 5 to 90'C for 0.5 to 8 hours to obtain a compound of the above formula (4). In condensation, the pH adjuster includes a hydroxide of an alkali metal such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, a carbonate of an alkali metal such as sodium carbonate or potassium carbonate, or the like. In this connection, the sequence order of condensation is arbitrarily determined according to the reactivity of each compound and not limited to the above mentioned. [0061]<br>
In addition, it can be theoretically considered that, because the copper porphyrazine coloring matter represented by the above formula (1) or (2) is synthesized by reaction of copper chlorosulfonylporphyrazine represented by the<br><br>
above formula (3) and organic amine represented by the above formula (4) in the presence of ammonia, a compound where some of the chlorosulfonyl group in the formula (3) is hydrolyzed with mixing water existing in the reaction system and converted into a sulfonic acid group is by-produced, resulting in that said by-product compound mixes in the intended coloring matter represented by the formula (1) or (2). It is, however, difficult to distinguish unsubstituted sulfamoyi group from sulfonic acid group in mass spectrometric analysis, so in the present invention, chlorosulfonyl groups in formula (3) except for chlorosulfonyl groups reacted with organic amine represented by the formula (4) are all described as converted into unsubstituted sulfamoyi groups.<br>
In addition, some of the copper porphyrazine coloring matter represented by the above formula (1) or (2) may have by-product impurities where copper porphyrazine ring (Pz) forms a dimer (for example, Pz-L-Pz) or a trimer (Pz-L-Pz-L-Pz or the like) via a divalent linking group (L), which is mixed into the reaction product. In this connection, the divalent linking group represented by the above L includes -SO2-, -SO2-NH-SO2- and the like. [0062]<br>
The copper porphyrazine coloring matter of the present invention thus obtained can be separated by filtration and the like after adding out or salting out. Salting out is preferably carried out, for example, under acidic to alkali conditions, preferably in the range of pH 1 to 11. The temperature in salting out is not particularly limited, but it is preferred to heat typically to 40 to 80°C, preferably 50 to TO'C, and then add a sodium chloride and the like for salting out. [0063]<br>
The copper porphyrazine coloring matter represented by the above formula (1) or the formula (2) synthesized by the above method is obtained in free acid form or a salt form thereof. Its free acid form can be obtained, for example, by adding out. On the other hand, its salt form can be obtained by salting out; or for example, by applying a typical salt exchange method of adding a desired organic or inorganic<br><br>
base to its free acid form if the desired salt can not be obtained by salting out. [0064]<br>
Next, the ink of the present invention will be explained. The porphyrazine coloring matter of the above formula (1) or the salt thereof produced by the above method exhibits a vivid cyan. Therefore, an ink containing these can be also used mainly as a cyan ink. Said ink can be used not only as a cyan ink having a high concentration but also as a cyan ink having a low concentration of the coloring matter (which is called light cyan ink, photo cyan ink or the like) which is used to reproduce the graduation part of image smoothly or to decrease granular quality of the hypochromic region.

In the latter case, alcohol to be used is a lower alcohol having a 1 to 4 carbon atoms, preferably an alcohol having 1 to 3 carbon atoms, and further preferably methanol, ethanol or 2-propanol. In desalting treatment of the latter, a method of heating to the boiling point of the alcohol to be used and then cooling for desalination can be also employed. The porphyrazine<br><br>
coloring matter of the present invention having a small content of Cl- and SO42- in a dry state can be obtained by that the porphyrazine coloring matter of the present invention subjected to desalting treatment in a mixed solvent of alcohol and water is separated by filtration in an conventional manner and then dried.

In addition, the compounds of the above formula (1) synthesized in Examples are all mixtures containing the isomers and the like as described above, so the compound of the main component (or the chemical structural formula as one of them) is described unless otherwise specifically noted. The described yield is a yield which still contains said isomers and the like. [0094] 1. Method of Mass Spectrometric Analysis<br>
Confirmation that the intended compound is produced was carried out by LC-MS (high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometer). It can be confirmed by LC-MS that the substituted sulfamoyl group in the above formula (1) is<br><br>
introduced. Ion peaks of the compound where one of A to D is a pyridine ring and the   compound where two of A to D are pyridine rings, which can be detected by LC-MS, are shown in the following Table 101. [0095] [Table 101]<br><br>
[0096]<br>
It is found from Table 101 that monovalent and divalent ion peaks are detected when c is 1. Likewise, divalent and trivalent ion peaks are detected when c is 2, and trivalent ion peak is detected when c is 3, respectively. As just described, there is difference in the ion valence number, but the intended compound represented by the formula (1) can be detected.<br>
In this connection, the synthesized compound is actually a mixture, so the values of b and c are average values determined from the strength of each ion peak.<br>
The compound where two of A to D are pyridine rings can also be likewise confirmed by LC-MS.<br><br>

From this amount-fixed solution, 1 ml was weighed into a 50 ml measuring flask with a whole pipette, and a certain amount of Y (yttrium) was added thereto as an internal standard material, the amount was fixed with deionized water to 50 ml and then determined by ICP emission spectroscopy. [0099]<br>
3.	Method of Measuring Xmax<br>
Apparatus: UV-2100 (manufactured by Shimadzu Corporation) 1) Measurement in Aqueous Solution<br><br>
In ion-exchanged water, 0.14 g of the sample was dissolved, the pH was adjusted to the range of 7.0 to 9.0 with sodium hydroxide, and then the amount was adjusted to 500ml by using a 500ml measuring flask. With a whole pipette, 10ml was taken by weighing from this amount-fixed solution into a 100 ml measuring flask, and the amount was fixed with ion-exchanged water to 100 ml, followed by determination. 2) Measurement in Pyridine<br>
Pyridine was added to several mg of the sample until the solid could not be seen by visual observation, and this was measured.<br>
In this connection, every compound measured in pyridine had extremely low solubility in solvent, so the measured value is a reference value. [0100] Example 1<br>
