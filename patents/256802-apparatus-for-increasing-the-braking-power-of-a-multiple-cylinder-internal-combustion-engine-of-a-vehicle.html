achieved in the sense of a variable turbine geometry when the shut-off valves (10, 11) are open and the exhaust-gas lines (5, 6) are traversable in specified charging and/or rotational-speed ranges of the engine by purposeful opening, keeping open and closing again of the valves (14, 15) and thus, in an associated manner, a purposeful intro¬duction of a jet of gas into the exhaust-gas turbine (9) in addition to the two normal volume flows of exhaust gas.<br>
