Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to viral vaccines and, more particularly, to<br>
filovirus vaccines and methods of eliciting an immune response against a filovirus or a<br>
disease caused by infection with filovirus.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Ebola virus and Marburg virus make up the family Filoviridae. The family is<br>
divided into two genera, currently designated as "Ebola-like viruses" and "Marburg-like<br>
viruses." There are four subtypes within the "Ebola-like viruses," Zaire (type species),<br>
Sudan, Reston, and C6te d'lvoire (Ivory Coast). A single type, Marburg virus, makes up<br>
the "Marburg-like viruses."<br>
The glycoprotein (GP) is the sole structural protein making up the virion surface<br>
spikes that mediate virus entry into susceptible host cells through receptor binding. GP is<br>
the most studied of the filovirus proteins, not only for its importance in virus entry and<br>
pathogenesis but because it is a prime target for vaccine development. Research on<br>
filovirus GP has been facilitated through the use of recombinant DNA technology to permit<br>
biochemical and functional assays without the constraints of working with the infectious<br>
filovirus.<br>
GP expression in cultured human endothelial and epithelial cells causes cell<br>
rounding and detachment (Yang Z.-Y. et al. 2000 Nat Med 6:886-889). These effects<br>
require the presence of the mucin-like serine and threonine -rich domain of GP. The<br>
cytotoxic effects of GP on macrophage and endothelial cell function disrupt inflammatory<br>
cell function and the integrity of the vasculature. In addition, by altering the cell surface<br>
expression of adhesion proteins and immune recognition molecules, Ebola virus may<br>
disrupt processes critical to immune activation and cytolytic-T-cell function. These<br>
phenomena likely account for the dysregulation of the inflammatory response and the<br>
vascular dysfunction characteristic of lethal Ebola virus infection, providing a rationale for<br>
focusing on GP as a target for a preventative vaccine.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The invention is related to a nucleic acid molecule comprising a polynucleotide<br>
encoding a modified filovirus glycoprotein (GP) having at least one amino acid change<br>
located in a relatively conserved region of said GP that decreases in vitro cytotoxicity and<br>
retains immunogenicity when compared to in vitro cytotoxicity and immunogenicity of a<br>
wild type filovirus GP.<br>
In one embodiment, the amino acid change is positioned in the N-terminal domain,<br>
excluding,the conserved cysteine residues, and is located at amino acid position 50, 51, 52,<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
In the absence of effective therapies for Ebola virus infection, the development of a<br>
vaccine becomes an important strategy to contain outbreaks. Immunization with DNA<br>
and/or replication-defective adenoviral (rAd) vectors encoding the Ebola glycoprotein (GP)<br>
and nucleoprotein (NP) has been previously shown to confer specific protective immunity<br>
in nonhuman primates (Sullivan, N. J. et al. 2000 Nature 408:605-609; Sullivan, N. J. et al.<br>
2003 Nature 424:681-684). GP can exert cytopathic effects on transfected cells in vitro<br>
(Yang, Z.-Y. et al. 2000 NatMed 6:886-889) and multiple GP forms have been identified in<br>
nature, raising the question of which would be optimal for a human vaccine. To address<br>
this question, we have explored the efficacy of mutant GPs from multiple Ebola virus<br>
strains with reduced in vitro cytopathicity and analyzed their protective effects in the<br>
primate challenge model, with or without NP. Deletion of the GP transmembrane domain<br>
eliminated in vitro cytopathicity but reduced its protective efficacy by at least one order of<br>
magnitude. In contrast, single point mutations were identified that abolish in vitro<br>
cytopathicity but retained immunogenicity and conferred immune protection in the absence<br>
of NP. The minimal effective rAd dose was established at 1010 particles, two logs lower<br>
than used previously. Expression of specific GPs alone vectored by rAd are sufficient to<br>
confer protection against lethal challenge in a relevant nonhuman primate model, providing<br>
the basis for identification of a vaccine.<br>
Definitions<br>
Unless defined otherwise, technical and scientific terms used herein have the same<br>
meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention<br>
belongs. See, e.g., Singleton P and Sainsbury D., Dictionary of Microbiology and<br>
Molecular Biology 3rd ed., J. Wiley &amp; Sons, Chichester, New York, 2001, and Fields<br>

Philadelphia 2001.<br>
Nucleic Acid Molecules<br>
As indicated herein, nucleic acid molecules of the present invention may be in the<br>
form of RNA or in the form of DNA obtained by cloning or produced synthetically. The<br>
DNA may be double-stranded or single-stranded. Single-stranded DNA or RNA may be<br>
the coding strand, also known as the sense strand, or it may be the non-coding strand, also<br>
referred to as the anti-sense strand.<br>
By "isolated" nucleic acid molecule(s) is intended a nucleic acid molecule, DNA or<br>
RNA, which has been removed from its native environment. For example, recombinant<br>
DNA molecules contained in a vector are considered isolated for the purposes of the<br>
present invention. Further examples of isolated DNA molecules include recombinant DNA<br>
molecules maintained in heterologous host cells or purified (partially or substantially) DNA<br>
molecules in solution. Isolated RNA molecules include in vivo or in vitro RNA transcripts<br>
of the DNA molecules of the present invention. Isolated nucleic acid molecules according<br>
to the present invention further include such molecules produced synthetically.<br>
Nucleic acid molecules of the present invention include DNA molecules comprising<br>
an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a modified filovirus structural gene product; and<br>
DNA molecules which comprise a sequence substantially different from those described<br>
above but which, due to the degeneracy of the genetic code, still encode an ORF of a<br>
modified filovirus structural gene product. Of course, the genetic code is well known in the<br>
art. Degenerate variants optimized for human codon usage are preferred.<br>
A filovirus structural gene product, e.g., glycoprotein (GP), the sole structural<br>
protein making up the virion surface spikes that mediate virus entry into susceptible host<br>
cells through receptor binding, is modified by having at least one amino acid change that<br>
decreases in vitro cytotoxicity and retains immunogenicity when compared to in vitro<br>
cytotoxicity and immunogenicity of a wild type (e.g., naturally occurring) filovirus GP.<br>
The amino acids of particular importance to the in vitro cytotoxicity are by no means<br>
limited to the exact position as defined for the, e.g., Zaire strain of Ebola virus but are<br>
simply used in an exemplary manner to point out the preferred amino acids being at that<br>
position or corresponding to that position in other strains such as found in Sudan strain of<br>
Ebola virus or Angola strain of Marburg virus and filoviruses in general since they are<br>
highly conserved. For filoviruses other than the Ebola Zaire strain the numbering of the<br>
positions of the preferred amino acids is often different but an expert in the field of the<br>
molecular biology of filoviruses will easily identify these preferred amino acids by their<br>
position relative to the highly conserved amino acids of said glycoprotein.<br>
The present invention is further directed to fragments of the nucleic acid molecules<br>
described herein. By a fragment of a nucleic acid molecule having the nucleotide sequence<br>
of an ORF encoding a modified filovirus structural gene product is intended fragments at<br>
least about 15 nt, and more preferably at least about 20 nt., still more preferably at least<br>
about 30 nt., and even more preferably, at least about 40 nt. in length. Of course, larger<br>
fragments 50,100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350,400,450, or 500 nt. in length are also intended<br>
according to the present invention as are fragments corresponding to most, if not all, of the<br>
nucleotide sequence of the ORF encoding a modified filovirus structural gene product. By<br>
a fragment at least 20 nt. in length, for example, is intended fragments which include 20 or<br>
more contiguous bases from the nucleotide sequence of the ORF encoding a modified<br>
filovirus structural gene product.<br>
Preferred nucleic acid fragments of the present invention include nucleic acid<br>
molecules encoding epitope-bearing portions of the filovirus structural protein. In<br>
particular, such nucleic acid fragments of the present invention include nucleic acid<br>
molecules encoding epitope-bearing domains of a filovirus structural protein, where the<br>
domain is the N-terminal domain, the mucin-like domain, the furin cleavage site, the fusion<br>
peptide domain, the coiled-coli domain, the membrane spanning domain, and the<br>
intracellular domain, and any combination thereof, for example, a filovirus glycoprotein<br>
having a truncation at the carboxy terminus to delete the membrane spanning and<br>
intracellular domain, a filovirus glycoprotein having a truncation at the carboxy terminus to<br>
delete the coiled-coil domain and membrane-spanning and intracellular domain, a filovirus<br>
glycoprotein having a truncation at the carboxy terminus to delete the fusion peptide<br>
domain, coiled-coil domain, and membrane-spanning and intracellular domain, a filovirus<br>
glycoprotein having a truncation at the carboxy terminus to delete the furin cleavage site,<br>
fusion peptide domain, coiled-coil domain, and membrane-spanning and intracellular<br>
domain, a filovirus glycoprotein having a truncation at the carboxy terminus to delete the<br>
mucin-like domain, furin cleavage site, fusion peptide domain, coiled-coil domain, and<br>
membrane-spanning and intracellular domain. Another example is a filovirus glycoprotein<br>
having an amino, internal, or carboxy deletion to delete the mucin-like domain, the furin<br>
cleavage site, the fusion peptide domain, the coiled-coil domain, the membrane-spanning<br>
domain, or the intracellular domain.<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides a nucleic acid molecule comprising a<br>
polynucleotide which hybridizes under stringent hybridization conditions to a portion of the<br>
polynucleotide in a nucleic acid molecule of the invention described above. By "stringent<br>
hybridization conditions" is intended overnight incubation at 42°C in a solution<br>
comprising: 50% formamide, 5 x SSC (750 mM NaCl, 75 mM trisodium citrate), 50 mM<br>
sodium phosphate (pH 7.6), 5 x Denhardt's solution, 10% dextran sulfate, and 20 }j,g/ml<br>
denatured, sheared salmon sperm DNA, followed by washing the filters in 0.1 x SSC at<br>
about 65°C.<br>
By a polynucleotide which hybridizes to a "portion" of a polynucleotide is intended<br>
a polynucleotide (either DNA or RNA) hybridizing to at least about 15 nucleotides (nt),<br>
and more preferably at least about 20 nt., still more preferably at least about 30 nt, and<br>
even more preferably about 30-70 nt. of the reference polynucleotide.<br>
By a portion of a polynucleotide of "at least 20 nt. in length," for example, is<br>
intended 20 or more contiguous nucleotides from the nucleotide sequence of the reference<br>
polynucleotide. Of course, a polynucleotide which hybridizes only to a poly A sequence or<br>
a complementary stretch of T (or U) residues, would not be included in a polynucleotide of<br>
the invention used to hybridize to a portion of a nucleic acid of the invention, since such a<br>
polynucleotide would hybridize to any nucleic acid molecule containing a poly A stretch or<br>
the complement thereof (e.g., practically any double-stranded cDNA clone).<br>
As indicated herein, nucleic acid molecules of the present invention which encode a<br>
filo virus structural gene product may include, but are not limited to those encoding the<br>
amino acid sequence of the full-length polypeptide, by itself, the coding sequence for the<br>
full-length polypeptide and additional sequences, such as those encoding a leader or<br>
secretory sequence, such as a pre-, or pro- or prepro-protein sequence, the coding sequence<br>
of the full-length polypeptide, with or without the aforementioned additional coding<br>
sequences, together with additional, non-coding sequences, including for example, but not<br>
limited to introns and non-coding 5' and 3' sequences, such as the transcribed, nontranslated<br>
sequences that play a role in transcription, mRNA processing, including splicing<br>
and polyadenylation signals, for example, ribosome binding and stability of mRNA; and<br>
additional coding sequence which codes for additional amino acids, such as those which<br>
provide additional functionalities.<br>
The present invention further relates to variants of the nucleic acid molecules of the<br>
present invention, which encode portions, analogs or derivatives of the filovirus structural<br>
gene product. Variants may occur naturally, such as a natural allelic variant. By an "allelic<br>
variant" is intended one of several alternate forms of a gene occupying a given locus on a<br>
genome of an organism. (Genes II, Lewin, B., ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1985 New York).<br>
Non-naturally occurring variants may be produced using art-known mutagenesis<br>
techniques.<br>
Such variants include those produced by nucleotide substitutions, deletions or<br>
additions, which may involve one or more nucleotides. The variants may be altered in<br>
coding regions, non-coding regions, or both. Alterations in the coding regions may produce<br>
conservative or non-conservative amino acid substitutions, deletions or additions.<br>
Especially preferred among these are silent substitutions, additions and deletions, which do<br>
not alter the properties and activities of the filovirus structural gene product or portions<br>
thereof. Also especially preferred in this regard are conservative substitutions.<br>
Further embodiments of the invention include nucleic acid molecules comprising a<br>
polynucleotide having a nucleotide sequence at least 95% identical, and more preferably at<br>
least 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to a nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide<br>
having the amino acid sequence of a modified filovirus structural gene product or fragment<br>
thereof or a nucleotide sequence complementary thereto.<br>
By a polynucleotide having a nucleotide sequence at least, for example, 95%<br>
"identical" to a reference nucleotide sequence encoding a filovirus structural gene product<br>
is intended that the nucleotide sequence of the polynucleotide is identical to the reference<br>
sequence except that the polynucleotide sequence may include up to five point mutations<br>
per each 100 nucleotides of the reference nucleotide sequence encoding the Ebola virus<br>
structural gene product, hi other words, to obtain a polynucleotide having a nucleotide<br>
sequence at least 95% identical to a reference nucleotide sequence, up to 5% of the<br>
nucleotides in the reference sequence maybe deleted or substituted with another nucleotide,<br>
or a number of nucleotides up to 5% of the total nucleotides in the reference sequence may<br>
be inserted into the reference sequence. These mutations of the reference sequence may<br>
occur at the 5' or 3' terminal positions of the reference nucleotide sequence or anywhere<br>
between those terminal positions, interspersed either individually among nucleotides in the<br>
reference sequence or in one or more contiguous groups within the reference sequence.<br>
As a practical matter, whether any particular nucleic acid molecule is at least 95%,<br>
96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to the reference nucleotide sequence can be determined<br>
conventionally using known computer programs such as the Bestfit program (Wisconsin<br>
Sequence Analysis Package, Version 8 for Unix, Genetics Computer Group, University<br>
Research Park, 575 Science Drive, Madison, Wis. 53711). Bestfit uses the local homology<br>
algorithm of Smith and Waterman 1981 Advances in Applied Mathematics 2:482-489, to<br>
find the best segment of homology between two sequences. When using Bestfit or any<br>
other sequence alignment program to determine whether a particular sequence is, for<br>
instance, 95% identical to a reference sequence according to the present invention, the<br>
parameters are set, of course, such that the percentage of identity is calculated over the full<br>
length of the reference nucleotide sequence and that gaps in homology of up to 5% of the<br>
total number of nucleotides in the reference sequence are allowed.<br>
The present application is directed to nucleic acid molecules at least 95%, 96%,<br>
97%, 98% or 99% identical to the nucleic acid sequences described herein which encode a<br>
polypeptide having Ebola or Marburg polypeptide activity. By "a polypeptide having Ebola<br>
or Marburg, polypeptide activity" is intended polypeptides exhibiting Ebola or Marburg<br>
polypeptide activity in a particular biological assay. For example, GP polypeptide activity<br>
can be measured for changes in biological activity such as receptor binding activity,<br>
connection between GPI and GP2, and contribution to the formation of the stalk structure<br>
of the virion peplomer, and modified GP polypeptide activity by decrease of in vitro<br>
cytotoxicity while retaining immunogenicity.<br>
Of course, due to the degeneracy of the genetic code, one of ordinary skill in the art<br>
will immediately recognize that a large number of the nucleic acid molecules having a<br>
sequence at least 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical to a nucleic acid sequence<br>
described herein will encode a polypeptide "having Ebola or Marburg polypeptide activity".<br>
In fact, since degenerate variants of these nucleotide sequences all encode the same<br>
polypeptide, this will be clear to the skilled artisan even without performing the above<br>
described comparison assay. It will be further recognized in the art that, for such nucleic<br>
acid molecules that are not degenerate variants, a reasonable number will also encode a<br>
polypeptide having Ebola or Marburg polypeptide activity. This is because the skilled<br>
artisan is fully aware of amino acid substitutions that are either less likely or not likely to<br>
significantly effect protein function (e.g., replacing one aliphatic amino acid with a second<br>
aliphatic amino acid).<br>
For example, guidance concerning how to make phenotypically silent amino acid<br>
substitutions is provided in Bowie, J. U. et al. 1990 Science 247:1306-1310, wherein the<br>
authors indicate that proteins are surprisingly tolerant of amino acid substitutions.<br>
Polypeptides and Fragments<br>
The invention further provides a filovirus polypeptide having the amino acid<br>
sequence encoded by an open reading frame (ORF) of a modified filovirus structural gene,<br>
or a peptide or polypeptide comprising a portion thereof (e.g., soluble GP).<br>
It will be recognized in the art that some amino acid sequences of the filovirus<br>
polypeptides can be varied without significant effect of the structure or function of the<br>
protein. If such differences hi sequence are contemplated, it should be remembered that<br>
there will be critical areas on the protein which determine activity.<br>
Thus, the invention further includes variations of the filovirus polypeptide which<br>
show substantial filovirus polypeptide activity or which include regions of filovirus protein<br>
such as the protein portions discussed below. Such mutants include deletions, insertions,<br>
inversions, repeats, and type substitutions. As indicated, guidance concerning which amino<br>
acid changes are likely to be phenotypically silent can be found in Bowie, J.U. et al. 1990<br>
Science 247:1306-1310.<br>
Thus, the fragment, derivative or analog of the polypeptide of the invention may be<br>
(i) one in which one or more of the amino acid residues are substituted with a conserved or<br>
non-conserved amino acid residue (preferably a conserved amino acid residue) and such<br>
substituted amino acid residue may or may not be one encoded by the genetic code, or (ii)<br>
one in which one or more of the amino acid residues include a substituent group, or (iii) one<br>
in which additional amino acids are fused to the mature polypeptide, such as an IgG Fc<br>
fusion region peptide or leader or secretory sequence or a sequence which is employed for<br>
purification of the mature polypeptide or a proprotein sequence. Such fragments,<br>
derivatives and analogs are deemed to be within the scope of those skilled in the art from<br>
the teachings herein.<br>
As indicated, changes are preferably of a minor nature, such as conservative amino<br>
acid substitutions that do not significantly affect the folding or activity of the protein (see<br>
Table A).<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Of course, the number of amino acid substitutions a skilled artisan would make<br>
depends on many factors, including those described above. Generally speaking, the number<br>
of amino acid substitutions for any given filovirus polypeptide will not be more than 50,40,<br>
30, 20,10, 5 or 3.<br>
Amino acids in the filovirus polypeptides of the present invention that are essential<br>
for function can be identified by methods known in the art, such as site-directed<br>
mutagenesis or alanine-scanning mutagenesis (Cunningham &amp; Wells 1989 Science<br>
244:1081-1085). The latter procedure introduces single alanine mutations at every residue<br>
in the molecule. The resulting mutant molecules are then tested for biological activity such<br>
as receptor binding activity, connection between GP1 and GP2, and contribution to the<br>
formation of the stalk structure of the virion peplomer, and modified GP polypeptide<br>
activity by decrease of in vitro cytotoxicity while retaining immunogenicity.<br>
The polypeptides of the present invention are conveniently provided in an isolated<br>
form. By "isolated polypeptide" is intended a polypeptide removed from its native<br>
environment. Thus, a polypeptide produced and/or contained within a recombinant host<br>
cell is considered isolated for purposes of the present invention. Also intended as an<br>
"isolated polypeptide" are polypeptides that have been purified, partially or substantially,<br>
from a recombinant host cell or a native source. For example, a recombinantly produced<br>
version of the filovirus polypeptide can be substantially purified by the one-step method<br>
described in Smith and Johnson 1988 Gene 67:31-40.<br>
The polypeptides of the present invention include a polypeptide comprising a<br>
polypeptide having the amino acid sequence of a modified filovirus structural gene product<br>
or portion thereof or encoded by a nucleic acid sequence described herein; as well as<br>
polypeptides which are at least 95% identical, and more preferably at least 96%, 97%, 98%,<br>
or 99% identical to those described above and also include portions of such polypeptides<br>
with at least 30 amino acids and more preferably at least 50 amino acids.<br>
By a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence at least, for example, 95%<br>
"identical" to a reference amino acid sequence of an filovirus polypeptide is intended that<br>
the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide is identical to the reference sequence except<br>
that the polypeptide sequence may include up to five amino acid alterations per each 100<br>
amino acids of the reference amino acid of the filovirus polypeptide. In other words, to<br>
obtain a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence at least 95% identical to a reference<br>
amino acid sequence, up to 5% of the amino acid residues in the reference sequence may be<br>
deleted or substituted with another amino acid, or a number of amino acids up to 5% of the<br>
total amino acid residues in the reference sequence may be inserted into the reference<br>
sequence. These alterations of the reference sequence may occur at the amino or carboxy<br>
terminal positions of the reference amino acid sequence or anywhere between those<br>
terminal positions, interspersed either individually among residues in the reference<br>
sequence or in one or more contiguous groups within the reference sequence.<br>
As a practical matter, whether any particular polypeptide is at least 95%, 96%, 97%,<br>
98%, or 99% identical to a reference amino acid sequence can be determined<br>
conventionally using known computer programs such the Bestfit program (Wisconsin<br>
Sequence Analysis Package, Version 8 for Unix, Genetics Computer Group, University<br>
Research Park, 575 Science Drive, Madison, Wis. 53711). When using Bestfit or any other<br>
sequence alignment program to determine whether a particular sequence is, .for instance,<br>
95% identical to a reference sequence according to the present invention, the parameters are<br>
set, of course, such that the percentage of identity is calculated over the full length of the<br>
reference amino acid sequence and that gaps in homology of up to 5% of the total number<br>
of amino acid residues hi the reference sequence are allowed.<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides portions of the polypeptides described<br>
herein with at least 30 amino acids and more preferably at least 50 amino acids. Preferred<br>
portions of the present invention include polypeptides comprising an epitope-bearing<br>
portion of a filovirus structural protein. In particular, preferred portions of the present<br>
invention include polypeptides comprising an epitope-bearing domain of a filovirus<br>
structural protein, where the domain is the N-terminal domain, the mucin-like domain, the<br>
furin cleavage site, the fusion peptide domain, the coiled-coil domain, the membranespanning<br>
domain, and the intracellular domain, and any combination thereof, for example, a<br>
filovirus glycoprotein having a truncation at the carboxy terminus to delete the membrane<br>
spanning and intracellular domain, a filovirus glycoprotein having a truncation at the<br>
carboxy terminus to delete the coiled-coil domain and membrane spanning and intracellular<br>
domain, a filovirus glycoprotein having a truncation at the carboxy terminus to delete the<br>
fusion peptide domain, coiled-coil domain, and membrane-spanning and intracellular<br>
domain, a filovirus glycoprotein having a truncation at the carboxy terminus to delete the<br>
furin cleavage site, fusion peptide domain, coiled-coil domain, and membrane-spanning and<br>
intracellular domain, and a filovirus glycoprotein having a truncation at the carboxy<br>
terminus to delete the mucin-like domain, furin cleavage site, fusion peptide domain,<br>
coiled-coil domain, and membrane-spanning and intracellular domain. Another example is<br>
a filovirus glycoprotein having an amino, internal, or carboxy deletion to delete the mucinlike<br>
domain, the furin cleavage site, the fusion peptide domain, the coiled-coil domain, the<br>
membrane-spanning domain, or the intracellular domain.<br>
The polypeptides of the invention may be produced by any conventional means<br>
(Houghten, R.A. 1985 PNAS USA 82:5131-5135). The "Simultaneous Multiple Peptide<br>
Synthesis (SMPS)" process is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,631,211 to Houghten et al.<br>
(1986).<br>
The present invention also relates to vectors which include the nucleic acid<br>
molecules of the present invention, host cells which are genetically engineered with the<br>
recombinant vectors, and the production of filovirus polypeptides or fragments thereof by<br>
recombinant techniques.<br>
The polynucleotides may be joined to a vector containing a selectable marker for<br>
propagation in a host. Generally, a plasmid vector is introduced in a precipitate, such as a<br>
calcium phosphate precipitate, or in a complex with a charged lipid. If the vector is a virus,<br>
it may be packaged in vitro using an appropriate packaging cell line and then transduced<br>
into host cells.<br>
The DNA insert should be operatively linked to an appropriate promoter, such as<br>
the phage lambda PL promoter, the E. coli lac, trp and tac promoters, the SV40 early and<br>
late promoters and promoters of retroviral LTRs, to name a few. Other suitable promoters<br>
will be known to the skilled artisan. The expression constructs will further contain sites for<br>
transcription initiation, termination and, in the transcribed region, a ribosome binding site<br>
for translation. The coding portion of the mature transcripts expressed by the constructs<br>
will preferably include a translation initiation at the beginning and a termination codon<br>
(UAA, UGA or UAG) appropriately positioned at the end of the polypeptide to be<br>
translated.<br>
As indicated, the expression vectors will preferably include at least one selectable<br>
marker. Such markers include dihydrofolate reductase or neomycin resistance for<br>
eukaryotic cell culture and tetracycline or ampicillin resistance genes for culturing E. coli<br>
and other bacteria. Representative examples of appropriate hosts include, but are not<br>
limited to, bacterial cells, such as E. coli, Streptomyces and Salmonella typhimurium cells;<br>
fungal cells, such as yeast cells; insect cells such as Drosophila S2 and Spodoptera Sf9<br>
cells; animal cells such as CHO, COS and Bowes melanoma cells; and plant cells.<br>
Appropriate culture mediums and conditions for the above-described host cells are known<br>
in the art.<br>
Among vectors preferred for use hi bacteria include pQE70, pQE60, and pQE-9,<br>
available from Qiagen; pBS vectors, Phagescript vectors, Bluescript vectors, pNHSA,<br>
pNH16a, pHN18A, pNH46A, available from Stratagene; and ptrc99a, pKK223-3, pKK233-<br>
3, pDR540, pRITS available from Pharmacia. Among preferred eukaryotic vectors are<br>
pWLNEO, pSV2CAT, pOG44, pXTl and pSG available from Stratagene; and pSVK3,<br>
pBPV, pMSG and pSVL available from Pharmacia. Other suitable vectors will be readily<br>
apparent to the skilled artisan.<br>
Introduction of the construct into the host cell can be effected by calcium phosphate<br>
transfection, DEAE-dextran mediated transfection, cationic lipid-mediated transfection,<br>
electroporation, transduction, infection or other methods. Such methods are described hi<br>
many standard laboratory manuals, such as Davis et al., Basic Methods hi Molecular<br>
Biology (1986).<br>
The filovirus polypeptides can be recovered and purified from recombinant cell<br>
cultures by well known methods including ammonium sulfate or ethanol precipitation, acid<br>
extraction, anion or cation exchange chromatography, phosphocellulose chromatography,<br>
hydrophobic interaction chromatography, affinity chromatography, hydroxylapatite<br>
chromatography and lectin chromatography. Most preferably, high performance liquid<br>
chromatography ("HPLC") is employed for purification. Polypeptides of the present<br>
invention include naturally purified products, products of chemical synthetic procedures,<br>
and products produced by recombinant techniques from a prokaryotic or eukaryotic host,<br>
including, for example, bacterial, yeast, higher plant, insect and mammalian cells.<br>
Depending upon the host employed in a recombinant production procedure, the<br>
polypeptides of the present invention may be glycosylated or may be non-glycosylated. In<br>
addition, polypeptides of the invention may also include an initial modified methionine<br>
residue, in some cases as a result of host-mediated processes.<br>
Antibodies<br>
Also comprehended by the present invention are antibodies (e.g., monoclonal and<br>
polyclonal antibodies, single-chain antibodies, chimeric antibodies, humanized, human, and<br>
CDR-grafted antibodies, including compounds which include CDR sequences which<br>
specifically recognize a polypeptide of the invention) and other binding proteins specific for<br>
filovirus GP polypeptides or fragments thereof. The term "specific for" indicates that the<br>
variable regions of the antibodies of the invention recognize and bind a filovirus GP<br>
polypeptide exclusively (i.e., are able to distinguish a filovirus GP polypeptide from related<br>
polypeptides despite sequence identity, homology, or similarity found in the family of<br>
polypeptides), but may also interact with other proteins through interactions with sequences<br>
outside the variable region of the antibodies, and in particular, in the constant region of the<br>
molecule. Screening assays to determine binding specificity of an antibody of the invention<br>
are well known and routinely practiced in the art. For a comprehensive discussion of such<br>
assays, see Antibodies A Laboratory Manual. Harlow et al. (Eds), Cold Spring Harbor<br>
Laboratory; Cold Spring Harbor, NY (1988), Chapter 6. Antibodies that recognize and<br>
bind fragments of the filovirus GP polypeptides of the invention are also contemplated,<br>
provided that the antibodies are first and foremost specific for, as defined above, a filovirus<br>
GP polypeptide of the invention from which the fragment was derived. The specific<br>
antibodies of the invention are envisioned as having utility for diagnostic purposes and<br>
passive immunization.<br>
Use of Recombinant Virus to Induce Immune Response to Antigen<br>
The present invention relates to generation of a CD8+ T cell immune response<br>
against an antigen and also eliciting an antibody response. More particularly, the present<br>
invention relates to "accelerated" immunization regimes in which the immune response is<br>
induced by administration of a single dose form and "prime and boost" immunization<br>
regimes in which the immune response induced by administration of a priming composition<br>
is boosted by administration of a boosting composition. The present invention, in one<br>
embodiment, is based on the inventors' experimental demonstration that effective<br>
immunization can be achieved using recombinant virus, e.g., adenovirus, optionally as<br>
boosting compositions following priming with any of a variety of different types of priming<br>
compositions.<br>
A major protective component of the immune response against a number of<br>
pathogens is mediated by T lymphocytes of the CD8+ type, also known as cytotoxic T<br>
lymphocytes (CTL). An important function of CD8+ cells is secretion of gamma interferon<br>
(IFNy), and this provides a measure of CD8+ T cell immune response. A second<br>
component of the immune response is antibody directed to the proteins of the pathogen.<br>
The present invention, in one embodiment, employs recombinant virus, e.g.,<br>
adenovirus, which, as the experiments described below show, has been found to be an<br>
effective means for inducing a CD8+ T cell immune response, optionally as a boosting<br>
composition primed by antigen using any of a variety of different priming compositions,<br>
and for eliciting an antibody response.<br>
Replication-deficient adenovirus derived from human serotype 5 has been<br>
developed as a live viral vector by Graham and colleagues (Graham &amp; Prevec 1995 Mol<br>
Biotechnol 3:207-20; Bett et al. 1994 PNAS USA 91:8802-6). Adenoviruses are nbnenveloped<br>
viruses containing a linear double-stranded DNA genome of around 36 kb.<br>
Recombinant viruses can be constructed by in vitro recombination between an adenovirus<br>
genome plasmid and a shuttle vector containing the gene of interest together with a strong<br>
eukaryotic promoter, in a permissive cell line which allows viral replication. High viral<br>
titres can be obtained from the permissive cell line, but the resulting viruses, although<br>
capable of infecting a wide range of cell types, do not replicate in any cells other than the<br>
permissive line, and are therefore a safe antigen delivery system. Recombinant<br>
adenovirases have been shown to elicit protective immune responses against a number of<br>
antigens including tick-borne encephalitis virus NS1 protein (Jacobs et al. 1992 J Virol<br>
66:2086-95) and measles virus nucleoprotein (Fooks et al. 1995 Virology 210:456-65).<br>
Remarkably, the experimental work described below demonstrates that use of<br>
embodiments of the present invention allows for recombinant adenovirus expressing an<br>
antigen to induce an immune response, optionally as a boosting composition primed by a<br>
DNA vaccine. The adenovirus was found to induce an immune a CD8+ T cell and antibody<br>
response after intramuscular immunization. In prime/boost vaccination regimes the<br>
recombinant virus, e.g., adenovirus, is also envisioned as being able to prime an immune<br>
response that can be boosted by a different recombinant virus or recombinantly produced<br>
antigen.<br>
Non-human primates immunized with recombinant virus, e.g., adenovirus,<br>
optionally as a boosting composition following priming with plasmid DNA were protected<br>
against challenge. Both recombinant adenovirus and plasmid DNA are vaccines that are<br>
safe.for use in humans., Advantageously, the inventors found that a vaccination regime<br>
using single dose immunization, optionally prime and boost immunization, can be<br>
employed, constituting a general immunization regime suitable for inducing an immune<br>
response, e.g., in humans.<br>
The present invention in various aspects and embodiments employs a recombinant<br>
virus, e.g., adenovirus, encoding an antigen for inducing an immune response to the<br>
antigen, optionally for boosting an immune response primed by previous administration of<br>
the antigen or nucleic acid encoding the antigen.<br>
A general aspect of the present invention provides for the use of a recombinant<br>
virus, e.g., adenovirus, for inducing, optionally boosting an unmune response to an antigen.<br>
One aspect of the present invention provides a method of inducing, optionally<br>
boosting an immune response to an antigen in an individual, the method including<br>
provision in the individual of a recombinant virus, e.g., adenovirus, including nucleic acid<br>
encoding the antigen operably linked to regulatory sequences for production of antigen in<br>
the individual by expression from the nucleic acid, whereby an immune response to the<br>
antigen is induced or an immune response to the antigen previously primed in the<br>
individual is boosted.<br>
An immune response to an antigen may be primed by plasmid DNA immunization,<br>
by infection with an infectious agent, or by development of a recombinantly produced<br>
antigen.<br>
2-3<br>
A further aspect of the invention provides a method of inducing an immune<br>
response to an antigen in an individual, the method comprising administering to the<br>
individual a single dose of composition comprising the antigen or nucleic acid encoding the<br>
antigen or a priming composition comprising the antigen or nucleic acid encoding the<br>
antigen and then administering a boosting composition which comprises a recombinant<br>
virus, e.g., adenovirus, including nucleic acid encoding the antigen operably linked to<br>
regulatory sequences for production of antigen in the individual by expression from the<br>
nucleic acid.<br>
A further aspect provides for use of a recombinant virus, e.g., adenovirus, as<br>
disclosed, in the manufacture of a medicament for administration to a mammal to induce,<br>
optionally to boost an immune response to an antigen. Such a medicament is optionally for<br>
administration in single dose form or following prior administration of a priming<br>
composition comprising the antigen or nucleic acid encoding the antigen.<br>
The inducing, boosting, or priming composition may comprise any viral vector,<br>
including adenoviral, or other than adenoviral, such as a vaccinia virus vector such as a<br>
replication-deficient strain such as modified virus Ankara (MVA) (Mayr et al. 1978<br>
Zentralbl Bakteriol 167:375-90; Sutter and Moss 1992 PNAS USA 89:10847-51; Sutter et<br>
al. 1994 Vaccine 12:1032-40) or NYVAC (fartaglia et al. 1992 Virology 118:217-32), an.<br>
avipox vector such as fowlpox or canarypox, e.g., the strain known as ALVAC (Kanapox,<br>
Paoletti et al. 1994 Dev Biol Stand 82:65-9), a herpes virus vector, a vesicular stomatitis<br>
virus vector, or an alphavirus vector.<br>
The inducing or priming composition may comprise DNA encoding the antigen,<br>
such DNA preferably being in the form of a circular plasmid that is not capable of<br>
replicating in mammalian cells. Any selectable marker should not be resistant to an<br>
antibiotic used clinically, so for example Kanamycin resistance is preferred to Ampicillin<br>
resistance. Antigen expression should be driven by a promoter which is active in<br>
mammalian cells, for instance the cytomegalovirus immediate early (CMV IE) promoter.<br>
In particular, prime and boost embodiments of the various aspects of the present<br>
invention, administration of a priming composition is followed by boosting with a boosting<br>
composition or first and second boosting compositions, the first and second boosting<br>
compositions being the same or different from one another. Still further boosting<br>
compositions may be employed without departing from the present invention. In one<br>
embodiment, a triple immunization regime employs DNA, then adenovirus as a first<br>
boosting composition, and then MVA as a second boosting composition, optionally<br>
followed by a farther (third) boosting composition or subsequent boosting administration of<br>
one or other or both of the same or different vectors. Another option is DNA then MVA<br>
then adenovirus, optionally followed by subsequent boosting administration of one or other<br>
or both of the same or different vectors.<br>
The antigen to be included in respective priming and boosting compositions<br>
(however many boosting compositions are employed) need not be identical, but should<br>
share epitopes. The antigen may correspond to a complete antigen in a target pathogen or<br>
cell, or a fragment thereof. Peptide epitopes or artificial strings of epitopes may be<br>
employed, more efficiently cutting out unnecessary protein sequence in the antigen and<br>
encoding sequence in the vector or vectors. One or more additional epitopes may be<br>
included, for instance epitopes which are recognized by T helper cells, especially epitopes<br>
recognized in individuals of different HLA types.<br>
Within the recombinant virus, e.g., adenovirus, regulatory sequences for expression<br>
of the encoded antigen will include a promoter. By "promoter" is meant a sequence of<br>
nucleotides from which transportation may be initiated of DNA operably linked<br>
downstream (i.e., in the 3' direction on the sense strand of double-stranded DNA).<br>
"Operably linked" means joined as part of the same nucleic acid molecule, suitably<br>
positioned and oriented for transcription to be initiated from the promoter. DNA operably<br>
linked to a promoter is "under transcriptional initiation regulation" of the promoter. Other<br>
regulatory sequences including terminator fragments, polyadenylation sequences, enhancer<br>
sequences, marker genes, internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and other sequences may be<br>
included as appropriate, in accordance with the knowledge and practice of the ordinary<br>
person skilled in the art: see, for example, Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual, 2nd<br>
edition, Sambrook et al. 1989 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. Many known<br>
techniques and protocols for manipulation of nucleic acid, for example hi preparation of<br>
nucleic acid constructs, mutagenesis, sequencing, introduction of DNA into cells and gene<br>
expression, and analysis of proteins, are described in detail in Current Protocols in<br>
Molecular Biology, Ausubel et al. eds., John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1994.<br>
Suitable promoters for use in aspects and embodiments of the present invention<br>
include the cytomegalovirus immediate early (CMV IE) promoter, with or without intron A,<br>
and any other promoter that is active in mammalian cells.<br>
Adjuvants suitable for co-administration in accordance with the present invention<br>
should be ones that are potentially safe, well tolerated and effective in people including QS-<br>
21, Detox-PC, MPL-SE, MoGM-CSF, TiterMax-G, CRL-1005, GERBU, TERamide,<br>
PSC97B, Adjumer, PG-026, GSK-1, GcMAF, B-alethine, MPC-026, Adjuvax, CpG ODN,<br>
Betafectin, Alum, and MF59 (see Kim et al., 2000 Vaccine 18:597 and references therein).<br>
Other contemplated adjuvants that may be administered include lectins, growth<br>
factors, cytokines and lymphokines such as alpha-interferon, gamma interferon, platelet<br>
derived growth factor (PDGF), granulocyte-colony sthnulating factor (gCSF), granulocyte<br>
macrophage colony stimulating factor (gMCSF), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), epidermal<br>
growth factor (EOF), IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, 3L-8, IL-10, and IL-12 or encoding nucleic<br>
acids therefore.<br>
Administration of the boosting composition is generally weeks or months after<br>
administration of the priming composition, preferably about 2-3 weeks or 4 weeks, or 8<br>
weeks, or 16 weeks, or 20 weeks, or 24 weeks, or 28 weeks, or 32 weeks.<br>
Preferably, administration of single dose composition, boosting composition, or<br>
priming composition is intramuscular immunization.<br>
Intramuscular administration of adenovirus vaccines or plasmid DNA may be<br>
achieved by using a needle to inject a suspension of the virus or plasmid DNA. An<br>
alternative is the use of a needless injection device to administer a virus or plasmid DNA<br>
suspension (using, e.g., Biojector™) or a freeze-dried powder containing the vaccine (e.g.,<br>
in accordance with techniques and products of Powderject), providing for manufacturing<br>
individually prepared doses that do not need cold storage. This would be a great advantage<br>
for a vaccine that is needed in rural areas of Africa.<br>
Adenovirus is a virus with an excellent safety record hi human immunizations. The<br>
generation of recombinant viruses can be accomplished simply, and they can be<br>
manufactured reproducibly in large quantities. Intramuscular administration of<br>
recombinant adenovirus is therefore highly suitable for prophylactic or therapeutic<br>
vaccination of humans against diseases which can be controlled by an immune response.<br>
The individual may haVe a disease or disorder such that delivery of the antigen and<br>
generation of an immune response to the antigen is of benefit or has a therapeutically<br>
beneficial effect.<br>
Most likely, administration will have prophylactic aim to generate an immune<br>
response against a pathogen or disease before infection or development of symptoms.<br>
Diseases and disorders that may be treated or prevented in accordance with the<br>
present invention include those in which an immune response may play a protective or<br>
therapeutic role.<br>
Components to be administered in accordance with the present invention may be<br>
formulated in pharmaceutical compositions. These compositions may comprise a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, carrier, buffer, stabilizer or other materials well<br>
known to those skilled in the art. Such materials should be non-toxic and should not<br>
interfere with the efficacy of the active ingredient. The precise nature of the carrier or other<br>
material may depend on the route of administration, e.g., intravenous, cutaneous or<br>
subcutaneous, intramucosal (e.g., gut), intranasal, intramuscular, or intraperitoneal routes.<br>
As noted, administration is preferably intradermal, subcutaneous or intramuscular.<br>
Liquid pharmaceutical compositions generally include a liquid carrier such as water,<br>
petroleum, animal or vegetable oils, mineral oil or synthetic oil. Physiological saline<br>
solution, dextrose or other saccharide solution or glycols such as ethylene glycol, propylene<br>
glycol or polyethylene glycol may be included.<br>
For intravenous, cutaneous or subcutaneous injection, or injection at the site of<br>
affliction, the active ingredient will be in the form of a parenterally acceptable aqueous<br>
solution which is pyrogen-free and has suitable pH, isotonicity and stability. Those of<br>
relevant skill in the art are well able to prepare suitable solutions using, for example,<br>
isotonic vehicles such as Sodium Chloride Injection, Ringer's Injection, Lactated Ringer's<br>
Injection. Preservatives, stabilizers, buffers, antioxidants and/or other additives may be<br>
included, as required.<br>
A slow-release formulation may be employed.<br>
Following production of adenoviral particles and optional formulation of such<br>
particles into compositions, the particles may be administered to an individual, particularly<br>
human or other primate.<br>
Administration may be to another mammal, e.g., rodent such as mouse, rat or<br>
hamster, guinea pig, rabbit, sheep, goat, pig, horse, cow, donkey, dog or cat.<br>
Administration is preferably in a "prophylactically effective amount" or a<br>
"therapeutically effective amount" (as the case may be, although prophylaxis may be<br>
considered therapy), this being sufficient to show benefit to the individual. The actual<br>
amount administered, and rate and time-course of administration, will depend on the nature<br>
and severity of what is being treated. Prescription of treatment, e.g., decisions on dosage<br>
etc., is within the responsibility of general practitioners and other medical doctors, or in a<br>
veterinary context a veterinarian, and typically takes account of the disorder to be treated,<br>
the condition of the individual patient, the site of delivery, the method of administration and<br>
other factors known to practitioners. Examples of the techniques and protocols mentioned<br>
above can be found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 16th edition, Osol, A. ed.,<br>
1980.<br>
In one preferred regimen, DNA is administered (preferably intramuscularly) at a<br>
dose of 10 micrograms to 50 milligrams/injection, followed by adenovirus (preferably<br>
intramuscularly) at a dose of 5x10-1x10 particles/injection.<br>
The composition may, if desired, be presented in a kit, pack or dispenser, which<br>
may contain one or more unit dosage forms containing the active ingredient. The kit, for<br>
example, may comprise metal or plastic foil, such as a blister pack. The kit, pack, or<br>
dispenser may be accompanied by instructions for administration.<br>
A composition may be administered alone or in combination with other treatments,<br>
either simultaneously or sequentially dependent upon the condition to be treated.<br>
Delivery to a non-human mammal need not be for a therapeutic purpose, but may be<br>
for use in an experimental context, for instance in investigation of mechanisms of immune<br>
responses to an antigen of interest, e.g., protection against disease or pathogens.<br>
Specific Modifications of Ebola GP Optimize Vaccine Efficacy in Nonhuman Primates<br>
To develop an optimal Ebola vaccine using rAd vectors, we first analyzed mutant<br>
forms of GP in which the transmembrane domain had been removed. Though we have<br>
previously reported that deletion of the mucin domain eliminates cytotoxicity (Yang, Z.-Y.<br>
et al. 2000 Nat Med 6:886-889), this deletion removes nearly 200 amino acids, eliminating<br>
many potential T- and B-cell epitopes. Previous data suggested that the in vitro cytopathic<br>
effects of GP may be mediated at or near the cell surface and require transmembrane<br>
anchoring of the protein (Sullivan, N. J. et al. 2005 J Virol 79:547-553; Takada, A. et al.<br>
2000 Virology 278:20-26; Chan, S. Y. et al. 2000 J Gen Virol 81:2155-2159). An<br>
alternative approach to the elimination of the GP-induced cytopathic effects was therefore<br>
explored by removal of the 26 amino acid putative transmembrane and cytoplasmic<br>
domains.<br>
Diminished immune protection of a mutant GP lacking a transmembrane anchor<br>
domain<br>
GP protein was readily detected in the supernatants of cells transfected with the<br>
transmembrane-deleted vector ATM(Z), confirming its secretion, in contrast to supernatants<br>
from cells transfected with the wild type GP(Z) (Fig. 10A). Furthermore, synthesis of the<br>
two previously defined forms of GP, generated by post-translational processing (Volchkov,<br>
V. E. et al. 1995 Virology 214:421-430; Sanchez, A. et al. 1998 J Virol 72:6442-6447), was<br>
readily detected at comparable levels. Deletion of the transmembrane domain eliminated<br>
GP-induced cytopathicity in transfected 293 cells in contrast to wild type GP (Fig. 10B),<br>
but total ATM expression was equivalent to wild type protein levels (Fig. 10A). To<br>
determine whether the ATM mutant of the Zaire strain could protect against infectious<br>
Ebola challenge, cynomolgus macaques were immunized with rAd vectors encoding NP<br>
and either ATM(Z), or GP(Z). Immunization with GP(Z) + NP protected all animals<br>
vaccinated with either 1011 or 1012 adenoviral particles and challenged with 1000 pfu of the<br>
Zaire strain of Ebola virus 28 days later (Fig. 11 A), hi contrast, survival frequencies<br>
decreased in animals receiving the ATM(Z) vaccine, hi the group vaccinated with 101<br>
adenoviral particles, protective immunity was decreased by 33% and at 10U, by 66%,<br>
indicating a substantial decrease in efficacy in animals vaccinated with ATM + NP vs GP +<br>
NP (p 
against infection. Analysis of cell-mediated immune responses showed that CD4+ and<br>
CD8+ T-cell responses were present in the majority of animals by 3 weeks postimmunization<br>
(Fig. 1 IB, left and middle panels, respectively) and did not correlate with the<br>
differences in survival: antigen specific cellular responses measured by intracellular<br>
cytokine (TNF-a) secretion were indistinguishable between GP(Z)- and ATM(Z)-<br>
vaccinated animals. Similarly, humoral immune responses measured by anti-Ebola GP<br>
ELISA IgG titers were comparable in all vaccinated animals (Fig. 11B, right panel).<br>
Neutralizing antibody titers were low, and were absent in some surviving animals. These<br>
results suggested that deletion of the GP transmembrane domain reduces vaccine efficacy,<br>
with no readily apparent correlates of protection.<br>
Definition of minimal protective vaccine dose for protection with a rAd vaccine<br>
encoding GP and NP<br>
hi the previous experiment, a log decrease in dose of the GP(Z) + NP vaccine was<br>
protective, in comparison to previous studies using 1012 rAd particles. To establish the<br>
lowest dose of adenoviral vectors that would afford protection against Ebola infection, a<br>
dose-response analysis was performed. Animals were immunized with rAd vectors<br>
encoding GP(Z) and NP at increasing doses from 109 to 1012 particles per animal. Survival<br>
was 100% in all groups receiving a dose of 1010 or greater, whereas challenge infection was<br>
uniformly lethal in the 109 dose group (Fig. 12A). Virus isolation by plaque assay on Vero<br>
cells was negative for all surviving animals. Pre-challenge CD4+ T-cell responses for TNFa<br>
were unremarkable as reported previously for immunized cynomolgus macaques (Fig.<br>
12B). CD8+ T-cell responses were similar across vaccine dose groups, except for the<br>
10 higher responder immunized at 10 rAd particles. Antigen-specific IgG was also generated<br>
in immunized animals, and the levels were equivalent among animals hi the groups that<br>
survived Ebola virus challenge (Fig. 12C, left). However, there was a difference in more<br>
than one log (p=0.004) in IgG levels between survivors immunized at 1010 and fatalities<br>
immunized at 109 rAd particles, suggesting that such levels may correlate with protection<br>
for this immunization regimen. Neutralizing antibody titers against GP did not differ<br>
significantly between survivors and fatalities (Fig. 12C, right). These results indicated that<br>
the threshold for immune protection lies at about ~1010 rAd particles. Therefore,<br>
subsequent experiments were carried out using this dose to increase sensitivity to detect<br>
differences in antigenic strength between various immunogens.<br>
Identification of GP point mutants with diminished in vitro cytotoxicity that confer<br>
effective immune protection<br>
We sought to identify other mutants of GP that do not exhibit cytopathic effects yet<br>
retain native antigenic structures when expressed in vitro. Relatively conserved regions of<br>
GP were identified, and point mutations were systematically introduced. GP proteins<br>
bearing single amino acid changes were screened for decreased induction of cell rounding<br>
but wild type levels of expression and reactivity with conformation-dependent antibodies.<br>
Substitution of aspartic for glutamic acid at position 71 in Ebola GP from the Zaire or<br>
Sudan/Gulu subtypes (E71D(Z), E71D(S/G), respectively) abolished the cell rounding<br>
phenotype in transfected 293 cells but did not alter protein expression or reactivity with<br>
antibodies whose binding properties are sensitive to changes in protein conformation (Fig.<br>
14).<br>
The E71D mutants were evaluated for their ability to induce protective immunity<br>
alone or in combination with NP. When E71D from Zaire and Sudan-Gum were combined<br>
with NP, survival of cynomolgus macaques immunized in these groups was diminished by<br>
33% and 66%, respectively (Fig. 13A). In contrast, complete protection was achieved in<br>
animals immunized with E71D(Z) and E71D(S/G), as it was in animals receiving wild type<br>
GP(Z) plus NP. Ebola GP-specific responses in T-lymphocytes detected by intracellular<br>
staining of TNF-a did not show statistically significant differences in the CD4+ population<br>
between different immunization groups (Fig. 13B, left panel). Similarly, individual<br>
differences in the CD8+ response did not correlate with survival, though there was a trend<br>
toward diminished survival in groups with lower antigen-specific CD8+ cellular responses<br>
(Fig. 13B, middle panel. Antigen-specific ELISA IgG was also stimulated in all<br>
immunized animals (Fig. 13B, right panel). The results of this experiment illustrate that NP<br>
may not be necessary for protective immunity against Ebola infection and that it may<br>
diminish protection when combined with modified GP immunogens at the lower limits of<br>
protective vaccine doses.<br>
Ebola virus outbreaks are associated with high lethality due to the absence of<br>
treatment options or a licensed vaccine. Both DNA priming and rAd vector boosting, as<br>
well as rAd alone can confer protection to lethal challenge in an animal model that closely<br>
parallels human disease (Geisbert, T. W. et al. 2003 Am JPathol 163:2347-2370). The rAd<br>
vector vaccine conferred protection in an accelerated vaccine regimen in nonhuman<br>
primates (Sullivan, N. J. et al. 2003 Nature 424:681-684). Although in vitro cytopathicity<br>
has been observed by over expression of Ebola GP, one of the vaccine components, we<br>
have not seen toxicity in animals vaccinated by vectors expressing Ebola GP. However,<br>
because this hypothetical complication has been raised, we sought to modify GP to<br>
eliminate in vitro cytopathicity yet retain antigenic properties that are necessary for<br>
protective immunity. Here, the efficacies of different forms of GP were evaluated using<br>
doses at the threshold of protection in the accelerated vaccination model. We have<br>
identified a vaccine with decreased in vitro cytopathicity that retained immunogenicity<br>
necessary to protect against Ebola infection.<br>
We find that alternative forms of GP confer differential immune protection.<br>
Deletion of the GP transmembrane domain abolished cytopathic effects in transfected 293<br>
cells, but the corresponding ATM(Z) vaccine was less efficacious than wild type GP(Z) in<br>
protecting nonhuman primates against infection. Though cellular and humoral immune<br>
responses were indistinguishable between groups receiving the different immunogen forms,<br>
the inherent variability in quantitating the responses in outbred macaques may obscure our<br>
ability to identify immune responses restxmsible for higher survival. Alternatively,<br>
ATM(Z) may differ from wild type GP(Z) in antigenic qualities that are not captured by<br>
measurements of total antigen-specific IgG or intracellular cytokine responses stimulated by<br>
a broad peptide pool. For example, the transmembrane-deleted protein is secreted and<br>
likely shows conformational differences from the membrane anchored protein. Subsequent<br>
modifications of the glycoprotein to retain membrane attachment and a more native<br>
envelope structure yielded a mutant, E71D, with reduced in vitro cytopatbicity. Recently, it<br>
has been suggested that this region of GP contributes to viral receptor binding<br>
(Manicassamy, B. et al. 2005 J Virol 79:4793-4805). It is noteworthy that the envelope<br>
glycoprotein cytopathicity of other viruses such as HIV is linked to receptor binding and<br>
fusion (Cao, J. et al. 1996 J Virol 70:1340-1354), raising the possibility that Ebola GP<br>
shares similar properties.<br>
Ongoing outbreaks of both Ebola and Marburg viruses illustrate the importance of<br>
developing a filovirus vaccine for human use. This report shows that protective immunity<br>
against Ebola infection is achieved in nonhuman primates by the generation of antigenspecific<br>
immune responses to a single protein, GP, which has been modified to eliminate invitro<br>
cytopathic effects. The accelerated vaccine strategy has since been repeated using<br>
vescicular stomatitis virus (VSV) vectors (Jones S. M. et al. 2005 Nat Med, published<br>
online June 5, 2005), validating the promise of vaccines for Ebola. However, there are<br>
concerns about the use of VSV as a human vaccine because it is replication-competent and<br>
derives from a virus that is pathogenic in animals, hi contrast, the rAd vector vaccine is<br>
non-replicating, can be manufactured to high yields, and safety data exist for this platform.<br>
Immunity follows a single injection with 1010 rAd particles, a dose that is two orders of<br>
magnitude lower than previously reported for this single modality vaccine. Such doses of<br>
rAd vectors have proven to be well-tolerated and immunogenic for other recombinant genes<br>
in vivo and can be evaluated for the vectors reported here, alone or in DNA prime/rAd<br>
boost combinations. Immunization with 1010 rAd particles of E71D(Z) + E71D(S/G)was<br>
effective against infectious challenge with Ebola Zaire, and protection did not require NP.<br>
Elimination of NP from the vaccine and dose reductions to 1010 rAd particles do not<br>
dimmish protection and simplify the vaccine for future development in human trials.<br>
Example 1<br>
Vector construction and transfections<br>
El/E3-deleted, replication-incompetent Ad5 vectors were generated in PER.C6®<br>
cells (Fallaux, F. J. et al. 1998 Hum Gene Ther 9:1909-1917) using a pBR322-based<br>
adaptor plasmid pAdApt together with cosmid pWE.Ad.Aflin-rITRAE3 essentially as<br>
described elsewhere (Havenga, M. J. et al. 2001 J Virol 75:3335-3342). The adaptor<br>
plasmid contained the left portion of the Ad5 genome (nucleotides 1-454), followed by<br>
transcriptional control elements and the adaptor Ad5 DNA region (nucleotides 3511-6095<br>
in Ad5). Ebola GP encoding genes were cloned into the expression cassette in the adaptor<br>
plasmids under transcriptional control of the human full-length immediate-early CMV<br>
promoter and the SV40 polyadenylation signal. Adenoviruses containing Ebola GP,<br>
GPATM, and point mutations were generated by cotransfection of linearized pAdApt-Ebola<br>
GP plasmids together with the linearized cosmid pWE.Ad.Aflin-rITRAE3 containing the<br>
right portion of the Ad5 genome to PER.C6® cells using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen).<br>
PER.C6® cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum<br>
(GffiCO) and incubated at 37°C under humified atmosphere and 10% COj. Homologous<br>
recombination led to the generation of rAd5-Ebola GP viruses. Adenoviral vectors in crude<br>
lysates were plaque purified using limiting dilutions and agar overlays, and Ad vector<br>
clones were analyzed for presence and expression of the transgene. Positive clones were<br>
amplified for large-scale production using PER.C6® cells in 48 triple-layer 3x175 cm2<br>
flasks. Viruses were purified by standard two-step CsCl gradient ultracentrifugation and<br>
subsequently desalted and formulated by three consecutive dialysis steps into TRIS-C1 pH<br>
8.0 containing 2.5% glycerol. Purified Ad vectors were stored as single use aliquots at -<br>
80°C. Virus particle (vp) titers were determined by anion-exchange high-performance<br>
liquid chromatography based on described procedures (Shabram, P. W. et al. 1997 Hum<br>
Gene Ther 8:453-465). Lnfectivity was assessed by TCID50 using 911 cells. Ebola GP<br>
expression was assessed by infection of A549 cells followed by analysis of culture lysates<br>
on western blot. The identity of the purified vectors was confirmed by PCR. Expression<br>
vectors pi012, pGP and pATM and point mutants contain a CMV enhancer promoter that<br>
have been described previously (Sullivan, NJ. et al. 2000 Nature 408:605-609). The<br>
pATM contains a deletion from amino acid 651 to 676 and was created by digesting with<br>
BspMI/Klenow, and then fusing to TGA. The resulting plasmid also contained four extra<br>
amino acids at the C-terminus (MAAS). 293 human embryonal kidney cells were cultured<br>
in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (GIBCO). Transfections to measure<br>
protein expression and cell rounding were performed in 293 cells with 2ug DNA per well<br>
of a 6-well plate using calcium phosphate (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's<br>
instructions. Protein expression was evaluated by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot<br>
with a GP-specific antibody kindly provided by A. Sanchez.<br>
Animal study and safety<br>
Cynomolgus macaques (M. fascicularis), 3-5 years old and weighing 2-3 kg,<br>
obtained from Covance, were used for immunization and challenge experiments. The<br>
monkeys, housed singly, were anesthetized with ketamine to obtain blood specimens and to<br>
administer vaccines. In conducting this research, the investigators adhered to the Guide for<br>
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, prepared by the Institute of Laboratory Animal<br>
Resources, National Research Council (National Academy Press, Washington, D.C., 1996).<br>
The facilities are fully accredited the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of<br>
Laboratory Animal Care International. They received regular enrichment according to the<br>
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (DHEW No. NIH 86-23). Before Ebola<br>
virus challenge and to the end of each experiment, the animals were maintained in the<br>
Maximum Containment Laboratory (BSL-4) and fed and checked daily.<br>
Macaque immunization and challenge<br>
Cynomolgus macaques were injected intramuscularly with a 1.0 ml equal mixture of<br>
immungens at the doses indicated. Viral challenge was performed by inoculation of<br>
animals in the left or right caudal thigh with 0.5 ml of viral stock that contained a target<br>
dose of ~ 1000 PFU EBOV (Zaire species) at four weeks after the initial immunization. No<br>
adverse effects of the adenovirus vaccination were observed acutely. The Ebola virus used<br>
in this study was originally obtained from a fatally infected human from the former Zaire in<br>
1995 (Jahrling, P. B. et al. 1996 Arch Virol Suppl 11:135-140). Collection of serum and<br>
blood for viral load and ELISA titers was performed as previously described (Sullivan, N.J.<br>
et al. 2000 Nature 408:605-609).<br>
Flow cytoraetry and antibodies<br>
Transfected cells were collected after incubation with PBS (3 mM EDTA) and<br>
incubated with control Ig or rabbit anti-sGP/GP serum (generously provided by Dr. A.<br>
Sanchez) for 30 minutes on ice. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS containing<br>
2.5% fetal bovine serum, incubated with FTTC- or PE-conjugated secondary antibodies<br>
(Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories and Sigma, respectively) for 30 minutes on ice,<br>
followed by washing. Analysis was conducted using a Becton Dickinson 4-color Calibur<br>
flow cytometer and FlowJo analysis software (Tree Star, Inc).<br>
ELISA<br>
Nunc-Immuno Maxisorp plates (Nunc, Rochester, NY) were coated with Ebola GP<br>
from 293 cell supernatants and incubated at 4°C until use. All further incubations were<br>
carried out at room temperature. Plates were then washed six times with PBS containing<br>
Tween 20. Test sera were diluted in PBS containing Tween 20 and 1% fetal calf serum and<br>
allowed to react with the Ag-coated wells for 60 minutes. After washing plates six times,<br>
goat anti-human IgG (H+L; Chemicon, Temecula, CA) conjugated to horseradish<br>
peroxidase was used as a detection antibody. Bound IgG was detected by Sigma Fast<br>
o-Phenylenediamine Dihydrochlonde Tablet Sets (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and the<br>
optical density was determined. A panel of normal sera was run each time the assay was<br>
performed.<br>
Neutralizing antibody analysis<br>
Ebola GP(Z) pseudotyped lentiviral virions were produced as previously described<br>
(Yang, 2004 J Virol 78:5642-5650). Briefly, 293T cells were plated in 10-cm-diameter<br>
tissue culture dishes and transfected the next day by calcium phosphate reagent (Invitrogen)<br>
with pCMVAR8.2, pHR'CMV-Luc and CMV/R Ebola GP(Z) plasmid DNA. Cells were<br>
transfected overnight, washed, and replenished with fresh medium. Forty-eight hours later,<br>
supernatants containing pseudotyped virus were harvested, filtered through a 0.45-um-poresize<br>
syringe filter, and stored in aliquots at -80°C. Neutralization assays were performed on<br>
HUVECs (Cambrex CC-2517) plated in a 24 well plate 1 day prior to infection. Virus<br>
stocks were incubated at 37°C for 1 hour in the presence of serum from immunized<br>
cynomolgus macaques. The culture media was removed from the cells and replaced with<br>
the virus/serum media in the presence of polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich, 107689) at a final<br>
concentration of 5ug/mL. 72 hours post infection cells were lysed and assayed by<br>
Luciferase Assay System (Promega, E1501/E1531). Luciferase activity was determined<br>
using a Veritas Microplate Luminometer from Turner Biosystems.<br>
Intracellular cytokine analysis<br>
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from cynomolgus<br>
macaque whole blood samples by separation over Ficoll. Approximately 1 x 106 cells were<br>
stimulated in 200 ul RPMI medium (GffiCO) for 6 hours at 37°C with anti-CD28 and -<br>
CD49d antibodies, brefeldin A, and either DMSO or a pool of 15-mer peptides spanning<br>
the Ebola GP Zaire (Mayinga strain) open reading frame. The peptides were 15-mers<br>
overlapping by 11 spanning the entire Ebola glycoprotein at a final concentration of 2<br>
jag/ml. Cells were fixed and permeablized with FACS Lyse (Becton Dickinson)<br>
supplemented with Tween 20, and stained with a mixture of antibodies against lineage<br>
markers (CD3-PE, CD4-PerCP, CD8-FITC) and either TNF-APC. Samples were run on a<br>
FACS Calibur or FACS Aria and analyzed using the software FlowJo. Positive gating for<br>
lymphocytes using forward vs. side scatter was followed by CD3+/CD8" and CD3+/CD4"<br>
gating, and specific populations were further defined by anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 positivity,<br>
respectively. Cytokine positive cells were defined as a percentage within these individual<br>
lymphocyte subsets and at least 200,000 events were analyzed for each sample.<br>
