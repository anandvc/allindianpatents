				<td>[0002] This application is related to U.S. Patent Application NO 09/022,869, entitled<br>
"Bonding of Soft Biological Tissues by Passing High Frequency Electric Current<br>
Therethrough", filed February 12,1998, the contents of which are incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] The present invention is related to bonding or welding of soft tissue and, more<br>
apparatus<br>
particularly, to a system apprtus and method for controlling tissue welding.<br>
"requency (RF) electrosurgical tools are widely used in a variety of medical applications for<br>
cutting, soft tissues, hemostasis and various cauterization procedures. Currently-available<br>
electrosurgical bipolar instruments generally use two electrodes of opposite polarity, one of<br>
which is located on each of the opposite jaws of, for example, a grasper. In use, tissue is<br>
held between the electrodes and alternating RF current flows between the two electrodes,<br>
heating the tissue. When the tissue temperature reaches about 30-55 Â°C, denaturation of<br>
albumens occurs in the tissue. The denaturation of the albumens results in the "unwinding"<br>
of globular molecules of albumen and Iheir subsequent entangling which results in<br>
coagulation of the tissues. Once the tissue is treated in this way, the tissue can be cut in the<br>
welded area with no bleeding. This process is commonly referred to as bipolar coagulation.<br>
[0005] Tissue welding generally comprises bringing together edges of an incision to be<br>
bonded, compressing the tissue with a bipolar tool and heating the tissue by the RF electric<br>
current flowing through them. One of the major differences between tissue welding<br>
procedures and coagulation with the purpose of hemostasis is that tissue welding requires<br>
conditions which allow for the formation of a common albumen space between the tissue to<br>
be bonded before the beginning of albumen coagulation. If such conditions are not present,<br>
coagulation will take place without a reliable connection being"formed.<br>
[0006] Problems which can occur during the tissue welding process include thermal damage<br>
to adjacent structures, over-heating of tissue and under-coagulation. Over-heating of tissue<br>
results in delayed healing, excessive scarring, tissue charring/destruction, and in tissue<br>
sticking to the electrosurgical tool. If tissue sticks to the electrosurgical tool upon removal,<br>
the tissue can be pulled apart at the weld site, adversely affecting hemostasis and causing<br>
further injury. Under-coagulation can occur if insufficient energy has been applied to the<br>
tissue. Under-coagulation results in weak and unreliable tissue welds, and incomplete<br>
hemostasis.<br>
[0007] Precise control of the welding process while avoiding excessive thermal damage,<br>
over-heatine or under-coagulation is a difficult process. particularly when attemDtine to<br>
weld tissue of varying structure, thickness and impedance. The problem of crating a viable<br>
automatic control system is particularly important for welding whose purpose is recovery of<br>
physiological functions of the organs operated on. After hemostasis, vessels or vascularized<br>
tissue parts which have been heated typically do not recover and lose functionality.<br>
[0008] Prior attempts to automate the control of tissue coagulation have met with limited<br>
success. Attempts to avoid over-heating include the use of electrosurgical tools with built-<br>
in temperature measuring devices. Built-in temperature measuring devices are used to<br>
measure the tissue temperature, provide feedback and thereby, prevent overheating.<br>
However, use of built-in temperature sensors causes the electrosurgical tools to be<br>
cumbersome, while providing only limited or inaccurate information about the status of the<br>
inner layers of the tissue between the electrodes where a connection is potentially being<br>
formed.<br>
[0009] Several prior art references suggest various methods of using the tissue impedance<br>
and a minimum tissue impedance value to define a point when coagulation is completed and<br>
tissue heating should be discontinued. Other references suggest use of a relationship<br>
between tissue impedance and current frequency to detect a point of coagulation.<br>
[0010] The prior art methods, however, do not provide effective tissue bonding solutions for<br>
use in surgical procedures and specifically lack the ability to adapt to varying tissue types<br>
and thickness during the welding procedure.<br>
[0011] It would therefore be desirable to provide an electrosurgical system and method<br>
suitable both for tissue bonding and for hemostasis which allows for adaptation to varying<br>
tissue types, structure, thickness, and impedance without over-heating, while providing a<br>
reliable tissue connection. Such a system and method would significantly reduce the time<br>
needed for surgical procedures involving tissue welding by eliminating the need for<br>
equipment adjustment during the welding process.                        <br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0019] The present invention may be applied in a variety of medical procedures involving<br>
the joining or bonding of tissue, to produce both strong tissue welds and minimize thermal<br>
damage to surrounding tissue, that would otherwise result in delayed wound healing. The<br>
system and method of the present invention also provide for automatic adaptation and<br>
control of tissue welding and coagulation processes for tissue of varying structure, thickness<br>
and/or impedance, without the need for equipment adjustment during the welding and<br>
coagulation processes.<br>
[0020] Fig. 1 illustrates one embodiment of the apparatus 10 of the invention including a<br>
power source 100 coupled to electrodes 310 of surgical instrument 300. The power source<br>
is preferably adapted to provide RF voltage to the electrodes 310. The power source 100<br>
preferably also comprises one or more sensors for sensing the RF voltage and current<br>
between the electrodes 310. As shown inFig. I, die sensors preferably include a current<br>
sensor 130 and a voltage sensor 150. The apparatus 10 further comprises a control device<br>
200. The control device 200 preferably includes a microprocessor 210 for controlling the<br>
power source 100 to provide an RF voltage to the electrodes 310 of the surgical instrument<br>
300. Although the conirol device 200 is shown with a microprocessor, the control device<br>
200 could include anyother type of programmable device implemented as a<br>
microcontroller, digital signal processor, or as a collection of discrete logic devices .The<br>
""apparatus 10 may also include an actuation device (not shown) coupled to the control device<br>
200 for actuating control device 200 and power source 100. The apparatus 10 may also<br>
include a control panel or display (not shown) as a user interface.<br>
[0021] The control device 200 is preferably adapted to: control the power source 100 to<br>
provide the RF voltage to the electrodes 310 during a first stage; monitor the tissue<br>
impedance of tissue between the electrodes 310; determine a minimum tissue impedance<br>
value; determine a relative tissue impedance as a ratio of the measured tissue impedance and<br>
the minimum tissue impedance value; detect when the relative tissue impedance reaches a<br>
predetermined relative tissue impedance value during the first stage (the predetermined<br>
relative tissue impedance value being preset or calculated as a function of the RF voltage<br>
variation during the first stage); and control the power source to provide an RF voltage<br>
during a second stage.<br>
[0022] The control device 200 preferably controls the power source 100 to provide the RF<br>
voltage during the first stage such that the RF voltage increases at a gradually decreasing<br>
rate (e.g. a decreasing rate of increase of the RF voltage over time). In one preferred<br>
embodiment, the RF voltage increases according to the following equation:<br>
U = us*tk<br>
where U is voltage, us is a constant, t is time, and k is a constant, and where<br>
k<l. fig. shows a plot of the gradually increasing rf voltage provided during></l.>
first stage. Varying the RF voltage as described above allows for automatic adjustment of<br>
the welding process when tissue of varying thickness and/or physical properties is<br>
encountered.<br>
[0023] The control device 200 can also be designed to control the power source 100 to<br>
provide an approximation of the gradually increasing RF voltage provided during the first<br>
stage. The approximation is shown in Fig, 2 as a dashed line comprising a plurality of linear<br>
segments.<br>
[0024] The control device 200 preferably calculates tissue impedance Z as a function of<br>
time by dividing the RF voltage by the electric current, determines and stores a minimum<br>
tissue impedance value Zmin, and then calculates a relative tissue impedance z as a function<br>
of time by dividing tissue impedance Z by the minimum tissue impedance value Zmin. The<br>
control device 200 preferably uses a predetermined relative tissue impedance value or<br>
calculates a relative tissue impedance value, at which point the first stage is terminated<br>
(shown in Figs. 3, 5, and 6 as value A). The relative tissue impedance value at which the<br>
first stage is terminated, hereinafter referred to as the "predetermined" relative tissue<br>
impedance value, when calculated, is preferably calculated as a function of the RF voltage<br>
during the first stage (e.g. the greater the RF voltage, the lower the calculated,<br>
predetermined relative tissue impedance value). The predetermined relative tissue<br>
impedance value is preferably within the range of about 1-1.5. When the control device 200<br>
controls the power source 100 to provide an approximation of the RF voltage during the first<br>
stage, the predetermined relative tissue impedance value is preferably calculated or set for<br>
each segment.<br>
[0025] The control device 200 preferably also calculates the RF voltage provided during the<br>
second stage as a function of the value of the RF voltage provided during the first stage<br>
when the relative tissue impedance reaches the predetermined relative tissue impedance<br>
value. The amplitude of the RF voltage provided during the second stage is preferably<br>
between about 50 - 100% of the value of the RF voltage provided at the end of the first<br>
stage (i.e. when the relative tissue impedance reaches the predetermined relative tissue<br>
impedance value).<br>
[0026] In one preferred embodiment, illustrated in Fig. 3, the control device 200 preferably<br>
controls the power source 100 to substantially stabilize the RF voltage provided during the<br>
second stage. The duration of the second stage is preferably calculated by the control<br>
device 200 as a function of the duration of the first stage.<br>
[0027] The control device 200 preferably also controls the power source 100 to modulate<br>
the RF voltages provided during the first and second stages by pulses. The pulses are<br>
preferably square pulses and have a frequency of between about 100 Hz-60 kHz and a duty<br>
cycle of between about 10-90%. A high frequency is preferably selected to prevent cell<br>
membranes from recovering during the interval between pulses.1 The frequency of the<br>
pulses may also be varied during the first and second stages.<br>
[0028] In an alternative embodiment, illustrated in Fig. 4, the control device 200 is designed<br>
to control the power source 100 to modulate the RF voltages applied during the first and<br>
second stages as described above with pulses having a frequency of between about lOOHz-<br>
60 kHz, and further modulate the RF voltage applied during the second stage with low<br>
frequency pulses with a frequency of less than about 100 Hz. The low frequency pulses are<br>
preferably square pulses. More preferably, the control device 200 controls the power source<br>
100 to substantially stabilize the amplitude of the RF voltage applied during the second<br>
stage. The control device 200 preferably calculates the duration of the second stage as a<br>
function of the duration of the first stage.                                :<br>
[0029] The amplitude of the RF voltage applied during the second stage, shown in Fig. 4 as<br>
B, is preferably calculated as a function of the value of the RF voltage applied at the end of<br>
the first stage (shown in Fig. 4 as C).<br>
[0030] The frequency of the low frequency pulses further modulating the RF voltage during<br>
the second stage is preferably defined as a function of the duration of the first stage. More<br>
preferably, the frequency of the low frequency pulses is defined such that there are between<br>
about 5-10 pulses during the second stage.<br>
[0031] In another alternative embodiment, illustrated in Fig. 5, the control device 200<br>
controls the power source to vary the RF voltage provided during the second stage as a<br>
function of the relative tissue impedance z. Preferably, the control device 200 controls the<br>
power source 100 to provide the RF voltage during the second stage to substantially<br>
stabilize the relative tissue impedance z at a relative tissue impedance level reached at the<br>
end of the first stage (shown in Fig. 5 as A). More specifically, the control device 200 is<br>
preferably designed to control the power source 100 to vary the RF voltage provided during<br>
the second stage as a function of the relative tissue impedance z by reducing the RF voltage<br>
when the relative tissue impedance z is greater than the predetermined relative tissue<br>
impedance value and increasing the RF voltage when the relative tissue impedance z is less<br>
than the predetermined relative tissue impedance value. Alternatively, the control device<br>
200 can control the power source 100 to provide RF voltage during the second stage to vary<br>
the relative tissue impedance according to a preset program. The control device 200<br>
preferably also calculates the duration of the second stage as a function of the duration of<br>
the first stage.<br>
[0032] In another alternative embodiment illustrated in Fig. 6, the control device 200 is<br>
designed to control the power source 100 to modulate the RF voltage provided during the<br>
first and second stages with pulses having a frequency of between about 100 Hz-60 kHz,<br>
and further modulate the RF voltage provided during the second stage with low frequency<br>
pulses. The control device 200 controls the power source 100 to provide the RF voltage<br>
during the second stage to substantially stabilize the relative tissue impedance z at a relative<br>
tissue impedance level reached at the end of the first stage (shown in Fig. 6 as A).<br>
Alternatively,, the control device 200 can control the power source 100 to provide RF<br>
voltage during the second stage to vary the relative tissue impedance according to a preset<br>
program. The control device 200 preferably also calculates the duration of the second stage<br>
as a function of the duration of the first stage.<br>
[0033] In each of the above embodiments the control device 200 preferably can be set to<br>
regulate the modulation pulse frequency to within about 100 Hz - 60 kHz to provide a<br>
minimum tissue resistance. Preferably, regulatory methods known in the art of extremal<br>
systems are used. The control device 200 also preferably regulates the duty cycle of the<br>
modulation pulses during tissue welding such that energy consumption for tissue breakdown<br>
and heating is reduced or minimized. Preferably, regulatory methods known in the art of<br>
extremal self-adjusting systems are used.<br>
[0034] The control device 200 is also preferably capable of controlling the power source<br>
100 to provide modulated pulse bursts of the RF voltage to the electrodes during the<br>
intervals between welding sessions. The duration of a pulse burst is preferably within about<br>
2-15 msec. The frequency of the pulse bursts is preferably within about 3 - 15 Hz. Tissue<br>
welding is preferably actuated if the average tissue resistance of tissue between the<br>
electrodes is less than a preset value.<br>
[0035] The control device 200 is also preferably capable of calculating during welding a<br>
temperature of the electrodes, a temperature of the tissue engaged between the electrodes,<br>
and a degree of tissue coagulation, for example, using a mathematical model and based on<br>
known values of the electric current and RF voltage. The calculated values are preferably<br>
used to adjust the RF voltage increase rate during the first stage and the duration of tissue<br>
welding. Adjustment of the RF voltage increase rate and the duration of tissue welding is<br>
preferably performed using algorithms known in the art of control systems. Preferably,<br>
known tissue coagulation models are used as a model. Adjustment is preferably carried out<br>
within about +/- 15% of the set voltage increase rate and welding duration.<br>
[0036] The frequency of the low frequency pulses, when modulating the RF voltage<br>
provided during the second stage, is preferably defined as a function of the duration of the<br>
first stage. More preferably, the frequency of the low frequency pulses is defined such that<br>
there are between about 5-10 pulses during the second stage.<br>
[0037] Preferably, the control device 200 further comprises a regulatory system (not shown)<br>
for stabilizing or varying the relative tissue impedance z according to a preset program.<br>
Specifically, the regulatory system stabilizes or varies the relative tissue impedance z by<br>
varying the RF voltage by a predetermined amount, the RF voltage being varied based on<br>
the direction of change of the relative tissue impedance z.<br>
[0038] The control device 200 preferably further comprises apparatus for monitoring tissue<br>
welding, and stopping tissue welding and providing a signal to a user if the RF voltage<br>
applied during the first stage reaches a preset RF voltage level and/or if the relative tissue<br>
impedance fails to reach the predetermined relative tissue impedance value.<br>
[0039] The control device 200 preferably further comprises apparatus for monitoring tissue<br>
welding, and stopping tissue welding and providing a signal to a user when the tissue<br>
impedance reaches a short circuit impedance of the electrodes of the tissue welding tool.<br>
[0040] The control device 200 preferably further comprises apparatus for monitoring tissue<br>
welding and providing a signal to a user when tissue welding is completed at the end of the<br>
second stage. The signal is preferably provided after a time lag needed for the welded tissue<br>
to cool off.<br>
[0041] The control device 200 also preferably turns off the RF voltage and provides a<br>
corresponding signal to the user when the tissue impedance or the duration of welding<br>
exceeds threshold parameters.<br>
[0042] The control device 200 preferably further comprises a filter for filtering the tissue<br>
impedance values. The control device 200 can also be designed to control the duration of<br>
the first stage as a function of the relative tissue impedance.<br>
[0043] In one embodiment of the method for welding of biological tissue of the present<br>
invention, the method comprises: applying an RF voltage during a first stage to electrodes of<br>
a tissue welding tool; monitoring tissue impedance, and determining a minimum tissue<br>
impedance value during the first stage; determining relative tissue impedance; detecting<br>
when the relative tissue impedance reaches a predetermined relative tissue impedance value;<br>
starting a second stage when the relative tissue impedance reaches the predetermined<br>
relative tissue impedance value; calculating the duration of the second stage as a function of<br>
the duration of the first stage; and applying the RF voltage during the second stage to the<br>
electrodes of the tissue welding tool.<br>
(0044] The relative tissue impedance is preferably calculated as Hie ratio of tissue<br>
impedance to the minimum tissue impedance value. The RF voltage applied during the first<br>
stage preferably increases at a gradually decreasing rate, preferably according to the<br>
following equation:<br>
U = us*tk<br>
where U is voltage, Us is a constant, t is time, and k is a constant, and where<br>
k<l.></l.>
[0045] Monitoring tissue impedance preferably includes measuring the RF voltage and<br>
electric current between the electrodes of the tissue welding tool and calculating tissue<br>
impedance by dividing the voltage by the electric current.<br>
[0046] The predetermined relative tissue impedance value is preferably a predetermined or<br>
preset value or is determined as a function of the RF voltage applied during the first stage.<br>
The predetermined relative tissue impedance value is preferably within the range of about 1-<br>
1.5.<br>
[0047] The RF voltage applied during the second stage is preferably calculated as a function<br>
of the value of the RF voltage applied at the end of the first stage (i.e. when the relative<br>
tissue impedance reaches the predetermined relative tissue impedance value). The RF<br>
voltage applied during the second stage is preferably between about 50 - 100% of the value<br>
of the RF voltage applied at the end of the first stage.<br>
[0048] In one preferred embodiment of the method of the present invention, applying the<br>
RF voltage during the second stage comprises substantially stabilizing the RF voltage<br>
applied. Fig. 3 illustrates the method by showing a plot of the RF voltage applied during the<br>
first and second stages, the tissue impedance Z and the relative tissue impedance z. As<br>
shown in Fig. 3, the RF voltage applied during the first stage is gradually increased until the<br>
relative tissue impedance z reaches a predetermined relative tissue impedance value, shown<br>
in Fig. 3 at A. As discussed above, the predetermined relative tissue impedance value can<br>
be preset or determined as a function of the RF voltage applied during the first stage. When<br>
the relative tissue impedance reaches the predetermined relative tissue impedance value, a<br>
substantially stabilized RF voltage is applied during the second stage. The RF voltages<br>
applied during the first and second stages are preferably modulated bv pulses. The pulses<br>
preferably substantially square and have a frequency of between about 100 Hz-60 kHz and a<br>
duty cycle of between about 10-90%. The frequency of the pulses can be varied during the<br>
first and second stages.<br>
[0049] In an alternative embodiment of the method of the present invention, the RF voltages<br>
applied during the first and second stages are modulated with pulses having a frequency of<br>
between about 100 Hz-60 kHz, and the RF voltage applied during the second stage is further<br>
modulated with low frequency pulses. Fig. 4 illustrates the method, showing a plot of the<br>
RF voltage applied during the second stage modulated by low frequency pulses. Preferably,<br>
the amplitude of the RF voltage applied during the second stage is substantially stabilized at<br>
a level shown in Fig. 4 as B. The amplitude of the RF voltage is preferably calculated as a<br>
function of the value of the RF voltage applied at the end of the first stage (shown in Fig 4<br>
as C).<br>
[0050] The low frequency pulses are preferably substantially square pulses. The frequency<br>
