BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing an optically active (-) 9-fluoro-3-methyl-7-oxo-2, 3-di hydro-7H-pyrido(l, 2, 3-de] ['. , 4] -benzoxazine-6-carbC'Xylic acid derivative ("pyridobenzoxazir.e car boxy lie acid derivative") represented by the formula (I) or pharmaceutically acceptable sale thereof having an excellent  antimicrobial  activity.<br><br>
wherein,<br>
R1     represents     hydrogen     atom     or     lower   ,alkyl group  having  1  to   5  carton  atoms.<br>
Description of the Prior   Art<br>
A variety of optically active pyricobsr.zoxazine carboKylic acid derivatives have been prepared' and used as active ingredients for antibiotic agents, since the compo inds^ are known to possess h Lgher ar.t imicrobial activity and weaker toxicity than optically inactive racemic mixture (see: Drugs of the future, 17 (2) , 559-563(1592)) .<br><br>
2<br>
In general, optically active (-)pyridobenzoxazine carboxylic acid derivatives have teen prepared in the art by the following two processes: the first one comprises a step of selective hydrolysis of (±)7,8-f iuoro-2, 3-dihydro-3-acetoxymethyl-4:i- [1,4] -benzoxazine by hydrolase; and, the second one comprises a step of optical resolution of (±) 7,8~::luoro-2,3-dihydro-3-acetcxymethyl-4H-[1,4]-benzoxazine by chemical reagent(see: EP 206,283; Korean Pat. No. 60,571). However, those processes have several drawbacks as followings: 1) theoretically 50% of isomers are lost; 2) high-priced reagent for separation is used; and, 3) complicate process of 8 steps are accompanied, which is not suitable for industrial-scale trass production. To sclve the said problems, a process has been developed to prepare (-)isomer by racemizing (+)isomer obtained as a by-product during the said process (iies: Japanese Patent Publication (Hex) 10-357910).<br>
Further, processes for preparing optically active pyridobenzoxazine carboxylic acid derivatives are disclosed in U.S.Pat. Nos. 4,777,253 and 5,237,060 and Korean Pat. No. 125,115 as well. These prior arts suggest that optically active (-)pyridobenzoxazine carboxylic acid derivatives using optically active (L)-alaninol can be prepared without Dptical resolution, which is.represented as the following reaction scheme:<br><br>
As shown in the scheme above, a starting material of 4r5-difluorobenzoic acid deri/ative should be employed in the reaction, since f .uorine atom among various halogen atoms is essentiall-.' required for t-.hp<br><br>
3<br>
last step of substituting proper piperazine for 10-halogen atom. Though this process is improved in a sense that optical- resolution step is not necessary, it has revealed a critical demerit that very expensive 4, 5-difiusrobenzoic acid derivative is required. On the other hand, it has been reported that relatively inexpensive 4-chloro-5-fluorobenzoic acid derivative, whose reactivity is lowered than 4,5-difluorobenzoic acid derivative, leads to substitution reac-ion at 9-f iuor.Lne atom rather than 10-fluorine atom in the last step(see: Chem. Pharm. Bull., 32, 4907-4913(1984)}.<br>
Therefore, there are strong reasons for exploring and developing a process for preparing optically active (-)pyridobenzoxazine carboxylic acid derivative by employing a low-priced material in a simple and economical manner.<br>
The present inventors su':cessf uly prepared optically active (-)pyridobenzoxazine carboxylic acid derivative, by employing a starting n.aterial of ( + )ethyl 2- (4-chloro-5-f luoro-2-halo-3-nitoben::oyl) -3- [ (1-hydroxypropy-2(S)-yl)amino]acrylate uhich is obtainable from -low-priced 4-chloro-5-fluorobenzoic acid derivative instead of high-priced 4,5-difluorobenzoic acid derivative, and substituting piperazir.e -for chlorine atom.<br>
A primary object of the pre sent invention is, therefore, to provide a process for preparing optically active (-)pyridobenzoxazine carboxylic acid derivatives.<br>
The other object of the invention is to provide novel compounds which are available ;is intermediates in the coarse of preparing the (-) pyridobenzoxazine carboxylic acid derivatives.<br><br>
