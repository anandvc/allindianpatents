The present invention relates to 13-(N-Boc-ß-isobutylserinyl)-14 ß-hydroxybaccatine V I, 14 of formula<br>
 (i)<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
having alpha-configuration of the hydroxyl group at the 7-position<br>
The present invention also relates to Pharmaceutical compositions containing compound of formula (I) as claimed in claim I which comprises; 150mg of compound of formula (I), 1100mg of polysorbate 80, 3 mg of anhydrous citric acid and dehydrated alcohol; and<br>
150mg of compound of formula (I), 550mg of polysorbate 80, 350 mg of polyethylene glycol 300 and anhydrous citric acid<br>
The following examples illustrate the invention is greater detail.<br>
Example I: Synthesis of 13-(N-Boc-ß-isobutylserinyl)-14ß-hydroxybaccatine III, I, 14 carbonate<br>
43.26 g of 14ß-hydroxy-deacetylbaccatine III together with 22.3 ml of N-methyl-imidazole were<br>
dissolved in 230 ml of DMF in a 500 ml glass round-bottom flask; this solution was added under strong<br>
stirring at room temperature in Ih with 14 ml of triethylchlorosilane. When the reaction was over, the<br>
reaction mixture was poured into 2L of water under strong stirring. An abundant precipitate formed,<br>
which was left at 4°C overnight. The precipitate was then filtered, thoroughly washing with water and<br>
subsequently with n-hexane. After drying under vacuum 48.1 g of 7-Tes-10-deacetylbaccatine III (XII)<br>
were obtained containing a small percentage of the 7,10-derivative, having the following chemical-physical<br>
characteristics:	<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
1H NMR (CDCI3 200 MHz): δ (ppm) = 0.55 (6H, t, J = 7.8 Hz, 7-OTES CH2, 0.94 (9H, q, J = 7.8 Hz, 7-OTESCH3), 1.18<br>
The present invention relates to a novel taxane useful as chemotherapeutic agent, the pharmaceutical compositions containing it and a process for the preparation of I4-ß-hydroxy-l,l4-carbonate-baccatine III and V derivatives, substituted at the 13 position by an isoserine residue.<br>
Taxanes are one of the most important classes of anticancer drugs recently developed. The remarkable effectiveness of Paclitaxel and of its analogues Docetaxel in the treatment of several tumors has focused research on substances with antimicrotubular activity. Taxanes are however characterized by a particular action mechanism, in that they promote the assembly of microtubules and inhibit tubuline depolymerization.<br>
The main drawbacks of the taxanes presently used are; (a) insolubility in water, making mandaoty the use of specific carriers which can cause hypersensitization reactions, (b) toxicities which limit dosage, (c) development of resistance mechanisms. Cell resistance to taxanes has been related to the MDR phenotype ("multidrug resistance") mediated by the P-glycoprotein transporter, by tubuline alternations, and by changes in the expression of apoptotic regulatory proteins.<br>
In order to find novel active molecules having higher solubility and better tolerability, I4ß-hydroxy-10-deacetylbaccatine III and V taxane derivatives have been synthesized.<br>
Some derivatives of 14-hydroxy baccatine III substituted at the 13-position by isoserine residues are disclosed in US 5,705,508, together with a process for the preparation thereof.<br>
It has now been found that the compound of formula<br>
deacetylbaccatine III or V into the derivative<br>
triethylsilylated at the 7- position;<br>
b)	preparation of the 1,14 carbonate derivative from the product of step (a);<br>
c)	selective acetylation of the 10- hydroxyl;<br>
d)	reaction of the product of step (c) with (4S, 5R)-N-Boc-2-(2,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-isobutyl-l-oxazolidine-5-carboxylic acid;<br>
e)	cleavage of the triethylsilyl and dimethoxybenzylidene protective groups from the product of step (d).<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of process (A) , triethylchlorosilane is used as silylating agent in step (a), whereas the 1,14 carbonate derivative in step (b) is prepared using phosgene in toluene in a 3:1 methylene chloride/pyridine solution under nitrogen atmosphere. In the following step (c) 14-↓-hydroxy-10-deacetylbaccatine III or V 7-Tes-l,14-carbonate is salified with LiHMDS in anhydrous THF, thereby obtaining the 10-hydroxy derivative lithium salt, which is subsequently acetylated with acetyl chloride. The condensation reaction between 14-↓-hydroxy-7-Tes-l,14-carbonate-baccatine III or V and (4S, 5R)-N-Boc-2-(2,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-isobutyl-l-oxazolidine-5-carboxylic acid (step (d) ) is carried out in anhydrous apolar organic solvent, in the presence of a base and a condensing agent such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC).<br>
Finally, in step (e) triethylsilyl is removed with pyridinium fluoride in acetonitrile/pyridine solution under nitrogen, whereas the dimethoxybenzylidene group is removed in methylene chloride solvent by addition of methanol HC1 and subsequently of NaHCO3.<br>
The step sequence of the process described can be inverted thus obtaining the final product in as much comparable yields. Said alternative process (B) comprises<br>
the following steps:<br>
a')  selective acetylation of the hydroxyl at C-10 of<br>
14S-hydroxy-10-deacetylbaccatine III or V; b')  preparation of the 1,14 carbonate derivative from<br>
the product of step (a') c1)  silylation of the hydroxyl at C-7; d')  reaction of the product of step (C) with (4S,<br>
5R) -N-Boc-2- (2,4-dimethoxyphenyl) -4-isobutyl-l-<br>
oxazolidine-5-carboxylic acid;<br>
e')  cleavage    of     the    triethylsilyl    and<br>
* dimethoxybenzylidene protective groups from the<br>
product of step (d').<br>
The latter process involves a number of advantages such as the possibility to obtain the desired synton (1,14-carbonate-7-Tes-baccatine III or V) without chromatographic purifications, merely by crystallization.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the selective acetylation of step (a1) is carried out with acetic anhydride in the presence of cerium, scandium, ytterbium salts, preferably CeCl3.7H20, whereas the remaining steps are carried out as indicated above.<br>
The present invention also comprises, as intermediate products of the process for the preparation of 14S-hydroxy-1,14-carbonate baccatine III or V, the following compounds: 14S-hydroxy baccatine III or V, 14S-hydroxy baccatine III or V 1,14 carbonate, 14-S-hydroxy-7-Tes-10-deacetylbaccatine III or V, 14-S-hydroxy-7-Tes-baccatine III or V, 14-S-hydroxy-7-Tes-baccatine III or V 1,14-carbonate.<br>
A further aspect of the invention relates to a process for   the   preparation   of    (4S,    5R)-N-Boc-2-(2, 4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4 -isobutyl-1-oxazolidine-5 -carboxylic acid, according to the following scheme:<br>
SCHEME<br>
(Scheme Removed)  <br>
Said process comprises the following steps:<br>
a)	protection of the amino group of leucinol-1 with Boc;<br>
b)	transformation of N-Boc-L-leucinol into N-Boc-L-leucinal;<br>
c)	preparation of the cyanhydrin of the product from step (b) ;<br>
d)	transformation of the cyanhydrin nitrile into the corresponding carboxylic acid;<br>
e)	formation of the carboxylic acid methyl ester;<br>
f)	purification of the  (2R,  3S)-3-(N-Boc)amino-2-hydroxy-5-methylhexanoic acid methyl ester,-<br>
g)	condensation of the product of step (f) with 2,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde dimethyl acetal;<br>
h)   transformation  of  the  (4S,  5R) -N-Boc-2- (2,4-<br>
dimethoxyphenyl)-4 -isobutyl-1-oxazolidine-5-<br>
carboxylic   acid   methyl   ester   into   the<br>
corresponding carboxylic acid.<br>
According to  a preferred embodiment,  in step  (a)<br>
leucinol is reacted with Boc-anhydride, and subsequently<br>
oxidized to aldehyde in DMSO/CH2C12 solvent using oxalyl<br>
chloride at a temperature below -60°C,  neutralizing the<br>
formed acid with triethylamine, or oxidizing it with sodium<br>
hypochlorite at -2 to -5°C. The cyanhydrin of step (c) is<br>
prepared  by  substituting  the  sulfonic  group  of  the<br>
intermediate	l-hydroxy-2-(N-Boc)amino-4-<br>
methylpentanesulfonate by the cyanide ion. The cyanhydrin is then hydrolyzed to the corresponding carboxylic acid in step (d) by refluxing in concentrated hydrochloric acid.<br>
In step (e) , (2R/S,3S)-3-(N-Boc)amino-2-hydroxy-5-methylhexanoic acid is converted in the corresponding methyl ester by reaction with diazomethane in ethereal solution. In step (f) , diastereomer (2R, 3S) is purified by crystallization  from  cyclohexane  or  an  hexane/toluene<br>
mixture. Step (g) is carried out in THF in the presence of<br>
pyridinium  p-toluenesulfonate  removing  the  developed<br>
methanol; after completion of the reaction, pyridinium p-<br>
toluenesulfonate is neutralized with bicarbonate. In step<br>
(h) , the ester is hydrolysed in a methanol/water mixture<br>
with  potassium  carbonate.  The  reaction  mixture  is<br>
subsequently acidified and the final product is extracted<br>
with methylene chloride.<br>
The invention also comprises (4S, 5R)-N-Boc-2-(2,4-dimethoxyphenyl) -4-isobutyl-l-oxazolidine-5-carboxylic acid as an intermediate for the synthesis of baccatine III and V derivatives substituted at the 13- position by a N-Boc-S-isobutylserinyl residue.<br>
The novel taxane of the present invention showed a strong anticancer activity against cancerous cells of breast, lung, ovary, colon, prostate, kidney, pancreas, and also against cells resistant to the known anticancer drugs such as adriamycin, vinblastine and platinum derivatives.<br>
Therefore, the invention relates to pharmaceutical formulations containing an effective amount of the compound of the invention, together with pharmacologically acceptable carriers and excipients. More particularly, the compound can be formulated in the form of tablets, powders, granulates, capsules, injectables, solutions, suppositories, emulsions, dispersions, and the like. For the intravenous administration, mixtures of Chremophor L and ethanol, polysorbate and ethanol or liposome formulations prepared with natural or synthetic phosphatidylcholine, or mixtures of natural phospholipids in the presence of cholesterol are mainly used; for the oral administration, soft-gelatin capsules in which the product is solubilised in polysorbates, PEG or mixtures thereof, optionally in the presence of phospholipids, are preferably prepared. Compound (I) can be administered to<br>
humans at concentrations from 50 to 500 mg/m2.<br>

Example 3: Preparation of (4S, 5R)-N-Boc-(2 , 4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-isobutvl-l-oxazolidine-5-carboxylic acid<br>
Preparation of N-Boc-L-leucinol (III) :<br>
46.8 g of L-leucinol II (400 mmol) were dissolved in 300 ml of CH2Cl2 in a 21 three-necked round-bottom flask equipped with mechanical stirrer, thermometer and dropping funnel. The stirred solution was then added drop by drop at room temperature with the solution of Boc anhydride (87.2 g, 400 mmol) in CH2C12 (100 mL) in 90 minutes. During the addition of the first 25% of Boc-anhydride, the reaction was exothermic and it reached 20-30°C yielding a slurry which turned clear after stirring at room temperature for a further three hours. The whole was left at room temperature overnight. The solvent was evaporated under high vacuum to obtain the desired product as a thick oil in a quantitative yield (87 g) . The product was subsequently treated without further purifications.<br>
Preparation of N-Boc-L-leucinal (IV)<br>
A solution of oxalyl chloride (26.274 mL, 300 mmol) in 130 ml of methylene chloride precooled' at -60/-65°C was slowly added with DMSO (28.4 mL, 400 mmol).<br>
The solution turned clear when the addition of DMSO was completed. After 20 minute stirring at the same temperature the reaction mixture was subsequently treated with a solution of alcohol III (43.7 g, 200 mmol) in CH2C12 (200 mL) for 25 min. keeping temperature below -60°C. During the addition of the alcohol the reaction mixture<br><br>
19 became cloudy, and a white precipitate formed. After 20-25<br>
minutes of stirring at the same temperature a solution of<br>
triethylamine  (112 mL,  800 mmol)  in CH2Cl2  (100 mL) was<br>
added dropwise in 40 minutes keeping temperature between -<br>
68 and -62 °C. The reaction mixture was then stirred at<br>
between -60 and -65°C for a further 50 minutes. TLC of the<br>
reaction mixture carried out using 8% methanol in CH2Cl2 as<br>
eluent detected no starting product.<br>
The cold solution was then poured into 800 ml of an iced solution containing 68 g (0.5 mol) of KHSO4. The organic layer was separated and the aqueous phase extracted with CH2C12_ (100 mL) . The combined organic phases were washed with aqueous KHSO4 (5%, 1x200 mL) , brine (100 mL, 50 mL) and concentrated to half volume (-2 50 mL) . Said material was used directly in the subsequent step.<br>
Aldehyde (V) bisulfite compound derivative<br>
The methylene chloride solution of the aldehyde (IV) in a 21 three-necked round-bottom flask equipped with mechanical stirrer, thermometer and dropping funnel was treated in 10 minutes and at -5°C with a sodium solution bisulfite (41.7 g, 400 mmol) in water (200 mL) and subsequently with n-Bu4NHSO4 (678 mg, 2 mmol). The solution was cooled to -5°C. The reaction mixture was stirred at -5 to -0°C for 5-6 hours and subsequently overnight at room temperature. The aqueous phase containing compound V was separated and washed with CH2Cl2 (2 x 20 mL).<br>
(2-Cvano-3-(N-Boc)-amino-5-methvl-hexanol (VI)<br>
The above aqueous solution (-250 mL) was added with CH2Cl2 (120 mL) and the reaction mixture was cooled to 0-5°C on an ice bath. Solid KCN (15 g, 230 mmol) was subsequently added to the reaction mixture and the solution was stirred at room temperature overnight. The organic phase was separated and the aqueous phase was extracted with CH2Cl2. The combined organic phases were washed with<br><br>
brine (1x50 mL), dried over MgSO4 and evaporated to obtain<br>
the product as a colourless viscous liquid (43 g) The<br>
product had [α]D 51.11  (c=2, MeOH) and was an about 2:1<br>
mixture of the VI 2(R),3(S) and 2(S),3(S) derivatives. The<br>
yield was 89% compared with the starting L-leucinol.<br>
(2RS,3S)-3-Amino-2-hydroxy-5-methylhexanoic acid (VII)<br>
The mixture of the above crude nitrile VI (43 g) was treated with 150 ml of concentrated HCl (37%) (150 mL) and refluxed overnight to give the crude acid VII*. The hydrochloric acid excess was removed by rotatory evaporator and the residue was evaporated with water (100 mL) to remove HCl. The residue was then dissolved in 150 ml of water and added with 100 ml of acetone, then treated with 33 ml of a 6.25M NaOH solution to adjust pH to 5. A further amount of acetone (500 mL) was then added to the solution which was left to stand overnight at 4°C. The precipitated solid was subsequently filtered and the solid cake was washed with acetone and dried under vacuum to give crude acid VII (6.5 g) containing an about 3:1 mixture of 2(R),3(S) and 2(S),3(S) derivatives of compound VI.<br>
The filtrate was evaporated and water was added to adjust the volume of the solution to 75 mL.<br>
Acetone (1 L) was then added to the solution which was left to stand overnight at 4°C in refrigerator. The precipitated solid was then filtered and the solid cake was washed with acetone and dried under vacuum to give a second amount of product (18 g) containing sal id NaCl with an about 1:1 mixture of 2(R),3(S) and 2(S),3(S) derivatives of VII.<br>
The first product VII recovered (22.5 g) was heated in water (120 mL) without obtaining a complete dissolution and then cooled in ice and filtered to obtain 12.5 g of acid VII still contaminated by about 10% of undesired 2(R),3(S) derivative of VII. This product was dried and mixed with<br>
the   above   1:1   mixture   of   the   second   crop   crystals    (total<br>
-27   g).<br>
(2RS, 3S) -3- (N-Boc) Amino-2-hydroxy-5-methylhexanoic<br>
acid   (VIII)<br>
(A)	The crude acid VI 2(R),3(S), about 90% purity,<br>
(2.5 g,  77.6 mmol)  was dissolved in a water - THF 1:1<br>
mixture (80 mL) , then triethylamine (13.5 mL) and subsequently Boc anhydride (18.5 g, 85 mmol) were added to the reaction mixture, the whole solution was stirred for 40 hours at room temperature. The solvent was evaporated by rotatory evaporator, 60 ml of water and 6 0 ml of ethyl acetate were added keeping the whole under stirring. The aqueous phase was separated and extracted with ethyl acetate (30 mL). The combined organic phases were extracted with 10% aqueous sodium carbonate (30 mL, 20 mL) . The basic extract was then combined with an aqueous phase acidified with 2M hydrochloric acid (-55 mL) to adjust pH of the solution to 2. Acid VIII was then extracted from the aqueous phase with ethyl acetate (3x4 0 mL) and the heteroacetic extracts were washed with water (20 mL) , dried (MgSO4) and evaporated to give the crude VIII Boc derivative as syrup (20 g, 99%).<br>
(B)	The crude acid VII 2R,3S, with purity of about<br>
50%, contaminated by NaCl (27 g) , was dissolved in a water<br>
- dioxane 1:1 mixture (120 mL) . Triethylamine (20 mL) was<br>
then added to the reaction mixture, then Boc anhydride<br>
(26.16 g, 120 mmol). The solution was stirred for 40 hours<br>
at room temperature. The solvent was evaporated by rotatory<br>
evaporator and water (100 mL) and ethyl acetate (100 mL)<br>
were added to the residue keeping stirring for a further<br>
few minutes. The organic phase was separated and extracted<br>
with 10% aqueous sodium carbonate (45 mL, 3 0 mL) . The<br>
sodium carbonate extracts were then combined with the<br>
aqueous phase, acidified with 1M hydrochloric acid (-165<br>
mL) and extracted with ethyl acetate (3x60 mL) , afterwards<br>
washed with water (30 mL) , dried (MgSO4) and evaporated to<br>
give the crude VII Boc as syrup (16 g) , consisting of a 1:1<br>
mixture of the 2R,3S and 2S,3S isomers.<br>
(2R,3S)-3-(N-Boc)Amino-2-hydroxy-5-methylhexanoic acid<br>
methyl ester (IX)<br>
Diazomethane was prepared from diazald following the<br>
process reported in T.H. Black [Aldrichimica Acta, 16, 3<br>
(1983)] .<br>
(A)	A solution of the crude acid VIII (20 g, 56.6 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (75 mL) was slowly added to a cold diazomethane ethereal solution (-77 mmol) and the mixture was left for two hours on ice bath. The colour of the solution in that step turned white thus indicating that most diazomethane had been adsorbed. The solution was then concentrated and the residue crystallized from a mixture of toluene (20 mL) and hexane (70 mL) . After cooling overnight in refrigerator at 4°C, the crystals of the pure IXA 2R,3S derivative were collected by filtration. The yield was 15 g. The mother liquors gave about 5 g of a 1:1 isomeric mixture.<br>
(B)	Using the same procedure, a 1:1 mixture of acid VIII (16 g) was transformed into a 1:1 mixture of IXA and IXB esters . The material from mother liquors (5 g from step A) was added and the material was combined and separated by column chromatography using hexane-ethyl acetate as eluent (9:1 to 7:3). Ninhydrine was used as developer for the TLC plates. The apolar compound, Rf 0.75<br>
(hexanoethyl acetate : 7:3) was identified as the desired ester IXA (2R,3S), which was recrystallized from cyclohexane to give IXA as colorless needles (8 g) m.p. 95-96°C, [α]D 72,4° (c=l, MeOH).<br>
The polar compound, Rf 0.5 (hexane-ethyl acetate 7:3) was identified as IXB (2S,3S), and was recrystallized from<br>
cyclohexane to give 10 g of IXB as colorless needles.<br>
2,4-dimethoxybenzaldehydedimethyl acetal<br>
A mixture of 2,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde (41.25 g, 0.2 5 mols), anhydrous trimethyl orthoformate (50 mL) and ammonium nitrate (2 g dissolved in 20 ml of methanol) was refluxed for 6 hours (1HNMR of the reaction mixture showed a 65-70% conversion). At first, the hot reaction mixture was a clear solution, but as the reaction progressed the solid precipitated. A second portion of anhydrous trimethyl orthoformate (20 mL) was added and part of methanol was distilled off.<br>
When the temperature of the reaction mixture reached 95-100°C, all the solid dissolved in the flask. The solution was cooled to room temperature and added with anhydrous Na2CO2 (5 g), stirring for 3 0 min. Subsequently the solution was filtered and the residue was distilled by fractional distillation under vacuum at 0.25 mmHg. The first fraction at low temperature mainly consisted of the trimethyl orthoformate excess and the second fraction, which distilled as colourless oil at 175-180°C, was the desired acetal. Yield: 37 g (70%).<br>
(4S,5R)-N-Boc-2-(2,4-Dimethoxyphenyl)-4-isobutyl-l-oxazolidine-5-carboxylic acid methyl ester (X)<br>
A solution of (2R, 3S) -3- (N-Boc) amino-2-hydroxy-5-methylhexanoic acid methyl ester (IXA) (34.375 g, 125 mmol) in anhydrous THF (150 ml) was added with distilled 2,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde dimethyl acetal (30 g, 142 mmol) and subsequently pyridinium p-toluenesulfonate (Py.Tos; 400 mg) .<br>
The solution was heated under mild reflux in a 500 ml three-necked flask equipped with a Dean-Stark separator. After about 6 hours under reflux, about 60 ml of THF containing methanol generated during the reaction were removed. A sample was taken for 1H NMR analysis (in CDCl3) .<br>
The peak at δ   = 1.41 ppm disappeared (1) and a novel peak<br>
appeared at δ    = 1.24 ppm for the protected methyl 'ester<br>
(2). After 6 hour reflux, the conversion was about 70-75%.<br>
A fresh aliquot of anhydrous THF (50 ml) was added, then an amount of 2,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde acetal (5,0 g; 24 mmol). The reaction mixture was refluxed for a further 2.5 hours, during which time about 50 ml of THF were removed using the Dean-Stark apparatus. The subsequent H NMR analysis showed the complete transformation of the starting material.<br>
The reaction mixture was added with a NaHCO3 saturated aqueous solution (15 ml) and the mixture was stirred for 15 minutes to neutralize Py.Tos. t-Butyl methyl ether (85 ml) and water (15 ml) were subsequently added and the organic phase was separated. The aqueous phase was extracted with t-butyl methyl ether (2 0 ml) and the combined organic phases were washed with water (30 ml) and evaporated to a residue (66 g) of crude product X.<br>
Hydrolysis of ester X to give acid XI<br>
The crude ester X (22 g, 42 mmol) was dissolved in 100 ml of methanol and added with water (50 ml) containing 8.7 g of potassium carbonate. After stirring overnight at room temperature, the reaction was considered completed by TLC monitoring (toluene-ethyl acetate: 4.5:1). TLC analysis was confirmed by H NMR analysis, checking the disappearance of the methyl ester peak.<br>
Methanol was evaporated at a temperature not above 40°C under vacuum (about 60 g residue) and water (150 ml) was added to the residue. The aqueous suspension was extracted with ethyl acetate (5x50 ml) to remove the benzaldehyde and benzaldehyde dimethyl acetal excess. 90 ml of methylene chloride were added to the aqueous phase, the mixture was cooled on ice bath and the diphasic system was treated with about 125 ml of 1M NaHSO4  (pH = 3) under<br>
strong stirring. The phases were separated and the aqueous<br>
phase was extracted with methylene chloride (75 ml-) . The<br>
combined methylene chloride extracts were washed with water<br>
(30 ml), brine (30 ml) and dried over MgSO4. The solution<br>
was then kept at -60°C until next use. The yield in the<br>
final product as colourless solid was of 16 g, about 93%<br>
based on the starting product.<br>

A solution of 11.2 g of 10-deacetyl-14-hydroxybaccatine III in 50 ml of dry tetrahydrofuran was added with 0.72 g of CeCl3. 7H2O and 7.3 ml of acetic anhydride. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 5 hours; during this time the mixture became homogeneous. 10 g of ice were added and the whole was stirred for 1 hour. Tetrahydrofuran was evaporated off under vacuum and the residue was diluted with 200 ml of H2O.

In a four-necked flask equipped with stirrer, dropping funnel, thermometer and reflux condenser cooled to -12°C, were placed 52.8 ml of a 1. 9M solution of phosgene in<br>
toluene. This solution was dropwise added with 11.6 g of<br>
14-hydroxy baccatine III dissolved in 53 ml of methylene<br>
chloride and 17.5 ml of pyridine under stirring in 30<br>
minutes. Temperature was kept between -6 and -10°C. After<br>
30 minutes 50 ml of NaHCO3 saturated solution were added<br>
under stirring keeping a tight control of the temperature.<br>
After  warming  to  room  temperature,  the  phases  were<br>
separated.  The  aqueous  phase  was  contraextracted with<br>
methylene chloride and the organic phases were washed with<br>
45 ml of 2N HCl adjusting pH to about 1. The organic phase<br>
was washed with 0. 1N HCl and then with NaHCO3, then dried<br>
over Na2SO4 and evaporated to dryness to quantitatively<br>
obtain 11.5 g of 14-hydroxybaccatine-l,14 carbonate.<br>
11.5 g of 14-hydroxybaccatine-l,14 carbonate were dissolved in 50 ml of DMF and 1.1 equivalents of chlorotriethylsilane and 3 equivalents of N-methyl-imidazole were added at room temperature. After completion of the reaction, the mixture was poured into 500 ml of H2O and the precipitate was filtered and washed thoroughly with H20, then dried to obtain 12.8 g of 14ß-hydroxy-7-Tes-baccatine 111-1,14 carbonate with the same characteristics as those reported in example 1.<br>
Example 5: Synthesis of 13-(N-Boc-ß-isobutylserinvl)-14ß-hvdroxybaccatine III, 1,14 carbonate<br>
