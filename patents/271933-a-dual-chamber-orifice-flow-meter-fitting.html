STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED<br>
RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT<br>
Not applicable.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to methods and apparatus for monitoring characteristics of a flow stream in a pipeline, in particular to dual chamber orifice fittings. More precisely, the embodiments of the invention relate to an improved valve design for a dual chamber orifice fitting.<br>
In pipeline operations and other industrial applications, flow meters are used to measure the volumetric flow rate of a gaseous or liquid flow stream moving through a piping section. Flow meters are available in many different forms. One type of flow meter is an orifice meter, which includes an orifice fitting connected to the piping section. The orifice fitting serves to orient and support an orifice plate that extends across the piping section perpendicular to the direction of flow stream. The orifice plate is a thin plate that includes a circular opening, or orifice, that is positioned within the flow stream.<br>
In operation, when the flow stream moving through the piping section reaches the orifice plate, the flow is forced through the orifice, thereby constricting the cross-sectional area of the flow. Due to the principles of continuity and conservation of energy, the velocity of the flow increases as the stream moves through the orifice. This velocity increase creates a pressure differential across the orifice plate. The measured differential pressure across the orifice plate can be used to calculate the volumetric flow rate of the flow stream moving through the piping section.<br>
A dual chamber orifice fitting enables the orifice plate to be removed from the fitting without interrupting the flow stream moving through the piping section. In many designs, this is achieved by providing two chambers within the fitting wherein the orifice plate is in the flow stream in one chamber and out of the flow stream in the second chamber. An isolation valve is provided between the two chambers so as to prevent fluid communication between the two chambers but can be opened to allow the orifice plate to pass therethrough.<br>
Valve designs that are more compact and require less movement for actuation potentially provide advantages both in reduced operating envelope requirements and in simplification of operation.   Thus, the embodiments of the present invention are directed to valve apparatus for dual chamber orifice fittings that seek to overcome these and other limitations of the prior art. SUMMARY OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Embodiments of the present invention include dual chamber orifice fittings and methods for constructing and operating dual chamber orifice fittings. A dual chamber orifice fitting comprises a body having a lower chamber and a top having an upper chamber. An aperture connects the upper<br>
chamber to the lower chamber. A closure member is pivotally mounted to the fitting and pivots about a first axis between a first position and a second position. A pivot arm is rotatably mounted to the body and engages the closure member so that rotation of the pivot arm about a second axis pivots the closure member about the first axis between the first and second positions.<br>
In certain embodiments, an isolation valve assembly comprises an operational shaft that is rotatably coupled to a body and rotates about a first axis. A pivot arm is rotatably coupled to the operational shaft. A closure member coupled to the pivot arm and pivotally mounted to the body. Rotation of the operational shaft about the first axis pivots the closure member about a second axis.<br>
Thus, the embodiments of present invention comprise a combination of features and advantages that enable substantial enhancement of the operation of dual chamber orifice fittings. These and various other characteristics and advantages of the present invention will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments of the invention and by referring to the accompanying drawings.<br>

In the description that follows, like parts are marked throughout the specification and drawings with the same reference numerals, respectively. The drawing figures are not necessarily to scale.   Certain features of the invention may be shown exaggerated in scale or in somewhat<br>
schematic form and some details of conventional elements may not be shown in the interest of clarity and conciseness.<br>
Referring now to Figure 1, dual chamber orifice fitting 12 includes body 16 and top 18. Body 16 encloses lower chamber 20 which is in fluid communication with the interior 34 of a pipeline. Top 18 encloses upper chamber 22 and is connected to body 16 by connection members 17. Aperture 30 defines an opening connecting upper chamber 22 to lower chamber 20. Isolation valve assembly 24 is mounted within body 16 and is actuatable so as to selectively close aperture 30. Lower drive 36 and upper drive 38 operate to move orifice plate carrier 32 vertically within fitting 12. Once in the upper chamber 22, orifice plate carrier 32 can be removed from fitting 12 by loosening clamping bar screws 46 and removing clamping bar 44 and sealing bar 40 from top 18.<br>
Isolation valve assembly 24 is shown in Figures 1 and 2 in the closed position. Isolation valve assembly comprises operational shafts 50, pivot arm 52, closure member 54, and preload biasing members 56. Operational shafts 50 rotatably couple to each side of pivot arm 52 so that the shafts and the pivot arm rotate together. Pivot arm 52 comprises pins 58 that slidably engage with slot 60 on closure member 54 and position the closure member in sealing engagement across aperture 30. Closure member 54 comprises hinge pins 62 that pivotally mount the closure member to either body 16 or top 18 (not shown). Hinge pins 62 support closure member 54 in the open position and when rotating. Hinge pins 62 are loosely contained in body 46 so as to allow movement of closure member 54 and ensure proper sealing engagement of closure member across aperture 30.<br>
Figures 1 and 2 show orifice plate carrier 32 in a metering position in alignment with bore 34. Isolation valve assembly 24 is in a closed position, so that closure member 54 is sealingly engaged across aperture 30. Biasing members 56 are also mounted within body 16 and urge pivot arm 52 into closure member 54 when valve assembly 24 is in the closed position. Biasing members 56 provide sufficient force to effectuate a low pressure seal of closure member 54 across aperture 30. As pressure increases in lower chamber 20, pressure differential across closure member 54 will maintain the position of the closure member and the compression of the seal across aperture 30.<br>
In order to remove orifice plate carrier 32 from fitting, isolation valve assembly 24 must be opened so that the plate carrier can be moved into upper chamber 22 through aperture 30. As shown in Figure 3, once isolation valve assembly 24 is opened, lower drive 36 is actuated to move orifice plate carrier 32 upwards through aperture 30 into upper chamber 22. Once orifice plate carrier 32 is entirely within upper chamber 22, isolation valve assembly 24 is closed to isolate the upper chamber from bore 34 and lower chamber 20.    Any pressure within upper<br>
chamber 20 can then be relieved and orifice plate carrier 32 can be removed from fitting 12 by loosening clamping bar screws 46 and removing clamping bar 44 and sealing bar 40 from top 18.<br>
Referring now to Figure 4, isolation valve assembly 24 is shown in the open position. Operational shafts 50 and pivot arm 52 have been rotated approximately 45° from the closed position as shown in Figure 3. As pivot arm 52 is rotated, pins 58 move through slot 60. The movement of pins 58 causes closure member 54 to rotate about hinge pins 62. Pivot arm 52 also disengages orifice plate carrier 32 and provides a clear area 64 through which the orifice plate carrier can travel. Pivot arm 52 and closure member 54 are arranged such that the pivot arm rotates about an axis that is offset from the axis about which the closure member rotates. The offset axes allow for a mechanical advantage to be generated by the arrangement of pivot arm 52 and closure member 54 that results in approximately 45° of rotation in the pivot arm generating the full 90° rotation of the closure member.<br>
The components of isolation valve 24 are further illustrated in Figures 5 and 6. Pivot arm 52 comprises U-shaped member 66 having pins 58 mounted to each end and orifice plate carrier locator 68 extending from its center section. As shown in Figures 1 and 2, when isolation valve assembly 24 is in the closed position, locator 68 bears against orifice plate carrier 32 to ensure that the orifice is centered within pipeline 34. Pivot arm 52 is coupled to operational shafts 50 via the engagement of sliding members 72 and slot 74. Sliding members 72 may be a pair of pins, a key. or some other member that rotationally fixes pivot arm 52 to operational shaft 50 while allowing translation along slot 74. In certain embodiments, sliding members may be located on the pivot arm and the slot disposed on the operational shaft. Slot 74 and sliding members 72 provide ease of assembly of the components and allows pivot arm 52 to move relative to operation shafts 50 as biasing members 56 (see Figure 2) urge pivot arm 52 into closure member 54 when valve assembly 24 is in the closed position.<br>
Isolation valve assembly 24 also provides simple assembly of its components. Operational shafts 50 are first installed into body 16 so that sliding members 72 are aligned. Sliding members 72 are then inserted into slot 74 as pivot arm 52 is installed into body 16. Next, pins 58 on pivot arm 52 are inserted into slot 60 on closure member 54 and hinge pins 62 are disposed within receptacles on body 16 or top 18 as closure member 54 is installed. Once the assembly of isolation valve assembly 24 is complete, top 18 can be installed onto body 16.<br>
In certain embodiments, closure member 54 may be constructed so that slots 60 have different widths. As shown in Figure 7, closure member 54 comprises wide slot 76 and narrow slot 78, each located an equal distance 80 from the sealing surface 82 of closure member 54. Each slot engages with pins 58 having equal diameters. As can be seen in Figure 5, pins 58 are each connected to pivot arm 52. As pins 58 move perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of the<br>
slots the pin 58 in narrow slot 78 will engage the side of the narrow slot before the other pin engages the side of wide slot 76. Thus, when closure member 54 is being opened, the opening force applied by the rotation of pivot arm 52 will initially be applied only to the side of the closure member with narrow slot 78. By applying the opening force to only one side of the closure member, the seal between the closure member and the top will tend to peel away gradually, which takes less force than trying to break the entire seal at one time.<br>
Referring now to Figure 8, biasing member 56, in addition to biasing the closure member into sealing engagement as previously discussed, may be used to align orifice plate carrier 32. Biasing member 56 comprises leaf spring 84 and alignment tab 86. When orifice plate carrier 32 is in the metering position, as shown in Figure 1, each side of the plate carrier contacts with an alignment tab 86 of a biasing member 56. The engagement of biasing members 56 helps insure that the rack of orifice plate carrier 32 is engaged with lower drive 36.<br>
Referring now to Figures 9 and 10, operational shafts 400 may be connected to a fitting by bonnets 402 and interlock device 404, which limits the rotation of the shaft. Interlock device 404 comprises boss 406, release pin 408, pin bracket 410, and cover 412. Boss 406 is rotationally fixed to shaft 400, such as by set screw 414. Boss 406 comprises angular slot 416 having first and second pin retention locations 418 and 420. Pin bracket 410 is connected to the fitting body (not shown) so as to be stationary relative to shaft 400. Release pin 408 is mounted to pin bracket 410 and comprises biasing member 422 that urges the pin into engagement with slot 416. Cover 412 surrounds boss 406 and comprises hole 424 through which pin 408 projects. Cover 412 is stationary relative to boss 406.<br>
Interlock device 404 serves to provide a lock that prevents the unintentional rotation of shaft 400 and limit the rotation of the shaft when moving the valve between its opened and closed positions. Figure 10 illustrates interlock device 404 when the valve is in the closed position. Pin 408 is engaged with first retention location 418. The engagement of pin 408 and first retention location 418 prevents the rotation of shaft 400. Pin 408 must be disengaged from first retention location 418 before shaft 400 can be rotated. When shaft 400 is rotated, pin 408 remains engaged with slot 416. This engagement limits the rotation of shaft 400 and prevents rotating the valve past the opened position.<br>
Once in the opened position, pin 408 will engage second retention location 420, giving an indication that the valve is now fully opened. Second retention location 420 may be arranged such that the engagement of pin 408 in the second retention location will not prevent shaft 400 from being rotated back towards the closed position. This allows the valve to be closed quickly without having to manipulate pin 408.    In effect, the engagement between pin 408 and slot 416 prevents<br>
unptentional movement of the isolation valve assembly from the closed position to the opened position while not impeding rotation of the valve from the opened position to the closed position.<br>
The isolation valve arrangements described herein are capable of operating in a compact space that allows for smaller, lighter weight, and more compact dual chamber orifice fitting assemblies. The isolation valve arrangement also provides a valve that is fully actuated with approximately 45 degrees of rotation. This provides significant advantages over a sliding valve that may need several full 360 degree rotations of a drive shaft to fully actuate. Not only does the isolation valve assembly operate quicker by requiring less rotation, but the limited rotation simplifies the automation of the actuation of the valve.<br>
