AN IMPROVED MULTI-LAYER WOVEN FABRIC<br>
USED IN PAPER MAKING MACHINES<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an improved multi-layer woven fabric used in paper<br>
making machines. The invention particularly relates to a multiple layer woven fabric<br>
for paper maker's screen called "wet end" which is used in converting pulp stock to<br>
initial paper web in various kinds of paper making machines.<br>
Back ground of the invention<br>
In the conventional paper making machines, a water slurry or suspension of paper<br>
pulp known as paper making "stock" is fed onto the top of upper run of an endless<br>
belt of woven wire and / or synthetic material that travels between two or more<br>
rollers. This belt is often referred to as "forming fabric", and it provides a paper<br>
making surface on the upper surface of its upper run which acts as a filter to separate<br>
the fiber pulp of the paper stock from the aqueous medium, thereby forming a wet<br>
paper web. The aqueous medium drains through mesh openings of the forming fabric,<br>
which are otherwise known as drainage holes, due to gravity alone or with assistance<br>
of one or more suction boxes located on the lower face of the upper run of the fabric<br>
i.e. machine side of the fabric.<br>
In known processes, after leaving the forming section, the paper web is transferred to<br>
press section of the paper making machine, where it is passed through the nips of one<br>
or more pairs of pressure rollers covered with another type fabric which is ordinarily<br>
referred to as a "press felt". Here due to pressure from the rollers, additional moisture<br>
from the web is removed. The moisture, removal is often enhanced by the presence of<br>
a "Batt" layer of fibers on the press felt. The partially dried paper sheet thus formed is<br>
then conveyed to a "Dryer" section for further removal of moisture. After drying the<br>
paper is ready for finishing process or is sent straight to packaging.<br><br>
Typically, papermaker's fabrics are manufactured as endless belts by one of two<br>
known basic weaving techniques. In one of these techniques fabrics are flat woven by<br>
a flat weaving process, and there ends are joined to form an endless belt by any well<br>
known joining method, such as dismantling and re-weaving the ends together,<br>
commonly known as 'splicing' and 'seaming'. In a flat woven papermaker's fabric, the<br>
warp yarns extend in the machine direction and the filling yarn or weft yarn extend in<br>
the cross machine direction.<br>
As referred to in this specification , the terms "machine direction" (MD) and the<br>
"cross machine direction" (CMD) refer, respectively, to a direction aligned with the<br>
direction of travel of a papermaker's fabric in a paper making machine, and a<br>
direction parallel to the fabric surface and traverse to the direction of travel.<br>
According to the other or the second technique, fabric is woven directly in the form of<br>
a continuous belt with an endless weaving process. In the endless weaving process,<br>
the warp yarns extend in the cross machine direction and the filling yarns extend in<br>
the machine direction of the fabric belt. Both the weaving methods described herein<br>
above are well known in the art and the term "endless belt" used herein refers to belts<br>
made by the unique method.<br>
Effective sheet, fiber support and absence of "wire making" are the important<br>
considerations in the papermaking process, especially for the formation of section of<br>
the papermaking machine where the wet paper web is first formed. The wire marking<br>
is particularly problematic in the making of fine grades of paper, as it can affect a host<br>
of paper properties responsible for determining the quality of paper in the market such<br>
as sheet mark, porosity, uneven formation, pin holes and poor surface quality. Wire<br>
marking is typically the result of individual pulp fibers being oriented within the<br>
paper web such that their ends reside within gaps between the individual yarns of the<br>
forming fabric caused by the weave design on the sheet or web side of the fabric. This<br>
problem or disadvantage is generally addressed by providing a monoplanar surface on<br>
the sheet side that allows pulp fibers to rest on adjacent yarns rather than penetrate the<br>
gaps between the yarns. As used in this specification the term, "monoplanar" means<br>
that the upper extremities of the yarns defining the paper forming surface at<br>
substantially same elevation such that at that level there is presented a substantially<br><br>
"planar" surface. Accordingly, fine paper grades intended for using in quality<br>
printing, carbonizing paper, tissue paper and like grades of fine quality paper need to<br>
be formed on very finely woven fabric surface with monoplanar or co-planar<br>
property.<br>
The applicants have found that such finely woven fabrics include at least some<br>
relatively small diameter machine direction or cross machine direction yarns.<br>
However, such yarns tend to be delicate, leading to a short surface life for the fabric.<br>
Moreover, the use of smaller yarns can also adversely affect the dimensional stability<br>
of the fabric, skew resistance and narrowing resistance, which may impact negatively<br>
both the surface life and the performance of the fabric. Such forming fabrics with one<br>
set of warp i.e., MD yarn and one set of weft i.e., CMD yarn is referred to herein as a<br>
single layer forming fabric.<br>
To mitigate the above noted problems associated with fine weaves, multi-layer<br>
forming fabrics were developed with fine mesh yarns on the paper forming surface to<br>
facilitate paper formation and coarser mesh yarns on the machine contact side to<br>
provide strength and durability. For example, fabrics have been constructed with one<br>
set of machine direction yarns which interweave paper forming surface and a more<br>
durable machine side surface. These fabrics form part of a class of fabrics which are<br>
generally referred to as "double layer" fabrics. Similarly, fabrics were proposed and<br>
manufactured which includes two sets of cross machine direction yarn that form a fine<br>
mesh paper side fabric layer and a separate coarser machine side fabric layer, in these<br>
fabrics, which are a part of a class of fabrics generally referred to as "triple layer"<br>
fabrics, the two fabrics layers are typically bound together by separate woven<br>
stitching weft yarns. The multilayer (double and triple layer) fabrics, because of the<br>
presence of additional sets of yarns compared to single layer fabrics are of higher<br>
"caliper" i.e. thicker and by virtue of their two sided weave for finer paper formation<br>
side and coarser machine side for fabric life is found to be superior than single layer<br>
fabrics.<br>
Although these fabrics have performed successfully, they have some potential<br>
shortcomings or disadvantages due to the inclusion of extra stitching weft yarns<br>
causing inter-layer wear, de lamination of two fabric layers, fabric layer shifting in<br><br>
high warp - high speed paper machines. This shifting causes the fabric to wear and<br>
decrease in thickness, which adversely affects the drainage of the paper making and<br>
consequently it affects performance in paper making and ultimately fabric life. More<br>
often it is this interlayer wear, rather than the wear on the machine that determines the<br>
life of the fabric.<br>
It is evident that the stitching weft yarns in such triple layer fabric need to be strong<br>
enough to bind the top and the bottom layer fabrics together so that the interlayer<br>
wear, shifting and de- lamination of fabric layer is resisted and also need to resist the<br>
machine side fabric surface to withstand wear with paper machine yet be delicate<br>
enough on the paper side surface to produce high quality finer grade paper. It is quite<br>
difficult to strike a balance between the two situations. The applicant's endeavor was<br>
to obviate the problem of the prior art and to innovate an improved multi layer fabric<br>
which is free from the aforesaid drawbacks.<br>
Therefore, one of the objects of the present invention is to mitigate the drawbacks or<br>
disadvantages of the prior art.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to produce an improved multi- layer fabric<br>
used in paper making machine.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide stitching weft yarns which is strong<br>
enough to bind the top and the bottom layer fabrics and also prevents shifting and<br>
delamination of fabric layer.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to prevent the interlayer wear to enhance<br>
the life of the fabric.<br>
A still further object of the invention is to provide a strong multiple layer fabric yet<br>
delicate on the paper side surface to produce high quality and finer grade paper.<br>
These and other objects of the present invention will be apparent from the description<br>
given herein under.<br><br>
According to this invention there is provided a multiple layer paper maker's forming<br>
fabric, consisting of one set of top machine direction (MD) yarns and cross machine<br>
direction (CMD) yarns form a paper side weave and one set of bottom machine<br>
direction (MD) yarns and cross machine direction (CMD) yarns from machine side<br>
weave by interlacing according to the desired weave pattern. The paper side has a<br>
finer weave with small floats whereas the machine side has a coarse weave with<br>
longer floats. The two top and bottom weavers are different by their type. A set of top<br>
CMD yarns interweave between top and bottom layer warps thus binding the two<br>
different weaves, the binder yarns are also an integral part of the main fabric. The top<br>
weave and the bottom weaves are interwoven in a series of repeat units to form a<br>
complete woven fabric. A paper stock may be applied to this newly invented fabric as<br>
described herein, and pulp and water may be separated from paper maker's stock to<br>
produce initial paper web for further processing viz, pressing, drying and other<br>
finishing process for producing high quality and fine paper.<br>
The present invention provide an improved multi-layer woven fabric used in paper<br>
making machines comprising one set of top machine direction (MD) yarns and cross<br>
machine direction (CMD) yarns from paper side weave and a second set of bottom<br>
machine direction (MD) yarns and cross machine direction (CMD) yarns from<br>
machine side weave enlaced by interlacing according to desired weave pattern; said<br>
paper side being provided with a finer weave with small floats and said machine side<br>
being provided with a coarse weave with longer floats; a set of top CMD yarns being<br>
interwoven between said top and bottom layer warps thus binding two different<br>
weaves, the binder yarns being formed an integral part of the main fabric; said top<br>
weave and the bottom weave being interwoven in a series of repeat units to form the<br>
multi-layer woven fabric.<br>
The aforesaid multi-layer woven fabric includes a double layer fabric and a three<br>
layer fabric. A paper stock is applied to said fabric whereby pulp and water are<br>
separated from the paper maker's stock to produce initial paper web for further<br>
processing steps namely, pressing, drying and finishing steps for producing high<br>
quality fine paper.<br><br>
Detail description of the Invention<br>
The present invention will now be explained in detail with reference to the drawings<br>
accompanying the provisional specification wherein:<br>
Figure 1 illustrates paper side binder having weaving pattern of 24-<br>
Sh_4/2_PSB_WnF;<br>
Figure 2 illustrates paper side binder of an alternative type having weaving pattern of<br>
24-Sh_4/2-2/4_PSB_WnF.<br>
In figure 1 (24-Sh_4/2_PSB_WnF), the intended weave pattern has been constructed<br>
on 24 warps i.e., twelve warps 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21 and 23 make the paper side<br>
or top weave and other twelve warps i.e., 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22 and 24 make<br>
the machine side or bottom weave. The total 24 warps make one unit or smallest<br>
weave repeat for warp way pattern. The smallest weft way pattern repeats a<br>
combination of five wefts as shown in the drawings.<br>
Wefts numbered 25,27,28 and 29 are the wefts which constructs the paper side weave<br>
and weft numbered 26 form the machine side weave in interweaving with the twelve<br>
bottom warps. Wefts 25 and 29 are as shown as in figure 1 make plane weave with the<br>
eight top warps and thus form, weave floats or knuckles over and under the top warps.<br>
The knuckles over the warps facing and the paper side are meant for sheet support.<br>
The wefts 27 &amp; 28 are the binder wefts or stitching wefts. The weft 27 forms a plain<br>
weave with top warps 1,3,5,7,9,11 and 13 to dispose four wefts knuckles to the paper<br>
side surface for sheet formation and then goes below the rest of the top warp to bind<br>
with one or more select bottom warp- as per figure with warp # 20.The next weft # 28<br>
herein called the pair of binder with weft # 27, forms a plain weave with top warps at<br>
23, 21,19 and 1,7 and then goes below rest of the warps to bind with one or more pre-<br>
selected bottom warp- as shown in figure 1 of the drawing with warp 10 and 6. Wefts<br>
27 &amp; 28 are called pair because in combination they pass under one common top warp<br>
# 15 in combination leave a weave similar to previous and the next top wefts are<br>
numbered 25 and 29 and at the same time bind the bottom select warp / warps to bind<br>
together both the top and the bottom fabrics. In the smallest weft repeat one machine<br><br>
side weft allowed to form a 5/1 weaves to leave the longer weft float to the machine<br>
surface of the fabric.<br>
In figure - 02 (24-Sh_4/2-2/4_PSB_WnF) the intended weave pattern has been<br>
constructed on 24 warps i.e., twelve warps 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21 and 23 make<br>
the paper side or top weave and other twelve warps i.e., 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22<br>
and 24 make the machine side or bottom weave. The total 24 warps make one unit or<br>
smallest weave repeat for warp way pattern. The smallest weft way pattern repeat is<br>
completed by nine wefts as shown in this figure. Wefts numbered 25, 27,28,29,31 and<br>
33 are the wefts which construct the paper side weave and wefts numbered 26 and 30<br>
form the machine side weaves in inter weaving with the twelve bottom warps.<br>
Weft number 25, 29 and 33 shown in figure 2 make plain weave with the twelve top<br>
warps and thus form weft floats or knuckles over and under the top warps. The<br>
knuckles over the warps facing the paper side are meant for sheet support. The wefts<br>
numbered 27, 28 and 31, 32 are the two pair of binder wefts or stitching wefts. Weft #<br>
27 forms a plain weave with top warps numbered 1,3,5,7,9,11 and 13 to dispose four<br>
weft knuckles to paper side surface for sheet formation and then goes below the rest<br>
of the top warp to bind with one or more select bottom warp- as per the drawings with<br>
warp # 20. The next weft numbered 28 as herein called the pair of binder with weft<br>
27, forms a plain weave with top warps at 23,21, 19 and 17 and then go below rest of<br>
the warps to bind with one or more select bottom warp as shown in the drawings with<br>
warp 10 and 6. Wefts 27 and 28 are called pair because in combination they pass<br>
under one common top warp # 15 in combination they leave a weave similar to<br>
previous and the next top wefts as numbered 25 and 29 and at the same time bind the<br>
bottom select warp / warps to bind together both the top and the bottom fabrics.<br>
The plain portions on top paper side formed by the pair of binder wefts # 27 and 28<br>
and the longer plain weave portion formed by pick 27 on the left side of the weave<br>
pattern as shown herein called "four floats" as it disposes four plain weave weft floats<br>
/ knuckles to the paper side and similarly the short plain weave portion formed by<br>
pick 28 on the right side of the weave 'pattern is herein called "two floats" as it<br>
disposes two plain weave weft floats to the paper side, that herein is called "four and<br>
two" or "4 and 2" or "4/2" combination of the paper side binder weft's pair.<br><br>
Next weft is a paper side complete plain weave pick which is numbered 29 in the<br>
figure and next to this pick # 30 which weaves with the bottom set of warps. Then<br>
again one pair of paper side binder wefts #31 and 32 to weave and bind with the<br>
bottom warps # 14, 18 and # 4 respectively. Typically this two binder pair of picks<br>
have been arranged in weave such that unlike the previous binder pair of pick the<br>
short portion of plain weave is formed on left by the weft #31 and the longer portion<br>
of plain weave is formed on right by the weft # 32, so as to form the smallest weave<br>
repeat with two pair binder or stitching picks disposed in such a fashion, to form a<br>
"4/2" and "2/4" weft plain weave portion (as described herein above) on the paper<br>
side - which is, by this invention is deemed to be a part of a class of fabrics.<br>
To complete the smallest weave repeat a complete plain weave pick #33, which<br>
indicates the completion of the weft repeat on paper side with the intended weave<br>
pattern, otherwise it is just the repetition of the first pick number 25.<br>
In the smallest weft repeat two machine side wefts # 26 and 30 a 5/1 weave to form a<br>
5/1 weave longer weft float on the machine side surface of the fabric.<br>
In the improved multi-layer woven fabric as described herein above, each unit of<br>
intended weave pattern of a smallest weave repeat for warp way pattern comprises a<br>
combination of five wefts as illustrated in the drawings accompanying the provisional<br>
specification.<br>
In the above mentioned improved multi-layer woven fabric the top weave and the<br>
bottom weave are interwoven in a series of repeat units to form a complete woven<br>
fabric.<br>
In another aspect of the invention of the said improved multi-layer woven fabric, said<br>
plain weave pattern said plain weave pattern or paper side surface of the fabric<br>
includes other top layer weave pattern namely, satins, broken twills, various types of<br>
twill and some derivatives of plain weave. Further the improved multi-layer woven<br>
fabric a varied type of yarn is selected from polyester, polyamide, aramid, various co<br><br>
polymers, single or in plurality or in any combination of their position in the fabric<br>
mesh and any yarn or raw material is used.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention is intended to weave a multilayer forming fabric comprising<br>
one finer top fabric and one coarser bottom fabric inter woven by selected weft of<br>
finer top weave to stitch with selected warp of coarser bottom weave and thus<br>
constructing a final fabric comprising a top fine plain type weave for good sheet<br>
support, while a coarse and sturdy satin weave at bottom side for good resistance to<br>
abrasion with paper machine.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the new triple layer - a type of paper<br>
maker's multiple layer forming fabric includes a set of top MD yarns, top CMD yarns,<br>
bottom MD yarns, bottom CMD yarns and stitching CMD yarns or binder CMD yarns<br>
to form one certain weave for the paper side and another weave on the reverse side of<br>
the fabric herein called the machine side and the both independent weaves are bound<br>
together by a plurality of selected CMD yarns of paper side weave herein called<br>
binder weft yarns.<br>
In another embodiment according to the present invention, the forming fabric<br>
discussed above includes a pair of first and second stitching CMD yarns or binders<br>
positioned between a pair or more number of paper side weft yarns woven together<br>
with the top and bottom MD yarns so that, as a paper side weave part of the first<br>
binder weft is inter weaving with the paper side MD yarns and the binding portion of<br>
second binde/ weft is positioned below the rest of top MD yarns and such that as a<br>
sheet support weave portion of the second stitching yarn is inter weaving with the top<br>
MD yarns and a binding portion of the first binder weft is positioned below the top<br>
MD yarns. The first and second binder wefts cross each other as they pass below a<br>
common top MD yarn and each of the binding portions of the first and second binder<br>
wefts pass below one or more number of bottom MD yarn to bind the top and the<br>
bottom weaves together to form an integrated woven fabric comprising of two surface<br>
weaves for paper formation and machine side weave.<br><br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention and embodiments of paper<br>
makers forming fabric described above can be used for making paper. Paper stock<br>
may be applied to a paper maker's forming fabric as described above and moisture<br>
may be removed from paper stock to produce initial paper web.<br>
Although illustrated embodiments employ plain weave pattern for top layer or paper<br>
side surface of the fabric, the present invention also includes within its scope the use<br>
other top layer weave pattern viz, satins, broken twills, various types of twill and<br>
some derivatives of plain weave. The pair of stitching or binder picks weaving style<br>
as the main part of the invention.<br>
It is possible to obtain varied weave pattern by using this particular stitching weave in<br>
combination with changed weave pattern or changed pattern of their position in weave<br>
or making a mixture of yarn weave pattern practiced in fabric weaving industry and<br>
are within the scope of this invention.<br>
The paper maker's fabric defined by 24 Sh_4/2_PSB-WnF in figure 1 and 24-Sh_4/2-<br>
2/4_PSB_WnF in figure 2 can use a varied type of yarn namely, polyester, polyamide,<br>
aramid, various co polymers, single or in plurality or in any combination of their<br>
position in the fabric mesh and any yarn or raw material those will be introduced for<br>
paper maker's forming fabric by the yarn producers in future.<br>
The paper maker's fabric as illustrated in Fig.l or figure 2 are manufactured by the<br>
applicant in any amount of warp and weft density or fabric mesh as well known in this<br>
manufacturing field. Any change in above fabric manufacturing process values on the<br>
invented weave designs shall not be deemed as new concept since it is well within the<br>
ambit of the present invention as these values are usual day today variations practiced<br>
in fabric weaving industry.<br>
It should also be understood that the paper maker's fabric as shown in Figs land 2 can<br>
also be manufactured by changing or introducing different manufacturing process and<br>
/ or machine with equipment or different color or hue.<br><br>
In the paper maker's fabric as illustrated in figures 1 &amp; 2, each of the stitching wefts<br>
can form one or more binding knuckles or floats with one of the bottom MD yarn.<br>
Further a binder weft may not at all make binding with bottom MD yarn as would be<br>
required by skilled fabric designer for different application needs.<br>
The paper maker's fabric as shown in figure 1 the complete plain weave picks i.e.,<br>
pick # 25 and 29 are in singular, but such plain picks can be used in any number<br>
before and after pair of binder wefts and in any combination of weft weave pattern as<br>
would be required by the skill of the fabric designer.<br>
The paper maker's fabric as shown in figure 2 illustrates the complete plain weave<br>
picks i.e., pick #25, 29 and 33 are in singular, but such plain picks can be used in any<br>
