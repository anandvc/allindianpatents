				<td>Nucleotide sequence coding for a TolC and a<br>
defined amino acid sequence.<br>
Field of the invention.<br>
The invention relates to a nucleotide se-<br>
quence coding for a TolC, a plasmid containing<br>
such a nucleotide sequence, a protein or a pep-<br>
tide coded by such a nucleotide sequence, a bac-<br>
terium containing such a nucleotide sequence and<br>
several uses of such bacteria.<br>
Background of the invention and prior art.<br>
Viru1ence- attenuated, intrace11u1ar1y set-<br>
tling bacteria can induce a long-lasting immu-<br>
nity as live vaccines. Up to now, in particular<br>
Salmonella typhi TYla (Levine et al., Lancet<br>
1:1049-1052, 1987), Mycobacterium bovis BCG<br>
(Fine and Rodrigues, Lancet 335:1016-1020, 1990)<br>
and Vibrio cholerae (Levine and Kaper, Vaccine<br>
11: 20 7-212, 1993) were used as live vaccines.<br>
For instance, such variants of Listeria mono-<br>
cytogenes, Salmonella enterica sv. typhimurium<br>
and typhi, and BCG were already used as well-<br>
tolerated live vaccines against typhus and tu-<br>
berculosis. These bacteria, including their at-<br>
tenuated mutants are generally immune-stimulat-<br>
ing and can initiate a fair cellular immune re-<br>
sponse, and were therefore used a vaccine carri-<br>
ers.<br>
The advantage of these bacteria as vaccine<br>
carriers is that they mainly induce a so-called<br>
Th1 immune response (Hess and Kaufmann, FEMS Im-<br>
munol. Med. Microbiol. 23:165-173, 1999). This<br>
immune response is characterized by cytotoxic<br>
lymphocytes (CTL) and by the presence of spe-<br>
cific IFN-gamma- secreting CD4+ T cells (also T<br>
helper cells, Th) (Abbas et al., Nature 383:787-<br>
793, 1996).<br>
For instance, L. monocytogenes stimulates to<br>
a special extent via the activation of TH1-cells<br>
the proliferation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes<br>
(CTL). These bacteria supply secreted antigens<br>
directly into the cytosol of antigen-presenting<br>
cells (APC; macrophages and dendritic cells),<br>
which in turn express the co-stimulating mole-<br>
cules and cause an efficient stimulation of T<br>
cells. The listeriae are in part degraded in<br>
phagosomal compartments, and the antigens pro-<br>
duced by these carrier bacteria can therefore on<br>
the one hand be presented by MHC class II mole-<br>
cules and thus lead to the induction of T helper<br>
cells. On the other hand, the listeriae repli-<br>
cate after release from the phagosome in the cy-<br>
tosol of APCs; antigens produced and <br>
these bacteria are therefore preferably pre-<br>
sented via the MHC class I pathway, thus CTL re-<br>
sponses against these antigens being induced.<br>
Further it could be shown that by the interac-<br>
tion of the listeriae with macrophages, natural<br>
killer cells (NK) and neutrophilic granulocytes,<br>
the expression of such cytokines (TNF-alpha,<br>
IFN-gamma, 11-2, IL-12; Unanue, Curr. Opin. Im-<br>
munol. 9:35-43, 19 9 7; Mata and Paterson, J. Im-<br>
munol. 163:14 4 9-144 56, 1999) is induced, for<br>
which an antitumoral effectiveness was detected.<br>
Recombinant bacteria were thus capable to<br>
protect against a heterologous tumor (Medina et<br>
al., Eur. J. Immunol. 29:693-699, 1999; Pan et<br>
al., Cancer Res. 59:5264-5269, 1999; Woodlock et<br>
al., J. Immunother. 22:251-259, 1999; Paglia et<br>
al . , Blood 92:3172-3176, 1998; Paglia et al.,<br>
Eur. J. Immunol. 27:1570-1575, 1997; Pan et al.,<br>
Nat. Med. 1:471-477, 1995; Pan et al., Cancer<br>
Res. 55:4776-4779, 1995).<br>
By the administration of L. monocytogenes,<br>
which were transduced for the expression of tu-<br>
mor antigens, the growth of experimental tumors<br>
could be inhibited antigen-specifica11y (Pan et<br>
al., Nat. Med. 1:471-477, 1995; Cancer Res.<br>
59:5264-5269, 1999; Voest et al., Natl. Cancer<br>
Inst. 87:581-586, 1995; Beatty and Paterson, J.<br>
Immunol. 16 5:5502-5508, 2000).<br>
Virulence-attenuated , Salmonella enterica<br>
strains, into which nucleotide sequences coding<br>
for tumor antigens had been introduced, as tumor<br>
antigen-expressing bacterial carriers, could<br>
provide after oral administration a specific<br>
protection against different experimental tumors<br>
(Medina et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 30:768-777,<br>
2000; Zoller and Christ, J. Immunol. 166:3440-<br>
34450, 2001; Xiang et al., PNAS 97:5492-5497,<br>
2000) .<br>
Recombinant Salmonella strains were also ef-<br>
fective as prophylactic vaccines against virus<br>
infections (HPV; Benyacoub et al., Infect. Im-<br>
mun. 67:3674-367 9, 1999) and for the therapeutic<br>
treatment of a mouse tumor immortalized by a tu-<br>
mor virus (HPV) (Revaz et al., Virology 279:354-<br>
360, 2001).<br>
For the use as a vaccine carrier, methods<br>
were developed to express expression products of<br>
nucleic acid sequences introduced into bacteria<br>
on the cell membrane of these bacteria or to<br>
have them secreted by these bacteria. The basis<br>
of these methods is the Escherichia coli hemo-<br>
lysin system hlyAs representing the prototype of<br>
a type I secretion system of gram-negative bac-<br>
teria. By means of the hlyAs, secretion vectors<br>
were developed that allow an efficient discharge<br>
of protein antigens in Salmonella enterica,<br>
Yersinia enterocolitica and Vibrio cholerae.<br>
Such secretion vectors contain the cDNA of an<br>
arbitrary protein antigen coupled to the nucleo-<br>
tide sequence for the hlyA signal peptide, for<br>
the hemolysin secretion apparatus, hlyB and hlyD<br>
and the hly-specific promoter. By means of this<br>
secretion vector, a protein can for instance be<br>
expressed on the surface of this bacterium. Such<br>
genetically modified bacteria induce as vaccines<br>
a considerably stronger immune protection than<br>
bacteria, wherein the protein expressed by the<br>
introduced nucleic acid remains inside the cell<br>
(Donner et al. , EP 1015023 A; Gentschev et al.,<br>
Gene 179:133-140, 1996; Vaccine 19; 2621-2618,<br>
2001; Hess et al., PNAS 9 3:1458-1463, 1996). The<br>
disadvantage of this system is however that by<br>
using the hly-specific promoter the amount of<br>
the protein expressed by the bacterium is small.<br>
Further transport systems in bacteria repre-<br>
sent for instance, i) the transport signal for<br>
the S-layer protein (Rsa A) of Caulobacter cres-<br>
centus, where - for the secretion and the mem-<br>
brane-bound expression - the C-terminal RsaA<br>
transport signal is to be used (Umelo-Njaka et<br>
al., Vaccine 19:1406-1415, 2001), and ii) the<br>
transport signal for the Internalin A of Lis-<br>
teria monocytogenes. For the secretion, the N -<br>
terminal transport signal is necessary, and for<br>
the membrane-bound expression, the N-terminal<br>
transport signal together with the C-terminal<br>
part containing the LPXTG motive responsible for<br>
the cell wall anchoring (Dhar et al., Biochemis-<br>
try 39 : 3725-3733, 2000) .<br>
In another context, the integral membrane<br>
protein TolC of E. coli is known. This is a mul-<br>
ti-functional pore-forming protein of the outer<br>
membrane of E. coli, which, in addition to func-<br>
tions, such as e.g. reception of Colicin El (Mo-<br>
rona et al., J. Bacteriol. 153:693-699, 1983)<br>
and the secretion of Colicin V (Fath et al., J.<br>
Bacteriol. 173:7549-7556, 1991), also serves as<br>
a receptor for the U3 phage (Austin et al., J.<br>
Bacteriol. 17 2:5312-5325, 1990). This protein is<br>
not only found in E. coli, but also in a multi-<br>
tude of gram-negative bacteria (Wiener, Struc-<br>
ture Fold. Des. 8:171-5, 2000).<br>
The crystal structure of the TolC protein<br>
shows that it forms, as a homotrimer, a tunnel<br>
channel having a length of about 120 Angstroms,<br>
the biggest part of the homodimer, the tunnel<br>
domain, being localized in the periplasm and<br>
only two little loops (amino acids 52-61 and<br>
257-279) being settled on the surface of the<br>
bacterium (Koronakis et al., Nature 405:914-919,<br>
2000) . The tolC gene has the nucleotide sequence<br>
published by Niki et a 1., Nucleotide sequence of<br>
the tolC gene of Escherichia coli, Nucleic Acids<br>
Res. 18 (18), 5547 (1990). TolC is part of at<br>
least four different bacterial export systems by<br>
representing the membrane tunnel, through which<br>
the export of the bacterial protein is made pos-<br>
sible. For instance in the hlyA transport sys-<br>
tem, the connection between hlyD and the peri-<br>
plasmic end of the TolC permits the export of<br>
the hemolysin from the hlyD into the membrane<br>
tunnel of the TolC (Gentschev et al., Trends in<br>
Microbiology 10:39-45, 2002).<br>
Technical object of the invention.<br>
The invention is based on the technical ob-<br>
ject to specify a transport system, by means of<br>
which an expression product having a higher ef-<br>
ficiency can be presented on an outer cell mem-<br>
brane .<br>
Basic concept of the invention and preferred em-<br>
bodiment s .<br>
For achieving the above technical object, the<br>
invention teaches a nucleotide sequence coding<br>
for a TolC and a defined amino acid sequence,<br>
said defined amino acid sequence being inserted<br>
in the permissive, membrane-external area of the<br>
TolC .<br>
By the invention, a new transport system in<br>
gram-negative bacteria is achieved, by means of<br>
which larger amounts of a protein expressed by a<br>
gene within a bacterium can be transported on<br>
the outer cell membrane of the bacterium than<br>
was possible with prior art transport systems.<br>
Surprisingly, the transport system for the TolC<br>
protein of Escherichia coli permits a substan-<br>
tially stronger membrane-bound expression of a<br>
peptide or protein (arbitrary) than was known<br>
from prior art transport proteins, and that for<br>
a multitude of gram-negative bacteria. The mem-<br>
brane-bound expression of the defined amino acid<br>
sequence or gene product is exclusively achieved<br>
by the TolC.<br>
A defined amino acid sequence may be an arbi-<br>
trary qiven peptide or a protein, an arbitrary<br>
pharmaceutical active substance, an arbitrary<br>
antigen, an arbitrary antibody, or an arbitrary<br>
1igand.<br>
The TolC may be a (wild-tvpe) TolC protein<br>
according to ACCESSION X54049, to which hereby<br>
explicitly reference is made, or a (preferably<br>
N-terminal) partial sequence thereof or a mutant<br>
of the protein or of the partial sequence, for<br>
the partial, s, eaue nee or the mutant the transport<br>
functionality being maintained. N-terminal par-<br>
tial sequences means any partial sequence begin-<br>
ning in the N-terminal area amino acids 1 to 50<br>
of the TolC protein and ending at the C-terminal<br>
end of a loop, which is settled on the surface<br>
of the bacterium. Preferred is thus the N-termi-<br>
nal transport signal of TolC, but also the cen-<br>
tral part of the protein, which represents the<br>
extracellular areas of TolC. A mutant may com-<br>
prise an insertion, deletion or substitution, as<br>
long as the transport functionality is not dis-<br>
tinctly reduced thereby.<br>
For certain applications, it may be recom-<br>
mended that a defined amino acid sequence be in-<br>
serted on one side or both sides by a spacer se-<br>
quence. This will however only be helpful, if<br>
the defined amino acid sequence is to be pre-<br>
sented in a certain spatial structure, for in-<br>
stance in the case of an antigen, and this does<br>
however not take place by the defined amino acid<br>
sequence itself for steric or configurative rea-<br>
sons to a desired extent. Then a spacer sequence<br>
may be formed in particular by a sequence natu-<br>
rally following the defined amino acid sequence,<br>
thus the defined amino acid sequence being<br>
folded in the same way as in the natural anti-<br>
gen. The spacer sequence may however also be ar-<br>
tificial, if thus a desired presentation and/or<br>
folding of the defined amino acid sequence is<br>
obtained. This can easily be calculated by means<br>
of theoretical methods, under consideration of<br>
the spatial conditions at the position of inser-<br>
tion in the TolC .<br>
In detail it is preferred that the defined<br>
amino acid sequence is inserted in the N-termi-<br>
nal area of the TolC, in particular in the area<br>
of the amino acids 52 to 61 and/or 257 to 279<br>
(each referred to the TolC protein) .<br>
Subject matter of the invention is further a<br>
plasmid containing a nucleotide sequence accord-<br>
ing to the invention and a protein or peptide<br>
coded by a nucleotide sequence according to the<br>
invention.<br>
The invention further teaches a bacterium<br>
containing a nucleotide sequence according to<br>
the invention, the TolC causing the transport of<br>
the defined amino acid sequence on the membrane<br>
of the bacterium. In other words, in the bacte-<br>
rium is caused the membrane-bound expression of<br>
a gene product by the TolC protein. Subject mat-<br>
ter of the invention is thus also a gram-nega-<br>
tive bacterium, which contains at least one nu-<br>
cleotide sequence coding for at least one de-<br>
fined amino acid sequence and for at least one<br>
E. coli TolC gene product. This E. coli TolC<br>
gene product preferably is wild-type. Subject<br>
matter of the invention are however also mutated<br>
E. coli TolC gene products, wherein the trans-<br>
port signal activity has been maintained. Pref-<br>
erably, the bacterium is selected from the group<br>
composed of "Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli,<br>
Vibrio cholerae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shig-<br>
ella spp. and Yersinia spp.".<br>
Nucleotide sequences and bacteria can be used<br>
for various applications. For instance, the in-<br>
vention also teaches a pharmaceutical composi-<br>
tion containing a bacterium according to the in-<br>
vention, and as an option at least one physio-<br>
logically tolerable carrier substance, wherein<br>
the defined amino acid sequence is selected ac-<br>
cording to a given substance to be bound in an<br>
organism. By means of such a pharmaceutical com-<br>
position, substances interfering with the normal<br>
cellular metabolism, for instance exogenous<br>
toxicants or mutation-caused endogenous sub-<br>
stances such as octagons can be bound and thus<br>
inhibited. Further, by binding certain cellular<br>
target substances, metabolism processes can be<br>
modulated by removal of normal complex partners<br>
or those being regulated-up because of a dis-<br>
ease. Thereby, for instance a defined associa-<br>
tion is inhibited, and the shuttle related<br>
thereto is regulated down. Such a process can in<br>
turn be used for regu1ating-up other related<br>
processes. Insofar, the defined amino acid se-<br>
quence needs only be selected according to the<br>
target molecule to be inhibited with high speci-<br>
ficity. Such a pharmaceutical composition thus<br>
serves at last for therapeutic purposes.<br>
A pharmaceutical composition suitable for<br>
vaccination purposes contains a bacterium ac-<br>
cording to the invention and as an option at<br>
least one physiologically tolerable carrier sub-<br>
stance, wherein the defined amino acid sequence<br>
is an immunization sequence. An immunization se-<br>
quence stimulates in an organism the generation<br>
of antibodies against a natural antigen, which<br>
contains as a partial sequence the immunization<br>
sequence or is composed thereof.<br>
For diagnostic purposes, the invention<br>
teaches a diagnostic kit containing a bacterium<br>
according to one of claims 7 to 9, wherein the<br>
defined amino acid sequence specifically binds a<br>
marker substance to be determined. If for in-<br>
stance a tissue or fluid sample is taken from an<br>
organism, and this sample, if applicable after a<br>
pre-treatment with separation of undesired sam-<br>
ple components, is incubated with the bacterium,<br>
the binding events at the defined amino acid se-<br>
quence can be detected, and in case of a binding<br>
event, it is detected that the substance spe-<br>
cifically binding to the defined amino acid se-<br>
quence is contained in the sample. The detection<br>
of binding events can be made in various ways<br>
well known to the average man skilled in the<br>
art .<br>
Finally, the invention teaches a preparative<br>
binding substance containing a bacterium accord-<br>
ing to the invention, wherein the defined amino<br>
acid sequence specifically binds a target sub-<br>
stance to be separated from a solution. By such<br>
a binding substance, undesired substances can on<br>
the one hand specifically be removed from a so-<br>
lution by that the solution is incubated with<br>
the bacterium, and the bacterium is discarded<br>
after separation. On the other hand, a separa-<br>
tion or an enrichment of a target substance may<br>
be performed in a corresponding manner, namely<br>
by that after the incubation the target sub-<br>
stance is eluted from the bacterium. In this<br>
context, too, the invention can be used for the<br>
separation and/or enrichment of antigens, of an-<br>
tibodies, peptides, proteins or ligands.<br>
Examples of execution.<br>
Example 1: preparation of the TolC vector.<br>
The tolC gene of E. coli including its wild-<br>
type promoter was amplified by means of PCR (1<br>
min 94°C, 1 min 66°C, 1 min 30 s 72°C) with the<br>
oligonucleotides 5'TolC (5'-TAACGCCCTATGTCGAC-<br>
TAACGCCAACCTT-3 ' ) and 3'TolC ( 5 ' - AGAGGATGTCGAC-<br>
TCGAAATTGAAGCGAGA-3') from the plasmid pAX629<br>
(C. Wandersman, Institute Pasteur, Paris). At<br>
both ends, an additional Sail interface was in-<br>
troduced. The purified PCR product (QIAquick PCR<br>
Purification Kit - Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was<br>
digested with the restriction endonuclease SalI<br>
and cloned into the vector pBR322 pre-split with<br>
SalI. The vector thus constructed was designated<br>
pBR32 2toIC. The functionality of the cloned tolC<br>
gene was then investigated in several tests.<br>
Example 2: introduction of an antigen sequence<br>
into the sequence of the TolC pro-<br>
tein.<br>
In the tolC sequence coding for one of the<br>
extracellular loops, a KpnI interface was iden-<br>
tified. This was used for cloning antigenic pep-<br>
tide sequences of the p60 protein (iap gene) of<br>
Listeria monocytogenes and permitted an inser-<br>
tion of foreign antigens behind amino acid 271<br>
of the mature TolC protein.<br>
The iap sequence coding for a B cell epitope<br>
(amino acids 291 - 301) and a C D4 - re s t r i nged T<br>
cell epitope (amino acids 301 - 312) of the p60<br>
protein was cloned as a Kpnl fragment into the<br>
vector pBR322tolC pre-cut with Kpnl (Fig. 1) .<br>
The plasmid thus obtained was designated pBR322-<br>
tolC::LisTB.<br>
Fig. 1 shows the cloning strategy for the in-<br>
sertion of the p60 -specific epitope sequences<br>
into the wild-type pla smid-coded E. coli tolC<br>
gene on the vector pBR322. There are: bla - am-<br>
picillin resistance gene; Tc - tetracycline; T -<br>
L. monocytogenes p60 T cell epitope (AS 301<br>
312); B - L . monocytogenes p60 B cell epitope<br>
(AS 291 - 301); PtolC - wild-type E. coli tolC<br>
p romote r.<br>
Example 3: expression of the antigen on the mem-<br>
brane of a gram-negative bacterium<br>
(Escherichia coli).<br>
The expression of the epitopes of the p60<br>
protein from L. monocytogenes within the TolC<br>
protein was detected in a Western blot. For this<br>
purpose, cell lysate proteins of E. coli CC118<br>
tolC, E. coli CC118tolC/pBR322tolC and E. coli<br>
CC118tolC/pBR322tolC::ListTB were isolated in<br>
the late logarithmic phase. The applied cell<br>
protein totals corresponded to approx. 100 mil-<br>
lions bacteria. The proteins were separated in a<br>
15% SDS polyacrylamide gel, and the expression<br>
of the chimeric TolC proteins or of the inserted<br>
epitopes were detected on the one hand with a<br>
polyclonal serum against the TolC protein and on<br>
the other hand with the monoclonal antibody K317<br>
(Rowan et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 3 8:2643-2648,<br>
2000) specifically directed against the B cell<br>
epitope from L. monocytogenes (Fig. 2B) .<br>
As expected, no TolC protein could be de-<br>
tected in the cell lysate of E. coli CC118 tolC,<br>
which can be explained by a mutation* in the<br>
chromosomal tolC gene in this strain (Schlor et<br>
al., Mol. Gen. Genet. 256:306-319, 1997). The<br>
complementation with pBR322toiC led in this<br>
strain to the expression of the 52 kDa large<br>
TolC protein. The insertion of the L. monocyto -<br>
genes epitopes into the TolC protein did not af-<br>
fect the expression of TolC and led to a slight<br>
modification of the size of the chimeric protein<br>
of approx. 3 kDa.<br>
The expression of the p60-specific epitopes<br>
in E. coli CC118 to 1C/pBR322to1C: :ListB could be<br>
confirmed with the monoclonal p60 antibody K317.<br>
Example 4: detection of the exposed localization<br>
of the L. monocytogenes p60 epitopes<br>
in Salmonella enteritidis SM6T<br>
( tolC) .<br>
Since the insertion position of the two lis-<br>
terial p60 epitopes was in an extracellular loop<br>
of TolC behind amino acid 271 of the mature pro-<br>
tein, they should be present in an exposed man-<br>
ner at the surface of S. enteritidis SM6T (Stone<br>
et al., Mol. Microbiol. 17:701-712, 1995). The<br>
definitive extracellular localization of the<br>
p60-specific epitopes in S. enteritidis SM6T was<br>
tested by indirect immuno fluorescenee . 25 µl<br>
each of an overnight culture of S. enteritidis<br>
SM6T/pBR322tolC and S. enteritidis SM6T/pBR322<br>
tcolC::LisTB were dropped onto object carriers<br>
and air-dried. The cells were stained with the<br>
monoclonal p60 antibody K317 (1:200), and bound<br>
antibodies were then detected with an FITC-la-<br>
beled secondary anti-mouse serum (Dianova, Ger-<br>
many, working titer: 1:40) .<br>
The f1uorescence-microscopic analysis con-<br>
firmed the extracellular localization of the L.<br>
monocytogenes-specific epitopes in the strain S.<br>
enteritidis SM6T/pBR322tolC::LisTB.<br>
Example 5: immunization tests with the gram-neg-<br>
ative bacterium and analysis of the<br>
protective immune responses after in-<br>
fection with wild-type L. monocyto-<br>
gene s.<br>
In order to find out whether the exposed ex-<br>
pression of the T cell epitope from the p60 pro-<br>
tein of L. monocy togenes in the murine listerio-<br>
sis model leads to a protection, 8 female balb/c<br>
mice (Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany) having<br>
an age of six weeks were orally immunized with a<br>
dose of 1x107 S. enteritidis SM6T/pBR322tolC:<br>
:LisTB. For control purposes, 5 female mice were<br>
orally immunized with S. enteritidis SM6T. The<br>
animals were immunized a second time three weeks<br>
later with the same dose of bacteria.<br>
The immunization success was tested five<br>
weeks after the first immunization in an immune<br>
blot, on which were applied supernatant proteins<br>
of Listeria monocytogenes. Anti-p60 -specific an-<br>
tibodies could be detected in the serum of the<br>
mice immunized with S. ente ri t idis SM6T/pBR322-<br>
tolC::LisTB.<br>
Three weeks after the second immunization,<br>
the animals were intravenously infected with<br>
5x104 L. monocytogene s EGD, the five-fold LD50.<br>
Whilst the survival rate for the balb/c mice im-<br>
munized with S. enteritidis SM6T/pBR322tolC: -<br>
: LisTB after intravenous infection with L. mono-<br>
cytogene s EGD was 88%, the survival rate in the<br>
control group was only 20%.<br>
Thus the expression of the p60-specific epi-<br>
topes within an extracellular loop of TolC in<br>
the attenuated S. enteritidis carrier strain<br>
SM6T led to the induction of L i s te r ia mono cyto-<br>
genes-specific immune responses, which were ca-<br>
pable to protect balb/c mice against a usually<br>
lethal infection. Since the induction of anti-<br>
bodies against the B cell epitope from the p60<br>
protein could be detected in a Western blot, it<br>
is obvious that an immune reaction under par-<br>
ticipation of the antibodies has caused the ob-<br>
served protection of the mice against an other-<br>
wise lethal infection with L. monocytogenes.<br>
