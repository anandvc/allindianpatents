The present invention relates to a body frame for a<br>
scooter-type vehicle, and particularly to a body frame<br>
for a scooter-type vehicle including a front frame which<br>
is formed by casting and has at its front end a head pipe<br>
for steerably supporting a front wheel, and a rear frame<br>
which is fo.rmed into a rearwardly, upwardly extending<br>
shape by casting and is fastened to a rear end of the<br>
front frame.<br>
(Prior Art]<br>
The body frame of this type has been conventionally disclosed, for example, in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Hei 10-'218 0 65..<br><br>
The above-described prior art body frame, however, has a problem.  Since a rear end of a front frame is fastened to a front end of a rear frame along fastening planes thereof extending substantially in the horizontal direction, on the projection of a head pipe and the fastening planes of the rear end of front frame and the front end of the rear frame to a plane parallel to the fastening planes, the fastening planes are disposed at positions apart from a lower end of the head pipe.  As a result, when there occurs an error in assembling the rear frame to the front frame,"a variation in position of the head pipe with respect to the center line of the rear frame in the width direction becomes relatively large.<br>
In view of the foreg"bing, the present invention has been made, and an object of the present invention is to provide a body frame for a scooter-type vehicle, which is capable of making relatively small a variation in position of a head pipe with respect to the center line of a rear frame in the width direction, even if there occurs an error in assembling the rear frame to a front frame.<br>
[Means for Solving the Problem]<br>
To achieve the above subject, according to the invention<br>
-3-<br><br>
there is provided a body frame for,	.	:—r-r—-.	-<br>
a scooter-type vehicle including: a front frame which, is formed by casting and has at its front end a head pipe for steerably supporting a front wheel; and a rear frame which is formed into a rearwardly, upwardly extending shape by casting and is fastened to a rear end of the front frame, characterized in that front fastening plates tilted forwardly, downwardly are provided at the rear end of the front frame and rear fastening plates tilted forwardly, downwardly are provided at the front end of the rear frame; and the rear fastening plates are overlapped and fastened to the front fastening plates.<br>
With this configuration, the rear fastening plates provided on the-fear frame in such a manner as to be tilted-forwardly, downwardly are overlapped and fastened to the front fastening plates provided on the front frame in such a manner as to be tilted forwardly, downwardly, and accordingly, on the projection of the head pipe and the fastening planes of the fastening plates to a plane parallel to the fastening planes, the fastening planes are disposed at positions relatively close to the head pipe.  As a result, even if there occurs an error in assembling the rear frame to the front frame, it is possible to make a variation in position of the head pipe<br>
4<br><br>
relatively small, with respect to the center line of the rear frame in the width direction.<br>
According to invention in addition to the configuration<br>
of the invention described	<br>
in claim 1, wherein an extension line of an axial line of at least one of a plurality of bolts for fastening the rear fastening plates to the front fastening plates is set to pass through a space between an upper end of a steering handlebar steerably supported by the head pipe and an axle of the front wheel.  With this configuration, on the projection of the head pipe and the fastening pJLanes of the front fastening plates an.d the rear fastening plates to a plane parallel to the fastening plane's7 the fastening planes are disposed "at positions closer to the head'pipe.  Accordingly, even if there occurs an error in assembling the rear frame to trie front frame, it is possible to further suppress a variation in position of the head pipe with respect to the center line of the rear frame in the width direction.<br>
According	to  an  invention  in  addition  to  the<br>
configuration	of  the  invention  described     in  claim<br>

either on the	front   fastening  plates   or  the   rear<br><br>
fastening plates, and fitting recesses in which the fitting projections are to be fitted are provided in the other rear fastening plates or the front fastening plates; and extension lines of axial lines of the fitting projections and the fitting recesses are set to pass through a space between an upper end of a steering handlebar steerably supported by the head pipe and an axle of the front wheel.  With this configuration, on the projection of.the head pipe and the fastening planes of the front fastening plates and the rear fastening plates to a plane parallel to the fastening planes, the fastening planes are disposed at positions closer to the head pipe.  Accordingly, eve_n..if there occurs an error in assembling the rear frame to the front frame, it is possible to further suppress a variation in position of the head pipe with respect to the center line of the rear frame in the width direction; and further, it is possible to improve the accuracy in assembling the body frame by fastening the rear frame to the front frame.<br>
According to an invention in addition to the configuration of the invention described earlier, the front frame integrally includes the head pipe, a down frame extending rearwardly, downwardly  from  the head pipe,  and  floor  supporting<br>
6<br><br>
frames extending rearwardly from a lower end of the down frame and disposed under the step .floor; and the rear fastening plates are overlapped, from below, to the front fastening plates provided on rear ends of the floor supporting frames.  With this configuration, since it is not required to ensure a space for disposing the rear frame at a position over the rear ends of the floor supporting frames, it is possible to allow the step floor to extend up tc the position over the rear ends of the floor supporting frames, and hence to ensure large space of the step floor.<br>
According to an invention, in addition to the configuration of the invention earlier, three or more pieces of the fitting<br>

The function of this embodiment will be described below.  The body frame F of the scooter-type vehicle is formed by fastening the front frame 23, rear frame 24, and sub-frame 22 to each other.  At least one of the frames 23, 24 and 22 is formed by casting (the front frame 23 and rear frame 24 are formed by casting in this embodiment). Accordingly, by commonly using either the front frame 23 or the rear frame 24 to various kinds of motorcycles different in part of the body frames, it is possible to reduce the design and manufacturing costs of the body frame required for change in kind of the motorcycle.  Further, since it is possible to modularize<br><br>
the frames 23, 24 and 22 and perform the assembly of parts for each of the frames 23, 24 and 22, and hence to manufacture a scooter-type motorcycle by assembling the three modules having been sub-assembled to each other, and hence to improve the assembling efficiency in the process of manufacturing the scooter-type motorcycle. 4-0 0 01]-"<br>
The front frame 23 including the head pipe 25, down frame 26, and floor supporting frames 272 and 27x   is integrally formed by casting; the rear frame 24 formed by casting are fastened to the rear ends of the floor supporting frames 272 and 271, and the sub-frame 22 formed by welding the metal pipes is fastened to the rear end of the rear frame 24.  Accordingly, the sub-frame 22 relatively low in design and manufacturing costs is allowed to easily keep up with the change in any kind of the motorcycle by changing the metal pipes to be welded. {0062^<br>
The rear frame 24 is fastened to the pair of right and left floor supporting frames 272 and 21 x   of the front frame 23 by overlapping and fastening the rear fastening plates 612 and 61t provided at the branched front ends of the rear frame 24 to the front fastening plates 562 and 561 provided at the rear ends of the floor supporting frames 272 and 27:.  Each of the front fastening plates 562<br><br>
and 56, and the rear fastening plates 612 and 6lx is, as shown in Fig. 24(a), formed into a shape tilted forwardly, downwardly.  Accordingly, on the projection of the head pipe 25 and the fastening planes of the fastening plates 562, 561, 612 and 61! to a plane parallel to the fastening planes, as shown in Fig. 24(b), the fastening planes of the fastening plates 562, 56x, 612 and 61x are disposed at positions relatively close to the head pipe 25. With this configuration, as shown in Fig. 24(b), even if there occurs an error in assembling the rear fastening plates 612 and 61x on the rear frame 24 side to the front fastening plates 562 and 56: on the front frame 23 side and thereby the position of the head pipe 25 is tilted from the center line C of the rear frame 24 in the width direction.  Thus, it is possible to make relatively small displacement amounts §1 and 82 of the position of the head pipe 25 with respect to the center line C of the rear frame 24 in the width direction, and hence to improve the positioning accuracy of the front wheel WF and the rear wheel WR to the vehicular body.<br>
Further, the extension line L of the axial line of at least one the pairs of bolts 64 for fastening the front fastening plates 562 and 56t to the rear fastening plates 61, and 611 (the extension lines L of the axial<br><br>
lines of the pair of bolts 64 in this embodiment) is set to pass through the space between the upper end of the steering handlebar 32 supported by the head pipe 25 and the axle 31 of the front wheel WF, so that the above fastening planes are disposed at positions closer to the head pipe 25. As a result, even if there occurs an error in assembling the rear frame 24 to the front frame 23, it is possible to make small the displacement amounts 5l and 52 of the position of the head pipe 25 with respect to the center line C of the rear frame 24 in the width direction. i0 06 4]<br>
On the contrary, if the fastening planes of the rear ends of the front frame 23 and the front ends of the rear frame 24 are not tilted forwardly, downwardly as shown in Fig. 25(a), but extend substantially in the horizontal direction, on the projection of the head pipe 25 and the above fastening planes of the rear ends of the front frame 23 and the front ends of the rear frame 24 to a plane parallel to the fastening planes, as shown in Fig. 25(b), the fastening planes are disposed at positions relatively apart from the head pipe 25.  As a result, when there occurs an error in assembling the rear frame 24 to<br>
the front frame 23, the displacement amounts §1 and §2 of the position of the head pipe 25 with respect to the<br>
—37-<br><br>
center line C of the rear frame 24 in the width direction becomes relatively large.<br>
Since the rear fastening plates 612 and 61: are overlapped from below to the front fastening plates 562 and 561# a space for disposing the rear frame 24 over the rear ends of the floor supporting frames 272 and 27x is not required to be ensured. As a result, it is possible to allow the step floor 41b to extend up to a position over the rear ends of the floor supporting frames 272 and 271( and hence to make large the space of the step floor 41b. 40 06 6]<br>
Since the fitting recesses 58 are provided in the rear ends of the floor supporting frames 272 and 27j and the fitting projections 63 to be fitted in the fitting recesses 58 are provided on the front ends of the rear frame 24, it is possible to improve the assembling accuracy in fastening and assembling the rear frame 24 to the front frame 23.<br>
Further, since three or more (three in this embodiment) pieces of the fitting recesses 58 are formed in the rear ends of the floor supporting frames 272 and 27, and three or more (three in this embodiment) pieces of<br><br><br>
the fitting projections 63 are provided on the front ends of the rear frame 24, it is possible to further improve the accuracy in assembling the rear frame 24 to the front frame 23. [00G0]<br>
Since the down frame 26 of the front frame 23 is formed into the groove-shape opened upwardly, downwardly, the front wheel WF is allowed to be closer to the down frame 26 without reducing the cross-sectional shape of the down frame 26. Accordingly, it is possible to shorten the length of the wheel base while avoiding interference between the front wheel WF and the down frame 26, and sufficiently ensuring the space of the step floor 41b. [-0069]<br>
Since the pair of right and left floor supporting frames 272 and 27x are each formed into the groove-shape opened upwardly, when an external force is applied to the body frame F, the floor supporting frames 272 and 21x  are deflected in such a manner that the areas of the upper opening portions thereof are changed.  This makes it possible to improve the riding comfort. [0070]<br>
Since the ribs 52 extending in the longitudinal direction are provided on the floor supporting frames 272 and 27L, when an external force is applied to the body<br><br>
frame F, the floor supporting frames 272 and 27x are allowed to be deflected with their rigidities not reduced so much. f0071j<br>
The front ends of the floor supporting frames 272 and 27j are disposed on both the sides of the lower end of the down frame 26, the step floor 41b can be disposed in such a manner as to extend up to both the sides of the lower end of the down frame 26, and hence to sufficiently ensure the space of the step floor 41b on the front side without enlarging the wheel base. [0072]<br>
The front ends of the floor supporting frames 272 and 27, are connected to both the sides of the lower end of the down frame 26 via the pair of curved portions 502 and 50, expanded forwardly from the front surface of the lower end of the down frame 26, the connection portions between the down frame 26 and the floor supporting frames 272 and 27, are expanded forwardly as the curved portions 502 and 50, although the front ends of the pair of floor supporting frames 272 and 21 x  extending in line are disposed at the connection portions.  As a result, it is possible to sufficiently increase the strength of the connection portions. f0073j<br>

In addition, the front wheel WF can be disposed close to the curved portions 502 and 50, side while ensuring a gap between the front wheel WF and the curved portions 502 and 50, by providing the recesses 51 on the opposed inner sides of the curved portions 502 and 50, so that it is possible to avoid an inconvenience that the wheel base is enlarged by the fact that the front ends of the floor supporting frames 272 and 27a are connected to the down frame 26 via the curved portions 502 and 50,  <br>
With respect to the vibration-proof link 66 for swingably supporting the engine E of the power unit P on the body frame F, the pair of right and left links 682 and 68t are provided for swingably connecting the pair of right and left engine side brackets 672 and 67x provided on the engine E to the body frame F, and the cross-member 69 is provided for connecting the right and left links 682 and 68x to each other.  The cross-member 69 is formed into the approximately U-shape opened downwardly, and is disposed at a position astride the intake pipe 83 for connecting the carburetor 35 disposed behind the links 682 and 68x to the engine E on the front side of the links 682 and 68x. Accordingly, as compared with a structure in which the carburetor 35 is disposed in front of the links 682 and 681( the degree of freedom in arrangement of the<br>
41<br>
I   1<br><br>
carburetor 35 becomes larger.  <br>
Further, since the engine E is a four-cycle engine disposed substantially in the hori2ontal direction and the cross-member 69 is disposed between the luggage box 39 mounted on the body frame F under the seat 42 and the engine E, it is possible to prevent the position of the seat 42 from becoming higher in the case of ensuring the free motion of the cross-member 69 while avoiding the interference with the luggage box 39.  <br>
Since the opening portion 87 allowing the cushion side bracket 86 provided at the upper end of the rear cushion unit 33 to pass therethrough is provided in the frame main portion 24a of the rear portion of the main frame 21 of the body frame F; the cushion mounting portion 88 raised upwardly from the frame main portion 24a while crossing the opening portion 87 is mounted on the frame main portion 24a; and the cushion side bracket 86 is mounted on the cushion mounting portion 88, it is possible to set the cushion side bracket 86 at a high position, and hence to make larger the stroke of the rear cushion unit 33.  This makes it possible to improve the riding comfort.<br><br>
Since the sub-frame 22 constituting the body frame F in co-operation of the main frame 21 is fastened to the main frame 21 at a position near the connection portion between the cushion mounting portion 88 and the frame main portion 24a, it is possible to reinforce the strength of the cushion mounting portion 88 raised from the frame main portion 24a by the sub-frame 22.
