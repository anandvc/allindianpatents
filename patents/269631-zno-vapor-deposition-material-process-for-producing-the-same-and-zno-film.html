This application claims priority based on Japanese Patent Application Nos.<br>
2007-252759, 2007-252760, 2007-252761, 2007-252762, 2007-252763, 2007-252764,<br>

Application Nos. 2008-245299, 2008-245300, 2008-245301, 2008-245302, 2008-245303,<br>

enclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0002]<br>
In recent years, transparent conductive films have been indispensable when<br>
manufacturing photoelectric converters, such as solar cells and the like. As a known<br>
transparent conductive film, an ITO film (a tin-doped indium oxide film) is known. The<br>
ITO film has the advantages of excellent transparency and low resistance.<br>
[0003]<br>
Meanwhile, there has been a need for cost reduction in solar cells or liquid crystal<br>
displays. However, since indium is expensive, when the ITO film is used as a<br>
transparent conductive film, there is a disadvantage in that the solar cell also inevitably<br>
becomes expensive. In the case of manufacturing solar cells or the like, an amorphous<br>
silicon film is formed on a transparent conductive film by a plasma CVD method or the<br>
like. At this time, if the transparent conductive film is an ITO film, there is a problem<br>
in that hydrogen plasma at the time of plasma CVD leads to deterioration of the ITO<br>
film.<br>
[0004]<br>
In order to solve such problems, it has been proposed that a zinc oxide-based film<br>
doped with a conductive active element, such as Al, B, Si, Ga, or Sc, which can be<br>
prepared at low cost is used as a transparent conductive film for solar cells or the like,<br>
and a zinc oxide-based sputtering target is used to form the zinc oxide-based film by<br>
sputtering (for example, Patent Document 1). According to this zinc oxide-based<br>
sputtering target, an extremely low resistance zinc oxide-based sintered body is obtained<br>
by containing a predetermined amount of the conductive active element in zinc.<br>
Sintering density and conductivity of the sintered body are improved if the raw powder is<br>
fine and has high dispersibility.<br>
[Patent Document 1] Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
Technical Problem<br>
[0005]<br>
However, if sputtering is performed to form a film at high speed using the<br>
conventional zinc oxide-based sputtering target while applying high voltage, there are<br>
disadvantages in that abnormal discharge is likely to occur, the target is inhomogeneously<br>
consumed because of an unstable discharge state, compositional shift occurs in the<br>
resultant film, and it is difficult to obtain a low resistance film. On the other hand, if the<br>
voltage is decreased by decreasing power to be applied, there are disadvantages in that<br>
the speed of film formation is lowered and the efficiency of zinc oxide-based film<br>
formation is significantly reduced.<br>
[0006]<br>
Further, since the conventional target material has low evaporation efficiency and<br>
film formation efficiency, the lifespan of the target material replacement cycle is<br>
shortened, and there is a need for a target material having good evaporation efficiency<br>
and film formation efficiency so as to increase productivity. If the speed of film<br>
formation increases, film density is lowered, so the refractive index and sputtering<br>
resistance may be lowered, and discharge characteristics and insulation characteristics are<br>
deteriorated.<br>
[0007]<br>
The present invention has been completed in order to solve the above-described<br>
problems, and an object of the present invention is to provide a ZnO vapor deposition<br>
material capable of forming a film having high conductivity like an ITO film at high<br>
speed and forming a conductive film having excellent transparency and denseness, and a<br>
ZnO film using the ZnO vapor deposition material. Another object of the present<br>
invention is to provide a ZnO vapor deposition material capable of improving the speed<br>
of film formation with a large amount of evaporation per unit energy, and a ZnO film<br>
using the ZnO vapor deposition material.<br>
Technical Solution<br>
[0008]<br>
A first aspect of the present invention has the following configuration.<br>
[A1] A ZnO vapor deposition material for formation of a transparent conductive<br>
film which is composed of a porous ZnO sintered body containing Ce and Al, wherein<br>
the Ce content is higher than the Al content, the Ce content is in a range of 0.1 to 14.9%<br>
by mass, the Al content is in a range of 0.1 to 10% by mass, and the sintered body has a<br>
porosity of 3 to 50%.<br>
[A2] The ZnO vapor deposition material described in [Al], wherein the total<br>
content of Ce and Al is in a range of 0.2 to 15% by mass.<br>
[A3] The ZnO vapor deposition material described in [Al] or [A2], wherein the<br>
porous ZnO sintered body has pores having an average pore diameter of 0.1 to 500 µm.<br>
[A4] The ZnO vapor deposition material described in any one of [Al] to [A3],<br>
wherein the porous ZnO sintered body is a sintered body of grains having an average<br>
crystal grain size of 1 to 500 µm.<br>
[A5] The ZnO vapor deposition material described in any one of [Al] to [A4],<br>
wherein the porous ZnO sintered body is polycrystal or monocrystal.<br>
[0009]<br>
In the ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect, since the porous ZnO<br>
sintered body contains a predetermined amount of the two elements Ce and Al at a<br>
specific ratio, a ZnO film having high conductivity like an ITO film can be obtained by<br>
using the ZnO vapor deposition material. Preferably, the total content of Ce and Al is in<br>
a range of 0.2 to 15% by mass, so excellent effects in terms of conduction properties and<br>
spectroscopic properties are obtained.<br>
[0010]<br>
In the ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect, since the porous ZnO<br>
sintered body has a porosity of 3 to 50%, the specific surface area inside the vapor<br>
deposition material is large, and the evaporation speed of the vapor deposition material<br>
can be increased. Specifically, the evaporation speed can be 1.1 to 2 times higher than<br>
the conventional ZnO vapor deposition material.<br>
[0011]<br>
In the ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect, since the porous ZnO<br>
sintered body has pores having an average pore diameter of 0.1 to 500 µm, the<br>
evaporation speed can be increased. The porous ZnO sintered body is a sintered body<br>
of grains having an average crystal grain size of 1 to 500 (am, so the specific surface area<br>
inside the vapor deposition material increases, thereby increasing the evaporation speed<br>
of the vapor deposition material. The formed ZnO film has excellent film<br>
characteristics.<br>
[0012]<br>
In the ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect, the porous ZnO sintered body<br>
is polycrystal or monocrystal, and contains a predetermined amount of the two elements<br>
Ce and Al at a specific ratio, so a ZnO film having high conductivity like an ITO film can<br>
be obtained.<br>
[0013]<br>
Another aspect of the present invention provides a process for producing a ZnO<br>
vapor deposition material having the following configuration.<br>
[A6] A process for producing a ZnO vapor deposition material, the process<br>
including the steps of (I) mixing ZnO powder having a purity equal to or greater than<br>
98%, CeO2 powder in such an amount that the Ce content in the ZnO vapor deposition<br>
material is in a range of 0.1 to 14.9% by mass, Al2O3 powder in such an amount that the<br>
Al content in the ZnO vapor deposition material is in a range of 0.1 to 10% by mass, a<br>
binder, and an organic solvent to prepare a slurry with a concentration of 30 to 75% by<br>
mass, (II) blowing gas into the slurry to obtain a gas-containing slurry, (III) spray-drying<br>
the gas-containing slurry to obtain a porous granulation powder having an average grain<br>
size of 50 to 300 µm, (IV) molding the porous granulation powder to obtain a porous<br>
molded body, and (V) sintering the porous molded body at a predetermined temperature<br>
to obtain a porous ZnO sintered body.<br>
[0014]<br>
[A7] The process for producing a ZnO vapor deposition material of [A6]<br>
including, instead of the steps (II) and (III), the steps of (II-2) mixing a foaming agent in<br>
raw powder or slurry to obtain a foaming agent-containing slurry, and (III-2) foaming the<br>
foaming agent-containing slurry while spray-drying the foaming agent-containing slurry<br>
to obtain a porous granulation powder having an average grain size of 50 to 300 µm.<br>
[0015]<br>
[A8] The process for producing a ZnO vapor deposition material of [A6]<br>
including, instead of the steps (II) to (V), the steps of (II-3) mixing an additive, which<br>
will be volatized and dissolved at the time of calcination, in raw powder or slurry to<br>
obtain an additive-containing slurry, (III-3) spray-drying the additive-containing slurry to<br>
obtain a granulation powder having an average grain size of 50 to 300 urn, (IV-3)<br>
molding the granulation powder to obtain a molded body, and (V-3) sintering the molded<br>
body while volatizing and dissolving the additive to obtain a porous ZnO sintered body.<br>
[0016]<br>
[A9] The processes for producing a ZnO vapor deposition material of any one of<br>
[A6] to [A8], wherein in the step (I), ZnO powder having a purity equal to or greater than<br>
98%, an average grain size of 10 to 500 µm, and a grain size distribution within a range<br>
of ±10% of the average grain size, CeO2 powder, and Al2O3 powder are used, and the<br>
powders, a binder, and an organic solvent are mixed to prepare a slurry with a<br>
concentration of 30 to 75% by mass.<br>
[0017]<br>
In the process of this aspect, by the steps (I) to (V), a ZnO vapor deposition<br>
material having a large amount of evaporation, and having excellent film formation<br>
properties and denseness can be relatively easily produced. In particular, by the step (II)<br>
blowing gas into the slurry to obtain a gas-containing slurry, or (II-2) mixing a foaming<br>
agent in raw powder or slurry to obtain a foaming agent-containing slurry, a ZnO vapor<br>
deposition material having pores with predetermined porosity and average pore diameter,<br>
and an average crystal grain size can be relatively easily produced.<br>
[0018]<br>
In the process of this aspect, since the powder having an average grain size of 10<br>
to 500 µm and a grain size distribution within a range of+10% of the average grain size<br>
is used, fine grains do not substantially enter between grains, and thus a porous molded<br>
body having a porosity of 3 to 50% can be easily obtained.<br>
[0019]<br>
The present invention provides the following ZnO film and production of the<br>
same.<br>
[A10] A ZnO film which is formed using the ZnO vapor deposition material<br>
described in any one of [A1] to [A5], or a ZnO vapor deposition material produced by the<br>
process described in any one of [A6] to [A9].<br>
[A11] A ZnO film which is formed by an electron beam deposition method, an<br>
ion plating method, a sputtering method, or a plasma deposition method with the ZnO<br>
vapor deposition material described in any one of [A1] to [A5], or a ZnO vapor<br>
deposition material produced by the process described in any one of [A6] to [A9] as a<br>
target material.<br>
[A12] A process for forming a ZnO film by an electron beam deposition method,<br>
an ion plating method, a sputtering method, or a plasma deposition method with the ZnO<br>
vapor deposition material described in any one of [A1] to [A5], or a ZnO vapor<br>
deposition material produced by the process described in any one of [A6] to [A9] as a<br>
target material.<br>
[0020]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect can be widely used in a vacuum<br>
deposition method, such as an electron beam deposition method, an ion plating method, a<br>
sputtering method, or a plasma deposition method. By using the ZnO vapor deposition<br>
material of this aspect, for example, when a film is formed at the same speed of film<br>
formation as the related art by an electron beam deposition method, the filament<br>
replacement frequency can be reduced, and the speed of film formation can be increased,<br>
thereby shortening the production time.<br>
[0021]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect contains Ce and Al as additive<br>
elements, so crystals distorted by Ce having an ion radius greater than Zn are recovered<br>
and aligned by adding Al having a small ion radius. Thus, a ZnO film having high<br>
permeability is formed, such that a ZnO film having excellent denseness and high<br>
durability can be formed. A film having excellent moisture resistance and gas and<br>
vapor barrier properties can be obtained.<br>
[0022]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect has porosity within a<br>
predetermined range, and preferably, pores have an average pore diameter within a<br>
specific range, and grains have an average crystal grain size within a predetermined<br>
range, so the specific surface area inside the vapor deposition material increases, thereby<br>
increasing the evaporation speed. Thus, a ZnO film having good film formation<br>
efficiency can be formed. A ZnO film formed of the ZnO vapor deposition material of<br>
this aspect is dense, and has high conductivity and excellent durability.<br>
[0023]<br>
Another aspect of the present invention has the following configuration.<br>
[B1] A ZnO vapor deposition material for formation of a transparent conductive<br>
film which is composed of a porous ZnO sintered body containing Ce and Ga, wherein<br>
the Ce content is higher than the Ga content, the Ce content is in a range of 0.1 to 14.9%<br>
by mass, the Ga content is in a range of 0.1 to 10% by mass, and the sintered body has a<br>
porosity of 3 to 50%.<br>
[B2] The ZnO vapor deposition material described in [B1], wherein the total<br>
content of Ce and Ga is in a range of 0.2 to 15% by mass.<br>
[B3] The ZnO vapor deposition material described in [B1] or [B2], wherein the<br>
porous ZnO sintered body has pores having an average pore diameter of 0.1 to 500 urn.<br>
[B4] The ZnO vapor deposition material described in any one of [B1] to [B3],<br>
wherein the porous ZnO sintered body is a sintered body of grains having an average<br>
crystal grain size of 1 to 500 µm.<br>
[B5] The ZnO vapor deposition material described in any one of [B1] to [B4],<br>
wherein the porous ZnO sintered body is poly crystal or monocrystal.<br>
[0024]<br>
In the ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect, the porous ZnO sintered body<br>
contains a predetermined amount of the two elements Ce and Ga at a specific ratio, so a<br>
ZnO film having high conductivity like an ITO film can be obtained by using the ZnO<br>
vapor deposition material. Preferably, the total content of Ce and Ga is in a range of 0.2<br>
to 15% by mass, so excellent effects in terms of conduction properties and spectroscopic<br>
properties are obtained.<br>
[0025]<br>
In the ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect, since the porous ZnO<br>
sintered body has a porosity of 3 to 50%, the specific surface area inside the vapor<br>
deposition material is large, and the evaporation speed of the vapor deposition material<br>
can be increased. Specifically, the evaporation speed can be 1.1 to 2 times higher than<br>
the conventional ZnO vapor deposition material.<br>
[0026]<br>
In the ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect, since the porous ZnO<br>
sintered body has pores having an average pore diameter of 0.1 to 500 µm, the<br>
evaporation speed can be increased. The porous ZnO sintered body is a sintered body<br>
of grains having an average crystal grain size of 1 to 500 µm, so the specific surface area<br>
inside the vapor deposition material increases, thereby increasing the evaporation speed<br>
of the vapor deposition material. The formed ZnO film has excellent film<br>
characteristics.<br>
[0027]<br>
In the ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect, the porous ZnO sintered body<br>
is polycrystal or monocrystal, and contains a predetermined amount of the two elements<br>
Ce and Ga at a specific ratio, so a ZnO film having high conductivity like an ITO film<br>
can be obtained.<br>

of ±10% of the average grain size, CeO2 powder, and Ga2O3 powder are used, and the<br>
powders, a binder, and an organic solvent are mixed to prepare a slurry with a<br>
concentration of 30 to 75% by mass.<br>
[0032]<br>
In the process of this aspect, by the steps (I) to (V), a ZnO vapor deposition<br>
material having a large amount of evaporation, and having excellent film formation<br>
properties and denseness can be relatively easily produced. In particular, by the step (II)<br>

body while volatizing and dissolving the additive to obtain a porous ZnO sintered body.<br>
[0118]<br>
[H9] The process for producing a ZnO vapor deposition material of any one of<br>
[H6] to [H8], wherein in the step (I), ZnO powder having a purity equal to or greater than<br>
98%, an average grain size of 10 to 500 µm, and a grain size distribution within a range<br>
of ±10% of the average grain size, and oxide powder of the additive element are used,<br>
and the powders, a binder, and an organic solvent are mixed to prepare a slurry with a<br>
concentration of 30 to 75% by mass.<br>
[0119]<br>
In the process of this aspect, by the steps (I) to (V), a ZnO vapor deposition<br>
material having a large amount of evaporation, and having excellent film formation<br>
properties and denseness can be relatively easily produced. In particular, by the step (II)<br>
blowing gas into the slurry to obtain a gas-containing slurry, or (II-2) mixing a foaming<br>
agent in raw powder or slurry to obtain a foaming agent-containing slurry, a ZnO vapor<br>
deposition material having pores with predetermined porosity and average pore diameter,<br>
and an average crystal grain size can be relatively easily produced.<br>
[0120]<br>
In the process of this aspect, since the powder having an average grain size of 10<br>
to 500 µm and a grain size distribution within a range of ±10% of the average grain size<br>
is used, fine grains do not substantially enter between grains, and thus a porous molded<br>
body having a porosity of 3 to 50% can be easily obtained.<br>
[0121]<br>
The present invention provides the following ZnO film and production of the<br>
same.<br>
[H10] A ZnO film which is formed using the ZnO vapor deposition material<br>
described in any one of [H1] to [H5], or a ZnO vapor deposition material produced by the<br>
process described in any one of [H6] to [H9].<br>
[H11] A ZnO film which is formed by an electron beam deposition method, an<br>
ion plating method, a sputtering method, or a plasma deposition method with the ZnO<br>
vapor deposition material described in any one of [H1] to [H5], or a ZnO vapor<br>
deposition material produced by the process described in any one of [H6] to [H9] as a<br>
target material.<br>
[H12] A process for forming a ZnO film by an electron beam deposition method,<br>
an ion plating method, a sputtering method, or a plasma deposition method with the ZnO<br>
vapor deposition material described in any one of [H1] to [H5], or a ZnO vapor<br>
deposition material produced by the process described in any one of [H6] to [H9] as a<br>
target material.<br>
[0122]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect can be widely used in a vacuum<br>
deposition method, such as an electron beam deposition method, an ion plating method, a<br>
sputtering method, or a plasma deposition method. By using the ZnO vapor deposition<br>
material of this aspect, for example, when a film is formed at the same speed of film<br>
formation as the related art by an electron beam deposition method, the filament<br>
replacement frequency can be reduced, and the speed of film formation can be increased,<br>
thereby shortening the production time.<br>
[0123]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect is composed of the ZnO<br>
sintered body having a ZnO purity equal to or greater than 98%, and the sintered body<br>
contains one or more additive elements selected from the group consisting of Y, La, Sc,<br>
Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm, and Sm, so a ZnO film having good conductivity over a wide<br>
temperature range can be obtained by using the ZnO vapor deposition material.<br>
In the ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect, since the ZnO sintered body<br>
contains the additive element(s), regardless of polycrystal or monocrystal, a ZnO film<br>
having good conductivity over a wide temperature range can be obtained. Further, a<br>
film having excellent moisture resistance, and gas and vapor barrier properties can be<br>
obtained.<br>
[0124]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect has porosity within a<br>
predetermined range, and preferably, pores have an average pore diameter within a<br>
specific range, and grains have an average crystal grain size within a predetermined<br>
range, so the specific surface area inside the vapor deposition material increases, thereby<br>
increasing the evaporation speed. Thus, a ZnO film having good film formation<br>
efficiency can be formed. A ZnO film formed of the ZnO vapor deposition material of<br>
this aspect is dense, and has high conductivity and excellent durability.<br>
ADVANTAGEOUS EFFECTS<br>
[0125]<br>
According to the present invention, a ZnO film having high permeability,<br>
excellent denseness, and high durability can be formed. Further, a film having excellent<br>
moisture resistance, and gas and vapor barrier properties can be obtained.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[0126]<br>
Hereinafter, an aspect of the present invention will be described specifically.<br>
[ZnO vapor deposition material]<br>
A ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect is a ZnO vapor deposition<br>
material for formation of a transparent conductive film which is composed mainly of a<br>
porous ZnO sintered body containing Ce and Al, wherein the Ce content is higher than<br>
the Al content, the Ce content is in a range of 0.1 to 14.9% by mass, the Al content is in a<br>
range of 0.1 to 10% by mass, and the sintered body has a porosity of 3 to 50%.<br>
[0127]<br>
The inventors have investigated in detail the effect on conductivity due to<br>
additive species and its content in a ZnO vapor deposition material and a ZnO film<br>
formed by using the vapor deposition material, and have found that there is a significant<br>
level of influence due to the content ratio of the two elements of Ce and Al as the<br>
additive elements in the porous ZnO sintered body. Based on the above-described<br>
knowledge, the ZnO vapor deposition material according to this aspect contains ZnO as a<br>
major component, and also contains both elements of Ce and Al, such that excess<br>
electrons contributing to conduction are developed in large amounts and maintained,<br>
thereby forming a ZnO film having high conductivity.<br>
[0128]<br>
As the ratio of the two elements of Ce and Al in the porous ZnO sintered body<br>
increases within a predetermined range, the conductivity of the ZnO film becomes better,<br>
and if the ratio is outside the range, the conductivity adversely deteriorates. Specifically,<br>
the Ce content in the ZnO vapor deposition material is appropriately in a range of 0.1 to<br>
14.9% by mass, and preferably, in a range of 3 to 6% by mass. If the Ce content is<br>
lower than the lower limit value, 0.1% by mass, the conductivity is significantly lowered.<br>
If the Ce content exceeds the upper limit value, 14.9% by mass, the permeability is<br>
significantly lowered.<br>
[0129]<br>
The Al content in the ZnO vapor deposition material is appropriately in a range of<br>
0.1 to 10% by mass, and preferably, in a range of 1 to 3% by mass. If the Al content is<br>
lower than the lower limit value, 0.1 % by mass, the conductivity is significantly lowered.<br>
If the Al content exceeds the upper limit value, 10% by mass, compositional shift at the<br>
time of deposition occurs.<br>
[0130]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect contains a larger amount of Ce<br>
than Al, such that a dense crystal structure is maintained. If the Ce content is lower than<br>
the Al content, the conductivity and permeability are lowered. The total content of Ce<br>
and Al is preferably in a range of 0.2 to 15% by mass. If the total content of Ce and Al<br>
exceeds this range, the specific resistance and permeability of the ZnO vapor deposition<br>
material are significantly lowered.<br>
[0131]<br>
When a very small amount of Ce and Al is contained in the ZnO vapor deposition<br>
material, Ce and Al do not exist as granular precipitates in grain boundaries or grains in<br>
the ZnO matrix but are uniformly dispersed in the ZnO vapor deposition material. It is<br>
considered that, in the ZnO vapor deposition material, Ce is present as an oxide, such as<br>
CeO2 or Ce2O3, and Al is present as Al2O3.<br>
[0132]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect contains Ce, which is a trivalent<br>
or quadrivalent rare earth element, as an additive element, and Ce causes excess carrier<br>
electrons to be generated with respect to divalent Zn, such that high conductivity can be<br>
ensured. When a rare earth element is added to the ZnO vapor deposition material,<br>
compositional shift at the time of deposition is unlikely to occur, and a desired<br>
composition ratio can be maintained when a film is formed.<br>
[0133]<br>
According to the ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect, the conductivity is<br>
obtained by oxygen defect as well as compulsive injection of carrier electrons. Usually,<br>
oxygen gas is introduced in a vapor deposition method, but generally oxygen in the film<br>
composition is insufficient. At the time of transparent conductive film formation, a<br>
technique is conventionally used in which resistance is lowered by generating oxygen<br>
defect. However, in the case of adding a rare earth element, it is easy to control because<br>
the element is excellent in evaporation performance. In addition to this advantage, since<br>
the ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect contains Al as an additive element, high<br>
conductivity like ITO can be obtained.<br>
[0134]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect is composed of a porous ZnO<br>
sintered body having a porosity of 3 to 50%. The porosity of the sintered body is<br>
appropriately in a range of 3 to 50%, preferably in a range of 5 to 30%), more preferably<br>
in a range of 10 to 30%&gt;, and still more preferably in a range of 20 to 30%. If the<br>
porosity is smaller than 3%, it is not preferable since, at the time of film formation by an<br>
electron beam deposition method or an ion plating method, the evaporation speed of the<br>
vapor deposition material does not increase, and as a result, the speed of film formation<br>
decreases, which results in an increase in manufacturing costs. If the porosity exceeds<br>
50%, the strength of the porous sintered body is lowered, and it is difficult to obtain<br>
sufficient mechanical strength. If the porosity is equal to or greater than 10%, the<br>
evaporation speed can be improved. Further, if the porosity is equal to or greater than<br>
20%, a vapor deposition material having an evaporation speed about 2.0 times higher<br>
than the conventional ZnO vapor deposition material can be obtained.<br>
[0135]<br>
In the porous ZnO sintered body of this aspect, the pores preferably have an<br>
average pore diameter of 0.1 to 500 urn. If the average pore diameter of the pores is<br>
within the above-described range, the evaporation speed can be further increased. If the<br>
pore diameter is smaller than 0.1 µm, there is no merit in the pores. If the pore diameter<br>
exceeds 500 µm, it is not preferable because the strength of the sintered body is lowered,<br>
which causes damages due to EB (electron beam) irradiation, that is, splash.<br>
[0136]<br>
The term "pore diameter" (the inner diameter of the pore) refers to, for example,<br>
the maximum value of the internal dimensions in the pores when the sectional portion of<br>
the vapor deposition material is observed by observation means, such as SEM or the like.<br>
As the evaluation method of the pores, measurement of porosity by a substitution method,<br>
measurement of porosity by microscopy, measurement of surface area and micropore<br>
distribution by gas absorption, measurement of surface area and micropore distribution<br>
by a mercury intrusion method, measurement of surface area by a gas permeation method,<br>
or measurement of micropore distribution by an X-ray small-angle scattering method<br>
may be used.<br>
[0137]<br>
The pores are preferably rounded, and in terms of improvement in the<br>
evaporation speed, micropores are preferably formed at the surface of the pores. For the<br>
evaluation method of the pores, the surface area is preferably in a range of 5 to 40 m /g,<br>
and at least one peak of the micropore distribution is present within a range of 1 to 100<br>
urn. Portions (frame portion) other than the pores are preferably substantially sintered.<br>
For example, the frame portion of the porous sintered body preferably has a density equal<br>
to or greater than 98%.<br>
[0138]<br>
In the porous ZnO sintered body of this aspect, it is preferable that grains<br>
preferably have an average crystal grain size of 1 to 500 µm, and rounded pores of about<br>
0.1 to 500 urn are provided in the sintered body. The porous ZnO sintered body has a<br>
fine crystal structure in which the average crystal grain size is within the above-described<br>
range, and the occurrence of defects in the boundary of crystal grains can be reduced.<br>
Thus, the formed ZnO film has excellent film characteristics, such as ZnO film density,<br>
thickness distribution, refractive index, sputtering resistance, discharge characteristics<br>
(discharge voltage, discharge responsiveness, and the like), insulation characteristics, and<br>
the like. If the average crystal grain size is smaller than 1 µm, the speed of film<br>
formation is lowered. If the average crystal grain size exceeds 500 µm, the deposition<br>
rate of the additive element is not uniform. The average crystal grain size is preferably<br>
in a range of 5 to 40 µm, and more preferably, in a range of 10 to 30 urn.<br>
[0139]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect is preferably molded in the<br>
form of disc-like or circular pellets. When the vapor deposition material has a circular<br>
shape, the diameter of the vapor deposition material is appropriately in a range of 5 to 30<br>
mm, and preferably, in a range of 5 to 15 mm. This is because, if the diameter is<br>
excessively small and smaller than 5 mm, splash occurs, and if the diameter exceeds 30<br>
mm, it is difficult to handle the vapor deposition material in an actual production process.<br>
When the vapor deposition material is disc-like, the diameter of the vapor deposition<br>
material is appropriately in a range of 5 to 20 mm, and preferably, in a range of 5 to 10<br>
mm. The height of the vapor deposition material is in a range of 1 to 10 mm, and<br>
preferably, in a range of 2 to 5 mm. This is because, if the diameter is excessively small<br>
and smaller than 5 mm or the height is excessively small and smaller than 1 mm, splash<br>
occurs, and if the diameter exceeds 30 mm or the height exceeds 10 mm, it is difficult to<br>
handle the vapor deposition material in an actual production process.<br>
[0140]<br>
Hereinafter, a process for producing a ZnO vapor deposition material according<br>
to this aspect will be described.<br>
[Production Process]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material according to this aspect can be produced by<br>
mixing ZnO powder having a purity equal to or greater than 98%, CeO2 powder in such<br>
an amount that the Ce content in the ZnO vapor deposition material is in a range of 0.1 to<br>
14.9% by mass, Al2O3 powder in such an amount that the Al content in the ZnO vapor<br>
deposition material is in a range of 0.1 to 10% by mass, a binder, and an organic solvent<br>
to prepare a slurry with a concentration of 30 to 75% by mass, spray-drying the slurry to<br>
obtain a granulation powder having an average grain size of 50 to 300 urn, molding the<br>
granulation powder to obtain a porous molded body, and sintering the molded body at a<br>
predetermined temperature to obtain a porous ZnO sintered body.<br>
[0141]<br>
The ZnO powder preferably has purity equal to or greater than 98%, and more<br>
preferably, equal to or greater than 98.4%. If the ZnO powder has purity equal to or<br>
greater than 98%, reduction of conductivity by the effect of impurities can be suppressed.<br>
The average grain size of the ZnO powder is in a range of 0.1 to 10 µm. When the<br>
average grain size of the ZnO powder is smaller than 0.1 µm, the powder is excessively<br>
fine and aggregated, so there is a tendency that the handling of the powder becomes<br>
worse, and it is difficult to prepare a high-concentration slurry. When the average grain<br>
size exceeds 10 µm, there is a tendency that it is difficult to control the micro-structure,<br>
and a dense pellet is hard to obtain. If the average grain size of the ZnO powder is<br>
adjusted to the above-described range, a desired sintered body is also obtained without<br>
using a sintering auxiliary agent.<br>
[0142]<br>
With regard to the CeO2 powder, considering the prevention of maldistribution of<br>
the Ce powder, reactivity with the ZnO matrix, and the purity of the Ce compound, it is<br>
preferable to add cerium oxide grains whose primary grain size is of a nanometer scale.<br>
The Al2O3 powder preferably has an average grain size of 0.01 to 1 µm, and still more<br>
preferably, the average grain size is in a range of 0.05 to 0.5 µm. If the Al2O3 powder<br>
having this average grain size is used, it is beneficial in terms of the uniform dispersion<br>
of the CeO2 powder.<br>
[0143]<br>
For a binder, polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl butyral, or the like may be used. It<br>
is preferable to add the binder at 0.2 to 2.5% by mass. For an organic solvent, ethanol,<br>
propanol, or the like may be used.<br>
[0144]<br>
The raw powder, the binder, and the organic solvent are mixed to prepare a slurry<br>
with a concentration of 30 to 75% by mass, and preferably, 40 to 65% by mass. If the<br>
slurry concentration exceeds 75% by mass, since the slurry is a non-aqueous system,<br>
stable granulation is difficult. If the slurry concentration is less than 30% by mass, it is<br>
difficult to obtain a dense ZnO sintered body having a uniform composition. If the<br>
slurry concentration is adjusted within the above-described range, the viscosity of the<br>
slurry is in a range of 200 to 1000 cps. Therefore, powder granulation using a spray<br>
drier can be performed stably. Further, the density of a molded body increases, such<br>
that a dense sintered body can be obtained.<br>
[0145]<br>
Wet blending of raw powder, a binder, and an organic solvent, and in particular,<br>
wet blending of raw powder and an organic solvent as a dispersion medium is preferably<br>
performed by a wet ball mill or a stirring mill. In the case of using a ZrO2 ball in the<br>
wet ball mill, wet blending is preferably performed using a large number of ZrO2 balls<br>
having a diameter of 5 to 10 mm for 8 to 24 hours, and preferably, for 20 to 24 hours. If<br>
the diameter of the ZrO2 ball is smaller than 5 mm, blending may be insufficient. If the<br>
diameter of the ZrO2 ball exceeds 10 mm, impurities are increased. Even though the<br>
blending time is long, up to 24 hours, impurities are hardly generated due to milling.<br>
On the other hand, when a resin ball with a metal support is used in the wet ball mill, a<br>
ball having a diameter of 10 to 15 mm is preferably used.<br>
[0146]<br>
In the stirring mill, wet blending is preferably performed using a ZrO2 ball having<br>
a diameter of 1 to 3 mm for 0.5 to 1 hour. If the diameter of the ZrO2 ball is smaller<br>
than 1 mm, blending is insufficient. If the diameter exceeds 3 mm, impurities are<br>
increased. If the blending time exceeds 1 hour, while raw materials are mixed, milling<br>
leads to the generation of impurities. Sufficient blending can be done within 1 hour.<br>
Blending/granulation of powder and additives may be performed by a general tumbling<br>
granulation method. In this case, it is not necessary to perform a separation operation<br>
from the balls or the like after the process, and thus the process is simplified.<br>
[0147]<br>
In the production process of this aspect, as a first step for obtaining a porous<br>
sintered body, gas is blown and mixed into the slurry to prepare a gas-containing slurry.<br>
Gas blowing and mixing is preferably performed by blowing using a mechanical pump,<br>
gas pressure, or the like. As the gas, air, an insoluble gas, a non-aqueous gas, or the like<br>
may be used.<br>
[0148]<br>
The gas-containing slurry is spray-dried. The spray drying is preferably<br>
performed at 150 to 250°C for 3 hours by using a spray drier. Since gas is blown into<br>
the slurry, the granulation powder obtained by spray-drying the slurry is porous.<br>
Through the spray drying, a porous granulation powder having an average grain size of<br>
50 to 300 µm can be obtained.<br>
[0149]<br>
In the production process of this aspect, as a second step for obtaining a porous<br>
sintered body, a slurry is prepared in which a foaming agent is mixed. For the foaming<br>
agent, an organic foaming agent or an inorganic foaming agent may be used. For the<br>
organic foaming agent, azodicarboxylamide, dinitrosobenta methylene tetramine, or the<br>
like is used, and for the inorganic foaming agent, carbonate or the like is used. The<br>
foaming agent may be mixed with ZnO powder, CeO2 powder, and Al2O3 powder, or may<br>
be added upon slurry preparation.<br>
[0150]<br>
The foaming agent-containing slurry is spray-dried. The spray drying is<br>
preferably performed at 150 to 250°C for 3 hours by using a spray drier. The foaming<br>
agent contained in the slurry is foamed and dissolved upon this spray drying, such that<br>
resultant granulation powder is made porous. Through the spray drying, a porous<br>
granulation powder having an average grain size of 50 to 300 µm can be obtained.<br>
[0151]<br>
In the production process of this aspect, as a third step for obtaining a porous<br>
sintered body, a slurry is prepared in which an additive, which will be volatized and<br>
dissolved upon sintering, is mixed. Examples of the additive include butyral capable of<br>
being dissolved in a solvent, and a cellulose-based additive, a polyvinyl-based additive, a<br>
polyester-based additive, a polyethylene-based additive, and the like capable of being<br>
dissolved in an alcohol-based solvent. Examples of the additive which will not be<br>
dissolved in the alcohol-based solvent include a starch-based additive and a<br>
polystyrene-based additive having an average grain size of about several µm to 500 µm.<br>
It is preferable that butyral is mixed in the slurry at about 20% by mass, or starch is<br>
mixed in the slurry at about 20% by mass.<br>
[0152]<br>
If the slurry contains the additive, the additive is volatized and dissolved upon<br>
sintering to form pores, thereby obtaining a porous sintered body. The diameter and<br>
shape of the pores can be controlled by adjusting the kind and amount of the additive.<br>
For example, when a butyral-based additive is used, pores having a pore diameter of 0.1<br>
µm to 10 µm order can be formed. When starch is used, pores having the same pore<br>
diameter as the grain size of starch and the same shape as starch can be formed. Thus,<br>
when starch is used, the pore diameter and shape of the pores can be more easily<br>
controlled.<br>
[0153]<br>
Specifically, in the case of the ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect, a<br>
vapor deposition material using a butyral-based additive can obtain a deposition speed<br>
about 1.3 times higher than the evaporation speed of the conventional ZnO vapor<br>
deposition material having relative density equal to or greater than about 98%, and a<br>
vapor deposition material using starch having an average grain size of 0.1 to 500 urn can<br>
obtain an evaporation speed about two times higher than the evaporation speed of the<br>
conventional ZnO vapor deposition material having relative density equal to or greater<br>
than about 98%. Therefore, a high speed of film formation can be obtained.<br>
[0154]<br>
In the production process of this aspect, as a fourth step for obtaining a porous<br>
sintered body, a slurry using ZnO powder having a grain size distribution within a<br>
predetermined range is prepared. Specifically, ZnO powder having an average grain<br>
size of 10 to 500 µm and a grain size distribution within a range of ±10% of the average<br>
grain size is used. If the grain size distribution of ZnO powder is outside the range of<br>
±10% of the average grain size, the porosity is lowered. More preferably, the grain size<br>
distribution is within a range of ±5% of the average grain size. The preferred grain size<br>
of CeO2 powder and Al2O3 powder is significantly smaller than that of ZnO powder, and<br>
the usage is smaller than that of ZnO powder, so CeO2 powder and Al2O3 powder may be<br>
outside the limitation of the grain size distribution.<br>
[0155]<br>
The slurry using ZnO powder with a controlled grain size distribution is<br>
spray-dried. The spray drying is preferably performed at 150 to 250°C for 3 hours by<br>
using a spray drier. In the slurry to be spray-dried, ZnO powder having an average<br>
grain size of 10 to 500 urn and a grain size distribution within a range of ±10% of the<br>
average grain size is used, and no fine ZnO powder is substantially contained. Thus,<br>
there are no cases where fine ZnO grains fill the gaps between ZnO grains, so the gaps<br>
between ZnO grains remain as pores, and granulation powder becomes porous.<br>
Through the spray drying, a porous granulation powder having an average grain size of<br>
50 to 300 µm can be obtained.<br>
[0156]<br>
After the slurry is spray-dried to obtain a granulation powder having an average<br>
grain size of 50 to 300 µm, the granulation powder is molded under a predetermined<br>
pressure. If the average grain size of the granulation powder is smaller than 50 µm,<br>
moldability deteriorates, and if the average grain size is larger than 300 µm, the density<br>
of the molded body is lowered, and the strength is likely to be insufficient.<br>
[0157]<br>
For a pressing molding device, a uniaxial press device, a cold isostatic press<br>
(CIP) molding device, or other devices may be used. The molding pressure is<br>
appropriately in a range of 100 to 2000 kgf/cm2 (9.8 to 196 MPa), and preferably, 100 to<br>
1000 kgf/cm (9.8 to 98 MPa). Molding is performed under pressure within the<br>
above-described range, such that the density of the molded body can be increased,<br>
deformation after sintering can be suppressed, and postprocessing is not required.<br>
[0158]<br>
Next, the molded body is sintered. Before sintering, the molded body is<br>
preferably degreased at a temperature of 350 to 620°C. Through this degreasing, spots<br>
on the molded body after sintering can be suppressed. The degreasing is preferably<br>
performed for a sufficient time.<br>
[0159]<br>
Sintering is performed in an atmosphere of air, an inactive gas, a vacuum, or a<br>
reductive gas at a temperature equal to or higher than 1000°C, and preferably, at a<br>
temperature of 1200 to 1400°C for 1 to 10 hours, and preferably, for 2 to 5 hours. The<br>
sintering is performed under air pressure, but in the case of pressure sintering, such as hot<br>
press (HP) sintering or hot isostatic press (HIP) sintering, the sintering is preferably<br>
performed in an atmosphere of inactive gas, vacuum, or reductive gas at a temperature<br>
equal to or higher than 1000°C for 1 to 5 hours.<br>
[0160]<br>
A ZnO film is formed on the surface of the substrate by a vacuum film formation<br>
method with a ZnO vapor deposition material composed of the resultant porous sintered<br>
body as a target material. As the vacuum film formation method suitable for forming a<br>
film using the ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect, an electron beam deposition<br>
method, an ion plating method, a sputtering method, or a plasma deposition method may<br>
be used. A ZnO film of this aspect formed by the film formation method uses the ZnO<br>
vapor deposition material of this aspect, so the ZnO film has high conductivity with<br>
specific resistance of 3 to 5x10-4 O cm and high permeability with visible light<br>
permeability equal to or greater than 90%, like ITO. Crystals distorted by Ce having an<br>
ion radius larger than Zn are recovered and aligned by adding Al having a small ion<br>
radius, such that the durability of the film is improved.<br>
[0161]<br>
According to the production process of this aspect, in any of the first step of<br>
mixing gas in the slurry, the second step of preparing the foaming agent-containing slurry,<br>
the third step of preparing the slurry containing the additive which will be volatized and<br>
dissolved upon sintering, and the fourth step of preparing the slurry using ZnO powder<br>
having a grain size distribution within a predetermined range, the porosity, pore diameter,<br>
and pore shape can be easily controlled. Therefore, a vapor deposition material having<br>
optimum pores can be produced. As a result, even when a large number of pore states<br>
are required by the production conditions or the like, an optimum vapor deposition<br>
material can be provided to cope with the requirements.<br>
[0162]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect is composed mainly of a porous<br>
sintered body having a porosity of 5 to 30% and a pore diameter of 0.1 to 500 µm, so<br>
when a ZnO transparent conductive film is formed by an electron beam deposition<br>
method or an ion plating method using the ZnO vapor deposition material, the<br>
evaporation speed can be improved. That is, when film formation is performed with the<br>
same electron beam energy, the speed of film formation increases, and the operation time<br>
is shortened, thereby increasing the number of products for a predetermined time.<br>
Further, when film formation is performed at the same film formation speed, electron<br>
beam energy is reduced, and the replacement timing of a filament of an electron gun or<br>
the like is delayed, such that the number of times of maintenance is reduced and<br>
productivity is improved. As a result, manufacturing costs can be reduced.<br>
[0163]<br>
Next, another aspect of the present invention will be described.<br>
[ZnO vapor deposition material]<br>
A ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect is a ZnO vapor deposition<br>
material for formation of a transparent conductive film which is composed mainly of a<br>
porous ZnO sintered body containing Ce and Ga, wherein the Ce content is higher than<br>
the Ga content, the Ce content is in a range of 0.1 to 14.9% by mass, the Ga content is in<br>
a range of 0.1 to 10% by mass, and the sintered body has a porosity of 3 to 50%.<br>
[0164]<br>
The inventors have investigated in detail the effect on conductivity due to<br>
additive species and its content in a ZnO vapor deposition material and a ZnO film<br>
formed by using the vapor deposition material, and have found that there is a significant<br>
level of influence due to the content ratio of the two elements of Ce and Ga as the<br>
additive elements in the porous ZnO sintered body. Based on the above-described<br>
knowledge, the ZnO vapor deposition material according to this aspect contains ZnO as a<br>
major component, and also contains both elements of Ce and Ga, such that excess<br>
electrons contributing to conduction are developed in large amounts and maintained,<br>
thereby forming a ZnO film having high conductivity.<br>
[0165]<br>
As the ratio of the two elements of Ce and Ga in the porous ZnO sintered body<br>
increases within a predetermined range, the conductivity of the ZnO film becomes better,<br>
and if the ratio is outside the range, the conductivity adversely deteriorates. Specifically,<br>
the Ce content in the ZnO vapor deposition material is appropriately in a range of 0.1 to<br>
14.9% by mass, and preferably, in a range of 3 to 6% by mass. If the Ce content is<br>
lower than the lower limit value, 0.1% by mass, the conductivity is significantly lowered.<br>
If the Ce content exceeds the upper limit value, 14.9% by mass, the permeability is<br>
significantly lowered.<br>
[0166]<br>
The Ga content in the ZnO vapor deposition material is appropriately in a range<br>
of 0.1 to 10% by mass, and preferably, in a range of 1 to 3% by mass. If the Ga content<br>
is lower than the lower limit value, 0.1% by mass, the conductivity is significantly<br>
lowered. If the Ga content exceeds the upper limit value, 10% by mass, compositional<br>
shift at the time of deposition occurs.<br>
[0167]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect contains a larger amount of Ce<br>
than Ga, such that a dense crystal structure is maintained. If the Ce content is lower<br>
than the Ga content, the conductivity and permeability are lowered. The total content of<br>
Ce and Ga is preferably in a range of 0.2 to 15% by mass. If the total content of Ce and<br>
Ga exceeds this range, the specific resistance and permeability of the ZnO vapor<br>
deposition material are significantly lowered.<br>
[0168]<br>
When a very small amount of Ce and Ga is contained in the ZnO vapor<br>
deposition material, Ce and Ga do not exist as granular precipitates in grain boundaries or<br>
grains in the ZnO matrix but are uniformly dispersed in the ZnO vapor deposition<br>
material. It is considered that, in the ZnO vapor deposition material, Ce is present as an<br>
oxide, such as CeO2 or Ce2O3, and Ga is present as Ga2O3.<br>
[0169]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect contains Ce, which is a trivalent<br>
or quadrivalent rare earth element, as an additive element, and Ce causes excess carrier<br>
electrons to be generated with respect to divalent Zn, such that high conductivity can be<br>
ensured. When a rare earth element is added to the ZnO vapor deposition material,<br>
compositional shift at the time of deposition is unlikely to occur, and a desired<br>
composition ratio can be maintained when a film is formed.<br>
[0170]<br>
According to the ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect, the conductivity is<br>
obtained by oxygen defect as well as compulsive injection of carrier electrons. Usually,<br>
oxygen gas is introduced in a vapor deposition method, but generally oxygen in the film<br>
composition is insufficient. At the time of transparent conductive film formation, a<br>
technique is conventionally used in which resistance is lowered by generating oxygen<br>
defect. However, in the case of adding a rare earth element, it is easy to control because<br>
the element is excellent in evaporation performance. In addition to this advantage, since<br>
the ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect contains Ga as an additive element, high<br>
conductivity like ITO can be obtained.<br>
[0171]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect is composed of a porous ZnO<br>
sintered body having a porosity of 3 to 50%. The porosity of the sintered body is<br>
appropriately in a range of 3 to 50%, preferably in a range of 5 to 30%, more preferably<br>
in a range of 10 to 30%, and still more preferably in a range of 20 to 30%. If the<br>
porosity is smaller than 3%, it is not preferable since, at the time of film formation by an<br>
electron beam deposition method or an ion plating method, the evaporation speed of the<br>
vapor deposition material does not increase, and as a result, the speed of film formation<br>
decreases, which results in an increase in manufacturing costs. If the porosity exceeds<br>
50%, the strength of the porous sintered body is lowered, and it is difficult to obtain<br>
sufficient mechanical strength. If the porosity is equal to or greater than 10%, the<br>
evaporation speed can be improved. Further, if the porosity is equal to or greater than<br>
20%, a vapor deposition material having an evaporation speed about two times higher<br>
than the conventional ZnO vapor deposition material can be obtained.<br>
[0172]<br>
In the porous ZnO sintered body of this aspect, the pores preferably have an<br>
average pore diameter of 0.1 to 500 µm. If the average pore diameter of the pores is<br>
within the above-described range, the evaporation speed can be further increased. If the<br>
pore diameter is smaller than 0.1 µm, there is no merit in the pores. If the pore diameter<br>
exceeds 500 µm, it is not preferable because the strength of the sintered body is lowered,<br>
which causes damages due to EB (electron beam) irradiation, that is, splash.<br>
[0173]<br>
The term "pore diameter" (the inner diameter of the pore) refers to, for example,<br>
the maximum value of the internal dimensions in the pores when the sectional portion of<br>
the vapor deposition material is observed by observation means, such as SEM or the like.<br>
As the evaluation method of the pores, measurement of porosity by a substitution method,<br>
measurement of porosity by microscopy, measurement of surface area and micropore<br>
distribution by gas absorption, measurement of surface area and micropore distribution<br>
by a mercury intrusion method, measurement of surface area by a gas permeation method,<br>
or measurement of micropore distribution by an X-ray small-angle scattering method<br>
may be used.<br>
[0174]<br>
The pores are preferably rounded, and in terms of improvement in the<br>
evaporation speed, micropores are preferably formed at the surface of the pores. For the<br>
evaluation method of the pores, the surface area is preferably in a range of 5 to 40 m /g,<br>
and at least one peak of the micropore distribution is present within a range of 1 to 100 µm. Portions (frame portion) other than the pores are preferably substantially sintered.<br>
For example, the frame portion of the porous sintered body preferably has a density equal<br>
to or greater than 98%.<br>
[0175]<br>
In the porous ZnO sintered body of this aspect, it is preferable that grains<br>
preferably have an average crystal grain size of 1 to 500 µm, and rounded pores of about<br>
0.1 to 500 µm are provided in the sintered body. The porous ZnO sintered body has a<br>
fine crystal structure in which the average crystal grain size is within the above-described<br>
range, and the occurrence of defects in the boundary of crystal grains can be reduced.<br>
Thus, the formed ZnO film has excellent film characteristics, such as ZnO film density,<br>
thickness distribution, refractive index, sputtering resistance, discharge characteristics<br>
(discharge voltage, discharge responsiveness, and the like), insulation characteristics, and<br>
the like. If the average crystal grain size is smaller than 1 µm, the speed of film<br>
formation is lowered. If the average crystal grain size exceeds 500 µm, the deposition<br>
rate of the additive element is not uniform. The average crystal grain size is preferably<br>
in a range of 5 to 40 µm, and more preferably, in a range of 10 to 30 µm.<br>
[0176]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect is preferably molded in the<br>
form of disc-like or circular pellets. When the vapor deposition material has a circular<br>
shape, the diameter of the vapor deposition material is appropriately in a range of 5 to 30<br>
mm, and preferably, in a range of 5 to 15 mm. This is because, if the diameter is<br>
excessively small and smaller than 5 mm, splash occurs, and if the diameter exceeds 30<br>
mm, it is difficult to handle the vapor deposition material in an actual production process.<br>
When the vapor deposition material is disc-like, the diameter of the vapor deposition<br>
material is appropriately in a range of 5 to 20 mm, and preferably, in a range of 5 to 10<br>
mm. The height of the vapor deposition material is in a range of 1 to 10 mm, and<br>
preferably, in a range of 2 to 5 mm. This is because, if the diameter is excessively small<br>
and smaller than 5 mm or the height is excessively small and smaller than 1 mm, splash<br>
occurs, and if the diameter exceeds 30 mm or the height exceeds 10 mm, it is difficult to<br>
handle the vapor deposition material in an actual production process.<br>
[0177]<br>
Hereinafter, a process for producing a ZnO vapor deposition material according<br>
to this aspect will be described.<br>
[Production Process]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material according to this aspect can be produced by<br>
mixing ZnO powder having a purity equal to or greater than 98%, CeO2 powder in such<br>
an amount that the Ce content in the ZnO vapor deposition material is in a range of 0.1 to<br>
14.9% by mass, Ga2O3 powder in such an amount that the Ga content in the ZnO vapor<br>
deposition material is in a range of 0.1 to 10% by mass, a binder, and an organic solvent<br>
to prepare a slurry with a concentration of 30 to 75% by mass, spray-drying the slurry to<br>
obtain a granulation powder having an average grain size of 50 to 300 µm, molding the<br>
granulation powder to obtain a porous molded body, and sintering the molded body at a<br>
predetermined temperature to obtain a porous ZnO sintered body.<br>
[0178]<br>
The ZnO powder preferably has purity equal to or greater than 98%, more<br>
preferably, equal to or greater than 98.4%, and still more preferably, equal to or greater<br>
than 99%. If the ZnO powder has purity equal to or greater than 98%, reduction of<br>
conductivity by the effect of impurities can be suppressed. The average grain size of<br>
the ZnO powder is in a range of 0.1 to 10 µm. When the average grain size of the ZnO<br>
powder is smaller than 0.1 urn, the powder is excessively fine and aggregated, so there is<br>
a tendency that the handling of the powder becomes worse, and it is difficult to prepare a<br>
high-concentration slurry. When the average grain size exceeds 10 µm, there is a<br>
tendency that it is difficult to control the micro-structure, and a dense pellet is hard to<br>
obtain. If the average grain size of the ZnO powder is adjusted to the above-described<br>
range, a desired sintered body is also obtained without using a sintering auxiliary agent.<br>
[0179]<br>
With regard to the CeO2 powder, considering the prevention of maldistribution of<br>
the Ce powder, reactivity with the ZnO matrix, and the purity of the Ce compound, it is<br>
preferable to add cerium oxide grains whose primary grain size is of a nanometer scale.<br>
The Ga2O3 powder preferably has an average grain size of 0.01 to 1 µm, and still more<br>
preferably, the average grain size is in a range of 0.05 to 0.5 µm. If the Ga2O3 powder<br>
having this average grain size is used, it is beneficial in terms of the uniform dispersion<br>
of the CeO2 powder.<br>
[0180]<br>
For a binder, polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl butyral, or the like may be used. It<br>
is preferable to add the binder at 0.2 to 2.5% by mass. For an organic solvent, ethanol,<br>
propanol, or the like may be used.<br>
[0181]<br>
The raw powder, the binder, and the organic solvent are mixed to prepare a slurry<br>
with a concentration of 30 to 75% by mass, and preferably, 40 to 65% by mass. If the<br>
slurry concentration exceeds 75% by mass, since the slurry is a non-aqueous system,<br>
stable granulation is difficult. If the slurry concentration is less than 30% by mass, it is<br>
difficult to obtain a dense ZnO sintered body having a uniform composition. If the<br>
slurry concentration is adjusted within the above-described range, the viscosity of the<br>
slurry is in a range of 200 to 1000 cps. Therefore, powder granulation using a spray<br>
drier can be performed stably. Further, the density of a molded body increases, such<br>
that a dense sintered body can be obtained.<br>
[0182]<br>
Wet blending of raw powder, a binder, and an organic solvent, and in particular,<br>
wet blending of raw powder and an organic solvent as a dispersion medium is preferably<br>
performed by a wet ball mill or a stirring mill. In the case of using a ZrO2 ball in the<br>
wet ball mill, wet blending is preferably performed using a large number of ZrO2 balls<br>
having a diameter of 5 to 10 mm for 8 to 24 hours, and preferably, for 20 to 24 hours. If<br>
the diameter of the ZrO2 ball is smaller than 5 mm, blending may be insufficient. If the<br>
diameter of the ZrO2 ball exceeds 10 mm, impurities are increased. Even though the<br>
blending time is long, up to 24 hours, impurities are hardly generated due to milling.<br>
On the other hand, when a resin ball with a metal support is used in the wet ball mill, a<br>
ball having a diameter of 10 to 15 mm is preferably used.<br>
[0183]<br>
In the stirring mill, wet blending is preferably performed using a ZrO2 ball having<br>
a diameter of 1 to 3 mm for 0.5 to 1 hour. If the diameter of the ZrO2 ball is smaller<br>
than 1 mm, blending is insufficient. If the diameter exceeds 3 mm, impurities are<br>
increased. If the blending time exceeds 1 hour, while raw materials are mixed, milling<br>
leads to the generation of impurities. Sufficient blending can be done within 1 hour.<br>
Blending/granulation of powder and additives may be performed by a general tumbling<br>
granulation method. In this case, it is not necessary to perform a separation operation<br>
from the balls or the like after the process, and thus the process is simplified.<br>
[0184]<br>
In the production process of this aspect, as a first step for obtaining a porous<br>
sintered body, gas is blown and mixed into the slurry to prepare a gas-containing slurry.<br>
Gas blowing and mixing is preferably performed by blowing using a mechanical pump,<br>
gas pressure, or the like. As the gas, air, an insoluble gas, a non-aqueous gas, or the like<br>
may be used.<br>
[0185]<br>
The gas-containing slurry is spray-dried. The spray drying is preferably<br>
performed at 150 to 250°C for 3 hours by using a spray drier. Since gas is blown into<br>
the slurry, the granulation powder obtained by spray-drying the slurry is porous.<br>
Through the spray drying, a porous granulation powder having an average grain size of<br>
50 to 300 urn can be obtained.<br>
[0186]<br>
In the production process of this aspect, as a second step for obtaining a porous<br>
sintered body, a slurry is prepared in which a foaming agent is mixed. For the foaming<br>
agent, an organic foaming agent or an inorganic foaming agent may be used. For the<br>
organic foaming agent, azodicarboxylamide, dinitrosobenta methylene tetramine, or the<br>
like is used, and for the inorganic foaming agent, carbonate or the like is used. The<br>
foaming agent may be mixed with ZnO powder, CeO2 powder, and Ga2O3 powder, or<br>
may be added upon slurry preparation.<br>
[0187]<br>
The foaming agent-containing slurry is spray-dried. The spray drying is<br>
preferably performed at 150 to 250°C for 3 hours by using a spray drier. The foaming<br>
agent contained in the slurry is foamed and dissolved upon this spray drying, such that<br>
resultant granulation powder is made porous. Through the spray drying, a porous<br>
granulation powder having an average grain size of 50 to 300 urn can be obtained.<br>
[0188]<br>
In the production process of this aspect, as a third step for obtaining a porous<br>
sintered body, a slurry is prepared in which an additive, which will be volatized and<br>
dissolved upon sintering, is mixed. Examples of the additive include butyral capable of<br>
being dissolved in a solvent, and a cellulose-based additive, a polyvinyl-based additive, a<br>
polyester-based additive, a polyethylene-based additive, and the like capable of being<br>
dissolved in an alcohol-based solvent. Examples of the additive which will not be<br>
dissolved in the alcohol-based solvent include a starch-based additive and a<br>
polystyrene-based additive having an average grain size of about several µm to 500 µm.<br>
It is preferable that butyral is mixed in the slurry at about 20% by mass, or starch is<br>
mixed in the slurry at about 20% by mass.<br>
[0189]<br>
If the slurry contains the additive, the additive is volatized and dissolved upon<br>
sintering to form pores, thereby obtaining a porous sintered body. The diameter and<br>
shape of the pores can be controlled by adjusting the kind and amount of the additive.<br>
For example, when a butyral-based additive is used, pores having a pore diameter of 0.1 µm to 10 µm order can be formed. When starch is used, pores having the same pore<br>
diameter as the grain size of starch and the same shape as starch can be formed. Thus,<br>
when starch is used, the pore diameter and shape of the pores can be more easily<br>
controlled.<br>
[0190]<br>
Specifically, in the case of the ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect, a<br>
vapor deposition material using a butyral-based additive can obtain a deposition speed<br>
about 1.3 times higher than the evaporation speed of the conventional ZnO vapor<br>
deposition material having relative density equal to or greater than about 98%, and a<br>
vapor deposition material using starch having an average grain size of 0.1 to 500 urn can<br>
obtain an evaporation speed about two times higher than the evaporation speed of the<br>
conventional ZnO vapor deposition material having relative density equal to or greater<br>
than about 98%. Therefore, a high speed of film formation can be obtained.<br>
[0191]<br>
In the production process of this aspect, as a fourth step for obtaining a porous<br>
sintered body, a slurry using ZnO powder having a grain size distribution within a<br>
predetermined range is prepared. Specifically, ZnO powder having an average grain<br>
size of 10 to 500 urn and a grain size distribution within a range of ±10% of the average<br>
grain size is used. If the grain size distribution of ZnO powder is outside the range of<br>
±10% of the average grain size, the porosity is lowered. More preferably, the grain size<br>
distribution is within a range of ±5% of the average grain size. The preferred grain size<br>
of CeO2 powder and Ga2O3 powder is significantly smaller than that of ZnO powder, and<br>
the usage is smaller than that of ZnO powder, so CeO2 powder and Ga2O3 powder may<br>
be outside the limitation of the grain size distribution.<br>
[0192]<br>
The slurry using ZnO powder with a controlled grain size distribution is<br>
spray-dried. The spray drying is preferably performed at 150 to 250°C for 3 hours by<br>
using a spray drier. In the slurry to be spray-dried, ZnO powder having an average<br>
grain size of 10 to 500 µm and a grain size distribution within a range of ±10% of the<br>
average grain size is used, and no fine ZnO powder is substantially contained. Thus,<br>
there are no cases where fine ZnO grains fill the gaps between ZnO grains, so the gaps<br>
between ZnO grains remain as pores, and granulation powder becomes porous.<br>
Through the spray drying, a porous granulation powder having an average grain size of<br>
50 to 300 µm can be obtained.<br>
[0193]<br>
After the slurry is spray-dried to obtain a granulation powder having an average<br>
grain size of 50 to 300 urn, the granulation powder is molded under a predetermined<br>
pressure. If the average grain size of the granulation powder is smaller than 50 µm,<br>
moldability deteriorates, and if the average grain size is larger than 300 µm, the density<br>
of the molded body is lowered, and the strength is likely to be insufficient.<br>
[0194]<br>
For a pressing molding device, a uniaxial press device, a cold isostatic press<br>
(CIP) molding device, or other devices may be used. The molding pressure is<br>
appropriately in a range of 100 to 2000 kgf/cm2 (9.8 to 196 MPa), and preferably, 100 to<br>
1000 kgf/cm2 (9.8 to 98 MPa). Molding is performed under pressure within the<br>
above-described range, such that the density of the molded body can be increased,<br>
deformation after sintering can be suppressed, and postprocessing is not required.<br>
[0195]<br>
Next, the molded body is sintered. Before sintering, the molded body is<br>
preferably degreased at a temperature of 350 to 620°C. Through this degreasing, spots<br>
on the molded body after sintering can be suppressed. The degreasing is preferably<br>
performed for a sufficient time.<br>
[0196]<br>
Sintering is performed in an atmosphere of air, an inactive gas, a vacuum, or a<br>
reductive gas at a temperature equal to or higher than 1000°C, and preferably, at a<br>
temperature of 1200 to 1400°C for 1 to 10 hours, and preferably, for 2 to 5 hours. The<br>
sintering is performed under air pressure, but in the case of pressure sintering, such as hot<br>
press (HP) sintering or hot isostatic press (HIP) sintering, the sintering is preferably<br>
performed in an atmosphere of inactive gas, vacuum, or reductive gas at a temperature<br>
equal to or higher than 1000°C for 1 to 5 hours.<br>
[0197]<br>
A ZnO film is formed on the surface of the substrate by a vacuum film formation<br>
method with a ZnO vapor deposition material composed of the resultant porous sintered<br>
body as a target material. As the vacuum film formation method suitable for forming a<br>
film using the ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect, an electron beam deposition<br>
method, an ion plating method, a sputtering method, or a plasma deposition method may<br>
be used. A ZnO film of this aspect formed by the film formation method uses the ZnO<br>
vapor deposition material of this aspect, so the ZnO film has high conductivity with<br>
specific resistance of 3 to 5X10-4 O cm and high permeability with visible light<br>
permeability equal to or greater than 90%, like ITO. Crystals distorted by Ce having an<br>
ion radius larger than Zn are recovered and aligned by adding Ga having a small ion<br>
radius, such that the durability of the film is improved.<br>
[0198]<br>
According to the production process of this aspect, in any of the first step of<br>
mixing gas in the slurry, the second step of preparing the foaming agent-containing slurry,<br>
the third step of preparing the slurry containing the additive which will be volatized and<br>
dissolved upon sintering, and the fourth step of preparing the slurry using ZnO powder<br>
having a grain size distribution within a predetermined range, the porosity, pore diameter,<br>
and pore shape can be easily controlled. Therefore, a vapor deposition material having<br>
optimum pores can be produced. As a result, even when a large number of pore states<br>
are required by the production conditions or the like, an optimum vapor deposition<br>
material can be provided to cope with the requirements.<br>
[0199]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect is composed mainly of a porous<br>
sintered body having a porosity of 5 to 30% and a pore diameter of 0.1 to 500 µm, so<br>
when a ZnO transparent conductive film is formed by an electron beam deposition<br>
method or an ion plating method using the ZnO vapor deposition material, the<br>
evaporation speed can be improved. That is, when film formation is performed with the<br>
same electron beam energy, the speed of film formation increases, and the operation time<br>
is shortened, thereby increasing the number of products for a predetermined time.<br>
Further, when film formation is performed at the same film formation speed, electron<br>
beam energy is reduced, and the replacement timing of a filament of an electron gun or<br>
the like is delayed, such that the number of times of maintenance is reduced and<br>
productivity is improved. As a result, manufacturing costs can be reduced.<br>
Next, another aspect of the present invention will be described.<br>
[ZnO vapor deposition material]<br>
A ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect is a ZnO vapor deposition<br>
material for formation of a transparent conductive film which is composed mainly of a<br>
porous ZnO sintered body containing Ce and Sc, wherein the Ce content is higher than<br>
the Sc content, the Ce content is in a range of 0.1 to 14.9% by mass, the Sc content is in a<br>
range of 0.1 to 10% by mass, and the sintered body has a porosity of 3 to 50%.<br>
[0200]<br>
The inventors have investigated in detail the effect on conductivity due to<br>
additive species and its content in a ZnO vapor deposition material and a ZnO film<br>
formed by using the vapor deposition material, and have found that there is a significant<br>
level of influence due to the content ratio of the two elements of Ce and Sc as the<br>
additive elements in the porous ZnO sintered body. Based on the above-described<br>
knowledge, the ZnO vapor deposition material according to this aspect contains ZnO as a<br>
major component, and also contains both elements of Ce and Sc, such that excess<br>
electrons contributing to conduction are developed in large amounts and maintained,<br>
thereby forming a ZnO film having high conductivity.<br>
[0201]<br>
As the ratio of the two elements of Ce and Sc in the porous ZnO sintered body<br>
increases within a predetermined range, the conductivity of the ZnO film becomes better,<br>
and if the ratio is outside the range, the conductivity adversely deteriorates. Specifically,<br>
the Ce content in the ZnO vapor deposition material is appropriately in a range of 0.1 to<br>
14.9% by mass, and preferably, in a range of 3 to 6% by mass. If the Ce content is<br>
lower than the lower limit value, 0.1% by mass, the conductivity is significantly lowered.<br>
If the Ce content exceeds the upper limit value, 14.9% by mass, the permeability is<br>
significantly lowered.<br>
[0202]<br>
The Sc content in the ZnO vapor deposition material is appropriately in a range of<br>
0.1 to 10% by mass, and preferably, in a range of 1 to 3% by mass. If the Sc content is<br>
lower than the lower limit value, 0.1% by mass, the conductivity is significantly lowered.<br>
If the Sc content exceeds the upper limit value, 10% by mass, compositional shift at the<br>
time of deposition occurs.<br>
[0203]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect contains a larger amount of Ce<br>
than Sc, such that a dense crystal structure is maintained. If the Ce content is lower than<br>
the Sc content, the conductivity and permeability are lowered. The total content of Ce<br>
and Sc is preferably in a range of 0.2 to 15% by mass. If the total content of Ce and Sc<br>
exceeds this range, the specific resistance and permeability of the ZnO vapor deposition<br>
material are significantly lowered.<br>
[0204]<br>
When a very small amount of Ce and Sc is contained in the ZnO vapor deposition<br>
material, Ce and Sc do not exist as granular precipitates in grain boundaries or grains in<br>
the ZnO matrix but are uniformly dispersed in the ZnO vapor deposition material. It is<br>
considered that, in the ZnO vapor deposition material, Ce is present as an oxide, such as<br>
CeO2 or Ce2O3, and Sc is present as Sc2O3.<br>
[0205]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect contains Ce, which is a trivalent<br>
or quadrivalent rare earth element, as an additive element, and Ce causes excess carrier<br>
electrons to be generated with respect to divalent Zn, such that high conductivity can be<br>
ensured. When a rare earth element is added to the ZnO vapor deposition material,<br>
compositional shift at the time of deposition is unlikely to occur, and a desired<br>
composition ratio can be maintained when a film is formed.<br>
[0206]<br>
According to the ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect, the conductivity is<br>
obtained by oxygen defect as well as compulsive injection of carrier electrons. Usually,<br>
oxygen gas is introduced in a vapor deposition method, but generally oxygen in the film<br>
composition is insufficient. At the time of transparent conductive film formation, a<br>
technique is conventionally used in which resistance is lowered by generating oxygen<br>
defect. However, in the case of adding a rare earth element, it is easy to control because<br>
the element is excellent in evaporation performance. In addition to this advantage, since<br>
the ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect contains Sc as an additive element, high<br>
conductivity like ITO can be obtained.<br>
[0207]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect is composed of a porous ZnO<br>
sintered body having a porosity of 3 to 50%. The porosity of the sintered body is<br>
appropriately in a range of 3 to 50%, preferably in a range of 5 to 30%, more preferably<br>
in a range of 10 to 30%, and still more preferably in a range of 20 to 30%. If the<br>
porosity is smaller than 3%, it is not preferable since, at the time of film formation by an<br>
electron beam deposition method or an ion plating method, the evaporation speed of the<br>
vapor deposition material does not increase, and as a result, the speed of film formation<br>
decreases, which results in an increase in manufacturing costs. If the porosity exceeds<br>
50%, the strength of the porous sintered body is lowered, and it is difficult to obtain<br>
sufficient mechanical strength. If the porosity is equal to or greater than 10%, the<br>
evaporation speed can be improved. Further, if the porosity is equal to or greater than<br>
20%, a vapor deposition material having an evaporation speed about two times higher<br>
than the conventional ZnO vapor deposition material can be obtained.<br>
[0208]<br>
In the porous ZnO sintered body of this aspect, the pores preferably have an<br>
average pore diameter of 0.1 to 500 µm. If the average pore diameter of the pores is<br>
within the above-described range, the evaporation speed can be further increased. If the<br>
pore diameter is smaller than 0.1 urn, there is no merit in the pores. If the pore diameter<br>
exceeds 500 µm, it is not preferable because the strength of the sintered body is lowered,<br>
which causes damages due to EB (electron beam) irradiation, that is, splash.<br>
[0209]<br>
The term "pore diameter" (the inner diameter of the pore) refers to, for example,<br>
the maximum value of the internal dimensions in the pores when the sectional portion of<br>
the vapor deposition material is observed by observation means, such as SEM or the like.<br>
As the evaluation method of the pores, measurement of porosity by a substitution method,<br>
measurement of porosity by microscopy, measurement of surface area and micropore<br>
distribution by gas absorption, measurement of surface area and micropore distribution<br>
by a mercury intrusion method, measurement of surface area by a gas permeation method,<br>
or measurement of micropore distribution by an X-ray small-angle scattering method<br>
may be used.<br>
[0210]<br>
The pores are preferably rounded, and in terms of improvement in the<br>
evaporation speed, micropores are preferably formed at the surface of the pores. For the<br>
evaluation method of the pores, the surface area is preferably in a range of 5 to 40 m /g,<br>
and at least one peak of the micropore distribution is present within a range of 1 to 100<br>
urn. Portions (frame portion) other than the pores are preferably substantially sintered.<br>
For example, the frame portion of the porous sintered body preferably has a density equal<br>
to or greater than 98%.<br>
[0211]<br>
In the porous ZnO sintered body of this aspect, it is preferable that grains<br>
preferably have an average crystal grain size of 1 to 500 µm, and rounded pores of about<br>
0.1 to 500 µm are provided in the sintered body. The porous ZnO sintered body has a<br>
fine crystal structure in which the average crystal grain size is within the above-described<br>
range, and the occurrence of defects in the boundary of crystal grains can be reduced.<br>
Thus, the formed ZnO film has excellent film characteristics, such as ZnO film density,<br>
thickness distribution, refractive index, sputtering resistance, discharge characteristics<br>
(discharge voltage, discharge responsiveness, and the like), insulation characteristics, and<br>
the like. If the average crystal grain size is smaller than 1 µm, the speed of film<br>
formation is lowered. If the average crystal grain size exceeds 500 µm, the deposition<br>
rate of the additive element is not uniform. The average crystal grain size is preferably<br>
in a range of 5 to 40 µm, and more preferably, in a range of 10 to 30 µm.<br>
[0212]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect is preferably molded in the<br>
form of disc-like or circular pellets. When the vapor deposition material has a circular<br>
shape, the diameter of the vapor deposition material is appropriately in a range of 5 to 30<br>
mm, and preferably, in a range of 5 to 15 mm. This is because, if the diameter is<br>
excessively small and smaller than 5 mm, splash occurs, and if the diameter exceeds 30<br>
mm, it is difficult to handle the vapor deposition material in an actual production process.<br>
When the vapor deposition material is disc-like, the diameter of the vapor deposition<br>
material is appropriately in a range of 5 to 20 mm, and preferably, in a range of 5 to 10<br>
mm. The height of the vapor deposition material is in a range of 1 to 10 mm, and<br>
preferably, in a range of 2 to 5 mm. This is because, if the diameter is excessively small<br>
and smaller than 5 mm or the height is excessively small and smaller than 1 mm, splash<br>
occurs, and if the diameter exceeds 30 mm or the height exceeds 10 mm, it is difficult to<br>
handle the vapor deposition material in an actual production process.<br>
[0213]<br>
Hereinafter, a process for producing a ZnO vapor deposition material according<br>
to this aspect will be described.<br>
[Production Process]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material according to this aspect can be produced by<br>
mixing ZnO powder having a purity equal to or greater than 98%, CeO2 powder in such<br>
an amount that the Ce content in the ZnO vapor deposition material is in a range of 0.1 to<br>
14.9% by mass, Sc2O3 powder in such an amount that the Sc content in the ZnO vapor<br>
deposition material is in a range of 0.1 to 10% by mass, a binder, and an organic solvent<br>
to prepare a slurry with a concentration of 30 to 75% by mass, spray-drying the slurry to<br>
obtain a granulation powder having an average grain size of 50 to 300 µm, molding the<br>
granulation powder to obtain a porous molded body, and sintering the molded body at a<br>
predetermined temperature to obtain a porous ZnO sintered body.<br>
[0214]<br>
The ZnO powder preferably has purity equal to or greater than 98%, more<br>
preferably, equal to or greater than 98.4%, and still more preferably, equal to or greater<br>
than 99%. If the ZnO powder has purity equal to or greater than 98%, reduction of<br>
conductivity by the effect of impurities can be suppressed. The average grain size of<br>
the ZnO powder is in a range of 0.1 to 10 µm. When the average grain size of the ZnO<br>
powder is smaller than 0.1 µm, the powder is excessively fine and aggregated, so there is<br>
a tendency that the handling of the powder becomes worse, and it is difficult to prepare a<br>
high-concentration slurry. When the average grain size exceeds 10 µm, there is a<br>
tendency that it is difficult to control the micro-structure, and a dense pellet is hard to<br>
obtain. If the average grain size of the ZnO powder is adjusted to the above-described<br>
range, a desired sintered body is also obtained without using a sintering auxiliary agent.<br>
[0215]<br>
With regard to the CeO2 powder, considering the prevention of maldistribution of<br>
the Ce powder, reactivity with the ZnO matrix, and the purity of the Ce compound, it is<br>
preferable to add cerium oxide grains whose primary grain size is of a nanometer scale.<br>
The Sc2O3 powder preferably has an average grain size of 0.01 to 1 µm, and still more<br>
preferably, the average grain size is in a range of 0.05 to 0.5 urn. If the Sc2O3 powder<br>
having this average grain size is used, it is beneficial in terms of the uniform dispersion<br>
of the CeO2 powder.<br>
[0216]<br>
For a binder, polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl butyral, or the like may be used. It<br>
is preferable to add the binder at 0.2 to 2.5% by mass. For an organic solvent, ethanol,<br>
propanol, or the like may be used.<br>
[0217]<br>
The raw powder, the binder, and the organic solvent are mixed to prepare a slurry<br>
with a concentration of 30 to 75% by mass, and preferably, 40 to 65% by mass. If the<br>
slurry concentration exceeds 75% by mass, since the slurry is a non-aqueous system,<br>
stable granulation is difficult. If the slurry concentration is less than 30% by mass, it is<br>
difficult to obtain a dense ZnO sintered body having a uniform composition. If the<br>
slurry concentration is adjusted within the above-described range, the viscosity of the<br>
slurry is in a range of 200 to 1000 cps. Therefore, powder granulation using a spray<br>
drier can be performed stably. Further, the density of a molded body increases, such<br>
that a dense sintered body can be obtained.<br>
[0218]<br>
Wet blending of raw powder, a binder, and an organic solvent, and in particular,<br>
wet blending of raw powder and an organic solvent as a dispersion medium is preferably<br>
performed by a wet ball mill or a stirring mill. In the case of using a ZrO2 ball in the<br>
wet ball mill, wet blending is preferably performed using a large number of ZrO2 balls<br>
having a diameter of 5 to 10 mm for 8 to 24 hours, and preferably, for 20 to 24 hours. If<br>
the diameter of the ZrO2 ball is smaller than 5 mm, blending may be insufficient. If the<br>
diameter of the ZrO2 ball exceeds 10 mm, impurities are increased. Even though the<br>
blending time is long, up to 24 hours, impurities are hardly generated due to milling.<br>
On the other hand, when a resin ball with a metal support is used in the wet ball mill, a<br>
ball having a diameter of 10 to 15 mm is preferably used.<br>
[0219]<br>
In the stirring mill, wet blending is preferably performed using a ZrO2 ball having<br>
a diameter of 1 to 3 mm for 0.5 to 1 hour. If the diameter of the ZrO2 ball is smaller<br>
than 1 mm, blending is insufficient. If the diameter exceeds 3 mm, impurities are<br>
increased. If the blending time exceeds 1 hour, while raw materials are mixed, milling<br>
leads to the generation of impurities. Sufficient blending can be done within 1 hour.<br>
Blending/granulation of powder and additives may be performed by a general tumbling<br>
granulation method. In this case, it is not necessary to perform a separation operation<br>
from the balls or the like after the process, and thus the process is simplified.<br>
[0220]<br>
In the production process of this aspect, as a first step for obtaining a porous<br>
sintered body, gas is blown and mixed into the slurry to prepare a gas-containing slurry.<br>
Gas blowing and mixing is preferably performed by blowing using a mechanical pump,<br>
gas pressure, or the like. As the gas, air, an insoluble gas, a non-aqueous gas, or the like<br>
may be used.<br>
[0221]<br>
The gas-containing slurry is spray-dried. The spray drying is preferably<br>
performed at 150 to 250°C for 3 hours by using a spray drier. Since gas is blown into<br>
the slurry, the granulation powder obtained by spray-drying the slurry is porous.<br>
Through the spray drying, a porous granulation powder having an average grain size of<br>
50 to 300 µm can be obtained.<br>
[0222]<br>
In the production process of this aspect, as a second step for obtaining a porous<br>
sintered body, a slurry is prepared in which a foaming agent is mixed. For the foaming<br>
agent, an organic foaming agent or an inorganic foaming agent may be used. For the<br>
organic foaming agent, azodicarboxylamide, dinitrosobenta methylene tetramine, or the<br>
like is used, and for the inorganic foaming agent, carbonate or the like is used. The<br>
foaming agent may be mixed with ZnO powder, CeO2 powder, and Sc203 powder, or<br>
may be added upon slurry preparation.<br>
[0223]<br>
The foaming agent-containing slurry is spray-dried. The spray drying is<br>
preferably performed at 150 to 250°C for 3 hours by using a spray drier. The foaming<br>
agent contained in the slurry is foamed and dissolved upon this spray drying, such that<br>
resultant granulation powder is made porous. Through the spray drying, a porous<br>
granulation powder having an average grain size of 50 to 300 µm can be obtained.<br>
[0224]<br>
In the production process of this aspect, as a third step for obtaining a porous<br>
sintered body, a slurry is prepared in which an additive, which will be volatized and<br>
dissolved upon sintering, is mixed. Examples of the additive include butyral capable of<br>
being dissolved in a solvent, and a cellulose-based additive, a polyvinyl-based additive, a<br>
polyester-based additive, a polyethylene-based additive, and the like capable of being<br>
dissolved in an alcohol-based solvent. Examples of the additive which will not be<br>
dissolved in the alcohol-based solvent include a starch-based additive and a<br>
polystyrene-based additive having an average grain size of about several µm to 500 µm.<br>
It is preferable that butyral is mixed in the slurry at about 20% by mass, or starch is<br>
mixed in the slurry at about 20% by mass.<br>
[0225]<br>
If the slurry contains the additive, the additive is volatized and dissolved upon<br>
sintering to form pores, thereby obtaining a porous sintered body. The diameter and<br>
shape of the pores can be controlled by adjusting the kind and amount of the additive.<br>
For example, when a butyral-based additive is used, pores having a pore diameter of 0.1 µm to 10 µm order can be formed. When starch is used, pores having the same pore<br>
diameter as the grain size of starch and the same shape as starch can be formed. Thus,<br>
when starch is used, the pore diameter and shape of the pores can be more easily<br>
controlled.<br>
[0226]<br>
Specifically, in the case of the ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect, a<br>
vapor deposition material using a butyral-based additive can obtain a deposition speed<br>
about 1.3 times higher than the evaporation speed of the conventional ZnO vapor<br>
deposition material having relative density equal to or greater than about 98%, and a<br>
vapor deposition material using starch having an average grain size of 0.1 to 500 µm can<br>
obtain an evaporation speed about two times higher than the evaporation speed of the<br>
conventional ZnO vapor deposition material having relative density equal to or greater<br>
than about 98%. Therefore, a high speed of film formation can be obtained.<br>
[0227]<br>
In the production process of this aspect, as a fourth step for obtaining a porous<br>
sintered body, a slurry using ZnO powder having a grain size distribution within a<br>
predetermined range is prepared. Specifically, ZnO powder having an average grain<br>
size of 10 to 500 µm and a grain size distribution within a range of ±10% of the average<br>
grain size is used. If the grain size distribution of ZnO powder is outside the range of<br>
±10% of the average grain size, the porosity is lowered. More preferably, the grain size<br>
distribution is within a range of ±5% of the average grain size. The preferred grain size<br>
of CeO2 powder and SC2O3 powder is significantly smaller than that of ZnO powder, and<br>
the usage is smaller than that of ZnO powder, so CeO2 powder and SC2O3 powder may be<br>
outside the limitation of the grain size distribution.<br>
[0228]<br>
The slurry using ZnO powder with a controlled grain size distribution is<br>
spray-dried. The spray drying is preferably performed at 150 to 250°C for 3 hours by<br>
using a spray drier. In the slurry to be spray-dried, ZnO powder having an average<br>
grain size of 10 to 500 µm and a grain size distribution within a range of ±10% of the<br>
average grain size is used, and no fine ZnO powder is substantially contained. Thus,<br>
there are no cases where fine ZnO grains fill the gaps between ZnO grains, so the gaps<br>
between ZnO grains remain as pores, and granulation powder becomes porous.<br>
Through the spray drying, a porous granulation powder having an average grain size of<br>
50 to 300 µm can be obtained.<br>
[0229]<br>
After the slurry is spray-dried to obtain a granulation powder having an average<br>
grain size of 50 to 300 µm, the granulation powder is molded under a predetermined<br>
pressure. If the average grain size of the granulation powder is smaller than 50 µm,<br>
moldability deteriorates, and if the average grain size is larger than 300 urn, the density<br>
of the molded body is lowered, and the strength is likely to be insufficient.<br>
[0230]<br>
For a pressing molding device, a uniaxial press device, a cold isostatic press<br>
(CIP) molding device, or other devices may be used. The molding pressure is<br>
appropriately in a range of 100 to 2000 kgf/cm2 (9.8 to 196 MPa), and preferably, 100 to<br>
1000 kgf/cm2 (9.8 to 98 MPa). Molding is performed under pressure within the<br>
above-described range, such that the density of the molded body can be increased,<br>
deformation after sintering can be suppressed, and postprocessing is not required.<br>
[0231]<br>
Next, the molded body is sintered. Before sintering, the molded body is<br>
preferably degreased at a temperature of 350 to 620°C. Through this degreasing, spots<br>
on the molded body after sintering can be suppressed. The degreasing is preferably<br>
performed for a sufficient time.<br>
[0232]<br>
Sintering is performed in an atmosphere of air, an inactive gas, a vacuum, or a<br>
reductive gas at a temperature equal to or higher than 1000°C, and preferably, at a<br>
temperature of 1200 to 1400°C for 1 to 10 hours, and preferably, for 2 to 5 hours. The<br>
sintering is performed under air pressure, but in the case of pressure sintering, such as hot<br>
press (HP) sintering or hot isostatic press (HIP) sintering, the sintering is preferably<br>
performed in an atmosphere of inactive gas, vacuum, or reductive gas at a temperature<br>
equal to or higher than 1000°C for 1 to 5 hours.<br>
[0233]<br>
A ZnO film is formed on the surface of the substrate by a vacuum film formation<br>
method with a ZnO vapor deposition material composed of the resultant porous sintered<br>
body as a target material. As the vacuum film formation method suitable for forming a<br>
film using the ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect, an electron beam deposition<br>
method, an ion plating method, a sputtering method, or a plasma deposition method may<br>
be used. A ZnO film of this aspect formed by the film formation method uses the ZnO<br>
vapor deposition material of this aspect, so the ZnO film has high conductivity with<br>
specific resistance of 3 to 5X10-4 O-cm and high permeability with visible light<br>
permeability equal to or greater than 90%, like ITO. Crystals distorted by Ce having an<br>
ion radius larger than Zn are recovered and aligned by adding Sc having a small ion<br>
radius, such that the durability of the film is improved.<br>
[0234]<br>
According to the production process of this aspect, in any of the first step of<br>
mixing gas in the slurry, the second step of preparing the foaming agent-containing slurry,<br>
the third step of preparing the slurry containing the additive which will be volatized and<br>
dissolved upon sintering, and the fourth step of preparing the slurry using ZnO powder<br>
having a grain size distribution within a predetermined range, the porosity, pore diameter,<br>
and pore shape can be easily controlled. Therefore, a vapor deposition material having<br>
optimum pores can be produced. As a result, even when a large number of pore states<br>
are required by the production conditions or the like, an optimum vapor deposition<br>
material can be provided to cope with the requirements.<br>
[0235]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect is composed mainly of a porous<br>
sintered body having a porosity of 5 to 30% and a pore diameter of 0.1 to 500 µm, so<br>
when a ZnO transparent conductive film is formed by an electron beam deposition<br>
method or an ion plating method using the ZnO vapor deposition material, the<br>
evaporation speed can be improved. That is, when film formation is performed with the<br>
same electron beam energy, the speed of film formation increases, and the operation time<br>
is shortened, thereby increasing the number of products for a predetermined time.<br>
Further, when film formation is performed at the same film formation speed, electron<br>
beam energy is reduced, and the replacement timing of a filament of an electron gun or<br>
the like is delayed, such that the number of times of maintenance is reduced and<br>
productivity is improved. As a result, production costs can be reduced.<br>
[0236]<br>
Next, another aspect of the present invention will be described.<br>
[ZnO vapor deposition material]<br>
A ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect is a ZnO vapor deposition<br>
material for formation of a transparent conductive film which is composed mainly of a<br>
porous ZnO sintered body containing Ce and B, wherein the Ce content is higher than the<br>
B content, the Ce content is in a range of 0.1 to 14.9% by mass, the B content is in a<br>
range of 0.1 to 10% by mass, and the sintered body has a porosity of 3 to 50%.<br>
[0237]<br>
The inventors have investigated in detail the effect on conductivity due to<br>
additive species and its content in a ZnO vapor deposition material and a ZnO film<br>
formed by using the vapor deposition material, and have found that there is a significant<br>
level of influence due to the content ratio of the two elements of Ce and B as the additive<br>
elements in the porous ZnO sintered body. Based on the above-described knowledge,<br>
the ZnO vapor deposition material according to this aspect contains ZnO as a major<br>
component, and also contains both elements of Ce and B, such that excess electrons<br>
contributing to conduction are developed in large amounts and maintained, thereby<br>
forming a ZnO film having high conductivity.<br>
[0238]<br>
As the ratio of the two elements of Ce and B in the porous ZnO sintered body<br>
increases within a predetermined range, the conductivity of the ZnO film becomes better,<br>
and if the ratio is outside the range, the conductivity adversely deteriorates. Specifically,<br>
the Ce content in the ZnO vapor deposition material is appropriately in a range of 0.1 to<br>
14.9% by mass, and preferably, in a range of 3 to 6% by mass. If the Ce content is<br>
lower than the lower limit value, 0.1% by mass, the conductivity is significantly lowered.<br>
If the Ce content exceeds the upper limit value, 14.9% by mass, the permeability is<br>
significantly lowered.<br>
[0239]<br>
The B content in the ZnO vapor deposition material is appropriately in a range of<br>
0.1 to 10% by mass, and preferably, in a range of 1 to 3% by mass. If the B content is<br>
lower than the lower limit value, 0.1% by mass, the conductivity is significantly lowered.<br>
If the B content exceeds the upper limit value, 10% by mass, compositional shift at the<br>
time of deposition occurs.<br>
[0240]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect contains a larger amount of Ce<br>
than B, such that a dense crystal structure is maintained. If the Ce content is lower than<br>
the B content, the conductivity and permeability are lowered. The total content of Ce<br>
and B is preferably in a range of 0.2 to 15% by mass. If the total content of Ce and B<br>
exceeds this range, the specific resistance and permeability of the ZnO vapor deposition<br>
material are significantly lowered.<br>
[0241]<br>
When a very small amount of Ce and B is contained in the ZnO vapor deposition<br>
material, Ce and B do not exist as granular precipitates in grain boundaries or grains in<br>
the ZnO matrix but are uniformly dispersed in the ZnO vapor deposition material. It is<br>
considered that, in the ZnO vapor deposition material, Ce is present as an oxide, such as<br>
CeO2 or Ce2O3, and B is present as B2O3.<br>
[0242]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect contains Ce, which is a trivalent<br>
or quadrivalent rare earth element, as an additive element, and Ce causes excess carrier<br>
electrons to be generated with respect to divalent Zn, such that high conductivity can be<br>
ensured. When a rare earth element is added to the ZnO vapor deposition material,<br>
compositional shift at the time of deposition is unlikely to occur, and a desired<br>
composition ratio can be maintained when a film is formed.<br>
[0243]<br>
According to the ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect, the conductivity is<br>
obtained by oxygen defect as well as compulsive injection of carrier electrons. Usually,<br>
oxygen gas is introduced in a vapor deposition method, but generally oxygen in the film<br>
composition is insufficient. At the time of transparent conductive film formation, a<br>
technique is conventionally used in which resistance is lowered by generating oxygen<br>
defect. However, in the case of adding a rare earth element, it is easy to control because<br>
the element is excellent in evaporation performance. In addition to this advantage, since<br>
the ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect contains B as an additive element, high<br>
conductivity like ITO can be obtained.<br>
[0244]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect is composed of a porous ZnO<br>
sintered body having a porosity of 3 to 50%. The porosity of the sintered body is<br>
appropriately in a range of 3 to 50%, preferably in a range of 5 to 30%, more preferably<br>
in a range of 10 to 30%, and still more preferably in a range of 20 to 30%. If the<br>
porosity is smaller than 3%, it is not preferable since, at the time of film formation by an<br>
electron beam deposition method or an ion plating method, the evaporation speed of the<br>
vapor deposition material does not increase, and as a result, the speed of film formation<br>
decreases, which results in an increase in production costs. If the porosity exceeds 50%,<br>
the strength of the porous sintered body is lowered, and it is difficult to obtain sufficient<br>
mechanical strength. If the porosity is equal to or greater than 10%, the evaporation<br>
speed can be improved. Further, if the porosity is equal to or greater than 20%, a vapor<br>
deposition material having an evaporation speed about two times higher than the<br>
conventional ZnO vapor deposition material can be obtained.<br>
[0245]<br>
In the porous ZnO sintered body of this aspect, the pores preferably have an<br>
average pore diameter of 0.1 to 500 µm. If the average pore diameter of the pores is<br>
within the above-described range, the evaporation speed can be further increased. If the<br>
pore diameter is smaller than 0.1 µm, there is no merit in the pores. If the pore diameter<br>
exceeds 500 µm, it is not preferable because the strength of the sintered body is lowered,<br>
which causes damages due to EB (electron beam) irradiation, that is, splash.<br>
[0246]<br>
The term "pore diameter" (the inner diameter of the pore) refers to, for example,<br>
the maximum value of the internal dimensions in the pores when the sectional portion of<br>
the vapor deposition material is observed by observation means, such as SEM or the like.<br>
As the evaluation method of the pores, measurement of porosity by a substitution method,<br>
measurement of porosity by microscopy, measurement of surface area and micropore<br>
distribution by gas absorption, measurement of surface area and micropore distribution<br>
by a mercury intrusion method, measurement of surface area by a gas permeation method,<br>
or measurement of micropore distribution by an X-ray small-angle scattering method<br>
may be used.<br>
[0247]<br>
The pores are preferably rounded, and in terms of improvement in the<br>
evaporation speed, micropores are preferably formed at the surface of the pores. For the<br>
evaluation method of the pores, the surface area is preferably in a range of 5 to 40 m2/g,<br>
and at least one peak of the micropore distribution is present within a range of 1 to 100 µm. Portions (frame portion) other than the pores are preferably substantially sintered.<br>
For example, the frame portion of the porous sintered body preferably has a density equal<br>
to or greater than 98%.<br>
[0248]<br>
In the porous ZnO sintered body of this aspect, it is preferable that grains<br>
preferably have an average crystal grain size of 1 to 500 |um, and rounded pores of about<br>
0.1 to 500 µm are provided in the sintered body. The porous ZnO sintered body has a<br>
fine crystal structure in which the average crystal grain size is within the above-described<br>
range, and the occurrence of defects in the boundary of crystal grains can be reduced.<br>
Thus, the formed ZnO film has excellent film characteristics, such as ZnO film density,<br>
thickness distribution, refractive index, sputtering resistance, discharge characteristics<br>
(discharge voltage, discharge responsiveness, and the like), insulation characteristics, and<br>
the like. If the average crystal grain size is smaller than 1 urn, the speed of film<br>
formation is lowered. If the average crystal grain size exceeds 500 urn, the deposition<br>
rate of the additive element is not uniform. The average crystal grain size is preferably<br>
in a range of 5 to 40 urn, and more preferably, in a range of 10 to 30 µm.<br>
[0249]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect is preferably molded in the<br>
form of disc-like or circular pellets. When the vapor deposition material has a circular<br>
shape, the diameter of the vapor deposition material is appropriately in a range of 5 to 30<br>
mm, and preferably, in a range of 5 to 15 mm. This is because, if the diameter is<br>
excessively small and smaller than 5 mm, splash occurs, and if the diameter exceeds 30<br>
mm, it is difficult to handle the vapor deposition material in an actual production process.<br>
When the vapor deposition material is disc-like, the diameter of the vapor deposition<br>
material is appropriately in a range of 5 to 20 mm, and preferably, in a range of 5 to 10<br>
mm. The height of the vapor deposition material is in a range of 1 to 10 mm, and<br>
preferably, in a range of 2 to 5 mm. This is because, if the diameter is excessively small<br>
and smaller than 5 mm or the height is excessively small and smaller than 1 mm, splash<br>
occurs, and if the diameter exceeds 30 mm or the height exceeds 10 mm, it is difficult to<br>
handle the vapor deposition material in an actual production process.<br>
[0250]<br>
Hereinafter, a process for producing a ZnO vapor deposition material according<br>
to this aspect will be described.<br>
[Production Process]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material according to this aspect can be produced by<br>
mixing ZnO powder having a purity equal to or greater than 98%, CeO2 powder in such<br>
an amount that the Ce content in the ZnO vapor deposition material is in a range of 0.1 to<br>
14.9% by mass, B2O3 powder in such an amount that the B content in the ZnO vapor<br>
deposition material is in a range of 0.1 to 10% by mass, a binder, and an organic solvent<br>
to prepare a slurry with a concentration of 30 to 75% by mass, spray-drying the slurry to<br>
obtain a granulation powder having an average grain size of 50 to 300 µm, molding the<br>
granulation powder to obtain a porous molded body, and sintering the molded body at a<br>
predetermined temperature to obtain a porous ZnO sintered body.<br>
[0251]<br>
The ZnO powder preferably has purity equal to or greater than 98%, more<br>
preferably, equal to or greater than 98.4%, and still more preferably, equal to or greater<br>
than 99%. If the ZnO powder has purity equal to or greater than 98%, reduction of<br>
conductivity by the effect of impurities can be suppressed. The average grain size of<br>
the ZnO powder is in a range of 0.1 to 10 µm. When the average grain size of the ZnO<br>
powder is smaller than 0.1 µm, the powder is excessively fine and aggregated, so there is<br>
a tendency that the handling of the powder becomes worse, and it is difficult to prepare a<br>
high-concentration slurry. When the average grain size exceeds 10 µm, there is a<br>
tendency that it is difficult to control the micro-structure, and a dense pellet is hard to<br>
obtain. If the average grain size of the ZnO powder is adjusted to the above-described<br>
range, a desired sintered body is also obtained without using a sintering auxiliary agent.<br>
[0252]<br>
With regard to the CeO2 powder, considering the prevention of maldistribution of<br>
the Ce powder, reactivity with the ZnO matrix, and the purity of the Ce compound, it is<br>
preferable to add cerium oxide grains whose primary grain size is of a nanometer scale.<br>
The B2O3 powder preferably has an average grain size of 0.01 to 1 µm, and still more<br>
preferably, the average grain size is in a range of 0.05 to 0.5 µm. If the B2O3 powder<br>
having this average grain size is used, it is beneficial in terms of the uniform dispersion<br>
of the CeO2 powder.<br>
[0253]<br>
For a binder, polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl butyral, or the like may be used. It<br>
is preferable to add the binder at 0.2 to 2.5% by mass. For an organic solvent, ethanol,<br>
propanol, or the like may be used.<br>
[0254]<br>
The raw powder, the binder, and the organic solvent are mixed to prepare a slurry<br>
with a concentration of 30 to 75% by mass, and preferably, 40 to 65% by mass. If the<br>
slurry concentration exceeds 75% by mass, since the slurry is a non-aqueous system,<br>
stable granulation is difficult. If the slurry concentration is less than 30% by mass, it is<br>
difficult to obtain a dense ZnO sintered body having a uniform composition. If the<br>
slurry concentration is adjusted within the above-described range, the viscosity of the<br>
slurry is in a range of 200 to 1000 cps. Therefore, powder granulation using a spray<br>
drier can be performed stably. Further, the density of a molded body increases, such<br>
that a dense sintered body can be obtained.<br>
[0255]<br>
Wet blending of raw powder, a binder, and an organic solvent, and in particular,<br>
wet blending of raw powder and an organic solvent as a dispersion medium is preferably<br>
performed by a wet ball mill or a stirring mill. In the case of using a ZrO2 ball in the<br>
wet ball mill, wet blending is preferably performed using a large number of ZrO2 balls<br>
having a diameter of 5 to 10 mm for 8 to 24 hours, and preferably, for 20 to 24 hours. If<br>
the diameter of the ZrO2 ball is smaller than 5 mm, blending may be insufficient. If the<br>
diameter of the ZrO2 ball exceeds 10 mm, impurities are increased. Even though the<br>
blending time is long, up to 24 hours, impurities are hardly generated due to milling.<br>
On the other hand, when a resin ball with a metal support is used in the wet ball mill, a<br>
ball having a diameter of 10 to 15 mm is preferably used.<br>
[0256]<br>
In the stirring mill, wet blending is preferably performed using a ZrO2 ball having<br>
a diameter of 1 to 3 mm for 0.5 to 1 hour. If the diameter of the ZrO2 ball is smaller<br>
than 1 mm, blending is insufficient. If the diameter exceeds 3 mm, impurities are<br>
increased. If the blending time exceeds 1 hour, while raw materials are mixed, milling<br>
leads to the generation of impurities. Sufficient blending can be done within 1 hour.<br>
Blending/granulation of powder and additives may be performed by a general tumbling<br>
granulation method. In this case, it is not necessary to perform a separation operation<br>
from the balls or the like after the process, and thus the process is simplified.<br>
[0257]<br>
In the production process of this aspect, as a first step for obtaining a porous<br>
sintered body, gas is blown and mixed into the slurry to prepare a gas-containing slurry.<br>
Gas blowing and mixing is preferably performed by blowing using a mechanical pump,<br>
gas pressure, or the like. As the gas, air, an insoluble gas, a non-aqueous gas, or the like<br>
may be used.<br>
[0258]<br>
The gas-containing slurry is spray-dried. The spray drying is preferably<br>
performed at 150 to 250°C for 3 hours by using a spray drier. Since gas is blown into<br>
the slurry, the granulation powder obtained by spray-drying the slurry is porous.<br>
Through the spray drying, a porous granulation powder having an average grain size of<br>
50 to 300 µm can be obtained.<br>
[0259]<br>
In the production process of this aspect, as a second step for obtaining a porous<br>
sintered body, a slurry is prepared in which a foaming agent is mixed. For the foaming<br>
agent, an organic foaming agent or an inorganic foaming agent may be used. For the<br>
organic foaming agent, azodicarboxylamide, dinitrosobenta methylene tetramine, or the<br>
like is used, and for the inorganic foaming agent, carbonate or the like is used. The<br>
foaming agent may be mixed with ZnO powder, CeO2 powder, and B2O3 powder, or may<br>
be added upon slurry preparation.<br>
[0260]<br>
The foaming agent-containing slurry is spray-dried. The spray drying is<br>
preferably performed at 150 to 250°C for 3 hours by using a spray drier. The foaming<br>
agent contained in the slurry is foamed and dissolved upon this spray drying, such that<br>
resultant granulation powder is made porous. Through the spray drying, a porous<br>
granulation powder having an average grain size of 50 to 300 µm can be obtained.<br>
[0261]<br>
In the production process of this aspect, as a third step for obtaining a porous<br>
sintered body, a slurry is prepared in which an additive, which will be volatized and<br>
dissolved upon sintering, is mixed. Examples of the additive include butyral capable of<br>
being dissolved in a solvent, and a cellulose-based additive, a polyvinyl-based additive, a<br>
polyester-based additive, a polyethylene-based additive, and the like capable of being<br>
dissolved in an alcohol-based solvent. Examples of the additive which will not be<br>
dissolved in the alcohol-based solvent include a starch-based additive and a<br>
polystyrene-based additive having an average grain size of about several µm to 500 µm.<br>
It is preferable that butyral is mixed in the slurry at about 20% by mass, or starch is<br>
mixed in the slurry at about 20% by mass.<br>
[0262]<br>
If the slurry contains the additive, the additive is volatized and dissolved upon<br>
sintering to form pores, thereby obtaining a porous sintered body. The diameter and<br>
shape of the pores can be controlled by adjusting the kind and amount of the additive.<br>
For example, when a butyral-based additive is used, pores having a pore diameter of 0.1 µm to 10 µm order can be formed. When starch is used, pores having the same pore<br>
diameter as the grain size of starch and the same shape as starch can be formed. Thus,<br>
when starch is used, the pore diameter and shape of the pores can be more easily<br>
controlled.<br>
[0263]<br>
Specifically, in the case of the ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect, a<br>
vapor deposition material using a butyral-based additive can obtain a deposition speed<br>
about 1.3 times higher than the evaporation speed of the conventional ZnO vapor<br>
deposition material having relative density equal to or greater than about 98%, and a<br>
vapor deposition material using starch having an average grain size of 0.1 to 500 µm can<br>
obtain an evaporation speed about two times higher than the evaporation speed of the<br>
conventional ZnO vapor deposition material having relative density equal to or greater<br>
than about 98%. Therefore, a high speed of film formation can be obtained.<br>
[0264]<br>
In the production process of this aspect, as a fourth step for obtaining a porous<br>
sintered body, a slurry using ZnO powder having a grain size distribution within a<br>
predetermined range is prepared. Specifically, ZnO powder having an average grain<br>
size of 10 to 500 µm and a grain size distribution within a range of ±10% of the average<br>
grain size is used. If the grain size distribution of ZnO powder is outside the range of<br>
±10% of the average grain size, the porosity is lowered. More preferably, the grain size<br>
distribution is within a range of ±5% of the average grain size. The preferred grain size<br>
of CeO2 powder and B2O3 powder is significantly smaller than that of ZnO powder, and<br>
the usage is smaller than that of ZnO powder, so CeO2 powder and B2O3 powder may be<br>
outside the limitation of the grain size distribution.<br>
[0265]<br>
The slurry using ZnO powder with a controlled grain size distribution is<br>
spray-dried. The spray drying is preferably performed at 150 to 250°C for 3 hours by<br>
using a spray drier. In the slurry to be spray-dried, ZnO powder having an average<br>
grain size of 10 to 500 µm and a grain size distribution within a range of ±10% of the<br>
average grain size is used, and no fine ZnO powder is substantially contained. Thus,<br>
there are no cases where fine ZnO grains fill the gaps between ZnO grains, so the gaps<br>
between ZnO grains remain as pores, and granulation powder becomes porous.<br>
Through the spray drying, a porous granulation powder having an average grain size of<br>
50 to 300 µm can be obtained.<br>
[0266]<br>
After the slurry is spray-dried to obtain a granulation powder having an average<br>
grain size of 50 to 300 µm, the granulation powder is molded under a predetermined<br>
pressure. If the average grain size of the granulation powder is smaller than 50 µm,<br>
moldability deteriorates, and if the average grain size is larger than 300 µm, the density<br>
of the molded body is lowered, and the strength is likely to be insufficient.<br>
[0267]<br>
For a pressing molding device, a uniaxial press device, a cold isostatic press<br>
(CIP) molding device, or other devices may be used. The molding pressure is<br>
appropriately in a range of 100 to 2000 kgf/cm2 (9.8 to 196 MPa), and preferably, 100 to<br>
1000 kgf/cm2 (9.8 to 98 MPa). Molding is performed under pressure within the<br>
above-described range, such that the density of the molded body can be increased,<br>
deformation after sintering can be suppressed, and postprocessing is not required.<br>
[0268]<br>
Next, the molded body is sintered. Before sintering, the molded body is<br>
preferably degreased at a temperature of 350 to 620°C. Through this degreasing, spots<br>
on the molded body after sintering can be suppressed. The degreasing is preferably<br>
performed for a sufficient time.<br>
[0269]<br>
Sintering is performed in an atmosphere of air, an inactive gas, a vacuum, or a<br>
reductive gas at a temperature equal to or higher than 1000°C, and preferably, at a<br>
temperature of 1200 to 1400°C for 1 to 10 hours, and preferably, for 2 to 5 hours. The<br>
sintering is performed under air pressure, but in the case of pressure sintering, such as hot<br>
press (HP) sintering or hot isostatic press (HIP) sintering, the sintering is preferably<br>
performed in an atmosphere of inactive gas, vacuum, or reductive gas at a temperature<br>
equal to or higher than 1000°C for 1 to 5 hours.<br>
[0270]<br>
A ZnO film is formed on the surface of the substrate by a vacuum film formation<br>
method with a ZnO vapor deposition material composed of the resultant porous sintered<br>
body as a target material. As the vacuum film formation method suitable for forming a<br>
film using the ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect, an electron beam deposition<br>
method, an ion plating method, a sputtering method, or a plasma deposition method may<br>
be used. A ZnO film of this aspect formed by the film formation method uses the ZnO<br>
vapor deposition material of this aspect, so the ZnO film has high conductivity with<br>
specific resistance of 3 to 5x10-4 Ocm and high permeability with visible light<br>
permeability equal to or greater than 90%, like ITO. Crystals distorted by Ce having an<br>
ion radius larger than Zn are recovered and aligned by adding B having a small ion radius,<br>
such that the durability of the film is improved.<br>
[0271]<br>
According to the production process of this aspect, in any of the first step of<br>
mixing gas in the slurry, the second step of preparing the foaming agent-containing slurry,<br>
the third step of preparing the slurry containing the additive which will be volatized and<br>
dissolved upon sintering, and the fourth step of preparing the slurry using ZnO powder<br>
having a grain size distribution within a predetermined range, the porosity, pore diameter,<br>
and pore shape can be easily controlled. Therefore, a vapor deposition material having<br>
optimum pores can be produced. As a result, even when a large number of pore states<br>
are required by the production conditions or the like, an optimum vapor deposition<br>
material can be provided to cope with the requirements.<br>
[0272]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect is composed mainly of a porous<br>
sintered body having a porosity of 5 to 30% and a pore diameter of 0.1 to 500 µm, so<br>
when a ZnO transparent conductive film is formed by an electron beam deposition<br>
method or an ion plating method using the ZnO vapor deposition material, the<br>
evaporation speed can be improved. That is, when film formation is performed with the<br>
same electron beam energy, the speed of film formation increases, and the operation time<br>
is shortened, thereby increasing the number of products for a predetermined time.<br>
Further, when film formation is performed at the same film formation speed, electron<br>
beam energy is reduced, and the replacement timing of a filament of an electron gun or<br>
the like is delayed, such that the number of times of maintenance is reduced and<br>
productivity is improved. As a result, production costs can be reduced.<br>
[0273]<br>
Next, another aspect of the present invention will be described.<br>
[ZnO vapor deposition material]<br>
A ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect is a ZnO vapor deposition<br>
material for formation of a transparent conductive film which is composed of a sintered<br>
body containing ZnO as a major component, wherein the sintered body contains La as a<br>
first additive element and a second additive element, the second additive element is one<br>
or more elements selected from the group consisting of B, Al, Ga, and Sc, the La content<br>
is in a range of 0.1 to 14.9% by mass, the content of the second additive element is in a<br>
range of 0.1 to 10% by mass, the La content is higher than the content of the second<br>
additive element, and the sintered body is a porous sintered body having a porosity of 3<br>
to 50%.<br>
[0274]<br>
The inventors have investigated in detail the effect on conductivity due to<br>
additive species and its content in a ZnO vapor deposition material and a ZnO film<br>
formed by using the vapor deposition material, and have found that there is a significant<br>
level of influence on conductivity due to the species and content of La as an additive<br>
element and B, Al, Ga, or Sc in the porous ZnO sintered body. Based on the<br>
above-described knowledge, the ZnO vapor deposition material according to this aspect<br>
contains ZnO as a major component, and also contains La as a first additive element and<br>
the second additive element, such that excess electrons contributing to conduction are<br>
developed in large amounts and maintained, thereby forming a ZnO film having high<br>
conductivity.<br>
[0275]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect contains La as a first additive<br>
element and the second additive element together, and the second additive element is one<br>
or more elements selected from B, Al, Ga, and Sc. Of the second additive elements, B,<br>
Al, and Ga have an ion radius smaller than La as a first additive element, so crystals<br>
distorted by the addition of La having an ion radius larger than Zn are recovered and<br>
aligned by adding B, Al, or Ga, or the crystal structure distorted by the addition of La is<br>
recovered and aligned by adding Sc having high reactivity as the second additive element.<br>
For this reason, a ZnO film having high permeability, excellent denseness, high<br>
conductivity, and excellent durability can be formed.<br>
[0276]<br>
As the ratio of La as a first additive element and the second additive element in<br>
the porous ZnO sintered body increases within a predetermined range, the conductivity of<br>
the ZnO film becomes better, and if the ratio is outside the range, the conductivity<br>
adversely deteriorates. Specifically, the La content in the ZnO vapor deposition<br>
material is appropriately in a range of 0.1 to 14.9% by mass, and preferably, in a range of<br>
3 to 6% by mass. If the La content is lower than the lower limit value, 0.1 % by mass,<br>
the conductivity is significantly lowered. If the La content exceeds the upper limit<br>
value, 14.9% by mass, the permeability is significantly lowered.<br>
[0277]<br>
The content of the second additive element in the ZnO vapor deposition material<br>
is appropriately in a range of 0.1 to 10% by mass, and preferably, in a range of 1 to 3%<br>
by mass. If the content of the second additive element is lower than the lower limit<br>
value, 0.1% by mass, the conductivity is significantly lowered. If the content of the<br>
second additive element exceeds the upper limit value, 10% by mass, compositional shift<br>
at the time of deposition occurs.<br>
[0278]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect contains a larger amount of La<br>
as a first additive element than the second additive element, such that a dense crystal<br>
structure is maintained. If the La content is lower than that of the second additive<br>
element, the conductivity and permeability are lowered. The total content of Ce as a<br>
first additive element and the second additive element is preferably in a range of 0.2 to<br>
15% by mass. If the total content of La and the second additive element exceeds this<br>
range, the specific resistance and permeability of the ZnO vapor deposition material are<br>
significantly lowered.<br>
[0279]<br>
When a very small amount of La as a first additive element and the second<br>
additive element is contained in the ZnO vapor deposition material, La as a first additive<br>
element and the second additive element do not exist as granular precipitates in grain<br>
boundaries or grains in the ZnO matrix but are uniformly dispersed in the ZnO vapor<br>
deposition material. It is considered that, in the ZnO vapor deposition material, the first<br>
additive element and the second additive element are present as oxides.<br>
[0280]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect contains La, which is a trivalent<br>
rare earth element, as a first additive element, and La causes excess carrier electrons to be<br>
generated with respect to divalent Zn, such that high conductivity can be ensured.<br>
When a rare earth element is added to the ZnO vapor deposition material, compositional<br>
shift at the time of deposition is unlikely to occur, and a desired composition ratio can be<br>
maintained when a film is formed.<br>
[0281]<br>
According to the ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect, the conductivity is<br>
obtained by oxygen defect as well as compulsive injection of carrier electrons. Usually,<br>
oxygen gas is introduced in a vapor deposition method, but generally oxygen in the film<br>
composition is insufficient. At the time of transparent conductive film formation, a<br>
technique is conventionally used in which resistance is lowered by generating oxygen<br>
defect. However, in the case of adding a rare earth element, it is easy to control because<br>
the element is excellent in evaporation performance. In addition to this advantage by<br>
the addition of La which is a rare earth element, since the ZnO vapor deposition material<br>
of this aspect contains the second additive element, high conductivity like ITO can be<br>
obtained.<br>
[0282]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect is composed of a porous ZnO<br>
sintered body having a porosity of 3 to 50%. The porosity of the sintered body is<br>
appropriately in a range of 3 to 50%, preferably in a range of 5 to 30%, more preferably<br>
in a range of 10 to 30%, and still more preferably in a range of 20 to 30%. If the<br>
porosity is smaller than 3%, it is not preferable since, at the time of film formation by an<br>
electron beam deposition method or an ion plating method, the evaporation speed of the<br>
vapor deposition material does not increase, and as a result, the speed of film formation<br>
decreases, which results in an increase in production costs. If the porosity exceeds 50%,<br>
the strength of the porous sintered body is lowered, and it is difficult to obtain sufficient<br>
mechanical strength. If the porosity is equal to or greater than 10%, the evaporation<br>
speed can be improved. Further, if the porosity is equal to or greater than 20%, a vapor<br>
deposition material having an evaporation speed about two times higher than the<br>
conventional ZnO vapor deposition material can be obtained.<br>
[0283]<br>
In the porous ZnO sintered body of this aspect, the pores preferably have an<br>
average pore diameter of 0.1 to 500 µm. If the average pore diameter of the pores is<br>
within the above-described range, the evaporation speed can be further increased. If the<br>
pore diameter is smaller than 0.1 µm, there is no merit in the pores. If the pore diameter<br>
exceeds 500 µm, it is not preferable because the strength of the sintered body is lowered,<br>
which causes damages due to EB (electron beam) irradiation, that is, splash.<br>
[0284]<br>
The term "pore diameter" (the inner diameter of the pore) refers to, for example,<br>
the maximum value of the internal dimensions in the pores when the sectional portion of<br>
the vapor deposition material is observed by observation means, such as SEM or the like.<br>
As the evaluation method of the pores, measurement of porosity by a substitution method,<br>
measurement of porosity by microscopy, measurement of surface area and micropore<br>
distribution by gas absorption, measurement of surface area and micropore distribution<br>
by a mercury intrusion method, measurement of surface area by a gas permeation method,<br>
or measurement of micropore distribution by an X-ray small-angle scattering method<br>
may be used.<br>
[0285]<br>
The pores are preferably rounded, and in terms of improvement in the<br>
evaporation speed, micropores are preferably formed at the surface of the pores. For the<br>
evaluation method of the pores, the surface area is preferably in a range of 5 to 40 m /g,<br>
and at least one peak of the micropore distribution is present within a range of 1 to 100 µm. Portions (frame portion) other than the pores are preferably substantially sintered.<br>
For example, the frame portion of the porous sintered body preferably has a density equal<br>
to or greater than 98%.<br>
[0286]<br>
In the porous ZnO sintered body of this aspect, it is preferable that grains<br>
preferably have an average crystal grain size of 1 to 500 µm, and rounded pores of about<br>
0.1 to 500 µm are provided in the sintered body. The porous ZnO sintered body has a<br>
fine crystal structure in which the average crystal grain size is within the above-described<br>
range, and the occurrence of defects in the boundary of crystal grains can be reduced.<br>
Thus, the formed ZnO film has excellent film characteristics, such as ZnO film density,<br>
thickness distribution, refractive index, sputtering resistance, discharge characteristics<br>
(discharge voltage, discharge responsiveness, and the like), insulation characteristics, and<br>
the like. If the average crystal grain size is smaller than 1 µm, the speed of film<br>
formation is lowered. If the average crystal grain size exceeds 500 µm, the deposition<br>
rate of the additive element is not uniform. The average crystal grain size is preferably<br>
in a range of 5 to 40 µm, and more preferably, in a range of 10 to 30 µm.<br>
[0287]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect is preferably molded in the<br>
form of disc-like or circular pellets. When the vapor deposition material has a circular<br>
shape, the diameter of the vapor deposition material is appropriately in a range of 5 to 30<br>
mm, and preferably, in a range of 5 to 15 mm. This is because, if the diameter is<br>
excessively small and smaller than 5 mm, splash occurs, and if the diameter exceeds 30<br>
mm, it is difficult to handle the vapor deposition material in an actual production process.<br>
When the vapor deposition material is disc-like, the diameter of the vapor deposition<br>
material is appropriately in a range of 5 to 20 mm, and preferably, in a range of 5 to 10<br>
mm. The height of the vapor deposition material is in a range of 1 to 10 mm, and<br>
preferably, in a range of 2 to 5 mm. This is because, if the diameter is excessively small<br>
and smaller than 5 mm or the height is excessively small and smaller than 1 mm, splash<br>
occurs, and if the diameter exceeds 30 mm or the height exceeds 10 mm, it is difficult to<br>
handle the vapor deposition material in an actual production process.<br>
[0288]<br>
Hereinafter, a process for producing a ZnO vapor deposition material according<br>
to this aspect will be described.<br>
[Production Process]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material according to this aspect can be produced by<br>
mixing ZnO powder having a purity equal to or greater than 98%, La2O3 powder in such<br>
an amount that the La content in the ZnO vapor deposition material is in a range of 0.1 to<br>
14.9% by mass, an oxide powder of a second additive element in such an amount that the<br>
content of the second additive element in the ZnO vapor deposition material is in a range<br>
of 0.1 to 10% by mass, a binder, and an organic solvent to prepare a slurry with a<br>
concentration of 30 to 75% by mass, blowing gas into the slurry to obtain a<br>
gas-containing slurry, spray-drying the gas-containing slurry to obtain a porous<br>
granulation powder having an average grain size of 50 to 300 µm, molding the porous<br>
granulation powder to obtain a porous molded body, and sintering the porous molded<br>
body at a predetermined temperature to obtain a porous ZnO sintered body.<br>
[0289]<br>
The ZnO powder preferably has purity equal to or greater than 98%, more<br>
preferably, equal to or greater than 98.4%, and still more preferably, equal to or greater<br>
than 99%. If the ZnO powder has purity equal to or greater than 98%, reduction of<br>
conductivity by the effect of impurities can be suppressed. The average grain size of<br>
the ZnO powder is in a range of 0.1 to 10 µm. When the average grain size of the ZnO<br>
powder is smaller than 0.1 µm, the powder is excessively fine and aggregated, so there is<br>
a tendency that the handling of the powder becomes worse, and it is difficult to prepare a<br>
high-concentration slurry. When the average grain size exceeds 10 µm, there is a<br>
tendency that it is difficult to control the micro-structure, and a dense pellet is hard to<br>
obtain. If the average grain size of the ZnO powder is adjusted to the above-described<br>
range, a desired sintered body is also obtained without using a sintering auxiliary agent.<br>
[0290]<br>
With regard to the La2O3 powder, considering the prevention of maldistribution<br>
of the La powder, reactivity with a ZnO matrix, and the purity of a La compound, it is<br>
preferable to add La oxide grains whose primary grain size is of a nanometer scale. The<br>
oxide powder of the second additive element preferably has an average grain size of 0.01<br>
to 1 µm, and still more preferably, the average grain size is in a range of 0.05 to 0.5 µm.<br>
If the oxide powder of the second additive element having this average grain size is used,<br>
it is beneficial in terms of the uniform dispersion of the oxide powder of the second<br>
additive element.<br>
[0291]<br>
For a binder, polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl butyral, or the like may be used. It<br>
is preferable to add the binder at 0.2 to 2.5% by mass. For an organic solvent, ethanol,<br>
propanol, or the like may be used.<br>
[0292]<br>
The raw powder, the binder, and the organic solvent are mixed to prepare a slurry<br>
with a concentration of 30 to 75% by mass, and preferably, 40 to 65% by mass. If the<br>
slurry concentration exceeds 75% by mass, since the slurry is a non-aqueous system,<br>
stable granulation is difficult. If the slurry concentration is less than 30% by mass, it is<br>
difficult to obtain a dense ZnO sintered body having a uniform composition. If the<br>
slurry concentration is adjusted within the above-described range, the viscosity of the<br>
slurry is in a range of 200 to 1000 cps. Therefore, powder granulation using a spray<br>
drier can be performed stably. Further, the density of a molded body increases, such<br>
that a dense sintered body can be obtained.<br>
[0293]<br>
Wet blending of raw powder, a binder, and an organic solvent, and in particular,<br>
wet blending of raw powder and an organic solvent as a dispersion medium is preferably<br>
performed by a wet ball mill or a stirring mill. In the case of using a ZrO2 ball in the<br>
wet ball mill, wet blending is preferably performed using a large number of ZrO2 balls<br>
having a diameter of 5 to 10 mm for 8 to 24 hours, and preferably, for 20 to 24 hours. If<br>
the diameter of the ZrO2 ball is smaller than 5 mm, blending may be insufficient. If the<br>
diameter of the ZrO2 ball exceeds 10 mm, impurities are increased. Even though the<br>
blending time is long, up to 24 hours, impurities are hardly generated due to milling.<br>
On the other hand, when a resin ball with a metal support is used in the wet ball mill, a<br>
ball having a diameter of 10 to 15 mm is preferably used.<br>
[0294]<br>
In the stirring mill, wet blending is preferably performed using a ZrO2 ball having<br>
a diameter of 1 to 3 mm for 0.5 to 1 hour. If the diameter of the ZrO2 ball is smaller<br>
than 1 mm, blending is insufficient. If the diameter exceeds 3 mm, impurities are<br>
increased. If the blending time exceeds 1 hour, while raw materials are mixed, milling<br>
leads to the generation of impurities. Sufficient blending can be done within 1 hour.<br>
Blending/granulation of powder and additives may be performed by a general tumbling<br>
granulation method. In this case, it is not necessary to perform a separation operation<br>
from the balls or the like after the process, and thus the process is simplified.<br>
[0295]<br>
In the production process of this aspect, as a first step for obtaining a porous<br>
sintered body, gas is blown and mixed into the slurry to prepare a gas-containing slurry.<br>
Gas blowing and mixing is preferably performed by blowing using a mechanical pump,<br>
gas pressure, or the like. As the gas, air, an insoluble gas, a non-aqueous gas, or the like<br>
may be used.<br>
[0296]<br>
The gas-containing slurry is spray-dried. The spray drying is preferably<br>
performed at 150 to 250°C for 3 hours by using a spray drier. Since gas is blown into<br>
the slurry, the granulation powder obtained by spray-drying the slurry is porous.<br>
Through the spray drying, a porous granulation powder having an average grain size of<br>
50 to 300 µm can be obtained.<br>
[0297]<br>
In the production process of this aspect, as a second step for obtaining a porous<br>
sintered body, a slurry is prepared in which a foaming agent is mixed. For the foaming<br>
agent, an organic foaming agent or an inorganic foaming agent may be used. For the<br>
organic foaming agent, azodicarboxylamide, dinitrosobenta methylene tetramine, or the<br>
like is used, and for the inorganic foaming agent, carbonate or the like is used. The<br>
foaming agent may be mixed with ZnO powder, LaO2 powder, and Al2O3 powder, or may<br>
be added upon slurry preparation.<br>
[0298]<br>
The foaming agent-containing slurry is spray-dried. The spray drying is<br>
preferably performed at 150 to 250°C for 3 hours by using a spray drier. The foaming<br>
agent contained in the slurry is foamed and dissolved upon this spray drying, such that<br>
resultant granulation powder is made porous. Through the spray drying, a porous<br>
granulation powder having an average grain size of 50 to 300 µm can be obtained.<br>
[0299]<br>
In the production process of this aspect, as a third step for obtaining a porous<br>
sintered body, a slurry is prepared in which an additive, which will be volatized and<br>
dissolved upon sintering, is mixed. Examples of the additive include butyral capable of<br>
being dissolved in a solvent, and a cellulose-based additive, a polyvinyl-based additive, a<br>
polyester-based additive, a polyethylene-based additive, and the like capable of being<br>
dissolved in an alcohol-based solvent. Examples of the additive which will not be<br>
dissolved in the alcohol-based solvent include a starch-based additive and a<br>
polystyrene-based additive having an average grain size of about several µm to 500 µm.<br>
It is preferable that butyral is mixed in the slurry at about 20% by mass, or starch is<br>
mixed in the slurry at about 20% by mass.<br>
[0300]<br>
If the slurry contains the additive, the additive is volatized and dissolved upon<br>
sintering to form pores, thereby obtaining a porous sintered body. The diameter and<br>
shape of the pores can be controlled by adjusting the kind and amount of the additive.<br>
For example, when a butyral-based additive is used, pores having a pore diameter of 0.1 µm to 10 µm order can be formed. When starch is used, pores having the same pore<br>
diameter as the grain size of starch and the same shape as starch can be formed. Thus,<br>
when starch is used, the pore diameter and shape of the pores can be more easily<br>
controlled.<br>
[0301]<br>
Specifically, in the case of the ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect, a<br>
vapor deposition material using a butyral-based additive can obtain a deposition speed<br>
about 1.3 times higher than the evaporation speed of the conventional ZnO vapor<br>
deposition material having relative density equal to or greater than about 98%, and a<br>
vapor deposition material using starch having an average grain size of 0.1 to 500 µm can<br>
obtain an evaporation speed about two times. Therefore, a high speed of film formation<br>
can be obtained.<br>
[0302]<br>
In the production process of this aspect, as a fourth step for obtaining a porous<br>
sintered body, a slurry using ZnO powder having a grain size distribution within a<br>
predetermined range is prepared. Specifically, ZnO powder having an average grain<br>
size of 10 to 500 µm and a grain size distribution within a range of ±10% of the average<br>
grain size is used. If the grain size distribution of ZnO powder is outside the range of<br>
±10% of the average grain size, the porosity is lowered. More preferably, the grain size<br>
distribution is within a range of ±5% of the average grain size. The preferred grain size<br>
of oxide powder of the first additive element and the second additive element is<br>
significantly smaller than that of ZnO powder, and the usage is smaller than that of ZnO<br>
powder, so oxide powder of the first additive element and the second additive element<br>
may be outside the limitation of the grain size distribution.<br>
[0303]<br>
The slurry using ZnO powder with a controlled grain size distribution is<br>
spray-dried. The spray drying is preferably performed at 150 to 250°C for 3 hours by<br>
using a spray drier. In the slurry to be spray-dried, ZnO powder having an average<br>
grain size of 10 to 500 µm and a grain size distribution within a range of ±10% of the<br>
average grain size is used, and no fine ZnO powder is substantially contained. Thus,<br>
there are no cases where fine ZnO grains fill the gaps between ZnO grains, so the gaps<br>
between ZnO grains remain as pores, and granulation powder becomes porous.<br>
Through the spray drying, a porous granulation powder having an average grain size of<br>
50 to 300 µm can be obtained.<br>
[0304]<br>
After the slurry is spray-dried to obtain a granulation powder having an average<br>
grain size of 50 to 300 µm, the granulation powder is molded under a predetermined<br>
pressure. If the average grain size of the granulation powder is smaller than 50 µm,<br>
moldability deteriorates, and if the average grain size is larger than 300 µm, the density<br>
of the molded body is lowered, and the strength is likely to be insufficient.<br>
[0305]<br>
For a pressing molding device, a uniaxial press device, a cold isostatic press<br>
(CIP) molding device, or other devices may be used. The molding pressure is<br>
appropriately in a range of 100 to 2000 kgf/cm2 (9.8 to 196 MPa), and preferably, 100 to<br>
1000 kgf/cm (9.8 to 98 MPa). Molding is performed under pressure within the<br>
above-described range, such that the density of the molded body can be increased,<br>
deformation after sintering can be suppressed, and postprocessing is not required.<br>
[0306]<br>
Next, the molded body is sintered. Before sintering, the molded body is<br>
preferably degreased at a temperature of 350 to 620°C. Through this degreasing, spots<br>
on the molded body after sintering can be suppressed. The degreasing is preferably<br>
performed for a sufficient time.<br>
[0307]<br>
Sintering is performed in an atmosphere of air, an inactive gas, a vacuum, or a<br>
reductive gas at a temperature equal to or higher than 1000°C, and preferably, at a<br>
temperature of 1200 to 1400°C for 1 to 10 hours, and preferably, for 2 to 5 hours. The<br>
sintering is performed under air pressure, but in the case of pressure sintering, such as hot<br>
press (HP) sintering or hot isostatic press (HIP) sintering, the sintering is preferably<br>
performed in an atmosphere of inactive gas, vacuum, or reductive gas at a temperature<br>
equal to or higher than 1000°C for 1 to 5 hours.<br>
[0308]<br>
A ZnO film is formed on the surface of the substrate by a vacuum film formation<br>
method with a ZnO vapor deposition material composed of the resultant porous sintered<br>
body as a target material. As the vacuum film formation method suitable for forming a<br>
film using the ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect, an electron beam deposition<br>
method, an ion plating method, a sputtering method, or a plasma deposition method may<br>
be used. A ZnO film of this aspect formed by the film formation method uses the ZnO<br>
vapor deposition material of this aspect, so the ZnO film has high conductivity with<br>
specific resistance of 3 to 5x10-4 O-cm and high permeability with visible light<br>
permeability equal to or greater than 90%, like ITO.<br>
[0309]<br>
In the ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect, the crystal structure distorted<br>
by the addition of La having an ion radius larger than Zn is recovered and aligned by<br>
addition of the second additive element having a small ion radius, such as B, Al, or Ga,<br>
or Sc having high reactivity is added to recover a film having a regulated crystal structure.<br>
Therefore, a dense film can be formed, and the durability of the film can also be<br>
improved.<br>
[0310]<br>
According to the production process of this aspect, in any of the first step of<br>
mixing gas in the slurry, the second step of preparing the foaming agent-containing slurry,<br>
the third step of preparing the slurry containing the additive which will be volatized and<br>
dissolved upon sintering, and the fourth step of preparing the slurry using ZnO powder<br>
having a grain size distribution within a predetermined range, the porosity, pore diameter,<br>
and pore shape can be easily controlled. Therefore, a vapor deposition material having<br>
optimum pores can be produced. As a result, even when a large number of pore states<br>
are required by the production conditions or the like, an optimum vapor deposition<br>
material can be provided to cope with the requirements.<br>
[0311]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect is composed mainly of a porous<br>
sintered body having a porosity of 5 to 30% and a pore diameter of 0.1 to 500 µm, so<br>
when a ZnO transparent conductive film is formed by an electron beam deposition<br>
method or an ion plating method using the ZnO vapor deposition material, the<br>
evaporation speed can be improved. That is, when film formation is performed with the<br>
same electron beam energy, the speed of film formation increases, and the operation time<br>
is shortened, thereby increasing the number of products for a predetermined time.<br>
Further, when film formation is performed at the same film formation speed, electron<br>
beam energy is reduced, and the replacement timing of a filament of an electron gun or<br>
the like is delayed, such that the number of times of maintenance is reduced and<br>
productivity is improved. As a result, production costs can be reduced.<br>
[0312]<br>
Next, another aspect of the present invention will be described.<br>
[ZnO vapor deposition material]<br>
A ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect is a ZnO vapor deposition<br>
material for formation of a transparent conductive film which is composed of a sintered<br>
body containing ZnO as a major component, wherein the sintered body contains Y as a<br>
first additive element and a second additive element, the second additive element is one<br>
or more elements selected from the group consisting of B, Al, Ga, and Sc, the Y content<br>
is in a range of 0.1 to 14.9% by mass, the content of the second additive element is in a<br>
range of 0.1 to 10% by mass, the Y content is higher than the content of the second<br>
additive element, and the sintered body is a porous sintered body having a porosity of 3<br>
to 50%.<br>
[0313]<br>
The inventors have investigated in detail the effect on conductivity due to<br>
additive species and the content in a ZnO vapor deposition material and a ZnO film<br>
formed by using the vapor deposition material, and have found that there is a significant<br>
level of influence on conductivity due to the species and content of Y as a first additive<br>
element and the second additive element, such as B, Al, Ga, or Sc, in the porous ZnO<br>
sintered body. Based on the above-described knowledge, the ZnO vapor deposition<br>
material according to this aspect contains ZnO as a major component, and also contains<br>
Y as a first additive element and the second additive element, such that excess electrons<br>
contributing to conduction are developed in large amounts and maintained, thereby<br>
forming a ZnO film having high conductivity.<br>
[0314]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect contains Y as a first additive<br>
element and the second additive element together, and the second additive element is one<br>
or more elements selected from B, Al, Ga, and Sc. Of the second additive elements, B,<br>
Al, and Ga have an ion radius smaller than Y as a first additive element, so crystals<br>
distorted by the addition of Y having an ion radius larger than Zn are recovered and<br>
aligned by adding B, Al, or Ga, or the crystal structure distorted by the addition of Y is<br>
recovered and aligned by adding Sc having high reactivity as the second additive element.<br>
For this reason, a ZnO film having high permeability, excellent denseness, high<br>
conductivity, and excellent durability can be formed.<br>
[0315]<br>
As the ratio of Y as a first additive element and the second additive element in the<br>
porous ZnO sintered body increases within a predetermined range, the conductivity of the<br>
ZnO film becomes better, and if the ratio is outside the range, the conductivity adversely<br>
deteriorates. Specifically, the Y content in the ZnO vapor deposition material is<br>
appropriately in a range of 0.1 to 14.9% by mass, and preferably, in a range of 3 to 6% by<br>
mass. If the Y content is lower than the lower limit value, 0.1% by mass, the<br>
conductivity is significantly lowered. If the Y content exceeds the upper limit value,<br>
14.9% by mass, the permeability is significantly lowered.<br>
[0316]<br>
The content of the second additive element in the ZnO vapor deposition material<br>
is appropriately in a range of 0.1 to 10% by mass, and preferably, in a range of 1 to 3%<br>
by mass. If the content of the second additive element is lower than the lower limit<br>
value, 0.1% by mass, the conductivity is significantly lowered. If the content of the<br>
second additive element exceeds the upper limit value, 10% by mass, compositional shift<br>
at the time of deposition occurs.<br>
[0317]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect contains a larger amount of Y as<br>
a first additive element than the second additive element, such that a dense crystal<br>
structure is maintained. If the Y content is lower than that of the second additive<br>
element, the conductivity and permeability are lowered. The total content of Y as a first<br>
additive element and the second additive element is preferably in a range of 0.2 to 15%<br>
by mass. If the total content of Y and the second additive element exceeds this range,<br>
the specific resistance and permeability of the ZnO vapor deposition material are<br>
significantly lowered.<br>
[0318]<br>
When a very small amount of Y as a first additive element and the second<br>
additive element is contained in the ZnO vapor deposition material, Y as a first additive<br>
element and the second additive element do not exist as granular precipitates in grain<br>
boundaries or grains in the ZnO matrix but are uniformly dispersed in the ZnO vapor<br>
deposition material. It is considered that, in the ZnO vapor deposition material, the first<br>
additive element and the second additive element are present as oxides.<br>
[0319]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect contains Y, which is a trivalent<br>
rare earth element, as a first additive element, and Y causes excess carrier electrons to be<br>
generated with respect to divalent Zn, such that high conductivity can be ensured.<br>
When a rare earth element is added to the ZnO vapor deposition material, compositional<br>
shift at the time of deposition is unlikely to occur, and a desired composition ratio can be<br>
maintained when a film is formed.<br>
[0320]<br>
According to the ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect, the conductivity is<br>
obtained by oxygen defect as well as compulsive injection of carrier electrons. Usually,<br>
oxygen gas is introduced in a vapor deposition method, but generally oxygen in the film<br>
composition is insufficient. At the time of transparent conductive film formation, a<br>
technique is conventionally used in which resistance is lowered by generating oxygen<br>
defect. However, in the case of adding a rare earth element, it is easy to control because<br>
the element is excellent in evaporation performance. In addition to this advantage by<br>
the addition of Y which is a rare earth element, since the ZnO vapor deposition material<br>
of this aspect contains the second additive element, high conductivity like ITO can be<br>
obtained.<br>
[0321]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect is composed of a porous ZnO<br>
sintered body having a porosity of 3 to 50%. The porosity of the sintered body is<br>
appropriately in a range of 3 to 50%, preferably in a range of 5 to 30%, more preferably<br>
in a range of 10 to 30%, and still more preferably in a range of 20 to 30%. If the<br>
porosity is smaller than 3%, it is not preferable since, at the time of film formation by an<br>
electron beam deposition method or an ion plating method, the evaporation speed of the<br>
vapor deposition material does not increase, and as a result, the speed of film formation<br>
decreases, which results in an increase in production costs. If the porosity exceeds 50%,<br>
the strength of the porous sintered body is lowered, and it is difficult to obtain sufficient<br>
mechanical strength. If the porosity is equal to or greater than 10%, the evaporation<br>
speed can be improved. Further, if the porosity is equal to or greater than 20%, a vapor<br>
deposition material having an evaporation speed about two times higher than the<br>
conventional ZnO vapor deposition material can be obtained.<br>
[0322]<br>
In the porous ZnO sintered body of this aspect, the pores preferably have an<br>
average pore diameter of 0.1 to 500 µm. If the average pore diameter of the pores is<br>
within the above-described range, the evaporation speed can be further increased. If the<br>
pore diameter is smaller than 0.1 µm, there is no merit in the pores. If the pore diameter<br>
exceeds 500 µm, it is not preferable because the strength of the sintered body is lowered,<br>
which causes damages due to EB (electron beam) irradiation, that is, splash.<br>
[0323]<br>
The term "pore diameter" (the inner diameter of the pore) refers to, for example,<br>
the maximum value of the internal dimensions in the pores when the sectional portion of<br>
the vapor deposition material is observed by observation means, such as SEM or the like.<br>
As the evaluation method of the pores, measurement of porosity by a substitution method,<br>
measurement of porosity by microscopy, measurement of surface area and micropore<br>
distribution by gas absorption, measurement of surface area and micropore distribution<br>
by a mercury intrusion method, measurement of surface area by a gas permeation method,<br>
or measurement of micropore distribution by an X-ray small-angle scattering method<br>
may be used.<br>
[0324]<br>
The pores are preferably rounded, and in terms of improvement in the<br>
evaporation speed, micropores are preferably formed at the surface of the pores. For the<br>
evaluation method of the pores, the surface area is preferably in a range of 5 to 40 m2/g,<br>
and at least one peak of the micropore distribution is present within a range of 1 to 100 µm. Portions (frame portion) other than the pores are preferably substantially sintered.<br>
For example, the frame portion of the porous sintered body preferably has a density equal<br>
to or greater than 98%.<br>
[0325]<br>
In the porous ZnO sintered body of this aspect, it is preferable that grains<br>
preferably have an average crystal grain size of 1 to 500 µm, and rounded pores of about<br>
0.1 to 500 µm are provided in the sintered body. The porous ZnO sintered body has a<br>
fine crystal structure in which the average crystal grain size is within the above-described<br>
range, and the occurrence of defects in the boundary of crystal grains can be reduced.<br>
Thus, the formed ZnO film has excellent film characteristics, such as ZnO film density,<br>
thickness distribution, refractive index, sputtering resistance, discharge characteristics<br>
(discharge voltage, discharge responsiveness, and the like), insulation characteristics, and<br>
the like. If the average crystal grain size is smaller than 1 µm, the speed of film<br>
formation is lowered. If the average crystal grain size exceeds 500 µm, the deposition<br>
rate of the additive element is not uniform. The average crystal grain size is preferably<br>
in a range of 5 to 40 µm, and more preferably, in a range of 10 to 30 µm.<br>
[0326]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect is preferably molded in the<br>
form of disc-like or circular pellets. When the vapor deposition material has a circular<br>
shape, the diameter of the vapor deposition material is appropriately in a range of 5 to 30<br>
mm, and preferably, in a range of 5 to 15 mm. This is because, if the diameter is<br>
excessively small and smaller than 5 mm, splash occurs, and if the diameter exceeds 30<br>
mm, it is difficult to handle the vapor deposition material in an actual production process.<br>
When the vapor deposition material is disc-like, the diameter of the vapor deposition<br>
material is appropriately in a range of 5 to 20 mm, and preferably, in a range of 5 to 10<br>
mm. The height of the vapor deposition material is in a range of 1 to 10 mm, and<br>
preferably, in a range of 2 to 5 mm. This is because, if the diameter is excessively small<br>
and smaller than 5 mm or the height is excessively small and smaller than 1 mm, splash<br>
occurs, and if the diameter exceeds 30 mm or the height exceeds 10 mm, it is difficult to<br>
handle the vapor deposition material in an actual production process.<br>
[0327]<br>
Hereinafter, a process for producing a ZnO vapor deposition material according<br>
to this aspect will be described.<br>
[Production Process]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material according to this aspect can be produced by<br>
mixing ZnO powder having a purity equal to or greater than 98%, Y2O3 powder in such<br>
an amount that the Y content in the ZnO vapor deposition material is in a range of 0.1 to<br>
14.9% by mass, an oxide powder of a second additive element in such an amount that the<br>
content of the second additive element in the ZnO vapor deposition material is in a range<br>
of 0.1 to 10% by mass, a binder, and an organic solvent to prepare a slurry with a<br>
concentration of 30 to 75% by mass, blowing gas into the slurry to obtain a<br>
gas-containing slurry, spray-drying the gas-containing slurry to obtain a porous<br>
granulation powder having an average grain size of 50 to 300 µm, molding the porous<br>
granulation powder to obtain a porous molded body, and sintering the porous molded<br>
body at a predetermined temperature to obtain a porous ZnO sintered body.<br>
[0328]<br>
The ZnO powder preferably has purity equal to or greater than 98%, more<br>
preferably, equal to or greater than 98.4%, and still more preferably, equal to or greater<br>
than 99%. If the ZnO powder has purity equal to or greater than 98%, reduction of<br>
conductivity by the effect of impurities can be suppressed. The average grain size of<br>
the ZnO powder is in a range of 0.1 to 10 µm. When the average grain size of the ZnO<br>
powder is smaller than 0.1 µm, the powder is excessively fine and aggregated, so there is<br>
a tendency that the handling of the powder becomes worse, and it is difficult to prepare a<br>
high-concentration slurry. When the average grain size exceeds 10 µm, there is a<br>
tendency that it is difficult to control the micro-structure, and a dense pellet is hard to<br>
obtain. If the average grain size of the ZnO powder is adjusted to the above-described<br>
range, a desired sintered body is also obtained without using a sintering auxiliary agent.<br>
[0329]<br>
With regard to the Y2O3 powder, considering the prevention of maldistribution of<br>
the Y powder, reactivity with a ZnO matrix, and the purity of a Y compound, it is<br>
preferable to add Y oxide grains whose primary grain size is of a nanometer scale. The<br>
oxide powder of the second additive element preferably has an average grain size of 0.01<br>
to 1 µm, and still more preferably, the average grain size is in a range of 0.05 to 0.5 µm.<br>
If the oxide powder of the second additive element having this average grain size is used,<br>
it is beneficial in terms of the uniform dispersion of the oxide powder of the second<br>
additive element.<br>
[0330]<br>
For a binder, polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl butyral, or the like may be used. It<br>
is preferable to add the binder at 0.2 to 2.5% by mass. For an organic solvent, ethanol,<br>
propanol, or the like may be used.<br>
[0331]<br>
The raw powder, the binder, and the organic solvent are mixed to prepare a slurry<br>
with a concentration of 30 to 75% by mass, and preferably, 40 to 65% by mass. If the<br>
slurry concentration exceeds 75% by mass, since the slurry is a non-aqueous system,<br>
stable granulation is difficult. If the slurry concentration is less than 30% by mass, it is<br>
difficult to obtain a dense ZnO sintered body having a uniform composition. If the<br>
slurry concentration is adjusted within the above-described range, the viscosity of the<br>
slurry is in a range of 200 to 1000 cps. Therefore, powder granulation using a spray<br>
drier can be performed stably. Further, the density of a molded body increases, such<br>
that a dense sintered body can be obtained.<br>
[0332]<br>
Wet blending of raw powder, a binder, and an organic solvent, and in particular,<br>
wet blending of raw powder and an organic solvent as a dispersion medium is preferably<br>
performed by a wet ball mill or a stirring mill. In the case of using a ZrO2 ball in the<br>
wet ball mill, wet blending is preferably performed using a large number of ZrO2 balls<br>
having a diameter of 5 to 10 mm for 8 to 24 hours, and preferably, for 20 to 24 hours. If<br>
the diameter of the ZrO2 ball is smaller than 5 mm, blending may be insufficient. If the<br>
diameter of the ZrO2 ball exceeds 10 mm, impurities are increased. Even though the<br>
blending time is long, up to 24 hours, impurities are hardly generated due to milling.<br>
On the other hand, when a resin ball with a metal support is used in the wet ball mill, a<br>
ball having a diameter of 10 to 15 mm is preferably used.<br>
[0333]<br>
In the stirring mill, wet blending is preferably performed using a ZrO2 ball having<br>
a diameter of 1 to 3 mm for 0.5 to 1 hour. If the diameter of the ZrO2 ball is smaller<br>
than 1 mm, blending is insufficient. If the diameter exceeds 3 mm, impurities are<br>
increased. If the blending time exceeds 1 hour, while raw materials are mixed, milling<br>
leads to the generation of impurities. Sufficient blending can be done within 1 hour.<br>
Blending/granulation of powder and additives may be performed by a general tumbling<br>
granulation method. In this case, it is not necessary to perform a separation operation<br>
from the balls or the like after the process, and thus the process is simplified.<br>
[0334]<br>
In the production process of this aspect, as a first step for obtaining a porous<br>
sintered body, gas is blown and mixed into the slurry to prepare a gas-containing slurry.<br>
Gas blowing and mixing is preferably performed by blowing using a mechanical pump,<br>
gas pressure, or the like. As the gas, air, an insoluble gas, a non-aqueous gas, or the like<br>
may be used.<br>
[0335]<br>
The gas-containing slurry is spray-dried. The spray drying is preferably<br>
performed at 150 to 250°C for 3 hours by using a spray drier. Since gas is blown into<br>
the slurry, the granulation powder obtained by spray-drying the slurry is porous.<br>
Through the spray drying, a porous granulation powder having an average grain size of<br>
50 to 300 µm can be obtained.<br>
[0336]<br>
In the production process of this aspect, as a second step for obtaining a porous<br>
sintered body, a slurry is prepared in which a foaming agent is mixed. For the foaming<br>
agent, an organic foaming agent or an inorganic foaming agent may be used. For the<br>
organic foaming agent, azodicarboxylamide, dinitrosobenta methylene tetramine, or the<br>
like is used, and for the inorganic foaming agent, carbonate or the like is used. The<br>
foaming agent may be mixed with ZnO powder, YO2 powder, and Al2O3 powder, or may<br>
be added upon slurry preparation.<br>
[0337]<br>
The foaming agent-containing slurry is spray-dried. The spray drying is<br>
preferably performed at 150 to 250°C for 3 hours by using a spray drier. The foaming<br>
agent contained in the slurry is foamed and dissolved upon this spray drying, such that<br>
resultant granulation powder is made porous. Through the spray drying, a porous<br>
granulation powder having an average grain size of 50 to 300 µm can be obtained.<br>
[0338]<br>
In the production process of this aspect, as a third step for obtaining a porous<br>
sintered body, a slurry is prepared in which an additive, which will be volatized and<br>
dissolved upon sintering, is mixed. Examples of the additive include butyral capable of<br>
being dissolved in a solvent, and a cellulose-based additive, a polyvinyl-based additive, a<br>
polyester-based additive, a polyethylene-based additive, and the like capable of being<br>
dissolved in an alcohol-based solvent. Examples of the additive which will not be<br>
dissolved in the alcohol-based solvent include a starch-based additive and a<br>
polystyrene-based additive having an average grain size of about several µm to 500 µm.<br>
It is preferable that butyral is mixed in the slurry at about 20% by mass, or starch is<br>
mixed in the slurry at about 20% by mass.<br>
[0339]<br>
If the slurry contains the additive, the additive is volatized and dissolved upon<br>
sintering to form pores, thereby obtaining a porous sintered body. The diameter and<br>
shape of the pores can be controlled by adjusting the kind and amount of the additive.<br>
For example, when a butyral-based additive is used, pores having a pore diameter of 0.1 µm to 10 µm order can be formed. When starch is used, pores having the same pore<br>
diameter as the grain size of starch and the same shape as starch can be formed. Thus,<br>
when starch is used, the pore diameter and shape of the pores can be more easily<br>
controlled.<br>
[0340]<br>
Specifically, in the case of the ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect, a<br>
vapor deposition material using a butyral-based additive can obtain a deposition speed<br>
about 1.3 times higher than the evaporation speed of the conventional ZnO vapor<br>
deposition material having relative density equal to or greater than about 98%, and a<br>
vapor deposition material using starch having an average grain size of 0.1 to 500 µm can<br>
obtain an evaporation speed about two times. Therefore, a high speed of film formation<br>
can be obtained.<br>
[0341]<br>
In the production process of this aspect, as a fourth step for obtaining a porous<br>
sintered body, a slurry using ZnO powder having a grain size distribution within a<br>
predetermined range is prepared. Specifically, ZnO powder having an average grain<br>
size of 10 to 500 µm and a grain size distribution within a range of ±10% of the average<br>
grain size is used. If the grain size distribution of ZnO powder is outside the range of<br>
±10% of the average grain size, the porosity is lowered. More preferably, the grain size<br>
distribution is within a range of ±5% of the average grain size. The preferred grain size<br>
of oxide powder of the first additive element and the second additive element is<br>
significantly smaller than that of ZnO powder, and the usage is smaller than that of ZnO<br>
powder, so oxide powder of the first additive element and the second additive element<br>
may be outside the limitation of the grain size distribution.<br>
[0342]<br>
The slurry using ZnO powder with a controlled grain size distribution is<br>
spray-dried. The spray drying is preferably performed at 150 to 250°C for 3 hours by<br>
using a spray drier. In the slurry to be spray-dried, ZnO powder having an average<br>
grain size of 10 to 500 µm and a grain size distribution within a range of ±10% of the<br>
average grain size is used, and no fine ZnO powder is substantially contained. Thus,<br>
there are no cases where fine ZnO grains fill the gaps between ZnO grains, so the gaps<br>
between ZnO grains remain as pores, and granulation powder becomes porous.<br>
Through the spray drying, a porous granulation powder having an average grain size of<br>
50 to 300 µm can be obtained.<br>
[0343]<br>
After the slurry is spray-dried to obtain a granulation powder having an average<br>
grain size of 50 to 300 µm, the granulation powder is molded under a predetermined<br>
pressure. If the average grain size of the granulation powder is smaller than 50 µm,<br>
moldability deteriorates, and if the average grain size is larger than 300 µm, the density<br>
of the molded body is lowered, and the strength is likely to be insufficient.<br>
[0344]<br>
For a pressing molding device, a uniaxial press device, a cold isostatic press<br>
(CIP) molding device, or other devices may be used. The molding pressure is<br>
appropriately in a range of 100 to 2000 kgf/cm2 (9.8 to 196 MPa), and preferably, 100 to<br>
1000 kgf/cm2 (9.8 to 98 MPa). Molding is performed under pressure within the<br>
above-described range, such that the density of the molded body can be increased,<br>
deformation after sintering can be suppressed, and postprocessing is not required.<br>
[0345]<br>
Next, the molded body is sintered. Before sintering, the molded body is<br>
preferably degreased at a temperature of 350 to 620°C. Through this degreasing, spots<br>
on the molded body after sintering can be suppressed. The degreasing is preferably<br>
performed for a sufficient time.<br>
[0346]<br>
Sintering is performed in an atmosphere of air, an inactive gas, a vacuum, or a<br>
reductive gas at a temperature equal to or higher than 1000°C, and preferably, at a<br>
temperature of 1200 to 1400°C for 1 to 10 hours, and preferably, for 2 to 5 hours. The<br>
sintering is performed under air pressure, but in the case of pressure sintering, such as hot<br>
press (HP) sintering or hot isostatic press (HIP) sintering, the sintering is preferably<br>
performed in an atmosphere of inactive gas, vacuum, or reductive gas at a temperature<br>
equal to or higher than 1000°C for 1 to 5 hours.<br>
[0347]<br>
A ZnO film is formed on the surface of the substrate by a vacuum film formation<br>
method with a ZnO vapor deposition material composed of the resultant porous sintered<br>
body as a target material. As the vacuum film formation method suitable for forming a<br>
film using the ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect, an electron beam deposition<br>
method, an ion plating method, a sputtering method, or a plasma deposition method may<br>
be used. A ZnO film of this aspect formed by the film formation method uses the ZnO<br>
vapor deposition material of this aspect, so the ZnO film has high conductivity with<br>
specific resistance of 3 to 5x10-4 O cm and high permeability with visible light<br>
permeability equal to or greater than 90%, like ITO.<br>
[0348]<br>
In the ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect, the crystal structure distorted<br>
by the addition of Y having an ion radius larger than Zn is recovered and aligned by<br>
addition of the second additive element having a small ion radius, such as B, Al, or Ga,<br>
or Sc having high reactivity is added to recover a film having a regulated crystal structure.<br>
Therefore, a dense film can be formed, and the durability of the film can also be<br>
improved.<br>
[0349]<br>
According to the production process of this aspect, in any of the first step of<br>
mixing gas in the slurry, the second step of preparing the foaming agent-containing slurry,<br>
the third step of preparing the slurry containing the additive which will be volatized and<br>
dissolved upon sintering, and the fourth step of preparing the slurry using ZnO powder<br>
having a grain size distribution within a predetermined range, the porosity, pore diameter,<br>
and pore shape can be easily controlled. Therefore, a vapor deposition material having<br>
optimum pores can be produced. As a result, even when a large number of pore states<br>
are required by the production conditions or the like, an optimum vapor deposition<br>
material can be provided to cope with the requirements.<br>
[0350]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect is composed mainly of a porous<br>
sintered body having a porosity of 5 to 30% and a pore diameter of 0.1 to 500 µm, so<br>
when a ZnO transparent conductive film is formed by an electron beam deposition<br>
method or an ion plating method using the ZnO vapor deposition material, the<br>
evaporation speed can be improved. That is, when film formation is performed with the<br>
same electron beam energy, the speed of film formation increases, and the operation time<br>
is shortened, thereby increasing the number of products for a predetermined time.<br>
Further, when film formation is performed at the same film formation speed, electron<br>
beam energy is reduced, and the replacement timing of a filament of an electron gun or<br>
the like is delayed, such that the number of times of maintenance is reduced and<br>
productivity is improved. As a result, production costs can be reduced.<br>
[0351]<br>
Next, another aspect of the present invention will be described.<br>
[ZnO vapor deposition material]<br>
A ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect is a ZnO vapor deposition<br>
material for formation of a transparent conductive film which is composed of a sintered<br>
body containing ZnO as a major component, wherein the sintered body contains a first<br>
additive element and a second additive element, the first additive element is one or more<br>
elements selected from the group consisting of Pr, Nd, Pm, and Sm, the second additive<br>
element is one or more elements selected from the group consisting of B, Al, Ga, and Sc,<br>
the content of the first additive element is in a range of 0.1 to 14.9% by mass, the content<br>
of the second additive element is in a range of 0.1 to 10% by mass, the content of the first<br>
additive element is higher than the content of the second additive element, and the<br>
sintered body is a porous sintered body having a porosity of 3 to 50%.<br>
[0352]<br>
The inventors have investigated in detail the effect on conductivity due to<br>
additive species and the content in a ZnO vapor deposition material and a ZnO film<br>
formed by using the vapor deposition material, and have found that there is a significant<br>
level of influence on conductivity due to the species and content of one or more first<br>
additive elements selected from the group consisting of Pr, Nd, Pm, and Sm and one or<br>
more second additive elements selected from the group consisting of B, Al, Ga, and Sc in<br>
the porous ZnO sintered body. Based on the above-described knowledge, the ZnO<br>
vapor deposition material according to this aspect contains ZnO as a major component,<br>
and also contains the first additive elements and the second additive elements, such that<br>
excess electrons contributing to conduction are developed in large amounts and<br>
maintained, thereby forming a ZnO film having high conductivity.<br>
[0353]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect contains the first additive<br>
element and the second additive element together, the first additive element is one or<br>
more rare earth elements selected from the group consisting of Pr, Nd, Pm, and Sm, and<br>
the second additive element is one or more elements selected from B, Al, Ga, and Sc.<br>
Of the second additive elements, B, Al, and Ga have an ion radius smaller than the first<br>
additive element (rare earth element), so crystals distorted by the addition of the first<br>
additive element having an ion radius larger than Zn are recovered and aligned by adding<br>
the second additive element, such as B, Al, or Ga, or the crystal structure distorted by the<br>
addition of the first additive element is recovered and aligned by adding Sc having high<br>
reactivity as the second additive element. For this reason, a ZnO film having high<br>
permeability, excellent denseness, high conductivity, and excellent durability can be<br>
formed.<br>
[0354]<br>
As the ratio of the first additive element and the second additive element in the<br>
porous ZnO sintered body increases within a predetermined range, the conductivity of the<br>
ZnO film becomes better, and if the ratio is outside the range, the conductivity adversely<br>
deteriorates. Specifically, the content of the first additive element in the ZnO vapor<br>
deposition material is appropriately in a range of 0.1 to 14.9% by mass, and preferably, in<br>
a range of 3 to 6% by mass. If the content of the first additive element is lower than the<br>
lower limit value, 0.1% by mass, the conductivity is significantly lowered. If the<br>
content of the first additive element exceeds the upper limit value, 14.9% by mass, the<br>
permeability is significantly lowered.<br>
[0355]<br>
The content of the second additive element in the ZnO vapor deposition material<br>
is appropriately in a range of 0.1 to 10% by mass, and preferably, in a range of 1 to 3%<br>
by mass. If the content of the second additive element is lower than the lower limit<br>
value, 0.1% by mass, the conductivity is significantly lowered. If the content of the<br>
second additive element exceeds the upper limit value, 10% by mass, compositional shift<br>
at the time of deposition occurs.<br>
[0356]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect contains a larger amount of the<br>
first additive element than the second additive element, such that a dense crystal structure<br>
is maintained. If the content of the first additive element is lower than that of the<br>
second additive element, the conductivity and permeability are lowered. The total<br>
content of the first additive element and the second additive element is preferably in a<br>
range of 0.2 to 15% by mass. If the total content of the first additive element and the<br>
second additive element exceeds this range, the specific resistance and permeability of<br>
the ZnO vapor deposition material are significantly lowered.<br>
[0357]<br>
When a very small amount of the first additive element and the second additive<br>
element is contained in the ZnO vapor deposition material, the first additive element and<br>
the second additive element do not exist as granular precipitates in grain boundaries or<br>
grains in the ZnO matrix but are uniformly dispersed in the ZnO vapor deposition<br>
material. It is considered that, in the ZnO vapor deposition material, the first additive<br>
element and the second additive element are present as oxides.<br>
[0358]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect contains the first additive<br>
element, which is a trivalent or quadrivalent rare earth element, and the first additive<br>
element causes excess carrier electrons to be generated with respect to divalent Zn, such<br>
that high conductivity can be ensured. When a rare earth element is added to the ZnO<br>
vapor deposition material, compositional shift at the time of deposition is unlikely to<br>
occur, and a desired composition ratio can be maintained when a film is formed.<br>
[0359]<br>
According to the ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect, the conductivity is<br>
obtained by oxygen defect as well as compulsive injection of carrier electrons. Usually,<br>
oxygen gas is introduced in a vapor deposition method, but generally oxygen in the film<br>
composition is insufficient. At the time of transparent conductive film formation, a<br>
technique is conventionally used in which resistance is lowered by generating oxygen<br>
defect. However, in the case of adding a rare earth element, it is easy to control because<br>
the element is excellent in evaporation performance. In addition to this advantage by<br>
the addition of the first additive element which is a rare earth element, since the ZnO<br>
vapor deposition material of this aspect contains the second additive element, high<br>
conductivity like ITO can be obtained.<br>
[0360]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect is composed of a porous ZnO<br>
sintered body having a porosity of 3 to 50%. The porosity of the sintered body is<br>
appropriately in a range of 3 to 50%, preferably in a range of 5 to 30%, more preferably<br>
in a range of 10 to 30%, and still more preferably in a range of 20 to 30%. If the<br>
porosity is smaller than 3%, it is not preferable since, at the time of film formation by an<br>
electron beam deposition method or an ion plating method, the evaporation speed of the<br>
vapor deposition material does not increase, and as a result, the speed of film formation<br>
decreases, which results in an increase in production costs. If the porosity exceeds 50%,<br>
the strength of the porous sintered body is lowered, and it is difficult to obtain sufficient<br>
mechanical strength. If the porosity is equal to or greater than 10%, the evaporation<br>
speed can be improved. Further, if the porosity is equal to or greater than 20%, a vapor<br>
deposition material having an evaporation speed about two times higher than the<br>
conventional ZnO vapor deposition material can be obtained.<br>
[0361]<br>
In the porous ZnO sintered body of this aspect, the pores preferably have an<br>
average pore diameter of 0.1 to 500 µm. If the average pore diameter of the pores is<br>
within the above-described range, the evaporation speed can be further increased. If the<br>
pore diameter is smaller than 0.1 µm, there is no merit in the pores. If the pore diameter<br>
exceeds 500 µm, it is not preferable because the strength of the sintered body is lowered,<br>
which causes damages due to EB (electron beam) irradiation, that is, splash.<br>
[0362]<br>
The term "pore diameter" (the inner diameter of the pore) refers to, for example,<br>
the maximum value of the internal dimensions in the pores when the sectional portion of<br>
the vapor deposition material is observed by observation means, such as SEM or the like.<br>
As the evaluation method of the pores, measurement of porosity by a substitution method,<br>
measurement of porosity by microscopy, measurement of surface area and micropore<br>
distribution by gas absorption, measurement of surface area and micropore distribution<br>
by a mercury intrusion method, measurement of surface area by a gas permeation method,<br>
or measurement of micropore distribution by an X-ray small-angle scattering method<br>
may be used.<br>
[0363]<br>
The pores are preferably rounded, and in terms of improvement in the<br>
evaporation speed, micropores are preferably formed at the surface of the pores. For the<br>
evaluation method of the pores, the surface area is preferably in a range of 5 to 40 m2/g,<br>
and at least one peak of the micropore distribution is present within a range of 1 to 100 µm. Portions (frame portion) other than the pores are preferably substantially sintered.<br>
For example, the frame portion of the porous sintered body preferably has a density equal<br>
to or greater than 98%.<br>
[0364]<br>
In the porous ZnO sintered body of this aspect, it is preferable that grains<br>
preferably have an average crystal grain size of 1 to 500 µm, and rounded pores of about<br>
0.1 to 500 µm are provided in the sintered body. The porous ZnO sintered body has a<br>
fine crystal structure in which the average crystal grain size is within the above-described<br>
range, and the occurrence of defects in the boundary of crystal grains can be reduced.<br>
Thus, the formed ZnO film has excellent film characteristics, such as ZnO film density,<br>
thickness distribution, refractive index, sputtering resistance, discharge characteristics<br>
(discharge voltage, discharge responsiveness, and the like), insulation characteristics, and<br>
the like. If the average crystal grain size is smaller than 1 µm, the speed of film<br>
formation is lowered. If the average crystal grain size exceeds 500 µm, the deposition<br>
rate of the additive element is not uniform. The average crystal grain size is preferably<br>
in a range of 5 to 40 µm, and more preferably, in a range of 10 to 30 µm.<br>
[0365]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect is preferably molded in the<br>
form of disc-like or circular pellets. When the vapor deposition material has a circular<br>
shape, the diameter of the vapor deposition material is appropriately in a range of 5 to 30<br>
mm, and preferably, in a range of 5 to 15 mm. This is because, if the diameter is<br>
excessively small and smaller than 5 mm, splash occurs, and if the diameter exceeds 30<br>
mm, it is difficult to handle the vapor deposition material in an actual production process.<br>
When the vapor deposition material is disc-like, the diameter of the vapor deposition<br>
material is appropriately in a range of 5 to 20 mm, and preferably, in a range of 5 to 10<br>
mm. The height of the vapor deposition material is in a range of 1 to 10 mm, and<br>
preferably, in a range of 2 to 5 mm. This is because, if the diameter is excessively small<br>
and smaller than 5 mm or the height is excessively small and smaller than 1 mm, splash<br>
occurs, and if the diameter exceeds 30 mm or the height exceeds 10 mm, it is difficult to<br>
handle the vapor deposition material in an actual production process.<br>
[0366]<br>
Hereinafter, a process for producing a ZnO vapor deposition material according<br>
to this aspect will be described.<br>
[Production Process]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material according to this aspect can be produced by<br>
mixing ZnO powder having a purity equal to or greater than 98%, an oxide powder of a<br>
first additive element in such an amount that the content of the first additive element in<br>
the ZnO vapor deposition material is in a range of 0.1 to 14.9% by mass, an oxide<br>
powder of a second additive element in such an amount that the content of the second<br>
additive element in the ZnO vapor deposition material is in a range of 0.1 to 10% by<br>
mass, a binder, and an organic solvent to prepare a slurry with a concentration of 30 to<br>
75% by mass, blowing gas into the slurry to obtain a gas-containing slurry, spray-drying<br>
the gas-containing slurry to obtain a porous granulation powder having an average grain<br>
size of 50 to 300 µm, molding the porous granulation powder to obtain a porous molded<br>
body, and sintering the porous molded body at a predetermined temperature to obtain a<br>
porous ZnO sintered body.<br>
[0367]<br>
The ZnO powder preferably has purity equal to or greater than 98%, more<br>
preferably, equal to or greater than 98.4%, and still more preferably, equal to or greater<br>
than 99%. If the ZnO powder has purity equal to or greater than 98%, reduction of<br>
conductivity by the effect of impurities can be suppressed. The average grain size of<br>
the ZnO powder is in a range of 0.1 to 10 µm. When the average grain size of the ZnO<br>
powder is smaller than 0.1 µm, the powder is excessively fine and aggregated, so there is<br>
a tendency that the handling of the powder becomes worse, and it is difficult to prepare a<br>
high-concentration slurry. When the average grain size exceeds 10 µm, there is a<br>
tendency that it is difficult to control the micro-structure, and a dense pellet is hard to<br>
obtain. If the average grain size of the ZnO powder is adjusted to the above-described<br>
range, a desired sintered body is also obtained without using a sintering auxiliary agent.<br>
[0368]<br>
With regard to the oxide powder of the first additive element, considering the<br>
prevention of maldistribution of powder of the first additive element, reactivity with a<br>
ZnO matrix, and the purity of a compound of the first additive element, it is preferable to<br>
add oxide grains whose primary grain size is of a nanometer scale. The oxide powder<br>
of the second additive element preferably has an average grain size of 0.01 to 1 µm, and<br>
still more preferably, the average grain size is in a range of 0.05 to 0.5 µm. If the oxide<br>
powder of the second additive element having this average grain size is used, it is<br>
beneficial in terms of the uniform dispersion of the oxide powder of the second additive<br>
element.<br>
[0369]<br>
For a binder, polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl butyral, or the like may be used. It<br>
is preferable to add the binder at 0.2 to 2.5% by mass. For an organic solvent, ethanol,<br>
propanol, or the like may be used.<br>
[0370]<br>
The raw powder, the binder, and the organic solvent are mixed to prepare a slurry<br>
with a concentration of 30 to 75% by mass, and preferably, 40 to 65% by mass. If the<br>
slurry concentration exceeds 75% by mass, since the slurry is a non-aqueous system,<br>
stable granulation is difficult. If the slurry concentration is less than 30% by mass, it is<br>
difficult to obtain a dense ZnO sintered body having a uniform composition. If the<br>
slurry concentration is adjusted within the above-described range, the viscosity of the<br>
slurry is in a range of 200 to 1000 cps. Therefore, powder granulation using a spray<br>
drier can be performed stably. Further, the density of a molded body increases, such<br>
that a dense sintered body can be obtained.<br>
[0371]<br>
Wet blending of raw powder, a binder, and an organic solvent, and in particular,<br>
wet blending of raw powder and an organic solvent as a dispersion medium is preferably<br>
performed by a wet ball mill or a stirring mill. In the case of using a ZrO2 ball in the<br>
wet ball mill, wet blending is preferably performed using a large number of ZrO2 balls<br>
having a diameter of 5 to 10 mm for 8 to 24 hours, and preferably, for 20 to 24 hours. If<br>
the diameter of the ZrO2 ball is smaller than 5 mm, blending may be insufficient. If the<br>
diameter of the ZrO2 ball exceeds 10 mm, impurities are increased. Even though the<br>
blending time is long, up to 24 hours, impurities are hardly generated due to milling.<br>
On the other hand, when a resin ball with a metal support is used in the wet ball mill, a<br>
ball having a diameter of 10 to 15 mm is preferably used.<br>
[0372]<br>
In the stirring mill, wet blending is preferably performed using a ZrO2 ball having<br>
a diameter of 1 to 3 mm for 0.5 to 1 hour. If the diameter of the ZrO2 ball is smaller<br>
than 1 mm, blending is insufficient. If the diameter exceeds 3 mm, impurities are<br>
increased. If the blending time exceeds 1 hour, while raw materials are mixed, milling<br>
leads to the generation of impurities. Sufficient blending can be done within 1 hour.<br>
Blending/granulation of powder and additives may be performed by a general tumbling<br>
granulation method. In this case, it is not necessary to perform a separation operation<br>
from the balls or the like after the process, and thus the process is simplified.<br>
[0373]<br>
In the production process of this aspect, as a first step for obtaining a porous<br>
sintered body, gas is blown and mixed into the slurry to prepare a gas-containing slurry.<br>
Gas blowing and mixing is preferably performed by blowing using a mechanical pump,<br>
gas pressure, or the like. As the gas, air, an insoluble gas, a non-aqueous gas, or the like<br>
may be used.<br>
[0374]<br>
The gas-containing slurry is spray-dried. The spray drying is preferably<br>
performed at 150 to 250°C for 3 hours by using a spray drier. Since gas is blown into<br>
the slurry, the granulation powder obtained by spray-drying the slurry is porous.<br>
Through the spray drying, a porous granulation powder having an average grain size of<br>
50 to 300 µm can be obtained.<br>
[0375]<br>
In the production process of this aspect, as a second step for obtaining a porous<br>
sintered body, a slurry is prepared in which a foaming agent is mixed. For the foaming<br>
agent, an organic foaming agent or an inorganic foaming agent may be used. For the<br>
organic foaming agent, azodicarboxylamide, dinitrosobenta methylene tetramine, or the<br>
like is used, and for the inorganic foaming agent, carbonate or the like is used. The<br>
foaming agent may be mixed with ZnO powder, oxide powder of the first additive<br>
element, and Al2O3 powder, or may be added upon slurry preparation.<br>
[0376]<br>
The foaming agent-containing slurry is spray-dried. The spray drying is<br>
preferably performed at 150 to 250°C for 3 hours by using a spray drier. The foaming<br>
agent contained in the slurry is foamed and dissolved upon this spray drying, such that<br>
resultant granulation powder is made porous. Through the spray drying, a porous<br>
granulation powder having an average grain size of 50 to 300 µm can be obtained.<br>
[0377]<br>
In the production process of this aspect, as a third step for obtaining a porous<br>
sintered body, a slurry is prepared in which an additive, which will be volatized and<br>
dissolved upon sintering, is mixed. Examples of the additive include butyral capable of<br>
being dissolved in a solvent, and a cellulose-based additive, a polyvinyl-based additive, a<br>
polyester-based additive, a polyethylene-based additive, and the like capable of being<br>
dissolved in an alcohol-based solvent. Examples of the additive which will not be<br>
dissolved in the alcohol-based solvent include a starch-based additive and a<br>
polystyrene-based additive having an average grain size of about several µm to 500 µm.<br>
It is preferable that butyral is mixed in the slurry at about 20% by mass, or starch is<br>
mixed in the slurry at about 20% by mass.<br>
[0378]<br>
If the slurry contains the additive, the additive is volatized and dissolved upon<br>
sintering to form pores, thereby obtaining a porous sintered body. The diameter and<br>
shape of the pores can be controlled by adjusting the kind and amount of the additive.<br>
For example, when a butyral-based additive is used, pores having a pore diameter of 0.1 µm to 10 µm order can be formed. When starch is used, pores having the same pore<br>
diameter as the grain size of starch and the same shape as starch can be formed. Thus,<br>
when starch is used, the pore diameter and shape of the pores can be more easily<br>
controlled.<br>
[0379]<br>
Specifically, in the case of the ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect, a<br>
vapor deposition material using a butyral-based additive can obtain a deposition speed<br>
about 1.3 times higher than the evaporation speed of the conventional ZnO vapor<br>
deposition material having relative density equal to or greater than about 98%, and a<br>
vapor deposition material using starch having an average grain size of 0.1 to 500 µm can<br>
obtain an evaporation speed about 2.5 times higher than the evaporation speed of the<br>
conventional ZnO vapor deposition material having relative density equal to or greater<br>
than about 98%. Therefore, a high speed of film formation can be obtained.<br>
[0380]<br>
In the production process of this aspect, as a fourth step for obtaining a porous<br>
sintered body, a slurry using ZnO powder having a grain size distribution within a<br>
predetermined range is prepared. Specifically, ZnO powder having an average grain<br>
size of 10 to 500 µm and a grain size distribution within a range of ±10% of the average<br>
grain size is used. If the grain size distribution of ZnO powder is outside the range of<br>
±10% of the average grain size, the porosity is lowered. More preferably, the grain size<br>
distribution is within a range of ±5% of the average grain size. The preferred grain size<br>
of oxide powder of the first additive element and Al2O3 powder is significantly smaller<br>
than that of ZnO powder, and the usage is smaller than that of ZnO powder, so oxide<br>
powder of the first additive element and Al2O3 powder may be outside the limitation of<br>
the grain size distribution.<br>
[0381]<br>
The slurry using ZnO powder with a controlled grain size distribution is<br>
spray-dried. The spray drying is preferably performed at 150 to 250°C for 3 hours by<br>
using a spray drier. In the slurry to be spray-dried, ZnO powder having an average<br>
grain size of 10 to 500 µm and a grain size distribution within a range of ±10% of the<br>
average grain size is used, and no fine ZnO powder is substantially contained. Thus,<br>
there are no cases where fine ZnO grains fill the gaps between ZnO grains, so the gaps<br>
between ZnO grains remain as pores, and granulation powder becomes porous.<br>
Through the spray drying, a porous granulation powder having an average grain size of<br>
50 to 300 µm can be obtained.<br>
[0382]<br>
After the slurry is spray-dried to obtain a granulation powder having an average<br>
grain size of 50 to 300 µm, the granulation powder is molded under a predetermined<br>
pressure. If the average grain size of the granulation powder is smaller than 50 µm,<br>
moldability deteriorates, and if the average grain size is larger than 300 µm, the density<br>
of the molded body is lowered, and the strength is likely to be insufficient.<br>
[0383]<br>
For a pressing molding device, a uniaxial press device, a cold isostatic press<br>
(CIP) molding device, or other devices may be used. The molding pressure is<br>
appropriately in a range of 100 to 2000 kgf/cm2 (9.8 to 196 MPa), and preferably, 100 to<br>
1000 kgf/cm2 (9.8 to 98 MPa). Molding is performed under pressure within the<br>
above-described range, such that the density of the molded body can be increased,<br>
deformation after sintering can be suppressed, and postprocessing is not required.<br>
[0384]<br>
Next, the molded body is sintered. Before sintering, the molded body is<br>
preferably degreased at a temperature of 350 to 620°C. Through this degreasing, spots<br>
on the molded body after sintering can be suppressed. The degreasing is preferably<br>
performed for a sufficient time.<br>
[0385]<br>
Sintering is performed in an atmosphere of air, an inactive gas, a vacuum, or a<br>
reductive gas at a temperature equal to or higher than 1000°C, and preferably, at a<br>
temperature of 1200 to 1400°C for 1 to 10 hours, and preferably, for 2 to 5 hours. The<br>
sintering is performed under air pressure, but in the case of pressure sintering, such as hot<br>
press (HP) sintering or hot isostatic press (HIP) sintering, the sintering is preferably<br>
performed in an atmosphere of inactive gas, vacuum, or reductive gas at a temperature<br>
equal to or higher than 1000°C for 1 to 5 hours.<br>
[0386]<br>
A ZnO film is formed on the surface of the substrate by a vacuum film formation<br>
method with a ZnO vapor deposition material composed of the resultant porous sintered<br>
body as a target material. As the vacuum film formation method suitable for forming a<br>
film using the ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect, an electron beam deposition<br>
method, an ion plating method, a sputtering method, or a plasma deposition method may<br>
be used. A ZnO film of this aspect formed by the film formation method uses the ZnO<br>
vapor deposition material of this aspect, so the ZnO film has high conductivity with<br>
specific resistance of 3 to 5X10-4 O cm and high permeability with visible light<br>
permeability equal to or greater than 90%, like ITO.<br>
[0387]<br>
In the ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect, the crystal structure distorted<br>
by the addition of the first additive element (rare earth element) having an ion radius<br>
larger than Zn is recovered and aligned by addition of the second additive element having<br>
a small ion radius, such as B, Al, or Ga, or Sc having high reactivity is added to recover a<br>
film having a regulated crystal structure. Therefore, a dense film can be formed, and<br>
the durability of the film can also be improved.<br>
[0388]<br>
According to the production process of this aspect, in any of the first step of<br>
mixing gas in the slurry, the second step of preparing the foaming agent-containing slurry,<br>
the third step of preparing the slurry containing the additive which will be volatized and<br>
dissolved upon sintering, and the fourth step of preparing the slurry using ZnO powder<br>
having a grain size distribution within a predetermined range, the porosity, pore diameter,<br>
and pore shape can be easily controlled. Therefore, a vapor deposition material having<br>
optimum pores can be produced. As a result, even when a large number of pore states<br>
are required by the production conditions or the like, an optimum vapor deposition<br>
material can be provided to cope with the requirements.<br>
[0389]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect is composed mainly of a porous<br>
sintered body having a porosity of 5 to 30% and a pore diameter of 0.1 to 500 µm, so<br>
when a ZnO transparent conductive film is formed by an electron beam deposition<br>
method or an ion plating method using the ZnO vapor deposition material, the<br>
evaporation speed can be improved. That is, when film formation is performed with the<br>
same electron beam energy, the speed of film formation increases, and the operation time<br>
is shortened, thereby increasing the number of products for a predetermined time.<br>
Further, when film formation is performed at the same film formation speed, electron<br>
beam energy is reduced, and the replacement timing of a filament of an electron gun or<br>
the like is delayed, such that the number of times of maintenance is reduced and<br>
productivity is improved. As a result, production costs can be reduced.<br>
[0390]<br>
Next, another aspect of the present invention will be described.<br>
[ZnO vapor deposition material]<br>
A ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect is a ZnO vapor deposition<br>
material for formation of a transparent conductive film which is composed of a ZnO<br>
sintered body having a ZnO purity equal to or greater than 98%, wherein the sintered<br>
body contains one or more additive elements selected from the group consisting of Y, La,<br>
Sc, Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm, and Sm, and the sintered body is a porous sintered body having a<br>
porosity of 3 to 50%.<br>
[0391]<br>
The inventors have investigated in detail the effect on conductivity due to<br>
additive species and the content in a ZnO vapor deposition material and a ZnO film<br>
formed by using the vapor deposition material, and have found that there is a significant<br>
level of influence on conductivity due to the species and content of one or more additive<br>
elements selected from the group consisting of Y, La, Sc, Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm, and Sm in the<br>
porous ZnO sintered body. Based on the above-described knowledge, the ZnO vapor<br>
deposition material according to this aspect contains ZnO as a major component, and also<br>
contains the additive elements, such that excess electrons contributing to conduction are<br>
developed in large amounts and maintained, thereby forming a ZnO film having high<br>
conductivity.<br>
[0392]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect is composed of a ZnO sintered<br>
body having a ZnO purity equal to or greater than 98%, preferably equal to or greater<br>
than 98.4%, and more preferably equal to or greater than 99 %. If the ZnO purity is<br>
smaller than 98%, the conductivity is lowered by the effect of impurities. The ZnO<br>
sintered body may be monocrystal or polycrystal.<br>
[0393]<br>
The ZnO sintered body contains one or more additive elements selected from the<br>
group consisting of Y, La, Sc, Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm, and Sm. The additive element includes a<br>
misch metal (also indicated by Mm) which is a mixture with La, Ce, or Nd as a major<br>
component.<br>
[0394]<br>
As the concentration of the additive elements in the porous ZnO sintered body<br>
increases, the conductivity of the ZnO film becomes better, and if the concentration<br>
further increases, the conductivity adversely deteriorates. Thus, there is an optimum<br>
concentration range for obtaining a ZnO film having high conductivity. Specifically,<br>
the content of the additive elements is appropriately in a range of 2 to 20% by mass, and<br>
preferably, in a range of 3 to 6% by mass. If the content of the additive elements is<br>
lower than 2% by mass, the conductivity is not improved. If the content of the additive<br>
elements exceeds 20% by mass, the conductivity is lowered and the permeability is<br>
deteriorated.<br>
[0395]<br>
Since a very small amount of the additive elements is contained, the additive<br>
elements do not exist as granular precipitates in grain boundaries or grains in the ZnO<br>
matrix but are uniformly dispersed in the ZnO sintered body. The additive elements<br>
exist in the ZnO vapor deposition material as oxide. For example, Y is present as Y2O3,<br>
and La is present as La2O3. Sc is present as SC2O3, and Ce is present as CeO2 or Ce2O3.<br>
Pr is present as Pr6O11, and Nd is present as Nd2O3. Pm is present as Pm2O3, and Sm is<br>
present as Sm2O3.<br>
[0396]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect contains a tri- or quadri- or<br>
more valent rare earth element, and the rare earth element can cause excess carrier<br>
electrons to be generated with respect to divalent Zn. When a rare earth element is<br>
added to the ZnO vapor deposition material, compositional shift at the time of deposition<br>
is unlikely to occur, and a desired composition ratio can be maintained when a film is<br>
formed.<br>
[0397]<br>
In general, as a mechanism for obtaining the conductivity, oxygen defect is used,<br>
as well as compulsive injection of carrier electrons. Usually, oxygen gas is introduced<br>
in a vapor deposition method, but generally oxygen in the film composition is<br>
insufficient. At the time of transparent conductive film formation, a technique is<br>
conventionally used in which resistance is lowered by generating oxygen defect.<br>
However, in the case of adding a rare earth element, it is easy to control because the<br>
element is excellent in evaporation performance. With this advantage, the present<br>
invention uses an additive element other than Al or Ga, thereby obtaining conductivity<br>
like ITO.<br>
[0398]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect is composed of a porous ZnO<br>
sintered body having a porosity of 3 to 50%. The porosity of the sintered body is<br>
appropriately in a range of 3 to 50%, preferably in a range of 5 to 30%, more preferably<br>
in a range of 10 to 30%, and still more preferably in a range of 20 to 30%. If the<br>
porosity is smaller than 3%, it is not preferable since, at the time of film formation by an<br>
electron beam deposition method or an ion plating method, the evaporation speed of the<br>
vapor deposition material does not increase, and as a result, the speed of film formation<br>
decreases, which results in an increase in production costs. If the porosity exceeds 50%,<br>
the strength of the porous sintered body is lowered, and it is difficult to obtain sufficient<br>
mechanical strength. If the porosity is equal to or greater than 10%, the evaporation<br>
speed can be improved. Further, if the porosity is equal to or greater than 20%, a vapor<br>
deposition material having an evaporation speed about two times higher than the<br>
conventional ZnO vapor deposition material can be obtained.<br>
[0399]<br>
In the porous ZnO sintered body of this aspect, the pores preferably have an<br>
average pore diameter of 0.1 to 500 µm. If the average pore diameter of the pores is<br>
within the above-described range, the evaporation speed can be further increased. If the<br>
pore diameter is smaller than 0.1 µm, there is no merit in the pores. If the pore diameter<br>
exceeds 500 µm, it is not preferable because the strength of the sintered body is lowered,<br>
which causes damages due to EB (electron beam) irradiation, that is, splash.<br>
[0400]<br>
The term "pore diameter" (the inner diameter of the pore) refers to, for example,<br>
the maximum value of the internal dimensions in the pores when the sectional portion of<br>
the vapor deposition material is observed by observation means, such as SEM or the like.<br>
As the evaluation method of the pores, measurement of porosity by a substitution method,<br>
measurement of porosity by microscopy, measurement of surface area and micropore<br>
distribution by gas absorption, measurement of surface area and micropore distribution<br>
by a mercury intrusion method, measurement of surface area by a gas permeation method,<br>
or measurement of micropore distribution by an X-ray small-angle scattering method<br>
may be used.<br>
[0401]<br>
The pores are preferably rounded, and in terms of improvement in the<br>
evaporation speed, micropores are preferably formed at the surface of the pores. For the<br>
evaluation method of the pores, the surface area is preferably in a range of 5 to 40 m2/g,<br>
and at least one peak of the micropore distribution is present within a range of 1 to 100 µm. Portions (frame portion) other than the pores are preferably substantially sintered.<br>
For example, the frame portion of the porous sintered body preferably has a density equal<br>
to or greater than 98%.<br>
[0402]<br>
In the porous ZnO sintered body of this aspect, it is preferable that grains<br>
preferably have an average crystal grain size of 1 to 500 µm, and rounded pores of about<br>
0.1 to 500 µm are provided in the sintered body. The porous ZnO sintered body has a<br>
fine crystal structure in which the average crystal grain size is within the above-described<br>
range, and the occurrence of defects in the boundary of crystal grains can be reduced.<br>
Thus, the formed ZnO film has excellent film characteristics, such as ZnO film density,<br>
thickness distribution, refractive index, sputtering resistance, discharge characteristics<br>
(discharge voltage, discharge responsiveness, and the like), insulation characteristics, and<br>
the like. If the average crystal grain size is smaller than 1 |am, the speed of film<br>
formation is lowered. If the average crystal grain size exceeds 500 u.m, the deposition<br>
rate of the additive element is not uniform. The average crystal grain size is preferably<br>
in a range of 5 to 40 µm, and more preferably, in a range of 10 to 30 µm.<br>
[0403]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect is preferably molded in the<br>
form of disc-like or circular pellets. When the vapor deposition material has a circular<br>
shape, the diameter of the vapor deposition material is appropriately in a range of 5 to 30<br>
mm, and preferably, in a range of 5 to 15 mm. This is because, if the diameter is<br>
excessively small and smaller than 5 mm, splash occurs, and if the diameter exceeds 30<br>
mm, it is difficult to handle the vapor deposition material in an actual production process.<br>
When the vapor deposition material is disk-like, the diameter of the vapor deposition<br>
material is appropriately in a range of 5 to 50 mm, and preferably, in a range of 5 to 10<br>
mm. The height of the vapor deposition material is in a range of 1 to 30 mm, and<br>
preferably, in a range of 2 to 5 mm. This is because, if the diameter is excessively small<br>
and smaller than 5 mm or the height is excessively small and smaller than 1 mm, splash<br>
occurs, and if the diameter exceeds 50 mm or the height exceeds 30 mm, upon deposition,<br>
a uniform film is not formed and the film formation speed is lowered due to the decrease<br>
in the filling ratio to a hearth (vapor deposition material crucible).<br>
[0404]<br>
Hereinafter, a process for producing a ZnO vapor deposition material according<br>
to this aspect will be described.<br>
[Production Process]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material according to this aspect can be produced by<br>
mixing ZnO powder having a purity equal to or greater than 98%, an oxide powder of<br>
additive elements, a binder, and an organic solvent to prepare a slurry with a<br>
concentration of 30 to 75% by mass, blowing gas into the slurry to obtain a<br>
gas-containing slurry, spray-drying the gas-containing slurry to obtain a porous<br>
granulation powder having an average grain size of 50 to 300 µm, molding the porous<br>
granulation powder to obtain a porous molded body, and sintering the porous molded<br>
body at a predetermined temperature to obtain a porous ZnO sintered body.<br>
[0405]<br>
The ZnO powder preferably has purity equal to or greater than 98%, more<br>
preferably, equal to or greater than 98.4%, and still more preferably, equal to or greater<br>
than 99%. If the ZnO powder has purity equal to or greater than 98%, reduction of<br>
conductivity by the effect of impurities can be suppressed. The average grain size of<br>
the ZnO powder is in a range of 0.1 to 10 µm. When the average grain size of the ZnO<br>
powder is smaller than 0.1 µm, the powder is excessively fine and aggregated, so there is<br>
a tendency that the handling of the powder becomes worse, and it is difficult to prepare a<br>
high-concentration slurry. When the average grain size exceeds 10 µm, there is a<br>
tendency that it is difficult to control the micro-structure, and a dense pellet is hard to<br>
obtain. If the average grain size of the ZnO powder is adjusted to the above-described<br>
range, a desired sintered body is also obtained without using a sintering auxiliary agent.<br>
[0406]<br>
With regard to the oxide powder of the additive element, considering the<br>
prevention of maldistribution of the powder, reactivity with a ZnO matrix, and the purity<br>
of a compound of the additive element, it is preferable to add oxide grains whose primary<br>
grain size is of a nanometer scale. The oxide powder of the additive element preferably<br>
has an average grain size of 0.01 to 1 µm, and still more preferably, the average grain<br>
size is in a range of 0.05 to 0.5 µm. If the oxide powder of the additive element having<br>
this average grain size is used, it is beneficial in terms of the uniform dispersion of the<br>
oxide powder of the additive element.<br>
[0407]<br>
Oxide powder is used in such an amount that the content of the additive elements<br>
in the ZnO sintered body is in a range of 2 to 20% by mass, and preferably, in a range of<br>
3 to 6% by mass, and oxide powder of the additive elements are mixed in ZnO powder to<br>
prepare raw powder.<br>
[0408]<br>
For a binder, polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl butyral, or the like may be used. It<br>
is preferable to add the binder at 0.2 to 2.5% by mass. For an organic solvent, ethanol,<br>
propanol, or the like may be used.<br>
[0409]<br>
The raw powder, the binder, and the organic solvent are mixed to prepare a slurry<br>
with a concentration of 30 to 75% by mass, and preferably, 40 to 65% by mass. If the<br>
slurry concentration exceeds 75% by mass, since the slurry is a non-aqueous system,<br>
stable granulation is difficult. If the slurry concentration is less than 30% by mass, it is<br>
difficult to obtain a dense ZnO sintered body having a uniform composition. If the<br>
slurry concentration is adjusted within the above-described range, the viscosity of the<br>
slurry is in a range of 200 to 1000 cps. Therefore, powder granulation using a spray<br>
drier can be performed stably. Further, the density of a molded body increases, such<br>
that a dense sintered body can be obtained.<br>
[0410]<br>
Wet blending of raw powder, a binder, and an organic solvent, and in particular,<br>
wet blending of raw powder and an organic solvent as a dispersion medium is preferably<br>
performed by a wet ball mill or a stirring mill. In the case of using a ZrO2 ball in the<br>
wet ball mill, wet blending is preferably performed using a large number of ZrO2 balls<br>
having a diameter of 5 to 10 mm for 8 to 24 hours, and preferably, for 20 to 24 hours. If<br>
the diameter of the ZrO2 ball is smaller than 5 mm, blending may be insufficient. If the<br>
diameter of the ZrO2 ball exceeds 10 mm, impurities are increased. Even though the<br>
blending time is long, up to 24 hours, impurities are hardly generated due to milling.<br>
On the other hand, when a resin ball with a metal support is used in the wet ball mill, a<br>
ball having a diameter of 10 to 15 mm is preferably used.<br>
[0411]<br>
In the stirring mill, wet blending is preferably performed using a ZrO2 ball having<br>
a diameter of 1 to 3 mm for 0.5 to 1 hour. If the diameter of the ZrO2 ball is smaller<br>
than 1 mm, blending is insufficient. If the diameter exceeds 3 mm, impurities are<br>
increased. If the blending time exceeds 1 hour, while raw materials are mixed, milling<br>
leads to the generation of impurities. Sufficient blending can be done within 1 hour.<br>
Blending/granulation of powder and additives may be performed by a general tumbling<br>
granulation method. In this case, it is not necessary to perform a separation operation<br>
from the balls or the like after the process, and thus the process is simplified.<br>
[0412]<br>
In the production process of this aspect, as a first step for obtaining a porous<br>
sintered body, gas is blown and mixed into the slurry to prepare a gas-containing slurry.<br>
Gas blowing and mixing is preferably performed by blowing using a mechanical pump,<br>
gas pressure, or the like. As the gas, air, an insoluble gas, a non-aqueous gas, or the like<br>
may be used.<br>
[0413]<br>
The gas-containing slurry is spray-dried. The spray drying is preferably<br>
performed at 150 to 250°C for 3 hours by using a spray drier. Since gas is blown into<br>
the slurry, the granulation powder obtained by spray-drying the slurry is porous.<br>
Through the spray drying, a porous granulation powder having an average grain size of<br>
50 to 300 µm can be obtained.<br>
[0414]<br>
In the production process of this aspect, as a second step for obtaining a porous<br>
sintered body, a slurry is prepared in which a foaming agent is mixed. For the foaming<br>
agent, an organic foaming agent or an inorganic foaming agent may be used. For the<br>
organic foaming agent, azodicarboxylamide, dinitrosobenta methylene tetramine, or the<br>
like is used, and for the inorganic foaming agent, carbonate or the like is used. The<br>
foaming agent may be mixed with ZnO powder, oxide powder of the first additive<br>
element, and Al2O3 powder, or may be added upon slurry preparation.<br>
[0415]<br>
The foaming agent-containing slurry is spray-dried. The spray drying is<br>
preferably performed at 150 to 250°C for 3 hours by using a spray drier. The foaming<br>
agent contained in the slurry is foamed and dissolved upon this spray drying, such that<br>
resultant granulation powder is made porous. Through the spray drying, a porous<br>
granulation powder having an average grain size of 50 to 300 µm can be obtained.<br>
[0416]<br>
In the production process of this aspect, as a third step for obtaining a porous<br>
sintered body, a slurry is prepared in which an additive, which will be volatized and<br>
dissolved upon sintering, is mixed. Examples of the additive include butyral capable of<br>
being dissolved in a solvent, and a cellulose-based additive, a polyvinyl-based additive, a<br>
polyester-based additive, a polyethylene-based additive, and the like capable of being<br>
dissolved in an alcohol-based solvent. Examples of the additive which will not be<br>
dissolved in the alcohol-based solvent include a starch-based additive and a<br>
polystyrene-based additive having an average grain size of about several µm to 500 µm.<br>
It is preferable that butyral is mixed in the slurry at about 20% by mass, or starch is<br>
mixed in the slurry at about 20% by mass.<br>
[0417]<br>
If the slurry contains the additive, the additive is volatized and dissolved upon<br>
sintering to form pores, thereby obtaining a porous sintered body. The diameter and<br>
shape of the pores can be controlled by adjusting the kind and amount of the additive.<br>
For example, when a butyral-based additive is used, pores having a pore diameter of 0.1 µm to 10 µm order can be formed. When starch is used, pores having the same pore<br>
diameter as the grain size of starch and the same shape as starch can be formed. Thus,<br>
when starch is used, the pore diameter and shape of the pores can be more easily<br>
controlled.<br>
[0418]<br>
Specifically, in the case of the ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect, a<br>
vapor deposition material using a butyral-based additive can obtain a deposition speed<br>
about 1.3 times higher than the evaporation speed of the conventional ZnO vapor<br>
deposition material having relative density equal to or greater than about 98%, and a<br>
vapor deposition material using starch having an average grain size of 0.1 to 500 µm can<br>
obtain an evaporation speed about 2.5 times higher than the evaporation speed of the<br>
conventional ZnO vapor deposition material having relative density equal to or greater<br>
than about 98%. Therefore, a high speed of film formation can be obtained.<br>
[0419]<br>
In the production process of this aspect, as a fourth step for obtaining a porous<br>
sintered body, a slurry using ZnO powder having a grain size distribution within a<br>
predetermined range is prepared. Specifically, ZnO powder having an average grain<br>
size of 10 to 500 µm and a grain size distribution within a range of ±10% of the average<br>
grain size is used. If the grain size distribution of ZnO powder is outside the range of<br>
±10% of the average grain size, the porosity is lowered. More preferably, the grain size<br>
distribution is within a range of ±5% of the average grain size. The preferred grain size<br>
of oxide powder of the first additive element and Al2O3 powder is significantly smaller<br>
than that of ZnO powder, and the usage is smaller than that of ZnO powder, so oxide<br>
powder of the first additive element and Al2O3 powder may be outside the limitation of<br>
the grain size distribution.<br>
[0420]<br>
The slurry using ZnO powder with a controlled grain size distribution is<br>
spray-dried. The spray drying is preferably performed at 150 to 250°C for 3 hours by<br>
using a spray drier. In the slurry to be spray-dried, ZnO powder having an average<br>
grain size of 10 to 500 µm and a grain size distribution within a range of ±10% of the<br>
average grain size is used, and no fine ZnO powder is substantially contained. Thus,<br>
there are no cases where fine ZnO grains fill the gaps between ZnO grains, so the gaps<br>
between ZnO grains remain as pores, and granulation powder becomes porous.<br>
Through the spray drying, a porous granulation powder having an average grain size of<br>
50 to 300 µm can be obtained.<br>
[0421]<br>
After the slurry is spray-dried to obtain a granulation powder having an average<br>
grain size of 50 to 300 µm, the granulation powder is molded under a predetermined<br>
pressure. If the average grain size of the granulation powder is smaller than 50 µm,<br>
moldability deteriorates, and if the average grain size is larger than 300 µm, the density<br>
of the molded body is lowered, and the strength is likely to be insufficient.<br>
[0422]<br>
For a pressing molding device, a uniaxial press device, a cold isostatic press<br>
(CIP) molding device, or other devices may be used. The molding pressure is<br>
appropriately in a range of 100 to 2000 kgf/cm2 (9.8 to 196 MPa), and preferably, 100 to<br>
1000 kgf/cm2 (9.8 to 98 MPa). Molding is performed under pressure within the<br>
above-described range, such that the density of the molded body can be increased,<br>
deformation after sintering can be suppressed, and postprocessing is not required.<br>
[0423]<br>
Next, the molded body is sintered. Before sintering, the molded body is<br>
preferably degreased at a temperature of 350 to 620°C. Through this degreasing, spots<br>
on the molded body after sintering can be suppressed. The degreasing is preferably<br>
performed for a sufficient time.<br>
[0424]<br>
Sintering is performed in an atmosphere of air, an inactive gas, a vacuum, or a<br>
reductive gas at a temperature equal to or higher than 1000°C, and preferably, at a<br>
temperature of 1200 to 1400°C for 1 to 10 hours, and preferably, for 2 to 5 hours. The<br>
sintering is performed under air pressure, but in the case of pressure sintering, such as hot<br>
press (HP) sintering or hot isostatic press (HIP) sintering, the sintering is preferably<br>
performed in an atmosphere of inactive gas, vacuum, or reductive gas at a temperature<br>
equal to or higher than 1000°C for 1 to 5 hours.<br>
[0425]<br>
A ZnO film is formed on the surface of the substrate by a vacuum film formation<br>
method with a ZnO vapor deposition material composed of the resultant porous sintered<br>
body as a target material. As the vacuum film formation method suitable for forming a<br>
film using the ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect, an electron beam deposition<br>
method, an ion plating method, a sputtering method, or a plasma deposition method may<br>
be used. A ZnO film of this aspect formed by the film formation method uses the ZnO<br>
vapor deposition material containing the additive elements, so the ZnO film having high<br>
conductivity and visible light permeability is obtained.<br>
[0426]<br>
According to the production process of this aspect, in any of the first step of<br>
mixing gas in the slurry, the second step of preparing the foaming agent-containing slurry,<br>
the third step of preparing the slurry containing the additive which will be volatized and<br>
dissolved upon sintering, and the fourth step of preparing the slurry using ZnO powder<br>
having a grain size distribution within a predetermined range, the porosity, pore diameter,<br>
and pore shape can be easily controlled. Therefore, a vapor deposition material having<br>
optimum pores can be produced. As a result, even when a large number of pore states<br>
are required by the production conditions or the like, an optimum vapor deposition<br>
material can be provided to cope with the requirements.<br>
[0427]<br>
The ZnO vapor deposition material of this aspect is composed mainly of a porous<br>
sintered body having a porosity of 5 to 30% and a pore diameter of 0.1 to 500 µm, so<br>
when a ZnO transparent conductive film is formed by an electron beam deposition<br>
method or an ion plating method using the ZnO vapor deposition material, the<br>
evaporation speed can be improved. That is, when film formation is performed with the<br>
same electron beam energy, the speed of film formation increases, and the operation time<br>
is shortened, thereby increasing the number of products for a predetermined time.<br>
Further, when film formation is performed at the same film formation speed, electron<br>
beam energy is reduced, and the replacement timing of a filament of an electron gun or<br>
the like is delayed, such that the number of times of maintenance is reduced and<br>
productivity is improved. As a result, production costs can be reduced.<br>
[Examples]<br>
[0428]<br>
Hereinafter, Example A Group of the present invention will be described together<br>
with Comparative Example A Group. In Example A and Comparative Example A,<br>
commercially available ZnO powder (having a purity equal to or greater than 99% and an<br>
average grain size of 0.3 µm), CeO2 powder (having a purity equal to or greater than 99%<br>
and an average grain size of 0.3 µm), and Al2O3 powder (having a purity equal to or<br>
greater than 99% and an average grain size of 0.3 µm) were used. In any case, a slurry<br>
was prepared by using a ball mill (with a nylon-coated steel ball having a diameter of 5 to<br>
20 mm), and wet blending was performed for 24 hours. In any case, a uniaxial molding<br>
press device was used as the molding device, and molded bodies having an outer<br>
diameter of 6.7 mmF and a thickness of 2.0 mm were molded under pressure of 100<br>
kgf/cm (9.8 MPa). The molded bodies were put in an electric furnace and calcinated<br>
under air pressure at 1300°C for 3 hours, thereby obtaining sintered body pellets.<br>
[0429]<br>
In Example A and Comparative Example A, the porosity was measured by a<br>
substitution method. The measurement of the average pore diameter and the crystal<br>
grain size was performed by SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy). The evaporation<br>
speed was measured by a quartz crystal thickness monitor provided obliquely above the<br>
hearth. The specific resistance was measured by a four-terminal four-probe method<br>
with the application of a constant current at 25 °C in an atmosphere by using Loresta<br>
(trademark) from Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation (HP MCP-T410, probe in series, 1.5<br>
mm pitch) as the measuring instrument. The visible light permeability was measured by<br>
placing the substrate after film formation vertically to measurement light for a visible<br>
wavelength band (380 to 780 nm) by using a spectrophotometer U-4000 manufactured by<br>
Hitachi, Ltd. as the measuring instrument.<br>
[0430]<br>
[Example A1]<br>
1% by mass of polyvinyl butyral as a binder was added to 100 g of a raw powder<br>
containing 91 g of ZnO powder, 6.2 g of CeO2 powder, and 2.8 g of Al2O3 powder, and<br>
methylated alcohol as a dispersion medium was further added, thereby obtaining a slurry<br>
with a concentration of 30% by mass. Next, the slurry was put in a ball mill, air was<br>
blown into the slurry, and wet blending was performed, thereby obtaining a<br>
gas-containing slurry. The slurry was dry-comminuted after the dispersion medium in<br>
the slurry was vaporized by a vacuum drier at 80°C, thereby obtaining porous granulation<br>
powder having an average grain size of 200 µm. The granulation powder was molded<br>
under a predetermined pressure, and a molded body was calcinated, thereby producing<br>
porous sintered body pellets (ZnO vapor deposition material). The porosity, average<br>
pore diameter, and average crystal grain size of the sintered body are shown in Table 1.<br>
[0431]<br>
[Example A2]<br>
An organic foaming agent and an inorganic foaming agent were added to 100 g of<br>
the same raw powder as in Example Al, 1% by mass of polyvinyl butyral as a binder was<br>
added, and methylated alcohol was further added as a dispersion medium, thereby<br>
obtaining a slurry (viscosity 200 to 4000 cps) with a concentration of 30% by mass. For<br>
the organic foaming agent, azodicarboxylamide and dinitrosobenta methylene tetramine<br>
were used, and for the inorganic foaming agent, carbonate was used. The foaming<br>
agent-containing slurry was put in a ball mill, wet blending was performed, then, the<br>
slurry was dry-comminuted after the dispersion medium in the slurry was vaporized by a<br>
vacuum drier at 80°C, thereby obtaining porous granulation powder having an average<br>
grain size of 200 µm. The granulation powder was molded under a predetermined<br>
pressure and calcinated, thereby producing porous sintered body pellets (ZnO vapor<br>
deposition material). The porosity, average pore diameter, and average crystal grain<br>
size of the sintered body are shown in Table 1.<br>
[0432]<br>
[Example A3]<br>
An additive which will be volatized and dissolved upon calcination was added to<br>
100 g of the same raw powder as in Example Al, 1% by mass of polyvinyl butyral was<br>
added as a binder, and methylated alcohol was further added as a dispersion medium,<br>
thereby obtaining a slurry (viscosity 200 to 4000 cps) with a concentration of 30% by<br>
mass. For the additive which will be volatized and dissolved upon calcination, 20% by<br>
mass of polyvinyl butyral was used. The additive-containing slurry was put in a ball<br>
mill, wet blending was performed, then, the slurry was dry-comminuted after the<br>
dispersion medium in the slurry was vaporized by a vacuum drier at 80°C, thereby<br>
obtaining granulation powder having an average grain size of 200 µm. The granulation<br>
powder was molded under a predetermined pressure, and the molded bodies were<br>
calcinated such that the additive was volatized and dissolved, thereby producing porous<br>
sintered body pellets (ZnO vapor deposition material). The porosity, average pore<br>
diameter, and average crystal grain size of the sintered body are shown in Table 1.<br>
[0433]<br>
[Example A4]<br>
A porous sintered body pellet (ZnO vapor deposition material) was produced in<br>
the same manner as in Example A3 except that, for the additive which will be volatized<br>
and dissolved upon calcination, 20% by mass of starch having a grain size of 50 µm was<br>
used. The porosity, average pore diameter, and average crystal grain size of the sintered<br>
body are shown in Table 1.<br>
[0434]<br>
[Example A5]<br>
The same raw powder as in Example Al was used, and ZnO powder was filtered<br>
such that ZnO powder having an average grain size of 60 µm and a grain size distribution<br>
within a range of 55 to 65 µm was obtained. 1 % by mass of polyvinyl butyral as a<br>
binder and also 30% by mass of methylated alcohol as an organic solvent were added to<br>
raw powder containing the ZnO powder and then mixed, thereby preparing a slurry in<br>
which the concentration of ZnO powder was 30% by mass. Next, the slurry was<br>
spray-dried, thereby obtaining porous granulation powder having an average grain size of<br>
200 µm. The granulation powder was molded under a predetermined pressure, and the<br>
molded bodies were calcinated, thereby producing porous sintered body pellets (ZnO<br>
vapor deposition material). The porosity, average pore diameter, and average crystal<br>
grain size of the sintered body are shown in Table 1.<br>
[0435]<br>
[Comparative Example A1 ]<br>
The same raw powder as in Example Al was used, a slurry was prepared in the<br>
same manner as in Example Al except that introduction of air into the slurry, addition of<br>
a foaming agent, and use of an additive which will be volatized and dissolved upon<br>
calcination were not performed, and the slurry was spray-dried, thereby obtaining<br>
granulation powder having an average grain size of 200 µm. The granulation powder<br>
was molded under a predetermined pressure, and the molded bodies were calcinated,<br>
thereby preparing a sintered body pellet (ZnO vapor deposition material). The porosity,<br>
average pore diameter, and average crystal grain size of the sintered body are shown in<br>
Table 1.<br>
[0436]<br>
[Comparative Example A2]<br>
A slurry was prepared in the same manner as in Comparative Example Al except<br>
that 100 g of ZnO powder containing no CeO2 powder and Al2O3 powder was used, and<br>
the slurry was spray-dried, thereby obtaining granulation powder having an average grain<br>
size of 200 µm. The granulation powder was molded under a predetermined pressure,<br>
and the molded bodies were calcinated, thereby preparing a sintered body pellet (ZnO<br>
vapor deposition material). The porosity, average pore diameter, and average crystal<br>
grain size of the sintered body are shown in Table 1.<br>
[0437]<br>
[Deposition Test A]<br>
A deposition test A was carried out using the ZnO vapor deposition materials of<br>
Examples Al to A5 and the ZnO vapor deposition materials of Comparative Examples<br>
Al and A2. A vapor deposition material as a sample was put in the hearth (diameter 50<br>
mm, depth 25 mm) of the electron beam deposition device, adjustment was done in an<br>
atmosphere of an ultimate vacuum 2.66X10-4 Pa (2.0x10-6 Torr) and O2 partial pressure<br>
1.33x10-2 Pa (1.0x10-4 Torr), and an electron beam with an acceleration voltage of 10 kV<br>
and a beam scan area of about 40 mm*)) was irradiated to heat the ZnO vapor deposition<br>
material, thereby forming a ZnO film. The evaporation speed was measured by a quartz<br>
crystal thickness monitor provided obliquely above the hearth. The results are shown in<br>
Table 1. As shown in Table 1, in Examples A1 to A5, the deposition speed is about 1.1<br>
to 2 times higher than in Comparative Examples A1 and A2, and the evaporation speed is<br>
higher.<br>
[0438]<br>
[Moisture Resistance Test A]<br>
For the samples of Examples A1 to A5 and Comparative Examples A1 and A2, a<br>
moisture resistance test A was performed. In the moisture resistance test A, the<br>
resistance value of a film was measured hourly for 2000 hours in an atmosphere of<br>
humidity 60% and temperature 90°C. The results are shown in Table 2. As shown in<br>
Table 2, with regard to the moisture resistance of a ZnO film formed of a ZnO vapor<br>
deposition material containing Ce and Al, the deterioration rate of specific resistance is<br>
several times lower than a ZnO film containing no Ce and Al. This indicates that a ZnO<br>
film containing Ce and Al is several times more stable .<br>
[0439]<br>
[Examples A6 to A8]<br>
A porous sintered body pellet (ZnO vapor deposition material) was produced in<br>
the same manner as in Example Al except that adjustment was done such that the Ce<br>
content was 0.2% by mass, the Al content was 0.1% by mass, and the porosity was in a<br>
range of 8 to 31%.<br>
[0440]<br>
[Examples A9 to A11 ]<br>
A porous sintered body pellet (ZnO vapor deposition material) was produced in<br>
the same manner as in Example Al except that adjustment was done such that the Ce<br>
content was 14.9% by mass, the Al content was 10% by mass, and the porosity was in a<br>
range of 9 to 30%.<br>
[0441]<br>
[Comparative Example A3]<br>
A porous sintered body pellet (ZnO vapor deposition material) was produced in<br>
the same manner as in Examples A6 to A8 except that adjustment was done such that the<br>
porosity was 2%.<br>
[0442]<br>
[Comparative Example A4]<br>
A porous sintered body pellet (ZnO vapor deposition material) was produced in<br>
the same manner as in Examples A9 to Al 1 except that adjustment was done such that<br>
the porosity was 2%.<br>
[0443]<br>
[Comparative Examples A5 to A8]<br>
A porous sintered body pellet (ZnO vapor deposition material) was produced in<br>
the same manner as in Example A1 except that adjustment was done such that the Ce<br>
content was 20% by mass, the Al content was 15% by mass, and the porosity was in a<br>
range of 2 to 29%.<br>
[0444]<br>
For the samples of Examples A6 to Al 1 and Comparative Examples A3 to A8, the<br>
deposition test A was performed. The results are shown in Table 3. As shown in Table<br>
3, similar to Table 1, in Examples A6 to Al 1, the ZnO vapor deposition material has a<br>
high evaporation speed and excellent specific resistance, as compared with Comparative<br>
Example A Group. On the other hand, in Comparative Examples A2, A3, A4, and A8<br>
having a small porosity, the evaporation speed is considerably low at 13.0 to 14.7. In<br>
Comparative Examples A5 to A8 in which the Ce content and the Al content are high, the<br>
ZnO film has very large specific resistance and considerably low permeability.<br>
[0448]<br>
[Example B]<br>
Hereinafter, Example B Group of this aspect will be described together with<br>
Comparative Example B Group. In Example B and Comparative Example B,<br>
commercially available ZnO powder (having a purity equal to or greater than 99% and an<br>
average grain size of 0.3 µm), CeO2 powder (having a purity equal to or greater than 99%<br>
and an average grain size of 0.3 µm), and Ga2O3 powder (having a purity equal to or<br>
greater than 99% and an average grain size of 0.3 µm) were used. In any case, a slurry<br>
was prepared by using a ball mill (with a nylon-coated steel ball having a diameter of 5 to<br>
20 mm), and wet blending was performed for 24 hours. In any case, a uniaxial molding<br>
press device was used as the molding device, and molded bodies having an outer<br>
diameter of 6.7 mmF and a thickness of 2.0 mm were molded under pressure of 100<br>
kgf/cm (9.8 MPa). The molded bodies were put in an electric furnace and calcinated<br>
under air pressure at 1300°C for 3 hours, thereby obtaining sintered body pellets.<br>

An organic foaming agent and an inorganic foaming agent were added to 100 g of<br>
the same raw powder as in Example Bl, 1% by mass of polyvinyl butyral as a binder was<br>

the organic foaming agent, azodicarboxylamide and dinitrosobenta methylene tetramine<br>
were used, and for the inorganic foaming agent, carbonate was used. The foaming<br>
agent-containing slurry was put in a ball mill, wet blending was performed, then, the<br>
slurry was dry-comminuted after the dispersion medium in the slurry was vaporized by a<br>

pellets (ZnO vapor deposition material). The porosity, average pore diameter, and<br>
average crystal grain size of the sintered body are shown in Table 4.<br>
[0452]<br>
[Example B3]<br>
An additive which will be volatized and dissolved upon calcination was added to<br>
100 g of the same raw powder as in Example B1, 1% by mass of polyvinyl butyral was<br>

mm, depth 25 mm) of the electron beam deposition device, adjustment was done in an<br>
atmosphere of an ultimate vacuum 2.66x10-4 Pa (2.0x10-6 Torr) and O2 partial pressure<br>

and a beam scan area of about 40 mmF was irradiated to heat the ZnO vapor deposition<br>
material, thereby forming a ZnO film. The evaporation speed was measured by a quartz<br>
crystal thickness monitor provided obliquely above the hearth. The results are shown in<br>
Table 5.<br>
[0459]<br>
As shown in Tables 4 and 5, in Examples Bl to B5, the evaporation speed is high,<br>

high evaporation speed and excellent specific resistance, as compared with Comparative<br>
Example B. On the other hand, in Comparative Examples B4, B5, and B9 having a<br>
small porosity, the evaporation speed is considerably low at 13.0 to 14.1. In<br>
Comparative Examples B6 to B9 in which the Ce content and the Ga content are high,<br>

ZnO powder containing no CeO2 powder and B2O3 powder was used, and the slurry was<br>
spray-dried, thereby obtaining granulation powder having an average grain size of 200 µm. The granulation powder was molded under a predetermined pressure, and the<br>

[0506]<br>
[Deposition Test D]<br>
A deposition test D was carried out using the ZnO vapor deposition materials of<br>
Examples D1 to D5 and the ZnO vapor deposition materials of Comparative Examples D1 to D3. A vapor deposition material as a sample was put in the hearth (diameter 50<br>
mm, depth 25 mm) of the electron beam deposition device, adjustment was done in an<br>
atmosphere of an ultimate vacuum 2.66x10-4 Pa (2.0x10-6 Torr) and O2 partial pressure<br>

and a beam scan area of about 40 mmF was irradiated to heat the ZnO vapor deposition<br>
material, thereby forming a ZnO film. The evaporation speed was measured by a quartz<br>
crystal thickness monitor provided obliquely above the hearth. The results are shown in<br>
Table 13.<br>
[0507]<br>
As shown in Tables 12 and 13, in Examples D1 to D5, the evaporation speed is<br>
higher than in Comparative Example D1. In Comparative Examples D2 and D3, the<br>
evaporation speed is the same as in Example D5, but the specific resistance is large and<br>

[0515]<br>
For the samples of Examples D6 to D1 1 and Comparative Examples D4 to D9, a<br>
deposition test D was performed. The results are shown in Table 15. As shown in<br>
Table 15, similar to Table 12, in Examples D6 to D1 1, a ZnO vapor deposition material<br>
has high evaporation speed and excellent specific resistance, as compared with<br>
Comparative Example D. On the other hand, in Comparative Examples D4, D5, and D9<br>
having a small porosity, the evaporation speed is considerably low at 14.0 to 14.5. In<br>

[Deposition Test F]<br>
A deposition test F was carried out using the ZnO vapor deposition materials of<br>
Examples F1 to F5 and the ZnO vapor deposition materials of Comparative Examples F1 to F3. A vapor deposition material as a sample was put in the hearth (diameter 50 mm,<br>
depth 25 mm) of the electron beam deposition device, adjustment was done in an<br>
atmosphere of an ultimate vacuum 2.66x10-4 Pa (2.0x10-6 Torr) and O2 partial pressure<br>
1.33x 10-2 Pa (1.0x 10-4 Torr), and an electron beam with an acceleration voltage of 10 kV<br>
and a beam scan area of about 40 mmF was irradiated to heat the ZnO vapor deposition<br>
material, thereby forming a ZnO film. The evaporation speed was measured by a quartz<br>
crystal thickness monitor provided obliquely above the hearth. The results are shown in<br>
Table 21.<br>
[0557]<br>
As shown in Tables 20 and 21, in Examples F1 to F5, the evaporation speed is<br>
higher than in Comparative Example F1. In Comparative Examples F2 and F3, the<br>
evaporation speed is the same as in Example F5, but the specific resistance is large and<br>

for 2000 hours in an atmosphere of humidity 60% and temperature 90°C. The specific<br>
resistance of a film was measured hourly. The results are shown in Table 22.<br>
[0559]<br>
As shown in Table 22, with regard to the moisture resistance of a ZnO film<br>
formed of a ZnO vapor deposition material containing Y and B, Al, Ga, or Sc, the<br>
deterioration rate of specific resistance is several times lower than a ZnO film containing<br>
no elements described above. This indicates that a ZnO film containing Y and B, Al, Ga,<br>
or Sc is several times more stable .<br>

range of 5 to 29%.<br>
[0565]<br>
For the samples of Examples F6 to F1 1 and Comparative Examples F4 to F9, a<br>
deposition test F was performed. The results are shown in Table 23. As shown in<br>
Table 23, similar to Table 20, in Examples F6 to F1 1, the ZnO vapor deposition material<br>
has a high evaporation speed and excellent specific resistance, as compared with<br>
Comparative Example F. On the other hand, in Comparative Examples F4, F5, and F9<br>
having a small porosity, the evaporation speed is considerably low at 14.2 to 14.4. In<br>
Comparative Examples F6 to F9 in which the Ce content and the Ga content are high, a<br>
ZnO film has very large specific resistance and considerably low permeability.<br>

Sc, Y, La, Pr, Nd, Pm, or Sm is several times more stable .<br>
[0612]<br>
[Examples H6 to H8]<br>
A porous sintered body pellet (ZnO vapor deposition material) was produced in<br>
the same manner as in Example H1 except that adjustment was done such that the Ce<br>
content was 0.2% by mass, the Nd content was 0.1% by mass, and the porosity was in a<br>
range of 10 to 29%.<br>
[0613]<br>
[Examples H9 to H1 1]<br>
A porous sintered body pellet (ZnO vapor deposition material) was produced in<br>
the same manner as in Example H1 except that adjustment was done such that the Ce<br>
content was 14.9% by mass, the Pm content was 10% by mass, and the porosity was in a<br>
range of 10 to 31%.<br>
[0614]<br>
[Comparative Example H4]<br>
A porous sintered body pellet (ZnO vapor deposition material) was produced in<br>
the same manner as in Examples H6 to H8 except that adjustment was done such that the<br>
porosity was 2%.<br>
[0615]<br>
[Comparative Example H5]<br>
A porous sintered body pellet (ZnO vapor deposition material) was produced in<br>
the same manner as in Examples H9 to H1 1 except that adjustment was done such that<br>
the porosity was 2%.<br>
[0616]<br>
[Comparative Examples H6 to H9]<br>
A porous sintered body pellet (ZnO vapor deposition material) was produced in<br>
the same manner as in Example H1 except that adjustment was done such that the Ce<br>
content was 20% by mass, the Sm content was 15% by mass, and the porosity was in a<br>
range of 8 to 30%.<br>
[0617]<br>
For the samples of Examples H6 to H11 and Comparative Examples H4 to H9, a<br>
deposition test was performed. The results are shown in Table 31. As shown in Table<br>
31, similar to Table 28, in Examples H6 to H11, the ZnO vapor deposition material has a<br>
high evaporation speed and excellent specific resistance, as compared with Comparative<br>
Example H. On the other hand, in Comparative Examples H4, H5, and H9 having a<br>
small porosity, the evaporation speed is considerably low at 14.8 to 14.9. In<br>
Comparative Examples H6 to H9 in which the Ce content and the Sm content are high, a<br>
ZnO film has very large specific resistance and considerably low permeability.<br>
