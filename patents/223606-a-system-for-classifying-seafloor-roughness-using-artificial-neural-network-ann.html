BACKGROUND ART<br>
Hitherto known neural classifier for seafloor classification [Z. Michalopoulou, D. Alexandrou, and C. de Moustier, "Application of Neural and Statistical Classifiers to the Problem of Seafloor Characterization", IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering, Vol. 20, pp. 190-197 (1994)] describes a self-organizing map (SOM) network that is applied to multi-beam backscatter dataset. The drawback of this system is that it can use only processed data. Another drawback is its unsuitability for on-line application.<br>
An alternate system [B. Chakraborty, R. Kaustubha, A. Hegde, A. Pereira, "Acoustic Seafloor Sediment Classification Using Self Organizing Feature Maps", IEEE Transactions Geoscience and Remote Sensing, Vol. 39, No. 12, pp. 2722-2725 (2001)] describes a SOM network wherein single-beam dataset is used for seafloor classification, and this system is more suited to online use. However, a limitation of this system is that it requires pre-processing of the time-series dataset prior to classification.<br>
In US Patent Application No. 09/814,104 the Applicants have described a system which is incorporated in seafloor classification. This system described in this application estimates the seafloor acoustic backscattering strength with recorded root-mean-square (r.m.s) echo-voltage and the signal duration for each beam. In this system, multi-beam angular backscatter data have been acquired from the various seafloor areas around the Indian Ocean using a multi-beam acoustic system (Hydrosweep) installed onboard the Ocean Research Vessel Sagar Kanya. A drawback of the aforesaid system is that it requires large time-overhead to correct the raw data<br><br>
data using unsupervised learning as a pre-processor and supervised learning as the concluding block for improved classification, resulting in a highly efficient hybrid neural network layout to classify an unclassified dataset.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Fig. I represents the schematic of a single-beam echo-sounder, wherein an acoustic<br>
transducer [1] mounted beneath a survey ship [2] transmits acoustic pulses to the seafloor<br>
in a direction perpendicular to the sea surface and receives the echo that is backscattered<br>
from the seafloor. As the ship moves along a given preplanned track, a stream of<br>
successive echoes backscattered from the consecutive segments on the seafloor are<br>
received by an onboard receiver hardware and are recorded in its data memory module as<br>
a time-series dataset. A drawback of this single-beam echosounder is that the seafloor area<br>
coverage achievable in this manner is limited to the footprint of a single acoustic beam<br>
that impinges on the seafloor.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the schematic of a multi-beam echo-sounder [3] that is used for simultaneous<br>
seafloor mapping over large areas. In this geometry, the transducers are spaced in such a<br>
way that overlapping seafloor coverage is obtained. The fan-beam acoustic system<br>
consists of a linear array of transducers mounted beneath the ship's<br><br>
for range-related gain, seafloor slope correction, and insonification-depth<br>
normalization.<br>
Yet another system [B. Chakraborty, H.W. Schenke, V. Kodagali, and R. Hagen,<br>
"Seabottom Characterization Using Multi-beam Echo-sounder: An Application of the<br>
Composite Roughness Theory", IEEE Transactions Geoscience and Remote Sensing,<br>
Vol. 38, pp.2419-2422 (2000)] describes a system for seafloor classification, wherein<br>
it has been observed that the seafloor roughness parameters (power-law parameters)<br>
are the ideal parameters for classification. The drawback of this system is that seafloor<br>
classification can be implemented only after carrying out physical modeling of<br>
composite roughness parameters.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a novel system for seafloor<br>
classification using artificial neural network (ANN) hybrid layout with the use of<br>
unprocessed multi-beam backscatter data.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a system for on-line (i.e., realtime)<br>
seafloor classification using backscatter data after training the self-organized<br>
mapping (SOM) network and learning vector quantization (LVQ) network.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provides a system that incorporates a<br>
hybrid network using unsupervised SOM as the first block for coarse classification of<br>
the seafloor backscatter data and supervised LVQ for highly improved performance in<br>
the said classification.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a system which incorporates<br>
a combination of two variations of the LVQ layout to work together to achieve the<br>

In one another embodiment of the present invention, the roughness parameters are<br>
distinguished based on the ship's cross-track angular multi-beam signal backscatter<br>
shape parameter.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, each cluster formed represents an unique<br>
pattern of the input data.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the number of clusters thus formed is<br>
equal to the number of differing patterns of received seafloor data set.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the clusters are formed with the<br>
inherent unsupervised learning feature of the SOM preprocessor.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the clusters are formed without<br>
any prior knowledge of the number of the different types of input patterns.<br>

classification is achieved by supervised learning.<br>
In one another embodiment of the present invention, the supervised learning is<br>
imparted to the LVQ by a human interpreter based on the ground truth data set.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, said system incorporates a LVQ designed<br>

cluster or a LVQ designed to distinguish the overlapping tails of the weight<br>
distribution of adjacent clusters or a combination of both.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the LVQ designed to avoid<br>
misclassification at the central portion is based on "reward-punishment" criterion.<br>

from the input if it is wrongly represented and the weight-vector is made to match the<br>
input more closely if its correctly represented.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the LVQ designed to distinguish<br>
the overlapping of tails employs the technique of redistribution of the weights of the<br>
overlapping portion of the adjacent clusters to the respective parent clusters.<br>
In one more embodiment of the present invention, human interpreter can make use of<br>
the results displayed on the display device to make further judgements on the quality<br>
of classification.<br>
The present invention more preferably provides a novel system for seafloor<br>
classification using artificial neural network (ANN) hybrid layout with the use of<br>
unprocessed multi-beam backscatter data, which comprises of an artificial neural<br>
network system that consists of a self-organizing map (SOM) preprocessor [20],<br>
learning vector quantization variants LVQ1 [21] and LVQ2 [23], and the<br>
memory/display module [22], wherein the input to the said SOM network [20] is<br>
derived from the output of an r.m.s. estimator module [19], which received its input<br>
from an A/D converter [16], which in turn acquired its input from a beam-former [13]<br>
attached to two identical perpendicularly oriented arrays [7] and [8] of a multi-beam<br>
acoustic device of Fig. 3, the said signal after having been rendered into analog format<br>
and filtered with the use of appropriate electronic hardware circuitry [14] and [15]<br>
respectively; the said SOM network [20] receiving the unprocessed multi-beam<br>
backscatter r.m.s data derived from the different pre-formed beams, and classifying<br>
the seafloor data into various roughness types that are distinguished based on the<br>
ship's cross-track angular multi-beam signal backscatter shape parameter, wherein a<br>
unique cluster is formed to represent a specific pattern of the input data; the number of<br>
clusters thus formed being equal to the number of differing patterns of the received<br>
seafloor data set; the said clusters having been formed without any prior knowledge of<br>
the number of different types of input patterns; the said clusters of data set being<br>
subsequently input to the LVQ1 [21]; the imperfection in classification arising from<br>
the process of unsupervised learning without any background knowledge being<br>
partially overcome by the LVQ1 network [21] as in Fig. 5; the said improvement in<br>
seafloor classification achievable by supervised learning based on the feedback<br>
provided to the said LVQ1 network [21] by the human interpreter based on the ground<br>
truth data set using an appropriate weight-updating criterion, with a correctlyrepresenting<br>
weight-vector having been made to match the input more strongly, while<br>
a wrongly-representing weight-vector having been moved away from the input, so as<br>
to avoid misclassification at the central portion of the weight-distribution of each<br>
cluster; the outputs of the said LVQ1 [21] being subsequently input to the memory<br>
and display module [22], wherein the results thereby displayed having the utility for<br>
human interpretation to be made to enhance the quality of classification; the system of<br>
the present invention having the capability to incorporate an alternate hybrid layout<br>
wherein the LVQ1 [21] module could be replaced by another supervisable module<br>
LVQ2 [23] as in Fig. 6 that performs the alternate function of distinguishing the<br>
overlapping tails of the weight distribution of adjacent clusters to implement seafloor<br>
classification with minimal error; said system having additional capability to<br>
incorporate an improved hybrid layout, the said layout having the advantage of<br>
implementing seafloor classification based on the differing abilities of LVQ1 [21] and<br>
LVQ2 [23] as in Fig. 7, thereby providing the best possible classification, taking into<br>
account the central as well as tail portions of the weight distributions in the process of<br>
classification.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the neural network layout is a modelindependent<br>
system that would provides the capability to the use of unprocessed<br>
backscatter data from the seafloor for the purpose of classification.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, online seafloor classification is<br>
possible subsequent to the training phase of the network, thereby providing a costeffective<br>
system having the capability to circumvent the need for pre-processing of the<br>
raw data.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, a one-dimensional (i.e., bar-plot)<br>
presentation of a multitude of self-organized clusters of unprocessed (i.e., raw) input<br>
dataset and subsequent classification are provided to the human interpreter for further<br>
judgment of the quality of classification, and additional capability of visualization of<br>
the received input vectors in real time.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, said capabilities are extendable<br>
to the processed backscatter data as well.<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention, said system is capable of real-time<br>
redirecting cross-track multi-beam angular backscatter data received from the echosounder<br>
installed onboard the ship/AUV, to a remote databank.<br>
In one more embodiment of the present invention, said redirection is carried out by<br>
representation of an extensive dataset by a few clustering units as formed in the said<br>
system layout on a ping-by-ping basis.<br>
NOVELTY AND INVENTIVE STEP<br>
The novelty and inventive step of the present invention provides for an ingenious<br>
system for seafloor classification using artificial neural network (ANN) hybrid layout<br>
with the use of unprocessed multi-beam backscatter data, thereby circumventing the<br>

(i.e., real-time) seafloor classification using backscatter data after training the<br>
self-organized mapping (SOM) network and learning vector quantization (LVQ)<br>
network. Further, the system of the present invention has the unique capability for the<br>
combined application of unsupervised SOM followed by supervised LVQ to achieve a<br>
highly improved performance in the said classification, which is hitherto non-existent.<br>
The system of the present invention has the additional capability for the use of a<br>
combination of the two variations of the LVQ layout to work together to achieve the<br>
best results in seafloor classification.<br>

hybrid layout provides:<br>

circumventing the need for the conventional laborious and time-consuming<br>
preprocessing task that would have been required otherwise.<br>

self-organized mapping (SOM) network and learning vector quantization<br>
(LVQ) network using a large time-series dataset in the absence of background<br>
information.<br>

namely LVQ1 (that minimizes misclassification) and LVQ2 (that adjusts<br>
overlapping weights of adjacent clusters), to operate together to achieve the<br>
best results in seafloor classification.<br>

acoustic system consists of a linear array of transducers mounted beneath the ship's<br>
hull [4]. This fan-beam echo-sounder system consists essentially of two main subsystems,<br>
namely, acoustic sub-system [5] and data processing sub-system [6]. The<br>
acoustic sub-system comprises of a linear array of transducers installed at a certain<br>
suitable angular separation, cable-connection boxes, an array of transmit-receive<br>
systems for the respective transducer array, and usually a roll-pitch-heave sensor for<br>
input to the online processing system. The data-processing control system employs a<br>
shipboard computer, data-storage devices, and so forth. The multi-beam echo-sounder<br>
is a device that provides higher resolution seabed mapping. This system is capable of<br>
achieving a greater coverage as well as generating a high-precision map. The use of<br>
multi-beam echo-sounding system results in the generation of seafloor profiles, which<br>
are correlated with respect to the single central track, and allows more reliable<br>
correlation of intersecting tracks.<br>
Fig.3 represents a schematic of the beam configuration of the multi-beam echosounder<br>
used as part of the novel system of the present invention for seafloor<br>
classification using artificial neural network (ANN) hybrid layout with the use of<br>
unprocessed multi-beam backscatter data, which consists primarily of two identical<br>
arrays [7] and [8] of acoustic transducers mounted at right angles to each other. Each<br>
array is a combination of several sub-arrays [7.1],...[7.n] and [8.1],....[8.n]<br>
respectively, each consisting of a multitude of elements. These elements form a set of<br>
channels [9.1], [9.2], ....[9.n], each channel consisting of a group of elements in<br>
series. Similarly, for other counterpart transducer array, the receiving channels are<br>
[10.1], [10.2],....[lO.n]. Because both the arrays are identical, they can be used for<br>
either transmission or reception. In the receiving mode, signals from the different<br>
channels are pre-amplified, corrected for attenuation, and thereafter beam-forming is<br>
performed using appropriate delays. Altogether, a fixed number of pre-formed beams<br>
(p.f.b) are formed within the 90° swath. The beams are equally spaced (-1.5°), average<br>
beam-widths varying from 1.5° to 2.3° for deep-water surveys. The half-power beamwidth<br>
becomes approximately double when the system is operated in shallow water<br>
mode. The beam-formed outputs are tapped at the bottom-echo module to estimate the<br>
depth corresponding to the beams from different directions. In order to achieve<br>
uniform insonification over a swath of 90°, the system is designed to operate in a<br>
swath mode.<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates the block schematic of the signal processing hardware used for beamforming<br>
of the backscattered signal stream, which consists primarily of a pre-amplifier<br>
[11], time-varying gain adjustment circuitry [12], beam-former [13], digital-to-analog<br>
converter [14], filter [15], analog-to-digital (A/D) converter [16], bottom tracking gate<br>
[17], and display [18]. The digital data used for seafloor classification are derived<br>
from the output channel of the A/D converter [16]. This signal is input to an r.m.s.<br>
estimator module [19], whose outputs are used as the input vectors for further<br>
processing.<br>
Fig. 5 represents the schematic block diagram of the hybrid ANN layout used in the<br>
system of the present invention. This layout consists of a self-organizing map (SOM)<br>
network [20], learning vector quantization variant 1 (LVQ1) [21], and the<br>
memory/display module [22]. The input to the said SOM network [20] is derived from<br>
the output of the r.m.s. estimator module [19]. In the system of the present invention,<br>
the said SOM network [20] receives the unprocessed multi-beam backscatter r.m.s.<br>
data (whose pattern is the envelope of the r.m.s. signal amplitude versus beam number<br>
in the cross-track direction) obtained from the different pre-formed beams, and<br>
classifies the seafloor data into various roughness types. The different roughness types<br>
are distinguished based on the ship's cross-track angular multi-beam signal<br>
backscatter shape parameter. Each cluster so formed represents a unique pattern of the<br>
input data. Accordingly, the number of clusters formed is equal to the number of<br>
differing patterns of the received seafloor data set. These clusters are formed with the<br>
inherent unsupervised learning feature of the SOM network without any prior<br>
knowledge of the number of different types of input patterns. The clusters of the data<br>
set so formed by the SOM [20] are input to the LVQ1 [21]. The imperfection in<br>
classification, which is inherent in the said SOM network [20] due to the nature of<br>
unsupervised learning without any background knowledge (of the input data types), is<br>
partially overcome by the LVQ1 network [21]. This improvement in seafloor<br>
classification results from the supervised learning based on the feedback provided to<br>
the said LVQ1 network [21] by the human interpreter, judging from the ground truth<br>
data set. The said improvement is based on the "reward-punishment" criterion,<br>
wherein a correctly representing weight-vector is made to match the input more<br>
strongly, while a wrongly representing weight-vector is moved away from the input,<br>
so that it will avoid misclassification in future comparisons. The said LVQ1 [21]<br>
works more efficiently at the central portion of the weight distribution of each cluster<br>
formed in the SOM [20] than at the tail portion of the said distribution because of the<br>
inability of the said LVQ1 [21] to distinguish the overlapping tails of adjacent<br>
clusters. The outputs of the said LVQ1 [21] are subsequently input to the memory and<br>
display module [22], wherein the human interpreter can make use of the results that<br>
are thereby displayed to make further judgments on the quality of classification.<br>
Fig. 6 shows the schematic block diagram of an alternate hybrid ANN layout used in<br>
the system of the present invention together with the layout shown in Fig. 5. This<br>
layout is similar to the one given in Fig. 5, the only difference being that while the<br>
LVQ1 [21] avoids misclassification to a greater extent at the central portion of the<br>
weight distribution of each cluster formed in SOM [20] than at the tail portion of the<br>
said distribution, the LVQ2 network focuses on minimizing misclassification (arising<br>
in SOM) as a result of its ability to distinguish the overlapping tails of the weight<br>
distribution of adjacent clusters. The said LVQ2 [23] employs a technique for<br>
redistribution of the weights of the overlapping portions of the adjacent clusters to the<br>
respective parent clusters. The outputs of the said LVQ2 [23] are subsequently input<br>
to the memory and display module [22], wherein the results are displayed and stored<br>
to enable the human interpreter to make further judgments on the quality of<br>
classification.<br>
Fig. 7 illustrates the schematic block diagram of an improved hybrid ANN layout used<br>
in the system of the present invention together with the layout shown in Figs. 5 &amp; 6.<br>
This layout has the advantage of implementing seafloor classification based on the<br>
differing abilities of LVQ1 [21] and LVQ2 [23], thereby providing the best possible<br>
classification, taking into account the central as well as the tail portions of the weight<br>
distributions in the process of classification.<br>
Fig. 8 illustrates the clustering of the unprocessed data vectors presented to the<br>
aforesaid SOM network [20] and the supervised learning features of LVQ1 [21] and<br>
LVQ2 [23], both independently and combined. In this illustration, two weight-vectors<br>
located on either side of the boundary (shown as thick vertical line) have been<br>
designated as lying within the overlapping region of adjacent clusters. In the<br>
illustration of Fig. 8, the segments [24.1], [24.2], and [24.3] represent three<br>
consecutive weight-distribution-patterns [24] formed by the unsupervised SOM [20],<br>
wherein the symbols, (|), and (/) indicate three different classes of seafloor<br>
roughness parameters. As a representative example, the weight-distribution-pattern<br>
[25] at the output of the supervised architecture LVQ1 [21] clearly indicates the<br>
removal of the central misclassified portions  of [24.1] and [24.2], and their<br>
redeployment into the parent cluster represented by the segment [24.3], thereby<br>
providing a better redistribution in segments [25.1], [25.2], and [25.3] of the full<br>
weight-distribution-pattern [25]. The weight-distribution-pattern [26] illustrates the<br>
effectiveness of the supervised layout LVQ2 [23] wherein the segments [26.1], [26.2],<br>
and [26.3] indicate the removal of the misclassified data vector (/) from the tail<br>
portions of [24.1] and [24.3] of the SOM-output [24] and their redeployment into its<br>
parent segment [24.2] as shown in [26], while ignoring the classification error in the<br>
central portions of the weight-distribution-pattern in [26.1] indicated by (•). The<br>
weight-distribution-pattern [27] illustrates the effectiveness of classification with the<br>
combined use of LVQ1 [21] and LVQ2 [23] wherein the misclassifications found in<br>
both the central and tail portions of [24] are corrected to provide a fully corrected<br>
weight-distribution-pattern [27].<br>
Fig.9 shows a Table of roughness parameters and classification results (in percentage)<br>
for three seafloor areas examined using LVQ1, LVQ2 and a combination of both the<br>
above supervised layouts, using SOM as the preprocessor in each case.<br>
Generally, in the Hydrosweep multibeam echosounding system, the two outer beam<br>
values on the port side and the starboard side are erroneous and are neglected.<br>
Consequently, the original 59 beam input vector becomes an array of 55 beam values<br>
from angle -45° to +45°. In this embodiment, each of the 55 beam values for 5 input<br>
vectors at a time is averaged for input vector smoothening. By reducing variations in<br>
input patterns from the same seafloor region, we obtain marginally improved<br>
classification performance albeit at the cost of computational time.<br>
The preprocessor block uses unsupervised learning to form a self- organised mapping<br>
of 100 input vectors from various seafloors. The input data vectors are converted from<br>
the decibel scale to their natural values. Each vector is then normalised to match the<br>
range of the weights. The data is still unprocessed in the sense that no preprocessing<br>
algorithm (PROBASI) has been applied to it. From each seafloor area, a representative<br>
backscatter data set is chosen for training the SOM network. In this architecture,<br>
neighbouring entities called neurons compete with each other by the mutual lateral<br>
interaction of their weights. The weights in the neighbourhood of the closest matching<br>
neuron to the input vector presented are updated from an initial random distribution,<br>
so as to bring them closer to this input vector. This leads to the formation of local<br>
neighbourhoods, depicting a particular class. The learning rate is an exponentially<br>
decaying function 0.5/(t02) where / is the number of iterations, thus causing the rate of<br>
weight updating to be initially high and subsequently decreases gradually for finer<br>
tuning in successive iterations, until ultimately only one neuron excites in response to<br>
an input presented. At the end of execution of the SOM algorithm, the input space<br>
arranges into coarse clusters, each representing a unique input pattern, without any a<br>
priori information. Future input vectors presented in the testing phase are assigned to<br>
a cluster in the output space that best matches the input vector. The power law<br>
parameters (gamma and beta) for the different seafloor regions, obtained by physical<br>
modeling, are used to correlate the obtained results.<br>
The trained weight matrix after employing the SOM network are used as the inputs for<br>
a supervised learning network, namely LVQ. Here, training and testing is carried out<br>
simultaneously for a few iterations until the network weights belonging to each cluster<br>
are truly representative of that cluster. The learning rate is still exponential but with a<br>
much smaller initial value to allow fine tuning of neuron weights. In LVQ1, with user<br>
control for 3-4 input vectors from each class, the erroneously classifying weight vector<br>
is moved away from the input. If classification is correct, the weight vector is<br>
strengthened towards the input and eventually misclassification is avoided in further<br>
testing. LVQ2 goes a step further in overcoming the overlapping weight biases in<br>
regions of crossover of adjacent clusters by applying the window function at their<br>
boundary for correction to 1-2 neurons. The window is divided into half and<br>
corrections are made only when the excited neuron falls on the wrong side of the midplane<br>
by moving that vector away from the input and simultaneously bringing the<br>
neuron on the correct half of the window closer to it. A plot is made of probability<br>
density function (pdf) of excited neuron versus the frequency of excitation.<br>
In particular, we used three seafloor regions A, B and C for our comparative study.<br>
The classification results are tabulated in Fig. 9 for SOM, LVQ1 and LVQ2 for<br>
unprocessed backscatter data.<br>
On comparing the tabulated power law parameters (gamma and beta), acting as an<br>
indicator of seafloor interface roughness, with self-organized clusters after training by<br>
SOM, we have notice that areas A and C are of the same seafloor type. Between the<br>
two, classification results have indicated enhanced performance with LVQ for area C,<br>
which is rougher as indicated by its higher Chra value (rms roughness between two<br>
points separated by a distance of 100 m). The most significant contribution of this<br>
invention is the ability of the network to give superior response to unprocessed data,<br>
thereby eliminating the need for tedious preprocessing of the multi-beam backscatter<br>
data for seafloor roughness theory, thereby providing online indication of roughness<br>
even using raw data.<br>
ADVANTAGES OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
The main advantages of the present invention are:<br>

clusters in the output space without any a priori information.<br>

angular backscatter information by a few clustering units formed in the<br>
said system on a ping-by-ping basis.<br><br><br>
