FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The iiydraulic machine, which converts Ihe mechanical energy into Hydraulic energy is known hydrauHc machine. The hydraulic energy is in the form of Pressure energy. Iiydraulic machines such as centrifugal pump, jcl pump, submersible pump, etc.need a prime mover. Wlicrc as this siphon pumping is an innovative pump that can pump the Fluid without using any prime mover as in hydraulic Ram. This siphon pumping uses the difference in elevation between the two levels of reservoir to pump the fluid. The main difference between the Hydraulic ram and siphon pumping is there in no relatively moving part in siphon pumping. .    PRIOR OF ART<br>
Siphon system was generally used to transfer the fluid from higher reservoir to lower reservoir. In all siphon system all fluid will finally flow below the level of higher reservoir to lower reservoir, whereas in this siphon pump we made some amount of fluid to get collect in tank from the siphon system, which will be above level of higher reservoir.<br>
The following tabulation will explain about the difference between siphon pump and other related type of patent.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
and other gaseous comes out of water and it get collected at point y and stops siphoning process. Therefore the height elevation of point y is resistricted to certain level. FACTORS CONTROLLING SIPHONING:<br>
The main factor that controlling the siphoning process is the head elevation (h). Depending upon the head losses due to friction losses and minor losses, velocity of fluid wills change. This can be determined from the following derivation. From fig .1 Applying Bernoulli's equation between x and z<br>
(Px/gp) + (V^x /2g) +Z X = (Pz /gp) + (V^ z /2g) + Z z + losses of head from x to Z Px == P z =atmospheric pressure = 0; V x = V z Therefore the equation will become<br>
Z x - Z z= Head losses from x to Z h= Head losses from x to Z There will be one major loss due to frictional flow and number of minor losses depending upon our set up. Knowing all the sources of minor losses, frictional factor (f), length of pipe (1) and diameter (d) we can calculate its velocity from the following equation.<br>
(4flv^ / 2gd) + minor losses = Ah	equation 1<br>
Thus from the above equation we can calculate the velocity of fluid in the siphon. Now applying the Bernoulli's equation between x and y<br>
(Px /g p) +( V^x /2g; + Zr = (P y /g p) + (V^ /2g) + Z y + losses of head from XtoY<br>
Px = atmospheric pressure; V y =V x ; P y = minimum pressure i. e. 2.83 meters of water column; Z x=0<br>
10.33 + 0 + 0 - 2.83 + 0 + Z y + losses from x to Y<br>
8.5 -losses from x to Y = Z y	equation 2<br>
By calculating all the losses by knov/ing the velocity of fluid from the<br>
* * â€¢ equation 1 and substituting in equation 2 we can And the value of<br>
Z V i.e. the maximum height that the fluid can be lifted without cavitations<br><br>
SIPHON PUMPING:<br>
From the concepts of fluid flow in siphon we can understood that the fluid can<br>
be raised to certain height from the water level (tank a)while when it flowing from high<br>
pressure to lowfiressure. Although the maximum Jheight is resistricted if we could able to<br>
store the water at that critical point (y), we can pump the water to certain height without<br>
using any external agencies. Pressure point is point where the minimum pressure exits in<br>
siphon normally it will be at the maximum height from the raising portion i.e. point 'y'in<br>
figure 1.Pressure height is maximum height ^hat the water can be lifted Theoretically<br>
*<br>
pressure height can be up to 8.33 meters of water column absolute. But practically with losses it can be lifted near to it but it cannot reach because it will start cavitations.<br>
There can be two cases with Low head and high head.	Whenthere is<br>
low head then there will be low velocity of fluid in siphon and low frictional losses therefore there will be more pressure height but the discharge will decrease similarly when the head increases there will be high velocity more frictional losses therefore we will get lesser pressure height but there will be more discharge. Here we are using the fluid itself to pump the fluid to high level this could avoid the usage of an prime mover to pump the fluid. SIPHON TO SIPHON PUMP<br>
Previously from "fluid flow in siphon^^ we had seen that we can raise the fluid to certain height by simple siphoning process and we can able to store the fluid by means of following set up of pump. In this set up we are going to keep a collecting tank (3) which is completely closed, at the critical point (y) to store the fluid. Intially there will be some amount of air will be inside the collecting tank (3), when we remove the air inside the tank (3) then the fluid will get collected in it, from siphon tube. DESCRIPTION OF WORKING MODEL<br>
Previously we had seen that we can rise the fluid to certain height by simple siphoning process and we can store the fluid by means of following experimental setup.In thib experimental we are going to keep the collecting tank(3) at critical point lo store the fluid. Refer fig: 2<br>
JMrst ihc collecting tank is open to atmosphere so that it will have air only inside. It is then closed and some amount of water is poured into collecting tank (3) for<br><br>
the purpose of priming through the opening at the top of collecting tank (3) which has<br>
stop valve (7) for opening and closing of it. Now it is then closed. The amount of priming<br>
water is nearly 6 times the volume of suction tube (2).Since because of foot valve (1) and<br>
stop valve (6) water will not flow out of the tank. Now the suction tube (2) and delivery<br>
tube (5) is full of water. Venturimeter in the Venturi type siphon pump is removed. Here<br>
a small tube (4) half the diameter of delivery tube (5) is fixed inside collecting tank (3),<br>
such that one end of the tube is slightly above the inlet of delivery tube (5) and the end<br>
will be at the topmost portion of the collecting tank (3).	^<br>
Working<br>
When the stop valve (6) in the delivery tube (5) is opened gradually water will start flowing through the tube, since the collecting tank (3) is completely closed low pressure will be created inside the collecting tank (3) so that atmospheric pressure will push the water into collecting tank (3) through the suction tube (2) and the process of siphoning will start. Now while the water is entering the delivery tube(5) there will be a small amount of eddy force will be created at the inlet of the delivery tube(5), this eddy force will suck the air in the collecting tank(3) through the small tube(4) which is connected at the junction of delivery tube(5).Thus the air in the collecting tank(3) will be removed slowly through the tube(4), depending upon the amount of air is removed water gets collected in collecting tank(3).<br>
Thus after some time all the air in the collecting tank (3) will removed and it will be replaced by water. After all the air is removed stop valve (6) is closed to stop the siphoning. Thus now we had stored water in the collecting tank (3).It can be used for any purpose. To restart the process again care must be taken, some amount of water must be kept in collecting tank (3) for priming purpose. After water stored in the collecting tank it can be taken through the tapping take at the point'O' in the delivery tube (5) which is above the water level in the tank "A".<br>
To take the water out of the tank from the collecting tank(3), we have to open the stop valve (8) in the auxiliary tube (9) to allow the air to enter, vyhen water comes out of the collecting tank(3). At the times of v/hen pump working this stop vahe (8) must be closed.<br><br>
CALCULATION:<br>
The following reading has been taken from the prototype of venturi type siphon pump.<br><br>
Diameter of the suction tube and delivery tube is 25.4mm<br>
Ratio of venturimeter inlet to throat is 1:2.Capacity of collecting tank is 6 liter.From the<br>
tabulation it shows the efficiency of the pump is low and the ratio of suction tube (2) to<br>
available head is also low (i.e.) raising ratio.<br>
CALCULATION:<br>
The following reading has been taken from the prototype model of tubular siphon pump.<br><br>
Diameter of the suction tube and delivery tube is 25.4mm<br>
Capacity of collecting tank is 6 liter ^ Â« t l^rOm the above two tabulation it clear thai siphon pump - tubular type is more good<br>
than the venturi type siphon system.<br><br>
SIGNIFICANCE OF DIAMETER VARIATION<br>
We need the collecting tank (3) to be placed in the maximum height from the suction level (tank a) ,so we have to reduce the friction losses in the siphon system(refer equation 1&amp;2). For that if we keep the diameter of suction tube (2) as twice or thrice that of delivery tube (5) to reduce head losses in suction tube (2). Reason why we are not keeping the delivery tube (5) diameter as less is get required pressure to develop  to   suck  air  in  the  collecting  tank(3).   From  the  continuity  equation  of incompressible flow we know that vl= velocity of fluid in suction tube a1= area of cross section in suction tube v2= velocity of fluid in delivery tube a2= area of cross section in delivery tube<br>
al*vl =a2*v2 n*r1A2*v1'=n*r2'^2*v2 rlA2*v1      =   r2'^2*v2 v1 =v2(r2/r1)'^2<br>
if r1 = 2r2	v1 = (v2/4)<br>
if r1 = 3r2	v1 = (v2/9)<br>
Thus because of change in diameter between suction tube and delivery tube of thrice will reduce velocity by 9 times in suction tube, than when they are of same diameter.<br>
Similarly we know formula for frictional losses is (Pl*vV2gd) = Ah Therefore from the frictional losses equation, head losses will also decrease by square when velocity decreases.<br>
(Pl/2gd)*v^= Ah<br>
v-(vl/9)	(Pl/2gd)*vl^*(l/81) - Ah<br>
MULTI STAGING<br>
This siphon pump can be connected in series to pump fluid to for higher height. The output of one pump can be connected to another pump. Likewise number of<br><br>
pump that can connected in series, it has no limitation lor the number of stages tluil can be connected in scries, till there is lluid in previous stage next stage is there. This is an important feature of siphon pump. The way by which il can be connected in series is shown in fig3.<br>
Water collected in collecting tank (3) of pump (1) is stored in auxiliary tank (Al), which will act as suction tank for pump (2), tlic out coming water from the delivery tube of pump (2) is connected to suction tank (a) of pump (1) to rc-circulatc the water in pumpl. So that to pun)p again. The performance of all pumps and its working will same in each stage remain same.<br>
