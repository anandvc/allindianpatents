COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"HINGED LID STRUCTURE FOR VEHICLES"<br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan,   1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan,<br>
The  following  specification  particularly describes  the  nature  of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br><br>
ORIGINAL<br>
211/MUM/2002<br><br>
The present invention relates to a hinged lid structure for vehicles.<br>
[Technical Field of the Invention]<br>
The present invention relates to a hinged lid structure for vehicles for closing a recess or an opening formed on a vehicle body cover of synthetic resin for covering the vehicle body  frame with a hinged lid  of synthetic resin.<br>
[Description of the Related Art]<br>
As a hinged lid structure for vehicles, for example, those disclosed in the publications of (1) Japanese Patent Laid-open No.303490/1999, entitled. "Lid device" and (2) Japanese Patent Lain-Open No.227658/1999, entitled "Fuel lid device for scooter type vehicles" are known.<br>
The aforementioned invention (1) comprises, according to Fig. 2 of the patent publication of thesame invention, a<br><br>
lid portion 25, a pair of hinges 2 6 formed integrally with "the lid portion 25, a reinforcing member 29 being laid between the pair of hinges 26, the hinges 26 being rotatably mounted on the upper frame cover 17 , and the lid portion 25 covering around the oil filler port 23.<br>
The aforementioned invention (2) comprises, according to Fig. 3 in the patent publication of the same invention, a hinge 27 formed on the fuel lid 25, the hinge 2 7 rotatably mounted on a boss 28 on a vehicle body cover 11, a spring member 29 for urging the fuel lid 25 in the opening direction, and the fuel lid 25 for closing an opening 24 on the vehicle body cover 11.<br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
However, the lid device of the aforementioned invention<br>
(1) has no mechanism for opening the lid portion 25, it is<br>
necessary to open the lid member to the fully opened position<br>
under the user"s own power, and thus it takes a lot of trouble<br>
to open the lid portion 25.<br>
The fuel lid device for scooter type vehicles as in the aforementioned invention (2) comprises a spring member 2 9 for automatically opening the fuel lid 25 as a mechanism for opening the fuel lid 25. However, the fuel lid 25 pops up by a force of the spring member 29, and thus the feeling of operation sensed when opening the lid may be impaired.<br><br>
In other words, it is desirable to make a lid open spontaneously, and to open and close the lid with moderate motion.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention  to provide a structure for realizing a hinged lid for vehicles that provides a feeling of operation suitable for a large scooter.<br>
[Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
In order to achieve the aforementioned object, a hinged lid structure for vehicles according to Claim 1 provides a lid structure for closing a recess or an opening formed on a vehicle body cover of synthetic resin for covering the vehicle body frame with a hinged lid of synthetic resin, comprising a pair of arms extending from the hinged lid, the pair of arms being rotatably mounted on the vehicle body cover via hinges, a damper attached on one of the hinges that supports one of the arms for damping a speed of rotation, and a spring member attached on the other hinge that supports the other arm for urging the lid in the opening direction.<br>
For example, if it is possible to make a lid open spontaneously, and to open and close the lid with moderate motion, a hinged lid for vehicles providing a feeling of<br><br>
operation suitable for a large scooter is realizel<br>
Accordingly, a damper is provided on one of the fringes" that supports one of the arms for damping a speed of rotation of the lid, and a spring member is provided on the other hinge that supports the other arm for urging the lid in the opening direction, so as to enable compact storage of the spring member and the damper that are separately provided, and to realize a lid being capable of spontaneously opening and of opening and closing with moderate motion. In"other word, by releasing fixation of the lid, the lid is opened to the fully opened position spontaneously by the action of the spring member, and while it is being opened, a speed of rotation of the lid is damped by the damper.<br>
Consequently, the lid rotates smoothly with natural motion, which gives an upscale image, and thus a hinged lid for vehicles providing a feeling of operation suitable, for example, for the large scooter is realized.<br>
The present invention according to Claim 2 is characterized in that the damper employed is the rotary damper comprising a housing and a gear rotatably mounted on the housing, and in that an internal gear is formed on one of the arms about the axis of rotation thereof, the gear is directly engaged with the internal gear, and the housing is secured to the vehicle body cover.<br><br>
. The damper is enabled to support the rotary portion of the hinged lid for vehicles by forming an internal gear on one of the arms about the axis of rotation, directly engaging as gear with the internal gear, and securing the housing on tne vehicle body cover. By enabling the damper to support the rotary portion of the hinged lid for vehicles , the hinged lid structure for vehicles may be simplified. In other words, the cost of the hinged lid for vehicles may be reduced, and simultaneously, the number of steps required for assembling the hinged lid for vehicles may be reduced as well.<br>
The present invention according to Claim 3 is characterized in that the hinge for supporting the other arm is secured to the vehicle body cover via a reinforcing plate.<br>
Rigidity of the hinge is improved by securing the hinge for supporting the other arm on the vehicle body cover via the reinforcing plate.<br>
The present invention according to Claim 4 is characterized in that when the hinged lid is a lid for the oil filler port for covering the oil filler port of the.fuel tank, and the recess or the opening is a oil filler tray section formed integrally with the vehicle body cover, a pair of small through holes for passing the pair of left and right arms are formed on the oil filler tray section.<br><br>
Since the- pair of small through holes for passing the pair of arms are formed on the oil filler tray section, the through holes may be concealed from the outside with the lid for the oil filler port closed. Even when the lid for the oil filler port is opened, the through" holes are indistihctiye because they are small, and thus the appearance of the portion around the lid for the oil filler port may be improved.<br>

Fig. 22 is a side view of the main stand of the motorcycle. employing the hinged lid structure for vehicles according to the present invention. The main stand mounting structure is constructed in such a manner that the left and right hinge stays 322L, 322R are journaled on the left and right mounting brackets 218L, 218R mounted on the crankcase 217 for a swinging motion.<br>
Since the left and right hinge stays 322L, 322R are journaled on the left and right mounting brackets 218L, 218R of the crankcase 217 for a swinging motion, the distance from the grounding surfaces 336, 336 of the main stand to the pivot shaft may be reduced. For example, the cross member to be laid between the hinge stays 322L, 322R or the like may be omitted, and thus the cost of the main stand 320 may be reduced. .<br>
Fig. 23 is a sectional side elevation of the lid for inspection and the parts therearound of the motorcycle employing the hinged lid structure for vehicles according to the present invention. The lid for inspection 3 60 comprises a lid body 361, a front locking portion 362 formed on the lid body 361 for being caught under the center cover 24, and a rear locking portion 3 64 formed on the lid body 361 for hooking on the seat hinge supporting portion 131b, and a relief hole 363 formed on the lid body 3 61 for passing and releasing heat from<br><br>
the engine rearward.<br>
In the large scooter type vehicle, heat generaton ir the engine 211 is significant, and thus heat discharging measure has to be taken to details<br>
Accordingly, a relief hole 363 for concentrating the heat flow to the lid for inspection 3 60 for inspecting the engine 211 is formed to introduce heat Ql...generated at the engine 211 toward the seat bottom 208d as illustrated by the arrow Q2 and release the heat rearward by utilizing air blowing thereon during travel. Therefore, hot air around the engine 211 may be prevented from staying in the vehicle body cover 20.<br>
When inspecting the engine 211, the lid for inspection 3 60 is removed for performing inspection.<br>
Fig. 24 is an exploded perspective view showing the under-the-seat heat insulating structure of the motorcycle employing the hinged lid structure for vehicles according to the present invention. The under-the-seat heat insulating structure means an alignment of the under-the-seat tray 171 that is to be detachably mounted above the engine 211 for insulating heat generated at the engine 221 as well as for storing the tools (not shown). The reference numeral 172 is a tool storage section formed in the under-the-seat tray 171.<br><br>
Fig. 25 is a perspective view showing how to mount the, linder-the-seat tray on the motorcycle employing the hinged lid structure for vehicles according to the present invention<br>
For example, if heat generated at the engine 211 is insulated by integrally covering the upper portion of the engine 211 (See Fig. 24) by a luggage box or the like, it becomes a hindrance of inspection around the engine 211. Providing a special heat shielding plate for insulating heat generated at the engine 211 increases the number of the components.<br>
Accordingly, heat generated at the engine is insulated by arranging the under-the-seat tray 171 above the engine 211. In. addition,* the tool storing section 172 is formed in the under-the-seat tray 171 for enabling storage of tools (not shown). Providing the under-the-seat tray 171 above the engine 211 and under the seat 208 detachably on the vehicle body cover 20 does not impair workability of inspection around the engine 211.<br>
In other words, providing the under-the-seat tray 171 with heat insulating capability and storing capability, and detachably mounting the same on the vehicle body cover 2 0 may realize multi-functioning and improve workability of inspection.<br><br>
In the embodiment, as shown in Fig. 4 , three cross members of the front cross member 131, the middle cross member 132 and the rear cross member 133 are laid between the rear frames 115, 115. However, it is not limited thereto, and the number of the cross members to be laid between the rear frames may be selected as needed.<br>
[Advantages]<br>
The present invention in this construction provides the following advantages.<br>
According to Claim 1, since the cross members are detachably laid between a pair of left and right rear frames above the engine, a slight deformation of the pair of left and right rear frames may be accepted, for example, by tightening the bolt, so that the vehicle body frame that is well navigated between the soft and comfortable ride quality and rigidity may be realized.<br>
Since the cross members are detachably laid between the pair of left and right rear frames above the engine, maintenance around the engine may, easily be done only by removing the cross members.<br>
In Claim 2, since the pair of left and right rear frames are made of members of vertically elongated cross section, the vehicle body frame may be provided with well balanced rigidity<br><br>
and the soft and comfortable ride quality while ensuring vertical rigidity for supporting the seat and the rearcushion.<br>
In Claim 3, since the cross member also serves as a member<br>
for supporting the seat hinge of the hinged	seat when the,seat<br>
employed is a hinged seat, the number of the component may be reduced. As a conseguentv the cost of the vehicle body frame may be reduced.<br>
