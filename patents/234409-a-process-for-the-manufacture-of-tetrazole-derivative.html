The present invention relates to a process for the manufacture of tetrazole derivative.<br>
The invention relates to a method for preparing substituted tetrazoles, compounds obtained<br>
according to this method, new reactants and new tetrazole derivatives.<br>
Tetrazoles are structural elements, for example, of pharmaceuticals or agricultural<br>
compositions, foaming agents, automotive ktflators, and the like. Especially mentioned are<br>
the class of so-called angiotensin II receptor antagonists also designated nowadays as<br>
angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) that can be used e.g. for the treatment of<br>
hypertension and congestive heart failure. Most of said ARBs comprise as structural<br>
element a 5-tetrazole group.<br>
It is known In the art that tetrazole derivatives can be prepared by reacting various nitrites<br>
with organic azides in relatively good yields. Representatives of corresponding azides are,<br>
for example, organo-tin azides which have some toxic profile. They have to be handled with<br>
special care in production processes, cause ecological problems and require a significant<br>
amount of additional process work to recycle them from the wastewater thereby additionally<br>
inC1-easing the production costs. Tetrazole forming methods which use trlalkylammonium<br>
azides or tetraalkyfammonium azides may form volatile sublimates In the reaction reactors at<br>
higher temperatures which have the risk of explosion and are therefore not easy to handle in<br>
large scale production.<br>
There is a strong need to develop process variants, new reagents and intermediates that<br>
avoid the above-mentioned disadvantages. Especially, a lot of effort has been made to<br>
substitute corresponding organo-tin azides with alternative agents which are viable<br>
alternatives in the production of tetrazoles with sufficiently high yields.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that organo boron azides and organo aluminium azides can be<br>
used as alternatives to corresponding organo-tin compounds. Said boron and aluminium<br>
compounds are available in considerably large scales and are relatively inexpensive,<br>
especially corresponding aluminium compounds that are produced for the polymer industry<br>
(e.g. Ziegler-Natta catalysis). It has surprisingly turned out that high yields of tetrazoles can<br>
be achieved when using these organo azides to be used according to the present invention.<br>
Furthermore, as the corresponding boron and aluminium azides are not known to be toxiC1-<br><br>
their use does not require special care when recycling the waste water and moreover the<br>
dialkylmetal azides can be produced in a large scale at low costs and mild conditions. Even<br>
though, corresponding diaikyt boron and dialkyl aluminium azides have these advantages,<br>
they have not been desC1-ibed in the literature to be used in [2+3Jcycloadditions with nitriles<br>
to form tetrazoles. What is known from the literature is that e.g. di-organyl aluminium azides<br>
can be used to open epoxides and also to form acyl-azides from esters. However, the use<br>
of di-organyl boron or di-organyl aluminium azides, respectively, to form tetrazoles with<br>
nitriles is fully surprising.<br>
The present invention relates to the use of organo boron and organo aluminium azides,<br>
especially as defined below, for the manufacture of tetrazole derivatives.<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the manufacture of a tetrazole of formula<br><br>
or a tautomer or a salt thereof, wherein R represents an organic residue;<br>
comprising<br>
(i)      reacting a compound of formula R-CN (II a) with an azide of formula (Ri)(Rz)M-N3 (II<br>
b), wherein R has the meaning as defined above; R, and R2, independently of another,<br>
represent an organic residue such as an aliphatic residue, an alicyclic residue, a<br>
heteroalicyclic residue; an alicyclic-aliphatic residue; a heteroalicyclic-aliphatic residue; a<br>
carbocyclic or a heterocyclic aromatic residue; an araliphatic residue or an heteroaraliphatic<br>
residue, each residue, independently of another, being unsubstituted or substituted; and M is<br>
boron or aluminium; and<br>
(ii)     isolating the resulting compound of formula (t).<br>
A tautomer of a compound of formula (I) is a compound of formula<br><br><br>
A salt of a compound of formulae (I) or (!'), if the compounds of formulae (I) or (!') have, for<br>
example, at least one basic centre, can be an acid addition salt. This is formed, for example,<br>
with a strong inorganic acid, with a strong organic carboxyiic acid, or with an organic sulfonic<br>
acid. A corresponding acid addition salt can also be formed, if desired, with any additionally<br>
present basic centre. If the compounds of formulae (I) or (I1) have at least one acid group<br>
(for example COOH or 5-tetrazolyl) a salt with a base can be formed. A suitable salt with<br>
bases is, for example, metal salts, or a salt with ammonia or an organic amine. A<br>
corresponding internal salt may furthermore be formed.<br>

An inert solvent, diluent or mixture thereof should be selected which means that it cannot<br>
react with the starting material or intermediates. A suitable solvent is, for example, selected<br>
from the group consisting of aliphatiC1- cycloatiphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon, such as an<br>
Cs-C10-alkane e.g. heptane, a cycloalkane such as cyclohexane; and alkylated C3-<br>

temperature range is from about 20"C to about 170°C1- preferably, from about 60°C to about<br>
130°C or to about 140°C1- depending on the reactivity and combination of the reactants. A<br>
person skilled in the art is fully enabled to select corresponding suitable solvent and diluent<br>
systems and reaction conditions adapted to the choice of the solvent system and reactants.<br>
The reaction is most preferably carried out under anhydrous conditions.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the invention is carried out in a<br>
temperature range of from B0DC to 120°C1- preferably between 90°C and 110°C.<br>
The isolation step is carried out according to conventional isolation methods, such as by<br>
C1-ystallizing the resulting compound of formula (1), (IV), (IV c), (V), (VI), (VII), or (VII'),<br>
respectively, or a tautomer or salt thereof, from the reaction mixture or by chromatography of<br>
the reaction mixture, such as by C1-ystallizing the resulting compound from the reaction<br>
mixture - if desired or necessary after work-up, especially by extraction - or by<br>
chromatography of the reaction mixture. Reference in this context is also made to the<br>
working examples.<br>
Compounds of formula (II a) are either known or can be prepared using methods known in<br>
the art.<br>
Preferred are compounds of formula (II a), wherein R represents a carbocyclic or<br>
heterocyclic residues.<br>
The present invention likewise relates to a compound of formula (11 b). Preferred<br>
compounds of formula (II b) are those, wherein R, and R2, independently of one another, are<br>
C1-C10alkyl, C1-Caalkenyl, C3-C8-cycloa!kyl, alkylated Ca-Ce-cycloalky! or ar-CVC-alky!.<br>
12/<br><br>
especially methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyt, octyi, ally!, cyclopropyl, cyclopentyj,<br>
cydohexyl, methyl-cydohexyl, or benzyl.<br>
Azides of formula (11 b) can be prepared, for example, by reacting a compound of formula<br>
(R1)(RJ)M-X (II c), wherein M is aluminium or boron, R, and R2 have the meanings as<br>
defined above and X is a leaving group e.g. halogen, such as fluoride, chloride, bromide or<br>
iodide; or a sulphonate, such as an alkane sulfonate e.g. methanesulphonate; a halogenated<br>
alkane sulfonate e.g. trifluoromethansulfonate, an aromatic sulphonate e.g. tosylate; with an<br>
azide, preferably an alkaline metal azide, such as a lithium, sodium or potassium azide.<br>
The formation of an azide of formula (II b) is carried out, in particular, in the presence of an<br>
inert solvent or diluent or a mixture thereof, in a temperature range of 0°C to 120°C. The<br>
reaction is most preferably carried out under anhydrous conditions.<br>
Preferred azides comprise compounds of formula (II b), wherein R^ and R2, independently of<br>
one another, represent C1--Cfi-alkyl such as ethyl, iso-propyl, n-propyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, tert-<br>
butyl or n-octyl, C1-Ca-cycloalkyl, Cg-Ca-cycloalkyl-C^-Ca-aikyl or aryi-C.,-C8-alkyl such as<br>

boron azide such as diphenyl boron azide.<br>
It might be that, dependent on the kind of substituents, reactive substituents could also react<br>
with the azide. For example, an aromatic hydroxy group or a benzylic hydroxyl group may<br>
react with an azide of formula (II b), however, the resulting hydroxy function masked by a<br>
metal or by an organo metal group can be split with e.g. an acid resulting in a compound of<br>
formula (I); accordingly, in this situation, a higher amount of a compound of formula (l| a)<br>
needs to be used. An ester group might form an acyl-azide with a compound of formula (II<br>
b), while an epoxy ring structure might be opened with an compound of formula (II b).<br>
However, the person skilled in the art would be able to either directly anticipate that starting<br>
compounds with specific reactive substituents could not be used, as these substituents<br>
might react with the azide instead of the cyano function, or the person skilled in the art<br>
'3<br><br>
would, when corresponding side reactions are realized, protect corresponding reactive<br>
groups and lateron split-off the corresponding protecting groups by using conventional<br>
methods known per se.<br>
The process of the present invention likewise comprises protecting reactive substituents of<br>
compounds of formulae (II a) and (H b) and, after formation of the tetrazole ring, splitting-off<br>
the corresponding protective group(s), especially by using conventional methods known per<br>
se e.g. by the person skilled in the pertinent art who Is familiar with protecting and de-<br>
protecting functional groups.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, before the reaction of a compound of<br>
formula (II a) with a compound of formula (II b), a compound of formula (II a) wherein R<br>
comprises a reactive group that can be protected against the reagent of formula (II b) can be<br>
protected. Then a resulting protected compound is reacted as desC1-ibed herein with a<br>
compound of formula (I! b) and from a resulting compound the protecting groups is split off<br>
resulting in a compound of formula (I) or a tautomere thereof. This principle can likewise be<br>
applied to the manufacture of a compound of formulae (IV), (V), (VI), respectively.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of this variant, OH groups, such as aromatic e.g. phenolic or<br>
benzylic OH groups, can be either masked or protected, respectively. A corresponding OH<br>
group can be masked, for example, by treatment with a compound of formula (II d) M'fRa),,<br>
wherein M' represents a suitable element of groups 1a, 2a, 3a, and 4 a of the Periodic Table<br>
of Elements, especially an element selected from the group consisting of Li, Na, K, Mg, Ca,<br>

necessary, in a closed vessel, under pressure, in an inert gas atmosphere and/or under<br>
anhydrous conditions.<br>
Step fa) is carried out for example, in the presence of a base, e.g. first a nucleophilic agent<br>
followed by treatment with a saponifying base.<br>
A suitable nucleophilic agent is, for example, an alkaline metal salt of a C2-C1(r<br>

The reaction temperature is, for example, from 0°C to the boiling point of the solvent,<br>
preferably from 0°C to 130°C1- more preferably from 40°C to 80°C.<br>
The present invention relates to the reaction Step (a). This reaction step comprises two<br>
separate steps and it is suprising that the yield is nearly quantitative {&gt; 99% by weight<br>
theory). The present invention also relates to compounds of formula (VI b) whenever<br>
obtained according to process Step (a).<br>
Step (b): The molar ratio of an azide of formula (II b) and a nitrile of formula (VI b) is in a<br>
range from 5 to 1, preferably, from 3 to 1, most preferably, from 1,8 to 1 or from 1,2 to 1.<br>
An inert solvent, diluent or mixture thereof should be selected which means that it cannot<br>
react with the starting material or intermediates. A suitable solvent is, for example, selected<br>
from the group consisting of aliphatiC1- cycloaliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon, such as an<br>
Cs-C-Kj-alkane e.g. heptane, a cycloalkane such as cyclohexane; an alkylated Q,-C1-cycloalkane such as methyi-cyclohexane or 1,3-dimethyl-cyciohexane, an alkylated<br>
benzene such as ethylbenzene, toluene, xylene, cumene, or mesttylene; a halogenated<br><br>
aromatic solvent such as chlorobenzene, chlorotoluene, dichlorobenzene, and<br>
trifluoromethylbenzene; a halogenated hydrocarbon, for example, a halogenated aromatic<br>
compound, such as chlorobenzene. Furthermore, a suitable solvent, diluent or mixture<br>
thereof should have a boiling point that is high enough to be used under the reaction<br>
conditions.<br>
Preferred solvents or diluents are aliphatic hydrocarbons, for example, Cn-C^llcanes such as<br>
heptane; aromatic hydrocarbons, for example, phenyl substituted by C1--C4alkyl such as<br>
toluene or xylene, or mixtures thereof.<br>
The reaction temperature is preferred in the temperature range of from room temperature to<br>
the boiling point of the solvent, diluent or mixture thereof, for example, a reaction<br>
temperature range is from about 20"C to about 170°C1- preferably, from about 60°C to about<br>
130°C1- depending on the reactivity and combination of the reactants. A person skilled in the<br>
art is fully enabled to select corresponding suitable solvent and diluent systems and reaction<br>
conditions adapted to the choice of the solvent system and reactants.<br>
The reaction is most preferably carried out under anhydrous conditions.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the invention is carried out in a<br>
temperature range of from 80 to 120"C1- preferably between 90 and 110°C.<br>
The present invention likewise relates to reaction Step (b). Furthermore, the present<br>
invention relates to the compounds of formula (VI c) or a tautomer or a salt thereof in a form<br>
being completely free of tin. The present invention also relates to compounds of formula {VI<br>
c) whenever obtained according to process Step (b).<br>
Step (c): The oxidation is carried out in the presence of a suitable oxidizing agent.<br>
A suitable oxidizing agent is for example, an alkali metal hypochlorite such as lithium or<br>
sodium or potassium hypochlorite, calcium hypochlorite, "a Tempo" or an analogue (cf.<br>
Fluka) thereof or an oxidizing agent selected from the group consisting of HN02, HN03 or<br>
corresponding anhydrides thereof, and peroxodisulfates.<br><br>
When using e.g. an alkali metal hypochlorite as oxidizing agent, the oxidation is carried out,<br>
for example, in an inert solvent, e.g. a solvent that is inert against oxidation, such as a lower<br>
alkanecarboxylic acid, for example acetic acid, a heterocyclic aromatiC1- for example pyridine,<br>
a halogenated hydrocarbon, alkane nitrite, for example, acetonitrile, or water or a mixture<br>
thereof, if necessary with cooling or warming, for example from about 0° to about 50°C1- for<br>
example, at room temperature. In a preferred variant, the reaction is earned out in an<br>
aqueous medium and in the presence of a base. A suitable base is, among others, an<br>
alkaline carbonate, such as potassium carbonate.<br>
When using oxidizing agents such as HNOz, HN03 or corresponding anhydrides thereof, or<br>
peroxodisulfates, especially nitric acid, in a preferred variant an alkylated aromatic<br>
hydrocarbon such as toluene or xylene may be used as solvent. In a preferred variant of the<br>
oxidization with as HN02, HNQj or corresponding anhydrides thereof, or peroxodisulfates,<br>
the reaction is preferably carried out in a temperature range from about 0°C to room<br>
temperature or to 60"C. Surprisingly, no oxidation of the solvent is observed; i.e. the methyl<br>
groups in toluene or xylene are resistant to oxidation. Accordingly, the use of oxidizing<br>
agents such as HN02, HNOa or corresponding anhydrides thereof, or peroxodisulfates is<br>
likewise a subject matter of the present invention as is reaction Step c), especially when<br>
using as oxidizing agents such as HNOz, HN03 or corresponding anhydrides thereof, or<br>
peroxodisulfates in the an alkylated aromatic hydrocarbon solvent, especially in toluene and<br>
xylene. In another preferred variant, HN03 is used in water free form or in an aqueous<br>
solution from about 40% to about 95%, preferably from 40 to 65 %.<br>
The use of oxidizing agents such as HN02, HN03 or corresponding anhydrides thereof, or<br>
peroxodisulfates, especially nitric acid, provides surprising results. For example, the<br>
corresponding oxidization to an aldehyde is effected without further oxidizing the aldehyde<br>
function to the carboxy group. Accordingly, the use of said oxidizing agents is likewise a<br>
subject matter of the present invention.<br>
The present invention also relates to compounds of formula (VI) whenever obtained<br>
according to process Step (c).<br>
Step (d): The isolation step of a compound of formula (VI) is carried out according to<br>
conventional isolation methods, such as by C1-ystallizing the resulting compound of formula<br><br><br>

comprising the reaction sequence comprising<br><br><br><br><br>
The reactions desC1-ibed above and below In the variants are carried out, for example, in the<br>
absence or, customarily, in the presence of a suitable solvent or diluent or a mixture thereof,<br>
the reaction, as required, being carried out with cooling, at room temperature or with<br>
warming, for example in a temperature range from about -flO°C up to the boiling point of the<br>
reaction medium, preferably from about -10°C to about +2Q0°C1- and, if necessary, in a<br>
dosed vessel, under pressure, (n an inert gas atmosphere and/or under anhydrous<br>
conditions.<br>
Compounds of formulae (VIII a), (VIII b). (VIII c) and {VIII e), wherein either or both of R, and<br>
Rs are hydrogen can farm salts with bases, as both the unprotected tetrazota ring and the<br>
unprotected carboxy group have addic properties, while compounds of formulae (VIII b) and<br>
(VIII c) can also form salts with acids.<br>

Stapfb'):<br>
In reaction SteeibJ, the acytetion Is carried out for example. In absence or In presence of a<br>
suitable base.<br><br>
Suitable bases are, for example, alkali metal hydroxides or carbonates,<br>
morpholine or piperidine amines, unsubstituted or substituted pyridines, anilines,<br>
naphthalene amines, IrMVCT-alkyia mines, basic heterocycles or tetra-Cl-C7-alkyl-<br>
ammonium hydroxides. Examples, which may be mentioned, include sodium<br>
hydroxide, potassium carbonate, triethylamine, tri-propyl-amirte, tri-butyl-amine or<br>
ethyidiisopropylamirte, N-methyl-morpholine or N-methyl-piperidine, dimethyl-<br>
aniline or dimethylamino-naphthalene, a lutidine, a collidine, or<br>
benzyltrimethylammonium hydroxide. A preferred base is a tri-C1--C4-alkylamine<br>
such as ethyl-diisopropyl-amine or is pyridine.<br>
The acylation is carried out in a suitable inert solvent or in a mixture of solvents.<br>
The person skilled in the art is fully enabled to select a suitable solvent or solvent<br>
system. For example, an aromatic hydrocarbon such as toluene, an ester such as<br>
ethylacetate or a mixture of ethylacetate and water, a halogenated hydrocarbon<br>
such as methylene chloride, a nitrile such as acetonitriie of proprionitriie, an ether<br>

dtrnethytforrnamide, or a hydrocarbon, such as toluene, is used as solvent.<br>
During the acylation of a compound of formula (VIII c), if R2 is hydrogen, the<br>
carboxyl-group might also be acylated forming a mixed anhydride. This<br>
intermediate is strongly prone to racemisation, mainly under basic conditions.<br>
Racemisation however can be avoided by first adding the compound of formula<br>
(VIII d), especially the halide, to the compound of formula (Vlllc) in a suitable inert<br>
solvent (e.g. dimefhoxyethane, tetrahydrofuran or acetonitril), then slowly adding a<br>
sub-stoichiometric amount of the base, especially pyridine, in relation to the<br>
compound of formula (Vill d). Small amounts of water in the reaction mixture,<br>
preferably two equivalents, may additionally suppress racemisation.<br>
The reaction can also be carried out by simultaneous or alternative addition of a<br>
compound of formula (VIII d) and a base such as pyridine keeping the reaction<br>
mixture acidic at all times.<br><br>
If R^ represents a protecting group and the tetrazole ring is unprotected or<br>
protected by a protecting group, for example, two equivalents of both a compound<br>
of formula (VIII d), e.g. the corresponding halide thereof, and a base, e.g. ethyl-<br>
diisopropyl-amine or tri-n-propylamine are added to a corresponding compound of<br>
formula (VHl c) dissolved in a suitable solvent, e.g. toluene. No racemisation is<br>
observed.<br>
If the tetrazole ring is unprotected and R^ is a protecting group, the tetrazole ring<br>
might also be acylated. When, however, the reaction mixture is quenched, for<br>
example with water or an alcohol such as methanol, the corresponding compound<br>
can be obtained wherein the tetrazole ring is unprotected.<br>
Compounds of formula (VIII d) are known or can be manufactured according to<br>
methods known per se.<br>
