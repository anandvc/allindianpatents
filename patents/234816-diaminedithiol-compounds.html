				<td>NEW DIAMINEDITHIOL DERIVATIVES AND RADIORHENIUM OR RADIOTECHNETIUM COMPLEX THEREOF; A LIVER CANCER-TREATING COMPOSITION COMPRISING THE RADIORHENIUM COMPLEX AND LIPIODOL; AND A KIT FOR PREPARATION OF THE LIVER CANCER-TREATING COMPOSITION<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a novel diaminedithiol derivative or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; a radiorhenium or radiotechnetium complex thereof; a composition for treating liver cancer comprising the radiorhenium complex and lipiodol; and a preparative kit of the composition for treating liver cancer.<br>
Background Art<br>
Liver cancer especially affects oriental countries, including Korea at a high incidence and mortality rate. The liver cancer can be treated by surgical operation in an early stage, when metastasis of cancer cells has not occurred and their size is small. However, as the disease is progressed, the treatment by the surgical operation becomes ineffective. In this case, hepatic arterial embolization is generally used.<br>
Normal liver tissue is supplied with blood and oxygen through both portal veins and arteries, particularly, for the blood the portal veins and arteries being responsible for 75% and 25%, respectively, of the total supply, and for the oxygen the portal veins and arteries being responsible for 50% and 50%, respectively, of the total supply. However, as for a cancerous tissue of the liver, the portal veins take 90% in supplying blood. Based on this fact, if embolic material embolizing to capillary vessel is injected to the hepatic artery of a liver cancer patient, the material is migrated mainly to the liver cancer tissue, causing embolization thereto. One example of the embolic materials is lipiodol.<br>
Lipiodol is a lipid-soluble contrast medium obtained by iodination and esterification of poppy seed oil. Lipiodol has been employed as a contrast medium for imaging lymph nodes. It is easily able to cause<br>
capillary embolism due to. 38 .weight % iodine and high viscosity at room temperarure. Therefore, injection of lipiodol to the hepatic artery of a patient with liver cancer results in lipiodol being concentrated into .the liver cancer tissue. Using such information, there were several attempts to treat liver cancer by injecting anticancer agent-assembled lipiodol to the liver cancer tissue.<br>
A method by which lipiodol is labeled with a radioisotope and idminisiered via a hepatic artery to treat liver cancer had been used. It was reported that when administered to patients with liver cancer, 131I-labelled lipiodol is accumulated in liver cancer tissue (M. Nakajo et al., Biodistribution and in vivo kinetics of iodine-131 lipiodol infused via the ieoatic artery of patients with hepatic cancer, J. Nucl. Med., 29: 1066-1077, 1988). And, distribution in vivo of 90Y-labelled lipiodol was studied (S-J Wang et al., Preparation and biodistribution of yttrium-90 lipiodol in rats following hepatic arterial injection, Eur. J. Necl. Med., 22: 233-236, 1995). However, there are disadvantages in that 1-131 is an isotope not suitable for lie treatment, and Y-90 is costly and hard to be imaged, limiting the use â€¢.hereof. Articles were published to report Re-188 labeling to overcome the ibove disadvantages (S-J Wang et al., Radiolabelling of lipiodol with generator-produced 138Re for hepatic tumor therapy. Appl. Radiat. Isot., 47: 267-271, 1996; S-J Wang et al., Biodistribution of rhenium-188 lipiodol infused via the hepatic artery of rats with hepatic tumors, Eur. J. Nucl. Med., 23:13-17, 1996). However, the methods presented by these articles need improvement since the labeling method is complicated and the labeling efficiency and its stability are low.<br>
To improve the labeling method, diaminedithiol derivatives with iikyl chain nave been developed (TW Jackson et al., Rhenium diamino dithiol complexes. III Lipophilic ligands for endotherapeutic radiopharmaceuticals. Aust. J. Chem. 53:983-987). They synthesized diaminadithiol derivatives with long alkyl chain of C1-C14 and labeled them with radiorhenium. What they found was that only diaminedithiol derivatives with alkyl chain of C1C10 showed enough stabiliry for treatment of liver cancer. They found that diaminedithiol derivatives with alkyl chain longer than C10 were not stable. Actually, they reported that the yield of completing rhenium and diaminedithiol containing C10 alkyl chain was so<br>
poor that they failed to get enough amount of complex for analysis. It would have been even more difficult for them to obtain rhenium complex with diaininecithiol containing longer alkyl chain in their experiment. That is why they gave up diaminedithiol containing alkyl chain longer than C10. They chimed diaminedithiol derivatives with alkyl chain of C1-C10 for treatment of liver cancer in US Patent 5,496,533. However in our experiment, diaminedithiol containing alkyl chain longer than C10 could make stable lipophilic complex with 138Re. Furthermore, we found that diaminedithiol derivatives with alkyl chain shorter than C13, which includes the compounds in US Patent 5,496.533, were not lipophilic enough to be retained in the tissue, which would result in rapid clearance from cancer tissue. We have proved that diaminedithiol derivatives should have alkyl chain longer than C14, and that is our major claim in this patent.<br>
Meanwhile, diaminedithiol has a structure represented in Formula 1 below. It was synthesized and known to make stable lipophilic complex with technetium or rhenium (HF Kung, et al. Synthesis and biodistribution of neutral lipid-soluble Tc-99m complexes that cross the blood-brain barrier. L Nucl. Med. 25:326-332, 1984). Davison et al described a variety of complexes of substituted anionic diaminedithiol with Tc-99m as an agent for imaging kidney, which was published on March 27, 1985 in Europe Pat. Appln. No. 135,160.<br>
[Formula 1]  (Figure Removed)<br>
wherein. R1 to R12 are independently hydrogen, alkyl having C1 to C3, or -COOR (in which R is -CH3) -C2H5 or -C3H7); provided that among substiuents R1 to R12:, only R3, R5) and R7 to R10 may be -COOR.<br>
A kit comprising a neutral lipid-soluble ester-substituted diaminedithiol is disclosed in Korean Pat. Laid-open No. 92-2167. According to the reference, using a method by which thiazolidine is dimerized via reduction to prepare a N.N'-l,2-ethylenebis-L-cysteine derivative and esters thereof (Blondeau et al., Can. J. chem.., 45:46, 1967), ligand is synthesized and labeled with Tc-99m to form a neutral lipid-soluble complex, being directed to imaging blood flow in the brain.<br>
In U.S. Pa:. No. 5,980:860 published on November 9 1999, it is described :hat diaminedithiol derivatives are synthesized by introducing tropane group to use as a radiopharmaceutical for imaging dopamine transporter.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Therefore, the present invention has been made in view of the above problems, and it is an'object of the present invention to provide a novel<br>
diaminedithiol derivative and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a complex of diaminedithiol derivative-radiorhenium or a complex of diaminedithiol derivative-radiotechnetiurn.<br>
It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a composition for treating liver cancer comprising a complex of novel diaminedithiol derivative-radiorhenium, which is able to be prepared easily and is stable after preparation, characterized by its high and durable accumulation in liver cancer tissue, thereby being capable of efficiently treating liver cancer without any side effect.<br>
In particular, it is an important object of the invention to provide a more effective composition for treating liver cancer, which compensates for a shortcoming that a complex of diaminedithiol-rhenium fails to be retained in a tissue for a long time.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a novel diaminedithiol derivative having long chain alkyl groups, represented in Formula 2 below (hereinafter, referred to as diaminedithiol derivative) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; a radiorhenium or radiotechnetium complex thereof; a composition for treating liver cancer comprising the radiorhenium complex and lipiodol; and, a preparative kit of the composition for treating liver cancer.<br>
The diaminedithiol derivative of the present invention, represented in Formula 2 below, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are novel compounds and form complexes with radiorhenium or radiotechnetium. The complex compound of diaminediihiol derivative-radiorhenium creates stronger Van der Waals bonds by the introduction of long chain alkyl groups. As a result, the complex becomes more stable in the medium. lipiodoi. â€¢ Moreover, a techneiium complex of diaminedithiol derivative may be an agent for imaging blood flow in the lung via intravenous injection after being dissolved in lipiodol or oil which is a liquid at room temperature.<br>
[Formula 2]   (Figure Removed)<br>
wherein:<br>
R2 , R3, R8 to R14 are independently hydrogen or lower alkyl having C1 to C5; R1; and R5 are independently hydrogen or lower alkyl having C1 to C5 or they form oxo, (=0) group; R6 and R7 are independently hydrogen or lower alkyl having C1 to C5 or they form oxo (=0) group', in which at least one of R2 to R14 is higher alkyl having C15 to C24 and R4 to R7 don't form two oxo (=O) groups at the same time;<br>
R1 and R15 are independently hydrogen or thiol protecting group such as benzoyl. acetamidomethyl, diphenylrnethyl, ethylaminocarbonyl, t-butyl, trityl and aceryl, or Rt and R|5 together form a S-S bond; and.<br>
n, o, p are independently 1 or 2.<br>
In the above, if RI and Ri5 are thiol protective groups, they should be removed immediately before or when being labelled to form a thiol group.<br>
In :he above Formula 2, as for the preparation of a composition for treating liver cancer, diaminedithiol derivatives in which RIO is higher alkyl having C15- to C24. or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are preferable. More preferably, diaminedithiol derivatives in which R10 is higher alkyl having C15 to C20, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may be employed. In addition, it may be expected that a diaminedithiol derivative in which R10 is linear alkyl without a branch, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof offers more desirable effects.<br>
In the above Formula 2, diaminedithiol derivatives in which n. o and<br>
s<br>
p are all together 1 or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may be<br>
preferably employed for the preparation of a composition for treating liver cancer.<br>
Furthermore, diaminedithiol derivatives in which all the above conditions are met; R2R3, R13 and R!4 are all together methyl; R1, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9, R11, R12 and R15 are all together hydrogen, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may be most preferably employed.<br>
Meanwhile, in the above Formula 2, R4 and R5 or R6 and R7, can be independently oxo (=0) group. If the compound has two or more oxo (=0) groups, its suitability decreases as an ingredient for a composition for treating liver cancer. Therefore, the compound which has only one oxo (=0) group may be preferably employed for the preparation of a composition for treating liver cancer.<br>
A composition for treating liver cancer of the invention comprises a complex of diaminedithiol derivative-radiorhemum and lipiodol. A method for preparing the composition comprises the steps of reacting a diaminedithiol derivative, a reducing agent and an additive with radiorhenium or radiotechnetium to form a complex and dissolving the complex in lipiodol.<br>
Radiorhenium used herein for forming a complex with a diaminedithiol derivative is either 186Re or 188Re and radiotechnetium used is 99mTc. A reducing agent is used to reduce radiorhenium or radiotechnetium so as to allow binding with diaminedithiol. The reducing agent may be, for example, tin chloride, vitamin C, iron chloride, dithiom'te or sodium sulfite, and especially, tin chloride is preferable. Additives may be added for preventing the formation of byproducts upon radioisotope labeling and increasing the labeling efficiency as well as for improving a quality including chemical and physical stabilities of the labeling. The.additives may be, for example, tartaric acid, gluconic acid, glucoheptonic acid, lactic acid, MDP, lactose, EDTA, gentisic acid, and especially, tartaric acid is preferable.<br>
In view of the course of labeling with radiorhenium or radiotechnetium, when materials and methods disclosed in the prior art (S-J Wang et al., Radiolabelling of lipiodol with generator-produced 188Re for hepatic tumor therapy, Appl. Radiat. Isot., 47: 267-271, 1996) are employed for labeling, ammonium carbonate solution is boiled, acetic acid is added,<br>
followed by evaporation under a nitrogen gas atmosphere, taking over 5 hours to get through the serial steps. On the other hand, labeling the diaminedithiol derivative used in this invention with radiorhenium is achieved within 1 hour and the complex formed has an excellent stability.<br>
Lipiodol as a component for the composition of the invention, as described in the above section, is a lipid-soluble material. It was found by Nakamura et al in 1983 that lipidol is selectively accumulated in the liver cancer tissues. The composition according to the invention comprises lipiodol as a medium, being capable of accumulating a complex of diaminedithiol-radiorhenium or a complex of diaminedithiol-radiotechnetium, an active ingredient, in liver cancer tissues or lung tissues. The lipiodol content in the composition is any amount which can dissolve a complex of diaminedithiol-radiorhenium formed. Preferably, lipiodol may be employed in amount of 0.5 ml to 50 ml, relative to 1 mg of a diaminedithiol derivative.<br>
As an active ingredient of the invention, a complex of diaminedithiol-radiorhenium is so highly lipid-soluble that it is well dissolved in lipiodol, an oil-based X-ray contrast medium. Thus, when lipiodol is used as a medium, injection of the , complex of diaminedithiol-radiorhenium together with lipiodol through the hepatic artery causes embolization in capillary vessels of the liver cancer tissue, thereby the active ingredient being accumulated. A complex of diaminedithiol-radiorhenium is highly lipid-soluble so it remains dissolved in lipiodol and does not diffuse into surrounding tissues, whereby the complex is retained in the cancer tissue as long as lipiodol is held, finally achieving a selective radiation effect, thereby capable of selectively removing tumor cells.<br>
With regard to the concrete method of preparing a composition for treating liver cancer of the invention, first, a diaminedithiol derivative reacts with radiorhenium in the presence of a reducing agent and an additive to form a complex. To the complex in aqueous solution is added lipiodol and the solution is mixed well. The lipid-soluble complex is mixed with lipiodol and the mixture is centrifuged, separating into two phases. The lower phase comprising lipiodol is taken out using a syringe to obtain a composition for treating liver cancer according to the invention.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention is a preparative kit of the above composition for treating liver cancer comprising a first container<br>
containing a lyophilized diaminedithiol derivative, a reducing agent and an additive; and a second container containing Hpiodol which can be subjected to a direct centrifugation. The reducing agent and additive are defined as above. Meanwhile, radiorhenium may be supplied from other sources immediately before use.<br>
Further, in the above preparative kit of the composition for treating liver cancer, lipiodol may be supplied from other sources, thus, the kit is characterized by comprising a first container containing a lyophilized diaminedithiol derivative, .a reducing agent and an additive, whereby a preparative kit comprising a complex of diaminedithiol derivative-radiorhenium in the composition for treating liver cancer is also available.<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in detail, in conjunction with various examples. These examples are provided only for illustrative purposes, and the present invention is not to be construed as being limited to those examples.<br>

Example 8: Preparation of 138Re-IabeIIed compound in lipiodol<br><br>
solution<br>
iss<br>
To the Re-labelled reaction mixture prepared in the foregoing Examples 4 to 6, lipiodol (5 ml) was added, mixed well and the solution was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was removed and 2 ml saline was added. After mixing well, the resulting solution was centrifuged again at 3000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was removed to recover a lower phase of lipiodol.<br>
Experimental example 1: Observation of increased accumulation and retention of 138Re-labelled compounds in animal tissues<br>
Mice (ICR) were administered with an injection of 188Re-labe:!ed compound in lipiodol solution which was prepared in the Example 7 via the tail vein. Radioactivity distributed in tissues and weight of each tissue were measured to calculate the percentage of radioactivity per gram of unit tissue relative to total radioactivity administered.<br>
As radiation accumulation mechanism in the lung and the liver cancer<br><br>
are similar, it is convenient to detect the level of radiation accumulating in the lung of 3 mouse suffering from liver cancer. As found in Tables 1 to 4, compounds with a long side chain (Tables 2 to 4) more readily accumulated in the lung, and the clearance rate is slower than for compounds without a long side chain (Table 1). Therefore, it can be inferred that a radiorhenium complex of a diaminedithiol derivative having a long side chain is effective for treating liver cancer.<br>
