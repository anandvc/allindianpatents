				<td>A composition and process for inducing organized shoots for micro-propagation of scented Pandanus amaryllifolius Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method of clonal propagation of Pandalnus amaryllifolius. The present invention relates to a composition for the clonal propagation of scented Pandanus amaryllifolius.<br>
Background art<br>
Pandanus amaryllifolius is a member of the family Pandanaceae comprising a<br>
group of plants generally known as 'screw pines'. Earlier studies by Buttery ef<br>
al (Chem. Ind. London, Vol. 23, page 478 of year 1982) indicated that 2-acetyl-<br>
1-pyrroline is the major flavour constituent of Pandanus leaves, while other<br>
constituents like volatile oils, alcohols, aromatic aldehydes, ketones and esters<br>
were also traceable. The major compound, 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, has<br>
commercial significance as a major flavour constituent that impart the<br>
characteristic aroma of scented rice varieties such as Basmati rice of India,<br>
Khao Dawk Mali-105' of Thailand and Kaorimai of Japan. The essential oil of<br>
Pandanus is known to impart 10-times more flavour than the highly scented<br>
rice and 100-times more than that present in normal rice (Chem. Ind. London<br>
Vol. 23, page 478 of year 1982). Pandanus extract has been reported to<br>
possess	anti-oxidant	properties	(http://www-<br>
anqlkfunigraz.ac.atenql/Pand ama.html). Pandanus leaf is cited as an ingredient in many Indian, Thai and Indonesian recipes. Pandanus amaryllifolius is not known to grow in wild state whereas the plants are grown as ornamentals in pots or grown in kitchen gardens in parts of South East Asia Indonesia and New Guinea. The plant produces only 6-8 suckers per year and is known to produce male flowers only in New Guinea. Female flowers are not known in the variety that synthesizes aroma in the leaves (http://www ang.kfunigraz.ac.atengl/Pand_ama.html). Thus the lack of its wild population or the large-scale cultivation on one hand and a high potential for its economic importance on the other hand indicate a huge future demand for this plant material. Thus there could be possibilities of its organized cultivation and hence would be a demand for the planting material. To meet such demands, a<br><br><br>
method for rapid production of plantlets by tissue culture means has tremendous scope. Since the flavor compound in this plant is known to vary in each variety (http://www-ang.kfunigraz.ac.atengl/Pand_ama.html), the plant material with highest perceivable flavor level was selected and a method for rapid multiplication of plantlets was invented.<br>
Plant Tissue Culture (PTC) is a major area of plant biotechnology, which has direct impact on present day agriculture /horticulture. The need for enormous supply of desired type of planting / sowing material may be obtained by applying tissue culture method as an alternative to convenţional method. At present, several laboratories in the world are producing over 650 million plants annually, by applying tissue culture method.<br>
There are various advantages of tissue culture (TC) plants over those produced by convenţional methods of plant propagation. As TC plants are produced in completely controlled environment, the chances of carrying systemic diseases are rare. The plants are induced to multiply at a tremendous rate by developing specific medium formulation for each plant material. Maximum number of plants can be produced using minimum space, time and nutrients. Similarly, storage and transportation can be handled with lesser cost than for convenţional plants. It facilitates the availability of planting material throughout the year.<br>
The present invention relates to a medium formulation for the clonal propagation of scented Pandanus amaryllifolius Roxb. wherein the development of specific nutrient medium with growth regulators help establishment of shoot cultures and rapid further aseptic multiplication of Pandanus shoots which may subsequently be hardened to obtain high quality Pandanus planting material.<br>
There are no reports on the tissue culture studies or clonal propagation of Pandanus amaryllifolius. However there are certain studies on the chemical composition of the plant at different stages of its life cycle.<br><br>
Laksanamai V and llangantilake S. (Cereai Chemistry Voi. 70 (4) 1983) found 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline in Pandanus leaves at levels 1 ppm (on fresh weight basis) and described this aroma as that present in scented rice varieties.<br>
Another flavour, ethyl formamide present in rice as a flavouring compound has been identified in Pandanus leaves (Naturwissenchaften, Voi. 71: 215, 1984). Yet another study found 3-methyl-2- (SH)-furanone as the main volatile compound in Pandanus leaves, besides 3-hexanol, 4-methylpentanol, 3-hexanone and 2-hexanone (Flavour Chemistry of ethnic foods - Proceedings of a Meeting held during the 5th Chemical Congress of North America, Cancun, Nov. 11-15, 1997(1999)).<br>
The drawback associated with the methods followed hitherto for the supply of planting material is that of the convenţional type of propagation involves injury to the mother plant for collecting the lateral shoot suckers which is often associated with the sacrificing of the selected high yielding mother plant. Convenţional method of propagation transmits systemic infection present in the mother plant acquired from one generation to the next leading to diseased planting material. The rate of multiplication is slow.<br>
Objects of the present invention<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a method for the micro-propagation of scented Pandanus amaryllifolius through tissue culture. An object of the present invention is to provide a method for the establishment of aseptic shoot cultures of Pandanus using both terminal and lateral shoot buds as explants and using tissue culture methods.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a method to use suitable tissue culture medium for the micro propagation of scented Pandanus amaryllifolius under controlled propagation conditions.<br>
Still yet another object of the present invention is to provide method for Pandanus plantlet production for the exchange and conservation of disease-free Pandanus germplasm.<br>
It is also an object of the present invention is to provide a composition congenial for the micro-propagation of Pandanus, which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Further object of the present invention is to provide a nutrient composition for the establishment of aseptic shoot cultures of Pandanus using both terminal and lateral shoot buds as explants and using tissue culture methods. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide the most suitable composition as well as growth regulators composition for maximum multiplication of shoot cultures.<br>
Still yet another object of the present invention is to provide the best combination of light and temperature conditions for maximizing the multiplication of the shoot cultures using the proposed culture medium. Further object of the present invention is to provide the nutrient requirements for the development of roots from micro-propagated shoot cultures to facilitate easy establishment of Pandanus plantlets when transferred to soil.<br>

Medium for establishment of aseptic cultures: Shoots from healthy Pandanus plants are collected and the 0.5-1.5 cm long shoot axis with lateral/terminal shoot buds are treated to remove bacterial/fungal (contaminants) by dipping the shoot axis in 0.1% w/v of freshly prepared aqueous mercuric chloride solution for 6 minutes followed by several rinses with sterilised distilled water. The meristems/shoot buds are aseptically removed by cutting with sterile scalpel under laminar flow and cultured on a first nutrient medium, namely Murashige and Skoog's medium. This first culture medium is prepared by dissolving in water the following nutrients:The pH of the medium is adjusted to 5.8 prior to adding gelrite and boiled to homogeneity, dispensed to culture bottles and the screw-capped culture bottles with medium are autoclaved at 121 degree C, 15 Ib/cm2 for 20 minutes. The surface sterilized shoot cuttings are then placed, one at a time using sterile forceps, in a sterile petri-dish in a laminar flow, the shoot tip and small shoot-bud explants are separated from the shoot cuttings with the help of sharp scalpel blades, further appropriately trimmed to obtain small shoot buds of 0.5 ~ 2 millimetre size and placed on sterile medium contained in the culture bottles. The shoot buds placed on the sterile nutrient medium are incubated in dark at 25±2 degree C until tiny shoot cultures are established that may take 4-6 weeks period. In addition to forming tiny shoot buds, there may be a ten-fold multiplication in the number of shoot buds during this treatment. The response of iniţial explants towards the formation of shoot buds and tiny shoots during this treatment may be up to 10%.<br>
The various other levels and combinations of kinetin and benzyl amino purine and other growth regulators such as 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid, indole acetic acid, indole butyric acid, added to the nutrient medium, may result in poor response or lesser percentage of response to form shoot cultures or abnormal callus growth without forming shoots.<br>
The medium without any growth regulator or lesser sucrose levels may not support the establishment of shoot cultures from shoot tip /shoot bud explants.<br>
Example 2<br>
Medium for multiplication of aseptic shoots: The shoot cultures established as in example 1 has to be used as the explant material for the clonal multiplication of Pandanus shoots. The shoot buds established as in Example 1 are removed aseptically in a laminar flow chamber and placed on a sterile petri plate, If there is clustered shoot bud formation, each bud is separated by cutting using sterile scalpel. About three to four shoot buds are then placed on a liquid nutrient medium containing the macro-elements, microelements, vitamins and sucrose of Murashige and Skoog medium (MS, 1962, Physiol. Plantarum 15:473-497) are similar to those in Example 1 with the foilowing nutrients in the second medium is prepared by dissolving in water the foilowing nutrients:<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
The pH of the second medium is adjusted to 5.8 and boiled to homogeneity, dispensed about 40 millilitre to conical flasks and the medium autoclaved at 121 degree C, 15 Ib/cm2for20 minutes.<br>
The shoots are incubated in the second nutrient medium and incubated under a photoperiod of 16h with an illumination of 2000 lux at 25±2 degree C for a period of 30-45 days by which time each shoot forms nearly ten additional shoots. The shoots are then separated aseptically, the larger ones are transferred to a third nutrient medium for shoot elongation as well as rooting as in Example 3, and the smaller ones are transferred to the second medium and grown for a period of 3-6 weeks, the process is repeated to obtain a large number of shoots.<br>
Example 3<br>
Medium for root induction and parţial hardening: The larger shoots of 2 -3cm length multiplied as in Example 2 are transferred to a third medium developed for rooting and parţial hardening containing the following nutrients in water:<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The plantlets were nurtured for 3 weeks at 25 - 30 °C under 2000 lux lllumination where 100% rooting may be encountered which is accompanied by further growth of shoots. The rooted shoots are removed from the container, washed in running ţap water, and then transferred to soil compost containing 1 part of red soil and 2 parts of garden humus, and kept in a place with 90% humidity for another three weeks period. The hardened plantlets may be transferred to green house till they are planted in the field.<br>
The main advantages of the invention<br>
1.	The present invention provides, for the first time, a medium formulation that<br>
efficiently supports shoot bud establishment to form aseptic shoot cultures<br>
of Pandanus amaryllifolius.<br>
2.	The   present   invention   also   provides   an   efficient   process   for   shoot<br>
multiplication allowing 10-fold increase in the shoot number in 4 weeks<br>
period, which is a high rate of multiplication using tissue culture technology.<br>
3.	The process of the present invention involves a nutrient medium formulation<br>
for continuous multiplication of Pandanus plants throughout the year.<br>
4 The process of the present invention allows producing Pandanus amaryllifolius planting material free from saprophytic, fungal and bacterial diseases.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
