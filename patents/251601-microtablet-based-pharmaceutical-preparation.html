COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See section 10, Rule 13]<br>
MICROTABLET-BASED	PHARMACEUTICAL<br>
PREPARATION;<br><br><br>
BIOGENERICS	PHARMA	GMBH,	/CORPORATION ORGANIZED AND EXISTINQ UNDER THE LAWS OF THE GERMANY WHOS^ ADDRESS IS LOOGESTIEG 7, D-2024^ HAMBURG, GERMANY.<br><br>
THE	FOLLOWING	SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br><br>
The invention relates to a novel pharmaceutical preparation which comprises various microtablets with different constituents, the microtablets having the same spatial shape and the same weight.<br>
Microtablets are known, for example, from DE 342 26 19 A1. The specification describes cylindrical shaped bodies having a convex upper side and under¬side, the cylinder diameter and height of which are independently of one another in the range of from 1.0 to 2.5 mm and are in a ratio to one another of 1 : 0.5 to 1.5.<br>
It is known to administer various active compounds pharmaceutically with the aid of microtablets, examples being pantoprazole (DE 696 261 16 T 2), analgesics (DE 199 016 83 B4), alkyi hydrogen fumarates and omeprazole (DE 196 260 45 C2).<br>
The problems of pharmaceutical administration of active compounds are described in WO 00/67695. According to this publication, microtablets are conventionally administered in capsules. A disadvantage here for the patient is the difficult and troublesome individual dosing (WO 00/67695, page 1, lines 19 to 21). The document also states that the use of hard gelatin capsules does not solve this problem, since these capsules cannot be swallowed or can be swallowed only with difficulty by patients (WO 00/67695, page 1, lines 22 to 26). Reliable individual dosing is not possible in practice by removing and dividing up the capsule contents, since the contents of one or more capsules would have to be divided up into the required amount. However, this cannot be done by a patient, or can be done only with great effort (WO 00/67695, page 1, lines 33 to 37).<br>
2<br><br>
EP 1 185 253 B1 describes ora! administration units with the active compounds tramadol and diclofenac. The two active compounds are contained in the administration unit in subunits each formulated separately [0007].<br>
The subunits in the context of EP 1 185 253 B1 are solid medicament formulations which comprise, in addition to the particular active compound and/or its particular physiologically acceptable salts, the conventional auxiliary additives [0010].<br>
The subunits in the context of EP 1 185 253 B1 can be in multiparticulate form, for example as microtabiets [0011].<br>
The oral administration unit described in EP 1 185 253 B1 can be in the form of a sachet, a capsule or a tablet [0023],<br>
The object of the present invention is a novel pharmaceutical preparation with which microtabiets can be adjusted according to the requirements of the patient and can easily be administered by the patient.<br>
A pharmaceutical preparation based on microtabiets has been found, characterized in that the pharmaceutical preparation contains various microtabiets with different constituents, each microtablet having the same spatial shape and the same weight.<br>
All the microtabiets for the pharmaceutical preparations according to the invention have the same density and as a result; can be easily dosed and combined to give individual preparations.<br>
The preparations according to the invention are preferably in a flowabie form. Due to the various microtabiets having the same density, no separation of the vanous microtabiets occurs, so that they can be dosed in a similar manner to a liquid.<br>
3<br><br>
The preparations according to the invention can easily be administered by the patient.<br>
in a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the microtablets are present in. the pharmaceutical preparation-according to the invention in a homogeneous mixture.<br>
The constituents are largely uniformly distributed in the pharmaceutical preparations according to the invention. As a result of the individual . microtablets having the same density, the uniform distribution of the constituents remains constant; no separation of the microtablets in the preparation according to the invention due to a different density can occur.<br>
The constituents of the microtablets can be active compounds, further auxiliary substances and fillers.<br>
in the context of the present invention, different active compounds or active compound combinations are distributed over different microtablets. By this means it is easily possible to vary the active compound content in the individual preparations and to adapt it to the individual requirements of the individual patient.<br>
In this manner, it is possible according to the invention for the preparations ' easily to be composed individually from microtablets as "units' for exarhple according to the doctor's instructions, and to be brought to.a form :which is easy to administer. The preparation can also be composed, forexample,'in the: pharmacy using the conventional means available there<br>
JO	It is of course also possible in the context of the present invention to provide<br>
individualized standard preparations.<br>
4<br><br>
The preparations according to the invention are most easily provided by weighing the individual types of micrctabiets for a preparation.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations according to the invention can be administered easily via a dosing spoon, since due to the uniform distribution of the microtablets, the constituents are also distributed uniformly. It is therefore not necessary to pack the microtablets into capsules.<br>
Possible active compounds for the microtablets are in principle all solid active compounds which can be processed into microtablets.<br>
The active compounds in the context of the present invention include, for example, pharmaceuticals, homoeopathically acting substances, vitamins, minerals, probiotic active compounds, enzymes, food supplements and plant extracts which are known per se.<br>
The following active compounds may be mentioned by way of example:<br>

The microtablets of a preparation in the context of the present invention must all have the same weight and the same spatial shape. The weight is adjusted according to the choice of active compounds by varying the fillers.<br>
In the case of other preparations, microtablets having a different weight and another spatial shape can of course be employed.<br>
The weight of an individual microtablet depends on the composition and, where appropriate, on the coating. By changing the contents of the auxiliary substances and fillers, microtablets which have different active compounds and the same weight can be achieved.<br>
The surface of the microtablets can be coated in a manner known per se. By this means, for example, administration can be facilitated or the active compound can be protected (e.g. from gastric acid).<br>
8<br><br>
The spatial shape of the microtablets can in principle be chosen as desired. However, the spatial shape should be such that there is no hindrance from the individual microtablets during homogenization.<br>
The microtablets in the context of the present invention preferably have a cylindrical, elliptical or spherical spatial shape.<br>
The size of the microtablets in cylindrical shape in the context of the present invention can in general have a height and a diameter of from in each case about 1 to about 4 mm, preferably from 1 to 2.5 mm. -.<br>
For example, a microtablet in a cylindrical shape with a height and a diameter of about 2 mm each can have a weight of from 6.5 to 8.5 mg.<br>
The microtablets in the context of the preparations according to the invention   " are very accurately worked and allow only very minor deviations in the context of international pharmacopoeias.<br>
The preparation of the microtablets in the context of the preparations according to the invention is known per se.<br>
The homogenization (i.e. the uniform distribution) of the microtablets .in a preparation according to the invention can.be carried out by processes known per se. The microtablets are not destroyed,during this. -<br>
A process has also been found for the preparation-of pharmaceutical preparations based on microtablets with different constituents, which is characterized in that microtablets having the same spatial shape and the same weight are mixed homogeneously.<br>
The preparations prepared according to the invention can be stored in a bottle : in a stable manner for a long period of time, and during the administration can <br>
9<br><br>
be filled from the bottle into a measuring vessel. The composition of the recipe and the fiowability are retained here.<br>
The present invention also provides the use of the preparations according to the invention which contain various microtabiets with different constituents, each microtablet having the same spatial shape and the same weight, forr:. treatment and prevention of diseases.<br>
The preparations according to the invention can be easily prepared in an advantageous manner and easily administered in an individualized form. They extend in a novel manner the administration possibilities of agents for treatment and prevention of diseases.<br>
Example:<br>
Preparation for a diabetic for treatment of the disease symptoms. There are the following four types<br>
Bio - fruits n Greens 2,000 mg per day x 30 days = 60 grams - antioxidants Bio-Glucoban 350 mg per day x 30 = 10.5 grams - combination of 4 extracts<br>
(Mormodica charantia, Legerstroemia speciosa, Centella asiatica and ;<br>
alpha-fipoic acid), which as phytoinsulin have the effect of improving the<br>
circulation for better transportation of glucose into the cells and for<br>
reducing insulin resistance. Bio-Eye Health 250 mg perday.x30 = 7.5 grams -combination of carotenoids;<br>
lutein, astan'xathin, if vision is already impaired. Bio-CardioHealth - 500 mg per=da'y.x30 =:15grams&gt; combination of natural<br>
tocotrienols and tocopherols:(fulI spectrum vitamin E), natural vitamin C<br>
and coenzyme Q10.<br>
Each microtablet has 5 mg as the active substance and has a weight of 7.5 mg incl. the additives.<br>
10<br><br>
The dosages depend on the weight and ctinicil picture of the patient.<br>
The microtablets are cylindrical and have a height of 2 mm and a diameter of 2<br>
mm.<br>
According to the predetermined dosage, the four different types of microtablets are homogenized in a shaking beaker and can be removed with a measuring vessel, The preparation is readily fiowable.<br>
