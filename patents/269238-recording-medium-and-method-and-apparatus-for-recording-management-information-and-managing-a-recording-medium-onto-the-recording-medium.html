WRITE-ONCE OPTICAL DISC AND METHOD FOR RECORDING<br>
MANAGEMENT INFORMATION THEREON<br>
	Technical Field<br>
5	The present invention relates to a write-once optical disc, a method for<br>
	recoding management information on the write-once optical disc. and a<br>
	recording/playback apparatus using the method.<br>
	Background Art<br>
10	As an optical recording medium, optical discs on which high-capacity data<br>
	can be recorded are widely being used. Among them, a new high-density<br>
	optical recording medium (HD-DVD), for example, a Blu-ray disc, has been<br>
	recently developed for recording and storing high-definition video data and<br>
	high-quality audio data for a long term period.<br>
15	The Blu-ray disc is the next generation HD-DVD technology and the next<br>
	generation optical recording solution, and has an excellent capability to<br>
	store data more than the existing DVDs. Recently, a technical specification<br>
	of international standard for HD-DVD has been established. Related with<br>
	this, various standards tor a write-once Blu-ray disc (BD-WO) are being<br>
20	prepared following the standards for a rewritable Blu-ray disc (BD-RE).<br>
	Among the standards for the write-once Blu-ray disc (BD-WO), a method for<br><br>
2<br>
	recording management information has been discussed. This method<br>
	involves a recording method of an information indicating a recorded status<br>
	of the disc, which is one of the characteristics of the write-once optical disc.<br>
	The information indicating the recorded status of the disc allows a host or a<br>
5	user to easily find a recordable area on the write-once optical disc. In the<br>
	existing write-once optical discs, this information is namedly variously. For<br>
	example, in the case of CD series, this information is named a track<br>
	information; in the case of DVD series, this information is named an RZone<br>
	or a fragment.<br>
10	Accordingly, there is an increasing demand for a method of efficiently<br>
	recording the management information corresponding to the recorded status<br>
	of the high-density optical disc. And this method must be provided with the<br>
	standardised information in order to secure mutual compatibility. In<br>
	addition, there is a demand for a method of recording the management<br>
15	information on a disc, which can be applied to a write-once high-density<br>
	optical disc performing defect management, as well as to the Blu-ray discs.<br>
	Disclosure of Invention<br>
	Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a write-once optical disc<br>
20	and a method for managing the disc that substantially obviate one or more<br>
	problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.<br><br>
3<br>
	An object of the present invention is to provide a method and apparatus for<br>
	recording management information of a write-once optical disc, which are<br>
	capable of recording and managing the disc recorded status information<br>
	more efficiently.<br>
5	Another object of the present invention is to define different types of<br>
	sequential recording ranges (SRRs) and to provide a method and apparatus<br>
	for recording the SRRs on SRR information (SRRI).<br>
	Another object of the present invention is to provide a structure of a write-<br>
	oncc optical disc and a structure of SRRIs that facilitate the<br>
10	recording/playback operations of the disc.<br>
	A further object of the present invention is to provide a method of recording<br>
	SRRI, a method of recovering SRRI, and a recording/playback apparatus,<br>
	which can be applied to a write-once optical disc.<br>
	Additional advantages, objects, and features of the invention will be set forth<br>
15	in part in the description which follows and in part will become apparent to<br>
	those having ordinary skill in the art upon examination of the following or<br>
	may be learned from practice of the invention. The objectives and other<br>
	advantages of the invention may be realized and attained by the structure(s)<br>
	particularly pointed out in the written description and claims hereof as well<br>
20	as the appended drawings.<br>

	Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
20	Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the<br>
	present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying<br><br>
6<br>
	drawings. "Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used<br>
	throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.<br>
	According to the present invention, a plurality of regions are formed on an<br>
	optical disc such as a BD-WO and each of these regions is referred to as a<br>
5	"sequential recording range" (SRR). A recording/playback operation is<br>
	performed on/from these regions. Information indicating the recorded<br>
	status of the disc will be referred to as "sequential recording range<br>
	information" (SRRI), meaning it is applied to a sequential recording mode of<br>
	the disc. The SRRI pertains to one or more SRRs.<br>
10	FIG. 1 illustrates a structure of a write-once optical disc such as a BD-WO<br>
	and a method for recording disc management information according to the<br>
	present invention. The disc shown in FIG. 1 has a single recording layer as<br>
	an example. But the present invention is not limited to such, and is<br>
	applicable to a disc having dual or multiple recording layers.<br>
15	Referring to FIG. 1, the disc includes a lead-in area, a data area, and a lead-<br>
	out area, all at the recording layer. The lead-in and lead-out areas have a<br>
	plurality of disc (or defect) management areas (DMA1 - DMA4) for storing<br>
	the same defect management information repeatedly. In the data area, an<br>
	inner spare area ISAO and/or an outer spare area OSAO for replacing<br>
20	defective areas is provided.<br>
	It is known that a rewritable optical disc does not have or need a large DMA<br><br>
7<br>
	since its DMA can be written and erased repeatedly, even if the disc has the<br>
	DMA of a limited size. This is not the case for a write-once optical disc such<br>
	as a BD-WO. Since the write-once optical disc cannot be re-recorded on the<br>
	area that was recorded once, the write-once optical disc needs and has a<br>
5	larger management area. To more effectively store management information,<br>
	in the write-once optical disc the management information is temporarily<br>
	stored in a temporary disc management area (TDMA). When the disc is<br>
	ready to be finalized/closed, then the management information stored in a<br>
	final/latest TDMA is transferred to a DMA for more permanent storage.<br>
10	As shown in FIG. 1, the disc includes two TDMAs: TDMAO and TDMA1. The<br>
	TDMAO is allocated to the lead-in area and has a fixed, non-variable size.<br>
	The TDMAI is allocated to the outer spare area OSAO and has a size variable<br>
	in accordance with the size or the spare area. The size P of the TDMA1 may<br>
	be, for example, P = (N * 256) / 4 clusters where N is a positive integer,<br>
15	which is about one fourth of the size of the entire outer spare area OSAO.<br>
	In each of the TDMAO and TDMAI, temporary defect list (TDFL) information<br>
	and temporary disc definition structure (TDDS) information together (TDFL<br>
	+ TDDS) can be recorded in one recording-unit (e.g., one cluster in the case<br>
	of a BD-WO), or SRRI and TDDS information together (SRRI + TDDS) can be<br>
20	recorded in one recording-unit as shown. The SRRI is recorded when a<br>
	sequential recording mode is used, whereas SBM (space bit map) is used<br><br>
8<br>
	when a random recording mode is used.<br>
	At each update time, (TDFL + TDDS) or (SRRI + TDDS) are recorded to the<br>
	TDMA in the size of one cluster. In the example of FIG. 1, a TDFL and a<br>
	TDDS are recorded in one cluster of the TDMAO, an SRRI and a TDDS are<br>
5	recorded in the next cluster of the TDMAO, an SRRI and a TDDS are<br>
	recorded in the next cluster of the TDMAO, and so on.<br>
	If a defective area occurs within the data area, a process of replacing it with<br>
	the spare area is carried out. The TDFL is the information that manages this<br>
	process as the defect list. In the case of a single layer disc, the TDFL is<br>
10	recorded with the size of 1 cluster to 4 clusters according to the size of the<br>
	delect list. Disc status information indicates whether a specific area of the<br>
	disc is recorded or not-recorded. Specially, it can be usefully applied to<br>
	the case where the disc is recorded in a sequential or incremental recording<br>
	mode. In addition, the TDDS information is generally recorded on the last<br>
15	sector among the 32 sectors within one cluster of the management area<br>
	important information for general management and defect management of<br>
	the disc is recorded as part of the TDDS information, and the TODS<br>
	information is generally always recorded last when the management<br>
	information is updated within the TDMA.<br>
20	The present invention provides a method of recording a recorded status<br>
	information of a disc in a new high-density optical disc such as a BD-WO.<br><br>
9<br>
	Specifically, SRRI is used as the recorded status information that indicates<br>
	the recorded status of the disc. Each SRRI pertains to one or more SRRs<br>
	(recording regions) on the disc. The present invention defines various types<br>
	of SRRs, which will be discussed later referring to FIGs. 2A to 3E. The<br>
5	structure of the SRRI according to the present invention will be now<br>
	described with reference to FIG. 1.<br>
	As shown in FIG. 1, each SRRI 60 in the TDMA(s) generally includes three<br>
	parts, a header 50 for identifying the corresponding SRRI, a list of SRR<br>
	entries (SRR entry list) 30 including SRR type information, and an SRR list<br>
10	terminator 40 for indicating the termination of the corresponding SRRI.<br>
	The SRRI header 50 is located at the head of the corresponding SRRI 60 and<br>
	includes an "SRRI structure identifier" field 51 for making the SRRI<br>
	identifiable, a "List of opened SRRs" field 52 for identifying the location of<br>
	each opened SRR pertaining to the current SRRI, a "Number of SRR entries"<br>
15	field 53 for identifying the total number of SRRs, and a "Number of opened<br>
	SRRs" field 54 for identifying the total number of opened SRRs. The "List of<br>
	opened SRRs' field 52 stores SRR numbers (identifications) of the opened<br>
	SRRs.<br>
	By accessing the SRRI header 50, the general contents of the entire SRRI 60<br>
20	can be known without having to access the SRR entry list 30 directly. It is<br>
	possible to newly deline any new SRR types or other necessary information<br><br>
10<br>
	and to insert this information into the header 50 as needed.<br>
	The SRR entry list ("Lisr oi SRR entries") 30 is recorded alter the SRR]<br>
	header 50. When the SRR entry list 30 is terminated, the termination of the<br>
	SRR entry list 30 is identified with the SRR list terminator ("SRR List<br>
5	Terminator") 40. Specifically, the SRR list terminator 40 is information<br>
	identifying the termination of the corresponding SRRI when the SRRI has a<br>
	variable size.<br>
	The SRR entry list 30 is a list in which a plurality of SRR entries 35 are<br>
	collected. Eight (8) bytes (or 64 bits) are allocated to each SRR entry 35, and<br>
10	one SRR entry 35 represents information on one SRR on the disc. Each SRR<br>
	entry 35 includes an SRR status field 31, a start address field 32 for storing<br>
	a start address of the corresponding SRR, a reserved area 33, and a last<br>
	recorded address (LRA) field 34 for storing the LRA of the corresponding SRR.<br>
	According to an embodiment, the first 4 most significant bits (b63-b60)<br>
15	among the 64 bits of the SRR entry 35 are allocated to the SRR status field<br>
	31, the next 28 bits (b59-b32) of the SRR entry 35 are allocated to the start<br>
	address field 32, the next 4 bits (b31-b28) of the SRR entry 30 are allocated<br>
	to the reserved area 33, and the last 28 bits(b27-b0) of the SRR entry 35 are<br>
	allocated to the LRA field 34.<br>
20	Accordingly, as the management information of the disc, the SRRI includes<br>
	the header, the list of SRR entries and the SRR list terminator, and all such<br><br>
11<br>
	information is recorded collectively at each updating instance.<br>
	One of the objects of the present invention is to define and distinguish<br>
	various types of SRRs formed within the disc and to use them to<br>
	record /playback to/from the disc. Therefore, according to the present<br>
5	invention, the types of the SRRs will be defined and the method of recording<br>
	an information that distinguishes the types of the SRRs within the SRRI will<br>
	be described now in detail.<br>
	Particularly, an SRR is an area reserved for recording data or information on<br>
	a write-once oplical disc such as a BD-WO. The present invention defines<br>
10	the types of the SRRs according to necessity and/or a recording progress.<br>
	The detailed description of various SRR types that are defined by the present<br>
	invention, is provided as follows referring to FIGs. 2A-3E.<br>
	FIGs. 2A to 2D illustrate different types of opened SRRs for the write-once<br>
	optical disc (e.g., a BD-WO) according to the present invention. An opened<br>
15	SRR means an SRR that can be recordable on the corresponding area.<br>
	"Recordable" means that the SRR has a next writable address (NWA).<br>
	Accordingly, the opened SRR is an SRR with an NWA. An unrecordable SRR<br>
	without NWA is a closed SRR. That is, the closed SRR is an SRR that<br>
	cannot be recordable or has no NWA. The closed SRR types will be<br>
20	described later referring to FIGs. 3A to 3E.<br>
	More specifically, FIG. 2A illustrates an invisible SRR among the opened<br><br>
12<br>
	SRRs. The invisible SRR is generally always formed at the outermost section<br>
	of the disc or to the initial blank disc and means a non-recorded region. In<br>
	other words, the invisible SRR has only a start address but has no end to its<br>
	area. Since recording is not performed in the invisible SRR, its LRA is zero.<br>
5	The NWA of the invisible SRR becomes the same value as its start address.<br>
	FIG. 2B illustrates an incomplete SRR among the opened SRRs. The<br>
	incomplete SRR is an SRR in which recording is performed to some portion<br>
	of the SRR white the SRR is in the invisible SRR status. In other words, the<br>
	incomplete SRR has only a start address but has no end to its area. Since<br>
10	the recording is performed to some portion of the SRR, the LRA of the<br>
	incomplete SRR is a last recorded area on which normal data is recorded.<br>
	Therefore, the NWA of the incomplete SRR is an address next to (or<br>
	following) the LRA of the SRR.<br>
	FIG. 2C illustrates an empty SRR amomg the opened SRRs. Unlike the<br>
15	invisible SRR and the incomplete SRR of FIGs. 2A and 2B, the empty SRR is<br>
	an SRR that is generally formed at an intermediate area of the disc, not at<br>
	the outermost area of the disc, for recording. In other words, it is a case<br>
	where the recording is not yet performed after the opened SRR is formed for<br>
	a host or user's recording. The empty SRR has both a start addiess and an<br>
20	end address. However, since the empty SRR indicates the pre-recording<br>
	state, the LRA is zero and the NWA has the same value as the start address<br><br>
13<br>
	of the SRR.<br>
	FIG. 2D illustrates a partially recorded SRR among the opened SRRs. The<br>
	partially recorded SRR is an SRR in which recording is performed to some<br>
	portion of the SRR while the SRR is in the empty SRR status shown in FIG.<br>
5	2C. Therefore, the partially recorded SRR has both a start address and an<br>
	end address. Since the recording is performed to some portion of the SRR,<br>
	the LRA of the partially recorded SRR is a last recorded area address and<br>
	the NWA is an address next to the LRA.<br>
	According to an embodiment of the present invention, the number of opened<br>
10	SRRs that is allowed is advantageously limited to a predetermined number,<br>
	since it is difficult to manage a large number of opened SRRs on the write-<br>
	once optical disc. For example, in the case of BD-WOs, the total number of<br>
	opened SRRs that is allowed at a given time is maximum sixteen.<br>
	Information on the location and number of opened SRRs within the disc can<br>
15	be obtained by checking the "List of opened SRRs" field 52 and the "Number<br>
	of opened SRRs" field 54 within the SRRI header 50 of FIG. 1.<br>
	FlGs. 3A to 3E illustrate different types of closed SRRs for a write-once<br>
	optical disc such as a BD-WO according to the present invention. A closed<br>
	SRR is an SRR that is non-recordable and "non-recordable" means that the<br>
20	SRR has no NWA. Therefore, the closed SRR can be formed by completing<br>
	the recording of the SRR. Even if a recordable area remains in the SRR, the<br><br>
14<br>
	SRR may be forcibly closed by a user/host's close command.<br>
	More specifically, FIG. 3A illustrates an empty SRR among the closed SRRs.<br>
	The empty SRR is an SRR that is closed by a close command with no<br>
	recording to the SRR when the SRR is in the empty SRR state shown in FIG.<br>
5	2C. In this regard, FIG. 3A is an example of a dosed empty SRR and FIG.<br>
	2C is an example of an opened empty SRR.<br>
	FIG. 38 illustrates a partially recorded SRR among the closed SRRs. The<br>
	partially recorded SRR is an SRR that is closed by a close command with no<br>
	additional recording to the SRR when the SRR is in the partially recorded<br>
10	SRR state shown in FIG. 2D. In this regard, FIG. 3B is a closed partially<br>
	recorded SRR and FIG. 2D is an opened partially recorded SRR.<br>
	FIG. 3C illustrates a complete SRR among the closed SRRs. The complete<br>
	SRR is an SRR in which a normal user data recording is completed to the<br>
	and of the SRR. The complete SRR exists only among the closed SRRs.<br>
15	FIG. 3D illustrates another example of a closed partially recorded SRR<br>
	among the closed SRRs. This SRR type invokes an SRR that is closed after<br>
	some recordable area (after the LRA) of the SRR is padded with specific<br>
	dummy data when closing the opened partially recorded SRR of FIG. 2D,<br>
	The entire area or some area of the recordable area of the SRR can be<br>
20	padded with the dummy data. As a variation, specific character code (ASCII<br>
	characteristic) instead of the dummy data can be used to pad the SRR. The<br><br>
15<br>
	padding data can be used to indicate that the SRR is closed. In one example,<br>
	the specific character as the padding data may be "CLSD" indicating that<br>
	the corresponding SRR is closed. In another example, dummy data of zero<br>
	can be used such that if an SRR with such dummy data is detected, this<br>
5	SRR can be determined to be a closed SRR. When padding the opened SRR<br>
	to close it, at least part of the recordable area of the SRR may be recorded<br>
	with the padding data. This part of the SRR may be at least one recording-<br>
	unit such as one cluster, and can be the first cluster after the LRA. That is,<br>
	at least one recording-unit of the opened SRR starting from its NWA can be<br>
10	padded when closing the opened SRR.<br>
	FIG. 3E illustrates another example of a closed empty SRR among the closed<br>
	SRRs. This SRR type involves an SRR that is closed after some recordable<br>
	area of the SRR is padded with padding data when closing the opened empty<br>
	SRR of FIG. 2C. The padding operation in FIG. 3D as discussed above is<br>
15	applied herein.<br>
	As shown in FIGs. 3A-3B and 3D-3E, when an opened SRR is changed into<br>
	a closed SRR by a close command, the case that the non-recorded area is<br>
	closed without padding (FIGs. 3A and 3B) and the case that the non-<br>
	recorded area is closed with padding (FIGs. 3D and 3E) are defined<br>
20	differently.<br>
	Also, the case that the SRR is closed without padding and the case that the<br><br>
16<br>
	SRR is closed after padding it with specific padding data, can be selectively<br>
	accomplished. In the case of existing Blu-ray discs, the non-recorded area<br>
	is compatible with the playback-only disc even without padding. The<br>
	recording/playback apparatus (FIG. 14) can selectively perform the padding<br>
5	operation, thereby securing the degree of freedom in the structure/operation<br>
	of the recording/playback apparatus effectively. Further, in the padding<br>
	operation, a recording/playback part (e.g., the component 10 in FIG. 14) of<br>
	the recording/playback apparatus can prestore the padding data and<br>
	automatically record it an SRR as needed. This reduces the padding<br>
10	operating time, compared to when a controller transmit the padding data<br>
	and the padding occurs thereafter.<br>
	Further, if a portion (e.g., a first cluster after the LRA) of the recordable area<br>
	within the SRR is padded with specific data in the closing of the SRR, it is<br>
	possible to validly restore the current disc status even when a loss of the<br>
15	SRRI is present. A detailed description about this feature of the invention<br>
	will be made later with reference to FIGs. 7A to 13B.<br>
	FIGs. 4A to 4G illustrate an example of a process of forming SRRs within the<br>
	disc of FIGs. 1-3E according to an embodiment of the present invention. In<br>
	these and other figures, a portion indicated by a thick arrow represents a<br>
20	NWA location. Herein, different types of sessions will be defined and<br>
	described together according to the present invention.<br><br>
17<br>
	A "session" is an upper-level recording-unit compared to the lower-level<br>
	recording-unit such as an SRR, and includes at least one SRR. Also, since<br>
	only one recordable session may be present within the disc at a given time, a<br>
	new session must be allocated after all previously allocated sessions are<br>
5	closed. Accordingly, in case a session is closed, all SRRs existing within<br>
	that session must be closed together. Also, each SRR can be closed by<br>
	padding the entire area or some area of the recordable area within the SRR.<br>
	or can be closed without padding the recordable area of the SRR, as<br>
	discussed above. This operation can be selectively performed by the optical<br>
10	rccording/playback apparatus.<br>
	Sessions can be classified into different types; an empty session having only<br>
	an invisible SRR; an incomplete session having at least one opened SRR<br>
	except for an invisible SRR; and a complete session having only one or more<br>
	closed SRRs.<br>
15	Particularly, FIG. 4A illustrates an initial blank disc that is in a recordable<br>
	status all over the entire area. A start location of the disc becomes the NWA.<br>
	In such a state, only one SRR is present on the disc. This is the same as the<br>
	invisible SRR shown in FIG. 2A. Therefore, the session here has a disc<br>
	initial status in which only one empty session is present.<br>
20	FIG. 4B illustrate a case when some portion of the blank disc of FIG. 4A is<br>
	recorded or the session of FIG. 4A is not closed. In such a state, only one<br><br>
18<br>
	SRR is present on the disc. This is the same as the incomplete SRR shown<br>
	in FIG. 28. Therefore, the session here is in a status where only one<br>
	incomplete session is present.<br>
	FIG. 4C illustrates a case when a session close command is executed when<br>
5	the disc is in the state of FIG. 4B. At this time, the existing data recorded<br>
	area is separated into an independent closed SRR by the session close<br>
	command and a new (empty) session is created. In other words, the entire<br>
	recorded area in FIG. 4B becomes a complete SRR #1 which in turn<br>
	constitutes a complete session #1. The non-recorded area then becomes an<br>
10	invisible SRR (shown in FIG. 2A) which in turn constitutes an empty session.<br>
	FIG. 4D illustrates a case when two opened SRRs are reserved in the empty<br>
	session of FIG. 4C. Each new reserved opened SRR becomes the empty SRR<br>
	and has a NWA. The remaining area of the empty session forms an invisible<br>
	SRR. As a result, the empty session of FIG. 4C changes to an incomplete<br>
15	session.<br>
	FIG. 4E illustrates a case when data is recorded in the first empty SRR and<br>
	the invisible SRR of FIG. 4D. Due to the recording, the first empty SRR<br>
	changes to an opened partially recorded SRR and the invisible SRR changes<br>
	to an incomplete SRR.<br>
20	FIG. 4F illustrates a case when a session close command is executed from<br>
	the state of FIG. 4E, but non-recorded area(s) of the session is closed<br><br>
19<br>
	without padding. When closing the session, all SRRs contained in that<br>
	session must be closed. For instance, the existing data recorded area of the<br>
	incomplete session of FIG. 4E becomes an independent complete session<br>
	(complete session #2) by the session close command. All SRRs contained in<br>
5	the complete session #2 change to closed SRRs to form a closed partially<br>
	recorded SRR #2, a closed empty SRR #3 and a complete SRR #4. The<br>
	remaining outermost SRR becomes an invisible SRR #5 as an opened SRR,<br>
	and a newly reserved empty session #3 having the invisible SRR #5 is<br>
	created.<br>
10	FIG. 4G illustrates another case when a session close command is executed<br>
	from the state of FIG. 4E, but non-recorded area(s) of the session is closed<br>
	with padding. That is, the present process can proceed from the stale of FIG.<br>
	4E to the state of either FIG. 4F or 4G. Referring to FIG. 4G, the existing<br>
	data recorded area of the incomplete session or FIG. 4E becomes an<br>
15	independent complete session #2 by the session close command. After some<br>
	or all of the remaining areas of the complete session #2 are padded with<br>
	dummy data or specific character data as discussed above, all SRRs<br>
	contained in the complete session #2 change to closed SRRs. As a result of<br>
	the padding, three types of closed SRSs are reserved within the complete<br>
20	session #2. They are a closed SRR #2 that is changed from the opened<br>
	partially recorded SRR to the closed SRR after the padding; a closed SRR #3<br><br>
20<br>
	that is changed from the opened empty SRR to the closed SRR after the<br>
	padding; and a complete SRR #4 that is changed to the closed SRR since the<br>
	physical user data is normally recorded. Although FIG. 4G shows that the<br>
	entire recordable areas are padded in the closing of the SRRs, the present<br>
5	invention covers a scenario where only a portion (e.g., a first part or cluster<br>
	after the LRA) of an SRR may be padded.<br>
	According to the present invention, when the SRRs are closed, different<br>
	types of SRRa may be created depending on whether or not a padding<br>
	operation is performed to the SRRs as shown in FIG. 4F or 4G. Therefore,<br>
10	there is need for a method of recording new SRR information, which can<br>
	distinguish the defined types of SRRs in order to correctly indicate the<br>
	recorded status of the disc.<br>
	Hereinafter, a method for identifying the type of an SRR will be described.<br>
	For the convenience of explanation, this method as applied to the SRR entry<br>
15	within the SRRI of FIG. 1 will be described. The SRR type identification<br>
	according to the present invention is performed according to the padding of<br>
	the closed SRR, and it is apparent that various modifications and variations<br>
	can be made in the present invention.<br>
	FIG. 5A illustrates a first embodiment of the SRR entry according to the<br>
20	present invention. The SRR entry structure of FIG. 5A is applied to each<br>
	SRR entry 35 of FIG. 1, but can be applied to any other SRR entry of a disc.<br><br>
21<br>
	As shown, the SRR entry 35 includes a SRR status field 31, a start address<br>
	field 32, a reserved area 33 and an LRA field 34 as discussed above. The<br>
	SRR status field 31 carries therein 4-bit SRR status information used to<br>
	distinguish whether the corresponding SRR is closed with padding or<br>
5	without padding.<br>
	Particularly, 1 bit (31a) of the 4-bit SRR status information in the SRR<br>
	status field 31 is used as a padding flag (hereinafter, referred to as a "P-flag")<br>
	for identifying whether or not the padding is performed to the corresponding<br>
	SRR, and the other 3 bits (31b) of the SRR status field 31 are a reserved<br>
10	area for coping with future modifications in the standard as needed. In the<br>
	example, the first bit (b63) of the SRR status field 31 carries the P-flag and<br>
	the remaining three bits (b62-b60) of the SRR status field 31 function as the<br>
	reserved area. However, other variations are possible.<br>
	In the example, if the P-flag has a value of "lb", it means that the<br>
15	corresponding SRR is a closed SRR in which the padding has been<br>
	performed. If the P-flag has a value of "Ob", it means that the corresponding<br>
	SRR is an SRR in which no padding has been performed. Other values may<br>
	be used in the P-flag. Accordingly, if the P-flag has the value "Ob", the<br>
	corresponding SRR can be an opened SRR or a closed SRR. However, if the<br>
20	corresponding SRR is an SRR that is registered in the "List of opened SRRs"<br>
	field 52 within the SRRI header 50, it means it is an opened SRR, but if it is<br><br>
22<br>
	not registered, then it means it is a closed SRR.<br>
	In the start address field 32 of the SRR entry 35, the address corresponding<br>
	to the start location of the corresponding SRR is recorded. Generally, it is<br>
	represented with a physical sector number (PSN). The reserved area/field<br>
5	33 of the SRR entry 35 is provided for future modifications in the standard<br>
	as needed.<br>
	The LRA field 34 of the SRR entry 35 provides an LRA information of the<br>
	corresponding SRR. That is, an information on the end address of the<br>
	actually recorded user data (except for the padding data) of the<br>
10	corresponding SRR is recorded. In other words, in the case of a complete<br>
	SRR, the end addresses of the LRA and the SRR accord with each other.<br>
	However, in the case of a partially recorded SRR, the end addresses of the<br>
	LRA and the SRR do not accord with each other. An LRA is an address of an<br>
	area where the physical user data are recorded. Even if specific padding<br>
15	data, are recorded in the SRR by the padding operation, the LRA value of the<br>
	SRR is not changed. Also, in the case of an empty SRR, the LRA of the SRR<br>
	becomes zero because there is no ares where the physical user data are<br>
	recorded.<br>
	FIGs. 5B and 5C illustrate two different examples of recording the P-flag of<br>
20	FIG. 5A based on the method of creating the SRR entry according to the first<br>
	embodiment of the present invention. For the convenience of explanation,<br><br>
23<br>
	PIG. 5B illustrates the case of FIG. 4F in which no padding is performed in<br>
	the closing of the SRR(s). and FIG. 5C illustrates the case of FIG. 4G in<br>
	which padding is performed in the closing of the SRR(s).<br>
	Referring to FIG. SB, in this example, SRR numbers #1 to #5 are given to<br>
5	five SRRs in sequence, respectively. The SRR #1 is a complete SRR without<br>
	padding, which is indicated in the corresponding SRR entry by the P-flag of<br>
	"Ob". The SRR #2 is a closed partially recorded SRR without padding, which<br>
	is indicated in the corresponding SRR entry by the P-flag of "Ob". The SRR<br>
	#3 is a closed empty SRR without padding, which is indicated in the<br>
10	corresponding SRR entry by the P-flag of "Ob". The SRR #4 is a complete<br>
	SRR without padding, which is indicated in the corresponding SRR entry by<br>
	the P-flag of "Ob". The SRR #5 is an invisible SRR without padding, which is<br>
	indicated in the corresponding SRS entry by the P-flag of "Ob".<br>
	In the case of FIG. 5B, all SRRs have no padding as indicated by the P-flags<br>
15	of "Ob". The opened SRR is only the SRR #5 (invisible SRR). Therefore, only<br>
	the SRR #5 is recorded in the "List of opened SRRs" field 52 of the SRRI<br>
	header 50 as "1st opened SRR" among the maximum 16 possible opened<br>
	SRRs. The remaining "2nd to 16th opened SRR" fields of the 52(FIG.<br>
	7D) are set to zero.<br>
20	Referring to FIG. 5C, again, SRR numbers #1 to #5 are given to five SRRs in<br>
	sequence, respectively. The SRR #1 is a complete SRR without padding.<br><br>
24<br>
	which is indicated in the corresponding SRR entry by the P-flag of "Ob". The<br>
	SRR #2 is a closed partially recorded SRR with padding, which is indicated<br>
	in the corresponding SRR entry by the P-flag of "lb". The SRR #3 is a closed<br>
	empty SRR with padding, which is indicated in the corresponding SRR cntry<br>
5	by the P-flag of "1b". The SRR #4 is a complete SRR without padding, which<br>
	is indicated in the corresponding SRR entry by the P-flag of "Ob". The SRR<br>
	#5 is an invisible SRR without padding, which is indicated in the<br>
	corresponding SRR entry by the P-flag of "Ob".<br>
	In the case of FIG- 5C, three SRRs #1, #4 and #5 have no padding as<br>
10	indicated by the P-flags of "Ob". Two SRRs #2 and #3 have padding as<br>
	indicated by the P-flags of "lb". The opened SRR is the SRR #5 (invisible<br>
	SRR). Therefore, only the SRR #5 is recorded in the "List of opened SRRs"<br>
	Field 52 of the SRRI header 50 as "1st opened SRR". The remaining "2nd to<br>
	16th opened SRR" fields of the field 52 are set to zero.<br>
15	Accordingly, by defining the P-flag within the SRR status field of the SRR<br>
	entry as in the first embodiment, different types of closed SRRs can be<br>
	further distinguished. The LRA and start address information are present<br>
	within the SRR entry. For example, as can be seen in FIGs. 3C, 3D and 3E.<br>
	among these closed SRRs, the SRRs can be distinguished from each other<br>
20	because the locations of the LRAs are different from each other. However,<br>
	comparing FIGs. 3B and 3D, the closed SRRs have the same LRAs. In this<br><br>
25<br>
	case, SRR type identification through the LRA is difficult. In such cases, it<br>
	may be necessary to distinguish the SSRs according to the padding<br>
	operation using the P-flags. Similarly, in FIGs. 3A and 3E, the types of the<br>
	SRRs can be distinguished according to the padding operation using the P-<br>
5	flags.<br>
	According to an embodiment of the present invention, in order to distinguish<br>
	the types of SRRs, there is a method of directly representing the presence or<br>
	absence of the padding within the padded cluster of the SRR, without<br>
	recording the information on the presence of the padding using the P-flag in<br>
10	the SRR entry. It is apparent that such a method is included within the<br>
	scope of this invention. In such a method, the presence or absence of<br>
	predetermined padded data (e.g., dummy data or specific real data) in an<br>
	SRR may be looked for to distinguish the type of that SRR.<br>
	FIG. 6A illustrates a second embodiment of the SRR entry according to the<br>
15	present invention. The SRR entry structure of FIG. 6A is applied to each<br>
	SRR entry 35 of FIG. 1, but can be applied to any other SRR entry of a disc.<br>
	As shown, the SRR entry 35 includes a SRR status field 31, a start address<br>
	field 32, a reserved field 33 and an LRA field 34 as discussed above.<br>
	Specifically, 4-bit SRR status information is stored in the SRR status field<br>
20	31 and is used to distinguish whether the corresponding SRR is closed with<br>
	padding or without padding and to dintingush whether or not the<br><br>
26<br>
	corresponding SRR is the start SRR of a session. Bun, since the start<br>
	address field and the LRA field of the SRR entry in FIG. 6A are the same as<br>
	those shown in FIG. 5A their description will be omitted.<br>
	The related art disc such as DVD requires additional areas (for example,<br>
5	boarder-in/boarder-out) in order to distinguish the session, but the<br>
	additional area causes the entire recording capacity of the disc to be reduced.<br>
	Therefore, the present invention advantageously provides information<br>
	identifying the start of the session in order to allow the session structure of<br>
	the entire disc to be easily checked using only a session flag without the<br>
10	allocation of the additional area.<br>
	Accordingly, the status field 31 of the SRR entry 35 as shown in FIG. 6A<br>
	includes one bit (31a) carrying a P-flag for identifying whether or not the<br>
	padding is performed in the corresponding SRR, and another bit (31c) used<br>
	as a session flag (hereinafter, referred to as an "S-flag") for identifying<br>
15	whether or not the corresponding SRR is a session start SRR (start of a<br>
	session). The remaining 2 bits (31d) of the status field 31 remain as a<br>
	reserved area for coping with future modifications in the standard as needed.<br>
	As in the example of FIG. 5A. if the P-flag in FIG. 6A has a value of "lb", it<br>
	means that the corresponding SRR is a closed SRR in which the padding<br>
20	has been performed. If the P-flag has a value of "Ob", it means that the<br>
	corresponding SRR is an SRR in which no padding has been performed.<br><br>
27<br>
	Accordingly, if the P-flag has the value of "Ob", the corresponding SRR can<br>
	be an opened SRR or a closed SSR. However, if the corresponding SRR is an<br>
	SRR that is registered in the "List of opened SRRs" field 52 within the SRRI<br>
	header 50, it means the corresponding SRR is an opened SRR; however, if it<br>
5	is not registered, it means the corresponding SRR is a closed SRR.<br>
	Further, in the example or FIG. 6A, if the S-flag has a value of "lb", it means<br>
	that the corresponding SRR is the session start SRR. If the S-flag has a<br>
	value of "Ob", it means that the corresponding SRR is not the session start<br>
	SRR. Other values may be used for the S-flag and/or P-flag.<br>
10	FIGs. 6B and 6C illustrate two examples of recording the P-flag and the S-<br>
	flag of FIG. 6A based on the method of creating the SRR entry according to<br>
	the second embodiment of the present invention. For the convenience of<br>
	explanation, FIG. 6B illustrates the case of FIG. 4F in which no padding has<br>
	been performed in the closing of the SRR(s), and FIG. 6C illustrates the case<br>
15	of FIG. 4G in which padding has been performed in the closing of the SRR(s).<br>
	Referring to FIG. 6B, in the example, SRR numbers #1 to #5 are assigned to<br>
	five SRRs in sequence, respectively, and the sessions include two complete<br>
	sessions #1 and #2 and one empty session #3.<br>
	The SRR #2 in FIG. 6B is a closed partially recorded SRR without padding,<br>
20	which is indicated in the corresponding SRR entry (SSR #2 entry) by the P-<br>
	flag of "Ob". The S-flag in the SRR #2 entry has a value of "1b" because the<br><br>
28<br>
	SRR #2 is the session start SRR, i.e., the start SRR of the session #2.<br>
	The SRR #3 in FIG. 6B is a closed empty SRR without padding, which is<br>
	indicated in the SRR #3 entry by the P-flag of "Ob". The S-flag in the SRR #3<br>
	entry has a value of "Ob" because the SRR #3 is not the start SRR of the<br>
5	session #2.<br>
	The SRR #4 in FIG. 6B is a complete SRR without padding, which is<br>
	indicated in the SRR #4 entry by the P-flag of "Ob". The S-flag in the SRR<br>
	#4 entry has a value of "Ob" because the SRR #4 is not the start SRR or the<br>
	session #2.<br>
10	The SRR #5 in FIG. 6B is an invisible SRR without padding, which is<br>
	indicated in the SRR #5 entry by the P-flag of "Ob". The S-flag in the SRR #5<br>
	entry has a value of "1b" because the SRR #5 is the start/end SRR of the<br>
	session #3.<br>
	In the ease of FIG. 6B, all SRRs have no padding as indicated by the P-flags<br>
15	of "Ob". In ease of the session start SRRs #1, #2 and #5, their S-flags have a<br>
	value of "lb". The opened SRR is the SRR #5 (invisible SRR). Therefore,<br>
	only the SRR #5 is recorded in the "List of opened SRRs" field 52 within the<br>
	SRRI header 50 as "1st opened SRR".<br>
	Referring to FIG. 6C, in the example, SRR numbers #1 to #5 are assigned to<br>
20	five SRRs in sequence, respectively and the sessions include two complete<br>
	session #1 and #2 and one empty session #3.<br><br>
29<br>
	The SRR #2 in FIG. 6C is a closed SRR #2 with padding, which is indicated<br>
	in the corresponding SRR entry (SRR #2 entry) by the P-flag of "1b". The S-<br>
	flag in the SRR #2 entry has a value of "lb" because the SRR #2 is the<br>
	session start SRR, i.e., the start SRR of the session #2.<br>
5	The SRR #3 in FIG. 6C is a closed empty SRR with padding, which is<br>
	indicated in the SRR #3 entry by the P-flag of "lb". The S-flag in the SRR #3<br>
	entry has a value of "Ob" because the SRR #3 is not the start SRR of the<br>
	session #2.<br>
	The SRR #4 in FIG. 6C is a complete SRR without padding, which is<br>
10	indicated in the SRR #4 entry by the P-flag of "Ob". The S-flag in the SRR<br>
	#4 entry has a value of "Ob" because the SRR #4 is not the start SRR of the<br>
	session #2.<br>
	The SRR #5 in FIG. 6C is an invisible SRR without padding, which is<br>
	indicated in the SRR #5 entry by the P-flag of "Ob". The S-flag in the SRR #5<br>
15	entry has a value of "lb" because the SRR #5 is the start SRR of the session<br>
	#3.<br>
	In the case of FIG. 6C, three SRRs #1, #4 and #5 have no padding as<br>
	indicated by their P-flags of "Ob". Two SRRs #2 and #3 have the padding as<br>
	indicated by their P-flags of "lb". In the session start SRRs #2 and #3, their<br>
20	S-flags are recorded with "lb". Also, similar to the case of FIG. 6B, the<br>
	opened SRR is only the SRR #5 (invisible SRR). Therefore, only the SRR #5<br><br>
30<br>
	is recorded in the "List of opened SRRs" field 52 of the SRRI header 50 as<br>
	"1st opened SRR".<br>
	Accordingly, by defining both the "P-flag" and "S-flag" within the SRR status<br>
	information as in the second embodiment, the closed SRRs can be<br>
5	distinguished using the padding. Different types of sessions can be<br>
	distinguished without having to allocate additional areas to the start and<br>
	end of the session, thus improving the efficiency of the optical<br>
	recording/playback operations significantly.<br>
	A method of recording and updating the SRRI that indicates the recorded<br>
10	status of the disc according, to the present invention will be now described.<br>
	Specifically, specific data are padded in closing the SRR(s) and the lost SRRI<br>
	can be effectively recovered using the padded SRR(s).<br>
	FIG. 7A illustrates an initial blank disc that is in a recordable status all over<br>
	the entire area. A start location of the disc becomes the NWA. In such a<br>
15	state, only one SRR is present at the disc. This is the same as the invisible<br>
	SRR shown in FIG. 2A. Therefore, the session is in the disc initial status in<br>
	which only one empty session is present. This is the case of the blank disc<br>
	in which the SRRI is not yet recorded.<br>
	FIG. 7B illustrate a case that some portion of the blank disc of FIG. 7A is<br>
20	recorded with data, but the session is not closed. In such a state, only one<br>
	SRR (SRR #1) is present at the disc. This is the same as the incomplete SRR<br><br>
31<br>
	shown in FIG. 2B. Therefore, the disc is in such a status that only one<br>
	incomplete session is present.<br>
	FIG. 7C illustrates a process of recording an SRRI in the management area<br>
	of the disc when the disc is in the state of FIG. 7B. For the convenience of<br>
5	explanation, only certain portions among all the different components of the<br>
	disc structure and SRRI structure shown in FIG. 1 are shown. For instance,<br>
	although the (SRRI + TDDS) or (TDFL + TDDS) are recorded in each cluster<br>
	of the TDMA such as the TDMAO of the disc as discussed above, only the<br>
	SRRI is shown in the TDMAO of FIG. 7C, and the TDFL and/or TDDS is<br>
10	omitted for the sake of clarity. Further, only the "List of opened SRRs" field<br>
	52 and the "List of SRR entries" field 30 among the different fields of the<br>
	SRRI shown in FIG. 1 are shown.<br>
	The disc recorded status of FIG. 7C is the case where only one opened SRR<br>
	(SRR #1) is present in all the disc area as in FIG. 7B. As shown in FIG. 7C,<br>
15	when the incomplete SRR #1 is formed without closing the session as in FIG.<br>
	7B, the SRRI #1 (60a) pertaining to the SRR #1 is generated and recorded in<br>
	the TDMAO. In the SRRI #1 (60a), the SRR number of the opened SRR #1 is<br>
	recorded in its "List ol opened SRRs" field 52a. In the "List of SRR entries"<br>
	field 30a of the SRRI #1 (60a), only one SRR entry 35a pertaining to the SRR<br>
20	#1 is present. The SRR entry 35a (or SRR entries 35b-35p discussed later)<br>
	can have the SRR entry structure of FIG. 5A or 6A discussed above.<br><br>
32<br>
	FIG. 7D illustrates a detailed structure of the "List of opened SRRs" field,<br>
	which is recorded in the SRRI header, according to an embodiment of the<br>
	present invention. The structure of this field as shown in FIG. 7D is<br>
	applicable to any "List of opened SRRs" fieid of the present invention, such<br>
5	as the fields 52 and 52a-52f (discussed later). The information stored in this<br>
	field is used to identify the location of any opened SRR(s). The usage of this<br>
	field is described as follows in more detail.<br>
	The opened SRR entry numher is recorded, as the information on the<br>
	location of the opened SRR entry, in the "List of opened SRRs" field of the<br>
10	SRRI. That is, the location of the opened SRR entry is identified using the<br>
	"opened SRR number" wherein the total number of opened SRRs that is<br>
	allowed at a given time is maximum sixteen, in this example. Two bytes are<br>
	allotted to store each of the sixteen different opened SRR numbers.<br>
	To carry out an operation on a disc, the recording/playback apparatus must<br>
15	determine the recordable location(s) of the disc when the optical disc is<br>
	loaded. This is possible by obtaining the NWA value from any opened SRR.<br>
	Accordingly, the recording/playback apparatus needs to know the location<br>
	of any opened SRR on the disc to be able to determine the recordable<br>
	location(s) on the disc. However, since there is no information that identifies<br>
20	directly whether a particular SRR is an opened SRR or a closed SRR, the<br>
	present invention provides the "List of opened SRRs" field at the header of<br><br>
33<br>
	an SRRI and accesses this field to obtain the location of any opened SRR by<br>
	the SRR numbers. Once the opened SRR number is identified, the<br>
	corresponding SRR number entry can be accessed from the SRRI to obtain<br>
	the exact location (i.e., by accessing the start address in the start address<br>
5	field of the SRK entry) of the opened SRR. In this manner, the optical<br>
	recording/playback apparatus can read out the opened SRR entry<br>
	information more easily.<br>
	According to the present invention, only the SRR whose SRR number is<br>
	recorded in the "List of opened SRRs" field of the SRRI is considered to be an<br>
10	opened SRR. If the opened SRR is changed to a closed SRR, the SRR<br>
	number of the changed SRR is erased or removed from "List of opened<br>
	SRRs" field. Applied differently, to close a particular opened SRR, e.g., in<br>
	response to a close command, the SRR of that SRR is removed from the "List<br>
	of opened SRRs" field of the SRRI. Removal of the SRR number from the<br>
15	"List of opened SRRs" field then indicates the closing of the corresponding<br>
	SRR.<br>
	FIG. 8A illustrates a case when a session close command is executed when<br>
	the disc is in the state of FIG. 7B. As shown in FIG. 8A, the existing data<br>
	recorded area is separated into an independent closed SRR by the session<br>
20	close command and a new session is generated. In other words, the<br>
	complete recorded area in FIG. 7B becomes a complete SRR #1, which in<br><br>
34<br>
	turn constitutes a complete session #1. The non-recorded area then<br>
	becomes an invisible SRR #2, which in turn constitutes an empty session #2.<br>
	FIG. 8B illustrates a process of recording the disc recorded status as it<br>
	pertains to the disc state as of FIG. 8A. As shown in FIG. 8B, an SRRI #2<br>
5	(60b) is recorded in the TDMAO, next to the previously recorded SRRI #1<br>
	(60a). Since the disc recorded status of FIG. 8A is the case where only one<br>
	opened SRR (SRR #2) and one closed SRR (SRR #1) are present on the entire<br>
	disc area, the corresponding opened SRR number (SRR #2) is recorded in<br>
	the "List of opened SRRs" field 52b of the SRRI #2 (60b). Further,<br>
10	information on the two SRR entries (SRR #1 and SRR #2) is recorded in the<br>
	"List of SRR entries" field 30b of the SRRI #2 (60b) as SRR entries 35b and<br>
	35c.<br>
	In FIG. 8B, a closed SRR entry has bean indicated using a shaded merk.<br>
	Although not shown, it should understood that along with the recording of<br>
15	the SRRI #2 (60b) in the TDMAO, other management information such as the<br>
	updated TDDS information is also recorded in the corresponding cluster (or<br>
	recording-unit) of the TDMAO.<br>
	FIG. 9A illustrates a case when two opened SRRs are reserved for a new<br>
	recording from the disc state of FIG. 8A. As shown in FIG. 9A, the newly<br>
20	reserved opened SRRs become an opened empty SRR #2 and an opened<br>
	empty SRR #3 each having an appropriate NWA as indicated by the thick<br><br>
35<br>
	arrows. The remaining area becomes an invisible (opened) SRR #4. The<br>
	sessions include the complete session #1 and the session #2 which has been<br>
	changed from the empty session to the incomplete session.<br>
	FIG. 9B illustrates a process of recording the disc recorded status as it<br>
5	pertains to the disc state as of FIG. 9A. As shown in FIG. 9B, another SRRI<br>
	#3 (60c) is recorded in the TDMAO, next to the previously recorded SRRI #2<br>
	(60b). Since the disc recorded status of FIG. 9A is the case where three<br>
	opened SRRs (SRRs #2, #3, #4) and one closed SRR (SRR #l) are present,<br>
	the corresponding opened SRR numbers (SRRs #2, #3, #4) are recorded in<br>
10	the "List of opened SRRs" field 52c of the SRR1 #3 (60c). Further,<br>
	information on all four SRR entries (SRRs #l-#4) is recorded in the "List of<br>
	SRR entries" field 30c of the SRRI #3 (60c) as SRR entries 35d-35g,<br>
	respectively.<br>
	In FIG. 9B, a closed SRR entry has been indicated using a shaded mark.<br>
15	Although not shown, it should understood that along with the recording of<br>
	the SRRI #3 (60c) in the TDMAO, other management information such as the<br>
	updated TDDS information is also recorded in the corresponding cluster (or<br>
	recording unit) of the TDMAO.<br>
	FIG. 10A illustrates a case when data are recorded to the first empty SRR<br>
20	(SRR #2) and to the invisible SRR (SRR #4) in the disc state of FIG. 9A. As a<br>
	result, the first empty SRR is changed to the opened partially recorded SRR<br><br>
36<br>
	#2, the invisible SRR is changed to the incomplete SRR #4, but the opened<br>
	empty SRR #3 is not changed.<br>
	FIG. 10B illustrates a process of recording the disc recorded status as it<br>
	pertains to the disc state as of FIG. 10A. As shown in FIG. 10B, another<br>
5	SRRI #4 (60d) is recorded in the TDMAO, next to the previously recorded<br>
	SRRI #3 (60c). Since the disc recorded status of FIG. 10A is the case where<br>
	three opened SRRs (SRRs #2, #3, #4) and one closed SRR (SRR #1) are<br>
	present, the corresponding opened SRR numbers (SRRs #2, #3, #4) are<br>
	recorded in the "List of opened SRRs" field 52d of the SRRI #4 (60d).<br>
10	Further, information on all four SRR entries (SRRs #1- #4) is recorded in the<br>
	"List of SRR entries" field 30d of the SRRI #4 (60d) as SRR entries 35h-35k,<br>
	respectively.<br>
	In FIG. 10B, a closed SRR entry has been indicated using a shaded mark.<br>
	Although not shown, it should understood that along with the recording of<br>
15	the SRRI #4 (60d) in the TDMAO, other management information such as the<br>
	updated TDDS information is also recorded in the corresponding cluster (or<br>
	recording unit) of the TDMAO.<br>
	The number of SRR entries and the location of the opened SRRs in FIG. 10B<br>
	are equal to the case of FIG. 9B. However, since recording in the specific<br>
20	opened SRR has been performed as shown in FIG. 10A, the LRA information<br>
	within the opened SRR entry in which such recording is performed is<br><br>
37<br>
	changed. Therefore, the additionally recordable NWA location is also<br>
	changed.<br>
	FIG. 11A illustrates a case when a session close command is executed in the<br>
	disc state of FIG. 10A. but its opened SRR is closed after some additionally<br>
5	recordable area of the opened SRR is padded. In the padding operation, the<br>
	entire or some part of the additionally recordable area of the opened SRR<br>
	may be selectively padded as discussed above. The padding is performed<br>
	using dummy data (e.g., zero) or specific real data (e.g., character code<br>
	"CLSD") as padding data as discussed above. That is, the padding operation<br>
10	in FIG. 11A is the same as that discussed in connection with FIGs. 3D and<br>
	3E.<br>
	As shown in FIG. 11A, the existing data recorded area becomes an<br>
	independent complete session by the session close command and all SRRs<br>
	contained in that complete session are changed to closed SRRs. For<br>
15	instance, in response to the session close command, a part (e.g., a first<br>
	cluster after the LRA) of each opened SRR is padded and the SRRs are<br>
	closed. In this case, the LRA information recorded in the SRR entry means<br>
	the last recorded area on which the actual user data are recorded, and the<br>
	dummy data portion does not influence the determination of the LRA<br>
20	location. After the close command has been executed, this results in a<br>
	closed partially recorded SRR #2, a closed empty SRR #3 and the complete<br><br>
38<br>
	SRR #4, which in turn constitute a newly reserved complete session #2. The<br>
	remaining outermost SRR becomes an invisible (opened) SRR #5, which in<br>
	turn constitutes an empty session #3.<br>
	FIG. 11B illustrates a process of recording the disc recorded status as it<br>
5	pertains to the disc state as of FIG. 11A. As shown in FIG. 11B, another<br>
	SRRI #5 (60e) is recorded in the TDMAO, next to the previously recorded<br>
	SRRI #4 (60d). Since the disc recorded status of FIG. 11A is the case where<br>
	only one opened SRR (SRR #5) and four closed SRRs (SRRs #1 - #4) are<br>
	present, the corresponding opened SRR number (SRR #5) is recorded in the<br>
10	"List of opened SRRs" field 52e of the SRRI #5 (60e). Further, information<br>
	on all five SRR entries (SRRs #1- #5) is recorded in the "List of SRR entries"<br>
	field 30e of the SRRI #5 (60e) as SRR entries 35l-35p, respectively.<br>
	In FIG. 11B, a closed SRR entry has been indicated using a shaded mark.<br>
	Although not shown, it should understood that along with the recording of<br>
15	the SRRI #5 (60e) in the TDMAO, other management information such as the<br>
	updated TDDS information is also recorded in the corresponding cluster (or<br>
	recording unit) of the TDMAO.<br>
	In the case of the SRR #2 and SRR #3 in which the dummy data are padded<br>
	by the close command, the last location in which the actual user data are<br>
20	recorded is recorded in the LRA field of the corresponding SRR entry.<br>
	Also, if the P-flag is present in the status field of the SRR entry as discussed<br><br>
39<br>
	above, it is possible to recognize that the corresponding closed SRR is closed<br>
	by the padding. If the P-flag is not present in the SRR entry, it can be<br>
	determined that the corresponding SRR is a padded SRR by examining the<br>
	recorded status of the SRR area after its LRA, i.e., by checking to see the<br>
5	presence or absence of specific padding data at the NWA (after LRA) of the<br>
	SRR.<br>
	As can be seen through FIGs. 7A to 11B, SRRI is the information indicating<br>
	the recorded status of the current disc. The recording/playback apparatus<br>
	must check the latest SRRI (SRRI #5, in the above example) finally recorded<br>
10	in the management area, when the corresponding disc is loaded. Since only<br>
	the latest SRRI correctly indicates the final recorded status of the disc, it is<br>
	possible to check the location of the additionally recorded SRR.<br>
	However, when the power is suddenly turned off while using the disc or the<br>
	disc is damaged, the latest SRRI of the disc may be not read out correctly.<br>
15	At this time, the final recorded status need to be reconstructed using the<br>
	latest SRRI among the non-damaged SRRIs. According to the present<br>
	invention, the SRR is padded in the padding operation when the SRR is to<br>
	be closed, and this padding infomation can be used to reconstruct the final<br>
	recorded status of the disc even when the latest SRRI on the disc is at a<br>
20	damaged condition. Through it, it is possible to recover the latest SRRI and<br>
	the current recorded status of the disc.<br><br>
40<br>
	FIGs. 12, 13A and 13B illustrate a recording method of a write-once optical<br>
	disc according to the present invention. This method recovers the latest<br>
	SRRI of the disc, even when the latest SRRI is damaged, and the<br>
	recording/playing back can be performed using the finally recorded status<br>
5	obtained from the latest SRRI.<br>
	When the corresponding SRRI is judged as a defective area and the recorded<br>
	information is not reliable, the SRRI is said to be damaged. If the latest<br>
	SRRI is damaged, it means that the finally recorded status of the disc<br>
	cannot be obtained from the latest SRRI. Therefore, the recordable location<br>
10	of the disc cannot be known. In the worst case, the disc itself cannot be<br>
	used any more.<br>
	The present invention provides the method of correctly recovering the finally<br>
	recorded status of the disc when the latest SRRI is damaged. Particularly,<br>
	FIG. 12 is a flowchart illustrating a method of recovering the finally recorded<br>
15	status of a write-once optical disc such as a BD-WO and performing the<br>
	recording/playback operation on the disc according to an embodiment of the<br>
	present invention. The disc contains the disc structure and the SRRI<br>
	structure as discussed above.<br>
	Referring to FIG. 12, if the disc is loaded in an optical recording/playback<br>
20	apparatus such one shown in FIG. 14, the latest SRRI recorded within the<br>
	management area (e.g., the TDMAO) is read out. Then, it is checked whether<br><br>
41<br>
	or not the read SRRI is damaged (S10).<br>
	If the latest SRRI is not damaged, the final disc recorded status is obtained<br>
	from the latest SRRI (S21). Then using the latest SRRI, the recording is<br>
	performed to only the additionally recordable area and/or the playback<br>
5	operation is performed to the already recorded area (S22). The information<br>
	on such areas is obtained from the latest SRRI.<br>
	On the other hand, if the step S10 determines that the latest SRRI is<br>
	damaged, the latest SRRI among the non-damaged SRRI(s) is determined<br>
	(S31). Then this latest non-damaged SRRI is read out (S32). The damaged<br>
10	SRRI can be recovered using the latest non-damaged SRRI and the actual<br>
	recorded status of the disc (S33). Step S33 may be an optional step. The<br>
	recording is performed to the additionally recorded area and/or the playback<br>
	operation is performed to the already recorded area (S34). Information on<br>
	such areas can be determined from the latest non-damaged SRRI and/or the<br>
15	actual recorded status of the disc. After the recording/playback step S34,<br>
	the newly changed recorded status may be recorded as a new SRRI in the<br>
	management area.<br>
	FIGs. 13A and 13B illustrates an example of the step S33 in FIG. 12 of<br>
	recovering the finally recorded status when the latest SRRI (SRRI #5 in the<br>
20	example of FIG. 11B) is damaged. For the convenience of explanation, the<br>
	SRRI recording method of FIGs. 7A to 11B will be described as an example.<br><br>
42<br>
	As shown in FIG. 13A, if the SRRls are in the normal status, the SRRI #5<br>
	(60e) becomes the latest SRRI of the disc. However, if the SRRI #5 is<br>
	damaged, the recording/playback apparatus reads the latest SRRI among<br>
	the non-damaged SRRIs. In the example, the SRRI #4 (60d) is the latest<br>
5	SRRI among the non-damaged SRRIs #1 - #4.<br>
	The actual recorded status associated with step 6 in FIG. 11A can be<br>
	determined from the SRRI #5 (60e) which is written as indicated in FIG. 11B.<br>
	However, since the SRRI #5 (60e) is damaged, the latest SRR information<br>
	that can be checked by the recording/playback apparatus is the SRRI #4<br>
10	(60d). But the SRRI #4 does not necessarily carry the finally recorded status<br>
	of the disc since the SRRI #5 carries this information. Then, in order to<br>
	recover the finally recorded status of the disc without using the SRRI #5, the<br>
	SRRI #4 and the actual finally recorded status of the disc need to be<br>
	compared. This can be accomplished as follows.<br>
15	The recording/playback apparatus checks the location of the opened SRR(s)<br>
	and the associated LRA information from the SRRI #4. In the example of<br>
	FIG. 13A, it is determined from the "List of opened SRRs" field 52d of the<br>
	SRRI #4 (60d) that there are three opened SRRs #2, #3 and #4. Then by<br>
	accessing the LRA field of these SRR entries corresponding to these opened<br>
20	SRRs from the "List of SRR entries" field 30d of the SRRI #4 (60d), the LRAs<br>
	are obtained and used to verify whether the corresponding SRR is truly an<br><br>
43<br>
	opened SRR. In this regard, only the opened SRR(s) identified in the field<br>
	52d of the SRRI #4 (60d) are examined. The location recorded with the<br>
	closed SRR(s) may not be verified. Once an opened SRR is changed to a<br>
	closed SRR, the closed SRR cannot be changed back to an opened SRR. As<br>
5	a result, the recovery of the final SRR information is possible by checking<br>
	whether each of the opened SRR(s) is changed to the closed SRR.<br>
	In the case of the SRRs #2 and #3 that are identified as the opened SRRs in<br>
	the field 52d of the SRRI #4 (60d), each of the SRRs #2 and #3 is examined<br>
	to determine whether or not predetermined padding data (e.g., dummy data)<br>
10	are recorded after its LRA (identified in the LRA field of the entry), as can be<br>
	seen from FIG. 11A (actual final disc recorded status). If the padding is<br>
	detected, then the recording/playback apparatus determines that the<br>
	corresponding opened SRR is changed to a closed SRR.<br>
	In the case of the SRR #4 that is recognized as the opened SRR from the<br>
15	field 52d of the SRRI #4, the recording/playback apparatus examines the<br>
	SRR #4 to determine whether or not the padding data (e.g., dummy data) are<br>
	presented after its LRA location in FIG. 11A (actual final disc recorded<br>
	status). The SRR #4 can be analyzed as the opened SRR in the actual final<br>
	disc recorded status. Also, it can be seen that an area after the LRA location<br>
20	of the SRR #4 is recordable, i.e., this area is the NWA. Then in the<br>
	recording/playback apparatus, the already recorded area of the original SRR<br><br>
44<br>
	#4 is determined to a closed SRR (new closed SRR #4) and only the<br>
	recordable area of the original SRR #4 is analyzed as the opened SRR (new<br>
	SRR #5). Thus the contents of the damaged SRRI #5 can be reconstructed<br>
	by using the above analysis results. Moreover, since the information<br>
5	necessary to perform the recording operation by the recording/playback<br>
	apparatus is the additionally recordable position information (NWA), the<br>
	NWA location in association with the old and new SRR #4 is not changed<br>
	and thus can be used by the recording/playback apparatus.<br>
	FIG. 13B illustrates a result of the recovery of the latest SRRI #5 by the<br>
10	process of FIG. 13A as discussed above. This result accords with the final<br>
	recorded status of the actual disc. Accordingly, the recording/playback<br>
	apparatus again records the selectively recovered latest SRRI #5 within the<br>
	management area (at this time, as the SRRI #6 (60f)), or performs the<br>
	recording to only the additionally recordable area. The SRRI #6 (60f)<br>
15	includes the "List of opened SRRs" field 52f identifying the SRR #5, and the<br>
	"List of SRR entries" field 30f containing SRR entries 35q-35u corresponding<br>
	respectively to the SRRs #1 - #5. Also, even if the recovered SRRI #5 is not<br>
	recorded as the SRRI #6, data recording is performed from the recovered<br>
	NWA information and the recorded status as changed by the data recording<br>
20	to the recovered NWA is recorded as a new SRRI #6.<br>
	FIG. 14 illustrates an optical disc recording/playback apparatus according<br><br>
45<br>
	to the present invention. This apparatus or other suitable apparatus or<br>
	system can be used to implement the disc and/or SRRI structures and<br>
	methods of the present invention discussed herein.<br>
	Referring to FIG. 14, the optical disc recording/playback apparatus includes<br>
5	a recording/playback unit 10 for recording and/or reproducing data to/from<br>
	the optical disc and a controller 20 for controlling the recording/playback<br>
	unit 10. All the elements of the recording/playback apparatus are<br>
	opcratively coupled. The controller 20 transmits a command for recording<br>
	and/or reproducing to/from a special recording area such as an<br>
10	SRR/session on the disc, to the recording/playback unit 10. The<br>
	recording/playback unit 10 records and/or reproduces data to/from the<br>
	disc according to the commands of the controller 20.<br>
	The recording/playback unit 10 includes an interlace unit 12, a pick-up<br>
	unit 11, a data processor 13, a servo unit 14, a memory 15 and a<br>
15	microcomputer 16. The interface unit 12 communicates with external<br>
	devices such as the controller 20. The pick-up unit 11 records or<br>
	reproduces data to/from the optical disc directly. The data processor 13<br>
	receives a reproduction signal from the pick-up unit 11, restores a preferred<br>
	signal, modulates a signal proper to the optical disc, and transmits the<br>
20	signal. The servo unit 14 controls the pick-up unit 11 to read the signal<br>
	from the optical disc or to record the signal to the optical disc. The memory<br><br>
46<br>
	15 stores temporarily data, and various information including management<br>
	information as discussed herein. The microcomputer 16 controls the<br>
	components of the recording/playback unit 10. Since the<br>
	recording/playback apparatus shown in FIG. 14 can selectively perform a<br>
5	padding operation, a designer can more freely design the recording/playback<br>
	apparatus. The recording/playback unit 10 can automatically store specific<br>
	data during a padding operation.<br>
	Industrial Applicability<br>
10	The recording/playback method of the optical disc according to the present<br>
	invention may be divided into mainly two parts. First, as in the cases of<br>
	FIGs. 4 to 6C, the padding is determined in the selective closed SRR and an<br>
	information (e.g., P-flag) for identifying whether or not the padding is<br>
	performed is recorded. Second, as in the cases of FIGs. 7A to 13B, the SRRI<br>
15	is effectively recovered by examining the SRR to determine if padding has<br>
	been performed in the SRR. In other words, the presence or absence of the<br>
	padding in the closed SRR is a selective matter. However, according to the<br>
	present invention, the case of closing the SRR with padding may be more<br>
	advantages to data restoration.<br>
20	The recording/playback method of the optical disc according to an<br>
	embodiment of the present invention will be now described in detail. First, if<br><br>
47<br>
	the optical disc is loaded into the recording/playback apparatus, the SRRI<br>
	recorded in a preset management area of the optical disc as the latest disc<br>
	management information is read out together with the header and SRR<br>
	entry(ies) of the SRRI, and the read out information is temporarily stored in<br>
5	the memory 15 of the recording/playback unit 10. Since the latest disc<br>
	recorded status is recorded within the SRRI, the opened SRR is identifiable<br>
	through the SRRI header information. The recorded or non-recorded status<br>
	of the disc can be checked through the SRRI header information. Also, the<br>
	presence or absence of the padding can be identifiable. This can be used in<br>
10	the recording/playback of the disc.<br>
	For instance, the microcomputer 16 can accurately check the SRR status<br>
	existing within the disc from the SRRI, so that the recordable location (NWA)<br>
	can be known from the checked opened SRR(s). Also, the presence or<br>
	absence of the padding can be checked as discussed above. If the SRR is<br>
15	closed by the close command of the controller 20, the microcomputer 16 can<br>
	select the closing with padding or the closing without padding. Also, it is<br>
	possible to close the SRR without the padding in response to a specific<br>
	command of the controller 20.<br>
	In case the SRR status is changed by the padding, the P-flag of the<br>
20	corresponding SRR entry is modified and recorded, such that other<br>
	recording/playback apparatus can use this information. Such a function<br><br>
48<br>
	can be named "automatic padding function" of the recording/ playback unit<br>
	10. This function is advantageous because it reduces the padding operation<br>
	time. According to the present invention, the recording/playback apparatus<br>
	with desired performance can be designed in various manners by defining<br>
5	the types of SRRs and providing the methods of recording the SRRs and<br>
	SRRIs.<br>
	Another recording/playback method according to the present invention will<br>
	be described now. First, if the optical disc is loaded into the<br>
	recording/playback apparatus, the controller 20 controls the pickup unit 11<br>
10	to read out the latest SRRI recorded in the TDMA and determines whether<br>
	the latest SRRJ is damaged. If the latest SRRI is damaged, the latest SRRI is<br>
	recovered from non-damaged SRRIs, as described in FIGs. 12, \3A and 13B.<br>
	The latest SRRI can be recovered by checking the dummy data padded<br>
	within the disc when the opened SRR is changed to the closed SRR.<br>
15	If there is no damage in the latest SRRI, the recording/ playback unit 10<br>
	performs the recording by checking the location of the additionally<br>
	recordable opened SRR. Then, if the close command is received from the<br>
	controller 20, the recording/playback unit 10 performs the padding to some<br>
	or the entire area of additionally recordable areas remaining in the opened<br>
20	SRR, to dose the SRR. Then, the changed recorded status of the disc is<br>
	recorded in the latest SRRI within the management area. Even if any<br><br>
49<br>
	recording/playback apparatus again loads the corresponding optical disc<br>
	and there is damage to the latest SRRI, the final recorded status of the disc<br>
	can be checked.<br>
	It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and<br>
5	variations can be made in the present invention. Thus, it is intended that<br>
	the present invention covers the modifications and variations of this<br>
	invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and<br>
	their equivalents.<br><br>
