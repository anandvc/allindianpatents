COMPOSITION FOR PREVENTING PLANT DISEASES AND METHOD FOR<br>
PREVENTING THE DISEASES<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a composition for preventing plant diseases comprising at least two or more kinds of active ingredients and having a synergic control effect against plant diseases such as gray mold, powdery mildew, sclerotinia rot, alternaria leaf spot, diseases caused by Rhizoctonia and the like, and a method for preventing plant diseases.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
From the past, a large number of chemical fungicides have been used.  However, it has become obvious that there is a problem of resistance of plant pathogens against chemical active ingredients associated with frequent use or overdose of such chemical active ingredients with the same action having a similar skeleton for controlling diseases of the same kind.<br>
On the other hand, in late years, consumer's needs for crops with reduced agricultural chemicals or social needs for reduced environmental burdens of chemical pesticides.<br>
Furthermore, in a farm field where chemicals are actually used, when two or more kinds of chemicals are mixed together using a tank mixing method for the treatment, active<br><br>
ingredients which are incompatible with each other are combined, causing lots of risks such as reduced effects of each active ingredients or phytotoxicity suffering to the plants.<br>
Under these circumstances, compositions for preventing plant diseases with significant effect against fungi resistant to the existing active ingredients and with great effect even in a much smaller amount of an active ingredient have been in demand. Furthermore, in order to prevent plant pathogens from having chemical resistance as well, there have been demanded a composition for preventing plant diseases with good compatibility comprising components (compounds) with different actions having different basic skeletons, and a method for preventing the plant diseases.<br>
In JP Patent Publication No. 1997-235282A and European Patent Publication No. 737682 is disclosed<br>
(RS)-N-[2-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)thiophen-3-yl]-l-methyl-3-tri fluoromethyl-lH-pyrazole-4-carboxamide (a common name: penthiopyrad (currently applied for ISO), hereinafter referred to as penthiopyrad) which has a control effect against various diseases.<br>

composition for preventing plant diseases with significant effect against fungi having resistance to the existing active ingredients and a composition for preventing plant diseases having high activity even in a small amount of an active ingredient to be given to habitation environment of plant pathogens.<br>
The present inventors had conducted a study on the combination of penthiopyrad and other fungicide components and as a result, had found that by combining penthiopyrad and specific fungicide components, a synergic control effect which was not expected with a single component against various plant pathogens could be obtained and no phytotoxicity suffering to plants were caused.  Thus, the present invention had been completed.<br>
That is, the present invention relates to a composition for preventing plant diseases and a method for preventing the diseases as specified by the following maters.<br>
[1]  A composition for preventing plant diseases comprising Components I and II as active ingredients, wherein the Component I is<br>
(RS)-N-[2-(l,3-dimethylbutyl)thiophen-3-yl]-l-methyl-3-tri fluoromethyl-lH-pyrazole-4-carboxamide, and<br>
the Component II is one or more compounds selected from a group consisting of tetraconazole, flutriafol, imibenconazole, triadimefon, simeconazole, oxpoconazole fumarate, prothioconazole, bupirimate, spiroxamine, metiram, dodine, anilazine, chlozolinate, oxycarboxin, ethaboxam,<br><br>

The composition for preventing plant diseases of the present invention achieves a synergic effect as compared to a single use of each of active ingredients (Component I or Component II).<br>
The preferred range of the composition for preventing plant diseases according to the present invention is different depending on its formulations, respectively. The penthiopyrad of the Component I is generally contained in the range of 0.01 weight part to 80 weight parts in 100 weight parts of the composition. In the composition for preventing plant diseases of the present invention, the mixture ratio of penthiopyrad of the Component I to a compound of the Component II is not particularly restricted. The compound of the Component II is usually contained in the range of 0.01 weight part to 50 weight parts, preferably in the range of 0.5 weight part to 50 weight parts, more preferably in the range of 0.5 weight part to 30 weight parts, and further preferably in the range of 1 weight part of 20 weight parts based on 1 weight part of the compound of the Component I.<br>
A composition comprising at the same time Components I and II is included in the composition for preventing plant diseases of the present invention. In addition to that, a case where a composition comprising Component I and a composition<br><br>
comprising Component II are treated to the habitation environment of plant pathogens almost at the same time is also included in the scope of the present invention.<br>
Furthermore, the composition for preventing plant diseases of the present invention can be prepared as a composition containing a compound of Component I and a compound of Component II at a high concentration.  The high-concentration composition can be diluted with water and used as a liquid for dispersion. Furthermore, the composition for preventing plant diseases according to the present invention can be prepared as a mixture by mixing a composition containing the Component I at a high concentration and a composition containing the Component II at a high concentration to use.  Such a high-concentration composition can be diluted with water and used as a dispersion (a tank mixing method). The composition for preventing plant diseases of the present invention may use an active ingredient as it is to the habitation environment of pathogens to be applied. It is generally blended with an inert liquid carrier, a solid carrier and a surface active agent and used in a usually used formulation form such as dust, wettable powder, flowable formulation, emulsifiable concentrate, granules and other generally accepted formulation forms. Furthermore, if needed for formulation purposes, an adjuvant in addition to the surfactant can be added thereto as well.<br>
The term "carrier" used herein refers to a synthetic or natural, inorganic or organic material which is mixed in order<br><br>
to help the active ingredient reach the site to be treated and make easier storage, transportation and handling of the active ingredient compounds. Both solid and liquid carriers can be used so long as the carriers are commonly used for agricultural and horticultural chemicals. No particular restriction is imposed upon the carriers.<br>
As for the solid carrier, there can be exemplified, for example, clays such as montmorillonite, kaolinite and the like; inorganic substances such as diatomaceous earth, white clay, talc, vermiculite, gypsum, calcium carbonate, silica gel, ammonium sulfate and the like; vegetable organic materials such as soybean flour, sawdust, wheat flour and the like; and urea.  Furthermore, in order to improve physical properties, high-dispersion silicic acid or high-dispersion absorbent polymer can also be added.  As for the liquid carrier, there can be exemplified, for example, aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, xylene, cumene and the like; paraffin hydrocarbons such as kerosene, mineral oil and the like; ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, cyclohexanone and the like; ethers such as dioxane, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether and the like; alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, ethylene glycol and the like; aprotic solvents such as dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide and the like; and water.<br>
Furthermore, the following various adjuvants can be added singly or in combination according to the object, while taking into account the formulation forms, the site of application, etc. Adjuvants are surface active agents which<br><br>
are commonly used; binders such as lignin sulfonic acid, alginic acid, polyvinyl alcohol, gum Arabic, CMC-sodium and the like; and stabilizers such as phenolic compounds, thiol compounds, higher fatty acid esters and the like as antioxidants, phosphates as pH controllers or sometimes light stabilizers. These adjuvants can be used, when necessary, singly or as a mixture. Further, in order to prevent bacteria and fungi, an industrial bactericide or an agent for preventing of decay can also be added in some cases.<br>
Meanwhile, examples of adjuvants which can be used for purpose of emulsification, dispersion, spreading, wetting, binding and stabilization include anionic surface active agents such as lignin sulfonate, alkylbenzene sulfonate, alkylsulfate ester salt, polyoxyalkylene alkylsulfate, polyoxyalkylene alkylphosphate ester salt and the like; nonionic surface active agents such as polyoxyalkylene alkyl ether, polyoxyalkylene alkyl aryl ether, polyoxyalkylene alkylamine, polyoxyalkylene alkylamide, polyoxyalkylene alkylthioether, polyoxyalkylene fatty acid ester, glycerine fatty acid ester, sorbitan fatty acid ester, polyoxyalkylene sorbitan fatty acid ester, polyoxypropylene polyoxyethylene block copolymer and the like; lubricants such as calcium stearate, wax and the like; stabilizers such as isopropyl hydrogen phosphate and the like; natural or synthetic phospholipids of the cephalin or lecithin series such as phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylglycerol, lysolecithin and the like; and other<br><br>
materials such as methylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, casein, gum Arabic and the like.  However, the adjuvants are not restricted to the aforementioned components.<br>
In the composition for preventing plant diseases according to the present invention, the total amount of the active ingredient  which combines the Component I and the Component II is different depending on the type of formulation. It is usually from 0.01 weight % to 30 weight % for dust formulation, from 0.1 weight % to 80 weight % for wettable powder, from 0.5 weight % to 20 weight % for granule, from 2 weight % to 50 weight % for emulsifiable concentrate, from 1 weight % to 50 weight % for flowable formulation, and from 1 weight % to 80 weight % for dry flowable formulation.  It is preferably from 0.05 weight % to 10 weight % for dust formulation, from 5 weight % to 60 weight % for wettable powder, from 5 weight % to 20 weight % for emulsifiable concentrate, from 5 weight % to 50 weight % for flowable formulation, and from 5 weight % to 50 weight % for dry flowable formulation. Further, the content of the adjuvant is from 0 weight % to 80 weight % and the content of the carrier is a quantity obtained by subtracting the total content of the active ingredient compound and the adjuvant from 100 weight %.<br>
As the application methods of the composition for preventing plant diseases of the present invention, there can be exemplified, for example, seed treatment, dipping treatment, nursery bed treatment, foliar application, soil drench, soil incorporation and the like. Various application methods that<br><br>
are usually employed by those skilled in the art can also be cited. The composition of the present invention exhibits a sufficient control effect against plant diseases by any of the above methods.<br>
Furthermore, the application amount and concentration of the composition for preventing plant diseases according to the present invention vary depending on target crops, target diseases, frequency of occurrence of diseases, formulation of the compound, application method, various kinds of environmental conditions and the like. In case the composition of the present invention is treated, the amount of active ingredients is suitably from 50 g/ha to 1,000 g/ha and preferably from 100 g/ha to 500 g/ha. When the wettable powder, flowable formulation or emulsifiable concentrate is treated after diluting with water, the dilution is suitably from 200 times to 20,000 times and preferably from 500 to 5,000 times. Further, when the composition of the present invention is used as a seed disinfectant, the amount of the composition (a mixture of Component I and Component II) is from 0.001 to 50 g per 1 kg of a seed and preferably from 0.01 to 10 g per 1 kg of a seed.  The composition of the present invention can, of course, be used as a mixture with agricultural chemicals such as other fungicides, insecticides, acaricides, nematicides, herbicides, plant growth regulators and the like, soil conditioners or fertilizer materials and can also be obtained as a mixed formation with these chemicals.<br>

Test Example 1<br>
Control Test on Powdery Mildew of Cucumbers (EBI resistant strain)<br>
In a greenhouse, two seedlings of cucumbers (cultivar: sagami-hanjiro) were planted in a plastic pot having a diameter of 7 . 5 cm and grown until 1.5 leaf stage. The wettable powder which was prepared according to Formulation Example al was diluted with water to the prescribed concentration and treated by 50 ml portions per four pots using a spray gun.  After a liquid chemical was dried, the leaves of cucumbers which were previously arranged to be damaged by the pathogen were uniformly wiped with powdery mildew pathogen (EBI resistant strain) thereon using a paintbrush for inoculation. After the<br><br>
inoculation, the plastic pot was put into a homoiothermal<br>
chamber (20°C to 25°C) in the greenhouse and taken out therefrom after 14 days have passed to carry out the examination.  The area ratio occupied by lesion per one leaf of cucumber was examined in accordance with the following severity index. Furthermore, the control value was calculated according to the following equation from the average severity of each plot. At the same time, the same tests were carried for Comparative Formulation Examples (formulation containing only one of active ingredient) such as Formulation Example a 1-2 and Formulation Example a 1-3.  The results are shown in Table I. Disease severity     0:  No lesion<br>
1:  Lesion area was not more than 5 % 2:  Lesion area was 6 - 25 % 3:  Lesion area was 26 - 50 % 4:  Lesion area was not less than 51 %<br>
The mean value of each treated plot and untreated plot was defined as disease severity.  The control value was calculated in the following manner.<br>
Control Value = (1 - disease severity in the treated plot / disease severity in the untreated plot) x 100 [Table 1] Table 1  Control Test on Powdery Mildew of Cucumbers<br><br>
(Table Removed) <br>
Test Example 2<br>
Control Test on Powdery Mildew of Wheat (EBI resistant) In a greenhouse, wheat (cultivar: chihoku, about 20 stocks/pot) was grown in a plastic pot having a diameter of 7.5 cm until the 1.5 leaf stage.

Test Example 4<br>
Control Test on Gray Mold of Tomato at its Flowering Stage [gray mold: RS strain)<br>
In a greenhouse, tomatoes (cultivar: House-Momotaro)<br>
were grown in a l/5000a Wagner's pot until the flowering stage. The wettable powder which was prepared according to Formulation Example al was diluted to the prescribed concentration and treated by 150 ml portions per four pots using a spray gun twice at an interval of one week.  At the same time, the wettable powders according to Comparative Formulation Examples (formulation containing only one of active ingredient) such as Formulation Example a 1-2 and Formulation Example a 1-3 were treated in the same manner. Conidiospore suspension was prepared from gray mold fungus (MBC resistant, dicarboximide-based chemical sensitive: RS strain) which was previously cultured on a PDA medium.  After one day from the treatment of the chemical, a conidiospore suspension containing the culture fluid was spray-inoculated mainly over the flower part twice at an interval of one week. After the inoculation, the Wagner's pot was put into a moist chamber at a temperature of from 15°C to 30°C under humidity of not less than 90% in the greenhouse and taken out therefrom after 7 days have passed to carry out the examination. Diseased fruit ratio (the ratio of diseased young fruits occupied by the total number of tomato young fruits) of each pot was examined.  The mean of diseased fruit ratio of each treated plot was obtained and the control value was calculated in the following manner.  The results are shown in Table 4.<br>
Control Value = (1 -diseased fruit ratio in the treated plot / diseased fruit ratio in the untreated plot) x 100<br>
