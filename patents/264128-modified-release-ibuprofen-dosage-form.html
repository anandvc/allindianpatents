CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
The present invention claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Applications Nos. 60/614,932, filed September 30, 2004 and 60/689,631,<br>
filed June 10, 2005, and U.S. Non-Provisional Application No. (TO BE<br>
ASSIGNED), filed September 29, 2005.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Ibuprofen is 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propionic acid and is a nonsteroidal<br>
anti-inflammatory compound (NSAID), which exhibits high levels of<br>
anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic activities necessary for the<br>
effective treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and osteo-arthritis and other<br>
inflammatory conditions. Most dosage forms of ibuprofen are immediate<br>
release dosage forms that provide rapid onset of therapeutic action, then<br>
rapidly declining levels of active ingredient, necessitating repeated dosing.<br>
They do not maintain therapeutic levels from one treatment over an extended<br>
period of time. Repeat dosing is thus required at intervals of four to six<br>
hours. Formulations that claim extended release fail to have an initial burst of<br>
the drug and thus exhibit substantial delay between administration and the<br>
achievement of an effective therapeutic blood level. Therefore, a need exists<br>
for a solid dosage form, for example a compressed tablet, which provides an<br>
initial burst of released ibuprofen, leading to prompt onset of action, then<br>
thereafter provides a sustained release of sufficient ibuprofen to maintain<br>
beneficial blood levels of ibuprofen over an extended period of 8 or more<br>
hours.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the foregoing, we have provided a solid<br>
dosage form for oral administration of ibuprofen comprising a modified<br>
release formulation of ibuprofen which provides an immediate burst effect and<br>
thereafter a sustained release of sufficient ibuprofen to maintain blood levels<br>
at least 6.4 μg/ml over an extended period of at least 8 hours following<br>
administration of a single dose.<br>
More particularly, the invention comprises a solid dosage form<br>
for oral administration comprising a hydrophilic polymer, a pharmaceutically<br>
effective amount of ibuprofen in the range of 300 mg to 800 mg uniformly<br>
dispersed in the polymer, a dissolution additive dispersed in the polymer in an<br>
amount iti the range of 10% to 35% by weight of the ibuprofen, and a<br>
formulation additive dispersed in the polymer in an amount of 15% to 75% by<br>
weight of the ibuprofen. The dosage form releases ibuprofen at a rate<br>
sufficient to initially deliver a effective amount of ibuprofen within about 2.0<br>
hours following administration. The dosage form then subsequently delivers<br>
the remaining amount of ibuprofen at a relatively constant rate sufficient to<br>
maintain a level of ibuprofen over a predetermined delivery period of for at<br>
least 8 hours.<br>
As used herein, a relative constant rate refers to a substantially<br>
linear relationship shown in the examples following the initial burst (up to<br>
about 2 hours) between percentage released and elapsed time.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is further illustrated and described by<br>
reference to the following disclosure, examples and discussion below. In the<br>
examples and discussion which follow, the use of particular polymers,<br>
electrolytes, additives, fillers and tableting aids are provided by way of<br>
example only and are not intended to limit the scope of this invention.<br>
Although the invention is illustrated and described herein with reference to<br>
specific embodiments, the invention is not intended to be limited to the details<br>
shown. Rather, various modifications may be made in the details within the<br>
scope and range of equivalents of the claims and without departing from the<br>
invention.<br>
The ibuprofen content of the dosage form may be between in<br>
the range about 300 mg and about 800 mg per dosage unit, preferably about<br>
300, 400 or 600 ring per unit dosage form. Also contemplated is using<br>
prodrugs of ibuprofen such as ibuprofen-lysine and ibuprofen-arginine. If a<br>
smaller dosage form is desired, a single dose of ibuprofen may be divided<br>
between multiple, for example two to three, dosage units, such as tablets,<br>
which may be administered at substantially the same time. The dosage form<br>
may comprise from about 25% to about 75% by weight ibuprofen.<br>
The hydrophilic polymer used in the dosage form may be<br>
selected from a wide variety of hydrophilic polymers. Hydrophilic polymers<br>
suitable for use in the sustained release formulation include: one or more<br>
natural or partially or totally synthetic hydrophilic gums such as acacia, gum<br>
tragacanth, locust bean gum, guar gum, or karaya gum; modified cellulosic<br>
substances such as methylcellulose, hydroxy methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl<br>
methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, or<br>
carboxyethylcellulose; proteinaceous substances such as agar, pectin,<br>
carrageenan, and alginates; and other hydrophilic polymers such as<br>
carboxypolymethylene, gelatin, casein, zein, bentonite, magnesium aluminum<br>
silicate, polysaccharides, modified starch derivatives, and other hydrophilic<br>
polymers known to those of skill in the art, or a combination of such<br>
polymers.<br>
These hydrophilic polymers gel and dissolve slowly in aqueous<br>
acidic: media thereby allowing the ibuprofen to diffuse from the gel in the<br>
stomach and gastrointestinal tract. Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC)<br>
and other hydrophilic polymers mentioned above may be available in forms<br>
that have varying viscosity ratings. In general these polymers, or the<br>
combination of them, may be present in the dosage form alone or in<br>
combination in an amount or at a concentration in the range of 10% to 70%<br>
by weight of the ibuprofen present in the formulation, for example 15% to<br>
50% or 15% to 33%, depending on the release pattern which is sought to be<br>
achieved with the particular dosage form.<br>
One hydrophilic polymer useful in the present invention is HPMC<br>
K4M. This is a nonionic swellable hydrophilic polymer manufactured by "The<br>
Dow Chemical Company" under the tradename "Methocel." HPMC K4M is also<br>
referred to as HPMC K4MP, in which the "P" refers to premium cellulose ether<br>
designed for controlled release formulations. The "4" in the abbreviation<br>
suggests that the polymer has a nominal viscosity (2% in water) of 4000.<br>
The percent of methoxyl and hydroxypropyl groups are 19-24 and 7-12,<br>
respectively. In its physical form, HPMC K4M is a free-flowing, off-white<br>
powder with a particle size limitation of 90%
complete list of HPMC is K100LVP, K15MP, K100MP, E4MP and E10MP CR with<br>
nominal viscosities of 100, 15000, 100000, 4000, and 10000 respectively.<br>
The solid dosage form also includes at least one formulation<br>
additive such as one or more of a filler, a diluent or a compression aid. These<br>
are additives which aid in preparation or manufacture of the dosage form and<br>
for a tableted solid dosage form a tableting aid such as microcrystalline<br>
cellulose (MCC), such MCC 105 (particle size of about 20 |.im), MCC 200<br>
(particle size of about 180 urn) and MCC 302 (particle size of about 90 f.im),<br>
silicified microcrystalline cellulose (MCC bonded to SiO2), such as Prosolv90<br>
(particle size of about 90 j.im) and ProsolvSO (paricle size of about 50 |.im),<br>
lactose, such as spray dried lactose (Lactopress®), dicalcium phosphate, silica<br>
or pregelatinized starch and combinations thereof may be incorporated into<br>
the formulation in an amount or at a concentration in the range of about 15%<br>
to about 75% by weight of the ibuprofen present in the dosage form. It is<br>
contemplated that various particle sizes of microcrystalline cellulose may be<br>
used if desired, for example two different particle sizes in which each of them<br>
are present in individual amounts in the range of 17% to 33% by weight of<br>
the ibuprofen present in the formulation. In one embodiment, one can preblend<br>
silica with ibuprofen or pre-blend silica and/or formulation additive MCC<br>
with ibuprofen.<br>
In addition to formulation additives, the dosage form also<br>
contains at least one dissolution additive. Such additives which generally<br>
comprise a pore-forming, wetting or disintegration agent which facilitates<br>
dissolution of the dosage form. Such dissolution additives may be present in<br>
the dosage form at an amount or concentration in the range of about 10% to<br>
about 35% by weight of the ibuprofen, for example, at 10% to about 15%.<br>
The additive may suitably be selected from alkali metal salts, such as sodium<br>
and potassium carbonate; sodium carbonate, monohydrate; sodium<br>
bicarbonate; amino acids with neutral-to-basic side chains, such as glycine,<br>
alanine, valine, leucine, iso-leucine, cysteine, methionine, phenylalanine,<br>
proline, lysine, arginine, histidine, serine, threonine, asparagine, tryptophan,<br>
tyrosine and glutamine; conventional pharmaceutical disintegrants and<br>
combinations or mixtures thereof. Examples of such additives are sodium<br>
carbonate, glycine, arginine and croscarmellose sodium.<br>
In addition to ibuprofen, multiple active ingredients are<br>
contemplated and may be present in the present dosage form. Combinations<br>
of ibuprofen with actives such as caffeine, psuedophedrine, aspirin,<br>
phenylephrine and/or sympathomemetics, analgesics, such as hydrocodone,<br>
and antihistamines are within the scope of the invention.<br>
Favorable in vitro characteristics that lead to an acceptable in<br>
vivo efficacy are contemplated as 20% or greater release within 2.0 hour after<br>
oral administration or contact with an aqueous environment, followed by more<br>
gradual release over several hours, leading to release of at least 70% release<br>
in 8 to 12 hours following administration or contact with an aqueous<br>
environment. The method of determining in vitro release is using an agitated<br>
aqueous medium, such as stirring at 50 rpm in pH 7.2 KH2PO4 media; or<br>
surrogate methods using alternate pH media, such as 0.1N HCI or SGF @ pH<br>
1.2 for an initial (30min-2hr period or using alternate hydrodynamic<br>
conditions such as 100 to I5Orpm for a period of l-2hrs).<br>
The accepted range for minimal efficacy in vivo is from about<br>
6.4 μg/ml to about 10μg/ml mean ibuprofen blood concentration.<br>
Examples<br>
The formulations of the invention are illustrated by the following<br>
examples. The use of particular polymers, electrolytes, additives, fillers and<br>
compression aids are not intended to limit the scope of this invention but are<br>
exemplary only.<br>
The solid dosage comprising a modified release formulation of<br>
the present invention was prepared and tested for both in vitro release and in<br>
vivo blood levels as described in Examples 1-20 below. In the in vivo testing,<br>
the dissolution rates of the subject dosage forms were compared against two<br>
commercially available tablets, one being an immediate release formulation of<br>
200 mg of ibuprofen and the other being an immediate release 600 mg<br>
ibuprofen formulation. The solid dosage forms comprising the modified<br>
release formulation of the present invention demonstrated an initial burst<br>
similar to an immediate release tablet and a slower, more controlled release<br>
of ibuprofen over a eight hour period, as best seen in Fig. 19.<br>
Unless otherwise noted, all in vitro release performance was<br>
evaluated in a type II dissolution apparatus in 900mL KH2P04 buffer, pH 7.2,<br>
at5Orpm paddle speed,<br>
Example 1<br>
In one embodiment, the formulation comprised ibuprofen,<br>
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC K15M and HPMC K100LV), glycine and<br>
sodium carbonate, in which HPMC K15M was present at a concentration of<br>
18% by weight of ibuprofen, HPMC K100LV was present at a concentration of<br>
17% by weight of ibuprofen, glycine was present at a concentration of 2.5%<br>
by weight of ibuprofen, and sodium carbonate was present at a concentration<br>
of 17% by weight of ibuprofen within a monolithic compressed tablet. The<br>
specific formulations are as follows:<br>
All Ingredients were passed through a 30-mesh screen and<br>
blended with the remaining formulation components in a V-blender. The<br>
resulting powder was compressed into tablets using conventional compression<br>
techniques.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, the results of this Example demonstrate<br>
that the invention is capable of an in vitro release profile comprising a burst<br>
effect, followed by the sustained release of the remaining material, leading to<br>
in excess of 90% release in approximately 12 hours. This formulation thus<br>
overcomes one of the principle problems with many ibuprofen formulations<br>
which exhibit substantially less than complete release over an extended<br>
period of time.<br>
Example 2<br>
In another embodiment, the formulation comprised ibuprofen,<br>
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC K100M and HPMC K100LV), sodium<br>
carbonate, flow agents and tableting aids, in which HPMC K100M was present<br>
at a concentration of 17% by weight of ibuprofen, HPMC K100LV was present<br>
at a concentration of 17% by weight of ibuprofen and sodium carbonate was<br>
present at a concentration of 25% by weight of ibuprofen within a compressed<br>
monolithic tablet. The specific formula is as follows:<br>
Ex. 2<br>
Ibuprofen<br>
The formulation components were mixed in a V-blender. The<br>
resulting powder was compressed into tablets using conventional<br>
technologies. In this Example a combination of a medium to high viscosity<br>
HPMC and a low viscosity HPMC was used.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, the results of this Example demonstrate an<br>
in vitro release profile comprising a burst effect, followed by the sustained<br>
release of the remaining material. The burst effect provides release of 20% of<br>
ibuprofen within 2 hours, and the release of approximately 90% of the<br>
available ibuprofen over a period of 12 to 14 hours.<br>
Exarne!e_3<br>
In another embodiment, the formulation comprised ibuprofen,<br>
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC K15M and HPMC KIOOLV), sodium<br>
carbonate, flow agents and tableting aids, in which HPMC K100M was present<br>
at a concentration of 17% by weight of ibuprofen, HPMC KIOOLV was present<br>
at a concentration of 17% by weight of ibuprofen and sodium carbonate was<br>
present at a concentration of 25% by weight of ibuprofen within a compressed<br>
monolithic tablet.<br>
The formulation components were mixed in a V-blender. The<br>
resulting powder was compressed into tablets using conventional compression<br>
technology. In this Example a combination of a medium to high viscosity<br>
HPMC and a low viscosity HPMC was used.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, the results of this Example demonstrate an<br>
in vitro release profile comprising a burst effect providing release of 20% of<br>
ibuprofen within 2 hours, followed by the sustained release of the remaining<br>
material evidencing release of 100% of the ibuprofen present in about 11<br>
hours and greater than 90% in approximately 8 hours.<br>
Example 4<br>
In another embodiment, the formulation comprised ibuprofen,<br>
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC K100M and HPMC K100LV), sodium<br>
carbonate, flow agents and tableting aids, in which HPMC K100M was present<br>
at a concentration of 17% by weight of ibuprofen, HPMC K100LV was present<br>
at a concentration of 17% by weight of ibuprofen, and sodium carbonate was<br>
present at a concentration of 25% by weight of ibuprofen within a compressed<br>
monolithic tablet.<br>
The formulation components were mixed in a V-blender. The<br>
resulting powder was compressed into tablets using conventional<br>
technologies. In this Example a combination of a medium to high viscosity<br>
HPMC and a low viscosity HPMC was used.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, the results of this Example demonstrate an<br>
in vitro release profile comprising a burst effect, followed by the sustained<br>
release of the remaining material. 20% of ibuprofen was released within 2<br>
10<br>
hours, followed by gradual sustained release, resulting in approximately 95%<br>
release after 12 hours,<br>
Example 5<br>
In another embodiment, the formulation comprised ibuprofen,<br>
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC K100M), polyethylene oxide (PEO<br>
WSRN 301), sodium carbonate, glycine, flow agents and tableting aids, in<br>
which HPMC was present at a concentration of 33% by weight of ibuprofen,<br>
glycine was present at a concentration of 8.25% by weight of ibuprofen and<br>
sodium carbonate was present at a concentration of 25% by weight of<br>
ibuprofen within a compressed monolithic tablet.<br>
Ibuprofen<br>
The formulation components were mixed in a V-blender. The<br>
resulting powder was compressed into tablets using conventional compression<br>
technology.<br>
As shown in Fig. 6, the results of this Example demonstrate an<br>
in vitro release profile comprising a burst effect, followed by the sustained<br>
release of the remaining material. 20% of ibuprofen was released in under 2<br>
hours, and release was thereafter sustained over a period of 15 hours.<br>
However, incomplete release was exhibited by the dosage form.<br>
Example 7<br>
In this embodiment, the formulation comprised ibuprofen,<br>
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC K15M), sodium carbonate,<br>
microcrystalline cellulose (MCC PH105 and MCC PH200), in which HPMC was<br>
present at a concentration of 33% by weight of ibuprofen, sodium carbonate<br>
was present at a concentration of 17% by weight of ibuprofen, MCC PH105<br>
was present at a concentration of 33%, and MCC PH200 was present at a<br>
concentration of 17% within a compressed monolithic tablet.<br>
All ingredients were passed through a 30-mesh screen. The<br>
ibuprofen and the MCC 105 were blended in a V-blender. The resulting<br>
homogenous pre-blend was granulated with water, dried and subsequently<br>
12<br>
blended with the remaining formulation components in a V-blender. The<br>
resulting powder was compressed into tablets using conventional compression<br>
technology.<br>
As shown in Fig. 7, this Example demonstrates an in vitro<br>
release profile comprising a burst effect, followed by the sustained release of<br>
the remaining material. The burst effect releases 20% of ibuprofen in under 2<br>
hour, followed by relatively constant release over the next 10 -12 hours and<br>
resulting in approximately 90% release after 12 hours.<br>
Example 8<br>
In the embodiment of Example 1, the tablet resulting from the<br>
formulation was split into two equal parts, and both sections were placed into<br>
a dissolution vessel.<br>
As shown in Fig. 8, the results of this Example demonstrates an<br>
in vitro release profile comprising a burst effect, followed by the sustained<br>
release of the remaining material, even when split into sections after<br>
tableting. In each case 20% of ibuprofen was released in less than one hour<br>
and substantially all the ibuprofen had been released at about 12 hours.<br>
Example 9<br>
In one embodiment, the formulation comprised ibuprofen,<br>
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC K15M), sodium carbonate,<br>
microcrystalline cellulose (MCC PH 302), in which HPMC was present at a<br>
concentration of 33% by weight of ibuprofen, sodium carbonate was present<br>
at a concentration of 18% by weight of ibuprofen, and MCC PH 302 was<br>
present at a concentration of 33% within a compressed monolithic tablet.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
All ingredients were passed through a 30-mesh screen and<br>
blended in a V-blender. The resulting homogenous pre-blend was granulated<br>
with water, dried and subsequently blended with the remaining formulation<br>
components in a V-blender. The resulting powder was compressed into<br>
tablets using conventional technologies.<br>
As shown in Fig. 9, the results of this Example demonstrate an<br>
in vitro release profile comprising a burst effect, followed by the sustained<br>
release of the remaining material. 20% of ibuprofen was released within 2<br>
hours, about 90% release was obtained in about 9 hours followed by 100%<br>
release in under 16 hours.<br>
Example 10<br>
In another embodiment, the formulation comprised ibuprofen,<br>
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC K4M), flow agents and tableting aids, in<br>
which HPMC K4M was present at a concentration of 32% by weight of<br>
ibuprofen, and arginine was present at a concentration of 17% by weight of<br>
ibuprofen within a compressed monolithic tablet.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The formulation components were mixed in a V-blender. The<br>
resulting powder was compressed into tablets using conventional<br>
technologies.<br>
As shown in Fig. 10, the results of this Example demonstrate<br>
an in vitro release profile comprising a slight burst effect, followed by the<br>
sustained release of the remaining material. While the burst effect in this<br>
formulation produces somewhat delayed achievement of the percentage<br>
released, this formulation demonstrates in excess of 90% release over a<br>
period of 8 hours.<br>
Example 11<br>
In another embodiment, the formulation comprised ibuprofen,<br>
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC K4M), sodium carbonate, arginine, flow<br>

Comparative in vitro data<br>
BRUFEN RETARD is a commercially available in Europe as a<br>
sustained release formulation of ibuprofen. BRUFEN RETARD tablets are<br>
specially formulated to allow the gradual release of active substance giving<br>
stable levels and a prolonged duration of effect over the dosage interval.<br>
BRUFEN RETARD is a film coated tablet with 8OOmg of ibuprofen. BRUFEN<br>
RETARD is indicated for its analgesic and anti-inflammatory effect in the<br>
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (including juvenile rheumatoid arthritis or<br>
Still's disease), ankylosmg spondylitis, and osteo-arthritis. BRUFEN RETARD is<br>
indicated in the treatment of non-articular rheumatism including fibrositis.<br>
BRUFEN RETARD is indicated in periarticular conditions such as frozen<br>
shoulder (capsulitis), bursitis, tendinitis, tenosynovitis and low-back pain.<br>
BRUFEN RETARD can also be used in soft-tissue injuries such as sprains and<br>
strains. BRUFEN RETARD is also indicated for its analgesic effect in the relief<br>
of mild to moderate pain such as dysmenorrhoea, dental, post-episiotomy<br>
pain and post-partum pain.<br>
Example 19 (Figure 18)<br>
BRUFEN RETARD tablet in vitro release performance was<br>
evaluated in a type II dissolution apparatus in 900mL KH2PO4 buffer, pH 7.2,<br>
at SOrpm paddle speed. As shown in Fig. 18, the results of this Example<br>
demonstrate the in vitro data results of BRUFEN RETARD. The figure shows<br>
that BRUFEN RETARD is incapable of an in vitro release profile comprising a<br>
burst effect, followed by the sustained release of the remaining material.<br>
BRUFEN RETARD fails to deliver to release at least 20% of ibuprofen by 2.0<br>
hours with a constant rate of release with at least 70% release at 14 hours.<br>
Example 20 - In Vivo Trial<br>
In the in vivo testing, serum concentrations of subjects taking<br>
tablets comprising the modified release formulation of the present invention<br>
were compared with serum concentrations of subjects taking immediate<br>
release ibuprofen tablets (Motrin® IB 200 mg and Motrin® 600 mg). Tablets<br>
comprising the modified release formulation of the present invention<br>
demonstrated a burst effect followed by sustained release and therapeutic<br>
concentration at extended time periods that the other two immediate release<br>
formulations did not. The minimum mean serum plasma ibuprofen<br>
concentration in the blood of the subject was between 8 and 10|ag/ml for<br>
Motrin"" IB..<br>
The in vivo behavior of modified release solid dosages of la and<br>
1b from Example 1 were compared to the in vivo behavior of an immediate<br>
release formulation (MOTRIN®). The open-label study involved 10 healthy<br>
male volunteers over the age of 18. Following an overnight fast of at least<br>
ten hours, each subject received either one 600 mg dose of one of the two<br>
above described modified release tablets or 200 mg every four hours for 3<br>
doses of the immediate release formulation of MOTRIN® IB or one 600 mg<br>
tablet of MOTRIN®. 88 blood samples were taken prior to dosing and at<br>
specific intervals up to 12 hours after dosing.<br>
The blood samples were kept in ice bath prior to centrifugation<br>
and were centrifuge as soon as possible under refrigerated condition at 35000<br>
rpm for seven minutes. The collected plasma from each blood collection tube<br>
was aliquotted into pre-cooled labeled polypropylene tubes. The samples<br>
were kept in an ice bath, then stored frozen at minus 25 °C ±10 °C until<br>
assayed.<br>
The plasma samples were analyzed by a fully validated HPLC<br>
method. The analytes were separated by reverse phase chromatography.<br>
Evaluation of the assay was carried out by the construction of an eight point<br>
calibration curve (excluding zero concentration) covering the range of 0.400<br>
μg/ml to 51.200 μg/ml (in human plasma) for ibuprofen. The slope and<br>
intercept of the calibration curves were determined through weighted linear<br>
regression analysis (1/conc.2). The results are depicted in FIGURE 19.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Treatments (B &amp; C) versus Treatment E<br>
The systematic exposure to ibuprofen after the administration<br>
of the one 600 mg ibuprofen tablet la or Ib (Treatments B &amp; C) was similar<br>
to that obtained when compared to the administration of one MOTRIN®<br>
600mg tablet. The peak exposure to ibuprofen from one 600 mg ibuprofen<br>
tablet la or Ib (Treatments A-C) was significantly lower than that from the<br>
MOTRIN"* GOOmg tablet. The absorption time was modified comparing one<br>
600 mg ibuprofen tablet la or Ib (Treatments B &amp; C) with median Tmax value<br>
of 5.Oh to a 1.5h Tmax of one MOTRIN® 600mg tablet.<br>
Treatments (B &amp; C) versus Treatment D<br>
The systematic exposure to ibuprofen after the administration<br>
of the one 600 mg ibuprofen tablet la or Ib (Treatments B &amp; C) was similar<br>
to that obtained when compared to the administration of three MOTRIN® IB<br>
200mg tablets. The peak exposure to ibuprofen from one 600 mg ibuprofen<br>
tablet la or Ib (Treatments B &amp; C) was significantly lower than that from<br>
three MOTRIN® IB 200mg tablets. The absorption time was modified<br>
comparing one 600 mg ibuprofen tablet la or Ib (Treatments B &amp; C) with<br>
median Tmax value of 5.Oh to a l.Oh Tmaxof three MOTRIN® IB 200mg tablet.<br>
Figure 19 depicts the results discussed above. Treatment D<br>
shows an initial burst that falls to a valley at four hours and the second tablet<br>
is administered. This valley again happens at the eighth hour. This valley<br>
constitutes the minimum plasma concentration for ibuprofen to be considered<br>
therapeutic. A mean ibuprofen plasma concentration of about 6.4-10 μg/ml is<br>
considered the concentration of ibuprofen needed in the blood to be<br>
considered clinically effective. Treatment E shows an extreme initial burst of<br>
ibuprofen followed by a steady decline that falls below therapeutic threshold<br>
at about 6 hours.<br>
Treatments B and C have an initial burst of ibuprofen that<br>
reaches the level of 6.4 μg/ml at about 0.5 to 1 hour and maintains the level<br>
until about hour 12. The present invention provides for a single dosage of<br>
ibuprofen that provides an initial burst similar to an immediate release<br>
formulation of ibuprofen and then provides a mean ibuprofen plasma<br>
concentration of above 6.4μg/ml for about 12 hours.<br><br><br><br><br>
