				<td>BICYCLIC PYRIMIDINONES AND USES THEREOF FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel bicyclic pyrimidinone compounds and analogues thereof for the treatment of viral infections, particularly HIV infections.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The retrovirus designated "human immunodeficiency virus" or "HIV" is the etiological agent of a complex disease that progressively destroys the immune system. This disease is known as acquired immune deficiency syndrome or AIDS. As at December 2005 an estimated 40 million people are living with HIV world wide and over 3 million deaths are occurring annually.<br>
A feature of retrovirus replication includes the reverse transcription of the viral genome into proviral DNA and its integration into the host cell genome. These steps are required for HIV replication and are mediated by the virus encoded enzymes, reverse transcriptase and integrase respectively.<br>
HIV infection follows a path of the virus particle binding to cell surface receptors and co-receptors resulting in fusion of the virus particle with the cell. The contents of the virus are released into the cytoplasm where reverse transcription of the HIV genome occurs. Through a series of steps a double stranded proviral DNA copy is produced. The proviral DNA is transported to the nucleus in a complex known as the pre integration complex (PIC) which contains integrase and other viral and possibly cellular proteins. Once inside the nucleus the proviral DNA is integrated into the host cell genome via the action of integrase. Once integrated, transcription and translation of the viral genome can occur resulting in the production of viral proteins and a new viral RNA genome. These proteins and genome assemble at the cell surface and, depending on cell type, possibly other intracellular membranous compartments. Assembled particles then bud out from the cell and during, or soon after, this process mature into infectious HIV particles through the action of the viral protease.<br>
The integration of the proviral genome into the host cell genome requires the action of an integrase which carries out this process in at least three steps, possibly four. The first step involves the assembly of the viral genome into a stable nucleoprotein complex, secondly, processing of two nucleotides from the 3' termini of the genome to give<br><br>
staggered ends with free 3' OH residues and thirdly the transfer of these ends into the host cell genome. The final step involves the gap filling and repair of the insertion site in the host genome. There is still some conjecture over whether the integrase performs this final step or whether it is carried out by cellular repair enzymes.<br>
Currently HIV infection can be treated with a number of inhibitors on the market which target reverse transcriptase, protease or entry into the cell. Treatment of HIV infection with these, or a combination of these, drugs is known to be an effective treatment for AIDS and similar diseases. Shortcomings with the current inhibitors include the rapid emergence and increase incidence of resistance and numerous side effects and hence there is a need for new classes of inhibitors targeting proteins such as integrase.<br>

In a second aspect, the present invention provides a method of treatment or prophylaxis of a viral infection in a subject comprising administering to said subject an effective amount of a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative, salt or prodrug thereof.<br>
In a uiird aspect, there is provided the use of a compound of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative, salt or prodrug thereof in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment or prophylaxis of a viral infection in a subject.<br><br>
Preferably, the viral infection of the second and third aspects is a HIV or SIV infection.<br>
More preferably, the HIV or SIV infection comprises a viral strain resistant to other integrase inhibitors. Even more preferably, the viral strain comprises HIV integrase enzyme with the Q148K mutation. Certain of the compounds of the present invention have been shown to have surprisingly higher activity against a HIV integrase enzyme (Q148K) that is resistant to published integrase inhibitors such as S-1360, Raltegravir (Merck MK-0518) and GS9137 (Gilead GS-9137). A compound showing particularly high activity against Q148K is the compound of Example 6.13 (see Figure 1).<br>
An Example of a literature references to the resistance profiles of Q148K can be found in the 14th CROI (Conference on Retroviral and Opportunistic Infections), Los Angeles, February 27th 2007 from John Wai, Merck Research Labs, 'Next generation inhibitors of HIV-1 Integrase Strand Transfer: Structural diversity and resistance profiles.<br>
As used herein, the term "halo" or "halogen" refers to fluorine (fluoro), chlorine (chloro), bromine (bromo) or iodine (iodo).<br>
As used herein, the term "alkyl" either used alone or in compound terms such as NH(alkyl) or N(alkyl)2, refers to monovalent straight chain or branched hydrocarbon groups, having 1 to 3, 1 to 6, or 1 to 10 carbon atoms as appropriate. For example, suitable alkyl groups include, but are not limited to methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, pentyl, 2-methylbutyl, 3-methylbutyl, n-hexyl, 2-, 3- or 4-methylpentyl, 2-ethylbutyl, n-hexyl or 2-, 3-, 4- or 5-methylpentyl.<br>
As used herein, the term "alkenyl" refers to a straight chain or branched hydrocarbon groups having one or more double bonds between carbon atoms. Suitable alkenyl groups include, but are not limited to, ethenyl, allyl, propenyl, iso-propenyl, butenyl, pentenyl and hexenyl.<br>
The term "cycloalkyl" as used herein, refers to cyclic hydrocarbon groups. Suitable cycloalkyl groups include, but are not limited to cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl.<br>
The term "aryl" as used herein, refers to a C6-C10 aromatic hydrocarbon group, for example phenyl or naphthyl.<br>
The term "alkylaryl" includes, for example, benzyl.<br><br>
The term "heterocycle" when used alone or in compound words includes monocyclic, polycyclic, fused or conjugated hydrocarbon residues, preferably C3.6, wherein one or more carbon atoms (and where appropriate, hydrogen atoms attached thereto) are replaced by a heteroatom so as to provide a non-aromatic residue. The bonds between atoms may be saturated or unsaturated. Suitable heteroatoms include, O, N and S. Where two or more carbon atoms are replaced, this may be by two or more of the same heteroatom or by different heteroatoms. Suitable examples of heterocyclic groups may include pyrrolidinyl, piperidyl, piperazinyl, morpholino, quinolinyl, isoquinolinyl, thiomorpholino, dioxanyl, 2,2'-dimethyl-[l,3]-dioxolanyl, tetrahydrofuranyl, tetrahydropyranyl, tetrahydropyrrolyl etc.<br>
The term "heteroaryl" includes a 5- or 6-membered heteroaromatic ring containing one or more heteroatoms selected from O, N and S. Suitable Examples of heteroaryl groups include furanyl, thiophenyl, tetrazolyl, 1,2,3-triazolyl, 1,2,4-triazolyl, imidazolyl, pyrazolyl, pyridinyl, pyrimidinyl, oxazolyl, oxadiazolyl, thioazolyl, thiodiazolyl etc. The heteroaromatic ring may be fused to a 5- or 6-membered aromatic or heteroaromatic ring to form a bicyclic aromatic ring system eg benzofuran.<br>
Unless otherwise stated, each alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkylaryl, aryl, heterocyclyl, or heteroaryl group may be optionally substituted with one or more of C1-C3alkyl, C3-C6cycloalkyl, C6aryl, heterocyclyl, heteroaryl, C1-C3alkylOH, alkylaryl, OH, OC1,-C3alkyl, halo, CN, NO2, CO2H, CO2C,.C3alkyl, CONH2, CONH(C1-C3alkyl), CON(C1-C3alkyl)2, trifluoromethyl, NH2, NH(C1-C3alkyl) or N(C1-C3alkyl)2. For example, an optionally substituted aryl group may be 4-methylphenyl or 4-hydroxyphenyl group, and an optionally substituted alkyl group may be 2-hydroxyethyl, trifluoromethyl, or difluoromethyl. Each optional alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkylaryl, aryl, heterocyclyl, or heteroaryl substituent may also be optionally substituted.<br>
Examples of optional substituents also include suitable nitrogen protecting groups (see "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis" Theodora Greene and Peter Wuts, third edition, Wiley Interscience, 1999).<br>
The salts of the compound of formula I are preferably pharmaceutically acceptable, but it will be appreciated that non-pharmaceutically acceptable salts also fall within the scope of the present invention, since these are useful as intermediates in the preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br><br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable derivative" may include any pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate or prodrug, or any other compound which upon administration to a subject, is capable of providing (directly or indirectly) a compound of formula I or an antibacterially active metabolite or residue thereof.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, salts of pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, sulphuric, phosphoric, nitric, carbonic, boric, sulfamic, and hydrobromic acids, or salts of pharmaceutically acceptable organic acids such as acetic, propionic, butyric, tartaric, maleic, hydroxymaleic, fumaric, malic, citric, lactic, mucic, gluconic, benzoic, succinic, oxalic, phenylacetic, methanesulphonic, toluenesulphonic, benzenesulphonic, salicylic, sulphanilic, aspartic, glutamic, edetic, stearic, palmitic, oleic, lauric, pantothenic, tannic, ascorbic and valeric acids.<br>
Base salts include, but are not limited to, those formed with pharmaceutically acceptable cations, such as sodium, potassium, lithium, calcium, magnesium, zinc, ammonium, alkylammonium such as salts formed from triethylamine, alkoxyammonium such as those formed with ethanolamine and salts formed from ethylenediamine, choline or amino acids such as arginine, lysine or histidine. General information on types of pharmaceutically acceptable salts and their formation is known to those skilled in the art and is as described in general texts such as "Handbook of Pharmaceutical salts" P.H.Stahl, C.G.Wermuth, 1st edition, 2002, Wiley-VCH.<br>
Basic nitrogen-containing groups may be quarternised with such agents as lower alkyl halide, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl chlorides, bromides and iodides; dialkyl sulfates like dimethyl and diethyl sulfate; and others.<br>
Hydroxyl groups may be esterified with groups including lower alkyl carboxylic acids, such as acetic acid and 2,2-dimethylpropionic acid, or sulfonated with groups including alkyl sulfonic acids, such as methyl sulfonic acid (see, for instance the compound of Example 15.10).<br>
This invention also encompasses pharmaceutical compositions containing prodrugs of compounds of formula I. This invention also encompasses methods of treating or preventing a viral infection in a subject by administering prodrugs of compounds of the formula I. Compounds of formula I having free amino, amido, hydroxy or carboxylic groups can be converted into prodrugs.<br><br>
Prodrugs include compounds wherein an amino acid residue, or a polypeptide chain of two or more (eg, two, three or four) amino acid residues which are covalently joined to free amino, hydroxy and carboxylic acid groups of compounds of formula I. The amino acid residues include the 20 naturally occurring amino acids commonly designated by three letter symbols and also include, 4-hydroxyproline, hydroxylysine, demosine, isodemosine, 3-methylhistidine, norvlin, beta-alanine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, citrulline, homocysteine, homoserine, ornithine and methionine sulfone. Prodrugs also include compounds wherein carbonates, carbamates, amides and alkyl esters which are covalently bonded to the above substituents of formula I through the carbonyl carbon prodrug sidechain. Prodrugs also include phosphate derivatives of compounds of formula I (such as acids, salts of acids, or esters) joined through a phosphorus-oxygen bond to a free hydroxyl of compounds of formula I.<br>
It will also be recognised that the compounds of formula I may possess asymmetric centres and are therefore capable of existing in more than one stereoisomeric form. The invention thus also relates to compounds in substantially pure isomeric form at one or more asymmetric centres eg., greater than about 90% ee, such as about 95% or 97% ee or greater than 99% ee, as well as mixtures, including racemic mixtures, thereof. Such isomers may be prepared by asymmetric synmesis, for example using chiral intermediates, or by chiral resolution.<br>
In a fourth aspect, the present invention provides pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound according to the first aspect and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient.<br>
The compositions of the present invention may contain other therapeutic agents as described below, and may be formulated, for example, by employing conventional solid or liquid vehicles or diluents, as well as pharmaceutical additives of a type appropriate to the mode of desired administration (for example, excipients, binders, preservatives, stabilizers, flavors, etc.) according to techniques such as those well known in die art of pharmaceutical formulation.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be administered by any suitable means, for example, parenterally, such as by subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, or intracisternal injection or infusion techniques (e.g., as sterile injectable aqueous or non-aqueous solutions or suspensions).<br><br>
Pharmaceutical formulations include those for oral, rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal and sub-lingual), vaginal or parenteral (including intramuscular, sub-cutaneous and intravenous) administration or in a form suitable for administration by inhalation or insufflation. The compounds of the invention, together with a conventional adjuvant, carrier or diluent, may thus be placed into the form of pharmaceutical compositions and unit dosages thereof, and in such form may be employed as solids, such as tablets or filled capsules, or liquids as solutions, suspensions, emulsions, elixirs or capsules filled with the same, all for oral use, in the form of suppositories for rectal administration; or in the form of sterile injectable solutions for parenteral (including subcutaneous) use.<br>
In addition to primates, such as humans, a variety of other mammals can be treated according to the method of the present invention. For instance, mammals including, but not limited to, cows, sheep, goats, horses, dogs, cats, guinea pigs, rats or other bovine, ovine, equine, canine, feline, rodent or murine species can be treated. However, the method can also be practiced in other species, such as avian species (e.g., chickens).<br>
The subjects treated in the above method are mammals, including, but not limited to, cows, sheep, goats, horses, dogs, cats, guinea pigs, rats or other bovine, ovine, equine, canine, feline, rodent or murine species, and preferably a human being, male or female.<br>
The term " effective amount" means the amount of the subject composition that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue, system, animal or human that is being sought by the researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician.<br>
As would be understood by those skilled in the art of treating viral infections, and particularly HIV infections, the term "treatment" does not necessarily mean that the viral infection is completely cured. The term "treatment" encompasses any reduction in the viral load and/or inhibition of replication in the subject being treated.<br>
The term "composition" as used herein is intended to encompass a product comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination of the specified ingredients in the specified amounts. By "pharmaceutically acceptable" it is meant the carrier, diluent or excipient must be compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof.<br><br>
The terms "administration of and or "administering a" compound should be understood to mean providing a compound of the invention to the individual in need of treatment.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions for the administration of the compounds of this invention may conveniently be presented in dosage unit form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. All methods include the step of bringing the active ingredient into association with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the pharmaceutical compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing the active ingredient into association with a liquid carrier or a finely divided solid carrier or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired formulation. In the pharmaceutical composition the active object compound is included in an amount sufficient to produce the desired effect upon the process or condition of diseases. As used herein, the term "composition" is intended to encompass a product comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination of the specified ingredients in the specified amounts.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butane diol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition and method of the present invention may further comprise other therapeutically active compounds which are usually applied in the treatment of the above mentioned pathological conditions. Selection of the appropriate agents for use in combination therapy may be made by one of ordinary skill in the art, according to conventional pharmaceutical principles. The combination of therapeutic agents may act synergistically to effect the treatment or prevention of the various disorders described above. Using this approach, one may be able to achieve therapeutic<br><br>
efficacy with lower dosages of each agent, thus reducing the potential for adverse side effects.<br>
When other therapeutic agents are employed in combination with the compounds of the present invention they may be used for example in amounts as noted in the Physician Desk Reference (PDR) or as otherwise determined by one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
In the treatment or prevention of conditions which require HIV inhibition or HIV integrase enzyme inhibition an appropriate dosage level will generally be about 0.01 to 500 mg per kg patient body weight per day which can be administered in single or multiple doses. Preferably, the dosage level will be about 0.1 to about 250 mg/kg per day; more preferably about 0.5 to about 100 mg/kg per day. A suitable dosage level may be about 0.01 to 250 mg/kg per day, about 0.05 to 100 mg/kg per day, or about 0.1 to 50 mg/kg per day. Within this range the dosage may be 0.05 to 0.5, 0..5 to 5 or 5 to 50 mg/kg per day. For oral administration, the compositions are preferably provided in the form of tablets containing 1.0 to 1000 milligrams of the active ingredient, particularly 1.0, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0. 20.0, 25.0, 50.0, 75.0, 100.0, 150.0, 200.0, 250.0, 300.0, 400.0, 500.0, 600.0, 750.0, 800.0, 900.0, and 1000.0 milligrams of the active ingredient for the symptomatic adjustment of the dosage to the patient to be treated. The compounds may be administered on a regimen of 1 to 4 times per day, preferably once or twice per day.<br>
It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level and frequency of dosage for any particular patient may be varied and will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the metabolic stability and length of action of that compound, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, mode and time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity of the particular condition, and the host undergoing therapy.<br>
In order that the nature of the present invention may be more clearly understood preferred forms thereof will now be described by reference to the following non-limiting Examples.<br><br>

General Procedure 1: Adaption of Organic Preparations and Procedures International, 22(4), 1990, 532-534<br>
The amino compound can be reacted as in scheme 1 with the fumarate derivative or suitable analogues of fumarate where for example the acetyl groups can be replaced by other suitable leaving groups such as tosyl or mesyl. The reaction can be carried out in a suitable solvent such as methanol, DME, DMA, DMSO, chloroform, THF or dioxane. The reaction can be heated or subject to microwave irradiation (see for example B. R. Roberts &amp; C. R. Strauss, Ace. Chem. Res. 2005, 38, 653-661, "Toward Rapid, 'Green' Predictable Microwave-assisted Synthesis"). The reaction can be performed in the absence or presence of catalytic amounts of acid or base.<br><br><br><br><br>
Compounds where the substituent is halogen can be further reacted by methods known to those skilled in the art as shown above, where 'Pd coupling' includes reactions such<br><br>
as Suzuki, Buchwald, Heck or Sonogashira and nucleophilic aromatic substitution (see, for example, reactions described in L. S. Hegedus, "Transition Metals in the Synthesis of Complex Organic Molecules", University Science books, 1994, first edition or M. Smith "Organic synthesis", 2001, McGraw-Hill Science, 2nd edition) which optionally use a metal catalyst such as a suitable form of palladium and reagent 1 is a derivative of Ri (for example derivatives of Ri including halogen or boronate).<br>
Scheme 5.<br><br>
The OH can be protected by methods known to those skilled in the art as shown in scheme (5), for example where 'P' can be benzyl (see I.Stansfield et al, 'Active site inhibitors of HCVNS5B polymerase' Bio-Org. Med-Chem. Lett, 2004, 14, 5085-5088) or a suitable protecting group as described in "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis" Theodora Greene and Peter Wuts, third edition, Wiley Interscience, 1999).<br>
Scheme 6.<br><br>
Example 1: Preparation of Dimethyl Diacetoxyfumarate<br><br><br>
The procedure described in OPPI, 22(4), 1990, 532-534 was followed.<br>
A stirred slightly turbid solution of dihydroxyfumaric acid (10.7 g, 72.5 mmol) in anhydrous methanol (50 mL) under nitrogen was cooled (ice/water bath). Thionyl chloride (10.5 mL, 144 mmol) was added over 20 min under the surface of the methanol ic solution via syringe. After addition, the cooling bath was removed and the mixture stirred at room temperature for 3 d. The resulting precipitate was collected by filtration and washed with cold methanol (10 mL) the water (80 mL). Dimethyl dihydroxyfumarate was obtained as a white solid (11.8 g). This material (10.8 g) and isopropenyl acetate (36 mL) were combined and heated to reflux with stirring under nitrogen for 8 h. The reaction was cooled to room temperature and stored at 0° C overnight. The resulting precipitate was collected by filtration and washed with cold methanol (5 mL) to afford dimethyl diacetoxyfumarate as a white solid (6.4 g).<br>

2-Amino-5-bromo-pyridine (664 mg, 3.85 mmol), dimethyl diacetoxyfumarate (1.00 g, 3.84 mmol) and glacial acetic acid (10 drops) in dry methanol (10 mL) were combined and heated to reflux. After 48 h the reaction was cooled to room temperature and concentrated in vacuo. Ethyl acetate (2 mL) was added to the residue which was sonicated for 2 min and the resulting precipitate collected by filtration and washed with cold ethyl acetate (1 mL) and dried on the pump to afford 7-bromo-3-hydroxy-4-oxo-4//-pyrido[l,2-a]pyrimidine-2-carboxylic acid methyl ester as a yellow solid (24 mg, 2%): *H NMR (300 MHz, CDC13) 5 4.19 (3H, s, OCH3), 7.53 (2H, d, .7=1.4 Hz, H8 and H9), 9.00 (1H, d, .7=1.4 Hz, H6), 10.53 (1H, br s, OH).<br>

5-Morpholin-4-yl-pyridin-2-ylamine was prepared by adapting he procedure described in J. Med. Chem., 2005, 48(7), 2388-2406. Briefly, 5-bromo-2-nitro-pyridine was reacted with morpholine and potassium carbonate in DMSO at 60-70° C to afford 4-(6-nitro-pyridin-3-yl)-morpholine in 84% yield. Reduction with palladium on carbon under a hydrogen atmosphere provided 5-morpholin-4-yl-pyridin-2-ylamine in 70% yield. This was converted into 3-hydroxy-7-morpholin-4-yl-4-oxo-4H-pyrido[l,2-a]pyrimidine-2-carboxylic acid methyl ester in 25% yield by adapting the procedure described in Example 2, where glacial acetic acid was used instead of p-toluenesulphonic acid.<br>

Example 28    Biological Assays<br>
Compounds of the present invention could be tested for biological activity using the assay techniques below:<br>
Example 28.1 3'processing/strand transfer combined assay :<br>
A combined 3'-processing/strand transfer assay procedure similar to that published (Ovenden et al. Phytochemistry. 2004 Dec;65(24):3255-9.) could be used. The assay could be adapted to a 96 well plate format. Briefly, 400ng of the compound to be tested is incubated with 30nM substrate DNA, consisting of annealed U5 LTR sequence oligonucleotides tagged with Digoxigenin (DIG; 5'-<br>
ACTGCTAGAGATTTTCCACACTGACTAAAAGGGTC-DIG-3') or biotin (5'-Bio-GACCCTTTTAGTCAGTGTGGAAAATCTCTAGCAGT-3') so that each substrate has either a DIG or Bio tag on opposite strands. Reactions are carried out for 2hrs at 37°C, products generated as a result of 3'processing and strand transfer activity are bound to streptavidin plates and detected with using anti-DIG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate and p-nitro phenyl phosphate substrate.<br>
Example 28.2 Strand transfer specific assay:<br>
The strand transfer specific assay is of similar format to that of the 3'processing/strand transfer combined assay except that it uses a biotinylated substrate that represents a pre-processed LTR end (5'-Bio-GACCCTTTTAGTCAGTGTGGAAAATCTCTAGCA-<br>
3').<br>
Oligonucleotides 5'-biotin-GACCCTTTTAGTCAGTGTGGAAAATCTCTAGCA-3' and 5'-ACTGCTAGAGATTTTCCACACTGACTAAAAGGGTC-Dig-3' are annealed in 10mM Tris-Cl pH8.0, 100mM NaCl, 2mM EDTA at a final concentration of 30uM.<br>
Each reaction (40ul) contains 30nM substrate DNA ad 400ng integrase in a reaction buffer comprising 20mM Tris-Cl pH7.5, 25mM NaCl, 5mM MnCl2, 5mM MgCl2, 5mM B-ME, 50 ug/mL BSA, 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20.<br><br>
Compounds are added in DMSO at 1/10 final reaction volume.<br>
Reactions are incubated at 37°C for 2hr followed by the addition of 60ul adjustment buffer containing 33mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 664mM NaCl, 16.6mM EDTA, 0.166mg/mL sonicated salmon sperm DNA.<br>
The samples are then transferred to Streptavidin coated plates and products of the enzyme reactions are allowed to bind for lhr at room temperature.<br>
Plates are then washed with 3 x 5min with 30mM NaOH, 200mM NaCl, ImM EDTA then 3 x 5min with wash 2: 10mM Tris-Cl pH8.0, 6mM EDTA, O.lmg/mL nuclease free BSA.<br>
Anti-digoxigenin-phosphatase Fab (Roche, 0.1U/mL)), diluted 1/2000 in wash 2 buffer is then added to each well and plates incubated lhr at 37°C.<br>
Plates are then washed 3 times with TBS- Tween-20 (0.1%) then twice with TBS and 100ul substrate (lmg/mL p-nitrophenylphosphate in 0.1 M Tris, pH 9.8) is added and plates incubated until sufficient colour is developed.<br>
Example 28.3 Inhibition of HIV replication<br>
Cells are seeded into 96 well microtitre plates at 50,000 cells per 50ul per well in RF-10 containing 2|ag/mL polybrene (RF-10/2). Compounds are prepared to 4 x final concentration in RF-10/2, and 30 uL added to cells. Virus (40 uL in RF-10/2 containing 1600 pfu) is added to each well or 40 uL RF-10/2 for negative controls and for assaying compound cytotoxicity. After 24 hrs, an additional 90 uL of media or media containing 1 x compound is added to each well. At 4 days post infection, 100 uL of media is removed from each well and replaced with 100 ul of fresh media with or without compound. Forty eight hours later supernatants are harvested and levels of extracellular p24 determined. Supernatants are diluted 1 in 10,000 and p24 levels assayed using the Vironostika p24 assay kit. EC50 is calculated as the concentration required to inhibit HIV p24 production to 50% that of no drug controls.<br><br><br><br>
Example 28.4 Comparison of activity against wild type and mutant (Q148K) HIV integrase<br>
Example 28.4.1	Strand transfer assay :<br>
A strand transfer assay procedure similar to that published (Ovenden et al. Phytochemistry. 2004 Dec;65(24):3255-9.) is used. Briefly, 400ng of the enzyme, wild type or drug resistant mutant, is mixed with the compound to be tested and incubated with 30nM substrate DNA. The substrate DNA is designed to mimic HIV DNA termini that has undergone 3'end processing, and consists of the annealed U5 LTR sequence oligonucleotides tagged with Digoxigenin (DIG; 5'-<br>
ACTGCTAGAGATTTTCCACACTGACTAAAAGGGTC-DIG-3') or biotin (5'-Bio-GACCCTTTTAGTCAGTGTGGAAAATCTCTAGCA-3') so that each substrate has either a DIG or Bio tag on opposite strands. Reactions are carried out for lhr at 37°C. Products generated as a result of strand transfer activity are bound to streptavidin plates and detected using anti-DIG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate and p-nitro phenyl phosphate substrate.<br>
Figure 1 represents as an example, strand transfer assay results from selected compounds against wild-type integrase and the integrase containing the Q148K mutation.<br>
Example 28.4.2	Mutant enzymes:<br>
HIV integrase was mutated within a shuttle vector (pGEM) containing the majority of the HIV-1 gag mdpol sequence using site directed mutagenesis to generate integrase sequences that have been published as conferring resistance to published integrase inhibitors. These include, but are not limited to, mutations such as Q148K. The integrase coding region was then subject to PCR and cloned into a bacterial expression vector. The specific introduction of desired mutation(s) was confirmed by sequence analysis. Proteins were expressed, purified and used in strand transfer assays.<br>
