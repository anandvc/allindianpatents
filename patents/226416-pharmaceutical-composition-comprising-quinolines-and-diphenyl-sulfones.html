[0001] This application claims the benefit of Application Serial No. 60/443,219, filed<br>
January 27, 2003, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
REFERENCE TO GOVERNMENT GRANTS<br>
[0002] Portions of the disclosure herein may have been supported in part by grants from the<br>
National Institutes of Health. Grant No. NS25637, AG12548, and NS340O0. The United<br>
StateS Government may have certain rights in this application.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] The present invention generally relates to combination therapies of substituted<br>
quinolines and substituted diphenyl sulfones. More specifically, the present invention relates<br>
to compositions containing substituted quinoiines and substituted diphenyl sulfones and<br>
methods of using the compositions in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders,<br>
including, inter alia, Alzheimer's dementia, HIV-1 associated dementia, or Creutzfeld-Jakob<br>
disease.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0004] Alzheimer's disease is a slowly progressive, neurodegenerative disorder that<br>
involves abnormalities in β-amyloid (Aβ) metabolism, the formation of β-amyloid plaques,<br>
chronic neuroinflammation, and loss of synapses and neurons in the neocoitex and<br>
hippoi ampus. It is generally believed that the loss of synapses and neurons account for the<br>
severe defects in cognition associated with Alzheimer's disease.<br>
[0005]	Neuroinflammation and neuron loss is believed to be involved in several<br>
neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's dementia, HIV-1 associated dementia,<br>
spongiform encephalopathy, Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, stroke, trauma, multiple sclerosis.<br><br>
Parkinson's disease, HIV infection of the central nervous system, hereditary hemorrhage with<br>
amyloidosis-Dutch type, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, or Down's syndrome, and the like.<br>
[0006] Although much effort has been expended to develop therapeutics for Alzheimer's<br>
disease and other neurodegenerative diseases associated with neuroinflammation and neuron<br>
loss, little progress has been made in identifying agents that provide neuroprotection.<br>
[0007] Therefore, it would be desirable to identify neuroprotective agents useful for the<br>
prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, especially those associated with<br>
neuroinflammation, neuron loss, and cognitive loss. The compositions and methods of the<br>
present invention are directed toward these, as well as other, important ends.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

[0042] Hydroxychloroquine, a substituted quinoline, and dapsone. a substituted diphenyl<br>
sulfones have been used individually at high levels to prevent and/or treat neurological<br>
disorders, including Alzheimer's dementia. However, it has been unexpectedly discovered<br>
that, when combined, a substituted quinoline and a substituted diphenyl work synergistically<br>
to prevent and treat loss of neurons and hence are useful in the prevention and treatment of<br>
neurological disorders, including, inter alia, Alzheimer's dementia, HIV-1 associated<br>
dementia, and Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, at lower levels.<br>
[0043] The substituted quinoline and the substituted diphenyl sulfones of the present<br>
invention may be prepared in a number of ways well known to those skilled in the art. The<br>
compounds can be synthesized, for example, by the methods described in the references<br>
listed below or variations thereon as appreciated by the skilled artisan. All processes<br>
disclosed in association with the present invention are contemplated to be practiced on any<br>
scale, including milligram, gram, multigram, kilogram, multikilogram or commercial<br>
industrial scale.<br><br>

This compound is also known as dapsone.<br>
[0053] In certain preferred embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition comprises a<br>
compound of of the following formulae, each of which is known prodrug of dapsone,<br>
des:ubed abo\e:<br><br><br>
[0054] It is believed the chemical formulas and names used herein correctly and accurately<br>
reflect the underlying chemical compounds. However, the nature and value of the present<br>
invention does not depend upon the theoretical correctness of these formulae, in whole or in<br>
part. Thus it is understood that the formulas used herein, as well as the chemical names<br>
attributed to the correspondingly indicated compounds, are not intended to limit the invention<br>
in any way, including restricting it to any specific tautomeric form or to any specific optical<br>
or geometric isomer.<br>
[0055] When any variable occurs more than one time in any constituent or in any formula,<br>
its definition in each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other occurrence.<br>
Combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations<br>
result in stable compounds. It is further understood that, while certain substituents are<br>
minimally required the moiety may be further substituted with the same substituent(s),<br>
another substituent(s) from the group of required substituents, or other substituent(s) not from<br>
the group of required substituents.<br>
[0056] All forms of the compounds useful in the pharmaceutical compositions of the<br>
invention, including free acid, free base, and zwitterions, isomorphic crystalline forms, all<br>
chiral and racemic forms, hydrates, sotvates, and acid salt hydrates, are contemplated to be<br>
within the scope of the present invention.<br>
[0057] Compounds of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may contain one or<br>
more asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms, and may be isolated in optically active or<br>
racemic forms. Thus, all chiral, diastereomeric, racemic forms and all geometric isomeric<br>
forms of a structure are intended, unless the specific stereochemistry or isomeric form is<br>
specifically in heated. It is well known in the art how to prepare and isolate such optically<br>
active forms. For example, mixtures of stereoisomers may be separated by standard<br>
techniques including, but not limited to, resolution of racemic forms, normal, reverse-phase,<br>
and chiral chromatography, preferential salt formation, recrystallization, and the like, or by<br>
chiral synthesis either from chiral starting materials or by deliberate synthesis of target chiral<br>
centers.<br><br>
[0058] The compounds of the present invention may be made in the form of the<br>
rnonohydrohalic acid addition salts and/or the solvated compound, for example the<br>
hydrochloride hydrate or the hydrobromide. Other salts may be made however by simple<br>
reaction of a base with acid and may be desirable in order to modify the properties of the<br>
product, such as its toxicity, taste, physical form, or rate of release into the body. For<br>
example, the compounds may be made in the form of the sulfate, bisulfate, phosphate, nitrate,<br>
acetate, maleate, phthalate, succinate, phosphate, nitrobenzoate. stearate, mandelate, N-<br>
acetyl-glycinate, pamoate, sulfonate, di-sulfonate, cyclohexyl sulfamate, citrate, tartrate,<br>
propionate, alveolate, lactate, malate, ascorbate, hydroxymaleate, phenylacetate, glutamate,<br>
benzoate, salicylate, sulfanilate, 2-acetoxybenzoate, fumarate, toluenesulfonate,<br>
methanesulfonate, ethane disulfonate, isethionate, mesylate or gluconate, and the like.<br>
[0059] The compounds (either the substituted quinolines or the substituted diphenyl<br>
sulfones) of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may exist in prodrug form.<br>
Prodrugs inclade, for example, compounds described herein in which a hydroxy, amino, or<br>
carboxy group is bonded to any group that, when the prodrug is administered to a mammalian<br>
subject, cleaves to form a free hydroxyl, free amino, or carboxylic acid, respectively.<br>
Examples include, but are not limited to, acetate, formate and benzoate derivatives of alcohol<br>
and amine functional groups; and alkyl, carbocyclic, aryl, and alkylaryl esters such as methyl,<br>
ethyl, propyl, iso-propyl, butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, cyclopropyl, phenyl, benzyl,<br>
and phenethyl esters, and the like.<br>
[0060] In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention further<br>
comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. Such compositions are prepared in<br>
accordance with acceptable pharmaceutical procedures, such as described in Remington's<br>
Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17th edition, ed. Alfonoso R. Gcnnaro, Mack Publishing Company,<br>
Easton, PA (1985). Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and/or diluents are those that are<br>
compatible with the other ingredients in the formulation and biologically acceptable.<br>
[0061] The compounds of this invention may be administered orally or parenterally, neat or<br>
in combination with conventional pharmaceutical carriers. Applicable solid carriers can<br>
include one or more substances that may also act as flavoring agents, lubricants, solubilizers,<br>
suspending agents, fillers, glidants, compression aids, binders or tablet-disintegrating agents<br><br>
or an encapsulating material. In powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid that is in<br>
admixture with the finely divided active ingredient. In tablets, the active ingredient is mixed<br>
with a carrier having the necessary compression properties in suitable proportions and<br>
compacted in the shape and size desired. The powders and tablets preferably contain up to<br>
99% of the active ingredient. Suitable solid carriers include, for example, calcium phosphate,<br>
magnesium stearate, talc, sugars, lactose, dextrin, starch, gelatin, cellulose, methyl cellulose,<br>
sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidine, low melting waxes and ion exchange<br>
resins.<br>
[0062] Oral formulations are preferred. Formulations for oral or injected use are based on<br>
sufficient solubility as to allow the therapeutic agent to enter solution in the stomach or in an<br>
injectable medium. Suitable drug formulations include, but are not limited to, tablets, pills,<br>
capsules, sachets, granules, powders, chewing gums, suspensions, emulsions, suppositories,<br>
and solutions. Particularly preferred for oral use are tablets and capsules of all varieties and<br>
microbe-free solutions for injection or infusion. Where appropriate and necessary the<br>
formulations may include diluents, binding agents, dispersing agents, surface-active agents,<br>
lubricating agents, coating materials, flavoring agents, coloring agents, controlled release<br>
formulations, sweeteners or any other pharmaceutically acceptable additives, for example,<br>
gelatin, sodium starch glycolate, lactose, starch, talc, magnesium stearate, macrocrystalline<br>
cellulose, Povidone, hydrogenated or unsaturated oils, polyglycols, syrups or other aqueous<br>
solutions. Where the formulations are tablets or capsules and the like the formulations may<br>
be presented as premeasured unit doses or in multidose containers from which the appropriate<br>
unit dose may be withdrawn.<br>
[0063] Liquid carriers may be used in preparing solutions, suspensions, emulsions, syrups,<br>
and elixirs. The active ingredient of this invention can be dissolved or suspended in a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable liquid carrier such as water, an organic solvent, a mixture of<br>
both or pharmaceutically acceptable oils or fat. The liquid carrier can contain other suitable<br>
pharmaceutical additives such as solubilizers, emulsifiers, buffers, preservatives, sweeteners,<br>
flavoring agents, suspending agents, thickening agents, colors, viscosity regulators,<br>
stabilizers, or osmo-regulators. Suitable examples of liquid carriers for oral and parenteral<br>
administration include water (particularly containing additives as above, e.g. cellulose<br>
derivatives, preferably sodium carboxymethyl cellulose solution), alcohols (including<br><br>
monohydric alcohols and polyhydric alcohols e.g. glycols) and their derivatives, and oils {e.g.<br>
fractionated coconut oil and arachis oil). For parenteral administration the carrier can also be<br>
an oily ester such as ethyl oleate and isopropyl myristate. Sterile liquid carriers are used in<br>
sterile liquid form compositions for parenteral administration.<br>
[0064] Liquid pharmaceutical compositions, which are sterile solutions or suspensions, can<br>
be administered by, for example, intramuscular, intraperitoneal or subcutaneous injection.<br>
Sterile solutions can also be administered intravenously. Oral administration may be either<br>
liquid or solid composition form.<br>
[0065] The injectable form may be an aqueous or nonaqueous solution, suspension or<br>
emulsion in a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid, e.g. sterile pyrogen-free water or<br>
parenterally acceptable oils or mixture of liquids which may contain bacteriostatic agents,<br>
antioxidants or other preservatives and stabilizers, buffers (preferably but not limited to a<br>
physiological pH range of 6.5-7.7, solutes to render the solution isotonic with the blood,<br>
thickening agents, suspending agents or other pharmaceutically acceptable additives. Such<br>
forms will be presented in unit dose form such as ampules or disposable injection devices or<br>
in multi-dose forms such as a bottle from which the appropriate dose may be withdrawn, or<br>
as a solid four or concentrate that can be used to quickly prepare an injectable formulation.<br>
All formulations for injection are preferable as sterile and pyrogen free. Suppositories<br>
containing the compound will also contain suitable carriers, e.g. cocoa butter, polyglycols or<br>
other state-of-the-art carriers.<br>
[0066] Preferably the pharmaceutical composition is in single unit dosage form, e.g. as<br>
tablets, capsules, powders, solutions, suspensions, emulsions, granules, or suppositories. In<br>
such form, the composition is sub-divided in unit dose containing appropriate quantities of<br>
the active ingredient; the unit dosage forms can be packaged compositions, for example<br>
packeted powders, vials, ampoules, prefilled syringes or sachets containing liquids. The unit<br>
dosage form can be, for example, a capsule or tablet itself, or it can be the appropriate<br>
number of any such compositions in package form.<br>
[0067] When the combination products are not formulated together in a single dosage form,<br>
the substituted quinoline and the substituted diphenyl sulfone may be administered at the<br><br>
same time or simultaneously (that is, together), or in any order. When not administered at the<br>
same time or simultaneously, that is, when administered sequentially, preferably the<br>
administration of a substituted quinoline and the substituted diphenyl sulfone occurs less than<br>
about one hour apart, more preferably less than about 30 minutes apart, even more preferably<br>
less than about 15 minutes apart, and still more preferably less than about 5 minutes apart.<br>
[0068] In addition to standard pharmaceutical additives there may be included within<br>
formulatiom of the compound other therapeutic agents.<br>
[0069] The dosage of the composition of the present invention that will be most suitable for<br>
prophylaxis or treatment will vary with the form of administration, the particular compounds<br>
closen and the physiological characteristics of the particular patient under treatment.<br>
Generally, small dosages may be used initially and, if necessary, increased by small<br>
recrements until the desired effect under the circumstances is reached. Generally speaking.<br>
oral adminstration may require higher dosages.<br>
[0070] Preferably, administration of the combination products of the invention is oral,<br>
although other routes of administration, as described above, are contemplated to be within the<br>
scope of the present invention. Although it is preferable that the substituted quinoline and the<br>
substituted diphenyl sulfone are all administered in the same fashion (that is, for example,<br>
both orally), if desired, they may each be administered in different fashions (that is, for<br>
example, one component of the combination product may be administered orally, and another<br>
component may be administered intravenously). The dosage of the combination products of<br>
the invention may vary depending upon various factors such as the pharmacodynamic<br>
characteristics of the particular agent and its mode and route of administration, the age, health<br>
and weight of the recipient, the nature and extent of the symptoms, the kind of concurrent<br>
treatment, the frequency of treatment, and the effect desired.<br>
[0071] Although the proper dosage of the pharmaceutical composition of this invention will<br>
be readily ascertainablc by one skilled in the art, once armed with the present disclosure, by<br>
way of general guidance, typically a daily dosage may range from about 0.01 to about 100<br>
milligrams of the substituted quinoline (and all combinations and subcombinations of ranges<br>
therein) and about 0.001 to about 100 milligrams of the substituted diphenyl sulfone (and all<br><br>
combinations and subcombinations of ranges therein) per kilogram of patient body weight.<br>
Preferably, the a daily dosage may be about 0.1 to about 10 milligrams of the substituted<br>
quinoline and about 0.1 to about 10 milligrams of the substituted diphenyl sulfone per<br>
kilogram of patient body weight. Even more preferably, the daily dosage may be about 1.0 to<br>
about 10.0 milligrams of the substituted quinoline and about 1 to about 4.0 milligrams of the<br>
substituted diphenyl sulfone per kilogram of patient body weight. With regard to a typical<br>
dosage form of this type of combination product, such as a tablet, the substituted quinoline<br>
generally may be present in an amount of about 100 to about 300 milligrams and the<br>
substituted diphenyl sulfone in an amount of about 25 to about 100 milligrams. The preferred<br>
dosage form of the combination product contains, preferably in tablet form. 50 mg of dapsone<br>
and 200 mg of hydroxychloroquine, wherein the combination product is administered to the<br>
patient two tunes a day (bid). Alternatively, the combination product may be administered<br>
once a day (os) or three times a day (tid).<br>
[0072] Particularly when provided as a single dosage form, the potential exists for a<br>
chemical interaction between the combined active ingredients, i.e., the substituted quinoline<br>
and the substituted diphenyl sulfone. For this reason, the preferred dosage forms of the<br>
combination products of this invention are formulated such that although the active<br>
ingredients are combined in a single dosage form, the physical contact between the active<br>
ingredients is minimized (that is, reduced).<br>
[0073] In order to minimize contact, one embodiment of this invention where the product is<br>
orally administered provides for a combination product wherein one active ingredient is<br>
enteric coated. By enteric coating one or more of the active ingredients, it is possible not<br>
only to minimize the contact between the combined active ingredients, but also, it is possible<br>
to control the release of one of these components in the gastrointestinal tract such that one of<br>
these components is not. released in the stomach but rather is released in the intestines.<br>
Another embodiment of this invention where oral administration is desired provides for a<br>
combination product wherein one of the active ingredients is coated with a sustained-release<br>
material that effects a sustained-release throughout the gastrointestinal tract and also serves to<br>
minimize physical contact between the combined active ingredients. Furthermore, the<br>
sustained-released component can be additionally enteric coated such that the release of this<br>
component occurs only in the intestine. Still another approach would involve the formulation<br><br>
of a combination product in which the one component is coated with a sustained and/or<br>
enteric release polymer, and the other component is also coated with a polymer such as a<br>
low-viscosity grade of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) or other appropriate materials<br>
as known in the art, in order to further separate the active components. The polymer coating<br>
serves to form an additional barrier to interaction with the other component.<br>
[0074] Dosage forms of the combination products of the present invention wherein one<br>
active ingredient is enteric coated can be in the form of tablets such that the enteric coated<br>
component and the other active ingredient are blended together and then compressed into a<br>
tablet or such that the enteric coated component is compressed into one tablet layer and the<br>
other active ingredient is compressed into an additional layer. Optionally, in order to further<br>
separate the two layers, one or more placebo layers may be present such that the placebo<br>
layers between the layers of active ingredients. In addition, dosage forms of the present<br>
invention can be in the form of capsules wherein one active ingredient is compressed into a<br>
tablet or in the form of a plurality of microtablets, particles, granules or non-pareils, which<br>
are then enteric coated. These enteric-coated microtablets, particles, granules or non-pareils<br>
are then placed into a capsule or compressed into a capsule along with a granulation of the<br>
other active ingredient.<br>
[0075] These as well as other ways of minimizing contact between the components of<br>
combination products of the present invention, whether administered in a single dosage form<br>
or administered in separate forms but at the same time by the same manner, will be readily<br>
apparent to those skilled in the art, once armed with the present disclosure.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
[00801 The compositions of the invention and comparative compounds and compositions<br>
were evaluated in accordance with the test methods described in US-A-6.043,283; US-A-<br>
6,071,493; US-B-6,451,544; US-B-6,451,742; and US-B-6,475,745, the disclosures of which<br>
are incorporated herein by reference. In general, the drug assays involved the addition of<br>
known concentrations of a test agent over a range of concentrations. After 72 hours, the<br>
experiment was stopped and the neurons were identified by immuno-staining. The data was<br>
expressed as % neuronal survival at I-(neuronal number is test sample/neuronal number in<br>
untreated control sample)) x 100%. Dose response curves were then used to estimate the<br>
effective for dose (50%) of the neuroprotective agent (defined as the ED50).<br>

[0082] FIGURE 1 is a plot of % neuron loss for several test agents (homozygous control,<br>
methylcellulose, hydroxychloroquine at a level of 6.5 mg/kg, thalidomide at a level of 2<br>
mg/kg, dapsone at a level of 2 mg/kg, and the combination of hydroxychloroquine and<br><br>
dapsone at 10% of their respective individual doses, i.e., 0.65 mg/kg hydroxychloroquine +<br>
0.2 mg/kg dapsone. It is observed in FIGURE 1 that in vitro hydroxychloroquine (a<br>
substituted quinoline) alone at high levels (6.5 mg/kg), dapsone (a substituted diphenyl<br>
sulfone alone at high levels (2 mg/kg), and the combination of hydroxychloroquine (a<br>
substituted quinohne) and dapsone (a substituted diphenyl sulfone) at 10% of their respective<br>
individual doses, i.e., 0.65 mg/kg hydroxychloroquine + 0.2 mg/kg dapsone produced a<br>
suppression of the in vitro killing effect.<br>
[0083] FIGURE 2 is a plot of % neuron loss as a function of drug concentration for several<br>
test assents (10 nM hydroxychloroquine, the combination of 0.1 nM hydroxychloroquine +<br>
dapsone), the combination of 0.3 nM hydroxychloroquine + dapsone), the combination of 1.0<br>
nM hydroxychloroquine + dapsone).<br>
[0084] An isobologram is useful for determine where the effects of two agents are additive,<br>
potentiating (positively synergistic), or antagonistic (negatively synergistic). Points falling<br>
on the curved line representing a simple additive effect of the two agents, points falling in the<br>
area to the left of the curved line representing a potentiating (positively synergistic) effect of<br>
the two agents, and points falling in the area to the right of the curved line representing an<br>
antagonistic (negatively synergistic) effect of the two agents.<br>
[0085] It is observed in the isobologram of FIGURE 3 that, when the hydroxychloroquine<br>
(a substituted quinoline) and dapsone (a substituted diphenyl sulfone) were combined, the<br>
combination was effective at lower levels at all tested concentrations and exhibited a<br>
potentiating (positively synergistic) effect.<br>
[0086] It has also been demonstrated in vivo that combinations of hydroxychloroquine (a<br>
substituted quinoline) and dapsone (a substituted diphenyl sulfone) show potentiation and<br>
achieved a reduction in neurotoxin levels in the spinal fluid of patients afflicted with<br>
Alzheimer's dementia in six-month clinical trials (as shown in FIGURE 4) and of patients<br>
afflicted with HIV in a six-week clinical trial (as shown in FIGURE 5). In addition, these<br>
patients were able to demonstrate an improvement in standard test with respect to cognitive<br>
function.<br><br>
