				<td>Description<br>
The invention relates to an arrangement for cooling an<br>
electrical module arranged in a housing and to a<br>
technical appliance, in particular a base stations of a<br>
mobile radio system or wireless subscriber line system.<br>
In an electrically operated technical appliance, the<br>
lost power of components and modules through which<br>
current flows leads to a heating-up of the appliance.<br>
Since standard electrical components for technical<br>
appliances have only a limited admissible operating<br>
temperature range, of for example up to 70°C, they are<br>
cooled by cooling devices. These cooling devices are,<br>
for example, fans which establish an air flow in the<br>
housing, flowing around or through the electrical<br>
components and modules, and consequently bring about a<br>
discharge of the thermal output produced.<br>
During operation of the technical appliances outside<br>
enclosed spaces or in adverse conditions within<br>
enclosed spaces, adequate protection from environmental<br>
influences, such as for example dirt particles and<br>
liquids, must be additionally provided along with heat<br>
discharge. In this respect, protective regulations in<br>
accordance with the specified IP classes must be<br>
observed in order to ensure long-term functioning of<br>
the technical appliances.<br>
It is known from DE 19755944 to provide in an air inlet<br>
of a housing a membrane filter for a superficial<br>
filtering of dirt particles from inflowing cooling air<br>
and for separating out liquids. In comparison with a<br>
housing known for example from DE 19626778, with<br><br>
an air/air heat exchanger, which ensures complete<br>
separation of an internal cooling circuit from an<br>
external cooling circuit, adequate protection of the<br>
electrical components can be achieved for the<br>
aforementioned areas of use of the technical appliance<br>
with the corresponding protective regulations in a<br>
simple way by use of the membrane filter. At the same<br>
time, a temperature difference, required for the<br>
cooling, between the temperature of the ambient<br>
atmosphere and the temperature inside the housing is<br>
reduced.<br>
A membrane filter of this type is based, for example,<br>
on a membrane filter known for use in articles of<br>
clothing by the designation Goretex, Sympatex, etc.<br>
The membrane of the filter comprises a fine netting or<br>
knitted fabric of fibers, which permits a very small<br>
pore size. An example of a material which may be used<br>
for this is PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) , also known<br>
by the name Teflon. The membrane is generally provided<br>
on a backing material, such as for example polyamide,<br>
in order to achieve a certain stability and resistance<br>
of the membrane filter.<br>
In addition to the criteria with regard to protective<br>
regulations, EMC guidelines (EMC - Electromagnetic<br>
Compatibility) must also be satisfied, ensuring on the<br>
one hand protection of the electrical modules arranged<br>
in the housing of the technical appliance from<br>
electromagnetic influences from the surroundings of the<br>
appliance and on the other hand protection of the<br>
surroundings from electromagnetic radiation emanating<br>
from the electrical modules.<br>
On account of the plastic material used, the membrane<br>
filter is permeable to electromagnetic radiation and<br><br>
consequently does not bring about adequate shielding.<br>
Additional shielding, for example by a wire netting<br>
arranged in front of the membrane filter, is therefore<br>
necessary to satisfy the EMC guidelines. However, it<br>
is disadvantageous to provide this additional wire<br>
netting as a further element of the housing of the<br>
technical appliance and, for example, it increases the<br>
overall dimensions of the housing. Furthermore, it<br>
makes maintenance and cleaning of the membrane filter<br>
more difficult.<br>
US 5,431,974 discloses a filter arrangement for<br>
electromagnetic shielding. The filter arrangement in<br>
this case comprises an electrically conductive frame<br>
with at least one opening, a panel of porous<br>
electrically conductive material, a layer of<br>
electrically conductive adhesive and also an<br>
electrically conductive gasket material. Preferably<br>
chosen as the porous panel is from synthetic polymers<br>
which has been made electrically conductive at the<br>
surface by electrochemical processes.<br>
The invention is based on the object of specifying an<br>
arrangement for cooling and a technical appliance<br>
which, with known use of a membrane filter, permits<br>
adequate electromagnetic shielding without the<br>
specified disadvantages of the prior art. This object<br>
is achieved by the arrangement for cooling according to<br>
patent claims 1 and 2 and also the technical appliance<br>
according to patent claim 11. Advantageous<br>
developments of the invention can be taken from the<br>
dependent patent subclaims.<br>
The arrangement according to the invention for cooling<br>
an electrical module arranged in a housing has at least<br>
one membrane filter, arranged in an air inlet of the<br><br>
housing in each case, for a superficial filtering of at<br>
least dirt particles from inflowing cooling air for<br>
cooling the electrical module and also at least one<br>
cooling device for establishing an air flow in the<br>
housing and for discharging the filtered cooling air,<br>
heated up on account of flowing through or around the<br>
module, out of the housing from at least one air<br>
outlet. The membrane filter is characterized by having<br>
a netting of an electrically conductive material for<br>
electromagnetically shielding the electrical module.<br>
The configuration of the arrangement according to the<br>
invention has the advantage that an integration of the<br>
electrically conductive<br><br>
netting achieves the effect of electromagnetic<br>
shielding without an additional shielding arrangement<br>
having to be provided. Furthermore, the advantageous<br>
properties of the membrane filter are not restricted.<br>
For example, simple cleaning of the filter without<br>
prior detachment of a shielding grating is possible.<br>
As a result, the housing of the technical appliance can<br>
be provided in a very compact form.<br>
The arrangement according to the invention can be used<br>
in technical appliances with at least one electrical<br>
module, such as for example base stations of a mobile<br>
radio system or wireless subscriber line system (access<br>
network systems), traffic control devices, power supply<br>
devices or switch cabinets for a control system of<br>
industrial machines. In the same way, the arrangement<br>
according to the invention can be used, for example, in<br>
smaller electrical appliances, such as for example a<br>
portable or stationary home computer, or in electrical<br>
measuring instruments.<br>
According to a first configuration of the invention,<br>
the membrane filter additionally separates out liquids<br>
at the surface, whereby use of the technical appliance<br>
is also possible outside enclosed spaces or under<br>
adverse ambient conditions<br>
According to a second configuration, the membrane<br>
filter is provided in the form of a fine-pored membrane<br>
applied to a backing material. This configuration of<br>
the membrane filter advantageously permits individual<br>
adaptability of the backing material and/or the<br>
membrane to special conditions of use of the technical<br>
appliance. For example, a filter resistant to chemical<br>
substances, such as for example acids, can be used for<br>
technical appliances used in production.<br><br>
According to a third development, based on the second<br>
configuration, the electrically conductive netting is<br>
woven into the backing material of the membrane filter.<br>
As a result, a firm bonding of the netting to the<br>
backing material is advantageously achieved, one of the<br>
effects being, for example, that the stability of the<br>
membrane filter is increased.<br>
As an alternative to the third configuration, the<br>
electrically conductive netting is applied to the<br>
backing material. This configuration advantageously<br>
permits simple production of the membrane filter, the<br>
electrically conductive netting being applied to the<br>
membrane filter, for example, in an additional<br>
production step. A bonding between the netting and the<br>
backing material can be achieved, for example, by an<br>
adhesive bonding technique.<br>
According to a further alternative configuration, the<br>
electrically conductive netting is provided in the form<br>
of backing material for the membrane. By this<br>
configuration, the electromagnetic shielding is<br>
advantageously integrated directly into the membrane<br>
filter, as a result of which there are no further<br>
working steps in the production of the membrane filter.<br>
According to further alternative configurations, the<br>
membrane may be made from a PTFE material known as<br>
Teflon or from an electrically conductive material.<br>
The PTFE material is already widely used, for example<br>
for water-impermeable items of clothing, and, on<br>
account of the properties, can be flexibly adapted to a<br>
wide variety of requirements with regard to the pore<br>
size. If the membrane is produced from an electrically<br>
conductive material that has for example the same or<br>
comparable properties, it is advantageously possible to<br>
dispense with the additional electrically conductive<br>
netting.<br><br>
According to a further configuration, the electrically<br>
conductive material may be provided in the form of a<br>
metal, plastic or ceramic material. Plastic and<br>
ceramic materials in particular have advantageous<br>
properties in comparison with known metal materials,<br>
for example with regard to the resistance to<br>
environmental influences, strength and processability.<br>
According to a further configuration of the invention,<br>
the electrically conductive netting is electrically<br>
connected to the housing, the latter likewise being<br>
made at least partially from an electrically conductive<br>
material. Electrically conductive netting may be<br>
understood here according to the invention as meaning<br>
an additional netting, a netting used as a backing<br>
material or a membrane of electrically conductive<br>
material. The connection to the housing brings about a<br>
grounding of the membrane filter, which may<br>
alternatively also be achieved by means of a separate<br>
grounded electrical connection.<br>
According to a further configuration of the invention,<br>
the effective surface area of the membrane filter is<br>
enlarged by a periodic folding, as a result of which<br>
clogging of the filter is advantageously reduced and<br>
the maintenance intervals are increased.<br>
Furthermore, a membrane filter according to the<br>
invention is advantageously additionally arranged at<br>
the air outlet of the housing. This configuration<br>
permits, for example, a reversal of the cooling air<br>
flow in the housing, in order to free the membrane<br>
filter at the air inlet of dirt particles, without dirt<br>
particles or liquids at the same time being able to<br>
pass through the air outlet into the housing.<br><br>
According to a further configuration, the cooling<br>
device comprises a fan impeller driven by a motor. In<br>
this case, the motor speed, and consequently the<br>
throughput of the cooling air in the housing, for<br>
example, can be controlled in dependence on the<br>
temperature in the housing and/or on the temperature of<br>
the ambient atmosphere, with the advantageous result<br>
that a constant operating temperature of the electrical<br>
module and a constant temperature inside the housing<br>
are ensured, and consequently the service life of the<br>
electrical module is advantageously prolonged.<br>
Furthermore, the speed of the cooling device can be<br>
controlled, for example, in such a way that the<br>
admissible limiting temperatures of the electrical<br>
module are not quite exceeded, and consequently the<br>
noise emission of the arrangement is minimized by the<br>
lowest possible speed of the cooling device.<br>
The arrangement according to the invention is suitable<br>
in particular for use in technical appliances, such as<br>
for example base stations or similar outdoor<br>
installations of a mobile radio system, or wireless<br>
subscriber line system, and also in traffic control<br>
devices, radio relay devices etc.<br>
Exemplary embodiments of the invention are explained in<br>
more detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, in<br>
which:<br>
figure 1 shows a base station of a mobile radio system<br>
with the arrangement according to the<br>
invention for cooling electrical modules, in<br>
a front view,<br>
figure 2 shows the arrangement according to the<br>
invention in a side view,<br>
figure 3 shows two ways in which the membrane filter<br><br>
according to the invention can be provided,<br>
by way of example, and<br><br>
figure 4 shows a detailed representation of the<br>
membrane filter according to the invention.<br>
A prior-art technical appliance, such as for example a<br>
base station BTS of a mobile radio system or wireless<br>
subscriber line system, according to figure 1, includes<br>
a plurality of electrical modules BG. During the<br>
operation of the electrical appliance, the lost power<br>
of the individual electrical modules BG results in a<br>
heating-up effect, giving rise to the necessity for<br>
cooling in order not to exceed an admissible operating<br>
temperature of the modules.<br>
The housing G, represented in a front view, of the<br>
electrical appliance has on the end face an air inlet<br>
LE with a membrane filter MB. The overall dimensions<br>
of the air inlet LE are set, for example, in such a way<br>
that cooling air flowing in through the membrane filter<br>
MB from the ambient atmosphere of the technical<br>
appliance can flow through the electrical modules BG in<br>
each case from below, and if appropriate from the<br>
front, and consequently can bring about a cooling-down<br>
of the modules. The active surface area of the<br>
membrane filter MB, which may be larger than the air<br>
inlet LE, for example due to a fold formation, is<br>
dimensioned such that the pressure drop of the<br>
inflowing cooling air can be compensated by a cooling<br>
-device, or an adequate amount of cooling air can still<br>
flow in despite a partial clogging of the membrane<br>
filter MB by dirt particles or liquid.<br>
Figure 2 presents the described technical appliance in<br>
a side view, in order to illustrate in more detail the<br>
internal construction shown by way of example. On the<br>
left-hand side of the housing G, a frame R with the<br>
membrane filter MB is arranged in front of the air<br>
inlet LE. The additional frame R permits rapid removal<br>
of the membrane filter MB, for example for maintenance<br><br>
and cleaning purposes or, for replacement. At the same<br>
time,<br><br>
the frame R permits the described folding of the<br>
membrane filter MB. To restrict the overall dimensions<br>
of the technical appliance, the frame R may also be<br>
integrated into the housing G.<br>
The membrane filter MB is designed in the form of a<br>
surface filter, which has the special advantageous<br>
property of separating out dirt particles and liquids<br>
from the ambient atmosphere already at the surface of<br>
the membrane, whereby, for example, sensitive<br>
electronic components or circuits in the modules BG are<br>
protected from environmental influences of this type.<br>
A membrane filter MB of this type is based, for<br>
example, on a membrane filter known by the designation<br>
Goretex, Sympatex etc. for use in articles of clothing.<br>
The membrane of the filter comprises a fine netting or<br>
a knitted fabric of fibers. A very small pore size<br>
prevents any ingress of dirt particles into the<br>
membrane and consequently clogging. Nevertheless, dirt<br>
particles can be deposited on the surface of the<br>
membrane, but can be removed in a simple way. In the<br>
same way, liquids cannot pass the membrane up to a<br>
specific pressure per unit area.<br>
An example of a material used for the membrane is PTFE,<br>
also known by the name Teflon. The membrane is<br>
generally applied to a coarsely woven backing material,<br>
such as for example polyamide, in order to achieve high<br>
stability and resistance of the membrane filter MB.<br>
A special design of the membrane filter MB allows<br>
protective regulations in accordance with the IP<br>
guidelines up to, for example, IP55 to be satisfied,<br>
thereby permitting use of the technical appliance<br>
outside enclosed spaces or under adverse ambient<br>
conditions, such as occur for example in industrial<br>
production. Special selection of the membrane filter<br>
material additionally allows<br><br>
individual adaptation to the actual ambient conditions,<br>
such as for example resistance to acids.<br>
Known membrane filters MBR produced according to the<br>
prior art consist of materials described above which<br>
are permeable to electromagnetic waves. To satisfy EMC<br>
guidelines (EMC - Electromagnetic Compatibility),<br>
however, the housing G of the technical appliance must<br>
in the same way have an electromagnetic shielding in<br>
the region of the air inlet LE. This is generally<br>
achieved by a wire grating attached in front of the air<br>
inlet LE and electrically connected to the housing.<br>
According to the invention, on the other hand, the<br>
electromagnetic shielding is achieved by a special<br>
configuration of the membrane filter MB, whereby, for<br>
example, the maintenance and cleaning of the membrane<br>
filter MB is simplified. The possible configurations<br>
are presented below in Figures 3a and 3b.<br>
The cooling of the electrical modules BG by a direct<br>
flow of cooling air through the housing G has the<br>
advantage of a necessary temperature difference tending<br>
toward zero between the temperature of the ambient<br>
atmosphere or the temperature of the inflowing cooling<br>
air and the temperature inside the housing G, whereby<br>
the operation of the electrical modules BG is<br>
safeguarded even at a temperature of the ambient<br>
atmosphere of, for example, +7 0°C, which corresponds to<br>
the limiting temperature of the components, reduced by<br>
the degree of internal heating-up.<br>
A cooling device VE, which is arranged for example in<br>
the upper region of the rear housing wall, sucks in the<br>
air heated up as it flows through or around the<br>
electrical modules BG and discharges it to the ambient<br>
atmosphere through an air outlet LA. Used as cooling<br>
devices VE are, for example, one or more fans, which<br><br>
produce an air flow. Cooling by means of natural<br>
convection is not adequate for reliable operation of<br>
the modules BG below the limiting temperature if a<br>
strong heating-up of the modules BG occurs on account<br>
of a high internal lost power.<br>
To control the temperature inside the housing G, the<br>
speed of the fan is automatically controlled. To<br>
acquire parameters for this control, temperature<br>
sensors which permanently determine the temperatures of<br>
the inflowing cooling air and the atmosphere inside the<br>
housing G may be provided, for example in the region of<br>
the air inlet LE and at various points inside the<br>
housing G. In this automatic control, the throughput<br>
of the cooling air in the housing G is changed by means<br>
of the speed of the fan of the cooling device VE in<br>
order to obtain, for example, a constant temperature<br>
inside the housing G independently of the temperature<br>
of the ambient atmosphere. A constant operating<br>
temperature of the modules BG has positive effects, for<br>
example on the service life of the electronic<br>
components and the high-performance circuits. In<br>
addition, constantly keeping the speed of the cooling<br>
device VE low, on condition that the limiting<br>
temperature of the components is not exceeded, makes it<br>
possible to minimize the noise emission of the<br>
technical appliance. Furthermore, the automatic<br>
control makes it possible to dispense with the<br>
operation of the cooling device VE initially during<br>
cold starting of the appliance, to heat up the modules<br>
BG quickly to the desired operating temperature, and to<br>
carry out further automatic control of the cooling<br>
device VE only once this operating temperature has been<br>
reached, to maintain the operating temperature.<br>
During maintenance of the technical appliance, it is<br>
possible, for example by a reversal of the direction of<br>
rotation or a change in the blade setting of the fan<br><br>
impeller of the cooling devices VE, for the<br><br>
air flow in the housing G to be reversed, whereby<br>
cooling air flows into the housing through the air<br>
outlet LA and is led out through the membrane filter<br>
MB. As this happens, dirt particles deposited on the<br>
surface of the membrane filter MB are dislodged, and<br>
consequently a cleaning of the membrane filter MB is<br>
achieved. This cleaning operation may also be<br>
initiated, for example, by a permanent measuring<br>
process of the air throughput in dependence on the<br>
speed of the cooling arrangement VE, when it falls<br>
below a fixed value, the measured ratio indicating the<br>
degree of soiling of the membrane filter MB. In this<br>
case, a membrane filter MB is advantageously likewise<br>
arranged in the air outlet LA, so that no dirt<br>
particles or liquid can get into the housing G even<br>
when the air flow is reversed.<br>
Arranging the modules BG in such a way that they are<br>
spaced apart from one another makes it possible for a<br>
flow to take place through and/or around the modules<br>
BG. According to a known type of design, the modules<br>
BG comprise, for example, a module frame with<br>
electronic components and high-performance circuits<br>
located therein. The module frames are provided with<br>
ventilation slits, through which cooling air can reach<br>
the components and circuits. Within the scope of the<br>
invention, modules BG are understood as also meaning<br>
all the electrical devices of a technical appliance.<br>
These are to include, for example, printed-circuit<br>
boards provided in a personal computer and also<br>
peripheral units, such as for example hard disks.<br>
The arrangement of figure 2 has in the spaces between<br>
the individual modules BG and also below the lowermost<br>
and above the uppermost module BG air-directing<br>
devices, which have the task of distributing cooling<br>
air flowing in through the membrane filter MB evenly<br>
over the base area of the respective module BG, so that<br><br>
a homogeneous<br><br>
flow through the entire module BG occurs. Furthermore,<br>
the air-directing devices may be used for the mutual<br>
electromagnetic shielding of the modules BG with regard<br>
to satisfying the EMC regulations.<br>
Figure 3a and figure 3b each show a membrane filter MB<br>
according to the invention in a sectional<br>
representation. A prior-art membrane filter MB<br>
comprises a coarsely woven and stable backing material<br>
TM with a membrane MBR of a fine knitted fabric or<br>
filament applied thereto. According to the invention,<br>
as shown in figure 3a, a netting GT of an electrically<br>
conductive material is incorporated into the backing<br>
material TM. This conductive material may, for<br>
example, be woven in directly during the production of<br>
the backing material TM, and, in a way corresponding to<br>
figure 1 and figure 4, produce for example a lattice-<br>
shaped structure referred to as Ripstock. The<br>
advantage of weaving-in is to be seen in the fact that<br>
the still very fine-pored surface prevents particles<br>
from becoming lodged on the netting and consequently<br>
clogging the membrane filter MB. A metal, plastic or<br>
ceramic is used as the electrically conductive<br>
material, it also being possible to take into<br>
consideration the use of all materials exhibiting the<br>
desired properties in the future. The electrically<br>
conductive netting GT is connected to frame or<br>
grounded. This may take place by a connection of the<br>
netting GT to the housing, provided that the latter<br>
likewise consists at least partially of an electrically<br>
conductive material.<br>
According to figure 3b, the electrically conductive<br>
netting GT is applied to the carrier material TM and<br>
physically connected to it. Further variants according<br>
to the invention of the construction of the membrane<br>
filter MB, according to which the backing material TM<br>
or the membrane MBR itself consists of an electrically<br><br>
conductive material, are not represented in the<br>
figures. In these<br><br>
latter configurations, it is possible to dispense with<br>
an additional electrically conductive netting, thereby-<br>
further simplifying the construction and production of<br>
the membrane filter MB.<br>
In figure 4, the membrane filter MB, arranged in a<br>
frame R, is shown with an electrically conductive<br>
netting GT. In an enlargement of a detail at the<br>
bottom, the structure of the membrane filter MB is<br>
presented in a plan view. The membrane MBR, comprising<br>
a knitted fabric of individual thin filaments and<br>
permitting a very small pore size, can be seen clearly.<br>
Arranged over the membrane MBR is the netting GT of<br>
electrically conductive material, with a relatively<br>
great distance between the individual members of the<br>
netting GT. The dimensioning of the netting takes<br>
place, for example, in such a way that on the one hand<br>
a smallest possible surface of the membrane filter MB<br>
is sealed by the netting GT, on the other hand adequate<br>
electromagnetic shielding and stability of the membrane<br>
filter MB are achieved. The structure of the<br>
electrically conductive netting GT indicated in figure<br>
1 and figure 4 is shown by way of example and can,<br>
within the scope of the invention, also take the form<br>
of any of a large number of known further structures.<br><br>
