Then the foot plate 7 is bolt-fixed to the attachment brackets 9 and 10. Further, other brackets (with no reference number) are fixed to sides of the frame pipes 8, 8, and an under guard 18 is bolt-fixed to these brackets. In this manner, the foot plate 1 and the under guard 18 are attached to a vehicle body frame F. The under guard 18 covers a lower part of the foot plate 7 .<br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br><br><br>
In the above conventional technique, as the foot plate 7 and the under guard 18 are attached to the vehicle body frame P, it is necessary to provide the upper brackets 9 and 10 and side brackets. Accordingly, the number of brackets is large, and further, as work to fix the brackets to the vehicle body frame F is required, there is plenty of room for improvement.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a technique to enable attachment of step floor and under cover to a frame with a simple structure and a small number of parts.<br>
[Means to Solve the Problems]<br>
To attain the above object, claim 1 is characterized by a scooter type vehicle wherein a head pipe and a pair of left and right main frames extending backward from the head pipe are formed as an integrally-casted frame, and a step floor on which feet are placed and an under cover to be provided below the step floor are attached to the left and right main frames, and wherein a cross member is removably attached between the left and right main frames, further wherein the step floor and the under cover are attached to the cross member. The step floor and the under cover are both attached to removable cross member.  By this arrangement, the number of attachment members to attach the step floor and the under cover to the casted frame can be small.  Accordingly, the step floor and the under cover can be attached to the casted frame with<br><br><br>
a simple structure and a small number of parts. <br>
 The cross member has an attachment member to which a lower part of a leg shield for covering a rider's legs.<br>
The cross member also functions as an attachment member for the lower part the leg shield.  Accordingly, another attachment member to attach the lower part of the leg shield to the casted frame is unnecessary, and work for attachment of such attachment member is u <br>
 finauxiliary machinery<br><br>
box for containing auxiliary machinery such as a battery and a relay is provided below the step floor.<br>
An auxiliary machinery box can be easily provided by effectively utilizing available space under the step floor. <br>

The auxiliary machinery box 18 is provided in rightward-or leftward-shifted position closed to the right or left of the figure from the vehicle body center CL. As the auxiliary machinery box 18 is provided in a rightward- or leftward-shifted position, an interval S2 is formed between the main frame 62 and the auxiliary machinery box 18, and an accelerator wire cable 107 and a rear brake wire cable 108 can be passed through the interval S2.<br><br><br><br><br>
In the step floor 33, edges 33e, 33e are extended downward from left and right ends of the foot plate 33a, and attachment bosses 33f, 33f are projected downward from a lower surface of the foot plate 33a. In the under cover 34, side plates 34b, 34b are extended from left and right ends of a bottom plate 34a to a rear side of the edges 33e, 33e of the step floor 33 .<br><br>
This figure shows that the first cross member 66, removably attached between the left and right main frames 62, 62, functions as an attachment member for the step floor 33 and the under cover 34.<br>
More specifically, left and right ends of the first cross member 66 are overlaid on the flanges 62c, 62c in the left and right main .frames 62, 62, the attachment bosses 33f, 33f of the step floor 33 are overlaid on the left and right ends. and the flanges 62c, 62c the left and right ends of the first<br>
cross member 66, and the attachment bosses 33f, 33f are fastened together with bolts 111,111 and nuts 112,112. The nut 112 is attached toa clip 113, and is positioned by inserting the clip 113 into the flange 62c.  Note that the presence/absence of the clip 113 is arbitrarily determined.<br>
Further, in the first cross member 66, auxiliary stays 68, 68 having an approximately inverted L-shaped rear view are fixed to the left and right ends, and the side plates 34b, 34b of the under cover 34 are attached to vertical plates 68a, 68a of the auxiliary stays 68, 68 with bolts and nuts 114,<br><br>
114 .<br>
Fig. 7 is a cross - sec tional view along a line 7-7 in Fig. 4, showing that the second cross member 67, removably attached between the left and right main frames 62, 62, functions as an attachment member for the step floor 33 and the under cover 34 .<br>
More specifically, in the under cover 34, cover flanges 34c, 34c extending horizontally from upper ends of the side plates 34b, 34b toward the vehicle width center C .  In the left and right frames 62, 62, the left and right ends of the second cross member 67 and attachment bosses 33g, 33g of the step floor 33 and the cover flanges 34c, 34c of the under cover 34 are overlaid on the flanges 62c, 6 2c and bolt- fixed thereto . The details of bolt fixing structure will be described in the next Fig. 8. Fig. 8 is a detailed view of attachment member for the second cross member, according to the present invention.<br>
The cover flange 34c, overlaid on the flange 62c of the main frame 62, has a vertically formed through hole 34d having a comparatively large diameter.<br>
In the second cross member 67, an approximately cup-shaped boss 67a projecting downward is formed at an end. The boss 67a comprises an approximately dish-shaped lower end 67b having a diameter slightly smaller than that of the through hole 34d, a horizontal step 67c connected to an upper end of the lower end 67b, and a cylinder 67d connected to the step<br><br>
67c, having a diameter larger than that of the through hole 34d.<br>
In the step floor 33, the attachment boss 33g is projected downward from the lower surface of the foot plate 33a, and a lower end surface of the attachment boss 33g is placed on a bottom surface of the lower end 67b in the second cross member 67 .<br>
In the structure of attachment of the second cross member, the cover flange 34c is overlaid on the flange 62c of the main frame 62, then the boss 67a of the second cross member 67 is overlaid thereon, to place the step 67c on the cover flange 34c, further, the step floor 33 is overlaid thereon, to place the lower end surface of the attachment boss 33g on the bottom surface of the lower end 67b, and fastened together with a bolt 115 and a nut 116 .  The nut 116 is attached to a clip 117, and is positioned by inserting the clip 117 into the flange 62c. Note that the presence/absence of the clip 117 is arbitrarily determined. <br>
Further, this figure shows that in the foot plate 33a, a boss 33o extending downward is formed in a position facing<br>
the second cross member 67, and the boss 33o is placed on the<br><br>
second cross member 67 and fixed therein with a screw 118 from a lower position.  In this manner, the second cross member 67 also supports the foot plate 33a in the step floor 33. Similarly, by screw-fixing the foot plate 33a to the first cross member 66 as shown in Fig. 6, the first cross member<br><br><br>
66 supports the foot plate 33a. Accordingly, the first and second cross members 66 and 67 can be considered as support members (reinforcements) to support the step floor 33.<br>
In this manner, as shown in Figs. 6 to 8, the first and second cross members 66 and 67 supporting the step floor 33 also function as attachment members for the step floor 33 and the under cover 34. As a result, other attachment members to attach the step floor 33 and the under cover 34 to the vehicle body frame 11 are unnecessary, and work of attachment of such attachment members is unnecessary. Further, as both step floor 33 and under cover 34 are attached to the first and second cross members 66 and 67, the number of attachment members can be small. Accordingly, the step floor 33 and the under cover 34 can be attached to the vehicle body frame 11 with a simple structure and a small number of parts. <br>
Fig. 9 is a cross-sectional view of an under-cover side support structure according to the present invention, showing that a side of the under cover 34 is supported by engagement with the main frame 62.<br>
More specifically, in the under-cover side support structure, a projection 62d is formed at a predetermined pitch in a vehicle front-and-rear directions (front-side and rear-side directions of the figure) , on the flange 62c of the main frame 62, the cover flange 34c of the under cover 34 is overlaid on the flange 62c, and further, an engagement hole 34e formed in the cover flange 34c is engaged with the<br><br>
projection 62d.<br>
In this manner, the under cover 34 can be supported by the main frame 62 only by engaging the projection 62d with the engagement hole 34e.  It is not necessary to fix this portion with a bolt, a screw, a rivet or the like.  Accordingly, the number of parts is small, and attaching work is simple, which reduces costs.<br>
Note that in the attachment structure of the under cover 34, it is arbitrarily determined to employ both (1) the structure for attachment to the main frame 62 by engagement structure as shown in this figure and (2) the structure for bolt-fixing to the main frame 62 via the first and second cross members 66 and 67, as shown in Figs. 6 to 8. <br>
Figs. 10(a) and 10(b) are cross - sectional views of an under-cover rear support structure according to the present invention.<br>
(a)	shows that a thin hinge 34f provided in a rear part of the bottom plate 34a of the under cover 34, a hinge arm piece 34g extending backward from the hinge 34f and a hook 34h projected upward from a rear end of the hinge arm piece 34g are integrally formed.<br>
(b)	shows that the hinge arm piece 34g is elastically deformed upward, and the hook 34h is engaged with the a rear cross member 63 of the front frame 11F.  By this engagement, the rear lower part of the under cover 34 can be supported by the main frame 62, and it is not necessary to fix this portion<br><br><br><br>
with a bolt, a screw, a rivet or the like. Further, in the bottom plate 34a, a cooling-air inlet port 34m is opened by upward elastic deformation of the hinge arm piece 34g. By introducing engine cooling air from the outside through the cooling-air inlet port 34m, the engine 22 (See Fig. 4) can be cooled.<br>
Note that the rear support structure for the under cover '34 and the cooling-air inlet structure are also shown in the above Fig. 4. Fig. 11 is a left-side cross - sectional view of the box check port according to the present invention, showing that an engagement hole 33i is opened in a front edge 33h of the box check port 33c, a front end 105a of the lid 105 is inserted into the engagement hole 33i, and a rear end 105b of the lid 105 is fixed to a rear edge 33j of the box check port 33c with a screw 119.  The lid 105 can be removed by removing the screw 119.<br>
[,0039] Fig. 12 is a left-side cross - sectional view of the plug check port according to the present invention, showing an engagement hole 33m is opened in a front edge 33k of the plug check port 33d, a front end 106a of the lid 106 is inserted into the engagement hole 3 3m, and a hook 106c in a rear end 106b of the lid 106 is fixed by engagement with an edge 33n in a rear upper position of the plug check port 33d.  The lid 106 can be removed by removing the hook 106c.<br><br>
Fig. 13 is a plan view of the auxiliary machinery box according to the present invention, showing that in the auxiliary machinery box 18, the flange 18a is provided in a front upper portion, the bracket 18b is provided in a rear lower portion, and the flanges 18c, 18c are provided in upper left 'and right portions.-<br>
Further, this figure shows that the battery 103, a battery regulator 121, three relays 122 , 123, 124 and two fuses 125 and 126, and a radiator reserve tank 127 are contained, as auxiliary machinery of the scooter type vehicle, in the auxiliary machinery box 18. In this manner, as the auxiliary machinery box 18 contains the various auxiliary machinery 103 and 121 to 127, it is very easy to attach the various auxiliary machinery 103 and 121 to 127 below the step floor 33. Thus operability of attaching work is increased.<br>
In this figure, numeral 18e denotes a battery containing wall; 18f, 18g and 18h, relay attachment members; 18i, 18i, fuse attachment members; 18j, a regulator attachment member; and 18k, a harness attachment member. <br>
Fig. 14 is an exploded perspective view showing the front frame, the first and second cross members, the auxiliary machinery box, the leg shield, the step floor and the under cover according to the present invention, for deeper understanding of the respective structures described in the above Figs . 3 to 13 .  Note that a part of the members is omitted for easy reference to the drawings. <br><br>
The leg shield 32 has the following attachment structures (1) to (3) .<br>
(1)	Left and right positioning pins 32b, 32b are extended downward from the edge 3 2a in the lower rear part of the leg shield 32, and the positioning pins 32b, 32b are engaged with pin holes 66a, 66a of the. first cross member 66, to position the leg shield 32.<br>
(2)	Left and right bosses 32c, 32c are extended backward from the edge 32a in the lower rear part of the leg shield 32, and the bosses 32c, 32c are attached to arms 68b, 68b of the auxiliary stays 68, 68 of the first cross member 66 with screws 131, 131.<br><br>
(3)	Left and right engagement members 32d, 32d are extended forward from a front surface of the leg shield 32, and the engagement members 32d, 32d are engaged with engagement claws 34j, 34j formed in a rear surface of a front wall 34i of the under cover 34.<br>
(4)	An expanding member 34k is expanded backward from the rear surface of the front wall 34i in the under cover 34, and the expanding member 34k is attached to the head pipe post 61 with a screw 132.<br>
As the first cross member 66 has arms 68b, 68b as attachment members to be attached to the lower part of the leg shield 32, other attachment members for attachment of the leg shield are unnecessary, and attachment work of such attachment members is unnecessary. Accordingly, the lower<br><br>
part of the leg shield 32 can be attached to the front frame 11F with a simple structure and a small number of parts. Note that in the embodiment of the present invention, (1) the vehicle body frame 11 is not limited to divisive frame divided in front and rear frames, but may be an integrated frame.  Further, the vehicle body frame 11 may be a weld-structured frame or synthetic resin frame integrally molded with thermoplastic resin reinforced with glass fiber, as well as the casted frame.<br>
(2)	The cross members removably attached between the left and right main frames 62, 62 in the vehicle body frame are not limited to the first and second cross members as shown in Fig. 5, further, not limited to two front and rear members . Further, the position and structure of attachment are arbitrarily determined.<br>
(3)	The positions, shapes and sizes of the box check port<br>
33c and the plug check port 33d may be arbitrarily determined as long as maintenance and checking work on the battery 103<br>
and the spark plug 95 can be easily made.<br><br><br><br><br>
[Effects of the Invention] The present invention with the above structure has the following effects.<br>
In claim 1, as the cross member is removably attached<br>
between the left and right main frames, and the step floor<br><br><br>
and the under cover are attached to the cross member, the number of attachment members to attach the step floor and the under<br><br><br>
cover to the casted frame can be small . Accordingly, the step floor and the under cover can be attached to the casted framed with a simple structure and a small number of parts.<br><br>
In claim 2, as the cross member has an attachment member to which to the lower part of the leg shield covering the rider' s legs is attached, another attachment member to be attached to the leg shield is unnecessary, and work of attachment of such attachment member is unnecessary. Accordingly, the lower part of the leg shield can be attached to the casted frame with a simple structure and a small number of parts. <br><br>
In claim 3, as the auxiliary machinery box for containing auxiliary machinery including a battery and a relay is provided below the step floor, the auxiliary machinery box can be easily provided by effectively utilizing an available space below the step floor. <br>
In claim 4, as the engine is provided in the rear of the step floor, the spark plug is provided in the front part of the engine, and the plug check port to check the spark plug is provided in the rear part of the step floor, the spark plug can be checked from the plug check port regardless of the presence of the step floor. Thus checking work can be easily made .<br><br><br>
