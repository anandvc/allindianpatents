FIE D OF THE INVENTION <br>
This invention relates to radiopaque glass filler and a process for the preparation thereof This invention further relies to radiopaque glass fillers for use in dental composites to induce radiopacity.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Currently, filler materials which induce radiopacity to hiotnaterials including dental materials are not available in India The price of imported radiopaque fillers which are currently in use in radiopaque composites is very high.<br>
OBJECTS Of THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of this invention to propose a radiopaque glass filler which may be prepared from indigenous products and is therefore cheap.<br>
It is a further object of this invention to propose a radiopaque gia&gt;;s tiller possessing a high compressive strength-, diametral tensile strength, ttexurai 
sorption value.<br>
These and other objects and advantages of this invention will be apparent from the<br>
ensuing descriptioa<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OP THE INVENTION<br>
Thus according to this invention is provided a radiopaque glass powder for use in dental composites comprising one or more oxides of metals selected from silicon,, boron, barmm and aluminium.<br>
According to this invention is further provided a method for the preparation of a radiopaque glass filler.<br>
In accordance with this invention, the glass filler comprises 45 to 65 parts by weight of silica, 15 to 35 parts by weight of barium oxide, 5 to 15 parts by weight of boron trioxide<br><br>
and 5 to 15 parts by. weight of alumina The mixture is heated for 1 to 2 hrs. at a temperafur&amp; HI the range of 1400 to I600°C in a muffle furnace* ami quenched in distilled water for a period of 15 to 30 mins,. The glass granules thus obtained are powdered into smaller particles in a zirconia grinding cup upto 
In u further embodiment of this invention* the glass filler is used for the preparation of a dental paste for preparing a dental filling cement for instant application.<br>
In accordance with the further embodiment of this invention* the glass filler is heated with a silaue coupling agent such as trimethoxypropyl silyl methaciylate before being mixed with a thinned oligomer consisting of Bisphenol A-glycidyl methacrylate resin and diluents such as Methylene glycol dimethacrylate to form a high viscosity paste. The paste contains additives such as photoinitiator, inhibitors and activators* in addition to the thinned oligomer. The mixing is earned out at room temperature.<br>
The coupling agent is used in amounts of 0,5 to 15%. The photoinitiator used is a diketone such as camphorquinone which is used in an amount of 0.1 to 1% by weight of the thinned oligomer.<br>
TTie inhibitor which also includes UV stabilisers is selected from butylated hydroxy toluene and is used in 10 to 1000 ppm based on the weight of the oligomer. The UV stabiliser is selected from phenyl salicylate in combination with/without 2-hydroxy 4-ruethoxy benzophenone.<br>
The activator is selected from tertiary amines such as dimethyl p-toluidine or dimethyl amino phenethyl alcohol or diethyl p-toluidine The activator is used in amounts of 0.1 to 1% by weight of the thinned oligomer<br><br>
Ihe paste thus obtained cures into a hard solid when exposed to a visible light of 440-480 am wavelength for J 0-30 sees, and the cured material rs found to be radiopaque when exposed to dental X-ray*;. The radiopaque paate ibrmulufiona using this filler has been studied for its curing characteristics* water sorption, mechanical properties such as compressive strength, diametral tensile strength and transverse strength. All the properties were comparable with control imported materials and much above the minimum requirements stipulated by the International specifications. The radiopaque nature of the cured composite has been determined using dental X-ray» and compared wife control.<br>
Hie invention will now be explained in greater detail wife help of the following non-limiting example,<br><br><br>
70 parts by weight of a dinKthacrylatc such as BisphcnoJ A-Glycidyl diraethacrylate (B1S-GMA) is mixed with 30 parts by weight of a low molecular weight dimethacrylate such as ethylene glycol dunethacrylate(£GDMA) or triethyleneglycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) in order to decrease the viscosity and increase the flow character of the B1S-GMA. A photoinitiator such as (-)Camphorquinone (CQ, 0.25%), a tertiary amine activator such as dimethyl p-toiuidine (DMPT) or dimethylamino pbencthyl alcohol (DMAPE A. 0.5%), 0-04 to 0.1 % of stabilisers and inhibitors such as butylatcd hydroxyl toluene (BHT), $ak&gt;l and UV-9 are also added and mixed with the parent resin mixture.<br>
100 parts of the above resin mixture is further mixed with 400-440 parts by weight of sijgjated radiopaque glass filler having a compositioo.of SiCh 55, BaO 25, B2Oj 10 and AJbOj-10 and 12 parts by weight of pyrogenic silica filler to form a paste of appropriate viscosity. This paste cures into a hard solid when exposed to a light source of 440-480 nm wavelength within 10*30 sees.<br><br><br><br>
