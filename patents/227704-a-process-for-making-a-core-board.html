PROVISIONAL SPECIFICATION<br>
(See section 10 and Rule 13)<br>
CORE BOARD<br>
BILTUBE LIMITED<br>
An Indian Company<br>
of 1099B, Model Colony, Pune-411 016,<br>
Maharashtra, India<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION DESCRIBES THE INVENTION<br><br>
This invention relates to a novel core board/cone board and a process for making the core board.<br>
Particularly this invention relates to a core board/cone board made of paper, particularly kraft paper, and a process for making thereof.<br>
Hereinafter, use of the term core board, includes the use of expression cone board.<br>
Paper manufactured by the conventional process more commonly known as Kraft paper, can be produced up to a maximum of 250 GSM. Anything above 250 GSM is normally known as Kraft board and is normally manufactured by adhering / laminating 2 or more sheets of Kraft paper together to achieve the desired GSM of Kraft Board. Kraft Board has variety of applications including making of packaging containers, cones, spools, tubes among many others. Although the desired thickness and GSM can be achieved by multiple layers of Kraft paper adhered / laminated together, the products made from such Kraft Boards have the following key limitations:<br>
1.	Very low Ply bond strength.<br>
2.	Products made from Kraft Board have very low vertical and horizontal compression strengths.<br>
This invention provides a process for manufacturing of a novel monolithic Core Paper (below 250 GSM) and Core Board (above 250 GSM and up to 1500 GSM), which can be used for all applications where currently the Kraft paper and Kraft board are used with unique advantages of the product having significantly greater strengths due to unique manufacturing process leading to a monolithic Core Paper and Core Board having very high specific plybond strengths from 280 j/m2 to 1500 j/m2. The Core Boards so manufactured, have more preferably, significant value when used in the manufacture of high grade Yarn bobbins, Yarn Tubes, Paper Cones, Paper Cores and Film Cores, where the compression strengths and stability are very critical and are required to be very high. The tubes or cores act as a carrier to various products like synthetic yarns, cotton yarn, paper, film, etc. The tubes or yarn bobbins made out of this unique monolithic Core Board can perform on very high speed winders of as high as 6000 mpm, can sustain very high centrifugal pressure created during synthetic yarn winding, maintain dimensional stability of tubes, protect from transit damages and offer higher recyclability.<br>
2<br><br>
The Paper Cores made out of this Core Board provide exceptional beam strength, lowest shrinkage and minimal bending and ovality across the length.<br>
The Core Board manufactured in accordance with this invention offers three unique advantages.<br>
1.	Higher grammage monolithic board of up to 1500 grams per square meter in single layer<br>
2.	Higher Ply Bond from 280 up to 1500 jules/m2<br>
3.	Higher horizontal and vertical compression strengths (over 200% higher on comparable basis for products made from Kraft Board with equivalent GSM) for spiral and parallel winding applications<br>

The combination of the furnish is decided on the basis of Burst factor, Tensile strength, Ply Bond, COBB, Bulk, GSM, etc. defined either by the customer or recommended by in-house technical team based on the application.<br>
Conveyor:<br>
The furnish is loaded on to the conveyor, which carries the furnish in to the pulper. Various types of conveyors are used depending on the batch size, quality of furnish, space availability and height of the pulper from the bottom.<br>
The basic function of conveyor is only to feed the pulper and as such irrespective of the type of conveyor, it has no bearing on the end quality of the product.<br>
Pulper:<br>
Furnish is poured into the Pulper thru conveyor. The pulping process is a batch type process. You need to make sure that the combination desired is maintained for each pulper batch. Water is added together with certain amount of furnish. The water is added into sufficient quantity to maintain the consistency of the pulp at 2%-30%. Rotor inside the pulper ensures that the various furnish fed inside is pulped   and   mixed   uniformly  to  develop  the   homogenous   pulp  of  desired<br>
5<br><br>
consistency. The rotor keeps functioning till the fibers are separate at desired Degree SR.<br>
The Degree SR (Fiber Freeness) is very important for the process and is maintained between 10 and 40 in the pulper and between 45 and 75 at the Head box for GSM range of 250 plus (Core Board). Below250 GSM, the Degree SR is maintained between 20 and 55 at the pulper and between 40 and 80 at the Head box.<br>
The pulping process to achieve desired Degree SR may take minimum 2 minutes to up to 120 minutes depending upon the quality of the furnish.<br>
The pulping process thru rotor also ensure that other contaminations such as plastic, metal, aluminum, sand, thermocol, etc are completely separated from the paper fiber.<br>

The starches used are in native, cationic or modified form.<br>
'Starch gel' is prepared and mixed with the pulp. It helps improving ply bond, burst factor, sizing, retention and formation. Starch infusion ratio depends upon which ply bond grade paper is being produced.<br>
Starch gel is added into the process in concentrations of 5% to 35% of the total end product weight depending on the required ply bond (internal fiber bonding) range between 300 jules/m2 and 1500 jules/m2 and other dry strength improvement requirements.<br>
The starch gel is prepared by cooking the starch along with Gelling Solution before infusion.<br>
Method of Preparation of Liquid Starch gel<br>
•	Take the required amount of normal water (untreated or treated but preferably of lower hardness) in a steam jacketed SS vessel.<br>
•	Place an agitator or homogenizer. The speed of Agitator / homogenizer to be adjusted according to the amount of starch to be added resulting in a varying viscosity<br>
•	Depending on the specific plybond strength required in the board, add specified amount of starch (720-1440 kg) Slowly in the vessel with the agitator / homogenizer in ON position<br>
16<br><br>
•	Add 5%-30% of gelling solution as a percentage of starch (with continuous stirring).<br>
•	The gelling solution is a mix of 200-800 kgs of Silicates, 5-30 kgs of strengthening agent like Urea, 5-35 kgs of Formalin, 0.5-12 kgs of HCL homogenized with the help of stirrer at 30-65° Celsius.<br>
•	Heat the mixture with the help of steam. Control temperature between 40 -50° for the 1st 30 minutes followed by increasing the temperature between 55 - 65° for the rest of the time period till the mixture gets partially gelatinized.<br>
Specifications of starch<br>
•	PH:	2.0 to 4.0 (10% Solution)<br>
•	Viscosity: 32 to 60 Sec/50 ml<br>
•	Moisture:  Max 16%<br>
•	Ash:	Max 2.0%<br>
•	Acidity:     0.80 to 1.0 ml of 0.1 NaoH solution<br>
The starch gel is dosed into the pulper or in blending chest or thru suction line of Fan Pump or at the head box or sprayed on the paper web passing thru the wire table. In case of mould machine or former machine, it can be dosed at the wet end. In case of single layer or multi layer wire machine, it can be dosed either of the above mentioned points.<br>
On the wire part the excess water is removed from the pulp thru Forming Board, Table rolls, Hydro foils, Low vacuum boxes, Suction boxes and Suction couch. The starch gel, spread uniformly within the pulp, acts as a retention agent and ensures minimum drainage of fiber along the dewatering process.<br>
Towards the end of the wire, steam shower is installed with following specifications.<br>
Steam Shower Specifications<br>
•	Steam pressure: 4kg - 7kg<br>
•	Distance of shower from the wire: 50 mm - 200 mm depending on the GSM and thickness of Core Board and Core Paper<br>
•	Number of shower: up to 20<br>
•	Number of steam holes : 60 - 150<br>
17<br><br>
Due the steam shower towards the end of the wire, the temperature of Pulp on the wire goes up from 40°C - 48°C to 43°C - 60°C. The partially gelatinized starch within the pulp gets fully gelatinized. The molecular weight of the starch increases and the chain becomes longer. The expanded chain binds the fibers within the pulp and creates a stronger web. This strongly linked web enables extensive hydrogen bonding with fiber surfaces and gives extra bonding strength to the finished Core Board.<br>
The mechanism of dry strength improvement by wet-end starch is based on inter-fiber bonding. Here its free glucose hydroxyl groups participate in hydrogen bonding with fiber surface cellulose molecules, which means a chemical hydration of the fiber compound system. Starches provide more uniformly distributed fiber-fiber bonds by hydrogen bonding.<br>
Paper Machine Section<br>
Pressure screen:<br>
Medium consistency vertical centrifugal outward flow type pressure screen is used to disintegrate the lumps present in the pulp. Operating consistency between 0.5 -3.0% with counter sung hole drilled basket.<br>
Operating consistency is maintained up to 0.5% -3.0%.<br>
The basic purpose of pressure screen is to ensure homogenous mixing of chemicals into pulp and prevent impurities from going on to the main machine. And as such any such type of Pressure Screen meeting this functionality can serve for the making of Core Board or Core Paper.<br>
Head box:<br>
To receive the stock supplied by fan pump and evenly distribute across the whole width of the paper m/c. To maintain uniformity of fibrous suspension with the help of holey rolls. Supply of stock on the paper m/c in the form of wider stream of uniform thickness without local flow disturbances to give uniform basis weight, head box can consist of multiple spindles at regular pitch and there is a possibility of adjustment of each spindle for better Cross Direction profile.<br>
18<br><br>
The basic purpose of Head box is to release the pulp at desired consistency and with minimum turbulence for equal pulp spread across the wire part in cross direction and machine direction and as such any such type of Head box meeting this functionality can serve for the making of Core Board or Core Paper.<br>
Wire part:<br>
Its function is to wave and dewater the stock in such a way that paper web formed is sufficient strong to run through the process.<br>
A typical wire part consist of six parts from which dewatering takes place.<br><br>
	Parts	NOS.	Consistency Inlet (%)<br>
1.	Forming Board	01 - 05	0.50 - 1.80<br>
2.	Table rolls	02- 08	2.00 - 3.00<br>
3.	Hydro foils	03-09	3.00 - 4.00<br>
4.	Low vacuum boxes	02- 10	4.00 - 5.00<br>
5.	Suction boxes	03 - 16	7.0- 18.0<br>
6.	Suction couch	01	15.0 - 25.0<br>
The basic purpose of Wire Table is to ensure the gradual removal of water from the pulp and web formation. And as such any such type of Wire meeting this functionality can serve for the making of Core Board or Core Paper.<br>
Though the comments explain the process on the wire part, in specific, the end results can also be achieved on any kind of Paper Machines of past or present technologies including single layer and multi-layer wires, former machines, single mould or multi-mould machines, etc.<br>
Vacuum System:<br>
Paper web after table rolls or stationary drainage elements passes to Hydro foils, low vacuum boxes suction boxes, Suction couch and in press section.<br>
