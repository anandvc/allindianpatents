BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a socket structure. In particular, the<br>
present invention relates to a socket structure that can rapidly provide a<br>
connection wire and an electrical connector so that the user can easily connect<br>
an electronic device.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Electronic devices, (such as cell phones, digital still cameras, PDAs, or<br>
other portable electronic devices) needs to be charged or connected to a power<br>
source so that the electronic devices can resume normal operation from low<br>
power. Therefore, commonly a household electric power is often used as the<br>
power source.<br>
The wire layout of the household electric power is embedded into the<br>
wall, and a socket located on the wall is used for connecting the electrical<br>
power wire or the signal wire (i.e. transmission wire such as a DSL cable).<br>
When the power of an electronic device is exhausted and needs to be connected<br>
with an electric power to be operated or charged, or when the electronic device<br>
needs to be connected with a signal wire to transmit the data, the user can plug<br>
the electronic device via a transmission wire and a plug into the socket so that<br>
the electronic device is connected with the electric power or the signal wire to<br>
obtain the electric power or the network signal.<br>
Furthermore, as the electronic devices are advancing technologically, the<br>
associated electrical connector also advances in respect and a variety of<br>
electrical connectors are thus designed, such as USB connectors for universal<br><br>
usage, proprietary connectors for product protection, and etc. When the<br>
electronic device (i.e. external storage device, which usually already has a<br>
female electrical connector built-in) needs to be connected with an electronic<br>
equipment (i.e. a computer, which, usually already has a female electrical<br>
connector built-in), an electrical connector (i.e. a male connector to<br>
compliment the female connectti'r) ;and a^connection wire (i.e. the cable part<br>
.. following the electrical connector which bridges the electronic device and the<br>
electronic equipment) are used for electrically connecting the electronic device<br>
and the electronic equipment so that the electronic device and the electronic<br>
equipment can transmit the electrical power or the signals via the connection<br>
wire.<br>
However, although the socket structure of the prior art can be located<br>
with an electrical connector, the socket structure still does not have a<br>
connection wire. When the user needs to connect the electronic device with the<br>
socket structure, the user needs to find a proper connection wire along with the<br>
prpper electrical connector to match the socket structure. After the user finished<br>
using the socket structure, the user needs to remove the connection wire along<br>
with the proper electrical connector, and stores the connection wire along with<br>
the proper electrical connector in a proper location, which can be time-<br>
consuming. Moreover, the removed connection wire along with the proper<br>
electrical connector is sometimes lost, which is inconvenient for the user. On<br>
the other hand, if the user does not remove the connection wire along with the<br>
proper electrical connector then the exposed connection wire is messy and can<br>
be unaesthetic to the user.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
One particular aspect of the present invention is to provide a socket<br>
structure that can rapidly provide the connection wire and the electrical<br>
connector so that the user can easily connect an electronic device. When the<br>
user does not use the connection wire and the electrical connector, the<br>
connection wire and the electrical connector can be stored in the socket. Messy<br>
connection wire exposure is thus eliminated and the connection wire and the<br>
electrical connector will not disturb the user.<br>
The socket structure includes a socket body having a panel and at least<br>
one socket unit, a connection wife,and an electrical connector. The socket<br>
body has a receiving slot. One end of the connection wire extends into the<br>
socket body. The electrical connector is connected with the second end of the<br>
connection wire. The connection wire and the electrical connector are<br>
selectively received in the receiving slot or extend to outside of the receiving<br>
slot.<br>
The present invention has the following characteristics. The present<br>
invention combines the connection wire and the electrical connector on the<br>
socket structure, and the connection wire and the electrical connector are<br>
movably located on the socket structure so that the connection wire and the<br>
electrical connector can be pulled outside of the socket body or received in the<br>
sqcket body. When the user needs to use the connection wire and the electrical<br>
connector, the user merely needs to pull out the connection wire and the<br>
electrical connector from the socket body. The user does not need to find the<br>
connection wire and the electrical connector. It is convenient for the user. The<br><br>
user does not need to carry around a connection wire and an electrical<br>
connector, furthermore the user does not need to remove the connection wire<br>
and the electrical connector once me user is done using the socket; since the<br>
connection wire and the electrical connector can be received in the socket<br>
body. Furthermore the connection wire arid the electrical connector will not be<br>
lost. The messy problem is solved and the connection wire and the electrical<br>
connector will not disturb the user by being exposed or lost.<br>
For further understanding of the present invention, reference is made to<br>
the following detailed description illustrating the embodiments and examples<br>
of the .present invention. The description is for illustrative purpose only and is<br>
not intended to limit the scope of the claim.<br>

sliding slot 41. The two sliding slots 41 horizontally extend with a proper<br>
length. The electrical connector 4 can move forwards and backwards by<br>
extending or pushing back the connection wire 3 through the receiving slot<br>
.112, in order for the electrical connector 4 to assemble with the converting<br>
head 5. The pivoting portion 54 is received in the sliding slot 41 so that the<br>
electrical connector 4 is moyably assembled with the converting head 5. At the<br>
same time, the front end of the electrical connector 4 is plugged into the second<br>
plugging element 52 to be electrically connected. Therefore, the converting<br>
head 5 is electrically connected with the connection wire. 3 via the electrical<br>
connector 4.<br>
The converting head 5 is assembled with the electrical connector 4 by<br>
using a pivoting way (i.e. the sliding slot 41 connected with the pivoting<br>
portion 54 to allow for pivoting) and a slidable connecting way (i.e. sliding slot<br>
4.L. connected with the pivoting portion 54, which allows the converting head 5<br>
to slide in and connect with the electrical connector 4). There can be both a<br><br>
related rotation movement and-sliding movement between the electrical<br>
connector 4 and the converting head.,5; .so. that the converting head 5 can be<br>
plugged with the front end of the electrical connector 4 by using the sliding<br>
movement, and when the converting head 5 is not used, the converting head 5<br>
can be rotated to another direction by the rotation movement and then merely<br>
the electrical connector 4 is exposed for use. Therefore, the converting head 5<br>
does not need to be disassembled. It is convenient for the user. The structure of<br>
the converting head 5 is not limited to a specified type.<br>

that the charging base 7 can rotate against the panel 11. The rear side of the<br>
charging base 7 has a pin 71, and the front side of the charging base 7 has a<br>
connector 72. When the charging base 7 is used, the charging base 7 can be<br>
rotated with the panel 11 to make the charging base 7 be plugged with the<br>
plugging hole 121 of the socket unit 12 so that the pin 71 of the charging base 7<br>
is electrically connected with the pin 123 in the plugging hole 121 of the socket<br>
unit 12. Thereby, electric power is transmitted to the charging base 7 to charge<br>
the electronic equipment 6. When the charging base 7 is not used, the charging<br>
base 7 can be separated from the plugging hole 121 of the socket unit 12 so that<br>
the charging base 7 does not affect the usage of the plugging hole 121 of the<br>
socket unit 12.<br>
