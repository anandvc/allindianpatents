The present invention relates to an apparatus for producing an exhaust emission control honeycomb structure formed of a flat plate and a corrugated plate rolled in a superposed relation to each other, and particularly, to an improvement of an apparatus for producing an exhaust emission control honeycomb structure, which is designed so that a slurry containing a brazing material and a binder is applied to a corrugated metal plate before being rolled in order to bond a flat metal plate and the corrugated metal plate to each other.   QF THE RELATED ART<br>
Such an apparatus is conventionally known, for example, from Japanese Patent No.2,709,789.<br>
In the above conventionally known apparatus, a slurry containing a brazing material and a binder is applied to tops of a corrugated plate by a plurality of nozzles disposed in an opposed relation to the corrugated plate, but it is difficult to accurately supply the slurry to the tops of the corrugated plate by the nozzles.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to<br><br>
provide an apparatus for producing an exhaust emission control honeycomb structure designed so that a slurry can be supplied accurately and speedily to tops of opposite sides of a corrugated plate.<br>
To achieve the above object, according to a first aspect and feature of the present invention, there is provided an apparatus for producing an exhaust emission control honeycomb structure formed of a flat metal plate and a corrugated metal plate rolled in a superposed relation to each other, comprising a rolling means for rolling the flat plate and the corrugated plate in a superposed relation to each other, at least a pair of gears adapted to be meshed with opposite sides of the corrugated plate before being supplied to the rolling means and to be rotated synchronously with the movement of the corrugated plate toward the rolling means, and slurry supplying means for supplying a slurry containing a brazing material and a binder to tooth roots of the gears in order to apply the slurry to tops of the opposite sides of the corrugated plate.<br>
With such arrangement of the first feature, the slurry<br><br>
is supplied to the tooth roots of at least the pair of gears adapted to be meshed with the opposite sides of the corrugated plate and rotated synchronously with the movement of the corrugated plate. Therefore, when the tops of the corrugated plate are allowed to bite into the tooth roots supplied with the slurry, the slurry is deposited onto the tops of the<br><br>
corrugated plate. Thus, it is possible to supply the slurry accurately and speedily to the tops of the opposite sides of the corrugated plate.<br>
According to a second aspect and feature of the present invention, in addition to the first feature, the slurry supplying means is comprised of a tubular shaft which is formed into a cylindrical shape with a slurry passage defined therein for guiding the pressurized slurry and on which the gears are rotatably carried, a communication bore which is provided in a sidewall of the tubular shaft in correspondence to a position where the corrugated plate is clamed between the pair of gears and which communicates at its inner end with the slurry passage, and slurry supply bores provided in each of the gears in such a manner that their outer ends open into the tooth roots and their inner ends open into an inner peripheral surface of the gear, the slurry supply bores being provided in the gear at locations where the inner end of one of the slurry supply bores can be put into communication with the communication bore in response to the rotation of the gear.<br>
With such arrangement of the second feature, when one of the slurry supply bores has reached the position where its inner end can be put into communication with the communication bore in response to the rotation of the gear, the slurry is supplied from the slurry passage through the communication bore to the one slurry supply bore, and the communication bore is provided<br><br>
in the sidewall of the tubular shaft in correspondence to the position where the corrugated plate is clamped between the pair of the gears  Therefore, the slurry can be supplied only in an appropriate amount neither too much nor too less to the tops of the corrugated plate.<br>
According to a third aspect and feature of the present invention, in addition to the first feature, the slurry supply means is constructed to be able to supply the slurry from outside the gears to the tooth roots. With such arrangement, the slurry can be supplied to the tooth roots, while simplifying the internal construction of the gear.<br>
According to a fourth aspect and feature of the present invention, in addition to any of the first to third features, a recess is defined in each of the tooth roots for accumulation of the slurry. With such arrangement, when the tops of the corrugated plate are allowed to bite into the tooth roots supplied with the slurry, the tops of the corrugated plate can be brought into contact with the slurry over relatively large areas, whereby the slurry can be reliably deposited onto the tops of the opposite sides of the corrugated plate.<br>
According to a fifth aspect and feature of the present invention, in addition to any of the first to fourth features, a projection is provided on each of the tooth roots of the gear to protrude toward the corrugated plate . With such arrangement, when the tops of the corrugated plate are allowed to bite into<br><br>
the tooth roots of the gear supplied with the slurry, an increased pressure of contact of the slurry with the tops of the corrugated plate can be ensured, whereby the slurry can be reliably deposited onto the tops of the opposite sides of the corrugated plate.<br>
According to a sixth aspect and feature of the present invention, in addition to any of the first to fifth features, the slurry supplying means is constructed to be able to supply the slurry to tooth roots selected from the plurality of tooth roots provided on an outer periphery of the gear. With such arrangement, rather than the corrugated plate and the flat plate are bonded to each other at every tops of the corrugated plate, the every second or third or more tops of the corrugated plate are bonded to the flat plate. Therefore, it is possible to save the amount of slurry consumed, while moderating the thermal stress provided when a high-temperature exhaust gas flows through the honeycomb structure.<br>
According to a seventh aspect and feature of the present invention, in addition to any of the first to sixth features, the slurry supplying means is constructed to be able to supply the slurry to the tooth roots at a plurality of points spaced apart from one another in a direction of a rotational axis of the gear. With such arrangement, it is possible to make the bonding of the corrugated plate and the flat plate more reliable, while suppressing the amount of slurry consumed.<br><br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFFRRED EMBODIMENTS A first embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to Figs.1 to 5, Referring first to Fig.l, an exhaust emission control device 11 mounted in an exhaust system, for example, in a motorcycle, comprises a catalyst supported on a metal carrier 12. The metal carrier 12 is comprised of a honeycomb structure 13 inserted into a tubular case 14 made of a metal. Moreover, the honeycomb structure 13 is comprised of a flat metal plate 15 and a corrugated metal plate 16 rolled in a superposed relation to each other, and is made by a producing apparatus according to the present invention.<br>
Referring also to Figs .2 to 4, the apparatus for producing the honeycomb structure 13 includes a rolling means 17 for rolling the flat metal plate 15 and the corrugated metal plate 16 in the superposed relation to each other, at least a pair (two sets of pairs in the present embodiment) of gears 18A, which are adapted to be meshed with opposite sides of the corrugated plate 16 before being supplied to the rolling means 17, and to<br><br>
be rotated synchronously with the movement of the corrugated plate 16 toward the rolling means 17, and slurry supplying means 20A for supplying a slurry 19 containing a brazing material and a binder to bottoms 18a of the gears 18A to apply the slurry 19 to tops 16a on the opposite sides of the corrugated plate 16 . The corrugated plate 16 is revved around an idler 21 between the rolling means 17 and a location where the corrugated plate 16 is clamped between the gears ISA,<br>
For example, an aqueous thermosetting liquid plastic can be used suitably as the binder. In addition, it is desirable that a gear or a sprocket is used as the idler 21 in order to avoid the contact thereof with the slurry 19 deposited on the tops 16a of one of the sides of the corrugated plate 16.<br>
The slurry supplying means 20A is comprised of a tubular shaft 23 which is formed into a cylindrical shape with a slurry passage 22 defined therein and on which the pair of gears ISA, 18A disposed on one of the sides of the corrugated plate 16 are commonly rotatably carried, a slurry supply source 24 from which the pressurized slurry 19 is supplied to the slurry passage 22, a communication bore 25 which is provided in a sidewall of the tubular shaft 23 in correspondence to the location where the corrugated plate 16 is clamed between the pair of gears ISA, ISA, and which communicates at its inner end with the slurry passage 22, and a plurality of slurry supply bores 26 provided in the gear 18A, so that their outer ends open into tooth roots<br><br>
18a of the gear 18A and their inner ends open into an inner peripheral surface of the gear 18A.<br>
The communication bore 25 is provided in the sidewall of the tubular shaft 23 at a plurality of points (two points in the present embodiment) corresponding to an axially central portion of each of the gears 18A. On the other hand, the slurry supply bores 2 6 individually correspond to each of all the plurality of tooth roots 28a provided on the outer periphery of the gear ISA, and are provided in the gear ISA, so that an inner end of one of the slurry supply bores 26 is put into communication with the communication bore 25 in response to the rotation of gear ISA,<br>
Referring also to Fig.5, recesses 27 for accumulation of the slurry 19 supplied from the slurry supply bores 26 are provided in all the plurality of tooth roots 18a provided on the outer periphery of the gear ISA-According to the first embodiment, the two sets of pairs of gears ISA are meshed with the opposite sides of the corrugated plate 16 before being supplied to the rolling means 17 for rolling the flat plate 15 and the corrugated plate 16 in the superposed relation to each other, so that they are rotated synchronously with the movement of the corrugated plate 16 toward the rolling means 17, The slurry 19 containing the brazing material and the binder is supplied to the tooth roots 18a of the gears 18A by the slurry supplying means 20A, 20A.<br><br>
Therefore, when the tops 16a of the corrugated plate 16 are allowed to bite into the tooth roots 18a supplied with the slurry 19, the slurry 19 is deposited onto the tops 16a of the corrugated plate 16, In this way, it is possible to supply the slurry 19 accurately and speedily to the tops 16a on the opposite sides of the corrugated plate 16.<br>
In addition, the slurry supplying means 20A is comprised of the tubular shaft 23 which is formed into the cylindrical shape with the slurry passage 22 defined therein for guiding the pressurized slurry 19 and on which the gears 18A, 18A are rotatably carried, the communication bore 25 which is provided in the sidewall of the tubular shaft 23 in correspondence to the location where the corrugated plate 16 is clamed between the pair of gears 18A, 18A, and which communicates at its inner end with the slurry passage 22, and the slurry supply bores 26 provided in the gear ISA, so that their outer ends open into the tooth roots 18a of the gear ISA and their inner ends open into the inner peripheral surface of the gear 18A. The slurry supply bores 26 are provided in the gear 18A at positions where the inner end of one of the slurry supply bores 26 can be put into communication bore 25 in response to the rotation of the gear ISA.<br>
In other words, the slurry supplying means 20A is constructed so that when one of the slurry supply bores 26 has reached the position where the inner end thereof can be put into<br><br>
communication with the communication bore 25 in response to the rotation of the gear 18A, the slurry 19 is supplied from the slurry passage 22 through the communication bore 25 to the slurry supply bore 26. The communication bore 25 is provided in the sidewall of the tubular shaft 23 in correspondence to the location where the corrugated plate 16 is clamped between the pair of gears 18A, 18A. Therefore, it is possible to supply the slurry 19 only in an appropriate amount neither too much nor too less to the tops 16a of the corrugated plate 16,<br>
Moreover, the recesses 27 for accumulation of the slurry 19 supplied from the slurry supply bores 26 are provided in all the plurality of tooth roots 18a provided on the outer periphery of the gear 18A. Therefore, when the tops 16a of the corrugated plate 16 have bitten into the tooth roots 18a supplied with the slurry 19, they can be brought into contact with the slurry 19 over relatively large areas, whereby the slurry 19 can be reliably deposited onto the tops 16a on the opposite sides of the corrugated plate 16.<br>
Fig. 6 shows a second embodiment of the present invention. At least a pair of gears 18B, 18B adapted to be rotated synchronously with the movement of the corrugated plate 16 toward the rolling means 17 (see Fig,2 showing the first embodiment) are meshed with opposite sides of a corrugated plate 16 before being supplied to the rolling means 17. Projections 28 are provided on all of a plurality of tooth roots 18a provided<br><br>

According to the second embodiment, when the tops 16a of the corrugated plate 16 have bitten into the tooth roots 18a supplied with the slurry 19, an increased pressure of contact of the slurry 19 with the tops 16a on the opposite sides of the corrugated plate 16 can be ensured, whereby the slurry 19 can be reliably deposited onto the tops 16a on the opposite sides of the corrugated plate 16.<br>
Fig. 7 shows a third embodiment of the present invention. At least a pair of gears 18C, 18C adapted to be rotated synchronously with the movement of the rolling means 17 (see Fig.2 showing the first embodiment) are meshed with opposite sides of a corrugated plate 16 before being supplied to the rolling means 17. Projections 28 are provided on all of a plurality of tooth roots 18a provided on the outer periphery of each of the gears 18C, 18C to protrude toward the corrugated plate 16. Recesses 27 for accumulation of a slurry 19 supplied from slurry supply bores 26 provided in the gear 18C to constitute a portion of the slurry supplying means 20A are<br><br>
defined in tip ends of the projections 28.<br>
According to the third embodiment, the tops 16a of the corrugated plate 16 can be brought into contact with the slurry 19 over relatively large areas, and the pressure of contact of the tops 16a of the corrugated plate 16 with the slurry 19 can be increased, whereby the deposition of the slurry 19 on the tops 16a on the opposite sides of the corrugated plate is made more reliable.<br>
Fig. 8 shows a fourth embodiment of the present invention. At least a pair of gears 18D, 18D adapted to be rotated synchronously with the movement of the rolling means 17 (see Fig,2 showing the first embodiment) are meshed with opposite sides of a corrugated plate 16 before being supplied to the rolling means 17.<br>
