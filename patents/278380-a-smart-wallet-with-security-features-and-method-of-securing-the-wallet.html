 <br>
PRIORITY CLAIM<br>
[0001]	This patent application contains subject matter claiming benefit of the priority date of<br>
United States Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/972,608 filed on September 14, 2007, accordingly, the entire contents of this provisional patent application is hereby expressly incorporated by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
 Field of the Invention<br>
[0002]	The present invention pertains generally to wallets or billfolds with improved security<br>
features. More specifically, the present invention pertains to systems and methods for securing wallets while employing electronic features. The present invention is particularly, but not exclusively, useful as a smart wallet system and method with advanced features including bionietric authentication and an ability to transmit and receive electronic signals.<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
[0003]	In an age where electronic devices and transactions are prevalent, safe-guarding data<br>
has become an important issue, thus giving rise to a myriad of security systems. Two of the<br>
 <br>
cdmmon security systems used are password and personal identification (PIN) systems. Password systems require a user to provide the authentication system with a username and a password (both of which are unique to the user). PIN systems on the other hand usually require a user to provide a code, usually referred to as the PIN code, for authentication purposes. Both the password and the PIN system can prove to be a nuisance to users in the event they forget their password or PIN code. Moreover, a user-A can easily impersonate another user B if usctr A happens to get a hold of the password or PIN code (given either voluntarily or exploited through other means) of user B. One way to avoid such breaches of security is to implement a user-based physiological or behavioral characteristic as a means for authentication. This is the general idea behind biometrics.<br>
[0004]	Biometrics is the study of measurable biological characteristics. In computer<br>
security, biometrics refers to authentication techniques that rely on measurable physiological (e.g. face, fingerprint, hand, iris, or DNA) or behavioral (e.g. keystrokes, signature, or voice) characteristics that can be automatically checked.<br>
[0005]	In the above description, authentication is usually accomplished via a biometric<br>
device. A general description of the functionality of a biometrics device now follows. First, the biometric device captures a profile of the characteristic and next, a comparison of the acquired profile is made with a stored profile or template. Lastly, upon successful matching of the captured and stored profile, the user is interfaced with the application system requesting authentication.<br>
[0006]	Authentication based on fingerprint: One of the most common biometric techniques is<br>
the fingerprint, whereb users scan in a copy of their fingerprint and a comparison is performed by<br>
 <br>
the authentication device as to whether or not the input fingerprint matches that of a stored fingerprint corresponding to the same person. Some fingerprint authentication devices further provide a step of checking for a pulse to combat problems posed by false-authentication_via fingerprints that are not real.<br>
[0007]	. Authentication based on hand geometry: An authentication querying system captures<br>
the physical characteristics of a user's hand and fingers via a scanner and is matched with a stored template of the same user. Upon successful authentication, an action (like opening a secure door) is performed by the querying system.<br>
[0008]	Authentication based on retinal scanning: A scanner scans at close range a user's<br>
retina (the image forming innermost coat of the black part of the eye ball) using a low intensity light, creating an eye signature. The image is further matched to a stored retinal template, and a specific action is performed upon successful authentication. It should however be noted that failure of a user to focus correctly may provide an inaccurate result.<br>
[0009]	Authentication based on iris scanning: An iris scanner scans unique random patterns<br>
of the iris (the colored part of the eye) and authenticates users based on comparing the consistency of the acquired pattern with that of stored patterns. Unlike retinal scanning, close range interaction is not required.<br>
[0010]	Authentication based on facial recognition: A facial recognition system scans (the<br>
features of a users face) and captures an image of the user's face and compares it to a stored static<br>
 <br>
facial image of the same user. Upon successful authentication, a specific action is performed by the facial recognition system.<br>
[0011]	Authentication based on signature verification: This authentication technique utilizes<br>
a pressure sensitive pen and a tablet to record a user's signature. The system then compares it against stored samples of signatures corresponding to the same user, and upon authentication, performs a specific action.<br>
[0012]	Authentication based on voice recognition: Authentication in this technique is based<br>
on recognizing voice and speech characteristics (associated with a user) that are imperceptible and hence not replicable. Voice recognition systems typically require more memory for storing voice templates of users.<br>
[0013]	Therefore, biometrics are beginning to play a critical role in authentication and<br>
security. Biometrics authenticate the user not based on what he can remember (like passwords, PIN's, etc.), but rather use the user's characteristics (or who the user is) to perform authentication.<br>
[0014]	Wallets heretofore, have also been known. Some examples include U.S. Pat No.<br>
5,653,276, entitled COMBINATION WALLET AND BILLFOLD, to Niernberger; and U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2006/0273129, entitled WALLET SECURITY, to Horn.<br>
[0015]	Also recently, improvements in electronic tracking and inventory systems have been<br>
proposed that take advantage of the latest short range, low power technologies such as Bluetooth and<br>
 <br>
ZigBee. However, no similar proposals have been made that specifically address a person's wallet providing biometric authentication and electronic tracking.<br>
[0016]	In light of the above, it is an object of the present invention to provide a'Smart<br>
Wallet, or an iWallet, that proposes a biometric based authentication module to prevent a non-owner from accessing the device. It is further an object of the present invention to provide a secure wallet that is tamper resistant and water resistant. It is still further an object of the present invention to provide a smart wallet with electronic transmission and receiving capability to provide, for example indication when a secure wallet and a corresponding fob key are taken out of a preselected range. It is yet still further an object of the present invention to provide either a fob key device configured to fit onto or into a cellular telephone device, or alternatively configured to a key chain. It is an additional object of the present invention to provide a secure wallet with a USB port so that data can be retrieved, stored and programmed to the device via a personal or laptop computer. It is still another object of the present invention to provide a Smart Wallet system and method that is simple to use, yet easy to implement and comparatively cost effective.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0047]	Referring initially to Fig. 1, a smart wallet tracking system 100 is illustrated. First, a<br>
smart wallet 111 is provided having relatively low power, relatively short range, wireless transmission 115 capability. Second, an electronic fob 112 is provided also having wireless transmission capability configured to transmit and receive signals from the smart wallet 111. As an example, the fob key can be mated to a key chain 114 via loop 113, or alternatively, the fob key 112 could also be configured into or onto a cell phone 690 as illustrated in Figs. 6 A through 7C. for example.<br>
[0048]	System 100 is still further configured so that when wallet 111 and fob 112 are<br>
separated by a predetermined distance, for example ten (10) feet, the system 100 will provide audio and/or vibrational indication to both the wallet 111 and the fob 112. The audio indication could be provided, for example, by a sound generator 201,211, such as a buzzer or a speaker. Further, the vibrational indication could be provided by, for example, a miniature motor configured with a weight imbalance to cause vibration. The audio indication principle purpose is to alert an owner when the wallet 111 has been stolen, and further, the direction the wallet relative to the owner in the moments after a suspected theft.<br>
[0049]	As another alternative, fob 112 is configured with wireless transmission ability while<br>
the wallet itself includes only passive RFID; and therefore only the fob key 112 would alert a user when the wallet 111 goes out of range. In a preferred embodiment, the wallet 111 and fob key 112<br>
 <br>
range determination is achieved approximately by a relative signal strength detected by a receiver from either or both of the fob key 112 and the wallet 111.<br>
[0050]	Referring to Fig. 2 A, a block diagram 200 of exemplary hardware components is<br>
shown. In a preferred embodiment, a biometric reader is realized as fingerprint module 203. Microprocessor 204 controls the actions of the range detection, for example with sound generator 201 and vibrator 202, and also with authentication of the user via the fingerprint module 203. A Security Parameter Index (SPI) is associated with a wallet owner's biometric signature. Microprocessor 204 communicates to wireless module 205 via a General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO), for example, and includes antenna 206. It is preferred that both processor 204 and wireless module 205 are low power consuming and concurrent with the latest advancements in such electronics. Further, wireless module 205 is configured, according to for example, short range low power protocols as defined by either Bluetooth, ZigBee (IEEE 802.15.4), Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), or Ultra-Wideband (UWB).<br>
[0051]	Fig. 2B illustrates a fob key hardware block diagram 210 wherein a microprocessor<br>
215 is integrated with a wireless module. Similarly, the integrated processor and wireless module 215 control sound generator 211 and vibrator 212, and is electronically connected to antenna 216.<br>
[0052]	Fig. 2C shows software block diagram 230 for the smart wallet 111 of the present<br>
invention. It 230 comprises applications including registration, login, authentication, range detection 231, wireless stack 233, security library 232, biometric middleware 234, operating system 235, and device drivers 236. The operating system 235 includes all the services such as interprocess<br>
 <br>
communications, memory management, clock, and file system. Device drivers 236 include wireless, flash, I/O ports, timers, fingerprint reader, and others. Sitting on top of the OS 235 are the wireless communication stack 233, biometric library (middleware) 234, and security library 232. The application layer 231 includes applications such as sync, user regisration, user authentication, and range detection, for example.<br>
[0053]	Fig. 2D illustrates software block diagram 240 for the fob key 112 of the present<br>
invention. It 240 comprises applications including pairing and range detection 241, communications stack 242, system services and device drivers 243. Software on the electronic fob key 112 is simpler than software on the smart wallet 111. Accroding, no full featured operating system is provided but intead a simple round-robin loop, where each software module 241 242, 243 is given a time slice of a CPU.<br>
[0054]	Another embodiment 300 of a smart wallet is illustrated in Fig, 3 A in a closed or<br>
secure position. As shown, biometric reader 310 is configured to scan a fingerprint of a person attempting to access the wallet 300. LED 320 is designed to emit green when processor 204 recognizes the fingerprint as the owner of smart wallet 300. Also, a chime is emitted from sound generator 201 when a successful authentication is received. Additionally, LED 320 is designed to emit red light, and sound generator 201 will emit a warning buzzer, when the biometric reader 310 scans a fingerprint other than what the processor 204 recognizes as the owner. Still further, LED 32 is designed to emit amber light when battery power for the wallet 300 is below a threshold level and also sound generator 201 will emit an intermittent beeping sound. In a preferred embodiment. recharging of wallet battery power can be achieved via mini USB port 330 to a charger that plugs<br>
 <br>
into an AC power supply. Alternatively, a separate port for an AC adapter can be provided as a design choice.<br>
[0055]	Wallet 300 may be described as similar a cigarette case that is tamper resistant and<br>
opens up only biometrically, for example by fingerprint.   Wallet 300 can only be opened by the owner himself; and therefore, children, a spouse, roommates, etc. are denied access to contents thereof while the owner of the wallet is for instance sleeping, or in the bathroom.<br>
[0056]	Fig. 3A also shows antenna 340 and mini USB port 330. Figs. 3B through 3D further<br>
illustrate wallet 300 in various views. Wallet 300 in an open position is shown in Fig. 3B. An interior of the smart wallet 300 presents on its left side a plastic support clip 360 where one can put for instance, personal business cards 361. On an opposing right side, a leather compartment is provided with inner 351 and outer sections 353. Inner section 351 is designed to receive paper money 352 as shown in Fig. 3C. Outer section 353 is designed to receive credit cards, or similar items as shown in Figs. 3B and 3D. Also illustrated is a latch 370 used to secure wallet 300. In a preferred embodiment, latch 370 is controlled by a motor actuator, however other type actuators may be employed. Whatever choice of actuator, it is designed to de-energize shut, therefore, smart wallet 300 locking mechanism defaults into locked state when power is lost or in standby mode. In a preferred embodiment, battery power is minimized because latch control power is only applied to unlatch.<br>
[0057]	Figs. 4A and 4B further illustrate a smart wallet embodiment 111 as originally shown<br>
in Fig. 1. Here, an alternative latch 470 embodiment has been illustrated. Also, this embodiment<br>
 <br>
111 differs from the smart wallet 300 shown in Fig. 3 A in that two LEDs 4 3 5. 420 are provided. A first LED 420 can be dedicated to battery power indication and a second LED 415 provides indication of biometric access. Other physical features to note are antenna 440 and US 3 port 430. Also to note, card holder 469 for receiving cards 461 and plastic clip 460 for retaining piper money 452. Importantly, this embodiment 111 includes base relief 455 to assist in extraction of bills 452; as well as base relief 456 to assist in the extraction of cards at an interior portion of wallet 111. Further, the interior of the wallet 111 is exposed about hinges 480.<br>
[0058]	Yet further, another embodiment 500 of a smart wallet according to the present<br>
invention is shown in Figs. 5A through 5C. Similarly, it 500 comprises LED 520, USB port 530 and antenna 540 joining biometric reader 510. Also similarly, an interior portion of wallet 500 includes clip 560 for securing paper money 552 having base relief 555 to facilitate exvaction thereof. The interior portions are formed about hinges 580. However, this embodiment 500 is unique in that card holder 569 retains cards 561 at a slight tilt as illustrated in Figs. 5B and 5C.<br>
[0059]	Figs. 6A and 6B illustrate yet another embodiment 600 for a fob key of the present<br>
invention, however, this solution pairs the fob 600 to a cellular telephone 690 via a suitrable adhesive 787 (Fig. 7C). Fob 600, has a speaker 616, an LED 620 and also contains a battery compartment 686 and battery compartment cover 685.
