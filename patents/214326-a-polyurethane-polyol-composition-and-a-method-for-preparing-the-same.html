				<td>POLYURETHANE POLYOL COMPOSITIONS AND COATING COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING THE SAME<br>
This Invention relates to polyurethane polyof compositions comprising the reaction product of a polyisocyanate, a polyol, and a Guerbet alcohol having at least 12 carbon atoms, and to coating compositions comprising such polyurethane polyol compositions.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Polyurethane  polyol  compositions  comprising   the   reaction  product  of  a<br>
polyisocyanate, a polyol, and a monofunctional alcohol are generally known,<br>
e.g.,  from  patent publication WO 96/40813.  This  publication discloses  in<br>
general terms that the monofunctional alcohol can be linear or branched, cyclic<br>
or acyclic, and that the alcohols and thiols can be primary, secondary or<br>
tertiary.<br>
it is known to use polyurethane poiyol compositions as part of coating compositions and in multi-component coating systems. Such coating compositions and multi-component coating systems also comprise a Crosslin ker.<br>
It has  been found that polyurethane  poiyol compositions prepared  using "Guerbet alcohols having at least 12 carbon atoms result in polyurethane polyol   compositions which, when used in coating compositions and multi-component coatings systems, produce a finished coating that has surprisingly improved	monoalcohols having less than 12 carbon atoms. The finished coating shows /   <br><br>
better flexibility.) Additionally, the uncured polyurethane polyoi compositions have a lower VOC content and lower viscosity.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
In one embodiment, the current invention is a polyurethane polyoi composition<br>
comprising the reaction product of (a) po/ylsocyanate, (b) a pclyoi, and (c) a<br>
Guerbet alcohol having at least 12 carbon atoms or a Guerbet alcohol mixture<br>
having an average of at least 12 carbon atoms.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention encompasses a method of making such<br>
polyurethane polyoi compositions.<br>
The "invention is also directed to coating systems and coating compositions<br>
comprising such polyurethane polyoi composition and a crosslinker.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Polyisocyanates useful in the current invention typically have a functionality of 2 to 5. Due to variations in the preparation of such isocyanates, commercially available polyisocyanates may contain a mixture of functionalities. Such mixtures of polyisocyanates can be used in the current invention.<br>
Non-limiting examples of polyisocyanates useful in the current invention are 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate, isophorone diisocyanate, tetramethylxylylene diisocyanate, 2-methyl-1,5-pentane diisocyanate, 2,2,4-trimethyl-1,6-hexame-thylene diisocyanate, 1,12-dodecane diisocyanate, methylene bis(4-cyclohexyl isocyanate), the biuret of 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate, the isocyanurate of 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate, the isocyanurate of isophorone diisocyanate, and the triisocyanate functional adduct of tetramethyl xylene diisocyanate and trimethylolpropane. The preferred polyisocyanate is the isocyanurate of hexa-methylene diisocyanate (isocyanurate of HDI).<br><br>
Non- limiting examples of polyols useful in the current invention are a, (3 and a, y diols^ and mixture thereof, for instance 2-ethyl-l,3-hexane did, 1 ,2-hexane diol, 1,2-octane diol, 1 ,2- decane diol, 2,2,4-trimethyl-l ,3 pentane diol, and 2-butyl-2-ethyl-2,3-propane diol, and mixture thereof<br>
Guerbet alcohols are branched, primary monofunctional alcohols that have two linear carbon chains with the branch point always at the second carbon position. Guerbet alcohols are chemically described as 2-alkyl-l-alkanols. The Guerbet alcohol used in the current invention is an alcohol having at least 12 carbon atoms or a Guerbet alcohol mixture having an average of at least 12 carbon atoms. The Guerbet alcohol preferably used in the current invention is one having at least 16 carbon atoms or a Guerbet alcohol mixture having an average of at least 16 carbon atoms. Preferably, the Guerbet alcohol used in the current invention is one having not more than 36 carbon atoms, more preferably not more than 32 carbon atoms. The most preferred Guerbet alcohols are 2-hexyl-1 -decanol, 2-octyl-l -decanol, 2-octyl-l -dodecanol, 2-hexyl- 1-dodecanol, 2-decyl-1-tetradecanol, and mixtures thereof The Guerbet alcohols used according to the present invention may be represented by the following formula: (R1) (R2) CHCH2OH<br>
wherein<br>
R1 is a linear alkyl group,<br>
R is a linear alkyl group,<br>
the sum of the carbon atoms in R1 and R2 is 10 to 34, and<br>
both R1 and R2 are present.<br>
Guerbet alcohols are commercially available from Sasol Chemie GmbH as IsofolÂ® alcohols and from Cognis as Guerbetol.<br>
The polyurethane polyol compositions of the current invention can be combined   with crosslinkers to produce coating compositions. Any hydroxyl group-reactive<br><br>
crosslinker may be employed in the coating compositions and multi-component coating systems of the current invention, for non-limiting example, polyisocyanates, blocked polyisocyanates, urea, and melamine resins. Mixtures of such crosslinkers may also be used. Melamine crosslinkers are chosen for one-package coating systems and isocyanates are typically used in two component systems.<br>
The coating composition can also comprise catalysts for the curing reaction between the hydroxyl groups in the polyurethane polyol composition and the hydroxyl-reactive group of the crosslinker. For non-limiting examples with isocyanates as crosslinkers, dibutyl tin dijaurate, triethyl amine, and metal catalysts and the like are preferred. Non-limiting examples for aminoplast crosslinkers include sulfonic acid catalysts like blocked dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid. The coating compositions can also contain pigments. Inorganic as well as organic pigments may be used. The composition can further comprise conventional additives, such as stabilizers, surfactants, fillers, UV-absorbers, and various additives and solvents.<br>
The coating composition of the present invention can be applied to any substrate. The substrate may be, for example, metal, plastic, wood, glass, ceramic, or another coating layer. The other coating layer may be comprised of the coating composition of the cun"ent invention or it may be a different coating composition. The coating composition of the current invention shows particular utility as clear coats, base coats, and pigmented top coats. The coating compositions can be applied by conventional means such as by spray gun, brush or roller, spraying being preferred. Curing temperatures preferably are between 0_and 130Â°C and more preferably between 20 and 120Â°C. The compositions are particularly suitable in the preparation of coated metal substrates, in particular transportation vehicles such as trains, trucks, buses, and airplanes.<br><br>
Due to the flexibility of the resulting cured coating, the coating composition of the present invention is particularly useful for flexible plastic substrates and on articles that are a combination of plastic and other materials.<br>
The invention is further illustrated by the following examples.<br>
EXAMPLES:<br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
A 2-liter, 4-neck round-bottomed flask equipped with a stirrer, a condenser, a heating mantel, a thermocouple, a Masterflex peristaltic pump, and a nitrogen inlet was charged with:<br>
480.0 g        2-butyl-2-ethyl propane diol, 228.9 g        n-butyl acetate,<br>
0.5 g        10% solution dibutyl tin dilaurate in n-butyl acetate.<br>
This mixture was heated to 70Â°C under a nitrogen blanket. When the mixture reached 70Â°C, the following isocyanate solution was added over a 2-hour period using a Masterflex peristaltic pump:<br>
588.0 g	Desmodur N-3300 (isocyanurate of HDI) and<br>
228.9 g	n-butyl acetate.<br>
After completion of the isocyanate. addition, the reaction temperature was maintained at 70Â°C for an additional 2 hours, at which point Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to determine that there was no residual isocyanate. The resulting solution of polyurethane polyol was a resin solution having a non-volatile content of 66.7% wt and a Brookfield viscosity of 1,420 cps.<br><br>
Example 2<br>
A 2-liter, 4-neck round-bottomed flask equipped with a stirrer, a condenser, a heating mantle, a thermocouple, a dropping funnel, and a nitrogen inlet was charged with:<br>
588.0 g	Desmodur N-3300 (isocyanurate of HDI)<br>
234.45 g       n-butyl acetate, and<br>
0.5 g	10% solution dibutyl tin dilaurate in n-butyl acetate<br>
The mixture was heated to 70Â°C under a nitrogen blanket. When the mixture reached 70Â°C, 186.0 g 2-butyl-1-octanol (lSOFOL-12 from Sasol Chemie GmbH) were added through the dropping funnel over a one-hour period. During the addition, the reaction temperature w is maintained between 70Â°C and 75Â°C. After the addition, the resulting prejsdv/mer was maintained at 70Â°C for an additional hour.<br>
A separate 3-liter, 4-neck round-bottomed flask equipped with a stirrer, a condenser, a heating mantle, a themnocouple, a Masterflex peristaltic pump, and a nitrogen inlet was charged with:<br>
320.0 g	2-butyl-2-ethyl propane diol and<br>
234.45 g       n-butyl acetate.<br>
This mixture was heated to 70Â°C, and then the prepolymer prepared above was added over a 2-hour period using a Masterflex peristaltic pump. The reaction temperature was maintained between 70Â°C and 75Â°C. After completion of the prepolymer addition, the reaction temperature was maintained at 70Â°C for an additional 2 hours, at which point it was determined by FTIR that there was no indication of residual isocyanate.<br><br>
The properties of the resulting polyurethane poiyol are reported in Table 2.<br>
Examples 3 through 6 and Comparative Examples 7 through 10 The polyurethane poiyol compositions of Examples 3 through 6 and Comparative Examples 7 through 10 were prepared according to the procedure of Example 2 using the reactants and amounts indicated in Table 1. The total amount of n-butylacetate used in each Example is given in Table 1. In each Example, half the total amount is used to prepare the prepolymer and half is used to prepare the polyurethane poiyol. All monoalcohol substitutions are at the same molar level. The properties of the resulting polyurethane poiyol compositions are reported in Table 2.<br>
Comparative Example 11<br>
An acrylic poiyol v/as prepared by conventional free radical polymerization typically used in the coatings industry. The properties of the resulting acrylic poiyol are given in Table 2.<br>
Coating compositions<br>
Clear coat coating compositions were prepared with melamine resin Cymel 303 commercially available from Cytec Industries and polyurethane poiyol compositions of Comparative Examples 1, 7, 8, and 11 and Examples 2 through 6 according to the following formulation:<br>
70.0 g       .   polyurethane poiyol (based on resin solids)<br>
28.9 g	Cymel 303 (based on resin solids)<br>
1.0 g	blocked dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid (based on actives)<br>
0.1 g	Byk 310, silicone flow agent (based on actives)<br>
Preparation of test panels and coating properties:<br>
Using a #44 draw down bar, the clear coats were applied on 4" x 12" (10.16 cm<br>
to 30.48 cm) Bonderite 1000 steel panels commercially available from ACT<br><br>
Laboratories and then baked at 121Â°C for 30 minutes. The target dry film thickness was 1.0 Â± 0.1 mil (25.4 Â± 2.5 microns). After the bake, the following properties were tested on the panels:<br>
â¢	Room Temperature Conical Mandrel Flexibility (1/4" to 2" (0.635 cm to 5.08 cm) mandrel diameter): GM 9503P<br>
â¢	Reverse Impact (40 inch-pound): Chrysler LP-463PB-19-01<br>
Further, acid etch testing was conducted as follows:<br>
Using a #44 draw down bar the clear coats were applied on 3" x 18" (7.62 cm x 45.72 cm) black E-coated steel panels and then baked at 250 F (12rC) for 30 minutes. The target dry film thickness was 1.0 Â± 0.1 mil (25.4 Â± 2.5 microns). After the bake, the panels were placed on a gradient temperature bar ranging from 60Â°C to 90Â°C. When the pane s reached thermal equilibrium with the gradient bar, a 10% wt solution of aqueous sulphuric acid was spotted along the panel in 3Â°C increments. The panels were exposed to the acid and temperature gradient for 30 minutes and then rinsed with distilled water. The temperature at which the first signs of etching are visible and the severity of etch at 77Â°C are reported.<br>
Table 3 summarizes these test results. It should also be noted that the clear coat formulations using the polyol of Comparative Examples 7 and 8 crystallized after sitting for 1 day.<br>
One component, melamine cured clearcoat compositions based on the polyurethane polyols of Examples 2 and 3, were applied to plastic substrates (TPO). Prior to the application of the clearcoat, each TPO substrate was coated with an adhesion promoter and a one component basecoat. Visual observations after bending of the coated substrate confinned that these coating compositions on flexible substrates have surprising resistance to cracking.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
