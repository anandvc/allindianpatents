				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to novel 3-<br>
triazolylphenyl sulfide derivatives and insecticides,<br>
miticides and nematicides for agricultural and<br>
horticultural containing them as an active ingredient.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
As known insecticides, miticides and nematicides, 3-<br>
triazolylphenyl sulfide derivatives as disclosed in<br>
Patent Document 1 have already been known. It is<br>
disclosed that the group of compounds as disclosed in the<br>
document have high effects against mites when directly<br>
sprayed over plants. However, the document does not<br>
disclose a soil treatment. The group of compounds as<br>
disclosed in the document have insufficient migration in<br>
the soil and infiltration into plants by a soil treatment.<br>
Accordingly, no sufficient effects may be obtained in<br>
some cases, due to non uniform spraying with chemicals,<br>
transpiration, photolysis, outflow of the chemicals by<br>
rain, etc.<br>
At- present, very few miticides having practical soil<br><br>
treatment activity have been known. Chemicals applicable<br>
to a soil treatment are advantageous to farmers in view<br>
of higher safety, more saving of labor, etc. Accordingly,<br>
development of miticides having soil treatment activity<br>
has been required.<br>
Patent document 1: JP-A-2000-198768<br>

MEANS OF SOLVING THE PROBLEMS<br>
The present inventors have synthesized various 3-<br>
triazolylphenyl sulfide derivatives and studied their<br>
physiological activities to develop insectides, miticides<br>

When a compound of the present invention is used as<br>
the active ingredient of a pesticide, it may be used by<br>
itself. However, it can be formulated into various<br>
formulations such as an emulsifiable concentrate, a<br>
suspension, a dust, a granule, a tablet, a wettable<br>
powder, a water-soluble concentrate, a solution, a<br>
flowable suspension, a water dispersible granule, an<br>
aerosol, a paste, an oil formulation, a concentrated<br>
emulsion in water and a smoking agent in combination with<br>
various carriers, surfactants and other adjuvants which<br><br>
are commonly used for formulation as agricultural<br>
adjuvants. They are blended usually in such proportions<br>
that the active ingredient is from 0.1 to 90 wt% and the<br>
agricultural adjuvants are from 10 to 99.9 wt%.<br>
The carriers to be used for such formulation may be<br>
classified into solid carriers and liquid carriers. The<br>
solid carriers include, for example, animal and plant<br>
powders such as starch, activated carbon, soybean powder,<br>
wheat flour, wood flour, fish flour and powdered milk,<br>
and mineral powders such as talc, kaolin, bentonite,<br>
calcium carbonate, zeolite, diatomaceous earth, white<br>
carbon, clay, alumina, ammonium sulfate and urea. The<br>
liquid carriers include, for example, water; alcohols<br>
such as isopropyl alcohol and ethylene glycol; ketones<br>
such as cyclohexanone and methyl ethyl ketone; ethers<br>
such as dioxane and tetrahydrofuran; aliphatic<br>
hydrocarbons such as kerosene and light oil; aromatic<br>
hydrocarbons such as xylene, trimethylbenzene,<br>
tetramethylbenzen, methylnaphthalene and solvent naphtha;<br>
halogenated hydrocarbons such as chlorobenzene; acid<br>
amides such as dimethylacetamide; esters such as glycerin<br>
esters of fatty acids; nitriles such as acetonitrile; and<br>
sulfur-containing compounds such as dimethyl sulfoxide.<br>
The surfactants include, for example, metal salts of<br>
alkylbenzenesulfonic acids, metal salts of<br>
dinaphthylmethanedisulfonic acids, salts of alcohol<br>
sulfates, alkylarylsulfonates, lignin sulfonates,<br><br>
polyoxyethylene glycol ethers, polyoxyethylene alkyl aryl<br>
ethers, and polyoxyethylene sorbitan monoalkylates.<br>
The other adjuvants include, for example, adhesive<br>
agents and thickeners such as carboxymethylcellulose, gum<br>
arabic, sodium arginate, guar gum, tragacanth gum, and<br>
polyvinyl alcohol, antifoaming agents such as metal soap,<br>
physical property improvers such as fatty acids, alkyl<br>
phosphate salts, silicone and paraffin and coloring<br>
agents.<br>
When these formulations are practically used, they<br>
may be used directly or after diluted with a diluent such<br>
as water to a predetermined concentration. Various<br>
formulations containing the compounds of the present<br>
invention, whether diluted or not, may be applied by<br>
conventional methods, i.e., application methods (such as<br>
spraying, misting, atomizing, dusting, granule<br>
application, paddy water application and seeding box<br>
application), soil treatment (such as mixing or<br>
drenching), surface application (such as painting,<br>
dressing and covering), dipping, poison bait or smoking.<br>
Further, the above active ingredients may be incorporated<br>
into livestock feeds so as to prevent infestation or<br>
growth of pest, especially pest insects after they are<br>
voided in excrement. Otherwise, they can also be applied<br>
in low volume at high concentration, when the active<br>
ingredient may be contained up to 100%. The proportion<br>
of the active ingredient is suitably selected if<br><br>
necessary, and it is properly from 0.1 to 20% (by weight)<br>
in the case of a dust or a granule, and from 1 to 30% (by<br>
weight) in the case of an emulsifiable concentrate or a<br>
wettable powder.<br>
The pesticides of the present invention are applied,<br>
when they are diluted with a diluent, usually at an<br>
active ingredient concentration of from 0.1 to 5,000 ppm.<br>
When they are used directly, the dose per unit area is<br>
from 0.1 to 5,000 g per 1 ha in terms of the compound<br>
that serves as the active ingredient. However, the dose<br>
is not limited to such specific range.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are<br>
sufficiently effective when used alone. However, they<br>
may be used, if necessary, in combination or in admixture<br>
with fertilizers or other agrochemicals such as<br>
insecticides, miticides, nematicides, fungicides,<br>
antivirus agents, attractants, herbicides and plant<br>
growth regulants, and such combined use can sometimes<br>
produce improved effects.<br>
