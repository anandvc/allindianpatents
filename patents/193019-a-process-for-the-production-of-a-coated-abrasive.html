a  process  for	a<br>
This  invention  relates  to/the  production  of/coated  abrasive <br>
and  specifically  to  the  chirring  of  resin  coats  by  which  an<br>
abrasive  grit  is  adhered  to  a  backing  material  in  the  production<br>
of  coated  abrasives.<br>
In  a  typical  coated  abrasive  manufacturing  process  a  backing material,   which  has  frequently  been  treated  with  a  filler  coating to  make  it  a  better  substrate  for  the  application  of  a  binder solution,   is  coated  with  a  binder  resin  formulation  called  a maker  coat.     Abrasive  particles  are  applied  to  the  coated  backing which  is  then  treated  to  cure  the  maker  coat  at  least  to  the extent  necessary  to  hold  the  particles  firmly  in  place.     The coated  product  thereafter  is  often  given  a  further  binder  coat, usually  called  a  size, coat,   that  improves  the  strength  of  the bond  holding  the  abrasive  particles  to  the  backing.     This  size coat  can  also  act  as  a  vehicle  for  the  application  of  a  grinding aid  or  other  additive  to  modify  the  grinding  performance  of  the coated  abrasive.     The  size  coat  is  then  cured.<br>
The resins most frequently used as vehicles for maker .and size coats have typically been based on modified or unmodified phenolic  resins.     While  other  binders  have  been  suggested,   they<br><br>
are  subject  to  problems  of  control,   expense  and  environmental impact  such  that  they  are  not  universally  attractive.<br>
While  these  alternative  binders  have  their  problems,   there are  also  significant  problems  arising  from  the  use  of  phenolic resins  in  such  applications.<br>
The  first  problem  arises  from  the  fact  that  they  are  used  in the  form  of  aqueous  dispersions  containing  about  3 0-4 0%  of  water which  must  be  removed  before  cure  can  occur.     This  drying process,   if  performed  too  quickly  or  at  too  high  a  temperatxire, can  result  in  blisters  and  bubbles  being  formed  in  the  bond material  which  severely  reduce  the  bond  strength.     Thus  typically the  drying  process  is  protracted  and  costly  but  must  be essentially  complete  before  curing  can  begin.<br>
The  phenolic  bonding  resins  when  first  applied,   are  lightly or  not  at  all  cross-linked.     During  cure  they  are  increasingly cross-linked  and  become  more  and  more  rigid  as  a  result.     The cure  process   is   advanced  to  different  degrees  at  the  various stages  of  the  manufacture  of  a  coated  abrasive.     The  initial  cure of  the  maker  coat  is  advanced  only  to  the  extent  necessary  to ensure  that  it  remains  dimensionally  stable  and  holds  the abrasive  grits  in  place  during  subsequent  "post-cure"  processing. The  backing  with  the  abrasive  grains  held  by  a  partially  cured maker  coat  is  then  frequently  provided  with  a  size  coat  that  is most  often,   but  not  essentially,   chemically  similar  to  the  maker coat.     This  provides  most  of  the  grain  retention  function.     This size  coat  must  be  dried  and  partially  cured  till  it  can  be  safely rolled  without  the  overlying  laps  sticking  to  one  another.     The rolls  are  then  conventionally  placed  in  a  controlled  temperature environment  to  complete  the  cure.     Because  the  rolls  develop  taken  to  ensure  that  this  gradient  is  minimized  to  ensure uniformity  of  cure  throughout  the  roll.     This  can  take  days  to<br><br>
accomplish  and  implies  that  a  huge  amount  of  "fork-in-progress" inventory  is  established.     This  is  a  source  of  great inefficiencies.<br>
The  problems  in  adequately  and  uniformly  curing  the  binder resins  derive  in  part  from  the  nature  of  the  cure  process  and  the time  needed  to  take  the  resin  to  the  desired  degree  of  cross-linking.     In  order  to  ensure  the  uniformity  of  the  cure,   the  time is  frequently  measured  in  hours  rather  than  minutes.     Typically the  drying  and  partial  cure  of  the  maker  and  size  coats  is carried  out  in  ovens  while  draped  over  slats  so  as  to  hang  in folds.     These  ovens,   which  are  often  referred  to  as   "festoon ovens",   have  to  be  very  large  to  accommodate  the  hanging  folds and  need  to  be  in  the  form  of  temperature  controlled  zones  held at  temperatures  appropriate  to  drying  or  curing  operations.     The curing  zones  are  held  at  high  temperatures  for  quite  long  periods to  ensure  controlled  cure  to  the  correct  extent.     Moreover  such ovens  are  required  not  only  to  dry  and  partially  cure  the  maker coat  but  also  to  dry  and  partially  cure  the  size  coat  that  is typically  applied  over  it.     Only  after  the  correct  level   of  cure of  the  top  coating  layer,   (usually  the  size  layer) ,   has  been obtained  are  the  sheets  rolled  up  and  "post-cured"  to  the  final desired  level  in  that  form.     Drying  and  curing  is  therefore  a very  expensive  operation  in  the  production  of  coated  abrasives.<br>
Moreover  the  use  of  festoon  ovens  can  lead  to  localized defects  at  the  points  where  the  sheets  pass  over  the  supporting slats.     Stagnant  air  spots  inside  the  oven  between  the  folds  can also   lead  to  uneven  heating  of  the  sheets  and  uneven  cure profiles  across  the  sheets.<br>
The  present  invention  provides  a  novel  way  of  heat-curing<br>
This  technique  can  readily  be  controlled,   requires  a  fraction  of the  time  to  achieve  the  same  degree  of  cure  and  potentially<br><br>
eliminates the need for festoon ovens altogether. This process is therefore capable of radically speeding up the production process and of significantly reducing the costs involved.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the production of a coated abrasive comprising a backing material and abrasive grits secured to the backing material using one or more coatings of a thermosettable binder resin formulation in which at least part of the cure of at least one of the binder resin coatings is achieved by means of dielectric heating.<br><br>
Description  of  the  Invention<br>
The  present  invention  provides  a  process  for  the  production of  a  coated  abrasive  comprising  abrasive  particles  adhered  to  a backing  material  by  one  or'more  binder  coats  comprising  a  heat-curable  resin,  wherein  the  binder  coats  are  cured  by  dielectric heating.<br>
The  term  binder  coat  is  used  herein  to  cover  maker,   size and,   where  used  super size  coats.     The  unifying  featxore  is  that each  contains  a  thermoset  resin  component  that  needs  to  be  cured in  the  course  of  producing  the  coated  abrasive  final  product.<br>
The  term  "dielectric  heating"  refers  to  heating  by  means  of radio  frequency  or  microwave  frequency  waves  which  directly excite  polar  components  within  the  material  heated  thereby generating  heat  which  is  transmitted  to  the  rest  of  the  material. Radio  frequency  heating  is  known  in  general  and  operates  on frequencies  from  about    I  to  about  100  MHz.     In  the  United States,   the  Federal  Communications  Commission,   (FCC),   licenses the  unshielded  use  of  assigned  radio  frequencies  such  as  13,   27 and  40  MHz,   but  other  frequencies  can  be  used  provided  the equipment  is  shielded  so  that  the  use  of  these  frequencies  does not  interfere  with  other  equipment  that  operates  in  the  same range.       Microwave  heating  is  of  course  very  well  known  in,   for example, • cooking  in  which  the  microwaves  excite  water  and  other polar  molecules  in  the  foodstuff  and  produces  uniform  and  rapid cooking.     Microwaves  usually  operate  in  a  somewhat  higher  range of  frequencies  of  from  about  500  to  about  15000  MHz.     For example,   the  FCC  has  assigned  914  and  2450  MHz  for  use  in microwave  heating  in  unshielded  environments.<br><br>
In  coated  abrasive  application  the  binder  resins  used  are commonly  thermoset  resins  in  an  aqueous  medium-     This  makes  them ideal  to  be  cured  by  use  of  dielectric  heating  because  of  the polar  nature  of  water.     The  dielectric  frequencies  used  will speedily  heat  up  the  water  uniformly  and  the  heat  will  initiate the  thermosetting  reaction  as  the  water  is  removed  by evaporation.     However  as  more  cross-linking  occurs,   the  effective loss  factor   (E")   is  reduced  as  the  molecules  become  less  mobile and  there  is  less  capability  for  interaction  with  the  dielectric heating.     The  efficiency  of  heating  is  therefore  reduced.     As  a result  it  is  desirable  to  incorporate  into  the  binder  an  inert material  that  is  a  polar  material  and  will  act  as  a  means  of conveying  heat  to  the  material  to  complete  the  cure  to  the required  degree.<br>
While  it  is  possible  to  use  dielectric  heating  exclusively to  bring  about  the  cure  of  a  resin  binder,   it  is  often  desirable to  use  dielectric  heating  to  complete  cure  of  a  resin  binder  that has  been  dried  and  partially  cured  by  other  cure  techniques.      In one  form  of   such  an  operation  a  semi-cured  coated  abrasive material   is  rolled  into  a  "jumbo"  roll  and  is  then  subjected  to the  dielectric  cure.     The  dielectric  heating  technique  is particularly  suited  to  heating  a  jumbo  since  it  lends  itself  to  a much  higher  degree  of  uniformity  of  heating  throughout  the  roll and  the  heating  is  essentially  instantaneous.<br>
Alternatively  or  perhaps  additionally,   dielectric  cure  can be  used  to  cure  a  binder  resin  layer  that  has  been  dried  by  other techniques.     In  such  a  process  the  sheet  having  a  resin  layer from  which  at  least  the  greater  part,   and  preferably substantially  all,   of  the  water  has  been  removed  is  passed  "in¬line"   through  a  dielectric  heating  device  in  which  the  cure  is advanced  to  the  desired  degree.     This  technique  is  particularly preferred  when  associated  with  the  use  of  high  efficiency directed  hot  air  driers  that  are  capable  of  eliminating  the  water<br><br>
from  a  phenolic  resin  binder  to  render  it  non-tacky  in  a  matter of  minutes.     Such  a  dryer  may  incorporate  a  plurality  of  directed high  velocity  hot  air  jets.     The  air  flow  and  the  temperatures are  preferably  profiled  so  as  to  ensure  gradual  uniform  heating and  water  removal  while  minimizing  turbulence  and  disruption  of the  surface  of  the  sheet.     While  high  pressure  air  removes  the water,   the  sheet  may  be  carried  on  low  pressure  hot  air  bearings to  minimize  physical  contact  with  hard  surfaces  during  the  drying phases.     This  cooperation  permits  the  design  of  an  in-line process  that  does  not  need  festoon  ovens  with  their  attendant problems  as  discussed  above.<br>
In  dielectric  heating  the  power  dissipated,   P,   is  determined by  the  following  equation:<br>
P     =     5.56   X  V  X  f  X  E’  X  E"   X   10-"  watts<br>
where  V  is  the  volume  of  the  material  in  cubic  meters; f  is  the  frequency  in  Hz;<br>
E  is  the  electric  field  strength  in  volts/m,   that  is  the applied  voltage  across  the  plates  divided  by  their separation;   and<br>
E"   is  the  "effective  loss  factor"  that  varies  with  the material.     The  effective  loss  factor  consists  of  losses  due to  polarization  and  conductivity  such  that: E"   =  E"a(w)   +  E"Jw)   +  E".(w)   +  EV(v)   +  S/E„.w       and =  E"(w)' +  S/Eg.w In  the  above  equations  the  subscripts  "d",   "e",   "a"  and  "mw" refer  to  dipolar,   electronic,   atomic  and  Maxwell-Wagner polarization  losses  respectively.     The  last  term  represents  the loss  due  to  conductivity  and  in  that  term  "S"is  the  conductivity of  the  material;   "E’"  is  the  dielectric  constant  of  free  space and  "w"   is  the  angular  frequency.     The  loss  mechanisms  that  are most  important  in  the  frequency  band  of  industrial  high  frequency heating  are  the  dipolar,   Maxwell-Wagner  and  the  d.c.<br><br>
conductivity.<br>
Each  material  in  the  coated  abrasive  formulation  that  is being  heated  will  have  its  own  heating  rate  which  will  be determined  by  the  dielectric  loss  factor  of  the  material.     For most  non-polar  materials  for  which  E"  is  typically  very  low,   this heating  rate  will  be  very  small.     However  if  materials  are  added that  have  a  very  high  value  for  E"  or  conductivity,   then  they will  rapidly  heat  up  and  transfer  the  heat  to  the  mistier  and specifically  the  thermosettable  resin  thereby  advancing  the  cure of  the  resin.     Such  materials  are  referred  to  hereafter  as "dielectric  fillers".     Because  the  degree  of  cure  of thermosettable  resins  is  typically  a  temperature  dependant function,   and  since,   given  uniform  distribution  of  the  dielectric filler  throughout  the  coated  abrasive  and  providing  there  is negligible  heat  loss  at  the  surface,   the  temperature  reached  will be  the  same  at  the  surface  as  in  the  interior.     It  is  therefore possible  to  monitor  the  surface  temperature  to  control  the  degree of  cure  as  desired.     Moreover,   because  the  heating  is  essentially instant,   the  dielectric  heating  can  be  switched  on  and  off  to keep  the  cure  temperature  essentially  constant  in  response  to  a simple  surface  temperature  sensor.<br>
Thus  in  one  embodiment  of  the  invention,   it  is  possible  to use  dielectric  heating,  particularly  in  conjunction  with  a dielectric  filler,   to  dry  and  cure,   or  more  preferably  to  simply cure  a  dried  maker  resin  "on-line"  to  the  required  degree,   (so that  the  coated  abrasive  sheet  being  produced  can  be  further treated  and  so  that  the  abrasive  grains  will  not  easily  become detached),   and  subject  it  directly  to  a  size  coat  treatment without  first  experiencing  a  prolonged  residence  in  a  festoon oven.     Indeed  the  size  coat  treatment  can  be  applied  essentially "in-line".     This  coat  can  then  be  dried  and     cured  using similar  techniques  to  ensure  the  resin  is  no  longer  sticky  and then  rolled  up  into  large  rolls  known  as  "jumbos"  which  may  then<br><br>
be  unrolled  and  subjected  to  a  final  dielectric, cure  operation before  being  rolled  again.     It  is  possible  in  some  circiamstances to  perform  all  the  final  cure  in  the  rolled-up  form.     This  would be  impossible  using  conventional  direct  heat  crier  methods  decease of  the  temperature  gradient,    (and  therefore  extent  of  cure variation),   that  inevitably  develops  within  the  roll  unless uneconomically  slow  rates  of  heating  are  adopted.<br>
By  eliminating  the  festoon  oven  curing      the  time needed  for  producing  a  completely  cured  coated  abrasive  roll ready  for  conversion  into  commercial  coated  abrasive  materials such  as  belts  or  discs  can  be  significantly  reduced  from  10  hours to  a  matter  of  minutes.     Moreover  the  uniformity  of  the  product is  greatly  enhanced  and  the  reject  material  associated  with  the parts  of  the. sheet  in  contact  with  the  slats  used  to  support  the folds  in  the  festoon  ovens  is  completely  eliminated.<br>
The  thermoset  resin  used  in  the  binder  formulation  is usually  a  phenolic  resin  and  the  phenolic  resin  most  frequently selected  is  a  resole  though  novella  resin  can  also  be  used  in some  circumstances-     Other  thermoset  resins   such  as ihelamine/formaldehyde,   urea/formaldehyde,   epoxy  resins  such  as epoxy-novellas,   thermosetting  polyesters,   and  the  like  may  also be  used.<br>
The  dielectric   fillers  added  to  provide  the  increased  E" factor  may  vary  widely  but  some  are  particularly  preferred because  they  can  serve  a  dual  function.     For  example  some materials  can  act  also  as  an  inert  filler  to  reduce  the  amount  of resin  required  and  some  act  as  grinding  aids  to  enable  the abrasive  grits  to  cut  more  effectively  or  more  coolly.     Some other  materials  can  act  as  anti-blocking  additives  to  reduce  any buildup  of     Ly  static  charges  on  th-E  surface of  the  coated  abrasive.<br><br>
There  are  two  types  of  dielectric  fillers:<br>
1.	Fillers  that  increase  the  E"  of  the  system  by  conductivity  and Maxwell-Wagner  polarization  mechanisms.     These  fillers  are conductive  in  nature  and  include  for  example  carbon  black, graphite  and  conductive  quaternary  ammonium  salts;   and<br>
2.	Fillers  that  increase  the  E"  of  the  system  by  dipole polarization  mechanisms.     Such  fillers  have  a  high  E"  value  which is  understood  to  be  a  value  in  excess  of  about  2,   such  as  from about  2   to  about  900,   and  preferably  from  about  10  to  about  3 00.<br>
To  demonstrate  the  effect  of  various  filler  materials,   20  ml of  a   liquid  epoxy  resin,    (DGEBA-EPON  825,   Peon  is  a  registered Trademark  of  Shell  Chemical  Company),   without  a  curing  agent  was mixed  5%   by  weight  of  filler  and  the  sample  was  placed  between parallel  plates  electrodes,    (38  mm  separation),   for  20  seconds. The  initial  and  final  temperatures  were  measured  using  a thermometer.     The  results  obtained  with  seven  fillers  is  shown  in Table  1  below.<br>

From  the  data  on  Table  1  it  would  appear  that  only  graphite  and the  quaternary  ammonium  salt  were  effective.     When  the  same resin/filler  mixtures  are  dielectrically  heated  with  a  curing agent,    (diethylenetriamine)   present  in  the  mixture,   similar results  were  obtained  though  the  other  fillers  appeared  to increase  the  final  temperature  marginally.     In  this  series  of tests  the  resin  system  with  blended-in  filler,    (10  wt%),   was allowed  to  cure  at  room  temperature  for  15  hours  before  being radio-frequency  heated  between  parallel  plates  with  a  25.4  mm  gap for  30  seconds.     Again  the  initial  and  final  temperatures  were measured  though  this  time  using  an  optical  pyrometer.     The results  appear  in  Table  2.<br>

The  incorporation  of  a  filler  can  also  have  a  very  significant effect  on  the  dielectric  loss  of  a  resin.     Clearly  the  greater the  dielectric  loss  the  more  susceptible  to  dielectric  cure  the mixture  becomes.     To  illustrate  this  point  10  wt%  of  various fillers  was   incorporated  into  an  acrylic  resin  system,    (Ebacryl 616,   available  under  that  trade  name  from  UCB  Radcure  Inc.   with 1%  of  a  photoinitiator,   CGI  17 00,   available  from  Ciba-Geigy) . The  mixture  was  cvired  using  UV  radiation.     Each  sample  was subjected,   at  a  temperature  of  IIS’C  to  a  dielectric  field  at  two<br><br>
different  levels  and  the  Dielectric  Loss   (E")   was  measured.     The results  appear  in  Table  3  below.<br>

The  loss  factor,   (E"),   of  barium  titanate  is  55  at  a frequency  of  100  MHz.     By  contrast  the  E"   of  a  phenolic  resin under  the  same  conditions  is  about  0.04  to  about  0.16.     It  will be  appreciated  therefore  that  the  amount  of  heating  directly absorbed  by  the  resin  as  a  result  of  exposure  to  the  dielectric heating,    (as  opposed  to  heating  from  adjacent  dielectric  filler particles),   is  very  small.<br>
The  amount  of  the  dielectric  filler  that  is  added  may  vary according  to  the  E"  factor  and  according  to  the  amount  that  can be  tolerated  in  the  formulation  without  interfering  with  the binding  function  of  the  resin.     Generally  however  the  amount  can vary  from  about  1  to  about  70  and  preferably  from  about  10  to about  50%  by  weight  of  a  binder  formulation  where  the  E"   factor of  the  dielectric  filler  is  above  2.       Of  course  the  higher  the E"   factor,   the  less  is  required  for  the  primrose  of  heating. However  to  achieve  the  purpose  stated  above,   the  dielectric filler  should  be  evenly  distributed  throughout  the  binder<br><br><br>
of  a  fine powder but in some cases a filler  in fine  filamentary form may  be  advantageous.<br><br>
The  coated  abrasives  produced  by  the  process  of  the invention  can  use  any  type  of  abrasive  grit  or  mixtures  of  such grits  in  any  desired  grit  size.     Some  grits  have  some  advantage for  use  in  the  process  of  the  invention  since  they  have  a  E" factor  higher  than  that  of  the  resin  and  can  therefore  actually aid  in  the  curing  process.     This  is  usually  a  minor  contribution however  and  the  nature  of  the  grit  is  likewise  usually  a  minor consideration.     Grits  such  as  alumina,   (both  the  fused  and sintered  varieties),   alumina/zirconia  abrasives,   silicon  carbide, silicon  nitride  and  the  like  can  be  used.     Super abrasives  such  as diamond  or  cubic  boron  nitride  can  also  be  used  but  the  cost  of such  materials  usually  requires  that  they  be  used,    (if  at  all) , in  combination  with  other  less  expensive  abrasive  materials.<br>
The  nature  of  the  backing  can  be  chosen  from  a  wide  range  of materials   including  woven  and  non-woven  fabrics,   including stitch-bonded  fabrics,   made  from  natural  or  synthetic  fibers. Paper  or  plastics  materials  of  suitably  heavy  weight  may  also  be used  in  some  limited  applications.<br>
Description  of  Preferred  Embodiments<br>
The  invention  is  now  further  described  with  reference  to  the following  Examples  which  are  for  the  purpose  of  illustration  only and  should  not  be  taken  as  implying  any  necessary  limitation  on the  essential  scope  of  the  invention.<br>
Example   1<br>
In  this  Example  two  coated  abrasives  were  prepared.     Both employed  a  paper  backing,    (170  lb  Aromatic  Paper),   and conventional  phenolic  resins  in  both  mace  and  size  coats.      In each  case  the  maker  coat  contained  52%  of  a  phenolic  resin formulation,   6.5%  of  a   latex  rubber  and  42%  of  a  calcium uurbuiidte  filler,   all  prcporticns  being  by  right.     The  maker coat  was   applied  at  3.5   lb/ream,    (51.89  g/m’) .      (A  "ream"   is  an<br><br>
area  measurement  corresponding  to  36.67  square  yards  or  30.66 square  meters).<br>
The abrasive that was UP-coated over the maker coat of each was a conventional fused alminium oxide and the application rate was  5  lb/ream,   (74.13  g/m’) .<br>
Both  materials  used  the  same  size  coat  formulation  which comprised  80%  of  a  phenolic  resin  formulation  and  20%  of  a calcium  carbonate  filler,   both  proportions  being  by  weight.     The size  coat  was  applied  at  a  rate  of  3  lb/ream,   (44.48  g/m’) .<br>
The  difference  lay  in  the  addition  of  8.8%  by  weight  of graphite  to  the  size  coat.     This  addition  rendered  dielectric heating  significantly  more  effective.<br>
Both  samples  were  taken  from  a  commercial  production  run after  application  and  partial  curing  of  the  size  coat.     The processes  compared  are  therefore  the  different  techniques  for completing  the  cure  of  the  binder  resins  which  is  normally  done in  jumbo  rolls.<br>
Each  of  Samples  #1  and  #2  was  divided  into  two  sub-samples;   ITC and  IDC;   and  2TC  and  2DC.     The  sub sample’  labelled  TC  were thermally  cured  in  a  conventional  way  and  those  labelled  DC  were dielectrically  cured.<br>
Thermal  Cure<br>
Samples  that  were  thermally  cured  were  placed  in  an  oven held  at  120°C  for  a  period  of  two  hours.     The  samples  were   in  the form  of  one  foot  wide  strips  rather  than  rolls  to  accelerate  the cure  process.<br>
Dielectric  Cura<br>
The  subsamples  that  were  dielectrically  cured  were  passed<br><br>
between  staggered  upper  and  lower  rows  of  electrodes  which  had  a vertical  distance  between  the  rows  of  2.54  cm.     The  rows  of electrodes  were  contained  within  an  Applicator  that  was  4  ft, (1.22  m) ,   long  by  1.5  ft,   (45.7  cm),   wide  and  the  space  within the  Applicator  was  maintained  at  about  eCC  using  auxiliary  air heating.     The  frequency  applied  across  the  electrodes  was  40  MHz and  a  20kw  output  was  used.     The  current  delivered  to  the Applicator  was  about  1-2  amps.<br>
Subsample  #1DC  was  moved  backward  and  forward  between  the electrodes  for  3  minutes  at  1.2-1.3  amps.     Subsample  #2DC,    (which contained  the  graphite) ,   received  only  two  minutes  of  the  same treatment.<br>
The  four  subsamples  were  analyzed  using  differential scanning  calorimetric  and  were  all  found  to  have  been  fully  cured under  the  above  conditions.<br>
The  cured  samples  were  then  made  into  abrasive  discs  and were  subjected  to  the  Schaefer  Test  in  which  4.5   inch   (11.4  cm) diameter  discs  are  used  to  grind  the  end  of  a  2.54   cm  diameter aluminum  pipe.     The  discs  were  evaluated  based  on  the  weight  loss of  the  disc  after  standard  period  of  grinding.     The  higher  the weight  loss,   the  less  effectively  the  grain  is  held  by  the  binder resin.     The  results  obtained  were  as  follows:<br>
Subsample  #1TC	0.12g	Subsample  #2TC	0.32g<br>
Subsample  #1DC	0.19g	Subsample  #2DC	0.37g<br>
From  this  data  it  can  be  seen  that  the  dielectric  cure  gave a  product  that  was  comparable  to  that  produced  by  the  traditional thermal  cure  but  in  2-3  minutes  as  opposed  to  2  hours.     This represents  a  tremendous  advantage  when  translated  to  a  commercial    be  observed  that  full  euro  in  the Subsample  #2DC  was  obtained  in  only  two  thirds  the  time  taken  for<br><br>
the  subsample  without  the  graphite  addition  to  fully  cure.<br>
While  this  demonstration  relates  to  the  post-curing  process, it  is  quite  clear  that  it  could  be  readily  adapted  to  other aspects  of  the  production  process  for  coated  abrasives  in  which the  binder  used  is  adapted  to  be  covered  by  radiofrequency  heating.<br><br><br>
