"ENGINE STARTING SYSTEM FOR VEHICLE"<br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA., a corporation of Japan,   1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br><br>
ORIGINAL<br>
1219/MUM/2001<br><br><br><br>
GRANTED<br>
30/11/2007<br><br>
The present invention relates to engine starting system for vehicle.<br>
The present invention  relates to ah engine starting system for a vehicle which starts an engine using a starter motor, and more particularly to an engine starting system for a vehicle that prevents the engine from causing back-kick when starting the engine. [0002] [Prior Art]<br>
When a starting operation is carried out after a resolution speed of an engine is reduced with an engine ignition being inhibited, and the engine is reignited at a very low engine speed immediately before being stopped, a piston is pushed back by an explosion force due to the reignition before reaching a top dead center. This causes a large load to be applied to a power train line between a crankshaft and the starter motor and at the same time, causes a noise to be generated. Such a phenomena is generally called "kick-back". [0003]<br><br><br>
In order to reduce the kick-back noise generated when starting the engine, in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No.187766/1985, for example, a technology is proposed which inhibits an operation of an ignition system (causes a misfire) until a revolution speed of the engine reaches up to a specified revolution speed.<br>
[0004]<br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
The back-kick is liable to occur when an igniting condition is satisfied immediately before an engine is stopped. Therefore, in the above described prior art, an engine revolution speed was obtained on the basis of a time required for one revolution of the engine to force the engine to cause misfire when thus obtained engine speed is lower than a specified threshold value.<br>
[0005]<br>
However, in the low revolution region for deciding propriety of the forced misfire, there is a large variation in the engine revolution speed. Hence, the decision of propriety of the forced misfire, which is to be carried out on the basis of the engine revolution speed obtained from the time required for one revolution of the engine, necessitated to set the threshold value high in anticipation of errors due to varying components. This made a misfire control to have been carried out from a relatively high revolution region to<br><br>
sometimes make the starting of the engine require a certain time. In addition, the threshold value having been set rather high necessitated the starter motor to be large-sized for making the revolution speed of the engine increased up to the threshold value in a short time.<br>
[0006]<br>
While, from viewpoints of environmental problem and energy saving, there has been developed and distributed in the market a vehicle that mounts an automatic engine stopping and starting system which stops the igniting operation of the engine ignition system in response to a specified stopping condition while the vehicle is running, and after the igniting operation is stopped, restarts the igniting operation in response to a specified starting operation. In a vehicle that mounts such an automatic engine stopping and starting system, the starting operation is liable to be carried out in a stopping process in which the engine in running is brought to a state of being stopped to easily cause the above-described back-kick.<br>
[0007]<br>
It is an object of the present invention to solve the above-described problems and provide an engine starting system for a vehicle which can surely prevent the back-kick when starting the engine from occurring without making the starter motor large-sized, and can quickly start the engine.<br><br>
[0008]<br>
[Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
In order to achieve the above object, the invention is, in an engine starting system for a vehicle comprising a starter motor for cranking an engine in response to a specified starting operation, and an ignition system for igniting the engine at a specified rotated angle in response to the above-described starting operation, characterized in that the engine starting system includes engine revolution speed detecting means for dividing a compression stroke immediately before an ignition timing into a plurality of sections for detecting an engine revolution speed in each of the sections, and a back-kick avoiding means for inhibiting engine ignition for a specified period irrespective of the above-described starting operation when the engine revolution speed in each of the above-described sections is in a specified relation of magnitude with others.<br>
[0009]<br>
Here, according to results of experiments by the inventors and the like of the invention, reduction in the engine revolution speed down to a low revolution region where the back-kick is liable to be caused reduces sharply the engine revolution speed particularly in a compression stroke before the top dead center. Therefore, by dividing the compression stroke into a plurality of sections, detecting an engine revolution speed in each of the sections, and comparing it with<br><br>
others, it becomes possible to exactly make a decision as to whether or not the engine revolution speed is reduced down to the low revolution region where the back-kick is liable to be caused.<br>

[Modes for Carrying Out the Invention]<br>
in the following, the invention will be explained in detail with reference to drawings. Fig. 5 is a whole side view of a motorcycle mounting an engine stopping and starting control system according to the invention. A front body 2 and a rear body 3 are connected with a low floor part 4 and a framework of a body is constituted by a body frame including a down tube 6 and a main pipe 7. A fuel tank and a luggage box (both not shown) are supported by the main pipe 7, above which a seat 8 is arranged. The seat 8 can also serve as a lid of the luggage box provided there under. The luggage box is constituted to be freely opened and closed by means of a hinge mechanism provided at a front part FR thereof.<br>
[0011]<br>
At the front body 2, a steering head 5 is provided onto<br>
the down tube 6. By the steering head 5, a front fork 12A is<br>
pivotally supported.  At a top end of the front fork 12A<br>
extending upward, there is mounted a handlebar 11A. While,<br>
at a bottom end thereof, a front wheel 13A is pivotally<br>
supported. An upper part of the handlebar 11A is covered with<br><br><br>
a handle cover 33 also serving as an instrument panel.<br>
[0012]<br>
At a midpoint of the main pipe 7, there is pivotally supported a linking member (hunger) 37 in being rotatable. By the hunger 37, a swing unit 17 is coupled to the main pipe 7 for being supported thereon in being swingable. On the swing unit 17, there is mounted a single cylinder four cycle engine 200 at the front part thereof. From the engine 200 to the rear, there is constituted a belt type non-stage transmission 35, at the rear part of which a rear wheel 21 is pivotally supported on a reduction gear mechanism 38 provided via a centrifugal clutch. Between a top end of the reduction gear mechanism 38 and an upper bent portion of the main pipe 7, there is mounted a rear cushion 22.<br>
[0013]<br>
At the front part of the swing unit 17, there is connected an intake pipe 23 extended from a cylinder head 32 of the engine 200. To the intake pipe 23, there is further arranged a carburetor 24 and an air cleaner 25 coupled to the carburetor 24. To a pivot 18 provided under a swing unit case 31, there is pivotally attached a main stand 26. At parking, the main stand 26 is made stood (shown in the figure with a chain line).<br>
[0014]<br>
Fig. 1 is a cross sectional view of the first embodiment of the above-described swing unit 17 and shows a structure in<br><br>
cross section taken along the plane A - A in the above-described Fig. 5. Fig. 2 is a cross sectional view of the swing unit 17 on a vertical plane including an axis of a crankshaft 12. The above-described swing unit 17 comprises the engine 200, a generator unit section G coupled to one end of the crankshaft 12, and a driving section ATI and a driven section AT 2 of an automatic transmission coupled to the other end of the crankshaft 12.<br>
[0015]<br>
In the swing unit case 31, there is provided the crankshaft 12 rotatably supported by main bearings 10 and 11. To the crankshaft 12, a connecting rod 14 is coupled through a crank pin 13. At an end of the crankshaft 12 overhanging from a crankcase 9, there is provided a generator 44.<br>
[0016]<br>
To an outer rotor 42 of the generator 44, a sleeve 57A, one (on the crankshaft side) of a one-way (one-directional) clutch 50, is secured by means of screws 43. The other sleeve 55a (on a sprocket side) is rotatably supported integrally with a sprocket 58 in between the generator 44 and a main bearing 11 on the crankshaft 12. With the sprocket 58, a chain 40 is engaged for obtaining cranking torque from the starter motor 49.<br>
[0017]<br>
A clutch section 56a of the above-described one-way<br><br>
clutch 50 prevents the outer rotor 42 of the generator 44, i.e. the crankshaft 12, from slippingly rotating in the reverse direction relatively to the sprocket 58, but permits its slipping rotation in the normal direction. Therefore, when the above-described starter motor 49 is driven when starting the engine to drive the sprocket 58 in the direction of normal rotation of the crankshaft 12, the crankshaft 12 follows this to be also driven in the direction of the normal rotation.<br>
[0018]<br>
Compared with this, after the engine has been started, even when the starter motor 49 is stopped, the crankshaft 12 slippingly rotates with respect to the sprocket 58. Therefore, no driving force of the crankshaft 12 is transmitted to the starter motor 49.<br>
[0019]<br>
Onto the crankshaft 12, a sprocket 59 is fixed between the above-described sprocket 58 and the main bearing 11. With the sprocket 59, a chain 60 is engaged for obtaining power for driving a camshaft 69 from the crankshaft 12. The sprocket 59 is integrally formed with a gear 61 for transmitting power to a pump (not shown in the figure) for circulating lubricating oil.<br>
[0020]<br>
A piston 63 arranged in a cylinder 62 is coupled to a small end side of the connecting rod 14. Into the cylinder<br><br>
head 32, a spark plug 65 is screwed to be fixed, with an electrode section thereof facing a combustion chamber formed between the head of the piston 63 and the cylinder head 32. The circumference of the cylinder 62 is surrounded by a water jacket 66.<br>
[0021]<br>
Above the cylinder 62 in the cylinder head 32, the camshaft 69 is rotatably supported, to which a cam sprocket 72 is fixed. With the cam sprocket 72, the above-described chain 60 is engaged. By means of the chain 60, the revolution of the above-described sprocket 59, i.e. the revolution of the crankshaft 12, is transmitted to the camshaft 69.<br>
[0022]<br>
Above the camshaft 69, rocker arms 73 are provided, which perform a rocking motion in compliance with the cam shape of the camshaft 69. The cam shape of the camshaft 69 is determined so that an intake valve 95 and an exhaust valves 96 are opened and closed in compliance with specified strokes.<br>
[0023]<br>
At the end on the crankshaft 12 on the side opposite to the side on which the generator 44 is provided, there is provided a pulley 83 for engaging a V belt 82 around therewith. The pulley 83 comprises a fixed pulley piece 83a whose motions in the rotational direction and in the axial direction are fixed with respect to the crankshaft 12, and a movable pulley piece<br><br>
83b which is freely movable in the axial direction with respect to the crankshaft 12. Onto the back face of the movable pulley piece 83b, i.e. the face without being contacted with the V belt 82, there is attached a holder plate 84. The holder plate 84 is restricted in its movement with respect to the crankshaft 12 both in the rotational and in the axial directions to rotate integrally therewith. A blank space surrounded by the holder plate 84 and the movable pulley piece 83b forms a pocket for holding a roller 85 as a governor weight.<br>
[0024]<br>
On the back face of the fixed pulley piece 83a, i.e. the face out of contact with the V belt 82, there is integrally formed a fan 83c. Over an opening of the swing unit case 31 opposing the above-described fan 83c, there is mounted an air cleaner cover 70 provided with an air cleaner 71 for cleaning cooling air and introducing it into an automatic transmission chamber. The above-described fan 83c is formed so as to suck outside air into the automatic transmission chamber through the air cleaner 71 when the crankshaft 12 rotates normally.<br>
[0025]<br>
In the driven section AT2 of the automatic transmission, on a main shaft 125 of a clutch, there is supported a fixed pulley piece 132a of a pulley 132. At an end of the main shaft 125, a cup-like clutch disk 134 is fixed thereto with a nut 133 . On a sleeve 135 of the above-described fixed pulley piece<br><br>
132a, a movable pulley piece 132b is provided slidably in the longitudinal direction of the main shaft 125. The movable pulley piece 132b engages with a disk 136 so that the movable pulley piece 132b can rotate in one piece therewith around the main shaft 125. Between the disk 136 and the movable pulley piece 132b, a compression coil spring 137 is provided whose repulsive force acts in the direction of increasing the distance between the disk 136 and the movable pulley piece 132b. The main shaft 125, an idle shaft 142 and a power shaft 145 engage with one another by means of gears respectively provided thereon. A rim 21a of the rear wheel 21 is fixed to the above-described power shaft 145.<br>
[0026]<br>
As described above, according to the embodiment, the starter motor 49 and the crankshaft 12 are coupled by the chain 40 as endless coupling means to make the crankshaft 12 chain-driven when starting the engine. This can suppress starting noise due to the starter motor 49 lower compared with previous one.<br>
[0027]<br>
In addition, as in the embodiment, when the generator 44 and the pulley 83 of the automatic transmission are provided on both sides of the crankshaft 12, respectively, with the crankcase 9 between, an occupied region in the axial direction on the crankshaft 12 becomes larger in that of the pulley 83<br><br>
of the automatic transmission than in that of the generator 44. Consequently, a length of the crankshaft on each of the sides with the crankcase 9 between also tends to become longer on the side of the pulley 83 than on the side of the generator 44. Compared with this, in the embodiment, since the sprocket 58 and the one-way clutch 50 thereof are provided on the side of the generator 44, the crankshaft lengths on both sides with the crankcase 9 between can be made equal for making it possible to stabilize balance in rotation.<br>
[0028]<br>
Furthermore, according to the embodiment, the chain 40 for coupling the crankshaft 12 and the starter motor 49, and the chain 60 for coupling the crankshaft 12 and the camshaft 69 can be brought together on one side of the engine to improve maintainability.<br>
[0029]<br>
Subsequent to this, an automatic engine stopping and starting system according to the embodiment will be explained. The system comprises an operation mode for permitting idling (hereinafter referred to as a "starting &amp; idle switch (SW) mode"), and an operation mode for restricting (or inhibiting) the idling (hereinafter referred to as a "stopping and starting mode").<br>
[0030]<br>
In the "starting &amp; idle switch (SW) mode" for permitting<br><br>
idling, for the purpose of carrying out a warming-up operation when starting the engine or the like, idling is temporarily permitted after the first starting of the engine after turning on the power. Besides after the above-described first starting of the engine, idling is permitted by an intention of the driver (the idling SW made "on").<br>
[0031]<br>
While, in the "stopping and starting mode" by which the idling is restricted, the engine is stopped when a vehicle is stopped, and when an accelerator is operated in the stopped state, the engine is automatically restarted to make it possible to start the vehicle.<br>
[0032]<br>
Fig. 8 is a block diagram showing a whole configuration of the automatic engine stopping and starting system, with the same reference numerals and signs denoting the same or equivalent components.<br>
[0033]<br>
The crankshaft 12 is coaxially provided with the generator (AC generator 44). The electric power generated by the generator 44 is charged in a battery 168 through a regulator rectifier 167. The regulator rectifier 167 controls an output voltage of the generator 44 at 12V to 14.5 V. The battery 168, on conduction of a starter relay 162, supplies a driving current to the starter motor 49 and, along with this, supplies load<br><br>
currents to various kinds of general electrical equipment 174, a main control unit 160, and the like through a main switch 173.<br>
[0034]<br>
To the main control unit 160, there are connected a pulser 153 for detecting ignition timing and the engine revolution speed Ne, an idle switch 253 for permitting or limiting the idling of the engine 200 by the intention of a driver, a seating switch 254 closing contacts to output a signal in an "H" level when the driver is seated on a seat, a vehicle speed sensor 255 detecting a vehicle speed, a stand-by indicator 256 flashing in the above "stopping and starting mode", a throttle sensor 257 (including a throttle switch 257a) detecting a throttle opening angle 6, a starter switch 258 for driving the starter motor 49 for cranking the engine 200, a stop switch 259 outputting a signal in an "H" level in response to braking operation, a battery indicator 276 lighting up when the voltage of the battery becomes equal to or below a specified value (for example, 10 V) to warn the driver of insufficient charging, and a water temperature sensor 155 detecting a temperature of cooling water of the engine.<br>
[0035]<br>
Furthermore, to the main control unit 160, there are connected an ignition system (including an ignition coil) 161 igniting the spark plug 65 in synchronism with the rotation<br><br>
of the crankshaft 12, a control terminal of the starter relay 162 supplying electric power to the starter motor 49, a control terminal of a headlight driver 163 supplying electric power to a head light 169, and a control terminal of a by-starter relay 164 supplying electric power to a by-starter 165 mounted on a carburetor 166. The above-described headlight driver 163 is constituted of switching elements such as FETs, and employs so-called chopping control which turns on and off the switching elements with a specified period and duty ratio to substantially control an applied voltage to the headlight 169.<br>
[0036]<br>
Figs. 9, 10, and 11 are a series of block diagrams (No.l, No.2, and No.3 thereof) functionally showing a configuration of the main control unit 160, with the same reference numerals as those in Fig. 8 denoting the same or equivalent parts.<br>
[0037]<br>
In Fig. 12, there are listed details of control in each of a starter relay control section 400, a by-starter control section 900, a stand-by indicator control section 600, a headlight control section 800, and a charging control section 500, which constitute the main control unit 160.<br>
[0038]<br>
In Fig. 9, an operation switching section 300, when a state of the idle switch 253, a state of the vehicle and the like are in specified conditions, switches an operation mode<br><br>
of the main control unit 160 to either the "starting &amp; idle SW mode" or the "stopping and starting mode".<br>
[0039]<br>
To an operation mode signal output unit 301 of the operation switching section 300, there is inputted a state signal of the idle switch 253. The state signal of the idle switch 253 presents an "L" level in a turned off state (idling restricted), and an "H" level in a turned on state (idling permitted). The operation mode signal output unit 301, in response to output signals of the idle switch 253, the vehicle speed sensor 255, and the water temperature sensor 155, outputs an operation mode signal S301 which specifies the operation mode of the main control unit 160 as being either the "starting &amp; idle SW mode" or the "stopping and starting mode".<br>
[0040]<br>
Fig. 13 is a diagram schematically showing switching conditions of the operation modes by the operation mode signal output unit 301. When the main switch 173 is thrown and the main control unit 160 is made reset (condition 1 is satisfied), the operation mode signal S301 is brought into "L" level to start the "starting &amp; idle SW mode".<br>
[0041]<br>
Further, in the "starting &amp; idle SW mode" , when a vehicle speed equal to or above a specified speed (for example, 10 kilometers per hour) is detected, a water temperature is equal<br><br>
to or above a specified temperature (for example, a temperature from which completion of engine warming-up is predicted), and idle switch 253 is turned off (condition 2 is satisfied), the operation mode signal S301 is brought to cause transition from the "L" level to the "H" level to start the "stopping and starting mode".<br>
[0042]<br>
Moreover, in the "stopping and starting mode", when the idle SW is brought from "OFF" to "ON" (condition 3 is satisfied), the operation mode signal S301 is brought to cause transition from the "H" level to the "L" level to return the operation mode from the "stopping and starting mode" to the "starting &amp; idle SW mode". In either the "starting &amp; idle SW mode" or the "stopping and starting mode" , when the main SW 173 is turned off (condition 4 is satisfied), the main control unit 160 is brought into an off state.<br>
[0043]<br>
Returning to Fig. 9, the starter relay control section<br>
400	starts the starter relay 162 under a specified condition in compliance with the above described operation modes. To an equal to or below cranking revolution speed decision unit<br>
401	and an equal to or below idling revolution speed decision unit 407, a detection signal of the pulser 153 is inputted. The equal to or below cranking revolution speed decision unit 401 outputs a signal in an "H" level when the engine revolution<br><br>
speed is equal to or below a specified cranking revolution speed (for example, 600rpm). The equal to or below idling revolution speed decision unit 407 outputs a signal in an "H" level when the engine revolution speed is equal to or below a specified idling revolution speed (for example, 1200rpm).<br>
[0044]<br>
An AND circuit 402 outputs a logical product of an output signal of the equal to or below cranking revolution speed decision unit 401, a state signal of the stop switch 259, and a state signal of the starter switch 258. An AND circuit 404 outputs a logical product of an output signal of the equal to or below idling revolution speed decision unit 407, a detection signal of the throttle switch 257a, and a state signal of the seating switch 254.<br>
[0045]<br>
An AND circuit 403 outputs a logical product of an output signal of the above-described AND circuit 402 and an inverted signal of the operation mode signal S301. An AND circuit 405 outputs a logical product of an output signal of the above-described AND circuit 404 and the operation mode signal S301. An OR circuit 406 outputs a logical sum of respective output signals of the above-described AND circuits 403 and 405 as a starting signal Sin. A starting signal extension section 407, when the pulse width of the starting signal Sin is shorter than a specified reference time, extends this to be equal to<br><br>
or longer than the reference time for being outputted to the starter relay 162.<br>
[0046]<br>
The starting signal extension section 407 includes a multivibrator 407a that detects the starting signal Sin to output a one-shot pulse signal, and an OR circuit 407b that outputs a logical sum of the above-described starting signal Sin and the output signal of the multivibrator 407a as a starting signal Sout after the extension. The above-described multivibrator 407a can extend the pulse width of the output pulse as desired in compliance with a resistance value of a variable resistor.<br>
[0047]<br>
Fig. 14 is a timing chart showing an operation of the above-described starting signal extension section 407. The variable resistance value of the multivibrator 407a is set so that the pulse width of the output pulse becomes 0.6 seconds irrespective of the pulse width t on of the starting signal Sin. Therefore, even when the starter switch 258 is turned on only for a period shorter than 0.6 seconds, the width of the output pulse of the multivibrator 407a becomes 0.6 seconds.<br>
[0048]<br>
Furthermore, since the OR circuit 407b outputs a logical sum of an output pulse of the multivibrator 407a and the starting signal Sin, the output signal Sout of the starting<br><br>
signal extension section 407 becomes a signal with the pulse width of 0.6 seconds when the pulse width t on of the starting signal Sin is shorter than 0.6 seconds, and when the pulse width t on of the starting signal Sin is longer than 0.6 seconds, becomes a signal with such a pulse width.<br>
[0049]<br>
Incidentally, in the above-described embodiment, the explanation was made in which the pulse width of the starting signal is to be extended up to 0.6 seconds. The invention, however, is not limited only to this, but optimum setting of the pulse width is necessary in compliance with a revolution speed and a reduction ratio of the starter motor 49.<br>
[0050]<br>
Namely, as shown in Fig. 20, when the engine is made stopped, its piston has a high probability of stopping in a compression stroke immediately before reaching a compression top dead center (TDC). Then, when the starter motor 49 is driven from this state at the next starting of the engine, at a position of the piston immediately before the compression TDC where the piston reaches right after the starting, no ignition is provided in the engine and explosion first occurs when the piston is positioned before the next compression TDC. Therefore, the starter motor 49 must rotate the engine so that the piston reaches at least the compression TDC next to the compression TDC right after the starting of the engine.<br><br>
[0051]<br>
However, when the starter motor 49 is stopped at the time when the piston reaches near the above-described compression TDC next to the compression TDC right after the starting of the engine, an explosion load acts in the direction of a reversed rotation to cause the reversed rotation of the crankshaft 12, i.e. so-called kick-back. Therefore, the time extended by the starting signal extension section 407 is desirably set as being a time required for driving the piston, which was stopped before the compression TDC, to a position over the compression TDC right after the stopped position and the compression TDC next thereto.<br>
[0052]<br>
As described above, in the embodiment, the starting signal extension section 407 is provided to drive the starter motor 49 at least as long as for 0.6 seconds even when the starter switch 258 is thrown for a period shorter than 0.6 seconds. Therefore, the kick-back at the starting of the engine is prevented to make it possible to reduce an engine starting noise.<br>
[0053]<br>
Moreover, according to the embodiment, by simply turning an accelerator grip to open the throttle for a short time, the starter motor can be driven for the minimum required length of time for starting the engine. Therefore, particularly in<br><br>
a vehicle to which an automatic centrifugal clutch is employed, the driver can start the engine by easily operating a throttle without giving any attention to an increase in the revolution speed of the engine.<br>
[0054]<br>
Furthermore, according to the above-described starter relay control, in the "starting &amp; idle switch mode", the AND circuit 403 is brought into an enable state. Therefore, when the starter switch 258 is turned on (the output of the AND circuit 402 is brought into the "H" level) by the driver with the revolution speed of the engine being equal to or below the cranking revolution speed and the stop switch 259 being in a turned on state (in braking operation), the starter relay 162 is made conducted to start the starter motor 49.<br>
[0055]<br>
Moreover, in the "stopping and starting mode", the AND circuit 405 is brought into an enable state. Therefore, when the throttle is opened (the output of the AND circuit 404 is brought into the "H" level) with the revolution speed of the engine being equal to or below the idling revolution speed and the seating switch 254 being turned on (the driver is sitting on the seat), the starter relay 162 is made conducted to start the starter motor 49.<br>
[0056]<br>
In the stand-by indicator control section 600 in Fig.<br><br>
10, a detection signal of the vehicle speed sensor 255 is inputted to a vehicle speed zero decision unit 601 which out puts a signal in an "H" level when the vehicle speed is substantially zero. An Ne decision unit 602 obtains an engine revolution speed on the basis of the detection signal of the pulser 153 and outputs a signal in an "H" level when the obtained engine revolution speed is equal to or below a specified value. An AND circuit 603 outputs a logical product of the output signals of the above-described respective decision units 601 and 602.<br>
[0057]<br>
An AND circuit 604 outputs a logical product of the output signal of the above-described AND circuit 603 and an inverted signal of the seating switch 254. An AND circuit 605 outputs a logical product of the output signal of the above-described AND circuit 603 and an output of the seating switch 254. A lighting/flashing control unit 606 generates a lighting signal when the output signal of the AND circuit 604 is in the "H" level, while generates a flashing signal when in an "L" level. An AND circuit 607 outputs a logical product of the output signal of the lighting/flashing control unit 606 and the operation mode signal S301. The stand-by indicator 256 lights up in response to the lighting signal and flashes in response to the flashing signal.<br>
[0058]<br><br>
According to such a stand-by indicator control, as shown in Fig. 12, the stand-by indicator 256, when the vehicle is stopping while being in the "stopping and starting mode", lights up when a driver is not seated, but flashes when the driver is seated. Therefore, the driver, when the stand-by indicator 256 flashes, can recognize that it is possible to immediately start simply by turning the accelerator grip to open the throttle even though the engine is stopped.<br>
[0059]<br>
An ignition control section 700 in Fig. 10 includes an ignition permitting and inhibiting unit 704 that permits or inhibits an ignition operation of the engine by the ignition system 161 under a specified condition in each of the above operation modes.<br>
[0060]<br>
In the ignition permitting and inhibiting unit 704, an ignition starting decision unit 701 permits the ignition operation by the ignition system 161 in response to a specified vehicle starting operation. An ignition stopping decision unit 702 stops the ignition operation by the ignition system 161 in response to a specified vehicle stopping condition.<br>
[0061]<br>
A back-kick avoidance processing unit 703 inhibits the ignition operation by the ignition system 161 only for a specified period in which occurrence of back-kick is predicted.<br><br>
That is, the unit causes misfire of the engine. About the operation of the above-described ignition permitting and inhibiting unit 704, an explanation will be made later with reference to a flowchart. An OR circuit 706 outputs a logical sum of an ignition signal S704 as an output signal of the ignition permitting and inhibiting unit 704 and an inverted signal of the operation mode signal S301.<br>
[0062]<br>
Therefore, in the embodiment, in the "starting &amp; idle SW mode, the output of the OR circuit 7 06 always becomes to be in an "H" level to therefore always permit an ignition operation. Compared with this, in the "stopping and starting mode", an ignition operation is carried out only when the ignition is permitted in the ignition permitting and inhibiting unit 704. Except this, misfire is brought about.<br>
[0063]<br>
Fig. 15 is a flowchart showing an operation of the ignition permitting and inhibiting unit 704. At step S20 an ignition starting control shown in Fig. 16 is carried out in the above-described ignition starting decision unit 701.<br>
[0064]<br>
At step S201 in the ignition starting control in Fig. 16, a decision is made on the basis of an output signal of the throttle switch 257a as to whether the throttle grip is turned to open the throttle or not. When opened, the flow goes to<br><br>
step S203. At step S203, on the basis of an output signal of the seating switch 254, a decision is made as to whether the driver is in being seated or not. When the driver is in being seated, the ignition signal S704 is made on (in the "H" level) at step S204. Namely, the ignition operation of the ignition system 161 is started.<br>
[0065]<br>
Even though it is decided at Step S201 that the throttle grip is not turned to open no throttle, when it is decided at step S202 that a vehicle speed is larger than zero on the basis of a detection signal of the vehicle speed sensor 255, the flow goes to the above-described step S204, where, when it is decided that the driver is seated, the ignition operation of the ignition system 161 is permitted.<br>
[0066]<br>
In this way, according to the ignition starting control in the embodiment, when the driver is seated, either the throttle grip being turned to open the throttle or the vehicle speed increased larger than zero makes the ignition signal S704 on. That is, the ignition operation by the ignition system 161 is permitted.<br>
[0067]<br>
Returning to Fig. 15, at step S21, an ignition stopping control shown in Fig. 17 is executed in the above-described ignition stopping decision unit 702.<br><br>
[0068]<br>
At step S211 in Fig. 17, on the basis of an output signal of the throttle switch 257a, states of the throttle grip are discriminated. Here, when it is decided that the throttle grip closes the throttle, a vehicle speed is decided to be zero on the basis of the detection signal of the vehicle speed sensor 255 at step S212, and it is decided that the driver is in being seated on the basis of an output signal of the seating switch 254 at step S213, starting begins at step S214 unless a timer is started.<br>
[0069]<br>
Thereafter, at step S215, a time-out of the above-described timer (in the embodiment, 3 seconds after) is detected, the outputting of the above-described ignition signal S704 is stopped to inhibit the ignition operation of the ignition system 161.<br>
[0070]<br>
According to the above-described ignition stopping control, with the driver being seated when the throttle is returned to stop the vehicle, the ignition operation by the ignition system 161 is stopped.<br>
[0071]<br>
Returning to Fig. 15, at step S22 and later, a back-kick avoidance processing characteristic to the invention is executed in the back-kich aviodance processing unit 703 in the<br><br>
above-described ignition permitting and inhibiting unit 704. Fig. 18 is a diagram showing a relationship between pulser signals referred to in the back-kick avoidance processing and shapes of reluctors, in which diagram both of an angle between a leading edge Gl of a first reluctor 71 and a leading edge G3 of a second reluctor 72, and an angle between the leading edge G3 and a falling edge G4 of the second reluctor are set<br>
at 45°. In the embodiment, a detection timing of the edge G4 is set as a fixed ignition position.<br>
[0072]<br>
Returning to Fig. 15, at step S22, a decision is made as to whether or not the engine revolution speed Ne is equal to or above 1000 rpm and the throttle switch is made on, that is, whether or not the starting operation is carried out. When the starting operation is detected, the flow returns to step S20 to execute the above ignition starting decision processing.<br>
[0073]<br>
When no starting operation is detected, the engine revolution speed Ne is below 1000 rpm at the time tl in Fig. 19, and this is detected at step S23, a 1 second timer is started at step S24 which timer measures 1 second from the timing as a period during which back-kick is most liable to be caused.<br>
[0074]<br>
At step S25, a decision is made as to whether or not the<br><br>
starting operation is detected and a starting condition of the starter motor 49 is satisfied. When no starting condition is satisfied, a decision is made at step S26 as to whether the timeout of the 1 second timer has occurred or not. When the timeout has not been occurred yet, a decision is further made at step S27 on the basis of the engine revolution speed Ne as to whether the engine is stopped or substantially stopped or not. When the timeout of the 1 second timer has occurred, or the engine is stopped or substantially stopped, the flow returns to step S20 to execute the above-described ignition starting decision processing.<br>
[0075]<br>
Compared with this, when the starting condition of the starter motor 49 is satisfied (in the embodiment, the throttle switch is turned on) at the time t2 before the timeout of the above-described 1 second timer occurs and before the engine is stopped or substantially stopped, and this is detected at step S25, forced misfire control is executed at step S28 which control forces inhibition of ignition for a period of 100 ms from the above-described time t2.<br>
[0076]<br>
At step S29, a decision is made as to whether or not a<br><br>
pulse is detected which is in response to the falling edge G4<br>
of the above-described second reluctor 72.  At the time t3,<br>
when the G4 pulse is first detected after the above-described<br><br>
forced misfire, a first passing time T3 immediately before the detection is compared with 1.3 times a second passing time Ts at step S30. When the first passing time T3 is longer than the 1.3 times the second passing time such that a deceleration is large in the compression stroke, there is a high probability of causing back-kick, so that the flow goes to step S31. At step S31, two times of ignition from that timing are brought to misfire at the times t3 and t4.<br>
[0077]<br>
Thereafter, when reignition of the engine is permitted, ignition of the engine is performed at the time t5 and a decision is made as to whether the engine revolution speed Ne has exceeded 600 rpm or not. As long as the engine revolution speed Ne is below 600 rpm, discrimination is made at step S34 as to whether a specified period has elapsed or not. When the engine revolution speed exceeds 600 rpm at time t6 before the specified period has passed and this is detected at step S32, the flow goes to step S33. At step S33, for making it possible to start the engine quickly, after misfire is inhibited for 2seconds from that timing, the flow returns to step S21.<br>
[0078]<br>
In this way, in the back-kick avoidance processing according to the embodiment, the 90° of the compression stroke is divided into two sections each being of 45° to detect an engine revolution speed in each section. By comparing the<br><br>
detected revolution speeds to discriminate the deceleration of the engine revolution speed. Thus, it becomes possible to exactly decide as to whether the engine revolution speed is reduced down to a low revolution speed region or not immediately before the engine revolution speed is reduced down to the low revolution speed region. This necessitates no unnecessary forced misfire to make it possible to quickly start the engine.<br>
[0079]<br>
Further, according to the embodiment, for a specified period after making the engine misfire, forced misfire is inhibited irrespective of the engine revolution speed. Therefore, even when engine starting is failed to bring the engine revolution speed down to the low revolution speed region again, no forced misfire is carried out, which makes it possible to ignite the engine at the next ignition timing.<br>
[0080]<br>
In the headlight control section 800 in Fig. 11, an Ne decision unit 801 makes a decision on the basis of a detection signal of the pulser 153 as to whether or not the engine revolution is equal to or above a specified set revolution speed (below the idle revolution speed). When the revolution speed is equal to or above the set revolution speed, a signal in an "H" level is outputted. An AND circuit 802 outputs a logical product of the output signal of the Ne decision unit 801 and an inverted signal of the operation mode signal S301. An AND<br><br>
circuit 803 outputs a logical product of the output signal of the Ne decision unit 801 and the operation mode signal S 301.<br>
[0081]<br>
A lighting/dimming switching unit 804, when an output signal of the AND circuit 802 is in an "H" level, outputs a signal in an "H" level, and when in an "L" level, outputs a pulsed signal with a duty ratio of 50 %. A lighting/multistep dimming switching unit 805, when an output signal of the AND circuit 803 is in an "H" level, outputs a signal in an "H" level, and when in an "L" level, counts the duration time thereof with a timer 805a and outputs a pulsed signal with a duty ratio decreasing stepwise in compliance with the duration time. In the embodiment, the duty ratio is reduced stepwise from 95 % down to 50 % in a period from 0.5 to 1 second. By such a stepwise dimming way, an amount of light is reduced instantaneously and linearly to achieve an electric power savings and high marketability keeping.<br>
[0082]<br>
According to such a headlight control, as shown in Pig. 12, in the "starting &amp; idle SW mode", the headlight is lit up or dimmed in compliance with the engine revolution speed Ne. In the "stopping and starting mode", the headlight is lit up or dimmed stepwise in compliance with the engine revolution speed Ne. Therefore, with sufficient visibility being kept, it is possible to suppress battery discharge while the vehicle<br><br>
is stopped. As a result, at a subsequent starting, an amount of charging from the generator to the battery can be reduced to lower electric load of the generator, which improves acceleration performance at the starting.<br>
[0083]<br>
The by-starter control section 900 in Fig. 11, a detection signal of the water temperature sensor 155 is inputted to a water temperature decision unit 901. The water temperature decision unit 901, when a water temperature is equal to or more than a first scheduled value (in the embodiment, 50°C), outputs a signal in an "H" level to close the by-starter relay 164, and when becomes equal to or less than a second<br>
scheduled value (in the embodiment, 10°C), outputs a signal in an "L" level to open the by-starter relay 164.<br>
[0084]<br>
According to such a by-starter control, fuel becomes denser as the water temperature becomes higher, and becomes thinner as the water temperature becomes lower. Moreover, in the embodiment, the opening and closing temperature characteristics of the by-starter relay 164 are set so as to exhibit hysteresis. This can prevent possible unnecessary opening and closing operations of the by-starter relay 164 occurring in the vicinity of the critical temperature.<br>
[0085]<br>
In the charging control section 500 in Fig. 11, a<br><br>
detection signal of the vehicle speed sensor 255 and a detection signal of the throttle sensor 257 are inputted to an acceleration operation detection unit 502, which, when the vehicle speed is larger than 0 and the throttle is opened within 0.3 seconds from completely closed state to the completely opened state as shown in Fig. 12, decides that the operation is an acceleration operation to generate an acceleration detection pulse.<br>
[0086]<br>
A charging at acceleration restriction unit 504 controls the regulator rectifier 167 to reduce a charging voltage for the battery 168 from normal 14.5 V to 12.0 V.<br>
[0087]<br>
The above-described charging at acceleration restricting unit 504 further starts a six-second timer 504a. When timeout of the timer 504a occurs, the engine revolution speed Ne becomes equal to or above a set revolution speed, or the throttle opening is reduced, the charging at acceleration restricting unit 504 releases the charging restriction to reset the charging voltage from 12.0 V to 14.5 V.<br>
[0088]<br>
To a starting operation detection unit 503, the detection signal of the vehicle speed sensor 255, the detection signal of the pulser 153, and the detection signal of the throttle sensor 257 are inputted. As shown in Fig. 12, when the throttle<br><br>
is opened with the vehicle speed being at 0 and the engine revolution speed Ne being equal to or below the set revolution speed (in the embodiment, 2500 rpm), this is decided as a starting operation and a starting detection pulse is generated.<br>
[0089]<br>
A charging at starting restriction unit 505, on detecting the above-described starting detection pulse signal, controls the regulator rectifier 167 to reduce the charging voltage for the battery 168 from normal 14.5 V to 12.0 V.<br>
[0090]<br>
The above-described charging at starting restriction section 505 further starts a seven-second timer 505a. When the timeout of the timer 505a occurs, the engine revolution speed Ne becomes equal to or above a set revolution speed, or the throttle opening is decreased, the charging at starting restricting unit 505 releases the charging restriction to reset the charging voltage from 12.0 V to 14.5 V.<br>
[0091]<br>
According to such a charging control, when a driver abruptly opens for abrupt acceleration, or when starting from a standstill, the charging voltage is suppressed low to temporarily reduce an electrical load of the generator 44. Therefore, a mechanical load on the engine 200 brought about by the generator 44 is reduced to improve acceleration<br><br>
performance.<br>
[0092]<br>
Fig. 3 is a cross sectional view of a second embodiment of the above-described swing unit 17, with the same reference numerals and signs denoting the same or equivalent parts.<br>
[0093]<br>
In the above-described first embodiment, it was explained that the sprocket 58 coupled to the starter motor 49 is to be combined with the outer rotor 42 of the generator 44 through the one-way clutch 50. In the embodiment, however, between the pulley 83, which is on the side opposite to the side of the generator 44 with the crankcase 9 between, and the main bearing 10, the sprocket 58 is combined to the crankshaft 12 through the one-way clutch 50 having a similar function to the above described one.<br>
[0094]<br>
The one-way clutch 50 is constituted of one sleeve 57b fixed to the crankshaft 12, the other sleeve 55b rotatably supported with respect to the crankshaft 12, and a clatch section 56b which combines each of the above-described sleeves 55b and 57b so that the crankshaft 12 is prevented from slippingly rotating in the reverse direction relatively to the sprocket 58, but is permitted to slippingly rotate in the normal direction.<br>
[0095]<br><br>
According to the embodiment, the sprocket 58 for transmitting a driving force of the starter motor 49 to the crankshaft 12 is provided on the side of the pulley 83 of the automatic transmission rather than on the side of the generator 44 with respect to the crankcase 9, and the crank length on the side of the automatic transmission is made longer than that on the side of the generator with the crankcase 9 between. Hence, the central position of the engine as a heavy body can be arranged on the central plane of a tire, that is, on the central plane of the vehicle. Therefore, the swing unit 17 becomes less liable to produce torsion or moment to provide a good weight distribution, which improves a running stability.<br>
[0096]<br>
Furthermore, according to the embodiment, the sprocket 58 coupled to the starter motor 49 is coupled to the crankshaft 12 at a position away from the tire 21 in the axial direction of the crankshaft 12. This makes it possible to enlarge the diameter of the sprocket 58 for obtaining a large reduction ratio. Thus, the starter motor 49 can be made compact and lightweight.<br>
[0097]<br>
Fig. 4 is a cross sectional view of a third embodiment of the above-described swing unit 17, with the same reference numerals and signs as the above denoting the same or equivalent<br><br>
parts.<br>
[0098]<br>
In the embodiment, a sleeve 57c of the above-described one-way clutch 50 on the crankshaft 12 side is integrally formed onto the back face of the fixed pulley piece 83a, i.e. the face without being contacted with the V belt 82, with the other sleeve 55c being fixed to a flange section 83d extended toward outside in the axial direction of the fixed pulley piece 83a. This makes the sprocket 58 so as to be combined at an end of the crankshaft 12 through the one-way clutch 50 and the fixed pulley piece 83a.<br>
[0099]<br>
According to the embodiment, the sprocket 58 and the chain 40 thereof mounted on the outermost portion of the crankshaft 12 facilitate mounting and removal thereof to provide easy maintenance, which further exceedingly facilitates also mounting of an existing swing unit by converting it.<br>
[0100]<br>
Furthermore, also in the embodiment, like in the above-described second embodiment, the sprocket 58 is coupled to the crankshaft 12 at a position away from the tire 21 in the axial direction of the crankshaft 12. This makes it possible to enlarge the diameter of the sprocket 58 for obtaining a large reduction ratio. Thus, the starter motor<br><br>
49 can be made compact and lightweight.<br>
[0101]<br>
Fig. 6 is a cross sectional view of a principal part of a fourth embodiment of the above-described swing unit 17 . Fig. 7 is a cross sectional view of the swing unit 17 on a plane perpendicular to the crankshaft 12. The same reference numerals and signs as the above denote the same or equivalent parts.<br>
[0102]<br>
In the above-described first to third embodiments, for suppressing a starting noise low which noise is generated when starting the engine, the sprocket 58 provided on the crankshaft 12 and the starter motor 49 were coupled with the chain 40. Compared with this, in the fourth embodiment, the sprocket 58 and the starter motor 49 are always coupled with a gear train. Along with this, the crankshaft 12 and the sprocket 58 are coupled through the one-way clutch 50 like in the above so that the power transmission from the side of the crankshaft 12 to the side of the starter motor 49 is cut off without using any sliding pinion gear. This makes it possible to provide one-way coupling from the starter motor 49 to the crankshaft 12 without using any sliding pinion gear. Thus, noise reduction when starting the engine becomes possible.<br>
[0103]<br>
In Figs. 6 and 7, gear teeth 221 are formed on the rotary<br><br>
shaft of the starter motor 49. With the gear teeth 221, there is meshed a large diameter gear 222 coupled to a driving shaft 234. Furthermore, on the driving shaft 234, there is formed a small diameter gear 223 adjacent to the large diameter gear 222 on the same axis. With the small diameter gear 223, there is meshed the sprocket 58 of the crankshaft 12.<br>
[0104]<br>
The above-described driving shaft 234, for preventing increase in noise due to sliding wear and wear looseness in the engine starting system in which frequency of engine starting becomes high, is rotatably supported by a pair of oilless bushing bearings 234a and 234b at both ends thereof with the above-described large diameter gear 222 and the small diameter gear 223 between. Moreover, in the embodiment, for suppressing noise produced from the above-described gear train, gear teeth meshing with each other are subjected to shaving or tooth grinding.<br>
[0105]<br>
Here, in the embodiment, without employing sliding pinion gear for coupling the sprocket 58 provided on the crankshaft 12 and the starter motor 49, both are always coupled by a fixed gear train. This necessitates an additional constitution for one-way coupling which permits power transmission from the starter motor 49 side to the crankshaft 12 side, but cuts off power transmission from the crankshaft<br><br>
12 side to the starter motor 49 side. Therefore, in the embodiment, the above-described sprocket 58 is coupled to the crankshaft 12 through the one-way clutch 50 like in the above.<br>
[0106]<br>
Therefore, at the time of starting the engine, when the starter motor 49 is driven to drive the sprocket 58 in the direction of normal rotation of the crankshaft 12, the crankshaft 12 follows this to be also driven in the direction of the normal rotation. Compared with this, after the engine has been started, even though the starter motor 49 is stopped, the crankshaft 12 slippingly rotates with respect to the sprocket 58. Hence, no driving force of the crankshaft 12 is transmitted to the starter motor 49.<br>
[0107]<br>
As described above, according to the embodiment, the starter motor 49 and the crankshaft 12 can be coupled without using any sliding pinion gear. Thus, it becomes possible to suppress noise, produced when starting the engine, low by an amount of operation noise of the sliding pinion gear which noise is not produced.<br>
[0108]<br>
[Effects of the Invention]<br>
According to the invention, there can be achieved such effects as follows.<br>
[0109]<br><br>
(1)	A compression stroke is divided into a plurality<br>
of sections and an engine revolution speed in each section is<br>
detected. By comparing the detected revolution speeds to<br>
discriminate the deceleration of the engine revolution speed.<br>
Thus, it becomes possible to exactly decide as to whether the<br>
engine revolution speed is reduced down to a low revolution<br>
speed region or not immediately before the engine revolution<br>
speed is reduced down to the low revolution speed region. This<br>
necessitates no unnecessary forced misfire to make it possible<br>
to quickly start the engine.<br>
[0110]<br>
(2)	For a specified period after making the engine<br>
misfire, forced misfire is inhibited irrespective of the<br>
engine revolution speed. Therefore, even when engine starting<br>
is failed to bring the engine revolution speed down to the low<br>
revolution speed region again, no forced misfire is carried<br>
out, which makes it possible to ignite the engine at the next<br>
ignition timing.<br>

Claim:<br>
1. In an engine starting system for a vehicle comprising a starter motor (49) for cranking an engine in response to a specified starting operation, and an ignition system for igniting the engine at a specified rotated angle in response to said starting operation, the engine starting system is characterized by including:<br>
iow revolution speed decisioning means for a decision is made as to whether or not the engine (49) is rotated in the normal direction in the specified low revolution region (STEP23); and<br>
engine revolution speed detecting means for dividing a compression stroke immediately before an ignition timing into a plurality of sections for detecting an engine revolution speed in each of the sections; (STEP 29) and<br>
back-kick avoiding means for inhibiting engine ignition for a specified period irrespective, even if it responds into said starting operation and the starter motor is started (STEP31)<br>
when the starting operation (STEP25) is carried out, the engine is rotated in the normal direction in the said low revolution region and the engine revolution speed in each of said sections is in a specified relation of magnitude with others (STEP30).<br>
2.	The engine starting system for a vehicle as claimed in claim 1, wherein no engine ignition is inhibited for a specified period when the engine revolution speed exceeds a specified revolution speed with a restart of ignition after said engine ignition is inhibited for the specified period.<br>
3.	The engine starting system for a vehicle as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein said ignition system stops an igniting operation of the engine in response to a specified stopping condition while the vehicle is running,<br><br><br>
and  after  the  vehicle  is  stopped,   restarts  the  igniting  operation  in response to a specified starting operation.<br>
4. An engine starting system for a vehicle substantially as herein before described with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
