				<td>The present invention relates to a process of making ultra low expansion glass ceramics.<br>
The glass ceramic material finds use in electronic devices, heat engine components, spark plug or as hot plate tops, domestic cooking ware, high quality telescope mirror blanks and such other applications where zero to a moderate thermal expansion coefficients and higher mechanical strength are required.<br>
The present day method of making glass ceramic material with low thermal expansion coefficient consists of using SiO2, AI2O3, Li2O, TiO2, ZrO2 etc. in their carbonate or oxide form, melting to form glasses, drawing for fabrication of shape, annealing, nucleation and crystallisation, references for which may be made to L. F. OLDFIELD, D. J. HARWOOD, B. LEWIS in Journal of Material Science.1 (1966) 29-40,142-153, THAKUR, R. L and THIAGARAJAN, S in Tenth International Congress on Glass, pp 14.83-14.87 (1974). Tokyo, Ceramic Society of Japan, 1974, V. A. Ulazovski. Belorus. Politekh. Inst. Im. V. I. Stalina, Sbornik Nauch. Trudov 1960, No. 86, 61-4, cf. CA 53, 6561 c. It is also made by using various other raw materials as a source of SiO2, AI2O3, Li2O, TiO2, ZrO2 etc. like blast furnace slag or china clay and different aluminosilicate raw materials references for which may be made to Wafa I .
