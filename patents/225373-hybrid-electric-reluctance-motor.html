PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be performed : -<br><br>
The present report discusses an Invention Patent that describes a hybrid electric motor of the type that can be used in the most varied fields of human activity. In a more general manner, this patent also discusses an electric machine with coils in opposition and permanent magnets in opposition and in parallel with the coils in the stator or rotor.<br>
Electric machines in current prior art are related to the process known as "electromechanical energy conversion", therefore, an electric machine and the link between an electric system, and a mechanical system.<br>
Conversion is reversible in these machines, i.e., if the conversion is from mechanical to electrical the machine is called a generator, on the other hand, if the conversion is from electrical to mechanical the machine is called a motor, reason why this type of machine can be operated as a generator or motor, being called AC machines if the system is Alternating Current, and DC machines if Direct Current (generators or motors).<br>
Within    both    categories Mentioned, there are a variety of motors and generators, including those that use permanent magnets to produce magnetic fluxes.<br>
Permanent magnets are used in the stator and coils in the rotor, or magnets in the rotor and coils in the stator in an electric machine (motor or generator), this being to economize space, since a permanent magnet occupies less space than, an electromagnet having an iron core and copper wire coil.<br>
Magnets are usually employed in motors or generators, segmented for reasons of said space economy. Permanent magnets are also used to raise the efficiency of motors a little, since the permanent magnets have no coil, reducing loss by heat due to 12R corresponding  to  this part of the motor having magnets.<br>
2<br><br>
Generally, a problem found in these motors that count on permanent magnets is that the magnetic field flux created by the magnet is static and permanent, in addition to the fact that this flux cannot be controlled from a minimum value to a maximum value or vice versa, as is the case with electromagnets that produce fully controllable fluxed because they respond to the current and the number of coil windings.<br>
In conventional motors that use permanent magnets, the lower current corresponds to a lower magnetic flux and a higher current corresponds to a higher magnetic flux.<br>
Therefore, and for instance, it is impossible to create a series motor when the stator is made of permanent magnets and the rotor of is made of coil; the same goes for the inverse case.<br>
In many types of series motors (rotor coils in aeries with stator coils), of variable speed that operate with electromagnets only, the amperage is reduced on lowering the voltage, for this reason, the motor speed is proportionally reduced including proportionally the back emf. Inversely, on raising the voltage, the amperage is increased and therefore the speed, including the back emf, is proportionally increased.<br>
In motors with permanent magnets, located in the stator or rotor coils, or vice versa, the back emf is proportional to the permanent magnet flux and is not controllable.<br>
In view of this problem, it is not recommended that permanent, magnets be placed in variable speed motors, since when the current is cut from the motor, the rotor, by inertia, continues to turn due to the magnet's fixed field present, producing back emf, which in most cases is prejudicial.<br>
3<br><br>

magnet;<br>
Figure 12     shows a graph similar to that in figure 11, however in a state with<br>
magnet;<br>
Figure 13  shows a simplified graph of the controller of the motor discussed herein;<br>
Figure 14 shows a diagram of the microcontroller that is part of the controller shown schematically in figure 13; and<br>
Figure 15  shows a diagram of a power board associated with this motor's operation, where a) indicates the "power   supply",   b)   indicates   the   '"power recovery", c) indicates the "from encoder", d) indicates the "harmonic- filter", e) indicates the "motor", f) indicates "from encoder to the microcontroller"   and   g)   indicates   an "optocoupler".<br>
As shown by the figures listed Above, the hybrid electric motor discussed herein is formed by one or more steel plate stators 1, with coils 8 and with their respective steel plate rotors 2, the latter being mounted on a single shaft 3 and aligned, each with its respective stator 1, as shown in figure 1 - section A-A.<br>
The stator 1 and rotors 2 have the same number of salient poles in an even number, as can be seen from figures 1, 2, 3 and 4, representing section A -A, B-B, C-C and D-D.<br>
The coils 8 in this new type of motor, and as can be seen in figures 2, 3 and 4, are positioned in the outer perimeter or crown of stator 1, with the windings in<br>
5<br><br>
"opposition", as can be seen in figure 4, which shows section D-D, where the arrows show the direction of the coil fluxes.<br>
The permanent magnets 9 are located between each pole, as can be seen in figure 2, which shows section B-B, and An parallel with the coils 8, as can be seen in figure 2, which shows the section B-B and also in the case of coils in "opposition", as can be seen in- figure 4, which shows section D-D (direction of the magnets' flux).<br>
When all the coils 8 of the stator are energized at a time sad, since their windings are in "opposition.", the fluxes created by them due to the passing of current are also in "opposition", as can be seen in figure 4, which shows section D-D.<br>
These fluxes produced by coils 8 pass through the path of the poles legs and in direction of the "air qap"; in this path, these magnetic fluxes meet the magnetic fluxes created by the permanent magnets 9 that are in toroid direction, as shown in figure 4, which shows section D-D and in figure 5, which is a representation made by a Finite Element computer program,<br>
Since the fluxes of the Permanent magnets 9 are opposing the fluxes of the coils 8, this due to their having the same polarity as the coil fluxes, they are repelled by them, causing them to leave the toroid in direction of the "air gap", obtaining as a result, in the "air gap", the sum of magnetic fluxes of the coils and magnets, which close their circuits through the rotor poles up to the stator poles, as shown in figure 4, which represents section D-D.<br>
Thus, the magnetic fluxes are obtained with the same current required to produce the coil fluxes alone. This magnetic contribution from the permanent magnets 9 increases the torque of the motor discussed herein. Figures 6 and 7, produced by the Finite Element Program, show a state when the rotor 2 poles are facing the stator 1 poles.<br>
6<br><br>
Still regarding figure 1, we can also see other baSic components of the motor in question, which are: the encoder, indicated in this figure by reference number 4, one of the keys 5, the bearing 6, and the case or body of the motor 7.<br>
Figure 8,., also produced with the same Finite element Program, shows the flux of the magnets and electromagnets when the rotor 2 poles are entering to become aligned with the stator 1 poles, it can be clearly seen in the same figures 6 and 7 that the magnetic density in the pole is the same as that found in the crown or core of the coil 8, differing in that the pole section is double the sum of the sections of the cores of the coils that deliver their fluxes to this pole.<br>
This same magnetic density in the pole, although double in section, is due to the contribution of the flux of the magnets 9 that are in parallel with the coils 8, thus delivering their fluxes to the pole and air gap. This occurs with the same ampere turns that need only the coils as can be seen in the graph of figure 10 (with and without: magnets), produced by the Finite Element Program, where the increase in torque in function of the magnetic flux of the magnets 9 when they are in the above mentioned states can clearly be seen.<br>
When the electric current in the coils 8 of stator 1 is cut, the magnetic fluxes created by them practically drop to zero in their poles. The magnetic fluxes of the magnets 9 in this state enter the toroid in proportion to the reduction in the coils 8 and finally reduction of the fluxes of the coils 8 in function of time, as can be seen in figure 2, which represents section B-B, as well as in figure 9 produced by the Finite Element Computer Program.<br>
Based on the above explanations, the magnetic fields of the magnets 9 are being commuted from the toroid to the pole and from the pole to the toroid, only as a result of the control of magnetic flux of the coils 8 Thus, the magnetic field or flux of the magnets &amp; is being controlled according to the increase or reduction of the coil &amp; current in function of time, as can be seen in the graphs in figures 11 and 12<br>
7<br><br>
of the oscilloscope, only coil - figure 11, and coil with magnet figure 12, produced with half-wave current at 120c/s.<br>
In said graph s and with the cycling marked, one clearly sees the increase in magnetic flux or field when the magnet 9 is added to the system; this Magnetic flux is from the magnet 9 when it is in the Above mentioned states and states in this invention.<br>
It is therefore important to repeat that due to the commutation of the coils 8 as shown in the graphs in figures 11 and 12 of the oscilloscope, the magnetic flux of the magnets 9 are also being commuted from the air gap to the toroid and from the toroid to the air gap, with the advantage that when the coil 8 current is activated, producing a flux proporotional to the current and in function of time, the flux of the magnet 9 leaves the toroid in the same proportion as the flux in the coil 8 and at the same time.<br>
As a result, as previously explained in this report, the flux of the magnet 9 is combined with the flux of the coil 8, both fluxes being conducted together to the air gap. when the current from the coils 8 is deactivated, the magnetic field or flux of the coils 8 reduce until it reaches zero in function of time, and even thus, the magnetic flux or field of the magnets 9 enter the toroid at the same time, reducing its flux in the air gap until it reaches zero, in proportion to the flux reduction in the coil at the same time.<br>
It is important to point out that the same configuration of the permanent magnets 9 in parallel with the coils 8 can be used in the stator I, in the rotor 2, or in the stator and rotor of an electric machine (motor or generator). Therefore, and due to commutation of the flux of the magnet 9 in the Above mentioned states, permanent magnets 9 can be placed in the rotor 2. as well as In the stator 1, something that bad not been done until this invention's proposal.<br>
8<br><br>
In the electric machine called hybrid reluctance motor with staler or stators 1, with coils 8 and, permanent magnets 9 (coils in opposition and permanent magnets in opposition, and in parallel with the coils) , and steel plate rotor or rotors 2, the commutation of the poles is done in the stator or stators 1 by an electronic commuter 10, as shown in figure 13, which has an encoder 11, position sensors for the rotor 12 poles in relation, to the stator poles, current sensors 13 and microprocessor, shown in detail in figure 14, that controls these parameters, as shown in figure 13.<br>
The said figure 13 also shows a) a pulse counter block 14; b) an energy recovery circuit block 15; and c) the block that represents the DC variable source 16.<br>
This electronic commuter is applicable to a similar motor but also having magnet in the rotor instead of steel plates. In relation to the motor with coils and magnets in the stator and also in the rotor, commutation is done by the same electronic commuter, in the rotor as well as in the stator,<br>
When the motor has several stators with their respective rotors (with these rotors assembled in a single axis) commutation is done in all the poles of a stator - rotor to all the poles of the next stator - rotor sequentially as shown in figure 4, which shows section D-D, position of the rotor poles entering the stator pole to become aligned.<br>
Once this motion is completed, the current is annulled in the stator/rotor and commuted to the next stator/rotor and subsequent stators/rotors to obtain the uniform pair, thus the motor is made up of stators with coils and permanent magnets and steel plate rotors, or stators with coils and permanent magnets and rotors with magnets only, or stators with coils and permanent magnets and rotors with coils and permanent magnets.<br>
