STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED FEDERAL RESEARCH<br>
The work of this invention is supported in part by the USDA-NRICGP grants 95-82770,<br>
97-35504 and 98-0185 to Henry Daniell.<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This application pertains to the field of genetic engineering of plant genomes, particularly<br>
plastids and to methods of and engineered plants with operons that lead to and result in<br>
overexpression of the gene of interest. This application also pertains to the field of genetic<br>
engineering of algal and bacterial genomes.<br>
DESCRIPTION. OF RELATED ART<br>
Karamata, in U.S. patent No. 4,797,279, proposed the generation of Bacillus thuringiensis<br>
hybrids that have insecticidal properties through conjugation. Conjugation is mediated by a<br>
conjugative plasmid functional in the B.t. kurstaki strain and the B.t. tenebrionis strain. The resulting<br>
hybrid is capable of producing each of the delta-endotoxin crystals typical for a B.t. kurstaki strain<br>
and a B.t. tenebrionis strain.<br>
McBride, in U.S. patent No. 5,545,818 and McBride et. al. (1995), describes a method of<br>
genetically engineering the plastids of a plant or plant cell such they provide increased expression of<br>
the Bacillus thuringiensis insecticidal proteins in the plastids. A construct containing a promoter<br>
functional in plant plastids, a single gene encoding an insecticidal Bacillus thuringiensis toxin, another<br>
DNA sequence encoding a selectable marker, and a transcription termination region capable of<br>
terminating transcription in a plant plastid, is used to affect plant transformation. The transcription<br>
and translation of the B.t. gene product occurs in the plastids.<br>
Daniell et. al., in U. S. patent 5,932,479 (1999), entitled "Genetic engineering of plant<br>
chloroplast," teaches plant cells chloroplast transformed by means of an expression cassette<br>
comprising an exogenous DNA sequence which is stably integrated to the chloroplast genome of the<br>
cell of a target plant. "Stably" integrated DNA sequences are those which are inherited through<br>
genome replication by daughter cells or organisms. This stablility is exhibited by the ability to<br>
establish permanent cell lines, clones, or transgenic plants comprised of a population containing the<br>
exogenous DNA.<br>
Likewise, U.S. patent 5,693,507 (1997) to Daniell and McFadden discloses such stable<br>
integration of the chloroplast by means of an expression cassette which comprises an exogenous<br>
DNA sequence which codes for a desired trait, and the transformed plant.<br>
Daniell, in PCT International Publication WO 99/10513, teaches the composition and use of<br>
universal chloroplast integration and expression by vectors to stably transform and integrate genes<br>
of interest into chloroplast genome of multiple species of plants. This leads to chloroplast expression<br>
of genes of interest. Transformed plants show the highest level of expression. Plants transformed<br>
with insecticidal genes are lethal to insects that are 40,000-fold resistant to Bt. insecticidal proteins.<br>
Significantly, in the prior art inventions use multiple promoters to drive the expression of<br>
multiple genes. Put differently, the inventions of the prior art employ a single promoter to drive a<br>
single monocistron. In contrast, the present invention employs a single promoter to drive<br>
polycistrons, resulting in equal levels of expression of the polycistrons.<br>
All publications and patents are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In plant and animal cells, nuclear mRNAs are translated monocistronically. This poses a<br>
serious problem when engineering multiple genes in plants. Therefore, in order to express the<br>
polyhydroxybutyrate polymer or Guy"s 13 antibody, single genes were first introduced into individual<br>
transgenic plants, then these plants were back-crossed to reconstitute the entire pathway or the<br>
complete protein. Similarly, in a seven year-long effort, Ye et.al. recently introduced a set of three<br>
genes for a short biosynthetic pathway that resulted in ÃŸ-carotene expression in rice. In contrast,<br>
most chloroplast genes of higher plants are co-transcribed. Multiple steps of chloroplast mRNA<br>
processing are involved in the formation of mature mRNAs.<br>
In accordance of the invention expression of polycistrons via the plastid genome, in particular<br>
the chloroplast genome, provides a unique opportunity to express entire pathways in a single<br>
transformation event. Additionally, chloroplast genetic engineering is an environmentally friendly<br>
approach resulting in containment of foreign genes and hyper-expression.<br>
Plant bioremediation (phytoremediation), is the use of plants for in-situ restoration of<br>
contaminated sites. The technique has risen in the last decade as a strong and safe technique to<br>
address with the increasing problems of the pollution of soil and water bodies. In the past other<br>
techniques, such as mechanical and bacterial bioremediation were implemented with little success,<br>
since they were costly and threatened the safety of our environment. Plants, on the other hand, are<br>
advantageous for bioremediation systems since they have a high capacity for adaptation to different<br>
environments and a natural resistance against different toxic pollutants. They are cheap, non-evasive<br>
and help contain disrupted ecosystems. These characteristics make plants an ideal vehicle for<br>
bioremediation.<br>
Mercury is a toxic heavy metal that is commonly released into the environment as a byproduct<br>
of different chemical reactions of modern industries. The present world production of mercury is<br>
about 9000 tons/year (http://www.chem.ualberta.cal.htm). In the environment, mercury is rapidly<br>
methylated by methanogenic bacteria (Ex. Desulfovibrio desulfuricans) producing the 10 fold more<br>
toxic organomercurials (Compeau et. al.) 1985; Gilmour et. al. 1992). Organomercurials are more<br>
toxic due to its increased hydrophobicity, which allows it to cross lipid membranes because it is more<br>
hydrophobic than mercury. Over 90% of the intake of methylmercury is absorbed into blood<br>
compared with only 2% of inorganic mercury (http://www.chem.ualberta.cal.htm) Both<br>
organomercurials and mercury have the tendency to accumulate in the tissue, especially in the<br>
membrane bound organelles. In plants organic mercury crosses the lipid membrane of organelles, for<br>
example chloroplast, where it can poison essential oxidative and photosynthetic electron transport<br>
chains more easily than metallic mercury (Rugh et. al. 1996). In photosynthetic organisms, mercuury<br>
affects the oxygen-evolving complex that is found in the photosystem II and is bound to the thylakoid<br>
membrane (Bernier et al. 1993). Mercury treatment of PSII leads to a strong inhibition of oxygen<br>
evolution by removal of EP33 (one of the proteins of the OEE complex; Bernier et al. 1995).<br>
Mercury reduces the Fm and Fv values due to additional inhibitory sites on the donor side of PSII,<br>
including damage to the light-photochemistry (Rashid et al. 1990). Medical researchers discovered<br>
that high levels of methylmercury cause severe neurological degeneration in birds, cats and humans<br>
(Minamata Disease Research Group, 1968; Harada et. al. 1995). Thus, mercury and<br>
organomercurials are ideal targets for phytoremediation.<br>
In water, mercury pollution also poses a problem. Mercury accumulates in the sediments of<br>
lakes and oceans where methanogenic bacteria live (http://ehpnet.niehs.nih.gov). These bacteria<br>
methylate mercury to produce methylmercury, which is eventually released into water (Harada et<br>
al. 1995). The methylmercury is trapped into the small fish when the water passes through their gills<br>
or they feed on phytoplanktons that carry high concentrations of the pollutant. Predatory fish, as bass<br>
in fresh water and tuna in salt water, live for long periods of time feeding on smaller fish. During<br>
their life span, they can accumulate high levels of methylmercury that can reach 1.0 ppm in normal<br>
water and 30 ppm in areas of high pollution with mercury (http://ehpnet.niehs.nih.gov) Then, humans<br>
and birds feed on contaminated fish and accumulation in their tissue cause severe neurological<br>
damage.<br>
Meagher and colleagues have used a nuclear modified form of the merA and merB genes to<br>
transform plants that are resistant to mercury and organomercurials respectively (Bizily et al. 1999;<br>
Rugh et. al. 1996), U.S. patent 5,965,796 (1999). One of the drawbacks of nuclear genetic<br>
engineerig is that it requires several back crosses to create the complete pathway that detoxifies<br>
mercury and organomercurials (Bizily et al. 2000). This results in variation in expression levels<br>
among different transgenic lines and tolerance to different concentrations of organomercurials, only<br>
in low levels of tolerance (10 ÂµM) (Bizily et al. 2000). Another concern of the use of nuclear<br>
transformed plants in-situ is the escape of the foreign genes via pollen (Daniell 1999; Bogorad, 2000).<br>
The present invention provides a transgenic plant bioremediation system for soil as well as<br>
a transgenic algae/bacteria bioremediation system for water.<br>
Non-obviousness of expression of operons via the chloroplast genome<br>
Despite the potential advantages of chloroplasts for foreign gene expression, it was not<br>
obvious that multiple genes expressed by a single promoter in chloroplasts would be expressed in this<br>
organelle in a coordinated manner. Polycistrons have been observed in chloroplasts in the past but<br>
processing RNA sequences present in between individual transcripts, proteins or enzymes involved<br>
in processing or cofactors necessary for processing of polycistrons have not yet been characterized.<br>
Therefore, it was not obvious to one skilled in the art that multiple foreign gene transcripts would be<br>
properly processed and translated when expressed from a heterologous promoter.<br>
Prior to this patent application there were no published reports of expression of multiple genes<br>
in chloroplasts and there were valid reasons to suggest that it would be problematic. Indeed, despite<br>
several reports of foreign gene expression via the chloroplast genome, no one ever attempted expression<br>
of a bacterial operon via the chloroplast genome because of inadequate understanding of processing of<br>
polycistrons within plastids. All foreign genes engineered via the plastid genome have been driven by<br>
individual promoters and 3" regulatory sequences. It was not known whether 3" terminators and<br>
regulatory sequences were necessary for individual genes of the foreign operon. It is generally believed<br>
that the proteins or enzymes involved in processing may be under the control of the nuclear genome. It<br>
was also believed that there may be several environmental factors involved in processing polycistrons,<br>
including light.<br>
While chloroplast ribosome binding sites have been characterized, it was not obvious that<br>
ribosome binding sites or untranslated regions upstream of bacterial genes would function in plastids.<br>
Also, it was not anticipated that a chaperonin present in a bacterial cell would function within<br>
chloroplasts and help fold the foreign protein or interfere with folding of other chloroplast proteins. It<br>
was certainly unanticipated that it was possible to create cuboidal crystals within chloroplasts duplicating<br>
the functions of a bacterium during sporulation or duplicate bioremediation pathways within plastids.<br>
There was no certainty that the enzymes of the pathway or proteins of the operon would be expressed<br>
in a coordinated manner.<br>
Indeed, the prior art suggested that there might have been unforeseen deleterious effects of high-<br>
level expression of several foreign proteins within chloroplasts on plant growth or development that were<br>
not apparent from the experiences with other transgenes. The pH and oxidation state of the chloroplast<br>
differs from that of bacterial cells in ways that might inhibit or prevent functions of proteins or enzymes.<br>
Because the results of this invention contradicted those teachings of the prior art, this invention was<br>
characterized as breakthrough in plant biotechnology and featured on the cover of Nature Biotechnology<br>
(the most prestigious biotechnology journal in the world) in January 2000. Scientists around the world<br>
have written reviews subsequent to that publication appreciating this invention. Engineering multiple<br>
genes in transgenic plants via the nuclear genome is not only extremely time consuming (taking several<br>
years to accomplish) but is riddled with problems of position effect, gene silencing etc. Therefore, this<br>
accomplishment was characterized as the holy-grail of plant biotechnology.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
By this invention, plastid expression constructs are provided which are useful for genetic<br>
engineering of plant cells and which provide for enhanced expression of several foreign proteins in<br>
plastids utilizing a single transformation event. The transformed plastid is preferably a metabolically<br>
active plastid, such as the chloroplasts found in green and non-green plant tissues including leaves and<br>
other parts of the plant. This invention opens the door to engineering novel pathways for metabolic<br>
engineering and gene stacking, or for multi subunit complex proteins requiring stoichiometric and<br>
coordinated expression of multiple genes. The plastid is preferably one which is maintained at a high<br>
copy number in the plant tissue of interest.<br>
The present invention is applicable to all plastids of plants. These include chromoplasts which<br>
are present in the fruits, vegetables and flowers; amyloplasts which are present in tubers like the potato;<br>
proplastids in roots; leucoplasts and etioplasts, both of which are present in non-green parts of plants.<br>
The plastid expression constructs for use in this invention generally include a single plastid<br>
promoter region and multiple genes of interest to be expressed in transformed plastids. The DNA<br>
sequence of interest may contain a number of consecutive encoding regions, to be expressed as an<br>
operon, for example where introduction of a foreign biochemical pathway into plastids is desired for<br>
metabolic engineering or gene stacking. Plastid expression constructs of this invention is linked to a<br>
construct having a DNA sequence encoding a selectable marker which can be expressed in a plant plastid.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, transformation vectors for transfer of the construct into a plant cell<br>
include means for inserting the expression and selection constructs into the plastid genome. This<br>
preferably comprises regions of homology to the target plastid genome which flank the constructs.<br>
The chloroplast vector or constructs of the invention preferably include a universal chloroplast<br>
expression vector which is capable of importing a desired trait to a target plant species. Such a vector<br>
is competent for stably transforming the chloroplast genome of different plant species which comprises<br>
an expression cassette which is described further herein. Such a vector generally includes a plastid<br>
promoter region operative in said plant cells chloroplast, a gene which is linked to a multi-gene operon<br>
which includes an ORF which codes for a putative chaperonin which facilitat es the folding of the protein<br>
to form proteolyrically stable cuboidal crystals. Preferably, one or more DNA sequences of interest to<br>
be expressed in the transformed plastids.<br>
The invention provides also a plastid vector comprising of a DNA construct. The DNA construct<br>
includes a 5" part of a plastid DNA sequence inclusive of a spacer sequence; a promoter that is operative<br>
in the plastid; at least a heterologous DNA sequence encoding multiple peptides of interest; a gene that<br>
confers resistance to a selectable marker; a multi-gene operon; a transcription termination region<br>
functional in the target plant cells; and a 3" part of the plastid DNA sequence inclusive of a spacer<br>
sequence. The DNA construct is flanked by DNA sequences which are homologous to the spacer<br>
sequence of the target plastid genome. The plastid is preferably a chloroplast. The vector preferably<br>
includes a ribosome binding site and a 5" untranslated region (5"UTR). A promoter operative in the green<br>
and non-green plastids is to be used in conjunction with the <br>
The invention provides a promoter that is operative in the green and non-green plastids of the<br>
target plant cells such as the psbA promoter, rbcL promoter, atpP promoter region, accD promoter, and<br>
the 16SrRNA promoter..<br>
The invention provides a gene, which can be a mutant gene, that confers resistance, such as<br>
antibiotic resistance, to a selectable marker like the aadA gene.<br>
The invention provides a cassette which can be modified to include a selectable marker, a gene<br>
encoding the chaperonin and any desired heterologous gene. Such applications will be beneficial for the<br>
high level production in plants of other desired protein products as well<br>
Further, the invention preferably provides a three-gene insecticidal Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)<br>
operon which shows operon expression and crystal formation via the chloroplast genome. The operon<br>
comprises of three operably linked components which operate in concert as a biosynthetic pathway: a<br>
distal gene which codes for a insecticidal protein and two open reading frames (ORF). The two ORFs<br>
code for at least one molecule of interest and at least one chaperonin to assist in the folding of the<br>
insecticidal protein. The molecule of interest of this operon can be a peptide, an enzyme, a selectable<br>
marker, or a bio-pharmaceutical, including monoclonals.<br>
This invention also provides for other three-gene operons, particularly insecticidal operon or the<br>
Cry2Aa2 operon. This invention also provides for operons of the Cry or Cyt series.<br>
An operon of this invention further provides that the second ORF (ORF2) codes for a putative<br>
chaperonin. A chaperonin is a molecule which facilitates the folding and assembly of proteins to form<br>
functional proteolytically stable cuboidal crystals. The ORF2 is operably linked to a gene encoding the<br>
insecticidal protein. The invention provides a bacterial chaperonin that is capable of facilitating the<br>
folding and assembly of insecticidal proteins.<br>
This invention also provides crystalized insecticidal proteins such as 8-endotoxin proteins, Cry<br>
proteins such as the Cry2Aa2 proteins, or Cyt proteins.<br>
In accordance of the invention, the introduction blocks of foreign genes in a single operon would<br>
avoid complications inherent in nuclear transformation such as position effect and gene silencing in<br>
putting one gene at a time into random locations in the nuclear genome. Repeated use of a single<br>
promoter causes gene silencing (De Wilte, C. et. al. 2000). Cloning several genes into a single T-DNA<br>
does not avoid the compounded variable expression problem encountered in nuclear transgenic plants.<br>
This invention shows that a bacterial operon can be expressed in a single integration event. Expression<br>
of multiple genes via a single transformation event opens the possibility of expressing foreign pathways<br>
or pharmaceutical proteins involving multiple genes.<br>
The invention provides for the demonstration of expression of abacterial operon or polycistrons<br>
in transgenic plants and opens the door to engineer novel pathways in plants in a single transformation<br>
event.<br>
The invention provides a single vector or construct (or cassette) which encodes more than one<br>
heterologous protein product. This embodiment of the invention provides that a heterologous DNA<br>
fragment that is introduced into a universal vector encodes more than one gene. In one example shown,<br>
this invention discloses, the DNA encodes an operon of three genes and produces proteins from at least<br>
two genes, one of those genes encode a protein and a chaperone protein. This aspect of the invention<br>
-to co-expressing multiple genes - is beneficial if one skilled in the art desires to introduce a biosynthetic<br>
pathway that comprises multiple steps into plants. For example, a three step synthesis of a desired<br>
compound might require three different enzymes. A single transformation will generate a recombinant<br>
plant possessing all three heterologous enzymes which can function in concert to produce the desired<br>
product.<br>
Thus another embodiment of the invention relates to the maximal production of a heterologous<br>
protein by co-expressing it with another polypeptide that induces crystallization of said protein. This<br>
aspect of the invention provides the yield of heterologous gene expression is greatly enhanced if the<br>
desired protein is in crystal form in the transformed plant. The increased yield is because the crystal form<br>
of the proteins protected them from cellular proteases. This is accomplished by co-expressing the desired<br>
gene with a second gene encoding a chaperonin that directs crystallization.<br>
Also, formation of crystals of foreign proteins opens a simple method of purification via<br>
centrifugation. Plants transformed with the cry2Aa2 operon of the invention show a large accumulation<br>
and improved persistence of the expressed insecticidal protein(s) throughout the life of the plant. This<br>
is most likely because of the folding of the insecticidal protein into cuboidal crystals, thereby protecting<br>
it from proteases. This is an environmentally friendly approach because folded crystals improve the<br>
safety of the Bt transgenic plants. In contrast to currently marketed transgenic plants that contain soluble<br>
CRY proteins, folded protoxin crystals will be processed only by those target insects that have high<br>
alkaline gut environment. In addition, absence of insecticidal protein in transgenic pollen eliminates<br>
toxicity to non-target insects via pollen. Expression of the cry2Aa2 operon in chloroplasts provides a<br>
model system for hyper-expression of foreign proteins in a folded configuration enhancing their stability<br>
and facilitating single step purification. This is the first successful demonstration of expression of a<br>
bacterial operon in transgenic chloroplast plants.<br>
The invention provides a model system for large-scale production of foreign protein within<br>
chloroplasts in the folded configuration enhancing their stability and facilitating single-step purification,<br>
for example, biopharmaceuticals such as human serum albumin (HSA) and insulin.<br>
All known methods of transformation can be used to introduce the vectors of this invention<br>
into target plant plastids including bombardment, PEG Treatment, Agrobacterium, microinjection,<br>
etc.<br>
The invention provides transformed crops, like solanaceous plants (monocotyledonous and<br>
dicotyledonous). Preferably, the plants are edible for mammals, including humans.<br>
The invention provides target Bt transgenic plants which are likely to show a more stable protein<br>
expressed at high levels in the chloroplast throughout the growing season. It should increase toxicity of<br>
Bt transgenic plants to target insects and help eliminate the development of Bt resistance. The invention<br>
provides an example of the cry2Aa2 bacterial operon is expressed in tobacco chloroplasts to test the<br>
resultant transgenic plants for increased expression and improved persistence of the accumulated<br>
insecticidal protein(s).<br>
The invention provides transformed plants including leaves which accumulated a high percent of<br>
total soluble protein (close to 50%) in mature leaves and remain stable even in old bleached leaves.<br>
The invention provides transformed plants which are resistant to difficult-to-control insects, like<br>
cotton boll worm, which were killed 100% after consuming transgenic leaves. The invention also<br>
provides plants which contain insecticidal protein fold into cuboidal crystals. Plants which contain<br>
protoxin crystals, which will be processed only by target insects that have high alkaline gut environment,<br>
which should improve safety of Bt transgenic plants. Also, plants are free of insecticidal proteins in<br>
transgenic pollen, which eliminates toxicity to non-target insects via pollen such as Monarch butterfly<br>
larvae. The invention provides electron microscopic proof of the presence of the cuboidal crystals inside<br>
the chloroplast.<br>
The invention also provides an environment friendly approach to engineering insect resistance<br>
to plants because folded crystal products improve the safety of the Bt transgenic plants which will be<br>
edible consume, mammals, including humans.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention provides heterologous DNA sequences which mediate<br>
resistance to (a) heavy metal in transgenic plants or plant cells which express these coding sequences<br>
encoding metal ion reductasesand (b) organomercurial compounds in transgenic plants or plant cells<br>
which express the coding sequence encoding organomercury lyase. Preferably the coding sequence is that<br>
of merA (which encodes mercuric ion reductase) and merB (which encodes organomercury lyase).<br>
The present invention provides a chloroplast universal vector which contains a Mer operon<br>
containing metal resistance coding sequences operably linked to transcriptional and translational control<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is related to transformation of the plastid genome applicable to all plastids of<br>
plants. These include chromoplasts which are present in the fruits, vegetables and flowers;<br>
amyloplasts which are present in tubers like the potato; proplastids in roots; leucoplasts and<br>
etioplasts, both of which are present in non-green parts of plants<br>
The invention provides in one aspect a single vector or construct which encodes more than one<br>
heterologous protein product. The second aspect of the invention relates to the; maximal production of<br>
a heterologous protein by co-expressing it with another polypeptide or a chaperone that induces<br>
crystallization of said protein.<br>
The first aspect of the invention provides that a heterologous DNA fragment that is introduced<br>
into a plastid vector (described below) encodes more than one gene. In one example, the DNA encodes<br>
an operon of three genes and produces proteins from three genes. This aspect of the invention to co-<br>
expressing multiple genes is beneficial if one desires to introduce a biosynthetic pathway into plants that<br>
comprises multiple steps. For example, a three step synthesis of a desired compound might require three<br>
different enzymes. Co-expressing all three enzymes in the chloroplast can be accomplished according<br>
to this invention. Thus, a single transformation will generate a recombinant plant possessing all three<br>
heterologous enzymes which can function in concert to produce the desired product.<br>
The second aspect of the invention is that the yield of heterologous gene expression is greatly<br>
enhanced if the desired protein is in crystal form in the transformed plant, as provided by this invention.<br>
This is accomplished by co-expressing the desired gene with a second gene encoding a chaperone protein<br>
that directs crystallization. Data given in the specification shows almost 100 fold greater amounts of<br>
insecticidal protein can be found in plants co-expressing the chaperone protein versus plants having only<br>
the gene encoding the insecticidal protein. The expression cassette itself can be modified to include a<br>
selectable marker, a gene encoding the chaperone protein and any desired heterologous gene. Such<br>
applications will be beneficial for the high level production in plants of other desired protein products as<br>
well.<br>
A further aspect of the invention describes a plant bioremediation system. A plant bioremediation<br>
system employing chloroplast transformants have a number of advantages. First, plants have the genetic<br>
capacity (using hundreds, even thousands, of genes) to extract at least 16 metal cation and oxyanion<br>
nutrients from the soil and ground water. This capacity can be chemically and genetically manipulated<br>
to extract environmental pollutants. Second, plants have extensive root systems to help in this mining<br>
effort; typical estimates are as high as l00xl06 miles of roots per acre [Dittmer, H. J. (1937) Amer. J.<br>
Botany 24-.417-420]. The root systems of various macrophytes can reach up to 40 feet into the soil, hi<br>
addition, plants are photosynthetic and govern as much as 80% of the available energy at any given time<br>
in most ecosystems. Through photosystem I (a system not found in photosynthetic bacteria), they use<br>
light energy to generate large amounts of reducing power (as NADPH) that can be used to efficiently<br>
reduce metal ions. Plants photosynthetically fix CO2 and reduce it to make their own carbon/energy<br>
source. This reduced carbon energy is used by plant roots to live heterotrophically. This redox power<br>
can also be used to reduce toxic metal ions like Hg(II) [Rugh et al. (1996) supra]. Many plants can<br>
produce large amounts of biomass annually with the potential both to enrich contaminated soil with<br>
carbon and nutrients and/or remove metal ions from the soil. The site of action of mercury within the<br>
chloroplasts, ability to express bacterial operon via the chloroplast genome, and several other<br>
environmental benefits of chloroplast genetic engineering make this an advantageous system for metal<br>
remediation.<br>
An additional benefit of the metal resistant plants is their ability to harvest metals; precious and<br>
semi-precious metals can be reduced and thereby trapped in plant tissues. These metals include can<br>
include gold, silver, platinum, rhenium, copper, palladium, nickel, zinc and cadmium, where the<br>
corresponding metal ions are reduced by the metal resistance gene product in those plants.<br>
In addition, this invention also introduces a novel approach for mercury and organomercurial<br>
bioremediation in water. Two organisms are used as model systems. One is Synechocystis, a<br>
photosynthetic bacterium (Cyanobacterium) that grows in salt and fresh water (in a high temperature<br>
range, from ice to hot springs). The other is Chlorella vulgaris, a green algae that grows in fresh water.<br>
These organisms are transformed with the merA and merB genes (mer operon) to remove mercury and<br>
organomercurials from water. Transformed cells could be applied for sludge treatment and in water<br>
treatment to remove organomercury and mercury form water and sediments before releasing them to the<br>
environment, especially from industrial effluents that generate byproducts with mercury.<br>
"Metal resistance" means that a non-naturally occurring organism is not inhibited by the presence<br>
of at least one of divalent cations of mercury, cadmium, cobalt, trivalent cations of gold, and monovalent<br>
silver ion, at concentrations (levels) at which a naturally occurring (wild-type) counterpart of the non-<br>
naturally occurring organism is inhibited or exhibits symptoms of toxicity. It is not intended that the term<br>
metal resistance refer to resistance to unlimited concentration of metal ions, but rather the term is relative<br>
in that it relies on comparison to the properties of a parental strain.<br>
A "metal resistance coding sequence" is one which encodes a protein capable of mediating<br>
resistance to at least one metal ion, including, but not limited to, divalent cations of mercury, nickel,<br>
cobalt, trivalent cations of gold, and by monovalent cations of silver. Also within the scope of this<br>
definition are mutant sequences which determine proteins capable of mediating resistance to divalent<br>
cations of lead, cadmium and copper.<br>
An "organomercurial resistance coding sequence" is one whose protein product mediates<br>
resistance to such organic mercury compounds as alkylmercurials and certain aromatic mercurials, for<br>
example, mono- or dimethylmercury, typically in conjunction with a metal resistance gene such as merA.<br>
As specifically exemplified herein, the organomercurial resistance gene is the methylmercury lyase gene<br>
(merB) and its gene product confers resistance to organomercurial compounds such as methymercury,<br>
p-chloromercuribenzoate (PCMB) and p-hydroxymercuribenzoate in conjunction with the merA gene<br>
product (mercury ion reductase).<br>
The metal resistance protein (MerA protein, mercuric ion reductase) is exemplified by that from<br>
Tn21, a bacterial mercury resistance transposon originally isolated from the IncFII plasmid NR1. In<br>
addition to reducing mercuric ions, the Tn21 MerA reduces trivalent gold and monovalent silver cations<br>
[Summers and Sugarman (1974) Journal of Bacteriology 119:242-249]. Monovalent silver and certain<br>
divalent metal cations have been shown to be competitive inhibitors of mercuric ion reduction in vitro<br>
[Rinderle et al. (1983) Biochemistry 22:869-876]. MerA mediates resistance to trivalent gold, divalent<br>
cobalt, divalent copper and divalent nickel cations as well as divalent ionic mercury.<br>
It is understood that nucleic acid sequences from nucleotide 14 through nucleotide 1708, or<br>
MerApe 20, MerApe 29, MerApe 38 or MerApe 47 will function as coding sequences synonymous with<br>
the exemplified merApe9 coding sequence. Nucleic acid sequences are synonymous if the amino acid<br>
sequences encoded by those nucleic acid sequences are the same. The degeneracy of the genetic code<br>
is well known to the art; i.e., for many amino acids, there is more than one nucleotide triplet which serves<br>
as the codon for the amino acid; for expression in plant cells or tissue it is desired that codon usage<br>
reflect that of plant genes and that CpG dinucleotides be kept low in frequency in the coding sequence.<br>
It is also well known in the biological arts that certain amino acid substitutions can be made in protein<br>
sequences without affecting the function of the protein. Generally, conservative amino acid substitutions<br>
or substitutions of similar amino acids are tolerated without affecting protein function. Similar amino<br>
acids can be those that are similar in size and/or charge properties, for example, aspartate and glutamate<br>
and isoleucine and valine are both pairs of similar amino acids. Similarity between amino acid pairs has<br>
been assessed in the art in a number of ways. For example, Dayhoff et al. (1978) in Atlas of Protein<br>
Sequence and Structure, Vol. 5, Suppl. 3, pp. 345-352, which is incorporated by reference herein,<br>
provides frequency tables for amino acid substitutions which can be employed as a measure of amino acid<br>
similarity. Dayhoff et al."s frequency tables are based on comparisons of amino acid sequences for<br>
proteins having the same function from a variety of evolutionarily different sources.<br>
The expression of merB in plants confers resistance to and/or the ability to detoxify<br>
organomercurials including, but not limited to, alkylmercury compounds wherein the alkyl group is either<br>
straight chain or branched, alkenyl mercury compounds, allyl mercury, alkynyl mercury compounds,<br>
aromatic mercury compounds, wherein there are from one to about 6 aromatic rings, and other<br>
organomercurials including but not limited to humic acid-containing mercury compounds. The MerB<br>
protein also mediates resistance to and/or detoxifies organo-metals including, but not limited to, organic<br>
lead, organic cadmium and organic arsenic compounds, where those organometals can be alkyl, aklenyl,<br>
alkynyl or aromatic metal compounds.<br>
Coding sequences suitable for expression in a plant are operably linked downstream of a<br>
constitutive or a regulated promoter construct. Transgenic plants can be constructed by use of<br>
chloroplast universal vector containing a 5" a part of a chloroplast spacer sequence, a promoter that is<br>
operative in the chloroplast of the target plant cells, at least two heterologous DNA sequences encoding<br>
merA and merB, a gene that confers resistance to a selectable marker; a transcription termination region<br>
functional in the target plant cells; and a 3" part of the chloroplast spacer sequence. Alternatively, the<br>
vector may not contain a terminator.<br>
The mer operon-expressing plants can be used in the remediation of mercury-contaminated soil<br>
to block the biomagnification of methyl mercury up the food chain. Deep-rooted trees like cottonwood<br>
and sweetgum, which inhabit bottom lands, can be transfomred to express mer A and merB. These<br>
species have roots that grow in the same general area of the sediment as sulfate-reducing bacteria. As<br>
the transgenic plant roots take up methyl mercury, MerB breaks the carbon mercury bond to produce<br>
Hg(II). Hg(II) is a highly reactive metal ion and should end up sequestered in plant tissues bound to<br>
various thiol groups.<br>
Hg(II) produced from the MerB reaction and additional Hg(II) taken up from the environment<br>
through its normal mining of nutrients is reduced to Hg(0) by the MerA reaction. Hg(0) is released<br>
directly from the roots or transpired up the vascular system of the plant, as are waste gasses like CO2<br>
from some plants [Dacey, J.W. (1980) Science 210:1017-1019; Dacey, J.W. (1981) Ecology 62:1137;<br>
Raven et al. (1986) In: Biology of Plants, Worth Publishers, N.Y., p.775]. By lowering the total levels<br>
in the soil, less methyl mercury will be produced by sulfate-reducing bacteria. Using the MerA and MerB<br>
together in transgenic plants at contaminated sites lowers total Hg(II) levels and destroys environmental<br>
methyl mercury, thus preventing a large portion of the methyl mercury from moving through the<br>
environment.<br>
The Hg(0) entering the environment joins the enormous and stable pool of Hg(0) in the<br>
atmosphere (Nriagu (1979) In: The Biogeochemistry of Mercury in the Environment, (New York:<br>
Elsevier) with half life of over one year. Because Hg(0) is not easily returned to earth, this pool is not<br>
thought to contribute less significantly to manmade contamination of the environment. In contrast,<br>
atmospheric Hg(II) species (i.e., mercury released from coal burning or methyl mercury released<br>
naturally) are rapidly returned to earth by rain and dry deposition with a half-life of about 1-2 weeks.<br>
Thus, volatilization of relatively small amounts of Hg(0) with good air circulation effectively removes<br>
mercury from terrestrial and aquatic environments.<br>
Once a transgenic plant population expressing MerA and MerB is established, these plants<br>
efficiently process mercury. Over the subsequent few decades these plants remove or detoxify most<br>
mercury from at a site. Relying only on currently available biological and chemical processing, the efflux<br>
rates of Hg(0) from mercury contaminated sites are extremely slow. At one such government site it is<br>
estimated that only 10 kg of the 80,000 kg present in the soil is released as Hg(0) per year (Lindberg et<br>
al. (1995) Environ. Sci. Tech. 29,126-135). The levels of atmospheric mercury at this and most sites (4-<br>
10 ug/m.sup.3) are 10,000 fold below what the EPA/OSHA recommend as the maximimum allowable<br>
levels (U.S. Public Health Service (1994) Toxicological Profile for Mercury. In: Regulations and<br>
Advisories, U.S. Public Health Service, Washington, D.C., pp. 261 -269). Even if transgenic plants at this<br>
site increased the efflux rate of metallic mercury 200 times, the level of atmospheric mercury would still<br>
be 50 fold below these allowable levels. The transgenic plants of the present invention allow the efficient<br>
removal of toxic metal compounds such as methyl mercury and ionic mercury from soil, sediment, and<br>
aquatic environments, thus meeting a longfelt need for efficient bioremediation of metal and organometal<br>
contaminated sites.<br>
The Operons of the Vector<br>
The cry2Aa2 Operon. The preferred embodiment of the invention is the use of Bacillus thuringiensis<br>
(Bt) cry2Aa2 operon as a model system to demonstrate operon expression and crystal formation via the<br>
chloroplast genome of tobacco. This operon contains three open reading frames (ORFs). Cry2Aa2 is<br>
the distal gene of this operon. The ORF immediately upstream of cry2Aa2 codes for a putative<br>
chaperonin that facilitates the folding of cry2Aa2 (and other selected target proteins) to form<br>
proteolytically stable cuboidal crystals. Because CRY protein levels decrease in plant tissues late in the<br>
growing season or under physiological stress, a more stable protein expressed at high levels in the<br>
chloroplast throughout the growing season should increase toxicity of Bt transgenic plants to target<br>
insects and help eliminate the development of Bt resistance. The function of the third ORF is not yet<br>
known. The invention comprises the operon with the third gene and also with the operon without the<br>
third gene.<br>
The mer Operon. Another embodiment of the invention uses the mer Operon. The genes for mercury<br>
resistance are known as Mer genes, they are found in operons of bacterial pasmids; different genes<br>
constitute operons, but the two most important are: the merA that codes for the mercuric ion reductase<br>
and the merB that codes for the organomercurial lyases (Foster, 1983; Summers et al. 1978, 1986). Mer<br>
A is a 1.7kb gene that needs NADPH as a co-factor to reduce mercury to a volatile, non-reactive and<br>
less toxic form of mercury (HgO) (Begley et al. 1986). Mer B is a 638bp gene that undergoes the<br>
protonolysis of organomercurials by removing the organic group and releasing elemental mercury, which<br>
is detoxified by merA (Jackson et al. 1982). A polycistron containing both genes allows effective<br>
degradation of mercury and organomercurials<br>
Alternative Operons<br>
Other Cry or Cyt operons may be used in this invention. Any operon which comprises at least<br>
one of the 133 genes shown in the article MMBR, September 1998, pages 805-873, Vol 62, No. 4,<br>
Revision of the Nomenclature for the BT Insecticidal Crystal Proteins by Crickmon et al., the genes of<br>
which codes for the corresponding BT protein; and the chaperonin which facilitates protein folding can<br>
be used. Likewise, any operon which comprises at least one of the toxins enumerated in Table 15.1 or<br>
at least one of the of Molecular Biotechnology by Glick and Pasternak can be used. Similarly, any<br>
operon which comprises a gene which codes for a delta-endotoxin and the chaperonin which facilitates<br>
protein folding can be used. In addition, any operon which comprises at least a plasmid identified in<br>
Table 13.1 of the of Molecular Biotechnology by Glick and Pasternak can be used.<br>
The Chaperonins<br>
Chaperonins are a class of a protein referred to as chaperones which has been shown to consist<br>
of helper proteins in chain folding and assembly with the cells (Gierasch and King, 1990). They<br>
facilitate the folding and assembly of newly synthesized polypeptide chains into functional three-<br>
dimensional structures by preventing off-pathway reactions during folding that lead to aggregation<br>
(Agashe VR et. al. 2000). Chaperonins provide a sequestered environment in which folding can proceed<br>
unimpaired by intermolecular interactions between non-native polypeptides (Agashe VR et. al. 2000).<br>
Those skilled in the art will be familiar with the E. Coli chaperonins: groEL and groES (Viitanen PV et.<br>
al. 1995), (Gierasch and King, 1990). Plant chaperonins chaperonin-60 and chaperonin-10, which are<br>
homologous of gro-EL and gro-ES, respectively. Homologous of the E. Coli groEL and groES continue<br>
to be identified. For instance, a stable complex of the chaperonins has been isolated and crystallized from<br>
the extremely thermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus (Lissin NM et. al. 1992). Likewise, plant<br>
chaperonins - located both in plastids and the cytosol, continue to be identified (Baneyx F. et. al., 1995;<br>
Viitanen PV et. al., 1995; Burt WJ et. al. 1994, Grellet F. et. al. 1993; Bertsch U et. al., 1992). These<br>
articles are hereby incorporated in their entirety by reference.<br>
The preferred embodiment of this invention use of those bacterial chaperonins that are capable<br>
of facilitating the crystallization of the Bt endotoxin polypeptides by means of the UV Ct vector and in<br>
the transformed plants.<br>
The Vectors<br>
This invention contemplates the use of vectors which are capable of stably transforming the<br>
chloroplast genome. Such vectors include chloroplast expression vectors such as pUC,<br>
pBlueScript, pGEM, and all others identified by Daniell in US patents number 5,693,507 and<br>
5,932,479. These publications and patents are herein incorporated by reference to the same extent as<br>
if each individual publication or patent was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated<br>
by reference.<br>
Universal Vector. A preferred embodiment of this invention utilizes a universal integration and<br>
expression vector competent for stably transforming the chloroplast genome of different plant species<br>
(Universal Vector). The universal vector and its construction have been described by the earlier<br>
Publication No. WO99/10513, International publication date: 4 March 1990, which is herein incorporated<br>
in its entirety.<br>
The 4.0 kb cry2Aa2 operon was inserted into the universal chloroplast expression vector pLD<br>
CtV2 (5.8 kb) to form the final E. coli and tobacco shuttle vector pLD-BD Cry2Aa2 operon (9.8 kb)<br>
(Fig. 1 A). This vector could be used to transform chloroplast genomes of several plant species because<br>
the flanking sequences are highly conserved among higher plants. This vector contains the 16S rRNA<br>
promoter (Prrn) driving the aadA gene (aminoglycoside 3"- adenylyltransferase) for spectinomycin<br>
selection and the three genes of the cry2Aa2 operon. The terminator is the psbA 3" region from the<br>
tobacco chloroplast genome from a gene coding for the photosystem II reaction center component. The<br>
16S rRNA promoter is one of the strong chloroplast promoters recognized by both nuclear and plastid<br>
encoded RNA polymerases in tobacco and the psbA 3" region stabilizes the transcript of foreign genes.<br>
This construct integrates both genes into the spacer region between the chloroplast transfer RNA genes<br>
coding for isoleucine and alanine within the inverted repeat (IR) region of the chloroplast genome by<br>
homologous recombination. The integration into these transcribed spacer regions allow the gene to be<br>
inserted without interfering with gene coding regions. Also, each genome will contain two gene copies<br>
due to integration into the two inverted repeat regions resulting in a higher copy number (7,000-8,000<br>
copies per cell) and higher levels of expression. However, the two genes may also be integrated outside<br>
of the IR region resulting in a lower copy number. Chloroplast transgenic plants were obtained as<br>
described previously by Daniell (1993, 1997).<br>
Mer operon vectors with and without terminator: In order to understand the role of 3"UTRs<br>
in chloroplast foreign gene expression (in mRNA stability and transcription termination), chloroplast<br>
vectors with and without 3" UTRs were made. The PCR products, merA and merB were cloned<br>
independently into the pCR2.1 vector (In Vitrogen). Then, the orientation of the merB gene integration<br>
was checked. Once the correct orientation was found, the vector TA-merB was cut with a Clal/EcoRV.<br>
MerA was cut with Clal and EcoRV, and the fragment (merA) was isolated by gel electrophoresis.<br>
Then, the merB and merA genes were ligated. After the ligation, both genes (merB and merA) in-frame<br>
were ready for insertion into the pLD vector. After cutting pLD vector with PstI to linearize the vector<br>
and to remove the terminator, the merB-merA cassette extracted from the TA-vector was ligated into<br>
the pLD vector (Fig. 8). The final step was to check for correct orientation. Thus the pLD-rnerAB<br>
vector lacking 3" UTR was constructed.<br>
To make the pLD-merA.B-3"UTR, specific set of primers were used to amplify the whole cassette<br>
from the TA-merAB vector. The 5" primer was designed with an EcoRV site and the 3" primer with a<br>
Xbal site. These restriction sites allowed the integration into the pLD vector only in the right orientation.<br>
Chloroplast integration of foreign genes<br>
Foreign gene integration into the chloroplast genome was determined by PCR screening of<br>
chloroplast transformants (Fig. 1 A,B,C). Primers were designed to eliminate spectinomycin mutants and<br>
nuclear integration. The first primer set, 1P1M, lands one primer (1P) on the 3" end of the 16s rRNA<br>
flanking sequence and another primer (1M) on aadA (Fig. 1A). This is to distinguish between<br>
spectinomycin mutants and true spectinomycin transformants. A 1.6 kb fragment is seen in true<br>
transformants (Fig. 1B, lanes 3,5,6,7). Lane 4 shows a spectinomycin mutant with no PCR product.<br>
Untransformed tobacco DNA (lane 2) expectedly shows no product, while pLD-BD cry2Aa2 operon<br>
plasmid DNA in lane 8 produced the 1.6 kb fragment. The second primer set, 3P3M, lands one primer<br>
(3P) on the native chloroplast genome adjacent to the point of integration, and another primer (3M) on<br>
the aadA gene (Fig. 1 A). This primer set generated a 1.65 kb PCR product in chloroplast transformants<br>
(Fig. 1C, lanes 3,5,6,7). Untransformed tobacco DNA (lane 2) showed no PCR product, and pLD-BD<br>
cry2Aa2 operon plasmid DNA in lane 8 also showed no PCR product because 3P lands on native<br>
chloroplast DNA. Lane 4 was negative for chloroplast integration and again proving this transformant<br>
to be a spectinomycin mutant.<br>
Southern blot analysis was done to further demonstrate site-specific chloroplast integration of the<br>
4.0 kb cry2Aa2 operon and to determine heteroplasmy or homoplasmy (Fig. 2). Bglll digested DNA<br>
from transformed plants produce 8.42 kb and 1.4 kb fragments (Fig. 2B) when probed with the 0.81 kb<br>
probe (Fig. 2A) that hybridizes to the trn\ and trnA flanking sequences. Transgenic plant DNA (T0 and<br>
T1) produced the 8.42 kb and 1.4 kb fragments (Fig. 2C, lanes 3-9). A 4.47 kb fragment (Fig. 2A) is<br>
seen in untransformed plant DNA (Fig. 2C lane 2). T0 plant DNA also shows this native untransformed<br>
4.47 kb fragment (Fig. 2C, lanes 3-7), thereby showing heteroplasmy in the T0 generation. This 4.47 kb<br>
native band is absent from the T1 generation (Fig. 2C, lanes 8-9), thus indicating homoplasmy. If only<br>
a fraction of the genomes were transformed, the gene copy number should be less than 8,000 per cell.<br>
Confirmation of homoplasmy in T1 transgenic lines indicates that the Cry2Aa2 operon gene copy number<br>
could be as many as 7000-8,000 per cell.<br>
CRY2Aa2 protein expression and quantification: Expression profile of the operon derived (OD)<br>
Cry2Aa2 and single gene derived (SG) Cry2Aa21 is shown on a Coomassie stained SDS-PAGE gel (Fig.<br>
3). The primary goal of this experiment is to investigate the location of the operon derived Cry2Aa2<br>
protein (the pellet or supernatant) and correlate with cuboidal crystals observed in electron micrographs<br>
(see Figure 6). Lane 2 contains partially purified 65 KD Cry2Aa2 from E. coli. Because crystalline<br>
Cry2Aa2 inclusion bodies are solubilized at high alkaline pH, the 50mM NaOH solubilized pellet was<br>
analyzed from each plant sample after centrifugation for 20 min at 13,000g (lanes 3,5,7). Results show<br>
that OD Cry2Aa2 expression forms crystalline inclusion bodies because the protein is found mostly in<br>
the pellet after centrifugation (lanes 5-6). In contrast, expression of SG Cry2Aa2 is observed in both the<br>
pellet and the supernatant (lanes 3-4). No Cry2Aa2 expression was seen in untransformed tobacco in<br>
either the supernatant or the pellet (lanes 7, 8).<br>
Cry 2Aa2 polypeptides (Fig. 3, lanes 3,5) were scanned using Storm 840 Gel Scanner and Image<br>
Quant Software (Molecular Dynamics). The operon-derived expression results only in a 2.5 fold more<br>
accumulation of Cry2Aa2 than that of single gene derived cry2Aa2 in the pellet fraction; this does not<br>
correlate with more than 100 fold difference observed in ELISA (Figure 4). The reason for this<br>
discrepancy is the extreme difference in solubilization between SG Cry2Aa2 derived amorphous inclusion<br>
bodies and the OD Cry2Aa2 derived cuboidal crystals, as reported previously.<br>
Despite the large difference in protein accumulation (as shown by ELISA and electron micrographs, Figs.<br>
4,6), the concentration of solubilized protein loaded in the pellet fraction was similar in SG Cry2Aa2 and<br>
OD Cry2Aa2 (Figure 3, lanes 3,5). Attempts to completely solubilize crystalline inclusion bodies for<br>
SDS PAGE analysis were not successful because higher pH interfered with gel electrophoresis and<br>
repeated dilution decreased protein concentration below detectable levels in Coornassie stained gels.<br>
However, for quantification using ELISA it was possible to completely solubilize crystalline<br>
inclusion bodies under optimal conditions and dilute the protein to fit within the linear range of the<br>
Cry2aA2 standard. Therefore, protein expression levels of SG Cry2Aa2 and OD Cry2Aa2 were<br>
quantified using ELISA (Fig. 4). Additionally, CRY protein accumulation in young, mature, and old<br>
transgenic leaves derived from a single gene or operon was compared to investigate their stability over<br>
time. Young, mature, and old leaves expressed SG Cry2Aa2 at 0.014%, 0.36%, and 0.03% respectively<br>
(Fig. 4A). Cry2Aa2 levels peaked in the mature leaf (0.36%) and drastically declined to 0.03% as the<br>
plant senesced. However, young, mature, and old leaves containing OD Cry2Aa2 accumulated at 34.9%,<br>
45.3%, and 46.1 % respectively (Fig. 413). As these transgenic plants aged, OD Cry2Aa2 concentrations<br>
remained stable and did not decline like the SG Cry2Aa2. The presence of the operon-expressed putative<br>
chaperonin should enable the toxin to be folded into stable crystalline structures that are protected from<br>
degradation. Based on quantitative expression, the cry2Aa2 operon derived expression levels are<br>
comparable to that of the RuBisCo, the most abundant protein on earth that compromises up to 65% of<br>
leaf soluble protein.<br>
Insect Bioassays: Five-day-old tobacco budworm (Heliothis virescens), ten day old cotton bollworm<br>
(Helicoverpa zed) and beet armyworm (Spodoptera exigua) larvae consumed the entire leaf after 24 hrs<br>
on the untransformed control (Figs. 5A, D, G). H. virescens feeding on SG Cry2Aa2 leaves died after<br>
5 days (Fig. 5B) while insects died after 3 days on OD Cry2Aa2 leaves (Fig. 5C). For SG Cry2Aa2, H.<br>
zea consumed considerable leaf material after 24 hr, stopped feeding after three days and died after five<br>
days (Fig.5E). H. zea consumed very little OD Cry2Aa2 material after 24 hours, stopped feeding, and<br>
died after five days (Fig. 5F). S. exigua feeding on SG Cry2Aa2 (Fig. 5H) or OD Cry2Aa2 (Fig. 51)<br>
were lethargic after 24 hours and died after 48 hours. Milkweed leaves dusted with OD Cry2A2<br>
transgenic pollen were not toxic to Monarch butterfly larvae (data not shown) confirming earlier<br>
observations that foreign proteins are not present in tobacco pollen.<br>
Electron Microscopic Analysis: Untransformed and transgenic leaf sections were immunogold-labeled<br>
with a Cry2A polyclonal antibody (Fig. 6). Figures A-C show developmental OD Cry2Aa2 in<br>
chloroplasts in young, mature, and old leaves, respectively. In a young green OD Cry2Aa2 transgenic<br>
leaf (Fig. 6A), labeled Cry2Aa2 occupies a significant amount of the chloroplast, but no crystalline<br>
structures are observed. In a mature green OD Cry2Aa2 transgenic leaf (Fig. 6B), labeled Cry2Aa2<br>
occupies a larger amount of the chloroplast than the younger leaf, resulting in crystals. Theses cuboidal<br>
crystals are essentially identical to those expressed in wild-type Cry2Aa2 crystals, or recombinantly in<br>
Bt or E coli. In an old bleached OD Cry2Aa2 transgenic leaf (Fig. 6C), labeled Cry2Aa2 maintains the<br>
crystalline structure and occupies the highest volume of the chloroplast observed, despite being bleached<br>
and senescent. These findings correlate with OD Cry2Aa2 ELISA results. In young developing leaves,<br>
OD Cry2Aa2 begins accumulation (34.9%), folds Cry2Aa2 into a cuboidal configuration in mature leaves<br>
occupying more cell volume (45.3%), and maintains this cuboidal structure and volume in old leaves<br>
(46.1 %). Essentially, as the transgenic OD Cry2Aa2 plant ages, OD Cry2Aa2 is accumulated, folded<br>
and maintained.<br>
Figure 6D is a mature green OD Cry2Aa2 transgenic leaf showing crystal formation with no<br>
immunogold label. This probably occurs because as the Cry2Aa2 is folded by the putative chaperonin,<br>
epitopes are concealed thereby decreasing labeling. Crystal formation in Fig. 6D would cause the OD<br>
Cry2Aa2 to pellet after centrifugation as seen in SDS-PAGE Fig. 3 (lane 5). In EM analysis of mature<br>
leaves expressing SG Cry2Aa2 (Fig. 6E), protein aggregation is observed, although no crystalline folding<br>
is seen. Cry2Aa2 immunogold labeling occurs in an area of much lower density than is seen in OD<br>
Cry2Aa2 transgenic plants suggesting lower expression. These results also correlate with ELISA (0.3 6%<br>
in SG Cry2Aa2 in mature leaves). There is no localized antibody observed in untransformed tobacco<br>
(Fig. 6F).<br>
Transgenic phenotypes: Phenotypes of OD Cry2Aa2 transgenic plants are not morphologically different<br>
from SG Cry2Aa2 transgenic plants (Fig. 7). Therefore, higher levels of expression and accumulation<br>
of CRY proteins did not visibly impact their phenotype. Both transgenic plants flowered and set seeds.<br>
Characterization of OD Cry2Aa2 T1 transgenic plants for stable integration and transmission of foreign<br>
genes has been shown earlier (Fig. 2).<br>
Possibility of Gene Pyramiding<br>
This invention enables expression of polycistrons in the chloroplast genome. In contrast to prior<br>
efforts in engineering gene expression in transgenic plants, the present invention allows for this<br>
achievement in a single transformation event that is environmentally safe. The invention thus opens the<br>
possibility for gene pyramiding: the insertion of multiple insecticidal genes. The invention contemplates<br>
operons which include not only Bacillus thuingiensis (B.t.) insecticidal toxin genes, but also non-B.t.<br>
insecticidal toxin genes such as cholesteral oxidase, alpha-amylase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, the<br>
cowpea trypsin inhibitors, and the potato proteinase inhibitor II. Inclusion of multiple heterologous<br>
insecticidal toxin genes retards the ability of insects to develop resistance to bio-pesticides.<br>
Expression of Biological Pathways<br>
Further, this invention provides a method of engineering biological pathways into the chloroplast<br>
genome in a single transformation event that is environmentally safe. Because gene expression is<br>
controlled by one promoter, DNA sequences encoding the different genes necessary in a pathway can<br>
be co-expressed to the same levels. Once expressed, the genes of the pathway can act in concert. Gene<br>
expression can result in synthesis of enzymes that confer desired traits such as degradation of metal ions,<br>
herbicides, pesticides, solvents, toulene, napthalene, and other xenobiotics. An example is the chloroplast<br>
transformation of plant chloroplasts with the Mer operon leading to the biodegradation of mercury and<br>
organomercurials. Other pathways include the pigment biosynthesis pathway, biosynthetic pathways for<br>
enzymes that are could confer desired traits such as degradation of xenobiotic compounds noted above,<br>
pathways for amino acids such as the lysine biosynthetic pathway, and pathways for the synthesis of<br>
vitamins, carbohydrates, fatty acids, biopolymers and polyesters. Further examples are provided in<br>
chapters 12 and 13 of Molecular Biotechnology by Glick and Pasternak, which is herein incorporated<br>
by reference. Other xenobiotics which can be degraded using the system of this invention include those<br>
given in U.S. patent 4,259,444 to Chakrabarty which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
Expression of pathways can result in the production of compounds such as ammo acids, fatty<br>
acids, carbohydrates, polymers, vitamins, antibiotics and dyes.<br>
Efficient Expression of Bio-pharmaceuticals<br>
The ability to express polycistrons also opens up the possibility of efficiently expressing bio-<br>
pharmaceuticals such as monoclonal antibodies. Those skilled in the art will know the four DNA<br>
sequences encoding proteins necessary to compose the molecule. Those skilled in the art will also know<br>
that these proteins should be produced in equal amounts (the same stoichiometric ratio). The PCT<br>
application entitled "Production of Antibodies in Transgenic Plastids," filed on 2/28.2001 by Daniell, is<br>
hereby incorporated by reference to offer examples of such proteins. This invention allows for the<br>
coordinated expression of these sequences because they are driven by the same promoter. This method<br>
avoids the problems of the prior art; namely the pitfalls of nuclear transformation such as the positional<br>
effect and gene silencing.<br>
Application to Other Plants.<br>
This invention provides any higher plants, such as monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plant<br>
species. The plants that may be transformed via the universal vector with an antibiotic selectable marker<br>
may be solanacious plants or plants that grow underground. Most importantly, this invention is<br>
applicable to the major economically important crops such as maize, rice, soybean, wheat, and cotton.<br>
A non-exclusive list of examples of higher plants which may be so transformed include cereals such as<br>
barley, corn, oat, rice, and wheat; melons such as cucumber, muskmelon, and watermelon; legumes such<br>
as bean, cowpea, pea, peanut; oil crops such as canola and soybean; solanaceous plants such as tobacco;<br>
tuber crops such as potato and sweet potato; and vegetables like tomato, pepper and radish; fruits such<br>
as pear, grape, peach, plum, banana, apple and strawberry; fiber crops like the Gossypium genus such<br>
as cotton, flax and hemp; and other plants such as beet, cotton, coffee, radish, commercial flowing plants,<br>
such as carnation and roses; grasses, such as sugar cane or turfgrass; evergreen trees such as fir, spruce,<br>
and pine, and deciduous trees, such as maple and oak.<br>
The invention now being generally described, it will be more readily understood by reference to<br>
the following examples which are included for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit<br>
the present invention.<br>

The invention is exemplified in the following non-limiting examples which are only for illustrative<br>
purposes and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention..<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Bombardment and selection of transgenic plants: Tobacco plants were grown aseptically under<br>
fluorescent lights in the laboratory. Seeds were germinated on MSO medium at 27Â°C with photoperiods<br>
of 16 hour light and 8 hour dark. Microcarriers coated with pLD-BD Cry2Aa2 operon DNA was used<br>
to bombard sterile leaves using the Bio-Rad PDS-1000/He biolistic device as described by Darnell (1997).<br>
Bombarded leaves were subjected to two rounds of selection on RMOP medium containing 500 Âµg/ml<br>
of spectinomycin to regenerate transformants.<br>
PCR Analysis: DNA was extracted from leaves using the Q1AGEN DNeasy Plant Mini Kit. PCR was<br>
done using the Perkin Elmer Gene Amp PCR System 2400. All PCR reactions were performed using<br>
the Qiagen Taq DNA Polymerase Kit. Primer sequences used were: IP (5"-<br>
ACAATGTAGCCGTACTGGA AGGTGCG GGTG-3"), 1M (5"-CGCGCTT AGC<br>
TGGATAACGCCACGGAA-3"), 3P(5"-AAAA CCCGTCCTCA GTTCGGATTGC-3"), and 3M (5"-<br>
CCGCGTTGTTTCATCAA GCCTTACG-3"). Samples were run for 30 cycles with the following<br>
sequence: 94Â°C for 1 minute, 70Â°C for 1.5 minutes, and 72Â°C for 3 minutes. PCR products were<br>
separated on 0.8% agarose gels.<br>
Southern Blot Analysis: DNA from transformed and untransformed plants was digested with BgIII and<br>
transferred to a nylon membrane by capillary action. The 0.81 kb probe was generated by digesting pLD-<br>
CtV2 vector DNA with BamHl/BgIII and labeled with 32P using the ProbeQuantâ„¢ G-50 Micro<br>
Columns (Amersham). Labeled probe was hybridized with the nylon membrane using the Stratagene<br>
QUICK-HYB hybridization solution and protocol.<br>
SDS-PAGE Analysis: Transgenic and untransformed leaf material (600 mg) was ground to a powder<br>
in liquid nitrogen. Protein extraction buffer from the Cry2Aa2 plate kit from Envirologix (Portland,<br>
Maine) used for quantification was added to the powder and further grinding was performed. The<br>
mixture was centrifuged at 4Â°C at 13,000g for 20 minutes. The supernatant was removed, boiled in<br>
sample buffer, and loaded on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. The pellet was resuspended in 50mM NaOH and<br>
centrifuged at 4Â°C at 5000g for 5 minutes to pellet cell debris. The supernatant was removed, boiled in<br>
sample buffer, and loaded on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel at 200V for 4 hours. Gels were stained for 2 hours<br>
with R-250 Coomassie Blue and destained overnight in 40% methanol and 10% acetic acid. The DC<br>
protein assay by Bio-Rad was used to determine total soluble and pellet protein concentration as followed<br>
by protocol.<br>
ELISA: A Cry2Aa2 plate kit from Envirologix was used. Leaves expressing the SG Cry2Aa2, the OD<br>
Cry2Aa2, and untransformed tobacco were quantified and compared. Approximately 20 mg of leaf was<br>
ground in 100 Âµl of 50mM NaOH to solubilize CRY proteins. Transgenic leaf extracts were diluted to<br>
fit in the linear range of the provided Cry2aA2 standard. The Âµ Quant microtiter plate reader from Bio-<br>
Tek read the plate at 450 nanometers (nm). A 1ppm Cry2Aa2 standard was supplied by the kit and was<br>
used in the linear range between 200-1000 ng for quantification. Color development is proportional to<br>
Cry2Aa2 concentration in the sample extract. The DC protein assay by Bio-Rad was used to determine<br>
total soluble protein concentration as followed by protocol.<br>
Insect Bioassays: Leaf disc bioassays were conducted on ca. 2 cm2 excised leaf material, and placed on<br>
distilled water-soaked cardboard lids in 50 x 12 mm plastic petri dishes. Insects used were susceptible<br>
H. virescens (YDK) obtained from Fred Gould, North Carolina State University, H. zea obtained from<br>
the USDA AIRS facility in Tifton, GA and S. exigua from the lab of William Moar. Insects were tested<br>
as five day or ten day old. All larvae were reared on typical lepidopteran artificial diet prior to use. Two<br>
insects were assayed per leaf sample, except H. zea in which only 1 insect was added per leaf sample due<br>
to the cannibalistic nature of the insect (2 leaf samples for H. zea). All leaf samples for each replicate<br>
were from the same leaf. Two samples were evaluated per treatment, and observed daily for mortality<br>
and leaf damage for 5 days. Treatments were replicated three times.<br>
Transmission Electron Microscopy and Immunogold Labeling: Immunogold labeled electron<br>
microscopy was performed as described by A. J. Vrekleij et. al.. Sections were first incubated with 0.05M<br>
glycine in PBS buffer (l0mM phosphate buffer, 150mM NaCl pH 7.4) for 15 minutes to inactivate<br>
residual aldehyde groups. The grids were then blocked by placing them onto drops of PBS with 5% BS A<br>
and 0.1 % CWFS gelatin supplemented with 5% normal serum for 30 minutes, washed on drops of<br>
incubation buffer 3 times for 5 min each, and then incubated for 45 min with the polyclonal Cry2Aa2 to<br>
detect tobacco expression (diluted 1:10,000 in incubation buffer). To remove unbound primary antibody,<br>
sections were washed on drops of incubation buffer 6X5 min each. Sections were then incubated for<br>
2 hours with a goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody conjugate to 10nm gold diluted 1:100 in<br>
incubation buffer. Sections were subsequently washed 6X5 minutes in incubation buffer, 3X5 min<br>
with PBS, and post-fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde diluted in PBS for 5 min. Following post-fixation,<br>
sections were washed in PBS 3X5 minutes, in distilled water 5X2 min each, and post-stained using<br>
uranylacetate and lead citrate. Sections were then examined in a Zeiss EM 10 transmission electron<br>
microscope at 60kv.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
E. Coli Transformants. Due to the similarity of protein synthetic machinery (Brixey et al. 1997),<br>
expression of all metal resistance conferring chloroplast vectors are first tested in E.coli before their use<br>
in tobacco transformation. The activity of the enzymes, mercury ion reductase (merA) and<br>
organornercurial lyase (merB) are tested by transforming E. coli (XLI-blue) with the recombinant<br>
plasmids and growing them in LB solid medium with HgCl2 (Fig. 9). The cells, control (XLI-bue), pLD-<br>
merAB and pLDmerAB-3"UTR are grown in different concentrations of Hg Cl2. Control cells do not<br>
grow even at concentrations less than 25 ÂµM HgCl2 but the transformed cells grow well even at 100 ÂµM<br>
HgCl2-(Fig. 10). The ability to grow at these high concentrations of mercury in which control is not able<br>
to grow, confirms the functionality of both enzymes. Control and transformed clones are grown in LB<br>
with 500Âµg/rnl of spectinomycin for 24 hours at 37" C. When OD600 is measured, 1.247 for the clone with<br>
3" UTR, 0.165 for the clone lacking the 3" UTR, and zero absorbance for the control is observed. As<br>
expected the pLD-merAB-3"UTR transformed clone shows a higher growth rate probably caused by the<br>
3" effective termination which allows cells to make more copies of the mer operon transcript that contain<br>
only the aadA, merA and merB genes. In chloroplast genome we expect a minor effect in the<br>
transcription termination efficiency because the terminator of the genes close to the cassette and<br>
downstream can serve as a terminator, once it is integrated in the chloroplast genome by homologous<br>
recombination.<br>
Bombardment and regeneration of chloroplast transgenic plants: Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum var.<br>
Petit Havana) plants are grown aseptically by germination of seeds on MSO medium (Daniell 1993).<br>
Fully expanded, dark green leaves of about two month old plants are bombarded as described by Daniell<br>
(1997). The plants are maintained under 500Âµg/ml spectinomycin selection in the three phases; first<br>
selection (RMOP medium), second round of selection (RMOP medium) and third selection MSO<br>
(rooting medium) (Fig. 10). After these selection events, positive transformants are transferred to soil<br>
(Fig 10). The plants are tested for integration of the genes in the chloroplast at first round of selection<br>
and before transplanting them to soil. The use of PCR with specific primers that land in the chloroplast<br>
genome and in the gene cassette allows us to eliminate mutants and show integration of the selectable<br>
marker gene and the mer genes (Fig. 11). After PCR testing, the plants are grown in soil and the seeds<br>
are collected.<br>
Polymerase Chain Reaction: PCR is done using DNA isolated from control and transgenic plants to<br>
distinguish a) true chloroplast transfomants from mutants and b) chloroplast transformants from nuclear<br>
transformants. Primers for testing the presence of the aadA (a gene that confers spectinomycin<br>
resistance) in transgenic plants are landed on the aadA coding sequence and 16S rRNA gene<br>
(primers 1IP&amp;1M). In order to test chloroplast integration of the mer genes, one primer is landed on the<br>
aadA gene while another is landed on the native chloroplast genome (primers 3P&amp;3M). No PCR product<br>
is obtained with nuclear transgenic plants using this set of primers. The primer set (5P &amp; 2M) is used<br>
to test integration of the entire gene cassette without any internal deletion or looping out during<br>
homologous recombination, by landing on the respective recombination sites. This screening is essential<br>
to eliminate mutants and nuclear transformants. In order to conduct PCR analyses in transgenic plants,<br>
total DNA from unbombarded and transgenic plants are isolated as described by Edwards et al. (1991).<br>
Chloroplast transgenic plants containing the mer gene are moved to second round of selection in order<br>
to achieve homoplasmy.<br>
Southern Blot Analysis: Southern blots are done to determine the copy number of the introduced<br>
foreign gene per cell as well as to test homoplasmy. There are several thousand copies of the chloroplast<br>
genome present in each plant cell. Therefore, when foreign genes are inserted into the chloroplast<br>
genome, it is possible that some of the chloroplast genomes have foreign genes integrated while others<br>
remain as the wild type (heteroplasmy). Therefore, in order to ensure that only the transformed genome<br>
exists in cells of transgenic plants (homoplasmy), the selection process is continued. In order to confirm<br>
that the wild type genome does not exist at the end of the selection cycle, total DNA from transgenic<br>
plants is probed with the chloroplast border (flanking) sequences (the trnl-trnA fragment). If wild type<br>
genomes are present (heteroplasmy), the native fragment size will be observed along with transformed<br>
genomes. Presence of a large fragment (due to insertion of foreign genes within the flanking sequences)<br>
and absence of the native small fragment should confirm homoplasmy (Daniell et al.,1998; Kota et al.,<br>
1999; Guda et al., 2000).<br>
The copy number of the integrated gene is determined by establishing homoplasmy for the transgenic<br>
chloroplast genome. Tobacco Chloroplasts contain 5000-10,000 copies of their genoine per cell (Daniell<br>
et al. 1998). If only a fraction of the genomes are actually transformed, the copy number, by default,<br>
must be less than 10,000. By establishing that in the transgenics, the merAB inserted transformed<br>
genome is the only one present, one could establish that the copy number is 5000-10,000 per cell. This<br>
is done by digesting the total DNA with a suitable restriction enzyme and probing with the flanking<br>
sequences that enable homologous recombination into the chloroplast genome. The native fragment<br>
present in the control should be absent in the transgenics. The absence of native fragment proves that<br>
only the transgenic chloroplast genome is present in the cell and there is no native, untransformed,<br>
chloroplast genome, without the mer genes present. This establishes the homoplasmic nature of our<br>
transformants, simultaneously providing us with an estimate of 5000-10,000 copies of the foreign genes<br>
per cell.<br>
Northern Blot Analysis: Northern blots are done to test the efficiency of transcription of the merAB<br>
operon. Total RNA is isolated from 150 mg of frozen leaves by using the "Rneasy Plant Total RNA<br>
Isolation Kit" (QiagenInc.,Chatsworth,CA). RNA(10-40 Âµg) is denatured by formaldehyde treatment,<br>
separated on a 1.2% agarose gel in the presence of formaldehyde and transferred to a nitrocellulose<br>
membrane (MSI) as described in Sambrook et al. (1989). Probe DNA (merAB gene coding region) is<br>
labeled by the random-primed method (Promega) with 32P-dCTP isotope. The blot is pre-hybridized,<br>
hybridized and washed as described above for southern blot analysis. Transcript levels are quantified by<br>
the Molecular Analyst Program using the GS-700 Imaging Densitometer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).<br>
Plant Bloassays<br>
Germination/Growth Experiments: Seeds of wild-type (Nicotiana tabacum var Petit Havana),<br>
transgenic plant pLD-MerAB, and transgenic plant pLD-MerAB-3"UTR are sterilized, vernalized at 4"<br>
C for at least 24h, and germinated on 1% Phytoagar plates (GIBCO/BRL) made with Murashige and<br>
Skoog (4.3g/liter, GIBCO/BRL) medium containing PMA (phenylmercuric acetate) or mercuric chloride.<br>
Seedlings are grown at 22Â° C with a 16 h light/8 h dark period.<br>
Mercury Vapor Assays: Elemental mercury is relatively insoluble and volatile and lost quickly from cells<br>
and media. Volatilized HgÂ° is measured on a Jerome 431 mercury vapor analyzer (Arizona Instrument,<br>
Phoeniz, AZ) (Rugh, C.L. et al., 1996). Approximately 5-10 seedlings (10-14 day old, 10-25 mg total<br>
wet weight) are incubated in 2ml of assay medium (50mm Tris.HCL, pH 6.8/50mM NaCl/25uM HgCl2)<br>
in a l6xl30 mm test tube with a side arm for gas removal. The Hg Cl2 is added to initiate the assay.<br>
The amount of HgÂ° produced is assayed by bubbling air through the bottom of the sample for 12 sec at<br>
3cm3/sec and measuring the release of HgÂ°. The time zero assay will be taken immediately after the<br>
seedlings are placed in the medium. The sample is then reassayed every minute for 10 minutes. The<br>
volatilized HgÂ° is measured by passing the air sample released from the side arm directly over the gold<br>
foil membrane resistor of a Jerome 431 mercury vapor analyzer. The instrument is repeatedly<br>
standardized with known quantities of HgÂ° (10-200 ng), reduced from HgCl2 with excess SnCl2. The<br>
amount of mercury evolved is normalized by dividing the number of nanograms of HgÂ° measured by the<br>
number of milligrams of seedling tissue in the assay.<br>
Photosynthetic studies: From transgenic plants and untransformed plants, intact chloroplasts are<br>
isolated for photosynthetic studies. O2 evolution is studied in an oxygen evolution electrode in the<br>
absence or presence of different concentrations of HgCl2 and PMA. Electron transport is studied with<br>
suitable electron donors/acceptors to study photosystem I, II or both. PAGE is used to examine the<br>
composition of PSII complex, especially EP33, after incubation of cells or chloroplasts or thylakoid<br>
membranes with different concentrations of HgC 12 and PMA. In vivo chloroplast fluorescence is studied<br>
to monitor changes in control and transformed cells or chloroplasts to measure Fo, Fm, Fv.<br>
Inheritance of Introduced Foreign Genes: While it is unlikely that introduced DNA would move from<br>
the chloroplast genome to nuclear genome, it is possible that the gene could get integrated in the nuclear<br>
genome during bombardment and remain undetected in Southern analysis. Therefore, in initial tobacco<br>
transformants, some are allowed to self-pollinate, whereas others are used in reciprocal crosses with<br>
control tobacco (transgenics as female accepters and pollen donors; testing for maternal inheritance).<br>
Harvested seeds (Tl) are germinated on media containing spectinomycin. Achievement of homoplasmy<br>
and mode of inheritance is classified by looking at germination results. Homoplasmy is indicated by<br>
totally green seedlings (Daniell et al., 1998) while heteroplasmy is displayed by variegated leaves (lack<br>
of pigmentation, Svab &amp; - Maliga, 1993). Lack of variation in chlorophyll pigmentation among progeny<br>
also underscores the absence of position effect, an artifact of nuclear transformation. Maternal<br>
inheritance is demonstrated by sole transmission of introduced genes via seed generated on transgenic<br>
plants, regardless of pollen source (green seedlings on selective media). When transgenic pollen is used<br>
for pollination of control plants, resultant progeny would not contain resistance to chemical in selective<br>
media (will appear bleached; Svab and Maliga, 1993). Molecular analyses confirms transmission and<br>
expression of introduced genes, and T2 seed are generated from those confirmed plants by the analyses<br>
described above.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Chlorella vulgaris transformation vector: The region 16S to 23S of the Chlorella vulgaris chloroplast<br>
genome is amplified by PCR using specific primers complementary to rrnl6 and to rrn23. The PCR<br>
product will be cloned into pCR 2.1 vector available from Promega. The PCR product 16S to 23S is<br>
removed from the pCR2.1 vector by a blunt end restriction endonuclease and cloned into the pUC 19 in<br>
which the multiple cloning site has been removed using a blunt end restriction enzyme (Pvull). Then the<br>
cassette containing the promoter, the antibiotic resistance gene and the merAB genes is inserted into the<br>
new vector (Chlorella transformation vector) using a blunt end restriction enzyme (HincII) that is present<br>
in the spacer region between trnA and trnT. The final construct is used for the transformation of<br>
Chlorella vulgaris (Fig. 12).<br>
Bombardment and transformation of Chlorella vulgaris: The biolistic transformation method<br>
(Sanford et al. 1993) is optimized for transformation of Chlorella vulgaris. Chlorella is grown in liquid<br>
heterotrophic medium (5 sporulation agar) at 25Â° C to late-log phase (~6 x 106 cells/ml). To prepare a<br>
monolayer for bombardment (2x107), cells are collected onto prewetted 45mm GVWP filters (Millipore)<br>
under gentle (30 mBar) vacuum. Gold particles are coated with the transforming plasmid. (Sanford et<br>
al. 1993) The monolayer filters are bombarded. Immediately after bombardment, filters are transferred<br>
to selective solid media containing 500Âµg/ml spectinomycin and incubated at 22Â° C under high light.<br>
After approximately 6 weeks, green colonies are picked from a background of bleached cells onto<br>
selective plates and grown for an additional 1-2 weeks. Colonies are harvested and screened for<br>
integration of foreign genes when they reached a diameter of approximately 5mm.<br>
Chlorella vulgaris Bioassays: Growth and colonies formation bioassay are performed as explained in<br>
the plant germination growth experiment; the only change is the use of Chlorella specific media.<br>
Mercury vapor assays: Mercury vapor assays are performed in the way explained for plants above<br>
except changing the growth media specific to Chlorella, including temperature and light intensity.<br>
Photosynthetic studies: Photosynthetic studies are performed in the way explained for plants above<br>
except untransformed and transformed Chlorella cells will be directly used to study the effect of mercury<br>
toxicity.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Synechocystis transformation vector: The region 16S to 23 S of the Synechocystis genome is amplified<br>
by PCR using specific primers complementary to rrn 116 and to rrn23. The PCR product is cloned into<br>
the pCR 2.1 vector available from Promega. The PCR product 16S to 23S is removed from the pCR2.1<br>
vector by a blunt end restriction endonuclease and cloned into pUC 19 in which the multiple cloning site<br>
has been removed using a blunt end restriction enzyme (Pvull). Then the cassette containing the<br>
promoter, the antibiotic resistance gene and the merAB genes is inserted into the new vector<br>
(Synechocystis transformation vector) using a blunt end restriction enzyme (Hindi) that is present in the<br>
spacer region between trnI and trnA. The final construct will be used for the transformation of<br>
Synechocystis (Fig. 13).<br>
Transformation of Synechocystis: A fresh culture of wild type in BG-11 (heterotrophic medium) plus<br>
glucose is grown to OD730 = 0.5 after 2-3 days of culture. Cells are spun down in sterile 50 ml tubes at<br>
room temperature and resuspended in the original growth medium to OD730= 2.5. Transforming DNA<br>
is added to resuspended cells in sterile glass culture tubes. Tubes are placed in rack in the growth<br>
chamber at 30Â° C for 6 hours and shaken for 3 hours. Cells (200 Âµl) are plated on a sterile filter that has<br>
been placed on a BG- 11 plus glucose plate and spread around. After growth for 24 hours and they are<br>
transferred to filters on appropriate medium containing spectinomycin or mercuric chloride.<br>
Synechocystis Bioassays: Growth and colonies formation bioassay are performed as explained in the<br>
plant germination-growth experiment; the only change is the use Synechocystis growth media.<br>
Mercury vapor assays: Mercury vapor assays are performed in the way explained for plants above<br>
except changing the growth media specific to the Synechocystis, including temperature and light intensity.<br>
Photosynthetic studies: Photosynthetic studies are performed in the way explained for plants above<br>
except untransformed and transformed Synechocystis cells are directly used to study the effect of mercury<br>
toxicity.<br>
