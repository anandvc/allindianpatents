OF<br>
Woo Young Kwak<br>
FOR<br>
ONE PIECE TYPE WIRELESS LOCAL LOOP SYSTEM<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of the Korean Application No. P2002-5841 filed on February 1, 2002, which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention<br>
(0002]      The present invention relates to a wireless local loop system, and more particularly, to a piece type wireless local loop terminal therein. Background of the Related Art<br>
[0003] In general, the wireless local loop (hereafter called as 'WLL') system provides wireless subscriber line, to connect between a local switching center and home or office, not by wire, but by radio, for providing voice, facsimile, and data communication services.<br>
[0004] The WLL is called as RITL (Radio In the Loop), FRA (Fixed Radio Access), FWA (Fixed Wireless Access), or PCS (Fixed Cellular System) in some countries, and a one of fields that draws attention of communication providers, recently. The WLL system has been devised by AT&amp;T Bell Laboratory in early 1970 for a sparsely populated region, such as fishing and agrarian villages, for reducing installation cost.<br>
[0005] However, because securing radio frequencies was not easy, and costs for manufacturing and installation of antennas and radio transmitters/receivers were excessive, the WLL system could not be put into practical use. However, as semiconductor and electronic communication technologies are developed rapidly in 1990s, the problems, such as of a frequency efficiency, a radio channel quality, and installation cost per a subscriber, are solved, such that many manufacturers produce economic products, the WLL system draws attention of the communication providers.<br>
|0006| The communication providers pay attention to the WLL system because of the following features of the WLL system.<br>
[0007] First, installation of subscriber lines is easier than a current subscriber line network in which the connection from a local switchboard to a subscriber home is made by a line, and a time period required until starting of service is short.<br>
[0008] Second, the WLL system has a merit in view of endurance of service because the WLL system can be used as an emergency subscriber line in case of damage to the current subscriber line network caused by a natural disaster, or the like.<br>
[0009] Third, the WLL system can provide flexible services with respect to a variety of service requirements, such as POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service), data service, ISDN.<br>
[0010] Fourth, installation cost is fixed regardless of distance, to have a little initial investment cost, and collection of the investment is fast.<br>
[0011] Fifth, a WLL system network can be expanded quickly according to an increased subscriber communication.<br>
[0012| The WLL having the foregoing features is considered to be the most potent method for construction of a subscriber network quickly by a new telephone service provider, or a new communication service provider, and particularly, paid attention as a fundamental communication structure of a developing country that has a POTS.<br>
[0013] In the meantime, though the WLL is similar to a mobile communication network in view that radio channels are used as communication media, the WLL has an advantage in that the WLL has an electronic wave environment substantially better than the electronic wave environment of the mobile communication network because the WLL has no mobility. Besides, the WLL had the following features in comparison to the mobile communication network.<br>
|0014| Though the environment of the mobile communication network has a wave path loss in a range of 40dB/decade as the environment is a non-line-of-sight environment<br>
because of blocking, reflection, and refraction of a straight wave by surrounding buildings as the antenna is located at a place lower than the surrounding buildings, the environment of the WLL has a wave path loss as low as 20dB/decade as the environment is a line-of-sight environment because the antenna is located at a rooftop and a mobility of the antenna is limited, permitting to serve a larger area by using the same power.<br>
[0015] Because the electronic wave environment of the WLL is a stationary communication of a point to point type, the electronic wave environment of the WLL has substantially less fading caused by multiple paths than the electronic wave environment of a mobile communication network that has a point to mobile station type.<br>
[0016] The WLL requires no hand-over as the WLL is a stationary radio communication network. Therefore, the WLL requires no reserve radio channels for the hand-over that is required for a communication service without discontinuation of a call in the mobile communication network. These reserve radio channels may be used for general calls permitting to obtain effects of an increased radio channel efficiency and an increased subscriber capacity. Radio link between a building and a base station can be constructed in a direction for reducing interference to a particular subscriber, and, because there is no change of the radio link unless the subscribers are increased too much or a cell is divided, a design of the WLL is substantially simpler than a mobile communication network.<br>
[0017] Moreover, the stationary radio communication of the WLL permits to use directional antenna on forward/backward links for reducing an identical channel interference to respective subscribers, that in turn permits to reduce a distance of frequency re-use. The reduction of frequency re-use distance brings about an increased subscriber capacity per a unit<br>
area.<br>
[0018]       Basically,  the WLL  is provided  with  a telephone set. an  NIU  (Network<br>
Interface Unit) that makes a wireless communication between the telephone set and a local switching center possible, a base station, a base station controller, a base station managing device, and the like, of which functions will be explained.<br>
[0019] The NIU is located at a final stage of network elements for carrying out functions of transmission/reception of a radio signal, modulation/demodulation of a radio channel, voice compression/decompression, and access to a PSTN terminal. There may be various forms of terminals depending on applied technologies, such as a form of terminal a RF function is built-in, a form of terminal RF function is provided separately, and a handset form, and the like, and a single line, or multiple line may be provided.<br>
[0020] The base station is located between the NIU and the base station controller, and connected to the NIU by radio, and to the base station controller by line, for transmission/reception of a radio signal, power control, modulation/demodulation of a channel, protocol transform for signal transmission/reception with the NIU and the base station controller. The base station is provided with an antenna transmitter/receiver, a power amplifier, channel cards, and hardware for interface with the base station controller.<br>
[0021] In making a radio access between the NIU, the base station has a limitation of a capable cell radius caused by limitations in the electronic wave environment and a radio power, to require the base station controller for effective access to a wireless section and a wire section. The base station controller is located between the local switching center and the base station, for connecting the local switching center and the base station and managing the base station. The base station controller is connected to respective base stations by wire mostly, and for managing radio resources, transcoding, base station managing, and a function of base station and switchboard match.<br>
[0022]       The base station managing device has functions of managing and maintenance<br>
of entire equipments in the WLL, such as network system managing, performance managing, data processing, software management, security management, and the like.<br>
[0023] The telephone set and the NIU correspond to a WLL terminal of the present invention. There are a separate type WLL terminal and one piece type WLL terminal in the foregoing WLL terminal depending on connection between the telephone set and the NIU.<br>
[0024] That is, the separate type WLL terminal has a stationary telephone set. and an NIU separated from each other to be connected by wire for purchase of, not the telephone set, but the NIU only, when a subscriber having the stationary telephone set connected to an existing wire network intends to subscribe to the WLL.<br>
[0025] The one piece type WLL terminal has a telephone set and the NIU integrated as one unit in hardware basis, for convenience of a subscriber who has no stationary telephone set connected to an existing wire network.<br>
[0026) A related art one piece type WLL terminal will be explained. FIG. 1 illustrates an outside view of the related art WLL terminal, and FIG. 2 illustrates a block diagram of the related art WLL terminal.<br>
[0027] Alike a general wire telephone set, the related art WLL terminal is provided with a body 1 having a telephone unit and the NIU built therein, a handset 2 separated from the body 1, and a coil line 3 connected between the handset 2 and the body 1, for transmission/reception of a signal as a hook switch is switched on/off following putting down the handset 2 on the body 1, or holding up the handset 2 from the body 1.<br>
[0028] In the meantime, if the user intends to make a call, the user holds up the handset 14 to switch on the hook switch, and dials a telephone number on the key pad 19. for assignment of a channel to the base station, to make a call available by the method explained before. On the WLL. system may be connected to an external instrument (computer.<br>
facsimile, or the like) through the data interface part 17 for making communication.<br>
[0029]      However, the related art WLL terminal has the following problems.<br>
[0030] First, since the related art WLL terminal is required to be stationary for receiving power through the AC adapter, the related art WLL terminal is not convenient in use.<br>
[0031] Second, short range carriage of the WLL terminal is difficult, because the WLL terminal has a 2-piece structure of separated handset and body, bulky, and uses a utility power.<br>
[0032] Third, in the case of communication with the external instrument (a computer, or a facsimile) through the data interfacing part by connecting the WLL terminal thereto, most of the data interlacing parts have been RS232C (Recommended Standard 232 Revision C) which transmit data in series. However, the RS232C has a slow transmission rate, requires many pins for two transmission and reception lines, five control lines, and one earth line, and needs a separate line driver module for compensating difference of signal levels of a PC signal level and a WLL terminal signal level when the PC is connected to the WLL terminal.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
[0048] Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. The present invention relates to a piece type WLL terminal with a built-in USB, of which USB will be explained, at first.<br>
[0049] The USB is developed by the USBO formed by Intel, Microsoft, Compac, IBM, NEC, DEC, and Nortel and etc., leaders of an information and communication field, who appreciate necessity of interconnection for growth of a CTI (Computer Telephony Integration) industry through standardization. The USB, not only permits connection up to 127 devices by automatic sensing without requiring re-booting or set up when a new peripheral device is connected thereto, but also supports a data transmission rate of up to 12Mbps, and permits a power supply of 5V/500mA. Accordingly, all the computers in the market since 1998 are provided with a USB port. As the USB is put into practical use, the USB is supported starting from Window 98 perfectly, and devices employing the USB are increased, rapidly. Accordingly, the present invention suggests fitting the USB to the WLL terminal for permitting communication from a PC with the USB to the one piece type WLL terminal.<br>
[0050] FIG. 2 illustrates an outside view of a piece type WLL terminal in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, mounted on a charger, FIG. 3 illustrates an outside view of a piece type WLL terminal, with a charger separated therefrom in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, and FIG. 4 illustrates a block diagram of a piece type WLL terminal and a charger in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[0051]      Referring to FIG. 2, the WLL terminal, having a handset (speaker and a mic),<br>

The terminal is provided with a separate charger 200 for charging a battery thereof through an external charging circuit and a USB connector 300 provided to the charger 200 for communication between a USB in a PC 400 and the one piece type WLL terminal 100.<br>
[0052] The one piece type WLL terminal 100 and the charger 200 in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention will be explained briefly, with reference to FIG. 4.<br>
[0053] That is, the WLL terminal 100 has the USB 21 fitted in the MSM 12 thereof, and the USB line driver 22 fitted to the data interface part 17 thereof. Moreover, the WLL terminal 100 has a communication pin connector 23 connected to the USB line driver 22 for communication with an external PC, such that, when the one piece type WLL terminal 100 is put in the charger 200, the communication pin connector 23 of the one piece type WLL terminal 100 is connected to a communication pin connector 24 of the charger 200. Of course, the one piece type WLL terminal 100 and the charger 200 have separate power pin connectors 25 and 26 respectively, for supplying power.<br>
[0054] The charger 200 has the USB connector 300 fitted thereto and connected to the communication pin connector 25 for connecting the external PC 400 by a USB of the external PC 400 and a USB cable. The unexplained symbol in FIG. 4 is an adapter 500 for supplying power to the charger 200.<br>
[0055] In this instance, though the USB line driver 22 may be connected to the charger 200, the number of pins of the communication pin connector 23 or 25 between the terminal 100 and the charger 200 are increased to six because six lines are required between the MSM 12 of the WLL terminal 100 and the USB line driver 22, that is not efficient.<br>
[0056] Since the communication pin connector 23 and 25 and the power pin connector 24 and 26 fitted to the one piece type WLL terminal 100 and the charger 200 are two pin connectors respectively, and the USB cable has two data signal lines and two power lines, four lines in total, the USB connector 300 connected to the USB 27 of the PC 400 is a four pin connector. The pin connectors are illustrated in detail in FIG. 3.<br>
[0057] The one piece type WLL terminal 100 and the charger 200 of the present invention will be explained in more detail. FIG. 5 illustrates a circuit of a piece type WLL terminal in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[0058] Referring to FIG. 5, the WLL terminal 100 of the present invention is one piece type terminal including a RF transmission/reception part 11 for receiving a RF signal through an antenna, producing an IF (Intermediate Frequency) signal from the RF signal, converting the IF signal into a digital baseband signal through an amplifier and an analog/digital converter, and providing the digital baseband signal to an MSM (Mobile System Modem), and converting a digital baseband signal received from the MSM into an analog signal and an intermediate frequency signal, converting the IF signal into a desired RF band signal, and providing the RF signal to the base station through the antenna, the MSM 12 for decoding the digital baseband signal from the RF transmission/reception part 11 to produce an information data, coding an information data intended to transmit, converting the coded information data into a digital baseband signal, and providing the digital baseband signal to the RF transmission/reception part 11, a CODEC 13 for coding an analog voice signal from the mic into a digital voice signal, and providing the digital voice signal to the MSM 12, and decoding a digital voice signal from the MSM 12 into an analog voice signal and adjusting levels of respective voice signals, a speaker 14a for presenting the analog voice signal from the CODEC 13, a mic 14b for providing the analog voice signal to the CODEC 13,<br>
a USB 21 built in the MS M12 for making fast communication with an external PC, a USB line driver 22 built in a data interface part 17 for driving a line so that the USB 21 and the external PC make communication through the charger 200 and the communication pin connector 23. a memory 18 for storing a main program for driving the MSM 12, a RF calibration data, and a data related to user services, and a power supplying part 16 having a charge battery for supplying power to respective parts.<br>
[0059] Moreover, as explained in association with FIGS. 3 and 4, the external charger 200 has the connectors provided such that the communication pin connector 25 and the USB connector 300 each built in itself for permitting communication between the one piece type WLL terminal 100 and the external PC 400 by the communication pin connectors 23 of the one piece type WLL terminal 100. Moreover, the external terminal 200 is provided to charge the battery of the one piece type WLL terminal 100. By the way, the unexplained symbols are a key pad 19 having a send button and a ringer 20 for providing a ring signal.<br>
[0060] As shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, battery in the power supplying part 16 and the external charger 200 are connected by two pin types for charging the battery in the WLL terminal 100.<br>
[0061] By the way, the operation of the WLL terminal 100 of the present invention is required to press the send button for reception, and press the send button after pre-dialing or post-dialing in transmission.<br>
|0062] As explained, since the USB cable has two data signal lines and two power lines, the charger 200 can have power supplied thereto from the PC, not through a separate adapter, but through the USB cable.<br>
[0063] FIG. 6 illustrates a circuit of a charger of a piece type WLL terminal in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. That is. for permitting the<br>
WLL terminal 100 to receive a power from the PC 200 when the charger 200 is connected to the PC 200 by the USB cable, a power switching part 28 is further included for sensing connection of the USB cable to the USB connector 27 and supplying power from the PC 200 to the battery in the WLL terminal. Use of the USB is displayed by an LED.<br>
[0064] As has been explained, the WLL system of the present invention has the following advantages.<br>
[0065] First, the one piece type WLL system having a built in handset with a speaker and a mic and the power supply in a regular battery power supply type by charging a separate charger through an external charge circuit permits convenient use of the WLL system while carrying the WLL system within a short range like a general wireless telephone.<br>
[0066] Second, the fitting of the USB having a fast transmission rate and a small number of pins to the MSM and the connection to the PC with a built in USB permits a fast rate PC communication through the WLL terminal.<br>
(0067] Third, because the USB cable can have power supplied therethrough, the WLL terminal can have the power supplied thereto from the PC without any separate adapter.<br>
[0068] It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in one piece type wireless local loop system of the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.<br><br><br><br><br>
