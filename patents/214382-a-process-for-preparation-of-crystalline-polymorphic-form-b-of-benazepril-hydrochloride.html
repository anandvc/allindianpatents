				<td>The present invention is directed to a process for the preparation of crystalline polymorphic form B of Benazepril hydrochloride.<br>
The present invention relates to a new crystalline form of Benazepril hydrochloride. Benazepril hydrochloride Is known by the chemical name: 3-[I(1S)-1-(ethoxy-carbonyl)-3-phenylpropyl]amlnol-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-2-oxo-1 H-1 -benzazepine-1 -acetic acid monohydrochloride. Benazepril has the foitowing formula:<br><br>
Benazepril Is an orally-active ACE-lnhibitor, mari<eted as an antihypertensive. processes for the preparation of enantiomeric pure benazepril hydrochloride are described in ep-a-072 and us-a-4 publications by j.w.h. watthey et al. j. med. chem. vol. pages s.k. boyer helvetica chimica acta></eted>
The processes described in the publications mentioned above result in the isolation of Benazepril hydrochloride in one defined crystalline form, herein designated as Form A. However, It is known that pharmaceutical substances can exhibit polymorphism. Polymorphism is commonly defined as the ability of any substance to have two or more different crystal strctures. Drug substances may also encapsulate solvent molecules when crystallized. These solvates or hydrates are referred to as pseudopolymorphs. It is also possible that the amorphous form is encountered. Different polymorphs, pseudopolymorphs or the amorphous form differ in their physical properties such as melting point, solubility etc. These can appreciably influence pharmaceutical properties such as dissolution rate and<br><br>
bioavailability. It is also economically desirable that the product is stable for extended periods of time without the need for specialised storage conditions. It is therefore important to evaluate polymorphism of drug substances. We now have surprisingly found a novel crystalline form of Benazepril hydrochloride, herein designated as fomi B, with improved stability as well as the amorphous form of Benazepril hydrochloride.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is directed to the polymorphic Form B, the amorphous form of Benazepril hydrochloride, processes for the preparation of Fonm B and the amorphous form of Benazepril hydrochloride, as well as novel processes for the preparation of Form A.<br>
One object of the present invention is a crystalline polymorph of 3-[[(1S)-1-(ethoxy-carbonyl)-<br>
3-phenylpropyl]amino]-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-2-oxo-1 H-1 -benzazepine-1 -acetic acid<br>
monohydrochloride which exhibits a characteristic X-ray powder diffraction pattern with<br>
characteristic peal<s expressed in d-values at></s>
13.2 (vs), 10.7 (s). 8.8 (m), 6.4 (m), 5.87 (s), 5.75 (m), 5.35 (m), 5.26 (m), 4.87 (m), 4.66 (s),<br>
4.40 (m), 3.86 (m), 3.79 (m). 3.66 (m), 3.60 (m), 3.57 (m), 3.52 (m), 3.45 (m), 3.40 (m), 3.36<br>
(m), 3.27 (m), 3.18 (m), 2.95 (m), 2.72 (m), 2.65 (m);<br>
herein designated as Form B. Here and in the following the abbreviations in brackets mean:<br>
(vs) = very strong intensity; (s) = strong intensity; (m) = medium intensity; (w) = weak<br>
intensity; and (vw) = very weak intensity.<br>
Small changes in the experimental details can cause small deviation in the d-values of characteristic peaks in the X-ray powder diffraction patterns, see Figures 2 and 3 which are X-ray powder diffraction patterns for Form B.<br>
A discussion of the theory of X-ray powder diffraction patterns can be found in "X-ray diffraction procedures" by H.P. Klug and L.E. Alexander, J. Wiley, New York (1974).<br>
Furthermore, the present invention is directed to processes for the preparation of Form B of Benazepril hydrochloride.<br>

The amorphous form of Benazepril hydrochloride is characterised by a powder X-ray diffraction pattern substantially as depicted in Figure 4.<br><br>
The amorphous form of Benazepril hydrochloride can generally be prepared by evaporation of a solution of Benazepril hydrochloride in an organic solvent or water. Preferably by evaporation of a solution of Benazepril hydrochloride in one of the above organic solvents, especially in a C2-C10ketone, like acetone. According to another preferred embodiment evaporation of a solution of Benazepril hydrochloride in water is carried out. The evaporation is preferably carried out in vacuum at ambient temperature. It is also possible, to carry out evaporation at elevated temperatures.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention is directed to processes for the preparation of Form A of Benazepril hydrochloride.<br>
Form A can generally be prepared by mixing of a solution of Benazepril hydrochloride (preferably a concentrated solution of Benazepril hydrochloride) in an organic solvent, like Ci-Cioaicohols, N-methylpyrrolidone (NMF) or N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), with a non-solvent like alkanes or acetates, especially C4-C12alkanes or C1-C10acetates, especially hexane or ethyl acetate. Preferred organic solvents are C1-C4alcohols, like methanol and preferably ethanol. It is preferred to add an alcoliolic solution of Benazepril hydrochloride to the non-solvent, especially to heptane or ethyl acetate.

Although the most suitable route in any given case will depend on the nature and severity of the condition being treated, the most preferred route of the present invention is oral. The dosages may be conveniently presented in unit dosage form and prepared by any of the methods well-known in the art of pharmacy.<br>
Dosage forms include solid dosage forms, like tablets, powders, capsules, suppositories, sachets, troches and losenges as well as liquid suspensions and elixirs. While the description is not intended to be limiting, the invention is also not intended to pertain to true solutions of Benazepril hydrochloride whereupon the properties that distinguish the solid forms of Benazepril hydrochloride are lost. However, the use of the novel forms to prepare such solutions is considered to be within the contemplation of the invention.<br><br>
