				<td>INTRODUCTION<br>
The present invention provides novel (S)-2-amino-3-(4-amino phenyl) propanol. The novel (S)-2-amino-3-(4-amino phenyl) propanol has the formula I<br><br>
This novel compound is useful as an intermediate for the preparation of (S)-4-(4-aminobenzyl)-2-oxazolldinone.(S)-4-(4-aminobenzyl)-2-oxazolidinone having the formula (II)<br><br>
The compound of the formula II prepared is useful for the preparation of<br>
zolmitriptan.  Zolmitriptan is    an    important drug for    the treatment of<br>
migraine.<br>
The invention also relates to a process for the preparation of the novel<br>
compound of the formula I<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
In the literature only two processes are available to prepare (S)-4-(4-aminobenzyl)-2-oxazolidinone of formula (I). In the first route disclosed in WO 9118897 (corresponding to US 5466699), the process for the preparation of compound of formula (I) comprises<br><br>
(i) esterification of (S)-4-nitro-phenylalanine give (S)-methyl-4-nitro phenyl alanate of the formula (III).<br><br>
(2) Reducing the connpound of formula (III)   with   sodiumborohydride to give (S)-4-nitrophenylalanilol of the formula (IV).<br><br>
(3)Cyclising the   compound of formula (IV)   using phosgene to give (S)-4 (4-nitrobenzyl)l,3-oxazolidinone of the formula (V).<br><br>
(4)Hydrogenating  the compound of the formula (V)   with 5% Pd-C to give (S)-4- (Aminobenzyl)-l,3-oxazolidinone of the formula (I).<br>
The main draw backs in this process are :<br>
1.	Yield reported in the step No.3 is 41%.<br>
2.	Process involves use of phosgene which is dangerous and not preferable on a commercial scale.<br>
3.	Overall yield from step (1) to step (4) is 17%.<br><br>
The  second   route  disclosed   in   [WO  97/06162,   WO   97/06163]     which comprises of following steps;<br>
a)	Forming a carbamate from methyl-4-nitro-(L)-phenylalanate HCI<br>
represented by formula (III) by the action of sodium carbonate (or)<br>
sodium hydrogen carbonate and n-butylchloroformate to give methyl<br>
(S)-N-butoxycarbonyl-4-nitrophenyl alanate of the formula (VI).<br><br>
b)	Reduction of the nitro group in the compound of the formula (VI) to give<br>
methyl (S)-N-butoxycarbonyl-4-aminophenylalanate of the formula(VII).<br><br>
c)	Reduction of the methyl ester group (- CO2CH3) in the compound of<br>
formula (VII) to give (S)-N-butoxycarbonyl-4-aminophenylalaninol of the<br>
formula (VIII).<br><br>
d)	Ring closure of the compound of the formula (VIII) with 30% sodium<br>
methoxide in methanol gives (S)-4-(Aminobenzyl)-l,3-oxazolidinone of<br>
the formula (II).<br><br>
This process involves relatively more expensive reagent butyl chloro formate in step (a) and step (d) needs extremely dry conditions and involves use of anhydrous sodium methoxide. These critical process parameters are very difficult to maintain consistently in a process plant, more so while taking scale up on commercial batches. Yields are not mentioned in the patent for any of the stages mentioned. However, we have found that experimentally only 20-25% overall yields are realized.<br>
Considering the importance gained of Zolmitriptan for the treatment of migraine for which the compound of the formula is an important intermediate there is a great need for developing a simple inexpensive and safe method for the commercial scale preparation of (S)-4-(4-aminobenzyl)-2-oxazolidinone of the formula 11.<br>
Therefore the main objective of the present invention is to provide a novel intermediate (S)-2-amino-3-(4-amino phenyl) propanol of the formula I which is useful for the preparation of(S)-4-(4-aminobenzyl)-2-oxazolidinone (II) which is inexpensive, scalable, high yielding and safe.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of compounds of the formula I which is useful for the preparation of compounds of the formula (II) which is not only simple but also convenient and useful for commercial production.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of the novel intermediates(S)-2-amino-3-(4-amino phenyl) propanol of the formula (I)<br><br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
Keeping in view of tine difficulties in commercialization of the processes disclosed in the above mentioned prior art patents, we aimed our research work to develop a simple and convenient process for the preparation of the oxazolidinone of the formula (II) which can be utilized for the preparation of zolmitriptan of the formula (A).<br><br>
In our sustained research to develop a simple process for the preparation of the oxazolidinone of the formula (II), we observed that a promising approach for developing such a process would be to.<br>
a)	Avoid the usage of phosgene in the ring formation step.<br>
b)	Reduce the nitro group present in  the compound of the formula (IV) with appropriate reducing agent before the cydisation step.<br>
c)	Use of dialkylcarbonates like dimethyl carbonate, diethyl carbonate in ring formation step.<br>
Accordingly we focused our research on the above mentioned directions. Following the above directions we are successful to develop an improved process for the preparation of oxazolidinone of the formula (II).<br><br>
Accordingly we observed that the ring formation step can be carried out in the presence of an amino group present on benzene ring of compound of formula the (I). <br>
We also found further that dialkyi carbonates used in the ring formation step gave better yields than the phosgene method (30-35% higher overall yield).<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of novel   intermediate   of   the   formula   I   useful   for   the   preparation   of<br><br>
oxazolidinone of the formula (II) which comprises:<br>
(I)   Preparing   the   4-nitro-(S)-phenylalaninol   of     the   formula   (IV)   by conventional    methods.<br>
(ii)  Reducing the nitro compound of formula (IV) by hydrogenation in the presence of a metal catalyst in alcoholic solvents under pressure at a temperature in the range of 25-80°C, to produce a novel intermediate of the formula (II) and<br>
(iii) Isolating the reduced product of the formula (II) by filtration of catalyst<br>
The 4-nitro-(S)-phenylalaninol of formula (IV) in the step (i) may be prepared by following the method described in the US patent No. 5466699.<br><br>
For example 4-nitro-(S)-phenylalaninol of formula (IV) may be prepared as follows:<br>
Esterlflcation of (S)- 4-nitro phenylalanine with methanol, and thionyl chloride at -10°C yields (S)- methyl-4-nitro phenylalanate hydrochloride of the formula (III).<br>
Compound of the formula (III) on reduction with sodium borohydride in aqueous ethanol medium yields compound of the formula (IV).<br><br>
The metal catalyst used in step (ii) may be Raney nickel, Palladium/carbon, Platinum/carbon, preferably Raney nickel or 5% palladium on carbon. The amount of catalyst employed may range from 5% to 20% weight. The reduction step may also be carried out by using metal/acid eg. SnClz/HCI, Fe/HCI and the like.<br>
The alchoholic solvent used may be selected from methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and the like<br>
The solvent used in step (ii) may be selected from methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, etc., preferably methanol. The hydrogen pressure used in case of catalytic hydrogenation may be in the range of 20-80 psi preferably in the range of 40-60 psi. The temperature of the hydrogenation may be preferably in the range of 30-40°C.<br>
A particularly preferred reaction scheme for the preparation of the compound of the formula (II) is :<br><br><br>
