THE	FOLLOWING	SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY  DESCRIBES  THE   INVENTION AND  THE  MANNER  IN  WHICH  IT  IS TO  BE PERFORMED.  <br><br>
Description<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an auto jig trimmer and a method of manufacturing a pattern frame by using the same, capable of manufacturing the pattern frame during the manufacturing process for clothes such that the pattern frame has a uniform pattern width throughout the entire length thereof.<br>
Background Art<br>
Clothes are made through various steps of forming a pattern according to a design prepared by a designer, cutting cloth along the pattern, and sewing the cloth.<br>
In this process, the pattern is generally made of paper, but this paper pattern is easily torn or crumpled, so that the paper pattern has bad durability. Accordingly, the paper pattern is not suitable when the same clothes are fabricated in mass production. For this reason, the pattern is made of a synthetic resin film having a thickness from 0.5 mm to 1.5 mm.<br>
The pattern made of the synthetic resin film is not easily torn or crumpled, so the film pattern is suitable for mass production of the clothes. This film pattern is bonded to another synthetic resin film having a thickness from 1.5 mm to 2 mm in order to fabricate a pattern frame by using a jig trimmer shown in FIG. 1.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, a jig trimmer 1 is provided with a body 3, one side of which is mounted on a base 2 having a flat top surface, a motor 4 that is located on the other side of the body 3 which is spaced apart from the base 2 by a certain distance and that has a drill 5 rotatably installed on a lower end thereof, and an adjustment lever 6 mounted on one side of the motor 4 to adjust a vertical height of the motor 4.<br>
A structure of the base 2 located below the drill 5 is illustrated in FIG. 8.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8, the base 2 is provided therein with a circular jig seat 22, on which a circular axial jig 11 is seated.<br>
The axial jig 11 includes a drill insertion hole 12 formed at the center of the axial jig 11 to receive the drill 5 when the drill 5 moves down, and a circular guide step 13 protruding from the circumference of an upper end of the drill insertion hole 12. The jig seat 22 has a depth equal to a height of the axial jig 11, so that, when the axial jig 11 is seated on the jig seat 22, the top surface of the base 2 is flush with that of the axial jig 11, and only the guide step 13 protrudes from the base 2.<br>
A process of processing the pattern frame on the basis of the above-mentioned<br><br><br>
pattern by using the jig trimmer 1 is illustrated in FIGS. 9 through 12.<br>
First, referring to FIG. 9, a pattern 30 fashioned into a desired shape is attached to a pattern frame 40, which has not been cut, so that the pattern 30 protrudes from the pattern frame 40 by its thickness. The pattern shown in FIG. 9 is an example for providing the flap of a dress pocket.<br>
In order to cut the pattern frame 40 according to the pattern 30, the jig trimmer 1 is used. The cutting sequences are illustrated in FIGS. 10 and 11.<br>
As shown in FIG. 10, an inner line of the pattern 30 protruding from the pattern frame 40 is brought into contact with an outer circumference of the guide step 13 protruding from the base 2. In this state, the drill 5 moves down, and then the pattern frame 40 is pushed along the inner line of the pattern 30. Thus, the pattern frame 40 is formed with an inner slot 41 cut along the inner line of the pattern 30.<br>
Thereafter, as shown in FIG. 11, similarly to the above process, an outer line of the pattern 30 is brought into contact with the outer circumference of the guide step 13. In this state, the drill 5 moves down, and then the pattern frame 40 is pushed along the outer line of the pattern 30, so that the pattern frame 40 is cut off. As a result, as shown in FIG. 12, the pattern frame 40 having the inner slot 41 formed inside and an outer cutoff section 42 formed outside can be obtained.<br>
After two pattern frames 40 obtained in this way overlap with each other, cloth is interposed between them, and then the inner slot 41 and the outer cutoff section 42 are seated on a needle plate of an automatic sewing machine (not shown). A sewing process is carried out. This sewing process is well known, so the detailed description thereof will be omitted.<br>
Here, in order to allow the obtained pattern frames 40 to be subject to the sewing process in the automatic sewing machine without a trouble, a pattern width 43 between the inner slot 41 and the outer cutoff section 42 must be uniform throughout the pattern without deviation.<br>
If the pattern width 43 is not uniform, the automatic sewing machine does not smoothly operate, thereby lowering productivity as well as causing non-uniform sewing resulting in quality degradation of clothes.<br>
Disclosure of Invention Technical Problem<br>
Accordingly, the present invention has been made to solve these various problems occurring in the prior art, and an object of the present invention is to provide an auto jig trimmer capable of processing a pattern frame having a uniform pattern width<br><br><br>
between an inner slot and an outer cutoff section without causing deviation over the entire length of the pattern frame when the inner slot and outer cutoff section of the pattern frame are processed.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a method of manufacturing a pattern frame using the auto jig trimmer, capable of obtaining the pattern frame of an improved quality.<br>
Technical Solution<br>
In order to accomplish these objects, according to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided an auto jig trimmer comprising a base having a flat top surface, a body provided at a front side thereof with a motor and mounted on the base, a drill rotatably coupled to a lower end of the motor, and an adjustment lever mounted on a predetermined portion of the motor so as to adjust a vertical height of the motor. A circular guide step protruding upward from the top surface of the base is provided below the drill, a disk seat having a predetermined depth is formed in the base, and one of thin and thick disk jigs of different heights is seated on the disk seat. According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of processing a pattern frame, the method comprising the steps of: preparing a pattern having a predetermined thickness, in which only one side line profile is formed, attaching the pattern to a pattern frame having a predetermined thickness, and seating a thin disk jig on a disk seat of a base of the auto jig trimmer; bringing the one-side line profile of the pattern protruding from the pattern frame into contact with an outer circumference of a guide step protruding from the base, and forming an inner slot in the pattern frame by means of the drill while the pattern frame is moving along the line profile; and replacing the thin disk jig with the thick disk jig, seating the thick disk jig on the disk seat of the base of the auto jig trimmer, bringing the one-side line profile of the pattern protruding from the pattern frame into contact with an outer circumference of the thick disk jig protruding from the base, and forming an outer cutoff section in the pattern frame by means of the drill while the pattern frame is moving along the line profile.<br>
Advantageous Effects<br>
As can be seen from the foregoing, in the auto jig trimmer and the method of manufacturing a pattern frame using the same according to the present invention, when a pattern is formed according to a fashion design, only a part of the pattern is formed on a pattern frame, so that it is easy to manufacture the pattern frame. When the pattern frame is processed by the auto jig trimmer using thin and thick disk jigs of different<br><br><br>
heights, an inner slot and an outer cutoff section are processed on the basis of the same upper line of the pattern, i.e. using one reference line, so that the processing error range of a pattern width is reduced.<br>
Furthermore, the pattern frame processed by the improved method allows an automatic sewing machine to smoothly operate when a needlework is performed by the automatic sewing machine, so that productivity can be improved, and obtain a high quality of clothes having a uniform sewing line.<br>

Mode for the Invention<br>
Hereinafter, exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings of FIGS. 1 to 7.<br>
FIG. 1 is a schematic side view of an auto jig trimmer. FIGS. 2 and 3 are sectional views of portion A of FIG. 1, in which an assembled structure of a jig and its seat are illustrated.<br>
Here, the same reference numerals are used in FIGS. 2 through 7 to refer to the elements identical to those of the prior art.<br>
An auto jig trimmer 1 illustrated in FIG. 1 is comprised of a body 3, one side of which is mounted on a base 2 having a flat top surface, a motor 4 that is located on the other side of the body 3 which is spaced apart from the base 2 by a certain distance and that has a drill 5 rotatably installed on a lower end thereof, and an adjustment lever 6<br><br><br>
mounted on one side of the motor 4 to adjust a vertical height of the motor 4.<br>
Here, the improvement of the present invention is a jig section 10 in which a axial jig 11 is seated on a jig seat 22 of the base 2, as shown in FIGS. 2 and 3.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, the jig section 10 is provided with the circular jig seat 22 formed on the base 2, and the circular axial jig 11 is adapted to be seated on the jig seat 22. The axial jig 11 includes a drill insertion hole 12 formed at the center thereof and admitting the drill 5 when the drill 5 is lowered, and a circular guide step 13 protruding from the circumference of an upper end of the drill insertion hole 12. The jig seat 22 has a depth equal to a height of the axial jig 11, so that, when the axial jig 11 is seated on the jig seat 22, the top surface of the base 2 is flush with that of the axial jig 11, and only the guide step 13 protrudes on the base 2.<br>
Further, an upper edge of the jig seat 22 is formed with a disk seat 21, which is recessed in a circular shape at a predetermined depth. The disk seat 21 is adapted to allow a thin disk jig 14, at the center of which a hole 14a having a diameter equal to an outer diameter of the axial jig 11 is formed, to be seated thereon.<br>
At this time, because the thin disk jig 14 has a height equal to a depth of the disk seat 21, the top surface of the base 2 is arranged in line with the top surface of the thin disk jig 14 when the thin disk jig 14 is seated on the disk seat 21.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates a state where, instead of the thin disk jig 14 removed from the disk seat 21, a thick disk jig 15, at the center of which a hole 15a having a diameter equal to the outer diameter of the axial jig 11 is formed, is seated on the disk seat 21. The thick disk jig 15 is thicker than the thin disk jig 14, so that the thick disk jig 15 protrudes from the top surface of the base 2 when being seated on the disk seat 21. Here, preferably, a protruding height of the thick disk jig 15 is substantially identical to that of the guide step 13 protruding from the axial jig 11.<br>
The thin disk jig 14 and the thick disk jig 15 can be removed from the disk seat 21 and exchanged with each other if necessary. A process of processing the pattern frame on the basis of the above-mentioned pattern using the improved auto jig trimmer 1 is illustrated in FIGS. 4 through 7.<br>
FIGS. 4 through 7 are perspective views illustrating a process of processing a pattern frame using an auto jig trimmer according to an embodiment of the present invention, and plan views illustrating the pattern frame.<br>
First, referring to FIG. 4, a pattern 30a fashioned into a desired shape is attached to a pattern frame 40, which has not been cut, so that the pattern 30a protrudes from the pattern frame 40 by its thickness. The pattern shown in FIG. 4 is an example for cutting the flap of a dress pocket as described in the conventional process, but it is different from that of the conventional process in that only an upper line profile of the pattern 30a is formed so as to allow only a shape of a lower portion of the flap to be<br><br><br>
processed.<br>
In this manner, because only the upper line profile of the pattern 30a is formed without forming the remaining line profile of the pattern 30a, it is easy to manufacture the pattern frame. Further, although the remaining line profile of the pattern 30a is not formed, the pattern frame having a uniform pattern width between an inner slot and an outer cutoff section on the whole can be obtained by characteristic construction and process of the present invention.<br>
In order to cut the pattern frame 40 according to the pattern 30a, the auto jig trimmer 1 is used. The cutting sequences are illustrated in FIGS. 5 and 6.<br>
As shown in FIG. 5, the thin disk jig 14 is seated on the disk seat 21 formed at the base 2 so as to allow the top surface of the base 2 to be flush with that of the thin disk jig 14, and only the guide step 13 formed at the axial jig 11 protrudes on the base 2.<br>
An upper side of the pattern 30a protruding from the pattern frame 40 is brought into contact with an outer circumference of the guide step 13 protruding on the base 2 as described above. In this state, the drill 5 is lowered, and then the pattern frame 40 is pushed along the upper line profile of the pattern 30a. Thereby, the pattern frame 40 is formed with an inner slot 41 cut along the upper line profile of the pattern 30a.<br>
Thereafter, the thin disk jig 14 is removed from the base 2, and then the thick disk jig 15 is seated on the disk seat 21 as shown in FIG. 6. Thus, an outer circumference of the thick disk jig 15 protrudes on the base 2.<br>
Then, the upper side of the pattern 30a is brought into contact with the outer circumference of the thick disk jig 15. In this state, the drill 5 is lowered, and then the p attern frame 40 is pushed along the upper line profile of the pattern 30a, thereby being cut off. As a result, as shown in FIG. 7, the pattern frame 40 has the inner slot 41 formed inside, and an outer cutoff section 42 formed outside and spaced apart from the inner slot 41 at the same width on the whole.<br>
To sum up, the outer cutoff section 42 in the process of FIG. 6 is cut on the basis of the same line as described in the process of FIG. 5, i.e. the upper line of the pattern 30a with no change. In this manner, it is possible to reduce a processing error in comparison with the processing of the inner slot and the outer cutoff section on the basis of different lines, i.e. the inner and outer lines of the pattern 30. Thus, according to the process of the pattern frame 40 in the present invention, the entire pattern width 43 between the inner slot 41 and the outer cutoff section 42 can be uniformly established without deviation, which is particularly advantageous when cutting an angled or curved portion.<br>
After two pattern frames 40 obtained in this way overlap with each other, cloth is interposed between them, and then the inner slot 41 and the outer cutoff section 42 are seated on a needle plate of an automatic sewing machine (not shown). A sewing<br><br><br>
process is carried out. This sewing process is well known, and irrelevant to the subject matter of the present invention, and so its detailed description will be omitted.<br><br><br>
