				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for analyzing the presence of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis bacilli in a sample and a device for rapid, and easy test method for detection of presence of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis bacilli by reaction with very specific monoclonal or polyclonal antibody directed against them. This complex is made to react with conjugate to obtain a visual colour on the device membrane. A built in control dot is provided to validate the efficacy of the reagents used in the test and to validate the compliance of the procedural steps.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Tuberculosis is a persistent problem in the developing world and biggest cause of morality. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the causative agent of tuberculosis. Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections often results in pulmonary disease but can cause skin infections, lymphadenitis, meningitis, and other manifestations beside advent of AIDS has made the disease a major public health problem which has recently been exacerbated by increasing numbers of high-risk patients. For more than a Century detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis generally relieves on a combination of staining of acid fast bacilli (AFB) and culture. AFB staining is unable to identity the species of different mycobacterium while culture needs 6 weeks time for result interpretation. So, inadequacies of the sputum smear test and the rise of TB epidemic have renewed efforts to develop new and innovative approaches to TB diagnosis. Diagnos TB Ag kit has been developed as a rapid direct antigen diagnostic tests which demonstrate a superior performance against the widely used sputum smear test and the current gold standard culture method.. As Diagnos TB Ag kit is an antigen based test, it has several advantages over antibody based test. Firstly, they don't rely on the host immune system to detect disease - often problematic when the host is immune<br>
comprised. Secondly, they can measure concentrations of pathogen in real time in the host, which can then be directly related to disease progression.<br>
Also, the field of the diagnostic and clinical microbiology has continued to evolve and yet there remains a general need for systems that provide rapid and reliable detection of the diseases and infection due to microorganisms such as M. Tuberculosis. There is a new sense of urgency regarding the reporting of acid fast smear cultures and drug susceptibility results to physicians, prompted in large part to the emergence of multi-drug resistant strains of tuberculosis (Nolte and Metchock supra at p. 400). Traditionally tuberculosis surveillance has involved the use of preliminary skin tests (e.g. tuberculin tests) with positive beings further evaluated for active diseases by radiographic analysis and sputum cultures. Other samples are sometimes submitted to the laboratory for culture including blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (e.g. cerebrospinal (CSF), pleural peritoneal pericardial etc.), tissues (e.g. lymph nodes, skin, or other biopsy materials), abscess, aspirated fluids.<br>
Culture methods: Once the specimen is received by the laboratory suspected of containing mycobacteria, the specimen will generally be stained and examined for the pres nee of AFB. Sputum and other dirty specimens are decontaminated and concentrated prior to the staining, culturing and immunobiological methods. Methods for diagnosis of tuberculosis based on immunologic methods such as detection of delayed type sensitivity skin responses as well as the detection of an i-mycobacteria antibodies or mycobacterial antigens have been studied. The tuberculin skin test, still commonly used, was the first immuno diagnostic test developed for detection of tuberculosis.<br>
Vscan test kit is available in the market by which rapid flow through diagnostic test can be carried out for the antibody detection being the antibody detection kit. Only serum or blood can be used for the antibody detection test. Moreover<br>
antibody detection tests are unreliable because antibody formation in case of MTB is delayed and slow.<br>
In comparison, antibody detection suffers from the problem that host immunoglobulin levels can remain high many years after the pathogen has been cleared from the body. Thus Rapid diagnosis of TB bacilli in patients can lead to fewer ultimate complications and avoidance of unnecessary treatment.<br>
Nucleic acid PCR based genetic test: DNA detection test where a single DNA molecule is amplified in the presence of Taqpol enzyme in thermocycler. It is sensitive technique which requires skill, knowledge and sophisticated instruments to run PCR.<br>
US Patent NO: 6291178 describes a method and apparatus for the preservation of a saliva sample for use in subsequent quantitative chemical assays. The method involves collecting a saliva sample at a location, directly into a specimen cup. The specimen cup contains a predetermined volume of aqueous solution of pH buffered saline and enzymatic inhibitor and is optionally adapted with a constituent compound specific, qualitative test unit.<br>
U3 Patent No. 6383763 describes methods and compositions for the detection of infection and disease due to members of the genus Mycobacterium. In particular, the present invention is well-suited to the detection and identification of patients with disease or infection due to M. tuberculosis or MAC.<br>
US Patent No. 6583266 features nucleic acid and proteins derived from K'ycobacterium tuberculosis and leprae. The proteins and nucleic acid of the p asent invention have applications in diagnostics and therapeutics.<br>
The main disadvantage of the culture is the need for more sophisticated rt sources and more qualified technicians because specificity can suffer due to<br>
careless technique. The total test time may take 3-4 weeks for confirmation of results. Sometimes the slide preparation is not perfect. Diagnostic delay of culture kills time and clinical interpretations.<br>
In US Patent No. 6506384, a number of protein and glycoprotein antigens secreted by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mt) have been identified as "early" Mt antigens on the basis early antibodies present in subjects infected with Mt prior to the development of detectable clinical disease. These early Mt antigens, in particular an 88 kDa secreted protein having a pi of about 5.2 and the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 106, which is present in Mt lipoarabinomannan-free culture filtrate, a protein characterized as Mt antigen 85C; a protein characterized as Mt antigen MPT51, a glycoprotein characterized as Mt antigen MPT32; and a 49 kDa protein having a pi of about 5.1, are useful in immunoassay methods for early, rapid detection of TB in a subject. Preferred immunoassays detect the antibodies in the subject's urine. Also provided are antigenic compositions, kits and methods to useful for detecting an early Mt antigen, an early Mt antibody, and immune complexes thereof.<br>
US Patent No. 6599691 describes a rapid, non-invasive, semi-quantitative immunoassay of saliva to aid in the diagnosis of diseases, e.g., using saliva to detect subjects actively or previously infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a causative organism of tuberculosis. The semi-quantitative assay comprises spotting disease-related antigens on the surface of a solid substrate; contacting the solid substrate with a saliva sample which, in positive subjects, contains primary antibodies to the disease-related antigens; contacting the primary antibodies with a label capable of being detected; and detecting and reading the label whereby exposure to the antigens is determined. The device for conducting these assays is a frame or support which holds a solid substrate capable of immobilizing the antigens of interest while permitting drainage of other materials or fluids away from the immobilized antigens, A less rapid, quantitative assay has also been developed by adapting the rapid, semi-quantitative assay to an<br>
enzyme linked immunosorbant assay thereby providing a quantitative assay capable of assessing multiple saliva samples simultaneously.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for direct bacilli detection / observation using antigen antibody complex formation system.<br>
