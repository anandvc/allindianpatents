BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1 .       Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to the field of communications. More particularly, the present invention relates to a system and method for creating a remote digital agreement formulated through an execution procedure.<br>
2.       Description of Art Related to the Invention<br>
Over hundreds of years, written agreements have been used as a vehicle for a variety of purposes, among which is to establish certainty and clarity in business, legal and other types of arrangements between two or more parties to the agreement. In general, one type of an agreement is a "contract", which is defined as a promise or<br>
set of promises between two or more parties by which the law allows the party or parties that abide by the terms of the contract to recover damages (e.g., monetary compensation) from the party or parties that breach the contract. Another type of agreement is a stipulation agreement used during litigation in which the parties agree to material facts not in dispute. Although there exists a wide variety of execution schemes, one type of scheme is where the parties to the contract negotiate "at arm's length" to formulate terms of the written agreement (e.g., contract) which are mutually agreeable to the parties.<br>
After agreeing to the terms of the written agreement, the parties select an execution procedure for signing the agreement. The nature of that execution procedure may depend on the importance of the agreement, past dealings between the parties, and many other factors. The execution procedure may be overseen by a "non-signing party" acting as an arbitrator (referred to as "independently-arbitrated agreement execution"), or by the parties themselves in a localized setting (referred to as "mutually-arbitrated agreement execution").<br>
Referring to Figure 1, mutually-arbitrated agreement execution is generally preferred when all of the parties or the signatories of the agreement 110 can meet at a selected location to execute one or more printed copies of the agreement 120.  This guarantees that each party possesses an original copy of the agreement upon adjournment of the meeting. Such meetings are costly and difficult to arrange, especially when the agreement involves a large number of parties.<br>
In the event that the simultaneous assembly of all parties is not feasible or undesirable, an alternative approach may include an independently-arbitrated execution procedure utilizing human arbitration as shown in Figure 2. For this execution procedure, each signatory 1101 and 1102 separately executes one or more copies of the agreement and provides the partially-signed agreements 1301 and 1302 to the arbitrator 140 (e.g., a third party who is not a signatory of the agreement). When receiving partially-signed agreements 1301 and 1302 from all of the parties, the arbitrator 140 provides a copy of the fully-signed agreement 1501 and 1502 back to each signatory 1101 and 1102. The disadvantage associated with this execution<br>
procedure is that it is entirely dependent on the integrity of the arbitrator 140 to properly follow a static procedure. However, it is apparent that it is quite difficult and costly, especially for parties situated in other countries and/or in different states, to check the integrity of the arbitrator. Likewise, the cost of the arbitration service itself and the time delay in execution of the written agreement may be unacceptable.<br>
Referring now to Figure 3, another execution procedure (referred to as "non-arbitrated execution") is applicable when the written agreement is of lesser value or when a sufficient degree of trust exists between the "n" signatories ("n" being a whole number, n&gt;3 in this example). One signatory 1101 starts the execution process by signing the agreement and forwarding the partially-signed agreement 1601 on to the next signatory 1102. As each successive signatory receives the partially-signed agreement, it applies its own signature and forwards it to another signatory until the agreement is fully executed. The last signatory 1 l0n has the responsibility to return copies of the fully-executed agreement 1701, 1702,... 170nl to all signatories, as did the arbitrator in Figure 2. This method has the advantage of cost reduction, since the signatories need not be assembled nor is an arbitration fee incurred. The significant disadvantage is that the success of the process is dependent on the integrity of the last signatory who is a party to the agreement. The last signatory is not compelled to redistribute copies of the signed agreement, especially if a business advantage can be gained by being in possession of the only signed agreement.<br>
Recently, a number of states have passed legislation that recognizes private key-based digital signature as legally binding a party to the terms of a digital agreement. A "digital agreement" is an electronic document representing an agreement that is to be digitally signed by all parties to the agreement through their respective private keys. Like written agreements, digital agreements may be executed through independent-arbitration, mutual-arbitration, or nonarbitration execution procedures. However, it is evident that cost and time saving advantages offered by digital agreements would be greatly reduced by following an independently-arbitrated execution procedure or a mutually-arbitrated execution procedure. Thus, it has been desirable for digital agreements to undergo non-arbitrated execution as shown in Figure 4.<br>
Referring to Figure 4, after negotiating the terms of the digital agreement 205, a first party at a first node 200 (e.g., computer) normally signs the digital agreement 205 by (i) applying a hash algorithm (e.g., "MD5" algorithm developed by RSA Data Security of Redwood City, California) to the digital agreement 205 to obtain its unique hash value 210, and (ii) encrypting the hash value 210 with an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm (e.g., RSA algorithm) under its private key ("PrKA") to produce a "first digital signature" 215. It is contemplated that such hashing is not necessary, but may be used to reduce the amount of data thereby preserving bandwidth during transmission and memory during storage. Thereafter, at least the first digital signature 215 is transferred to another party at a second node 220. Additional information may be transferred in combination with the first digital signature 215 such as the digital agreement 205 or its hash value 210. Optionally, some or all of this information may be protected during transfer (for privacy purposes) by encrypting with a previously chosen symmetric key.<br>
The execution procedure can be continued in a serial manner by the party at the second node 220 creating its own digital signature 230 (e.g., in this embodiment, hash value 225 encrypted under a private key "PrKB" of the party at the second node 220). Thereafter, an aggregate signature set 235 (including the first and second digital signatures 215 and 230 and possibly additional information) to the next party of the agreement. This procedure may continue for an arbitrary number of parties with the final party at node 240 being responsible for returning the fully-signed digital agreement 250 (i.e., in this case, a hash value of the agreement individually encrypted with the private keys of each party to the digital agreement to all of the other signatories.<br>
Referring now to Figure 5, if the first digital signature 215 is created by encrypting the hash value 210 under the private key PrKA, the first digital signature 215 may be validated by any party with access to the hash value 210 (or the original digital agreement 205. Such validation is accomplished by decrypting the first digital signature 215 with a well-known public key ("PuKA") associated with the first party at node 200 to produce a resultant value 260. Thereafter, the resultant value 260 is compared to a previously obtained or computed hash value 210 of the digital<br>
agreement 205 as shown. If the resultant value 260 and the hash value 210 are identical, the first party is deemed to have signed the digital agreement. This procedure may be performed to validate the signature of any of the signatories.<br>
As realized by viewing Figures 4 and 5, this nonarbitrated execution procedure for digital agreement clearly poses a risk to all signatories, except the final signatory 240 in the event that the final signatory 240 fails to return a copy of the fully-signed digital agreement to each of the other signatories 200 and 220. For example, if the agreement requires a first signatory to make a monetary payment, to supply goods, or to provide services to the final signatory and the first signatory has not yet received the fully-signed digital agreement from the final signatory, the first signatory risks breaching the agreement if it does not act in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Moreover, if the final party later decides to not abide by the terms of the agreement, the first party may have only limited legal recourse to retrieve its monetary payment or return of its goods. This is due to the fact that the first party only has a copy of a partially-signed digital agreement, not the fully-signed agreement which may have been erased, destroyed, or never signed by the final party. Regardless of the outcome, this non-arbitrated execution procedure allows the business arrangement to be controlled by the final party signing the digital agreement by the accidental or intentional failure to return the fully-signed digital agreement.<br>
In a recent cryptography publication by Bruce Schneier entitled "Applied Cryptography" (2nd Edition), an overview is presented of protocols for non-arbitrated, "simultaneous" execution of digital contracts, attempting to address the issue of one signatory to a digital contracts having an advantage over another. These are very tedious, communication intensive protocols, based on each signatory taking a great number of steps in the signature process to build up complete signatures from the other signatories. However, this publication fails to provide a simple protocol for arbitrated execution of digital agreements and a protocol that does not exclusively depend on the integrity of the arbitrator.<br>
Therefore, it would be desirous to create a system and method for reducing the risks associated with execution of digital agreements, while maintaining the cost, time, and convenience advantages of remote execution.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A digital arbitration system comprising a arbitration node and one or more signatory node(s) coupled together through a communication link. Each of the signatory node(s) may include a unique private key which is used to digitally sign a message, forming a digital signature, and transmit the digital signature over the communication link to the server node. Alternatively, if only one signatory node is used, each party's signature may be created within a removable personal token supplied by that party. The server node transmits an acknowledge signal or the digital signatures from the parties to each of these parties upon receiving all of the digital signatures and determining that each of the digital signatures is valid.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
The present invention relates to a system and method for digitally signing a digital agreement between remotely located nodes in a manner which precludes fraudulent withholding of the fully-signed digital agreement in an effort to gain an unfair advantage over a contractual business arrangement. In the following description, numerous details are set forth such as certain configurations of a digital arbitration system in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be obvious, however, to one skilled in the art that other system configurations may be utilized while still practicing the present invention.<br>
In the detailed description, a number of cryptography-related terms are frequently used to describe certain characteristics or qualities which is defined herein. A "key" is an encoding and/or decoding parameter being a sequence of binary data that is used by cryptographic algorithms (e.g., Rivest, Shamir and Adleman "RSA", Digital Signature Standard "DSS", Elliptic Curve, etc.) as public and private key pairs, or used by cryptographic algorithms (e.g., Data Encryption Standard "DES") as a selected "session" key shared in confidence between the two parties. A "message" is digital information, for example, an electronic document or a hash value of one or more electronic document(s) if hashing is utilized. A "digital signature" is digital information resulting from information encrypted with a private key of a party. Such information may include, but is not limited to, an electronic document, a hash value and the like.  This digital signing process allows a recipient of the digital signature to verify the identity of the party sending the digital signature. This may be accomplished by decrypting the digital signature with a public key corresponding to the private key of the signing party. A "certificate" is defined as digital information resulting from information, typically a public key associated with the holder of the certificate, encrypted with a private key held by another entity (e.g., manufacturer, arbitration service provider "operator" responsible for the arbitration system, trade association, governmental entity and the like).<br>
Referring to Figure 6, a first embodiment of a digital arbitration system is illustrated. The digital arbitration system 300 comprises an arbitration node 305 such as, for example, a computer functioning as a server. The arbitration node 305 is coupled to one or more signatory nodes 3101-3 l0m ("m" &gt; 1 and a whole number) through a communication link 315. The signatory nodes 3101-310m may include any device capable of communicating with the communication link 315 and producing digital signatures. Examples of such devices include, but are not limited to, personal computers, servers, mainframes, workstations, PDAs (personal digital assistants), telephones, etc.<br>
The arbitration node 305 contains a cryptographic device 320 that is capable of operating as a digital arbitrator by collecting digital signatures produced from signatory nodes 3101-310m. The signatory nodes 3101-310m may be owned or controlled by each party of a digital agreement having nodes 3101-3 l0m, or alternatively one signatory node may be controlled with an ability to receive personal tokens (e.g., circuitry configured to securely store one's private key) having a private key associated with the party securely implemented thereon. Thus, one signatory node placed at a centralized location may be used by the parties of the digital agreement.<br>
Thereafter, copies of all of these digital signatures (collectively representing the fully-signed digital agreement) may be returned to each of the parties after certain conditions have been met. It is contemplated that the fully-signed digital agreement may be stored in the arbitration node 305 with acknowledgment signals sent to each of the parties that agreement has been signed by all parties. Copies of the agreement may be requested by any of the signatories or may be sent after signing is completed.The communication link 315 may be accessible to the public at large (e.g., Internet) or accessible to a lesser number of individuals as in a local area network ("LAN") or a wide area network ("WAN"). This communication link 315 provides bi-directional communications between the arbitration node 305 and the signatory nodes 3101-310m representing one or more parties to the digital agreement so that the arbitration node 305 transmits and receives information to produce a legally<br>
enforceable digital agreement. The procedure undertaken by the arbitration node 305 for exchanging information is discussed below in detail.<br>
Referring to Figure 7, the cryptographic device 320 comprises an internal bus 400 interconnecting a processing unit 405, non-volatile memory unit 410, an optional volatile memory unit 415 (as denoted by dashed lines), an optional random number generator 420 (as denoted by dashed lines) and a bus control unit 425. The non-volatile memory unit 405 contains at least the public/private key pair 411 and 412 uniquely associated with the cryptographic device 400. It is contemplated that as arbitration software 413 may be contained within the non-volatile memory unit 405 or may be stored outside the cryptographic device 320, assuming such software its cryptographically protected. When in operation, the arbitration software 413 performs one or more arbitration protocols. The bus control unit 425 controls data transmission between the cryptographic device 400 and the communication link 315, establishing communications with any one of the "in" signatory nodes remotely located from the arbitration node 305.<br>
Optimally, the volatile memory unit 410 may be utilized as temporary storage by the processing unit 405 during execution of arbitration software 413. The random number generator 420 may be used in the initial generation of the public/private key pair 411 and 412 contained in the nonvolatile memory unit 410. It is desirable to implement the random number generator 420 to guarantee that a private key of a unique public/private key pair has not been exposed in readable form outside the cryptographic device 320. Also, the cryptographic engine hardware represented by symmetric (e.g., DES-based) and asymmetric (e.g., RSA-based) encryption/decryption units may be implemented, as indicated by dashed lines, to assist in cryptographic operations.<br>
It is contemplated, however, that the cryptographic device 320 may be implemented in a number of alternative embodiments. For example, the cryptographic device may be implemented with discrete logic on a printed circuit board, or implemented within a chip set operating in cooperation with a host processor. There exist many embodiments which, although slightly different in design, do not deviate<br>
from the spirit and scope of the invention. An example of such an alternative embodiment is illustrated in Figure 8.<br>
Referring to Figure 8, a second embodiment of the digital arbitration system 500 is illustrated in which the collective cryptographic operations are performed by the arbitration node 505. In contrast to the description of Figures 6-7, the arbitration node 505 does not employ the general purpose cryptographic device. Instead, the arbitration node 505 may be implemented with hardware or dedicated to exclusively handle cryptographic arbitration operations.<br>
As shown, the digital arbitration system 500 comprises the arbitration node 505 coupled to a number of signatory nodes 5101-510n through a communication link 515 (e.g., Internet, LAN, WAN, etc.). The arbitration node 505 contains a dedicated hardware arbitration device 520 (e.g., programmable logic devices, state machines, etc.) that primarily performs arbitration functions without being implemented with other general capabilities. The advantage of this type of embodiment is that it may have cost advantages over other embodiments. Once authentication of the dedicated hardware arbitration device 520 is performed (as detailed in following sections), no further authentication is required since the functionality of the arbitration node 505 is not easily modifiable due to its fixed or static hardware implementation.<br>
Referring to Figure 9, a third embodiment of the digital arbitration system is illustrated in which the collective cryptographic operations are performed by a computer at a platform level (e.g., host processor, memory, etc.), not by a specific cryptographic device as described in Figures 7 and 8. The digital arbitration system 600 comprises the arbitration node 605 coupled to a number of signatory nodes 6101-610m through a communications link 615 (e.g., Internet, LAN, WAN, etc.). The arbitration node 605 is configured with arbitration software stored in memory (e.g., Random Access Memory "RAM", various types of Read Only Memory "ROM", flash memory and the like). The arbitration software is coded to produce similar functionality to that provided the cryptographic device, as shown in Figure 10 and discussed below, when the host processor is executing instructions associated with the code. However, this implementation does not provide an ability to remotely<br>
authenticate the arbitration software implemented within the arbitration node 605 to guarantee its operation in a manner designated by the parties. Rather, the parties need to rely on the integrity and reputation of the owner or controller of the arbitration node 605.<br>
Referring now to Figure 10, the operations of the arbitration node mplemented with one of the three embodiments of Figures 6, 8 and 9 to produce a fully-signed digital agreement are shown. First, in Step 705, the parties can mutually verify that each party is authorized to enter into the digital agreement. This can be accomplished verbally over the phone or, when dealing with business entities, by exchanging a digital certificate signed by a private key ("PrKTA") of a trusted authority (e.g., a partner or officer of the business, security office, etc.). The public key of the trusted authority ("PuKTA") should be widely available or verifiable through additional digital certificates or a digital certificate chain. Then, the parties negotiate the terms and wording of the digital agreement and specify the required signatories, including their public keys (Step 710). Next, the parties seek out and tentatively agree on a digital arbitrator, such as those shown in Figures 6, 8 and 9 (Step 715). Upon agreeing on a digital arbitrator as shown in Figures 6 and 8, the parties check whether the digital arbitrator is implemented with an appropriate and acceptable arbitration mechanism. Otherwise, for a digital arbitrator utilizing only arbitration software as in Figure 9, authentication of the arbitration mechanism is not performed, but rather of the owner or operator of the arbitration node. Thus, reliance is placed on the reputation of the owner or controller of the arbitration node (Steps 710-725).<br>
More specifically, in the event that the arbitration node employs a cryptographic device having either a dedicated arbitration functionality as shown in Figure 8 or general cryptographic functionality configured for arbitration (e.g. via software or firmware) as shown in Figures 6-7, authentication of the cryptographic device may be performed by a number of authentication procedures. One authentication procedure is by at least one of the parties requesting the arbitration node's (or cryptographic device's) public key ("PuKARB") and its manufacturer's certificate. Normally, the manufacturer's certificate is a message indicating that the<br>
arbitration node was manufactured by a certain company.  Both the manufacturer's certificate and the public key are encrypted with a private key of a reputable manufacturer or trusted authority (e.g., a trade association, governmental entity, etc.) whose public key is widely disseminated. Thus, the parties can obtain PuKARB and send a challenge message to the arbitration node requesting a response to the message, this requested response being the message encrypted with the private key ("PrKARB") of the arbitration node. If the party can read the response by decrypting it with PuKARB, the arbitration node has been authenticated to be the device that the parties have sought.<br>
If a general purpose cryptographic device configured for arbitration via software or firmware is employed within the authentication node of the arbitration system as in Figures 6-7, an additional authentication operation may be performed to ensure that an acceptable version of such firmware/software is installed. This authentication operation consists of querying the previously authenticated cryptographic device for details of its configuration. Based on the authenticity and known functionality of the cryptographic device and its firmware/software, a determination is made as to the acceptability of the installed arbitration protocol.<br>
If the arbitration functionality is implemented as software running on the arbitration node under the control of an arbitration service provider, alternative methods of authenticating both the node and its configuration may be required. For example, one technique is to authenticate the node using a "Challenge-Response" authentication technique. Normally, the Challenge-Response authentication technique involves at least one of the parties sending a message requesting an "operator" certificate from the node. The "operator" certificate includes a message indicating that the node is under the control of the arbitration service provider and a public key of the node. Both the message and the public key of the node are encrypted with a private key of the arbitration service provider. The message and public key of the node can be obtained by decrypting the operator certificate with the public key of the arbitration service provider. Thus, authentication of the arbitration node is implicit depending on the reputation of the arbitration service provider who may be legally responsible for the operations of the arbitration node.<br>
Of course, the highest degree of overall execution security and integrity is achieved when each party of the agreement performs these authentication operations and does so in an independent fashion. If the arbitrator authentication cannot be completed, a new digital arbitrator is selected by returning to Step 715.<br>
In Step 730, each signatory digitally signs the digital agreement by encrypting a hash value of the digital agreement or the digital agreement itself (if hashing is not desired) with its private key. This digital signature, along with a signatory list and preferably, although not required, a copy of both the digital agreement or an equally acceptable alternative representation (e.g. hash value of the digital agreement), is then transferred to the digital arbitrator. This communication to the digital arbitrator is confidential, such as being protected through standard cryptographic means, typically by encrypting at least the digital signature with a temporary session key shared between the signatory and the digital arbitrator. This prevents the illicit capture of the digital signature by antagonistic parties, for use prior to the availability of the fully signed digital agreement from the digital arbitrator.<br>
For each individual message received from the various signatories in Step 735, the digital arbitrator performs the operations described in Step 740. These include (i) comparing the received digital agreement (or its acceptable alternative representation) against all versions of the agreement previously received, (ii) comparing the received signatory list against all versions of the signatory list previously received, and (iii) validating the digital signature using the public key of the signatory derived from the signatory list in the manner described for Figure 5. As shown in Step 745, the arbitrator must successfully complete all of the operations in Step 740 for all signatories before proceeding.<br>
If valid digital signatures are received from all signatories and all copies of the digital agreement and signatory list are identical, the agreement is deemed to have been fully executed and the arbitrator proceeds to Step 750. In Step 750, the arbitrator distributes an acknowledgment to each signatory indicating that the digital agreement has been fully signed. The digital agreement is contained in the arbitration node to be provided upon request by one of the signatories. Similarly, requests for a copy of the<br>
signatory list, or the set of signatures may be satisfied by the arbitration node. Alternatively, it is contemplated that the entire set of digital signatures associated with the digital agreement may be distributed with or without the use of the session key or asymmetric (public-private key) cryptography techniques.<br>
The present invention described herein may be designed in many different methods and using many different configurations. For example, the present invention may be utilized by escrow companies or other financial institutions for arbitrating the exchange of wired monetary payments for records of title (e.g., deed). Another example would be the remote electronic mutual stipulation to a set of facts as might occur in a judiciary proceeding. Likewise, it could be used by any state or federal regulated entities (e.g., Department of Motor Vehicles). While the present invention has been described in terms of various embodiments, other embodiments may come to mind to those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.
