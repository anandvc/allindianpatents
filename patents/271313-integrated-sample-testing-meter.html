				<td>Integrated Sample Testing Meter<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an integrated sample testing meter for use in<br>
sampling and analyzing analytes, particularly glucose, in fluids such as blood or interstitial<br>
fluid.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Glucose monitoring is a fact of everyday life for diabetic individuals. The accuracy<br>
of such monitoring can literally mean the difference between life and death. Generally, a<br>
diabetic patient measures blood glucose levels several times a day to monitor and control<br>
blood sugar levels. Failure to test blood glucose levels accurately and on a regular basis<br>
can result in serious diabetes-related complications, including cardiovascular disease,<br>
kidney disease, nerve damage and blindness. A number of glucose meters are currently<br>
available which permit an individual to test the glucose level in a small sample of blood.<br>
Many of the glucose meter designs currently available make use of a disposable test<br>
strip which, in combination with the meter, electrochemically or photometrically measures<br>
the amount of glucose in the blood sample. To use these meters, the user first punctures a<br>
finger or other body part using a puncture means, such as a lancet, to produce a small<br>
sample of blood or interstitial fluid. The sample is then transferred to a disposable test<br>
strip. The inconvenience of taking several measurements a day, as well as the pain<br>
inflicted by currently available puncture means, often discourage disciplined and frequent<br>
testing.<br>
While the fingertip is generally used for sampling blood, due to the rich capillary<br>
bed of the skin of the fingertip, the fingertip is also particularly sensitive to pain, due to a<br>
rich supply of pain receptors in the finger tip as well. When a puncture is too deep, too<br>
close to a recent puncture or not deep enough and requires an additional puncture, the pain<br>
increases significantly. Pain may also be increased if the puncture means penetrates slowly<br>
or is withdrawn slowly. Furthermore, the user may be forced to make a larger puncture<br>
than is necessary to form a sufficient amount of blood, due to losses during the transfer<br>
between the puncture site and the test strip.<br>
The process of measuring blood glucose levels requires several steps and several<br>
different accessories, including a puncturing device, a puncture means, a supply of test<br>
strips and a glucose meter. Each accessory has a different function. The user must have a<br>
flat surface available to unpack and lay down the accessories within easy reach. This, by<br>
itself, poses a challenge for those who need to take measurements while participating in<br>
outdoor activities. Flat surfaces are often not available and this can discourage a person<br>
from taking a measurement. This can be disadvantageous because blood glucose levels<br>
may change significantly during an outdoor activity.<br>
Even if a user can find a flat surface, the user has to carry out the following steps.<br>
The user: charges the puncturing device with a fresh puncture means; opens a vial of strips;<br>
removes a strip; inserts the strip into the meter; re-closes the vial; checks for the correct<br>
calibration code on the meter; picks up the puncturing device; lances the skin of the finger<br>
or other body part; lays down the puncturing device; squeezes or massages the finger to<br>
yield an adequate blood sample; transfers the sample to the test strip for analysis; waits for<br>
the meter to analyze the sample; removes the strip from the test meter; discards the strip;<br>
and finally re-packs all of the accessories. As set forth above, the standard procedure for<br>
taking a glucose measurement requires the use of multiple, separate components and the<br>
execution of a number of steps requiring manual user intervention.<br>
Generally, the user is required to transfer a small volume of sample to a sample-<br>
receiving area on the test strip. Generally, test strips are quite small and the sample-<br>
receiving area is therefore even smaller. This transfer step is a difficult task for many<br>
users. Moreover, there has recently been a trend towards the use of test strips requiring<br>
ever smaller amounts of sample. (This allows the use of smaller punctures and therefore<br>
less painful puncturing.) However, the use of smaller samples increases the difficulty in<br>
transferring the sample to the sample-receiving area on the test strip. This is especially<br>
difficult for users with poor eyesight, a common complication for diabetics.<br>
The pain, inconvenience, cost, slowness, complexity and discreteness of taking a<br>
blood glucose measurement are barriers to the frequent monitoring of glucose levels.<br>
Patients often do not comply with doctor recommendations to frequently test glucose levels<br>
due to the numerous obstacles involved.<br>
It is an aim of the present invention to provide, at least in part, a solution to the<br>
above problems.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides, in a first aspect, an integrated sample-<br>
testing meter comprising a single modular housing carrying:<br>
a puncture means;<br>
a drive train for driving the puncture means between an extended position and a<br>
retracted position;<br>
a test strip cartridge containing a plurality of test strips, each strip having a sample-<br>
receiving area;<br>
a sensor for analyzing a fluid sample received on a test strip; and<br>
a test strip dispensing system for moving test strips individually from the cartridge<br>
to a sample-receiving position in which the test strip is connected to the sensor,<br>
the meter being arranged such that, in use, when it is located in a first position on<br>
the skin of a user and is activated, the puncture means is moved to its extended position<br>
and retracted to form a puncture in the user's skin and a test strip is moved from the<br>
cartridge to the sample-receiving position.<br>
In use, after the puncture has been made, the user moves the meter to a second<br>
position where the sample-receiving area of the test strip is located in the drop and receives<br>
a sample from the fluid drop. The sensor then analyzes the sample.<br>
The meter of the present invention will include electrical or electronic circuitry for<br>
controlling its operation. Such circuitry may be hard-wired or may comprise a<br>
microcomputer or similar device. Such circuitry will in particular include all the<br>
components of the sensor and will be arranged to carry out the analysis of the sample.<br>
Preferably, the circuitry also includes a visual display unit from which the user can<br>
read out the result of any particular test. The display may also be adapted to provide a<br>
display of the data, as explained in more detail below.<br>
Preferably, the circuitry includes means, such as a touch sensitive display, control<br>
buttons or a microphone and voice activated software, for entering data into the meter.<br>
Preferably, the meter includes a pressure device arranged to facilitate the formation<br>
of a drop of fluid around the puncture.<br>
The pressure device may comprise a pump adapted to apply a negative pressure to a<br>
volume in the meter having an aperture for location on the skin of the user.<br>
Advantageously, the part of the meter forming the aperture through which the puncture<br>
means extends is made of a non-slip material so that the meter can be more securely<br>
located on the user's skin during the puncturing operation.<br>
Preferably, however, the pressure device comprises a pressure ring arranged to be<br>
located, in use, on the user's skin and to apply pressure at the edges of the ring to increase<br>
the amount of fluid available at the centre of the ring. Advantageously, the pressure ring is<br>
made of a non-slip material so that the meter can be more securely located on the user's<br>
skin during the puncturing operation.<br>
The pressure ring may be shaped to conform to the shape of the area of the skin to<br>
which it is to be applied. For instance, if the meter is intended for use on the forearm, the<br>
pressure ring will be generally planar. However, if the meter is intended for use on a<br>
finger, the pressure ring will be curved.<br>
Preferably, the pressure ring has a multi-contoured surface to increase the pressure<br>
gradient from the outside to the inside of the ring.<br>
Advantageously, the pressure ring is part of a cap which covers the puncture means<br>
in its retracted position. Preferably, the cap includes a means, such as a sidewall, which<br>
co-operates with the drive train to ensure that the puncture means travels along<br>
approximately the same path on each activation of die drive train.<br>
The cap may be an integral part of the housing. Preferably, however, the cap is<br>
detachably mounted on the housing. This may be achieved by use of screw-thread or<br>
bayonet type fixings, by use of a snap fit connection or by a hinged connection.<br>
If desired, the meter can include at least two interchangeable caps, for instance a<br>
cap for forearm use and a cap for finger use.<br>
The puncture means may be any of the types of puncture means at present in use in<br>
the art. The term "puncture means" includes lancets and finger-sticking devices of the type<br>
known in the art. Preferably, the puncture means is removably attached to the drive train<br>
so that the puncture means can be disposed of after one or several uses.<br>
Preferably, the drive train is spring driven. Alternatively, the drive train is driven<br>
electromagnetically. The drive train is arranged such that, on actuation, the puncture<br>
means moves to the extended position and is retracted.<br>
Preferably, the drive train includes an adjustment screw which allows the user to set<br>
the extended position of the puncture means. This enables the user to calibrate the<br>
operation of the meter such that his or her skin is punctured sufficiently to allow a large<br>
enough drop of fluid to form without causing too much pain.<br>
Advantageously, the operation of the adjustment screw is arranged such that the<br>
distance of travel of the puncture means remains constant, however much the extended<br>
position of the puncture means is changed. This ensures that the amount of pain<br>
experienced by the user does not increase disproportionately to the depth of puncture.<br>
Where the meter includes a cap, it is preferable, as noted above, that the cap<br>
provides a means for guiding the drive train so that the puncture means punctures the skin<br>
at approximately the same place on each actuation of the drive train.<br>
Preferably, the test strip cartridge comprises a cartridge housing defining a cavity<br>
configured to receive a stack of test strips, a partially detachable cartridge cap and a means<br>
for moving the stack of test strips towards the cartridge cap.<br>
The test strips used for some measurements are air- or moisture- sensitive. It is<br>
therefore preferred that the cartridge includes a seal for sealing the cartridge cap to the<br>
cartridge housing when the cartridge cap is fully engaged with the cartridge housing. The<br>
seal may be on the cartridge cap or on the cartridge housing.<br>
In use, upon activation of the meter, the cartridge cap is partially detached from the<br>
cartridge housing to allow the first test strip in the stack to be moved by the test strip<br>
dispensing system to the sample-receiving position. Once the measurement has been<br>
taken, the cartridge cap is preferably manually replaced on the cartridge housing to close<br>
the cartridge and seal its contents from atmospheric effects.<br>
Preferably, the cartridge has on it data relating to the calibration code for the strips<br>
in the cartridge. The data may be present as visually readable indicia. In this case, the<br>
meter must include means, as mentioned above, to allow the user to enter the calibration<br>
code into the meter.<br>
Preferably, however, the data on the cartridge are present in machine-readable<br>
format, for instance as a bar code or a resistance bridge circuit or stored in an electronic<br>
memory module.<br>
If the data are present as a bar code, the meter will include a bar code reader. This<br>
may be a scanning reader or a stationary reader. A scanning reader will be more<br>
complicated but can be used when the cartridge is fitted in the meter. A stationary reader<br>
is less complicated but can only be used as the cartridge is inserted into or taken out of the<br>
meter.<br>
If the data are present in an electronic memory module, this may comprise a read-<br>
only memory (ROM), or a rewritable memory, such as an EPROM or EEPROM.<br>
Preferably, the data also include a unique number identifying the specific cartridge,<br>
the number of strips originally present in the cartridge, the expiry date for the cartridge,<br>
different calibration factors for different sources of fluid (neonatal, arterial or venous<br>
blood, for instance), an acceptable performance range and any other relevant information,<br>
preferably in machine-readable format, to assist in operation of the meter.<br>
Where the memory module on the cartridge is rewritable, the meter may be<br>
arranged to write back into the memory module information such as the number of strips<br>
used, the date the cartridge was first used, the length of time the cartridge has remained<br>
open and the date, time and result of each test that was carried, out with a strip from the<br>
cartridge.<br>
Preferably, the test strip dispensing system includes a slider adapted to engage with<br>
only one of the test strips in the cartridge and move it to the sample-receiving position.<br>
Advantageously, the meter includes a feeding channel which receives the strip from<br>
the cartridge and guides it to the sample-receiving position.<br>
Preferably,- the feeding channel includes a step arranged such that, when the strip<br>
has been moved past the step, the strip drops, or is forced, into the step, thereby preventing<br>
the strip from moving back towards the cartridge.<br>
Preferably, the strip is forced into the step by springs located on the meter.<br>
Advantageously, the springs are also electrically conductive and are arranged to make<br>
electrical contact with electrodes or a conductive bar on the strip (see below).<br>
Alternatively, the strips may be provided with cut-outs, for instance of triangular<br>
shape, which mate with spring-biased abutments which fit into the cut-outs to hold the strip<br>
in its sample-receiving position.<br>
Advantageously, the meter includes an ejection means for ejecting a used test strip<br>
from the meter once a test has been completed. Preferably, where the cartridge includes a<br>
cartridge cap, the ejection means is operated as the cartridge cap is closed.<br>
Preferably, the meter includes a deviator which prevents the test strip dispensing<br>
system moving a further test strip into the sample-receiving position while a first test strip<br>
is still in position. This is an advantageous feature as it allows the user to carry out a<br>
number of puncturing operations with the same strip in position, since, in some cases, it<br>
takes a number of puncturing operations, if necessary with adjustment of the penetration<br>
depth, to produce a sufficiently large drop of fluid.<br>
Preferably, the deviator operates in conjunction with the cartridge cap. While the<br>
cartridge cap is partially detached from the cartridge housing, the deviator blocks the<br>
normal path for the test strip dispensing system, such as the slider, and causes it to enter<br>
the cartridge cap rather than the regular path into the cartridge.<br>
Preferably, the meter includes a means for verifying that a strip is in the sample-<br>
receiving position. This may comprise a reflectance meter. Generally, test strips are more<br>
or less reflective than the surfaces of the feeding channel. Therefore, a change in<br>
reflectance will indicate that a test strip is in position.<br>
Preferably, however, the verifying means comprises an electrical system. At its<br>
simplest, each strip may have on it a conductive bar arranged to short out two electrodes on<br>
the meter. This arrangement is useful for strips arranged to carry out photometric<br>
measurements.<br>
Strips which are arranged to carry out electrochemical measurements already<br>
include electrode systems. Thus, the verifying means may include electrical contacts on<br>
the meter which contact the electrodes on the strip. Advantageously, as noted above, the<br>
electrical contacts on the meter are preferably spring-loaded and are positioned to force the<br>
strip into the step in the feeding channel.<br>
Advantageously, the verifying means is also used to activate fully the circuitry in<br>
the meter. The meter may normally be in a low power mode, where the only active<br>
circuitry is that used to control the verifying means. Once the verifying means has<br>
indicated that a strip is present, the meter can then automatically switch to high power<br>
mode where all its relevant circuits are functioning.<br>
Preferably, the verifying means is also arranged to start a timer in the circuitry of<br>
the meter. The timer is stopped by the ejection of a used strip from the meter, preferably<br>
by closure of the cartridge cap. This allows the circuitry to determine the length of time<br>
the cartridge has been open to the atmosphere. Advantageously the circuitry is arranged to<br>
sum the total time that the cartridge has been open and to produce a warning signal, such as<br>
an audible tone or a visible signal, if the total exceeds a pre-set maximum.<br>
Preferably, the circuitry in the meter also counts the number of strips dispensed<br>
from each cartridge. Advantageously, the circuitry is designed to provide a warning signal,<br>
such as an audible tone or a visible signal, when the number of strips remaining in the<br>
cartridge is low.<br>
Where the cartridge has on it data relating to an acceptable performance range,<br>
preferably the circuitry is arranged so that, if a control test gives a result outside the<br>
performance range, the meter is disabled while that cartridge is in the meter. This<br>
arrangement ensures that, if the strips in a particular cartridge have deteriorated, they<br>
cannot be used.<br><br>
As noted above, the cartridge preferably includes a rewritable memory module and<br>
the circuitry in the meter is arranged to write back to the cartridge memory module useful<br>
information, such as the number of strips remaining in the cartridge and the length of time<br>
the cartridge has been open to the atmosphere. The rewriting function is particularly useful<br>
where a user is likely to be away from his normal environment for a length of time which<br>
would require the use of more strips than are present in a cartridge. In such cases, a user is<br>
likely to remove the old cartridge and insert a new, full cartridge. Once the new cartridge<br>
has been used up, the user may insert the old cartridge, even if it is out of date. As long as<br>
the meter can read the data on the old cartridge, it will be able to decide whether use of the<br>
old cartridge should be allowed.<br>
Moreover, the provision of a rewritable memory module enables other possible<br>
uses. For instance, data on time and date of use and result of measurement may be written<br>
into the cartridge's memory module. The used cartridge could then be returned to the<br>
user's health care provider who could then study the data to determine whether the user is<br>
complying with his treatment and monitoring regime. Alternatively, the used cartridges<br>
could be returned to the manufacturer to enable a general study of use to be carried out.<br>
These data, illustrating the effective use of strips, may provide a tool for health care<br>
insurers to verify the actual usage of the strips they reimbursed.<br>
Preferably, the meter is activated manually by use of a single movement, for<br>
instance of a multi-functional assembly carried by the housing. The assembly may include<br>
a lever pivoted to the housing. Preferably, however, the assembly includes a slidable knob<br>
which slides to cock the drive train and move a strip into the sample-receiving position.<br>
The movement of the assembly may also activate all the meter's circuitry.<br>
The drive train may be fired either by further movement of the lever or, preferably,<br>
by actuation of a trigger.<br>
It can thus be seen that the use of the integrated sample testing meter of the present<br>
invention can be very simple. If desired, the user can replace an existing puncture means<br>
with a new one. The meter can then be cocked by use of the assembly. This also moves a<br>
strip into the sample-receiving position. Movement of the lever or receipt of a strip in the<br>
sample receiving position also activates all the meter's circuitry. Then, the user places the<br>
appropriate part of the meter, such as the aperture or the cap, on his or her skin and<br>
activates the trigger.<br>
If the first activation of the trigger does not cause the production of a sufficiently<br>
large drop of fluid, the meter can be cocked, positioned and fired again, if necessary a<br>
number of times, without the need to insert a new strip.<br>
Once sufficient fluid has accumulated around the puncture, the user moves the<br>
meter to the second position in which the strip is placed in the drop and its sample-<br>
receiving area takes up a sample of the fluid.<br>
Thus, the use of the meter of the present invention avoids most of the steps<br>
presently required and in particular avoids those steps where manual dexterity and good<br>
eyesight are advantageous.<br>
Preferably, the meter is adapted to produce and analyze a sample of blood- or<br>
interstitial fluid, in particular to analyze a blood sample for glucose levels. Strips adapted<br>
to carry out such measurements are well known in the art. These may be electrochemical<br>
or photometric strips.<br>
Advantageously, the strips are adapted to carry out electrochemical analyses and<br>
the circuitry in the meter is arranged to contact the electrodes in such strips.<br>
Therefore, in a preferred embodiment the present invention provides an integrated<br>
blood glucose testing meter. The integrated meter of this aspect of the present invention<br>
allows for a simple, one-step glucose monitoring process, and significantly reduces the<br>
obstacles involved in frequent glucose monitoring. The integrated meter provides for the<br>
automated dispensing and positioning of a test strip and puncturing of a user in a<br>
repeatable manner. After user-initiated transfer of a blood sample to the test strip,<br>
automated analysis of the blood sample takes place.<br>
According to still another aspect of the present invention, there is provided an<br>
integrated method of sampling and testing a blood glucose level or other analyte in a<br>
bodily fluid. The integrated method comprises loading a test strip cartridge into an<br>
integrated testing meter, activating an assembly on the testing meter to cock a puncture<br>
means drive train and move a test strip into a sample-receiving position, pressing the<br>
integrated testing meter on the skin of a user and pressing a trigger of the testing meter to<br>
drive a puncture means into the skin in order to form a drop of blood or other fluid on the<br>
skin surface. The user moves the meter such that the test strip can absorb a required<br>
amount of blood or other fluid for an automated analysis of the sample by the integrated<br>
testing meter.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides an integrated meter for sampling and analyzing a<br>
sample of bodily fluid, such as blood, including a disposable test strip cartridge having a<br>
stack of test strips disposed therein. The present invention facilitates the monitoring of, for<br>
instance, blood glucose levels by integrating into a single meter the steps involved in<br>
sampling and analyzing blood into a simple process employing a single meter.<br>
The present invention will be described below relative to an illustrative<br>
embodiment. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the present invention may be<br>
implemented in a number of different applications and embodiments and is not specifically<br>
limited in its application to the particular embodiment depicted herein.<br>
The present invention will be discussed below in connection with sampling blood,<br>
although those of ordinary skill will recognize that other types of fluid can also be used.<br>
Figures 1 to 3 illustrate an integrated blood glucose sampling and testing meter 10<br>
according to an illustrative embodiment of the present invention. This meter is designed to<br>
carry out electrochemical analysis of a blood sample. However, if desired, the same<br>
mechanical parts could be used in connection with photometric analyses. The sampling<br><br>
and testing meter comprises a modular housing 11 encompassing an integrated system for<br>
expressing and subsequently analyzing a sample. The meter 10 includes an assembly for<br>
puncturing the skin of a user to express a drop of blood on the surface of the skin. The<br>
assembly includes a lancet 13 as the puncture means and a drive train 14.for driving the<br>
lancet into and out of the skin.<br>
A transparent cap 16 is attached to the housing 11 by a hinge at the proximal end of<br>
the device 10. The housing 11 includes a recess 17 for enabling the cap 16 to be moved to<br>
the open position shown in Figure 2. In this position, the lancet can be removed and<br>
replaced. The cap 16 also includes an aperture to allow passage of the lancet 13 through<br>
the cap 16 and into the skin of the user. The cap 16 can have a multi-contoured surface in<br>
order to promote, enhance or facilitate the expression of blood by pressing the device onto<br>
the skin. The assembly further includes, a depth adjustment knob 18 situated at the distal<br>
end of the drive train opposite the lancet. Rotation of the depth adjustment knob decreases<br>
or increases the puncture depth of the lancet. The depth adjustment knob regulates or<br>
adjusts the puncture depth in accordance with known techniques.<br>
A test strip cartridge 19 is loaded into the meter 10 and includes a stacked supply of<br>
test strips disposed within a cavity or hollow interior of the cartridge housing. The test<br>
strip cartridge is adapted to dispense individual test strips to a feeding channel 20. The<br>
outlet of the feeding channel leads to the exterior of the meter 10.<br>
The housing may include an internal wall that defines the inner side of the cap 16.<br>
Alternatively, the housing wall can have a frusto-conical or funnel shape, or any other<br>
suitable shape, for precisely controlling the movement of the lancet.<br>
The cap is precisely dimensioned such that the lancet 13 slidably passes through the<br>
cap. In this arrangement, the lancet 13 is precisely positioned at about the same location<br>
each time it is deployed. Correspondingly, each test strip is precisely positioned at about<br>
the same location each time one is moved from the cartridge to the sample-receiving<br>
position.<br>
The test strip cartridge 19 comprises a replaceable and disposable portion of the<br>
sampling and testing meter. When the supply of test strips is depleted or expired, the user<br>
may open the meter 10, as shown in Figure 3, remove the used test strip cartridge 19 and<br>
insert a new test strip cartridge containing a fresh supply of test strips. The details of the<br>
test strip cartridge 19 are described in depth below.<br><br>
A strip dispensing system operates in co-operation with the test strip cartridge 19 to<br>
dispense test strips one-by-one through the feeding channel 20 and into the sample-<br>
receiving position to effect the sampling and analysis of a blood sample. According to the<br>
illustrated embodiment, when a user slides knob 21 of the meter 10 away from the cap 16,<br>
the strip dispensing system pushes the foremost test strip in the stack out of the test strip<br>
cartridge and into the feeding channel. According to a preferred embodiment, knob 21<br>
performs an additional function of simultaneously cocking the lancet assembly to prepare<br>
the lancet assembly for puncturing the skin of a user when the user presses the cap 16 to<br>
the skin. The workings of the strip dispensing system and knob 21 are described in further<br>
detail below.<br>
To enable electrochemical analysis of the sample, the meter further includes<br>
electrical contacts situated in the feeding channel 20 and configured to contact electrodes<br>
formed on the test strip. The electrical contacts connect to electronics 22 located within<br>
the modular housing 11 of the sampling and testing meter. The electronics are arranged<br>
such that, once die contacts contact the electrodes in the strip, the meter switches from<br>
"low" power made to "high" power mode.<br>
The test strip generates electrochemical signals that are passed by the electrical<br>
contacts to the housing electronics. The electronics process the signal and calculate the<br>
glucose level or other electrochemically detectable analyte of the blood or interstitial fluid<br>
that is sampled by the testing device. The electronics transmit instructions for an<br>
appropriate display or output regarding the analysis.<br>
As shown in Figure -4, the feeding channel 20 has in it a pair of arms which are<br>
biased to move towards each other. Each arm has at its free end a triangular abutment 31.<br>
The strips have in them triangular cut-outs 33. When a strip is fed into the feeding<br>
channel, the abutments 31 on the arms 30 snap into the cut-outs 33 to hold the strip in the<br>
sample receiving position.<br>
Alternatively, the feeding channel may include a step located adjacent the electrical<br>
contacts. The electrical contacts are spring biased so that, once a test strip is in the sample-<br>
receiving position, the electrical contacts bear on the test strip and locate it securely in the<br>
step.<br>
In either manner, the strip is prevented from moving backward away from the<br>
sample-receiving position.<br>
The integrated sampling and testing meter 10 includes a visual LCD display 34 for<br>
displaying information related to the analysis of the sample. According to the illustrative<br>
embodiment, the information in the display includes a measured blood glucose level in a<br>
blood sample, as well as the time and date of the measurement. The display may also<br>
provide information regarding the number of test strips remaining in the test strip cartridge,<br>
the operating temperature, the expiration date of the test strip cartridge, instructions to the<br>
user and the like. According to one practice of the invention, test results are stored in<br>
memory in the meter and the display 34 allows a user to view prior test results.<br>
The meter also has on its outside buttons 35 which can be used by the user to enter<br>
data into the meter's electronics. This may be achieved by using the buttons to navigate<br>
through one or more menus displayed on the display 34.<br>
To measure blood glucose levels with the integrated meter 10, a user first slides the<br>
knob 21 away from the cap 16 to simultaneously cock the lancet assembly and<br>
automatically open the test strip cartridge and to advance a test strip from the cartridge<br>
through the feeding channel 20 to the sample-receiving position shown in Figure 1. The<br>
user then presses the cap 16 against a body part, such as a finger or forearm. This releases<br>
the lancet assembly, which fires the lancet 13 into the skin a predetermined depth and at a<br>
precise location. The lancet assembly immediately retracts the lancet from the skin.<br>
The cap 16 includes a pressure ring (not shown) so that, as the meter is pressed<br>
onto the skin before, during or after the puncturing has taken place, a drop of blood of the<br>
required size forms on the user's skin. The user then moves the meter to bring the sample-<br>
receiving area of the strip in the sample-receiving position into contact with the drop. As<br>
the blood contacts the sample-receiving area of the test strip, capillary force absorbs blood<br>
into the strip for analysis. The user holds the meter firmly against the skin until a sufficient<br>
amount of blood is absorbed into the test strip, generally for about 3 to 10 seconds.<br>
According to one practice, the meter 10 produces an audible or visible signal to the user<br>
indicating that a sufficient blood sample has been collected and that analysis has begun.<br>
The user then removes the meter from the skin and the electrochemical analysis of the<br>
sample continues until the result is displayed.<br>
The disposable strip cartridge 19 includes a number of components designed to<br>
facilitate automatic, one-by-one dispensing of the test strips. The test strip cartridge<br>
includes a vial housing, a cartridge housing including a stack of test strips, a cartridge cap<br>
and a push-up or biasing mechanism. The stack of test strips comprises about fifty test<br>
strips in vertical alignment. However, the test strip cartridge of the present invention is not<br>
limited to a stack of fifty test strips and may include any number of stacked test strips.<br>
The push-up mechanism biases the test strip stack towards the cartridge cap such<br>
that, when a foremost test strip is removed from the stack, the remaining test strips in the<br>
stack advance by one. After the foremost strip is removed from the stack, the next strip in<br>
the stack moves up and is ready to be dispensed for a subsequent analysis. The push-up<br>
mechanism includes a loader pressing against the last strip in the stack and a biasing<br>
element, such as a tensator. The tensator comprises a constant force clock spring that<br>
applies'a constant pressure to the stack.<br>
The push-up mechanism further includes a tensator retainer to secure a portion of<br>
the tensator to the cassette housing. The vial housing further includes notches to releasably<br>
lock the cartridge in the modular housing of the meter. When loading the cartridge 19 into<br>
the meter, the vial housing clicks unambiguously in place to ensure a precise fit.<br>
The cartridge cap includes a hermetic sealing element to protect the test strips from<br>
humidity, which can damage the test strips and compromise test results. Alternatively, the<br>
seal can be included in the vial housing where it meets the cap.<br>
According to one practice, the cartridge material itself can have desiccant<br>
properties, or desiccants can be disposed in the interior space of the vial. Any humidity<br>
that may migrate into the test strip vial is by these materials absorbed and neutralized.<br>
As can be seen from Figure 3, preferably the cap, the drive train, the sliding knob<br>
and a strip ejection lever (see below) are in a unitary subhousing which is pivotally<br>
attached to the remainder of the housing to allow for the insertion of a cartridge and the<br>
removal of used cartridges. The subhousing may be released by operation of release knob<br>
39.<br>
Preferably, the cartridge includes on it a re-writable memory module such as an<br>
EPROM or EEPROM chip. In this case, the electronics in the meter will include means for<br>
interfacing with the memory module so that the meter can read from and write to the<br>
memory module.<br>
The memory module will contain a calibration code for the cartridge and will<br>
preferably contain a unique code for the cartridge and its expiry date. It may also contain<br>
compensation factors for analyses of different fluids (such as venous, arterial or neonatal<br>
blood or interstatial fluid), the number of strips in the cartridge and other relevant<br>
information. The electronics in the meter will be set up to use any data stored m the memory module, in<br>
particular the calibration code.<br>
The electronics will also be set up to write to the memory module such information as the<br>
number of strips used, the length of time the cartridge cap has remained open, the date of first opening<br>
the cap, the date and times of each test carried out and the result of each test.<br>
The cartridge may alternatively include such data in other formats, such as in visible characters,<br>
as a bar code or as a resistor bridge circuit.<br>
The cartridge cap is releasably locked into place on the cartridge by a cap retainer. To allow for<br>
the strip dispensing mechanism in the meter to forward individual strips to the feeding channel 20, the<br>
cartridge cap includes a "pop-up" feature. The cartridge cap is flexibly attached to the vial housing by<br>
means of side supports, binges, springs or another suitable mechanism. Pushing the cap retainer releases<br>
the lock on the cartridge cap and allows the cap to pop up a predetermined amount, thereby allowing the<br>
foremost test strip in the stack to be fed to the sample-receiving position.<br>
The strip dispensing system cooperates with the pop-up cartridge cap described above to push<br>
the foremost test strip of a test strip stack into the feeding channel 20 in order to position the test strip in<br>
the sample-receiving position. As discussed, the strip dispensing system comprises the sliding knob 21.<br>
A more detailed description of the cartridge and a feeder mechanism for use therewith is found in<br>
our copending International Patent Application No. PCT/GB02/0207609.9 filed concurrently herewith<br>
(Attorney's ref: P030115WO), which claims priority from USSN 60/280321 filed on 29th March, 2001.<br>
The contents of that PCT application are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference.<br>
Those skilled in the art will recognize that any suitable mechanism may be utilized for<br>
forwarding a test strip into a feeding channel and ensuring that the test strip is entirely dispensed. Once<br>
in the feeding channel, the test strip is positioned to receive a blood sample for analysis. After the<br>
analysis is complete, the user replaces the cartridge cap to re-seal the cartridge, for instance by operation<br>
of the ejection lever 36.<br>
The slidable knob 21 further includes means for arming the drive train of the meter 10.<br>
According to one practice, the knob further operates to switch on the electronics of the meter 10 to<br>
prepare the meter for analysis of a prospective blood sample. According to an alternate embodiment, the<br>
electronics include a strip detector for detecting the presence of<br>
a test strip in the feeding channel. Thus, when the strip detector detects a strip in proximity<br>
to the puncturing site, the electronics switch on.<br>
According to one aspect, the strip dispensing system is designed to ensure that only<br>
one test strip is loaded at a time. The strip dispensing system includes a deviator in co-<br>
operation with the slider. The strip dispensing system allows only one test strip to be<br>
forwarded at a time. After the slidable knob is released and the slider is brought back into<br>
its initial position, the deviator automatically rotates into a position to deflect subsequent<br>
attempts to load an additional test strip into the feeding channel. The release of the<br>
cartridge cap caused by operation of the knob allows the deviator to rotate once the slider<br>
is moved back to its idle position. After forwarding one test strip, the slider route is<br>
deviated inside the cartridge cap, rather than through the test strip cartridge and into the<br>
feeding channel of the meter 10.<br>
When the user presses the cartridge cap closed, the deviator rotates back and resets<br>
the strip dispensing system to dispense a new strip. If a test strip is already loaded into the<br>
feeding channel 20, additional operation of the slidable knob 21 only serves to cock the<br>
lancet assembly and does not load another test strip into the channel. In this manner, the<br>
strip dispensing system allows several cocking and puncturing attempts using the same test<br>
strip. This feature is particularly useful if the lancet is accidentally discharged or if the<br>
puncturing action does not generate a sufficient amount of blood. In this case, the lancet<br>
assembly can be re-cocked without wasting a test strip.<br>
The test strip cartridge 19 and the strip dispensing system co-operate with the<br>
lancet assembly illustrated in Figure 1 to efficiently and less painfully obtain and analyze a<br>
blood sample from a user. As discussed above, operation of the slidable knob 21<br>
simultaneously cocks the lancet assembly and forwards a test strip from the cassette into<br>
the feeding channel 20. The drive train for the lancet assembly may comprise a drive tube,<br>
a lancet holder slidably mounted in the drive tube for holding the lancet 13, a first spring<br>
for urging the lancet holder forward, a second spring for retracting the lancet 13 after the<br>
lancet punctures the skin and a depth adjuster knob 17. The lancet assembly further<br>
includes the cap 16 having an aperture for guiding the lancet 13 through the aperture to the<br>
skin of a user and for shielding the lancet when not in use.<br>
When the slidable knob 21 is operated, the drive tube retracts to arm the lancet<br>
assembly, while simultaneously the test strip is fed through the feeding channel 20 and into<br>
the sample-receiving position shown in Figure 1. The user presses the cap 16 against a<br>
body part, such as a finger or ami, to allow the lancet assembly to drive the lancet tip into<br>
the skin. The lancet assembly subsequently retracts the lancet tip from the skin.<br>
The pressure ring, if present, squeezes the skin to maximize the quantity of blood<br>
formed from a puncture. Once the drop of blood is large enough-, the user moves the meter<br>
so that the sample-receiving area of the strip contacts the blood drop which will be wicked<br>
into the strip. The test strip automatically directs the blood sample to an analysis portion<br>
and the analysis of the blood sample begins automatically.<br>
After the analysis is complete, the user may open the cap 16 and remove the lancet<br>
13 from the lancet holder. The user may then discard the lancet 13, if desired. Those<br>
skilled in the art will recognize that alternate lancet assemblies may be utilized in<br>
accordance with the teachings of the present invention. For example, the present invention<br>
is not limited to the dual-spring drive train of the illustrative embodiment of the invention.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates a test strip design suitable for use in the present invention. The<br>
test strip may utilize OneTouch Ultra (available from LifeScan,Inc. of Milpitas, CA, USA)<br>
technology, membrane strip technology or other test strip designs known in the art for<br>
electrochemical or photometric analysis of a fluid. According to one embodiment, the test<br>
strip includes, as its sample-receiving area, a channel entrance 141 Wbr directing a blood<br>
sample to an analysis portion of the strip. The test strip essentially comprises an<br>
electrochemical cell, including one or more working electrodes 142 which convert a<br>
chemical change, produced by a reaction of glucose or other analyte in the blood sample,<br>
to a current. The test strip further includes a reference electrode 143 as a standard to<br>
measure the potential of the working electrodes. Leads 144 connect the electrodes to<br>
contact bars 145 configured to connect with the electrical contacts of the integrated testing<br>
meter. The test strip thus generates a signal indicative of the level of glucose or other<br>
analyte in the blood and transmits this signal to the electronics of the device for processing.<br>
Those skilled in the art will recognize that a variety of test strip designs and configurations<br>
are available in accordance with the teachings of the present invention.<br>
Figure 6 shows a schematic representation of the electronics incorporated in the<br>
integrated meter of the present invention. The electronics receive a signal from the<br>
electrical contacts, process the signal and transmit instructions for an appropriate display to<br>
the display of the device. As shown, input signals related to the electrochemical analysis<br>
of the sample are provided from the test strip to a signal processing system. The signals<br>
are transmitted via analog circuitry to a processor, which performs data analysis. The<br>
processor provides a signal to a display driver connected to an output display. The<br>
processor may also provide a signal to an alarm generator. The display and the alarm<br>
generator together constitute the output portion of the device. The data analysis processor<br>
also communicates with a memory module, such as an EEPROM, in which information,<br>
including calibration information and previous test results, may be stored.<br>
According to one practice of the invention, the electronics further include a detector<br>
for sensing a strip in the feeding channel. The detector, can be two contacts which are<br>
shorted by a conductive layer on a strip when the strip is in the sample-receiving position.<br>
The electronics may be designed to produce an audible beep or visible signal to indicate to<br>
the user that a sufficient sample has been obtained and that analysis is complete. The<br>
electronics may also read, store and/or display information regarding the date and time of<br>
testing, the condition of die strips, the number of strips remaining in the stack, a calibration<br>
code for the strips, the expiration date of the test strip cartridge, the battery power of the<br>
meter, and so on. As noted above, test strip specific information can.be read directly from<br>
the cartridge, for instance by use of bar codes, resistance bridges or memory modules,<br>
preferably rewritable memory modules.<br>
As discussed, according to one embodiment, the electronics are switched on when a<br>
user slides the knob of the integrated testing meter, or when a test strip detector detects a<br>
test strip loaded in the sample-receiving position. Preferably, each time the electronics are<br>
switched on, the data on the cartridge are read to ensure that the correct calibration code<br>
and other data are used to control the meter. This ensures that a correct test result can be<br>
obtained even if the cartridge has been changed.<br>
According to.another embodiment of the invention, the electronics are switched off<br>
when the user replaces the test strip cartridge cap and ejects the used test strip from the<br>
meter. This provides an extra safety feature as it ensures that the cartridge remains closed<br>
for as long as possible. This minimises the exposure of the contents of the cartridge to the<br>
atmosphere. Preferably, the electronics in the meter are arranged to record the length of<br>
time between a strip reaching the sample-receiving position and its being ejected from the<br>
meter. This is a measure of the time the cap is open. If the total time the cap is open<br>
exceeds a predetermined value, the electronics may be arranged to provide an audible or<br>
visible warning signal. The electronics may also be arranged to provide such a signal, or to<br>
switch off the meter, if any single strip has remained in the sample-receiving position for<br>
longer than a predetermined time.<br>
The integrated meter of the present invention and its components provide<br>
significant improvements to the detection and monitoring of glucose levels in the blood.<br>
The present invention considerably reduces the pain and inconvenience associated with<br>
glucose monitoring. The invention further improves the efficiency and accuracy of testing<br>
by providing an automated transfer and analysis of the sample. The invention provides an<br>
integrated testing meter with user-friendly, uncomplicated operation. The integrated<br>
testing meter is compact, economically sound, discrete and adjustable to different users<br>
and body parts while simultaneously providing fast and accurate results.<br>
The present invention achieves a reduction in the pain associated with testing in a<br>
number of ways. Shallower punctures of the skin can be used to achieve a sufficient blood<br>
sample, reducing painful deep punctures in sensitive body parts. The present invention<br>
does not require large sample volumes for analysis. The pressure device, if used, for<br>
instance formed by the pressure ring on the cap, provides a high yield from a small<br>
puncture. The integrated sampling and testing feature further ensures full usage of the<br>
obtained sample and limits "leftovers" on the skin. In current systems, complex and<br>
inaccurate sample transfer from a sampling point to a sample-receiving area on a test strip<br>
requires surplus sample due to poor utilization of an obtained sample drop. The present<br>
invention decreases this inefficiency of transferring samples and provides optimal<br>
utilization of the obtained sample by easy direction of the sample to a precise location on<br>
the test strip. Optimal utilization of the sample drop reduces the number of attempts<br>
needed to provide enough sample for efficient analysis, thus reducing the number of<br>
punctures required. The superficial punctures reduce agitation of nerve endings in the skin<br>
and reduce pain in sensitive body areas. The variable depth of penetration and the ability<br>
to test on a number of different body parts in addition to the finger reduces the<br>
concentration and repetition of micro-traumata in a small area, which avoids the problems<br>
of tinting, itching, dried and callous skin areas caused by such micro-traumata.<br>
The integrated meter of the present invention is able fully to exploit the<br>
technological improvements in strip design which allow the use of much smaller samples.<br>
Presently available strips require only 1 to 3 fil of sample. The small volume of blood or<br>
other bodily fluid expressed from the user is sufficient to accurately determine or monitor<br>
the presence or absence of an analyte, such as glucose.<br>
The present invention further provides easy and uncomplicated operation. The use<br>
of the meter significantly reduces the time and difficulty involved in sampling and testing<br>
blood. The integrated meter essentially provides three devices, a puncture means, a<br>
supply means, a supply pf test strips and a meter, within a singular compact housing.<br>
Further, the system is designed such that one-handed operation is possible, eliminating<br>
the need for a work space or a flat surface. He meter is not subject to human error and<br>
inefficiency. Furthermore, the integration of a disposable test strip cartridge makes the<br>
loading of a test strip simple, accurate and easy. In current glucose monitoring systems a<br>
user requires two hands to load a strip into a glucose meter. However, with the meter of<br>
the present invention, the test strip dispensing system automatically loads a test strip in<br>
position to receive a blood sample. The present invention also reduced waste by<br>
efficiently utilizing available resources. The present invention further protects against<br>
compromised test results due to contamination or an improperly calibrated glucose meter.<br>
Typically, the re-writable memory is in the format of an EEPROM (electronically<br>
erasable programmable read only memory.) Such a device does not require power to<br>
retain the contents of its memory. Examples of re-writable memory modules according<br>
to the present invention include EEPROM memory chips such as the AT24C01ASC<br>
which is a IK Bits, (128x8 bytes) two wire serial EEPROM available from Atmel<br>
Corporation of San Jose, California USA, in addition to the Fairchild NM93C56M8<br>
which is available from Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation, South Portland, Main,<br>
USA and the Xicor X25020P which is available from Xicor, Inc., Milpitas, CA, USA.<br>
Examples of Flash EPROM memory chips which might be used in the present invention<br>
include the AMD AM29F010-120PC which is available from Advanced Micro Devices,<br>
Sunnyvale, California, USA and the Intel P28F020-150V10 which is available from Intel<br>
Corporation, Folsom, California, USA.<br>
Figure 7, is a further illustration of cartridge 19 wherein re-writable memory<br>
module 118 is physically, fixedly connected to a source of test strips, which, in the<br>
embodiment of the invention illustrated in Figure 7 is strip cartridge 19, to form an<br>
integrated cartridge and memory 119. The source of test strips such as, in this example,<br>
strip cartridge 19 may be<br><br>
referred to as a sensor bank. Thus the sensors in strip cartridge 19 are physically<br>
associated with re-writable memory module 118 and any information contained within it.<br>
Thus, for example, a calibration code written into the re-writable memory module 118 is<br>
uniquely associated with the test strips in that bank and meter 10 can read the calibration<br>
code from re-writable memory module 118 and use that calibration code in converting a<br>
raw test result to a final test result for the test strips stored in cartridge 119. Figure 7<br>
shows in side elevation view a close up of one side of integrated cartridge and memory<br>
119 wherein re-writable memory module 118 located in a matchingly sized recess 118A<br>
on the side of housing 120. Re-writable memory module 118 is typically glued by an<br>
adhesive to the side of cartridge 19.<br>
Figures 8, 9 and 10 illustrate a series of steps, any of which may be optional, as<br>
will be understood by those more skilled in the art, which might be followed on insertion<br>
or connection of an integrate cartridge and memory 119 into a meter 10. It will be<br>
understood by those skilled in the art from the information contained herein that one or<br>
more Hems of information is typically uploaded from the strip bank smart chip into the<br>
meter. Typically this information will be the calibration code, thus rendering the step of<br>
calibrating the meter to a new batch of strips, transparent to a user. If a strip bank is<br>
removed or disconnected from the meter when only some of the strips have been used,<br>
then a useful application of the present invention is downloading of the number of strips<br>
remaining in the strip bank to re-writeable memory module 118. On re-insertion of<br>
cassette 19 number of strips remaining can be uploaded from re-writable memory module<br>
118. Other possibilities include the use of a strip bank in which only some of the strips<br>
are usable. These strips can be located and used if information concerning the location<br>
and type of usable strips is contained within the smart chip. In addition, re-writable<br>
memory module 118 may be used to retain information on the date the cassette was first<br>
opened and/or shelf life expiration information to the meter in determining whether<br>
particular strips should be used or a cassette replaced.<br>
In conclusion, the integrated meter of the present invention significantly reduced<br>
the obstacles associated with frequent glucose monitoring. The present invention<br>
promotes frequent monitoring for diabetic individuals by providing a simple, efficient,<br>
fast and accurate integrated meter.<br>
