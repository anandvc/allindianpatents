THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE NATURE OF THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION <br>
This invention relates to adsorbents for adsorbing deactivated catalyst residues <br>
and other contaminants from a post polyolefin solution polymerization <br>
mixtures. <br><br><br><br>
BACKGROUND <br><br>
Synthesis of polyethylene (PE) in solution polymerization is achieved using <br>
transition metal based catalysts, namely titanium tetrachloride 	(TiC14) and <br>
vanadium oxy trichioride (VOC)3) and co-catalyst such as Triethylaluminium <br>
(TEAL, Al(C2H5)3). During the polymerization process the co-catalyst gets <br>
converted to Al(C2H5)2C1,A1(C2H5)C12 and finally to A1C13. Some by-products <br>
like butene--2, octene-2 are also formed during polymerization due to <br>
isomerization of co-monomers like butane-1 	and octane-1. Deactivation <br>
substances are also added to prevent isomerization. Deactivation of the catalyst is carried out after polymerization to terminate the polymerization reaction and to maximize the polymer product color. Organic fatty acids (C8 - CIO), such as n- nonanoic acid and the like, are used as deactivators. <br>
Deactivated catalyst residues as well as deactivator material are removed by <br>
passing the polymer solution through a fixed adsorbent bed called solution <br>
adsorber loaded with activated alumina at operating conditions of pressure and temperature like 120-150 kg/cm2 and at 220-300 °C. <br>
Activated alumina is used as the adsorbent of choice to remove the catalyst and <br>
co-catalyst residues present in the form of chlorides like TiC13, VOC12IVOC1 <br>
organometallic complexes (catalyst residues) and Al(C2H5)2C1 coming from <br><br><br>
2 <br><br><br><br><br><br>
the unreacted or deactivated catalyst and carboxylic acid from deactivator C8 -<br>
CIO organic fatty acids. <br>
Activated . alumina used for adsorptive removal of catalyst residues <br>
(organometallic complexes) is porous gamma alumina. Activated alumina <br>
performs adsorption both by physisorption as well as chemisorption. Activated <br>
alumina is chosen as the adsorbent, not only because of its porous structure and <br>
high surface area, but also because of the availability of acid and base sites as <br>
Lewis and Bronsted sites on its surface that play an important role in the <br>
removal of deactivated catalyst residues, especially in the case of ethylene <br>
copolymers. <br>
Isomerization of the comonomer butene is another parameter for adsorbent <br>
selection. Lewis acid sites available on the alumina surface are responsible for <br>
isomerization of 1-butene to 2-butene (cis and trans) at high operating <br>
temperature of 280°C. Isomerization is expected to be severe at the start of the <br>
adsorber bed operation and is further impacted by hold up time of the <br>
comonomer with the alumina. Activated alumina is treated with sodium salts <br>
during commercial manufacture to minimize isomerization. Optionally, low <br>
concentration of sodium salts doping up-to 	3 	wt% not only reduces the <br>
isomerization effect but also enhances the color of the polyethylene resin product. <br>
Crush strength of the fresh and spent alumina is an indicative element of the <br>
resistance of the alumina to compaction of the adsorber. Higher the crush <br>
strength better is the ability to withstand the effect of melt index changes of the <br>
polyethylene mixture. Attrition loss is indicative of the amount of alumina that <br>
is expected to be lost by the alumina element rubbing together. Fines resulting <br><br><br><br><br>
3 <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
from attrition tend to create undesirable fish eyes in the polymer as well channeling in the adsorber bed. <br>
Activated alumina adsorbents used for treating polymer solutions for removal of deactivated catalyst residue are associated with problems like formation of dust due to lower crush strength and attrition leading to high pressure drop across the bed ultimately affecting the resulting throughput. Most of the organometallic residues being relatively larger sized complexes are adsorbed only on the surface with the core of the alumina being left unutilized. This phenomenon is compensated by using smaller sized alumina balls which in turn may lead to higher pressure drop across the adsorber on account of lower crush strength and increased attrition. <br>
No remedy to the above problem has been reported in the literature, it is therefore desirable to have an adsorbent having superior adsorption of deactivated catalyst residues. <br>
A composite alumina-zeolite adsorbent is disclosed in United States Patent <br>
3899310 which is claimed to adsorb fatty acid compounds from refrigerant <br>
gases. The composite adsorbent takes up about 30 mg. of fatty acid per gram of <br>
adsorhent, wbJJe alumina rakes up about 2J mg. of fatty acid anti zeoiites about <br>
9 mg. of fatty acid per gram of adsorbent indicating superiority of the disclosed <br>
adsorbent composite over individual components. It is also suggested in the <br>
disclosure that alumina-zeolite composites can be substantially strengthened by <br>
moisture treatment. <br><br>
A method of preparing alumina-based bodies suitable for use as adsorbents or <br>
catalysts is disclosed in US patent	5,935,894	to provide composite bodies<br>
either by spraying or soaking the aqueous solutions containing the alumina<br>
powder and the alkali metals and the soluble carboxylic acid. Thereafter, the <br><br><br>
4 <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
bodies are thermally treated to activate alumina therein and remove or decompose the organic part, e.g., carboxylic acid, of the soluble carboxylic acid alkali metal salt. <br>
US patent no 4762537 discloses the use of an adsorbent comprising zeolite Y <br>
and alumina to remove HCl from hydrogen gas. US pat no 6013600 discloses <br>
the use of alumina with alkali and alkaline earth metals for removing HCl and <br>
other contaminants. Composite solid shaped adsorbents comprising an alumina, <br>
zeolite and metal component for removal of acidic impurities and organic <br>
compounds from ethylene stream are disclosed in US patent no 66632766. <br>
Canadian patent 732279 discloses use of activated alumina for removal of <br>
deactivated catalyst residues from polymerization reaction in a solution <br>
polymerization process. <br>
An object of the present invention is to provide an attrition-resistant, shaped, <br>
solid, composite adsorbent for adsorption of deactivated catalyst residues and <br>
deactivation materials from polyolefin in the solution polymerization <br>
technology under critical process conditions of temperature and pressure. <br>
A related object of the invention is, therefore, also to provide a method for producing said composite adsorbent with additional properties like porosity &amp; lower surface reactivity. <br><br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION <br><br>
Composite adsorbent envisaged in the present invention comprises a solid <br>
shaped adsorbent and a process for preparing the adsorbent. A starting material <br>
for making the composite adsorbent are alumina powder having the average <br>
particle size of about 60 to 80 microns. Activated alumina powder is preferably <br>
obtained by rapid dehydration of aluminum hydroxide like alumina trihydrate <br>
in a stream of hot gas in the temperature range of 350-1000°C in a suitable <br>
apparatus. The duration of contact between alumina tri-hydrate and the hot gas <br>
is for less than a minute which may last from a fraction of second to several <br>
seconds, the preferred contact time being 3- 6 seconds. Method of such rapid <br>
activation is well known in art and the process is commonly referred to as flash <br><br><br><br>
8 <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
calcination. The alumina once activated is an amorphous transition alumina <br>
and is grounded to 1-20 microns more preferably about 4-10 microns of <br>
average particle size after rapid activation. Any grinding technique known to those skilled in art may be used. Activated alumina has LOI of about 5-8 wt% in the temperature range of 250-1000°C with 6-7 wt% being typical. <br>
The other necessary starting material for the present invention is clay selected <br>
from Kaolinite group of clay minerals having average particle size of 40-60 <br>
microns. Kaolinite clay is de-agglomerated into particles having an average <br>
size of about 4-10 microns more preferably 
powder and Kaoline clay are ground and mixed together and further ground to <br>
form dry powder blends in different ratios ranging from 70 -90 wt% of <br>
activated alumina powder and balance clay to form a homogenous powder <br>
mixture blend. These materials are mixed together and ground to an average <br>
particle size of 5-10 microns. Any grinding technique known to those skilled in <br>
the art may be used. The homogeneous mixture is essential to form uniform <br>
shapes like spheres or extrudates. In a particularly preferred embodiment about <br>
70 wt% of activated alumina powder and about 30 wt% of clay are mixed <br>
together and are formed into shaped articles like extrudates or spheres with <br>
addition of water to the dry blend. Preferred method of forming of spheres <br>
involves use of a pan nodulizer and is well known to those skilled in art. The <br>
formed shaped balls or spheres are cured by heating at 90-130°C for about 12-<br>
24 hrs in a humid atmosphere. This curing is conducted in a closed container so <br>
that the prepared composites are in self generated steam. Curing of shaped <br>
bodies by this method produces composites having a high dry and wet strength without affecting the adsorptive properties of the composite adsorbent.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
9<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Post curing prepared composite adsorbent formed bodies are dried to a water <br>
content of less than about 15 wt% and this is accomplished by heating the <br>
composites to about 100-125°C in an open atmosphere for about 2-48 hrs. <br>
Further dried composites are activated by heating to 150 to 650°C for about I <br>
to 5 hrs and closely held water molecules within the alumina and kaolin clay <br>
mixture are removed making the prepared composite adsorbent suitable for <br>
impregnating with alkali metal salts. The prepared composite adsorbents are <br>
strong enough to be used as commercially useful adsorbents. The composite adsorbents prepared will be useful if they have a high adsorption capacity for deactivated catalyst residues and are also strong when in a dry state. <br>
A particularly preferred spherical agglomerated composite adsorbent having 8-<br>
10 mesh size (Tyler series) has about 270 m2/ g surface area, 0.47 cc/g total <br>
pore volume, LOI of 2.8 wt% at 280-1000°C, crush strength about 5.5 kgf and <br>
bulk density of about 0.80 gm/cc of formed composites spheres. The <br>
agglomerated composite spheres have almost zero attrition compared to <br>
activated alumina, which is an important parameter required for a <br>
polymerization mixture purification adsorbent in a solution polymerization <br>
adsorber. Deactivated organometallic chloride catalyst residues and free <br>
hydrochloric acid attack the activated alumina which results in deterioration of <br>
the prior art activated alumina agglomeres like dust formation and sintering <br>
which is undesirable. <br>
The formed composite agglomerated spheres are used as a support for doping <br>
with alkali salts. The shaped composite agglomerated spheres are further <br>
treated with an alkaline metal solution selected from the group consisting of <br>
alkali metals. Metal solutions can include salts of sodium, potassium and <br>
lithium. The choice of the metal solution depends on its decomposition to <br><br><br>
10 <br><br><br><br><br><br>
metal oxides at activation conditions. Specific examples of these metal solution <br>
included sodium chloride, sodium acetate, sodium hydroxide or mixtures <br>
thereof, while other potassium and lithium salts can also be used. Formed <br>
composite adsorbent supports are doped in the solutions of metal solutions with <br>
varying compositions of alkali metal salt solution and water. Solutions of the <br>
desired metal compounds are prepared in an aqueous medium having pH <br>
variation from 7 to 14. The prepared metal solutions are used as such without <br>
pH adjustment further. <br>
In one method alumina clay composite agglomerated spheres and activated <br>
alumina balls are doped in an aqueous solution of the desired metal compound <br>
	for 1-4 hrs. Doped composite agglomerated and activated alumina balls are  <br>
further air dried for 1-24 hrs in an open atmosphere. The amount of metal <br>
solution varies considerably but must be preseilt in 0.5 to 5 wt% on the <br>
prepared composites. <br>
In accordance with another method of forming the composite adsorbent, the <br>
alumina, kaolin clay and an aqueous solution of the desired metal compound <br>
are mixed together and formed into a shaped article such as cylindrical pellets <br>
of 1/8" or 1/16" size or tablets or spheres by methods well known in art. <br>
Drying of doped composites is achieved in batches like in bins or trays or in a <br>
continuous process using a moving belt. The dried composite adsorbent is <br>
further oven dried in the temperature range of 100_180°C and finally activated <br>
at 500-600°C under air atmosphere for a time period of 1/2hr to 4 hrs. The <br>
activation can be done in trays in a furnace with continuous air flow enough to <br>
carry away moisture released from air dried composites. The surface area of <br>
metal compounds doped activated alumina and composite adsorbents is <br>
reduced to &gt; 200 m2/gm and &gt;140 m2/gm and pore volume 0.34cc/gm and <br><br><br>
11 <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
0.32 cc/gm respectively. A comparison of physiochemical properties for the <br>
adsorbent of the invention and prior art activated alumina sodium doped <br>
adsorbent is compiled in Table-1 indicating that the composite adsorbent has <br>
significantly better physical properties compared to activated alumina alone. <br>

The present invention also envisages a method of producing adsorbents with a <br>
high macroporosity and to their use for adsorption of catalyst residues from <br>
polymerization mixture of solution polymerization. The term "macroporosity" <br>
should be understood to mean, in accordance with the IUPAC data, a pore <br>
having a diameter greater than 100 A. Fig 1 of the accompanying drawings <br>
shows mercury porosimetry data indicating the composite adsorbent of this <br>
invention has higher macroporosity compared to activated alumina. More <br>
specifically, the present invention relates to a macroporous adsorbent <br>
comprising pores having a 69 % pore volume in the composite adsorbent and<br><br><br><br>
12<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
activated alumina having 47% pore volume arising from &gt;	100	A° pore<br>
diameter. The macroporous composite adsorbents have higher catalyst residue <br>
adsorption from the polymerization mixture compared to activated alumina. <br>
The water adsorption capacity of the composite adsorbent is 
saturation vapor pressure as shown in figure 2 of the accompanying drawings. <br>
Clay by itself is not known as a sorbent for the adsorbate (i.e. catalyst residue of the composition), though it is known to impart certain mechanical property enhancement to materials where it is incorporated. Yet, however the overall macroporosity and resultant adsorptive efficacy of the present composition has increased due to incorporation of clay, which showcases a synergistic property enhancement in the combination of silica and clay. <br>
The description of the invention is now further illustrated by the following examples. It is to be understood that the examples are only by way of illustration and are not intend as an undue limitation on the wide scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. <br><br><br><br>
Example 1 <br>
Composite adsorbent spherical balls were prepared containing alumina powder <br>
and kaolin clay in a rotating pan device. Spherical beads were continuously <br>
formed by simultaneously adding active alumina and kaolin clay blended with <br>
spraying water. The spherical balls which had particle size distribution from 8-<br>
12 Tyler mesh were cured at 90-100°C for three hours in a closed container. <br>
The cured beads were air dried in a oven at 	130°C for 6 hrs followed by <br>
calcination at 600°C for 4 hrs under air flow. The calcined beads were cooled <br>
and doped in the aqueous solution of an acetate. The doping was achieved by <br><br><br><br>
13 <br><br><br><br><br><br>
keeping the calcined beads in the aqueous solution of I gm of sodium acetate <br>
in 100 gm of adsorbent in a rotating pan device. The sample was air dried for <br>
12hrs followed by oven drying at 150°C for 12 hrs. Finally dried doped beads <br>
were activated at 450°C for 4 hrs under air flow. Sodium content on the beads <br>
on the volatile free basis was about 0.90 wt% . Prior art activated alumina balls <br>
of similar size range were doped with sodium acetate to and dried and activated <br>
under identical conditions as composite adsorbent to achieve 0.85 wt% sodium <br>
content on volatile free basis. <br><br><br><br>
Example 2 <br><br>
The procedure set forth in example 1 was used to dope prepared balls except <br>
that solution containing 2 wt% of sodium acetate was used to dope the 100 <br>
gm of composite adsorbent balls to achieve sodium content on thus prepared <br>
beads on volatile free basis was about 2.1 wt%. Similarly 100 gm of activated <br>
prior art alumina balls were also doped with sodium acetate under identical <br>
conditions as composite adsorbent to achieve 2.5 - wt% sodium content on <br>
volatile free basis. <br><br><br><br>
Example 3 <br>
The procedure set forth in example 1 was used to dope prepared balls except <br>
that solution containing 3 wt% of sodium acetate was used to dope the 100 <br>
gm of composite adsorbent balls to achieve sodium content on the prepared <br>
beads on volatile free basis was about 3.4 wt%. Similarly 100 gin of prior art <br>
activated alumina balls were also doped with sodium acetate under identical <br><br><br><br><br>
14 <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
conditions as composite adsorbent balls to achieve	3.1	wt% sodium content on<br>
volatile free basis. <br><br><br><br>
Example 4 <br>
The sodium doped composite adsorbent and prior art alumina as prepared in <br>
example 1-3 were tested for organometallic catalyst residue pick in a fixed <br>
polyethylene melt purification solution adsorber of commercial solution <br>
polymerization unit during linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) <br>
manufacture. The sodium doped composite adsorbent and activated alumina <br>
balls samples of 250 gm each was placed in meshed metal cages at the inlet of <br>
a melt purification adsorber for 48 hrs. The mesh size was enough for the free <br>
flow of melt adsorber at 280°C and 140 bar pressure. Samples were taken out <br>
during unloading of the adsorber and analyzed for oragnometallic residues <br>
adsorbed by samples. The samples were analyzed for Ti and V adsorption by <br>
ICP elemental analysis. The results are presented in tables 2A &amp; 2B and show <br>
that the composite adsorbent has adsorbed higher amount of Titanium and <br>
Vanadium catalyst residues compared to activated alumina. Total chloride <br>
adsorbed on the composite and activated alumina are given in table 3 and <br>
shows that composite adsorbent adsorbed considerably higher amount of total <br>
chlorides as determined by the turbidity method. Similarly figures 3 and 4 <br>
shows higher adsorption of titanium and vanadium on the composite adsorbent <br>
compared to activated alumina wherein surface sensitive EDXA 	(Energy <br>
Dispersive X-ray Analysis) and ESCA 	(Electron Spectroscopy Chemical <br>
analysis) techniques were used for comparison. In figure 3 and 4, titanium and <br>
vanadium catalyst residues on adsorbent surface are compared for activated <br><br><br><br><br>
15 <br><br><br><br><br><br>
alumina and composite adsorbent which shows higher pickup of residues on composite adsorbent. <br><br><br>

Further Examples: <br>
The procedure set forth in example 1 was used to dope the prepared balls with <br>
solutions containing chlorides, hydroxides, and carbonates of alkali metals <br>
such as sodium, potassium and lithium (NaCl, NaOH, Na2CO3, KCI, K2CO3, <br>
KOH and Li2CO3, LiCI and LiOH) in different wt % and it was found that the <br><br>
16 <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
doping was satisfactory and their activity for adsorption of the residues were <br>
also roughly similar to the results obtained for the doping as per examples 1, 2 <br>
and 3. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
