				<td>Biomaterial<br>
The present invention relates to the field of synthetic bone, dental materials and regeneration scaffolds for biomedical applications and, in particular, to synthetic bone, dental materials and regeneration scaffolds and their precursors comprising collagen, a calcium phosphate material and one or more glycosaminoglycans.<br>
Natural bone is a biocomposite of collagen, non-collagenous organic phases including glycosaminoglycans, and calcium phosphate.  Its complex hierarchical structure leads to exceptional mechanical properties including high stiffness, strength, and fracture toughness, which in turn enable bones to withstand the physiological stresses to which they are subjected on a daily basis.  The challenge faced by researchers in the field is to make a synthetic material that has a composition and structure that will allow natural bone growth in and around the synthetic material in the human or animal body.<br>
It has been observed that bone will bond directly to calcium phosphates in the human body (a property referred to as bioactivity) through a bone-like apatite layer formed in the body environment.  Collagen and copolymers comprising collagen and other bioorganics such as glycosaminoglycans on the other hand, are known to be optimal substrates for the attachment and proliferation of numerous cell types, including those responsible for the production and maintenance of bone in the human body.<br>
Hydroxyapatite is the calcium phosphate most commonly used as constituent in bone substitute materials.  It is, however, a relatively insoluble material when compared to other forms of calcium phosphate materials such as brushite, tricalcium phosphate and octacalcium phosphate.  The relatively low solubility of apatite can be a disadvantage when producing a biomaterial as the rate of resorption of the material in the body is particularly slow.<br>
Calcium phosphates such as hydroxyapatite are mechanically stiff materials. However, they are relatively brittle when compared to natural bone.  Collagen is a mechanically tough material, but has relatively low stiffness when compared to natural bone.  Materials comprising copolymers of collagen and glycosaminoglycans are both tougher and stiffer than collagen alone, but still have relatively low stiffness when compared to natural bone."<br>
Previous attempts in the prior art of producing a synthetic bone-substitute material having improved mechanical toughness over hydroxyapatite and improved stiffness over collagen and copolymers of collagen and glycosaminoglycans include combining collagen and apatite by mechanical mixing.  Such a mechanical method is described in EP-A-0164 484.<br>
Later developments in the technology include producing a bone-replacement material comprising hydroxyapatite, collagen and chondroitin-4-sulphate by the mechanical mixing of these components.  This is described in EP-A-0214070. This document further describes dehydrothermic crosslinking of the chondroitin-4-sulphate to the collagen.  Materials<br>
comprising apatite, collagen and chondroitin-4-sulphate have been found to have good biocompatibility.  The mechanical mixing of the apatite with the collagen, and optionally chondroitin-4-sulphate, essentially forms collagen / chondroitin-4-sulphate-coated particles of apatite.  It has been found that such a material, although biocompatible, produces limited in-growth of natural bone when in the human or animal body and no remodeling of the calcium phosphate phase of the synthetic material.<br>
The present invention seeks to address at least some of the problems associated with the prior art.<br>
In a first aspect, the present invention provides a process for the production of a composite material comprising collagen, brushite and one or more glycosaminoglycans, said process comprising the steps of<br>

The term triple co-precipitate encompasses precipitation of the three compounds where the compounds have been precipitated at substantially the same time from the same solution/dispersion.  It is to be distinguished from a material formed from the mechanical mixing of the components, particularly where these components have been precipitated separately, for instance in different solutions.  The microstructure of a co-precipitate is<br>

either allowing the solution to stand until precipitation occurs, agitating the solution, titration using basic titrants such as ammonia, addition of a nucleating agent such as pre-fabricated brushite, varying the rate of addition of the calcium source, and any combination of these techniques.<br>
In a second aspect, the present invention provides a process for the production of a composite biomaterial comprising collagen, octacalcium phosphate and one or more glycosaminoglycans, said process comprising the steps of<br>
providing a composite material comprising collagen, brushite and one or more glycosaminoglycans, and<br>
converting at least some of the brushite in the composite material to octacalcium phosphate by hydrolysation.<br>
The term biomaterial encompasses a material that is biocompatible with a human or animal body.<br>
In the second aspect, the composite material preferably comprises or consists essentially of a triple co-precipitate comprising collagen, brushite and one or more glycosaminoglycans.  The triple co-precipitate may be formed by a process as herein described in relation to the first aspect of the present invention.<br>
Preferably, the step of hydrolysation (hydrolysis) of brushite to octacalcium phosphate comprises contacting the triple co-precipitate with an aqueous solution, said aqueous solution being at or above the pH at which octacalcium phosphate becomes thermodynamically more stable than<br>

converting at least some of the brushite in the composite material to apatite by hydrolysation.  i<br>
Apatite is a class of minerals comprising calcium and phosphate and has the general formula: Cas(P04) 3(X), wherein<br>
X may be an ion that is typically OH", F~ and Cl~, as well as other ions known to those skilled in the art.  Apatite also includes substituted apatites such as silicon-substituted apatites.  Apatite includes hydroxyapatite, which is a specific example of an apatite.  The hydroxyapatite may also be substituted with silicon.<br>
In the third aspect, the composite material preferably comprises or consists essentially of a triple co-precipitate comprising collagen, brushite and one or more glycosaminoglycans.  T,he triple co-precipitate may be formed according to the process as herein described in relation to the first aspect of the present invention.<br>
Preferably, the step of hydrolysation (hydrolysis) of brushite to apatite comprises contacting the triple co-precipitate with an aqueous solution, said aqueous solution being at or above the pH at which apatite becomes thermodynamically more stable than brushite.  Preferably, for the conversion of brushite to apatite, the aqueous solution has a pH of from 6.65 to 9, more preferably from 7 to 8.5, still more preferably from 7.2 to 8.5.  The aqueous solution may comprise, for example, deionised water whose pH is controlled with a titrant, a buffer solution, a solution saturated with respect to another calcium-containing compound and/or phosphorus-containing compound.<br>
Preferably, the step of hydrolysation of brushite to apatite is performed at a temperature of 20 to 50°C, more preferably from 30 to 40°C7 still more preferably from 36 to 38 °C, most preferably around 37 °C.<br>
Preferably, the step of hydrolysation of brushite to apatite is performed for a time of from 12 to 288 hours, more preferably from 18 to 72 hours, most preferably from 24 to 48 hours.<br>
Methods of increasing the rate of conversion of brushite to octacalcium phosphate and/or apatite include (i) increasing the temperature, (ii) the brushite concentration in solution, and/or (iii) the agitation speed.<br>
It may be desirable to produce a biomaterial according to the present invention comprising both apatite and octacalcium phosphate. The processes of the second and third aspects of the present invention may be combined to produce a material comprising both octacalcium phosphate and apatite.  The brushite in the triple co-precipitate may first be converted to octacalcium phosphate and then the octacalcium phosphate may be partially converted to apatite. Total, or near total (i.e. at least 98%), conversion of brushite or octacalcium phosphate to apatite typically occurs by hydrolysation at a pH of 8.0 or more for a period of about 12 hours.  Partial conversion of the brushite and/or apatite in the material may therefore be effected by hydrolysation for a period of less than 12 hours.<br>
Preferably, the step of hydrolysation of octacalcium phosphate to apatite is carried out at a pH of from 6.65 to 10, more preferably from 7.2 to 10, still more preferably from 8 to 9.<br>
Preferably, the step of hydrolysation of octacalcium phosphate to apatite is performed at a temperature of from<br>
20 to 50°C, more preferably from 30 to 40°C, still more preferably from 36 to 38°C, most preferably around 37°C.<br>
Preferably, the step of hydrolysation of octacalcium phosphate to apatite is performed for a time of from 2 to 144 hours, more preferably from 12 to 96 hours, most preferably from 24 to 72 hours.<br>
In the second and third aspects of the present, invention, the conversion of brushite to octacalcium phosphate and/or apatite is preferably conducted at a temperature of from 30 to 40 degrees centigrade.  More preferably, the conversion is conducted at a temperature of from 36 to 38 degrees centigrade.  Most preferably, the conversion is conducted at a temperature of about 37 degrees centigrade.<br>
Preferably, the processes of the present invention further comprise the step of crosslinking the one or more glycosaminoglycans and the collagen in the triple co-precipitate.  By triple co-precipitate this includes the triple co-precipitate comprising collagen, brushite and one or more glycosaminoglycans and derivatives of the co-precipitate.  Derivatives include the co-precipitate wherein at least some of the brushite has been converted to octacalcium phosphate and/or apatite, and the co-precipitate that has been shaped or moulded, or subjected to any further chemical or mechanical processing.  Crosslinking may be achieved using any of the conventional techniques.<br>
Preferably, at least some of the brushite is converted to octacalcium phosphate and/or apatite, the<br>
glycosaminoglycan and collagen are crosslinked prior to the conversion of .the brushite to octacalcium phosphate and/or apatite.  This crosslinking may be effected by subjecting the triple co-precipitate to one or more of gamma radiation, ultraviolet radiation, a dehyrdothermal treatment/ non-enzymatic glycation with a simple sugar such as glucose, mannose, ribose and sucrose, contacting the triple co-precipitate with one or more of glutaraldehyde, ethyl dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide and/or nor-dihydroguariaretic acid, or any combination of these methods.  These methods are conventional in the art.<br>
Preferably, if at least some of the brushite is converted to octacalcium phosphate and/or apatite, the glycosaminoglycan and collagen are crosslinked subsequent to the conversion of the brushite to octacalcium phosphate and/or apatite.  The crosslinking subsequent to the conversion of the brushite to apatite/octacalcium phosphate may be effected by one or more of the methods mentioned above or a dehydrothermal treatment, or any combination of these methods.  A dehydrothermal treatment includes subjecting a substrate to a low pressure atmosphere at a raised temperature.  The temperature in the dehydrothermal treatment may be of from 95°C to 135°C. The temperature may preferably be of from 100°C to 110°C, and most preferably of from 105°C to 110°C, if completion of the dehydrothermal treatment is desired in typically 18 to 36 hours.  The temperature may preferably be of from 120°C to 135°C, and most preferably of from 125°C to 135°C, if completion of the dehydrothermal treatment is desired in typically 4 to 8 hours.<br>
Preferably, the collagen and the glycosaminoglycan are crosslinked both prior to and subsequent to conversion of the brushite to octacalcium phosphate and/or apatite.<br>
The processes of the present invention may comprise the step of shaping the composite biomaterial into a structure suitable for use as a bone or dental substitute.  Such a step may occur after formation of the triple co-precipitate, but prior to any conversion of the brushite or crosslinking of the collagen and glycosaminoglycan that may occur.<br>
Alternatively, the step of shaping the biomaterial may occur subsequent to either the conversion of the brushite to apatite and/or octacalcium phosphate or crosslinking of the collagen and the glycosaminoglycan.<br>
Preferably, the composite material is shaped using a technique selected from (i) filtration and/or low temperature drying, (ii) freeze drying, (iii) injection moulding and (iv) cold pressing.  Filtration and/or low temperature drying, wherein the temperature is from 15°C to 40°C, most preferably of from 35°C to 40°C/  typically results in a dense granular form of material.  Freeze drying typically results in an open porous form.  Injection moulding results in a wide variety of shapes/morphologies of a material depending on the shape of the dye used.  Cold pressing typically results in a dense pellet form.<br>
The present invention further provides a precursor material suitable for transforming into a synthetic biomaterial, said precursor material comprising a composite material comprising collagen, brushite and one or more<br>
glycosaminoglycans.  Preferably, the composite material comprises or consists essentially of a triple co-precipitate comprising collagen, brushite and one or more glycosaminoglycans.  The triple co-precipitate may be produced according to the process of the first aspect of the present invention.<br>

Alternatively, the biomaterial may comprise a mixture of octacalcium phosphate and apatite, depending on the desired properties, of the biomaterial.<br>
The material of the present invention comprising brushite may be used either as a precursor material for making a biomaterial, or may be suitable in itself for use as a biomaterial.<br>
The processes according to the present invention may be preformed using the following sequential method, which may be applied in whole or in part, to produce biocomposites of collagen, one or more glycosaminoglycan and one or more calcium phosphate constituents.  The following description is provided by way of example and is applicable to any aspect of the processes according to the present invention.<br>
I:   Triple Co-precipitation of Collagen, GAG, and the Calcium Phosphate Brushite at Acidic pH<br>
This step is performed to initiate simultaneous formation, via precipitation from solution, of the three (or more) constituents of the composite, and to control the ratio of the three (or more) respective phases.  Control of<br>
the compositional properties of the composite (and in particular the collagen:GAG:CaP ratio) may be achieved by varying one or more of the pH, temperature, ageing time, calcium ion concentration, phosphorous ion concentration, collagen concentration and GAG concentration.  The pH may be maintained constant (using, for example, buffers, pH-stat titration or other methods) or be allowed to vary.  The possible secondary (contaminant) phases include other acidic calcium phosphates (e.g. monetite, calcium hydrogen phosphate) and complexes including by-products of titration and reactant addition.(e.g. ammonium phosphate, ammonium nitrate).  Additives to aid crosslinking (e.g. glucose, ribose) or to enhance in-vivo response (e.g. growth factors, gene transcription factors, silicon, natriuretic peptides) may also be added during this step.<br>
II:  Net Shape Formation<br>
This step may be performed to produce the desired architecture of the final composite form, with particular emphasis on control of pore architecture.  Examples of techniques include filtration and low-temperature drying (resulting in a dense granular form), freeze drying (resulting in an open porous form), injection moulding (resulting in a wide range of shapes depending on the type of dye) and cold pressing (resulting in a dense pellet form).<br>
Ill: Primary Crosslinking<br>
This step may be performed to preferably ensure that, when placed in a solution of.elevated pH, the GAG content of<br>
the composite does not elude rapidly, and, furthermore, to enhance the mechanical and degradation properties of the composite.  Examples of techniques include low-temperature physical techniques (e.g. gamma irradiation, ultraviolet radiation, dehydrothermal treatment), chemical techniques (e.g. non-ensymatic glycation with a simple sugar, glutaraldehyde, ethyl dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide, nordihydroguariaretic acid), or combination methods (e.g. simultaneous non-enzymatic glycation and gamma-irradiation). In the event that conversion to octacalcium phosphate (i.e. as in step IV) is desirable, primary crosslinking is advantageously performed at a temperature below about 37°C to prevent conversion of the brushite phase to its dehydrated form, monetite, which is a calcium phosphate that does not readily hydrolyse to octacalcium phosphate.<br>
IV:  Hydrolysis<br>
This step may be performed to partially or fully hydrolyse the CaP phase from brushite (phase with high solubility at physiological pH) to octacalcium phosphate and/or apatite (phases with lower solubility at , physiological pH}, and to substantially remove any soluble contaminant phases (e.g. ammonium nitrate, calcium hydrogen phosphate).  In the case of hydrolysis to OCP, the selected pH is advantageously maintained constant at about 6.65 (using a buffer, pH stat, or other method), and the temperature at about 37 °C for around 24-48 hours.  As was the case in Step I, additives to aid in crosslinking (e.g. glucose, ribose) or to enhance in-vivo response (e.g. growth factors, gene transcription factors, silicon, natriuretic<br>
peptides) may also be added during the hydrolysis step (Step IV).<br>
V:   Secondary .Crosslinking<br>
This step may be performed to further tailor the mechanical and degradation properties of the composite.  Any or all of the crosslinking procedures listed in Step III above may be used to effect secondary crosslinking..<br>
The following Examples and the accompanying Figures are provided to further assist in the understanding the present invention.  The Examples and Figures are not to be considered limiting to the scope of the invention.  Any feature described in the Examples or Figures is applicable to any aspect of the foregoing description.<br>
Example 1<br>
Example 1 is an example of the synthesis method described above, executed via application of steps I through III only. Triple co-precipitation is carried out at room temperature (20-25°C), at a pH of about 3.2 (maintained by titration with ammonia).  In this example, co-precipitates are dried at 37°C and crosslinked via a dehydrothermal treatment.  Neither hydrolytic conversion of the CaP nor secondary crosslinking is performed in this example.<br>

ensure that it remains in the range 3.15<ph the></ph>
resulting slurry is then allowed to age for 24 hours at room<br>
temperature.<br>
Step II<br>
-	The slurry is allowed to dry at 37°C in air for 5 days,<br>
and the remaining triple co-precipitate rinsed with<br>
deionised water, and subsequently dried again at 37°C for an<br>
additional 24 hours.<br>

Example 2 is an example of the synthesis method described above, executed via application of steps I through IV only.  Triple co-precipitation is carried out at room temperature, and a pH of 4.0.  In this example, pH control is effected by careful control of the calcium hydroxide and calcium nitrate concentrations - an approach that also enables control of the mass ratio of brushite to collagen<br>
plus GAG in the triple coprecipitate.  The resulting triple co-precipitates are then frozen to -20°C, placed under vacuum and then heated to induce sublimation of unbound water (i.e. ice).  Primary crosslinking is performed using a 1-ethyl 3-(3-dimethyl aininopropyl} carbodiimide treatment. The resulting dried triple coprecipitate is then converted to octacalcium phosphate via hydrolysis at a pH of 6.67 at about 37°C.  In 'this example, secondary crosslinking is not performed.<br>
