METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR-DESTROYING MICROBIAL CONTAMINATION OF MAIL AND. PAPER CURRENCY<br>
STERIS INC. of 43425 BUSINESS PARK DRIVE,  TEMECULA, CA 92590, U.S.A., AMERICAN Company<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br>
GRANTED<br>
5-1-2005<br><br>
Background of the  Investtion<br>
The present application relates to "the destruction of microbes on relatively thin paper or plastic carriers. It finds particular application in conjunction with killing Anthrax spores and other biological contaminants in mail and will be described with particular reference thereto. Tt will also find application in the treatment of other thin items such as bank notes, tickets, checks$   receipts, and the like.<br>
Biological terrorism through the mails has become a serious problem. Recent events have shown the ease with which biotexrorists can deliver Anthrax and other biological weapons to targets using the postal system.<br>
There are numerous known decontaminating systems. These Include radiation, x-rays, e- beams, and ultraviolet light, plasma methods on the basis of etching with glow discharge, gas decontamination, and ozone decontamination.<br>
High energy electron beams are ill-suited for destroying microbes in the mail. High-energy electrons, with a kinetic energy in the range of 5-10 MeV use large electron accelerators and need relatively large radiation shields for safety. Moreover, these systems are very expensive and need-specialized staff to operate them Further, the electron beam delivers a very high Joule? energy over a limited penetration<br><br><br>
range. This energy leads to heating not only of the microbes, but also the surrounding envelopes. This can lead to overheating of the envelopes and other paper in the mail, possibly causing combustion. This heating can also soften plastic materials in the mail leading to its deformation and thermal bonding with surrounding materials. Heat can also destroy security characteristics of bank notes.<br>
FR 2773715 discloses sterilization of exterior surfaces of packaging with a pulsed beam of electrons of energy 100-500 keV. US 5,496,302 disclose sterilizing containers for medical liquids with a pulsed electron beam.<br>
Gamma radiation, due to its greater penetrating power, is more amenable to bulk decontamination of mail. However, this same increased penetrating power increases the necessary shielding. Typically, very thick containment rooms are needed. When radioisotopes are used as the radiation source, heavy water containment tanks are needed and depleted radioactive waste issues arise. X-rays generated through x-ray vacuum tubes are highly energy consumptive, generate large amounts of waste heat, and have similar shielding problems to gamma radiation.<br>
Plasma radiation methods are effective for killing microbes in the air and on surfaces. However, plasma discharge is not amenable to killing microbes inside of envelopes.<br>
Ozone and other toxic gas methods , are effective for killing microbes. However, obtaining penetration into envelopes or other paper products is slow. For toxic gases, further time is needed to evacuate the toxic gas back out of the interior of the envelopes at the end of the process. Also, strong oxidants, such as ozone, may alter some inks and dyes in any printing on or in the envelopes.<br>
The present application provides a new and improved irradiation system that overcomes the above-referenced problems and others.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, an apparatus is provided for microbially decontaminating flat objects including bank notes. A cash storage box stores the bank notes. A dispenser or receiver means dispenses or receives bank notes. A conveyor means moves the flat objects individually through a treatment chamber between the cash storage box and the dispenser or receiver means. A radiation means generates radiation while each flat object is in the treatment chamber. The radiation means includes an election beam source of up to 500 keV which generates pulses of electrons. A sensor means senses each flat object<br><br><br>
entering the chamber. A trigger circuit means triggers the radiation means to irradiate each flat object as it passes through the treatment chamber.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a notes of decontaminating flat objects, including bank notes potentially containing microbial contamination is provided. Individual flat objects pass along a conveying path between a cash box and a bank note port through a treatment region. Radiation is generated including electron beam pulses of up to 500 keV. Each flat object entering the treatment region is sensed and irradiation of each flat object with a burst of radiation is triggered as it passes through the treatment region.<br>
One advantage of the present application resides in its capability to deactivate microbial contamination such as, but not limited to, bacteria, viruses and spores on paper currency without damaging the currency itself or the security aspects of the paper currency.<br>
One advantage of the present invention resides in its efficiency of destruction of spores (using radiation and thermal sterilization),<br>
One advantage of the present invention resides in its safely relative to security signs for paper currency and other security documents.<br>
One advantage of the present invention resides in its speed.<br>
Another advantage of the present invention resides in its low shielding requirements.<br>
Another advantage of the present invention resides in its high operator safety.<br>
Another advantage of the present invention resides in its modest cost and simplicity of operation.<br>
Still further advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art upon reading and understanding the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
The invention may take form in various components and arrangements of components, and in various steps and arrangements  of  steps. The drawings are only for purposes of<br><br><br>
illustrating a preferred embodiment Bad. are not to be construed. as limiting "the invention.<br>
FIGURE la is a diagrammatic illustration of a mail or other flat object decontaminating system;<br>
FIGURE lb is illustrative of the Irradiation of spores in an envelope;<br>
FIGURE 2a is a diagrammatic illustration of a more detailed system for irradiating mail or other flat objects in accordance with the present invention;<br>
FIGURE 2b is an alternate embodiment of the system, of FIGURE 2&amp;;   and,<br>
FIGURE 2c is another alternate embodiment of the system of FIGURE 2a.<br><br>
Broadly stated, an apparatus and method are provided that capable of destroying microbial contamination on both mail and paper currency. As used herein, microbial contamination, shall refer to bacteria, viruses, spores, pathogenic biological material and other biological material capable of deactivation by radiative means,<br><br>
With reference to FIGURE la, an apparatus 10 receives a rapid supply of flat objects 12, such as individual envelopes, lelters, or mail traveling longitudinally at high speed substantially end-to-end. As an envelope enters a port 14, it is identified and the power supply is actuated such that when a conveyor 16 conveys the envelope 12 into a treatment chamber 18, it is irradiated under near adiabatic conditions. Energy from the radiation is absorbed by ionization and collision with atoms and molecules of microbial contamination 20 on and in the envelope leading to its deactivation. it is believed in one instance that in the case of microbes, the impact energy of the beam damages the microbe's DNA on a genetic level. It is further believed that thermal energy produced within the microbes  resulting  from the  irradiation  of  the.  microbes<br>
deactivates the microbes.  After being treated, the envelopes move to further processing stations or a storage box 22.<br>
As illusCrated in FIGURE lb, the envelopes 12 hold the Anthrax spores and other microbial contamination 20 against movement. In other paper products, microbes are analogously held in pores of the paper. It is believed in one instance that a pulsed energy beam 24 alters the genetic codes of the stationary microbes, thus deactivating the microbes, without destroying the envelope and other surrounding materials. In another instance, it is believed that thermal energy absorbed by the microbes as a result of the irradiation deactivates the microbes.<br>
With reference to FIGURE 2a, when an envelope 12 enters the input port 14, a sensor 26 sends a signal to a trigger signal generator 28. The trigger signal generator-triggers a pulse of a pulsed high voltage generator 30 to output one or more voltage pulses, The pulsed high 'voltage generator or power supply supplies pulses of energy by cables 32 to an electron or e- beam generator 34. The e- beam generator is a low energy e- beam generator, i.e., 500 keV or less that generates e" beam pulses on the order of nanoseconds to microseconds in duration. In the preferred mail treatment embodiment, the e™ beam generator is a 500 kev generator that irradiates each sensed envelope for 100-500 nanoseconds. This produces about a 60 kilogray (kGy) radiation dose for one pulse. A 50 kGy dose of radiation is currently recommended to deactivate Anthrax spores. Of course, the pulse duration and its energy will be adjusted to accommodate the type of microbes or microbial contamination to be deactivated. In other embodiments, for less radiation resistant microbial contamination, an electron beam with an energy of only a few hundred electron volts may suffice to deactivate the microbial contamination. A 10 nanosecond pulse at 100 keV produces a 3 kGy dose which is sufficient to deactivate many common bacteria. Storphylococcus aureus, for example, is deactivated with a 0.65-2.6 kGy radiation dose, Bacillus  sublilis is deactivated with a 2.6—12.9 kGy dose.<br><br><br>
Preferably, a pair of the low energy e~ beam generators 34 is disposed on opposite sides of the envelope. At 200 keV, the e" beams have very limited penetrating power, but are sufficient to penetrate normal thickness envelopes. However, because the penetration power is comparable with, the thickness of conventional envelopes, relatively minor amounts of radiation shielding 36 are sufficient to prevent stray electrons from reaching the environment.<br>
The timing and speed of the mail handling equipment that conveys the mail from the inlet port 34 to the treatment chamber 18 is coordinated with the speed of the trigger pulse generator 28 and the high voltage generator 30 such that the electron beam is formed when the envelope enters and as it passes through the chamber. After the envelope has been irradiated, it is passed to further mail handling and sorting equipment or stored in the buffer storage area 20,<br>
The throughput of envelopes on the mail conveyor is determined by the repetition rate of a pulsed, high voltage generator used to produce the electron beam. When the cross-section of the electron beam is comparable in size to the envelopes, an envelope process rate on the order of the repetition rate of the high voltage generator, used to generate ectron beam, is preferred, As is known in the industry, about   to 60% of the electron beam actually treats the microbial contamination in and/or on the mail. iith. a 500 kV high voltage generator, the Maximum repetition rate of the generator is typically about 1 kHz. Thus, it is possible to treat about 1,000 envelopes/second with the method of the present app1ication.<br>
With reference to FIGURE 2b, the envelope 12 passes more directly from the input port 14 to the treatment chamber 18. This facilitates higher mail handling speeds. A radiation shield 36 is placed between the input and the treatment chamber to prevent scattered and stray electrons from escaping at the input port 14. in one embodiment, the shield 36 is in the form of a shutter that moves into position between the passage of each piece of mail.  Alternately, the shield. 36 is in the form<br><br>
of a stationary plate with a thin slot consiessurate in. siae with the port 14, The shield: 36 can have an enlarged thickness adjacent the slot to prevent radiation at an acute angle from exiting. Once in the treatment chamber 18, the mail can  pause during treatment or can be treated during continuous movement. The presence of incoming mail is again sensed by a sensor 26 causing a trigger pulse generator 28 to generate a trigger pulse that causes a high voltage generator 30 to supply a high voltage pulse to the e" beam generators 34, The timing of the production of the e- beams relative to the mail handling system is selected such one or more 20 nanosecond e- beam pulses are generated during the time that the envelope is between the e" beam generators. Preferably, the e" beam is relatively wide enough to encompass the entire envelope in one shot. Alternately, the e" beam is smaller than the envelope; but, the envelope is conveyed through the conveyor system such that the entire envelope is exposed to the e- beam over two or more pulses. In this manner, deactivation of the microbial contam.lnat.ion contained within the envelope is effected.<br>
Preferably, the treatment chamber 18 is built around, a portion of the conveying system of in-place mail handling equipment. Alternately, a short extension, or an additional section of the same mail conveyor system is placed in a mail sorting machine currently in use to move the mail through, the treatment chamber 18.<br>
In the treatment of Entfarax spores., it is believed that electrons having a kinetic energy ranging from about 100 KeV to about 1,000 Kev (or eguivalently, 1 Mev) are sufficient to deactivate the AnthraX spores. • A combination of energetic electrons and x-rays can also be used to decontaminate mail housing Anthrax spores. in this regard, as known, to those skilled in the art, x-rays can foe "produced from the electron beam. Both the electron beam and the x-rays can then he directed toward a source of Anthrax spores or other microbial contamination for deactivation.<br>
It is also believed that the Anthrax spores are deactivated by the coupling of electron-irradiation damage clone<br><br>
to the DBA of Anthrax spores and the irradiation induced thermal heating of the Anthrax spores to at, least about 200* C.<br><br>
In, an. automatic teller machine embodiment (see FIGURE 2c), an ATM 10 receives flat objects 12 such as bills, bank notes, currency, ox tickets at an input output dispenser 38. The bills move at a slower speed through an irradiation chamber 18 into a cash storage box 20, 22, la ATMs, vending machines or ticket dispensers, the treatment chamber 18 is again built around a portion of the conveying or handling system*<br>
The banknotes, tickets, or the like 12 are stored in the storage box or hopper 22. As a bank note is fed out of the storage hopper, a aensor 26 causes a trigger circuit 28 to cause a power supply 30 to actuate e- beam generators 34. Once the bill is irradiated, it is dispensed to the customer through the dispenser 38.<br>
In the case of decontaminating paper currency, electrons having an energy ranging from about 0.2 to about 25 KeV are believed to be sufficient to deactivate contamination on the surfaces thereof. One can also use a combination of electrons and soft x-rays, the soft x-rays produced from a cathode plasma, i.e., a plasma produced in the neighborhood of a cathode of a high voltage generator used to produce the beam of electrons, to decontaminate paper currency; however, electrons are the preferred vehicle for such decontamination. As is well known to those skilled in the art, x-rays can be produced from an electron beam. Both forms of radiation, i.e., electrons and x-rays, can then be used to deactivate microbial contamination on paper currency.<br>
As mail, banks notes or paper currencies are irradiated, they absorb energy. In. the case of e~ beam irradiation, Joule heat is dissipated to the depth of the ©"beam penetration. In the case of banknotes and mail, such heating may have deleterious effects. For example, such heating effects could adversely affect the security mechanism of at least some<br><br><br>
banknotes. In the case of mail, such heating effects could also soften adhesives used to seal envelopes, darken, thermal printed labels, or simply destroy the paper of the envelopes. To overcome these deleterious effects,: pulsed electron beams arc used to irradiate flat objects. It is believed that the difference between the length in time duration of the pulses of e~ beams used {i.e., nanoseconds) and the length of times typically associated with the aforementioned chemical processes of degradation (i.e., microseconds to milliseconds) results in a nearly adiabatic treatment of the flat objects. In other words, the chemical processes involved to bring about the aforementioned degradations take anywhere from about 1,000 to about 1,000,000 times longer to play out than the time of exposure to one pulse of deactivating electrons,<br>
The use of a pulsed electron beam also provides for a high dose of radiation without the need of a high power accelerator. By using a pulsed system, dosage levels .ranging anywhere from about 30 to about 60 kGy can be attained without significant heating of the flat objects irradiated,<br>
Although described in terms of e" beam generators, it is to.be appreciated that the same system may be used for x-ray or gamma-ray decontamination. The high energy e- beam pulses can be applied to one or more of a bank of high energy x-ray tubes to effect an emission of x-ray pulses.<br><br><br>
