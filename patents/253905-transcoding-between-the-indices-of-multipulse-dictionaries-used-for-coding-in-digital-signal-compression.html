For each current pulse position supplied by a first coder, a neighborhood (Vge, Vde) is formed around that position. As a function of the pulse positions accepted by the second coder, pulse positions are selected in an ensemble constituted by a union of the neighborhoods. The second coder finally receives this selection (Sj), involving a number of pulse positions smaller than the total number of pulse positions in the dictionary of the second coder.

				<td>The present invention relates to coding and decoding<br>
digital signals, in particular in applications that<br>
transmit or store multimedia signals such as audio<br>
signals (speech and/or sound).<br>
In the field of compression coding, many coders<br>
model a signal of L samples using a number of pulses very<br>
much less than the total number of samples. This is the<br>
case of certain audio-frequency coders, for example, such<br>
as the "TDAC" audio coder described in particular in the<br>
published document US-2001/027393, in which modified<br>
normalized discrete cosine transform coefficients in each<br>
band are quantized by vectorial quantifiers using<br>
algebraic dictionaries of interleaved size, these<br>
algebraic codes generally including a few components that<br>
are non-zero, the other components being equal to zero.<br>
This is also the case with most speech coders using<br>
analysis by synthesis, in particular coders of the<br>
Algebraic Code Excited Linear Prediction (ACELP), Multi-<br>
Pulse Maximum Likelihood Quantization (MP-MLQ) and other<br>
types. To model the innovation signal, these coders use<br>
a directory composed of waveforms having very few<br>
components that are non-zero, having positions and<br>
amplitudes that additionally obey predetermined rules.<br>
Coders of the above kind using analysis by synthesis<br>
are briefly described below.<br>
In coders using analysis by synthesis, a synthesis<br>
model is used on coding to extract parameters modeling<br>
the signals to be coded, which may be sampled at the<br>
telephone frequency (Fe = 8 kilohertz (kHz)) or at a<br>
higher frequency, for example at 16 kHz for broadened<br>
band coding (passband from 50 hertz (Hz) to 7 kHz).<br>
Depending on the application and on the required quality,<br>
the compression rate varies from 1 to 16. These coders<br>
operate at bit rates from 2 kilobits per second (kbps) to<br><br>
16 kbps in the telephone band and from 6 kbps to 32 kbps<br>
in the broadened band.<br>
There follows a brief description of the CELP<br>
digital codec, which codec uses analysis by synthesis and<br>
is the one most widely used at present for<br>
coding/decoding speech signals. A speech signal is<br>
sampled and converted into a series of blocks of L'<br>
samples called frames. As a general rule, each frame is<br>
divided into smaller blocks of L samples called<br>
subframes. Each block is synthesized by filtering a<br>
waveform extracted from a directory (also called a<br>
dictionary) multiplied by a gain via two filters varying<br>
in time. The excitation dictionary is a finite set of<br>
waveforms of L samples. The first filter is a long-term<br>
prediction (LTP) filter. An LTP analysis evaluates the<br>
parameters of this LTP filter, which exploits the<br>
periodic nature of voiced sounds (typically representing<br>
the frequency of the fundamental pitch (the vibration<br>
frequency of the vocal chords)). The second filter is a<br>
short-term prediction filter. Linear prediction coding<br>
(LPC) analysis methods are used to obtain short-term<br>
prediction parameters representing the transfer function<br>
of the vocal tract and characteristic of the spectrum of<br>
the signal (typically representing the modulation<br>
resulting from the shape assumed by the lips, the<br>
positions of the tongue and of the larynx, etc.).<br>
The method used to determine the innovation sequence<br>
is the method known as analysis by synthesis. In the<br>
coder, a large number of innovation sequences from the<br>
excitation dictionary are filtered by the LTP and LPC<br>
filters and the waveform producing the synthetic signal<br>
closest to the original signal according to a perceptual<br>
weighting criterion, generally known as the CELP<br>
criterion, is selected.<br>
The use of multipulse dictionaries in these analysis<br>
by synthesis coders is described briefly below, on the<br><br>
understanding that CELP coders and CELP decoders are well<br>
known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
The multiple bit rate coder of the ITU-T G. 723.1<br>
Standard is a good example of a coder using analysis by<br>
synthesis that employs multipulse dictionaries. Here,<br>
the pulse positions are all separate. The two bit rates<br>
of the coder (6.3 kbps and 5.3 kbps) model the innovation<br>
signal by means of waveforms extracted from the<br>
dictionary that include only a small number of non-zero<br>
pulses: six or five for the high bit rate, four for the<br>
low bit rate. These pulses are of amplitude +1 or -1.<br>
In its 6.3 kbps mode, the G. 723.1 coder uses two<br>
dictionaries alternately:<br>
•	in the first dictionary, used for even subframes,<br>
the waveforms comprise six pulses, and<br>
•	in the second dictionary, used for odd subframes,<br>
they comprise five pulses.<br>
In both dictionaries, a single restriction is<br>
imposed on the positions of the pulses of any code-<br>
vector, which must all have the same parity, i.e. they<br>
must all be even or they must all be odd. In the<br>
5.3 kbps mode dictionary, the positions of the four<br>
pulses are more severely constrained. Apart from the<br>
same parity constraint as the dictionaries of the high<br>
bit rate mode, there is a limited choice of positions for<br>
each pulse.<br>
The 5.3 kbps mode multipulse dictionary belongs to<br>
the well-known family of ACELP dictionaries. The<br>
structure of an ACELP directory is based on the<br>
interleaved single-pulse permutation (ISPP) technique,<br>
which consists in dividing a set of L positions into K<br>
interleaved tracks, the N pulses being located in certain<br>
predefined tracks. In some applications, the dimension L<br>
of the code words can be expanded to L+N. Accordingly,<br>
in the case of the low bit rate mode directory of an ITU-<br>
T G.723.1 coder, the dimension of the block of 60 samples<br>
is expanded to 64 samples and the 32 even (or odd as the<br><br>
case may be) positions are divided into four non-<br>
overlapping interleaved tracks of length 8. There are<br>
therefore two groups of four tracks, one for each parity.<br>
Table 1 below sets out the four tracks for the even<br>
positions for each pulse io to i3.<br><br>
The ACELP innovation dictionaries are used in many<br>
standardized coders employing analysis by synthesis<br>
(ITU-T G.723.1, ITU-T G.729, IS-641, 3GPP NB-AMR,<br>
3GPP WB-AMR). Tables 2 to 4 below set out a few examples<br>
of these ACELP dictionaries for a block length of 40<br>
samples. Note that the parity constraint is not used in<br>
these dictionaries. Table 2 covers the ACELP dictionary<br>
for 17 bits and four non-zero pulses of amplitude ±1,<br>
used in the 8 kbps mode ITU-T G.729 coder, the IS-641<br>
7.4 kbps mode coder and the 7.4 and 7.95 kbps mode 3GPP<br>
NB-AMR coder.<br><br><br>
Table 3 covers the ACELP dictionary for 35 bits used<br>
in the 12.2 kbps mode 3GPP NB-AMR coder, in which each<br>
code-vector contains 10 non-zero pulses of amplitude ±1.<br>
The block of 40 samples is divided into five tracks of<br>
length 8 each containing two pulses. Note that the two<br>
pulses of the same track can overlap and result in a<br>
single pulse of amplitude ±2.<br><br>
Finally, Table 4 covers the ACELP dictionary for 11<br>
bits and two non-zero pulses of amplitude ±1 used in the<br><br>
low bit rate (6.4 kbps) extension of the ITU-T G.729<br>
coder and in the 5.9 kbps mode 3GPP NB-AMR coder.<br><br>
What is meant by "exploring" multipulse dictionaries<br>
is explained below.<br>
As with any quantizing operation, seeking the<br>
optimum modeling of a vector to be coded consists in<br>
selecting from the set (or a subset) of the code-vectors<br>
of the dictionary that which "resembles" it most closely,<br>
i.e. the one that minimizes the measured distance between<br>
it and that input vector. A step referred to as<br>
"exploring" the dictionaries is carried out for this<br>
purpose.<br>
In the case of multipulse dictionaries, this amounts<br>
to seeking the combination of pulses that optimizes the<br>
proximity of the signal to be modeled and the signal<br>
resulting from the choice of pulses. Depending on the<br>
size and/or the structure of the dictionary, this<br>
exploration may be exhaustive or non-exhaustive (and<br>
therefore more or less complex).<br>
Since the dictionaries used in the TDAC coder<br>
referred to above are unions of permutation codes of type<br>
II, the algorithm for coding a vector of normalized<br>
transform coefficients exploits this property to<br><br>
determine its nearest neighbor from all the code-vectors,<br>
calculating only a limited number of distance criteria<br>
(using so-called "absolute leader" vectors).<br>
In coders employing analysis by synthesis, the<br>
exploration of the multipulse dictionaries is not<br>
exhaustive except in the case of small dictionaries.<br>
Only a small percentage of dictionaries of higher bit<br>
rate is explored. For example, multipulse ACELP<br>
dictionaries are generally explored in two stages. To<br>
simplify this search, a first stage preselects the<br>
amplitude (and therefore the sign, see above) of each<br>
possible pulse position by simply quantizing a signal<br>
depending on the input signal. Since the amplitudes of<br>
the pulses are fixed, it is the positions of the pulses<br>
that are then searched for using an analysis by synthesis<br>
technique (conforming to the CELP criterion). Despite<br>
using the ISPP structure, and despite the small number of<br>
pulses, an exhaustive search of the combinations of<br>
positions is effected only for the low bit rate<br>
dictionaries (typically less than or equal to 12 bits).<br>
This applies to the 11-bit ACELP dictionary used in the<br>
6.4 kbps mode G.729 coder (see Table 4), for example, in<br>
which the 512 combinations of positions of two pulses are<br>
all tested to select the best one, which amounts to<br>
calculating the corresponding 512 CELP criteria.<br>
Various focusing methods have been proposed for<br>
dictionaries of higher bit rate. The expression "focused<br>
search" is then used.<br>
Some of those prior art methods are used in the<br>
standardized coders mentioned above. Their aim is to<br>
reduce the number of combinations of positions to be<br>
explored on the basis of the properties of the signal to<br>
be modeled. One example is the "depth-first tree"<br>
algorithm used by many standardized ACELP coders, in<br>
which preference is given to certain positions, such as<br>
the local maxima of the tracks of a target signal<br>
depending on the input signal, the past synthetic signal,<br><br>
and a filter composed of synthesis and perceptual<br>
weighting filters. There are several variants of this,<br>
depending on the size of the dictionary used. To explore<br>
the ACELP dictionary for 35 bits and 10 pulses (see Table<br>
3)	, the first pulse is placed at the same position as the<br>
global maximum of the target-signal. This is followed by<br>
four iterations by circular permutation of the<br>
consecutive tracks. On each iteration, the position of<br>
the second pulse is fixed at the local maximum of one of<br>
the other four tracks, and the positions of the remaining<br>
other eight pulses are searched for sequentially in pairs<br>
in interleaved loops. 256 (8x8x4 pairs) different<br>
combinations are tested on each iteration, which means<br>
that only 1024 combinations of positions of the 10 pulses<br>
among the 225 of the dictionary can be explored. A<br>
different variant is used in the IS641 coder, in which a<br>
higher percentage of combinations of the dictionary for<br>
17 bits and four pulses (see Table 2) is explored. 768<br>
combinations of the 8192 (=213) combinations of pulse<br>
positions are tested. In the 8 kbps G.729 coder, the<br>
same ACELP dictionary is explored by a different focusing<br>
method. The algorithm effects an iterative search by<br>
interleaving four pulse search loops (one per pulse).<br>
The search is focused by making entry into the interior<br>
loop (search for the last pulse belonging to tracks 3 or<br>
4)	conditional on exceeding an adaptive threshold that<br>
also depends on the properties of the target-signal<br>
(local maximum values and mean values of the first three<br>
tracks). Moreover, the maximum number of explorations of<br>
combinations of four pulses is fixed at 1440 (which<br>
represents 17.6% of the 8192 combinations).<br>
In the 6.3 kbps mode G. 723.1 coder, not all the<br>
2x25xC305 (or 2x26xC306) combinations of five (or six)<br>
pulses are explored. For each chart, the algorithm<br>
employs a known "multipulse" analysis to search<br>
sequentially for the positions and the amplitudes of the<br><br>
pulses. As with the ACELP dictionaries, there are<br>
variants that restrict the number of combinations tested.<br>
The above techniques suffer from the following<br>
problems, however.<br>
The exploration of a multipulse dictionary, even a<br>
sub-optimum exploration thereof, constitutes in many<br>
coders a costly operation in terms of calculation time.<br>
For example, in the 6.3 kbps mode G.723.1 and 8 kbps mode<br>
G.729 coders, the search represents close to half the<br>
total complexity of the coder. For the NB-AMR coder, it<br>
represents one third of the total complexity. For the<br>
TDAC coder, it represents one quarter of the total<br>
complexity.<br>
It is clear in particular that this complexity<br>
becomes critical if a plurality of coding operations have<br>
to be carried out by the same processor unit, such as a<br>
gateway managing many calls in parallel or a server<br>
distributing many multimedia contents. The complexity<br>
problem is accentuated by the multiplicity of compression<br>
formats circulating on the networks.<br>
To offer mobility and continuity, modern and<br>
innovative multimedia communications services must be<br>
able to operate under a wide variety of conditions. The<br>
dynamism of the multimedia communications sector and the<br>
heterogeneous nature of the networks, access points and<br>
terminals have generated a plethora of compression<br>
formats whose presence in communications systems<br>
necessitates multiple coding either in cascade<br>
(transcoding) or in parallel (multiformat coding or<br>
multimode coding).<br>
The meaning of the term "transcoding" is explained<br>
below. Transcoding becomes necessary if, in a<br>
transmission system, a compressed signal frame sent by a<br>
coder can no longer proceed in the same format.<br>
Transcoding converts the frame to another format<br>
compatible with the remainder of the transmission system.<br>
The most elementary solution (and therefore that in most<br><br>
widespread use at present) is to place a decoder and a<br>
coder back to back. The compressed frame arrives with a<br>
first format and is decompressed. The decompressed<br>
signal is then compressed with a second format accepted<br>
by the remainder of the communications system. Such a<br>
cascade of a decoder and a coder is referred to as<br>
"tandem". That solution is very costly in terms of<br>
complexity (essentially because of the recoding) and<br>
degrades quality because the second coding is effected on<br>
a decoded signal, which is a degraded version of the<br>
original signal. Moreover, a frame may encounter several<br>
tandems before reaching its destination. The calculation<br>
cost and the loss of quality are not difficult to<br>
imagine. Moreover, the delays linked to each tandem<br>
operation are cumulative and can compromise the<br>
interactivity of calls.<br>
What is more, complexity also causes problems in a<br>
multiformat compression system in which the same content<br>
is compressed to more than one format. This is the case<br>
of content servers that broadcast the same content in a<br>
plurality of formats adapted to the access conditions,<br>
networks and terminals of different customers. This<br>
multicoding operation becomes extremely complex as the<br>
number of formats required increases, which rapidly<br>
saturates the resources of the system.<br>
Another case of multiple coding in parallel is a<br>
posteriori decision multimode compression. A plurality<br>
of compression modes are applied to each segment of the<br>
signal to be coded, and that which optimizes a given<br>
criterion or achieves the best bit rate/distortion trade-<br>
off is selected. Once again, the complexity of each of<br>
the compression modes limits the number thereof and/or<br>
leads to an a priori selection of a very small number of<br>
modes.<br>
Prior art approaches to solving the above problems<br>
are described below.<br><br>
New multimedia communications applications (such as<br>
audio and video applications) often necessitate a<br>
plurality of coding operations either in cascade<br>
(transcoding) or in parallel (multicoding and a<br>
posteriori decision multimode coding). The problem of<br>
the complexity barrier resulting from all these coding<br>
operations remains to be solved, despite the increase in<br>
current processing powers. Most prior art multiple<br>
coding operations do not take account of interactions<br>
between formats and between the format of the coder E and<br>
its content. Nevertheless, a few intelligent transcoding<br>
techniques have been proposed that are not satisfied<br>
merely by decoding and then recoding, but instead exploit<br>
the similarities between coding formats so that<br>
complexity can be reduced whilst limiting the resulting<br>
degradation.<br>
So-called "intelligent" transcoding methods are<br>
described below.<br>
All the coders in the same family of coders (CELP,<br>
parametric, transform, etc.) extract the same physical<br>
parameters from the signal. There is nevertheless great<br>
variety in terms of modeling and/or quantizing those<br>
parameters. Thus the same parameter may be coded in the<br>
same way or very differently from one coder to another.<br>
Moreover, the coding may be strictly identical, or<br>
it may be identical in terms of modeling and calculation<br>
of the parameter, but differ simply in how the coding is<br>
translated into the form of bits. Finally, the coding<br>
may be completely different in terms of modeling and<br>
quantizing the parameter, or even in terms of its<br>
analysis or sampling frequency.<br>
If modeling and parameter calculation are strictly<br>
identical, including translation to bit form, it suffices<br>
to copy the corresponding bit field from the bit stream<br>
generated by the first coder to that of the second. This<br>
highly favorable situation arises on transcoding from the<br><br>
G.729 standard to the IS-641 standard for adaptive<br>
excitation (LTP delays), for example.<br>
If, for the same parameter, the two coders differ<br>
only in terms of the translation of the calculated<br>
parameter into bit form, it suffices to decode the bit<br>
field of the first format and then to return it to the<br>
binary domain using the coding method of the second<br>
format. This conversion may also be effected by means of<br>
one-to-one correspondence tables. This is the situation<br>
when transcoding fixed excitations from the<br>
G.729 standard to the AMR standard (7.4 kbps and<br>
7.95 kbps modes), for example.<br>
In the above two situations, transcoding the<br>
parameter remains at the bit level. Simple bit<br>
manipulation renders the parameter compatible with the<br>
second coding format. On the other hand, if a parameter<br>
extracted from the signal is modeled or quantized<br>
differently by two coding formats, passing from one to<br>
the other is not such a simple matter. Several methods<br>
have been proposed. They operate at the parameter level,<br>
the excitation level, or the decoded signal level.<br>
For transcoding in the parameter domain, remaining<br>
at the parameter level is possible if the two coding<br>
formats calculate a parameter in the same way but<br>
quantize it differently. Quantizing differences may be<br>
related to the accura y or the method selected (scalar,<br>
vectorial, predictive, etc.). It then suffices to decode<br>
the parameter and then to quantize it using the method of<br>
the second coding format. That prior art method is used<br>
at present for transcoding excitation gains in<br>
particular. The decoded parameter must often be modified<br>
before it is requantized. For example, if the coders<br>
have different parameter analysis frequencies or<br>
different frame/subframe lengths, it is standard practice<br>
to interpolate/decimate the parameters. Interpolation<br>
may be effected by the method described in the published<br>
document US2003/033142, for example. Another<br><br>
modification option is to round off the parameter to the<br>
accuracy imposed on it by the second coding format. This<br>
situation is encountered for the most part for the height<br>
of the fundamental frequency ("pitch").<br>
If it is not possible to transcode a parameter<br>
within the parameter domain, decoding can go to a higher<br>
level. This is the excitation domain, without going so<br>
far as the signal domain. This technique has been<br>
proposed for gains in the document "Improving transcoding<br>
capability of speech coders in clean and frame erasured<br>
channel environments", Hong-Goo Kang, Hong Kook Kim, Cox,<br>
R.V., Speech Coding, 2000, Proceedings 2000, IEEE<br>
Workshop on Speech Coding, Pages 78-80.<br>
Finally, a last solution (the most complex and the<br>
least "intelligent") consists in recalculating the<br>
parameter explicitly, as the coder would, but based on a<br>
synthesized signal. This operation amounts to a kind of<br>
partial tandem, with only some parameters being entirely<br>
recalculated. This method has been applied to diverse<br>
parameters such as the fixed excitation, the gains in the<br>
IEEE reference cited above, or the pitch.<br>
For transcoding pulses, although several techniques<br>
have been developed to calculate the parameters quickly<br>
and at lower cost, few solutions available today use an<br>
intelligent approach to calculating the pulses of one<br>
format from the equivalent parameter in another format.<br>
In coding using analysis by synthesis, intelligent<br>
transcoding of pulse codes is applied only if the<br>
modeling is identical (or close) . In contrast, if the<br>
modeling is different, the partial tandem method is used.<br>
Note that to limit the complexity of this operation,<br>
focused approaches have been proposed that exploit the<br>
properties of the decoded signal or a derived signal such<br>
as a target-signal. In the document US-2001/027393 cited<br>
above, in an embodiment utilizing an MDCT transform<br>
coder, there is described a bit rate change procedure<br>
that may be considered a special case of intelligent<br><br>
transcoding. That procedure requantizes a vector from a<br>
first dictionary using a vector from a second dictionary.<br>
To this end it distinguishes between two situations<br>
depending on whether the vector to be requantized belongs<br>
to the second dictionary or not. If the quantized vector<br>
belongs to the new dictionary, the modeling is identical;<br>
if not, the partial decoding method is applied.<br>
Setting itself apart from all the above prior art<br>
techniques, the present invention proposes a method of<br>
multipulse transcoding based on selecting a subset of<br>
combinations of pulse positions of an ensemble of sets of<br>
pulses from a combination of pulse positions of another<br>
ensemble of sets of pulses, the two ensembles being<br>
distinguished by the numbers of pulses that they include<br>
and by rules governing their positions and/or their<br>
amplitudes. This form of transcoding is very beneficial<br>
for multiple coding in cascade (transcoding) or in<br>
parallel (multicoding and multimode coding) in<br>
particular.<br>
To this end, the present invention firstly proposes<br>
a method of transcoding between a first compression codec<br>
and a second compression codec. The first and second<br>
codecs are of pulse type and use multipulse dictionaries<br>
in which each pulse has a position marked by an<br>
associated index.<br>
The transcoding method of the invention includes the<br>
following steps:<br>
a)	where appropriate, adapting coding parameters<br>
between said first and second codecs;<br>
b)	obtaining from the first codec a selected number<br>
of pulse positions and respective position indices<br>
associated therewith;<br>
c)	for each current pulse position of given index,<br>
forming a group of pulse positions including at least the<br>
current pulse position and the pulse positions with<br>
associated indices immediately below and immediately<br>
above the given index;<br><br>
d)	selecting as a function of pulse positions<br>
accepted by the second codec at least some of the pulse<br>
positions in an ensemble constituted by a union of said<br>
groups formed in step c); and<br>
e)	sending the selected pulse positions to the<br>
second codec for coding/decoding from the positions sent.<br>
The selection step d) therefore involves a number of<br>
pulse positions that is less than the total number of<br>
pulse positions in the dictionary of the second codec.<br>
It is clear in particular that if, in the step e),<br>
the second above-mentioned codec is a coder, the selected<br>
pulse positions are transmitted to that coder for coding<br>
by searching only the positions transmitted. If the<br>
second above-mentioned codec is a decoder, the selected<br>
pulse positions are transmitted for the positions to be<br>
decoded.<br>
The step b) preferably uses partial decoding of the<br>
bit stream supplied by the first codec to identify a<br>
first number of pulse positions that the first codec uses<br>
in a first coding format. The number chosen in the step<br>
b) therefore preferably corresponds to this first number<br>
of pulse positions.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment, the above steps are<br>
executed by a software product including program<br>
instructions to that effect. In this regard, the present<br>
invention is also directed to a software product of the<br>
above kind adapted to be stored in a memory of a<br>
processor unit, in particular of a computer or a mobile<br>
terminal, or on a removable memory medium adapted to<br>
cooperate with a reader of the processor unit.<br>
The present invention is also directed to a device<br>
for transcoding between first and second compression<br>
codecs, in which case it includes a memory adapted to<br>
store instructions of a software product of the type<br>
described above.<br>

Note first that the present invention relates to<br>
modeling and coding digital multimedia signals such as<br>
audio (speech and/or sound) signals using multipulse<br>
dictionaries. It may be implemented in the context of<br>
multiple coding/decoding in cascade or in parallel or of<br><br>
any other system modeling a signal by means of a<br>
multipulse representation and which, based on the<br>
knowledge of a first set of pulses belonging to a first<br>
ensemble, has to determine at least one set of pulses of<br>
a second ensemble. For conciseness, only the passage<br>
from a first ensemble to another ensemble is described,<br>
but the invention applies equally to passage to n<br>
ensembles (n ≥ 2) . Moreover, only the situation of<br>
"transcoding" between two coders is described below, but<br>
transcoding between a coder and a decoder can of course<br>
be deduced from this without major difficulty.<br>
Consider the case therefore of modeling a signal by<br>
sets of pulses corresponding to two coding systems.<br>
Figures la and lb represent a transcoder D between a<br>
first coder E using a first coding format C0D1 and a<br>
second coder S using a second coding format C0D2. The<br>
coder E delivers a coded bit stream SCE in the form of a<br>
succession of coded frames to the transcoder D, which<br>
includes a partial decoder module 10 for recovering the<br>
number Ne of pulse positions used in the first coding<br>
format and the positions pe of those pulses. As emerges<br>
in detail below, the transcoder of the invention extracts<br>
the right-hand neighbor ved and the left-hand neighbor veg<br>
of each pulse position pe and selects pulse positions in<br>
the union of those neighborhoods that will be recognized<br>
by the second coder S. The module 11 of the transcoder<br>
represented in Figures 1a and 1b therefore performs these<br>
steps to deliver this selection of positions (denoted Sj<br>
in Figures 1a and 1b) to the second coder S. It will be<br>
clear in particular that from this selection Sj there is<br>
constituted a subdirectory smaller than the dictionary<br>
usually employed by the second coder S, which is one of<br>
the advantages of the invention. Using this<br>
subdirectory, the coding effected by the coder S is of<br>
course faster, because it is more restricted, but without<br>
this degrading coding quality.<br><br>
In the example represented in Figure 1a, the<br>
transcoder D further includes a module 12 for at least<br>
partly decoding the coded stream SCE that the first coder<br>
E delivers. The module 12 then supplies to the second<br>
coder S an at least partly decoded version s'0 of the<br>
original signal s0. The second coder S then delivers a<br>
coded bit stream sCs based on that version s'0.<br>
In this configuration, the transcoder D therefore<br>
effects coding adaptation between the first coder E and<br>
the second coder S, advantageously favoring faster<br>
(because more restricted) coding by the second coder S.<br>
Of course, as an alternative to this, the entity<br>
referenced S in Figures 1a and 1b may be a decoder and,<br>
in this variant, the transcoder D of the invention<br>
effects transcoding proper between a coder E and a<br>
decoder S, this decoding being fast because of the<br>
information supplied by the transcoder D. Since the<br>
process is reversible, it is clear that, much more<br>
generally, the transcoder D in the sense of the present<br>
invention operates between a first codec E and a second<br>
codec S.<br>
Note that the arrangement of the coder E, the<br>
transcoder D and the coder S may conform to a "cascade"<br>
configuration as represented in Figure 1a. In the<br>
variant represented in Figure 1b, this arrangement may<br>
conform to a "parallel" configuration. In this case, the<br>
two coders E and S receive the original signal s0 and the<br>
two coders E and S deliver the coded streams SCE and sCs,<br>
respectively. Of course, here the second coder S no<br>
longer has to receive the version s'0 from Figure 1a and<br>
the module 12 of the transcoder D for at least partial<br>
decoding is no longer necessary. Note further that, if<br>
the coder E can provide an output compatible with the<br>
input of the module 11 (number of pulses and pulse<br>
positions), the module 10 may simply be omitted or<br>
"bypassed".<br><br>
Note further that the transcoder D may simply be<br>
equipped with a memory for storing instructions for<br>
implementing the foregoing steps and a processor for<br>
processing those instructions.<br>
The invention is therefore applied as follows. The<br>
first coder E has effected its coding operation on a<br>
given signal s0 (for example the original signal) . The<br>
positions of the pulses selected by the first coder E are<br>
therefore available. That coder determined these<br>
positions pe using a technique of its own during the<br>
coding process. The second coder S must also perform its<br>
coding. In the case of transcoding, the second coder S<br>
has only the bit stream generated by the first coder and<br>
the invention is here applicable to "intelligent"<br>
transcoding as defined above. In the case of multiple<br>
coding in parallel, the second coder S also has the<br>
signal that the first coder has and here the invention<br>
applies to "intelligent multicoding". A system that<br>
requires to code the same content in a plurality of<br>
formats can exploit the information of a first format to<br>
simplify coding the other formats. The invention can<br>
also be applied to the particular situation of multiple<br>
coding in parallel constituting a posteriori decision<br>
multimode coding.<br>
The present invention can be used to determine<br>
quickly the positions ps (interchangeably denoted Si<br>
below) of the pulses for another coding format from<br>
positions pe (interchangeably denoted ei below) of the<br>
pulses of a first format. It considerably reduces the<br>
calculation complexity of this operation for the second<br>
coder by limiting the number of possible positions. To<br>
this end, it uses the positions selected by the first<br>
coder to define a restricted set of positions from all<br>
possible positions of the second coder, in which<br>
restricted set the best set of positions for the pulses<br>
is searched for. This results in a significant increase<br><br>
in complexity whilst limiting degradation of the signal<br>
relative to a standard exhaustive or focused search.<br>
It is therefore clear that the present invention<br>
limits the number of possible positions by defining a<br>
restricted set of positions based on positions from the<br>
first coding format. It differs from existing solutions<br>
in that they use only the properties of the signal to be<br>
modeled to limit the number of possible positions, by<br>
giving preference to and/or eliminating positions.<br>
For each pulse of a set of a first ensemble, two<br>
neighbors (one on the right and one on the left) of<br>
variable width and of greater or lesser constraint are<br>
preferably defined and an ensemble of possible positions<br>
extracted therefrom within which at least one combination<br>
of pulses complying with the constraints of the second<br>
ensemble will be preselected.<br>
The transcoding method has the advantage of<br>
optimizing the complexity/quality trade-off by adapting<br>
the number of pulse positions and/or the respective sizes<br>
(in terms of combinations of pulse positions) of the<br>
right-hand and left-hand neighborhoods for each pulse,<br>
either at the beginning of the processing or for each<br>
subframe as a function of the authorized complexity<br>
and/or the set of starting positions. The invention also<br>
adjusts/limits the number of combinations of positions by<br>
advantageously favoring the immediate neighborhoods.<br>
As indicated above, the present invention is also<br>
directed to a software product the algorithm whereof is<br>
designed in particular to extract neighbor positions that<br>
facilitate composing the combinations of pulses of the<br>
second ensemble.<br>
As indicated above, the heterogeneous nature of the<br>
networks and the contents may call highly varied coding<br>
formats into play. Coders may be distinguished by<br>
numerous characteristics, of which two in particular, the<br>
sampling frequency and the duration of a subframe,<br>
substantially determine the mode of operation of the<br><br>
invention. The options are described below in<br>
corresponding relationship to embodiments of the<br>
invention suited to these situations.<br>
Figure 2 summarizes these situations. There are<br>
initially obtained:<br>
•	the numbers Ne, Ns of pulse positions,<br>
•	the respective sampling frequencies Fe, Fs, and<br>
•	the subframe durations Le, Ls<br>
used by the coders E and S, respectively (step 21). Thus<br>
it is already clear that steps of adaptation and of<br>
recovering the numbers Ne, Ns of pulse positions may<br>
advantageously be interchanged or simply conducted<br>
simultaneously.<br>
The sampling frequencies are compared in a test 22.<br>
If the frequencies are equal, the subframe durations are<br>
compared in a test 23. If not, the sampling frequencies<br>
are adapted in a step 32 by a method described below.<br>
Following the test 23, if the subframe durations are<br>
equal, the numbers Ne and Ns of pulse positions used by<br>
the first and second coding formats, respectively, are<br>
compared in a test 24. If not, the subframe durations<br>
are adapted in a step 33 using a method that is also<br>
described below. It is clear that the steps 22, 23, 32<br>
and 33 together define the above step a) of adapting the<br>
coding parameters. Note that the steps 22 and 32<br>
(sampling frequency adaptation), on the one hand, and the<br>
steps 23 and 33 (subframe duration adaptation) , on the<br>
other hand, may be interchanged.<br>
There is first described below a situation in which<br>
the sampling frequencies are equal and the subframe<br>
durations are equal.<br>
This is the most favorable situation, but it is<br>
nevertheless necessary to distinguish the situation in<br>
which the first format uses more pulses than the second<br>
(Ne ≥ Ns) and the contrary situation (Ne 
to the result of the test 24.<br><br>
* Ne ≥ Ns in Figure 2<br>
The principle is as follows. The directories of the<br>
two coders E and S use Ne and Ns pulses in each subframe,<br>
respectively.<br>
The coder E calculates the positions of its Ne pulses<br>
over the subframe se. These positions are interchangeably<br>
denoted ei and pe below. The restricted ensemble Ps of<br>
privileged positions for the pulses of the directory of<br>
the coder S is then made up of Ne positions ei and their<br>
neighborhoods:<br><br>
where vid and vig ≥ 0 are the sizes of the right-hand and<br>
left-hand neighborhoods of the pulse i. The values of vid<br>
and vig, which are chosen in the step 27 in Figure 2, are<br>
larger or smaller according to the complexity and quality<br>
required. These sizes may be fixed arbitrarily at the<br>
beginning of processing or chosen for each subframe se.<br>
In step 29 in Figure 2, the ensemble Ps then contains<br>
each position ei as well as its right-hand neighbors vid<br>
and its left-hand neighbors vig.<br>
It is then necessary to define for each of the Ns<br>
pulses from the directory of the coder S the positions<br>
which that pulse is authorized to assume among those<br>
proposed by Ps.<br>
To this end, rules governing the construction of the<br>
directory of S are introduced. It is assumed that the Ns<br>
pulses of S belong to predefined subsets of positions, a<br>
given number of pulses sharing the same sub-set of<br>
authorized positions. For example, the 10 pulses of the<br>
12.2 kbps mode 3GPP NB-AMR coder are distributed two by<br>
two into five different subsets, as shown in Table 3<br>
above. N's denotes the number of subsets of different<br>
positions (N's ≤ Ns in this example since N's = 5) and Tj<br>
(for j = 1 to N's) denotes the subsets of positions<br>
defining the directory of S.<br><br>
Starting from the ensemble Ps, the N's subsets Sj<br>
resulting from the intersection of Ps with one of the<br>
ensembles Tj are constituted in step 30 in Figure 2 from<br>
the equation:<br>
Sj = Pa ∩ Tj<br>
The neighborhoods vid and vig must be of sufficient size<br>
for no intersection to be empty. It is therefore<br>
necessary to allow adjustment of the neighborhood sizes,<br>
if necessary, as a function of the starting set of<br>
pulses. This is the purpose of the test 34 in Figure 2,<br>
with an increase in the size of the neighborhoods (step<br>
35) and a return to the definition of the union Ps of the<br>
groups formed in the step c) (step 29 in Figure 2) if one<br>
of the intersections is empty. On the other hand, if<br>
none of the intersections Sj is empty, it is the<br>
subdirectory consisting of those intersections Sj that is<br>
sent to the coder S (end step 31).<br>
The invention advantageously exploits the structure<br>
of the directories. For example, if the directory of the<br>
coder S is of the ACELP type, it is the intersections of<br>
the positions of the tracks with Ps that are calculated.<br>
If the directory of the coder E is also of the ACELP<br>
type, the neighborhood extraction procedure also exploits<br>
the track structure and the steps of extracting the<br>
neighborhoods and composing restricted subsets of<br>
positions are judiciously combined. In particular, it is<br>
beneficial for the neighborhood extraction algorithm to<br>
take account of the composition of the combinations of<br>
pulses in accordance with the constraints of the second<br>
ensemble. As will emerge later, neighborhood extraction<br>
algorithms are produced to facilitate the composition of<br>
combinations of pulses of the second ensemble. One of<br>
the embodiments described later (from ACELP with two<br>
pulses to ACELP with four pulses) is an example of this<br>
kind of algorithm.<br><br>
The number of possible combinations of positions is<br>
therefore small and the size of the subset of the<br>
directory of the coder S is generally very much less than<br>
that of the original directory, which greatly reduces the<br>
complexity of the penultimate transcoding step. The<br>
number of combinations of pulse positions defines the<br>
size of the aforementioned subset. It is the number of<br>
pulse positions the invention reduces, which leads to a<br>
reduction in the number of combinations of pulse<br>
positions and thus makes it possible to obtain a<br>
subdirectory of restricted size.<br>
Step 4 6 in Figure 3 then consists in launching the<br>
search for the best set of positions for the Ns pulses in<br>
that subdirectory of restricted size. The selection<br>
criterion is similar to that of the coding process. To<br>
reduce complexity further, exploration of this<br>
subdirectory can be accelerated using the prior art<br>
focusing techniques described above.<br>
Figure 3 summarizes the steps of the invention for a<br>
situation in which the coder E uses at least as many<br>
pulses as the coder S. However, as already pointed out<br>
with reference to Figure 2, if the number Ns of positions<br>
to the second format (the format of S) is greater than<br>
the number Ne of positions to the first format (the format<br>
of E) , the processing differs only in a few advantageous<br>
variants that are described later.<br>
In outline, the Figure 3 steps are summarized as<br>
follows. After a step a) of adapting the coding<br>
parameters (present only if necessary and therefore<br>
represented in dashed outline in the block 41 in<br>
Figure 3):<br>
•	recovering the positions ei of the pulses of the<br>
coder E, and preferably a number Ne of positions (step 42<br>
corresponding to the above-mentioned step b)),<br>
•	extracting the neighborhoods and forming groups of<br>
neighborhoods in accordance with the equation:<br><br><br>
(step 43 corresponding to the above-mentioned step c)),<br>
•	composing restricted subsets {Sj = Ps ∩ Tj} of<br>
positions forming the selection of the above-mentioned<br>
step d) and corresponding to the step 44 represented in<br>
Figure 3, and<br>
•	forwarding that selection to the coder S (step 45<br>
corresponding to the above-mentioned step e) ) . After<br>
this step 45, the coder S then chooses a set of positions<br>
in the restricted directory obtained in the step 44.<br>
The next step is therefore a step 46 of searching<br>
the subdirectory received by the coder S for a set<br>
(opt(Sj)) of optimum positions including the second number<br>
Ns of positions, as indicated above. To accelerate the<br>
exploration of the subdirectory, this step 46 of<br>
searching for the optimum set of positions is preferably<br>
implemented by means of a focused search. Processing<br>
continues naturally with the coding that is effected<br>
thereafter by the second coder S.<br>
There are described next the forms of processing<br>
provided for the situation in which the number Ne of<br>
pulses used by the first coding format is lower than the<br>
number N3 of pulses used by the second coding format.<br>
* Ne 
If the format of S uses more pulses than the format<br>
of E, the process is similar to that explained above.<br>
However, pulses of the format of S may not have positions<br>
in the restricted directory. In this case, in a first<br>
embodiment, all possible positions are authorized for<br>
those pulses. In a second and preferred embodiment the<br>
sizes of the neighborhoods V'd and V'g are simply<br>
increased in step 28 in Figure 2.<br><br>
*	Ne<ns in figure></ns>
A special case must be emphasized here. If Ne is<br>
close to Ns, typically if Ne 
way to determine the positions may be envisaged, even<br>
though the above form of processing remains entirely<br>
applicable. A further reduction in complexity may be<br>
obtained by directly fixing the positions of the pulses<br>
of S on the basis of those of E. The Ne first pulses of S<br>
are placed at the positions of those of E. The remaining<br>
Ng - Ne pulses are placed as close as possible the first Ne<br>
pulses (in their immediate neighborhood). Step 25 in<br>
Figure 2 then tests if the numbers Ne and Ns are close<br>
(with Ne &gt; Ns) and, if so, the choice of the pulse<br>
positions in step 26 is as described above.<br>
Of course, in both cases, Ne 
if one of the intersections Sj is empty despite the above<br>
precautions, the size of the neighborhoods V+g, V+d, is<br>
simply increased in step 35, as described in the<br>
situation where Ne ≥ Ns.<br>
Finally, in all cases, if none of the intersections<br>
Sj is empty, the subdirectory formed by the intersections<br>
Sj is forwarded to the second coder S (step 31).<br>
There are described next the forms of processing<br>
used in the adaptation step a) if the coding parameters<br>
of the first and second formats are not the same, in<br>
particular their sampling frequencies and subframe<br>
durations.<br>
The following situations are then distinguished.<br>
*	Equal subframe durations but different sampling<br>
frequencies<br>
This situation corresponds to "n" for the test 22<br>
and "y" for the test 23 in Figure 2. The adaptation step<br>
a) then applies to step 32 in Figure 2.<br>
The previous processing cannot be applied directly<br>
here because the two formats do not have the same time<br>
subdivision. Because the sampling frequencies are<br><br>
different, the two frames do not have the same number of<br>
samples over the same duration.<br>
Rather that determining the positions of the pulses<br>
of the format of the coder S without taking account of<br>
those of the format of the coder E, as a tandem would do,<br>
two different forms of processing constituting two<br>
different embodiments are proposed here. They limit<br>
complexity by establishing a correspondence between the<br>
positions of the two formats, after which the processing<br>
reverts to the processing described above (as if the<br>
sampling frequencies were equal).<br>
The processing of the first embodiment uses direct<br>
quantization of the time scale of the first format by<br>
that of the second format. This quantizing operation,<br>
which may be tabulated or computed from a formula, finds<br>
for each position of a subframe of the first format its<br>
equivalent in a subframe of the second format, and vice-<br>
versa .<br>
For example, the correspondence between the<br>
positions pe and ps in the subframes of the two formats<br>
may be defined by the following equation:<br><br>
in which Fe and Fs are the sampling frequencies of E and<br>
S, respectively,<br>
Le and Ls are their subframe lengths, and<br>
  denotes the integer part.<br>
Depending on the characteristics of the processor<br>
unit, this correspondence could use the above formula or<br>
advantageously be tabulated for the Le values. An<br>
intermediate solution may also be selected by tabulating<br>
only the first Je values   d being the highest<br>
common factor of Le and Ls) , the remaining positions then<br>
being easily deduced.<br>
Note that it is also possible to make a plurality of<br>
positions of the subframe of S correspond to a position<br><br>
of a subframe of E. For example, retaining the positions<br>
immediately below and immediately above <br>
The general processing described above is applied<br>
starting from the ensemble of positions ps corresponding<br>
to the positions pe, (extraction of neighborhoods,<br>
composition of combinations of pulses, selection of the<br>
optimum combination).<br>
This situation of equal subframe durations but<br>
different sampling frequencies is found in Tables 5a to<br>
5d below, referring to an embodiment in which the coder E<br>
is of the 3GPP NB-AMR type and the coder S is of the WB-<br>
AMR type. The NB-AMR coder has a subframe of 40 samples<br>
for a sampling frequency of 8 kHz. The WB-AMR coder uses<br>
64 samples per subframe at 12.8 kHz. In both cases, the<br>
subframe has a duration of 5 ms. Table 5a gives the<br>
correspondence of the positions in a NB-AMR subframe to a<br>
WB-AMR subframe and Table 5b gives the converse<br>
correspondence. Tables 5c and 5d are the restricted<br>
correspondence tables.<br><br><br><br>
Briefly, the following steps apply (see Figure 2a):<br>
a1) direct timescale quantization from the first<br>
frequency to the second frequency (step 51 in Figure 2a),<br>
a2) as a function of that quantization, determination of<br>
each pulse position in a subframe with the second coding<br>
format characterized by the second sampling frequency<br>
from a pulse position in a subframe with the first coding<br>
format characterized by the first sampling frequency<br>
(step 52 in Figure 2a).<br>
In general terms, the quantization step a1) is<br>
effected by calculation and/or tabulation from a function<br>
which makes correspond to a pulse position pe in a<br>
subframe with the first format a pulse position ps in a<br>
subframe with the second format; that function actually<br>
takes the form of a linear combination involving a<br>
multiplier coefficient corresponding to the ratio of the<br>
second sampling frequency to the first sampling<br>
frequency.<br>
Moreover, to go in the opposite direction from a<br>
pulse position in a subframe with the second format ps to<br>
a pulse position in a subframe with the first format pe,<br>
there is of course applied an inverse function of this<br>
linear combination applied to a pulse position in a<br>
subframe with the second format ps.<br><br>
Clearly the transcoding process is completely<br>
reversible and is as equally adapted to one transcoding<br>
direction (E-&gt;S) as to the other (S-&gt;E).<br>
A second embodiment of sampling frequency adaptation<br>
uses a conventional change of sampling frequency<br>
principle. Starting from the subframe containing the<br>
pulses found by the first format, oversampling is applied<br>
at the frequency equal to the lowest common multiple of<br>
the two sampling frequencies Fe and Fs. Then, after low-<br>
pass filtering, undersampling is applied to revert to the<br>
sampling frequency of the second format, i.e. Fs. There<br>
is obtained a subframe at the frequency Fs containing the<br>
filtered pulses from E. Once again, the result of the<br>
oversampling/LP filtering/undersampling operations can be<br>
tabulated for each possible position of a subframe of E.<br>
This processing can also be effected by "on line"<br>
calculation. As in the first embodiment of sampling<br>
frequency adaptation, one or more positions of S may be<br>
associated with a position of E, as explained below, and<br>
the general processing in the sense of the above-<br>
described invention applied.<br>
As indicated in the variant represented in<br>
Figure 2b, the following steps apply:<br>
a'1) oversampling a subframe with the first coding format<br>
characterized by the first sampling frequency at a<br>
frequency Fpcm equal to the lowest common multiple of the<br>
first and second sampling frequencies (step 53 in<br>
Figure 2b), and<br>
a'2) applying low-pass filtering to the oversampled<br>
subframe (step 54 in Figure 2b), followed by<br>
undersampling to achieve a sampling frequency<br>
corresponding to the second sampling frequency (step 55<br>
in Figure 2b).<br>
The process continues by obtaining, preferably by a<br>
thresholding method, a number of positions, possibly a<br>
variable number of positions, adapted from the pulses of<br>
E (step 56), as in the above first embodiment.<br><br>
* Equal sampling frequencies but different subframe<br>
durations<br>
The processing carried out in the situation where<br>
the sampling frequencies are equal but the subframe<br>
durations are different is described next. This<br>
situation corresponds to "n" for the test 23 but "o" for<br>
the test 22 of Figure 2. The adaptation step a) then<br>
applies to the step 33 in Figure 2.<br>
As in the above situation, the neighborhood<br>
extraction step as such cannot be applied directly. It<br>
is first necessary to make the two subframes compatible.<br>
Here the subframes differ in size. Faced with this<br>
incompatibility, rather than calculate the positions of<br>
the pulses like the tandem does, a preferred embodiment<br>
offers a solution of low complexity that determines a<br>
restricted directory of combinations of positions for the<br>
pulses of the second format from the positions of the<br>
pulses of the first format. However, the subframe of S<br>
and that of E not being the same size, it is not possible<br>
to establish a direct temporal correspondence between a<br>
subframe of S and a subframe of E. As shown in Figure 4<br>
(in which the subframes of E and S are designated STE and<br>
STS, respectively), the boundaries of the subframes of the<br>
two formats are not aligned and over time the subframes<br>
shift relative to each other.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, it is proposed to divide<br>
the excitation of E into pseudosubframes the size of<br>
those of S and at the timing rate of S. The<br>
pseudosubframes are denoted STE' in Figure 5. In<br>
practice, this amounts to establishing a temporal<br>
correspondence between the positions in the two formats<br>
taking account of the subframe size difference to align<br>
the positions relative to an origin common to E and S.<br>
The determination of that common origin is described in<br>
detail later.<br><br>
A position p°e (respectively p°s) of the first format<br>
(respectively the second format) relative to that origin<br>
coincides with the position pe (respectively ps) of the<br>
subframe ie (respectively js) of E (respectively S)<br>
relative to that subframe. Thus:<br><br>
To a position pe of the subframe ie of the format of<br>
E there corresponds the position ps of the subframe js of<br>
the format of S, ps and js being respectively the<br>
remainder and the quotient of the Euclidian division by Ls<br>
of the position p°e of pe relative to an origin 0 common<br>
to E and S:<br><br>
with 0 ≤ pe 
 denoting the integer part, ≡ denoting the modulus, the<br>
index of a subframe of E (respectively S) being given<br>
relative to the common origin O.<br>
Accordingly, the positions pe in a subframe js are<br>
used to determine a restricted ensemble of positions for<br>
pulses of S in the subframe js by means of the general<br>
process described above. However, if Le &gt; Ls, a subframe<br>
of S may not contain any pulse. In the Figure 6 example,<br>
the pulses of the subframe STEO are represented by<br>
vertical lines. The format of E may very well<br>
concentrate the pulses of STEO at the end of the<br>
subframe, in which case the pseudosubframe STE'0 does not<br>
contain any pulse. All the pulses placed by E are found<br>
in STE'1 upon division. In this case, a conventional<br>
focused search is preferably applied to the<br>
pseudosubframe STE'0.<br>
Preferred embodiments for the determination of a<br>
time origin 0 common to the two formats are described<br>
next. That common reference constitutes the position<br>
(number 0) from which the positions of the pulses are<br><br>
numbered in the subsequent subframes. This position 0<br>
can be defined in various ways, depending on the system<br>
utilizing the transcoding method of the present<br>
invention. For example, for a transcoder module included<br>
in a transmission system equipment, it will be natural to<br>
take for the origin the first position of the first frame<br>
received after the equipment is started up.<br>
However, the disadvantage of that choice is that the<br>
positions take increasingly large values and it may<br>
become necessary to limit them. For this it suffices to<br>
update the position of the common origin whenever<br>
possible. Accordingly, if the respective lengths Le and<br>
Ls of the subframes of E and S are constant over time, the<br>
position of the common origin is reset each time that the<br>
boundaries of the subframes of E and S are aligned. This<br>
occurs periodically, the period (expressed in samples)<br>
being equal to the lowest common multiple of Le and Ls.<br>
The situation may also be envisaged in which Le<br>
and/or Ls are not constant in time. It is no longer<br>
possible to find a multiple common to the two subframe<br>
lengths, at present denoted Le(n) and Ls(n), where n<br>
represents the subframe number. In this case, it is<br>
necessary to sum the values Le(n) and Ls(n) on the fly and<br>
to compare the two sums obtained in each subframe:<br><br>
Each time that Te(k) = Ts(k'), the common origin is<br>
updated (and taken at the position k x Le or k' x Ls) .<br>
The two sums Te and Ts are preferably reset.<br>
Briefly, and more generally, calling the first<br>
(respectively second) subframe duration the subframe<br>
duration of the first (respectively second) coding<br>
format, the adaptation steps executed when the subframe<br><br>
durations are different are summarized in Figure 7, and<br>
are preferably as follows:<br>
a20) defining an origin 0 common to subframes with the<br>
first and second formats (step 70),<br>
a21) dividing the successive subframes with the first<br>
coding format characterized by a first subframe duration<br>
into pseudosubframes of duration L'e corresponding to the<br>
second subframe duration (step 71),<br>
a22) updating of the common origin 0 (step 79), and<br>
a23) determining the correspondence between the pulse<br>
positions in the pseudosubframes p'e and in the subframes<br>
with the second format (step 80).<br>
To determine the common origin 0, the following<br>
cases are preferably discriminated in the test 72 in<br>
Figure 7:<br>
•	the first and second durations are fixed in time<br>
("o" exit from test 72); and<br>
•	the first and second durations vary in time ("n"<br>
exit from test 72).<br>
In the former case, the time position of the common<br>
origin is updated periodically (step 74), each time that<br>
the boundaries of the respective subframes of first<br>
duration St(Le) and second duration St(Ls) are aligned in<br>
time (test 73 applied to those boundaries).<br>
In the second case, it is preferable if:<br>
a221) the respective summations of subframes with the<br>
first format Te(k) and subframes with the second format<br>
Ts(k') are effected successively (step 76),<br>
a.222) equality of said two sums is detected, defining a<br>
time for updating said common origin (test 77), and<br>
a223) the aforesaid two sums are reset (step 78) , after<br>
said equality is detected, for future detection of a next<br>
common origin.<br>
Now, in the situation in which the subframe<br>
durations and sampling frequencies are different, it<br>
suffices to combine judiciously the algorithms of the<br><br>
correspondences between the positions of E and S<br>
described for the above two situations.<br>
*	EMBODIMENTS<br>
Three embodiments of transcoding in accordance with<br>
the invention are described next. These embodiments<br>
describe the application of the processing provided in<br>
the situations described above in standard speech coders<br>
using analysis by synthesis. The first two embodiments<br>
illustrate the favorable situation in which the sampling<br>
frequencies and the subframe durations are identical.<br>
The final embodiment illustrates the situation in which<br>
the subframe durations are different.<br>
*	Embodiment no. 1<br>
The first embodiment applies to intelligent<br>
transcoding between the 6.3 kbps mode G.723.1 MP-MLQ<br>
model and the 5.3 kbps mode G.723.1 ACELP model with four<br>
pulses.<br>
Intelligent transcoding from the high bit rate to<br>
the low bit rate of G. 723.1 employs an MP-MLQ model with<br>
six and five pulses with an ACELP model with four pulses.<br>
The embodiment described here determines the positions of<br>
the four ACELP pulses from the positions of the MP-MLQ<br>
pulses.<br>
The operation of the G.723.1 coder is summarized<br>
below.<br>
The ITU-T G.723.1 multiple bit rate coder and its<br>
multipulse directories have been described above.<br>
Suffice to say that a G.723.1 frame contains 240 samples<br>
at 8 kHz and is divided into four subframes each of 60<br>
samples. The same restriction is imposed on the<br>
positions of the pulses of any code-vector of each of the<br>
three multipulse dictionaries. These positions must all<br>
have the same parity (they must all be even or all be<br>
odd). The subframe of 60(+4) positions is therefore<br>
divided into two grids each of 32 positions. The even<br><br>
grid includes the positions numbered [0, 2, 4, ..., 58,<br>
(60,62)]. The odd grid includes the positions [1, 3,<br>
5, ..., 59, (61,63)]. For each bit rate, exploration of<br>
the directory, although not exhaustive, remains complex,<br>
as indicated above.<br>
The selection of a subset of the 5.3 kbps mode<br>
G.723.1 ACELP directory from an element of a 6.3 kbps<br>
mode G.723.1 MP-MLQ directory is described next.<br>
The aim is to model the innovation signal of a<br>
subframe by means of an element from the 5.3 kbps mode<br>
G.723.1 ACELP directory knowing the element of the<br>
6.3 kbps mode MP-MLQ G.723.1 directory determined during<br>
a first coding operation. The Ne positions (Ne = 5 or 6)<br>
of the pulses selected by the 6.3 kbps mode G.723.1 coder<br>
are therefore available.<br>
For example, it may be assumed that the positions<br>
extracted from the bit stream of the 6.3 kbps mode<br>
G.723.1 coder for a subframe whose excitation is modeled<br>
by Ne = 5 pulses are as follows:<br><br>
Remember that no adaptation of sampling frequency or<br>
subframe duration is required here. After this step of<br>
recovering the positions ei, a subsequent step then<br>
consists in extracting the right-hand and left-hand<br>
neighborhoods of those five pulses directly. The right-<br>
hand and left-hand neighborhoods are here taken to be<br>
equal to two. The ensemble Ps of positions selected is:<br><br>
The third step consists in composing the restricted<br>
ensemble of possible positions for each pulse (here one<br>
track) of the ACELP directory of the 5.3 kbps mode<br>
G. 723.1 coder by taking Ns = 4 intersections of Ps with<br>
the four ensembles of positions of the even tracks<br>
(respectively odd tracks) authorized by said directory<br>
(as represented in Table 1).<br><br><br>
The combination of these selected positions<br>
constitutes the new restricted directory in which the<br>
search will be effected. For this step, the procedure<br>
for selecting the set of optimum positions is based on<br>
the CELP criterion, as in the 5.3 kbps mode G.723.1<br>
coder. The exploration may be exhaustive but is<br>
preferably focused.<br>
The number of combinations of positions in the<br>
restricted directory is equal to 180 (= 4*3*3*4+2*1*3*3)<br>
instead of 8192 (= 2*8*8*8*8) combinations of positions<br>
of the ACELP directory of the 5.3 kbps mode G.723.1<br>
coder.<br>
The number of combinations may be further restricted<br>
by considering only the parity chosen for the 6.3 kbps<br>
mode (in the present example that is the even parity) .<br>
In this case, the number of combinations in the<br>
restricted directory is equal to 144.<br>
Depending on the size of the neighborhoods<br>
concerned, for one of the four pulses the ensemble Ps may<br>
not contain any position for a track of the ACELP model<br>
(situation in which one of the ensembles Si is empty) .<br>
Accordingly, for neighborhoods of size 2, when the<br>
positions of the Ne pulses are all on the same track, Ps<br>
contains only positions of that track and adjacent<br>
tracks. In this case, depending on the required<br>
quality/complexity trade-off, it is possible either to<br>
replace the ensemble Si with Ti (which amounts to not<br>
restricting the ensemble of positions of that track) or<br>
to increase the right-hand (or left-hand) neighborhood of<br><br>
the pulses. For example, if all the pulses of the<br>
6.3	kbps mode coder are on track 2, with right-hand and<br>
left-hand neighborhoods equal to two, then track 0 will<br>
have no positions regardless of the parity. It then<br>
suffices to increase by 2 the size of the left-hand<br>
and/or right-hand neighborhood to assign positions to<br>
that track 0.<br>
To illustrate this embodiment, consider the<br>
following example:<br><br>
* Embodiment no. 2<br>
The following second embodiment illustrates the<br>
application of the invention to intelligent transcoding<br>
between ACELP models of the same length. In particular,<br>
this second embodiment is applied to intelligent<br>
transcoding between the ACELP model with four pulses of<br>
8 kbps mode G.729 and the ACELP with two pulses of<br>
6.4	kbps mode G.729.<br>
Intelligent transcoding between the 6.4 kbps and<br>
8 kbps modes of the G.729 coder utilizes one ACELP<br>
directory with two pulses and a second one with four<br>
pulses. The embodiment described here determines the<br>
positions of four pulses (8 kbps) from the positions of<br>
two pulses (6.4 kbps) and vice-versa.<br><br>
The operation of the ITU-T G.729 encoder is<br>
described briefly. This coder can operate at three bit<br>
rates: 6.4, 8 and 11.8 kbps. The first two bit rates are<br>
considered here. A G.729 frame contains 80 samples at<br>
8 kHz and is divided into two subframes each of 40<br>
samples. For each subframe, G.729 models the innovation<br>
signal by means of pulses conforming to the ACELP model.<br>
It uses four pulses for the 8 kbps mode and two pulses<br>
for the 6.4 kbps mode. Tables 2 and 4 above give the<br>
positions that the pulses can adopt for those two bit<br>
rates. At 6.4 kbps, an exhaustive search of all (512)<br>
combinations of positions is effected. At 8 kbps, a<br>
focused search is preferably used.<br>
The general processing in accordance with the<br>
invention is used again here. However, the ACELP<br>
structure common to the two directories is advantageously<br>
exploited here. Establishing the correspondence between<br>
the sets of positions therefore exploits a division of<br>
the subframe of 40 samples into five tracks each of eight<br>
positions, as set out in Table 6 below.<br><br>
In the two directories, the positions of the pulses<br>
share these tracks, as shown in Table 7 below.<br>
All the pulses are characterized by the their track<br>
and their rank in that track. The 8 kbps mode places a<br><br>
pulse on each of the first three tracks and the last<br>
pulse on one of the last two tracks. The 6.4 kbps mode<br>
places its first pulse on track P1 or P3 and its second<br>
pulse on track P0, P1, P2 or P4.<br><br>
This embodiment exploits interleaving of the tracks<br>
(ISSP structure) to facilitate extracting the<br>
neighborhoods and composing the restricted subensembles<br>
of positions. Accordingly, to move from one track to<br>
another, it suffices to shift one unit to the right or to<br>
the left. For example, at the 5th position of track 2<br>
(absolute position 22), a shift of one unit to the right<br>
(+1) goes to the 5th position on track 3 (absolute<br>
position 23) and a shift of one unit to the left (-1)<br>
goes to the 5th position of track 1 (absolute position<br>
21).<br><br><br><br>
The selection of a subensemble of the ACELP<br>
directory with four pulses of the 8 kbps mode G.729 coder<br>
from an element of an ACELP directory with two pulses of<br>
the 6.4 kbps mode G.729 coder is described next.<br>
A 6.4 kbps mode G.729 subframe is considered. Two<br>
pulses are placed by the coder, but it is necessary to<br>
determine the positions of the other pulses that the<br>
8 kbps mode G.729 must place. To restrict complexity<br>
radically, only one position per pulse is selected and<br>
only one combination of positions is retained. This has<br>
the advantage that the selection step is therefore<br>
immediate. Two of the four pulses of the 8 kbps mode<br>
G.729 are selected at the same positions as those of the<br>
6.4 kbps mode, after which the remaining two pulses are<br>
placed in the immediate neighborhood of the first two.<br>
As indicated above, the track structure is exploited. In<br>
the first step of recovering the two positions by<br>
decoding the binary index (on nine bits) of the two<br>
positions, the corresponding two tracks are also<br>
determined. From those two tracks (which may be<br>
identical), the last three steps of extracting the<br>
neighborhoods, composing the restricted subensembles and<br>
selecting a combination of pulses are then judiciously<br>
associated. Different cases are then distinguished<br>
according to the tracks Pi (i = 0 to 4) containing the two<br>
6.4 kbps mode pulses.<br>
The positions of the 6.4 kbps mode pulses are<br>
denoted ek and those of the 8 kbps mode pulses are denoted<br>
Sk. Table 8 below gives the selected positions in each<br>
case. The columns labeled "Pj+d=Pi" specify the<br><br><br>
The aim is therefore preferably to balance the<br>
distribution of the four positions relative to the two<br>
starting positions, although a different choice may be<br>
made. Four situations (indicated by an exponent in<br>
parentheses in Table 8) may nevertheless give rise to<br>
edge effect problems:<br><br><br>
Situation (4): if e1 = 39, we cannot take s0 = e1 + 1, so<br>
we choose S0 = e0 - 3.<br>
To reduce complexity further, the sign of each pulse sk<br>
may be taken as equal to that of the pulse ej from which<br>
it is deduced.<br>
The selection of a subensemble of the 6.4 kbps mode<br>
G.729 ACELP directory with two pulses from an element of<br>
an 8 kbps mode G.729 ACELP directory with four pulses is<br>
described next.<br>
For an 8 kbps mode G.729 subframe, the first step is<br>
to recover the positions of the four pulses generated by<br>
the 8 kbps mode. Decoding the binary index (on 13 bits)<br>
of these four positions yields their rank in their<br>
respective track for the first three positions (tracks 0<br>
to 2) and the track (3 or 4) of the fourth pulse together<br>
with its rank in that track. Each position ei (0 ≤ i 
is characterized by the pair (pi,mi) in which pi is the<br>
index of its track and mi is its rank in that track. We<br>
have:<br><br>
As already mentioned, neighborhood extraction	and<br>
restricted subensemble composition are combined	and<br>
advantageously exploit the ISSP structure common to	the<br>
two directories. The five intersections T'j of	the<br>
ensemble Ps of the neighborhoods of the four positions<br>
with the five tracks Pj are constructed by exploiting	the<br>
adjacent position property induced by interleaving	the<br>
tracks:<br><br>
Accordingly, a right-hand (respectively left-hand)<br>
neighborhood of +1 (respectively -1) of the pulse (p,m)<br>
belongs to T'p+1 if p  0) ,<br>
if not (p = 4) to T'0 on condition that m 
(respectively to T'4 (I = 0) on condition that m &gt; 0) .<br>
The restriction on the right-hand neighbor for a position<br>
of the fourth pulse belonging to the fourth track<br><br>
(respectively left-hand neighbor for a position of the<br>
first track) ensure that adjacent position is not outside<br>
the sub-frame.<br>
Accordingly, using the modulo 5 notation (≡5), a<br>
right-hand (respectively left-hand) neighbor of +1<br>
(respectively -1) of the pulse (p,m) belongs to T'(P+1)≡5<br>
(respectively to T'(P+1)≡5 . Note that it is necessary to<br>
take account of edge effects. Generalizing to a<br>
neighborhood size d, a right-hand neighbor of +d<br>
(respectively a left-hand neighbor of -d) of the pulse<br>
(p,m) belongs to T'(P+1)≡5 (respectively T'(P+1)≡5. The rank<br>
of the neighbor of ±d is equal to m if p + d ≤ 4 (or<br>
p - d ≥ 0) , otherwise the rank m is incremented for a<br>
right-hand neighbor and decremented for a left-hand<br>
neighbor. Taking account of edge effects therefore<br>
amounts to ensuring that m4 and m &gt; 0 if<br>
p - d 
Starting from this distribution of the neighbors in<br>
the five tracks, it is a simple matter to determine the<br>
subensembles S0 and Si of the positions of the two pulses:<br>
S0 = T*iUT'3 and S1 = T ' 0UT ' XUT ' 2UT ' 4<br>
The fourth and final step consists in searching for<br>
the optimum pair in the two subensembles obtained. The<br>
search algorithm (like the standardized algorithm<br>
exploiting the track structure) and the track by track<br>
storage of pulses once again simplify the search<br>
algorithm. In practice, it is therefore of no utility to<br>
construct the restricted subensembles S0 and S1<br>
explicitly, as the ensembles T'j can be used alone.<br>
In the following example, the four 8 kbps mode G.729<br>
pulses have been placed at the following positions:<br>
e0 = 5; e1 = 21; e2 = 22; e3 = 34.<br>
Those four positions are characterized by the four pairs<br>
(Pi,mi) = (0,1), (1, 4), (2,4) (4,6) .<br>
Taking a fixed neighborhood equal to 1, the five<br>
intersections T'j are constructed as follows:<br><br><br>
In the final step, an algorithm similar to that of<br>
the G.729 6.4 kbps mode effects the search for the best<br>
pair of pulses. That algorithm is much less complex here<br>
as the number of combinations of positions to be explored<br>
is very small. In the example, there number of<br>
combinations to be tested is only 4 (Cardinal (T'1) +<br>
Cardinal (T'3)) multiplied by 8 (Cardinal (T'0) +<br>
Cardinal (T'1) + Cardinal (T'2) + Cardinal (T'4)), i.e. 32<br>
combinations instead of 512.<br>
For a neighborhood of size 1, less than 8% of the<br>
combinations of positions are to be explored on average,<br>
without exceeding 10% (50 combinations). For a<br>
neighborhood of size 2, less than 17% of combinations of<br>
positions are to be explored on average and at most 25%<br>
of the combinations are to be explored. For a<br>
neighborhood of size 2, the complexity of the processing<br>
proposed by the invention (lumping together the cost of<br>
searching the restricted directory and the cost of<br>
extracting the neighborhoods associated with the<br><br>
composition of the intersections) represents less than<br>
30% of an exhaustive search for an equivalent quality.<br>

The final embodiment illustrates passing between the<br>
8 kbps mode G.729 ACELP model and the 6.3 kbps mode<br>
G.723.1 MP-MLQ model.<br>
Intelligent transcoding of the pulses between<br>
G.723.1 (6.3 kbps mode) and G.72 9 (8 kbps mode) entails<br>
two major difficulties. Firstly, the size of the frames<br>
is different (40 samples for G.729 as against 60 samples<br>
for G.723.1). The second difficulty is linked to the<br>
different structures of the dictionaries (ACELP type for<br>
G.729 and MP-MLQ type for G.723.1). The embodiment<br>
described here shows how the invention eliminates these<br>
two problems in order to transcode the pulses at reduced<br>
cost whilst preserving transcoding quality.<br>
First of all a temporal correspondence is set up<br>
between the positions in the two formats, taking account<br>
of the size difference of the subframes to align the<br>
positions relative to an origin common to E and S. The<br>
G.729 and G.723.1 subframe lengths having a lowest common<br>
multiple of 120, the temporal correspondence is set up by<br>
blocks of 120 samples, i.e. two G.723.1 subframes for<br>
every three G.729 subframes, as shown in the Figure 4b<br>
example. Alternatively, it might be preferable to work<br>
on complete blocks of frames. In this case, blocks of<br>
240 samples are chosen, i.e. a G.723.1 frame (four<br>
subframes) for every three G.729 frames (six subframes).<br>
There is described next the selection of a<br>
subensemble of the 6.3 kbps mode G.723.1 MP-MLQ directory<br>
from elements of the 8 kbps mode G.729 ACELP directory<br>
with four pulses. The first step consists in recovering<br>
the positions of the pulses by blocks of three G.729<br>
subframes (with index ie, 0 ≤ ie ≤ 2) . The position of<br>
that block in the subframe ie is denoted pe(ie) .<br><br>
Before neighborhood extraction, the 12 positions<br>
Pe(ie) are converted into 12 positions ps(js) divided into<br>
two G.723.1 subframes (of index js, 0 ≤ js ≤ 1). The<br>
above general equation may be used (involving the modulus<br>
of the subframe length) to perform the adaptation of the<br>
subframe durations. However, it is preferred here merely<br>
to distinguish three situations according to the value of<br>
the index ie:<br><br>
Thus no division and no operation modulo n are effected.<br>
The four positions recovered in the subframe STEO of<br>
the block are directly assigned to the subframe STSO with<br>
the same position, those of the subframe STE2 of the<br>
block are directly assigned to the subframe STS1 with a<br>
position increment of +20, the positions of the subframe<br>
STE1 below 20 are assigned to the subframe STSO with an<br>
increment of +40, and the others are assigned to the<br>
subframe STS1 with an increment of -20.<br>
The neighborhoods of those 12 positions are then<br>
extracted. Note that the right-hand (respectively left-<br>
hand) neighborhoods of the positions of the subframe STSO<br>
(respectively STS1) to be extracted from their subframe<br>
can be authorized, these neighbor positions being then in<br>
the subframe STS1 (respectively STSO).<br>
The temporal correspondence and neighborhood<br>
extraction steps can be interchanged. In this case, the<br>
right-hand (respectively left-hand) neighborhoods of the<br>
positions of the subframe STEO (respectively STE2) to be<br>
extracted from their subframe can be authorized, those<br>
neighbor positions then being in the subframe STE1.<br>
Similarly, the right-hand (respectively left-hand)<br>
neighborhoods of the positions in STE1 can lead to<br>
neighbor positions in STE2 (respectively STEO).<br><br>
Once the ensemble of restricted positions for each<br>
subframe STS has been constituted, the final step<br>
consists in exploring the restricted directory<br>
constituted in this way for each subframe STS to select<br>
the Np (= 6 or 5) pulses with the same parity. This<br>
procedure can be derived from the standardized algorithm<br>
or take its inspiration from other focusing procedures.<br>
To illustrate this embodiment, consider three G.729<br>
subframes that can be used to construct the<br>
subdirectories of two G.723.1 subframes. Assume that<br>
G.729 yields the following positions:<br><br>
Thus we have the sets of positions {1, 5, 32,	39,<br>
44, 55} for the subframe STSO and {2, 11, 20, 21, 44,	57}<br>
for the subframe STS1.<br>
At this stage it is necessary to extract	the<br>
neighborhoods. Taking a neighborhood fixed at 1,	for<br>
example, we obtain:<br><br>
MP-MLQ imposes no constraint on the pulses, apart<br>
from their parity. Over a subframe, they must all have<br>
the same parity. It is therefore necessary here to split<br>
Ps0 and Ps1 into two subensembles, as follows:<br>
•	Ps0: {0,2,4,6,32,40,44,54,56} and {1,5,31,33,39,43,45,55}<br>
•	Psl:{2,10,12,20,22,44,56} and {1,3,11,21,23,43,45,57}<br><br>
Finally, this subdirectory is transmitted to the<br>
selection algorithm that determines the Np best positions<br>
in the sense of the CELP criterion for the G.723.1<br>
subframes FTSO et STS1. This considerably reduces the<br>
number of combinations to be tested. For example, there<br>
remain in the subframe STSO nine even positions and eight<br>
odd positions, rather than 30 and 30.<br>
Certain precautions are nevertheless required in<br>
situations in which the positions selected by G.729 are<br>
such that the extraction of the neighborhoods yields a<br>
number N of possible positions lower than the G.723.1<br>
number of positions (N 
particular if the G.729 positions are all in sequence<br>
(for example: {0,1,2,3}). There are then two options:<br>
•	either to increase the size of the neighborhood<br>
for the subframes concerned until a sufficient size is<br>
obtained for Ps (size ≥ Np) /<br>
•	or to select the first N pulses and authorize for<br>
the remaining Np - N pulses a search among the 30 - N<br>
remaining positions of the grid, as described above.<br>
The opposite processing operation, consisting in<br>
selecting a subensemble of the 8 kbps mode G.729 ACELP<br>
directory with four pulses from elements of a 6.3 kbps<br>
mode G.723.1 MP-MLQ directory, is described next.<br>
Overall, the process is similar. Two G.723.1<br>
subframes correspond to three G.72 9 frames. Once again,<br>
the G.723.1 positions are extracted and translated into<br>
the G.729 time frame. These positions could<br>
advantageously be translated in the form "track - rank in<br>
the track" in order to benefit as before from the ACELP<br>
structure to extract the neighborhoods and search for the<br>
optimum positions.<br>
The same arrangements as before are adopted to<br>
prevent situations in which neighborhood extraction would<br>
yield an insufficient number of positions (here fewer<br>
than four positions).<br><br>
Thus the present invention determines at lower cost<br>
the positions of a set of pulses from a first set of<br>
pulses, the two sets of pulses belonging to two<br>
multipulse directories. Those two directories may be<br>
distinguished by their size, the length and the number of<br>
pulses of their code words, and the rules governing the<br>
positions and/or amplitudes of the pulses. Preference is<br>
given to the neighborhoods of the positions of the pulses<br>
of the selected set(s) in the first directory to<br>
determine those of a set in the second directory. The<br>
invention further exploits the structure of the starting<br>
and/or destination directories to reduce complexity<br>
further. From the first embodiment described above<br>
entailing changing from an MP-MLQ model to a ACELP model,<br>
it will be clear that the invention is easy to apply to<br>
two multipulse models having different structural<br>
constraints. From the second embodiment, entailing<br>
passing between two models having different numbers of<br>
pulses based on the same ACELP structure, it will be<br>
clear that the invention advantageously exploits the<br>
structure of the directories to reduce transcoding<br>
complexity. From the third embodiment, entailing passing<br>
between an MP-MLQ model and an ACELP model, it will be<br>
clear that the invention may even be applied to coders<br>
with different subframe lengths or sampling frequencies.<br>
The invention adjusts the quality/complexity trade-off<br>
and in particular greatly reduces the calculation<br>
complexity for a minimum deterioration compared to a<br>
conventional search of a multipulse model.<br><br>

ABSTRACT<br><br>
TRANSCODING BETWEEN INDICES OF MULTIPULSE DICTIONARIES<br>
USED IN COMPRESSIVE CODING OF DIGITAL SIGNALS<br>
The invention relates to compressive transcoding between<br>
pulse coders using multipulse dictionaries in which each<br>
pulse occupies a position marked by an index. For each<br>
current pulse position supplied by a first coder, a<br>
neighborhood (Vge, Vde) is formed around that position. As<br>
a function of the pulse positions accepted by the second<br>
coder, pulse positions are selected in an ensemble<br>
constituted by a union of the neighborhoods. The second<br>
coder finally receives this selection (Sj), involving a<br>
number of pulse positions smaller than the total number<br>
of pulse positions in the dictionary of the second coder.<br>
