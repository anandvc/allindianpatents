The following Specification particularly describes the invention and the<br>
manner in which it is to be performed<br>
 <br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention, in general, relates to the field of multifunction peripherals (MFP). Further this invention relates to automatic document feeders (ADF) and facilities with respect to ADFs in MFPs. More particularly, this invention relates to a method of covering and locking the ADF in an MFP.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
United States Patent number 5,157,448 titled “Automatic copier or printer paper tray lock” is incorporated herein to explain the present state of technology.<br>
In the said patent, a reproduction machine paper loading drawer interlock system which provides protection from jams by preventing drawer opening during sheet feeding there from, yet provides more frequent and/or rapid drawer access for copy paper loading, particularly desirable for loading one drawer while running the machine and feeding sheets from another drawer, by independently operating each paper drawer interlock from the existing wiring and electrical signals for the paper feeder drive for that drawer, without any wiring or unique software requirements from the machine controller, or requiring any machine “cycle out” signals there from, or actuation of any manually actuated unlocking switches.<br>
Further, United States Patent number 6,581,923 titled “Automatic sheet feeder” is also incorporated herein to explain the present state of technology. An automatic document feeder (ADF) used in a facsimile machine, photocopier or the like to feed the document for scanner unit. This enables easier handling of more document pages for scanning in comparison to a flatbed scanner. Automatic Documents Feeder supplies paper to be scanned to ADF and feeds papers one by one to the scanning unit.<br>
Mostly MFPs are used in business environments where the confidentiality of data being scanned is very important. Also some time for quality concerns the Time taken for scanning is also more. One needs to stay and collect back the documents<br>
2<br>
 <br>
fed in a ADF and has to wait until the operation or scanning is complete.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  <br>
As mentioned above , MFPs are primarily used in business environments where the confidentiality of data being scanned is very important. Also some time for quality concerns the Time taken for scanning is also more and increases on the quality of scan being done 1200dpi color scan takes more time. One needs to stay and collect the documents fed in a ADF and has to wait until the operation or scanning is complete.<br>
The invention is to overcome the above scenario by having a detachable ADF cover and locking mechanism so that the user can place the documents to be scanned and start the operation.<br>
Once the operation starts the cover automatically locks. The user can go and continue his work. Once the operation is complete the user would be sent a note of the same to his PC. So the user can come and unlock and take the original documents safely. The user can also give some timeout so that the cover will remain locked till that time. The documents are maintained safe while scanning is in progress.<br>
Accordingly, this invention explains a method of covering and locking the ADF in an MFP, the said method comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	placing the documents to be processed in ADF and setting the job settings;<br>
(b)	attaching the ADF cover to the said MFP;<br>
(c)	providing an ADF locking option to the said MFP using an user interface;<br>
(d)	setting the said ADF locking option  by setting a FLAG in the said MFP to<br>
true; and<br>
(e)	locking the ADF cover when said FLAG is set to TRUE and an event is sent<br>
to the Locking mechanism which is used to lock the ADF Cover.<br>
3<br>
 <br>
A timeout value is set for the said ADF locking option which is stored in the said MFP. The said MFP provides a notification mechanism for the ADF locking option .If the said timeout value is set then the MFP sends the event to the locking mechanism only after the timeout value has lapsed. If the said notification mechanism is set then the said MFP sends the notification, indicating the status of the job. Once a event is received by the Locking mechanism to unlock the ADF Cover, the said MFP unlocks the ADF and its cover.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
Mostly MFP is used in business environments where the confidentiality of data being scanned is very important. Also some time for quality concerns the Time taken for scanning is also more and increases on the quality of scan being done<br>
4<br>
 <br>
1200dpi color scan takes more time. One needs to stay and collect back the documents fed in a ADF and has to wait until the operation or scanning is complete.<br>
The invention is to overcome the above scenario by having a detachable ADF cover and locking mechanism so that the user can place the documents to be scanned and start the operation.<br>
Once the operation starts the cover automatically locks. The user can go and continue his work. Once the operation is complete the user would be sent a note of the same to his PC. So the user can come and unlock and take the original documents safely. The user can also give some timeout so that the cover will remain locked till that time. The documents are maintained safe while scanning is in progress.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 1 illustrated an MFP incorporating an automatic document feeder (ADF).<br>
The facsimile machine includes a recording unit 2 and a scanning unit 1 on the recording unit 2. The recording unit 2 includes a printer module and paper feed cassette below the printer module. Recording sheets stacked in the paper feed cassette are fed to the printer module, and the sheets are discharged onto a tray after the printing.<br>
The scanning unit 1 has a casing 10 and a hinge extending from a bottom of the casing 10. The hinge is rotatably supported by a pin 1a located on the recording unit 2. Thus, the scanning unit 1 can pivot about the pin 1a upwards to a raised position and downwards to a lowered position relative to the recording unit 2. If the scanning unit 1 pivots upwards, the upper portion of the recording unit 2 is exposed so that a user can easily replace a toner and other parts/elements in the printer module 3 from the above.<br>
A scanner is located in the casing 10 of the scanning unit 1. A transparent stationary document bed is laid to define an upper surface of the scanner casing 10. When a<br>
5<br>
 <br>
document is put on the transparent bed, the scanner moves from its start position, to its end position.<br>
Over the scanner casing 10, laid is a resin-made document cover 7 to press a document on the document bed. The cover 7 is able to pivot about a shaft above the scanner casing 10.<br>
An automatic document feeder (ADF) 8 is provided near the pivot shaft of the cover 7, and includes a paper feed portion and surrounding elements. As illustrated in FIG. 1, the ADF 8 is elongated in a direction perpendicular to the movement direction of the scanner. Side frames 7a and 7b of the cover 7 stand near ends of the ADF 8. Between these side frames 7a and 7b, placed is an ADF cover 14 for covering a paper feed portion of the ADF 8. Metallic plates (not shown) are associated with the side frames 7a and 7b such that they stand along the side frames in the vicinity of the ADF cover 14 to support shafts of drive rollers. One or both of the side frames 7a and 7b cover drive/power sources of the drive rollers and associated power transmission parts such as rollers and gears. The document cover 7 is integral with the side frames 7a and 7b and the metallic plates. The document cover 7, side frames 7a, 7b, metallic plates, drive roller power sources and power transmission parts are surrounding elements of the ADF 8. The paper feed portion of the ADF 8 is surrounded by these elements and concealed by the ADF cover 14.<br>
A paper feed tray is provided above the document cover 7 such that it is generally continuous to a paper inlet of the ADF 8. Below the paper feed tray 9 and on the document cover 7, defined is a discharged paper tray 7c such that it is generally continuous to a paper outlet of the ADF 8. The paper outlet opens immediately below the paper inlet. A generally “C” or turned “U” shaped paper path is defined in the ADF 8 from the paper inlet to the paper outlet as best understood.<br>
Fig 2: Figure Showing a ADF Cover Outer Layer.<br>
This figure shows how the ADF Cover Outer will fit into the existing ADF of figure 2.<br>
6<br>
 <br>
Fig 3: ADF Cover with a Locking System<br>
This figure explains a locking mechanism so in case of secure jobs the lock can apply which will prevent the document not to be taken away by anonymous user.<br>
Example scenario: Unlock after job Complete,<br>
1)	Place the documents to be processed in ADF and set the job settings, (releted art)<br>
2)	Manual Step: ADF Cover needs to be attached manually by the user.<br>
3)	The lock ADF option is provided to the MFP via generic user interface say LCD.<br>
4)	If the option is set by the user it sets a corresponding FLAG say LOCKADFTRAY in the MFP to true. Once this FLAG is set to TRUE and an event is sent to the Locking mechanism used to lock the ADF Cover. The locking mechanism thus locks the ADF and its cover.<br>
4a) optional step: The user can set some timeout value say 10 min. The timeout<br>
value gets stored in MFP.<br>
4b) optional step: The user can configure a notification mechanism say email<br>
notification.<br>
5)	After the current job is complete the MFP sets the flag to FLASE.<br>
5a) if a timeout value is set then the MFP will send the event to locking mechanism<br>
only after the timeout value has lapsed.<br>
5b) If a notification mechanism is set then the MFP sends the email notification, so<br>
that the user can come and collect the documents.<br>
Once the Event is received by the Locking mechanism to unlock the ADF Cover, it<br>
unlocks the ADF and its cover.<br>
6)	Thus by the controlled locking mechanism in the ADF the documents can be protected.<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatus can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatus of the present invention as taught by the description and the<br>
7<br>
 <br>
accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a microchip, microprocessor, handheld communication device, computer, rendering device or a multi function device.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart there from.<br>
