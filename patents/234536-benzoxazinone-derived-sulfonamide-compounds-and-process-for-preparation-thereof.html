				<td>The present invention relates to benzoxazinone-derived sulfonamide compounds and process for preparation thereof.<br>
The present invention relates to benzoxazinone-derived sulphonamide compounds of<br>
general formula (1),<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
a process for their preparation, a medicament comprising these compounds and the use of benzoxazlnone-darived sulphonamide compounds for the preparation of medicaments for 5-HT6 receptor regulation as well as for the treatment of disorders related thereto.<br>
The superfamlly of serotonin receptors (5-HT) indudes 7 dasses (5-HTi-S-HT7) encompassing 14 human subclasses [D. Hoyer, et al., Neuropharrnaeotogy, 1997, 38.4191. The 5-HTe receptor Is the latest serotonin receptor identified by molecular efoning both in rats [FJ. Monsma, et al., Mol. Pharmacol., 1993, 43,320; M. Ruat, et al., Brochem, Btophys. Res. Commun., 1993,193,288] and in humans [R. Kohen, et al, J. Neunochem., 1996,66, 47]. Compounds with 5-HT6 receptor affinity are useful for the treatment of various disorders of the Central Nervous System and of the gastrointestinal tract, such as Irritable Intestine syndrome. Compounds with 5-HTg receptor affinity are also useful in the treatment of anxiety, depression and cognitive<br><br>
memory disorders [M. Yoshioka, et a!., Ann. NY Acad. Sci., 1998, 861, 244; A.<br>
Bourson, et al., Br. J. Pharmacol., 1998,125,1562; D.C. Rogers, et al., Br. J.<br>
PharmacoL Suppl., 1999,127, 22P; A. Bourson, et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther.,<br>
1995, 274,173; A.J. Sleight, et al,, Behav. Brain Res., 1996, 73, 245; T.A. Brancliek,<br>
et al., Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol., 2000, 40, 319; C. Routledge, et al., Br. J.<br>
Pharmacol., 2000,130,1606]. It has been shown that typical and atypical<br>
antipsychotic drugs for treating schizophrenia have a high affinity for 5-HTe receptors<br>
[B.L Roth, et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 1994,268,1403; C.E. Glatt, et al., Mol.<br>
Med., 1995,1, 398; F.J. Mosma, et al., Mol. Pharmacol., 1993,43, 320; T. Shinkai,<br>
et al., Am. J. Med. Genet., 1999,88,120]. Compounds with 5-HTe receptor affinity<br>
are useful for treating infant hyperklnesla (ADHD, attention deficit / hyperactivity<br>
disorder) [W.D. Hirst, et al., Br. J. Pharmacol., 2000,130,1597; C. Gerard, et al.,<br>
Brain Research , 1997, 746, 207; M.R. Pranzatelli, Drugs of Today, 1997, 33, 379J.<br>
Moreover, it has been shown that the 5-HT6 receptor also plays a role in food<br>
ingestion [Neuropharmacology, 41, 2001,210-219].<br>
Food ingestion disorders, particularly obesity, are a serious, fast growing threat to the<br>
health of humans of all age groups, since they increase the risk of developing other<br>
serious, even life-threatening diseases such as diabetes or coronary diseases.<br>
Thus, it was an object of the present invention to provide novel compounds that are<br>
suitable in particular as active substances in medicaments, preferably in<br>
medicaments for the regulation of 5-HTe receptors, for cognitive enhancement, for<br>
the prophylaxis and/or treatment of food-intake related disorders, disorders of the<br>
central nervous system, disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, such as irritable<br>
intestine syndrom, anxiety, panic, depression, cognitive memory disorders, senile<br>
dementia disorders, such as Morbus Alzheimer, Morbus Parkinson and Morfous<br>
Huntington, schizophrenia, psychosis, infantile hyperkinesia, ADHC (attention deficit,<br>
hyperactivity disorders) and other 5-HT6 mediated disorders particularly in mammals,<br>
including humans.<br>
It has been found that the benzoxazinone-derived sulphonamide compounds of<br>
general formulas (I), (la) and (Ib) given below show affinity for the 5-HTe-receptor.<br>
These compounds are therefore also suitable for the manufacture of a medicament<br>
for cognitive enhancement, for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of food ingestion<br>
(food intake) disorders, particularly for the regulation of appetite, for the maintenance,<br>
increase or reduction of body weight, for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of obesity,<br>
bulimia, anorexia, cachexia or type II diabetes (Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes<br>
Mellitus), preferably type II diabetes, which is caused by obesity, disorders of the<br>
central nervous system, disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, such as irritable<br>
intestine syndrom, anxiety, panic, depression, cognitive memory disorders, senile<br>
dementia disorders, such as Morbus Alzheimer, Morbus Parkinson and Morbus<br>
Huntington, schizophrenia, psychosis, infantile hyperkinesia, ADHC (attention deficit,<br>
hyperactivity disorders) and other 5-HT6 mediated disorders particularly in mammals,<br>
including man.<br>
Thus, one aspect of the present invention are benzoxazinone-derived sulfonamide<br>
compounds of general formula (I),<br>

the Boc-piperidin-moiety is introduced into the substituted benzylalcohol. The<br>
benzoxazinone-ring is formed by cyclisatlon with triphosgene. The elimination of the<br>
Boc-protecting group is carried out by treatment in acidic media according to the<br>
method described in Williams et al., J. Med. Chem. 1995 38,4634 and later by Bell et<br>

BINDING TO SEROTONIN RECEPTOR 5HT6<br>
Cell membranes of HEK-293 cells expressing the 5HTe-human recombinant receptor<br>
were supplied by Receptor Biology. In said membranes the receptor concentration is<br>
2.18 pmol/mg protein and the protein concentration is 9.17 mg/ml. The experimental<br>
protocol follows the method of B. L. Roth et al. [B. L. Roth, S. C. Craigo, M. S.<br>

The commercial membrane is diluted (1:40 dilution) with the binding buffer: 50 mM<br>
Tris-HCI, 10 mM MgCI2, 0.5 mM EDTA {pH 7.4). The radioligand used Is [3H]-LSD at<br>
a concentration of 2.7 nM with a final volume of 200 μl . incubation is initiated by<br>
adding 100μl of membrane suspension, (= 22.9 μg membrane protein), and is<br>
prolonged for 60 minutes at a temperature of 37 °C. The incubation is ended by fast<br>
filtration in a Brandel Cell Harvester through fiber glass filters made by Schleicher &amp;<br>
Schuell GF 3362 pretreated with a solution of polyethylenimine at 0.5 %. The filters<br>
are washed three times with three mllliliters of buffer Tris-HCI 50 mM pH 7.4. The<br>
filters are transferred to flasks and 5 ml of Ecoscint H liquid scintillation cocktail are<br>
added to each flask. The flasks are allowed to reach equilibrium for several hours<br>
before counting with a Wallac Winspectral 1414 scintillation counter. Non-specific<br>
binding is determined in the presence of 100 μM of serotonin. Tests were made In<br>
triplicate. The inhibition constants (Ki, nM) were calculated by non-linear regression<br>
analysis using the program EBDA/LIGAND described in Munson and Rodbard,<br>

FOOD INTAKE MEASUREMENT (BEHAVIOURAL MODEL):<br>
Male W rats (200-270 g) obtained from Harlan, S.A. are used. The animals are<br>
acclimatized to the animal facility for at least 5 days before they are subjected to any<br>
treatment. During this period the animals are housed (in groups of five) In translucid<br>
cages and provided with food and water ad libitum. At least 24 hours before the<br>
treatment starts, the animals are adapted to single-housing conditions.<br>
The acute effect of the. inventively used sulphonamide derivatives of general formula<br>
(I) on food intake in fasted rats Is then determined as follows:<br>
The rats were fasted for 23 hours in their single homecages. After this period, the rats<br>
are orally or intraperitoneally dosed with a composition comprising a sulphonamide<br>
derivative of general formula (I) or a corresponding composition (vehicle) without said<br>
sulphonamide derivative. Immediately afterwards, the rat is left with preweighed food<br>
and cumulative food intake is measured after 1,2,4 and 6 hours.<br>
Said method of measuring food intake is also described in the literature publications<br>
of Kask et al., European Journal of Pharmacology 414 (2001), 215-224 and of<br>
Turnbull et al., Diabetes, Vol. 51, August 2002. The respective parts of the<br>

The substituted anthranilic acids were reduced by conventional methods known to<br>
those skilled in the art, e.g. by the use of LIAIhU as reducing agent In anhydrous THF<br>
under an inert-gas atmosphere, e.g. argon or nitrogen. This process is very efficient<br>
and in most cases the respective 2-aminobenzylaIcohols are obtained in very good<br>
yields.<br>
General instruction for the reduction of substituted anthranilic acids:<br>
To a three neck flask, equipped with a mechanical stlrrer and an Inlet for gaseous .<br>
nitrogen, 100 ml anhydrous THF and 116,6 mmoles of LIAIhU were given and the<br>
resulting suspension cooled to 0 °C. After the addition of 58,3 mmoles of the<br>
respective substituted anthranilic acid in 150 ml anhydrous THF, the resulting<br>
reaction mixture is warmed to room temperature and stirred or about an hour. Under<br>
cooling to 0° C 4,7 ml water, 4,7 ml NaOH 15 wt-%, and finally 14 mL water are<br>
carefully added to the mixture. The resulting suspension is filtered and washed with<br>
ethyiacetate.<br>
The organic phase is washed with water, dried and the solvent evaporated. In most<br>
cases the resulting product may be used without further purification.<br>
