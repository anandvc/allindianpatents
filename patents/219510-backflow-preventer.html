Translation of PCT/EP2004/003724<br>
Backflow Preventer<br>
The invention relates to a backflow preventer, which can be integrated into a gas or liquid<br>
line and which is provided with a closing body, embodied as a hollow body open at the<br>
drainage side. The closing body limits a passage channel between itself and a central<br>
closing body counterpart, with the closing body being displaceable by the flow medium<br>
flowing through the passage channel from a closing position, contacting the closing body<br>
counterpart in a sealing manner, into an opening position against the restoring force of its<br>
own elasticity and/or own stability.<br>
Such backflow preventers arc inserted into sanitary water lines, for example, in order to<br>
prevent the backflow of water and in particular the return suction of waste water into the<br>
drinking water lines. Such backflow preventers open when the water flows to an outlet.<br>
Here, the closing body is displaced by the flow medium, flowing in the flow direction or<br>
in the direction towards the outlet, from its closed position into the open position against<br>
the restoring force of a return spring. In the event of an undesired backflow, however,<br>
the closing body is pressed firmly against the valve seat and kept in its closing position,<br>
thus blocking the way back for the return flowing water.<br>
The backflow preventers of prior art are usually comparatively complicated and comprise<br>
multiple components, thus they are expensive in their production. Therefore, the object<br>
of the invention is to provide a backflow preventer characterized in a simple construction,<br>
with this simple construction favoring low production costs and operation without<br>
malfunction.<br>
From CH 572 179 Al a backflow preventer of the type mentioned at the outset is known,<br>
which can be inserted into a gas or liquid line. The known backflow preventer is<br>
provided with a cone-shaped closing body on its drainage side which is made from an<br>
elastic material, limiting a passage channel between itself and a central closing body<br>
counterpart. In a closing position the closing body contacts the closing body counterpart<br><br>
215568 649 9<br>
WP 2004/090394	PCT/EP2004/003724<br>
in a sealing manner, which has a cone-shaped exterior contour and is provided<br>
circumference penetrations at its exterior for the fluid flowing through the closing body<br>
counterpart. The closing body, which contacts the closing body counterpart and thus<br>
closes the penetrations in a tightly sealing manner, is displaced by the fluid flowing<br>
through the passage channel in the flow direction against the restoring force of its own<br>
elasticity in the opening position. In contrast thereto, the fluid flowing opposite the flow<br>
direction is able to additionally press the closing body against the exterior circumference<br>
of the closing body counterpart.<br>
The use of such backflow valves in the field of one-lever mixing faucets is frequently<br>
plagued with the problem that during the closing of the cold water or warm water side,<br>
the water, which is enclosed between the closed backflow valve, on the one hand, and the<br>
also closed valve seat, on the other hand, is heated to a large extent by exterior<br>
influences, until system pressure develops which leads to damages in the weakest part of<br>
the supply line and, thus, frequently at the backflow valve. Ultimately, this can lead to a<br>
blockage of the supply line or an also undesired cross-flow.<br>
Due to the fact that the closing body provided in CH 572 179 A5 is pressed more and<br>
more tightly against the exterior circumference of the closing body counterpart by the<br>
pressure of the fluid flowing back against the flow direction, undesired high pressure can<br>
develop in the backflow preventer known from CH 572 179 A5.<br>
Two backflow preventers having a construction to that described in CH 572 179 A5 are<br>
known from DE 1 154 982 B and DE 842 567 C, with their use also being subject to the<br>
disadvantages and risks described above.<br>
Therefore, the object is to particularly provide a backflow preventer of the type<br>
mentioned at the outset, having a simple design which promotes low production costs and<br>
an operation free from malfunctions, with the backflow preventer also effectively<br>
counteracting any excessive increase in interior pressure,<br><br>
2155686499<br>
WP 2004/090394	PCT/EP2004/003724<br>
In particular, the solution to this objective according to the invention provides in the<br>
backflow preventer of the type mentioned at the outset that the closing body, in its<br>
unstressed closing position, initially only contacts with a partial area, embodied as a<br>
sealing lip, a partial or end region of the closing body counterpart, which narrows in a<br>
direction of the flow, and which can be pressed under the stress of the load of fluid<br>
flowing back against the flow direction into a buffer volume for the back flowing fluid at<br>
the drainage side so that it can additionally be pressed with a partial region of its<br>
longitudinal extension against the closing body counterpart.<br>
The closing body of the backflow preventer according to the invention is embodied as a<br>
hollow body, open on the drainage side, and encompassing a central closing body<br>
counterpart. The hollow body initially contacts only with a partial section, embodied as a<br>
sealing lip, a partial or end section of the closing body counterpart, still not subjected to<br>
any strong backflow. Under the stress of the fluid flowing back opposite the flow<br>
direction, the closing body is additionally pressed against the closing body counterpart<br>
with a partial section of its longitudinal extension, blocking the return path of the back<br>
flowing medium. Here, not only is the sealing surface between the closing body and the<br>
closing body counterpart enlarged and the sealing effect effectively increased, also<br>
between the exterior of the closing body pressed towards the closing body counterpart, on<br>
the one hand, and the encompassing interior wall, on the other hand, a buffer volume on<br>
the drainage side is opened for the back flowing fluid, and thus an undesired and<br>
potentially damaging increase in interior pressure is compensated. When the fluid flows<br>
in the flow direction, though, the closing body is displaced by the flowing medium<br>
flowing through the passage channel from its closing position, in which it contacts the<br>
closing body counterpart in a sealing manner, into an opening position against the<br>
restoring force of its own elasticity and/or own stability. Here the closing body and the<br>
closing body counterpart limit a passage channel, in which a gaseous or liquid flow<br>
medium flows in the flow direction or outlet direction.<br>
Therefore, due to the fact that the closing body is embodied as a hollow body and is made<br>
from an inherently elastic material and due to the fact that in the backflow preventer<br><br>
2155686499<br>
WP 2004/090394	PCT/EP2004/003724<br>
according to the invention a displaceablc valve body made from a hard metal can be<br>
omitted, an undesired development of noise is also avoided during the repositioning of<br>
the closing body from the open position into its closed position and pressure waves which<br>
develop by a fast closing of closing members at the drainage side are dampened.   The<br>
pressure wave of backflow preventers of prior art, caused by the fast closing of a closing<br>
member at the drainage side and recognized as a disturbing noise, is reduced and<br>
effectively dampened in the backflow preventer according to the invention by the partial<br>
displacement of the buffer volume provided according to the invention.<br>
In order for the closing body to be able to execute the high number of opening and<br>
closing motions following in rapid sequence it is advantageous for the closing body to be<br>
produced from an elastic material. In order for the medium, flowing back at high<br>
pressure, not to be able to displace the closing body counterpart beyond the narrowing<br>
section, it is advantageous for the sealing lip to be provided, at its free edge region<br>
contacting the closing body counterpart, with a reinforcement at the edge which<br>
counteracts a widening of the circumference of the edge region.<br>
The reinforcement of the edge can be embodied as an annular and non-stretchable<br>
material inlay in the closing body edge region, for example. The simple production of<br>
the backflow preventers according to the invention is promoted, though, when the edge<br>
reinforcement is embodied as a circumferential, cross-sectional expansion or cross-<br>
sectional enlargement of the closing body.<br>
A preferred embodiment according to the invention provides for the closing body to have<br>
a rounded end region and to be embodied preferably in a drop-shaped manner. In this<br>
embodiment the high throughput and the little loss in pressure of the backflow preventer<br>
according to the invention is favored even more.<br>
In order to hold the closing body counterpart in the desired central position inside the<br>
closing body, embodied as a hollow body, it is advantageous for the central closing body<br><br>
2155686499<br>
WP 2004/090394	PCT/EP2004/003724<br>
counterpart to be connected to a through flow plate, provided with flow openings which<br>
open into the passage channel.<br>
The through flow plate, in the area of the passage channel, is characterized in a flow<br>
resistance being as little as possible, when the through flow plate is embodied in the area<br>
of the passage channel as a sieve or perforated plate with flow openings embodied<br>
preferably honcycomb-shaped.<br>
The simple production of the backflow preventer according to the invention is favored<br>
even more, when the through flow plate and the closing body counterpart are connected<br>
to one another in one piece.<br>
An embodiment according to the invention which is produced in a particularly simple and<br>
cost-effective manner, provides for the closing body to be held to the exterior<br>
circumference of the through flow plate.<br>
In order to be able to produce the backflow preventer according to the invention with<br>
little expense and from only few components it is advantageous for the closing body with<br>
its closing body section held to the through flow plate to contact the interior<br>
circumference of the gas or liquid pipeline. In this embodiment a separate annular seal<br>
can be omitted. Instead of such an annular seal, the closing body performs the function<br>
with its closing body section contacting the interior circumference of the gas or liquid<br>
line.<br>
In order to enhance such sealing function even further it is advantageous for the edge<br>
region of the face of the closing body, contacting upstream the gas or liquid line in a<br>
sealing manner, is embodied as a circumferentially extending cross-sectional<br>
enlargement. Here, a particularly advantageous further development according to the<br>
invention provides for the closing body to be held with its cross-sectional enlargement in<br>
a holding groove provided at the exterior circumference of the through flow plate.<br><br>
2155686499<br>
WP 2004/090394	PCT/EP2004/003724<br>
The reduced production expense is enhanced even further when the backflow preventer is<br>
essentially formed in two parts and the closing body, on the one hand, is provided both<br>
with a closing body counterpart and, on the other hand, with the through flow plate<br>
connected thereto in a single piece.<br>
Additional features of the invention are discernible from the following description of an<br>
embodiment according to the invention in connection with the claims and the drawing.<br>
The individual features can be embodied alone or combined in an embodiment according<br>
to the invention.<br>
In the drawings:<br>
Fig. 1: a backflow preventer, which can be inserted into a gas or liquid pipeline, shown in<br>
a cross section, in its original or closed position not subjected to any flow medium<br>
Fig. 2: the backflow preventer according to Fig. 1, with the backflow preventer is shown<br>
in its closed position on the left of the central axis and in its open position on the<br>
right of the central axis, and<br>
Fig. 3: a top view of the backflow preventer according to Figs. 1 and 2 on a through flow<br>
plate provided upstream.<br>
In Figs. 1 through 3 the backflow preventer is shown, which can be inserted into a gas or<br>
liquid line, and here it is integrated in a sanitary water line 2. The backflow preventer 1<br>
is provided with a closing body 3 embodied as an essentially pot-shaped hollow body<br>
open at the drainage side.<br>
As clearly discernible from the closed or normal position of the backflow preventer 1,<br>
shown in Fig. 1 unimpinged by the flow medium, the closing body 3 limits a passage<br>
channel 5 between itself and a central closing body counterpart 4.<br><br>
2155686499<br>
WP 2004/090394	PCT/EP2004/003724<br>
In the left half of Fig. 2 it is shown how the closing body 3, made from an elastic or<br>
shape-elastic material is additionally defined in the closed position by the back flowing<br>
flow medium impinging the closing body 3 on its exterior, causing a large partial section<br>
of its longitudinal extension to be pressed against the closing body counterpart 4. Here,<br>
the closing body contacts the closing body counterpart 4 under the pressure of the fluid<br>
flowing back opposite the flow direction such that between the closing body and the<br>
encompassing interior wall of the pipeline a downstream buffer volume is opened for the<br>
back flowing fluid. By opening the downstream buffer volume, any undesired increase in<br>
interior pressure is compensated, which otherwise might damage the gas or liquid<br>
pipeline and/or the functional unit integrated therein. Across therefrom, the backflow<br>
preventer 1 is shown in the right half of Fig. 2 in its opening position. Here it is obvious<br>
that the dosing body 3 can be displaced by the flow medium flowing in the flow<br>
direction Pfl through the passage channel 5 from a closed position, contacting a closing<br>
body counterpart 4 in a sealing fashion, into an open position against the restoring force<br>
of its own elasticity or its own stability.<br>
In Figs. 1 and 2 it is discernible that the closing body counterpart 4 made from a<br>
dimensionally stable material, has an end region, which narrows in the flow direction Pfl<br>
in a rounded fashion, here. For this purpose, the closing body counterpart 4 is embodied<br>
essentially drop-shaped. Here, the closing body counterpart 4 is connected in one piece<br>
with the upstream tip of a drop-shaped through flow plate 7, aligned laterally to the flow<br>
direction Pfl, which contacts with its edges at least one rest, here embodied as an annular<br>
flange 8, in the gas or liquid line 2.<br>
It is possible for at least one feeder channel to be penetrated by the closing body<br>
counterpart 4, which opens into the passage channel 5. However, here the through flow<br>
plate 7 is provided with penetrating openings 9, that open into the passage channel 5.<br>
From the top view onto the upstream face of the through flow plate 7, shown in Fig. 3, it<br>
is discernible that in the area of the passage channel, said blow plate is embodied as a<br>
sieve or perforated plate with preferably honeycomb-shaped penetrating holes 9.<br><br>
2155686499<br>
WP 2004/090394	PCT/EP2004/003724<br>
The closing body 3 is held to the exterior circumference of the through flow plate 7.<br>
Here, the closing body 3 contacts with its closing body section, held to the through flow<br>
plate 7, the interior circumference of the gas or liquid pipeline 2 in such a sealing manner<br>
that any additional annular seal between the backflow preventer 1 and the gas or liquid<br>
pipeline 2 can be omitted.<br>
In order to improve the sealing effect of the closing body 3 in this area even more, the<br>
edge region of the face of the closing body 3, upstream contacting the gas or liquid line 2<br>
in a sealing manner, is embodied as an annular-shaped encircling cross-sectional<br>
enlargement 10. Here, it is discernible in Figs. 1 and 2 that the closing body 2 is held<br>
with its cross-sectional enlargement 10 to a mounting groove 11 provided at the exterior<br>
circumference of the through flow plate 7.<br>
At its downstream partial region, the closing body 3 is embodied as a narrowed and<br>
rounded scaling lip 12, which contacts the end region 6 of the closing body counterpart 4.<br>
In order for the closing body 3 to additionally be pressed against the closing body<br>
counterpart 4, serving as a valve seat, by the flow medium impinging it from the outside<br>
and flowing in the opposite flow direction Pf2, and thus also preventing the edge region<br>
of the closing body 3, contacting the closing body counterpart 4 with the edge region<br>
from being pushed by the high pressure of back flowing medium, over the tapering end<br>
section 6 of the closing body counterpart 4, the scaling lip 12 is provided at its free edge<br>
region contacting the closing body counterpart 4 with an edge reinforcement 13<br>
counteracting any expansion of the edge region circumference. This edge reinforcement<br>
13 is here embodied as a circumferentially extending cross-sectional expansion or cross-<br>
sectional enlargement of the closing body 3.<br>
The closing body 3 of the backflow preventer 1 shown here is embodied as a hollow body<br>
open at the drainage side, encompassing the central closing body counterpart 4. The<br>
closing body 3 and the closing body counterpart 4 define between each other the passage<br>
channel 5 through which a gaseous or liquid flow medium flows in the flow direction or<br>
towards the outlet Pf 1. Here, the closing body 3 is displaced by the flow medium<br><br>
2155686499<br>
WP 2004/090394	PCT/EP2004/003724<br>
flowing through the passage channel 5 from the closing position, sealing at the closing<br>
body counterpart 4, against the restoring force of its own elasticity and/or own stability<br>
into its opening position. However, in the event of backflow of the flow medium in the<br>
opposite direction Pf2, the closing body 3, impinged on the outside by the back flowing<br>
medium, is held in its closing position, which blocks the backward flow of the back<br>
flowing medium.<br>
A particular advantage of the backflow preventer 1 shown here is the fact that it can be<br>
produced inexpensively and from very few components. The backflow preventer 1<br>
shown here is embodied in two components and essentially comprises, on the one hand,<br>
the closing body counterpart 4 connected in one piece to the through flow plate 7 and, on<br>
the other hand, the closing body 3. The backflow preventer shown here is characterized<br>
in a high flow capacity and a comparatively low pressure loss.<br><br>

CLAIMS<br>
1.	Backflow preventer (1), which can be inserted into a gas or liquid line (2),<br>
comprising a closing body (3) embodied as a hollow body open on a drainage<br>
side, which limits a passage channel (5) between the closing body and a central<br>
closing body counterpart (4), the closing body (3) being displaceable by a flow<br>
medium flowing through the passage channel (5) in a flow direction (Pf 1) from a<br>
closed position, contacting the closing body counterpart (4) in a sealing manner<br>
into an open position against a restoring force of an elasticity and/or a stability of<br>
the closing body, characterized in that the closing body (3), in an unstressed<br>
closed position, initially contacts only a partial or edge region (6) of the closing<br>
body counterpart (4) with a partial region embodied as a sealing lip (12) of the<br>
closing body and can additionally be pressed against the closing body counterpart<br>
(4) with a partial region of a longitudinal extension thereof under a pressure of the<br>
fluid flowing against the flow direction (Pf 1), opening a downstream buffer<br>
volume for back flowing fluid.<br>
2.	A backflow preventer according to claim 1, characterized in that a free edge<br>
region of the sealing lip (12), which contacts the closing body counterpart (4), is<br>
provided with an edge reinforcement (13) to compensate against expansion of an<br>
edge region circumference.<br>
3.	A backflow preventer according to one of claims 1 or 2, characterized in that the<br>
edge reinforcement (13) is embodied as an annular cross-sectional expansion or a<br>
cross-sectional enlargement of the closing body (3).<br>
4.	A backflow preventer according to one of claims 1 through 3, characterized in<br>
that the closing body counterpart (4) has a rounded end section (6) and is<br>
preferably embodied in a drop shaped manner.<br>
The invention relates to a backflow preventer (1) integrateable into a gas or liquid pipeline (2). The inventive backflow preventer consists of a closing body (3) which is embodied in the form of a hollow body which is open on a drainage side thereof and defines a passage channel (5) between itself and the central counterpart (4) opposite thereto. Said closing body (3) is displaceable by a flow medium flowing through the passage channel (5) in a flow direction (Pf 1) from a sealing contact thereof with said counter part (4) of the closing body to the open position thereof against the opposing force of elasticity and /or stability thereof. Said backflow preventer (1) is easily producible even with a small number of components and is characterised by a high flow and low pressure loss.</td>
