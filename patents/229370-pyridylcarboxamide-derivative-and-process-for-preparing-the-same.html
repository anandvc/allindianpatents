The invention relates to 3-pyridylcarboxamide derivatives and their use for the control of pests, in particular arthropods such as insects and acarids, and helminths (including nematodes); to compositions containing them, and to processes and Intennediates for their preparation.<br>
The control of insects, nematodes or helminths with 3-pyridylcarboxamide compounds has been described in many patents such as EP 580374, JP 10101648, JP 10182625, WO 200109104, WO 200114340, JP 6321903, JP 10195072 and JP 11180957.<br>
However, the level of action and/or duration of action of these prior-art compounds is not entirely satisfactory in all fields of apphcation, in particular against certain organisms or when low concentrations are apphed.<br>
Since modern pesticides must meet a wide range of demands, for example regarding level, duration and spectrum of action, use spectrum, toxicity, combination with other active substances, combination with formulation auxiharies or synthesis, and since the occurrence of resistances is possible, the development of such substances can never be regarded as concluded, and there is constantly a high demand for novel compounds which are advantageous over the known compounds, at least as far as some aspects are concerned.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide compounds which widen the spectrum of the pesticides in various aspects.<br>

Collections of compounds of the formula (I) which can be synthesized by the above mentioned process may also be prepared in a parallel manner, and this may be effected manually or in a semiautomated or fully automated manner. In this case, it is possible, for example, to automate the procedure of the reaction, work-up or purification of the products or of the intermediates. In total, this is to be understood as meaning a procedure as is described, for example, by S.H. DeWitt in "Annual Reports in Combinatorial Chemistry and Molecular Diversity: Automated Synthesis", Volume 1, Verlag Escom 1997, pages 69 to 77.<br>
A series of commercially available apparatuses as are offered by, for example. Stem Corporation, Woodrolfe Road, Tollesbury, Essex, CM9 8SE, England or H+P Labortechnik GmbH, Bruckmannring 28, 85764 Oberschleihheim, Germany or Radleys, Shirehill, Saffron Walden, Essex, England, may be used for the parallel procedure of the reaction and work-up. For the parallel purification of compounds of the formula (I), or of intermediates obtained during the preparation, use may be made, inter aha, of chromatography apparatuses, for example those by ISCO, Inc., 4700 Superior Street, hncoln, NE 68504, USA.<br><br>
The apparatuses mentioned lead to a modular procedure in which tine individual process steps are automated, but manual operations must be performed between the process steps. This can be prevented by employing semi-integrated or fully integrated automation systems where the automation modules in question are operated by, for example, robots. Such automation systems can be obtained, for example, from Zymark Corporation, Zymark Center, Hopkinton, MA 01748, USA.<br>
In addition to what has been described here, compounds of the formula (I) may be prepared in part or fully by sohd-phase-supported methods. For this purpose, individual intermediate steps or all intermediate steps of the synthesis or of a synthesis adapted to suit the procedure in question are bound to a synthetic resin. Sohd-phase-supported synthesis methods are described extensively in the speciahst hterature, for example Barry A. Bunin in "The Combinatorial Index", Academic Press, 1998.<br>
The use of sohd-phase-supported synthesis methods permits a series of protocols which are known from the hterature and which, in turn, can be performed manually or in an automated manner. For example, the "tea-bag method" (Houghten, US 4,631,211; Houghten etal., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, 1985, 82, 5131-5135), in which products by iRORl, 11149 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA, are employed, may be semiautomated. The automation of sohd-phase-supported parallel syntheses is performed successfully, for example, by apparatuses by Argonaut Technologies, Inc., 887 industrial Road, San Carlos, CA 94070, USA or MultiSynTech GmbH, Wullener Feld 4, 58454 Witten, Germany.<br>

According to a further feature of the present invention there is provided a method for the control of pests at a locus which comprises the apphcation of an effective amount of a compound of formula (I) or a salt thereof. For this purpose, the said compound is normally used in the form of a pesticidal composition (i.e. in association with compatible diluents or carriers and/or surface active agents suitable for use in pesticidal compositions), for example as hereinafter described.<br>
The term "compound of the invention" as used hereinafter embraces a 3-pyhdylcarboxamide of formula (!) as defined above and a pesticidally acceptable salt thereof.<br>
One aspect of the present invention as defined above is a method for the control of pests at a locus. The locus Includes, for example, the pest itself, the place (plant, field, forest, orchard, waterway, soil, plant product, or the hke) where the pest resides or feeds, or a place susceptible to future infestation by the pest. The compound of the invention may therefore be apphed directly to the pest, to the place where the pest resides or feeds, or to the place susceptible to future infestation by the pest.<br><br>
As is evident from the foregoing pesticidal uses, the present invention provides pesticidaily active compounds and methods of use of said compounds for the control of a number of pest species which includes: arthropods, especially insects or mites, or plant nematodes. The compound of the invention may thus be advantageously employed in practical uses, for example, in agricultural or horticultural crops, in forestry, in veterinary medicine or hvestock husbandry, or in pubhc health. The compounds of the invention may be used for example in the following apphcations and on the following pests:<br>
For the control of soil insects, such as corn rootworm, termites (especially for protection of structures), root maggots, wireworms, root weevils, stall<borers cutworms root aphids or grubs. they may also be used to provide activity against plant pathogenic nematodes such as root-knot cyst dagger lesion stem bulb mites. for the control of soil pests example corn rootworm compounds are advantageously apphed incorporated at an effective rate into in which crops planted seeds growing roots.></borers>
In the area of pubhc health, the compounds are especially useful in the control of many insects, especially filth fhes or other Dipteran pests, such as housefhes, stablefhes, soldierfhes, hornfhes, deerfhes, horsefhes, midges, punkies, blackfhes, or mosquitoes.<br>
In the protection of stored products, for example cereals, including grain or flour, groundnuts, animal feedstuffs, timber or household goods, e.g. carpets and textiles, compounds of the invention are useful against attack by arthropods, more especially beetles, including weevils, moths or mites, for example Ephestia spp. (flour moths), Anthrenus spp. (carpet beetles), Tribohum spp. (flour beetles), Sitophilus spp. (grain weevils) or Acarus spp. (mites).<br>
In the control of cockroaches, ants or termites or similar arthropod pests in infested domestic or industrial premises or in the control of mosquito larvae in waterways, wells, reservoirs or other running or standing water.<br>

Against arthropods of agricultural significance such as Acari (mites) e.g, Acarus siro, Argas spp., Ornithodoros spp., Dermanyssus galhnae, Eriophyes ribis, Phyllocoptruta oleivora, Boophilus spp., Rhipicephalus spp., Amblyomma spp., Hyalomma spp., Ixodes spp., Psoroptes spp., Chorioptes spp., Sarcoptes spp., Tarsonemus spp., Bryobia praetiosa, Panonychus spp., Tetranychus spp., Eotetranychus spp., Ohgonychus spp., Eutetranychus spp. From the order of the Isopoda, for example, Oniscus aselus, Armadium vulgare, Porcelho scaber.<br>
Against nematodes which attack plants or trees of importance to agriculture, forestry or horticulture either directly or by spreading bacterial, viral, mycoplasma or fungal diseases of the plants. The plant-parasitic nematodes which can be controlled in accordance with the invention include, for example, the root-parasitic soil-dwelhng nematodes such as, for example, those of the genera Meloidogyne (root knot nematodes, such as Meloidogyne incognita, Meloidogyne hapla and Meloidogyne javanica), Heterodera and Globodera (cyst-forming nematodes, such as Globodera rostochiensis, Globodera palhda, Heterodera trifohi) and of the genera Radopholus, such as Radopholus simihs, Pratylenchus such as Pratylenchus neglectus, Pratylenchus penetrans and Pratylenchus curvitatus;<br><br>

In practical use for the control of arthropods, especially insects or acarids, or nematode pests of plants, a method, for example, comprises applying to the plants or to the medium in which they grow an effective amount of a compound of the invention. For such a method, the compound of the invention is generally apphed to the locus in which the arthropod or nematode infestation is to be controlled at an effective rate in the range of about 2g to about 1 kg of the active compound per hectare of locus treated. Under ideal conditions, depending on the pest to be controlled, a lower rate may offer adequate protection. On the other hand, adverse weather conditions, resistance of the pest or other factors may require that the active ingredient be used at higher rates. The optimum rate depends usually upon a number of factors, for example, the type of pest being controlled, the type or the growth stage of the infested plant, the row spacing or also the method of apphcation. Preferably an effective rate range of the active compound is from about lOg/ha to about 400g/ha, more preferably from about 50g/ha to about 200 g/ha. When a pest is soil-borne, the active compound generally in a formulated composition, is distributed evenly over the area to be treated (ie, for example broadcast or band treatment) in any convenient manner and is apphed at rates from about 10g/ha to about 400g ai/ha, preferably from about 50g/ha to about 200 g ai/ha. When apphed as a root dip to seedhngs or drip irrigation to plants the hquid solution or suspension contains from about 0.075 to about 1000 mg ai/1, preferably from about 25 to about 200 mg ai/1. Apphcation may be made, if desired, to the field or crop-growing area generally or in close proximity to the seed or plant to be protected from attack. The compound of the invention can be washed into the soil by spraying with water over the area or can be left to the natural action of rainfall. During or after apphcation, the formulated compound can, if desired, be distributed mechanically in the soil, for example by ploughing, disking, or use of drag chains. Apphcation can be prior to planting, at planting, after planting but before sprouting has taken place, or after sprouting.<br>
The compound of the invention and methods of control of pests therewith are of particular value in the protection of field, forage, plantation, glasshouse, orchard or vineyard crops, of ornamentals, or of plantation or forest trees, for example: cereals (such as wheat or rice), cotton, vegetables (such as peppers), field crops (such as<br><br>
sugar beets, soybeans or oil seed rape), grassland or forage crops (such as maize or sorghum), orchards or groves (such as of stone or pit fruit or citrus), ornamental plants, flowers or vegetables or shrubs under glass or in gardens or parks, or forest trees (both deciduous and evergreen) in forests, plantations or nurseries. They are also valuable in the protection of timber (standing, felled, converted, stored or structural) from attack, for example, by sawflies or beetles or termites. They have apphcations in the protection of stored products such as grains, fruits, nuts, spices or tobacco, whether whole, milled or compounded into products, from moth, beetle, mite or grain weevil attack. Also protected are stored animal products such as skins, hair, wool or feathers in natural or converted form (e.g. as carpets or textiles) from moth or beetle attack as well as stored meat, fish or grains from beetle, mite or fly attack.<br>
Additionally, the compound of the invention and methods of use thereof are of particular value in the control of arthropods or helminths which are injurious to, or spread or act as vectors of diseases domestic animals, for example those hereinbefore mentioned, and more especially in the control of ticks, mites, hce, fleas, midges, or biting, nuisance or myiasis fhes. The compounds of the invention are particularly useful in controlhng arthropods or helminths which are present inside domestic host animals or which feed in or on the skin or suck the blood of the animal, for which purpose they may be administered orally, parenterally, percutaneously or topically.<br>
The compositions hereinafter described for apphcation to growing crops or crop growing loci or as a seed dressing may, in general, alternatively be employed in the protection of stored products, household goods, property or areas of the general environment. Suitable means of applying the compounds of the invention include: to growing crops as fohar sprays (for example as an in-fun-ow spray), dusts, granules, fogs or foams or also as suspensions of finely divided or encapsulated compositions as soil or root treatments by hquid drenches, dusts, granules, smokes or foams; to seeds of crops via apphcation as seed dressings by hquid slurries or dusts;<br>
to animals infested by or exposed to infestation by arthropods or helminths, by parenteral, oral or topical apphcation of compositions in which the active ingredient<br><br>
exhibits an immediate and/or prolonged action over a period of time against the arthropods or helminths, for example by incorporation in feed or suitable orally-ingestible pharmaceutical formulations, edible baits, salt hcks, dietary supplements, pour-on formulations, sprays, baths, dips, showers, jets, dusts, greases, shampoos, creams, wax smears or hvestocl
to the environment in general or to specific locations where pests may lurk, including stored products, timber, household goods, or domestic or industrial premises, as sprays, fogs, dusts, smokes, wax-smears, lacquers, granules or baits, or in tricklefeeds to waterways, wells, reservoirs or other running or standing water.<br>
The compounds of the formula (I) can also be employed for controlhng harmful organisms in crops of known genetically engineered plants or genetically engineered plants yet to be developed. As a rule, the transgenic plants are distinguished by especially advantageous properties, for example by resistances to particular crop protection agents, resistances to plant diseases or pathogens of plant diseases, such as particular insects or microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria or viruses. Other particular properties concern, for example, the harvested material with regard to quantity, quahty, storage properties, composition and specific constituents. Thus, transgenic plants are known where the starch content is increased, or the starch quahty is altered, or where the harvested material has a different fatty acid composition.<br>
The use in economically important transgenic crops of useful plants and ornamentals is preferred, for example of cereals such as wheat, barley, rye, oats, millet, rice, cassava and maize or else crops of sugar beet, cotton, soya, oilseed rape, potatoes, tomatoes, peas and other types of vegetables.<br>
When used in transgenic crops, in particular those which have resistances to insects, effects are frequently observed, in addition to the effects against harmful organisms to be observed in other crops, which are specific for apphcation in the transgenic crop in question, for example an altered or specifically widened spectrum of pests<br><br>
which can be controlled, or altered apphcation rates which may be ennployed for<br>
apphcation.<br>
The invention therefore also relates to the use of compounds of the formula (1) for controlhng harmful organisms in transgenic crop plants.<br>
According to a further feature of the present invention there is provided a pesticidal composition comprising one or more compounds of the invention as defined above, in association with, and preferably homogeneously dispersed in one or more compatible pesticidally acceptable diluents or carriers and/or surface active agents [i.e. diluents or carriers and/or surface active agents of the type generally accepted in the art as being suitable for use in pesticidal compositions and which are compatible with compounds of the invention].<br>
in practice, the compounds of the invention most frequently form parts of compositions. These compositions can be employed to control arthropods, especially insects and acarids, or helminths such as plant nematodes. The compositions may be of any type known in the art suitable for apphcation to the desired pest in any premises or indoor or outdoor area. These compositions contain at least one compound of the invention as the active ingredient in combination or association with one or more other compatible components which are for example, sohd or hquid carriers or diluents, adjuvants, surface-active-agents, or the hke appropriate for the intended use and which are agronomically or medicinally acceptable. These compositions, which may be prepared by any manner known in the art, hkewise form a part of this invention.<br>
The compounds of the invention, in their commercially available formulations and in the use forms prepared from these formulations may be present in mixtures with other active substances such as insecticides, attractants, sterilants, acaricides, nematicides, fungicides, growth regulatory substances or herbicides.<br>
The pesticides include, for example, phosphoric esters, carbamates, carboxyhc esters, formamidines, tin compounds and materials produced by microorganisms.<br><br>

The abovementioned components for combinations are known active substances, many of which are described in Ch.R Worthing, S.B. Walker, The Pesticide Manual, 12* Edition, British Crop Protection Council, Farnham 2000.<br>
The effective use doses of the compounds employed in the invention can vary within wide hmits, particularly depending on the nature of the pest to be ehminated or degree of infestation, for example, of crops with these pests. In general, the compositions according to the invention usually contain about 0.05 to about 95% (by weight) of one or more active ingredients according to the invention, about 1 to about 95% of one or more sohd or hquid carriers and, optionally, about 0.1 to about 50% of one or more other compatible components, such as surface-active agents or the hke. In the present account, the term "carrieR4 denotes an organic or inorganic ingredient, natural or synthetic, with which the active ingredient is combined to facihtate its apphcation, for example, to the plant, to seeds or to the soil. This carrier is therefore generally inert and it must be acceptable (for example, agronomically acceptable, particularly to the treated plant).<br>
The carrier may be a sohd, for example, clays, natural or synthetic sihcates, sihca, resins, waxes, sohd fertihzers (for example ammonium salts), ground natural minerals, such as kaohns, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite, bentonite or diatomaceous earth, or ground synthetic minerals, such as sihca, alumina, or sihcates especially aluminium or magnesium sihcates. As sohd carriers for granules the following are suitable: crushed or fractionated natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiohte and dolomite; synthetic granules of inorganic or<br><br>
organic meals; granules of organic material such as sawdust, coconut shells, corn cobs, corn husks or tobacco stalks; kieselguhr, tricalcium phosphate, powdered cork, or absorbent carbon black; water soluble polymers, resins, waxes; or sohd fertihzers. Such sohd compositions may, if desired, contain one or more compatible wetting, dispersing, emulsifying or colouring agents which, when sohd, may also serve as a diluent.<br>
The carrier may also be hquid, for example: water, alcohols, particularly butanol or glycol, as well as their ethers or esters, particularly methylglycol acetate; ketones, particularly acetone, cyclohexanone, methylethyl ketone, methyhsobutylketone, or isophorone; petroleum fractions such as paraffinic or aromatic hydrocarbons, particularly xylenes or alkyl naphthalenes; mineral or vegetable oils; ahphatic chlorinated hydrocarbons, particularly trichloroethane or methylene chloride; aromatic chlorinated hydrocarbons, particularly chlorobenzenes; water-soluble or strongly polar solvents such as dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulphoxide, or N-methylpyrrohdone; hquefied gases; or the hke or a mixture thereof. The surface-active agent may be an emulsifying agent, dispersing agent or wetting agent of the ionic or non-ionic type or a mixture of such surface-active agents. Amongst these are e.g., salts of polyacryhc acids, salts of hgnosulphonic acids, salts of phenolsulphonic or naphthalenesulphonic acids, polycondensates of ethylene oxide with fatty alcohols orfatty acids or fatty esters or fatty amines, substituted phenols (particularly alkylphenols or arylphenols), salts of sulphosuccinic acid esters, taurine derivatives (particularly alkyltaurates), phosphoric esters of alcohols or of polycondensates of ethylene oxide with phenols, esters of fatty acids with polyols, or sulphate, sulphonate or phosphate functional derivatives of the above compounds. The presence of at least one surface-active agent is generally essential when the active ingredient and/or the inert carrier are only shghtly water soluble or are not water soluble and the carrier agent of the composition for apphcation is water. Compositions of the invention may further contain other additives such as adhesives or colorants. Adhesives such as carboxymethylcellulose or natural or synthetic polymers in the form of powders, granules or lattices, such as arable gum, polyvinyl alcohol or polyvinyl acetate, natural phosphohpids, such as cephahns or lecithins, or synthetic phosphohpids can be used in the formulations. It is possible to use<br><br>
colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example: iron oxides, titanium oxides or Prussian Blue; organic dyestuffs, such as ahzarin dyestuffs, azo dyestuffs or metal phthalocyanine dyestuffs; or trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum or zinc.<br>
For their agricultural apphcation, the compounds of the invention are therefore generally in the form of compositions, which are in various sohd or hquid forms. Sohd forms of compositions which can be used are dusting powders (with a content of the compound of the invention, ranging up to 80%), wettable powders or granules (including water dispersible granules), particularly those obtained by extrusion, compacting, impregnation of a granular carrier, or granulation starting from a powder (the content of the compound of the invention, in these wettable powders or granules being between about 0.5 and about 80%). Sohd homogenous or heterogenous compositions containing one or more compounds of the invention, for example granules, pellets, briquettes or capsules, may be used to treat standing or running water over a period of time. A similar effect may be achieved using trickle or intermittent feeds of water dispersible concentrates as described herein. hquid compositions, for example, include aqueous or non-aqueous solutions or suspensions (such as emulsifiable concentrates, emulsions, flowables, dispersions, or solutions) or aerosols. hquid compositions also include, in particular, emulsifiable concentrates, dispersions, emulsions, flowables, aerosols, wettable powders (or powder for spraying), dry flowables or pastes as forms of compositions which are hquid or intended to form hquid compositions when apphed, for example as aqueous sprays (including low and ultra-low volume) or as fogs or aerosols. hquid compositions, for example, in the form of emulsifiable or soluble concentrates most frequently comprise about 5 to about 80% by weight of the active ingredient, while the emulsions or solutions which are ready for apphcation contain, in their case, about 0.01 to about 20% of the active ingredient. Besides the solvent, the emulsifiable or soluble concentrates may contain, when required, about 2 to about 50% of suitable additives, such as stabihzers, surface-active agents, penetrating agents, corrosion inhibitors, colorants or adhesives. Emulsions of any required concentration, which are particularly suitable for apphcation, for example, to plants, may be obtained from these concentrates by dilution with water. These<br><br>
compositions are included within the scope of the connpositions which may be employed in the present invention. The emulsions may be in the form of water-in-oil or oil-in-water type and they may have a thick consistency. The hquid compositions of this invention may, in addition to normal agricultural use apphcations be used for example to treat substrates or sites infested or hable to infestation by arthropods (or other pests controlled by compounds of this invention) including premises, outdoor or indoor storage or processing areas, containers or equipment or standing or running water.<br>
All these aqueous dispersions or emulsions or spraying mixtures can be apphed, for example, to crops by any suitable means, chiefly by spraying, at rates which are generally of the order of about 100 to about 1,200 hters of spraying mixture per hectare, but may be higher or lower (eg. low or ultra-low volume) depending upon the need or apphcation technique. The compound or compositions according to the invention are conveniently apphed to vegetation and in particular to roots or leaves having pests to be ehminated. Another method of apphcation of the compounds or compositions according to the invention is by chemigation, that is to say, the addition of a formulation containing the active ingredient to irrigation water. This irrigation may be sprinl<ler irrigation for fohar pesticides or it can be ground underground soil systemic pesticides.></ler>
The concentrated suspensions, which can be apphed by spraying, are prepared so as to produce a stable fluid product which does not settle (fine grinding) and usually contain from about 10 to about 75% by weight of active ingredient, from about 0.5 to about 30% of surface-active agents, from about 0.1 to about 10% of thixotropic agents, from about 0 to about 30% of suitable additives, such as anti-foaming agents, corrosion inhibitors, stabihzers, penetrating agents, adhesives and, as the carrier, water or an organic hquid in which the active ingredient is poorly soluble or insoluble Some organic sohds or inorganic salts may be dissolved in the carrier to help prevent setthng or as antifreezes for water.<br>
The wettable powers (or powder for spraying) are usually prepared so that they contain from about 10 to about 80% by weight of active ingredient, from about 20 to about 90% of a sohd carrier, from about 0 to about 5% of a wetting agent, from about 3 to about 10% of a dispersing agent and, when necessary, from about 0 to about<br><br>
80% of one or more stabihzers and/or other additives, such as penetrating agents, adhesives, anti-caking agents, colorants, or the hke. To obtain these wettable powders, the active ingredient is thoroughly mixed in a suitable blender with additional substances which may be impregnated on the porous filler and is ground using a mill or other suitable grinder. This produces wettable powders, the wettabihty and the suspendabihty of which are advantageous. They may be suspended in water to give any desired concentration and this suspension can be employed very advantageously in particular for apphcation to plant fohage. The "water dispersible granules (WG)" (granules which are readily dispersible in water) have compositions which are substantially close to that of the wettable powders. They may be prepared by granulation of formulations described for the wettable powders, either by a wet route (contacting finely divided active ingredient with the inert filler and a httle water, e.g. 1 to 20% by weight, or with an aqueous solution of a dispersing agent or binder, followed by drying and screening), or by a dry route (compacting followed by grinding and screening).<br>
The rates and concentrations of the formulated compositions may vary according to the method of apphcation or the nature of the compositions or use thereof. Generally speaking, the compositions for apphcation to control arthropod or helminth pests usually contain from about 0.00001 % to about 95%, more particularly from about 0.0005% to about 50% by weight of one or more compounds of the invention, or of total active ingredients (that is to say the compounds of the invention, together with other substances toxic to arthropods or helminths, synergists, trace elements or stabihzers). The actual compositions employed and their rate of apphcation will be selected to achieve the desired effect(s) by the farmer, hvestock producer, medical or veterinary practitioner, pest control operator or other person skilled in the art. Sohd or hquid compositions for apphcation topically to animals, timber, stored products or houslehold goods usually contain from about 0.00005% to about 90%, more particularly from about 0.001 % to about 10%, by weight of one or more compounds of the invention. For administration to animals orally or parenterally, including percutaneously sohd or hquid compositions, these normally contain from about 0.1 % to about 90% by weight of one or more compounds of the invention. Medicated feedstuffs normally contain from about 0.001% to about 3% by weight of<br><br>
one or more compounds of the invention. Concentrates or supplements for mixing with feedstuffs normally contain from about 5% to about 90%, preferably from about 5% to about 50%, by weight of one or more compounds of the invention. Mineral salt hcks normally contain from about 0.1 % to about 10% by weight of one or more compounds of formula (I) or pesticidally acceptable salts thereof. Dusts or hquid compositions for apphcation to hvestock, goods, premises or outdoor areas may contain from about 0.0001% to about 15%, more especially from about 0.005% to about 2.0%, by weight, of one or more compounds of the invention. Suitable concentrations in treated waters are between about 0.0001 ppm and about 20 ppm, more particularly about 0.001 ppm to about 5.0 ppm. of one or more compounds of the invention, and may be used therapeutically in fish farming with appropriate exposure times. Edible baits may contain from about 0.01% to about 5%, preferably from about 0.01 % to about 1.0%, by weight, of one or more compounds of the invention.<br>
When administered to vertebrates parenterally, orally or by percutaneous or other means, the dosage of compounds of the invention, will depend upon the species, age, or health of the vertebrate and upon the nature and degree of its actual or potential infestation by arthropod or helminth pests. A single dose of about 0.1 to about 100 mg, preferably about 2.0 to about 20.0 mg, per kg body weight of the animal or doses of about 0.01 to about 20.0 mg, preferably about 0.1 to about 5.0 mg, per kg body weight of the animal per day, for sustained medication, are generally suitable by oral or parenteral administration. By use of sustained release formulations or devices, the daily doses required over a period of months may be combined and administered to animals on a single occasion.
