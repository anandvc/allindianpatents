				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to somatostatin analog peptides and encompasses the novel peptides that are agonists to somatostatin and their potential use for the treatment of cancer. The invention particularly relates to the design and synthesis of the novel analogs of somatostatin incorporating a,a-dialkylated amino acids in a site specific manner. The invention encompasses methods for generation of these peptides, compositions containing the peptides and the pharmacological applications of these peptides especially in the treatment and prevention of cancer.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Somatostatin (SST) is a widely distributed peptide occurring in two forms SST-14 (with 14 ammo acids) and SST-28 (with 28 amino acids). It was originally isolated from the hypothalamus and characterized by Guillemin et al. and is described in U.S.Pat. No. 3,904,594 (Sep. 9, 1975). Somatostatin is found in the gut, pancreas, the nervous system, various exocrine and endocrine glands through the body and in most organs. In normal subjects somatostatin has a broad spectrum of biological activities. It participates in a large number of biological processes where it has the role of an inhibitory factor. It inhibits the release of insulin, prolactin, glucagaon, gastrin, GH, Thyroid stimulating hormone, secretin and cholecystokinin. (S.Reichlm: Somatostatin, N.Eng. J. Med.,309, 1495 and 1556, 1983.)<br>
The mechanism of action of somatostatin is mediated by high affinity membrane associated receptors. Five somatostatin receptors (SSTR1-5) are known. (Reisme, T;Bell,G.I; Endocrine reviews, 1995,16, 427-42 ) All five receptors are heterogeneously distributed and pharmacologically distinct. Somatostain receptors have been found to be over-expressed in a wide range of tumors, those arising in the brain (including meningioma, astrocytoma, neuroblastoma, hypophysical adenoma, paraganglioma, Merkel cell carcinoma, and gliomas), the digestive-pancreatic tract (including insulinoma, gluconoma, AUODoma, VIPoma, and colon carcinoma), lung, thyroid, mammary gland, prostate, lymphatic system (including both Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas),and ovaries.<br>
One of the most important effects of somatostatin are its growth-inhibiting ability and its capability to influence pathological cell growth It is well known that it exerts an inhibitory effect on the growth of cancer cells both directly and by its antagonizing action on growth factors associated with malignant growth [A V Serially ,Cancer Res.,48,6977,(1988), Taylor, et al Biochem , Biophys Res Commun , 153, 81 (1988)] It has been shown by recent investigations that somatostatin and some somatostatin analogues are capable of activating the tyrosine phosphatase enzyme which antagonizes the effect of tyrosine kinases playing a very important role in the tumorous transformation [A V Schally Cancer Res 48, 6977 (1988)] The importance of tyrosine kinases is supported by the fact that the majority of oncogenes code for tyrosine kinase and the major part of the growth factor receptors is tyrosine kinase [Yarden et al Ann Rev Biochem 57, 443 (1989)]<br>
Native somatostatin has a very short or transient effect in vivo since it is rapidly inactivated by endo- and exopeptidases A large number of novel analogues have been synthesized in order to increase its plasma half life and biological activity Most of the active analogues contain a disulphide bond and a peptide chain shorter than the original one The first cyclic hexapeptide showing the whole effects of somatostatin was synthesized by Veber et al [Nature, 292, 55 (1981)] As a continuation newer and more effective cyclic hexa- and octapeptides have been synthesized which possess the whole spectrum of effects of somatostatin [Veber et al, Life Sci 34, 1371 (1984), Murphy et al , Biochem Biophys Res Commun 132, 922 (1985), Cai et al , Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 83, 1896(1986)]<br>
In spite of the high rates of over expression of somatostatin receptors on a variety of tumors, somatostatin analogues have not gained widespread clinical application for the control of cancer Their current clinical application is primarily in the control of symptoms associated with metastatic carcinoid or VIP-secreting tumors The somatostatin analogues have a wide therapeutic index and seem to be free of major side effects Most of the side effects are gastrointestinal in nature and include minor nausea, bloating, diarrhea, constipation, or steatorrhea Part of the reason for the restricted clinical use may be due to the need for long-term maintenance therapy, the consequent high cost of such therapy, and the variable effects observed in clinical settings<br>
Somatostatin analogues, preparation of such analogues, and uses for such analogues are known in the prior art Such analogues are used in the treatment of certain cancers and other conditions One commercially available product, octreotide, D-Phe-Cys-Phe-D-Trp-Lys-Thr-Cys-Thr-ol (disulphide bridge between the Cys residue), manufactured by Sandoz, and sold under the trade name Sandostatin, is being used clinically to inhibit tumour growth and and as a diagnostic agent to detect somatostain receptor expressing tumours Of the five receptor sub-types, octreotide and other clinically used somatostatin analogs interact significantly with three of the receptor subtypes, SSTR2, SSTR3 and SSTR5 SSTR2 and SSTR5 have recently been reported to mediate anti-proliferative effects of somatostatin on tumour cell growth, and may therefore mediate the effects of octreotide in humans<br>
A wide variety of somatostatin analogues have been developed These include RC-160, a potent somatostatin analogue originally synthesized by a team at Tulane University headed by Andrew V Schally (Cai R Z, Szoke B, Lu E, Fu D, Redding T W and Schally A V. Synthesis and biological activity of highly potent octapeptide analogues of somatostatin Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 83 1896-1900, 1986) In recent studies conducted by Schally, among others, the effectiveness of RC-160 in inhibiting the growth of human glioblastomas in vitro and in vivo has been demonstrated (Pinski J, Schally A V, Halmos G, Szepeshazi K and Groot K Somatostatin analogues and bombesin/gastrin-releasing peptide antagonist RC-3095 inhibit the growth of human glioblastomas in vitro and in vivo Cancer Res 54 5895-5901, 1994)<br>

The aim of the present invention is to synthesize novel somatostatin analogs showing a more advantageous and more selective biological action in comparison to that of known compounds The invention is based on the use of a,a-dialkylated amino acids in the octapeptide analog of somatostatin at position 6 These amino acids are known for inducing conformational constraint. The design of conformationaily constrained bioactive peptide derivatives has been one of the most widely used approaches for the development of peptide-based therapeutic agents Non-standard amino acids with strong conformational preferences may be used to direct the course of polypeptide chain folding, by imposing local stereochemical constraints, in de novo approaches to peptide design The conformational characteristics of a, a-dialkylated amino acids have been well studied The incorporation of these amino acids restricts the rotation of  angles, within the molecule, thereby stabilizing a desired peptide conformation The prototypic member of a,a-dialkylated aminoacids, a-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) or α,α-dimethylglycine has been shown to induce p-turn or helical conformation when incorporated in a peptide sequence [Prasad, BVV and Balaram,P CRC Crit RevBiochem 16,307-347 (1984), Karle,IL and Balaram,P. Biochemistry 29, 6747-6756, (1990)] The conformational properties of the higher homologs of a,a-dialkylated amino acids such as di-ethylglycine (Deg), di-n-propylglycine (Dpg) and di-n-butylglycine (Dbg) as well as the cyclic side chain analogs of a,a-dialkylated amino acids such as 1-aminocyclopentane carboxylic acid (Ac5c), 1-aminocyclohexane carboxylic acid (Ac6c), 1-aminocycloheptane carboxylic acid (Ac7c) and 1-aminocyclooctane carboxylic acid (Ac8c) have also been shown to induce folded conformation [Prasad,S et al, Biopolymers 35, 11-20 (1995) , KarleJ  L et al, J Amer Chem Soc 117,9632-9637(1995)1 α,α-Dialkylated amino acids have been used in the design of highly potent chemotactic peptide analogs (Prasad, S et al, Int J Peptide Protein Res 48, 312-318,(1996)]<br>
The present invention exploits the conformational properties of a, a-dialkylated amino acids for the design of biologically active peptide derivatives, taking somatostatin as the model system under consideration The invention is directed to somatostatin analogs containing a, a-dialkylated<br>
amino acids A further object of the invention is the synthesis of somatostatin analogs containing α,α-dialkylated amino acids The inventors have also synthesized peptide derivatives having N-terminal alkanoyl groups of from C2 to C18 carbon atoms which retains anti cancer activity In the present invention, we have also synthesized peptide derivatives having N-terminal alkanoyl groups from C2- C18 carbon atoms, which retain anticancer activity A still further object of the invention is the preparation of the analogs by solid phase peptide synthesis methodology It has been shown that lipophilazation of bioactive peptides improves their stability, bioavailability and the ability to permeate biomembranes (Dasgupta ,P et al, 1999, Pharmaceutical Res 16, 1047-1053; Gozes,I et al, 1996, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 93, 427-432)<br>

Synthesis of peptides<br>
The novel peptide analogs embodied in the present invention contain amino acids, namely α,α dialkylated amino acids, which are known to induce highly specific constraints in the peptide backbone   The α,α dialkylated amino acids were synthesized from the appropriate ketones These ketones were first converted into their corresponding hydantoins, which on hydrolysis with strong acid or alkali gave the respective amino acids<br>
The novel peptides of the present invention can be made by exclusively, solid phase techniques, by a combination of solution phase procedures and solid phase techniques, or, by fragment condensation These methods for the chemical synthesis of polypeptides are well known in the art (Stewart and Young, 1969) Preferred, semi-automated, stepwise solid phase methods for synthesis of peptides of the invention are provided in the examples discussed in a subsequent section of this document The applicants are also not aware of any prior art describing the synthesis of the novel somatostatin analogs incorporatingα,α-dialkylated amino acids, as encompassed in the present invention<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the peptides were synthesized using Fmoc strategy, either manually, or on a semi- automatic peptide synthesizer (CS Bio, Model 536), using optimum side chain protection The peptides were assembled from Oterminus to N-terminus Peptides amidated at the carboxy-terminus were synthesized using the Rink Amide resin The loading of the first Fmoc protected amino acid was achieved via an amide bond formation with the solid support, mediated by Diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIPCDI) and HOBt   Substitution levels for<br>
automated synthesis were preferably between 0 2 and 0 8 mmole amino acid per gram resin   The steps involved in the synthesis of the somatostatin analogs employed the following protocol<br>
TABLE I<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
The resin employed for the synthesis of carboxy-terminal amidated peptide analogs was 4-(2', 4'-<br>
Dimethoxyphenyl-Fmoc-aminomethyl)-phenoxymethyl-derivatized	polystyrene	1 %<br>
divinylbenzene  (Rink  Amide)  resin  (100-200   mesh),   procured  from  Advanced   Chemtech, Louisville, KY, U S A, (0 7 milli equivalent NH sub 2 /g resin)<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention the following chemical moieties were used to protect reactive side chains of the peptides during the synthesis procedure<br>
The N-terminal amino group was protected by 9-flourenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) group  The tryptophan residue was either left unprotected or used with Boc protection The side chain amino<br>
group of Lysine and Ornithine was protected using Boc group, preferrably Threonine and Tyrosine residues were used with t-Butyl (t-Bu) protection Trityl or Acetamidomethyl (Acm) were the preferred protecting groups for Cysteine and Penicillamine was preferrably protected with the Acetamidomethyl (Acm) group.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, 2-8 equivalents of Fmoc protected amino acid per resin nitrogen equivalent was used The activating reagents used for coupling amino acids to the resin, in solid phase peptide synthesis, are well known in the art These include BOP, PyBOP, HBTU, TBTU, PyBOP, HOBt Preferably, DCC or DIPCDI / HOBt or HBTU/HOBT and DIEA were used as activating reagents in the coupling reactions The protected amino acids were either activated m situ or added in the form of pre-activated esters known in the art such as NHS esters, Opfp esters etc The coupling reaction was carried out in DMF, DCM or NMP or a mixture of these solvents and was monitored by Kaiser test [Kaiser et al, Anal Biochem, 34, 595-598 (1970)] In case of a positive Kaiser test, the appropriate amino acid was re-coupled using freshly prepared activated reagents<br>
After the assembly of the peptide chain was completed, disulfide bond formation was either carried out on-resin, where the Acm side-chain protecting groups were removed using Iodine in Dimethylformamide, and the free thiol groups thus generated were oxidized simultaneously to yield the cyclized peptide This was followed by the removal of the amino- terminal Fmoc group using steps 1-6 of the above protocol The peptide-resin was then washed with methanol and dried Where post- cleavage disulphide formation was carried out, the N- terminal Fmoc group was removed and the peptide was cleaved from the resin support by treatment with a cleavage mixture consisting of trifluoroacetic acid, ethanedithiol and de-ionized water for lto 4 hours at room temperature Normally, the cleavage mixture also simultaneously removed the side-chain protecting groups, except for the side-chain protecting Acm groups that were not removed by the above procedure The crude peptide was obtained by precipitation with cold dry ether, filtered, dissolved, and lyophilized Where disulfide formation was carried out on the crude Acm-protected peptide, the Acm group was removed by any of the known methods such as using Thallium trifluoroacetate, iodine etc<br>
The resulting crude peptide was purified by preparative high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a LiChroCART® C18 (250 Times 10) reverse phase column (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) on a Preparative HPLC system (Shimadzu Corporation, Japan) using a gradient of 0 1% TFA in acetonitrile and water The eluted fractions were reanalyzed on Analytical HPLC system (Shimadzu Corporation, Japan) using aC18 LiChrospher®, WP-300 (300 X 4) reverse- phase column Acetonitrile was evaporated and the fractions were lyophilized to obtain the pure peptide The identity of each peptide was confirmed by mass spectra<br>
The present invention will be further described in detail with reference to the following examples, as will be appreciated by a person skilled in the art, is merely illustrative, and should not be construed as limiting Various other modifications of the invention will be possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention<br>

A typical preparation of the Fmoc-Thr-Rink Amide Resin was carried out using 0 5g of 4-(2',4'-Dimethoxyphenyl- Fmoc- aminomethyl) phenoxymethyl- derivatized polystyrene 1% divinylbenzene (Rink Amide ) resin, (0.7 milliequivalent NH sub 2 /g resin), (100-200 mesh), procured from Advanced Chemtech, Louisville, KY, U.S.A.Swelling of the resin was typically carried out in dichloromethane measuring to volumes 10-40ml /g resin The resin was allowed to swell in methylene chloride (2 X 25 ml, for 10 min ) It was washed once in dimethylformamide (DMF) for 1 min All solvents in the protocol were added in 20 ml portions per cycle The Fmoc-protecting group on the resin was removed by following steps 3-7 in the protocol The deprotection of the Fmoc group was checked by the presence of blue beads in Kaiser test For loading of the first amino acid on the free amino (NH2) group of the resin, the first amino acid was weighed in three to six fold excess in the amino acid vessel of the peptide synthesizer This was dissolved in dimethylformamide (ACS grade) (J T Baker, Phillipsburg, New Jersey, US A ) and activated with DIPCDI, just prior to the addition to the resin in the reaction vessel of the<br>
peptide synthesizer For difficult couplings, alternative BOP/DTEA, HBTU/DIEA couplings were carried out The coupling reaction was carried out for a period ranging from 1-3 hours The loading of the amino acid on the resin was confirmed by the presence of colorless beads in the Kaiser Test Recoupling was carried out for incomplete reactions The loading efficiency was ascertained by the increase of weight of the resin after the addition of the amino acid<br>
The peptide sequence was assembled by subsequent deprotection and coupling cycles, as mentioned earlier in the protocol<br>
The synthesis Qf SEQ.ID NO 1 was started on 0 5s scale Upon completion of synthesis and<br>
removal of the N-terminaT Tmoc protecting group (steps l-o of the synthesis cycle), the peptide-<br>
resin was washed twice with methanol, dried and weighed to obtain 0 694g This was subjected to<br>
cleavage in a cleavage mixture consisting of trifluoroacetic acid and scavengers, ethanedithol and<br>
water for a period of 1-4 hours at room temperature with continuous stirring  The peptide was<br>
precipitated using cold dry ether to obtain 172mg of the crude peptide<br>
Disulfide bond formation in the crude peptide was carried out in Iodine in methanol (3X to 12X molar excess of iodine for 5 min to lhr) and excess of Iodine was removed with sodium thiosulfate or ascorbic acid or extraction with CCl4 after evaporation of methanol on rotavapour<br>
The crude, cyclised peptide was purified on a C18 preparative reverse phase HPLC column (250X10) on a gradient system comprising of acetonitrile and water in 0 1% TFA as described previously. The prominent peak was collected and lyophilized, reanalysed on analytical HPLC and subjected to mass spectrometry There was a good agreement between the observed molecular weight and calculated molecular weight (Calculated mass = -1073 , Observed Mass= 1074.1 ) The pure peptide was then used for bioassay<br>
