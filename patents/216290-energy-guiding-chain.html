				<td>The present invention relates to a energy guiding chain for guiding hoses, cables and the like between two connection points relatively movable with respect to each other, said chain comprising a straight lower strand followed by a curved section and a self-supporting upper strand, with several chain straps   which   are   connected   to    one   another   via   upper   and   lower crossmembers   in   detachable   fashion   and   assembled   into   two   parallel strands, and which overlap one another and can be angled around axes of rotation, where chain straps designed as inner straps with inner overlap areas  and  as outer straps with outer overlap areas alternate with one another in each chain strand, and where the inner and outer straps are respectively opposite to one another in the parallel chain strands, and where stops each having first stop surfaces and, respectively, for restricting the bending of the curved section and second stop surfaces for restricting the bending of the self-supporting section of the upper strand are provided in the overlap areas of adjacent chain strands, and where the stop surfaces of the inner straps are positioned asymmetrically with respect to mirroring at the centre plane, containing the axes of rotation, characterised in that the stop surfaces of the outer straps are positioned asymmetrically with respect to mirroring at the centre plane such that in case of a change of the ori¬entation of 180° either of the inner straps or of the outer straps around the centre axis running in the middle between the two axes of rotation and parallel thereto the self-supporting section of the upper strand and/or the curved section of the chain obtains a different curvature.<br><br>
In the case of horizontally arranged energy guiding chains, the movement of the chain initially brings about the formation of a roughly straight section known as the lower strand. This section rests on a base, such as a guide channel, or also on the floor. The lower strand is followed by a curved section. The at least partially self-supporting section of the chain following the curved section is known as the upper strand. In addition to the radius of curvature of the chain in the curved section, the curvature of the upper strand is also of particu¬lar importance in the use of energy guiding chains.<br>
In energy guiding chain applications, chains are used which have upper strands in various positions depending on the length of the travel path, the load and other conditions. In this context, a distinction is made between chains with a self-supporting upper strand and chains with a sliding upper<br>
strand. In the case of a self-supporting upper strand, the energy guiding chain is freely suspended above the lower strand and the floor. The curvature of the self-supporting upper strand can vary. The superelevation of the upper strand in the self-supporting section is referred to as pretension. The upper strand of a self-supporting chain can also be straight or sagging. In the case of a sliding upper strand, the energy guiding chain is bent through much more than 180° in the curved section, so that the upper strand rests on the lower strand after a certain distance. In chains with a slid¬ing upper strand, the distance after which the upper strand rests on the lower strand or the floor is determined by the curvature of the upper strand. In order to prevent the sliding upper strand of a chain from flying up due to the tensile and transverse forces occurring during travel in combination with possible unevenness in the slide rail or in the lower strand on which the upper strand slides, the upper strand is not under pretension in the case of long travel paths.<br>
The bending behaviour of the energy guiding chain is essen¬tially determined by the arrangement of the stops, and the weight of the chain and the lines contained inside.<br>
Energy guiding chains of this kind are known from DE 43 25 259 Al. The chains consist of chain straps connected to one another in detachable fashion by cross-members. The chain straps assembled to form a strand can be angled with respect to one another. In this context, the inner straps and outer straps represent the different types of chain straps. The types differ by, among other things, the arrangement of the overlap areas where they are linked to one another in a manner permitting angling. Based on two chain strands arranged paral¬lel to one another which form a guide cavity, the inner straps/outer straps are those chain straps which are mounted on the inside/outside in the overlap area. Stops are provided in the overlap areas of the chain straps to restrict the ang¬ling of the chain straps relative to one another. In this context, the stops in the outer straps are positioned symmet<br>
rically with respect to the centre axis running in the longi¬tudinal direction of the chain as the axis of symmetry. The stops in the inner straps are positioned asymmetrically with respect to the longitudinal direction of the chain.<br>
A disadvantage of the known energy guiding chains is that different inner and outer straps must respectively be provided for different curvatures of the curved section and of the self-supporting section of the upper strand, this increasing the manufacturing and stock-keeping costs.<br>
In reference to this prior art, the invention is based on the task of providing energy guiding chains with different radii of curvature and different upper strand paths, which are simple and economical to manufacture.<br>
According to the invention, the task is solved in that the stops of the inner and outer straps are positioned asym¬metrically with respect to the centre axis running in the longitudinal direction of the chain as the axis of symmetry, such that the limits of the angling motion defined by the stops vary, depending on the orientation of one of these straps with, respect to the longitudinal direction of the chain.<br>
The two orientations of a chain strap with respect to the longitudinal direction of the chain refer to the positions of the strap in the longitudinal direction of the chain which arise when the strap is rotated through 180° about the centre axis of the strap running transverse to the longitudinal di¬rection of the chain.<br>
If the stops of both types of chain straps are positioned asymmetrically in accordance with the invention, the range of angles through which the chain straps can be angled relative to one another depends on the orientation of the straps with respect to the longitudinal direction of the chain. In this context, there are two different possibilities for the orien-<br>
tation of the strap with respect to the longitudinal direction of the chain. A chain strand with a specific radius of curva¬ture and a specific upper strand path can be converted into a chain strand with a different path by changing the orientation of the straps with respect to the longitudinal direction of the chain by switching the inner or outer straps in the chain strand. Due to the asymmetrical position of the stops, the two orientations result in different angle ranges for angling the chain straps relative to one another.<br>
An advantage of the energy guiding chain according to the invention is that two different types of bending behaviour can be realised for the energy guiding chain using the same inner and outer straps. The prior art required at least three dif¬ferent straps to achieve the same effect.<br>
In a preferred configuration of the energy guiding chain ac¬cording to the invention, the stops in the overlap areas are positioned mirror-symmetrically with respect to the centre axis of the chain straps running perpendicular to the longi¬tudinal direction of the chain. As a result of this design, the straps opposite one another in the chain strands can each consist of identically designed inner and outer straps, this reducing the manufacturing and assembly costs. Furthermore, this offers the advantage that the identical inner and outer straps positioned opposite one another in the two chain strands ensure optimum straight running of the chain.<br>
The stops of the inner and outer straps can be positioned such that the self-supporting section of the upper strand exhibits a different path, depending on the orientation of one of these straps with respect to the longitudinal direction of the chain.<br>
In a preferred configuration, the stops in the inner and outer straps are positioned such that the curvature of the self-supporting section of the upper strand is defined by the ori¬entation of the outer strap. For example, an energy guiding<br>
chain with a self-supporting, straight upper strand can be converted into a chain with a self-supporting, sagging upper strand. A self-supporting upper strand can also be converted into a sliding upper strand, for example. Similarly, energy guiding chains are possible whose upper strand exhibits high or low pretension, depending on the orientation of the outer strap. One advantage of using the outer strap to define the path of the upper strand is that it is easily accessible for changing the orientation with respect to the longitudinal direction of the chain. In order to change the orientation, the outer strap detached from the chain strand need only be rotated through 180° about the centre axis running transverse to the longitudinal direction of the chain and reinserted in the chain strand. If the stops are not excessively asymmetri¬cal, the resultant change in the radius of curvature in the section between the lower strand and the upper strand lies within the range of permissible tolerances.<br>
The chain straps on the outer sides of the chain strands are provided with at least one marking in order to facilitate manipulation and accurate determination of the orientation of the chain straps. Thus, the orientation of the straps can always be determined from the relative position of the marking of the inner strap and the outer strap.<br>
The angling of the chain strap can be expediently restricted by double-acting stops. With a double-acting stop, two pairs of stop surfaces are provided in each case in order to re¬strict angling in both directions,•thus resulting in greater stability of the energy guiding chain.<br>
The invention is described below based on a practical example illustrated in the associated drawings. The drawings show the following:<br>
Fig. 1 A section of a self-supporting upper strand of an energy guiding chain under pretension,<br>
Fig. 2  An inner strap of the chain section shown in Fig. 1, Fig. 3  An outer strap of the chain section shown in Fig. 1,<br>
Fig. 4  A cut-out of the chain section shown in Fig. 1 with two outer straps and one inner strap,<br>
Fig. 5  A curved section of a self-supporting upper strand of an energy guiding chain,<br>

Fig. 7  An inner strap of the chain section shown in Fig. 5, and<br>
i<br>
Fig. 8  A cut-out of the chain section shown in Fig. 5 with two outer straps and one inner strap.<br>
As the drawings show, particularly Figs. 1 and 5, energy guid¬ing chain 1 consists of several chains straps 2 connected to form strands. In a chain strand, inner straps 3 and outer straps 4 alternate with one another and are connected in over¬lap areas 5 in a manner such that they can be angled.<br>
Inner strap 3, illustrated in Figs. 2 and 7, exhibits a round projection 6 in overlap area 5. Inner strap 3 is connected to outer strap 4 by locating round projection 6 in round recess 7 of overlap area 5 of outer strap 4.<br>
The figures show that inner strap 3 and outer strap 4 are mirror-symmetrical with respect to centre axis SI running perpendicular to longitudinal direction of the chain S2. In both chain strands, chain'straps 2 are each used after rota¬tion through an angle of 180° about axis SI.<br>
Each overlap area 5 of inner strap 3 exhibits two stop sur¬faces 8 and 9 of different orientation. In this context, the first stop surface 8 is parallel to longitudinal direction of<br>
the chain S2. Stop surface 9 encloses an angle with longitudi¬nal direction of the chain S2. The two stop surfaces 8 and 9 are connected to one another via ribs 10, which serve to stabilise stop surfaces 8 and 9.<br>
Similar to projection 6, stop surfaces 8 and 9 protrude out of overlap area 5 of inner strap 3. Web 11, separating overlap areas 5, can also protrude out of the inner strap.<br>
Outer strap 4 is provided with two stop surfaces 12 and 13 arranged in different positions. As Figs. 3 and 6 show, stop surface 13 is parallel to longitudinal direction of the chain S2 in this context. Stop surface 12 encloses an angle with longitudinal direction of the chain S2. In order to stabilise stop surfaces 12 and 13, they are connected to one another by way of wall 14 delimiting round recess 7. Outer strap 4 also has a web 15 separating the two overlap areas 5.<br>
If inner and outer straps 3 and 4 are assembled as illustrated in Fig. 4, the angling of the chain straps relative to one another is achieved by the interaction of stop surfaces 9 and 13, or by stop surfaces 8 and 12. Stop surfaces 8, 9, 12 and 13 are designed as double-acting stops, in that two of them respectively act together in pairs.<br>
The angle of energy guiding chain 1 in the curved section is determined by the meeting of surfaces 9 and 13. The figures show that, as a result of the parallel position of stop sur¬face 13 in relation to longitudinal direction of the chain S2, the angle in the curved section of the energy guiding chain is determined by the angle of stop surface 9 to longitudinal direction of the chain S2 .<br>
If inner and outer straps 3 and 4 are angled as illustrated in Fig, 4, the limit of the angle is defined by the interaction of stop surf ace's 8 and 12 . The figures show that straps 3 and 4 in the selected orientation result in a chain strand whose upper strand is under pretension. As stop surface 8 is paral-<br>
le1 to longitudinal direction of the chain S2, the path of the upper strand is essentially determined by the angle of incli¬nation of stop surface 12 with respect to longitudinal direc¬tion of the chain S2.<br>
If outer strap 4 is inserted into inner strap 3 in the other orientation, as shown in Fig. 5, the latter must be rotated through 180° about centre axis S3 in the plane of the drawing, which is perpendicular to axes S1 and S2. In order to more easily determine the orientation of inner and outer straps 3, 4, they are provided with markings 16 and 17 on the sides visible from the outside.<br>
If inner and outer straps 3 and 4 are assembled in the orien¬tation illustrated in Fig. 8, the limits of the angle are defined by the orientation of stop surfaces 12 and 9, or 13 and 8 .<br>
In this context, the orientation of the two stop surfaces 9 and 12 determines the radius of the curved section of energy guiding chain 1. Due to the small angle of inclination of stop surface 12 relative to longitudinal direction of the chain S2, the limiting angle in the curved section is slightly smaller than in the other corresponding orientation of outer strap 4. As the angle of stop surface 12 to the parallel is only slight, the change in the radius of curvature is minimal and thus tolerable.<br>
The orientation of stop surfaces 8 and 13 restricts the ang¬ling of two chain straps in the opposite direction. This de¬termines the curvature of the self-supporting section of the upper strand. The parallel orientation of stop surfaces 8 and 13 with respect to longitudinal direction of the chain S2 indicates that the upper strand has a geometrically straight path. Due to the forces of weight of the chain straps, and of the cables, hoses and the like guided inside the chain, acting on the upper strand, and due to the elastically flexible plas¬tic material of straps 2, this orientation of stop surfaces 8<br>
and 13 results in a self-supporting, curved upper strand, as illustrated in Fig. 8.<br>
