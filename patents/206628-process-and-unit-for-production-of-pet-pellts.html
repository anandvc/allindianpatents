				<td>Description<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the production of granules from polyfunctional carboxylic acids and alcohols, in particular PET granules, wherein terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol after their esterificatien and a prepolycondensstion are filtered as a low viscosity precondensaten granulated and passed to a solid phase polyeondervsation and are then available as Highly viscous partially crystalline granules- As is known-i PET denotes poly,(ethylene terephthalate) -<br>
Such a process for the production of PET granules is known-i in which the precondensate formed by the esterification and prepolycondensation of ethylene glycol (E6&gt; and terephthalic acid (PTA) is passed to a reactor operating under reduced pressure in order on the one hand to increase the viscosity of the predominantly liquid and short-chain polymer n and on the other hand to recycle the released ethylene glycol to the esterification. After the reactor treatment the polycondensate that is formed is cooled with demineralised water and chopped into granules so as to form cylindrical pellets-i which on the one hand are predominantly amorphous and on the other hand have projections on their cut ends that tend to break off during transportation and intermediate storage-) thereby producing dust- Before these pellets are available for processing in for example extruders o&gt; they have to be partially crystallised in a separate process stage-* following which they are subjected to a solid phase polycondensation under the addition of nitrogen- A further crystallisation and increase in viscosity is thereby achieved-! with the result that highly viscous pellets are finally available.   This<br><br>
known process is however disadvantageous for various reasons- In the first place it is a disadvantage that the pellets tare present in a predominantly amorphous state after their granulation and accordingly have to fee partially crystallised in a subsequent separate treatment stage- Xn addition the projections in the region of the cut ends of the amorphous pellets readily break off during their transportation and storage and consequently tend to produce dust- Furthermore the expenditure on apparatus at\fi energy is a disadvantage sinc"i special treatment stages SPQ necessary-, such as the reactor stage operating under reduced pressure and a partial crystallisation stage-Besides this there is a significant need for desiineralised water for the granulation of the precondensate-<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a process whereby granules formed from polyfunctional tarboxylic acids anti alcohols -" in particular PET granules*! can be produced economically and conveniently as roundi dust-free pellets of uniform size ant! satisfactory quality in a solidified and partially crystallised modification with reduced expenditure on apparatus and energy. A further object of the invention is to provide an apparatus for carrying out the aforementioned process that is characterised by a simple and function-oriented design and construction.<br>
This object is achieved by the invention in a generic process^ characterised in that for the purposes of the granulation the molten precondensate is added to a trickling tower with a heated distribution trickling nozzle arranged at the head of the trickling tower-, that the precondensate leaves the distribution trickling nozzle with the formation of droplet-shaped pellets and the pellets arm blasted 1 after a predetermined free falling height-i by a hot stream of nitrogen in countercurrent with a reduction of  the  falling  velocity  and  acceleration  of  a<br><br>
-3-<br>
crystallisation with increasing degree of crystallisation-, and that the pellets leaving at the floor of the trickling tower are passed as dried and partially crystallised pellets to the solid phase polycondensation. As a result of these features of the invention the precondensate is converted by means of the distribution trickling nozzle into droplet-shaped and consequently round pellets-t and more specifically over practically the whole cross-section of the tower- In fact^ the formation of filaments is prevented with the aid of the distribution trickling nozzle. An outer skin already forms during the free falling trajectory. A further consolidation of the pellets is achieved by means of the nitrogen countercurrent. This nitrogen countercurrent can readily be adjusted so that no interfering turbulences occur-, and instead simply the falling velocity of the pellets is reduced and as a result of the nitrogen blasting a partial crystallisation is simultaneously achieved- By means of the nitrogen countercurrent the residence time of the pellets in the trickling tower can be adjusted so that the pellets are at the same time sufficiently dried and are converted into uniform drops and consequently uniformly round pellets of satisfactory quality- Surprisinglyi such a consolidation of the pellets is achieved over the free falling height and due to the blasting with nitrogen in countercurrentt that the latter do not adhere to one another even if-" by means of the distribution trickling nozzlei droplet-shaped pellets are produced in an increasingly dense distribution over the cross-section of the trickling tower and fall down the tower. The round and substantially consolidated as well as partially crystallised pellets can be transported and stored without virtually any formation of dust and-, in particular having regard to their uniform size-i can also uniformly polycondense in the solid phase polycondensation. As a result high quality granules formed from polyfunctional carboxylic acids and alcohols-, in particular PET pellets-, can be produced conveniently and economically<br><br>
by the process according to the invention. This is achieved without any treatment in a reactor operating under reduced pressure and without cooling with demineralised water and the adoption of granulation measures that lead to the formation of cylindrical pellets having a tendency to produce dusti and finally without any partial crystallisation in a separate process stage-, since according to the teaching of the invention partially crystallised pellets with a predetermined degree of crystallisation are produced to start withi instead of mainly largely amorphous pellets- As a result the expenditure on apparatus and energy for the production of the pellets according to the invention can also be significantly reduced-<br>
Further essential features according to the invention are discussed hereinafter. For examplei the invention envisages that the pellets in the trickling tower are subjected in an upper stage and a lower stage to a nitrogen countercurrent in order to achieve a residence time as long as possible and consequently high partial crystallisation and/or consolidation of the round pellets without interfering turbulence. Insteadn the process is carried out with a stepwise reduction of the falling velocity and acceleration of the partial crystallisationi with a constant increase in the degree of crystallisation-Preferably the nitrogen is fed in through the floor region of the trickling tower and the two nitrogen countercurrent stages are generated by a stepwise extraction of nitrogen-In this way different blasting velocities in the upper and lower stages can be achieved- The pellets &amp;re conveniently blasted in countercurrent in the upper stage at a velocity of 1 to 3 m/sec-i and in the lower stage at a velocity of 3 to ? m/sec- To this end dry nitrogen at a temperature of XfeO°C to 25Q°C is fed to the trickling tower- Both features lead to an increase not only of the partial crystallisation but also of the viscosity of the pellets and consequently<br><br>
their solidification- The nitrogen extracted from the trickling tower can be passed to an ethylene glycol separator and a nitrogen drier in order to recycle the recovered ethylene glycol to the esterification stage-, and more specifically without using an otherwise extremely costly reactor and without having to carry out an uneconomic elimination of the ethylene glycol in the course of a catalytic combustion-<br>
The subject of the invention is also an apparatus for carrying out the claimed process-! including at least one esterification  staget  a  prepolycondensation  stagei  a filtration stagei a granulation device and a solid phase polycondensation stagei which apparatus has a particularly simple and function-oriented design and construction and is characterised  in  that  the  granulation  device  has  a trickling tower-i that the trickling tower has in the head region a heated distribution trickling nozzle for the added precondensate-* that the trickling tower has*  after a predetermined free falling height for the droplet-shaped pellets leaving the distribution trickling nozzle-* at least one nitrogen extraction point-, that the trickling tower has a nitrogen feed in the floor region-, and that the nitrogen fed in at the floor region blasts the downwardly falling pellets  in  countercurrent-    In  this  connection  the trickling tower may ha\fe an tipper nitrogen extraction point and-t at a predetermined vertical distancei a lower nitrogen extraction point-  Further nitrogen extraction points are also conceivable within the scope of the invention.  The distribution trickling nozzle is designed in accordance oo^t-h the invention as a nozzle-shaped disc with a plurality of individual nozzles and/or nozzle outlet openings ana heating channels arranged on the inside-  In this way a particularly uniform distribution of the droplet-shaped pellets can be achieved over the cross-section of the trickling  tower.    The  nitrogen  extraction  points  are conveniently arranged in the tower wall-* and include for<br><br>
-6-<br>
example circulating sieve passages with suction channels covering the said sieve passages and suction pumps connected thereto- A common ethylene glycol separator and nitrogen drier is preferably associated with the suction pumps. The dried and heated nitrogen is recycled to the trickling tower in the floor region in order to generate the nitrogen countercurrenti while the recovered ethylene glycol is-i as already mentioned hereinbefore-&gt; returned to the esterification stage- The ethylene glycol separator communicates with the esterification stage- The invention furthermore envisages that the trickling tower has a for example circulating sieve passage arranged in the floor region and a feed channel covering the said sieve passage for the supply of dry and hot nitrogen- Furthermore the trickling tower may contain a pellet outlet in the floor region-i a gas-tight belt conveyor for removing the pellets and that can be charged with dry and hot nitrogen being arranged underneath the pellet outlet-, so that in practice a dry product conveyor is realised- The free falling height of the pellets is preferably 5 to 10 m and the vertical distance between the nitrogen extraction points is 10 to 3Q m-<br>
Instead of nitrogen other inert gases such as for example CO2 can also be used within the scope of the invention.<br>
