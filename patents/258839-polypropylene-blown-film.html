				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Polypropylene blown film<br>
The invention relates to a blown film comprising a polypropylene composition. In particular, the invention relates to polypropylene blown films having excellent optical properties, as well as mechanical properties.<br>
Technological background<br>
Polypropylene for films is today almost exclusively used for cast films. In the cast film process a very quick cooling of the melt is achieved with a chill roll, in order to utilise the potentially good optical and mechanical properties of polypropylene for film applications.<br>
Until now, polypropylene could be used in the blown film process only when it was possible to use water contact cooling in order to achieve the same quick cooling as in the cast film process.<br>
In a conventional blown film process using air cooling, the polypropylene melt and the films produced from it are only slowly cooled. This results in insufficient optical and mechanical parameters because the slow cooling process causes an uncontrolled growth of the crystal- and spherolitic structure. Polypropylene blown films produced with air cooling are both cloudy and brittle.<br>
It has been tried to improve the problem of cloudiness and brittleness of polypropylene blown films by using a combination of propylene random copolymer with either inorganic nucleating agent or sorbitol-based nucleating agents. Improvements of optical and mechanical parameters were only possible to a very limited extent.<br>
Object of Invention<br>
It is therefore the object of the invention to provide a polypropylene blown film having good optical parameters, comparable to those obtained with a cast film, together with a well balanced stiffness/drawability ratio.<br>
[Solution]<br>
The above object is achieved by a blown film comprising a polypropylene composition containing a propylene homopolymer or propylene copolymer with ethylene and/or another α-olefin, the polypropylene composition containing a clarifier comprising one or more phosphate-based α-nucleating agents and/or polymeric α-nucleating agents selected from the group consisting of vinylcycloalkane polymers and vinylalkane polymers.<br>
It was surprisingly possible to produce a polypropylene blown film having excellent optical parameters, good stiffness (tensile modulus) and drawability (elongation at break) on a conventional blown film plant using air cooling.<br>
This is particularly surprising, because for most other applications including blow molding, injection molding and also cast film, the sorbitol-based nucleating agents give the best or comparable gloss and haze .<br>
The propylene copolymer can be heterophasic or random, the latter being preferred. It contains ethylene and/or another α olefm, the a olefin can be a C4-C10, preferably a C4-C8 α olefin.<br>
The ethylene content of the copolymer can be up to 10 wt% or up to 8 wt%. A preferred content is less than 5 wt%, for example from 0,3 wt% to 4,8 wt%.<br>
Additionally the composition can contain other polymers like HOPE, LDPE, LLDPE, VLDPE, ULDPE or other polymers or copolymers containing ethylene and another a-olefln.<br>
The a-nucleating agents which may be used for the blown films of the invention include organic a-nucleating agents selected from the group of phosphoric acid ester metal salts represented by formula IFigure Removed) wherein R1 is oxygen, sulphur or a hydrocarbon group of 1 to 10 carbon atoms; each of R2 and R3 is hydrogen or a hydrocarbon group of 1 to 10 carbon atoms; R2 and R3 maybe the same or different from each other; two of R2, two of R3, or R2 and R3 may be bonded together to form a ring. M is a monovalent to trivalent metal atom; n is an integer from 1 to 3 and m is either 0 or 1, provided that n &gt; m.<br>
Preferred examples of the a-nucleating agents represented by the above formula include<br>
sodium-2,2'-methylene-bis(4,6-di-t-butylphenyl)phosphate1 sodium-2,21-ethylidene-bis(4,6-<br>
di-t-butylphenyl)phosphate, lithium-2,2'-methylene-bis(4,6-di-t-butylphenyl)phosphate,<br>

calcium-bis[2,2t-thiobis(4-methyl-6-t-butvlphenyl)phosphate], calcium-bis[2,2'-thiobis(4-<br>

butylphenyl)phosphate],	magnesium-bis[2,2'-ethylidene-bis(4,6-di-t-<br>
butylphenyl)phosphate], barium-bis[2,2
Of these, a!uminium-hydroxy-bis[2,2I-methylene-bis(4,6-di-t-butylphenyl)phosphate] is especially preferred.<br>
Further suitable a-nucleating agents are polymeric nucleating agents selected from the group consisting of vinylcycloalkane polymers and vinylalkane polymers. Nucleation with these polymeric nucleating agents is either accomplished by a special reactor technique,<br>
where the catalyst is prepolymerised with monomers like e.g. vinylcyclohexane (VCH). or by blending the propylene polymer with the vinyl(cyclo)alkane polymer. These methods are described in greater detail in e.g. EP 0 316 187 A2 and WO 99/24479.<br>
Among all a-nucleating agents mentioned above those which belong to the group of aromatic phosphoric acid ester metal salts are particularly preferred. It was found, that the intended effects, i.e. increased gloss, reduced haze and improved stiffness, are especially pronounced when this type of a-nucleating agent is used.<br>
From the group of aromatic phosphoric acid ester metal salts it is particularly preferred to<br>
use<br>
aluminium-hydroxy-bis[2,2'-methylene-bis(4,6-di-t-butylphenyl)phosphate].<br>
The polypropylene composition used for the blown films of the invention preferably contains from 0,001, preferably 0,01 to 5 wt% of the a-nucleating agent.<br>
Smaller amounts of a-nucleating agents than 0,001 wt% usually do not give the desired level of effect, while with larger amounts than 5 wt%, although giving the desired effect, the produced blown films are becoming too expensive because of the high priced nucleating agents.<br>
A further aspect of the invention relates to multilayer blown films, where at least one layer is comprised of a polypropylene blown film according to the invention.<br>
When polypropylenes are used, which are nucleated with sorbitol-based nucleating agents, it is not possible to coextrude such multilayer blown films without problems, because the volatility of sorbitol-based nucleating agents is already very high in the range of the necessary processing temperatures of the further layer(s). This causes rapidly growing deposits of nucleating agent around the extrusion die. The deposits have to be periodically removed for which it is necessary to stop the entire production.<br>
Therefore, the further aspect of the invention relates to multilayer blown films, where at least one layer is comprised of a polypropylene blown film containing a clarifier comprised of one or more phosphate based a-nucleating agents and at least one further layer is comprised of a polymer having a higher melting temperature than polypropylene.<br>
In addition to the benefits gained from the improved optical and mechanical properties of the polypropylene layer, such multilayer blown films can be produced by coextrusion without causing deposits around the extrusion die.<br>
The polymers having a higher melting temperature than polypropylene which are used for the coextrusion of multilayer blown films are preferably any one or more of polyamide, polyvinylalcohol and polyethylene terephthalate.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention a multilayer blown film comprises at least two layers, wherein at least one layer comprises a polypropylene composition according to the invention and at least one further layer is comprised of an ethylene polymer.<br>
In areas, where very low seal initiation temperature (SIT) in combination with good optics is required, it has been found, that combinations of polypropylenes with polyethylenes (e.g. C4-LLDPE or LDPE) are beneficial. Compared to PE, PP has high temperature resistance while PE has low SIT. For fast sealing process on packaging lines it is necessary to have as high sealing temperature as possible. Consequently, this requires a film with a top layer (the layer, which has direct contact to the sealing bars) having a high melt temperature in order to withstand the high sealing temperatures and a sealing layer with a very low melting temperature which starts sealing at lowest possible temperature and providing good seam strength. Such film properties can be achieved by a combination of transparent PP for the top layer and PE for the sealing layer.<br>
According to a further aspect the multilayer blown film comprises an adhesive layer intermediate to and adjacent to both the layer comprising a polypropylene composition according to the invention and the further layer comprising an ethylene polymer.<br>
In the case of conventional PE, an adhesive layer is required between those layers in order to give sufficient bonding strength between the PP and PE layer since PP and conventional PE have different polarities and therefore not sufficient adhesion.<br>
According to a still further embodiment the layer comprising a polypropylene composition according to the invention and the further layer comprising an ethylene polymer are adjacent to each other and the further layer is selected for having good adhesion to the layer comprising the polypropylene composition.<br>
The presence of an adhesive layer requires that such films can be produced by using at least a 3 layer coex film. It is therefore advantageous, when an intermediate adhesive layer can be omitted and the further layer itself is selected to provide sufficient bonding strength to the PP-layer.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment, the ethylene polymer of the further layer is a single site catalyst polyethylene (SSC-PE).<br>
By using a single site catalyst PE (SSC-PE) which is characterised by a low density (below 0,920 g/cm3) instead of the standard PE, a good adhesion to PP is obtained and no extra adhesive layer inbetween the PP- and PE-layer is necessary.<br>
The polypropylene compositions which are used for the films of the invention may contain various additives, which are generally used in polypropylene compositions, such as stabilisers, antioxidants, acid neutralising agents, lubricants, ultraviolet absorbers, antiblocking agents, antistatic agents, antifogging agents, etc.<br>
Preferred antioxidants are phenolic antioxidants, e.g. 2-t-butyl-4,6-dimethylphenol, 2,6-di-t-butyl-4-methyl-phenol, 2,6-di-t-butyl-4-isoamylphenol, 2,6-di-t-butyl-4-ethylphenol, 2-t-butyl-4,6-diisopro-pylphenol, 2,6-dicyclopentyl-4-methylphenol, 2,6-di-t-butyl-4-methoxymethylphenol, 2-t-butyl-4,6-dioctadecylphenol, 2,5-di-t-butylhydroquinone, 2,6-di-t-butyl-4,4-hexadecyloxyphenol, 2,2'-methylene-bis(6-t-butyl-4-methylphenol), 4,4'-thio-bis-(6-t-butyl-2-methylphenol), octade-cyl 3(3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl) propionate, 1 A5-trimethyl-2,4,6-tris(3',5'-di-t-bu-tyl-4-hydroxybenzyl)benzene and pentaerythrityl-tetrakis-3-(3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate.<br>
Preferred stabilisers are phosphite based stabilisers, e.g. tris-(2,4-di-tert.butylphenyl)-phosphite.<br>
The acid neutralising agents and/or lubricants are preferably carboxylic acid salts, where the metal is selected from the 1st or 2nd group of the periodic table or from transition metals like Zinc. Also synthetic hydrotalcite or Magnesium oxide can be used. Prefered carboxylates are Li-Stearate, Na-Stearate, K-Stearate, Li-Myristate, Na-Myristate, K-Myristate, Ca-Stearate, Mg-Stearate, Ca-12-hydroxy stearate, Mg-12-hydroxy stearate, Ca-Myristate, Ca-Palmitate, Ca-Laurate, Mg-Myristate, Mg-Palmitate, Mg-Laurate and Zn-Stearate.<br>

(Table Removed)Milfad 3988 ... 1,3 : 2,4 bis(3,4-dimethyl-benzylidene) sorbitol<br>
NA21 ... commercially available from Asahi Denka Kogyo (Japan) under the name "ADK<br>
STAB NA21E". NA21 contains aluminium-hydroxy-bis[2,2'-methylene-bis(4,6-di-t-<br>
butylphenyl)phosphate].<br>
Polymers 1 to 4 are equipped with conventional stabilisation, i.e. 0,15wt% Tris-(2,4-di-tert.butylphenyl)-phosphite, 0,1 wt% Pentaerythrityl-tetrakis-[3-(3,5-di-tert.butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionate] and processing aids, i.e. 0,05 wt% calcium stearate.<br>
Blown films were produced on a single screw extruder with a barrel diameter of 70 mm nd a round-section die of 200mm with 1mm die gap in combination with a monolip cooling ring and internal bubble cooling (IBC).
