				<td>A PROCESS FOR MAKING RARE EARTH DOPED OPTICAL FIBRE<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a Process for Making Rare Earth Doped Optical<br>
Fibre. Background Art<br>
Rare-earth (RE) doped optical fibres have shown great potential for a number of applications including amplifiers, fibre lasers and sensors. Oxides of rare earths are doped into the core of such fibres as the active substance. Lasing and amplification have been demonstrated at several wavelengths with the incorporation of various rare-earths but for telecommunication applications erbium doped fibre (EOF) remains the most important since the operating wavelength matches with the third low loss optical window.<br>
Erbium doped fibre amplifier (EDFA) operating around 1.53 um low loss window is playing the key role in the present day high capacity communication systems. It is able to amplify the optical signal directly independent of modulation format. Optoelectronic repeaters so long used in these systems were 3R devices with the limitations of amplifying the signal in discrete wavelengths. EDFA has the capability to amplify simultaneous optical channels in a single fibre, which has enabled the implementation of WDM (wavelength division multiplexing) technology with the potential of increasing the bandwidth of long distance transmission systems from Gb/s to Tb/s ranges. It thus exhibits high gain, large bandwidth, low noise, polarisation insensitive gain, substantially reduced cross talk problems and low insertion losses at the operating wavelengths. The success of future high capacity optical networking and transmission systems will depend significantly on the development of efficient EDFA.<br>
Reference may be made to Townsend J.E., Poole S.B., and Payne D.N., Electronics Letters. Vol. 23 (1987) p-329, ' Solution-doping technique for fabrication of rare-earth-doped optical fibre' wherein, the MCVD process is used to fabricate the preform with a step index profile and desired core-clad structure while solution doping is adopted for incorporation of the active ion. The steps involved in the process are as follows: i. A conventional cladding doped with PiOs and F is deposited within a high<br>
silica glass substrate tube to develop matched clad or depressed clad type<br>
structure.<br><br>
ii. The core layers of predetermined composition containing index-raising dopant like GeO.i are deposited at a lower temperature to form unsintered porous soot. iii. The tube with the deposit is immersed into an aqueous solution of the dopant precursor (ivpical concentration 0.1 M) up to 1 hour. Any soluble form of the dopant ion is suitable for preparation of the solution although rare earth halides have been mostly used.<br>
iv.        Following immersion, the tube is rinsed with acetone and remounted on lathe. v.         The core layer containing the RE is dehydrated and sintered to produce a clear glassy layer. Dehydration is carried out a temperature of 600°C by using chlorine. The level of OH" is reduced below Ippm using Ch / O? ratio of 5:2 provided the drying time exceeds 30 min.<br>
vi.       Collapsing in the usual manner to produce a solid glass rod called preform. vii.       Fibre drawing is conventional.<br>
Reference may also be made to DiGiovanni D.J., SPIE Vol. 1373 (1990) p-2 "Fabrication of rare-earth-doped optical fibre' wherein the substrate tube with the porous core layer is soaked in an aqueous or alcoholic solution containing a nitrate or chloride of the desired RE ion. The tube is drained, dried and remounted on lathe. The dehydration is carried out by flowing dry chlorine through the tube at about 900°C for an hour. After dehydration, the layer is sintered and the tube is collapsed to be drawn to fibre.<br>
Another reference may be made to Ainslie B.J., Craig S.P., Davey S.T., and Wakefield B.. Material Letters, Vol. 6, (1988) p-139, " The fabrication, assessment and optical properties of high- concentration Nd3+ and Er3+ doped silica based fibres"<br>
wherein optical fibres based on AbO3 - ?2O5. - SiOa host glass doped with high concentrations of Nd" * and Er f have been fabricated by solution method and quantified. Following the deposition of cladding layers ?2O5 doped silica soot is deposited at lower temperature. The prepared tubes are soaked in an alcoholic solution of 1 M Al(NO3)3 + various concentrations of ErCls and NdCls for 1 hour. The tubes are subsequently blown dry and collapsed to make preforms in the usual way. Al is said to be a key component in producing high RE concentrations in the core centre without clustering effect. It is further disclosed that Al and RE profile lock together in some way which retards the volatility of RE ion. The dip at the core centre is observed both for P and GeO2.<br><br>
Reference may also he made to US Patent No. 5,005,175 (1991) by Desuvire et al., 'Hrbium doped fibre amplifier" wherein the fibre for the optical amplifier comprises a single mode fibre eloped with erbium in the core having a distribution profile of the RE ion whose radius is less than i.9 urn while the radius of the mode of the pump signal exceeds 3 (im. The numerical aperture (NA) of the fibres varies from 0.2 to 0.35 and the core is doped with both Al and Ge oxides to increase the efficiency. As the radius of the Er doped core region is equal to or less than the radius of the pump mode of the fibre it o claimed that each atom of erbium in the core cross section is exposed to substantially equal levels of the high intensity portion of the pump mode. The fibre with such design is reported to have increased gain and lower threshold compared to the conventional Er doped fibre amplifiers where the radius of the Er doped core is large compared to the radius of the pump mode so that the erbium atoms at the edge of the core do not see a sufficient flux of the pump photons to yield a net gain.<br>
According to US Patent No. 5,491.581 (1996) by G.S. Roba. 'Rare earth doped optical fibre amplifiers' wherein high germania concentration in the core used to enhance the NA of the fibre is reported to result in generation of residual stress at the core-clad interface due to difference in viscosity and thermal expansion coefficient. Residual stress in turn is believed to produce undesirable increase in background loss of the fibre.<br>
According to US Patent No. 5,778,129 (1998) by Shukunami et.al., 'Doped optical fibre having core and clad structure are used for increasing the amplification band of an optical amplifier using the optical fibre' wherein the porous core layer is deposited after developing the cladding inside a quartz tube by MCVD process and solution doping method is employed to impregnate Er as the active ion into the porous core to be followed by vitrification and collapsing for making the preform. The solution also contains compound of Al, say chlorides, for codoping of the core with Al in order to expand the amplification band. The Er and Al doped glass constitutes first region of the core. Surrounding this are the second and third regions of the core. The third region contains Ge to increase the refractive index. The second region has an impurity concentration lower than both those of first and third regions and consequently low RI also. The second region acts as a barrier to prevent diffusion of the active dopant.<br><br>
Reference may also he made to US Patent No. 5474588 (1995) by Tanaka. D. et. al., "Solution doping of a silica with erbium, aluminium and phosphorus to form an optical fibre" wherein a manufacturing method for Er doped silica is described in which silica glass soot is deposited on a seed rod ( VAD apparatus ) to form a porous soot preform, dipping the said preform into an ethanol solution containing an erbium compound, an aluminium compound and a phosphoric ester, and desiccating said preform to form Kr, Al and P containing soot preform. The desiccation is carried out for a period of 24 -240 hours at a temperature of 60° - 70°C in an atmosphere of nitrogen gas or inert gas. This desiccated soot preform is heated and dehydrated for a period of 2.5 - 3,5 hours at a temperature of 950° - 1050°C in an atmosphere of helium gas containing 0.25 to 0.35% chlorine gas and further heated for a period of 3-5 hours at a temperature of 1400 ° - 1600°C to render it transparent, thereby forming an erbium doped glass preform. The segregation of AlCb in the preform formation process is suppressed due to the presence of phosphorus and as a result the doping concentration of Al ions can be set to a high level ( &gt;3 wt%). The dopant concentration and component ratio of Er, Al and P ions are claimed to be extremely accurate and homogeneous in the radial as well as in longitudinal directions. A few of the drawbacks of the above mentioned processes are as follows:<br>
1.	Step like RE distribution profile is obtained in the core resulting to poor overlap<br>
between the pump signal and the RE ions which lowers the pump efficiency.<br>
2.	Step like RE distribution requires high numerical aperture (NA) of the core or<br>
confinement of the RE in the central region (say 50% of the total core area) for<br>
increase in pump efficiency which in turn leads to the following disadvantages:<br>
i) Doping of RE only in selected portion of the core is extremely difficult and affects the repeatability of the process due to the sensitivity of the method to process parameters during various stages of processing such as deposition, solution doping, drying and sintering.<br>
ii) Increasing the NA of the fibre with simultaneously reducing the core area requires high germania concentration in a small core which enhances the possibility of formation of the dip , ,he centre due to evaporation during<br>
t<br>
sintering &amp; collapsing.<br>
iii) For preforms with high NA (&gt;0.20) high germania concentration in the core lowers the viscosity of the glass and makes the process very sensitive to<br><br>
temperature especially during the stages of porous soot layer deposition and<br>
sintering. iv)       Increase in temperature sensitivity during porous soot deposition leads to<br>
variation in composition and soot density along the length of the tube. v)        High germania concentration in the core results to generation of residual stress<br>
at the core-clad interface due to difference in viscosity and thermal expansion<br>
coefficient. Residual stress produces undesirable increase in background loss<br>
of the fibre vi)       Residual stress is believed to introduce  polarisation mode dispersion (PMD)<br>
which results in serious capacity impairments including pulse broadening.<br>
Since the magnitude of PMD at a given wavelength is not stable passive<br>
compensation becomes impossible.<br>
3.   Dehydration and sintering of the RE chloride containing soot layer is critical because it alters the composition by vaporisation and also diffusion of the dopant<br>
salt as well as GeOi present in the core.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for making Rare<br>
Earth doped optical fibre, which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide fibres possessing controlled<br>
distribution of RE. more particularly Erbium in the doped region similar to the pump<br>
beam intensity distribution in the fibre with maximum concentration at the centre so<br>
that the overlapping between the two is considerably improved.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide fibres in which the pump<br>
beam has a radius of distribution equal to or greater than the radius of distribution of<br>
RE ions in the core to increase the chances of all the active ions getting exposed to the<br>
pump light, consequently increasing the pump conversion efficiency in the fibre.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a method of controlling the<br>
Gaussian RE distribution profile along the radial direction in the core.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to achieve high optical gain in  the<br>
fibres for NA value close to 0.20 only thus avoiding wide variation in composition<br>
&gt;	i	
between the core and cladding glass to eliminate problems like residual stress and PMD.<br><br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to develop erbium doped fibres suitable for amplification of the input signal with NA and mode field diametc'- not widely different from signal transmitting fibre for ease of splice.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to reduce the possibility of change in composition of the paniculate core layer due to evaporation of the RE salt during drying and sintering .<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to reduce the quantity of germanium halide required to achieve the desired NA in the fibre.<br>
One more object of the present invention is to provide a process where the numerical aperture of the fibre is varied from 0.10 to 0.30 maintaining RE concentration in the core between 50 to 6000 ppm along with variation in RE distribution profile in the doped region to produce fibres suitable for application as amplifiers, fibre lasers and sensors for different purposes. Summary of the invention<br>
The novelty of the present invention lies in controlling the concentration profile of RE ion in the collapsed preform by minimising evaporation of the RE salt and also preventing diffusion of the rare earth ion due to subsequent heat treatment. The optimum soot density to achieve this objective is estimated to lie between 0.3 to 0.5 after deposition. The inventive step lies in transformation of the RE salts to oxides by gradually heating the tube to a higher temperature maintaining an oxidising atmosphere inside, thereby minimising the possibility of evaporation of RE during subsequent processing as the oxide has a very high melting temperature compared to halide/nitrate salts. This step also helps to remove the solvent trapped within the porous layer. The inventive step also includes increasing the temperature of the RE containing porous layer gradually in steps of 50 to 200°C up to the sintering temperature and above for sintering and further fixing of the RE ions in their desired sites. The steps will depend on the host glass composition and Er/Al concentration of the core layer. The incorporation efficiency of the RE from the solution to the core layer thus increases appreciably making the process more efficient and economic. The RE distribution along the transverse direction in the core will depend on the density of the porous soot layer, dipping period and the processing conditions during oxidation, sintering and collapsing.<br>
The sintering of the porous core layer in GeCh rich atmosphere along with the addition of oxygen and helium is another inventive step of the process which reduces<br><br>
The quantity of GeCI4 required to achieve the desired NA and adds to the economy of the<br>
process.   At temperatures between 200° to 1400°C during the sintering step pure GeCI4 is<br>
supplied with the input oxygen, the quantity of which depends on the NA desired in the fibre.<br>
The sintering is continued by gradually raising the temperature till a clear glassy layer is<br>
formed.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provided a process for making rare earth doped optical fibre,<br>
comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	depositing P205 and F doped synthetic cladding within a silica glass substrate tube to<br>
obtain matched or depressed clad type structure<br>
(b)	forming a core by depositing unsintered particulate layer comprising P205 and Ge02 concentrations from 0.5 to 5.0 mol% and 3.0 to 25.0 mol% at a tube surface temperature in the range of 1200° - 1400°C,<br>
(c)	containing F-doped cladding and porous soot layer, immersing the said tube as obtained in step (b) containing the porous soot laer into a solution containing rare earth salt in the concentration range of 0.002 M to 0.25M optionally in presence of aluminium salt in the concentration range 0.05 M to 1.25M for a period of 1 to 2 hours,<br>
(d)	draining the solution out at a rate in the range of 10 - 50 cc/min,<br>
(e)	drying the porous layer of the tube by flowing dry nitrogen or any other inert gas through the tube,<br>

2000° - 2300°C to obtain a perform, (j)   overcladding the perform with silica tube, and (k) obtaining fibres from the perform by conventional methods.<br>
(1) drawing fibres from the preform. The present invention further provides an process for making erbium doped optical fibre which comprises (a) providing deposition of P20s and F doped synthetic cladding within a silica glass substrate tube to obtain matched or depressed clad type structure, (b) forming a core by depositing unsintered particulate layer at a tube surface temperature in the range of 1200-1350°C, (c) maintaining PiOj and GeCh concentrations from 0.5 to 3.5 mol% and 3.0 to 20.0 mol% in the said particulate layer respectively to obtain a tube containing F-doped cladding and porous soot layer, (d) immersing the tube containing the porous soot layer into a solution containing Er salt in the concentration range of 0.004M to 0.20 M with or without aluminium salt at the concentration range of 0.05 M to 1.0 M for a period of 1 to 2 hours, (e) draining<br><br>
the solution out at a rate in the range of 10-30 cc/min, (f) drying the porous layer by (lowing dry nitrogen through or any other inert gas the tube, (g) heating the tube gradually in the presence of oxygen in the temperature range of 700-1000°C , (h) dehydrating the core layer of the tube at a temperature in the range of 800-1200 °C and in presence of excess Ch, (i) sintering the core layer in the presence of a mixture of oxygen and helium in the temperature range of 1400 to 1800°C, (j) collapsing the tube at a temperature in the range of 2000-2300°C to obtain a preform, (k) overcladding the preform with silica tube, and (1) drawing fibres from the preform.<br>
The present invention also provides an process for making rare earth doped optical fibre wherein the RE distribution along the transverse direction in the core is varied by controlling the density of the porous soot layer, dipping period and the processing conditions during oxidation, sintering and collapsing depending on the host glass composition and RE/Al concentration of the core layer. The numerical aperture of the fibre is varied from 0.10 to 0.30 maintaining RE concentration in the core between 50 to 6000 ppm along with variation in RE distribution profile along the radial direction in the doped region to produce fibres suitable for application as amplifiers, fibre lasers and sensors for different purposes.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, theoretically estimated relative density of<br>
the porous soot ranges between 0.30 to 0.50 to avoid core-clad interface defect.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention GeCU supplied during soot deposition<br>
is 10 to 30% less than that required for achieving the desired NA numerical aperture.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the pump beam has a radius of distribution<br>
equal to or greater than the radius of distribution of Er ions in the core, which<br>
enhances the chance of all the active ions getting exposed to the pump light.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, relatively high gain is achieved in the fibres<br>

salts is prepared using solvent selected from alcohol and water.<br><br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the temperature of the core layer<br>
is increased in steps of 50 to 200"C during oxidation and sintering depending on the<br>
composition and Al/RE concentration of the core layer.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the mixture of Oi and He is in the<br>
range of 3:1 to 9:1.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention source of chlorine is selected<br>
from CCU where Helium is used as carrier gas.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the proportion of Clj: Ch varies<br>
from 1.5: 1 to 3.5: 1 while the dehydration period lies between 1 to 2 hours.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the porous core is sintered in<br>
presence of germania by supplying GeCU with the input oxygen at a temperature of<br>
1200°C to 1400°C during sintering to facilitate germania incorporation and obtain<br>
appropriate numerical aperture.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the process provides variation in the numerical aperture<br>
of the fibre from 0.10 to 0.30 maintaining RE concentration in the core between 50 to<br>
6000 ppm along with variation in RE distribution profile along the transverse<br>
direction in the doped region to produce fibres suitable for application in any devices.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the devices are amplifiers, fibre lasers and sensors for<br>
different purposes where optical fibre is used.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention is a method of controlling the Gaussian RE<br>
distribution   profile   along   the   radial direction in a core used in the process of<br>
making rare earth doped optical fibre wherein, said process comprising the steps of:<br>
a)	Depositing ?2Os and F within a high silica glass substrate tube to make<br>
matched clad or depressed clad type structure.<br>
b)	Depositing predefined composition of unsintered paniculate layer at a<br>
temperature of 1200 to 1400°C for the forming a core, wherein P2Os and<br>
GeO2 levels in the core vary from 0.5 to 5.0 mol% and 3.0 to 25.0 mol%<br>
respectively, and GeCl4 concentration in the gas phase is kept 10 to 30%<br>
lower than that required for achieving the desired NA of 0.20.<br>
c)	The deposition temperature is dependent on the composition and desired<br>
porosity of the soot. A theoretically estimated porosity of 0.3 to 0.5 is found<br>
suitable to avoid core-clad interface defect and clustering after dipping and to<br>
control the RE distribution in the core with maximum concentration at the<br>
centre.<br>
d) Immersing the tube containing the porous soot layer into an alcoholic aqueous solution of RECb / RE(NO3)i of strength varying between 0.002 M and 0.25 M with or without the addition of AlCb / A1(N(&gt;,)! in the concentration range 0.05 M to 1.25 M for a period of one to two hours.<br>
ei Draining out the solution slowly at a rate of 10 to 50 cc/min. to avoid imperfection in the porous soot material, particularly at the lower end of the tube.<br>
f)	Passing dry nitrogen through the tube for sufficient drying of the porous<br>
layer and the tube is remounted on lathe.<br>
g)	Repeatedly heating the RE/A1 containing particulate layer in the range from<br>
600 to 1 100°C (tube surface temperature), in presence of Ch+He wherein the<br>
temperature is increased in steps of 50 to 200°C thus oxidising the RE/A1<br>
chloride or nitrate present in the layer to corresponding oxides, wherein the<br>
ratio of OT&amp; He is varied between 3:1 to 9:1.<br>
h) The particulate core layer containing RE is dehydrated at a temperature between 800° to 1200°C in presence of excess chlorine. CCU is used as the source material for Ch and supplied by using Helium as a carrier gas which being a lighter gas diffuses through the small pores and assists in the drying process. The proportion of C^: Ch varies from 1.5: 1 to 3.5: 1 while the dehydration period lies between 1 to 2 hours.<br>
i) The porous core layer is then sintered in presence of O2 and He by heating the tube to a temperature as high as 1900°C. The temperature is gradually increased in steps of 50 to 200°C depending on the composition and RE/A1 concentration of the core layer from the drying temperature between 800 to 1200°C mentioned above.<br>
j) At temperatures between 1200° to 1400°C during sintering pure GeCU is supplied with the input oxygen to carry out the sintering of the porous layer in germania rich atmosphere which facilitates germania incorporation. The flow rate of GeCU and the no. of pass depend on the NA desired in the fibre.

The main advantages of the present invention are:<br>
1. The developed fibres have a RE distribution in the doped region similar to the 
2. The pump beam has a radius of distribution equal to or greater than the radius of distribution of RE ions in the core, which enhances the chance of dl the active ions getting exposed to the pump light.<br>
T\ The RE distribution along the transverse direction in the core is varied by controlling the density of the porous soot layer, dipping period and the processing conditions during oxidation, sintering and collapsing depending on the host glass composition and RE/'Al concentration of the core layer.<br>
4.	The compositions of the core and cladding glass are varied to achieve NA close to<br>
0.20 for Er" ion concentration in the range of 100 to 1500 ppm in order to provide<br>
erbium doped fibre suitable for pumping for amplification of the input signal with<br>
gain in the range 10 to 37 dB for optical amplifier application.<br>
5.	Wide variation in composition between the core and cladding glass is avoided due<br>
to relatively low NA in the RE doped fibres mentioned under 4 above eliminating<br>
problems like residual stress and PMD which may substantially degrade the<br>
performance of the fibres.<br>
6.	The developed fibres mentioned under 4 and 5 above have NA and mode field<br>
diameter not widely different from signal transmitting fibre for ease of splice. This<br>
minimises the optical loss of the signal travelling through the fibres.<br>
7.	Sintering in germania rich atmosphere facilitates incorporation of germania m the<br>
core and reduces the quantity of germanium halide necessary during deposition to<br>
achieve the desired NA making the process efficient and economic.<br>
8.	The oxidation step before drying and sintering of the particulate layer reduces the<br>
possibility of change in composition due to evaporation of RE salts during<br>
subsequent processing.<br>
9.	The stepwise increase in temperature during oxidation and sintering stages<br>
prevents diffusion of RE and the codopants minimising the probability of a change<br>
in composition.<br>
10.	The incorporation efficiency of RE in the doped region is increased due to the<br>
reason stated in 8 and 9 above, which adds to the economy of the process.<br>
11.	The improvement in process efficiency due to the reasons mentioned in 8 - 10<br>
above enhances the yield and repeatability of the process.<br>
12.	The concentration of RE in the core is varied between 50 to 6000 ppm along with<br>
variation in RE distribution profile in the doped region and NA between 0.10 to<br>
0.30 to produce fibres suitable for application as amplifiers, microlasers and<br>
sensors for different purposes.<br><br>
