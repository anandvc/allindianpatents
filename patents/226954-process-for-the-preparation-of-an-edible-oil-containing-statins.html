EDIBLE OIL CONTAINING STATINS<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br>
WO 2005/104864<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/003246<br><br>
1 Edible oil containing statins<br>
Description 5<br>
Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to an edible oil comprising statin comprising at least 90% of di- and/or triglycerides 10 having a saturated fatty acid (SAFA) content of less than 25 wt%. Furthermore the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of such an oil. In addition, the present invention relates to the use of such an oil.<br>
15 Background of the invention<br>
Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly in the United States and in Western European countries and is emerging in developing countries. Several factors are mentioned in relation to the<br>
20 development of cardiovascular disease including hereditary predisposition to the disease, gender, lifestyle factors such as smoking and diet, age, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, including hypercholesteremia. Several of these factors, particularly hyperlipidemia and hypercholesteremia, contribute<br>
25 to the development of atherosclerosis, a primary cause of vascular and heart disease.<br>
Elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (hereafter "LDL-cholesterol") is directly related to an increased risk of <br>
30 coronary heart disease.<br><br>
WO 2005/104864<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/003246<br><br>
2<br>
Statins are compounds that are known to have a lowering effect on levels of LDL-cholesterol in the human blood. Statins inhibit the hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the rate-determining step in the cholesterol 5 biosynthesis.<br>
Scientific research has confirmed the healthy properties of statins especially with respect to LDL blood-cholesterol and triglyceride levels lowering activities, both in animals and in 10 humans (Li et al.,   Nutrition Research 18, 71-81 (1998); Heber et al.,   Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 69, 231-236 (1999)).<br>
The presence of statins in food consumed by humans is associated with a lower level of LDL-cholesterol and lower risk 15 of coronary heart disease.<br>
For the preparation of food containing statins, it is advantageous to have a statin source that has a high statin content and is widely applicable in food products.<br>
20<br>
WO02/64809 describes a process for the preparation of statins by fermentation and food products comprising one or more statins. It describes the extraction of statins from fermented soya beans with organic solvents (ethanol and acetonitril) and<br>
25 the use of the extract for the preparation of magarine and<br>
spreads. The drawback of this process is that the yield of the statins is rather low (0.0545 g statin/kg (ethanol extract) and 0.0978 g statin /kg (acetonitril extract)). Furthermore, when these extracts are used to prepare food products the extraction<br>
30 fluid has to be removed, which involves an extra processing step. In addition, even after vigorous evaporation and drying there may be some organic extraction fluid residue left in the extract, which is undesirable when the extract is going to be<br><br>
WO 2005/104864<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/003246<br><br>
3<br>
used in food products. Moreover, when considering environmental issues the use of organic solvents should be kept to a minimum.<br>
Summary of invention<br>
5 An object of the invention is to provide an edible oil<br>
containing statins. In addition, an object of the invention is to provide an oil with a high unsaturated fatty acid content and a low saturated fatty acid content. Another object of the invention is to use the edible oil containing statins for the <br>
10 preparation a food product. A further object of the invention is to provide a simple process containing as few steps as possible for the preparation of an edible oil containing statins.<br>
15 We have now surprisingly found that extracting an oil-containing substrate which is fermented with a statins producing micro-organism with a supercritical fluid provides an edible oil containing statins.<br>
20 Detailed description of the invention<br>
The preparation of purified statins is known from the pharmaceutical industry. The preparation and purification of the statins used in pharmaceutical preparations involves many<br>
25 process-steps, in which ingredients are used that are not<br>
commonly used in the food industry. The many process steps are costly compared to processes having less process steps. For these reasons the statins prepared for pharmaceutical use are not used in the foods industry. Synthetic or half-synthetic<br>
30 statins, e.g. as used in the pharmaceutical industry, are also less desirable in food products.<br><br>
WO 2005/104864<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/003246<br><br>

In WO02/063976, a functional food product comprising soy protein and statin is described, that reduces the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level in human beings. The food products may be prepared by fermenting soy with one or more 5 filamentous fungi. These products contain both soy protein and statin, thereby limiting statin containing products to products also containing soy protein. In addition the amount of statin in the products is such that a large amount of these products has to be used to obtain a LDL-cholesterol lowering effect. For 10 a more general application in the food industry, it is<br>
advantageous to have a product that has a large concentration of statin and contains as few other compounds as possible.<br>
The following definitions will be used:<br>
15<br>
Statins are defined as substances having the structural formula, presented in figure 1. In this structural formula, Rl and R2 can be any group. Preferred statins are those which are given in figure 1.<br>
20<br>
The amounts given will be expressed, in wt.% or weight parts per million (ppm), mg/kg or mg/g, relative to the total weight of the food product, unless otherwise indicated.<br>
25 The amounts of statins given herein are the sura of the amounts of individual statins, as e.g. determined by chromatography, unless otherwise indicated.<br>
An object of the invention relates to a process for the <br>
30 preparation of an edible oil containing statin. Statin containing oil may be obtained by extraction with super critical fluid of a substrate which is fermented with a statin producing fungus.<br><br>
WO 2005/104864<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/003246<br><br>
5<br>
A supercritical fluid is formed when a gas is compressed at a temperature too high to form a liquid. Above a certain temperature, called the critical temperature, the thermal kinetic energy of the gas molecules is always higher than the <br>
5 	attraction energy between the molecules. Above this<br>
temperature, no pressure is high enough to condense the vapour into a liquid. A certain minimum pressure, called the critical pressure, is necessary to form a supercritical fluid. Below this critical pressure, the component is behaving as a gas. For <br>
10  a pure component, there is no difference any more between gas and liquid at conditions above its critical temperature and pressure. This is reflected in a combination of a low, gas-like viscosity and a high, liquid-like density.<br>
15 Many gases may be used in super critical fluid extractions, like the noble gases, other gases like nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen, alkenes like ethane and propene, alkanes like methane, ethane, propane, and butane, alkynes and alkylhalides like tetrafluoro methane. Very suitable gases are those approved by<br>
20 the FDA as safe human food ingredients, like carbondioxide, nitrogen, helium, propane, n-butane, iso-butane, and nitrous oxide (N2O). For application in food processing, carbon dioxide is especially suitable for use in supercritical extraction. Carbon dioxide has a relatively low supercritical temperature<br>
25 and pressure and it is cheap, non-toxic and easily removed.<br>
Optionally, inorganic and/or organic compounds may be added to the supercritical fluid. These modifiers or co-solvents employed in the process should be compatible with the <br>
30 supercritical fluid selected and also be capable of at least partially dissolving the compounds being extracted. Ethanol, acetone, water, diluted acids or bases and ethanol/water (50/50 v/v) mixtures are suitable co-solvents.<br><br>
WO 2005/104864<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/003246<br><br>
6<br>
In a preferred embodiment no co-solvent is used in the extraction process. Preferably, the supercritical fluid is free of co-solvents. The supercritical fluid is food grade and its purity is preferably 99% or more. <br>
5<br>
The substrate may be contacted with the super critical fluid at temperatures ranging from 20 to 95°C, preferably 30 to 60°C. The pressure should be sufficient to maintain the supercritical <br>
10 	fluid, and may be increased from 75 to about 550 bar, preferably between 150 and 400 bar.<br>
The choice of the reaction parameters will vary depending on the super critical fluid and modifier used. The skilled person <br>
15 	will be able to determine which conditions to use based upon the known properties of the substrate, the compound to be extracted as well as the gas specifications, including supercritical temperature and pressure.<br>
20 The substrate may vary depending on whether it may be fermented with a statin producing fungus.<br>
It has been shown that statins can be produced by a variety of filamentous fungi, including Monascus,  Aspergillus, <br>
25 Penicillium,   Pleurotus,   Pythium,  Hypomyces,   Paelicilomyces, EupeniciIlium,   and Doratomyces.<br>
As a food product, rice fermented with a red Monascus  fungus (red rice) has been known and used for hundreds of years in <br>
30 China. Red rice was used and still is used in wine making, as a food-colouring agent and as drug in traditional Chinese medicine. We have found that most red rice available on the market contains no statins or statins in very low amounts. The<br><br>
WO 2005/104864<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/003246<br><br>
7<br>
Food and Drug Administration has concluded that red yeast rice available in the market does not contain significant amounts of lovastatin (FDA, Docket No. 97-0441, Final Decision).<br>
5 WO 99/23996 describes a composition for treating elevated serum cholesterol and/or triglycerides comprising a red rice product containing at least 0.05% lovastatin by weight.<br>
	Red rice powder capsules are sold as dietary supplements under <br>
10 the name of Cholestin by the firm Pharmanex. Pharmanex also sells a Cholestin bar containing red yeast rice (Monascus purperus  went) .<br>
Red rice has an intensive red colour. Whereas the intensive red<br>
15 colour of red rice is an advantage when it is used as colouring agent, it is a disadvantage when it is used in food products. Due to the intense red colour of red-rice products, the foods prepared from red rice are coloured, depending on the amount of red-rice product added to the food product yellow, orange or<br>
20 red. The higher the amount of red rice added to the food, the more intense is the red colour of the food product. In the known food products a relatively large amount of red rice has to be added in order to add enough statins. This results in a red colour of the products that cannot be avoided.<br>
25<br>
In some food products the red rice colouring is undesirable. In particular in the western world, consumers are reluctant to use products of which the colour has changed from that they are used to. For example spreads, including margarine, butter,  low<br>
30 fat spreads or salad oils are considered unacceptable by<br>
customers, when the colour of such a product is orange or red. However, at the same time these type of products have been found by us to be excellent vehicles of the daily intake of<br><br>
WO 2005/104864<br><br>
PCT7EP2005/003246<br><br>
8<br>
amounts of statins sufficient to obtain a blood LDL-cholesterol lowering effect.<br>
Preferably the fungus is chosen from the group consisting of Monascus  fungi and more preferably from the group consisting of<br>
5 Monascus ruber  fungi.<br>
Most preferably the fungus is Monascus ruber  F125 Ml-4, which gives no red coloring when grown on soy material.<br>
The fermentation may be carried out in a manner, which can be <br>
10 determined by the skilled person on the basis of the methods described in WO02/064809 and WO02/063976.<br>
The fermentation temperature may be important. The temperature is preferably in the range of 10 to 37°C, more preferably 20 to <br>
15 30°C.<br>
Preferably during fermentation the medium is aerated, e.g. by stirring, shaking etc. Aeration may be carried out by blowing air through the fermentation medium. Preferably the air is <br>
20 wholly or partly saturated with water vapour in case solid state fermentation is used. This avoids drying out of the fermentation medium.<br>
The levels of statins will depend on the fermentation time. The <br>
25 fermentation time is therefore dependent on the desired amount of statins. Preferred fermentation time is 1-50 days, more preferably 15-40 days, most preferably 20-30 days (See WO02/064809 and WO02/063976).<br>
30 In addition, the substrates preferably contain oil that can be extracted together with the statin produced by the fungus. Suitable substrates that may be used are soybeans, nuts like hazelnuts, wallnuts, and peanuts, olives, sunflower seeds,<br><br>
WO 2005/104864<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/003246<br><br>
9<br>
rapeseeds, rice, kidneybeans, mungbeans, lupine seeds, maize, or oat.<br>
The substrate preferably contains oil with a high poly-<br>
5 unsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content and a low saturated fatty acid (SAFA) content.<br>
Especially suitable substrate are soybeans. Soybean oil has little flavor, which is an advantage because it does not<br>
10 interfere with the taste of the food. Soybean oil is the most commonly used oil in food manufacturing. Soybean oil is adaptable to nearly every fat or oil application in the food industry. It works well with other ingredients, including other fats and oils, making it very suitable for use in fat-based<br>
15 foods e.g. spreads, salad dressings, sauces and baked goods.<br>
The process of the present invention provides for an edible oil containing statin. An edible oil is defined as an oil or fat which is suitable for human consumption. The expression oil as<br>
20 used in the present application includes both solid fat and<br>
liquid oil. The edible oil comprises of more than 90 wt% of di-and/or triglycerides. The oil is ready to use for the preparation of food products and in the case with liquid oils as table oil. The oil according to the invention may be any<br>
25 edible oil depending on the substrate used, e.g. soybean oil, olive oil, sunflower oil, or rapeseed oil.<br>
Preferably the edible oil comprises at least 1 mg/g statin, and more preferably at least 4 mg/g statin. 30<br>
In addition to the oil and statins other compounds that are beneficial for hearth health, such as for instance polyphenols, polyunsaturated fatty acids, phytosterols,  peptides,<br><br>
WO 2005/104864<br><br>
PCT7EP2005/003246<br><br>
10<br>
tocopherols, saponins, dietary fibers and vitamins may be extracted together with the oil and statins from the fermented substrate.<br>
5	Polyphenols herein are polyphenols having plant origin. These include flavenoids, which include isoflavones. The polyphenols include isoflavones, stilbenes, lignans, coumestans and resorcyclic acid lactones. Examples of isoflavones are genistein, daidzein, equol, glycitein, <br>
10 biochanin A,   coumestrol, maitaresinol, formononetin, 0-<br>
desmethylengolesin, enterolactone and enterodiol. Preferred isoflavones according to the invention are genistein and daidzein and glycitein, which are present in soybeans.<br>
15 Saponins are herein derived as b-D-glucopyranosiduronic acid derivates. Examples of saponins are Soya sapogenol A,B,C,D and E, Soyasaponin I, II and III, as described in Lebensmittel Lexikon, B.Behr's Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. Hamburg, Bd.2, L-Z -3, 1993, pages 550-552.<br>
20<br>
Polyunsaturated fatty acid esters are defined as fatty acid esters having more than one unsaturated group in the fatty acid chain. Examples of polyunsaturated fatty acid esters are linoleic acid esters, linolenic acid esters, arachidonic acid<br>
25 esters.<br>
Dietary fibers are herein a collective term for a variety of plant substances, that are resistant to digestion by the human gastrointestinal enzymes. Depending on their solubility, <br>
30 dietary fibers can be classified into insoluble (cellulose, some hemicelluloses, lignins), and soluble (remainder of the hemicelluloses, gums, mucilages. Soybean colyledon fibers comprise both soluble and insoluble dietary fibers.<br><br>
WO 2005/104864<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/003246<br><br>
11<br>
Phytosterols are herein defined as sterol compounds produced by<br>
plants, which are structually very similar to cholesterol<br>
except that they contain some substitutions at the C24 position<br>
on the sterol side chain. The phytosterols include 4-<br>
5 desmethylsterols, 4-monomethylsterols, 4,4'-dimethylsterols and<br>
mixtures thereof. Examples of such phytosterols are p-<br>
sitosterol, campesterol, stigmasterol. The term phytosterols<br>
herein also includes phytostanols, the saturated equivalents of<br>
phytosterols.<br>
10<br>
Tocopherols are members of the vitamin E family. The term<br>
vitamin E includes eight naturally occurring isomers with<br>
widely varying degrees of biological activity. Four are in the<br>
form of tocopherols (a, b, g, d); The remaining four are in the<br>
15 form of tocotrienols (a , b , g, d).<br>
The role of Vitamin E is unique and indispensable. Its structure allows it to position itself strategically and protect the cell and other membranes. It also protects LDL and <br>
20 other lipids from oxidation.<br>
Gamma-tocopherol, is the effective form that fights nitrogen free radicals. These radicals are major culprits in arthritis, multiple sclerosis (MS) and diseases of the brain (such as<br>
25 Alzheimer's). A metabolic product of gamma-tocopherol appears to help regulate the amount of fluid and electrolytes that pass through the kidney and end up in urine. Thus, it could play a major role in blood pressure control, congestive heart failure, and cirrhosis of the liver.<br>
30<br>
The National Academy of Science's Recommended Daily Intake (RDI) for vitamin E is 15 milligrams. International units are used as a measure of alpha tocopherol. The IU is based on alpha-tocopherol acetate. 1 mg alpha-tocopherol acetate<br><br>
WO 2005/104864<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/003246<br><br>
12<br>
corresponds to 1.0 IU alpha-tocopherol acetate, and 1 mg alpha-tocopherol = 1.49 IU alpha tocopherol.<br>
Furthermore alpha-tocopherol equivalent (alpha-TE) is also used <br>
5 	for a measure of vitamin E. The alpha-tocopherol equivalent takes into account all 8 members of the vitamin E family in foods.<br>
alpha-tocopherol equivalent = (mg alpha) + (0.4 mg beta) + 10 (0.01 mg gamma) + (0.1 mg delta).<br>
The recommended daily intake (RDI) of tocopherol is 10 a-tocopherol equivalents/day<br>
15 In another embodiment the present invention relates to an edible oil comprising statin comprising at least 90% of di-and/or triglycerides and 50 to 1000 alpha tocopherol equivalents per kg, preferably 100 to 750 alpha tocopherol equivalents, even more preferably 250 to 750 alpha tocopherol.<br>
20<br>
A suitable amount of total tocopherol is 500 to 10000 mg/kg. total tocopherol is the sum of all the tocopherol present. Preferred amounts are 750 to 5000 mg/kg, more preferred 1000 to 2500 mg/kg.<br>
25<br>
Suitably the edible oil of the present invention has a saturated fatty acid (SAFA) content of less than 25 wt%, preferably less than 20 wt%, more preferably less than 15 wt%. Furthermore the edible oil according to the present invention<br>
30 has an unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) content of at least 75 wt%, at least 80 wt% and even more preferably, at least 85 wt%. It is desirable for the edible oil of the present invention to have a polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content of more than 5<br><br>
WO 2005/104864<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/003246<br><br>
13<br>
wt%, preferably more than 15 wt %, more preferably more than 30 wt% and most preferably more than 50 wt%.<br>
It is preferred that the edible oil of the present invention <br>
5	has less than 10 mg/kg of cholesterol.<br>
Another object of the invention is to use the edible oil for the preparation a food product. Several food products may be prepared according to the invention, for example, spreads,<br>
10 		magarines, soups, pasta, noodles, ice-cream, sauces, dressing, mayonnaise, snacks, cereals, beverages, bread, biscuits, other bakery products, sweets, bars, chocolate, chewing gum, dairy products, dietetic products e.g. slimming products or meal replacers etc. In particular pasta, soya-milk or cow-milk may<br>
15 	be prepared according to the invention.<br>
The food product according to the invention preferably comprises statins in an amount sufficient to obtain a blood LDL-cholesterol lowering effect if the food product is used <br>
20 	according to the common needs of the consumer.<br>
The preferred intake of statin per day is herein 5-40    mg/day, more preferably 5-20 mg/day, even more preferably 8-15 mg/day. Furthermore, the intake of statin per day is preferably 1-5 <br>
25 mg/day, more preferably 1-2.5 mg/day.<br>
	The skilled person will be able to adjust the percentage of statins in the food product to obtain the above effect. The percentages will depend on the type of food product, since the <br>
30 	food products are used in different serving sizes. Moreover the pattern in a food product is consumed (servings per day and distribution over days) is dependent on the food product.<br><br>

Preferably the food product according to the invention comprises statin and non-glycosylated isoflavone. In soy beans and soy materials derived from soy, isoflavones are present <br>
5	substantially in the glycosylated form. Typically about 5 wt.% of the isoflavones is present in the non-glycosylated form. The most important glycosylated isoflavones are genistin, daidzin and glycetin. The non-glycosylated forms are respectively genistein, daidzein and glycetein. Genistein, daidzein and <br>
10 glycetein have been reported to have advantageous health effects, including estrogenic and antioxidant properties.<br>
We have found that due to the fermentation according to the invention the glycosylated isoflavones are converted into the<br>
15 corresponding non-glycosylated isoflavones, which are more<br>
benificial. For instance, the amount of genistein and daidzein is increased in the fermented soy compared to the non-fermented soy. Surprisingly this advantageous conversion occurs simultaneously with the production of statin.<br>

When colours are classified, they can be broken down into the three primary elements. One is the Hue (colour) the other is Value (brightness) and the third is Chroma (Saturation like vivid colours or dull colours).<br>
25<br>
To enable anyone to tell anyone else exactly what colour they are talking about a common numerical code is used. This numerical code used is L*a*b*. When a colour is expressed in this system, Value becomes L*, while Hue and Chroma are<br>
30 expressed as a* and b* respectively. The L*a*b* may be measured with a UV 1601 spectofotometer of Shimatzu.'<br><br>

16 Examples<br>
General:<br>
	Supercritical extraction <br>
5 	For the supercritical extraction of natural solid matrices, equipment of Thar Designs was used. The experimental set-up is schematically depicted in Fig. 2.<br>
	The CO2  pump is capable of compressing liquid carbon dioxide to <br>
10 a pressure up to 600 bars at a constant flow-rate. In a static mixer, a polarity modifier may be mixed with the liquid carbon dioxide. The maximum pressure that can be applied in the presence of a modifier is about 400 bar. In a pre-heater (not depicted) the carbon dioxide (+modifier) was heated to reach<br>
15 supercritical conditions before entering the extraction vessel.<br>
In the extraction vessel, which was heated with a double wall heating mantle, the supercritical carbon dioxide was passed over the solid matrix for extraction.<br>
20<br>
Downstream of the extraction vessel, the supercritical carbon dioxide was expanded over an automated backpressure regulator. The backpressure regulator was coupled to a feedback control unit to control the pressure in the system. The carbon dioxide<br>
25 was separated from the extracted material (liquid/solid) in a cyclone separation system. The carbon dioxide left the cyclone at the top, while the extracted material remained in the cyclone. The liquids extracted from the solid matrix were recovered during the experiment by opening the valve at the<br>
30 bottom of the cyclone.<br><br>

The carbon dioxide gas was further expanded over a further backpressure regulator, which was operated manually. A gas clock downstream of the backpressure regulator registers how much gas has been put through the system, before the carbon <br>
5 	dioxide leaves the system at ambient pressure.<br>
The process equipment is designed to operate at the following conditions:<br>

Determination of lovastatins using HPLC<br>
Samples were prepared by adding 25 ml of an extraction mixture, 15 containing acetonitrile, water and phosphoric acid (1:1:0.05, v/v/v) to approximately 5 g of soybeans. Statin in oil samples (40-100% oil) and liquid samples (like soymilk) were extracted by the addition of 100% acetonitrile  in a 1:1 ratio (v/v).<br><br>

	Samples were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature and then homogenised using an Ulta-Turrax. After homogenisation the samples were incubated overnight at room temperature on a roller bench. The samples were centrifuged at 11.000 rpm for 10 <br>
5 	minutes and the supernatants collected for HPLC analysis. The amount of lovastatin in the samples was determined by HPLC separation according to the method of Morovjan et al. J. chromatogr. A 763 (1997) 165-172. The system consists of the Shimadzu SCL-10A system controller,<br>
10   CTO-10AS column oven, LC-10AT vp pump system, RID-10A<br>
refraction index detector, SPD-M10A diode array detector and SIL-10AD autoinjector. For the chromatographic determination of lovastatin a Waters NovaPak C18 (150x3.9 mm I.D., 4um) column was used operating at 25°C. The eluent was acetonitril-0.1%<br>
15 phosphoric acid (50:50,v/v) solution flowing at 1.5 ml/min. Runs were performed for 15 min. The detection was performed using a diode array detector from 190 nm up to 800 nm. The sum of the area of all peaks in the spectrum belonging to lovastatin is measured. Comparison to a standard (Mevinolin,<br>
20 Sigma) allows the calculation of a lovastatin content (expressed in mg/g analysed product).<br>

Fermentation, process<br>
Substrates like soybeans, kidney bean, mung bean, lupine seeds, walnut, maize, oat and peanuts were soaked in tap water (50°C) for 60 minutes. After soaking the substrates were rinsed with<br>
15 cold tap water. Subsequently the substrates were air-dried at ambient temperature for 180 minutes. The soaked and dried substrates were transferred to a shake-flask, approximately 50 g per flask. The shake flasks were sterilised by autoclaving (10 min 120 °C), inoculated with 1 ml of a fully-grown Monascus<br>
20 culture and incubated for an appropriate time (2-6 weeks) at 25°C. Lovastatin production is monitored and when a sufficient level has been obtained, the flasks are pasteurised by placing the flasks in an incubator at 80°C overnight after which the end product can be harvested.

5 The fermented soybeans were ground prior to extraction in water-cooled universal mill (type M20, IKA, Germany) until a fine powder was obtained.<br>
The amount of sample used for extraction was 100 gram of ground <br>
10 fermented soybeans. The fermented and ground soybeans were put in the extraction vessel (500 ml) and the remaining volume was filled with small glass beads (2 mm diameter). The total solvent flow rate was 20 g-min"1. In the case of addition of modifier, 18 g-min-1 carbon dioxide was mixed with 2 g-min-1 <br>
15  modifier (ethanol or ethanol/water mixture). The flow rates<br>
were adjusted using the control software supplied with the<br>
Thar extraction equipment. At time intervals of 30 minutes,<br>
the cyclone separation vessel was opened and the extracted oil<br>
was collected. The total extraction time was 2 hours. The<br>
process <br>
20 is suitable for industry-scale extraction.<br>

Comparative example A, B, C: Soxhlet extraction with different solvents<br>
For use in food applications, the extraction of statins from fermented soybeans can be performed with a number of organic <br>
5 	solvents: hexane, acetone, ethyl acetate and ethanol or mixtures of these.<br>
For testing the extraction with different organic solvents classical Soxhlet extraction was performed.  Approximately 135<br>
10 g of ground fermented soybeans was put in an extraction<br>
thimble. Approximately 500 ml of organic solvent was added and the extraction was performed for 3 hours. After the extraction the organic solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure with a rotatory evaporator until constant weigh. An aliquot was<br>
15 taken for the determination of the statin concentration using reversed phase chromatography (HPLC, Shimadzu). Results are. shown in Table 5.<br><br>
