Moreover, the herbicidal compositions and synergistic herbicidal mixtures according to the invention can also be used in crops which tolerate the action of herbicides due to breeding, including genetic engineering methods.<br>
The mixtures according to the invention, or the herbicidal compositions comprising them, can be employed, for example, in the form of directly sprayable aqueous solutions, powders, suspensions, also highly-concentrated aqueous, oily or other suspensions or dispersions, emulsions, oil dispersions, pastes, dusts, materials for spreading or granules, by means of spraying, atomizing, dusting, spreading or pouring.<br>
The use forms depend on the intended purposes; in any case, they should guarantee the finest possible distribution of the active ingredients according to the invention.<br>
Suitable inert auxiliaries are mineral oil fractions of medium to high boiling point such as kerosene and diesel oil, furthermore 1 coal tar oils and oils of vegetable or animal origin, aliphatic, cyclic and aromatic hydrocarbons, e.g. paraffins, tetrahydronaphthalene, alkylated naphthalenes and their derivatives, alkylated benzenes and their derivatives, alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol and cyclohexanol, ketones such as cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents, such as N-methylpyrrolidone and water.<br>
Aqueous use forms can be prepared from emulsion concentrates, suspensions, pastes, wettable powders or water-dispersible granules by adding water. To prepare emulsions, pastes or oil dispersions, the substrates [sic], as such or dissolved in an oil or solvent, can be homogenized in water by means of wetting agent, tackifier, dispersant or emulsifier. However, it is also possible to prepare concentrates composed of active substance, wetting agent, tackifier, dispersant or emulsifier and, if appropriate, solvent or oil, and these concentrates are suitable for dilution with water.<br>
Suitable surfactants are the alkali metal, alkaline earth metal and ammonium salts of aromatic sulfonic acids, e.g. ligno-, phenol-, naphthalene- and dibutylnaphthalenesulfonic acid, and of fatty acids, of alkyl- and alkylaryl sulfonates, of alkyl sulfates, lauryl ether sulfates and fatty alcohol sulfates, and salts of sulfated hexa-, hepta- and octadecanols, and of fatty alcohol glycol ether, condensates of sulfonated naphthalene and its derivatives with formaldehyde, condensates of naphthalene, or of the naphthalenesulfonic acids, with phenol and formaldehyde.<br><br>
polyoxyethylene octylphenyl ether, ethoxylated isooctyl-, octyl-or nonylphenol, alkylphenyl and tributylphenyl polyglycol ether, alkylaryl polyether alcohols, isotridecyl alcohol, fatty alcohol/ethylene oxide condensates, ethoxylated castor oil, polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers or polyoxypropylene alkyl ethers, lauryl alcohol polyglycol ether acetate, sorbitol esters, lignin-sulfite waste liquors or methylcellulose.<br>
Powders, materials for spreading and dusts can be prepared by mixing or concomitantly grinding the synergistic herbicidal mixture or the individual active ingredients with a solid carrier.<br>
Granules, e.g. coated granules, impregnated granules and homogeneous granules, can be prepared by binding the active ingredients to solid carriers. Solid carriers are mineral earths such as silicas, silica gels, silicates, talc, kaolin, limestone, lime, chalk, bole, loess, clay, dolomite, diatomaceous earth, calcium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, magnesium oxide, ground synthetic material, fertilizers such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium phosphate, ammonium nitrate, ureas and products of vegetable origin such as cereal meal, tree bark meal, wood meal and nutshell meal, cellulose powders or other solid carriers.<br>
The concentrations of the mixtures according to the invention in the ready-to-use products can be varied within wide ranges. In general, the formulations comprise from 0.01 to 95% by weight, preferably 0.5 to 90% by weight, of the mixture according to the invention.<br>
The active ingredients of components A) and B) can be formulated jointly, but also separately, and/or applied to the plants, their environment and/or seeds jointly or separately. It is preferable to apply the active ingredients simultaneously. However, it is also possible to apply them separately.<br>
Moreover, it may be advantageous to apply the herbicidal compositions and synergistic herbicidal mixtures according to t?he invention, jointly or separately, with additional other crop protection agents, for example with pesticides or agents for controlling phytopathogenic fungi or bacteria. Also of interest is the miscibility with mineral salt solutions which are employed for treating nutritional and trace element deficiencies. Non-phytotoxic oils and oil concentrates can also be added.<br><br>
The mixtures according to the invention and the herbicidal compositions can be applied pre- or post-emergence, if the active ingredients are less well tolerated by certain crop plants, application techniques may be used in which the herbicidal compositions are sprayed, with the aid of the spray apparatus, in such a way that they come into as little contact, if any, with the leaves of the sensitive crop plants while reaching the leaves of undesirable plants which grow underneath, or the bare soil (post-directed, lay-by).<br>
In the case of a post-emergence treatment of the plants, the herbicidal compositions according to the invention are preferably applied by foliar application. Application may be effected, for example, by usual spraying techniques with water as the carrier, using amounts of spray mixture of approx. 100 to 1000 1/ha.

Use examples<br>
5 The mixtures according to the invention were applied pre- or post-emergence (foliar treatment). The herbicidal compounds of component B were applied in the formulation in which they are present as commercially available product.<br>
^0 Some of the experiments were greenhouse experiments and st^me were field trials on mini plots (on a site with sandy loam (pH 6.2 to 7-0) or sandy clay (pH 5.0 to 6.7) as the soil).<br>
The harmful plants differed with regard to size and developmental 15 state; on average, they were 5 to 20 cm long, depending oi^ the growth habit.<br>
The herbicidally active compounds of components A) and B) were applied in succession or jointly, in the latter case in scÂ«ne 20 cases as a tank mix and in some cases as a readymix, in ttie form of emulsions, aqueous solutions or suspensions, the vehicle being water (300 - 400 1/ha). In the case of the field trials, application was effected with the aid of a mobile plot spfayer.<br>
The test period extended over 3 to 8 weeks, and the standi were also observed at later points in tine.<br>
ferriage by the herbicidal compositions was evaluated with reference to a scale of 0% to 100% in comparison with untreated control plots. 0 means no damage and 100 means complete destruction of the plants.<br>
The following examples will demonstrate the action of the herbicidal compositions which can be used according to thÂ£ invention, without excluding the possibility of other useÂ£.<br>
l4i these examples, the value E at which	only an additive effect<br>
of the individual -active ingredients is	to be expected wa2<br>
calculated by the method of S. R. Colby	(Calculating synergistic<br>
and antagonistic responses of herbicide	combinations, Weeds 15,<br>
20 pp (1967).<br><br>
This was done using the formula<br>
E = X + v - â<br>
5	100<br>
where<br>
X = Percentage of the herbicidal action of component A) at an I     application rate of a;<br>
Y = Percentage of the herbicidal action of component B) at an application rate of b;<br>
E = expected herbicidal action of component A) + B) at rates of application a + b {in %).<br>
If the value observed exceeds the value E calculated in accordance with Colby's formula, then synergism is present.<br>
The herbicidal mixtures according to the invention exert a greater herbicidal action than would have been expected according to Colby on the basis of the observed effects of the individual components when used alone.<br><br><br><br>
