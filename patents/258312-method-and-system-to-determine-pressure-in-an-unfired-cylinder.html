METHOD AND APPARATUS TO DETERMINE PRESSURE IN AN UNFIRED CYLINDER<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] This invention pertains generally to control systems for engine and<br>
powertrain systems.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Internal combustion engines are employed on various devices,<br>
including mobile platforms, to generate torque for traction and other<br>
applications. An internal combustion engine can be an clement of a<br>
powertrain architecture operative to transmit torque through a transmission<br>
device to a vehicle driveline. The powertrain architecture can further include<br>
one or more electrical machines working in concert with the engine. During<br>
ongoing operation of the mobile platform employing the internal combustion<br>
engine, it may be advantageous to discontinue firing one or more of the<br>
cylinders, including stopping engine operation and engine rotation completely.<br>
It may be further advantageous to subsequently have knowledge of pressure<br>
within the cylinder, to effectively spin, fire, and restart the engine during<br>
ongoing operation, to control and manage engine torque vibration, reduce<br>
noise, and improve overall operational control of the powertrain.<br>
[0003] Prior art systems use models developed off-line to determine cylinder<br>
pressure. Such systems are advantageous in that they minimize need for real-<br>
time computations. However, such systems have relatively poor accuracy, due<br>
to variations introduced by real-time variations in factors including<br>
atmospheric pressure, engine speed, initial engine crank angle, engine wear<br>
characteristics, and others. Therefore, there is a need to accurately determine<br>
engine cylinder pressure in real-time during ongoing operation of the engine.<br><br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0004] In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, an article of<br>
manufacture and method are provided, comprising a storage medium having<br>
machine-executable code stored therein. The stored code is to determine<br>
pressure in an unfired cylinder of an internal combustion engine. The cylinder<br>
comprises a variable volume combustion chamber defined by a piston<br>
reciprocating within a cylinder between top-dead center and bottom-dead<br>
center points and an intake valve and an exhaust valve controlled during<br>
repetitive, sequential exhaust, intake, compression and expansion strokes of<br>
said piston. The code is executed to determine volume of the combustion<br>
chamber, and determine positions of the intake and exhaust valves. A<br>
parametric value for cylinder pressure is determined at each valve transition.<br>
Cylinder pressure is estimated based upon the combustion chamber volume.<br>
positions of the intake and exhaust valves, and the cylinder pressure at the<br>
most recently occurring valve transition.<br>
[0005] These and other aspects of the invention will become apparent to<br>
those skilled in the art upon reading and understanding the following detailed<br>
description of the embodiments.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0006] The invention may take physical form in certain parts and<br>
arrangement of parts, an embodiment of which is described in detail and<br>
illustrated in the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and<br>
wherein:<br>
[0007] Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram of an exemplary engine, in accordance<br>
with the present invention; and,<br>
[0008] Fig. 2 is a schematic diagram of an exemplary control scheme, in<br>
accordance with the present invention.<br><br>
GP-309392-PTH-CD<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF AN EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0009] Referring now to the drawings, wherein the depictions arc for the<br>
purpose of illustrating the invention only and not for the purpose of limiting<br>
the same, Fig. 1 depicts a schematic of an internal combustion engine 10 and<br>
control system 5 which has been constructed in accordance with an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The engine is meant to be illustrative,<br>
and comprises a conventional fuel-injection spark ignition engine. It is<br>
understood that the present invention is applicable to a multiplicity of internal<br>
combustion engine configurations.<br>
[0010] The exemplary engine comprises an engine block 25 having a<br>
plurality of cylinders and a cylinder head 27 is sealably attached thereto.<br>
There is a moveable piston 11 in each of the cylinders, which defines a<br>
variable volume combustion chamber 20 with walls of the cylinder, the head,<br>
and the piston. A rotatable crankshaft 35 is connected by a connecting rod to<br>
each piston 11, which reciprocates in the cylinder during ongoing operation.<br>
The cylinder head 27 provides a structure for intake port 17. exhaust port 19.<br>
intake valve(s) 21, exhaust valve(s) 23, and spark plug 14. A fuel injector 12<br>
is preferably located in or near the intake port, is fluidly connected to a<br>
pressurized fuel supply system to receive fuel, and is operative to inject or<br>
spray pressurized fuel near the intake port for ingestion into the combustion<br>
chamber periodically during ongoing operation of the engine. Actuation of the<br>
fuel injector 12, and other actuators described herein, is controlled by an<br>
electronic engine control module ('ECM'). which is an element of the control<br>
system 5. Spark plug 14 comprises a known device operative to ignite a<br>
fuel/air mixture formed in the combustion chamber 20. An ignition module,<br>
controlled by the ECM, controls ignition by discharging requisite amount ol~<br>
electrical energy across a spark plug gap at appropriate times relative to<br>
combustion cycles. The intake port 17 channels air and fuel to the combustion<br>
chamber 20. Flow into the combustion chamber 20 is controlled by one or<br>
more intake valves 21, operatively controlled by a valve actuation device<br><br>
GP-309392-PTH-CD<br>
4<br>
comprising a lifter in conjunction with a camshaft (not shown). Combusted<br>
(burned) gases flow from the combustion chamber 20 via the exhaust port 19.<br>
with the flow of combusted gases through the exhaust port controlled by one<br>
or more exhaust valves 23 operatively controlled by a valve actuation device<br>
such as a second camshaft (not depicted). Specific details of a control scheme<br>
to control opening and closing of the valves are not detailed. Valve actuation<br>
and control devices, including hydraulic valve lifter devices, variable cam<br>
phasers, variable or multi-step valve lift devices, and cylinder deactivation<br>
devices and systems can be utilized to extend operating regions of the engine<br>
and fall within the purview of the invention. Other generally known aspects of<br>
engine and combustion control are known and not detailed herein. The engine<br>
operation typically comprises conventional four stroke engine operation<br>
wherein each piston reciprocates within the cylinder between top-dead center<br>
(TDC) and bottom-dead center (BDC) locations defined by rotation of the<br>
crankshaft 35. with opening and closing of the intake valves and exhaust<br>
valves controlled during repetitive, sequential exhaust, intake, compression<br>
and expansion strokes.<br>
[0011] In one embodiment, the engine is an element of a hybrid powertrain<br>
system comprising the engine, an electro-mechanical transmission, and a pair<br>
of electric machines comprising motor/generators. The aforementioned<br>
elements are controllable to selectively transmit torque therebetween, to<br>
generate tractive or motive torque for transmission to a drivcline and to<br>
generate electrical energy for transmission to one of the electrical machines or<br>
to an electrical storage device.<br>
[0012] The ECM is preferably an element of the overall control system 5<br>
comprising a distributed control module architecture operative to provide<br>
coordinated powertrain system control. The powertrain system control is<br>
effective to control the engine to meet operator torque demands, including<br>
power for propulsion and operation of various accessories. Communication<br>
between the control system and the engine 10 is depicted generally as element<br><br>
GP-309392-PTH-CD<br>
5<br>
45, and comprises a plurality of data signals and control signals that arc<br>
transferred between elements of the engine and the control system. The ECM<br>
collects and synthesizes inputs from sensing devices, including a MAP<br>
(manifold absolute pressure) sensor 16, an engine crank sensor 31, an exhaust<br>
gas sensor 40, and a mass airflow sensor (not shown), and executes control<br>
schemes to operate various actuators, e.g., the fuel injector 12 and the ignition<br>
module for spark ignition at the spark plug 14, to achieve control targets,<br>
including such parameters as fuel economy, emissions, performance,<br>
driveability, and protection of hardware. The ECM is preferably a general-<br>
purpose digital computer generally comprising a microprocessor or central<br>
processing unit, storage media comprising read only memory (ROM), random<br>
access memory (RAM), electrically programmable read-only-memory<br>
(EPROM), a high speed clock, analog-to-digital (A/D) and digital-to-analog<br>
(D/A) conversion circuitry, and input/output circuitry and devices (I/O) and<br>
appropriate signal conditioning and buffer circuitry. Control schemes,<br>
comprising algorithms and calibrations, are stored as machine-executable code<br>
in memory devices and selectively executed. Algorithms arc typically<br>
executed during preset loop cycles such that each algorithm is executed at<br>
least once each loop cycle. Algorithms stored as machine-executable code in<br>
the memory devices are executed by the central processing unit and are<br>
operable to monitor inputs from the sensing devices and execute control and<br>
diagnostic routines to control operation of the respective device, using preset<br>
calibrations. Loop cycles are typically executed at regular intervals, for<br>
example each 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 100 milliseconds during ongoing<br>
engine and vehicle operation. Alternatively, algorithms may be executed in<br>
response to occurrence of an event.<br>
[0013] The invention comprises a simulation model that is stored as<br>
machine-executable code and is regularly executed in the control system. The<br>
simulation model is operative to calculate, in real-time, a cylinder pressure for<br>
each cylinder as a function of engine crank angle. Cylinder pressure is<br><br>
GP-309392-PTH-CD<br>
6<br>
generated by the action of crankshaft rotation wherein movements of the<br>
pistons in the engine cylinders are resisted by air trapped within the<br>
combustion chambers of the cylinders. Crank torque, i.e., torque exerted on<br>
the crankshaft by each piston, is determined from the cylinder pressure. Total<br>
engine crank torque is determined, comprising a sum of the cylinder torques<br>
calculated for each cylinder. Each cylinder torque is determined by<br>
multiplying a torque ratio by a cylinder pressure. The torque ratio is<br>
determined for each cylinder as a function of crank angle, which encompasses<br>
changes in cylinder geometry and cylinder friction. The torque ratio is<br>
preferably a pre-calibrated array of values stored in memory, and retrievable<br>
as based upon crank angle.<br>
[0014] The simulation model generally comprises machine-executable code,<br>
stored in the ECM or other control module of the control system, which<br>
determines pressure in an unfired cylinder(s) of the internal combustion engine<br>
during operation of the powertrain system when the engine is motoring, i.e.,<br>
the engine crankshaft is rotating without spark ignition and fuel injection to<br>
the cylinders. . The simulation model begins execution substantially<br>
simultaneously with start of rotation of the stopped engine, or when engine<br>
firing has stopped due to stoppage of engine fueling and/or spark ignition.<br>
Such instances of operation occur when the engine is being started, or stopped,<br>
or when specific cylinders are deactivated. Engine starting can comprise<br>
rotation of the engine crankshaft for a period of time before introducing fuel or<br>
spark ignition to cylinders. The pressure is preferably determined regularly<br>
every few degrees of engine rotation, typically at least once every five degrees<br>
of crankshaft rotation, or during each 6.25 ms loop cycle.<br>
[0015] The code comprises determining an instantaneous measure of<br>
combustion chamber volume, and determining positions of the intake and<br>
exhaust valves. This includes determining cylinder pressure at each valve<br>
transition. There are four valve transition events which occur during ongoing<br>
engine operation, comprising intake valve opening (IVO). intake valve closing<br><br>
GP-309392-PTH-CD<br>
7<br>
(IVC), exhaust valve opening (EVO) and exhaust valve closing (EVC).<br>
Cylinder pressure for each unfired cylinder is determined based, upon the<br>
combustion chamber volume, positions of the corresponding intake and<br>
exhaust valves, and the cylinder pressure at a most recently occurring valve<br>
transition.<br>
[0016] The cylinder pressure is calculated, as described hercinbelow. The<br>
general cylinder pressure equation is as follows in Eq. 1:<br>
P2 = P1 * (V1 /V2)1.3	[1]<br>
[0017] wherein P2 indicates cylinder pressure at the current timestep, and P1<br>
indicates cylinder pressure determined at the most recently occurring valve<br>
transition. Cylinder compression is approximated as an adiabatic<br>
compression, i.e., having minimal or no heat transfer. The term V1 comprises<br>
combustion chamber volume at the most recently previously occurring valve<br>
transition, and V2 comprises the combustion chamber volume at the current<br>
timestep, based upon a predetermined calibration comprising a range of<br>
combustion chamber volumes determined based upon engine crank angle. An<br>
algorithm operative to execute Eq. 1 is executed only when the intake and<br>
exhaust valves are all closed, i.e., ValveState is ValvesClosed. Pressure and<br>
torque calculations are preferably computed at the highest calculation rate, i.e.,<br>
6.25 ms.<br>
[0018] When the exhaust valves are open (i.e., ValveState is ExhaustOpen),<br>
P2 is determined based upon a first-order lag filter leading to atmospheric<br>
pressure. An overall assumption is that the airflow speeds are sufficiently low<br>
that exhaust backpressure is at ambient atmospheric pressure. When the<br>
intake valves arc open, P2 is determined based upon a first-order lag filter<br>
leading to manifold pressure. An overall assumption of the model is that the<br>
airflow speeds are sufficiently low enough that exhaust backpressure is fixed<br>
at zero (0.0 kPa) for all calculations. When the valves are closed, necessary<br>
data is calculated before the valves close. Eor forward engine rotation, the<br>
intake valve is closing, P1 is initialized to manifold pressure (MAP) and V1 is<br><br>
GP-309392-PTH-CD<br>
8<br>
calculated by using the angle for IVC and the calibration of combustion<br>
chamber volume based upon engine crank angle. For reverse engine rotation.<br>
the exhaust valve is closing. P1 is initialized to atmospheric pressure and V1 is<br>
calculated by using the angle for EVO and the calibration of combustion<br>
chamber volume based upon engine crank angle. A correction is also made<br>
for leakage and blow-by past the piston, which is critical for low engine<br>
speeds to achieve correct initial conditions, this comprises modifying the<br>
value for P1 to P1adj to account for losses proportional to the pressure<br>
difference between P1 and P2, this modification or adjustment comprising Hq.<br><br>
wherein K is a calibratable system-specific filter coefficient or gain<br>
factor.<br>
[0019] The calibration of combustion chamber volumes (V1. V2) based<br>
upon engine crank angle is preferably stored in RAM as a long indexed array<br>
of the combustion chamber volume corresponding to engine crank angle to<br>
enhance computational speed, allowing the control module executing the<br>
simulation to determine the torque ratio from a precalibrated array index based<br>
upon engine crank angle. The exponent function for (V1/ V2)1.3 is estimated<br>
as a second-order polynomial for the ranges of representative volume ratios<br>
(V1/V2 ranging from about 0.2 to 15), which provides a good practical fit and<br>
dramatically reduces computational load. Key strategies to effect real-time<br>
pressure and torque calculations include the previously described calibration<br>
for combustion chamber volume based upon engine crank angle, and a<br>
calibration for crank torque based upon cylinder pressure, which are<br>
determined offline for the specific engine application and executed as<br>
calibrations to minimize computational load.<br>
[0020] Each opening and closing event of the intake and exhaust valves is<br>
modeled as discrete, i.e., the valve is either open or closed. When one of the<br>
valves is transitianed to open, the cylinder pressure is filtered to one of cither<br><br>
GP-309392-PTH-CD<br>
9<br>
manifold pressure (MAP) or exhaust pressure. PEXHAUST- which is assumed to be<br>
atmospheric pressure, as shown in Eq. 3:<br><br>
wherein P2 indicates cylinder pressure at the current timestep, and P1<br>
indicates cylinder pressure determined at the most recently occurring valve<br>
transition. Each valve timing event requires accurate timing, preferably less<br>
than five crank angle degrees of rotation. This includes speed-based<br>
corrections which are made to account for airflow dynamics and pump-down<br>
and leakage of valve lifters.<br>
[0021] The effect of valve position and valve timing on cylinder pressure is<br>
also modeled for inclusion in the control scheme. During ongoing engine<br>
operation the four valve transition events, comprising intake valve opening<br>
(IVO), intake valve closing (IVC), exhaust valve opening (EVO) and exhaust<br>
valve closing (EVC), ongoingly occur. With regard to modeling cylinder<br>
pressure, crank angle at which IVC occurs is critical, as this initiates engine<br>
operation with all the valves closed when the engine is rotating in a positive<br>
direction, and the combustion chamber is essentially a closed chamber with<br>
pressure varying based upon volume of the combustion chamber. To limit<br>
computational load, only factors significantly affecting IVC angle arc<br>
modeled. Within the fastest computational loop (i.e., 3.125 ms) the simulation<br>
model monitors crank angle for each cylinder and assigns a ValveStatc flag<br>
which is set to one of IVO, EVO. and, Valves Closed (IVC and EVC). Valve<br>
overlap is ignored because of the minor influence on crank torque. There are<br>
two primary influences on IVC angle. Air flow dynamics arc a function of<br>
engine speed and change the effective valve closing angle when modeling the<br>
valve timing as 100% open or 100% closed.<br><br>
GP-309392-PTH-CD<br>
10<br>
[0022] Furthermore, at low and zero engine speed, hydraulic valve lifters<br>
tend to leak down on any valves that are in an open state, until either the valve<br>
closes or the lifter fully collapses. As engine speed increases the velocity of<br>
air exiting the valve increases. Therefore, the valve must open further for<br>
similar pressure drop. This is addressed using computational flow dynamics<br>
(CFD) simulations developed off-line executed with actual valve dynamics to<br>
assess the maximum cylinder pressure achieved at piston top-dead-center<br>
(TDC). The simplified model shown in Eq. 2 can be restated as Eq. 4:<br><br>
wherein VIVc is combustion chamber volume at intake valve closing;<br>
PTDC is cylinder pressure at top-dead-center;<br>
PIVC is cylinder pressure at intake valve closing; and,<br>
VTDC is combustion chamber volume at top-dead-center.<br>
VIVC can be used to directly determine the crank angle at IVC, which<br>
depicts valve lift at the equivalent IVC (EIVC) using a prccalibrated cam<br>
profile calibration, IntakeProfile, to determine valve lift based upon crank<br>
angle. An off-line simulation is preferably used to determine the calibration<br>
table for valve lift based upon engine speed (IVCLift v RPM) at different<br>
engine speeds. The data is curve-fit to determine a slope of lift at IVC, based<br>
upon the engine speed. This calibration permits real-time determination of the<br>
valve lift at which to transition the model from the intake valve being open<br>
(IVO) to the intake valve being closed (IVC) by multiplying the calibration<br>
value by the engine speed, as shown in Eq. 5:<br>
EIVC Lift = RPM * IVCLift v RPM.	[5] <br>
[0023] Valve lifters can leakdown at slow engine speed and engine off,<br>
which affects the effective valve timing at engine start. When a valve is open,<br>
the valvetrain load is applied to the hydraulic lifter, which is not a perfectly<br>
sealed device, resulting is fluid leaks and lifter and valve displacement. The<br>
leakdown rate is highly variable with temperature, wear, and component<br>
tolerances. The lifter leaks until it either bottoms out or the valve closes. The<br><br>
GP-309392-PTH-CD<br>
11<br>
cylinder model typically does not track during the few seconds it takes the<br>
lifter to leak down at zero speed, due to too many sources of variation.<br>
However, control schemes typically transition cylinders to unfired operation<br>
for longer than a few seconds, allowing the final position to be modeled<br>
reasonably well.<br>
[0024] In this embodiment, only the intake valve lifter is modeled to reduce<br>
computational load and save time. The effect of exhaust valve timing on<br>
compression torque is considered less critical. This is because opening of the<br>
exhaust valve occurs at the end of the pressure estimation operation, and<br>
closing of the exhaust valve is coincident with opening of the intake valve, and<br>
outside of the pressure estimation window described with reference to Eq. 2,<br>
above.<br>
[0025] Based upon ValveState data, when the valve transition state<br>
comprises IVO, or IntakeOpen, the lifter leakdown variable for that cylinder is<br>
incremented. Data is typically provided in dimensions of millimeters (mm) of<br>
lift and referenced to the cam profile. The leakdown variable is limited to a<br>
calibrated value for maximum leakdown. When the ValveState changes to<br>
ValvesClosed or ExhaustOpen then the lifter leakdown is reset to zero. For<br>
the exhaust valve transitions, angles for EVO and EVC are fixed calibrations,<br>
because variation in timing of either transition does not introduce enough final<br>
torque error to warrant the calculations to model more completely. For the<br>
intake valve transition, both IVO and IVC are adjusted. The IVO transition is<br>
preferably calculated using a base calibration for IVO (BaseIVO) based upon<br>
the cam profile diagram incremented by a factor based upon an approximate<br>
slope of the cam opening (CamSlope) and the lifter leakdown<br>
(LifterLeakdown):<br>
IVO angle = BaselVO + CamSlope*LifterLeakdown<br><br>
GP-309392-PTH-CD<br>
12<br>
[0026] The angle for IVC is calculated more accurately using both<br>
LifterLeakdown and the lift required for effective IVC. The actual cam profile<br>
is preferably used as a calibration to provide the intake valve profile,<br>
IntakeProfile, based upon cam lift and camshaft angle. The total cam lift<br>
where the intake valve is considered open is computed as:<br>
Lift = EIVC_Lift + LifterLeakdown.<br>
[0027] The angle for IVC can be looked up in the cam profile calibration,<br>
IntakeProfile, at the calculated lift. This calculation typically occurs at one of<br>
the slower loop cycle rates, with the data fed into the fast inner loop to<br>
estimate cylinder pressures and assign valve state for each of the intake and<br>
exhaust valves.<br>
[0028] The calibration of torque ratio based upon crank angle,<br>
TorqRatio Vs Angle, is preferably constructed offline and represents an<br>
equivalent value for crank torque (in Nm) as a function of cylinder pressure<br>
(in kPa) determined at each crank angle. The torque ratio parameters arc<br>
developed for the specific engine design and configuration, and include factors<br>
related to cylinder geometry and piston friction. A factor for torque ratio,<br>
TorqRatio, can be determined from the calibration TorqRatio Vs Angle for<br>
each cylinder as a function of crank angle. Thus, cylinder torque for a given<br>
cylinder comprises the estimated cylinder pressure multiplied by the torque<br>
ratio, i.e., CylTorq = TorqRatio * CylPres. Total crankshaft torque is<br>
determined to be a sum of the cylinder torque values. CylTorq, for each of the<br>
cylinders. The calibration of TorqRatioVs Angle is preferably stored in non-<br>
volatile computer memory as an array to improve computational speed.<br>
[0029] The real-time simulation model for determining cylinder compression<br>
pressure preferably begins operating at or before the point in time at which the<br>
engine crankshaft begins spinning, or after engine firing has been discontinued<br>
precedent to stopping engine rotation. Thus by modeling valve timing,<br>
generating calibration tables offline, and assuming simple adiabatic<br><br>

compression, the instantaneous torque applied to the crank can be accurately<br>
estimated in real time in the control module.<br>
[0030] Referring now to Fig. 2, a schematic block diagram of an overall<br>
control scheme designed in accordance with an embodiment of the invention<br>
is provided. The control scheme described is preferably executed using an<br>
embedded controller in the control system described herein. The control<br>
system preferably executes the control scheme when there is a need for<br>
information related to cylinder pressure including engine crank torque, for<br>
purposes of engine or powertrain control, such as during starting of the engine,<br>
or during engine shutdown. The control scheme may also be executed when<br>
one or more of the cylinders are deactivated.<br>
[0031] There are two functional elements of the overall control scheme,<br>
comprising a control scheme operative to calculate cylinder torque and<br>
pressure, depicted as CalCylTorqPress, and a control scheme operative to<br>
calculate cylinder data, depicted as CalcCylData.<br>
[0032] The CalcCylData control scheme is preferably executed each 25 ms<br>
loop cycle for each engine cylinder when enabled, such as during an engine-<br>
start operation. Inputs to the CalcCylData control scheme comprise the<br>
number of engine cylinders (NumCyls), crankcase pressure (CrankCasePress).<br>
engine intake manifold pressure (MAP), engine speed (EngkPM), exhaust<br>
system pressure (ExhaustSysPress). Further inputs include the lifter state<br>
(LifterState) and current cylinder pressure (CylPres) for the selected engine<br>
cylinder, which are outputs from the CalCylTorqPress control scheme.<br>
Another input comprises the precalibrated array of combustion chamber<br>
volume determined as a function of engine crank angle (DispVsAngle). From<br>
the inputs previously described, various outputs of the CalcCylData control<br>
scheme are determined and input to CalCylTorqPress control scheme. The<br>
outputs comprise intake valve opening angle (Phi_IntVlvOpen). intake valve<br>
closing angle (Phi_IntVlvCls), an initial combustion chamber volume<br>
(InitialCylVol), and an initial cylinder pressure (InitialCylPrs) for the cylinder.<br><br>
GP-309392-PTH-CD<br>
14<br>
[0033] The CalCylTorqPress control scheme is preferably executed during<br>
each 6.25 ras loop cycle for each engine cylinder when enabled. Inputs to the<br>
CalCylTorqPress control scheme comprise states of parameters typically based<br>
upon measurements, including engine crank angle (CrankAngle), and engine<br>
intake manifold pressure (MAP). Other engine states that are determined<br>
comprise crank case pressure (CrankCasePress) and exhaust system pressure<br>
(ExhaustSysPress). Further values include exhaust valve opening angle<br>
(Phi ExhVlvOpen) comprising a predetermined calibration for torque ratio<br>
determined based upon crank angle (TorqRatioVsAngle), a predetermined<br>
calibration for combustion chamber displacement based upon crank angle<br>
(DispVsAngle), and the number of cylinders (NumCyls). Furthermore, the<br>
inputs from CalcCylData control scheme, including intake valve opening<br>
angle (Phi IntVlvOpen), intake valve closing angle (Phi IntVlvCls), an initial<br>
combustion chamber volume (InitialCylVol), and an initial cylinder pressure<br>
(InitialCylPrs) are provided.<br>
[0034] The CalCylTorqPress control scheme is configured to manipulate the<br>
inputs described to calculate and determine the outputs, including the cylinder<br>
pressure and crankshaft torque (TotalCrankTorq) using the equations and<br>
calibrations described hereinabove during ongoing operation, when the control<br>
scheme is enabled to do so.<br>
[0035] Alternate embodiments are allowable within the scope of the<br>
invention, including systems employing valve management devices such as<br>
variable cam phasing. In an embodiment employing variable cam phasing, the<br>
cam phasing is preferably locked into a park position during execution of the<br>
simulation model. The park position can be either a full cam advance<br>
position, or a full cam retard position, preferably the full cam retard position to<br>
minimize magnitude of compression pulses.<br><br>
