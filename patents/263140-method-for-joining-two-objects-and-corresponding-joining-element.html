METHOD FOR JOINING TWO OBJECTS AND CORRESPONDING JOINING ELEMENT<br>
The invention concerns a method for joining two objects and a corresponding joining element being applicable to the method, wherein the joining element consists at least partly of a material having thermoplastic properties and the method comprises the application of mechanical vibration, e.g. ultrasonic vibration.<br>
Publications WO 98/42988 and WO 00/79137 describe joining elements which consist at least partly of a material with thermoplastic properties and which are e.g. pin-shaped. Such a joining element is anchored in an object of a porous material by positioning it in a blind hole provided in the object or by forcing it through the surface of the object and by then applying mechanical vibration (e.g. ultrasonic vibration) to the joining element while simultaneously pressing it further into the object. Due to the mechanical vibration, the thermoplastic material of the joining element is liquefied at the surface of the joining element where this surface is pressed against the porous material and, in its liquid state is pressed into the pores of the porous material where it forms an anchorage on re-solidification. In the anchorage area, the porous material is interpenetrated by the thermoplastic material such that it constitutes an intricate positive connection between the two materials. Application of the mechanical vibration is effected by positioning a vibrating element, e.g. the sonotrode of an ultrasonic device, on the joining element (e.g. on the end of a pin-<br><br>
P2369PCT	04.07.05<br>
-2-<br>
shaped joining element), where it protrudes from the object in which it is to be anchored.<br>
Publication WO 96/01377 describes a method for joining two objects of a porous material with the aid of a dowel-shaped joining element consisting at least partly of a material having thermoplastic properties and with the aid of mechanical vibration. In each one of the objects to be joined, a blind hole is provided and one end of the joining element is positioned in each one of the blind holes. The two objects are then pressed towards each other in a direction which is substantially parallel to a line connecting the two ends of the joining element and, simultaneously, one of the objects is excited with mechanical vibration.<br>
According to WO 96/01377 the two blind holes and the two ends of the joining element are similar and the length of the joining element corresponds substantially to the total depth of the two blind holes. The two ends of the joining element and the two blind holes provided in the two objects are conical and the joining element and blind holes are dimensioned such that when positioning the joining element in the blind holes, the joining element does not reach to the, bottom of the blind holes and therefore there remains a gap between the two objects. The joining action is carried out by positioning the assembly of the two objects and the joining element between a non-vibrating support and an element which is capable of being excited to mechanically vibrate, e.g. the sonotrode of an ultrasonic device. The excitable element and the support are forced towards each other by e.g. pressing the excitable element onto the one of the objects, and simultaneously, the excitable element is vibrated. On pressing and vibrating, the thermoplastic material of the joining element is liquefied where it is in contact with the walls of the blind holes and the joining element is forced deeper into the blind holes, whereby the gap between the parts is reduced. As soon as the gap is closed no more pressure can be applied to the joining element and the joining action is therefore finished. The thermoplastic material<br><br>
P2369 PCT	04.07.05<br>
-3-<br>
which, during vibration, is liquefied infiltrates into the porous object material and anchors the joining element in the two objects.<br>
With the above briefly described joining method according to the publication WO 96/01377 satisfactory results can be achieved in very specific cases only. In order to be applicable in a more general manner, it needs improvement.<br>
It is therefore the object of the invention to provide such improvement. This means, it is the object of the invention to create a joining method and a joining element for joining two (or possibly more than two) objects, wherein the joining element is used like a dowel, i.e. it is positioned in a recess provided between the two objects to be joined, e.g. in two opposite blind holes, wherein the joining element consists at least partly of a material having thermoplastic properties, wherein the method comprises the step of applying mechanical vibrations and wherein the joining element and the method according to the invention are to improve the dowel-like joining element and the corresponding joining method according to WO 96/01377 in such a way that, with their help, it becomes possible to satisfactorily join objects not only in very specific cases but much more generally.<br>
This object is achieved by the joining method and the joining element as defined in the claims.<br>
The invention is based on the finding that the strength of joints made according to the above mentioned joining method as described in publication WO 96/01377 is limited and that in most cases it is not possible to improve this strength by combining the teaching of WO 96/01377 with the teaching of WO 98/42988, i.e. by designing the joining element to be longer than the total of the depths of the two blind holes and by<br><br>
P2369 PCT	04.07.05<br>
-4-<br>
attempting to get a strong anchorage in the region of the two ends of the joining element. In most cases this is due to the fact that either the joining element is anchored in the object facing the excitable element in a satisfactory way while anchorage in the other object is not satisfactory, or the joining element end in the object facing the excitable element or the material surrounding this joining element end suffers from overheating,, while anchorage in the other object is either satisfactory or not even satisfactory. These findings can be explained at least partly by the fact that the vibration energy available at the proximal end of the joining element (end facing the excitable element) is greater than at the distal end of the joining element (end facing the non-vibrating support) and that therefore less material will be liquefied at the distal end than at the proximal end. This effect needs to be counterbalanced if it is not to render the joint quality unsatisfactory e.g. by unsatisfactory anchorage at the distal joining element. The named energy asymmetry is due to several factors, of which only two are named. It is due to the proximal end of the joining element being positioned nearer to the source of the vibration than the distal end (less damping). It is further due to the need of the mechanical vibration to reach the distal joining element end by being transmitted through the joining element itself, wherein the characteristics for vibration transmission are not optimal, particularly when there is liquefied material at the proximal end of the joining element.<br>
One obvious way for preventing the above named asymmetry consists in joining the two objects with the help of the joining element in two steps, namely positioning the joining element in the recess of the one of the objects and anchoring it in this recess according to the teaching of the publication WO-98/42988 and then to position the second element on the proximal end of the joining element and applying the vibrational energy to the second object for anchoring the joining element in the second object also. However, such two step method needs more time for the complete joining action and more complicated devices if it needs to be carried our<br><br>
P2369 PCT	04.07.05<br>
-5-<br>
fully automatically. Therefore, such two step method is not the inventive solution to the problem.<br>
The quality, in particular the mechanical strength of an anchorage effected by mechanical vibration as described above, depends in particular on how much and how deeply thermoplastic material infiltrates into pores or other suitable openings in the material in which a joining element is to be anchored. This feature not only depends on the method parameters such as applied pressing force, vibrational energy (dependent on amplitude and frequency) being coupled into the system and time during which the vibrational energy is applied, but it also depends to a considerable degree on the joining element and recess being provided for the joining element between the objects, in particular on the design of the surfaces of joining element and recess being pressed against each other, on the resistance which the object material raises against being interpenetrated, displaced and/or compressed by the liquefied material, and on the capability of the joining element to be vibrationally coupled to the excited element and to transmit such vibration.<br>
According to the invention the effect of the above named asymmetry regarding vibration energy available at the two joining element ends during the joining action is counterbalanced by at least one of the following measures:<br>
The two ends of the joining element are different as regards design and/or material, e.g., regarding the size of the two joining element faces which are pressed against the recess surfaces, regarding the amount of material having thermoplastic properties being available for liquefaction and/or regarding the thermoplastic properties of this material (asymmetric joining element);<br>
The two recess faces against which the joining element ends are pressed (e.g. bottom faces of the two blind holes) are different as regards design and/or<br><br>
-6-<br>
material, e.g., regarding the size of the two recess faces against which the joining element ends are pressed and/or, regarding resistance against interpenetration, compression and/or displacement by the liquefied material (asymmetric recess bottom faces);<br>
The joining element is designed to allow improved coupling of mechanical vibration from the object facing the excitable element during at least part of the joining action (asymmetric anchoring action).<br>
By applying at least one of the above named measures and therewith adapting the joining element and/or the recess provided for the joining element, it becomes possible to achieve satisfactory joints for a much wider range of applications than is possible by using the teaching of the publication WO 96/01377. However, for each different application, experiments are to be carried out to find optimum conditions for achieving a joint as desired.<br>

between the two objects to be joined. Joining element and objects to be joined are shown in section parallel to the direction of the applied pressing force, i.e. parallel to a line connecting the proximal and the distal joining element ends. The two objects are e.g. wooden boards or chipboard elements or consist of another porous material. The assembly is shown both before application of pressure and vibration (left hand side) and after application of pressure and vibration (right hand side).<br>
For joining the two objects 1 and 2 they are positioned between a support 3 and an excitable element 4 (e.g. sonotrode of an ultrasonic device), the first object 1 on the side of the support 3 and the second object 2 on the side of the excitable element 4. The two blind holes 5 and 6 provided one in each object are facing each other and the joining element 8 is positioned in the blind holes 5 and 6, its distal end 8.1 sitting on the bottom face of blind hole 5 in the first object 1, its proximal end 8.2 sitting on the bottom face of blind hole 6 in the second object 2. As the joining element 8 is longer than the total depths of the two blind holes 5 and 6, there remains a gap 9 between the two objects 1 and 2. As mentioned above, the two blind holes 5 and 6 may have the same depth or different depths.<br>
The joining element 8 as shown in Fig. 1 consists of a material having thermoplastic properties and has a distal end 8.1 which differs from its proximal end 8.2 by a distal bore 10 rendering the distal face area smaller than the proximal face area and rendering the amount of material having thermoplastic properties smaller at the distal end than at the proximal one. When the excitable element 4 is vibrated (double arrow) and pressed on the second object 2 (single arrow), the vibration is coupled to the second object 2 to cause liquefaction of the thermoplastic joining element material in the area of the proximal end face of the joining element. Such liquefaction will lessen the vibrational energy coupled into the joining element 8 and thus reduce the vibrational energy available at the distal end face to effect liquefaction. This effect is compensated by the distal end face being smaller than the<br><br>
P2369 PCT	04.07.05<br>
-9-<br>
proximal end face resulting in a larger distal pressing force per unit area which facilitates liquefaction of the thermoplastic material at the distal end and helps to equalise interpenetration of liquefied thermoplastic into the porous material of the first object 1 as compared to interpenetration into the porous material of the second object 2 at the proximal joining element end. This means that at the proximal end 8.2 of the joining element 8 more vibrational energy for liquefaction is available but there is less pressure per unit area for pressing the thermoplastic material into the object material than is the case at the distal end 8.1 where there is less vibrational energy available but more force to press the material into the object. If the differing effects are balanced together with the method parameters (pressing force, vibration energy and application time), the resulting joint (right hand part of Fig. 1) comprises distal and proximal anchorage areas 15 and 16 of about the same strength, a result which cannot be achieved using a symmetric joining element in identical blind holes.<br>
The joining element 8 of Fig. 1 consists completely of a material with thermoplastic properties, e.g. of ABS (acryl-butyl-styrene) which may include strengthening fibres or whiskers. If, during vibrating, the whole joining element is warmed or, in the last instances of vibrating, is brought into a plastic state, it will then shrink upon cooling and create a tension which pulls the two objects against each.other.<br>
Figure 2 shows a further exemplary embodiment of a joining element comprising a proximal1 end face which is larger than the distal end face. The joining element 8 is shown positioned in two identical blind holes (before application of pressure and vibration). Same elements are designated with same reference numerals as in Fig. 1. Instead of a central distal bore 10 as shown in Fig. 1, the embodiment according to Fig. 2 comprises two (or more) coaxial cylindrical portions, wherein the distal portion has a smaller cross section than the proximal cross section and there is a step between the two sections.<br><br>
P2369 PCT	04.07.05<br>
-10-<br>
Figure 3 shows an embodiment of the method according to the invention (only shown before application of pressure and vibration) in which it is not the joining element which is asymmetric to achieve a larger pressure at the distal joining element end 8.1 but the recess bottom faces. The inner recess face against which the distal joining element end 8.1 is pressed is smaller than the inner recess face against which the proximal joining element end 8.2 is pressed. The joining element 8 has the form of a full or hollow cylinder, and therefore its distal end face is of an equal size as the proximal one, but it sits on a smaller surface area of the recess, namely only on a shoulder 20 thereof.<br>
Figure 4 shows a combination of the embodiments according to Figs 2 and 3, namely a stepped joining element 8 (proximal end face 8.2 larger than distal end face 8.1) positioned in two different blind holes (blind hole 5 in first object 1 with smaller bottom face than blind hole 6 in second object 2). The joining element 8 and the two objects 1 and 2 to be joined are shown before application of pressure and vibration.<br>
Other embodiments of the inventive method in which the effective distal end face of the joining element 8 is reduced by a correspondingly reduced inner recess face, against which the distal end face of the joining element is pressed, may e.g. comprise a blind hole bottom face with a protruding cone or other protrusion on which a substantially even joining element end face sits.<br>
Figure 5 shows another embodiment of the method according to the invention (only distal end 8.1 of joining element 8 in blind hole 5 of first object 1 shown; before application of vibration and pressure) in which again the effective distal face area of the joining element 8 is smaller than the proximal one. Here the joining element 8 comprises a distal insert 21 of a material which is not liquefiable and preferably not porous or considerably less porous than the object material and which distal insert<br><br>
P2369 PCT	04.07.05<br>
-11-<br>
constitutes the distal end face of the joining element. Facing towards the proximal end of the joining element 8, the distal insert 21 comprises a cross section reduction e.g. in form of a shoulder 21.1 and a connecting part 21.2 having a cross section which is smaller than the distal end face. The connecting part 21.2 reaches into a central bore 10 of a joining element rest part 8' being made of the material having thermoplastic properties, wherein the connecting part 21.2 of the insert is held in bore 10 by e.g. a press fit. Bore 10 is preferably longer than the connecting part 21.1.<br>
On application of pressure and vibration, the distal insert 21 acts as the bottom face of the blind hole 5, wherein, on the side of the joining element 8, the distal face area is reduced by the central bore 10 and, on the side of the hole, the shoulder 21.1 only counteracts the pressing force. The material being liquefied at the distal end of the joining element infiltrates sideways (arrows) into the material of the first object 1. This means that the embodiment according to Fig. 5 is a combination of the embodiment according to Fig. 1 and the embodiment according to Fig. 4, wherein the advantage of this embodiment is the fact that there is less empty space into which the liquefied material can be pressed without much resistance and without anchorage effect and still the blind hole can have a cylindrical form which is the easiest one to be realized.<br>
Figure 6 shows a further embodiment of the method according to the invention (only shown before application of pressure and vibration) in which the joining element 8 is asymmetric regarding the thermoplastic properties of the material. This joining element is used in connection with two identical blind holes (symmetric recess). The asymmetric joining element 8 comprises a distal part 8.3 and a proximal part 8.4 wherein'the distal part comprises a first material having thermoplastic properties and the proximal part comprises a second material having thermoplastic properties and wherein liquefaction of the first material can be effected with less energy than liquefaction of the second material (first material having a lower liquefaction<br><br>
P2369 PCT	04.07.05<br>
-12-<br>
temperature than second material), such that about the same amount of material is liquefied with the lesser vibration energy available at the distal end of the joining element in comparison with the material liquefied by the greater vibration energy available at the proximal end thereof. The joint achieved with this method shows equal qualities of the anchorage at the distal and proximal end of the joining element.<br>
A similar effect as achieved with the joining element according to Fig. 6 can be achieved with a joining element having identical distal end and proximal end geometries but in which the thermoplastic material at the distal end is porous, while the thermoplastic material at the proximal end is non-porous (or more porous against less porous), or in which the thermoplastic material at the distal end has a smaller density than at the proximal end, or in which the thermoplastic material at the distal end contains more of a non-thermoplastic filling material than at the proximal end (or contains such filling material against no filling material).<br>
Figure 7 shows a further embodiment of the method according to the invention (only shown before application of pressure and vibration), in which the two object materials in the region of the recess surfaces constitute the necessary asymmetry by having different properties regarding resistance against interpenetration, compression and/or displacement by the liquefied material. The material of the first object 1 has a higher porosity and/or a lesser mechanical stability than the material of the second object 2. The joining element 8 is symmetric and consists of a material having thermoplastic properties. Due to the difference in the object materials, a higher percentage of the lesser amount of liquefied material available at the distal joining element end infiltrates into the material, while at the proximal end, there is more liquefied material of which due to the higher resistance presented by the object material a lesser percentage infiltrates into the object material. This again leads to a symmetric joint showing anchorage of about the same strength at the distal and proximal ends of the joining element 8. The object material difference does not<br><br>
P2369 PCT	04.07.05<br>
-13-<br>
necessarily include the whole of the two objects. It is sufficient if the two object materials show the named differences in the area of the recess, where the joining element ends 8.1 and 8.2 are pressed against the object material.<br>
Figure 8 shows a further embodiment of the method according to the invention (shown only before application of pressure and vibration) which works on the same principle as the embodiment according to Fig. 7. Here the material of the first object 1 is substantially non-porous but the recess in this object is provided with suitable geometries as. e.g. undercuts 22 into which the liquefied material infiltrates and constitutes a positive fit connection when re-solidified. Such geometries present less resistance against being filled with liquefied material i or necessitate less liquidity of the material than the pores of the material of the second object 2, which effect again counterbalances the effects of the lesser vibration energy available at the distal joining element end. Of course, for certain applications it may be necessary to reverse the asymmetric materials, i.e. to have the less-porous or nonporous material with positive-fit geometries on the proximal side, and the more-porous material on the distal side, possibly with other asymmetric characteristics to permit a bond with satisfactory strength on the distal side. However, the same principle of positive-fit bond geometry in a less-porous or nonporous material applies.<br>
Figure 9 shows a further embodiment of the method according to the invention (shown only after application of pressure and vibration) which again works in the same way as the embodiments shown in Figs. 7 and 8. The two objects 1 and 2 are chipboard elements being coated with a compact layer 30 of e.g. melamine, wherein the chipboard elements are to be joined to form a corner, i.e. the blind hole extending parallel to the melamine layers in the first chipboard element 1 and perpendicular to them in the second one 2. The blind hole 6 in the second chipboard element 2 has a depth such that it reaches substantially to just underneath the opposite melamine layer 30, such having a bottom face which is not porous and which therefore cannot<br><br>
P2369PCT	04.07.05<br>
-14-<br>
be interpenetrated nor displaced or compressed by the liquefied material. As seen from Fig. 9, the liquefied material infiltrates sideways into the chipboard material at the proximal joining element end 8.2 while at the distal joining element end 8.1 it infiltrates into the chipboard material much more in the direction of the pressing force.<br>
Figure 10 shows a further embodiment of the method according to the invention (shown only before application of pressure and vibration) in which the asymmetry regarding the vibration energy available at the distal and proximal end of the joining element 8 is not counterbalanced by a further asymmetry of the joining element and/or the recess but is counterbalanced by a design of the joining element 8 which improves transmission of mechanical vibration from the second object to the distal joining element end in a second phase of the joining action (asymmetric anchoring action). The joining element 8 comprises a central part 8.5 carrying a distal end cap 8.6 and a proximal end cap 8.7, the central part consisting of a substantially non-porous material being suitable for transmitting mechanical vibration (little damping) and the end caps 8.6 and 8.7 consisting of thei material having thermoplastic properties. The end caps 8.6 and-8.7 are fixed to the central part 8.5 preferably by a positive fit connection (not shown). At least the proximal end cap 8.7 is designed with a minimum thickness of its face part such that it contains just enough material to constitute good anchorage in the second object 2 and to constitute a good connection with the central part 8.5.<br>
On application of pressure and vibration to the assembly as shown in Fig. 10 the material of the proximal end cap 8.7 is liquefied and infiltrates into e.g. pores of the second object 2 until the proximal end of the central part 8.5 abuts with the bottom face of blind hole 6. Such abutment and the effect of the pressing force will enhance transmission of vibration from the excitable element (not shown) via the second<br><br>

object 2 to the joining clement 8 and in particular to its distal end where it will cause, in a second phase of the joining action, liquefaction of the distal end cap material 8.6.<br>
If the central part 8.5 of the joining element 8 according to Fig. 10 is made of a material having a sufficient mechanical stiffness, this central part 8.5 also serves for improving stability of the effected joint against shearing forces (arrows S)<br>
While the embodiments of the method as shown in Figs 1 to 9 rely on geometrical or material asymmetry of joining element and/or recess, the embodiment according to Fig. 10 relies on asymmetry regarding the anchoring action. The proximal and distal anchorages are not effected simultaneously but at least partly in succession.<br>
All embodiments shown in Figs 1 to 10 show two blind holes 5 and 6 being provided one in each object. This is not a condition for the method according to the invention, which asks in a general sense for a recess to be provided between the two objects in which the joining element 8 is positioned such that its proximal and distal ends sit against inner recess faces and such that there remains a gap between the two objects.<br>
Figures 11 and 12 show further embodiments of the method according to the invention, wherein the recess to be provided between the two objects 1 and 2 is realized as one blind hole 6 in the second object 2 and a protrusion 5' on the first object 1, wherein hole 6 and protrusion 5' have matching cross sections. Depth of blind hole 6, height of protrusion 5' and length of joining element 8 are matched such that when the joining element 8 is positioned in the blind hole 6 and the protrusion 5' is positioned in the blind hole also, there remains a gap 9 between the two objects 1 and 2, which gap corresponds substantially with the amount of thermoplastic material to be displaced into the object material or into corresponding<br><br>

-16-<br>
hollow geometries of blind hole 6 or protrusion 5*. Of course it is also possible to arrange the blind hole in the first object and the protrusion on the second object.<br>
According to Fig. 11, which shows only the assembly of objects 1 and 2 and joining element 8 before application of pressure and vibration, both objects comprise a porous material and the joining element 8 has a distal end face smaller than its proximal one (method as shown also in Fig. 1). Fig. 12 shows on the left hand side object 1 with protrusion 5', symmetric joining element 8 and second object 2 with blind hole 6 to be assembled essentially as shown in Fig 11 and on the right hand side the joint being effected by applying pressure and vibration to the assembly. The second object 2 comprises a porous material and the first object 1 a material with no pores or with substantially fewer pores than the material of the second object. Instead the circumferential surface of the protrusion 5' is equipped with grooves 30, running e.g. in a criss-cross pattern and being open towards the protrusion face such that thermoplastic material being liquefied at the distal joining element face infiltrates into the grooves 31 and creates a positive fit connection between the walls of blind hole 6 and protrusion 5' as indicated with 32 on the right hand side of Fig. 12. As the joining element 8 in the present case is a symmetric one, care is to be taken that the resistance against liquefied material infiltrating into the grooves 31 remains smaller than the resistance of the second object material against interpenetration by the liquefied material. If this cannot be achieved, an asymmetric joining element is to be used (e.g. containing a central bore at its distal end).<br>
In all the embodiments of the method according to the invention as shown in Figs. 1 to 12 it is assumed that the joining element has the form of a pin whose cross section may be e.g. round, oval, square, rectangular, triangular or of any polygonic shape with straight, concave or convex sides. It proves to be advantageous to equip the circumferential surface of the joining element with axial ribs which contribute guidance of the joining element in the recess and which add to the connection<br><br>

strength at the joining element ends by providing (additional anchorage material (greater area).<br>
However, it is no condition of the method according to the invention that the joining element must be pin-shaped. All Figs 1 to 12, being sections parallel to the direction of the pressing force, can be understood also as cross sections through joining elements having a longitudinal extension perpendicular to the pressing force direction, i.e. having the form of tongues, and being positioned in groves having the same cross sections as the blind holes shown in Figs 1 to 10 or in one blind hole to be closed by a further tongue having the same cross sections as the blind holes and protrusions according to Figs 11 and 12.<br>
Figure 13 shows such a tongue-shaped joining element being positioned in two opposite grooves (recess between objects to be joined). The illustrated method is substantially the same as the one illustrated by Fig. 1 (asymmetric joining element having smaller distal end face than proximal one). As indicated by the plurality of double arrows, it is advantageous to apply vibration to the whole length of object 2 in order to achieve homogeneous anchorage in the two objects over the whole length of the tongue-shaped joining element 8.<br>
Figure 14 illustrates a further way in which a similar joint is achieved as with the tongue-shaped joining element according to Fig. 13. The first object 1 is equipped with a row of blind holes 5 in which a plurality of substantially pin-shaped joining elements 8 are positioned. The second object 2 is equipped with a groove 33 dimensioned to accommodate the proximal ends of the joining elements. The second element is positioned for joining, is then laterally adjusted to fit exactly on the first object 1 and only then mechanical vibration is applied to the second object 2 for joining the two objects. The embodiment as shown in Fig. 14 is considerably less<br><br>

-18-<br>
demanding regarding accuracy than an embodiment in which blind holes are provided in both objects for a plurality of joining elements, wherein corresponding blind holes in the two parts need to be aligned accurately in two directions.<br>
Figure 15 illustrates again the method as principally shown in Fig. 1 applied for joining two chipboard elements (objects 1 and 2) to form a corner element. As already shown in Fig. 9, the blind hole 5 in the first object 1 extends parallel to and about midway between the chipboard surfaces and blind hole 6 in the second object 2 extends perpendicular to the chip board surface and reaches beyond the middle of it. The density of chipboard is usually lower in a centre region than in outer regions and its mechanical stability is greater in a direction perpendicular to the surfaces than parallel to them. For this reason there is a first asymmetry in the case shown in Fig. 14 regarding the object material, which for the first object 1 has a smaller mechanical stability and a higher porosity than for the second object 2. This asymmetry is more pronounced the more blind hole 6 reaches beyond the middle of the chipboard element representing object 2. However, this asymmetry proves to be insufficient and therefore, the joining element 8 is designed to be asymmetric also. For improved mechanical stability as compared with the substantially compact joining elements according to the previous Figs, the present joining element 8 is designed as cylindrical tube with an inner cross section to be larger at the distal end 8.1 than at the proximal end 8.2, thus rendering the ring-shaped distal face area smaller than the ring-shaped proximal face area and with more material having thermoplastic properties at the proximal end 8.2 of the joining element 8 than at the distal end 8.1. Depending on the object material, it proves advantageous to design the face areas not completely even (perpendicular to a joining element axis) but rather with a slope relative to a plane perpendicular to the joining element axis which slope forms a sharpened circular edge at the proximal and distal faces. This edge is pressed into the object material of the bottom face of the blind holes by the pressing force and initiates liquefaction. The effective face area is considered to be the one at the level (dash-dotted lines A and B) to which such initial pressing-in is effected.<br><br>

The circumferential surface of the joining element according to Fig. 15 is equipped with axially extending ribs 35.<br>
The joining element according to Fig. 15 can easily be manufactured by injection moulding. Its middle portion can easily be designed such that the centre of gravity is considerably displaced from a position at half axial length such that the joining element can be oriented correctly (proximal/distal) by gravity.<br>
Fig. 16 shows a similar joining element 8 as Fig. 15, which in addition comprises a core 40 which is made of a material having more mechanical strength than the thermoplastic material of the outer joining element shell. The core 40 is e.g. made of wood and serves in particular for improving the joint stability against shearing forces. The core 4, if placed accordingly near to the proximal end of the joining element may also assume the function as discussed for the central joining element part 8.5 of the joining element according to Fig. 10.<br>
Fig. 17 shows a further example of a joining element 8 according to the invention, which is similar to the embodiment as shown in Figs. 15 and 16 but has a non-symmetrical cross section.<br>
Fig. 18 shows a further example of a joining element 8 according to the invention. The joining element is in function similar to the joining elements as shown in Figs. 1, 15, 16 and 17 (asymmetric geometry), but it is not hollow and has an angular (square or rectangular) cross section.<br>

The joining element 8 comprises a distal part 8.8 and a proximal part 8.9, both having the form of a hollow cylinder wherein the distal part 8.8 has a smaller diameter and an outer thread and the proximal part 8.9 has a larger diameter and an inner thread adapted to the outer thread of the distal part 8.8. The length of the joining element 8 is adjusted by screwing the distal part 8.8 correspondingly far into the proximal part 8.9. Instead of the threads the two joining element parts 8.8. and 8.9 can be equipped with snap elements such that they can be snapped together in a plurality of different axial positions.<br><br>
