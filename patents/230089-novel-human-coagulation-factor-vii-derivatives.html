COAGULATION FACTOR VII DERIVATIVES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel human coagulation Factor VII derivatives. Factor VII polypeptides, as well as polynucleotide constructs encoding such polypeptides, vectors and host cells comprising and expressing the polynucleotide, pharmaceutical compositions comprising Factor VII derivatives, uses and methods of treatment<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Blood coagulation Is a process consisting of a complex Interaction of various blood components (or factors) that eventually gives raise to a fibrin clot Generally, the blood components; which participate in what has been referred to as the coagulation 'cascade', are enzymatlcally inactive proteins (proenzymes or zymogens) that are converted to proteolytic enzymes by the action of an activator (which itself Is an activated dotting factor). Coagulation factors that have undergone such a conversion are generally refierred to as 'active factors', and are designated by the addition of theletter "a" to the name of the coagulation factor (e.g. Factor Vila).<br>
Initiation of the haemostatib process is method by the formation of a demplex between tissue factor, exposed as a result of injury to the vessel wall, and Factor Vila. This complex then converts Factors IX and X to their active fomis. Factor Xa converts limited amounts of prothrombin to thrombin on the tissue factor-bearing cell. Thrombin activates platelets and Factors V and VIII into Factors Va and Villa, both cofactors in the further process leading to the full thrombin burst This process includes generation of Factor Xa by Factor IXa. On complex with factor Villa) and occurs on the surface of activated platelets. Thrombin finally converts fibrinogen to fibrin resulting In fonnation of a fibrin dot.<br>
Factor VII is a trace plasma glycoprotein thai circulates in blood as a single-chain zymogen The zymogen Is catalytically Inactive. Single-chain Factor VII may be converted to two-chain Factor Vila by Factor Xa, Factor Xlla, Factor IXa. Factor Vila thrombin in vitro. Factor Xa is believed to be the major physiological activator of Factor VII. The conversion of zymogen Factor VII into the activated two-chain molecule occurs by cleavage of an internal Argi6rltei53 peptide bond.<br>
It is often desirable to stimulate or to selectively block the coagulation cascade in a subject Factor Vila has been used to control bleeding disorders that have several causes such as dotting factor deficiencies (e.g. haemophilia A and B or deficiency of coagulation Factors XI or VII) or dotting factor inhibitors. Factor Vila has also been used to control ex-<br><br>
cessive bleeding occunring in subjects with a normally functioning blood dotting cascade (no clotting factor deficiendes or inhibitors against any of the coagulation factors). Such bleeding may, for example, be caused by a defective platelet fundion, thrombocytopenia or von Wille-brand's disease. Bleeding is also a major problem in connection with surgery and other forms of tissue damage.<br>
European Patent No. 200,421 (ZymoGenetics) relates to the nucleotide sequerice^ encoding human Fador VII and the recombinant expression of Fador VII in mammalian cells.<br>
Dickinson et al. {Proc. Natl, Acad. ScL USA 93,14379-14384,1996) relates to Factor VII polypeptides wherein Lys157, Val158, Glu296. Met298, Asp334. Ser336 or Lys337 have been individually replaced by Ala. Iwanaga et al. (TTrromix.Hgemost (supplement au-' gust 1999), 486, abstract 1474) relates to FactorVlla variants wherein residues 316-320 are deleted or residues 311-322 are replaced with the ccresponding residues from trypsin.<br>
Anticoagulants such as heparin, coumarin, derivatives of coumarin. indandione derivatives, or other agents may be used to selectively block the coagulation cascade in a patient, for example, during kidney dialysis, or to treat deep vein thrombosis, disseminated in-  .<br>
travascular coagulation (DIC).and a host of other medical disorder. For example,.heparin<br>
treatment or extracorporeal treatment with citrate ion (U.S. Pat No. 4,500,309) may be used In dialysis to prevent coagulation during thecourse of treatment. Heparin is also used in preventing deep vein thrombosis in patients undergoing surgery.<br>
Treatment with heparin and other anticoagulants may, however, have undesirable side effects. Available anticoagulants generally act throughout thebody, rather than acting specificaily at a dot site. Heparin, for example, may cause heavy bleeding. Furthermore, with a half-life of approximately 80 minutes, heparin is rapidly deared from the blood. necessitating frequent administration. Because heparin acts as a cofactor for antithrombln 111 (AT 111), and AT 111 is rapidly depleted in DIG treatment, it Is often difficult to maintain theproper heparin dosage, necessitating continuous monitoring of AT III and heparin levels. Heparin Is also ineffective if AT III depletion is extreme. Further, prolonged use of heparin may also increase platelet aggregation and reduce platelet count, and has been Implicated In the development of osteoponosis. Indandione derivatives may also have toxic side effects.<br>
In addition to the articoagufants briefly described above, several naturally occurring proteins have been found to have anticoagulant activity. For example. Reutelingsperger (U.S. Pat. No. 4.736,018) isolated anticoagulant proteins from bovine aorta and human umbilical vein arteries. Maki etal. (U.S. Pat No. 4,732,691) disclose human plabenta-derived anticoagulant proteins. In addition, AT III has been proposed as a therapeutic anticoagulant<br><br>
(Schipper et a!.. Lancet 1 (8069): 854-856 (1978); Jordan, U.S. Pat No. 4.386,025; Bock et a!.. U.S. Pat No. 4.517.294).<br>
In about 30% or more of patients treated by angioplasty, endarterectomy or bypass grafts, thrombosis and/or smooth muscle cell proliferation in the intima causes re-occlusion of the vessel and consequent failure of the reconstructive surgery. This closure of the vessel subsequent to surgery is known as restenosis. Restenosis is thought to result from a complex interaction of bidogical processes including platelet deposition and thrombus formation, release of chemotactic and mitogenic factors, and the migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells into the intima of the dilated arterial segment.<br>
The inhibition of platelet accumulation at sites of mechanical injury can limit the rate of restenosis in human subjects. While platelet accumulation occurs at sites of acute vascu- lar injuries, thegeneration of thrombin at these sites may be responsible for the activation of the platelets and their subsequent accumulation.<br>
International Application No. WO-92/15686 relates to inactivated Factor Vila, poly-nucleic acid and mammalian cell lines for the production of inactivated Factor Vila, and compositions comprising inactivated Factor Vila for inhibiting blood coagulation.<br>
International Application No. WO 94/27631 relates to methods for inhibiting vascular restenosis, tissue factor activity, and platelet deposition.<br>
International Application No. WO 96/12800 relates to a method for treatment of acute closure of a coronary artery comprising to the individual a composition which comprises inactivated Factor Vila In conjunction with tissue plasminogen activator or streptokinase.<br>
Most proteins intiroduced into the circulation, are cleared quickly from tine mammalian subject by the kidneys. This problem may be partially overcome by administering a larger amount of the protein or through  repeated administration. However, higher doses of the protein can elicit antibodies which can bind and inactivate the protein and/or facilitate the clearance of the protein from thesubject's body. Repeated administration of the therapeutic protein is essentially ineffective and can be dangerous as it can elicit an allergic response.<br>
Various attempts to solve the problems associated with protein therapies include microencapsulation, liposome delivery systems, administration effusion proteins, and chemical modification. The most promising of these to date is modification of the therapeutic protein by covalent attachment of potyalkylene oxide polymers, particulariy polyethylene glycols (PEG). For example. U.S. Pat No. 4,179.337 discloses the use of PEG or polypropylene glycol coupled to proteins to provide a physiologically active non-immunogenic water soluble polypeptide composition. Nucd et al. describe several proteins which have been modified by addition of PEG including adenosine deamidase. L-asparaginase, interferon alpha 2b (IFN-<br><br>
a2b), superoxide dismutase, streptokinase, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), urokinase, uricase, hemoglobin, interieukins, interferons, TGF-beta, EGF, and other growth factors (Nucd et a!., 1991. adv.Drug.  Delivery Rev. 4:133-151). Attempts such as these have resulted in somewhat longer half-life of the proteins and reduction of protein Immunogenicity.<br>
Typically, PEGylation of proteins involves activating PEG with a functional group which will react with lysine residues on the surface of the protein. If the modification of the protein goes to completion, the activity of the protein is usually lost Modification procedures. which allow partial PEGylation of the protein usually result in only about 50% loss of activity and greatly increased serum half-life, so that the overall effective dose of the protein is lower.<br>
Recent developments in protein PEGylation methods employ activated PEG reagents which react with thiol groups of the protein, resulting in covalent attachment of PEG to a cysteine, which residue was inserted in place of a naturally occurring lysine of the protein. Shaw et al. (U.S. Pat No. 5,166,322) describe specific variants of IL-3 which have a cysteine introduced at specific sites within the naturally occurring amino acid sequence, Sulfhydryf reactive compounds (e.g. activated polyethylene glycol) are then attached to these cysteines by reaction with the IL-3 variant Katre et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5.206.344) describe specific IL-2<br>
variants which contain a cysteine introduced at a specific site within the naturally occurring<br><br>
amino acid sequence. The IL-2 variant is subsequently reacted with an activated polythyl<br>
ene glycol reagent to attach this moiety to a cysteine.<br>
There is still a need in the art for improved Factor VII polypeptides having prolonged procoagulant or anticoagulant activity. In particular, there is a need for Factor VII polypeptides which has increased serum half-life without the undesirable side effects such as systemic activation of the coagulation system and bleeding, respectively, associated with conventional therapies, and which can be administered at relatively low doses so that repeated administrations of a larger amount of the protein are avoided.<br>

The term "treatmenf, as used herein, means theadministration of an effective amount of a therapeutically active compound of the invention with the purpose of preventing any symptoms or disease state to develop or with the purpose of curing or easing such symptoms or diseasestates already developed. The term "treatment" is thus meant to Include prophylactic treatment.<br>
The temn "enhancement of the normal haemostatic system" means an enhancement o the ability to generate thrombin.<br>
As used herein the temn "bleeding disorders" reflects any defect, congenital, acquired or induced, of cellular or molecular origin that is manifested in bleedings. Examples are clotting factor deficiencies (e.g. haemophilia A and B or deficiency of coagulation Factors XI or VII), clotting factor inhibitors, defective platelet function, thrombocytopenia or von Wlllebrand's disease.<br>
The term "bleeding episodes" is meant to include uncontrolled and excessive bleed ing which is a major problem both in connection with surgery and other fomis of tissue damage. Uncontrolled and excessive bleeding may occur in subjects having a normal coagulatior system and subjects having coagulation or bleeding disorders. Clotting factor deficiencies (haemophilia A and B, deficiency of coagulation factors XI or VII) or clotting factor inhibitors may be the cause of bleeding disorders. Excessive bleedings also occur in subjects with a normally functioning blood clotting cascade (no clotting factor deficiencies or -inhibitors against any of the coagulation factors) and may be caused by a defective platelet function, thrombocytopenia or von Willebrand's disease. In such cases, thebleedings may be similar<br><br>
to those bleedings caused by haemophilia because the haemostatic system, as in haemophilia, lacks or has abnormal essential clotting "compounds" (such as platelets or von Wille-brand factor protein) that causes major bleedings. In subjects who experience extensive tissue damage in association with surgery or vast trauma, the nomial haemostatic mechanism may be oven^elmed by the demand of immediate haemostasis and they may develop bleeding in spite of a normal haemostatic mechanism. Achieving satisfactory haenrx^stasis also is a problem when bleedings occur in organs such as the brain, inner ear region and eyes with limited possibility for surgical haenDOstasis. The same problem may arise in the process of taking biopsies from various organs (liver, lung, tumour tissue, gastrointestinal tract) as well as in (aparoscopic surgery. Common for all these situations is the difficulty to provide haemostasis by surgical techniques (sutures, dips, etc.) which also is the case when bleeding is diffuse (haemorrhagic gastritis and profuse uterine bleeding); Acute and profuse bleedings may also occur in subjects on anticoagulant therapy in whom a defective haemostasis has been induced by the therapy given. Such subjects may need surgical interventions in case the anticoagulant effect has to be counteracted rapidly. Radical retropubic prostatectomy is a commonly performed procedure for subjects with localized prostate cancer. The operation is frequently complicated by significant and sometimes massive blood loss. The considerable blood loss during prostatectomy is mainly related to the complicated anatomical situation, with various densely vascularized sites that are not easily accessible for surgical haemostasis, and which may result in diffuse bleeding from a large area. Another situation that may cause problems in the case of unsatisfactory haemostasis Is when subjects with a nonnal haemostatic mechanism are given anticoagulant therapy to prevent thromboembolic disease. Such therapy may include heparin, other forms of proteoglycans, warfarin or other fomns of vitamin K-antagonists as well as aspirin and other platelet aggregation inhibitors.<br>

In the present specification, amino adds are represented using abbreviations, as indicated fn table 1, approved by lUPAOlUB Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature (CBN). Amino acid and the like having isomers represented by name or the following abbre* viat'ons are in natural L-form unless otherwise Indicated. Further, the left and right ends of an amino add sequence of a peptide are, respectively, the N- and C-temiini unless othenvise specified.<br><br>
The invention also relates to a method of preparing human Fador VII polypeptides as mentioned above. The human Factor VII polypeptides are preferably produced by recombinant DNA techniques. To this end, DMA sequences encoding human Factor VII may be isolated by preparing a genomic or cDNA library and screening for DNA sequences coding for all or part of the protein by hybridization using synthetic oligonudeotide probes in accordance with standard techniques (cf. Sambrook et al.. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, CoW Spring Harbor Laboratory. Cold Spring Harbor, New Yoric, 1989). For the present purpose, the DNA sequence encoding the protein is preferably of human origin, i.e. derived from a human genomic DNA or cDNA library.<br>
The DNA sequences encoding the human Factor Vli polypeptides may also be prepared synthetically by established standard methods, e.g. the phosphoamidite method described by Beaucage and Caruthers, Tetrahedron Letters 22 (1981), 1859 -1869, or the method described by Matthes et al., EMBO Journal 3 (1984), 801 - 805. According to the<br><br>
phosphoamidite method, oligonucleotides are synthesized, e.g. in an automatic DMA synthesizer, purified, annealed, ligated and cloned in suitable vectors.<br>
The DNA sequences may also be prepared by polymerase chain reaction using specific primers, for instance as descnl)ed in US 4,683,202, SaiW et al., Science 239 (1988). 487 - 491, or Sambrook et al., supra.<br>
The DNA sequences encoding the human Factor VII polypeptides are usually inserted into a recombinant vector which may be any vector, which n^y conveniently be subjected to recombinant DNA procedures, and the choice of vector will often depend on the host cell into which it is to be introduced. Thus, the vector may be an autonomously replicating vector, i.e. a vector, which exists as an extrachromosomai entity, the replication of which is independent of chromosomal replication, e.g. a plasmid. Altematively, the vector nnay be one which, when introduced into a host cell, is integrated into the host cell genome and replicated together with the chronrK3Some(s) into which it has been Integrated,<br>
The vector is preferably an expression vector in which the DNA sequence encoding the human Factor VII polypeptides is operably linked to additional segments required for transcription of tine DNA In general, theexpression vector is derived from plasmid or viral DNA, or may contain elements of both. The term, "operably linked" indicates that the segments are arranged so that they function in concert for their intended purposes, e.g. transcription initiates in a promoter and proceeds through the DNA sequence coding for tine polypeptide..<br>
The promoter may be any DNA sequence, which shows transcriptional activity in the hpsf cell of choice and may be derived from genes encoding proteins either homologous or heterologous to thehost cell.<br>
Examples of suitable promoters for directing the transcription of theDNA encoding the human-Factor VII polypeptide in mammalian cells are the SV40 promoter (Subramanl et al., Moi. CeilBioi 1 (1981), 854 -864), theMT-1 (metallothionein gene) promoter (Palmtter et al.. Science 222 (1983), 809 - 814), the CMV promoter (Boshart et al.. Ce//41:521-530.1985) or theadenovirus 2 major late promoter (Kaufman and Sharp. Mo/. Ce//. Biol, 2:1304-1319, 1982).<br>
An example of a suitable promoter for use in insect cells is thepolyhedrin promoter (US 4,745,051; Vasuvedan et al., FEBS Lett, 311, (1992) 7-11), theP10 promoter (J.M. Vlak et al., J. Gen, Virology 69,1988, pp. 765-776). the Autographa califomica polyhedrosis virus basic protein promoter (EP 397 485), the baculovirus immediate early gene 1 promoter (US 5,155.037; US 5,162,222), or the baculovims 39K delayed-early gene promoter (US 5,155.037; US 5,162,222).<br>
Examples of suitable promoters for use in yeast host cells include promoters from yeast glycolytic genes (Hitzeman et al.. J. Biol. Cham, 255 (1980). 12073 - M030] Aiber and<br><br>
Kawasaki, J. Mo/. Appl. Gen. 1 (1982), 419 -434) or alcohol dehydrogenase genes (Young et al., in Genetic Engineering of Microorganisms for Chemicals (Hollaender et al. eds.). Plenum Press. New York. 1982), or the TPI1 {US 4.599,311) or ADH2-4c (Russell et a!.. Nature 304 (1983), 652 - 654) promoters.<br>
le J.<br>
I<br>
  r<br>
are the yeast plasmid 2|i replication genes REP 1-3 and origin of replication.<br>
The vector may also comprise a selectable mari<er. e.g. a gene the product of which complements defect in host cell such as coding for dihydrofolate reductase or schizosaccharomyces pombe tpi by p.r russell></er.><br>
1985, pp. 125-130). or one which confers resistance to a daig, e.g. ampidllin, kanamycin. tetracydin, chloramphenicol, neomydn, hygromydn or methotrexate. For filamentous fungi, selectable markers include andS, pyrG, argB, niaD or sC.<br>
To direct the human Factor VII polypeptides of the present invention into the secretory pathway of the host cells, a secretory signal sequence (also known as a leader sequence, prepro sequence or pre sequence) may be provided in the recombinant vedor. The secretory signal sequence is joined to the D^4A sequences encoding the human Factor VII polypeptides in the con^ct reading frame. Secretory signal sequences are commonly positioned 5' to the DMA sequence encoding the peptide. The secretory signal sequence may be that, normally assodated with the protein or may be from a gene encoding another secreted protein.<br>
For secretion from yeast cells, the secretory signal sequence may encode any signal peptide, whk;h ensures efficient direction of the expressed human Fador VII polypeptides into the secretory pathway of the cell. The signal peptide may be naturally occuning signal peptide, or a functional part thereof, or it may be a synthetic peptide. Suitable signal peptides have been found to be the a-factor signal peptide (cf. US 4.870,008), the signal peptide of mouse salivary amylase (cf. 0. Hagenbuchle etai.. Nature 289,1981, pp. 643-646), a modified carboxypeptidase signal peptide (cf. LA Vails et al.. Ce//48,1987. pp. 887-897), the yeast BAR1 signal peptide (cf. WO 87/02670). or the yeast aspartic protease 3 (YAP3) signal peptide (cf. M. Egel-Mitani et al.. Yeast 6.1990. pp. 127-137).<br>
For effident secretion in yeast, a sequence encoding a leader peptide may also be inserted downstream of the signal sequence and upstream of the DNA sequence encoding the human Factor VII polypeptides. The function of tine leader peptide is to allow the expressed peptide to be directed from tine endoplasmic reticulum to theGolgi apparatus and further to a secretory vesicle for secretion Into the culture medium (i.e. exportation of tine human Fador VII polypeptides across the cell wall or at least through the cellular membrane into the periplasmic space of the yeast cell). The leader peptide may be the yeast alpha-fador leader (theuse of which is described in e.g. US 4,546,082, US 4,870.008. EP 16 201. EP 123 294. EP 123 544 and EP 163 529). Alternatively, tine leader peptide may be a synthetic leader peptide, which is to say a leader peptide not found In natijre. Synthetic leader peptides may, for instance, be constructed as described in WO 89/02463 or WO 92/11378.<br>
For use in filamentous fungi, the signal peptide may convenlentiy be derived from a gene encoding an Aspergillus sp. amylase or glucoamylase, a gene encoding a Rh'rzomucor mlehel pase or protease or a Humicola lanuginosa lipase. The signal peptide is preferably derived from a gene encoding 4. oryzae TAKA amylase, A, n/ger neutral a-^mylase, A niger acid-stabie amylase, or A niger glucoamylase. Suitable signal peptides are disclosed in, e.g. EP 238 023 and EP 215 594.<br><br><br><br>

Examples of suitable yeasts cells include cells of Saccharomyces spp. or Schizosac-charomyces spp., in particular strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Saccharomyces kluyven\ Methods for transforming yeast ceils with heterologous DNA and producing heterologous polypeptides there from are described, e.g. in US 4,599,311, US 4.931.373. US 4.870.008. 5,037,743, and US 4,845.075, all of which are hercb/incorporated by reference. Transformed cells are selected by a phenotype d^tenmined by a selectable marker, comrTX)nly daig resistance or the ability to grow in the absence of a particular nutrient, e.g. ieudne. A prefenred vector for use in yeast is the P0T1 vector disclosed in US 4,931,373. The DNA sequences encoding the human Factor VII polypeptides may be preceded by a signal sequence and optionally a leader sequence, e.g. as described above. Further examples of suitable yeast cells are strains of Kluyveromyces, such as K. lactis, Hansenufa, e.g. H. polymorpha, or Pichia, e.g. P. pastoris (cf. Gleeson etal.. J. Gen. Microbiol. 132,1986. pp. 3459-3465; US 4,882;279).<br>
Examples of other fungal cells are cells of filamentous fungi, e.g. Aspergillus spp., Neurospora spp., Fusarium spp. or Trichoderma spp., In particular strains of A oryzae, A. nidulans or A niger. The use of Aspergillus spp, for the expression of proteins is described in, e.g., EP 272 277, EP 238 023. EP184 438 The transfbnnation of F. oxyspomm may. for instance, be canled out as described by Malardier et al., 1989, Gene 78:147-156. The transformation of Trichoderma spp. may be performed for instance as described in EP 244 234.<br>

DNA sequences for use witlnin the present invention will typically encode a pre-pro peptide at the amino-temninus of the Factor VII protein to obtain proper post-translationai processing (e.g. gamma-carboxyiation of glutamic acid residues) and seaetion from the host<br><br>
cell. The pre-pro peptide may be that of Factor VII or another vitamin K-dependent plasma protein, such as factor IX. factor X, prothrombin, protein C or protein S, As will be appred-ated by those skilled in the art, additional modifications can be made in the amino acid sequence of Factor VII where those modifications do not significantly impair the ability of the<br><br>
ing the 5' flanking promoter and non-coding portion of the beta-Iactoglobulin gene. See Whitelaw et ai., Biochem J. 286: 31-39 (1992). Similar fragments oi promoter DNA from other species are also suitable.<br><br>
other regions of the beta-lactoglobulin gene may also be incorporated in constructs,<br>
as may genomic regions of the gene to be expressed. It is generally accepted in the art that<br>
I"<br>
constructs lacking introns, for example, express poorly in comparison with those that contain such DNA sequences (see Brinster et al.. Proa Natl. Acad ScL USA 85:836-840 (1988); Palmiter et al.. Proa Natl. Acad ScL USA 88:478-482 (1991); Whitelaw et al., Transgenic Res. 1:3-13,1991); WO 89/01343; and WO 91/02318, each of which is incorporated herein by reference). In this regard, it is generally prefen-ed, where possible, to use genomic sequences containing all or some of the native introns of a gene encoding the protein or polypeptide of Interest, thus the further inclusion of at least some introns from, e.g, the beta-lactoglobulin gene, is preferred. One such region is a DNA segment which provides for intron splicing and RNA polyadenylation from the 3* non-coding region of the ovine beta-lactoglobulin gene.'When substituted for the natural 3* non-coding sequences of agehe, this ovine beta-lactogiobulin segment can both enhance and stabilize expression levels of the protein or polypeptide of interest. Within other embodiments, the region surrounding the initiation ATG of the sequence encoding the human Factor VII polypeptide is replaced with corresponding sequences from a milk specific protein gene. Such replacement provides a putative tissue-specific initiation environment to enhance expression. It is convenient to replace the entire pre-pro sequence of the human Factor V!l polypeptide and 5' non-coding se-' quences with those of, for example, the BLG gene, although smaller regions may be replaced.<br>
For expression of a human Factor VII polypeptide in transgenic animals, a DNA segment encoding the human Factor VII polypeptide is operabiy linked to additional DNA segments required for its expression to produce expression units. Such additional segments include the above-mentioned promoter, as well as sequences which provide for temiination of transcription and polyadenylation of mRNA, The expression units will further include a DNA segment encoding a secretory signal sequence operabiy linked to the segment encoding the human Factor VII polypeptide. The secretory signal sequence may be a native seae-tory signal sequence of the human Factor VII polypeptide or may be that of another protein, such as a milk protein.

Construction of expression units for use in transgenic animals is conveniently carried out by inserting a sequence encoding the human Factor Vll polypeptide into a plasmid or phage vector containing the additional DNA segments, although the expression unit may be constructed by essentially any sequence of ligations. It is particularly convenient to provide a vector containing a DNA segment encoding a milk protein and to replace the coding sequence for the milk protein with that of the human Factor Vll polypeptide, thereby creating a<br><br>
gene fusion that includes the expression control sequences of the milk protein gene. In any event, cloning of the expression units in plasmids or other vectors facilitates the amplification of the human Factor VII polypeptide. Amplification is conveniently carried out in bacterial (e.g. E. coll) host cells, thus the vectors will typically include an origin of replication and a selectable marker functional in bacterial host cells.<br>
The expression unit is then introduced into fertilized eggs (including early-stage embryos) of the chosen host species. Introduction of heterologous DNA can be accomplished by one of several routes, including microinjection (e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4.873,191). retroviral infection (Jaenisch, Science 240:1468-1474 (1988)) or site-directed integration using embryonic stem (ES) cells (reviewed by Bradley et al., Bio/Technology "[Q: 534-539 (1992)). The eggs are then implanted into the oviducts or uteri of pseudopregnant females and allowed to develop. Offspring carrying the introduced DNA in their g*enm line can pass the DNA on to their progeny in the normal. Mendellan fashion, allowing the development of transgenic herds.<br>
General procedures for producing transgenic animals QT^ known in the art. See. for example. Hogan et al., Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, 1986; Simons et al., Bio/Technology 6:179-183 (1988); Wall etal.. Biol.

Techniques for introducing foreign DNA sequences into mammals and their germ cells were originally developed In the mouse. See, e.g., Gordon et al.. Proa Natl. Acad. Sci. USA T7: 7380-7384 (1980); Gordon and Ruddle. Science 214:1244-1246 (1981); Palmiter and Brinster. Ce//41: 343-345 (1985); and Brinster et al.. Proc. Natl, Acad, ScL USA 82: 4438-4442 (1985). These techniques were subsequently adapted for use with larger animals, including livestock species (see e.g., WiPO publications WO 88/00239, WO 90/05188. and WO 92/11757; and Simons et al.. BioH'echnology 6:179-183 (1988). To summarize, in the most efficient route used to date in the generation of transgenic mice or livestock, several hundred linear molecules of the DNA of interest are injected irito one of the pro-nuclei of a fertilized egg according to established techniques. Injection of DNA into the cytoplasm of a zygote can also be employed. Production in transgenic plants may also be employed. Expression may be generalized or directed to a particular organ, such as a tuber. See. Hiatt. Nature 344:469-479 (1990); Edelbaum et al.. J. Interferon Res. 12:449-453 (1992); Sijmons et al..

A systemic activation of the coagulation cascade may lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIG). However, such complications have not been seen in subjects treated with high doses of recombinant Factor Vila because of a localised haemostatic process of the kind induced by the complex formation between Factor Vila and TF exposed at the site of vessel wall injury. The procoagulant Factor VII derivatives<br><br>
according to the invention may thus also be used in their activated form to control such excessive bleedings associated with a normal haemostatic mechanism.<br>
For treatment in connection with deliberate interventions, the procoagulant Factor VII derivatives of the invention will typically be administered within about 24 hours prior to performing the inten/ention, and for as much as 7 days or more thereafter. Administration as a coagulant can be by a variety of routes as described herein.<br>
The dose of the Factor VII derivatives ranges from about 0.05 mg to 500 mg/day, preferably from about 1 mg to 200 mg/day, and more preferably from about 10 mg to about 175 mg/day for a 70 kg subject as loading and maintenance doses, depending on the sevenfy of the condition.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions are primarily intended for parenteral administration for prophylactic and/or ti^erapeutic treatment. Preferably, the phannaceuti'cal compositions are administered parenterally. i.e.. intravenously, subcutaneously. or intramusculariy, or it may be administered by continuous or pulsatile infusion. The compositi'ons for parenteral administration comprise the Factor VII derivative of the invention In combination with, preferably dissolved In, a pharmaceuti'cally acceptable cam'er. preferably an aqueous carrier. A variety of aqueous caniers may be used, such as water, buffered water. 0,4% saline, 0.3% glydne and the like. The Factor Vfl derivatives of the invention can also be formulated into liposome preparations for delivery or targeting to the sites of injury. Liposome preparations are generally described In. e.g., U.S. 4.837.028, U.S. 4,501.728, and U.S. 4.975,282. The compositions may be sterilised by conventional, well-known sterilisation techniques. The resulting aqueous solutions may be packaged for use or filtered under aseptic conditions and lyophilised, tine lyophillsed preparation being combined with a sterile aqueous solution prior to administi^tion. The compositions may contain pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliary substances as required td approximate physiological conditions, such as pH adjusting and buffering agents, tonicity adjusting agents and the like, for example, sodium acetate, sodium lactate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, etc.<br>
The concentration of Factor VII derivative in these formulations can vary widely, i.e., from less than about 0.5% by weight, usually at or at least about 1% by weight to as much as 15 or 20% by weight and will be selected primarily by flukl volumes, viscosities, etc, in accordance with the particular mode of administration selected.<br>
Thus, a typical pharmaceutical composition for intravenous infusion could be made up to contain 250 mi of sterile Ringer's solution and 10 mg of the Factor VII polypeptide. Actual methods for preparing parenterally administrable compositions will be known or apparent to those skilled in the art and are described in more detail in, for example.<br><br>
Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th ed., Mack Publishing Company, Easton. PA (1990).<br>
The compositions containing the Factor VII derivatives of the present invention can be administered for prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatments. In therapeutic applications, compositions are administered to a subject already suffering from a disease, as described above, in an amount sufficient to cure, alleviate or partially arrest the disease and its complications. An amount adequate to accomplish this is defined as "^erapeutically effective amounr. As will be understood by the person skilled in the art amounts effective for this purpose will depend on the severity of the disease or injury as well as the weight and general state of the subject In general, however, the effective amount will range from about 0.05 mg up to about 500 mg of the Factor VII derivative per day for a 70 kg subject, with dosages of from about 1.0 mg to about 200 mg of the Factor VII derivative p^r day being more commonly used.    <br>
It must be kept in mind that the materials of the present invention may generally be employed in serious disease or injury states, that is, life threatening or potentially life threatening situations, in such cases, in view of the minimisation of extraneous substances and general lack of immunogenicity of human Factor Vll derivatives in humans, it is possible and may be felt desirable by the treating physician to administer a substantial excess of these variant Factor Vil compositions.<br>
In prophylactic applications, compositions containing the Factor Vll derivative of the invention are administered to a subject susceptible to or otherwise at risk of a disease state or injury to enhance the subject's own coagulative capability. Such an amount is defined to be a "prophylactically effective dose." In prophylactic applications, theprecise amounts once again depend on tine subject's state of health and weight, but the dose generally ranges from about 0-05 mg to about 500 mg per day for a 70-kilogram subject, more commonly from about 1-0 mg to about 200 mg per day for a 70-kilogram subject.<br>
Single or multiple administrations of the compositions can be carried out with dose levels and patterns being selected by the treating physician. For ambulatory subjects requiring daily maintenance levels, the Factor Vll derivatives may be administered by continuous infusion using e.g. a portable pump system.<br>
Local delivery of the Factor Vll derivative of the present invention, such as, for example, topical application may be earned out, for example, by means of a spray, perfusion, double balloon catheters, stent incorporated into vascular grafts or stents, hydrogels used to coat balloon catheters, or other well established methods. In any event, the phannaceutical compositions should provide a quantity of Factor Vll derivative sufficient to effectively ti-eat the subject.<br><br>
Inactivated Factor Yll polypeptides of the present invention is able to bind to cell-surface tissue factor. For exampjp. DEGR-Fador Vila binds cell-surface tissue factor with an equivalent or higfier affinity than wild-type Factor Vila. DEGR-Factor Vila, however, has no enzymatic activity, yet it binds to tissue factor and acts as a competitive antagonist for wild-type Factor Vila, thereby inhibiting the subsequent steps in the extrinsic pathway of coagulation leading to the generation of thrombin.<br><br>
The inactivated Factor VII derivatives may be particulariy useful In the treatment of intimal hyperplasia, restenosis due to acute vascular injury, deep venous thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, post surgical thrombosis, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). percutaneous transdermal coronary angioplastry (PICA), strolce, cancer, tumour metastasis, angiogenesis, ischemia/reperfusion, riieumatoid arthritis, thrombolysis, arteriosclerosis and restenosis following angioplastry, acute and chronic indications such as inflammation, septic chock, septicemia, hypotension, adult respiratory distress syndrome (AROS), disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIG), pulmonary embolism, platelet deposition, myocardial infarction, or the prophylactic treatment of mammals with atherosclerotic vessels at risk for thrombosis. Acute vascular injuries are those which occur rapidly (i.e. over days to months), in contrast to chronic vascular injuries (e.g. atherosclerosis) which develop over a lifetime. Acute vascular injuries often result from surgical procedures such as vascular reconstruction, wherein the techniques of angioplasty, endarterectomy, atherectomy, vascular graft emplacement or the like are employed. Hyperplasia may also occur as a delayed response in response to, e.g., graft emplacement or organ transplantation. Since inactivated Factor VII derivatives is more selective than heparin, generally binding only tissue factor which has been exposed at sites of injury, and because inactivated Factor VII derivatives does not destroy other coagulation proteins, it will be more effective and less likely to cause bleeding complications than heparin when used prophylactically for the prevention of deep vein thrombosis.<br><br>
Inactivated Factor VII derivatives which maintain tissue factor binding inhibit platelet accumulation at the site of vascular injury by blocking tfie production of thrombin and the subsequent deposition of fibrin.<br>
Due to the ability of DEGR-Factor VII to block thrombin generation and limit platelet deposition at sites of acute vascular injury, inactivated Factor VII derivatives which maintain tissue factor binding activity but lack Factor VIIa enzymatic activity can be used to inhibit vascular restenosis.<br>
Compositions comprising inactivated Factor VII derivatives are particularly useful in methods for treating patients when formu/ated into phamiaceutical compositions, where they may be given to individuals suffering from a variety of disease states to treat coagulation-related conditions. Such inactivated Factor VII derivatives, capable of binding tissue factor but hflVjng a substgritially reduced ability to catalyze activation of other factors in the clotting cascade, may possess a longer plasma half-life and thus a conrespondingly longer period of anticoagulative activity when compared to other anticoagulants. Among the medical Indications for the subject compositions are those commonly treated with anticoagulants, such as, for example, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, stroke, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), fibrin deposition in lungs and kidneys associated with gram-negative en-dotoxemia, and myocardial infarction. The compositions can be used to inhibit vascular restenosis as occurs following mechanical vascular injury, such as injury caused by balloon angioplasty, endarterectomy, reductive atherectomy, stent placement, laser therapy or rotab-lation. or as occurs secondary to vascular grafts, stents, bypass grafts or organ transplants. The compositions can thus be used to inhibit platelet deposition and associated disorders. Thus, a method of inhibiting coagulation, vascular restenosis or platelet deposition, for example, comprises administering to a patient a composition comprising inactivated Factor VII derivatives, such as that having at least one amino acid substitution In a catalytic thad of Ser344, Asp242 and His193. in an amount sufficient to effectively inhibit coagulation, vascular restenosis or platelet deposition. The methods also find use in the treatment of acute closure of a coronary artery in an individual (e.g. acute myocardial infarction), which comprises administering the inactivated Factor VII derivatives, which includes DEGR-Factor V(l and FFR-Factor VII, in conjunction with tissue plasminogen activator or streptokinase, and can accelerate tPA induced thrombolysis. The inactivated Factor VII derivatives is given prior to, in conjunction with, or shortly following administration of a thrombolytic agent, such as tissue plasminogen activator.<br>
Compositions of inactivated'Factor VII derivatives will also have substantial utility in the prevention of cardiogenic emboli and in the treatment of thrombotic strokes. Because of its low potential for causing bleeding complications and its selectivity, Factor VII derivatives<br><br><br>
/<br><br>
Composit'ons comprising inactivated Factor VII derivatives will typically be administered within about 24 hours prior to performing an intervention, and for as much as 7 days or more thereafter. Administration can be by a variety of routes as further described herein. The compositions comprising inactivated Factor VII derivatives can also be administered sys-temlcally or locally for the placement of vascular grafts (e.g., by coating synthetic or modified natural arterial vascular grafts), at sites of anastomosis, surgical endarterectomy (typically carotid artery endarterectomy), bypass grafts, and the lilce.<br>
In the treatment of established deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism, the dose of Factor VII derivatives ranges from about 50 pg to 500 mg/day, more typically 1 mg to 200 mg/day, and more preferably 10 mg to about 175 mg/day for a 70 l<g patient as loading and maintenance doses depending on the weight of severity condition..because lower like hood bleeding complfcatlons from infusions inactivated factor vii derivatives can replace or dose heparin during after surgery in conjunction with thrombectomies embolecto-mies.></g>
In cases of acute bacteremia, endotoxemia or DIG, the patient is given a loading dose of a Factor VII derivative of at least about 50 ^g to 500 mg/day. more typically 1 mg to 200 mg/day. and more preferably 10 mg to about 175 mg/day for a 70 kg patient, with maintenance doses thereafter in (he range of 50 ^g to 500 mg/day, typically 1 mg to 200 mg/day for a 70 kg patient.<br>
Preferably, the Factor VII derivative has a half-life (Ua) which is enhanced relative to the half-life of the unconjugated Factor VII from which It was derived. Preferably, the half-life of the Factor VII derivative is enhanced by at least 1.5-fold to 2-fold, more preferably by about 2'foldi to 3-fold, even more preferably by about 5-fold to 10-fold, optimally about 100-fold, usually about 5-fold relative to the half-life of the unmodified parent Factor VII.<br>
