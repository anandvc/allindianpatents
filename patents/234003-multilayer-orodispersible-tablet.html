				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a multilayer orodispersible tablet and to the proeess<br>
for preparing it.<br>
The term "orodispcrsihle tablet" means a tablet intended to be disintegrated or<br>
dissolved in the mouth, without chewing, on contact with saliva, in less than 60<br>
seconds and preferably less than 40 seconds, forming a particle suspension that is easy<br>
to swallow.<br>
The disintegration time corresponds to the lime between the moment when the tablet<br>
is placed on the tongue and the moment that the suspension resulting from the<br>
disintegration or dissolution of the tablet is swallowed.<br>
This type of tablet is described, for example, in documents EP 548 356. EP 636 364.<br>
EP 1003 484. EP 1058 538, WO 98/46215. WO 0006126. WO 00/27357 and<br>
WO 00/51568.<br>
Once swallowed, the particles of active substance release the active substance into the<br>
lower part of the gastrointestinal tract.<br>
Owing to its ease of use. the orodispersible tablet is entirely suitable for ambulators<br>
treatment, more parlicularly for certain patients and espccially the elderly or voting<br>
children, who have difficulties in swallowing such that they find it unpleasant, or oven<br>
impossible, to ingest tablets or gel capsules, even with a simultaneous intake of liquid.<br>
It is estimated that 50% of (he population experiences such difficulties, with the<br>
possible consequence of the prescribed medicinal product not being taken and thus a<br>
major impact on the efficacy of the treatment (II. Seager. 1908. J. Pharm. Pharmacol.<br>
50. 375-382).<br>
These difficulties in swallowing are obviously exacerbated when several medicinal<br>
products need to be taken throughout the day. thus multiplying the number of intakes.<br>
Orodispersible tablets comprising fixed combinations of active substances would<br>
represent a solution for improving the patient compliance with long-term treatments,<br>
in the case of chronic pathologies especially affecting the elderly or children.<br>
Attempts to produce such tablets have already been made, for example by tableting a<br>
single mixture comprising both tableting excipienls and active substances. However,<br>
these tablets have certain drawbacks, especially non-uniformity of the contents of<br>
each of the active substances, or a risk of incompatibility between the various<br>
components of the tablet, active substances or excipients.<br>
Specifically, a first technical difficulty is that of obtaining uniformity of the contents<br>
of each active substance, throughout the forming process, in this instance the tableting<br>
of the powder mixture comprising all the components of the said tablet.<br>
Powder mixtures are generally complex to control since they consist of several<br>
populations of active substances and excipienls. each having its own size. density or<br><br>
shape characteristics.<br>
This non-uniformity gives rise to an increased risk of segregation, which is refleeled<br>
bv gradual demixing of certain populations of particles, during storage or in the feed<br><br>
hopper of the tableting machine.<br>
The final unit form then has a highly variable content of each of the active substances,<br>
and intrinsic hardness, disintegration or palatabilily characteristics that are<br>
significantly different within the same batch.<br>
Meticulous selection of the populations of active substances and excipients is not<br>
sufficient to entirely eliminate this risk.<br>
Moreover, other solutions, applicable to orodispersible tablets, have been proposed to<br>
improve the content uniformity, for example by the Applicant in patent application<br>
FR 03 01308 (as yet unpublished), but these are not entirely satisfactory for limiting<br>
The risks of incompalibilily.<br>
Specifically a second technical difficulty in producing tablets comprising a<br>
combination of active substances is the choice of active substances and excipienls that<br>
may be used together, on account of a risk of incompatibility between the active<br>
substances themselves or between an active substance and excipienls. this risk<br>
increasing when the number of components present in the tablet is larger.<br>
In order to reduce these risks of incompatibility, solutions have been proposed,<br>
especially via the preparation of multilayer tablets. Such tablets have been described<br>
for many years (Abrege de Pharmacie Galcnique [Abstract of Pharmaceutical<br>
Pharmacy]. Le Hir. 3rd ed., p. 269. Evaluation of bilayer tablet machines - A case<br>
study. S.P. Li. M.G. Karth. K.M. Feld. L.C. Di Paolo. C.M. Pendharkar. R.O.<br>
Williams. Drug Dev. Ind. Pharm.. 21 (5). 571 - 590 (1995)).<br>
They are formed from at least two layers that adhere together via a surface.<br>
Each layer of the tablet has its own composition, and is successively formed by a<br>
cycle of lableling. which limits both the risks of non-uniformity of content and of<br>
physicochemical incompatibility.<br>
However, this type of tablet requires formulation adjustments to ensure cohesion of<br>
the various layers.<br>
This aim is usually achieved by applying high compression forces, resulting in tablets<br>
with hardness values that are often much higher than 100N. or by the presence of a<br>
binder in at least one of the layers of the tablet, in an amount that is effective for<br>
promoling adhesion between the layers.<br>
Furthermore, the preparation of a multilayer tablet makes it necessary to repeat the<br>
application of compression forces on each powder mixture.<br>
Those conditions we therefore not favourable, either in the ease of tablets intended to<br>
be disintegrated rapidly, or in the case of active substances requiring masking of their<br>
bitterness. via means such as polymer coating, that are known to be particularly<br>
sensitive to compression, and the use of which is incompatible with the application ol'<br>
high compression forces, which increases the risk of breaking the film.<br>
This is why. at the present time, among the solid forms intended to be disintegrated in<br>
the mouth, the only multilayer tablets that exist are in the form of tablets or pastilles<br>
for sucking, for the administration of active substances with local action, limited to<br>
the buccal mucosae and the oropharynx and that do not require any taste masking<br>
other than the simple addition of sweeteners.<br>
One known example of such tablets for sublingual administration is Solutricine®<br>
vitamin C sold in France by Theraplix. which is a three-layer tablet comprising<br>
lyrothrycin and ascorbic acid.<br>
These multilayer tablets for sucking have a high level of hardness to ensure adhesion<br>
of the layers, and have a residence lime in the oral cavity of several minutes,<br>
corresponding to the time during which the tablet gradually disintegrates.<br>
The erosion and solubilization, the main mechanisms of disintegration of such tablet,<br>
then directly depend on the size of the tablet and its surface area in contact with the<br>
saliva.<br>
As a result of the constraints they impose, the solutions proposed to date for<br>
formulating combinations of active substances therefore cannot be applied to<br>
orodispersible tablets, and even less so when the taste of the active substances used<br>
needs to be masked.<br>
There is thus a real need for orodispersible tablets that allow the combination of<br>
various active substances, which arc optionally coated, without having the drawbacks<br>
of non-uniformity of content or of incompatibility.<br>
The Applicant has found, against all expectations, that it is possible to obtain a<br>
multilayer orodispersible tablet.<br>
Thus, the present invention relates to a tablet that is orodispersible and that consists of<br>
at least two superimposed and integral layers, the said two layers each comprising at<br>
least one active substance.<br>
Each of the layers comprises a mixture of tableting excipients. The mixture of<br>
excipients comprises:<br>
- at least one soluble agent and<br>
- at least one disintegrant and/or at least one swelling agent.<br>
The number of layers is limited by the resulting thickness of the tablet, which must be<br>
acceptable to the patient, and generally does not exceed three.<br>
In a first variant of the invention, the orodispersible tablet is a bi-layer tablet<br>
comprising at least one active substance in each layer.<br>
In a second variant of the invention, the orodispersible tablet is a three-layer tablet.<br>
In this case, the three layers may contain an active substance or one of the layers may<br>
contain only excipients.<br>
Advantageously, the layer containing only excipients is inserted between the two<br>
layers each comprising at least one active substance.<br>
According to one variant of the invention, the active substance of two of the layers is<br>
the same base molecule, but differs by the nature of the salt or of the base used, or else<br>
by its polymorphic or amorphous crystalline stale, the solubility and/or the pharmaco-<br>
kinetic characteristics of the molecule present in one of the layers being different from<br>
those of the molecule present in another layer.<br>
According to another variant of the invention, the active substance present in each of<br>
the layers is chemically identical, but is formed differently in each of the layers, so as<br>
to have significantly different in vitro and in vivo release rates.<br>
The active substance is. for example, in the form of particles with modified release<br>
properties, for example sustained-release properties, so as to effectively release over a<br>
period of between 8 and 24 hours, or delayed-release properties allowing the active<br>
substance to be released onto a specific site of absorption or to avoid its degradation<br>
in a medium of unfavourable pH.<br>
In this variant, the active substance of the other layer is in an immediate form,<br>
optionally coated if the molecule requires simple taste masking, or modified<br>
according to a release profile that is different from that of the first layer.<br>
These release or taste-masking characteristics max be achieved by any known method<br>
for achieving this result, but preferably by means of a polymer coating around the<br>
active substance particle.<br>
The plasmatic profile resulting from the administration of such a tablet to a patient<br>
shows several plasmatic concentration peaks, corresponding to the different release<br>
rales of the particles of each laver. the said particles having been swallowed<br>
simultaneously, after disintegration of the oroclispersible tablet.<br>
The active substance(s) may be chosen from any family of drugs, for example from<br>
gastrointestinal sedatives, antacids, analgesics, antinflammatories. coronary<br>
vasodilators, peripheral and cerebral vasodilators, antiinfeetives. antibiotics, antiviral<br>
agents, antiparasitic agents, anticancer agents, anxiolytics, neuroleptics, central<br>
nervous system stimulants, antidepressants, antihistamines, antidiarrheal agents,<br>
laxatives, dietary supplements, immunodepressants. hypocholeslerolacmianls.<br>
hormones, enzymes, antispasmodics, antianginal agents, medicinal products that<br>
affect the heart rale, medicinal products used in the treatment of arterial hypertension,<br>
antimigraine agents, medicinal products that affect blood clotting, antiepileptics.<br>
muscle relaxants, medicinal producls used in the treatment of diabetes, medicinal<br>
products used in the treatment of thyroid dysfunctions, diuretics, anorexigenic agents,<br>
antiasthmatics, expectorants, antitussive agents, mucoregulators. decongestants,<br>
hypnotics, antinausea agents, hematopoietic agents, uricosuric agents, plant extracts,<br>
contrast agents or any other family of compounds, the active substances combined in<br>
the tablet possibly being chosen from the same family or from different families.<br>
The active substances may be in the form of the pharmaceutically acceptable salts<br>
thereof or any polymorphic form (racemic mixture, enantiomer. etc.). The expression<br>
'pharmaceutically acceptable salts" means the derivatives of the described<br>
compounds in which the base pharmaceutically active compound is converted into its<br>
basic or acidic salt, examples of pharmaceutically active salts especially comprise the<br>
organic acid or mineral acid salts of basic residues such as amines: the alkaline<br>
derivatives or the organic salts of acidic residues such as carboxylic acids, and the<br>
like. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts comprise the standard non-toxic salts or<br>
the quaternary ammonium salts of the base compound, formed, for example, from<br>
non-toxic mineral or organic acids. For example, such standard non-toxic salts<br>
comprise those derived from mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic<br>
acid, sulphuric acid, sulphonic acid, sulphamic acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid and<br>
the like: and the salts prepared from organic acids such as amino acids, acetic acid,<br>
propionic acid, succinic acid, glycolic acid, stearic acid, lactic acid, malic acid, tartaric<br>
acid, citric acid, ascorbic acid, pamoic acid, maleic acid, hydroxymaleic acid,<br>
phenylacelic acid, glutamic acid, benzoic acid, salicylic acid, sulphanilic acid. 2-<br>
acetoxybenzoic acid, fumaric acid, loluenesulphonic acid, melhanesulphonic acid,<br>
elhancdisulphonic acid, oxalic acid, iselhionic acid, and die like.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable sails of the present invention may be synthesized<br>
from the base therapeutic compound which contains an acidic or basic fraction, via<br>
standard processes. In general, these salts may be prepared by reacting the free acid or<br>
free base forms with a predetermined amount of the appropriate base or acid in water<br>
or in an organic solvent or in a mixture of water and organic solvent.<br>
Non-aqueous media are generally preferred. The lists of suitable salts are given in<br>
Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences. 17th ed.. Mack Publishing Company, Easton.<br>
PA.1985. p. 1418.<br>
The expression "pharmaceulically acceptable" is used herein to refer to compounds,<br>
materials, compositions and/or pharmaceutical forms that are. according to what is<br>
commonlv medicallv accepted, suitable for use on contact with human or animal<br>
tissues without toxicity, irritation, allergic response or other excessive problem or<br>
complication, for a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.<br>
The multilayer orodispersible tablet according to the invention is particularly suitable<br>
for administering medicinal products in combination since it makes it possible both to<br>
reduce the number of units to be taken each day by the patient and to improve the<br>
patient compliance with the treatments in the case of individuals who have difficulty<br>
in swallowing.<br>
The combinations are particularly studied by the pharmaceutical laboratories: those<br>
mentioned below are given as non-limiting examples.<br>
The combinations of active substances are particularly useful in the field of analgesia,<br>
when a synergistic effect is desired, for example by combining morphine, oxycodone,<br>
hydrocodone or tramadol with a second analgesic such as ibuprofen or paracetamol,<br>
or in the antiinllammalory field, by combining keloprofen and naproxen, or diclofenac<br>
with misoprostol.<br>
It is also possible to jointly administer an opioid analgesic, for example oxieodone or<br>
morphine, with an opioid-receptor antagonist such as naloxone or naltrexone, to avoid<br>
the abusive use of the medicinal product by drug addicts.<br>
In the antiulcer field, the preferred combinations combine antiulcer agents, for<br>
example a proton pump inhibitor such as omeprazole or lansoprazole, an 11-2 receptor<br>
inhibitor such as famotidine or ranitidine, or an antacid.<br>
In the field of hypocholeslerolaemiants and antidiabetics, it is possible to combine<br>
molecules belonging to different families, these including fibrates. for example<br>
fenolibrate. biguanides. such as metformin, or statins, such as alorvastatin or<br>
simvastatin.<br>
Other fields are particularly studied, such as those of medicinal products that are<br>
effective against the AIDS virus or anticancer agents.<br>
The active substance, the size of which may be between 20 um and 1,000 µm may be<br>
in the form of powder or microcrystals. or in the form of granules obtained by dry. wet<br>
or hot granulation, or alternatively in the form of granules obtained by mounting on<br>

weight relative to the weight of the uncoaled particles.<br>
Where appropriate, the powder, the microcryslals or the active substance particles<br>
may be advantageously coaled with a functional layer whose composition is chosen as<br>
a function of the desired characteristics, especially taste masking and/or modilled.<br>

form a continuous film that covers the entire surface of each particle, irrespective of<br>
the state of the surface, in an amount that is sufficient to make it possible, for<br>
example, to obtain efficient taste masking at the moment thai the medicinal product is<br>
taken and throughout the residence lime of the coated particles in (he oral cavily.<br>
The thickness of the film, which is generally between 5 µm and 75 µm. usually<br>
depends on the solubility of the active substance at the pH of the saliva and on the<br>
more or less pronounced nature of its bitterness.<br>
The polymer is applied to the surface of the active substance particles in proportions<br>
that may be up to 60% and preferably up to 20%. calculated as added weight relative<br>
to the weight of coaled particles.<br>

excipients. in a second variant, a fraction of this lubricant is sprayed onto the walls of<br>
the die and the punches at the time of compression, said lubricant fraction then being<br>
in the form of a powder or a liquid.<br>
The amounts of lubricant used in the internal and'or external phase are carefully<br>
adjusted so as to prevent an excess from adversely affecting the cohesion of the layers<br>
at the time of the final compression.<br>

of each active substance.<br>
The maximum mass ratio tolerated between the thickest layer and the thinnest layer is<br>
10/1.<br>
In the case where the dose ratio between the most heavily dosed active substance and<br>
the most lightly dosed active substance is greater than 10. the amount of diluent is<br>
adjusted such that the weight ratio between the layers is brought back to a value of 10.<br>
In this case, the diluent is preferably a soluble agent, more preferably a soluble agent<br>

The tablets generally have a mass of between 0.1 gram and 2.0 grams.<br>
The invention also relates to the process tor preparing the multilayer tablets described<br>
above.<br>
The process in accordance with the invention comprises the following slops:<br>
1. preparation of at least two types of particles of optionally coated active<br>
substances:<br>
2. preparation of at least two dry mixtures each comprising tableling excipients<br>
and at least one type of particles of active substance:<br>
3. preeompression of at least one of the powder mixtures obtained above;<br>
4. application of another mixture to the abo\e mixture :<br>
5. optional preeompression:<br>
6. final compression on the preformed layers obtained above.<br>
steps 4 and 5 possibly being repeated at least once depending on the number of layers<br>
of the tablet.<br>
In the case of a bi-layer tablet, the process in accordance with the invention comprises<br>
the following steps:<br>
preparation of two types of optionally coated particles of active substance:<br>
preparation of two dry mixtures each comprising the tableling excipients and<br>
the active substance particles prepared above.<br>
preeompression of one of the above mixtures so as to preform the lower laver<br>
of the tablet.<br>
application of the second mixture to the preformed laver:<br>
optionally, preeompression of the second mixture so as to preform the upper<br>
layer of the tablet.<br>
final compression.<br>
In the case of a tri-layer tablet, the process in accordance with the invention comprises<br>
the following steps:<br>
preparation of at least two types of optionally coaled particles of active<br>
substance:<br>
preparation of three dry mixtures each comprising the tableling excipients and<br>
at least two of which also comprise the active substance particles prepared<br>
above.<br>
precompivssion of one of the aioxne nii.\Uire so as to prelbrni ilie lower layer<br>
of ihe lablet.<br>
application of a second mixture to the preformed layer.<br>
precompression of the second mixture so as to preform the intermediate layer<br>
of the tablet.<br>
application of the third mixture to the preformed la\er:<br>
optionally, precompression of the third mixture so as to preform the upper<br>
layer of the tablet,<br>
final compression.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the preparation ol each mixture itself comprises two<br>
steps, the lust step consisting in mixing the coated or uncoat'ed active substance with<br>
i<br>
all of the (abiding excipients except for (he internal lubricant, followed by a second<br>
step in which the lubricant is totally or partially added to the lust mix. ihe remaining<br>
portion then being sprayed onto the punches and/or onto the inner face of the dies.<br>
When all of the lubricant is sprayed onto the punches and/or onto the inner face of the<br>
dies.jthe second mixing step is then obviously omitted.<br>
The precompression and compression steps are performed on an alternating or rotary<br>
(abiding machine.<br>
The precompression is intended on the one hand to preform the layer by packing the<br>
bed of powder in the die. and secondly to remove yas from the said bed of powder, by<br>
reorganizant the particles, so as to avoid the appearance of clcavaue at the time of the<br>
final compression, this cleavage possibly arising either between the layers, due to lack<br>
of adhesion, or within the layer itself.<br>
In a tablet whose layers do not have the same relative mass and/or thickness<br>
magnitude, the first preformed layer is the one of larger mass or thickness.<br>
The stresses exerted during the prccompression step may range from 0.5 to 15 kN and<br>
are generally 5 to 10 times lower than the stresses exerted during the final<br>
compression.<br>
The stresses exerted during the compression step may range from 5 KN to 50 kN and<br>
preferably from 5 kN to 15 kN.<br>
The precompression forces applied to the beds of powder are adjusted according to<br>
two possible modes, the first consisting in adjusting the compression force as a<br>
function of the variations measured by the machine regarding the heights of the bed of<br>
powder in the die. and the second consists in adjusting the filling volume as a function<br>
of the measured pressure exerted by the punches.<br>
The hardness of these tablets is preferably between I and 10 kp and more preferably<br>
between I and 6 kp. measured according to the method of the European<br>
Pharmacopoeia (2.9.8). I kp being equal to 9.8 N.<br>
The hardness of the multilayer tablet is adapted so as to obtain a friability measured<br><br>
according to the method of the European Pharmacopoeia., of less than 2% and<br>
preferably less than 1%. and so as to allow a disintegration time of the tablet in the<br><br><br>
mouth under the action of saliva of less than or equal to 60 seconds and preferably<br><br><br>
less than or equal to 40 seconds.<br>
In the case where the tablet of the invention contains an active substance in coated<br><br>
form whether to mask its taste or to delay or sustain its release, the compression must<br>
be performed so as to maintain an identical dissolution profile between the coated<br>
active substance particles before and alter compression, the term "identical"<br>
necessarily meaning not differing by more than 15% as an absolute value relative to<br>
the percentage of active substance released at each sampling time under the same in<br>
vitro dissolution conditions.<br>
The invention will be understood more clearly by means of the examples of<br>
preparation of the tablets in accordance to the invention. These examples are given<br>
purely lor the purpose of illustrating advantageous embodiments of the invention, and<br>
do not in any way constitute a limitation thereof.<br>
