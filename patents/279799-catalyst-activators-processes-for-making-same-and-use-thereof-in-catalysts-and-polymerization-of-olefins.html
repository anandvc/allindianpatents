				<td>CATALYST ACTIVATORS, PROCESSES FOR MAKING SAME, AND USE THEREOF IN CATALYSTS AND POLYMERIZATION OF OLEFINS<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0001]    Partially hydrolyzed aluminum alkyl compounds known as aluminoxanes (AO) are used for activating transition metals for olefin polymerization activity. One such compound, methylaluminoxane (MAO), is a frequently chosen aluminum co-catalyst/activator in the industry. Considerable effort has been devoted to improving the effectiveness of catalyst systems based on use of aluminoxanes, hydroxyaluminoxanes, or modified aluminoxanes for polymerization of olefins. Representative patents and publications in the field of aluminoxane usage include the following: U.S. Patent No. 5,324,800 to Welborn et al.; U.S. Patent No. 4,752,597 to Turner; U.S. Patent Nos. 4,960,878 and 5,041,584 to Crapo et al.; WO 96102580 to Dall'occo, et al.; EP 0 277 003 and EP 0 277 004 to Turner; Hlatky, Turner, and Eckman, J. Am. Chem. Soc, 1989, 111, 2728-2729; Hlatky and Upton, Macromolecules, 1996, 29, 8019-8020. U.S. Patent No. 5,153,157 to Hlatky and Turner; U.S. Patent No. 5,198,401 to Turner, Hlatky, and Eckman; Brintzinger, et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl., 1995, 34, 1143-1170; and the like. Hydroxyaluminoxane compositions are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,562,991, 6,555,494, 6,492,292, 6,462,212, and 6,160,145.   Despite technological advances, many aluminoxane-based polymerization catalyst activators still lack the activity and/or thermal stability needed for commercial applicability, require commercially unacceptably high aluminum loading, are expensive (especially MAO), and have other impediments to commercial implementation.<br>
[0002]    U.S. Patent No. 5,384,299 describes zwitterionic catalyst systems prepared by protolysis from dialkyl-metallocenes and borate anions. WO 91/09882 describes supported cationic metallocene catalysts based on the above-mentioned borate anion, wherein the catalyst system is formed by application of a dialkyl-metallocene compound and a Bronsted-acid, quaternary ammonium compound having a non coordinating anion, tetrakispentafluoroborate, to an inorganic support. The support is modified beforehand by means of a trialkylaluminum compound. One disadvantage of this method of application to a support is that only a small part of the metallocene used is immobilized by physisorbtion on the support material; and, thus, the metallocene is prone to detach from the support surface, which can ultimately lead to reactor fouling.<br>
f0003]   WO 96/04319 describes a catalyst system in which the borate activator anion is covalently bound to the support material directly through one oxygen atom of the metal oxide support. However, such a catalyst system has a low polymerization activity by commercial standards. Another disadvantage of such a catalyst system is described by Basset et al. (J.Am. Chem. Soc, 128(2006)9361). Basset et al. describe catalyst deactivation pathways for such covalently bound (through one oxygen atom of the metal oxide, silica, support) borate activator anions as well as a deactivation pathway involving the reaction of the four member siloxane rings of the silica support (formed by calcination of the silica up to and greater than 600°C). Deactivation pathways described in publications show the limitations of borate activator anions covalently bound to one oxygen atom of the metal oxide carrier and additionally, the importance of controlling the structures within the metal oxide carrier as a result of calcination. [0004]    Thus, there is a need for activator compositions that are stable to deactivation pathways and that exhibit high sustainable activity for commercial olefin polymerizations.<br>
THE INVENTION<br>
[0005]   This invention meets the above-described needs by providing compositions derived from at least: a) compound derived from at least (i) carrier having at least one pair of hydrogen bonded hydroxyl groups; (ii) organoaluminum compound; and (iii) Lewis base, such that each of a majority of aiuminum atoms in the organoaluminum compound forms chemical bonds with at least two oxygen atoms from the at least one pair of hydrogen bonded hydroxyl groups; and b) Bronsted acid, wherein the molar ratio of the Bronsted acid to the organoaluminum compound is less than or equal to about 2:1. This invention also provides methods of preparing compositions comprising combining at least: a) compound derived from at least (i) carrier having at least one pair of hydrogen bonded hydroxyl groups; (ii) organoaluminum compound; and (iii) Lewis base, such that each of a majority of aluminum atoms in the organoaluminum compound forms chemical bonds with at least two oxygen atoms from the at least one pair of hydrogen bonded hydroxyl groups; and b) Bronsted acid, wherein the molar ratio of the Bronsted acid to the organoaluminum compound is less than or equal to about 2:1. Also provided are compositions comprising at least: a) Bronsted acidic cation [QmH]+, wherein H is a proton, m is 1 or 2, each Q is Lewis base, and each Lewis base<br>
Q can be the same as, or different from, any other Lewis base Q; and b) aluminate anion chemically bonded to at least one carrier, wherein each of a majority of aluminum atoms in the aluminate anion is chemically bonded to at least two oxygen atoms on the surface of the carrier, wherein the composition is derived from at least a) compound derived from at least (i) carrier having at least one pair of hydrogen bonded hydroxyl groups, (ii) organoaluminum compound, and (iii) the Qm; and b) Bronsted acid. In such methods and compositions, a majority of the hydroxyl groups on the carrier can be in hydrogen bonded form. This invention also provides such compositions that are suitable for activating an alkylated transition metal component by protonation. [0006]    As will be familiar to those skilled in the art, the terms "combined" and "combining" as used herein mean that the components that are "combined" or that one is "combining" are put into a container with each other. Likewise a "combination" of components means the components having been put together in a container. The term "pair of hydrogen bonded hydroxyl groups" as used herein means at least two hydroxyl groups on the carrier that are close enough to interact with each other through hydrogen-oxygen bonding. Also, as used herein, the term "majority" means more than about seventy percent.<br>

[0007]    Figure 1 shows the OH regions of three IR spectra: (i) spectrum of silica<br>
treated at 150°C, (ii) spectrum of silica treated at 200°C, and (iii) spectrum of silica<br>
treated at 600°C.<br>
[0008]    Figure 2 shows the OH and NH regions of an IR spectrum of an activator<br>

catalyst based on an activator composition derived according to this Invention.<br>
Carriers/Supports<br>
[0010]    Carriers having at least two hydrogen bonded hydroxyl groups, e.g., at least one pair of hydrogen bonded hydroxyl groups, useful in compositions according to this invention comprise inorganic carriers or organic carriers. Such carriers are either non-calcined or low-temperature calcined. As used herein, a "non-calcined" carrier is a carrier that has not purposely been subjected to calcining treatment, and a "low-<br>
emperature calcined" carrier is carrier that has been calcined at a temperature up to<br>
about 400°C, or about 100°C to about 400°C, or at about 200°C. The calcination time<br>
can be about 1 to about 24 hours. Further, the calcination may be performed in any<br>
atmosphere, for example, in an atmosphere of air or an inert gas such as nitrogen, or<br>
under a vacuum. We have observed that such non-calcined or low-temperature<br>
calcined carriers, e.g., silicas, have an increased concentration of hydrogen bonded<br>
hydroxyl groups and a negligible amount of strained siloxane rings. See also M. E.<br>
Bartram et al., J. Phys. Chem., 1991, Vol. 95, pp. 4453 - 4463.<br>
[0011]   A plurality of carriers can be used as a mixture. A carrier of this invention may<br>
be porous and have a micro pore volume of not less than 0.1 ml/g of silica, or not less<br>
than 0.3 ml/g. A carrier of this invention may have a micro pore volume of about 1.6<br>
ml/g of silica. The average particle diameter of the carrier may be from about 5<br>
micrometers to about 1000 micrometers, or from about 10 micrometers to about 500<br>
micrometers.<br>
[0012]    One silica useful in this invention is porous and has a surface area in the<br>
range of from about 10 m2/g silica to about 1000 m2/g silica, including the range of<br>
about 10 m2/g silica to about 700 m2/g silica, a total pore volume in the range of from<br>
about 0.1 cc/g silica to about 4.0 cc/g silica, and an average particle diameter in the<br>
range of from about 10 micrometers to about 500 micrometers. A silica useful in this<br>
invention can have a surface area in the range of from about 50 m2/g to about 500<br>
m2/g, a pore volume in the range of from abcut 0.5 cc/g to about 3.5 cc/g, and an<br>
average particle diameter in the range of from about 15 micrometers to about 150<br>
micrometers. A useful silica may have a surface area in the range of from about 200<br>
m2/g to about 350 m2/g, a pore volume in the range of from about 1.0 cc/g to about 2.0<br>
cc/g, and an average particle diameter in the range of from about 10 micrometers to<br>
about 110 micrometers.<br>
[0013]    An average pore diameter of a typical porous silicon dioxide carrier useful in<br>
this invention is in the range of from about 10 angstroms to about 1000 angstroms, or<br>
from about 50 angstroms to about 500 angstroms, or from about 175 angstroms to<br>
about 350 angstroms. A typical content of hydroxyl groups in carriers of this invention<br>
is from about 2.5 mmol OH/g silica to about 4.0 mmol OH/g silica, as determined by<br>
titration with triethylaluminum. Most of these active OH groups react readily with<br>
triethylaluminum to produce ethane, and this reaction can be used to quantify the<br>
concentration of active OH groups on a particular silica. A typical content of hydroxyl<br>
 [roups is from about 0.10 mmol OH/g silica to about 10 mmol OH/g silica, or about 1.0<br>
mmol OH/g silica to about 5.0 mmol OH/g silica, or from about 2.5 mmol OH/g silica to<br>
about 4.0 mmol OH/g silica.<br>
[0014]    Example inorganic carriers that may be useful in this invention include<br>
inorganic oxides, magnesium compounds, clay minerals and the like. The inorganic<br>
oxides can comprise silica, alumina, silica-alumina, magnesia, titania, zirconia, and<br>
clays. Example inorganic oxides useful in this invention include, without limitation,<br>

e.g. SiO2-Al2O3, SiO2-MgO, SiO2-iO2, SiO2-TiO2-MgO. Example magnesium<br>
compounds useful in this invention include MgCI2, MgCI(OEt) and the like. Example<br>

clay, allophane, hisingerite, pyrophylite, talc, micas, montmorillonites, vermiculite,<br>
chlorites, palygorskite, kaolinite, nacrite, dickite, halloysite and the like.<br>
[0015]    Example organic carriers that may be useful in this invention include acrylic<br>
polymer, styrene polymer, ethylene polymer, propylene polymer and the like. Example<br>

monomers such as acrylonitrile, methyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, methacrylonitrile<br>
and the like, and copolymers of the monomers and crosslinking polymerizable<br>
compounds having at least two unsaturated bonds. Example styrene polymers that<br>
may be useful in this invention include polymers of styrene monomers such as styrene,<br>
vinyltoluene, ethylvinylbenzene and the like, and copolymers of the monomers and<br>
crosslinking polymerizable compounds having at least two unsaturated bonds. Example<br>
crosslinking polymerizable compound having at least two unsaturated bonds include<br>
divinylbenzene, trivinylbenzene, divinyltoluene, divinylketone, diallyl phthalate, diallyl<br>
maleate, N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, polyethylene<br>

thiocarboxyl group, thioformyl group, pyrrolyl group, imidazolyl group, piperidyl group,<br>
indazolyl group and carbazolyl group. When the organic carrier originally has at least<br>
one polar functional group, the organic carrier can be used as it is. One or more kinds<br>
of polar functional groups can also be introduced by subjecting the organic carrier as a matrix to a suitable chemical treatment. The chemical treatment may be any method capable of introducing one or more polar functional groups into the organic carrier. For example, it may be a reaction between acrylic polymer and polyalkylenepolyamine such as ethylenediamine, propanediamine, diethylenetriamine, tetraethylenepentamine, dipropylenetriamine or the like. As the specific method of such a reaction, for example, there is a method of treating an acrylic polymer (e.g. polyacrylonitrile) in a slurry state in a mixed solution of ethylenediamine and water at 100°C or more, for example from 120°C to 150°C. The amount of polar functional group per unit gram in the organic carrier having a polar functional group may be from 0.01 to 50 mmol/g, or from 0.1 to 20 mmol/g.<br>

Bronsted Acids<br>
[0021]    Bronsted acid, i.e., a compound capable of donating a proton, useful in this invention can comprise R5OH, wherein R5 is an organic compound containing at least one electron withdrawing group. The Bronsted acid can be 2,6-difluorophenol, pentafluorophenol, 4-fluorophenol, or any phenol that is acidic enough to react with any aluminum alkyl group on the organoaluminum compound.<br>
Preparation of Compositions of this Invention<br>
[0022]   Activator compositions according to this invention can be derived from at least<br>
(a) compound derived from at least (i) carrier having at least one pair of hydrogen<br>
bonded hydroxyl groups, (ii) organoaluminum compound, and (iii) Lewis base, and (b)<br>
.Bronsted acid. The carrier can be combined with the organoaluminum compound to<br>
form first product; at least a portion of the first product can be combined with the Lewis<br>
base to form a second product; and at least a portion of the second product can be<br>
combined with the Bronsted acid in amounts sufficient and under condition sufficient to<br>
form a Bronsted acidic activator. When the compound is derived from carrier,<br>
organoaluminum compound, and Lewis base, the organoaluminum compound can be<br>
added in stoichiometric excess, e.g., more than a 1:2 ratio of Al to active OH groups on<br>
the carrier, to form a chelating aluminum structure. The Lewis base can remove most<br>
of the stoichiometric excess organoaluminum from the carrier surface. The Lewis base<br>
and the organoaluminum can then stay in the reaction media, and can be removed by<br>
filtration and wash. The resulting material thus has a near maximum chelating<br>
aluminum content.<br>
[0023]    The organoaluminum compound can be combined with Lewis base to form<br>
first product, at least a portion of the first product can be combined with the carrier to<br>
form second product, and at least a portion of the second product can be combined<br>
with the Bronsted acid in amounts sufficient and under condition sufficient to form the<br>
Bronsted acidic activator.<br>
[0024]    This invention provides that the carrier having at least one pair of hydrogen<br>
bonded hydroxyl groups, the organoaluminum compound, and the Lewis base can be<br>
combined such that the resulting product has a ratio of (mmol SiO on the carrier)/(g<br>
carrier) to (mmol aluminum)/(g carrier) from about 1.80:1 to about 2.20:1, or about<br>
1.85:1 to about 2.05:1, or about 2:1. The SiO's are derived from SiOH groups that exist<br>
on the carrier prior to the combining.<br>
[0025]    The combining can be conducted in an inert gas atmosphere; at a temperature<br>
from about -80°C to about 200°C, or from about 0°C to about 120°C; the combining<br>
time can be from about 1 minute to about 36 hours, or from about 10 minutes to about<br>
24 hours. Solvent used for preparing activator composition can comprise aliphatic<br>
solvent or aromatic solvent, either of which is inert to the carrier, the organoaluminum  —<br>
compound, the Lewis base, and the Bronsted acid. Example treatments after<br>
completion of the combining operation include filtration of supernatant, followed by<br>
washing with inert solvent and evaporation of solvent under reduced pressure or in inert<br>
gas flow, but these treatments are not required. Resulting activator composition can be<br>
used for polymerization in any suitable state, including fluid, dry, or semi-dry powder,<br>
and may be used for polymerization in the state of being suspended in inert solvent.<br>
The combining of carrier having at least one pair of hydrogen bonded hydroxyl groups<br>
with organoaluminum compound and Lewis base can be conducted at ambient<br>
temperature and at a combining time of from about 15 minutes to about 48 hours, or<br>
from about 15 minutes to about 6 hours; the resulting combination can be used as is or<br>
subsequently heated to a temperature of about 40°C to about 120°C. Alternatively, the<br>
combining of carrier having at least one pair of hydrogen bonded hydroxy! groups with<br>
organoaluminum compound and Lewis base can be conducted at a temperature of from<br>
about 40°C to about 120°C at a combining time of from about 15 minutes to about 6<br>
hours. At least a portion of resulting product is combined with Bronsted acid.<br>
[0026]   The amount of aluminum atoms in the product, e.g., solid component,<br>
obtained by combining carrier having at least one pair of hydrogen bonded hydroxyl<br>
groups, organoaluminum compound, and Lewis base can be not less than about 0.1<br>
mmol aluminum atom, or not less than about 1 mmol aluminum atom, in 1 g of the solid<br>
component in the dry state. The amount cf aluminum atoms in the product is<br>
determined by the content of hydroxyl groups on the carrier that are capable of reacting<br>
with the organoaluminum compound. For example, hydroxyl groups either under the<br>
surface or in relatively small pores of the carrier may not be capable of reacting with the<br>
organoaluminum compound; additionally, the bulkiness of the organoaluminum<br>
compound can interfere with the ability of certain hydroxyl groups to react with the<br>
organoaluminum compound. See, e.g., Example 2-1-3.<br>
Catalysts for olefin polymerization<br>
[0027]  Activator compositions of this invention are useful in catalysts for olefin polymerization.   Activator composition according to this invention and transition metal component may each be added independently, yet substantially simultaneously, to monomer to catalyze polymerization. Activator composition and transition metal component may be combined to form product and at least a portion ofproduct may be added to monomer to catalyze polymerization. The active proton ratio of activator composition to transition metal atom of transition metal component may be 0.1 to 4, or 0.5 to 2, or almost 1.<br>
[0028]   Activator composition is suitable for activating transition metal component by Bronsted acidity, i.e., by protonating alkylated transition metal component. Activator composition is also suitable for activating transition metal component by Lewis acidity, i.e., by accepting at least one electron pair from transition metal component. The amount of activator composition combined with transition metal component may be sufficient to allow activation of transition metal component predominantly by Bronsted acidity; e.g., 30% or more, 70% or more, or 90% or more of activation may occur due to Bronsted acidity. The amount of activator composition combined with transition metal component may be sufficient to allow activation of transition metal component substantially by Bronsted acidity, e.g., 95% or more, or 98% or more of activation may occur due to Bronsted acidity. Activator composition may be combined with transition metal component either before combining with monomer or while simultaneously combining with monomer. Given a known activator composition and a known transition metal component, one skilled in the art can determine the amount of the activator composition to combine with transition metal component to allow activation predominantly or substantially by Bronsted acidity.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
[0043]    The following examples are illustrative of the principles of this invention. It is understood that this invention is not limited to any one specific embodiment exemplified herein, whether in the examples or the remainder of this patent application.<br>
[0044]    EXAMPLE 1 - Structures of Hydroxy! Groups on Silica [0045]    This example compares the differences of silica calcined at low ( 400°C) temperatures. Three raw silica (Grace 952) samples, each containing about 800g in a steel beaker, were heated in an oven for 4 hours at 150°C, 200°C, and 600°C, respectively. Subsequently, each sample was allowed to cool and was maintained at 100°C before being transferred into a drybox under nitrogen protection. Each of the three samples was then analyzed by FT-IR spectroscopy. Their proton-stretching frequency regions are shown in Figure 1.<br>
6046]   Si-OH species on silica surface are mainly in isolated (C) and hydrogen bonded (D) forms, which can be identified by infrared (IR) spectroscopy.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
(IR frequency assignment by Lenza and Vasconcelos, Materials Research, 4 (2001) 189)<br>
[0047]    Figure 1 shows the IR spectra of silica (Grace 952) pretreated at 150°C, 200°C, and 600°C, respectively, in the proton-stretching frequency region. It can be seen that the two silica samples pretreated at 150°C and 200°C, respectively, contain significantly more hydrogen bonded hydroxyl pairs than the silica sample pretreated at 600°C. Coordinated molecular water was also observed for the two silica samples pretreated at lower temperatures, showing as a broad peak at 3540 cm"1 (also assigned by Lenza and Vasconcelos, Materials Research, 4 (2001) 189). To avoid the influence of aluminoxane formed by the reaction of organoaluminum compound with the coordinated water, the silica sample containing less coordinated water, i.e., the silica pretreated at 200°C, was used for studies.   Schrijnemakers and co-workers have quantified the amounts of isolated (C) and hydrogen bonded (D) hydroxyl groups on different temperature calcined silica samples (Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys, 1 (1999) 2569, where the isolated and hydrogen bonded hydroxyl groups are called free and bridged hydroxyl groups, respectively). For example, a silica sample pretreated at 473°C contains a C:D ratio of 1.0:3.7, the same silica pretreated at 573°C contains a C:D ratio of 2.6:1.5, and the same silica pretreated at 973°C contains a C:D ratio of 1.05:0.05. The conclusion from experimental results is that in silica calcined at 
EXAMPLE 2 - The Construction of Chelating Aluminum Centers Using the Hydrogen Bonded Hydroxyl Groups on Carrier as the Chelating Agent [0048]    Non-chelating anion containing a boron or aluminum center in a catalytic ion-pair has been found to be unstable and to cause deactivation either in a solution phase (e.g., Marks et al, Organometallics, 19 (2000) 1625) or on silica surface (e.g., Basset et<br>
J. Am. Chem. Soc, 128 (2006) 9361). This Example 2 shows how to maximize the amount of chelating aluminum centers on the silica surface by using Lewis Base (e.g., a tertiary amine) to treat an organoaluminum treated, low temperature calcined silica where a majority of hydroxyl groups are in hydrogen bonded form. The resulting product can be used as the precursor of a chelating aluminate anion in a catalyst ion-pair to construct a much more stable silica supported Bronsted acidic activator system.<br>
2-1. Determination of TEA Reactive OH Content on 200°C Calcined Silica and Measurement of AI-Et:AI Ratio on TEA Treated Silica to Quantify Chelating Aluminum Content<br>
[0049]    The organoaluminum compound, e.g., AIEt3, can react with a pair of hydrogen bonded hydroxyl groups on the carrier surface and lose two of its three ethyl groups, resulting in formation of a chelating aluminum structure containing only one ethyl group on the aluminum. Theoretically, matching one equivalent of organoaluminum compound to two equivalents of hydrogen bonded hydroxyl groups should result in all aluminum atoms being in chelating form. However, silica calcined at 150-200°C still contains a significant amount of isolated OH groups that consume an equal mole of the organoaluminum compound.   To ensure no unreacted OH groups are left on the surface, a stoichiometric excess charge greater than a 1:2 ratio of AI:OH is required. Therefore, with the stoichiometric excess organoaluminum compound treatment, instead of every pair of hydrogen bonded hydroxyl groups sharing one aluminum center to form a di-substituted (or chelating) organoaluminum compound derivative, some pairs of the hydrogen bonded hydroxyl groups can each react with two organoaluminum compound, e.g., AIEt.3, to form two mono-substituted organoaluminum compound derivatives, i.e., losing only one ethyl group for each AIEt3. The ratio of AI-Et:AI on the carrier surface is therefore increased to become significantly greater than 1:1. The AI-Et:AI ratio can thus be considered as a gauge to measure aluminum atoms in chelating form, i.e., the closer to 1:1 the AI-Et:AI ratio, the more aluminum atoms in chelating form.<br>
2-1 -1. Preparation of Excess TEA Treated Silica<br>
[0050]    Silica Grace 952 after 200°C calcination (2.50 g) was weighed into a 20mL vial and mixed with dry toluene (5g). The slurry was agitated. Triethylaluminum (TEA 1.003g (8.78 mmol, based on 3.52 mmol/g SiO2 charge) was weighed into a small vial<br>
and mixed with dry toluene (2g). The TEA solution was then slowly added to the silica slurry. After agitating at ambient conditions overnight, the reaction mixture was filtered, washed twice with toluene (2g), washed with isohexane (4g), and dried under vacuum to constant weight. The dry, free flowing powder was 3.2688g (Solid A) and the combined weight of solvents after filtration and washes was 14.057g (Solution B).<br>
2-1-2. Determination of AI-Et:AI Ratio in TEA Treated Silica<br>
2-1-2-a Aluminum Content<br>
[0051]    The Al content determined for Solid A by ICP was 4.22%, corresponding to<br>
3.2688g (Solid A)(4.22%)/(27g/mcl)(2.50g) = 2.04 mmol Al/(g silica). TEA content in<br>
Solution B determined by quantitative NMR analysis was 3.48 mmol. The TEA<br>
consumed by silica was 8.78 - 3.48 = 5.30 mmol or 5.30/2.50 = 2.12 mmol Al/(g silica),<br>
very close to the ICP result.   This is a verification of the Al content.<br>
2-1-2-b Et Residue on Aluminum<br>
[0052]    The content of Al-Et units on TEA treat silica was quantified with CF3COOH-NMR titration in a sealed system, giving 2.19 (mmol OH)/(g TEA treated silica), corresponding to (2.19)(3.2688)/2.50 = 2.86 (mmol OH)/(g siiica). Therefore, the excess TEA treated silica has a AI-Et:AI ratio = 2.86:2.04 = 1.40:1 (mol:mol), indicating 40mol% of Al has two Et groups. Al content from ICP was used for calculation because it was a direct result from the final product. The fact that there are 40 mol% of Al with two ethyl groups suggests that these Al are mono-substituted and, therefore, not irr chelating form.<br>
[0053]    Details of the CF3COOH-NMR titration procedures are as follows: A specially designed NMR tube consisting of an upper chamber and a TEFLON cap was used. The upper chamber is so designed that when the CF3COOH solution is loaded in the chamber, there is no contact between the CF3COOH solution and the organoaluminum treated silica slurry in the lower part of the NMR tube. Then the tube is turned upside down to allow the two reagents to come into contact and react. In the drybox, exact amounts of both trialkylaSuminum treated silica and an internal standard such as 1,2-diphenylethane (DPE) are weighed into the lower part of the NMR tube. Then a deuterated solvent such as CSD6 is loaded in the NMR tube in such a way that the possible head-space is reduced; this is done to minimize error caused by gas escaping from the solution to the head-space. Then, an excess amount of CF3OOH solution in<br>
The same deuterated solvent is loaded in the upper chamber. The NMR tube is then sealed with the TEFLON cap. The NMR tube is then turned upside down to allow the contact of the two reagents, followed by vigorous shaking for 10 minutes and then settling for 60 minutes. During the 60 minute period of time, 1H-NMR is checked occasionally to ensure that there is no additional formation of alkane (e.g., for TEA treated silica, ethane). With known amounts of both organoaluminum treated silica and the internal reference, the Al-R content can be calculated. This analytical method gives a 95% or better confidence for ethane and isobutane released from the reaction of Al-Et and AI-'Bu fragments on silica with CF3COOH, respectively.<br>
2-1-3. Determination of TEA Reactive OH Content on 200 °C Calcined Silica [0054]    OH content is measurement method dependent. For example, while the physical treatment method such as LOI (Loss on ignition) gives a higher OH content because both the OH groups under the surface and on the surface can lose water through heating treatment, the chemical reaction method only measures the surface OH groups and thus gives a lower OH content. Furthermore, the surface OH groups located in different pore sizes of silica are also sensitive to the steric bulkiness of the chemical reagent, i.e., a larger chemical reagent can only react with OH groups in a larger size pore, giving an even lower OH content. For example, the LOI method gave about 4 mmol OH/g silica, the TEA-NMR titration gave about 3.26 mmol OH/g silica, and the benzyl Grignard-NMR titrations gave only about 2.03 mmol OH/g silica for the same silica calcined at 200°C. Because TEA is used as the reagent to construct the activator species, OH content determined by TEA-NMR titration is used in this application. The OH content determined by TEA-NMR titration is thus called TEA reactive OH content.<br>
[0055]    In Example 2-1-2, the TEA treated silica contains 2.04 mmol Al /(g silica) and 2.86 mmol AI-Et/(g silica). All the Al are from the TEA. Therefore, the TEA reactive OH content should equal the loss of Et groups from TEA, and can be derived:<br>
TEA reactive OH = (2.04)(3) - 2.86 = 3.26 (mmol OH)/(g silica)<br>
Therefore, on the surface of the 200°C calcined Grace 952 silica, there are 3.26 mmol OH/(g silica), which are TEA reactive.<br>
2-2. Al-Et:AI Ratio on Excess TEA Treated Silica after Lewis Base Treatment [0056]   This example shows how the Lewis base can convert most of the 40% non-chelating aluminum to chelating form by removal of the excess organoaluminum compound.<br>
[0057]    The Lewis base used in this experiment is PhNMe2. PhNMe2 (0.482g, 3.95 mmol) in toluene (2g) was added to TEA treated silica from Example 2-1-1 (Solid A, 1.476g, containing 2.31 mmol Al) in toluene (5g). Then the slurry was heated in a 70°C oil-bath for 1 hr while agitating. The slurry was then filtered, washed twice with 2g toluene and once with 4g isohexane, and dried under vacuum for 1 hr, giving 1.298g free-flowing powder (Solid A'). The combined filtrate and washes 6.838g (Solution B') were analyzed with NMR, giving a total 0.39mmol TEA in the Solution B\ corresponding to 0.39 (mmol TEA)/1.476(g Solid A) = 0.264 (mmol TEA)/(g Solid A); 0.264 (mmol TEA)/(g Solid A) x 3.2688(g Solid A)/2.50 (g Si02) - 0.345 mmol/(g Si02) of TEA that was washed off from the excess TEA treated silica. [0058]    Similar analyses of ICP and CF3COOH titration in Example 2-1 for Al and Al-Et contents for Solid A* gave a 1.08:1 (mol:mol) of AI-Et:AI ratio.   The final AI:Et:AI ratio of 1.08:1 suggests that more than 90moi% of Al are now in the chelating form and that the isolated Si-OH (C) is estimated as not higher than 8 mol% based on total TEA reactive OH groups.<br>
EXAMPLE 3 - Preparation of Final Supported Catalyst from Excess TEA Treated Silica with and without Lewis Base Treatment<br>
[0059]    Silica Grace 948 calcined at 200°C for four hours was used for the studies. Grace 948 silica was also analyzed with methods similar to Example 2. The TEA reactive OH content was determined to be 3.21 (mmol OH)/(g silica),<br>
3-1. Preparation of Excess TEA Treated Silica<br>
[0060]    In the drybox, silica Grace 948 from calcination at 200°C for four hours (20.0g, containing total 20x3.21 = 64.2mmol TEA reactive OH) was slurried into toluene (75g) in a 250mL three-neck round bottom flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer. TEA (5.0g, 43.7 mmol or 43.7x3 = 131.1 mmol Al-Et) and toluene (15g) were charged into a 50mL beaker. The TEA solution was then slowly added to the silica slurry with<br>
gitation. The mixture was allowed to agitate at ambient conditions for 30 min, followed by heating at 70°C for 2 hr in an oil-bath. The stirrer was stopped and the mixture was allowed to cool to ambient. The mixture was then filtered through a coarse frit, washed 3 times with 10g toluene and once with 10g isohexane, and dried under vacuum overnight. Yield: 22.7g (Al: 4.1% by ICP; Toluene: 1.3% by NMR; Net weight: 22.4g). The combined filtrate and washes were analyzed by quantitative NMR analysis and showed a total excess of TEA in the solution of 1.04g. An AI-Et:AI ratio of 1.4:1.0 was obtained through a CF3COOH-NMR titration analysis. Both Al% and AI-Et:AI ratio agree with the results derived from the starting material weights and the final product weight. Details are as follows: The weight of TEA fragments on the TEA treated silica was 22.4g product-22.0g silica = 2.4g. The total TEA consumption = 5.0g charge -1.04g excess = 3.96g consumed. The consumed TEA contains (27)(3.96)/114.2 = 0.936g Al (Al atom weight 27g/mol and TEA molecular weight 114.2g/mol). Therefore, Al% = 0.936/22.4 = 4.17%. The consumed 3.96g of TEA (AIEt3) became 2.4g (AIEtx) (TEA fragments) on silica due to the loss of Et groups. The x of the AIEtx fragment was calculated as 1.43 (Et portion is 2.4g AIEtx- 0.936g Al = 1.464g, or 1.464/29 = 0.050 mol (the Et group is 29g/mol). Al = 0.936/27 = 0.035 mol. Therefore, AI:Et = 0.035:0.050 = 1:1.43)<br>
3-2. Preparation of Supported Catalyst from Excess TEA Treated Silica without Lewis Base Treatment (Comparative Example)<br>
[0061]    The final catalyst preparation consists of three steps: 1) the preparation of an ionic Bronsted acid (IBA) (according to Reaction 1); 2) the construction of a supported Bronsted acidic activator A (according to Reaction 2); and 3) the activation of an alkylated metallocene with the supported activator A to form the final catalyst B (according to Reaction 3).<br>

<br>
3-2-1. Preparation of Supported Bronsted Acidic Activator [0062]    In the drybox, TEA treated silica (1.05g, containing 1.59mmol Al/g) from Example 3-1 was mixed with 3.0g toluene in a 20 ml_ vial. C6F5OH (0.250g, 1.36 mmol) and PhNMe2 (0.083g, 0.68 mmol) were charged into a 4mL vial with toluene (1g) to form ionic Bronsted acid (IBA) (see Reaction 1). The IBA solution was then added to the TEA treated silica slurry slowly, followed by shaking on a shaker for 1 hr. The resulting mixture was then filtered and washed with toluene (3g), and dried under vacuum for 30 seconds.<br>
3-2-2. Preparation of Supported Catalyst<br>
[0063]    The wet solid from Example 3-2-1 was slurried into toluene (3g). A commercially available bis(dialkyl substituted cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dimethyl solution (0.133 g.19.6% in toluene, 66.6 |j.mol Zr) was then added at once to the slurry, followed by shaking on a shaker for 1 hr. The orange mixture was filtered, washed twice with 3g toluene and once with 5g isohexane, and dried under vacuum for 30 min. Yield: 1.1 Og (Al: 3.13% and Zr: 0.46% from ICP). The solid was tested for ethylene polymerization based on the procedure described in Example 5 and the results are listed in Table 1 Entry 1.<br>
-3. Preparation of Supported Catalyst from Excess TEA Treated Silica with Lewis Base Treatment (Invention Example)<br>
[0064]    This example used PhNMe2 as the Lewis base to treat the TEA treated silica. After the PhNMe2 treatment, part of this compound remained on the TEA treated silica surface (as shown as D' in Reaction 4). Construction of the supported Bronsted acidic activator A (as shown in Reaction 5) was done by adding C6F5OH. Use of the IBA compound was not needed.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
<br>
3-3-1. Preparation of Supported Bronsted Acidic Activator<br>
3-3-1-a. Treatment of excess TEA treated silica with PhNMe2<br>
[0065]    In a drybox, TEA treated silica (3.04g) from Example 3-1 was charged with<br>
toluene (10g) in a 20mL vial. PhNMe2 (0.36g. 3.0 mmol) was added at once to the TEA<br>
treated silica slurry with agitation, followed by heating at 75°C in an oil-bath for 1 hr.<br>
The mixture was then filtered, washed 3 times with 3g toluene and once with 6g<br>
isohexane, then dried under vacuum for 1 hr. Yield: 3.34g (wet).<br>
3-3-1-b. Preparation of Supported Bronsted Acidic Activator [0066]    The wet solid from Example 3-3-1-a was divided into three equal portions P1, P2 and P3 (1.11g for each). P1 and P2 were used for catalyst preparation while P3 was saved for other use. To P1 and P2 each in a 20mL vial was charged toluene 4g, respectively. Then the C6F5OH solutions (0.19g or 1.03 mmol in 1 g toluene for P1 and 0.28g or 1.52 mmol in 2g toluene for P2) were added slowly to P1 and P2, respectively.<br>
She resulting mixtures were shaken on a shaker for 1 hr. Then each of the two samples was filtered, washed with 3g toluene, and dried under vacuum for 30 seconds, resulting in two wet solid samples: Q1 from P1; and Q2 from P2.<br>
[0067]    In this step, we have found that the ratio of the total CeF5OH to Al on silica can be much less than 2:1 (the theoretical ratio of structure A in Reaction 2) to form a desired amount of activator species A. In this example, even with a higher C6F5OH charge for P2, the ratio is 1.52 mmol C6F5OH:1.54 mmol Al (based on 4.2% Al from ICP that gives 1.54 mmol Al/g silica), which is close to 1:1 only. By use of IR spectroscopy analysis, the formation of the Bronsted acidic activator having a N-H stretching frequency at 3252 cm"1 can be clearly seen (Figure 2). And with CF3COOH-NMR titration, both Al-Et and AI-OC6F5 units can be detected and quantified. More than 50% of Al-Et remains after C6F5OH treatment, showing that species A and D* coexist in the system.<br>
3-3-1 -c. Preparation of Supported Bronsted Acidic Activator for IR Analysis [0068]    A similar preparation based on procedures in Examples 3-3-1-a and 3-3-1-b<br>
was used to prepare an IR sample, which was vacuum dried to constant weight and analyzed by FT-IR spectroscopy to obtain an IR spectrum shown as Figure 2 in the proton stretching region. Figure 2 clearly shows a N-H stretching frequency at about 3252 cm"1, indicating the formation of the activator A.<br>
3-3-2. Preparation of Supported Catalysts<br>
3-3-2-a. Preparation of Supported Catalysts for Polymerization Tests [0069]    The two wet solid samples Q1 and Q2 from Example 3-3-1 b were slurried with toluene (3g for each) in a 20mL vial, respectively. To each of the slurries was added a commercially available bis(dialkyl substituted cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dimethyl solution (0.128g, 19.6%, 64 micromof Zr), followed by shaking on a shaker for 1 hr. Each of the two samples was filtered, washed three times with 3g toluene and once with 3g isohexane, then dried under vacuum for 1 hr, giving a free flowing a solid R1 from Q1 1.03g (Al: 2.88% and Zr: 0.50% from ICP) and a free flowing solid R2 from Q2 1.08g (Al: 2.80% and Zr: 0.50% from ICP). The two samples were tested for ethylene polymerization based on procedures given in Example 5. The results are listed in Table 1 (R1 in Entry 2 and R2 in Entry 3).<br>
•3-2-b. Preparation of Supported Catalyst for IR Analysis [0070]   A solid from Example 3-3-1 -c was used to prepare a final catalyst based on procedures in Example 3-3-2-a and the resulting supported catalyst solid was analyzed by FT-IR spectroscopy. The proton-stretching region is shown as Figure 3. Comparing to Figure 2, it can be clearly seen that the N-H stretching frequency has diminished, indicating that the reaction of an alkylated metailocene and the active proton on PhNMe2 of the activator A has occurred to generate the active catalyst B. NMR analysis of the supernate from the reaction of the activator A with an alkylated metailocene in a sealed system also detected more than 90 mol% of methane formation based on the metailocene charge, further confirming the Bronsted acid activation as the major activation pathway for this system.<br>
3-4 Preparation of Supported Catalyst from Excess TEA Treated Silica with Lewis Base Treatment (Invention Example) on a Larger Scale<br>
[0071]    In the drybox, excess TEA treated silica from Example 3-1 (15.4g, containing<br>
4.1% Al) was mixed with toluene (64g) in a 250mL three-neck round bottom flask<br>
equipped with a mechanical stirrer. PhNMe2 (1.9g, 15.6mmol) was added at once to<br>
the TEA treated silica slurry with agitation. The resulting mixture was agitated at<br>
ambient conditions for 3 min, then heated at 70°C in an oil-bath for 1 hr.   The mixture<br>
was then filtered, washed with toluene (10g), and dried under vacuum for 1 hr. Yield:<br>
14.0g (Al: 3.4%). It can be seen that the amine removed excess TEA therefore the<br>
mass was reduced from 15.4g to 14.0g. The Al% was also reduced accordantly.<br>
[0072]    The amine treated solid was reslurried into 43g toluene, followed by agitating<br>
at ambient conditions. C6F5OH (3.1g, 16.8 mmol, or 0.24g/g) was mixed with toluene<br>
(6g) in a 20mL vial and slowly added to the amine treated solid. The mixture was<br>
agitated for 1.2 hr at ambient. Then it was filtered, washed with toluene (10g), and<br>
dried under vacuum for 3 hr. The solid was reslurried to toluene (35g). Then a<br>
commercially available bis(dialkyl substituted cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dimethyl<br>
solution (1.34g, 19.6% in toluene, containing 671 micromol Zr) was added to the slurry<br>
with agitation. The mixture was allowed to agitate at ambient conditions for 1 hour, and<br>
then placed at ambient conditions overnight. The mixture was then filtered, washed<br>
with toluene (15g) twice and isohexane (15g) twice, and dried under vacuum for 2 hr.<br>
Yield: 16.4g (Al: 2.9% and Zr: 0.23% from ICP). The PE polymerization test was carried<br>
at based on procedures given in Example 5 and the results are listed in Table 1 Entry 4.<br>
EXAMPLE 4 - More Comparative Examples<br>
4-1 Preparation of Supported Catalyst from Stoichiometric Control of TEA Treated Silica without Lewis Base Treatment<br>
[0073]   The same silica Grace 952 after 200°C calcination for 4 hours as used in Examples 1 and 2 was used in this example. In the dry box, silica (21.3g, 69.4 mmol TEA reactive OH) was charged with toluene (90.8g) in a 250mL three-neck round bottom flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer. Based on the TEA reactive OH content 3.26 (mmol OH)/(g silica) (see Example 2-1-3), TEA (4.2g, 36.8mmol, 53mol% of TEA reactive OH content) was mixed with toluene (12g) and then slowly added to the silica slurry with agitation. After agitation at ambient conditions for 30 min, the reaction temperature was brought to 70°C with an oil-bath for 2 hours. The mixture was allowed to cool to ambient temperature, then filtered through a coarse frit, washed with toluene (10g) three times and isohexane (20g), then dried under vacuum for 3 hr. Yield: 23.9g (Al: 4.15% from ICP; Et:AI = 1.17:1.0 from combined NMR and ICP analyses); Quantitative NMR analysis for the combination of supernate and washes gave total 0.051 g TEA (1.2% of 4.2g charge).<br>
[0074]    In the drybox, TEA treated silica from Example 4-1-1 (1.0g. containing 1.53mmol Al) was charged in a 20mL vial with toluene (4g). C6F5OH (0.24g, 1.30mmol) and PhNMe2 (0.080g, 0.655 mmol) was mixed with toluene (1g) in a 4mL vial (IBA formation, see Reaction 1). The IBA solution was then slowly added to the TEA treated silica slurry with agitation. The mixture was then shaken on a shaker for 1 hr. The mixture was then filtered, washed with toluene (3g), and dried under vacuum for 30 seconds (Activator formation, see Reaction 2). The wet solid was then reslurried into toluene (3g). Commercially available bis(dialkyl substituted cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dimethyl solution (0.144g, 19.6% toluene solution, 72 micromol) was added to the slurry, followed by shaking for 40 min (Final catalyst formation, see Reaction 3). The red brown mixture was then filtered, washed with toluene (3g) three times and isohexane (5g), and dried under vacuum for 2 hr. Yield: 1.20g (Al: 3.30% and Zr: 0.52% from ICP). The PE polymerization test was carried out based on procedures in Example 5 and the results are listed in Table 1 Entry 5.<br>
4-2 Preparation of Supported Catalyst from Excess TEA Treated Silica with C6F5OH as Lewis Base and Bronsted Acid<br>
[0075]    This example shows that the Bronsted acidic C6F5OH can also function as a Lewis base to remove the excess Al off the carrier to maximize chelating Al content. [0076]    In the drybox, 200°C calcined Grace 948 silica used in Example 3 (1.0g, containing 3.21 mmol OH) was charged with toluene (3g) in a 20mL vial. TEA (0.25g, 2.2mmol) in toluene (1g) prepared in a 4mL vial was slowly added to the silica slurry with agitation. The mixture was then heated at 70°C in an oil-bath for 2 hr. The mixture was then filtered, washed with toluene (3g), and dried under vacuum for 30 seconds. The wet solid was reslurried into toluene (3g). C6F5OH (0.26g, 1.41 mmol) was mixed with toluene (1g) in a 4mL vial. The C6F5OH solution was then slowly added to the TEA treated silica slurry with agitation. The mixture was then shaken on a shaker for 1 hr. The mixture was then filtered, washed with toluene (3g), and dried under vacuum for 30 seconds. The NMR analysis for the combination of filtrate and washes shows that excess Al was removed from the carrier in the form of H(X-3)AI(OC6F5)x (x = 3 or 4). [0077]   The wet solid was then reslurried into toluene (3g). Commercially available bis(dia!kyl substituted cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dimethyl solution (0.131g, 19.6% toluene solution, 66 micromol) was added to the slurry, followed by shaking for 1 hr. The mixture was then filtered, washed with toluene (4g) two times and isohexane (5g), and dried under vacuum for 2 hr. Yield: 1.08g (Al: 3.0% and Zr: 0.27% from ICP). The PE polymerization test was carried out based on procedures in Example 5 and the results are listed in Table 1 Entry 6.<br>
4-3 Preparation of Supported Catalyst from Excess TEA Treated Silica with C6F5OH as Lewis Base and Bronsted Acid with Silica Calcined at 600°C. [0078]    The procedures and chemical charges were similar to Example 4-2 except the silica (Grace 948) was calcined at 600°C for 4 hr. The PE polymerization test was carried out based on procedures in Example 5 and the results are listed in Table 1 Entry 7.<br>
EXAMPLE 5 - Ethylene Polymerization Tests 5-1 Procedures and Results<br>
[0079]   The dried 4 L reactor was heated to 85°C under low-pressure nitrogen flow. The reactor was pressured with isobutane and vented three times to remove nitrogen. After 1000 ml of isobutane was charged into the reactor, the reactor agitator was set at 800 rpm. After the stabilization of temperature, ethylene was charged into the reactor up to 325 psi. Then 120 ml of dried 1-hexene was charged, followed by 500 ml of isobutane. Next, 2 ml of 10% TIBA was added as scavenger agent. Typically 100 mg of solid catalyst was slurred in 2 ml of hexane (with or without 0.3g 10% TIBA) in a glovebox and then injected into the reactor, followed by another 500 ml of isobutane. The reaction pressure was maintained at 325 psi and the reaction was conducted for 60 minutes at 85°C. The reaction was stopped and isobutane was vented. The polymer was dried and weighed. The polymerization productivity of each catalyst was calculated and listed in Table 1.<br>

5-2. Discussion on Data in Table 1<br>
[0080]    Comparing Entries 1, 2, and 3, the Lewis base treatment effect is shown. Without the amine treatment of this invention, the resulting catalyst not only had a lower productivity, but also caused reactor fouling to give poor polymer morphology (Entry 1). With the amine treatment of this invention, even though the C6F5OH charge was significantly less as compared to Entry 1, the resulting catalyst performed better and produced polymer with good morphology (Entry 2). Increase of the C6F5OH charge as compared to Entry 1 further improves catalyst performance (Entry 3). Entry 4 is similar to Entries 2 and 3 with a lower Zr loading (0.23% vs. 0.50%). The Example of Entry 5 shows results when TEA was controlled to close to a 1:2 match of AI:OH; the Example of Entry 6 shows results without amine; and the Example of Entry 7 shows results from use of a 600°C calcined silica, which contains OH groups dominant in isolated form. [0081]    The above examples show that construction of chelating Al centers to form the Bronsted acidic activators for metallocenes result in compositions with good catalytic performance. Hydrogen bonded hydroxyl groups are required for the construction of such chelating aluminum structures. However, the amount of organoaluminum can also be controlled so that the AI:OH ratio is close to 1:2 either through the Lewis base treatment or by controlling the charge of the organoaluminum compound, which results in a majority of Al species being in the chelating form.<br>
[0082]   It is to be understood that the reactants and components referred to by<br>
chemical name or formula anywhere in the specification or claims hereof, whether<br>
referred to in the singular or plural, are identified as they exist prior to being combined<br>
with or coming into contact with another substance referred to by chemical name or<br>
chemical type (e.g., another reactant, a solvent, or etc.). It matters not what chemical<br>
changes, transformations and/or reactions, if any, take place in the resulting mixture or<br>
solution or reaction medium as such changes, transformations and/or reactions are the<br>
natural result of bringing the specified reactants and/or components together under the<br>
conditions called for pursuant to this disclosure. Thus the reactants and components<br>
are identified as ingredients to be brought together in connection with performing a<br>
desired chemical reaction or in forming a mixture to be used in conducting a desired<br>
reaction. Accordingly, even though the claims hereinafter may refer to substances,<br>
components and/or ingredients in the present tense ("comprises", "is", etc.), the<br>
ference is to the substance, component or ingredient as it existed at the time just before it was first contacted, combined, blended or mixed with one or more other substances, components and/or ingredients in accordance with the present disclosure. Whatever transformations, if any, which occur in situ as a reaction is conducted is what the claim is intended to cover. Thus the fact that a substance, component or ingredient may have lost its original identity through a chemical reaction or transformation during the course of contacting, combining, blending or mixing operations, if conducted in accordance with this disclosure and with the application of common sense and the ordinary skill of a chemist, is thus wholly immaterial for an accurate understanding and appreciation of the true meaning and substance of this disclosure and the claims thereof.<br>
