FERMENTATIVE PREPARATION PROCESS FOR CYTOSTATICS AND CRYSTAL FORMS THEREOF<br>
The invention relates to a new biotechnological preparation process that can be used on an industrial scale for the production of epothilones, especially a process for concentrating these compounds in the culture medium, as well as a new strain for the fennentative preparation of these compounds. The invention also relates to new crystal forms of epothilones, especially epothilone B, obtainable by the new processes, their usage in the production of pharmaceutical preparations, new pharmaceuticalpreparations comprising these new crystal forms and/or the use of these compounds in the treatment of proliferative diseases such as tumours, or in the production of phamnaceutical formulations which are suitable for this treatment.<br>
Background to the invention:<br>
Of the existing cytotoxic active ingredients for treating tumours, Taxol® (Paclitaxel; Bristol-Myers Squibb), a microtubuli-stabilising agent, plays an important role and has remarkable commercial success. However, Taxol has a number of disadvantages. In particular, its very poor solubility in water is a problem. It therefore became necessary to administer Taxol" in a formulation with Cremophor EL® (polyoxyethylated castor oil; BASF, Ludwigshafen, Germany). Cremophor EL" has severe side effects; for example it causes allergies which in at least one case have led even to the death of a patient.<br>
Although the Taxan class of microtubuli-stabilising anti-cancer agents has been commended as 'perhaps the most important addition to the pharmaceuticalannoury against cancer in the last decade" (see Rowinsky E.K., Ann, rev. Med. 48,353-374 (1997)), and despite the commercial success of Taxol®, these compounds still do not appear to represent a really great breakthrough in the chemotherapy of cancer. Treatment with Taxol" is linked with a series of significant side effects, and a few primary classes of compact tumours, namely colon and prostate tumours, respond to this compound only to a small extent (see Rowinsky E.K., inter alia). In addition, the efficacy of Taxol can be impaired and even completely neutralised by acquired resistance mechanisms, especially those based on the overexpression of phosphoproteins, which act as efflux pumps for active ingredients, such as "Multidrug Resistance" due to overexpression of the multidrug transport glycoprotein "P-glycoprotein".<br><br>
Epothilones A and B represent a new class of microtubuli-stabilising cytotoxic active ingredients (see Gerth, K. et al., J. Antibiot. 49, 560-3 (1966)) of the formulae:<br><br>
wherein R signifies hydrogen (epothilone A) or methyl (epothilone B). These compounds have the following advantages over Taxol®: ^ a) They have better water-solubility and are thus more easily accessible for formulations.<br>
b)	It has been reported that, in cell culture experiments, they are also active against the proliferation of cells, which, owing to the activity of the P-glycoprotein efflux pump making them "multidrug resistant", show resistance to treatment with other chemotherapy agents including Taxol® (see Bolag, D. M., et al., "Epothilones, a new class of microtubule-stabilizing agents with a Taxol-like mechanism of action", Cancer Research 55, 2325-33 (1995)), And<br>
c)	it could be shown that they are still very effective in vitro against a Taxol®-resistant ovarian carcinoma cell line with modified P-tubulin (see Kowalski, R. J., et al., J. Biol. Chem. 272(4). 2534-2541 (1997)).<br>
Pharmaceutical application of the epothilones, for example for tumour treatment, is possible in an analogous manner to that described for Taxol, see for example US 5.641.803; US 5.496.804; US 5.565.478).<br>
In order to be able to use the epothilones on a larger scale for pharmaceutical purposes, however, it is necessary to obtain appropriate amounts of these compounds.<br><br>
Until now, the extraction of natural substances by means of myxobacteria, especially the epothilones from the cell strain Sorangium Cellulosum SoceOO (deposited under no. 6773 at the German Collection of Microorganisms, see WO 93/10121) was described in literature. In order to obtain a satisfactory concentration of the natural substances, especially the epothilones, in the culture medium for the subsequent extraction, previously an adsorbate resin based on polystyrene was always added, for example Amberlite XAD-1180 (Rohm &amp; Haas, Frankfurt, Germany).<br>
However, the disadvantage of this process is that, on a large scale, it leads to an abundance of problems. Valves are impaired by the globules of resin, pipes can block, and apparatus may be subject to greater wear due to mechanical friction. The globules of resin are porous and therefore have a large inner surface area (about 825 m2/gram resin). Sterilisation becomes a problem, as air enclosed in the resin is not autoclaved. Thus, the process cannot be practicably carried out on a large scale using resin addition.<br>
On the other hand, without adding resin globules, a satisfactory concentration of epothilones cannot be achieved in the culture medium.<br>
Surprisingly, the requirements for finding a way out of this dilemma have now been found, enabling a satisfactory concentration of natural substances to be obtained from microorganisms, in particular myxobacteria, which produce epothilones such as epothilone A or B, in particular a concentration of epothilones A and B, in the culture medium, without the addition of resins, and thus enabling production of these compounds, especially epothilones to be carried out on a technical and industrial scale without the above-mentioned disadvantages.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
One aspect of the invention relates to a process for concentrating epothilones, especially epithilone A and/or B, in particular epothilone B, in a culture medium, in order to produce these compounds on a biotechnological scale, the process comprising microorganisms which produce these compounds, especially myxobacteria (as producers of natural<br><br>
substances), whereby a complex-forming component which is soluble in the culture meaium is added to the medium.<br>
A further aspect relates to the corresponding culture medium, which comprises a corresponding complex-forming component and microorganisms, especially myxobacteria, in particular of the genus Sorangium, which are suitable for producing epothilones. especially epothilone A and/or B.<br>
A further aspect of the invention relates to a process for the production of epothilones, especially epothilone A and/or B, especially the two pure compounds, in particular epothilone B, which is characterised in that the epothilones are obtained by working up a culture medium for the biotechnological preparation of these compounds, which comprises as producers of natural substances microorganisms, especially myxobacteria, that produce these compounds, and to which a complex-forming component that is soluble in the culture medium is added, and the subsequent purification and, if desired, separation of the epothilones, for example epothilone A and B.<br>
A fourth aspect of the invention relates to a method of separating epothilones, especially epothilones A and B from one another, which is characterised by chromatography on a reversed-phase column with an eluant comprising a lower alkyl cyanide.<br>
A further aspect of the invention relates to a strain of Sorangium cellulosum obtained by mutagenesis, which under othen/vise identical conditions, produces more epothilones than Sorangium cellulosum SoceQO.<br>
A further aspect also relates to new crystal forms of epothilone B.<br>

The prefix "lower" always indicates that the con2spondlngly name d radical contains up to a maximum of 7 carbon atoms, in particular up to 4 carbon atoms, and is branched or unbranched. Lower alkyl may be for example unbranched or branched once or more, and is e.g. methyl, ethyl, propyl such as isopropyl or n-propyl, butyl such as isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert.-butyl or n-butyl, or also pentyl such as amyl or n-pentyl.<br>
A culture medium for the biotechnological preparation of epothilones which contains microorganisms that produce these compounds, especially myxobacteria, as producers of natural substances, is primarily a medium which comprises a corresponding (naturally occurring or also obtainable by cultivation or in particular by genetic modification) microorganism, especially a myxobacterial strain which is in a position to produce these compounds, in particular a myxobacterium of the genus Sorangium, preferably (in particular for epothilone production) a microorganism of the type Sorangium Cellulosum Soce90 (see WO 93/10121), or a biomateriai derived therefrom (for example by mutagenesis or recombinant gene technology) or from parts of this myxobacterium, especially a conrespondingty derived strain, in particular the strain having the reference BCE33/10 or mutants thereof, and in addition, together with water, preferably other conventional and appropriate constituents of culture media, such as biopolymers, sugar, amino adds, salts, nucleic adds, vitamins, antibiotics, semiochemicals, growtii media, extracts from biomateriais such as yeast or other cell extracts, soy meal, starch such as potato starch and/or trace elements, for example iron ions in compiex"bound form, or suitable combinations of all or some of these constituents and/or also analogous additions. The con'esponding culture media are known tothe person skilled in the art or may be produced by known processes (see e.g. the culture mecBa inthe examples of the present disdosure, or in WO 93/10121). One preferred myxobacterium is a strain selected by UV mutagenesis and selection for increased fonnation of epothillone A and/or B over Sorangium ceButosum SoceOO, which is deposited in the DSM under no. 6773, espedaitythe nmitant BCE33/10, which was deposited underthe number DSM 11999 on 9th February 1998 at the Gemnan Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorgaoiismen und Zeiikulturen GmbH (DSMZ), Mascheroder Weg lb, D-38124 Braunsd)wetg, Gemiany).<br>
Strain culture and morphological description of strain BCE 33/10: The strain can grow on cellulose as the sole source of carbon and energy with potas2m nitrate asthe sole source of nitrogen, e.g. on fitter paper over ST21 mineral salt agar (0.1 % KNO2 0.1 % MgS04 x 7<br><br>

A water-soluble complex-forming component is primarily a water-soluble oligo- or polypeptide derivative or in particular an oligo- or polysaccharide derivative of cyclic or helical structure, which forms an intramolecular cavity, which because of its sufficiently hydrophobic properties is in a position to bind epothilones, especially epothilone A and/or epothilone B. A water-soluble complex-forming component that is especially preferred is one that is selected from cyclodextrins or (in particular) cyclodextrin derivatives, or mixtures thereof.<br>

Loftsson and M.E. Brewster (1996): Phannaceutical Applications of Cyclodextrins: Drug Solubilization and Stabilisation: Joumal of Pharmaceutical Science 85 (10):1017-1025; R.A. Rajewski and V.J. Stella(1996): Pharmaceutical Applications of Cyclodextrins: In Vivo Dnjg Delivery: Joumal of Pharmaceutical Science 85 (11): 1142-1169).<br><br>
In the following description of the working up and purification, epothilone is understood to be an epothilone which is obtainable from the corresponding microorganism, preferably epothilone C, D, E, F or especially A or in particular epothilone B. If not othenwise stated, where "epothilones" are mentioned, this is intended to be a general term which includes individual epothilones or mixtures.<br>
Working up of the epothilones is effected by conventional methods; first of all, by separating a culture into the liquid phase (centrifugate or filtrate) and solid phase (cells) by means of filtration or centrifugation (tubular centrifuge or separator). The (main) part of the epothilones found in the centrifugate or in the filtrate is then directly mixed with a synthetic resin, for example a resin based on polystyrene as matrix (hereinafter referred to also simply as polystyrene resin), such as Amberlite XAD-16 [Rohm &amp; Haas Germany GmbH, Frankfurt] or Diaion HP-20 [Resindion S.R.L., Mitsubishi Chemical Co., Milan] (preferably in a ratio of centrifugate: resin volume of ca. 10:1 to 100:1, preferably about 50:1). After a period of contact of preferably 0.25 to 50 hours, especially 0.8 to 22 hours, the resin is separated, for example by filtration or centrifugation. If required, after adsorption, the resin is washed with a strongly polar solvent, preferably with water. Desorption of the epothilones is then effected with an appropriate solvent, especially with an alcohol, in particular isopropanol. The solvent phase, especially isopropanol phase, is then removed from the solvent, preferably by means of prior, simultaneous or subsequent addition of water, in particular in a circulating evaporator, thereby being concentrated if necessary, and the resulting water phase is extracted with a solvent suitable for fomiing a second phase, such as an ester, for example a lower alkanol lower alkanoate, typically ethyl acetate or isopropyl acetate. The epothilones are thereby transferred into the organic phase. Then the organic phase is concentrated to the extent necessary, preferably to dryness, for example using a rotary evaporator.<br>
Subsequently, further processing takes place using the following steps, whereby the purification step by means of reversed-phase chromatography with elution with a nitnle is an inventive step and is thus compulsory, while the other steps are optional:<br>
-molecular filtration (gel chromatography), e.g. on a column of material such as Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) with an alcohol such as methanol as eluant;<br><br>
-separation of the epothilones by reversed-phase chromatography after Deing taKen up in a suitable solvent, and elution with a mixture of nitrile/water (compulsory), preferably characterised in that the chromatography is carried out on a column of material, especially a RP-18 material, which is charged with hydrocarbon chains, such as hydrocarbon chains containing 18 carbon atoms, and an eluant comprising a nitrile, especially a lower alkyl-nitrile, in particular acetonitrile, is used, in particular a mixture of nitrile/water is used, especially a mixture of acetonitrile/water, preferably in a ratio of nitrile to water of about 1:99 to 99:1, primarily between 1:9 and 9:1, e.g. between 2:8 and 7:3, e.g. 3:7 or 4:6. -single or multiple extraction of the residue (especially after evaporation) in a two-phase system consisting of water and a solvent immiscible with water, preferably an ester, in particular a lower alkyl lower alkanoate, such as ethyl acetate or Isopropyl acetate; ■adsorption chromatography, in particular by adding to a column of silica gel and eluting with an appropriate solvent or solvent mixture, especially a mixture of ester/hydrocarbon, for example lower alkyl alkanoate / C4-Cio-alkane, especially ethyl or isopropyl acetate / n-hexane, in which the ratio between the ester and hydrocarbon is preferably in the range 99:1 to 1:99, preferably 10:1 to 1:10, for example 4:1;<br>
-dissolving the residue, which may be obtained after concentration, in an appropriate solvent such as an alcohol, e.g. methanol; -mixing with activated carbon and removal thereof;<br>
-recrystallisation, e.g. from appropriate solvents or solvent mixtures, for example consisting of esters, ester/hydrocarbon mixtures or alcohols, especially ethyl or isopropyl acetate : toluene 1:10 to 10:1, preferably 2:3 (epothilone A) or methanol or ethyl acetate (epothilone B);<br>
whereby between each step being employed, the resulting solutions or suspensions are concentrated if necessary, and/or liquid and solid components are separated from one another, in particular by filtering or centrifuging solutions/suspensions. The more precise definitions mentioned below can be preferably used in the above individual steps.<br>
Working up and purification are preferably carried out as follows: After harvest, a culture is separated into the liquid phase (centrifugate) and solid phase (cells) by means of centrifugation (tubular centrifuge or separator). The main part of the epothilones are found in the centrifugate, which is then directly mixed with a polystyrene resin, such as Amberiite XAD-16 [Rohm &amp; Haas Germany GmbH, Frankfurt] or Diaion HP-20 [Resindion S.R.L.,<br><br>
Mitsubishi Chemical Co., Milan] (preferably in a ratio of centrifugate: resin volume of ca. 10:1 to 100:1, preferably about 50:1) and stirred in an agitator. In this step, the epothilones are transferred from the cyclodextrin to the resin. After a period of contact of ca. 1 hour, the resin is separated by centrifugation or filtration. Adsorption of the epothilones onto the resin may also be effected in a chromatography column, by placing the resin in the column and running the centrifugate over the resin. After adsorption, the resin is washed with water. Desorption of the epothilones from the resin is effected with isopropanol. The isopropanol phase is then freed of isopropanol preferably by the addition of water in particular in a circulating evaporator, and the resulting water phase is extracted with ethyl acetate. The epothilones are transferred from the water phase to the ethyl acetate phase. Then the ethyl acetate extract is concentrated to dryness, using a rotary evaporator. An initial concentration of the epothilones is then achieved by means of molecular filtration (e.g. Sephadex LH-20 [Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden] with methanol as eluant). The peak fractions from the molecular filtration contain epothilone A and B and have a total epothilone content of &gt; 10%. Separation of these peak fractions, which contain epothilone A and B in a mixture, into the individual components, then follows by means of chromatography on a "reversed-phase", e.g. RP-18 phase (phase which is modified by alkyl radicals containing 18 carbon atoms per chain), with an appropriate eluant, preferably one containing a nitrile such as acetonitrile (this gives better separation than for example alcohols such as methanol). Epothilone A elutes before epothilone B. The peak fractions with epothilone B may still contain small portions of epothilone A, which can be removed by further separation on RP-18. Finally, the epothilone A fraction is crystallised directly from ethyl acetate:toluene = 2:3. and the epothilone B fraction from methanol or ethyl acetate.<br>
Preferred embodiment of the invention<br>

A further preferred aspect of the invention relates to a method of separating epothilones, especially epothilones A and B from one another, which is characterised by chromatography on a reversed-phase column with an eluant containing a lower alkyl cyanide, chromatography being carried out on a column material, especially an RP-18 material, which is charged with hydrocarbon chains, such as those containing 18 carbon atoms, and employing an eluant containing a nitrile, especially a lower alkylnitrile , in particular acetonitrile, especially a mixture of nitrile/water, in particular a mixture of acetonitrile/water, preferably in a ratio of nitrile to water of ca. 1:99 to 99:1, primarily 1:9 to 9:1, e.g. between 2:8 and 7:3, e.g. 3:7 or 4:6. This separation may follow on to a filtration with a molecular sieve, or is preferably effected directly using the residue after adsorption of the epothilones from the culture medium containing a complex-forming component onto a resin.

b) comprises a step for separating the epothilones, especially epothilones A and B, from one another, which is characterised by chromatography on a reversed-phase column with an eluant containing a lower alkylcyanide, the chromatography being carried out on a column material, especially an RP-18 material, which is charged with hydrocarbon chains, such as those containing 18 carbon atoms, and employing an eluant containing a lower alkylnitrile, especially acetonitrile, in particular a mixture of lower alkylnitrile/water, preferably a mixture of acetonitrile/water, preferably in a ratio of lower alkylnitrile to water of ca. 1:99 to 99:1, primarily 1:9 to 9:1, e.g. between 2:8 and 7:3, e.g. 3:7 or 4:6, whereby if desired, it is possible to use further steps for working up and purification.<br>
The invention also relates in particular to a mutant derived from the strain Sorangium cellulosum Soce90, especially a strain of Sorangium cellulosum which is obtainable by mutagenesis, preferably by one or more UV-lnduced mutagenesis steps (in particular by UV radiation in the range 200 to 400, especially 250 to 300 nm) with subsequent searching in each step for mutants having increased epothilone production (in particular increased epothilone concentration in the culture medium), this strain under othenwise identical conditions producing more epothilones. in particular more epothilone A and/or B, especially epothilone B, than Sorangium cellulosum SoceQO, especially the Sorangium cellulosum strain BCE 33/10.<br>
The invention relates in particular to the individual process steps named in the examples or any combination thereof, the culture media named therein, crystal fomns and the strain described therein.<br><br>
The invention also relates to new crystal forms of epothilone B, especially a crystal form of epothilone B described as modification B and in particular described as modification A.<br>
The crystal forms can be distinguished in particular by their X-ray diagrams. X-ray diagrams taken with a diffractometer and using Cu-Kai-radiation are preferably used to characterise solids of organic compounds. X-ray diffraction diagrams are used particularly successfully tci determine the crystal modification of a substance. To characterise the existing crystal modification A and crystal modification B of epothilone B, the measurements are made at an angle range (29) of 2° and 35"2 with samples of substance that are kept at room temperature.<br>
The X-ray diffraction diagram thus determined (reflection lines and intensities of the most important lines) from crystal modification A (modification A) of epothilone B is characterised by the following table.<br><br><br><br>
The invention also relates in particular to a new crystal form of epothilones B, which is characterised by a melting point of more than 120 °C, especially between 120 °C and 128°C, in particular 124-125 °C. Surprisingly, this value is considerably higher than the values previously described in literature. The invention relates especially to a crystal form of epothilone B, which is characterised by the X-ray diffraction diagram of the crystal form A and a melting point of above 120°C, especially between 120°C and 128"2C, for example between 124 2C and 125 °C.<br>
The X-ray diffraction diagram thus detemiined (reflection lines and intensities of the most important lines) from crystal modification B (modification B) of epothilone B is characterised by the following table.<br><br><br><br>
The new crystal forms are especially stable, in particular crystal form A is to be regarded as the one which is more thermodynamically stable, and they are therefore suitable as active ingredients for solid forms of administration, for storing in solid fomi or as intemriediates (with particularly good storability) in the preparation of solid or liquid forms of administration.<br>
The invention also relates to the use of the new crystal fomis, especially crystal form B, but primarily crystal form A (all referred to hereinafter as active ingredient) in the production of pharmaceutical preparations, new pharmaceutical preparations which contain these new crystal forms, and/or their use in the treatment of proliferative diseases, such as tumours. In the following, where pharmaceutical preparations or compositions which comprise or 7 contain the active ingredient are mentioned, in the case of liquid compositions or compositions which no longer contain the crystal fomi as such, this is always understood to mean also the pharmaceutical preparations obtainable using the crystal forms (for example infusion solutions obtained using crystal forms A or B of epothilone B), even if they no longer contain the respective crystal fomi (for example because they exist in solution).<br>
The invention also relates especially to the use of a new crystal form of epothilone B, especially the crystal form B or in particular crystal fomi A, in the production of pharmaceutical preparations, characterised by mixing a new crystal fomi of epothilone B with one or more carriers.<br>
The invention also relates to a method of treating warm-blooded animals suffering from a proliferative disease, characterised by administering a dose of epothilone B which is effective for treating said disease in one or the new crystal forms to a wamn-blooded animal requiring such treatment, also including in particular the treatment with those preparations that are produced using one of the new crystal forms; and/or the use of a new crystal fomi of epothilone B in such a treatment.<br>
To produce the pharmaceutical preparations, the active ingredient may be used for example in such a way that the phannaceutical preparations contain an effective amount of the<br><br>
active ingredient together or in a mixture with a significant amount of one or more organic or inorganic, liquid or solid, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers.<br>
The invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition which is suitable for administration to a warm-blooded animal, especially humans, in the treatment of a proliferative disease, such as a tumour, the composition containing an amount of active ingredient that is suitable for treating said disease, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention are those intended for enteral, especially nasal, rectal or oral, or preferably parenteral, especially intramuscular or intravenous administration to warm-blooded animals, especially humans, and they contain an effective dose of the active ingredient on its own or together with a significant amount of 7 a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The dose of the active ingredient is dependent on the type of warm-blooded animal, the body weight, the age and the individual condition, individual pharmacokinetic situations, the disease to be treated and the type of administration.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions contain ca. 0.0001 % to ca. 95 %, preferably 0.001 % to 10 % or 20 % to ca. 90 % of active ingredient. Pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention may be present for example in unit dose forms, such as in the form of ampoules, vials, suppositories, drag2es, tablets or capsules.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention are produced by known processes, for example by conventional dissolving, lyophilising, mixing, granulating or manufacturing processes.<br>
Solutions of the active ingredient, also suspensions, and in particular aqueous solutions or suspensions, are preferably employed, whereby it is also possible, for example in the case of lyophilised compositions which contain the active ingredient on its own or together with a phamnaceuticaliy acceptable carrier, for example mannitol, for the solutions or suspensions to be prepared prior to administration. The pharmaceutical compositions may be sterilised and/or may contain excipients, for example preservatives, stabilisers, moisture-retaining agents and/or emulsion-fomiing agents, dissolving aids, salts for regulating osmotic<br><br>
pressure and/or buffers, and they are produced by known processes, tor example oy conventional dissolving or lyophilising processes. The solutions or suspensions mentioned may comprise viscosity-increasing substances, such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, dextran, polyvinylpyrrolidone or gelatin.<br>
Suspensions in oil contain as the oil component vegetable oils, synthetic oils or semisynthetic oils, which are customary for injection purposes. Notable examples are in particular liquid fatty acid esters, which contain as the acid component a long-chained fatty acid with 8 to 22, especially 12 to 22, carbon atoms, for example lauric acid, tridecylic acid, myristic acid, pentadecylic acid, palmitic acid, margaric acid, stearic acid, arachidic acid, behenic acid or corresponding unsaturated acids, for example oleic acid, elaidic acid, erucic acid, brassidic acid or linoleic acid, if desired with the addition of antioxidants, for example vitamin E, p-carotene or 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxytoluene. The alcoholic component of . these fatty acid esters preferably has a maximum of 6 carbon atoms and is a mono- or polyhydroxy alcohol, for example a mono-, di- ortri-hydroxy alcohol, for example methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol or pentanol, or an isomer thereof, but especially glycol and glycerol. The following examples of fatty acid esters may be mentioned in particular: propyl myristate, isopropyl palmitate, "Labrafil M 2375" (polyoxyethylene glycerol trioleate, Gattefosse, Paris), "Miglyol 812" (triglyceride of saturated fatty acids having a chain length of 8 to 12 carbon atoms, Huls AG, Germany), but in particular vegetable oils such as cottonseed oil, almond oil, olive oil, castor oil, sesame oil, soybean oil and in particular peanut oil.<br>
The injection or infusion preparations are produced according to customary methods under sterile conditions; the same applies also to the filling of the compositions into ampoules or vials and sealed containers.<br>
Preference is given to an infusion solution which contains the active ingredient and a phanDaceuticaily acceptable organic solvent.<br>
The phannaceutically acceptable organic solvents which may be used in a formulation according to the invention can be selected from all such solvents which are familiar to a person skilled in the art. The solvent is preferably selected from an alcohol, e.g. absolute ethanol, ethanol/water mixtures, preferably 70 % ethanol, polyethylene glycol 300,<br><br>
polyethylene glycol 400, polypropylene glycol and N-methylpyrrolidbne, especially<br>
polypropylene glycol or 70 % ethanol.	The active ingredient is present in the formulation in a concentration of 0.001 to 100 mg/ml, preferably from ca. 0.05 to 5 mg/ml, or from 5 to 50 mg/ml.<br>
Formulations of this type are easily stored as vials or ampoules. The vials or ampoules are typically made of glass, e.g. boron silicate. The vials or ampoules may be appropriate for any volume which is known from the prior art. They are preferably of sufficient size to be able to accept 0.5 to 5 ml of the formulation.<br>
Prior to administration, the formulations have to be diluted in an aqueous medium suitable for intravenous administration before the active ingredient can be administered to patients.<br>
It is preferable for the infusion solution to have the same or basically the same osmotic pressure as body fluids. Consequently, the aqueous medium contains an isotonic agent which has the effect of rendering the osmotic pressure of the infusion solution the same or basically the same as the osmotic pressure of body fluids.<br>
The isotonic agent can be selected from all agents that are familiar to a person skilled in the art, for example mannitol, dextrose, glucose and sodium chloride. The isotonic agent is preferably glucose or sodium chloride. The isotonic agents may be used in quantities which impart the same or basically the same osmotic pressure to the infusion solution as body fluids. The exact quantities required can be determined by routine experiments and depend on the composition of the infusion solution and the type of isotonic agent.<br>
The concentration of isotonizing agent in the aqueous medium depends on the type of each agent used. If glucose is used, it is preferably used in a concentration of 1 to 5% w/v, preferably 5% w/v. If the isotonizing agent is sodium chloride, it is preferably used in quantities of up to 1%, preferably ca. 0.9% w/v.<br>
The infusion solution can be diluted with the aqueous medium. The amount of aqueous medium used is chosen according to the desired concentration of active ingredient in the infusion solution. The infusion solution is preferably produced by mixing a vial or an<br><br>
ampoule containing the infusion concentrate (see above) with an aqueous medium, so that a volume of between 200 ml and 1000 ml is attained with the aqueous medium. Infusion solutions may contain other additives that are normally used in formulations for intravenous administration. These additives also include antioxidants.<br>
Antioxidants may be used to protect the active ingredient from degradation by oxidation. Antioxidants may be selected from those which are familiar to the person skilled in the art and which are suitable for intravenous formulations. The amount of antioxidant can be determined by routine experiments. As an alternative to adding an antioxidant, or additionally thereto, the antioxidant effect can be achieved by restricting the oxygen (air) contact with the infusion solution. This can be achieved in a simple way, by treating the vessel containing the infusion solution with an inert gas, e.g. nitrogen or argon.<br>
' Infusion solutions can be produced by mixing an ampoule or a vial with the aqueous medium, e.g. a 5% glucose solution in WFI in an appropriate container, e.g. an infusion bag or an infusion bottle.<br>
Containers for the infusion solutions may be selected from conventional containers that are non-reactive with the infusion solution. Among those suitable are glass containers, especially of boron silicate, but plastic containers such as plastic infusion bags, are preferred.<br>
Plastic containers may also be made of thermoplastic polymers. The plastic materials may also contain additives, e.g. softeners, fillers, antioxidants, antistatic agents or other customary additives.<br>
Suitable plastics for the present Invention should be resistant to elevated temperatures used for sterilisation. Preferred plastic infusion bags are the PVC materials which are known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
A large range of container sizes may be considered. When selecting the size of the container, the factors to be taken into consideration are especially the solubility of epothilones in an aqueous medium, easy handling, and if appropriate, storage of the<br><br>
container. It is preferable to use containers which hold between ca. 200 and 1000 ml of infusion solution.<br>
Owing to their good formulating properties, the new crystal forms of epothilone B according to the invention are especially suitable for the simple and reproducible production of the said infusion solutions. However, the new crystal forms are especially suitable for the production of pharmaceutical formulations which contain the active ingredient in solid form, for example oral formulations.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations for oral application may be obtained by combining the active ingredient with solid carriers, if desired by granulating the resultant mixture, and further . processing the mixture, if desired or if necessary, after adding suitable adjuvants, into tablets, dragee cores or capsules. It is also possible to embed them in plastic substrates which enable the active ingredient to be diffused or released in measured quantities.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutically employable carriers are especially fillers, such as lactose, saccharose, mannitol or sorbitol, cellulose preparations, and/or calcium phosphates, for example tricalcium phosphate or calcium hydrogen phosphate, and binders, such as starches, for example maize, wheat, rice or potato starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and/or polyvinyl pyrrolidone, and/or, if desired, disintegrators, such as the above-mentioned starches, crosslinked vinylpyrrolidones, agar, alginic acid or a salt thereof, such as sodium alginate. Adjuvants are in particular flow-improving agents and lubricants, e.g. silicates, talcum, stearic acid or salts thereof, such as magnesium or calcium stearate and/or polyethylene glycol. Drag§e cores are provided, if desired, with appropriate gastric-juice-resistant coatings, using inter alia concentrated sugar solutions, gum arable, talcum, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyethylene glycol and/or titanium dioxide, or coating solutions in suitable organic solvents, or in order to produce gastric-juice-resistant coatings, solutions of appropriate cellulose preparations, such as ethyl cellulose phthalate or hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose phthalate. Capsules are dry capsules consisting of gelatin or pectin, and if required, a softener such as glycerol or sorbitol. The dry capsules may contain the active ingredient in the fomri of granules, for example with fillers, such as lactose, binders, such as starches, and/or lubricants, such as talc or magnesium stearate, and where appropriate stabilisers. In soft capsules, the active ingredient may be present in dissolved or preferably<br><br>
suspended form, whereby oily adjuvants such as fat oils, paraffin oil or liquid propylene glycols are added; stabilisers and/or antibacterial additives may also be added. Dyes or pigments can be added to the tablets or dragde coatings, for example to improve identification or to distinguish different dosages of active ingredient.<br>
The usage in the treatment of a proliferative disease with one of the crystal forms B and in particular A preferably takes place whereby the crystal fonn (preferably as for the usage in the preparation of an infusion solution, as described above) is administered to a warmblooded animal, especially a human, in a dose which can be determined at between 20 and 133%, preferably between 25 and 100%, of the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) by standard methods, for example using a modified Fibronacci series, in which the increases in dosages for successive amounts are 100%, 67%, 50% and 40% followed by 33% for all subsequent doses; and, if necessary, one or more further doses administered in the dosage , range given above for the first dose, each dose after a period of time which allows sufficient recovery of the individual being treated after the preceding administration, in particular one week or more after the first administration, preferably 2 to 10 weeks, especially 3 to 6 weeks after each preceding administration. In general, this treatment scheme, in which a high dosage is administered once, twice or several times with sufficiently long intervals between the individual administrations for recovery to take place, is preferred over a more frequent treatment with lower doses, since hospitalisation is less frequent and for a shorter period and an improved anti-tumour effect can be expected. The dosage of epothilone B for humans is preferably between 0.1 and 50 mg/m2, preferably between 0.2 and 10 mg/m2.<br>
The following Examples serve to illustrate the invention without limiting its scope.<br>
Caution: When handling epothilones, appropriate protective measures must be taken, where necessary, in view of their high toxicity.<br>
The 750 litre femienter used in the following is a refined steel femienter from the company Alpha AG, Nidau, Switzerland.<br>
Example 1: Preparation of the strain BCE33/10 bv means of mutation and selection The strain employed is the mutant BCE33/10 (deposited at the Gemian Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures under number DSM11999 on 9th February 1998), which is<br><br>
derived from the strain Sorangium cellulosum Soce90 by mutation and selection as described below. In liquid media, the mutant BCE33/10 forms bacilli typical of Sorangia, with rounded ends and a length of 3-6 |xm, as well as a width of ca. 1 2m. Sorangium cellulosum Soce50 was obtained from the German Collection of Microorganisms under number DSM 6773.<br>
Preparation of the mutant BCE33/10 comprises three mutation steps with UV light and selections of individual colonies. The procedure in detail is carried out in accordance with the following operating steps<br>
Cultivation from the ampoule: The cells of the DSM6773 ampoule are transferred to 10 ml of G52 medium in a 50 ml Erienmeyer flask and incubated for 6 days in an agitator at 30°C and at 180 rpm. 5 ml of this culture are transferred to 50 ml of G52 medium(in a 200 ml Erienmeyer flask) and incubated at 180 rpm for 3 days in an agitator at 30°C.<br>
First UV mutation step and selection: Portions of 0.1 ml of the above culture are plated out onto several Petri dishes containing agar medium S42. The plates are then each exposed to UV light (maximum radiation range of 250 - 300 nm) for 90 or 120 seconds at 500 2iwatt per cm2. The plates are then incubated for 7-9 days at 30""C, until individual colonies of 1-2 mm are obtained. The cells of 100-150 colonies are then each plated out from an individual colony by means of plastic loop in sectors onto Petri dishes containing S42 agar (4 sectors per plate) and incubated for 7 days at 30"20. The cells that have grown on an area of ca. 1 cm2 agar are transferred by a plastic loop to 10 ml of G52 medium in a 50 ml Erienmeyer flask and incubated for 7 days at 180 rpm in an agitator at 30'C. 5 ml of this culture are transferred to 50 ml of G52 medium(in a 200 ml Erienmeyer flask) and incubated at 180 rpm for 3 days in an agitator at 30°C. 10 ml of this culture are transferred to 50 ml of 23B3 medium and incubated for 7 days at 180 rpm in an agitator at 30""C.<br>
To determine the amounts of epothilone A and epothilone B fomned in this culture, the following procedure is followed. The 50 ml culture solution is filtered through a nylon sieve (150 |xm pore size), and the polystyrene resin Amberl'ite XAD16 retained on the sieve is rinsed with a little water and subsequently added together with the filter to a 50 ml centrifuge tube (Falcon Labware, Becton Dickinson AG Immengasse 7, 4056 Basle). 10 ml<br><br>
of isopropanol (&gt;99%) are added to the tube with the filter. AftenA2ards, the well-sealed tube is shaken for 1 hour at 180 rpm in order dissolve the epothilone A and B, which is bonded to the resin, in the isopropanol. Subsequently, 1.5 ml of the liquid is centrifuged, and ca. 0.8 ml of the supernatant is added using a pipette to a HPLC tube. The HPLC analysis of these samples is effected as described below under HPLC analysis in the product analysis section. The HPLC analysis determines which culture contains the highest content of epothilone B. From the above-described sector plate of the corresponding colony (the plates have been stored at 4'"C in the meantime), cells from ca. 1 cm2 of agar area are transferred by a plastic loop to 10 ml of G52 medium in a 50 ml Erienmeyer flask and are incubated for 7 days at 180 rpm in an agitator at SO'2C. 5 ml of this culture are transferred to 50 ml of G52 medium (in a 200 ml Erienmeyer flask) and incubated at 180 rpm for 3 days in an agitator at 30°C.<br>
Second and third UV mutation step and selection: The procedure is exactly the same as described above for the first UV mutation step, whereby the selected culture of the best colony from the first UV mutation is used for the second mutagenesis. For the third mutagenesis, the culture of the best colony from the second mutagenesis is used accordingly. The best colony after this third cycle of UV mutation steps, followed by selection of the resulting strains for improved epothilone B production, corresponds to mutant BCE33/10,<br>
Preservation of the strain<br>
10 ml of a 3 day old culture in G52 medium (50 ml medium in a 200 ml Erienmeyer flask. 30°C and 180 rpm) are transferred to 50 ml of 23B3 medium (in a 200 ml Erienmeyer flask) and incubated for 3 days at 180 rpm in an agitator at SO2'C. 1 ml portions of this culture are removed In a form which is as homogeneous as possible (prior to each removal the culture is shaken by hand in the Erienmeyer flask) together with the polystyrene resin Amberlite XAD16 (polystyrene adsorption resin, Rohm &amp; Haas, Frankfurt, Germany), then filled into 1.8 ml Nunc cryotubes (A/S Nunc, DK 4000 Roslide, Denmark) and stored either at -70"20 or in liquid nitrogen.<br>
Cultivation of the strains from these ampoules is effected by heating them in the air to room temperature, and subsequently transferring the entire content of the cryo tube to 10 ml G52<br><br>
medium in an 50 ml Erienmeyer flask and incubating for 5-7 days at 180 rpm in an agitator at 30°C,<br>

Product analysis:<br>
Preparation of the sample:<br>
50 ml samples are mixed with 2 ml of polystyrene resin Amberlite XAD16 (Rohm + Haas, Frankfurt, Germany) and shaken at 180 ipm for one hour at 30°C. The resin is subsequently filtered using a 150 pm nylon sieve, washed with a little water and then added together with the filter to a 15 ml Nunc tube.<br>
Elution of the product from the resin:<br>
10 ml of isopropanol (&gt;99%) are added to the tube with the filter and the resin. Aftenwards, the sealed tube is shaken for 30 minutes at room temperature on a Rota-Mixer (Labinco BV, Netherlands). Then, 2 ml of the liquid are centrifuged off and the supernatant is added using a pipette to HPLC tubes.<br><br><br>
Example 2A: Effect of the addition of cyclodextrin and cyclodextrin derivatives to the epothilone concentrations attained.<br>
All the cyclodextrin derivatives tested here come from the company Fluka, Buchs, CH. The tests are carried out in 200 ml agitating flasks with 50 ml culture volume. As controls, flasks with adsorber resin Amberlite XAD-16 (Rohm &amp; Haas, Frankfurt, Germany) and without any adsorber addition are used. After incubation for 5 days, the following epothilone titres can be determined by HPLC:<br><br><br><br>
Apart from Amberlite (%v/v), all percentages are by weight (%w/v).<br>
Few of the cyclodextrins tested (2,6-di-o-methyl-p-cyclodextrin, methyl-p-cyclodextrin) display no effect or a negative effect on epothilone production at the concentrations used. 1-2% 2-hydroxy-propyl-p-cyclodextrin and p-cyclodextrin increase epothilone production in the examples by 6 to 8 times compared with production using no cyclodextrins.<br>
Example 2B: 10 litre femnentation with 1% 2-(hvdroxvproDvn-p-cvclodcxtrin);<br>
Femnentation is carried out in a 15 litre glass femnenter. The medium contains 10 g/l of 2-(hydroxypropyl)-p-cyclodextrin from Wacker Chemie, Munich, Gemiany. The progress of<br><br>
fermentation is illustrated in Table 2. Fermentation is ended after 6 days and working up takes place.<br><br>
Example 2C: 100 litre femnentation with 1% 2-(hiydroxypropyl)-p-cyclodextrln):<br>

' Example 3: Working up of the epothilones: Isolation from a 500 litre main culture: The volume of harvest from the 500 litre main culture of example 2D is 450 litres and is separated using a Westfalia clarifying separator Type SA-20-06 (rpm = 6500) into the liquid phase (centrifugate + rinsing water 2 650 litres) and solid phase (cells = ca. 15 kg). The main part of the epothilones are found in the centrifugate, The centrifuged cell pulp contains 
 <br>
the insoluble portions filtered off using a folded filter, and the solution added to a 10 kg Sephadex LH 20 column (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) (column diameter 20 cm, filling level ca. 1.2 m). Elution is effected with methanol as eluant. Epothilone A and B is present predominantly in fractions 21-23 (at a fraction size of 1 litre). These fractions are concentrated to dryness in a vacuum on a rotary evaporator (total weight 9.0 g). These Sephadex peak fractions (9.0 g) are thereafter dissolved in 92 ml of aceto-nitrile:-water:-methylene chloride = 50:40:2, the solution filtered through a folded filter and added to a RP column (equipment Prepbar 200, Merck; 2.0 kg LiChrospher RP-18 Merck, grain size 12ixm, column diameter 10 cm, filling level 42 cm; Merck, Darmstadt, Gemiany). Elution is effected with acetonitrile:water = 3:7 (flow rate = 500 ml/min.; retention time of epothilone A = ca. 51-59 mins.; retention time of epothilone B = ca, 60-69 mins.). Fractionation is monitored with a UV detector at 250 nm. The fractions are concentrated to dryness under vacuum on a Buchi-Rotavapor rotary evaporator. The weight of the r epothilone A peak fraction is 700 mg, and according to HPLC (external standard) it has a content of 75.1%. That of the epothilone B peak fraction is 1980 mg, and the content according to HPLC (extemal standard) is 86.6%. Finally, the epothilone A fraction (700 mg) is crystallised from 5 ml of ethyl acetate:toluene = 2:3, and yields 170 mg of epothilone A pure crystallisate [content according to HLPC (% of area) = 94.3%]. Crystallisation of the epothilone B fraction (1980 mg) is effected from 18 ml of methanol and yields 1440 mg of epothilone B pure crystallisate [content according to HPLC (% of area) = 99.2%]. m.p. (Epothilone B): e.g. 124-125 2'C; 2H-NMR data for Epothilone B: 500 MHZ"NMR, solvent: DMS0-d6. Chemical displacement 5 in ppm relative to TMS. s = singlet; d = doublet; m = multiplet<br><br><br><br>
