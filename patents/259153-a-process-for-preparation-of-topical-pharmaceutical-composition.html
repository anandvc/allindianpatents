(a) NAME: CIPLA LTD.<br>

3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION:<br>
The following specification describes the invention.<br><br>
Related Application:<br>
This application claims priority from our earlier Indian Patent Application No. 2447/MUM/2007 filed on 13/12/2007.<br>
Technical field:<br>
The present invention relates to a topical formulation with novel combination, in particular, for prophylaxis and/or treatment of an associated infection and/or disease and a method of manufacturing thereof.<br>
Background and Prior art:<br>
Sexually transmitted infections (STIs), referring to infections that are most often transmitted by direct sexual contact, remain an increasingly serious worldwide public health problem. These STIs, particularly viral infections, present a public health crisis.<br>
Women are especially at risk as they are more susceptible to infection, many STIs are asymptomatic and there is a high morbidity rate associated with untreated infections.<br>
Since its recognition in 1981, the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has become a catastrophic pandemic. The AIDS pandemic is a premiere public health concern. Individuals who are at high risk of HIV/AIDS infection are also at risk of infection by other sexually transmitted pathogens. Similarly, individuals at risk for non-HIV/AIDS sexually transmitted pathogens are also at high risk for HIV/AIDS infection. Additionally, it is significant to note that women comprise the most rapidly increasing population of the AIDS epidemic. Sexual transmission of HIV/AIDS in women occurs by infected semen being placed into the vagina, rectum, or other orifice. Currently, the only prevention strategy available for HIV/AIDS prevention is the condom or abstinence.<br>
Clinical pathologies attributable to STIs are profound. STIs cause acute and chronic infections, infertility, and in some cases cancer. Vaccines, which are costly and time-consuming to develop, are unavailable for STI/AIDS prevention. HIV/AIDS treatment employs therapeutic strategies, such as retrovirus triple therapy (e.g., AZT, DDI, etc.) to lower virus burden. However, the high expense of treatment renders this therapeutic<br><br><br>
option practically unavailable to populations in developing countries where HIV/AIDS is most prevalent. Indeed, the sum of all available STI/A1DS therapeutics is effective against only a limited number of susceptible pathogens. Furthermore, this limited therapeutic arsenal is largely confined to proprietary formulations, which are costly for the afflicted to procure.<br>
Common vaginal infections also pose an increasingly serious worldwide public health problem and can increase the risk of acquiring HIV/AIDS and other STIs. Vaginal candidiasis is the most common form of vaginitis, occurring more frequently than trichophyton, chlamydia, gonorrhea, or other bacterial infections. It is estimated that 75% of women will experience at least one episode of vulvovaginal candidiasis in their lifetime. 40 to 50% will experience a second episode in their life time. A much smaller (probably less than 5%), but still significant, number of women will suffer from repeated, often intractable attacks. Candidiasis is known to increase the risk of HIV/AIDS acquisition. Bacterial vaginosis (BV), previously known as nonspecific vaginitis or Gardnerella vaginitis is the most common cause of vaginal discharge. It may be the cause of up to 50%o of cases of vaginitis in all women and from 10-30%o in pregnant women. BV is not a sexually transmitted disease although it is sometimes listed as one. However, the risk of contracting the disease increases with multiple sex partners. Although treatment is available for these diseases, methods to prevent them and improved methods of treatment are still needed.<br>
Presently marketed vaginal contraceptive compositions, often containing nonoxynol-9 as an active ingredient, are generally known in the art. While presently marketed vaginal contraceptive formulations aid in preventing pregnancy, their ability to effectively prevent STIs, particularly HIV/AIDS as well as oral, rectal and vaginal infections, is very limited. Nonoxynol-9 and other detergents as well as their compositions can destroy the natural and safe ecology of the vagina, such as by inactivating lactobacillus bacteria. Further, spermicides may cause vaginal irritation, particularly with frequent exposure or higher doses. Recent analyses show that nonoxynol-9, when used frequently by women at high risk, may increase the risk of HIV infection (WHO 2002, WHO/CONRAD technical consultation on nonoxynol-9, Geneva).<br>

Many antiviral agents have been developed for the treatment of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. However, only temporary and limited benefits are observed in HIV-infected patients treated with any of the actual anti-retrovirals or combinations of them. The limited ability of these agents to decrease viral burden, the rapid development of resistance and the toxic side-effects of most drugs have limited their long-term efficacy. One major problem associated with the administration of antiviral agents to patients is their poor ability to penetrate and target infected cells. Rapid drug clearance and the toxicity of parent compounds or metabolites constitute also some of the major drawbacks which may slow down the development and use of many antiviral agents. Given the severe toxicity of antiviral agents actually available to treat AIDS and other viral diseases and their limited ability to target infected cells, strategies aimed at reaching therapeutic levels of drugs into infected cells and reducing toxicity should be explored.<br>

Detailed Description:<br>
The inventors have surprisingly found that by incorporation of liposome en-capsulated tenofovir in a suitable topical formulation (e.g. gel composition or spray foam) prevented the transmission of infectious pathogens and its permeation through the membrane of mucosa by means of physical cum pharmacological barrier thereby preventing infection of host cells.<br>
It was further found that by topical application of combination of anti-infectives like ciclopirox and/or tenofovir resulted better penetration in the fungal and vaginal infections,<br><br><br>
thereby destroying plasma membrane which inturn prevented or limited contact of the fungus and/or virus or its carrier cells with the epithelium or prevented or hindered its entry into the orifice by forming a physical cum pharmacological barrier and thus preventing recurrence of infection for a considerable period of time.<br>
Liposomes are microscopic vesicles in which a variety of drugs can be incorporated, to form a non-toxic and biodegradable formulation because of the similarity of the primary components of liposomes with natural membranes. It allows high cellular penetration, efficient targeting of macrophage-rich tissues and a marked improvement in drug pharmacokinetics.<br>
The liposomal topical formulation, according to the present invention, provides improved delivery of active agents to the infected cells and also reduces the toxic effects associated with their administration which inturn improved efficacy and safety of the drug used for the treatment of sexually transmitted infections including HIV/AIDS and/or related vaginal infections.<br>
When applied locally to mucosa or skin, liposomes are usually taken up by monocytes and macrophages and also by Langerhans cells which may capture and harbor HIV. Consequently, in contrast with free drugs, which tend to diffuse rapidly through the mucosa and reach the circulation, the use of drugs within liposomes and incorporated into a topical formulation (e.g. gel formulation or spray foam) concentrates the active agents within infected cells as well as within cells susceptible to HIV infection.<br>
It will be well acknowledged to a person skilled in the art that combination of anti-mycotic (e.g. ciclopirox) with liposome encapsulated tenofovir when applied topically; may achieve the same benefits as described above.<br>
According to preferred embodiment, topical combination comprising ciclopirox and tenofovir (or liposome encapsulated tenofovir) exhibited excellent anti-infective activity against opportunistic infections encountered in STI's and/or AIDS, such as vaginal infections without compromising on the stability and/or therapeutic efficacy of the formulation.<br><br><br>
According to the present invention, the protection from sexually transmitted infections, such as HIV/AIDS, and common vaginal infections, such as bacterial vaginosis and vaginal candidiasis, may be obtained by application of the novel pharmaceutical composition to vagina, rectum or other orifice.<br>
According to the present invention, pharmaceutical compositions may be used alone or in conjunction with delivery and/or contraceptive devices or methods, such as mechanical barrier-type devices.
