				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
TINTED POLYESTER RESIN COMPOSITION AND SHAPED ARTICLE THEREOF<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a tinted polyester resin composition and a shaped article made thereof. More particularly, the present invention relates to a polyester resin composition, containing cobalt metal element in an extremely small amount, tinted to a desired color tone and having an excellent formability and a shaped article thereof. BACKGROUND ART<br>
It is well known that polyester resins, particularly polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene naphthalate, polytrimethylene terephthalate and polytetramethylene terephthalate resins have excellent mechanical, physical and chemical performances and, therefore, are widely utilized for fibers, films and other shaped articles.<br>
Among these polyesters, polyethylene terephthalate resin is usually produced by a two step process.  Namely, in the first step, an ethylene glycol ester of terephthalic acid and/or a polymer with a low degree of polymerization produced by a method in which terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol are directly subjected to a esterification reaction; or a method in which a lower alkyl ester of terephthalic acid, for example, dimethyl terephthalate, and ethylene glycol are subjected to a transesterification reaction, or a method in which terephthalic acid and ethylene oxide are reacted with each other; and then in a second step, the reaction product of the first step is subjected to a polycondensation reaction in the presence of a polymerization catalyst, while heating the reaction mixture under a reduced pressure with the polymerization degree of the resultant product reached a desired level,<br><br>
to produce the target polyethylene terephthalate.<br>
It is well known that, in the polyester resin produced by the above-mentioned process, the reaction rate and the quality of the resultant polyester resin greatly depend on the type of the catalyst used in the polycondensation step.  With respect to the above-mentioned dependency, it is also known from the previous research results that when a catalyst comprising an antimony compound or a germanium compound which has been widely used as a polycondensation catalyst, is used, the polycondensation can be carried out at an excellent efficiency and the resultant polyester resin exhibits a good color tone.<br>
However, when continuous melt spinning of a polyester produced by using an antimony compound as a polycondensation catalyst is carried out over a long period of time, there arises the problems that foreign matter adheres and is deposited around a spinneret for melt spinning.  This foreign matter may be referred to as spinneret foreign matter hereinafter.  The deposited foreign matter causes a bending phenomenon of the molten polyester streams extruded from the spinneret, which<br>
another problems, that the resultant polyester resin is colored yellowish and exhibits an insufficient thermal stability of the polyester melt, occur.<br>
For example, Japanese Examined Patent Publications No. 48-2229 (Patent Reference 1) and No. 47-26597 (Patent Reference 2) disclose that, as titanium compounds other<br>
than those mentioned above, titanium hydroxide or a-titanic acid is used as a catalyst for the production of polyesters.  However, when titanium hydroxide is used, it<br>
is not easy to pulverize titanium hydroxide, and when a-<br>
titanic acid is used, ct-titanic acid has a low stability of the chemical structure thereof and, thus, is difficult to preserve and handle.  Therefore, these titanium components are not appropriate to use for industrial practice, and hardly produce a polyester polymer having a good color (b value).<br>
To solve the above-mentioned problems, there have been attempted to use a product obtained by a reaction of a titanium compound with a specific phosphorus compound as disclosed in WO 01/00706 (Patent Reference 3) and WO 03/008479 (Patent Reference 4), and a non-reacted mixture or a reaction compound of a titanium component with a specific phosphorus compound as disclosed in WO 03/027166 (Patent Reference 5), as a catalyst for the production of the polyester polymer.  It is true that the above-mentioned catalysts contribute to enhancing the thermal stability of the polyester melt and to improving the color of the resultant polymer.  However, these catalyst cause the reaction rate in the production of the polyester to be low, and thus a problem, that the productivity of the polyester is somewhat low, occurs.<br>
For the purpose of enhancing the stable formability of the polyester the method in which no antimony is used is an effective means.  However, the no-antimony method causes the color of the resultant polymer and polymer products to be unsatisfactory and thus has not been<br>
utilized in practice. Therefore, a polyester produced by using a catalyst containing no antimony and having a good color is required.<br>
In the production of the above-mentioned polyester, usually, the polymerization temperature must be controlled to approximately from 280 to 300°C.  However, it is known that this high polymerization temperature causes a problem that the resultant polymer is discolored due to thermal decomposition of the polymer, namely, the polyester per se is colored yellow.<br>
For the purpose of solving the yellow-coloring problem as mentioned above, usually, a cobalt compound is mixed into the polyester polymer to decrease the yellow-coloring, as disclosed in, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 51-128397 (Patent Reference 6).  The addition of the cobalt compound can certainly improve the color (b value) of the polyester polymer.  However, the addition of the cobalt compound causes a plurality of problems in that, regarding the thermal stability of the melt of the polyester polymer, the added cobalt compound deposits in the polymer and causes foreign matter to be generated, and the processability of the polyester polymer, to produce a desired shaped article, and the quality of the resultant shaped article are probably affected.  Further, in the case where a manganese compound is used as a catalyst for the transesterification reaction, and a cobalt compound is added, as a tinting agent, into the reaction mixture, the resultant polyester polymer has the problems that the cloths and fibers made from the resultant polyester polymer may be discolored when treated with a bleaching agent.<br>
Also, as an attempt of improving the color of the polyester polymer, a polyethylene naphthalate resin knead-mixed with a dye is disclosed in, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 11-158257 (Patent Reference 7), Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
Publication No. 3-231918 (Patent Reference 8), Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 11-158257 (Patent Reference 9) and Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 11-158361 (Patent Reference 10). Reference List<br>

The polyester resin composition of the present invention comprises an aromatic polyester polymer and a tinting agent.<br>
The aromatic polyester polymer usable for the present invention is obtained by a polycondensation reaction of an aromatic dicarboxylic acid component with a glycol component.  The aromatic dicarboxylic acid component preferably comprises, as a principal component, for example, a member selected from terephthalic acid, naphthalene dicarboxylic acid and ester-forming derivatives of the acids (for example, di(lower alkyl) diesters, etc.).  The glycol component comprises, as a principal component, a member selected from, for example, ethylene glycol, trimethylene glycol and tetramethylene glycol.  The aromatic dicarboxylic acid component and the glycol component may comprise, in addition to the above-mentioned principal components, one or more copolymerization components selected from, for example, isophthalic acid, aliphatic dicarboxylic acids (for example, adipic acid, etc.), aromatic dihydroxyle compounds, (for example, bisphenol A, etc.) and hydroxycarboxylic acids (for example, hydroxybenzoic acid, etc.).<br>
The above-mentioned aromatic polyester polymer preferably comprises, as a principal constitutional component, at least one member selected from the group consisting of polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene naphthalate, polytrimethylene terephthalate, polytrimethylene naphthalate, polytetramethylene terephthalate and polytetramethylene naphthalates.  Among them, the polyethylene terephthalate is preferably<br>
contained as a principal constitutional component in the aromatic polyester polymer.  The term "a principal constitutional component" refers to a component in an amount corresponding to 80 molar% or more of the total amount of all the repeating units, of the aromatic polyester polymer.<br>
In the polyester resin composition of the present invention, the content of metal elements having a true specific gravity of 5.0 or more, based on the mass of the resin composition, is preferably controlled to a level of 10 ppm or less by mass.<br>
The metal elements having a true specific gravity of 5.0 or more are usually derived from metallic compounds contained in catalyst, metallic tinting agents, and delustering agents which are contained in the polyester polymer.  In concrete terms, the metal elements include antimony, germanium, manganese, cobalt, cerium, tin, zinc, lead, and cadmium.  However, the metal elements having a true specific gravity of 5.0 or more do not include titanium, aluminum, calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium.<br>
The influence of the metal elements on the polyester resin composition of the present invention varies in response to the type of the metal contained in the polyester resin composition.  For example, in the case where the content of antimony metal is more than 10 ppm by mass, foreign matter is generated in a melt-spinning procedure or a film-forming procedure and adhere around a spinning orifices or extruding dies so as to affect on the continuous formability over a long period.  In the case of germanium, the metal per se is expensive and a high content thereof causes the resultant polyester resin composition to have an increased price.  Also, in the case of lead or cadmium, the metal per se is poisonous and a high content of a poisonous metal in the polyester polymer is not preferable.  The content of the high specific gravity metal element in the polyester resin<br>
composition is preferably 0 to 7 ppm by mass, more preferably 0 to 5 ppm by mass.<br>
In the polyester resin composition of the present invention, the content of the cobalt compound, in terms of cobalt metal element, is preferably controlled to 10 ppm by mass or less, more preferably 0 to 7 ppm by mass, on the basis of the mass of the polyester resin composition.  The cobalt compound contributes to improving the color of the polyester resin.  However, in the case where the content of the cobalt metal element exceeds 10 ppm by mass, the resultant polyester resin composition may exhibit insufficient heat resistance and melt stability and thus may be thermally decomposed in the melt spinning.  The thermal decomposition product of the cobalt compound may cause the resultant polyester resin composition and the shaped article from the resin composition to exhibit degraded qualities.<br>
The polyester resin composition of the present invention contains the tinting agent in an amount of 0.1 to 10 ppm by mass on the basis of the mass of the polyester resin composition.  The tinting agent usable for the polyester resin composition of the present invention includes organic polycyclic aromatic dyes, organic solvent-soluble coloring matters for example, oil-soluble dyes, and pigments.  In concrete terms, the tinting agent for the present invention include blue color-tinting coloring matters, violet color-tinting coloring matters, red color-tinting coloring matters, and orange color-tinting coloring matters which will be explained hereinafter.  These coloring matters for tinting may be used alone or in a mixture of two or more thereof.<br>
Among them, the mixtures of two or more coloring matters for tinting is preferably utilized due to the fact that the coloring matter mixtures for tinting easily satisfy the requirements concerning the optical absorption spectra of the tinting agent.<br><br>
organic solvent-soluble coloring matters, particularly oil-soluble dyes are preferably used.  The blue tinting coloring matters include, for example, C.I. Solvent Blue 11, C.I. Solvent Blue 25, C.I. Solvent Blue 35, C.I. Solvent Blue 36, C.I. Solvent Blue 45 (Telasol Blue RLS), C,I. Solvent Blue 55, C.I. Solvent Blue 63, C.I. Solvent Blue 78, C.I. Solvent Blue 83, C.I. Solvent Blue 87 and C.I. Solvent Blue 94; the violet tinting coloring matters include, for example, C.I. Solvent Violet 8, C.I. Solvent Violet 13, C.I. Solvent Violet 14, C.I. Solvent Violet 21, C.I. Solvent Violet 27, C.I. Solvent Violet 28, and C.I. Solvent Violet 36; the red tinting coloring matters include, for example, C.I. Solvent Red 24, C.I. Solvent Red 25, C.I. Solvent Red 27, C.I. Solvent Red 30, C.I. Solvent Red 49, C.I. Solvent Red 52, C.I. Solvent Red 100, C.I. Solvent Red 109, C.I. Solvent Red 111, C.I. Solvent Red 121, C.I. Solvent Red 135, C.I. Solvent Red 168, and c.l. Solvent Red 179; and the orange color tinting coloring matters include, for example, C.I. Solvent Orange 60, etc.<br>
The tinting agent contained in the polyester resin composition of the present invention has a maximum absorption wavelength in the range of 540 to 600 nm in an absorption spectrum in the wavelength range of 380 to 780 nm determined in a chloroform solution of the tinting agent in a concentration of 20 mg/liter at an optical path having a length of 1 cm, and has ratios of optical absorbances A400, A500, A600 and A700 of visible light spectra at wavelength of 400 nm, 500 nm, 600 nm and 700 nm respectively to an optical absorbance A^ in the visible light spectrum at the maximum absorption wavelength, determined in the above-mentioned chloroform solution of the tinting agent at the optical path having a length of 1 cm, and satisfying the requirements (1) to (4):<br>
0.00 £ A^o/A^ ^0.20<br><br>
0.10  S ASOQ/A^ g  0.70	(2)<br>
0.55  S ASOO/A^ *   1.00	(3)<br>
0.00   g A^o/A™, £   0.05	(4)<br>
In the requirements (1) to (4), A400, A50or A600, and A700 respectively represent optical absorbances in the visible light absorption spectra at wavelength of 400 nm, 500 nm, 600 nm and 700 nm, and A^ represents an optical absorbance in the visible light absorption spectrum at a maximum absorption wavelength.<br>
The absorption spectrum refers to a spectrum measured by a usual spectrophotometer.  In the case where the maximum absorption wavelength in the absorption spectrum of the solution of the tinting agent contained in the polyester resin composition is less than 540 nm, the resultant polyester resin composition exhibits too deep a reddish color tone and thus is not preferable, and where the maximum absorption wavelength is more than 600 nm, the resultant polyester resin composition exhibits too deep a bluish color tone, and thus is not preferable.<br>
The maximum absorption wavelength is preferably in the range of from 545 to 595 nm, more preferably from 550 to 590 nm.<br>
In the case wherein the optical path having a length of 1 cm of the chloroform solution of the tinting agent usable for the polyester resin composition of the present invention in a concentration at 20 mg/liter, the ratios of the absorptions at the wavelengths as mentioned above to the absorption at the maximum absorption wavelength do not satisfy at least one of the above-mentioned requirements (1) to (4), the resultant polyester resin composition exhibit too deep tinted color tone.<br>
The values of A400/A1Mf A^/A^, A^/A^, and A^/A^ satisfying the requirements (1) to (4) are preferably in the range specified by the equations (6) to (9):<br>
0.00 S A^o/A^ * 0.15	(6)<br><br>
0.30 g A500/AMX £ 0.60	(7)<br>
0.60 £ A^o/A^ * 0.95         (8)<br>
0.00 £ A.oo/A^ H 0.03	(9)<br>
in which equations, A4CO, Asoof A600, and A700 are as defined above.<br>
In the polyester resin composition of the present invention, if the content of the above-mentioned tinting agent contained therein is less than 0.1 ppm by mass, the resultant polyester resin composition exhibits too deep a yellowish color tone.<br>
Also, if the tinting agent content is more than 10 ppm by mass, the resultant polyester resin composition exhibits a decreased lightness and an increased grayish color tone and thus is not preferable.<br>
The content of the tinting agent is preferably in the range of from 0.3 ppm by mass to 9 ppm by mass, more preferably from 0.5 ppm by mass to 8 ppm by mass.<br>
The apparent white color of the polyester resin composition of the present invention is controlled by the tinting agent.  Namely, preferably, in the L* a* b* color specification system, the polyester resin composition heat-treated at a temperature of 140°C for 2 hours to crystallize the resin, the a* value is in the range of from -9 to 0, and the color b* value is in the range of from »2 to +10.  The a* value and the b* value of the resin composition vary in response to the amount of the tinting agent.  If the a* value is less than -9, the resultant polyester resin composition exhibits too deep a greenish color tone, and if the a* value is more than 0, the resultant polyester resin composition exhibits too deep a reddish color tone, and thus is not preferable. Also, if the b* value is less than -2, the resultant polyester resin composition exhibits too deep a bluish color tone and if it is more than +10, the resultant polyester resin composition exhibits too deep a yellowish color tone, and thus is not preferable.

The present invention will be illustrated by the following examples which are not intended to restrict the scope of the present invention in any way.  In the examples, intrinsic viscosity, color, titanium content, the height of adhered accumulation layers generated around the spinning orifices, etc. were determined by the following measurements.<br>
(1)	Intrinsic viscosity<br>
Chips of a polyester resin composition were dissolved in ortho-chlorophenol by a dissolving operation at a temperature of 100°C for 60 minutes.  The intrinsic viscosity of the polyester resin composition was calculated from a viscosity value of the diluted solution measured at a temperature of 35°C by using the Ubbelohde viscometer.<br>
(2)	Content of diethvleneglvcol<br>
Chips of a polyester resin composition were decomposed with hydrazine hydrate, and the content of diethyleneglycol contained in the resultant decomposition product was determined by using a gas chromatography (model:  HP6850, made by Hewlett-Packard).<br>
(3)	Color (L* value, a* value and b* value)<br>
In the case of chips;<br>
The chips of polyester resin composition were melted at a temperature of 285°C under vacuum for 10 minutes and the resultant melt was formed, on an aluminum plate, into a plate having a thickness of 3.0 ± 1.0 nun, the resultant plate was rapidly cooled in ice water, and then the plate was subjected to a drying-crystallization treatment at 140°C for 2 hours.  Thereafter, the resultant plate was placed on a white standard plate for differential colorimeter adjustment, and then the L* value and b* value of the plate surface was measured in accordance with JIS Z 8729, by using a Hunter differential colorimeter (model:  CR-200) made by Minolta K.K.  The L* value represent a lightness of the color, and the larger the L* value, the higher the color lightness.  The b* value represents a degree of discoloration of the polyester resin composition with yellowish color, which degree increases with increase in the b* value. In the case of fibers;<br>
Four tabular knitted fabrics were prepared from the fibers, and superimposed on each other.  The L* value and the b* value of the superimposed fabrics were measured in the same manner as mentioned above.<br>
(4)	Qualitative analysis of metal components having a<br>
true specific gravity of 5.0 or more<br>
A sample of a polyester resin composition was mixed with ammonium sulfate, sulfuric acid, nitric acid and perchloric acid and subjected to a wet decomposition treatment at approximately 300°C for 9 hours.  The resultant decomposition liquid was diluted with water and then subjected to a qualitative analysis using a ICP<br>
emission analysis apparatus (JY170, ULTRACE) made by RIGAKU DENKIKOGYO K.K., to confirm whether or not the metal elements having a true specific gravity of 5.0 or more were contained in the sample.  With respect to the metal elements which were confirmed to be contained in contents of 1 ppm by mass or more, the contents of the metal elements were recorded.<br>
(5)  Contents of polyester-soluble titanium, aluminum, antimony, manganese, germanium, cobalt and phosphorus<br>
To determine the amounts of titanium element, aluminum element, antimony element, manganese element, germanium element, cobalt element and phosphorus element each soluble in a polyester contained in the polyester resin composition, a sample in the form of particles of the polyester resin composition was heat-melted on a steel plate and specimens having a flat smooth surface was formed from the melt by suing a compressive press. The specimens were supplied to a fluorescent X-ray tester (model:  ZSX lOOe, made by RIGAKU DENKIKOGYO K.K.), to determine the contents of the above-mentioned elements. In the case where the polyester resin composition contained titanium element derived from titanium dioxide added, as a delustering agent, to the polyester resin composition, a sample of the polyester resin composition was dissolved in ortho-chlorophenol, then an extraction treatment with a 0.5N hydrochloric acid was applied to the dissolved polyester resin composition, the resultant extraction liquid was subjected to a quantitative analysis using an electron spectrophotometer, model Z-8100, made by K.K. HITACHI SEISAKUSHO.  When a dispersion of titanium dioxide in the extraction liquid prepared by the 0.5N hydrochloric acid extraction was observed, the dispersed titanium dioxide particles were deposited by using a centrifugal separator, only the resultant clear supernatant liquid was recovered by an inclination method, the recovered liquid was subjected to the same measurement as mentioned above.  By these<br><br>
testing operations, even when the polyester resin composition contained titanium dioxide derived from the delustering agent, the content of the titanium element derived from the polyester-soluble titanium compounds can be quantitatively determined.<br>

The melt-spinning procedure was contained at a taking-up speed of 600 m/minute for two days, the height of adhered layers formed around the outside edges of the orifices of the melt-spinneret was measured.  The occurrences of bending of the filamentary streams of the extruded melt of the polyester resin component increases with increase in the height of the adhered layer.  Also, the greater the height of the adhered layer, the lower the formability of the polyester resin composition.  Namely, the height of the adhered layer generated on the melt-spinneret is an indicator of the formability of the polyester resin composition.<br>
(7)	Haze<br>
In the case of bottle preform;<br>
A testing sample was taken from a middle portion of a body portion of a preform in the longitudinal direction of the preform sampled from preforms produced after the first five shots in the injection molting procedure.  The haze of the taken portion of the preform sample was measured by a haze meter (model:  HDH-1001DP) made by NIHON DENSHOKUKOGYO K.K. In the case of film;<br>
A sheet of the polyester resin composition prepared by melt-extruding the resin composition onto a rotating cooling drum through a melt-extruder was rapidly cool-solidified to provide an undrawn film (sheet) having a<br>
thickness of 500 jam.  The haze of the film was measured<br><br>

distillation device.  The temperature of the content in the reaction vessel was increased to 300°C, to effect a polycondensation reaction under a high vacuum of 30 Pa or less.
