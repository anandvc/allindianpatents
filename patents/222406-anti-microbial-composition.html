				<td>ANTI-MTCROBIAL COMPOSITION<br>
This invention relates to anti-microbial compositions and to formulations<br>
including the anti-microbial compositions.<br>
Microorganisms can be found in many environments and are known to<br>
present health hazards due to infection or contamination.<br>
When microorganisms are present on the surface of a substrate they can<br>
replicate rapidly to form colonies. Virtually all microorganisms replicate in<br>
this way. The microbial colonies form a coating, which is known as a<br>
biofilm, on the substrate surface. Biofilms are more hazardous to health<br>
than individual microorganisms. Some microorganisms also produce<br>
polysaccharide coatings, which makes them more difficult to destroy.<br>
A biofilm can be formed by a single bacterial species but mere often<br>
biofilms consist of several species of bacteria, as well as fungi, algae,<br>
protozoa, debris and corrosion products. Essentially, biofilm may form on<br>
any surface exposed to bacteria and some amount of water, which is needed<br>
to allow metabolic processes.<br>
Biofilm formation occurs via three distinct stages. The three stages are (i)<br>
adhesion or attachment, (ii) proliferation and (iii) biofilm differentiation.<br>
Before stage (i) can occur, the microorganisms must be transported to a<br>
surface. This occurs by random contact with the surface due to Brownian<br>
motion, sedimentation, active transport or chemotaxis. Once the<br>
microorganisms have been transported to a surface, initial adhesion to the<br>
surface occurs, for example, as a result of Lifshitz-van der Waals forces,<br>
acid-base interactions and electrostatic forces between negatively charged<br>
microorganisms and positively charged domains.<br>
The microorganisms then excrete extracellular polymers, which form an<br>
extracellular polymeric substance composed of polysacchSlides., nucleic<br>
acids, amphiphilic, humic substances and proteins. The extracellular<br>
polymeric substance forms a matrix that interconnects and binds together<br>
microorganisms attached to the surrounding surface. Thus, the<br>
microorganisms are anchored to .the surface, which can be all kinds of<br>
materials such as metals, plastics, soil particles, medical implant materials<br>
and tissue.<br>
Once anchored to a surface, biofilm microorganisms carry out a variety of<br>
detrimental or beneficial reactions (by human standards), depending on the<br>
surrounding environmental conditions. It is, therefore, desirable to remove<br>
and/or destroy the biofilm microorganisms on the surface.<br>
The pasteurisation process has been used for a number of years to destroy<br>
microorganisms. In this process, the microorganisms are subjected to high<br>
temperature and, optionally, high pressure.<br>
Microorganisms can also be removed from surfaces by simple washing and<br>
sanitisation of the. surface with fresh water or with soap or simple<br>
detergents. Washing removes the majority of the microorganisms but does<br>
not prevent the growth of any microorganisms that remain.<br>
Microorganisms can also be destroyed by contacting them with antimicrobial<br>
agents, which are poisonous to microorganisms, A large number<br>
of anti-microbial agents are known. For example, bacteriocidal, fungicidal,<br>
algicida], yeasticidal and moldicidal agents are known. The anti-micxobial<br>
agents can destroy microorganisms that are present in a wide range of<br>
environments such as medical, industrial, commercial, domestic and marine<br>
environments. Many of the known anti-microbial agents have previously<br>
been included in compositions for use in various applications and<br>
environments.<br>
For example., EP-A-0233954 describes a composition for treating a solid<br>
material to give it anti-mi crobial, hydrophilic and anti-static properties. The<br>
composition comprises a quaternary ammonium salt-containing silane, an<br>
organopolysiloxane and, optionally, an organic solvent.<br>
EP-A-0206028 describes a method of promoting the growth of plants. The<br>
method comprises applying a specific quaternary ammonium compound,<br>
which may be formulated as an aqueous solution.<br>
EP-A-0181182 describes an emulsion that comprises water, a water<br>
immiscible liquid, a cationic silane and, optionally, a co-surfactant.<br>
WO-A-93/10209 describes a composition for sterilising, disinfecting,<br>
cleaning and lubricating medical and dental devices. The composition<br>
comprises a water-soluble or water-dispersible disinfecting and/or sterilising<br>
agent, a surfactant and a water-soluble polymer having lubricating<br>
characteristics.<br>
WO-A-92/21320 describes medicated shampoo compositions that include<br>
anti-microbial agents. The compositions include an anti-microbial agent<br>
comprising a fatty acid monoester of a polyhydroxyl alcohol, a chelating<br>
agent and a cleansing agent.<br>
US-A-5244666 describes a liquid preparation for use as a presurgical skin<br>
scrub or wound disinfectant. The preparation comprises a quaternary<br>
ammonium compound, a substituted phenolic compound, -water and sodium<br>
lauryl sulfate.<br>
JP-9175904 describes an agricultural composition that comprises 1,2-<br>
benzisothiazoline-3-on, dimethyl polysiloxane, water and N-t-butyl-N'-(4-<br>
ethy]benzoyl)-3,5-dimethylbenzohydrazide.<br>
The known anti-microbial agents and the compositions that contain these<br>
anti-microbial agents destroy microorganisms by a number of different<br>
mechanisms.<br>
Chlorinated compounds, such as hypochlorites (bleaches) can act as antimicrobial<br>
agents. Traditional bleach includes sodium hypochlorite. Sodium<br>
hypochlorite breaks down to provide chloride and chlorate. Chlorate is<br>
highly toxic to life forms.<br>
Although bleaches are useful for destroying a wide range of<br>
microorganisms, typically they only work for a short term. This is because<br>
their efficacy decreases rapidly once they have broken down. Thus,<br>
bleaches do not provide long-term passive anti-microbial control and<br>
sanitisation. By "passive control" we mean that the substrate counters<br>
microbial infection on its own by some property within it, so that it does not<br>
require a cleaning regime to be effective at controlling microorganisms.<br>
Furthermore, bleaches can decompose to produce chlorine gas, which is<br>
known to be harmful to the environment. Thus, the use of chlorinecontaining<br>
compounds is to be avoided where possible.<br>
Other known anti-microbial agents include phenol and compounds thereof,<br>
arsenene and salts of arsenic. Examples of useful phenol compounds<br>
include polychlorinated biphenols, such as triclosan. Other known antimicrobial<br>
agents that are commonly used include .organic and inorganic<br>
salts of heavy metals such as silver, copper or tin. For example, colloidal<br>
silver can be used.<br>
Phenol compounds typically are highly toxic to humans and animals as well<br>
as to microorganisms. Consequently the anti-microbial agents are<br>
dangerous to handle, and specialist handling, treatment and equipment are<br>
therefore required in order to -handle these anti-rnicrobial agents safely.<br>
Anti-microbial agents can also be difficult to handle if they are strongly<br>
acidic or alkaline. The manufacture and disposaj of compositions<br>
comprising this type of anti-microbial agent can, therefore, be problematic.<br>
There can also be problems associated with the use of compositions<br>
containing highly toxic anti-microbial agents, particularly in consumer<br>
materials where it is difficult to ensure that they are used for designated<br>
purposes.<br>
Herein, unless the context indicates otherwise, "toxicity" is intended to refer<br>
to toxicity to complex organisms such as mamroals. References to "toxic"<br>
are to be construed accordingly.<br>
Anti-microbial agents based on phenols and heavy metals typically are only<br>
effective against certain microorganisms, such as fungi. Their use is,<br>
therefore, limited because they are not effective against all types of<br>
microorganism. Additionally, some anti-microbial agents, such as biphenol,<br>
do not remain active for extended periods because they are volatile and do<br>
not remain on the surface to which they are applied.<br>
Once the anti-microbia] agents and/or their breakdown products enter the<br>
environment then they can affect the health of life forms that they were not<br>
intended to affect. Moreover, the anti-microbial agents and their breakdown<br>
products are often highly stable and can cause environmental problems for<br>
long periods of time. For example, the metal salts produce toxic rinsates.,<br>
which are poisonous to aquatic life. Once the toxic compounds enter the<br>
environment they are not easily broken down and can cause persistent<br>
problems or •unknown consequences. For example, colloidal silver, tributyl<br>
tin and diuron can remain in the environment for extended periods of time.<br>
The combustion of poly chlorinated biph en ol compounds produces dioxins,<br>
which are harmful to the environment.<br>
Other anti-microbial agents currently in use include antibiotic type<br>
compounds, such as penicillin. Antibiotics disrupt the biochemistry within<br>
microorganisms, for example by selectively diluting solutions to destroy or<br>
inhibit the growth of harmful microorganisms.<br>
Although antibiotics are effective, it is currently believed that they may<br>
selectively permit the development of resistant strains of the species that<br>
they are used against. These resistant strains are then able to reproduce<br>
unimpeded by the use of known antibiotics. Thus, there is a growing<br>
concern that wide and uncontrolled use of antibiotic materials in the wider<br>
environment, as opposed to their controlled use in medical contexts, could<br>
produce significant long-term risks. Antibiotics are, therefore, considered<br>
inappropriate for general use in a non-medica) environment.<br>
There is also a risk that resistant strains can occur with other types of antimicrobial<br>
agent, which can have a biochemical effect. For example,<br>
triclosan resistance is discussed in Chuanchuen et al., "Multidrug Efflux<br>
Pumps and Triclosan Resistance in Pseudomonas Aeruginosa", 100th<br>
General Meeting of the American Society for Microbiology, May 21-25,<br>
LA; Meade et al., "Unique Mechanism of Triclosan Resistance Identified in<br>
Environmental Isolates", 100* General Meeting of the American Society for<br>
Microbiology., May 21-25, LA; Suzangar et al.3 "An Evaluation of Biocidecontaining<br>
Materials for their Surface Colonisation-resistance and Other<br>
Properties", 100* General Meeting of the American Society for<br>
Microbiology, May 21-25, LA.<br>
Thus, there is a need for an anti-microbial composition that is effective<br>
against a wide variety of microorganisms for long periods of time and<br>
which can be used safely and conveniently.<br>
According to an aspect of the invention there is provided an anti-microbia]<br>
composition comprising (i) a first compound having a high surface tension<br>
of from 20 to 35 mN/m, (ii) a second compound having a low surface<br>
tension of from 8 to 14 mN/m, (iii) a first anti-microbial agent and (iv) a<br>
polar solvent, wherein the composition acts substantially to prevent the<br>
formation of microbial colonies on or at a surface of the composition.<br>
The anti-microbial composition of the invention is highly effective and<br>
works with a broad range of microorganisms.<br>
It seems that the anti-microbial composition of the invention works by<br>
providing a surface to which microorganisms are substantially prevented<br>
from adhering and attaching. In other words, the composition of the<br>
invention substantially prevents the occurrence of stage (i) of the biofilrn<br>
formation process. This means that the microorganisms cannot then<br>
multiply and form biofilms.<br>
It is thought that the surface provided by the anti-microbial composition<br>
prevents adhesion and attachment of microorganisms due to the interaction<br>
of two compounds of high and low surface tension, which have opposing<br>
surface tension effects.<br>
7<br>
The prevention of the formation of a biofilm and the greatly reduced and<br>
attenuated colonies of microorganisms provides a substantially reduced risk<br>
due to infection or contamination. This has the beneficial effect of<br>
sanitizing products that incorporate the anti-microbial composition.<br>
The anri-rnicrobial composition of the invention typically is also able to<br>
break down biofilms that have already formed. It seems that the<br>
composition of the invention achieves this by dispersing the biofilms and<br>
effectively spreading out the cell walls so as to cause them to break down.<br>
The composition may also cause thinning and distortion of the biofflm,<br>
which makes the biofilm more susceptible to the anti-microbial agents and,<br>
therefore, increases the effectiveness of the anti-microbial agents in the<br>
composition.<br>
As the anti-microbial composition of the invention physically disrupts the<br>
adhesion and attachment of a microorganism to a surface, which is a feature<br>
that is common to a wide range of microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi<br>
and moulds, the composition is effective against a broad range of<br>
microorganisms- Thus, an advantage of the anti-microbial composition of<br>
the invention is that it is able to prevent a broad range of microorganisms<br>
from adhering and attaching to the surface and, therefore, from forming a<br>
biofilm. Large numerous colonies are also substantially prevented from<br>
forming. Thus, the ability of the colony to grow is substantially reduced or<br>
even prevented. The anti-microbial composition of the invention is,<br>
therefore, general in its control of microorganisms.<br>
It seems that as well as preventing the growth of colonies, the anti-microbial<br>
composition of the invention increases the relative age of the colony<br>
because new microorganisms are prevented from being produced. Thus, the<br>
anti-microbial agents of the composition are brought into contact with<br>
"older" microorganisms that are more susceptible to anti-rnicrobial agents<br>
than, newer ones. The anti-microbial agents are, therefore, more effective at<br>
lower concentrations than those that are normally used. Thus, the<br>
composition of the invention increases the efficacy of, the anti-microbial<br>
action of the anti-microbial agents compared to when they are used alone.<br>
The anti-microbial composition of the invention can easily be incorporated<br>
into other materials., such as functional materials. "When incorporated into<br>
such materials, these become anti-microbial in nature and the surface of the<br>
formulation will be modified so as to substantially prevent the<br>
microorganisms from adhering and attaching thereto.<br>
Another advantage of the anti-microbial composition is that it need not<br>
comprise combinations of materials that are highly toxic to mammals. The<br>
anti-microbial agents used in the anti-microbial compositions are typically<br>
well known and widely understood and tested anti-microbial agents. The<br>
efficacy of the known anti-microbial agents is amplified in the compositions<br>
of the invention. Therefore, anti-microbial agents that have a low toxicity<br>
can be used in the anti-microbia] compositions. In contrast, new antimicrobial<br>
agents for known techniques of sanitization use '"stronger", more<br>
toxic and/or little tested materials.<br>
The anti-microbial composition of the invention also does not comprise<br>
materials that produce highly persistent residues or rinsates or products that<br>
contain heavy metals and their salts. Thus, there is a greatly reduced risk of<br>
long term hazards associated with the anti-microbial compositions.<br>
The composition of the invention does not interfere with the biochemical<br>
reproductive pathways of the microorganisms it controls. The risk of<br>
resistance build up and the development of resistant strains is, therefore,<br>
highly unlikely.<br>
The surface tension of the first compound is greater than that of the second<br>
compound and is preferably less than the surface tension of water at any<br>
specified temperature. Thus, the first compound can typically act to reduce<br>
the surface tension of water. The surface tension of the first compound is<br>
from 20 to 35 mN/m at 20°C.<br>
The surface tension of the second compound is from 8 to 14 mN/m at 20°C,<br>
more preferably 10 mN/m at 20°C. The low surface tension of the second<br>
compound reduces non-specific bonding with other components of the<br>
composition, particularly bonding with aqueous or hydrated materials.<br>
The first compound is preferably hydrophobia The second compound is<br>
preferably hydrophilic. This appears to provide a composition that is<br>
typically stable in both hydrophobic and hydropbjlic materials.<br>
Additionally, the hydrophobic first compound typically attracts the<br>
hydrophilic second compound, so as to provide the desired opposing surface<br>
tension effects. This combination of properties is thought to create a<br>
microscopic turbulent effect that is disruptive to the formation of a biofilm.<br>
The fact that this effect is microscopic means that it has a great efficacy on<br>
microorganisms but not on larger macroorganisms.<br>
Whilst it is preferred that the first compound is hydrophobic and the second<br>
compound is hydrophilic, it is possible for the first compound to be<br>
hydrophilic and the second compound to be hydrophobic.<br>
Preferably, the first compound is a second arrti-microbial agent. Thus, as<br>
well as contributing to the surface effects, the first compound also acts as an<br>
anti-microbial agent. However, the efficacy of the second anri-microbial<br>
10<br>
agent is improved by the inclusion of the other components of the<br>
composition.<br>
By the term "anti-microbial agent" we mean any chemical substance that<br>
can destroy microorganisms.<br>
The first and second anti-microbial agents (hereinafter referred to generally<br>
as the anti-microbial agents) present in the compositions of the invention are<br>
typically well known and have been subject to research by the regulatory<br>
authorities. The anti-microbial agents generally have some effect when they<br>
are used alone. However, the efficacy of the anti-microbial agents is<br>
amplified when they are used in combination with the other components of<br>
the compositions of the invention.<br>
Preferably, the composition of the invention comprises two or more antimicrobial<br>
agents. A typical composition insy comprise four anti-microbial<br>
agents.<br>
The anti-microbial agents are preferably of a polar nature. This-enables<br>
them to associate with the other components of the composition, for<br>
example by hydrogen bonding or non-chemical bonding. This association<br>
brings the anti-microbial agents into direct association with the<br>
microorganisms as the other components of the composition of the<br>
invention themselves associate with the microbial wall. Thus, the antimicrobial<br>
agents are effective at low concentrations. The anti-microbia]<br>
agents are not thought to form a chemical bond with the first and second<br>
compounds.<br>
Preferably, the composition comprises at least one anti-microbial agent<br>
selected from bacteriocidal,, fbngicidal, algicidal, yeasticidal and moldicidal<br>
11<br>
agents. More preferably, the composition comprises bacteriocidal,<br>
ftragicidal andmoldicidal agents.<br>
The first anti-microbial agent is preferably an amphoteric compound, an<br>
iodophore, a phenolic compound, a quaternary ammonium compound, a<br>
hypochlorite or a nitrogen based heterocyclic compound.<br>
The second anti-mi crobial agent is preferably a surfactant, more preferably<br>
a quaternary ammonium compound. Both the first and second antimicrobial<br>
agents may each comprise a quaternary ammonium compound.<br>
Preferably, the anti-mi crobial compositions of the invention comprise one<br>
or more quaternary ammonium compounds, phenolic compounds and<br>
nitrogen based heterocyclic compounds as the anti-mi crobial agent.<br>
Quaternary ammonium compounds that are suitable for use in the invention<br>
include compounds of formula R'R2RJRTOr., in which one or two of the R<br>
groups are alkyl, optionally substituted by aryl or optionally interrupted by<br>
aryl or a heteroatom, such as oxygen, and the other R groups are the same or<br>
different and are Cj to G
Preferred quaternary ammonium compounds include benzalkonium halides,<br>
aryl ring substituted benzalkonium halides, such as ethyl-substituted<br>
benzallconium halides, and twin chain quaternary ammonium compounds,<br>
such as di alky 1 dim ethyl ammonium compounds wherein the two nonmethyl<br>
alkyl groups are selected from medium and long chain alkyl groups,<br>

R , R , R ) contains a heteroatom include domiphen bromide, benzalkonium<br>
12<br>
chloride and methylbenzalTconrum chloride.<br>

composition include allcylpyridinium compounds, such as<br>
cetylpyridinium chloride, and bridged cyclic amino compounds such as the<br>
hexaminium compounds.<br>

berizyl-Cn-C^-alkyldimethyl-anirnoniuinchloride.<br>
Arnphoteric compounds suitable for use in the present invention include<br>
long chain N-alkyl derivatives of amino acids. Long chain N-alkyl<br>
derivatives of glycine, alanine and beta-amino butyric acid are preferred.<br>
Particularly preferred compounds include dodecyl beta-alanine, dodecyl<br>
beta-armnobutyric acid, dodecyiamino-di(aminoethylamino)glycine and N-<br>
(3-dodecylamino)propy]glycine.<br>
By the term "iodophores" we mean complexes of iodine or triodine -with a<br>
carrier, such as a neutral polymer. The carrier typically increases the<br>
solubility of iodine in water, provides a sustained release of the iodine and<br>
reduces the equilibrium concentrations of free iodine.<br>
Suitable polymeric carriers from which iodophores can be prepared include<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyether glycols such as polyethylene glycols,<br>
polyvinyl alcohols, polyacrylates, polyamides, polyalkylenes and<br>

The particular anti-microbial agents selected for use in the composition will<br>
14<br>
vary depending upon the environment in which the composition is intended<br>
to be used.<br>
The second compound is preferably chemically inert and has a structure that<br>
attaches to virtually any substrate. The second compound can, therefore,<br>
remain at a surface for long periods of time. This means that the<br>
composition of the invention can easily be recharged.<br>
The second compound is also capable of associating with the other<br>
components of the composition of the invention by means of non-chemical<br>
bonds and typically can adhere to and attract a wide range of polar materials<br>
including various anti-microbial agents.<br>
The second compound is preferably a surfactant or oil, more'preferably a<br>
short chain surfactant or oil. By the term "short chain" ~we mean Cn to Czo-<br>

ceramics, concrete, sand or grout as the functional material may, for<br>
example, be used in toilets, sinks, tile, flooring, stucco, plaster, cat litter,<br>

The anti-microbial composition can be combined into a very wide variety of<br>
functional compounds for the manufacturing, contracting and construction<br>
industries. The nature of the anti-microbial composition may be varied<br>
according to the particular functional compounds and the number and nature<br>
of microorganisms present in the particular functional compound or<br>
22<br>
environment in which it is used.<br>
The formulation preferably comprises from 0.1 wt% to 5.0 wt%, more<br>
preferably from 0.1 to 4.0 wt%3 even more preferably from 0.5 wt% to 2.0<br>
wt%, of the anti-microbialcomposition.<br>
The anti-micTobia] composition is highly effective against a broad range of<br>
microorganisms even when it is combined -with another functional material<br>
to provide the formulation of the invention. The formulation can,<br>
optionally, be applied to a surface. The formulation provides long-term<br>
anti-microbia] action, in both dry and damp conditions at the surfaces<br>
treated or in which the material is combined. This will lead to a sanin'sation<br>
of the surfaces so that the surfaces and products will prevent the rapid<br>
replication of microbial species and, thus, substantially reduce the risks of<br>
contamination and infection.<br>
The anti-mi crobial composition is mobile through most functional materials<br>
in which it is incorporated in the formulations of the invention. This is due<br>
to the presence of surfactant materials and oils and molecules of short chain<br>
length. In order to maintain tin's .mobility, the surfactant materials and oils<br>
preferably have a carbon chain length of no greater than 20.<br>
The anti-microbia] composition tends to migrate across a concentration<br>
gradient and moves to the surface of products into which it has been<br>
incorporated. This is similar to the behaviour of plasticiser in polymers.<br>
Both the anti-microbial composition and the formulation typically begin to<br>
dissociate into their component parts when they have been in continuous<br>
contact with water for longer than six to eight hours. The anti-microbia]<br>
action, of the anti-microbia] composition and the formulation, is<br>
23<br>
substantially reduced once the composition and formulation have<br>
dissociated into their component parts. The components can then act as a<br>
carbon source or nutrient for many species of microorganisms. Thus, the<br>
anti-microbial composition and the formulation can degrade when<br>
submersed in water, to provide a rinsate/leachate of low toxicity and which<br>
has a short residence time in the environment.<br>
It is thought that the rinsates have a low toxicity because the anti-microbial<br>
agents are associated with the second compound and so the composition<br>
does not readily dissociate in the presence of water.<br>
The formulation can be designed so that it is stable and effective in most<br>
manufacturing environments. The formulation is typically stable up to<br>
temperatures of 200°C.<br>
The property of mobility of the product permits materials that are highly<br>
frequently washed or rinsed to be "recharged'1 with the anti-microbial<br>
composition during a routine act of cleaning or maintenance.<br>
Typically, the anti-microbial composition is incorporated into a simple<br>
conventional detergent solution or added to a "final rinse" during cleaning.<br>
The anti-microbial composition will be drawn, due to the presence of its<br>
hydrophobic elements, into the surface of the product to be "recharged".<br>
The sanitizalion properties of the formulation are, therefore, restored<br>
without the need for re-manufacture or difficult treatment processes.<br>
Any wash off or rinsates containing the anti-microbial composition or<br>
formulation diluted by such a re-charging solution and water would quickly<br>
dissociate into the biodegradable components as previously discussed.<br>
24<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention., there is provided the use of<br>
an anti-microbial composition to prevent the formation of colonies of<br>
microorganisms on a surface at which it is provided.<br>
According to yet a further aspect of the invention, there is provided the use<br>
of a formulation to prevent the formation of colonies of microorganisms on<br>
a surface at which it is provided.<br>

Example 3 Preparation of Detergent Formulation comprising the Antimicrobial<br>
Agent Composition of Example 1 (i.e. D4L)<br>
An amphotenc non-ionic detergent, such as washing-up liquid, having a pH<br>
of from 6 to 8, was diluted in water in a ratio of 1 part detergent to 25 parts<br>
of water by volume. To this solution was added between 0.5 and 2.0 % by<br>
volume of the anti-microbial agent composition prepared according to<br>
Example 1 (i.e. D4L).<br>
Example 4 Effectiveness of Anti-mi crobial Agent Formulation against<br>
Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas<br>
aeruginosa.<br>
Method<br>
Two samples were tested. These were a detergent formulation prepared<br>
according to Example 3 comprising 2% by volume of the anti-microbial<br>
agent composition of Example 1, and a neutral detergent. The neutral<br>
detergent was used as a standard reference.<br>
A bacterial culture (0.1 rnJ) in a nutrient medium was applied to a<br>
previously sterilised petri dish over an area 7 x 5 cm. The bacterial culture<br>
was then allowed to dry for 30 minutes.<br>
29<br>
The inoculated area was then wiped with a test wipe soaked either in water<br>
or the test solution to contact the test fluid with the bacteria. The test<br>
solution was applied using either an absorbent cloth or an innoculum loop.<br>
The innoculated area was also left untreated to provide an "uncleaned<br>
control", in which the infected area was not washed or even wiped with<br>
water. The bacteria remaining on the surface of the petri dish were<br>
numerated after periods of 15 and.30 seconds.<br>
The bacteria remaining on the surface of the petri dish were numerated by<br>
wetting a sterile swab in a sterile peptone solution (0.1%) and thoroughly<br>
rubbing the swab over the area to be sampled, turning the swab as it was<br>
robbed over the appropriate area. The swab was then returned to a sterile<br>
tube; Ringers solution (5 ml, 1/4 strength) was added; and the swab left for<br>
at least 10 minutes.<br>
The swab tubes xvere plated out making serial decimal dilutions, using the<br>
Miles and Misra Total Viable Count Technique and incubated inverted at<br>
373C overnight. The number of colony forming units (CFU) (taken to be<br>
•viable bacterial individuals) was then counted.<br>
Calculation<br>
The log reduction in bacterial numbers was calculated compared to the<br>
water control and the uncleaned control.<br>
The total number of CFUs per ml of neat sample was calculated for each<br>
test sample and the controls.<br>
The log of the number of CFUs for the water control, or the uncleaned<br>
control, was calculated to give value A. This was repeated for the test anti-<br>
30<br>
nricro"bial composition to give value B.<br>
A-B - Log Reduction (A - log CFUs water or uncleaned control, B = log<br>
CFUS test sample)<br>
A log reduction of greater than 4 is considered to be effective.<br>

Method - Dry Film Fungal Resistance Test (Based on British Standard<br>
BS3900 Part G6)<br>
Each formulation was painted onto 6 x 9 cm gypsum panels. Two coats of<br>
each formulation were painted onto the gypsum panels, allowing 24 hours<br>
drying time between each coat. When the panels were dry, they were spray<br>
inoculated with a mixed spore suspension prepared from fungi (including<br>
yeasts) isolated from or known to grow on painted surfaces. The test panels<br>
were suspended in a high humidity cabinet at 24°C for four weeks and the<br>
resultant fungal growth assessed visually and microscopically. Fungal<br>

Method — Dry Film Algal Resistance Test - Vermiculite Bed Method<br>
Each formulation was painted onto 10 x 10 cm calcium silicate panels. Two<br>
coats of each formulation were painted onto the panels, allowing 24 hours<br>
drying time between each coat. When the panels were dry, they were<br>
weathered using a QUV Accelerated Weathering Tester for 125 hours using<br>
a water spray cycle. Each panel was then cut in half. The half panels were<br>
placed in the surface of vermjculite (200 g) moistened with water (800 cm3)<br>
in a transparent plastic box with a close fitting lid. The panels were each<br>
spray inoculated with a mixed algal suspension three times at intervals of<br>
two weeks and sprayed with water each week. The panels were incubated<br>
for 13 weeks at 20°C -and illuminated with 30 W daylight type fluorescent<br>
tubes (giving approximately 1000 lux) for 16 hours per day. The resultant<br>
algal growth was assessed visually and microscopically.<br>

Example 6 Microbiological Testing against MRSA of Coil Coating<br>
Panels Treated with the Anti-microbial Composition of<br>
Example 1<br>
Coil coating panels, manufactured by Becker Industrial Coatings Ltd.,<br>
Liverpool, were treated with a range of concentrations of an anti-microbial<br>
composition according to Example 1. The panels were then tested to<br>
demonstrate whether they have antibacterial properties against Methicillin<br>
Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA).<br>
The panels were coated as follows:<br>
51 Coil coating panel, 1.0% by volume anti-microbial composition<br>
52 Coil coating panel, 1.5% by volume anti-microbial composition<br>
53 Coil coating panel, 2.0% by volume anti-microbial composition<br>
54 Coil coating panel, 2.5% by volume anti-microbial composition<br>
55 Coil coating panel, 3.0% by volume anti-microbial composition<br>
56 Coil coating panel. 0% anti-microbial composition (control)<br>
Method<br>
The MRSA culture was diluted to approximately 1.5 x 10" CPU/ml with<br>
sterile deionised water. ] ml of this solution was placed on a coil coating<br>
panel and was continuously applied over an area of approximately 5 cm x 5<br>
cm using a hand held spreader for a contact period of 1 minute. The culture<br>
was immediately recovered from the panel using a swab and was transferred<br>
to a universal bottle containing neutralizer (1 ml) and maximum recovery<br>
diluent (9 ml). 10 fold serial dilutions were prepared and 0.1 ml aliquots of<br>
the dilutions were plated onto nutrient agar, in duplicate. The plates were<br>
incubated at 37°C for 24 hours and 48 hours and read using conventional<br>
36<br>
techniques.<br>
Tie procedure was repeated with a culture contact time of 5 minutes. All<br>
six samples were subjected to the same test protocol.<br>

Conclusion<br>
All of the test saropies (SI to S5) produced very significant decreases in the<br>
bacterial count (from 1.5 x ICr CFU/roJ) in 1 minute of contact time and<br>
further small decreases after 5 minutes. Total bacterial kill was not<br>
achieved in 5 minutes of contact.<br>
The control sample (S6) produced a small decrease in the bacterial count<br>
(from 1.5 x 103 CFU/mJ) in 1 minute of contact time, which may be<br>
primarily due to the difficulty of recovering the culture from the panels<br>
using swabbing techniques. After 5 minutes of contact time the control<br>
samples bacterial count had significantly decreased primarily due to the<br>
drying out of the culture during the continuous spreading action on the<br>
panels.<br>
37<br>
The coil coatings treated with the anti-microbial composition are effective,<br>
at all of the tested concentrations, in very significantly reducing the level of<br>
MRSA bacteria when in contact in an aqueous medium for short periods.<br>
These coatings would be very effective in assisting in the control of MRSA<br>
"bacterial contamination in hospitals and similar environment.<br>

Discussion<br>
The test samples (SI and S3) produced very significant decreases in the<br>
bacterial count (from 1.5 x 103 CFU/ml) in 1 minute of contact time and<br>
further small decreases after 5 minutes. Total bacterial kill was not<br>
achieved in 5 minutes of contact.<br>
The control samples (S2 and S4) produced significant but smaller decreases<br>
in the bacterial count (from 1.5 x 103 CFU/ml) in 1 minute and 5 minutes of<br>
contact time. This may be partially due to the difficulty of recovering the<br>
culture from the panels using swabbing techniques and to the drying out of<br>
39<br>
the culture during the continuous spreading action on the panels.<br>
Conclusions<br>
The PVC 94 laminated panels treated with 2% by volume anti-microhial<br>
composition, are effective in reducing the level of MRSA bacteria when in<br>
contact in an aqueous medium for short periods.<br>
These coatings would be likely to be very effective in assisting in the<br>
control of MRSA bacterial contamination in hospitals and similar<br>
environment.<br>

Conclusion<br>
The results show that the bacteria are almost completely eradicated within<br>
10 minutes contact time by the anti-microbial composition according to<br>
Example 1 in many of the paint/powder coating formulations, even though<br>
the surface is dry.<br>
.A powder coating containing the anti-microbial composition accordin g to<br>
Example 1 at the concentrations shown to be effective is, therefore, likely to<br>
be highly effective in reducing the number of bacteria on a surface in a short<br>
timescale.<br>

Conclusion<br>
Three samples, 1000 D4L, 1500 D4L and 2000 D4L, passed the European<br>
Suspension Test at 10°C, for all of the microorganisms under test. Under<br>
identical conditions 500 D4L failed the test.<br>
A comparison of the results of the tests of Examples 9 and 10 shows that the<br>
composition "D4L" is more effective than the composition "LCF". The<br>
composition "D4L" includes anti-microbial agents that are more polar than<br>
48<br>
those included in the composition "LCF". Thus, the inclusion of polar antimicrobial<br>
agents increases the efficacy of the composition.<br>
Example 12 The dissociation of the Anti-microbial Composition "D4L" of<br>
Example 1 upon immersion in water<br>
This Example was conducted to assess the difference in biofilm growth<br>
between experimental and control surfaces after 48 hours submersion in<br>
water. The experimental surfaces were coated with the anti-microbial<br>
composition but the control surfaces were not.<br>
Method<br>
Eight aluminium bottles were painted with four different paint types, The<br>
paint types were Series 1 to 4, as set out below. Four of the bottles were<br>
painted with paint including 2% by weight of the anti-microbial<br>
composition of Example 1 and four were painted with standard paint and<br>
used as controls.<br>
The paint types were as follows:<br>
Series 1: K Type Gloss (tough, durable enamel for high quality<br>
industrial finishing and decorative interior/exterior<br>
woods).<br>
Series 2: Matt White Emulsion (interior/exterior decorative<br>
duties. Contains a preservative for in can protection<br>
against microbial spoilage).<br>
49<br>
Series 3: Blue Hydracoat (waterborne alternative to alkyd synthetic<br>
enamels "used for toy and model coating).<br>
Series 4: Aquaguard (two pack epoxy coatings for walls and floors).<br>
Each bottle was placed into an inoculated solution, covered and incubated<br>
for 48 hours. The bottles were then removed and sprayed with 0.5%<br>
Tween/phosphate"buffer solution (100 ml) to remove any biofilra that had<br>
formed. The resulting solutions were plated out making serial decimal<br>
dilutions, using the Miles and Misra Total Viable Count Technique and<br>
incubated inverted at 37°C overnight. The number of colony forming units<br>
(CFU) (taken to be viable bacterial individuals) was then counted and the<br>
experimental plates were compared to the controls.<br>
Results<br>
Biofilm growth recovered after 24 hours - E. coli<br>
Series 1: 50% more growth on experimental, compared to the control.<br>
Series 2: No growth on experimental., very small growth on control.<br>
Series 3: 25% more growth on experimental, compared to control.<br>
Series 4: 43% more growth on experimental, compared to the control.<br>
Biofilm growth recovered after 24 hours - Pseudomonas aeruginosa<br>
Series 1: 50% more growth on experimental, compared to the control.<br>
Series 2: No growth on control, very smaJl growth on experimental.<br>
Series 3: 25% more growth on experimental, compared to control.<br>
Series 4; 20% more growth on experimental, compared to the control.<br>
50<br>
Conclusion<br>
The components of the anti-microbial compositions dissociate and dissolve<br>
in the surrounding solution and provide a carbon source for the microbial<br>
populations. The results show an increase in growth of microorganisms on<br>
the treated materials after 24 hour immersion in microbial broth. This<br>
indicates a more nutrient rich environment in the paints including the antimicrobial<br>
composition of the invention compared to the controls and shows<br>
that the anti-microbial composition is biodegradable.<br>
Example 13 Low Rinsate Toxicology<br>
Method<br>
Four different surface coatings, paint series 1 to 4 as described in Example<br>
12, were applied to aluminium panel substrates. These were then compared<br>
to controls that did not include the anti-microbial composition.<br>
The microorganisms used were E. coli and Pseudomonas aerogenosa.<br>
After 24 hours, the panels were rinsed with deionised water and the<br>
washings tested using Microtox Testing. This test uses a photoluminescent<br>
vibrio sp. (a bioluminous microbe) that is highly responsive to the effect of<br>
toxins. In the Microtox Test, a sample is mixed with living bacteria that are<br>
sensitive to the presence of toxic compounds. The mixture is allowed to<br>
regulate for a short time and then a light reading is taken. In the presence of<br>
substances at concentrations that are acutely toxic and which pose harm to<br>
humans, the bacteria are impaired and cease to give off light. Thus, the<br>
greater the light loss from a sample, the more toxic it is.<br>
51<br>
Results<br>
Figures 1 and 2 show the residual P. aeruginosa and E. cob" biofilm<br>
recovered after 24 hours, for the experimental and control samples<br>
respectively. It is clear from Figures 1 and 2 that the biofilm formation is<br>
greater for the control samples.<br>
Figures 3 and 4 show the toxicity of the surface rinsates for P. aeruginosa<br>
and E, coli, for the experimental and control samples respectively. Rinsates<br>
for the control samples are less toxic than for the experimental samples.<br>
However, the rinsates for both the experimental and the control samples<br>
showed low toxicity.<br>
Values for the effective concentration at which 50% of the population<br>
suffers from some adverse effect (EC50) were difficult to calculate and<br>
values for the lethal dose 50 (LD50) were not calculable.<br>
The rinsate of some of the anti-microbial compositions was similar in effect<br>
to that of the control of other test paints. For example, paint series 1<br>
including the anti-microbial composition had similar effect on the test as<br>
paint series 3 without the composition of the invention. Thus, different<br>
products of similar types (i.e. paints) have different results in the Microtox<br>
test on the rinsate. This indicates that the anti-microbial composition of the<br>
invention only has a small effect on the rinsate toxicology, which is within<br>
the normal range for products that do not include anti-microbial agents.<br>
Thus, the rinsate has low toxicity and is safe.<br>
Low toxicity of rinsates from the compositions of the invention is highly<br>
desirable for the environment.<br>

Example 14 Anti-micxobial Testing of Coated Panels<br>
Steel panels with a coating containing 0% (as a control), 1.5%, 2.0% and<br>
3.0% by volume of the anti-microbial composition of Example 1 were<br>
tested.<br>
The microorganisms used were:<br>
Methicillin resistant staph aureus (MRSA) NCTC11940/2.1x105 CFU/ml<br>
Pseudornonas aeruginosa NCIMB12469/2.9xl05 CFU/ml<br>
Eschericia coli NCTC9001/2.2xl05 CFU/ral<br>
Method<br>
The selected microorganism (0.1 ml) was transferred to each of the coated<br>
panels. A sheet of sterile plastic (5 cm x 5 cm) was placed onto the<br>
microorganism, which was then carefully spread to fill the area covered by<br>
the plastic film.<br>
The first set of samples was processed immediately on completion of the<br>
above procedure, i.e. at 0 min.<br>
The plastic film was removed and placed onto a ceramic tile, ensuring that<br>
:he surface that had been in contact with the contaminated plate was<br>
ippermost. The exposed surface was then swabbed to remove all traces of<br>
the microorganism and the swab was transferred to 10 ml of maximum<br>
recovery diluent (MRD). A. second swab was used to swab the<br>
contaminated area on the surface of the panel. This swab was also<br>
transferred to the same vial of MRD and the vial was allowed to stand for<br>
53<br>
10 min to ensure that the swabs were well soaked. The vial was then<br>
whirlimixed thoroughly for 10 seconds.<br>
The resulting mixture (0.1 ml) was then transferred onto nutrient agar plates<br>
f and the plates were incubated at 37°C for 48 hours.<br>
The procedure was repeated on a further two sets of samples after a 30 min<br>
and 16 hour contact period at 25°C.<br>
Results<br>
The results of the tests undertaken on the coated panels are detailed in Table<br>
16, 17 and 18. The results in Table 16 should be read as the base data with<br>
which the results obtained after 30 min and 16 hours are compared.<br>
However, it is clear from the variation is the results that recovery of the<br>
contaminating organisms is not entirely consistent.<br>

Conclusion<br>
The results in Table 17 show that, even after 30 minutes contact, the<br>
antibacterial effect of the anti-microbial composition is evident. The<br>
consistently higher counts obtained from the control panel support this. In<br>
addition, there is a significant difference between the counts from the test<br>
55<br>
panel containing 1.5% by volume of the anti-microbial composition and<br>
from the test panels containing 2.0% and 3.0% by volume of the antimicrobial<br>
composition, again supporting the antibacterial effect of the<br>
composition of the invention.<br>
The counts detailed in Table 18 after 16 hours contact also endorse the<br>
antibacterial effect (_•_ the anti-microbinl composition although the<br>
consistently lower control figures suggest that there may have been a drying<br>
out effect during incubation.<br>
The results demonstrate that the anti-mi crobial composition of the invention<br>
confers an antibacterial effect on the panel coatings, giving the most<br>
effective kill at an inclusion rate 2.0% by volume or greater.<br><br><br>
