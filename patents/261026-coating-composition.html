				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a coating composition capable<br>
of being cured at ambient temperature and useful as a<br>
protective coating for steel structures and/or as a weatherresistant<br>
exterior coating.<br>
Curable coating compositions based on a silane or<br>
siloxane containing at least two alkoxy groups bonded to<br>
silicon by Si-O-C bonds are known for example from US-A-<br>
3917648, US-A-4113665, US-A-3776881, US-A-5275645 and US-A-<br>
5292799.<br>
US-A-4250074 describes the production of coatings of<br>
modified epoxy polymers with improved resistance to solvent,<br>
acid and base by forming an interpenetrating polymer network<br>
(IPN) of a polymerised epoxy resin network intertwined with<br>
a polysiloxane network formed by the hydrolytic<br>
polycondensation of silane groups. This is achieved by the<br>
simultaneous polymerisation, at substantially balanced<br>
reaction rates, of a mixture of epoxy resin and silane<br>
groups to form the two intertwined networks extending<br>
throughout the coating. An amine curing agent forms the<br>
epoxy network, and water distributed throughout the mixture<br>
causes the hydrolytic polycondensation of the silane groups.<br>
A preferred method for preparing the IPN is to react epoxy<br>
resin with an aminosilane capable of both hydrolytic<br>
polycondensation of the silane moiety and amine addition of<br>
the oxirane rings of the epoxy resin.<br>
WO-A-96/16109 describes a fully cured noninterpenetrating<br>
network epoxy-modified polysiloxane coating<br>
composition prepared by combining water, a non-aromatic<br>
epoxide resin having more than one 1,2-epoxy group per<br>
molecule with an epoxide equivalent weight in the range of<br>
from 100 to about 500, a polysiloxane , an organo-oxysilane,<br>
a hardener component comprising a difunctional amine and/or<br>
an aminosilane, and a pigment or .aggregate component.<br>
US-A-4678835 describes a coating composition containing<br>
an ungelled reaction product of (i) at least 2 percent by<br>
weight of an amine having in a molecule thereof at least one<br>
amino hydrogen atom and at least one silicon atom directly<br>
bonded to a hydrolysable group, (ii) at least 4 percent by<br>
weight of a material containing at least one epoxide group,<br>
and (iii) a material selected from vinyl alkoxysilanes, nonfunctional<br>
organosilanes, organosilicates and partial<br>
hydrolysis products thereof.<br>
US-A-4698406 describes a curable silicone composition<br>
comprising (i) an amine-functional organopolysiloxane and<br>
(ii) an acryl-functional organopolysiloxane selected from<br>
acryloxy-, methacryloxy or acrylamide-functional<br>
organopolysiloxanes.<br>
US-A-4429082 describes an anhydrous ungelled reaction<br>
product characterised in having a non-vinyl addition backbone<br>
being essentially acrylyl-free, having a silicon<br>
content of up to about 12 percent, and derived from the<br>
reaction of (a) a condensation product having at least 2<br>
amine-reactive acrylyl residues per molecule and (b) an<br>
jt<br>
amino silane.<br>
EP-A-725088 describes a process for post-reacting<br>
polymers having acetoacetate functional groups comprising<br>
polymerising a monomer mixture comprising an acetoacetatefunctional<br>
monomer and a vinyl monomer, and then after<br>
polymerisation post-reacting the acetoacetate-functional<br>
polymer product with an amino-functional silane.<br>
A curable coating composition according to the present<br>
invention has a binder comprising a compound or polymer (A)<br>
containing at least one primary or secondary amine group and<br>
a compound or polymer (B) containing at least one<br>
ethylenically unsaturated double bond activated by an<br>
adjacent electron-withdrawing group. The compound or polymer<br>
(B) contains at least two  activated ethylenically<br>
unsaturated double bonds if the compound or polymer (A)<br>
contains only one primary or secondary amine group. The<br>
coating composition is characterised in that either (A) or<br>
(B) contains at least one silicon-bonded alkoxy group in its<br>
molecule and the composition additionally contains a polymer<br>
(C) containing at least two silicon-bonded alkoxy groups.<br>
When the coating composition of the invention is coated<br>
on a substrate and allowed to cure at ambient (or higher)<br>
temperature and humidity (for example 5 to 45Â°C and 20 to<br>
90% relative humidity), , the binder cures both by Michaeltype<br>
addition reaction of the amine group of (A) with the<br>
activated ethylenically unsaturated double bond of (B) and<br>
by hydrolysis and condensation of the Si-O-C bonds of (C)<br>
and whichever of (A) and (B) contains a silicon-bonded<br>
alkoxy group in its molecule, forming a flexible adherent<br>
coating film resistant to heat and weathering. The said<br>
component (A) or (B) containing a silicon-bonded alkoxy<br>
group as well as either an amine group or an activated<br>
double bond can take part in crosslinking reactions with all<br>
the components of the binder.<br>
In one preferred coating composition according to the<br>
invention the compound or polymer (A) is a silane or<br>
siloxane containing at least two alkoxy groups bonded to<br>
silicon cy si-o-C bonds and also containing at least one<br>
primary or secondary amine group. Such a silane or siloxane<br>
(A) can be an aminoalkyl silane containing at least two,<br>
preferably three, alkoxy groups bonded to silicon and/or an<br>
organopolysiloxane containing both aminoalkyl and Si-bonded<br>
alkoxy groups. Most preferably, for finish coatings having<br>
high gloss and high weathering resistance, the polymer (C)<br>
is a polyorganosiloxane and the silane or siloxane (A) is an<br>
aminoalkyl silane containing at least two alkoxy groups<br>
bonded to silicon. Such aminoalkyl silanes are commercially<br>
available and have good reactivity both in Michael-type<br>
reactions and in condensation of alkoxysilyl groups.<br>
Aminoalkyl-substituted alkoxy-terminated poly-<br>
Thus, according to another aspect of the invention a<br>
curable coating composition comprises a polyorganosiloxane<br>
(C) containing at least two alkoxy groups bonded to silicon<br>
and an aminoalkyl silane (A) containing at least one alkoxy<br>
group bonded to silicon and is characterised in that the<br>
composition additionally contains a compound or polymer (B)<br>
containing at least two ethylenically unsaturated double<br>
bonds each activated by an adjacent electron-withdrawing<br>
group, whereby the coating is capable of curing at ambient<br>
temperature and humidity both by hydrolysis and condensation<br>
of the Si-O-C bonds of the polyorganosiloxane (C) and of the<br>
aminoalkyl silane (A) and by Michael-type addition reaction<br>
of the amine group of the aminoalkyl silane (A) with the<br>
activated ethylenically unsaturated double bonds of (B).<br>
Examples of preferred aminoalkyl silanes are primary<br>
amines such as 3-aminopropyl triethoxy silane, 3-aminopropyl<br>
trimethoxy silane, 3-aminopropyl methyl dimethoxysilane or<br>
3-aminopropyl methyl diethoxy silane, primary secondary<br>
4<br>
amines such as N-(2-aminoethyl)-3-aminopropyl trimethoxy<br>
silane, secondary amines such as N-methyl- or N-phenyl-3-<br>
aminopropyl trimethoxy silane, condensed aminoalkyl silanes<br>
such as bis(3-aminopropyl) tetramethoxy or tetraethoxy<br>
disiloxane NH2(CH2)3-Si (OCH3)2-0- (CH30)2Si- (CH2)3NH2,<br>
polyglycolether-modified aminosilanes such as that sold<br>
under the Trademark "Dynasylan 121" and triaminofunctional<br>
propyl trimethoxy silanes such as "Dynasylan TRIAMO"<br>
available from Hiils AG. Similar silanes having two or three<br>
silicon atoms can be used.<br>
The polymer (C) having at least two Si-bonded alkoxy<br>
groups used in the first aspect of the invention is<br>
preferably a polyorganosiloxane, as is the polymer (C) used<br>
in the second aspect, for example of the formula:-<br>
where each of the groups R1 is an alkyl group, preferably<br>
having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, each R is an alkyl, aryl or<br>
alkoxy group and is preferably an alkyl group having 1 to <br>
carbon atoms, or a phenyl group, each R2 is an alkoxy group,<br>
preferably having 1 to 6, carbon atoms, a hydrocarbyl group<br>
such as an alkyl (preferably having 1 to 6 carbon atoms) or<br>
phenyl group or a branching group of the formula:<br>
where each R4 is an alkyl, aryl or alkoxy group, preferably<br>
having up to 6 carbon atoms, and R5 is a group of the formula<br>
-0-Si(R4)3 where the groups R4 can be the same or different,<br>
R3 is an alkoxy, alkyl or aryl group, preferably having up to<br>
6 carbon atoms, and n is a, number such that the polysiloxane<br>
contains 3-100 silicon atoms, preferably 4 to 25 silicon<br>
atoms . The polyorganosiloxane can for example be a<br>
polydiorganosiloxane or a polymer having a proportion of<br>
diorganosiloxane units, and such polymers may be<br>
particularly preferred for high-gloss finish coatings having<br>
good resistance to weathering, especially in sunlight. The<br>
polyorganosiloxane can alternatively be an oligomeric alkyl<br>
silicate containing units of the formula: -<br>
where R* is alkyl, preferably having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and<br>
branching units such as:-<br>
Inclusion of such oligomeric alkyl silicates is particularly<br>
preferred in heat-resistant coatings.<br>
The groups R1 are preferably methyl, ethyl and/or butyl<br>
groups. The groups R can be the same or different; for<br>
example diorganosiloxane .units can be dimethyls iloxane units<br>
or can be alkyl phenyl, for example methyl phenyl, siloxane<br>
units or diphenylsiloxane units; the polyorganosiloxane can<br>
be a methyl phenyl polysiloxane containing a selection of<br>
such units.<br>
Oligomeric alkyl silicates are available commercially,<br>
for example the material sold under the Trademark "Silres<br>
MSB 100" having the empirical formula CH3Si (O) lfl (OCH3) <br>
The polymer (C) can alternatively be an organic polymer<br>
containing alkoxysilicon groups, for example a<br>
trimethoxysilyl-functional polybutadiene derivative or an<br>
acrylic polymer containing pendent trialkoxysilyl groups.<br>
The activated ethylenically unsaturated double bond of<br>
the compound or polymer (B) is activated by at least one<br>
adjacent electron-withdrawing group such as a carboxyl,<br>
carbonyl or carbonamide group. Preferably, the compound or<br>
polymer (B) contains two such activated double bonds. Most<br>
preferably, the ethylenically unsaturated double bonds are<br>
present as alpha, beta-ethylenically unsaturated carboxylate<br>
ester groups such as acrylate, methacrylate, maleate or<br>
fumarate groups. (B) can for example be a compound which is<br>
an acrylate or methacrylate ester of a polyol, for example<br>
propylene glycol diacrylate or di- or tri-propylene glycol<br>
diacrylate, trimethylolpropane triacrylate,<br>
trimethylolethane triacrylate, 1', 6-hexanediol diacrylate,<br>
1,4-butanediol   diacrylate   or   dimethacrylate   and/or pentaerythritol   tri-   or   tetra-acrylate.    (B)   can alternatively be an oligomer or polymer, for example of molecular weight at least 300 up to 3000 or 5000, containing at least two acrylate or methacrylate groups. Acrylate groups are preferred because they are more reactive in the Michael reaction at ambient temperature than methacrylate groups,  and  the  acrylate  or  methacrylate  groups  are preferably present  as  terminal  groups.  When using an aminoalkyl trialkoxy silane  (A),  an acrylate-functional oligomer (B) is particularly preferred for forming coatings with improved flexibility.<br>
One preferred type of polymer (B) is a urethane acrylate. This can be formed for example by the reaction of an isocyanate-tipped prepolymer with a hydroxyalkyl acrylate or methacrylate such as hydroxyethyl acrylate. The isocyanate-tipped prepolymer can for example be formed by reaction of a polyether or polyester polyol with excess of a diisocyanate such as hexamethylene diisocyanate, isophorone diisocyanate, tolylene diisocyanate or methylene bis(phenyl isocyanate). Alternatively, the polymer (B) can be an epoxyacrylate (an acrylate ester derived from an epoxy resin by reaction with acrylic or methacrylic acid), a polyether acrylate, for example propoxylated glycerol triacrylate or polypropylene glycol diacrylate, a polyester acrylate, melamine resin acrylate, a polyamide acrylate, an acrylic polymer having pendent acrylate groups, a silicone acrylate which may or may not contain Si-bonded alkoxy groups, or a polyester oligomer containing maleate or fumarate ester units.<br>
The component (B) can be a blend of different types of acrylates or methacrylates, for example a blend of acrylate-functional polymers of different types or a blend of an acrylate-functional polymer with a non-polymeric di- or triacrylate, for example a urethane acrylate with tripropyleneglycol diacrylate. The viscosity of the uncured<br><br>
coating composition can be varied by varying the proportions of the more viscous acrylate-ftinctional polymer and the less viscous non-polymeric multifunctional acrylate.<br>
Alternatively, or additionally, the compound or polymer 5 (B) can comprise a silane or siloxane containing at least one ethylenically unsaturated double bond activated by an adjacent  electron-withdrawing  group  and  at  least  two silicon-bonded  alkoxy  groups,  for  example  a  silane containing at least two alkoxy groups bonded to silicon by I Si-O-C bonds and also containing at least one alpha, beta-ethylenically unsaturated carboxylate ester group. Examples of such silanes are 3-methacryloxypropyl triethoxy silane, 3 -acryloxypropyl    trimethoxy    silane   and   3-methacrylamidopropyl trimethoxy silane. Acrylate-functional siloxanes can alternatively be used.<br>
Such an acrylate-functional silane or siloxane (B) is prefercdbly used in conjunction with a polyamine (A) . The polyamine preferably consists  at  least partly of  an oligomeric or polymeric amine, particularly if none of (B) is present as an oligomer or polymer.  The oligomeric or polymeric amine can for example be an amino-functional polyamide,  polyether  (for example a "Jeffamine"  -trade mark), polyurea or polyurethane, containing at least two primary or secondary amine groups, most preferably as terminal groups, or a Mannich base such as that derived from ethylene diamine, formaldehyde and a siibstituted phenol such as an alkyl, e.g. nonyl, phenol or cardanol. The coating composition based on an acrylate-functional silane (B) can alternatively or additionally contain a non-polymeric aliphatic or cycloaliphatic amine such as 2-methyl-l,5-pentane-diamine, hexamethylene diamine, 4,4'-methylene bis-(cyclo-hexylamine) or trimethylhexamethylene (any isomer) diamine.<br>
The polymer (C) used in such coating compositions containing a polyamine and an acrylate-functional alkoxy silane is preferably a polyorganosiloxane (C) of any of the<br><br>
types described above, for example a linear or branched<br>
polydiorganosiloxane or an oligomeric alkyl silicate.<br>
The amine group of the amino-functional compound or<br>
polymer (A) can be present in blocked form, for example as<br>
a ketimine, to extend pot life, if this is desired.<br>
Ketimines can be formed readily by the reaction of primary<br>
amino groups with a ketone, for example methyl isobutyl<br>
ketone or methyl amyl ketone.<br>
The total silane and/or siloxane material (C) in the<br>
binder of the coating composition, including any aminofunctional<br>
silane or siloxane (A), any ethylenically<br>
unsaturated silane or siloxane (B) and any alkoxy-functional<br>
polyorganosiloxane (C) which has no amino functionality or<br>
activated double bonds, is preferably at least 30% and most<br>
preferably at least 50 or 60% by weight up to 80, 90 or even<br>
100% by weight. Where (A) is an aminoalkyl silane containing<br>
at least two alkoxy groups, it preferably forms 5 to 40% by<br>
weight of the binder. As well as reacting with both the<br>
other ingredients of the binder to bond them into a<br>
crosslinked network, the amino-functional silane (A) ensures<br>
that the coating adheres well to substrates, particularly<br>
metal substrates such as steel. Too high a level of amine<br>
may, however, impart a susceptibility of the coating to<br>
yellowing. The polyorganosiloxane (C) preferably forms at<br>
least 25% and most preferably at least 40% by weight of the<br>
binder. Increasing amounts of polyorganosiloxane in the<br>
binder generally confer increased resistance to weathering,<br>
particularly resistance to sunngnt exoosure anrf increased<br>
hardness of the cured coating. Maximum weathering resistance<br>
(as shown Dy gloss retention in QUV accelerated weathering<br>
tests) is generally attained by compositions in which the<br>
polyorganosiloxane (C) is present at at least 50% up to 85<br>
or 90% by weight of the binder.<br>
The compound or polymer (B) generally comprises at<br>
least 5 or 10% by weight of the binder of the coating<br>
composition up to 30 or 40% of the binder, or even up to 50<br>
or 70% when an acrylate-tipped polymer (B) is used.<br>
Increasing amounts of acrylate-tipped polymer, for example<br>
an acrylate-tipped polyurethane, impart increased<br>
flexibility and toughness to the coating.<br>
The molar ratio of amino groups of (A) to activated<br>
ethylenically unsaturated double bonds of (B) present in the<br>
coating composition can in general be in the range 1:10 to<br>
10:1; molar ratios of at least 1:2 and up to 3:1 or 5:1 may<br>
be preferred. In general, higher levels of amine within<br>
these ranges, and particularly higher levels of an<br>
aminosilane such as an aminoalkyl trialkoxy silane, lead to<br>
harder coatings.<br>
The coating compositions of the invention may<br>
additionally (as well as compound or polymer (A) having at<br>
least one primary or secondary amine group) contain one or<br>
more compounds or polymers containing other groups effective<br>
as electron donors in Michael or Michael-type addition<br>
reactions with activated double bonds, for example thiol<br>
(mercaptan) groups or activated -CH- groups bonded to at<br>
least two electron-withdrawing groups, particularly<br>
activated methylene groups such as acetoacetate,<br>
cyanoacetate or malonate ester groups. The coating<br>
composition can for example contain a mercaptopropyl<br>
triethoxy silane, or an acetoacetate ester of a diol or<br>
triol such as tripropyleneglycol bis(acetoacetate) or<br>
polyethyleneglycol bis(acetoacetate), or a low molecular<br>
weight acetoacetate-terminated polyester.<br>
The coating compositions according to the invention may<br>
contain a compound which acts as a catalyst for Si-O-Si<br>
condensation. In general, the coatings are capable of curing<br>
under ambient temperature and humidity conditions to a tackfree<br>
coating in 2 to 20 hours even without such a catalyst,<br>
but a catalyst may be preferred to give a faster cure.<br>
One example of a catalyst for Si-O-Si condensation is<br>
an alkoxytitanium.compound, for example a titanium chelate<br>
compound such as a titanium bis (acetylacetonate) dialkoxide,<br>
e.g. titanium bis(acetylacetonate) diisopropoxide, a<br>
titanium bis(acetoacetate) dialkoxide, e.g. titanium<br>
bis(ethylacetoacetate) diisopropoxide, or an alkanolamine<br>
titanate, e.g. titanium bis (triethanolamine) diisopropoxide,<br>
or an alkoxy titanium compound which is not a chelate such<br>
as tetra(isopropyl) titanate or tetrabutyl titanate. Such<br>
titanium compounds containing alkoxy groups bonded to<br>
titanium may not act soleJLy as catalysts, since the titanium<br>
alkoxide group is hydrolysable and the catalyst may become<br>
bound into the cured silane or siloxane by Si-O-Ti linkages.<br>
The presence of such titanium moieties in the cured product<br>
may be advantageous in giving even higher heat-stability.<br>
The titanium compound can for example be used at 0.1 to 5%<br>
by weight of the binder. Corresponding alkoxide compounds of<br>
zirconium or aluminium are also useful as catalysts.<br>
An alternative catalyst is a nitrate of a polyvalent<br>
metal ion such as calcium nitrate, magnesium nitrate/<br>
aluminium nitrate, zinc nitrate or strontium nitrate.<br>
Calcium nitrate has been suggested as a catalyst for the<br>
amine curing of epoxy resins, but it has never been<br>
suggested for the curing of silane or siloxane materials.<br>
Surprisingly, we have found that calcium nitrate is an<br>
effective catalyst for the curing by Si-O-Si condensation of<br>
a silane or siloxane containing at least two alkoxy groups<br>
bonded to silicon by Si-O-C bonds, when the composition also<br>
includes an organic amine. The calcium nitrate is preferably<br>
used in its tetrahydrate form but other hydrated forms can<br>
be used. The level of calcium nitrate catalyst required is<br>
generally not more than 3% by weight of the binder, for<br>
example 0.05 to 3% by weight. Coatings cured using calcium<br>
nitrate catalyst are especially resistant to yellowina on<br>
exposure to sunlight.<br>
Another example of a suitable catalyst is an organotin<br>
compound, for example a dialkyltin dicarboxylate such as<br>
dibutyltin dilaurate or dibutyltin diacetate. Such an<br>
organotin catalyst can for example be used at 0.05 to 3% by<br>
weight of the binder of the coating composition.<br>
Other compounds effective as catalysts in the coating<br>
compositions of the invention are organic salts, such as<br>
carboxylates, of bismuth, for example bismuth<br>
tris(neodecanoate}. Organic salts and/or chelates of other<br>
metals such as zinc, aluminium, zirconium, tin, calcium,<br>
cobalt or strontium, for,example zirconium acetylacetonate,<br>
zinc acetate, zinc acetylacetonate, zinc octoate, stannous<br>
octoate, stannous oxalate, calcium acetylacetonate, calcium<br>
acetate, calcium 2-ethylhexanoate, cobalt naphthenate,<br>
calcium dodecylbenzenesulphonate or aluminium acetate, may<br>
also be effective as catalysts.<br>
The coating compositions of the invention can contain<br>
one or more further ingredients. They can for example<br>
contain one or more pigments, for example titanium dioxide<br>
(white pigment), coloured pigments such as yellow or red<br>
iron oxide or a phthalocyanine pigment and/or one or more<br>
'strengthening pigments such as micaceous iron oxide or<br>
crystalline silica and/or one or more anticorrosive pigments<br>
such as metallic zinc, zinc phosphate, wollastonite or a<br>
chromate, xnolybdate or phosphonate, and/or a filler pigment<br>
such as barytas, talc or calcium carbonate. The composition<br>
may contain a thickening agent such as fine-particle silica,<br>
bentonite clay, hydrogenated castor oil or a polyamide wax.<br>
The composition may also contain a plasticiser, pigment<br>
dispersant, stabiliser, flow aid or thinning solvent.<br>
The coating composition of the- invention is generally<br>
stqred__as a 2-pack coating in which the compound or oolvmer<br>
(A) containing at least one primary or secondary amine group<br>
is packaged separately from the compound or oolvmer (B)<br>
containing activated double bonds and preferably also<br>
separately from the alkoxy-silicon functional polymer (C).<br>
The amine (A) is reactive at "ambient temperature with the<br>
activated unsaturated material (B) and also accelerates the<br>
silane condensation reaction. The components (B) and (C) can<br>
generally be stored together for long periods in the absence<br>
of amino groups. The separately packaged amine (A) is<br>
preferably mixed with the ethylenically unsaturated compound<br>
or polymer (B) and the silicon-containing polymer (C) no<br>
more than 4 hours before the coating composition is coated<br>
on the substrate. It can, for example, be mixed into the<br>
coating composition shortly before application by spray,<br>
brush or roller, or the .separately packaged components can<br>
be applied by twin-feed spray.<br>
Alternatively, the amine-functional material (A) can be<br>
pre-treated with the ethylenically unsaturated material (B)<br>
and mixed with the polymer (C) to form a single-pack<br>
composition provided that these steps are carried out in the<br>
absence of any moisture. When the single-pack composition is<br>
coated on a substrate it will be cured by atmospheric<br>
moisture leading to siloxane condensation. We have, however,<br>
found that it is difficult to form such a single-pack<br>
composition without gelation. Moreover, the coatings formed<br>
by curing the amino-functional material, acrylate-functional<br>
material and polysiloxane together are generally glossier<br>
and more scratch-resistant than coatings formed from prereacted<br>
materials. Such a single-pack coating composition<br>
preferably contains a water-scavenger such as triethyl<br>
orthoformate which reacts with water to form a compound<br>
harmless in the coating. Such water-scavengers can also be<br>
used to advantage in 2-pack compositions in any package<br>
containing alkoxysilane or aIkoxysiloxane materials,<br>
particularly in a package which also contains pigments which<br>
can be a source of moisture.<br>
The coating compositions of the invention generally<br>
cure at ambient temperatures, for example 5 to 30Â°C, and are<br>
thus suitable for application to large structures where<br>
heat-curing is impractical. The coating compositions of the<br>
invention can alternatively be cured at elevated<br>
temperatures, for example from 30 to 50Â°C up to 100 or<br>
130Â°C. The hydrolysis of silicon-bonded alkoxy groups<br>
depends on the presence of moisture; in almost all climates<br>
atmospheric moisture is sufficient but a controlled amount<br>
of moisture may need to be added to the coating when curing<br>
at elevated temperature or when curing in very low humidity<br>
(desert) locations. The water is preferably packaged<br>
separate from any compound or polymer containing siliconbonded<br>
alkoxy groups.<br>
The coating compositions of the invention can in<br>
general be used as finish coatings and/or primer coatings.<br>
Coating compositions containing a relatively high proportion<br>
of polysiloxane (C) , for example containing polysiloxane (C)<br>
plus alkoxysilane (A) or (B) at more than 60 or 70% by<br>
weight of the binder, have high gloss which is retained<br>
remarkably well on weathering and UV exposure. They are<br>
particularly suitable for coating substrates which are<br>
exposed to the weather, e.g. sunlight, for long periods<br>
before recoating. The highest levels of gloss may be<br>
achieved if the coating composition includes an__or.ganic<br>
+<br>
solvent (thinner)such as xylene, although use of solvent is<br>
not generally necessary in the coating compositions of the<br>
invention, which can be 100% solids coatings having very low<br>
measured volatile organic content. The coating composition<br>
can contain an alcohol, e.g. ethanol or butanol, preferably<br>
packaged with the alkoxysilyl-functional component, to<br>
extend pot life and control initial speed of curing. A<br>
finish coating according to the invention can be applied<br>
over various primer coatings, for example inorganic zinc<br>
silicate or organic zinc-rich silicate primers and organic,<br>
e.g. epoxy resin, primers containing zinc metal, corrosioninhibiting,<br>
metal flake or barrier pigments. The coating<br>
composition of the invention has particularly good adhesion<br>
to inorganic zinc silicate coatings without needing an<br>
intermediate tie coat or mist coat. A finish coating<br>
composition of the invention can also be applied directly<br>
over aluminium or zinc "metal spray" coatings, whereby it<br>
acts as a sealer as well as a top coat, or over galvanised<br>
steel, stainless steel, aluminium, or plastics surfaces such<br>
as glass fibre reinforced polyester or a polyester gel coat.<br>
The coating composition can for example be used as a finish<br>
coating on buildings, steel structures, automobiles,<br>
aircraft and other vehicles and general industrial machinery<br>
and fitments. The finish coating can be pigmented or can be<br>
a clear (non-pigmented) coat, particularly on cars or<br>
yachts. The coating composition can be applied direct to<br>
prepared carbon steel as. a primer/finish.<br>
The coating composition of the invention can<br>
alternatively be used as a protective primer coating,<br>
particularly on steel surfaces, for example bridges,<br>
pipelines, industrial plant or buildings, oil and gas<br>
installations or ships. For this use it is generally<br>
pigmented with anticorrosive pigments. It may for example be<br>
pigmented with zinc dust; coatings according to the<br>
invention have similar anticorrosive performance to known<br>
zinc silicate coatings but are less liable to mud-cracking<br>
and can be readily overcoated, ^ particularly with a<br>
polysiloxane finish, for example a finish coat according to<br>
the present invention. Primer coating compositions according<br>
to the invention can be used as maintenance and repair<br>
coatings on less than perfect surfaces such as aged blasted<br>
steel or "ginger" (steel which has been blasted and has<br>
started to rust in small spots), hand-prepared weathered<br>
steel and aged coatings.<br>
As well as outstanding resistance to UV weathering, the<br>
coatings produced from the compositions of the invention<br>
have good flexibility and adhesion to most surfaces and have<br>
higher heat resistance (up to 150Â°C and usually up to 200Â°C)<br>
than most organic coatings.<br>
The invention is illustrated by the following Examples:<br>
Example 1<br>
49.13g titanium dioxide pigment was dispersed in 18.91g<br>
of an alkoxy- tipped silicone in the presence of 0.35g of<br>
pigment dispersant (EFKA 54 from Stort Chemicals), 0.69g of<br>
thickening agent (bentone) and 0.30g of defoamer (Byk-70<br>
from Byk-Chemie) under moisture- free conditions. The alkoxytipped<br>
silicone was a methyl phenyl polysiloxane (3074 from<br>
Dow Corning) of molecular weight about 1300, believed to be<br>
tipped with units having, me thoxy bonded to silicon.<br>
The resulting pigment dispersion was let down<br>
successively with a further 9.32g of the above alkoxy-tipped<br>
silicone, 12.43g of tripropyleneglycol diacrylate (Laromer<br>
TPGDA from BASF) and 0.64g of Tilcom KE2 (titanium bis (ethyl<br>
acetoacetate) diisopropoxide from Tioxide Specialities) . The<br>
composition was filled into a can and sealed to exclude<br>
moisture.<br>
The above base composition was cured with 8.23g of 3-<br>
aminopropyl trie thoxysi lane (A1100 from Osi Specialities)<br>
which was mixed into the base composition just before<br>
spraying. The mixture was sprayed onto a steel panel at a<br>
dry film thickness of 100 microns. The coating was allowed<br>
to cure under ambient conditions (23 Â°C and 65% relative<br>
humidity) . The coating was touch dry after 3 hours, and<br>
after 10 hours it had formed a hard, tough film.<br>
2 to 7<br>
Two-pack coating compositions were prepared as<br>
described in Example 1 from the following components<br>
(figures in per cent by weight) :-<br>
Pigment Dispersion<br>
Titanium Dioxide<br>
SY550 methyl phenyl silicone containing siliconbonded<br>
alkoxy groups (from Wacker)<br>
3074 alkoxy-tipped silico<br>
