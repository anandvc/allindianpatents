A motor car which can be configured selectively either as a spider or as a coupe<br>
The present invention relates to a motor car with an openable roof.<br>
In more detail, this motor car includes a rear luggage compartment with an upper closure element and a roof having an aperture over the median and rear portions of the passenger compartment, with which are associated at least first and second sliding panels, selectively positionable in a first configuration closing the aperture, in which the aforesaid panels are juxtaposed in series along the longitudinal axis of the.car, and a second configuration in which the aperture is open and the said panels are stored in the luggage compartment, the front edge of the said luggage compartment covering' element being adjacent the rear edge of the rearmost panel which is in its most retracted position in the said first closure configuration. In the first, closure configuration, the motor car has the appearance of a coupe, while in the second, open configuration it has the appearance of a spider.<br>
A known motor car of the aforesaid type is described in the earlier document US-A-2002/0135200. In this motor car, when the sliding panels are stored in the luggage compartment they are arranged vertically in the front portion thereof, taking up a considerable amount of space, in particular in the spider configuration when.all the panels are thus stored.<br>
The object of the present invention is therefore to provide a motor car which can be configured selectively as a spider model or a coupe model and in which the space taken up in the<br><br>
luggage compartment by the panels in the spider configuration does not overly compromise luggage capacity.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by providing a motor car of the type indicated at the beginning of this description and characterised in that it includes a support structure housed in the upper portion of the said luggage compartment beneath the closure element, the said panels being stacked within the said support structure in the second configuration in which the aperture is open.<br>
In this configuration, the panels are stored in the least useful portion of the luggage compartment, thus minimizing the penalty on the luggage capacity of the luggage space.<br>
Further advantages and characteristics of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed<br>
		■* *<br>
description, provided purely by way' of non-limitative example with reference to the appended drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a longitudinally sectioned schematic view of a car of the invention configured as a coupe,<br>
Figures 2 to 5 are longitudinally sectioned schematic views of the car of Figure 1, illustrating various stages in the conversion from the coupe configuration to the spider configuration,<br>
Figure 6 is a longitudinally sectioned schematic view of the cax of the invention configured as a spider,<br>
Figure 7 is a schematic perspective view of the car of Figure 1 configured as a coupe,<br>
Figure 8 is a schematic perspective view of the car of Figure 1 configured as a spider, and<br>
Figure 9, 10 and 11 are schematic views in longitudinal section, which illustrate the final phases of the transition<br><br>
from the coupe configuration to the spider configuration of a second embodiment of the invention.<br>
A motor car (see Figure 1) includes a rear luggage compartment 10 having an upper closure element 12 and a roof 14 with an aperture 18 over the median and rear portions of the passenger compartment 16 which has associated first and second sliding panels 20, 22. It is an advantage if both the panels 20, 22 are made of a transparent material, such as glass or a plastics material, for example.<br>
At each side, the motor car also includes a first guide 24 for the first panel 20 to slide along and a second guide 26 for the second panel 22 to slide along. Each guide 24, 26 is formed by forward'portions 34 and '36 respectively, "fixed to the body and rear portions 3 0 and 32 respectively fixed to a support structure 38. This latter is pivoted by its rear portion about a first axis 40 orthogonal to the longitudinal axis 42 of the car and has actuator means 48 for causing it to rotate about this axis 40. The two portions of each guide 24; 26 are simply positioned next to each other and are not connected in any way, whereby each movable portion 30, 32 is able to be rotated without any hindrance from the respective fixed portions 34, 36.<br>
The structure and manufacturing technique of the guides 24, 26 of the support structure 3 8 and the associated actuator means 48 are known per se and can be manufactured using any method f amiliar to a man skilled in the art; they are therefore not described in detail here. The sliding movement of the panels 20, 22 is also conventional per se and can be controlled either manually or by any type of actuator member.<br><br>
Structures of this type are described, for example, in the documents DE- A-101 21 147 and WO-A-95 29 073.<br>
The motor car also includes a separating member between the luggage compartment 10 and the passenger compartment 16, constituted by a shaped partition 44 pivoted by its lower edge about a second axis 46 orthogonal to the longitudinal axis 42 of the motor car. In alternative embodiments of the invention, which are not illustrated in the drawings, the partition 44 could be mounted slidably. In either case, the partition 44 has operating means, which are known per se, for moving it from a position in which it separates the luggage compartment 10 from the passenger compartment 16, into a position in which the luggage compartment 10 is in communication with the passenger compartment 16', and back again.<br>
The panel's .20, 22 can be positioned (see Figures 1 and 7) in a first configuration closing the aperture 18, in which they are arranged in series along the longitudinal axis 42 of the vehicle, and the front edge 50 of the element 12 for closing the luggage compartment 10 is adj acent the rear edge 52 of the first panel 20 which is in the rearmost position. In this configuration, the motor vehicle has the appearance of a coupe with the first panel 20 acting as rear window and the luggage compartment 10 separated from the passenger compartment 16 by the partition 44 which is in its closed position.<br>
In order to convert the vehicle into its spider configuration, the partition 44 must first be rotated about its. axis 46 (see Figure 2) , thereby placing the luggage compartment  10  in  communication  with  the  passenger<br><br>
compartment 16- The first panel 20 (see Figure 3) and the second panel 22 (see Figure 4) are then slid back on their respective guides 24, 26. When these operations have been completed, the aperture IS is. completely uncovered and the panels 20, 22 are stored one on top of the other on the respective portions 3 0, 32 of the guides 24, 26 which are fixed to the support structure 38.<br>
The respective actuator means then control the support structure 38, with its associated panels 20, 22 (see Figure 5) to rotate downwards about the first axis 40 orthogonal to the longitudinal axis 42, and then control the partition 44 (see Figure 6) to rotate upwards about the second axis 46 orthogonal to the longitudinal axis 42.<br>
The motor car is now in its spider configuration (see Figures 6 and 8), in which the aperture 18 is completely open, with no transverse elements" or the like covering it, while the structure 38 which supports the panels 20, 22 is housed in the upper portion of the luggage compartment 10, beneath the cover element ,12. The luggage compartment 10 is separated from the passenger compartment 16 by the partition 44, in such a way that the aesthetics of the motor car are not spoilt by the panels 20, 22 stored on top of each other in the support structure 38, as these panels 20, 22 cannot be seen.<br>
In order to reconfigure the car as a coup§, one need only carry out the operations described above in the reverse order.<br>
Figures 9, 10 and 11 illustrate a second embodiment of the motor car of the invention, in which the same numbers used<br><br>
with reference to the preceding drawings indicate parts which are the same or equivalent.<br>
The only variation with respect to the first embodiment consists in the fact that additional operating means 54 are provided for varying the spatial position occupied by the first axis 40 of the support structure 38, while maintaining this axis 40 orthogonal to the longitudinal axis 42 of the motor car. These means 54, shown schematically in the drawings, are conventional per se and could be of a mechanical, pneumatic or electrical type, for example.<br>
In this case, the first steps in the transition from the coupe configuration to the spider configuration coincide with those illustrated in Figures 1 to 5. Then,' once the support' structure 38 housing the panels 20, 22 on the respective portions 30, 32 of the guides 24, 26 has been pivoted downwards about the " first axis 4 0, the additional ope'rating means 54 cause (see Figure 10) this axis 40, as well as the structure 38 and all elements associated therewith, to move upwards (along the arrow 56) . In this way the structure 38 is positioned immediately adjacent the lower surface of the closure element 12, thus minimizing the space taken up in the luggage compartment 10. In fact, the useful volume 58 available once the structure 38 has pivoted about the axis 40 is augmented by the additional volume 60 made available by the upward movement of the axis 40 and of the structure 38. Successively, in the same manner as illustrated in Figure 6 with reference to the preceding embodiment, the partition 44 (see Figure 11) is pivoted upwardly about the second axis 46, thus completely separating the luggage compartment 10 from the passenger compartment 16.<br><br>
It is clear that in this case as well, when the car is to be restored to the coupe configuration from the spider configuration, the operations described above need only be<br>
carried out in reverse order.<br>
The spatial movement of the axis 40 can be rectilinear or of any other type, selected so that it is best adapted to the available free space. In any event, this movement makes it possible to increase the useful load space available in the luggage compartment 10 when the motor car is in the spider configuration.<br>
Alternatively, the additional operating means (see the element shown in a broken line 54b in Figure 9) could act directly on the support structure 38, "once this has been released from the- first axis 40. In this way, it would be possible to vary the spatial position of the structure 38 while leaving unchanged that of the first axis 401 The end result would be the same as that described above, that is an increase in the useful load space available in the luggage compartment 10 when the motor car is in the spider configuration.<br>
Naturally, the principle of the invention remaining unchanged, manufacturing details and embodiments can vary widely from those described purely by way of non-limitative example, without departing thereby from the scope of the invention. In particular, the motor car of the invention could have either a single row of seats or a front row and a back row, the number of sliding roof panels could be selected from any number equal to or greater than two, while the upper closure element of the luggage compartment could be either fixed or movable.<br><br><br><br>
