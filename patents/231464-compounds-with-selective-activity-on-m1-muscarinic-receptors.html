				<td>COMPOUNDS WITH SELECTTVE ACTIVITY ON M, MUSCARINIC RECEPTORS<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds which are selective for<br>
muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes, as well as to methods for activating<br>
muscarinic receptors and for treating or alleviating diseases in which modification of<br>
muscarinic receptor activity is beneficial.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Muscarinic acetylcholine rescepters play a central role in the central nervous<br>
system for higher cognitive functions, as well as in the peripheral parasympathetic<br>
nervous system. Cloning has established the presence of five distinct muscarinic<br>
receptor subtypes (termed ml-m5) (cf. T.I. Bonner et al. Science 237, 1987, pp. 527-<br>
532; T.I. Bonner et al., Neuron 1 1988, pp. 403-410). It has been found that ml is the<br>
predominant subtype in the cerebral cortex and is believed to be involved in the<br>
control of cognitive functions. m2 is predominant in heart and is believed to be<br>
involved in the control of hear rate, m3 is believed to be involved in gastrointestinal<br>
and urinary tract stimulation as well as sweating and salivation. m4 is present in brain,<br>
and m5 is present in brain and may be involved certain functions of the central<br>
nervous system associated with the dopaminergic system.<br>
Animal studies of various muscarinic ligands (S. Iversen, Life Sciences 60 (Nos.<br>
13/14), 1997, pp. 1145-1151) have shown that muscarinic compounds have a<br>
profound effect on cognitive functions, e.g. learning and memory. This would suggest<br>
a potential utility of muscarinic agonists in the improvement of cognitive functions in<br>
diseases characterized by cognitive impairment, both age-related (such as Alzheimer's<br>
disease or other dementias) and not age-related (such as attention deficit hyperactivity<br>
disorder).<br>
Based on me presence of r luscarinic receptor subtypes in various tissues, it would<br>
appear that the ml receptor subtype is the more abundant one in the cerebral cortex,<br>
basal ganglia and hippocampus where it accounts for 35-60% of all muscarinic<br>
receptor binding sites (cf. A. Bevey, Proc. Natl. Acad. ScL USA 93, 1996, pp. 13541-<br>
13546). It has been proposed that the ml (and possibly m4) subtype plays a major role<br>
as a postsynaptic muscarinic receptor (located on cholinoceptive neurons in the<br>
neocortex and hippocampus) ir various cognitive and motor functions and is likely to<br>
be a major contributor to the m responses measured in these regions of the brain.<br>
It has previously been foun i that conditions associated with cognitive impairment,<br>
such as Alzheimer's disease 0are accompanied by selective loss of acetylcholine in the<br>
brain. This is believed to be the result of degeneration of cholinergic neurons in the<br>
basal forebrain which innervi .te areas of the association cortex and hippocampus<br>
involved in higher processes (of. S. Iversen, supra). This finding would suggest that<br>
such conditions may be treated or at least ameliorated with drugs that augment the<br>
cholinergic function in the affected areas of the brain.<br>
Treatment with acetylchol ne esterase (AChE) inhibitors such as 9-amino-l,2,3,4-<br>
tetrahydroacridine (tacrine) results in an increase of acetylcholine in the brain which<br>
indirectly causes stimulation of muscarinic receptors. Tacrine treatment has resulted<br>
in a moderate and temporary cognitive improvement in Alzheimer's patients (of. Kasa<br>
et al., supra). On the other hand, tacrine has been found to have cholinergic side<br>
effects due to the periphera acetylcholine stimulation. These include abdominal<br>
cramps, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, weight loss, myopathy and depression.<br>
Gastrointestinal side effects have been observed in about a third of the patients<br>
treated. Tacrine has also beer found to cause significant hepatotoxicity, elevated liver<br>
transaminases having been observed in about 30% of the patients (cf. P. Taylor,<br>
"Anticholinergic Agents". Chapter 8 in Goodman and Gilman: The Pharmacological<br>
Basis of Therapeutics. 9th Ed . 1996, pp. 161-176). The adverse effects of tacrine have<br>
severely limited its clinical utility. Another AChE inhibitor, (R,S)-l-benzyl-4-[5,6-<br>
dimethoxy-l-indanon-2yl]methylpiperidine.HCl (donepezil), has recently been<br>
approved for the treatment of symptoms of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (cf.<br>
P. Kasa et al, supra). No hepatic damage has been observed for this compound but it<br>
has gastrointestinal effects similar to those of tacrine, probably due to stimulation of<br>
the m3 receptor caused by el evated parasympathetic tone.<br>
It has previously been suggested that, since the muscarinic ml receptors in the<br>
prefrontal cortex and hippocampus appear to be intact, it may be possible to remedy<br>
or at least ameliorate the oss of acetylcholine in Alzheimer's disease patients by<br>
administration of drugs ac ing as agonists on those muscarinic receptors (cf. J.H.<br>
Brown and P. Taylor, "Mu carinic Receptor Agonists and Antagonists", Chapter 7 in<br>
Goodman and Gilman: The Pharmc cological Basis of Therapeutics, 9th Ed., 1996, p.<br>
147).<br>
The muscarinic agonists (believed to be ml selective) hitherto suggested for the<br>
treatment of Alzheimer's disease such as arecoline, have not shown greater efficacy<br>
in clinical trials than AChE inhibito s (cf. S.V.P. Jones et al., supra). In one study (cf.<br>
T. Sunderland et al.. Brain Res. Rey. 13. 1988, pp. 371-389), arecoline was found to<br>
have not so much cognitive enhanc ng effects as effects on behavioral changes often<br>
observed in Alzheimer's disease patients, such as a significant increase in motor<br>
activity, significant uplifting of mood, and significant decrease in anergia. However,<br>
presumed ml agonists have later been found to be weak partial agonists selective for<br>
the m2 and/or m3 receptor subtype s (H. Bräuner-Osborne et al., J. Med. Chem. 38,<br>
1995, pp. 2188-2195). As indicated above, m2 subtype selectivity is presumed to be<br>
responsible for the cardiovascular effects observed for these agonists, e.g. tachycardia<br>
and bradycardia, and m3 activ ty is believed to account for the adverse<br>
gastrointestinal effects of the agonits.<br>
m2 and/or m3 activity is therefore a significant drawback for the muscarinic<br>
agonists proposed until now for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, severely<br>
limiting the doses of the drugs which it has been possible to administer to patients<br>
who may therefore have received sub-optimal doses. Furthermore, the lack of subtype<br>
selectivity and low potency of the :urrently tested cholinergic compounds appear to<br>
favor the negative peripheral side effects and have limited cognitive effects because<br>
of weak and/or opposing actions in the brain. It would therefore be of great advantage<br>
to develop compounds which have an improved selectivity for the ml subtype, but<br>
which have little or no activity on the m2 and m3 subtypes.<br>

The present invention fun her provides a method of agonizing a muscarinic<br>
receptor comprising contacting the receptor with an effective amount of a compound<br>
of formula (I), inclusive of all compounds within the scope of formula (I)(i.e.,<br>
including 4-n-Butyl-l-[4-pnenyl-4-oxo-l-butyl]piperidine; 4-M-Butyl-l-[4-(2-<br>

described herein. Exemplary diseases or conditions include neurogenerative disease,<br>
cognitive impairment, age-related cognitive decline or dementia.<br>
The compounds of the present invention have also demonstrated the ability to<br>
reduce intraocular pressure, and therefore can be used in treatment of such diseases as<br>
glaucoma. Glaucoma is a disease in which an abnormality is observed in the<br>
circulation-control mechanism of the aqueous humor filling up the anterior chamber,<br>
i.e., the space formed between the cornea and the lens. This leads to an increase in<br>
the volume of the aquecus humor and an increase in intraocular pressure,<br>
consequently leading to the visual field defect and even to loss of eyesight due to the<br>
compulsion and contraction of the papillae of the optic nerve.<br>
The compounds of the present invention preferably show selective agonist activity<br>
towards the ml receptor. S ich an agonist is defined as a compound that increases the<br>
activity of the ml muscarine receptor when it contacts the receptor. Selectivity is<br>
defined as a property of a muscarinic ml agonist whereby an amount of agonist<br>
effective to increase the ac ivity of the ml receptor causes little or no increase in the<br>
activity of the m3 and m5 s abtypes, and preferably the m2 and m4 subtypes.<br>

The present invention inluces within its scope prodrugs of the compounds of this<br>
invention. In general, such prodrugs are inactive derivatives of the compounds of this<br>
invention which are readily convertible in vivo into the required compound.<br>
Conventional procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable prodrug<br>
derivatives are described, for example, in "Design of Prodrugs," ed. H. Bundgaard,<br>
Elsevier, 1985. Metabolites of these compounds include active species produced upon<br>
introduction of compounds of this invention into the biological milieu.<br>
Where the compounds according to the invention have at least one chiral center,<br>
they may exist as a racemate or as enantiomers. It should be noted that all such<br>
isomers and mixtures thereof are included in the scope of the present invention.<br>
Furthermore, some of the crystalline forms for compounds of the present invention<br>
may exist as polymorphs and as such are intended to be included in the present<br>
invention. In addition, some of' the compounds of the present invention may form<br>
solvates with water (i.e., hydrates) or common organic solvents. Such solvates are<br>
also included in the scope of th is invention.<br>
Where the processes for the preparation of the compounds according to the<br>
invention give rise to mixtures of stereoisomers, such isomers may be separated by<br>
conventional techniques such as preparative chiral chromatography. The compounds<br>
may be prepared in racemic form. or individual enantiomers may be prepared either<br>
by stereoselective synthesis o by resolution. The compounds may, for example, be<br>
resolved into their component enantiomers by standard techniques, such as the<br>
formation of diastereomeric pairs by salt formation with an optically active acid, such<br>
as (-)-di-p-toluoyl-d-tartaric acid and/or (+)-di-p-toluoyl-l-tartaric acid followed by<br>
fractional crystallization and egeneration of the free base. The compounds may also<br>
be resolved by formation of diastereomeric esters or amides, followed by<br>
chromatographic separation and removal of the chiral auxiliary.<br>
During any of the processes for preparation of the compounds of the present<br>
invention, it may be necessarv and/or desirable to protect sensitive or reactive groups<br>
on any of the molecules comcemed. This may be achieved by means of conventional<br>
protecting groups, such as those described in Protective groups in Organic Chemistry,<br>
ed. J.F.W. McOmie, Plenun Press, 1973; and T.W. Greene &amp; P.G.M. Wuts,<br>
Protective groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1991. The protecting<br>
groups may be removed at a convenient subsequent stage using methods known from<br>
the art.<br>
Compounds of the presert invention may be administered in any of the foregoing<br>
compositions and according to dosage regimens established in the art whenever<br>
specific pharmacological modification of the activity of muscarinic receptors is<br>
required.<br>
The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising one<br>
or more compounds of the invention together with a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
diluent or excipient. Preferably such compositions are in unit dosage forms such as<br>
tablets, pills, capsules (including sustained-release or delayed-release formulations)<br>
powders, granules, elixirs, tinctures, syrups and emulsions, sterile parenteral solutions<br>
or suspensions, aerosol or iquid sprays, drops, ampoules, auto-injector devices or<br>
suppositories; for oral, parenteral (e.g. intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous),<br>
intranasal, sublingual or rectal administration, or for administration by inhalation or<br>
insufflation, and may be formulated in an appropriate manner and in accordance with<br>
accepted practices such as those disclosed in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences.<br>
Gennaro, Ed., Mack Publishing Co.. Easton PA, 1990. Alternatively, the compositions<br>
may be in sustained-release form suitable for once-weekly or once-monthly<br>
administration; for example, an insoluble salt of the active compound, such as the<br>
decanoate salt, may be adapted to provide a depot preparation for intramuscular<br>
injection. The present invention also contemplates providing suitable topical<br>
formulations for administration t.o. e.g. eye or skin or mucosa.<br>
For instance, for oral administration in the form of a tablet or capsule, the active<br>
drug component can be combined with an oral non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
inert carrier such as ethanol, glycerol, water and the like. Moreover, when desired or<br>
necessary, suitable binders, ubricants. disintegrating agents, flavoring agents and<br>
coloring agents can also be incorporated into the mixture. Suitable binders include,<br>
without limitation, starch, gelatin, natural sugars such as glucose or beta-lactose,<br>
natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, tragacanth or sodium alginate,<br>
carboxymethylcellulose, polyethylene glycol, waxes and the like. Lubricants used in<br>
these dosage forms include, without limitation, sodium oleate, sodium stearate,<br>
magnesium stearate, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium chloride and the like.<br>
Disintegrators include, without limitation, starch, methyl cellulose, agar, bentonite.<br>
xanthan gum and the like.<br>
For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the active ingredient is mixed<br>
with a suitable pharmaceutic a. excipient, e.g. such as the ones described above, and<br>
other pharmaceutical diluent., e.g. water, to form a solid preformulation composition<br>
containing a homogeneous mixture of a compound of the present invention, or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. By the term "homogeneous" is meant that<br>
the active ingredient is dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the<br>
composition may be readily subdivided into equally effective unit dosage forms such<br>
as tablets, pills and capsules. The solid preformulation composition may then be<br>
subdivided into unit dosage forms of the type described above containing from 0J to<br>
about 50 mg of the active ingredient of the present invention. The tablets or pills of<br>
the present composition may be coated or otherwise compounded to provide a dosage<br>
form affording the advantage of prolonged action. For example, the tablet or pill can<br>
comprise an inner core contuining the active compound and an outer layer as a coating<br>
surrounding the core. The ofter coating may be an enteric layer which serves to resist<br>
disintegration in the stomach and permits the inner core to pass intact into the<br>
duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of materials can be used for such<br>
enteric layers or coatings, such materials including a number of polymeric acids and<br>
mixtures of polymeric acids with, conventional materials such as shellac, cetyl alcohol<br>
and cellulose acetate.<br>
The liquid forms in which the present compositions may be incorporated for<br>
administration orally or by injection include aqueous solutions, suitably flavored<br>
syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions, and flavored emulsions with edible oils such as<br>
cottonseed oil, sesame oil. coconut oil or peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar<br>
pharmaceutical carriers. Suitable dispersing or suspending agents for aqueous<br>
suspensions include synthetic and natural gums such as tragacanth, acacia, alginate,<br>
dextran, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, gelatin. methylcellulose or<br>
polyvinyl-pyrrolidone. Other. dispersing agents which may be employed include<br>
glycerin and the like. For pa enteral administration, sterile suspensions and solutions<br>
are desired. Isotonic preparations which generally contain suitable preservatives are<br>
employed when intravenous administration is desired. The compositions can also be<br>
formulated as an ophthalmi: solution or suspension formation, i.e., eye drops, for<br>
ocular administration<br>
Consequently, the present invention also relates to a method of alleviating or<br>
treating a disease or condition in which modification of muscarinic receptor activity,<br>
in particular ml receptor activity, has a beneficial effect by administering a<br>
therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the present invention to a subject<br>
in need of such treatment. Such diseases or conditions may, for instance arise from<br>
inadequate stimulation or activation of muscarinic receptors. It is anticipated that by<br>
using compounds which are selective for a particular muscarinic receptor subtype, in<br>
particular ml, the problems with adverse side effects observed with the known<br>
muscarinic drugs, such as achycardia or bradycardia or gastrointestinal effects, may<br>
substantially be avoided.<br>
The term "subject," as used herein refers to an animal, preferably a mammal, most<br>
preferably a human, who has been the object of treatment, observation or experiment.<br>
The term "therapeutically effective amount" as used herein means that amount or<br>
active compound or pharmaceutical agent that elicits the biological or medicinal<br>
response in a tissue, system, animal or human that is being sought by a researcher,<br>
veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician, which includes alleviation of the<br>
symptoms of the disease being treated.<br>
Preferably, compounds of general formula I exhibit subtype selectivity for the<br>
muscarinic ml receptor subtype Likewise, the compounds exhibit selectivity for the<br>
muscarinic ml receptor subtype compared to other human G-protein coupled<br>
receptors tested including serotonin, histamine, dopamine or adrenergic receptors.<br>
One important implication of this selectivity is that these compounds may be effective<br>
in the treatment or amelioration of a number of diseases and disorders of the central<br>
nervous system without the undesirable side effects previously observed with non-<br>
selective compounds.<br>
The ability of the compounds of the present invention to demonstrate muscarinic<br>
ml receptor subtype selectivity makes them potentially very useful in treating a<br>
number of diseases and disorders characterized by cognitive impairment such as<br>
attention deficit disorder, 01 neurodegenerative diseases, e.g. Alzheimer's disease,<br>
other forms of age-related cognitive decline, e.g. senile dementia, or dementia-related<br>
symptoms such as decreased motor activity, mood changes, anergia. apathy,<br>
restlessness and aggressive behavior. It is currently believed that the muscarinic ml<br>
receptor may also be involved in control of intraocular pressure, and that muscarinic<br>
ml agonists may therefore be used to treat or alleviate ocular diseases such as<br>
glaucoma.<br>
Advantageously, compounds of the present invention may be administered in a<br>
single daily dose, or the total daily dosage may be administered in divided doses two.<br>
three or four times daily. Furthermore, compounds for the present invention may be<br>
administered in intranasal form via topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles, or via<br>
transdermal routes, using those forms of transdermal skin patches well known to<br>
persons skilled in the art. To be administered in the form of a transdermal delivery<br>
system, the dosage administration will, of course, be continuous rather than<br>
intermittent throughout the iosage regimen.<br>
The dosage regimen utilizing the compounds of the present invention is selected<br>
in accordance with a variety of factors including type, species, age, weight, sex and<br>
medical condition of the patient; the severity of the condition to be treated; the route<br>
of administration; the renal and hepatic function of the patient; and the particular<br>
compound employed. A physician or veterinarian of ordinary skill can readily<br>
determine and prescribe the effective amount of the drug required to prevent, counter<br>
or arrest the progress of the disease or disorder which is being treated.<br>
The daily dosage of the products may be varied over a wide range from 0.01 to<br>
100 mg per adult human pe: day. For oral administration, the compositions are<br>
preferably provided in the form of tablets containing 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0.<br>
10.0, 15.0, 25.0 or 50.0 mg of the active ingredient for the symptomatic adjustment of<br>
the dosage to the patient to be reated. A unit dose typically contains from about 0.001<br>
mg to about 50 mg of the active ingredient, preferably from about 1 mg to about 10<br>
mg of active ingredient. An effective amount of the drug is ordinarily supplied at a<br>
dosage level of from about 0.0001 mg/kg to about 25 mg/kg of body weight per day.<br>
Preferably, the range is from aoout 0.001 to 10 mg/kg of body weight per day, and<br>
especially from about 0.001 mg/kg to 1 mg/kg of body weight per day. The<br>
compounds may be administered on a regimen of 1 to 4 times per day.<br>
Compounds according to the present invention may be used alone at appropriate<br>
dosages defined by routine tt sting in order to obtain optimal pharmacological effect<br>
on a muscarinic receptor, in particular the muscarinic ml receptor subtype, while<br>
minimizing any potential toxic or otherwise unwanted effects. In addition,<br>
co-administration or sequent ial administration of other agents which improve the<br>
effect of the compound may, in some cases, be desirable.<br>
The pharmacological properties and the selectivity of the compounds of this<br>
invention for specific muscarinic receptor subtypes may be demonstrated by a number<br>
of different assay methods ising recombinant receptor subtypes, preferably of the<br>
human receptors if these are ivailable, e.g. conventional second messenger or binding<br>
assays. A particularly converiem functional assay system is the receptor selection and<br>
amplification assay disclosed in US 5,707.798 describing a method of screening for<br>
bioactive compounds by utilizing the ability of cells transfected with receptor DNA,<br>
e.g. coding for the differeni muscarinic subtypes, to amplify in the presence of a<br>
ligand of the receptor. Cell unplification is detected as increased levels of a marker<br>
also expressed by the cells.<br>
The invention is disclosed in further detail in the following examples which are<br>
not in any way intended to limit the scope of the invention as claimed.<br>
Examples<br>
Example I - 4-n-Butyl-l-f4-(2-methylphenyl)-4-oxo-l-butylJpiperidine (5)<br>
l-Benzyl-4-n-butylidenepipendine (2). A 500 mL 3-necked flask fitted with a<br>
stirrer, was charged with sodium hydride (1.61 g, 67 mmol) and DMSO (40 mL). The<br>
resulting suspension was heated to 90°C for 30 min, until the evolution of hydrogen<br>
ceased. The suspension was cooled on an ice-bath for 20 min followed by addition of<br>
a slurry of butyltriphenylphospnomum bromide (26.6 g, 67 mmol) in DMSO (70 mL).<br>
The red mixture was stirred for 15 min at rt. l-Benzyl-4-piperidone 1 (14.0 g, 74<br>
mmol) was slowly added over 30 min. and the mixture was stirred at room<br>
temperature over night. H2O (200 mL) was added to the reaction mixture followed by<br>
extraction with heptane (4 x 100 mL) and ethyl acetate (2 x 100 mL). The combined<br>
organic phases were dried and evaporated to dryness, producing 38.1 g of a yellow<br>
oil. The oil was distilled to give 14.9 g (88 %) of 2, bp 101-105°C (0.1 mm Hg). 1H<br>
NMR (CDC13) 0.90-0.95 (1, 3H), 1.25-1.41 (m, 2H), 1.90-2.20 (m, 2H), 2.18-2.30<br>
(m, 4H), 2.40-2.45 (m, 4H), :.50 (s, 2H), 5.17 (t, 1H), 7.20-7.42 (m, 5H).<br>
4-n-Butylpiperidine (3). It a 500 mL flask fitted with a stirrer was added a slurry<br>
of 2 (13.2 g, 58 mmol) and 10% palladium on charcoal (1.2 g) in ethanol (70 mL),<br>
followed by addition of concentrated hydrochloric acid (1.5 mL). The reaction flask<br>
was evacuated and hydroget was added via a reaction flask. A total of 2.5 dm3 of<br>
hydrogen was consumed. The reaction mixture was filtered and evaporated and the<br>
residue was dissolved in H20 (40 mL) and NaOH (20 mL, 2 M) followed by<br>
extraction with ethyl acetae (3 x 100 mL). The combined organic phases were<br>

Example XVI - Screening of test compounds in an assay using muscarinic<br>
receptor subtypes ml, ml, mi, m4 and mS<br>
Transfection of cells -with muscarinic receptor DNAs (general procedure) NIH<br>
3T3 cells (available from the Amercan Type Culture Collection as ATCC CRL 1658)<br>
were grown at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere (5% C02) incubator in Dulbeccos<br>
modified Eagle's medium (DMEvf) supplemented with 4.5 g/1 glucose, 4 raM<br>
glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 5D units/ml streptomycin (available from Advanced<br>
Biotechnologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) and 10% calf serum (available from Sigma,<br>
St. Louis, MI). The cells were treated with trypsin-EDTA, spun down and plated at<br>
2xl06 per 15 cm dish in 20 mi of D vIEM containing 10% calf serum.<br>
The ml-m5 muscarinic receptor subtypes were cloned substantially as described<br>
by Bonner et al., Science 257,1987 p. 527, and Bonner et al., Neuron 1,1988. p. 403.<br>
For the m2 and m4 receptors, the cells were co-transfected with DNA encoding a<br>
chimera between the Gq protein and the five carboxy-terminal amino acids of the Gi<br>
protein (the Gq-i5 construct is described by Conklin et al., Nature 363,1993, p.274).<br>
On day one. the cells were transfected using the Superfect transfection reagent<br>
(available from Qiagen, Valen:ia, CA) in accordance with the manufacturer's<br>
instructions. Receptor DNA, 3-gal DNA (pSI-P-galactosidase available from<br>
Promega, Madison , WI), chimeric Gq-i5 DNA for the m2 and m4 receptor subtype<br>
assays, and salmon sperm DNA (available from Sigma, St. Louis, MI) as filler to a<br>
total of 20 ug DNA was addec per plate. Prior to addition to the plates, 60 ul<br>
Superfect was added to the DNA and mixed thoroughly by pipetting up and down<br>
several times. The mixture was intubated at room temperature for 10-15 minutes. The<br>
media were aspirated, and 12 m fresh DMEM containing 10% calf serum and 50<br>
units/ml penicillin/streptomycin was added to the plates. The DNA-Superfect solution<br>
was mixed once more with a pipette and added to the plate which was swirled to<br>
distribute the DNA mixture, evthly over the surface. The cells were incubated<br>
overnight at 37°C and 5% C02.<br>
After incubation, the media wt:re aspirated and the plates were rinsed once with a<br>
15 ml volume of Hank's Buffered Saline. The plates were swirled to ensure thorough<br>
rinsing. 20 ml fresh DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum and 50 units/ml<br>
penicillin/streptomycin was added to the plates. The cells were incubated for 24-48<br>
hours until the plates were 100% confluent.<br>
Assay of NIH 3T3 cells transacted with muscarinic receptor subtypes (general<br>
procedure) DMEM containing 2Vo Cyto-SF3 was heated at 37°C in a water bath<br>
under sterile conditions. Sterile working stock solutions of test compounds to be<br>
assayed were prepared by diluting the compounds in DMEM to 8x the final<br>
concentration for testing. The compound (carbachol) to be included in the assay as a<br>
positive control was also diluted ir DMEM to 8x the final concentration. 50 ^1 of the<br>
DMEM containing 2% Cyto-SF3 was added to each well of 96-well microtiter plates<br>
under sterile conditions. Then, 16 fj.1 of compound solutions were added to the top<br>
wells of the plates, and dilution of the solutions was performed by taking 16 ul of the<br>
compound solutions from the top v/ells and pipetting them into the next row of wells.<br>
This procedure was repeated with each subsequent row of wells, except that 50 ul<br>
medium alone was added to the baseline control wells (the wells that contain medium<br>
and cells, but not test compounds) and plate control wells (wells containing medium,<br>
but not test compounds and cells). The plates were then placed in an incubator at 37°C<br>
to equilibrate temperature and pH.<br>
When the cell cultures had reached 100% confluence, the medium was aspirated<br>
and each plate was rinsed with 15 ml Hank's Buffered Saline (HBS), The cells were<br>
left in the incubator for about 10-15 minutes until the HBS had turned slightly yellow.<br>
The HBS was then aspirated and ml trypsin was added to each plate and swirled so<br>
as to completely cover the plates. The edges of the plates were gently rapped several<br>
times to loosen the cells. After the cells had been dislodged from the surface, 8 ml<br>
DMEM containing 10% calf serum and 50 units/ml penicillin and 50 units/ml<br>
streptomycin was added to inhibit the trypsin. The plates were rinsed with this<br>
medium, and the cells were pipetted into a tube. The cells were centrifuged at 1000<br>
rpm for 5-10 min. in an IEC Centra CL2 centrifuge (produced by Sorvall).<br>
Afterwards, the medium was caref ally aspirated so as not to dislodge the cells. The<br>
cell pellet was suspended in 1600 ul DMEM containing 10% calf serum and 50<br>
units/ml penicillin and 50 units, ml streptomycin, after which 20 ml DMEM<br>
supplemented with 2% Cyto-SF3 was added. 50 μ1 aliquots of this cell suspension<br>
was added to the wells of the 96-well microtiter plates prepared above (except for the<br>
plate control wells). The plates were then incubated for 4 days at 37°C and 5% CO2.<br>
After incubation, the medium was removed by inverting the microtiter plates and<br>
shaking them gently, after which they were blotted on absorbent paper. 100 ul<br>
chromogenic substrate (3.5 mM o-nitrophenyl-β-D-gaiactopyranoside, 0.5% Nonidet<br>
NP-40, in phosphate buffered salinei was added to each well, and the plates were<br>
incubated at 30°C until the optimum absorbance at 405 nm was obtained. The<br>
asborbance of the baseline and plate control wells were subtracted from all values.<br>
Results Using the general procedure described above, NIH 3T3 cells were co-<br>
transfected with DNAs encoding the ml, m3 and m5 receptor subtypes. A compound<br>
library containing approximately 15,000 small organic compounds (1 per well) was<br>
screened against the receptors by the procedures described above. Fig. \ illustrates<br>
data from one 96-well plate from the screen. On this plate, two compounds were<br>
active at one or more of the traisfected receptors. In the total screen, four related<br>
compounds were identified that showed activity. To determine which of the receptors<br>
were activated in the screen, the compounds were tested as described above against<br>
each of the receptors transfected into separate cell cultures. Compound A only<br>
activated the ml receptor subtype, at which it was a potent partial agonist, inducing a<br>
lower maximal response than the reference compound carbachol.<br>
In further experiments, the our compounds were found to selectively activate the<br>
ml receptor with no significant activity at the m2. m3, m4 or m5 muscarinic<br>
receptors. The most active compound, compound A, was not an antagonist of<br>
carbachol-induced responses of the five muscarinic receptor subtypes.<br>
Compound A was further lested for agonist activity against several other receptors<br>
at the a-adrenergic receptor subtypes 1D, 1B, 1A, 2A, 2B and 2C, the histamine H1<br>
and the serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A subtypes. The compound showed no<br>
significant activity in these assays. In antagonist experiments, compound A did not<br>
inhibit responses of the α-adrenergic receptor subtypes 2A, 2B or 2C, or the serotonin<br>
receptor subtypes 5-HT1A or 5-HT2A. As illustrated in Figure 2. the responses<br>
induced by compound A were blocked by the muscarinic antagonist atropine with the<br>
same potency as were resporses induced by the muscarinic agonist carbachol.<br>
Example XVII - RSATAssay<br>
R-SAT assays (see U.S patent no. 5,707,798. incorporated herein by reference)<br>
were carried out where cells transfected with ml, m3 or m5 receptors were exposed to<br>
