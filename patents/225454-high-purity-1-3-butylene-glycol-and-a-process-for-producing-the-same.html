1,3-Butylene Glycol of High Purity, Process for<br>
Producing 1,3-Butylene Glycol, and Process for Producing<br>
Butanol as a By-Product and Butyl Acetate<br>
Technical Field<br>
In the present invention, a first invention group<br>
relates to 1,3-butylene glycol of high purity, which, at<br>
a (period of three months after production, exhibits<br>
potassium permanganate color-fading time of at least<br>
five minutes as measured according to JIS K1351 3.10,<br>
and which issues no odor and undergoes minimal change in<br>
quality with passage of time. A second invention group<br>
relates to a process for producing purified a 1,3-<br>
butylene glycol, characterized by hydrogenating<br>
acetaldols in the presence of a catalyst for<br>
hydrogenation having a specific activity. The purified<br>
1,3-butylene glycol issues a slight odor or no odor. A<br>
third invention group relates to a process for producing<br>
1,3-butylene glycol by hydrogenating, in the presence of<br>
a catalyst, acetaldols under acidic condition's. A<br>
fourth invention group relates to a process for<br>
purifying 1,3-butylene glycol, in which a crude reaction<br>
mixture obtained through hydrogenation of acetaldols in<br>
the presence of a catalyst is basified, and alcohols are<br>
removed from the mixture. Further, a fifth invention<br>
group relates to a process for producing a purified 1,3-<br>
butylene glycol, characterized by subjecting 1,3-<br>
butylene glycol to an ozone, treatment after high-<br>
boiling-point components are removed in the form of<br>
residue in tower bottom. The purified 1,3-butylene<br>
glycol issues a significantly reduced odor, and is<br>
suitable as, for example, a raw material for cosmetics.<br>
Still further, a sixth invention group relates to a<br>
process for producing butanol as a by-product (in the<br>
present invention, the butanol refers to n-butanol) by<br>
hydrogenating crotonaldehyde which is by-produced during<br>
synthesis of acetaldols; and to a process for producing<br>
butyl acetate from the butanol.<br>
Background Art<br>
1,3-Butylene glycol is a viscous, colorless,<br>
transparent, odorless liquid having a boiling point of<br>
208Oc, exhibits high solubility, and produces<br>
derivatives having excellent chemical stability.<br>
1,3-Butylene glycol is used. as a raw material of<br>
various synthetic resins and surfactants. In addition,<br>
since 1,3-butylene glycol has excellent hygroscopicity,<br>
low volatility, and low toxicity, it is also used as a<br>
material for cosmetics, hygroscopic agents, high-<br>
boiling-point solvents, and antifreezes. Particularly,<br>
in recent years, there has been increasing a demand for<br>
a non-toxic, non-irritant 1,3-butylene glycol in the<br>
cosmetic industry, since tne butylene glycol has<br>
excellent properties as a humectant. Thus, an odorless<br>
butylene glycol is useful as a material of cosmetic<br>
grade.<br>
However, when stored in a tank, 1,3-butylene glycol<br>
produced through a conventional process deteriorates<br>
with passage of time and issues a slight odor, and thus,<br>
long-term storage of the butylene glycol has been<br>
difficult.<br>
Therefore, there has been a demand for providing an<br>
odorless 1,3-butylene glycol and which does not issue<br>
even a slight odor after storage for a long period of<br>
time.<br>
Conventionally, the following three production<br>
processes for 1,3-butylene glycol have been known:<br>
process for producing 1,3-butylene glycol in which<br>
acetaldehyde is subjected to aldol condensation to<br>
thereby yield acetaldos, followed bv catalytic<br>
reduction of the acetaldols.(UK Patent No. 853266);<br>
a process for producing 1,3-butylene glycol through a<br>
hydration reaction of 1,3-butylene oxide; and (III) a<br>
process for producing 1,3-butylene glycol from propylene<br>
and formaldehyde through the Prins reaction.<br>
However, the process (II). is not practical, since<br>
an industrial production process therefor has not yet<br>
been established. Also, the process (III) is not<br>
practical because of a low yield.<br>
Industrially, 1,3-butylene glycol is produced<br>
through the process (I). However, since acetaldols are<br>
a structurally unstable substance, and produces<br>
crotonaldehyde through dehydration, a variety of<br>
impurities such as butanol and 2-butanone are bv-<br>
produced during a hydrogenation step (hereinafter,<br>
abbreviated as hydrogenation). Furthermore, in a step<br>
for recovering and recycling acetaldehyde, acetaldols<br>
are reacted with, for example, acetaldehyde,. to thereby<br>
produce a variety of impurities. Separation of such<br>
impurities is difficult during a step for purifying 1,3-<br>
butylene glycol through, for example, distillation, and<br>
the impurities adversely affect the quality,<br>
particularly odor, of a product, for example, a product<br>
for cosmetics in particular.<br>
Japanese latent Application Laid-Open (kokai) No.<br>

hydroxypropyl)-4-methyl-1,3-dioxane-6-ol), in which<br>
acetaldehyde is subjected to aldol condensation in the<br>
presence of an alkali catalyst, to thereby yield a crude<br>
reaction mixture containing aldoxane (trivial name of<br>
2,4-dimethyl-1,3-dioxane-6-ol), and the aldoxane is<br>
thermally decomposed while acetaldehyde is obtained as a<br>
distillate.<br>

glycol, in which 1,3-butylene glycol having a purity of<br>
98% or more is continuously distilled and purified under<br>
reduced pressure by use of a thin-film evaporator, while<br>
water is added to the butylene glycol.<br>
Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (kokai) No.<br>
63-156738 discloses a process for distilling and<br>
purifying 1,3-butylene glycol, in which a hydrogenation<br>
reaction mixture of acetaldol is promptly subjected to<br>
flash evaporation under reduced pressure in advance, and<br>
the hydrogenation reaction mixture is subjected to<br>
distillation for removing high-boiling-point substances,<br>
and then to distillation for removing low-boiling-point<br>
substances, to thereby produce 1,3-butylene glycol as a<br>
bottom product.<br>
Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (kokai) No.<br>
6-329664 discloses a process for producing a crude<br>
reaction mixture predominantly containing aldoxane and<br>
paraldol, in which, when acetaldehyde is subjected to<br>
aldol condensation in the presence of an alkali catalyst<br>
to thereby produce a crude reaction mixture<br>
predominantly containing aldoxane, acetaldehyde, water,<br>
and a small amount of crotonaldehyde, and then the<br>
aldoxane is thermally decomposed to thereby produce a<br>
crude reaction mixture predominantly containing the<br>
aldoxane and paraldol, acetaldehyde obtained as a<br>
distillate from the top of a thermal decomposition tower<br>
during thermal decomposition of the aldoxane is purified<br>
by use of a distillation tower including a side cut line<br>
having a decanter, and acetaldehyde substantially not<br>
containing crotonaldehyde is recycled in the aldol<br>
condensation step; and a process for producing 1,3-<br>
butylene glycol from the crude reaction mixture.<br>
Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (kokai) No.<br>
7-258129 discloses a process for distilling and<br>
purifying 1,3-butylene glycol from a reaction mixture<br>
obtained through liquid-phase hydrogen reduction of<br>
acetaldol, in which, when 1,3-butylene glycol is<br>
subjected to distillation for removing high-boiling-<br>
point substances, at least one compound selected from<br>
the group consisting of sodium hydroxide, potassium<br>
hydroxide, sodium borohydride, and potassium borohydride<br>
is added to the reaction mixture.<br>
US Patent No. 3489655 discloses a process for<br>
improving the odor of 1,3-butylene glycol through a<br>
specific distillation process, in which heated 1,3-<br>
butylene glycol is brought into contact with only a non-<br>
catalytic material; specifically, stainless steel or<br>
glass.<br>
However, the thus-produced odorless 1,3-butylene<br>
glycol involves a problem in that the butylene glycol<br>
deteriorates with passage of time and issues a slight<br>
odor when stored for a long period of time. Since a<br>
solution fed into a tower for removing high-boiling-<br>
point substances contains large amounts of high-boiling-<br>
point substances, through addition of an alkali metal,<br>
although the amount of low-boiling-point substances<br>
which are responsible for odor is reduced,<br>
simultaneously the high-boiling-point substances are<br>
decomposed to thereby yield low-boiling-point substances.<br>
It is to be noted that substances causing odor can be<br>
consequently reduced but only to a certain limited<br>
amount, and thus the butylene glycol deteriorates as<br>
time elapses, to thereby issue a slight odor when stored<br>
for a long period of time.<br>
As described above, the conventional techniques are<br>
unsatisfactory for producing, at high yield and low cost<br>
1,3-butylene glycol which issues a considerably reduced<br>
odor after being stored for a long period of time, or<br>
1,3-butylene glycol of high purify.<br>
Meanwhile, butyl acetate is widely used as, for<br>
example, a solvent. Known production processes for<br>
butyl acetate include a process for distilling and<br>
purifying butyl acetate obtained through esterification<br>
of acetic acid and butanol in the presence of an acid<br>
catalyst.<br>
Known production processes for butanol serving as a<br>
raw material include (i) the Hoechst-Wacker process, in<br>
which acetaldol is synthesized through dimerization of<br>
acetaldehyde and subjected to dehydration, to thereby<br>
yield crotonaldehyde, and then the crotonaldehyde is<br>
hydrogenated (hereinafter, occasionally also referred to<br>
hydrogenation) ; and (ii) the Reppe process, in which<br>
propylene, carbon monoxide, and water are reacted with<br>
one another in the presence of a catalyst.<br>
On the other hand, when acetaldols are synthesized<br>
through condensation of acetaldehyde, and the acetaldols<br>
are hydrogenated, to thereby produce 1,3-butylene glycol,<br>
crotonaldehyde is by-produced during the synthesis step<br>
of the acetaldols. Therefore, there has been studied a<br>
process for producing butyl acetate from butanol which<br>
is by-produced through hydrogenation of the by-produced<br>
crotonaldehyde.<br>
However, through the aforementioned techniques,<br>
production of butanol, or butyl acetate, having a<br>
quality comparable with that of a commercially available<br>
product is difficult, since the chameleon test value or<br>
the sulfuric acid coloring test value of butanol is low<br>
due to impurities contained in by-produced butanol.<br>
Accordingly, the first invention group provides<br>
1,3-butylene glycol of high purity which, at a period of<br>
three months after production, issues a considerably<br>
reduced odor, and which undergoes minimal change in<br>
quality with passage of time. The second invention<br>
group provides a process for producing, reliably and at<br>
high production efficiency, 1,3-butylene glycol which<br>
does not issue any problematic odor immediately after<br>
production and after three months of storage. The third<br>
invention group provides a process for producing 1,3-<br>
butylene glycol at high yield, in which corrosion of an<br>
apparatus employed in a hydrogenation step is minimized.<br>
The fourth invention group provides a high-yield,<br>
economical purification process for providing 1,3-<br>
butylene glycol of high purity. Further, the fifth<br>
invention group provides a high-yield, economical<br>
process for producing purified 1,3-butylene glycol which<br>
issues no odor or issues only a considerably reduced<br>
odor.<br>
Furthermore, the sixth invention group provides a<br>
process for producing, as a by-product, butanol<br>
containing small amounts of impurities, in which, when<br>
acetaldol is hydrogenated to thereby produce 1,3-<br>
butylene glycol, crotonaldehyde which is by-produced<br>
during synthesis of the acetaldols is simultaneously<br>
hydrogenated, to thereby allow butanol to be by-produced,<br>
and the by-produced butanol is purified; and a process<br>
for producing butyl acetate of high quality from the<br>
thus-obtained butanol.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
In order to solve the aforementioned problems, the<br>
present inventors have performed extensive studies, and<br>
have found that, when 1,3-butylene glycol is produced<br>
such that the 1,3-butylene glycol exhibits potassium<br>
permanganate color-fading time of at least five minutes<br>
as measured according to JIS K1351 3.10, the odor of the<br>
1,3-butylene glycol is considerably reduced, and the<br>
1,3-butylene glycol undergoes a minimal change in<br>
quality with passage of time, to thereby accomplish the<br>
inventions belonging to the first invention group.<br>
The present inventors have found that, when<br>
acetaldols are hydrogenated in the presence of a<br>
catalyst of high activity, the amount of the aldehyde<br>
groups remaining in the resultant crude mixture<br>
(referred to as "hydrogenation crude mixture")—the<br>
aldehyde groups being considered to be a substance<br>
responsible for odor—can be considerably reduced, to<br>
thereby accomplish the inventions belonging to the<br>
second invention group.<br>
The present inventors have found that, when<br>
acetaldols obtained through condensation of acetaldehyde<br>
in the presence of a basic catalvst are hvdroaenated in<br><br>
the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst and under<br>
acidic conditions, the aforementioned problems can be<br>
solved, to thereby accomplish the inventions belonging<br>
to the third invention group.<br>
The present inventors have found that, when a crude<br>
mixture obtained through hydrogenation of acetaldols<br>
(the mixture may be referred to as "hydrogenation crude<br>
mixture")—the mixture containing aldehyde—is basified<br>
and subjected to distillation, the aforementioned<br>
problems can be solved, to thereby accomplish the<br>
inventions belonging to the fourth invention group.<br>
Further, the present inventors have found that,<br>
when a crude mixture obtained through hydrogenation of<br>
acetaldols (the mixture may be referred to as<br>
"hydrogenation crude mixture")—the mixture containing<br>
aldehyde—is subjected to distillation to thereby<br>
separate low-boiling-point components (L), the resultant<br>
mixture is further subjected to distillation to thereby<br>
yield 1,3-butylene glycol as a distillate, and then the<br>
1,3-butylene glycol distillate (D) is treated with ozone,<br>
there can be produced a purified 1, 3-butylene glycol<br>
which issues a considerably reduced odor or no odor (the<br>
glycol may be referred to as "a final product") at high<br>
yield and economically, to thereby accomplish the<br>
inventions belonging to the fifth invention group.<br>
Still further, the present inventors have performed<br>
studies on the basis of the presumption that, in a<br><br>
process for producing butanol as a by-product, when by-<br>
produced crotonaldehyde is hydrogenated during<br>
production of 1,3-butylene glycol through hydrogenation<br>
of acetaldols, hydrogenation of the crotonaldehyde does<br>
not proceed completely, and reducing substances remain<br>
in a hydrogenation crude mixture, whereby the product<br>
quality of butanol, as a result, butyl acetate is<br>
lowered, since such impurities cannot be separated in a<br>
conventional distillation step for purifying the by-<br>
produced butanol, and a small amount of the impurities<br>
are contained in a purified butanol. As a result, the<br>
present inventors have found that, when purification and<br>
a chemical treatment of by-produced butanol are carried<br>
out in combination, the butanol is effectively purified,<br>
to thereby accomplish the inventions belonging to the<br>
sixth invention group.<br>
Accordingly, the first invention group provides a<br>

Best Mode for carrying out the Invention<br>
Embodiments of the first through sixth invention<br>
groups will next be described in detail. The following<br>
descriptions are common to the invention groups.<br>
Acetaldols<br>
Acetaldehyde, when condensed in the presence of a<br>
base such as sodium hydroxide, produces predominant<br>
component acetaldols, and further produces, upon<br>
dehydration of acetaldols, crotonaldehyde and other<br>
impurities as by-products. Acetaldols refer to a<br>
class of compounds which produce 1,3-butylene glycol<br><br>
through hydrogenation. Specific Examples of the<br>
acetaldols include acetaldol; paraldol which is a cyclic<br>
dimer thereof; aldoxane which is a cyclic trimer of<br>
acetaldehyde; and a mixture thereof.<br>
Acetaldol or paraldol employed may be obtained<br>
directly through aldol condensation of acetaldehyde in<br>
the presence of a basic catalyst. There can be employed<br>
a mixture of paraldol and aldoxane which is obtained by<br>
thermally decomposing at least a portion of aldoxane<br>
into paraldol and acetaldehyde. During thermal<br>
decomposition, a small amount of crotonaldehyde may be<br>
by-produced.<br>
Acetaldol, paraldol, aldoxane, or a mixture thereof<br>
may be used as a raw material for hydrogenation<br>
(hydrogenation reaction). A mixture (the mixture may be<br>
referred to as "crude reaction mixture") produced<br>
through condensation of acetaldehyde is usually<br>
neutralized with an acid in a neutralization step, and<br>
the mixture is used as a raw material for hydrogenation.<br>
Characteristic features of the first invention<br>
group will next be described.<br>
At least a portion of unreacted acetaldehyde is<br>
removed from a raw material for hydrogenation<br>
(hydrogenation reaction), since the unreacted<br>
acetaldehyde is usually recycled in a condensation step.<br>
However, the raw material for hydrogenation contains<br>
residual acetaldehyde, crotonaldehyde, small amounts of<br><br>
other aldehyde components, low-boiling-point substances,<br>
high-boiling-point substances such as aldehyde dimers<br>
and aldehyde trimers, and water. A raw material for<br>
hydrogenation containing water in an amount of 10-20 %<br>
by weight can be used. A hydrogenation raw material<br>
having a purity of 95-98 % by weight based on acetaldol<br>
components, exclusive of water, is preferably used.<br>
Step preceding hydrogenation<br>
Before hydrogenation, a raw material for<br>
hydrogenation may be optionally subjected to a<br>
preliminary treatment such as distillation for removing<br>
alcohols, dehydration distillation, removal of salts, or<br>
removal of impurities, and the thus-treated raw material<br>
from which unreacted acetaldehyde and by-products such<br>
as crotonaldehyde have been removed may be used.<br>
Examples of the preliminary treatment include<br>
distillation, adsorption, ion exchange, heating for<br>
forming high-boiling-point substances, and decomposition<br>
Examples of the distillation method employed include<br>
reduced-pressure distillation, ambient-pressure<br>
distillation, compressed distillation, azeotropic<br>
distillation, extracting distillation, and reactive<br>
distillation.<br>
Hydrogen<br>
The hydrogen to be employed for the hydrogenation<br><br>
is not particularly limited, and may be hydrogen which<br>
is usually used for hydrogenation in chemical synthesis.<br>
For example, the hydrogen has a purity of 99 % by weight<br>
or more, preferably 99.5 % by weight or more.<br>
Catalyst<br>
The catalyst to be used for the hydrogenation (the<br>
catalyst may be referred to as "hydrogenation catalyst")<br>
is not particularly limited, and, for example, a Raney<br>
nickel can be used.<br>
Hydrogenation step<br>
The hydrogenation can be carried out through any of<br>
a batch-type process, a semi-batch-type process, and a<br>
continuous process.<br>
The catalyst may be suspended in a raw material for<br>
hydrogenation or packed in a tower. Preferably, a<br>
catalyst is suspended in the raw material.<br>
For example, a catalyst (2-20 parts by weight,<br>
preferably 5-10 parts by weight) is added to a raw<br>
material for hydrogenation (100 parts by weight), and<br>
the catalyst is suspended in the material with mixing or<br>
stirring under a hydrogen pressure of 80-200 kg/cm2,<br>
preferably 120-150 kg/cm2, at a temperature of 110-140°C,<br>
preferably 120-135°C, for 40-100 minutes, preferably 70-<br>
90 minutes, to thereby allow reaction to proceed.<br>
However, 1,3-butylene glycol produced through<br><br>
hydrogenation of acetaldols is prone to contain minor<br>
amounts of low-boiling-point compounds having an<br>
unsaturated bond, such as acetaldehyde, butyraldehyde,<br>
crotonaldehyde, acetone, or methyl vinyl ketone, all of<br>
which are considered to be substances causing odor.<br>
Conventionally, it has been difficult to completely<br>
remove such the low-boiling-point compounds from 1,3-<br>
butylene glycol through distillation by use of a final<br>
product distillation tower. The term "the substance<br>
causing odor" refers to a substance which itself is a<br>
source of odor or a substance which with passage of time<br>
becomes an odoriferous substance.<br>
Conventional 1,3-butylene glycol produced through<br>
hydrogenation of acetaldols, distillation, and<br>
purification does not exhibit sufficiently long<br>
potassium permanganate color-fading time as measured<br>
according to JIS K1351 3.10 immediately after production<br>
Particularly, the color-fading time of conventional 1,3-<br>
butylene glycol after three months of storage is short,<br>
for example, 3 minutes or less, and thus, the glycol is<br>
considered to contain a substance which issues no odor<br>
immediately after production but which with passage of<br>
time undergoes change into an odoriferous substance.<br>
A conventional purification process for 1,3-<br>
butylene glycol produced through hydrogenation of<br>
acetaldols is described below. After alcohols, water,<br>
salts, a catalyst, and high-boiling-point substances<br><br>
have been removed from a hydrogenation crude mixture<br>
containing 1,3-butylene glycol produced through<br>
catalytic reduction of acetaldols, the 1,3-butylene<br>
glycol was obtained, as a bottom product, from the<br>
bottom portion of a distillation tower (a final product<br>
distillation tower) for removing low-boiling-point<br>
substances.<br>
An embodiment of production of 1,3-butylene glycol<br>
of high purity is the first invention group will next be<br>
described.<br>
When a specific alkali metal compound is added to a<br>
crude 1,3-butylene glycol or a bottom product which is<br>
produced through the aforementioned conventional process<br>
and is subjected to distillation (distillation for<br>
removal of high-boiling-point substances) for removing<br>
high-boiling-point substances, and the resultant 1,3-<br>
butylene glycol is subjected to heating treatment,<br>
substances causing odor can be effectively reduced, and<br>
1,3-butylene glycol which undergoes minimal change in<br>
quality with passage of time can be obtained.<br>
Since the crude 1,3-butylene glycol or 1,3-butylene<br>
glycol as a bottom product after distillation for<br>
removal of high-boiling-point substances contains small<br>
amounts of high-boiling-point substances, even when the<br>
1,3-butylene glycol is heated with an alkali, no amount<br>
or a very small amount of low-boiling-point substances<br>
is produced through decomposition of high-boiling-point<br><br>
substances. Briefly, the amount of low-boiling-point<br>
substances causing odor is effectively reduced through<br>
reaction with an alkali. As a result, the absolute<br>
amount of low-boiling-point substances can be reduced to<br>
about zero. Therefore, 1,3-butylene glycol of very high<br>
purity which issues no odor and undergoes a minimal<br>
change in quality with passage of time can be produced.<br>
The 1,3-butylene glycol of the present invention<br>
exhibits potassium permanganate color-fading time of at<br>
least 15 minutes, preferably at least 25 minutes, more<br>
preferably at least 35 minutes, as measured according to<br>
JIS K1351 3.10 immediately after production, and<br>
exhibits potassium permanganate color-fading time of at<br>
least 5 minutes, preferably at least 10 minutes, more<br>
preferably at least 20 minutes, as measured according to<br>
JIS K1351 3.10 at a period of three months after<br>
production. The 1,3-butylene glycol is characterized by<br>
issuing very reduced odor and producing minimal change<br>
in quality with passage of time. The color-fading time<br>
of the 1,3-butylene glycol after storage can be measured<br>
at any time, so long as at least three months have<br>
elapsed after production.<br>
Fig. 1 is a flowsheet showing an embodiment for<br>
producing a 1,3-butylene glycol of high purity of the<br>
first invention group. Reference numeral 1-1 represents<br>
a dehydration tower, 1-2 is a salt-removal tower (thin-<br>
film evaporator), 1-3 is a distillation tower for<br><br>
removal of high-boiling-point substances, 1-4 is an<br>
alkali reactor, 1-5 is an alkali-removal tower (thin-<br>
film evaporator), and 1-6 is a final product<br>
distillation tower.<br>
Crude 1,3-butylene glycol which has been subjected<br>
to distillation for removing high-boiling-point<br>
substances is fed into the alkali reactor (e.g., a flow-<br>
type tubular reactor) 1-4. Simultaneously, an alkali<br>
metal compound is added to the crude 1,3-butylene glycol<br>
in an amount of 0.05-10 % by weight, preferably 0.1-<br>
1.0 % by weight, on the basis of the entirety of the<br>
butylene glycol. When the amount of the alkali metal<br>
compound added to the crude butylene glycol is 10 % by<br>
weight or more, the alkali metal compound is<br>
precipitated in, for example, a distillation tower or a<br>
feed pipe, to thereby cause clogging, which is not<br>
preferable. In addition, when the amount of the alkali<br>
metal compound added is very large, decomposition of<br>
high-boiling-point substances proceeds, resulting in<br>
generation of substances causing odor. In contrast,<br>
when the amount of the alkali metal compound added is<br>
less than 0.05 % by weight, the effect of the compound<br>
on substances causing odor is lowered, which are not<br>
preferable. The 1,3-butylene glycol is fed into the<br>
alkali reactor 1-4.<br>
In the purification process for the 1,3-butylene<br>
glycol, the alkali metal compound to be added must be at<br><br>
least one compound of sodium hydroxide and potassium<br>
hydroxide. The alkali metal compound may be added in<br>
the form of a solid. However, from a viewpoint of<br>
operation and in order to facilitate bringing the alkali<br>
metal compound into contact with a target solution<br>
easily, the compound is preferably added in the form of<br>
an aqueous solution.<br>
In the alkali reactor 1-4, the reaction temperature<br>
is 90-140°C, preferably 110-130°C. This is because, when<br>
the reaction temperature is low, reaction residence time<br>
becomes long, requiring a reactor of large capacity,<br>
which is not economical, whereas when the reaction<br>
temperature is high, the odor of the 1,3-butylene glycol<br>
is impaired. The reaction residence time is 5-120<br>
minutes, preferably 10-30 minutes. When the residence<br>
time is short, the reaction proceeds insufficiently, and<br>
the quality of a final product is impaired, whereas when<br>
the residence time is long, a reactor of large capacity<br>
is required, resulting in high equipment cost, which is<br>
disadvantageous from the viewpoint of economics.<br>
It is to be noted that the crude 1,3-butylene<br>
glycol fed into the alkali reactor may be any type of a<br>
crude 1,3-butylene glycol, so long as the butylene<br>
glycol has been subjected to distillation for removing<br>
high-boiling-point substances. For example, the crude<br>
butylene glycol may be even a product 1,3-butylene<br>
glycol obtained from the bottom of the product<br><br>
distillation tower employed in the aforementioned<br>
conventional process.<br>
The resultant crude reaction mixture is discharged<br>
from the alkali reactor 1-4, and then fed into the<br>
alkali-removal tower (thin-film evaporator) 1-5. The<br>
alkali metal compound used for the reaction is removed<br>
from the bottom of the tower. The evaporator to be<br>
employed as the alkali-removal tower is appropriately a<br>
naturally falling-type thin film evaporator realizing<br>
short residence time or a forcibly stirring-type thin-<br>
film evaporator, in order to suppress thermal history of<br>
a process fluid.<br>
In the evaporator, evaporation is carried out under<br>
a reduced pressure of 100 torr or less, preferably 5-20<br>
torr, as measured at the top of the evaporator. In<br>
order to reduce the odor of 1,3-butylene glycol, the<br>
distillation (evaporation) temperature is preferably<br>
lower, and the pressure is preferably lower. When<br>
distillation is carried out under the aforementioned<br>
conditions, the temperature of the evaporator is<br>
maintained at 90-120°C. The added alkali metal compound<br>
is removed from the bottom of the evaporator together<br>
with high-boiling-point substances. 1,3-Butylene glycol<br>
containing low-temperature-point substances is obtained<br>
as a distillate from the top of the evaporator and then<br>
fed into the final product distillation tower.<br>
The final product distillation tower may be a<br><br>
perforated plate tower or a bubble-cap tower.<br>
Preferably, the final product distillation tower is a<br>
packed tower of low pressure loss which is packed with<br>
Sluzer Packing or Melapack (a trade name of Sumitomo<br>
Heavy Industries, Ltd.). Such a packed tower is used in<br>
order to reduce the distillation temperature to as low<br>
as possible, since 1,3-butylene glycol is thermally<br>
decomposed at 200°C or higher, and adverse effects in<br>
relation to odor are obtained (Japanese Patent<br>
Application Laid-Open (kokai) No. 63-156738). Similarly,<br>
when the thermal history (residence time) of 1,3-<br>
butylene glycol is long, adverse effects are obtained.<br>
Therefore, a reboiler to be employed is appropriately a<br>
thin-film evaporator realizing short residence time of a<br>
process fluid, such as a naturally falling-type thin<br>
film evaporator or a forcibly stirring-type thin-film<br>
evaporator.<br>
The theoretical plate number of the final product<br>
distillation tower varies with the concentration of low-<br>
boiling-point substances contained in the solution fed<br>
into the tower. When the concentration of low-boiling-<br>
point substances contained in the solution fed into the<br>
tower is 5% or less, the theoretical plate number of the<br>
tower is about 10-20. The solution is preferably fed to<br>
a position 20-70% of the height of the tower distant<br>
from the top of the tower. Distillation is carried out<br>
under a reduced pressure of 100 torr or less, preferably<br><br>
5-20 torr, as measured at the top of the tower. In<br>
order to reduce the order of the 1,3-butylene glycol,<br>
the distillation temperature is preferably lower, and<br>
the pressure is preferably lower. Distillation is<br>
preferably carried out at a reflux ratio of 0.5-2.0.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, the solution obtained by<br>
condensing the vapor from the alkali-removal tower in<br>
the condenser 1-5-2 is fed into the final product<br>
distillation tower. However, in order to reduce the<br>
amount of steam for heating the final product<br>
distillation tower, the vapor from the top of the<br>
alkali-removal tower may be fed directly into the<br>
product distillation tower. 1,3-Butylene glycol as a<br>
product is obtained from the bottom of the final product<br>
distillation tower. The thus-obtained 1,3-butylene<br>
glycol exhibits sufficiently long potassium permanganate<br>
color-fading time as measured according to JIS K1351<br>
3.10; i.e., the 1,3-butylene glycol of high purity<br>
contains very small amounts of reducing substances, etc.,<br>
issues no odor, and undergoes a minimal change in<br>
quality with passage of time.<br>
Characteristic features of the second invention<br>
group will next be described.<br>
In the second invention group, the hydrogen source<br>
material, the step preceding hydrogenation which is<br>
carried out according to needs, and the hydrogen which<br>
is employed are similar to those described in the first<br><br>
invention group.<br>
In the second invention group, a catalyst used for<br>
hydrogenation (the catalyst may be referred to as<br>
"hydrogenation catalyst") is a Raney nickel having a<br>
specific hydrogenation activity.<br>
The Raney nickel to be employed contains nickel in<br>
an amount of about 50 % by weight during alloying,<br>
contains aluminum in an amount of less than 10 % by<br>
weight after development, and exhibits the following<br>
acetone hydrogenation activity and/or phenol<br>
hydrogenation activity.<br>
(i) The acetone hydrogen activity is at least 2,000<br>
ml/g-Ni/hr, preferably at least 3,000 ml/g-Ni/hr, more<br>
preferably at least 4,000 ml/g-Ni/hr.<br>
When the acetone hydrogenation activity is less<br>
than 2,000 ml/g-Ni/hr, it is difficult to efficiently<br>
obtain 1,3-butylene glycol of reduced odor from a<br>
hydrogenation crude mixture through distillation.<br>
The term "acetone hydrogenation activity" refers to<br>
the hydrogen absorption rate by acetone as measured for<br>
a period of from five minutes to 30 minutes after<br>
initiation of hydrogenation of the acetone, which is<br>
carried out at 25°C and ambient pressure after wet a<br>
Raney nickel (0.3 g) is added to acetone (50 ml). The<br>
acetone hydrogenation activity is represented by<br>
hydrogen absorption amount (unit: ml/g-Ni/hr). The<br>
accurate amount of nickel contained in the wet Raney<br><br>
nickel is obtained through analysis after the<br>
hydrogenation.<br>
(ii) The phenol hydrogenation activity is at least<br>
500 ml/g-Ni/hr, preferably at least 800 ml/g-Ni/hr, more<br>
preferably at least 1,100 ml/g-Ni/hr.<br>
When the phenol hydrogenation activity is less than<br>
500 ml/g-Ni/hr, it is difficult to efficiently obtain<br>
1,3-butylene glycol of reduced odor from a hydrogenation<br>
crude mixture through distillation.<br>
The term "phenol hydrogenation activity" refers to<br>
the hydrogen absorption rate by phenol as measured for a<br>
period of from five minutes to 30 minutes after<br>
initiation of hydrogenation of the phenol, which is<br>
carried out at 50°C and ambient pressure after a wet<br>
Raney nickel (0.5 g) is added to a solution mixture of<br>
phenol and cyclohexanol (volume ratio 7:3) (60 ml). The<br>
phenol hydrogenation activity is represented by hydrogen<br>
absorption amount (unit: ml/g-Ni/hr). The accurate<br>
amount of nickel contained in the wet Raney nickel is<br>
obtained through analysis after the hydrogenation.<br>
Hydrogenation step<br>
Hydrogenation is carried out through the reaction<br>
process under the reaction conditions described in the<br>
first invention group. Hydrogenation is carried out<br>
such that the amount of the aldehyde groups remaining in<br>
a hydrogenation crude mixture becomes 200 ppm by weight<br><br>
or less, preferably 50 ppm by weight or less, more<br>
preferably 20 ppm by weight or less, much more<br>
preferably 10 ppm by weight or less.<br>
Purification step after hydrogenation<br>
A hydrogenation crude mixture is subjected to a<br>
treatment, such as distillation for removal of alcohols,<br>
dehydration distillation, evaporation, removal of<br>
impurities, chemical treatment of a remaining double<br>
bond, or a combination thereof.<br>
The distillation for removal of alcohols is carried<br>
out for removing generated alcohols such as ethanol,<br>
isopropanol, and butanol.<br>
The dehydration distillation is carried out for<br>
removing generated water and for subjecting impurities<br>
to azeotropic distillation with water.<br>
The evaporation is carried out for removing<br>
neutralized products of the hydrogenation catalyst or a<br>
base, which are generated, for example, in the<br>
condensation step, and thermally-decomposable high-<br>
boiling-point substances. Evaporation is carried out by<br>
means of an evaporation operation of short heating<br>
residence time, such as single distillation or flash<br>
distillation.<br>
The chemical treatment of a remaining double bond<br>
is carried out by adding, for example, a hydroxide<br>
alkali or ozone to a double bond, particularly a double<br><br>
bond which reacts in the chameleon test (potassium<br>
permanganate solution color-fading time as measured<br>
according to JIS K1351 3.10), by cleaving the double<br>
bond, or by reducing the double bond with, for example,<br>
sodium borohydride.<br>
The removal of impurities is carried out for<br>
removing other low-boiling-point substances such as<br>
butanone and high-boiling-point substances, and is<br>
carried out by means of, for example, distillation,<br>
adsorption, or ion exchange.<br>
The distillation method is not particularly limited,<br>
so long as low-boiling-point substances and high-<br>
boiling-point substances can be separated from 1,3-<br>
butylene glycol by utilizing the difference in boiling<br>
point between the 1,3-butylene glycol and the substances<br>
Examples of the distillation method to be employed<br>
include reduced-pressure distillation, ambient-pressure<br>
distillation, compressed distillation, azeotropic<br>
distillation, extracting distillation, and reactive<br>
distillation.<br>
No particular limitation is imposed on the types of<br>
the purification processes after hydrogenation and the<br>
order of the processes. For example, removal of<br>
alcohols, azeotropic dehydration for removal of low-<br>
boiling-point substances, evaporation, removal of high-<br>
boiling-point substances through distillation of 1,3-<br>
butylene glycol, and removal of low-boiling-point<br><br>
substances through distillation are carried out<br>
successively, to thereby produce a purified 1,3-butylene<br>
glycol.<br>
A characteristic feature of the second invention<br>
group resides in that acetaldols are hydrogenated by use<br>
of a Raney nickel catalyst having a specific<br>
hydrogenation activity, the resultant hydrogenation<br>
crude mixture is subjected to distillation to thereby<br>
separate low-boiling-point components (L), and then the<br>
resultant mixture is further subjected to distillation,<br>
to thereby yield 1,3-butylene glycol as a distillate.<br>
Examples of the low-boiling-point components (L)<br>
include alcohols such as the aforementioned ethanol,<br>
isopropanol, and butanol; water; impurities which are<br>
azeotropically distilled with moisture and water; and<br>
other low-boiling-point substances.<br>
Therefore, in order to separate the low-boiling-<br>
point components (L), distillation for removal of<br>
alcohols, dehydration distillation, and distillation for<br>
removal of other low-boiling-point substances may be<br>
carried out separately, or a single distillation<br>
operation may be carried out. Usually, when a valuable<br>
product such as ethanol or butanol is recovered,<br>
distillation for removal of ethanol and distillation for<br>
removal of butanol may be carried out separately. In<br>
order to further reduce odor, dehydration distillation<br>
may be carried out after distillation for removal of<br><br>
alcohols.<br>
When the hydrogenation crude mixture is subjected<br>
to distillation to thereby yield 1,3-butylene glycol as<br>
a distillate, the catalyst, neutralized salts, and high-<br>
boiling-point substances, including thermally<br>
decomposable high-boiling-point substances, which are<br>
contained in the crude mixture, are impaired, and a<br>
component which is distilled together with the 1,3-<br>
butylene glycol is produced, the component causing<br>
lowering of purity, odor, coloring of the butylene<br>
glycol, etc. Therefore, in order to separate the<br>
catalyst, the neutralized salts, and the high-boiling-<br>
point substances including thermally decomposable high-<br>
boiling-point substances, the aforementioned evaporation<br>
treatment can be carried out after separation of the<br>
low-boiling-point components (L).<br>
After the evaporation treatment, the resultant<br>
hydrogenation crude mixture can be subjected to<br>
distillation, to thereby obtain a purified 1,3-butylene<br>
glycol as a distillate.<br>
In order to further reduce odor, the 1,3-butylene<br>
glycol distillate may further be subjected to<br>
distillation, to thereby separate low-boiling-point<br>
components (1).<br>
The term low-boiling-point components (1) refers to<br>
an impurity contained in the 1,3-butylene glycol<br>
distillate. Examples of the low-boiling-point<br><br>
components (1) include a minor amount of alcohols, such<br>
as ethanol, isopropanol, and butanol; water; and other<br>
low-boiling-point substances.<br>
After the evaporation treatment, the hydrogenation<br>
crude mixture may be subjected to distillation, to<br>
thereby separate the low-boiling-point components (1).<br>
Preferably, after the evaporation treatment, 1,3-<br>
butylene glycol is obtained as a distillate, and the<br>
1,3-butylene glycol distillate is subjected to<br>
distillation, to thereby separate the low-boiling-point<br>
components (1).<br>
Thus, the purified 1,3-butylene glycol of reduced<br>
odor can be produced reliably and efficiently.<br>
Quantification of remaining aldehyde group<br>
In the present invention, the amount of aldehyde<br>
groups remaining in the hydrogenation crude mixture, the<br>
aldehyde groups being considered to be a substance<br>
causing odor, is quantified, and the hydrogenation<br>
process can be controlled.<br>
Examples of the method for quantifying the content<br>
of aldehyde groups include a hydroxylamine hydrochloride<br>
method in which hydroxylamine hydrochloride is added to<br>
the hydrogenation crude mixture and a liberated hydrogen<br>
chloride component is quantified.<br>
Examples of the method for quantifying the hydrogen<br>
chloride component include a method in which an<br><br>
indicator, such as, Bromophenol Blue (BPB), is added and<br>
discoloration time is measured.<br>
Hereinafter, a method in which the BPB is added to<br>
a hydrogen chloride component which is liberated by<br>
adding hydroxylamine hydrochloride (HA HCl) to the<br>
hydrogenation crude mixture and discoloration time is<br>
measured will be abbreviated as "HA-HC1-BPB method."<br>
Hydroxylamine hydrochloride-Bromophenol Blue (HA?HC1-<br>
BPB) method<br>
Usually, hydroxylamine hydrochloride (HA?HCl)<br>
reacts with carbonyl compounds such as aldehyde and<br>
ketone as follows, to thereby liberate hydrochloric acid<br>
RCH = O + NH2OH-HC1 ? RCH = NOH + H2O + HCl<br>
The indicator BPB discolors by the liberated<br>
hydrochloric acid. The discoloration is quantified by<br>
means of colorimetry by visual observation or by use of<br>
a colorimeter. In the present invention, the<br>
hydrogenation process and distillation conditions can be<br>
monitored by means of colorimetry by visual observation,<br>
instead of through direct measurement of the content of<br>
aldehyde groups. Therefore, such colorimetry falls<br>
within the meaning of the method for quantifying the<br>
content of remaining aldehyde groups.<br>
HA?HC1-BPB method<br>
The method for quantifying the content of aldehyde<br><br>
groups remaining in the hydrogenation crude mixture<br>
relating to the present invention is carried out as<br>
follows.<br>
Preparation of <br>
BPB (0.1 g) and ethanol (20 ml) are added to a 100-<br>
ml messflask and dissolved, and distilled water is added<br>
to the messflask until the level of the water reaches an<br>
indicator of the messflask.<br>
Preparation of <bpb-added hydroxylamine hydrochloride></bpb-added>
solution&gt;<br>
(1) Hydroxylamine hydrochloride (69.5 g) is added<br>
to a 1-liter messflask, the 0.1% BPB solution (25 ml) is<br>
added to the messflask, and pure water is added to the<br>
messflask until the level of the water reaches the<br>
indicator of the messflask.<br>
(2) A l/10N-NaOH aqueous solution is added to the<br>
solution prepared in (1), to thereby adjust the pH of<br>
the solution to 3.5.<br>
(Analysis operation)<br>
(1) The hydrogenation crude mixture (5 ml) after<br>
filtration of the catalyst is sampled in a test tube.<br>
(2) The above-prepared BPB-added hydroxylamine<br>
hydrochloride solution (5 ml) is added to the sampled<br>
solution, and mixed therewith, to thereby prepare a test<br>
solution.<br>
(3) The time required for changing the color of the<br>
test solution from blue or yellow-green into yellow is<br><br>
measured as discoloration time.<br>
When acetaldol was used as a sample, and<br>
discoloration time was measured. The correlation<br>
between the content of aldehyde groups and discoloration<br>
time is described below. The content of aldehyde groups<br>
is obtained by the following formula: the content of<br>
aldehyde groups = the content of acetaldol x 29.1/88.1.<br><br>
The quality of the hydrogenation crude mixture<br>
correlates to the content of aldehyde groups remaining<br>
in the mixture. As described below, the quality of the<br>
hydrogenation crude mixture can be determined by the<br>
length of discoloration time when the BPB-added<br>
hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution is added to the<br>
mixture.<br>
(1) In the case of good quality: blue ? yellow-<br>
green ? yellow (time required for changing the color of<br>
the mixture from blue to yellow-green is long.)<br>
(2) In the case of poor quality: blue ? yellow-<br>
green ? yellow (time required for changing the color of<br>
the mixture from blue to yellow-green is short.)<br>
(3) In the case of very poor quality: the color of<br>
the mixture becomes yellow immediately after addition of<br>
the BPB-added hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution.<br>
The correlation between the aforementioned<br>
discoloration time and the distillation process for<br>
obtaining a purified 1,3-butylene glycol which issues no<br>
odor or considerably reduced odor is summarized below on<br>
the basis of the results of actual operations.<br>
in the aforementioned correlation is the cut percentage<br>
of low-boiling-point-substances and/or high-boiling-<br>
point substances. The cut percentage correlates to the<br>
separation plate number of the distillation tower and<br>
the reflux ratio. When the separation plate number and<br>
the reflux ratio are increased, the cut percentage can<br>
be reduced, but facility costs or costs for utilities<br>
such as steam are increased.<br>
The discoloration time is at least one hour,<br>
preferably at least four hours, more preferably at least<br>
eight hours, much more preferably at least 16 hours.<br>
When the discoloration time is less than one hour, the<br>
cut percentage is drastically increased in order to<br>
obtain a purified 1,3-butylene glycol which issues a<br>
considerably reduced odor, and thus productivity is<br>
lowered considerably.<br>
The purified 1,3-butylene glycol produced through<br>
the process of the second invention group is used as an<br>
intermediate material for producing a solvent for paints<br>
and various compounds. Also, the 1,3-butylene glycol<br>
can be used as a raw material for cosmetics such as a<br>
humectant and as an additive for animal feeds, since the<br>
1,3-butylene glycol has high purity and does not issue<br>
any problematic odor or exhibit any disagreeable taste.<br>
According to the second invention group, control of<br>
the process is rationalized, the yield of the purified<br>
1,3-butylene glycol which issues no odor or a<br><br>
considerably reduced odor is enhanced, costs for<br>
utilities are reduced, and 1,3-butylene glycol of<br>
reduced odor can be produced efficiently and reliably.<br>
Characteristic features of the third invention<br>
group will next be described.<br>
Aldols obtained through condensation of<br>
acetaldehyde in the presence of a basic catalyst have<br>
been defined in connection with the first invention<br>
group.<br>
In the third invention group, an acid is added to a<br>
mixture produced in an aldehyde condensation step (the<br>
mixture may be referred to as "crude reaction mixture")<br>
so as to acidify the mixture, and the resultant mixture<br>
is used as a raw material for hydrogenation. As<br>
described in connection with the first invention group,<br>
at least a portion of unreacted acetaldehyde is removed<br>
from the hydrogenation raw material, since the unreacted<br>
acetaldehyde is usually recycled in the condensation<br>
step. However, the raw material for hydrogenation may<br>
contain residual acetaldehyde, crotonaldehyde, small<br>
amounts of aldehyde components, low-boiling-point<br>
substances, high-boiling-point substances such as<br>
aldehyde dimers and aldehyde trimers, and water. A raw<br>
material for hydrogenation containing water in an amount<br>
of 10-20 % by weight can be used. A raw material for<br>
hydrogenation having a purity of 95-98 % by weight based<br><br>
on acetaldol components, exclusive of water, is<br>
preferably used.<br>
Acidification of the produced mixture may be<br>
carried out after neutralization following condensation<br>
of acetaldehyde, or may be carried out after thermal<br>
decomposition of aldoxane. Preferably, after thermal<br>
decomposition of aldoxane is carried out in a neutral<br>
atmosphere, the produced mixture is acidified<br>
immediately before hydrogenation so as to attain a<br>
predetermined acidity. Thus, by-production of<br>
crotonaldehyde-which is by-produced through<br>
dehydration in an acidic state during thermal<br>
decomposition of aldoxane—can be reduced.<br>
Examples of the aforementioned acid include organic<br>
acids and inorganic acids. Examples of the inorganic<br>
acids include phosphoric acid and monoalkyl or dialkyl<br>
esters of phosphoric acid. Organic acids are preferred.<br>
Examples of the organic acids include monocarboxylic<br>
acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, and propionic<br>
acid; and dicarboxylic acids such as oxalic acid,<br>
malonic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, and tartaric<br>
acid. Monocarboxylic acids are more preferred, with<br>
acetic acid being particularly preferred.<br>
100% Acetic acid may be used, but, in order to<br>
facilitate neutralization and acidification operations,<br>
for example, a 5-20 % by volume acetic acid aqueous<br>
solution is used.<br><br>
The acidity of the raw material for hydrogenation<br>
is 1-30, preferably 2-10. Herein, the acidity refers to<br>
an amount (ml) of a 1/10 N sodium hydroxide aqueous<br>
solution to be required for neutralizing 100 ml of a<br>
sample (indicator: phenolphthalein).<br>
In the third invention group, since the acidity of<br>
the mixture subjected to hydrogenation falls within the<br>
above range, impairment of a catalyst during the<br>
hydrogenation step—which is attributed to, for example,<br>
generation of polymers—can be prevented. When the<br>
acidity is below the above range, prevention of catalyst<br>
impairment is unsatisfactory, whereas when the acidity<br>
exceeds the above range, the by-production percentage of<br>
butanol is increased, which is attributed to by-<br>
production of crotonaldehyde, or corrosion of an<br>
apparatus employed in the hydrogenation step proceeds.<br>
Step preceding hydrogenation<br>
The raw material for hydrogenation and the<br>
treatment method thereof are similar to those described<br>
in connection with the first invention group, except<br>
that, in the third invention group, there is employed a<br>
crude reaction mixture which has been adjusted to have<br>
an acidity of a predetermined range.<br>
The hydrogen and the catalyst used for<br>
hydrogenation are similar to those described in<br>
connection with the first invention group.<br><br>
Hydrogenation step<br>
As described in connection with the first invention<br>
group, hydrogenation is carried out such that the<br>
content of the aldehyde groups remaining in a<br>
hydrogenation crude mixture becomes 200 ppm by weight or<br>
less, preferably 50 ppm by weight or less, more<br>
preferably 20 ppm by weight or less, much more<br>
preferably 10 ppm by weight or less. In the third<br>
invention group, the acidity of the mixture is<br>
maintained so as to fall within the aforementioned range<br>
during hydrogenation.<br>
Production step after hydrogenation reaction<br>
As described in connection with the purification<br>
step after hydrogenation reaction of the second<br>
invention group, a hydrogenation crude mixture is<br>
subjected to a treatment, such as distillation for<br>
removal of alcohols, dehydration distillation,<br>
evaporation, removal of impurities, chemical treatment<br>
of remaining double bonds, or a combination thereof.<br>
The subsidiary description of these treatments has been<br>
provided in connection with the purification step after<br>
hydrogenation of the second invention group.<br>
1,3-Butylene glycol produced through the process of<br>
the third invention group is used as an intermediate<br>
material for producing a solvent for paints and various<br><br>
compounds. Also, the 1,3-butylene glycol can be used as<br>
a raw material for cosmetics such as a humectant, and as<br>
an additive for animal feed, since the 1,3-butylene<br>
glycol has high purity and does not issue any<br>
problematic odor or exhibit any disagreeable taste.<br>
Characteristic features of the fourth invention<br>
group will next be described.<br>
Aldols produced through condensation of<br>
acetaldehyde have been described in connection with the<br>
first invention group. A mixture produced in an<br>
acetaldehyde condensation step is usually neutralized<br>
with an acid in the subsequent neutralization step, and<br>
the resultant mixture is used as a raw material for<br>
hydrogenation. The crude reaction mixture used in the<br>
hydrogenation step may be even neutral. However, when<br>
the mixture is acidified with acetic acid so as to<br>
attain an acidity of 1-30, preferably 2-10, there can be<br>
prevented impairment of a catalyst which is attributed<br>
to generation of polymers in the hydrogenation step<br>
(hydrogenation reaction), or there can be prevented by-<br>
production of butanol, etc. which is attributed to by-<br>
production of crotonaldehyde, etc. The aforementioned<br>
raw material for hydrogenation has been defined in<br>
connection with the first invention group.<br>
Acidification of the crude reaction mixture by use of an<br>
organic acid or inorganic acid in the hydrogenation step<br><br>
and the acidity of the mixture have been described in<br>
connection with the third invention group.<br>
Step preceding hydrogenation<br>
The raw material for hydrogenation and the<br>
treatment method thereof are similar to those described<br>
in connection with the first invention group, except<br>
that, in the fourth invention group, there is employed a<br>
crude reaction mixture of aldehyde condensation reaction<br>
which has been adjusted to have an acidity of a<br>
predetermined range. Further, hydrogen and catalysts to<br>
be employed for hydrogenation are also described in the<br>
first invention group.<br>
Hydrogenation step<br>
As described in connection with the first invention<br>
group, hydrogenation is carried out such that the<br>
content of the aldehyde groups remaining in a<br>
hydrogenation crude mixture becomes 200 ppm by weight or<br>
less, preferably 50 ppm by weight or less, more<br>
preferably 20 ppm by weight or less, much more<br>
preferably 10 ppm by weight or less. In the present<br>
invention (the fourth invention group), the acidity of<br>
the mixture is maintained so as to fall within the<br>
aforementioned range during hydrogenation.<br>
Production step after hydrogenation reaction<br><br>
As described in connection with the purification<br>
step after hydrogenation of the second invention group,<br>
a hydrogenation crude mixture is subjected to a<br>
treatment, such as distillation for removal of alcohols,<br>
dehydration distillation, evaporation, removal of<br>
impurities, chemical treatment of remaining double bond,<br>
or a combination thereof. The subsidiary description of<br>
these treatments has been provided in connection with<br>
the purification step after hydrogenation of the second<br>
invention group.<br>
In the fourth invention group, after low-boiling-<br>
point substances such as alcohols are removed from the<br>
hydrogenation crude mixture, the resultant mixture is<br>
optionally subjected to dehydration distillation and<br>
evaporation, to thereby remove from the mixture<br>
neutralized salts, the catalyst, and thermally<br>
decomposable high-boiling-point substances, and the<br>
resultant mixture is subjected to distillation, to<br>
thereby yield 1,3-butylene glycol as a distillate.<br>
However, when alcohols, etc. are distilled off from<br>
the acidic hydrogenation crude mixture, ethers are<br>
generated from alcohols or 1,3-butylene glycol through<br>
heating, and thus the yield of 1,3-butylene glycol is<br>
reduced, and the quality of the purified 1,3-butylene<br>
glycol is lowered, which is attributed to contamination<br>
of ethers.<br><br>
Therefore, in the present invention (the fourth<br>
invention group), the hydrogenation crude mixture is<br>
basified, and then removal of alcohols through<br>
distillation, or evaporation is carried out. The<br>
hydrogenation crude mixture may be basified immediately<br>
after hydrogenation, after removal of ethanol, after<br>
removal of butanol, or after dehydration distillation.<br>
Preferably, the hydrogenation crude mixture is basified<br>
immediately after hydrogenation.<br>
The basified hydrogenation crude mixture has a pH<br>
of 9-12, preferably 10 or more, more preferably 11.0-<br>
11.5. When the hydrogenation crude mixture is acidic,<br>
ethers are generated. When the hydrogenation crude<br>
mixture is neutral or has a pH of less than 9, the yield<br>
or odor of 1,3-butylene glycol is not satisfactorily<br>
improved. On the other hand, when the hydrogenation<br>
crude mixture has a pH of more than 12, thermally<br>
decomposable high-boiling-point substances are<br>
decomposed to generate components causing odor or<br>
coloring, and thus the quality of purified 1,3-butylene<br>
glycol is lowered.<br>
The hydrogenation crude mixture is basified through<br>
use of, for example, lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide,<br>
potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, magnesium<br>
hydroxide, or amines. Preferably, sodium hydroxide or<br>
potassium hydroxide is used for basification. More<br>
preferably, sodium hydroxide is used.<br><br>
In order to facilitate addition of sodium hydroxide<br>
to the hydrogenation crude mixture, sodium hydroxide is<br>
used in the form of an aqueous solution. A 5-50 % by<br>
weight sodium hydroxide aqueous solution is used.<br>
A 1,3-butylene glycol distillate obtained through<br>
distillation can be used as a final product. In<br>
accordance with use, distillation of the distillate is<br>
further carried out, to thereby separate remaining low-<br>
boiling-point components.<br>
1,3-Butylene glycol produced through the process of<br>
the fourth invention group is used as an intermediate<br>
material for producing a solvent for paints and various<br>
compounds. Also, the 1,3-butylene glycol can be used as<br>
a raw material for cosmetics such as a humectant, and as<br>
an additive for animal feeds, since the 1,3-butylene<br>
glycol has high purity and does not issue any<br>
problematic odor or exhibit any disagreeable taste.<br>
Characteristic features of the fifth invention<br>
group will next be described.<br>
Aldols produced through condensation of<br>
acetaldehyde have been described in connection with the<br>
first invention group. A mixture produced in an<br>
acetaldehyde condensation step is usually neutralized<br>
with an acid in the subsequent neutralization step, and<br>
the resultant mixture is used as a raw material for<br>
hydrogenation. The crude reaction mixture used in the<br><br>
hydrogenation step may be even neutral. However, when<br>
the mixture is acidified with acetic acid so as to<br>
attain an acidity of 1-30, preferably 2-10, there can be<br>
prevented impairment of a catalyst which is attributed<br>
to generation of polymers in the hydrogenation step<br>
(hydrogenation reaction), or there can be prevented by-<br>
production of butanol, etc. which is attributed to by-<br>
production of crotonaldehyde, etc. The aforementioned<br>
raw material for hydrogenation has been defined in<br>
connection with the first invention group.<br>
Acidification of the crude reaction mixture by use of an<br>
organic acid or inorganic acid in the hydrogenation step<br>
and the acidity of the mixture have been described in<br>
connection with the third invention group.<br>
Step preceding hydrogenation<br>
The raw material for hydrogenation and the<br>
treatment method thereof are similar to those described<br>
in connection with the first invention group, except<br>
that, in the fifth invention group, there is employed a<br>
crude reaction mixture which has been adjusted to have<br>
an acidity of a predetermined range.<br>
Further, the hydrogen and the catalyst used for<br>
hydrogenation are similar to those described in<br>
connection with the first invention group.<br>
Hydrogenation step<br><br>
As described in connection with the first invention<br>
group, hydrogenation is carried out such that the<br>
content of the aldehyde groups remaining in a<br>
hydrogenation crude mixture becomes 200 ppm by weight or<br>
less, preferably 50 ppm by weight or less, more<br>
preferably 20 ppm by weight or less, much more<br>
preferably 10 wt. ppm or less. In the fifth invention<br>
group, the acidity of the mixture is maintained so as to<br>
fall within the aforementioned range during<br>
hydrogenation.<br>
Production step after hydrogenation<br>
As described in connection with the purification<br>
step after hydrogenation of the second invention group,<br>
a hydrogenation crude mixture is subjected to a<br>
treatment, such as distillation for removal of alcohols,<br>
dehydration distillation, evaporation, removal of<br>
impurities, chemical treatment of remaining double bond,<br>
or a combination thereof. The subsidiary description of<br>
these treatments has been provided in connection with<br>
the purification step after hydrogenation of the second<br>
invention group.<br>
A characteristic feature of the fifth invention<br>
group resides in that, after distillation of the<br>
hydrogenation crude mixture is carried out to thereby<br>
separate low-boiling-point components (L), the resultant<br><br>
mixture is subjected to distillation to thereby yield<br>
1,3-butylene glycol as a distillate, and the distilled<br>
1,3-butyelen glycol (D) is treated with ozone.<br>
Examples of the low-boiling-point components (L)<br>
include aldohols such as the aforementioned ethanol,<br>
isopropanol, and butanol; water; impurities which are<br>
azeotropically distilled together with moisture and<br>
water; and other low-boiling-point substances.<br>
Therefore, in order to separate the low-boiling-<br>
point components (L), distillation for removal of<br>
alcohols, dehydration distillation, and distillation for<br>
removal of other low-boiling-point substances may be<br>
even carried out separately, or a single distillation<br>
operation may be even carried out. Usually, when an<br>
organic product such as ethanol or butanol is recovered,<br>
distillation for removal of ethanol and distillation for<br>
removal of butanol may be carried out separately.<br>
Further, in order to further reduce odor, dehydration<br>
distillation may be carried out after distillation for<br>
removal of alcohols.<br>
When distillation of the hydrogenation crude<br>
mixture is carried out to thereby yield 1,3-butylene<br>
glycol as a distillate, thermally decomposable high-<br>
boiling-point substances contained in the crude mixture<br>
are impaired, and a component which is distilled<br>
together with the 1,3-butylene glycol is produced, the<br>
component causing lowering of purity, generation of odor,<br><br>
and coloring of the butylene glycol. Therefore, in<br>
order to separate salts, the catalyst, and high-boiling-<br>
point substances including the thermally decomposable<br>
high-boiling-point substances, the aforementioned<br>
evaporation treatment can be carried out after<br>
separation of the low-boiling-point components (L).<br>
After the evaporation treatment, the resultant<br>
hydrogenation crude mixture is subjected to distillation,<br>
to thereby obtain 1,3-butylene glycol as a distillate<br>
(D) .<br>
Ozone treatment<br>
During ozone treatment, impurities such as<br>
substances causing odor undergo chemical change,<br>
including decomposition and deodorization.<br>
Ozone (1 mg-1 g, preferably 10 mg-0.5 g) is added<br>
to 1 kg of the 1,3-butyele glycol distillate (D), and is<br>
brought into contact with the distillate at a<br>
temperature equal to or lower than the oxidation limit<br>
temperature of 1,3-butylene glycol, preferably at a<br>
temperature between ambient temperature and 60 C, for<br>
0.1-6 hours, preferably 0.5-2 hours, to thereby carry<br>
out ozone treatment.<br>
When the amount of added ozone is below the above<br>
range, the treatment proceeds insufficiently, and thus<br>
reduction of substances causing odor, etc. is difficult,<br>
whereas when the amount of added ozone exceeds the above<br><br>
range, costs required for the treatment increase, or<br>
side reaction is caused.<br>
In order to bring ozone into contact with the 1,3-<br>
butylene glycol distillate (D) , an ozone-containing gas<br>
is blown into the distillate, or the ozone-containing<br>
gas is involved in the distillate with stirring. When<br>
convenience is an important consideration, the ozone-<br>
containing gas is blown into the distillate.<br>
For example, while the 1,3-butylene glycol<br>
distillate (D) is continuously fed into a reactor, the<br>
ozone - containing gas is continuously fed through the<br>
bottom of the reactor, and an ozone-treated 1,3-butylene<br>
glycol is discharged from the top of the reactor.<br>
The reactor is not particularly limited, and a<br>
conventional gas-liquid contact-type reactor may be used.<br>
Gas-liquid contact process may employ a method in which<br>
a liquid is fed through the bottom of the reactor and<br>
the ozone-containing gas is fed through the bottom<br>
thereof, or a method in which a liquid is fed through<br>
the top of the reactor and ozone-containing gas is fed<br>
through the bottom thereof. The resultant reaction<br>
mixture may be also circulated.<br>
Ozone is generated through silent discharge by use<br>
of an ozone generator to which air or oxygen is supplied,<br>
or through electrolysis of a sulfuric acid aqueous<br>
solution.<br>
In the case of silent discharge of air, 0.1-10 % by<br><br>
weight of ozone can be generated. 10-30 % by weight of<br>
ozone can be generated by carrying out electrical<br>
discharge while the ozone generator is cooled with<br>
liquid air.<br>
When a sulfuric acid aqueous solution having a<br>
specific gravity of 1.1-1.4 is used, about 20 % by<br>
weight of ozone can be generated through electrolysis.<br>
If necessary, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, or air may<br>
be blown into the ozone-treated 1,3-butylene glycol to<br>
thereby purge remaining ozone, and the resultant 1,3-<br>
butylene glycol may be stored.<br>
Separation of low-boiling-point components (1)<br>
In order to obtain 1,3-butylene glycol of further<br>
high purity, low-boiling-point components (1) are<br>
separated from the ozone-treated 1,3-butylene glycol.<br>
The term low-boiling-point components (1) refers to low-<br>
boiling-point components contained in the ozone-treated<br>
1,3-butylene glycol. Specific examples of the low-<br>
boiling-point components (1) include low-boiling-point<br>
substances which exist in 1,3-butylene glycol after<br>
hydrogenation, such as small amounts of the low-boiling<br>
point components (L) remaining in the 1,3-butylene<br>
glycol; and low-boiling-point substances generated<br>
through the ozone treatment.<br>
Examples of the method for separating the low-<br>
boiling-point components (1) include a method in which<br><br>
the ozone-treated 1,3-butylene glycol is fed into a<br>
distillation tower, and the low-boiling-point components<br>
(1) are distilled from the tower through distillation; a<br>
method in which the ozone-treated 1,3-butylene glycol is<br>
subjected to topping by means of heating; a method in<br>
which the ozone-treated 1,3-butylene glycol is subjected<br>
to bubbling by blowing nitrogen, carbon dioxide, air,<br>
etc. through the bottom of a distillation tower; a<br>
method in which heated steam is blown into a<br>
distillation tower and the low-boiling-point components<br>
(1) are discharged together with the steam; a method in<br>
which heated 1,3-butylene glycol is fed into a reduced-<br>
pressure chamber and the low-boiling-point components<br>
(1) are subjected to flash distillation; a method<br>
employing membrane separation; a method employing<br>
adsorption; and a combination of these methods. These<br>
methods may be carried out at ambient pressure or under<br>
reduced pressure.<br>
Purified 1,3-butylene glycol produced through the<br>
process of the fifth invention group is used as an<br>
intermediate material for producing a solvent for paints<br>
and various compounds. Also, the 1,3-butylene glycol<br>
can be used as a raw material for cosmetics such as a<br>
humectant, and as an additive for animal feeds, since<br>
the 1,3-butylene glycol has high purity and does not<br>
issue any problematic odor or exhibit any disagreeable<br>
taste.<br><br>
Characteristic features of the sixth invention<br>
group will next be described.<br>
The sixth invention group provides a process for<br>
producing butanol, which includes, when acetaldols are<br>
synthesized from acetaldehyde and the acetaldols are<br>
hydrogenated, hydrogenating, during a hydrogenation step,<br>
crotonaldehyde which is by-produced during synthesis of<br>
the acetaldols to thereby allow by-production of<br>
butanol; subjecting the by-produced butanol to<br>
distillation for separating impurities; and subjecting<br>
the resultant butanol to chemical treatment, and then to<br>
distillation. The sixth invention group also provides a<br>
process for producing butyl acetate from the above-<br>
produced butanol and acetic acids.<br>
When 1,3-butylene glycol is produced from<br>
acetaldehyde serving as a starting material, during<br>
condensation of acetaldehyde in the presence of a basic<br>
catalyst, acetaldols are produced and a small amount of<br>
crotonaldehyde is by-produced. Acetaldols have been<br>
defined in connection with the first invention group.<br>
As described in connection with the first invention<br>
group, a mixture of acetaldehyde and paraldols produced<br>
through thermal decomposition of aldoxane can be used,<br>
and crotonaldehyde is further by-produced during the<br>
thermal decomposition.<br>
During synthesis of acetaldol, crotonaldehyde (1-<br><br>
10 % by weight, usually 2-5 % by weight) and other by-<br>
products (about 1-5 % by weight) are by-produced.<br>
A solution produced through synthesis of acetaldols<br>
is provided in the hydrogenation step described<br>
hereinafter, and the solution is hydrogenated in the<br>
presence of a catalyst.<br>
It is to be noted that in the sixth invention group,<br>
after synthesis of acetaldols, when a large amount of<br>
unreacted acetaldehyde is recovered through distillation<br>
and the acetaldehyde is recycled in the condensation<br>
step, a portion of crotonaldehyde can be separated and<br>
recovered. The separated and recovered crotonaldehyde<br>
is added to acetaldols, which is a bottom solution when<br>
acetaldehyde is recovered through distillation, and the<br>
recovered crotonaldehyde and crotonaldehyde remaining in<br>
the bottom solution may be utilized for by-production of<br>
butanol in a hydrogenation step.<br>
Hydrogenation step<br>
The thus-produced acetaldols and crotonaldehyde are<br>
provided to a hydrogenation step together with non-<br>
recovered acetaldehyde, other by-products, and water,<br>
etc.<br>
The hydrogen, catalyst, and apparatus employed in<br>
hydrogenation of acetaldols, the reaction temperature,<br>
and the reaction pressure have been described in<br>
connection with the first invention group.<br><br>
Hydrogenation is carried out such that the content<br>
of the aldehyde groups remaining in a hydrogenation<br>
reaction crude mixture (which may be referred to as<br>
"hydrogenation crude mixture) becomes 200 ppm by weight<br>
or less, preferably 50 ppm by weight or less.<br>
After hydrogenation reaction, the catalyst is<br>
separated from the hydrogenation crude mixture. The<br>
resultant hydrogenation crude mixture contains 1,3-<br>
butylene glycol, butanol, isopropyl alcohol, ethanol,<br>
water, other low-boiling-point substances, and other<br>
high-boiling-point substances, and the crude mixture is<br>
provided to a purification step.<br>
Purification step<br>
The resultant hydrogenation crude mixture is<br>
subjected to distillation, to thereby yield a distillate<br>
(A) and obtain 1,3-butylene glycol and large amounts of<br>
high-boiling-point substances as bottom products. The<br>
distillate (A) contains butanol, ethanol, water, other<br>
low-boiling-point substances, a small amount of 1,3-<br>
butylene glycol, and small amounts of other high-<br>
boiling-point substances.<br>
The bottom solution containing 1,3-butylene glycol<br>
is further purified, to thereby yield 1,3-butylene<br>
glycol as a final product.<br>
Butanol purification step<br><br>
On the other hand, the distillate (A) is further<br>
subjected to distillation, to thereby separate, as a<br>
distillate, low-boiling-point components (B)<br>
(predominantly containing ethanol, water, and other low-<br>
boiling-point substances), and to yield a bottom<br>
solution (C) (predominantly containing butanol and<br>
containing small amounts of other high-boiling-point<br>
substances).<br>
Conventionally, the bottom solution (C) is<br>
subjected to distillation and purification without any<br>
treatments, to thereby yield by-produced butanol as a<br>
final product. However, the quality of the thus-<br>
obtained butanol is unsatisfactory in terms of the<br>
results of a chameleon test or sulfuric acid coloring<br>
test.<br>
In the sixth invention group, after the bottom<br>
solution (C) is subjected to chemical treatment, the<br>
resultant solution is subjected to distillation, to<br>
thereby separate low-boiling-point components (b) and<br>
high-boiling-point components (c), thereby yielding a<br>
purified butanol.<br>
Examples of the aforementioned chemical treatment<br>
include alkali treatment, reduction treatment, oxidation<br>
treatment, and a combination of at least two of these<br>
treatments.<br>
(I) Examples of the alkali treatment include<br>
treatment making use of an aqueous solution of, for<br>
example, lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, or<br>
potassium hydroxide, and treatment making use of an<br>
alcohol (e.g., ethanol or butanol) solution of such a<br>
hydroxide. Alkali treatment by use of a sodium<br>
hydroxide aqueous solution is preferred.<br>
When sodium hydroxide treatment is carried out, a<br>
0.5-5 % by weight sodium hydroxide aqueous solution is<br>
added to the bottom solution (C) such that the content<br>
of sodium hydroxide in the solution is 1-2 % by weight,<br>
and the resultant solution is heated at 90-130°C for<br>
0.5-10 hours.<br>
(II) Examples of the reduction treatment include a<br>
treatment making use of an aqueous solution or alcohol<br>
solution of a reducing agent such as sodium borohydride,<br>
lithium borohydride, or lithium aluminum hydride; and a<br>
treatment making use of an aqueous solution of acetic<br>
acid-iron or an alcohol solution of sodium hydroxide-<br>
zinc. Reduction treatment using a sodium borohydride<br>
aqueous solution is preferred.<br>
When sodium borohydride treatment is carried out, a<br>
0.1-2 % by weight sodium borohydride aqueous solution is<br>
added to the bottom solution (C) such that the content<br>
of sodium borohydride in the solution is 0.5-1%, and the<br>
resultant solution is heated at 90-130°C for 0.5-10<br>
hours, preferably 0.5-2 hours.<br>
(III) Examples of the oxidation treatment include<br>
an ozone treatment.<br><br>
When the ozone treatment is carried out, 0.01-10 %<br>
by volume ozone is generated in air or oxygen by use of<br>
an ozone generating apparatus, and the resultant ozone-<br>
containing gas is fed to the bottom solution (C), to<br>
thereby subject impurities, which cause lowering of the<br>
quality of butanol, to ozone oxidation at room<br>
temperature.<br>
The solution which has undergone chemical treatment<br>
is further subjected to distillation, to thereby<br>
separate the low-boiling-point components (b) and the<br>
high-boiling-point components (c), thereby yielding a<br>
purified butanol (a).<br>
No particular limitation is imposed on the order of<br>
separation of the low-boiling-point components (b) and<br>
the high-boiling-point components (c). For example, it<br>
may be the case that the low-boiling-point components<br>
(b) are distilled off first, and subsequently the<br>
purified butanol (a) is distilled out and separated from<br>
the high-boiling-point components <c alternatively></c>
it may be the case that butanol is separated from the<br>
high-boiling-point components (c), and subsequently the<br>
low-boiling-point components (b) are distilled off from<br>
the butanol, to thereby yield the purified butanol (a)<br>
as a bottom product.<br>
Distillation may be carried out by means of a<br>
batch-type process or a continuous process.<br>
In the case of continuous distillation, for example,<br><br>
the low-boiling-point components (b) are distilled off,<br>
and then butanol is distilled and separated from the<br>
high-boiling-point components (c).<br>
The low-boiling-point components (b) are distilled<br>
off by distillation under the following conditions.<br>
Pressure: reduced or ambient pressure, reflux ratio: 1-<br>
10, cut percentage of low-boiling-point components: 5-<br>
20 % by weight with respect to a fed solution.<br>
The purified butanol (a) is obtained as a<br>
distillate and separated from the high-boiling-point<br>
components (c) under the following conditions.<br>
Pressure: reduced or ambient pressure, reflux ratio:<br>
0.2-3, cut percentage of high-boiling-point components:<br>
5-20 % by weight with respect to a fed solution.<br>
When the amount of the bottom solution (C) is not<br>
overly large, the solution is stored in a storage tank,<br>
and when the amount of the stored solution reaches a<br>
predetermined level, the solution is subjected to<br>
chemical treatment and batch distillation.<br>
In the case of batch-type distillation, a<br>
distillation tower including about 40 actual plates is<br>
used, and the low-boiling-point components (b) are<br>
distilled under the following conditions: tower top<br>
pressure: 300-760 torr, reflux ratio: 2-5, bottom<br>
solution temperature: 80-130°C, and then the purified<br>
butanol (a) is distilled at the same tower top pressure<br>
and reflux ratio and at a bottom solution temperature of<br><br>
90-150°C.<br>
Purified butanol as a by-product produced through<br>
the process of the sixth invention group exhibits a<br>
chameleon test measurement value of 15-25 minutes;<br>
therefore, it is clear that the quality of the inventive<br>
butanol is greatly improved as compared with butanol<br>
produced through a conventional process, which typically<br>
exhibits a chameleon test measurement value of zero<br>
minutes.<br>
The specification to be met by butanol as a product<br>
is APHA of 50 or less as measured by a sulfuric acid<br>
coloring test. Purified butanol as a by-product<br>
obtained by the sixth invention group exhibits APHA of<br>
30-35; therefore, it is clear that the quality of the<br>
inventive butanol is improved as compared with butanol<br>
produced through a conventional process, which exhibits<br>
APHA of 100-200.<br>
Production of butyl acetate<br>
Through a known method, the above-obtained purified<br>
butanol (a) is reacted with acetic acids, to thereby<br>
produce butyl acetate. Examples of the acetic acids<br>
include acetic acid, acetic anhydride, and acetic acid<br>
chloride, and acetic acid is preferably used.<br>
For example, the purified butanol (a) is reacted<br>
with acetic acid in the presence or absence of a<br>
catalyst to thereby yield a crude butyl acetate, and<br><br>
then distillation of the crude butyl acetate is carried<br>
out, to thereby produce a purified butyl acetate.<br>
Examples of the catalyst include sulfuric acid and<br>
heteropoly-acid, etc.<br>
The esterification temperature is 70-150°C,<br>
preferably 90-130°C. The reaction time is 0.5-5 hours,<br>
preferably 1.5-3 hours.<br>
Butyl acetate as a product produced through the<br>
process of the sixth invention group exhibits APHA of<br>
20-30 as measured by a sulfuric acid coloring test;<br>
therefore, it is clear that the quality of the butyl<br>
acetate is improved as compared with butyl acetate<br>
produced through a conventional process, which exhibits<br>
APHA of 70-90.<br>
Examples<br>
Examples for the first invention group<br>
The inventions of the first invention group will be<br>
next described in more detail by way of Examples, which<br>
should not be construed as limiting the inventions<br>
thereto. It is to be noted that unless otherwise<br>
specified, the term "part(s)" used in the Examples<br>
refers to "part(s) by weight." The below-described<br>
evaluation methods were employed.<br>
1. Potassium permanganate color-fading time (may be<br>
referred to as "chameleon test measurement value"): the<br>
time is measured according to JIS K1351 3.10 (unit:<br>
minute)<br><br>
2. Odor evaluation rating: rating "1" is assigned<br>
to 1,3-butylene glycol which issues no odor, rating "5"<br>
is assigned to 1,3-butylene glycol which issues minimal<br>
odor, rating "10" is assigned to 1,3-butylene glycol<br>
which issues a slight odor, and rating of an evaluation<br>
sample (i.e., 1,3-butylene glycol) is determined on the<br>
basis of the results of relative evaluation. Odor<br>
evaluation was performed as follows. An evaluation<br>
sample is mixed with water at a ratio of 1:1, the<br>
resultant mixture is placed in a ground stopper reagent<br>
bottle, the bottle is sealed and allowed to stand at<br>
room temperature, and then the sample is smelled<br>
promptly in air and relative comparison of the odor is<br>
performed.<br>
3. Time-course deterioration test: a sample is<br>
placed in a ground stopper bottle, the vapor phase<br>
portion in the bottle is subjected to nitrogen sealing,<br>
and then the bottle is sealed. After the bottle is<br>
placed in a thermostatic chamber at 40°C for three<br>
months, the sample in the bottle is subjected to<br>
measurement of potassium permanganate color-fading time<br>
and odor evaluation.<br>
(Examples 1-1 and 1-2)<br>
The process of the first invention group will be<br>
described by way of Examples and with reference to the<br>
flowsheet shown in Fig. 1. Acetaldol (100 parts) and<br><br>
hydrogen (6.5 parts) serving as raw materials were<br>
placed in a reactor (not illustrated in the Fig. 1).<br>
The reactor was maintained at a temperature of 125-135°C<br>
and a pressure of 150 Kg/cm2. A Raney nickel (3.5 parts)<br>
serving as a catalyst was added to the reactor. A crude<br>
reaction mixture was removed from the reactor, the<br>
catalyst was separated from the mixture, and the<br>
resultant mixture was neutralized with sodium hydroxide.<br>
Subsequently, alcohols were removed from the neutralized<br>
mixture, and the resultant crude 1,3-butylene. glycol was<br>
fed into a dehydration tower 1-1 shown in Fig. 1.<br>
Through the top of the dehydration tower, water (15<br>
parts) was added with respect to the fed solution (100<br>
parts), dehydration was carried out at a pressure of 50<br>
torr, and a crude 1,3-butylene glycol containing water<br>
in an amount of 0.5 % by weight or less was obtained<br>
from the bottom of the distillation tower. The thus-<br>
dehydrated crude 1,3-butylene glycol was then fed into a<br>
salt-removal tower 1-2. Salts, high-boiling-point<br>
substances, and a portion of 1,3-butylene glycol (total<br>
5 parts on the basis of 100 parts of the fed solution)<br>
were discharged, as a residue, from the bottom of the<br>
salt-removal tower. From the top of the salt-removal<br>
tower, 1,3-butylene glycol, low-boiling-point substances,<br>
and a portion of high-boiling-point substances (total 95<br>
parts) were distilled.<br>
The 1,3-butylene glycol, low-boiling-point<br><br>
substances, and high-boiling-point substances distilled<br>
from the salt-removal tower 1-2 were fed into a<br>
distillation tower 1-3 for removal of high-boiling-point<br>
substances, and the high-boiling-point substances and a<br>
portion of 1,3-butylene glycol (total 20 parts) were<br>
discharged from the bottom of the distillation tower.<br>
1,3-Butylene glycol and low-boiling-point substances<br>
(total 80 parts) were distilled off from the top of the<br>
distillation tower, and then fed into an alkali reactor<br>
1-4. A 10 % by weight sodium hydroxide aqueous solution<br>
was added to the fed solution such that the<br>
concentration of sodium hydroxide in the solution was<br>
0.2 % by weight. In the alkali reactor, reaction was<br>
carried out at a reaction temperature of 120 C for a<br>
residence time of 20 minutes (Example 1-1). In Example<br>
1-2, the procedure of Example 1-1 was repeated, except<br>
that, in the alkali reactor, the reaction temperature<br>
and the residence time were changed to 100°C and 30<br>
minutes, respectively. A crude reaction mixture<br>
obtained from the alkali reactor was fed into an alkali-<br>
removal tower 1-5. Alkali, high-boiling-point<br>
substances, and a portion of 1,3-butylene glycol (total<br>
10 parts on the basis of 100 parts of the fed solution)<br>
were discharged from the bottom of the alkali-removal<br>
tower. 1,3-Butylene glycol and low-boiling-point<br>
substances (total 90 parts) were distilled from the top<br>
of the alkali-removal tower, and then fed into the<br><br>
subsequent final product distillation tower. Low-<br>
boiling-point substances and a portion of 1,3-butylene<br>
glycol (total 10 % by weight on the basis of 100 parts<br>
of the fed solution) were obtained as a distillate from<br>
the top of the final product distillation tower 1-6.<br>
From the bottom of the distillation tower, 1,3-butylene<br>
glycol was obtained as a product.<br>
The 1,3-butylene glycol was subjected to<br>
measurement of potassium permanganate color-fading time<br>
and odor evaluation immediately after production and at<br>
a period of three months after production. The results<br>
are shown in Table 1-1.<br>
(Comparative Example 1-1)<br>
The procedure of Example 1-1 was repeated until the<br>
step in which the 1,3-butylene glycol, low-boiling-point<br>
substances, and high-boiling-point substances obtained<br>
as a distillate from the salt-removal tower 1-2 were fed<br>
into the distillation tower 1-3 for removal of high-<br>
boiling-point substances. Subsequently, 1,3-butylene<br>
glycol and low-boiling-point substances were obtained as<br>
a distillate from the top of the distillation tower 1-3,<br>
and the resultant distillate was fed into the final<br>
product distillation tower. Low-boiling-point<br>
substances and a portion of 1,3-butylene glycol (total<br>
10 % by weight on the basis of 100 parts of the fed<br>
solution) were obtained as a distillate from the top of<br><br>
the final product distillation tower 1-6. From the<br>
bottom of the distillation tower, 1,3-butylene glycol<br>
was obtained as a final product.<br>
Immediately after production, the odor evaluation<br>
rating of the 1,3-butylene glycol was 3, and the<br>
potassium permanganate color-fading time of the 1,3-<br>
butylene glycol was 15 minutes. The 1,3-butylene glycol<br>
was subjected to time-course deterioration test at 40°C.<br>
At a period of three months after production, the<br>
potassium permanganate color-fading time decreased to 3<br>
minutes, the odor evaluation rating was 10, and the 1,3-<br>
butylene glycol issued a slight odor. The results are<br>
shown in Table 1-1.<br>
Examples for the second invention group<br>
The inventions of the second invention group will<br>
next be described in more detail by way of Examples,<br>
which should not be construed as limiting the inventions<br>
thereto.<br>
Odor evaluation method: 1,3-butylene glycol<br>
immediately after production or 1,3-butylen glycol which<br>
has been stored for a predetermined period of time is<br>
used as an evaluation sample; and rating "1" is assigned<br>
to 1,3-butylene glycol which issues no odor, rating "5"<br>
is assigned to 1,3-butylene glycol which issues minimal<br>
odor, rating "10" is assigned to 1,3-butylene glycol<br>
which issues a slight odor, and rating (1 to 10) of an<br>
evaluation sample is determined on the basis of the<br>
results of relative evaluation.<br>
Odor evaluation was performed as follows. 1,3-<br>
Butylene glycol is mixed with water at a volume ratio of<br>
1:1, the resultant mixture is placed in a ground stopper<br>
reagent bottle, the bottle is sealed and allowed to<br>
stand at room temperature, and then the sample is<br>
smelled promptly in air and relative comparison of the<br>
odor is performed. When the aforementioned rating of<br>
1,3-butylene glycol is 10 or more, the 1,3-butylene<br>
glycol is not passed in terms of odor.<br>
(Example 2-1)<br>
A para-acetaldol reaction mixture was obtained<br>
through condensation of acetaldehyde in the presence of<br>
a sodium hydroxide aqueous solution, and neutralization<br>
of the reaction mixture was carried out. A portion of<br><br>
unreacted acetaldehyde was recovered from the<br>
neutralized mixture, and the resultant crude reaction<br>
mixture was fed into a continuous suspension bubble<br>
tower in which a Raney nickel having the below-described<br>
properties was suspended in the mixture. Subsequently,<br>
hydrogenation was carried out under the below-described<br>
conditions, the Raney nickel was removed through<br>
filtration, and a hydrogenation crude mixture was<br>
obtained.<br>
The Raney nickel contains nickel in an amount of<br>
49 % by weight during alloying, and it showed a grain<br>
size distribution of (grains having a size of more than<br>
7 4 µm (3.3%), grains having a size of 43 µm to 74 µm<br>
(17.4%), and grains having a size of 43 µm or less<br>
(79.2%)). After development, the Raney nickel contains<br>
aluminum in an amount of 8 % by weight, and exhibits an<br>
acetone hydrogenation activity of 2,500 ml/g-Ni/hr and a<br>
phenol hydrogenation activity of 600 ml/g-Ni/hr.<br>
The catalyst (10 parts by weight) and hydrogen (6<br>
parts by weight) were added to acetaldols (100 parts by<br>
weight), and hydrogenation was carried out under the<br>
following conditions: residence time: 80 minutes,<br>
reaction temperature: 135°C, reaction pressure: 140 atm.<br>
The hydrogenation crude mixture (5 ml) was sampled<br>
in a test tube, and a BPB-added hydroxylamine<br>
hydrochloride solution (5 ml)—which had been prepared<br>
in advance—was added to the crude mixture, and then<br><br>
mixed. The time required for changing the color of the<br>
test solution from blue to yellow was 16 hours.<br>
The hydrogenation crude mixture was subjected to<br>
alcohol-removal treatment, to thereby remove ethanol and<br>
butanol. Through azeotropic distillation with water,<br>
components causing odor were separated from the<br>
resultant crude mixture, and the resultant mixture was<br>
subjected to thin-film evaporation, to thereby remove<br>
substances neutralized with the base during the<br>
condensation step, the hydrogenation catalyst, and<br>
thermally decomposable high-boiling-point substances.<br>
Subsequently, the resultant solution was fed into a<br>
continuous distillation tower including 20 plates, and<br>
distillation was carried out under the following<br>
conditions: bottom solution temperature: 150 C, tower<br>
top pressure: 20 torr, to thereby yield 1,3-butylene<br>
glycol as a distillate while high-boiling-point<br>
substances (15 % by weight on the basis of the fed<br>
solution (100 % by weight)) were allowed to remain in<br>
the distillation tower. The distilled 1,3-butylene<br>
glycol was fed into a continuous distillation tower<br>
including a packed bed corresponding to 20 plates, and<br>
then distillation was carried out under the following<br>
conditions: bottom solution temperature: 115°C, tower<br>
top pressure: 15 torr, and reflux ratio: 1.5, to thereby<br>
remove low-boiling-point substances (15 % by weight on<br>
the basis of the fed solution (100 % by weight)),<br><br>
thereby yielding a purified 1,3-butylene glycol. The<br>
odor evaluation rating of the purified 1,3-butylene<br>
glycol was 1 immediately after production, and was 5<br>
after storage for three months; i.e., the 1,3-butylene<br>
glycol can be used as a material for cosmetics.<br>
(Example 2-2)<br>
The procedure of Example 2-1 was repeated, except<br>
that the following Raney nickel was used, to thereby<br>
obtain 1,3-butylene glycol. The Raney nickel contains<br>
nickel in an amount of about 51 % by weight during<br>
alloying, contains aluminum in an amount of 7 % by<br>
weight after development, and exhibits an acetone<br>
hydrogenation activity of 4,300 ml/g-Ni/hr and a phenol<br>
hydrogenation activity of 1,200 ml/g-Ni/hr.<br>
It is to be noted that the hydrogenation crude<br>
mixture (5 ml) was sampled in a test tube, and a BPB-<br>
added hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution (5 ml)—which<br>
had been prepared in advance—was added to the crude<br>
mixture, and then mixed. The time required for changing<br>
the color of the test solution from blue to yellow was<br>
4 8 hours. The odor evaluation rating of the above-<br>
obtained purified 1,3-butylene glycol was 1 immediately<br>
after production, and was 3 after storage for three<br>
months; i.e., the 1,3-butylene glycol can be used as a<br>
material for cosmetics.<br><br>
(Comparative Example 2-1)<br>
The procedure of Example 2-1 was repeated, except<br>
that the following Raney nickel was used, to thereby<br>
obtain 1,3-butylene glycol. The Raney nickel contains<br>
nickel in an amount of about 50 % by weight during<br>
alloying, contains aluminum in an amount of 7 % by<br>
weight after development, and exhibits an acetone<br>
hydrogenation activity of 1,500 ml/g-Ni/hr and a phenol<br>
hydrogenation activity of 350 ml/g-Ni/hr.<br>
It is to be noted that the hydrogenation crude<br>
mixture (5 ml) was sampled in a test tube, and a BPB-<br>
added hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution (5 ml)—which<br>
had been prepared in advance—was added to the crude<br>
mixture, and then mixed. The discoloration time of the<br>
test solution was 0.8 hour. The odor evaluation rating<br>
of the above-obtained purified 1,3-butylene glycol was 5<br>
immediately after production, and was 10 after storage<br>
for three months.<br>
Examples for the third invention group<br>
The inventions of the third invention group will<br>
next be described in more detail by way of Examples,<br>
which should not be construed as limiting the inventions<br>
thereto.<br>
(Example 3-1)<br>
An acetaldehyde aqueous solution<br><br>
(acetaldehyde/water = 90/10 by weight) (500 parts by<br>
weight), which had been prepared in advance, was placed<br>
in a 1-liter aldol condensation reactor equipped with a<br>
jacket, and then cooled to 15-20°C. Subsequently, a<br>
0.5% sodium hydroxide aqueous solution (10 parts by<br>
weight) was gradually added dropwise to the acetaldehyde<br>
aqueous solution while the solution was stirred<br>
vigorously, and then the resultant mixture was allowed<br>
to react at a reaction temperature of 20°C for seven<br>
hours. Subsequently, the resultant reaction mixture was<br>
neutralized with a 10 % by volume diluted acetic acid<br>
aqueous solution in a neutralization bath, and the<br>
resultant mixture was subjected to aging for two hours.<br>
Then, the resultant mixture was continuously fed to an<br>
aldoxane decomposition tower, and thermal decomposition<br>
was carried out.<br>
A distillate containing acetaldehyde,<br>
crotonaldehyde, and water was discharged from the top of<br>
the aldoxane decomposition tower, and a bottom solution<br>
containing acetaldols including aldoxane and paraldols<br>
as a primary component, remaining crotonaldehyde and<br>
other substances as a secondary component, and water was<br>
continuously discharged from the bottom of the tower.<br>
In an intermediate bath, the acidity of the bottom<br>
solution was adjusted to 2 by use of the aforementioned<br>
diluted acetic acid solution, and the resultant solution<br>
was used as a raw material for hydrogenation.<br><br>
The thus-obtained raw material for hydrogenation<br>
was continuously fed to a continuous suspension bubble<br>
tower (made from carbon steel) in which a Raney nickel<br>
serving as a hydrogenation catalyst was suspended in the<br>
raw material, and hydrogenation was carried out under<br>
the below-described reaction conditions. Subsequently,<br>
the Raney nickel was removed through filtration, and a<br>
hydrogenation crude mixture was obtained.<br>
The catalyst (10 parts by weight) and hydrogen (6<br>
parts by weight) were added to acetaldols (100 parts by<br>
weight) in the raw material for hydrogenation, and<br>
hydrogenation was carried out under the following<br>
conditions: residence time: 80 minutes, reaction<br>
temperature: 135°C, reaction pressure: 140 atm. After<br>
the hydrogenation was continuously carried out for 24<br>
hours, the yield of 1,3-butylene glycol in the<br>
hydrogenation crude mixture was 85 % by weight, and the<br>
by-production percentage of butanol was 1.8 % by weight.<br>
(Example 3-2)<br>
The procedure of Example 3-1 was repeated, except<br>
that the acidity of the bottom solution was adjusted to<br>
10 by use of a 10 % by volume diluted acetic acid<br>
solution in an intermediate bath, and the resultant<br>
solution was used as a raw material for hydrogenation.<br>
After hydrogenation reaction was continuously<br>
carried out for 24 consecutive hours, the yield of 1,3-<br><br>
butylene glycol in a hydrogenation crude mixture was<br>
84 % by weight. After production of 1,3-butylene glycol<br>
was carried out for 2,000 hours, the hydrogenation<br>
reactor was observed and no corrosion was found.<br>
(Comparative Example 3-1)<br>
The procedure of Example 3-1 was repeated, except<br>
that the bottom solution was not acidified in an<br>
intermediate bath, and was used as a raw material for<br>
hydrogenation without any treatments.<br>
After hydrogenation reaction was continuously<br>
carried out for 24 hours, the yield of 1,3-butylene<br>
glycol in a hydrogenation crude mixture was 50 % by<br>
weight. The used hydrogenation catalyst was removed<br>
from the hydrogenation reactor, washed with water, dried,<br>
and then subjected to analysis. The analysis results<br>
reveal that polycondensation of the raw material for<br>
hydrogenation proceeded in the Raney nickel catalyst,<br>
and the properties of the catalyst were lowered.<br>
(Comparative Example 3-2)<br>
The procedure of Example 3-1 was repeated, except<br>
that the acidity of the bottom solution was adjusted so<br>
as to fall within a range of 95 to 105 by use of acetic<br>
acid in an intermediate bath, and the resultant solution<br>
was used as a raw material for hydrogenation.<br>
After hydrogenation reaction was continuously<br><br>
carried out for 24 hours, the yield of 1,3-butylene<br>
glycol in a hydrogenation crude mixture was 80 % by<br>
weight, and the by-production percentage of butanol was<br>
increased to 3.0 % by weight.<br>
Examples for the fourth invention group<br>
The inventions of the fourth invention group will<br>
next be described in more detail by way of Examples,<br>
which should not be construed as limiting the inventions<br>
thereto.<br>
Odor evaluation method: rating "1" is assigned to<br>
1,3-butylene glycol which issues no odor, rating "5" is<br>
assigned to 1,3-butylene glycol which issues minimal<br>
odor, rating "10" is assigned to 1,3-butylene glycol<br>
which issues a slight odor, and rating of an evaluation<br>
sample (i.e., 1,3-butylene glycol) is determined on the<br>
basis of the results of relative evaluation.<br>
Odor evaluation was performed as follows. 1,3-<br>
Butylene glycol is mixed with water at a volume ratio of<br>
1:1, the resultant mixture is placed in a ground stopper<br>
reagent bottle, the bottle is sealed and allowed to<br>
stand at room temperature, and then the sample is<br>
smelled promptly in air and relative comparison of the<br>
odor is performed. When the aforementioned rating of<br>
1,3-butylene glycol is 10 or more, the 1,3-butylene<br>
glycol is not passed in terms of odor.<br><br>
(Example 4-1)<br>
An acetaldehyde aqueous solution<br>
(acetaldehyde/water = 90/10 by weight) (500 parts by<br>
weight), which had been prepared in advance, was placed<br>
in a 1-liter aldol condensation reactor equipped with a<br>
jacket, and then cooled to 15-20 C. Subsequently, a<br>
0.5% sodium hydroxide aqueous solution (10 parts by<br>
weight) was gradually added dropwise to the acetaldehyde<br>
aqueous solution while the solution was stirred<br>
vigorously, and then the resultant mixture was allowed<br>
to react while maintaining a reaction temperature at<br>
20 C for seven hours. Subsequently, the resultant<br>
reaction mixture was neutralized with a 10 % by volume<br>
diluted acetic acid aqueous solution in a netitralization<br>
bath, and the resultant mixture was subjected to aging<br>
for two hours. Then, the resultant mixture was<br>
continuously fed to an aldoxane decomposition tower, and<br>
thermal decomposition was carried out.<br>
A distillate containing acetaldehyde,<br>
crotonaldehyde, and water was discharged from the top of<br>
the aldoxane decomposition tower, and a bottom solution<br>
containing para-acetaldols including aldoxane and<br>
paraldol as a primary component, remaining<br>
crotonaldehyde and other substances as a secondary<br>
component, and water was continuously discharged from<br>
the bottom of the tower. In an intermediate bath, the<br>
acidity of the bottom solution was adjusted to 10 by use<br><br>
of the aforementioned diluted acetic acid solution, and<br>
the resultant solution was used as a raw material for<br>
hydrogenation.<br>
Here, acidity refers to an amount (ml) of a 1/10 N<br>
sodium hydroxide aqueous solution to be required for<br>
neutralizing 100 ml of a sample (indicator:<br>
phenolphthalein).<br>
The thus-obtained raw material for hydrogenation<br>
was continuously fed to a continuous suspension bubble<br>
tower in which a Raney nickel serving as a hydrogenation<br>
catalyst was suspended in the raw material, and<br>
hydrogenation was carried out under the below-described<br>
reaction conditions. Subsequently, the Raney nickel was<br>
removed through filtration, and a hydrogenation crude<br>
mixture was obtained.<br>
The catalyst (10 parts by weight) and hydrogen (6<br>
parts by weight) were added to acetaldols (100 parts by<br>
weight) in the raw material for hydrogenation, and<br>
hydrogenation was carried out under the following<br>
conditions: residence time: 80 minutes, reaction<br>
temperature: 135°C, reaction pressure: 140 atm.<br>
Immediately after the hydrogenation, the hydrogenation<br>
crude mixture contained ethanol (8 % by weight), butanol<br>
(1.6 % by weight), and 1,3-butylene glycol (85 % by<br>
weight).<br>
A 10 % by weight sodium hydroxide aqueous solution<br>
was added to the hydrogenation crude mixture immediately<br><br>
after hydrogenation, and the pH of the crude mixture was<br>
adjusted to 11. Subsequently, ethanol and butanol were<br>
distilled off from the crude mixture, the resultant<br>
mixture was subjected to dehydration distillation, and<br>
then neutralized salts, sodium hydroxide, the catalyst,<br>
and thermally decomposable high-boiling-point substances<br>
were separated from the resultant mixture by use of a<br>
thin-film evaporator. Thereafter, the resultant<br>
solution was fed to a continuous distillation tower<br>
including 20 plates, and then distillation was carried<br>
out under the following conditions: bottom solution<br>
temperature: 150 C, and tower top pressure: 20 torr, to<br>
thereby remove high-boiling-point substances (15 % by<br>
weight on the basis of the fed solution (100 % by<br>
weight)) from the bottom of the tower, thereby yielding<br>
1,3-butylene glycol distillate having a purity of 99.2 %<br>
by weight. The recovery percentage of 1,3-butylene<br>
glycol from the hydrogenation crude mixture was 90 % by<br>
weight. Coloring of the 1,3-butylene glycol distillate<br>
was not observed, and the odor evaluation rating of the<br>
1,3-butylene glycol distillate was 5.<br>
(Example 4-2)<br>
The procedure of Example 4-1 was repeated, except<br>
that the pH of the hydrogen crude mixture immediately<br>
after hydrogenation was adjusted to 11.5. The recovery<br>
percentage of 1,3-butylene glycol from the hydrogenation<br><br>
crude mixture was 88 % by weight. Discoloration of 1,3-<br>
butylene glycol distillate was not observed, and the<br>
odor evaluation rating of the 1,3-butylene glycol<br>
distillate was 3.<br>
(Comparative Example 4-1)<br>
An acidic hydrogenation crude mixture immediately<br>
after hydrogenation, which mixture was obtained through<br>
the procedure of Example 4-1, was subjected to alcohol<br>
removal treatment in a manner similar to that of Example<br>
4-1, to thereby remove ethanol, butanol, acetic acid,<br>
etc. Subsequently, neutralized salts, the catalyst, and<br>
thermally decomposable high-boiling-point substances<br>
were removed from the resultant mixture by use of a<br>
thin-film evaporator. Thereafter, the resultant<br>
solution was fed to a continuous distillation tower<br>
including 20 plates, and then distillation was carried<br>
out under the following conditions: bottom solution<br>
temperature: 150°C, and tower top pressure: 20 torr, to<br>
thereby remove high-boiling-point substances (20 % by<br>
weight on the basis of the fed solution (100 % by<br>
weight)) from the bottom of the tower, thereby yielding<br>
1,3-butylene glycol distillate having a purity of 98 %<br>
by weight.<br>
The recovery percentage of 1,3-butylene glycol from<br>
the hydrogenation crude mixture was 83 % by weight. The<br>
purity and yield of the thus-obtained 1,3-butylene<br><br>
glycol were low as compared with those of 1,3-butylene<br>
glycol obtained in Example 4-1.<br>
(Comparative Example 4-2)<br>
The procedure of Example 4-1 was repeated, except<br>
that the pH of the hydrogen crude mixture immediately<br>
after hydrogenation was adjusted to 13. The odor<br>
evaluation rating Of the thus-obtained 1,3-butylene<br>
glycol was about 15, and discoloration of the 1,3-<br>
butylene glycol was observed; i.e., the quality of the<br>
1,3-butylene glycol was low as compared with that of<br>
1,3-butylene glycol obtained in Example 4-1. The 1,3-<br>
butylene glycol of Comparative Example 4-2 was not<br>
passed as a product.<br>
Examples for the fifth invention group<br>
The inventions of the fifth invention group will<br>
next be described in more detail by way of Examples,<br>
which should not be construed as limiting the inventions<br>
thereto.<br>
Odor evaluation method: rating "1" is assigned to<br>
1,3-butylene glycol which issues no odor, rating "5" is<br>
assigned to 1,3-butylene glycol which issues minimal<br>
odor, rating "10" is assigned to 1,3-butylene glycol<br>
which issues a slight odor, and rating of an evaluation<br>
sample (i.e., 1,3-butylene glycol) is determined on the<br>
basis of the results of relative evaluation.<br><br>
Odor evaluation was performed as follows. 1,3-<br>
Butylene glycol is mixed with water at a volume ratio of<br>
1:1, the resultant mixture is placed in a ground stopper<br>
reagent bottle, the bottle is sealed and allowed to<br>
stand at room temperature, and then the sample is<br>
smelled promptly in air and relative comparison of the<br>
odor is performed. When the aforementioned rating of<br>
1,3-butylene glycol is 10 or more, the 1,3-butylene<br>
glycol is not passed in terms of odor.<br>
There was used an experimental ozone generator in<br>
which, when air is fed at a rate of 20 NL (normal<br>
liter)/hour, ozone (0.28 % by volume; i.e., 0.12 g/hour)<br>
can be generated through discharge at 60 V, ozone<br>
(0.63 % by volume; i.e., 0.27 g/hour) can be generated<br>
through discharge at 80 V, and ozone (0.96 % by volume;<br>
i.e., 0.41 g/hour) can be generated through discharge at<br>
100 V.<br>
(Example 5-1)<br>
A para-acetaldol reaction mixture was obtained<br>
through condensation of acetaldehyde in the presence of<br>
a sodium hydroxide aqueous solution, and the reaction<br>
mixture was subjected to neutralization treatment.<br>
Subsequently, unreacted acetaldehyde was separated and<br>
removed from the neutralized mixture, and the resultant<br>
para-acetaldol solution was fed into a continuous<br>
suspension bubble tower in which a Raney nickel serving<br><br>
as a hydrogenation catalyst was suspended in the<br>
solution. Subsequently, hydrogenation was carried out<br>
under the below-described conditions, the Raney nickel<br>
was removed through filtration, and a hydrogenation<br>
crude mixture was obtained.<br>
The catalyst (10 parts by weight) and hydrogen (6<br>
parts by weight) were added to para-acetaldol (100 parts<br>
by weight), and hydrogenation was carried out under the<br>
following reaction conditions: residence time: 80<br>
minutes, reaction temperature: 135 C, reaction pressure:<br>
140 atm.<br>
The hydrogenation crude mixture was subjected to<br>
alcohol-removal treatment, to thereby remove ethanol and<br>
butanol. The resultant mixture was subjected to flash<br>
distillation, to thereby remove neutralized salts, the<br>
catalyst, and thermally decomposable high-boiling-point<br>
substances. Subsequently, the resultant solution was<br>
fed into a continuous distillation tower including 20<br>
plates, and distillation was carried out under the<br>
following conditions: bottom solution temperature: 150 C,<br>
tower top pressure: 20 torr, to thereby remove high-<br>
boiling-point substances (15 % by weight on the basis of<br>
the fed solution (100 % by weight)) from the bottom of<br>
the tower, thereby obtaining 1,3-butylene glycol<br>
distillate (Dl).<br>
The 1,3-butylene glycol distillate (Dl) was fed at<br>
a rate of 2 kg/hour to the bottom of a vertical reactor<br><br>
(internal diameter: 10 cm, height: 25 cm, capacity: 2<br>
liters) including a stirring apparatus. Air containing<br>
0.28 % by volume ozone was blown into the reactor at 20<br>
NL/hour, to thereby subject the 1,3-butylene glycol<br>
distillate to an ozone treatment. The amount of ozone<br>
fed to the reactor was 0.12 g/hour. The odor evaluation<br>
rating of purified 1,3-butylene glycol after the ozone<br>
treatment was 5, and the purified 1,3-butylene glycol<br>
issued minimal odor. The 1,3-butylene glycol distillate<br>
(Dl) was subjected merely to the ozone treatment, and<br>
thus the yield of the purified 1,3-butylene glycol was<br>
high.<br>
(Comparative Example 5-1)<br>
The odor of the 1,3-butylene glycol distillate (Dl)<br>
obtained in Example 5-1 was not itself satisfactorily<br>
improved. Therefore, the 1,3-butylene glycol distillate<br>
(Dl) was fed into a continuous distillation tower<br>
including a packed bed corresponding to 20 plates, and<br>
then distillation was carried out under the following<br>
conditions: bottom solution temperature: 115°C, tower<br>
top pressure: 15 torr, and reflux ratio: 3, to thereby<br>
remove low-boiling-point substances (20 % by weight on<br>
the basis of the fed solution (100 % by weight)),<br>
thereby obtaining a purified 1,3-butylene glycol.<br>
Similarly to the case of the purified 1,3-butylene<br>
glycol of Example 5-1, the thus-obtained purified 1,3-<br><br>
butylene glycol issued minimal odor. However, since the<br>
reflux ratio during removal of low-boiling-point<br>
components was high, and the amount of the removed low-<br>
boiling-point components was large, the distillation<br>
yield of the purified 1,3-butylene glycol of Comparative<br>
Example 5-1 was low as compared with that of the<br>
purified 1,3-butylene glycol of Example 5-1.<br>
(Example 5-2)<br>
The ozone-treated 1,3-butylene glycol obtained in<br>
Example 5-1 was fed into a continuous distillation tower<br>
including a packed bed corresponding to 20 plates, and<br>
then distillation was carried out under the following<br>
conditions: bottom solution temperature: 115 C, tower<br>
top pressure: 15 torr, and reflux ratio: 1.5, to thereby<br>
remove low-boiling-point substances (5 % by weight on<br>
the basis of the fed solution (100 % by weight)),<br>
thereby obtaining a purified 1,3-butylene glycol.<br>
The odor evaluation rating of the purified 1,3-<br>
butylene glycol was 1 immediately after production; i.e.,<br>
the 1,3-butylene glycol issued no odor. The odor<br>
evaluation rating of the 1,3-butylene glycol was 3 after<br>
storage for three months, and thus the 1,3-butylene<br>
glycol can be beneficially used as a material of<br>
cosmetics grade. During distillation, the reflux ratio<br>
was low, and the amount of the removed low-boiling-point<br>
components was small.<br><br>
(Comparative Example 5-2)<br>
The hydrogenation crude mixture obtained in Example<br>
5-1 was subjected to an alcohol-removal treatment, to<br>
thereby remove ethanol and butanol. The resultant<br>
solution was subjected to flash distillation, to thereby<br>
remove the catalyst and thermally decomposable high-<br>
boiling-point substances. Subsequently, a 10 % by<br>
weight sodium hydroxide aqueous solution was added to<br>
the resultant solution such that the amount of sodium<br>
hydroxide in the solution was 0.5 % by weight, and the<br>
resultant solution was subjected to distillation. 1,3-<br>
Butylene glycol was obtained as a distillate from the<br>
top of a distillation tower, and high-boiling-point<br>
substances, sodium hydroxide, and a portion of 1,3-<br>
butylene glycol were removed from the bottom of the<br>
tower. The percentage of the substances removed from<br>
the bottom on the basis of the entirety of the fed<br>
solution was 15 wt.%.<br>
The distillate 1,3-butylene glycol was fed to a<br>
distillation tower, and further subjected to<br>
distillation. Low-boiling-point substances and a<br>
portion of 1,3-butylene glycol were obtained as a<br>
distillate from the top of the tower, and a purified<br>
1,3-butylene glycol was obtained from the bottom of the<br>
tower. The cut percentage in bottom of the substances<br>
obtained as a distillate from the top on the basis of<br><br>
the entirety of the fed solution was 5 % by weight. The<br>
odor evaluation rating of the thus-obtained purified<br>
1,3-butylene glycol was 5, which is the same as that of<br>
the purified 1,3-butylene glycol of Example 5-1.<br>
However, the distillation yield of the 1,3-butylene<br>
glycol of Comparative Example 5-2 is low as compared<br>
with that of the 1,3-butylene glycol of Example 5-1,<br>
since removal of low-boiling-point substances was<br>
carried out. The odor of the 1,3-butylene glycol of<br>
Comparative Example 5-2 was not satisfactorily improved<br>
as compared with that of the 1,3-butylene glycol of<br>
Example 5-2 from which low-boiling-point substances were<br>
removed.<br>
Examples for the sixth invention group<br>
The inventions of the sixth invention group will<br>
next be described in more detail by way of Examples,<br>
which should not be construed as limiting the inventions<br>
thereto.<br>
Test methods for butanol and butyl acetate are<br>
described below.<br>
(1) Chameleon test: the test is carried out<br>
according to JIS K1351 3.10. A potassium permanganate<br>
solution of predetermined concentration is added to a<br>
test sample solution, and the time required for causing<br>
the color of the sample solution to fade into the color<br>
of a standard solution for comparison—the color of the<br><br>
sample solution being faded due to an easily oxidizable<br>
substance—is measured (unit: minutes or hours).<br>
(2) Sulfuric acid coloring test: special-grade<br>
reagent sulfuric acid (40 ml) is added dropwise (2<br>
ml/minute) to a test sample solution of 30 C, the<br>
resultant mixture is stirred and then allowed to stand<br>
for five minutes, and the degree of coloring is measured<br>
by comparison of the color of the sample solution with<br>
that of a standard APHA solution (unit: APHA).<br>
(Example 6-1)<br>
A para-acetaldol reaction mixture was obtained<br>
through condensation of acetaldehyde in the presence of<br>
a sodium hydroxide aqueous solution, and the reaction<br>
mixture was subjected to neutralization treatment.<br>
Subsequently, unreacted acetaldehyde and a portion of<br>
by-produced crotonaldehyde were removed from the thus-<br>
neutralized mixture, to thereby obtain a para-acetaldol<br>
solution (containing the remaining by-produced<br>
crotonaldehyde). A portion of acetaldehyde was<br>
recovered from the above-removed unreacted acetaldehyde,<br>
and the remaining unreacted acetaldehyde and the above-<br>
removed by-produced crotonaldehyde were added to the<br>
para-acetaldol solution. Thereafter, the resultant<br>
para-acetaldol solution was fed into a continuous<br>
suspension bubble tower in which a Raney nickel serving<br>
as a hydrogenation catalyst was suspended in the<br><br>
solution. Subsequently, hydrogenation was carried out<br>
under the below-described conditions, the Raney nickel<br>
was removed through filtration, and a hydrogenation<br>
crude mixture was obtained.<br>
The catalyst (10 parts by weight) and hydrogen (6<br>
parts by weight) were added to para-acetaldol (100 parts<br>
by weight), and hydrogenation was carried out under the<br>
following conditions: residence time: 80 minutes,<br>
reaction temperature: 135 C, reaction pressure: 140 atm.<br>
The hydrogenation crude mixture contained 1,3-<br>
butylene glycol (60 % by weight), ethanol (15 % by<br>
weight), butanol (10 % by weight), water (10 % by<br>
weight), and other low-boiling-point substances and<br>
high-boiling-point substances. The hydrogenation crude<br>
mixture was subjected to distillation, to thereby<br>
distill, from 1,3-butylene glycol, a distillate (Al) (32<br>
parts by weight) including ethanol, butanol, water,<br>
other low-boiling-point substances, and small amounts of<br>
high-boiling-point substances. The distillation for<br>
removal of alcohols was carried out under the following<br>
conditions: pressure: ambient pressure, tower bottom<br>
temperature: 120°C, and reflux ratio: 3.<br>
The distillate (Al) was further subjected to<br>
distillation, to thereby yield low-boiling-point<br>
components (Bl) (including ethanol, water, and other<br>
low-boiling-point substances) as a distillate, and<br>
obtain a bottom solution (C1).<br><br>
The distillation for removal of the low-boiling-<br>
point components was carried out under the following<br>
conditions: pressure: ambient pressure, bottom<br>
temperature: 130°C, and reflux ratio: 5.<br>
A 5 % by weight sodium hydroxide aqueous solution<br>
(2 parts by weight) was added to the bottom solution<br>
(Cl) (100 parts by weight), and the resultant mixture<br>
was heated at 105 C for 1.5 hours.<br>
The thus-heated solution was fed to the bottom of a<br>
distillation tower including 40 actual plates, the tower<br>
being provided in a batch-type distillation apparatus,<br>
and distillation was carried out under the following<br>
conditions: tower top pressure: 760 torr, reflux ratio:<br>
3, and bottom solution temperature: 120-130°C, to<br>
thereby yield low-boiling-point components as a<br>
distillate. Subsequently, a purified butanol was<br>
obtained as a distillate from the tower under the<br>
following conditions: tower top pressure: 760 torr,<br>
reflux ratio: 3, and bottom solution temperature: 130-<br>
140°C. The thus-obtained purified butanol exhibited a<br>
chameleon test value of 20 minutes, and a sulfuric acid<br>
coloring test value (APHA) of 30.<br>
Acetic acid (81 parts by weight) and sulfuric acid<br>
(0.3 parts by weight) were added to the purified butanol<br>
(100 parts by weight), and the resultant mixture was<br>
subjected to esterification reaction at 110 C for two<br>
hours. Subsequently, the catalyst was neutralized with<br><br>
slaked lime, and the resultant reaction mixture was<br>
subjected to filtration. The resultant filtrate was<br>
subjected to batch distillation under the below-<br>
described conditions, to thereby obtain purified butyl<br>
acetate.<br>
The purified butyl acetate was obtained as a<br>
distillate under the following conditions: the number of<br>
plates of distillation tower: 30, tower top pressure:<br>
760 torr, reflux ratio: 5, and bottom solution<br>
temperature: 130-140°C. The purified butyl acetate<br>
exhibited a sulfuric acid coloring test value (APHA) of<br>
20.<br>
(Example 6-2)<br>
A 0.5 % by weight sodium borohydride aqueous<br>
solution (1.0 part by weight) was added to the bottom<br>
solution (Cl) obtained in Example 6-1 (100 parts by<br>
weight), and the resultant mixture was heated at 100°C<br>
for two hours. The thus-heated solution was fed to the<br>
bottom of a distillation tower including 40 actual<br>
plates, the tower being provided in a batch-type<br>
distillation apparatus, and distillation was carried out<br>
under the following conditions: tower top pressure: 760<br>
torr, reflux ratio: 3, and bottom solution temperature:<br>
120-130 C, to thereby yield low-boiling-point components<br>
as a distillate. Subsequently, purified butanol was<br>
obtained as a distillate from the tower under the<br><br>
following conditions: tower top pressure: 760 torr,<br>
reflux ratio: 3, and bottom solution temperature: 130-<br>
140°C.<br>
The thus-obtained purified butanol exhibited a<br>
chameleon test value of 20 minutes, and a sulfuric acid<br>
coloring test value (APHA) of 35. In a manner similar<br>
to that of Example 6-1, a purified butyl acetate was<br>
produced from the purified butanol. The purified butyl<br>
acetate exhibited a sulfuric acid coloring test value<br>
(APHA) of 25.<br>
(Comparative Example 6-1)<br>
The bottom solution (Cl) obtained in Example 6-1<br>
(100 parts by weight) was directly fed to the bottom of<br>
a distillation tower including 40 actual plates without<br>
