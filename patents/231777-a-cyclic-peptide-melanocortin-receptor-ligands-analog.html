				<td>FELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to new melanocortin receptor ligands. These ligands are cyclic peptide analogs that preferably exhibit selectivity for the MC-4 and/or the MC-3 receptors relative to the other melanocortin receptors (in particular the MC-1 receptor). The invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the peptide analogs, and to their use in the prevention or treatment of conditions affected by those receptors in animals, including man.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Melanocortin peptides (melanocorttns) are natural peptide hormones in animals and man that bind to and stimulate MC-receptors. Examples of melanocortins are a-MSH (melanocyte stimulating hormone), ß-MSH, γ-MSH, ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) and their peptide fragments. MSH is mainly known for its ability to regulate peripheral pigmentation (Eberle 1988), whereas ACTH is known to induce steroidoneogenesis (Simpson and Waterman, 1988). The melanocortin peptides also mediate a number of other physiological effects. They are reported to affect motivation, learning, memory, behavior, inflammation, body temperature, pain perception, blood pressure, heart rate, vascular tone, natriuresis, brain blood flow, nerve growth and repair, placental development, aldosterone synthesis and release, thyroxin release, spermatogenesis, ovarian weight, prolactm and FSH secretion, uterine bleeding in women, sebum and pheromone secretion, sexual activity, penile erection, blood glucose levels, intrauterine fetal growth, food motivated behavior, as welt as other events related to parturition.<br>
ACTH and the various MSH peptides share the tetrapeptide core His-Phe-Arg-Trp. All of the peptides are derived from the proteolytic processing of the pro-peptide pre-opiomelanocortin (POMC). In the past several years, five distinct melanocortin receptor subtypes have been identified. These MC receptors belong to the class of 7 transmembrane domain G-protein coupled receptors, The five MC receptors, termed MC-1, MC-2, MC-3, MC-4 and MC-5. all couple in a stimulatory fashion to cAMP. Of these, the MC-2 receptor is the A.CTH receptor, whereas the others constitute subtypes of MSH receptors. The MC-l receptor is<br>
present on melanocytes and melanoma. The MC-2 receptor is present predominantly in the adrenal gland. The mRNA for the MC-3 receptor has been found in the brain, as well as in placental and gut tissues (Gantz et al. 1993a, Desamaud et al. 1994, Roselli Rehfuss et al. 1993). The MC-4 receptor has been found primarily in the brain (Gantz et al. 1993b; Mountjoy et al 1994). The MC-5 receptor is expressed in the brain, as well as in several peripheral tissues (Chhajlani et al 1993; Gantz et al 1994; Griffon et al 1994; Labbu et al. 1994; Barrett et al. 1994; Fathi et al.1995). More recent data from humans indicate that all of the cloned MC-receptors have a wider tissue distribution (Chhajlani, 1996) than originally thought.<br>
As discussed above, the members of the melanocortin receptor family can be differentiated on the basis of their tissue distribution. Both the MC-4 and MC-3 receptors have been localized to the hypothalamus, a region of the brain believed to be involved in the modulation of feeding behavior. Compounds showing selectivity for the MC-4/MC-3 receptors have been shown to alter food intake following intracerebroventricular and peripheral injection in rodents. Specifically, agonists have been shown to reduce feeding, while antagonists have been shown to increase feeding. See, Fan, W. et al., "Role of Melanocortinergic Neurons in Feeding and the Agouti Obesity Syndrome", Nature, 385(6612), pp. 165-8 (Jan. 9, 1997).<br>
The role of the MC-4 receptor subtype has been more clearly defined in the control of eating and body weight regulation in mammals. See, e.g., Huszer, D. et al., "Targeted Disruption of the Melanocortin-4 Receptor Results in Obesity in Mice", Cell, pp. 131-141 (1997); Klebig, M.L. et al., "Ectopic Expression of the Agouti Gene in Transgenic Mice Causes Obesity, Features of Type D Diabetes, and Yellow Fur", Proc. Natl Acad ScL, Vol. 92, pp. 4728-32 (1995); Karbon, W. et al., "Expression and Function of Argt, a Novel Gene Related to Agouti". Abstract from the Nineteenth Annual Winter Nettropeptide Conference (1998); Fan, W. et al., "Role of Melanocortinergic Neurons in Feeding and the Agouti Obesity Syndrome", Nature. Vol. 385, pp. 165-168 (1997); Seely, RJ., "Melanocortin Receptors in Leptin Effects", Nature, Vol. 390, p. 349 (1997); Cotnuzzie, A.G., "A Major Quantitative Trait Locus Determining Serum Leptin Levels and Fat Mass is Located on Human Chromosome 2", Nat. Gen., Vol. 15, pp. 273-276 (1997); Chagnon, Y.C. et al., "Linkage and Association Studies Between the Melanocortin Receptors 4 and 5 Genes and Obesity-Related Phenotypes in the Quebec Family Study", Mol Med., Vol 3(10), pp. 663-673 (1997); Lee, F. and Huszar, D, "Screening Methods for Compounds Useful in the Regulation of Body Weight", World Patent Publication WO 97/47316 (1997); and Shutter, J.R. ct al., "Hypothalamic Expression of ART, a Novel Gene Related to Agouti, is Up-Regulated in Obese and Diabetic Mutant Mice", Gen. &amp; Dev. Vol. 11, pp. 593-602 (1997). Stimulation of the MC-4 receptor by its endogenous ligand, aMSH, produces a satiety signal and<br>
may be the downstream mediator of the leptin satiety signal. It is believed that by providing potent MC-4 receptor agonists, appetite may be suppressed and weight loss benefits may be achieved.<br>
Applicants have discovered a class of compounds that surprisingly have high affinity for the MC-4 and/or the MC-3 receptor subtypes, and that are typically selective for these MC receptors relative to the other melanocortin receptor subtypes, particularly the MC-1 subtype. It is therefore an object of this invention to provide chemical compounds that activate or antagonize the MC-4 and/or the MC-3 receptor subtypes. It is a further object of the invention to provide means for administration of said compounds to animals or man. Still other objects of the invention will be evident from the following disclosure of the invention.<br>

One particularly useful assay is the BioTrak TM cAMP direct enzymeimmunoassay (EIA) system from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, which quantitates the cAMP response of cells to MC ligands. This system allows the simple quantitation of total cellular cAMP measurement in cells exposed to selective ligands. Briefly summarized: HEK cells stably transfected with the MC-1, MC-3 or MC-4 receptors are plated into 96 well microtiter plates and grown overnight. Cells are dosed with the appropriate MC ligand for 1 hour and then lysed. A fraction of the lysed cell extract is transferred to the assay plate. The ELISA assay is performed according to kit instructions. Each plate contains a series of cAMP standards for calculating a standard curve, as well as a full MC agonist as a positive control for each MC receptor. cAMP activity is calculated as a % of the maximum cAMP activity of the full MC agonist control.<br>
As used herein, "MC-4 antagonist" and "MC-3 antagonist" refer to compounds with affinity for the MC-4 receptor or MC-3 receptor, respectively, and blocks stimulation by a known MC agonist. Assays which demonstrate MC-4/MC-3 antagonistic activity of compounds are well known in the art.<br>
As used herein, "MC-3 receptor" and "MC-4 receptor" mean the known MC-3 and MC-4 receptors, their splice variants, and undescribed receptors. MC-3 receptors are described by Gantz et al., supra (human MC-3); Desarnaud et al., supra (mouse MC-3) and L. Reyfuss et al.. "Identification of a Receptor for Gamma Melanotropin and Other Proopiomelanocortin Peptides in the Hypothalamus and Limbic System., Proc. Nail. Acad. Sci. USA, vol. 90, pp. 8856-8860 (1993) (rat MC-3). MC-4 receptors are described by Gantz ct al., supra (human MC-4), J.D.<br>

Sep, vol. 50(3), pp. 583-91 (1996) (rat MC-4) and Takeuchi, S. and Takahashi, S., "Melanocortin Receptor Genes in the Chicken-Tissue Distributions", Gen-Comp-EndocrinoL, vol. 112(2), pp 220-31 (Nov. 1998) (chicken MC-4).<br>
As used herein, "measurable" means the biologic effect is both reproducible and significantly different from the baseline variability of the assay.<br>
A "pharmaceutically-acceptable salt" is a cationic salt formed at any acidic (carboxylic acid) group, or an anionic salt formed at any basic (e.g., amino) group. Many such salts are known in the art, as described in World Patent Publication 87/05297, Johnston et al., published September 11, 1987 incorporated by reference herein. Preferred cationic salts include the alkali metal salts (such as sodium and potassium), and alkaline earth metal salts (such as magnesium and calcium) and organic salts. Preferred anionic salts include the halides (such as chloride salts), sulfonates, carboxylates, phosphates, and the like. Clearly contemplated in such salts are addition salts that may provide an optical center where once there is none. For example, a chiral tarrrate salt may be prepared from the compounds of the invention, and this definition includes such chiral salts.<br>
Such salts are well understood by the skilled artisan, and the skilled artisan is able to prepare any number of salts given the knowledge in the art. Furthermore, it is recognized that the skilled artisan may prefer one salt over another for reasons of solubility, stability, formulation ease and the like. Determination and optimization of such salts is within the purview of the skilled artisan's practice.<br>
As used herein, "selective" means having an activation preference for a specific receptor over other receptors which can be quantified based upon whole cell, tissue, or organism assays which demonstrate receptor activity, such as the cAMP enzyme immunoassay (E1A) system discussed above. A compound's selectivity is determined from a comparison of its EC50 values at the relevant receptors being referenced. As used herein, use of the term "selective over the other MC receptors" means selective with respect to all of the MC-1, MC-2 and MC-5 receptors. For example, a compound having an EC50 of 8 nM at the MC-4 receptor and an EC50 of ≥ 80 nM at the MC-1, MC-2 and MC-5 receptors has a selectivity ratio for the MC-4 receptor over the other MC receptors of at least 1:10. Additionally, it will be recognized that selectivity may also refer to one of the MC-l, MC-2 or MC-5 receptors individually. For example, a compound having an EC50 of 8 nM at the MC-4 receptor and an EC50 of 80 nM at the MC-1 receptor has a selectivity ratio for the MC-4 receptor over the MC-1 receptor of 1:10. Such a compound is selective over the MC-1 receptor, regardless of its EC50 value for MC-2 or MC-5, Selectivity is described in<br>
more detail below and may be determined by using, for example, the software Prism v 2.0 which is available from GraphPad, Inc.<br>
"Spirocycle" is an alkyl or heteroalkyl diradical substituent of an alkyl or heteroalkyl, wherein said diradical substituent is attached geminally and wherein said diradical substituent forms a ring, said ring containing about 4 to about 8 member atoms (carbon or heteroatoms), preferably 5 or 6 member atoms.<br>
"Substituted" refers to one or several hydrogens being substituted, independently, by alkyl. haloginated alkyl, alkenyl, halogenated alkenyl, alkynyl, halogenated alkynyl, cycloalkyl, halogenated cycloalkyl, cycloheteroalkyl, halogenated cycloheteroalkyl, cycloalkenyl, halogenated cycloalkenyl, cycloheteroalkenyl, halogenated cycloheteroalkenyl, aryl, halogenated aryl, heteroaryl, halogenated heteroaryl and/or functional group. Moreover, if a "substituted" structure is a cyclic structure fused with other cyclic structure(s) these latter cyclic structure(s) may also be substituted.<br>
A "solvate" is a complex formed by the combination of a solute (e.g., a cyclic MC-4/MC-3 receptor ligand of the present invention) and a solvent (e.g., water). See J. Honig et al., The Van Nostrand Chemist's Dictionary, p. 650 (1953). Pharmaceutically-acceptable solvents used according to this invention include those that do not interfere with the biological activity of the compound (e.g., water, ethanol, acetic acid, N.N-dimethylformamide and others known or readily determined by the skilled artisan).<br>
II.     The Compounds<br>
The compounds of the present invention are MC-4 and/or MC-3 receptor ligands having a structure according to Formula (I):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein B, X, E, Z, D, G, R, R1, R1', R11, m, n, p, and q are as described in the Disclosure of the Invention section above.<br>
With reference to Formula (I), it is seen that the compounds comprise an important backbone based on the natural amino acid sequence Tyr (or substituted Phe)-Phe-J-M (per the description above, when the first ammo acid is Phe it should be substituted and is preferably Tyr), where J is an amino acid whose side chain is a nitrogen containing group (e.g., Arg, His or Lys) or a derivative thereof, and M is a bicyclic aromatic moiety (e.g., Trp or napthylalamne, or a derivative thereof)- Preferred are those compounds wherein J is Arg or a derivative of Arg and M is Trp or a derivative of Trp. It is noted, as is depicted in Formula (I), that substitution of the natural amino acids is possible without losing the MC-3/ MC-4 ligand properties. In this regard, while reference is made herein to the Phe(Tyr)-Phe-J-M sequence, it is understood that substitution is allowed per the description of Formula (I).<br>
Applicants have found that to obtain optimum agonistic or antagonistic activity, the ring moiety of the compound will preferably comprise from 25 to 27 ring atoms. That is, the ring comprising the depicted residues and the bridging moiety, B, preferably contains from 25 to 27 ring atoms. It will be recognized that additional amino acids or other chemical entities may be included as substituents on the cyclic structure depicted in Formula (I) without negatively impacting interaction with MC-3/MC-4 receptor.<br>
That the compounds of Formula (I) have affinity for the MC-4 and/or the MC-3 receptor is surprising, given that the linear compound BIM-22015 exhibits essentially no affinity for any of the melanocortin receptors, including MC-3 and MC-4, while differing from endogenous a-MSH in the 6-9 region by only the substitution of Tyr for His at position 6 (using natural a-MSH numbering). See, e.g., Schioth, H.B. et al., "Selectivity of [Phe-17], [Ala6] and [D-Ala4,Gln5,Tyr6] Substituted ACTH (4-10) Analogues for the Melanocortin Receptors", Peptides, vol. 18(5), pp. 761-3 (1997).<br>
—Tyr- Phe- Arg —Trp—    BIM.22Q15<br>
678	9<br>
— His - Phe - Arg — Trp	    alpha-MSH<br>
6789<br>
One would have also predicted that Applicants' compounds would lack affinity for these receptors given the common -Tyr-Phe-Arg-Trp- domain the preferred compounds share with BIM-22015. That is, the logical conclusion is that the His at position 6 is critical, or at a minimum that His at position 6 cannot be replaced with a substituted Phe or Tyr. Surprisingly, this is not the case, as Applicants compounds exhibit significant affinity for one or both of the MC-3 and MC-4 receptors. Without being bound by theory, Applicants believe the surprisingly high affinity of the present compounds is due to the shape of these residues induced by the cyclie<br><br>
narure of the molecules. That is, the cyclic aspect of the compounds provides rigidity which allows them to effectively interact with the relevant binding sites of the MC-4/MC-3 receptor. Moreover, it appears that the surprising ability to retain the preferred Tyr-like residue provides desired selectivity relative to the other MC receptors, particularly the MC-1 receptor.<br>
With respect to B, this bridge can be in the form of covalent bond linkages or alternatively can include a salt bridge resulting from the formation of ionic bonds. The bridging moiety can be wholly peptidic in nature (i.e., containing amino acids only), non-peptidic (i.e., containing no amino acids) in nature, or it can include both peptidic and non-peptidic moieties introduced using well known chemistry. The bridge can comprise aliphatic residues, aromatic residues or heteroaromatic residues, or any combination thereof. The bridge preferably comprises at least 2 amino acids, such that the compounds of the present invention comprise at least 6 amino acid residues. Preferably, B will not contain 3 adjacent amino acids that are all are basic ammo acids. In addition, when B comprises two or more Cys residues that form one or more disulfide bonds, said disulfide bond(s) is not necessary for the existence of the cyclic molecule of Formula (I). In other words, cleavage of such disulfide bond(s) does not result in the toss of the nng formed by joining M' and W of Formula (I).<br>
In one embodiment, the bridge will preferably comprise long chain omega-amino acids in which amino and carboxyl groups are separated by from about 4 to about 6 methylene groups or a combination of said omega-amino acids and aminobenzoic acids.<br>
In another embodiment, which is a preferred embodiment, the bridging moiety will contain all covalent bonds, such as an amide bond. For example, the bridge can comprise an amide formed through the chemical coupling of a side-chain amino group of amino acids such as Lys or Om, and a side-chain carboxyl group of the amino acid residue such as Asp or Glu. Alternatively, the bridging moiety can comprise an amide formed between the amino and carboxylate groups attached to the a-carbon of the bridging moiety amino acids. (Hereafter referred to as the "ct-amino" moiety of an amino acid or the "a-carboxyl" moiety of an amino acid.) In another alternative, the bridging moiety can comprise an amide formed between any combination of the side-chain amino group or side-chain carboxyl group and the a-amino and the a-carboxyl moieties. The bridging residues may be amine- or carboxyl-containing structures other than natural amino acids, including, e.g., 6-aminohexanoic acid as an amine-containing residue and succinic acid as a carboxyl-containing residue. Furthermore, the invention allows for bridging of the Tyr-Phc-Arg-Trp core sequence using other types of chemical functionalities. In this case, these bridging residues may contain a variety of groups and substituents, including aliphatic, aromatic and heterocyciic moieties. When covalcntly linked, the bridge can be<br>
connected through a variety of linkages including but not limited to amide, ester, ether, thioether, ammoalkyl or aminoaryl bonds. When B is a covalent bond, preferred are compounds having from about 24 to about 30 ring atoms, more preferred are compounds having from about 25 to about 27 ring atoms.<br>
The bridging moiety can alternatively be an ionic bond/association that favors a cyclic structure. This "ionic" bridge is comprised of salt-forming basic and acid functionalities. For example, the bridge can comprise an ionic bond formed between the side-chain amino group of amino acids such as Lys or Om, and the side-chain carboxyl group of the amino acid residue such as Asp or Glu. Alternatively, the bridging moiety can comprise an ionic bond formed between the ammo and carboxylate groups attached to the a-carbon of the bridging moiety amino acids. In another alternative, the bridging moiety may comprise an a.mide formed between any combination of the side-chain amino group or side-chain carboxyl and the a-amino and the a-carboxyl moieties. Since an ionic bond is typically weaker than a covalent bond, it is easier to distort the topography of a cyclic structure based on such an ionic bond. This distortion may occur when additional groups are attached to the bridging moiety, thereby negatively impacting interaction with the receptor. Thus, the bridging moiety preferably will not be substituted with more than 3 amino acid residues when the moiety is in the form of an ionic bond. In one particularly preferred aspect, when B is an ionic bond, the compounds will have from about 26 to about 29 ring atoms.<br>
It will be recognized that any free peptidic a-carboxy and a-amino groups (i.e., amino acid a-carboxy and a-amino groups) not involved in formation of the ring can optionally be in the form of a carboxyamide or an acylamino moiety, respectively.<br>
In addition to the compounds described by Formula (I), it is envisioned that the core peptide residues can be pegylated to provide enhanced therapeutic benefits such as, for example, increased efficacy by extending half life in vivo. Peptide pegylation methods are well known in the literature.

HI-    Synthesis of the Compounds<br>
The compounds of the invention can be prepared using a variety of procedures.   The starting materials used in preparing the compounds of the invention are known, made by known<br>
methods, or are commercially available. A general reaction for making the compounds is set forth below. Representative examples for synthesizing representative compounds of the present invention are disclosed in Examples 1-18.<br>
According to one general scheme, the claimed peptides are synthesized using Fmoc (9-Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl as protection group for alpha NH:) chemistry followed by deprotection, solution phase cyclization and detailed characterization and purification. One general synthesis scheme for the claimed compounds is as follows:<br>
Fmoc-NH-R1-COOH activation<br>
deprotection          '             coupling<br>
Fmoc-NH-Resin	    H2N-Resin	   Fmoc-NH-R1-CO-NH-Resin<br>
deprotection<br><br>
Fmoc-NH-R2-OC-HN-R1 -CO-NH-Resin<br><br>
coupling<br><br>
H2N-R1-CO-NH-Resin<br><br>
activation<br>
Fmoc-NH-R1-COOH<br>
The R-group designations in the above scheme do not correspond to the R groups used to define the Formula (I) compounds.<br>
Linear Peptide Synthesis: The linear version of the compounds are synthesized with a Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystem Division (PE-ABD) Model 433 automated synthesizer. All the reagents used for peptide synthesis, Fmoc amino acids (except Fmoc-L-Arg-Pbf is from AnaSpec) and resins can be purchased from PE-ABD. Standard 0.1 mmole FastMoc chemistry with single coupling is used. The general Fmoc chemistry protocol for SPPS (solid phase peptide synthesis) includes: 1) cleavage of the Fmoc protection groups with piperidine; 2) activation of the carboxyl group of amino acids; and 3) coupling of the activated amino acids to the amino-terminal of the resin bound peptide chain to form peptide bonds. FastMoc cycles in which amino acids are activated with 2-(lH-benzotriazol-l-yl)-l,l,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU). 1.0 mmole of dry protected amino acid in a cartridge is dissolved in a solution of HBTU, N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIEA), and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) in RN-dimethylformamide (DMF) with additional N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) added. The<br>
activated Fmoc ammo acid is formed almost instantaneously and the solution is transferred directly to the reaction vessel. The step of Fmoc deprotection is monitored and controlled by conductivity measurement. The peptide chain is built on a Rink Amide resin since the C-terminal amide is needed. The acetyl group is added on the N-terminal side of the peptide after the full length of the peptide chain is made. It is accomplished by reaction of acetic anhydrite (4.75% V:V acetic anhydrite, 0.2% HOBt W:V, 2.25% DIEA in NMP) with the a-amino group on N-terminal side of residue. The final synthesis product is washed extensively with NMP and dichloromethane (DCM).<br>
Deprotection: The resins containing synthesized peptides are unloaded from the synthesizer and briefly air-dried. Using 1.5-2.0 ml of the cleavage cocktail (93% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), 2.3% ethanodithiol in water) for 1.5-3.0 hours at room temperature, the peptides are cleaved off the resin and at the same time, the side chain protection groups [O-t-butyl (OtBu) for Asp, Glu, Tyr and Ser, pentamethyldihydrobenzofuran-5-sulfonyl (Pbf) for Arg, t-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) for Trp, Orn, Lys] are removed under the deprotection condition. The cleavage solution is separated from the resin by filtration. The filtrate is then diluted with 15 ml of water. Six rounds of ether extraction are performed to clean the peptide product. The peptide is lyophilized and stored at -20°C before cyclization.<br>
Solution Phase cyclization: The peptide is characterized by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and mass spectrometry (MS) prior to cyclization process. The lyophilized peptide is dissolved in cold DMF with addition of dibasic potassium phosphate. Diphenylphosphoryl azide (DPPA, from Sigma), the cyclization reagent, to peptide molar ratio is 4:1. The reaction vessel is chilled with dry ice when the DPPA is introduced. The overall cyclization reaction is carried out in 4°C for 24 hours with another DPPA addition in 4 hours after the reaction is started. Analytical RP-HPLC and electrospray MS is used to monitor the cyclization reaction. A HP1090 HPLC system with a Vadyc C-8 column with 2.1 mm ID, 15 cm length, 300 A pore size, and 10 urn particle size. A uv detector is used for detection of the cyclization process. With the described cyclization protocol, the reaction is completed within 24 hours.<br>
Purification and Characterization: The cyclized peptide product is then lyophilized to remove DMF solvent. The peptide powder along with phosphate salt, DPPA and other by-products are re-dissolved in 50% acetic acid solution and injected onto a Vydac 1.0 cm I.D. 25 cm length C-8 column with 5 urn particle size, and 300 A pore size for purification. A Beckman System Gold HPLC system with dual wavelength u.v. detector is used. Linear gradient of acetonitrile is<br><br>
programmed and introduced to the column to separate the cyclic peptide product from other substances. The elute is collected by a Pharmacia fraction collector, and the individual separation fractions are subjected to both analytical HPLC and electrospray MS for characterization to ensure the identity and purity.<br>
A variety of additional compounds can be generated using the guidance of the scheme above.<br>
It is recognized that it is preferable to use a protecting group for any reactive functionality such as a carboxyl, hydroxyl and the like. This is standard practice, well within the normal practice of the skilled artisan.<br>
The indicated steps may be varied to increase yield of desired product. The skilled artisan will recognize the judicious choice of reactants, solvents, and temperatures is an important component in any successful synthesis. Determination of optimal conditions, etc. is routine. Thus the skilled artisan can make a variety of compounds using the guidance of the above general description.<br>
It is recognized that the skilled artisan in the art of organic chemistry can readily carry out standard manipulations of organic compounds without further direction; that is, it is well within the scope and practice of the skilled artisan to carry out such manipulations. These include, but are not limited to, reduction of carbonyl compounds to their corresponding alcohols, oxidations of hydroxyls and the like, acylations, aromatic substitutions, both electrophilic and nucleophilic, etherifications, esterification and sapomfication and the like. Examples of these manipulations are discussed in standard texts such as March, Advanced Organic Chemistry (Wiley), Carey and Sundberg, Advanced Organic Chemistry (Vol. 2) and other art that the skilled artisan is aware of.<br>
The skilled artisan will also readily appreciate that certain reactions are best carried out when potentially reactive functionalities on the molecule are masked or protected, thus avoiding any undesirable side reactions and/or increasing the yield of the reaction. Often the skilled artisan utilizes protecting groups to accomplish such increased yields or to avoid the undesired reactions. These reactions are found in the literature and are also well within the scope of the skilled artisan. Examples of many of these manipulations can be found for example in T. Greene, Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis. Of course, amino acids with reactive side chains used as starting materials are preferably blocked to prevent undesired side reactions.<br>
IV.    Melanocortin Functional Activity and Selectivity<br>
Functional activity can be evaluated using various methods known in the art. Examples of such methods are measurement of second messenger responses, in particular cAMP, the use of modified cell systems yielding color reaction upon accumulation of second messenger elements such as cAMP, e.g. as described by Chen et al. 1995 (Anal Biochem; 1995, 226, 349-54), Cytosensor Microphysiometer techniques (see Boyfield et al. 1996), or the study of physiological effects caused by the compounds of the invention may be applied by using the compounds of the invention alone, or in combination with natural or synthetic MSH-peptides.<br>
The compounds of the present invention will interact preferentially (i.e., selectively) to MC-4 and/or MC-3, relative to the other melanocortin receptors. Selectivity is particularly important when the compounds are administered to humans or other animals, to minimize the number of side effects associated with their administration. MC-3/MC-4 selectivity of a compound is defined herein as the ratio of the EC50 of the compound for an MC-1 receptor ("EC50-MC-l") over the ECSO of the compound for the MC-3 (EC50-MC-3) / MC-4 (EC50-MC-4) receptor, the EC50 values being measured as described above. The formulas are as follows:<br>
MC-3 selectivity = [EC50-MC-1] / [EC50-MC-3]<br>
MC-4 selectivity = [EC50-MC-1] / [E50-MC-4]<br>
A compound is defined herein as being "selective for the MC-3 receptor" when the above mentioned ratio "MC-3-selectivity" is at least about 10, preferably at least about 100, and more preferably at least about 500.<br>
A compound is defined herein as being "selective for the MC-4 receptor1' when the above mentioned ratio "MC-4-selectivity" is at least about 10, preferably at least about 100, and more preferably at least about 500.<br>
The following data demonstrate both the agonistic activity and selectivity of the representative compounds of the present invention. <br>

V.     Methods of Use and Compositions:<br>
Based on their ability to agonize or antagonize the MC-4 and/or MC-3 receptor, the present inventions also relates to the use of the ligands of the present invention in methods for treating obesity as well as other body weight disorders, including anorexia and cachexia. The invention further relates to the treatment of disorders relating to behavior, memory (including learning), cardiovascular function, inflammation, sepsis and septic, cardiogenic and hypovolemic<br>
shock, sexual dysfunction, penile erection, muscle atrophy, nerve growth and repair, intrautenne fetal growth, and the like.<br>
The terms treating and treatment are used herein to mean that, at a minimum, administration of a compound of the present invention mitigates a disease state by acting via the MC-3 or MC-4 receptor. Thus, the terms include: preventing a disease state from occurring in a mammal, particularly when the mammal is predisposed to acquiring the disease, but has not yet been diagnosed with the disease; inhibiting progression of the disease state; and/or alleviating or reversing the disease state.<br>
The invention compounds can therefore be formulated into pharmaceutical compositions for use in treatment or prophylaxis of these conditions. Standard pharmaceutical formulation techniques are used, such as those disclosed in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., latest edition and Peptide and Protein Drug Delivery, Marcel Dekker, NY, 1991.<br>
The compositions of the invention comprise:<br>
a.	a safe and effective amount of a compound of Formula (I); and<br>
b.	a pharmaceutically-acceptable excipient.<br>
A "safe and effective amount" of a Formula (I) compound is an amount that is effective to interact with the MC-4 and/or MC-3 receptor, in an animal, preferably a mammal, more preferably a human subject, without undue adverse side effects (such as toxicity, irritation, or allergic response), commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio when used in the manner of this invention. The specific "safe and effective amount" will, obviously, vary with such factors as the particular condition being treated, the physical condition of the patient, the duration of treatment, the nature of concurrent therapy (if any), the specific dosage form to be used, the excipient employed, the solubility of the Formula (I) compound therein, and the dosage regimen desired for the composition.<br>
In addition to the subject compound, the compositions of the subject invention contain one or more pharmaceutically-acceptable excipients. The term "pharmaceutically-acceptable excipient", as used herein, means one or more compatible solid or liquid ingredients which are suitable for administration to an animal, preferably a mammal, more preferably a human. The term "compatible", as used herein, means that the components of the composition are capable of being commingled with the subject compound, and with each other, in a manner such that there is no interaction which would substantially reduce the pharmaceutical efficacy of the composition under ordinary use situations. Pharmaceutically-acceptable excipients must, of course, be of<br>
sufficiently high purity and sufficiently low toxicity to render them suitable for administration to the animal, preferably a mammal, more preferably a human being treated.<br>
Some examples of substances which can serve as pharmaceutically-acceptable excipients or components thereof are sugars, such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; starches, such as corn starch and potato starch; cellulose and its derivatives, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, and methyl cellulose; powdered tragacanth; malt; gelatin; talc; solid lubricants, such as stearic acid and magnesium stearate; vegetable oils, such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil and oil of theobroma; polyols such as propylene glycol, glycerin. sorbitol, mannitol, and polyethylene glycol; agar; alginic acid: wetting agents and lubricants, such as sodium lauryl sulfate; coloring agents; flavoring agents; tabletmg agents, stabilizers; antioxidants; preservatives; pyrogen-free water; isotonic saline; and buffers, such as phosphate, citrate and acetate.<br>
The choice of pharmaceutically-acceptable excipients to be used in conjunction with the subject compound is basically determined by the way the compound is to be administered. If the subject compound is to be injected, the preferred pharmaceutically-acceptable excipient is sterile water, physiological saline, or mixtures thereof, the pH of which has preferably been adjusted to about 4-10 with a pharmaceutical buffer; a compatible suspending agent may also be desirable.<br>
In particular, pharmaceutically-acceptable excipients for systemic administration include sugars, starches, cellulose and its derivatives, malt, gelatin, talc, calcium sulfate, lactose, vegetable oils, synthetic oils, polyols, alginic acid, phosphate, acetate and citrate buffer solutions, emulsifiers, isotonic saline, and pyrogen-free water. Preferred excipients for parenteral administration include propylene glycol, ethyl oleate, pyrrolidone, ethanol, and sesame oil. Preferably, the pharmaceutically-acceptable excipient, in compositions for parenteral administration, comprises at least about 90% by weight of the total composition.<br>
The compositions of this invention are preferably provided in unit dosage form. As used herein, a "unit dosage form" is a composition of this invention containing an amount of a Formula (I) compound that is suitable for administration to an animal, preferably a mammal, more preferably a human subject, in a single dose, according to good medical prac¬tice. These compositions preferably contain from about 1 mg to about 750 mg, more preferably from about 3 mg to about 500 mg, still more preferably from about 5 mg to about 300 mg, of a Formula (I) compound.<br>
The compositions of this invention may be in any of a variety of forms, suitable (for example) for oral, rectal, topical, nasal, ocular, transdermal, pulmonary or parenteral administration. Depending upon the particular route of administration desired, a variety of<br>
which are not critical for the purposes of the subject invention, and can be readily made by a person skilled in the art.<br>
Peroral compositions also include liquid solutions, emulsions, suspensions, and the like. The pharmaceutically-acceptable excipients suitable for preparation of such compositions are well known in the art. Typical components of excipients for syrups, elixirs, emulsions and suspensions include ethanol, glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, liquid sucrose, sorbitol and water. For a suspension, typical suspending agents include methyl cellulose, sodium<br>
carboxymethyl cellulose, Avicel® RC-591, tragacanth and sodium alginate; typical wetting agents include lecithin and polysorbate 80; and typical preservatives include methyl paraben, propyl paraben and sodium benzoate. Peroral liquid compositions may also contain one or more components such as sweeteners, flavoring agents and colorants disclosed above.<br>
Such compositions may also be coated by conventional methods, typically with pH or time-dependent coatings, such that the subject compound is released in the gastrointestinal tract in the vicinity of the desired topical application, or at various times to extend the desired action. Such dosage forms typically include, but are not limited to, one or more of cellulose acetate phthalate, polyvinylacetate phthalate, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose phthalate, ethyl cellulose,<br>
Eudragit® coatings, waxes and shellac.<br>
Because the compounds of the present invention are peptidic in nature, a preferred mode of administration is parenteral (more preferably intravenous injection) or nasal administration, in the form of a unit dose form. Preferred unit dose forms include suspensions and solutions, comprising a safe and effective amount of a Formula I compound. When administered parenterally, the unit dose form will most preferably comprise from about 3 to about 300 mg of the Formula (I) compound.<br>
Compositions of the subject invention may optionally include other drug actives.<br>
Other compositions useful for attaining systemic delivery of the subject compounds include sublingual, buccal and nasal dosage forms. Such compositions typically comprise one or more of soluble filler substances such as sucrose, sorbitol and mannitol; and binders such as acacia, microcrystalline cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose. Glidants, lubricants, sweeteners, colorants, antioxidants and flavoring agents disclosed above may also be included.<br>
VI.    Methods of Administration<br>
As indicated, compositions of this invention can be administered topically or systemically. Systemic application includes any method of introducing a Formula (I)<br>
compound into the tissues of the body, e.g., intra-articular, intrathecal, epidural, intramuscular, transdermal, intravenous, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, sublingual, rectal, nasal, pulmonary, and oral administration. The Formula (I) compounds of the present invention are preferably administered systemically, more preferably parenterally and most preferably via intravenous injection.<br>
The specific dosage of compound to be administered, as well as the duration of treatment, and whether the treatment is topical or systemic are interdependent. The dosage and treatment regimen will also depend upon such factors as the specific Formula (I) compound used, the treatment indication, the ability of the Formula (I) compound to reach minimum inhibitory concentrations at the site of the metalloprotease to be inhibited, the personal attributes of the subject (such as weight), compliance with the treatment regimen, and the presence and severity of any side effects of the treatment.<br>
Typically, for a human adult (weighing approximately 70 kilograms), from about 0.003 mg to about 300 mg, more preferably from about 0,03 mg to about 100 mg, of Formula (I) compound are administered per day for systemic administration. It is understood that these dosage ranges are by way of example only, and that daily administration can be adjusted depending on the factors listed above.<br>
As is known and practiced in the art, all formulations for parenteral administration must be sterile. For mammals, especially humans, (assuming an approximate body weight of 70 kilograms) individual doses of from about 0.001 mg to about 100 mg are preferred.<br>
A preferred method of systemic administration is intravenous delivery. Individual doses of from about 0.01 mg to about 100 mg, preferably from about 0.1 mg to about 100 mg are preferred when using this mode of delivery.<br>
In all of the foregoing, of course, the compounds of the invention can be administered alone or as mixtures, and the compositions may further include additional drugs or excipients as appropriate for the indication.<br>
The compound of the invention can be delivered to the preferred site in the body by using a suitable drug delivery system. Drug delivery systems are well known in the art. For example, a drug delivery technique useful for the compounds of the present invention is the conjugation of the compound to an active molecule capable of being transported through a biological barrier (see e.g. Zlokovic, B.V., Pharmaceutical Research, Vol. 12, pp. 1395-1406 (1995)). A specific example constitutes the coupling of the compound of the invention to fragments of insulin to achieve transport across the blood brain barrier (Fukuta, M., et al. Pharmaceutical Res., Vol. 11. pp. 1681-1688 (1994)). For general reviews of technologies for drug delivery suitable for the<br>
compounds of the invention see Zlokovic, B.V., Pharmaceutical Res., Vol. 12, pp. 1395-1406 (1995) and Pardridge, WM, Pharmacoi ToxicoL Vol. 71, pp. 3-10 (1992).<br>

A.     Synthetic Examples<br>
Example 1 Synthesis of Ac-a[DYfRWGK]-NH2 [M+Hf: 1065.2<br>
Based on the 0.55 mmole/g substitution rate for the Rink Amide resin, 0.182g of the resin is weighted out for 0.1 mmole scale synthesis. The performance of the PE-ABD 433 peptide synthesizer is checked before the run with various flow tests to ensure the accurate reagent delivery. Fmoc amino acids: Asp-OtBu, Tyr-OtBu, Arg-Pbf, Trp-Boc, Lys-Boc, and Giy are purchased commercially in 1 mmole cartridges. Fmoc-ala (311 mg, 1 mmole) and Fmoc-phe (387 mg, 1 mmole) is measured and added in the synthesis cartridges, respectively. The freshly made acetic anhydride solution is loaded on the instrument at 4 bottle position. Other synthesis reagents and solvents are purchased commercially and loaded on the instrument according to the instrument's instruction. A chemistry program called NAc-O.lmmole MonPrePk is used for synthesizing this peptide. The Fmoc deprotection is monitored and controlled by conductivity measurement with set criteria of 5% or less conductivity comparing to previous deprotection<br>
cycle. The overall synthesis yield for this series of peptides (linear) is better than 90%, determined by analytical HPLC.<br>
The resin is air-dried and transferred into a glass vial and a freshly prepared cleavage reagent (2 ml) is added. The deprotection reaction is carried out for 2 hours at room temperature with constant stirring. The supernatant is then separated from the resin by filtration. The resin is sequentially washed with TFA (2x2 ml) and double distilled water. The combined wash solutions are extracted with ether (3x20 ml). The upper (ether) layer is discarded after each extraction. The peptide solution is freeze-dried overnight. The identity of the linear peptide is determined by both MS and HPLC. Expected peptide molecular weight is detected. Analytical HPLC profile indicates that the peptide purity is over 90%.<br>
The peptide powder is dissolved in DMF (15 ml) and K2HPO4 (60 nig) is added. The reaction mixture is cooled in dry-ice and treated with DPPA (70 u.1), agitated for 20 min., and warmed up to 4°C. An additional, equal portion of DPPA is added after 2 hours. The total cyclization reaction proceeds for 24 hours. DMF is then removed by vacuum. Cyclic peptide is re-dissolved in 50% acetic acid and purified by a C8 reverse phase HPLC using a linear gradient of 0-70% solvent B with solvent A in 70 min at a flow rate 3 ml/min. The composition of solvents A and B are as follows: A: 0.1% TFA, 2% acetonitrile in water; B: 0.1% TFA in 95% acetonitrile. The fractions are collected at every 0.5 min. Aliquots of each fraction are analyzed by both MS and analytical RP-HPLC. The fractions that contain a single u.v. 220 nm absorbance peak with expected mass unit for the cyclized peptide ([M+H]~: 1066.2) are combined and lyophilized. The final purity (95%) of the peptide is determined by an analytical RP-HPLC of the combined fractions.<br>
