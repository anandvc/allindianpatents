1.FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method of making substituted peptides or salt thereof with antidepressant activity. This application is divided out of Indian Patent Application No.198/CAL/2 001 ANTEDATED AS OF 01.05.1996.<br>
Heterogenous unipolar and bipolar depression is a common psychiatric disorder most likely mediated by neurochemical changes in the central nervous system. Administration of antidepressant drugs for treatment of unipolar depression has gained wide acceptance in the medical community over the past several decades. The present invention discloses novel peptides and their use as therapeutic agents in treating patients suffering from depression.<br>
2.  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Endogenous depression is thought to be a genetically determined biochemical disorder which results in an Inability to deal with stress. This form of depression is oftentimes classified as unipolar depression, which is subclassified into retarded depression and agitated depression. Retarded depression is characterized by psychomotor retardation, where the subject does not Interact with the surrounding environment to any extent. Agitated depression is, on the other hand, characterized by increased unproductive activity such as pacing, hand wringing, etc<br>
Unipolar depression is most likely a disorder resulting from a number of heterogenous changes in the brain. One school of thought subscribes to the catecholamine theory:<br><br>
1B<br>
that endogenous depression is caused by a reduction in norepinephrine concentration within the vicinity of adrenergic receptor sites in the brain. Another possibility is that endogenous depression is caused by an absolute or relative deficiency in indoleamine, specifically 5-hydroxytryptamine, at receptor sites in the brain.<br><br>
-2-<br>
The course of treatment for endogenous depression is electroconvulsive therapy or drug therapy.   The drugs administered for therapeutic treatment of depression include (1) tricyclic antidepressants, (2) monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, and (3) second-generation antidepressants.<br>
Tricyclic drugs have been the drug of first choice in treating endogenous depression for over three decades.   However, these drugs have limited efficacy in that two-thirds of patients receiving tricyclic drugs do not respond favorably.   The side effects of the tricyclics are numerous, including cholinergic blockage, cardiac complications, allergic reactions, dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision and tachycardia.   The tricyclic drugs are characterized structurally by a three-ringed nucleus.   The tricyclic antidepressants include imipramine, desipramine, amitriptyline, nortriptyline, protriptyline, doxepin and trimipramine.  These tricyclic structures are metabolized through the mixed-function oxidase system.   These metabolites are the pharmacologically active compounds.<br>
The MAO inhibitors have been available for treatment of depression since the 1950's.   These compounds are classified either as hydrazides, exemplified by a C-N-N moiety (e.g., phenelzine and isocarboxazid) or a nonhydrazide (e.g., tranylcypromine). These drugs have not gained wide acceptance due to serious side effects.<br>
The so called second-generation drugs are a group of new drugs which include amoxapine, maprotiline, fluoxetine, trazodone and bupropion.   Most of these drugs seem to act in the same fashion as the tricyclic drugs,<br>
Antidepressant drugs must cross the blood-brain barrier in pharmacologically effective concentrations.  The capillaries of the central nervous system, unlike capillary beds feeding other organs, possess tight junctions with cerebral endothelial cells. Therefore, the human blood-brain barrier is a lipid barrier without pores.   Any potential antidepressant drug must be designed such that the compound is able to traverse the blood-brain barrier.   Compounds with low lipid solubility as well as many ionized compounds are unable to exit the circulation for entry into the extracellular fluid of the brain.   Water soluble compounds will traverse the blood-brain barrier only if a specific membrane transport system exists.   In contrast, lipid soluble drugs, in effect, are not hampered by the blood-brain barrier.<br><br>
-3-<br>
The tripeptide MIF, otherwise known as melanocyte stimulating inhibitor,' factor, which is represented by the chemical formula of proiyl-leucyi-glycinamide or Pro-Leu-Gly-NH2, has been shown to produce numerous non-endocrine effects on the brain.   The MIF tripeptide has also been shown to be active in a number of animal models for depression.<br>
MIF was initially isolated and characterized from bovine hypothalmic extracts (Nair, etal., 1971, Biochem. Biohys. Res. Comm. 43(6): 1376-1381) and rat hypothalmic extracts (Celis, etal., 1971, Proc. Nati. Acad. Sci. USA 68(7): 1428-1433). MIF activity was attributed to inhibiting release of melanocyte stimulating hormone, a pituitary hormone known to stimulate melanin production.   Neither disclosure suggests or discloses any potential antidepressant activity for MIF.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 3,708,593 (issued to N.P. Plotnikoff on January 2, 1973) teaches that MIF exhibits antidepressant activity in mice, as shown by a modified Dopa test (Everett, et al., 1966, Proc. 1" Int. Sym. Anti-depressant Drugs, p. 164).<br>
U.S. Patent No. 3,795,738 (issued to N. P. Plotnikoff on March 5, 1974) teaches that MIF, alone or in combination with other known drugs, exhibits increased activity . against Parkinson's disease.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 3,931,184 (issued to C. G. Lex on January 6, 1976) teaches isolation of medicinally pure MIF.   A MIF hemihydrate is dissolved in methanol, followed by the addition of diethyl ether, resulting in a white crystalline precipitate of MIF.   This pure MIF is collected, washed with ether and dried under vacuum prior to use.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,278,595 (issued to J. H. Cort on July 14, 1981) teaches that practical use of MIF has been hindered because MIF is rapidly metabolized subsequent to administration.   Due to this relatively short half-life of MIF, it has been necessary to administer large quantities of MIF intravenously over prolonged periods to obtain efficacious concentrations.   Cort teaches a MIF analog characterized by replacement of Leu with its D-isomer, optionally replacing Pro with pGlu, and optionally alkyiating the terminal amide group of Gly-NH2 to produce a MIF analog.   Such an analog may possess similar antidepressant activity as MIF and enhanced stability.   Cort teaches a tripeptide having the formula X-D-Ixu-NH2CH2CONR1R2, where X is Pro or pGlu and each of R1 and R2 independently is H or a lower alkyl, especially methyl or ethyl.<br><br>

Tyr-MIF-1 (Tyr-Pro-Leu-Gly-NH3) is a brain derived peptide shown to affect passive avoidance in rats (Hayashi, et al., 1983, Brain Res. Bull. 11: 659-662).   Various analogs to Tyr-MIF-1 (i.e., substitutions for the Tyr residue, resulting in Ala-MIF-1, Leu-MIF-1 or Phe-MIF-1) were tested for a possible affect on behavioral and motor activities (Hayashi, et al., 1984, Pharmacology Biochemistry &amp; Behavior 21; 809-812). Ala-MIF-1 and Phe-MIF-1, but not Leu-MIF-1, affected passive avoidance behavior in rats.   None of these peptides were shown to affect motor behavior.<br>
Kastin, et al. (1984, Pharmacology Biochemistry &amp; Behavior 21: 767-771) discloses that MIF-1 and Tyr-MIF-1 are active as antidepressants.   The degree of activity was measured by the water wheel test, a modification of the Porsolt swim test.<br>
Kastin, et al. (1985, Pharmacology Biochemistry &amp; Behavior 23: 1045-1049) determined that Tyr-MIF-1 and several Tyr-MIF-1 analogs possess antiopiate activity. Along with Tyr-MIF-1, Phe-MIF-1 was active in inhibiting the analgesic effect of morphine in rats.<br>
Banks, et al. (1986, Am. J. Physiol. 251 [Endocrine Metabolism 14]: E477-E482) identifies the carrier-mediated transport system responsible for delivery of Tyr-MIF-1 to the extracellular brain fluid from the circulatory system.<br>
It would be extremely useful to design and generate modified small peptides for treating patients suffenng from depression which possess pharmacological activity subsequent to crossing the blood-brain barrier without inducing the side effects inherent in many of approved antidepressant drugs available today.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention discloses modified small peptides for use as antidepressant compounds.  According to the invention, these novel peptides are utilized to treat patients suffering from depression.  These modifications target amino terminus residues, carboxyl terminus residues and internal residues, including addition and substitution of amino acid residues and modification of the peptide bonds and functional side groups of respective amino acid residues as more fully described hereinbelow.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide peptides which have pharmacologic activity.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide peptides useful in treating patients exhibiting symptoms from depression.<br>
It is a feature of the invention to synthesize and provide small peptides representing novel modifications, substitutions, additions and/or deletions to a MIF core structure which have anti-depressant activity.<br>

The present invention funher discloses admixtures of the peptides of formula (1) through formula (11) with known antidepressant compounds such as amitriptyline, fluoxetine (Prozac) and sertraline (Zoloft).   It is within the ordinary skill of the artisan to generate various admixtures with the small peptides of the present invention beyond the exemplifications disclosed throughout this specification.<br>
The small peptides with which this invention is concerned are readily prepared by conventional procedures (i.e., carbodiimide method, mixed anhydride method, N, N-carbonyldiimidazole method) for the step-wise synthesis of polypeptides, and also including solid phase peptide synthesis.  The substituents groups are also readily added to the polypeptide residues by conventional procedures.<br>
The small peptides of the invention possess antidepressant activity as determined by the Porsolt swim test as described in the Example Section.   The Porsolt swim test is based on the observation that when a rat is forced to swim in a situation from which there is no escape, the rat ceases to move altogether and makes only those movements necessary to keep its head above water.   Immobility indicates a state of despair. Therefore, a compound with activity as an antidepressant will delay the onset of immobility.<br>
The active ingredient, which may comprise one or more of the peptides disclosed in the present invention, should be formulated in a suitable pharmaceutical carrier for in vivo administration to the patient by any standard method known in the art.   Appropriate routes of administration include, but are not limited to, oral (mouth or peroral administration), sublingual, parenteral (e.g., intravenous, intraspinal, intrathecal, intraventricular, epidermal, intracisternal, intracutaneous or intradermal, subcutaneous, or intramuscular), epicutaneous or transdermal, intranasal or rectal as well as inhalation (poly or mircodispersed aerosol).<br>
As with other pharmaceutical delivery strategies, the primary dosage form depends on the mode of administration.   Oral administration includes, but is not limited to tablets, capsules, solutions, suspensions, gels, powders, elixirs or syrups.   Sublingual administration includes but is not limited to tablets or lozenges.   Parenteral administration includes but is not limited to solutions and suspensions.   Epicutaneous or transdermal application will include, but are not necessarily limited to, ointments, creams, pastes, plasters, powders, aerosols, lotions, transdermal patches, discs and solutions.   Intranasal<br><br>
-22-<br>
administration of the peptide or peptides of the present invention include, but are not limited to, solutions, sprays, inhalants or ointments.   Rectal administration may include, but is not necessarily limited to, solutions, ointments or suppositories.   The active ingredient may also be formulated for incorporation into liposomes, microcapsules, polymer or wax-based and controlled release preparations.   For additional guidance regarding routes of administration and the generation of pharmaceutically effective dose rates, see Chapter 3 -"Dosage Form Design: Biopharmaceutical Considerations" in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, 1990, Ansel, H.C. and Popovich, N.G., Fifth Ed.; Lea and Febiger, Philadelphia.<br>
The concentration of the peptide(s) used in any of the aforementioned formulations will depend upon the effective dose and the mode of administration used to elicit the appropriate biological effect.   The dose should be sufficient to achieve circulating plasma concentrations of the active ingredient such that effective amounts cross the blood-brain barrier that are efficacious.   For example, when the tetrapeptide Pro-Leu-GIy-Trp-NH2 is the active ingredient, a circulating plasma level from about 30 mg to about 90 mg per average adult may be used; preferably about 60 mg per average adult.   Effective doses for various routes of administration may be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in viiro or animal model test systems.<br>
The invention will be further clarified by a consideration of the following examples, which are intended to be purely exemplary of the synthesis and use of the small peptides of the invention.<br>

6.1.   MATERIALS AND METHODS<br>
6.1.1.   PEPTIDE SYNTHESIS<br>
Small peptides of the present invention were synthesized by methods known to one of ordinary skill in the art.   Briefly, 5mM of Rink amide resin is placed in a reaction vessel of an Applied Biosystem 431A peptide synthesizer.   Double couple cycles were used since the amount of starting resin was twice that of a standard run.   The following steps were then carried out: (1) the Fmoc blocking group on the resin was first removed by washing with 20% piperidinc; (2) the resin is then washed with N-methyl-pyrrolidinone; (3) 2 mM Fmoc-proline was added to the reaction vessel together with<br><br>
-23-<br>
0,45mM 2-(LH-benzotria2o[-I-yi)-l,I,3,3,-tetramethyiuroniurn hexafiuorophosphate in a solution of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole and imM of diisopropylef-hylamlne; (4) the resin was washed with N-methylpyrrolidinone; (5) the cycle was repeated with Fmoc-Ieucine, then with Fmoc-glycine and finally with Fmoc-tryptophan; (6) the peptide resin bond was cleaved with the following solution: 0.25 ml ethanedithiol, 0.25 ml H2O, and 9.5 ml TFA, with a cleavage time of 3-4 hours; (7) the peptide was then purified by two reverse phase HPLC procedures, the first in 0.1 % TFA in water as the eluting solvent and the second using 0.1% TFA in acetonitrile as the eluting solvent.<br>
The purity of synthesized peptides was analyzed using a HP1090L analytical HPLC equipped with a diode ray.   A UV trace showing absorption of the peptide from 220 nm to 310 nm was plotted.   Molecular weights were verified by mass spectrometry.<br>

6.1.2. SYNTHESIS OF PRQ-ARG-GLY-NH,<br>
Pro-Arg-Gly-NH3 was synthesized manually using a fritted funnel with the step sequence given as for synthesis of Pro-Leu-Gly-Trp-NH2 (SEQ ID NO:5) and the appropriate Fmoc-amino acids.   Regarding synthesis of Pro-Arg-Gly-NH2, dimethylformamide was used in place of N-methylpyrrolidinone, and in step (6) the peptide resin bond was cleaved using the following solvent mixture: 0.75 g phenol in 0.25 ml thioanisole, 0.5 mi H20 and 10 ml TFA.<br>
The other peptides disclosed in this specification, except the tripeptide Pro-Arg-Gly-NH2, were prepared as described in Section 6.1.2.<br>
One of ordinary skill in the art could utilize any of a number of known techniques for synthesizing the peptides of the present invention.<br>
Each purified peptide was stored frozen as a white crystalline powder. MIF was also synthesized by techniques known to one of ordinary skill in the art. This tripeptide was stored frozen as a white crystalline powder.<br>
6.1.3. VARIATION OF THE PORSOLT SWIM TEST TO IDENTIFY PEPTIDES WITH ANTIDEPRESSANTrLACTIVITY<br><br>
-24-<br>
Male Sprague Dawley rats were obtained from Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA.   The rats were housed individually in stainless steel one half inch wire mesh cages sized in accordance with the "Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals" of the Institute of Laboratory Animals Resources National Research and Counsel.   The animal rooms were kept under a twelve hour light/twelve hour dark cycle, with temperature maintained at 18° to 26°C and relative humidity at 40% to 70%.   The test animals were acclimated for a minimum of seven days prior to initiation of the study. Daily doses of the small peptides of the present invention were prepared by dissolving 1 mg q.s. to 10.0 ml 0.01M acetic acid in 0.9% saline.   1 ml/kg of the respective peptide wasNthen administered by jntraperitoneal injection once a day for five consecutive days.<br>
The antidepressant activity of the peptides of the present invention was determined by a variation of the Porsolt swim test (Porsolt, et al., 1977, Nature 266: 730-732).   The method is based on the observation that a rat, when forced to swim in a situation from which there is no escape, will, after an initial period of vigorous activity, eventually cease to move altogether and make only those movements necessary to keep its head above water.   Immobility indicates a state of despair in which the conditioned rat cannot escape and resigns itself to the experimental situation.   On the first day of the study, the animals were plunged individually into a vertical plexiglass cylinder (40 cm in height and 18 cm in diameter) containing 24 cm of water maintained at 25-26° C.   The cylinder was painted white.   The water was changed between each rat.   After 15 minutes in the cylinder the rats were removed and returned to their individual cages without being dried. One hour later the rats were administered the tetrapeptide, MIF or a control (.01M acetic acid in 0.9% saline), based on individual bodytweight.   On days 2, 3, and 4, at the time of day that corresponds to the average injection time of the entire study group of animals, the rats were injected with either peptide 1-39 or the control solution.   On day 5, after being weighed each individual rat was respectively dosed based on individual body weight.   Doses were staggered in such a manner as to provide ample time for test evaluation to be conducted between animals.   Fifteen minutes following injection, each rat was placed in the water for 300 seconds.   The mobile time for each rat was recorded.<br><br>

Compounds #1-15 listed above also correspond to the graphical data presented in Figure 2 and Figure 3.<br>
Compound designations are for reference purposes only.   The numerical designations utilized in Table 1 do not correspond to data entries as Compound #1-15 in Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 3.  The data Reported in Figures 1-3 correspond to tests using the standard 0.1 mg/ml dosage.   Data presented in Table 1 lists this data as well as numerous additional tests with other peptides of the present invention, various . combinations of compounds and at varying dosages.<br>
A responding animal is defined as an animal whose mobile time during the 300 second exposure to the water tank was of longer duration than the average mobile time of the CGI group plus one standard deviation.   For example, if the average mobile time for CGI group of twelve treated rats is 35 seconds plus or minus one standard deviation of 15 seconds, then a responding animal is defined as an animal exhibiting a mobile time greater than fifty seconds.   Therefore, the control group mean plus one standard deviation was talcen as a threshold for response; the number of rats with mobile times exceeding this level is tabulated as a responding animal.<br>
Table 1 (column 5) gives the difference between the mobile times of the various compounds, combination of compounds and dosages tested and the mobile time of CGI. The average of mean mobile time for each peptide are presented.   The average mean mobile time between experimental groups for each compound listed above as Compound #1 - 15, represented by a double asterisk, is also presented as pan of Figure 2.    Figure 2 illustrates the mean of mobile time for peptides identified above as<br><br>
-27-<br>
compounds #1-15.  The treatment means were compared with control (CGI) means by a one-tailed Student's t-test.   The probabilities so obtained are given in Table 1 (column 8) for the all compounds tested.<br>
The Z-score of for mean of mobile time for Compound #1 -15, again as listed above, is reported in Figure 3 and Table 1 (at column 10).  The Z-score is a dimensionless measure of efficacy that was averaged over the numerous studies.   The mean of Z-score is defined as the difference between the treatment group's mean mobile time and the control group's mean mobile time, divided by the standard deviation of the mean mobile time of the control group.   Therefore, an inefficacious compound will generate a Z-score near zero, and higher Z-scores denote increasing efficacy.<br>
Data presented in Table 1 and the graphic representation of data listed above as compounds #1-15 in Figures 1-3 indicate that numerous peptides of the present invention exhibit antidepressant-activity in comparison to known antidepressant'compounds such as amitriptyline, Prozac and Zoloft.   Additionally, the vast majority of the exemplified peptides of the present invention show greater activity than MIF.   The present data also indicates that a synergistic effect may exist between peptides of the present invention and known antidepressant compounds, such as Prozac.   For example, data presented in Table 1 at No. I indicate that an admixture of 4-F-Phe-4-OH-Pro-Arg-GIy-Trp-NH2 (SEQ ID NO:43) at 0.1 mg/ml and prozac at 0.8 mg/ml results in 12 of 12 responders. Additionally, data presented in Table 1 at No. 6 indicate that an admixture of 4-F-Phe-4-OH-Pro-Arg-Gly-Trp-NH2 (SEQ ID NO:43) at 0.1 mg/ml and amitriptyline results in 10 of 12 responders.<br>
Therefore, Applicants disclose a number of small peptides for use as antidepressant compounds, with biological data to support such use.<br>
