 A WRINKLE REDUCING POWDERED OR TABLET DETERGENT COMPOSITION<br>
(2) HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165-166 Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai 400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to laundry product compositions for reducing fabric wrinkling.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
When textiles, such as clothing, linens and the like, are laundered, it is typically desired that wrinkles be â–  eliminated or minimized after the cleaning and drying process. Mechanical wrinkle reduction techniques, such as heat and pressure (for example, ironing) , have been used but can be time consuming and inconvenient.<br>
Known attempts to reduce wrinkles by means of chemical ingredients in the wash include the use of zwitterionic surfactants, aminosilicones, curable aminosilicones, cellulase enzymes and alkyl amides.  However, each of these ingredients have one or more drawbacks.  For example, zwitterionic surfactants are believed to work best in cold water. Aminosilicones can cause yellowing and can be difficult to formulate.  Curable aminosilicones require the heat of an iron to reduce wrinkles.  Cellulase enzymes generally require several wash cycles before anti-wrinkle benefits become noticeable.  Alkyl amides are not very-effective relative to other wrinkle reducing agents.-<br>
Therefore, there is a need for an effective and efficient means for eliminating or reducing wrinkles in textiles.  To<br><br>
be effective and efficient, the ingredient should preferably work across a- broad range of water temperatures, not require the use of an iron, have little to no discoloration effect on the laundered item and/or provide a noticeable wrinkle reducing benefit after relatively few wash cycles.<br>

Statement of Invention<br>
The present application relates to the inclusion of one or more wrinkle reducing ingredients in a powdered or tablet detergent composition.<br>
Thus, a first aspect of the present invention provides a powdered or tablet detergent composition comprising a wrinkle reducing agent selected from one or more of sulphated vegetable oils and sulphonated vegetable oils; said laundry detergent composition comprising from 15 to 60 wt% of surfactant.<br>
According to a preferred aspect there is provided a detergent composition comprising a wrinkle reducing<br><br><br>
agent  selected form one or more of polyalkyleneoxide modified polydimethylsiloxanes; linear aminopolydimethyl-siloxane polalkyleneoxide copolymers; sulphated vegetable oils; sulphonated vegetable oils; high molecular weight polyacrylamides; betaine siloxane copolymers; and alkylactam siloxane copolymers.<br>
A second aspect of the present invention provides a detergent composition comprising a wrinkle reducing agent comprising one or more compounds that do not have a net positive charge.<br>
The benefits are delivered to the laundered item during the cleaning step and, therefore, reduces the need for further wrinkle reducing steps when the items are taken from the dryer or after hang drying.<br><br><br>
A third aspect, of the present invention provides a method of reducing the occurrence of wrinkles in laundered clothing comprising:<br>
providing a detergent formulation according to the first or second aspect of the invention;<br>
contacting the detergent formulation with clothing during a washing procedure;<br>
and allowing the clothing to dry.	 <br>
The laundered clothing has fewer wrinkles present than the same clothing if laundered and dried in the same or similar manner with a detergent formulation which is identical, except that it does not include" the wrinkle-reducing agent.<br>
The product can be provided in any suitable form for     example, as a powder liquid or tablet.  Delivery can be   <br>
achieved by direct dosing, ...drawer	dispensing.,,.or by othgr <br>
known dosing means.  Tablets can also be dosed in mesh bags<br>
The ingredients that facilitate the benefit of wrinkle reduction are believed to lubricate fiber surfaces.  By lubricating the fiber surfaces of garments, for -example, the fibers slide more easily relative to each other and are less likely to entangle, resulting in less wrinkles.  The preferred fiber lubricants disclosed herein have been  shown to noticeably reduce the number of wrinkles.  The preferred<br><br><br>
embodiments also overcame one or more of the above noted disadvantages of prior wrinkle reducing agents or methods.<br>
While it is knowr that lubricants can be waed to reduca wrinkles in textiles, it was surprisingly found that these materials work from a main wash detergent.  More particularly, main wash detergents are highly diluted and are subject to one or more rinse cycles.  Such high dilution and rinsing would be expected to diminish or eliminate the desired wrinkle reduction effect of the lubricant.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Several molecules have been identified for wrinkle reduction benefits when included in known liquid detergent formulations.  Using the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists (AATCC) method# 124 (described in greater detail, below), the claimed molecular classes were found to reduce the number of wrinkles on test cloths. A , preferred wrinkle reducing agent is a polyalkyleneoxide modified polydimethylsiloxane, for example that sold under the name Silwet L-7622 available from Witco, Greenwich, CT. Other most preferred wrinkle reducing agents are sulphated canola oil and/or castor oil available from Freedom Chemical Co., Charlotte, NC.<br>
One or more of the molecules/compounds from the above-identified classes are preferably included in known detergent formulations in an effective amount sufficing to reduce the occurrence of wrinkles as compared to clothing laundered and dried in a similar manner with a detergent<br><br><br><br>
formulation that excludes the wrinkle reducing agents.  An<br>
effective amount of the wrinkle reducing ingredient is<br>
preferably from 0.1.wt% to 10 wt%, more preferably from<br>
Q.1 wt% to 5 wt% and most preferably from 0.3 wt% to 1.5.<br>
wt%.  Suitable liquid detergent formulations are described;<br>
.for example, in U.S. Patent Nos.: 4,261,868; 4,322,308;    <br>
4,959,179; 5,089,163; 5,147,576; and 5,205,957, all of which<br>
are incorporated herein by reference.	<br>
An additional advantage of the above-identified wrinkle reducing ingredients is that the molecules/compounds do not have a net positive charge in a neutral or alkaline medium, i.e. a medium having a pH greater than or equal to about . 6.5. Lack of a net positive charge makes their inclusion in liquid detergents containing anionic surfactants much easier. More specifically, they are less likely to precipitate.with negatively charged surfactants.<br>
A further,advantage is the likelihood of "yellowing""fabrics with the above wrinkle reducing molecules is less than with amine-containinig, ingredients.  In addition, some of the above wrinkle reducing ingredients, such as sulphated vegetable oils, are relatively inexpensive.<br>
The detergent formulations of the invention may contain a surface-active compound (surfactant) which may be chosen from soap and non-soap anionic, cationic, non-ionic, amphoteric and zwitterionic surface-active compounds and mixtures thereof. Many suitable surface-active compounds are available and are fully described in the literature, for<br>
 -<br><br>
example, in "Surface-Active Agents and Detergents", Volumes I and II, by Schwartz, Perry and Berch.<br>
The preferred detergent-active compounds that can be used are soaps and synthetic non-soap anionic and non-ionic compounds.<br>
The formulations of the invention may contain linear alkylbenzene sulphonate, particularly linear alkylbenzene sulphonates having an alkyl chain length of C8-C15.  It is preferred if the level of linear alkylbenzene sulphonate "is from 0 wt% to 30 wt%, more preferably 1 wt% to 25 wt%, most preferably from 2 wt% to 15 wt%.<br>
The formulations of the invention may contain other anionic surfactants in amounts additional to the, percentages quoted above. Suitable anionic surfactants are well-known to those skilled in the art. Examples include primary and secondary alkyl sulphates, particularly C8-C15 primary alkyl sulphates; alkyl ether sulphates; olefin sulphonates; alkyl xylene sulphonates; dialkyl sulphosuccinates; and fatty acid ester sulphonates.  Sodium salts are generally preferred.<br>
The formulations of the invention may also contain non-ionic surfactant.  Nonionic surfactants that may be used include the primary and secondary alcohol ethoxylates, especially the C8-C20 aliphatic alcohols ethoxylated with an average of from 1 to 20 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol, and more especially the C10-C15 primary and secondary<br><br><br><br>
aliphatic alcohols ethoxylated with an average of from 1 to 10 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol.  Non-ethoxylated nonionic surfactants include alkylpoly-glycosides, glycerol monoethers,. and polyhydroxyamides (glucamide) .<br>
It is preferred if the level of non-ionic surfactant is from 0 wt% to 30 wt%, preferably from 1 wt% to 25 wt%, most preferably from 2 wt% to 15 wt%.<br>
The choice of surface-active compound (surfactant), and the amount present, will depend on the intended use of the detergent composition.  In fabric washing compositions, different surfactant systems may be chosen, as is well known to the skilled formulator, for handwashing products and for products intended for use in different types of washing<br>
The total amount of surfactant present will also depend on, the intended end use and may be as high as 60 wt%, for example, in a composition for washing fabrics by hand.  In compositions for machine washing of fabrics, an amount of from 5 to 40 wt% is generally appropriate.  Typically the compositions will comprise at least 2 wt% surfactant e.g. 2-60%, preferably 15-40% most preferably 5-35%.<br>
Detergent formulations suitable for use in most automatic fabric washing machines generally contain anionic non-soap surfactant, or non-ionic surfactant, or combinations of the two in any suitable ratio, optionally" together with soap.<br><br><br><br>
Conventional fabric conditioning compound may optionally be used in the formulations of the present invention.  The conditioning compounds may be cationic or non-ionic.  If the fabric conditioning compound is to be employed in a main wash detergent composition the compound will typically be non-ionic.  For rinse cycle products, it will typically be cationic.  The term fabric conditioning compound as used herein includes fabric softening compounds or.agents.<br>
The fabric conditioning compound is suitably a substantially " water insoluble quaternary ammonium material comprising a single alkyl or alkenyl long chain having an average chain length greater than or equal to C20 or, more preferably, a compound comprising a polar head group and two alkyl or alkenyl chains having an average chain length greater than<br>
Preferably the fabric conditioning compound has two long chain alkyl or alkenyl chains each having an average chain length greater than or equal to C16 Most preferably at least 50% of the long chain alkyl or alkenyl groups have a chain length of C16 or above. It is preferred if the long chain alkyl or alkenyl groups of the fabric conditioning . compounds are predominantly linear.<br>
The fabric conditioning compounds which optionally may be used in the formulations of the invention are preferably compounds that provide excellent softening and are characterised by a chain melting Lp to La transition<br><br><br><br><br>
temperature greater than 25Â°C, preferably greater than 35Â°C, most preferably greater than 45Â°C This"L to La transition can be. measured by DSC as defined in "Handbook of Lipid , Bilayers,. D Marsh, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Florida, 1990 (pages 137 and 337) .<br>
Substantially insoluble fabric conditioning compounds in the context of.this invention are defined as fabric .conditioning compounds having a solubility less than 1 x 10-3 wt% in demineralised water at 20Â°C.  Preferably the fabric softening compounds have a solubility less than 1 x 10" wt%, most preferably less than 1 x 10" to 1 x 10" .<br>
The formulations of the invention, when used as main wash fabric washing compositions, will generally also contain one or more detergency builders.  The total amount of detergency builder in the compositions will typically range from 5 to 80 wt%, preferably from 10 to 60 wt%.<br>
Inorganic builders that, may be present include sodium carbonate, if desired in combination with a crystallisation seed for calcium carbonate, as disclosed in GB 1 437 950__ (Unilever); crystalline and amorphous aluminosilicates, for example, zeolites as disclosed in GB 1 473 201 (Henkel) , amorphous aluminosilicates as disclosed in GB .1 473 202 (Henkel) and mixed crystalline/amorphous aluminosilicates as disclosed in GB 1 470 250 (Procter &amp; Gamble) ; and layered silicates as disclosed in EP 164 514B (Hoechst)    Inorganic phosphate builders, for example, sodium orthophosphate,     <br><br><br><br><br>
pyrophosphate and tripolyphosphate are also suitable for use<br>

These materials contain some bound water and are required to have a calcium ion exchange capacity of at least 50 mg CaO/g.  The preferred sodium aluminosilicates contain 1.5-3.5 Si02 units (in the formula above).  Both the amorphous and the crystalline materials can be prepared readily by reaction between sodium silicate and sodium aluminate, as amply described in the literature.  Suitable crystalline sodium aluminosilicate ion-exchange detergency builders are described, for example, in GB 1 429 143 "(Procter &amp; Gamble). The preferred sodium aluminosilicates of this type are the well-known commercially available zeolites A and X, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The zeolite may be the commercially available zeolite 4A no: widely used in laundry detergent powders.  However, according to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the zeolite builder incorporated in the compositions of the<br><br><br>
invention is maximum aluminium zeolite P (zeolite MAP) as described and claimed in EP 384-070A (Unilever).  Zeolite MAP is defined as an alkali metal alumiriosilicate of the  zeolite P type having a silicon to aluminium ratio not exceeding 1.33, preferably within the range of from 0.90 to 1.33, and more preferably within the range of from 0.90 to. 1.20.<br>

Test Method and Examples<br>
Wrinkle reduction was measured by using the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists" (AATCC) method #124, Appearance of Fabrics after Repeated Home Laundering.  In this method, four cloth types (silk, rayon, cotton, and linen) are washed, dried and stored in a well defined way.  The dried cloths are then evaluated for wrinkle content by comparison with wrinkle smoothness replicas which can be purchases from AATCC.  Factors such as the light used, the angle of the cloths and replicas to the<br><br><br><br>
light, and the background are carefully controlled and described in the method.  There are six replicas with values of 1, 2, 3, 3.5, 4, and 5 with 5 being perfectly smooth and 1 being very wrinkled.  Three trained observers are asked to give a value of 1-5, to the nearest 0.5 unit, to each cloth based on which replica it most closely resembles.  The results are totalled and averaged over the three observers for each cloth type.  According to the method, a difference of greater than 0.17 between the results for two products indicates" there is a significant difference at the 95% confidence level. A difference of greater than or equal to 0.25 indicates a significant difference at the 99% confidence level.<br><br>
Example 1<br>
The following "formulation containing a wrinkle reduction ingredient was produced:<br><br><br><br>
