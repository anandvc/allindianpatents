The Invention furthermore relates to herbicidal compositions comprising a herbicidally active amount of a herbicidal mixture as defined above and at least one inert liquid and/or solid carrier and, if desired, at least one surfactant.<br>
Moreover, the invention relates to processes for the preparation of these compositions and to a method of controlling selectively undesirable vegetation In crops.<br>
In crop protection products, It is always desirable to increase the selectivity of a herbicide or a herbicidal mixture in crops. It is an object of the present invention to increase the selectivity of the herbicidally active 3-heterocyclyl-substltuted benzoyl derivatives of the group A or herbicidal mixtures comprising them in crops while keeping the activity of an active ingredlent(s) and the reliability of action on the weeds.<br><br>
We have found that this object is achieved by the mixtures defined at the outset. We have furthermore found herbicidal compositions which comprise these mixtures, processes for their preparation, and methods of controlling undesirable vegetation in crops. In the last-mentioned cases, it is irrelevant whether the herbicidally active compounds of the components A), B) and, if desired, C) are formulated and applied jointly or separately and in which sequence they are applied in the case of separate application.<br>

The present invention also extends to herbicidal compositions which comprise a herbicidally active amount of a herbicidal mixture (comprising components A), B) and, if desired, C) as described above), at least one inert liquid and/or solid carrier and, if desired, at least one surfactant.<br>
The herbicidal compositions according to the invention can effect very good control of broad-leaved weeds and grass weeds in crops such as maize, cereals, rice and soya without damaging the crop plants, an effect observed especially even at low rates of application.<br>
Especially the mixtures which comprise as active ingredients one 3-hetero-cyclyl-substituted benzoyl derivative (component A), and one safener (component B ) can effect very good control of broad-leaved weeds and grass weeds in crops such as cereals, rice and soya, especially cereals, without damaging the crop plants.<br><br>

Taking into consideration the variety of application method in question, the herbicidal compositions according to the invention can additionally be employed in a further number of crop plants for eliminating undesirable plants. Examples of suitable crops are the following:<br>
Allium cepa, Ananas comosus, Arachis hypogaea. Asparagus officinalis. Beta vulgaris ssp. altissima. Beta vulgaris ssp. rapa, Brassica napus var. napus, Brassica napus var. napobrassica, Brassica rapa var. silvestris. Camellia sinensis, Carthamus tinctorius, Carya illinoinensis. Citrus limon.

Moreover, the herbicidal compositions and synergistic herbicidal mixtures according to the invention may also be employed for controlling harmful plants in modified crops. These modified crops are obtained by genetic engineering methods or by breeding, and - as a rule - they are distinguished by particular, advantageous properties, for example by resistance to certain crop protection agents (inter alia imidazolinone tolerant crops, for example imidazolinone tolerant corn), resistance to plant diseases or pathogens causing plant diseases such as particular insects or microorganism such as fungi, bacteria or viruses. Other particular properties relate, for example, to the harvested material in terms of quality, storing properties, composition and specific constitutions.<br>
The mixtures according to the invention, or the herbicidal compositions comprising them, can be employed, for example, in the form of directly sprayable aqueous<br><br>
solutions, powders, suspensions, also highly-concentrated aqueous, oily or other suspensions or dispersions, emulsions, oil dispersions, pastes, dusts, materials for spreading or granules, by means of spraying, atomizing, dusting, spreading or pouring.<br>
The use forms depend on the intended purposes; in any case, they should guarantee the finest possible distribution of the active ingredients according to the invention.<br>
Suitable inert auxiliaries are mineral oil fractions of medium to high boiling point such as kerosene and diesel oil, furthermore coal tar oils and oils of vegetable or animal origin, aliphatic, cyclic and aromatic hydrocarbons, e.g. paraffins, tetrahydronaph-thalene, alkylated naphthalenes and their derivatives, alkylated benzenes and their derivatives, alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol and cyclohexanol, ketones such as cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents, such as N-methylpyrrolidone and water.<br>
Aqueous use forms can be prepared from emulsion concentrates, suspensions, pastes, wettable powders or water-dispersible granules by adding water. To prepare emulsions, pastes or oil dispersions, the substances, as such or dissolved in an oil or solvent, can be homogenized in water by means of wetting agent, tackifier, dispersant or emulsifier. However, it is also possible to prepare concentrates composed of active substance, wetting agent, tackifier, dispersant or emulsifier and, if appropriate, solvent or oil, and these concentrates are suitable for dilution with water.<br>
Suitable surfactants are the alkali metal, alkaline earth metal and ammonium salts of aromatic sulfonic acids, e.g. ligno-, phenol-, naphthalene- and dibutylnaphthalene-sulfonic acid, and of fatty acids, of alkyl- and alkylaryl sulfonates, of alkyl sulfates, lauryl ether sulfates and fatty alcohol sulfates, and salts of sulfated hexa-, hepta- and octa-decanols, and of fatty alcohol glycol ether, condensates of sulfonated naphthalene and its derivatives with formaldehyde, condensates of naphthalene, or of the naphthalene-sulfonic acids, with phenol and formaldehyde, polyoxyethylene octylphenyl ether, ethoxylated isooctyl-, octyl- or nonylphenol, alkylphenyl and tributylphenyl polyglycol ether, alkylaryl polyether alcohols, isotridecyl alcohol, fatty alcohol/ethylene oxide condensates, ethoxylated castor oil, polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers or polyoxypropylene alkyl ethers, lauryl alcohol polyglycol ether acetate, sorbitol esters, lignin-sulfite waste liquors or methylcellulose.<br>
Powders, materials for spreading and dusts can be prepared by mixing or concomi¬tantly grinding the synergistic herbicidal mixture or the individual active ingredients with a solid carrier.<br><br>
Granules, e.g. coated granules, impregnated granules and homogeneous granules, can be prepared by binding the active ingredients to solid carriers. Solid carriers are mineral earths such as silicas, silica gels, silicates, talc, kaolin, limestone, lime, chalk, bole, loess, clay, dolomite, diatomaceous earth, calcium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, magnesium oxide, ground synthetic material, fertilizers such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium phosphate, ammonium nitrate, ureas and products of vegetable origin such as cereal meal, tree bark meal, wood meal and nutshell meal, cellulose powders or other solid carriers.<br>
The concentrations of the mixtures according to the invention in the ready-to-use products can be varied within wide ranges. In general, the formulations comprise from 0.01 to 95% by weight, preferably 0.5 to 90% by weight, of the mixture according to the invention.<br>
The components A) and B) and, if desired, C) can be formulated jointly, but also separately, and/or applied to the plants, their environment and/or seeds jointly or separately. It is preferable to apply the active ingredients simultaneously. However, it is also possible to apply them separately.<br>
The compound of group B) can also be used for penetrating the seed of the crop plant (seed dressing), or to be incorporated into the seed furrows prior to sowing. The other compounds of groups A), and, if desired, C) are applied then separately from the compound of group B).<br>
I     It is preferably to apply the active ingredients simultaneously. However, it is possible to apply them separately.<br>
Moreover, it may be advantageous to apply the herbicidal compositions according to the invention, jointly or separately, with additional other crop protection agents, for example with pesticides or agents for controlling phytopathogenic fungi or bacteria. Also of interest is the miscibility with mineral salt solutions which are employed for treating nutritional and trace element deficiencies. Non-phytotoxic oils and oil concentrates can also be added.<br>
The mixtures according to the invention and the herbicidal compositions can be applied pre- or post-emergence. If the active ingredients are less well tolerated by certain crop plants, application techniques may be used in which the herbicidal compositions are sprayed, with the aid of the spray apparatus, in such a way that they come into as little contact, if any, with the leaves of the sensitive crop plants while reaching the leaves of undesirable plants which grow underneath, or the bare soil (post-directed, lay-by).<br><br>
In the case of a post-emergence treatment of the plants, the herbicldal compositions according to the invention are preferably applied by foliar application. Application may be effected, for example, by usual spraying techniques with water as the carrier, using amounts of spray mixture of approx. 100 to 1000 I/ha. The compositions may also be applied by the so-called "low-volume" and "ultra-low-volume" methods, or in the form of so-called granules.<br>
As a rule, the synergistic herbicldal mixtures comprise components A), B) and, if desired, C) in such weight ratios that the safening effect takes place.<br>
The ratios of components A) and B) in the mixture preferably range from 1:0.002 to 1:800, preferably from 1:0.003 to 1:160, particularly preferably from 1:0.02 to 1:160.<br>
The ratios of component A) and C) in the mixture preferably range from 1:0.001 to 1:500, preferably from 1:0.01 to 1:100, particularly preferably from 1:0.1 to 1:50.<br>
The rate of application of pure herbicldal mixture, i.e. without formulation auxiliaries, amounts to 0.2 to 5000 g/ha, preferably 2 to 2000 g/ha, in particular 8 to 1500 g/ha, of active substance (a.s.), depending on the intended aim, the season, the target plants and growth stage.<br>
The rate of application of the 3-heterocyclyl-substituted benzoyl derivative (component A) is from 0.1 to 250 g/ha, as a rule from 5 to 200 g/ha, preferably from 10 to 150 g/ha, of active substance (a.s.).<br>
The preferred rate of application of component B) is from 0.1 to 500 g/ha, as a rule 0.5 to 250 g/ha, preferably 1 to 100 g/ha, of active substance (a.s.).<br>
The preferred rate of application of the optional component C) is 0.1 to 500 g/ha, as a rule 0.5 to 250 g/ha, preferably 1 to 200 g/ha, of active substance (a.s.).<br>
As a rule the application rate of the active ingredients of the optional component C) are as follows:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Use examples<br>
The mixtures according to the invention were applied pre- or post-emergence (foliar treatment). The herbicidal compounds of component B) and of component C) were applied in the formulation in which they are present as commercially available product.<br>
The herbicidally active compounds of components A), B) and, if desired, C) were applied in succession or jointly, in the latter case in some cases as a tank mix and in some cases as a readymix, in the form of emulsions, aqueous solutions or suspensions, the vehicle being water (300 - 400 I/ha). In the case of the field trials, application was effected with the aid of a mobile plot sprayer.<br>
The test period extended over 3 to 8 weeks, and the stands were also observed at later points in time.<br>
Damage by the herbicidal compositions was evaluated with reference to a scale of 0% to 100% in comparison with untreated control plots. 0 means no damage and 100 means complete destruction of the plants.<br>
The following examples will demonstrate the action of the herbicidal compositions which can be used according to the invention, without excluding the possibility of other uses.<br>
The herbicidal mixtures according to the invention exert a lower injury than the individual components when used alone.<br>
For example, the post-emergence application of 50 g/ha 4-[2-methyl-3-(4,5-dihydro-isoxazol-3-yl)-4-methylsulfonyl-benzoyl]-1-methyl-5-hydroxy-1H-pyrazole controls unwanted plants like wild oat, green foxtail and pigweed in an excellent manner but causes damages in spring wheat as well as in durum wheat.<br>
However, the postemergence application of 50 g/ha 4-[2-methyl-3-(4,5-dihydroisoxazol-3-yl)-4-methylsulfonyl-benzoyl]-1-methyl-5-hydroxy-1H-pyrazole and of 30 g/ha cloquintocet mexyl reduces the damages in the crop plants convincingly without reducing the control of the unwanted plants.<br>
Similar results are achieved in spring barley at application rates of 25 g/ha 4-[2-methyl-3-(4,5-dihydroisoxazol-3-yl)-4-methylsulfonyl-benzoyl]-1-methyl-5-hydroxy-1H-pyrazole 30 g/ha cloquintocet mexyl under post emergence conditions.<br><br><br>
