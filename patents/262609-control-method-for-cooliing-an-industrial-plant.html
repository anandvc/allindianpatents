Description<br>
Control method for cooling an industrial plant<br>
The invention relates to a method for controlling the cooling<br>
of an industrial plant comprising at least one electrical<br>
component and with a cooling system comprising at least one<br>
cooling element for cooling the electrical component, wherein<br>
at least one sensor measures the temperature and/or viscosity<br>
of the coolant in the cooling system.<br>
Cooling of an electrical component, particularly of an oil<br>
transformer, is necessary due to the heat energy produced in<br>
the operation of the electrical component. In the case of an<br>
oil-cooled transformer, a cooling circuit system extending<br>
between the windings is conventionally used in which a coolant<br>
such as, e.g. a cooling air, circulates. Due to the heating of<br>
the cooling oil, heat layers are produced within the cooling<br>
circuits so that the cooling oil circulates within the cooling<br>
system.<br>
At the same time, the cooling system is frequently connected to<br>
a heat exchanger which delivers the heat of the cooling oil as<br>
coolant to the environmental air. This heat exchange is<br>
frequently supported by additional radiators in that the volume<br>
of air which is in contact with the heat exchanger is<br>
increased. Effective cooling of an oil transformer can be<br>
provided by the coordinated control of additional oil pumps<br>
within the coolant and of the radiator performance.<br>
This cooling system consisting of the cooling circuit for the<br>
oil, the heat exchanger and the radiators is conventionally<br>
controlled in a very simple manner. When a particular<br>
temperature level is<br><br>
exceeded within the cooling system, the oil pumps and/or the<br>
fans are switched in, the fans and/or the pumps only have a<br>
maximum of three power levels. These units are switched in when<br>
particular predetermined values are exceeded. The<br>
disadvantageous factor in this arrangement is, however, that<br>
these cooling units are switched in or out, respectively, only<br>
within large temperature intervals. However, this leads to<br>
considerable changes in volume of the oil level within the<br>
cooling system and the expansion vessels connected thereto. In<br>
the case of large fluctuations of the volume within the<br>
expansion vessel, so-called "breathing" of the transformer is<br>
produced as a result of which humidity increasingly enters into<br>
the coolant due to the contact with the environmental air. This<br>
leads to accelerated ageing of the coolant liquid and<br>
additionally impairs the insulating property of the cooling oil<br>
as coolant.<br>
The temperature within the cooling system or the temperature<br>
existing in the transformer, respectively, is conventionally<br>
measured or determined indirectly. In this context, a<br>
temperature jump between the winding and the surrounding<br>
cooling system, which depends on the current within the<br>
winding, must be taken into consideration, on the one hand.<br>
This is why the transformer secondary current is used for<br>
determining the winding temperature. The transformer secondary<br>
current, in turn, feeds a heating resistor in a pointer<br>
thermometer and, as a result, produces a temperature indication<br>
corresponding to the transformer loading which, in the ideal<br>
case, corresponds to the oil temperature actually measured. On<br>
the basis of this indirect measuring method, the average or,<br>
respectively, maximum winding temperature can be mapped. In<br>
this arrangement, however, the half-current adjustments are<br>
made according to previously determined characteristics.<br>
Furthermore, the temperature jump between the winding and the<br>
surrounding coolant is calculated on the basis of the<br><br>
so-called rated transformer operating state. At other operating<br>
states of the transformer than the rated operating state, an<br>
unequivocal determination of the hot spot temperature is not<br>
possible since, on the one hand, the physical design model<br>
forming the basis for the rated operating state - and thus the<br>
calculation of the hot spot temperature - is not completely<br>
applicable to other operating states of the transformer.<br>
Furthermore, current state parameters of the cooling system,<br>
e.g. the number of pumps and fans currently in operation, are<br>
not interrogated and therefore the instantaneous cooling<br>
capacity is not taken into consideration in the determination<br>
of the current actual winding temperature.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to avoid the<br>
abovementioned disadvantages and provide optimum cooling<br>
capacity to an industrial application during its operation at<br>
any time.<br>
According to the invention, the object is achieved by the<br>
features of claim 1. In this context, it is provided that rule-<br>
based applications and/or a neuron network is used for<br>
controlling the cooling element by means of a control profile<br>
and is optimized with respect to a predetermined operating<br>
state of the electrical component.<br>
The control profile is predetermined by the operator and is<br>
optimized with respect to a predeterminable operating state of<br>
the electrical component. Thus, e.g., the control profile can<br>
be designed in such a manner that as little noise loading as<br>
possible is produced and thus the use of fans is almost<br>
dispensed with during a deviation between NOMINAL and ACTUAL<br>
temperature. The control profile can also be oriented towards a<br>
long operating time of the electrical component<br><br>
in that a certain temperature must not be exceeded within the<br>
electrical component.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment of the method, it is provided<br>
that the temperature distribution within the electrical<br>
component is calculated on the basis of the measured<br>
temperature and/or viscosity and/or flow rate of the coolant<br>
and/or operating data used as a basis in the development of the<br>
electrical component.<br>
The method according to the invention ensures that the control<br>
of the cooling elements is optimized for each individual<br>
transformer and is especially matched to the respective life of<br>
the transformer, taking into consideration the available<br>
cooling elements, the available cooling capacity, the current<br>
operating state. The control profile to be selected by the<br>
operator is used as a basis for controlling the cooling system<br>
and thus for optimally operating the transformer with regard to<br>
the selected control profile such as, e.g. controlling the<br>
transformer with regard to a maximum running time in service.<br>
In addition, data and design values of the planning and<br>
development of the transformer are taken into consideration in<br>
the generation of the respective control profile and in the<br>
calculation of the hot spot temperature. Furthermore,<br>
deviations between calculation and real operation, already<br>
found in the transformer test department, can be implemented in<br>
the specific control profiles of the transformers.<br>
As well, there are diagnostic capabilities about the state of<br>
the cooling system and the past, current and - using load<br>
models as a basis - also of the future operating state of the<br>
transformer. Processing<br><br>
these state variables of the cooling system in a database makes<br>
it possible to build up a history of the operating states. In<br>
addition, maintenance intervals can be optimally calculated and<br>
initiated by means of the actual operating state. The<br>
difference with respect to monitoring systems already on the<br>
market mainly lies in the fact that the optimization of the<br>
cooling system is focused on each specific transformer. The<br>
SIMATIC software is the essential basis for the control<br>
software.<br>
Advantageously, for calculating the temperature distribution,<br>
the environmental temperature and the current flowing through<br>
the electrical component is measured and is included in the<br>
calculation of the temperature distribution, wherein, when<br>
predetermined threshold values are exceeded, the cooling<br>
element is regulated with a correspondingly higher cooling<br>
capacity on the basis of the selected control profile.<br>
According to the invention, the cooling element is regulated by<br>
means of the selected control profile in such a manner that a<br>
uniform temperature distribution within the electrical<br>
component is ensured. As an alternative, the cooling element is<br>
regulated by means of the selected control profile in such a<br>
manner that a predetermined maximum temperature distribution<br>
within the electrical component is not exceeded.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment of the method according to the<br>
invention, at least two cooling elements can be regulated<br>
individually and in a speed-dependent manner. Furthermore, the<br>
electrical component is a transformer and the cooling element<br>
is a speed-selectable fan.<br>
The invention is also characterized by the fact that the<br>
temperature and/or viscosity measured at the sensor, the<br><br>
calculated temperature distribution and the control values for<br>
the cooling element are transferred to a control room, wherein<br>
the control room independently controls the cooling element, if<br>
required, independently of the calculated temperature<br>
distribution and the control values for the cooling element<br>
derived therefrom.<br>
Advantageously, it is provided that the control profile can be<br>
changed at any time and a new optimum operating state of the<br>
electrical component is calculated on the basis of the changed<br>
control profile. Thus, e.g., an operator can change the control<br>
profile, and thus the desired operating state of the electrical<br>
component, directly at the electrical component. With the<br>
change in control profile, the method according to the method<br>
determines the optimum cooling capacity for achieving the<br>
NOMINAL temperature on the basis of the ACTUAL temperature.<br>
The object is also achieved by the features of claim 12.<br>
According to the invention, it is provided that an evaluating<br>
device is used for calculating the temperature distribution<br>
within the electrical component, wherein the evaluating unit<br>
can be connected to a sensor for measuring the temperature<br>
and/or viscosity of a coolant located in the cooling system and<br>
the evaluating unit controls the cooling element on the basis<br>
of the temperature distribution calculated.<br>
Other advantageous embodiments of the abovementioned invention<br>
are disclosed in the subclaims. The present invention will be<br>
explained in greater detail by means of the figures following,<br>
in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a flowchart of the method according to the<br>
invention;<br><br>
Figure 2 shows the equivalent diagram of the device<br>
according to the invention.<br>
Figure 1 shows a flowchart of the method according to the<br>
invention. On the basis of the temperature measured at the<br>
temperature sensor, the current hot spot temperature (HPT) is<br>
determined by means of the temperature value, defined in the<br>
International standard IEC standard IEC 60354. Furthermore, the<br>
ambient temperature is measured by means of a temperature<br>
sensor 4, the state of the oil (sensor for gas component in the<br>
oil 5.1; oil moisture content sensor 5.2) and the oil level<br>
within the tank is measured by a float 6. Hot spot temperature<br>
(HPT) thus determined is used for the control profile currently<br>
applied to the specific transformer 2 for determining the<br>
ACTUAL temperature of the industrial installation 1. For this<br>
purpose, the optimum control profile for the current operating<br>
state, the current life of the transformer 2 and the optimum<br>
operating states predetermined by the user are selected. If the<br>
optimum control profile is currently not the basis for the<br>
necessary process control, it is read out of a database. On the<br>
basis of the optimum control profile, the current hot spot<br>
temperature (HPT) is compared with the optimum temperature<br>
calculated on the basis of the control profile. In the case<br>
where the hot spot temperature (HPT) corresponds to the NOMINAL<br>
temperature on the basis of the control profile, the system<br>
monitors the hot spot temperature development by means of a<br>
control system 7 and does not switch in any fans 8.1, 8.2, 8.3<br>
and/or pumps 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4 of the cooling circuit in the<br>
cooling system 10. If there is a deviation in the hot spot<br>
temperature (HPT) with respect to the NOMINAL temperature, the<br>
evaluation of the difference of the NOMINAL temperature with<br>
respect to the current hot spot temperature (HPT) is used for<br>
activating the connected fans 8.1, 8.2, 8.3 and/or pumps 9.1/<br>
9.2, 9.3, 9.4 of the cooling circuit. The abovementioned<br>
difference<br><br>
in the temperatures is taken as the basis for deciding that a<br>
cooling capacity must be additionally generated by the cooling<br>
system 10 for adapting the hot spot temperature (HPT) to the<br>
NOMINAL temperature. On the basis of the control profile and<br>
the number and performance of the fans 8.1, 8.2, 8.3 and/or<br>
pumps 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, the control system 7 drives the fan<br>
or fans 8.1, 8.2, 8.3 and/or pumps 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4 with a<br>
corresponding speed or with a corresponding power,<br>
respectively. The forced use of pumps in the cooling system 10<br>
leads to an increased circulation of the coolant in the cooling<br>
system 10 and thus to a heat removal to the environment. This<br>
form of cooling is very quiet. The use of fans 8.1, 8.2, 8.3<br>
leads to an improved heat exchange of the coolant via the heat<br>
exchanger with the environmental air and is noisier, in<br>
contrast to cooling circuit pumps 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4.<br>
Figure 2 shows a circuit arrangement of the device according to<br>
the invention. At the transformer 2, the most varied sensors 3,<br>
4, 5.1, 5.2 are located which provide information on the hot<br>
spot temperature (HPT), the ambient temperature, the gases<br>
dissolved in the transformer, the moisture content of the oil<br>
and the oil level. These sensors 3, 4, 5.1, 5.2, 6 convey the<br>
data measured by them to a central processing unit of the<br>
control system 7. On the basis of these available measurement<br>
data, this central processing unit calculates the current state<br>
of the transformer 2. This current state, thus determined, of<br>
the transformer 2 is compared with a control profile which is<br>
optimum for the current transformer state. If the measured<br>
measurement values deviate from the optimum values according to<br>
the control profile, the fans 8.1, 8.2, 8.3 and/or pumps 9.1,<br>
9.2, 9.3, 9.4 of the cooling system 10 are driven in accordance<br>
with the basic control profile. The control profile ensures<br>
that the fans 8.1, 8.2, 8.3<br><br>
and/or pumps 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4 are optimally matched with<br>
respect to their number and capacity to the required cooling<br>
capacity for adapting the ACTUAL temperature to the NOMINAL<br>
temperature.<br><br>
