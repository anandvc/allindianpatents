Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a water level indicator. Particularly this invention to a water level indicator for bore wells and underground tanks.<br>
Background<br>
The present invention relates to level indicator comprises a sensor adapted to be connected one of its end to a cable which is wound on a rolatable wheel mounted on a stand, the other end of said cable is connected to a circuit having means for an audio and video signals, this circuit having means being connected to the power supply means -fixed on said wheel, a handle being provided with said wheel for facilitating winding and unwinding of said cable thereon, a water level indicators for bore wells and underground tanks are known in the prior art. The common device known in the art is a marked tape used for measuring the water level. Another device known in the prior art as per the Japan patent (JP2001317937) comprises an inner cylinder having the length corresponding to the depth water level in the ground. A plurality of collar parts are provided at prefixed intervals in the axial direction. A water level sensor that is mounted onto the outer-periphery surface corresponding to the part between collar parts of the inner cylinder for detecting the water penetrates from an underground layer of water present there. An outer cylinder is formed by joining semicircular cylindrical parts made of porous material. The outer-periphery part of the inner cyliner is covered using welding, and a screw inserted from the outer-periphery surface of the outer cylinder corresponding to each collar part of the inner cylinder by screwing for closely fixing the outer cylinder with the inner cylinder.<br>
Disadvantages associated with the prior art<br>
There are disadvantages associated with the prior art. One of the main disadvantages is that putting/inserting the tape into the bore well is difficult.<br>
Another disadvantage is that the accurate water level is not ascertainable.<br>
Yet another disadvantage is that construction of the conventional device is very complicated and the maintenance thereof is very costly and difficult.<br>
Still another disadvantage is that the conventional device is not operable by a single person.<br><br>
Objects of the Invention<br>
-	Therefore the main object of the present invention is to provide a novel water level indicator which obviates the disadvantages associated with the prior art.<br>
-	Another object of the present invention is to provide a novel water level indicator, which is of lightweight and simple construction.<br>
-	Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a novel water level indicator which is very easy to handle.<br>
-	Still another object of this invention is to provide a novel water level indicator which provides audio and visual signals for the presence of water.<br>
-	Another object of this invention is to provide a low cost underground water level indicator for borewells and underground tanks.<br>
The following description contains many specifics, these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of the invention, but rather as an exemplification of one preferred embodiment thereof. Many other variations are possible. Accordingly, the scope of the invention should not be limited to the emodiment illustrated, and the alterations and variations may be treated within the spirit and scope of this invention.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
A water level indicator comprising a sensor adapted to be connected one of its end to a cable wound on a rotatable wheel mounted on a stand, the other end of said cable connected to an audio and video signal means provided for indicating water level, said signal means being connected to the power supply means, a handle being provided with said wheel for facilitating winding and unwinding of said cable thereon.<br>
In accordance with this invention of underground water level indicator comprises a sensor connected one of its end to a cable which is wound on a rotatable wheel fixed on a stand. The other end of said cable is connected to a circuit having means for audio and video signals for indicating water level. These said signal means being connected to power supply means fixed on said wheel. Handle being provided to facilitate winding and unwinding the wheel, which Is connected to the stand through a central axis using bearings.<br><br>
Brief Description of Accompanying Drawings<br>
An underground water level indicator to a preferred embodiment is herein described and illustrated in the accompanying drawing wherein;<br>
Fig 1 shows isometric view of the underground water level indicator.<br>
Fig 2 shows the sectional view of the sensor and<br>
Fig 3 shows the preferred embodiment of the arrangement of audiovisual circuit.<br>
Referring to the drawing, Fig 1, a water level indicator comprises a sensor (1) adapted to be connected one of its end to a calibrated cable (2) wound on a rotatable wheel (3) mounted on a stand (4) having means for audio (5) and video (6) signals being provided for indicating water level. The audio video means are preferably a buzzer and LED and which is being connected to the power supply through a switch (8) Handle (7) is being provided to wind and unwind the cable (2).<br>
Referring to drawing, Fig 2, sectional view of the sensor, the sensor (1) comprising plurality of cylindrical hollow tubes (8 and 9) connected each other having holes (10) on one end and being connected to a cable (2). One of the wires (11) within the cable is connected to the iron pipe with nuts (13). Otherwise (12) of the cable reaches the other end of said tube. Hollow portion of the upper portion of said tube (8) sealed with an insulated sealing material for example wax (14). The air holes in the lower portion of said tube (9) facilitate easy contact with water. The tube should be made of a conducting material.<br>
Referring, Fig3, the audiovisual means comprising an integrated circuit (IC) (20) adapted to be connected with a power supply means (21) through a switch (8). A LED (6) being connected to said IC (20) through plurality of resistance (22) and other end of the said LED being connected to the said sensor (1). A Buzzer (5) is being connected to said IC (20) and other end of the said buzzer (5) is connected to the said sensor (1) through a plurality of resistance (23).<br>
During the operation of the device insert the calibrated cable with sensor by rotating the handle connected to the wheel into the bore well. When the tip of the sensor touches the water level the LED glows and the buzzer makes a beep sound. After getting audio and video signal for detection of water, stop the rotation of the wheel and measure the water level looking at the calibrated cable.<br><br><br><br><br>
