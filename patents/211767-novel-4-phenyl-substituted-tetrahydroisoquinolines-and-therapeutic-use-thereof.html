NOVEL 4-PHENYL SUBSTITUTED TETRAHYDROISOQUINOLINES<br>
THERAPEUTIC USE THEREOF<br>
Field of the Invention The present invention relates to compounds, compositions, and methods for the treatment of various neurological and psychological disorders. In particular, the present invention relates to such compounds, compositions and methods wherein the compounds are novel 4-phenyl substituted tetrahydroisoquinoline i derivatives.<br>
Background of the Invention The treatment of a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders, e.g., attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder ("ADHD"), is characterized by a number of side effects believed to be due to the lack of appropriate selectivities in the compounds used for the treatment, e.g., to the compounds' inability to selectively block certain neurochemicals, and not others- ADHD, for example, is a disease affecting 3-6% of school age children, and is also recognized in a percentage of adults. Aside from hampering performance at school and at work ADHD is a significant risk factor for the subsequent development of anxiety disorders, depression, conduct disorder and drug abuse. Since current treatment regimes require psychostimulants, and since a substantial number of patients (30%) are resistant to stimulants or cannot tolerate their side effects, there is a need for a new drug or class of drugs which treats ADHD and does not have resistance or side effect problems. In addition, methylphenidate, the current drug of choice for the treatment of ADHD, induces a number of side effects; these .include anorexia, insomnia and jittery feelings,<br><br>
tics, a's well as increased blood pressure and heart rate secondary to the activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Methylphenidate also has a high selectivity for the dopamine transporter protein over the norepinephrine transporter protein (DAT/NET Ki ratio of 0.1), which can lead to addiction liability and requires multiple doses per day for optimal efficacy.<br>
This invention provides an alternative to such known &gt; treatments with its novel 4-phenyl tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives, said compounds being nowhere described in the art. U.S. Patent No. 3,947,456 (the '456 patent), for example, describes 4-phenyl substituted tetrahydroisoquinolines of the formula;<br><br>
wherein R is hydroxy or lower alkoxy; the '456 patent d-. &gt;s not describe any other groups at this position, let alone the substituents available at the position (R4) in the compounds provided herein. Phenyl-substituted tetrahydroisoquinolines are also described in Mondeshka et al (II Farmaco, 1994,49 pp.<br><br>
475-481).   However, the compounds described therein are not those provided herein.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention provides a compound of the Formula IA, IB, IIA, IIB, IIIA and IIIB, as follows:<br><br><br>
wherein       are as described herein.  In one embodiment, R1 is C1-C6 alkyl; R2 is H, C1-C6 alkyl, C3-C6 cycloalkyl, or Ci~<br>
Cg haloalkyl; R3 is at each occurrence thereof independently H, halogen, C1-C6 alkyl, or C1-C6 alkyl substituted with from 1 to<br><br>
3 of OR8 or NR8R9; R4, R5 and R6 are each independently H or are selected at each occurrence thereof from halogen, -OR10 -<br><br>
cycloalkylalkyl, and wherein each of C1-C6 alkyl, C3-C6 cycloalkyl, and C4-C7 cycloalkylalkyl is optionally substituted with from 1 to 3 substituents independently selected at each occurrence thereof from C1-C3 alkyl, halogen, -CN, -OR8, -NR8R9 and phenyl which is optionally substituted 1-3 times with halogen, -CN, C1-C4 alkyl, C1-C4 haloalkyl, «0R8, or -NR8R9; or<br>
R5 and R6 may be -0-C(R11)2-0-; and, R7-R13, n, and X are as described herein.<br>
Compounds provided herein block the reuptake of norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin with particular selectivity ratios, e.g., being more selective for the norepinephrine transporter (NET) protein than the dopamine transporter (DAT) protein or serotonin transporter (SERT) proteins. Hence, the compounds are useful for selectively treating a variety of neurological and psychological disorders.<br>
Also provided herein is a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula IA, IB, IIA, IIB, IIIA or IIIB. Further provided is a method of treating an mammal afflicted with a neurological or psychological disorder selected from the group consisting of attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, depression,<br><br>

Many geometric isomers of olefins, C=N double bonds, and the like can also be present in the compounds, and all such stable isomers are contemplated in the present invention. Compounds are isolated in either the racemic form, or in the optically pure form, for example, by chiral chromatography or chemical resolution of the racemic form.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of this invention's compounds are also provided for herein.  In this regard, the<br><br>
phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable" is employed to refer to those compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. "Pharmaceutically acceptable salts" refer to derivatives of the disclosed compounds wherein the parent compound is modified by making acid or base salts thereof. Examples of pharmaceutically.acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, mineral or organic acid salts of basic residues such as amines; alkali or organic salts of acidic residues such as carboxylic acids; and the like. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the ■ conventional non-toxic salts or the quaternary ammonium salts of the parent compound formed, for example, from non-toxic inorganic or organic acids. Such conventional non-toxic salts include those derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, sulfamic, phosphoric, nitric, and the like; and the salts prepared from organic acids such as acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, stearic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, pamoic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, phenylacetic, glutamic, benzoic, salicylic, sulfanilic, 2-acetoxybenzoic, fumaric, toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, ethane disulfonic, oxalic, isethionic, and the like.<br>
Prodrug forms of this inventionf s compounds are also provided for herein. Such "prodrugs" are compounds comprising this invention's compounds and moieties covalently bound to the parent compounds such that the portions of the parent compound most likely to be involved with toxicities in subjects to which<br><br>
the prodrugs have been administered are blocked from inducing such effects. However, the prodrugs are also cleaved in the subjects in such a way as to release the parent compound without unduly lessening its therapeutic potential. Prodrugs include compounds wherein hydroxy, amine, or sulfhydryl groups are bonded to any group that, when administered to a mammalian subject, cleaves to form a free hydroxyl, amino, or sulfhydryl group, respectively. Examples of prodrugs include, but are not limited to, acetate, formate, and benzoate derivatives of alcohol, and amine functional groups in the compounds of Formulae (I-III) .<br>
Radiolabelled compounds, i.e. wherein one or more of the atoms described are replaced by a radioactive isotope of that<br>
atom (e.g. C replaced by C or by 11C, and H replaced by ^H or 18F) , are also provided for herein. Such compounds have a variety of potential uses, e.g. as standards and reagents in determining the ability of a potential pharmaceutical to bind to neurotransmitter proteins, or for imaging compounds of this invention bound to biological receptors in vivo or in vitro.<br>
This invention provides compositions containing the compounds described herein, including, in particular, pharmaceutical compositions comprising therapeutically effective amounts of the compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. "Therapeutically effective amounts" are any amounts of the compounds effective to ameliorate, lessen, inhibit or prevent the particular condition for which a subject is being treated. Such amounts generally vary according to a number of factors well within the purview of ordinarily skilled<br><br>
artisans given the description provided herein to determine and account for. These include, without limitation: the particular subject, as well as its age, weight, height, general physical condition and medical history; the particular compound used, as well as the carrier in which it is formulated and the route of administration selected for it; and, the nature and severity of the condition being treated. Therapeutically effective amounts include optimal and suboptimal doses, and can be determined in a variety of ways known to ordinarily skilled artisans, e.g., by administering various amounts of a particular agent to an animal afflicted with a particular condition and then determining the relative therapeutic benefit received by the animal. Said amounts generally range from about 0.001 mg per kg of the body weight of the subject being treated to about 1000 mg per kg, and more typically, from about 0.1 to about 2 00 mg per kg. These amounts can be administered according to any dosing regimen acceptable to ordinarily skilled artisans supervising the treatment.<br>
"Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers" are media generally accepted in the art for the administration of therapeutic compounds to humans. Such carriers are generally formulated according to a number of factors well within the purview of those of ordinary skill in the art to determine and account for. These include, without limitation: the type and nature of the active agent being formulated; the subject to which the agent-containing composition is to be administered; the intended route of administration of the composition; and, the therapeutic indication being targeted. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include both aqueous and non-aqueous liquid media, ' as well as a variety of solid and semi-solid dosage<br><br>
forms. Such carriers can include a number of different ingredients and additives in addition to the active agent, such additional ingredients being included in the formulation for a variety of reasons, e.g., stabilization of the active agent, well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Descriptions of suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers/ and factors involved in their selection, are found in a variety of readily available sources, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17th ed., Mack Publishing Company, Easton, PA, 1985, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Compounds of this invention are administered, for example, parenterally in various aqueous media such as aqueous dextrose and  saline  solutions;  glycol  solutions  are  also  useful carriers.  Solutions for parenteral administration preferably contain a water soluble salt of the active ingredient, suitable stabilizing  agents,  and  if  necessary,  buffer  substances. Antioxidizing agents, such as sodium bisulfite, sodium sulfite, or ascorbic acid, either alone or in combination, are suitable stabilizing agents.  Also used are citric acid and its salts, and EDTA.   In addition,  parenteral  solutions  can contain preservatives such as benzalkonium chloride, methyl- or propylparaben, and chlorobutanol.<br>
Alternatively, the compounds are administered orally in solid dosage forms, such as capsules, tablets and powders; or in liquid forms such as elixirs, syrups, and/or suspensions. Gelatin capsules can be used to contain the active ingredient and a suitable carrier such as but not limited to lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, steric acid, or cellulose derivatives.  Similar diluents can be used to make compressed<br><br>
tablets. Both tablets and capsules can be manufactured as sustained release products, to provide for continuous release of medication over a period of time. Compressed tablets can be sugar-coated or film-coated to mask any unpleasant taste, or used to protect the active ingredients from the atmosphere, or to allow selective disintegration of the tablet in the gastrointestinal tract.<br>
Compounds of this invention provide a particularly beneficial therapeutic index relative to other compounds available for the treatment of similar disorders. Without intending to be limited by theory, it is believed that this is due, at least in part, to the compounds' ability to be selective for the norepinephrine transporter protein (NET) over the other neurotransmitter transporters. Binding affinities are demonstrated by a number of means well known to ordinarily skilled artisans, including, without limitation, those described in the Examples section herein below.<br>
Briefly, for example, protein-containing extracts from cells, e.g., HEK293 cells, expressing the transporter proteins are incubated with radiolabelled ligands for the proteins. The binding of the radioligands to the proteins is reversible in the presence of other protein ligands, e.g., the compounds of this invention; said reversibility, as described below, provides a means of measuring the compounds' binding affinities for the proteins (Ki) . A higher Ki value for a compound is indicative that the compound has less binding affinity for a protein than is so for a compound with a lower Ki; conversely, lower Ki values are indicative of greater binding affinities.<br><br>
Accordingly, a lower Ki for the protein for which the compound is more selective, and a higher Ki for the protein for which the compound is less selective indicate the difference in compound selectivity for proteins. Thus, the higher the ratio in Ki values of a compound for protein A over protein B, the greater is the compounds' selectivity for the latter over the former (the former having a higher Ki and the latter a lower Ki for that compound). Compounds provided herein induce fewer side effects during therapeutic usage because of their selectivity for the norepinephrine transporter protein, as indicated by the ratios of their Ki' s for binding to NET over those for binding to other transporter proteins, e.g., the dopamine transporter (DAT) and the serotonin transporter (SERT). Generally, the compounds of this invention have a Ki ratio for DAT/NET of about _&gt; 2:1; the compounds generally also have a SERT/NET ratio of about &gt; 5:1.<br>
Moreover, in vivo assessment of the activity of compounds at the NE and DA transporters is, for example, by determining their ability to prevent the sedative effects of tetrabenazine (TBZ) (see, e.g., G. Stille, Arzn. Forsch. 1964, 14, 534-537; the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference). Randomized and coded doses of test compounds are administered to mice, as is then a dose of tetrabenazine.  Animals are then evaluated for antagonism of tetrabenazine-induced exploratory loss  and ptosis  at  specified  time  intervals  after drug administration.     Exploratory  activity  is,  for  example, evaluated by placing the animal in the center of a circle and then evaluating the amount of time it takes for the animal to intersect the circle's perimeter - generally, the longer it takes for the animal to make this intersection, the greater is<br><br>
its loss of exploratory activity. Furthermore, an animal is considered to have ptosis if its eyelids are at least 50% closed. Greater than 95% of the control (vehicle-treated) mice are expected to exhibit exploratory loss and ptosis; compound-related activity is then calculated as the percentage of mice failing to respond to the tetrabenazine challenge dose, with therapeutically more effective compounds expected to be better at reducing loss of exploratory behavior and ptosis.<br>
Accordingly,  the  pharmaceutical  compositions  provided herein are useful in the treatment of subjects afflicted with various neurological and psychiatric disorders by administering to  said subjects  a dose  of  a pharmaceutical  composition provided herein.   Said disorders include, without limitation, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder,  supranuclear palsy,  feeding disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder,  analgesia,  smoking cessation,  panic  attacks,  Parkinson's  and  phobia.    The compounds provided herein  are particularly useful  in  the treatment of these and other disorders due, at least in part, to  their ability to  selectively bind to  the  transporter proteins for certain neurochemicals with a greater affinity than to the transporter proteins for other neurochemicals.<br>
Synthesis<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be prepared using the methods described below, together with methods known in the art of synthetic organic chemistry, or variations thereof as appreciated by those skilled in the art. Preferred<br><br>
methods include, but are not limited to, those methods described below.<br>
The novel tetrahydroisoquinoline reuptake inhibitors of Formulae (I-IIIB) of this invention can be prepared by the<br>
general scheme outlined below (Schemes 1-4). The R^-substituted N-benzyl amines of Formula (V) of Scheme 1, may be purchased from commercial sources, or alternatively, obtained from a simple reductive amination protocol.   Thus, carbonyl<br>
containing compounds of Formula (IV) may be treated with H2N-RI<br>
in lower alkyl alcoholic solvents (preferably methanol or ethanol) at temperatures at or below room temperature. The resulting imine may be reduced most commonly with alkaline earth borohydrides (preferably sodium borohydride) to provide the desired amine intermediates and the reductions are optimally conducted at or below room temperature.<br>
Treatment of benzyl amine intermediates of Formula (V) with the electrophile intermediates of Formula (VII) generates the alkylation products of Formula (VIII). The alkylation reactions may be run under a wide variety of conditions familiar to one skilled in the art of organic synthesis. Typical solvents include acetonitrile, toluene, diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylformamide, methylene chloride, and lower alkyl alcohols including ethanol.<br>
The reactions may be conducted at temperatures ranging from 0°C up to the boiling point of the solvent employed. Reaction progress is conventionally monitored by standard chromatographic and spectroscopic methods. The alkylation reaction is  optionally run with the  addition of  a non-<br><br>
nucleophilic  organic! base  such as,  but	not  limited  to,<br>
pyridine,   triethylamine  and  diisopropyl	ethylamine,  and<br>
reaction times may vary from 1 hour to	several days  to<br>
complete.<br>
The aforementioned electrophilic intermediate of Formula (VII) is conveniently purchased from commercial sources or prepared via treatment of an optionally substituted acetophenone of Formula (VI) with common brominating agents such as, but not limited to, bromine, NBS, or tetrabutylammonium tribromide which readily affords the desired bromoacetophenones of Formula (VII). These reactions are optimally conducted in acetic acid or methylene chloride with methanol used as a co-solvent for the tribromide reagent with reaction temperatures at or below room temperature. Another embodiment of this methodology would include the use of chloroacetophenone compounds of Formula (VII).<br>
The acetophenones of Formula (VI) are also in turn available from commercial sources or are conveniently obtained via several well known methods, including the treatment of the corresponding benzoic acid intermediates with two stoichiometric equivalents of methyllithium (see, e.g. , Jorgenson, M.J. (Organic Reactions, 1970, 18, pg. 1)). Alternatively, one may treat the corresponding benzaldehydes with an alkyl-Grignard (for example, MeMgBr) or alkyl-lithium (for example, MeLi) nucleophile follwed by routine oxidation to the ketone (see, e.g., Larock, R. C. (Comprehens ive Organic Transformations, VCH Publishers, New York, 1989, p. 604)).<br><br>
Reductions of compounds of Formula (VIII) to the benzyl alcohols of Formula (IX) proceeds with many reducing agents including, for example, sodium borohydride, lithium borohydride, borane, diisobutylaluminum hydride, and lithium aluminum hydride. The reductions are carried out for a period of time between 1 hour to 3 days at room temperature or elevated temperature up to the reflux point of the solvent employed. If borane is used, it may be employed as a complex for example, but not limited to, borane-methyl sulfide complex, borane-piperidine complex, or borane-tetrahydrofuran complex. One skilled in the art will understand the optimal combination of reducing agents and reaction conditions needed or may seek guidance from the text of Larock, R.C. (see above).<br>
Compounds  of  Formula  (IX)  may  be  cyclized  to  the<br>
tetrahydroisoquinoline compounds of Formula (lb) wherein R^=H of this invention by brief treatment with a strong acid. Suitable acids include, but are not limited to, concentrated sulfuric acid, polyphosphoric acid, methanesulfonic acid and trifluoroacetic acid. The reactions are run neat or in the optional presence of a co-solvent such as, for example, methylene chloride or 1,2-dichloroethane.  The cyclizations may<br>
be conducted at temperatures ranging from 0°C up to the reflux point of the solvent employed. One skilled in the art of heterocyclic chemistry will readily understand these conditions or may consult the teachings of Mondeshka, et al. (II Farmaco, 1994, 49, 475-480) or Venkov, et al. (Synthesis, 1990, 253-255) . Cyclizations may also be effected by treatment of compounds of Formula (IX) with strong Lewis acids, such as for example, aluminum trichloride typically in halogenated solvents<br><br>
such as methylene chloride.  One skilled in	the art will be<br>
familiar with the precedent taught by Kaiser,	et al. (J. Med.<br>
Chem. , 1984, 27, 28-35) and Wyrick, et al.	(J. Med. Chem. ,<br>
1981, 24, 1013-1015).<br>
Compounds of Formulae (I-III) may be obtained in enantiomerically pure (R) and (S) form by crystallization with chiral salts as well known to one skilled in the art, or alternatively, may be isolated through chiral HPLC employing commercially available chiral columns.<br>
Compounds of Formulae (I-III) wherein R^=OH in Schemes 1, 3 and 4 of this invention may be prepared according to the teaching of Kihara, et al. (Tetrahedron, 1992, 48/ 67-78), and Blomberg, et al. (Synthesis, 1977, p. 18-30). Thus ketone compounds of Formula (VIII) which possess an ortho-iodide on the aromatic ring undergoing cyclization may be treated with strong bases, such as, but not limited to, lower alkyl (Ci_g)<br>
lithium bases (preferably t-BuLi or n-BuLi) to afford the anticipated halogen-metal exchange followed by intramolecular Barbier cyclization to generate compounds of Formulae (I-III)<br>
wherein R7=OH. Inert solvents such as dialkyl ethers (preferably diethyl ether), cyclic ethers (preferably tetrahydrofuran  or  1,4-dioxane),  etc.  are  necessary,  and<br>
reaction temperatures are kept low (-78°C to -25°C) to avoid by-products. Alternatively, halogen-metal exchange may also be effected in the presence of zerovalent nickel, in which case N,N-dialkylformamides (preferably dimethylformamide) serve as ideal solvents. This cyclization is best performed when X=Br to  avoid  over-reduction  or   intermolecular  reactivity.<br><br>
Additionally, compounds of Formulae (I-III) wherein R7=OH may be readily alkylated (vide supra) to afford compounds Formulae<br>
(I-III)  wherein  R7=ORlO.    Finally,  further  treatment  of<br>
compounds of Formulae (I-III) wherein R7=OH with a halogenating reagent or specifically a fluorinating reagent such as, but not limited to,  diethylaminosulfur  trifluoride  (DAST),  readily<br>
provides compounds of Formulae (I-III) wherein R7=F. Further reference may be gained from the review of Hudlicky (Organic Reactions, 1985, 35, p. 513-637).<br>
In reference to precursor compounds of Formula (IV) , for those reagents that may be commercially unavailable, numerous synthetic routes from other commercial compounds or compounds known in the art exist and these will be readily evident to anyone skilled in the art of organic synthesis. Without limitation, a representative method is shown in Scheme 2, wherein the allyl alcohol of Formula (X) is subjected to ready ozonolysis followed by reductive workup with reagents, such as, but not limited to, dimethyl sulfide to afford a lactol which is treated with mild acid under a wide range of conditions to afford benzofuran of Formula (XI). Methodology for functional group interconversion of the ester to aldehyde will be readily apparent to a skilled artisan to provide those targets of Formula (IV) .<br>
Furthermore, pre-cyclization amino alcohols of Formula (XII) of Scheme 3 and Formulae (XIII-XIV) of Scheme 4 are synthesized in completely analagous manner to those methods described hereinabove for the preparation of pre-cyclization amino alcohol of Formula (IX) of Scheme 1.  Also as described<br><br>
above, * the pre-cyclization amino alcohols of Formula (XII) of Scheme 3 and Formulae (XIII-XIV) of Scheme 4 may be cyclized as described to afford the target tetrahydroisoguinolines of Formula (la) of Scheme 3 and Formulae (Ila, lib, Ilia and Illb) of Scheme 4. It will be readily understood by anyone skilled in the art that regiomeric tetrahydroisoguinolines are afforded upon the cyclization of compounds of Formulae (XIII-XIV).<br>
In a further embodiment of this invention the unsaturated furan,  indole,  and  thiophene  tetrahydroisoguinolines  of Formulae (I-III) may be partially reduced to the corresponding dihydro furan,     dihydro indo1e,     and     dihydrothi ophene tetrahydroisoguinolines of Formulae (I-III).   Reductions are conducted in the presence of hydrogen, either at atmospheric pressure or at elevated pressure and in a wide range of solvents, such as, but not limited to, methanol, ethanol, and ethyl acetate.  The reactions are optimally conducted in the presence of a metal catalyst, such as, but not limited to, palladium,  platinum,  or rhodium.    Optimal conditions  for hydrogenation  will  be  readily  understood  by  the  skilled artisan; alternatively, one may consult the text of Larock, R. C.  (Comprehensive Organic Transformations, VCH Publishers, New York, 1989, p. 6.<br>
In cases where partial reduction of the above mentioned heterocycles is not possible (on compound lb wherein R7=H) due to concomitant hydrogenolysis of pendant aryl substituents (eg. CI) , it is necessary to reduce the heterocyclic moiety (i.e. benzofuran, indole or thiophene) at an earlier stage (Scheme 1, intermediate (V) ) in the synthesis and then introduce the pendant aryl (VII) by the same methods outlined in Scheme 1.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
This* invention will be better understood by reference to the following Examples section.   However, those of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that the examples are merely illustrative of the invention as defined in the claims, which follow thereafter.<br>

BINDING ASSAYS Primary binding assays:<br>
In order to evaluate the relative affinity of the various compounds at the NE, DA and 5HT transporters, HEK293E cell lines were developed to express each of the three human transporters. cDNAs containing the complete coding regions of each transporter were amplified by PCR from human brain libraries. The cDNAs contained in pCRII vectors were sequenced to verify their identity and then subcloned into an Epstein-Barr virus based expression plasmid (E. Shen, GM Cooke, RA Horlick, Gene 156:235-239, 1995). This plasmid containing the coding sequence for one of the human transporters was transfected into HEK293E cells.   Successful transfection was<br><br>
testing,■ are housed a minimum of06 days under carefully controlled environmental conditions (22.2 + 1.1 C; 50% average humidity; 12 hr lighting cycle/24 hr) . Mice are fasted overnight (16-22 hr) prior to testing. Mice are placed into clear polycarbonated "shoe" boxes (17 cm x 28.5 cm x 12 cm) . Randomized and coded doses of test compounds are administered p.o. A 45 mg/kg dose of tetrabenazine is administered i.p. 30 minutes prior to score time. All compounds are administered in a volume of 0.1 ml/10 gm body weight. Animals are evaluated for antagonism of tetrabenazine induced exploratory loss and ptosis at specified time intervals after drug administration. At the designated time interval, mice are examined for signs of exploratory activity and ptosis. Exploratory activity is evaluated by placing the animal in the center of a 5 inch circle. Fifteen seconds are allowed for the animal to move and intersect the perimeter. This is considered antagonism of tetrabenazine and given a score of 0. Failure" to leave the circle is regarded as exploratory loss and given a score of 4. An animal is considered to have ptosis if its eyelids are at least 50% closed and given a score of 4 if completely closed; no closure is given a score of 0. Greater than 95% of the control (vehicle-treated) mice are expected to exhibit exploratory loss and ptosis. Drug activity is calculated as the percentage of mice failing to respond to the tetrabenazine challenge dose.<br>

For binding, cells were homogenised, centrifuged and then resuspended in incubation buffer (50mM Tris, 120mM NaCl, 5mM KC1, pH 7.4). Then the appropriate radioligand was added. For NET binding, [3H] Nisoxetine (86.0 Ci/mmol, NEN/DuPont) was added to a final concentration of approximately 5 nM. For DAT binding, [3H] WIN 35,428 (84.5 Ci/mmol) at 15 nM was added. For 5HTT binding, [3H] Citolapram (85.0 Ci/mmol) at 1 nM was added. Then various concentrations (10A-5 to 10^-11 M) of the compound of interest were added to displace the radioligand. Incubation was carried out at room temperature for 1 hour in a 96 well plate. Following incubation, the plates were placed on a harvester and washed quickly 4 times with (50mM tris, 0.9% NaCl, pH 7.4) where the cell membranes containing the bound radioactive label were trapped on Whatman GF/B filters. Scintillation cocktail was added to the filters which were then counted in a Packard TopCount. Binding affinities of the compounds of interest were determined by non-linear curve regression using GraphPad Prism 2.01 software. Non-specific binding was determined by displacement with 10 micromolar mazindol.<br>
