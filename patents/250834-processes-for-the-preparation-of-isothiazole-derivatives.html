				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION <br>
This invention relates to processes for preparing isothiazole derivatives that are useful in the treatment of hyperproliferative diseases, such as cancers, in mammals. It is known that polypeptide growth factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which has a high affinity for the human kinase insert-domain-containing receptor (KDR) or the murine fetal liver kinase 1 (FLK-1) receptor, have been associated with the proliferation of endothelial cells and more particularly to vasculogenesis" and angiogenesis. The present invention provides a process for preparing compounds that are capable of binding to or modulating the KDR/FLK-1 receptor. The compounds may be used to treat disorders related to vasculogenesis or angiogenesis such as diabetes, diabetic retinopathy, hemangioma, glioma, melanoma, Kaposi's sarcoma and ovarian, breast, lung, pancreatic, prostate, colon and epidermoid cancer.<br>

PETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The compounds of Formula I are useful as agents for binding or modulating<br>
KDR/FLK-1 receptors and are thus useful in the treatment of hyperproliferative diseases, such<br>
as cancers in mammals.<br>
The process of the present invention in its first aspect concerns preparing the<br>
isothiazole derivatives of Formula I. Compounds of the Formula I may be prepared according<br>
to the following reaction scheme and discussion. Unless otherwise indicated, R1, R2, R3, R4,<br>
R5, R6, R7, RB, R9 and R10 in the reaction scheme and discussion that follow are as defined<br>
With reference to Scheme 1 above, the compound of Formula I may be prepared by<br>
treating a malonate diester (XIII) with base and carbon disulfide (reaction a), followed by<br>
treatment with an alkylating agent to provide an (alkyl)sulfanyl-ethenethiol anion (XI) (reaction<br>
b). Amination of the (alkyl)sulfanyl-ethenethiol anion via an electrophilic aminating agent<br>
yields the 5-(alkyl)sulfanyl isothiazole (VIII) (reaction c). Oxidation of the isothiazole (VIII)<br>
with an oxidizing agent in a suitable solvent yields either the 5-(alkyl)sulfonyl isothiazole when<br>
n=2; or 5-(alkyl)sulfinyl isothiazole when n=1 (VII) (reaction d). Alternatively, the isothiazole,<br>
VIII, may be protected with a suitable protecting group (PG) to give a compound of general<br>
Formula X (reaction e), which may then be treated with an oxidizing agent in a suitable<br>
solvent to prepare compounds of general Formula IX (reaction f). Compounds of general<br>
-27-<br>
formula IX may then be deprotected to give compounds of 5-(alkyl)sulfonyl (or sulfinyl)<br>
isothiazole. VII. This mechanism is illustrated in Scheme 2 below.<br>
Referring back to Scheme 1, the 5-(alkyl)sulfonyl/sulfinyl isothiazole VII is treated with<br>
a compound of general formula R3X (VI), typically under basic conditions, to yield an<br>
isothiazole (V) now having alkoxy functionality at position three (3) of the isothiazole (reaction<br>
h). This reaction is particularly and unexpectedly advantageous when compound VI is a<br>
tosylate and the conditions include a base in a dipolar aprotic solvent. The reaction under<br>
these conditions proceeds in unusually high O:N selectivity where alkylation takes place on<br>
the hydroxyl group instead of the nitrogen atom of the isothiazole ring. Under the appropriate<br>
conditions O:N selectivity approximates a ratio of 35:1 O:N selectivity.<br>
Alkylations of a variety of substituted 3-hydroxyisothiazoles have been reported in the<br>
literature. Mixtures of O- and N-alkylated products were observed in all cases, with a wide<br>
variety of electrophiles (alkyl halides, alkyl sulfates, diazomethane), solvents (water, acetone,<br>
DMSO, DMF, MeCN, DME) and bases (NaOH, K2CO3, Li2CO3l Ag2CO3) being used. For<br>
example, a thorough study on the alkylation of 3-hydroxyisothiazole is reported in<br>
Tetrahedron, 1970; (26), 2497-2506:<br>

The alkylation step (reaction h) in the process of the present invention proceeds with<br>
very high O:N selectivity, namely, approximately 35:1 for the. conditions described in the<br>
experimental procedure of Example seven (7) discussed below, which is much higher than<br>
the selectivity ratios published in the references cited herein.<br>
Referring again to Scheme 1, the alkoxylated isothiazole (V) is treated with a source<br>
of ammonia in a suitable solvent converting the sulfonyl/sulfinyl moiety at position five (5) of<br>
the isothiazole to a primary amine (IV) (reaction i). A compound of general Formula IV may<br>
be combined with a secondary amine and a carbonyl source, with or without an added base,<br>
in a suitable solvent to give the compound of general Formula II, replacing the primary amine<br>
with ureido functionality at position five (5) on the isothiazole. A second treatment with an<br>
ammonia source converts the alkyl ester to an amide providing the compound of general<br>
(Figure Removed)The starting materials employed in Scheme I are readily commercially available or<br>
readily prepared using methods well known in the art.<br>
In each of the reactions discussed or illustrated in the Schemes, pressure is not<br>
critical unless otherwise indicated. Pressures from about 0.5 atmospheres to about 5<br>
atmospheres are generally acceptable, and ambient pressure, i.e., about 1 atmosphere, is<br>
preferred as a matter of convenience.<br>
The examples and preparations provided below further illustrate and exemplify the<br>
compounds of the present invention, methods of preparing such compounds, and the<br>
methods of the present invention. It is to be understood that the scope of the present<br>
invention is not limited in any way by the scope of the following examples and preparations.<br>
In the following examples molecules with a single chiral center, unless otherwise noted, exist<br>
as a racemic mixture. Those molecules with two or more chiral centers, unless otherwise<br>
noted, exist as a racemic mixture of diastereomers. Single enantiomers/diastereomers may<br>
be obtained by methods known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The present invention is illustrated by the following Examples. It will be understood,<br>
however, that the invention is not limited by the specific details of the following Examples.<br>
A reaction vessel was charged with acetonitrile (240 ml, 6 volumes) followed by 1 ,8-<br>
diazabicyclo-[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (2.1 equivalents, 96. 8g). The mixture was cooled to 5"C<br>
under nitrogen atmosphere. Dimethyl malonate (1.0 equiv, 40.0 g) was added over 10-15<br>
minutes. The mixture was held for 30-45 minutes at 5°C, Carbon disulfide (1.0 equiv, 23.1 g)<br>
was added over 10-15 minutes, and then the mixture was held for 60-70 minutes at 5°C.<br>
Dimethyl sulfate (1.05 equiv, 40.1 g) was added over 10-15 minutes, arid then the mixture<br>
was held at 5°C for 16 hours. The mixture containing 2,2-Bis-methoxycarbonyl-1-<br>
methylsulfanyl-ethenethiol anion was finally warmed to 25°C over 3d minutes, and held at<br>
25°C for 1-2 hours.<br>
A separate reaction vessel was charged with water (280 ml, 7 volumes) and sodium<br>
hydrogencarbonate (1 .5 equiv, 38.2 g). The water/ sodium hydrogencarbonate mixture was<br>
cooled to 5°C under nitrogen atmosphere. Hydroxylamine-O-sulfonic acid (1.2 equiv, 41.1 g)<br>
was added over 5 minutes, and the mixture was stirred 15-30 minutes. The 2,2-Bismethoxycarbonyl-<br>
1-methylsulfanyl-ethenethiol anion/acetonitrile solution from Example 1 was<br>
added over 60-70 minutes. The mixture was warmed to 25°C over 1 hour, then held for 16<br>
hours at 25°C. Most of the acetonitrile was removed by vacuum distillation (1 30 Torr, 50°C).<br>
The residue was cooled to room temperature, acidified to pH -1 by addition of 37%<br>
hydrochloric acid (32 mL). The solids were granulated for 16 hours at 25°C. The slurry was<br>
filtered, and the filter cake was washed 3 x 100 mL with water, once with 200 mL 1:3 ethyl<br>
acetate:hexanes (v/v), and once with 100 mL 1:3 ethyl acetate:hexanes (v/v). The wet cake<br>

cooled to 0°C and stirred at 600 rpm. Anhydrous ammonia gas was charged carefully,<br>
keeping the temperature below 10°C. Once a steady pressure of around 10 psi was<br>
maintained, the mixture was heated to 40°C. The pressure increased to about 45 psi. The<br>
pressure was adjusted to 50 psi and stirred at 600 rpm and 40°C for 90 hours. The stir rate<br>
