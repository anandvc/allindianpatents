				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates to an improved insulation and a process for making the same<br>
for manufacturing high voltage AC or DC electrical coils suitable for operation in highly<br>
humid and polluted environment.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present requirement of mass rapid movement in metropolitan cities requires<br>
various modes of transports and the one that is being preferred world wide Is of<br>
electrical multiple unit or EMU locomotives employing 3 phase AC traction motors for<br>
efficient operation. The conversion of single phase overhead traction power to three<br>
phase requires high voltage electronic invertors and high voltage reactors or inductors<br>
to have smooth three phase sinusoidal AC voltage to drive the three phase traction<br>
motors.<br>
To have increased efficiency it requires that the total electrical equipment is made as<br>
low in weight as possible. The reactors or inductors are bulky and heavy electrical<br>
components and contribute significantly to the overall weight of the electrical<br>
equipment thus, a reduction in weight of these inductors makes possible substantial<br>
higher efficiency.<br>
Normally the inductors and reactors are made oil cooled alongwith the main traction<br>
transformer, due to the requirement of handling of large amount of power and<br>
operation at high voltage and inert atmosphere. To achieve reduced weight, while<br>
delivering the maximum output, the present invention describes an improved<br>
insulation that enables operation of inductors and reactors in air cooled environment<br>
resulting in significant reduction in weight and improvement of traction efficiency.<br>
z-<br><br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore, an object of the present invention to propose an improved insulation<br>
and a process of mal<ing thereof the same which eliminates disadvantages of prior></ing>
art.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose an improved insulation and a<br>
process of making the same which is electrically sufficient to withstand high voltage<br>
irrespective of operating temperature.<br>
A still another object of the present invention is to propose an improved insulation<br>
and a process of making the same which is water resistant.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to propose a process of making the same<br>
which reduces the weight of the insulator.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The inductor and reactor coils can be made of various constructions, like colls wound<br>
in disc shape or spirally wound in cylindrical shape. The coil windings material<br>
employed can be copper/ aluminium depending up on the overall rating space<br>
requirement and user preference.<br>
To have lowest weight it is needed to have maximum possible current density in the<br>
winding without exceeding the insulation temperature. To achieve this it is also<br>
required that the insulation should be of suitable thickness so that it provides<br>
sufficient electrical insulation while allowing proper heat dissipation. Unlike oil cooled<br>
equipment, where the insulation is protected by sealed oil filled tank, when the<br>
windings are air cooled, the insulation is also required to be resistant to moisture and<br>
conductive layers of contamination that settle on the winding during operation. In the<br>
present invention all the above goals are achieved by using a layer of special moisture<br>
-3-<br><br>
resistant polyimide insulation, followed by a layer of fibre glass insulation on the<br>
winding wire.<br>
The special water resistant polyimide insulation is suitable for operating temperature<br>
of more than ZOQOC and is having a radial insulation thickness of 0.15mm. Combined<br>
with glass insulating layer, provided for mechanical protection of polyimide film, the<br>
total radial insulation thickness on the conducting wire is of only 0.2mm. This allows<br>
proper heat dissipation while providing sufficient electrical insulation. The conductor<br>
wires with this insulation are wound with required no. of turns into complete coils.<br>
After winding of coils these are assembled, with or without core, as per the design,<br>
and the same are impregnated with high temperature resistant insulating varnish by<br>
using VPI, vacuum pressure impregnation process. A further layer of silicone<br>
conformal coating is provided on the coils after vacuum pressure impregnation.<br>
The overall radial insulation layer thickness over the main electrically charged current<br>
carrying conductors, with the above process, is about 0.3mm to 0.35mm only. This<br>
insulation is electrically sufficient to withstand high voltage while limiting the desired<br>
operating temperature. The water resistant insulation makes the windings and the<br>
inductors or reactors suitable for continuous operation under most humid coastal<br>
conditions, having very high humidity of more than 95% to perpetual continuous<br>
precipitation. The windings remain intact, unaffected and impervious to corrosive<br>
effects of layers of moisture absorbing conductive insulation, which becomes highly<br>
conductive under high humid conditions, even after long service life.<br>
The overall design makes it possible to reduce the weight of heavy inductors and<br>
reactors resulting in efficient operation of the associated utilities.<br>
