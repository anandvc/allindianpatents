				<td>TELECOMMUNICATION^ APPARATUS AND METHOD Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to system and methods for communicating internet packet data via packet radio networks, such as, for example, a network operating in accordance with the General Packet Radio Service(GPRS). Background of the Invention<br>
The GPRS has been developed to communicate internet packets via a radio access interface. A GPRS network can be formed using a Global System for Mobiles (GSM) or a Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) backbone network. GPRS provides support for packet-orientated services and attempts to optimise network and radio resources for packet data communications such as for example Internet Protocol (IP). The GPRS provides a logical architecture, which is related to the circuit switched architecture of a mobile radio system.<br>
The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is a body which is responsible for developing internet protocols for facilitating communications via the internet. For example, a well established internet protocol is the internet protocol version 4 (IPv4) which has been developed and standardised for personal computers to access the internet. The IETF has also developed a further standard known as the internet protocol version 6 (IPv6) which provides an improvement with respect to the IPv4 in terms of facilitating mobile communications and increased addressing options for user equipment. Whilst there are similarities between IPv4 and IPv6, a packet radio network which has been established to support IPv4 will expect internet packets according to the IPv4 and not IPv6.<br>
 <br>
Summary of Invention<br>
According to die present invention there is provided a telecommunications system for communicating internet packet data in accordance with a first internet protocol via a packet radio network operable in accordance a second internet protocol. The system comprises a user equipment operable to request a bearer for communicating internet protocol data according to the second internet protocol to and from a gateway support node of the packet radio network. The gateway support node is operable to establish a tunnelling protocol bearer for communicating the internet packet data to and from the user equipment across the packet radio network. The user equipment is operable in combination with the gateway support node to form a link local address. The link local address comprises an interface identifier including a tunnelling end identifier of the tunnelling protocol bearer which ends at a gateway support node of the core network part of the packet radio network. The link local address also includes an address component which identifies the address as being local to the packet radio network according to the first internet protocol. The user equipment is operable in combination with the gateway support node to communicate a request for an internet protocol address according to the first internet protocol to an address allocation server using the link local address. The user equipment is operable in combination with the gateway support node to receive an allocated internet protocol address according to the first internet protocol, and to communicate with the user equipment using the allocated internet protocol address.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention provide a facility for generating a link local address which can be routed according to the first internet protocol to a server. As such the link local address can be used to acquire an internet protocol address from an address allocation_.seJrver according to the first internet protocol. The acquired address can therefore be used to communicate internet protocol data, replacing the link local address with the acquired address of the user equipment.<br>
The user equipment may be operable to inform the gateway support node mat the internet packet data is to be communicated using the allocated address, source and destination addresses of the internet packet data being in accordance with the first internet protocol. The gateway support node may be operable to adapt a traffic flow<br>
 <br>
template (TFT) to identify the established bearer from a source address of a correspondent node, which is in accordance with the first internet protocol address. As known by those skilled in the art, the traffic template flow (TFT) within the gateway support node performs a function of policing usage of resources on the packet radio network, and for routing received internet packets via an appropriate bearer. According to existing standards, for example, the GPRS standard as defined by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), the gateway support node is defined to have a TFT function. The TFT routes internet packet data to the user equipment via the packet radio network in accordance with a source address of the internet packet data received from a packet data network to which the packet radio network is connected. Existing GPRS networks, which are arranged to support internet protocol communications according to a second internet protocol, for example IPv4, will not recognise internet packet data according to the first internet protocol, for example IPv6. The &amp;St internet packets would therefore be dropped. This is because the bearer established by the gateway support node for communicating internet packets will be a bearer according to the second internet protocol. The TFT would therefore expect a second internet protocol address as a source address. Embodiments of the present invention include a modified gateway support node which can be instructed by the user equipment to adapt the TFT to accept a source address of a correspondent node, which is an internet protocol address according to the first internet protocol. The TFT can therefore route internet packet data to the user equipment using the source address of the correspondent node, which is an address according to the first internet protocol.<br>
In some embodiments, the first internet protocol may be the Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) and the second internet protocol may be the Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4).<br>
Embodiments of the present invention can provide a facility for a user equipment to run application programs which require the use of IPv6 internet protocol communications to access services using a packet radio system network which has been arranged to communicate internet packets according to a different internet protocol (IPv4), The packet radio network may be for example a GPRS network.<br>

Description of the Example Embodiments<br>
Embodiments described below provide mechanisms for supporting IPv6 traffic across IPv4 only GPRSAMTS network. A 3G operator is thereby able to support IPv6 network using their existing IPv4 only UMTS and thus risks associated with an early introduction of IPv6 IMS are minimised.<br>
1.  Example of a GPRS Network<br>
Figure 1 provides a schematic block diagram of a system for communicating<br>
internet packets according to a first (IPv6) internet protocol via a packet radio system network i which has been developed to support the communication of internet packets according to a second (IPv4) internet protocol standard. In Figure 1 a user equipment (UE) 2, is arranged to host an application program providing, for example a multimedia service to a user. The application program may require, for example, access to an internet protocol multimedia subsystem (EMS) such as that developed by the 3GPP to provide multimedia services to users using a UMTS backbone network.<br>
For the present example the packet radio system network 1 is a General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) network. For simplicity Figure 1 shows elements of a GPRS network which are a GPRS Gateway Service Node (GGSN) 3, Serving GRPS Support Nodes (SGSN) 4, Radio Network Controllers (RNC) 8 and Node B elements 10.<br>
The present technique concerns internet protocol communications between a correspondent node (CN) 12 and a UE 2 attached to the GPRS network 1. The CN 12' is shown in Figure 1 as being attached to a Packet Data Network (PDN) 15, which is connected to the GPRS network, To communicate internet packet data between the CN and the UE a bearer is established across the GRPS network as illustrated in Figure 2.<br>
In Figure 2, a bearer 14 is established between the GGSN 3 and the UE 2 for communicating internet packets 5, having a header 7 containing an address and payload data 9 to and from the UE 2 and the CN 12. Generally, the GGSN 4 and the SGSN 6 form parts of a core network, CN. For the core network, the bearer is formed by a GPRS Tunnelling Protocol (GTP) bearer. The radio network controller RNC 8 and the Node B 10 form part of a radio network RN. For the radio network RN, the bearer is formed from a Radio Access Bearer (RAB) tunnelling protocol bearer. The<br>
 <br>
bearer is arranged to communicate internet packets 16 between the UE and the GGSN. The internet packets have an address 18 and a payload 20.<br>
For the present example, the UE 2 is running an application program, which requires the support of, for example, IMS services. However, IMS has been developed and standardised in accordance with the IPv6 internet protocol standard, whereas the GPRS network 1 has been developed to support IPv4 internet protocol communications. As will be explained shortly, according to the present technique a bearer is established for the UE 2 for conveying IPv6 internet packets via the GPRS network to the CN 12. To this end, the present technique is arranged to generate a link local address which can then be used to acquire via the bearer 14 an IPv6 address which can then be used to communicate internet packets via the GPRS network. As shown in Figure 2, the IPv6 address is acquired from an address allocation server 17. The address allocation server 17 may be a DHCP server, which is a staterul address allocation server, known to those skilled in the art.<br>
According to the present technique the UE informs the GGSN of the acquired address so that the GGSN can modify its operation to route internet packets in accordance with an IPv6 address. This is because a Traffic Flow Template (TFT) 19 which is responsible for routing the down-link internet packets (CN to UE) via the appropriate bearer by identifying the appropriate bearer using the source address of the internet packets. The TFT 19 can be established to recognise either an IPv6 address or an IPv4 address. Therefore once the UE has acquired the IPv6 address from the address allocation server 17, the UE informs the TFT in the GGSN 3, that the source address with which to identify the established bearer will be an IPv6 address.<br>
In order to provide an arrangement whereby the user equipment UE can construct an address, referred to as a link-local address, in order to acquire an IPv6 address, a tunnelling end point identifier (TEID) is required. Address construction is explained in the following section. More general information concerning the construction of IPv6 addresses is provided in Annex 1.<br>
2. Constructing the IPv6 Link Local Address   for Tunnelling   IPv6 packets across GPRS/UMTS<br>
The present technique utilises a tunnel end point identifier of a GPRS tunnelling protocol bearer to define an interface identifier from which an IPv6 link-<br>
 <br>
local address can be formed. The interface identifier can be used to form an IPv6 compatible address which can be tunnelled automatically by the GPRS network and so is referred to as the GPRS Automatic Tunnelling (GAT) Interface ID. The GAT interface ID is defined using a GPRS Tunnelling Protocol Tunnel Endpoint Identifier which is defined as (TS29.060). The form of the TEID is shown in Figure 3 a for data transmission and Figure 3b for control plane data.<br>
An example of an interface identifier which can be used to form an address, which is compatible with IPv6 in accordance with IPv6 Addressing Architecture (RFC2373, Appendix A), uses the TEID in combination with a company identifier. The interface identifier has 64 bits and uses a Modified IEEE EUI-64 format. The TEID is used to construct the RFC2373 compliant Interface identifier.  The address is constructed as shown in Figures 4a and 4b, where "c" is assigned to the company_jd, and "g" is a field providing the individual/group significance. There are two forms of GAT_ID_I address, one is a local unique IEEE EUI-64 address as shown in Figure 4a, and the other is a globally unique IEEE EUI-64 address as shown in Figure 4b. Transferring TEIP's toUE'<br>
So as to construct the interface ID, the UE must be informed of the TEID of the GTP bearer which is established by the GGSN. In "conventional" PDP Context Activation, the TEID is used for local use within the RNC, SGSN and the GGSN. Due to the need by the UE to construct the interface ID using the TEID, the TEID needs to be passed to the UE's. In a first example the TEID is passed to the UE directly. In this case the SGSN may choose to pass one or all three pairs of TEID (6 in total) to the UE using the Protocol Configuration Option (PCO) field in PDP Context Activation Accept.<br>
In a second example the GGSN uses one of its TEID to construct an IPv6 link-local address according to its addressing policies and then passes it to the SGSN in the PCO field of the PDP Context Create Response Message. The SGSN in turn, pass this GGSN constructed IPv6 address to the UE using the PCO field of the PDP Context Activation Accept message. The Formation of Link-Local Address<br>
A more specific example of a link-local address is shown in Figure 6. According to RFC2373, an IPv6 packet with site-local or link-local source or<br>
 <br>
destination addresses must not be forwarded by routers outside of the site. These addresses are intended to be used for purposes such as automatic address configuration, neighbour discovery, or when no routers are present. The address of Figure 6 can be used for intra-Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) communications between UE's, i.e. the UE peers are located in the same PLMN and no packets are routed out via the Gi interface to PDN of Figure 1. 3. Summary of Operation<br>
According to the present technique, the telecommunications system illustrated in Figures 1 and 2 operates to provide a Link local address and uses the link local address to acquire an IPv6 address. The operations performed by the UE and the GGSN are summarised by the flow diagrams shown in Figure 7, 8 and 9. Figure 7 provides an illustration of a general operation of the system, whereby the UE acquires an IPv6 address and the GGSN adapts the TFT to recognise the IPv6 compatible address. Figure 7 is summarised as follows:<br>
S101: UE requests a bearer from the GPRS network using a packet data protocol (PDP) context activation request.<br>
SI02: The GGSN then receives the PDP context activation requests and establishes a bearer including a GPRS Tunnelling Protocol (GTP) bearer across the core network part and a Radio Access Bearer (RAB) across the Radio Network part.<br>
SI04: Either the GGSN or the UE then forms a link local address, which includes an interface ID address component. The interface ID component includes a tunnelling end identifier (TEID) which identifies the end of the GTP bearer as the bearer ends at the GGSN.<br>
S106; The UE then uses the link local address to request an IPv6 address for example from a DHCPv6 server.<br>
S108: The DHCPv6 server allocates the UE an IPv6 address and returns the IPv6 address to the UE.<br>
SI 10: The UE informs the GGSN that communication will be effected in accordance with the IPv6 internet protocol. The GGSN should therefore identify the allocated bearer from an IPv6 source address.<br>
 <br>
SI 12: The UE initiates PDF Context Modification to modify the TFT at the GGSN for the bearer to recognise an IPv6 source address of the CN. Therefore, the TFT identifies the bearer for communicating internet packet data to the UE on the basis of a source address which is an IPv6 source address,<br>
An example of a process of forming the link local address as identified in step SI04 in Figure 7 is summarised by the flow diagram of Figure 8. Figure 8 is summarised as follows:<br>
S120: The GGSN provides the UE with address data in the PCO field of a PDF context allocation. The address data includes the tunnelling end identifier and a company identifier.<br>
S122. The UE then forms an interface ID component of the link local address (GAT-I) from the tunnelling identifier and the company identifier,<br>
SI24: The UE then forms the link local address from the interface ID and an address component which indicates that the address is a local address. The address component has a first field of 10-bits with a predetermined pattern according to an internet protocol IPv6 standard and a second field of 54 bits, which are set to all zeros.<br>
S106 to S112: Processing then proceeds as shown in Figure 7.<br>
The UE can then use the IPv6 address to communicate via the allocated GTP and RAB tunnelling bearers. For up-link communications (UE to CN) the GGSN is not concerned with the internet protocol version. For down-link communications the GGSN is notified that the communications session is an IPv6 session and that therefore the internet packets received from the CN should be routed by the appropriate bearer, which is identified from me IPv6 source address of the CN.<br>
Various further aspects and features of the present invention are defined in the appended claims. Various modifications can be made to the embodiments herein described without departing from the scope of the present invention, For example, although the above embodiments have been described for a first internet protocol as IPv6 and the second internet protocol (communication via the packet radio system network) as IPv4, in other embodiments die first protocol may be IPv4 and the second protocol (for communication via the packet radio system network) may be IPv6. Furthermore other internet protocols may be used for the first and second internet protocols.<br>
 <br>
4.  Annex 1; IPv6 Addressing Schemes<br>
These addressing schemes are summarised in more detail in RFC 3513<br>
"Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Addressing Architecture".<br>
IPv6 unicast addresses are agreeable with prefixes of arbitrary bit-length similar to IPv4 addresses under Classless Routing. There are several types of unicast addresses in IPv6, in particular, global unicast, site-local unicast, and link-local unicast. There are also some special purpose subtypes of global unicast, such as IPv6 addresses with embedded IPv4 address types or encoded NSAP addresses. Additional address types or subtypes can be defined in the future.<br>
IPv6 nodes may have considerable or little knowledge of the internal structure of the IPv6 address, depending on the role of the node plays (for instance, host versus router). At a minimum, a node may consider that unicast address (including its own) have no internal structure. An example of this is shown in Figure 9. A slightly sophisticated host (but still rattier simple) may additionally be aware of subnet prefix(s) for the link(s) it is attached to, where different addresses may have different values for the subnet prefix(s) which occupies the first n bits, as shown in Figure 10. The address shown in Figure 10 can be used to construct fee IPv6 address, called the GAT address, for automatic tunnelling. The interface identifiers in IPv6 unicast addresses are used to identify interfaces on a link. They are required to be unique within a subnet prefix.<br>
Constructing Interface IP of IPv6 Address<br>
For all unicast addresses, except those that start with binary value 000 (the addresses using embedded IPv4 addresses), interface ED's are required to be 64 bits long and to be constructed in Modified EUI-64 format (IEEE, "Guidelines for 64-bit Global Identifier (EUI-64) Registration Authority" http://staxidards.ie6e.or^fegauth/oui/tutonal/EUI64.html. March 1997),<br>
Modified EUI-64 format based Interface identifiers may have global scope when derived from a global token (e.g. IEEE 802 48-bit MAC or IEEE EUI-64 identifiers) or may have local scope where a global token is npt available (e.g. serial links, tunnel end-points, etc) or where global tokens are undesirable (e.g. temporary tokens for privacy).<br>
 <br>
Modified EUI-64 format interface identifiers are formed by inverting the "u" bit (universal/local bit in IEEE EUI-64 terminology) when forming the interface identifier from EEEE EUI-64 identifiers. In the resulting Modified EUI-64 format the "u" bit is set to "1" to indicate the global scope, and it is set to "0" to indicate local scope, The first three octets in binary of an IEEE EUI-64 identifier are shown in Figure 11. As shown in Figure 11, the address has fields written in Internet standard bit-order, where "u" is the universal/local bit, "g" is the individual/group bit, and "c" are the bits of the companyjd. Examples are provided in RFC3 513.<br>
When there is no specific built-in interface identifier is available such as the serial links or the configured tunnels (they are called links without identifiers), interface identifiers must be chosen that are unique within a subnet-prefix.<br>
When no built-in identifier is available on a link the preferred approach is to use a global interface identifier from another interface or one which is assigned to the node itself.<br>
When non global interface identifier is available for use on the link, it needs to create a local-scope interface identifier.<br>
Global IPv6 Unicast Addresses<br>
An example of a gloabal IPv6 urn-cast address is shown in Figure 12.<br>
IPv6 Addresses with Embedded IPv4 Addresses<br>
To facilitate the IPv4 to IPv6 transition, a technique for hosts and routers to dynamically tunnel IPv6 packets over IPv4 routing infrastructure. IPv6 nodes that use this technique are assigned special IPv6 unicast address with an embedded global IPv4 address in the lower-order 32 bits. An example is shown in Figure 13 which can be described as an "IPv4 compatible IPv6 address".<br>
Another type of IPv4 address is called "IPv4-mapped IPv6 address" which has an address format as illustrated in Figure 14. It can be used to represent the IPv4 nodes using IPv6 addresses.<br>
Local-use IPv6 Unicast Addresses<br>
Two types of local use addresses are illustrated in Figures 15 and 16. These are a site-local address and a link-local address. Site local addresses are designed for addressing inside of a site without the need for a global prefix. The format of the site-local address is shown in Figure 15.<br>
 <br>
The link-local address is designed for addressing on a single link for automatic address configuration, neighbour discovery, or when no routers are present. The fdrmat of the site-local address is shown in Figure 16. There are other types of address such as Any-cast address, multicast address, loop-back address, etc.<br>
5.  Annex 2; IPv4 UMTS Bearer Initiation Using PPP Context Activation<br>
IP traffic (IPv6 or IPv4) is transported across the UMTS network (between UE and GGSN) across UMTS bearer, A UMTS bearer is described as the establishment of PDF (Packet Data Protocol) Context. A user equipment UE sends IPv4 or IPv6 packets across the UMTS network by setting up IPv4 PDF Context or IPv6 PDP Context, IPv6 PDP Contexts are only supported in a IPv6 capable UMTS network, specifically SGSN and GGSN as well as UE capable of supporting the IP6 related functions (routing, security) in its network protocol stack.<br>
An IPv4 only UMTS network will only support IPv4 PDP Context, although there is no explicit difference between the establishment procedures for IPv4 PDP Context and IPv6 PDP Context. Address management and security within a PDP Context activation are highlighted in the following summary with reference to a flow diagram in Figure 17. The flow diagram of Figure 17 represents equivalently IPv4 for IPv4 PDP Context and IPv6 for IPv6 PDP Context for an IPv6 capable UMTS.<br>
S90: The user equipment UE sends an activate PDP Context Request (NSAPI, TI, PDP Type, PDP Address, Access Point Name, QoS Requested, PDP Configuration Options) message to the SGSN. The user equipment UE uses a PDP address to indicate whether it requires the use of a static PDP address or whether it requires the use of a dynamic PDP address. The user equipment UE leaves PDP address empty to request a dynamic PDP address.<br>
S92: The SGSN validates the Activate PDP Context Request using PDP Type (optional), PDP Address (optional), and Access Point Name (optional) provided by the user equipment UE and the PDP context subscription records.<br>
If no GGSN address can be derived or if the SGSN has determined that the Activate PDP Context Request is not valid according to the rules, the SGSN rejects the PDP context activation request.<br>
If a GGSN address can be derived, the SGSN creates a TEID for the requested PDP context. If the user equipment UE requests a dynamic address, the SGSN lets a GGSN allocate the dynamic address. The SGSN may restrict the requested QoS attributes given its capabilities and the current load, and it shall restrict the requested QoS attributes according to the subscribed QoS profile.<br>
The SGSN sends a Create PDF Context Request (PDF Type, PDF Address, Access Point Name, QoS Negotiated, TEJD, NSAFJ, MSISDN, Selection Mode, Charging Characteristics, Trace Reference, Trace Type, Trigger Id, OMC Identity, PDF Configuration Options) message to the affected GGSN... PDF Address shall be empty if a dynamic address is requested.<br>
S94: The GGSN creates a new entry in its PDF context table and generates a Charging Id. The new entry allows the GGSN to route PDF PDUs between the SGSN and the external PDF network, and to start charging. The way the GGSN handles Charging Characteristics that it may have received from the SGSN is defined in 3G TS 32.015 [4], The GGSN then returns a Create PDF Context Response (TEID, PDF Address, PDF Configuration Options, QoS Negotiated, Charging Id, and Cause) message to the SGSN. PDF Address is included if the GGSN allocated a PDF address. If the GGSN has been configured by the operator to use External PDN Address Allocation for the requested APN, PDF Address shall be set to 0.0.0.0, indicating that the PDF address shall be negotiated by the user equipment UE with the external PDN after completion of the POP Context Activation procedure. The GGSN shall relay, modify and monitor these negotiations as long as the PDF context is in ACTIVE state, and use the GGSN-Initiated PDF Context Modification procedure to transfer the currently used PDF address to the SGSN and the user equipment UE. PDF Configuration Options contain optional PDF parameters that the GGSN may transfer to the user equipment UE, These optional PDF parameters may be requested by the user equipment UE in the Activate PDF Context Request message, or may be sent unsolicited by the GGSN. PDF Configuration Options is sent transparently through the SGSN. The Create PDF Context messages are sent over the backbone network.<br>
S 96: A radio access bearer is set-up in accordance with the PDF activation, including QoS negotiation. The PDF context request is then updated (S97) from the SGSN to the GGSN and the GGSN responds to the update (S98).<br>
S 99: If the user equipment UE has requested a dynamic address, the PDF address received from the GGSN is inserted in the PDF context. The SGSN selects Radio Priority and Packet Flow Id based on QoS Negotiated, and returns an Activate PDF Context Accept (PDF Type, PDF Address, TI, QoS Negotiated, Radio Priority, Packet Flow Id, PDF Configuration Options) message to the user equipment UE. The<br>
 <br>
SGSN is now able to route PDP PDUs between the GGSN and the user equipment UE, and to start charging. NSAPI (together with TI) is used to distinguish secondary PDP Contexts.<br>
