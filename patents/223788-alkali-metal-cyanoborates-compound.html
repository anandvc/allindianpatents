				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of alkali metal<br>
cyanoborates, to the further conversion thereof into salts comprising cyanoborate<br>
anions and organic cations, to these salts, and to the use thereof as ionic liquids.<br>
Ionic liquids or liquid salts are ionic species which consist of an organic cation and<br>
a generally inorganic anion. They do not contain neutral molecules, and generally<br>
have melting points below 373 K. A multiplicity of compounds which are used as<br>
ionic liquids are known in the prior art. In particular, they are also the subject-mat-<br>
ter of a series of patents and patent applications.<br>
Thus, solvent-free ionic liquids were disclosed for the first time by Hurley and Wier<br>
in a series of US patents (US 2,446,331, US 2,446,339 and US 2,446,350). These<br>
"salts which are molten at room temperature" comprised AICI3 and a multiplicity of<br>
n-alkylpyridinium halides.<br>
In recent years, some review articles have been published on this topic<br>
(R. Sheldon "Catalytic reactions in ionic liquids", Chem. Commun., 2001, 2399-<br>
2407; M.J. Earle, K.R. Seddon "Ionic liquids. Green solvent for the future", Pure<br>
Appl. Chem., 72 (2000), 1391-1398; P. Wasserscheid, W. Keim "lonische Flussig-<br>
keiten - neue Losungen fur die Ubergangsmetallkatalyse" [Ionic Liquids - Novel'<br>
Solutions for Transition-Metal Catalysis], Angew. Chem., 112 (2000), 3926-3945;<br>
T. Welton "Room temperature ionic liquids. Solvents for synthesis and catalysis",<br>
Chem. Rev., 92 (1999), 2071-2083; R. Hagiwara, Ya. Ito "Room temperature ionic<br>
liquids of alkylimidazolium cations and fluoroanions", Journal of Fluorine Chem.,<br>
105(2000), 221-227).<br>
The properties of ionic liquids, for example melting point, thermal and electro-<br>
chemical stability, viscosity, are greatly influenced by the nature of the anion. By<br>
contrast, the polarity and hydrophilicity or lipophilicity can be varied through a suit-<br>
able choice of the cation/anion pair. There is therefore a basic demand for novel<br>
ionic liquids having varied properties which facilitate additional possibilities with<br>
respect to their use.<br>
Crucial advances in the area of ionic liquids have been achieved with the discov-<br>
ery of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloroaluminate. This salt has a broad liquid<br>
range and an electrochemical window of greater than 3 V and is thus of great<br>
interest for electrochemical and synthetic purposes. However, its use is limited by<br>
the chemical instability, especially to moisture. After the discovery of the more<br>
hydrolysis-stable 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate, combinations of<br>
alkylimidazolium cations with inorganic or organic anions were investigated, of<br>
which 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate is the best characterised.<br>
The stability of the imidazolium cation is relatively high and its decomposition tem-<br>
perature is essentially determined by the anion. Thus, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium<br>
salts with triflate and bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide anions are stable up to<br>
400°C, whereas 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate is only stable up to<br>
300°C.<br>
The prior art describes borate anions in which fluorine ligands have been replaced<br>
by cyanide (E. Bernhardt, G. Henkel, H. Willner, Z. Anorg. Allg. Chem. 626 (2000)<br>
560; D. Williams, B. Pleune, J. Kouvetakis, M. D. Williams, R. A. Andersen, J.<br>
Amer. Chem. Soc. 122 (2000) 7735; E. Bernhardt, M. Berkei, M. Schürmann, H.<br>
Willner, Z. Anorg. Allg. Chem. 628 (2002) 1734) and trifluoromethyl ligands (E.<br>
Bernhardt, G. Henkel, H. Willner, G. Pawelke, H. Burger, Chem. Eur. J. 7 (2001)<br>
4696; G. Pawelke, H. Burger, Coord. Chem. Rev. 215 (2001) 243). The trifluoro-<br>
methyl borates are synthesised here starting from the cyanoborates, but the<br>
cyanoborates are only accessible with difficulty and in small amounts. The synthe-<br>
sis of [B(CN4)]-is labour-intensive and can only be carried out on a small prepara-<br>
tive scale. In addition, the starting materials are expensive.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide novel stable compounds having<br>
valuable properties which can be used as ionic liquids, and a process for the<br>
preparation thereof. In particular, the object is to provide salts with borate anions<br>
which have higher stability than the salts with tetrafluoroborate anions.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide an effective and economical<br>
process for the preparation of these borate salts and their precursors.<br>
This object is achieved in accordance with the invention by the characterising<br>
features of the main claim and the sub-claims.<br>
The present invention therefore relates firstly to a process for the preparation of<br>
alkali metal cyanoborates of the general formula (1)<br>
M+ [B(CN)4]- (1),<br>
where M is selected from the group Li, Na, K, Rb and Cs,<br>
in which the readily available starting substances alkali metal tetrafluoroborate<br>
M[BF4] (M = Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs) and alkali metal cyanide MCN (M = Li, Na, K, Rb,<br>
Cs) are reacted with one another in a solid-state reaction.<br>
The alkali metal tetrafluoroborate used in accordance with the invention is prefera-<br>
bly potassium tetrafluoroborate K[BF4] or sodium tetrafluoroborate Na[BF4], and<br>
the alkali metal cyanide used in accordance with the invention is preferably potas-<br>
sium cyanide KCN or sodium cyanide NaCN.<br>
In a preferred variant of the process according to the invention, the alkali metal<br>
tetrafluoroborate is reacted with the alkali metal cyanide in the presence of a lith-<br>
ium halide. The lithium halide here is selected from LiCI, LiBr and Lil, it is particu-<br>
larly preferably lithium chloride LiCI.<br>
Alkali metal cyanide and lithium halide can in each case be employed in an excess<br>
of one of the two reagents. However, the alkali metal cyanide and the lithium hal-<br>
ide are preferably brought to reaction in approximately in the molar ratio 1:1.<br>
The alkali metal tetrafluoroborate and the alkali metal cyanide are preferably<br>
employed in the molar ratio of 1:4 to 1:12, particularly preferably in the molar ratio _<br>
of about 1:9.<br>
The alkali metal tetrafluoroborate : alkali metal cyanide : lithium halide molar ratio<br>
of about 1:9:9 is therefore very particularly preferably used.<br>
The starting materials used for the reaction according to the invention are particu-<br>
larly preferably potassium tetrafluoroborate K[BF4] as alkali metal tetrafluoroborate<br>
and potassium cyanide KCN as alkali metal cyanide.<br>
The solid-state reaction according to the invention is carried out at temperatures<br>
between 100°C and 500°C. Preference is given to temperatures of 250 to 400°C,<br>
particularly preferably 280 - 340°C.<br>
Without restricting generality, the subject-matter of the solid-state reaction<br>
according to the invention is explained with reference to a general example:<br>
K[BF4], KCN and LiCI are mixed in the molar ratio of 1:9:9 and subsequently<br>
brought to reaction in the melt. The reaction temperature is selected in such a way<br>
that on the one hand the KCN/LiCI mixture forms a eutectic melting at 270 - 290°C<br>
and on the other hand the tetracyanoborate salts formed only decompose slowly<br>
(
with LiCI (molar ratio 1:1) enables mixed crystals of the K(CI,CN) type (a = 6.34 A,<br>
F m3m) and a further unidentified compound (d = 4.958, 2.878, 2.728, 2.482,<br>
2.175 A) to be detected. The yield of K[B(CN)4] is virtually temperature-independ-<br>
ent in the range 280 - 340°C and is about 40 - 60%, based on K[BF4]. It is found<br>
in further experiments that a reduction in the molar ratio of K[BF4] to KCN/LiCI from<br>
1:9 to 1:4.5 results in reductions in yield. The Raman spectra of the reaction mix-<br>
tures show that the tetracyanoborate is in the form of the lithium salt after the<br>
reaction (v<cn cm></cn>
In the analogous reaction using an NaCN/LiCI mixture, mixed crystals of the<br>
(Li,Na)(CI,CN) type (a = 5.50A Fm3m) form in the melt of NaCN with LiCI (molar<br>
ratio 1:1) besides a little LiCN (d= 5.216, 3.626 A, m.p. 160°C). A eutectic<br>
(120-140°C) forms between NaCN with LiCI, in contrast to KCN/LiCI, but the mixed<br>
crystals only melt at 360 - 540°C; this is probably the cause of the lower yields<br>
(about 25%) of Na[B(CN)4].<br>
During work-up of the reaction products, the excess cyanide must firstly be des-<br>
troyed. It is found that oxidation of the cyanide using aqueous 30% H2O2 solution<br>
is the best work-up method. The low salt burden and the complete and rapid<br>
degradation of the cyanide remaining in the reaction mixture, as well as the good<br>
yields outweigh the single disadvantage, the often vigorous and difficult-to-control<br>
reaction of the cyanide. The tetracyanoborate is subsequently extracted from the<br>
aqueous solution and converted into the K or Na salt by re-extraction.<br>
An alternative method available for the work-up of the solid-state reaction products<br>
is oxidation of the unreacted cyanide using aqueous NaOCI solution, which pro-<br>
ceeds within a few minutes under very mild conditions, i.e. without warming or<br>
foaming of the reaction mixture. The work-up is then carried out analogously to<br>
that with H2O2. However, this further work-up is more labour-intensive and time-<br>
consuming owing to the greater salt burden.<br>
The present invention furthermore relates to a process for the preparation of alkali<br>
metal cyanoborates of the general formula (2)<br>
M+ [BFn(CN)4-n]- (2),<br>
where n = 0, 1,2 or 3 and<br>
M is selected from the group Li, Na, K, Rb and Cs,<br>
in which an alkali metal cyanide MCN, where M = Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, is reacted with<br>
boron trifluoride etherate BF3OEt2.<br>
On use of coarse-grained potassium cyanide KCN and BF3OEt2, equimolar<br>
amounts of K[BF4] and K[BF2(CN)2] also form in the reaction according to the<br>
invention alongside the primary adduct K[BF3(CN)], in accordance with the follow-<br>
ing equations:<br>
k[bF3(CN)] + BF3OEt2 = k[bF4] + BF2(CN)OEt2<br>
BF2(CN)-OEt2 + KCN? k[bF2(CN)2] + Et2O<br>
In addition, the two salts K[BF(CN)3] and K[B(CN)4] form to a lesser extent, the<br>
former in particular if the reaction mixture is held at temperatures above room<br>
temperature.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the boron trifluoride etherate is reacted with the<br>
alkali metal cyanide in the presence of an aprotic solvent. Without restricting gen-<br>
erality, the aprotic solvent can be, for example, acetonitrile, diethyl ether, tetra-<br>
hydrofuran and/or dimethoxyethane.<br>
The alkali metal cyanide used for the process according to the invention is pref-<br>
erably potassium cyanide KCN.<br>
The starting materials are preferably reacted in accordance with the invention at<br>
temperatures of -80 to 100°C, particularly preferably at room temperature.<br>
Volatile by-products which are removed under reduced pressure may be formed<br>
during the reaction. Mostly, however, by-products which are insoluble in the sol-<br>
vents used and are separated off by filtration form. The solvent is, if desired,<br>
removed under reduced pressure together with volatile by-products, and the alkali<br>
metal cyanoborates obtained can, if desired, be separated and purified by a com-<br>
mon possibility known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
A third and fourth subject-matter of the present invention are a process for the<br>
preparation of salts with cyanoborate anions of the general formula (3) and the<br>
corresponding salts of the general formula (3)<br>
Kt+ [BFn(CN)4-n] - (3),<br>
where n = 0,1, 2 or 3, and Kt+ is an organic cation, with the proviso that the cation<br>
Kt+ is not [N(C4H9)4r for n=0.<br>
For the preparation of the salts, an alkali metal cyanoborate of the general formula<br>
M+ [B(CN)4]-, where M is selected from the group Li, Na, K, Rb and Cs, or an<br>
alkali metal cyanoborate of the general formula M+ [BFn(CN)4-n]-, where n = 0,1,2<br>
or 3 and M is selected from the group Li, Na, K, Rb and Cs, is reacted with Kt+ X",<br>
where X is a halogen selected from Cl, Br and I, and Kt+ is an organic cation, with<br>
the proviso that the cation Kt+ is not [N(C4H9)4]+ for n=0.<br>
The organic cation Kt+ is preferably selected from the group<br>
where R = H, with the proviso that at least one R on the hetero atom is<br>
different from H,<br>
straight-chain or branched alkyl having 1-20 carbon atoms<br>
straight-chain or branched alkenyl having 2-20 carbon atoms<br>
and one or more double bonds<br>
straight-chain or branched alkynyl having 2-20 carbon atoms<br>
and one or more triple bonds<br>
saturated, partially or fully unsaturated cycloalkyl having 3-7<br>
carbon atoms<br>
halogen, in particular fluorine or chlorine, with the proviso that<br>
no halogen-hetero atom bond is present,<br>
-NO2, with the proviso that no bond to a positively charged<br>
hetero atom is present, and at least one R is different from<br>
NO2,<br>
-CN, with the proviso that no bond to a positively charged<br>
hetero atom is present, and at least one R is different from<br>
CN,<br>
where the R are in each case identical or different,<br>
where the R may be bonded to one another in pairs by single or<br>
double bond,<br>
where one or more R may be partially or fully substituted by<br>
halogens, in particular -F and/or -Cl, or partially by -CN or -NO2,<br>
with the proviso that not all R are fully halogenated,<br>
and where one-or two carbon atoms of the R may be replaced<br>
by hetero atoms and/or atom groups selected from the group<br>
-O-, -C(Oh C(O)O-, -S-, -S(O)-, -SO2-, -S(O)2O-, -N=, -P=,<br>
-NR'-, -PR'-, -P(O)(OR&gt;, -P(O)(OR')O-, -PfOXNR'R1)-,<br>
-P(O)(NR'R')O-, -PfOXNR'R'JNR'-, -S(O)NR'- and -S(O)2NR'-,<br>
where R' = H, non-, partially or perfluorinated C1-to C6-alkyl or<br>
non-, partially or perfluorinated phenyl.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, fully unsaturated substituents are also<br>
taken to mean aromatic substituents.<br>
Besides hydrogen, suitable substituents R of the organic cation in accordance with<br>
the invention are: C1- to C20-. in particular C1- to C12-alkyl groups, C2- to C20-, in<br>
particular C2- to C12-, alkenyl or alkynyl groups, saturated or unsaturated, i.e. also<br>
aromatic, C3- to C7-cycloalkyl groups, NO2, CN or halogens. However, a restricting<br>
factor for the halogens here is that they only occur as substituents on carbon<br>
atoms, but not on hetero atoms. NO2 and CN do not occur as substituents of a<br>
positively charged hetero atom; furthermore, not all substituents simultaneously<br>
have the meaning of NO2 or CN.<br>
The substituents R may also be bonded in pairs in such a way that cyclic, bi- or<br>
polycyclic cations are formed. The substituents may be partially or fully substituted<br>
by halogen atoms, in particular by F and/or Cl, or partially by CN or NO2 and con-<br>
tain one or two hetero atoms or atom groups, selected from the group O, (O),<br>
C(O)O, S, S(O), SO2, SO2O, N, P, NH, PH, NR', PR', P(O)(OR'), P(O)(OR')O,<br>
PCOXNR'R'), P(O)(NR'R')O, P(O)(NR'R')NR', S(O)NR' and S(O)2NR'. In the case<br>
of complete halogenation, however, not all substituents R present may be fully<br>
halogenated, i.e. at least one R is not perhalogenated.<br>
Without restricting generality, examples of substituents according to the invention<br>
of the organic cation are:<br>
-F, -Cl, -Br, -I, -CH3) -C2H5, -C3H7, -CH(CH3)2. -C4H9, -C(CH3)3, -C5H11, -C6H13,<br>

Without restricting generality, the following organic cations are particularly pre-<br>
ferred as salts according to the invention:<br>
The salts according to the invention are advantageously very readily soluble in<br>
organic solvents. In comparison to known liquid salts, the salts according to the<br>
invention surprisingly have low viscosity. The salts according to the invention are<br>
advantageously stable. They can be isolated and stored at room temperature.<br>
Furthermore, the salts according to the invention are relatively easy to prepare,<br>
and readily available starting materials are required.<br>
All compounds according to the invention and compounds of the formula<br>
[N(C4Hg)4]+ [B(CN)4]- have a salt-like character, relatively low melting points (usu-<br>
ally below 100°C) and can be used as ionic liquids.<br>
The salts according to the invention and salts of the formula [N(C4H9)4]+ [B(CN)4]-<br>
can be employed as solvents for many synthetic or catalytic reactions, for example<br>
Friedel-Crafts acylation and alkylation, Diels-Alder cycloadditions, hydrogenation<br>
and oxidation reactions, Heck reactions. Furthermore, for example, fluorinated sol-<br>
vents for secondary and primary batteries can be synthesised.<br>
The salts according to the invention and salts of the formula [N(C4Hg)4]+ [B(CN)4]-<br>
are suitable as precursors for the preparation of liquid-crystal compounds and of<br>
active ingredients, inter alia for medicaments and crop-protection agents.<br>
It is also possible to use the compounds according to the invention and the salts of<br>
the formula [N(C4H9)4]+ [B(CN)4]- as non-aqueous electrolyte, optionally in combi-<br>
nation with other electrolytes known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
In addition, the salts according to the invention and salts of the formula [N(C4H9)4]+<br>
[B(CN)4]- are of interest as non-aqueous, polar substances in suitable reactions as<br>
phase-transfer catalyst or as medium for the heterogenisation of homogeneous<br>
catalysts.<br>
The complete disclosure content of all applications, patents and publications men-<br>
tioned above and below are incorporated into this application by way of reference.<br>
Even without further comments, it is assumed that a person skilled in the art will be<br>
able to utilise the above description in the broadest scope. The preferred embodi-<br>
ments and examples should therefore merely be regarded as descriptive disclo-<br>
sure which is absolutely not limiting in any way.<br>

DSC measurements were carried out in a Netzsch DSC 204 instrument. The tem-<br>
perature and sensitivity were calibrated using naphthalene, benzoic acid, KNO3,<br>
AgNO3, LiNO3 and CsCI. In each case, 5-20 mg of the substances were weighed<br>
out into an aluminium crucible and sealed with aluminium caps with a small aper-<br>
ture. The investigation was carried out in the temperature range from 25 to 500°C.<br>
Unless indicated otherwise, the heating rate is 10 Kmin-1. During the measure-<br>
merit, the sample space was flushed with dry nitrogen. The samples of air-sensi-<br>
tive substances were prepared in a dry box and transported to the analytical<br>
instrument in an argon-filled vial. The data evaluation was carried out using the<br>
Netzsch Protens 4.0 program.<br>
The elemental analyses were carried out by the microanalysis combustion meth-<br>
ods using a Euro EA3000 from HEKA-Tech GmbH. The samples of air-sensitive<br>
substances were prepared in a dry box and transported to the analytical instru-<br>
ment in an argon-filled vial. The error limits for the recorded atoms are: C: ±0.3%,<br>
H: ±0.1%, N: ±0.2%.<br>
Example 1: Synthesis of K[B(CN)4]<br>
KCN, LiCI and K[BF4] are ground coarsely and mixed with one another in a mortar<br>
in a dry box (MBraun, Munich). The mixture is finely ground using a commercially<br>
available coffee grinder. The reaction mixture is subsequently transferred into a<br>
nickel crucible (Øintemal = 101 mm, dwall = 2 mm, h = 85 mm). The crucible is cov-<br>
ered loosely by an iron lid, transferred from the dry box into a muffle furnace (VMK<br>
93, Kontron Material und Strukturanalyse GmbH) and heated. When the reaction<br>
is complete, the crucible with the metal cover is removed from the still-hot muffle<br>
furnace and cooled to room temperature in air.<br>
The cooled grey/black porous reaction mixture is transferred out of the crucible<br>
into a mortar and crushed coarsely. 150 ml of water are subsequently added to the<br>
comminuted solid in a 3 I beaker, and a total of 350 ml of H2O2 (30% aqueous<br>
solution, about 3 mol) are added in approximately 30 mi portions over a period of<br>
half an hour with constant stirring. The reaction, which commences exothermically<br>
with vigorous evolution of gas, is controlled by addition of ice. The reaction mixture<br>
(V = 2.31) is divided between two 3 I beakers and acidified using concentrated HCf<br>
(about 300 ml, about 3.6 mol) (pH 5-7) until gas evolution is no longer observed.<br>
It is subsequently checked whether cyanide residues are still present in the mix-<br>
ture (cyanide test, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). The mixture is then fil-<br>
tered, and 28 ml (0.34 mol) of cone. HCI are added to the yellow solution with stir-<br>
ring. 47 g (63 ml, 0.33 mol) of tripropylamine are subsequently added. The reac-<br>
tion mixture is stirred for 15 minutes and extracted with dichloromethane (250, 150<br>
and 50 ml). The combined organic phases are washed with 200 ml of H2O, and<br>
the washings are re-extracted with 25 ml of dichloromethane. The combined di-<br>
chloromethane phases are dried over MgSO4 and filtered through a glass frit (D4).<br>
35 g (0.63 mol) of KOH are dissolved in a little water and added to the organic<br>
solution with vigorous stirring. A beige oily substance immediately precipitates out<br>
and forms lumps on the vessel base after further stirring (30 min). The dichloro-<br>
methane/tripropylamine mixture is decanted off, and the product is extracted from<br>
the residue with THF (200, 100 and 50 ml). The collected THF phases are dried<br>
using K2CO3, and finally all volatile constituents are removed in a rotary evapora-<br>
tor. The white product is washed with dichloromethane and dried at room tem-<br>
perature under reduced pressure.<br>

According to DSC measurements, the salt decomposes above 450°C.<br>
Example 2: Synthesis of Na[B(CN)4]<br>
170.3 g (2.62 mol) of KCN, 116.1 g (2.74 mol) of LiCI and 37.2 g (0.30 mol) of<br>
K[BF4] are weighed out, ground coarsely in a mortar and mixed with one another.<br>
The further procedure corresponds to that described under Example 1 (reaction<br>
temperature 300°C, reaction time 1.5 hours) as far as the obtaining of the<br>
dichloromethane extract.<br>
2 equivalents of NaOH (about 25 g, 0.63 mol) are dissolved in as little water as<br>
possible (about 10-20 ml) and added dropwise to the organic solution with vigor-<br>
ous stirring. A beige oily substance immediately precipitates out and forms lumps<br>
on the vessel base after further stirring (at least 30 min). The dichloromethane/<br>
tripropylamine mixture is decanted off, and the product is extracted from the resi-<br>
due with THF (200 ml, 100 ml and 50 ml). If the beige residue becomes liquid due<br>
to the extraction, its viscous consistency can be restored by careful addition of<br>
Na2CO3 or Na2SO4.<br>
The collected THF phases are dried using Na2CO3 or Na2SO4, and finally all vola-<br>
tile constituents are removed in a rotary evaporator. The white product is washed<br>
with dichloromethane in order to remove amine residues and dried at 60°C under<br>
reduced pressure. Yield 25.3 g (62%, 0.18 mol).<br>

5 g (32 mmol) of K[B(CN)4] are dissolved in 20 ml of water and reacted with 8 ml of<br>
37% hydrochloric acid (96 mmol) and 8 ml of Pr3N (42 mmol). This mixture is then<br>
extracted twice with 50 ml of CH2CI2 each time, the organic phase is dried using<br>
MgSO4, and a solution of 3 g of UOHH2O (72 mmol) in 20 ml of water is added,<br>
and the mixture is stirred vigorously for one hour. All volatile products are removed<br>
under reduced pressure. Li[B(CN)4] is extracted from the residue with 50 ml of<br>
CH3CN in a Soxlett apparatus. The organic phase is evaporated in a rotary evapo-<br>
rator. The crude product is recrystallised from water, washed with 50 ml of CH2CI2<br>

drous acetonitrile are brought to reaction in a 250 ml glass flask with PTFE valve<br>
(Young, London). The acetonitrile is removed under reduced pressure after 4 hrs,<br>
and 100 ml of dichloromethane are subsequently added. The suspension is filtered<br>
through a Celite®-covered frit in a Schlenk flask. The reaction flask is rinsed twice<br>
with dichloromethane (20 ml and 10 ml). The solution is evaporated to 10 ml under<br>
reduced pressure, and, after addition of 70 ml of anhydrous hexane, an orange<br>
solid precipitates out. This is filtered off via a Schlenk frit and rinsed with a further<br>
10 ml of hexane. The orange [Ph3C][B(CN)4] is dried under reduced pressure and<br>
stored in a dry box. The yield is 408 mg (51%, 1.3 mmol).<br>

BF3OEt2 are added dropwise over the course of half an hour with stirring at room<br>
temperature. During the addition, the temperature rises to 50°C. After further stir-<br>
ring (1.5 h) at room temperature, the solution is filtered off, and the filter residue<br>
