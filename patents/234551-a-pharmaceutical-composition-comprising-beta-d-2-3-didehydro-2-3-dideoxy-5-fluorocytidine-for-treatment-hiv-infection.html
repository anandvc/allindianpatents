				<td>HIV-1 MUTATIONS SELECTED FOR BY -2'3-DIDEHYDRO-2'3'-DIDEOXY-5-FLUOROCYTIDINE<br>
This invention is partially funded by a grant from the United States National Institutes of Health under Grant No. 1R01-A 1-41980-01. The U.S. government has certain rights to this invention.<br>
This application claims priority to U.S. provisional patent application no. 60/116,773, filed on January 22, 1999.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In 1983, the etiological cause of AIDS was determined to be the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In 1985, it was reported that the synthetic nucleoside 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) inhibits the replication of human immunodeficiency virus. Since then, a number of other synthetic nucleosides, including 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (DDI), 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (DDC), 2',3'-dideoxy-2',3'-didehydrothvmidine (D4T), cis-2-hydroxymethyl-5-(5-fluorocytosin-1 -yl)-1,3-oxathiolane (FTC), (-)-cis-2-hydroxymethyl-5-(cytosin-l-yl)-l,3-oxathiolane (3TC), have been proven to be effective against HIV. After cellular phosphorylation to the 5'-triphosphate by cellular kinases, these synthetic nucleosides are incorporated into a growing strand of viral DNA, causing chain termination due to the absence of the 3'-hydroxyl group. They can also inhibit the viral enzyme reverse transcriptase.<br>
It has been recognized that drug-resistant variants of HIV can emerge after prolonged treatment with an antiviral agent. Drug resistance most typically occurs by mutation of a gene that encodes for an enzyme used in viral replication, and most typically in the case of HIV, reverse transcriptase, protease, or DNA polymerase. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the efficacy of a drug against HIV infection can be prolonged, augmented, or restore^' by administering the compound in combination or alternation with a second, and perhaps third, antiviral compound that induces a different mutation from that caused by the principle drug. Alternatively, the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, or other parameter of the drug can be altered by such combination or alternation therapy. In general, combination therapy is typically preferred over alternation therapy because it induces multiple<br>
simultaneous pressures on the virus. One cannot predict, however, what mutations will be induced in the HIV-1 genome by a given drug, whether the mutation is permanent or transient, or how an infected cell with a mutated HIV-1 sequence will respond to therapy with other agents in combination or alternation. This is exacerbated by the fact that there is a paucity of data on the kinetics of drug resistance in long-term cell cultures treated with modern antiretroviral agents.<br>
HIV-1 variants resistant to 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT), 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (DDI) or 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (DDC) have been isolated from patients receiving long term monotherapy with these drugs (Larder BA, Darby G, Richman DD. Science 1989;243:1731-4; St Clair MH, Martin , Tudor WG, et al. Science 1991 ;253:1557-9; St Clair MH, Martin JL, Tudor WG, et al. Science 1991;253:1557-9; and Fitzgibbon JE, Howell RM, Haberzettl CA, Sperber SJ, Gocke DJ, Dubin DT. Antimicrob Agents Chemother 1992;36:153-7). Mounting clinical evidence indicates that AT resistance is a predictor of poor clinical outcome in both children and adults (Mayers DL. Lecture at the Thirty-second Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy. (Anaheim, CA. 1992); Tudor-Williams G, St Clair MH, McKinney RE, et al. Lancet 1992;339:15-9; Ogino MT, Dankner WM, Spector SA. JPediatr 1993;123:l-8; Crumpacker CS, D'Aquila RT, Johnson VA, et al Third Workshop on Viral Resistance. (Gaithersburg, MD. 1993); and Mayers D, and the RV43 Study Group. Third Workshop on Viral Resistance. (Gaithersburg, MD. 1993). The rapid development of HIV-1 resistance to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) has also been reported both in cell culture and in human clinical trials (Nunberg JH, Schleif WA, Boots EJ, et al. J Virol 1991;65(9):4887-92; Richman D, Shih CK, Lowy I, et al Proc Natl AcadSci (USA) 1991 ;88 :11241 -5; Mellors JW, Dutschman GE, Im GJ, Tramontane E, Winkler SR, Cheng YC. Mol Pharm 1992;41:446-51; Richman DD and the ACTG 164/168 Study Team. Second International HIV-1 Drug Resistance Workshop. (Noordwijk, the Netherlands. 1993); and Saag MS, Emini EA, Laskin OL, et al N EnglJ Med 1993 ;329:1065-1072). In the case of the NNRTI L'697,661, drug-resistant HIV-1 emerged within 2-6 weeks of initiating therapy in association with the return of viremia to pretreatment levels (Saag MS, Emini EA, Laskin OL, et al. N EnglJ Med 1993;329:1065-1072). Breakthrough viremia associated with the appearance of drug-resistant strains has also been noted with other classes of HIV-1 inhibitors, including protease inhibitors (Jacobsen H, Craig CJ, Duncan IB, Haenggi M,<br>
Yasargil KL, Mous. Third Workshop on Viral Resistance. (Gaithersburg, MD. 1993)). This experience has led to the realization that the potential for HIV-1 drug resistance must be assessed early on in the preclinical evaluation of all new therapies for HIV-1.<br>

It is another object of the present invention to provide a method and kit to assess how to best administer P-D-D4FC.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has been discovered that J3-D-D4FC induces mutations in HIV-1 at the 70(K to N), 90 and the 172 codons of the reverse transcriptase region of the virus. Based on this discovery, a method for treating HIV is provided that includes administering P-D-D4FC or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug to a human in need of therapy in combination or alternation with a drug that induces a mutation in HIV-1 at a location other than the 70(K to N), 90 or the 172 codons of the reverse transcriptase region. This invention can be practiced by referring to published mutation patterns for known anti-HIV drugs, or by determining the mutation pattern for a new drug.<br>
Based on this discovery, a method for using (J-D-D4FC as "salvage therapy" to patients which exhibit drug resistance to other anti-HIV agents is also provided. It has been discovered that P-D-D4FC is not significantly cross-resistant to AZT, DDC, DDI, D4T, 3TC, (-)-FTC or 0-L-D4FC. In contrast, 0-L-D4FC rapidly induces a mutation at codon 184 (methionine to valine), resulting in a high level of resistance to 3TC and FTC. P-D-D4FC can be used generally as salvage therapy for any patient which exhibits resistance to a drug that induces a mutation at other than the 70(K to N), 90 or the 172 codons.<br>

II.       MutatioDs in HIV-1 Reverse Transcriptase Selected for by 0-D-D4FC<br>
Both the D- and L-enantiomers of B-2',3'-didehydro-2',3'-dideoxy-5-fluorocytidine (D4FC) are potent and selective inhibitors of HIV-1, although the D« enantiomer is more selective. The in vitro development of resistance to D-D4FC was assessed by serial passage of HIV- in MT-2 cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in the presence of increasing concentrations of drug. Variants resistant to D-D4FC arose only after prolonged exposure to the drug. Virus obtained after 20 passages in MT-2 cells exhibited 5.3-fold resistance to D-D4FC. Resistant virus could not be isolated in PBMC despite multiple attempts. DNA sequencing of RT from virus selected in MT-2 cells revealed two mutations: K65R and VI79D. The selection of D-D4FC resistant virus was repeated in MT-2 cells and variants exhibiting 19.3-fold resistance encoded three novel RT mutations: K70N, V90I and R172K. A K65R recombinant HIV-1  virus exhibited 3.9-fold resistance to D-D4FC. V179D, a mutation conferring resistance to nonnucleoside RT inhibitors, is most likely compensatory for K65R. The role of the other mutations in resistance to D-D4FC was also evaluated by construction of recombinant virus with single and multiple mutations, however, none of the recombinants tested demonstrated &gt;2-fold resistance.<br>
Materials and Methods<br>
Chemicals. D-D4FC was synthesized in one of our laboratories as described previously (Shi et al, 1999). It was prepared as 10 mM stock solutions in sterile water and stored at -20°C. The compound was thawed and diluted to the desired concentration immediately before use.<br>
Cells. MT-2 cells (AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, contributed by D. Richman) were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Whittaker M.A., Byproducts, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mM HEPES buffer, penicillin (50 Ill/ml) and streptomycin (50 g/ml).<br>
Viruses. HIV-1 LAI, a molecularly cloned clinical isolate, was used both as the starting virus for the resistance selection as well as for the generation of recombinant mutants. Stock preparations of HIV- were prepared by electrophorating 5-10 jig of proviral plasmid DNA into 1.3 x 107 MT-2 cells. At peak viral cytopathic effect (generally 7 days post transfection), the supernatant from infected cultures was collected, aliquoted and<br>
stored at -80°C until use. Virus preparations were titered by threefold endpoint dilution in MT-2 cells, and the TCIDso was calculated with the Reed and Muench equation.<br>
Selection of resistant virus. Prior to starting the selection of D-D4FC resistant virus, the starting virus (HIV-l^i) was passaged as cell-free virus for 10 cycles in MT-2 cells in the absence of drug. D-D4FC resistant virus was selected by serially passaging HIV-1 LAI in MT-2 cells in the presence of gradually increasing concentrations of D-D4FC. The selection for D-D4FC resistant virus was conducted twice. Selection was initiated by inoculating 1 x 106 MT-2 cells with 0.01 mol of virus. At peak viral cytopathic effect (4-7 days post infection), supernatant from the infected cultures was collected and 0.1-0.3 ml were subsequently used to initiate another cycle of infection. Supernatant was also aliquoted and stored at -80°C for characterization of selected virus. Virus was passaged at least three times at each concentration, the number of cycles at any given concentration of drug being dependent on the ability of virus to grow at the particular concentration of D-D4FC. During the first selection procedure, virus was passaged once in the absence of drug prior to increasing the drug concentration (Table 2). As a control, virus was also passaged in parallel in the absence of drug. The first selection was initiated at 0.75 uM and gradually increased to 4.0 fiM during the course of 37 cycles of cell-free passage. The second selection was initiated at 0.2 jaM and gradually increased to 6.2 uM during the course of 27 cycles of cell-free passage <br>

Antiviral susceptibility assays. Virus susceptibility to D-D4FC was measured by measuring percent inhibition of p24 antigen production. Briefly, MT-2 cells (1 x 10s cells/ml) were infected with virus at a moi of 0.01 in the presence of serial D-D4FC dilutions. Each dilution was tested in triplicate. Culture supernatants were harvested day 7 post infection and assayed for p24 antigen production using a commercial assay (DuPont, NEN Products, Wilmington, Del.). Virus susceptibility is expressed as the concentration of drug required to inhibit production of p24 antigen by 50% (EC5o).<br>
DNA sequencing of selected virus reverse transcriptase. The viral RNA (vRNA) from selected virus was isolated using TRIzol Reagent (GibcoBRL, Grand Island, NY). The full-length RT coding region was amplified by RT-PCR. The PCR product was subsequently purified using Wizard PCR preps (Promega, Madison, WI) and sequenced.<br>
Production of mutant recombinant HIV-1. Mutant RT was generated using the Altered SitesII in vitro Mutagenesis System (Promega, Madison, WI). Mutagenesis was carried out on HIV-1 LAJ, RT cloned into a mutagenesis vector (PALTER, Promega). The presence of the desired mutation was determined by direct sequencing of the RT gene. The mutant RT was subsequently ligated into the pxxHIV-lLAi vector. Stocks of mutant virus were then prepared by electrophorating 5-10 ug of DNA into 1.3 x 107 MT-2 cells as described above.<br>
Results and Discussion<br>
Phenotyping of resistant virus. Virus resistant to D-D4FC was selected after 37 (selection #}) and 20 (selection #2) cycles of infection in MT-2 cells. Assessment of the D-D4FC susceptibility of virus from selection #1 passage 37 (p37 D-D4FC#1) demonstrated that p37 D-D4FC#l is 19.4-fold less sensitive to D-D4FC than wild type as demonstrated by an increase in the ECso, from 0.21 iM to 4.07 uM (Figure 2, Table 3). Assessment of the D-D4FC susceptibility of virus from selection #2 passage 20 (p20 D4FC #2) demonstrated that p20 D-D4FC#2 is 5.3-fold less sensitive to D-D4FC than wild type as demonstrated by an increase in the 50 from 0.21 uM to 1.1 |M (Figure 2, Table 3).<br>
Genotyping of resistant virus. vRNA from p37 D-D4FC#1 and p20 D-D-4FC#2 was isolated and subjected to amplification by RT-PCR. Sequencing of the PCR product revealed the presence of three novel mutations in p37 D-D4FC#I: K70N (AAA-MAAT), V901 (GTT-ATT) and Rl 72K (AGA-AAA) (Table 2). Two different mutations were identified in p20 D-D4FC#2: K65R (AAA-+AGA) and V179D (GTT—»GAT) (Table 3). No other mutations were found in the RT genes from these viruses (from amino acids 8-330). Additionally, no mutations were found in the control viruses passaged in parallel in the absence of drug.The isolation of D-D4FC resistant viruses with different associated mutations ould be the result of the different selection techniques used to isolate D-D4FC resistant virus. In selection #1, the selective pressure was removed for one cycle of infection prior to increasing the drug concentration. This was not done during the second selection procedure. Additionally, the starting concentration of D-D4FC used for each of the selection procedures varied approximately 3-fold. A much higher starting concentration of drug was used for selection #1 (0.75 uM). These two differences are likely the cause of the different mutations seen in the selected viruses.<br>
Mutant recombinant HIV-1. Mutant recombinant HIV-1 containing the mutations identified in the selected viruses were generated via site directed mutagenesis. Table 4 lists each of the mutant recombinant viruses generated as well as the corresponding ECso. While the xxHIV-, K65R virus demonstrated a 3,9-fold decrease in susceptibility to D-D4FC, none of the other viruses showed &gt;3.0 fold resistance. It should be noted, however,<br>
that the triple mutant (xxHIV-lLA], K70N/V90I/RI72K) did not grow well, and this could be the cause of the inability to reproduce the resistance observed in the in vitro selected virus.<br>

HI.      Combination or Alternation HIV-Agents<br>
In general, during alternation therapy, an effective dosage of each agent is administered serially, whereas in combination therapy, an effective dosage of two or more agents are administered together. In alternation therapy, for example, one or more first agents can be administered in an effective amount for an effective time period to treat the viral infection, and then one or more second agents substituted for those first agents in the therapy routine and likewise given in an effective amount for an effective time period.<br>
The dosages will depend on such factors as absorption, biodistribution, metabolism and excretion rates for each drug as well as other factors known to those of skill in the art. It is to be noted that dosage values will also vary with the severity of the condition to be alleviated. It is to be further understood that for any particular subject, specific dosage regimens and schedules should be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the compositions. Examples of suitable dosage ranges for anti-HIV compounds, including nucleoside derivatives (e.g. AZT, D4T, DDI, and 3TC) or protease inhibitors, for example, nelfinavir and indinavir, can be found in the scientific literature and in the Physicians Desk Reference. Many examples of suitable dosage ranges for other compounds described herein are also found in public literature or can be identified using known procedures. These dosage ranges can be modified as desired to achieve a desired result<br>
In one preferred embodiment, D-D4FC is administered in combination with a protease inhibitor. In particular embodiments, D-D4FC is administered in combination or alternation with indinavir (Crixivan), nelfinavir ([3S-[2(2S,3S),3-alpha,4-a-beta,8a-beta-]]-N-(l,l-dimemyIemyl)decahydro-2-)2-hydroxy-3-[(3-hydroxy-2-rnethylben2oyl)amino]-4-(phenylthio)buryl]-3-isoquinolincarboxamide mono-methanesulfonate) (Viracept), saquinavir (Invirase), or 141W94 (amprenavir; (Stetrahydrofuran-3-yl-N-[(lS,2R)-3-[N-[(4-aminophenyl)sulfonyl] -N-isobutylamino]-l -benzy!-2-hydroxypropyl]carbamate; or efavirenz (S)-6-chloro-4-(cyclopropylethynyl)- 1,4-dihydro-4-(trifluoromethyl)-2H-3, 1 -benzoxazin-2-one.).<br>
In another preferred embodiment, D-D4FC is administered in combination or alternation with a nucleoside analog, including abacavir (1592U89) which is (lS,4R)-4-[2-amino-6-cyclopropyl-amino)-9H-purin-9-yl]-2-cyclopentene-l-methanol succinate.<br>
In another embodiment, D-D4FC is administered in combination with a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor such as DMP-266 ((S)-6-chloro-4-cyclopropylethynyl-4-trifluoromethyl-1,4-dihydro-2H-3,1 -benzoxazin-2-one (SUSTIVA, see U.S. Patent No. 5,519,021); delavirdine, (]-[3-(l-methyl-ethyl)amino]-2-pyridinyl-4-[[5-[(methylsulfonyl)aminoJ- lH-indol-2-yl]carbonyl]-, monoethanesulfonate), nevirapine, or delarvirdine.<br>
In other embodiments, D-D4FC is administered in combination or alternation with an HIV-integrase inhibitor or a chemokine inhibitor.<br>
II.       Analysis of D-D4FC Induced Mutation of HIV Genome<br>
Methods and kits similar to those described in U.S. Patent No. 5,409,810 to Larder et al, for AZT, but based on the mutation profile for D-D4FC, can be used to analyze for the presence of D-D4FC induced mutations and thus form part of the invention presented herein. In addition to incorporating the Larder patent by reference in its entirety, these techniques are set out below.<br>
In one aspect of the invention there is provided a method of assessing the sensitivity of an HIV-1 sample to D-D4FC, which includes:<br>
(i)       isolating nucleic acid from the sample,<br>
(ii)      hybridizing an oligonucleotide to the nucleic acid, the<br>
oligonucleotide being complementary to a region of the wild-type DNA sequence (or its corresponding RNA) or to a region of the mutant DNA sequence (or its corresponding RNA); (iii)     attempting polymerization of the nucleic acid from the 3'-end<br>
of the oligonucleotide, (iv)     ascertaining whether or not an oligonucleotide primer extended<br>
product is present.<br>
It is possible to use genomic DNA or RNA isolated from HIV-1 samples in this methodology. Suitable cells for supporting the growth of HIV-1 isolate are incubated for a period of time. The cells are recovered by centrifugation. DNA can then be isolated by digestion of the cells with proteinase K in the presence of EDTA and a detergent such as SDS, followed by extraction with phenol.<br>
Well-known extraction and purification procedures are available for the isolation of DNA from a sample. RNA can be isolated using the following methodology. Suitable cells are being infected and incubated for a period of time. The cells are recovered by centrifugation. The cells are resuspended in an RNA extraction buffer followed by digestion using a proteinase digestion buffer and digestion with proteinase K. Proteins are removed in the presence of a phenol/chloroform mixture. RNA can then be recovered following further centrifugation steps. (Maniatis, T., et al, Molecular Coning, A laboratory Manual, 2nd Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, (1989)).<br>
Although it is possible to use unamplified nucleic acid, due to the relative scarcity of nucleic acid in an HIV-1 sample it is preferable to amplify it. Nucleic acid may be selectively amplified using the technique of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which is an in vitro method for producing large amounts of specific nucleic acid fragment of defined length and sequence from small amounts of a template.<br>
The PCR is comprised of standard reactants using Mg2+ concentration, oligonucleotide primers and temperature cycling conditions for amplification of the RT gene using the primers. The primers are chosen such that they will amplify the entire RT gene or a selected sequence which incorporates nucleotides corresponding to a region of the wild-type DNA sequence of HIV-1 that includes the codon which is mutated.<br>
RNA cannot be amplified directly by PCR. Its corresponding DNA must be synthesized. Synthesis of cDNA is normally carried out by primed reverse transcription using oligo-dT primers. Advantageously, primers are chosen such that they will simplify the nucleic acid sequence for RT or a selected sequence which incorporates nucleotides corresponding to the region of RNA corresponding to the wild-type DNA sequence or to the region of the mutant DNA sequence corresponding to the 70th (K to N), 90th or 172th codon of the reverse transcriptase region. This could be achieved by preparing an oligonucleotide primer which is complementary to a region of the RNA strand which is upstream of the corresponding sequence of the wild-type DNA sequence. cDNA prepared by this methodology (see Maniatis, T., et al., supra.) can then be used in the same way as for the DNA already discussed.<br>
The next stage of the methodology is to hybridize to the nucleic acid an oligonucleotide which is complementary to a region of the wild-type DNA sequence (or its corresponding RNA) or to a region of the mutant DNA sequence (or its corresponding RNA).<br>
Conditions and reagents are then provided to permit polymerization of the nucleic acid from the 3'-end of the oligonucleotide primer. Such polymerization reactions are well-known in the art.<br>
If the oligonucleotide primer has at its 3'-end a nucleotide which is<br>
complementary to a mutant genotype, that is a genotype which has a nucleotide change at the 70th (K to N), 90th or 172th codon in the RT region, then polymerization of the nucleic acid sequence will only occur if the nucleic acid of the sample is the same as the mutant genotype. Polymerization of a wild type nucleic acid sequence will not occur or at least not to a significant extent because of a mis-match of nucleotides at the 3'-end of the oligonucleotide primer and the nucleic acid sequence of the sample.<br>
If the oligonucleotide primer has at its 3'-end of nucleotide which is complementary to the wild-type genotype, that is a genotype which has the wild-type nucleotide at the 70th (K to N), 90th or 172th codon in the RT region, then there will be polymerization of a nucleic acid sequence which is wild-type at that position. There will be no polymerization of a nucleic acid which has a mutant nucleotide at the 3'-position.<br>
The preferred length of each oligonucleotide is 15-20 nucleotides. The oligonucleotide can be prepared according to methodology well known to the man skilled in the art (Koster, H., Drug Research, 30 p548 (1980); Koster, H., Tetrahedron Letters p!527 (1972); Caruthers, Tetrahedron Letters, p719, (1980); Tetrahedron Letters, pi859, (1981); Tetrahedron Letters 24, p245, (1983); Gate. M. Nucleic Acid Research, 8, pi 081, (1980)) and is generally prepared using an automated DNA synthesizer such as an Applied Biosystems 381A synthesizer.<br>
It is convenient to determine the presence of an oligonucleotide primer extended product The means for carrying out the detection is by using an appropriate label.<br>
The label may be conveniently attached to the oligonucleotide primer or to some other molecule which will bind the primer extended polymerization product.<br>
The label may be for example an enzyme, radioisotope or fluorochrome. A preferred label may be biotin which could be subsequently detected using streptavidin conjugated to an enzyme such as peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase. The presence of an oligonucleotide primer extended polymerization product can be detected for example by running the polymerization reaction on an agarose gel and observing a specific DNA fragment labeled with ethidium bromide, or Southern blotted and autoradiographed to detect<br>
the presence or absence of bands corresponding to polymerised product. If a predominant band is present which corresponds only to the labeled oligonucleotide then this indicates that polymerization has been occurred. If bands are present of the correct predicted size, this would indicate that polymerization has occurred.<br>
For example, DNA isolated from patients' lymphocytes as described herein is used as a template for PCR amplification using synthetic oligonucleotide primers which either match or mis-match with the amplified sequences. The feasibility of PCR in detecting such mutations has already been demonstrated. PCR using the Amplification Refractory Mutation system ("ARMS") (Newton, C.R., et al. Nucleic Acids Research, 17, p2503, (1989)) Synthetic oligonucleotide are produced that anneal to the regions adjacent to an including the specific mutations such that the 3' ENDE of the oligonucleotide either matches of mismatches with a mutant or wild-type sequence. PCR is carried out which results in the identification of a DNA fragment (using gel electrophoresis) where a match has occurred or no fragment where a mismatch occurred.<br>
DNA is extracted from HIV-1 infected T-cells as described herein and subjected to "ARMS" PCR analysis using these primers.<br>
The presence of a fragment is identified by using an oligonucleotide primer as described above, i.e., by attempting polymerisation using an oligonucleotide primer which may be labeled for the amplified DNA fragment under stringent conditions which only allow hybridization of complementary DNA (the only difference is that differential hybridization does not have to be performed as fragments of DNA amplified by the "ARMS" method will be the same whether derived from mutant or wild-type DNS, so a common oligonucleotide can be used to detect the presence of these fragments. The sequence of such an oligonucleotide is derived from a DNA sequence within the DNA fragment that is conserved amongst HIV-1 strains).<br>
The above PCR assay may be adapted to enable direct detection of mutations associated with D-D4FC resistance in DNA from PBL samples from infected individuals that have not been cultured to obtain virus. As this material generally contains considerably less HIV-1 CMA. than that in infected lymphoid cultures a "double PCR" (or nested set) protocol can be used (Simmonds, P., Balfe, P, Peutherer, J.F., Ludlarn, C. A., Bishop, J.O. and Leigh Brown, A. Virol., 64, 864-872, (1990)) to boost the amount of target HIV-1 RT DNA signal in the samples. The double PCR overcomes the problem of limited amplification of a<br>
rare template sequence. A small amount of the pre-amplified material may be used in the second PCR with primer pairs designed to allow discrimination of wild type and mutant residues.<br>
A suitable test kit for use in an assay to determine the resistance status of an HIV-1 sample to D-D4FC which makes use of a methodology according to the first aspect of the invention, comprises an oligonucleotide being complementary to a region of the wild-type DNA sequence (or its corresponding RNA) or to a region of the mutant DNA sequence as described herein, other materials required for polymerisation of the nucleic acid from the 3'-end of the oligonucleotide and means for determining the presence of an oligonucleotide primer extended product. Such other materials include appropriate en2ymes, buffers and washing solutions, and a label and a substrate for the label if necessary. If PCR is used to amplify nucleic acid then additional materials such as appropriate oligonucleotide primers which will amplify a region of the wild-type DNA sequence (or its corresponding RNA) or a region of the mutant DNA sequence as described herein (or its corresponding RNA) and dNTP's should be included.<br>
In a second aspect of the invention there is provided a method of determining the sensitivity of an HIV-1 sample to D-D4FC which comprises:<br>
(i)       isolating the nucleic acid from the sample;<br>
(ii)      hybridizing the nucleic acid with an oligonucleotide being<br>
complementary to a region of the wild-type DNA sequence (or its corresponding RNA) or to a region of the mutant DNA sequence set forth in FIG.l (or its corresponding RNA) containing one or more of the nucleotides at the region of the 70th (K to N), 90th or 172th codon in the RT region; and (iii)     ascertaining whether or not any of the resulting hybrids of the oligonucleotide and nucleic acid have complementary nucleotides at one of these positions.<br>
Preferably the oligonucleotide is so designed to form a perfectly matched hybrid with its complement.<br>
Nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) is isolated from a sample by the aforementioned methods as described for the first aspect of the invention.<br>
Similarly, PCR may be used to amplify the RT DNA (or its corresponding RNA) or preferably to amplify a region of the RT DNA (or its corresponding RNA) which incorporates DNA (or its corresponding RNA) containing one or more of the nucleotides at the designated position.<br>
In the second stage of this methodology the nucleic acid is then used to hybridize to oligonucleotides complementary to a region of the wild-type DNA sequence (or its corresponding (RNA) or to a region of the mutant DNA sequence.<br>
The oligonucleotide may be of any length depending on the number of nucleotide positions of interest which are being examined. If the oligonucleotide is designed to include a nucleotide at only one position of interest then this nucleotide is preferably at or close to the center position of the oligonucleotide.<br>
In order to ascertain whether or not the oligonucleotide and nucleic acid sequence have formed a matched hybrid, specific hybridization conditions are set so that a hybrid is only formed when the nucleotide or nucleotides at the 70th (K to N), 90th or 172th codon of the reverse transcriptase region are complementary to the corresponding nucleotide or nucleotides of the oligonucleotide which either permits hybridization or no hybridization. It is important to establish for example the temperature of the reaction and the concentration of salt solution before carrying out the hybridization step to find conditions that are stringent enough to guarantee specificity (Maniatis, T., et al., Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 2nd edition, Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory Press, (1989). If the oligonucleotide probe has a DNA sequence which is complementary to a wild-type nucleic acid sequence at one or more of its nucleotides corresponding to the 70th (K to N), 90th or 172th codon in the reverse transcriptase region then this oligonucleotide will hybridize perfectly to wild-type nucleic acid. If there is no hybridize perfectly to wild-type nucleic acid. If there is no hybridization then this would suggest that the nucleic acid isolated from the same contains one or more mutations.<br>
If the oligonucleotide probe has a DNA sequence which is complementary to a mutant nucleic acid sequence then this oligonucleotide will hybridize to mutant nucleic acid. If there is no hybrids 4on this would suggest that the nucleic acid isolated from the sample contains no such mutation or mutations. The oligonucleotide probes may be labeled as a means of detection as for the first aspect of the invention.<br>
The hybridization and subsequent removal of non-hybridized nucleic acids are performed under stringent conditions which only allow hybridization of the complementary DNA and not the oligonucleotide containing a mismatch (i.e. oligonucleotide specific hybridization as described for the detection of sickle cell mutation using the p-globin or HLA-DQa gene (Saikt, R. K., et al., Nature, 324, p163, (1986), the activated Ras gene (Ver Laan-de, Vries, M, et al., Gene, 50, 313, (1986)) and p-thalassaemia Wong, C., et al., Nature, 330, p384, (1987)).<br>
The hybridization may be carried out by immobilization of the RT nucleic acid sequence onto nitrocellulose, nylon or other solid matrix (e.g. dot-blot). It is convenient to determine the presence of an hybrid by using the means of a label. For example, the chemically synthesized oligonucleotide probes can be suitably labeled using enzyme, radioisotope or fluorochrome. A preferred label may be biotin which could be subsequently detected using streptavidin conjugated to an enzyme such as peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase.<br>
Alternatively the hybridization may be carried out by immobilization of the chemically synthesized oligonucleotides referred to above, which are unlabeled, onto a solid support referred to above and subsequent hybridization by a labeled RT nucleic acid sequence as described previously.<br>
In both situations described above for hybridization suitable control reactions will be incorporated to determine that efficient hybridization has occurred, (e.g., the hybridization of oligonucleotides to a complementary oligonucleotide).<br>
Results would be readily interpreted as the isolated nucleic acid would hybridize to either the wild type oligonucleotide or the mutant oligonucleotide.<br>
A suitable test kit for use in an assay to determine the sensitivity of an HIV-1 sample to D-D4FC which makes use of a methodology according to the second aspect of the invention comprises an oligonucleotide being complementary to a region of the wild-type DNA sequence (or its corresponding RNA) or to the pertinent region of the mutant DNA sequence, along with other materials required to permit hybridization. Such materials include appropriate buffers and washing solutions and a label and a substrate for the label if necessary. Normally the oligonucleotide would be labeled. If PCR is used to amplify nucleic acid prior to hybridization then additional materials such as appropriate oligonucleotide primers which will amplify a region of the wild-type DNA sequence (or its corresponding<br>
RNA) or a region of the mutant DNA sequence, appropriate enzymes and NTP's (deoxy nucleotide triphosphates) should be included.<br>
In one alternate format of the assay, the dNTP's in the amplification may or may not be coupled to a detector molecule such as a radioisotope, biotin, fluorochrome or enzyme.<br>
It is also possible to detect zidovudine resistant mutations in the HIV-1 RT RNA isolated from clinical samples using an RNA amplification system. Using the methodology described by Guatelli etal. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, (USA), 8/7,1874-1878, (March 1990)) a target nucleic acid sequence can be replicated (amplified) exponentially in vitro under isothermal conditions by using three enzymatic activities essential to retroviral replication: reverse transcriptase, RNase H and a DNA-dependant RNA polymerase. Such a methodology may be employed followed by an hybridization step to distinguish mutant from wild-type nucleotides at discussed previously.<br>
PREPARATION OF PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS<br>
Humans suffering from effects caused by any of the diseases described herein, and in particular, HIV infection, can be treated by administering to the patient an effective amount of D-D4FC or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug thereof in the presence of a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent, for any of the indications or modes of administration as described in detail herein. The active materials can be administered by any appropriate route, for example, orally, parenterally, enterally, intravenously, intradermally, subcutaneously, transdermally, intranasally or topically, in liquid or solid form.<br>
The active compound(s) are included in the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent in an amount sufficient to deliver to a patient a therapeutically effective amount of compound to inhibit viral replication in vivo, especially HIV replication, without causing serious toxic effects in the treated patient. By "inhibitory amount" is meant an amount of active ingredient sufficient to exert an inhibitory effect as measured by, for example, an assay such as the or.    described herein.<br>
A preferred dose of the compound for all the above-mentioned conditions will be in the range from about 1 to 75 mg/kg, preferably 1 to 20 mg/kg, of body weight per day, more generally 0.1 to about 100 mg per kilogram body weight of the recipient per day. The<br>
effective dosage range of the pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives can be calculated based on the weight of the parent nucleoside to be delivered. If the derivative exhibits activity in itself, the effective dosage can be estimated as above using the weight of the derivative, or by other means known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The compounds are conveniently administered in unit any suitable dosage form, including but not limited to one containing 7 to 3000 mg, preferably 70 to 1400 mg of active ingredient per unit dosage form. An oral dosage of 50 to 1000 mg is usually convenient<br>
Ideally, the active ingredient should be administered to achieve peak plasma concentrations of the active compound of from about 0.02 to 70 micromolar, preferably about 0.5 to 10 mM. This may be achieved, for example, by the intravenous injection of a 0.1 to 25% solution of the active ingredient, optionally in saline, or administered as a bolus of the active ingredient.<br>
The concentration of active compound in the drug composition will depend on absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion rates of the drug as well as other factors known to those of skill in the art. It is to be noted that dosage values will also vary with the severity of the condition to be alleviated. It is to be further understood that for any particular subject, specific dosage regimens should be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the compositions, and that the concentration ranges set forth herein are exemplary only and are not intended to limit the scope or practice of the claimed composition. The active ingredient may be administered at once, or may be divided into a number of smaller doses to be administered at varying intervals of time.<br>
A preferred mode of administration of the active compound is oral. Oral compositions will generally include an inert diluent or an edible carrier. They may be enclosed in gelatin capsules or compressed into tablets. For the purpose of oral therapeutic administration, the active compound can be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of tablets, troches, or capsules. Pharmaceutically compatible bind agents, and/or adjuvant materials can be included as part of the composition.<br>
The tablets, pills, capsules, troches and the like can contain any of the following ingredients, or compounds of a similar nature: a binder such as microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatin; an excipient such as starch or lactose, a disintegrating<br>
agent such as alginic acid, Primogel, or corn starch; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate or Sterotes; a glidant such as colloidal silicon dioxide; a sweetening agent such as sucrose or saccharin; or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, methyl salicylate, or orange flavoring. When the dosage unit form is a capsule, it can contain, in addition to material of the above type, a liquid carrier such as a fatty oil. In addition, dosage unit forms can contain various other materials which modify the physical form of the dosage unit, for example, coatings of sugar, shellac, or other enteric agents.<br>
The compounds can be administered as a component of an elixir, suspension, syrup, wafer, chewing gum or the like. A syrup may contain, in addition to the active compounds, sucrose as a sweetening agent and certain preservatives, dyes and colorings and flavors.<br>
The compounds or their pharmaceutically acceptable derivative or salts thereof can also be mixed with other active materials that do not impair the desired action, or with materials that supplement the desired action, such as antibiotics, antifungals, antiinflammatories, protease inhibitors, or other nucleoside or non-nucleoside antiviral agents, as discussed in more detail above. Solutions or suspensions used for parental, intradermal, subcutaneous, or topical application can include the following components: a sterile diluent such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils, polyethylene glycols, glycerine, propylene glycol or other synthetic solvents; antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; buffers such as acetates, citrates or phosphates and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. The parental preparation can be enclosed in ampoules, disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic.<br>
If administered intravenously, preferred carriers are physiological saline or phosphate buffered saline (PBS).<br>
Liposomal suspensions (including liposomes targeted to infected cells with monoclonal antibodies to viral antigens) are also preferred as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, these may be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,522,811 (which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). For example, liposome formulations may be prepared by dissolving appropriate lipid(s) (such as stearoyl phosphatidyl ethanolamine, stearoyl phosphatidyl<br>
choline, arachadoyl phosphatidyl choline, and cholesterol) in an inorganic solvent that is then evaporated, leaving behind a thin film of dried lipid on the surface of the container. An aqueous solution of the active compound or its monophosphate, diphosphate, and/or triphosphate derivatives is then introduced into the container. The container is then swirled by hand to free lipid material from the sides of the container and to disperse lipid aggregates, thereby forming the liposomal suspension. Controlled Release Formulations<br>
All of the U.S. patents cited in this section on controlled release formulations are incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
The field of biodegradable polymers has developed rapidly since the synthesis and biodegradability of polylactic acid was reported by Kulkami et al., in 1966 ("Polylactic acid for surgical implants," Arch. Surg., 93:839). Examples of other polymers which have been reported as useful as a matrix material for delivery devices include polyanhydrides, polyesters such as polyglycolides and polylactide-co-glycolides, polyamino acids such as polylysine, polymers and copolymers of polyethylene oxide, acrylic terminated polyethylene oxide, polyamides, polyurethanes, polyorthoesters, polyacrylonitriles, and polyphosphazenes. See, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,891,225 and 4,906,474 to Langer (polyanhydrides), 4,767,628 to Hutchinson (polylactide, polylactide-co-glycolide acid), and 4,530,840 to Tice, et al. (polylactide, polyglycolide, and copolymers). See also U.S. patent No. 5,626,863 to Hubbell, et al which describes photopolymerizable biodegradable hydrogels as tissue contacting materials and controlled release carriers (hydrogels of polymerized and crossl inked macromers comprising hydrophilic oligomers having biodegradable monomeric or oligomeric extensions, which are end capped monomers or oligomers capable of polymerization and crosslinking); and PCT WO 97/05185 filed by Focal, Inc. directed to multiblock biodegradable hydrogels for use as controlled release agents for drug delivery and tissue treatment agents.<br>
Degradable materials of biological origin are well known, for example, crosslinked gelatin. Hyaluronic acid has been crosslinked and used as a degradable swelling polymer for biomedical applications (U.S. Patent 4,957,744 to Delia Valle et. al.; (1991) "Surface modification of polymeric biomaterials for reduced thrombogenicity," Polym. Mater. Sci. Eng., 62:731-735]).<br>
Many dispersion systems are currently in use as, or being explored for use as, carriers of substances, particularly biologically active compounds. Dispersion systems used for pharmaceutical and cosmetic formulations can be categorized as either suspensions or emulsions. Suspensions are defined as solid particles ranging in size from a few manometers up to hundreds of microns, dispersed in a liquid medium using suspending agents. Solid particles include microspheres, microcapsules, and nanospheres. Emulsions are defined as dispersions of one liquid in another, stabilized by an interfacial film of emulsifiers such as surfactants and lipids. Emulsion formulations include water in oil and oil in water emulsions, multiple emulsions, microemulsions, microdroplets, and liposomes.
