Title<br>
A process of preparing a new hair colour composition.<br>
Godrej Soaps Limited, Eastern Express Highway, Vikhroli, Mumbai 400 079, Maharashtra, India, an Indian Company.<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.                           GRANTED<br><br>
7-12-2004<br>
ORIGINAL<br><br>
The present invention relates to a process of preparing a hair colour composition intended for dyeing/coloring of the hair with cationic surfactant as a base. Hair dye or color preparations have been available for decades in a variety of forms including-liquids, creams, gels and powders. These compositions generally contain anionic surfactants or soap base.<br>
It is object of the invention to provide a process of preparing a hair dye preparation based upon cationic surfactant.<br>
From 5 to 25 percent by weight based upon the total weight of the preparation, of a cationic surfactant of the quaternary ammonium compounds, selected from the salts of alkylamidopropyldimethylamine. The salts are extremely mild to skin and eyes. They are excellent conditioners for use in shampoos and hair dyes.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to provide a hair dye preparation comprising a mixture of an oxidation-coloring agent, a cationic surfactant, and wetting agents.<br>
It is also an object of the invention to provide an aqueous preparations for the simultaneous coloring, washing and conditioning of human hair after addition of oxidation agent, which consists essentially from about 0.02 to 6 percent by weight, based upon the total weight of the preparation, of coupler-precursor oxidation coloring agent comprising at least one coupler selected from the group consisting of  resorcinol,   2-   methyl   resorcinol,   m-aminophenol,   o-aminophenol,   alpha<br><br><br>
naphthol, m-phenylenediamine and at least one precursor selected from the group consisting of p-phenylenediamine, p-aminophenol, p-toluenediamine.<br>
Coloring hair as an act of adornment by men and women exists in most civilizations. It is estimated that 20-30% of the women colour their hair either at home using commercially available hair colouring products or at a saloon. Various systems for coloring hair exist.<br>
Temporary hair coloring are those which last generally until the first shampoo. The colors are generally basic dyes, acid disperse dyes, pigments or metiallic dyes, belonging to various chemical classes.<br>
Semi-permanent hair coloring is resistant to several shampooings. The colours employed are typically direct dyes of low molecular weight and capable of penetrating the cortex of the hair.<br>
Permanent hair colorings are those that are resistant to shampooing, brushing, friction, light, etc. the oxidation dyes, or para-dyes, used in permanent hair coloring are colorless until oxidized by oxidizing agent, typically hydrogen peroxide or a derivative.<br>
Product /dye preparations may be present as<br>
•	Liquids<br>
•	Creams Foams<br><br>
•    Gels<br>
•    Powders<br>
Oxidation hair coloring products are generally more damaging to the hair therefore it is desirable to incorporate conditioning materials in the base, like monomeric quaternary salts.<br>
However, oxidation hair colorants generally contain alkaline soaps or anionic surfactants, thereby leaving the hair lusterless and hard to feel, thus limiting the use of cationic conditioners in anionic base, due to their incompatible nature. In an effort to overcome these disadvantages, it has been proposed to make the hair dye with cationic surfactant to impart to the hair its original appearance while improving its luster and its softness to the touch. Thus, the present invention relates to a new composition for dyeing the hair comprising a carrier in the form of gel or liquid containing cationic surfactant.<br>
The present invention relates to a new cosmetic composition for dyeing living human hair, as well as to a process for dyeing the hair using the said composition. The essential components of the composition according to the invention are described below.<br>
A hair dye composition comprising a hair dye in the form of a gel or liquid, at least one cationic surfactant in an amount between 5 and 25 percent by weight relative<br><br><br>
to the total weight of said composition. Preferable Cationic surfactant is 1, 2-dihydroxy propyl dimethyl cocoamido propylammonium chloride.<br>
The composition of the invention wherein said hair dye support is in the form of a gel or liquid and comprises 0-25 percent of ethoxylated fatty alcohol derived from the fatty acids, alcohols used may be lauryl and / or oleyl.<br>
0 to 20 weight percent of an alcohol and or a glycol, as a solvent;<br>
0-15 weight percent of a fatty amide;<br>
The composition of the invention also includes a coupler in an amount between 0.002 to 6 percent weight, based on the total weight of composition.<br>
The composition also include a precursor in an amount between 0.002 to 6 percent by weight, based on the total weight of said composition.<br>
The composition of the invention comprises 0.20 weight percent of a fatty alcohol; and remainder being water.<br>
The above composition, which also includes a sufficient amount of a base, selected from the group consisting of ammonia, monoethanolamine, diethanolamine and triethanolamine so that said composition has said pH value.<br><br><br>
The said composition having a pH between 9 and 11.<br>
A process for dyeing hair comprising applying to the hair an effective amount of the composition of the invention together with a sufficient amount of hydrogen peroxide, permitting said composition to remain in contact with said hair for 15-45 minutes and rinsing said hair.<br>
It has been found that the presence of cationic surfactant significantly improves the luster, the brilliance, the feel and the untangling of the hair after a dyeing operation. The cationic surfactants incorporated in modem formulations are the quaternary ammonium compounds, which comply with the general formula (RN) X where R is a fatty chain and X is a halide. The invention concerns a composition comprising from 5 to 25 percent by weight based on the total weight of preparation of a cationic surfactant. Neutralized product of amidoamines are the salts which are used as cationic surfactants. These salts of dye to the hair in a short period of time.<br>
Thus according to the present invention a process for preparing a hair colour<br>
composition, comprising the steps of reacting<br>
a) cationic surfactants which are quaternary ammonium compounds having general formula (RN)+ X" where R is a fatty chain having C12 - C20 and X is a halide, in an amount between 5 and 25 percent by weight relative to the total weight of the composition;<br><br><br>
b)	a known coupler in an amount between 0.002 to 6 percent weight by ratio;<br>
c)	a known precursor in an amount between 0.002 to 6 percent weight by ratio; and<br>
d)	water;<br>
and then adding<br>
known cosmetic aids or carriers acting as a solvent selected from the group of wetting agents polyglycol; thickener in 0 to 20 weight percent; wherein the temperature of the aforesaid process ranges from 15 C to 40 C.<br>
Thus, the present invention relates to process for preparing a composition for dyeing the hair comprising in a carrier in the form of a gel or liquid at least one cationic surfactant resulting from the neutralization of cocaamidopropyl dimethylamine with, 3-chloro 1.2 propandiol; 1,2 dihydroxy propane; methyle chloride; propyl; benzyl chloride.<br>
It has been found that the presence of this type of cationic surfactant significantly improves the luster, the brilliance, the feel and the untangling of the hair after a dyeing operation.<br>
The alkalizing agent used can be principally sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonia, mono ethanolamine, di-ethanolamine, tri-ethanolamine, 2-amino-2-methyl-l- propanol. The pH of the invention is adjusted generally between 9 and 11.<br><br>
Representative fatty alcohol's include, in particular, alcohol's derived from the fatty acids of copras, lauryl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, isostearyl alcohol, hydroxyl stearyl alcohol, hydroxyl stearyl alcohol, oleyl alcohol, in an amount ranging generally between 0 to 20 weight percent and preferably between 5 to 15 percent by weight.<br>
Other emulsifiers that can be used include synthetic fatty alcohols oxyethylenated as for example, polyoxyethylenated oleyl alcohol having 2-20 moles of ethylene oxide.<br>
Further, the composition can contain various conventional adjuvants such as fatty amides.<br>
Representative fatty amides include, preferably, mono, or diethanolamides and amides of the acids derived from copra and from lauric acid or from oleic acid in an amount ranging generally between 0 and 15 weight percent.<br>
This composition can also contain sequestering agents such as ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid or its salts, antioxidants, perfumes and the like.<br>
In accordance with a particularly interesting embodiment of the present invention, the hair dying compositions are provided in the form of liquid capable of forming a gel. This type of liquid provides principally, the advantage of being more easy to handle and to prepare than creams, principally in view of producing a mixture with<br><br>
hydrogen peroxide moreover, the transparency of the gels permit to follow without difficulty the development of the coloration of the hair.<br>
The solvents used can be lower aliphatic alcohols such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, and glycols such as propylene glycol, di-ethylene glycol, di-propylene glycol hexylene glycol. These solvents or a mixture thereof, is generally used in amounts of 0 to 20 percent and preferably from 5 to 18 weight percent.<br>
The precursor or oxidation dye is present in the dye composition of the invention in an amount ranging between about 0.002 and 6 weight percent thereof. Representative oxidation dyes include for instance p-phenylene diamine, p-toluene diamine, o-phenylene diamine methoxy paraphenylene diamine, o-amino phenol, p-amino phenol, of a salt of said compound for example a mono, di or tri-hydrochloride, or hydrobromide or even sulphate thereof.<br>
The oxidation dye, most often in a mixture can also be combined with a coupler in an amount between 0.002 to 6 weight percent. Representative couplers for instance resorcinol, 2-methyl resorcinol, m-amino phenol, o-amino phenol, alpha naphthol and m-phenylenediamine.<br>
For the treatment of the hair for the simultaneous dyeing, washing and conditioning, the preparation according to the invention is mixed directly before use with one of the above mentioned oxidants. The preparation is according to the invention a solution particularly alkaline medium at a pH of from about 8 to 10.<br><br>
The application temperature ranges from about 15 degree to 40 degree C. After an action of from about 15 to 45 minutes, the hair is lathered with some water and subsequently rinsed clear. The hair dyed after this single stage treatment is in the desired shade, is easy to comb when wet, and has good luster a good feel after drying.<br>
