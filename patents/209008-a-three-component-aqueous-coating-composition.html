DESCRIPTION<br>
AQUEOUS COATING COMPOSITION<br>
This invention relates to a three component coating composition containing an acrylic polyol having an acid value, a base, a crosslinker and water. It also relates to a process for producing the coating composition, to a process of coating using the composition and to a coated substrate obtainable by the coating process.<br>
Coating compositions that comprise hydroxy functional polymers and a polyisocyanate compound have been known for some years. These traditionally comprise a hydroxyl functional acrylic copolymer together with a polyisocyanate compound in solution in an organic solvent. The isocyanate groups on the polyisocyanate react with the hydroxyl groups on the acrylic polymer so as to form a crosslinked film. Such reaction takes place at room temperature or at moderately elevated temperatures.<br>
Due to environmental considerations there is a general trend in the coatings industry towards coating compositions with reduced organic solvent content Coatings ^th a lower organic solvent content emit lower levels of solvent when they are used and so are less polluting of the atmosphere.<br>
One way to achieve a lower solvent content is to use waterhole compositions.<br><br>
One method of incorporating acrylic addition polymers into water is to make them carboxyl (-COOH) functional by the incorporation of some carboxyl functional ethylenically unsaturated monomer such as acrylic acid during their manufacture, and neutralising at least some of the carboxyl groups in the aqueous composition by adding a base such as alkali metal hydroxide, ammonia or an amine. The resulting neutralized carboxyl groups stabilise the polymer in dispersion in water-US 5 075 370 describes a two component composition consisting of an aqueous solution or dispersion of an acrylic polyol and a polyisocyanate. The acrylic polyol contains chemically incorporated carboxylate or sulphonate groups. The polyisocyanate is emulsified in the aqueous solution or dispersion of the acrylic copolymer. The compositions contain relatively high levels of neutralised carboxyl groups.<br>
EP 557 844 also describes a two component composition consisting of an aqueous dispersion of an acrylic polyol and a polyisocyanate. Once again the polyisocyanate is emulsified in the aqueous solution or dispersion of the acrylic copolymer. The acrylic copolymer has a low acid value in the range 0 to 7 mg KOH/g and a total content of sulphonate and carboxylate groups of 0 to 4.5 milliequivalents per 100 g of solid resin. However the system can be dispersed into water primarily because of the presence of anionic and/or non-ionic emulsifiers. Additionally the polyisocyanate has an ethylene oxide content of 2 to 20% within polyester chains.<br><br>
An alternative approach is described in EP 663 413 which describes a coating composition obtained by emulsifying a homogeneous mixture of polyisocyanate and an isocyanate reactive surface-active material in water. However isocyanate reactive surface-active material has a relatively high carboxy group content and the composition contains relatively high levels of base.<br>
A problem which we have discovered is that in practice dilution with water to achieve suitable viscosities for application can result in a solids content that is too low to achieve adequate film build per coat For spray application a solids content of 35-60% is preferred,<br>
A further problem is that these compositions posses inferior water and humidity resistance in comparison to their solvent borne counterparts. This is particularly the case when they are used in conjunction with other waterbuses compositions in miiltilayer systems. One cause for the inferior water resistance may be the presence of hydrophilic components necessary to allow the compositions to be carried in water. Tie use of carboxy functional monomers at relatively high levels, together with the associated neutralising amine, may lead to poor water resistance when these polymers are made into coating compositions. EP 557 844 uses acrylic polyols with low acid values but in practice other emulsifiers are used during their preparation. The polyisocyanate is also required to contain hydrophihc polyethylene oxide chains to assist with dispersion into water.  The presence of additional emulsifier and polyethylene oxide will adversely<br><br>
affect the humidity resistance of the coating composition.<br>
The invention relates to the use of low levels of base neutralized acid groups in the polyol and we have found that we can produce waterbome two pack polyurethane coating compositions that contain low levels of base neutralised carboxylic acid groups, and that these compositioiis have high solids at application viscosity and exhibit improved water and humidity resistance compared to prior art systems.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a three component coating composition comprising;<br>
(I) a first component containing at least one acrylic polyol having a carboxyl group content of 0.035 to 2.0 moles/kg, said acrylic polyol being dissolved in a volatile organic solvent,<br>
(ii) a second component containing at least one polyisocyanate, and<br>
(iii) a third component containing water,<br>
at least one of said components also including a base, the base being present in an amount capable of neutralising 0.035 to 0.2 moles of carboxyl groups per kilogram of polyol,<br>
the composition being   essentially free from other hydrophilizdng groups or<br><br>
components.<br>
Where reference is made to the base being present in an amount capable of neutralising 0.035 to 0.2 moles of carboxyl groups per kilogram of polyol, it is to be understood that the polyol includes the acrylic polyol referred to together with any other polyol present in the composition.<br>
By "essentially free from hydrophilizdng groups or components" as used throughout this specification (including the claims) we mean that the base neutralised carboxy groups are primarily responsible for allowing the system to be dispersed in water. Preferably the base neutralised carboxy groups are solely responsible for allowing the system to be dispersed in water.<br>
The acrylic polyol having a carboxyl group content of 0.035 to 2,0 moles/kg is derived from polymerisable ethylenically unsaturated monomers such as alkyl esters of (meth) screech acid and vinyl monomers.<br>
"When used herein, the term acryhc monomer refers to acrylic or methacrylic acid or their esters. The term (meth)acrylate refers to both the acrylate and methacrylate equally and the term (meth)atrium acid refers to acrylic or methacryhc acid equally.<br>
Examples of suitable alkyl esters of (meth)accrue acid are C|_22 alkyl esters such as methyl (meth)acrylate, ethyl (meth)acrylate, n-butyl (meth)acrylate, t-butyl<br><br>
(meth)acrylate, n-propyl (meth)acrylate, 2-ethyl hexyl (meth)acrylate, isobutyl (meth)acrylate and lauryl (meth)acrylate. Examples of vinyl monomers are styreue and alpha-methyl styrene.<br>
Optionally chain transfer agents can be otiose Chain transfer agents are compounds that are used in the manufacture of acrylic addition polymers to control their molecular weight. Examples of knave chain transfer agents include mercapto compounds. Examples of mercapto compounds that can be used include octyl mercaptan, dodecyl mercaptan and pentaerythritol tetra(3-mercaptopropionate).<br>
The carboxyl group content can be derived from unsaturated monomers having carboxyl groups and/or initiators having carboxyl groups. Examples of monomers; having carboxyl groups are acrylic acid, methacrylic acid and beta-carboxyethyl acrylate. Examples of chain transfer agents having carboxyl groups are mercaptoacetic acid, 3-mercaptopropionic acid and 2-raercaptopropionic acid. An example of an initiator having a carboxyl group is 4,4'-a2obis(4-cyanoverlaric acid). It is also possible to produce carboxyl groups by modifying the polymer. For example hydroxyl functional groups can be reacted with cyclic anhydrides such as phthalic anhydride or hexhhydraphthalic anhydride. Preferably the carboxyl groups are derived from (meth)acrylic acid and'or 3-mercaptopropionic acid.<br>

The hydroxyl groups can be derived from vinyl and/or acrylic monomers having hydroxyl groups and from chain transfer agents having hydroxyl   An example of a vinyl monomer having hydroxyl groups is vinyl alcohol. Examples of acrylic monomers having hydroxyl groups are hydroxyethyl (meth)acrylate, hydroxypropyl (meth)acrylate and 4-hydroxybutyl (meth)acrylate. An example of a chain transfer agent having hydroxyl groups is mercaptoethanol.<br>
Other examples of suitable acrylic monomers having hydroxyl groups are the reaction products of glycidyl (meth)acrylate with mono-carboxylic acids, such as versatic acid and the reaction product of (meth)acetic acid with monopoly compounds such as Cardura E (the glycidyl ester of versatic acid; trade mark of Shell),<br>
Preferably the acrylic polyol has a hydroxyl value of 5 to 500 MgCh/g of acrylic polyol, more preferably 50 to 250.<br>
The acrylic polyol can contain other functional groups that may take part in chemical reactions during the application and cure of the coating composition. Such functional units can be derived from monomers -which carry reactive groups other than hydroxyl groups or carboxyl groups, such as acetoacetate groups and epoxy groups. An example of a monomer carrying an acetoacetate group is aceotacetoxyethyl (meth)<br><br>
aciylate. An example of a monomer carrying an epoxy group is glycidyl (meth) acrylate.<br>
Preferred acrylic polyols having carboxyl group content have a number average molecxdar weight as measured by gel permeation chromatography of 700 to 10 000, more preferably 1 000 to 6 000, most preferably 1 500 to 5 000,<br>
Preferred acrylic polyols have a theoretical glass transition temperature (Fox Tg) of "30 to 100 °C, more preferably -10 to 70 °C.<br>
The acrylic polyol can be produced by conventional means. For example, in general it can be produced by contacting a mixture of the appropriate monomers including the chain transfer agent with a polymerisation initiator at a temperature at<br>
which polymerisation occurs,<br><br>
The process for preparing the acrylic polyol can be carried out in volatile organic solvent For example, the initiator can be fed into the solvent at the polymerisation temperature simiiltaneously with the monomer mixture. The volatile organic solvent can be any solvent which will dissolve the acrylic polyol. It can be an aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon such as Solves so 100 (trademark), toluene or xylene, an alcohol such as butanol or isopropenyl, an ester such as butyl acetate or hexyl acetate, a ketone such as methyl isobutyl ketone, methyl ethyl ketone or methyl amyl ketone, an ether, an ether-alcohol or an ether-ester or a mixture of any of these. Preferred solvents are esters and ketones. Particularly preferred solvents are butyl acetate, methyl n-amyl ketone and<br><br>

Typical polymerisation temperatures are 50 to 150°C. Initiators can include for example typical free radical types such as hydrogen peroxide, t-butyl hydroperoxide, di-t-butyl peroxide, di-t-amyl peroxide, butylperoxy-2-ethyl hexanoate, benzoyl peroxide, 2,4-dichlorben2oyl peroxide, t-butylperacetate and 2,2' adobes (2-methylbutyronitrile). Polymerisation initiators are usually added it amounts between about 0.1 and 6% by weight of the monomers polymerised, preferably between 0,5 and 5%.<br>
The compositions of the invention also comprise a base which at least partially neutralises the carboxyl groups on the addition polymer. Ammonia or an amine or mixtures thereof are the preferred bases, while alkali metal hydroxide bases are useful but less preferred. Examples of suitable amines are dimethylethanol amine, 2-amino-2- ' methyl-l"propanol and triethylamine. The amount of base present is such as to be capable of neutralising 0.035 to 0.2 moles of carboxyl groups per kilogram of pinfold, preferably 0.035 to 0.15 moles, more preferably 0.06 to 0.09 moles.<br>

Preferred polyisocyanates are isocyanurate trimers of hexamethylene diisocyanate and the reaction product of trimethylol propane and 4,4'-diplienyhnethane diisocyanate available as Cynthiana 3174 from Cytec Industries.<br>
Polyisocyanate crcsslinkers are preferably used in an amoimt such that the ratio of isocyanate groups to hydroxyl groups is in the range 0.8:1 to 2:1,<br>
In addition to the polyisocyanate, the second component can contain volatile organic solvent This can be any solvent free from ftmctional groups that will react with the isocyanate groups and which will dissolve the polyisocyanate.
