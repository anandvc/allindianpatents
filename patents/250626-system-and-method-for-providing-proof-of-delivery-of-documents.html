				<td>SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR PROVIDING PROOF OF DELIVERY OF DOCUMENTS<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
According to the system and method of the present<br>
invention, evidence is provided of an attempt to deliver<br>
important documents sent by mail, courier or electronic<br>
mailing by providing proof of the date, subject matter and<br>
complete copies of the documents being forwarded to an<br>
intended recipient.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Important documents, such as tax returns, notices<br>
and checks are usually sent with a return receipt requested,<br>
which is confirmation that a letter was received. However,<br>
acknowledgment that something was received, such as a sealed<br>
letter, is not proof as to the contents of the letter.<br>
There is therefore a substantial need for proof of<br>
delivery for the contents of a mailing. This would require<br>
that a copy be reproduced or provided of a handwritten,<br>
typed, printed or electronic material forwarded to another<br>
party.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The following describes the method and procedures<br>
for establishing proof of delivery to a mail delivery<br>
service, such as the post office or a courier service, for<br>
example.<br>
For this part of the description it is assumed that<br>
just one check is to be sent with a cover page, to which the<br>
check is attached. The cover page provides the pertinent<br>
information regarding the purpose of the check, e.g., the<br>
name of the sender, invoice number, amount being transmitted,<br>
a<br>
reference to any document, such as a tax return or real estate<br>
tax, etc. More than one type of form for this information may<br>
be offered to the sender, e.g., a form which is customized for<br>
such matters as an income tax return, or an invoice for a payment<br>
of a bill, or a bill that is a payment which is required<br>
periodically, e.g., a mortgage payment.<br>
The cover page would include a transparent pouch. The<br>
pouch would be so designed that the user could insert the check<br>
and identifying indicia being sent into the pouch. The pouch<br>
permits a copy to be made of the check and cover page, that is,<br>
while the cover page is moving past a copy device. The check or<br>
the pouch would not interfere with the operation of the copy<br>
device.<br>
The cover page would have a designated space for the<br>
name and address of the sender and also for the recipient. There<br>
would be a separate space on the pouch to write and attach<br>
additional information.<br>
The cover page would then be taken to a secure, sealed<br>
delivery box. The cover page would be fed into a slot in the box<br>
by the sender. This slot provides access to a copy device<br>
contained in the box. Once the sender places the cover page into<br>
the slot, the cover page cannot be retrieved by the sender. This<br>
provides additional certainty that the original documents sent<br>
are the same as that which are received.<br>
After being placed into the slot, a conveyor device<br>
would cause the cover sheet to move past the copy device. The<br>
slot, the conveyor mechanism that causes the cover page to move<br>
and the copy device are similar to that found on a typical copy<br>
machine, a fax machine or automatic document fed scanner.<br>
A copy of the cover page would be made by the copy<br>
machine and delivered from an exit port to the sender of the<br>
cover page. This would be one part of the proof for the sender<br>
that the document was sent. In addition to receiving this copy<br>
the sender may request that an electronic copy (an "e-mail") be<br>
sent to at least one of the intended recipient, which would<br>
inform the recipient that the check and cover page have been<br>
sent, to the sender as confirmation of sending and to the<br>
custodian of the delivery box to ensure against tampering or<br>
fraud. The sender may also request that the recipient notify the<br>
sender and the carrier if the cover page is not received.<br>
The carrier of the document which controls the delivery<br>
box would also keep a record of all transactions by recording<br>
them on tape and/or storing them digitally and/or sending an e-<br>
mail confirmation of the transaction to an electronic storage<br>
device of the carrier. This would help protect the carrier<br>
against charges of mishandling the transaction.<br>
After the electronic copy is made, a conveyor mechanism<br>
causes the cover page (if not suitable to be mailed in its<br>
present form) to move into an envelope or to be enclosed by a top<br>
sheet and a bottom sheet so that an envelope is formed around the<br>
cover page. An opening or a transparent section is provided in<br>
the envelope or on the top sheet so that the name and address of<br>
the sender and of the recipient are visible. The addresses could<br>
have been written or typed on the cover page by an external<br>
keyboard and monitor forming part of an exterior of the delivery<br>
box.<br>
Alternatively, the copy machine would select a delivery<br>
box/package based upon the total number of pages being<br>
transmitted. The stacked pages of the original document would<br>
be conveyed into the selected box with delivery and return<br>
address information printed on the top of the box as entered from<br>
the external keyboard.<br>
Alternatively, the pouch or envelope may be transparent<br>
on one side and the address and name of the sender and recipient<br>
may be written or typed on the other side. After the electronic<br>
copy is made of both sides, the pouch or envelope can be caused<br>
to fold and sealed closed in the folded position as it passes<br>
over the conveyor so that the information on the transparent side<br>
is kept private.<br>
The user can press a series of buttons or the keyboard<br>
on the exterior of the delivery box into which the cover page was<br>
placed to key in different types of information. This gives the<br>
sender the opportunity to type the name and address of the sender<br>
and the recipient and indicate the type of delivery desired,<br>
e.g., standard overnight, priority overnight, Saturday, Sunday,<br>
holiday, with or without a return receipt.<br>
A method of payment would be included in the delivery<br>
box, such as a credit card reader. The user would insert their<br>
credit card, and then, based upon the type of delivery selected<br>
and the area code of the recipient, which the user could enter<br>
by pressing a numeric key pad of the keyboard on the delivery box<br>
or be read automatically from the deposited documents by a<br>
scanner. An appropriate charge would be made to the credit card.<br>
Upon request, a receipt would automatically be issued.<br>
A cash receiving machine could also be attached to the<br>
delivery box for payment by cash. Similarly, a receipt would be<br>
issued.<br>
A plurality of pages may be included in the document<br>
sent to the recipient. This would be done by sending the pages<br>
electronically ("e-mail") or by sending the originals of a series<br>
of pages after they are copied on the copy machine. An envelope<br>
may be fed to the copy machine inside the delivery box so that<br>
the series of original pages and the series of copied pages are<br>
placed in separate envelopes. A shipping label may be typed on<br>
the keyboard outside of the delivery box. Also, a check may be<br>
sent through the mail with proof given to the sender by a copy<br>
of the check inserted in the delivery box or proof of mailing of<br>
a check may be sent electronically by the sender to an intended<br>
recipient.<br>
The sender may satisfy the carrier that funds are in<br>
his account in advance of the transaction or during the<br>
transaction. The sender could then direct the carrier to move<br>
those funds from the sender's account to the recipient's account<br>
or the sender may (by the input of an I.D. card and "pin"<br>
numbers) cause a payment to move from the sender's bank account<br>
to the recipient's bank account. It is intended that this<br>
sophisticated method of making a payment in a secure electronic<br>
manner would be made available to people at a public place, such<br>
as a post office or a commercial carrier's facility.<br>
In the above description the "carrier" referred to<br>
above is the party providing the secure delivery box described<br>
above, the facility where it is made available to the sender, and<br>
is also making the delivery of the document to the recipient, a<br>
copy to the sender and to the carrier's own electronic storage<br>
device as proof of receipt of certain documents. Of course,<br>
there may be more than one party involved in the duties described<br>
for the "carrier".<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention<br>
to provide a record of a document being transmitted to a receiver<br>
so as to provide proof to the sender of transmission of the<br>
document.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to<br>
provide a record of a document being transmitted to a receiver<br>
so as to provide proof of transmission of the document by<br>
delivery of the to be transmitted document to a secure delivery<br>
box which provides a copy of all documents being transmitted to<br>
the sender and/or the recipient and/or the service provider of<br>
the delivery box.<br>
It is yet another object of the present invention to<br>
provide a record of a document being transmitted to a receiver<br>
so as to provide proof of transmission of the document by<br>
delivery of the to be transmitted document to a secure delivery<br>
box which provides a copy of all documents being transmitted to<br>
the sender and/or the recipient and/or the service provider of<br>
the delivery box by a hard paper copy or soft electronic copy of<br>
the documents inserted into the delivery box.<br>
It is still yet another object of the present invention<br>
to provide a record of a document being transmitted to a receiver<br>
so as to provide proof of transmission of the document by<br>
delivery of the to be transmitted document to a secure delivery<br>
box which provides a copy of all documents being transmitted to<br>
the sender and/or the recipient and/or the service provider of<br>
the delivery box by a hard copy or electronic copy of the<br>
documents inserted into the delivery box with the sender's<br>
address being visible through a transparent window of the to be<br>
delivered document or entered by an external keyboard of the<br>
delivery box.<br>
It is still yet another object of the present invention<br>
to provide a record of a document being transmitted to a receiver<br>
so as to provide proof of transmission of the document by<br>
delivery of the to be transmitted document to a secure delivery<br>
box which provides a copy of all documents being transmitted to<br>
the sender and/or the recipient and/or the service provider of<br>
the delivery box by a hard copy or electronic copy of the<br>
documents inserted into the delivery box with the sender's<br>
address being visible through a transparent window of the to be<br>
delivered document or entered by an external keyboard of the<br>
delivery box so that copies and confirmation of delivery of<br>
transmitted documents is achieved.<br>
These and other objects of the invention, as well as<br>
many of the intended advantages thereof, will become more readily<br>
apparent when reference is made to the following description<br>
taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
Brief Description of the Accompanying Drawings<br>
Figure 1 is an end view of the secure delivery box of<br>
the present invention.<br>
Figure 2 is a sectional view taken along line 2-2 of<br>
Figure 1 showing the internal copier/scanner, conveyor mechanism,<br>
lock door and computer control center of the present invention.<br>
Figure 3 is a plan view of an envelope which may be<br>
used to transmit payment information, for example, including a<br>
check which is copied to provide proof of delivery to the<br>
delivery box of a document.<br>
Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
In describing a preferred embodiment of the invention<br>
illustrated in the drawings, specific terminology will be<br>
resorted to for the sake of clarity. However, the invention is<br>
not intended to be limited to the specific terms so selected, and<br>
it is to be understood that each specific term includes all<br>
technical equivalents which operate in a similar manner to<br>
accomplish a similar purpose.<br>
With reference to the drawings, in general, and to<br>
Figures 1 and 2 in particular, a system and method of providing<br>
proof of delivery embodying the teachings of the subject<br>
invention includes a secure delivery box 10. The delivery box<br>
10 is made of steel or other similar material construction so as<br>
to provide a secure environment for its contents. The box 10 may<br>
be anchored to the ground by bolts 12 to ensure against movement<br>
of the box.<br>
As shown in Figure 2, access to the interior of the box<br>
10 may be gained through pivotal doorway 14 for retrieval of<br>
documents to be delivered by a courier service. Additional<br>
openings may be provided for servicing of the interior of the<br>
box. A document to be fed into the interior of the box is<br>
fed into slot 16 located at end 18 of the box. Alternatively,<br>
a plurality of documents 20 as shown in Figure 2 may be fed into<br>
the slot 16 in a direction of arrow 22.<br>
In the embodiment where a single document is fed into<br>
the delivery box 10, reference is made to Figure 3. In Figure<br>
3 exterior envelope 24 surrounds an interior cover page 2 6 having<br>
transparent portion 2 8 for viewing of indicia 3 0 representative<br>
of account information, amount of payment and viewing of check<br>
32 for payment of an invoice, for example.<br>
After entry into slot 16, cover sheet 2 6 may be<br>
transmitted by conveyor 34 to a copy device 36. The copy device<br>
includes a photocopy drum 3 8 or other electronic, digital copying<br>
device as well as a scanning bar 40 for electronically reading<br>
the cover page 2 6 and transmitting a record of the cover sheet,<br>
including indicia 3 0 and check 32 by a CPU 42 in the form of<br>
email. The intended recipients of an email copy of the cover<br>
letter 26 may be input to the CPU by pressing in the direction<br>
of arrow 44 on the keys of keyboard 46. A monitor 48 displays<br>
the information being entered by the keyboard.<br>
As an additional mechanism of proof of delivery of the<br>
cover sheet 2 6 to the delivery box a hard copy 55 of the cover<br>
sheet is processed along path 50 and delivered by exit conveyor<br>
52 to the sender who originally passed the cover sheet through<br>
inlet 16. A copy of the cover sheet is delivered in the<br>
direction of arrow 54 from exit port 56.<br>
Meanwhile, the original cover sheet 26 is passed along<br>
in the direction of path 58. The original cover sheet either<br>
passes into holding compartment 60 to be later accessed through<br>
door 14 by an agent of the carrier or passes into external<br>
envelope 24 which can be printed with a delivery address 62, a<br>
return address 64 and even postage from a postage meter (not<br>
shown). Alternatively, depending on the number of pages of the<br>
copied document, box 66 or 68 may be selected for containing the<br>
original document pages.<br>
Payment for the entire transaction may be made by cash<br>
or credit card fed into payment slot 66. The payment transaction<br>
can be confirmed on the monitor screen 48.. If desired, a record<br>
of the payment of the transaction as well as the entire<br>
transaction may be processed by CPU 42 and a copy printed and<br>
passed along path 50 so as to be retrieved from exit port 56-.<br>
By this system and method, confirmation of delivery to<br>
a secure delivery box is made so that a confirmation of deposit<br>
of at least one document is provided to at least one of the<br>
sender, the recipients and the carrier exercising control over<br>
the deposit box. There can therefore be no question as to what<br>
documentation is being transmitted, as well as a specific date<br>
and time of the deposit.<br>
The foregoing description should be considered as<br>
illustrative only of the principles of the invention. Since<br>
numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those<br>
skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the invention to<br>
the exact construction and operation shown and described, and,<br>
accordingly, all suitable modifications and equivalents may be<br>
resorted to, falling within the scope of the invention.<br>
