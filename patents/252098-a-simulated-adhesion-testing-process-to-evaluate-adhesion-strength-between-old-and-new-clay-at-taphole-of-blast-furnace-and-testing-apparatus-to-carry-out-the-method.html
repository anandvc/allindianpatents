FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to simulated adhesion testing process between old<br>
and new clay mud at taphole of blast furnace and testing apparatus to carry out<br>
the method.<br>
More specifically the present invention relates to evolution of adhesion strength<br>
between old and new clay mud at taphole of blast furnace simulated to blast<br>
furnace conditions.<br><br>
-3-<br>
BACKGRQUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
WITH DIFFICULTIES OF PRIOR ART<br>
Taphole clay is used for purpose of plugging of taphole and discharge of iron and<br>
slag produced inside blast furnace. The mud gun inject or extrude the taphole<br>
clay into taphole of blast furnace where it hardens and block the hot metal and<br>
slag to come out from inside of blast furnace whereas drilling machine drill<br>
taphole clay in order to make hole or path for discharging iron and slag produced<br>
inside blast furnace. The performance of taphole clay is of fundamental<br>
importance to the successful running of a blast furnace. The taphole length,<br>
tapping duration and tapping rate are directly related to uniform furnace<br>
performance. The life of a blast furnace depends largely on the erosion of<br>
refractory lining of the hearth wall. One of the major operating factors that<br>
affect the erosion is metal flow in the hearth, especially, the extent of<br>
circumferential flow near the hearth wall region. The intensity of the<br>
circumferential flow is affected by the taphole length. A longer taphole reduces<br><br>
-4-<br>
the intensity of metal flow in the circumferential region, and reduces the wall<br>
lining erosion. A shorter taphole enhances the circumferential flow and increases<br>
the wall lining erosion. In consequence, the control of the taphole length is<br>
regarded as one of the indispensable measures to achieve longer blast furnace<br>
life. Basically taphole clay is expected to protect hearth side wall by creating<br>
protection layer of clay called mushroom around inside opening of taphole.<br>
Longer taphole length can be achieved only if the injected mud stays at around<br>
the in-furnace taphole opening and sinters there. To achieve the above<br>
condition it is necessary that the clay mud injected by mudgun should adhere<br>
well with the already existing clay mud. A test method has been innovated in<br>
order to measure the adhesion characteristics (strength) between old and new<br>
clay mud developed at high temperature. The present invention has proposed to<br>
enhance Blast Furnace life in a new approach of quantifying adhesion strength<br>
between old and new clay mud at taphole.<br><br>
-5-<br>
Earlier method for checking the adhesion quality of taphole clay involve silicon<br>
carbide crucible, after filling the crucible with taphole clay firing is to be done<br>
under reducing environment at 1450° C for 3 hrs. after cooling, the crucible is cut<br>
into two halves in order to see qualitatively weather taphole clay had stick with<br>
crucible wall or not. Above method of checking adhesion characteristics of<br>
taphole clay is inefficient in terms of differentiating different qualities of taphole<br>
clay adhesion characteristics which seems to be adhered (stick) with crucible side<br>
wall. With this method it is difficult to find out the value of adhesion strength<br>
between old and new taphole clay. Moreover this test method cannot be used to<br>
determine the adhesion characteristics between old and new clay mud. In order<br>
to differentiate adhesion characteristics of different type of taphole clay<br>
quantitative measurement of adhesion strength is necessary.<br><br>
-6-<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to one object of the invention a test method of quantification of<br>
adhesion strength between old and new clay at taphole is proposed.<br>
Another objective of the invention is to predict the performance of taphole clay in<br>
terms of achieving long taphole length in actual blast furnace condition<br>
ascertaining adherence of new taphole clay mud pushed by mud gun into<br>
taphole with the already existing old taphole clay in front of inside opening of<br>
taphole.<br>
The major problem involved in earlier art is its inability to quantify the adhesion<br>
strength, also in earlier art result consist only qualitative observation of adhesion<br>
or sticking behaviors of taphole clay with silicon carbide crucible wall, but in the<br>
proposed invention the objective is to measure the adhesion characteristics<br>
(strength) between old and new clay mud developed at high temperature.<br><br>
-7-<br>
The testing procedure developed according to the invention is best understood<br>
from the following flow chart.<br>
Flow chart of the invented test method:<br><br><br>
-8-<br>
The invention will be better understood from the following description with<br>
reference to accompanying drawings in which<br>
Figure 1       shows a compact old clay sample by Marshal Load Test equipment.<br>
Figure 2       shows the drilled clay sample after firing at required temperature.<br>
Figure 3       shows schematically ejection of new clay from the old clay<br>
in CCS Machine to determine adhesion strength.<br>
Figure 4       shows Marshal Load Test Equipment.<br>
In the test method according to the invention a cylindrical shaped compact clay<br>
sample (1) is first prepared form Marshal Load test equipment (basically it is a<br>
simulation test of mud-gun taphofe clay pushing process) and is first Fired at<br>
around 1300 ~ 1500° C and soaked for some specified time (say 2-5 hr) under<br>
reducing environment. After firing, a hole (25~ 50 mm dia.) (2) is drilled<br><br>
-9-<br>
through the center of clay sample. After filling drilled hole with new taphole clay<br>
mud (4) the sample is again fired at around 1300 ~ 1500° C and soaked for<br>
some specified time (say 2-5 hr). In order to quantify the adhesion strength<br>
between newly filled taphole clay and cylindrical shaped already fired old taphole<br>
clay, a load is applied with the help of cold crushing strength (CCS) equipment<br>
only on new clay mud which had been filled in drilled hole. Adhesion strength<br>
(value) is the maximum load at which new clay mud starts to extrude out from<br>
old clay mud. Figure 3 shows the way load is applied only on new taphole clay<br>
mud with the help of CCS machine. In Figure 3, plunger (8) exerts pressure on<br>
the new clay (4) filled in the hole of compact old clay sample (1), numeral (6)<br>
showing the base of the CCS machine. Thus the new method not only solves the<br>
purpose of quantification of adhesion strength as well as involves clay-to-clay<br>
direct adhesion.<br><br>
-10-<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE<br>
INVENTION WITH ILLUSTRATION<br>
The main objective of new testing method is to simulate the actual blast furnace<br>
condition as much as possible. In actual blast furnace condition first, taphole<br>
clay mass is fed into the barrel of mudgun, where generally temperature lies<br>
around 60 -70° C and consequently it is pushed by piston of mudgun in dense<br>
compact form into blast furnace taphole.<br>
In Order to simulate above condition in lab, 1 kg of taphole clay sample is kept in<br>
the oven where temperature lies around 60° C for one hour. After taking out<br>
from oven the sample (1) is kept in the pre-1 ubricated mould of marshal load test<br>
equipment (Figure 4 shows Marshall load test equipment) then the plunger (3) of<br>
Marshal Load test Equipment is placed vertically above the clay sample (1) and<br>
pressure applied slowly with the help of hydraulically operated piston. At a<br>
certain pressure (depends on plasticity of taphole clay) clay sample starts to<br><br>
-11-<br>
extrude out from mould nozzle and forms compact cylindrical shaped sample.<br>
Dial gauge (7) of Marshal Load test equipment shows the pressure at which clay<br>
sample starts to extrude out from mould nozzle. Figure 1 shows the cylindrical<br>
shape clay sample (1) obtained from Marshal Load test equipment. This<br>
cylindrical shaped clay sample is then kept in atmospheric controlled furnace<br>
under reducing environment and fired at around 1300~ 1500° C and soaked for<br>
some specified time (say 2-5 hr.). After cooling this fired sample, a hole (2)<br>
(25~50 mm dia.) is drilled through the center of sample.<br>
Figure 2 shows drilled taphole clay sample. This drilled hole (2) is filled with the<br>
new taphole clay of same quality, preheated at 60° C to 70° C for one hour in the<br>
oven. The whole arrangement is kept inside atmospheric controlled furnace<br>
under reducing environment and fired at around 1300~1500° C and soaked for<br>
some specified time (say 2-5 hr).<br><br>
-12-<br>
After taking out the above sample from furnace the hole filled up sample is kept<br>
on cold crushing strength machine as shown in Figure 3. Then the load is<br>
applied with the help of CCS machine through plunger (8) only on clay sample<br>
filled in drilled hole. Maximum load at which new clay mud starts to extrude out<br>
from cylindrically shaped old clay mud gives adhesion strength of particular<br>
quality of taphole clay.<br>
The invention as narrated herein should not be read and construed in a<br>
restrictive manner as various modifications, alterations of dimensions of sample<br>
and test conditions and adaptations are possible within the scope and ambit of<br>
the invention as defined in the encompassed appended claims.<br><br>
