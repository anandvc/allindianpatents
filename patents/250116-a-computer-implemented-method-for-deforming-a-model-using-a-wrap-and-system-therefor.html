				<td>Background of the Invention<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] This invention relates generally to computer graphics and, more specifically, to<br>
wrap deforming a model using subdivision surfaces.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002] Computers are widely used to model figures, from insects and monsters to human<br>
beings. The basic view of a figure is known as a model. Creating a model requires a lot of time<br>
and effort on the part of a user. In general, a user creates a model by scanning in a three -<br>
dimensional sculpture or by creating a model by hand based on a traditional two -dimensional<br>
drawing. Frequently, a computer-generated (CG) model is represented mathematically by one or<br>
more parametric surfaces. A CG model usually comprises a large number of parametric surfaces<br>
connected together. A parametric surface is a description of a two-dimensional object in three -<br>
dimensional space where every point on the parametric surface can be mapped to a pair of<br>
parameters (u, v). Many types of parametric surfaces are used in CG modeling, such as NURBS<br>
(Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines) surfaces and subdivision surfaces (the latter having a non -<br>
trivial parameterization).<br>
[0003] A parametric surface has a set of control points (also known as control vertices or<br>
"CVs") that define the shape of the surface. When a CV is moved, the surface that is defined by<br>
the CV deforms into a new shape. Thus, a user can change the shape of a model by moving the<br>
CVs that define the model's surfaces. In order to deform a model to a particular shape, a user<br>
often must move a large number of CVs, due to the natural constraints of parametric surfaces.<br>
Moving large numbers of CVs directly, one by one, is time-consuming and not very intuitive.<br>
Instead, users manipulate CVs programmatically through the use of a deformation algorithm<br>
("deformer"). A deformer enables an animator to move CVs indirectly by using a simpler<br>
interface.<br>
[00041 Many types of deformers exist such as, for example, blendshape s, clusters, and<br>
free-form deformers. Free-form deformers partition space into discrete cells. One type of free -<br>
form deformer, a lattice, comprises surrounding a model with a polygonal cubic mesh that is<br>
partitioned into a relatively large number of divisi ons in x, y, and z (hence the name "lattice").<br>
The lattice surrounds the model in such a way that each of the model's CVs falls inside one cell<br>
of the lattice. As the user moves the vertices of the lattice, the cells of the lattice are deformed,<br>
and the CVs located inside the cells get transformed according to a local affine transformation,<br>
eventually placing the CVs in new locations. In this way, a relatively low- resolution lattice can<br>
be used to create broad deformation on a high- resolution model.<br>
[0005] Another type of free-form deformer, a wrap deformer, is similar to a lattice but<br>
uses an arbitrary polygonal mesh of free topology rather than a lattice mesh. The polygonal<br>
mesh, also known as a polywrap, wrap, or cage, acts as a binding domain for the model, such<br>
that the model is bound to the wrap. This binding transmits deformations of the wrap's vertices<br>
to the CVs of the model, thereby deforming the model itself. Deformations of the wrap's vertices<br>
can affect the model's CVs in a variety of ways. One family of wrap deformers creates small<br>
cells in the space surrounded by the wrap and associates the cells with the CVs of a model. The<br>
problem with this type of wrap deformer is that it doesn't scale well with the size of the model.<br>
Large models at high resolution may require a huge number of cells, and the evaluation and<br>
update process of the deformer is very slow and consumes a lot of memory. Conversely, using a<br>
smaller number of cells will introduce discretization artifacts in the model during deformation.<br>
This type of wrap deformer is further described in "Free- form Deformations with Lattices of<br>
Arbitrary Topology" by R. MacCracken and K. Joy, Proceedings of the 23rd International<br>
Conference on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques, 1996, pp. 181-190.<br>
[0006] Another family of wrap deformers associates the CVs of a model with certain<br>
CVs on the wrap. The motion of the model's CVs is then defined as a weighted linear<br>
combination of the motions of the wrap's CVs. This approach is faster than the space cell<br>
division approach mentioned above; however, it suffers from many problems and artifacts due to<br>
the simplistic nature of the linear interpolation scheme.<br>
[00071 A wrap can be located either inside or outside of a model. When a wrap is located<br>
inside a model, it acts like a skeleton. As the underlying skeleton changes, the outer layer (the<br>
model) changes also. When a wrap is located outside of a model, it acts like a pupp eteer with<br>
strings connecting the wrap to the model. As the wrap is deformed, the strings pull on the model<br>
and thereby deform the model.<br>
[0008] In order to animate a model, it is necessary to create additional images that show<br>
the model in various poses corresponding to stages of a movement. Each of these images is<br>
identical to the model except for slight differences. For example, the model may have its mouth<br>
closed, while additional images show the model's mouth opening over time. Many images must<br>
be created in order to animate a detailed model. Creating each image by manually editing each<br>
CV of the model is nearly impossible. Not only does it require a great deal of work, it also does<br>
not result in a convincing performance for the animated model because of the a wkwardness of<br>
the interface.<br>
[0009] Instead, animators use software "rigs" to pose models as if they were puppets. A<br>
rig is a set of joints, skeletons, and deformers that attach to a model. Rigs provide the<br>
"machinery" that enables users to animate models. A rig comprises computer modules and<br>
interfaces that enable an animator to move the CVs of the model indirectly, via a much simpler<br>
interface. For example, a rig enables an animator to select a part of a model, such as an eyebrow<br>
or a lip, and use simple user interface widgets, such as buttons and sliders, to move that part of<br>
the model.<br>
[0010] Existing wrap deformation software, such as Maya® from Alias Systems and<br>
SOFTIMAGE®|3D from Avid Technology, Inc., has several disadvantages. One disadvantage is<br>
that deformations of the wrap result in excessive linear interpolation artifacts in the model. The<br>
changes made to the wrap are often discontinuous due to the wrap's lack of resolution, and these<br>
discontinuities end up getting transferred to the model. These artifacts are most noticeable when<br>
there is a significant difference between the resolution of the wrap and the resolution of the<br>
model. This situation is common because wraps are usually low-resolution (not continuous),<br>
whereas models are usually high-resolution (continuous). FIG. 1 shows an example of<br>
discontinuities created by wrap deforming a model using prior art software. Here, the wrap 100<br>
is a low-resolution polygonal mesh and the model 110 is a higher-resolution NURBS (Non-<br>
Uniform Rational B-Splines) plane. FIG. 1 shows the effect on the model 110 of raising the<br>
second row of control vertices in the wrap 100. The artifacts indicate problems with the cell<br>
splitting of the polygonal mesh wrap and problems with the weighted contributions of the wrap<br>
on the control vertices of the model.<br>
[0011] Another disadvantage of prior art software is that it is slow. The slowness is<br>
severe enough to make wrap deformation inadequate for character setup purposes. For example,<br>
it cannot be used for sculpting new blendshapes from existing models, unless the models are very<br>
small and not detailed. When existing software is used to wrap deform a detailed, realistic model,<br>
it runs so slowly that it is virtually unusable for modeling and animation. Since free- form<br>
deformers partition space into discrete cells, the calculations they perform require 0(n3) time,<br>
where n is the number of cells.<br>
[0012] What is needed is a way to wrap deform a model that results in fewer<br>
discontinuities and artifacts and is fast enough to be used for modeling realistic characters and<br>
animating characters using rigs.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
[0013] The present invention overcomes the limitations of the prior art by using a<br>
subdivision surface as a binding domain to wrap deform a model. A subdivision surface is<br>
derived from a wrap that has been associated with a model. The subdivision surface is bound to<br>
the model by associating points on the subdivision surface with control vertices of the model. In<br>
response to a change in the position of a control vertex of the wrap, the subdivision surface is<br>
redetermined, and the updated surface locations are used to redetermine the position of the<br>
model's control vertices, thereby deforming the model.<br>
[0014] In one embodiment, the model and wrap are input into a software component<br>
called a polywrap deformation engine. The deformation engine creates a subdivision surface<br>
based on the wrap. The deformation engine then binds the model to the subdivision surface.<br>
When the wrap is deformed, the subdivision surface is recalculated. The model is then deformed<br>
based on the recalculated subdivision surface and the binding between the subdivision surface<br>
and the model.<br>
[0015] Using the polywrap deformation engine to wrap deform a model minimizes the<br>
introduction of linear artifacts during the deformation process. This is because the model and the<br>
subdivision surface to which it is bound have similar resolutions. The deformation engine can<br>
also be used with binding parameters assigned to control vertices in the wrap. The values of<br>
these parameters are propagated to the subdivision surface and affect the deformation of the<br>
model. Thus, usage of a subdivision surface enables both positional continuity and continuity in<br>
values of binding parameters.<br>
[0016] The present invention may be embothed in various forms. In one embodiment, the<br>
present invention is a computer-implemented methodology for deforming a model using<br>
subdivision surfaces. Another embodiment provides a software architecture; yet another<br>
embodiment is a computer system which performs the subdivision method. Another aspect of the<br>
invention is the data representation of a model in combination with subdivision surfaces as stored<br>
in a computer-readable medium. The present invention also has embodiments as computer<br>
program products for carrying out the subdivision method.<br>

Detailed Descriptions of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
[0034] FIG. 2 illustrates a block diagram overview of the use of one embodiment of a<br>
software component for wrap deforming a model. FIG. 2 includes a polywrap deformation<br>
engine 200, a model 210, a wrap 220, and a deformed model 230. Polywrap deformation engine<br>
200 is a software component used to wrap deform a model 210. The inputs of the deformation<br>
engine 200 are a model 210 and a wrap 220. The output of the deformation engine 200 is a<br>
deformed model 230. After a user is satisfied with the deformed model 230, the deformed model<br>
230 is further processed in order to add special effects such as lightin g and shadows. For<br>
example, the deformed model 230 may be input into a rendering engine (not shown).<br>
[0035] One of the inputs to polywrap deformation engine 200 is a model 210. The model<br>
210 is the figure that will be deformed. The model 210 may be built using a variety of methods<br>
known to those skilled in the art, such as scanning in a three-dimensional sculpture or creating a<br>
model from scratch based on a traditional two-dimensional drawing using a computer graphics<br>
product such as Maya® from Alias Systems. The model 210 may be, for example, a NURBS<br>
(Non-Uniform Rational B -Splines) surface, a subdivision surface, a curve, a polygonal mesh, or<br>
a combination of the above.<br>
[0036] The other input to the polywrap deformation engine 200 is a wrap 220. The wrap<br>
220 is used to deform the model 210. The wrap 220 may be built using a variety of methods<br>
known to those skilled in the art, such as scanning in a model or creating a wrap from scratch<br>
using a computer graphics product such as Maya® from Alias Systems. Preferably, the wr ap 220<br>
is a polygonal mesh.<br>
[0037] FIG. 3 illustrates a flowchart of a method for wrap deforming a model according<br>
to one embodiment of the invention. Polywrap d eformation engine 200 performs wrap<br>
deformation using a subdivision surface. A subdivision surface is a high- resolution surface<br>
calculated based on a polygonal mesh of arbitrary topology. The lower-resolution mesh is<br>
iteratively subdivided and refined until it becomes a high-resolution surface. Examples of this<br>
process will be discussed below. Subdivision surfaces are C2 continuous (i.e., their second<br>
derivatives are continuous) in the limit of infinite refinement (i.e., after an infinite number of<br>
subdivisions). The "subdivision surface" tha t is bound to the model 210 in this embodiment,<br>
which is called the "subdivision mesh," is a finite resolution representation of the limit surface.<br>
Although the subdivision mesh is of finite resolution, the points within it are located within the<br>
limit subdivision surface. Subdivision surfaces are further described in handouts distributed at<br>
Course 23: Subdivision for Modeling and Animation at the 27th International Conference on<br>
Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques, New Orleans, Louisiana, 2000.<br>
[0038] How well the subdivision mesh approximates the limit subdivision surface<br>
depends on how many times the mesh has been subdivided. Each time the mesh gets subdivided,<br>
the resolution of its surface increases. In the limit, the resolution approaches that of a subdivision<br>
surface. In one embodiment, the user may control the number of division refinements applied to<br>
the initial wrap 220 by adjusting the value of the "subdivision level" parameter. The larger the<br>
value, the more times the wrap 220 will be subdivided and the higher the sampling of the limit<br>
subdivision surface. FIGS. 4A and 4B illustrate the effect of the value of the subdivision level<br>
parameter. FIGS. 4A and 4B each illustrate a polygonal mesh wrap 220, a NURBS sphere model<br>
210, and a subdivision mesh 400 formed from the wrap 220 . The subdivision mesh 400A in FIG.<br>
4A was formed from a wrap 220 using a lower subdivision level parameter value than was used<br>
to form the subdivision mesh 400B in FIG. 4B. As a result, the subdivision mesh 400B has more<br>
binding sites and will provide a better deformation resolution .<br>
[0039] There are many methods for calculating a subdivision surface. FIGS. 5A-5C<br>
illustrate subdivision using the Loop algorithm. In order to use this algorithm, the original<br>
surface 500 should be a triangular mesh. If the wrap 220 that was input into the polywrap<br>
deformation engine 200 is not a triangular mesh, the wrap 220 can be converted into a triangular<br>
mesh by using a triangulation algorithm such as the Delaunay algorithm. The Delaunay<br>
algorithm is further described in "Primitives for the Manipulation of General Subdivisions and<br>
the Computation of Voronoi Diagrams" by L. Guibas and J. Stolfi, ACM Transactions on<br>
Graphics, Vol.4 No. 2, April 1985, pp. 74-123.<br>
[0040] FIG. 5A illustrates an original surface 500 (here, a two -dimensional triangular<br>
mesh) before Loop subdivision. In the first step, a new vertex ("edge point") 505 is placed on<br>
each original edge 510 in the mesh 500 at a location that is a weighted average. FIG. 5B<br>
illustrates the original surface 500 with the new edge points 505. Each original vertex is then<br>
moved to a new weighted location based on its original position and the new edge points.<br>
Finally, new edges 515 are added to connect each new edge point 505 to its adjacent edge points<br>
505. FIG. 5C illustrates the subdivided surface, which is the original surface 500 with the edge<br>
points 505 and new edges 515. The result is that each triangular face in the original mesh 500<br>
divides into four triangular faces. The resulting mesh is then smoothed based on the centroids of<br>
the new faces. The Loop algorithm is described further in "Smooth Subdivision Surfaces Based<br>
on Triangles" by C. T. Loop, Master's thesis, University of Utah, Department of Mathematics,<br>
1987.<br>
[0041] FIGS. 6A-6D illustrate subdivision using the Catmull-Clark algorithm. Unlike the<br>
Loop algorithm, the Catmull-Clark algorithm can be used with any arbitrary mesh, as long as it is<br>
a manifold. FIG. 6A illustrates an original surface 600 (here, a two-di mensional square mesh)<br>
before Catmull-Clark subdivision. In the first step, a new vertex ("face point") 605 is placed at<br>
the center of each face 610 in the original surface 600. FIG. 6B illustrates the original surface<br>
600 with the new face points 605. Then, a new vertex ("edge point") 615 is placed on each<br>
original edge 620 in the mesh 600 at a location that is a weighted average of the center of the<br>
edge 620 and the surrounding new face points 605 . FIG. 6C illustrates the original surface 600<br>
with the face points 605 and the new edge points 615. New edges 625 are then added to connect<br>
each new edge point 615 to its adjacent face points 605. Each vertex in the original surface 600<br>
is then placed at a new position that is a weighted average based on the vertex's surrounding new<br>
face points 605 and new edge points 615. FIG. 6D illustrates the subdivided surface, which is the<br>
original surface 600 with the face points 605, edge points 615, and new edges 625. The result is<br>
that each square face 610 in the original mesh 600 divides into four square faces. The resulting<br>
mesh is then smoothed based on the centroids of the new faces. The Catmull-Clark algorithm is<br>
described further in "Recursively Generated B- Spline Surfaces on Arbitrary Topological<br>
Meshes" by E. Catmull and J. Clark, Computer- Aided Design, 10(6), pp.350-355, November<br>
1978.<br>
[0042] Instead of using a polygonal mesh wrap 220 as the binding domain for the model<br>
210, as in the prior art, polywrap deformation engine 200 uses a subdivision surface as the<br>
binding domain. Recall that traditional wrap deformation, where a model 210 is bound to a<br>
polygonal mesh wrap 220, introduces discontinuities into the model 210 because of the<br>
significant difference between the resolution of the wrap 220 and the resolution of the model<br>
210. Unlike polygonal meshes, subdivision surfaces have arbitrarily high resolutions. Thus,<br>
when a high-resolution model 210 is wrap deformed by a subdivision surface, fewer<br>
discontinuities are introduced into the model 210.<br>
[0043] However, a subdivision surface is generally not deformed directly. Recall that a<br>
subdivision surface is calculated based on a lower- resolution mesh. Thus, polywrap deformation<br>
engine 200 calculates a subdivision mesh 400 based on the wrap 220 and then binds the model<br>
210 to the subdivision mesh 400. The subdivision mesh 400 thereby acts as a proxy, conveying<br>
deformation information from the wrap 220 to the model 210. Since the subdivision mesh 400 is<br>
calculated based on the wrap 220, any deformation in the wrap 220 is automatically propagated<br>
to the subdivision mesh 400. The deformation of the subdivision mesh 400 is then propagated to<br>
the model 210 because of the binding between the model 210 and the subdivision mesh 400.<br>
[0044] In other words, discontinuous changes in the wrap 220 get transformed in to<br>
smooth and continuous changes on the subdivision surface . As a result, binding a model 210 to a<br>
subdivision surface and then deforming the subdivision surface does not introduce as many<br>
discontinuities into the model 210. The result is that fewer discon tinuities are introduced into the<br>
model 210 during the wrap deformation process.<br>
[0045J As discussed above, the closer in resolution the model and subdivision mesh are,<br>
the fewer discontinuities are introduced during the deformation process. When there is a large<br>
difference between the resolution of the wrap and the resolution of the model, it is beneficial to<br>
use a high subdivision level to increase the resolution of the subdivision mesh in order to obtain<br>
a more accurate binding. If the resolution difference is small, then a low subdivision level should<br>
be sufficient.<br>
[0046] For simplicity purposes, the invention will be described in an embodiment for<br>
deforming a NURBS model 210, for example a sphere, using a polygonal cube mesh as a wrap<br>
220. However, the invention may be used to deform a model of any shape or to deform groups of<br>
shapes. Similarly, the wrap may be any shape. FIG. 7 illustrates a polygonal cube mesh<br>
surrounding a NURBS sphere model. FIG. 7 also illustrates several CVs 700 of the model 210.<br>
[0047| When method 300 begins, a model 210 and a wrap 220 have been input into the<br>
polywrap deformation engine 200. The first step of method 300 is to calculate 310 a subdivision<br>
mesh based on the wrap 220, using any of the methods discussed above. In general, Catmull-<br>
Clark subdivision is helpful when deforming NURBS models, since Catmull-Clark subdivision<br>
surfaces and NURBS are similar in topology. Loop subdivision is helpful when deforming cloth<br>
simulations, since cloth and other dynamic simulations frequently use triangulated meshes,<br>
which have a similar topology to Loop subdivision surfaces. Although the polygonal cube mesh<br>
has discontinuities on its surface, the subdivision algorithm transforms it into a smooth,<br>
continuous surface (in the limit). Since the vertices in the subdivision mesh are located in the<br>
limit subdivision surface, artifacts deriving from the finite subdivision of the polygonal mesh are<br>
avoided.<br>
[0048] FIG. 8 illustrates a polygonal cube mesh surrounding a NURBS sphere model and<br>
the cube mesh's subdivision mesh, calculated using the Loop algorithm. Once the deformation<br>
engine 200 has calculated 310 the subdivision mesh 400 based on the wrap 220, the polywrap<br>
deformation engine 200 binds 320 the model 210 to the subdivision mesh 400 (the binding<br>
domain). The binding domain comprises a number of binding sites to which the CV s 700 of the<br>
model 210 are bound. Since the subdivision mesh 400 is a finite resolution representation of the<br>
subdivision limit surface, there are a finite number of binding sites on the subdivision mesh 400.<br>
In one embodiment, the number o f binding sites on the subdivision mesh 400 is controlled by the<br>
subdivision level parameter discussed above.<br>
[0049| Each CV 700 on the model 210 is bound to one binding site on the subdivision<br>
mesh. Alternatively, one CV 700 could be bound to more than one binding site 900, as long as a<br>
normalized weighted averaging of the binding sites on the subdivision surface were defined . In<br>
one embodiment, a CV 700 is bound to the closest binding site; however, many other methods of<br>
binding are also possible. Since a CV of a model 210 is bound to a binding site on the<br>
subdivision mesh 400, the link between them (and thus the link between their deformations) is<br>
surface-based, not volume-based as it is in some prior art.<br>
[0050] Which part of the subdivision mesh 400 is used as the actual binding site depends<br>
on how the subdivision mesh 400 is calculated. FIG. 9 illustrates a binding between a model and<br>
a subdivision mesh formed using the Loop algorithm. Here, a binding site 900 is defined as one<br>
triangular face of the subdivision mesh 400. Each CV (C,) on the model 210 is bound to the<br>
closest binding site 900 of the subdivision mesh 400. In order to determine to which binding site<br>
900 a particular CV 700 is bound, a local reference frame of coordinates is created. Many<br>
choices exist for the local reference frame. In one embodiment, the local reference frame<br>
comprises an origin point O (the center of reference) and three vectors b1, b2, b3. While O can be<br>
any point that lies on the subdivision surface, in o ne embodiment, O is the barycenter (center of<br>
gravity) of the binding site 900. Vector b3 is normal to the subdivision surface and intersects the<br>
subdivision surface at O. Vector b3 is calculated by taking the cross-product of vector b1 and<br>
vector b2. These two vectors go from O to the two nearest consecutive vertices of the binding site<br>
900. If the triangle of the binding site 900 is degenerate, then that binding site is not used. In<br>
FIG. 9, control vertex C0 is bound to the barycenter O of the binding site 900.<br>
[0051] FIG. 10 illustrates a binding between a model and a subdivision mesh formed<br>
using the Catmull-Clark algorithm. In this embodiment, a binding site 900 is defined as a vertex<br>
of the limit subdivision surface. However, many other methods of binding are also possible.<br>
Each CV (C) on the model 210 is bound to the closest vertex of the subdivision mesh 400.<br>
Vectors b1 and b2 are tangent vectors to the limit surface at O. Vector b3 is again defined as the<br>
cross-product of vectors b1 and b2.<br>
[0052] Once the binding site's reference frame {O; bt, b2, bi} has been established, the<br>
binding projection coordinates {,x,,,y„ z,-} of a CV (C,) on the model can be determined. The<br>
binding projection coordinates are the components of the projection of the vector 0-C, onto the<br>
binding site 900. The binding procedure is repeated for each CV in the model 210. Once a<br>
binding has been calculated for each CV in the model 210, the result is a set of local frames of<br>
coordinates (one for each binding site) and the corresponding projections of these coordinates to<br>
the model's control vertices.<br>
[0053] FIG. 11 illustrates the wrap, model, and portions of the subdivision mesh of FIG.<br>
8 in addition to the bindings between the model and the subdivision mesh. Only binding sites<br>
900 that have been bound to CVs 700 on the model 210 are shown. In this embodiment, each CV<br>
on the model was bound to the binding site that contained the nearest barycenter to the CV. FIG.<br>
12 illustrates an enlarged view of a portion of FIG. 11.<br>
[0054] After the polywrap deformation engine 200 has calculated the default bindings<br>
between the model 210 and the subdivision mesh 400, a user can manu ally edit the bindings to<br>
adjust the deformations more precisely in a specific area. Wrap deformers have trouble with<br>
bindings located in tight corners, such as between two fingers or at the corners of mouths and<br>
eyes. In these areas, it is often useful to edit the bindings of a few CVs of the model 210. This<br>
gives the user more control over the binding mechanism between the model 210 and the<br>
subdivision mesh 400. The user can therefore rebind the CVs of the model 210 to different<br>
locations, and the deformation engine 200 will automatically determine new projection<br>
coordinates.<br>
[0055] Once the bindings between the model 210 and the subdivision mesh 400 have<br>
been determined, the binding projection coordinates for each CV 700 of the model 210 are stored<br>
330. These coordinates are later used to transfer deformations of the wrap 220 to the model 210,<br>
as will be discussed below.<br>
[0056] After the binding projection coordinates have been stored 330, the next step is to<br>
deform 340 the wrap 220. The wrap 220 can be deformed 340 in many ways, by either directly<br>
moving its vertices or applying other existing deformers. Since there is only one wrap 220<br>
associated with the deformation engine 200, all changes applied to the wrap 220 transfer a<br>
deformation directly to the model 210. Similarly, any editing of the wrap 220 that causes a<br>
change of the topology of the subdivision mesh 400, such as face extrusion and insert ion and<br>
deletion of edges, triggers a "rebinding" of the model 210 to the wrap 220. Essentially, the<br>
deformation engine 200 detects the topology change, calculates a new subdivision surface and<br>
new binding sites, and reconnects the current state of the model 210 to the subdivision binding<br>
domain. In prior art software, the wrap 220 has two copies, one for the "base" wrap, whic h<br>
defines the binding properties, and another for the "editable" binding wrap. However, prior art<br>
software does not support topological changes to the wrap 220. Users can change only the vertex<br>
positions of the "editable" wrap 220.<br>
[0057] After the wrap 220 has been deformed 340, the next step is to propagate these<br>
changes to the subdivision surface by recalculating the subdivision surface based on the<br>
deformed wrap 220. No matter how the original vertices of the wrap 220 are deformed, the<br>
wrap's subdivision surface always remains smooth and continuous. The recalculation of the<br>
subdivision surface is very fast, much faster than the partitioning of space in three -dimensional<br>
cells that is used by prior art free-form deformers. FIG. 13 illustrates the polygonal cube mesh,<br>
the NURBS sphere model, and the cube mesh's subdivision mesh of FIG. 8 after deformation of<br>
the polygonal cube mesh.<br>
[0058] Recall that the first time that the subdivision surface was calculated (step 310), the<br>
next step was to bind the model 210 to the subd ivision mesh 400. At this point, however, the<br>
model 210 has already been bound to the subdivision mesh 400, and those binding projection<br>
coordinates have been stored. The idea here is to use the recalculated subdivision surface and the<br>
stored bindings to move the CVs 700 of the model 210. Thus, the next step is to deform the<br>
model 210 by calculating 360 new positions of the control vertices 700 of the model 210. As<br>
mentioned above, this calculation is based on the recalculated subdivision surface (and its<br>
associated subdivision mesh 400), the stored binding projection coordinates, and any binding<br>
parameters.<br>
[0059] Since the recalculated subdivision surface has the same resolution as the original<br>
subdivision surface, it has the same number of binding sites 900. However, the reference frame<br>
{O; b1, b2, b3} of each binding site 900 is affected, since the location of O and the orientation of<br>
b1, b2, b3 are translated due to the deformation. In contrast, the binding projection coordinates of<br>
each CV 700 of the model 210 remain constant. The original binding coordinates and the new<br>
reference frame, along with the binding parameters discussed below, enable the prediction of the<br>
new location of a CV 700 on the model 210.<br>
[0060] Binding parameters may include, for example, radius o f influence, weighting, and<br>
blending. While binding parameter values are originally set for a wrap 220, these values are<br>
propagated to the subdivision surface based on the wrap 220. Since the subdivision surface is<br>
continuous, the parameter value changes over the subdivision surface are also continuous, and<br>
this continuity extends to the model 210. Parameter continuity in the model enables a smoother<br>
animation of the underlying model 210, thereby creating a more nuanced performance by the<br>
animated character. Thus, usage of a subdivision surface enables both positional continuity and<br>
continuity in binding parameters.<br>
[0061] The radius of influence parameter affects a binding site 900, and its value can be<br>
set by default or specified by a user. The value of the radius of influence parameter indicates<br>
which CVs 700 of the model 210 can be bound to the binding site 900. Any CV 700 that is<br>
farther away from the binding site 900 than the parameter value will not be bound to the binding<br>
site 900.<br>
[0062] FIGS. 14A, 14B, and 14C illustrate the effect on a model of the value of the<br>
radius of influence binding parameter. FIGS. 14A, 14B, and 14C each illustrate a polygonal<br>
plane mesh 220 and a NURBS plane model 210. In FIG. 14A, the wrap 220 and the model 210<br>
are in their original positions. In FIGS. 14B and 14C, two rows of the wrap 220 have been<br>
translated vertically, resulting a deformation of the model 210. The deformation of the model<br>
210 in FIG. 14B was formed from a wrap 220 having a higher radius of influence binding<br>
parameter value than the wrap 220 used to deform the model 210 in FIG. 14C. As a result, the<br>
deformation in the model 210 in FIG. 14C is more localized.<br>
[0063] The radius of influence parameter changes the bindings between the wrap 220 and<br>
the model 210, as shown more clearly by FIGS. 15A and 15B. FIGS. 15A and 15B illustrate the<br>
effect on the bindings between a wrap and a model of the value of the radius of influence binding<br>
parameter. FIGS. 15A and 15B illustrate the same wraps 220 and models 210 as in FIGS. 14B<br>
and 14C, respectively, as well as the bindings 1500 between the wraps 220 and models 210. As<br>
illustrated, the bindings 1500 in FIG. 15A extend further from the wrap 220 to more distant parts<br>
of the model 210 than do the bindings 1500 in FIG. 15B.<br>
[0064] Another parameter is rate of deformation, also known as weighting. In general, all<br>
points in a wrap 220 deform the underlying model 210 with the same strength. However, a user<br>
may want to vary how strongly a given control vertex or group of control vertices of the wrap<br>
220 affects (pushes or pulls) the model 210. This can be achieved by assigning a weight to the<br>
vertex of the wrap 220. The greater the weight, the stronger the effect of the control vertex on the<br>
model 210. If weights are assigned to the wrap 220, the wrap 220 can be used again with a<br>
different model 210 to produce the same deformation effect. In order to use the wrap 220 with a<br>
different model 210, the binding between the subdivision mesh 400 and the new model 220 is<br>
first established by the method described above (step 320). Prior art software does not support<br>
placing weights on a wrap 220. Instead, weights are placed directly on a model 210.<br>
[0065] The blending parameter determines to what extent a CV in a wrap 220 is<br>
influenced by its current position when the wrap 220 is subjected to a deformation. If the<br>
blending parameter value is low, the new position of the CV will be based mainly on its previous<br>
(neutral) position, with some influence from its calculated pure deformed position (e.g., via a<br>
linear interpolation between the two positions). If the blending parameter value is high , the new<br>
position of the CV will be based mainly on its calculated pure deformed position, with some<br>
influence from its previous (neutral) position.<br>
[0066] Other binding parameters may include elasticity of deformation, color, and mass<br>
or inertia (to affect the model's dynamic behavior).<br>
[0067] Once the new positions of the CVs 700 on the model 210 have been calculated<br>
360, the computer recalculates the model 210 using these new positions, as discussed above with<br>
reference to manual manipulation of CVs.<br>
[0068] A user can also request a rebinding of a model to a subdivision surface. Rebinding<br>
comprises recalculating the subdivision mesh 400 (if needed), rebinding the model 210 to the<br>
subdivision mesh 400, and storing the binding projection coord inates. A user may want to rebind<br>
a model 210 if, for example, the user has changed the value of the subdivision level parameter,<br>
edited the wrap 220 (e.g., by adding a face or removing an edge), or changed the value of a<br>
binding parameter. Alternatively, a user may want to replace the original wrap 220 or the<br>
original model 210 with a different wrap or model, respectively.<br>
[0069] The embodiments described above use one wrap 220. However, it is sometimes<br>
useful to use two wraps 220: a reference wrap to which a model 210 is bound and an editable (or<br>
"live") wrap that provides current binding site information to use when updating the CVs of a<br>
model 210. The editable wrap is identical to the reference wrap except for the locations of its<br>
coordinates. In this embodiment, two subdivision surfaces are computed. The subdivision surface<br>
computed from the reference wrap is used to compute bi nding sites 900, while the subdivision<br>
surface computed from the editable wrap is used to determine the current locations of the binding<br>
sites 900 for each CV of the model 210. The binding frames of coordinates from the latter<br>
subdivision surface and the binding projection coordinates from the former subdivision surface<br>
are used to calculate the new coordinates of the CVs of the model 210.<br>
[0070] In one embodiment, both the reference wrap and the editable wrap can be moved<br>
and edited simultaneously. Moving the reference wrap displaces the area of influence along the<br>
model 210, having binding sites 900 slide through the model 210. Moving the editable wrap<br>
introduces local deformations to the model 210.<br>
[00711 FIG. 16 illustrates a flowchart of a method for wrap deforming a model according<br>
to another embodiment of the invention. In the first step, a subdivision surface is calculated 1610<br>
from the reference wrap. Then, bindings are created 1620 from the model 210 to the subdivision<br>
surface calculated in step 1610. A second subdivision surface is then calculated 1630 from the<br>
editable wrap. This subdivision surface is then used to update 1640 binding projection<br>
coordinates. Finally, the locations of the CVs of the model 210 are calculated, and the deformed<br>
model is output 1650.<br>
