CROSS-REFERENCE<br>
This application is a Divisional application divided out of application number<br>
00009/KOLNP/2004 dated 02.01.2004.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to measuring devices for electrical installations, and in<br>
particular to measuring devices including a current/voltage detection module for<br>
analysing current and voltage to facilitate, inter alia, a residual current detection<br>
and power consumption.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A method of detecting for residual current may involve using a current<br>
transformer having primary windings through which, in the case of a single<br>
phase device, load current flows in opposite directions so that if the return<br>
current is different from the outwardly flowing current because of current<br>
leakage, an output current signal is induced in a secondary winding of the<br>
transformer. In the case of a multi-phase device, primary windings of the<br>
transformer are connected in all of the phase lines and the neutral line. In<br>
normal situations, when there is no current leakage, the net current induced in<br>
the secondary winding is zero and therefore no output is detected. These devices<br>
are subject to nuisance tripping arising from surges in the supply, switches in<br>
appliances and the like. Further problems arise because the transformer is<br>
designed to be sensitive to very small current imbalances caused by current<br>
leakage. With relatively large current leakage faults, the magnetic flux may cause<br>
the transformer core to become saturated and so fail to induce a current in the<br>
secondary winding. Alternatively, a large induced current may cause saturation<br>
of an amplifier in the electronic circuit which is used to process the induced<br>
current signal.<br><br>
Also, toroidal transformer devices may be insensitive to dc current leakage faults,<br>
such that the fault goes undetected and no trip occurs. Many electrical systems<br>
incorporate switching power supplies, for example ac to dc converters and<br>
inverters in motor speed control and start-up systems. In such systems the ac<br>
supply phases are switched electronically (for example with high voltage FETs) to<br>
provide rectified waveform signals. In such cases a current leakage fault may not<br>
induce sufficient current in the secondary winding to detect the fault. <br><br>
One method of determining power consumption is to measure the voltage<br>
across the power supply wires and the current flowing through them and then<br>
multiply the current by the voltage measurement to determine a power<br>
measurement. One approach is to use a shunt of known value connected in series<br>
with one of the wires and to measure the voltage across and current flowing through<br>
it. Power meters include a counter or clock for measuring the number of watt-<br>
hours consumed. The counter or clock is periodically read manually in order that<br>
the consumer can be billed for the quantity of electricity used.<br>
Shunt resistors could also be used to detect an imbalance in the current<br>
caused by a current leakage. However, to be useful on their own as a residual<br>
current detection safety device for tripping a circuit breaker, the shunt resistors<br>
would have to be extremely accurate. The current flowing through the shunts<br>
would need to be detected to an accuracy in the order of 1 to 10 mA in 100 A (10-5<br>
to 10"4). This means that sophisticated and complex measurement circuitry would<br>
be needed to provide the required resolution as well as precise and stable shunt<br>
resistors having linear resistance characteristics.<br>
Conventionally, residual current devices and power consumption meters are<br>
separate discrete devices. The power consumption meter is usually located at the<br>
point of entry of the electricity supply into the premises and the residual current<br>
device is located within the consumer unit or fuse box from which the circuits to the<br>
premises are distributed.<br>
It is an aim of the present invention to devise a measuring device which<br>
overcomes or at least alleviates these problems. It is a further aim of the invention<br>
to devise a measuring device which is less bulky than conventional devices and<br>
operates to an improved degree of sophistication such as to facilitate remote<br>
monitoring of the electrical installation. It is an aim of embodiments of the<br>
invention to devise a combined residual current and power measuring device which<br>
meets these aims.<br><br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a measuring device for<br>
an electrical installation having an ac supply via a neutral conductor and at least one<br>
live conductor, the device comprising a toroidal transformer detector for generating<br>
a residual current signal in response to a detected residual current in said electrical<br>
installation, a shunt resistor detector for generating respective current signals<br>
indicative of current detected in said neutral conductor and each of said at least one<br>
live conductors, a processor means for generating a trip signal indicative of the<br>
presence of a residual current fault in dependence on said residual current signal<br>
and/or said respective current signals detected.<br>
The device may further comprise a circuit breaker operative to break said ac<br>
supply in response to said trip signal.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, for each of said at least one live conductors, the<br>
device may further comprise a resistor detector means for connection between said<br>
neutral and live conductors and operative for providing a signal representative of<br>
the voltage between said neutral and live conductors by measurement of the voltage<br>
drop across said resistor detector means or a potentially divided portion thereof.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the processor means comprises a first<br>
analog to digital converter coupled to a secondary winding of said transformer for<br>
generating said residual current signal as a digital signal representative of the<br>
voltage sensed across the winding and/or the current in the winding.<br>
The processor means may further comprise a second analog to digital<br>
converter coupled to the shunt resistor detector for generating digital signals<br>
representative of the current flowing through said neutral conductor and each of<br>
said at least one live conductors.<br>
The first and/or second analog to digital converter may also be coupled to<br>
said resistor detector means for generating digital signals representative of said<br>
voltage between said neutral and live conductors.<br><br>
Alternatively, the first and/or second analog to digital converters may<br>
include a multiplexer for selectively coupling two or more of said detector means<br>
and generating corresponding digital signals representative of the voltage or current<br>
detected.<br>
Each analog to digital converter may include a delta-sigma modulator.<br>
The processor means may include a microprocessor for receiving the digital<br>
signals from the first and second analog to digital converters for determining the<br>
power consumed by the electrical installation from the digital signals. The<br>
microprocessor may be further operative for generating a. current imbalance signal<br>
indicative of the residual current during real time from the residual current signal.<br>
The microprocessor may be further operative for generating said current imbalance<br>
signal from a comparison of said current signals indicative of the current in said<br>
neutral and live conductors. The microprocessor may be further operative for<br>
generating said trip signal on the basis of a comparison of said current imbalance<br>
signal with a predetermined threshold criterion.<br>
The microprocessor may be yet further operative for analysing the residual<br>
current, current and voltage in order to detect one or more other conditions,<br>
including,, overcurrent, arc fault, standing current leakage, and "True power"<br>
measurement from the phase angle (Power = Voltage * Current * Cosine (Phi)).<br>
The power consumption, together with the other operating conditions or events may<br>
be logged for future reference. This information is useful for diagnostic purposes.<br>
A temperature sensor may be provided to allow for compensation for<br>
temperature fluctuations in the shunts. The microprocessor may be calibrated to<br>
generate current and voltage signals taking into account the temperature of the<br>
shunts relative to a reference point.<br>
The microprocessor may be arranged to adjust the threshold of the residual<br>
current necessary to generate a trip signal if it learns that the residual current is<br>
caused by a standing leakage at the installation. The residual current detector<br><br>
function will therefore continue to operate as a safety device while minimising the<br>
possibility of nuisance tripping. For example, if there were a standing leakage of<br>
10mA when the monitoring device is installed, the device would trip when the<br>
predetermined threshold is reached above the 10mA level rather than zero.<br>
A communication device may be provided for transmitting this information<br>
to a remote monitoring station.<br>
According to a related aspect which does not form part of the present<br>
invention, there is provided a measuring device for an electrical installation<br>
comprising a plurality of conductors, the device comprising toroid means for<br>
detecting a residual current and power consumption means comprising a shunt<br>
detector means for generating a current signal indicative of current detected in at<br>
least one of said conductors and a resistor detector means for generating a voltage<br>
signal indicative of voltage across at least one pair of said conductors.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the electrical installation comprises an ac supply<br>
via a neutral conductor and a live conductor, said toroid means comprising a<br>
toroidal transformer detector for generating a residual current signal in response to<br>
a detected, residual current in said electrical installation, and said resistor detector<br>
means is provided for connection between said neutral and live conductors to<br>
generate said voltage signal by measuring the voltage drop across the resistor<br>
detector means or a potentially divided portion thereof, the device further<br>
comprising a processor means for generating a trip signal indicative of the presence<br>
of a residual current fault in dependence on said residual current signal, thereby to<br>
facilitate operation of a circuit breaker to break said ac supply in response to said<br>
trip signal, and an output signal derived from said current: and voltage signals to<br>
facilitate determination of power consumption.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the ac supply may comprise a plurality of<br>
phases, each phase comprising a supply via a phase live conductor and said neutral<br>
conductor, wherein the shunt detector means comprises a respective shunt<br>
connected in series in each of said phase live conductors for providing a respective<br><br>
current signal indicative of the current flowing in the respective phase live<br>
conductor, and said resistor detector means comprises a respective resistor means<br>
connected between each of said phase live conductors and said neutral conductor,<br>
said processor being operative for generating signals representative of the voltage<br>
between each phase live conductor and said neutral conductor by measuring the<br>
voltage across each of said resistor means or potentially divided portions thereof.<br>
According to another related aspect that does not form part of the claimed<br>
invention, there is provided a combined toroid/shunt device for detecting a residual<br>
current in an electrical installation comprising a plurality of conductors, the device<br>
comprising: a toroid means for detecting an ac residual current in a first range; a<br>
plurality of resistive shunts for connection in respective ones of said plurality of<br>
conductors: and current detection means responsive to current flowing in each of<br>
said shunts for detecting a dc residual current and/or an ac residual current in a<br>
second range.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the first range of ac residual current is an ac<br>
residual current resulting from earth leakage or cross-leakage between the<br>
conductors up to a saturation level at which the toroid or electronic means<br>
associated therewith become saturated, and the second range includes ac residual<br>
currents above said saturation level.<br>
The conductors may comprise a live conductor and a neutral conductor.<br>
Alternatively the conductors may comprise a neutral conductor and a plurality of<br>
live conductors in an installation having a multi-phase supply.<br>
It is evident that, in embodiments of the invention, the device is provided<br>
with two means for detecting a residual current. The toroidal transformer facilitates<br>
detection of a current imbalance between the neutral and live conductors, indicative<br>
of a residual current, from the voltage induced in the secondary winding. The<br>
toroidal transformer can detect a residual current of a very low level (10mA or<br>
less). The shunt detector facilitates detection of a current imbalance from a<br>
comparison of the current detected in the neutral and live conductors. The shunt<br><br>
detector may thereby facilitate detection of a residual current even when the residual<br>
current arises from a dc fault, not detectable by the transformer. The shunt detector<br>
may also facilitate detection of residual current in circumstances where the magnetic<br>
flux causes the transformer to saturate.<br>
It is evident that embodiments of the invention provide for an integral or<br>
combined, power and residual current device. One advantage arising out of this is<br>
that the power meter, which is usually owned by the electricity supplier, may be<br>
owned by the user. Parameters relating to electricity usage and fault conditions are<br>
transmitted to a station monitored by the supplier for billing, diagnostic,<br>
consumption or service purposes. It is also apparent that a reduction in bulk<br>
relative to conventional power measuring and separate residual current devices is<br>
possible. This allows devices embodying the invention to be embedded in<br>
appliances to provide for trip avoidance, greater discrimination, failure indication<br>
and downstream monitoring. Sub-circuit metering may be effected particularly if<br>
the devices are networked, this enabling better discrimination and isolation of<br>
faults, 'ripping the sub-circuit first, before the main circuit trips. Further uses are<br>
envisaged' such as providing warning data prior to tripping and use in building<br>
management systems.<br>
The invention will now be further described by way of example with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a block diagram of a combined power meter and residual current<br>
device embodying the present invention applied to a single phase electricity supply;<br>
Figure 2 is a block diagram of a combined power meter and residual current<br>
device embodying the present invention applied to a three phase electricity supply;<br>
and<br>
Figure 3 is a flow chart indicating an operating sequence for residual current<br>
detection in a device embodying the present invention.<br><br>
One structural configuration of a monitoring device embodying the present<br>
invention is shown in Figures 1 and 2. Figure 1 shows a single phase device in<br>
which a toroidal transformer core 1 is coupled to live and neutral conductors 2 and<br>
3 respectively of an ac mains supply. A secondary coil 4 is wrapped around the<br>
core 1 and coupled to a first analog to digital converter 5 for generating a digital<br>
output O1 representative of the imbalance current sensed by the toroidal transformer<br>
1.<br>
A shunt detector means comprises a resistive shunt 6a provided in series<br>
with the mains neutral conductor 3. This may be of a resistive material such as<br>
manganin having a nominal resistance of 0.2mΣ to a tolerance of less than 5%.<br>
Respective ends of the shunt 6a are connected to an analog to digital converter 7<br>
which produces a digitised output 02 representative of the voltage drop across the<br>
shunt 6a. The voltage drop across shunt 6a provides a measure of the current<br>
flowing in the neutral conductor 3.<br>
A resistor detector means comprises a potential divider having resistors 8a,<br>
8b, 9 connected between the mains live and neutral conductors 2, 3 respectively.<br>
The voltage between these conductors can be determined by measuring the voltage<br>
drop across the resistor 8a by connecting respective ends of the resistor 8a to the<br>
second analog to digital converter 7. The digitised output 02 contains the<br>
information on the voltage across the resistor 8a.<br>
A power supply unit 10 is provided for drawing power from the live and<br>
neutral mains conductors 2, 3 and for supplying controlled voltages to the analog to<br>
digital converters 5, 7 via isolation barriers 11, 12 and processor 13. A multi-<br>
plexer may be provided in each converter for providing to the processor, through<br>
the respective isolation barrier, signals representing both the current in the<br>
associated shunt and the voltage at one end of it. The processor 13 uses these<br>
signals to monitor the current in each shunt as well as the imbalance current sensed<br>
by the coil 4 of the toroidal transformer 1.<br><br>
In the event of a current imbalance exceeding a predetermined threshold, the<br>
processor generates a trip signal 03 which drives a solenoid actuator 14 for<br>
breaking or tripping respective conductors 2, 3 via a circuit breaker indicated<br>
schematically by switches 15 and 16 in Figure 1.<br>
The processor 13 is also provided with a Universal Asynchronous Receiver<br>
Transmitter (UART) 25 as a means for generating and transmitting an output signal<br>
in the form serial data communications 04. The processor 13 provides output<br>
signals based on the current and voltage signals detected. This may include a power<br>
consumption signal based on power calculated from the detected current and voltage<br>
signals together with a time derived from a signal from a clock generator 26 within<br>
the processor 13.<br>
Each one of the analog to digital converters comprises an analog to digital<br>
converter in the form of a delta-sigma modulator 17 which provides a high<br>
frequency one bit digital data stream. A temperature sensor 18 is provided so that<br>
the digitised output signals 01 and 02 are modified to compensate for temperature<br>
fluctuations. The modification may be effected by means of a calibration technique<br>
involving the use of a look up table (not shown). The temperature compensation<br>
may take the form of a polynomial fitted to calibration test results, the polynomial<br>
coefficients being stored in the look-up table.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, the shunt detector means comprises a further shunt<br>
resistor 6b provided in series with the mains live conductor 2. Respective ends of<br>
the further shunt 6b are connected to analog to digital converter 5 such that digitised<br>
output 02- contains a digital signal representative of the voltage drop across the<br>
further shunt 6b. The voltage drop across further shunt 6b provides a measure of<br>
the current flowing in the live conductor 2. The processor 13 performs a<br>
comparison of the detected currents in the live and neutral conductors 2, 3 to detect<br>
a residual current. A residual current not detected by the toroidal transformer 1,<br>
for example a dc residual current or a saturating residual current, will be detected<br>
by the shunt detector, from which the processor 13 generates trip signal 03.<br><br>
The resistors 8a, 8b and 9 that comprise the resistor detector means provide<br>
an additional voltage signal by connecting respective ends of the resistor 8b to the<br>
first analog to digital converter 5, The digitised output 01 contains the information<br>
on the voitage across the resistor 8b. The resistors 8a, 8b, across which<br>
connections are made to provide the voltage signals, are precision resistors of<br>
relatively low ohmic value, while the intermediate resistor 9 has a relatively high<br>
ohmic value. The ratio of the voltages measured across precision resistors 8a 8b<br>
should remain constant. By monitoring this ratio, an independent reference is<br>
provided, so that if the ratio changes over time due to drift in the analog to digital<br>
converter 5 or its references, an adjustment can be made by software within<br>
processor 13 to correct the value of the measured voltage.<br>
Figure 2 shows a three-phase arrangement in which features similar to those<br>
of Figure! have a same reference numeral. In this case, the ac supply has two<br>
additional live conductors 21, 22 for the second and third supply phases<br>
respectively. Two additional analog to digital converters 14, 15 are provided for<br>
the additional two phases. These generate outputs representative of the sensed<br>
current and voltage for the second and third phases respectively and supply these to<br>
the processor 13 via isolation barriers 19 and 20. In the arrangement of Figure 2,<br>
the shunt detector means comprises resistive shunt 6a in the mains neutral conductor<br>
3, and resistive shunts 6b, 6c, 6d in each of the mains live conductors 2, 21, 22<br>
respectively. It is noted that the voltage sensing connections to analog to digital<br>
converters 23 and 24 are made via resistor chains connected between each phase<br>
line and the neutral in a similar manner to the resistors 8a, 8b and 9 of Figure 1.<br>
In both Figure 1 and Figure 2, the processor 13 is programmed to carry out<br>
the necessary calculations to determine the existence of an imbalance. It is also<br>
programmed to determine the current and voltage in respect of each phase to a high<br>
degree of precision for a subsequent power measurement. These measurements<br>
may be analysed in order to detect one or more other operating conditions including<br>
arc fault, standing current leakage, True power measurement. This information is<br>
useful for diagnostic purposes.<br><br>
Referring to Figure 3, the operating procedure of a monitoring device<br>
includes certain functions that are performed by hardware components and others<br>
that are performed by a software program in the processor which comprises a<br>
micro-controller unit (MCU). At step 101 the power supply is activated. Various<br>
checks are performed by the hardware to ensure that the supply is not switched on<br>
in the presence of a large residual current. A power supply unit monitor 102<br>
checks that the power supply is stable, if not the device waits until the supply is<br>
stable before proceeding to step 104 where a check is made that the clock in the<br>
MCU is stable. Once stability has been confirmed buy these checks the MCU is<br>
reset at step 107. If the checks at steps 103 and 104 do not confirm stability such<br>
that the MCU is reset within a predetermined time, then at step 105 a watchdog<br>
timeout 106 provides a signal to operate a solenoid at step 108 that isolates the<br>
power supply.<br>
Once the MCU has been reset, software in the MCU performs a calibration<br>
of the analog to digital converters at step 109. The calibration uses predetermined<br>
criteria so that the analog current and voltage signals measured are converted into<br>
digital signals representing the currents/voltages with the required precision.<br>
Operating standards to which residual current devices are required to comply<br>
are usually defined in terms of RMS current values. Therefore the processor<br>
calculates the RMS values of the voltages and currents detected. To evaluate an<br>
RMS value accurately, the calculation must be performed over a full signal cycle or<br>
an integer multiple of signal cycles. This may be done by using a known supply<br>
frequency, or by measuring the supply frequency, for example by performing a<br>
Fourier analysis on a sample of measured values. Alternatively the RMS<br>
calculation may be peformed over a specific time interval which contains an integer<br>
multiple of cycles for all rated operating frequencies. In either case, at step 110 the<br>
MCU must initialise the RMS values and timing means.<br>
A new RMS value can be calculated for each input waveform cycle or after<br>
each instantaneous measurement. The former method obtains a new RMS value<br>
every cycle and the latter after every measurement sample. The latter method is<br><br>
preferred as it gives a faster response time to any suddenly appearing residual<br>
current or overcurrent. In either case it takes at least 20ms (rated frequency =<br>
50Hz) to obtain the first RMS value. This is a significant portion of the time<br>
allowed for tripping on power up in the presence of a residual current, so it may be<br>
advantageous to have a specific routine at power up which looks at instantaneous<br>
values rather than RMS.<br>
Many mains measurement systems sample at frequencies to include the 31s'<br>
harmonic. Allowing for operation up to 60Hz and a frequency tolerance of ±5%<br>
gives a minimum sampling frequency of 3906Hz, so a sampling frequency of 4KHz<br>
is often used, and this would seem a good basis for initial design. However, to<br>
ensure an integer number of samples at both rated mains frequencies of 50Hz and<br>
60Hz a sampling frequency of 3.9Khz or 4.2KHz is preferred.<br>
The MCU, at step 111, evaluates the currents and voltages from the detected<br>
signals, at step 112 calculates the residual current I), and at step 113 calculates the<br>
RMS values.<br>
At steps 114 to 117 the MCU performs various calculations and comparisons<br>
for determining whether an unsafe condition in the form of a residual current or<br>
other predefined condition exists. In the presence of an unsafe condition a trip<br>
signal is generated so as to operate the solenoid at step 108 to isolate the supply.<br>
The calculations and comparisons performed will depend on the type of residual<br>
current device employed. For example the comparisons shown at steps 115 and 117<br>
would only be suitable for use with a residual current operated circuit-breaker<br>
having over-current protection (RCBO).<br>
