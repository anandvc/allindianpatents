Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a 2-mercapto-5-phenyl-l, 3,4-oxadiazolyl- (Z)-4-bromo-2-methoxyimino butyric acid derivative used in the preparation of cephalosporin antibiotics. The present invention also discloses the process of preparing novel thioester derivatives of the general formula (I) by reacting 4-halogeno-2~methoxyimino-3-oxo~butyric acid (II) with 5- substituted-!, 3,4-oxadiazole-2-thiol of formula (III). The invention also discloses the use of the new intermediate (1) for the preparation of cephalosporanic antibiotics (V^) in excellent yields and purity<br><br>
wherein<br>
X represents halogen (CL Br and I)<br>
R1 represents C1-C4 alkyl or phenyl<br>
Background Art<br>
Acid chlorides, anhydrides, esters, amide etc, are reported in the chemical literature for activation of carboxylic acid of formula (IV). Activation in the form of acid chloride required protection and deprotection of NH2 group.<br><br>
Activation of 2- (2-aminothiazol-4-yI)-2-methoxyiminoacetic acid (IV) by S02C12/DMF is reported in US patent 5,856, 502 and activation of SOCIz/DMF is reported in US patent 5,037, 988. These processes suffers with the limitation of poor by moderate yields along with the use of solvents like benzene and stringent conditions required for carrying out the reactions at commercial scale.<br><br>
In US patent No.4,576,749 and 4,548,748 the acid of formula (IV) have also been activated by reacting with 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT) or 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT) in the presence of dicyclohexylcarbodimide (DCC) to produce reactive ester of the acid (TV) which reacted to cephem moiety to prepare cephem antibiotics, but the processes are time consuming and with low yields, hence not suitable.<br>
US patent 4,767,852 discloses a process for production of cephems by acylating 7-ainino-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid with 2-mercaptoben2othiazolyl-(Z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-methoxyiminoacetate (MAEM). Similarly, US PatNo,5,026,843 disclosed a process for preparing ceftriaxone disodium hemiheptahydrate by acylation of 7-amino-3-[[(2,5-dihydio-6-hydroxy-2-methyl-5-oxo-l,2,4-triazin-3yl)thio]methyl]3-cephem-4-carboxyU^ acid (ACT) by using MAEM as acylating agents in good yield and quality. Thus MAEM has become the standard acylating agent for the preparation of cephalosporins having an oximino group and a 2-aminothiazolyl group in 7-position of cephem compounds. However, the synthesis of MAEM from 2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-methoxyiminoacetic acid (IV) and 2,2'-dithio-bis-benzothiazole involves use of costly condensing agent triphenylphosphine (TPP). Moreover, during condensation of MAEM with 7-amino-3-cephem-4-caiboxylic acid compound (V) , a toxic compound MBT is also produced as a byproduct, see e.g.. Chemical Abstracts, 111, 19243p (1989) which is difficult to remove completely.<br>
Thus it is evident that the procedures described in the prior art for preparation of these antibiotics are complex, involving protection, deprotection and are associated with toxic byproduct generation. Hence there is a need to develop new acylating agents which are capable of transferring the 2-aminothiazolyl moiety to cephem compounds of formula (V) in good yield but without producing this toxic byproduct. On the similar lines, a new thioester was reported by D.G.Walker, Tet. Lett. 1990, 31,6481 to acylate the cephem moiety to get cefepime sulfate but yields obtained by using this thioester wore in the range of 54-73% which cannot be considered as good yield to operate a process at commercial scale. The use of this thioester was reported in the Tet. Lett. 1990, 31, 6481 only for cefepime and not for other cephalosporins. This thioester was exploited in US patent No. 5,869,649 for making three other important cephem antibiotics.<br>
Synthesis of 4-halogeno - 2 - methoxyimino-3-oxo-butyric acid is reported in patent no. EP 0 030 294 and a large number of references are available in the patent literature disclosing the use of 4-halogeno-2-methoxyimino-3-oxo-butyric acid represented by formula (H) as the starting material. EP 0030294 and WO 00 0063214 discloses the condensation of the 4-<br><br><br><br>
Statement of Invention<br>
The present invention provides a 2-mercapto-5-phenyl-l, 3,4-oxadiazolyl- {Z)-4-bromo-2-methoxyimino butyric acid derivative used in the preparation of cephalosporin antibiotics. The present invention also discloses the process of preparing novel thioester derivatives of the general formula (I) by reacting 4-halogeno-2~methoxyiniino-3~oxo-butyric acid (II) with 5- substituted-h 3.4-oxadia7-ole-2-thiol of formula (III). The invention also discloses the use of the new intermediate (1) for the preparation of cephalosporanic antibiotics (VT) in excellent yields and purity<br><br><br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides new thioesters of 4-halogeno-2-methoxyimino-3-oxo-butyric acid of general fonnula (I). The synthesis of compound (I) is achieved by preparing activated complex of 4-halogeno-2-methoxyimino-3-oxo-butyric acid (H) with DMF-POCI3 followed by the reaction with thio-oxadiazoles of the general formula (HI) in organic solvent in presence of an organic base at the temperature between -30°C and +20°C- The reactive active ester is obtained quantitative yields (95-99%).<br><br>
product (Vn) which is formed during this reaction has also been controlled in the process.<br>
Surprisingly this side reaction has never been  mentioned in the literature.<br>
In an embodiment, in the compound of formula (I), X is chloro, bromo or iodo.<br>
In    another   embodiment   the   organic    solvent   is    selected   from   the   group<br>
comprising    dichloromethane,    tetrahydrofuran,    dioxane,    N,N-dimethylformamide,<br>
acctonitrile and mixtures thereof.<br>
In still another embodiment the organic base is selected from the group comprising<br>
triethylamine, diethylamine, tributylamine, pyridine, N-alkylanilines, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The compound (I) so obtained is reacted with 7-amino cephem carboxylic acid of general<br>
foramla (V) in two different methods and both the methods lead to same product with<br>
comparable yields and purity.<br>
Using above mentioned thioester the cephalosporin antibiotics obtained are of high purity<br><br>
(90-99%), The method gives an excellent yield (70-95%) of cephalosporin without<br>
necessitating the protection of the amino group of the acylating agents, and the toxic<br>
byproduct 2-mercaptoben20thiazole is not produced.<br>
The cephalosporin antibiotic were synthesized by following two methods:<br>
Method-I The reactive thioester (I) was reacted with 7-aminocephem compound (V)<br><br>
in organic solvent in the presence of base to obtained condensed product, which was not<br>
isolated and is directly cyclised with thiourea in mixture of water and a polar organic<br>
solvent like tetrahydrofuran, dimethylfonnamide, dioxane, alcohol to obtain desired<br>
cephalosporanic antibiotics of very good purity and excellent yields.<br>
Method -II<br>
In this approach, starting from active ester of formula (I) final product was prepared in one<br><br>
pot reaction. The process comprises cyclization of active ester in the first step and in same<br>
reactor addition of amino cephem compound in mixture of water and a polar organic<br>
solvent like tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide, dioxane, alcohols to obtain desired<br>
cephalosporanic antibiotics of equally good purity and yields as compared to first<br>
approach. This approach provides a simple , cheap and commercially viable method<br>
without the necessity of isolating thioester and without producing any toxic byproduct<br>
namely 2-mercaptobenzothiazole.<br>
The substituent R2 in cephem compound (V) and (VI) represents hydrogen, methyl,<br>
acetyloxymethyl, methoxymethyl, 2,5-dihydro-6-hydroxy-2-methyl-5-oxo-l,2,4-triazine-3-<br>
thiol, furanyl-2-carbonyl thiol or a standard cephalosporin substituents.<br>
R3 in cephem compound (V) and (VI) represents hydrogen , salt or a ester group which can<br>
be easily removed e.g. p-methoxybenzyl , p-nitrobenzyl , diphenylmethyl   , phenacyl ,<br>
trimethylsilyl etc.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the organic base may be selected from the<br>
group consisting of triethylamine, N-methylmorpholine, pyridine, N-methylanilines, 1,5-<br>
diazabicyclo[4.3.0] non-5-ene, l,4-diazabicyclo[2*2.2]octane, 4-dimethylaminopyridine,<br>
and mixtures thereof.<br>
Many other beneficial results can be obtained by applying disclosed invention in a<br>
different manner or by modifying the invention with the scope of disclosure. However,<br>
V<br>
since the major characteristic feature of the present invention resides in the use of novel reactive thioester derivatives of 4-bromo-2-methoxyimino-3-oxo-butyric acid of the general formula (I) in preparing the cephalosporin antibiotics, the technical scope of the present invention should not be limited to the following examples.
