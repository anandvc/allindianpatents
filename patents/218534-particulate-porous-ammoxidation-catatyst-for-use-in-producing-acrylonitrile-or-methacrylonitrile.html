				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a particulate po-<br>
rous ammoxidation catalyst which can be advantageously<br>
used in producing acrylonitrile or methacrylonitrile by<br>
reacting propylene, isobutene or tert-butyl alcohol<br>
with molecular oxygen and ammonia in a fluidized-bed<br>
reactor. More particularly, the present invention is<br>
concerned with a particulate porous ammoxidation cata-<br>
lyst which comprises a metal oxide and a silica carrier<br>
having supported thereon the metal oxide, wherein the<br>
metal oxide contains at least two elements selected<br>
from the group consisting of molybdenum, bismuth, iron,<br>
vanadium, antimony, tellurium and niobium, the catalyst<br>
having a particle diameter distribution wherein the<br>
amount of catalyst particles having a particle diameter<br>
of from 5 to 200 Âµm is from 90 to 100 % by weight,<br>
based on the weight of the catalyst, and having a pore<br>
distribution wherein the cumulative pore volume of<br>
pores having a pore diameter of 80 A or less is not<br>
more than 20 %, based on the total pore volume of the<br>
catalyst, and the cumulative pore volume of pores hav-<br>
ing a pore diameter of 1,000 A or more is not more than<br>
20 %, based on the total pore volume of the catalyst.<br>
The present invention is also concerned with a method<br>
for efficiently producing this catalyst. The ammoxida-<br>
tion catalyst of the present invention exhibits not<br>
only high activity in producing the desired product but<br>
also high attrition resistance when used on a commer-<br>
cial scale. Therefore, the catalyst of the present in-<br>
vention is advantageous in that, when the catalyst of<br>
the present invention is used for performing a cata-<br>
lytic ammoxidation of propylene, isobutene or tert-<br>
butyl alcohol in a fluidized-bed reactor, acrylonitrile<br>
or methacrylonitrile can be produced stably in high<br>
yield.<br>
Prior Art<br>
It has been well known to produce acrylonitrile or<br>
methacrylonitrile by ammoxidation of propylene, isobu-<br>
tene or tert-butyl alcohol, namely, a reaction of pro-<br>
pylene, isobutene or tert-butyl alcohol with molecular<br>
oxygen and ammonia. A number of proposals have been<br>
made with respect to catalysts for use in the ammoxida-<br>
tion of propylene, isobutene or tert-butyl alcohol.<br>
For example. Examined Japanese Patent Application Pub-<br>
lication No. Sho 38-17967 proposes an oxide catalyst<br>
containing molybdenum, bismuth and iron, and Examined<br>
Japanese Patent Application Publication No. Sho 38-<br>
19111 proposes an oxide catalyst containing antimony<br>
and iron. Further, various improvements have been pro-<br>
posed with respect to these ammoxidation catalysts.<br>
A number of proposals have been made to improve an<br>
ammoxidation catalyst by changing the composition<br>
thereof, and such proposals have contributed to the im-<br>
provement of the catalyst performance. However, there<br>
have not been made many proposals to improve an ammoxi-<br>
dation catalyst by changing the physical structure of<br>
the catalyst. As examples of prior art documents dis-<br>
closing such proposals, there can be mentioned Examined<br>
Japanese Patent Application Publication No. Sho 57-<br>
56373 (corresponding to U.S. Patent No. 4,264,476)<br>
which discloses a catalyst for ammoxidation of propyl-<br>
ene, containing molybdenum, bismuth, iron, cobalt and<br>
zirconium as essential components, and Unexamined Japa-<br>
nese Patent Application Laid-Open Specification No. Sho<br>
57-75147 which discloses a catalyst for ammoxidation of<br>
propylene, containing molybdenum, bismuth and antimony<br>
as essential components, wherein, in each of these<br>
catalysts, the amount of Silica carrier, average pore<br>
diameter, total pore volume and specific surface area<br>
are, respectively, in specific ranges.<br>
Each of the above-mentioned two patent documents<br>
(in which it is attempted to improve the catalyst per-<br>
formance by changing the physical structure of the<br>
catalyst) discloses a catalyst (having a specific<br>
physical structure) for use in producing acrylonitrile<br>
in a fluidized-bed reactor. However, there are no dis-<br>
closures about the pore distributions of the catalysts<br>
in these two patent documents.<br>
On the other hand, proposals paying attention to<br>
the pore distribution of an oxide catalyst, have been<br>
made in the following patent documents. Unexamined<br>
Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Specification No.<br>
Sho 57-119837 discloses a catalyst for use in the oxi-<br>
dation of an olefin in a fixed-bed reactor, wherein the<br>
catalyst has an average pore radius of 2,000 A or<br>
more. Unexamined Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open<br>
Specification No. Sho 58-113141 (corresponding to GB<br>
2030885A) discloses a process for producing methac-<br>
rolein.  Claim 3 of this patent document describes that<br>
the cumulative surface area of pores having a diameter<br>
smaller than 100 A is not more than 3 %, based on the<br>
surface area of the catalyst.  International patent ap-<br>
plication publication No. WO(33/539244 discloses a metal<br>
oxide catalyst for use in the commercial production of<br>
acrolein or acrylic acid by oxidation of propylene.<br>
wherein the physical structure (including the pore dis-<br>
tribution) of the catalyst is specified in detail.<br>
However, none of these oxide catalysts can be used<br>
in a fluidized-bed reactor. Specifically, in the<br>
above-mentioned Unexamined Japanese Patent Application<br>
Laid-Open Specification No. Sho 57-119837, claim 1 de-<br>
scribes that the catalyst is for use in a fixed-bed re-<br>
actor. Further, the catalyst of this patent document<br>
has an average pore radius as large, as 2,000 A or more<br>
and, hence, it is presumed that the catalyst exhibits<br>
poor mechanical strength. Also, the catalyst of this<br>
patent document is an extrusion-molded product (e.g., a<br>
cylinder-shaped article having a diameter of 4 mm and a<br>
length of from 4 to 8 mm in the working examples) and,<br>
hence, it is presumed that the catalyst exhibits poor<br>
fluidity. Therefore, it is apparent that the catalyst<br>
disclosed in this patent document cannot be used in a<br>
fluidized-bed reactor.  The above-mentioned Unexamined<br>
Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Specification No.<br>
Sho 58-113141 discloses a process for producing methac-<br>
rolein, wherein the mode of reaction is not specified.<br>
However, in the working examples of this patent docu-<br>
ment, there is a description that the catalyst is ob-<br>
tained as a pellet having a diameter of 4.8 mm and,<br>
hence, it is apparent that the catalyst proposed in<br>
this patent document exhibits poor fluidity and is for<br>
use in a fixed-bed reactor. Therefore, this catalyst<br>
cannot be used in a fluidized-bed reactor. In the<br>
above-mentioned international patent application publi-<br>
cation No. WO03/039744, the mode of reaction is not<br>
specified; however, the catalyst proposed in this pat-<br>
ent document has a pore distribution wherein the cumu-<br>
lative pore volume of pores having a pore diameter of<br>
from 0.1 to 1 Âµm is as large as not less than 20 %,<br>
based on the total pore volume of the catalyst. That<br>
is, the ratio of pores having a large diameter is great<br>
in the pore distribution of this catalyst and, hence,<br>
it is presumed that this catalyst exhibits poor me-<br>
chanical strength. Further, in the working examples of<br>
this patent document, there is a description that a<br>
particulate catalyst precursor is pelletized in the<br>
form of a tablet having a diameter of 5 mm and a height<br>
of 4 mm. Therefore, it is presumed that the catalyst<br>
exhibits poor fluidity and, hence, it is apparent that<br>
the catalyst proposed in this patent document is for<br>
use in a fixed-bed reactor and cannot be used in a flu-<br>
idized-bed reactor.<br>
Further, each of U.S. Patent No. 3,397,153 and Ex-<br>
amined Japanese Patent Application Publication No. Hei<br>
2-47264 (corresponding to U.S. Patent No. 4,590,173 and<br>
EP 0153077B) discloses a process for producing a sin-<br>
tered catalyst having a low density, which is prepared<br>
using a silica raw material which is a mixture of two<br>
silica sols of different average silica particle diame-<br>
ters.  In any of these two patent documents, there is<br>
no disclosure about the data of the pore distribution<br>
of the catalyst.  In the former of the two patent docu-<br>
ments, it is intended to improve the economy of the<br>
catalyst by imparting a low density to the catalyst.<br>
In the latter of the two patent documents, it is in-<br>
tended to improve the mechanical strength of an oxide<br>
catalyst containing antimony, by imparting a low den-<br>
sity to the catalyst.  In these two patent documents,<br>
there are no descriptions suggesting that there is any<br>
relationship between the pore distribution of a cata-<br>
lyst and the yield of the desired product obtained us-<br>
ing the catalyst, and there are no suggestions about an<br>
oxide catalyst exhibiting an improved yield of the de-<br>
sired product.<br>
Any of the conventional catalysts described here-<br>
inabove is still unsatisfactory in respect of the yield<br>
of the desired product. Therefore, it has been desired<br>
to develop a catalyst which can be advantageously used<br>
in the ammoxidation of propylene, isobutene or tert-<br>
butyl alcohol in a fluidized-bed reactor, so that acry-<br>
lonitrile or methacrylonitrile can be stably produced<br>
in high yield.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
In this situation, the present inventors have made<br>
extensive and intensive studies with a view toward<br>
solving the above-mentioned problems of the prior art,<br>
specifically toward developing an excellent catalyst<br>
for use in the commercial production of acrylonitrile<br>
or methacrylonitrile by reacting propylene, isobutene<br>
or tert-butyl alcohol with molecular oxygen and ammonia<br>
in a fluidized-bed reactor, wherein the catalyst can<br>
produce acrylonitrile or methacrylonitrile stably in<br>
high yield. As a result, it has unexpectedly been<br>
found that, in a particulate catalyst for use in the<br>
fluidized-bed ammoxidation of propylene, isobutene or<br>
tert-butyl alcohol, when the cumulative pore volume of<br>
small-diameter pores having a pore diameter of 80 A or<br>
less does not exceed a specific range, the catalyst ex-<br>
hibits a high yield of the desired product, and when<br>
the cumulative pore volume of large-diameter pores hav-<br>
ing a pore diameter of 1,000 A or more does not exceed<br>
a specific range, the catalyst particles exhibit a high<br>
attrition resistance.  Further, based on these findings,<br>
the present inventors have also found that, when the<br>
pore distribution of a catalyst is controlled so as to<br>
satisfy specific requirements, the catalyst exhibits<br>
not only a highly improved yield of the desired product,<br>
but also a high attrition resistance which renders the<br>
catalyst suitable for commercial use as a fluidized-bed<br>
catalyst. Based on these findings, the present inven-<br>
tion has been completed.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present inven-<br>
tion to provide a particulate porous ammoxidation cata-<br>
lyst for use in the production of acrylonitrile or<br>
methacrylonitrile by performing ammoxidation of propyl-<br>
ene, isobutene or tert-butyl alcohol in a fluidized-bed<br>
reactor, wherein the catalyst exhibits not only high<br>
activity in producing the desired product, but also<br>
high attrition resistance when used on a commercial<br>
scale, so that acrylonitrile or methacrylonitrile can<br>
be obtained stably in high yield.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to<br>
provide a method for producing the above-mentioned<br>
catalyst.<br>
It is still another object of the present inven-<br>
tion to provide a method for producing acrylonitrile or<br>
methacrylonitrile by using the above-mentioned catalyst.<br>

based on the total pore volume of the catalyst, and the<br>
cumulative pore volume of pores having a pore diameter<br>

The catalyst of the present invention has a parti-<br>
cle diameter distribution wherein the amount of cata-<br>
lyst particles having a particle diameter of from 5 to<br>
200 Âµm is from 90 to 100 % by weight, based on the<br>
weight of the catalyst. When the amount of catalyst<br>
particles having a particle diameter of from 5 to 200<br>
Âµm is less than 90 % by weight, based on the weight of<br>
the catalyst, there is a problem in that the amount of<br>
small-diameter catalyst particles having a particle di-<br>
ameter of less than 5 Âµm and the amount of large-<br>
diameter catalyst particles having a particle diameter<br>
of larger than 200 Âµm become too large, rendering poor<br>
the fluidity of the catalyst and hence leading to poor<br>
results of the reaction.<br>
With respect to the pore distribution of the cata-<br>
lyst of the present invention, the catalyst has a pore<br>
distribution wherein the cumulative pore volume of<br>
pores having a pore diameter of 80 A or less is not<br>
more than 20 %, based on the total pore volume of the<br>
catalyst, and the cumulative pore volume of pores hav-<br>
ing a pore diameter of 1,000 A or more is not more than<br>
20 %, based on the total pore volume of the catalyst.<br>
It is more preferred that the catalyst has a pore<br>
distribution wherein the cumulative pore volume of<br>
pores having a pore diameter of 80 A or less is not<br>
more than 15 %, more advantageously not more than 10 %,<br>
based on the total pore volume of the catalyst. Also,<br>
it is more preferred that the cumulative pore volume of<br>
pores having a pore diameter of 1,000 A or more is not<br>
more than 15 %, more advantageously not more than 10 %,<br>
based on the total pore volume of the catalyst.<br>
When the cumulative pore volume of pores having a<br>
pore diameter of 80 A or less is more than 20 %, based<br>
on the total pore volume of the catalyst, the catalyst<br>
poses a problem in that the yield of the desired prod-<br>
uct (i.e., acrylonitrile or methacrylonitrile) becomes<br>
low. On the other hand, when the cumulative pore vol-<br>
ume of pores having a pore diameter of 1,000 A or more<br>
is more than 20 %, based on the total pore volume of<br>
the catalyst, a problem arises in that the attrition<br>
resistance of the catalyst becomes poor and, hence, the<br>
catalyst cannot exhibit a satisfactorily high attrition<br>
resistance which renders the catalyst suitable for com-<br>
mercial use, so that it becomes impossible to stably<br>
produce the desired product. The reason why the yield<br>
of the desired product becomes low when the cumulative<br>
pore volume of pores having a pore diameter of 80 A or<br>
less is more than 20 %, based on the total pore volume<br>
of the catalyst, has not yet been elucidated.  However,<br>
it is presumed that, in the small-diameter pores having<br>
a pore diameter of 80 A or less, the residence time of<br>
the reaction product in the pores of the catalyst be-<br>
comes too long, thus accelerating decomposition of the<br>
reaction product, leading to a lowering of the yield of<br>
the desired product.<br>
With respect to the method for measuring the pore<br>
distribution of a catalyst, there are known conven-<br>
tional methods, such as the gas adsorption method and<br>
the mercury porosimetry; however, the results of meas-<br>
uring are different from method to method.  In the pre-<br>
sent invention, the measurement of the pore distribu-<br>
tion of the catalyst is performed by the mercury po-<br>
rosimetry using "Auto Pore-9200" (trade name; manufac-<br>
tured and sold by Shimadzu Corporation, Japan).  The<br>
mercury porosimetry means a method in which an external<br>
pressure is applied to force mercury into the pores in<br>
the catalyst, the amount of mercury forced into the<br>
pores is recorded in terms of a function of the pres-<br>
sure applied, and, based on this record, the pore dis-<br>
tribution of the catalyst is obtained.  In the calcula-<br>
tion for obtaining the pore distribution of the cata-<br>
lyst, it is assumed that pores have a cylindrical shape.<br>
A cumulative pore volume with respect to the pore di-<br>
ameters measured is obtained by the mercury porosimetry<br>
and plotted to obtain a cumulative pore distribution<br>
curve which is used as primary data. The cumulative<br>
pore distribution curve relative to the pore diameters<br>
measured is differentiated with the pore diameter to<br>
obtain a differential pore distribution.  The differen-<br>
tial pore distribution is plotted against the pore di-<br>
ameter, to thereby obtain a differential pore distribu-<br>
tion curve, which is the so-called pore distribution.<br>
Specifically, the measurement of the pore distribution<br>
is performed as follows.  0.3 to 0.4 g of a specimen<br>
(of the catalyst) is charged into a dilatometer, and<br>
the dilatometer is degassed using a vacuum pump so that<br>
the internal pressure of the dilatometer becomes 6.67<br>
Pa or less. Subsequently, mercury is charged into the<br>
dilatometer. Then, the dilatometer containing the<br>
specimen and mercury is placed in an autoclave. In the<br>
autoclave, the external pressure of the dilatometer is<br>
gradually increased from atmospheric pressure to 413<br>
MPa. The level of the mercury in the dilatometer is<br>
tracked and recorded as it becomes lowered under pres-<br>
sure. The pore distribution is measured from the<br>
changes in the level of mercury (namely, from the<br>
changes in amount of mercury forced into the pores of<br>
the catalyst) in terms of a function of the pressure<br>
applied.<br>
In the present invention, when performing the<br>
measurement of the pore distribution of the catalyst by<br>
the mercury porosimetry method, the. interstices between<br>
the catalyst particles are measured as pores having a<br>
pore diameter in the range of from tens of thousands to<br>
hundreds of thousands A. Therefore, in the present in-<br>
vention, the term "total pore volume" means the cumula-<br>
tive pore volume of pores having a pore diameter of<br>
5,000 A or less.<br>
In the cumulative pore distribution curve relative<br>
to the pore diameters measured, as obtained by the<br>
above-mentioned mercury porosimetry, the cumulative<br>
pore volume of pores having a pore diameter of 80 A or<br>
less is calculated as the cumulative pore volume of<br>
pores having a pore diameter in the range of from the<br>
lower limit of measurement (about 30 A) to 80 A, and<br>
the cumulative pore volume of pores having a pore di-<br>
ameter of 1,000 A or more is calculated as the cumula-<br>
tive pore volume of pores having a pore diameter in the<br>
range of from 1,000 to 5,000 A. Therefore, the total<br>
pore volume is calculated as the cumulative pore volume<br>
of pores having a pore diameter in the range of from<br>
the lower limit of measurement to 5,000 A.<br>
With respect to the measures for controlling the<br>
pore distribution of the catalyst of the present inven-<br>
tion, the pore distribution can be controlled by, for<br>
example, any of the following methods: a method in<br>
which there is changed the particle diameter of a sil-<br>
ica sol as a silica raw material (i.e., the average<br>
primary silica particle diameter); a method in which<br>
the ratios of the silica carrier and metal oxide pre-<br>
sent in the catalyst are changed; a method in which the<br>
calcination temperature is changed; a method in which a<br>
fumed silica is used as a part of the silica raw mate-<br>
rial; and a method in which the below-mentioned aqueous<br>
slurry of raw materials of the catalyst (i.e., aqueous<br>
raw material mixture) is provided so as to contain a<br>
fine particulate substance which is decomposable when<br>
burnt in air at a temperature which is equal to or<br>
lower than the calcination temperature, and the slurry<br>
is subjected to a spray drying and a calcination.  In<br>
the case of the method in which the pore distribution<br>
of the catalyst is controlled by changing the ratios of<br>
the silica carrier and metal oxide present in the cata-<br>
lyst, when the ratio of the metal oxide is increased,<br>
the pore distribution of the catalyst is shifted so<br>
that the ratio of large-diameter pores is increased.<br>
In the case of the method in which the pore distribu-<br>
tion of the catalyst is controlled by changing the cal-<br>
cination temperature, when the calcination temperature<br>
is increased, the pore distribution of the catalyst is<br>
shifted so that the ratio of large-diameter pores is<br>
increased. Further, in the case of the method in which<br>
the pore distribution of the catalyst is controlled by<br>
using an aqueous slurry of raw materials of the cata-<br>
lyst (i.e., aqueous raw material mixture) containing a<br>
fine particulate substance which is decomposable when<br>
burnt in air at a temperature which is equal to or<br>
lower than the calcination temperature, the fine par-<br>
ticulate substance forms voids when being burnt and de-<br>
composed, and the voids are left as pores of the cata-<br>
lyst. Therefore, it is preferred that the fine par-<br>
ticulate substance contained in the aqueous raw mate-<br>
rial mixture has a size in the range of from 100 to<br>
1,000 A, more advantageously 200 to 500 A, and that the<br>
fine particulate substance is made of an organic mate-<br>
rial which does not leave a residue after being burnt.<br>
(As examples of such fine particulate substances, there<br>
can be mentioned a sol of a crystalline cellulose hav-<br>
ing excellent dispersibility in water and a microemul-<br>
sion of polystyrene) . With respect to each of the<br>
method for controlling the pore distribution by chang-<br>
ing the particle diameter of the silica sol as a silica<br>
raw material (i.e., the average primary silica particle<br>
diameter) and the method for controlling the pore dis-<br>
tribution by employing a fumed silica as a part of the<br>
silica raw material, explanations are made below in<br>
connection with the method for producing the catalyst<br>
of the present invention. It should be noted that the<br>
measures for satisfying the requirements concerning the<br>
physical structure (i.e., the pore distribution) of the<br>
catalyst of the present invention are not limited to<br>
the aforementioned examples of methods, but any meas-<br>
ures can be employed as long as the requirements con-<br>
cerning the physical structure (i.e., the pore distri-<br>
bution) of the catalyst of the present invention are<br>
satisfied.<br>
Generally, it is important that a catalyst exhibit<br>
satisfactorily high attrition resistance which renders<br>
the catalyst suitable for commercial use. In the pre-<br>
sent invention, the measurement of the attrition resis-<br>
tance of the catalyst is performed in accordance with<br>
the method described in "Test Method for Synthetic<br>
Fluid Cracking Catalyst" (American Cyanamid Co., Ltd.<br>
6/31-4m-l/57) (hereinafter referred simply as "ACC<br>
method"), which is generally known as a method for de-<br>
termining the attrition resistance of a fluidized-bed<br>
catalyst for use in the catalytic cracking. The attri-<br>
tion resistance of the catalyst of the present inven-<br>
tion is measured in terms of the attrition loss which<br>
is defined by the following formula:<br>
attrition loss (%) = B / (C-A) x 100<br>
wherein:<br>
A is the weight (g) of the catalyst which is lost<br>
by attrition in the period of from 0 hour point to<br>
5 hour point after the start of the attrition re-<br>
sistance test;<br>
B is, according to the ordinary ACC method, the<br>
weight (g) of the catalyst which is lost by attri-<br>
tion in the period of from 5 hour point to 20 hour<br>
point after the start of the attrition resistance<br>
test; however, in the present invention, this B is<br>
defined as the weight (g) of the catalyst which is<br>
lost by attrition in the period of from 5 hour<br>
point to 120 hour point after the start of the at-<br>
trition resistance test; and<br>
C is the weight (g) of the catalyst used in the<br>
attrition resistance test.<br>
When the catalyst exhibits an attrition loss of<br>
7 % or less, it is judged that the catalyst has a sat-<br>
isfactorily high attrition resistance which renders the<br>
catalyst suitable for commercial use.<br>
In the catalyst of the present invention, silica<br>
is used as the carrier having supported thereon the<br>
metal oxide. Silica is inherently inert, differing<br>
from other carrier materials, and can serve as an ex-<br>
cellent binder for the ingredients of the metal oxide<br>
without impairing the selectivity of the catalyst for<br>
the desired product and serve to impart a high attri-<br>
tion resistance to the catalyst. Thus, silica is suit-<br>
able for use as the carrier in the catalyst of the pre-<br>
sent invention. The amount of silica carrier is in the<br>
range of from 20 to 80 % by weight, preferably from 30<br>
to 70 % by weight, more preferably from 40 to 60 % by<br>
weight, based on the total weight of the metal oxide<br>
and the silica carrier.<br>
With respect to the raw material for producing the<br>
carrier to support thereon the metal oxide in the cata-<br>
lyst of the present invention, oxide sols, such as a<br>
titania sol, a zirconia sol and a tin oxide sol, may be<br>
used in combination with a silica sol. When such oxide<br>
sol(s) other than a silica sol is used in combination<br>
with a silica sol, the amount of oxide sol(s) other<br>
than a silica sol in terms of the oxide is preferably<br>
10 % by weight or less, more preferably 5 % by weight<br>
or less, based on the weight of the carrier in the<br>
catalyst.<br>
As an impurity in the silica sol used as the sil-<br>
ica raw material for producing the catalyst of the pre-<br>
sent invention, there can be mentioned aluminum. The<br>
atomic ratio of aluminum present as an impurity in the<br>
silica sol is preferably 0.04 or less, more preferably<br>
0.02 or less, relative to 100 atoms of silicon present<br>
in the silica sol. The aluminum content of the silica<br>
sol may be zero; however, even when the atomic ratio of<br>
aluminum present in the silica sol is much less than<br>
0.02, relative to 100 atoms of silicon present in the<br>
silica sol, no further improvement can be achieved in<br>
the performance of the catalyst, as compared to the<br>
case where the atomic ratio of aluminum present as an<br>
impurity in the silica sol is 0.02, relative to 100 at-<br>
oms of silicon present in the silica sol. Various<br>
methods are known for producing a silica sol of very<br>
high purity, which is for use in various application<br>
fields, such as the fields of an abrasive for polishing<br>
the surface of a semiconductor, a raw material for a<br>
quartz fiber, and a carrier for a catalyst. For exam-<br>
ple, methods for producing a high purity silica sol<br>
containing only an extremely small amount of aluminum<br>
as an impurity are disclosed in Unexamined Japanese<br>
Patent Application Laid-Open Specification Nos. Sho 60-<br>
127216, Sho 61-158810, Sho 63-285112, Hei 4-231319 and<br>
Hei 5-85718, and Examined Japanese Patent Application<br>
Publication No. Sho 55-10534.  The amount of aluminum<br>
present as an impurity in a silica sol can be measured<br>
by the ICP (inductively coupled plasma) emission spec-<br>
troscopy.<br>
When it is intended to satisfy the physical struc-<br>
ture requirements (pore distribution) of the catalyst<br>
of the present invention by changing the particle di-<br>
ameter of the silica sol as the silica raw material<br>
(i.e., the average primary silica particle diameter),<br>
it is especially effective to produce the silica car-<br>
rier from a silica raw material comprising 40 to 100 %<br>
by weight of (i) at least one silica sol having an av-<br>
erage primary silica particle diameter of from 20 to<br>
100 nm and 60 to 0 % by weight of (ii) at least one<br>
silica sol having an average primary silica particle<br>
diameter of from 5 nm to less than 20 nm, wherein the<br>
total weight of the at least one silica sol (i) and the<br>
at least one silica sol (ii) is 100 % by weight, each %<br>
by weight of a silica sol being expressed in terms of<br>
the weight of silica contained in the silica sol. When<br>
the at least one silica sol (i) has an average primary<br>
silica particle diameter of from 20 nm to less than 40<br>
nm, the amount of at least one silica sol (i) is pref-<br>
erably in the range of from 80 to 100 % by weight,<br>
based on the total weight of the at least one silica<br>
sol (i) and the at least one silica sol (ii), each % by<br>
weight of a silica sol being expressed in terms of the<br>
weight of silica contained in the silica sol. When the<br>
at least one silica sol (i) has an average primary sil-<br>
ica particle diameter of from 40 nm to less than 60 nm,<br>
the amount of at least one silica sol (i) is preferably<br>
in the range of from 60 % by weight to less than 80 %<br>
by weight, based on the total weight of the at least<br>
one silica sol (i) and the at least one silica sol (ii),<br>
each % by weight of a silica sol being expressed in<br>
terms of the weight of silica contained in the silica<br>
sol. When the at least one silica sol (i) has an aver-<br>
age primary silica particle diameter of from 60 to 100<br>
nm, the amount of at least one silica sol (i) is pref-<br>
erably in the range of from 40 % by weight to less than<br>
60 % by weight, based on the total weight of the at<br>
least one silica sol (i) and the at least one silica<br>
sol (ii), each % by weight of a silica sol being ex-<br>
pressed in terms of the weight of silica contained in<br>
the silica sol. With respect to the at least one sil-<br>
ica sol (ii) (having an average primary silica particle<br>
diameter of from 5 nm to less than 20 nm), the average<br>
primary silica particle diameter is preferably in the<br>
range of from 7 to 15 nm.<br>
On the other hand, when it is intended to satisfy<br>
the physical structure requirements (pore distribution)<br>
of the catalyst of the present invention by employing a<br>
fumed silica as a part of the silica raw material, it<br>
is preferred that a fumed silica having an average pri-<br>
mary silica particle diameter of from 5 to 30 nm is<br>
used in an amount of from 10 to 50 % by weight, based<br>
on the weight of the silica carrier present in the<br>
catalyst of the present invention. The average primary<br>
silica particle diameter of the fumed silica is more<br>
preferably in the range of from 10 to 20 nm.  The<br>
amount of fumed silica is more preferably in the range<br>
of from 20 to 40 % by weight, based on the weight of<br>
the silica carrier present in the catalyst of the pre-<br>
sent invention.<br>
The average primary silica particle diameter of<br>
the silica sol or fumed silica can be measured by a<br>
conventional method, such as the BET method or the<br>
electron microscopy.  In the present invention, the av-<br>
erage primary silica particle diameter of the silica<br>
sol or fumed silica is measured by the BET method,<br>
namely the method based on the BET adsorption isotherm<br>
(i.e., the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller adsorption isotherm).<br>
Specifically, in the measurement of the average primary<br>
silica particle diameter of a silica sol, the silica<br>
sol is heated at a temperature in the range of from 100<br>
to 200 Â°C so as to evaporate the water as the disper-<br>
sion medium of the silica sol, to thereby obtain silica<br>
particles.  The obtained silica particles are caused to<br>
adsorb nitrogen gas to saturation at the temperature of<br>
a liquid nitrogen, and then the temperature of the re-<br>
sultant nitrogen gas-adsorbed silica particles is ele-<br>
vated to room temperature, to thereby cause desorption<br>
of nitrogen gas from the silica particles. The amount<br>
of desorbed nitrogen gas is measured. From the meas-<br>
ured amount of desorbed nitrogen gas, the specific sur-<br>
face area (S) (m2/g) of the particles is calculated.<br>
For calculation of the average primary silica particle<br>
diameter, it is assumed that all primary silica parti-<br>
cles are spherical and have the same diameter (D) (nm)<br>
and that the specific gravity (p) of the silica parti-<br>
cles (i.e., amorphous silica) present in the silica sol<br>
is 2.2.  The silica particle diameter (D) (nm) can be<br>
calculated by the below-mentioned formulae (wherein n<br>
represents the number of primary silica particles per g<br>
of primary silica particles):<br>
p = 4/3 x n x (D x 10-7/2)3 x n,<br>
S = 4 x p x (Dx 10-9/2)2 x n,<br>
and therefore,<br>
D = 6,000 x p/S.<br>
A most effective measure for controlling the pore<br>
distribution of a catalyst to satisfy the physical<br>
structure requirements of the catalyst of the present<br>
invention, is a method in which there is changed the<br>
particle diameter of the silica sol as a silica raw ma-<br>
terial (i.e., the average primary silica particle di-<br>
ameter) . Generally, when the diameter of the silica<br>
particles of a silica sol used for producing a catalyst<br>
is increased, the strength of the catalyst tends to be<br>
lowered. However, it is desired that a commercial<br>
catalyst for use in a fluidized-bed reactor exhibits<br>
high strength. Therefore, conventionally, there has<br>
been generally used, as a silica raw material, a silica<br>
sol having an average primary silica particle diameter<br>
of 10-odd nm. When such silica sol is used as a silica<br>
raw material for producing a silica carrier, a problem<br>
arises in that the cumulative pore volume of pores hav-<br>
ing a pore diameter of 80 A or less becomes more than<br>
20 %, based on the total pore volume of the resultant<br>
catalyst and, hence, the catalyst does not satisfy the<br>
physical structure requirements of the catalyst of the<br>
present invention. On the other hand, when only one<br>
silica sol is used as a silica raw material for produc-<br>
ing a silica carrier, a problem arises in that, in a<br>
case where the average primary silica particle diameter<br>
is relatively small, the cumulative pore volume of<br>
pores having a pore diameter of 80 A or less is likely<br>
to be more than 20 %, based on the total pore volume of<br>
the resultant catalyst.  In addition, when only one<br>
silica sol is used as a silica raw material for produc-<br>
ing a silica carrier, another problem arises in that,<br>
in a case where the average primary silica particle di-<br>
ameter is relatively large, the cumulative pore volume<br>
of pores having a pore diameter of 1,000 A or more is<br>
likely to be more than 20 %, based on the total pore<br>
volume of the resultant catalyst. That is, the physi-<br>
cal structure requirements of the catalyst of the pre-<br>
sent invention cannot be easily satisfied in the ab-<br>
sence of the knowledge of the present invention.<br>
Therefore, by using the methods disclosed in the prior<br>
art documents, it is substantially impossible to obtain<br>
a catalyst which satisfies the physical structure re-<br>
quirements of the catalyst of the present invention.<br>
Hereinbelow, explanations are made in detail on<br>
the method for producing the catalyst of the present<br>
invention.<br>
The catalyst of the present invention can be effi-<br>
ciently produced by, for example, a method for produc-<br>
ing the catalyst of the present invention, which com-<br>
prises :<br>
providing an aqueous raw material mixture contain-<br>
ing compounds of at least two elements selected from<br>
the group consisting of molybdenum, bismuth, iron, va-<br>
nadium, antimony, tellurium and niobium and containing<br>
a silica raw material,<br>
the silica raw material comprising 40 to 100 % by<br>
weight of (i) at least one silica sol having an average<br>
primary silica particle diameter of from 20 to 100 nm<br>
and 60 to 0 % by weight of (ii) at least one silica sol<br>
having an average primary silica particle diameter of<br>
from 5 nm to less than 20 nm, wherein the total weight<br>
of the at least one silica sol (i) and the at least one<br>
silica sol (ii) is 100 % by weight, each % by weight of<br>
a silica sol being expressed in terms of the weight of<br>
silica contained in the silica sol,<br>
spray drying the aqueous raw material mixture to<br>
thereby obtain a dried catalyst precursor, and<br>
calcining the dried catalyst precursor, thereby<br>
obtaining the catalyst of the present invention.<br>
This method for producing the catalyst of the pre-<br>
sent invention is described in detail. The method for<br>
producing the catalyst of the present invention com-<br>
prises the following steps: step (1) of providing an<br>
aqueous raw material mixture (i.e., aqueous raw mate-<br>
rial mixture preparation step), step (2) of spray dry-<br>
ing the aqueous raw material mixture to thereby obtain<br>
a dried catalyst precursor (i.e., drying step), and<br>
step (3) of calcining the dried catalyst precursor<br>
(i.e., calcination step). These steps are described<br>
hereinbelow in detail.<br>
Step (1) (aqueous raw material mixture preparation<br>
step)<br>
In step (1), an aqueous slurry of raw materials of<br>
the catalyst (i.e., aqueous raw material mixture) is<br>
prepared.  In the raw materials, each of the elements<br>
(which are to be incorporated into the catalyst), such<br>
as molybdenum, bismuth, iron, nickel, cobalt, manganese,<br>
zinc, magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, chromium,<br>
tungsten, vanadium, niobium, boron, aluminum, gallium,<br>
indium, at least one rare earth element, phosphorus.<br>
antimony, tellurium, sodium, potassium, rubidium and<br>
cesium, may be present in the form of an ammonium salt,<br>
a nitrate, a chloride, a sulfate, an organic acid salt<br>
and/or an inorganic acid, which are soluble in water or<br>
nitric acid. Especially, it is preferred that each of<br>
molybdenum, tungsten and vanadium is used in the form<br>
of an ammonium salt; that each of bismuth, iron, nickel,<br>
cobalt, manganese, zinc, magnesium, calcium, strontium,<br>
barium, chromium, aluminum, gallium, indium, at least<br>
one rare earth element, sodium, potassium, rubidium and<br>
cesium, is used in the form of a nitrate; and that each<br>
of niobium, boron, phosphorus and tellurium is used in<br>
the form of an inorganic acid. Further, with respect<br>
to the source of antimony used as a raw material of the<br>
catalyst, an antimony oxide can be advantageously used.<br>
Of these raw materials of the catalyst, with re-<br>
spect to those raw materials having poor solubility in<br>
water (e.g., sources of antimony and niobium), it is<br>
preferred that, prior to use, these raw materials are<br>
dissolved in water in the presence of a water-soluble<br>
chelating agent, such as citric acid, oxalic acid, tar-<br>
taric acid or hydrogen peroxide.<br>
With respect to niobic acid, which has poor solu-<br>
bility in water, it is preferred to improve the solu-<br>
bility of niobic acid by the method as described in Un-<br>
examined Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Specifi-<br>
cation No. Hei 11-47598; specifically, it is preferred<br>
to use niobic acid in the form of a niobic acid<br>
-containing aqueous mixture which contains niobic acid,<br>
a dicarboxylic acid (e.g. oxalic acid) and ammonia,<br>
wherein the molar ratio (dicarboxylic acid/Nb molar ra-<br>
tio) of the dicarboxylic acid to the niobic acid in<br>
terms of niobium is in the range of from 1 to 4 and the<br>
molar ratio (ammonia/Nb molar ratio) of the ammonia to<br>
the niobic acid in terms of niobium is 2 or less.<br>
Diantimony trioxide has poor solubility in water.<br>
However, diantimony trioxide can be dissolved in water<br>
by a method in which a mixture of diantimony trioxide<br>
and ammonium metavanadate or a mixture of diantimony<br>
trioxide, ammonium metavanadate and ammonium paramolyb-<br>
date, is added to water, and the resultant aqueous mix-<br>
ture is heated at a temperature in the range of from 80<br>
Â°C to the boiling point (the boiling point is generally<br>
about 100 Â°C) to thereby obtain an aqueous solution.<br>
The silica raw material used in the method of the<br>
present invention for producing the catalyst of the<br>
present invention is a silica raw material comprising<br>
40 to 100 % by weight of (i) at least one silica sol<br>
having an average primary silica particle diameter of<br>
from 20 to 100 nm and 60 to 0 % by weight of (ii) at<br>
least one silica sol having an average primary silica<br>
particle diameter of from 5 nm to less than 20 nm,<br>
wherein the total weight of the at least one silica sol<br>
(i) and the at least one silica sol (ii) is 100 % by-<br>
weight, each % by weight of a silica sol being ex-<br>
pressed in terms of the weight of silica contained in<br>
the silica sol.<br>
The aqueous slurry of raw materials of the cata-<br>
lyst (i.e., aqueous raw material mixture) can be pre-<br>
pared, for example, as follows. Aqueous solutions of<br>
ammonium salts of molybdenum, tungsten and the like are<br>
added to a silica sol (which is a silica raw material)<br>
to obtain a silica sol-containing aqueous mixture. On<br>
the other hand, nitrates of other component elements<br>
(i.e., bismuth, iron, nickel, cobalt, manganese, zinc,<br>
magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, chromium, alumi-<br>
num, gallium, indium, at least one rare earth element,<br>
sodium, potassium, rubidium and cesium) are dissolved<br>
in water or aqueous nitric acid. The resultant aqueous<br>
solution is added to the above-mentioned silica sol-<br>
containing aqueous mixture. When a fumed silica is em-<br>
ployed as a part of the silica raw material, or it is<br>
intended to prepare a phosphorus-containing catalyst,<br>
an aqueous raw material mixture is prepared as follows.<br>
An aqueous suspension of fumed silica is added to a<br>
silica sol to obtain an aqueous silica mixture, and<br>
then phosphoric acid is added to the aqueous silica<br>
mixture, followed by addition of sources of other com-<br>
ponent elements, to thereby obtain an aqueous raw mate-<br>
rial mixture. The order of mixing of the raw materials<br>
may be changed.<br>
With respect to the sources of component elements,<br>
which have poor solubility in water, these sources can<br>
be used after appropriately performing the above-<br>
mentioned treatment for improving the solubility<br>
thereof.<br>
Step (2) (drying step)<br>
In step (2), the aqueous raw material mixture ob-<br>
tained in step (1) above is subjected to spray drying,<br>
to thereby obtain spherical dried particles (i.e., a<br>
dried catalyst precursor). The spray drying of the<br>
aqueous raw material mixture can be conducted by a con-<br>
ventional method generally employed in the commercial<br>
production of a catalyst. Examples of such methods in-<br>
clude a centrifugation method, a two-phase flow nozzle<br>
method and a high pressure nozzle method. Of these, a<br>
centrifugation method is especially preferred. With<br>
respect to a heat source for drying, it is preferred to<br>
use air which has been heated by steam, an electric<br>
heater or the like. The temperature of the spray dryer<br>
at an inlet thereof is from 100 to 400 Â°C, preferably<br>
from 150 to 300 Â°C, and the temperature of the spray<br>
dryer at an outlet thereof is from 100 to 170 Â°C, pref-<br>
erably from 120 to 150 Â°C.<br>
Step (3) (calcination step)<br>
In step (3), the dried particles (i.e., a dried<br>
catalyst precursor) obtained in step (2) above are cal-<br>
cined to thereby obtain a desired catalyst.  If desired,<br>
the dried catalyst precursor may be first subjected to<br>
a preliminary calcination (which is optional) in an<br>
oxygen-containing atmosphere (e.g., air) at a tempera-<br>
ture of from 150 to 430 Â°C for 30 minutes to 10 hours,<br>
before performing a final calcination in an oxygen-<br>
containing atmosphere (e.g., air) at a temperature in<br>
the range of from 450 to 750 Â°C, preferably from 500 to<br>
700 Â°C, for 1 to 20 hours.  The preliminary calcination<br>
is optionally performed for the purpose of burning am-<br>
monium nitrates derived from the ammonium salts and ni-<br>
trates used as raw materials for the catalyst. In the<br>
preliminary calcination, if explosive burning of ammo-<br>
nium nitrates occurs, problems may be caused in that a<br>
distortion or cracking of the catalyst occurs, thus im-<br>
pairing the fluidity and attrition resistance of the<br>
catalyst. Therefore, burning of ammonium nitrates is<br>
performed slowly at a relatively low temperature. For<br>
the calcination, a kiln, such as a rotary kiln, a tun-<br>
nel kiln or a muffle kiln, can be used.<br>
Hereinbelow, an explanation is made with respect<br>
to the measurement of the particle diameter distribu-<br>
tion of the thus obtained catalyst. The "particle di-<br>
ameter distribution" is data of the weight percentages<br>
of groups of catalyst particles wherein the groups re-<br>
spectively have different specific ranges of particle<br>
diameter, based on the weight of the catalyst.  In the<br>
present invention, the measurement of the particle di-<br>
ameter distribution is performed by the following<br>
method. A sieve having a mesh size of 200 pun (manufac-<br>
tured and sold by Buckbee-Mears, U.S.A.) (upper sieve)<br>
is placed on a sieve having a mesh size of 5 Âµm (manu-<br>
factured and sold by Buckbee-Mears, U.S.A.) (lower<br>
sieve), and a receiver is provided under the lower<br>
sieve having a mesh size of 5 Âµm. A specimen of the<br>
catalyst particles is introduced onto the upper sieve,<br>
and the upper and lower sieves are shaken, thereby ef-<br>
fecting a screening of the catalyst particles. The<br>
catalyst particles which remained on the lower sieve<br>
(having a mesh size of 5 pun) are taken out and weighed.<br>
The thus obtained weight of the catalyst particles<br>
which remained on the lower sieve is divided by the<br>
weight of the catalyst particles introduced onto the<br>
upper sieve, and the resultant quotient is multiplied,<br>
by 100. The resultant product is obtained as the<br>
amount (% by weight) of catalyst particles having a<br>
particle diameter of from 5 to 200 Âµm, based on the<br>
weight of the catalyst.  In the present invention, the<br>
amount of catalyst particles having a particle diameter<br>
of from 5 to 200 Âµm is in the range of from 90 to 100 %<br>
by weight, based on the weight of the catalyst.<br>
The excellent catalyst of the present invention<br>
can be produced by the simple method as described here-<br>
inabove. The thus obtained catalyst of the present in-<br>
vention can be used for producing acrylonitrile or<br>
methacrylonitrile by reacting propylene, isobutene or<br>
tert-butyl alcohol with molecular oxygen and ammonia.<br>
The above-mentioned ammoxidation reaction is conducted<br>
in a fluidized-bed reactor.  Propylene, isobutene,<br>
tert-butyl alcohol and ammonia used in the present in-<br>
vention need not be of a very high purity but may be of<br>
a commercial grade. As a source of molecular oxygen,<br>
air is usually preferred. Gas having an increased oxy-<br>
gen content such as a gaseous mixture of air and oxygen,<br>
is also usable.  In the ammoxidation reaction, the mo-<br>
lar ratios of propylene, isobutene or tert-butyl alco-<br>
hol : ammonia : molecular oxygen used as gaseous raw<br>
materials for the ammoxidation are generally in the<br>
range of 1 : 0.8 to 1.4 : 1.4 to 2.4, preferably 1 :<br>
0.9 to 1.3 : 1.6 to 2.2. The reaction temperature may-<br>
be from 350 to 550 Â°C, preferably from 400 to 500 Â°C.<br>
The reaction may usually be conducted under a pressure<br>
of from atmospheric pressure to 0.3 MPa. The time of<br>
contact (contact time) between a gaseous mixture of raw<br>
materials and the catalyst may be from 0.5 to 20<br>
(sec-g/cc), preferably from 1 to 10 (secg/cc).<br>
In the present invention, the contact time is de-<br>
fined by the following formula:<br>
contact time (sec-g/cc) = (W/F) x 273/(273 + T) x<br>
P/0.10<br>
wherein:<br>
W represents the weight (g) of the catalyst,<br>
F represents the flow rate (Ncc/sec) of the gase-<br>
ous raw material mixture in the normal state (0 "C,<br>
1 atm),<br>
T represents the reaction temperature (Â°C), and<br>
P represents the reaction pressure (MPa).<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Hereinbelow, the present invention will be de-<br>
scribed in more detail with reference to the following<br>
Examples and Comparative Examples, which should not be<br>
construed as limiting the scope of the present inven-<br>
tion.<br>
In the following Examples and Comparative Examples,<br>
the particle diameter distribution of a catalyst was<br>
measured using a sieve.  Specifically, the measurement<br>
of the particle diameter distribution was performed by<br>
the following method. A sieve having a mesh size of<br>
200 Âµm (manufactured and sold by Buckbee-Mears, U.S.A.)<br>
(upper sieve) was placed on a sieve having a mesh size<br>
of 5 [tin (manufactured and sold by Buckbee-Mears,<br>
U.S.A.) (lower sieve), and a receiver was provided un-<br>
der the lower sieve having a mesh size of 5 Âµm.  A<br>
specimen of the catalyst particles was introduced onto<br>
the upper sieve, and the upper and lower sieves were<br>
shaken, thereby effecting a screening of the catalyst<br>
particles. The catalyst particles which remained on<br>
the lower sieve (having a mesh size of 5 Âµm) were taken<br>
out and weighed. The thus obtained weight of the cata-<br>
lyst particles which remained on the lower sieve was<br>
divided by the weight of the catalyst particles intro-<br>
duced onto the upper sieve, and the resultant quotient<br>
was multiplied by 100. The resultant product was ob-<br>
tained as the amount (% by weight) of catalyst parti-<br>
cles having a particle diameter of from 5 to 200 Âµm.<br>
based on the weight of the catalyst.  It was found that,<br>
with respect to all catalysts obtained in the Examples<br>
and Comparative Examples, the amount of catalyst parti-<br>
cles having a particle diameter of from 5 to 200 Âµm was<br>
100 % by weight, based on the weight of the catalyst.<br>
In the Examples and Comparative Examples, the con-<br>
version and yield used for evaluating the results of<br>
the reaction are defined as follows:<br>
Conversion (%) = (mole of propylene reacted) /<br>
(mole of propylene fed) x 100<br>
Yield of acrylonitrile (%) = (mole of acryloni-<br>
trile formed) / (mole of propylene fed) x 100<br>
A Pyrex glass fluidized-bed reactor tube having an<br>
inner diameter of 25 mm was used as a reaction appara-<br>
tus. The reaction pressure (P) was maintained at 0.15<br>
MPa, and the amount (W) of a catalyst charged in the<br>
reactor was 40 to 60 g. The flow rate (F) of a gaseous<br>
raw material mixture introduced into the reactor was<br>
250 to 450 Ncc/sec (in terms of the value as measured<br>
in the normal state (0 Â°C, 1 atm)), and the reaction<br>
temperature (T) was maintained at 430 Â°C.<br>
In the present invention, the contact time is de-<br>
fined by the following formula:<br>
contact time (sec-g/cc) = (W/F) x 273/(273 + T) x<br>
P/0.10<br>
wherein:<br>
W represents the weight (g) of the catalyst,<br>
F represents the flow rate (Ncc/sec) of the gase-<br>
ous raw material mixture in the normal state (0 Â°C,<br>
1 atm),<br>
T represents the reaction temperature (Â°C), and<br>
P represents the reaction pressure (MPa).<br>
The composition of the gaseous raw material mix-<br>
ture introduced into the reactor was as follows:<br>
propylene / ammonia / air = 1 / 1.25 / 8.0 to 10.0<br>
(1.6 to 2.0 in terms of molecular oxygen).<br>
For the evaluation of the attrition resistance of<br>
the catalysts obtained in the Examples and Comparative<br>
Examples, the attrition loss of each of the catalysts<br>
was measured in accordance with the ACC method.  The<br>
attrition loss is defined by the following formula:<br>
attrition loss (%) = B / (C-A) x 100<br>
wherein:<br>
A is the weight (g) of the catalyst which is lost<br>
by attrition in the period of from 0 hour point<br>
to 5 hour point after the start of the attrition<br>
resistance test;<br>
B is the weight (g) of the catalyst which is lost<br>
by attrition in the period of from 5 hour point<br>
to 120 hour point after the start of the attri-<br>
tion resistance test; and<br>
C is the weight (g) of the catalyst used in the<br>
attrition resistance test.<br>
When the catalyst exhibits an attrition loss of<br>
7 % or less, it is judged that the catalyst has a sat-<br>
isfactorily high attrition resistance which renders the<br>
catalyst suitable for commercial use.<br>
Example 1<br>
An ammoxidation catalyst comprised of a metal ox-<br>
ide supported on a silica carrier which was present in<br>
an amount of 50 % by weight, based on the total weight<br>
of the metal oxide and the silica carrier, wherein the<br>
metal oxide had a metal composition represented by the<br>
formula:<br>
Mo12Bi0.45Ce0.90Fe1.8Ni2.0Co3.0Mg2. 0K0.o9Rbo. 05<br>
was prepared as follows.<br>
42.2 g of bismuth nitrate [Bi(NO3)3"5H2O] . 75.5 g<br>
of cerium nitrate [Ce(NO3)3-6H2O] , 140.5 g of iron ni-<br>
trate [Fe(NO3)3-9H2O] , 112.4 g of nickel nitrate<br>
[Ni(NO3)2â¢6H2O] , 168.8 g of cobalt nitrate<br>
[Co(N03)2â¢6H20] , 99.1 g of magnesium nitrate<br>
[Mg(NO3)2â¢6H2O] , 1.76 g of potassium nitrate [KNO3] and<br>
1.43 g of rubidium nitrate [RbNO3] were dissolved in<br>
405.3 g of a 16.6 % by weight aqueous nitric acid solu-<br>
tion. The resultant solution was added to 1,666.7 g of<br>
an aqueous silica sol having an SiO2 content of 30 % by<br>
weight and an average primary silica particle diameter<br>
of 22 nm, to obtain a mixture.  To the thus obtained<br>
mixture was added a solution of 409.4 g of ammonium pa-<br>
ramolybdate [ (NH4)6Mo7024-4H20] in 824.7 g of water, to<br>
thereby obtain an aqueous raw material mixture.  The<br>
thus obtained aqueous raw material mixture was fed to a<br>
parallel flow type spray-drying apparatus, in which the<br>
aqueous raw material mixture was atomized by means of a<br>
sprayer having a dish type rotor disposed above the<br>
central portion of a dryer of the spray-drying appara-<br>
tus, and dried while maintaining the inlet temperature<br>
of the dryer at about 2 50 Â° C and the outlet temperature<br>
of the dryer at about 140 Â°C, to thereby obtain parti-<br>
cles (i.e., a dried catalyst precursor). The dried<br>
catalyst precursor was subjected to a preliminary cal-<br>
cination in air in an electric kiln at 350 Â°C for 1<br>
hour and then subjected to a final calcination in air<br>
at 580 Â°C for 2 hours, thereby obtaining a catalyst.<br>
With respect to the obtained catalyst, a measure-<br>
ment of the pore distribution was performed. As a re-<br>
sult , it was found that the cumulative pore volume of<br>
pores having a pore diameter of 80 A or less was 0.005<br>
cc/g, the cumulative pore volume of pores having a pore<br>
diameter of 1,000 A or more was 0.012 cc/g, and the to-<br>
tal pore volume of the catalyst was 0.232 cc/g.  That<br>
is, the cumulative pore volume of pores having a pore<br>
diameter of 80 A or less was 2.2 %, and the cumulative<br>
pore volume of pores having a pore diameter of 1,000 A<br>
or more was 5.2 %, each based on the total pore volume<br>
of the catalyst.<br>
Using 50 g of the obtained catalyst, an ammoxida-<br>
tion reaction of propylene was conducted. The contact<br>
time in the ammoxidation reaction was 4.3 (secg/cc).<br>
Results of the reaction were evaluated 24 hours after<br>
the start of the reaction. As a result, it was found<br>
that the conversion of propylene was 99.0 %, and the<br>
yield of acrylonitrile was 84.0 %.<br>
50 g of the obtained catalyst was subjected to an<br>
attrition resistance test in accordance with the ACC<br>
method. As a result, the catalyst exhibited an attri-<br>
tion loss (%) of 5.7 %. The composition of the cata-<br>
lyst and the production conditions for the catalyst are<br>
shown in Table 1. The pore distribution and attrition<br>
resistance (in terms of the attrition loss (%)) of the<br>
catalyst, and the results of the ammoxidation reaction<br>
are shown in Table 2.<br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
An ammoxidation catalyst was prepared in substan-<br>
tially the same manner as in Example 1, except that<br>
1,666.7 g of an aqueous silica sol having an SiO2 con-<br>
tent of 30 % by weight and an average primary silica<br>
particle diameter of 12 nm was used alone as a silica<br>
raw material and that the final calcination temperature<br>
was 590 Â°C.<br>
With respect to the obtained catalyst, a measure-<br>
ment of the pore distribution was performed. As a re-<br>
sult, it was found that the cumulative pore volume of<br>

cc/g, the cumulative pore volume of pores having a pore<br>
diameter of 1,000 A or more was 0.001 cc/g, and the to-<br>
tal pore volume of the catalyst was 0.220 cc/g. That<br>
is, the cumulative pore volume of pores having a pore<br>
diameter of 80 A or less was 26.4 %, and the cumulative<br>
pore volume of pores having a pore diameter of 1,000 A<br>
or more was 0.5 %, each based on the total pore volume<br>
of the catalyst.<br>
Using 50 g of the obtained catalyst, an ammoxida-<br>
tion reaction of propylene was conducted. The contact<br>
time in the ammoxidation reaction was 3.7 (secg/cc).<br>
Results of the reaction were evaluated 24 hours after<br>
the start of the reaction. As a result, it was found<br>
that the conversion of propylene was 99.1 %, and the<br>
yield of acrylonitrile was 82.4 %.<br>
50 g of the obtained catalyst was subjected to an<br>
attrition resistance test in accordance with the ACC<br>

lyst and the production conditions for the catalyst are<br>
shown in Table 1. The pore distribution and attrition<br>
resistance (in terms of the attrition loss (%)) of the<br>
catalyst, and the results of the ammoxidation reaction<br>

cc/g, the cumulative pore volume of pores having a pore<br>
diameter of 1,000 A or more was 0.271 cc/g, and the to-<br>
