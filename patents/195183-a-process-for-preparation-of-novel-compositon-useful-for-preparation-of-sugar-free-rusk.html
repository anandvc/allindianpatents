				<td>The present invention relates to a process for preparation of novel composition for preparation of sugar free rusk .<br>
The bakery industry in India has now occupied a significant place in industrial sector. It represents one of the largest organised food processing activities in the country. The bakery industry in India is a Rs. 5,000 crore turn over industry. (Vikas Singhal, 1999. Indian Agriculture, Indian Economic Data Research centre, pp 72-83). The bakery industry produces a variety of products of fairly good nutritional value to cater to all sections of population. The consumption of these products is on the rise owing to the popularity which can be attributed to the factors like easy, availability of these products in different tastes, flavour, texture, convenience etc. Though umpteen varieties of bakery products are produced, suitable therapeutic bakery products specially suited for the use of diabetic subjects are currently not being manufactured. Bakery products can also be engineered in such a fashion that they meet the specific therapeutic needs of consumers. Some of these products are gluten free bread, sugar free bread, sugar free biscuits, low salt products etc. These products still do not exist in Indian markets. (Sharma, H. K., Singh, S. T. M and Goyal P. 1998. Bakery products in Next Millenium. Beverage &amp; Food World, Nov-Dec, pp 40,46). Sugar free rusk is one such novel product which will cater to the needs of the diabetic population in India. It is reported that there are 25 million diabetic patients in India. The therapeutic bakery products sector needs to be exploited and is a good growth potential for the industries which manufacture these products as the health awareness is on the rise. Moreover, sugar free rusk can be produced with the already existing facilities in the bakery.<br>
Polyols like sorbitol, xylitol, mannitol, maltitol, lactitol either alone or in combination find use in the development of sugar free products. The polyols exhibit some favourable metabolic effects by avoiding high blood glucose peaks because of their slower absorption in the intestine (Dwidendi B.K 1977. Absorption metabolism and application of polyols in carbohydrates and Health, Van Nostrend Reinhold, AVI, New York). Sorbitol enters the normal metabolic pathway for sugars at the level of fructose due to the enzyme sorbitol dehydrogenase present mainly in the liver, prostrate and kidneys. The subsequent breakdown is via an insulin independent mechanism. Thus, sorbitol can replace glucose and sucrose in the diets of diabetics. (Fausto. F Dias, 1999 Indian Food Industry 18: 229-237).<br>
Reference may be made to Andersen, Geert, US Patent No. 4292337 (1981) wherein a Chewy sugar free confectionery was produced based on sorbitol and a sugar-free swelling agent wherein atleast one sugar-free swelling agent is dissolved with xylitol and sorbitol in water to form a clear solution. The resulting material is boiled to the consistency required for the further treatment and to a residual water content of 0.5 to 3 wt.% after which the desired aromatic substances, flavourings, acid and /or dyes are introduced or formed in the material, if desired. This confectionery material can be used for producing any required confectionery, for example filled or unfilled hard and soft caramels, or sweets, foamed confectionery and particularly chewy sweets. The draw back of the process is that it cannot be used for the production of rusks as the formulation and processing conditions are different.<br>
Reference may be made to Kim, Jong, C. US patent No. 4442132 (1984) wherein a process for the preparation of light bakery products for diabetics is given. It consisted of digest'ble carbohydrate content of less than 10% jy weight and prepared from a dough consisting essentially of a major amount of egg in the form of whole egg or egg albumin, 2-30% by weight of a protein containing flour substitute of which atleast 50% by weight is supplied by calcium caseinate, wheat flour in an amount upto 15% by weight of the total mixture, 3-40% by weight of minced nuts, 5-50% by weight of sugar alcohol selected from the group consisting of lactitol, sorbitol and xylitol and 0% by weight of sugar and wherein the weight % of wheat flour is less than the weight % of flour substitute. The flour substitute and sugar alcohol may be formulated with the other starting materials and blended to a dough or batter in accordance with the usual baking techniques and baked at about 180°C for about 20 min. The drawback of this process is that egg, nuts and calcium caseinate do not form the ingredients for the preparation of rusk.<br>
Reference may be made to Venkateswara Rao, G. Indrani, D, 1989, Journal of Food Science and Technology 26: 142-144 wherein sweet bread and biscuits were made by replacing sugar with saccharin, aspartame and acesulfame-K intended for the use of diabetic subjects. The drawback of the process is that it describes only bread and biscuits and not rusks. Also artificial sweeteners have been used which are not permitted by law to be used in bakery products.<br>
Reference may be made here to Klacik Kenneth, J, Vink Walter. V, Fronczkowski Paul. R., US Patent No. 4452825 (1984) wherein a clear amorphous sugar free hard<br>
candy prepared on a continuos basis from an aqueous sorbitol solution by heating such solution to a moisture content level of less than about 5% by weight and then cooling the resulting mass to a temperature of from about 160°F to about 200°F before providing crystal nucleation sites sufficient to obtain a hard candy. The drawback of the process is that it relates to production of hard candy which is different from bakery product as rusk in all aspects.<br>
Reference may be made here to Frye. A. M, C.S. Setser, 1991, Cereal Chemistry 69: 338-343 where in reduced calorie yellow layer cakes were made by using six bulking agents sorbitol, a hydrogenated starch hydrolysate mixture, lactitol, isomalt, 18 DE maltodextrin, and polydextrose in combination to totally or partially replace sucrose. The texture attributes of this reduced calorie, shortening free cakes were rated between those of a commercial pound cake and yellow layer cake. The drawback is that the process is about reduced calorie cake with different formulation and processing conditions in relation to rusks.<br>
Reference may be made here to Finney. P. L, Ruben thaler. G.L., Jeffers. H.C and Anderson. P. D., 1977, Cereal Chemistry 54:1259-1263 wherein breads with equal loaf volume and crumb grain were produced using a sugar free formula by using different levels of diastatic malt. Sucrose was reduced to 0% in 180 min fermentation system by increasing various active malted wheats and barleys by a factor of four. The drawback is the use of malted wheat and barley as a-amylase source in the production of sugar free bread and not using sugar substitute.<br>
Reference may be made here to Magoffin, CD, Finney. P. L and K.F. Finney, 1977 Cereal Chemistry 54:760-769 wherein high protein breads were made with sugar free formula. The resultant bread had high volume and well structured crumb grain. Effect of adding sucrose palmitate, shortening, sodium stearoyl-2-lactylate and a combination of shortening and SSL were also studied. The drawback is the production of high protein bread with sugar free formulation. The product is bread and not rusk. Also the product is not sweet as it does not contain any sweetening agents.<br>
Reference may be made here to Kamel. B.S., Rasper. V. R, 1988. Journal of Texture studies 19:307-320 wherein reduced calorie cakes were made from a non shortening formula in which sucrose was partially replaced by either sorbitol or polydextrose and emulsifiers Atlas A (sorbitan monostearate and polysorbate 60) and Tandem 22H (mono and diglycerides and polysorbate 60), MD -SSL (mono and di glyceride and sodium stearoyl lactylate) were used singly at different levels to improve the texture of the cakes. The drawback is the production of only reduced calorie cake using a non-shortening formula and emulsifiers where in sucrose was partially replaced. The product described is cake and not the rusk.<br>
A reference may be made to Williams and David Arthur US Patent No. US 3989858 (1976) wherein a rusk based food snack was made by frying in hot oil thin<br>
pieces of dough made from rusk crumbs, starch, water, flavouring and emulsifying<br>
ingredients. The product had dense surface layers and porous interiors. The drawback of<br>
the process is the production of rusk based food snack by frying in oil and it is not a sugar<br>
free product.<br>
A reference may be made here to Stilling and Birgitte US patent No 5698256 (1997) where in a bread product having a bread sugar reducing effect for diabetics is manufactured by baking a dough consisting of soya protein, a fibre component comprising atleast 50% by weight of wheat bran, vegetable oil, a fat containing, substantially starch-free nut and / or kernel component, a low fat sour milk product, egg white and a leavening agent. The draw back of the process is that it is a fibre rich product and it is not a sugar substituted product. The product described was similar to bread which is an intermediate moisture food and not a low moisture rusk type of product.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparation of composition useful for preparation of sugar free rusk .<br>

Experiments were conducted by preparing rusk in order to find out the appropriate ratio of the flour in sponge and dough and thereby its effect on the quality of product.<br>
Evaluation of the rusks prepared with the above formulation showed that the specific volume of the rusk was 3.0 ml/g and weight of each rusk was 6.4 g<br>
Sensory evaluation of the rusks indicated that the sweetness was optimum and taste was acceptable. But the crumb colour of the rusks were dull white and the grain consisted of compact and closed cells which made the texture hard. This was reflected in the breaking strength values which was 3.4 kg.<br>

Objective evaluation of the rusks showed that the volume increased as shown by specific volume of 3.2 ml/g of rusk and the weight of the rusk was 6.3g.<br>
This formulation yielded a better quality product. The colour of the crumb improved to light brown colour and the crumb grain consisted of slightly opened cells giving the product a better texture when compared with the product in example 1. There was a reduction in breaking strength which was 3.2 kg. The sweetness was optimum and taste was good.<br>

In order to aid in the production of CO2 which would result in light and crisp product, fungal amylase was added at the sponge stage. This experiment was also carried out to know the optimum level of enzyme addition.<br>
The evaluation of the rusks showed that the specific volume improved and it was 3.6 ml/g and the weight of the rusk was and 6. lg.<br>
The sensory evaluation of the rusks indicated that it resulted in a better product in terms of colour, texture and crispness. The crumb colour improved to golden brown and the crumb grain was open and slightly coarse. However, the texture was crisp and product was light. This was indicated in the breaking strength value which was 1.9 kg.<br>

Experiment was carried out with the increase in the level of fungal a-amylase.<br>
The results of the experiment showed that the specific volume improved to 4,5 ml/g and the weight of the rusk was 5.8 g<br>
The sensory evaluation showed that the sweetness was optimum and taste was good. The product became slightly fragile and light. The breaking strength was 1.7 kg.<br>
The crumb colour was golden brown. However, an increase in the level of enzyme did not have much advantage as the cells were coarse which is not desirable.<br>

The experiment has the use of 0.5% emulsifier A i.e Glycerol monostearate.<br>
The emulsifier glycerol monostearate in the form of gel was used in the formulation to bring about improvement in the texture.<br>
The objective evaluation of the rusk showed that the specific volume of the rusk was 3.6 ml/g. The weight of the rusk was 6.1g. The sensory evaluation of the rusk showed that the crumb colour was golden brown, crumb grain medium fine and texture crisp. The breaking strength of the rusk was 2 kg.<br>

The combination of emulsifiers  glycerol  monostearate and sodium stearoyl lactylate was tried for further improvement in the quality of rusk.<br>
The data on rusk prepared using different examples is presented in table 1<br>
Table 1: Effect of varying flour ratio, fungal α-amylase and surfactants on the quality of sugar free rusks  <br>
(Table Removed)<br>
* breaking strength measured using texture analyser<br>
GMS : Glycerol monostearate (emulsifier A), SSL : Sodium stearoyi -2- lactylate (emulsifier B)<br>
The objective evaluation of the product showed that the specific volume was 4.0 ml/g and the weight of the rusk was 6 g.<br>
The sensory evaluation of the rusk showed that the crumb colour was appealing golden brown. There was a marked improvement in crumb grain and the use of combination of emulsifiers glycerol monostearate and sodium stearoyl lactylate. It produced the best grain and it was fine which is desirable in rusk. The texture of the product was crisp and light. The breaking strength of the rusk was 2.1 kg which was considered optimum. The sweetness was optimum. The overall quality of the product was very good and hence highly acceptable.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
