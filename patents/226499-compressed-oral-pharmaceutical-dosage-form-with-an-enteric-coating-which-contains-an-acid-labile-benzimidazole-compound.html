				<td>COMPRESSED ORAL PHARMACEUTICAL DOSAGE FORM, WITH AN ENTERIC<br>
COATING, WHICH CONTAINS AN ACID-LABILE BENZIMIDAZOLE COMPOUND<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to new tableted<br>
pharmaceutical dosage forms, covered with an enteric<br>
coating, consisting of a plurality of units containing a<br>
benzimidazole compound labile in an acid medium, suitable<br>
for oral administration. The invention also relates to<br>
the process for preparing said pharmaceutical dosage<br>
forms and to their use in human and animal health care.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Omeprazole, 5-methoxy-2-[[(4-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-<br>
2-pyridyl)methyl]sulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazole, is a<br>
benzimidazole compound that can inhibit gastric secretion<br>
in mammals, so that it is useful for preventing and<br>
treating disorders related to secretion of gastric acid,<br>
such as gastric ulcers, duodenal ulcers, reflux<br>
oesophagitis, Zolliger-Ellison syndrome, etc. Other<br>
benzimidazole compounds with antiulcerous activity are<br>
pantoprazole, lansoprazole and rabeprazole.<br>
Omeprazole, as other benzimidazole compounds of<br>
therapeutic interest, is labile in an acid medium, which<br>
creates a great number of problems when developing a<br>
pharmaceutical form meant for oral administration as said<br>
compound breaks down upon contact with the stomach<br><br>
contents, a strongly acidic medium. Its labile nature may<br>
be responsible for the variability in the intra- and<br>
inter-individual therapeutic response of omeprazole.<br>
To prevent contact between compounds labile in an<br>
acid medium and gastric juice after oral administration<br>
of said compounds, solid pharmaceutical forms have been<br>
developed that comprise a core containing the compound<br>
labile in an acid medium and an outer layer that provides<br>
a gastro-resistant coating, which can be separated by one<br>
or more intermediate layers. In certain cases it is not<br>
possible to use conventional enteric coatings of acidic<br>
nature as the active compound would break down upon<br>
direct or indirect contact with said coating, as made<br>
manifest by a change in color and a degradation of the<br>
active compound over time.<br>
There exist several ways of solving the problem of<br>
stability of the active compound. One of them consists of<br>
creating an alkaline environment around the<br>
benzimidazole compound labile in an acid medium, which is<br>
achieved by using alkaline salts of the benzimidazole<br>
compound and/or by incorporating an alkaline reacting<br>
compound in the gastrc-resistant pharmaceutical<br>
preparation [see, for example, European Patent<br>
Application EP 0 244 380 and American Patent US<br>
4,786,505]. Another way of solving the problem of<br>
stability of the active compound is the creation of a<br>
physical barrier that manages to separate completely the<br>
active compound and the enteric layer, thereby preventing<br>
any degradation of the active compound, and involves the<br><br>
use of pharmaceutically acceptable excipients with the<br>
exception of those giving an alkaline reaction [see, for<br>
example, European Patent EP 0 773 025].<br>
Patent application WO 96/01623 describes a multiple<br>
unit tableted dosage form containing omeprazole or an<br>
alkaline salt thereof, consisting of units arranged in<br>
layers containing the active compound and individually<br>
coated with an enteric coating. Such units arranged as<br>
enteric coated layers are mixed with excipients for<br>
tablets and are tableted together.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention addresses the problem of developing<br>
new pharmaceutical dosage forms, enteric coated, for oral<br>
administration, meant to increase the number of available<br>
means for the effective administration of benzimidazole<br>
compounds labile in an acid medium.<br>
The solution provided by tnis invention is based on<br>
the inventors' observation that tableted oral<br>
pharmaceutical dosage forms covered with an enteric<br>
coating and consisting of multiple units containing a<br>
benzimidazole compound labile in an acid medium are<br>
stable and useful for effective administration of<br>
benzimidazole compounds labile in an acid medium.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention provides a tableted oral<br><br>
pharmaceutical dosage form, covered with an enteric<br>
coating, consisting of a plurality of units containing a<br>
benzimidazole compound labile in an acid medium as the<br>
active principle, hereinafter referred to as the dosage<br>
form of the invention, that comprises:<br>
(a)	A plurality of units containing a benzimidazole<br>
compound labile in an acid medium as the active<br>
principle that comprise:<br>
i) an inert core;<br>
ii) an active layer deposited on said inert<br>
core i), formed by a benzimidazole<br>
compound labile in an acid medium, a non-<br>
alkaline water-soluble inert polymer and<br>
one or more pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
inert excipients; and<br>
iii) an intermediate layer comprising of an<br>
inert non-alkaline coating formed by a<br>
non-alkaline, water-soluble inert polymer<br>
and one or more pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable inert excipients, with said<br>
intermediate layer being disposed over the<br>
aforementioned active layer ii) that<br>
covers the inert core 1);<br>
(b)	one or more pharmaceutically acceptable inert<br>
excipients, of which one or more are<br>
compression excipients; and<br><br>
(c) an enteric coating layer that coats said<br>
plurality of units containing a berizimidazole<br>
compound labile in an acid medium as the active<br>
principle and said pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
inert excipients (b).<br>
In the sense used in this specification, the term<br>
"benzimidazole compound labile in an acid medium"<br>
includes benzimidazole compounds of therapeutic interest<br>
with a half-life under 10 minutes in an aqueous solution<br>
of pH less than 4, and/or a half-life between 10 minutes<br>
and 65 hours in an aqueous solution with a pH of 7, such<br>
as for example omeprazole, lansoprazole, pantcprazole and<br>
rabeprazole or their corresponding enantiomers.<br>
wherein<br>
R1 is hydrogen, methoxy or difluoromethoxy,<br>
In a specific embodiment, said benzimidazole<br>
compound labile in an acid medium is a compound of 2-[(2-<br>
pyridyl)methylsulfinyl]benzimidazole with the formula (I)<br>
or its enantiomers<br><br><br>
R2 is methyl or methoxy,<br>
R3 is methoxy, 2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy or 3-<br>
methoxypropoxy, and<br>
R4 is hydrogen or methyl.<br>
The inert core (i) is a pharmaceutically inert<br>
substance in relation to the active principle. That is,<br>
it does not react with the active principle under the<br>
conditions used to cause its decomposition, and may<br>
consist of a sugar, such as saccharose, starch and the<br>
mixtures thereof. In a specific embodiment, said inert<br>
cores consist of a mixture of saccharose and corn starch,<br>
and have an average grain size of between 0.25 and 1.4 mm<br>
and meet the requirements of the USP (United States<br>
Pharmacopoeia) [Monograph on Sugar Spheres, USF NF 18] .<br>
In a specific embodiment, the inert cores (i) are present<br>
in the unit constituting the dosage form of the invention<br>
in an amount between 5% and 35% by weight with respect to<br>
the total weight of the unit.<br>
The active layer (ii) comprises a berizimidazole<br>
compound labile in an acid medium, preferably a compound<br>
of formula (I), for example, omeprazole or one of its<br>
individual R or S enantiomers, a non-alkaline, water-<br>
soluble inert polymer such as hydroxypropylmethyl<br>
cellulose (HPMC) or hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC). In the<br>
sense used in this specification the term "inert" applied<br>
to a polymer or excipient indicates that said compound<br>
does not react under the conditions used. In a particular<br>
embodiment, the active layer (ii) is present in the unit<br>
constituting the dosage form of the invention in an<br><br>
amount between 1.6% and 35% by weight with respect to the<br>
total weight of the unit.<br>
The intermediate layer (iii) comprises an inert<br>
non-alkaline coating consisting of an inert, non-alkaline<br>
water-soluble polymer such as HPMC or HPC, and one or<br>
more pharmaceutically acceptable inert excipients, such<br>
as a pigment, for example titanium dioxide. In a specific<br>
embodiment, the intermediate layer (iii) is present in<br>
the unit constituting the dosage form of the invention in<br>
an amount between 0.5% and 15% by weight with respect to<br>
the total weight of the unit.<br>
The dosage form of the invention additionally<br>
comprises one or more pharmaceutically acceptable inert<br>
excipients of which one or more are compression<br>
excipients, such as diluents, for example<br>
microcrystalline cellulose, disintegrants, for example,<br>
crospovidone, and lubricants, for example, magnesium<br>
stearate. In a specific embodiment, said compression<br>
excipients are present in the dosage form of the<br>
invention in an amount between 40% and 80% by weight with<br>
respect to the total weight of the dosage form.<br>
The outer layer of the dosage form of the invention<br>
comprises an enteric coating that comprises a gastro-<br>
resistant polymer, such as a methacrylic copolymer, for<br>
example a copolymer formed by methacrylic acid and esters<br>
of methacrylic acid, a plasticiser such as triethyl<br>
acetate or the like, and one or mere pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable inert excipients, such as talc. In a specific<br><br>
embodiment, said outer enteric coating is present in the<br>
dosage form of the invention in an amount between 4% and<br>
30% by weight with respect to the total weight of the<br>
dosage form. The outer layer of the dosage form of the<br>
invention can contain, in addition, a colored coating<br>
comprising a mixture of colorants and opacifiers<br>
together with other pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
excipients, such as a mixture of polydextrose, HPMC,<br>
titanium dioxide, PEG 400 and colorants. The colored<br>
coating layer can be mixed with the outer enteric coating<br>
layer to define a single outer layer. In a specific<br>
embodiment, said colored layer is present in the dosage<br>
form, of the invention in an amount between 1.5% and 15%<br>
by weight with respect to the total weight of the dosage<br>
form..<br>
The units containing a benzimidazole compound<br>
labile in an acid medium as the active principle can be<br>
obtained by conventional techniques. A review of the<br>
various techniques for preparing said units with<br>
therapeutic applications can be found in the book<br>
Pharmaceutical Pelletization Technology, published by<br>
Isaac Ghebre-Sellassie, Marcel Dekker, Inc., 1989. In a<br>
specific embodiment, said units are obtained applying the<br>
various layers with conventional fluidised bed coating<br>
techniques, using aqueous solutions or suspensions of the<br>
components of said layers. In short, in a fluidised bed<br>
apparatus the inert cores are covered with a first layer<br>
containing the benzimidazole compound labile in an acia<br>
medium and a non-alkaline, water-soluble inert polymer,<br>
such as HPMC or HPC. Afterwards said active layer is<br><br>
covered with an intermediate layer containing a non-<br>
alkaline inert coating formed by a non-alkaline, water-<br>
soluble inert polymer, such as HPMC or HPC, and one or<br>
more pharmaceutically acceptable inert excipients, for<br>
example a pigment such as titanium dioxide.<br>
The dosage form of the invention can be obtained by<br>
conventional techniques by a process that involves mixing<br>
a plurality of units containing a benzimidazole compound<br>
labile in an acid medium as an active principle with one<br>
or more compression excipients, and compressing the<br>
resulting mixture. Compression can be effected by dry or<br>
wet methods. A review of the various methods for<br>
preparing tablets is mentioned, for example, in the<br>
Tratado de Farmacia Galenica (Treatise of Gallenic<br>
Pharmacy) , C. Fauli i Trillo, Luzan 5, S.A. de Ediciones<br>
(1993), Chapter 36, pages 521-541.<br>
The active principles can be administered in the<br>
same doses and with the same protocols as those of the<br>
commercially available pharmaceutical forms. In general,<br>
the dose of active principle is between approximately 5<br>
mg/day and 100 mg/day, adjusted to the individual needs<br>
of the patient and according to the specialist's<br>
considerations.<br>
The dosage form of the invention is resistant to<br>
solution in an acid medium, stable when passing through<br>
the gastric juice and allows liberating the active<br>
principle in an alkaline or neutral aqueous medium, the<br>
characteristic conditions of the proximal area of the<br><br>
small intestine.<br>
The invention also provides a method for preventing<br>
and treating disorders related to an abnormal secretion<br>
of gastric acid, comprising administering a<br>
therapeutically affective amount of the pharmaceutical<br>
dosage form of the invention to a patient suffering from<br>
an abnormal secretion of gastric acid.<br>
The following example is shown by way of<br>
illustration of the invention, and should not be<br>
understood as limiting its scope.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
Enteric tablets comprising multiple units containing<br>
omeprazole<br>
A suspension of the active principle is prepared<br>
dispersing 1,250 g of the active principle [omeprazole or<br>
lansoprazole] and 478.73 g of HPMC in 4,033 g of purified<br>
(deionised) water.<br>
In a fluidised bed apparatus are introduced<br>
2,791.69 g of inert cores, spherical, of uniform size<br>
0.25-0.355 mm of saccharose, over which the suspension<br>
obtained previously is sprayed.<br>
In 2,855.5 g of purified water are dispersed 427.2 6<br>
g of HPMC and 56.83 g of titanium dioxide and the<br>
resulting aqueous suspension is sprayed over the spheres<br>
obtained previously. After spraying and before applying<br><br>
the next layer the spheres thus obtained are dried.<br>
Then 1,988 g of said spheres are mixed with<br>
4,783.7 g of microcrystalline cellulose, 40 3.4 g of<br>
crospovidone and 24.8 g of magnesium stearate and<br>
compressed.<br>
In 331.04 g of purified water are dispersed 33.104<br>
g of a mixture of polydextrose, HPMC,, titanium dioxide,<br>
PEG 400 and colorants E110/E124/E132 and the resulting<br>
suspension is sprayed over 300 g of the previously<br>
obtained tablets. After spraying and before applying the<br>
next layer the spheres thus obtained are dried.<br>
In 170.67 g of purified water are dispersed<br>
176.28 g of methacrylic acid - ethyl acrylate copolymer<br>
of USP/Ph.Eur. grade, 7.4 g of triethyl citrate and 5.31<br>
g of talc, and the resulting aqueous suspension is<br>
sprayed over the tablets coated with the colored layer<br>
previously obtained. After spraying and applying this<br>
enteric coating layer the resulting tablets, with an<br>
enteric coating layer, are dried.<br><br>
