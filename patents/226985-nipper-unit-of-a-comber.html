The invention relates to a nipper unit of a comber comprising a nipper frame which can be moved to and fro, which has a cushion plate which can form a nip with an upper cushion plate movably mounted in the nipper frame in the area of the cushion plate lip and comprising a feed roller mounted in the nipper frame which cooperates with a feeding trough above the cushion plate for transport of the fibre material wherein a pair of detaching rollers mounted in the machine frame is positioned after the nipper unit and at least one nip for the fibre material is provided between the feeding trough and the feed roller.<br>
Such a design can be deduced for example, from the literature "The short-staple spinning mill, vol. 3: combing room, drafting, flyers - The Textile Institute / W. Klein" from pages 22 to 24.<br>
EP-0 816 540 also discloses a design where a feeding trough is attached above a cushion plate, which cooperates with a feed roller. In order to vary the nip line between the feed roller and the feeding trough, in this case the feeding trough is fixed adjustably in relation to the position of the feed roller. In addition, the device shown has an additional deflecting element following a first deflection at the feeding trough in order to increase the adhesive force of the fibres inside the mass of fibres and thus better control floating fibres.<br>
This first deflection in the example of EP-0 816 540 in the area of the exit region of the feeding trough defines the last nip between the feeding trough and the feeding roller before the fibre material or the web of lap leaves the nip gap between the feed roller and the feeding trough.<br>
For the detachment process of the fibre tuft the section between this deflection point or the last nip and the nip line between the following detaching rollers forms the "detaching distance". For an optimum drafting process during the detaching process this detaching<br><br>
distance should be only insignificantly larger than the longest fibre of the staple of fibre material to be processed. In order to achieve an optimum result (economically and in relation to the quality) in the combing process, the machine operator Is obliged to suitably adapt the machine settings according to the material feed. This also includes the optimal adjustment of the detaching distance. With the adjustment of the feeding trough shown in EP-816 540 the first deflection or the first nip can be varied in relation to the distance to the nip line of the following detaching roller. However, the scope for adjustment is severely restricted by the fixed position of the feed roller. In addition, with this type of adjustment the geometrical relationships of the feeding trough to the feeding roller vary whereby the nip relationships to the web of lap also vary. Also no clearly defined nips are present between the feeding trough and the feed roller.<br>
It is thus the object of the invention to propose a device which can make a simple adaptation of the detaching distance without the position of the feeding trough to the feed roller changing.<br>
This object is solved by the feeding trough occupying a fixed position in relation to the nipper frame and at least one means defining the nip, whose position can be varied, being provided between the feed roller and the feeding trough. It is thereby possible to achieve a simple adaptation of the detaching distance without varying the geometrical transport relationships for the web of lap. In addition, a clearly defined nip can be set between the feeding trough and the feed roller. If it is necessary to adjust the setting distance with reference to the fibre material to be processed or the desired combing out, this can be compensated with the adjustment of the additional means in the feeding trough in order to again achieve optimal relationships (detaching distance) for the detaching process.<br>
It is preferably proposed that the means are embodied as a guide element which extends inside the feeding trough over the width of the feeding trough and which with the feed roller defines at least one nip for the fibre material. In this case it is provided that, seen in the direction of transport of the fibre material, the front end of the guide element forms the nip for the fibre material. This can be achieved by the arc-shaped<br><br>
face of the guide element, which is located opposite to the feed roller, having a smaller radius than the radius of the feed roller.<br>
For fixing the guide elements inside the feeding trough it is proposed that the cushion plate is provided with receptacles in the area of the feeding trough which are embodied to receive means attached to the respective guide element to fix the guide element in its built-in position.<br>
At the same time, seen over the width (B) of the feeding trough, at least one row of receptacles can be provided. Simple assembly is thereby achieved since the guide elements merely need to be inserted into the corresponding receptacles.<br>
However, it is also possible, as further proposed, to fix the guide elements so that they can be continuously adjusted in their position, in this case, it would be advantageous to provide markings at the individual adjusting devices so that the adjustment can be made exactly the same at all comb heads.<br>
In order to be able to make a further adaptation inside the gap between feeding trough and feed roller, it is proposed that at least one further adjustable guide element is provided in the feeding trough which with the feed roller forms at least one additional nip. A second nip can thus be defined in the area of the feed roller.<br>
Further advantages of the invention are explained and described in detail with reference to the following exemplary embodiments.<br>
In the figures:<br>
Fig. 1	is a schematic side view of a known nipper unit<br>
Fig. 2	is an enlarged partial view from Fig. 1 with the guide elements claimed<br>
according to the invention<br>
Fig. 3	is a view of the section A-A from Fig. 2<br><br>
Fig. 4	is a further exemplary embodiment from Fig. 2 with a plurality of guide<br>
elements<br>
Fig. 5	shows a possibility for continuous adjustment of the guide elements from<br>
Fig. 2.<br>
Figure 1 shows a nipper unit 1 which is swivellably mounted by means of the crank arms 2, 3. In this case, two crank arms 2 are each swivellably mounted at the side of a circular comb 4, which is shown schematically, on its circular comb shaft 5. The other end of the swivel arms 2 is fixed rotationally movably on the nipper frame 8. The rear swivel arm (two can also be provided) is mounted rotationally fixedly on a nipper shaft 10. The opposite free end of the swivel arm 3 is connected rotationally movably to the nipper frame 8 by means of the shaft 9.<br>
The nipper unit 1 substantially consists of a lower cushion plate 12 fixedly connected to the nipper frame 8 and an upper cushion plate 14 (in some cases also called nipper blade) which is affixed to two swivel arms 15, 15'. These swivel arms are attached to the nipper frame 8 so that they can be swivelled about a swivel axis 16. The swivel arms 15,15' are connected to respectively one spring strut 18 which in turn is mounted on a drive eccentric 21 by means of an axis 20. Seen in the direction of material flow, a pair of detaching rollers 24 is provided behind the nipper unit. A fixed comb which is in communication with the nipper frame 8 is not shown for reasons of better clarity.<br>
In the view according to Fig. 1 the nipper unit 1 is located in a front position in which it is open and the detaching process is carried out with the end of the web of lap W. This end is generally described as fibre tuft FB. In this front-most position (also known as front dead-point position) there is a distance X between the nip PA of the detaching rollers 24 and the last nip P of the feeding trough 26. At the end of the feeding trough this nip P is followed by a first deflection for the web of lap transported between the feed roller 27 and the feeding trough 26 from which it is transported or drawn off in the direction of the nip line PA of the detaching cylinder 24. The distance X is to be equated to the detaching distance during the detachment process. A compressive force is<br><br>
exerted on the web of lap between the feed roller 27 and the feeding trough 26 at least In partial areas of the conveying gap for executing the feed by means of the feed roller 27. The magnitude of the compressive force on the fibre mass is defined by the distance between the feeding trough and the feed roller, i.e. at the point where this distance is smallest, the compressive force acting on the fibre mass is greatest. This point forms the actual nip which defines the detaching distance X.<br>
Figure 2 shows an enlarged partial view of Fig. 1 with the guide means claimed according to the invention which is hereinafter characterised by the term "insert E". As is shown in the sectional view A-A in Fig. 3, this insert E extends over the width B of the feeding trough 26 and lies on its curvature. As a result of the insert E the nip P is shifted to P1, whereby the detaching distance also changes to X1. The curvature of the insert E which is located opposite to the feed roller has a smaller radius R1 than the radius R of the feed roller 27. By suitable attachment inside the feeding trough it is ensured that an exactly defined nip is formed for the web of lap between the insert E and the feed roller at the front end of the insert E.<br>
It may be necessary to increase the detaching distance X1, for example, if a material for combing out must be combed with a large staple (characteristic for fibre length), i.e., by using a displaceable insert E, the detaching distance X can be adapted to different staple lengths without needing to change the setting distance. On the other hand, if the setting distance needs to be adjusted (e.g. to change the noil percentage), it is naturally possible to re-establish optimal relationships for the detaching process by adjusting the insert, e.g., if the setting distance e is increased, the insert E can be adjusted in the direction of the detaching roller to keep the detaching distance X constant.<br>
The insert E is provided with a plurality of pins S distributed at a distance over the width B, which project into receptacles 29 and thus secure the insert E against any displacement in the direction of transport T. If necessary, additional safety mechanisms could also be provided which secure the pins S in the direction of their longitudinal axis<br><br>
to prevent lifting from the feeding trough. Lateral guides for the lap in the area of the feeding trough were not shown for reasons of clarity.<br>
As can be deduced from the diagram in Fig. 2, a plurality of rows of receptacles 29 are arranged one after the other seen in the direction of transport T. It is thereby possible for the insert E to be displaced by simply "changing over", for example, into a position which is shown by the dashed line E1 in the example. The detaching distance is thus increased to X2. A plurality of settings are possible depending on the number of receptacles 29.<br>
Figure 4 shows a further exemplary embodiment where a second insert E2 is inserted in the feeding trough 26 which is used in the area of introduction of the lap W between the feed roller 27 and the feeding trough 26. The position of this insert E2 can also be displaced in the direction of transport T as is indicated by the double arrow. An additional nip KP between the feed roller 27 and the insert E2 can be defined by the position of the insert E2. This further nip KP has an influence on the retention force on the fibres during the detaching process and that during transport of the lap in the feeding process. The front-most nip P1 is defined by the insert E. Both inserts E, E2 have pins S which project into receptacle 29 of the feeding trough 26 and thus ensure that it is fixed in position. As is described in fig. 2, the inserts E and E2 also have a smaller radius of curvature R1 than the radius R of the feed roller 27. An exact nip line Is thus defined.<br>
Figure 5 shows another embodiment where the insert E is fixedly connected on both sides to respectively one arm 31 which are connected at their opposite sides to a disk 33. This disks 33 are swivellably mounted on an axis 32 which is shown schematically. The axis 32 coincides with the central point of the radius r of the feeding trough 26. The disks 33 are each provided with two oblong holes 34 through which screws 35 project. The screws are received in tapped holes not shown in detail of a bearing plate 38 which is shown schematically, and which is connected to the frame 8 and at the same time can also be provided for mounting the feed roller. By loosening the screws 35 on both<br><br>
sides of the receptacle E (only one side is shown), this can be continuously adjusted about the axis 32 inside the feeding trough 26 as is indicated by the double arrow. As soon as the desired position is reached, the screws 35 are tightened whereby the disk 33 is braced against the bearing plate 38 and thus the set position is fixed by the clamping. It is also feasible to provide markings on the disk 33 which provide a possibility for accurate adjustment in cooperation with markings on the bearing plate 38. This embodiment allows a plurality of adjustment possibilities for the nip P1 but is somewhat more expensive. It is also possible to provide an insert E which extends approximately over the entire length of the feeding trough 26 and also ensures adjustment of the nip P1.<br>
It would also be possible to provide inserts for exchange which have different contours on the surface opposite to the fed cylinder 27.<br><br><br>
