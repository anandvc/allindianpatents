				<td>This invention relates to a mechanical load stabilizer with an automatic load dependent stepless gear ratio variation system particularly for application in four or two wheeler automobiles.<br>
Presently most automobiles are fitted with manual shift gears having a  number of fixed gear ratio.<br>
Automatic gear shift has been introduced for four-wheels automobiles extensively as an optional feature and to two wheelers limited to a few models. However, they mostly uses fixed number of gear speed ratios which are changed automatically. There are a few two wheelers having automatic shift which have infinite gear ratios.<br>
There are disadvantages associated with the present system of manual and automatic change of gear system.<br>
One of the main disadvantages associated with the present system of manual or automatic gear shift system is that it is generally limited to 4 or 5 speed only and makes its performance dependent on driver's skill.<br>
Another disadvantage associated with the present system is that the speed dependent gear shifting systems having infinite gear ratios which vary according to vehicle1 s speed. Such systems though have very good pick - up but are not fuel efficient. Such vehicle with very little load and running slowly, would be consuming more fuel unnecessary as it would be running on higher gear ratio being gear dependent. It would also be consuming more fuel when it is rolling down<br><br>
a slope slowly where it hardly needs any power from the engine and should consume a very little quantity of fuel.<br>
Therefore the main object of the present invention is to provide a simple, effective and a versatile automatic load dependent stepless gear ratio variation system.<br>
An object of the present invention is to propose a stepless gear ratio variation system which changes speed, gear ratio automaitically in such a way that the effective load on the driving motor or engine is kept constant at optimum power and torque output.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose a stepless gear ratio variation  system which act as a load stabilizer.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to propose a stepless gear-ratio variation system which is a<br><br>
passive device, has inherent bias to adjust its gear ratio such that the effective load on the driving engine remains stabilized whenever the applied load varies.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to propose a stepless gear-ratio variation system which provides running of a motor or an engine constantly on optimum load and improves fuel efficiency, pick - up and overall performance of the motor or engine and independent of driver's habit.<br><br>
A still further object of the present invention is to propose a stepless gearratio variation system which can be used in all fossil fuel, battery and solar power driven automobiles and is very simple and easy to manufacture.<br>
STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided a mechanical load stabilizer with an automatic load dependent stepless gear ratio variation system for use in automobiles comprising a pair of identical cone pulleys (C1, C2) of cone angle a mounted on rods (R1, R2) in opposite direction to each other, the said rods (R1, R2) are mounted between rigid supports (RS2, Rs2), the said pulleys (C1, C2) are drivingly connected to each other over a belt (B2), the said belt (B2) drivingly passes over a pulley (Pnt) mounted on a rod (Rd), a motor (M) with a pulley (P1) mounted on rigid support (RS2) is drivingly connected to a pulley (Pbt) mounted on the said rod (Rd), the said motor (M) is driving the wheel (W) of the automobile through cone pulley (Cl), a pulley (P4) and belt (B3) characterized in that a pulley-bolt-nut system (Pbnt) mounted on the said rod (Rd), the bolt of the said system (Pbnt) is fixed to the said pulley (Pbt) and the nut of the said system (Pbnt) is fixed to the pulley (Pnt) and a spring (S) mounted on said rod (Rd) between rigid support (RS1) and pulley (Pnt).<br>
The nature of the invention, its objective and further advantages residing in the same will be apparent from the following description made with reference to non-limiting exemplary embodiments of the invention represented in the accompanying drawing.<br>
Fig. 1 - a schematic drawings of the mechanical load stabilizer system;<br><br>
Fig. 2 - a schematic drawing of the detail of the pulley with bolt;<br>
Fig. 3 a schematic drawing of the detail of the pulley with the nut.and<br>
Fig. 4 - a schematic drawing of the detail of the pulley bolt-nut system.<br>
in accordance with the present invention, an entirely new concept in gear ratio variation system is utilized.In this system gear ratio varies automatically in such a way that the effective load on the driving motor or engine is kept constant (  optimum) hence the system act as a load stabilizer.<br>
The system consists of a pair of stepless pulleys transmitting power from the motor to the wheels.<br>
The construction of the system is as shown in the figure 1. In this figure,(M)is the motor or engine. The motor supplies torque to pulley (Pbt)through pulley(Pl)by the belt Bl. Pulley Pbt has bolt(Pbnt) like extension as shown in the figure 2 and pulley Pnt has nut (Pbnt) like extension ( as shown in Fig. 3). When Bolt is inserted into Nut, we<br>
call this assemblage consisting of pulley (Pbt) and Pulley (Pnt) as Pulley-Bolt-Nut (Pbnt) system as shown in Fig. 4.The pulley-bolt- nut (Pbnt) is free to roll about the axel rod (Rd) which passes through it. A spring (S) is placed with pulley (Pnt)<br>
to push the pulley (Pnt) towards  pulley (Pbt). The power is transmitted from motor (M) to wheel (w). via Pulley (P,), belt (Bl), pulley-bolt-nut (Pbnt), cone pulley (Cl), Pulley (P4), belt (B3). Two similar cone gears (C1/C2) conical pulleys of cone angle ^ are mounted on Rods (RI/ R2). These are kept opposite to each other as shown in figure 1. Belt (B2) is put around these two cone gears (C1, C2) and also passes over<br><br>
the pulley (Pnt). From gear (Cl) power from motor is transferred to the wheel via pulley (P4) by the belt (B3).<br>
In a running situation,(w)load is provided on the wheel and position of the  belt (B3) is at radius  R of the cone gear Cl. For simplicity we assume that all pulleys are of equal radius r. In such situation, the effective load on the mnotor is say(w). Now if load on the wheel increases (for example vehicle starts climbing over a slope) it causes an opposing torque which transfers over the path P4-Cl-Pnt and causes a twisting effect between Pulleys (Pnt/Pbt). The twist pushes Pulleys (Pnt / Pbt) apart by the force Fl because of the Bolt-Nut-system. As position of Pulley (PbtO is fixed, the Pulley (Pnt) is pushed against spring (S) shifting the position of the Belt (B2) with it. This shift in the belt changes the gear ratio of the syste. The cone gear (C2) is kept opposite to cone gear (Cl) just to keep the belt tension constant As belt (B3) shifts to a lower radius of the cone gear (Cl) it climbs over the higher radius of cone gear (C2) and belt tension remains constant. Otherwise cone gear (C2) has no role in variation of gear ratio. This shift in belt (B3) occurs until force Fl is balanced by spring force F2=K.x, where(K)is the spring  constant and x is shift in the position of the belt (B3). As the load on the wheel decreases,twisting<br>
effect between Pulleys (Pbt/Pnt)  decreases and spring (S) pushes Pulley (Pnt) and hence belt (B3) to its earlier position,<br>
By appropriately choosing cone angle  of the cone gear (Cl), pitch angle  O of  threads of  Bolt-Nut system and spring constant K of the spring S,one can have the constant stabilized effective load(w) on the motor(M)..<br><br>
It is entirely a new concept, the load dependent gear ratio variation system has promising solutions to have said<br>
drawbacks of all conventional gear ratio variation systems. It is a very simple passive device. It can be implant in a vehicle or a machine alone or together with speed dependent system if such combination is found to be more useful.<br><br><br><br><br>
