PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :<br><br>
The invention relates to a textile-material-processing machine comprising a plurality of combing units to which respectively at least one sliver is supplied for combing out and the fibrous material combed and delivered at the respective combing units is combined to form respectively one sliver and is supplied to a following draw frame with adjacent sliver lay unit by means of a guide.<br>
The combing machines now used in practice generally have eight combing heads arranged adjacent to one another, each supplied with a lap for combing out. The fibre sheet which has been combed out by the individual combing heads and delivered is combined to form a sliver by means of known devices and is supplied to a following drafting arrangement transverse to the direction of material flow of the combing head on a guide table. The sliver formed in the draw frame is then laid in a sliver lay unit by means of a funnel wheel in loop form into a can. Combing machines of this type are now operating with combing circle rates of up to 400 KS/min.<br>
In order to increase the combing circle rates and ultimately also to increase the productivity, CH-PS 681 309 proposes a combing machine where, instead of the known combing heads, so-called combing units are used which are not loaded with a lap sheet from a lap but are supplied with at least one sliver for combing out. This sliver can be supplied to the combing unit from a can located underneath the individual combing units. The combed-out slivers delivered by the individual combing units are combined on a feed table and supplied to a following drafting arrangement. The drafting arrangement can be provided with a control device. With this arrangement it is possible to substantially reduce the combing elements (nippers, circular comb, detaching rollers and so on) whereby substantially higher combing circle rates can be driven as a result of the lower masses to be accelerated.<br>
A lap sheet of about 80 ktex (g/m) is supplied per combing head for combing out to the combing machines used in practice. A sliver formed on a draw frame generally has a mass of 5 ktex. If respectively two slivers are supplied to the combing units proposed in CH'309, in order to achieve the same productivity as conventional combing machines, these must operate at a combing circle rate of 3200 KS/min assuming that eight combing units are also used. Such a high combing circle rate is not feasible from the present-day viewpoint in relation to mechanical loadings and also in relation to the technology of the combing process. It was therefore proposed here to provide a larger number of combing units (e.g ten or twelve) to achieve executable combing circle rates with the aim of enhancing the productivity. In addition, it was also proposed<br>
2<br><br>
that up to four slivers can be supplied to the individual combing units. When 12 such combing units are used, for example, which are each loaded with four slivers of 5 ktex, the same productivity as conventional combing machines would be achieved if the combing units were to be run with combing circle rates of 1070 KS/min. Whether this is technologically feasible with the arrangement shown has been left open. If, as is desired, the productivity is to be further increased, higher combing circle rates must be used.<br>
The material flow direction of the combing units in CH'309 corresponds to the direction of feed of the slivers to the following drafting arrangement via the feed table. This has the result that if it is necessary to increase the number of combing units, a longer feed table is required since the size of the combing units in the example shown, seen in the direction of material flow, is greater than its dimension transverse to the material flow. The double-sided application of the combing units on both sides of the feed table shown in CH'309 additionally results in more difficult accessibility to the combing units especially if the combing machine must be set up anew for processing a new batch of material. That is, manipulation must be carried out on both sides of the feed table for attaching the new slivers.<br>
For driving the combing units in the example of CH'309 individual electric-motor drives are provided for each combing unit, where two adjacent combing units can also be driven by means of common electric motors. This is relatively expensive and requires a corresponding control device to drive the individual motors synchronously with one another. It is thus the object of the invention to eliminate the described disadvantages of the prior art.<br>
This object is solved by proposing that the combing units are affixed in a row adjacent to one another on a supporting frame supported at least at two points on the ground and forming a free space between the combing units and the ground, where the material flow direction of the combing units is aligned transverse to the direction of feed to the drafting arrangement.<br>
With this device it is possible to arrange a plurality of combing units directly adjacent to one another in a row using the alignment of the combing units, on the one hand ensuring good accessibility to the combing units from one side and on the other hand the space requirement in the longitudinal direction of the machine can be kept to a minimum. That is, the individual combing units are arranged directly adjacent to one another without intermediate spaces. Thus, a fairly large number of combing units can be installed without any problem.<br>
3<br><br>
The term "combing units" in the present case can be equated to the term "combing head" in conventional combing machines. It is also possible to talk of a combing box in which the actual combing elements (nippers, circular comb, detaching cylinder and so on) are mounted. In conventional combing machines a "gauge" is also talked about where the gauge corresponds to the width of the respective combing head or the distance between the centre lines of two adjacent combing heads. These centre lines run in the material flow direction of the respective combing head.<br>
It is advantageously further proposed that at least one group of combing units located adjacent to one another in a row is connected to a common drive unit by means of drive elements. It is thereby possible to optimise and adapt the required driving power in conjunction with the required drive shafts according to the number of combing units used. In particular, this prevents too-long drive shafts being used where there is a risk of elastic twist over its length, whereby the synchronisation of the drives is impaired.<br>
In order to deliver the combed-out slivers delivered at the individual combing units without damage and with the wrong draft to the draw frame, it is proposed that the guide consists of at least one revolving conveyor belt running transverse to the material flow direction of the combing units and connected to a drive. This ensures gentle transport of the slivers over fairly large distances.<br>
In order to maintain the shortest distances for supplying the slivers to be processed, it is proposed that containers for supplying the slivers to the combing units are located underneath the combing units in the area of the free space. With this arrangement, a compact allocation of the container to the combing machine is obtained, whereby the space requirement and the accessibility for attaching the slivers is optimised.<br>
It is preferably proposed that the containers are rectangular cans whose width is the same as or smaller than the width (gauge) of the combing units. It is thereby possible to allocate the supply source (container) for the sliver or slivers directly underneath the respective combing unit whereby changing the containers and tracking a full container or can is also simplified. That is, the rectangular can can be changed by displacement in its longitudinal direction without needing to displace adjacent containers. The handling during a can change is thus simplified.<br>
In order to supply a desired quantity of fibrous material (or slivers) to the individual combing units, it is further proposed that located in the free space underneath each combing unit are two<br>
4<br><br>
rectangular cans one behind the other, seen in the material flow direction of the combing units, wherein at least one sliver is laid in each can for supply to the allocated combing unit in loop form. The supply and removal of cans by displacement in their longitudinal direction is herewith ensured.<br>
With reference to the supply of slivers to the combing units, it is proposed that the slivers of the cans provided directly underneath a combing unit and arranged one after the other are supplied to this combing unit. As a further alternative it is proposed that the slivers from two cans located with their longitudinal sides adjacent to one another are supplied to a combing unit. A variant is also possible where the slivers from two cans located with their longitudinal sides adjacent to one another in an offset manner are supplied to a combing unit.<br>
In addition, an embodiment is claimed wherein it is proposed that the containers are round cans whose diameter is the same as or smaller than twice the total width of two adjacent combing units below which at least two cans are arranged. As a further solution for the supply of slivers, it is proposed that respectively three rectangular cans are provided underneath respectively three adjacent combing units where the width of the cans, seen transverse to the material flow direction, is the same as or less than 1.5 times the width of one of the combing units and two cans have their longitudinal sides directly opposed. A simple allocation to the combing units can thus be achieved, ensuring good accessibility.<br>
Furthermore, two rectangular cans can be provided underneath two adjacent combing units, whose width is the same as or less than twice the width of a combing unit and the cans are arranged one behind the other when seen in the material flow direction. In order to fully utilise the storage space for the material feed, a can width of between 1.5 times and a maximum of twice the width of a combing unit will be selected here.<br>
As a further solution, it is proposed that the containers are round or tetragonal cans and respectively three cans are provided underneath respectively three adjacent combing units, whose external dimensions, when viewed transverse to the material flow direction of the combing units, are the same as or less than three times the width of one of the combing units and the cans are arranged successively in a row when seen in the material flow direction of the combing units. The external dimensions will preferably move between 2.5 times and a maximum of three times the width of a combing unit to fully utilise the available site.<br>
5<br><br>
Another embodiment with regard to still-possible good accessibility is feasible where the containers are round or tetragonal cans and respectively four cans are provided underneath respectively four adjacent combing units, whose external dimensions, when viewed transverse to the material flow direction of the combing units, are the same as or less than four times the width of one of the combing units and the cans are arranged successively in a row when seen in the material flow direction of the combing units. Here also, the selected external dimensions of the cans are preferably move between three and four times the width of a combing unit to fully utilise the site.<br>
In the previously proposed can arrangement, it is also possible for more than one sliver to be laid inside a can. That is, more than one sliver can then be withdrawn simultaneously from a can and supplied to the corresponding combing unit. References to cans in which several slivers are laid and are then withdrawn simultaneously can be obtained, for example from DE-PS 817 572 and JP-51-136928.<br>
In order to support the supporting frame on which the adjacent combing units are affixed by means of corresponding fixing means on the ground, it is proposed that the supporting frame is supported with its ends over the frame of a drive unit and the frame of a sliver lay unit on the ground.<br>
If the number of combing units used gives a corresponding length which could result in bending of the supporting frame, it is proposed in this case that further supports are provided for the supporting frame. These further supports can not only serve to support the supporting frame but can also be provided with bearing elements to support the drive shafts running in the longitudinal direction of the combing machine. One or more supports can be provided according to the length of the combing machine.<br>
In order that the drive shafts required are not too long (risk of elastic twisting), it is proposed that at least one drive unit is located within the row of adjacent combing units. Depending on the length of the combing machine or the number of combing units used, it is also possible to provide further drive units where a certain group of adjacently located combing units is allocated to each drive unit for driving. An embodiment is proposed where each drive unit is provided for driving at least one group of adjacent combing units.<br>
6<br><br>
To achieve a high productivity it is proposed that at least sixteen combing units are provided. With a suitably large number of combing units it is possible that in the event of failure of individual combing units, the combing machine need not be shut down. That is, the resulting lack of mass can easily be corrected on subsequent regulated drafting arrangements. In contrast hereto, in a conventional combing machine, the entire machine must be shut down as soon as the material supply at a combing head fails. This results in down times whereby the productivity of the machine decreases and immediate intervention by the operator is required. In accordance with the proposal according to the invention, immediate intervention to eliminate the fault in individual combing units is no longer required and can be planned. Such a combing machine can then possibly be operated like other longitudinal section machines such as an open end machine (rotor machine).<br>
It is furthermore proposed that the combing units are constructed as individual assemblies and coupling elements are provided to connect the assembly to the drive elements of the allocated drive unit. This makes it possible for the combing unit to be dismounted or mounted completely as an assembly. It is thereby possible to exchange a defective combing unit for a new combing unit held in reserve. Longer breaks in production can thereby be avoided. With a corresponding design it is even possible to make the exchange whilst the combing machine is running. The combing machine must possibly only be stopped briefly to couple in the coupling elements again after the exchange has been made. It would also be feasible to construct at least two adjacent combing units as an independent assembly which is exchangeably attached within the group of combing units.<br>
In order to maintain sufficient productivity of the individual combing units operating at high nip numbers, it is proposed that at least two slivers having respectively at least 10 ktex fibre mass are supplied to the individual combing units. It is thereby possible, bearing in mind the desired productivity, to submit only a small number of slivers to the individual combing units. This also gives advantages in the small number of containers which thus need to be provided for storage of the slivers.<br>
It is further proposed that a combing unit has a width (gauge) of 150 to 500 mm. Preferably, one combing unit has a width (gauge) of 150 to 250 mm. As has already been described, the term "gauge" relates to the external dimension (width) of the directly adjacent combing units.<br><br>

Figure 1 is a plan view of a known combing machine 1 with a total of eight combing heads Kl to K8 arranged adjacent to one another, each having a lap W for processing located in front thereof. The individual units (e.g. nippers, circular comb, detaching rollers, lap rollers, delivery rollers<br>
8<br><br>
and so on) of the combing heads Kl to K8 are driven by a drive unit A by means of shafts running longitudinally to the combing heads of which two shafts Wl and W2 are shown schematically. The drive unit substantially consists of a main motor and a transmission. In the case of combing heads it is possible to generally talk of a "gauge" and a plurality of gauges together form the longitudinal section of the combing machine in which the fibre material is combed out.<br>
The slivers B formed at the individual combing heads K1-K8 are guided over a table T to a drafting arrangement S. As can be seen in particular in Fig. 2, the slivers B are guided obliquely upwards by the table T. A guide plate not shown in detail is provided for this purpose in this area. The drafting arrangement S comprising a plurality of drafting rollers SW draws out the supplied fibrous mass and forms a fibre sheet V which is then combined by suitable guide means (not shown) following the drafting arrangement S to form a sliver 3. The sliver 3 is then transferred by means of guide or conveying means 4 shown schematically (e.g. a conveyor belt) to driven calender rollers KW by which means said sliver is delivered to a rotating funnel wheel TR. The funnel wheel TR then lays the received sliver 3 into a can K located underneath the funnel wheel in a loop fashion. At the same time, the can K executes an additional rotary movement.<br>
Figure 2 shows a longitudinal shaft 6 from which the drafting arrangement S and the sliver lay unit BA is driven, as shown schematically. A detailed representation of such a drive can be obtained, for example, from EP-PS 640 704.<br>
Figures 3 and 4 show an exemplary embodiment of the invention. In this case, as in the known embodiment from Fig. 1, a sliver lay unit BA is provided wherein the fibre sheet V formed from a drafting arrangement by means of the drafting rollers SW is combined to form a sliver 3. The sliver 3 is then supplied by a pair of calender rolls KW to a funnel wheel by which means the sliver 3 is laid in loop form in a can K.<br>
In contrast to the combing machine from Fig. 1, in the exemplary embodiment in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, for example, individual combing units XI to X16 directly adjacent to one another and affixed to a supporting frame 8 are provided. The supporting frame 8 is supported in this case by means of the frame 28 of a drive unit A and the frame 29 of a sliver lay unit BA on the ground O.<br>
9<br><br>
The combing units can also be designated as combing boxes where the actual combing elements, such as nippers 10, circular comb 11, detaching cylinder, cleaning brush 13 and so on are mounted by means of suitable elements within the respective combing unit XI to XI6, as can be deduced from the enlarged side view X in Fig. 8. The combing elements have somewhat narrower length dimensions than the width C of the housing 16 of the respective combing unit X1-X16.<br>
The combing units XI-XI6 are attached to the supporting frame 8 by means of fixing means 18 indicated schematically in Fig. 8 so that when mounted, they have a free space FR from the floor O with a clearance FA. Located in this free space FR and underneath the combing units XI-XI6 are, for example, flat cans Fl to Fx from which slivers for combing out are supplied to the respectively allocated combing unit by means of suitable guide means. For this purpose, as can be seen from Fig. 8, pairs of rollers 20, 21 and 22 are attached to the support 8 or the combing unit itself to supply the slivers Zl or 22 to the feed roller 9 of the nippers 10. In the example shown in Fig. 8, two slivers Zl, Z2 having a fibre mass of 10 ktex, for example, are withdrawn from the cans Fl and F2 and supplied to the combing unit XI. Depending on the design of the combing unit and the number of adjacent combing units in conjunction with the mass of the sliver, it is also possible to have a design where only one sliver or more than two slivers are supplied to the respective combing unit.<br>
Indicated schematically in the diagram in Fig. 8 underneath the cleaning brush 13 is a channel 17 via which the combed-out components (e.g the short fibres also known as noil) are sucked out to a central removal device which is not shown. In this case, the channel is at negative pressure and has corresponding openings (not shown) to receive and remove the components which are separated downwards. It is also possible to have an embodiment where the frame 8 is provided with corresponding openings and serves as a channel for the removal of the separated components.<br>
The actual combing process within the respective combing unit is generally known and is thus not described here in detail. In addition, it is described in detail, for example, in the publication "The Textile Institute - a Practical Guide to Combing and Drawing -ISBN 0 900739 93 2 of 1987". However, the invention is not restricted to the embodiment of the combing device shown but other embodiments of combing elements<br>
10<br><br>
and subsequent sliver-forming elements are also possible. For example, a combing device is also feasible where the fibre material taken off from the detaching cylinders is delivered to a following continuously operating device for sliver formation.<br>
The material flow direction MF inside the respective combing unit X1-X16 is aligned transverse to the direction of supply D of the combing machine slivers B ("slivers" for short) formed to the following draw frame S. The slivers B formed on the individual combing units XI to X16 are laid by means of a guide plate 31, a sliver funnel not shown in detail and a pair of rollers 32 onto a driven conveyor belt FB by which means they are transferred to the drafting rollers SW of the following drafting arrangement S. Known deflecting elements, such as those disclosed, for example, in EP-PS 349 866 can be used for deflecting the slivers B into the conveying direction D.<br>
The conveyor belt FB is connected to the transmission of the drive unit A by means of a drive connection 26 shown schematically and is driven therefrom. The conveyor belt FB is rotatably mounted by means of known elements not shown at one end on the frame 28 of the drive unit A and at the other end on the frame 29 of the sliver lay unit BA, Additional supports 24 for the conveyor belt FB can be provided between these two bearing points as was indicated in Fig. 8.<br>
The individual combing units XI to X16 are driven by means of drive elements, e.g. longitudinal shafts Wx. For reasons of clarity only one shaft Wx is shown. In practice, a plurality of longitudinal shafts can be used for driving the previously described combing elements.<br>
Instead of flat cans Fl to Fx, round cans R can naturally also be used for supplying the slivers Zl to Zx, as indicated in Fig. 3. In this case, a round can arranged below the combing units, for example, has a diameter which is equal to or somewhat less than twice the width C of a combing unit.<br>
Figure 9 shows an enlarged partial view of the combing units XI to X4 from Fig. 3. In this case, the combing units XI to X3 shown have a gauge or a width C. For reasons of clarity, the respective nippers 10 which are driven by means of the nipper shaft 14 were shown as boxes. The nippers 10 are connected by means of a lever mechanism 19 to the shaft   14   by   which   means  the  to-and-fro   movement   of the   nippers   is   produced.<br>
11<br><br>
Additionally shown schematically are the circular comb shaft 15 and a drive shaft 23 for driving the detaching cylinder. Other longitudinal shafts for driving the remaining elements are naturally also present but these are not shown here.<br>
The individual housing 16 of the combing units are interconnected by means of fixing elements 34 (e.g. screws) and fixed on the support 8 by means of other fixing elements 18 shown schematically. Couplings P shown schematically in Fig. 9 are provided for interconnecting the individual shaft sections of the drive shafts 14, 15 and 23. Provided in the area of the couplings P are bearing points LS for mounting the individual shafts. For reasons of clarity these bearing points LS are only shown at the shaft 23. These bearing points are also provided at the remaining drive shafts 14, 15.<br>
By means of this special design of the fixing in conjunction with the couplings P provided, it is possible to release individual combing units from a row of combing units and replace these. This case would arise if one of the combing units is defective and needs to be replaced as quickly as possible to maintain the productivity. With the arrangement shown, as a result of the couplings provided the entire combing machine 1 must be stopped when exchanging a combing unit. It would possibly also be feasible to have a correspondingly designed unit of a combing unit where the coupling elements and the shafts are constructed such that an exchange can take place during operation.<br>
Figure 10 shows an enlarged partial view according to Fig. 3 where a possible allocation of the flat cans Fl to F4 to the individual combing units is shown. In this case, the slivers Zl and Z3 of the cans Fl and F3 located with their longitudinal sides directly adjacent to one another are supplied to the combing unit XI by means of guide elements 20 to 22 shown schematically in Fig. 8. The combing unit X2 receives its slivers Z2 and Z4 from the cans F2 and F3.<br>
Figure 11 shows another possibility for supplying the slivers. In this case, respectively two slivers ZI and Z4 are supplied to the combing unit XI from the cans Fl and F4 where the cans Fl and F4 are arranged with their longitudinal sides offset with respect to one another. Numerous possibilities for supplying the slivers are feasible, these being dependent on the accessibility to the machine and the logistics of the supply and removal of the cans. As has already been described, round cans can also be used and a<br>
12<br><br>
larger number of cans. This depends on the overall concept of the combing machine or on the design of the individual combing units.<br>
Figure 12 shows another possibility for supplying the slivers. In this case, respectively two slivers Zl and Z2 are supplied from the cans Fl and F2 to the combing unit XI by means of guides not shown where the cans Fl and F2 are arranged successively underneath the combing unit XI, seen in the longitudinal direction.<br>
Figures 13 and 14 show further embodiments as to how flat cans can be allocated to the corresponding combing units for supplying slivers, ensuring good accessibility to the combing units. For reasons of clarity only part of the existing combing units is shown. According to Fig. 13, three flat cans Fl to F3 are provided under three adjacent combing units XI to X3 where respectively one sliver Zl to Z3 is supplied from each flat can Fl to F3 to one of the combing units XI to X3. Two of the flat cans Fl and F3 are located adjacent to one another, the width fa of one flat can being the same as or less than 1.5 times the width C of a combing unit. The third flat can F2 which supplies the combing unit X2 with a sliver Z2 is located in a row to the can F3, when seen in the material flow direction of the combing units. That is, two of the narrow sides of the flat cans F2 and F3 are opposite to one another. It is also feasible to arrange the can F2 centrally to the cans Fl and F3.<br>
Figure 14 shows an arrangement where each combing unit XI and X2 is allocated respectively one flat can Fl an F2 for supplying the slivers Zl and Z2. In this case, the cans Fl and F2 are arranged one after the other in a row, when seen in the material flow direction of the combing units, and below the combing units. The width fb of one flat can Fl or F2 approximately corresponds to twice the width C (gauge) of a combing unit. This allocation also ensures good accessibility to the combing units and simple can exchange.<br>
In the further exemplary embodiments in Figs. 15 and 16, the allocation of round cans and tetragonal cans (can also be flat cans) to the corresponding combing units is shown. Provided in Fig. 15 are respectively three round cans Rl to R3 or tetragonal cans (e.g'. flat cans) Fl to F3 arranged in a row, whose slivers Zl, Z2 and Z3 are supplied to the combing units XI, X2 and X3. The round cans Rl to R3 or tetragonal cans Fl to F3<br>
13<br><br>
located underneath three adjacent combing units XI to X3 have an external dimension ra which is equal to or less than three times the width C of a combing unit.<br>
In the example in Fig. 16 four round cans Rl to R4 arranged one after the other in a row or tetragonal cans Fl to F4 indicated by dashed lines are provided from which respectively one sliver Zl, Z2, Z3 and Z4 is supplied to four combing units XI to X4 located there above. The combing units XI to X4 show are only some of the combing units actually provided. In this embodiment the round cans Rl to R4 or the tetragonal cans Fl to F4 have an external dimension rb which corresponds to approximately four times the width C of the combing units.<br>
The examples shown with the round cans and tetragonal cans (or flat cans) also ensure good accessibility to the combing units and provide good facilities for changing with reserve cans held in readiness. The degree of filling of the cans shown can be selected so that the can located at the end of the row is always the first to be empty. It is naturally also possible to provide a complete block change of a row of cans Rl to R3 (R4) or Fl to F3 (F4) to install new filled reserve cans. As has already been described more than one sliver can be laid inside a can for supply to the allocated combing unit.<br>
The other Figures 5 to 7 show various examples of drive concepts in conjunction with additional supports on the ground O. Figure 5 shows an embodiment where the number of sixteen combing units XI to X16 arranged in a row and shown as an example is driven by two drive units Al and A2. The drive unit Al located inside the row of combing units XI to X16 drives the group FG1 of combing units XI to X8. The drive connection is indicated by means of a drive shaft W3 shown schematically. The drive unit Al has a gear unit HI shown schematically which is driven by at least one motor Ml. The other group G2 of combing units X9 to X16 is driven by the drive unit A2 which likewise has a gear unit H2 driven by a motor M2. The drive connection from gear unit H2 to the individual combing units X9 to X16 is shown schematically by the shaft W4. As a result of the proposed division of the drive into two groups Gl, G2, the individual drive shafts W3, W4 can be kept relatively short. With this concept it is also possible to provide an even larger number than sixteen (e.g. 24 combing units) combing units without overloading a drive and its drive shafts. Such an arrangement is shown, for example, in the further Fig. 7 where the first drive unit Al and the second drive unit A2 each drive twelve combing units XI to X12 and X13 to X24. The supporting frame<br>
14<br><br>
8 is supported in this case by means of the sliver lay unit BA and via the drive units Al and A2 on the ground O. Additionally provided between the sliver layer unit BA and the drive unit Al and between the drive unit Al and the drive unit A2 are supports 37 or 38 which additionally support the supporting frame 8 on the ground O. It is thereby possible to provide a large number of adjacently operating combing units without the supporting frame bending in the central area. The combing units XI to X24 are attached as shown in Fig. 4.<br>
Figure 6 shows a further exemplary embodiment where the combing units XI to XI6 are also divided into two groups Gl and G2. The drive unit A3 disposed between the groups Gl and G2 is provided with a common drive motor M3 which drives two gear stages HI and H2. The first group Gl is driven via the drive unit A3 by the gear stage HI by means of the drive connection W5. The other gear stage H2 drives the group G2 of combing units X9 to X16 by means of the drive connection W6. An additional support 36 is provided to support the outer end of this group G2 or its supporting frame 8 on the ground O.<br>
The number of combing units used depends on the fibre mass processed and delivered at the individual combing units in conjunction with the total fibre mass which can be processed by the following draw frame. Two subsequent draw frame units can possibly be provided to process fibrous material delivered from the individual combing units in fractions and lay it in a separate can by means of respectively one laying device. Many other embodiments which can be carried out within the scope of the invention are also possible.<br>
