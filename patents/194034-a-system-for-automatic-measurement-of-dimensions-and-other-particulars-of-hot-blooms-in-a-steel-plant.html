				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a system for automatic measurement of dimensions and other particulars of hot steel blooms in a steel plant.<br>
The invention relates more particularly to an integrated system comprising a number of CCD cameras installed at various selected positions in a blooming mill and a photo sensor located adjacent to a 1000 Ton Shear for cutting the crop ends as well as the bloom into cut-pieces when required, the electrical outputs of the cameras and photo sensor corresponding to the instantaneous width, height, length of blooms, and length of front and rear crop ends of blooms are supplied to an industrial grade personal computer provided with a suitably programmed software for computing and displaying the dimensional and other processing parameters of the blooms at the operator's pulpits.<br>
In the existing system, the dimensions of hot steel blooms are 'measured manually after stopping the movement of the blooms on the roll table of a blooming mill, using the conventional steel calipers and scales. The drawbacks of the existing system are; (i) it is time-consuming and not sufficiently accurate, (ii) it is inconvenient for the operating personnel to take measurements on hot blooms; and (iii) it can not provide additional processing data such as optimum volume and weight of bloom after cropping, weight of crops cut and weight of ingot rolled, and percentage of yield obtained at 1000 Ton Shear. The object of the invention is to provide an automatic system for determining the dimensional and other production<br>
- 2 -<br><br>
parameters required for blooming mills, billet mills as well as rail and structural mills with adequate accuracy, and<br>
instanteneously, under moving condition of hot blooms on the roll tables in blooming mills.<br>
The other object is to increase the productivity of blooming as well as of billet mills and to reduce wastage of materials in said mills by way of cutting over-sized crop ends and over-weight or wider weight cut-pieces of blooms transferred to rail and structural mills.<br>
The invention is described fully and particularly in an unrestricted manner with reference to the accompanying drawings in which<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic view of the invented system; and<br>
Figure 2 is a longitudinal section of the water cooling Jacket for the CCD cameras used in the invented system.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, five CCD cameras C1, C2, C3, C4 and C5 and one photo sensor PS are installed at different distances and locations with respect to a hot bloom in a blooming mill in which hot bloom B is moving from left to right on a roll table R, camera C1 being used for measuring the width, camera C2 for the height, camera C3 in association with photo sensor TS for the total length including the lengths of front and rear crop ends as well as total length without front crop ends,camera C4 for the cut-Diece length of bloom for rail and structural mills and camera C5 for the total length of bloom for billet mill after cutting off the crop ends. The values of bloom<br>
- 3 -<br><br>
width and height are exhibited in display units D1 and D2. The values of total length (i.e. including lengths of front and rear crops), desired crop lengths to be cut, actual crop lengths cut, desired cut-piece lengths, actual cut-piece lengths, total bloom lengths, yield for the individual blooms, total crop lengths cut are exhibited in display unit D2.<br>
The CCD camera is a precision electro-optical instrument<br>
which is housed in a compact, light weight and rugged enclosure<br>
and contains a line-scan image sensor in the form of an array of<br>
Dhoto diodes which converts the infra red radiations emitted from<br>
the hot bloom into discrete charge packets. Each camera is<br>
optionally fitted with a viewer for aligning the array of photo<br>
diodes with the bloom dimension measured. The charge packets<br>
after a given exposure time are transferred into two high-speed<br>
CCD shift registers for transport to the camera output. The<br>
outputs of	all the five cameras are read into the memory of<br>
an industrial type personal computer PC/AT provided with a software programmed in C language for the logic defined to meet the requirements of blooming, billet,rail and structural mills.<br>
The CCD camera is operable at an outside temperature of 0-55 C. Since the temperature in the neighbourhood of a hot bloom is around 100°C, a water cooling jacket (Fig. 2) is provided for each camera to reduce the temperature outside the camera to be below 40°C.<br>
Referring to Fig. 2, the water cooling jacket WCJ comprises of three stainless steel co-axial shells, 1, 2 and 3, front flange 4 and rear flange 5. Camera C is mounted on<br>
-4-<br><br>
platform P inside the innermost shell 3. Cooling water is circulated in the annular space between the innermost shell 3 and intermediate shell 2 through inlet nozzles 6, 7 and 8, each of preferred diameter 12.5 mm, and outlet nozzles 9 and 10, each of preferred diameter 6.3 mm. The annular space between intermediate shell 2 and outermost shell 1 is filled with heat insulating materials such as glass wool. The front flange 4 holds a toughened glass plate 11 and blue filter glass 12 to<br>
provide the entry for infrared rays emitted from the hot bloom<br>
into the camera C. Three air nozzles (not shown) are circumferentially equi-spaced, and directed onto the toughened glass plate 11 for blowing off the dust particles deposited thereon. The rear flange 5 is provided with the platform P for mounting the camera C thereon and holes for the entry of cables for the power supply, output signal and control signal. Cameras C1, C2 and C4 are mounted respectively at a distance of 3.5m, 3.0m and 6.0m from the hot bloom,and cameras C3 and C5 are each positioned at a distance of 12.0m from the hot bloom. Cameras C3 and C4 are each provided with a pan and tilt' mechanism to allow movements thereof along the horizontal and vertical directions. Photo sensor PS is mounted at a required height and angle with respect to the hot bloom in e small housing for the purpose of tracking the front and<br>
of a hot bloom before it approaches 1000 Ton Shear.<br>
As the front end of a hot bloom oasses the 1000T Ton<br>
shear 3, the system displays the width and height of the bloom by means of cameras C1 and C2 respectively, and the total length<br>
-5-<br><br>
of the bloom (including the front and rear crops thereof) as well as total length without the front crop ends by means of camera C3 and photo sensor PS. Computer calculates the desired piece length to be cut for rail and structural mill, based on the height and width measured by cameras C1 and C2 and based on bloom volume required by rail and structural mills, and displays the computed data on the display unit D2. This desired cut-piece length of the bloom measured by means of camera C4, is exhibited on the display unit D2 for the operator to cut and ensure desired bloom volume for rail and structural mill .<br>
If the bloom without the crop ends is not required to be cut into pieces, the total output length of the bloom, measured by means camera C5, is exhibited on display unit D2.<br>
The results of field trials conducted on the invented system have shown that the yield at 1000 Ton Shear of blooming mill increases by 0.3 to 0.5% and reduction of short length generation at rail and structural mills, to 1% from existing level, thereby making the system cost-effective.<br>
