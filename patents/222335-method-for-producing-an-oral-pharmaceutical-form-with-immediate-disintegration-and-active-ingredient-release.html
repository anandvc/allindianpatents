Method for producing an oral pharmaceutical form with immediate disintegration and active ingredient release<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The invention relates to a method for producing an oral pharmaceutical form with immediate disintegration and active ingredient release even in the mouth. The invention further relates to an active ingredient-containing powder and to the use thereof.<br>
Prior art<br>
EP-A 0 417 588 describes a method for producing a complexed medicament composed of an ionic active ingredient by reacting the active ingredient with a complementarily ionic, particulate polymer in the presence of an amount of water sufficient to moisten the mixture. In the case of active ingredient salts it is necessary to add an acid or base to a mixture to neutralize the counter-ion of the active ingredient. For example, sodium carbonate is added to the mixture in the reaction of active ingredient salts such as propranolol HC1, verapamil HC1 or metoclopamide HC1 with anionic, (meth)acrylate copolymers such as Eudragit® L or Eudragit® L100-55. Taste-masking of the bitter-tasting active ingredients can be achieved in this case. It is additionally mentioned that where the ionic active ingredient is an acid it is possible to employ a particulate polymer which has lateral amino groups as complementarily ionic groups. The lateral amino groups may be for example a tertiary amino group derived from polymerized monomers such as, for example, 2-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate.<br>
WO 01/39751 describes a method for producing molded articles by injection molding with the method steps<br><br>
a)	melting of a (meth)acrylate copolymer which is<br>
composed of 30 to 80% by weight free-radical<br>
polymerized CI to C4 alkyl esters of acrylic or<br>
methacrylic acid and 70 to 20% by weight (meth)acrylate<br>
monomers with a tertiary ammonium or amino group in the<br>
alkyl radical,<br>
where the (meth) acrylate copolymer is mixed with 1 to 7 0% by weight of a plasticizer and of dryer in the ratio of 1:1 to 1:20,<br>
where at least 1% by weight plasticizer is present,<br>
and 0.05 to 5% by weight of a release agent are present,<br>
additionally further usual additives or excipients and, where appropriate, an active pharmaceutical ingredient may be present in the mixture, and the mixture has before the melting a content of low-boiling ingredients with a vapor pressure of at least 1.9 bar at 120°C of more than 0.5% by weight<br>
b)	degassing the mixture in the plastic state at temperatures of at least 120°C, thus reducing the content of low-boiling ingredients with a vapor pressure of at least 1.9 bar at 120°C to a maximum of 0.5% by weight,<br>
c)	injecting the molten and degassed mixture into the mold cavity of an injection mold, the mold cavity having a temperature which is at least 10°C below the glass transition temperature of the (meth)acrylate copolymer, cooling the melt mixture and removing the resulting molded article from the mold.<br>
WO 02/67906 describes a method for producing a coating and binding agent for oral or dermal pharmaceutical forms  consisting  essentially  of  (a)  a  copolymer<br><br>
consisting of free-radical polymerized CI to C4 esters of   acrylic   or   methacrylic   acid   and   further<br>
(meth)aerylate monomers which have functional tertiary ammonium groups, where the copolymer is in powder form with an average particle size of 1-40 yuri, (b) 3 to 15% by weight, based on (a), of an emulsifier having an HLB of at least 14 and (c) 5 to 50% by weight, based on<br>
(a) , of a C12 to Cie monocarboxylic acid or of a Ci2 to Cis hydroxy1 compound, where components (a), (b) and (c) are blended or mixed together with or without addition of water and, where appropriate, with addition of an active pharmaceutical ingredient and further conventional additives, and the coating and binding agent is produced from the mixture by melting, casting, spreading, spraying or granulating.<br>
It is possible according to WO 02/67 906 to obtain pharmaceutical forms which are particularly stable on storage and may comprise in particular moisture-sensitive active ingredients such as acetylsalicylic acid, carbenoxolone, cefalotin, epinefrine, imipramine, potassium iodide, ketoprofen, levodopa, nitrazepam, nitroprusside, oxitetracycline HC1, promethazine, omeprazole or other benzimidazole derivatives or streptomycin.<br>
Classes of active ingredients and substances which may often cause a bitter taste and can advantageously be formulated with masking of the taste using the coating and binding agent disclosed in WO 02/67 906 are, for example:<br>
analgesics and antirheumatics: paracetamol, diclofenac, aceclofenac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, flubiprofen, levacetylmethadol, oxycodone<br>
psychoactive drugs: prometazines, donepezil, modafinil, nefazodone, reboxetine, sertindole, sertraline antibiotics:        erythromicyn,        roxithromycin, clarithromycin,      grepafloxacin,      ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, sparfloxacin, trovafloxacin, nevirapine<br><br>
beta-blockers:   propanoiol,   metoproioi,   Disoproioi,<br>
nebivolol<br>
antidiabetics: metformin, miglitol, repaglinide<br>
HI   antihistamines:   diphenhydramine,   fexofenadine,<br>
mizolastine<br>
H2 antihistamines: cimetidine, nizatidine, ticlopidine,<br>
cetridine, ranitidine,<br>
Vitamins: thiamine nitrates;<br>
and  further  active  ingredients:  quinidine  sulfate,<br>
amiloprilose  HC1,  pseudoephedrine  HC1,  sildenafil,<br>
topiramate, granisetron, rebamipide, quinine HC1<br>
Problem and solution<br>
One problem with many oral pharmaceutical forms is that liquid, e.g. a mouthful of water, is often necessary to assist swallowing. This is unfavorable if, in case of need, no beverage is available or, for example, the current occupational activity must be interrupted in order to be able to take the medicament. Moreover, for many patients it is unpleasant to take their medicament in the presence of other people as it were under observation and attracting attention, this being all the more noticeable if it is necessary to use after a beverage or even ask for one for this purpose.<br>
Many patients, particular mention being made of elderly people and children, therefore desire oral pharmaceutical forms which can be taken simply and unobtrusively virtually anywhere. This is particularly the case with diseases which should or must be taken at a particular time or without delay when required, such as, for example, with analgesics.<br>
There is additionally a need for pharmaceutical forms which on oral intake release the active ingredient present, e.g. analgesic, even in the mouth and, in this way, can have a rapid effect. Known administration forms are, for example, compressed tablets or suckable<br><br>
tablets, freeze-dried tablets, cast tablets or pastilles, sachets, chewable tablets, powders for reconstitution and/or liquid-filled lozenges.<br>
Many of the rapidly disintegrating pharmaceutical forms have the disadvantage, however, that they cause a sandy taste in the mouth which may persist for some minutes until the tablet ingredients have completely dissolved. The sandy taste in the mouth is felt to be unpleasant and may cause an urge to cough. A further problem in this connection is masking the taste of active ingredients with a bitter taste. The known taste-masking coatings cannot be used because of the requirement for release of active ingredient in the mouth.<br>
The intention was to solve these problems by providing a pharmaceutical form which can be taken without liquid and releases the active ingredient immediately. It is moreover intended that there be no sandy taste in the mouth. The pharmaceutical form is to be suitable for a large number of active ingredients, but especially for analgesics of the antirheumatic class or for antibiotics.<br>
The problem is solved by a<br>
method for producing an oral pharmaceutical form with immediate disintegration and active ingredient release even in the mouth, by vigorously mixing<br>
(a)	an anionic active pharmaceutical ingredient with<br>
(b)	a copolymer consisting of free-radical polymerized Cx to C4 esters of acrylic or methacrylic acid and further (meth)acrylate monomers which have functional tertiary amino groups, and<br>
(c)	5 to 50% by weight, based on (b) , of a Ci2 to C22 carboxylic acid<br><br>
in the melt, solidifying the mixture and grinding to an active ingredient-containing powder with an average particle size of 200 ym or less, incorporating the powder into a water-soluble matrix of pharmaceutically customary excipients, with the proviso that not more than 3% by weight, based on the copolymer, of emulsifiers having an HLB of at least 14 may be present.<br>
In a manner which is not yet understood, the advantages of the invention are, unlike the case of WO 02/67906, evident only with anionic active ingredients. It is possible that there is a thermally induced interaction of the claimed ingredients (a) , (b) and (c) which is not inferable in this way from WO 02/67906. The pharmaceutical forms obtainable according to the invention can easily be taken without additional liquid and do not cause a sandy taste after active ingredient release in the mouth.<br>
Implementation of the invention<br>
The invention relates to a method for producing an oral pharmaceutical form with immediate disintegration and active ingredient release even in the mouth, by vigorously mixing<br>
(a)	an anionic active pharmaceutical ingredient with<br>
(b)	a copolymer consisting of free-radical polymerized Ci to C4 esters of acrylic or methacrylic acid and further (meth)aerylate monomers which have functional tertiary amino groups, and<br>

Active pharmaceutical ingredient (a)<br>
The anionic active pharmaceutical ingredient is, owing to the production in the melt, present incorporated in the copolymer in the form of a solid solution. The solid solution state can be detected for example under a polarizing microscope, by thermal analysis (differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)) or in the X-ray diffraction spectrum.<br>

Copolymer (b)<br>
The copolymers (a) consist essentially or entirely of free-radical polymerized CI to C4 esters of acrylic or methacrylic acid and further (meth)acrylate monomers which have functional tertiary amino groups.<br>
Suitable monomers having functional tertiary amino groups are listed in US 4 705 695, column 3, line 64 to column 4, line 13. Particular mention may be made of dimethylaminoethyl acrylate, 2-dimethylaminopropyl acrylate, dimethylaminopropyl methacrylate, dimethyl-aminobenzyl acrylate, dimethylaminobenzyl methacrylate,<br>
(3-dimethylamino-2,2-dimethyl)propyl	acrylate,<br>
dimethylamino-2,2-dimethyl)propyl	methacrylate,<br>
(3-diethylamino-2,2-dimethyl)propyl acrylate and<br>
diethylamino-2,2-dimethyl)propyl	methacrylate,<br>
Dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate is particularly preferred.<br>
The content of monomers with tertiary amino group in the copolymer can advantageously be between 30 and 70% by weight, preferably between 40 and 60% by weight. The proportions of CI to C4 esters of acrylic or methacrylic acid is 70-30% by weight. Mention should be made of methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, butyl methacrylate, methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, butyl acrylate.<br>
A (meth)acrylate copolymer with tertiary amino groups corresponding to component (b) may be composed for example of 20-30% by weight methyl methacrylate, 20-30% by weight butyl methacrylate and 60-40% by weight dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate. The proportion of component (a) in the formulation is preferably 50-90% by weight.<br>
Copolymers (b) are obtained in a manner known per se by free-radical   bulk,   solution,   bead   or   emulsion<br><br>
polymerization. They must be brought before processing to the suitable particle size range by suitable grinding, drying or spraying processes. Granules and powders are suitable. Suitable commercial products are, for example, Eudragit® E 100 (granules) or Eudragit® E PO (powder).<br>
Component (c)<br>
Component (c) : 5 to 50, preferably 10 to 20, % by weight (based on the copolymer component (b) of a Ci2 to C22 carboxylic acid. Component (c) is important for the processability. Unbranched C12 to C22 monocarboxylic acids are preferred. Branched derivatives of said substances may also be suitable where appropriate.<br>
C12 to C22 monocarboxylic acids are, for example, in particular lauric acid and myristic acid. Palmitic acid and stearic acid are preferred.<br>
Emulsifiers having an HLB of at least 14<br>
Emulsifiers having an HLB of at least 14 should be present to the extent of less than 3% by weight, preferably less than 2 or 1% by weight; in particular, no such emulsifier should be present. The reason for this is the powder structure of the starting material in which the intrinsic taste of such emulsifiers is particularly evident. Surprisingly, in contrast to the teaching of WO 02/67 906, it is possible to dispense with the use of emulsifiers on application of the specific method of the invention.<br>
Emulsifiers or surfactants are surface-active substances with lyobipolar character, i.e. nonpolar, lipophilic and polar, hydrophilic centers must be present in their molecule (P.H. List, Azneiformenlehre, Wissenschaftliche Verlagsgesellschaft mbH Stuttgart, 1982,  chapter  6.2.).  Depending  on  the  molecular<br><br>
structure, a distinction is made between ionic and nonionic emulsifiers.<br>
The HLB is a measure, introduced by Griffin in 1950, of the hydrophilicity or lipophilicity of nonionic surfactants. It can be determined experimentally by the phenol titration method of Marszall; cf. vx Par f timer ie, Kosmetik", volume 60, 1979, pp. 444-448; further references in Rompp, Chemie-Lexikon, 8th edition, 1983, p. 1750. See also, for example, US 4 795 643 (Seth)).<br>
An HLB (hydrophilie/lipophilic balance) can be determined exactly only for nonionic emulsifiers. With anionic emulsifiers it is possible to determine this value by calculation, but it is virtually always above or far above 14.<br>
Emulsifiers having an HLB above 14 are understood to be hydrophilic, nonionic emulsifiers with HLB range of at least 14, and likewise hydrophilic, anionic emulsifiers and salts thereof which have a calculated HLB above 14. Examples of emulsifiers having an HLB above 14 are, for example, sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium cetylstearyl sulfate, sucrose stearate and polysorbate 80.<br>
Emulsifiers having HLB values of less than 14, such as, for example, glycerol monos tear ate, may on the other hand also be present in amounts of more than 3% by weight.<br>
Excipients customary in pharmacy<br>
The powder is incorporated into a water-soluble matrix of excipients customary in pharmacy.<br>
Fillers and binding agents<br>
The water-soluble matrix is predominantly formed of fillers and binding agents. These are preferably, for<br><br>
example, water-soluble mono-, di, oligo- or polysaccharides or derivatives thereof, also peptides, proteins etc. Examples are, for example, lactose, fructose, glucose, dextrose, galactose, mannitol, rhamnose, tragacanth, dextrin, guar gum, sorbitol, xylitol, isomatose, sucrose, maltose, hydroxypropyl-methylcellulose (HPMC), starch hydrolyzates, gelatin.<br>
The amounts employed and the use of the customary additives in pharmaceutical coverings or coatings are familiar to the skilled worker. Customary additives may be, for example, release agents, pigments, stabilizers, antioxidants, pore formers, penetration promoters, aromatizing substances or flavorings. They serve as processing aids and are intended to ensure a reliable and reproducible production method and good long-term storage stability, or they achieve additional advantageous properties in the pharmaceutical form.<br>
Release agents:<br>
Release agents usually have lipophilic properties and are usually added to spray suspensions. They prevent agglomeration of the cores during film coating. Those preferably employed are talc, Mg stearate or Ca stearate, ground silica, kaolin or nonionic emulsifiers having an HLB of between 3 and 8. The usual amounts employed of ' release agents in the coating and binding agents of the invention are between 0.1 to 10% by weight based on the pharmaceutical form.<br>
Pigments:<br>
Addition takes place only rarely in the form of the soluble dye. Usually aluminum or iron oxide pigments are dispersed. The amounts of pigments normally employed in the coating and binding agents of the invention are between 1 and 10% by weight, based on the pharmaceutical form.<br><br>
Of course, all the substances employed must be toxicologically acceptable and usable in medicaments without risk for patients.<br>
Further additives may also be plasticizers. Usual amounts are between 0 and 50, preferably 0 to 20, in particular 0 to 10, % by weight. However, it is particularly preferred for not more than 5% by weight or no plasticizer to be present, because the formulations are often sufficiently elastic merely through the presence of components (c), and additional plasticizer may lead to unwanted tackiness.<br>
Plasticizers:<br>
Plasticizers may influence the functionality of the polymer layer, depending on the type (lipophilic or hydrophilic) and amount added. Plasticizers achieve through physical interaction with the polymer a reduction in the glass transition temperature and promote film formation, depending on the amount added. Suitable substances usually have a molecular weight of between 100 and 20 000 and comprise one or more hydrophilic groups in the molecule, e.g. hydroxyl, ester or amino groups.<br>
Examples of suitable plasticizers are alkyl citrates, glycerol esters, alkyl phthalates, alkyl sebacates, succrose esters, sorbitan esters, diethyl sebacate, dibutyl sebacate and polyethylene glycols 200 to 12 000. Preferred plasticizers are triethyl citrate (TEC), acetyl triethyl citrate (ATEC) and dibutyl sebacate (DBS). Mention may moreover be made of esters which are usually liquid at room temperature, such as citrates, phthalates, sebacates or castor oil. Esters of citric acid and sebacic acid are preferably used. It is also possible to employ mixtures of plasticizers.<br><br>
The production methods<br>
The method of the invention provides for the production of an oral pharmaceutical form with immediate disintegration and active ingredient release even in the mouth, through vigorous mixing of components (a) , (b) and (c) in the melt. Suitable processing temperatures are in the range from 80 to 200°C, preferably from 100 to 180°C. A twin-screw extruder is preferably employed for the purpose of vigorous mixing in the melt. After the solidification, the mixture is ground to an active ingredient-containing powder. The average particle size of the powder should be 200 pm or less, preferably from 50 to 150 iim.<br>
The average particle size of the powders can be determined as follows: by air jet sieving to divide up the ground product easily into a few fractions. This method is somewhat less accurate than the alternatives in this measurement range. At least 70, preferably 90, % of the particles, based on mass (mass distribution), should be in the size range according to the invention of 200 pm or less, preferably from 50 to 150 yim. A very suitable measurement method is laser diffraction to determine the particle size distribution. Commercially available apparatuses permit measurement in air (Malvern S3.01 particle sizer) or preferably in liquid media (LOT, Galai CIS 1) . A precondition for measurement in liquids is that the polymer does not dissolve therein or the particles change in another way during the measurement. A suitable medium is, for example, a highly dilute (approx. 0.02% strength) aqueous polysorbate 80 solution.<br>
The active ingredient-containing powder can be processed to a tablet, suckable tablet, freeze-dried tablets, cast tablets or pastilles, sachets, chewable tablets, powders for reconstitution, lozenges and/or liquid-filled lozenges.<br><br>
This processing usually takes place in a plurality of steps - Firstly, the active ingredient-containing copolymer powder is mixed with pharmaceutical excipients and can for example be compressed directly to tablets, suckable tablets or chewable tablets. The mixture can also be made into a paste with water, packed into a mold and freeze dried to result in freeze-dried tablets. Cast tablets or pastilles can be obtained by mixing the active ingredient-containing copolymer powder, e.g. with a saccharide solution at elevated temperature, pouring into a mold, e.g. for tablets or lozenges, and allowing to solidify by cooling. Liquid-filled lozenges can be produced by injecting a liquid mixture comprising the active ingredient-containing copolymer powder, e.g. in a sugar solution, into a solid casing composed for example of a sugar, and subsequently closing the latter.<br>
Active ingredient-containing powder<br>
The active ingredient-containing powder has an average particle size of 200 \im or less, preferably from 50 to 150 pm and comprises<br>
(a)	an anionic active pharmaceutical ingredient which is in the form of a solid solution and is incorporated into<br>
(b)	a copolymer which consists of free-radical polymerized Ci to C4 esters of acrylic or methacrylic acid and further (meth)acrylate monomers which have functional tertiary amino groups, and<br>
(c)	5 to 50% by weight, based on (b) , of a C12 to C22 carboxylic acid,<br>
(d)	with the proviso that less than 3% by weight, based on the copolymer, or no emulsifier having an HLB of at least 14 is present.<br><br>
Uses<br>
The active ingredient-containing powder can be used to produce an oral pharmaceutical form with immediate disintegration and active ingredient release even in the mouth, which causes no bitter taste for at least 30 seconds after release. The pharmaceutical form may be in the form of compressed tablets or suckable tablets, freeze-dried tablets, cast tablets or pastilles, sachets, chewable tablets, powders for reconstitution, lozenges and/or liquid-filled lozenges.<br>
Bitterness values<br>
The taste masking can be tested	in a simple manner<br>
organoleptically by  tasting.  In	this  test,  no  or<br>
slightly bitter taste should be	perceptible for at<br>
least  30  seconds  after  active	ingredient  release.<br>
Determination of bitterness values	is more accurate. No<br>
or slightly bitter taste corresponds to bitterness<br>
values below 1000.<br>
Bitterness values can be determined by DAB 1999 method 2.8.N8 (determination of the bitterness value).<br>
Whereas, for example, ibuprofen has a bitterness value of around 100 000, the value according to the invention for an incorporated anionic active ingredient is usually below 1000, preferably below 100. A bitterness value of 1000 is usually sufficient for pharmaceutical practice.<br><br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Copolymers used in the examples:<br>
Eudragit® E PO: copolymer powder composed of methyl<br>
methacrylate,  butyl methacrylate,  and dimethylamino-<br>
ethyl  methacrylate  in  the  ratio  25:25:50  with  an<br>
average particle size of 15 pm.<br>
Eudragit® E 100:  copolymer of methyl methacrylate,<br>
butyl methacrylate, and dimethylaminoethy1 methacrylate<br>
in the ratio 25:25:50 in granular form.<br>
The effectiveness of the taste masking was tested organoleptically by tasting. This entailed ascertaining the time between putting in the mouth and occurrence of the bitter taste.<br>
Example 1:<br>
Compound with 1 mol of dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate<br>
units contained in the copolymer Eudragit® E PO: 1 mol<br>
