				<td>WIDE RANGE CONTINUOUS DILUTER<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to diluting engine exhaust or other gases that contain small particles.<br>
2.	Background Art<br>
In order to characterize engine exhaust particulate matter (PM) emissions, it is required that the engine exhaust be diluted. Because the engine emits a high concentration of particles, the engine exhaust must be diluted with a high dilution ratio (typically greater than 100:1) to reach the measurable range of certain particle number instruments. The number concentration of engine exhaust particles may vary in a wide range. This is due to the variety of engine technologies and operating conditions. To satisfy these requirements and obtain accurate results, wide range dilution capability is required.<br>
The typical traditional partial flow diluter controls dilution air flow and total mixture flow with mass flow controllers. The sample flow is calculated by subtracting the dilution air flow from the total mixture flow. The dilution ratio is calculated by dividing the total mixture flow by the calculated sample flow. At low dilution conditions, this approach provides an accurate dilution ratio calculation.<br>
As the dilution ratio increases, the accuracy of the calculated dilution ratio drops due to the uncertainties of the total flow and dilution air flow measurements. This results in inaccurate characterization of the emissions. Therefore, use of dilution systems employing the typical traditional partial flow diluter has been limited to somewhat lower dilution ranges, such as 40:1 or lower.<br>
For the foregoing reasons, there is a need for an improved diluter. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide an accurate approach to diluting engine exhaust, and other gases that contain small particles, with wide range dilution capabilities.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a diluter that maintains accuracy under high dilution conditions.<br>
The invention contemplates an improved partial flow diluter. The wide range continuous diluter of the invention allows variation of the dilution ratio, in preferred embodiments, from 1:1 to over 1000:1. The dilution ratio can be controlled continuously in a wide range by changing the flow rate of a small makeup flow introduced after mixing, that causes the rate of the sample flow to change. The sample flow is measured directly, and the diluter provides a highly accurate dilution ratio over the operating range due to the sample flow being measured directly.<br>
In carrying out the invention, a wide range continuous diluter is provided. The diluter comprises a dilution air inlet, a sample gas inlet, and a mixer for mixing the dilution air and the sample gas. The diluter further includes a mixture outlet for receiving the mixture flow from the mixer. The total mixture flow is controlled by, for example, a critical orifice or mass flow controller. The dilution air flow is controlled by, for example, a mass flow controller. A well-defined flow (constant or variable) flows to the measuring instrument from the mixture flow.<br>
A flow of make-up air is provided to the total mixture flow, after the mixer. In this way, by changing the flow rate of the make-up air, the sample flow rate is changed as well. This approach allows continuous adjustment of the dilution ratio.The dilution ratio can be--adjusted over a wide range The sample flow is<br>
measured, for example, with an orifice flow meter.   As a result, the calculated dilution ratio is accurate over a wide dilution range.<br>
If desired for a particular application, a feedback control loop may control the dilution ratio. For example, when the system requires a constant dilution ratio, a proportional/integral/derivative (PID) loop may be employed to control the dilution ratio by manipulating the make-up air flow.<br>
Further, it is appreciated that, in a preferred embodiment, the sample flow rate is measured by an orifice flow meter. In this case, particle losses over the orifice flow meter can be ignored. Accurate detection of the pressure drop across the orifice flow meter is assured by applying different orifice flow meters per the dilution ratio. The most appropriate flow meter can be chosen automatically or manually.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, to minimize the small particle losses at high dilution ratio, the invention comprehends using a by-pass flow upstream of the orifice flow meter to reduce the residence time of the flow in the transfer line.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
FIGURE 1 is a wide range continuous diluter made in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention; and<br>
FIGURE 2 is a block diagram illustrating a method in a preferred embodiment of the invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
In Figure 1, the preferred embodiment of the wide range continuous diluter is generally indicated at 10. A dilution gas inlet 12 receives a dilution gas, and a sample gas Jnlet44-receives a-sample-gasrTA--mixer 16 is connected to dlilution<br>
gas inlet 12 and sample gas inlet 14 for receiving and mixing the gases at a dilution ratio. The flow rate of the dilution gas is controlled by mass flow controller 18. Orifice flow meter 20 measures the sample gas flow rate. By-pass flow outlet 22 is provided upstream of flow meter 20 to reduce the residence time of the sample gas flow through the transfer line 15, which connects inlet 14 to the expected sampling source, for example, engine exhaust.<br>
Mixer 16 has outlet 30, and instrument flow outlet 32 is arranged to provide a well-defined flow into the instrument. The gas mixture flows at a controlled rate provided by critical orifice 34 and vacuum source 36. Critical orifice 34 may alternatively be a mass flow controller. Make-up gas inlet 38 provides make-up gas into the gas mixture flow controlled by mass flow controller 40.<br>
With continuing reference to Figure 1, orifice flow meter 20 includes absolute pressure transducer 42, pressure transducer 44, and a plurality of differently sized orifice flow meters. Each orifice flow meter includes a valve 50, a thermocouple 52, and an orifice 54. When engine particulate matter (PM) mass measurement is required, a pre-weighted filter 60 and holder is installed upstream of the make-up air.<br>
A feedback control loop controls the dilution ratio in this embodiment by varying the make-up gas flow such that the dilution ratio tracks a desired value. More specifically, feedback signal 64 is compared to reference signal 62 at summer 66 to produce an error signal. PID control 68, based on the error signal, determines the command signal for mass flow controller 40. In this way, it is possible to track to a constant dilution ratio or any other suitable reference signal.<br>
In operation, there are six flows. All flow rates in the following description are at the same conditions, either the standard or reference conditions. Qby-pass is the by-pass flow upstream of the orifice 54. The purpose of the by-pass flow is to minimize the residence time of the sample flow before entering the flow meter 20. The particle losses for small particles (less than 20 nanometers) by diffusion mechanism- are-mimmized-in  the-sampling line Qtotal is theToral mixture<br>
flow in the system. Q,total is controlled as a constant by critical orifice 34, or a mass flow controller. Q,total is the particle free dilution air flow, and is controlled as a constant by mass flow controller 18. Qs is the sample flow, and is measured by orifice flow meter 20 in real-time. Qmake.up is the make-up air flow. The make-up air flow can be adjusted, and the flow rate is controlled by mass flow controller 40. In normal operations, Qmakc.up is much smaller than Qair. However, under some conditions, Qmakc.up can be larger than Qair. Qinsirumenl is the flow into the instrument or filter, that is well-defined and can be either constant or varied.<br>
The sample flow and the dilution air or gas are mixed in mixer 16. Mixer 16 provides the uniform mixing of the sample flow and dilution air. Since flows of the dilution air and the sample flow are measured upstream of mixer 16 any kind of mixer can be used in the system. In some applications, hot dilution air is required. A heating system could be installed to heat the dilution air and the mixer for such applications.<br>
The flow in the diluter can be defined as<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
	In this illustrated preferred embodiment, the total flow and the dilution air flow are maintained as constants during operation.<br>
By adjusting make-up air flow Qmate.up, total flow Qtotal will remain constant. As a result, sample flow Q,s is changed. For example, while the make-up air flow is increased, the sample flow will decrease to maintain the constant total flow; in the opposite, while the make-up air flow is decreased, the sample flow will increase to maintain the constant total flow.<br>
The dilution ratio (DR) can be defined as:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Because the dilution air flow does not change, the dilution ratio is a function of the sample flow only. When the sample flow is decreased with the increase of the make-up flow, the dilution ratio increases. In the opposite case, when the sample flow is increased with the decrease of the make-up flow, the dilution ratio decreases.<br>
Since the make-up air is adjusted continuously, the sample flow is changed continuously. As a result, the dilution ratio is continuously controlled. A 1:1 ratio can be achieved without the dilution air flow (Qalr=0).<br>
The sample flow Qs is measured by orifice flow meter 20 which includes multiple internal flow meters. Each internal flow meter includes a thermocouple 52, an orifice 54, and a valve 50. In operation, the valves are manipulated to select the appropriate internal flow meter. When the sample flow Qs<br>
I<br>
is changed, the pressure drop across orifice 54 changes as well. The pressure drop is measured by pressure transducer 44. To maintain an accurate pressure measurement from pressure transducer 44, when the system runs under high dilution ratio (for example, greater than 100:1 and with a small sample flow rate), the internal flow meter with a smaller orifice will be chosen. The orifice selection process is controlled either automatically or manually. As shown, orifice flow meter 20 includes a pair of internal flow meters.<br>
The flow rate through an orifice is calibrated as a function of the pressure difference over the orifice at the standard or reference conditions. The calibrated curve is generated by a precise flow meter, and expressed as a polynomial equation. For pressure differences that are not specifically calibrated, these flow rates can be calculated with the equation.<br>
During operation, the sample flow temperature and pressure may not be at the standard or reference conditions. Absolute pressure transducer 42 and a thermocouple 52 measure the absolute pressure and temperature of the sample flow, respectively. Then, the sample flow can be corrected to the standard or reference<br>
conditions.   A corrected sample flow is used in the above mentioned equation (Equation 2) to obtain the dilution ratio.<br>
With continuing reference to Figure 1 , the system is equipped with a PID control system to provide stable dilution ratios. If a constant dilution ratio is required during operation, the PID control system will be activated. The PID controller adjusts the make-up air to achieve the constant sample flow. As a result, constant dilution ratios are obtained. In Figure 1, orifice flow meter 20 provides a feedback signal 64 that is compared with reference signal 62 at summer 66. The resulting error signal is processed by PID controller 68, which determines the command signal for mass flow controller 40.<br>
In some applications, it may be required to check if there are particles in the system when the sample flow is turned off. This test is called zero check.<br>
The diluter 10 provides a unique way to do zero check. By adjusting the make-up ak to be large enough, it is possible to cause the sample flow to flow in an opposite direction to keep the constant total flow. As a result, there is no sample flow into the instrument. With this approach, the instrument can detect if there are leaks in the system or particles in the dilution air.<br>
When engine particulate matter (PM) mass measurement is required at the same time as the number or size measurement, a pre-weighted filter and holder are installed upstream of the make-up ak, as shown in Figure 1 at 60. The flow Qfilter flowing through filter 60 is expressed as: (Formula Removed)<br><br>
This measurement can also be obtained alone without running the number or size measurement simultaneously.<br>
In Figure 2, a preferred meihod of operating diluter 10 is illustrated. At block .7.0.,make.-up-air-flow-is--pr-ov-ided-to-the -total-mixture" flow. At block" 72,<br>
the sample gas flow rate is measured to calculate the dilution ratio. At block 74, the dilution ratio is controlled by manipulating the make-up airflow to vary the sample gas flow rate.<br>
While embodiments of the invention have been illustrated and described, it is not intended that these embodiments illustrate and describe all possible forms of the invention. Rather, the words used in the specification are words of description rather than limitation, and it is understood that various changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br><br><br>
