     GRANTED<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br><br>
This invention relates to a method for preparation of a Lithographic Printing Plate and to a Lithographic Printing Plate produced by the method.<br>
The product can also be described using the following terms: Direct-to-Plate Inkjet Lithographic Printing Plate, Computer-to-Plate or CtP Inkjet Lithographic Plate, Computer-to-Poly or CtPoly Inkjet Lithographic Plate). The plate consists of a flexible hydrophilic substrate that is imaged using inkjet printers / plotters for use as a printing plate on an offset printing press.<br>
In particular, this invention relates to a method of preparing a lithographic printing plate for use by means of Inkjet imaging on a substrate, particularly flexible hydrophilic substrate.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of this invention, it further relates to a method for enhancing the print run length (i.e. the number of copies or impressions that can be printed from the imaged plate) of the said plate through a process of fixation.<br>
Traditional methods of printing include letterpress printing, gravure printing, offset lithographic printing, and screen-printing. In recent times, with computerization and digital ization of graphic design, photography, page "compositions and image"transfer processes; digital printing has made rapid strides in the developed nations.<br><br><br>
   All printing processes utilize image carriers to print images on substrates      <br>
   such as paper, plastics, metal, etc. Various types of flexible metal, plastic or  <br>
   paper printing plates serve as image carriers in the offset printing process.<br>
The method of creating images on the printing plates has been a subject of considerable research spanning over several decades. Technologies have evolved from manual etchings &amp; engravings to photo-mechanical imaging using Ultra-violet light to digital imaging using green, blue, red, infrared &amp; violet lasers.<br>
Each printing process has its own typical requirements with regard to the image forming areas of the printing plate. With the gravure process, the image areas are recessed; with letterpress, the image areas are in relief or raised above the non-image or background areas; with screen printing, the image areas are etched out to allow the ink to pass through; offset is the only process where the image and non-image areas are on the same plane or surface.<br>
The offset plate, therefore, requires special manufacturing as well imaging process to impart oleophilic (ink loving) properties to the image areas, which have to be printed, and hydrophilic (water loving) properties to the non-image or non-printing areas. The substrate used for manufacture of offset printing plates consists of metals, aluminum being the most popular, or plastic (polyester being the preferred choice).<br>
Offset printing plates can be grouped into the following categories:<br><br><br>
First generation offset plates consist of grained and anodized aluminum plates. These require extended plate preparation time and complicated processing steps to be carried out by the end-user: whirled coating of a photo-sensitive layer; exposure through a film negative or positive; acid development; solvent-based etching; stencil removal, desensitization, gumming up, inking up, etc. The total time to process such a plate is approx. 90 minutes, and the print results are inconsistent and lack sharpness.<br>
The second generation offset plates, known as presensitized plates, consist of grained and anodized aluminum plates pre-coated with photosensitive diazo or photo-polymer coatings that are either positive working or negative working. Presensitised plates have a shorter processing cycle of approx. 5 to 10 minutes per plate consisting of exposure to UV light through a film negative or positive, removal of the coating in non-image area using suitable developers in an automatic processor or manually, and wiping the plate surface manually or in an automatic processor with a protective film of gum. These plates are supplied in pre-coated form by the manufacturer and have to be handled extremely carefully during transport, storage and handling by the end user, as they are extremely sensitive to daylight, heat and moisture.<br>
As mentioned, presensitised plates require the use of an intermediate film positive or negative to serve as a mask at the time of exposure. In a positive plate, the film positive blocks the UV light from exposing the coating in the image areas, whereas it renders the coating in the non-image areas soluble through light reaction and dissolves away during the wet development process. In a negative plate, the film negative allows the light to expose the image areas and renders them insoluble in the developer; therefore, they<br><br><br>
remain on the plate after wet development while the original unexposed coating is removed from the non-image areas. The time for preparation of the film positive/negative and the costs involved, are the main limitations of the presensitised plate.<br>
A third generation offset plates, known as digital plates, consist of grained and anodized aluminum coated with coatings that are specially formulated to be reactive to different types of lasers. With the advent of digital technology, original pictures and words are now created or converted into digital formats in a computer. These digital images are then transferred from the computer in the desired format and page composition to a laser-imaging device known as the Platesetter or CtP (Computer-to-Plate) Imaging Device. The digital page is then exposed directly on to the digital plate in the Platesetter, The plate is then developed in a processor to remove the non-image areas, followed by application of a protective film of specially formulated gum. The total processing time per plate is similar to presensitised plates, but the time &amp; costs involved for preparation of the intermediate film positive/negatives are eliminated.<br>
Three types of digital offset plates are currently offered:<br>
A.	Thermal Plates that are sensitive to heat &amp; imaged using Infrared<br>
lasers (830 or 1064 nanometers).<br>
B.	Silver-sensitized Plates that are exposed using Violet (410nm), or<br>
Green (YAG 532 nm), or Red (HeNe 670nm) lasers.<br>
C.	Photopolymer Plates that are exposed using Violet (410nm) or Blue<br>
(Argon 488nm) or Green (YAG 532nm) or Red (HeNe 670nm) lasers.<br><br><br>
All the digital plates mentioned above require very expensive and unwieldy laser Platesetters and involve chemical processing, with some of the chemicals requiring conformity with stringent disposal norms. In addition, the plates are very expensive. Consequently, the advantages of speed and the savings of film intermediates are nullified by the additional costs. Therefore, Digital Plates have not met with universal acceptability and their use is limited currently to the high-end newspapers &amp; commercial printers where speed is of essence.<br>
To overcome some of the limitations of the above-mentioned varieties of digital plates, the applicant introduced an affordable, simple and safe digital offset plate "NovaDom*" Polyester Laser Plate (*trademark of the applicant). This plate is made from polyester (PolyEthylene Terephthalate - Also known as PET) base and is imaged directly on a toner-based laser printer. It does not require the use of any chemicals for processing after imaging, and can go directly to an offset press for printing approx. 20,000 copies from each side of the plate. Each side of the plate consists of specially coated surface, which is hydrophilic, and yet capable of establishing a durable bond with the toner deposited in the image areas by a laser printer. The image formed by the laser printer toner acts as the Oleophillic receiver, and picks up ink on the press for transfer to the offset blanket and then on to the paper or other printing substrate.<br>
NovaDom Polyester Laser plate has proved to be one of the most popular digital printing plates for small format single and spot color printing, worldwide. NovaDom plate won the world"s most prestigious award viz.<br><br><br>
The InterTech Technology award from GATE (Graphic Arts Technical Foundation), USA in 1995, for being "a unique innovation that will impact the future of the printing industry" (in the words of the Judging Committee). (GATF is the world"s largest independent, industry run, research organization for the printing &amp; allied industries. Its annual awards for product innovations are the industry equivalent of the Nobel Prize. Past winners consist essentially of global conglomerates, and the applicant is the only winner from outside of the North America, UK, North Europe and Japan since the inception of the Awards 20 years ago,)<br>
NovaDom, and other brands of polyester laser plates that followed, suffer from the limitation of inherent in a laser printer viz. the maximum plate size that can be accommodated on the current generation of laser printers is A3. The image resolution and registration accuracy is also limited by the capability of the laser engines, thereby rendering this plate unsuitable for high quality four-color process printing.<br>
This invention overcomes the limitations of NovaDom and other Polyester Laser Plates, by providing a method of making and imaging a plate that is suitable for imaging on standard large-format inkjet printers using standard inks such as HP 51645A, HP 51640A,and HP 51629A of Hewlett Packard; Epson T 5431 Photo Black, Epson T480011Black; Epson T5437 Light Black; Epson T5432 Cyan, Epson T483011 Cyan; Epson T5434 Yellow, Epson T481011 Yellow; lipson T5435 Light Cyan, Epson T485011 Light Cyan; Epson T5436 Light Magenta, Epson T484011 Light Magenta. The aforesaid is an illustrative list of inks, not meant to be exhaustive.<br><br><br>
This invention also seeks to provide a Hydrophilic substrate according to invention, that can be imaged using standard commercially available inks on a range of Inkjet printers using piezo, thermal, bubble jet or continuous ink jet technology.<br>
In recent years, inkjet printers have replaced laser printers as the most popular output device for graphic printing. The advent of these printers have made it. possible to output in sizes ranging from A8 to super-wide format printing. These printers are of low cost and their reliability has improved significantly in recent times. The resolution capabilities have greatly enhanced, e.g. Epson 7600 is capable of delivering resolution of up to 2400 dpi.<br>
Various disclosures have been made of the use of inkjet systems for creating an image on grained &amp; anodized aluminum printing plates and other hydrophilic lithographic surfaces. All of these methods and claims pertain to use of specific oleophilizing compounds used as the imaging medium in either liquid or semi-solid (wax) form in the printer"s ink cartridge, in place of the standard inkjei printing ink.<br>
In one such disclosure US Pat No 5,501,150 [no Indian equivalent] a fluid ink and hydrophilic media set containing materials to produce a silver reducible image by inkjet printing, is used to make a metallic silver image. Major disadvantages are the complexity of the imaging fluid and the need to wet process the silver image to make it sufficiently hydrophobic.<br><br><br>
In another such disclosure wherein the ink is a solid or phase change type ink as per US Patent No 4,833,486 [no Indian equivalent] to deposit hot wax on to surface of an offset plate is described. The roundness of the solidified droplet does not have the resolution of the liquid inkjet.<br>
US Patent no 5,511 477 [no Indian equivalent] discloses a method for producing a photo polymeric relief type printing plates using a photo polymeric ink composition suitable for forming a negative or positive image.<br>
US Patent No 5312654 [no Indian equivalent] also discloses a method for making lithographic printing plate using photo polymerisable ink composition on a hydrophilized ink composition. The said image is sensitized to cure the image by exposure to actinic light.<br>
Research disclosure 289118 [no Indian equivalent] discloses a method for making printing by means of an inkjet wherein the ink is hydrophobic polymer latex.<br>
The critical aspect of disclosures mentioned above, and other methods published, necessitate the need for specially formulated compounds to serve as imaging inks. None of them claim to work with standard commercially available inkjet printing inks supplied by the manufacturers of inkjet printers. Also, none of them claim original work done to produce a lithographic plate that can be imaged satisfactorily on inkjet printers and other non-impact and mechanical printer using standard commercially available inks. The Plate made as per our invention can be imaged on standard inkjet printers using standard inkjet inks as mentioned above. In<br><br><br>
addition, the Plate can also be imaged on other non-impact printers such as laser printer, etc. as well as impact devices such as photocopier, dot-matrix printer, etc.<br>
Use of specially formulated imaging fluids &amp; compounds referred to in the disclosures mentioned above, create considerable technical &amp; practical usage problems with regard to filling into, and compatibility with, the inkjet cartridges required to be used on inkjet printers. Many of the inkjet printers come with proprietary cartridges and proprietary inks, and contain proprietary microchips, which control the level of ink and respond to the print head. The printers are also able to identify whether the cartridge is genuine. It is not feasible to fill specially formulated imaging fluids in these cartridges, as the guarantee on the performance of the printer becomes void if the original cartridge &amp; ink combination not used. Also, there are other potential complications such as to damage to print heads and ink conduit lines. Moreover, cartridges supplied by the proprietary imaging fluid manufacturers filled with their own imaging fluids, cannot be used on printers as they do not contain the printer manufacturer"s microchips. What is clearly unique about the Plate under this invention is that it does not require the use of specially formulated imaging fluids and instead, works with the standard inkjet cartridges &amp; inks supplied by printer manufacturers.<br>
Unlike the Plate under this invention, none of the disclosures referred to above claim compatibility with non-impact digital printing devices (e.g. laser printer), nor do they claim compatibility with impact printers (e.g. dot-matrix printer) and manual imaging methods (e.g. calligraphy).<br><br><br>
Some Patent disclosures mention presensitised metal plates (i.e. metal plates that are grained, anodized and coated with photosensitive coatings) that are imaged on inkjet printers using special inks or fluids. These plates have not found commercial acceptability, as they are not flexible enough to be transported easily through inkjet printers and create difficulties especially where the transport path is not straight. Importantly, this methodology also suffers from the problems referred to above viz. rejection by the inkjet printers of non-proprieiary ink-cartridges filled with imaging fluids. Also, none of these Patent disclosures claim compatibility with all types of Inkjet printing devices as well as other non-impact printers (such as laser printers) and impact printers (such as dot-matrix printers) and manual imaging (such as calligraphy).<br>
The Plate under the present invention is compatible with non-impact printers (inkjet as well as laser printers), non-impact printers (including dot-matrix printers), and manual imaging methods (including calligraphy). The Plate under this invention is made from a flexible plastic material, and is compatible with standard inkjet inks and cartridges.<br>
The said invention also pertains to the development of an ink receptive substrate, wherein a reverse printing of up to 6 points is possible.<br>
This invention, therefore, extends the boundaries of the currently available technology as well as the applicant"s own polyester laser plates.<br><br><br>
The uniqueness of this invention is the development of a flexible polyester-based plate that can be imaged with the recommended standard commercially available inkjet inks on standard commercially available Inkjet printers, without the need to wet process the plate after imaging, and having the capability to print high-resolution four color process work. This polyester inkjet plate can also be imaged on other non-impact and impact-printing devices such as laser printers, photocopiers, dot matrix printers, and typewriter using oil based ribbons, thermal printers. The quality of the images would depend upon the capability of the imaging device. The print capability of the plate on an offset press would remain more or less unchanged; with the print run iength dependent on the imaging device and the press settings, Experimenis conducted indicate run length varying from 20,000 copies from each side when imaged using an Epson inkjet printer to 5,0(30 copies using a laser printer or photocopier.<br>
Another unique feature is that this Plate can also be imaged using manual methods such as writing on the Plate using calligraphic pens and lithographic inks. Hand-written additions, including signatures, etc can also be incorporated using special addition pens filled with oleophilic inks.<br>
This Plate is also unique as it can be coated with conventional wipe-on diazo coating. These diazo coatings can be wiped on to the Plate surface by hand, and exposed to an ultraviolet light source through a film negative. Thereafter, it can be processed in the normal manner using the standard wipe-on lacquer developer. The print quality of the Plate would be similar to conventional plates.<br><br><br>
This invention also pertains to the development of an ink receptive substrate, wherein a 2% dots could be effectively reproduced, with instant drying, no smudging, no background scumming, dot gain as per industry standards, and print resolutions matching commercial printing requirements.<br>
When used with inkjet printers, this Plate is unique as it uses standard inks, which result in low costs and easy integration of the plate imaging process into the normal workflow used in offices, print shops and publishers.<br>
This Plate is also unique as it does not suffer from size limitations of polyester laser plates since inkjet printers are available in large format (width of 60" and more).<br>
The Plate is uniquely capable of very high resolution including stochastic screens (frequency modulated screens) used for reproducing high quality multi colour photo realistic images.<br>
Another unique and useful feature is that the same inkjet printer mat is used for imaging this Plate can also be used for digital colour proofing of a four colour print job. This ensures a very close match between the colour proof and the final printed result obtainable from the printing plates imaged on the same printer. Large format inkjet printers are used extensively in printing and newspaper establishments for proofing. This polyester inkjet Plate would integrate seamlessly into their current workflow.<br>
It is also an object of the present invention to provide a simple and inexpensive method for preparation of a Direct-to-Print printing plate<br><br><br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a method to make plates for use with commercially available inks and development of a hydrophilic substrate to suit the commercially available inks for inkjet printing, such as Ink HP 51645A,HP 51640A,and HP 51629A of Hewlett Packard. Ink Epson T 5431 photo black, Epson T48001 IBiack. Ink Epson T 5437 Light Black. Ink EpsonT 5432 Cyan, Epson T 483011 Cyan. Epson Ink T 5434 Yellow, Epson T 481011 Yellow. Epson Ink T 5435 Light Cyan, Epson T 485011 Light Cyan. Epson Ink T 5436 Light Magenta, Epson 484011 Light Magenta and the like.<br>
Another object of this invention is to reproduce image imaged through any and all inks, which are pigment-based inks in the market and the upgrades.<br>
Another object of this invention is the development of the ink receptive substrate, wherein a 2% dots could be effectively reproduced.<br>
A further object of the invention is the development of an ink receptive substrate, wherein a reverse printing of up to 6 points is achieved.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to provide a lithographic plate that is able to receive information thereon for the purposes of reproduction from any output device including a typewriter, a cyclostyling apparatus, a dot matrix printer, an inkjet printer or a laser printer or even by manual application of the matter to be reproduced.<br><br><br>
Yet another object of this invention pertains to development of a hydrophilic substrate, which can also be imaged through a Laser printer for preparation of a lithographic printing plate.<br>
The invention provides compatibility to reproduce image imaged through any and all inks, which are pigment-based inks in the market and the upgrades. When used with inkjet printers, this plate offers several unique advantages:<br>
The invention provides compatibility to reproduce image imaged through any and all inks, which are pigment-based inks in the market and the upgrades. Standard inks can be used. Therefore, costs would be low and the plate imaging process would integrate into the normal workflow used in offices, print shops and publishers.<br>
It is an object of this invention to provide a plate, which is compatible for use with conventional diazo, photo polymer and thermal plate coatings. A further objective is the development of a hydrophilic substrate as per invention, which can be imaged through a thermal transfer process with a thermal ribbon for preparation of a lithographic printing plate. Yet another objective is the development of a hydrophilic substrate, which can be imaged through calligraphy using special inks for preparation of a lithographic printing plate, or via a typewriter with oil based ink ribbons for preparation of lithographic printing plate.<br>
Typically, in accordance with this invention the hydrophilic substrate can be treated using a photochemical method with a photosensitive coating. This<br><br><br>
when used with a image stencil for masking could on exposure to actinic light form an image which could be used as a lithographic printing plate. The said photo sensitive coating could be positive or a negative working polymeric system.<br>
Further, the unique coating designed with an ink receptive layer, could be a universal imaging base for preparation of a lithographic printing plate.<br>
According to this invention there is provided a simple and inexpensive method for preparation of a Digital Printing Plate that can be imaged on standard digital printing devices.<br>
The method of this invention has the following amongst other steps: Selection of a right substrate for making of the printing plate: Preferably the said substrate could be any natural or synthetic polymeric sheet element material. Preferably the said substrate described has a tensile strength in the range of 400 to 3000 Kgm/cm2 the preferred range being between 1600 to 2400 Kgm/cm2.<br>
Preferably the said substrate is suitably heat treated to have shrinkage in the range of 0.2 to 2.0 % when exposed to heat at l"50c/10 min, the preferred range being between 0.4 to 0.8% shrinkage. Preferably the said substrate has a nominal thickness in the range of 50 Mic to 250 mic, the preferred thickness range being between 75 mic to 175 mic.<br>
There is no size restriction for the plate for use as a lithographic printing plate hence there is no restrictions in terms of the width or length and<br><br><br>
therefore plates can be made for any wide format printing up to 4 meters in width. The size of the plaies made in accordance with the method of this invention can be any size from A8 to AO.<br>
The plates can be in rolls for imaging on the large format printers of length of up to 100 meters.<br>
In one aspect of the invention the substrate so selected could be a paper or paper laminate or co-extruded substrate of Polymeric plastics.<br>
In accordance with another embodiment of the invention the substrate could be selected from synthetic polymeric films typically, PVC /Poly laminates<br>
The method of preparation of the plate in connection with the said embodiment involves treatment of the substrate to alter the surface energy of the substrate to allow better wetting properties and improved bonding of the functional coating.<br>
The effectiveness of the plate in terms of resistance to abrasion during printing is critical to the bonding of the said lithographic coating.<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the invention one mode of preparing the substrate in connection with the said embodiment, a corona charge is used to improve the surface energy.<br>
In another embodiment of subbing the substrate in connection with the said embodiment, an acid treatment of halogenated aliphatic acid is used to etch<br><br><br>
the surface. Surface area is enhanced in the same method by embedding fused silica during the process.<br>
The said process for the same is critical to process temp used and residence time for etching the surface.<br>
In another mode of subbing in connection with the said embodiment polymeric resins are used to enhance the bonding features, e.g. like Polyurethane, polyester resin, polymers of Vinyl acetate, co polymers of Acrylates and substituted acrylates wherein the substituted alkyl groups could be a Methyl, Propyl, and Butyl etc. Co Polymers of Hydroxyl substituted acrylates and methacrylates and the like.<br>
In another embodiment of subbing the substrate in connection with the said invention, chlorinated phenols are used to etch the surface.<br>
The main feature of the process of the said invention is that the effectiveness of the plate in terms of resistance to abrasion during printing is critical to the bonding of the said lithographic coating.<br>
The Lithographic coating in connection with the said embodiment is hydrophilic and is achieved by at least a Single Ply and preferably two-ply of coating on the subbed substrate.<br>
Typically, a particularly suitable cross Linked Hydrophilic layer is obtained from a hydrophilic binder cross linked with a suitable cross linking agents,<br><br><br>
such as Formaldehyde, glyoxal, poly functional aziridine, ammonium zirconium carbonate, melamine type cross linker.<br>
The said cross linking is accelerated by use of suitable accelerators, such as Ammonium Chloride, Aluminum sulphate, aluminum chloride, ammonium carbonate, Sulphonic acids, alkane sulphonic acids, aromatic sulphonic acids.<br>
The accelerators allow the said cross-linking to be effective for web speed of up to 200 feet"s/min at a residence time of 30 sec<br>
Linked hydrophilic binder used above also can contain an inorganic pigment that increases the mechanical strength of the ply e.g. metal oxides of Silica, titanium, zinc, aluminum, tin or transitional metal.<br>
These pigments could also comprise of naturally available ores of silicates such as Mica, China Clay, aluminum silicates, Sodium silicates etc.<br>

The ink dried on the plate after 30 minutes and image was having dot gain and smudged.<br>
The image was fixed to the plate by curing at 140° Celsius in an oven for 3 minutes.<br>
The results obtained thereon were tested for print run length and even after 10,000 impressions the image remained intact. Coating hardness to abrasion with stood 10,000 prints run &amp; the coating remained intact.<br>
Resolution as determined by Dot Gain at 100 lpi in 2 to 100 % range, was not acceptable.<br>
This shows that for preparation of a Lithographic plate for use with Ink Jet application, the pore volume of silica usedjn Lithographic composition has significant impact on the print resolution.<br>

The ink dried on the plate within 5 minutes and a sharp image was formed ihereon in each case.<br>
The image was fixed to the plate by curing at 140° Celsius in an oven for 3 minutes.<br>
The results obtained thereon were tested for print run length and even after 10,000 impressions the image remained intact. Coating hardness to abrasion with stood 10,000 prints run &amp; the coating remained intact.<br>

However, resolution of reverse prints of 6-point size was smudged. This shows that for preparation of a Lithographic plate for use with Ink Jet application, the application of the composition in multiple Plies has significant impact on the print resolution.<br><br><br>
Example 9<br>
A Lithographic Printing Plate  in accordance with this  invention was<br>
prepared in the following manner:<br>
The subbing layer and method for subbing was the same as in Example 6. Separately a hydrophilic lithographic coating was formed by reacting grams of 240 grams of fully hydrolyzed Poly Vinyl alcohol and blended with 60 grams of Poly acryl amide solution in a kettle for two hrs at a temp of 80°c.<br>
This blend was used for dispersion of 770 grams of Tio2 and 260 Grams of particulate Silica of a pore volume of 1.2 ml per gm in a Kinetic disperser for two hrs.<br>
To this was added 15 grams of a cross linking agent Glyoxalin and 5 grams of cationic surfactant. The coating composition was homogenized in a Pearl mill for 6 hours.<br>
An aqueous composition as described above was coated in two plies using a pilot coater with direct comma roll applicator on the subbed element. The plate with the coating thereon was cured in an aerofoil dryer for 1 minute was the temperature was maintained at 150° Celsius.<br>
Several plates were prepared and used for printing images thereon via an Epson 7600 printer and 9600 using Epson T5431 Photo black Epson T 5437 Light Black and Epson 480011 Black inks and HP printer DeskJet series like HP 850.

The ink dried on the plate within 5 minutes and a sharp image was<br>
formed thereon in each case.<br>
The image was fixed to the plate by curing at 140° Celsius      in an<br>
oven for 3 minutes.<br>
The results obtained thereon were tested for print run length gave a<br>
print length of 1000 impressions.<br>
Coating hardness to abrasion did not withstand more than 1,000 prints<br>
run &amp; the coating weakened thereafter.<br>
Resolution as determined by Dot Gain at 100 lpi in 2 to 100 % range,<br>
wherein the   dot  gain  obtained  was  within  industry  acceptable<br>
tolerances   (quantify??).<br>
Resolution as determined by sharpness of reverse print, where in 6<br>
points size, was found to be sharp and clear.<br>
It is therefore seen that the addition of accelerator and catalyst is<br>
critical to impart coating hardness to abrasion and has an impact on<br>
the print run length. Example 10<br>

Example 12<br>
The same composition was prepared as that described in example 6 with the<br>
exception that the coated lithographic composition contained<br>
8 grams of methane sulphonic acid.<br>
An aqueous composition as described above was coated in two plies<br>
using a draw down bar on a subbed element.<br>
The coating was done to give a ply of 10 microns in the first ply and<br>
15 microns in the second ply.<br>
Each ply of the plate with the coating thereon was cured in an<br>
aerofoil dryer for 1 minute were the temperature was maintained at<br>
150° Celsius for each of the Ply.<br>
Several plates were prepared and used for printing images thereon via an Epson 7600 printer and 9600 using Epson T5431 Photo black Epson T 5437 Light Black and Epson 480011 Black inks and HP printer DeskJet series like HP 850.

When tested for print images as in the above examples the contrast was found to be superior to the non-UV absorber containing plates. The aesthetics of the image therefore improved.<br>
Example 14<br>
The same composition was prepared as that described in example 5 with the<br>
exception that the coated hydrophilic composition would also contain<br>
60  grams  of acid  treated  aluminum  oxide  and  200 grams  of<br>
