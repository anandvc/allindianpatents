				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a process for preparation of Bis (3-amino phenyl) methyl phosphine oxide based hexachloronadicimide resins used in preparation of composite materials for aerospace applications..<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Bis (3-amino phenyl) methyl phosphine oxide based hexachloronadicimides are basically a new type of nadicimide resins. These resins find their most important application in preparation of composite materials which are utilised in Aerospace applications. These composite materials are light weight and have right combination of mechanical and thermal properties. These are basically made from carbon or glass fibers which is further reinforced either by epoxy or by bis maleimides or by nadicimides resins. However, composite materials which are reinforced through epoxy resins can withstand temperature upto 120°C only. Similarly, composite materials which are reinforced utilising Bis maleimides can withstand temperature upto 250°C only. However, composite materials reinforced through Nadicimide resins can withstand temperature upto 400°C.<br>
Nadicimide resins are generally prepared by polymerisation of monomeric reactants (PMR) i.e. by the reaction of monomethyl ester of 5 -norbornene 2,3 -dicarboxylic acid and 4, 4' - diamino dipheylmethane in a suitable solvent which could be alcohol, acetone or tetrahydrofuran (THF). However, these nadicimides suffer from following disadvantages.<br>
The main disadvantage of these known resins is that both the resin solution and prepreg have to be stored at very low temperature around -15°C<br>
Yet another disadvantage of these known resins is that shelf life of these resins is around six months only.<br>
Still another disadvantage of these known resins is that one of the reactant, involved in the preparation of aromatic diamine, is highly carcinogenic causing cancer.<br>
Further disadvantage of these known resins is that during reinforcement of composite material, solvents evaporate causing voids in the composite material which adversely affect the mechanical properties of composite material.<br>

(i) reacting  hexachlornadic   anhydride   recrystallised  from  acetic anhydride with Bis (3-amino phenyl) methyl phosphine oxide in<br>
glacial acetic acid; (ii)  refluxing solution of Bis (3-amino phenyl) methyl phosphine<br>
oxide dissolved in acetic acid and then adding hexachloronadic<br>
anhydride; (iii)  precipitating  the  resultant  nadicimide  resin  in   100  ml  ice<br>
water;<br>
(b) preparation of 3.3', 4.4'-benzophenone tetracarboxylic chain extended Bis (3-amino phenyl) methyl hexachloronadicimide involves:<br>
(i) dissolving mononadicimide in dried acetone;<br>
(ii) addition of 3.3', 4.4'-benzophenorie tetracarboxylic acid di-anhydride;<br>
(iii) re fluxing  the solution;<br>
(iv) chemical cyclisation of amic acid to imide using preferably fused sodium acetate and acetic acid as cyclo-dehydrating agent;<br>
(v)       precipilating the resultant resin on crushed ice and water;<br>
(c ) prepration of pyromellitic chain extended Bis (3-amino phenyl)<br>
methyl hexachloronadicimide involving: (i) dissolving mono hexachloronadicimide in dry acetone; (ii) adding pyromellitic dianhydride; fiii) refluxing the solution; iiv) chemical cyclisation of amic acid to imide using fused sodium<br>
acetate and acetic acid as cyclodehydrating agent; (v) precipating the resin on crushed ice and water;<br>
In accordance with this invention there is provided a process for preparing a new type of Nadicimide i.e. mono Bis (3-amino phenyl) methyl phosphine oxide based hexachloronadicimide resin and Bis (3-amino phenyl) methyl phosphine oxide based hexachloronadicimide resin with extended chains which are prepared using performed oligomeric approach. Composite materials reinforced through such nadicimide resins, show better combination of mechanical and thermal properties. These nadicimide resins are basically prepared by polymerisation of monomeric reactants like monomethyl ester of nadic dicarboxylic acid and diamine in a solvent viz. alcohol, acetone, THF etc.<br>

phosphine   oxide   based  hexachloronadicimides   have  modified mechanical  and thermal properties.  The impact strength of  chain<br>
extended  Bis  (3-amino  phenyl)  methyl  phosphine  oxide   based hexachloronadicimides  is  more than that of  Bis  (3—aminophenyl)<br>
methyl  phosphine  oxide  based  monohexachloro  nadicimide.   The prepared hexachloronadicimides can be kept at room temperature and<br>
has  longer  shelf life.  The composite materials  resulting  from reinforcement  with these hexachloronadicimide resins have  better<br>
combination of mechanical and thermal resistant properties. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to present invention, Bis (3—aminophenyl)  methyl<br>
phosphine oxide based mono hexachloronadicimide and chain extended Bis     (3—aminophenyl)    methyl    phosphine     oxide     based<br>
hexachloronadicimides are prepared by following steps s (A)    Preparationof Bis (3-amino phenyl) methyl phosphine oxide<br>
based mono hexachloronadicitnide<br>
1 mole hexachloronadic anhydride recrystallised from  acetic<br>
anhydride  is  reacted  with 1 mole Bis  (3-amino  phenyl)  methyl<br>
o phosphine oxide in 20 ml glacial acetic acid and refluxed at 120 C<br>
and    atmospheric   pressure   for   approximate   8   hours.  The resultant    mono    hexachloronadicimide   is    precipitated  on<br>
crushed    ice  &amp;  cold   water.     The     precipitated     mono hexachloronadicimide  resin   is   washed    several   times  with<br>
water and aqueous sodium bicarbonate and dried under vacuum at 60 mm of mercury. The mono hexachloronadicimide resin thus obtained is purified by dissolving it in chloroform and precipitating in methanol.<br>
(B) Preparation of chain extended Bis (3-amino phenyl ) methyl phosphine oxide based hexachloronadicimides<br>
The mono hexachloronadicimide, prepared in above manner, can be chain extended by allowing it to react with different anhydrides.<br>
(i) 3,3'. 4,4'-benzophenone tetra carboxvlic chain extended Bis (3-amino phenyl) Methyl Hexachloronadicimide<br>
The mono hexachloronadicimide is dissolved in dried acetone (20 ml) at 60°C and then 0.005 mole of 3,3', 4,4'-benzophenone tera carboxvlic acid dianhydride is added to this portion. The solution is refluxed at 60 °C for four hours. This is again followed by chemical cyclisation of the amic acid to imide using fused sodium acetate (0.1 gm) and acetic anhydride (2 ml) as the cyclodehydrating agent and refluxed for 1 more hour. Again the resultant resin is precipitated on crushed ice and 100 ml water. The precipitated resin is washed several times with water and aqueous sodium bicarbonate.<br>
(ii) Pvromellitic chain extended Bis (3-amino phenyl) Methyl Hexachloronadicimide<br>
.01 mole of mono hexachloronadicimide is dissolved in 20 ml dry acetone at 60°C and .005 mole of pyromellitic dianhydride was added in portion. The solution was refluxed at 60°C for 4 hours followed by chemical cyclisation of amic acid to imide using 0.1 gm fused sodium acetate and 2 ml acetic acid as the cyclodehydrating agent. Again the resultant resin is precipitated on crushed ice and 100 ml water. Finally, this precipitated chain extended Bis (3-amino phenyl) methyl hexachloronadicimide is washed several times with water and aqueous sodium bicarbonate and dried under vacuum.<br>
After completion of chemical process, structural characteristics of these hexachloronadicimides are determined with the help of Infrared Spectroscopy and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy whereas thennal characteristics of these hexachloronadicimides are determined with<br>
the help of Differential Scanning Calorometery and Thermo Gravimetric Analysis technique.<br>
