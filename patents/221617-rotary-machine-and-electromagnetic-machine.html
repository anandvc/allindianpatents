KANJI INOKI, A JAPANESE NATIONAL OF 104 WEST 40TH STREET, #1510, NEW YORK, NY 10018, U.S.A. AND YUKIO KINOSHITA A JAPANESE NATIONAL OF KYOWADAINI BUILDING 4F, 2-7-8, SHIBADAIMON, MINATO-KU, TOKYO 150-0012, JAPAN.<br>
THE	FOLLOWING	SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br>
I<br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a magnetic pole configuration that can improve performance and efficiency for motors or power generators for use in rotary machines or transport devices utilizing magnets.<br>
TECHNICAL BACKGROUND<br>
Synchronous motors of the present time having permanent magnets embedded therein have been widely used with the knowledge that a permanent magnet-type synchronous motor can operate at constant speed with high efficiency. Particularly, along with the advancement in rare earth material, the performance and miniaturization of permanent magnets have advanced significantly. Nevertheless, the method of using permanent magnets has not been developed fully and the same is true for permanent magnetic-type power generators.<br>
For example, Japanese Patent Publication No. 2001-156947 discloses a magnetic-type electronic motor and power generator. In this prior art, magnets are arranged in a radial manner in the motor or power generator. In addition, to further increase performance, the length of a rotor with magnets introduced therein is made longer in the axial direction than that of a stator, thereby enhancing the magnetic flux generated in the gap between the stator and the rotor.<br>
Japanese Patent Publication No. 2002-238193 discloses another example which is a motor. In this prior art, the magnets are arranged circularly. This invention is characterized by a recessed portion provided in the areas where the ends of the permanent magnets adjoin each other on the outer circumference of a rotor with built-in permanent magnets.    This prior an describes that the gap between the inner circumference of the<br>
2<br><br>
stator and the outer circumference of the rotor is enlarged in the areas where the ends of permanent magnets adjoin each other. In other words, the large magnetic reluctance that exists in the gap causes the magnetic flux distribution between inner circumference of the stator and the outer circumference of the rotor to appear substantially like a sine wave, thereby reducing the cogging torque. Japanese Patent Publication No. 2002-118994 discloses another example.<br>
One of the targets of this invention is a synchronized motor with permanent magnets embedded inside the rotor. To provide a rotor configuration that can reduce the cogging torque without skewing the rotor, the present invention provides a configuration in which the magnetic poles switch from N to S or S to N at different angles. In this case, the permanent magnets are arranged circularly, which is the most popular layout. Nevertheless, the efficiency, performance, and output thereof are not fully developed.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>

FFECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
" -" One aspect of the present invention is a rotary machine utilizing magnets, wherein the magnets are inserted to be arranged radially on a rotor; subsections of the rotor magnetic poles arranged radially are shaped asymmetrically such that subsections of the magnetic pole of the rotor react to the polarity of a stator that is either the same and<br>
6<br><br>
opposite in a relative sense. When the adjacent stator and the rotor have the same (different) polarity in the primary position, they repel (attract) each other and simultaneously attract (repel) at a subsection position where the stator and the rotor have different (sartte) polarities. This configuration provides a smooth transition between the reciprocal motions of the stator and the rotor, thereby enhancing the performance of the rotating electronic device and reducing the torque cogging phenomenon that induces vibrations.<br>
Another example of the present invention provides a rotating machine utilizing magnets, wherein rotor magnetic poles are arranged not at a uniform pitch or angle but at non-uniform pitch angles with a given relative angular displacement; magnets are inserted to .be arranged radially and circularly to construct the rotor; gaps or non-magnetic member portions are provided on the periphery of the magnets such that the magnetic flux generated by the circularly arranged magnets will not return to the rotor magnets directly, thereby increasing the magnetic flux in the gap portion in the rotor and the stator while reducing the magnetic flux loss thereof. Hence, the rotating electronic device is enhanced in terms of performance and the cogging phenomenon that induces vibrations is diminished.<br>
Another example of the present invention provides a rotary machine utilizing magnets, wherein magnets are inserted to be arranged radially and circularly to the rotor; a subsection of the rotor magnetic poles arranged in a given manner is shaped asymmetrically such that the subsection of the rotor magnetic pole corresponds to the polarities of a stator being electromagnetically coupled being relatively the same or opposite. When the adjacent stator and the rotor have the same (different) polarity in the primary position, they repel (attract) each other and simultaneously attract (repel) at a subsection position where the stator and the rotor have different (same) polarities. This configuration provides a smooth transition between the reciprocal motions of the stator and the rotor, thereby significantly enhancing the performance of the rotating electronic device and significantly diminishing the torque rouging phenomenon that induces vibrations.<br>
Another example of the present invention provides a rotary machine utilizing magnets, wherein magnets are inserted to construct the rotor in the run-out component of the rotor constructed with magnets positioned in an area whose length is longer than the axial length of a stator that is constructed with electromagnetically coupled iron cores; the<br>

inner side defined by facing magnets, one arranged radially and the other arranged circularly within the run-out component of the rotor, having the same polarity; the inner side defined by facing magnets, one arranged radially and the other arranged circularly in a non-run-out component of the rotor, having the opposite polarity in a relative sense.<br>
Accordingly, the magnetic flux in the gap portions in the rotor and the stator is significantly increased and the magnetic flux loss is significantly reduced. Hence, the rotating electronic device is significantly enhanced in terms of performance and the cogging phenomenon that induces vibrations is significantly diminished.<br>
Another example of the present invention is a rotary machine and an electromagnetic device incorporating a rotary machine utilizing magnets. A stator comprises magnetic poles constructed with a strong magnetic member and armature windings. Permanent magnets are arranged radially and circularly on a rotor, wherein the magnetic flux generated by the permanent magnets arranged radially on the rotor is approximately twice as much as the magnetic flux generated by permanent magnets arranged circularly thereon. On the rotating surface of the rotor, the grooves are formed on magnetic pole configurations made of a strong magnetic member on the rotor and the shape and width of the grooves are given a fan-like shape in advance to modify the magnetic flux distribution utilizing a fluxmeter in such a manner that the harmonic component of the magnetic flux distribution waveform is reduced from the rotating surface and substantially a sine wave is obtained wherein the magnetic flux is enhanced along the center line 'Df the magnetic poles in the magnetic pole configuration made of a strong magnetic member while being mitigated toward the boundary between adjacent magnetic poles. Additionally, the use of an adjustment groove provides an efficiency of 95% or greater at several kW for a motor in a miniaturized rotating electronic device.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Various embodiments of the present invention are described herein.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates the rotating electronic device 1 of Embodiments 1, 2, 3, and 4 together. Reference Numbers 21, 22, 23, and 24 are rotors; 3 is a stator; 15 is a rotating shaft; and 16 is a winding. Figure 2 shows Embodiment 1 of the present invention. Reference Number 21 is a rotor, 41 is an iron core magnetic pole comprising an electromagnetic steel plate of rotor 21, and 5 is a magnet on rotor 21. Magnets 5 are positioned to form a radial shape on magnetic pole 41. Reference Number 6 is a groove; and 7 is a fitting hole.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates an example of rotor configurations in which the rotor magnets are arranged in a conventional radial manner for reference.<br>
In the configuration of the magnetic pole 41 of rotor 21 in which magnets 5 are arranged radially, subsections 8 of the magnetic poles 41 of rotor 21 are given a projecting configuration which is formed asymmetrically. Conventionally, subsections 8 are formed symmetrically. Rotors 21 may be flipped and overlaid via fitting hole 7 provided on rotor 21. The superpositioned pole 41 on the rotor thus provides an aggregate angle that is larger than that of a single rotor 21. As a result, the subsections on the rotor reach a point at which they can react to magnetic poles of the stator not only having the same polarity but also having the opposite polarity in a relative sense.<br>
In rotating electronic device 1 which operates as a power generator or motor, when the [adjacent] stator 3 and the rotor 21 have the same (or different) polarity in the primary position, they repel (or attract) each other and simultaneously attract (repel) at a subsection position where adjacent stator 3 and rotor 21 have different [(same)] polarities. This configuration provides a smooth transition between the reciprocal motions of the stator<br>
12.<br><br>
and the rotor, thereby enhancing the performance of rotating electronic device 1 and reducing the torque cogging phenomenon that induces vibrations.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates Embodiment 2 of the present invention. Reference Number 22 is a rotor, and 42 is an iron core made of electromagnetic steel plates on a rotor. On magnetic pole 42, magnets 5 are arranged radially, magnets 9 are arranged circularly, and grooves 10 and 11 are provided thereon. An iron core magnetic pole is made of electromagnetic steel plates. Figure 5 illustrates the rotor configuration, for reference, on which magnets are arranged in a conventional radial fashion. Gaps or non-magnetic member portions are provided on the periphery of the magnets to prevent the magnetic flux generated by the circularly arranged magnets from directly returning to magnets 9, thereby increasing the magnetic flux that is present in the gap portions in the rotor and the stator.<br>
Magnets 5 are arranged to face adjacent magnets having the same polarity. Magnets 5 on rotor 21 have for example 6 magnetic poles which are arranged not at an interval of 60 degrees but arranged in the following manner: each of the five magnetic –poles 4s positioned at an angle pitch expressed as 60 degrees x (170 ~ 176) / 180. The remaining one magnetic pole is positioned at an angle expressed as 60 degrees + 5 degrees x (170-176) /180. On the other hand, magnets 5 on stator 3, in the case where there are 6 magnetic "poles thereon, are separated at an interval of 60 degrees. Therefore, magnets 5 on rotor 21 are positioned with some relative displacement with respect to the magnets on stator 3 that are electromagnetically coupled.<br>
The use of this configuration significantly improves the performance of rotating electronic device 1 and significantly suppresses the torque cogging, consequently reducing vibrations and the like.<br>
Rotor 21 is provided with slots arranged radially for inserting magnets 5 into magnetic poles 41, 42 of each magnetic pole iron core such that the lengths of magnets 5 can be adjusted in a radial direction. The capability of adjusting the radial length of magnets 5 and the presence of radial slots for inserting magnets 5 allow the use of magnets sized to fill out the slots. Accordingly, to obtain a particularly strong magnetic flux, strong magnets or full sized magnets that fill out the slots must be selected. The use of a detachable configuration for magnets 5, 9 makes changing or adjusting the properties of a<br>
13<br><br>
motor or power generator easy.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates Embodiment 3 of the present invention. Reference Number 23 is a rotor; 43 is an iron core magnetic pole of rotor 23 made of electromagnetic steel plates.<br>
On magnetic pole 43 of rotor 23, magnets 5 are arranged radially and subsections 6 are provided on the magnetic pole 43 configuration. Magnets 9 are arranged circularly and gaps or non-magnetic members are provided on grooves 10,11 around magnets 9.<br>
The combination of Embodiments 1 and 2 gives this configuration. Accordingly, this configuration provides the synergistic effects derived from characteristics of the two embodiments.<br>
For this reason, along with the significant increase in the magnetic flux in the gap portions of rotor 23 and stator 3, a significant increase in performance, a significant increase in cogging torque suppression and a significant reduction in vibration are accomplished by means of a coupling displacement between the magnetic poles on rotor 23 and stator 3, and the presence of subdivisions in the form of projection configurations 8 and the like provided between magnetic poles on rotor 23 and stator 3.<br>
Figures 7 and 8 illustrate Embodiment 4 of the present invention. Reference Number 1 is a rotating electronic device; any one of 24, 24a, 24b is a rotor; 3 is a stator; 44 is an iron core magnetic pole made of electromagnetic steel plates of rotors 24a, 24b. In rotating electronic device 1, magnets 5, 9 are inserted to construct the rotor wherein the run-out component of the rotor 24 is constructed with magnets 5, 9 positioned in an area whose length is longer than the axial length of the stator 3 constructed with iron cores electromagnetically coupled by windings 16; the inner side defined by facing magnets 5, 9, of which 5 is arranged radially and 9 is arranged circularly within the run-out component of the rotor 24, having the same polarity; the inner side defined by facing magnets 5, 9, of which 5 is arranged radially and 9 is arranged circularly in a non-run-out component of the rotor, having the opposite polarity.<br>
According to the above configuration as shown in Figure 4, in the "run-out area"<br>
14<br><br>
24a on rotor 24, the magnetic flux is generated along the arrow; in the "non-run-out area" 24b on rotor 24, the magnetic flux is generated along the other arrow. In effect, the magnetic flux generated in the "run-out area" 24a and that in the "non-run-out area" are superpositioned. ' This configuration allows a significant increase in the magnetic flux in the gap portion in proportion to the length of the "run-out area" on rotor 24 and stator 3. Hence, rotating electronic device 1 obtains significantly advantageous effects in terms of superior performance, reduced torque cogging, and suppressed vibrations.<br>
As a result, even though the rotating electronic device 1 is small in size, it can attain an excellent efficiency of 95 ~ 98%. Compared to the rotating electronic device 1 of conventional technology, the present invention can be much smaller.<br>
Figures 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 are cross-sectional views of the rotating electronic device of other specific configurations.<br>
- 104, 101', 102, 102' are permanent magnet type rotating electronic devices of the present invention. Reference Number 102 is a stator, 103 is a rotor. Stator 102 is constructed with armature windings 104 and stator magnetic pole iron cores 105. Rotor 103 is constructed in such a manner that permanent magnets 171, 172, and 173 [as shown in Figure 9] are combined and arranged radially and circularly for each magnetic pole. Reference Number 108 is a partition-assembly plate that isolates the phase derived from each permanent magnet of each phase. Figure 9 illustrates a configuration of rotor 103 having three rows and three sets.<br>
Note that Reference Number 112 is a rotating shaft; 113 is a rotating bearing; and 114 is a casing.<br>
In Figures 10 and 11, in the rotor magnetic pole iron cores 106, the magnetic flux derived from permanent magnets 171 arranged radially on each rotor 103 is about twice as much as that of permanent magnets 172 arranged circularly thereon.<br>
Regarding the magnetic flux of permanent magnets 171 arranged radially on rotor 3 and the magnetic flux of permanent magnets 172 arranged circularly on rotor 3, the magnetic flux distribution can be adjusted in advance using a fluxmeter by providing<br>
15<br><br>
fan-shaped configurations a, b of groove 109 and width c of adjustment groove 110 on the rotating surface of each magnetic pole on stator 102 and rotor 103.<br>
The--above configuration reduces the harmonic content in the magnetic flux distribution waveform generated by each magnetic pole on the rotating surface, thereby making the waveform substantially a sine wave.<br>
Regarding the magnetic flux of permanent magnets 171 arranged radially en rotor 3 and the primary magnetic flux of permanent magnets 172 arranged circularly on rotor 3, the magnetic flux distribution can be adjusted in advance using a fluxmeter by providing fan-shaped configurations a, b of groove 109 and the amount of secondary magnetic flux in accordance with the size or similar factor of permanent magnets 173 on the rotating surface of each magnetic pole on stator 102 and rotor 103.<br>
The above configuration enhances the amount of flux and reduces the harmonic content in the magnetic flux distribution waveform generated by each magnetic pole on the rotating surface, thereby making the waveform substantially a sine wave.<br>
To prevent the magnetic flux of permanent magnets 171 arranged radially on rotor 103 to be lost from the rotating shaft side, anti-flux loss groove 111 is provided and rotating shaft 112 is made of a non-magnetic member. This configuration effectively enhances the magnetic flux on the rotating surface.<br>
With respect to the interval between magnetic poles on rotor 103, in the quadruple magnetic pole configuration, as shown in Figures 10 and 11 for example, it is easy to arrange three of the magnetic poles at an pitch angle of 88 degrees while arranging the remaining magnetic pole at 96 degrees apart not illustrated. The use of a minimum of one magnetic pole arranged at an uneven interval in the above configuration or similar consideration prevents the rotor from experiencing a cogging torque. Naturally, the use of an uneven interval may be used together with skewing of the magnetic poles in each row and each set.<br>
According to the constitution of the present invention, a power generator used in miniaturized rotating electronic devices 101, 101' obtains a high efficiency of 95-98% at a<br>
16<br><br>
high output of several kW.<br>
In miniaturized rotating electronic device 102 as illustrated in Figure 12 which works as a power generator, new slots are provided to the outer circumferential portion for the magnets 171 inserted into the slots arranged radially about rotor iron cores 106 on rotor 105 of the present invention. Magnets 174 are inserted into the new slots such that the magnetic fields point in a radial direction such that repulsive and attractive forces are always generated between the magnetic pole formed on a stator and magnets 174 while the rotor spins at a synchronized speed to generate a driving force at all times during spinning. Hence the output is increased and efficiency is improved.<br>
In addition, in miniaturized rotating electronic device 102', which functions as a power generator, the use of non-magnetic member 120 or conductive non-magnetic member 121 for construction of rotor iron cores 106 of rotor 105 of the present invention further increases the output and efficiency, and allows the rotating electronic device to be activated by induction.<br>
, The use of electromagnets of superconductive material for permanent magnets 171, 172, 173, and 174 for the construction of rotor 103 allows the rotating electronic device to produce a high output and operate at a high efficiency.<br>
