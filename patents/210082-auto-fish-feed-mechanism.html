				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>The smart fish tank is designed and fabricated in such a way that an automatic mechanism is used to feed the fish in home aquarium with a specific quantity of food for every six hours. Mechatronics principles were applied in the design. A power supply unit along with a timer circuit is used to supply controlled power to electromagnet for every six hours. The electromagnet gets excited and attracts the metal door. This operation opens the food flow nozzle. Fish food stored in the food storage tank thus flows through the nozzle to the fish tank due to gravitational force. After three seconds, the power to electromagnet gets switched of so that the door closes due to spring tension. This action is carried out as the power supply to the electromagnetic circuit is cut off by the timer. The volume flow rate of the food can be controlled by varying the nozzle size, depending upon the number of fish inside the tank. The time interval for feeding the fish can also be varied. The experimentation operation went on uninterrupted for number of days. The results proved to be fruitful.</td>

— «;        AUTO FISH FEED MECHANISM<br>
■7T al	APPLICANT<br>
KONGU ENGINEERING COLLEGE, PERUNDURAI, ERODE 638052 TAMIL NADU, INDIA.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
An automatic fish feeding mechanism is designed and fabricated using components such as table(l)*, support rod(2), metal plate(3), electromagnet(4), nozzle(5), timer circuit(6), power supply system(7), fish tank(8), sliding stopper(9), and hopper(lO). The flow offish food from the hopper into the fish tank is controlled by a reciprocating mechanism and a nozzle. The reciprocating part called sliding stopper is connected to a metal plate which in turn is actuated by a timer controlled electromagnet. Thus the sliding stopper has a sliding contact with the nozzle. When the sliding stopper moves out or disengages the nozzle, the flow of fish food from the hopper is permitted into the fish tank. When the sliding stopper engages completely with the nozzle, the flow of fish food is stopped. The auto fish feeding mechanism along with the Fish tank was earlier titled as "Smart Fish Tank" as the system does not require the human interference and acts on its own. The system now is titled as "Auto Fish Feed Mechanism" as suggested by the examiner. The components are described below.<br>
OBJECTIVE<br>
To feed the home fish aquarium automatically in time with specified quantity of food at regular intervals.<br>
PREAMBLE<br>
It is now common to have a home fish aquarium in India and abroad. Feeding the fish at the appropriate interval has been a constraint due to many reasons. Feeding the fish at irregular intervals will affect the health and life of fish. This Project intends to provide a solution for such home fish growers by incorporating a control system that will take care of feeding fish at a given interval, automatically. Though a patent in US (No. 5072695) exists for such automation, the system invented and described is different. The following description will give the clarity.<br>
; * Note: The Number in the parenthesis indicates the part number referred in Fig-1 (Page 05 of Form 2).<br><br>
1.	Table<br>
A Wooden Table is used to support the fish tank. The size of the table varies according to the fish tank size.<br>
2.	Support Rod<br>
A Mild Steel flat support rod serves to hold the sliding stopper and the Electromagnet. The rod is fixed to the table for rigidity.<br>
3.	Metal Plate<br>
A metal plate(l mm thickness, 100 mm length and 15 mm wide ) made of mild steel provides the required feeding mechanism along with electromagnet, by the principle in which the plate gets attracted to electromagnet when it is energized. The plate is bent to "L" shape. A sliding stopper is attached to the metal plate (horizontal portion) which in turn is used to control the outflow offish food from the nozzle into the fish tank.<br>
4.	Electromagnet<br>
An electromagnet actuates the metal plate when it is energized by receiving signal from the timer. This electromagnet along with a timer is used to actuate the movement of the metal plate and thus the sliding stopper over the nozzle opening. This paves way for the sliding stopper controlling fish food feeding through nozzle.<br>
5.	Nozzle<br>
A Nozzle made of Galvanized iron feeds the food to the fish tank in which the volume flow rate can be controlled by varying the nozzle size. The diameter at the exit is 5 mm. Nozzles with desired exit size consisting of external screw threads can be fastened to a nozzle holder. The sliding stopper makes a sliding contact with the nozzle and controls the fish food falling from the hopper into the fish tank.<br>
6.	Timer Circuit<br>
A timer circuit is used as a controller in order to energize the electromagnet according to the feed time interval being set. A 5561C relay is used.<br><br>
7.	Power Supply System<br>
A DC supply system is used to supply energy for the electromagnet controlling the sliding stopper. AC to DC converter forms part of the power supply system.<br>
8.	Fish Tank<br>
A fish tank of size 700 mm X 500 mm X 500 mm is used to store water and grow fish as home aquarium. Water in the tank is stored up to a height of 45 cm. The fish tank also includes an aeration unit for keeping the water fresh.<br>
9.	Sliding Stopper<br>
A sliding stopper is a thin sheet metal making a sliding contact under the nozzle used for controlling the feed through the nozzle. The sheet is 15 mm wide and 50 mm in length.<br>
10.	Hopper<br>
A hopper serves as a container to hold the food. It can accommodate 150 gms of fish food. The hopper can store fish food required for a week time in such home aquarium. A nozzle is attached at the bottom of the hopper for controlled discharge of fish food. The exit portion of the hopper and the fastened nozzle is kept horizontal in order to suit a horizontally moving sliding stopper.<br><br>
The project is new w.r.t.   Document 5072695 and JP 7111843 cited in the following ways.<br>
This project comprises of hopper, sliding stopper (valve) and an electromagnet to actuate the valve. Fish food supply takes place due to a timer controlled electromagnet operating the valve, which is different from the quoted US patent.<br>
The patent 5072695 employs a rotating drum with a nozzle. When the nozzle reaches the bottom, the fish food is discharged into the fish tank. The discharge of fish food stops when the nozzle moves upward along with the drum rotation<br>
The feed dropping path claimed in JP 7111843 has a curved path and has a vertical plane opening. The patent JP 7111843 has an opening at the side face of the feed dropping path of the hopper and the feed controlling device is inserted in the vertical plane through the opening, whereas in this invention the sliding stopper is horizontal and moving against horizontal plane outlet of hopper which avoids the bend in the hopper. The flow of fish food is better in this invention than the one that is existing. Since bend is avoided the cost is also cheaper.<br><br><br><br>
