				<td>Process for preparing alkyl dihaloacetoacetates<br>
The invention relates to a process for preparing alkyl dihaloacetoacetates of the formula (I) by reacting α,α-dihaloamines of the formula (III) with carboxylic esters of the formula (II) in the presence of bases.<br>
Alkyl difluoroacetoacetates are important synthesis units for preparing active agrochemical ingredients, especially for preparing pyrazolylcarboxanilides.<br>
Tetrahedron 2001, 57, 2689-2700 discloses that 4,4-difluoroacetoacetic esters can be obtained by reacting ethyl difluoroacetoacetate with ethyl acetate in the presence of sodium hydride (NaH). The yield of this reaction is very unsatisfactory at 25%. Moreover, Tetrahedron 1996, 52, 119-130 states that 4,4-difluoroacetoacetic esters can be prepared by reacting ethyl difluoroacetate with ethyl bromoacetate in the presence of Zn.<br>
WO-A-2005/003077 teaches a three-stage process for preparing alkyl difluoroacetoacetates proceeding from chlorodifluoroacetoacetic esters by reducing the chlorine atom with trialkoxyphosphines (P(OAlk)3), which is also known as the Perkow reaction.<br>
WO-A-2006/005612 teaches a process for preparing 4,4-difluoro-3-oxobutyric esters by reacting 2,2-difluoro-N,N-dialkylacetamide with acetic esters in the presence of bases. The alkyl 4,4-difluoro-3-oxobutyrate is subsequently, as described in JACS, 73, 3684 (1951), reacted with trimethyl orthoformate and acetic anhydride to give ethyl (2-ethoxymethylene)-4,4-difluoro-methylacetoacetate which, according to US-A-5,489,624, can be converted using methylhydrazine to ethyl 3-difluoromethyl-l-methyl-4-pyrazolecarboxylate. The route described firstly includes a multitude of reaction steps, and the 2,2-difluoro-N,N-dialkylacetamide used is secondly not commercially available and can be obtained only in small yields of approx. 70% by fluorinating 2,2-dichloro-N, N-dialkylacetamide.<br>
The processes described before in the prior art have the disadvantage that the difluorocarbonyl halides, haloalkylcarboxylic anhydrides and haloacrylic esters used are expensive, cause corrosion problems and/or can be purified only with a high level of technical complexity.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a simpler and more economically viable process for preparing alkyl dihaloacetoacetates.<br>
The object is achieved, surprisingly, by a process for preparing alkyl dihaloacetoacetates of the formula (I)<br>

(Formula Removed)<br>
Bases<br>
The α,α-dihaloamines of the formula (III) are reacted with the carboxylic esters of the formula (II) typically in the presence of bases, which deprotonate the carboxylic esters in the α-position to the carbonyl group.<br>
According to the present invention, suitable bases are all of those which have sufficient basicity to deprotonate the carboxylic esters. Examples include alkali metal hydroxides, for example lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, alkali metal alkoxides, for example NaOMe, NaOEt, NaOt-Bu, KOt-Bu, hydrides, for example NaH, KH, alkyllithium reagents, for example n-BuLi or t-BuLi, LiN(iPr)2, Grignard reagents, for example CH3MgCl; phosphazenes and 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undecene (DBU).<br>
The a,a-dihaloamines are reacted with the carboxylic esters typically at temperatures of -50 to 60°C, preferably of-20 to 40°C, more preferably of-10 to 30°C.<br>
The reaction can be effected under reduced pressure, under standard pressure or under high pressure, preferably under standard pressure.<br>
The reaction can be performed in bulk or in a solvent. Preference is given to performing the reaction in a solvent. Suitable solvents are, for example, selected from the group consisting of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, for example n-hexane, benzene or toluene, which may be substituted by fluorine and chlorine atoms, for example methylene chloride, dichloroethane, fluorobenzene, chlorobenzene or dichlorobenzene; ethers, for example diethyl ether, diphenyl<br>
ether, methyl tert-butyl ether, isopropyl ethyl ether, dioxane, diglyme, dimethyl glycol, dimethoxyethane (DME) or THF; nitriles such as methylnitrile, butylnitrile or phenylnitrile; amides such as dimethylformamide (DMF) or N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) or mixtures of such solvents, particular preference being given to THF, DME, diethyl ether. The reaction can be effected in an excess of carboxylic ester (e.g. in ethyl acetate).<br>
The base and the carboxylic ester are preferably used in equimolar amounts. Alternatively, the base can also be used in excess. The ratio of basexarboxylic ester is, in accordance with the invention, between 1.5:1 and 0.9:1, preferably between 1.4:1, more preferably between 1.3:1, and 1.05:1.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the process according to the invention, the carboxylic ester is initially charged in bulk or dissolved in a suitable solvent and admixed gradually with the base and then reacted with the α,α-dihaloamine.<br>
Owing to the hydrolysis sensitivity of the α,α-dihaloamines, the reaction should be performed in anhydrous apparatus under inert gas atmosphere.<br>
The invention will be illustrated in detail with reference to the working examples which follow, but without restricting it thereto.<br>
Preparation examples<br>
Example 1:      Preparation of ethyl difluoroacetoacetate<br>
An initial charge of 48 g of ethyl acetate was admixed at RT with a 10% solution of 32.4 g of sodium ethoxide in ethanol. The mixture was stirred at RT for 1 h and then admixed with 36 g of 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyldimethylamine. Subsequently, the solution was stirred at 30°C for 2 h, admixed with H20 and adjusted to pH 5. After extraction with ethyl acetate and subsequent distillation, 27 g (65%) of ethyl difluoroacetoacetate (boiling point 90-94°C/100 mbar) were obtained.<br>
Example 2:<br>
Analogous to Example 1, except that sodium hydride was used in place of sodium ethoxide. The yield achieved is 79%.<br>
Example 3:<br>
Analogous to Example 1, except that l,l-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethyldimethylamine (prepared from N,N-dimethyldifluoroacetamide and oxalyl chloride at 80°C) was used. The yield achieved is 63%.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
