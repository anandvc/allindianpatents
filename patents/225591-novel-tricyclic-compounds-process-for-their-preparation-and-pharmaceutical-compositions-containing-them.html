Background of Invention<br><br>
Atherosclerosis and other peripheral vascular diseases are the major causes affecting the quality of life of millions of people. Therefore, considerable attention has been directed towards understandings the etiology of hypercholesterolemia and hyperlipidemia and development of effective therapeutic strategies.<br>
Hypercholesterolemia has been defined as plasma cholesterol level that exceeds an arbitrarily defamed value called "normal" level. Recently, it has been accepted that "ideal" plasma levels of cholesterol are much below the "normal" level of cholesterol in general population and the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) increases as cholesterol level rises above the "optimum" (or "ideal") value. There is clearly a definite cause and effect-relationship between hypercholesterolemia and CAD, particularly for individuals with multiple risk factors. Most of the cholesterol is present<br><br>
in the esterifies forms with various lipoproteins such as Low density lipoprotein (LDL), Intermediate density Up protein (IDL), High density lipoprotein (HDL) and partially as Very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). Studies clearly indicate that there is an inverse correlation ship between CAD and atherosclerosis with serum HDL-cholesterol concentrations, (Stumper et al, N. Engle J. Med, 325 (1991), 373-381) and the risk of CAD increases with increasing levels of LDL and VLDL.<br>
In CAD, generally "fatty streaks" in carotid, coronary and cerebral arteries, are found which are primarily free and etherified cholesterol. Miller et al, {Br. Med, J„ 282 (1981), 1741 - 1744) have shown that increase in HDL-particles may decrease the number of sites of stenos is in coronary arteries of human, and high level of HDL-cholesterol may protect against the progression of atherosclerosis. Picardo et al, {Arteriosclerosis 6 (1986) 434 - 441) have shown by in vitro experiment that HDL is capable of removing cholesterol from cells. They suggest that HDL may deplete tissues of excess free cholesterol and transfer it to the liver (Macikiimon et al, J, Biol Chem, 261 (1986), 2548 - 2552). Therefore, agents that increase HDL cholesterol would have therapeutic significance for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and coronary heart diseases (CHD).<br>
Obesity is a disease highly prevalent in affluent societies and in the developing world and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. It is a state of excess body fat accumulation. The causes of obesity are unclear. It is believed to be of genetic origin or promoted by an interaction between the genotype and environment. Irrespective of the cause, the result is fat deposition due to imbalance between the energy intake versus energy expenditure. Dieting, exercise and appetite suppression have been a part of obesity treatment. There is a need for efficient therapy to fight this disease since it may lead to coronary heart disease, diabetes, stroke, hyperlipidemia, gout, osteoarthritis, reduced fertility and many other psychological and social pr6blems.<br>
Diabetes and insulin resistance is yet another disease which severely effects the quality of Hf of a large population in the world. Insulin resistance is the diminished ability of insulin to exert its biological action across a broad range of concentrations. In<br><br>
insulin resistance, the body secretes abnomially high amounts of insulin to compensate for this defect, failing which, the plasma glucose concentration inevitably rises and develops into diabetes. Among the developed countries, diabetes mellitus is a common problem and is associated with a variety of abnormalities including obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia (J. Clin. Invest., (1985) 75 : 809 - 817; N. Engl. J. Med. 317 : 350 - 357 ; J. Clin. Endocrinol, Meaty., (1988) 66 : 580 - 583; J. Clin. Invest, (1975) 68 : 957 - 969) and other renal complications (See Patent Application No. WO 95/21608). It is now increasingly being recognized that insulin resistance and relative hyperinsulinemia have a contributory role in obesity, hypertension, atherosclerosis and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The association of insulin resistance with obesity, hypertension and angina has been described as a syndrome having insulin resistance as the central pathogenic link-Syndrome-X.<br>
Hyperlipidemia is the primary cause for cardiovascular (CVD) and other peripheral vascular diseases. High risk of CVD is related to the higher LDL (Low Dimity Lipoprotein) and VLDL (Very Low Density Lipoprotein) seen in hyperlipidemia. Patients having glucose intolerance / insulin resistance in addition to hyperlipidemia have higher risk of CVD. Numerous studies in the past have shown that lowering of plasma diglycerides and total cholesterol, in particular LDL and VLDL and increasing HDL cholesterol help in preventing cardiovascular diseases.<br>
Peroxisome proofreader activated receptors (PPAR) are members of the nuclear receptor super family. The gamma (y) isonomy of PPAR (Parry) has been impacted in regulating differentiation of adipocyte (Endocrinology, (1994) 135: 798-800) and energy homeostasis (Cell, (1995) 83: 803-812), whereas the alpha (a) isoforms of PPAR (PPARa) mediates fatty acid oxidation (Trend Endocrine. Metal., (1993) 4 : 291-296) thereby resulting in reduction of circulating free fatty acid in plasma (Current Biol. (1995) 5: 618 -621). PPARa agonists have been found useful for the treatment of obesity (WO 97/36579). It has been recently disclosed that title hypolipidemic effect is, enhanced when a molecule has both PPARa and Parry agonism activity and suggested to be useful for the treatment of syndrome X (WO 97”5042). Synergism between the<br><br>
muslin sensitize (PPARy agonist) and HMG CoA reductase inhibitor has been observed which is useful for the treatment of atherosclerosis and xanthoma. (EP 0 753 298),<br>
It is known that PPARy plays an important role in adipocyte differentiation (Cell, (1996) 87, 377-389). Ligand activation of PPAR is sufficient to cause complete terminal differentiation (Cell, (1994) 79, 1147-1156) including cell cycle withdrawal. PPARy is consistently expressed in certain cells and activation of this nuclear receptor with PPARy agonists would stimulate the terminal differentiation of adipocyte precious and cause morphological and molecular changes characteristics of a more differentiated, less malignant state (Molecular Cell, (1998), 465-470; Carcinogenesis, (1998), 1949-53 ; Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., (1997) 94, 237-241) and inhibition of expression of prostate cancer tissue (Cancer Research (1998), 58 ; 3344-3352). This would be useful in the treatment of certain types of cancer, which express PPARy and could lead to a quite nontoxic chemotherapy.<br>
Leptin resistance is a condition wherein the target cells are mixable to respond to lepton signal. This may give rise to obesity due to excess food intake and reduced energy expenditure and cause impaired glucose tolerance, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and such other interrelated complications. Allen et al (Proc, Natl. Acad. Sci., (1996) 93, 5793-5796) have reported that insulin sensitizers which perhaps due to their PPAR agonist expression lower plasma leptin concentrations. However, it has been recently disclosed that compounds having insulin sensitizing property also possess leptin sensitization activity. They lower the circulating plasma leptin concentrations by improving the target cell response to leptin (WO 98/02159).<br>
A few p-aryl-a-hydroxy propionic acids, their derivatives and their analogs have been reported to be useful in the treatment of hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and hypercholesterolemia. Some of such compounds described in the prior art are outlined below:<br><br><br><br>

Throughout the experimental period the animals were maintained on the same diet (Petit, D., Bonnefis, M. T., Rey, C and Infante, R. Effects of ciprofibrate on liver lipids and lipoprotein synthesis in normo- and hyperlipidemic rats. Atherosclerosis. 1988. 74 : 215-225).<br>
The test compoxmds were administered orally at a dose 0.1 to 30 mg/kg/day for 3 days. Control group was treated with vehicle alone (0.25 % Carboxymethylcellulose; dose lOmL/kg).<br>
The blood samples were collected in fed state 1 hour after drag administration on 0 and 3 day of compound treatment. The blood was collected fix)m the retro-orbital sinus through heparimsed capillary in EDTA containing tubes. After centrifiigation, plasma sample was separated for' total cholesterol, HDL and triglyceride estimations. Measurement of plasma triglyceride, total cholesterol and HDL were done using commercial kits (Dr. Reddy's Laboratory, Diagnostic Division, India). LDL and VLDL cholesterol were calculated from the data obtained for total cholesterol, HDL and triglyceride. The reduction of various parameters examined are calculated according to the formula.<br>
c)	Plasma triglyceride and total cholesterol lowering activity in Swiss albino<br>
mice and Guinea pigs ;<br><br>
Male Swiss albino mice (SAM) and male Guinea pigs were obtained from NIN and housed in DRF animal house. All these animals were maintained under 12 hour light and dark cycle at 25 ± 1 “C. Animals were given standard laboratory chow (NIN, Hyderabad, India) and water, ad libitum. SAM of 20 - 25 g body weight range and Guinea pigs of 500 - 700 g body weight range were used (Oliver, P., Plancke, M. O., Marzin, D., Clavey, V., Sauzieres, J and Fruchart, J. C. Effects of fenofibrate, gemfibrozil and nicotinic acid on plasma lipoprotein levels in normal and hyperUpidemic mice. Atherosclerosis, 1988. 70 : 107 - 114).<br>
The test compounds were administered orally to Swiss albino mice at 0.3 to 30 mg/kg/day dose for 6 days. Control mice were treated with vehicle (0.25% Carboxymethylcellulose; dose 10 mL/kg). The test compounds were administered orally to Guinea pigs at 0.3 to 30 mg”g/day dose for 6 days. Control animals were treated with vehicle (0.25% Carboxymethylcellulose; dose 5 mL/kg).<br>
The blood samples were collected in fed state 1 hour after drug administration on 0 and 6 day of treatment. The blood was collects firom the retro-orbital sinus through heparinised capillary in EDTA containing tubes. After centrifogation, plasma sample was separated for triglyceride and total cholesterol (Wieland, O. Methods of Enzymatic analysis. Bergeimeyer, H. O., Ed., 1963. 211 - 214; Trinder, P. Aim. Clin. Biochem. 1969. 6 : 24 - 27). Measurement of plasma triglyceride, total cholesterol and HDL were done using commercial kits (Dr. Reddy's Diagnostic Division, Hyderabad, India).<br><br><br>
