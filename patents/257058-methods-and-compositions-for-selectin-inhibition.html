METHODS AND COMPOSITIONS FOR SELECTIN INHIBITION<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the field of anti-inflammatory substances, and more particularly to novel compounds that act as antagonists of the mammalian adhesion proteins known as selectins.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
During the initial phase of vascular inflammation, leukocytes and platelets in flowing blood decrease velocity by adhering to the vascular endothelium and by exhibit rolling behavior. This molecular tethering event is mediated by specific binding of a family of calcium dependent or "C-type" lectins, known as selectins, to ligands on the surface of leukocytes. There are also several disease states that can cause the deleterious triggering of selectin-mediated cellular adhesion, such as autoimmunity disorders, thrombotic disorders, parasitic diseases, and metastatic spread of tumor cells.<br>
The extracellular domain of a selectin protein is characterized by an N-terminal lectin-like domain, an epidermal growth factor-like domain, and varying numbers of short consensus repeats. Three human selectin proteins have been identified, including P-selectin (formerly known as PADGEM or GMP-140), E-selectin (formerly known as ELAM-1), and L-selectin (formerly known as LAM-1). E-selectin expression is induced on endothelial cells by proinflammatory cytokines via its transcriptional activation. L-selectin is constitutively expressed on leukocytes and appears to play a key role in lymphocyte homing. P-selectin is stored in the alpha granules of platelets and the Weibel-Palade bodies of endothelial cells and therefore can be rapidly expressed on the surface of these cell types in response to proinflammatory stimuli. Selectins mediate adhesion through specific interactions with ligand molecules on the surface of leukocytes. Generally the ligands of selectins are comprised, at least in part, of a carbohydrate moiety. For example, E-selectin binds to carbohydrates having the terminal structure:<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2005/047258	PCT/US2004/037441<br>
NeuAca(2,3) Gaib(l,3) GlcNAcb(l,3)--- . R<br>
Fuca(l,4) and also to carbohydrates having the terminal structures:<br>
NeuAca(2,3) Gaib(l,4) GlcNAc— . R Fuca(l,3)<br>
where R is the remainder of the carbohydrate chain. These carbohydrates are known blood group antigens and are commonly referred to as Sialyl Lewis x and Sialyl Lewis a, respectively. The presence of the Sialyl Lewis x antigen alone on the surface of an endothelial cell may be sufficient to promote binding to an E-selectin expressing cell. E-selectin also binds to carbohydrates having the terminal structures:<br>
HSO3—.Galb(l,3)GlcNAc—.R HSO3—. Galb(l,4)GlcNAc—.R<br><br>
Fuca(l,4)	Fuca(l,3)<br>
As with E-selectin, each selectin appears to bind to a range of carbohydrates with varying affinities. The strength of the selectin mediated adhesive event (binding affinity) may also depend on the density and context of the selectin on the cell surface.<br>
Structurally diverse glycoprotein ligands, including GlyCAM-1, CD34, ESL-1 and PSGL-1 can bind to selectins with apparent high affinity. PSGL-1 is a mucin-like homodimeric glycoprotein expressed by virtually all subsets of leukocytes and is recognized by each of the three selectins. However PSGL-1 appears to be unique in that it is the predominant high affinity P-selectin ligand on leukocytes. High affinity P-selectin binding to PSGL-1 requires both a SLex containing O-glycan and one or more tyrosine sulfate residues within the anionic N-terminus of the PSGL-1 . polypeptide (See Sako, D., et al.. Cell 1995; 82(2): 323-331; Pouyani, N., et al., Cell 1995; 82(2): 333-343; Wilkins, P.P., et al., J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270:39 22677-22680, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). L-Selectin also recognizes the N-terminal region of PSGL-1 and has similar sulfation-dependent<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2005/047258	PCT/US2004/037441<br>
binding requirements to that of P-selectin. The ligand requirements of E-selectin appear to be less stringent as it can bind to the SLex containing glycans of PSGL-1 and other glycoproteins. Despite the fact that P-selectin knockout and P/E selectin double knockout mice show elevated levels neutrophils in the blood, these mice show an impaired DTH response and delayed thioglycolate induced peritonitis (TIP) response (See Frenette, P.S., et al., Thromb Haemost 1997; 78:1, 60-64, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Soluble forms of PSGL-1 such as rPSGL-lg have shown efficacy in numerous animal models (See Kumar, A., et. al., Circulation. 1999, 99(10) 1363-1369; Takada, M., et. al. J. Clin. Invest. 1997, 99(11), 2682-2690; Scalia, R., etal., CircRes. 1999, 84(1), 93-102, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
In addition, P-selectin ligand proteins, and the gene encoding the same, have been identified. See U.S. Patent No. 5,840,679, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. As demonstrated by P-selectin/LDLR deficient mice, inhibition of P-selectin represents a useful target for the treatment of atherosclerosis (See Johnson, R.C., et al., J. Clin. Invest, 1997 99 1037-1043, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). An increase in P-selectin expression has been reported at the site of atherosclerotic lesions, and the magnitude of the P-selectin expression appears to correlate with the lesion size. It is likely that the adhesion of monocytes, mediated by P-selectin, contributes to atherosclerotic plaque progression (See Molenaar, T.J.M., et al., Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003 (66) 859-866, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Given the role of selectins in numerous important biological processes, including inflammation and adhesion processes, and in disorders such as atherlosclerosis, it can be seen that there is a continuing need for new selectin inhibitors that can be useful in the treatment of a variety of diseases and disorders that are characterized by, or that involve selectin activity. This invention is directed to these, as well as other, important ends.<br>

The infection process involves selectin-mediated intercellular adhesion. Thus, the present invention also provides methods of treating or preventing an undesired infection process in a mammal, comprising administering to said mammal a compound of the invention. The infection can be mediated by a bacteria, a virus, or a parasite, and examples of such infection processes include gingivitis, periodontitis, hemolytic uremic syndrome, and granulocyte transfusion associated syndrome.<br>
Further examples of diseases and disorders that involve selectin-mediated intercellular adhesion include metastasis in cancer, and diseases or disorders associated with an undesired immunologica! processes, for example psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune thyroiditis, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, Grave's disease and immunological-mediated side effects of treatment associated with hemodialysis or leukapheresis.<br>
A further example is in organ transplantation, wherein patients generally receive immunosupressive therapy to minimize the possibility of rejection of the organ. Typical immunosupressive agents used for such therapeutic regimes include cyclosporine, rapamycin and tacrolimus. In some embodiments of the invention, a compound of the invention can be administered to the patient to receive the organ transplant in conjunction with one or more such immunosupressive agents. Thus, in some embodiments, the compound of the invention can be administered to an organ for transplant, by, for example, administering the compound to the patient prior to transplant, to the patient after transplant, or directly to the transplanted organ itself either before or after transplant (for example by perfusion), or in any combination. Thus, in preferred embodiments, the compound of the invention can be administered to an organ in conjunction with one or more immunosupressive agents; i.e., the<br>

Heating was continued overnight. After 18 hours, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature. The brown, lumpy precipitate was collected by filtration, washing with water, and dried overnight to give isoniirosoacetanilide (3.4 g) . lsonitrosoacetanilide (3.4 g) was added in small portions, with stirring, to 12.4 mL concentrated sulfuric acid which had been heated to 65 °C in a round bottom flask. The isonitroso was added slowly. After all the isonitroso had been added, the purplish-black solution was allowed to stir at 85 °C for 10 minutes, and was then poured onto crushed ice in a beaker. Additional ice was added until the outside of the beaker felt cold to the touch. The orange-brown precipitate was then collected by filtration and dried overnight to yield isatin 3, which was purified by extraction. Intermediate 3 (5.7 g) was extracted with 3 x 400 ml hot ethyl acetate and the insoluble was discarded.

The procedure described by Cragoe etal. (J. Org. Chem., 1953, 18, 561) was followed. A suspension of 6,7-cyclohexanoisatin (intermediate 3, 15.0 g, 74.3 mmol) in 80 mL 6 M aqueous potassium hydroxide was prepared in a 1 L 3-necked round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser, and heated to 100 °C. A solution of 4-chlorophenacyl acetate (intermediate 4, 19.7 g, 92.9 mmol) in 80 mL warm ethanol was added in small portions over the course of 1 hour. After all this solution had been added, the reaction mixture was heated at reflux for an additional 4 hours. It was then cooled to room temperature, and the ethanol removed under reduced pressure. The residue was diluted with 385 mL water, chilled for 30 minutes, filtered, and acidified to pH 1 with 1 M aqueous hydrochloric acid. The crude acid precipitate was collected by filtration and dried under vacuum. To purify the acid, it was first eluted over a silica gel column (flash chromatography, 70 ethyl acetate : 5 acetonitrile : 2.5 methanol : 2.5 water [+ 0.5% triethylamine]) to remove most of the highly colored impurities. The triethylammonium salt obtained was then suspended in 20% acetonitrile / water and converted back to the free acid by addition of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The acid precipitate was collected once again by filtration, dried under vacuum, and recrystallized in several batches from chloroform / ethanol to give pure Compound 2 as a pale yellow powder (3.03 g, 12% yield): 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-D6) ppm 1.84 (m, 4 H) 2.85 (t, J=5.56 Hz, 2 H) 3.25 (t, J=5.56 Hz, 2 H) 7.33 (d, J=8.84 Hz, 1 H) 7.58 (d, .7=8.59 Hz, 2 H) 8.15 (d, J=8.59 Hz, 2 H) 8.26 (d, J=8.84 Hz, 1 H).<br>

EXAMPLE 37 ASSAY OF COMPOUNDS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Compounds of the invention can be assayed for selectin inhibitory activity using any of the procedures known in the art. One convenient procedure is the determination of IC50 values for inhibition of P-selectin binding to P-selectin giycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) using Biacore.<br>
The Biacore 3000 is an instrument that uses surface plasmon resonance to detect binding of a solution phase analyte to an immobilized ligand on a sensor chip surface. The analyte sample is injected underflow using a microfluidic system. Binding of analyte to ligand causes a change in the angle of refracted light at the surface of the sensor chip, measured by the Biacore instrument in resonance units (RUs).<br>

WO 2005/047258	PCT/US2004/037441<br>
SGP-3 is a purified sulfoglycopeptide form of human PSGL-1 that contains the P-selectin binding determinants (See Somers et al., 2000, Cell 103,467-479). SGP-3 was biotinylated via amine chemistry at a unique C-terminal lysine residue and immobilized on streptavidin-coated SA sensor chip. A solution containing a soluble recombinant truncated form of human P-selectin comprised of the lectin and EGF domains (P-LE) was delivered to the SGP-3 coated sensor chip. The P-LE solution contains 100 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCI, 1mM CaCI2,1 mM MgCI2, 0.05% P40,10% DMSO. KD values were typically calculated to be approximately 778 +/-105nM using this Biacore assay format (Somers et al., supra).<br>
Small molecule P-selectin inhibitors are incubated for 1 hour in 100 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCI, 1mM CaCI2,1 mM MgCI2, 0.05% P40,10% DMSO, prior to introducing them into the Biacore 3000. Solutions are filtered if formation of precipitate is visible. Soluble P-LE is added to the small molecule solution at final concentrations 500 nM and 500 uM respectively. Sample injections are run in duplicates, and each compound is assayed at least twice.<br>
The Biacore assay measures the signal in RU produced by binding of P-LE to SGP-3 in the presence and absence of inhibitors. Percent inhibition of binding is calculated by dividing the inhibited signal by the uninhibited signal subtracting this value from one then multiplying by one hundred. Inhibitors, with greater than 50% inhibition at 500 uM, are assayed again using a series of two fold dilutions. The data from this titration are plotted, RU values vs. concentration, and the IC50 is determined by extrapolation from the plot. All RU values are blank and reference subtracted prior to percent inhibition and IC50 determination. Glycerrhizzin is used as a positive control, inhibiting 50% at 1mM.<br>
Compounds 1-6 were assayed as described above. IC50 values for four of the compounds ranged from 125//M to 500//M. One compound showed 17% inhibition at 500 mM, and one compound showed 11% inhibition at 125 mM.<br>
Compounds 7-10,17-20 and 22-33 also were tested as above. Six of the compounds displayed IC50 values ranging from 100mM to 1250 mM. The percentage inhibition at 250 mM for an additional three compounds ranged from 46% to 58%. The percentage inhibition at 500 mM for an additional ten compounds ranged from 5% to 55%, with three of the compound showing no significant percentage inhibition at that concentration. One further compound displayed 24%<br>
