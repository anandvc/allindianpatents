IL-21 PRODUCTION IN PROKARYOTIC HOSTS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The increased availability «nd identification of genes from human and other genomes has led to an increased need for efficient expression and purification of recombinant proteins. The expression o: proteins in bacteria is by far the most wideL used approach for the production of clcned genes. For man&gt; reasons, expression in bacteria is preferred to expression in euLaryotic cells. For example, bacteria are much easier to erow than eukarvotic cells. Mo-re specifically, the av. ailabilitv of a wealth of sophisticated molecular aenetic tools and thousands of mutants make E. coli, as an expression host, extremely useful for protein production. However, the high-level production of functional proteins in E. , N/., especially those from eukarvotic-sources has often been difficult.<br>
[L-21 (previously designated Zalphali Ligand) is a member of the JL-2 family of cytokines that also includes IL-4, IL-7, IL-9. EL-13. and EL-15. Proteins in this family have been shown to have both anti-cancer and ami-viral effects. IL-21 is produced by helper T-cells, which arb key regulators of immunity. Based on expression patterns of its cognate receptor and administration of the protein, it has been shown that IL-21 activates CDS+ killer T-cells ar.d natural killer (NK) cells, two classes of lymphocytes that eradicate tumors and virally infected cells. EL-21 also stimulates select classes of B-cells. (Parrish et ah, Nature 408:57-63, 2000).<br>
Recombinant IL-21 has been produced in prokaryotic cells, in particular E. coli. The resulting bacterial produced protein is not glycosylated, and is produced in an aggregated state. Production of IL-21 from E. coli requires that the aggregated proteins be solubilized from the insoluble inclusion bodies and renatured or refolded. Without renaturation, the specific activity of the recombinant protein will be significantly reduced.<br>
Despite advances in the expression of recombinant proteins in bacterial hosts, there exists a need for improved methods for producing biologically active and purified recombinant EL-21 proteins in prokaryotic systems which result in higher yields-for protein production. These and other aspects of the invention will become evident upon reference to the following detailed description.

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The following definitions Lire provided to facilitate understanding of the invention.<br>
As used herein, "nucleic acid", or "nucleic acid molecule'" refers to polynucleotides, such as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA or ribonucleic acid (RNA), oligonucleotides, fragments generated by the polymerase chain reaction iPCR). and fragments generated by any of ligation, scission, endonuelease action, and exonuclease action. Nucleic acid molecules can be composed of monomers thai are naturally-occurring nucleotides (such as DNA and RNA). or analogs of naturalh-occurring nucleotides (e.g., a-enantiomcric forms of naturally-occurring nucleotides), or a combination of both. Modified nucleotides can have alterations in sugar moieties and/or in p\rimidine or purine base moieties. Sugar modifications include, for example, replacement of one or more hydroxyl groups with halogens, alkyl groups, amines, and azido groups, or sugars can be functionalized as ethers or esters. Moreover, the entire sugar moiety can be replied-with sten^ally and electronically similar structures, such as aza-susars and carbocvclic susar analoss. Examples of modifications in a base moiety include alkylated purines and pyrimidines, acylated purines or pyrimidines, or other well-known heterocyclic substitutes. Nucleic acid monomers can be linked by phosphodiester bonds or analogs of such linkages. Analogs of phosphodiester linkages include phosphorothioate. phosphorodithioate, phosphoroselenoate, phosphorodiselenoate. phosphoroanilothioate. phosphoranilidate. phosphoramidate, and the like. The term "nucleic acid molecule" also includes so-called 'peptide nucleic acids," which comprise naturally-occurring or modified nucleic acid bases attached to a polyamide backbone. Nucleic acids can be either sinsle stranded or double stranded.<br>
The term "complement of a nucleic acid molecule" refers to a nucleic acid molecule having a complementary nucleotide sequence and reverse orientation as compared to a reference nucleotide sequence.<br>
An "enhancer" is a type of regulatory element that can increase the efficiency of transcription, regardless of the distance or orientation of the enhancer relative to the start site of transcription.<br>
"Heterologous DNA" refers to a DNA molecule, or a population of DNA molecules, that does not exist naturally within a given DNA cell. DNA molecules heterologous to a. oarticular host cell may contain DNA derived from the host cell<br><br>
species the., endogenous DN'A) so long as that host DNA is combined wi;h non-host DNA the. exogenous DNA». For example, a DN'A molecule containing .; non-host UNA segment encoding a polypeptide operably linked to a host DNA segment comprising a transcription promote!" is considered to be a heterologous DN'A molecule. Conversed, a heterologous DNA molecule can comp::se an endogenous sene operablv linked with an exogenous promoter. As another illustration, a DNA molecule comprising a gene derived from a wild-type cell is considered to be heterologous DNA if that DNA molecule is introduced into a mutant eel! that lacks the wilc-t\pe cene.<br>
The term "contig" denotes a nucleic acid molecule that has a contieuous stretch of identical or complementary sequence to another nucleic acid molecule. Contiguous sequences are said to "overtap" a given stretch of a nucleic acid molecule either in their entirety or along a partial stretch of the nucleic acid molecule.<br>
"Complementary DNA (cDNA)" is a single-stranded DNA molecule*that is formed from an mRNA template by the enzyme reverse transcriptase. Tvpieallv, a primer complementary to portions of mRNA is employed for the initiation of reverse transcription. Those skilled in the ait also use the term *;cDNA" to" refer to a double-stranded DNA molecule consisting of such a sinele-stranded DNA molecule and its complementary DNA rand. The term "cDNA" also refers to a clone of a cDNA molecule synthesized from an RNA template.<br>
An 'isolated nucleic acid molecule" is a nucleic acid molecule that is not integrated in the genomic DNA of an organism. For example, a DNA molecule that encodes a growth factor that has been separated from the genomic DNA of a cell is an isolated DNA molecule. Another example of an isolated nucleic acid molecule is a chemically-synthesized nucleic acid molecule that is not integrated in the genome of an organism. A nucleic acid molecule that has been isolated from a particular species is smaller than the complete DNA molecule of a chromosome from that species.<br>
'Linear DNA" denotes non-circular DNA molecules with free 5' and 3' ends. Linear DNA can be prepared from closed circular DNA molecules, such as plasmids, by enzymatic digestion or physical disruption.<br>
A "promoter" is a nucleotide sequence that directs the transcription of a structural gene. Typically, a promoter is located in the 5' non-coding region of a gene, proximal to the transcriptional start site of a structural gene. Sequence elements within promoters that function in the initiation of transcription are often characterized by consensus nucleotide sequences. These promoters include, for example, but are not limited to. EPTG-inducible promoters, bacteriophage T7 promoters and bacteriophage ,λpL. See Sambrook et ah, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd ed.. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY. 2001.   A o.pica! promoter<br><br>
will have three components, consisting of consensus sequences at -?5 and -10 with a sequer.ee oi between 16 and 1° nucleotides between them (Lisset, S. and Marcialit. HL Nude:,- Acids Res. 21: 1512. 1993). Promoters of this sort include the lac. :-p. irp-lac (tac) and trp-lacirrci promoters. If a promoter is an inducible promoter, then the rate of transcription increases in response to .m inducing agent. In contrast, the rate of transcription is not regulated by an inducing agent if the promoter is a constitutive promoter. Repressible promoters are also known.<br>
A '"core promoter" contains essential nucleotide sequences for promoter functi-MI. including the start of transcripdon. By this definition, a core promoter mav or ma\ not have detectable activity in the absence of specific sequences that may enhance the acdvity or confer tissue specific actiwiy.<br>
A "regulatory element' is a nucleotide sequence that modulates the activky of a core promoter For example, a eukaryotic regu!„:ory element may contain a nucleotide sequence that binds with cellular factors enabling transcription exclusively or preferentially in particular cells, tissues, or organelles. These types of regulatory elements are normally associated with genes that are expressed in a "cell-specific," "tissue-specific," or "organclle-specific"' manner. Bacterial promoters have regulatory elements that bind and modulate the activity-of the core promoter, such as operator sequences that bind activator or repressor molecules.<br>
A 'cloning vector" is a nucleic acid molecule, such as a plasmid, cosmid, or bacteriophage, which has the capability of replicating au:onomously in a host cell. Cloning vectors typically contain one or a small number cf restriction endonuclease recognition sites that allow insertion of a nucleic acid molecule in a determinable fashion without loss of an essential biological function of the vec:or, as well as nucleotide sequences encoding a marker gene that is suitable for use in the identification and selection of cells transformed with the cloning vector. Marker genes typically include genes that provide resistance to antibiotic.<br>
An 'expression vector" is a nucleic acid molecule encoding a gene that is expressed in a host cell. Typically, an expression vector comprises a transcriptional promoter, a gene, an origin of replication, a selectable marker, and a transcriptional terminator. Gene expression is usually placed under the control of a promoter, and such a gene is said to be "operably linked to" the promoter. Similar!;.', a regulatory element and a core promoter are operably linked if the regulatory element modulates the activity of the core promoter. An expression vector may also be known as an expression construct.<br>
A "recombinant host" is a cell that contains ^ heterologous nucleic acid mole;die. such as a cloning vector or expression vector.<br><br>
The term "expression" refers to the biosynthesis of a gene produe;. For example, in the case of a structural gene, expression involves transeripiton of the struc:ural gene inio mRWA .aid the translation of rnRNA into one or more polypeptides.<br>
The term "secretory signal sequence" denotes a DNA sequence that enemies a peptide (a "secretory peptide": that, as a component of a larger polypeptide, direct.s the larger polypeptide through a secretory pathway of a ceil ir. which it is synthesized. The larger polypeptide is commonly cleaved to remove :he secretory pepoJe during transit through the secretorv pathwav.<br>
A "polypeptide" is a polymer of amino acid residues joined by peptide bonds, whether produced natural!} or synthetically. Polypeptides of less than about 10 ami:* J acid residues are common!} referred to as "peptides.7'<br>
A "protein" is a macromolecule comprising one or more polypeptide chains. A protein may also comprise non-peptidic components, such as carbohydrate groups. Carbohydrates and other non-peptidic substituents may be added to a protein. Proieins are defined herein in terms of their amino acid backbone structures; subsotuents such as carbohydrate groups and non-peptidic groups are generally not specified, but may be present nonetheless.   -<br>
A peptide or polypeptide encoded^by a non-host DNA molecule is a "heterologous" peptide or polypeptide.<br>
An 'isolated polypeptide" is a polypeptide that is essentially free from contaminating cellular components, such as carbohydrate, lipid, or other proteinaceous impurities associated with the polypeptide in nature. Typically, a preparation of isolated pohreptide contains the polypeptide in a highly purified form, i.e., at least about 80% pure, at least about 90% pure, at least about 95% pure, greater than 95% pure, or greater than 99% pure. One way to show that a particular protein preparation contains an isola:ed polypeptide is by the appearance of a single band following sodium dodecyl sulfa:e (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the protein preparation and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of the gel. However, the term "isolated' does not exclude the presence of the same polypeptide in alternative physical forms, such as dimers or alternatively glycosylated or derivatized forms.<br>
The terms "ammo-terminal'* or "N-terminal" and "carboxyl-terminal" or "C-trrminal" are used herein to denote positions within polypeptides. Where the context allows, these terms are used with reference to a particular sequence or portion of a polypeptide to denote proximity or relative position. For example, a certain sequence positioned carboxyl-terminal to a reference sequence within a polypeptide is loca'.ed proximal to the carboxyl terminus of the reference sequence, but is not necy surily at the carboxyl terminus of the complete polypeptide.<br><br>
A "fusion protein" is a hvbricl protein exposed b&gt; a nucleic acid molecule comprising nucleotide sequences of at least two gores.<br>
The term "affinity tag' is used herein to clcn, :;* a polypeptide segment that can be attached to a second polypeptide to provide for purification or detection oi the second polypeptide or provide sites for attachment of the second polypeptide to a substrate. In principal, any peptide or protein for which an suuibody or other specific binding agent U available can be used as an affinity tag. Aruriry tags include a poly-histidme tract, protein A (Nilsson et uL. EMBO J. 4:10": ■. L9S5-: Nilsson et ai, Methods Enz\moi. 19S:3 (199 IV), glutathione S transferase Smith ar.d Johnson, Gene 67:31 (19S$o. G!u-Glu affinity tag (Grussenmeyer et ai, Pr-v. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:79:2 il9S:i). substance P, FLAG peptide (Hopp et u.'.. Biotechnology 6:1204 (1988 i). streptavidin binding peptide, or other antigenic epv.cpe or binding domain. See. in general. Ford et ai, Protein Expression and Purification 2*J5" (1991). DNA molecules encoding affinity tags are available from commercial suppliers (eye.. Pharmacia Biotech. Piscatavvay, NJ).<br>
The term "isotonic" is used herein for its conventional meaning, that is a tonicity equal to that of blood, equivalent to a 0.9^ solution of NaCl.   "An isotonic amount" of a salt is that amount required to make a solution isotonic or to produce an -isotonic solution upon reconstitutiotvof a lyophilized preparation.<br>
Concentrations are specified herein in units c: molarity or % w/v of liquid compositions. When the composition is in the form of a lyophilized powder, the concentrations of the respective components will be such as to provide the specified concentration on reconstitution of the powder.<br>
Due to the imprecision of standard analydeal methods, molecular weights and lengths of polymers are understood to be approximate values. When such a value is expressed as "about" X or "approximately" X, the stated value of X will be understood to be accurate to ±10%.<br>
EXPRESSION OF RECOMBINANT IL-21<br>
The present invention provides expression vectors and methods for producing recombinant EL-21 protein from a prokaryotic h-:st. IL-21 was previously designated zalphal 1 Ligand, and is fully described in commonly assigned U.S. Patent 6,307.024, incorporated herein by reference. In particular, the expression vectors and methods of the present invention comprise an E. coli expression system for the large scale production of IL-21 utilizing the EL-21 coding sequence with specific changes in nucleotides in order to optimize codons and mRNA second:.:', structure for translation •-in E. c/)li. Using the expression vectors and methc^aSii^ r::-^ennn\j^n^^<br><br>
gene was produced in E. coli to a level o!" greater than ! g/L in fed batch fermentation. The present inventors found that use of the E. cdi OmpT protease def:c:ent strain IT5K*0 as a production host overcame stability problems with IL-21 met. IL-21 met is the IL-21 coding sequence with a codon encoding an N-termmal Met added at the 5' end 01 the polynucleotide sequence. Using the expression vectors described herein significantly improved the yield o( recombinant protein recovered from me bacteria. Use of this production host strain yielded over 50 mg;L IL-21met inclusion rodies from shaker flask culture. In another embodiment, to facilitate the development of hieh cell dens;:} fed-batch fermentation, another E. coli strain. \V3 I10. was selected „s a host for the large scale production of IL-21. This host strain is non-pa:hogenie and can grow to high cell density in minimally defined fermentation media. The produce.-, itv of IL-21 me; in E. coli strain W3 110 was comparable to that obtained in E. coli strain UT5600 when produced in shaker flask and batch fermentations.<br>
The present invention also provides methods for recovering recombinant IL-21 protein from a prokaryotic host when the IL-21 protein is expressed bv the host and found within the host cell as amunglycosylated, insoluble inclusion h^dv. When the prokaryotic cell is lysed to isolate the inclusion bodies (also called rcfraetile bodies"), the inclusion bodies are aeercsates of IL-21. Therefore, the inclusion bodies must be disassociated and dissolved to isolate the [L-21 protein, and generally this requires the use o: a denaturing chaotropic solvent, resulting in recovering a polypeptide that must be refolded to have significant biological activity. Once the IL-2L protein is refolded, the protein must be captured and purified. Thus, the present invention provides for methods for isolating insoluble IL-21 protein from prokaryotic cells, dissolving the insoluble IL-21 protein material in a chaotropic solvent, diluting the chaotropic solvent in such a manner that the IL-21 protein is refolded and isolated. The present invention also includes methods for capturing the renatured IL-21 from the dilute refold buffer using cation exchange chromatography, and purifying the refolded IL-21 protein using hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Further purification is achieved using anion exchange in binding assays using an IL-21 receptor and the like.<br>
The human IL-21 gene encodes a polypeptide of 162 amino acids. The full length sequence includes a signal peptide of 29 amino acids, as shown in SEQ ID NOSil and 2, and a mature protein of 133 amino acids comprising residue 30 (Gin) to residue 162 (Ser). The IL-21 sequence as expressed using a prokaryotic expression system has an N-terminal Met, and the nucleotide and corresponding amino acid sequences are shown in SEQ ID NOS: 27 and 28. The nucleoside sequence of SEQ ID NO:2~ shows a codon optimized sequence that falls within the scope o\ the present inversion.<br><br>
Production of recombinant human IL-2I v.hieh utilized a mammalian expression system produced appro\::na;ely 20 mg/L of proiem. Therefore, a more cost effective expression system was desirable for large-scale p-vduction of I.L-2I. T:ic E. coii system was found to a he a ?ei:er alternative for large-scale production. One potential Asn-lmked glycosylation s:te :s present hut not occupied in protein expressed in a CHO cell line using a mammJnm expression system or in insect cells usme a bacu'oviral expression system. This structural feature makes LL-21 a good candidate for a prokaryotic expression. Expression m E. coli offers numerous advantages over other expression systems, particularly low dc elopment costs and high production vields.<br>
Recombinant IL-21 -.\i:h an N-terminal residue ;IL-21me:» expressed in E. c.'ii wa&gt; isolated as insoluble ine:us:on bodies after cell breakage. This material was incorrectly folded and did not possess the desired biological activity. In most cases inclusion bodies needed to be solubhzed in denaturing ehaotropic solvent and the protein refolded h\ dilution of the cha?tropic agent followed by purification. Proteins vary a great deal with respect to their optimal refolding environment. Factors that can affect the recover} of properly folded and biologically active material include: initial protein concentration, oxidatrve state. pH, excipients, salts, detergents, termperature, mode of refolding buffer addition arte ;he like. A protein with sequence and structure similarity to DL-21. IL-2, has been expressed in the E. coli system and refolded successfully (Weir et ah, J. Biochem. 245:85, 1987.) ALDESLEUKIN®, a recombinant mutein of human IL-2 has been expressed as inclusion bodies in the E. coli system and has been refolded in vitro.<br>
Examination of the codons used in the human EL-21 cDNA indicated that it contained an excess of the leas: frequently used codons in E. coli. Genes with a high content of rarely used codons tend to be expressed at a low level in E. coli (Kane, Curr Opin Biotechnol. 6(51:494-500. 1995). An additional concern relating to the expression of human IL-21 in E. cell was the occurrence of four potential OmpT cleavage sites located in the IL-21 sequence. OmpT is an endopeptidase that specifically cleaves between two consecutive basic residues and the enzyme is active under denaturing conditions such as SM urea and 6M guanidine-HCl (White et ah, J Biol Chem. 270(221:12990-4, 1995: Dekker et ah, Biochemistry, 40(61:1694-701, 2001). This raises concerns for the stability of 11-21 in a cell extract from E. coli due to the proteolytic activity of OmpT.<br>
Several laboratories have shown that the expression level of proteins whose genes contain rare codons can be dramatically improved when the level of certain rare tRNAs is increased \v;;hin the host (Zdano'. \\:y et ah. AppI Environ Mic-jhioi. 66(S):3 166-73, 2000; Calderone et aL J Mol B^h 262(4&gt;:407-12: Kleber-<br><br>

Co-expression with pRARE enhanced IL-21meL production in E. coli by about 5-10 fold. Co-expression with pRARE also decreased the le\e; of truncated lL-2I.met in E. coli cell lysate. suggesting mat re-synthesizing the EL-21 me: gene with more appropriate codons would be beneficial.<br>
The present invention provides an expression vector comprising the coding sequence of 11-21 with codons optimized for translation in E. coli. The synthetic gene encoding FL-2Imet was obtained by overlap PCR. The final PCR product was introduced into an expression vector for expression under the control of the Tac promotor. However, expression was low. An examination of the secondary structure of the IL-21met cDNA revealed an exceptionally stable hairpin structure. It was suspected that this hairpin loop was the structural element that prevented efficient expression from the fully optimized sequence. When the hairpin structure was eliminated by replacing the first eighty bases of the optimized sequence with the sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 1. The hybrid IL-21 is shown in SEQ ID NO: 2". and the resulting gene was expressed in E. coli at high levels. Expression levels with the ne-w expression construct increased to around 20% of total cell protein or 100 mg/L.<br>
Expression vectors that are suitable for production of a desired protein in prokaryotic cells typically comprise (1) prokaryotic DNA elements coding for a bacterial origin for the maintenance of the expression vector in a bacterial host; (2) DNA elements that control initiation of transcription, such as a promoter; (3) DNA elements that control the processing of transcripts, such as a transcriptional terminator, and 
Expression vectors can also comprise nucleotide sequences that encode a peptide tag to aid in purification of the desired protein. Peptide tags that are useful for isolating recombinant polypeptides include, for example, polyHistidine tags (which have an affinity for nickel-chelatins resin), c-mxc tags, calmodulin bmdimz protein i'iso_-.c;d with calmodulin affinity chromatography;, substance P, the RYIRS tag (whicU   .<br><br>

One oi' ordinary skill ir. the an will be familiar with a multitude of molecular techniques for the preparation of the expression veer:. For example, the IL-21 polynucleotide can be prepared by synthesizing nuclei: acid molecules using mutually priming, long oligonucleotides and the nucleotide sequences described herein (see. for example, Ausuhe!

Another method far constructing expression systems-- utilizes homologous recombination ustns; a veast svstem. See U.S. Patent No. 6.207.442, Plasmid Construction bv Homologous Recombination, incorporated herein bv reference. The system provides a universal acceptor plasmid that can re used to clone a DNA encoding any polypeptide of interest, including polypeptide fusions. The system provides methods for preparing double stranded, circular DNA molecules comprising a region encoding a protein of interest. One or more donor DNA fragments encoding the protein of interest, i.e., EL-2L, are combined with an acceptor plasmid. a first DNA linker, and a second DNA linker in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae host cell whereby the donor DNA fragment is joined to the acceptor plasmid by homologous recombination of the donor DNA, acceptor plasmid, and linkers to form the closed, circular plasmid.<br>
The nucleic acid molecules of the preserr. invention can also be synthesized with ""gene machines" using protocols such as the phosphoramidite method. If chemically-synthesized, double stranded DNA is required for an application such as the synthesis of a gene or a gene fragment, then each complementary strand is made separately. The production of short genes (60 to 80 base pairs; is technically straightforward and can be accomplished by synthesizing the complementary strands and then annealing them. For the production of longer genes (&gt;300 base pairs), hov.ever, special strategics may be required, because the c^pling efficiency of each c\cle during chemical DNA synthesis is seldom  bW7r. T: overcome this problem.<br><br>

A wide variety of selectable marker genes is available isee. for example. Kaufman, Meth. Enzvmol. 185:487 n9°0); Kaufman. Meth. Enzvmel. iRf:537 (1990n. It is common for expression vectors to comprise selection markers, such as tetracycline resistance, ampiicillin resistance, kar.amycin resistance, neomycin resistance, or chlormaphenicol resistance. A selectable marker will permit selection under detection of ceils that have been transformed with expression vector from cells that have not been transformed. An expression vector can carry more than one such antibiotic resistance nene. An example of selectable marker without antibiotic resistance uses the hbk/sok system from plasmid Rl. The /wfcigene encodes the toxic Hok protein of 52 amino acids and the sok gene- encodes an antisense RNA. which is complementary to the hok mRNA leader sequence. This selectable marker is known to one skilled in the ait and is described in more detail by Gerdes, K. e: al.. Genetic Engineering, 19:49-61. 1997.<br>

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. Cold Spring Harbor. NY. 1989, and AiMibei et aL eds.. Current Protocols in Molecular BioiQ'-v, John Wiley and Sons. Inc.. XY. 1987. Transformed or transfected host cells arc cultured according to conventional procedures in a cukure medium containing nutrients and other components required1 for the growth of the chosen host cells. A vane:y of suitable media, including defined media and complex media, are known in the art and generally include a carbon source, a nitrogen source, essential amino acids, vitamins and minerals. Media may also contain such components ns growth factors or serum, as required. The growth medium will senerallv select for cells containing the exoeenouslv added DXA by, for examrle, drus selection or deficiency in an essential nutrient that is complemented by the selectable marker carried on the expression vector or co-transfeeted into the host cell. Liquid cultures are provided with sufficient aeration by conventional means, such as shaking of small flasks or sparging of fermentors. Transformed cells can be selected and propagated to provide recombinant host cells that express the gene of interest. JDL-21 can be expressed in E. coli using the MBP (maltose binding protein) fusion system (Xew England Biolabs (NEB: Beverly, MA)). In this system, the IL-21 cDNA is attached to the 3' end of the malE gene to form an MBP-EL-21 fusion protein. Fusion protein expression is driven by the tac promoter and is "off" until the promoter is induced by addition of 1 mmol IPTG (isopropyl b-thiogalactosylpyranoside). The constructs can be built as in-frame fusions with MBP in accordance with the Multiple Cloning Site (MCS) of the pMAL-c2 vector (NEB), and according to the manufacturer's specifications.<br>

A carbohydrate solution is fed into the fermentor at a ore-determined rate starting at the beginning of the fermentation run. but generally after b hours elapsed fermentation time (EFT), and no longer ;han 12 hours EFT. Tne feed is continued until the end of the fermentation. The feed solution can be glycerol prepared at 40-70r; \7v or glucose prepared at 40-70c1 weightAoiume (w/v).

At the end of the fermentation run the temperature is adjusted downward to from 4° to 20°C, and the pH is either maintained or adjusted to 5.0 to 9.0. In certain embodiments, the range is 6.0 to 8.0 pH units. The fermentation broth is harvested by over-pressurization of the vessel and collection of the broth through the sample port. Alternatively, the broth can be pumped out through one ox the sample ports. The fermentation broth can contain IO'VC-JO^C w/v solids.<br>
EL-21 RECOVERY<br>
Following fermentation the cells are harvested by centnfugation. re-suspended in homogenization buffer and homogenized, for example, in an APV-Gaulin homogenizer (Invensys APV, Tonawanda, New York) or other type of cell disruption equipment, such as bead mills and sonicators. Alternatively, the cells are taken directly from the fermentor and homogenized in an APV-Gaulin homogenizer. Alternatively, the fermentation broth may be diluted with water or buffer prior to homogenization.<br>
In one embodiment, the cells are homogenized directly in the fermentation broth. For example, an APV-Gaulin 1000 or APV-Gaulin 2000 homogenizer is chilled to 4°-15°C for at least 30 minutes. The fermentation broth is passed through the homogenizer and the cell suspension is collected. The homogenizer pressure should be set at 6000 to 14.000 psi for maximum cell disruption. In one embodiment, the pressure is set for 10.000 psi. The suspension is passed through the homogenizer between 1-5 times, for example, for 3 passes. Ir. another embodiment, the broth is diluted with an equal volume oi water prior to homogenization. The amount of DNA may be decreased by the addition of PEL spermine or benzonase during or after the homogenization step.<br><br>
The homogenate is centr.fuged, and the pellet containing the inclusion bodies :s obtained after decanting the supernatant. The inclusion body pelle: :s washed in water, or Tris buffers uith or without varying levels uf the following . mpounds: sodium chloride, urea, Triton X-lQo. znv chloride, sodium iauryl sulfate, sucrose.<br>
In another embodiment, the cells are harvested by transferrins the fermentation broth to centrifuge bottles and centrifuging a: 2-8°C for 2O-&gt;0 minutes. For example, a Beckman J6MI centrifuge with KompSpin KAJ7.100 rotor Beckman Coulter. Fullenon. CA) at 7500 x G car. be used to harvest cells. A Beckman Avanti JTIC centrifuge with a Beckman JLA-S.l fixed angle rotor «-S,000 -15.S00 \ G) or an Aries .IS 5.0 Swinging Bucket rotor with 2.25 L bottles at 7500 X G can be used as well. A continuous centrifuge such as those supplied by Carr Separations. Inc. (Franklin, MA) or Westfalia Separator. Inc. (Northvale, NJ,; can also be used.<br>
The culture broth or supernatant is removed from the centrifuge bottles. The cell pellets are rcsuspended in homogenization buffer (TOO mM Tris. 5 mM ZnCN, pH 7.5) at 10-30^ w/v solids. The fermentation broth is passed through the APV-Gaulin homogenizer and the cell suspension is collected. The homogenizer pressure should be set at 6000-14,000 psi for maximum cell disruption. In one embodiment, the pressure is 10.000 psi. The suspension is passed-through the homogenizer for 1-5 passes, for example, 3 passes.<br>
Additionally, the methods of recovering IL-21 can comprise a further step of precipitating, washing, and resolubilizing the EL-21. The washed inclusion bodies are solubilized in 6 M guanidine or 8 M urea, diluted 6-10 fold in water or buffer, incubated 30 minutes, and centrifuged or filtered. Alternatively, ultrafiltration or macrofiltration can be used wash inclusion bodies after homogenization. The resulting precipitate is washed in 2-6 M urea, and contains the IL-21 protein. The precipatate is then washed with water prior to solublization. Addition of A1J~ or Fe^ or anionic and cationic polymers or agents such as spermine, PEI and benzonase may be added to precipitate cell debris, soluble proteins, DNA, RNA. and carbohydrates.<br>
SOLUBILIZATION OF INCLUSION BODIES<br>
The washed inclusion body prep can be solubilized using guanidine hydrochloride (5-8 M), guanidine thioGyanate (5-6 M), or urea (7-8 M) containing a reducing agent such as beta mercaptoethanol (10 - 100 mM), or dithiothreitol (5-50 mM,j. The solutions can be prepared in Tris, phopshate, HEPES or other appropriate buffers. Inclusion bodies can also be solubilized with urea '2-4 M) containing sodium laury! .sulfate (0.1-2%). Inclusion bodies from 1 liter of fermentation broth can be soh;^:::zcd usin2 50 - 200 ml of the described solutions. The one method provides<br><br>
solubilizing the inclusion bod&gt; pellets from 1 titer of fermentation broth in 150 ml of 6 M GuHCl prepared in 100 mM Tns. pH 8.0. containing 40 m\I DTT. In another embodiment, an inclusion body slurry is mixed with 50-100 mi 8 M GuHCL. The slurry is re-suspended by mixing with a spatula followed b\ hornoger.ization with an Omni EZ homosenizer (Omni International, WaiTenton. VAt or mix me with a mechanical device. The suspension is mixed for 30 - 120 minutes, a: 3-37"C. In one embodiment, the suspension is mixed at 15-25'C, to finish the solubilization process. The &gt;amplc is then centrifuged at 7.500 - 16.000 x G at 4°C for 10 -30 minutes using an appropriate centrifuge. The supernatant sample containing the solubilized IL-21 is decanted and retained.<br>
The concentration of the IL-21 in the solubilized fraction is determined by reversed phase HPLC. A Jupiter C5 column (Phenomenex. Torrance. CA) is used with acetonitriie/trifluoroacetic acid as the mobile phase. IL-21 standard is diluted in a guanidine/DTT/Tris-containing buffer and different amounts are injected onto the column. The area under the IL-21 peak is used to construct a standard curve. The solubilized IL-21 sample is microfuged to remove particulates prior to injection on the HPLC column. Determination of the area under the IL-21 peak allows quantification of the IL-21 concentration from the standard curve.<br>
Additionally, the solubilized IL-21 may be purified at this stage using tangential flow filtration, reverse phase HPLC of immobilized metal affinity chromatography.<br>

The inclusion bodies are then solubilized and denatured in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride containing a reducing agent. The reduced IL-21 is then oxidized in a controlled renaturation step. This step involves dilution in a refold buffer containing arginine hydrochloride, salts, and an oxido-shuffling system. The oxido-shuffling system is used to initiate disulfide bonding of the IL-21 molecule, and is based on mixtures of reduced and oxidized molecules such as cysteine and cystine, DTT and cystine, reduced glutathione and oxidized glutathione, and DTT and oxidized glutathione. The ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione can range from 1:1 to 6:1 with a concentration ranee of 0.5 and 8 m\I. In one embodiment, the optimal concentration is 4 rriM reduced glutathione: 2 mM oxidized glutathione.   The ratio of cysteine to<br><br>
cystine can ran^-;- from 2:1 to 1:J with a concentration range c:4 mM to 1 mM of either reagent. In one embodiment, the optim J concentration is 4 mM cysteine, with 2 mM cystme. Optimal refolding may also be achieved using 4 mM cystine and 2 mM DTT which form 4 n\l cysteine and 2 mM cystine. Refolding may also be done bv sulfitolysis in the presence of reagents such as sodium sulfite and sodium tetrathionate. The renaturec fL-2: is captured from the dilute refold buffer using cation exchange chroma:ography. and is purified using hydrophobic intera::ion chromatography and high performance cation exchange chromatography.<br>
The solute containing 1L-21 is added rapidly -1-5 minutes), or slowly (0.5-5 hours) to the refolding buffer with mixing. The refolding buffer contains ami nine (0.5 to 1.25 Mi. PEG, and salts. It may also include glycerol, guanidine HCI, urea. EDTA. protease inhibitors and chaperones, alcohol, detergents, glycerol and copper sulfate. The IL-21 can be added in one addition, in multiple additions, or fed in over time. The IL-21 is added to the refolding mixture to a final concentration of 0.05 to 1.2 mg/ml. The temperature range is 4-30'C. The pH is 7.3 to S.5. The vessel containing the refold mixture is left open to the atmosphere or can be sparged with air or nitrogen during renaturaiion. The refolding is allowed to take place 1 :o 26 hours.<br>
Refolding can also be done in the presence of EDTA to decrease methionine oxidation, or on a size exclusion column, or usine tangential flow filtration, orelecirodialysis.<br>
CLARIFICATION AND CONCENTRATION OF REFOLDED IL-21<br>
Refolded IL-21 is adjusted to pH 5.5 and then passed through a 1.2 \xm filter for clarification and removal of insoluble protein. The filtered solution is concentrated 10-30 fold using tangential flow filtration on a plate and frame system or with a hollow fiber cartridge. The concentrate is then diluted 3-10 fold with buffer or water to allow unfolded and aggregated proteins to precipitate. The solution is then passed through a filter for clarification and removal of insoluble protein.<br>
Alternatively, the refolded IL-21 is diluted 2-fold to 10-fold in water or<br>
25 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5. A precipitate or flccculant forms and, after<br>
approximately 30 minutes to five hours, is removed by filtration. A 1.2 \im nominal<br>
filter followed by a 0.45 jam nominal filter, or a depth filter with a positive zeta<br>
potential, can be used to remove the flocculant. It would be possible to use other filters<br>
such   as  a graded  density filter.	It is  also possible to  use centrifugation  or<br>
micro filtration to remove the flocculant.<br><br>
CAPTURE OF IL-21<br>
In another aspect of the present invention. ^fter the IL-21 protein is refolded and concentrated, the methods of the present invento n compr.se capturing the refolded [L-21 protein is captured in di'.ute buffer on a ca::vn exchange column and purihmg IL-21 protein using hydrophobic interaction chromatography and high performance cation exchange chromatography.<br>
The capture step is designed to capture the diluted, folded LL-21 and earn out inmal purification. In order for TL-21 to bind to the column a dilution is first earned out. The clarified, diluted IL-21 is captured on a car: ;n exchange column at pH 5.5. Typically, SP Sepharosc XL , Amersham Biosciences, Pi&gt;catawa\, NJ) or TOVOPEARL SP 550C (Tosoh Biosep. .Montgomery. PAi is used. The equilibration buffer is 25 niM sodium acetate. 0.2 to 0.45 M sodium chlor.de. pH 5.5, and the bound [L-21 is eluted with an increasing salt gradient. IL-21 elute&gt; rroTrTthe SP Sepharose XL at approximately 0.6 M sodium chloride and from the TOVOPEARL SP 550C at approximate!}'0.8 M sodium chloride.<br>
Expanded bed chromatography can also be used \ov [L-21 capture following refolding. In that case the dilution step is carried out in-line while loading the EL-21 onto the column. Streamline SP XL (Amersham Biosciences) is equilibrated with 25 mM sodium acetate, 0.2 M NaCl. pH 5.5. EL-21 is then loaded in upflow mode onto the equilibrated Streamline SP XL resin, which is maintained at twice the settled bed height, while diluting 1:3 inline with water. Following washing in both upflow and downflow modes, EL-21 is eluted in downflow mode with a 0.6 M NaCl step or a NaCl gradient.<br>
The methods of the present .invention provide the use of many different cation exchange resins for this step, including weak croon exchangers such as carbcxymethyl, different types of solid supports such as agarose or cellulose, and different particle sizes. The methods of the present invention can also provide running the columns at different pHs in the range from 5.0 to 7.0, ana with different buffers and salts. Alternatively, other chromatographic methods such as hydrophobic interaction, anion exchange, and metal chelate maybe used to capture the refolded EL-21.<br>
PURIFICATION<br>
In one aspect of the present invention, there is an intermediate purification of IL-21 protein. This step is designed to achieve further purification of the IL-21 using hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Typ::ally Butyl Sepharose FF (Amersham Biosciences) or TOVOPEARL butyl 650M (To. m Biu-ep) are resins used for mis step.   The resin is equilibrated with 25 mM sodium acetate. 50 mM NaCl. 1.5<br><br>
M (N"Ri)2-S0i, pH 5.5. IL-21 that has been purified by canon exchange chromutogrannx is adjusted to 1.5 VI 'NI-Li^SO; and then passed through a 0.45 um nominal filter. The adjusted and filtered EL-2L is then loaded onLo the equilibrated resin, which is then washed with, equilibration buffer to remove unbound materia!. LL-21 is eluted with a gradient to 25 mM sodium acetate. 50 nM NaCL pH 5.5. IL-21 elute&gt; from the column at approximately 0.75 M (M-LhSC^ to 0.3 M (NPL'iSOa.<br>
Other hydrophobic interaction chromatography resins that can be used for this step include, for example, those substituted with phenyl or hexvl. different ivpes o\' solid supports such as agarose or ceiiulose. and different particle sizes. The present invention also provides running the coiumns at different pHs in the range from 5.0 to 9.0. and with different buffers and salts. The present invention also provides running the column in such a manner that IL-21 does not bind.<br>
The IL-21 is futher purified by high performance cation exchange chromatography. Tvnicallv. the IL-2I is diluted to a conductivity o( 30 ms/em, adjusted to pH 6.0 with 0.5 M dibasic phosphate and loaded onto a column of Sepharose SP HP (Amersham Bioscienccs). The column is equilibrated with 25 mM sodium phosphate, 0.3 M sodium chloride, pH 6.0. It is washed with equilibration buffer and then EL-21 is eluted with a sodium chloride gradient. The present invention also provides using othe^ high performance cation exchange resins. The columns can be run at different pH values in the range from 5.0 to 7.5 with different buffers, such as phosphate. The load material can be diluted with water or buffer to conductivity values in the range from 5 to 35 ms/cm.<br>
The methods for purifying IL-21 can comprise concentrating and carrying out a buffer exchange of the protein. This step is designed to concentrate the high performance cation exchange column eluate and exchange it into formulation buffer. The final column eluate pool is concentrated approximately 10 fold using a 5 kDa molecular weight cut-off tangential flow filtration plate and frame membrane, diafiltered against phosphate buffered saline, pH 6.0, or against 10 mM histidine, 4.72'c (w/v) mannitol, pH 5.0, 5.1, 5.2 or 5.3, then concentrated a second time to further increase the concentration of IL-21.<br>
Other membranes can be used, such as a 3 kDa or 8 kDa molecular weight cut-off plate and frame membrane or a 10 kDa molecular weight cut-off hollow fiber system to achieve this ultrafi 11ration/cliafi 1 tration step. The purity of the IL-21 following high performance cation exchange chromatography is at least 95%, and typically greater than 98%, by sodium dodecyl suifate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The endotoxin le\el in the IL-21 prrparation following cation exchange     chromatography     capture,  . hydrophobic     ir/.-jra- .ion     chromatography<br><br>

Further purification of IL-21 to remove the remaining impurities and contaminants may be desirable. For example, an anion exchange column can be used to reduce- the endotoxin level. IL-21 is" diluted to a conductivity level oi^ 
Other purification steps that could potentially be used to further purify EL-21 include metal chelate chromatography, anion exchange chromatography, or hydrophobic interaction chromatography on a phenyl column. It is also possible to carry out purification prior to refolding the IL-21, using for example reversed phase HPLC. ion exchange chromatography or metal chelate chromatography. Thus, the present invention further provides methods comprising the additional steps of purification disclosed herein.<br>
CHARACTERIZATION OF PURIFIED DL-21<br>
BaF3 is an interleukin-3 TL-3) dependent pre-lymphoid cell line derived from murine bone-marrow (Palacios and Steinmetz, Cell 4L 727-734, 1985; Mathey-Prev;: et aL Mol. Cell. Biol. 6: 4133-4135, 1986). BaF3 cells expressing the full-lengm 11-21 receptor have been constructed as described fully in U.S. Patent No.6.307,024. This cell line that is dependent on the IL-21 receptor-linked pathway for survo-al, and culturin? the cell line in the absence of other smv.:.rh factors can be used to assa;-  for biologically active IL-21.    Proliferation of the BaF3/IL-21R cells can be<br><br>
assessed by using various dilutions of purified IL-21 protem which are added to the cells and comparing growth of the treated cells to growth of cells grpv. n in the absence o\ IL-21 protein.<br>
Assays measuring cell proliferation or differentiation are well known in the ant. For example, assays measuring proliferation include such assays as chemosensitivity to neutral red d&gt;e iCavanaugh et aL Investigational New Drucs 8:347-354, 1090, incorporated herein by reference), incorporation of radiolabeled nucleotides (Cook et ah. Analytical Biochem. 179:1-7, 19^. incorporated herein bv reference), meoiporation of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridme iBrdU.) in the DNA of proliferating cells (Porstmann et ah. J. Immunol. Metnods S2:169-179, 1955, incorporated herein by reference), and u-e of tetrazolium salts (Mosmann. J. Immunol. Methods 65:55-63. 1983; Alley et aL. Cancer Res. 48:589-601, 19SS: Marshall et ah. Growth Reg. 5:69-84, 1995; and Scudiero et al.. Cancer Res. 48:482^-4833. 1988: all incorporated herein by reference). Assays measuring differentiation include, for example, meastiring cell-surface markers associated with stage-speciric expression o\ a tissue, enzymatic activity, functionaf activity or morphological changes (Watt, FASEB, 5:281-284, 1991; Francis. Differentiation 57:63-75. 1994; R-s. Adv. Anim. Cell Biol. Technol. Bioprocesses, 161-171. 1989; all incorporated herein by reference). IL-21 produced by the methods described herein is capable of stimulating proliferation of BaF3/IL-21R cells.<br>
Purified IL-21 can be characterized by a number of physical methods. Optimally, amino acid analysis indicates the amino acid composition of all residues is within 10% of the expected values. N-termmal sequencing gives a single sequence beginning with methionine and corresponding to the sequence predicted from the IL-21 expression vector. Whole mass analysis using mass spectrometry gives a value within 0.01 % of the predicted mass of IL-21 (15593.84 Da). Endoproteinase Lys C digestion followed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry can be used to generate a peptide map in which all peaks correspond in mass to predicted tryptic peptides in EL-21, and in which all predicted tryptic peptides from EL-21 are identified. Peptide mapping also indicates disulfide bonding consistent with that predicted for a protein that is a member of the EL-2 family, as well as an absence of methionine oxidation<br>
FORMULATION<br>
The pH was selected to minimize degradation observed by SE-HPLC (soluble dimer formation, content loss), CIE-HPLC (apparent deamidation), and RP-HPLC (oxidation and degradation by pathways yet to be identified). In certain embodiments, the range of pH is 5.0-5.6 using, a histidmc buffer based on buffer<br><br>
capacity, sta^mty. and parenteral administration compatibility. Alternatively, citrate or succinate buffers mav be used. In one embodimeut. manniio! was selected as a tonicitv adjuster (is., tonic solution) on . the basis of stability, and compatibility with lyophilizatior.. In other embodiments, sorbitol or glycine can be used. NaCI can be used. but. m:.;. be less stable. Trehalose or sucrose can be used, but may potentially hydrolize under these slightly acidic conditions. However, formulations may include how J mg/ml to 100 mg/ml IL-21 in the formulation. In one embodiment, EL-21 pre:cin is formulated at a concentration of 10 ir.g/mL IL-21 in 10 rr.M histidine, 4.7% w/\ manniiol. pH 5.3. The product was stored frozen a; -20C. Determination of whether a solution product is viable depends on the specification limits which are deemed acceptable, and those skilled in the an will define limits to maximize product recovery, minimize aggregation, minimize charge heterogeneity, minimize impurities and maintain acceptable biological activity. When limits of cJ0r" purity by CIE- and RP-H.PLC. and &gt; 90% label claim of content were set. a refrigerated solution product was stable and considered a reasonable alternative. Doses o( IL-21 between 0.1 to 3 mg/kg will generally not exceed 30 ml for IV bolus delivery.<br>
.A lyophilized product can also be prepared and would fall wnth the scope of the present invention. Other excipients may also be included in the compositions of the present invention. For example, acceptable excipients include disaceharides, such as trehalose and sucrose at 0.5% to 10% as stabilizers; polyethylene glycol at 0.001% to 0.1% as a stablizer or wetting agent; surfactants, such as tueen 20. tween 80 or triton-X-100 at 0.001% to 0.1% as a stablizer or wetting agent; or other bulking agents, such as glycine, hydroxyethyl starch in the range of 0.5% to 5%.<br>
Stability studies may be done under accelerated conditions such as storage at elevated temperature of 25°C to 45°C or agitation.. For example, multiple freeze-thaw cvcles were done, with the IL-21 formulation shown to be stable at concentrations of 20 mg/ml. In one embodiment, pH 5.25 is used to reduce rates of degradation. However, an optimal pH range for lypholized product is 4.75 to 7.5, with non-lyophilized products in the pH range of 5 to 5.6.<br>
One or more preservatives may also be included in the compositions of the present invention, particularly in those compositions*packaged for multiple use. Preservatives that can be used within the present invention include those commonly used in pharmaceutical preparations, such as methylparabem propylparaben, benzyl alcohol, m-cresol, ethylmercurithiosalycilate, phenol, thimerosaL and the like.<br>
IL-21 compositions intended for pharmaceutical use will be sterile and pvrogen-free.   and   will    be. manufactured   and   packaged   according   to   accepted<br><br>
pharmaceutical procedures. The compositions can be packaged in unit dosaee or multiple dosage quantities. The compositions will typically be packaged in sealed glass via!&gt; with polytetrafluoroetylene-lineJ stoppers and with appropriate labeling. Lynphilizcd compositions may be packaged as a kit that includes an appropriate' quantity of a suitable diluent, such as water for injection f\VFI» or 5r"( dextrose in Vv'Fl.<br>
The   invention   is   further   illustrated   by   the   following   non-limiting examples.<br>

Example 1<br>

Construction of expression vector, pTAP237<br>
Plasmid pTAP237 was generated by inserting a PCR-generated linker into the Smal site of pTAP186 by homologous recombination. Plasmid pTAPl86 was derived from the plasmids pRS316 (a Saccharomyces cerevisiae shuttle vector) and pMAL-c2, an E. coli expression plasmid derived from pKK_23-3 and comprising the tac promoter and the rrnB terminator.. Plasmid pTAP!S6 contains a kanamycin resistance eene irv-which the Sma I site has been destroved and has NotI and Sfil sites flanking the yeast ARS-CEN6 and URA3 sequences, facilitating their removal from the plasmid by digestion with NotI. The PCR-generated linker replaced the expression coupler sequence in pTAP186 with the synthetic RBS II sequence. It was prepared from 100 pmoles each of oligonucleotides zc29,740 and zc29.741, as shown in SEQ ID NOS: 3 and 4, respectively, and approximately 5 pmoles each of oligonucleotides zc29,736 and zc29,738. as shown in SEQ ID NOS: 5 and 6, respectively. These oligonucleotides were combined by PCR for ten cycles of 94°C for 30 seconds. 50°C for 30 seconds, and 72°C for 30 seconds, followed by 4°C soak. The resulting PCR products were concentrated by precipitation with two times the volume of 100% ethanol. Pellet was resuspended in 10 uL water to be used for recombining into the recipient vector pTAP186 digested with Smal to produce the construct containing the synthetic RBS II sequence. Approximately 1 /xg of the PCR-generated linker and 100 ng of pTAP186 digested with Smal were mixed together and transformed into competent yeast cells (5. cerevisiae). The yeast was then plated onto -URA D plates and left at room temperature for about 72 hours. Then the Ura-f transformants from a single plate were resuspended in 1 mL FLO and spun briefly to pellet the yeast cells. The cell pellet was resuspended in 0.5 mL of lysis buffer. DNA was recovered and transformed into E. coli MCI061. Clones were screened by colony PCR as disclosed above using 20 pmoles each of oligonucleotides zc29,740 and zc29,74L as shown in SEQ ID NOS:<br><br>
3 and 4. respectively.   Clones displaying the correct size hand on an agarose gel were subject to sequence analysis. The correct plasmid was designated pTAP237.<br>
Example 2<br>
Construction o\ pTAP252<br>
The human IL-21 coding sequence (as shown in SEQ FD NO: I) was generated by PCR amplification using a CD3-f cDNA library pool as template and oligonucleotide primers zc29.0S4 and zc22,127 (SEQ ED NOS: 7 and S, respecti\eiv). To optimize the translation process in E. coli, primer zc2LU.,S4 i'SEQ ID NO:7i added an ATG initiation codon to the 5* end of the IL-21 coding sequence. The resulting gene sequence encoded the mature IL-21 with one extra methionine at the N-terminus TL-21 met'). The final PCR product was inserted into expression vector pTAP237 (described in Example 1) by yeas! "homologous recombination (Raymond et al.. Biotechniques. 26(1):134-S. 140-1. 1999; U.S. Patent 6.02T442, incorporated herein by reference). The expression construct. pTAP252. was extracted from yeast and transformed into competent E. coli MC1061. Kanamycin resistant clones were identified by colony PCR. A positive clone was verified by sequencing and subsequently transformed into either production host strain E104 or UT5600.<br>
Example 3<br>
Codon Optimization<br>
Induction of expression of human IL-21 met from pTAP252 produced about 2 - 5% of total cellular protein in E. coli strain E104. Examination of the codons used in the IL-21 coding sequence indicated that it contained an excess of the least frequently used codons in E. coli with a CAI value equal to 0.181. The CAI is a statistical measure of synonymous codon bias and can be used to predict the level of protein production (Sharp et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 15^3): 1281-95. 1987). Genes coding for highly expressed proteins tend to have high CAI values (&gt; 0.6). while proteins encoded by genes with low CAI values (:494-500, 1995).<br>
It has been shown that the expression level of proteins whose genes contain rare codons can be dramatically improved when the level of certain rare tRNAs is increased within the host (Zdanovsky et al., ibid.. 2000: CJderoric et al., ibid.. 1996; Klehjrdanke et al., ibid., 2000; You et al,. ibid.. 1999). The pRAFiL.plasmid carries<br><br>
genes encoding the tRNAs Tor several codons that are rareh used E. c:; iargU. arcW, leuW . proL. iieX and glyTi. The genes are under the contr;! of their native promoters (N:zing the gene coding tor IL-21 met with more appropriate codon usage provides an improved vector for expression or large amounts of [L-21.<br>
The codon optimized IL-21 met coding sequence was constructed from sixteen overiapmg oligonucleotides: zc22.913 I'SEQ ID NO:9). zc22.914 iSEQ ID NO: 10), zc22.915 (SEQ ID NO:M), zc22,916 iSEQ ID NO:12), zc22.96l (SEQ ID NO:13), ze22%2 (SEQ ID NO:14). ze22,963 (SEQ ID NO:15). ze22.%4 (SEQ ID NO:16), zc22.965 (SEQ ID NO:17j. zc22.966 <seq id notsh zc22.96s no:20 zc22>)o(&gt; (SEQ ID NO:2I). zc22,967 (SEQ ID NOT9V zc22.970 (SEQ ID NO:22). zc22/r 1 (SEQ ID NO:23), and zc22,9^2 (SEQ ID NO:24). Primer extension of these overlapping oligonucleotides followed by PCR amplication produced a full length IL-21 met gene with codons optimized for expression in E. col.. The final PCR product was inserted into expression vector pT-AP165 by yeas; homologous recombination. The expression construct was extracted from^east and transformed into comnetent E. coli MC1061. Clones resistance to kanamvcin were identified bv colonv PCR. A positive clone was verified by sequencing and subsequently transformed into either production host strain E104 or UT5600. The expression vector with the optimized EL-21met sequence was named pTAP196. The final PCR product was introduced into vector pTAP168 for expression under the control of Tac promotor. However, the expression was very low and the product could only be detected by Western analysis using monoclonal antibodies directed against DL-21 as the probe.<br>
Examination of the secondary structure of the IL-21 met message revealed an exceptionally stable hairpin structure in the region between bases 36 and 64 (SEQ ID NOT). It was suspected that this structural element prevented efficient translation from the DL-21 met message. Therefore, a hybrid IL-21 met coding sequence was generated by overlap PCR. A fragment containing the first eighty bases of the non-optimized IL-21 met sequence was generated by PCR amplification using pTAP252 as template and oligonucleotide primers zc29,740 (SEQ ID NO:3) and zc40,133 (SEQ ID NO:25). The optimized region of EL-21met from base 81 to 450 (SEQ ID NO:27) was generated by PCR amplification using pTAP196 as template and oligonucleotide primers zc22,971 (SEQ ID NO:23) and zc40,107 (SEQ ID NO:26). These two PCR products were combined and amplified using oligonucleotide primers zc22,971 (SEQ ID NO:23) and_zc29,740 (SEQ ID NO:3) to generate full i-ngth IL-21 met by overlap<br><br>
PCK. The final PCR product was inserted into expression vector pTA?23T by veast homologous recombination. The expression construct wa&gt; extract:,: ;r un yeast and transformed into competent E. coli MC1061. Clones iv&gt;&gt;tani u- L.namycin were identified by colony PCR. A positive clone was verCied b\ sequencing and subsequently transformed into either production host stive- El 04 y- LT56O0. The expression vector with the hybrid IL-21met coding sequence v. as named pTAP337.<br>
Once the hairpin structure was eliminated b;- replacing :ne first eightv ba&gt;e- of the optimized sequence with the first eighty nucleov.dcs of me non-optimized IL-21met sequence (shown in SEQ ID NO:lj, the resulting gene v.as expressed ver\ well in E. coli. Expression levels with the new construct increased to around 20Cc of total cell protein.<br>
Example 4 Expression of LL-21mct<br>
E. coli were inoculated into 100 mL Supermoth II medium (Becton Dickinson. Franklin Lakes. NJ) containing 0-01rr Antifoam 2S9 iSigma-Aldrich. St. - Louis, MO) and 30 fxg/ml kanamycin. and cultured overnight at 3" C. A 10 mL inoculum was added to 500 mL of same medium in a 2 L culture flask that was shaken at 2~5 rpm at 37°C until the culture attained an OD600 of 4. IPTG was then added to a final concentration of L mM and shaking was continued for another 2.5 hours. The cells were centrifuged at 4,000 x g for 10 min at 4°C. The cell pellets were frozen at -S0°C for use at a later time.<br>
Expression of EL-21met was performed on a larger scale in a 25 mL culture at 37°C. One mL of culture was collected 2 hours after [PTG induction. E. coli cells were resuspended in an equal volume BugBuster® Protein Extraction Reagent (Novagen, Madison, WI) at 4°C and incubated for 20 min. The soluble and insoluble fractions were separated by centrifugation at 16,000 x g for 10 min at 4 C.<br>
Recombinant EL-21met accumulated as insoluble inclusion bodies. The recovery yield of EL-21met from most of the E, coli strains v. as considered low. About 80 to 90% of IL-21met in the inclusion bodies was lost wi-.hin 20 min after cell lysis and incubation at 4°C. Lysing bacteria with 8 M urea c:d not improve recovery. However, including protease inhibitors, such as 5 mM ZnCL and 0.5 mM Benzamidine, in the cell lysis buffer prevented the loss of IL-21met ::;m strain E104 (W3110 arabmose"). This indicated that a bacterial protease capable c: cleaving IL-21met under denaturing conditions was co-purifying with the inclusion b: aies. It was observed that [L-2!mct was stable in cells lysates from strain LT5600, b.e. not in E104 cell lysates. This suggested that the protease was present in El04 but n /. CT5600. Comparison o^<br><br>
the genot\pes of these strains revealed that OmpT, which cleave- between dibasic residues, was present in E104 but not m 1T5600. OmpT N heat staple and active even under denaturing conditions (White e: ah, ibid. ICK&gt;5). Examination of the amino acid sequence of IL-21 indicated thai it contained a: least four potential OmpT cleavase sites. IL-21 met also demonstrated excellent stahiiiry in BL2 1. another OmpT deficient E. C'-'Ii strain. These data suggested that OmpT protease activity was critical for the stability and recovery of IL-21. The use of E. coli strain UT5600 as the production host significantly improves the recovery of IL-21 met. Overall the yields of IL-21met were increased from 2 mg/L to 50-100 mg'L with the combination of construct and host strain improvement.<br>
Example 5 Characterization of IL-21<br>
For Western analysis, protein samples were separated on a 4-209.1 MES-SDS NuPAGE gel (Invitrogenj under reducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Invitrogen) at 30 V for 1 hour. The membrane was blocked with 5(Tc non-fat milk in TTBS buffer 
Example 6<br>
Plasmid Stability Analysis<br>
E. coli was inoculated into 25 mL Superbroth II medium (Becton Dickinson) containing 0.01% Antifoam 289 (Sigma) and 30 jig/ml kanamycin. and cultured overnight at 37°C. A 25 |uL inoculum was added to 25 mL of same medium without kanamycin in a 25 mL culture flask which was shaken at 275 rpm at 37°C. 100 j-tL of culture were collected at four different time points 'when the culture reached OD600 values of 2, 4, 6 and 8). The samples were diluted and plated on LB agar plates without any additives. After overnight incubation at 37°C. 100 E. coli colonies were replica plated onto a LB agar plate and a LB agar plate containing 30 ug/ml kanamycin. After overnight incubation at 37°C, the number of colonies that formed on each plate was counted and compared. The number of colonies that grew on LB plus kanamycin relative to the number that erew on the plate without antibiotic reflected the percentage of CJIL still harboring the expression \ actor.<br><br>
V\ nen clones of W31 10 carrying the pTAP337 expression vector were cukared lor 12 hours in medium that did not contain kanamycin. more than 90% reined the plasmid. Clones carrying the expression vector without the IL-21 Ljene shov-.cd similar retention of the plasmid. These data demonstrate thai the pTAP337 expression vector carrying IL-21 is stable in W3110.<br>
E. coli strains. TGI and MM294. were not selected as the production hos: due to low productivity of IL-21 and serious plasmid instabilirv. The most enc, uraging results came from the studies using E. coli strain W3110 (ATCC #27325) to produce IL-21. The productivity o( W3110 was comparable to tha: of UT5600. Pi;&gt;:nid stability studies demonstrated that the expression vector. pTAP337. was mamtained in VV3110 as well. UT5600 is an auxotrophic strain and more difficult to grov. at large scale. These considerations led to selection of W3110 as [he preferred ho&gt;: strain for production of IL-21.<br>

Example 12<br>
A.        Clarification of refolded IL-21<br>
This step is to stop the refolding reaction and to remove particulates from the refolded IL-21 solution. Refolded IL-21 is typically adjusted to pH 5.5 and then passed through a 1.2 jam nominal filter. In some cases the pH is not adjusted prior to the filtration, and in other cases a different size (0.45 - 2.0 urn) or type of filter could be used. It is possible to remove the particulates by cemrifugation. using a Carr powerfuge continuous centrifuge (Carr Separations, Inc.. Franklin. MA) or by centrifugation in bottles.<br>
After refolding, the conductivity of the buffer solution needs to be reduced for loading onto the SP550 C capture resin. The cloudy solution also needs to be filtered to remove unfolded IL21 and precipitated E. coll proteins. In one example, 29.5 L of refolded buffer containing refolded IL-21 was diluted with 1.4 parts ( 42.0 L) of 25 mM acetate buffer pH 5.5. The solution was allowed to precipitate at room temperature for 4 hours . The solution was then filtered through a 1.2 -0.8 urn Cuno Zeta Plus depth filter.<br><br>
B.        Dilution and clarification of refolded EL-21<br>
This step is to stop the refolding reaction, dilute the refolded material to enable binding to cation exchange chromatography, and to remove particulates from the refolded IL-21 solution. Refolded IL-21 is typically adjusted to pH 5.5. and then diluted 1.4 fold with 25 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5. This solution is allowed to settle for approximate!} four hours at room temperature with a view to enhance physical separation of soluble and insoluble proteins present in the diluted refold solution. The settled and diluted refold solution mostly devoid Qt particulates is then typically passed through a l.ZtoO.S |_im depth filter (Cur.o Zeta Plus A30M03).<br>

A Mi'.upore 1.2 urn Polypro XL filter (Millpore) is followed by a 0.45 |am Whatman Polycap ~5 AS filter (Maidstone, Kent. UK). The filtered IL-21 is loaded.onto a column of Amersham Bioseiences SP Sepharose XL resin equilibrated to equilibration buffer t^25 mM sodium acetate, 0.2 M NaCl, pH 5.5).

OmpT deficient strain for expressing EL-21<br>
A.        Construction of a new host strain for production of EL-21<br>
The current process for production of IL-21 includes expression in the E.coli host W3110 [F- mcrA mcrB IN(rrnD- rrnE) 1 A.-]. While W3110 is a robust host for production of EL-21, it is not ideal for downstream processing. Upon cell lysis. IL-21 is cleaved at lysine 74 (as shown in SEQ DD NO:28) by the OmpT protease present in the outer membrane. This protease is known to cleave other heterologous recombinant proteins, including FGF-18. Proteolysis of EL-21 does not occur in strains lacking OmpT; such as BL21 [F- ompT hsdSB (rB- mB-) gal dcm Ion]. While OmpT activity can be minimized during cell lysis with the addition of ZnSOj, or CuS04, the purification scheme had to be designed to remove truncated IL-21 from the final product. In an effort to streamline the process for production of EL-21. the OmpT protease was removed from W3110 to create a new production strain. The construction of this new E.coli host strain is described below.<br><br>
B.	Construction of plusmid pCHANl kn expression of the Red recombinase<br>
operon<br>
A s;rategy based on homologous recombination was used to :-em;-.e the OmpT protease from W3I10. In order to delete genes efficiently fro— the E.j-.^: chromosome by homolcgous recombinantion. certain enzymes with recombinase ac;v. itv must be present wrdun the ceils. To accomplish this, a piasmid was constructed harboring the Red recombinase operon from bacteriophage /,. A fragment contair.ina the Red recombinase genes was synthesized from bacteriophage /■- DNA (New England Bioiub? by PCR using recombination-specific pnmers ZC43.5S6 (SEQ E) NO:29i and ZC43,5S" (SEQ ED NO:30) The reaction contained 100 pmol each of primers ZC43.586 and ZC43.5S7. 10 ul of 10X PCR buffer (Boehringer Mannheim). 1 ul Pwo Polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim'). 10 ul of 0.25 mM nucleotide triphosphate mix (Parkin Elmer), and dtbO in a final volume of 100 ul. The PCR reaction consisted of a<br>
single 5 minute cycle at 94 ~C, followed by 30 cycles of 1 minute at 94 C. 1 minute at 50"C and 1 minute at 72"C. The last of the 30 cycles was followed by a 5-mmute extension at 72~C and the reaction concluded with-an ovemisht hold at 4'C. The resulting 1964 base pair (bp) fragment contained the Red recombinase operon (SEQ ED NO: 31). The nucleotide sequence asjhqyvn in SEQ ED NO:31 encodes for three genes, Gam(y) as shown from nucleotides 41-454. Bet($) as shown from nucleotides 463-1245. and Exo as shown from nucleotides 1245-1922.<br>
The Red recombinase operon was incorporated into a piasmid by-homologous recombination in yeast.

The yeast/DNA mixture was transferred to a 0.2 cm electroporation cuvette and pulsed at 0.75 kV (5 kV/cm), infinite Q, 25 fx¥ capacitor. The transformation mixture was then added to 1 ml of 1.2 M sorbitol and incubated at 30°C for 1 hour. The cells were pla;ed in 500 ul aliquots onto two URA DS plates (2% dextrose, 29c sorbitol) and incubated at 30 C for 2 days. After about 48 hours the Ura* yeast transformants from the plates were suspended in 2 ml FbO and pelleted by centrifugation. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1ml of Qiagen<br>
PI lysis buffer (Qiagen) and transfeixed to a fresh tube containing 1 ml of 0.5mm zirconia/silica beads (Biospec Products Inc.). The cells '.vere lysed. samples were allowed to settle, 250 j.il of lysate were transferred to a fresh tube, and piasmid DNA was isolated using the Qiagen Spin Miniprep kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.<br><br>

The religated pCHANL was transformed into \V3110. Electrocompetent W3110 cells (50 |al) were transformed with 1 ul pCHANl DNA using the electroportation protocol for E.coii described above. After recovery, the entire 250 ul transformation mixture was plated in one aliquot on an LB plate containing 25 mg/L kanamycin. Plates were incubated at 37°C overnight and ten of the resulting clones were picked for further analysis. They were grown at 37°C overnight in 2.0 ml Superbroth II (Becton Dickinson) containing 25 ug/ml kanamycin. The following day, 1.0 ml of the overnight digest was used to confirm the presence of pCHANl. The Qiagen Spin Miniprep Kit was used to make piasmid DNA, following the manufacturer's instructions. The identity of the piasmid was confirmed by restriction digest using EcoRI (Gibco BRL) and NotI (New England Biolabs). Isolate #3 was selected for subsequent experimentation and named EE670.<br>
Generation of a tetracycline fragment for gene replacement in W3110 The tetraevcline sene was chosen as a suitable marker for homologous recombination into   the   OrapT    locus,   rendering   the    OmpT   gene    inactive.

The conditions for the PCR reaction were 1 cycle at 2 minutes at 94:C. followed by 30 cycles of 30 seconds at 94GC, 1 minute at 50°C and 2 minutes at 72X. This was followed by a "-minute extension at 72:C and an overnight hold at 4'C The resulting 1590 bp fragment carries tetp::tet (SEQ ED NO:34).<br>
The PCR reaction was loaded onto a 19c agarose preparative ael to purify the ter :::et fragment. The tetp::tet fragment was cut out of the gel and placed in a 0.5 ml eppendorf tube with a small hole in the bottom that was lined with aquarium filter floss (Finny Products, Inc.. Cincinnati, OH). The tube was inserted into a 1.5 ml eppendorf tube and spun in a tabletop centrifuge at 14,000rpm for 10 minutes at 25°C. The liquid in the bottom of the 1.5 ml tube was mixed with 107c (vol/vol) 3M NaOAc and 2 volumes of 100% Ethanol. The sample was incubated at -203C for 10 minutes and centnfueed for 10 minutes at 4°C in a tabletop centrifuge to precipitate the PCR fragment. The supernatant was aspirated and the pellet resuspended in 50 ul H:0. The tetp::tet fragment was at a working concentration of 50 ng/ul.<br>
The PCR fragment was ligated into the pCR4.0-BLUNT TOPO© vector (Invitrogen) to use as a positive control for the gene replacement experiments. The ligation was performed according to manufacturer's instructions. E.coli DH10B cells (Invitrogen) were transformed with 2 \x\ of the tetp::tet DNA fragment using the electroporation protocol for E.coli described above. Following recovery, the entire 250 |ul transformation mixture was plated on an LB plate containing 100 mg/L Ampicillin (Sigma). Plates were incubated at 37°C overnight.<br>
Ten clones were picked for further analysis. They were grown overnight in 2.0 ml Superbroth II (Becton Dickinson) containing 100 ug/ml ampicillin at 37°C. The following day, 1.0 ml of the overnight culture was used to confirm the presence of plasmid DNA. The Qiagen Spin Miniprep Kit was used to make plasmid DNA, following the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmid DNA was subjected to restriction analysis using Sail (New England Biolabs) and PstI (New England Biolabs) to verify plasmid identity and insert orientation. Isolate #1 was picked for subsequent experimentation. The plasmid was named pSDH185 and the :!one, EE686.<br><br>
Gene replacement in W3110: Deletion of the QmrT gene<br>
A 500 ml culture of W31 iO/pCHAXl was grown at 37°C in SOB media [20 g/L trypton.e. 5 g/L yeast extract, 0.5 g/L NaC. 10 ml/L ol 250 mM KCK 5 ml/L of 2 M MgCk pHT.O] to an ODf)00 of 0.6. The culture was split into four 125 ml cultures. One culture was left as an uninduced control, wiv.'.e the other three were induced with 1 mM IPTG for 15 minutes. 30 minutes, or 60 minutes. At the end of their respective incubations, competent cells were made from all four cultures in the following manner: Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 10 minutes. The supemutants were drained and each pellet was resuspended in 62.5 ml ice cold PLO. The cultures were pelleted again, the supernatant was drained, and each pellet was resuspended in 31.25ml cold 10% glycerol. The cultures were then centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 5 minutes. The pellets were drained well and resusoended in residual 10% glycerol.<br>
All four cultures were divided into six ,50 ul aliquots which were transformed in the following ways: 1&gt; no DNA negative control, 2) 1 ul (1 ug/ul) pBR322 (New England Biolabs) positive control. 3) lul (1 ug/ul) pTAP279 positive control, 4) 1 ul pSDH!S5 positive control, 5) 2 ul (50 ng/ul) tetp::tet fragment, and 6) 4 ul (50 ng/p.1) tetp::tet fragment. The cells were transformed by electroporation as described above for E.coli. Entire transformation mixtures were plated on LB plates containing 10 mg/L tetracycline (Sigma) except for the pTAP279 controls, which were plated on LB plates containing 35 mg/L chloramphenicol (Sigma). "Plates were incubated at 37°C overnight. In addition, 10"° and 10" dilutions (in HMD) of each four culture were plated on LB plates to evaluate overall efficiency of the recombination process by determining the cell number.<br>
The following day, control plates were taken out of the incubator and assessed. Samples transformed with the tetp::tet fragments were allowed to incubate for an additional 24 hours prior to assay. Twenty-six of the largest clones were identified for further analysis.<br>
Characterization of ompT deficient clones<br>
Each of the 26 selected clones was grown overnight at 37°C'in 1 mi of LB with 5 ng/ml tetracycline. The following day, genomic DNA was generated from all 26 clones using the Genomic Prep DNA Isolation Kit (Amersham Pharmacia) according to the manufacturer's instructions.<br>
The genomic DNA from each clone was diluted 1:100 in dH20 to use as a template for PCR analysis. Each diluted sample was assayed using three different sets of PCR primers (three PCR reactions per clone;. The reactions contained 100 pmol ea:h of primer set #1: ZG45,357 (SEQ ID NO:35» and ZG45.350 (SEQ ID N:0:36): or<br><br>
primer set =2: ZG15.353 (SEQ ID NO:37) and ZG45.355 (SEQ ID NO:38 &gt;. or primer sei =3: ZG45.354 (SEQ ID NO:39) and ZG45.359 -SEQ ID NO:40), The remainder of the 100 ui fina! volume was made up of 10 m of 10X PCR buffer -Boehrimzer Mannheim i. 1 ul Pwo Polymerase fBoehringer Mannheim). 10 ui of 0.25 mM nucleotide triphosphate mix (Perkin Elmer) and dH&gt;0. The reaction conditions were: 1<br>
cycle for 5 minutes at 94X, followed by 30 cycles of 30 seconds at 94X. 1 minute at 50 C and 2 minutes at 72°C. The PCR concluded with a 7-minute extension at 72"C and an overnight hold at 4°C. If the OmpT gene in W3110 was successfully replaced with the tetracycline gene, primer set #1 should amplify a 1584 bp band (SEQ ID NO:41), primer set #2 should amplify an 1190 bp band (SEQ ID NO:42&gt;. The results demonstrated that 25 of the 26 clones screened were ompT". W3110 ompT" clones #1 and #3 were selected for subsequent analysis.<br>
To confirm loss of proteolytic activity, IL-21 was incubated with cell lysates from the newly derived ompTstrains and the W3110 parent. Lysate from the ompT" strain. BL21, was included as a positive control. Cells were inoculated into Superbroth II and grown overnight at 37°C. Four 1 ml aliquots of each overnight culture were pelleted at room temperature and the cells were lysed using BugBuster® (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell lysates were incubated at 25°C for 4 hours with either: 1) 0.332 mg/ml of IL-21, or 2) 0.332 mg/ml of IL-Yfm the presence of 5 mM ZnCK Each sample was mixed with an equal volume of NuPAGE 4x Sample Buffer (Invitrogen) containing 2% (3-mercaptoethanol (Sigma). The reduced samples were heated for 5 min at 100°C and 10 /xL were loaded onto a 10% NuPAGE polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen). Electrophoresis was conducted at 130v under denaturing conditions (SDS-PAGE) using lx IVIES running buffer (Invitrogen). Gels were stained with Simply Blue Safestain (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions.<br>
The results indicated that the OmpT protease was inactivated through gene replacement. IL-21 was completely intact after a 4-hour incubation in lysates from BL21, W3110 ompT" #1 and W3110 ompT" #3, but was completely degraded in a lysate from the W3110 parent. The activity of the OmpT protease was inhibited by zinc. In incubations containing 5 mM ZnCl2 the IL-21 remained intact, supporting that OmpT was responsible for the degradation. The newly constructed W3110 ompT strains were named ZGOLD1 (W3110 ompT#l; (deposited at American Type Culture Collection in Manassas, VA. (undesignated at filing time))) and ZGOLD3 (W3110 ompT' #3).<br><br>
Characterization of ZGOLDl and ZGOLD3<br>
ZGOLDl and ZGOLD3 were grown alongside [he W3110 parent for assessment of growth. Cultures of all three strains were grown at 37UC in LB to an OD6oo of 1.0. Cell density was measured hourly to assess growth. Dilutions (10"6. 10"' and 1(T in H:0) of each culture were plated on LB kanamyein plates (see abovej to determine cell number. The results indicate that the growth of the ZGOLD strains is equivalent to that of the W3110 parent strain.<br>
To assess transformation efficiency, cells were harvested and made competent for transformation as described above. Aliquots from each strain were transformed with either: 1) 1 \i\ pTAP337 (IL-21 expression plasmid; ATCC No. PA-4S53), or 2) no DNA (negative control1. Electroporation was earned out as described above. Following recovery, each transformation mixture was plated on an LB plate containing 25 mg/L kanamyein and incubated overnight at 37X. The data indicate that transformation efficiency of W3110 was not affected by the removal of opmT.<br>
Ten clones of each ZGOLD strain transformed with the IL-21 expression vector were selected to'evaluate protein production. The clones were grown at 37°C overnight in Superbroth II (containing 25 ug/ml kanamyein. The overnight cultures wem used to inoculate roller drums containing Superbroth II with 25 ug/ml kanamyein. Cells were srown at 37°C. A second culture of one of the clones was srovvn and served as an uninduced control. When the OD6oo of each culture was 1.5-2.0, they were induced with ImM IPTG (ICN Biomedicals Inc.). Incubation of the cultures continued for another 5 hours. Samples of each culture were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 4-12% gradient NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen) under reducing conditions as described above. The results indicate that IL-21 production by ZGOLDl and ZGOLD3 is equivalent to that of the W3110 parent strain. ZGOLDl/pTAP337 #1 (deposited at American Type Culture Collection in Manassas, VA. (undesignated at filing time),) was selected for further development of the process for EL-21 production.<br>
