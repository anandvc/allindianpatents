				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td><br>
The  present invention  relates  to  a water containing composition  for  the production of coatings and process thereof.<br>
The present invention relates to water-containing compositions, and in particular to aqueous polymer dispersions based on polychloroprene, to processes for their production and to their use, in particular for the production of coatings, and in particular for the production of adhesive coatings, and to a process for bonding substrates using the compositions.<br>
Contact adhesives based on polychloroprene (CR) are predominantly solvent-containing adhesives which are applied to the substrates to be bonded and dried. By then joining the substrates under pressure a bonded structure is obtained having a high initial strength immediately after the joining process. The subsequent crosslinking produces the final curing.<br>
For ecological reasons there is an increasing need for suitable aqueous CR adhesive dispersions which can be processed to form corresponding aqueous CR adhesive formulations. These are for example used in the "spray-mixing" process, in which the aqueous adhesive formulation and a coagulating agent are separately conveyed through a spray gun and finally mixed in the spray jet, after which the CR adhesive coagulates on the substrate. An overview of this method is provided for example in "Handboolc of Adhesives", Irving Skeist, Chapman Hall, New York, 3nd Ed. 1990, Part 15, page 301, R. Musch et al, Adhesives Age, January 2001, page 17, "Spray-Mixing Klebstoffe auf Basis Dispercoll®C fur die Schaumstoff-Klebung" (Spray-mixing adhesives based on Dispercoll®C for the bonding of foams). Technical Brochure from Bayer AG, No. KA-KR-000 ld/01/05.96.<br>
It is however frequently necessary to add additives, such as for example stabilizers, to the aqueous CR dispersions or formulations, in order to ensure that they have the necessary stability in storage and reliability for use or that the adhesive layers are also protected from ageing or discolouration.<br>
For the latter puipose zinc oxide is advantageously added to aqueous formulations, since, where formulations based on polychloroprene dispersions are used, zinc oxide counteracts rapid ageing of the bonded seam and discolouration of the bonded substrates by the cleavage of HC1 from the CR polymer.<br><br><br>
The zinc oxide types so Far known do however lend to form sediments and the known zinc oxide dispersions are prone to phase separation (so-called "phasing"). This sedimentation or phase separation is not acceptable, particularly where such adhesive formulations are used in the "spray-mixing" process, since blockages are produced in the nozzle as a result. The cleansing of the nozzle is highly time-consuming and costly and economically unsatisfactory<br>
In order to solve ihe problem of the sedimentation of zinc oxide, various processes have been described for producing stable, non-sedimenting zinc oxide dispersions.<br>
DE-A 19 703 582 describes the production of a zinc oxide paste by processing a commercially available zinc oxide with a wetting agent to form an aqueous zinc oxide paste. This paste has a number of disadvantages for use in aqueous adhesive dispersions. On the one hand the paste is highly viscous and thixotropic and therefore difficult to process. Also, after (he paste has been incorporated into the aqueous adhesive dispersion, its resistance to sedimentation is reduced, since the zinc oxide particles in commercially available zinc oxides are present in a highly agglomerated form and the agglomerates are not completely dispersed by the described process. Also, agglomeration means that the reactive surface area is only partially available so that relatively high starting quantities of zinc oxide have to be used to obtain the required effect of the HCI absorption.<br>
WO95/24359 describes a colloidal zinc oxide and a process for producing colloidal solutions by grinding conventional, highly agglomerated zinc oxides in the presence of polyacrylic acid, the resulting colloidal solution containing agglomerates of 
 <br>
The prior art describes the use of nanczinc oxide dispersions for various applications. The term "nanoparticles" generally refers to particles having a diameter of less than about 100 nm.<br>
Due to its large reactive particle surface area nanoparticulate zinc oxide is suitable for use as a catalyst. It is a particularly important activator for crosslinking polymers, and in particular rubbers, as described for example in WO02/083797. Compared with conventional zinc-oxides with a smaller active surface area, comparable polymer crosslinking is obtained with considerably lower quantities of nanoparticulate zinc oxide.<br>
Zinc oxide nanoparticles with particle sizes of less than about 30 nm are also suitable for use as UV absorbers in transparent organic/inorganic hybrid materials, plastics, lacquers and non-adhesive coatings. In addition, they can also be used for protecting UV-sensitive organic dyes and pigments.<br>
Particles or agglomerates which are larger than about 30 nm lead to scattered light effects and thus (o an undesirable reduction in transparency in the visible light range.<br>
The problem on which the present invention is based was that of providing an aqueous, phasing-resistant adhesive composition which, after being applied to the substrates to be bonded and after joining has high resistance to the cleavage of HCI from the polymer and which is suitable for use in spraying processes such as for example the "spray-mixing" process without any blockages being formed in the nozzles.<br>
It was found that by combining polychloroprene dispersions with specific aqueous nano ZnO dispersions, adhesive formulations can be obtained which do not form sediments and which do not display any specks even when being processed to form very thin films. They have high resistance to the cleavage of HCI.<br>
The present invention relates to a composition containing:<br>
a)	polychloroprene particles,<br>
b)	zinc oxide particles whose average particle size is less than 150 nm and<br>
c)	water.<br><br>
The composition  is present in particular in the form of an aqueous dispersion.<br>
Polyehloroprene particles according to the invention are understood to be particles of polychloroprene (poly(2-chloro-l,3-butadiene) and chloroprene-containing copolymers.<br>
The polychloroprene (poly(2-chloro-I,3-butadiene) particles are appropriately added to the composition according to the invention in the form of aqueous dispersions. The production of such polychloroprene dispersions is known per se and they are produced for example by the emulsion polymerization of chloroprene and optionally an ethylenically unsaturated monomer copolymerizable with chloroprene in an alkaline medium, as described for example in WO02/24835 (cf. the section from line 26 on page 3 to line 4 on page 7), DE-A 3 002 734 (cf. the section from line 23 on page 8 to line 9 on page 12) or US-A 5 773 544 (cf. the section from line 9 in column 2 to line 45 in column 4). Polychloroprene dispersions are particularly preferred which are produced by continuous polymerization, as described for example in example 2 of WO 02/24825 and example 6 of DE-A 3 002 734, it being possible to vary the modifier content from between 0.01% by weight and 0.3% by weight.<br>
In a preferred variant of the invention the poiychloroprene particles have an average primary particle diameter of less than 220 nm.<br>
The term "primary particles" refers, analogously to DIN 53206; 1992-08, to particles identifiable as individual particles by suitable physical processes. The term "diameter" can be used when referring to polychloroprene particles, since they are approximately spherical.<br>
According to the invention, the average primary particle diameter of the polychloroprene particles is preferably determined with the aid of an ultracentrifuge; cf: H. G. Muller, Progr. Colloid Polym, Sci. 107, 180-188 (1997). The values refer to the weight average.<br>
An average primary particle diameter of greater than 220 nm is disadvantageous since undesired sedimentation occurs when removing the remaining 2-chIoro-l,3-butadiene monomer from the polychloroprene dispersion by steam distillation.<br>
In an additional preferred variant of the invention the polychloroprene particles have an average primary particle diameter of greater than 60 nm.<br><br>
An average primary particle diameter of less than 60 nm is disadvantageous since the polymer dispersion can only be concentrated with great difficulty to a solids content of &gt; 55% by weight.<br>
The polychloroprene particles preferably have an average primary particle diameter of about 60 to about 220 nm, and more preferably of about 70 to about 160 nm. The abovementioned average primary particle diameters of the polychloroprene particles are present both in the aqueous dispersions used for the production of the compositions according to the invention and in the resulting compositions according to the invention.<br>
The compositions according to the invention also contain zinc oxide particles whose average particle size is less than 150 nm, preferably less than 100 nm and even more preferably less than 50 nm. Since the zinc oxide particles are not spherical, reference is made to average particle size as opposed to average particle diameter.<br>
The zinc oxide particles can be present in the compositions according to the invention both in the form of so-called primary particles and in the form of agglomerates. According to the invention, the term "average particle size of the ZnO particles" refers to the average particle size determined by ultracentrifugation and includes the size of primary particles and optionally existing agglomerates (cf: H, G. MUller, Prog. Colloid Polym. Sci. 107, 180-188 (1997)). The values refer to the weight average.<br>
The weight-averaged average particle size determined by ultracenlrifugation is at most 150 urn and preferably at most 100 nm and particularly preferably at most 50 nm, at least 90% by weight of all of the particles preferably being smaller than 200 nm, preferably smaller than 150 nm and particularly preferably smaller than 100 nm.<br>
An average particle size of greater than 150 nm is disadvantageous since there is then the danger of sedimentation and the product is less reactive. By means of TEM photographs (transmission electron-microscopic photographs) it is also possible to determine the number-average particle size of the ZnO primary particles by counting and statistical analysis according to WO 00/50503. As already mentioned above the term "primary particles" refers according to DIN 53206; 1992-08 to particles identifiable as individual particles by suitable physical processes.<br><br>
The average particle size of the primary particles is at most 100 nm, preferably at most 50 urn, more preferably at most 30 nm and even more preferably at most 15 nm.<br>
The zinc oxide particles arc appropriately added to the compositions according to the invention in the form of aqueous ZnO dispersions having an average particle size of 
In an additional preferred variant of the invention the aqueous ZnO dispersion is a zinc oxide sol having an average primary particle size of less than 30 nm, and preferably less than 15 nm. The sol contains water optionally mixed with high-boiling solvents, such as triethanolamine or ethylene glycol. The particle sizes of the aqueous ZnO dispersions employed correspond to the particle sizes in the compositions according to the invention, i.e. their particle sizes do not change to any substantial degree on incorporation into the compositions according to the invention.<br>
In a preferred variant of the invention, the compositions according to the invention contain additional additives, such as in particular silicon dioxide particles. In combination with zinc oxide, the silicon dioxide particles result in an increase in the viscosity of the adhesive<br>
dispersion.<br>
Preferably, the average silicon dioxide particle size or the average diameter of the silicon dioxide particles (the particles are approximately spherical), as determined by ultracentrifugation (as mentioned above), is in the range from 1 to 400 nm, more preferably in the range from 5 to 100 nm, and particularly preferably in the range from 8 to 50 nm. The average silicon dioxide particle diameter includes the particle diameter of the primary particles and possibly existing agglomerates.<br>
The silicon dioxide particles are added to the compositions according to the invention preferably in the form of aqueous silicon dioxide dispersions having an average particle size of the SiO= particles of 1 to 400 nm, preferably 5 to 100 nm and particularly preferably 8 to 50 nm.<br><br>
Particularly preferably, the above-mentioned aqueous silicon dioxide dispersions are added to the compositions according to the invention in the form of water-containing silica sols. The particle sizes of the silica sols employed do not change to any substantial degree on incorporation into the compositions according to the invention.<br>
In an additional preferred variant of the invention the compositions according to the invention contain at least one anti-ageing agent which is different from the abovementioned ZnO particles. The anti-ageing agents are preferably based on oligofunctional secondary aromatic amines and/or oligofunctional substituted phenols.<br>
The aqueous dispersions of zinc oxide having an average particle size of 
I)	A   zinc  oxide  sol  as described  for example  in  WO  00/50503,  produced  by<br>
redispersing zinc oxide gels having an average primary particle size of = 15 nm.<br>
Suitable solvents are water or water/ethylene glycol mixtures, optionally with the<br>
addition of surface-modifying compounds.<br>
or<br>
II)	Zinc oxide sols such as for example those described in WO02/083797 having an<br>
average primary particle size of 
nm, produced for example by the process described in W002/083797.<br>
ZnO dispersions which are produced with surface-modified zinc oxides such as those described for example in DB-A 10 163 256, for example by one of the processes described therein, are also suitable for producing the compositions according to the invention.<br>
Aqueous dispersions of silicon dioxide which can be used for producing the compositions according to the invention have been known for a long time. They have different structures depending on the production process employed.<br><br>
Silicon dioxide dispersions suitable according to the invention can be obtained on the basis of silica sol, silica gel, pyrogenic silicas or precipitated silicas or mixtures thereof and they are described in DE 10224898.2.<br>
If SiO2 raw materials present in the form of isolated solids, such as for example pyrogenic or precipitated silica, are used for producing the compositions according to the invention, they are converted by dispersion into an aqueous SiO2 dispersion.<br>
Prior art dispersion devices and preferably such dispersion devices which are suitable for producing high shear rates, such as for example Ultratorrax or dissolver discs, are used for producing the silicon dioxide dispersions.<br>
Preferably such aqueous silicon dioxide dispersions are used whose SiO2 particles have an average particle diameter of 1 to 400 nm, preferably 5 to 100 rim and particularly preferably 8 to 50 nm. If precipitated silicas are used, the particles are comminuted by grinding.<br>
Preferred polymer dispersions according to the invention are those in which the Si02 particles of the silicon dioxide dispersion dl) are present as discrete non-crosslinked primary particles.<br>
It is also preferred for the SiG2particles to have hydroxyl groups on their particle surface. Aqueous silica sols are particularly preferably used as aqueous silicon dioxide dispersions.<br>
The anti-ageing agents d2) are not the zinc oxide particles b) but preferably those based on oligofunctional secondary aromatic amines or oligofunclional substituted phenols such as products of the 6 PPD, DTPD, DBA, BPH or BHT type, etc., as described for example in the "Handbuch fur die Gummiindustne" (The rubber industry manual), 1992 edition, Bayer AG, Leverkusen, Chapter 4 Vulkanox', page 423. Vulkanox DDA, a diphenylamine derivative, is particularly effective.<br>
In order to produce the compositions according to the invention aqueous dispersions of components a), b) and dl) are appropriately mixed in portions of:<br>
polychloroprene dispersion (a) 50 to 99.99% by weight,<br><br>
zinc oxide dispersion (h)	0.01 to 10% by weight,<br>
silicon dioxide dispersion (d I) 0 to 40% by weight,<br>
wherein the weight percentages in each case refer to the solids content of the composition, which adds up to 100%. (Unless stated otherwise, the following weight percentages also refer to me solids content.) The solids content refers to the weight of the non-volatile components, such as in particular polychloroprene, ZnO and Si02. The volatile components include in particular the high-boiling solvents which can be distilled off at up to 250°/15 mm Hg. The solids content adds up to 100%j by weight. In addition, the anti-ageing agent (d2) can be added in quantities of preferably 0 to 10% by weight, and preferably 0 to 3% by weight, based on the solids content of the composition.<br>
For the production of phasing-resistant mixtures the polymer dispersions according to the invention preferably have a content of 90 to 99.9% by weight of a polychloroprene dispersion (a) and 10 to 0.1% by weight of a zinc oxide dispersion (bj, wherein the percentages relate to the solids content of the composition.<br>
For the production of adhesives having optimum resistance to the cleavage of HC1 it is also possible to add preferably 0.1 - 10% by weight, and more preferably 0.2 - 3% by weight, of an additional anti-ageing agent (d2), preferably based on oligofunctional secondary aromatic amines or oligofunctional substituted phenols (d2) by themselves or in combination with 2% by weigh! to 30% by weight of a silica sol dispersion (dl).<br>
In addition, the composition according to the invention can contain 0 to 79.99% by weight of other conventional adhesive auxiliaries and additives.<br>
These include lor example other polymers, such as for example polyacrylates, polyvinylidene chloride, polybuladiene, polyvinyl acetate and/or styrene/butadiene rubbers which can preferably be added in the form of aqueous dispersions in a quantity of up to 30% by weight, based on the solids content of the composition. Such polymers can be used in order to modify the property spectrum of the adhesive compositions.<br>
Additional examples of the adhesive auxiliaries and additives are for example fillers, such as quartz powder, quartz sand, barite, calcium carbonate, chalk, dolomite or talc, optionally together with wetting agents, such as for example polyphosphates, such as sodium<br><br>

When the compositions are used as adhesives, maximum contents of the fillers of about 30 to 40% by weight are preferred, based on the solids content of the composition. A content of polychloroprene particles of more than 40% by weight is preferred.<br>
When the compositions are used as sealing agents, maximum contents of the fillers of about 60 to 75% by weight are preferred, based on the solids content of the composition. A content of the polychloroprene particles of less than 40% by weight is preferred.<br>

C2 Determination of the sedimentation properties<br>
Production of an adhesive based on (he polychloroprene dispersion according to the<br>
invention<br>
For the production of the formulation, the polychloroprene dispersion is initially introduced into a glass beaker. While stirring, the stabilizer, the anti-ageing agent, the resin and, for<br>
colourinii ihe dispersion, Levanyl® blue are added. This allows sediments of zinc oxide to he more readily visible.<br>
The adhesive mixture is examined daily for phase separation and assessed according to the following legend:<br>
0	= no change<br>
1	= slight sediment formation on the base<br>
2	= high degree of sediment formation on the base<br>
3	= solid precipitate on the base<br>

Measuring  method<br>
Measuring device : 763 PVC - Thermomat from Metrohm, 9101 Herisau, Switzer land<br>
The samples (of a thickness of 0.1-1 mm) are cut to an edge length of about 2-3 mm, 0.2 g are weighed into a test tube and the measurement is carried out at 180°C, using air as the carrier gas. The electrical resistance of svater in which the HCI gas formed redissolves is measured. The HCI resistance referred to is the point in time at which the electrical resistance reaches a value of 50 μs/cm. The higher the value is, the more resistant the sample tested is to the cleavage of HCI.<br>

*) example according to the invention<br>
As test 1 shows, zinc oxide is sedimented during the resting phase in the vessel and the pipe, so that it is no longer possible to start the test without problems on the 2'"' and 3"' days. On using nano zinc oxide according to the invention the dispersion can be sprayed without any problems even alter ii has been left to stand in the device for a long period.<br>

Fig. 1: Resistance of polychloroprene to cleavage of HCI<br>
As is clear from the diagram, the nano zinc oxide dispersion according to the invention (tests 5-14) produces considerably improved resistance of polychloroprene to cleavage of HCI compared with a corresponding standard ZnO dispersion.<br><br>

(Table Removed)   example, according to the invention<br>
The table shows that the ZnO-free formulation no. 20 has only slight resistance to cleavage of MCI and a conventional ZnO dispersion (nos. 21 and 22) improves resistance to cleavage of HCI, whereas identical quantities of the zinc oxides (nos. 23 and 24) according to the invention considerably increase resistance.<br>
As a comparison of tests 6, 7 and 25 shows, the addition of nano silicon dioxide to a dispersion having a low content of zinc oxide produces additional resistance to the cleavage of HCI<br><br><br><br><br>
