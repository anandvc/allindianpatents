				<td>LD OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
This indention relates to novel alkyl amino substituted naphtho [1, 2-d] oxazoles. More particularly the present invention is relates to the novel naphtha [1, 2-d] oxazole phenoxy-subsitutied alkyl amino derivaties, their preparation and use as anti-hyperglycemic agents (Anti-diabetic) and for the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disorders (CVS) The main objective of the present invention is to provide agents to act in non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) with the added advantage of their effect in the treatment and prevention of CVS disorders.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
An analysis of the molecular structure of active PPARy-agonists mentioned above would suggest the presence of four distinct substructures unit. (A unit) the thiazolidine 2,4-dione (B unit) the intermediate alkyl chain (C unit) alkyl chain as linker and (d unit) the aryl/heteroaryl substituent. Since the thiazolidine 2,4-dione derivatives are associated with side effects such as liver toxicity etc, a molecular modification to eliminate such a unit was considered desirable. In the present invention the thiazolidine 2 4-dic-ie unit has been replaced by substituted amino residues which has resulted in novel compounds showing the desired anti-hyperglycemic activity along with lipid lowering activity which is an added desirable activity.<br>

BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY<br>
A         ANTIDIABETIC ACTIVITY ANIMALS:<br>
Adult male and female albino rats (Sprague Dawley) of body weight 160±20g, bred in CDRI animal house were used during the course of experiment; 6 animals were kept in one cage. All the animals were fed ad-lib standard pellet diet (Lipton, Bombay) and allowed unrestricted access to water. The following norms were followed for animal room environment. Temperature: 22 ± 1°C; Humidity: 50-50%; Light 300 Lux at floor level with regular 12 hours light cycle; noise level 50 decibels; ventilation 10-50 air changes per hour.<br>
The blood-glucose lowering effects of the test samples/standard drugs were examined in the following two experimental models.<br>
Sucrose-loaded rat model:<br>
Overnight fasted male Sprague Dawley rats were used for the sucrose-loaded experiment. Blood was collected at 'O'min from the tail vein of the animals. After the '0' min blood collection, samples/drugs were given to the test group consisting of 5 rats by oral gavage at a dose of 100 mg/kg. Half an hour post test sample treatment, a sucrose-load of 10.0 gm/kg body weight was given to each rat. The blood was collected at 30, 60, 90 &amp; 120 min post sucrose-load.<br>
Streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat model:<br>
Single-dose effect; Sprague Dawley strain male albino rats of average body weight 160±20 g were selected for this study. A calculated amount of the fresh solution of STZ dissolved in 100 mM citrate buffer (ph 4.5) was injected to overnight fasted rats (60 mg/Kg) intraperitoneally. Blood was checked for glucose content 48 h later by glucometer &amp; animals showing blood glucose profile above 250 mg/dl were selected<br>
and were divided into different groups. Blood-glucose levels were again tested at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 24 h post test sample/drug administration. Food but not water was withdrawn from the cages during the experiment.<br>
Sucrose challenged Streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat model:<br>
Single-dose effect; Sprague Dawley strain male albino rats of average body weight 160±20 g were selected for this study. A calculated amount of the fresh solution of STZ dissolved in 100 mM citrate buffer (ph 4.5) was injected to overnight fasted rats (60 mg/Kg) intraperitoneally.<br>
Blood was checked for glucose content 48 h later by glucometer &amp; animals showing blood glucose profile between 150-250 mg/dl were selected and were divided into different groups. Half an hour post test sample treatment, a sucrose-load of 2.5 g/kg body weight was given to each rat. Blood-glucose levels were again tested at 30, 60, 90, 120,180, 240, 300 min and 24 h post test sample/drug administration. Food but not water was withdrawn from the cages during the experiment.<br>
1} Hypoglycaemic activity of Test Compounds (compound no.5, 6,10 and 12), Glybenclamide and Gliclazide in normal rats:<br>
The antidiabetic effect of test compounds (compound no 5, 6 and 10) and standard drug Glybenclamide, Gliclazide on OGTT of normal rats was determined. At 100-mg/kg doses level, test compounds 5,6,10,12 Glybenclamide and Gliclazide showed significant lowering 26.9%, 35.9%, 27.8 %, 33.6 %, 33.9% and 44.8% respectively, at 120 min post glucose load.<br>
2) Hypoglycaemic activity of example 6, Glybenclamide and Gliclazide in STZ-induced diabetic rats:<br>
The effect of Test compound 2-[-4-(-Piperidin-1-yl-propoxy)-phenyl]-naptho[1,2-djoxazole (12) and standard antidiabetic drug Glybenclamide and gliclazide on blood glucose lowering in STZ-induced diabetic rats were determined. At 100 mg/kg dose level compound 12, Glybenclamide and gliclazide showed significant lowering on blood glucose. The lowering started from 1-hour that persisted up to 7-hours post drug administration. The lowering was of the order 26.0%, 32.8% and 27.7% respectively in case of test compound 6, Glybenclamide and gliclazide<br>
3^ Hypoglycaemic activity of compound no. 5, 6 and compound no 12. (compounds 5,6<br>
&amp;12) in sucrose challenged STZ-induced diabetic rats:<br>
The effect of compound 5 and 6 on blood glucose lowering in sucrose challenged STZ-induced diabetic rats was determined. At 100 mg/kg dose level, compounds 5 and 6 did showed moderate lowering (16. 64% ,27.4 and 16.80 %respectively) and in blood glucose.<br>
B. Lipid lowering activity of compound no. 5 and compound no. 6<br>
Lipid lowering activity of compound-5 &amp; 6 was evaluated in two different models (a)Triton Model: compound 5 and 6 showed the lowering in chol (14,21%) Tg.(11,14%) at 100 mg/kg respectively.<br>
(b) Dyslipemic Hamster Model: Feeding with test compound no 5 reduced levels of plasma Tg, chol, glycerol, HDL by 18, 8,14,15 respectively. Similarly for compound no 6 reduced levels of plasma Tg, chol, glycerol, HDL by 14,11,12,17 at 300 umole/kg respectively.<br>
Anti-hyperglycemic Activity in db/db mice :<br>
The db/db mouse is a well-characterised model of type 2 diabetes. The background for the db/db mouse is the C57BL/Ks strain. The major deficiency of the C57BL/KsBom-db mouse (db/db) is lack of a functional leptin receptor. This leads to defective leptin signalling and a complete lack of feedback from leptin. Both hypothalamic NPY content and secretion are consequently elevated, and this result in hyperphagia and decreased energy expenditure, obesity, insulin-resistance, hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycaemia and dyslipidemia. The db/db mouse develops NIDDM from around week 10. The disease is stable until week 20, where destruction of pancreatic D-cells can be recognized clinically as decreasing levels of plasma insulin and very severe hyperglycaemia. The db/db mouse has a maximal life span of 9 -12 months. The male mice are more diabetic than, and will normally die earlier than the females. The advantage of using male mice for experimental purposes is that the fluctuations in plasma parameters are less than in the females where the oestrogen cycle affects the clinical diabetes. The optimal age of db/db mice used for experiments will be from week 12 to 18 when they have developed NIDDM with diabetic dyslipidemia but still have functional D-cells in the pancreas. C57BL/KsBom-db mice 12-18 weeks, 40 - 50 g bred in the animal house of CDRI,<br>
Lucknow. 10 mice (5 males and 5 females) were used in the experiments. The mice were housed in groups of 5 (same sex) in a room controlled for temperature (23 ± 2.0 °C) and 12/12 hours light/dark cycle (lights on at 6.00 am). Body weight was measured daily from day 1 to day 10. All animals had free access to fresh water and to normal chow except on the days of the postprandial protocol day 6 and during the overnight fast before the OGTT on day 10. The animals always had access to water during experimental periods. Blood glucose was checked every morning up till day 5. On day 6 postprandial protocol was employed, in this method blood glucose was checked at -0.5h and Oh Test drugs were given to the treatment group whereas vehicle received only gum acacia (1.0%); the blood glucose was again checked at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6h post test drug treatment. On day 8, blood was collected for serum insulin measurements and finally on day 10 an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed after an overnight fasting. Blood glucose was measured at -30.0 min and test drugs were administered. The blood glucose was again measured at 0.0 min post treatment and at this juncture glucose solution was given at a dose of 3 gm/kg to all the groups including vehicle. The blood glucose levels were checked at 30 min, 60 min, 90 min and 120 min post glucose administration. Compounds 5,6 and 12 showed ( 16,2land 18 %) blood glucose lowering effect on postprandial protocol on day 3 in db/db. (detail results are in Table 2)<br>
