				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to a Broadband Wireless Access (BWA)<br>
communication system, and in particular, to a system and a method for<br>
transmitting a traffic indication message by a base station in a BWA<br>
communication system using an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing<br>
(OFDM)/Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA).<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
In a 4th generation (4G) communication system, which is a next generation<br>
communication system, active research is being conducted on technology for<br>
providing users with services guaranteeing various Qualities-of-Service (QoSs) at<br>
a data rate of about 100 Mbps.<br>
A current 3rd generation (3G) communication system generally supports a data<br>
rate of about 384 Kbps in an outdoor channel environment having a relatively<br>
poor channel environment, and supports a data rate of a maximum of about 2<br>
Mbps in an indoor channel envirornment having a relatively good channel<br>
environment. A Wireless Local Area Network (LAN) system and a Wireless<br>
Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) system generally support a data rate of 20<br>
Mbps to 50 Mbps.<br><br>
Therefore, in the current 4G communication system, active research is being<br>
performed on a new communication system securing mobility and QoS for the<br>
Wireless LAN system and the Wireless MAN system supporting a relatively high<br>
data rate in order to support a high-speed service that the 4G communication<br>
system intends to provide.<br>
The Wireless MAN system having wide coverage and supporting a high data rate<br>
is suitable for a high-speed communication service. However, because the<br>
Wireless MAN system does not consider the mobility of users or subscriber<br>
stations (SSs), it never considers a handoff caused by high-speed movement of<br>
subscriber stations.<br><br>
In FIG. 1, a description will be made of a configuration of a<br>
communication system employing an IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics<br>
Engineers) 802.16a standard, i.e., a standard specification for the Wireless MAN<br>
system (hereinafter referred to as an "IEEE 802.16a communication system).<br>
More specifically, FIG. 1 is a diagram schematically illustrating a BWA<br>
communication system using an OFDM/OFDMA.<br>
However, before a description of FIG. 1 is given, it is well known that the<br>
Wireless MAN system, i.e., a BWA communication system, has wider coverage<br>
and supports a higher data rate compared with the Wireless LAN system. The<br>
IEEE 802.16a communication system refers to a communication system utilizing<br>
an OFDM/OFDMA to support a. broadband transmission network for a physical<br>
channel of the Wireless MAN system.<br>
That is, the IEEE 802.16a communication system refers to a BWA<br>
communication system employing OFDM/OFDMA. The IEEE 802.16a<br>
communication system, as it applies OFDM/OFDMA to the Wireless MAN<br>
system, transmits a physical channel signal using multiple subcarriers, thereby<br>
enabling high-speed data transmission.<br>
An IEEE 802.16e communication system is a communication system that<br>
considers mobility of subscriber stations in the IEEE 802.16a communication<br>
system. Currently, no specification has been provided for the IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system.<br>
As a result, both the IEEE 802.16a communication system and the IEEE<br>
802.16e communication system correspond to a BWA communication system<br>
utilizing OFDM/OFDMA, and for convenience, the following description will be<br>
made with reference to the IEEE 802.16a communication system. In the<br>
description below, a term "mobile station (MS)" or "mobile subscriber station<br>
(MSS)" is used to describe a "subscriber station (SS)" that it has mobility.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, the IEEE 802.16a communication system has a<br>
single-cell configuration, and includes a base station (BS) 100 and a plurality of<br>
subscriber stations (SSs) 110, 120, and 130, which are controlled by the BS 100.<br>
Signal transmission and reception between the BS 100 and the SSs 110, 120, and<br>
130 is achieved using OFDM/OFDMA.<br><br>
In the IEEE 802.16e communication system, if mobility of subscriber<br>
stations is taken into consideration, power consumption of the subscriber stations<br>
is an important factor for the system. Therefore, a sleep mode operation and an<br>
awake mode operation between the BS and the subscriber stations have been<br>
proposed to minimize the power consumption of the subscriber stations.<br>
FIG 2 is a diagram schematically illustrating a sleep mode operation<br>
proposed in the IEEE 802.16e communication system. However, before a<br>
description of FIG. 2 is given, it is noted that the sleep mode has been proposed to<br>
minimize power consumption of an MSS in an idle interval for which no packet<br>
data is transmitted during packet data transmission. That is, in the sleep mode,<br>
both the MSS and the BS state transition to the sleep mode, thereby minimizing<br>
power consumption of the MSS in the idle interval for which no packet data is<br>
transmitted.<br>
Generally, the packet data is generated on a burst-by-burst basis.<br>
Therefore, it is unreasonable that an interval for which no packet data is<br>
transmitted is identical in operation to an interval for which packet data is<br>
transmitted. Accordingly, the sleep mode has been proposed. However, when<br>
there is transmission packet data while the BS and the MSS are in the sleep mode<br>
state, both the BS and the MSS must simultaneously state transition to an awake<br>
mode to exchange the packet data.<br>
The sleep mode has been proposed to minimize not only the power<br>
consumption but also interference between channel signals. However, because the<br>
packet data is considerably affected by traffic, the sleep mode operation should be<br>
performed considering a traffic characteristic and a transmission method of the<br>
packet data.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, reference numeral 211 represents a packet data<br>
generation pattern. The packet data generation pattern includes multiple ON-<br>
intervals and multiple OFF-intervals. The ON-intervals correspond to burst<br>
intervals for which packet data, or traffic, is generated, and the OFF-intervals<br>
correspond to idle intervals for which no traffic is generated.<br>
The MSS and the BS state transition to the sleep mode or the awake<br>
mode according to the traffic generation pattern, thereby minimizing power<br>
consumption of the MSS and removing interference between channel signals.<br><br>
Reference numeral 213 represents state transition (or mode change) of the<br>
BS and the MSS. The state transition pattern includes multiple awake modes and<br>
multiple sleep modes. In the awake modes, in which traffic is generated, packet<br>
data is exchanged between the BS and the MSS. However, in the sleep modes,<br>
when no traffic is generated, no packet data is exchanged between the BS and the<br>
MSS.<br>
Reference numeral 215 represents an MSS power level pattern. As<br>
illustrated in FIG. 2, a power level of the MSS in the awake mode is defined as<br>
'K', and a power level of the MSS in the sleep mode is defined as "M."<br>
Comparing the power level K of the MSS in the awake mode with the power level<br>
M of the MSS in the sleep mode, the power level M is much lower than the power<br>
level K. That is, in the sleep mode, almost no power is consumed because no<br>
packet data is exchanged.<br>
In operation, a MSS should receive a state transition approval from a BS<br>
in order to make a state transition to the sleep mode, and the BS transmits packet<br>
data after permitting the MSS to make a state transition to the sleep mode.<br>
In addition, the BS should inform that there is packet data to be<br>
transmitted to the MSS, during a listening interval of the MSS. In this case, the<br>
MSS should awake from the sleep mode and determines whether there is packet<br>
data to be transmitted from the BS.<br>
If it is determined that there is packet data to be transmitted from the BS,<br>
the MSS state transitions to the awake mode and receives the packet data from the<br>
BS. However, if it is determined that there is no packet data to be transmitted<br>
from the BS, the MSS can return to the sleep mode.<br>
A description will now be made of the parameters required to support the<br>
sleep mode operation and the awake mode operation.<br>
(1) Basic Connection Identifier (CID)<br>
A CID proposed in the IEEE 802.16e communication system is illustrated<br>
in Table 1, and is used for identifying a connection between a BS and an MSS.<br><br><br>
As illustrated in Table 1, the CID has a size of 16 bits, and is generally<br>
used for a header of a Medium Access Control (MAC) frame to identify a<br>
connection. Alternatively, however, the CID is also used for a MAC Service Data<br>
Unit (SDU), like a CID described below with reference to a traffic indication<br>
message.<br>
With reference to Table 1, a description will now be made of each CID.<br>
-	Initial Ranging CID: This is a CID for a ranging request (RNG-REQ)<br>
message that an MSS transmits to a BS in order to be allocated a Primary<br>
Management CID and a Basic CID, and all MSSs should know a value 0x0000 of<br>
the Initial Ranging CID. In an Association process to the BS, the MSS informs<br>
the BS of its own MAC address through a ranging request message, such that the<br>
BS preferentially maps a MAC address of the MSS, a CID indicating the MSS,<br>
for example, a Primary Management CID described below, and a Basic CID.<br>
-	Primary Management CID: This is a CID used for MAC Management<br><br>
message processing, which should be necessarily performed between a MSS and<br>
a BS, and the Primary Management CID is used for identifying the MSS. As<br>
illustrated in Table 1, one BS can manage/identify m MSSs.<br>
Herein, 'm' refers to the number of MSSs that can be managed by the BS,<br>
and can have a different value according to capacity of the BS. The Primary<br>
Management CID is a CID that the MSS acquires by a ranging response (RNG-<br>
RSP) message.<br>
-	Basic CID: This is a CID used for MAC Management message<br>
processing, which should be optionally performed between a MSS and a BS, and<br>
the Basic CID is used for identifying the MSS. As illustrated in Table 1, the Basic<br>
CID covers m MSSs, like the Primary Management CID. In addition, the Basic<br>
CID, like the Primary Management CID, is a CID that the MSS acquires by a<br>
ranging response message.<br>
-	Broadcast CID: This is a CID indicating a message that all MSSs should<br>
receive and process, and the Broadcast CID has a value OxFFFF that all MSSs<br>
already know.<br>
-	Multicast Polling CID: This is a CID allocated/released by a Multicast<br>
Polling Allocation Request (MPA-REQ) message, and the Multicast Polling CID<br>
is used in Multicast Polling Service and can make a total of 253 multicast groups.<br>
-	Transport CID: This is a CID used for transmission/reception of general<br>
user data traffic. The Transport CID is allocated through a Dynamic Service<br>
Addition Response (DSA-RSP) message responsive to a BS-Initiated DSA<br>
Request (DSA-REQ) message and an MSS-Initiated DSA-REQ message, and the<br>
total number of available Transport CIDs is calculated as shown in Equation (1).<br>
Maximum Number of Transport CIDs = Total Number (65535) of CIDs -<br>
Number (m) of Primary Management CIDs - Number (m) of Basic CIDs -<br>
Number (1) of Initial Ranging CIDs - Number (1) of Broadcast CIDs<br>
	(1)<br>
- Secondary Management CID: This represents a CID for management<br>
connection for an upper layer such as Simple Network Management Protocol<br>
(SNMP)/Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP), and is allocated by a registration<br><br>
response (REG-RSP) message. The total number of available Secondary<br>
Management CIDs falls within the same range as the number of the Transport<br>
CIDs, but a part of the Secondary Management CIDs is used within the range.<br>
- Adaptive Antenna System (AAS) Initial Ranging CID: This is a CID<br>
used for allocating an Initial Ranging period for AAS devices by a BS supporting<br>
an AAS.<br>
The Basic CID is used to identify an MSS by a BS. In addition, the Basic<br>
CID is allocated by an RNG-RSP message received from the BS while the MSS is<br>
performing an Association process to the BS, i.e., performing ranging. That is, the<br>
Basic CID is one of the CIDs that the BS maps to unique MAC addresses of the<br>
MSSs on a one-to-one basis. In addition, until the MSS is de-associated, the Basic<br>
CID is used for designating only the MSS, and has a unique value only within one<br>
BS. Therefore, the Basic CID can be used for designating a particular MSS in one<br>
BS.<br>
For the MSS, the BS allocates the 16-bit Basic CID value, and the BS can<br>
allocate as many Basic CID values as the maximum number of MSSs that the BS<br>
can manage. For example, if the BS can manage m MSS, the Basic CID has a<br>
value between 1 and m.<br>
(2) Sleep Interval<br>
The sleep interval can be requested by an MSS and can be allocated by a<br>
BS in response to a request from the MSS. The sleep interval represents a time<br>
interval for which the MSS maintains the sleep mode until a start of the listening<br>
interval, after state transitioning to the sleep mode. That is, the sleep interval is<br>
defined as a time for which the MSS stays in the sleep mode.<br>
Even after the sleep interval, the MSS can continuously stay in the sleep<br>
mode if there is no transmission data from the BS. In this case, the MSS updates<br>
the sleep interval by increasing the sleep interval using an initial-sleep window<br>
value and a final-sleep window value.<br>
The initial-sleep window value is an initial minimum value of the sleep<br>
interval, and the final-sleep window value is a final maximum value of the sleep<br>
interval. In addition, the initial-sleep window value and the final-sleep window<br>
value can be represented by a number of frames, and both are allocated by the BS.<br><br>
A more detailed description of the initial-sleep window value and the final-sleep<br>
window value will be made herein below.<br>
(3) Listening Interval<br>
The listening interval is a parameter existing in a registration response<br>
(REG-RSP) message transmitted from the BS to the MSS in response to a<br>
registration request (REG-REQ) message transmitted from the MSS to the BS in<br>
a Registration process of the MSS. The listening interval represents a time<br>
interval for which the MSS awakes from the sleep mode for a while and receives<br>
downlink messages such as a traffic indication (TRF_IND) message in<br>
synchronism with a downlink signal from the BS.<br>
The traffic indication message indicates the presence of a traffic message,<br>
or packet data, to be transmitted to the MSS, and a detailed description thereof<br>
will be made below. That is, the MSS continuously waits for the traffic indication<br>
message for the listening interval, and if a Basic CID designating the MSS exists<br>
in the traffic indication message (Positive Basic CID), the MSS continuously<br>
maintains the awake mode, state transitioning to the awake mode. However, if the<br>
listening interval expires while no Basic CID designating the MSS exists in the<br>
received traffic indication messages (Negative Basic CID), the MSS state<br>
transitions to the sleep mode.<br>
(4) Sleep Interval Update Algorithm<br>
After a state transition to the sleep mode, the MSS determines a sleep<br>
interval, regarding a predetermined initial-sleep window value as a minimum<br>
sleep mode period. After expiration of the sleep interval, the MSS awakes from<br>
the sleep mode, and then state transitions to the listening interval. For the<br>
listening interval, the MSS continuously determines whether there is packet data<br>
to be transmitted from the BS. If it is determined that there is no transmission<br>
packet data for the listening interval, the MSS doubles the sleep interval and<br>
returns to the sleep mode.<br>
More specifically, for example, if the initial-sleep window value is '2',<br>
the MSS sets the sleep interval to 2 frames and remains in the sleep mode during<br>
the 2 frames. After expiration of the 2 frames, the MSS awakes from the sleep<br>
mode and determines if the traffic indication message is received from the BS.<br>
If it is received the traffic indication message for the listening interval,<br><br>
the MSS determines if a Basic CID exists in the received traffic indication<br>
message. If it is determined that the Basic CID does not exist in the received<br>
traffic indication message, the MSS sets the sleep interval to 4 frames, i.e.,<br>
doubles the sleep interval, and remains in the sleep mode during the 4 frames.<br>
Accordingly, the sleep interval increases from the initial-sleep window<br>
value to the final-sleep window value, and such an update algorithm is called the<br>
Sleep Interval Update Algorithm.<br>
Below, a description will now be made of messages currently defined in<br>
the IEEE 802.16e communication system for supporting the sleep mode operation<br>
and the awake mode operation described above.<br>
(1) Sleep Request (SLP-REQ) Message<br>
The Sleep Request message is transmitted from an MSS to a BS, and is<br>
used by the MSS to request a state transition to the sleep mode. The Sleep<br>
Request message includes parameters, or information elements (IEs), required by<br>
the MSS to operate in the sleep mode. A format of the Sleep Request message is<br>
illustrated in Table 2.<br><br>
The Sleep Request message is a dedicated message transmitted to the<br>
BSaccording to information identified by the Basic CID of the MSS. The<br>
information elements of the Sleep Request message illustrated in Table 2 will be<br>
described below.<br>
Management Message Type is information indicating a type of a current<br>
transmission message, and Management Message Type=45 represents the Sleep<br>
Request message.<br>
An Initial-Sleep Window value represents a start value requested for the<br>
sleep interval (measured in frames), and a Final-Sleep Window value represents a<br><br>
stop value requested for the sleep interval (measured in frames). That is, as<br>
described with reference to the Sleep Interval Update Algorithm, the sleep<br>
interval can be updated within a range between the Initial-Sleep Window value<br>
and the Final-Sleep Window value.<br>
Herein, the listening interval represents a requested listening interval<br>
(measured in frames). The listening interval can also be represented by the<br>
number of frames.<br>
(2) Sleep Response (SLP RSP) Message<br>
The Sleep Response message is a message responsive to the Sleep<br>
Request message. The Sleep Response message can be used as a message<br>
indicating whether to approve a state transition request to the sleep mode from the<br>
MSS, or can be used as a message indicating an unsolicited instruction. The Sleep<br>
Response message includes information elements required by the MSS to operate<br>
in the sleep mode. A format of the Sleep Response message is illustrated in Table<br>
3.<br><br>
The Sleep Response message is also a dedicated message transmitted to<br>
the BSaccording to information identified by the Basic CID of a MSS. The<br><br>
information elements of the Sleep Response message illustrated in Table 3 will be<br>
described below.<br>
Management Message Type is information indicating a type of a current<br>
transmission message, and Management Message Type=46 represents the Sleep<br>
Response message.<br>
A Sleep-Approved value is expressed with 1 bit. Sleep-Approved value=0<br>
indicates that a state transition request to the sleep mode is defined (Sleep-Mode<br>
Request Denied), and Sleep-Approved value=l indicates that a state transition<br>
request to the sleep mode is approved (Sleep-Mode Requested Approved). That is,<br>
Sleep-Approved value=0 indicates that a state transition request to the sleep mode<br>
by the MSS is denied. In this case, the denied MSS transmits a Sleep Request<br>
message to the BS according to a condition, or waits for a Sleep Response<br>
message indicating an unsolicited instruction from the BS. For Sleep-Approved<br>
value=l, the Sleep Response message includes a Start-Frame value, an Initial-<br>
Sleep Window value, and a Final-Sleep Window value. For Sleep-Approved<br>
value=0, the Sleep Response message includes a Request-Action (REQ-Action)<br>
value and a Request-Duration (REQ-Duration) value.<br>
The Start-Frame value is a frame value until the MSS enters a first sleep<br>
interval, excluding the frame in which the Sleep Response message has been<br>
received. That is, the MSS state transitions to the sleep mode after expiration of<br>
the frames corresponding to the start frame value from the next frame of the<br>
frame where the Sleep Response message has been received.<br>
 As described above, the Initial-Sleep Window value represents a start<br>
value for the sleep interval (measured in frames), and the Final-Sleep Window<br>
value represents a stop value for the sleep interval (measured in frames). The<br>
REQ-Action value represents an action that should be taken by the MSS, a<br>
transition request to the sleep mode from which was defined.<br>
(3) Traffic Indication (TRF IND) message<br>
The traffic indication message is transmitted from a BS to a MSS during<br>
the listening interval, and indicates the presence of packet data to be transmitted<br>
from the BS to the MSS. A format of the traffic indication message is illustrated<br>
in Table 4.<br><br><br>
The traffic indication message, unlike the Sleep Request message and<br>
Sleep Response message, is a broadcasting message that is transmitted on a<br>
broadcasting basis. In addition, the traffic indication message is a message<br>
indicating the presence of packet data to be transmitted from the BS to a<br>
particular MSS, and the MSS determines if it will state transition to the awake<br>
mode or remain in the sleep mode after decoding the broadcasted traffic<br>
indication message for the listening interval.<br>
If the MSS state transitions to the awake mode, the MSS detects frame<br>
synchronization. If an expected frame sequence number is not detected, the MSS<br>
can request retransmission of lost packet data in the awake mode. However, if the<br>
MSS fails to receive the traffic indication message for the listening interval or a<br>
positive indication is not included in the traffic indication message even though<br>
the traffic indication message is received, the MSS returns to the sleep mode.<br>
A description will now be made of information elements of the traffic<br>
indication message illustrated in Table 4.<br>
Management Message Type is information indicating a type of a current<br>
transmission message, and Management Message Type=47 represents the traffic<br>
indication message. Positive_Indication_List includes Num-Positive indicating<br>
the number of positive subscribers and CIDs of the positive subscribers. That is,<br>
the Positive_Indication_List represents the number of MSSs to which packet data<br>
is to be transmitted, and CIDs thereof.<br>
transitioning FIG. 3 is a signaling diagram illustrating a process of<br><br>
state transitioning to an awake mode by a MSS under the control of a BS in the<br>
IEEE 802.16e communication system. Referring to FIG. 3, an MSS 300 arrives at<br>
a listening interval at Step 311. If there is traffic, or packet data, to be transmitted<br>
to the MSS 300, a BS 350 buffers the packet data, and transmits a traffic<br>
indication message to the MSS 300 at Step 313.<br>
Here, the traffic indication message includes the information elements<br>
described in connection with Table 4. The MSS 300 receiving the traffic<br>
indication message from the BS 350 determines if there is the positive indication<br>
in the traffic indication message. If there is the positive indication, the MSS 300<br>
reads a Basic CID included in the traffic indication message and determines if its<br>
own Basic CID is included in the traffic indication message. If it is determined<br>
that its own Basic CID is included in the traffic indication message, the MSS 300<br>
state transitions from the current mode, i.e., the sleep mode, to the awake mode at<br>
Step 315.<br>
FIG. 4 is a signaling diagram illustrating a process of state transitioning to<br>
a sleep mode and maintaining the sleep mode by an MSS under the control of a<br>
BS in the IEEE 802.16e communication system. In FIG. 4, the MSS receives the<br>
traffic indication message for the listening interval, and then returns to the sleep<br>
mode according to a condition. In this case, if there is downlink traffic to be<br>
transmitted to several MSSs in the sleep mode state, the BS buffers the traffic for<br>
the MSSs, and includes Basic CIDs designating the corresponding MSSs in a<br>
periodically transmitted BS traffic indication message, before transmission on a<br>
broadcasting.basis when the MSSs arrive at the listening interval.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, if a MSS 400 awaken in a listening interval 411 at<br>
Step 411, and receives a traffic indication message from a BS 450 at Step 413, the<br>
MSS 400 determines if its own Basic CID is included in the received traffic<br>
indication message. Here, because the MSS 400 fails to detect its own Basic CID<br>
from the BS traffic indication message, the MSS 400 continuously determines for<br>
the listening interval if its own Basic CID is included in received BS traffic<br>
indication messages 415 and 417. The MSS 400 continuously repeats the above<br>
process for the listening interval. If the MSS 400 stays in the Negative Basic CID<br>
state until the listening interval expires at Step 419, the MSS 400 returns to the<br>
sleep mode at Step 421.<br>
As described above, the MSS 400 maintains the sleep mode for a doubled<br><br>
sleep interval, and then repeats the above process when it arrives again at the<br>
listening interval. However, if the MSS 400 detects a Positive Basic CID, the<br>
MSS 400 state transitions to the awake mode as described in connection with FIG.<br>
3.<br>
FIG. 5 is a diagram illustrating an operation of updating a sleep<br>
interval in a sleep mode by an MSS under the control of a BS in the IEEE<br>
802.16e communication system. In FIG. 5, an MSS 570 receives a traffic<br>
indication messages transmitted by a BS 501 on a broadcasting basis for listening<br>
intervals 543, 547, and 551, and when Negative Basic CIDs 519, 529, and 539 are<br>
included in the received traffic indication messages, the MSS 570 doubles the<br>
sleep intervals 541, 545, and 549, and then returns to the sleep mode. If the MSS<br>
570 detects a Positive Basic CID for the listening intervals 543, 547, and 551, the<br>
MSS 570 state transitions to the awake mode as described in conjunction with<br>
FIG. 3.<br>
A format of the traffic indication message transmitted by the BS on a<br>
broadcasting basis to allow the MSS to make a state transition to the awake mode<br>
for the listening interval is illustrated in FIG. 6. FIG. 6 is a diagram illustrating a<br>
format of a traffic indication message transmitted from a BS to a MSS in the<br>
IEEE 802.16e communication system. Referring to FIG. 6, a traffic indication<br>
message 600 includes MAG frame header parts 611 and 613 indicating that a<br>
corresponding transmission message is a traffic indication message, and traffic<br>
indication index parts 615, 617, and 619 indicating the contents of an actual<br>
traffic indication message.<br>
The MAC frame header parts 611 and 613 include a Management<br>
Message Type field 611 indicating a type of the transmission message and a Num-<br>
of-Positive field 613 indicating a length of a traffic indication message. Herein,<br>
because the message is a traffic indication message, a value of 47 is stored in the<br>
Management Message Type field 611.<br>
To enable three MSSs to simultaneously state transition to the awake<br>
mode through the traffic indication message 600, it is necessary to make CIDs for<br>
the three MSSs with traffic indication indexes. Therefore, in order to instruct the<br>
three MSSs to make a state transition to the awake mode, a value of 3 is stored in<br>
the Num-of-Positive field 613 and Basic CIDs for the three MSSs are included in<br>
the next fields before being transmitted. For example, in order to instruct first to<br><br>
third MSSs (MSS#1, MSS#2, and MSS#3) 621, 623, and 625 to state transition to<br>
the awake mode, Basic CIDs 615, 617, and 619 for the MSSs should be stored.<br>
Because the Basic CID includes 16 bits, or 2 bytes, a 6-byte data field is needed<br>
to instruct three MSSs to state transition to the awake mode.<br>
As described above, the traffic indication message 600 is a broadcasting<br>
message, and all MSSs in their listening interval among the MSSs belonging to a<br>
particular BS receive the traffic indication message 600. The MSSs determine if<br>
their own Basic CIDs are included in the traffic indication message 600, to<br>
thereby determine whether they will maintain the sleep mode or make a state<br>
transition to the awake mode.<br>
Above, a description has been made of the sleep mode operations<br>
proposed in the current IEEE 802.16e communication system. Next, a description<br>
will be made of problems of the sleep mode operations.<br>
(1) In the IEEE 802.16e communication system, if there is traffic to be<br>
transmitted to MSSs in the sleep mode, the BS includes 16-bit Basic CIDs<br>
designating the corresponding MSSs in the traffic indication message as described<br>
above. However, a range of Basic CIDs designating MSSs in one BS occupies a<br>
very small part of CID#1 to CID#m among a total of 65536 CIDs. Therefore, 16-<br>
bit-CIDs necessary for identifying MSSs include unnecessary most significant<br>
bits (MSBs).<br>
As the number of MSSs that can be managed by the BS increases, the<br>
number of Basic CIDs that can be included in the traffic indication message in the<br>
above-described method also increases according thereto. For example, if the<br>
number of MSSs that can be managed by one BS is 30, only 5 bits are needed in<br>
indicating all of the MSSs. However, the conventional IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system uses 16-bit CIDs as usual. For this, the traffic indication<br>
message needs a Basic CID group of a maximum of 60 bytes (30x2 bytes), or 480<br>
bits.<br>
In addition, the IEEE 802.16e communication system needs a specific<br>
bandwidth in order to transmit a traffic indication message to the MSSs, and as<br>
the number of MSSs that can be managed by one BS increases, the maximum size<br>
of the traffic indication message also increases according thereto, causing an<br>
increase in the bandwidth in use. Therefore, in order to minimize an influence on<br><br>
the bandwidth for transmitting data traffic, Basic CIDs for enabling the MSSs in<br>
the sleep mode to make a state transition to the awake mode are separately<br>
transmitted with several traffic indication messages. As a result, the listening<br>
interval for which the MSS receives the traffic indication message is also<br>
increased, causing unnecessary power consumption.<br>
(2) In the IEEE 802.16e communication system, a MSS in the sleep mode<br>
awakes for the listening interval and repeats a process of waiting for a traffic<br>
indication message transmitted by the BS and determining if there is a Basic CID<br>
indicating the MSS in the traffic indication message. That is, if the MSS fails to<br>
receive a traffic indication message for the listening interval or there is no Basic<br>
CID in the traffic indication message even though the traffic indication message<br>
is received, the MSS continues to perform the above process. Therefore, the BS<br>
is not required to compel even the MSS remaining in the listening interval to<br>
make a state transition to the awake mode based on service scheduling for<br>
which load balancing on all MSSs is taken into consideration. However, an MSS,<br>
which is not informed about the situation, waits for a traffic indication message,<br>
continuously and unnecessarily wasting its power until expiration of the listening<br>
interval. Accordingly, there is a demand for various algorithms for directing the<br>
MSS to return to the sleep mode before expiration of the listening interval,<br>
thereby minimizing power consumption.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Several preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described in<br>
detail herein below with reference to the annexed drawings. In the following<br>
description, a detailed description of known functions and configurations<br>
incorporated herein has been omitted for conciseness.<br>
The present invention provides system and method for making an efficient traffic<br>
indication message for directing an MSS in a sleep mode to state transition to an<br>
awake mode, thereby reducing unnecessary data transmission and performing<br>
effective (node control on the MSS.<br>
As descriped above, because the IEEE 802.16e communication system should<br>
consider mobility of subscriber stations in the IEEE 802.16a<br><br>
communication system, power consumption of the MSSs is an important factor of<br>
the entire system. Therefore, a sleep mode operation and an awake mode<br>
operation between the BS and the MSSs have been proposed to minimize the<br>
power consumption of the MSSs. However, because the sleep mode operation<br>
and the awake mode operation proposed in the current IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system have the problems described above, the present<br>
invention proposes embodiments for solving the above and other problems.<br>
First Embodiment<br>
A traffic indication message generation system and method according to a first<br>
embodiment of the present invention maps of Basic CIDs designating MSSs to<br>
traffic indication indexes with a bitmap structure. That is, the traffic indication<br>
message generation method according to the first embodiment is a first method<br>
for reducing a size of the traffic indication message, and proposes a method of<br>
using traffic indication indexes with a bitmap structure instead of the Basic CIDs<br>
designating the MSSs.<br>
Therefore, the first embodiment of the present invention proposes a system and<br>
method for mapping traffic indication indexes with a bitmap structure instead of<br>
a series of 16-bit Basic CIDs, used in a traffic indication message.<br><br>
The traffic indication message includes parameters, or information elements<br>
(IEs), configured in a bitmap structure, based on which the MSS should<br>
determine for its listening interval whether the BS has traffic to be transmitted to<br>
the corresponding MSS. A format of the traffic indication message is illustrated in<br><br><br>
Referring to Table 5, the traffic indication message according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention is similar in format to the traffic indication<br>
message illustrated in Table 4. However, the new traffic indication message has a<br>
series of traffic indication indexes with a bitmap structure instead of a series of<br>
16-bit Basic CIDs. The Basic CID described above is a CID designating an MSS,<br>
and uses a value ranging between 1 and m. A mapping relation between the Basic<br>
CIDs described in connection with Table 1 and bit indexes newly proposed in the<br>
present invention is illustrated in Table 6.<br><br>
In Table 6, 'm', which indicates the maximum number of Basic CIDs<br>
allocated by the BS, represents the number of MSSs that the BS can support.<br>
For example, an MSS using a Basic CID of 'n' is mapped to an nth bit in a<br>
continuous traffic indication index, or a parameter, in the traffic indication<br>
message. That is, the MSS with a Basic CID=1 is mapped to a first bit in the<br>
traffic indication index in Table 5, and an MSS with a Basic CID=12 is mapped to<br>
a 12 bit in a continuous 2-byte traffic indication index.<br>
Information elements of the traffic indication message illustrated in Table<br>
5 will be described herein below. Management Message Type is identical to the<br>
Management Message Type described in connection with Table 4. Therefore, a<br>
detailed description thereof will be omitted. The newly defined information<br>
elements of Num_of_MSS_Group and Trafficlndicationlndex will be described.<br>
The Num_of_MSS_Group, a first parameter, which denotes the number<br>
of groups, each having 8 MSSs, and has a different input value according to the<br>
maximum number of MSSs supported by the BS. That is, because a range of the<br>
Num_of_MSS_Group includes one byte, it is possible to make a maximum of 255<br>
MSS groups. Accordingly, it is possible to support a maximum of 2040 (=255<br><br>
MSS groups x 8 MSSs) MSSs. Because it is possible to include a maximum of<br>
2040 MSSs with one byte as described above, it is possible to efficiently make a<br>
traffic indication message.<br><br>
If the maximum number of MSSs that can be managed by the BS is 20,<br>
the Num_of_MSS_Group included in a traffic indication message transmitted<br>
from the BS to the MSS becomes 3, considering a traffic indication index<br>
comprised of a bit field for 20 MSSs. Here, '3' is the number of groups capable of<br>
including 20 MSSs to accommodate a maximum of 24 MSSs by taking 3 times of<br>
8 MSSs.<br>
The Traffic_Indication_Index, a second parameter, is used to allocate one<br>
bit to each MSS, i.e., allocate one Traffic_Indication_Index bit to a Basic CID<br>
used for identifying a MSS such that corresponding MSSs awaken from the sleep<br>
mode for the listening interval determine if there is traffic to be received from the<br>
BS, based on the allocated bits.<br>
Possible values of the Traffic_Indication_Index bit analyzed by the MSS<br>
are as follows.<br>
- '0': This bit value indicates that the BS has no data to be transmitted to<br>
a corresponding MSS awaken for the listening interval after expiration of the<br>
sleep interval. The MSS detecting this bit value should repeat a process of<br>
analyzing a corresponding bit while continuously waiting for a traffic indication<br>
message for the listening interval.<br>
In addition, because this bit is a meaningless bit for an MSS in the sleep<br>
mode or the awake mode remaining in the sleep interval, i.e., because the<br>
corresponding MSSs do not decode a received traffic indication message, this bit<br>
is set to '0' before being transmitted. That is, the traffic indication message<br>
considers only an MSS in a sleep mode that determines if there is traffic from the<br>
BS, for the listening interval. Accordingly, it can be understood that the traffic<br>
indication message is identical in operation to the traffic indication message used<br><br>
in the sleep mode in the conventional IEEE 802.16e communication system.<br>
Finally, because a bit not allocated to the MSS, i.e., a bit other than the bits<br>
allocated to the MSSs that can be supported by the BS, is meaningless, it is set to<br>
'0'.<br>
- T: This bit value indicates that the BS has data to be transmitted to a<br>
corresponding MSS awaked for the listening interval after expiration of the sleep<br>
interval. The MSS detecting this bit value should make a state transition to the<br>
awake mode and prepare to receive the traffic transmitted by the BS.<br>
As a result, by using the traffic indication message proposed in Table 5, it<br>
is possible to support the same number of MSSs with data much less than the<br>
traffic indication message used in the conventional IEEE 802.16e communication<br>
system. For example, in Table 7, a comparison is made between the traffic<br>
indication message used in the conventional IEEE 802.16e communication<br>
system and the traffic indication message proposed in the present invention in<br>
terms of the amount of data needed according to the number of MSSs supported<br>
by the BS.<br><br>
As illustrated in Table 7, it can be understood that as the number of MSSs<br>
supported by the BS increases, the traffic indication message proposed in Table 5<br><br>
can perform the same function with data much less than the existing traffic<br>
indication message, for the data necessary for compelling a MSS in the listening<br>
interval to make a state transition to the awake mode.<br>
FIG. 7 is a diagram illustrating a traffic indication message transmitted<br>
from a BS to MSSs in the IEEE 802.16e communication system according to a<br>
first embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 7, a corresponding<br>
traffic indication (MOB_TRF_IND) message 700 includes parameters of<br>
Management Message Type 711, Num_of_MSS_Group 713, and<br>
Traffic_Indication_Indexes 715 and 717. However, before a detailed description<br>
of FIG. 7 is given, it will be assumed herein that the maximum number of MSSs<br>
that can be managed by the BS is 14. Therefore, it is assumed that the MSSs have<br>
been allocated the Basic CIDs described above from 1 to 14. In addition, it is<br>
assumed that MSSs having 1, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, and 13 as the Basic CIDs are staying<br>
in their listening intervals, and thus are waiting for the traffic indication message<br>
transmitted from the BS on a broadcasting basis.<br>
In FIG. 7, the Management Message Type 711 indicates that the<br>
transmission message is a traffic indication message 700, and. the<br>
Num_of_MSS_Group 713 is set to '2' in order to allow the BS to accommodate<br>
14 MSSs according to the assumptions stated above. Therefore, two consecutive<br>
Traffic_Indication_mdexes 715 and 717 are used, and their respective bits are<br>
allocated to MSSs having 1 to 14 as the Basic CIDs on a one-to-one basis. On this<br>
assumption, because MSSs 719, 725, 727, 731, 735, 737, and 743 having 1, 4, 5,<br>
7, 9, 10, and 13 as Basic CIDs, respectively, among all MSSs are staying in the<br>
listening interval, they wait for the traffic indication message 700. The MSSs 719,<br>
725, 727, 731, 735, 737, and 743 read corresponding bit values from the<br>
Traffic_Indication_Indexes of the received traffic indication message.<br>
For example, the MSS 719 having a Basic CID of 1 reads a value of an<br>
allocated first bit from the Traffic_Indication_Index 715. In this case, because the<br>
corresponding bit value is '1', the MSS 719 state transitions to the awake mode<br>
and receives traffic transmitted from the BS. Unlike this, the MSS 737 having a<br>
Basic CID of 10 reads a value of 10th bit from the Trafficlndicationjndex 717.<br>
In this case, because the corresponding bit value is '0', the MSS 737 continuously<br>
waits for the traffic indication message 700 for the remaining listening interval,<br>
determining that there is data to be transmitted from the BS.<br><br>
In FIG. 7, reference numerals 721,723,729,733,739,741, and 745 represent<br>
absence of corresponding bits because the corresponding MSSs are in the awake<br>
mode or the sleep mode and have no data to be transmitted to the BS, as<br>
described with reference to the '0' -bit value in the Traffic_Indication_Index. In<br>
addition, reference numerals 747 and 749 represent meaningless bits set to x0'<br>
because they do not fall within a range of the number of MSSs that can be<br>
managed by the BS.<br>
In FIG. 7, in order to direct the MSSs 719, 725,727,735, and 743 having Basic<br>
CIDs of 1,4,5,9, and 13 to make a state transition to the awake mode for the<br>
listening interval, the traffic indication message proposed in the present<br>
invention has a size of a total of 4 bytes. However, in order to transmit a traffic<br>
indication message in the sleep mode in the conventional IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system, it is necessary to group corresponding Basic CIDs<br>
1,4,5,9, and 13 of 16 bits (i.e., 2 bytes) and insert them into the traffic indication<br>
message. Therefore, a total of 12 (=1+1+2*5) bytes are needed. As a result, it<br>
is easy to control MSSs in the sleep mode at a time using the traffic indication<br>
message 700 proposed in the present invention.<br><br>
With reference to FIG. 7, a description has been made of an operation of state<br>
transitioning to the awake mode or continuously waiting for a traffic indication<br>
message by a corresponding MSS for the listening interval using the traffic<br>
indication message proposed in the present invention.<br>
In the first embodiment of the present invention, when there is no traffic for an<br>
MSS in a listening interval, the traffic indication message for traffic transmission<br>
in the conventional IEEE 802.16e communication system is comprised of 2 bytes<br>
by setting Num-Positive (indicating the number of positive subscribers) illustrated<br>
in Table 4 to '0'. However, in the present invention, because<br>
Traffic_Indication_Indexes having bits for all MSSs are always included, as the<br>
number of MSSs managed by the BS increases, a traffic indication message<br>
longer than the conventional traffic indication message can be transmitted to the<br>
MSSs. In order to solve this problem, the present invention can use the following<br>
modified method to use a traffic indication message having a dynamically<br>
variable length instead of a traffic indication message with a fixed size.<br>
When the BS has no traffic to be transmitted to all corresponding MSSs<br><br>
in the listening interval, the BS sets the Num_of_MSS_Group to '0' and transmits<br>
the traffic indication message with no Traffic_Indication_Indexes attached to and<br>
end thereof. The corresponding MSS receiving the traffic indication message<br>
determines if there is a bit designating the MSS itself in the<br>
Traffic_Indication_Indexes, using the Num_of_MSS_Group. If there is no bit<br>
designating the MSS itself, the MSS determines that there is no data to be<br>
received. That is, as described above, the MSS waits for the next traffic indication<br>
message until expiration of the listening interval, determining that a bit allocated<br>
to the Traffic_Indication_Indexs for the corresponding MSS is '0'.<br>
The BS determines a Basic CID having the largest value among<br>
corresponding MSSs to be directed to state transition to the awake mode in a<br>
frame interval for which a traffic indication message will be transmitted, i.e., the<br>
corresponding listening interval. Thereafter, the BS sets the Basic CID to the<br>
Num_of_MSS_Group value including the Traffic_Indication_Index bits mapped<br>
on a one-to-one basis. Thereafter, the BS generates a traffic indication message by<br>
attaching thereto Traffic_Indication_Indexes in a bitmap format having a size<br>
corresponding to the Num_of_MSS_Group. For the Traffic_Indication_Indexes,<br>
the BS sets a bit designating a Basic CID of a corresponding MSS to be directed<br>
to state transition to the awake mode, to '1'. Thereafter, the BS transmits the<br>
generated traffic indication message to the MSS remaining in the listening<br>
interval on a broadcasting basis.<br>
The corresponding MSS receiving the traffic indication message<br>
determines if there is a bit designating Jhe MSS itself in the<br>
Traffic_Indication_Indexes, using the Num_of_MSS_Group. If there is no bit<br>
designating the MSS itself, the MSS determines that there is no data to be<br>
received. That is, as described above, the MSS waits for the next traffic indication<br>
message until expiration of the listening interval, determining that a bit allocated<br>
to the Traffic_Indication_Indexes for the corresponding MSS is '0'. However, if<br>
the corresponding bit exists, the MSS operates in the method described with<br>
reference to the traffic indication message with a fixed length.<br>
In order to use a traffic indication message having a dynamically variable<br>
length, for the Traffic_Indication_Indexes with a bitmap structure of the traffic<br>
indication message, the MSS is mapped to a Basic CID allocated from the BS on<br>
a one-to-one basis as described above. Therefore, in order to minimize a size of<br>
the traffic indication message, it is preferable for the BS to sequentially allocate<br><br>
Basic CIDs to the MSSs.<br>
FIG. 8 is a flowchart illustrating a process of state transitioning by a MSS<br>
upon receiving a traffic indication message according to a first embodiment of the<br>
present invention. Referring to FIG. 8, an MSS is in a sleep mode at step 811. In<br>
step 813, the MSS determines if it is in a sleep interval, i.e., whether it should<br>
remain in the sleep mode. If it is determined that the sleep interval has expired,<br>
the MSS proceeds to step 815. However, if it is determined that the sleep interval<br>
has not ended, the MSS returns to step 813.<br>
In step 815, the MSS determines if it is in a listening interval, i.e.,<br>
whether the listening interval has expired. If it is determined that the listening<br>
interval has expired, the MSS proceeds to step 823 where it state transitions to the<br>
sleep mode. However, if it is determined in step 815 that the listening interval has<br>
not expired, the MSS proceeds to step 817.<br>
In step 817, the MSS determines if a traffic indication message is<br>
received from a BS for the listening interval. If it is determined that a traffic<br>
indication message is received, the MSS proceeds to step 819. However, if it is<br>
determined in step 817 that no traffic indication message is received, the MSS<br>
returns to step 815.<br>
In step 819, the MSS determines if there is a Traffic_Indication_Index bit<br>
described with reference to Table 6, being mapped to its own Basic CID, based on<br>
Num_of_MSS_Group included in the received traffic indication message. This<br>
means that the traffic indication message can have a variable traffic indication<br>
index. If it is determined that there is a corresponding Traffic_Indication_Index<br>
bit, the MSS proceeds to step 821. However, if it is determined in step 819 that<br>
there is no corresponding Trafficlndicationlndex bit, the MSS returns to step<br>
815, considering that no traffic indication message is received.<br>
In step 821, the MSS analyzes a Trafficlndicationlndex bit. If it is<br>
determined that the Traffic_Indication_Index bit is ' 1', the MSS proceeds to step<br>
825 where it state transitions to the awake mode, determining that the BS has data<br>
to be transmitted to the MSS for the listening interval.<br>
However, if it is determined in step 821 that the Trafficlndicationlndex<br>
bit is not '1', the MSS returns to step 815, determining that the BS has no data<br><br>
traffic for the corresponding MSS for the listening interval.<br>
With reference to FIG. 8, a description has been made of a procedure in which<br>
the MSS state transitions to the awake mode, waits for a traffic indication<br>
message, or state transitions to the sleep mode for the listening interval, using<br>
the traffic indication message proposed in the present invention.<br>
The first embodiment has proposed for mapping a Basic CID allocated to the<br>
MSS to one bit in a traffic indication index with a bitmap structure on a one-to-<br>
one basis as a method for reducing a size of the traffic indication message. Next,<br>
a system and method according to a second embodiment of the present<br>
invention will be described.<br>
Second Embodiment<br>
A second embodiment of the present invention provides a system and method of<br>
using a Sleep ID (SLPID) designating an MSS in the sleep mode instead of a<br>
Basic CID of a traffic indication message used in the IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system.<br>
Conventionally, in order to direct an MSS operating in the sleep mode to state<br>
transition to the awake mode, the BS includes a Basic CID of the MSS in a traffic<br>
indication message. However, the second embodiment of the present invention<br>
proposes a method for identifying the MSS operating in the sleep mode using a<br>
newly defined Sleep ID instead of the Basic CID included in the traffic indication<br>
message.<br>
The second embodiment of the present invention newly defines the Sleep<br>
Response message of Table 3 and the traffic indication message of Table 4. A<br>
Sleep Response message newly defined in the second embodiment of the<br>
present invention is illustrated in Table 8.<br><br><br>
Referring to Table 8, the Sleep Response message proposed in the second<br>
embodiment is identical to the Sleep Response message illustrated in Table 3 in<br>
constituent parameters except the newly defined Sleep ID. Therefore, only the<br>
Sleep ID will be described herein, and a description of the other parameters will<br>
be omitted.<br>
The Sleep ID is allocated through the Sleep Response message in a<br>
process in which the MSS state transitions to the sleep mode. The Sleep ID is<br>
uniquely used only for the MSSs operating in the sleep mode. That is, the Sleep<br>
ID is an ID used for identifying a MSS in the sleep mode state including the<br>
listening interval, and if the corresponding MSS state transitions to the awake<br>
mode, the Sleep ID in use is returned to the BS so that the Sleep ID can be reused<br>
by another MSSs desiring to make a state transition to the sleep mode, using the<br>
Sleep Response message illustrated in Table 8. The Sleep ID, when it has 8 bits,<br>
has a value ranging between 0 and 255. Therefore, the Sleep ID can support a<br>
maximum of 256 MSSs in sleep mode operation.<br>
The traffic indication message according to the second embodiment of the<br>
present invention is illustrated in Table 9.<br><br><br>
Referring to Table 9, the traffic indication message according to the<br>
second embodiment of the present invention is identical to the traffic indication<br>
message illustrated in Table 4 in constituent parameters, except for the newly<br>
defined Sleep IE). That is, the Sleep ID can be used instead of the Basic CID<br>
illustrated in Table 4. Therefore, a description of the parameters other than the<br>
Sleep ID will be omitted.<br>
The Sleep ID is: allocated to the MSS by the BS using the Sleep Response<br>
message of Table 8, and it is used in identifying only the MSS operating in the<br>
sleep mode as described with reference to Table 8. Although the Sleep ID, like the<br>
Basic CID of Table 4, is used for designating the MSS, the use of the Sleep ID is<br>
limited only to the MSS operating in the' sleep mode. That is, the Sleep ID is<br>
allocated by the BS only to the MSS that state transitions to the sleep mode as<br>
described above. Therefore, the traffic indication message of Table 9 includes<br>
only a Sleep ID designating an MSS to be directed to state transition to the awake<br>
mode during the listening interval among the MSSs operating in the sleep mode.<br>
Therefore, the Sleep ID included in the traffic indication message of<br>
Table 9 can be shorter in length than the Basic CID used in Table 4. For example,<br>
in Table 9, the Sleep ID has an 8-bit length, which is a half the size. Therefore, the<br>
proposed traffic indication message is two times higher in efficiency than the<br>
existing traffic indication message. That is, assuming the traffic indication<br>
messages have the same length, the traffic indication message proposed in the<br>
present invention is twice as large as the existing traffic indication message in<br>
number of IDs for the MSSs.<br>
The entire sleep mode operation through the two messages described in<br>
connection with Table 8 and Table 9 is identical to the sleep mode operation in the<br><br>
conventional IEEE 802.16e communication system. However, in the second<br>
embodiment of the present invention, because an 8-bit Sleep ID for identifying<br>
only an MSS operating in the sleep mode is allocated to the conventional Sleep<br>
Response message transmitted to the MSS in the awake mode, the proposed Sleep<br>
Response message is twice as efficient in a message length than the conventional<br>
Sleep Response message.<br>
An MSS allocated the Sleep ID, i.e., a MSS operating in the sleep mode,<br>
uses the corresponding Sleep ID over the sleep interval until it state transitions<br>
back to the awake mode.<br>
The Sleep ID used by the MSS operating in the sleep mode is returned to<br>
the BS according to the following three events.<br>
1)	The Sleep ID is returned to the BS, when predetermined user data is<br>
first received from the MSS after directing the MSS in sleep mode operation to<br>
make a state transition to the awake mode through a traffic indication message<br>
from the BS for the listening interval.<br>
2)	The Sleep ID is returned to the BS, when a Bandwidth Request<br>
message for transmitting user data is transmitted from the MSS in sleep mode<br>
operation for the sleep interval.<br>
3)	The Sleep ID is returned to the BS, when an unexpected message is<br>
transmitted from the MSS in sleep mode operation for the sleep interval.<br>
In a sleep mode operation in the IEEE 802.16e communication system, if<br>
the BS receives data from the MSS considering synchronization of sleep<br>
mode/awake mode states between the MSS and the BS, the Sleep ID allocated to<br>
the corresponding MSS in sleep mode operation is returned to be reused in the<br>
future.<br>
FIG. 9 is a signaling diagram illustrating a process of state transitioning to<br>
the sleep mode in response to a request from an MSS according to the second<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 9, an MSS 900 is in the<br>
awake mode in step 911. If the MSS 900 desires to state transition to the sleep<br>
mode, it transmits a Sleep Request (SLP_REQ) message to a BS 950 in step 913.<br>
The BS 950 receiving the Sleep Request message from the MSS 900 determines<br><br>
whether to approve a state transition to the sleep mode of the MSS 900, based on<br>
situations of the MSS 900 and the BS 950. Based on the determination result, the<br>
BS 950 transmits a Sleep Response (SLP_RSP) message to the MSS 900 at Step<br>
915. Here, the Sleep Response message includes the information elements<br>
described in connection with Table 8, and further includes a Sleep ID (SLPID)<br>
uniquely used by the MSS in the sleep mode according to the second embodiment<br>
of the present invention.<br>
Herein, the BS 950 determines whether to approve a state transition to the<br>
sleep mode of the MSS 900, based on whether there is packet data to be<br>
transmitted to the MSS 900. As illustrated in Table 8, the BS 950 sets Sleep-<br>
Approved to ' 1' to approve the state transition to the sleep mode, and sets Sleep-<br>
Approved to '0' to deny the state transition to the sleep mode. The information<br>
elements included in the Sleep Response message have been described with<br>
reference to Table 8.<br>
Subsequently, the MSS 900 receiving the Sleep Response message from<br>
the BS 950 analyzes a Sleep-Approved value included in the Sleep Response<br>
message, and state transitions to the sleep mode if the state transition to the sleep<br>
mode is approved at Step 917. As the MSS 900 state transitions to the sleep mode,<br>
it can perform a sleep mode operation by reading corresponding information<br>
elements from the Sleep Response message.<br>
According to the second embodiment of the present invention, the MSS<br>
receives the Sleep ID instead of the Basic CID from the BS. Therefore, the<br>
corresponding MSS receiving the Sleep ID, when it receives a traffic indication<br>
message for the listening interval in the sleep mode, analyzes the received Sleep<br>
ID rather than analyzing the Basic CID.<br>
FIG. 10 is a signaling diagram illustrating a process of state transitioning<br>
to a sleep mode by an MSS under the control of a BS. However, before a<br>
description of FIG. 10 is given, it should be noted that the current IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system proposes a scheme of using the Sleep Response message<br>
as a message indicating an unsolicited instruction. The term "unsolicited<br>
instruction" literally means that the MSS operates according to instruction, or<br>
control, of the BS even though there is no separate request from the MSS. For<br>
example, in FIG. 10, the MSS state transitions to the sleep mode according to the<br>
unsolicited instruction.<br><br>
Referring to FIG. 10, a BS 1050 transmits a Sleep Response (SLPRSP)<br>
message to a MSS 1000 in the awake mode, at step 1011, at Step 1013. The Sleep<br>
Response message includes the information elements described with reference to<br>
Table 8, and further includes a Sleep ID (SLPID) uniquely used by the MSS 1000<br>
in the sleep mode according to the second embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The MSS 1000 receiving the Sleep Response message from the BS 1050 analyzes<br>
a Sleep-Approved value included in the Sleep Response message, and state<br>
transitions to the sleep mode if a state transition to the sleep mode is approved at<br>
Step 1015.<br>
In FIG. 10, because the Sleep Response message is used as an unsolicited<br>
instruction message, the Sleep-Approved value is set to only '1'. In addition, as<br>
the MSS 1000 state transitions to the sleep mode, it performs a sleep mode<br>
operation by reading corresponding information elements from the Sleep<br>
Response message.<br>
As described with reference to FIG 9, according to the second<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the MSS receives a Sleep ID rather than.a<br>
Basic CID from the BS. Therefore, the corresponding MSS receiving the Sleep ID,<br>
when it receives a traffic indication message for the listening interval in the sleep<br>
mode, analyzes the received Sleep ID rather than analyzing the Basic CID.<br>
Hereinafter, with reference to FIG. 11, an MSS using the received Sleep<br>
ID under the control of a BS will make a description of an operation of state<br>
transition to the awake mode. FIG 11 is a signaling diagram illustrating a<br>
process of state transitioning to the awake mode by a MSS. under the control of a<br>
BS. Referring to FIG. 11, if a BS 1150 has traffic, or packet data, to be transmitted<br>
to a MSS 1100, it buffers the packet data. Thereafter, if the MSS 1100 arrives at a<br>
listening interval at step 1111, the BS 1150 transmits a traffic indication<br>
(MOB_TRF_IND) message to the MSS 1100 at Step 1113.<br>
The traffic indication message includes the information elements<br>
described with reference to Table 9, and further includes a Sleep ID (SLPID)<br>
uniquely used by the MSS 1100 in the sleep mode according to the second<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The MSS 1100 receiving the traffic indication message from the BS 1150<br><br>
determines if there is Positive_Indication_List in the traffic indication message,<br>
and if there is Positive_Indication_List, the MSS 1100 reads Positive SLPID<br>
included in the traffic indication message and determines whether its own Sleep<br>
ID is included.<br>
It it is determined that its own Sleep ID is included in the traffic indication<br>
message, the MSS 1100 state transitions from the current sleep mode to the<br>
awake mode at Step 1115.<br>
The second embodiment of the present invention has proposed a method of<br>
using a Sleep ID designating an MSS in sleep mode operation instead of a Basic<br>
CID in the traffic indication message, as a method for reducing a size of the<br>
traffic indication message.<br>
The first and second embodiments of the present invention have proposed a<br>
method for efficiently configuring a traffic indication message for directing an<br>
MSS in the sleep mode to state transition to the awake mode, reducing<br>
unnecessary data transmission, and performing effective mode control on the<br>
MSS. That is, the first embodiment has proposed a method of using traffic<br>
indication indexes with a bitmap structure instead of using a series of Basic CIDs<br><br>
designating the MSS. The second embodiment has proposed a method of using a<br>
Sleep ID(SLPID) for identifying a MSS operating in the sleep mode, instead of<br>
using a series of Basic CIDs designating the MSS.<br>
As described above, the first and second embodiments of the present invention<br>
have proposed a method of using a traffic indication index and a Sleep ID<br>
instead of a Basic CID included in the traffic indication message. However, the<br>
present invention is not restricted to the first and second embodiments, and it is<br>
possible to use a combination of the first and second embodiments. For example,<br>
it is possible to perform location allocation using a combination of the first and<br>
second embodiments, i.e., using the Sleep ID in the bitmap structure.<br>
Third Embodiment<br>
A third embodiment of the present invention proposes a system and method for<br>
directing an MSS staying in a listening interval to state transition to the sleep<br>
mode in order to prevent power consumption of the MSS.<br>
Conventionally, if the BS does not include Positive Indication for a<br><br>
corresponding MSS in a traffic indication message among the MSSs staying in<br>
their listening intervals, the MSS continuously maintain the awake mode while<br>
waiting for a traffic indication message until expiration of the listening interval.<br>
However, the BS may not direct the MSS staying in the listening interval to state<br>
transition to the awake mode based on service scheduling for which load<br>
balancing on all MSSs is taken into consideration.<br>
As a result, the MSS unnecessarily wastes its power until the remaining<br>
listening interval. In order to prevent the waste of power, the third embodiment<br>
extends the traffic indication message illustrated in Table 5, and the extended<br>
traffic indication message is illustrated in Table 10.<br><br>
Referring to Table 10, the traffic indication message according to the<br>
third embodiment of the present invention, like the traffic indication message<br>
illustrated in Table 5, uses a series of traffic indication indexes with a bitmap<br>
structure, instead of a series of 16-bit Basic CIDs designating the MSSs. However,<br>
unlike the traffic indication message of Table 5, the traffic indication message of<br>
Table 10 indicates an action that should be taken by the MSS for the listening<br>
interval, and is comprised of a series of traffic indication indexes with two bits<br>
allocated, for one MSS.<br>
In Table 10, Management Message Type is identical to the Management<br>
Message Type described in connection with Table 4, such that a detailed<br>
description thereof will be omitted. Num_of_MSS_Group defined in Table 10<br>
indicates the number of groups, each including several MSSs as described with<br>
reference to Table 5. However, unlike Table 5, Table 10 shows that the number of<br>
MSSs included in one group is defined as, for example, 4.<br>
The NumofMSSGroup is calculated as shown in Equation (3).<br><br><br>
A description of the Num_of_MSS_Group determined according to the<br>
number of MSSs that can be managed by the BS has been given with reference to<br>
Table 5. Unlike the Traffic_Indication_Index in the first embodiment, the<br>
Traffic_Indication_Index in the third embodiment is used to allocate two bits to<br>
each of 4 MSSs, to thereby specify an action that should be taken by<br>
corresponding MSSs awaken from the sleep mode for the listening interval.<br>
In the Traffic_Indication_Index, 2 bits allocated for specifying an action<br>
that should be taken by the MSS for the listening interval are set to the following<br>
values.<br>
-	'00': This value is identical to the value '0' among the values of<br>
respective bits in the Traffic_indication_Index in the method for reducing a size<br>
of a traffic indication message according to the first embodiment, in terms of<br>
meaning and an action taken by the MSS. This value is different from the value<br>
'0' in that because two bits are used, the BS sets the two bits to '00'.<br>
-	'11': This value is identical to the value '1' among the values of<br>
respective bits in the Traffic_indication_Index in the method for reducing a size<br>
of a traffic indication message according to the first embodiment, in terms of<br>
meaning and an action taken by the MSS. Therefore, a detailed description<br>
thereof will be omitted herein.<br>
-	'01': This value indicates that because the BS sends no traffic to a<br>
corresponding MSS awaken for the listening interval, the corresponding MSS no<br>
longer waits for a traffic indication message, and immediately state transitions to<br>
the sleep mode. After state transitioning to the sleep mode, it is preferable for the<br>
MSS to maintain the sleep mode for the remaining listening interval and a newly<br>
updated sleep interval.<br>
-	'10': This value is a reserved value, and can be used for other purposes.<br>
FIG. 12 is a diagram illustrating a format of a traffic indication message<br>
broadcasted from a BS to an MSS according to the third embodiment of the<br><br>
present invention. Referring to FIG. 12, a corresponding traffic indication<br>
message 1200 is comprised of parameters of Management Message Type 1211,<br>
Num_of_MSS_Group 1213, and Traffic_Indication_Indexes 1215 and 1217.<br>
However, before a detailed description of FIG. 12 is given, it will be assumed<br>
herein that the maximum number of MSSs that can be managed by the BS is 7.<br>
Therefore, it is assumed that the MSSs have been allocated the Basic CIDs<br>
described above from 1 to 7. In addition, it is assumed that MSSs having 1, 3, 4, 6,<br>
and 7 as the Basic CIDs are staying in their listening intervals, and thus are<br>
waiting for the traffic indication message transmitted from the BS on a<br>
broadcasting basis.<br>
In FIG 12, the Management Message Type 1211 indicates that the<br>
transmission message is a traffic indication message 1200, and the<br>
Num_of_MSS_Group 1213 is set to '2' in order to allow the BS to accommodate<br>
7 MSSs according to the assumptions stated above. Therefore, two consecutive<br>
Traffic_Indication_Indexes 1215 and 1217 are used, and their respective bits are<br>
allocated to MSSs having 1 to 7 as the Basic CIDs in two bits. On this assumption,<br>
because MSSs 1219, 1223, 1225, 1229, and 1231 having 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7 as Basic<br>
CIDs, respectively, among all MSSs are staying in the listening interval, the<br>
MSSs 1219, 1223, 1225, 1229, and 1231 wait for the traffic indication message<br>
1200. Thereafter, if the traffic indication message is received, the MSSs 1219,<br>
1223, 1225, 1229, and 1231 read corresponding 2-bit values from the<br>
Traffic_Indication_Indexes of the received traffic indication message.<br>
For example, the MSS 1219 having a Basic CID of 1 reads a value of<br>
allocated first two bits from the Traffic_Indication_Index 1215. In this case,<br>
because the corresponding 2-bit value is '01', the BS transmits no traffic for the<br>
listening interval of the MSS 1219 as described above. Therefore, the MSS 1219<br>
immediately state transitions to the sleep mode without waiting for the traffic<br>
indication message for the listening interval, and maintains the sleep mode until<br>
the next listening interval starts.<br>
Unlike this, the MSS 1229 having a Basic CID of 6 reads a 6th 2-bit value<br>
from the Traffic_Indication_Index 1217. In this case, because the corresponding<br>
2-bit value is '11', there is data to be received from the BS for the listening<br>
interval of the MSS 1229. Therefore, the MSS 1229 should state transition to the<br>
awake mode and wait for traffic transmitted from the BS.<br><br>
In addition, the MSS 1231 having a Basic CID of 7 reads a 7th 2-bit value<br>
from the Traffic_Indication_Index 1217. In this case, because the corresponding<br>
2-bit value is '00', there is possible data to be received from the BS for the<br>
listening interval. Therefore, the MSS 1231 should wait for a traffic indication<br>
message until expiration of the listening interval.<br>
In FIG. 12, reference numerals 1221 and 1227 indicate an absence of bits<br>
because the corresponding MSSs are in the awake mode or the sleep mode, as<br>
described with reference to the '00'-bit value in the Traffic_Indication_Index. In<br>
addition, because reference numeral 1233 does not fall within a range of the<br>
number of MSSs that can be managed by the BS, corresponding bits are set to a<br>
meaningless value '00'.<br>
The traffic indication message defined in Table 10 can also have a message format having a variable length as describe in the first embodiment of<br>
the present invention. The traffic indication message is identical in format to the<br>
traffic indication message illustrated in FIG. 7, such that a detailed description<br>
thereof will be omitted herein.<br>
FIG. 13 is a diagram illustrating a process of compulsory state<br>
transitioning to an awake mode by an MSS in response to a request based on a<br>
Traffic_Indication_Index value in a traffic indication message received for a<br>
listening interval in the IEEE 802.16e communication system according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 13, a BS 1300 transmits<br>
traffic indication messages 1311, 1313, 1315, 1317, 1319, 1321, and 1323 to<br>
MSSs 1303, 1305, and 1307 staying in a listening interval.<br>
In FIG. 13, arrows of the traffic indication messages indicate that the<br>
corresponding MSSs have received the corresponding traffic indication messages.<br>
The BS 1300 transmits the traffic indication message to the MSSs 1303, 1305,<br>
and 1307 on a broadcasting basis. In this case, MSSs staying in the sleep mode or<br>
the awake mode do not decode and analyze the traffic indication message.<br>
The traffic indication message includes the information elements<br>
described with reference to Table 10. The MSSs determine the actions they should<br>
take at the next frame, based on corresponding two bits in<br>
Traffic_Indication_Index illustrated in Table 10. FIG. 13 illustrates operations of<br>
corresponding MSSs based on the traffic indication message defined in Table 10.<br><br>
The MSS 1303 receives the traffic indication message 1313 for a<br>
listening interval 1325, extracts two bits corresponding to a Basic CID of the<br>
MSS 1303 from the Traffic_Indication_Index described in connection with Table<br>
10, and analyzes the extracted two bits. Herein, because the 2-bit value<br>
corresponding to the Basic CID is '11', the MSS 1303 state transitions to the<br>
awake mode (1329) regardless of the remaining listening interval.<br>
Next, the MSS 1305 receives the traffic indication message 1311 for a<br>
listening interval 1331, extracts two bits corresponding to a Basic CID of the<br>
MSS 1305 from the Traffic_Indication_Index described in connection with Table<br>
10, and analyzes the extracted two bits. Because the 2-bit value corresponding to<br>
the Basic CID is '00', the MSS 1305 waits for the next traffic indication message<br>
until expiration of the remaining listening interval. Thereafter, because<br>
corresponding two bits in the next traffic indication messages 1313, 1315 and<br>
1317 transmitted by the BS 1300 are also '00', the MSS 1305 waits for the next<br>
traffic indication message until expiration of the listening interval. In this case, as<br>
illustrated in FIG 13, as the listening interval 1331 expires, the MSS 1305<br>
doubles the existing sleep interval, state transitions to the sleep mode, and<br>
maintains the sleep mode for the doubled sleep interval.<br>
After a lapse-of a predetermined time in the sleep mode, the MSS 1305<br>
waits again for a traffic indication message for the next listening interval 1333. In<br>
this case, because a corresponding 2-bit value in the received traffic indication<br>
message is '00', the MSS 1305 waits for the next traffic indication message until<br>
expiration of the remaining listening interval. However, because a corresponding<br>
2-bit value in the received traffic indication message 1321 is '11', the MSS 1305<br>
state transitions to the awake mode at step 1335, regardless of the remaining<br>
listening interval.<br>
Next, the MSS 1307 receives the traffic indication message 1313 for a<br>
listening interval 1337, extracts two bits corresponding to a Basic CID of the<br>
MSS 1307 from the Traffic_Indication_Index described in connection with Table<br>
10, and analyzes the extracted two bits. Herein, because the extracted 2-bit value<br>
is '01', the MSS 1307 state transitions to the sleep mode regardless of the<br>
remaining listening interval 1337, thereby minimizing power consumption.<br>
After the compulsory state transition to the sleep mode at step 1339, the<br><br>
MSS 1307 maintains the sleep mode for a time determined by adding up the<br>
remaining listening interval and a doubled sleep interval. Next, the MSS 1307<br>
receives and decodes the traffic indication message 1323 for a new listening<br>
interval 1341.<br>
In the foregoing description, operations of the thee MSSs 1303, 1305, and<br>
1307 cover all possible cases and operations occurring in the traffic indication<br>
message described in conjunction with Table 10. That is, with reference to FIG.<br>
13, a description has been made of an operation in which a MSS state transitions<br>
to the awake mode according to an operating condition requested by a BS, waits<br>
for a traffic indication message, or makes a compulsory state transition to the<br>
sleep mode, for a listening interval.<br>
FIG 14 is a flowchart illustrating a process of compulsory state<br>
transitioning by an MSS in response to a request from a BS for a listening interval<br>
according to the third embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 14,<br>
an MSS staying in the sleep mode at step 1411 proceeds to step 1413. In step<br>
1413, the MSS determines whether a sleep interval has expired, i.e., whether it<br>
should further stay in the sleep mode. If it is determined that the sleep interval has<br>
expired, the MSS proceeds to step 1415. However, if it is determined that the<br>
sleep interval has not expired, the MSS returns to step 1413.<br>
In step 1415, the MSS determines whether a listening interval has expired.<br>
If it is determined that the listening interval has expired, the MSS proceeds to step<br>
1429, where it state transitions to the sleep mode. However, if it is determined in<br>
step 1415 that the listening interval has not expired, the MSS proceeds to step<br>
1417.<br>
In step 1417, the MSS determines whether a traffic indication message is<br>
received from the BS. If it is determined that a traffic indication message is<br>
received from the BS, the MSS proceeds to step 1419. However, if it is<br>
determined in step 1417 that no traffic indication message is received from the BS,<br>
the MSS returns to step 1415.<br>
In step 1419, the MSS determines whether there are two bits in<br>
Traffic_Indication_Index described in connection with Table 10, being mapped to<br>
a Basic CID of the corresponding MSS, based on Num_of_MSS_Group included<br>
in the received traffic indication message. This means that the traffic indication<br><br>
message can have a variable traffic indication index. If it is determined that there<br>
are corresponding two bits, the MSS proceeds to step 1421. However, if it is<br>
determined in step 1419 that the corresponding two bits do not exist in the<br>
Traffic_Indication_Index, the MSS returns to step 1415, determining that no<br>
traffic indication message is received.<br>
In step 1421, the MSS analyzes corresponding two bits indicating an<br>
action requested for the listening interval by the BS. If it is determined that the<br>
corresponding two bits are '01', the MSS proceeds to step 1429 where it state<br>
transitions to the sleep mode regardless of the remaining listening interval,<br>
thereby minimizing power consumption. However, if it is determined in step 1421<br>
that the corresponding two bits are not '01', the MSS proceeds to step 1425.<br>
In step 1425, the MSS determines whether the corresponding two bits are<br>
'11'. If it is determined that the corresponding two bits are '11', the MSS<br>
proceeds to step 1431 where it state transitions to the awake mode, considering<br>
that there is traffic to be received from the BS. However, if it is determined that<br>
the corresponding two bits are not '11', the MSS proceeds to step 1427.<br>
In step 1427, the MSS determines whether the corresponding two bits are<br>
'00'. If it is determined that the corresponding two bits are '00', the MSS returns<br>
to step 1415 to receive again a traffic indication message described in connection<br>
with Table 10, because the BS may have traffic to be transmitted to the<br>
corresponding MSS. Also, if it is determined that the corresponding two bits are<br>
not '00', the MSS proceeds to step 1415 to receive again a traffic indication<br>
message, because it means that the corresponding two bits are '10' indicating a<br>
value reserved for other purposes.<br>
As described above, the present invention is advantageous in that it<br>
supports sleep mode and awake mode operations in a Broadband Wireless Access<br>
communication system using an OFDM/OFMDA, i.e., an IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system. More specifically, some of the advantages of the sleep<br>
mode and awake mode operations according to the present invention are as<br>
follows:<br>
(1) In the IEEE 802.16e communication system, if a BS has traffic to be<br>
transmitted to a MSS staying in the sleep mode, the BS includes a series of 16-bit<br>
Basic CIDs designating the corresponding MSS in a traffic indication message as<br><br>
described above.<br>
However, because a range of Basic CIDs designating MSSs in one BS<br>
occupies a very small part of Basic CID#1 to Basic CID#m among a total of<br>
65536 Basic CIDs, 16-bit Basic CIDs include unnecessary most significant bits<br>
(MSBs). Therefore, an increase in number of MSSs that can be managed by the<br>
BS causes a waste of a bandwidth needed by the BS to transmit a traffic<br>
indication message. In addition, the BS directs a corresponding MSS to state<br>
transition to the awake mode using one or more traffic indication messages.<br>
However, the present invention significantly reduces a length of a traffic<br>
indication message by using traffic indication indexes with a bitmap structure,<br>
instead of a series of Basic CIDs for the traffic indication message. Accordingly,<br>
it is possible to direct a MSS to state transition to the awake mode by transmitting<br>
only one traffic indication message.<br>
(2) In the IEEE 802.16e communication system, an MSS in the sleep<br>
mode awakes for the listening interval and repeats a process of determining<br>
whether there is a Basic CID designation the MSS while waiting for a traffic<br>
indication message transmitted by the BS. That is, if the MSS fails to receive a<br>
traffic indication message for the listening interval or there is no Basic CID in the<br>
traffic indication message even though the traffic indication message is received,<br>
the MSS continues to perform the above process.<br>
Therefore, the BS is_not required to direct the MSS staying in the<br>
listening interval tostate transition to the awake mode based on service scheduling<br>
for which load balancing on all MSSs is taken into consideration. However, an<br>
MSS, which is not informed about the situation, waits for a traffic indication<br>
message, continuously and unnecessarily wasting its power until expiration of the<br>
listening interval.<br>
However, the present invention uses traffic indication indexes with a<br>
bitmap structure used by the BS to identify an action that should be taken by the<br>
MSS instead of using the Basic CIDs in the traffic indication message transmitted<br>
for the listening interval. Accordingly, the BS directs the MSSs to state transition<br>
to the sleep mode, thereby minimizing unnecessary power consumption.<br>
As can be understood from the foregoing description, the present<br><br>
invention remarkably reduces a length of a traffic indication message using traffic<br>
indication indexes with a bitmap structure, instead of Basic CIDs, when<br>
transmitting the traffic indication message in the BWA communication system.<br>
Accordingly, it is possible to direct an MSS to state transition to the awake mode<br>
by transmitting only one traffic indication message.<br>
While the present invention has been shown and described with reference<br>
to certain preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in<br>
the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the<br>
