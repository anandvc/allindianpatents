				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a medical care equipment for neonates. More particularly, but not exclusively, the invention relates to an equipment for neonatal care for providing intermediary care in lower level health centers such as rural, public health centers, taluk hospitals, etc.<br>
Warmers, incubators etc. are normally used in neonatal intensive care unit under controlled external ambient. Warmers are open care systems based on remote infrared radiant warming. Direct radiant warming leads to high water losses and high resting metabolic rates for the baby. Prolonged exposure to bright light emitted by these warmers are also known to cause damage to the cone photoreceptors in the infant"s eyes. Also, detachment of the skin temperature probe or failure of control mechanisms may cause serious over-heating and hyperthermia in the infant. In lower end health facilities where sterile surroundings cannot be ensured, the units can expose the infant to cross infections. Some of the known incubators use a hinging or sliding mechanisms for opening. As a result, whenever the front plate is opened, the interior gets exposed to the surrounding atmosphere and gets cooled and considerable time is necessary for warming. Incubators are closed care systems based on forced air convection. Skilled personnel are required for operating, monitoring and maintaining these units. Moreover they require continuous supply of oxygen whose flow rate, pressure, humidity, etc., need to be precisely controlled through servo control mechanisms. Uninterrupted, ripple free and stabilized power source is often recommended   for   their   operation.   Also,   due   to   their   non-insulating<br><br>
characteristics, radiation and convection losses are higher and it is very difficult to maintain warmth in intermittent power supply conditions. Absence of any of the above can lead to serious system malfunction that can scorch or over-heat the infant Incubators can be a potmt source of infection due to the presence of a water tank for humidifying the baby chamber. Poor accesability for cleaning and sterilizatioo of the baby chamber adds to the problem, especially, where the number of side and premature infants is high with hardly any lead time for sterilization and â– Mmteoance. DM to the above limitatioas and high coat, incubators and warmers are genenlly not suitable for use in smaller health facilities, especially in a rural environment where majority of the neonatal deadis take place due to non-availability of basic medical assistance.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to develop a natural convection based intermediary care unit for warming, observation, stabilization and transport of premature, ill or new bom babies at lower level health centres. With this objective in view, the present invention provides a medical care equipment with a boost heating mechanism that surses and provides supplementary and controlled heating to reduce warm up time and ensure absloute safety, overcoming the main drawback of the requirement of huge warm up time for natural convection wanning.<br>
The equipment according to the invention is provided with good insulation to prevent fast cooling of the interior. Accordingly, the present invention provides an equipment with the front and part of the top of the unit, which can be opened and closed without exposing the baby to direct draft, by a uniquly shaped cover which moves along a curved path and<br><br>
which is held in postion fay a catch, rather than a sliding or hinging mechanism common in most of the closed care systems. This avoids obstruction to the attending personnel and minimizes heat loss, whenever unit is partially or fully opened.<br>
The equipment according to the invention is simple and is of modular in design, rugged in construction, economical to manufacture and adaptable to various configurations, depending on the requirements of a specific health center. It has removable and replaceable baby tray that facilitates cleaning and quick sterilization, without affecting the distribution of air flow and heat spread, unlike conventional system where cleaning and sterilizing is cumberaome. It has a built-in flexibility to adapt to various configurations, depending on the requirements of a specific health center. The unit can be used either as a table top product or can be wheeled near mother for closer bond with the baby.<br>
The equipment according to the invention is provided with a specially designed ventilation system ensuring adequate fresh air flow and compact design for the unit as per medical requirement Thus, external, uninterrupted and controlled oxygen supply is not a must for opnation. The unit is designed to work in lower level health centers especially the rural environment where power fluctuations are common.<br>
The equipment according to the present invention, has a provision fee accommodating fluid cartridges as heat store within the unit to maintain warmth for a kmg duration even in the absence of power. Thus it can also be used as   a passive wanner, during transportation of sick: neonates to<br><br>
specialised hospitals. This will be useful as a supplementary heat source for critical infants during very cold ambient temperatures.<br>
Thus the invention provides a medical care equipment for neonates comprising : a chamber having an outer wall and an inner wall thennally insulated at the bottom with a thermal insulating material, a cover having a movable port pivoted on the outer wall with a pivot assaembly for opening the movable part of the cover, a heat spreader assembly mounted at the base of the said outer wall; a heater unit located below said heat spreader assembly and controlled by a control pannel provided with temperature controller. and a baby tray supported by an insulating platform located on the said heat spreader assembly.<br>
The invention will be described with reference to the prefered embodiment shown in the accompanying drawings;<br>
Figure 1 shows an isometric view of the medical care equipment for neonates according to the invention.<br>
Figure 2 shows the top view of the medical care equipment shown in figure 1.<br>
Figure 3 shows th sectional view along A-A shown in figure 2.<br>
Figure 4 shows the sectional view along B-B showin in figure 2.<br><br>
The medical care equipment according to the invention consists of a chamber with double wall insulation to cut off thermal losses from the sides. The dumber consists of an outer wall (16) and an inner- wall (4).<br>
The outer wall (16) of the chamber is thermally insulated at the bottom with the help of a thermally insulating material (5) to minimize heat tosses due to the tadiation from its bottom wall. A baby tray (11) is located at a pre-determined height and supported by an insulating platform (10) inside the chamber. The insulating platform (10) shields baby tray (11) from direct radiation from the heat spreader assembly (12) keeping the surface temperature of the baby tray within safety levels. A convection channel (21) is provided between the heat apreader- assembly (12) and insulating platform (11). This ensures good air circulation and heat distribution. The outerwall (16) consists of buih in support stand (22) for positioning and fixing the heat spreader assembly (12) and the insulating platform (10). The baby tray(11) can be removed for sterilization, maintenance and transport The baby trey may be preferably covered by a translucent insulating material, which can be fastened over baby trey. It serves as a double wall to reduce radiant loss from the infent inside the unit and conserves heat as well as protects the infant when baby tray is transported  independendy.<br>
The heat spreader assembly (12) is mounted at the base of the outer wall (16) resting on the support stand (22). The beater unit (23) is positioned below it, thus isolating the heater unit (23) from the baby tray (11) physically and electrically.<br><br>
A two part top cover consisting of the fixed pert (17)and the movable part (15) is provided to the chamber on a pivot assembly (3) and a roller mechanism (9). The equipment can be opened preferably upto two-thirds using the movable part (15) of the top cover. The movable part (15) can be moved in a semi circular sliding motion and is held fay a catch (24) in the closed as well as in the open position. Gravity assists this in both positions during necessary manipulations and holds the movable part (15) of the cover in any desired open position. For minor manipulations at least one window (13) is provided on the cover, through which a person treating can reach the baby. In this case, most of the flow path of the air convection in the interior is preserved and the cooling of the interior air is kept to a minimum. Moreover, the movable part (15) of the cover is provided with a transparent dome (14) to facilitate observation and periodic checks without the requirement of openmg the unit. The movable part (15) of the cover is pivoted to the outer wall of the chamber and is guided by rollers (9) mounted on the fixed part (17) of the cover, which eliminates the need for hinges. The catch (24) may be in the form of a counter balance, a spring dement, a magnet, roller ball or a friction brake.<br>
When the equipment is closed and a premature or newborn baby is inside, sufficient amount of fresh air should be dmwn into the interior, to flush out the exhaled carbon-di-oxide. This is achieved by providing inlet vents (25) at the side wall of the chamber which are optimized in size, shape and position to ensure fresh air circulation. The exhaled carbon-diÂ¬oxide is flushed out through outlet vents (8) provided on the movable part (15) of the top cover. The heater unit (23) consists of a boost heater that is provided additionally to shorten initial temperature rise time. It is controlled<br><br>
by a thermostat (28). Boost heater is kept active only during the initial start up and whenever a sudden drop in internal temperature is experienced during opening of unit for accessing the infant. A low wattage heat source is also part of the heater unit (23) and is in regular operation to compensate for steady heat losses and maintain internal temperature. This makes the unit safe, reliable, energy efficient and helps build redundancy into the heat source. This heat is uniformly distributed by a heat spreader assembly (12) for even heat spread and quick rise time. The heat spreader assembly (12) also protects the heater unit (23) from damage and isolates the heater unit (23). External fresh air is attracted towards the heated surface through inlet vents (25) on the wall of the chamber and having optimum size, shape and position over the heat spreader assembly (12). The inlet air mix in the convection channel (21) is directed upwards through convection channel (21) in the gap between the inner wall (4) and baby tray (11). The warm air rises, spreads in the chamber and partially leaves through the outlet vents (8). A weak convection channel is formed in the gap between the heat spreader assembly (12) and the bottom of the chamber, which facilitates air flow at the base of the heater surface preventing localized hot spots within the heater unit (23). Additional heat, which may be required under exceptional circumstances such as, very cold ambient, top cover frilly opened or in the case of transporting very critical babies, may be provided by accommodating fluid cartridges (26) between the inner wall of the chamber and the baby tray (11) before transporting them to higher levels hospitals.<br>
The electrical circuits are isolated from the chamber, they are enclosed in  the   space between the two walls of the chamber,   behind  the control<br><br>
panel (1). When the unit is in operation, temperature rises steadily above the external ambient temperature. The unit has a three level safety mechanism and is designed for total safely. A thermostat (28) is provided on the beat spreader assembly (12) as the first level safety mechanism, which cuts off the boost heater as the internal temperature reaches a preset temperature preferably 31 Â°C, Another temperature controller is provided in the control panel (1) as the second level safety mechanism which cuts off both the boost heater and the main heater when the internal temperature of the chamber reaches a pre-set value. It receives feedback from an air temperature sensor (27) positioned in the chamber to sense the internal ambient temperature. The user can pre-set the cutoff temperature in the range preferaUy 30 to 38Â°C.<br>
A hardware setting lock (18) is provided for the equipment which prevents accidental alteration in the cutoff settings of the temperature. A software setting lock is also provided which prevents unautherised person to after the setting while tbe hardware lock is open. In the event that both the safety mechanisms fail, which is highly unlikely, a limit thermostat (29) is provided as a tfaiid level safety feature. The limit thermostat (29) acts when the chamber internal ambient temperature exceeds 38oC. This activates a resetting mechanical tripper that breake the circuit and cuts off electric supply and simuhaneously activates an audio visual alarm (7). A fast acting fuse prefects the equipment against current surges. Even in the remotest chance of all the controls failing simultaneously, the selection of heat sources ensures that mternal temperature will never rise beyond dangerous levels that may cause irreversible damage to tbe infant.<br><br>
The control panel assembly (1) consists of a push button power switch (20) with a built in green lamp indication, which glows during power "ON". A red lamp alarm indication glows and buzzer comes on in the event of internal ambient temperature exceeding 38oC. Temperature upper limit for internal ambient is pre-set through push buttons on a controller (19). Pre-set and current internal temperature is displayed in the temperature readout (19) by toggling the push buttons on controller (19). A separate probe can sense the baby"s abdominal skin temperature and the temperature can be indicated on a digital display.<br>
Preferably a handgrip (6) may be provided on the movable cover. It is desirable to provide a set of covered openings (2) may be provided for inserting tube for Intra venous (I.V.), oxygen, drainage, suction etc. into the chamber, through the outer wall so that the introduction of these tubes do not require opening and closing of the cover. A pedestal lamp may be provided which is focused on the transparent window for a green house effect to supplement warmth when required. Intra venous (l.V.) is used for drug, nutrient solution or other substance injected directly into vein.<br>
The medical care equipment for neonates according to the invention uses a low powered heat source, which makes the product safe. Even if the control mechanism fails the maximum temperature will be within the safe limits for the newborn. At the same time the boost heating provision which comes on only when the external ambient becomes low and hence compensates the heat loss by temporary use of higher power. On reaching the desired temperature this boost heater gets cuts off The equipment configuration allows the baby tray to be taken out and cleaned thoroughly avoiding cross infection between newborn babies after one newborn is<br><br>
removed and the next one is put in. It has the provision for inserting fluid cartridge, during electrical power failure for extending the warmth for longer duration. The equipment does not have any serviceable part and therefore needs minimum maintenance at the installed location. The equipment was designed keeping in mind the social requirements of the rural areas. The new bom baby should not be touched by visitors to avoid transfer of infections to the newborn baby and this is made possible by providing a visual acrylic barrier, which does dual functions of physical isolation from the visitors and gives a psychological feeling that the baby"s condition is delicate. The acrylic barrier also helps in retaining the warmth inside the chamber. The shape augments natural convection, does not need forced air convection and thereby saves electrical power. The positioning of the baby tray ensures that the newborn does not get air draft and gets a saturated and stabilised air temperature compared to other similar systems in which the child gets the undesirable natural or forced air drafi in the room. Provision of setting lock in the controller and additional hardware setting lock doubly ensures that an error or accident never changes the preset temperature settings. The baby tray can be Wrapped with a covering sheet and the baby can be transponted along with the tray, which will retain warmth for some duration and therefore can be used for intra hospital transportation. The equipment can also be transported on wheels within the hospital.<br><br><br>
