				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>The aim is to provide an AN IMPROVISED DRY &amp; WET GRINDER., involving an unique concept in the grinding technique. It basically has three segments, the Drum Assembly, Stationary Shaft Assembly and the Base Frame. The Drum Assembly carries a Circular Base Stone and a Worm Gear. The Stationary Shaft Assembly consists of a shaft, Upper Feed Arm, lower Feed Arm and a Base Stone. The Base Stone and the Circular Base Stone butt against each other, forming the grinding zone and the food material is guided through the upper feed arm to the grinding area, whereas the lower Feed Arm helps In the recycling process. Fineness and coarseness of the material to be ground is achieved by operating a pressure tam and lever assembly, mounted on top of the stationary shaft. Clockwise turn of the pressure came lever increases the pressure in the grind ing area and vice-versa.</td>

				<td>This invention relates to an "IMPROVISED DRY &amp; WET GRINDER"<br>
The field of Grinding Machines for domestic purpose has been evolving new techniques every day and it has been found that several models have been arrived at, which have been improvements over the earlier versions. This invention IMPROVISED DRY &amp; WET GRINDER" is one such machine, which is a vast improvement over the conventional models. Assembling of the various parts is much simpler and precise, as in this invention each and every locking system is guided by a washer or a similar device, which ensures that the play at the joints is to a minimum extent and therefore suitably guided. Further, the efficiency of this "IMPROVISED DRY &amp; WET GRINDER" is much better than the conventional models, as the grinder is very compact with the span between the axis of the Drum and the motor, being considerably reduced, resulting in a more positive and efficient drive.<br>
This invention "IMPROVISED DRY &amp; WET GRINDER" is a new invention involving an unique concept in grinding.<br>
This "IMPROVISED DRY &amp; WET GRINDER" basically consists of the following:<br>
1)	DRUM ASSEMBLY<br>
2)	STATIONARY SHAFT ASSEMBLY<br>
3)	THE BASE FRAME<br>
The Drum Assembly consists of the following;<br>
a)	Steel Drum (17)<br>
b)	Circular Base Stone (15)<br>
c)	Worm Gear (18)<br><br>
The Stationary Shaft Assembly consists of the following:<br>
a)	Shaft (23)<br>
b)	Upper Feed Arm (22)<br>
c)	Lower Feed Arm (21)<br>
d)	Base Stone (19)<br>
The Base Frame (1) carries the Drive Mechanism i.e., the motor, the pulleys and the belt.<br>
The Steel Drum (17) made of 316 Grade Steel, houses the Circular Base Stone (15). The Circular Base Stone (15) has a concentric groove between it circumference and ^is. It is also serrated at the grinding area. The Worm Gear (18) is fixed at the center of the grooved Circular Base Stone (15). The Ring Nut (14) and the Adapter (16) ensure that the Circular Base Stone (15) is in place.<br>
The Upper Feed Arm (22) and the Lower Feed Arm (21) are located on the Stationary Shaft Assembly. The Base Stone (19) is fixed at the bottom end of the Stationary Shaft Assembly and has serrations on its bottom surface that comes into contact with the grooved Circular Base Stone (15). The Lower end of the Stationary Shaft Assembly has an inverted-cup shaped formation (20), with an opening for entry of material to the Worm Gear (18). This particular shape ensures that the flow of material is unidirectional. To be precise, material, which is fed to the Worm, goes down to the grinding area only and does not spill back into the drum.<br><br>
On the top of the shaft assembly are provided two Pressure Cams (26 &amp; 28) controlled by a lever (30), by the use of which, grinding pressure can be regulated. The cam assembly is accommodated between the Lower Lid (25) and the Upper Lid (31) and the upper lid being seated on a "C" channel (27). Clockwise turn of the Pressure Cam Lever (30) increases the pressure and the anti-clockwise turn of the Pressure Cam Lever decreases the pressure in the grinding area Accordingly, the desired fineness and coarseness of the material being ground can be achieved by turning the cam-lever mechanism.<br>
The Base Frame (1) carries the drive mechanism on the Base Mounting Plate (2), which constitutes of the Motor (10), the Motor Fan (11) and the Capacitor (12). Motor Pulley (7) is fixed to the Motor Shaft, which drives the Pulley (6) oil the Drive Shaft (9), mounted on a Ball Bearing Assembly [constituting of the Ball Bearing (3), Bearing Spacer (4) and the Bearing Cap (5)1 through the beh drive (8) and the whole thing is covered by a moulded Shell (13).<br>
The Drum Assembly and the Stationary Shaft Assembly are fixed in place on the Appliance. The construction is such that the Stationary Shaft Assembly exerts pressure on the Circular Base Stone (15) at the point of contact, otherwise known as the grinding area. This pressure is brought about by the action of a stainless steel Spring (24) provided around the shaft at the top. Over this spring are placed the Pressure Cams (26 &amp; 28) and Pressure Cam Lever (30) by means of which the pressure can be increased or decreased. The food material to be ground is put into the Drum Assembly and the appliance is switched on. The Drum Assembly begins to rotate and the grinding process is initiated.<br><br>
The Upper Feed Arm (22) gathers the material to be ground and feeds it to the Spiral Worm (18). This feeding is repeated with every turn of the drum assembly. The worm pushes down the material by its spiral action to the grinding area where the grinding takes place. Partially ground material comes out of the grinding area and collects in the groove on the rotating Circular Base Stone (15). The Lower Feed Arm (21) is fixed on the Stationary shaft asembly such that it lifts up the ground material from the groove of the rotating Circular Base Stone (15) and feeds it again to the Worm (18). The downward spiral movement of the rotating Worm pushes the material to the grinding zone or the grinding area. This feeding by lifting action is such that the partially ground material is recycled to the spiral Worm from where it is pushed down to the grinding area over and over again, repeatedly and contmuously till all the material is ground to the desired fineness or coarseness. The desired grinding fmeness or coarseness is achieved by the control of the pressure Cam by means of the pressure Cam Lever, as explained earlier above<br><br><br>
