FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an improved flexible dosing system for injecting<br>
"Lubncity additive" adaptable to Gas Turbines operating on Naphtha fuel. The<br>
improved system can adapt several quality of "Lubricity additives" available in<br>
the rnerket<br>
Gas Turbines are required to operate on various types of fuels.<br>
Whet ever,Naptha fuel is readily available and offer significant advantages in<br>
availability and cost, becomes attractive for use as fuel in Gas Turbine systems.<br>
While. Naphtha fuel may offer significant advantages, this fuel has the<br>
characteristic of low lubricity. Accordingly, this particular characteristic of<br>
Naphtha fuel does warrant additional treatment to assure long life of the Gas<br>
Turbine, particularly of the fuel system components of the turbine<br>
The operating life of a typical fuel system of the Gas Turbine depends on the<br>
lubricating capability of the hydrocarbon fuels used in the Gas Turbine to protect<br>
bearing and its mating surfaces.<br>
To distribute the liquid fuel flow equally to the combustion chambers, prior art<br>
Gas Turbines use mechanical flow dividers that have very tight tolerance of<br>
internal mating parts to meter the fuel flow to the multiple combustion<br><br><br>
chambers, ihese flow dividei* have been very successful n# providing a very<br>
tight tolerance of flow division needed to provide uniform distribution of<br>
temperatures from the combustion system and into the turbine section. As on<br>
today, flow dividers are an essential feature of liquid fuel-fired gas turbines.<br>
For the Gas Turbines operating on Naphtha fuel, a "Lubricity additive* is<br>
generally to be dosed or injected into the Naphtha fuel for raising the lubricity<br>
parameters to such ievels which are acceptable to the flow dividers.<br>
The following operational constraints also need attention with respect to<br>
selection of the dosing rate of the "Lubricity additive" into Naphtha fuel:-<br>
(i) If the injection rate is too high, gumming of the flow divider will<br>
occur and the flow divider will stop gripping the turbine,<br>
(ii) If the injection rate is too low, the bearings of the flow divider will<br>
seize, also tripping the turbine,<br>
(iii) Lubricity properties of Naphtha formulations vary depending on the<br>
particular production process adopted by different manufacturers,<br>
(iv) the cost of "Lubricity additive* is considerably high in Gas Turbine<br>
based plant, and any reduction in additive injection rate if achieved,<br>
will lead to significant savings in operational cost of the plant.<br>
Traditionally, Hitec-580 is used as the "Lubricity additive*. Tests have shown that<br>
riitec-580 additive injection to produce a concentration of 60-75 ppm [weight by<br>
weight] of Naphtha fuel flow rate into the Gas Turbine is the best overall rate.<br>
Presently, the following Â»s recommended by the Gas Turbine manufacturers for<br>
the injection of "Hitec-580 additive" for opeiation of Gas Turbines operating on<br>
Naphtha fuel.<br><br><br>
(i) I he initial flow rate of "Hitec-M&gt;0 additive* is selected to provide a<br>
concentration of 75 ppm [weight by weight] of Naphtha fuel flow<br>
rate into new Gas Turbines, operating on Naphtha<br>
fii) The flow divider shall be removed, disassembled and inspected at<br>
frequent intervals for measuring the rate of deposition. If the initial<br>
concentration of the additive results in excessive deposits, the<br>
injection rate shall be reduced to 60 ppm [weight by weight]. The<br>
evaluation process shall be continued and if the excessive deposits<br>
continue to form, the injection rate shall further be reduced while<br>
ensuring that there is no undue "wear" taking place m the bearings<br>
of the flow divider.<br>
(iii) Under no circumstances the dosing rate shall be lower than 30 ppm<br>
^weight by weight], below which the resultant wear will lead to<br>
very short life of the flow divider,<br>
(iv) The cost of additive can be minimized by consistent inspection,<br>
evaluation and tuning of the additive dosing rate to a minimum<br>
extent required<br>
In addition to Hitec 580, various other "lubricity additives" under different brand<br>
names, are available for Gas Turbines operating on Naphtha fuel. Gas Turbine<br>
users are aiso preferring the available choice in selection of "lubricity additive" to<br>
procure the same at competitive prices thus leading to reduction in plant<br>
operating costs.<br><br>
Accordingly, various available additives have also been tested by the Gas Turbine<br>
manufacturers, However, in line with the test results, the recommended<br>
maximum and minimum dosage rate of various types of additives differ from<br>
brand to brand, compared to the standard recommended dosaqe rate of 30-75<br>
ppm for Hitee-580.<br>
The details of various "lubricity additives" along with their recommended<br>
minimum to maximum dosage rate is as per the following table.<br><br><br><br>
From the above table, it can be construed that the 'Lubricity auditive* dosing<br>
system - for operation of Gas Turbines on Naphtha fuel generally needs further<br>
special treatment as below:<br>
(i) The dosage flow rate of "Lubricity additive" shall be in accordance<br>
with Naphtha fuel flow rate into the Gas Turbine on weight to<br>
weight basis. In correspondence with the variations of load on the<br>
(ias Turbine, the Naphtha flow rate into the Gas Turbine also<br>
varies. The Gas Turbine generally responds instantaneously to any<br>
variation of bad which is not: predictable. Hence, the "Lubricity<br>
additive' dosing system need to be designed in such a way that the<br>
flow rate of "Lubricity additive" should be instantaneously changed<br>
in registration with the variations in flow rate of Naphtha fuel into<br>
the Gas Turbine.<br>
For typical Gas Turbines, the Naphtha flow rate depends on its density and<br>
Calorific value. The density of Naphtha varies from 0.65 to 0.75 Kg/Lit. The<br>
calorific value of Naphtha fuel is close to 10,000 Kcal/Kg. The turn down<br>
requirement of Naphtha flow rate into the Gas Turbine is 41 on volume basis,<br>
couesponding to the maximum and minimum flow rates of Naphtha into the Gas<br>
Turbine.<br>
(ii) In addition, the dosage rate of "Lubricity additive" in terms of ppm<br>
is variable for a plant depending on an outcome of the balance of<br>
wear and plugging with respect to the individual Naphtha<br>
formulation used in the plant. Accordingly, the dosage rate of<br>
"Lubn<: additive varies from ppm to depending on></:>
the biand of "lubricity additive "selected.<br><br><br>
The dosage rate of "lubricity additive" in terms of ppm is an<br>
outcome of inspection of the dismantled flow divider and will be<br>
maintained constant till the next inspection<br>
However, the lubricity dosing system shall be capable of meeting<br>
the probable variation in dosing rate in terms of ppm,in addition to<br>
the variation in Naphtha flow due to changes in loads on Gas<br>
Turbine.<br>
For a typical Gas Turbine, corresponding to maximum and<br>
minimum dosing rate variation of 100 ppm to 25 ppm, the turn<br>
down requirement of "Lubricity additive" dosing is 4:1 on volume<br>
basis<br>
Further, the lubricity additive dosing rate is on weight to weight<br>
basis with respect to Naphtha flow into Gas Turbine. The weight of<br>
"lubricity additive" depends on the density of brand of additive<br>
used. Accoidingiy, the turn down requirement of "Lubricity<br>
additive" for a density variation of the additive of 0.8748 to 0.94 is<br>
1.1:1, on volume basis,<br>
Accordingly, for a typical Gas Turbine, the combined turn down<br>
requirement of "Lubricity additive" is 17.6:1, meeting variations in<br>
Gas Turbine load including variations in ppm level of dosing, and<br>
variations in densities of lubricity additives.<br><br><br>
Hence, the lubricity additive dosing system should be capable of<br>
matching the wide variations in the "Lubricity additive" flow rate<br>
required.<br>
(iii) As the dosing quantity is very smali and trie same is sensitive in<br>
terms of choking/wear of the flow divider, the dosing rate shall be<br>
accurate Hence, there should he a feed back system to ensure that<br>
the "Lubricity additive' dosage is as per the requirement only.<br>
Further, the components of the system shall be accurate enough to<br>
ensure accurate dosing,<br>
Iiv) The viscosity oj "Liirbicity additive" is varying from as low as 20 Cst<br>
to 256 Cst. depending on the brand of "Lurbicity Additive"<br>
chosen.Normally, there will not be any operational problem for<br>
dosing pumps for a lubricity level of 20 Cst. However, the dosing<br>
pumps shall be capable of operating at high viscosity level of 256<br>
Cst<br>
(v) As the "Lubricity additive" is available in the standard barrels, there<br>
shall be suitable provision for unloading the same into the system.<br>
The "Lurbicity Additive" dosing systems- for the typical Gas Turbines operating<br>
on Naphtha fuel in practice are normally designed tor one particular "Lubricity<br>
Additive" ie.t Hitec-580 and for a particular dosing rate. These systems constitute<br>
gear type "Lubricity additive* dosing pumps with automatic speed control of the<br>
pumps with variable frequency drive.<br>
The above system has a limited turn down of 7:1 only. Hence, this system can<br>
not cater to 
dosage rates, densities, where a minimum turn down of 17 6:1 is required.<br><br><br>
Further gear pumps have a ttindeiity fui lower throughput <a> the ViitOiiity Ci<br>
fluid is higher, thus calling for higher capacity of the pump when handling higher<br>
viscosity Lubuciry additive", which further calls for much higher turndown<br>
requirement.<br>
In these systems manual unloading of "Lubricity additive" into the system<br>
storage tank is practiced,, which is labor intensive,<br>

It is therefore an object of the invention to propose an improved dosing system<br>
for injecting lubricity additive adaptable to gas turbines operating on naphtha<br>
fuel.<br>
Another object of the invention to propose an improved dosing system for<br>

which eliminates the disadvantages of the prior art<br>

injecting lubricating a&amp;Mi^ adaptable to gas turbines operating on naphtha fuel<br>
which is capable to cater for the variations in viscocities of different types of<br>
available lubricity additives.<br>
A still further object object of the invention to propose an improved dosing<br>
system for injecting lubricity additive adaptable to gas turbines operating on<br>
naphtha fuel which provides mechanized unloading of lubricity additives to the<br>
storage tank of the system.<br><br><br>

which is faster, economic and accurate<br>

3.2.0. Components Description.<br>
As the dosing requires accurate metering, positive displacement plunger pumps<br>
are ideal choice. Fuither, with plunger pumps it is possible to have a higher turn<br>
down in flow rate by combined effect of stroke length variation along with<br>
variable speed operation of the pump.<br><br>
Accordingly,, atieast two motor driven plunger type reciprocating pumps (1<br>
working f 1 standby) of suitable capacity and head are considered for the<br>
system.<br>
Blither, check valves ^witti double ball witliout spring) ate envisaged as a special<br>
design in these pumps (6), to cater to higher viscosity requirement of 256 Cst.<br>
These check valves are suitable for operation on low viscosity of 20 Cst also.<br>
The pump (t&gt;) has manual stroke iength setting provision with a turn down ration<br>
of 10:1. ie., the stroke length can be varied from 10% to 100%. The flow rate of<br>
the. pump is proportional to the stroke length set.<br>
Further, for a given stroke iength setting, the flow rate can be varied by<br>
changing the speed of operation of the pump (S).<br>

dampener (?) is provided on the discharge line of the pumps (6), so that<br>
smoother flow is ensured in the downstream system Further, the flow meter(8)<br>
provided in the system also requires a non-pulsating Row for effective operation.<br><br>
5.0.0 Flow Meter: (8)<br>

device (9).<br>
6.0.0. Interconnecting Piping and Instrumentation:<br>
6.1.0. Function:<br>
All the required inter connecting piping and instrumentation like safety valves,<br>
gauges and transmitters are provided as shown in Rgute-2 for monitoring and<br>
safe operation of the system.<br>
7.0,0. Control device with Variable Frequency Drives (9);<br>
7.1.0. Function:<br>
The control device of "Lubricity additive" dosing system, does the following<br>
functions, namely.<br>
(i) Control the speed of the dosing pumps(6), based on signal from a<br>
feed back means (not. shown)<br>
(li) Auto start of the standby dosing pump (6)r in case of failure of the<br>
running pump (6).<br>
(iii) Other controls<br><br>
(i) Controlling speed of the dosing pump* (6)<br>
The dosing pump (6) has manual stroke iength setting provision with a turn<br>
down ration of 10:1 ie., the stroke iength can be varied from 10% to 100%. The<br>
flow rate of the pump (6) is proportional to the stroke length set.<br>
Further, for a given stroke iength setting, the flow rate can be varied by<br>
changing the speed of operation of the pump.<br>
The initial stroke iength of the pump (6) is set as per the "ppm level'of dosing<br>
required and the flow rate of the pump (6) is further tuned by automatic speed<br>
variation of the pump based on the feed back signal with respect the Naphtha<br>
flow rate into Gas Turbine (10), which depends on the load on the Gas Turbine<br>
at that instance,<br>
The initial manual stroke length setting for various ppm levels of dosing and for<br>
various "Lubricity Additives" is given in the following table for a typical Gas<br>
Turbine. For this application, the selected capacity of the pump is 0-2 Liters per<br>
hour,<br><br><br><br><br>
Out of the total turn down requirement of l/.u.t, once the stroke length of<br>
dosing pump (6) is set based on Naphtha fuel density and required ppm level of<br>
dosing, the "lubricity Additive* flow rate only needs to be controlled with respect<br>
to Naphtha fuel flow rate into Gas Turbine corresponding to operating load on<br>
the Gas Turbine. The remaining required turn down for meeting this requirement<br>
is in the range of 4:1.<br>
Variable Frequency Drives are considered as part of a power supply system to<br>
the motors of the dosing pumps (6) for automatic changing the speed of the<br>
pomp (6), with respect to venations in Naphtha fuel flow into Gas Turbine (10),<br>
variable frequency drives have a turn down of 7;i for changing the speed of the<br>
metering pump, which is well above the required turn down of 4:1.<br>
The Naphtha flow rate into the Gas Turbine (10) is measured by a Naphtha flow<br>
meter (14). The Naphtha flow signal is fed into a "Lubricity additive: dosing<br>
control device (9).<br>
This control device (9) constitutes a dedicated PLC based pane! or the plant DCS.<br>
In the control device 'Lubricity additive* dosing rate is calculated for a given<br>
*ppm level'based on instantaneous Naphtha flow into the Gas Turbine (10) and it<br>
is used as a variable set point for the control op Lubricity additive" dosing rate.<br><br>
The "Lubricity additive" being dosed into a Gas Turbine fuel system (15) is<br>
measured by the "Lubricity additive" flow meter (8) and compared with the set<br>
flow rate, and a corrective signal will be provided to the variable frequency drive.<br>
Based on this signal, the variable frequency drive will vary the frequency of<br>
power supply to the motor of the dosing pump (6), thus changing the speed of<br>
the pump (6) and the flow rate of the dosing pump (6) is tuned to the<br>
requirement, by the control device (9).<br>
(ii) Auto Change over of dosing pumps<br>
Corresponding to the "Lubricity additive" dosing flow required, as calculated by<br>
the control device (9), a flow level at 20% lower than required is identified by<br>
the control device as low rate of closing, In case of low rate of dosing, due to<br>
failure of running of the dosing pump (6)r as measured by the "Lubricity<br>
additive" flow meter (8), the control device (9) will start the stand-by pump (6)<br>
and trip the running pump (6), thus ensuring a continuity of dosing. In case the<br>
&gt;tand-by pump (6) does not start in pre-set time, that is low-flow condition<br>
prevails, a signal will be provided to the Gas Turbine control system (12) to<br>
change over to alternate fuel by actuating a change-over valve (13), for safe<br>
operation of the Gas Turbine (10).<br>
(ii) Other controls.<br>
The control system provides additional controls as required namely,<br>
(a)	Start permissive for Gas Turbine to start on Naphtha fuel only<br>
after ensuring "Lubricity additive* dosing system is operative.<br>
(b)	Other alarms for monitoring the system.<br><br>
WE CLAIM<br>

the unloading device via a discharge hose (4), the barrel pump (2)<br>
is connected to the portable motor drive via a flexible power cable<br>
(3), the storage tank (5) provided with instrumentations for auto-<br>
change-over of gas turbine to alternate fuel, in response to<br>
alarming signals generated by the instruments provided in the<br>
storage tank (5) based on the available levels of the lubricity<br>
additives in the tank (5);<br>
-	atleast two motor driven dosing pumps (6) for metering and dosing<br>
a predetermined quantity of lubricity additives into a fuel supply<br>
device of the gas turbine (10);<br>
-	a pulsation dampener (7) for smoothening the additive flow into<br>
the system;<br>
-	a flow meter (8) to measure the flow rate of lubricity additive to<br>
the gas turbine (10) and providing a flow signal to a dosing control<br>
device (9); and<br>
-	a control device (9) for calculating the dosing rate based on<br>
instantaneous naphtha flow rate into the gas turbine (10), the<br>
device (9) transmitting corrective signals representative of the flow-<br>
rate once the flow-rate measured by the flow-meter (8)<br>
mismatches the calculated dosing rate.<br><br>
Characterised in that the system is capable of dosing lubricity additive for<br>
multiple rates of lubricity additive and for multiple loads of gas turbine by<br>
controlling the rate of flow through controlling the speed of the dosing pumps<br>
without interruption.<br>
2.	The system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the operating speed of the<br>
dosing pumps (6) is controlled by atleast one variable frequency drive<br>
allocated to a power-source providing power to the motors o the pump<br>
(6), the variable frequency drive being capable of automatically changing<br>
the speed of the pumps.<br>
