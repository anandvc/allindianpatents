				<td>HIGH DENSITY GLASS STRAND PELLETS<br>
The invention relates to the preparation of glass strand pellets by stirring<br>
glass strands. The glass strands concerned can be used to reinforce polymer-<br>
based thermoplastics, more commonly known as RTPs (for reinforced<br>
thermoplastics) and known in French as TPAs, for "thermoplastique arme". The<br>
thermoplastics concerned are especially polyolefins such as polyethylene or<br>
polypropylene, polyamides or polybutylene terephthalate.<br>
The manufacture of fiber-reinforced thermoplastics using chopped glass<br>
strands passes through a phase of compounding and mixing a thermoplastic<br>
polymer and chopped glass strands in an extruder. This preparation is performed<br>
at a high enough temperature for the polymer to be fluid enough and for the final<br>
reinforced thermoplastic composition to be as uniform as possible. Specifically, the<br>
presence of clumps of strands in the thermoplastic generally results in inferior<br>
mechanical properties (particularly in terms of impact strength) and/or a degraded<br>
surface finish.<br>
In general, the extruder performs the following functions:<br>
-it filamentizes (that is to say breaks down) the clumps of glass strands,<br>
-it compounds the glass strands with the thermoplastic matrix as uniformly as<br>
possible,<br>
-it heats the glass strands/thermoplastic compound to a temperature above the<br>
softening temperature of the thermoplastic, then produces an extruded bead of<br>
glass strands/thermoplastic compound, it being possible for said extruded bead to<br>
be cut up to turn it into pellets.<br>
The chopped (glass) strand is usually in the form of an assembly of many<br>
individual filaments. These strands form an integral whole, possibly containing, for<br>
example, from 10 to 4000 filaments. The filaments may have a diameter ranging<br>
from 5 to 24 µn, for example about 10 µm or about 14 µm.<br>
In order to make the glass strands easier to handle, attempts are made at<br>
agglomerating them, for example into the form of clumps such as pellets or<br>
granules. Indeed, such clumps are easier to handle and to meter out than<br>
traditional chopped strands. In addition, these clumps have a higher apparent bulk<br>
density and the same mass of glass strands therefore takes up a smaller amount<br><br>
of volume, something which is equally beneficial from the points of view of storage,<br>
of transport and of handling. This density, measured using the standardized ISO<br>
15100 method, needs to be high enough to give economic transport costs and<br>
easy and reliable metering on entering the extruder. The term density used in this<br>
application is indeed this apparent density determined by ISO 15100.<br>
The clumps (pellets in the case of the present invention) of chopped glass<br>
strand need to be intact enough that they do not deteriorate in use. Indeed, the<br>
various mechanical actions (transportation, unwrapping, conveying, metering) may<br>
give rise to the creation of "fines" that make the chopped strand unsuited to correct<br>
use. From another standpoint, this intactness must not be too great either because<br>
the clumps need to be opened up (that is to say broken down into individual<br>
filaments) at the appropriate moment and completely when compounded with the<br>
thermoplastic pellets in the extruder.<br>
US4840755 describes a vibration method for slightly densifying the starting<br>
strands and making them into rod-like forms. The width with which the strands<br>
arrive is practically the same as that with which they leave.<br>
WO9640595 (from the same family as US5578535) relates to a composition<br>
comprising pellets obtained by hydration in order to obtain a water content from 11<br>
to 20%, then by compounding the fibers for at least 3 minutes until pellets are<br>
formed, then drying said pellets. The ratio of the densities of the pellets to the<br>
starting strands is about 1.2 to 1.3.<br>
WO9843920 (of the same family as US5868982 and US5945134) relates to<br>
a method for manufacturing pellets involving the following successive steps:<br>
forming strands comprising a number of filaments, cutting the strands, applying a<br>
hydrating solution to the strands, dispersing the hydrating solution over the strands<br>
in a first tumbling operation in a first zone until pellets are formed, densifying the<br>
pellets by subjecting them to a second tumbling operation in a second zone. The<br>
pellets thus produced are cylindrical and have a diameter representing 20 to 65%<br>
of their length. According to that document, it is impossible to obtain sufficient<br>
densification if the operations of agglomeration (formation of pellets), on the one<br>
hand, and of densification, on the other, are not separated, by carrying them out in<br>
different apparatuses.<br><br>
WO0149627 discloses a method for manufacturing pellets comprising the<br>
following successive steps: forming strands comprising a number of filaments<br>
sized with a first precursor, chopping the strands, applying a solution of a binder<br>
containing a copolymer of maleic anhydride and another copolymerizable<br>
monomer, dispersing the solution over the strands in a first tumbling operation in a<br>
first zone until pellets are formed, densifying the pellets by subjecting them to a<br>
second tumbling operation that is not as vigorous as the first in a second zone. An<br>
increase in density by 13 to 60% by comparison with the initial chopped strands is<br>
thus obtained. It is the existence of a second tumbling operation that allows<br>
greater densification, up to 60% increase over the chopped strands used, to be<br>
obtained.<br>
The increase in productivity dictates that very harsh transport methods (for<br>
example pneumatic transport) be considered, this increase in productivity<br>
requiring, amongst other things, very high flowability properties in order to<br>
guarantee high feed rates and extremely precise metering.<br>
Usually, the conventional chopped strand has a length of 3 or 4.5 mm,<br>
these lengths having been adopted because of the good compromise achieved<br>
between intactness and density. The need to make this compromise has hitherto<br>
always prevented producers of fibers for RTP from considering longer strands (for<br>
example 9 or 12 mm strands), because then the transport and metering of such<br>
strands are not suited to the conventional extruders. However, such an increase in<br>
length would have the advantage of increasing the residual length in the<br>
composite and therefore of improving the mechanical properties of the end<br>
composite. Given the developments of extruders to screw profiles capable of<br>
keeping the longest possible lengths, it is therefore possible to envision preparing<br>
longer glass strand pellets.<br>
The invention relates to a method for preparing glass strand pellets by<br>
stirring chopped glass strands in the presence of 10 to 25 wt% of water, said<br>
strands being coated with a size containing an organosilane, said method<br>
performing stirring for long enough for the increase in density to be at least 67%,<br>
this being performed using stirring equipment that, at each instant, imparts to the<br>
strands or equipment pellets forming, the same stirring frequency, the pellets<br>
finally formed containing, after drying, at least 95wt%, or even at least 99wt% it<br><br>
contains glass, a sticky (film former) agent being in contact with the glass strands<br>
during stirring at the latest.<br>
In the pellets obtained using the invention, the "filaments" are more closely<br>
packed than in the simple fiber-forming operation using the bushing. The shape<br>
factor of the pellets leads to optimum density.<br>
The glass strands used in the context of the invention are generally<br>
manufactured using the following succession of steps:<br>
-drawing the filaments in a damp atmosphere through bushings from molten<br>
glass, then<br>
-coating the filaments with a sizing liquid, then,<br>
-gathering the filaments together into strands, then,<br>
-cutting the strands to form chopped glass strands.<br>
At this stage, the chopped strands are wet. They generally contain from 5 to<br>
25 wt% of water, for example 5 to 15 wt% of water. There is no need to dry them<br>
before introducing them into the stirring step according to the invention because<br>
this step has in any case to be performed in the presence of water. Thus, any<br>
additional water needed (with respect to the water supplied by the fiber drawing<br>
step) is added to the stirring apparatus in order to achieve a total water content<br>
(water due to the fiber drawing including the sizing water plus water added to the<br>
stirring apparatus) ranging from 10 to 25 wt% and preferably from 12 to 15 wt% of<br>
the mass introduced into the stirring apparatus. It is possible and preferable not to<br>
have to add additional water (to reduce the soiling of the pelletizer and increase<br>
the efficiency). To achieve this, all that is required is for the fiber forming to be<br>
performed at sufficient wetness to obtain correct pelletization.<br>
The sizing liquid contains at least one organosilane. This organosilane<br>
generally contains at least one reactive group capable of reacting with the hydroxyl<br>
groups at the surface of the glass to graft the modified (in that its reactive group<br>
has reacted and therefore that it has lost part of the said reactive group)<br>
organosilane to the surface of the filaments. The organosilane used for the sizing<br>
operation is generally the hydrolyzed derivative of an alkoxysilane, itself generally<br>
containing the trialkoxysilane group, that is to say -Si(OR)3, R representing a<br>
hydrocarbon radical such as a methyl or ethyl or propyl or butyl radical. The<br><br>
organosilane can therefore for example be the hydrolyzed derivative of one of the<br>
following compounds:<br>
-	Y-aminopropyltriethoxysilane<br>
-	Y-glycydoxypropyltrimethoxysilane.<br>
The organosilane is generally present in the sizing solution at a rate of<br>
0.05 wt% to 1 wt% and preferably 0.2 to 0.6 wt%. The sizing solution may also<br>
contain other ingredients, such as a film former, a lubricant, an antistatic agent.<br>
The sizing liquid may be a solution, an emulsion or a suspension.<br>
Following the sizing step, the filaments are assembled into strands<br>
generally containing 10 to 4000 filaments, then chopped to the desired length.<br>
These two steps (assembly and chopping) are known per se to those skilled in the<br>
art. This then yields chopped glass strands sized with an organosilane.<br>
In general, the chopped strands used contain less than 200 ppm (in terms of<br>
weight) of fines (comprising from 1 filament to 10 agglomerated filaments).<br>
The stirring apparatus may be any type of equipment capable of stirring the<br>
compound comprising the chopped strands without damaging them in any way. In<br>
order not to cause the strands in the pellets that are being formed to break up, the<br>
stirring must not to be too vigorous. The stirring imparts a repetitive movement to<br>
the chopped strands, then to the pellets being formed. The rotation frequency of<br>
the equipment may for example range from 10 to 50 revolutions per minute.<br>
As a preference, the stirring is a tumbling operation, which means that the<br>
strands or pellets being formed are lifted up and fall back on themselves, tumbling,<br>
and this continues until the desired pellets are obtained. The pellet must not break<br>
up as it tumbles. As a preference, tumbling carries the strands or pellets it contains<br>
at a linear speed ranging from 0.2 to 1 meter per second and preferably 0.3 to 0.7<br>
meter per second, particularly about 0.5 meter per second. This drive speed is that<br>
of the wall of the equipment coming into contact with the strands or pellets being<br>
formed in order to drive them. This linear speed can be represented by a vector<br>
tangential to the wall driving the strands or pellets, such as the vector v in figure 2.<br>
The stirring according to the invention may be achieved in a single stirring<br>
step. This means that there is no need to resort to two different stirring equipment,<br>
for example for the start of stirring on the one hand and the end of stirring on the<br>
other. The stirring can therefore be performed in the one same equipment. In<br><br>
addition, in the case of a single stirring equipment, it is not necessary to form<br>
different stirring zones by modifying, for example, the geometry of the equipment<br>
into different zones, the various zones subjecting the pellets being formed to<br>
different stirring constraints. Different stirring constraints might, for example, be<br>
more or less vigorous tumbling, that is to say tumbling at different frequencies. The<br>
stirring apparatus can therefore have just one single stirring zone. From the start<br>
to the end of the stirring operation, the chopped strands and the pellets formed or<br>
being formed may be subjected to the same constraints by the stirring apparatus,<br>
particularly since, for example, the stirring frequency is constant. Thus, the<br>
equipment may be such that it affords stirring, particularly tumbling, the frequency<br>
of which is identical at every instant for its entire contents, that is to say for the<br>
chopped strands or the pellets being formed. In the case of tumbling, the tumbling<br>
frequency is generally higher than the rotational frequency of the equipment<br>
(number of revolutions per unit time) because as can be seen in particular from<br>
figure 9, when the equipment performs one revolution, the objects inside it can<br>
tumble on themselves several times. It is considered that the equipment drives<br>
everything it contains at the same frequency because all these objects are<br>
subjected to the same stirring constraints. The equipment may also be such that it<br>
drives the strands or pellets being formed at a linear speed that is constant from<br>
the start (chopped-strand stage) to the end of the preparation of the pellets.<br>
The pellets may be prepared continuously by equipment imparting stirring at<br>
a constant frequency, from the starting chopped-strand stage right through to the<br>
end pellet stage.<br>
The equipment may also contain partitions routing the pellets being formed<br>
so as to limit the mixing between pellets in the only slightly formed state and<br>
pellets in an advanced stage of formation.<br>
The stirring equipment, more particularly the tumbling equipment, generally<br>
rotates about an axis and stirs everything it contains (from the chopped strands to<br>
the pellets) with the same frequency. At every instant, the equipment has just one<br>
rotational frequency (or radial speed of rotation). Everything that the equipment<br>
contains is stirred at the same frequency, this frequency generally being higher<br>
than the frequency of tumbling of the objects inside.<br><br>
A tumbling operation may for example be carried out in a hollow cylinder<br>
rotating about its axis of revolution. The cross section of the cylinder may be<br>
cylindrical or may have another suitable shape, for example a polygonal, for<br>
example hexagonal, shape. The axis of revolution is preferably inclined to the<br>
horizontal by an angle ranging from 0 to 45°. Such a cylinder is depicted in figure<br>
1. This cylinder comprises a tubular surface 1 and an end wall 2. In the variant of<br>
figure 1, the cylinder is not very deep (by comparison with its diameter) and could<br>
also be termed a plate. This cylinder has its axis of revolution XX' forming an angle<br>
alpha with the horizontal. This cylinder may be made to rotate about its axis of<br>
revolution by a motor 3. The chopped strands and the other ingredients of the<br>
compound are intended to be placed in the cylinder. It can be seen that the<br>
strands are tumbled and follow a path of the kind depicted in figure 2 with dotted<br>
arrows, said figure depicting the cylinder viewed in the direction of its axis of<br>
revolution, said cylinder comprising the tubular surface 1 and the end wall 2. In this<br>
variant, it is possible either to vary or not to vary the tumbling frequency during<br>
stirring. However, even if the frequency is varied during stirring, it is obvious that,<br>
at every instant, the tumbling frequency is the same for all the chopped strands<br>
and pellets contained in the equipment at the same time.<br>
It is possible to assist the tumbling with hammer blows onto the rotating<br>
tumbling apparatus (cylinder or plate). Figure 9 depicts such a variant. The<br>
hammer 10 periodically strikes the rotating apparatus 11, encouraging the strands<br>
or pellets being formed on the interior wall of the apparatus to detach. As a<br>
preference, the objects 12 contained in the apparatus tumble in the portion of<br>
angle p of about 90° between a vertical line and a horizontal line both passing<br>
through the axis of rotation.<br>
For a continuous industrial process, the cylinder may be a collection of<br>
several concentric sub-cylinders fixed one above the other, the pellets passing<br>
from one to the next through orifices. Such an assembly is depicted in figure 4, the<br>
path of the pellets being depicted using arrows. In this variant, the pellets pass<br>
from an upstream sub-cylinder to a downstream sub-cylinder having spent a<br>
certain residence time in the upstream sub-cylinder, and so on. Such circulation,<br>
by better separating the pellets according to their density, allows the spread on<br>
pellet particle size to be reduced. In addition, the proliferation of paths makes it<br><br>
possible to increase the residence time and therefore optimize the volume of the<br>
pelletizer with respect to the mass produced per unit time. The equipment<br>
therefore here contains partitions routing the pellets being formed so as to avoid,<br>
as much as possible, pellets in an early stage of formation mixing with pellets in an<br>
advanced stage of formation. Such equipment gives the same tumbling frequency<br>
(dependent on the rotational frequency of the equipment) to the chopped strands<br>
entering and to the pellets leaving. Even though everything the apparatus contains<br>
is tumbled at the same frequency, it is, however, found that the tumbled objects<br>
are distributed here over different radii and that the circumferential speed changes<br>
in each stage. It is therefore necessary for the equipment to be dimensioned and<br>
operated in such a way that the objects in the large diameters are not prevented<br>
from tumbling by centrifugal force and that the objects in the small diameters are<br>
spun fast enough that they can tumble. This apparatus therefore affords tumbling<br>
by way of stirring, the frequency of which tumbling at every instant is the same for<br>
the chopped strands (entering) and the pellets, including pellets being formed and<br>
pellets leaving. In this variant that can be used for continuous manufacture, the<br>
tumbling frequency is generally kept constant. Figures 7 and 8 show plate<br>
variants. Figure 7 shows a spiral plate, a spiral-shaped partition parallel to the axis<br>
of revolution of the plate being secured to its base. The pellets being formed follow<br>
the spiral path dictated by the partition. The pellets are placed in the middle and<br>
re-emerge at the periphery. Figure 8 shows a plate comprising a number of<br>
concentric partitions parallel to the axis of rotation of said plate, orifices in said<br>
partitions allowing the pellets being formed to pass from a volume between two<br>
partitions to an adjacent volume. This passage from one volume to the next is in<br>
the direction from the center toward the periphery.<br>
Thus, stirring can be performed in a cylinder having the shape of a plate,<br>
with a diameter larger than its depth, said plate being equipped with partitions<br>
parallel to the axis of rotation and increasing the residence time of the pellets. The<br>
stirring apparatus receives the chopped strands at the center and the pellets leave<br>
via the periphery of the plate.<br>
For a continuous industrial process it is also possible to use a hollow<br>
cylinder (a tube if the cross section of the cylinder is round) the axis of revolution<br>
of which is inclined to the horizontal and which comprises a long enough tubular<br><br>
surface for the strands being converted into pellets to travel from one end of the<br>
cylinder to the other. The cross section perpendicular to its axis of revolution may<br>
be round or have any other suitable shape, for example be polygonal, for example<br>
hexagonal. This cylinder may have a small amount of conicity (for example 5%),<br>
converging or diverging. The conicity is defined by the ratio, as a percentage<br>
(large diameter - small diameter)/length along the axis. The principle of such a<br>
cylinder is depicted in figure 3. The cylinder is inclined by an angle alpha to the<br>
horizontal 4. The chopped strands are loaded into the cylinder through one of its<br>
openings 5, the one at an elevated position by comparison with the other opening,<br>
the strands being converted into granules then following a path of the kind<br>
depicted in dotted line in figure 3, the formed pellets being recovered through the<br>
outlet opening 6, the one in the lowered position by comparison with the inlet<br>
opening 5. Such equipment is considered to have just one stirring zone because,<br>
from the start to the end of stirring, the chopped strands followed by the pellets<br>
being formed are subjected to the same stirring constraints by the equipment. The<br>
cylinder may also be a collection of several concentric sub-cylinders fixed one<br>
above the next, the pellets passing from one to the next through orifices. Such an<br>
assembly is depicted in figure 5, the path of the pellets being depicted using<br>
arrows. In this variant, the pellets pass from an upstream sub-cylinder to a<br>
downstream sub-cylinder having spent a certain residence time in the upstream<br>
sub-cylinder, and so on. Such circulation, by producing better segregation of the<br>
pellets according to their density, makes it possible to reduce the spread on the<br>
particle size of the pellets. The equipment therefore here contains partitions<br>
routing the pellets being formed in order to prevent as far as possible pellets at an<br>
early stage of formation from mixing with pellets at an advanced stage of<br>
formation. Here also, the equipment performs tumbling by way of stirring, the<br>
frequency of which tumbling at every instant is the same for the chopped strands<br>
(entering) and the pellets, including the pellets being formed and the pellets<br>
leaving. Here too, the tumbling frequency is generally kept constant and this<br>
equipment can also be used for continuous manufacture. The equipment in figures<br>
3 and 5 are examples for which the linear speed at which the strands and pellets<br>
are driven may be constant throughout the conversion of the strands into pellets.<br><br>
The stirring may also be performed in a rotating bicone such as the one<br>
depicted in figure 6. This bicone (7), equipped with an opening (8) set in rotation<br>
via a shaft (9). The axis of the bicone being able to adopt an inclination 9 that can<br>
vary according to the operation concerned: Loading with chopped strands 0=45°,<br>
adding water =0°, unloading at the end of pelletizing =90°. By way of example,<br>
this bicone can operate at a rotational frequency about the shaft 9 of 30<br>
revolutions per minute.<br>
Use may also be made of a pelleting plate, an inclined cylinder open at both<br>
ends, a fixed cylinder where the fibers are set in motion through a vortex effect.<br>
Before the stirring operation, the ingredients of the compound to be stirred<br>
are introduced into the stirring equipment. There are therefore introduced:<br>
-the chopped sized strands, and<br>
-at least one film-forming agent, and<br>
-water to represent 10 to 25 wt% of the total mass of said compound.<br>
The chopped sized strands are generally wet and therefore already<br>
contribute some of the 10 to 25% of water needed for the method according to the<br>
invention.<br>
The film-forming agent and the water are in contact with the glass strands<br>
during stirring at the latest. This means that the film-forming agent can be brought<br>
into contact with the glass strands right from the fiber-forming operation, for<br>
example during the sizing by being introduced into the sizing liquid, or may be<br>
brought into contact with the glass strands later, independently of the sizing step,<br>
by introducing it separately into the stirring apparatus, generally before stirring, or<br>
possibly during stirring.<br>
The film-forming agent may be introduced at least partially separately from<br>
the chopped strands. However, the film-forming agent may just as easily be<br>
introduced at least partially at the same time as the strands because it is carried<br>
by the strands. This is particularly the case if the sizing liquid contains film-forming<br>
agent. All the film-forming agent needed for the stirring operation can be<br>
contributed by the strands, following its application to the strands during the sizing<br>
operation. In this case, no additional amount of film-forming agent is added to the<br>
fibers after the sizing step.<br><br>
The film-forming agent may be present in an amount of 0.3 wt% to 2 wt% of<br>
the total mass to be stirred. The film-forming agent has the purpose of giving the<br>
chopped strand some cohesion (it holds the filaments together within the chopped<br>
strand). However, the film-forming agent must not prevent the filaments from<br>
separating from one another when passed through the extruder. The person<br>
skilled in the art knows which film-forming agents can be used.<br>
The film-forming agent may thus be chosen from the following compounds:<br>
-polyester,<br>
-polyurethane,<br>
-an epoxy polymer, for example a polymer of diglycidyl ether of bis-phenol<br>
A,<br>
- an epoxy-polyurethane copolymer.<br>
In particular, use may be made of Neoxil 962 by DSM.<br>
As the person skilled in the art knows, the film-forming agent needs to be<br>
selected according to the nature of the thermoplastic that is to be reinforced. For a<br>
thermoplastic of the polyester type, such as PBT or PET, use may be made of a<br>
film-forming agent of the epoxy type, particularly of a polymer of diglycidylether of<br>
bisphenol A (DGEBA). For a thermoplastic of the polyamide type, use may be<br>
made of a film-forming agent of the polyurethane type.<br>
The water may be introduced into the stirring apparatus at least partially<br>
separately from the chopped strands. However, the water is generally also<br>
introduced at least partially at the same time at the strands because it is<br>
contributed by the strands, following the sizing operation. Specifically, the cut<br>
strands are not generally dried before the stirring step. All the water needed for the<br>
stirring operation may also be contributed by the strands, following its application<br>
to the strands particularly during the sizing operation.<br>
If not all of the water needed for the method according to the invention is<br>
contributed by the strands when they are introduced into the equipment, this water<br>
can be added directly to the stirring equipment by any suitable means, particularly<br>
by spraying/atomizing or by adding steam. The addition of steam is a preferred<br>
way of adding water, when water needs to be added directly (without being carried<br>
by the strands) to the stirring equipment. This is because it has been found that<br><br>
the use of steam results in the pellets obtained being more uniform and in a higher<br>
pellet-forming rate.<br>
If water needs to be added to the stirring apparatus independently of the<br>
chopped strands, it is possible to mix it, before introducing it into the stirring<br>
equipment, with another ingredient, for example at least some of the film-forming<br>
agent. This has an advantage when it is not desirable to apply the film-forming<br>
agent to the strands during the sizing step, for example for reasons of toxicity<br>
incompatible with the fiber drawing/sizing operation, or alternatively if the film-<br>
forming agent reacts with another ingredient in the sizing composition or is<br>
detrimental to the stability of the sizing emulsion.<br>
The sizing operation may therefore contribute to the surface of the strands<br>
some or all of the amount of film-forming agent and total water needed. Typically,<br>
according to a preferred embodiment, all the amount of film-forming agent needed<br>
is introduced into the liquid with which the strands are sized and then no more<br>
need be added after the sizing operation. This is advantageous from the point of<br>
view that the entire method is simplified, and from the point of view that if a film-<br>
forming agent has to be added in a step subsequent to the sizing itself, for<br>
example by spraying, risks inherent to the handling of this kind of product, for<br>
example the risks of the spray nozzles becoming blocked, are run. In addition, if,<br>
during such a step subsequent to sizing, there is a desire to add some of the water<br>
needed as a mixture with this film-forming agent, it would not be possible to use<br>
steam for this addition.<br>
The sizing operation necessarily contributes at least some of the water<br>
needed, if not all of it. In general, water is also added directly to the stirring<br>
apparatus, independently of the strands. As the strands generally contribute water<br>
in amounts of 5 to 15 wt% of the total mass to be stirred, water is generally added<br>
directly to the stirring equipment at levels of 5 to 10 wt% of the total mass to be<br>
stirred so that 10 to 25 % and preferably 12 to 15 % of the total mass being stirred<br>
consists of water. This is pure water, that is to say containing at least 99% water.<br>
Thus, according to a preferred variant of the method, the size contributes all<br>
the film-forming agent and at least some of the water, and topping-up water is<br>
simply added directly to the stirring apparatus in the proportions just given. The<br>
size is therefore generally "complete" which means that it incorporates all the<br><br>
ingredients of a conventional sizing compound for the envisioned application, and<br>
that it is generally unnecessary to add any of these ingredients after sizing, except<br>
possibly water.<br>
The residence time that the strands spend in the stirring apparatus in order<br>
to yield pellets is generally at least 2 min, and more generally at least 4 min, and<br>
more generally at least 8 min, for example 10 min. It is possible to stir for longer,<br>
but that is unnecessary. Thus, stirring may be achieved in under 15 min. The<br>
stirring is performed for long enough to obtain the desired pellet density.<br>
The stirring is generally performed at ambient temperature.<br>
As a preference, the interior surface of the stirring equipment is<br>
hydrophobic. As a preference, the interior surface of the stirring equipment is<br>
resistant to abrasion. As a preference, the interior surface of the stirring equipment<br>
is slippery enough with respect to the moving glass strands. Such properties can<br>
be provided by a coating. This coating may be made of a hydrophobic polymer<br>
such as PTFE or PVDF. It has been found that the moving strands had less of a<br>
tendency to stick to the walls if the equipment had an interior surface made of<br>
such materials, which results in better efficiency. As a preference, the interior<br>
surface has suitable roughness, for example an Ra value of 1.5.<br>
The chopped strands are clumped together next to each other during<br>
stirring to form the pellets, without modifying their length. Thus, the pellets more or<br>
less take on the form of cylinders the lengths of which are roughly identical to the<br>
lengths of the longest strands introduced to start with.<br>
Use may be made of chopped strands with a length ranging from 1.5 to<br>
25 mm, particularly from 2 to 25 mm such as 2 to 15 mm and more particularly<br>
3 mm, 4.5 mm, 5 mm, 9 mm or 12 mm.<br>
Use may also be made, by way of strands, of a mixture of strands of<br>
different lengths.<br>
The starting chopped strands may also contain fines because these fines<br>
play an important part in the pelletization by clumping together and entering the<br>
pellets.<br>
The filaments contained in the strands may have a diameter ranging from 5<br>
to 24 µn.<br><br>
Stirring is performed for long enough to obtain the desired pellet diameter or<br>
the desired increase in density. The method according to the invention makes it<br>
possible to prepare pellets the density of which is at least 35%, or at least 50%, or<br>
at least 67%, or at least 80%, or at least 100%, or at least 130%, or even at least<br>
200% greater than the density of the starting chopped strands. In general,<br>
maximum density is obtained when the pellet diameter reaches a value roughly<br>
equal to its length.<br>
The method according to the invention makes it possible to obtain pellets<br>
having a low loss on ignition (LOI). This stems from the fact that it is possible, in<br>
the context of the present invention, to use small amounts organic compounds<br>
such as the organosilane or the film-forming agent. Thus, the pellet according to<br>
the invention may have a loss on ignition of less than 0.8% and even less than<br>
0.5%, for example ranging from 0.1 to 0.5%, particularly ranging from 0.2 to 0.4%.<br>
The final pellet can be defined as an object consisting of the close contact<br>
of many parallel glass filaments with individual diameters ranging from 5 to 24 urn,<br>
these filaments all having the same nominal diameter or having different nominal<br>
diameters. The number of filaments contained in a pellet may in particular range<br>
from 50 000 to 500 000 depending on the diameter of the filaments, for example<br>
360 000 to 500 000. The filaments are tightly packed in the pellets. Table 2 below<br>
gives examples of pellets that can be obtained using the method according to the<br>
invention:<br><br><br>
The pellet is generally in roughly cylindrical form, its approximate diameter<br>
ranging between 1 and 10 mm. In the case of a few very large pellets compared<br>
with the others, under magnification these may look like they are made up of two<br>
or three closely associated cylinders. In the case of pellets at least 9 mm long and<br>
longer, the cylinder in some cases may be slightly deformed, the filaments not<br>
being in contact over their entire length but having slipped along their axis,<br>
meaning that the pellets therefore have a length significantly greater than that of<br>
the starting chopped strands. For a basic chopped strand length (used to start<br>
with) of 12 mm, the pellets may thus lengthen into a point up to 16 mm long.<br>
These pellets therefore contain a roughly cylindrical central body, the base of each<br>
cylinder being extended by a point, like in an olive. Thus, for pellets at least 9 mm<br>
long, their length may be at least 10% greater than that of the starting chopped<br>
strands and therefore of the filaments they contain.<br>
The pellets generally have a bulk density at least 67% higher than the bulk<br>
density of the starting chopped strands. They generally have roughly the same<br>
length as said starting chopped strands, especially when the length of said pellets<br>
is less than 9 mm.<br>
The pellets contain size suited to the reinforcing of thermoplastics, said size<br>
generally having been applied to the strands before they were chopped into<br>
chopped strands.<br><br>
There is no need to form a polymer jacket around the pellets to encapsulate<br>
them. This is because the pellets produced according to the invention are intact<br>
enough to be used as they are after drying. They can therefore be used as they<br>
are (dried) to feed into an extruder (or any other suitable compounding machine)<br>
which is also fed with thermoplastic (for example PE, PP, PS) generally also in the<br>
form of pellets. The fact that they are not encapsulated means that they are<br>
broken down more readily at the time of their use in order to be compounded with<br>
the thermoplastic.<br>
Examples of batch pelletization<br>
The bicone of figure 6, which has an internal volume of 11.5 liters, is loaded with<br>
2000g of chopped strands of density "dens" (see table 1). These strands<br>
comprising about 800 to 4000 10-µm filaments have been coated with size during<br>
the fiber drawing operation using a conventional applicator roller, and a sizing<br>
liquid containing an organosilane, the hydrolyzed derivative of<br>
Y-aminopropyltriethoxysilane marketed under the reference A1100 by Crompton-<br>
OSI and a film-forming agent of the polymer of diglycidyl ether of bis-phenol A<br>
type. These strands contain x wt% water (see table 1). Their loss on ignition (LOI)<br>
is y wt%. The amount of water needed to obtain the desired moisture content (see<br>
table 1) is then added in the form of steam ("V" in table 1) or by spraying ("P" in<br>
table 1). Once the cover has been closed, the bicone is placed in a 0 = 45°<br>
position and the device is set in continuous rotation at the speed of 30 revolutions<br>
per minute for 10 minutes.<br>
The main characteristics of these examples are given in table 1 (operating<br>
conditions and results). This table gives:<br>
-the characteristics of the starting chopped strands, namely:<br>
-their length "L" in mm,<br>
-their density "Dens", measured by the ISO 15100 method,<br>
-their water content "x" in wt%,<br>
-their loss on ignition (LOI) "y" in wt%;<br>
-the way in which the water was added, namely:<br>
-the means: steam "V" or spraying "P",<br>
-the amount of water added as a wt% of the total mass for stirring,<br><br>
-the total water content at the time of stirring,<br>
-the characteristics of the end pellet, namely:<br>
-their length "L" in mm,<br>
-their density "Dens" measured using the ISO 15100 method;<br>
-the increase in density between the density of the starting chopped strands and<br>
the pellets.<br>
Example of continuous pelletization<br>
Pellets are produced using the device depicted in figure 10. After fiber drawing<br>
during which the fibers are coated with size, the strands are chopped, the chopped<br>
strands then being conveyed to the pelletization equipment in the form of a tube,<br>
the pellets then being conveyed to the drying and then screening operations, after<br>
which the pellets are packaged.<br>
The manufacturing conditions were as follows:<br>
Fiber drawing:	Bushing: 1200 holes<br>
Output: 650 kg/day<br>
Filament diameter: 10 µm<br>
Chopped strands: Cut length: 4.5 mm<br>
Loss on ignition: 0.69%<br>
Moisture content when cut: 14.5%<br>
Pelletization:<br>
Pelletizing tube length: 3.30 m<br>
Pelletizing tube : 240 mm<br>
Tube inclination: 1.9°<br>
Rotational speed: 40 revolutions per minute<br>
Tumbling aid system (hammer): 2 blows per revolution<br>
Residence time: 2 min<br>
Drying:<br>

Residence time: 2 min<br>
The chopped strands are introduced into the moving tube directly with the<br>
correct pelletization moisture content. Table 3 collates the results:<br><br><br><br><br><br>
