				<td>PROGRESSIVE ADDITION LENSES<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to multifocal ophthalmic lenses. In particular,<br>
the invention provides progressive addition lenses in which unwanted lens<br>
astigmatism is reduced. At the same time, the channel width through the<br>
intermediate and near vision zones is increased as compared to conventional<br>
progressive addition lenses.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The use of ophthalmic lenses for the correction of ametropia is well known.<br>
For example, multifocal lenses, such as progressive addition lenses ("PAL"s"), are<br>
used for the treatment of presbyopia. The surface of a PAL provides far,<br>
intermediate, and near vision in a gradual, continuous progression of vertically<br>
increasing dioptric power from far to near focus, or top to bottom of the lens. PAL"s<br>
are appealing to the wearer because PAL"s are free of the visible ledges between the<br>
zones of differing dioptric power that are found in other multifocal lenses, such as<br>
bifocals and trifocals.<br>
However, an inherent disadvantage in PAL"s is unwanted lens astigmatism,<br>
or an astigmatism introduced or caused by one or more of the lens surfaces.<br>
Generally, unwanted lens astigmatism corresponds approximately to the near vision<br>
dioptric power of the lens. For example, a PAL with 2.00 diopter near vision power<br>
will have about 2.00 diopters of unwanted lens astigmatism. Additionally, the lens<br>
area free of unwanted astigmatism when the wearer"s eye scans from the distance<br>
zone to the near zone and back is very narrow.<br>
Any number of lens designs have been tried in attempting to overcome these<br>
disadvantages. However, although the state-of-the-art progressive lens designs<br>
provide some minimal decrease in unwanted lens astigmatism, large areas in the<br>
lenses" peripheries still are unusable due to unwanted astigmatism. Thus, a need<br>
exists for a PAL that overcomes some of the problems inherent in prior art PAL"s.<br>

Description of the Invention and its Preferred Embodiments<br>
The present invention provides progressive addition lenses, as well as<br>
methods for their design and production, in which the unwanted lens astigmatism<br>
that is associated with a given near dioptric power is reduced compared to prior art<br>
lenses. Additionally, the minimum channel width of the lens of the invention is<br>
increased when compared to prior art PAL"s.<br>
For purposes of the invention, by "channel" is meant the optical zone that is<br>
free of unwanted astigmatism of about 0.75 diopters or greater, which connects the<br>
far vision zone with the near vision zone along the central umbilical meridian and is<br>
accessed by the wearer"s eye when scanning from a far object to a near object and<br>
back. By "lens" or "lenses" is meant any ophthalmic lens including, without<br>
limitation, spectacle lenses, contact lenses, intraocular lenses and the like.<br>
Preferably, the lens of the invention is a spectacle lens.<br>
It is a discovery of the invention that unwanted lens astigmatism may be<br>
reduced by combining a progressive addition surface with one or more optical<br>
elements. The optical elements provide additional dioptric power to the final lens in<br>
such a way that lens astigmatism is not increased to the level found in a conventional<br>
PAL. Further, the lens of the invention provides a minimum channel width that is<br>
increased when compared to those of current progressive addition lenses.<br>
In one embodiment, the lens of the invention comprises, consists essentially<br>
of, and consists of: a.) an optical preform comprising, consisting essentially of, and<br>
consisting of a progressive addition surface having a near vision zone and a first<br>
dioptric add power, and b.) one or more continuous optical element having a second<br>
dioptric add power at least one of the one or more optical elements disposed so as to<br>
overlap the near vision zone and wherein the dioptric add power of the lens is the<br>
sum of the first and second dioptric add powers. By "optical preform" is meant any<br>
muhifocal lens, such as a progressive addition lens, or optic. For purposes of the<br>
invention by "progressive addition surface" is meant a continuous, aspheric surface<br>
having far and near vision zones and a zone of increasing dioptric power connecting<br>
the far and near vision zones.<br>
In another embodiment, the lens of the invention comprises, consists<br>
 essentially of, and consists of: a.) an optical preform comprising, consisting<br>
essentially of, and consisting of a progressive addition surface having a near vision<br>
zone and a first dioptric add power; and b.) two or more discontinuous optical<br>
elements having a second dioptric add power at least one of the two or more<br>
discontinuous elements disposed so as to overlap the near vision zone and wherein<br>
the dioptric add power of the lens is the sum of the first and second dioptric add<br>
powers.<br>
The progressive addition surface may be on the convex or concave surface of<br>
the optical preform or in a layer between the outer concave and outer convex<br>
 surfaces of the lens. The curvature of the progressive surface increases in a positive<br>
manner from the far vision zone to the near zone. The dioptric add power of the<br>
progressive surface is the amount of dioptric power change between the far and near<br>
vision zones. The dioptric add power of the progressive addition surface used in the<br>
invention is selected to be of a value less than that needed to correct the lens<br>
 wearer"s near vision. The dioptric add power of the progressive surface may be<br>
from about + 0.01 diopters to about +3.00 diopters, preferably from about +1.00<br>
diopters to about +2.75 diopters.<br>
The dioptric add power of the progressive surface is selected based on the<br>
 total add power required for the finished lens in view of the maximum lens<br>
unwanted astigmatism associated with a given near dioptric power, the minimum<br>
channel width that is desired, and the ability to maintain a substantially cosmetically<br>
appealing lens. By "cosmetically appealing" is meant that the visibility of the<br>
optical elements of the lens are eliminated or minimized to a person viewing the lens<br>
 wearer.<br>
In order to obtain the total dioptric add power needed to correct for the<br>
wearer"s presbyopia in the lens of the invention, at least one optical element is used<br>
that provides further dioptric add power to that provided by the progressive surface.<br>
 The optical elements may be continuous, discontinuous, or a combination thereof.<br>
By "discontinuous" is meant either or both that a discontinuous changes exists in the<br>
sag value from the progressive surface to the element and from element to element<br>
or a change in the slope along the x and y axes with respect to the z axis exists from<br>
the progressive surface to optical element and from element to element. By<br>
"continuous" is meant that both the sag and slope of the element are substantially<br>
continuous or have less than or equal to about 0.00 to about 0 100 diopters,<br>
preferably less or equal to than about 0.00 to about 0.05 diopters, of discontinuity.<br>
One ordinarily skilled in the art will recognize that the optical elements<br>
useful in the invention may be spheric, aspheric, or a combination thereof and of any<br>
convenient shape. Further, it will be recognized that use of either or both continuous<br>
and discontinuous elements will result in a lens with a continuous or discontinuous<br>
surface.<br>
In embodiments in which discontinuous elements are used, two or more<br>
discontinuous elements are used which may be on the same surface as the<br>
progressive addition surface, on a surface opposite the progressive addition surface,<br>
in a layer between the progressive addition surface and the opposite surface, or any<br>
combination thereof. In embodiments in which continuous elements are used, one<br>
or more continuous elements are used which may be on a surface opposite the<br>
progressive surface, in a layer between the progressive surface and the opposite<br>
surface, or any combination thereof.<br><br>
The optical element or elements, generally, are disposed so that the near<br>
vision zone of the progressive addition surface is overlapped by at least one of the<br>
optical elements. Preferably, at least one of the elements is disposed so that the<br>
center of the optical element coincides with the center of the near vision zone of the<br>
 progressive addition surface. More preferably, at least one of the dements is<br>
disposed so that the center of the optical elements coincides with the center of the<br>
near vision zone and the center of the channel. For purposes of the invention, an<br>
element may overlap the near vision zone or coincide with the center of the near<br>
vision zone or channel without being on the same surface as the progressive addition<br>
surface.<br>
In embodiments using discontinuous elements, a sag discontinuity may cause<br>
the appearance of a line across the lens, which may be cosmetically unappealing if<br>
its magnitude exceeds certain limits. A slope discontinuity causes image doubting or<br>
disappearance that may be functionally unacceptable if its magnitude exceeds<br>
certain limits. The surface with the sag discontinuity may be coated with one or<br>
more coatings to minimize the visibility of the line. Coatings suitable for such a<br>
purpose are any coatings for use in lenses and having refractive indices that are<br>
within 20 percent of the geometric mean of the refractive indices of the lens surface<br>
coated and air.<br>
It is a discovery of the invention that the maximum range of sag<br>
discontinuities that can be obscured by coating application is about 0 to about 10<br>
microns. Thus, the range of sag discontinuities for discontinuous elements used in<br>
the invention range from about 0 to about 10, preferably about 0 to about S microns.<br>
The sag discontinuity limit corresponds to an increase in dioptric power across an<br>
element of 12 mm in length that is about 0 to about 0.12S diopters, preferably about<br>
0 to about 0.065 diopters. As to slope discontinuity, the maximum range of slope<br>
discontinuities has been discovered to correspond to an increase in dioptric power of<br>
about 0 to about 0.25 diopters, preferably about 0 to about 0.125 diopters.<br>
In view of these limits, it has been discovered that it is preferable to use at<br>
 least two, preferably about 2 to 5 discontinuous optical elements to obtain the<br>
desired increment of dioptric add power. As to spacing of the elements, slope<br>
discontinuities lead to image doubling that creates unwanted astigmatism, the<br>
magnitude of which is proportional to the slope discontinuity magnitude and the<br>
spacing between the discontinuous optical elements. The less spacing between the<br>
elements, the greater the number of images captured by a pupil scanning the optic.<br>
For example, if the discontinuous elements are 2 mm apart, a 5 mm diameter<br>
pupil will capture up to four images at the same time. The additional astigmatism<br>
associated with image blurring may be minimized if the number of images captured<br>
by the S mm pupil is kept to 2 Thus, preferably the discontinuous elements are<br>
about 3 to about 18 mm apart, preferably about 5 to about 15 mm apart. For such<br>
spacing, its has been discovered that the astigmatism associated with a 0.08 diopter<br>
slope discontinuity decreases to below 0.05 diopters and image doubling is below<br>
the perceptible level for the optic wearer. In cases in which a higher level of image<br>
blurring or astigmatism is tolerable, the spacing of elements may be closer<br>
Each discontinuous optical element may be of the same or, preferably, of a<br>
different dioptric power. In embodiments using discontinuous elements, preferably<br>
two or more elements are used and the dioptric power changes as one moves from a<br>
 first to a second to a third element, and so forth. However, the increase in power<br>
from element to dement, preferably, is such that the wearer"s perception of the<br>
change in dioptric power is minimized or eliminated. Generally, the change in<br>
dioptric power moving from element to element is less than about 1 .SO diopters,<br>
preferably less than about 0.S0 diopters, more preferably less than about 0.37<br>
 diopters, and most preferably less than about 0.2S diopters.<br>
The dioptric power for each element is determined by the radius of curvature<br>
of the element, dioptric power increasing as the curvature of the element is<br>
decreased. Thus, each element may provide additional dioptric add power to the<br>
 optical preform ranging from about +0.01 diopters to about +3.00 diopters,<br>
preferably from about +0.01 to about +2.00 diopters, more preferably from about<br>
+0.01 to about +0.50 diopters, most preferably from about +0.03 to about +0.25<br>
diopters. The dioptric add power for the optical element is the incremental add<br>
power provided by the element, which power one ordinarily skilled in the art will be<br>
readily able to determine.<br>
For example, in FIG. 1, the change in dioptric power from element to<br>
element is 0 25 diopters and the dioptric power of the elements is +0.25 diopters for<br>
the uppermost element 12, +0.50 diopters for the second element 13, and +0.75<br>
diopters for the third element 14. Thus, the dioptric add power of the optical<br>
elements is +0.75 diopters. As another example, in FIG 2, the dioptric power of the<br>
concave surface elements 22,23, and 24 is +0.25, +0.50, and +0.75, respectively and<br>
that of the convex surface elements 25 and 26 is +0.12 and +0.24 diopters,<br>
respectively. Therefore, the total dioptric add power of the elements of the lens is<br>
+0.99 diopters. In the lens of the invention, the dioptric add power of the dements<br>
may range from about +0.01 to about +3.00 diopters, preferably about +0 25 to<br>
about +2.00 diopters.<br>
In embodiments of the lens of the invention in which the increase in power<br>
between optical elements results in sag discontinuities across the channel,<br>
preferably, the sag discontinuity is set to about 0 microns in the middle of the<br>
channel by adjusting the relative heights of the elements. The overall sag<br>
discontinuity along the vertical lines of the elements may be reduced by introducing<br>
a very small angle, the segment angular discontinuity, at the horizontal segment<br>
boundaries.<br>
The location and geometry of the elements may be specified by any known<br>
technique. For example, location and geometry may be evaluated, designed, and<br>
specified using ray tracing or measured test results on lenses. Additionally, the<br>
 surfaces bound by the elements may be optimized by any known process for best<br>
imaging performance. For example, such optimization may be performed using<br>
commercially available optical design software.<br>
In FIG. 6 is depicted one preferred embodiment of the location of the<br>
discontinuous optical elements used in the lens of the invention. Distance viewing<br>
zone 61 is shown along with discontinuous optical elements 62,63, and 64. In this<br>
embodiment, the optical elements are aligned so that their centers coincide with the<br>
center of the channel and the near vision zone of the progressive addition<br>
surface, which surface and zone is not shown in FIG. 6. The progressive addition<br>
surface has a dioptric add power of +1.25 diopters and the optical elements a<br>
dioptric add power of +0 75 diopters. The power profile for the FIG. 6 embodiment<br>
is depicted in FIG. 7, with points E1, E2, and E3 corresponding to elements 62, 63,<br>
and 64, respectively. The sloping increase in power is due to the +1 25 dioptric add<br>
power of the progressive surface and the steps at points, E1, E3, and E3 are caused by<br>
the change in curvature of the discontinuous elements.<br>
FIGS. 2, 3 and 5 illustrate two shapes useful for the discontinuous optical<br>
elements of the invention, a step shape and a circular "bulls-eye" shape. The<br>
elements may be formed by any known method. Suitable methods include, without<br>
limitation, grinding, molding, casting, diamond tooling, milling, polishing,<br>
thermoforming, or a combination thereof. In addition to the optical elements and<br>
progressive surface, other surfaces, such as spheric and tone surfaces, designed to<br>
adapt the lens to the ophthalmic prescription of the lens" wearer may be used.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, as depicted in FIG. 2, the concave<br>
surface 21 of optical preform 20 is a progressive addition surface with an add power<br>
of+1.00 diopters. Discontinuous, aspheric optical elements 22, 23, and 24 are<br>
placed on concave surface 21 and elements 25 and 26 on convex surface 27. In this<br><br>
For element 43, having a dioptric power of +0.725 diopters, 0.725 divided by 5.86<br>
equals a dioptric power of +0.125 diopters for element 43. The dioptric add power of<br>
the optical elements is +0.50 diopters, making the total dioptric add power of the<br>
FIG. 5 lens +2.00 diopters.<br>
In FIG. 8 is depicted an embodiment of the lens of the invention in which<br>
continuous elements are used. Optical preform 70 is shown with progressive addition<br>
convex surface 71 with a distance viewing zone 74, near viewing zone 75 and<br>
intermediate zone 77. The dioptric add power of the progressive surface is +1.60<br>
diopters. Concave surface 72 is shown with a spherical zone 76 and continuous<br>
optical elements 73 located orthogonal to zone 75. The dioptric add power of the<br>
optical elements 73 is +0.40 diopters. Convex surface 71 has a curvature of 4.50<br>
diopters in zone 74 and a curvature of 6.10 diopters in zone 75. Concave surface 72<br>
has a curvature of 4.50 diopters in zone 76 and 4.10 diopters at 73. The resulting<br>
lens has a dioptric add power of +2.00 diopters, the sum of the dioptric add powers of<br>
the progressive addition surface and that of continuous optical element 73.<br>
FIG. 9a and FIG. 9b depict yet another embodiment of the lens of the<br>
invention using continuous optical elements. Lens 80 is shown having optical<br>
preform 81 with convex surface 82, a progressive surface, having distance viewing<br>
zone 85, near viewing zone 86, and intermediate zone 88 of continuously increasing<br>
dioptric power. Concave surface 83 has spherical zone 87, a distance viewing zone.<br>
Continuous optical element 84 is located orthogonal to near viewing zone 86.<br>
 Continuous element 84 is a progressively changing dioptric power between zone 87<br>
and the edge 89 of the preform. Convex surface 82 has a curvature of 4.50 diopters<br>
in zone 85 and 6.00 diopters in zone 86. Concave surface 83 has a curvature of 4.50<br>
diopters in zone 86 and 4.00 diopter at point A, the central point of element 84. The<br>
resulting lens has a dioptric add power of 2.00 diopters. In FIG. 9b is shown the<br>
 power profile of optical element 84. The solid line depicts the power profile of<br>
element 84 compared to a profile of discontinuous, concentric elements shown as<br>
the dotted line.<br>
FIG. 9b depicts the blended concentric power profile of element 84. This<br>
profile has zones of constant power that are smoothly connected to each other by<br>
aspheric or blended radii or curvature. This blending results in a continuous sag.<br>
radius, and power profile across the element.<br>
Fig. 10a and FIG. 10b depict still another embodiment of a lens of the<br>
invention using continuous elements. Lens 90 is shown having optical preform 91<br>
with convex surface 92. Convex surface 92 has distance viewing zone 9, near<br>
viewing zone 96 and an intermediate zone 97 of progressively increasing dioptric<br>
power. Concave surface 93 has distance viewing zone 98 and continuous optical<br>
element 94 orthogonal to near viewing zone 96. The continuous element 94 is of a<br>
progressively changing dioptric power between zone 98 and edge 99.<br>
Convex surface 92 has a curvature of 4.50 diopters in zone 95 and 5.50<br>
diopters in near zone 96. Concave surface 93 has a curvature o 4.50 diopters in zone<br>
98 and 3.50 at point B, the center of zone 94. Lens 90, thus, has a dioptric add power<br>
of 2 00 diopters. FIG. 10 b depicts the power profile of lens 90 as a solid line<br>
compared to discontinuous, concentric optical elements.<br>
FIG. 10b depicts an aspheric power profile for the continuous element. In<br>
this profile, there is not point at which he radius of curvature is a constant, but rather<br>
the radius changes smoothly from the center of the element to its edge. For the<br>
embodiment depicted in FIG. 10a, and as seen in FIG 10b, the power profile<br>
intersects the reference discontinuous concentric profile at the mid-point of each<br>
 concentric zone.<br>
embodiment, and preferably, the upper boundary of the topmost convex surface<br>
element 25 is aligned with the bottom boundary of the topmost concave surface<br>
element 22." In FIG. 2, the dioptric power of elements 25 and 26 are +0.12 and<br>
+0.24 diopters, respectively, and that of the elements 22, 23, and 24 are +0.25,<br>
+ 0.50, and +0.75 diopters, respectively. Therefore, the total add power for the lens<br>
will be (+0.24 diopters) + (+0.75 diopters) + (+1.00 diopters) or +1.99 diopters. In<br>
the embodiment depicted in FIG. 2, tone surface 28 is cast onto convex surface 27<br>
of the optical preform to provide the final desired lens. In such an embodiment, in<br>
which either the concave or convex surface is provided with a tone correction,<br>
preferably, at least one intermediate layer 29 is provided in the lens that is spherical<br>
in geometry.<br>
As to FIG. 2, because only the +1.00 dioptric add power of the optical<br>
preform"s progressive addition surface contributes to the lens astigmatism, the +1.99<br>
dioptric add power of the lens is achieved with introduction of less lens astigmatism<br>
than that formed in a conventional +1.99 add PAL. For a prior art PAL, with a<br>
+1.99 add, the lens astigmatism would result in approximately +1.99 diopters of lens<br>
astigmatism. Therefore, lens astigmatism of the lens of the invention of FIG. 2 is<br>
reduced as compared to a prior art progressive lens. Further, the channel through the<br>
intermediate and near vision zones of the lens is increased in width.<br>
In the embodiment depicted in FIG. 2, optical elements 25 and 26 are buried<br>
within the lens in a layer between the convex and concave surfaces of the lens. In<br>
this embodiment, preferably, the surface with the buried elements is of a different<br>
refractive index than the toric surface 29. The difference in the surfaces" refractive<br>
indices is about 0.05 to about 0.50, preferably about 0.1 to about 0.35.<br>
Preferably, a majority, or all as depicted in FIG. 3, of the elements 31, 32,<br>
and 33 are located on concave surface 34 of optical preform 30, which surface is<br>
also the concave surface of the lens shown, or in a layer between the concave<br>
suffice 34 and convex surface 35 of the final lens. In an alternative preferred<br>
embodiment, the elements are located on the concave lens surface and in a layer<br>
between the concave and convex surfaces of the lens. In such embodiments,<br>
preferably, the surfaces or layers containing the optical elements are of different<br>
refractive indices than those surfaces or layers without the optical elements. The<br>
reason that such placement is preferred is that it provides a more cosmetically<br>
appealing lens in that the visibility of the elements to one viewing the lens wearer is<br>
eliminated or minimized.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, another embodiment of the lens of the invention is<br>
shown. The y axis of lens 10 represents the principal meridional line bisecting lens<br>
10 in a generally vertical direction. The x axis represents the y = 0 line of lens 10.<br>
Distance viewing zone 11 is shown. A progressive surface, with a dioptric<br>
add power +1.00 and which underlies optical elements 12, 13, and 14, is not shown.<br>
The change in dioptric power between elements 12 and 13 and 13 and 14 is 0.25<br>
diopters. The dioptric power of element 12 is +0.25, of element 13 is +0.50, and of<br>
element 14 is +0.75 diopters. The total dioptric add power of lens 10, thus, is +1.75<br>
diopters.<br>
The uppermost boundary of the optical elements may be located on or below<br>
 the y = 01ine, or the 0-180 degree line. Generally, the optical elements are<br>
positioned such that the upper edged of the element or elements is located between<br>
about 0 and about 18.5 mm and the lower edge of the element or dements is located<br>
between about 5 to about 35 mm below the y = 0 line. FIG. 1 depicts a preferred<br>
embodiment, the uppermost boundary of the optical elements being located below<br>
 about 2 mm below the y = 0 line of the lens.<br>
FIG. 4 is a schematic view of the surface topography of the lower left<br>
quadrant of the lens of FIG. 6. Horizontal line 65, a cut through the middle of lens<br>
60 at y = 0, mid channel 66, bottom edge 67, and peripheral edge 68 of the lens are<br>
shown. From FIG. 4, it is seen that the discontinuous elements 62, 63, and 64 have<br>
significantly different curvatures from the surrounding lens areas and from each<br>
other. These elements are designed so that the sag is continuous along the y axis.<br>
However, due to the different curvatures of the elements, a sag discontinuity<br>
increases approximately quadratically away from the y axis and is seen as horizontal<br>
discontinuities 81, 82, and 83. To the left of elements 62, 63, and 64 is seen vertical<br>
discontinuities, such as vertical discontinuity 84.<br>
To reduce the vertical discontinuities, segment angular discontinuities are<br>
introduced into the lens, the function of which is to reduce the magnitude of the<br>
vertical discontinuities, such as 84. The segment angular discontinuity between<br>
distance zone 61 and element 62 is 0.001 radians and that between elements 62 and<br>
63 is 0.0025 radians. No segment angular discontinuity exists between elements 63<br>
and 64. The segment angular discontinuities are not sufficiently large to be depicted<br>
in FIG. 4.<br>
i<br>
The horizontal and vertical discontinuities may provide practical limits to the<br>
width of the discontinuous elements useful in the invention. For a given<br>
discontinuity in power, the horizontal sag discontinuity increases in a quadratic<br>
function, such as x^2, away from the channel. Thus, if the horizontal sag<br>
 discontinuity is to be kept below a desired specified value, this condition will place a<br>
limit on the width of the discontinuous element. Similar consideration will apply to<br>
the vertical discontinuities as well as the prism introduced by the discontinuities.<br>
In Fig. 5 is illustrated yet another embodiment of the lens of the invention,<br>
 Concave surface 41 of optical preform 40 and convex surface 41 are shown.<br>
Convex surface 42 is a progressive surface of a 1.50 dioptric add power. Optical<br>
elements 43-46 are provided being +0.725, +1.45, +2.175, and +2.90 diopters,<br>
respectively. The elements are spaced 4 mm apart. Each element has a circular<br>
section formed by the intersection of two spheres of two different radii of curvature.<br>
For example, element 43 is formed by the intersection of the surface base sphere, 41<br>
(83.00 mm) and a sphere of radius 92.4 mm. Because the optical element provides<br>
an incremental add power on the concave surface 41, the curvature is flatter, i.e., the<br>
radius of curvature of the element is larger than that of the base sphere. Similarly,<br>
element 44 is a second circular section concentric with element 43 and formed by<br>
the intersection of the sphere of radius 92.4 mm with a third sphere of radii of<br>
curvature equal to 105.6 mm. Thus, the discontinuous elements of FIG. 5 are<br>
arranged in the form of a nested set of spherical sections the radii of which are<br>
collinear. The refractive index of optical preform 40 is 1.586. Optical elements 43-<br>
46 are formed in optical preform 40. A layer will be cast onto the concave surface<br>
41 of optical preform 40. The refractive index of this cast layer will differ from that<br>
of optical preform 40 by 0.1 units.<br>
In such a case, the dioptric power of the optical elements will be affected as<br>
follows. The dioptric power of each optical element will be scaled by dividing the<br>
dioptric power for a given element by x, where:<br>
wherein n1 is the refractive index of the optical preform and n2 is the refractive index<br>
of the cast layer. For FIG. 5.<br>
