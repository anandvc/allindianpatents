				<td>aste-like Masses for Electrochemical Elements and Layers and Electrochemical Elements Produced Therefrom<br>
The present invention relates to novel materials with electrochemical properties, in particular paste-like masses, layers produced from these paste-like masses that are self-supporting or that are placed on a substrate, and composite layers produced therefrom that can be used as accumulators, etectrochromlc elements, or the like. The invention particularly relates to rechargeable electrochemical cells on a fixed body base.<br>
Since the beginning of the 1970's there have been attempts to produce electrochemical elements such as accumulators or the like in the form of thin layers. The goaf has been to obtain composite films that are both flexible enough that they can be, for instance, rolled up or made to conform to another desired shape and that also have particularty good charging and discharging properties due to an extremely high contact area between the individual electrochemical components, such as electrodes and electrolytes, relative to the volume of active electrochemical material used.<br>
tn the past, attempts to produce such electrode materials have begun with solid or viscous liquid Teflon, which is mixed with a certain percentage of carbon and the actual electrode material and is then pressed or sprayed onto suitable reference electrodes. However, this<br>
-1 -<br><br>
results in layers that have insufficient flexibility. In addition, it has been suggested that electrode layers be produced that are manufactured with PVC and tetrahydrofurane or another polymer dissolved in a solvent and that the solvent subsequently be extracted therefrom. However, the conductivity of products produced in this manner is not favorable.<br>
Producing a layer that can function in an appropriate electrochemical composite as an electrolyte presents particular problems. US 5 466 000 describes rechargeable battery ceils that are produced by laminating electrode and electrolyte cells. Used for the positive electrode is a film or membrane that is produced separately from LiMn2O4 powder in a matrix solution made of a copolymer and is then dried. The negative electrode comprises a dried coating of a pulverized carbon dispersion in a matrix solution of a copolymer. An electrolyte/separator membrane is arranged between the electrode layers. For this purpose a poly(vinylidene fluoride)-hexafluoropropylene copolymer is converted with an organic plasticizer such as propylene carbonate or ethylene carbonate. A film is produced from these components and then the plasticizer is extracted from the layer. The battery cell is maintained in this "inactive" condition until it is to be used. In order to activate it, it is immersed in a suitable electrolyte solution, whereby the cavities formed by extracting the plasticizer are filled with<br>
-2-<br><br>
the liquid electrolytes. The battery is then ready for use.<br>
Such a construct is disadvantageous in that the battery cannot be maintained for extended periods in a charged condition because corrosion occurs at the limit surfaces (see oral presentation made by A. Btyr et at., 4th Euroconference on Solid State Ionics, Conrtemara, Ireland, September 1997, provided for publication). The use of a liquid electrolyte thus entails stability problems at the phase limits in the composite layer. Another disadvantage is that the battery must be arranged in a housing that Is leak-proof.<br>
There have already been attempts to use solid electrofytes. It has been suggested that ion-conducting organic polymer materials be used (so-called true polymer electrolytes). Thus, US patent 5 009 970 describes using a gel product that is obtained by converting a soiid poly(ethylene oxide) polymer with lithium perchlorate and then irradiating it. US patent 5 041 346 describes an oxymethylene cross-linked variant of these polymer electrolytes that also contains a softener that preferably has ion-solvating properties, for example, that can be a dipolar aprotic solvent such as g-butyrolactone. However, it has been reported that although the ion conductivity compared to pure solid lithium is drastically elevated, it is still not sufficient for use as an electrolyte layer in electrochemical elements.<br>
Another attempt related to similar polymer electrolytes.   In this<br>
-3-<br><br>
case polyvinylfluoride polymers and related fluorocarbon copolymers were used with trifluoroethylene or tetrafluoroethylene. Added to these polymers were lithium salts and additional organic solvents that were compatible both with the polymers and with the salt components (Tsuchida et al., Elektrochtmtca Acta, Volume 28 (1983, page 591 ff and page 833 ff). However, in this case a usable ion conductivity of greater than about 10-5S/cm can only be obtained at elevated temperatures because, as the authors themselves reported, this mixture did not remain homogeneous; rather, it formed salt and polymer crystallite. Research in this direction was therefore later deemed unpromising (see US 5 466 000, column 2, lines 31 through 33),<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide masses for producing electrochemical elements in the form of thin composite layers that do not have the aforesaid unfavorable properties. In particular the inventive masses, when processed into layers or composite layers with electrochemical properties, should provide products such as rechargeable batteries (accumulators), electrochromfc elements, or the like, that have a high degree of flexibility and very good electron- and ion-conducting properties and that furthermore cannot leak and therefore do not have to be maintained in housings, especially in sealing housings.<br>
This object is achieved in that, in accordance with the invention,<br>
-4-<br><br>
paste-like masses that can be used in electronic elements are prepared that include a heterogeneous mixture of (A) a matrix containing or comprising at least one organic polymer, precursors thereof, or prepolymers thereof, and (8) an inorganic material that can be efeetrochemicalty activated, is not soluble in the matrix, and is In the form of a solid substance.<br>
The term "that can be used in electrochemical elements" implies that the electrochemically activatable inorganic material that is in the form of a solid substance must be an ion-conducting or electron-conducting material that Is suitable for electrode material or for a solid electrolyte.<br>
In accordance with the invention at least one additional condition must be satisfied so that there is sufficient electrical contact between the individual grains of the electrochemtcally activatable solid substance (B) that is embedded in the matrix (A). Namely, it has been demonstrated that the poor conductivity described in the prior art cannot be overcome unless the mass contains a sufficient quantity of electrochemically activatable solid substance. Very good conductivity, or even sufficient conductivity, cannot be achieved unless the proportional volume of the electrochemically activatable solid substance is so high that It is approximately equal to the filled space in a theoretical close-pack.   The minimum can vary somewhat depending<br>
-5-<br><br>
on the materials used, since naturally parameters such as size and eternal shape of the electrochemically activatable solid substance (B) obviously play a role. However, it is recommended that at least 60 volume % of solid substance (B) be used, preferably a minimum of about 65 volume %, and particularly preferably a minimum of about 70 volume %, The upper limit is not critical; it depends primarily on the properties of the matrix (A). !f it {the matrix] has very good adhesion, it is possible to work into the paste-like mass up to 90 volume %, in exceptional cases even up to 95 volume %, of solid substance (B).<br>
However, alternatively or in addition, it is also possible to achieve sufficient electrical contact between the grains of the solid substance (B) in that a second ion and/or electron-conductor (or a homogeneous, mixed conductor, depending on the type of conductivity needed) (C) is used that is present as a thin layer, at least at the grain limits between (A) and {B}.<br>
Additional conditions in accordance with claim 1, variant (a) or (b), must be met if the solid substance (B) is an electrode material.<br>
The invention is also explained in greater detail with respect to the drawings, in which<br>
Figure 1 illustrates the sequence of an Inventive composite layer with electrochemical properties;<br>
Figure 2 illustrates a composite layer in accordance with Figure<br>
-6-<br><br>
1 that has been rolled up;<br>
Figure 3 illustrates charge and discharge curves for an inventive embodiment using lithium technology with the layers in the sequence illustrated in Figure 1; and,<br>
Figures 4a and 4b (the latter with cycles excerpted and enlarged) illustrate charge and discharge curves (voltage/time) of accumulators in accordance with the invention (negative electrode: graphite; positive electrode: lithium cobalt oxide).<br>
Surprisingly it could be determined that, due to the measures in accordance with claim 1, upon which the invention is based, it is possible to substantially reduce the irreversible losses that necessarily occur during charging and discharging. Charging and discharging are symmetrical and reproducible, as can be seen in Figures 4a and 4b.<br>
The mass obtains its paste-like consistency by using a suitable matrix (A). The term "paste-like" means that the mass, once it has been produced, can be processed using current paste application methods, for example, it can be applied to a base using a brush, spatula, rake, or various pressure methods. Depending on the need, the mass can be made to be relatively thin to very viscous.<br>
A plurality of materials can be used for the matrix (A). Systems containing solvents or solvent-free systems can be used. Solvent-free systems that are suitable are, for example, cross-linkable liquid or<br>
-7-<br><br>
paste-like resin systems. Examples are resins made of cross-linkable addition polymers or condensation resins. For instance, pre-condensates of phenoplasts (novolak) or aminoplasts can be used that are final-polymerized to the layer of an electrochemical composite layer after the paste-like mass has been formed. Additional examples are unsaturated polyesters, such as polyester that can be cross-linked to styrene by graft copolymerization, polycarbonates that can be cross-linked by bifunctional epoxy resins that are bifunctional reaction partner curable (for example bisphenol A epoxy resin, cold cured wrth polyamide), polyisocyanurate that can be cross-linked by a polyol, and binary polymethyl methacrylate, which can also be polymerized with styrene. The paste-like mass is formed from the more or less viscous precondensate or non-cross-linked polymer for matrix (A) or using essential components thereof, together with the component (B).<br>
Another option is to use polymers or polymer precursors together with a solvent or swelling agent for the organic polymer if the solid substance (8) is not an electrode material. In principle there is no limit in terms of the synthetic or natural polymers that can be used. Not only can polymers with carbon main chains be used, but also polymers with heteroions in the main chain, such as polyamides, polyesters, proteins, or polysaocharides.  The polymers can be homopoiymers or<br>
-8-<br><br>
copolymers. The copolymers can be statistical copolymers, graft copolymers, block copolymers, or polyblends  there is no limitation. In terms of polymers with a pure carbon main chain, natural or synthetic rubbers can be used, for instance. Particularly preferred are fluorinated hydrocarbon polymers such asTeflon, poly(vinylidene fluoride) (on PVDF) or polyvinyl chloride, since these make it possible to obtain particularly good water-repellant properties in the films or layers formed from the paste-like mass. This imparts particularly good long-term stability to the electrochemical elements thus produced. Additional examples are polystyrene or poiyurethane. Examples of copolymers are copolymers of Teflon, amorphous fluoropolymers, and poly(vinylidene fluoride)/hexafiuoropropylene (commercially available as Kynarflex). Examples of polymers with heteroatoms in the main chain are polyamides of the diamine dicarboxylic acid type or of the amino acid type, polycarbonates, polyacetals, polyethers, and acrylics. Additional materials include natural and synthetic polysaccharides (homeoglycans and heterogfycans), proteoglycans, for example, starch, cellulose, methylcellulose. In addition, substances such as chondroitin sulfate, hyaluronic acid, chitin, natural or synthetic wax, and many other substances can be used. In addition, the aforesaid resins (precondensates) can be used in solvents and diluents.<br>
One skilled in the art is familiar with solvents and swelling agents<br>
- 9 o<br><br>
for the aforesaid polymers.<br>
A plasticizer (also softener) can be present for the polymer or polymers used regardless of whether or not the matrix (A) contains a solvent or swelling agent. "Plasticizer" or "softener" should be understood to include substances whose molecules are bonded to the plastic molecules by coordinate bonds (Van der Waals forces). They thus diminish the interacting forces between the macromolecules and therefore lower the softening temperature and the brittleness and hardness of the plastics. This is different from swelling agents and solvents. Due to their higher volatility, it is generally also not possible to remove them by evaporating them out of the plastic. Rather, they must be extracted using an appropriate solvent. Using a plasticizer effects high mechanical flexibility in the layer that can be produced from the paste-like mass.<br>
One skilled in the art is familiar with suitable softeners for each of the plastics groups. They must be highly compatible with the plastic into which they are to be worked. Common softeners are high-boiling esters of phthalic acid or phosphoric acid, such as dibutyl phthalate or dioctyphthalate. Also suitable are, for instance, ethylene carbonate, propylene carbonate, dimethoxyethane, dirnethylcarbonate, diethyl carbonate, butyrolactone, ethylmethytsuifon, polyethylene glycol, tetraglyme, 1,3-dioxolane, orS.S-Dialkyldithiocarbonate.<br>
-10-<br><br>
if a combination of plastic ami piasticizer is used for the matrix, the piasticizer can then be extracted (or should be extracted, if only the features of claim variation 1b are used) from the paste-like mass using an appropriate solvent. The cavities that now occur are closed during the subsequent conversion of the mass into an efectrochemically active or acdvatable layer by pressure or laminating processes for combining the various layers. This improves the electrochemical stability of the charged accumulator. When solid electrolytes are used in the described plastic matrix it is desirable to achieve ionic conductivity of at feast 10-4 cm.<br>
Instead of later compressing the cavities, they can also be filled with a second solid electrolyte or electrode material once the piasticizer has been extracted.<br>
As stated in the foregoing, these inventive paste-tike masses and layers produced therefrom are suitable for a plurality of electrochemical elements. One skilled in the art can select the same solid substances (B) that he would use for classic electrochemical elements, that is, substances to which no plastics have been added.<br>
The following solid substances are examples of options that can be used for lithium-technology accumulators:<br>
lower contact electrodes	Al, Cu, Pt, Au, C<br>
positive electrode	Lif, LixNIVO4, LixMn]O4<br>
-11-<br><br><br><br>
negative electrode<br><br>
upper contact electrodes<br>
However, of course, the present invention is not limited to lithium-technology accumulators, but rather, as stated in the foregoing, includes all systems that can be produced using "conventional" technology, that is, without working in an organic polymer matrix.<br>
The following describes a few special embodiments of the paste-like masses that are suitable for special elements or element parts. For those electrochemicaily activatable parts that are not prior art, it should<br>
-12-<br><br>
be clear that these substances can also be used in "bulk form", i.e., without the polymer matrix, in appropriate electrochemical elements.<br>
Appropriately selecting the electrochemically active substances makes it possible to produce electrochemical elements, such as accumulators, whose characteristics in the charge/discharge curves make it possible to control the charge/discharge status of the accumulator. Thus mixtures of two of the electrode materials cited in the forgoing, or of other appropriate electrode materials, can be used for the electrochemically activatabie solid substance (B) for the positive or negative electrodes, the mixtures having different oxidation and reduction stages. Alternatively one of the two substances can be replaced with carbon. This leads to characteristic segments in the charge/discharge curves that make it possible to advantageously detect the charge or discharge status of an accumulator produced using such masses. The curves have two different plateaus. If the plateau that is near the discharge status is achieved, this status can be indicated to the user so that he knows that he will soon need to recharge, and vice versa.<br>
If carbon and an element that can be alloyed with lithium is worked into a paste-like mass provided for a negative electrode, this imparts to the electrode that can be produced therefrom (with properties of an alloy electrode or intercalation electrode) a particularly<br>
-13-<br><br>
high capacity that has improved electrochemical stability. In addition, the expansion in volume is lower than in a pure intercalation electrode.<br>
Furthermore, graphite or amorphous carbon (carbon black) or a mixture of the two can be worked into the paste-like mass with electrode material for a positive or negative electrode. Particularly advantageous in this regard are weight proportions of 20 to 80% by weight amorphous carbon relative to the electrochemically activatable components. If the mass is provided for a positive electrode, the lubricating effect of the carbon is an advantageous property that improves the mechanical flexibility of a layer produced from the paste-like mass. If the mass is provided for a negative electrode, the electrochemical stability and electronic conductivity is improved, as has been described in the foregoing.<br>
The inventive paste-like mass can also be used for other electrodes as intercalation electrodes. One example of this is the use of metal powder combined with an alkali or earth alkali salt as the electrochemically activatable solid substance (B). A paste-like mass produced with this combination can be used to produce decomposition electrodes. The expansion in volume that is typical for intercalation electrodes does not occur in this case, which leads to improved service life over time. An example of this is combining copper and lithium sulfate.<br>
-14-<br><br>
A very particular electrode variant can be obtained when the electrode material (B) is a metal that does not react with lithium and that contains a lithium salt. The matrix (A) in this variant is produced as described in the foregoing from a combination of plastic with a plasticizer that is later extracted from the paste-like mass. In this variant, however, the cavities that then occur are not subsequently closed under pressure during lamination of the electrochemically activatable layers. On the contrary, care is taken that they remain open. When combined with a lithium salt in the adjacent electrolyte layer, an electrode thus comprised has the property of being able to reversibfy introduce and spread lithium in the cavities that occur. It has the advantages of an intercalation electrode, but avoids the disadvantages of such an electrode (for example, expansion in volume) and has excellent electrical properties due to the large interior surface. An example of a metal that does not react with lithium is nickel.<br>
Surprisingly it has also been demonstrated that working a phase mixture comprising Li4Si04  Li3PO4 into the inventive paste-like mass, regardless of intended electrochemical application, leads to an improvement in the plasticity of the electrodes or solid electrolyte produced therefrom. This requires that the phase mixture be ground extremely fine. The extremely small grain sizes must be the reason for improved internal sliding effect.<br>
-15-<br><br>
Regardless of whether the solid substance (B) is an electrode material or an electrolyte material, it can comprise one lithium ion conductor and one or more additional ion conductors (Li, Cu, Ag, Mg, F, Cl, H). Electrodes and electrolyte layers made of these substances have particularly favorable electrochemical properties such as capacity, energy density, and mechanical and electrochemical stability.<br>
In accordance with claim 1(c), if the paste-like mass of the present invention is additionally to contain a second solid ion, electron, and/or mixed conductor (C), it can be worked into the matrix in different ways. If it is an ion conductor that is soluble in a solvent (such as the solvent in which the matrix material (A) is also soluble), the paste-like mass can be produced in that the solvent for the matrix material contains this second ion conductor. The vapor pressure of the solvent must be low enough that it can be extracted or can evaporate in a subsequent stage (for example after the components of the mass are thoroughly mixed, if the mass also has a paste-like consistency absent the solvent, or after producing the layer or film). When in such an embodiment of the invention a plasticizer is also present, it is possible to select a plasticizer that is also soluble in the solvent and that subsequently can also be removed using said solvent. This embodiment of the invention can also be produced with conductors (C) that have relatively poor conductivity (especially ion conductivity, if the<br>
-16-<br><br>
intent is to have this property).<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention in accordance with claim 1(c), an ion, electron, or mixed conductor (C) is selected that is soluble in the plasticizer that is selected for the system. In this case, the plasticizer should have a relatively low vapor pressure. When component (C) dissolved in plasticizer is thoroughly mixed with the other components of the paste-like mass this produces a modified grain limit between the conducting components, the limit having a certain plasticity. In this embodiment of the invention, the conductivity of the etectrochemically activatable solid substance (B) may clearly not be as high as that of an electrochemically activatable solid substance (B) that constitutes the sole electrochemically relevant component of the mixture. In this variant, quaternary lithium ion conductors, such as Li4SiO4 o Li3PO4, Li4SiO4 o Li2SO4, or Li4SiO4  Li5AIO4, can be used for component (B) that combine ionic conductivity on the order of magnitude of 10"6 S/cm with high stability. The plasticity of the grain limits can be caused to increase if, in addition, a substance with high vapor pressure (for example ether or dimethoxethane for plasticizer and dibutyl phthafate) is worked into the paste-like mass. In this case the solvent acts as a modifying agent for the plasticizer. Such an embodiment is possible, for example, if the matrix contains or essentially comprises PVC or PVDF or other halogenated hydrocarbon<br>
-17-<br><br>
polymers.<br>
tt is possible to use a hygroscopic salt if the conductor (C) is an ion conductor. In this embodiment of the invention, the ion conductor (C) is worked into the paste-like mass in an anhydrous or lower water form. Water is absorbed during processing (or by subsequent storage in a humid environment). This results in a grain limit for this ion conductor that has a certain plasticity. If the hygroscopic ion conductor is able to form crystalline hydrates, the deposit of the diffusing water as crystallized water in a fixed grain size can causes an expansion in volume that creates improved grain limit contact, and the weaker bond of the conducting ion to the surrounding hydrate envelope also improves the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte (the cation of the electrolytes can move in its polar envelope to a certain degree). An example of a salt that can be used in this manner is LiNOs.<br>
if a salt that is insensitive to hydrolysis is used for conductor (C), for example a lithium salt selected from among perchlorate, the halogenides (X = Cl, Br, I), nitrate, sulfate, borate, carbonate, hydroxide, or tetrafluoroborate, especially for producing a solid electrolyte, the inventive paste-like mass and the electrochemicatly activatable layer to be produced therefrom can be produced in an advantageous manner in an ambient atmosphere.<br>
The components described in the foregoing from which the<br>
-18-<br><br>
inventive paste-like mass is produced can be mixed in a conventional manner, preferably by vigorously agitating or kneading the components. If necessary the organic polymer or its precursors are pre-dissolved or pre-swolIen in the solvent or swelling agent before the component (B) is added. In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the mass is subjected to ultrasonic treatment during the mixing process or thereafter. This causes the solid substance (B) and the conductor (C), if any, to pack more densely because the grains break up and thus decrease in size. This improves the electrical and electrochemical properties of the paste-like mass. The materials provided for the electrodes or electrolytes can also be subjected to such an ultrasonic treatment prior to being worked into the mass in order to reduce tine size of the grains at the beginning of the process.<br>
Embedding the solid substances (B) in the matrix (A) means that the powder of the efectrochemicaliy activatable substances does not have to be sintered at high temperatures, as is customary for "conventional" electrochemical elements. Such sintering would not result in the initial substances having a paste-like consistency.<br>
The inventive paste-like masses are especially suitable for producing thin-film batteries and other similar electrochemical elements such as electrochromic elements. Preferably these are elements in so-called "thick-film* technology.  The individual layers of these elements<br>
-10-<br><br>
are also called "tapes". Individual electrochemically active or activatable layers are produced in thicknesses from approximately 10 urn to approximately 1 to 2 mm, placed upon one another, and brought into intimate contact. One skilled in the art will select the thickness appropriate for the application.<br>
Ranges are preferably from approximately 50 urn to 500 urn; especially preferred is a range of approximately 100 urn. However, in accordance with the invention it is also possible to produce corresponding thin-film elements (this term includes thicknesses of preferably 100 nm to a few urn). However, this application may be limited because corresponding elements will not satisfy current requirements in terms of capacity in a number of cases. However, it is conceivable that the application could be used for back-up chips, for instance.<br>
The present invention therefore furthermore includes layers that can be produced from the paste-like masses described in the foregoing that are self-supporting or that are placed on a substrate, preferably in the thicknesses indicated. The layers are preferably flexible.<br>
For producing both the self-supporting layers (films, tapes) [and] layers that can be placed on a substrate, methods known in prior art can be used that can be used for the appropriate polymer materials of the matrix.   The consolidation of the paste-like masses then occurs,<br>
-20-<br><br>
depending on the material, by curing (of resins or other precondensates), by cross-linking prepolymerisates or linear polymerisates, by evaporating solvents, or in a similar manner In order to obtain self-supporting films, a suitable paste-like mass can be formed in the appropriate thickness on calenders, for examples. Standard technology can be used for this. Self-supporting layers can also be formed by applying the paste-like mass to a substrate and removing the layer produced after it has consolidated. The requirement for this is that the product has sufficient flexibility. The coating process can be performed using conventional paste application methods. For instance, application can be performed by brush, rake, spraying, spin coating, etc. Pressure techniques can also be used.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, cross-linkable resin masses (pre-condensates) are used as described above for the paste-like masses, and are cured by UV or electron radiation once the layer has been formed. Curing can naturally also be thermal or chemical (for example by immersing the produced layer in an appropriate bath). If necessary, suitable initiators or accelerators or the like are added to the masses for the cross-linking.<br>
The present invention furthermore relates to composite layers with electrochemical properties, especially accumulators and other batteries or electrochromic elements that are formed by or include a<br>
-21-<br><br>
corresponding sequence of the aforesaid layers.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates the sequence of such an arrangement. The labels are: contact electrode 1, intermediate tape 2, electrode 3, electrolyte 4, electrode 5, intermediate tape 6, and contact electrode 7. The following text provides a more detailed explanation.<br>
For producing composite layers, the individual paste-like masses can be applied ply by ply upon one another by means of paste application methods. Either each individual ply can be cross-linked by itself or it can be released by solvent or made into layer form in some other manner. However, it is also possible to consolidate the individual matrices by cross-linking or evaporating the solvent or swelling agent or the like once all of the required layers have been applied. This latter is advantageous, for instance, if the individual electrochemically activatable layers are applied using a pressure method that occurs analogous to polychromy. An example of this is the Flexodruck technique, by means of which multiple meters/second of a substrate can be printed continuously with the required electrochemically activatable layers.<br>
Alternatively, every layer or film can be converted individually into its final consolidated state. If these are self-supporting films, the appropriate components of the element to be formed can then be joined together by lamination.    Conventional laminating techniques can be<br>
-22-<br><br>
used for this. These include, for example, extrusion coating, whereby the second layer is bonded to a carrier layer by pressure rollers, calender coating with two or three roll nips, wherein the substrate web runs in in addition to the paste-like mass, or doubling (bonding under pressure and counterpressure of preferably heated rollers). One skilled in the art will not have any problem finding the techniques that are appropriate depending on the selection of the matrices for the paste-like masses.<br>
A pressure process during the bonding (lamination) of the individual layers can frequently be desirable, not only for improved bonding (and therefore for achieving improved conductivity) in the individual layers, but also, for instance, in order to eliminate any cavities that are present in the individual layers that were produced, for instance, when the plasticizer is washed out, etc., as described in the foregoing. Current techniques can be used for this. Cold pressing (at temperatures below 60 °C) can be advantageous if the materials used permit this. This provides particularly good contact among the individual layers.<br>
The electrochemical parts that can be produced with the inventive paste-like masses are not limited. It is therefore understood that the embodiments described in the following are merely examples and preferred embodiments.<br>
-23-<br><br>
Re-chargeable electrochemical cells can be produced in thick-layer technology in this manner, i.e., with individual electrochemically activatable layers in a thickness of approximately 10 urn to approximately 1 to 2 mm and preferably approximately 100 um. if the electrochemical cell is to be based on lithium technology, the solid substances for the electrodes or electrolyte layers can be those substances that have already been enumerated in the foregoing for this purpose. At least three layers should be provided, namely, one that functions as a positive electrode, one that functions as a solid body electrolyte, and one that functions as the negative electrode, i.e., layers 3, 4, and 5 in Figure 1.<br>
In accordance with the invention it has been demonstrated that particularly advantageous current densities can be obtained in the accumulator if certain limits are observed. As is known, current density can be adjusted by the resistance of the electrolyte. If it is too high, polarization can destroy the electrodes over the long term. If it is too low, the power of the produced accumulator is only sufficient for a few applications. The aforesaid limit is preferably 1 mA/cm2. For instance, if the conductivity of an electrolyte is 10~* S/cm, it is particularly advantageous for the electrolyte layer to be approximately 100 um thick. A current density of 1 mA/cm2 then causes a drop in voltage, caused by the resistance, that is a negligible 0.1 V.  In contrast, if the<br>
-24-<br><br>
conductivity of the electrolytes is 10-5 S/cm, for instance, the thickness of the electrolyte layer can be reduced to about 10 urn. it is therefore recommended that the layer thickness d be selected relative to conductivity oion and an ionic resistance (Q) and relative to the surface A such that the following formula is satisfied:<br>
200n<d></d>
The    aforesaid    three-layer   cell    (or   any   other   desired<br>
electrochemical	element,	comprising	positive<br>
electrode/electrolyte/negative electrode) can additionally be provided with reference (layers 1 and 7 in Figure 1). It is useful that these comprise films of suitable materials (materials for reference electrodes that can be used in lithium technology are described earlier in this specification).<br>
In a special embodiment of the invention, worked in between the lower reference electrode and the adjacent electrode and between the upper reference electrode and the adjacent electrode is an additional thin plastic layer ("intermediate tape", layers 2 and 6 in Figure 1) that can also be produced using a paste-tike mass of the present invention. This thin plastic layer should contain conducting metal elements or alloys of such efements that are suitable for transporting electrons from the electrode material to the reference electrode. Examples of this are the elements gold, platinum, rhodium, and carbon, or alloys of these<br>
-25-<br><br>
elements, if the plastic layer is to be arranged between the positive electrode and the associated reference electrode. If it is to be arranged between the negative electrode and the reference electrode, the elements that are appropriate are nickel, iron, chromium, titanium, molybdenum, tungsten, vanadium, manganese, niobium, tantalum, cobalt, and carbon. The information provided in the foregoing about the electrodes and electrolytes also applies, of course, to the concentration and structure of the paste-like masses from which these layers are formed. An embodiment with reference electrodes and intermediate tapes (see also Figure 1) has charge and discharge curves as illustrated in Figure 3 if it is produced, for example using the aforesaid lithium technology.<br>
The electrochemical elements of the present invention can be sealed, for example in a plastic-based housing. The weight in this case is advantageously less than that of metal housings. There are also advantages in terms of energy density.<br>
The electrochemical composite layer (the electrochemical element) can also be embedded between two or more films made of a plastic coated with wax or paraffin. These materials act as a seal and, due to their inherent properties, can also exert mechanical pressure on the composite layer, thereby advantageously achieving improved contact in the composite layer due to the pressure.<br>
-26-<br><br>
While the electrochemical element is sealed as described in the foregoing or in some other manner, the interior can be subjected to a pre-determined water/oxygen partial pressure that effects high electrochemical stability. This can be done, for instance, by sealing the electrochemical element in such an environment with parameters that have been selected and adjusted appropriately.<br>
If, as can be the case with many embodiments, moisture penetrates into the composite film during the course of the production process, which can have long-term undesirable consequences, the composite can be inserted in a housing or the like under a vacuum prior to sealing and, if necessary, can be subjected to an elevated temperature in order to extract the moisture.<br>
In a special embodiment of the invention, a three-layer system as described in the foregoing is selected for a rechargeable accumulator, whereby the layers receive an additive that decomposes during charging. The decomposition products form new connections at the limit surfaces with the electrochemically activatable components (B) or (C) that are present there, whereby a five-fayer system actually occurs if these decomposition products are ion conductors. One example of this is the addition of ether, which forms lithium organyls at the limit surfaces of an accumulator using lithium technology. In addition, polymer components of the matrix, plasticizer, viscosity agent,<br>
-27-<br><br>
and/or residual water that has penetrated during processing can be thus decomposed or partially decomposed in appropriate embodiments.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, a layer is selected for the electrolyte layer that comprises two films of differing composition that are laminated to one another, each of which have been adapted to the electrode with which it is in contact. This has a positive effect on the stability of the phase limits between positive electrode and electrolyte 1 and between negative electrode and electrolyte 2. A concrete example of this embodiment is using lithium iodide for the electrolyte material in the first layer and Li1.3AI0.3Ti17(PO4)3 for the electrolyte material in the second layer.<br>
An example of a galvanic cell with electrochromic properties would be a series of layers comprising the following sequence: Conductor 1/Y/MeX-alcoholate/WCVConductor 2<br>
In this sequence the metal Me can be selected from among, for example, lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, or cesium, and its anion X from among, for example, the halogenides chloride, bromide, and iodide. Conductor 1 can be selected from, for example, indium tin oxide (ITO), zinc aluminum oxide (ZnxAlyOz) and silver. Conductor 2 can be selected from among, for example, indium tin oxide (ITO) and zinc aluminum oxide (ZnxAlyOz).<br>
The inventive series of layers for the electrochemical elements<br>
-28-<br><br>
can be arranged in any desired shape. For instance, the flexible composite layer can be rolled up, which achieves particularly advantageous geometry for compact accumulators. If the accumulator has a small volume, this provides a very large active battery surface. Figure 2 illustrates such an embodiment, whereby reference numbers 1 through 7 indicate the same items as in Figure 1 and reference number 8 indicates an insulating layer.<br>
Non-self-supporting composite layers can also be applied to solid bases like wails for integrated energy storage (self-supporting composite films can of course also be applied or affixed thereto). In this case it is possible to take advantage of large surface areas. The accumulators themselves are not associated with a space requirement. A special example of an embodiment of this type is the integration of composite layers for accumulators in substrates for solar cells. Independent energy supply units can be created in this manner. Layer sequences for accumulators can also be applied to solid or flexible substrates in order to work in electronic structures of the integrated energy storage.<br>
