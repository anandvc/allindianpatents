BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of mesylate (methane sulfonate )salt of imatinib base .Mesylate(methane sulfonate ) salt of imatinib base [(4-(4-methylpiperazin-1 -ylmethyl)-N-4-[methyl-3-(4-pyridin-3-yl) pyrimidin-2-yl amino) phenyl]benzamide] is a protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor and has the formula (la).<br><br><br>
This drug is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) in chronic phase (or) in accelerated phase (or) blast crisis after failure of interferon-alpha therapy. It has also been approved by the FDA to treat Gastro Intestinal Stomal Tumours (GIST)<br>
The preparation of [(4-(4-methylpiperazin-l-ylmethyl)-N-4-[methyl-3-(4-pyridin-3-yl) pyrimidin-2-yl amino)phenyl]ben2amide (Imatinib) of formula (la) and the use thereof especially as an antitumour agent is   described in EP patent No. 0564 409, (Ger.,<br>
th<br>
Assignee : Ciba-Geigy corp.) which was published on 6   Octoberl993 and in US patent no 55211584 (Assignee : Ciba-Geigy corp; Title : Pyrimidine derivatives and process for the preparation there of ) which was published on 28'*^ May 1996 and in equivalent applications in other countries. [ AU-3569493A (1993); CA-2093203A (1993) etc.]<br><br>
In EP Patent No.   0564409 and in its equivalent US patent no 55211584 the following route is described.<br><br><br>
Step-1 : 2-amino-4-nitro toluene of the formula (III) in absolute ethanol is treated with 65% nitric acid to form the nitrate salt followed by condensation with cyanamide solution at reflux temperature for 25 hours. After cooling to 0°C, filtration and washing with 1:1 ethanol : diethylether yielded 2-methyl-5-nitrophenyl guanidine nitrate of the formula (IV).<br>
Step-2 : 2-methyl-5-nitrophenyl guanidine of the formula (IV) obtained in step 1 is taken in isopropanol and treated with 3-dimethylaminO"l-(3-pyridyl)-2-propen-l-one of the formula (V) and sodium hydroxide and refluxed for 12 hours. After cooling to 0°C, filtration and washing with isopropanol and methanol yielded N-(2-methyl-5-nitrophenyl)-4-(3-pyridyl)-2-pyrimidine amine of the formula (VI)<br>
Step-3 : A suspension of N-(2-methyl-5-nitro henyl)-4-(3-pyridyl)-2-pyrimidine amine of the formula (VI) obtained in step 2 is taken in ethyl acetate and hydrogenated with 10% Pd"C at normal pressure. The resulting suspension is filtered and the filtrate is concentrated under vacuum to yield a crude product which is recrystallized from methylene chloride to yield N-(5-amino-2-methylphenyl)-4-(3-pyridyl)-2-pyrimidine amine of the formula (VII).<br>
Step-4 : A solution of N-(5-amino-2-methylphenyl)-4-(3-pyridyl)-2-pyrimidine amine of the formula (VII) obtained in step 3 and 4-(4-methyl-piperazinomethyl)benzoyl chloride of the formula (VIII) taken in pyridine are stirred under nitrogen at room temperature for 23 hours. The resulting reaction mixture is concentrated under high vacuum; water is added and the mixture is filtered. After drying at 80°C under high vacuum, the crude product is made into slurry with methylene chloride &amp; methanol and filtered to yield Imatinib of the formula (la). After separation by chromatography, fiirther amounts of the product was obtained.<br>
When we carried out the above process  in our laboratory as per the details provided in the above said patent we observed the following difficulties in carrying out the process.. 1.   In step 1<br><br>
(i) The yield of compound of formula (IV) is very low (20-25%)<br>
(ii)  Process for the recovery of the starting material of the  formula (III) is not given.<br>
Without recovery and reuse of compound of the formula (III), the effective yield of<br>
compound of formula (IV) will be less<br>
(iii)The Reaction time is very lengthy that is 25 hours,   which could be problematic for<br>
commercial scale production<br>
(iv)Use of diethylether is not possible on commercial scale production because it is<br>
highly flammable and very volatile<br>
2.	In step (2)<br>
The yield   of compound of formula (VI) is low (50%) making the process non economical<br>
3.	In step (3)<br>
Required  product of formula-(VII) is not formed.    High melting compound  (170-180°C) with different infrared spectrum is obtained<br>
4.	In step (4)<br>
i)   Yield of compound of formula (la) employing the intermediate of formula (VIII) is<br>
very low (10-20%) thereby making the process uneconomical for commercial<br>
production ii)   Column chromatography is necessary to isolate   product of formula (la)   in pure<br>
form and Column chromatography technique becomes unpractical  on commercial<br>
scale, iii)   Usage of the obnoxious and foul smelling chemical pyridine as a solvent  and its<br>
distillation for work-up makes this process to be abandoned on bulk scale, iv)   Preparation of formula (VIII) is not disclosed. However   it can be prepared by<br>
literature methods in five steps as given in scheme 2 v)   Preparation of compoimd of formula (VIII) adds five more steps to the process<br>
making the overall synthesis lengthy comprising of nine steps.<br><br>
The known intermediate of formula (VIII) is prepared by conventional methods and is outlined below<br><br>
Step-1; P-Toluic acid of   the formula (IX) on esterification with methanol yields compound of the formula (X)<br><br>
Step-2: Compound of the formula (X) on bromination with N-bromo succinimide yields compound of the formula (XI)<br>
Step-3: Compound of the formula(XI) on reaction with N-methyl piperazine yields compound of the formula (XII)<br>
Step-4: Compound of the formula (XII) on hydrolysis with aqueous potassium hydroxide yields compound of the formula (XIII)<br>
Step-5: Compound of the formula (XIII) on chlorination with thionyl chloride yields compound of the formula (VIII)<br>
