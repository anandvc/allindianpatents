				<td>The present invention relates to an absorbent article and a method for the targeted transfer of locally discharged fluids.<br>
Absorbent articles have been known for a long time as sanitai'y articles. They are used, for example, as diapers, incontinence pad's or sanitary napkins. Such absorbent articles are so desligned that they are capable of absorbing and retaining liquid body exudates, such as urine, menstrual fluid or blood. Sanitary napkins are, for example, used to absorb fluids discharged before, during and after menstruation. Sanitary napkins are worn on the outside of the body (externally) and thus differ in so far from tampons which are inserted into the female vagina and can thus be referred to as "internal" products.<br>
The use of known absorbent articles is frequently felt as disadvantageous in so far as the bodyside surface, after liquids having been discharged thereon, comprises wet areas which causes discomfort to the wearer. Tests conducted in this field showed that conventional sanitary napkins rewet already if only about 5% of the theoretical liquid absorption capacity of the sanitary napkin has been utilized. Moreover, the discharged body fluids often leave visible residues on the surface of the absorbent article which causes the user of the . article to change the absorbent article more often than it would be necessary as far as the absorbency for liquids is concerned.<br>
Accordingly it is an object of the present invention to provide an absorbent article and a method for the targeted transfer of locally discharged liquids, wherein the absorbency of the liquid storage material of the absorbent article is optimally<br><br><br>
utilized and as little traces of use as possible are visible on the bodyside surface of the absorbent article even after prolonged use thereof.<br>
This object is solved by the present invention by the absorbent article according to independent claim 1 and the method according to independent claim 34. Further advantageous embodiments of the absorbent article and the method of the Invention are evident from the dependent claims, the description and the drawings.<br>
The absorbent article of the invention comprises a front portion and a rearward portion which are interconnected by a central portion. The layer disposed toward the wearer's body when the absorbent article is in use is formed of a liquid-permeable material, whereas the layer of the article which is disposed away from the wearer's body is formed of a liquid-impermeable layer. Between the liquid-permeable layer disposed toward the wearer's body and the liquid-impermeable layer disposed away from the wearer's body, there is pi'ovided a layer which is capable of distributing the fluids penetrating into the absorbent article in a preferred direction in the absorbent article. This layer will be referred to in the following as liquid distribution layer. Furthermore, the absorbent article of the present invention comprises a layer in which the penetrated liquid is received and retained (the so-called liquid storage layer, also referred to as absorbent body). Finally, the absorbent article of the invention comprises means for transferring the fluid penetrated into the article from the liquid distribution layer into the liquid storage layer. Due to the specific structure of the absorbent article of the invention, it is achieved that a liquid which has penetrated into the article is preferably stored in the end portions of the article. Moreover, the liquid is stored more easily in the<br><br><br>
lower layers of the article, which results into a so-called 'bottom-up filling effect.<br>
Preferably, the liquid distribution layer is so provided that the liquid which has penetrated into the absorbent body is lead from the point of discharge in the central area to the front and rearward portions of the article. In case of an elongated absorbent article, a liquid distribution in longitudinal direction of the article is thus accomplished.<br>
The liquid distribution layer may extend over the entire width of the absorbent article and the liquid storages, respectively. If an efficient liquid transfer system is used in the absorbent article, it may, however, also suffice to provide the liquid digtribution layer of smaller width than the smallest width of the absorbent article and liquid storage layer, respectively.<br>
The liquid distribution or drainage to the front and rearward ends of the article is achieved in a particularly favorable manner in that the liquid distribution layer comprises a corrugated or pleated web, the corrugations of which are so arranged that the liquid is preferably conducted in longitudinal direction to the ends of the article. The corrugated or pleated web may, for example, consist of a nonwoven material which has practically no absorbing capacity of its own, which prevents liquid from being permanently retained by the web. The corrugated web serves primarily to conduct or drain liquid and as spacer. As the corrugated web furthermore includes pigment materials, the liquid-containing absorbent body is prevented from showing through, which increases the wearer's feeling of tidiness.<br>
Preferably the corrugated web is joined to a further web which<br>
is capable of contributing to the stability of the corrugation,<br>
on the one hand, and to ' a targeted transfer of the liquid<br><br><br>
penetrated into the article, on the other hand. A., so-called uncreped through air dried material (UCTAD material) was found to be particularly suitable for such a further web.<br>
A preferred UCTAD material includes at least 10 wt. % of high yield pulp fibers, based on the dry substance, to which a we,t strength agent is added in, an aiuount which causes the ratio of the wet tenacity to the dry tenacity to be at least about O.l. High yield pulp fibers contain a high amount of lignin which should be the reason for the wet elasticity of the fibers. The resin bonds formed by the wet strength agent immobilize the wet elastic fibers in a sheetlike structure which adapt to the structure of the belt on which throughdrying is effected. During the drying step the bonds formed by the wet strength agent are cured so that wet-resistant bonds are formed which in turn imparts the highly elastic properties to a corresponding web in a wet state. The web maintains this property because in an UCTAD process no creping step or other steps are performed which would destroy the bonds again. Accordingly, the UCT7VD material is highly suitable to transfer liquids because the material is stabilized also in a wet state.<br>
A further embodiment of the liquid distribution layer of the absorbent article of the invention is such that the corrugated web is pleated on a liquid-permeable carrier material extending over the entire width of the absorbent article, the corrugated web requiring only a part of the entire width of the carrier material. Beneath the corrugated web with carrier, there may be again provided the further web. The above-mentioned materials, namely spundbondend nonwoven and UCTAD, are suitable materials for the corrugated web and the further web, respectively. A spunbonded nonwoven is also suitable as material for the carrier.<br><br><br>
A further essential feature of the absorbent article of the invention are means for transferring a fluid from the liquid distribution layer at least to that part of the liquid storage layer which is disposed in the front portion and/or rearward portion of the absorbent article. These means may be, for example, portions of the liquid distribution layer which are-brought into close contact with the liquid storage layer by the application of pressure, for example, in a calendering process. It is advantageous for these portions which are contacted by pressure are to be in the form of points.<br>
The transfer of liquid from the liquid distribution layer to the liquid storage layer may be further promoted in that both above-mentioned layers are interconnected by means of an adhesive. A hydrophilic adhesive was found to be particularly suitable as adhesive. The joining of the liquid distribution layer and the liquid storage layer by means of the adhesive is preferably also effected in the form of points. Geometric patterns are also preferred, a rhombic pattern providing for a particularly efficient liquid transfer from the liquid distribution layer to the liquid storage layer.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment of the absorbent article of the invention, the means for transferring a fluid from the liquid distribution layer to the liquid storage layer are so designed that the liquid distribution layer comprises funnel-shaped openings which are oriented such that the funnel-shaped openings taper towards the liquid storage layer. The funnel-shaped openings ensure a targeted drainage of the liquid from the liquid distribution layer to the liquid storage layer. Furthermore, the funnel-shaped openings cause the liquid    distribution layer to remain spaced apart from the liquid storage layer, which effectively prevents a reflux of the  liquid from the liquid storage layer into the liquid distribution layer. The funnel-shaped openings are preferably<br><br><br>
provided in the further web which is connected to the pleated web.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the article of the invention, the further web comprises a central portion, seen in longitudinal direction,  without  funnel-shaped openings onto<br><br>
are provided in the edge portions, seen in longitudinal direction. The edge portions with the funnel-shaped openings are folded over beneath the section of the further web having the corrugated web applied thereon such that the tapered portions of the funnel-shaped openings face towards the liquid storage layer. By forming the funnel shaped openings in the further web, for example, by means of needles, the further web is pierced, which results into the formation of small suction feet at the tapered end of the funnel-shaped opening. A particularly effective fluid transfer is achieved if these suction feet are in engagement with the liquid storage layer, because this promotes the targeted transfer of the liquid from the liquid distribution layer into the liquid storage layer. The further web may be folded such that it is folded ovei' from each side to about the center of the further web. However, the edge portions may also have the same width as the portion of the further web on which the corrugated web is pleated. By folding the edge portions including funnel-shaped openings below the further web a three-layered structure is thus obtained. This three-layered structure prevents particularly effective a reflux of liquid from the liquid storage into the 'liquid distribution layer.<br>
A targeted liquid transfer from the liquid distribution layer    to the liquid storage layer, or the absorbent body, is also promoted in that the liquid storage layer is formed with areas of increased liquid retention capacity, with liquid being preferably transferred into these portions.  If  the  liquid<br><br><br>
storage layer is comprised of pulp, the increased retention capacity can be achieved by densifying the pulp material. The densification results into a reduction of pores and pore size, respectively, in the pulp material which increases the capillary forces. A further possibility to provide locally restricted areas of increased liquid retention capacity in the absorbent body is the use of superabsorbent materials in these locally restricted areas.<br>
If, as in the present case, it is desired to optimally utilize the absorbent body for the storage of liquid, it is advantageous for the end portions of the absorbent articles to be the first to store the liquid and a liquid storage in the central part of the article is effected later aftei- the absorbent capacity of the end portions is exhausted. This results into an optimal utilization of the absorbent body's capacity and the wearer of the absorbent article need not change the article quite as often.<br>
This targeted filling of the absorbent with liquid can<br>
furthermore be promoted in that the further web includes no<br>
funnel-shaped openings in the central portion the absorbent<br>
article and the funnel-shaped openings are only provided in the<br>
front and/or rearward portion of the absorbent article. This<br>
prevents fluid discharged onto the absorbent article in the<br>
central portion thereof and penetrating therein from being<br>
directly deposited in the portion of the liquid storage layer<br>
disposed directly below the area of fluid insult. This is less<br>
desirable, because the absorbent capacity of the absorbent<br>
article could not be fully exhausted before rewetting of the<br>
bodyside surface of the article occurs.	<br>
The danger of rewetting can furthermore be minimized in that a liquid-impermeable barrier layer is disposed between the lateral  edge  of  the  absorbent  article  and  the  liquid<br><br><br>
distribution layer. This is in particular recommended if the width b of the liquid distribution layer is smaller than the smallest width B of the liquid storage layer. This barrier layer causes liquid penetratinr- out from the liquid storage layer cannot pass past the liquid distribution layer to the surface of the absorbent article, which further increases the wear comfort of the absorbent article.<br>
Moreover, the absorbent article of the invention may include a liquid-absorbing layer between the liquid-permeable layer and the liquid distribution layer.  not primarily serve as primary storage or secondary storage. The purpose of this liquid-absorbing layer much rather resides in that liquid which has escaped again from the liquid storage layer or which could not penetrate into the liquid storage from the outset is collected before it penetrates to the surface of the absorbent article. The function of the liquid-absorbing layer is thus to be seen as a storage means which, in case the liquid storage layer is overtaxed, is capable of taking up and storing liquids before the latter cause rewetting of the surface of the absorbent article. In order for the penetration of the liquids into the absorbent body and the distribution of the liquid by means of the liquid distribution layer to be not unnecessarily impeded, it is preferred for the liquid-absorbing layer to include a centrally disposed opening which extends through the entire layer. This opening should be provided such that, when the absorbent article is worn, it faces towards the body opening from which the liquid to be absorbed is discharged. The liquid-absorbing layer may be composed of pulp material or include such pulp material. A pulp material layer is soft and thus increases the wear comfort of an accordingly        structured absorbent article.<br>
A further suitable material 'for the liquid-absorbing layer is a pulp  mixture,  such  as,  for  example,  a  so-called  coform<br><br><br>
material. A coform material consists of pulp and polypropylene fibers at most different mixing ratios. The polypropylene fibers are extruded. The liquid-absorbing layer and the liquid storage layer may consist of the same material.<br>
The liquid-impermeable barrier layer and the liquid-impermeable cover layer of the absorbent article of the invention may be made of polyethylene, polypropylene or mixtures of these polymers. In order to ensure a close fit of the absorbent article and in order to prevent same to move out of place while the article is worn, the outside of the liquid-impermeable cover layer may be provided with an adhesive layer with which the absorbent article can be secured in a garment.<br>
The targeted liquid transfer in the absorbent article of the invention may further be improved by additional means, for example, additional webs providing for a preferred transfer direction. It is favorable for such additional mpans to be disposed between the liquid distribution layer and the liquid storage layer.<br>
The liquid-permeable cover layer and the liquid-absorbing layer<br>
can easily be joined with each other, for example, by punctual<br>
pressing.	<br>
The absorbent article of the invention is particularly suitable for use as sanitary napkin or sanitary panty liner.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention provides a method for the targeted transfer of locally discharged liquids, said liquid being discharged onto an absorbent article and penetrating<br>
through a liquid-permeable cover layer into the  absorbent<br>
article. The penetrated liquid is then transferred by means of a liquid distribution layer into those portions of the absorbent article in which liquid storage is desired.  The<br><br>
transfer of the liquid from the liquid distribution layer to the liquid storage layer is caused by means which enable a targeted transfer of the liquid. It is particularly preferred to use an absorbent article of the invention for the implementation of the method of the invention.<br><br>

Fig. 11 is a perspective view of a further embodiment of an absorbent article of the invention.<br>
Fig. 1 shows an absorbent article 10 comprising a front portion 12 and a rearward portion 14 as well as a central portion 16 connecting the front portion and the rearward portion'. Reference number 18 designates the upper liquid-permeable cover layer of highly pigmented spunbonded nonwoven, and reference number 20 designates the lower liquid-impermeable layer of the absorbent article. The liquid distribution layer 22 is disposed beneath the liquid-permeable layer 18. The targeted transfer of liquids into the end portions of the absorbent article 10 is effected in the embodiment of Fig. 1 by means of the corrugated web 26. The corrugated web 26 is pleated on a further web 28. The corrugated web 26 is made of a nonwoven material (pigmented spunbonded nonwoven) and the further web 2 8 is made of an UCTAD material. The edge portions of the further web 28 are folded over downwardly so that the folded portions extend in parallel to the corrugated web. Funnel-shaped openings 3 0 are provided in the folded-over portions of the further web 28 . The liquid storage layer 24 is positioned beneath the further web 28.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment of the absorbent article of the invention, the absorbent article may comprise a liquid-absorbing layer 32. This liquid-absorbing layer 32 is<br><br><br>
i<br>
provided to collect fluid taken up in the liquid storage layer 24 and escaping therefrom again and laterally passing past the liquid distribution layer 22 before it may penetrate out on the surface of the absorbent article through the liquid-permeable layer 18. It is particularly favorable for the liquid-absorbing layer 32 to have a centrally disposed through opening 34. When the absorbent article is in use, the central opening 34 is disposed opposite to the wearer's body opening from which the fluid to be absorbed is discharged. Due to opening 34, the fluid to be absorbed need not pass through an absorbent article before it reaches the liquid distribution layer 22 which contributes to the desired distribution of the fluid in longitudinal direction of the absorbent body. The liquid-permeable web 18 and the corrugated web 26 are made of a nonwoven fabric which contains pigments. As a result, liquid retained in the liquid storage layer 24 cannot show through to the  surface  of  the  absorbent  article.  This  improves  the<br><br>
after a liquid has been applied to the absorbent article it is hardly perceptible from the outside that this article may have already taken up larger amounts of liquid.<br>
Fig. 2 is a functional longitudinal section through the absorbent article along line 2 of Fig. 1. Here, the arrows illustrate the flow of liquid within the absorbent article. The liquid passing through the liquid-permeable layer 18 impinges on the liquid distribution layer 22. The liquid distribution layer 22 prevents the liquid from passing directly to the liquid storage layer 24. Rather, a targeted transfer in the direction of the front portion 12 and the rearward portion 14, respectively, of the absorbent article is effected. The liquid  transfer from the liquid distribution layer 22 to the liquid storage layer 24 preferably takes place in regions 24a of the liquid storage layer 24 which have an increased liquid retention capacity. The storage layer 24 is made of pulp. The<br><br><br>
increased liquid retention capacity of the regions 24a is accomplished in that the pulp material is densified, which is illustrated by the denser hatching in Fig. 2. The funnel-shaped openings 30 formed in the layer 22 are also shown, said funnel-shaped openings causing a vertical transfer of the liquid from the top to the bottom, the structure of the funnel-shaped openings being such that practically no reflux of liquid from regions further below to regions further above can take place. Equally, Fig. 2 shows the liquid-absorbing layer 32 which is capable of receiving liquids not absorbed by the liquid storage 24 or escaping therefrom again before the liquid might penetrate again through the liquid-permeable layer 18 to the surface  of the absorbent article.<br>
Fig. 3A is an enlarged section of the contact area between the liquid distribution layer 22 and the liquid storage layer 24 The arrows in Fig. 3 irldicate again the preferred liquid transfer direction. Fig. 3 shows the further web 28 having a three-layered structure. The top layer 28a on which the corrugated web is applied is provided without funnel-shaped openings. The layers 28b and 28c therebelow, however, are provided with funnel-shaped openings 30. Due to the configuration of the funnel-shaped openings 30, layers 28b and  28c may be spaced apart from one another, as is shown in Fig. 3A, which impedes an upward reflux of liquid. Between layer- 28c and the further web of the liquid-storing layer 24, there may be provided a space 44 through the funnel-shaped openings 3 0 (Fig. 3B) , which likewise contributes to prevent liquid from returning from the liquid-storing layer 24 to the liquid distribution layer 28.<br>
Figs. 3A and 3B likewise show the little suction feet 40 at the outlet of the funnel openings 30. Each of these little suction feet 40 engage into the web below and thus contribute to a targeted liquid transfer towards the liquid storage layer 24.<br><br><br>
Fig. 4 is a cross-section through the absorbent article along line 4-4 of Fig. 1. The arrow indicates the direction of the liquid discharge into the absorbent article. The discharged liquid is then transferred along the corrugated web 26 extending to the ends of the absorbent article. Fig. 4 also shows the further web 28 in cross-section. That part of the web 28 which supports the corrugated web 26 includes no openings. The lateral parts therebeneath are each in fluid contact with the layer disposed below through openings 30. Furthermore, the funnel-shaped openings 30 in the lowermost part of layer 28 extend down into the liquid storage layer 24.<br>
Fig. 5 shows an enlarged section ot  the corrugated web 26 in cross-section. The corrugated web 26 is joined with the further web 28 via contact points. Layer 28 consists of the three sheets 28a, 28b and 28c. Sheet 28a supporting the corrugated web 26 has no openings 30. The two layers 28b and 28c positioned therebelow, however, include the funnel-shaped openings 30 which promote a vertically directed flow of the penetrated liquid. This downwardly directed vertical flow results into a channel structure which prevents an upward reflux of liquid. An upward transfer of liquid through layer 28 does practically not take place any more.<br>
Fig. 6 shows a functional longitudinal section through a further embodiment of the absorbent article of the invention. The special feature of the embodiment of Fig. 6 resides in that the further web 2 8 has no funnel-shaped openings 3 0 in the central area of the absorbent article. This results into an even more efficient liquid transfer into the longitudinal end portions of the web 28 before the liquid is transferred into the liquid storage layer 24 and 24a, respectively.<br><br><br>
Fig. 7 shows the further web 28. Seen in longitudinal direction, it comprises a central zone 29a which has no funnel-shaped openings. Sections 29b and 29c disposed at the side edges of the further web 28 include portions 30a with openings as well as a portion 30b without openings. When the further web 28 is used in the absorbent article 10, the web 28 is folded over inwardly along lines 27, which results in the structure shown in Fig. 8. The folded structure of web 28 now includes selectively openings 30 in its end portions, seen in longitudinal direction, while the central portion is completely free of openings. This construction of the further web 28 causes the targeted flow of liquid, described above in further detail, which has penetrated into the absorbent article into the front portion and the rearward portion of the absorbent article. It is not until the liquid storage layer in the front end portion and the rearward end portion of the absorbent article have sucked themselves full with liquid that the central portion of the liquid storage layer 24 is filled with liquid.<br>
Fig. 9 shows another embodiment of the further web 28. Likewise seen in longitudinal direction, it comprises a central zone 29d with no funnel-shaped openings. Sections 28c on the edges, however, are continuously provided with openings 30. Before the further web can be used in the absorbent article of the invention, it is folded along lines 27a, which results into the structure shown in Figure 10. The pleated web can be applied to section 29d and the web 28 can be incorporated into the absorbent article, with the funnel-shaped openings 30 facing downwards.<br>
Finally, Fig. 11 shows a further preferred embodiment of the<br>
absorbent article of the invention. The embodiment lOA of Fig.<br>
11 comprises as further reflux barrier the liquid barrier layer<br>
38 which is essentially liquid-impermeable or semi-permeable.<br><br><br>
The barrier layer prevents liquid penetrating out from the liquid storage layer 24 into the liquid-absorbing layer 32 and from there possibly through the liquid-permeable layer 28 on the surface of the absorbe:nt art ' cle from escaping. The barrie'r layer 38 extends from the 'edge 16 to the liquid distribution layer 22. The layer 38 may be formed integrally with or as prolongation of the liquid-impermeable layer 2 0 and thus be made of the same material as the layer 20. A further suitable<br><br>
results into a semi-permeable membrane. The latter may be sandwiched between the liquid-permeable layer 18 and the liquid-impermeable layer 20. The incorporation of an impermeable or semi-permeable barrier layer is favorable whenever the width b of the liquid distribution layer is smaller than the smallest width B of the liquid storage layer 24 (see Fig. 1) .<br>
Furthermore, the absorbent article lOA shown in Fig. 11 includes an additional web 42 which further contributes to the liquid distribution in the absorbent article in longitudinal direction. Layer 42 is just as layer 28 made of an UCTAD material. The web 42 includes grooves 46 which extend in longitudinal direction and contribute to a liquid transfer in the desired longitudinal direction. Furthermore, the layer 42 also has funnel-shaped openings 48 through which the liquid can pass into the liquid storage 24.<br><br><br><br>
