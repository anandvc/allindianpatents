				<td>FIELD OE INVENTION<br>
This   invention  relates  to  a  method   of depositing  thin film  of non metals such  as<br>
diamond like carbon on substrates.<br>
BACKGROUND oF INVENTION<br>
It.  is known that diamond like  carbon  -films are niet.aet.abJ. e  aniporphoua material si- which may  include s micro crystalline phase.  Such &amp; material has  several distinct  advantages  in  that  it  possesses   extreme hardness  in  the  range  o-f  1000—3000  kg/mn2 with  a generally low -friction coefficient between 0.01 to 0.28. Further.  diamond  like carbon films have  high  optical transparency and high electricalrestivity.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
It is known to deposit thin films o-f	diamond<br>
like   carbon   by  the  mesthcid  of  chemical vapour<br>
deposition.  In one such known method employing	hot wire<br>
chemical vapour deposition, the disadvantage is	that  of<br>
high  substrate  temperaturess  such  as  106K	and  low<br>
deposition   rates.    Such  &amp;   process   has	limited<br>
applications.<br><br>
Yet another method known in the art. consists in an electron assisted chemical vapour de-position. Such a method is al&amp;o attended with the di sadvantaae at a hi ah substrate temperature of 106K during deposition. and further it is difficult to control the growth rate. Yet. another disi-idvantacie is the low quality of -films. and consequentially it had limited applications.<br>
A plasma assisted chemical vapour deposition method is also known in the art, and which could either be microwave or remote plasma assisted chemical vapour deposition. In the microwave chemical vapour deposition. the substrate is normally Si and which requires to be scratched by SiC. A disadvantage is that of high substrate temperatures in the vicinity of 900°C and low deposition rates. Vet another disadvantage is that its rough surface topoqraphv limits its aptical and electronic. application. In the remote- plasma asisi sited chemical vapour deposition,, the substrates are normally Si and Ni. The di sadvantacie.s are of high substrate temperature, low deposition rate and rough surface topography.<br>
A physical vapour deposition method is known in the art. and employing ion beam sputtering with a<br><br>
current, density of source of IMA/Cm2 at 1000 e V. A disadvantage of such a method is that of low cits-position rates and also requires extremely .low pressures. and which adds- to the coats.<br>
It is also known in the- art to employ a dual ion sputtering beam, and wherein the substrate can be Si. and variety of metals. A disadvantage of such a method is that the deposition rate laser depends an pressure.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided a method of depositing thin film of non metals that is diamond like carbon on any substrate as herein described characterized by the step of forming dense plasma under an inert gas wherein inert gas is argon within the plasma chamber having a copper anode and a set of cathodes assembly a capacitor to provide voltage, focusing the dense plasma on non-metal pellet supported on<br><br>
anode, positioning a holder to hold any substrate away from the anode wherein the distance between the anode and the substrate depend on the quality and thickness of film.within the chamber, heating the substrate, focusing of the said dense plasma to allow discharge of the pellet ions to the substrate and to form a film thereon.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION WITH REFERENCE TO ACCOMPANYING DRAWING<br>
Reference is made to fig. 1 which illustrates an apparatus that can be employed for carrying out the process of the present invention. However, it is to be understood that the apparatus of fig. 1 is only exemplary in nature as any other apparatus may be employed.<br>
Reference to fig. 1, the device 1 that may as by way of example be employed in the process of the present invention comprises a focus chamber 2 made of mild steel or stainless steel and has an insulator sleeve 3 which assists in the formation of the plasma. A high voltage charger 4 is connected to a capacitor C1. which charges capacitor C1. A spark gap SG allows a discharge from capacitor C1 to an electrode assembly<br><br>
consistino of a centrally disposed anode made up of copper and -filed with graphite 5 and a set. of symmetrically disposed cathodes 7. A voltage of 12-17 KV is applied to capacitor C1 ,. Thus, when capacitor C1 discharges a plasma sheet is -formed between anode 5 and backwall plate 8 and connected to cathodes 7, The height o-f insulator sleeve 3 determines the shape o-f plasma sheet.<br>
The plasma is -formed in an atmosphere of an inert, etas, such as argon. The plasma temperature is 0.5 Key to 10 Kev. and pre-ferabl y between 1 Key to 5 Kev.<br>
      The  plasma  density  is  1022 m -3   to  1027   m -3  and preferablv 1024m-3 to 1027 m-3<br>
Due to the maanetic -field there is a -force which moves the plasma sheet away -from anode 5 and when it reaches cathodes 7. the radial component of current densitv and azimuthal magnetic, -field gives an axial force so that the plasma sheet moves at a high speed upwards.. and when it reaches the top o-f anode 5. there is an axial component o-f current density and azimuthal magnetic -field. but. as current. is in the opposite direction, it results in a collapsing of- plasma radially inward w2th such a compression, a high temperature and density plasma acts on the graphite 12 supported at the<br><br>
top of anode 5 and allows the release of ions in a conical shower towardss the substrate 5.0. artel with the shutter in a withdrawn position. in accordance with this invention, a heater is provided at the holding end of a brass- holder 11 for holdinq substrate10,<br>
The     ion   flux   used   in   the  process   is   1015to<br>
1020   ion/blast,   and   preferably   1010   to   1018     10ns/blast. the  ion   energy   is-   1   Kev   to   10  may.<br>
The device has a vacuun pump lo with a pressure  qande 14. Further. &amp; pas inlet 15 is- provided with device 1 far introduction of a gas. such as around.<br>
in operation, device 1 is first evacuated by vacuum pump .13. Arpan gas is then introduced through gas iniet 15.<br>
Holder 11 can be moved along the vertical axis sO a si to allow the; distance of aubatrate J.0 to be varied from anode 5. Dependina on the quality and thickness of film. substrate 1(3 is diapoaed at a distance of 1 to 10 cm from anode 5.<br>
In accordance! with this invention the substate 3. s heated to a temper ature of ambient to 500oc, and prefer abaly  100 to 3000C. the pellet has a thickness of 5 mm to i cm.<br><br><br>
