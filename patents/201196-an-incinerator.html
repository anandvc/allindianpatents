5<br>
an air blower 86 disposed downstream of the air outlet 213 and is mounted on said air conduit for introducing atmospheric air via the open bottom end 2 12 through the gap 101 and the air conduit and into the dryer 90 such that the introduced atmospheric air is heated in the gap 101 by virtue of heat flow from the peripheral wall 11 of the furnace 10 into the gap 101.<br>
The heat-insulating shield 20 is formed with a plurality of baffles 23, 24 interconnecting the peripheral wall 21 of the heat-insulating shield 20 and the peripheral wall 11 of the furnace 10 so as to form a tortuous channel 102 thereamong for passage of the hot air flowing in the gap 101.<br>
Referring to Figs. 2 to 4, the air conduit has first and second sections 81, 82. An air-flow controller 80 is disposed between the first and second sections 81, 82, and includes a control valve 83, a pinion-and-rack unit 84, and a driving unit 84 3 mounted on the air conduit. The first section 81 has one end connected to the air outlet 213, and an opposite end connected to the second section 82. The second section 82 has an enlarged end 821 which has an inner wall 822, which receives the opposite end of the first section 81, and which converges in a direction toward an opposite end of the second section<br>
82	opposite to the enlarged end 821. The control valve<br>
83	is disposed in the enlarged end 821 of the second<br><br>
