COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10)<br>
LAUNDRY TREATMENT COMPOSITIONS<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The  following   specification   particularly  describes  the   nature  of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br><br>
LAUNDRY TREATMENT COMPOSITIONS<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to compositions comprising a substituted polysaccharide of the kind comprising a benefit agent and a deposition aid for deposition of the benefit agent onto a substrate, and a silicone. These compositions^are suitable, for example, for use as laundry treatment compositions or as components thereof. It further relates to a method of depositing a silicone from solution or dispersion, onto a substrate by means of such a composition.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The deposition of a benefit agent onto a substrate, such as a fabric, is well known in the art. In laundry applications typical "benefit agents" include fabric softeners and conditioners, soil release polymers, sunscreens; and the like. Deposition of a benefit agent is used, for example, in fabric treatment processes such as fabric softening to impart desirable properties to the fabric substrate.<br>
Conventionally, the deposition of the benefit agent has had to rely upon the attractive forces between the oppositely charged substrate and the benefit agent. Typically this requires the addition of benefit agents during the rinsing step of a treatment process so as to avoid adverse effects from other charged chemical species present in the treatment compositions. For example, cationic fabric conditioners are incompatible with anionic surfactants in laundry washing compositions.<br>
Such adverse charge considerations can place severe limitations upon the inclusion of benefit agents in compositions where an active component thereof is of an opposite charge to that of the benefit agent. For example, cotton is negatively charged and thus requires a positively charged benefit agent in order for the benefit agent to be substantive to the cotton, i.e. to have an affinity for the cotton so as to absorb onto it.<br><br>
Often the substantivity of the benefit agent is reduced and/or the deposition rate of the<br>
material is reduced because of the presence of incompatible charged species in the<br>
compositions. However, in recent times, it has been proposed to deliver a benefit<br>
agent in a form whereby it is substituted onto another chemical moiety which increases<br>
its affinity for the substrate in'question.	<br>
Prior Art<br>
WO-A-98/00500 discloses detergent compositions comprising a peptide or protein deposition aid having a high affinity for fibres or a surface, and a benefit agent attached/adsorbed to the deposition aid. However, this deposition aid does not change chemically such as to increase its affinity for the substrate during the treatment process.<br>
GB-A-1 031 484 discloses stable aqueous dispersions of elastic copolymers which can be converted to cross-linked polymers by the action of heat or acid. They can be used to produce films or covering layers. However, none of the compounds has a benefit agent attached to the deposition enhancing part. There is no disclosure of using these materials in methods of laundry or fabric care.<br>
US-A-5 730 760 discloses a process of fabric washing in which a dye redeposition inhibitincpagent is used. The dye redeposition inhibiting polymer used is of a specific type, being produced by polymerising, for example, vinylester monomers. There is not any mention of materials having any surface substantive properties nor is there a description of any reaction by which such surface substantive properties increase during use.<br>
WO-A-92/13114 discloses hair fixative polymers which form a film after application. The polymers are fundamentally different from those of the present invention in that they do not comprise a deposition part attached to a benefit agent. The polymeric material has no particular affinity for hair - it is just applied onto it. There is certainly no mention of a reaction which increases the affinity. Any reaction which occurs leads to the cross-linking of polymer and the formation of film. It is not disclosed that the polymers should be water-soluble of dispersible - they are normally dissolved in an inert carrier such as alcohol.<br><br>
WO-A-95/35087 discloses a hair fixative amphoteric polymer composition. It is insoluble in water but can be solubilised by use of neutralisers or solubilising alcohol/water mixtures. The polymers do not to undergo any reaction which increases their affinity for hahv There is no benefit agent attached to the polymer.<br>
WO-A-98/29528 discloses cellulose ethers in which some substituents are (poly)alkoxylated, analogues of the latter in which the (poly)alkoxylated groups are terminated with a cationic moiety in the form of a quaternary ammonium group, and cellulose ethers in which some substituents are carboxylic acids in the salt form (i.e. the materials are essentially carboxymethylcellulose variants). None of these substituents in any variant is of a kind which would undergo a chemical change to enhance fabric affinity.<br>
WO-A-99/14245 discloses laundry detergent compositions containing cellulosic based polymers to provide appearance and integrity benefits to fabrics. These polymers are cellulosic polymers in which the saccharide rings have pendant oxygen atoms to which substituents 'R' are bonded, i.e. they are attached to the rings via an ether linkage. The groups 'R' can be hydrogen, lower alkyl or alkylene linkages terminated by carboxylic acid, ester or amide groups. Optionally, up to five alkyleneoxy groups may be interspersed between the groups are the respective oxygen atom. None of the pendant groups is a benefit agent group. However, at least some of these groups may undergo a chemical change such as hydrolysis, in the wash liquor. However no such change would result in an increased affinity for the fabric. On the contrary, because the "ester" group is configured with the carbonyl group closer to the polysaccharide than the oxygen atom (i.e. esters of carboxyalkyl groups), any hydrolysis will result in free acid substituents which will actually result in an increase in solubility and therefore, a decrease in affinity for the fabric.<br>
WO-A-99/14295 discloses structures analogous to those described in WO-A-99/14245 but in one alternative, the substituents 'R' together with the oxygen on the saccharide ring, constitute pendant half-esters of certain dicarboxylic acids. A single example of such a material is given. Again, no pendant group is a benefit agent group. However, the dicarboxylic acid half-esters would tend to hydrolyse in the wash liquor and thereby increase affinity of the material for a cotton fabric. However, first, this mechanism of<br><br>
WO 03/020819<br><br>
PCT7EP02/09228<br><br>
action or behaviour is not mentioned. Second, the hydrolysis rate of such dicarboxylic acids half esters is not as great as that of esters of monocarboxylic acids (which are not disclosed or claimed in WO-A-99/14295). Third, the degree of substitution for this variant is specified as being from 0.001 to 0.1. This is so low as to make the enhancement of fabric affinity too low to be worthwhile for this mechanism of action. Fourth, the structures described and claimed insofar as they have such half ester substituents, must also have substituents of the type which are carboxyalkyi groups or esters thereof, i.e. of the type also described in W0-A-99/14245. In the latter (ester) case, these would hydrolyse to the free acid form. The degree of substitution of the latter (0.2 to 2) is considerably higher than for the half-ester groups and the resultant increase in solubility would easily negate any enhanced affinity for the fabric by hydrolysis of the half-ester groups.<br>
WO-A-00/18861 provides a water-soluble or water-dispersible material for deposition onto a substrate during a treatment process, wherein the material comprises:<br>
(i)	a deposition enhancing part having a polymeric backbone; and<br>
(ii)	a benefit agent group attached to the deposition enhancing part by a<br>
hydrolytically stable bond;<br>
such that the material undergoes during the treatment process, a chemical change which does not involve the hydrolytically stable bond and by which change the affinity of the material onto the substrate is increased.  The preferred materials are substituted polysaccharides.<br>
WO-A-00/18861 mentions as possible benefit groups, lubricants, ironing aids and fabric softeners. However, it is known that silicone materials are especially useful agents for delivering this kind of benefit Our UK patent application no. 0121148.1, unpublished at the priority date of this application, describes and claims a substituted Si^ linked polysaccharide having covalently bonded on the polysaccharide moiety thereof, at least one deposition enhancing group which undergoes a chemical change in water at a use temperature to increase the affinity of the substituted polysaccharide to a substrate, the substituted polysaccharide further comprising one or more independently selected silicone chains.<br><br><br><br>
We have now found that these substituted polysaccharides can be incorporated in compositions containing a silicone perse to enhance deposition of the silicone.<br>

A further aspect of the invention provides the use of a composition according to the first aspect of the invention to enhance the softening benefit of a laundry treatment composition on a substrate.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
THE SILICONE<br>
Silicones are conventionally incorporated in laundry treatment (e.g. wash or rinse) compositions to endow antifoam, fabric softening, ease of ironing, anti-crease and other benefits. Any type of silicone can be used to impart the lubricating property of the present invention however, some silicones and mixtures of silicones are more preferred.<br>

- any organosilicone of formula H-SXC where SXC is any such group hereinafter defined, and derivatives thereof.<br>
-reactive silicones and phenyl silicones<br>
The choice of molecular weight of the silicones is mainly determined by processability factors. However, the molecular weight of silicones is usually indicated by reference to the viscosity of the material. Preferably, the silicones are liquid and typically have a viscosity in the range 20 cStokes to 300,000 cStokes. Suitable silicones include dimethyl, methyl (aminoethylaminoisobutyl) siloxane, typically having a viscosity of from 100 cStokes to 200 cStokes with an average amine content of ca. 2mol% and, for example; Rhodorsil Oil 21645, Rhodorsil Oil Extrasoft and Wacker Finish 1300.<br>

More preferably, the two R groups represent the same group preferably, a methyl, an ethyl, a propyl, a phenyl or a hydroxy group, "q" is preferably an integer from about 7 to about 8,000. "A" represents groups which block the ends of the silicone chains. Suitable A groups include hydrogen, methyl, methoxy, ethoxy, hydroxy, propoxy, and aryloxy.<br>
Preferred alkylsiloxanes include polydimethyl siloxanes having a viscosity of greater than about 10,000 centistokes (est) at 250C; and a most preferred silicone is a reactive silicone, i.e. where A is an OH group.<br>

Other useful silicone materials include materials of the formula:<br><br>
wherein x and y are integers which depend on the molecular weight of the silicone, the viscosity being from about 10,000 (est) to about 500,000 (est) at 25°C. This material is also known as "amodimethicone".<br>

THE SUBSTITUTED POLYSACCHARIDE<br>
In the substituted polysaccharide, the silicone chain is preferably attached to the polysaccharide by a covalent stable bond. That means that the bonding of the silicone should be sufficiently stable so as not to undergo hydrolysis in the environment of the treatment process for the duration of that process. For example, in laundry cleaning applications, the substituted polysaccharide should be sufficiently stable so that the bond between the silicone and polysaccharide does not undergo hydrolysis in the wash liquor, at the wash temperature, before the silicone has been deposited onto the fabric.<br>
Preferably, the bond between the silicone and the polysaccharide is such that the decay rate constant (kd) of the material in an aqueous solution at 0.01 wt% of the material together with 0.1 wt% of anionic surfactant at a temperature of 40°C at a pH of 10.5 is such that kd
The substituted polysaccharide of the present invention is water-soluble or water-dispersibte in nature and comprises a polysaccharide substituted with at least one silicone attached to the polysaccharide aid by a hydrolytically stable bond.<br>
By water-soluble, as used herein, what is meant is that the material forms an isotropic solution on addition to water or another aqueous solution.<br>
By water-dispersible, as used herein, what is meant is that the material forms a finely divided suspension on addition to water or another aqueous solution.<br>
By an increase in the affinity of the substituted polysaccharide for a substrate such as a textile fabric upon a chemical change, what is meant is that at some time during the treatment process, the amount of material that has been deposited is. greater when the chemical change is occurring or has occurred, compared to when the chemical change has not occurred and is not occurring, or is occurring more slowly, the comparison<br><br>
being made with all conditions being equal except for that change in the conditions which is necessary to affect the rate of chemical change.<br>
Deposition onto a substrate includes deposition by adsorption, co-crystallisation, entrapment and/or adhesion.<br>
The Polysaccharide Part<br>
The polysaccharide is preferably B1-4 linked and is a cellulose, a cellulose derivative, or another B1-4-linked polysaccharide having an affinity for cellulose, such as mannart and glucomannan.<br>
Preferably, the polysaccharide has only B1-4 linkages. Optionally, the polysaccharide has linkages in addition to the b1-4 linkages, such as &amp;1.3 linkages. Thus, optionally some other linkages are present Polysaccharide backbones which include some material which is not a saccharide ring are also within the ambit of the present invention (whether terminal or within the polysaccharide chain).<br>
The polysaccharide may be straight or branched. Many naturally occurring polysaccharides have at least some degree of branching, or at any rate at least some saccharide rings are in the form of pendant side groups (which are therefore not in themselves counted in determining the degree of substitution) on a main polysaccharide backbone.<br>
A polysaccharide comprises a plurality of saccharide rings which have pendant hydroxyl groups. In the substituted polysaccharides of the present invention, at least some of these hydroxyl groups are independently substituted by, or replaced with, one or more other substituents, at least one being a silicone chain. The "average degree of substitution" for a given class of substituent means the average number of substituents of that class per saccharide ring for the totality of polysaccharide molecules in the sample and is determined for ail saccharide rings.<br><br>
The Deposition Enhancing Group(s)<br>
A deposition enhancing group is a group which undergoes a chemical change in use, and is attached to the polysaccharide agent group by means of a covalent stable bond. This chemical change results in an increase of the affinity of the material for the substrate and is referred to further below.<br>
The chemical change which causes the increased substrate affinity is preferably ..caused by jiydrolysjs.,, perhydrolysis or.bond-cleava,ge, qptionally catalysed by an enzyme or another catalyst. Hydrolysis of substituent ester-finked groups is typical.<br>
By ester linkage is meant that the hydrogen of an -OH group has been replaced by a substituent such as R'-CO-, R'SOz- etc to form a carboxylic acid ester, sulphonic acid ester (as appropriate) etc together with the remnant oxygen attached to the saccharide ring. In some cases, the group R' may for example contain a heteroatom, e.g. as an -NH- group attached to the carbonyl, sulphonyl etc group, so that the linkage as a whole could be regarded as a urethane etc linkage. However, the term ester linkage is still to be construed as encompassing these structures.<br>
The average degree of substitution of these pendant groups which undergo the chemical change is preferably from 0.1 to 3 (e.g. from 0.3 to 3), more preferably from 0.1 toi (e.g. from 0.3 to 1)<br>
The Silicone Chain(s')<br>
As used herein the term "silicone chain" means a polysiloxane or derivative thereof. In the section "Preferred Overall Structure" hereinbelow, various preferred silicone chains are recited and these are typically suitable, whether or not the substituted polysaccharide conforms to the preferred overall structure,<br><br>
Preferred Overall Structures<br>
Preferred substituted polysaccharides of the invention are celluiosic polymers of formula (I):-<br><br>
(optional B^ and/or other linkages and/or other groups being permitted in the above formula (I)) wherein at least one or more -OR groups of the polymer are substituted by or replaced by independently selected silicone chains and at least one or more R groups are independently selected from groups of formulae:-<br><br><br>
Particularly preferred such groups are the monoacetate, hemisuccirtate, and 2-(2-hydroxy-1-oxopropoxy)propartoate. The term "monoacetate" is used herein to denote those acetates with the degree of substitution of 1 or less on a cellulose or other S-1,4 polysaccharide backbone.<br>
Cellulose esters of hydroxyacids can be obtained using the acid anhydride in acetic acid solution at 20-30°C and in any case below 50°C. When the product has dissolved the liquid is poured into water (b.p. 316,160). Tri-esters can be converted to secondary products as with the triacetate. Glycoliic and lactic ester are most common.<br>
Cellulose glycollate may also be obtained from cellulose chloracetate (GB-A-320 842) by treating 100 parts with 32 parts of NaOH in alcohol added in small portions.<br>
An alternative method of preparing cellulose esters consists in the partial displacement of the acid radical in a cellulose ester by treatment with another acid of higher ionisation constant (FR-A-702 116). The ester is heated at about 100°C with the acid which, preferably, should be a solvent for the ester. By this means cellulose acetate-oxalate, tartrate, maleate, pyruvate, salicylate and phenylglycollate have been obtained, and from cellulose tribenzoate a cellulose benzoate-pyruvate. A cellulose acetate-lactate or acetate-glycollate could be made in this way also. As an example cellulose acetate (10 g.) in dioxan (75 ml.) containing oxalic acid (10 g.) is heated at 100°C for 2 hours under reflux.<br>
Multiple esters are prepared by variations of this process. A simple ester of cellulose, e.g. the acetate, is dissolved in a mixture of two (or three) organic acids, each of which has an ionisation constant greater than that of acetic acid (1.82 x 10"5). With solid acids suitable solvents such as propionic acid, dioxan and ethylene dichloride are used. If a mixed cellulose ester is treated with an acid this should have an ionisation constant greater than that of either of the acids already in combination.<br>

In the case of those materials having a cellulose backbone and pendant ester groups, without being bound by any particular theory or explanation, the inventors have conjectured that the mechanism of deposition is as follows.<br>
Cellulose is substantially Insoluble in water. Attachment of the ester groups to make a cellulose derivative causes disruption of the hydrogen bonding between rings of the cellulose chain or chains, thus increasing water solubility or dispersibility. In the treatment liquor, the ester groups are hydrolysed, causing the cellulose derivative to increase its affinity for the substrate, e.g. the fabric.<br>
In the case when solubiiising groups are attached to the polysaccharide, this is typically via covalent bonding and, may be pendant upon the backbone or incorporated therein. The type of solubiiising group may alter according to where the group is positioned with respect to the backbone.<br>
In this specification the "n" subscript used in the general formulae of the substituted polysaccharide is a generic reference to a polymer. Although "n" can also mean the actual (average) number of repeat units present in the polysaccharide, it is more meaningful to refer to "n" by the number average molecular weight.<br>
The number average molecular weight (Mn) of the substituted polysaccharide part may typically be in the range of 1,000 to 200,000, for example 2,000 to 100,000, e.g. as measured using GPC with multiple angle laser scattering detection.<br>

Example A-Sample synthesis of an ester linked cellulose monoacetate (CMA) with grafted silicone<br>
Monocarboxydecyl terminated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) source (Mwt 5,000:1.5g, 0.23 mmdls) Was dispersed in dimethylacetamide (10cm3) by vigorous stirring under nitrogen. Carbonyldiimidazole (37 mg, 0.23 mmols) was then added and the dispersion heated with stirring to 70'C under nitrogen for two hours. A solution of ceflulose monoacetate (DS 0.58; 1 g, 5.3 mmol equivalents based on primary hydroxyl groups) in dimethylacetamide (10 cm3) was then added and stirring and heating was continued for a further 20 hours. Following this time the mixture was filtered and the filtrate added to vigorously stirring acetone to give a white precipitate. This precipitate was filtered off, washed with acetone and dried under vacuum to give a white polymer (1.01 g). From the 1H NMR of the polymer (after hydrolysis of 20% DCI in D20 for two hours at 80°C) and normalising the integration of the anomeric protons to unity and the acetate group to 0.58 the Si-CH3 group (at 0.0 ppm) integration gives an overall degree of substitution (DS) of siloxane groups of 0.0015 (hereinafter referred to as "Polymer A").<br>
