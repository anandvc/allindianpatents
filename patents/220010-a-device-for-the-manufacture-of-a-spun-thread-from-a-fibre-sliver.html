The present application has been divided as per section 16 of The Patent Act, 1970 from Indian Patent Application No.427/CHENP/2003 dated 21 March 2003 titled  Spinning Device .<br>
The invention relates to a device for the manufacture of a spun thread from a fibre sliver  encompassing a fibre conveying channel with a fibre guide surface for the guidance of the fibres of the fibre sliver into the inlet aperture mouth of a yam guidance channel, and further comprises a fluid device for the production of an eddy current around the inlet aperture mouth of the yam guidance channel.<br>
Such a device is known from DE 44 31 761 C2 (US 5,528,895) and is shown in Figures 1 and la. In this, fibres are guided through a fibre bundle passage 13 on a twisted fibre guidance surface, which exhibits a "rear" edge (4b) above a "front" edge (4c). The fibres are then guided around what is referred to as a needle (5) into a yam passage (7) of what is referred to as a spindle (6), whereby the rear part of the fibres are rotated by means of an eddy current generated by nozzles (3) about the front part of the fibres, already located in the yam passage, with a yam being formed as a result. Once this has been done, spinning takes place, as is described later in connection with the invention.<br>
The element referred to as the needle, and its tip about which the fibres are guided, is located close to or in the inlet aperture mouth (6c) of the yam passage (7) and serves as what is referred to as a false yam core, in order as far as possible to prevent or to reduce the possibility that, due to the fibres in the fibre bundle passage, an impermissibly high false twist of the intertwined fibres occurs, which would at least interfere with the formation of the yam if not even preventing it altogether.<br>
Figure lb shows this aforementioned prior art encumbered with disadvantages (DE 4131 059<br>
C2, U.S. Pat. No. 5,211,001), in that, as is known from DE 44 31 761, Figure 5, the fibres<br>
are not guided consistently about the needle as shown in Figure la, but	<br><br>
are guided on both sides of this needle against the inlet aperture mouth of the yam passage, which apparently interferes with the binding of the fibres and apparently can lead to a reduction of the strength of the spun yam.<br>
Figure Ic shows a further development of Figure 1, or la respectively, in that the fibre guidance surface (4b), as can be seen, is designed in a helical shape, and the fibres are accordingly likewise guided in helical form in their course from the clamping gap X as far as the end E 5 of the helical surface, and are then wound, still in helical form, about a fibre guidance pin, similar to the fibre guidance pin (5) of Figure 1, before the fibres are acquired by the rotating air flow and twisted to form a yam Y. In this situation it can be seen that the rear ends of the fibres f" are bent about the mouth part of the spindle (6), and in this context are taken up by the rotating air flow and wound around the front ends, which are already located in the centre of the fibre run, in order to form the yam as a result.<br>
Figure Ic corresponds to Figure 6 from DE 19603291 A 1 (U.S. Pat. No. 5,647,197), whereby the identification references of the spindle (6), the yam passage (7), and the venting cavity (8) have been adopted from Figure 1, while the element (e 2), which has a similar function to the needle (5) of Figures 1 to lb has been left as It was. It can likewise be seen from this Figure Ic that the fibres are transferred from a helical formation to the inlet of this spindle.<br>
A further prior art from the same Applicants is specified in JP3-10 63 68 (2), which, by contrast with Figure 1, does not exhibit a needle, but rather a truncated cone (6) with a flat fibre guidance surface, which is a part of the fibre guidance channel (13), and the tip of which is arranged essentially concentric to the fibre guidance run (7).<br><br>
The purpose of this cone is the same as that of the tip (5), namely of producing what is referred to as a false yam core in order to prevent the fibres from being incorrectly twisted; in other words, that a false twist occurs from the tip backwards against the clamping gap of the output rollers, which would at least in part prevent a true twist of the fibres such as to form the yam.<br>
The problem was therefore to find a method and device in which the fibres undergo fibre guidance by means of which the fibres can be taken up by the air eddy which is created in such a way that a uniform and firm yam can be produced.<br>
The problem was resolved in that a fibre guide surface exhibits a fibre delivery edge, over and by means of which the fibres are guided in a formation lying essentially flat next to one another, against an inlet aperture mouth of a yam guidance channel.<br>
Further advantageous embodiments are also described.<br>
The invention is described hereinafter in greater detail on the basis of drawings which represent only some means of implementation.<br>

Figure 1 shows a housing (1) with the housing parts (la) and (lb) and with a nozzle block (2) integrated in it which contains jet nozzles (3), by means of which an eddy current as described heretofore is created, as well as what is referred to as a needle holder (4) with the needle (5) inserted in it.<br>
As can be seen from Figure la, the eddy current produces a right-hand swirl in the direction of the arrow (seen looking towards the Figure), and accordingly the fibres (F) being delivered are conducted in this direction of rotation about the needle (5) against a face side (6a) of what is referred to as the spindle (6), and introduced into a yam passage (7) of the spindle (6). In this situation, a relatively large distance interval pertains between the nozzle block (2) and the face side (6a) of the spindle, since space must pertain in this distance interval for the needle (5) and its tip.<br><br>
The fibres (F) are conveyed in a fibre guidance channel (13) on what is referred to as the fibre guide surface, by way of an aspirated air flow, against the tip (5) of the needle (5).<br>
The aspirated air flow is created on the basis of an injector effect of the nozzle jets (3), which are provided in such a way that on the one hand the air eddy referred to is created, while on the other air is also sucked in through the fibre conveying charmel (13).<br>
This air escapes along a conical section (6b) of the spindle (6) through an air escape cavity (8) into an air outlet (10).<br>
The compressed air for the jet nozzles (3) is delivered to the Jet nozzles in a uniform manner by means of a compressed air distribution chamber (11).<br>
Figure lb, which represents the prior art to Figures 1 and la referred to heretofore, shows that this Figure, by contrast with Figure la, additionally exhibits a needle holder extension piece (4a'), which projects from a face surface (4') and contains the needle (5); i.e. the fibres are guided over the entire extension, which pertains because of the contour of the needle holder (4), against the inlet of the spindle (6).<br>
Figures Ic to le have already been dealt with in the preamble. In this situation, the identification numbers of these Figures which have not been mentioned do not have any explanation in this application. The disadvantage of these devices lies in the uncertain fibre guidance at a large distance interval from the face side of the needle holder (4) to the inlet mouth aperture (6c) in the face side (6a) of the spindle (6), as well as in the guidance of the fibres to or about the needle (5) or the cone element 6 of Figures Id and le respectively.<br><br>
Invention<br>
In order to alleviate these disadvantages, according to Figures 2-2c the invention exhibits a fibre delivery edge (29), which is located very close to an inlet mouth aperture (35) (Figure 2a) of a yam guidance channel (45), which is provided inside what is referred to as a spindle (32) and specifically to advantage with a specified distance interval A (Figure 2c) between the fibre delivery edge (29) and the inlet mouth aperture (35), and with a specified distance interval B between an imaginary plane E which contains the edge, this plane running parallel to a mid-line (47) of the yam guidance channel (45) and this aforesaid mid-line (47).<br>
In this situation the distance interval A, depending on the fibre type and mean fibre length, and on the relevant experimental results, corresponds to a range from 0.1 to 1.0 mm. The distance interval B depends on the diameter G of the inlet aperture mouth (35), and, depending on experimental results, lies within a range from 10 to 40% of the diameter G referred to.<br>
In addition to this, the fibre delivery edge exhibits a length D. 1 (Figure 2a), which is in a proportion of 1:5 to the diameter (G) of the yam guidance channel (45), and is formed by a face surface (30) (Figure 2) of a fibre conveying element (27) and a fibre guidance surface (28) of the element (27). In this situation the face surface (30), with a height (C) (Figure 2c), lies within the range of the diameter (G) and exhibits an empirically-determined distance interval (H) between the plane (E) and the inner wall (48) of the yam guidance channel (45) located opposite.<br><br>
The fibre conveying element (27) is guided in a carrier element (37) accommodated in a nozzle block (20), and together with this carrier element forms a free space which creates a fibre conveying channel (26).<br>
The fibre conveying element (27) exhibits at the inlet a fibre take-up edge (31), about which the fibres are guided, these being conveyed by a fibre conveying roller (39).<br>
These fibres are raised from the fibre conveying roller (39) by means of a suction air flow from the conveying roller, and conveyed through the fibre conveying channel (26). The suction air flow is created by an air flow generated in jet nozzles (21) with a blast direction (38), on the basis of an injector effect.<br>
The jet nozzles, as represented in Figures 2 and 2b, are arranged in a nozzle block (20) on the one hand at an angle p (Figure 2), in order to create the injector effect referred to heretofore, and, on the other, are offset at an angle a (Figure 2b), in order to create an air eddy which rotates with a direction of rotation (24) along a cone (36) of the fibre conveying element (27), and about the spindle front surface (34) (Figure 2a), in order, as described hereinafter, to form a yam in the yam guidance charmel (45) of the spindle (32).<br>
The air flow created by the nozzles (21) in an eddy chamber (22) escapes along a spindle cone (33), through an air escape channel (23) formed around the spindle (32), into the atmosphere or into a suction device.<br>
To form a yam (46) (Figure 2a), the fibres (F) which are delivered from the fibre conveying roller (39), are raised from the fibre conveying roller (39) by means of the suction air flow referred to in the fibre conveying channel (26), and are guided on the fibre guidance surface (28) in a conveying direction (25) (Figure 2) against the fibre<br><br>
delivery edge (29). From this delivery edge, front ends of the fibres are guided through the spindle inlet aperture mouth (35) into the yam guidance channel (45), while the rear ends or the rear part (49) of these fibres are folded over as soon as the rear ends are free and taken up by the rotating air flow, so that, with the further conveying of the fibres in the yam guidance channel (45), a yam (46) is created which exhibits a yam character similar to the ring yam.<br>
This process is represented in Figures 2.1 to 2b. 1. It can be seen in these that the fibres (F) delivered with the fibre delivery roller (39) are conducted in the conveying device (25) on the fibre guidance surface (28) against the fibre delivery edge (29), and specifically, as shown in Figure 2a. 1, with a converging fibre flow, which tapers increasingly towards the inlet aperture mouth (35) (Figure 2a). This tapering is applied because the front ends, which are already incorporated into the twisted yam (46), have a tendency to migrate in the direction of the tapering, so that front ends of fibres located further to the rear are likewise displaced in the direction of the tapering. This only happens, however, until the rear part (49) of the fibres (F) have been taken up by the air eddy referred to, and rotated around the spindle front surface (34) and drawn into the inlet aperture mouth (35) at the thread draw-off speed, in the process acquiring the twist necessary for the formation of the yam.<br>
In this Figure the width D.l (Figure 2a), as shown by the broken lines, is represented in extended form, specifically on the one hand in order to show that the width can be extended, and, on the other, likewise to show that this extended width will, under certain circumstances, reduce the size of the eddy chamber shown in Figure 2a, if not even changed with interfering effect, in that the eddy current can no longer develop therein in such a way that the fibre ends (49) can be taken up by the eddy flow with the energy required. This too must be determined by means of empirical experiments.<br><br>
The yam formation referred to heretofore takes place after the start of a spinning process of any kind, for example in which a yam end of an already existing yam is conducted back through the yam guidance channel (45) into the area of the spindle inlet aperture mouth (35) sufficiently far for fibres of this yam end to be opened sufficiently wide by the air flow, which is already rotating, that front ends of fibres which are newly conducted to the fibre guidance charmel (26) can be taken up by this rotating fibre sliver and, by repeat drawing of the yam end which has been introduced, can be held in the sliver such that the following rear parts of the newly-delivered fibres can be wound around the front ends which are already located in the mouth aperture section of the yam guidance channel, so that, as a consequence, the yam referred to can be respond with an essentially predetermined arrangement.<br>
The sequence has been described on the basis of an example in which the front end of a fibre, seen in the direction of conveying, is incorporated in the fibre sliver, and the rear end of this fibre is or becomes free to be "folded over". The process can, however, take place in an analogous manner in the case of an incorporated rear end of the fibres, whereby the front end is free, and, because of the axial component of the eddy air flow, is deposited at the spindle front surface (34). The fibre parts which are deposited on the spindle front surface (34) then rotate because of the eddy air flow, and are therefore wound around the fibre ends which have been bound in.<br>
Figures 3 and 3 a show a further embodiment of the fibre guidance channel (26) of Figures 2-2c, in this case as the fibre guidance surface (28.1) with an elevation (40) arranged at a distance interval (M) fi-om the fibre delivery edge (29), over which the delivered fibres slide before they reach the fibre delivery edge (29). In this situation the distance (M) corresponds to a maximum of 50% of the mean fibre length.<br><br>
The elevation exhibits a distance interval (N) to a fibre guidance surface without elevation, which lies within the range of 10 to 15% of the distance interval (M).<br>
The distance intervals (M) and (N) are to be determined empirically in accordance with the fibre type and fibre length.<br>
This elevation (40) can exhibit the shapes shown with Figures 3a-3d; i.e. the edge can be concave, according to Figure 3b, for example for "slippery" fibres to be explained later, convex according to Figure 3c for "sticky £ fibres, or, according to Figure 3d, wave-shaped. Correspondingly, the fibre guidance surfaces of Figures 3b to 3d are designated as 28.2, 28.3, and 28.4.<br>
These shapes serve to provide different fibre guidance on the fibre guidance surface (28.1-28.4), and are to be determined empirically according to the fibre type and fibre length. In this situation, the term "slippery" fibre is understood to mean such as exhibit weak mutual adhesion, and "sticky" fibres such as exhibit a stronger mutual adhesion.<br>
The elements which do not have characterization identification correspond to the elements in Figures 2 to 2c.<br>
A further advantage of the elevation lies in the fact that, due to the movement of the fibres over this point, a loosening of possible dirt particles inside the fibre sliver takes place, which are taken up by the conveying air flow and can be conveyed into the open air or into a suction device.<br><br>
Figures 4 and 4a show a further variant of the fibre guidance surface (28) of Figures 2-2c. According to this variant, the fibre guidance surface exhibits, at a distance interval P tom the fibre delivery edge (29) of a maximum of 50% of the mean fibre length, a depression (41) with a radius R.1, whereby the lowest point of the depression (41) is located lower than the edge (29) of Figures 2-2c. In this situation the depression (41) and the radius R. 1 are to be determined empirically on the basis of the fibre type and fibre length, and the depression (41) serves to prevent fibres (short fibres, for example) from moving away sideways, i.e. of being lost as wastage.<br>
As shown in Figure 4, this variant can also be combined with the elevation (40) (represented by a broken line) of Figures 3 and 3a or 3b to 3d.<br>
The elements which do not have characterizations identification correspond to the elements in Figures 2 to 2c.<br>
Figures 5-5b show a further variant of the design of the fibre delivery edge (29), in that the face surface (30.1) exhibits a convex rounding provided with a radius R.2, and in this situation the fibre delivery edge (29) acquired a width D.2. In this case too, the selection of the radius and the width is a matter of empirical experiments, in order to be able to adapt to the fibre type and fibre length in a way optimum for the yam formation. In this situation, measures can also be applied to influence the optimisation of the eddy chamber (22) from the technical flow point of view, as mentioned earlier.<br>
The elements which do not have characterisation identification correspond to the elements in Figures 2 to 2c.<br><br><br>
Figures 6-6b show a similar variation concept, inasmuch as, in this case, it is not a convex face side 30.1 which is provided for, but a concave face side 30.2, with a radius R.3 and an edge length of D.3. The radius R.3 and the edge length D.3 must be determined empirically according to the fibre length and the fibre type. These measures serve to influence the tapering mentioned earlier of the fibre at the inlet aperture mouth.<br>
The elements which do not have characterisation identification correspond to the elements in Figures 2 to 2c.<br>
Figures 7 and 7a show a variant of Figures 33 d, in which the fibre guidance surface consists in this case of a porous plate (42) made of sinter material, so that compressed air from a cavity (43) located beneath the porous plate (42) can flow in a very uniform and fine distribution through the porous plate and into the fibres located on this, so that, in a certain sense, a fluidisation of the fibres takes place, i.e. a homogenous mingling of air and fibres, which incurs a separation of fibre from fibre, and therefore an increase in the "slipperiness" referred to, i.e. a reduction of the adhesion of the fibres referred to heretofore due to the air located between the fibres.<br>
As a result of this separation, any dirt is more easily loosened and released, with the result that this dirt can be better acquired by the suction air flow at the transition over the intermediate elevation (40). The compressed air for the cavity (43) is introduced via the compressed air feed (44).<br><br>
The pressure in the cavity (43) is to be determined empirically in accordance with the porous plate and the tolerable air outlet speed from the porous surface, and specifically in such a way that the fibres from this air flow is not raised above a tolerable value from the fibre guidance surface.<br>
The porous plate is accommodated by the parts (27.1) and (27.2) of the fibre conveying element (27), whereby, because they contain the inlet edge and the fibre delivery edge of the fibres, these parts are made of a material which is more resistant to wear than a porous plate.<br>
Figure 8 shows a nozzle block from Figure 2.1 in combination with a drafting device (50), consisting of the inlet rollers (51), the apron pair (52) with the corresponding rollers, and the outlet roller pair (53), which delivers the fibre sliver (F) to the nozzle block (20). The fibres leave the drafting device (50) in a plane which contains the clamping line of the outer roller pair This plane can be offset in relation to the fibre guidance surface (28) in such a way that the fibre sliver is deflected at the fibre take-up edge (31) (see Figures 2 and 2a respectively).<br>
Figure 9 shows, as an alternative to the drafting device, a device in which a fibre sliver (54) is broken up into individual fibres and in the final stage is delivered by means of a suction roller (62) as a fibre sliver F to the nozzle block (20) of Figure 2.1. This device is the object of a PCT application with the number PCT/CH 01/00 217 by the same AppUcants, to which application reference is made as a constituent part of this application. An alternative can be derived from U.S. Pat. No. 6,058,693.<br><br>
The fibre sliver break-up device according to Figure 9 comprises a feed channel (55), in which the fibre sliver (54) is delivered to a feed roller (56), whereby the fibre sliver is conveyed onwards from the feed roller (56) to a needle roller or toothed roller (61), by which the fibre sliver is broken up into individual fibres. A feed trough (57) presses the fibre sliver (54) against the feed roller, in order thereby to feed the fibre sliver in metered fashion to the needle roller or toothed roller (61). In this situation the hinge (58) and the pressure spring (59) serve to allow for the necessary pressure force.<br>
In the next stage the needle roller (60) transfers the fibres to a suction roller (62). In this situation the dirt, identified by a T, is separated out.<br>
With the help of the suction force, the suction roller (62) holds the fibres tightly in the area delimited by A to B, seen in the direction of rotation, as far as the clamping point K. After this clamping point the fibres are released for fiirther conveying in the fibre guidance channel (26). In the channel (26) they are acquired by the air flow (25). The release referred to takes place, for example, because the suction effect on the suction roller (62) is no longer present after the clamping point K, for example because the cover connecting the points A and B (shown in Figure 9) is no longer provided after the clamping point K. The release can, however, be enhanced by means of an air blast (B 2), which blows through the holes (63) by means of the channel (B 2). This air blast (B 2) can, however, be dispensed with. The charmel (B 2) is supplied with compressed air via the channel (B 1).<br>
The fibres leave the suction roller (62) in a plane which contains the clamping line (K). This plane can be offset in relation to the fibre guidance surface (28) in such a way that the fibre sliver is deflected at the fibre take-up edge (31) (see Figures 2 and 2a respectively).<br><br>
As far as the drafting device from Figure 8 is concerned, this is a generally known drafting device system, and it is accordingly not considered in any fiirther detail.<br>
From Figures 8 and 9 it can be seen that the fibre conveying charmel (26) is provided with a fibre guidance surface (28), which is designed without a twist (or without a helix) (see Figures la and Ic respectively). The fibre guidance surface (28) leads to a fibre delivery edge (29), which is positioned in relation to the inlet aperture mouth (35) of the yam guidance channel in such a way that the fibre sliver (F) must come in contact with the edge (29) in order to enter into the inlet aperture mouth (35). As a result of this, a continuation of a yam rotation, upstream of the edge (29), is prevented or at least substantially reduced.<br>
It can be seen from the same figures that the fibre conveying channel (26) is located on the one hand entirely on one side of an imaginary plane (not shown) running perpendicular seen looking towards Figure 2, and contains the mid-line (47) of the yam channel (45). The fibre conveying charmel (26), on the other hand, is also mn close to the inlet aperture mouth (35) of the yam guidance channel (45) in such a way that in the combination of the two measures at least a part of the fibre sliver (F) must be deflected in order to pass out of the fibre conveying channel (26) into the yam guidance channel (45) (see Figure la and Ic respectively, where, as a departure to what has gone before, a substantial distance interval pertains between the end of the fibre guidance channel and the spindle, in order to allow for the provision of the needle (5) in the intermediate space).<br>
■17-<br><br>
In the preferred embodiment (Figures 8 and 9), the fibre delivery edge (29) of the fibre conveying channel (26) is provided in a plane (E) (Figure 2c) parallel to the first plane mentioned, containing the mid-line (47), said plane being arranged at a predetermined interval (B) from the plane first referred to.<br>
Figures 8 and 9 also show that the fibres which in operation leave the fibre conveying channel (26) enter directly into the area (space (22), Figure 2) in which the eddy flow is present. This also represents a change in relation to the arrangement according to Figure 1, because in this latter arrangement a distance interval pertains between the end of the fibre guidance channel (13) and the plane in which the outlet aperture mouths of the blower nozzles (3) are located.<br><br><br>
