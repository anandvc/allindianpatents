				<td>MACROLIDES WITH ANTI-INFLAMMATORY ACTIVITY<br>
This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/643,841 filed January 13, 2005, and U.S. Provisional Application 60/715,828 filed September 9, 2005, each of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to substituted macrolides having anti-inflammatory activity, their pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives, and to methods of use thereof.<br>
Technical Problem<br>
The invention is directed to solving the technical problem of providing novel targeted anti-inflammatory agents. More specifically, the invention provides anti-inflammatory agents wherein the active substance is neither a steroid nor an NSAID. The compounds of the invention are responsive to this problem by virtue of then: anti-inflammatory activity and their ability to accumulate in various immune cells recruited to the locus of inflammation.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Inflammation is the final common pathway of various insults, such as infection, trauma, allergies to the human body. It is characterized by activation of the immune system with recruitment of inflammatory cells, production of pro-inflammatory cells and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.<br>
Most inflammatory diseases are characterized by abnormal accumulation of inflammatory cells including monocytes/macrophages, granulocytes, plasma cells, lymphocytes and platelets. Along with tissue endothelial cells and fibroblasts, these inflammatory cells release a complex array of lipids, growth factors, cytokines and destructive enzymes that cause local tissue damage.<br>
One form of inflammatory response is neutrophilic inflammation which is characterized by infiltration of the inflamed tissue by neutrophil polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMN), which are a major component of host defence. Tissue infection by extracellular bacteria represents the prototype of this inflammatory response. On the other hand, various non-infectious<br>
diseases are characterized by extravascular recruitment of neutrophils. This group of inflammatory diseases includes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, adult respiratory distress syndrome, some types of immune-complex alveolitis, cystic fibrosis, bronchitis, bronchiectasis, emphysema, glomerulonephritis, rheumatoid arthritis, gouty arthritis, ulcerative colitis, certain dermatoses such as psoriasis and vasculitis. In these conditions neutrophils are thought to play a crucial role in the development of tissue injury which, when persistent, can lead to the irreversible destruction of the normal tissue architecture with consequent organ dysfunction. Tissue damage is primarily caused by the activation of neutrophils followed by their release of proteinases and increased production of oxygen species.<br>
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is described by the progressive development of airflow limitation that is not fully reversible (ATC, 1995). Most patients with COPD have three pathological conditions: bronchitis, emphysema and mucus plugging. This disease is characterized by a slowly progressive and irreversible decrease in forced expiratory volume in the first second of expiration (FEVi), with relative preservation of forced vital capacity (FVC) (Barnes, N. Engl. J. Mod. (2000), 343(4): 269-280). In both asthma and COPD there is significant, but distinct, remodeling of airways. Most of the airflow obstruction is due to two major components, alveolar destruction (emphysema) and small airways obstruction (chronic obstructive bronchitis). COPD is mainly characterized by profound mucus cell hyperplasia.<br>
Cigarette smoking, air pollution and other environmental factors are major causes of the disease. The causal mechanism remains currently undefined but oxidant-antioxidant disturbances are strongly implicated in the development of the disease. COPD is a chronic inflammatory process that differs markedly from that seen in asthma, with different inflammatory cells, mediators, inflammatory effects, and responses to treatment (Keatings et al, Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. (1996), 153: 530-534). Neutrophil infiltration of the patient's lungs is a primary characteristic of COPD.<br>
Elevated levels of proinflammatory cytoldnes like TNF-ct, and especially chemokines like IL-8 and GRO-a play a very important role in pathogenesis of this disease. Platelet thromboxane synthesis is also enhanced in patients with COPD (Keatings et al., AmJ. Respir. Crit. Care Med. (1996), 153: 530-534; StocMey and Hill, Thorax (2000), 55(7): 629-630). Most of the tissue damage is caused by activation of neutrophils followed by their release of<br>
(metallo)proteinases, and increased production of oxygen species (Repine et al., Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. (1997), 156: 341-357; Barnes, Chest (2000), 117(2 Suppl): 10S-14S).<br>
Most therapeutic endeavour is directed towards the control of symptoms (Barnes, Trends Pharm. Sci. (1998), 19(10): 415-423; Barnes, Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. (1999) 160: S72-S79; Hansel et al., Expert Opin. hwestig. Drugs (2000) 9(1): 3-23). Symptoms usually equate with airflow limitation and bronchodilators are the conventional therapy of choice. Prevention and treatment of complications, prevention of deterioration and improved quality and length of life are also primary goals stated in the three key international guidelines for the management of COPD (Culpitt and Rogers, Exp. Opin. Pharmacother. (2000) 1(5): 1007-1020; Hay, Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. (2000), 4: 412-419). Basically, most of the current therapeutic research has been focused on mediators involved in the recruitment and activation of neutrophils, or attenuation of consequences of their undesirable activation (Stockley et al., Chest (2000), 117(2 Suppl): 58S-62S).<br>
la 1975, TNF-a was defined as an endotoxin-induced serum factor causing tumor necrosis in vitro and in vivo (Carswell E. A. et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.SA. 1975, 72, 3666-3670). In addition to antitumor activity, TNF-a has several other biologic activities that are important in homeostasis as well as in pathophysiological conditions. The main sources of TNF-a are monocytes-macrophages, T-lymphocytes and mast cells.<br>
The finding that anti-TNF-a antibodies (cA2) are effective in the treatment of patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (Elliot M. et al. Lancet 1994, 344, 1105-1110) intensified the interest to find new TNF-a inhibitors as possible potent medicaments for RA. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune chronic inflammatory disease characterized by irreversible pathological changes of the joints. In addition to RA, TNF-a antagonists are also applicable to several other pathological conditions and diseases such as spondylitis, osteoarthritis, gout and other arthritic conditions, sepsis, septic shock, toxic shock syndrome, atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, psoriasis, glomerulonephritis, lupus erhythematosus, scleroderma, asthma, cachexia, chronic obstructive lung disease, congestive heart failure, insulin resistance, lung fibrosis, multiple sclerosis, Crohns disease, ulcerative colitis, viral infections and ADDS.<br>
The interest of the scientific community has recently turned towards the immunomodulating and anti-inflammatory activities of the macrolide antibiotics (Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, 1988, 41, Suppl. B, 37-46).<br>
An ideal immunomodulating agent should be able to suppress the deleterious effects of the inflammatory response, while leaving the protective immune responses intact.<br>
Macrolide antibiotics accumulate preferentially within different cells of subjects, especially within phagocyte cells such as mononuclear peripheral blood cells, and peritoneal and alveolar macrophages. (Gladue, R. P. et al, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1989, 33, 277-282; Olsen, K. M, et al, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1996, 40, 2582-2585). Anti-inflammatory effects of some macrolides have been described in the literature. For example, the anti-inflammatory effect of erythromycin derivatives (J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1998, 41, 37-46; WO Patent Application No. 00/42055). Taisho claims further anti-inflammatory erythromycin derivatives modified in positions 3, 9, 11 and 12 (EP 0775489 and EP 0771564). In the patent application WO 02/087596, there is a good description of the anti-inflammatory activity of azithromycin, &amp; known antibacterial agent. Azithromycin derivatives lacking the sugar moieties cladinose and desosamine and having anti-inflammatory activity have been described (Pliva, US 4,886,792). International patent applications WO 04/039821 and WO 04/013153 (Zambon Group) disclose macrolide and azalide derivatives lacking cladinose sugar that exhibit anti-inflammatory but not antibacterial activity.<br>
Anti-inflammatory effects of some macrolides are also known from in vitro and in vivo studies in experimental animal models such as in zymosan-induced peritonitis in mice (J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1992, 30, 339-348) and endotoxin-induced neutrophil accumulation in rat trachea (/. Immunol. 1997,159,3395-4005). The modulating effect of macrolides upon cytokines such as interleukin 8 (IL-8) (Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care. Med. 1997, 156, 266-271) and interleukin 5 (IL-5) (EP Pat. No. 0775489 and EP Pat. No. 771564) is known as well.<br>
Macrolides have proved to be useful in the treatment of inflammatory pathologies such as panbronchiolitis (Thorax, 1997, 52, 915-918), bronchial asthma (Chest, 1991, 99 670-673), and azithromycin in particular has proved effective in improving lung function in patients with cystic fibrosis (The Lancet, 1998,351,420).<br>
The administration of macrolides to asthmatics is accompanied by a reduction in hypersecretion and in bronchial hypersensitivity resulting from the macrolides, anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory interaction with phagocytes and in particular with neutrophilis (Inflammation, Vol. 20, No. 6,1996).<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
New 14- and 15-membered macrolide compounds substituted at the 4" position of cladinose sugar moiety, represented by the Formula (I), representing the subject of the present invention, their pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives and pharmaceutical compositions comprising them have hitherto not been described. Moreover, no compound representing the subject of the present invention has been described either as an anti-inflammatory substance or as an inhibitor of one or more of TNF-a, IL-1 (IL-la or IHP), IL-6, IL-8, IL-2 or IL-5; and/or inhibitor of excessive lymphocyte proliferation; and/or excessive granulocyte degranulation. Consequently, the use of such compounds to combat inflammatory states has not been described or suggested. Nor has there been a description or suggestion of pharmaceutical dosage forms containing effective amounts of a 14- and 15-membered macrolide compounds substituted at the 4" position for treating inflammatory states in a mammalian subject, including a human.<br>
A characteristic of compounds represented by Formula (I) is selective accumulation in target organs and cells in the above mentioned inflammatory diseases and conditions. These pharmacokmetic properties enable the compounds represented by Formula I to act at the inflammation site in inflammation cells by inhibiting the production of inflammation mediators. In such a manner, the unfavourable systemic side-effects that are characteristic of corticosteroids or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory molecules are avoided and the therapeutic action of compounds represented by Formula (I) is targeted to the area where it is most needed. Following local or systemic application, molecules rapidly accumulate in inflammation cells wherein they act by inhibiting the production of cytokines and chemokines and/or other inflammatory mediators thus suppressing the inflammation.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable", as used in connection with compositions of the invention, refers to molecular entities and other ingredients of such compositions that are physiologically tolerable and do not typically produce untoward reactions when administered to a mammal (e.g., human). Preferably, as used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable" means approved by a regulatory agency of the Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or other generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in mammals, and more particularly in humans.<br>
The term "carrier" applied to pharmaceutical compositions of the invention refers to a diluent, excipient, or vehicle with which an active compound is administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be sterile liquids, such as water, saline solutions, aqueous dextrose solutions, aqueous glycerol solutions, and oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and the like. However, since the macrolides are highly soluble, aqueous solutions are preferred. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in "Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences" by E.W. Martin, 18th Edition, incorporated by reference. Particularly preferred for the present invention are carriers suitable for immediate-release, i.e., release of most or all of the active ingredient over a short period of time, such as 60 minutes or less, and make rapid absorption of the drug possible.<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable derivative" as used herein means any pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate or prodrug, e.g. ester, of a compound of the invention, which upon administration to the recipient is capable of providing (directly,or indirectly) a compound of the invention, or an active metabolite or residue thereof. Such derivatives are recognizable to those skilled in the art, without undue experimentation. Nevertheless, reference is made to the teaching of Burger's Medicinal Chemistry and Drug Discovery, 5th Edition, Vol 1: Principles and Practice, which is incorporated herein by reference to the extent of teaching such derivatives. Preferred pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives are salts, solvates, esters, carbamates and phosphate esters. Particularly preferred pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives are salts, solvates and esters. Most preferred pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives are salts and esters.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be in the form of and/or may be administered as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. For a review on suitable salts see Berge et al., J. Pharm. Sci., 1977,66,1-19, incorporated by reference.<br>
Typically, a pharmaceutical acceptable salt may be readily prepared by using a desired acid or base as appropriate. The salt may precipitate from solution and be collected by filtration or may be recovered by evaporation of the solvent. For example, an aqueous solution of an acid such as hydrochloric acid may be added to an aqueous suspension of a compound of formula (I) and the resulting mixture evaporated to dryness (lyophilised) to obtain the acid addition salt as a solid. Alternatively, a compound of formula (I) may be dissolved in a suitable<br>
solvent, for example an alcohol such as isopropanol, and the acid may be added in the same solvent or another suitable solvent. The resulting acid addition salt may then be precipitated directly, or by addition of a less polar solvent such as diisopropyl ether or hexane, and isolated by filtration.<br>
Suitable addition salts are formed from inorganic or organic acids which form non-toxic salts and examples are hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, sulphate, bisulphate, nitrate, phosphate, hydrogen phosphate, acetate, trifluoroacetate, maleate, rnalate, fumarate, lactate, tartrate, citrate, formate, gluconate, succinate, pyruvate, oxalate, oxaloacetate, trifluoroacetate, saccharate, benzoate, alkyl or aryl sulfonates (e.g. methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate or p-toluenesulfonate) and isothionate. Representative examples include trifluoroacetate and formate salts, for example the bis- or tris-trifluoroacetate salts and the mono or diformate salts, in particular the bis- or tris-trifluoroacetate salt and the monoformate salt.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable base salts include ammonium salts, alkali metal salts such as those of sodium and potassium, alkaline earth metal salts such as those of calcium and magnesium and salts with organic bases, including salts of primary, secondary and tertiary amines, such as isopropylamine, diethylamine, ethanolamine, trimethylamine, dicyclohexyl amine and N-methyl-D-glucamine.<br>
Compounds of the invention may have both a basic and an acidic center and may therefore be in the form of zwitterions.<br>
Those skilled in the art of organic chemistry will appreciate that many organic compounds can form complexes with solvents in which they are reacted or from which they are precipitated or crystallized. These complexes are known as "solvates". For example, a complex with water is known as a "hydrate". Solvates of the compound of the invention are within the scope of the invention. The salts of the compound of formula (I) may form solvates (e.g. hydrates) and the invention also includes all such solvates.<br>
The term "prodrug" as used herein means a compound which is converted within the body, e.g. by hydrolysis in the blood, into its active form that has medical effects. Pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs are described in T. Higuchi and V. Stella, "Prodrugs as Novel Delivery Systems", Vol. 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series, Edward B. Roche, ed., "Bioreversible<br>
Carriers in Drug Design", American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987, and in D. Fleisher, S, Ramon and H. Barbra "Improved oral drug delivery: solubility limitations overcome by the use of prodrugs", Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews (1996) 19(2) 115-130, each of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Prodrugs are any covalently bonded carriers that release a compound of structure (I) in vivo when such prodrug is administered to a patient. Prodrugs are generally prepared by modifying functional groups in a way such that the modification is cleaved, either by routine manipulation or in vivo, yielding the parent compound. Prodrugs include, for example, compounds of this invention wherein hydroxy, amine or sulfhydryl groups are bonded to any group that, when administered to a patient, cleaves to form the hydroxy, amine or sulfhydryl groups. Thus, representative examples of prodrugs include (but are not limited to) acetate, formate and benzoate derivatives of one or more of alcohol, sulfhydryl and amine functional groups of the compounds of structure (1). Further, in the case of a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group, esters may be employed, such as methyl esters, ethyl esters, and the like. Esters may be active in their own right and/or be hydrolysable under in vivo conditions in the human body. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable in vivo hydrolysable ester groups include those which break down readily in the human body to leave the parent acid or its salt.<br>
References hereinafter to a compound according to the invention include both compounds of formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives.<br>
With regard to stereoisomers, the compounds of structure (I) have more than one asymmetric carbon atom. In the general formula (I) as drawn, the solid wedge shaped bond indicates that the bond is above the plane of the paper. The broken bond indicates that the bond is below the plane of the paper.<br>
It will be appreciated that the substituents on the macrolide may also have one or more asymmetric carbon atoms. Thus, the compounds of structure (I) may occur as individual enantiomers or diastereomers. All such isomeric forms are included within the present invention, including mixtures thereof.<br>
Where a compound of the invention contains an alkenyl group, cis (Z) and trans (E) isomerism may also occur. The present invention includes the individual stereoisomers of the<br>

While it is possible that, for use in the methods of the invention, a compound of formula I may be administered as the bulk substance, it is preferable to present the active ingredient in a pharmaceutical formulation, e.g., wherein the agent is in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier selected with regard to (he intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice.<br>
The corresponding preparations of the compounds of the present invention can be used in the prophylaxis (including without limitation the prevention, delay or inhibition of recurrence of one or more of the clinical or subclinical symptoms discussed and defined in connection with the definitions of "treatment" above, as well as in the therapeutic treatment of several diseases and pathological inflammatory conditions including: chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), asthma, inflammatory nasal diseases such as allergic rhinitis, nasal polyps, intestinal diseases such as Crohn's disease, colitis, intestinal inflammation, ulcerative colitis, dermatological inflammations such as eczema, psoriasis, allergic dermatitis, neurodermatitis, pruritis, conjunctivitis and rheumatoid arthritis.<br>
The term "carrier" refers to a diluent, excipient, and/or vehicle with- which an active compound is administered. The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may contain combinations of more than one carrier. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be sterile liquids, such as water, saline solutions, aqueous dextrose solutions, aqueous glycerol solutions, and oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and the like. Water or aqueous solution saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions are preferably employed as carriers, particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in "Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences" by E.W. Martin, 18th Edition. The choice of pharmaceutical carrier can be selected with regard to the intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice.

There may be different composition/formulation requirements depending on the different delivery systems. It is to be understood that not all of the compounds need to be administered by the same route. Likewise, if the composition comprises more than one active component, then those components may be administered by the same or different routes. By way of example, the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may be formulated to be delivered using a mini-pump or by a mucosal route, for example, as a nasal spray or aerosol for inhalation or ingestible solution, or parenterally in which the composition is formulated by an injectable form, for delivery, by, for example, an intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous route. Alternatively, the formulation may be designed to be delivered by multiple routes.<br>
The present invention further relates to pharmaceutical formulations containing a therapeutically effective quantity of a compound of formula I or one of its salts mixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle. The pharmaceutical formulations of the present invention can be liquids that are suitable for oral, mucosal and/or parenteral administration, for example, drops, syrups, solutions, injectable solutions that are ready for use or are prepared by the dilution of a freeze-dried product but are preferably solid or semisolid as tablets, capsules, granules, powders, pellets, pessaries, suppositories, creams, salves, gels, ointments; or solutions, suspensions, emulsions, or other forms suitable for administration by the transdennal route or by inhalation.<br>
The compounds of the invention can be administered for immediate-, delayed-, modified-, sustained-, pulsed-or controlled-release applications.<br>
The compound can also be incorporated into a formulation for treating inflammation localized in an organ or tissue, e.g., Crohn's disease, where it can be administered orally or rectally. Formulations for oral administration can incorporate excipients enabling bioavailability of the compound at the site of inflammation. This can be achieved by different<br>
combinations of enteric and delayed release formulations. The compound of Formula I can also be used in the treatment of Crohn's disease and intestinal inflammation disease if the compound is applied in the form of a clyster, for which a suitable formulation can be used, as is well known in the field.<br>
In some embodiments, the oral compositions are slow, delayed or positioned release (e.g., enteric especially colonic release) tablets or capsules. This release profile can be achieved without limitation by use of a coating resistant to conditions within the stomach but releasing the contents in the colon or other portion of the GI tract wherein a lesion or inflammation site has been identified. Or a delayed release can be achieved by a coating that is simply slow to disintegrate. Or the two (delayed and positioned release) profiles can be combined in a single formulation by choice of one or more appropriate coatings and other excipients. Such formulations constitute a further feature of the present invention.<br>
Formulations for oral administration can be so designed to enable bioavailability of the compound at the site of inflammation in the intestines. This can be achieved by different combinations of delayed release formulations. The compound of Formula I can also be used in the treatment of Crohn's disease and intestinal inflammation disease if the compound is applied in the form of an enema, for which a suitable formulation can be used.<br>

The efficacy of the present compounds can be assessed by any method for assessing inflammation or anti-inflammatory effect. There are many known methods for this purpose including without limitation use of contrast ultrasound in conjunction with injection of microbubbles, measurement of inflammatory cytokines (such as TNF-α, IL-1, IFN-γ) measurement of activated immune system cells (activated T cells, cytotoxic T cells specifically recognizing the inflamed or transplanted tissue) as well as by observation (reduction of oedema, reduction of erythema, reduction of pruritus or burning sensation, reduction of body temperature, improvement in function of the afflicted organ) as well as any of the methods provided below.<br>
Administration may be once a day, twice a day, or more often, and may be decreased during a maintenance phase of the disease or disorder, e.g. once every second or third day instead of every day or twice a day. The dose and the administration frequency will depend on the clinical signs, which confirm maintenance of the remission phase, with the reduction or absence of at least one or more preferably more than one clinical signs of the acute phase known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
Biological Assays<br>
The therapeutic effect of compounds of the present invention was determined in in vitro and in vivo experiments such as the following.<br>
The cytokines assayed in the biological examples, when expressed at elevated amounts, are markers for inflammation and, in the case of cell proliferation, granulocyte degranulation and lung neutrophilia, the behaviors of these immune cells are also markers for their activation and, therefore, inflammation. Consequently, reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression or secretion and reduction in cell proliferation, degranulation or neutrophil accumulation is a measure of a compound's anti-inflammatory activity. Lung neutrophilia specifically serves as a model for COPD.<br>
A compound analyzed using the biological assays as defined herein is considered to be "active" if it is better than a positive control (i.e., azithrornycin) in at least one inhibitory function (i.e., inhibition of TNF-α or IL-6) after stimulation with al least one stimulant (e.g., PMA or PHA). More preferably, an active compound exhibits more than 50% inhibition in at least one inhibitory function<br>

Accumulation In granulocvtes<br>
7.5 x 106 granulocytes, isolated as described above, were suspended in 3 mL of RPMI1640 (Institute of Immunology, Croatia) containing 10 uM of tested macrolide. Samples were incubated at 37°C for 180 rain. Following incubation, the samples were centrifuged through the layer of PolyCdimethylsiloxane-co-diphenylsiloxane), dihydroxy terminated - silicone oil (Aldrich Chemical Company, Milwaukee, USA). The pellet was resuspended in 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma, St. Louis, USA) in deionized water (MilliQ, Millipore Corporation, Bedford, USA). The suspension was sonicated, proteins were precipitated with aeetonitrile, and the concentration of macrolide in the supernatants was determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).<br>
Jntracellular concentrations of the test compounds were calculated from the mean cell number recovered after centrifuging through silicone oil. According to the literature, about 1 million neutrophils is considered to have a volume of 0.24 nL (Vazifeh et al., Antimicrob Agents Chemo. 1997; 41: 2099-2107). To estimate the extent of macrolide accumulation, the intracellular to extracellular concentration ratio (I/E) was calculated, where E (due to a large volume of incubation medium) was taken as constant (10 |*M). Results are expressed relative to azithromycin according to the following equation: % of azithromycin uptake = (I/E of a substance / I/E of azithromycin) x 100. I/E values obtained for azithromycin were 164±10. (Table Removed)<br>

Cytotoxicity assay Hep G2 and A549 cell lines<br>
To determine whether the anti-inflammatory activity of the test compounds was due to observed inhibition of cytokine production and inhibition of proliferation in vitro, and was not a consequence of cellular cytotoxicity, measurement of succinate dehydrogenase activity in living cells was performed. Cells were cultured for 24 h in RPM medium as described above at 37°C the presence of the test compounds at concentrations of 50 uM and 12.5 uM. MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide] (Promega, USA), a detection reagent, was then added and the cultures were incubated for 0.5 - 2 h. The amount of MTT-Formazan produced was determined using a spectrophotometer at 490 nm (Mosmann, J. tamunol. Methods, 1983,65: 55-63).<br>

Besides accumulation of inflammatory cells in BALF, the extent and anatomic site of pulmonary inflammation induced by LPS was assessed 24 hours after PBS or LPS exposure. Accumulation of granulocytes and mononuclear cells in peribronchial (PB) and perivascular (PV) lung tissue areas and in alveolar spaces was monitored following sacrifice of the animals.<br>
Challenge with LPS induced significant accumulation of both granulocytes and mononuclear cells in lung tissue in comparison to groups challenged with PBS (negative control). The tested compounds significantly decreased accumulation of both granulocytes and mononuclears in lung tissue (PB and PV).<br>
