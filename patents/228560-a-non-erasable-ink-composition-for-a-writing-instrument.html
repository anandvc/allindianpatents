POLYURETHANE BASED INKS FOR WRITING INSTRUMENTS<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION The present invention relates to ink compositions for writing instruments, methods of making such ink compositions and writing instruments making use of the ink composition. The non-erasable ink compositions comprise an isocyanate free thermoplastic polyurethane resin, organic solvent(s), and colorant(s). Inks in accordance with the present invention are useful in pens for handwriting.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Many attempts have been made to improve the performance of writing inks (reduce seepage, reduce skipping, modify viscosity for better flow and smoothness of writing) by incorporating additives, resins, solvents, waxes, etc. into the ink formulations. To our knowledge, no solvent-based non-erasable writing inks exist in the patent literature which use an isocyanate free thermoplastii polyurethane resin.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,942,027 to Bcai discloses a solvent based writing ink which contains a sub-micron dispersion of silica to achieve non-seepage. Ikai does not disclose the use of an isocyanate free thermoplastic polyurethane resin to achieve a well functioning writing ink. U.S. Patent No. 5,868,511 to Osada discloses a solvent based ink with good writing characteristics and long cap off time which contains a resin dissolved in solvent with a colorant. However, Osada's patent does not disclose the use of an isocyanate free thermoplastic polyurethane resin to achieve a functional writing ink. U.S. Patent No. 4,525,216 to Nakanishi discloses a non-aqueous erasable ink which contains organic solvent, colorant, resin, an alkylamide, and a sorbitan fatty acid. Nakanishi does not disclose the use of an isocyanate free polyurethane resin to achieve good writing characteristics.<br>
Solvent based writing ink formulations which contain dissolved resins and dissolved or dispersed colorants are known in the art. U. S. Patent No. 5,980,624 to Ichikawa discloses a writing ink which contains a resin dissolved in a solvent with a colorant but does not disclose the use of an isocyanate free polyurethane resin. U. S. Patent No. 6,048,914 to Goto discloses a writing ink which contains a resin dissolved in a solvent with a colorant but does not disclose the use of an isocyanate free polyurethane resin. U. S. Patent No. 6,160,035 to Idogawa discloses a writing ink which contains a resin dissolved in<br><br>
a solvent with a colorant but does not disclose the use of an isocyanate free polyurethane resin.<br>
Inks comprising reactive polyurethanes are known in the printing ink art. U.S. Patent No. 5,248,752 to Argyropoulos et al. discloses the use of polyurethane meth(acrylate) polymers which react either thermally or by actinic radiation for use in inks. U.S. Patent No. 4,003,751 to Carder discloses an ink composition comprising at least cofunctional acrylate-urethane which will react either thermally or by actinic radiation. U.S. Patent No. 3,728,298 to Hartmann discloses the use of a printing ink based upon a polyurethane resin which is applied in a relatively uncured state, and is permitted to cure in room temperature under the action of curing agents. U.S. Patent No. 3,728,298 further discloses a pot life of approximately forty hours. None of these references disclose the use of an isocyanate free thermoplastic polyurethane resin in writing inks.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,812,492 to Eckes discloses the use of aqueous pigment dispersions containing a finely divided inorganic and/or organic pigment, an aqueous polyurethane dispersion, water and optionally organic solvent. U.S. Patent No. 4,812,492 does not disclose solvent soluble colorants or the non-aqueous thermoplastic polyurethane resin of the present invention.<br>
U. S. Patent No. 4,389,499 to Riesgraf discloses an erasable writing ink which contains a resin dissolved in a solvent with a colorant. U. S. Patent No. 4,390,646 to Ferguson discloses an erasable writing ink which contains a thermoplastic block copolymer resin dissolved in a solvent with a colorant.  U. S. Patent No. 4,391,927 to Fanner discloses an erasable writing ink which contains a thermoplastic block copolymer resin dissolved in a solvent with a colorant. These references do not disclose the non-erasable ink compositions of the present invention.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,852,072 to Banning et al. discloses an erasable ink composition containing a water-insoluble polymeric dye obtained from the polymerization of at least two coreactive polyfunctional monomers with at least one of the monomers possessing a dye moiety covalently bonded thereto. The ink is intended for marking instrument, particularly ballpoint pens. U.S. Patent No. 5,852,072 does not disclose the isocyanate free polyurethane resin or the non-erasable ink compositions of the present invention.<br>
Like U.S. Patent No. 5,852,072, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,756,561 to Wang, 5,900,445 to Chandler and 5,852,073 to Villiger discloses inks for ballpoint pens using<br><br>
polyurethanes. These references do not disclose the isocyanate free polyurethane resin or the non-erasable ink compositions of the present invention.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,040,356 to Kanki discloses a gravure ink made using solvent, pigment and polyurethane resin. U.S. Patent No. 6,040,356 does not disclose the solvent soluble colorants of the present invention nor is the present invention designed to be a printing ink.<br>
This invention satisfies the need for a well performing writing ink for writing instruments which does not seep or leak from the delivery end of the pen.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS As used herein, the term "homogeneous solution" means free of particles of<br>
undissolved material (e.g., polymer).<br>
As used herein, the term "thermoplastic polyurethane" is a thermoplastic<br>
polymer produced by the reaction of a polyisocyanate and a hydroxyl-containing material.<br>
A generic structure of a thermoplastic polyurethane is shown below:<br><br>
Where R and R' are alky! groups and n is an integer.<br>
As used herein, the term " isocyanate free polyurethane" is a polyurethane polymer which dees not have any free isocyanate groups for further crossbranching and crosslinking.<br>
As use herein, the term "well functioning writing ink" means an ink which writes easily without "gooping" or blobbing" and doesn't seep from the pen point.<br>
As used herein, the term '^writing performance" is known by one skilled in art to mean, for example, a reduction in amount of skipping, gooping, blobbing, blotting, bleeding and globbing as the ink is dispensed from the writing instrument and on to paper. Pens exhibiting improved writing deliver a uniform layer of ink at usual writing speeds and produce a uniform script. Measurements of writing performance have been described, for example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,099,629, 6,142,452 and 6,048,914.<br><br>
As used herein, the term "antioxidant" is an additive for inks to prevent the discoloration and changes in the viscosity of the ink with the passage of time. Examples of antioxidants are dihydroxybenzene derivatives, hydroxybenzenes, such as butylated hydroxy toluene, and hydroquinone.<br>
As used herein, the term "iridescent** refers to the result of the interference of light rays from the surface of a transparent, thin layer.<br>
As used herein, the term "phosphorescent pigment" refers to pigments that glow in the dark. Specifically, phosphorescent pigments store energy during exposure to illumination, such as daylight or UV radiation, and release the radiation as visible light when the illumination is cut off.<br>
As used herein, the term "fluorescent pigment" refers to pigments which upon exposure to light emit light energy of longer wavelengths in the visible spectrum a very short time after exposure to light. Light emitted from fluorescent pigments adds to the reflected light to give a brilliant color.<br>
As used herein, the term "about," as used in connection with one or more numbers or numerical ranges, should be understood to refer to all such numbers, including all numbers in a range.<br>
Examples of thermoplastic polyurethane resins used in present invention are the ESTANEÂ® series from the B.F.
