FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to call input in an elevator system. In particular, the present<br>
application describes a method and an apparatus for call input and wireless programming of<br>
a device.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A passenger using an elevator system has to let the control system of the elevator system<br>
know both his/her own arrival floor and the destination floor the passenger wants to reach.<br>
Traditionally, the passenger gives this call information by a two-step procedure such that,<br>
on the arrival floor the passenger first gives a landing call typically by means of arrow<br>
buttons and then, after an elevator has arrived at the customer's departure floor, the<br>
customer gives the system his/her destination floor information by pressing a car call button<br>
in a control panel in the elevator car. Due to its two-step nature, the traditional system<br>
requires the passenger to input two separate calls for one elevator ride, unless the elevator<br>
originally happens to be at the passenger's arrival floor or unless another person traveling<br>
in the same direction has input a landing call.<br>
The number of calls to be input for one elevator trip can be reduced to one by using a so-<br>
called destination call system. Such a system is widely known and a system of this type is<br>
described e.g. in US patent 3,374,864 granted already in 1968. In the destination call<br>
system, the passenger gives a destination floor call while still outside the elevator on a<br>
landing floor. On the basis of this single call, the elevator system allocates the most suitable<br>
elevator to the customer, and when the customer enters the elevator car no separate<br>
destination call needs to be given in the car.<br>
Specification US 4,655,324 describes a method and an apparatus for the input of calls to an<br>
elevator system via a wireless and portable transmitter. In this system the call is registered<br>
in the same way as if the call had been input from a traditional car control panel. The call<br>
input device has a keypad with keys that can be used to select a destination floor or give a<br><br>
special command to the elevator system. The receiver and its antenna may be placed in the<br>
car call panel if only calls given wirelessly in the elevator car are to be accepted. In the<br>
method of specification US 4,655,324, wireless input of calls from outside the car from an<br>
elevator lobby is also mentioned. Elevator users have a personal "remote controller", by<br>
means of which it is possible to give the destination floor already in the elevator lobby or<br>
while approaching the lobby. Placed in the lobby is also a receiver, which in this case<br>
transmits the call data to the elevator control system.<br>
Specification US 6,223,160 discloses a portable apparatus that can be used to input a call to<br>
an elevator system. The apparatus comprises input equipment, comprising a display and a<br>
keypad, that can be fastened e.g. to the user's wrist like a wrist watch. Included in the input<br>
equipment is an audio unit, which may comprise a microphone and a loudspeaker. The<br>
customer can input a call by vocally naming his/her destination floor, and the input<br>
equipment registers this acoustic signal. The received signal is converted into an<br>
electromagnetic signal, which can be sent by a separate transmitter. This signal can be<br>
received by a destination call terminal which is provided at the landing floor and which can<br>
also be used to input traditional destination calls in the same way as in destination control.<br>
From the destination call terminal, the call data are transferred further to the elevator<br>
control system. Over a wireless link, it is also possible to transmit information in the other<br>
direction. In this case, e.g. in elevator systems consisting of multiple elevators, the<br>
identifier (e.g. a letter code) of the elevator arriving to the customer can be shown on the<br>
display of the wrist device.<br>
A problem with prior-art solutions is mat the user interface is identical in all buildings used<br>
by the customer. Regardless of the locality where the elevator system is situated, the user<br>
has to key in the number of the destination floor via a traditional numeric keypad from zero<br>
to nine. Prior-art solutions do not use so-called single-key quick selection for selecting the<br>
destination floor because this would make the equipment dependent on the number of<br>
floors in the building. Thus, the problem with prior-art solutions is a lack of adaptability to<br>
different buildings, and this results in a low level of user friendliness of the call input<br>
equipment.<br><br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the present invention is to disclose a portable call input device and a method<br>
for wireless input of calls in an elevator system. The call input device allows building-<br>
specific quick selection and simple programming of shortcut selections.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
As for the features of the invention, reference is made to the claims.<br>
The method and system of the invention are characterized by what is disclosed in the<br>
characterization parts of claims 1 and 21. Other embodiments of the invention are<br>
characterized by what is disclosed in the other claims. Inventive embodiments are also<br>
presented in the description part and drawings of the present application. The inventive<br>
content disclosed in the application can also be defined in other ways than is done in the<br>
claims below. The inventive content may also consist of several separate inventions, especially<br>
if the invention is considered in the light of explicit or implicit sub-tasks or in respect of<br>
advantages or sets of advantages achieved. In this case, some of the attributes contained in the<br>
claims below may be superfluous from the point of view of separate inventive concepts.<br>
Within the framework of the basic concept of the invention, features of different<br>
embodiments of the invention can be applied in conjunction with other embodiments.<br>
The present invention discloses a method and an apparatus for the input of elevator calls via<br>
a portable call input device. Quick selection alternatives can be defined for the call input<br>
device, and the selection alternatives can be programmed to the device. In one embodiment,<br>
Bluetooth technology is used as the user interface of the elevator system and the call input<br>
device is the user's mobile telephone. As another embodiment, RFID technology can be<br>
utilized in the communication between the call input device and the elevator system<br>
control. One embodiment of the invention is the use of bar codes in the call input device the<br>
use of a bar code reader device connected to the system control.<br><br>
In the method of the present invention, a connection is established between the wireless<br>
terminal of the person inputting the call and the control system of the elevators. The<br>
connection can be established e.g. when the user arrives in the elevator lobby. For<br>
establishment of the connection, there are one or more base stations placed in the lobby on<br>
each floor, said base stations being connected to the control of the elevator system and used<br>
to establish a wireless connection to the terminals. The owner of the call input device is<br>
identified and after this the system control starts using a user profile concerning the user in<br>
question. Stored in the profile are e.g. the user's name, statistical information regarding the<br>
destination floors most frequently selected by the user on the departure floor and in the<br>
building in question, and data indicating activated additional services. The profile also<br>
takes into account the building (number of floors and floor name information ) where the<br>
user is.<br>
In an embodiment, the names of the quick selection alternatives are transmitted to the call<br>
input device. These preselections can be defined as the user's most favored destination<br>
floor selections considered from the departure floor in question. The preselection<br>
alternatives are given specifically for each building and they can be assigned illustrative<br>
designations on the display of the call input device.<br>
The user can give his/her destination floor selection in the elevator lobby already before<br>
coming to the vicinity of the elevator. The destination floor selection is combined with the<br>
departure floor data obtained from the location of the terminal and this pair of call data<br>
items is transmitted to the elevator control system for elevator allocation.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the call is input by briefly depressing a button<br>
on the terminal. The programming of a new destination floor as a quick selection<br>
alternative on the call input device is effected by depressing a desired quick selection<br>
button by a long depression when the user is on the desired destination floor. Alternatively,<br>
the programming can also be effected elsewhere than in the building whose floors are being<br>
programmed. In this case, the identifier of the building has been sent previously to the<br><br>
terminal in a situation where the terminal was situated in the building in question. By using<br>
the identifier, the quick selection buttons can be programmed independently of the place of<br>
programming.<br>
Once the call has been processed and an elevator has been allocated to serve it, information<br>
regarding the elevator to serve the call is transmitted to the display of the user's terminal.<br>
This information can be combined with information guiding the user to the elevator in the<br>
case of large elevator lobbies, and in addition an estimated waiting time can be<br>
communicated to the user. In the user profile, it is possible to activate additional services,<br>
such as e.g. a handicapped user service for handicapped persons.<br>
In an embodiment utilizing RFID technology, the call can be input by closing the desired<br>
one of a number of resonant circuits by means of a bubble switch. In this way, the resonant<br>
circuit acts as a transponder while the RFID transmitter connected to the system control<br>
functions as a reader device.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the call input device may be a card-type device<br>
with a number of bar codes. In this case, the reader device of the system is a bar code<br>
reader. A call is input by showing the desired code to an optical reader while covering the<br>
other codes visible on the card.<br>
In the present invention, Bluetooth technology can be utilized by providing to the user<br>
many services related to the use of elevators. This becomes possible by connecting both the<br>
control system and the call input device to a network providing services, e.g. to the Internet.<br>
Via the Internet, the elevator control and call system can communicate with other functions<br>
available in the building.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention discloses a method and an apparatus for the input of a call in elevator<br>
system by means of a portable call input device. An example of the call input device is a<br>
mobile telephone, but it is also possible to use as a call input device e.g. a portable device<br>
specially designed for this purpose. The size of the call input device is approximately of the<br>
order of the size of existing mobile telephones.<br>
Fig. 1 presents an example of a call input device, which in this case is the elevator<br>
passenger's mobile telephone. Essential parts comprised in the call input device are a<br>
keypad 10 and a display 11. The keypad 10 of the mobile telephone serves as quick<br>
selection buttons of the call input device. A call input device of a different type may contain<br>
a desired number of quick selection buttons instead of the conventional numeric telephone<br>
keypad, and the destination floors most frequently used by the user are programmed to the<br>
buttons. The programmed floors can be set e.g. in a building-specific manner, so for<br>
example an 'Exit' button may stand for a different floor in different buildings. The quick<br>
selection buttons can be programmed in a simple way, which will be described in more<br>
detail later on.<br>
An example of the call input equipment for an elevator system according to the present<br>
invention is presented in Fig. 2. The passenger using the elevator system of the building in<br>
question possesses a portable call input device 20, which in a preferred embodiment is a<br>
mobile telephone. Each floor in the building is provided with a base station 21, which can<br>
communicate with the call input device 20. The antenna of the base station 21 is so placed<br><br>
and oriented that it can receive the signal sent by the call input device 20 from those areas<br>
in the elevator lobby where customers typically move when arriving to the elevator.<br>
Essential components of the call input device 20 are a display, programmable quick<br>
selection buttons and a transmitter-receiver unit, of which the last-mentioned component<br>
may be e.g. an infrared transmitter-receiver or a radio transmitter-receiver. The base station<br>
21 correspondingly contains a transmitter-receiver capable of communicating with a<br>
plurality of call input devices so that it is able to handle signals sent simultaneously by<br>
several call input devices.<br>
The base station 21 is connected to the elevator control system 22, which contains a<br>
processor that performs the allocation of elevators. The base station 21 processes the<br>
received call data into a form that the control system 22 is able to understand. The system<br>
additionally also comprises up-down call buttons 23 as are normally used for the input of<br>
traditional landing calls, and car call buttons inside the elevator car. The system may also<br>
be provided with e.g. a so-called destination call system, where the passenger can use a so-<br>
called DOP (Destination Operating Panel) to give a destination floor call already on the<br>
landing before entering the car. Those passengers who have a portable call input device 20<br>
use it for call input. Other passengers give a landing call in the traditional manner by<br>
pressing the up-down call buttons 23 and a car call via the car call panel.<br>
When an elevator customer carrying a call input device 20 presses a call button, the call<br>
input device 20 and the base station 21 establish a connection permitting two-way data<br>
transfer. Each base station 21 on a floor in the building knows the name information<br>
designating the building where the base station is situated, as well as the floor on which it is<br>
located. When the passenger gives a call by pressing a quick selection button (e.g. an 'Exit'<br>
button), a communication cycle is started between the call input device 20 and the base<br>
station 21. In a preferred embodiment, during this communication cycle started by the call<br>
input device 20,<br>
- the base station 21 tells the call input device 20 the building name and floor identifier for<br>
the building and floor where the call input device 20 is located at the moment<br><br>
-	the selection alternatives behind the quick selection buttons of the call input device 20 are<br>
replaced with the destination floor selection alternatives for this particular building, which<br>
have been previously programmed by the user<br>
-	when the quick selection button is released after a short depression, the call input device 20<br>
sends to the base station 21 the destination floor data corresponding to the button and in<br>
response to the call input the call input device 20 can give the user a short sound signal,<br>
-	the base station 21 combines the destination floor data with data indicating the floor of its<br>
own location, i.e. the floor from which the call was issued<br>
-	the base station 21 transmits the pair of call data items 'call input floor, destination floor' to<br>
the elevator control system 22.<br>
After the control system 22 has made a decision regarding the elevator to serve the call and<br>
transmitted this information to the base station 21, a second communication cycle, started<br>
by the base station 21, begins, during which<br>
-	the call input device 20 having sent the call receives information regarding the elevator 24<br>
serving the call.<br>
The call input device 20 can give a sound signal and display the number or other code<br>
identifying the elevator 24 serving the call. In buildings containing several elevators, this<br>
allows the user to move beforehand to the right elevator and wait in front of it. The elevator<br>
24 to serve the call can also be indicated using traditional light indicators 25 above or<br>
beside the elevator door to indicate the elevator having arrived and its direction of<br>
departure. When the elevator customer boards the elevator 24, the destination floor call has<br>
already been input (the light indicator for the desired destination floor is lit), so the<br>
customer need not give a new call in the elevator car. In this sense the present invention is<br>
like a remotely operated destination call system. At this juncture, the base station 21 can<br>
transmit useful information, such as an estimated elevator waiting time, to the display of<br>
the customer's call input device 20.<br><br>
In the programming of the quick selection buttons of the call input device 20, indirect use is<br>
made of the user interface used for call input in the elevator system. When the customer<br>
wishes to program a new destination floor in a given building for a quick selection button,<br>
he/she will normally ride on an elevator to the destination floor in question using the call<br>
input device. Having reached the destination floor, the user presses the desired quick<br>
selection button by a long depression. This depression starts a communication cycle<br>
between the base station 21 and the call input device 20, wherein<br>
the base station 21 sends the call input device 20 information giving the building name and<br>
floor data for the building and floor where the call input device 20 is located at the moment<br>
-	the information behind the quick selection buttons of the call input device 20 is replaced<br>
with the information regarding the destination floors in the building in question, which<br>
have been previously programmed by the user<br>
-	when me quick selection button is released after a long depression, the floor data received<br>
from the base station 21 is stored on the relevant quick selection button of the call input<br>
device 20.<br>
In this case, no call is sent from the call input device 20 to the base station 21. It is to be<br>
noted tiiat the stored destination floor data is building-specific. Thus, destination floors<br>
stored in building A have no effect on destination floor alternatives stored by the customer<br>
in building B. After the information has been stored, a destination floor dius stored can be<br>
selected in the manner described above.<br>
The destination floor alternatives can also be programmed in anotiier way. In tiiis example the programming can also be carried out elsewhere than in the building whose floors are<br>
being programmed. First, the holder of the call input device 20 must visit the building<br>
which is to be programmed later. In tiiis situation, when the call input device 20 is located<br>
witiiin the range of a base station 21, the call input device 20 receives via the base station<br>
21 the building identification data from the system control 22. In addition to diis<br>
unambiguous identification data, it is also possible to transmit other information<br>
specifically relating to the building, such as information regarding the number of floors in<br><br>
the building and possible special floor designations. When the holder of the call input<br>
device wishes to program desired destination floor alternatives in a desired building, he/she<br>
can do this outside the building, e.g. at home. In this case, the programmed information is<br>
stored on the call input device 20, and thus no connection to the base station 21 is needed.<br>
Via the user interface of the call input device 20, the user selects the identification data<br>
(which may consist of e.g. the name of the building) on the basis of which is selected the<br>
building for which the programming is to be performed. During the actual programming,<br>
the user interface asks the user to give the shortcut key to be programmed and the<br>
destination floor to be programmed and returns feedback telling whether the programming<br>
in the memory of the call input device 20 was successful. The programming can be<br>
repeated until all desired preselection alternatives have been stored on the call input device<br>
20. After this, destination floor calls are input as above, by pressing a quick selection<br>
button in the building in question.<br>
An example of the present invention involves the use of RFID technology. A RFID system<br>
typically comprises a reader device and several transponders, i.e. identification signals.<br>
When a transponder arrives wiuiin the field transmitted by the reader device, the transponder sends the information stored on it to the reader device.<br>
In an elevator system, RFID technology can be used by placing a reader device in the<br>
elevator lobby. The elevator user again has a call input device. In this embodiment<br>
example, the call input device used is an access card, which contains two or more RFID<br>
resonant circuits. Each RFID resonant circuit contains a switch that can be used to close the current circuit. When the resonant circuit is closed, the circuit works like a RFID<br>
transponder. In a preferred embodiment, the access card contains four RFTD resonant<br>
circuits and four bubble switches integrated in it, and the desired resonant circuit can be<br>
selected by pressing the relevant switch. For each bubble switch, the user can program<br>
desired destination floors as described above. When walking past a remote reader, the user<br>
presses the bubble switch corresponding to the desired destination floor, and in diis way the<br>
destination call is transmitted to the elevator control system.<br><br>
The card can be provided with a personal identifier, which is transmitted to the elevator<br>
control system together with the call data. This allows the use of special functions; for<br>
example, in the case of a handicapped customer the elevator door can be held open for a<br>
somewhat longer time than usual. An application related to personal identification is<br>
identification of a priority call. Access to a given floor can be allowed only to desired<br>
persons. One possibility is to provide faster elevator service to priority customers than to<br>
others, in other words, a priority customer's call is served first regardless of other active<br>
calls.<br>
In the case of an access card provided with bubble switches used in a low-rise building,<br>
each floor can be set behind a separate switch. In higher buildings, it is naturally necessary<br>
to follow the above-described procedure, by having the most favored destination floors<br>
programmed beforehand on the card e.g. by the elevator passenger or the operator of the<br>
elevator system.<br>
An example of the present invention is the use of bar codes to implement the call card. In<br>
this embodiment, the card can be provided with four bar codes, with two bar codes placed<br>
on either side of the card. In this embodiment example the remote reader is a bar code<br>
reader like those used e.g. with cash machines in grocery stores. The call card can be used<br>
so that the customer arriving to the elevator shows the card to the reader while covering<br>
with his/her hand one of the bar codes on the same side of the card. Such a card contains<br>
four different floor selection alternatives, but it is also possible to place more bar codes on<br>
each side of the card. On the other hand, the number of different bar codes that can be<br>
placed on one card without impairing its usability can be influenced by the design of the<br>
card.<br>
The card according to the embodiment example may be a building-specific or a general-<br>
purpose card. In the case of a general-purpose card, the floors have to be programmed e.g.<br>
in such a way that a given bubble switch or bar code always stands for that floor to which<br>
the user arriving in the building is going (e.g. the floor on which the user is living, or the<br>
floor on which the workroom at the job is located) and similarly another bubble switch or<br><br>
bar code always means the exit floor or lobby floor of the building. As the number of<br>
bubble switches in the present invention may be other than two or four, the programming<br>
can also be performed in some other appropriate way.<br>
An example of the present invention is to utilize the so-called Bluetooth technology.<br>
Bluetooth is a standard that deals with local wireless data transfer in a mobile telephone<br>
environment. The standard is based on low-cost and short-range wireless connections. In<br>
Bluetooth technology, many wireless and wired devices of different types can be connected<br>
to each other via a wireless link. The radio frequency band used is 2.4 - 2.4835 GHz, which<br>
is an unlicensed frequency range intended for ISM applications. The transmitter-receiver<br>
uses frequency hopping, which reduces the effect of disturbances. The maximum hopping<br>
rate may be 1600 hops per second, and the number of different frequency channels is 79,<br>
spaced at 1 MHz between channels. Data transfer is packet-based and typically the<br>
transmitter changes the transmitting frequency after the transmission of each packet. The<br>
transmission power is typically 1 mW, which allows a 10 m link distance between<br>
transmitter and receiver. However, the transmission power can be increased up to 100 mW,<br>
which allows a link distance of even 100 m. Bluetooth supports asynchronous data transfer,<br>
where the data transfer rate in one direction is 721 kb/s while the data transfer rate in the<br>
return direction is 57.6 kb/s.<br>
Piconet means a link and network consistent with Bluetooth technology, created for<br>
temporary use between different devices. A piconet may typically consist of e.g. a mobile<br>
telephone and a PC. In a piconet, one device is called a master, to which the other devices<br>
(slaves) are subordinated. The clock signal controlling the system is obtained e.g. from the<br>
master device. Several piconet networks can be connected together, and these networks can<br>
be distinguished by the fact that each network has its own frequency hopping sequence.<br>
Bluetooth is an open standard, so it enables applications created by a third party, which can<br>
be successfully utilized in a Bluetooth system. The call system of the present invention is<br>
such an application. Bluetooth technology makes it possible for a mobile telephone within<br><br>
the area of the network to know its location, and this feature can be utilized to provide to<br>
the user of the mobile telephone services available in this area.<br>
As an embodiment of the present invention, the elevator system can be equipped with<br>
Bluetooth radio units and each user of the elevator system can be offered a personal<br>
interface for the input of elevator calls. Service is improved, and Bluetooth also gives a<br>
possibility to bill the customer for this improved service. Bluetooth enables wireless input<br>
of calls via a mobile telephone as described above as well as building-specific<br>
programming of calls.<br>
An example of a solution according to the present invention utilizing Bluetootfi technology<br>
is presented in Fig. 3. A passenger carrying his/her own mobile telephone 30 arrives in the<br>
elevator lobby, where several such telephones may be present at the same time. Each floor<br>
served by the elevators is provided with a low-power RF unit 31 enabling data transfer<br>
between the elevator system and the mobile telephone 30. The passenger can download a<br>
user interface application from the elevator manufacturer's server 33 via the Internet 32.<br>
After being registered as a user of the interface, the customer's mobile telephone is able to<br>
establish a connection to the elevator group control system 34. During the downloading and<br>
registering process, the user is asked for identification information and the user is given a<br>
username, which will be used subsequently to identify the user. In principle it is also<br>
possible to bill the user of the service for the registration. Once the user has his/her own<br>
username, he/she can create a personal user profile on the server 33 and also change the<br>
profile later. In the profile it is possible to activate various services. As an example, a<br>
handicapped person can be provided a service for handicapped passengers whereby a call<br>
given by the user is treated in the control system as a special call. A special call can be<br>
afforded faster than normal service, or elevator allocation can be effected taking into<br>
account that a passenger in a wheel chair needs more space in the elevator car. The system<br>
gives a possibility to grant the username for a defined period, i.e. the username may be<br>
valid for a period of desired length.<br><br>
Thus, a registered user is able to input calls via his/her mobile telephone 30. Each elevator<br>
group has a separate identifier. The identifier makes it possible to know the elevator group<br>
in whose area the customer is moving. The floor can be determined on the basis of the floor<br>
to whose Piconet network the mobile telephone 30 is linked. The RF unit 31 and the mobile<br>
telephones 30 located on the same floor form a Piconet network, which is connected to a<br>
computer 34 responsible for group control of the elevator system. The connection from the<br>
RF unit 31 to the control computer 34 can be arranged e.g. via a USB bus or a serial port. In<br>
large lobbies it is useful to mount several RF units 31 to allow the location of the customer<br>
to be known with a rough accuracy. This location data can be utilized to guide the customer<br>
to the right elevator 36.<br>
The passenger gives his/her destination floor in the elevator lobby using the keypad of<br>
his/her mobile telephone 30 and application software produced by the elevator<br>
manufacturer or some other party. As the departure floor is identified by the Piconet<br>
network to which the mobile telephone 30 is linked, the source floor - target floor pair is<br>
known, on the basis of which it is possible to perform elevator allocation and thus select the<br>
best elevator for the customer. Information regarding the arriving elevator and its location<br>
in large lobbies relative to the passenger as well as an estimated waiting time can be<br>
presented on the display of the mobile telephone 30. The information transmitted may be<br>
e.g. as shown on display 11. When the elevator arrives at the floor, in addition to the<br>
normal signal lights 37 (arrow lights e.g. above or beside the elevator door 36), the<br>
passenger can be given e.g. a sound signal or other signaling via the mobile telephone 30.<br>
The system also comprises up-down call buttons 38, which are needed for passengers not<br>
registered in the call system.<br>
If the passenger is a regular user of the elevators in the building, i.e. a so-called long-<br>
standing customer, then it is possible to give to the user's mobile telephone as a default<br>
alternative the destination floor most frequently selected by the user from the floor in<br>
question. In this case, by just pressing a button, the user can accept or reject the default<br>
destination floor given.<br><br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, in an office building with many companies it is<br>
possible to present on the display of the mobile telephone a list of all the companies<br>
working in the building. The elevator user can select from this list the target company<br>
he/she is going to. Having received the call data and allocated an elevator, the control<br>
system can send over the Internet 32 information regarding the identity of the guest or<br>
worker to the receptionist of the company concerned. This gives the possibility that,<br>
depending on the waiting and ride time of the arriving customer, the company can have<br>
people waiting e.g. for an arriving guest in their lobby somewhat beforehand. This<br>
application requires that the company in question has bought from the maintainer of the<br>
elevator system a right to use the service. In practice, this right can be acquired by<br>
registering to the web server 33 on the same principle as the elevator customer was<br>
registered as a user.<br>
The elevator cars can also be provided with RF units. This makes it possible to send to the<br>
elevator customers' mobile telephones individual information about the destination e.g. in<br>
the form of guidance. In principle, the present Bluetooth technology also allows the<br>
transmission of advertisements to the mobile telephone.<br>
As an embodiment, individual and personal passenger guidance can be implemented in<br>
high-rise buildings, which may contain several separate elevator systems. Guidance is<br>
required if the customer has to transfer from one elevator group to another during his/her<br>
trip. When the customer arrives to the area of a new Piconet network after an elevator trip,<br>
he/she will be located and the customer can be guided personally forward towards the next<br>
elevator group and the elevator allocated to the passenger. A call for an elevator providing a<br>
continuation connection can be made automatically when the system detects the arrival of<br>
the customer in the area of the next elevator group.<br>
The computer 34 controlling the system can be connected to the Internet 32 by linking an<br>
embedded mobile telephone 35 to the computer. By means of this mobile telephone, the<br>
elevator control system can communicate with other functions in the building. Connected to<br>
the processors controlling the functions are mobile telephones which again can be used to<br><br>
establish a connection to the Internet 32, over which the various functions can transmit data<br>
to each other. Thus, the user of the elevator system can be provided diversified services, in<br>
which it is possible to utilize the customer location data given by a short range Piconet<br>
network (using a radio transmitter-receiver typically with an operating range of 10 m).<br>
It is obvious to the person skilled in the art that the invention is not limited to the<br>
embodiments described above, in which the invention has been described by way of<br>
