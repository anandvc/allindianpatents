PROTOCHROMIC PRIMER COMPOSITION HAVING HIGH IMPACT<br>
RESISTANCE AND TRANSPARENT MATERIAL COATED WITH THE SAME<br>
Technical Field<br>
5 The present invention relates to a primer composition<br>
having photochromic property and impact resistance for<br>
coating transparent materials end to a photochromic<br>
transparent material having a primer layer formed by coating<br>
and curing the primer composition.<br>
10<br>
Background Art<br>
The  primer  composition  for  coating   transparent<br>
materials according to the present invention is applied to<br>
various transparent materials requiring transparency such as<br>
15  lenses for glasses, glass for cars, optical lenses, optical<br>
films, etc. Raw materials for transparent materials include<br>
plastics and glass. Among these, plastic lenses have strong<br>
breaking resistance and a lighter weight compared to glass<br>
and thus are largely used as substitutes for transparent<br>
20  glass. Particularly, plastic lenses are widely used in the<br>
field of optical lenses or lenses for glasses.<br>
Materials  for  transparent  plastic  lenses  include<br>
polyallylcarbonate, acrylic resin or polythiourethane. Such<br>
materials for transparent plastic lenses have soft surfaces<br>
25  and  tend to be  cracked  or  scratched.  Therefore,  such<br>
materials have a need of surface reinforcement, for example,<br>
by a silicone-based hard coating. However, a silicone-based<br>
hard coating is problematic in that it decreases impact<br>
resistance of a plastic lens. Accordingly,  in order to<br>
30  prevent such a problem, it is necessary to coat a primer<br>

WO 2005/014739                                                                                                               PCT/KR2004/001976<br><br>
Layer between a plastic lens and a hard coating layer.<br>
Japanese  Laid-Open Publication  No.   H8-54501  discloses a<br>
method   for   improving   impact   resistance  of   a   plastic    lens,<br>
wherein   a   layer  formed  of   urethane-based   resin   is   used   as   a<br>
5      primer  layer.<br>
Meanwhile,   use   of a   photochromic   compound  as   a   primer<br>
layer    has    been    disclosed    in    the    prior    art.     For    example,<br>
Japanese    Laid-Open    Publication     No.     H3-269507    discloses     a<br>
photochromic    lens    comprising    a    plastic    substrate,     a    hard<br>
10      coating   layer   formed   of   silicone   resin   and   a   primer   layer<br>
between the plastic substrate and the hard coating layer,   the<br>
primer     Layer     containing      a     photochromic     substance.      In<br>
addition,      use     of     photochromic      coating     composition      is<br>
disclosed   in   several   patent   publications   including   Japanese<br>
15      Laid-Open     Publication     No.      H5-28753     and     US     Patent     Nos.<br>
4,889,413,     6,107,396,     6,187,444,      6,268,055,     6,060,001     and<br>
6,436,525.<br>
However,  when  a  photochromic  dye  combined  with<br>
polyurethane is coated on a plastic substrate as a primer<br>
20  coating layer, there are problems in that the optical density<br>
is low and the bleaching rate is also low. Additionally, when<br>
the thickness of a primer layer is increased to 10 µm or more<br>
so as to obtain a high optical density, the hardness of a<br>
hard coating layer is decreased after applying the hard<br>
25  coating layer.<br>
Generally, important factors to evaluate a photochromic<br>
lens are a high activation/bleaching rate, a high optical<br>
density (OD) and fatigue resistance. Among these factors,<br>
fatigue resistance can be improved by the selection of a<br>
30  suitable matrix and the addition of a UV stabilizer, etc.<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2005/014739                                                                                                               PCT/KR2004/001976<br>
Therefore, it is necessary to increase the optical density of<br>
a lens while maintaining a desired activation/bleaching rate.<br>
Particularly, it is an imminent subject in the field of<br>
photochromic primer coatings to improve the optical density.<br>
5  The most important factors determining the optical density of<br>
an organic photochromic dye are a structure of the dye itself<br>
and environments of the dye. However, these factors have not<br>
been   considered   heretofore   in   photochromic   primer<br>
compositions according to the prior art.<br>
10<br>
Disclosure of the Invention.<br>
The  present  inventors  have  found  that  when  a<br>
photochromic dye is used to apply a photochromic primer<br>
coating layer on a transparent plastic material,  a high<br>
15  optical density can be obtained even at a small coating layer<br>
thickness if the environment of the dye is polar. Because the<br>
polarity of environments of the dye increases, the activated<br>
dye molecules are more stabilized. Additionally, they have<br>
found that as a free volume present in constitutional<br>
20  elements  of  a primer composition  increases,  reversible<br>
activation/bleaching of a photochromic dye is facilitated and<br>
thus the activation/bleaching rate increases.<br>
Therefore, the present invention has been made based on<br>
these findings. It is an object of the present invention to<br>
25  provide  a  primer  composition  for  coating  transparent<br>
materials and a transparent material having a primer layer<br>
formed by coating and curing the primer composition, wherein<br>
the primer composition comprises a polyurethane containing a<br>
Brønsted salt, a polyepoxy resin and a photochromic dye.<br>
30       According to an aspect of the present invention, there<br>

WO 2005/014739                                                                                                              PCT/KR2004/001976<br>
is provided a printer composition for coating transparent<br>
materials, comprising: (a) 5-90 parts by weight of a<br>
polyurethane containing a Brønsted salt; (b) 5-50 parts by<br>
weight of a polyepoxy resin; and (c) 1-40 parts by weight of<br>
5 a photochromic dye, based on 100 parts by weight of the total<br>
primer composition.<br>
According   to  another   aspect   of  the   present   invention,<br>
there   is  provided  a  photochromic  transparent  material  having<br>
a   primer    layer   formed   by    coating   and    curing    the    above-<br>
10      described     primer     composition      on      the      surface      of      the<br>
transparent material.<br>
The foregoing and other objects, features and<br>
advantages of the present invention will be explained in<br>
detail hereinafter.<br>
15               In    the   primer   composition    according    to    the    present<br>
invention, the first component, i.e., the polyurethane is<br>
characterized by containing a Brønsted salt and thus having<br>
polarity. The BRønsted salt provides the photochromic dye<br>
contained in the printer layer formed by the printer<br>
20      composition with polar environment.<br>
Such     effect     may     be     explained     as      follows:     most<br>
photochromic dyes  such as merocyanine may be transformed  into<br>
an   activated  state   having   a   zwitterion  by   a   cleavage   of  a<br>
certain   chemical  bond  in   the   original  structure   of   the  dye,<br>
35      when    exposed   to    DV,    etc.     By    virtue    of    the    polyurethane<br>
containing   a   Brønsted   salt,    the   activated   photochromic   dye<br>
can     be     provided     with     polar     environment.      When     UV     is<br>
irradiated,      such     polar      environment      can      stabilize     the<br>
activated   dye   and   can   minimize    the   progress    of   a   reverse<br>
30      reaction      so     that     a     strongly     activated     state     can     be<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2005/014739                                                                                                               PCT/KR2004/001976<br>
maintained. Therefore, even if the photochromic primer<br>
coating layer has a small thickness, a high optical density<br>
can be accomplished.<br>
According  to  the  present   invention,   the   Brønsted   salt<br>
5      in    the   polyurethane   may   be   provided   by   a   reaction   product<br>
between   an   aminodiol   and   a   Brønsted   acid.    Such   a   Brønsted<br>
salt   formed  of   an  anionic  conjugate  base   of   a  Brønsted  acid<br>
and a  cationic amine  stabilizes  an activated photochromic dye<br>
having   zwitterions   so   that    a    high   optical   density   can   be<br>
10       obtained.<br>
Other  physical  properties  of  polyurethane  are<br>
determined by characteristics of a polyol and an isocyanate<br>
used in the preparation of the polyurethane. Particularly,<br>
physical properties of polyurethane may be determined by<br>
15  controlling the ratio of a hard segment to a soft segment in<br>
the polyurethane through the kind and amount of the polyol.<br>
The soft segment of polyurethane is produced by the reaction<br>
of an isocyanate and a high molecular weight polyol such as a<br>
polyester polyol or polyether polyol.  The  soft segment<br>
20  provides the photochromic dye with a free space required to<br>
perform a reversible reaction and provides a transparent<br>
material to which the primer composition according to the<br>
present invention is applied with impact resistance. The hard<br>
segment of polyurethane is produced by the reaction between<br>
25  an isocyanate with a low molecular weight polyol. The hard<br>
segment improves mechanical strength, neat resistance and<br>
chemical resistance of a coating layer formed by the primer<br>
composition according to the present invention.<br>

polyester   functional   group.    Estane   5778   can   disperse   metal<br>
5      oxides,  pigments,   etc.,   stably and  has a  high  solubility to a<br>
solvent     such     as     methylethyl      ketone,      dimethylformamide,<br>

used     in     the     manufacture     of      recording     media     such     as<br>
videotapes,   audiotapes,   etc.<br>
10                Since the polyurethane  containing a Brønsted salt  is a<br>
reaction product of art isocyanate with a polyol, the primer<br>
composition of the present invention may include a<br>
polyurethane reaction mixture (reaction mixture for preparing<br>
polyurethane) comprising an isocyanate and a polyol, instead<br>
15      of the polyurethane.<br>

20      isocyanate      or       a      blocked       alicyclic       isocyanate.       More<br>
particularly,   preferred   examples   of   the   isocyanate   component<br>
include    diisocyanates    such    as     hexamethylene    diisocyanate,<br>

25      dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate,   etc.<br>
Preferably,   the  polyol   used  in the preparation  of  the<br>
polyurethane containing a  Brønsted salt  includes:    (i)   a  diol<br>
containing  a   Brønsted  salt,     (ii)    a  polyol   generating  a   soft<br>

The diol (i) containing a Brønsted salt may be a<br>
reaction product of an aminodiol with a Brønsted acid. The<br>
aminodiol may be prepared by conventional methods well known<br>
to persons skilled in the art. Particular examples of the<br>
5 aminodiol include 2-amino-2-methyl-1,3-propanediol, N-(n-<br>

phenyldiethanolamine,                    diethyl                   N,N-bis(2-<br>
hydroxyethyl) aminomethyl phosphonate,   etc.<br>
10               The  Brønsted  acid  to  be   reacted  with  the  aminodiol may<br>

thereto.<br>
Non-limitative examples of the polyol   (ii)   generating a<br>
soft     segment    of     polyurethane     include     a     polyesterdiol,<br>
polyetherdiol,   polyacrylic   diol   and polycarbonate  diol.   When<br>
25     the polyol   (ii)   has a molecular weight  less than  300  g/mole,<br>
impact   resistance   and   optical   density   may   be   decreased.   On<br>
the  other hand,   when  the  polyol    (ii)   has   a molecular  weight<br>
exceeding    6,000    g/mole,     coatability    may    be    deteriorated.<br>

molecular  weight  of  50  to  500  g/mole.   Examples  of  the  polyol<br>
(iii)      may      include.     1,4-butanediol,       1,2-butanediol,      1,5-<br>
pentanediol,   2, 4-pentanediol,   l,4-cyclohexanediol,   1,6-<br>
hexanediol, 2,5-hexanediol, 2,4-haptanediol, pentaerythritol<br>
10  and trimethylolpropane, but are not limited thereto. Further,<br>
the amount of the polyol (iii) is preferably 1-50 parts by<br>
weight and more preferably 5-30 parts by weight, based on 100<br>
parts by weight of the polyurethane.<br>
According to the present invention, a catalyst may be<br>
15  used for preparing the polyurethane containing a Brønsted<br>
salt. Such catalysts include a Lewis base, a Lewis acid or an<br>
insertion reaction catalyst well known to persons skilled in<br>
the art, etc. Particular examples of the catalyst may include<br>
tin octylate, dibutyltin diacetate, dibutyltin dilaurate,<br>
20  dibutyltin  mercaptide,  dibutyltin  dimaleate,  dimethyltin<br>
hydroxide, triethylamine, etc., but are not limited thereto.<br>
Preferably,  the Brønsted salt  in  the polyurethane<br>
exists in the ratio of 10 to 100 gram equivalents per 1x106 g<br>
of polyurethane. Although the Brønsted salt exists in such a<br>
25  small amount, it provides polar environment to a photochromic<br>
dye so that optical density can be improved.<br>
In  the polyurethane  containing  a  Brønsted  salt,<br>
isocyanate and polyol are present in such an amount that the<br>
mole ratio between tooth functional groups of NCO and OH,<br>
30  i.e., NCO/OH ranges preferably from 0.5 to 3.0 and more<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2005/014739                                                                                                              PCT/KR2004/001976<br><br>
preferably from 0.75 to 2.0. If the mole ratio is less than<br>
0.5, the coating layer formed by the primer coating<br>
composition cannot be cured sufficiently. On the other hand,<br>
if the mole ratio between both functional groups is more than<br>
5 3.0, unreacted isocyanate may exist and thus have possibility<br>
to react with an upper hard coating layer, thereby detracting<br>
from the performance and appearance of the hard coating<br>
layer.<br>
The  amount  of  the  polyurethane  reaction  mixture<br>
10  containing an isocyanate with a polyol or the polyurethane is<br>
preferably 5 to 90 parts by weight based on 100 parts by<br>
weight of the total primer composition. If the amount is less<br>
than 5 parts by weight, impact resistance and optical density<br>
may be decreased, while the amount is more than 90 parts by<br>
15  weight,  activation/bleaching rate becomes low and adhesive<br>
property may be decreased.<br>
According to the primer composition of the present<br>
invention, it is preferable that the second component, i.e.,<br>
the polyepoxy resin is linear and has a molecular weight of<br>
20  about 300-2,000 g/mole. Epoxy groups in the epoxy resin can<br>
react  with hydroxy groups  present  in  the  polyurethane<br>
reaction mixture or polyurethane. This results in ring-<br>
opening of epoxy groups simultaneously with the generation of<br>
view OH groups, which in turn can react with NCO groups<br>
25  present in the isocyanate to form urethane bonds that may<br>
become a part of the polyurethane. Additionally, unreacted<br>
epoxy groups may react with OH groups present in an upper<br>
hard coating layer so that the primer layer can be in close<br>
contact with the hard coating layer. Further, use of the<br>
30  polyepoxy component result in the formation of an additional<br>

WO 2005/014739                                                                                                               PCT/KR2004/001976<br><br>
free space in the primer layer formed by the primer<br>
composition according to the present invention. Therefore,<br>
the chemical structural change of a photochromic dye may be<br>
facilitated and thus activation/bleaching rate may be<br>
5      increased.<br>
Preferably, the amount of the polyepoxy resin is 5 to<br>
50 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the total<br>
primer composition. If the amount is less than 5 parts by<br>
weight, adhesive property becomes poor, while if the amount<br>
10 is more than 50 parts by weight, coatability may be<br>
decreased.<br>
Examples of the polyepoxy resin that may be used in the<br>
present   invention   include   bispheriol   A   epoxy   of   Lucky   Epoxy<br>
Resin,    available   from   LG   Chem.,    Ltd.,    polysulifido-modified<br>
15      epoxy   resin  Flep  available   from  Toray  Thiokol   Corp.,   or   the<br>
like.     For    example,     polyepoxy    resin     LER-840,     which    is    a<br>
typical   example   for   the   bisphenol   A   epoxy   of   Lucky   Epoxy<br>
Resin,   is   a  polyepoxy  resin  having  two  epoxy  groups at both<br>
ends  and comprising bisphenol A as a  basic  structure.   It  has<br>
20      an epoxy  equivalent  of  180-190  and a  viscosity  of   9000-11000<br>
cps   at   25ºC.   It  also  has   excellent   adhesive   properties,   low<br>
shrinkage,    high   chemical    resistance    and    other    advantages.<br>
Further,   because  it  has  a   relatively   long   chain  and a  large<br>
molecular weight,   it  can form an additional  free  space in the<br>
25      structure     of     a     primer     layer.     Therefore,      it     causes     a<br>
photochromic dye to be  easily  changed in  chemical   structure,<br>
thereby    increasing    activation/bleaching     rate     and    optical<br>
density.<br>
According     to     the     present     composition,      the     third<br>
30      component    for   providing   photochromic    property   may   be    any<br>

photochromic dyes with no particular limitation. For example,<br>
benzopyran-, naphthopyran-, phenanthropyran-,<br>
indenonaphthopyran-,- fulgide, spirooxazine-, and spiropyran-<br>
based compounds may be used. One primer composition according<br>
5 to the present invention may include various photochromic<br>
dyes so as to exhibit various colors.<br>
The amount of the photochromic dye is preferably 1 to<br>
40 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the total<br>
primer composition. If the amount is less than 1 part by<br>
10 weight, optical density is low, while if the amount is more<br>
than 40 parts by weight, coatability is poor.<br>
The primer composition according to the present<br>
invention may dissolve in an organic solvent to apply on a<br>
transparent material. Organic solvents that may be used in<br>
15 the present invention include alcohols, ketones, esters and<br>
ethers. More particularly, methylethyl ketone, acetylacetone,<br>
ethylcellosolve acetate, diacetone alcohol, ethyl acetate,<br>
etc., are preferably used.<br>
The  primer  composition  according  to  the  present<br>
20  invention  may  be  coated  on  a  transparent  material,<br>
particularly on a plastic lens, atc. More particularly, the<br>
primer composition according to the present invention may be<br>
applied  to  materials  including  polycarbonates,  acrylic<br>
resins, polydiethylene glycolbisallyl carbonate(CR-39)  and<br>
25  polyethylene terephthalate. The primer composition according<br>
to the present invention has excellent adhesion force to the<br>
above-described materials  and photochromic property with<br>
which it is activated in the outdoor environment and is<br>
bleached in the indoor environment. In order to provide a<br>

lens with a higher optical density and improved fatigue<br>
resistance when the lens is exposed to UV light, it is<br>
important to select a suitable matrix. Also, various<br>
additives (for example, a UV stabilizer such as Tinuvin<br>
5 available from Ciba-Geigy Japan Corp., a surfactant, etc.)<br>
may be added to  the matrix.<br>
Preferably,     the   primer   composition    according    to    the<br>
present   invention   is   coated  on.  a   plastic  lens  by  a   suitable<br>
method   including   a   dipping   method,    a   spin   coating   method,<br>
10      etc.,   and then  is  cured at   50-150ºC for 0.5-4 hours.   In order<br>
to   prevent   the   deterioration   and   deformation   of   the   plastic<br>
material   due   to   overheating   during   a   curing   process,    it   is<br>
more preferable  that   the primer   composition   is   cured  at   90-<br>
120ºC for 0.5-4  hours.<br>
15              According     to     the     present     invention,      dry     coating<br>
thickness   may   be    0.1-40   µm,    preferably    1-10    µm   and   more<br>
preferably   2-5    µm.    If    the    thickness    is    less    than    2    µm,<br>
optical   density   is   low.   On   the   other  hand,   if   the   thickness.<br>
is more than 5 µm,   hardness, may  be decreased after  applying  a<br>
20      hard coating layer.<br>
Since the plastic lens coated with the photochromic<br>
primer layer has a soft surface, it is preferable to apply a<br>
hard coating layer on the primer layer. Even if a hard<br>
coating layer is formed, the primer coating layer formed<br>
25 between the hard coating layer and the plastic lene can<br>
prevent decrease of impact resistance.<br>
Silicone resins are preferable for a hard coating agent<br>
used   for   forming   the   hard  coating   layer.   Preferred examples<br>
of     silicone     resins      include      compositions     based     on      (A)<br>
30      inorganic    oxide     sol     formed     of    nano-particles    having    a<br>

particle diameter of 1-100 nm including at least one element<br>
selected from the group consisting of Ti, Zr, Si, Al, Sn, Sb,<br>
Ta, Ce, La, Fe, Zn, W and In; (B) a silane compound having no<br>
functional group; and/or (c) an epoxy-containing silicone<br>
5  compound or hydrolyzate thereof.<br>
The inorganic oxide sol (A) improves the hardness, heat<br>
resistance and weather resistance of a hard coating layer and<br>
increases the refractive index of a hard coating layer<br>
approximately to that of the lens so that a light<br>
10 interference phenomenon can be prevented. The protective<br>
coating agent including the silane compound (B) having no<br>
functional group may be a commercially available hard coating<br>
composition and is preferably STIIMS available from LG Chem.,<br>
Ltd. Examples of the epoxy-containing silicone compound (C)<br>
15 include Y-glycidoxypropyl trimethoxysilane, y-glycidoxypropyl<br>
methyldiethoxysilane, y-glycidoxypropyl triethoxy-silane,<br>
etc.<br>
Methods for coating a hard coating composition on the<br>
primer coating layer include a dipping method, a flow method,<br>
20  a spin coating method, a spray costing method, etc.,  but are<br>
not limited thereto.<br>
The hard coating layer can be formed by applying a hard<br>
coating composition onto the primer layer on the surface of a<br>
plastic lens, heating it at 80-120ºC for 1-24 hours and then<br>
26  curing it.  The thickness  of a hard coating  layer is<br>
preferably 0.5 to 5 µm and more preferably 1-4 µm.<br>

(l) Optical density (ΔOD)<br>
Cured lenses were irradiated with UV light having a<br>
wavelength of 365nm (1.35 mN/cm2) for 2 minutes. Right after<br>
25 this, the output light was measured for each lens at an<br>
activated state and a bleached state by using a UV-Vis<br>
detector. The optical density (ΔOD) at an activated state<br>
based on the optical density at a bleached state was<br>
calculated by the following formula:<br>

Steal wool was  mounted on  the   front-end  of  a   cylinder<br>
5      having a  diameter of 25 mm and  contacted with the surface  of<br>
a sample.   They were rotated  five   times  under a   load of  100  g<br>
and   then   observed   by  the   naked   eye.    (O:   no   damage   on    the<br>
surface,   Δ:   slightly damaged,   X:   excessively damaged) .<br>
(3)   Adhesive property<br>
10               A   crosscut   cellotaps   peel   test   was   performed   for   each<br>
coating in a cross linked and cured state. More particularly,<br>
each coating was notched with 11x11 lines in the longitudinal<br>
direction and the horizontal direction by a crosscut method<br>
at the line interval of 1 mm to form 100 divisions each<br>
15 having an area of 1 nm2. A cellotape was adhered on the<br>
notched coating and removed rapidly. Such operation was<br>
repeated three times at one position.<br>
O: no peeling after repeating 3  times<br>
Δ:    peeling   at   1   to    50    divisions    after   repeating   3<br>
20      times<br>
X:  peeling at 51-100  divisions  after  3 times<br>
(4)   Impact resistance<br>
Steel balls having a weight of 16.32 g and 24.82 g were<br>
set   at   a   height   of   131    cm    and    154    cm,    respectively,    and<br>
25     dropped downwardly to impact  on   the convex surface of a lens.<br>
Such a breaking test was  repeated while the  impact energy was<br>
gradually  increased.   When  a   lens   was   broken  or cracked,   the<br>
impact     energy    value    at    the     preceding    energy    level    was<br>
designated   as   impact   resistance   in   terms   of   impact   energy<br>

5               Industrial applicability<br>
As   mentioned   above,     conventional    photochromic   primer<br>
coatings   formed on   plastic  materials   by  using  a   photochromic<br>
dye   have    disadvantages    in    that    they    have    a     low    optical<br>
density   and   a   low   bleaching   rate.    However,    as   can   be   seen<br>
10      from   the   foregoing,   the  primer   composition  according   to   the<br>
present   invention  comprising   a   polar  polyurethane   containing<br>
a   Brønsted   salt,    a   polyepoxy   resin   and   a   photochromic   dye<br>
shows  a  high   optical  density  and  a  high  activation/bleaching<br>
rate when  coated on a plastic lens.<br>
