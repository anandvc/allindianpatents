				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
MOBILE TERMINAL AND MOBILE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a mobile terminal and a mobile<br>
communication system, in which normal communications are performed<br>
between the mobile terminal and a normal communication terminal via a first call<br>
control apparatus and emergency-communications are performed between the<br>
mobile terminal and an emergency-communication terminal via a second call<br>
control apparatus, in an IP network including the first and second call control<br>
apparatus.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), which is an<br>
international standardization organization for the third generation mobile<br>
communication system, has proposed a mobile communication system capable<br>
of performing emergency-communications between a mobile terminal and an<br>
emergency-communication terminal via an IP network (see Non-patent<br>
Document 1).<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, such mobile communication system includes an IP<br>
network configured of an IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) and an IP-CAN<br>
(GPRS/I-WLAN).<br>
Here, the IP-CAN is an acronym standing for "IP-Connectivity Access<br>
Network," GPRS is an acronym for "General Packet Radio Service," and<br>
l-WLAN is an acronym standing for "Interworking Wireless Access Network."<br>
In addition, the IMS is provided with a P-CSCF (Proxy-Call Sever Control<br>
Function), an S-CSCF (Serving-Call Server Control Function), an E-CSCF<br>
(Emergency-Call Server Control Function), and an HSS (Home Subscriber<br>
Server), while the IP-CAN (GPRS/I-WLAN) is provided with a function allowing<br>
the forwarding of IP data (SIP signals or VoIP packets).<br>
Here, the S-CSCF, the E-CSCF and the P-CSCF are SIP (Session<br>
Initiation Protocol) servers (call control apparatus) for controlling a<br><br><br>
normal-communication session between a mobile terminal UE and a normal<br>
communication terminal or an emergency-communication session between the<br>
mobile terminal UE and an emergency-communication terminal (PSAP: Public<br>
Safety Answering Point).<br>
Note that, the mobile terminal UE is configured to perform normal<br>
communications between the mobile terminal UE and a normal communication<br>
terminal (not shown in the drawings) via an S-CSCF#1 (first call control<br>
apparatus) and emergency-communications between the mobile terminal UE<br>
and the emergency-communication terminal PSAP, via an S-CSCF#2 (second<br>
call control apparatus) and an E-CSCF.<br>
By referring to Fig. 2, operations to start emergency-communications<br>
between the mobile terminal UE and PSAP in the above-described mobile<br>
communication system will be described.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, in step S7001, the mobile terminal UE transmits, to<br>
the P-CSCF, an "Normal Registration Request" for requesting that the<br>
S-CSCF#1 perform a normal-communication location registration process<br>
(Normal Registration process) for the mobile terminal UE, by using<br>
normal-communication user identifiers (IMPI: an IP Multimedia Private Identifier<br>
and a Normal IMPU: IP Multimedia Public Identity).<br>
In step S7002, in response to the "Normal Registration Request," the<br>
normal-communication location registration process for the mobile terminal UE is<br>
performed between the mobile terminal UE and the S-CSCF#1 by referring to<br>
the HSS.<br>
Thereafter, in step S7003, the mobile terminal UE transmits, to the<br>
P-CSCF, an "Emergency Registration Request" for requesting that the<br>
S-CSCF#2 perform an emergency-communication location registration process<br>
(Emergency Registration process) for the mobile terminal UE, by using an<br>
emergency-communication user identifier (Emergency IMPU).<br>
In step S7004, in response to the "Emergency Registration Request,"<br>
the emergency-communication location registration process for the mobile<br>
terminal UE is performed between the mobile terminal UE and the S-CSCF#2 by<br>
referring to the HSS.<br><br>
After the above emergency-communication location registration process<br>
is completed, in step S7005, the mobile terminal UE transmits, to the P-CSCF,<br>
an "Emergency SIP Invite" for requesting that an emergency-communication<br>
session establishment process be performed between the mobile terminal UE<br>
and the PSAP, by using the emergency-communication user identifier.<br>
In step S7006, the P-CSCF forwards the received "Emergency SIP<br>
Invite" to the E-CSCF.<br>
In step S7007, in response to the "Emergency SIP Invite," the<br>
emergency-communication session establishment process (Emergency Session<br>
Establishment process) is performed between the mobile terminal UE and the<br>
PSAP.<br>
The mobile terminal UE can perform emergency-communications<br>
between the mobile terminal UE and the PSAP by using the<br>
emergency-communication session establishment process set as described<br>
above.<br>
However, in the above-described mobile communication system, in<br>
order to allow emergency-communications from a mobile terminal in which a<br>
UICC is not provided (mobile terminal UE of a non-subscribed user), an<br>
emergency-communication location registration process, which is required only<br>
for performing emergency-communications, has to be performed, in addition to<br>
the normal-communication location registration process.<br>
In addition, the above-described mobile communication system requires<br>
to perform both of the normal-communication location registration process and<br>
the emergency-communication location registration process, since a<br>
normal-communication call control! apparatus (S-CSCF#1) is different from an<br>
emergency-communication call control apparatus (S-CSCF#2) provided to a<br>
command station of, for example, police, fire, Japan Coast Guard services or the<br>
like.<br>
Examples of the aforementioned example in which a<br>
normal-communication call control apparatus (S-CSCF#1) is different from an<br>
emergency-communication call control apparatus (S-CSCF#2) includes an<br>
example in which a mobile terminal UE performs an emergency-communication<br><br>
session establishment process from a network outside its home network.<br>
Accordingly, in the above-described communication system, even when<br>
a normal-communication location registration process for a certain mobile<br>
terminal UE is completed, an emergency-communication registration process for<br>
the mobile terminal UE has to be additionally performed. Thus, the<br>
communication system has a problem that time until starting<br>
emergency-communications is longer.<br>

BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
(Configuration of a mobile communication system according to a first<br>
embodiment of the present invention)<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, a mobile communication system according to the<br>
present embodiment is configured so that a mobile terminal LIE perform normal<br>
communications between the mobile terminal UE and a normal communication<br>
terminal via the S-CSCF#1; and emergency-communications between the<br>
mobile terminal UE and a PSAP (emergency-communication terminal) via the<br>
S-CSCF#2 and the E-CSCF, in the IP network including an S-CSCF#1 (first call<br>
control apparatus), an S-CSCF#2 (second call control apparatus), an E-CSCF,<br>
and a P-CSCF.<br>
Here, as will be described later, such IP network is configured so that an<br>
emergency-communication session establishment process (Emergency Session<br><br><br>
Establishment process) between the mobile terminal UE and the PSAP would be<br>
performed even when an emergency-communication location registration<br>
process (Emergency Registration process ) for the mobile terminal UE is not<br>
performed in the S-CSCS#2, as long as a normal-communication location<br>
registration process (Normal Registration process ) for the mobile terminal UE<br>
is completed in the S-CSCS#1.<br>
Referring to Fig. 3, the configuration of the mobile terminal UE according<br>
to the first embodiment of the present invention will be described.<br>
The mobile terminal UE according to the present embodiment is<br>
configured so as to perform normal communications between the mobile<br>
terminal UE and a normal communication terminal via the S-CSCF#1; and<br>
emergency-communications between the mobile terminal UE and the PSAP via<br>
the S-CSCF#2 and the E-CSCF in the above-described IP network.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, the mobile terminal UE according to the present<br>
embodiment is provide with a UICC detecting unit 11, a Normal Registration<br>
processing unit 12, an Emergency Registration processing unit 13, and an<br>
Emergency Session Establishment processing unit 14.<br>
The UICC detecting unit 11 is configured to detect whether a UICC<br>
(Universal Integrated Circuit Card) is provided in the mobile terminal UE.<br>
The Normal Registration processing unit 12 is configured to perform a<br>
normal-communication location registration process (Normal Registration<br>
process) for the mobile terminal UE in the S-CSCF#1 when a predetermined<br>
condition, for example, at power-on of the mobile terminal UE is satisfied.<br>
Specifically, in order to perform the normal-communication location<br>
registration process , the Normal Registration processing unit 12 is configured to<br>
transmit, to the P-CSCF, a normal registration request for requesting that a<br>
normal-communication location registration process be performed by using<br>
normal-communication user identifiers.<br>
The Emergency Registration processing unit 13 is configured to perform<br>
an emergency-communication location registration process (Emergency<br>
Registration process) for the mobile terminal UE in the S-CSCF#2 when a<br>
predetermined condition is satisfied.<br><br><br>
Specifically, the Emergency Registration processing unit 13 is configured<br>
to transmit, to the P-CSCF, an emergency registration request for requesting that<br>
an emergency-communication location registration process be performed by<br>
using emergency-communication user identifiers, in order to perform the<br>
emergency-communication location registration process.<br>
For example, when a UICC is not provided in the mobile terminal UE or a<br>
normal-communication location registration process for the mobile terminal UE is<br>
not completed in the S-CSCF#1, the Emergency Registration processing unit 13<br>
is configured to transmit, to the P-CSCF, an emergency registration request for<br>
requesting that the S-CSCF#2 perform emergency-communication location<br>
registration process for the mobile terminal UE by using<br>
emergency-communication user identifiers.<br>
When the predetermined condition is satisfied, the Emergency Session<br>
Establishment processing unit 14 is configured to perform an<br>
emergency-communication session establishment process (Emergency Session<br>
Establishment process) for performing emergency-communications between the<br>
mobile terminal UE and the PSAP via the S-CSCF#2 and the E-CSCF.<br>
Specifically, in order to perform such emergency-communication session<br>
establishment process, the Emergency Session Establishment processing unit<br>
14 is configured to transmit an emergency-communication session<br>
establishment process request (Emergency SIP Invite) for requesting that an<br>
emergency-communication session establishment process be performed<br>
between the mobile terminal UE and the PSAP.<br>
For example, the Emergency Session Establishment processing unit 14<br>
is configured to perform an emergency-communication session establishment<br>
process between the mobile terminal UE and the PSAP without performing an<br>
emergency-communication location registration process for the mobile terminal<br>
UE in the S-CSCF#2, when a normal-communication location registration<br>
process for the mobile terminal UE is completed in the S-CSCF#1, and when it is<br>
determined that not both of the normal-communication for the mobile terminal<br>
UE and emergency-communication location registration process for the mobile<br>
terminal UE need to be performed in order to perform the<br><br><br>
emergency-communications in the above-described IP network.<br>
Here, the Emergency Session Establishment processing unit 14 may be<br>
configured to make the above-described determination based on information<br>
(determination key, for example) notified from the IP network in performing the<br>
normal-communication location registration process for the mobile terminal UE.<br>
In addition, the Emergency Session Establishment processing unit 14 is<br>
configured to perform an emergency-communication session establishment<br>
process between the mobile terminal UE and the PSAP without performing a<br>
normal-communication location registration process for the mobile terminal UE<br>
in the S-CSCF#1, when an emergency-communication location registration<br>
process for the mobile terminal UE is completed in the S-CSCF #1 in response<br>
to the above-mentioned emergency registration request.<br>
(Operations of the mobile communication system according to the first<br>
embodiment of the present invention)<br>
Hereinafter, operations of the mobile communication system according<br>
to the present embodiment will be described by referring to Figs. 4 to 10.<br>
Specifically, the operations of the mobile terminal UE according to the<br>
present embodiment will be described by referring to Figs. 4 to 6 and the<br>
operations of the mobile communication system according to the present<br>
embodiment will be described by referring to Figs. 7 to 10.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, in step S101, an emergency call to be transmitted<br>
from the mobile terminal UE to the PSAP occurs.<br>
In step S102, the mobile terminal UE determines whether a UICC is<br>
provided in the mobile terminal UE.<br>
When it is determined that a UICC is provided in the mobile terminal UE,<br>
the present operation proceeds to step S103 to execute the procedure 1 shown<br>
in Fig. 5. When it is determined that a UICC is not provided in the mobile<br>
terminal UE, the present operation proceeds to step S104 to execute the<br>
procedure 2 shown in Fig. 6.<br>
Firstly, with reference to Fig. 5, operations of the procedure 1 performed<br>
by the mobile terminal UE will be described.<br><br><br>
As shown in Fig. 5, in step S201, the mobile terminal UE determines<br>
whether a normal-communication location registration process for the mobile<br>
terminal UE is completed in the S-CSCF#1.<br>
When it is determined that the normal-communication location<br>
registration process is completed, the present operation proceeds to step S202.<br>
When it is determined that the normal-communication location registration<br>
process is not completed, the procedure 2 shown in Fig. 6 is executed in the<br>
present operation.<br>
In step S202, the mobile terminal UE determines whether an<br>
emergency-communication location registration process for the mobile terminal<br>
UE needs to be performed in the S-CSCF#2, based on information<br>
(determination key, for example) notified from the IP network in performing the<br>
normal-communication location registration process for the mobile terminal UE.<br>
In other words, the mobile terminal UE determines whether both of the<br>
normal-communication for the mobile terminal UE and the<br>
emergency-communication location registration process for the mobile terminal<br>
UE need to be performed in order to perform emergency-communications in the<br>
IP network.<br>
When it is determined that both of the normal-communication location<br>
registration process and the emergency-communication location registration<br>
process need to be performed, the present operation proceeds to step S203.<br>
When it-is determined that not both of the normal-communication location<br>
registration process and the emergency-communication location registration<br>
process need to be performed, the present operation proceeds to step S105 in<br>
Fig. 4.<br>
In step S203, the mobile terminal UE transmits, to the P-CSCF, an<br>
emergency registration request for requesting that an<br>
emergency-communication location registration process be performed by using<br>
emergency-communication user identifiers, in order to perform the<br>
emergency-communication location registration process .<br>
In step S204, the mobile terminal UE performs the emergency<br>
registration between the mobile terminal UE and the S-CSCF#2. Thereafter,<br><br><br>
the present operation proceeds to step S105 in Fig. 4.<br>
Secondly, with referring to Fig. 6, operations of the procedure 2<br>
performed by the mobile terminal UE will be described.<br>
As shown in Fig. 6, in step S301, the mobile terminal UE transmits, to<br>
the P-CSCF, an emergency registration request for requesting that the<br>
S-CSCF#2 perform an emergency-communication location registration process<br>
for the mobile terminal UE by using emergency-communication user identifiers.<br>
In step S302, the mobile terminal UE determines whether a<br>
normal-communication location registration process for the mobile terminal UE<br>
needs to be performed in the S-CSCF#1, based on an instruction included in a<br>
response from the P-CSCF for the emergency registration request. In other<br>
words, the mobile terminal UE determines whether a normal-communication<br>
location registration process for the mobile terminal UE needs to be performed<br>
before an emergency-communication location registration process for the mobile<br>
terminal UE is performed in the IP network.<br>
When it is determined that the normal-communication location<br>
registration process needs to be performed, the present operation proceeds to<br>
step S303. When it is determined that the normal-communication location<br>
registration process does not need to be performed, the present operation<br>
proceeds to step S305.<br>
In step S303, the mobile terminal UE transmits, to the P-CSCF, a normal<br>
registration request for requesting that a normal-communication location<br>
registration process be performed by using normal-communication user<br>
identifiers, in order to perform such normal-communication location registration<br>
process.<br>
In step S304, the mobile terminal UE performs a normal-communication<br>
location registration process for the mobile terminal UE between the mobile<br>
terminal UE and the S-CSCF#1. Thereafter, the present operation proceeds to<br>
step S202 in Fig. 5.<br>
Note that, when a UICC is not provided in the mobile terminal UE, the<br>
mobile terminal UE cannot perform the normal-communication location<br>
registration process by using a normal-communication user identifier and thus<br><br><br>
cannot perform emergency-communications between the mobile terminal UE<br>
and the PSAP.<br>
In step S305, the mobile terminal UE performs an<br>
emergency-communication location registration process for the mobile terminal<br>
UE between the mobile terminal UE and the S-CSCF#2. Thereafter, the<br>
present operation proceeds to step S105 in Fig. 4.<br>
In step S105, the mobile terminal UE transmits, to the P-CSCF,<br>
emergency-communication session establishment process request (Emergency<br>
SIP Invite) for requesting that an emergency-communication session<br>
establishment process be performed between the mobile terminal UE and the<br>
PSAP, in order to perform the emergency-communication session establishment<br>
process between the mobile terminal UE and the PSAP.<br>
In step S106, the mobile terminal UE performs the<br>
emergency-communication session establishment process between the mobile<br>
terminal UE and the PSAP, the emergency-communication session<br>
establishment process being used for emergency-communications.<br>
Next, operations (in four cases) to start emergency-communications<br>
between the mobile terminal UE and a PSAP in the mobile communication<br>
system according to the present embodiment will be described by referring to<br>
Figs. 7 to 10.<br>
Firstly, the operations of the mobile communication system according to<br>
a first case of the present embodiment will be described by referring to Fig. 7.<br>
In the first case, as shown in Fig. 7, the mobile terminal UE determines:<br>
that a UICC is provided in the mobile terminal UE in step S1001; that a<br>
normal-communication location registration process for the mobile terminal UE is<br>
completed in the S-CSCF#1 in step S1002; and that, in step S2003, not both of<br>
the normal-communication location registration process and the<br>
emergency-communication location registration process for the mobile terminal<br>
UE need to be performed, in performing the emergency-communications in the<br>
IP network.<br>
In such case, in step S1004, the mobile terminal UE transmits, to the<br>
P-CSCF, an emergency-communication session establishment process request<br><br><br>
for requesting that an emergency-communication session establishment process<br>
(Emergency Session Establishment process) be performed between the mobile<br>
terminal UE and the PSAP by using normal-communication user identifiers,<br>
without performing an emergency-communication location registration process<br>
for the mobile terminal UE in the S-CSCF#2.<br>
In step S1005, the P-CSCF forwards the received<br>
emergency-communication session establishment process request to the<br>
E-CSCF.<br>
In step S1006, the E-CSCF forwards the received<br>
emergency-communication session establishment process request to the PSAP.<br>
In step S1007, an emergency-communication location registration<br>
process for the mobile terminal UE is not performed in the S-CSCF#2.<br>
Nonetheless, the emergency-communication session establishment process<br>
between the mobile terminal UE and the PSAP is performed, since the<br>
normal-communication location registration process for the mobile terminal UE is<br>
completed in the S-CSCF#1.<br>
By using the emergency-communication session establishment process<br>
set as described above, the mobile terminal UE can perform<br>
emergency-communications between the mobile terminal UE and the PSAP.<br>
Secondly, the operations of the mobile communication system according<br>
to a second case of the present embodiment will be described by referring to Fig.<br>
8.<br>
In the second case, as shown in Fig. 8, the mobile terminal UE<br>
determines: that a UICC is provided in the mobile terminal UE in step S2001;<br>
that a normal-communication location registration process for the mobile<br>
terminal UE is completed in the S-CSCF in step S2002; and that, in step S2003,<br>
both of the normal-communication location registration process and the<br>
emergency-communication location registration process for the mobile terminal<br>
UE need to be performed in order to perform emergency-communications in the<br>
IP network.<br>
In step S2004, the mobile terminal UE transmits, to the P-CSCF, an<br>
emergency registration request for requesting that the S-CSCF#2 perform an<br><br><br>
emergency-communication location registration process for the mobile terminal<br>
UE by using emergency-communication user identifiers.<br>
In step S2005, in response to the emergency registration request, an<br>
emergency-communication location registration process for the mobile terminal<br>
UE is performed between the mobile terminal UE and the S-CSCF#2, by<br>
referring to the HSS.<br>
In step S2006, the mobile terminal UE transmits, to the P-CSCF, an<br>
emergency-communication session establishment process request (Emergency<br>
SIP Invite) for requesting that an emergency-communication session<br>
establishment process be performed between the mobile terminal UE and the<br>
PSAP by using emergency-communication user identifiers, after the<br>
emergency-communication location registration process is completed.<br>
In step S2007, the P-CSCF forwards the received Emergency SIP Invite<br>
to the E-CSCF.<br>
In step S2008, the E-CSCF forwards the received<br>
Emergency-communication session establishment process request to the PSAP.<br>
In step S2009, in response to the Emergency SIP Invite, the<br>
emergency-communication session establishment process between the mobile<br>
terminal UE and the PSAP is performed between the mobile terminal UE and the<br>
PSAP.<br>
By using the emergency-communication session establishment process<br>
set as described above, the mobile terminal UE can perform<br>
emergency-communications between the mobile terminal UE and the PSAP.<br>
Thirdly, the operations of the mobile communication system according to<br>
a third case of the present embodiment will be described while referring to Fig. 9.<br>
In the third case, as shown in Fig. 9, the mobile terminal UE determines:<br>
that a UICC is provided in the mobile terminal UE in step S3001; and that a<br>
normal-communication location registration process for the mobile terminal UE is<br>
not completed in the S-CSCF#1 in step S3002.<br>
In step S3003, the mobile terminal UE transmits, to the P-CSCF, an<br>
emergency registration request for requesting that the S-CSCF#2 perform an<br>
emergency-communication location registration process for the mobile terminal<br><br><br>
UE by using emergency-communication user identifiers.<br>
In step S3004, in response to the emergency registration request, the<br>
P-CSCF transmits a response including an instruction indicating whether or not a<br>
normal-communication location registration process for the mobile terminal UE<br>
needs to be performed before performing an emergency-communication location<br>
registration process for the mobile terminal UE in the IP network.<br>
In step S3005, the mobile terminal UE determines, based on the<br>
response from the P-CSCF, whether or not a normal-communication location<br>
registration process for the mobile terminal UE needs to be performed before<br>
performing an emergency-communication location registration process for the<br>
mobile terminal UE in the IP network.<br>
Here, in the third case, it is determined that a normal-communication<br>
location registration process for the mobile terminal UE needs to be performed<br>
before an emergency-communication location registration process for the mobile<br>
terminal UE is performed in the IP network.<br>
In step S3006, the mobile terminal UE transmits, to the P-CSCF, a<br>
normal registration request for requesting that the S-CSCF#1 perform the<br>
normal-communication location registration process (Normal Registration<br>
process) for the mobile terminal UE by using normal-communication user<br>
identifiers.<br>
In step S3007, in response to the normal registration request, the<br>
normal-communication location registration process for the mobile terminal UE is<br>
performed between the mobile terminal UE and the S-CSCF#1 by referring to<br>
the HSS.<br>
In step S3008, the mobile terminal UE determines whether an<br>
emergency-communication location registration process for the mobile terminal<br>
UE needs to be performed in the S-CSCF#2, based on information<br>
(determination key, for example) notified from the IP network in the<br>
normal-communication location registration process for the mobile terminal UE<br>
performed in step S3007. That is, the mobile terminal UE determines whether<br>
both of the normal-communication location registration process and the<br>
emergency-communication location registration process for the mobile terminal<br><br><br>
UE need to be performed, in performing emergency-communications in the IP<br>
network.<br>
Here, in the third case, assume that it is determined that not both of the<br>
normal-communication location registration process and the<br>
emergency-communication location registration process for the mobile terminal<br>
UE need to be performed, in performing the emergency-communications.<br>
In step S3009, the mobile terminal UE transmits, to the P-CSCF, an<br>
Emergency-communication session establishment process request for<br>
requesting that an emergency-communication session establishment process be<br>
performed between the mobile terminal UE and the PSAP by using<br>
normal-communication user identifiers without performing an<br>
emergency-communication location registration process for the mobile terminal<br>
UE in the S-CSCF#2.<br>
In step S3010, the P-CSCF forwards the received<br>
Emergency-communication session establishment process request to the<br>
E-CSCF.<br>
In step S3011, the E-CSCF forwards the received<br>
Emergency-communication session establishment process request to the PSAP.<br>
In step S3012, an emergency-communication location registration<br>
process for the mobile terminal UE is not performed in the S-CSCF#2.<br>
Nonetheless, an emergency-communication session establishment process<br>
between the mobile terminal UE and the PSAP is performed, since in the<br>
above-described IP network, the normal-communication location registration<br>
process for the mobile terminal UE is completed in the S-CSCF#1.<br>
By using the emergency-communication session establishment process<br>
set as described above, the mobile terminal UE can perform<br>
emergency-communications between the mobile terminal UE and the PSAP.<br>
Fourthly, the operations of the mobile communication system according<br>
to a fourth case of the present embodiment will be described while referring to<br>
Fig. 10.<br>
In the fourth case, as shown in Fig. 10, the mobile terminal UE<br>
determines: that a UICC is provided in the mobile terminal UE in step S4001;<br><br><br>
and that a normal-communication location registration process for the mobile<br>
terminal UE is not completed in the S-CSCF#1, in step S4002.<br>
Alternatively, in step S4001 of the fourth case, the mobile terminal UE<br>
may determine that a UICC is not provided in the mobile terminal UE, as shown<br>
in Fig. 10.<br>
In either case, in step S4003, the mobile terminal UE transmits, to the<br>
P-CSCF, an emergency registration request for requesting that the S-CSCF#2<br>
perform an emergency-communication location registration process for the<br>
mobile terminal UE by using emergency-communication user identifiers.<br>
In step S4004, in response to the emergency registration request, the<br>
P-CSCF determines that a normal-communication location registration process<br>
for the mobile terminal UE does not need to be performed before the<br>
emergency-communication location registration process for the mobile terminal<br>
UE is performed in the IP network. Then, the emergency-communication<br>
location registration process for the mobile terminal UE is performed between<br>
the mobile terminal UE and the S-CSCF#2 by referring to the HSS.<br>
In step S4005, the mobile terminal UE transmits, to the P-CSCF, an<br>
emergency-communication session establishment process request (Emergency<br>
SIP Invite) for requesting that an emergency-communication session<br>
establishment process be performed between the mobile terminal UE and the<br>
PSAP by using emergency-communication user identifiers after the<br>
above-described emergency-communication location registration process is<br>
completed.<br>
In step S4006, the P-CSCF forwards the received Emergency SIP Invite<br>
to the E-CSCF.<br>
In step S4007, the E-CSCF forwards the received<br>
emergency-communication session establishment process request to the PSAP.<br>
In step S4008, in response to the Emergency SIP Invite, the<br>
emergency-communication session establishment process between the mobile<br>
terminal UE and the PSAP is performed between the mobile terminal UE and the<br>
PSAP by referring to the HSS, although a normal-communication location<br>
registration process for the mobile terminal UE is not performed in the<br><br><br>
S-CSCF#1.<br>
By using the emergency-communication session establishment process<br>
set as described above, the mobile terminal UE can perform<br>
emergency-communications between the mobile terminal UE and the PSAP.<br>
(Advantageous effects of the mobile communication system according to the first<br>
embodiment of the present invention)<br>
In the mobile terminal and the mobile communication system according<br>
to the present embodiment, an emergency-communication session<br>
establishment process would be performed between the mobile terminal UE and<br>
the PSAP without performing an emergency-communication location registration<br>
process for the mobile terminal UE in the S-CSCF#2, when a<br>
normal-communication location registration process for the mobile terminal is<br>
completed in the S-CSCF#1 and it is determined that not both of the<br>
normal-communication location registration process and the<br>
emergency-communication location registration process for the mobile terminal<br>
UE need to be performed, in performing the emergency-communications in the<br>
IP network. Accordingly, time until starting emergency-communications in an IP<br>
network can be shortened.<br>
In addition, in the mobile terminal and the mobile communication system<br>
according to the present embodiment, when it is determined that both of the<br>
normal-communication location registration process and the<br>
emergency-communication location registration process for the mobile terminal<br>
UE need to be performed in performing the emergency-communications in the IP<br>
network and when a normal-communication location registration process for the<br>
mobile terminal UE is completed in the S-CSCF#1, an<br>
emergency-communication session establishment process is performed<br>
between the mobile terminal UE and the PSAP after an<br>
emergency-communication location registration process for the mobile terminal<br>
UE is performed in the S-CSCF#2. Accordingly, the mobile terminal and the<br>
mobile communication system according to the present embodiment are<br>
applicable to a conventional IP network in which both of the<br><br><br>
normal-communication location registration process and the<br>
emergency-communication location registration process for the mobile terminal<br>
UE need to be performed, in performing emergency-communications. Also, the<br>
mobile terminal and the mobile communication system according to the present<br>
embodiment are applicable to the IP network according to the present invention<br>
in which not both of the normal-communication location registration process and<br>
the emergency-communication location registration process for the mobile<br>
terminal UE need to be performed in performing emergency-communications.<br>
In addition, when a UICC is not provided in the mobile terminal UE, or<br>
when an emergency-communication location registration process for the mobile<br>
terminal UE is completed in the 3-CSCF#2 in response to an emergency<br>
registration request transmitted by the mobile terminal UE and when a<br>
normal-communication location registration process for the mobile terminal UE is<br>
not completed in the S-CSCF#1, the mobile terminal and mobile communication<br>
system according to the present embodiment are configured that an<br>
emergency-communication session establishment process would be performed<br>
between the mobile terminal UE and the PSAP without performing a<br>
normal-communication location registration process for the mobile terminal UE<br>
in the S-CSCF#1. Accordingly, time until starting emergency-communications<br>
in the IP network can be shortened.<br>
(A mobile communication system according to a second embodiment of the<br>
present invention)<br>
Referring to Figs. 11 to 16, a mobile communication system according to<br>
a second embodiment of the present invention will be described.<br>
In the present embodiment, the above-described S-CSCF#1 (first call<br>
control apparatus) and the S-CSCF#2 (second call control apparatus) are<br>
provided in the same apparatus (S-CSCF).<br>
Specifically, operations of the mobile terminal UE according to the<br>
present embodiment will be described by referring to Figs. 11 and 12, and<br>
operations of the mobile communication system according to the present<br>
embodiment will be described by referring to Figs. 13 to 16.<br><br>
As shown in Fig. 11, in step S501, an emergency call to be performed<br>
from the mobile terminal UE to the PSAP occurs.<br>
In step S102, the mobile terminal UE determines whether a UICC is<br>
provided in the mobile terminal UE.<br>
When it is determined that a UICC is provided in the mobile terminal UE,<br>
the present operation proceeds to step S503 to execute the procedure 1.<br>
When it is determined that a UICC is not provided in the mobile terminal UE, the<br>
present operation proceeds to step S504.<br>
Here, by referring to Fig. 12, operations of the procedure 1 performed by<br>
the mobile terminal UE will be described.<br>
As shown in Fig. 12, in step S601, the mobile terminal UE determines<br>
whether or not the mobile terminal UE is located in a Home network or in a<br>
visited network, by using information acquired from an IP network in performing,<br>
for example, a GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) attach process<br>
(registration process for GPRS) or l-WLAN attach process (registration process<br>
for l-WLAN), based on information notified from the IP network in performing a<br>
registration process in the IP network.<br>
When it is determined that the mobile terminal UE is located in the Home<br>
network, the present operation proceeds to step S602. When it is determined<br>
that the mobile terminal UE is located in the visited network, the present<br>
operation proceeds to step S603.<br>
In step S602, the mobile terminal UE determines whether a<br>
normal-communication location registration process for the mobile terminal UE is<br>
completed in the S-CSCF#1.<br>
When it is determined that the normal-communication location<br>
registration process for the mobile terminal UE is completed, the present<br>
operation proceeds to step S504 in Fig. 11. When it is determined that the<br>
normal-communication location registration process for the mobile terminal UE is<br>
not completed, the present operation proceeds to step S603.<br>
In step S603, the mobile terminal UE transmits, to the P-CSCF, an<br>
emergency registration request for requesting that an<br>
emergency-communication location registration process be performed by using<br><br><br>
emergency-communication user identifiers, in order to perform the<br>
emergency-communication location registration process.<br>
In step S604, after the mobile terminal UE performs the emergency<br>
registration between the mobile terminal UE and the S-CSCF#2, the present<br>
operation proceeds to step S504 in Fig. 11.<br>
Specifically, the mobile terminal UE determines whether an<br>
emergency-communication location registration process for the mobile terminal<br>
UE needs to be performed in the S-CSCF#2 based on information<br>
(determination key, for example) notified from the IP network in performing the<br>
registration process for the mobile terminal UE in the IP network. In other<br>
words, the mobile terminal UE determines whether both of the<br>
normal-communication location registration process and the<br>
emergency-communication location registration process for the mobile terminal<br>
UE need to be performed in performing the emergency-communications in the IP<br>
network.<br>
Specifically, when it is determined that the mobile terminal UE is located<br>
in the Home network, based on the information (determination key, for example)<br>
notified from the IP network in the registration process for the mobile terminal UE<br>
in the IP network, the mobile terminal UE determines that not both of the<br>
normal-communication location registration process and the<br>
emergency-communication location registration process for the mobile terminal<br>
UE need to be performed in performing the emergency-communications in the IP<br>
network.<br>
On the other hand, when it is determined that the mobile terminal UE is<br>
not located in the Home network (that is, located in the visited network), based<br>
on the information (for example, determination key) notified from the IP network<br>
in the registration process for the mobile terminal UE in the IP network, the<br>
mobile terminal UE determines that both of the normal-communication location<br>
registration process and the emergency-communication location registration<br>
process for the mobile terminal UE need to be performed in performing the<br>
emergency-communications in the IP network.<br>
In step S504, the mobile terminal UE transmits, to the P-CSCF, an<br><br>
emergency-communication session establishment process request (Emergency<br>
SIP Invite) for requesting that an emergency-communication session<br>
establishment process be performed between the mobile terminal UE and the<br>
PSAP, in order to perform an emergency-communication session establishment<br>
process used for emergency-communications between the mobile terminal UE<br>
and the PSAP.<br>
In step S505, the mobile terminal UE performs the<br>
emergency-communication session establishment process used for<br>
emergency-communications between the mobile terminal UE and the PSAP.<br>
Next, operations (in four cases) to start emergency-communications<br>
between the mobile terminal UE and the PSAP in the mobile communication<br>
system according to the present embodiment will be described by referring to<br>

terminal UE is located in the Home network in step S5002; and that a<br>
normal-communication location registration process for the mobile terminal UE is<br>
completed in step S5003.<br>
In such case, in step S5004, the mobile terminal UE transmits, to the<br>
P-CSCF, an emergency-communication session establishment process request<br>
(Emergency SIP Invite) for requesting that an emergency-communication<br>
session establishment process (Emergency Session Establishment process) be<br>
performed between the mobile terminal UE and the PSAP by using<br>

In step S5007, an emergency-communication location registration<br>
process for the mobile terminal UE is not performed in the S-CSCF#2 in the<br>
above-described IP network. Nonetheless, an emergency-communication<br>
session establishment process between the mobile terminal UE and the PSAP is<br>
performed, since the normal-communication location registration process for the<br>
mobile terminal UE is completed in the S-CSCF#1.<br>
By using the emergency-communication session establishment process<br>

emergency-communication location registration process for the mobile terminal<br>
UE is performed between the mobile terminal UE and the S-CSCF#2 by referring<br>
to the HSS.<br>
In step S6006, the mobile terminal UE transmits, to the P-CSCF, an<br>

emergency-communication location registration process for the mobile terminal<br>
UE by using emergency-communication user identifiers.<br>
In step S7004, in response to the emergency registration request, an<br>
emergency-communication location registration process for the mobile terminal<br>
UE is performed between the mobile terminal UE and S-CSCF#2 by referring to<br>
the HSS.<br>
In step S7005, the mobile terminal UE transmits, to the P-CSCF, an<br>
Emergency-communication session establishment process request for<br>
requesting that an emergency-communication session establishment process be<br>
performed between the mobile terminal UE and the PSAP by using a user<br>
normal-communication user identifier without performing an<br>
emergency-communication location registration process for the mobile terminal<br>
UE in the S-CSCF#2.<br><br><br>
In step S7006, the P-CSCF forwards the received<br>
Emergency-communication session establishment process request to the<br>
E-CSCF.<br>
In step S7007, the E-CSCF forwards the received<br>

terminal UE and the PSAP is performed, since the normal-communication<br>
location registration process for the mobile terminal UE is completed in the<br>
S-CSCF#1.<br>
By using the emergency-communication session establishment process<br>
set as described above, the mobile terminal UE can perform<br>

emergency-communication session establishment process request (Emergency<br>
SIP Invite) for requesting that an emergency-communication session<br>
establishment process be performed between the mobile terminal UE and the<br>
PSAP by using emergency-communication user identifiers.<br>
In step S8003, the P-CSCF forwards the received Emergency SIP Invite<br>
to the E-CSCF.<br>
In step S8004, the E-CSCF forwards the received<br>
Emergency-communication session establishment process request to the PSAP.<br>
In step S8005, a normal-communication location registration process for<br>
the mobile terminal UE is not performed in the S-CSCF#1. Nonetheless, an<br><br><br>
emergency-communication session establishment process between the mobile<br>
terminal UE and the PSAP is performed between the mobile terminal UE and the<br>
PSAP by referring to the HSS in response to the Emergency SIP Invite.<br>
By using the emergency-communication session establishment process<br>
set as described above, the mobile terminal UE can perform<br>
emergency-communications.<br>
