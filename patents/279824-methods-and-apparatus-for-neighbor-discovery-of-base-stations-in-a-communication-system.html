				<td>METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR NEIGHBOR DISCOVERY OF BASE STATIONS IN A COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
Claim of Priority under 35 U.S.C. §119<br>
[0001]	The present Application for Patent claims priority to Provisional Application<br>
No. 60/944,711 entitled "NEIGHBOR DISCOVERY OF BASE STATIONS IN A COMMUNICATION NETWORK" filed June 18, 2007, and assigned to the assignee hereof and hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein.<br>
BACKGROUND Field<br>
[0002]	The present disclosure generally relates to methods and apparatus for neighbor<br>
discovery of base stations in a communication system, and more particularly to an automated neighbor discovery by a base station with the assistance of an access terminal.<br>
Background<br>
[0003]	In communication  systems,  such  as  wireless communication  systems,  base<br>
stations serving communication content may maintain data concerning neighboring base stations within the communication system. Neighboring base stations are those base stations geographically situated relative to a particular base station that represent viable candidates to which to a mobile communication device being currently served by the particular base station might handed off to as the mobile communication changes location.<br>
[0004]	In certain wireless communication systems, such those employing Ultra Mobile<br>
Broadband (UMB) technology or LTE (Long Term Evolution technology) having an Evolved Packet System (EPS), the communication network linking the base stations may be used by the base stations to communicate respective information to other base stations in the network (e.g., evolved base stations (eBS) in a converged access network, such as a radio area network (RAN), connected via an access gateway (AGW)). Additionally in such systems, when an access terminal (AT) undergoes a handoff from one base station to another, the AT will report neighboring base station information<br>
 <br>
(e.g., a Pilot ID) at the time of handoff, which saves overhead resources. Normally if the network neighboring base station is known to the base station handing off, the identifying information is sufficient for handing off within the network. However, whenever a new base station is added or removed from the RAN, these conventional systems require an operator to manually reconfigure all of the affected base stations, which becomes particularly burdensome, making acquisition expensive, and is less homogeneous, especially if temporary base stations are used within a network.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0005]	According to an aspect, a method of discovering a first base station by a second<br>
base station in a communication system is disclosed. The method includes receiving a first message from an access terminal to assist the access terminal to handoff from the second base station to the first base station based on detecting of an identification signal by the access terminal from the first base station in the communication system. The method further includes determining whether the first base station is a known base station based on the identification signal, and transmitting a second message to the access terminal requesting a network identification of the first base station when a determination is made that the first base station is not a known base station. The method also includes receiving a third message from the access terminal in response to the second message including the network identification of the first base station, and sending a request for identification data to the first base station based on the network identification.<br>

 <br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0023]	The presently disclosed method and apparatus effect neighbor discovery (ND) of<br>
base stations in a communication system, and more particularly automatic neighbor discovery by a base station with the assistance of an access terminal. That is, an access terminal detecting wirelessly broadcast identification information from a base station, may communicate that information to other base stations to assist the base station in ND. Once ND is performed, the base stations may update the network of base stations (e.g., a RAN) such that information is exchanged between neighboring base stations via any one or a number of means, such as a gateway/network, to achieve full operational capability. By utilizing identifying information already normally detected by an access terminal and reported to a base station during handoffs (e.g., Pilot ID), manual configuration of newly added (or dropped) base stations may be eliminated.<br>
[0024]	In the following described examples, for reasons of conciseness and clarity the<br>
disclosure uses terminology associated with Ultra Mobile Broadband (UMB) technology. H should be emphasized, however, that the presently described examples are also applicable to other technologies, such as technologies related to Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA), Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) and so forth. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, that when applying the disclosed methods and apparatus to other technologies, the associated terminology would clearly be different,<br>
[0025]	Turning to FIG. 1, this diagram illustrates a communication system 100 in which<br>
the presently disclosed methods and apparatus may be utilized. As shown, the communication system 100 includes at least one base station 102 or similar apparatus that functions to serve communications to one or more mobile devices, such as an access terminal 104 (AT). In this particular example using the nomenclature of UMB, base station 102 is an evolved base station (eBS) given the designation of eBSi,<br>
[0026]	Each base station in the communication system 100 is in communication wiLh a<br>
Gateway/Network 106. Again using the nomenclature of UMB, the Gateway/Network 106 may be comprised of an Access Gateway (AGW), in connection with a wide area network, such as the internet. The coupling of the Gateway/Network 106 to base stations (eBS's), such as coupling 108 affords extension of Internet Protocol (IP) to each eBS in the communication system 100, which also enables faster switching of an AT<br>
 <br>
between base stations in the system 100. The entirety of eBS's in communication with the Gateway/Network 106 effect a converged access network or radio access network (RAN) 109.<br>
[0027]	Each base station  in the communication system   100 periodically transmits<br>
respective contact or identification information on overhead channels. Examples of the type of information contained in the identification information using UMB nomenclature includes network identification information (e.g., an AN1D, which may contain an IP address, a mechanism to map the network identification information to the IP address, or Sector ID), as well as a pilotlD. Accordingly, when an AT such as AT 104 first detects a pilot channel and more particularly a pilotlD, from another neighboring eBS, such as eBSa HO in FIG. 1, the network ID information of the second base station eBS2 needs to be known by the currently serving base station eBSi to assist the AT 104 in handoff from eBSi to eBS2.<br>
[0028]	If the network information of a neighboring base station is not known to ihe<br>
currently serving base station, configuration of the base stations with identifying information is required to provide full communication system functionalities (e.g., paging and data tunneling). Examples of such identifying information may typically include the IP address of the base station, geographical location, paging related information, topological and routing information, and a protocol interface version. In the system of FIG. 1, each base station may be configured to utilize the AT wireless communication and the attendant information transmitted wirelessly thereto by other base stations to automatically add or delete (in the case where a base station goes out-of-service) a base station from a neighbor list maintained by the base stations.<br>
[0029]	In one aspect of an automated neighbor discovery (ND), an AT 104 in the<br>
communication system 100, which is currently being served by a base station eBSt, detects a signal including identification data (e.g., a pilotlD, as well as ANID or Sector ID) 112 from a neighboring base station 110. For certain operations, such as a handoff of the AT 104 from one eBS (i.e.. the serving eBS 102) to another (e.g., eBS I 10 called the "target" eBS), as mentioned before, it is desirable for all the BSs to having information regarding each other's operating parameters and capabilities.<br>
[0030]	Accordingly,   AT    104   may   then   communicate   or   report   the   detected<br>
identification data from the transmitted identifying data 112 to the currently serving base station 102 as illustrated by communication link 114.  If the base station 102 does<br>
 <br>
not recognize the base station 110, base station 102 requests the AT 104 for the network identification information (e.g., ANID or Sector ID) concerning the unknown base station (110 in this example) as illustrated by communication link 116. At this point, the AT 104 may then respond to the request from eBSi 102 with the ANID or Sector ID information.<br>
[0031]	Once eBSi has the Sector ID information about the new base station eBS? 110, a<br>
query for one or more requested data may be issued by eBSi to the address of eBS? via (he gateway/network 106 (and communication links 108, 118) as an example. The new base station eBS2 transmits the requested information to eBS] via the gateway/network 106, with which eBSi 102 updates its neighbor list or similar data structure for keeping track of potentially viable target neighboring base stations. According to another aspect, the new base station eBS? may also initiate neighbor discovery requests to base station eBSt via the gateway/network 106, It is noted here thai the query for the one or more requested data via the gateway/network 106 is merely exemplary and not limited to such, and that this information may be exchanged through any number of various means including wireless links using the Sector ID address information.<br>
[0032]	FIG. 2 illustrates a call flow diagram of a process for neighbor discovery that<br>
may be used in the communication system of FIG. 1. As shown the call flows illustrated occur between an access terminal AT 202, a first serving base station eBS] 204, and a target base station eBS2 206. It is noted that the vertical direction of the call flow 200 represents time or sequential ordering of the messages between the various devices.<br>
[0033]	The AT 202 may detect or senses a pilot from another base station eBS2 206<br>
besides the currently serving base station eBSi 204 as illustrated by block 208. When the AT 202 detects the piiotID from the pilot of eBS2 206 (referred to hereinafter as Pilot ID2 in this example), AT 202 reports the Pilot ID2 to the currently serving eBSi 204 as indicated by message 210. If eBSi 204 does not recognize eBS2 206 based on the Pilot ID2 (which may occur when eBS2 has been newly added to the network, as air example), eBS] responds with a request message to AT 202 for the Sector ID associated with Pilot ID2 as illustrated by message 212. In response to the request 212, AT 202 then sends a response 214 to eBS, 204 with the Sector ID of pilotID2, as obtained wirelessly from the pilot transmitted by eBS2 206.<br>
 <br>
[0034]	Once the base station eBS| 204 has the Sector ID information for eBS2 206, the<br>
eBSj sends a neighbor discovery (ND) request 216 to eBS2 206 to initiate neighbor discovery procedures (e.g., obtaining protocol revision, supported AGW addresses, location, zone information, etc.). In particular, eBSi 204 may send the request 216 to eBS2 206 via an AGW or other suitable gateway/network, such as 106 in FIG. 1. In response, the eBS2 206 may send a neighbor discovery report message 218 to requesting base station eBSt 206. Additionally, the request 216 may include the pilot ID (i.e., pilotlDl) associated with eBS], wherein eBSa associates eBSi with piiotlDl. A prescribed time period 220 measured by a timer at eBSi may also be employed to ensure that the request is answered within a certain timing. The timer is stopped by receipt of a report message 218 transmitted from eBS2 to eBSi. When report message is received, eBSi 204 associates eBS2 with pilotID2 and stores the ND information of eBS2 (as well as stopping the timer, if used).<br>
[0035]	As a further alternative, the new base station eBS2 206 may send a message 222<br>
requesting ND information from eBSf 204 similar to mess,age 216 sent by eBSt 204. IN response, eBSi 204 issues a message 224 to report its ND information to eBS2 206. Additionally, eBS^ 206 may employ a timer to measure a prescribed time period 226. Thus, when eBS2 206 sends message 222, the timer is started and is subsequently stopped upon receipt of message 224.<br>
[0036]	FIG. 3 illustrates a flow diagram of a method for neighbor discovery that may be<br>
used with the system of FIG. 1. In particular, the method 300 may be implemented in a base station, such as eBSi or eBS2 as illustrated by FIGs. 1 and 2. As shown, after initialization the method 300 includes a block 302 where the base station (e.g., eBS]) receives a first message from an AT based on detecting of an identification signal by the access terminal from a first base station (e.g., eBS2) in the communication network. This process is akin to message 210 in FIG. 2, where the identification signal is the pilotlD. It is noted that the process of block 302 may be initiated by the request from the AT, such as in situations where the AT is seeking assistance to determine a viable target base station to which to hand off.<br>
[0037]	After block 302, flow proceeds to decision block 304 where a determination is<br>
made whether the first base station is a recognized base station based on the identification signal (e.g., pilotlD). This check may be accomplished by searching a neighbor table stored at the base station to determine if the pilotlD is known. If the base<br>
 <br>
station recognizes the pilotTD, no further neighbor discovery need be performed at this point and the process 300 may terminate. Alternatively, if the base station's pilotID is not known, then flow proceeds to block 306. At block 306, a second message is sent by the base station to the AT requesting a network identification, which may be garnered by the AT from pilot of the other base station. This second message of block 306 is akin to message 212 in FIG. 2, as an example, where the network identification (e.g., the SectorlD or ANID) is requested.<br>
[0038]	After block 306, flow proceeds to block 308 where the base station, in response<br>
to the request of block 306, receives a third message from the AT including network identification for the first base station. It is noted that the third message in the process of block 308 is akin to message 214 illustrated in FIG. 2, as an example, and the network identification may be the SectorlD or ANID. After receipt the network identification, the base station sends a request to the first base station for identification data particular io the first base station based on the network identification as illustrated by block 310. It is noted that the process of sending the request in block 310 based on the network identification may include, in sending the request based on the network identification, first resolving or deriving an IP address of first base station using the network identification of the first base station. It is further noted that the request may be sent over a network, such as gateway/network 106 as illustrated in FIG. 1 rather than over wireless resources, but is not limited thereto and may include various means including wireless resources.. An example of the request in block 310 is the ND request 216 in FIG. 2. Additionally, the requested identification data concerning the first base station may typically include, but is not limited to, the geographical location of the first base station, paging related information, topological and routing information, and a protocol interface version.<br>
[0039]	After the request in block 310 is sent over the network, from the standpoint of<br>
the serving base station, the process 300 for initiating neighbor discovery (ND) can be characterized as completed. However, it is intuitive that receipt of the identification data from the first base station will complete the neighbor discovery process allowing the serving base station to assist the AT in handing off to the first base station. Accordingly, a further alternative biock 312 (shown dashed) is illustrated in FIG. 3 indicating the receipt of the identification data back from the first base station and<br>
 <br>
updating of the neighbor list at the serving base station. The process of block 312 is akin to the ND Report message 218 shown in FIG. 2.<br>
[0040]	As a yet further alternative, method 300 may also include receiving a request<br>
from the first base station for neighbor information (e.g., neighbor list) known io the apparatus executing method 300 (i.e., another base station). In turn, the apparatus sends the neighbor information to the requesting first base station as illustrated by dashed block 314. It is noted that the process of block 314 is akin to the function effected by messages 222 and 224 illustrated in FIG. 2.<br>
[004/]	FIG, 4 schematically shows an exemplary implementation of an apparatus 400<br>
for executing the methodologies as described above. Apparatus 400 may be implemented in a server implemented with an eBS, as merely an example, or any other suitable apparatus. The apparatus 400 features a central data bus 402, or similar device for linking several circuits together. The circuits include a CPU (Central Processing Unit) or a controlJer 404, transceiver circuits 406, network interface circuits 408, and a memory unit 410.<br>
[0042]	The transceiver circuits 406 include receiver circuits to process received signals<br>
before sending out to the central data bus 402, as well as transmit circuits to process and buffer data from the data bus 402 before sending out of the device 400, such as to an AT as illustrated, Additionally in the case where apparatus 400 is employed in a base station, the transceiver circuits 406 may include RF circuits to transmit over a wireless link 410 to one or more AT's.<br>
[0043]	The CPU/controller 404 performs the function of data management of the data<br>
bus 402 and further the function of general data processing, including executing the instructional contents of the memory unit 410. It is noted here that instead of separately implemented as shown in FIG. 4, as an alternative, the transceiver circuits 406 can be incorporated as parts of the CPU/controller 404. As a further alternative, the entire apparatus 400 may be implemented as an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) or similar apparatus.<br>
[0044]	The memory unit 410 may include one or more sets of instructions/modules. In<br>
the exemplary apparatus 400, the instructions/modules include, among other things, a neighbor discovery (ND) function 414, which is configured to effect the methodologies described herein.  Memory unit 410 may further include a neighbor list 416 or similar<br>
 <br>
data construct that stores, among other things, the identification data of neighboring data or references other storage with the at least a portion of the identification data.<br>
[0045]	In the example of FIG. 4, the memory unit 410 may be a RAM (Random Access<br>
Memory) circuit. The exemplary portions, such as the function 414, are software routines, modules and/or data sets. The memory unit 410 can be tied to another memory circuit (not shown) which either can be of the volatile or nonvolatile type. As an alternative, the memory unit 410 can be made of other circuit types, such as an EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory), an EPROM (Electrical Programmable Read Only Memory), a ROM (Read Only Memory), an ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit), a magnetic disk, an optical disk, and other computer-readable media well known in the art.<br>
f0046]	It is further noted that the network interface circuits 408 may be used to effect<br>
neighbor discovery functions, such as communication with a gateway/network 418. which is similar to gateway/network 106. In particular, the circuits 408 may be used to transmit and receive messages for obtaining identification data from other apparatus in the communication network 418 for, among other things, neighbor discovery.<br>
[0047]	FIG. 5 illustrates a flow diagram of an exemplary methodology that may be<br>
effected by an AT or similar device for neighbor discovery of base stations in a network. As shown, the method 500 includes a block 502 where the AT detects an identification signal from a first base station in the communication. This detection may include detecting the pilot channel of the first base station, and the identification signal may include the pilotID of the first base station. An example of this detection is illustrated by block 208 in FIG. 2. After detection of the identification signal, the AT then transmits a request to a second base station to assist AT to hand off to the first base station based on the identification signal as illustrated by block 504. It is noted that this message request is akin to the report message 210 illustrated by FIG. 2.<br>
[00481	After the message in block 504 is transmitted, the second base station will<br>
determine if the first base station is known in the communication network, If not. the second base station will transmit a message to the AT requesting network identification information concerning the first base station. Hence, from the standpoint of the AT, the AT receives the message from the second base station when the second base station detennines that the first base station is not a known base station, where the message requests network  identification data from the AT concerning first base station as<br>
 <br>
illustrated by block 506. Ii is noted thai the process of block 506 may be exemplified by the request 212 in FIG. 2, and the network identification data may include a SectorlD or ANID for the first base station.<br>
[00491	After the process of block 506, the method 500 proceeds to block 508 where the<br>
AT obtains the network identification data (e.g., the Sector ID). As explained earlier the pilot signal broadcast by the first base station (e.g., 112 in FIG. 1) will include this data. Thus, the AT then obtains the network identification data from the pilot signal, for example and then transmits the network identification data to the second base station as illustrated by block 510. The process of block 510 is akin to the SectorlD response 214 shown in FIG. 2. The second base station may then utilize the network identification data to initiate ND procedures to register the first base station and add the first base station to its list of known neighbors as discussed previously with respect to FIGs. 2 and 3, for example.<br>
[0050]	FIG. 6 illustrates an exemplary apparatus 600 that may be utilized to effect the<br>
methodology of FIG. 5. It is noted that apparatus 600 may constitute an AT or other suitable hardware (e.g., processor, or a collection of circuits/modules) for use in an AT device. As illustrated, the apparatus 600 includes a central data bus 602, or similar device for linking several circuits together. The circuits include a CPU (Central Processing Unit) or a controller 604, transceiver circuits 606, network, and a memory unit 608.<br>
[0051]	The transceiver circuits 606 include receiver circuits to process received signals<br>
before sending out to the central data bus 602, as well as transmit circuits to process and ■ buffer data from the data bus 602 before sending out of the device 600, such as to one or more eBS's as illustrated by wireless communication link(s) 610. Accordingly, the transceiver circuits 606 may include RF circuits to transmit over the wireless link 610 to the one or more eBS's.<br>
[0052]	The CPU/controller 606 performs the function of data management of the data<br>
bus 602 and further the function of general data processing, including executing the instructional contents of the memory unit 410. It is noted here that instead of separately implemented as shown in FIG. 6, as an alternative, the transceiver circuits 606 can be incorporated as parts of the CPU/controller 604. As a further alternative, the entire apparatus 600 may be implemented as an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) or similar apparatus.     The memory  unit 610  may  include one  or more sets  of<br>
 <br>
instructions/modules. In the exemplary apparatus 600, the instructions/modules include, among other things, a neighbor discovery (ND) function 612, which is configured to effect the methodologies described herein; namely FIG. 5.<br>
[0053]	In the example of FIG. 6, the memory unit 610 may be a RAM (Random Access<br>
Memory) circuit. The exemplary portions, such as the function 414, are software routines, modules and/or data sets. The memory unit 610 can be tied to another memory circuit (not shown) which either can be of the volatile or nonvolatile type. As an alternative, the memory unit 610 can be made of other circuit types, such as an EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory), an EPROM (Electrical Programmable Read Only Memory), a ROM (Read Only Memory), an ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit), a magnetic disk, an optical disk, and other computer-readable media well known in the art.<br>
[0054]	FIG. 7 illustrates another example of a communication system 700 utilizing<br>
neighbor discovery. In this example, it is contemplated that a base station (eBS) may include an integrated and dedicated AT unit used for ND procedures rather than an arbitrary AT currently being served by the base station. As may be seen in FIG. 7, base station eBSt 702 incorporates an AT 704. The AT 704 within the eBS, 702 detects or receives the pilot signal 706 from another neighboring base station (e.g., eBS2 708) in much the same way as the AT 104 discussed in connection with FIG. 1. It is noted, however, that the AT 704 must be within wireless reception range of another eBS (e.g., eBSo 708) in order to effectively accomplish ND procedures. After detection of a pilot signal, the interaction of the AT 704 with other elements of base station 702 is carried out in the same manner as discussed previously with respect to FIGs. 2, 4, and 5 to accomplish ND over the gateway/network 710 and accompanying links 712 and 714.<br>
[0055]	It is also noted that the eBS,  and AT in the example of FIG. 7 may be<br>
implemented with apparatus similar to those described herein with respect to FIGs. 4 and 6, It is further noted that elements of the apparatus 400 and 600 may overlap and could be consolidated into a singular unit with modules or circuits configured to perform the methods of FIGs. 3 and 5.<br>
[0056]	FIG. 8 illustrates yet another example of a communication system 800 utilizing<br>
neighbor discovery. In the example of FIG. 8, a first base station eBSi 802 serves an AT 804 over a wireless link 806. An area 808 where the AT 804 may be presently located in this example is a coverage area where communication services (e.g.. voice.<br>
 <br>
paging, etc.) may be served by any one of one or more other neighboring base stations,<br>
such as eBSo 810 and eBS2 812. In the example of FIG. 8, it is assumed for illustration<br>
that eBSo 810 is a known neighbor to eBSi 802, and thus that eBS0 810 is part of the<br>
neighbor list for eBS]. When a new base station, namely eBS2 812, is added to the<br>
neighbor list of base station eBSi 802 through the methodologies discussed previously,<br>
base station eBS] may be configured to, in turn, update neighboring base stations such<br>
as eBSo 810 which potentially serve the same coverage area 808. Accordingly, eBSt<br>
802 would communicate the identification data concerning eBS2 812 received from<br>
eBS2 via ND procedures. This communication may be effected via the<br>
gateway/network 814 and associated communications links 816 and 818. Accordingly,<br>
the new or updated neighbor list of eBS] 802 (which would include eBSo and eBS2) is<br>
communicated to eBSo 810 to update its neighbor list. Similarly, eBSi could also<br>
communicate its updated neighbor list to newly discovered eBS2 812 via the<br>
gateway/network 814 and associated communications links 816 and 820.<br>
[00571	U is noted that there may exist instances during ND procedures where the<br>
identification signal or network identification of a newly added base station conflicts with an existing neighboring base station's identification signal or network identification, In such cases, the base station performing ND procedures may be configured to mediate the conflict. Using system 800 in FIG. 8, for illustration purposes, if the AT 804 detects or receives a pilot signal 822 with a pilotID from new base station eBS2 812, using the previously described ND methods, the AT 804 will communicate the pilotID to the serving base station (i.e., eBSi 802). If the serving base station delects a conflict with an existing pilotID, such as the pilot ID of neighboring base station eBSo 810, for example, the serving base station eBSi 802 can initiate mediation. The mediation may consist of the serving base station communicating via gateway/network 814 to the neighboring base stations 810 and 812 to issue a request to at least one of base station 8)0 or 812 to change its respective pilotID. This mediation procedure may be implemented in any number of suitable manners know to those skilled in art. The mediation process may also involve initiating registration of the new base station 812 and communication of updated information to all base stations in its current neighbor list. Furthermore, the updated pilot ID information may be communicated to the AT 804 actively by the serving base station over the wireless link 806, or alternatively via continued detection or reception of the pilot signal 822 by the<br>
 <br>
AT 804 in a somewhat more passive manner. It is noted that the mediation functionality may be implemented by the neighbor discovery function 414 disclosed in FIG. 4, as an example.<br>
[0058]	FIG. 9 illustrates an apparatus 900 for use in a communication system that may<br>
be utilized for neighbor discovery of base stations. The apparatus 900, which may be implemented in a base station, for example, includes a module 902 for receiving a first message from an access terminal to assist the access terminal to handoff to a first base station from a second base station based on detecting of an identification signal by the access terminal from the first base station in the communication network. The information received by module 902 may then be communicated to various other modules in apparatus 900 via a bus 904, or similar suitable communication coupling. In particular, the first message and/or identification signal may be communicated to a module 906 for determining whether the first base station is a known base station based on the identification signal.<br>
[0059]	Apparatus 900 further includes a module 908 for transmitting a second<br>
message to the access terminal requesting a network identification of the first base station when a determination is made that the first base station is not a known base station, such as by module 906. Apparatus 900 also includes a module 910 for receiving a third message from the access terminal in response to the second message sent by module 908, for example, wherein the third message includes the network identification of the first base station. A module 912 is also featured for sending a request for identification data to the first base station based on the network identification received by module 910. In addition, the apparatus 900 may include an optional computer readable medium or memory device 914 configured to store computer readable instructions and data for effecting the processes and behavior of either the modules. Additionally, apparatus 900 may include a processor 916 to execute the computer readable instructions in memory 914, and may be configured to execute one or more functions of the various modules in apparatus 900.<br>
[0060]	FIG. 10 illustrates an apparatus 1000 for use in a communication system that<br>
may be utilized for neighbor discovery of base stations, The apparatus 1000, which may be implemented in an access terminal, for example, includes a module 1002 for detecting an identification signal from a first base station in the communication network at  an  access terminal.    The information received  by  module   1002  may  then  be<br>
 <br>
communicated to various other modules in apparatus 1000 via a bus 1004. or other similar suitable communication coupling. In particular, the identification signal may be communicated to a module 1006 for transmitting a request to a second base station to assist the access terminal to hand off to the first base station based on the identification signal.<br>
[0061]	Apparatus 1000 further includes a module 3008 for receiving a message from<br>
the second base station when the second base station determines that the first base station is not a known base station to request identification data of the first base station. A module 1010 is also included for obtaining the identification data from the first base station, as wel! as a module 1012 for then transmitting the identification data to the second base station, Also, the apparatus 1000 may include an optional computer readable medium or memory device 1014 configured to store computer readable instructions and data for effecting the processes and behavior of either the modules. Additionally, apparatus 1000 may include a processor 1016 to execute the computer readable instructions in memory 1014, and may be configured to execute one or more functions of the various modules in apparatus 1000.<br>
