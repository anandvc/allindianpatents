The circuit comprises a floating gate semiconductor device having a floating gate, a control gate, a drain and a source. The circuit also employs a photosensitive semiconductor device that is positioned for exposure to electromagnetic radiation from an image.

The pixel control circuit may also direct the floating gate semiconductor device and the photosensitive semiconductor device to further modes including a read mode and a data retention mode. In the read mode, current flow between the source and drain of the floating gate semiconductor device is detected as an indicator of the charge on the floating gate. In the data retention mode, the charge on the floating gate of the floating gate semiconductor device that was acquired during the exposure mode is maintained notwithstanding further exposure of the photosensitive semiconductor device to the electromagnetic radiation from the image.

IMAGE SENSOR ARCHITECTURE EMPLOYING ONE OR MORE<br>
FLOATING GATE DEVICES<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The present invention is generally directed to image sensor<br>
technology. More particularly, the present invention includes an image sensor<br>
architecture employing one or more floating gate devices.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	CMOS and CCD image sensors have found a wide range of<br>
applications in both consumer and industrial products. Such applications include<br>
stand-alone digital cameras, night time driving displays for automobiles, computer<br>
peripherals, integrated cell phone cameras, etc.<br>
[0003]	Mobile technology has traditionally focused on the use of CMOS<br>
image sensors for image capture. Consumer expectations, however, have driven<br>
the market to use high-resolution CMOS image sensor arrays thereby giving rise<br>
to a number of problems to the image sensor developer. First, size constraints<br>
imposed by mobile technologies require a greater number of pixels per unit area of<br>
the array. Pixel size must therefore be decreased in comparison to traditional<br>
CMOS pixels. Such decreases in pixel size result in a corresponding reduction in<br>
the dynamic range and sensitivity of the pixel. Second, image readout time from<br>
such high-resolution image sensor arrays increases with the number of pixels<br>
employed in the array. To reduce image degradation resulting from this increase<br>
in readout time, an electronic global shutter mechanism should be employed.<br>
Pixels employing an electronic global shutter, however, require a large number of<br>
components resulting in a corresponding reduction of the pixel fill factor.<br>
Accordingly, the present inventors have found a need in the industry for an<br>
improved pixel architecture that addresses one or more of these shortcomings.<br>

PCT/US2006/019724<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0014]	Fig. 1 illustrates an image acquisition system, shown generally at<br>
60, that employs an image array 65 comprising a plurality of pixel circuits 70<br>
constructed in accordance with one exemplary embodiment of the present<br>
invention. As shown, the pixel circuits 70 are arranged in the array 65 in a<br>
plurality of rows and columns. Each row of pixel circuits 70 may be individually<br>
addressed and, if desired, the output signals from an activated row may be read<br>
concurrently.<br>
[0015]	In this exemplary embodiment, electromagnetic radiation 75 from<br>
an image source is directed through a lens 80 and array overlay 85 onto<br>
photosensitive components of the individual pixel circuits 70. Array overlay 85<br>
may be constructed so that selected pixels are only exposed to certain wavelengths<br>
within the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation 75. For example, array overlay<br>
85 may selectively expose predetermined pixels 70 in the array 65 solely to red,<br>
green or blue light pursuant to generating a color image.<br>
[0016]	A row selection circuit 90 is used to activate the readout of the pixel<br>
circuits 70 in a given row of the image array 65. The output signals from the pixel<br>
circuits 70 in the activated row are provided to a column read circuit 95. Column<br>
read circuit 95 may be constructed in any number of different manners. For<br>
example, column read circuit 95 may comprise a single correlated double<br>
sampling (CDS) circuit that selectively reads individual columns of the array 65<br>
when a single row of the array is selected through the row selection circuit 90. In<br>
an alternate exemplary embodiment, a plurality of CDS circuits may be used so<br>
that each column of the array 65 (or even fewer than all columns) may be<br>
concurrently read by a respective CDS circuit. In other exemplary embodiments,<br>
circuits providing a single readout from each pixel circuit 70 during a single read<br>
cycle may be employed thereby negating the need for CDS circuitry. Preferably,<br>
the analog signals from the pixel circuits 70 are converted by the column read<br>
circuit 95 to a digital format which is then arranged into an image frame by a<br>

PCT/US2006/019724<br><br>
frame grabber 100. Timing for the various operations executed by system 60 is<br>
preferably coordinated by a clock and timing generator circuit 105 or the like.<br>
Frame grabber 100 may itself execute a number of image processing routines (i.e.,<br>
image compression, enhancement, etc.) or provide image data at output 114<br>
processing by one or more further systems.<br>
[0017]	One embodiment of a pixel circuit 70 suitable for use in the image<br>
array 65 of system 60 is shown in Fig. 2. Generally stated, pixel circuit 70 is<br>
comprised of a floating gate semiconductor device 115, a photosensitive<br>
semiconductor device 117 and a pixel control circuit 120. The floating gate<br>
semiconductor device 115 includes a drain 125, a source 130, a control gate 135<br>
and a floating gate 140. In the illustrated exemplary embodiment, the<br>
photosensitive semiconductor device 117 may be a pinned photodiode that is<br>
positioned for exposure to electromagnetic radiation from an image that is to be<br>
detected. The photodiode 117 of the illustrated exemplary embodiment includes an<br>
anode 145 and a cathode 150.<br>
[0018]	The pixel control circuit 120 is connected to direct the floating gate<br>
semiconductor device 115 and the photodiode 117 to a plurality of controlled<br>
modes. These controlled modes include at least an erase mode and an exposure<br>
mode. In the erase mode, at least a portion of an electric charge is removed from<br>
the floating gate 140 of the floating gate semiconductor device 115. The voltage<br>
across photodiode 117 may also be raised while in the erase mode. In this manner,<br>
both the floating gate semiconductor device 115 and photodiode 117 are placed in<br>
an initialized state.<br>
[0019]	In the exposure mode, the floating gate 140 of the floating gate<br>
semiconductor device 115 is charged at least partially in response to a voltage at a<br>
terminal of the photosensitive semiconductor device 117. In the illustrated<br>
exemplary embodiment, the floating gate 140 is charged at least partially in<br>
response to. the voltage at the anode 145 of photodiode 117. The voltage at anode<br>
145 is dependent on the degree to which photodiode 117 is exposed to the<br>
electromagnetic radiation from the image source. More particularly, there will be a<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2007/001688<br><br>
PCT/US2006/019724<br><br>
voltage drop across photodiode 117 that corresponds to the electromagnetic<br>
radiation exposure. The greater the exposure that photodiode 117 experiences, the<br>
greater the voltage drop that will occur across photodiode 117 thereby reducing<br>
the voltage at control gate 135.<br>
[0020]	Pixel control circuit 120 may also direct photodiode 117 and<br>
floating gate semiconductor device 115 to a data retention mode. In the data<br>
retention mode, the charge on the floating gate 140 acquired during the exposure<br>
mode is maintained. Notably, the charge on the floating gate 140 remains<br>
generally constant even though the voltage drop across photodiode 117 may<br>
change. For example, once the floating gate 140 has been charged during the<br>
exposure mode, the charge may be maintained on the floating gate 140 almost<br>
indefinitely even if the photodiode 117 continues to be exposed to electromagnetic<br>
radiation from the image source.<br>
[0021]	Pixel control circuit 120 may also direct photodiode 117 and<br>
floating gate semiconductor device 115 to a read mode to effectively sense the<br>
charge placed on floating gate 140 during the exposure mode. In the illustrated<br>
exemplary embodiment, the charge on floating gate 140 alters the threshold<br>
voltage Vj of the floating gate semiconductor device 115. Consequently, a<br>
predetermined voltage VGS may be provided between the control gate 135 and<br>
source 130 of the floating gate semiconductor device 115 to produce a current 155<br>
between the drain 125 and source 130 that corresponds to the charge on floating<br>
gate 140.<br>
[0022]	As shown, pixel control circuit 120 may include a transistor switch<br>
160 and a diode 165. Transistor switch 160 may be a field effect transistor, such<br>
as a MOSFET or the like, having a drain 170, source 175 and control gate 180.<br>
Control gate 180 is connected to receive a row read signal from, for example, row<br>
selection circuit 90 of Fig. 1. The drain 170 and source 175 of MOSFET 160 are<br>
respectively connected to the cathode 150 and anode 145 of photodiode 117.<br>
Diode 165 includes an anode 180 that is connected to a node 182 that includes the<br>
source 175 of MOSFET 160 and the control gate 135 of floating gate<br>
5<br><br>
WO 2007/001688<br><br>
PCT/US2006/019724<br><br>
semiconductor device 115. Diode 165 also includes a cathode 185 that is<br>
connected to receive a reset/erase signal. Various components used to generate<br>
the operating voltage levels at the drain 170, drain 125 and source 130 are not<br>
illustrated in Fig. 3 but are well within the design capabilities of those skilled in<br>
the art given the detailed description of the various controlled modes set forth<br>
herein.<br>
[0023]	Figs. 3 through 6 show the pixel architecture 70 of Fig. 2 in the<br>
various modes of operation discussed above. Exemplary voltage levels for<br>
operating in these modes are identified. However, it will be recognized that the<br>
specific voltage levels required to operate the pixel architecture 70 in the various<br>
modes will depend on the characteristics of the individual devices that are<br>
employed.<br>
[0024]	Fig. 3 shows the pixel architecture 70 in the erase mode of<br>
operation. In this mode, drains 170 and 125 as well as source 130 are driven to +8<br>
V while the row read signal at gate 180 and the reset/erase signal at cathode 185<br>
are driven to -8 V. This places floating gate semiconductor 115 and MOSFET 160<br>
into non-conductive states so that current 155 and current 195 are approximately<br>
zero. The diode 165 is forward biased to discharge floating gate 140. At least a<br>
portion of the resulting discharge current is depicted at arrow 200. Additionally,<br>
photodiode 117 is charged to an initial state with a voltage drop of approximately<br>
15.2 VDC thereacross.<br>
[0025]	Fig. 4 shows the pixel architecture 70 in the exposure mode of<br>
operation. In this mode, drain 125 and cathode 185 are driven to +8 V while the<br>
row read signal at gate 180 and source 130 are driven to 0 V. This places<br>
MOSFET 160 and diode 165 into non-conductive states so that current 195 and<br>
current 200 are approximately zero. Additionally, the voltage levels at drain 170<br>
and cathode 150 are elevated to a "programming voltage" of+12 V. Photodiode<br>
117 is exposed to electromagnetic radiation 75 which causes a corresponding<br>
voltage drop between the cathode 150 and anode 145. The voltage at control gate<br>
135 reflects this voltage drop and thus corresponds to the amount of<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2007/001688<br><br>
PCT/US2006/019724<br><br>
electromagnetic radiation detected at photodiode 117. This control gate voltage, in<br>
turn, determines the amount of charge placed on floating gate 140 during the<br>
exposure mode.<br>
[0026]	Fig. 5 shows the pixel architecture 70 in the data retention mode of<br>
operation. In this mode, drain 125 and cathode 185 are driven to +8 V while the<br>
row read signal at gate 180 and source 130 are driven to 0 V. This places<br>
MOSFET 160 and diode 165 into non-conductive states so that current 195 and<br>
current 200 are approximately zero. The voltage level at cathode 150 of<br>
photodiode 117 is reduced to +8 V thereby inhibiting further accumulation of<br>
charge on the floating gate 140. Still further, drain 125 is open circuited or<br>
otherwise connected to a high impedance load to prevent current flow through the<br>
floating gate semiconductor device 115. Current 155 is therefore approximately<br>
zero. In this state, the charge on floating gate 140 can remain relatively constant<br>
over a prolonged period of time. Since the charge on floating gate 140 can be<br>
retained within the individual pixel circuits 70 of the image array 65, the image<br>
processing requirements imposed on peripheral circuits, if any, can be relaxed.<br>
The cost and complexity of any such image processing peripheral circuits can<br>
therefore be reduced, if desired.<br>
[0027]	Fig. 6 shows the pixel architecture 70 in the read mode of operation.<br>
In this mode, drains 170 and 125, gate 180 and cathode 185 are driven to +8 V<br>
while the source 130 is driven to 0 V. This places control gate 135 at a fixed<br>
voltage of approximately +8 V with respect to source 130. As such, VGS is<br>
approximately +8 V and the current 155 proceeding through the pixel output<br>
corresponds to the charge on floating gate 140. Conversion of current 155 into an<br>
appropriate digital signal may take place in the column read circuit 95, which may<br>
be implemented in any number of different manners as understood by those of<br>
ordinary skill in the art.<br>
[0028]	The pixel architecture 70 is easily implemented in a monolithic<br>
substrate. More particularly, the pixel architecture 70 may be readily<br>
manufactured using existing CMOS manufacturing processes to form the image<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2007/001688<br><br>
PCT/US2006/019724<br><br>
array 65 shown in Fig. 1. An exemplary plan layout for the components of pixel<br>
architecture 70 in a monolithic substrate is illustrated in Fig. 7. It will be<br>
recognized, however, that other layouts may be employed. Further, any of the<br>
peripheral components, such as row selection circuit 90, column read circuit 95,<br>
frame grabber 100 and clocking and timing generator 105 of Fig. 1 may likewise<br>
be integrated with the image array 65 in a monolithic substrate.<br>
[0029]	Because pixel architecture 70 is centered about a floating gate<br>
semiconductor device 115, the pixel, including the components necessary to<br>
implement the global reset function, can be implemented with fewer components<br>
when compared to a 5T pixel architecture. In the specific pixel circuit architecture<br>
shown in Fig. 2, only two transistors 115 and 160 and a single diode 165 are used<br>
in conjunction with photodiode 117 thereby facilitating a 2T1D structure. By<br>
employing a floating gate semiconductor device 115, it becomes possible to place<br>
the pixel circuit 70 into various controlled modes by manipulating the voltage<br>
levels provided to the pixel circuit components as opposed to adding further<br>
switching transistors to achieve the same operations.<br>
[0030]	The reduction in the number of components employed to implement<br>
the pixel circuit 70 can be used to achieve any number of different objectives. For<br>
example, pixel circuit 70 may be manufactured so that its fill factor is comparable<br>
to conventional 3T CMOS image sensor architectures. Further, circuit 70 can be<br>
implemented so that it has a much higher sensitivity and larger dynamic range<br>
when compared with 4T and 5T CMOS image sensor architectures. As disclosed<br>
herein, the pixel circuit 70 may employ higher operating voltages during the<br>
exposure mode thereby improving the performance of photodiode 117 and<br>
rendering it comparable to the performance of similar CCD image sensors.<br>
[0031]	Pixel circuit 70 may also be implemented so that the read mode of<br>
operation is similar to the readout methods employed in conventional CMOS<br>
image sensors. For example, each pixel circuit 70 may be individually addressed<br>
to achieve the same windowing and sub-sampling advantages that exist in<br>
conventional CMOS sensors thereby obviating the need for substantial redesign of<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2007/001688<br><br>
PCT/US2006/019724<br><br>
corresponding peripheral readout components. Further, the floating gate<br>
semiconductor device 115 does not have charge leakage issue and it does not have<br>
charge recombination issues as a result of under visible light illumination. Thus it<br>
does not have the fading issues associated with the 5T CMOS architecture.<br>
[0032]	One embodiment of a cellular phone 205 that may include a camera<br>
that employs the image acquisition system 60 is shown in Figs. 8 and 9. As shown,<br>
phone 205 includes a camera system 210, a keyboard 215, control keys 220 and a<br>
display 225. As noted above, image acquisition system 60 receives<br>
electromagnetic radiation from the image source through lens 80. The acquired<br>
image can be provided to an on-board image processing system 230 or directly to<br>
display 225 (i.e., for viewfinder functionality, etc.). Processed images may be<br>
stored in image storage 235 and provided to display 225 in response to user<br>
commands. Further, the images in image storage 235 may be read out therefrom<br>
for provision to a personal computer or the like via communication link 240.<br>
[0033]	Numerous modifications may be made to the foregoing system<br>
without departing from the basic teachings thereof. Although the present<br>
invention has been described in substantial detail with reference to one or more<br>
specific embodiments, those of skill in the art will recognize that changes may be<br>
made thereto without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as set<br>
forth in the appended claims.<br>

A circuit for use in an image sensor as well as an image sensing system using the circuit are set forth. The circuit comprises a floating gate semiconductor device having a floating<br>
gate, a control gate, a drain and a source. The circuit also employs a photosensitive semiconductor device that is positioned for exposure to electromagnetic radiation from an image. A pixel control circuit is connected to these components to direct the floating gate<br>
semiconductor device and the photosensitive semiconductor device to a plurality of controlled modes. The controlled modes may<br>
include an erase mode and an exposure mode. In the erase mode, at least a portion of an electric charge is removed from the floating<br>
gate to place the floating gate semiconductor device in an initialized state. In the exposure mode, the floating gate is charged at<br>
least partially in response to a voltage at a terminal of the photosensitive semiconductor device. The voltage at the terminal of the<br>
photosensitive semiconductor device corresponds to exposure of the photosensitive semiconductor device to the electromagnetic<br>
radiation from the image. The pixel control circuit may also direct the floating gate semiconductor device and the photosensitive<br>
semiconductor device to further modes including a read mode and a data retention mode. In the read mode, current flow between the source and drain of the floating gate semiconductor device is detected as an indicator of the charge on the floating gate. In the data retention mode, the charge on the floating gate of the floating<br>
gate semiconductor device that was acquired during the exposure mode is maintained notwithstanding further exposure of the photosensitive semiconductor device to the electromagnetic radiation from the image. The circuit, and one or more peripheral support circuits, may be implemented in a monolithic substrate using, for example, conventional CMOS manufacturing processes.<br></td>
