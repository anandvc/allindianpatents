DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
As shown in Figures 1 to 4 there is a constructional panel in the form of a metal<br>
roof panel 10. The roof panel 10 is suitable for cladding a roof although it should<br>
be appreciated that it extends to other applications, for. example, wall cladding.<br>
The metal roof panel 10 is elongate and in this example comprises four<br>
longitudinally extending and equally spaced apart rib formations 12/14/16/18.<br>
Adjacent pairs of the longitudinal rib formations such as 12 and 14 are<br>
interconnected by a pan 20. The intermediate longitudinal rib formations 14 and<br>
16 of this embodiment are in cross-section generally trapezium shaped. The<br>
longitudinal ribs 12 and 18 located at opposing longitudinal edge margins of the<br>
roof panel 10 are designed to interlock with a corresponding edge rib of an<br>
adjacent roof panel (not shown). The interlocking longitudinal edge ribs are<br>
together, in cross-section shaped substantially identical to one of the<br>
intermediate longitudinal rib formations such as 14.The longitudinal rib<br>
formations 12/14/16/18 are similar in construction to those of the applicant's<br>
roof cladding commercially available in Australia under the trade mark<br>
KLZP-LOK.	<br>
As shown in Figure 5 the pans such as 20 each include a plurality of<br>
transversely extending and spaced, apart microflutes such as 22. The<br>
microflutes 22 of this example are in the form of substantially parallel and<br>
spaced apart groove and ridge formations such as 23 and 25, respectively. The<br>
depth from ridge peak to groove root is about 0.5mm and the pitch from ridge<br>
peak to adjacent ridge peak is around 10mm. The groove and ridge formations<br>
are of a substantially V-shaped-and inverted V-shaped cross-section,<br>
respectively. Although not clearly illustrated in Figure 5, the groove and ridge<br>
formations 23 and 25 have rounded peaks and nadirs, respectively.<br>
Accordingly, it is the rounded peaks and nadirs only of the pan 24 which is<br>
plastically deformed to form the microflutes 22. The exaggerated representation<br>
of one of the microflutes is not to scale but depicts the depth from ridge peak to<br><br>
groove root as "D", and the pitch from ridge peak to adjacent ridge peak as "P".<br>
The microflutes such as 22 of this embodiment provide stiffening to the<br>
otherwise unstable pan such as 20. This is an advantage where for example the<br>
roof panel 10 is fabricated from relatively thin gauge strip steel, for example<br>
0.42, 0.48 or 0.60 mm gauge strip steel. Thus, the width of the pan 20 or<br>
distance between longitudinal rib formations such as 12 and 14 can be<br>
increased whilst the rigidity of the pan 20 is maintained. However, particularly in<br>
the context of roof panels, the transverse microflutes such as 22 should be of a<br>
reduced height to width ratio in order to minimise the retention of water, soil or<br>
foliage. The microflutes 22 are also designed for aesthetic reasons to provide<br>
an attractive and "natural" appearance.<br>
Traditionally the roll forming of crests and troughs in profiled panels results in<br>
what is known as "oil canning" where the surface of the material is distorted by<br>
stretching of the sheet metal. It has been found in the present application that<br>
formation of the transverse micro flutes in the panel substantially eliminates the<br>
likelihood of "oil canning" by substantially removing the stretch in the pan.<br>
Figure 6 is a graph of load versus deflection for the metal roof panel 10 of the<br>
preceding embodiments. The load is in Newtons and intended to be<br>
representative of typical uplift loads on roof cladding panels as a result of wind<br>
forces. The deflection is in millimetres and is the maximum deflection of the pan<br>
such as 20 from a flat plain under the various uplifting forces. The various plots<br>
of Figure 6 include load/deflection tests for:<br>
(a)	a commercially available roofing panel;<br>
(b)	the applicants panel commercially available<br>
under the trade mark KLIP-LOK; <br>
(c)	the metal roof panel 10 of the described<br>
embodiment; and<br>
(d)	a KLIP-LOK panel but with relatively large<br>
transverseJIutes.	J-~~~~~^~~^~~<br><br>
That is, plot (c) relates to the described embodiment of the present invention<br>
whereas plots (a), (b) and (d) relate to conventional or comparative<br>
constructional panels. It is readily apparent that the preferred embodiment<br>
including the transverse microflutes provides increased loadings for the same<br>
deflection as the conventional or comparative examples. For example, the<br>
microfluted panel requires 70 Newtons (N) to deflect 40mm whereas the<br>
conventional panels of plots (a) and (b) required about 60 N. This represents an<br>
increase in stiffness of around 150.<br>
Figure 7 is a schematic and exaggerated illustration of a constructional panel<br>
such as the metal roofing panel 10 of the preceding embodiment when mounted<br>
to a roof structure or like via concealed fixing clips such as 26 and 28. The solid<br>
line of the pan 20 of the panel 10 is in its unloaded condition whereas the<br>
broken line represents the pan 20 when deflected under wind pressure. It will<br>
be apparent that the deflected pan 20 in this condition has dislodged from the<br>
concealed clips 26 and 28. The load required to dislodge a constructional panel<br>
including the transverse microflutes of the present invention is significantly<br>
higher than that of conventional or comparative roof panels as illustrated and<br>
explained in the context of the graph of Figure 6. Therefore, the metal roof<br>
panel such as 10 including the transverse microflutes is less susceptible to<br>
dislodgment from the concealed clips or other mounting means.<br>
The pan such as 20 of the roof panel 10 shown in Figure 1 includes a generally<br>
flat strip such as 24 formed at each of its opposing longitudinal edge portions.<br>
The flat strip such as 24 extends alongside the adjacent longitudinal<br>
strengthening rib formation 12 and is generally at a level of the grooves formed<br>
by the transverse microflutes 22. Thus, the flat strips such as 24 provide run-off<br>
for any water or other matter which may have collected in the grooves or<br>
troughs of the transverse ribs 22. In this example the flat strips such as 24<br>
occupy about 10% of the pan 20.<br>
It should be appreciated that the dimensions of the constructional panel and for<br>
example the height of the longitudinal rib formations relative to the width of the<br><br>
pan may vary but still remain within the scope of the present invention.<br>
However, in this embodiment the ratio of the height of the rib formations such<br>
as 12 and 14 to the width of the intermediate pan 20 is about 1:4. This<br>
corresponds to a longitudinal rib height of about 43 mm and a pan width of<br>
about 175 mm.<br>
The general steps involved in forming the metal roof panel 10 described-above<br>
will now be outlined:<br>
(i) longitudinal rib formations such as 14 are roll<br>
formed in strip metal; and<br>
(ii) transversely extending microflutes are roll formed in a pan defined<br>
between adjacent pairs of rib formations in the roof panel.<br>
The longitudinal rib formations and microflutes such as 12 and 22, respectively<br>
will generally be cold roll formed in strip steel. The longitudinal rib formations<br>
such as 14 and transverse microflutes 22 are formed sequentially. The strip<br>
steel is generally provided with a corrosion resistant coating.<br>
Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the invention described herein is<br>
susceptible to variations and modifications other than those specifically<br>
described. For example, the constructional panel may include longitudinal rib<br>
formations at its opposing edge margins only. The transverse microflutes may<br>
vary in cross-sectional profile and unlike the described embodiment extend the<br>
full width of the pan. The constructional panel may be partly or entirely<br>
constructed of a plastics material. All such variations and modifications are to<br>
be considered within the scope of the present invention the nature of which is to<br>
be determined from the foregoing description.<br>
In the preceding summary of the invention, except where the context requires<br>
otherwise due to express language or necessary implication, the word<br>
"comprising" is used in the sense of "including", that is the features specified<br>
may be associated with further features in various embodiments of the<br>
invention.<br><br>
