				<td>PROCESS FOR THE RESOLUTION OF HOMOCYSTEINE-?-<br>
THIOLACTONE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the preparation of enantiomerically<br>
pure 2-amino-4-mercaptobutyric acid 1,4-thiolactone.<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
2-Amino-4-mercaptobutyric acid 1,4-thiolactone, commonly referred to<br>
as homocysteine-?-thiolactone (hereinafter indicated as HCT) I:<br><br>
contains a chiral carbon atom, denoted with a *, and thus exists in the<br>
form of two distinct enantiomers, the R- and the S-enantiomer. The racemate<br>
is commercially available and is usually sold in the form of its hydrochloride<br>
salt.<br>
A first known method for the preparation of enantiomerically pure HCT<br>
comprises the demethylation of enantiomerically pure methionine, to obtain<br>
enantiomerically pure homocysteine and then closing the lactone ring, thus<br>
obtaining enantiomerically pure HCT. This method is costly and difficult to<br>
carry out on an industrial scale.<br>
Another method for the preparation of enantiomerically pure HCT is<br>
disclosed in JP 2001-199980 and JP 2000-351776, wherein racemic HCT is<br>
reacted with an enantiomerically pure acid to form two diastereomeric amides;<br>
the diastereoisomers are then separated and the amide is hydrolysed to obtain<br>
the desired enantiomer of HCT. Also this method presents many drawbacks,<br>
because the separation is performed in three steps and the cleavage of an<br>
amide is a difficult reaction. Moreover, it uses costly reagents and yields are<br>
low.<br>
There is therefore the need for an improved process for the resolution of<br>
HCT enantiomers.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has now been found that enantiomerically pure homocysteine-?-<br>
thiolactone can be prepared through optical resolution of racemic<br>
homocysteine-?-thiolactone<br><br>
with a chiral organic acid wherein one isomer is recovered as a<br>
diastereomeric salt with the organic acid and the other isomer remaining in the<br>
mother liquor is submitted to racemisation with a catalytic amount of an<br>
aromatic aldehyde and submitted again to optical resolution with the same<br>
chiral organic acid.<br>
In greater detail, the invention comprises two main embodiments: a first<br>
one (referred to as method 1 in the examples), wherein the diastereomeric salt<br>
remaining in the mother liquor is first isolated and then racemised with a<br>
catalytic amount of an aromatic aldehyde so as to provide racemic<br>
homocysteine-?-thiolactone which is submitted again to optical resolution and<br>
a second, more advantageous one (referred to as method 2 in the examples),<br>
wherein optical resolution is carried out in the presence of a catalytic amount<br>
of an aromatic aldehyde, so that one out of the two diastereomeric salts<br>
precipitates and the other one remaining in the mother liquor racemises. In the<br>
following, the expression "mother liquor" denotes the solution wherefrom the<br>
less soluble diastereoisomer precipitates.<br>
In greater detail, the first embodiment comprises the following steps:<br>
a) preparing a solution of racemic HCT in a suitable solvent;<br>
b) adding the solution with an enantiomerically pure chiral organic<br>
acid;<br>
c) optionally heating the solution and then cooling it until complete<br>
precipitation of the less soluble diastereomeric salt;<br>
d) separating the precipitated diastereomeric salt from the solution<br>
and liberating enantiomerically pure HCT<br><br>
e) adding the solution from step d) with HCl until complete<br>
precipitation of HCT hydrochloride enriched in the enantiomer which remained in<br>
solution;<br>
f) recovering the precipitate and treating it with a carboxylic acid,<br>
preferably acetic acid, in the presence of an aromatic aldehyde so as to precipitate<br>
racemic HCT hydrochloride salt;<br>
g) isolating racemic HCT hydrochloride salt;<br>
h) dissolving the salt in the same organic solvent as step a) and adding a<br>
base so as to liberate racemic HCT;<br>
i) repeating steps b)-d) and optionally e) - h) one or more times.<br>
The solvent used for the preparation of the solution of racemic HCT of<br>
step a) is a solvent or a mixture of solvents selected from water, alcohols, such<br>
as methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, or another suitable organic<br>
solvent, for example acetone or tetrahydrofuran. Enantiomerically pure chiral<br>
organic acids suitable for carrying out step b) are, for example,<br>
dibenzoyltartaric acid, ditoluoyltartaric acid, mandelic acid, tartaric acid,<br>
camphorsulfonic acid, ascorbic acid, malic acid, pyrogluthammic acid,<br>
aspartic acid, chinic acid, the most preferred being ditoluoyltartaric acid and<br>
mandelic acid. When heating of the solution is necessary in order to<br>
precipitate the less soluble diastereomeric salt, the temperature varies<br>
according to the solvent and can be increased up to the reflux temperature.<br>
Enantiomerically pure HCT recovered from step d) is preferably converted<br>
into the hydrochloride salt by dissolution in acetone and addition of hydrogen<br>
chloride, until complete precipitation of HCT hydrochloride.<br>
The starting solution of HCT can be prepared by dissolving<br>
commercially available racemic HCT hydrochloride in one or more of the<br>
above-mentioned solvents and adding an organic or inorganic base, such as<br>
triethylamine or hydroxides of alkaline metals. The same base is also used for<br>
step h).<br>
As indicated above, preferred resolving agents are ditoluoyltartaric acid<br>
and mandelic acid, since they allow to obtain yields ranging from 70 to 80<br>
percent based on the theoretical amount of the desired enantiomer.<br>
When using ditoluoyltartaric acid, the process is carried out by<br>
dissolving HCT hydrochloride in methanol and adding ditoluoyltartaric acid at<br>
room temperature. The resulting solution is added with a stoichiometric<br>
amount of triethylamine, so that triethylamine hydrochloride and the most<br>
soluble diastereomeric salt remain in the solution, while the less soluble<br>
diastereomeric salt precipitates. The precipitate is collected by filtration and<br>
further purified by treatment in acetone at room temperature. After filtration,<br>
HCT dibenzoyltartrate is suspended again in acetone and hydrochloric acid is<br>
added until complete precipitation of enantiomerically pure HCT<br>
hydrochloride.<br>
When using instead mandelic acid as the resolving agent, HCT<br>
hydrochloride is suspended in acetone and a stoichiometric amount of<br>
triethylamine is added. Triethylamine hydrochloride is filtered off and<br>
mandelic acid is added to the filtrate (which contains HCT as free base), until<br>
complete precipitation of the less soluble diastereomeric salt. The precipitate<br>
is collected by filtration, then suspended again in acetone and acidified with<br>
hydrochloric acid until precipitation of enantiomerically pure HCT<br>
hydrochloride.<br>
The aromatic aldehyde used in step f) is preferably selected from<br>
salicylaldehyde, m-hydroxy-benzaldehyde, p-hydroxy-benzaldehyde,<br>
o-anisaldehyde, m- anisaldehyde, p- anisaldehyde, salicylaldehyde being<br>
preferred; heating is required in order to accomplish racemisation. After 1-12<br>
hours, depending on the temperature, the solution is cooled until complete<br>
precipitation of racemic HCT hydrochloride, which is collected by filtration<br>
and washed with acetone, then submitted again to the resolution process.<br>
This first embodiment can be represented as in the following Scheme 1:<br><br>
in which B denotes a base and *AH denotes a chiral acid (resolving<br>
agent).<br>
The second embodiment of the invention comprises the following steps:<br>
a) preparing a solution of racemic HCT in a suitable solvent;<br>
b) adding the solution with an enantiomerically pure chiral organic<br>
acid and a catalytic amount of an aromatic aldehyde;<br>
c) heating the solution and then cooling it until precipitation of the<br>
less soluble diastereomeric salt of HCT with the chiral organic acid is<br>
complete;<br>
d) separating the precipitated diastereomeric salt from the solution<br>
and liberating enantiomerically pure 2-amino-4-mercaptobenzobutyric acid<br><br>
e) optionally adding HC1 to the solution from step d) and recovering<br>
racemic HCT hydrochloride to be submitted to a further resolution cycle.<br>
The starting solution can be prepared in the same way and with the<br>
same solvents as the first embodiment and steps c) - d) are also carried out as<br>
described above.<br>
This second embodiment has the remarkable advantage that the most<br>
soluble diastereomeric salt continuously racemise in the solution, while the<br>
less soluble one precipitates subtracting from the racemisation reaction, which<br>
is an equilibrium. Thus, at any point of the process only the racemate is<br>
present in the solution. The process continues until an equilibrium is reached<br>
between the solubility of the precipitated salt (regulated by its Ksp) and the<br>
kinetics of the racemisation reaction (regulated by its kinetic constant).<br>
Enantiomerically pure HCT is preferably isolated in the form of the<br>
hydrochloride salt by suspension in acetone and treatment with HC1.<br>
This embodiment allows to obtain yields of enantiomerically pure HCT<br>
hydrochloride higher than the theoretical amount, usually not lower than<br>
140%, calculated on the amount of the desired enantiomer in the racemate.<br>
This is possible because the undesired enantiomer is converted in situ into the<br>
desired one.<br>
After acidification and filtration, racemic HCT hydrochloride can be<br>
recovered from the mother liquor and can be submitted to a further resolution<br>
cycle, thus increasing yields further.<br>
This second preferred embodiment can be represented as in the<br>
following scheme 2, wherein the aromatic aldehyde is salicylaldehyde:<br><br>
The invention will be now illustrated in greater detail by means of the<br>
following examples.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1 - Resolution (method 1)<br>
R,S-HCT hydrochloride (154 g) and acetone (2500 mL) are charged<br>
into a reactor, added with triethylamine (139 mL) and stirred for an hour.<br>
Triethylamine hydrochloride is filtered off and the light yellow filtrate is<br>
charged again into the reactor with L-(+)-mandelic acid (114 g). A solid soon<br>
begins to precipitate; the suspension is cooled to 10°C for one hour and then<br>
filtered. S-HCT mandelate (118 g dry weight) is obtained, while the mother<br>
liquors are saved for the racemisation process.<br>
S-HCT mandelate is charged into the reactor with acetone (1500 mL)<br>
and hydrochloric acid 37% (44 mL) is added to the stirred suspension. Stirring<br>
is maintained for one hour at 15°C and the solid is filtered and washed with<br>
acetone. S-HCT hydrochloride is obtained (60.5 g dry weight, 78.5% yield),<br>
with an [a]D =+21.9°.<br>
Example 2 - Resolution (method 1)<br>
R,S-HCT hydrochloride (154 g), methanol (3000 mL) and (-)-ditoluoyl-L-<br>
tartaric acid (145 g) are charged into a reactor and the mixture is stirred until<br>
complete dissolution, then triethylamine (139 mL) is added dropwise at 20°C.<br>
Stirring is maintained at the same temperature for one hour, then the precipitated<br>
solid is filtered and washed with methanol; the mother liquors are saved for the<br>
racemisation process. The precipitate is instead charged again into the reactor<br>
with acetone (1500 mL) and stirred for one hour at room temperature, then<br>
filtered, obtaining L-HCT ditoluoyltartrate (120 g dry weight).<br>
S-HCT ditoluoyltartrate is suspended again in acetone (1500 mL) and<br>
37% hydrochloric acid (40 mL) is added to the stirred suspension. Stirring is<br>
maintained for one hour at 15°C and the resulting product is filtered and<br>
washed with acetone, obtaining 55.5 g of L-HCT hydrochloride (dry weight,<br>
72% yield), with an [a]D = +22.1°.<br>
Example 3 - Racemisation (method 1)<br>
The mother liquors from Example 1 are acidified to pH 1 with 37%<br>
hydrochloric acid and then concentrated to dryness under vacuum. The residue<br>
is dissolved in acetic acid (150 mL), added with salicylaldehyde (2 mL) and<br>
the solution is heated to 50°C for 5 hours, then cooled to 5°C for 2 hours. The<br>
resulting solid is filtered and washed thoroughly with acetone, obtaining<br>
racemic R,S-HCT hydrochloride (65.5 g dry weight).<br>
Example 4 - Resolution (method 2)<br>
R,S-HCT hydrochloride (250 g) is suspended in acetone (1250 mL) into<br>
a reactor and added with triethylamine (226.5 mL) under stirring. Stirring is<br>
continued for at least one hour, then triethylamine hydrochloride is filtered off<br>
and the light yellow filtrate is charged again into the reactor with<br>
L-(+)-mandelic acid (250 g) and salicylaldehyde (25 g). The solution turns<br>
persistent yellow, indicating imine formation, then a solid begins to<br>
precipitate. The suspension is stirred at room temperature for 5 hours, then the<br>
solid is collected by filtration and washed with acetone; the mother liquors are<br>
saved for the recovery of racemic HCT. The wet solid is suspended again in<br>
acetone (2500 mL) and added under stirring with 37% hydrochloric acid<br>
(109 mL). Stirring is maintained for one hour at 5°C and the solid is filtered<br>
and washed with acetone, obtaining 175 g of S-HCT hydrochloride (dry<br>
weight, 140% yield based on the desired enantiomer), with an [a]D = +22.5°.<br>
Example 5 - Recovery of starting material (Method 2)<br>
The mother liquors from Example 4 are acidified to pH 1 with<br>
hydrochloric acid and cooled to 5°C for 4 hours. The solid is collected by<br>
filtration and dried under vacuum, yielding 25 g of racemic R,S-HCT<br>
hydrochloride.<br>
