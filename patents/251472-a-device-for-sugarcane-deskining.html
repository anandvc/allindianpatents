				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a device for sugarcane deskinning.<br>
India is world's leader in sugar production but uses age-old traditional technology. Our country holds first position in the production of sugarcanes followed by Brazil. Frequent occurrence of drastic fluctuations in sugar production is a cause of concern for its effective utilization. Mini sugar plants (Khandsari units) have received little attention for technology upgradation. They can function as efficient supplementary production facilities with the application of modern methods of sugarcane processing. But, the major problem is the fermented smell that develops during storage, which is mainly due to waxes present on the skin.<br>
With the ever increasing demand for soft beverages and fruit based beverages, both carbonated and still, are available in the market. India offers itself a potential market for these products. All the sugarcanes produced in the country are not lifted by the sugar mills, leaving almost one third for use in the production of gur and khandsari. This necessitates finding ways and means of using sugarcane for other purposes. In this context, Central Food Technological Research Institute has made significant contributions in the field of sugarcane juice by undertaking front-line R&amp;D work. CFTRI has developed processes for the preservation of sugarcane juice beverage in bottle, standi pouches, aluminium cans and also as powders. The beverage, being natural possesses a lot of medicinal and curative properties in the treatment of several ailments. The beverage is calorific and nutritive.<br>
The critical step of the process is removal of the skin, which will eliminate jaggery flavour during storage and avoid settling of particles. Moreover the non-sugar impurities like gums, waxes, pectins, etc. are found mainly on the external surface of the cane crushed for juice extraction. Consequently, juice quality is poor and its clarification is a complex and costlier process, as expensive centrifuges have to be used, which add to the processing cost.<br>
By deskinning, external impurities are eliminated along with the rind. Consequently, juice quality is far superior. Also the extraction efficiency is at par with the multitendum mills, hence competitive and cost effective. These facts<br><br>
indicate the importance of deskinning the canes.<br>
Present status of Technology<br>
The canes are being deskinned manually by employing number of labourers using a heavy SS knife. However, this method of deskinning is highly labour intensive and tedious. Hence, a device for deskinning of sugarcane has been developed.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a device for sugarcane deskinning.<br>
Another object is to of the present invention is to reduce manual drudgery.<br>
Yet another object is to increase productivity.<br>
Still another object is to provide a device capable of working with a wide range of sizes of canes.<br>
In the drawing accompanying this specification, figure land figure 2 represents two different embodiments of the device for sugarcane deskinning.<br>
Accordingly a device for sugarcane deskinning, which comprises:<br>
a cylindrical bush (1) of 60 -100 mm diameter and 40 mm width to guide sugarcanes of desired length, provided with multiples of scrapper strips (2) 80 - 120 mm length and a trapezoidal shape with 9-12 mm width at one end and 5 mm width at the other end, the said scrapper strips provided with a depression of 5 mm radius made out of 12- 20 gauge stainless steel sheet, the said scrapper strips being connected with bolts on the periphery of the said bush (1) with tapped holes and a circular spring (3) mounted on the said depression of scrapper to hold the multiples of scrapper strips (2) securely and allow the opening of the scrapper strips, when higher diameter canes are inserted with a specific<br><br>
profile enclosed by 40 - 45° angle, 100- 110 mm and 25- 30 mm radius, made out of 12- 20 gauge stainless steel sheet connected with bolts on the face of the bush (1).<br>
In an embodiment the diameter of the dice is varied depending on the size of the canes by using the circular spring.<br>
The novelties of the present invention are:<br>
1.	The device can be used to deskin the canes in one stroke<br>
2.	The device can accommodate wide range of diameters from 25 mm to 35 mm, the normal variations of sugarcanes<br>
3.	The deskinning efficiency is 95% for small diameter canes and upto 80 % for bigger size canes<br>
4.	If higher efficiency is required, the canes have to be passed twice by rotating the canes by an angle of 30° form the first pass or two devices in tandem can be used.<br>
5.	By using a water jet through a pipe, the trimmings can be removed from the surface of the deskinning<br>
6.	This also facilitates the cleaning of the device automatically<br>
7.	The microbial load at the rinds is also considerably reduced due to deskinning and water cleaning<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention. The working of the deskinning device is explained below with particular reference to sugarcane deskinning.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
The device of design 1 was fixed onto a vice and sugarcane of 32mm diameter was fed through feeding port manually. The deskinning was observed visually for the removal of green colour. The deskinning efficiency was upto 90 %.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
The device of design 1 was fixed onto a vice and sugarcane of 32mm diameter was fed through feeding port manually. The deskinning was observed visually for the removal of green colour. The deskinning efficiency was upto 90 %.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
The device of design 2 was fixed onto a vice and sugarcane of 32mm diameter was fed through feeding port manually. The deskinning was observed visually for the removal of green colour. The deskinning efficiency was upto 85 %.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
The device of design 2 was fixed onto a vice and sugarcane of 25 mm diameter was fed through feeding port manually. The deskinning was observed visually for the removal of green colour. The deskinning efficiency was upto 90 %.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
We claim:<br>
1.	A device for sugarcane deskinning, which comprises:<br>
a cylindrical bush (1) of 60 -100 mm diameter and 40 mm width to guide sugarcanes of desired length, provided with multiples of scrapper strips (2) 80 - 120 mm length and a trapezoidal shape with 9-12 mm width at one end and 5 mm width at the other end, the said scrapper strips provided with a depression of 5 mm radius made out of 12- 20 gauge stainless steel sheet, the said scrapper strips being connected with bolts on the periphery of the said bush (1) with tapped holes and a circular spring (3) mounted on the said depression of scrapper to hold the multiples of scrapper strips (2) securely and allow the opening of the scrapper strips, when higher diameter canes are inserted with a specific profile enclosed by 40 - 45° angle, 100- 110 mm and 25- 30 mm radius, made out of 12- 20 gauge stainless steel sheet connected with bolts on the face of the bush (1).<br>
2.	A device as claimed in 1 wherein the diameter of the dice is varied depending on the size of the canes by using the circular spring.</td>
