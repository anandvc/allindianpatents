				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR IMPLEMENTING A LAYER 3/LAYER 7 FIREWALL IN AN L2 DEVICE<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
The present invention relates generally to data routing systems, and more particularly to methods and apparatus for providing secure communications on a network.<br>
A packet switch communication system includes a network of one or more switches or routers connecting a plurality of users. A packet is the fundamental unit of transfer in the packet switch communication system. A user can be an individual user terminal or another network.<br>
A layer 2 (L2"\ switch is a switching device-which receives packets containing data or control information on one port, and based on a media access connection (MAC) address contained within the packet, switches the packet out another port. Conventional L2 switches perform this switching function by evaluating layer 2 (L2) header information contained within the packet in order to determine the proper output port for a particular packet. The L2 switch includes a table that maps MAC addresses with output ports, if a MAC address is unknown (i.e., there is no corresponding entry in the table), then the corresponding packet is broadcast to all output ports wi.th the hope that another component in the packet switched communication system will recognize the MAC address (and pass back information to the forwarding L2 switch to update its table). Other types of L2 devices include bridges.<br>
A router is a switching device which receives packets containing data or control information on one port, and based on destination information contained within the packet, routes the packet to a next hop to/toward the destination. Conventional routers perform this switching function by evaluating layer 3 (L3) header information contained within the packet in order to determine a next hop for a particular packet. The layer 3 information includes an IP address associated with the intended destination (as well as source address) for the packet.<br>
The network coupling the users can be an intranet, that is, a network connecting one or more private servers such as a local area network (LAN). Alternatively, the network can be a public network, such as the Internet, in which data packets are passed over untrusted communication links. The network configuration can include a combination of public and private networks. For example, two or more LAN's with individual terminals can be coupled together using a public network such as the Internet. Data security issues can arise when public and private networks are linked or when distinct networks are coupled. For example, conventional packet switched communication systems that include links between public and private networks typically include security measures for assuring network access control and data integrity.<br>
In order to assure individual packet security, packet switched communication systems can include encryption/decryption services. Prior to leaving a trusted network (or portion of a network), individual packets can be encrypted to minimize the possibility of data loss while the packet is transferred over an untrusted (e.g., public) network (or portion thereof). Upon receipt at a destination or another trusted portion of the communication system (e.g., at a firewall just before the destination), the packet can be decrypted and subsequently delivered to its intended destination. The use of encryption and decryption allows for the creation of a virtual private network (VPN) between users separated by untrusted communication links.<br>
In addition to security concerns for the data transferred over the public portion of the communications system, the private portions of the network must safeguard against intrusions through the gateway provided at the interface of the private and the public networks. A firewall is a device that can be coupled in-line between a public network and private network for screening packets received from the public network. A firewall is a particular type of L3/L4 device that can be used to enforce policy and filtering functions. A firewall can include one or more engines for inspecting, filtering, authenticating, encrypting, decrypting and otherwise manipulating received packets. Conventional firewalls use L3 and L4 header information including IP addresses associated with the source and destination of a given packet being processed. Received packets are inspected and thereafter forwarded or dropped in accordance with the policies associated with the given domain.<br>
SUMMARY<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Referring now to FIG. 1, a packet switch communication network 100 includes a plurality of terminal units 102 configured in a plurality of zones 104 and coupled by one or more switchesl06.<br>
In one implementation, each terminal unit 102 is of the form of a standalone computer (e.g., a personal computer, a laptop or workstation). Alternatively, one or more terminal units may be of the form of a personal digital assistant (PDA), Web pad, two-way pager, cellular handset, or other termination or remote device in a communication or computing environment. In one implementation, each terminal is a gateway to another network or group of terminal units (e.g., to a LAN or a pool of servers).<br>
Each zone 104 embodies a security domain in the communication system. Each security domain can include separate policy, traffic management, accounting and administrative definitions and functions. Security policies, traffic management and other filtering functions can be enforced among and within zones. In one implementation, security policies are enforced between zones, while intra-zone communications are not subject to the security constraints. In one implementation, zones overlap. When zones overlap, policies associated with a parent zone can be a superset of the policies associated with one or more sub-zones (each including a subset of the overall policies). Alternatively, the policies associated with the parent zone may be separate and distinct from the policies of each sub-zone. For example, in one implementation, a zone can include one or more sub-zones, each including a separate set of policies.<br>
.In one implementation, each zone is associated with physical boundaries or other segmentation in the communication network. Alternatively, the assignment of particular terminal units to zones may represent groupings or combinations in a business structure (e.g., zones used to separate different functional entities in a business organization). Alternatively, the zones have no particular relation to physical boundaries. Communication between terminal units in each zone and among terminal units within a zone are controlled in accordance with protocols described below in association with switch 106.<br>
Switch 106 may be of different types. In one implementation, each switch 106 is configured as a layer 2 (L2) device and includes a plurality of ports on which packets from the communication network are received and transferred in accordance with L2 protocols. Each switch 106 includes a media access connection (MAC) table for use in determining switching of received packets. The MAC table associates MAC addresses with ports of the switch 106. Packets are processed as they arrive at the ports of each switch 106 in accordance with L2 header information contained within a given packet. Depending on the MAC address, packets are switched to an appropriate output port as specified in the MAC table.<br>
One or more of switches 106 are configured to enforce security domain constraints. For example, one or more of switches 106 is configured as an L2 firewall enabled security switch (hereinafter "security switch"). Referring now to FIG. 2, a security switch 200 includes a plurality of ports 202, a switch fabric 220 and an L2 controller 230. Each port 202 is coupled to a security controller 204 by a bus 206. The security controller 204 is coupled to one or more storage elements 208. In one implementation (not shown), each port 202 is associated with a separate security controller 204 and storage element 208. Alternatively, the security controller functionality can be combined in a single (as shown) or lesser number of individual security controller units. In addition, packets associated with all ports 202 can be stored in a single memory element 208 (as shown). Security switch 200 also includes a firewall device 210 that is coupled to (each) storage element 208 by a security bus 211.<br>
L2 controller 230 supports L2 switching protocols. Packets are either directly processed (e.g., intra-zone packets) or processed after a security screening (e.g., for inter-zone packets) as discussed in greater detail below. Associated with-L2 controller 230 is a MAC table 235. MAC table 235 includes plural entries each of which includes a MAC address and an indicator of a port 202 associated therewith. Switch fabric 220 is used to route traffic from storage element 208 to a respective port 202 under the control of L2 controller 230'using bus 221.<br>
Storage element 208 is partitioned into two portions. A first portion 215 is used to store packets received from a port 202 that are not subject to security screening. For example, in one implementation, packets received from a terminal unit in a same security zone (e.g., intra-zone traffic) are not subject to security screening. Un-screened packets are processed directly by L2 controller 230 and forwarded out a designated port in accordance with L2 protocols as specified in MAC table 235. Second portion 217 is used to store packets to be screened by firewall device 210.<br>
Security controller 204 includes a screening engine 240. Screening engine . 240 examines each packet received from a respective port 202 and determines whether security screening is to be performed. In one implementation, screening engine 240 examines the L2 header for each packet, and based on the screening, either forwards the packet to the first or second portion 215 and 217, respectively, of storage element 208. The L2 header includes a destination MAC address that can be mapped to an egress port on the device using the MAC table 235. Associated with each ingress and egress port is a security zone identifier. Security zone identifiers can be stored in a table of zone identifiers (not shown) that is indexed by port identifier (id). Screening engine 240 compares the security zone identifier associated with the packet being processed (determined from the identification of the egress port from the MAC table using the destination MAC address in the header of the packet being processed) with the security zone identifier associated with the port on which the packet was received in the device. Based on the comparison, screening engine 240 can determine whether the packet is destined for another zone (i.e., constitutes intra-zone or inter- zone communication).<br>
The screening of packets can be with or without the knowledge of the individual terminal units. Associated with security switch 200 is a user interface (not shown) and associated management tools (not shown) for constructing one or more security zones. In one implementation, the security zones are determined based on the destination MAC address included in the L2 header of the packet received. More specifically, each egress port can be assigned to a security zone and have an associated security zone identifier associated therewith. Alternatively, the security zones can be created for plural users coupled to different ports of the security switch 200. For example, security switch 200 can be configured to include three ports, where terminal units associated with a first two of the ports are assigned to a first zone, while terminal units associated with the third port are assigned to a second zone. Other configurations are possible. Zone assignments and partitions are discussed in greater detail below. The user interface allows an administrator or user to configure the security switch 200. The security switch 200 can be configured to create plural security zones and associate one or more interfaces with each zone. Thereafter, policies can be established for inspecting or otherwise screening packets as they traverse the security switch 200.<br>
Firewall device 208 includes plural engines for performing packet screening prior to routing packets through security switch 200. Firewall device 208 includes a firewall engine 270 and associated policies 271, authentication engine 272, encryption engine 274, decryption engine 276 and a firewall controller 278.<br>
Firewall controller 278 extracts packets from second portion 217 of storage element 208. Firewall controller 278 oversees the distribution of packets within the firewall device as well as the coordination among the respective engines. Each packet is evaluated and processed in accordance with policies based on one or more considerations. For example, packets can be screened based on source, destination or both. One or more policies 271 are retrieved and used by firewall engine 270 to inspect the packet. Packet inspection may also require encryption, decryption and authentication services. One or more of the encryption 272, decryption 274 and authentication 276 engines can be invoked by the firewall controller 278 as part of the inspection processes. Ln addition, other services can be provided including virtual private network termination services, session set-up and various other traffic management and security related functions. Examples of screening services are discussed in greater detail below. After the inspection, packets can be forwarded in the network or dropped as appropriate. In one implementation, packets that are to be forwarded (e.g., pass the inspection) are prepared as appropriate (e.g., encrypted) then forwarded to the first portion 215 of storage element 208. Alternatively, the packets may be returned to the second portion 217 of storage element 208 and marked as having been screened. In one implementation, screened packets are forwarded to a queue for processing by L2 controller 230. Screened packets are then processed by L2 controller 230 and switched to an appropriate output port in accordance with conventional L2 processing protocols.<br>
Each security switch 200 can be configured to create plural security zones. For example, a communications network having a security switch 200 is shown in FIG. 2b. The communications network is a VLAN structure that includes 3 zones. Security switch 200 includes a user interface and administrative control mechanisms for creating each of the security zones, specifying policies and other criteria for defining and managing each zone. The security zones enforced by the security switch 200 can be transparent to the end users. That is, the security zones can be established at the security switch 200 including the specification of all operating parameters associated with the security domain. Users in each zone may be unaware of the zone structure and may communicate with other users in a conventional manner. For example, a virtual private network can be created between users including encryption and decryption services without requiring the actual encryption and decryption support in the respective end users (e.g., encryption and decryption services can be provided in secure switches disposed between the two users). Accordingly, a system administrator can create a virtual private network between a remote user in one security zone and another user in a second security zone where the individual users are unaware of the VPN services and. are not required to include encryption or decryption services locally. In one implementation, the administrator provisioned VPN services are specified for remote users in a same zone.<br>
Alternatively, the users may be aware of the security structure and include indicators (e.g., zone identifiers) in packets transferred to other users. Each user may define their own custom L2 zone and an inter-zone policy for their network security requirements. For example, security switch 200 shown in FIG. 2b embodies a VLAN that in.cludes vl-trust, vl-untrust and vl-dmz zones. VI-trust defines a zone that includes two users including user 291 and user 292. Vl-untrust defines a zone that includes a single user 293. Vl-dmz defines a zone that includes three users, users 291, 292 and user 294. Separate policies can be enforced for communications between the three zones. For example, communications that are intra-zone between user 291 and user. 292 will not require inspection, and as such are handled by security switch 200 in accordance with conventional L2 protocols. Communications from user 291 to user 293 will invoke an inspection process as defined by the security system architect (e.g., user 291 or 292 or an administrator for such) for communications between VI - trust and Vl-untrust. Similarly, communications between user 294 and user 291 will invoke an inspection process (e.g., a potentially lesser screen) for communications between VI- dmz and VI-trust.<br>
Multiple interfaces are allowed inside each zone. For intra-zone traffic, security switch 200 behaves like a tradition L2 bridge forwarding a given packet based on the destination MAC-address. In one implementation, no firewall protection mechanisms are applied for the intra-zone traffic.<br>
For inter-zone traffic, standard firewall inspections (including policy inspection, TCP stateful inspection, etc. as described above) are performed for each<br>
incoming packet. In all cases, the egress interface is determined by the learned destination MAC address on the interface.<br>
Packet Flow<br>
Referring now to FIG. 3, a method 300 is shown, as invoked by the security switch 200, for processing packets. The method described is made with no particular reference to the specific hardware elements performing the steps. An exemplary hardware configuration is given above. The method can however be implemented in L2 switches having other configurations. The method begins with the receipt of a packet (302). The packet is evaluated to determine whether the packet is to be • inspected (304). If so, the packet is pre-processed as appropriate (305) and one or more policies are retrieved (306). The pre-processing of the packet can include decryption and authentication services. The retrieval of a policy includes the identification of the zone to which the packet is being transferred. Packets traveling between zones can be inspected using a security policy. Intra-zone communications may not be inspected. In one implementation, policies can be enforced on intra-zone communications. The retrieval of a policy includes a MAC look-up for the MAC destination address in a received packet in the MAC table to determine an egress port associated with the MAC address and necessarily a security zone. The security zones associated with the packet's ingress and egress ports are compared to determine if the packet is passing to another zone. Assuming that an inspection is to occur, an appropriate policy is retrieved (i.e., based on the ingress port and egress port identifiers and their respective security zones). Thereafter, the packet is inspected (308). Packet inspection can include screening and dropping the packet as required. If the packet is to be forwarded on the network (309), post-processing operations are invoked as appropriate (310). Alternatively, the packet is dropped (311). The post processing operations can include session set-up, encryption and other functions. Thereafter the packet is processed in accordance with conventional L2 protocols starting at step 312.<br>
At step 312, either a packet has passed inspection or did not require inspection. In either case, L2 header information is extracted to determine a MAC address associated with the packet. A look-up of the MAC address is performed<br>
(314) and the packet is then routed to an appropriate output port (316). Thereafter the process ends.<br>
Referring again to FIG. 2, the process steps are described with reference to one hardware implementation of the invention. Packets are received at a port 202. Each packet is transferred on bus 205 to, and routed through, security controller 204 and stored in storage element 208 via a storage bus 209. Security controller 204 evaluates each packet to determine if inspection is required and forwards the packets to an appropriate portion of storage device 208. Packets that are not to be inspected (i.e., packets stored in first portion 215 of storage device 208) are processed by L2 controller 230. When L2 controller 230 is available, packets are fetched and processed to determine a port to which the packet should be forwarded. L2 controller 230 evaluates the MAC address associated with the packet, and using MAC table 235, determines a port for routing. After processing by the L2 controller 230, the packet is forwarded to an appropriate link into switch fabric 220 for routing to a determined output port 202.<br>
Packets that are to be inspected are transferred by security controller 204 into second portion 217 of storage element 208. When firewall engine 210 is available, a packet is fetched and processed to determine a security policy to be used in inspecting the packet. Firewall engine 270 evaluates IP address(es) associated with the packet and implements traffic control and management functions as appropriate. Packets that are to be forwarded (i.e., pass inspection) are returned to storage element 208. Thereafter, the packet can be forwarded to an appropriate link into switch fabric 220 for routing to a determined output port 202. Other packets are dropped or otherwise handled in accordance with the policies defined for the given security zones.<br>
As discussed above, all packets that pass the inspection in the firewall device 210 as well as all packets that are not required to be inspected, are processed by L2 controller 230 in accordance with conventional L2 protocols. In one implementation, the processing of packets by L2 controller is modified to maintain security zones. More specifically, as discussed above, conventional L2 switches broadcast on all ports a packet that has a MAC address that is not recognized. This type of broadcast may well violate one or more security policies in place for given zones in the communication network. Accordingly, in one implementation a test packet is broadcast to each port. The broadcasting of test packets is described in more detail in association with FIG. 4.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 4, a method 400 is shown for handling packets by the L2 controller and includes receiving a packet to be processed (402). The MAC address for the packet is extracted (404). A check is made to locate an entry in a MAC address table that corresponds to the extracted MAC address (406). If a match is located (407), the packet is routed to an output port associated with the matching entry (408). If no match is located, the packet is dropped (410). In one implementation, the packet is merely held for a predetermined amount of time in hope of receiving information regarding the non-matching MAC address. If no match is located, a probe packet is created (412). The probe packet includes the MAC address associated with the_packet being processed (i.e., the original ingress packet). In one implementation, the probe packet is an "1CMP PING" packet with an IP TTL field set to 1. Each packet includes the same MAC addresses (L2) and source /destination IPs (L3) as the ingress packet whose MAC address could not be located. The probe packet is then broadcast to all ports (414). A check is made to determine if a response is received on any of the security device's ports (416). The ICMP PING packet will cause the right gateway, which was to receive and forward the original ingress packet, to respond to the L2 controller in the device with an "ICMP TTL expired" message packet. From the expired packet, the system can identify the proper egress port/zone associated with the received MAC address. This method guarantees that no information in the original ingress packet will be leaked out. If a response is received (indicating that a device coupled to the receiving port is configured to process packets having the identified MAC address), then the MAC table is updated to include an entry having the MAC address and a port identifier indicating the port on which the response was received (418). Thereafter the process ends.<br>
A number of embodiments of the invention have been described. Nevertheless, it will be understood that various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, the firewall device has been described in terms of screening at the L3 layer level. Alternatively, other screening can be invoked at other levels including layers up to and including layer 7 (L7)<br>
processing. Accordingly, other embodiments are within the scope of the following claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
