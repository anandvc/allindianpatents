				<td>INSECTICIDAL COMPOSITION AND<br>
METHOD FOR THE USE THEREOF<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to an insecticidal composition<br>
and to a method for the use thereof. In particular, the present invention<br>
is directed to an insecticidal composition which takes advantage of the<br>
synergistic action of two particular insecticides and to a method of<br>
using the composition to kill insects such as the tobacco budworm and<br>
other Lepidopteran pests of cotton.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The tobacco budworm and other Lepidopteran insects are<br>
serious pests of cotton fruit (squares and bolls). Moderate or heavy<br>
infestations can dramatically reduce lint yields.<br>
The tobacco budwom, Heliothis virescens. and cotton bollworm,<br>
Helicoverpa zea. have developed resistance to major classes of<br>
insecticides used to control them, as discussed in Martin et al., "Effects<br>
of Selected Synergists on Insecticide Toxicity in Tobacco Budworm<br>
(Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in Laboratory and Field Studies," J. Econ.<br>
Entomol. 90(3)723-731 (1997), Kanga et al., "Tolerance to<br>
Cypermethrin and Endosulfan in Field Populations of the Bollworm<br>
(Lepidoptera. Noctuidae) from Texas," J. Econ. Entomol. 89(3)583-589<br>
(1996), Kanga et al., "Monitoring for Resistance to Organophosphorus,<br>
Carbamate, and Cyclodiene Insecticides in Tobacco Budworm Adults<br><br>
(Lepidopteria: Noctuidae)," J. Econ. Entomol. 88(5)1144-1149 (1995),<br>
and Elzen et al., "Resistance to Pyrethroids, Carbamate, and<br>
Organophosphate Insecticides in Field Populations of Tobacco<br>
Budworms (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in 1990," J. Econ. Entomol.<br>
85(6):2064-2072(1992).<br>
New and better control alternatives are always needed to<br>
maintain crop production and provide alternative chemistry for rotation<br>
purposes, as discussed in Laws, Delta Agricultural Digest, Intertec<br>
Publishing (1998).<br>
While the compositions in the art have provided some control of<br>
Lepidopteran pests of cotton, there has been a need in the art for<br>
significantly greater control.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide significantly<br>
greater control of tobacco budworm, cotton bollworm, and other<br>
Lepidopteran pests of cotton than has been provided previously in the<br>
art.<br>
Accordingly, the present inventors conducted extensive<br>
experimentation and, as a result, they achieved the present invention,<br>
which provides a novel and highly effective, multi-chemistry alternative<br>
that provides synergistic results for the control of Lepidopteran insects<br>
on cotton and other crops on which they might be present.<br><br>
In particular, the present invention is directed to an insecticidal<br>
composition comprising (1) at least one compound of formula (I):<br><br>
wherein R1 is bromine, chlorine, methyl, or ethyl, R2 is bromine,<br>

S-, or -NH-, and n is 2, 3, or 4, and (2) at least one compound of<br>
formula (II):<br><br>
wherein R and R1 independently are an alkyl, alkenyl, or alkynyl group<br>
containing up to 6 carbon atoms, R2 is hydrogen, an alkyl group<br>
containing 1 to 18 carbon atoms, a cycloalkyl group containing 3 to 8<br>
carbon atoms, an alkenyl group containing 2 to 18 carbon atoms, or an<br>
alkynyl group containing 3 to 18 carbon atoms, R3 is hydrogen or an<br>
alkyl group containing 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and Y is -O- or -S-.<br>
Also, the present invention is directed to a method of killing<br>
Lepidopteran insects comprising applying to an area to be treated an<br>
insecticidally effective amourt of a composition comprising (1) at least<br>
one compound of formula (I):<br><br><br><br>
wherein R1 is bromine, chlorine, methyl, or ethyl, R2 is bromine,<br>
chlorine, or ethyl, R3 is hydrogen, halogen, or trifluoromethyl, X is -0-, -<br>

alkynyl group containing 3 to 18 carbon atoms, R3 is hydrogen or an<br>
alkyl group containing 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and Y is -O- or -S-.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
One component of the composition of the present invention is a<br>
compound of formula (1):<br><br>
where R1 is bromine, chlorine, methyl, or ethyl, R2 is bromine, chlorine,<br>
or ethyl, R3 is hydrogen, halogen, or trifluoromethyl, X is -O-, -S-, or -<br><br>
NH-, and n is 2, 3, or 4. This compound and methods for its<br>
preparation are described in detail in WO 96/11909, which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
A particularly preferred compound within formula (I) is one in<br>
which R1 is chlorine, R2 is chlorine, R3 is hydrogen, X is -O-, and n is 3,<br>
i.e., 2-[3-[2,6-dichloro-4-(3,3-oichloroprop-2-enyloxy)phenoxy]propoxy]-<br>
5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridine (which has been revised from 3,5-dichloro-4-<br>
(3-(5-trifluoromethyl-2-pyridyloxy)propyloxy)-1-(3,3-dichloro-2-<br>
propenyloxy)benzene).<br>
A compound of formula (I) can be prepared by the following<br>
method.<br><br>
wherein R1 is bromine, chlorine, methyl, or ethyl, R2 is bromme,<br>
chlorine, or ethyl, X is -O-, -S-. or -NH-, and n is 2, 3, or 4, is reacted<br>
with a compound of formula (b 1<br><br>
where R3 is hydrogen, halogen, or trifluoromethyl and L is halogen<br>
(e.g., chlorine, bromine, or iodine), mesyloxy, ortosyloxy.<br><br>
The reaction is preferably effected in an inert solvent in the<br>
presence of a suitable base.<br>
Examples of the solvent which can be used are ketones such as<br>
acetone, methyl ethyl ketone and cyclohexanone; ethers such as 1,2-<br>
dimethoxyethane, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane and dialkyl (e.g., C1-C4)<br>
ethers (e.g., diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether); N,N-dimethylformamide,<br>
dimethylsulfoxide, hexamethylphosphoric triamide, sulforane,<br>
acetonitrile, nitromethane; halogenated hydrocarbons such as<br>
dichloromethane, chloroform, 1,2-dichloroethane and chlorobenzene;<br>
hydrocarbons such as toluene, benzene and xylene; and water. If<br>
necessary, a mixture of these solvents can be used.<br>
Examples of the base which can be used are hydroxides of<br>
alkali metals or alkaline earth metals, such as lithium hydroxide,<br>
sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide;<br>
carbonates of alkali metals or alkaline earth metals, such as lithium<br>
carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate and calcium<br>
carbonate; hydrides of alkali metals or alkaline earth metals, such as<br>
lithium hydride, sodium hydride, potassium hydride and calcium<br>
hydride; alkali metal alkoxides (e.g., C1-C4) such as sodium methoxide,<br>
sodium ethoxide and potassium tert-butoxide; and organic bases such<br>
as triethylamine and pyridine. If necessary, catalysts such as<br>
ammonium salts (e.g., triethylbenzylammonium chloride) may be<br><br>
added to the reaction system at a ratio of 0.01 to 1 mole per mole of<br>
the compound of formula (a).<br>
The reaction temperature is usually set within the range of -20°C<br>
to 150°C or the boiling point of a solvent used in the reaction,<br>
preferably -5°C to 100°C or the boiling point of a solvent used in the<br>
reaction.<br>
The molar ratio of the starting materials and dehydrating agents<br>
to be used in the reaction can be freely determined, but it is favorable<br>
to effect the reaction at an equimolar ratio or a ratio closer thereto.<br>
After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture is<br>
subjected to ordinary post-treatments such as organic solvent<br>
extraction and concentration, and the desired compound of the present<br>
invention can be isolated. Further, purification can be carried out by an<br>
ordinary technique such as chromatography, distillation or<br>
recrystallation.<br>
Another component of the composition of the present invention<br>
is a compound of formula (l():<br><br>
wherein R and R1 independently are an alkyl, alkenyl, or alkynyl group<br>
containing up to 6 carbon atoms, R2 is hydrogen, an alkyl group<br><br>
containing 1 to 18 carbon atoms, a cycloalkyl group containing 3 to 8<br>
carbon atoms, an alkenyl group containing 2 to 18 carbon atoms, or an<br>
alkynyl group containing 3 to 18 carbon atoms, R3 is hydrogen or an<br>
alkyl group containing 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and Y is -0- or -S-. This<br>
compound and methods for its preparation are described in detail in<br>
U.S. Patents 3,176,600, 3,845,172, and 3,914,417, which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
A preferred compound within formula (II) is one in which R and<br>
R1 independently are a methyl, ethyl, ally) or alkenyl group, R2 is<br>
hydrogen or an alkyl group, R3 is hydrogen, and Y is -0-.<br>
A particularly preferred compound within formula (II) is one in<br>
which R, R1 and R2 are methyl groups, R3 is hydrogen, and Y is -0-.<br>
This compound is known as acephate and is commercially available,<br>
e.g., from the Chevron Chemical Company under the trade name<br>
Orthene®.<br>
The composition of the present invention comprises a mixture of<br>
at least one compound of formula (I) and at least one compound of<br>
formula (II). A particularly preferred composition of the present<br>
invention comprises a mixture of 2-[3-[2,6-dichloro-4-(3,3-dichloroprop-<br>
2-enyloxy)phenoxy]propoxy]-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridine (hereinafter<br>
referred to as "S-1812" for convenience) and acephate.<br>
In the composition of the present invention, the ratio of the<br>
compound of formula (I): the compound of formula (II) can vary<br><br>
preferably from 1:3.3 to 1:'27.8, more preferably from 1:3.3 to 1:64,<br>
even more preferably from 1:3.3 to 1:15, on a parts by weight basis.<br>
For example, the ratio of 3-1812:acephate can vary from 1 part S-<br>
1812:5 parts acephate to 1 part S-1812:127.8 parts acephate. As an<br>
example within this range, the ratio of S-1812:acephate can vary from<br>
1 part S-1812:16 parts acephate to 1 part S-1812:127.8 parts<br>
acephate. As another example within this range, the ratio of S-<br>
1812:acephate can vary from 1 part S-1812:5 parts acephate to 1 part<br>
S-1812:10 parts acephate.<br>
Other components which can be present in the invention<br>
composition include emulsifiers and solvents. For example, an<br>
emulsifiable concentrate formulation of S-1812 can be prepared using<br>
anionic-nonionic emulsifier blends such as Atlox 3454 and Atlox 3455,<br>
manufactured by Uniqema (formerly ICI Surfactants), and an aromatic<br>
hydrocarbon solvent such as Solvesso 150, manufactured by Exxon<br>
Chemical Company. When added to water, this formulation of S-1812<br>
forms a solution containing S-1812 which can then be added to an<br>
acephate-containing solution to form a solution of the composition of<br>
the present invention.<br>
Once formulated, the invention composition is useful in a<br>
method for controlling Lepidopteran insects by application of the<br>
composition onto the insecticidal habitat. In general, the invention<br><br>
composition can be applied onto the habitat in an amount effective to<br>
be insecticidal to the insects<br>
In the solution application of the present invention, the invention<br>
composition can be dissolved in from about 3 gallons to about 10<br>
gallons of water for application per acre, such that preferably at least<br>
about 0.063 lb and 0.5 lb of active ingredient (compounds of formula (I)<br>
and formula (II), respectively), more preferably from about 0.063 lb and<br>
0.5 lb to about 0.1 lb and 0 75 lb of active ingredient is applied per<br>
acre.<br>
The composition ot the present invention has been<br>
demonstrated in the laboratory and in the field to be highly effective<br>
against Lepidopteran insects, bollworm, beet armyworm, soybean<br>
looper, and tarnished plant bug, providing synergistic results as<br>
compared with the performance of the individual active ingredients. As<br>
a result, the present invention provides excellent control of<br>
Lepidopteran pests of cotton and other crops on which they might<br>
occur.<br>
The following examples illustrate specific embodiments of the<br>
present invention, but should not be construed as limiting the scope of<br>
the claims in any way. All parts, percents, ratios and the like are by<br>
weight unless otherwise indicated.<br><br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1<br>
An S-1812-containing lormulation identified as "S-1812 0.83EC<br>
was prepared by mixing the following components (w/v%):<br>
S-1812 (active ingredient)	10.3%<br>
Atlox 3454F (errulsifier)	2.0%<br>
Atlox 3455F (errulsifier)	8.0%<br>
Solvesso 150 (solvent)	79.7%<br>
Total	100.0%<br>
As set forth above, S-1812 0.83EC has 10.3% ai on a w/v%<br>
basis, i.e., 0.83 lb ai/gallon [(0.1 g ai/ml)(3785 ml/1gallon)(1 lb/454 g)].<br>
0.2g of S-1812 0.83EC was added to 800 ml distilled H20 and<br>
stirred to give a 25 ppmai (parts per million active ingredient) solution.<br>
This solution was serially diluted by 300 ml stock/300 ml distilled H20<br>
to yield solution concentrations of 12.5, 6.25 and 3.13 ppmai.<br>
0.02g of acephate (Orthene, technical grade, 98% pure) was<br>
added to 50 ml of S-1812 6.26 ppmai stock and 50 ml of S-1812 3.13<br>
ppmai stock to give 400 ppmai acephate + 6.25 ppmai S-1812, and<br>
400 ppmai acephate + 3.13 ppmai S-1812 mixtures.<br>
The above procedure was repeated with 0.01 g of acephate to<br>
yield 200 ppmai acephate + 6.25 or 3.13 ppmai S-1812 mixtures.<br><br>
The procedure set forth in the preceding paragraph was<br>
repeated with 100 ml of S-1812 3.13 or 6.25 ppmai stock to yield 100<br>
ppmai acephate + 6.25 or 3.13 ppmai S-1812 mixtures.<br>
Solutions of acephate alone of the various concentrations were<br>
prepared in a similar manner using distilled H2O.<br>
The testing substrate was composed of 2.0 ml of prepared<br>
artificial tobacco budworm diet mix (Bio-Serv) dispensed into the<br>
bottom of a clear one ounce cup. The diet was dispensed in such a<br>
way that the surface when dry was level and smooth (no pits).<br>
0.2 ml of the test mixture was pipetted onto the surface of the<br>
diet. The treated diet was placed under a fume hood to dry the test<br>
solution onto the diet surface (approximately one hour).<br>
After drying, one second instar tobacco budworm larvae was<br>
placed into each cup, and the cup was seated with a tight fitting, but<br>
not airtight, lid. The cups were held at 25°C and 50% RH and<br>
evaluated after seven days. Larvae were rated as dead or alive at this<br>
point. There were 20 replicates per treatment with one cup = one<br>
replication.<br>
The results of this testing are shown in Table 1 below.<br><br><br>
As can be seen from the results presented above in Table 1, the<br>
compounds of formulas (I) and (II) act synergistically together to<br>
increase the mortality rate beyond the sum of the rates for the<br>
compounds individually and thereby provide unexpectedly superior<br>
control of a Lepidopteran pest.<br>
Example 2<br>
Spray treatments were applied by a tractor mounted (highboy)<br>
spray boom to cotton fieid plots in Greenville, Mississippi that<br>
measured 40-50 ft by 13.2 ft by 13.2 ft with 3-4 replications per<br>
treatment. Treatments were applied at 10 gallons of spray volume per<br>
acre. Tank-mixes were made by measuring both compounds<br>
independently and then adding them to the appropriate amount of<br><br>
water to produce the spray mixture. Treatments were applied in<br>
July/August at approximately one week intervals.<br>
Plots were evaluated by sampling all damaged and undamaged<br>
bolls on 10 plants per plot. Cotton plots were evaluated for yield by<br>
machine picking the center two rows of each plot. The results are<br>
shown in Table 2 below.<br><br><br><br>

1.0EC has 1.0 lb ai/gallon<br>
90SP has 90% ai on a per weight basis<br>
.83EC has 0.83 lb ai/gallon<br>
CV = Coefficient of Variation (a statistic for comparison of like<br>
experiments)<br>
LSD = Fisher's Least Significant Difference (a statistical method of<br>
comparing two means for significant difference by providing the<br>
smallest valid difference)<br><br>
As can be seen from the data presented above in Table 2, a<br>
mixture of compounds of fonnulas (I) and (II) provides unexpectedly<br>
superior results with respect to reducing the percentage of damaged<br>
bolls, providing a higher number of bolls per plant, and providing a<br>
higher yield in pounds of seud cotton per acre as compared with the<br>
use of compounds of formulas (I) and (II) individually and as compared<br>
with the use of other insecticides.<br>
Example 3<br>
Additional testing was conducted against a variety of<br>
Lepidopteran pests as shown in Table 3 below.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Trt = treatment<br>
UTC = untreated cotton<br>
WP = wettable powder<br>
SP = soluble powder<br>
SC = soluble concentrate<br>
35 WP has 35% ai on a per weight basis<br>

A treatment is a particular insecticide or insecticide mixture being<br>
tested.<br>
The number of replicates or replications is the number of times a<br>
treatment is identically repeated within the same test (for example,<br>
tested on 3-4 plots in a field test).<br><br>
As can be seen from the results presented above in Table 3, the<br>
mixture of compounds as in the present invention again provided<br>
unexpectedly superior results as compared with the compounds<br>
individually and as compared with another insecticidal mixture.<br>
While the invention has been described in detail and with<br>
reference to specific embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to one<br>
skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made<br>
therein without departing from the spirit and scopethereof.<br><br>
