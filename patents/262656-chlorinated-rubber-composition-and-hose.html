CHLORINATED RUBBER COMPOSITION AND HOSE<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
This invention relates to a chlorinated rubber<br>
composition and a hose produced by using such chlorinated<br>
rubber composition.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]<br>
Chlorinated rubbers (for example, chlorinated<br>
polyethylene rubbers and chlorosulfonated polyethylenes) have<br>
excellent properties such as resistance to thermal aging, oil<br>
resistance, cold resistance, weatherability, flame resistance,<br>
and electric properties, and they are used as the molding<br>
materials of various high pressure hoses as such as automobile<br>
power stearing hoses; cable sheaths; gaskets; packings; and<br>
other molded articles.<br>
[0003]<br>
Of such molding materials, the high pressure hoses<br>
produced by using a chlorinated rubber for the rubber layer<br>
should have sufficient resistance to degradation by zinc<br>
because, when such hoses become in contact with a metal part,<br><br>
and in particular, with zinc-plated joint at a high pressure<br>
and a high temperature, the chlorinated rubber constituting<br>
the rubber layer is rapidly and harshly degraded or hardened<br>
with cracks formation in the rubber layer or embrittlement or<br>
tearing of the rubber layer.<br>
[0004]<br>
As a technnique to solve such problems, patent document<br>
1 discloses a composition for chlorinated polyethylene<br>
crosslinked rubber comprising (a) 100 parts by weight of<br>
chlorinated polyethylene, (b) 2 to 10 parts by weight of<br>
organic peroxide, (c) 3 to 20 parts by weight of crosslinking<br>
aid, and (d) 3 to 40 parts by weight of at least one acid<br>
acceptor selected from hydrotalcites and zeolites (claim 1}.<br>
[0005]<br>
Patent document 1: JP 2001-226546 A<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Problems to be solved by the Invention<br>
[0006]<br>
However, the hose produced by using the composition for<br>
a chlorinated polyethylene crosslinked rubber of JP 2001-<br>
226546 A for the rubber layer was found to be insufficient in<br>
the resistance to degradation by zinc despite its sufficient<br><br>
physical properties such as resistance to thermal aging, oil<br>
resistance, and adhesion.<br>
In view of the situation as described above, an object<br>
of the present invention is to provide a chlorinated rubber<br>
composition which can be used in producing a hose exhibiting<br>
excellent resistance to degradation by zinc together with the<br>
sufficient physical properties such as resistance to thermal<br>
aging, oil resistance, and adhesion. Another object of the<br>
present invention is to provide a hose produced by using such<br>
chlorinated rubber composition for the rubber layer.<br>

detail.<br>
The chlorinated rubber composition of the present<br>
invention (hereinafter simply referred to as "the rubber<br>
composition of the present invention") comprises a chlorinated<br>
rubber, a metal deactivator, an acid acceptor, and an<br>

[0020]<br>
Preferable examples of such chlorinated rubbers include<br>
chlorinated polyethylene (CM) such as those prepared by<br>
chlorinating polyethylene, chlorosulfonated polyethylene (CSM)<br>
prepared by simultaneously chlorinating and chlorosulfonating<br>

blending with the chlorinated rubber may be used at an amount<br>
up to 30% by weight in relation to the total weight after the<br>
blending.<br>
[0023]<br>
The metal deactivator is a chelating agent having the<br>
function of chelating the metal ion to prevent the metal ion<br>
from acting as the catalyst. In the present invention, the<br>
zinc that has moved into the chlorinated rubber is chelated to<br>
thereby suppress the reaction between the hydrogen chloride<br>
generated by the dechlorination of the chlorinated rubber and<br>
the zinc, and to further prevent the dechlorination induced by<br>
the catalytic function of the zinc chloride (ZnCl2) produced<br>
by such reaction between the hydrogen chloride and the zinc.<br>

or K) salt of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and tris[2-t-<br>
butyl-4-thio(2' -methyl-4' -hydroxy-5' -t-butyl)phenyl-5-methyl]-<br>
phenyl phosphite, which may be used alone or in combination of<br>
two or more.<br>
[0025)<br>
Among these, the preferred is bisbenzylidenehydrazide<br>
oxalic acid in view of suppressing the reaction between the<br>
hydrogen chloride generated by the dechlorination of the<br>
chlorinated rubber and the zinc.<br>
[0026]<br>
Examples of the commercially available metal deactivator<br>
which may be used in the present invention include oxalic acid<br><br>
bisbenzylidene hydrazide (product name: Inhibitor OABH,<br>

and 2,2'-oxamide bis[ethyl-3-(3,5-t-butyl-4-<br>
hydroxyphenyl)propionate] (product, name: Naugard XL-1,<br>
manufactured by Shiraishi Calcium).<br>
[0027]<br>
In the present invention, the metal deactivator is<br>
incorporated at an amount of at least 0.3 parts by weight,<br>
preferably at 0.5 to 20 parts by weight, and more preferably 1<br>
to 10 parts by weight in relation to 100 parts by weight of<br>
the chlorinated rubber.<br>
[0028)<br><acid acceptor><br>
The acid acceptor is an additive (stabilizer) which<br>
stabilizes the polymer by reacting with the halogenated<br>
hydrogen (acid) generated by thermal decomposition or the like<br>
of the polymer. In the present invention, hydrogen chloride<br>
which is formed in the course of the dechlorination of the<br>
chlorinated rubber is trapped to thereby suppress formation of<br><br>
the zinc chloride (ZnCl2) which plays the role of catalyst in<br>
the dechlorination.<br>

compounds; which may be used alone or in combination of two or<br>
more.<br>
Among these, the preferred are Ca-Mg-Zn, Ba-Mg-Zn, Ca-<br>
Zn-Sn, and Ba-Zn based complex stabilizer; fatty acid metallic<br>
soaps; and hydrotalcites (and in particular, basic carbonate<br>
of Mg and/or Al) since they are free from heavy metals such as<br>
lead that cause environmental pollution, and they have<br>
excellent thermal stability.<br>
Typical fatty acid metallic soaps are alkali metal salts<br>
of fatty acid and the preferable examples include lithium salt,<br>
potassium salt, and sodium salt of a saturated fatty acid<br>
containing 1 to 18 carbon atoms, an unsaturated fatty acid<br>
containing 3 to 18 carbon atoms, an aliphatic dicarboxylic<br>
acid, and an aromatic carboxylic acid.<br>
[0030]<br>
In the present invention, the acid acceptor may<br>
preferably comprise a combination of hydrotalcite and a fatty<br><br>
acid metallic soap since they are synergetic in trapping the<br>
hydrogen chloride.<br>

included at a content of at least 1 parts by weight,<br>
preferably at 1 to 40 parts by weight, and more preferably at<br>
1 to 20 parts by weight in relation to 100 parts by weight of<br>
the chlorinated rubber.<br>
[0033]<br><antioxidant><br><br>
The antioxidant is blended for the purpose of<br>
suppressing the oxidation chain reaction of the rubber, and in<br>
the present invention, the antioxidant is used for the purpose<br>
of suppressing generation of radicals in the initial stage of<br>
the chlorinated rubber degradation (for example, the polymer<br>
radical, polymer hydroperoxide radical, and the like as<br>
described below), trapping the polymer radical, and<br>
suppressing the binding (curing) of the polymer radical.<br>

name: Adeka Stab 1178, manufactured by ADEKA), and dilauryl<br>
3,3'-thiodipropionate (product name: Antiox L, manufactured by<br>
NOF Corporation).<br>
[0040]<br>
In the present invention, the antioxidant may be<br>
included at a content of 0.1 to 10 parts by weight, preferably<br>
at 0.5 to 5 parts by weight, and more preferably at 0.5 to 3<br>
parts by weight in relation to 100 parts by weight of the<br>
chlorinated rubber.<br>
[0041]<br>
The rubber composition of the present invention contains<br>
a predetermined amount of each of the chlorinated rubber, the<br><br>
metal deactivator, the acid acceptor, and the antioxidant in<br>
relation to the chlorinated rubber, and this enables<br>
production of a hose having excellent resistance to<br>
degradation by zinc together with sufficient physical<br>
properties such as resistance to thermal aging, oil resistance,<br>
and adhesion.<br>
The inventors of the present invention estimate that the<br>
resistance to degradation by zinc is realized by the following<br>
reasons.<br>
[0042]<br>
Presumably, the main reason for the degradation of the<br>
chlorinated rubber by zinc is hardening and embrittlement of<br>
the polymer by zinc chloride (ZnCl2) which is formed by the<br>
reaction between the chlorine and the zinc. More specifically,<br>
the degradation of the chlorinated rubber by zinc is<br>
postulated to involve the following elementary reactions (1)<br>
to (4).<br>
[0043]<br>
(1) Dechlorination<br>
The chlorinated polymer under the influence of heat is<br>
postulated to undergo the dechlorination represented by the<br>
following reaction scheme:<br><br><br>
wherein RC1 is the chlorinated part of the chlorinated rubber,<br>
RH is the polyolefin part of the chlorinated rubber, R-<br>
represents polymer radical, and CI- represents chlorine<br>
radical.<br>
[0044]<br>
(2)	Formation of zinc chloride<br>
Presumably, the hydrogen chloride formed by the<br>
dechlorination formes zinc chloride (ZnCl2) by reacting with<br>
zinc or zinc oxide by the reaction scheme:<br>
2HC1 + Zn → ZnCl2 + H2<br>
2HC1 + ZnO → ZnCl2 + H2O<br>
[0045]<br>
(3)	Chain reaction of dechlorination and radical formation in<br>
the presence of zinc chloride (ZnCl2)<br><br>
The thus formed ZnCl2 is a Louis acid catalyst which<br>
functions as a catalyst in the dechlorination of the<br>
halogenated alkyl, and therefore, it should promote<br>
dechlorination of the chlorinated rubber and formation of<br>
polymer radical.<br>
[Chemical formula 1]<br><br>
wherein ROO- is polymer hydroperoxide radical, and ROOH is<br>
polymer hydroperoxide.<br>
[0046]<br>
(4) Hardening<br>
Mutual binding (hardening) or crosslinking of the thus<br>
formed polymer radical results in the increase in the<br>
crosslinking density, and the polymer becomes even more<br>
brittle. The embrittled chlorinated rubber is subject to<br>
crack formation and breakage by the externally applied stress,<br>
thereby experiencing the degradation by zinc.<br>
R- + R∙ → R-R<br>
ROO- + R∙ → ROOR<br>
[0047]<br>
Based on such estimation of the mechanism of the<br>
degradation by zinc of the chlorinated polymer, the inventors<br>
of the present invention arrived at the following integral<br>
countermeasure for such zinc degradation of the chlorinated<br>
polymer.<br>
(A)	Trapping of chlorine (countermeasure for dechlorination<br>
and ZnCl2 formation)<br>
Formation of the ZnCl2 which is the catalyst for the<br>
dechlorination can be suppressed if the chlorine that had left<br>
the chlorinated rubber could be trapped without delay.<br>
(B)	Trapping of zinc (countermeasure for ZnCl2 formation)<br><br>
Formation of the ZnCl2, and hence, dechlorination can be<br>
suppressed if zinc in the chlorinated rubber could be<br>
stabilized by chelation.<br>
(C) Trapping of radical (countermeasure for hardening)<br>
Mutual binding (hardening) of the polymer radical, and<br>
hence, the embrittlement of the chlorinated rubber can be<br>
suppressed if the polymer radical that had been formed could<br>
be eliminated.<br>
[0048]<br>
Incorporation of the metal deactivator as described<br>
above at a predetermined amount should prevent dechlorination<br>
of the chlorinated rubber by chelation of the zinc that has<br>
moved into the chlorinated rubber; suppress the reaction<br>
between the hydrogen chloride generated by the dechlorination<br>
of the chlorinated rubber and the zinc; and prevent the<br>
dechlorination of the chlorinated rubber promoted by the zinc<br>
chloride (ZnCl2) generated in such dechlorination acting as a<br>
catalyst (see (B), above).<br>
Incorporation of the acid acceptor at a predetermined<br>
amount is believed to enable trapping of the hydrogen chloride<br>
generated in the course of the dechlorination of the<br>
chlorinated rubber to thereby suppress the promotion of the<br>
decomposition of the chlorinated rubber and the generation of<br><br>
the zinc chloride (ZnCl2) by the escaped hydrogen chloride<br>
(see (A), above).<br>
Furthermore, incorporation of the antioxidant at a<br>
predetermined amount is believed to suppress generation of the<br>
radicals generated in the initial stage of the chlorinated<br>
rubber deterioration, and facilitate trapping of the polymer<br>
radical as well as suppression of the mutual binding of the<br>
polymer radical (hardening) (see (C), above).<br>
[0049]<br>
In the present invention, resistance to degradation by<br>
zinc was evaluated as described below and in the Examples.<br>
First, the vulcanized sheet comprising the rubber<br>
composition of the present invention having a thickness of 2<br>
mm was brought in contact with a zinc sheet, and after<br>
compressing the laminate by 20%, the sheet was left in an oven<br>
at 150°C for 72 hours.<br>
The laminate was allowed to cool to room temperature,<br>
and the vulcanized sheet was separated from the zinc sheet.<br>
The vulcanized sheet was bent at an angle of 180°C by using a<br>
clip, and the surface on the side that had been in contact<br>
with the zinc sheet was checked for the generation of cracks<br>
by using a microscope (at a magnification of 100),<br>
The resistance to degradation by zinc was evaluated to<br>
be acceptable when no cracks were found on the surface.<br><br>
[0050]<br>
If desired, the rubber composition of the present<br>
invention may optionally contain additives such as a filler,<br>
reinforcing agent, antiaging agent, vulcanizer, vulcanization<br>
accelerator, vulcanization aid, plasticizer, pigment (dye),<br>
tackifier, lubricant, dispersant, and processing aid at an<br>
amount that does not adversely affect the object of the<br>
present invention.<br>
[0051]<br>
The method used for producing the rubber composition of<br>
the present invention is not particularly limited, and in an<br>
exemplary method, the chlorinated rubber, the metal<br>
deactivator, the acid acceptor, and the antioxidant are mixed<br>
(kneaded) by an open roll, kneader, extruder, universal<br>
agitator, batch kneader, or the like.<br>
The temperature used for the mixing of the components is<br>
not particularly limited since the temperature is determined<br>
by the apparatus used for the mixing. When a batch kneader is<br>
used for the mixing, the mixing is preferably conducted at a<br>
temperature of 50 to 160°C, and more preferably at 50 to 120°C.<br>
Also, the time used for the mixing is not particularly<br>
limited since the temperature is determined by the apparatus<br>
used for the mixing. In the case of a batch kneader, the<br>
mixing is preferably accomplished in about 1 to 15 minutes.<br><br>
[0052]<br>
The hose of the present invention is a hose comprising<br>
the rubber layer(s) formed by using the rubber composition of<br>
the present invention and a reinforcement layer adjacent to<br>
the rubber layer(s).<br>
[0053]<br>
A preferred embodiment of the hose of the present<br>
invention is shown in FIG. 1. FIG. 1 is a perspective view in<br>
which the layers of the hose are partially cut away.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, hose 1 comprises a rubber inner<br>
layer 2 as an inner tube overlaid with a reinforcement layer 3<br>
and a rubber outer layer 4 as an outer tube.<br>
[0054]<br>
Next, the rubber layers (the rubber inner layer and the<br>
rubber outer layer) and the reinforcement layer constituting<br>
the hose of the present invention are described in detail.<br>
[0055]<br><rubber layer><br>
The rubber layers are the layers adjacent to the<br>
reinforcement layer, and the hose of the present invention has<br>
the rubber inner layer and the rubber outer layer.<br>
In the present invention, the rubber inner layer or the<br>
rubber outer layer in contact with metal parts are formed by<br>
using the rubber composition of the present invention in order<br><br>
to improve resistance to degradation by zinc when such rubber<br>
layer became in contact with a zinc-plated joint and other<br>
metal parts. Even if the zinc plating is covered by another<br>
plating layer of chromium or the like, the rubber composition<br>
of the present invention may be used if the exposed zinc may<br>
become in contact with the chlorinated rubber.<br>
By forming the rubber layers using the rubber<br>
composition of the present invention, a hose having an<br>
improved resistance to degradation by zinc can be produced<br>
even if the reinforcement layer was formed by using a fiber<br>
material or a metal material such as a steel wire for the<br>
reinforcement layer.<br>
[0056]<br>
In the present invention, the rubber inner layer may<br>
have a thickness of 0.2 to 4.0 mm, and more preferably 0.5 to<br>
2.0 mm. Similarly, the rubber outer layer may have a<br>
thickness of 0.2 to 4.0 mm, and more preferably 0.5 to 2.0 mm.<br>
[0057]<br><reinforcement layer><br>
The reinforcement layer is the layer formed in the<br>
exterior of the rubber inner layer as described above for the<br>
purpose of maintaining the strength of the product.<br>
In the present invention, the reinforcement layer may<br>
comprise either a braid or a coil, and the material used for<br><br>
the reinforcement layer is not particularly limited.<br>
Exemplary preferable materials include polyester fibers,<br>
polyamide fibers, alamid fibers, vinilon fibers, rayon fibers,<br>
PBO (polyparaphenylene benzobisoxazole) fibers, polyallylate<br>

also comprise a metal reinforcement layer, and the metal<br>
materials used for such reinforcement layer is also not<br>
limited. Exemplary preferable metal materials include hard<br>
steel wire (brass plated wires).<br>
Among these, the preferred are polyester fibers and<br>

resistance, and fatigue resistance.<br>
[0058]<br>
The method used for producing the hose of the present<br>
invention comprising the rubber layer and the reinforcement<br>
layer is not particularly limited, and any method known in the<br>
art can be used in producing such hose of the present<br>
invention.<br>
In an exemplary process, the rubber inner layer, the<br>
reinforcement layer, and the rubber outer layer may be<br>
disposed in this order on a mandrel, and these layers may be<br>
adhered by press vulcanization, vapor vulcanization, oven<br>
vulcanization (hot air vulcanization), or hot water<br><br>
vulcanization conducted for 30 to 180 minutes under the<br>
conditions of 140 to 190°C.<br>
Examples<br>
[0059]<br>
Next, the rubber composition of the present invention is<br>
described in detail by referring to the Examples which by no<br>
means limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
[0060]<br>
(Examples 1 to 14 and Comparative Examples 1 to 14)<br>
The components shown in Table 1 were blended at the<br>
ratio (part by weight) shown in Table 1 to prepare the rubber<br>
composition.<br>
More specifically, the components shown in Table 1<br>
except for the crosslinking agent 1 were kneaded in Banbury<br>
mixer (3.4 liters) for 4 minutes, and the content was removed<br>
from the mixer when the temperature reached 140°C. The master<br>
batch was thereby obtained.<br>
Next, the crosslinking agent 1 was kneaded with the thus<br>
obtained master batch by open rolls to prepare the rubber<br>
composition.<br>
The thus obtained rubber compositions were evaluated for<br>
their tensile properties after vulcanization, resistance to<br>
thermal aging, oil resistance, adhesion, and resistance to<br><br>
degradation by zinc by the procedure as described below. The<br>
results are shown in Table 1.<br>
[0061]<br>
(1) Tensile properties<br>
The resulting rubber composition was vulcanized for 60<br>
minutes by using a press molding machine at 157°C under the<br>
surface pressure of 3.0 MPa to produce a vulcanized sheet<br>
having a thickness of 2 mm. JIS No. 3 dumbbell test pieces<br>
were blanked from this sheet, and tensile test was conducted<br>
in accordance with JIS K6251-2004 at a tensile speed of 500<br>
mm/minute to measure tensile strength (TB)[MPa], elongation at<br>
break (EB)[%], and 50% modulus {M50) [MPa] at room temperature.<br>
[0062]<br>
(2)	Resistance to thermal aging<br>
The same vulcanized sheet having a thickness of 2 mm as<br>
one used in measuring the tensile properties was left in an<br>
oven at 150°C for 72 hours, and the sheet was measured for the<br>
elongation at break (EB) [%] in accordance with JIS K6251-2004.<br>
[0063]<br>
(3)	Oil resistance<br>
The same vulcanized sheet having a thickness of 2 mm as<br>
one used in evaluating the tensile properties was immersed in<br>
a test oil (IRM 903, manufactured by Japan Sun Oil<br><br>
Corporation., Ltd.) at 150°C for 72 hours, and elongation "at<br>
break (EB) [%] after the immersion was measured by JIS K6258-<br>
2003.<br>
[0064]<br>
(4) Adhesion<br>
A test piece in the shape of a hose comprising a rubber<br>
outer layer comprising the thus obtained rubber composition<br>
and a reinforcement layer comprising the nylon 66 fibers<br>
(comprising 3 twisted 1000 dtex strands) which had been dipped<br>
in RFL solution was prepared by the procedure as described<br>
below.<br>
The nylon 66 fibers were braided on a mandrel having an<br>
outer diameter of 34 mm to form the reinforcement layer.<br>
Next, an unvulcanized sheet having a thickness of 2.5 mm<br>
was formed by using the products of Examples 1 to 14 and<br>
Comparative Examples 1 to 14, and this sheet was adhered on<br>
the reinforcement layer. This test piece was then vulcanized<br>
to prepare the vulcanized test piece.<br>
The rubber outer layer was peeled off the hose-shaped<br>
test piece at a peeling speed of 50 mm/min to measure the<br>
adhesion strength (unit: N per width of 25 mm).<br>
[0065]<br>
(5) Resistance to degradation by zinc<br><br>
The same vulcanized sheet having a thickness of 2 mm as<br>
one used in measuring the tensile properties was brought in<br>
contact with a zinc sheet, and after compressing the laminate<br>
by 20%, the sheet was left in an oven at 150°C for 72 hours.<br>
The laminate was allowed to cool to room temperature,<br>
and the vulcanized sheet was separated from the zinc sheet.<br>
The vulcanized sheet was bent at an angle of 180°C by using a<br>
clip, and the surface on the side that had been in contact<br>
with the zinc sheet was checked for the generation of cracks<br>
by using a microscope (at a magnification of 100). When<br>
cracks were found, their average length was measured.<br>
