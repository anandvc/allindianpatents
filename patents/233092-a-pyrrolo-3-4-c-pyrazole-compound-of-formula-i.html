As formerly indicated, a further object of the present invention is represented by the process for preparing the compounds of formula (I) and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, which process comprises:<br>
a) reacting a compound of formula (II) with a compound of formula (II!) <br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br><br>
wherein R and X are as above defined, Q is a lower alkyl group, t-Bu repres Z is hydroxy or a suitable leaving group, so as to obtain a compound of form<br>
 (IV)<br><br>
;nts tert-butyl and Jla (IV)<br><br>
5       b) reacting the compound of formula (IV) under acidic conditions so as to obtain a compound of formula (V) lt thereof.<br><br>
as to obtain the<br>
pharmaceutically<br><br><br><br>
The above process is an analogy process, which can be carried out by wor, very well-known operative conditions.<br><br>
;ing according to<br><br>
According to step (a) of the process, the reaction between the compounds of formula (II) and<br>
(III) can be carried out in a variety of ways, according to conventional methods for acylating<br>
j amino derivatives. As an example, the compound of formula (II) may be reacted with an acyl<br>
chloride of formula (III) wherein Z represents, as a suitable leaving group, a chlorine atom.<br>
Preferably, this reaction is carried out at a temperature ranging from room temperature to about 60°C, in a suitable solvent such as, for instance, tetrahydrofuran or c'ichloromethane,<br><br>
and in the presence of a proton scavenger such as triethylamine or diisopropy<br><br>
ethylamine.<br><br>
Within the compounds of formula (II) Q represents a lower alky) group, for hstance a alkyl group, more preferably methyl or ethyl.<br>
According to step (b) of the process, the compound of formula (IV) is easily deprotected at the pirrolidine nitrogen atom, by acidic treatment.<br><br>
acid such ble solvent such at a temperature about 1 hour to<br>
This reaction can be conveniently carried out in the presence of a mineral or organic as, for instance, hydrochloric, trifluoroacetic or methansulfonic acid, in a suit; as dichloromethane, 1,4-dioxane, a lower alcohol (e.g. methanol or ethanol), ranging from room temperature to about 40°C and for a time varying from about 48 hours.<br><br>
The compound of formula (V) thus obtained is further reacted, according to step (c) of the process, with a compound of formula (VI). From the above it is clear to the skilled person that also this acylation reaction may be accomplished in a variety of ways and operative conditions, which are widely known in the art for the preparation of carboxamides.<br>
The reaction between a compound of formula (V) and a carboxylic acid of formula (VI) wherein<br><br>
Z' is hydroxy can be carried out in the presence of a coupling agent such<br><br>
as, for instance,<br><br><br><br>
carbodiimide,      i.e.      1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide,       1,3-diisopropylcarbcdiimide,       1-(3-<br>
polystyrene or N-cyclohexylcarbodiimide-N'-methyl polystyrene, in a suitable<br>
dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide,<br><br>
N-cyclohexylcarbodiimide-N'<br><br>
propyloxymethyl solvent such as,<br><br>
for   instance,   dichioromethane,   chloroform,   telrahydrofuran,   diethyl   eth^r,   1,4-dioxane, acetonitrile, toluene, or N.N-dimethylformamide at a temperature ranging fron about -10°C to<br><br>
reflux lor a suitable time, i.e. from about 30 minutes to about 96 hours. The<br><br>
said reaction is<br><br>
optionally carried out in the presence of a suitable catalyst, for instance 4-<br>
dimethylaminopyridine, or in the presence of a further coupling reagent such as N-<br>
hydroxybenzotriazole.	!<br>
The reaction between a compound of formula (V) and a compound of formula (VI) can be also carried out, for example, through a mixed anhydride method, by using an alkyl chloroformate, such as ethyl, iso-butyl, or iso-propyl chloroformate, in the presence of a tertiary base, such as triethylamine, N,N-diisopropylethylamine or pyridine, in a suitable solve it such as, for<br><br>
3, diethyl ether,<br>
instance, toluene, dichloromethane, chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitri<br>
1,4-dioxane, or N,N-dimethylformamide, at a temperature ranging from abou   -30°C to room temperature.<br><br>
The reaction between a compound of formula (V) and a carboxylic derivative of formula (VI) wherein 2' is a suitable leaving group can be carried out in the presence of a tertiary base such as triethylamine, N,N-diisopropylethylamine or pyridine, in a suitable solvent, such as toluene, dichloromethane, chloroform, diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, or N,N-dirnethylformamide, at a temperature ranging from about -10°C to reflux.<br>
The compounds of formula (VI) are characterised by the presence of an asymmetric carbon atom being linked to R, and presently noted with an asterisk<br>
O<br>
R.<br>
(VI)<br>
Hence, the compounds of formula (VI) may be either in the form of single en'antiomers or as mixtures thereof, also comprehensive of racemic mixtures.<br><br>
usejd in the process riroperly  defined<br>
Clearly, depending upon the nature of the compound of formula (VI) being of the  invention,   corresponding  compounds of formula  (VII)  having  a stereochemistry at this same carbon atom could be thus obtained.<br><br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, step (c) is carried out by reacting a suitable compound of formula (Vi), which is in a given enantiomeric form.<br>
Likewise, if racemic mixtures of the compound of formula (VI) are employed and whenever final compounds of formula (I) in optical pure form are desired, optical resolution of the intermediate compound of formula (VII) or, alternatively, of the final compound of formula (I) will be required, by working according to conventional means. Just sis an example, conventional techniques for racemate resolution include, for instarce, partitioned crystallization of diastereoisomeric salt derivatives or preparative chiral HPLC.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
Finally, according to step (d) of the process, the compound of formula (VII) is deprotected at the pyrazole nitrogen atom by working according to conventional methods enabling, for instance, the selective hydrolysis of the carbamate group.<br><br>
• instance in the as triethylamine, tetrahydrofuran, ranging from to about 96<br>
As an example, this reaction may be carried out under basic conditions, fo presence of sodium, potassium or lithium hydroxide, or a tertiary amine such and in a suitable solvent such as N,N-dimethy!formarnide, methanol, ethanol water and mixtures thereof. Typically, the reaction is carried out at temperatures room temperature to about 60°C and for a time varying from about 30 minptes hours.<br><br>
Finally, pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of formula (1) or, ialternatively, the free compounds from their salts thereof may be all obtained according!to conventional methods.<br>
The starting material of the process of the invention are known or easily prepared according to knwon methods.<br><br>
represents ethyl is /12242 (see, in as 3-amino-4,6-iter).<br>
As an example, the preparation of the compound of formula (11) wherein Q disclosed  in Jhe  aforementioned  international  patent application  WO  02 particular, example 26 at page 249; this same compound is therein named dihydro-pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyra?:Dle-1,5-dicarboxylic acid 5-tert-butyl ester 'I-ethyl e<br><br>
By working in an analogous way, additional compounds of formula (II) whereip Q represents a lower alkyl group other than ethyl can be thus prepared as well.<br>
i<br>
The compounds of formula (111) and (VI), for instance those wherein Z and Z' represent a halogen atom, e.g. a chlorine atom, are either known or can be easily obtained from the corresponding known carboxylic acids, by working according to conventional methods.<br>
Likewise, it is also clear to the person skilled in the art that if a compound of formula (I), prepared according to the above process comprehensive of any variant thereof, is obtained as an admixture of isomers, their separation into the single isomers of formula (I), carried out according to conventional techniques, is still within the scope of the present in/ention.<br><br>
PHARMACOLOGY<br>
The compounds of formula (1) are active as protein kinase inhibitors, more particularly as Aurora kinases inhibitors and are therefore useful, for instance, to restrict the unregulated proliferation ot tumor cells.<br>
In therapy, They may be used in the treatment of various tumors, such as those formerly reported, as well as in the treatment of other cell proliferative disorders such as psoriasis, vascular smooth cell proliferation associated with atherosclerosis and post-surgical stenosis and restenosis.<br>
The inhibiting activity and the potency of selected compounds is determined through a method<br><br>
of assay based on the use of the SPA technology (Amersham Pharmacia Bio1<br><br>
ich).<br><br>
The assay consists of the transfer of radioactivity labelled phosphate moiety ty the kinase to a<br><br>
biotinylated substrate. The resulting 33P-labelied biotinylated product is al<br><br>
owed to bind to<br><br>
streptavidin-coated SPA beads (biotin capacity 130 pmol/mg), and light emitted was measured in a scintillation counter.<br>
Inhibition assay of Aurora-2 activity<br>
\\insse reaction: 8 uM biotinylated peptide (4 repeats of LRRWSLG), 10 uM ATP (0.5 uCi P^y-ATP), 7 fi ng Aurora 2, inhibitor in a finsit volume of 30 ul buffer (HEPES 50 mWI pH 7.0,<br>
to each well of a<br>
in, reaction was<br>
MgCl2 10 ruM, ! mM DTT, 0.2 mg/ml BSA. 3 uM orthovanadate) were added 96 U bottom well plate. After 60 minutes at room temperature incubati stopped and biotinylated peptide captured by adding 100 ul of bead suspension.<br>
Stratification: 100 pi of CsCI2 5 M were added to each well and let starjicf 4 hour before radioactivity was counted in the Top-Count instrument.<br>
1C50 determination: inhibitors were tested at different concentrations ranging from 0.0015 to<br>
10 uM. Experimental data were analyzed by the computer program GraphPaiji Prizm using the<br>
four parameter logistic equation:<br>
y = bottom+(lop-bottom)/(1-*-10A((loglC50-x)*s|ope))<br>
where x is tin; logarithm of the inhibitor concentration, y is the response; y starts at bottom and<br>
goes lo top with a sigrnoid shape.<br><br>
Ki calculation:<br>
Experimental method: Reaction was carried out in buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7[5, 10 mM MgCI2, 0.2 rng/ml BSA, 7.5 mM DTT) containing 3.7 nM enzyme, histone and ATP {constant ratio of cold/labeled ATP 1/3000). Reaction was stopped with EDTA and the substrate captured on phosphomembrane (Multiscreen 96 well plates from Millipore). After extensive washing, the multiscreen plates were read on a top counter. Control (time zero) for each ATP and histone concentrations was measured.<br>
Experimental design: Reaction velocities are measured at four ATP, substrate (histone) and inhibitor concentrations. An 80-point concentration matrix was designed around the respective ATP and substrate Km values, and the inhibitor IC50 values (0.3, 1, 3, 9 folJ the Km or IC50 values). A preliminary time course experiment in the absence of inhibitor and at the different ATP and substrate concentrations allows the selection of a single endpoin1 time (10 min) in the linear range of the reaction for the Ki determination experiment.<br>
Kinetic parameter estimates: Kinetic parameters were estimated by simultaneous nonlinear least-square regression using [Eq.1] (competitive inhibitor respect to ATP, random mechanism) using the complete data set (80 points):<br><br>
