				<td>The present invention relates to a multi step process for the preparation of 4,5-diamino Chichimec acid derivatives, especially for the preparation of (3R,4R,5S)-4-acetamido-5-amino-3-(l-ethylpropoxy)-l-cyclohexene-l-carboxylic acid ethyl ester and its pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts starting from furan as well as new specific intermediates.<br>
4,5-diamino shikimic acid derivatives, especially the (3R,4R,5S)-4-acetamido-5-amino-3-(l-ethylpropoxy)-l-cyclohexene-l-carboxylic acid ethyl ester and its pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts are potent inhibitors of viral neuraminidase ( J.C.Rohloff et al., J.Org.Chem., 1998, 63, 4545-4550; WO 98/07685).<br>
A multi step synthesis of (3R,4R,5S)-4-acetamido-5-amino-3-(l-ethylpropoxy)-l-cyclohexene-1-carboxylic acid ethyl ester from (-)-quince acid or (-)-Chichimec acid is described in (J.C.Rohloff et al, loc.cit.).<br>
Both (-)-quinic acid and (-)-shikimic acid are starting compounds which are rather expensive and hardly accessible in technical quantities. A multi step synthesis capable to run on a technical scale should therefore preferably be based on starting compounds which are more attractive in price and available in technical quantities.<br>
Object of the present invention therefore is to provide such a new access to the 4,5-diamino shikimic acid derivatives mentioned above in good yields and excellent quality.<br>
It was found that with the synthesis according to claim 1 this object could surprisingly be achieved.<br>
The present invention therefore relates to a process for the preparation of a 4,5-diamino shikimic acid derivative of formula<br>

wherein R1, R2 and R5 are as above and R6 is a subsistent of an OH group, in<br><br>
step f)<br>
R5 is removed to yield a 4-amino cyclohexene derivative of formula<br><br>
wherein R1, R2 and R6 are as above<br>
this 4-amino cyclohexene derivative of formula (VII) is finally processed to the 4,5-diamino shikimic acid derivatives of formula (I) by<br>

wherein R' and R' are as above,<br>

R7 and R8 are H<br>
g22 vacillation of the amino group in position 4 and<br>
g23 releasing the amino group in position 5 and, if necessary the formation of the pharmaceutically acceptable addition salt.<br><br>
The term alkyl in R'1 has the meaning of a straight chained or branched alkyl group of 1 to 20 C-atoms, expediently of 1 to 12 C-atoms. Examples of such alkyl groups are methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, i-propyl, n-butyl, i-butyl, tert.-butyl, pentyl and its isomers, hexyl and its isomers, hotly and its isomers, octyl and its isomers, nonyl and its isomers, dactyl and its isomers, unequal and its isomers and dodecyl and its isomers.<br>
&gt;<br>
This alkyl group can be substituted with one or more substituents as defined in e.g. WO 98/07685. Suitable substituents are alkyl of 1 to 20 C-atoms (as defined above), alkenyl with 2 to 20 C-atoms, cycloalkyl with 3 to 6 C-atoms, hydroxy, alloys with 1 to 20 C-atoms, alkoxycarbonyl with 1 to 20 C-atoms, F, CI, Br, and J. Preferred meaning forR'isl-ethylpropyl.<br>
R" is a straight chained or branched alkyl group of 1 to 12 C-atoms, expediently of 1 to 6 C-atoms, as exemplified above.<br>
Preferred meaning for R2 is ethyl.<br>
The substituent R6 refers to any substitute for OH groups conventionally used and kno\s'n in the art. They are described e.g. in "Compendium of Organic Methods" or in "Advanced Organic Chemistry", ed. March J., John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1992, 353-357.<br>
Preferably R6 is a sulfonyl group, more preferably optionally substituted aryl sulfonyl or alkyl sulfonyl such as p-toluenesulfonyl, p-nitrobenzenesulfonyl, p-bromo benzenesulfonyl, trifluoromethanesulfonyl or methanesulfonyl, most preferably methanesulfonyl.<br>
The term substituent of an amino group in R" and R** or R' and R^ refers to any substituent conventionally used and known in the art. They are described e.g. in "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry", Theodora W. Greene et al., John Wiley 8<sons inc. new york suitable substituents are also given in e.g. the wo></sons>
Preferred substituents for R3 and R4 are alkanoyl groups, more preferably lower alkanoyl with 1 to 6 C-atoms such as humanely, pentanoyl, butanoyl (butyryl), propanoyl (propionyl), ethanoyl (acetyl) and methanoyl (formal). Preferred alkanoyl group and therefore preferred meaning for R' is acetyl and for R^ is H.<br><br>
Preferred substituent for R7 and R8 is straight chained or branched alkenyl with 2 to 6 C-atoms, preferably ally or an analog thereof. Suitable analog of alkyl is an alkyl group which is substituted on the a-, j8-or y-carbon by one lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, lower alkynes or aryl group. Suitable examples are e.g. 2-methylallyl, 3,3-dimethylallyl, 2-phenylallyl, or 3-<br>
methallyl. Most preferred meaning for R^ is alkyl and for R* is H.<br>
.'<br>
Preferred 4,5-diamino shikimic acid derivative of formula (I) is the (3R,4R,5S)-4-acetamido-5-amino-3-(l-ethylpropoxy)-l-cyclohexene-l-carboxylic acid ethyl ester and the ethyl (3R,4R,5S)-4-acetamido-5-amino-3-(l-ethylpropoxy)-l-cyclohexene-l-carboxyl ate Phosphate (1:1)<br>
Step a)<br>
Step a) comprises a Diels-Alder reaction of furan with an acrylic acid derivative. Diels-Alder reactions per se are known to the skilled in the art (see e.g. Tetrahedron Letters, 23, 1982, 5299-5302). The present conversion can therefore be performed following the methods and conditions described in the art.<br>
Suitable derivatives of an acrylic acid are the esters and the amides, preferably the esters, more preferably lower alkyl esters of acrylic acid.<br>
Usually this type of reaction needs the presence of Lewis acids. Suitable Lewis acids are magnesium halogenides such as magnesium chloride, magnesium bromide or magnesium iodide or zinc halogenides such as zinc chloride, zinc bromide or zinc iodide. Preferred Lewis acid was found to be zinc chloride.<br>
As a rule catalytic amounts of the Lewis acid are applied, however it was surprisingly found that stoechiometric amounts or even an excess of the Lewis acid, preferably of zinc chloride within a reasonable time lead to an excellent exo/endo ratio of the bicycle compound of formula (III) of up to 9:1.<br>
Preferably stoechiometric amounts of zinc chloride are used.<br><br>
!]convenient solvent for step a) is the reactant acrylic acid derivative itself, used m an excess of up to 50%. It is however always possible to add an inert solvent.<br>
The reaction temperature can be chosen in the range of 20°C to 70°C.<br>
\fter termination of the reaction work up can take place using methods well known to the skilled in the art.<br>
Step b)<br>
Step b) comprises separation of the 2R-exo isomer of the bicycio compound of formula (III), preferably of the optical pure 2R-exo isomer of the bicycio compound of formula (III).<br>
Step a) provides the racemate of an exo/endo mixture of the bicycio compound, wherein the exo form in the mixture is enriched up to a ratio of 9:1.<br>
As a principle separation of endo and exo forms of a compound can take place by taking advantage of the different physical properties of these forms such as different boiling points. Separation of each of the two optical isomers however have to take place either by classical racemate resolution techniques or by a stereo selective methods, e.g. by an enzymatic approach.<br>
The desired 2R-exo form of the bicycio compound can accordingly be gained by physical separation of the exo and endo form e.g. by distillation, by converting the exo-ester into the respective acid and finally by a subsequent racemate resolution using classical resolving agents such as (-)-ephedrine hydrochloride or S-(-)-l-phenyl ethylamine.<br><br>
Preferably, however the exo/endo mixture of step a) is treated with an enzyme which is capable to hydrolyze specifically the 2S-exo isomer only and which is leaving the 2R-exo isomer untouched. It was found that ideally lipases of the EC class 3.1.1.3 or lipoprotein lipases of the EC class 3.1.1.34 are used. Suitable representatives of tl?ese classes are lipases of the genus Candida, more preferably of Candida antarctica. Such lipases are commercially available. Most preferred enzyme is the B-form of lipase Candida antarctica<br>
vv^hich is offered under the tradename Chirazyme©L2 from Roche Diagnostics or as Lipase SP-525 from Novo Nordisk.<br>
As a common alternative immobilized enzymes maybe used.<br>
The reaction is usually carried out in a monophasic or biphasic aqueous system, preferably in a biphasic system with an polar solvent as co-solvent. Suitable co-solvents are alkenes, cycloalkanes or cycloalkenes. Cyclohexane, cyclohexene and octane was found to be the most preferred co-solvent.<br>
The common aqueous buffer solutions known to be used for biochemical conversions are used in order to maintain the pH in the range of 6.5 to 8.0. Suitably sodium or potassium phosphate buffers or borate buffers can be applied. Such a buffer solution can additionally contain NaCl or KCl in a concentration of 50 to 300 mM. A preferred buffering system could e.g. contain 0.1 M KCl and 5 mM potassium borate pH 7.5.<br>
The ratio organic solvent / aqueous phase is in the range of 1:10 to 3:2. Overall substrate concentration is expediently chosen in the range of 5 to 20 wt.%, preferably in the range of 5 to 10 wt.%.<br>
Suitable reaction temperature is 0°C to 25°C, preferably close to freezing temperature of the reaction mixture.<br><br>
The resulting 2S-exo acid is preferably neutralized by the controlled addition of a base such as NaOH or KOH, whereby the unleaded 2R-exo ester together with the endo isomers remains in the organic phase and is separated by way of extraction with a common organic solvent.<br>
Separation of the 2R-exo ester from the endo isomers can take place by a distillation in vacuous, preferably at a temperature in the range of 70°C and 100°C and a pressure of 0.1 mbar to 10 mbar.<br>
Step c)<br>
Step c) comprises the reaction of the 2R-exo isomer of the bicyclo compound of formula (III) with an azide.<br>
Suitable azides are found to be these which are capable to form an aziridine ring in endo-position to the bridgehead of the bicyclic system. Unexpectedly phosphoryl azides of the formula<br>
wherein R   is dialkoxyphosphoryl or diaryloxyphosphoryl, preferably diaryloxyphosphoryl, most preferably diphenyloxyphosphoryl fulfilled this task.<br>
Most preferred phosphoryl azide is the diphenyloxy-phosphoryl azide (DPPA).<br>
The preference of DPPA is mainly based on its availability in technical quantities and its lower toxicity compared to the dialkoxyphosphoryl azides.<br>
The phosphoryl azide is conveniently added in an amount of 0.8 equivalents to 1.0 equivalents relating to the 2R-exo bicyclo compound gained in step b). Preferably stoechiometric amounts of the phosphoryl azide are added.<br>
The choice of a solvent is not critical as long as it is inert to the reactants. Toluene or dioxins were found to be suitable solvents.<br><br>
The reaction temperature is chosen expediently between 40°C and 80°C.<br>
In case R  has the preferred meaning of diaryloxy phosphoryl, a trarliesterification can be performed to transform the diaryloxy phosphoryl group into a dialkoxy phosphoryl group.<br>
Accordingly the azide residue R5 is dialkoxy-phosphoryl, preferably di-(Ci.6) alkoxy-phosphoryl, most preferably dithery-phosphoryl. Transesterifications are methods known to the skilled in the art, but as a rule take place in the presence of an alcoholate in the corresponding alcohol. Within the most preferred method transesterification takes place in the presence of sodium ethanol ate in ethanol.<br>
Step d)<br>
Step d) comprises eliminative ring opening of the aziridine of formula (IV) to the cyclohexene aziridine derivative of formula (V).<br>
This reaction is performed in the presence of a strong organic base. Expediently alkali-bis -(trialkylsilyl) amides, preferably alkali-bis-(trimethylsilyl) amides such as lithium bis-(trimethylsilyl) amide, sodium-bis-(trimethylsilyl) amide or potassium-bis-(trimethylsilyl) amide are used.<br>
Usually the strong organic base is used in amount of 1.0 equivalent to 2.5 equivalents relating to one equivalent of the aziridine of formula (V).<br>
The choice of a solvent also for this step is not critical as long as it is inert to the reactants. Dioxins or tetrahydrofuran were found to be suitable solvents.<br><br>
The reaction temperature is expediently maintained in the range of-80°C to 0°C, preferably in the range of-80°C to -20°C.<br>
The cyclohexene aziridine of formula (V) can be isolated after an acidic work up applying methods known to the skilled in the art.<br>
Step e)<br>
Step e) comprises introduction of a substituent R^ in the free OH-position and ring opening of the aziridine ring to give cyclohexene derivatives of formula (VI).<br>
The sequence, however can also be changed such that ring opening is first and introduction of substituent R^ in the free OH-position comes second. Preferably however is to first introduce substituent R into the free OH-position and to perform ring opening as second step.<br>
Compounds and methods for effecting such a substitution are well known in the art and described e.g. in "Compendium of Organic Methods" or in "Advanced Organic Chemistry", ed. March J., John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1992, 353-357.<br>
It was found that the hydroxy group is preferably transformed into a sulfonic acid ester, R therefore preferably is a sulfonyl group, more preferably optionally substituted aryl sulfonyl or alkyl sulfonyl such as p-toluenesulfonyl, p-nitrobenzenesulfonyl, p-broom benzenesulfonyl, trifluoromethanesulfonyl or methanesulfonyl, most preferably methanesulfonyl.<br>
Agents commonly used for producing sulfonic acid esters e.g. are the halogenides or the anhydrides of the following sulfonic acids: methanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid a p-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid, p-bromobenzenesulfonic acid or trifluoromethanesulfonic acid.<br><br>
Preferred agent is a halogenide or anhydride of methanesulfonic acid such as methane sulfonylchloride.<br>
The sulfonylating agent is expediently added in an amount of 1.0 to 1.2 equivalents relating<br>
to one equivalent of the cyclohexene aziridine of formula (V).	'<br>
Usually the reaction takes place in an inert solvent such as in ethylacetate, at a reaction temperature of 0°C to 20°C and in the pretence of an organic base.<br>
For effecting the ring opening of the aziridine ring further the 0-substituted cyclopean derivative of formula (V) is converted with an alcohol R'OH, wherein R' is as above, in the presence of a Lewis acid. Following the preferences of R given above most suitable alcohol is pentane-3-ol.<br>
A suitable Lewis acid is e.g. bortrifluoride ethyl iterate which is usually added in an amount of 1.0 equivalent to 1.5 equivalents relating to one equivalent of the cyclohexene aziridine of formula (V).<br>
The reaction expediently takes place in an inert solvent such as in a halogenated hydrocarbon like methylene chloride at temperatures between 0°C and 40°C.<br>
Alternatively the reaction can be performed without extra solvent thereby using the respective alcohol in sufficient excess.<br>
Step f)<br>
Step f) covers the removal of R5 to yield the 4-amino cyclohexene derivative of formula (VII).<br><br>
R as outlined above preferably being daily phosphoryl is advantageously spitted off<br>
using strong acidic conditions. Suitably a strong mineral acid such as sulfuric acid can be<br>
used. In order to achieve better crystallization the sulfate formed can be transformed with<br>
hydrochloric acid into the hydro chloride.	,,<br>
The reaction conveniently takes place in a polar organic solvent such as in alcohols, preferably in alcohols which correspond to the ester residue R".<br>
Step g)<br>
As shown above step g) offers two different ways to come to the 4,5-diamino shikimic cid derivative of formula (I).<br>
One way comprising the steps gin to g23 passes an azide intermediate , whereby the other way comprising steps g21to g23 follows an azide free route. Preferred route is the azide free route g21 to g23.<br>
Steps gii to gi3<br>
Step-in)<br>
The transformation of the 4-amino cyclohexene derivative of formula (VII) to the aziridine of formula (VIII) can happen by reaction with a tertiary amine in the presence of an inert solvent.<br>
Preferably triethylamine is selected as tertiary amine.<br><br>
The tertiary amine as a rule is applied in amounts of 2.0 equivalents to 2.5 equivalents relating to one equivalent of 4-amino cyclohexene derivative of formula (VII).<br>
The choice of solvents is not critical. Good results have been achieved with ethylacetate or tetrahydrofuran.<br>
The reaction usually takes place at a temperature of 40°C to 80°C.<br>
steps gi2, gl3<br>
These steps comprise the conversion of the aziridine of formula (VIII) to an azide and the subsequent reduction to the end product. These steps are known in the art and can be processed following the disclosure in scheme 5 of J.C.Rohloff et al., J.Org.Chem., 1998, 63, 4545-4550 and the corresponding experimental part thereof, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Steps g21 to g23<br>
stepg2i)<br>
Step g21) comprises the transformation of the 4-amino cyclohexene derivative of formula (VII) into a 5-N-substituted-4,5-diamino shikimic acid derivative of formula (X).<br>
This transformation is expediently effected with an amine o f formula R'NHR', wherein R' and R8 have the meaning as stated above. Preferred amines are allylamine, diallylamine or 2-methylallylamine whereby allylamine is the most preferred.<br><br>
In order to release the amine the salt of the 4-amino cyclohexene derivative of formula (VII) as obtained in step f) is expediently neutralized first, either by addition of a common inorganic base such as sodium bicarbonate or by using the amine formula R^NHR* in excess.<br>
The reaction with the amine itself can be performed in an inert solvent, applying either normal or elevated pressure at temperatures of 20°C to 150°C. As a suitable solvent tert.-butyl methyl ether can be selected.<br>
Step g22)<br>
Step g::) comprises the acylation of the free amino function of the 5-N-substituted 4,5-diamino shikimic acid derivative of formula (X).<br>
Acylation can be effected under strong acidic conditions by using acylating agents known to the skilled in the art. Acylating agent can be an aliphatic or aromatic carboxylic acid, or an activated derivative thereof, such as an acyl halide, a carboxylic acid ester or a carboxylic acid anhydride. Suitable acylating agent preferably is an acetylating agent such as acetylchloride, trifluoracteylchloride or acetic anhydride. Suitable aromatic acylating agent is benzoylchloride. Strong acids suitably used e.g. are mixtures of methanesulfonic acid and acetic acid or sulfuric acid and acetic acid.<br>
Vacillations however can also take place under non acidic conditions using e.g. N-acetyl-imidazole or N-acetyl-N-methoxy-acetamide.<br>
Preferably however the acylation takes place under acidic conditions using 0.5 to 2.0 equivalents of acetic anhydride, 0 to 15.0 equivalents of acetic acid and 0 to 2.0 equivalents of methanesulfonic acid in ethyl acetate.<br><br>
An inert solvent such as tert.-butyl methyl ether may be added, it is however also possible to run the reaction without addition of any solvent.<br>
The temperature is as a rule chosen in the range of-20°C to 100°C.<br>
Step g23)<br>
Step g23) comprises release of the amino group in position 5 and, if necessary, further transformation of the resulting 4,5-diamino shikimic acid derivative of formula (I) into a pharmaceutically acceptable addition salt.<br>
Release of the amino group is expediently effected by isomerization/hydrolysis in the presence of a suitable metal catalyst. Expediently a precious metal catalyst such as Pt, Pd or Rh either applied on an inert support such as charcoal or alumina, or in complexes form can be used. Preferred catalyst is 5 to 10% palladium on carbon (Pd/C).<br>
The catalyst is suitably used in an amount of 2 to 30 wt.%, preferably, 5 to 20 vvt.% relating to the 5-N-substituted 4,5-diamino shikimic acid derivative of formula (X).<br>
The isomerization/hydrolysis is advantageously carried out in an aqueous solvent. The solvent itself can be protic or aprotic. Suitable protic solvents are e.g. alcohols such as methanol, ethanol or isopropanol. Suitable aprotic solvent is e.g. acetonitrile or dioxide.<br>
The reaction temperature is preferably chosen in the range of 20°C and 150°C.<br>
It was found that isomerization/hydrolysis is preferably effected in the presence of a primary amine.<br>
Primary amines suitably used are ethylenediamine or ethanolamine, or suitable derivatives thereof A particularly interesting primary amine is ethanolamine.<br>
The primary amine is suitably used in an amount of 1.0 to 1.25 equivalents, preferably of 1.05 to 1.15 equivalents relating to the 5-N-substituted 4,5-diamino shikimic acid derivative of formula (X).<br><br>
In order to completely hydrolyze any imines that may have formed in this step the reaction mixture is usually treated with a mineral acid e.g. with sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid.<br>
