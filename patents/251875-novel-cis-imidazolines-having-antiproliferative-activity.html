Novel ClS-ImidazoIines This invention is related to at least one compound selected from a compound of formula I<br><br>
or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, wherein X1, X2, X3, R, Yi andY2 are described in this application. These compounds are believed to inhibit the interaction of MDM2 protein with a p-53-like peptide and have antiproliferative activity.<br>
p53 is a tumor suppresser protein that plays a central role in protection against development of cancer. It guards cellular integrity and prevents the propagation of permanently damaged clones of cells by the induction of growth arrest or apoptosis. At the molecular level, p53 is a transcription factor that can activate a panel of genes implicated in the regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis. p53 is a potent cell cycle inhibitor which is tightly regulated by MDM2 at the cellular level. MDM2 and p53 form a feedback control loop. MDM2 can bind p53 and inhibit its ability to transactivate p53-regulated genes. In addition, MDM2 mediates the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of p53. p53 can activate the expression of the MDM2 gene, thus raising the cellular level of MDM2 protein. This feedback control loop insures that both MDM2 and p53 are kept at a low level in normal proliferating cells. MDM2 is also a cofactor for E2F, which plays a central role in cell cycle regulation.<br><br>
The ratio of MDM2 to p53 (E2F) is dysregulated in many cancers. Frequently occurring molecular defects in the p!6INK4/pl9ARF locus, for instance, have been shown to affect MDM2 protein degradation. Inhibition of MDM2-p53 interaction in tumor cells with wild-type p53 should lead to accumulation of p53, cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. MDM2 antagonists, therefore, can offer a novel approach to cancer therapy as single agents or in combination with a broad spectrum of other antitumor therapies. The feasibility of this strategy has been shown by the use of different macromolecular tools for inhibition of MDM2-p53 interaction (e.g. antibodies, antisense oligonucleotides, peptides). MDM2 also binds E2F through a conserved binding region as p53 and activates E2F-dependent transcription of cyclin A, suggesting that MDM2 antagonists might have effects in p53 mutant cells.<br>
Wells et al. •/. Org, Chem., 1972, 37, 2158-2161, report synthesis of imidazolines. Hunter et al., Can. J. Chem.9 1972, Vol. 50, pgs. 669-77, report the preparation of amarine and isoamarine compounds which had previously been studied for chemiluminescence (McCapra et al. Photochem. and Photobiol. 1965,4, 1111-1121). Zupanc et al. Bull. Soc. Chem. &amp; Tech. (Yugoslavia) 1980-81, 27/28, 71-80, report the use of triaryl imidazolines as starting materials in the preparation of EDTA derivatives.<br>
EP 363 061 to Matsumoto reports imidazoline derivatives useful as immunomodulators. The compounds were indicated to have low toxicity. Treatment and/or prevention of rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus, erythemathodes, and rheumatic fever were implicated.   WO 00/78725 to Choueiry et al. report a method for making substituted amidine compounds, and indicate that imidazoline-type compounds may be useful in the treatment of diabetes or related diseases involving impaired glucose disposal.<br>
US 6r617,346 Bl issued September 9, 2003 and US 6,734,302 B2 issued May 11, 2004 disclose related racemic cis-imidazolines.<br><br>
The present invention provides at least one compound of formula I<br><br>
and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters thereof wherein Xi X2, X3 R, Y1, and Y2 are as herein described.<br>
The present invention provides chiral cis-imidazolines which are small molecule inhibitors of the MDM2-p53 interaction. In cell-free and cell-based assays, compounds of the present invention are shown to inhibit the interaction of MDM2 protein with a p53-like peptide with a potency that is approximately 100 fold greater than a p53-derived peptide. In cell-based assays, these compounds demonstrate mechanistic activity. Incubation of cancer cells with wild-type p53 leads to accumulation of p53 protein, induction of p53-regulated p21 gene, and cell cycle arrest in Gl and G2 phase,   resulting in potent antiproliferative activity against wild-type p53 cells in vitro. In contrast, these activities were not observed in cancer cells with mutant p53 at comparable compound concentrations. Therefore, the activity of MDM2 antagonists is likely linked to its mechanism of action. These compounds can be potent and selective anticancer agents.<br><br>

Information concerning esters and the use of esters for the delivery of pharmaceutical compounds is available in Design of Prodrugs. Bundgaard H ed. (Elsevier, 1985). See also, H. Ansel et. al., Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems (6th Ed. 1995) at pp. 108-109; Krogsgaard-Larsen, et. al., Textbook of Drug Design and Development (2d Ed. 1996) at pp. 152-191.<br><br>
"Pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to conventional acid-addition salts or base-addition salts that retain the biological effectiveness and properties of the compounds of the present invention and are formed from suitable non-toxic organic or inorganic acids or organic or inorganic bases. Sample acid-addition salts include those derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, sulfuric acid, sulfamic acid, phosphoric acid and nitric acid, and those derived from organic acids such as p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid, methanesulfonic acid, oxalic acid, succinic acid, citric acid, malic acid, lactic acid, fiimaric acid, and the like. Sample base-addition salts include those derived from ammonium, potassium, sodium and, quaternary ammonium hydroxides, such as for example, tetramethylammonium hydroxide. Chemical modification of a pharmaceutical compound (i.e. drug) into a salt is a technique well known to pharmaceutical chemists to obtain improved physical and chemical stability, hygroscopicity, flowability and solubility of compounds. See, e.g., H. Ansel et. al., Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems (6th Ed. 1995) at pp. 196 and 1456-1457.<br>
"Pharmaceutically acceptable," such as pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, excipient, etc., means pharmacologically acceptable and substantially non-toxic to the subject to which the particular compound is administered.<br>
"Substituted" means that the substitution can occur at one or more positions and, unless otherwise indicated, that the substituents at each substitution site are independently selected from the specified options.<br>
"Therapeutically effective amount" means an amount of at least one designated compound, that significantly inhibits proliferation and/or prevents differentiation of a human tumor cell, including human tumor cell lines.<br>
Compounds of the present invention as exemplified advantageously show IC50s from about 0.005 uM to about 20 uM.<br><br>
The compounds of the present invention are useful in the treatment or control of cell proliferative disorders, in particular oncological disorders. These compounds and formulations containing said compounds may be useful in the treatment or control of solid tumors, such as, for example, breast, colon, lung and prostate tumors.<br>
A therapeutically effective amount of a compound in accordance with this invention means an amount of compound that is effective to prevent, alleviate or ameliorate symptoms of disease or prolong the survival of the subject being treated. Determination of a therapeutically effective amount is within the skill in the art.<br>
The therapeutically effective amount or dosage of a compound according to this invention can vary within wide limits and may be determined in a manner known in the art. Such dosage will be adjusted to the individual requirements in each particular case including the specific compound(s) being administered, the route of administration, the condition being treated, as well as the patient being treated. In general, in the case of oral or parenteral administration to adult humans weighing approximately 70 Kg, a daily dosage of about 10 mg to about 10,000 mg, preferably from about 200 mg to about 1,000 mg, should be appropriate, although the upper limit may be exceeded when indicated. The daily dosage can be administered as a single dose or in divided doses, or for parenteral administration, it may be given as continuous infusion.<br>
The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising at least one compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof, and a pharmaceutical^ acceptable carrier or excipient.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be prepared according to the following scheme 1.<br><br><br>
The synthesis commences with the coupling reaction of the benzoic acid ester 2 (2 = methyl, ethyl, etc.) with a diamine of formula 1, for example meso-l,2-bis-(4-chlorophenyl)-ethane-l,2-diamine (prepared according to the procedure described by Jennerwein, M. et al. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol 1988, 114, 347-58; Vogtle, F.; Goldschmitt, E. Chem. Ber. 1976, 709,1-40) using trimethylaluminum as a catalyst in a solvent such as toluene with heating at reflux (Moormann, A. E. et alj. Med. Chem, 1990, 33 , 614-626). Benzoic acid esters 2 are prepared using the procedures known in the art. Treatment of the cis-imidazoline 3 with phosgene in the presence of a base such as triethylamine gives the racemic carbamoyl chloride 4. Coupling of the racemic carbamoyl chloride 4 with appropriate R amine groups provides the compounds of the formula I as racemic mixtures. Many R amine groups are commercially available. If it is<br><br>
desired, R amine groups can be prepared using synthetic methods known in the art. Suitable processes for making these R amine groups are provided in the examples.<br>
If it is desired to prepare the optically active compounds of formula I, the enantiomers of the carbamoyl chloride rac-4 can be separated using chiral chromatography. The chiral stationary phase RJR-Whelk-Ol, available through Regis Technologies, can be used. Coupling of the desired enantiomer 5 A with appropriate R amine groups provides the compounds of the formula I.<br>
Also the optically active compounds of formula 1 can be obtained by chiral separation of the racemic mixtures of I. The chiral stationary phase Diacel ChiralPak OD or AD can be used.<br>
The absolute stereochemistry of the preferred enantiomer of I is determined based on the crystal structure of its complex with the human MDM2 (Vassilev ei ah Science, 2004, 303, 844-848.<br>
The following examples and references are provided to aid the understanding of the present invention, the true scope of which is set forth in the appended claims.<br><br>

A solution of 3-tert-butylphenol (100 g, 665.7 mmol, TCI) and potassium hydroxide (37.35 g,<br>
665.7	mmol) in 260 mL of water was added to a vigorously stirred solution of iodine (202.8 g,<br>
798.7	mmol) and potassium hydroxide (89.95 g, 1598 mmol) in 1100 mL of water. The combined solution immediately turned white. It was stirred for 5 min. A small sample of the reaction mixture was removed, acidified and extracted with ethyl acetate. Thin layer chromatography (silica gel, 30% methylene chloride in hexane) showed the product (lower Rf)<br><br>

The ability of the compounds to inhibit the interaction between p53 and MDM2 proteins was measured by an HTRF (homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence) assay in which recombinant GST-tagged MDM2 binds to a peptide that resembles the MDM2-interacting region of p53 (Lane et al.). Binding of GST-MDM2 protein and p53-peptide (biotinylated on its N-terminal end) is registered by the FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) between Europium (Eu)-labeled anti-GST antibody and streptavidin-conjugated Allophycocyanin (APC).<br><br>
Test is performed in black flat-bottom 384-well plates (Costar) in a total volume of 40 uL containing:90 nM biotinylate peptide, 160 ng/ml GST-MDM2, 20 nM streptavidin-APC (PerkinElmerWallac), 2 nM Eu-labeled anti-GST-antibody (PerkinElmerWallac), 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 20 mM Tris-borate saline (TBS) buffer as follows: Add 10 uL of GST-MDM2 (640 ng/ml working solution) in reaction buffer to each well. Add 10 uL diluted compounds (1:5 dilution in reaction buffer) to each well, mix by shaking. Add 20 uL biotinylated p53 peptide (180 nM working solution) in reaction buffer to each well and mix on shaker. Incubate at 37°C for 1 h. Add 20 uL streptavidin-APC and Eu-anti-GST antibody mixture (6 nM Eu-anti-GST and 60 nM streptavidin-APC working solution) in TBS buffer with 0.2% BSA, shake at room temperature for 30 minutes and read using a TRF-capable plate reader at 665 and 615 nm (Victor 5, Perkin ElmerWallac). If not specified, the reagents were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co.<br>
