				<td>Process for the preparation of a 2-pyridylcthvIcarboxamide derivative<br><br>
The present invention relates to a novel process for the preparation of N-[2-(2-pyridinyl)ethyl]carboxamide derivative which is useful as pesticide compound, starting with a halogenobenzoyl derivative to produce a N-acetoxymethylcarboxamide derivative and then coupling it with a 2-pyridyl acetate derivative.<br>
Patent application WO 2004/016088 discloses the preparation of N-[2-(2-pyridinyl)ethyl]benzamide derivatives starting from 2-halogenopyridine derivatives to produce 2-ethylaminopyridine derivatives and then coupling these 2-ethylaminopyridine derivatives with a halogenobenzoyl derivative.<br>
The process disclosed in this patent application presents the drawback in that one of the step of this process consists in the reduction of a 2-methylcyanopyridine derivative to produce a 2-ehtylaminopyridine derivative. Such a step is difficult and its yield is not acceptable at an industrial scale.<br>
We have now found an alternative method to prepare N-[2-(2-pyridinyl)ethyl]carboxamide derivative which overcomes these problems and which is applicable to industrial scale operation.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a N-[2-(2-pyridinyl)ethyl]carboxamide derivative of general formula (I) or a salt thereof<br>
