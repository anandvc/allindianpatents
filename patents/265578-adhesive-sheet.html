				<td>Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an adhesive sheet and specifically an adhesive sheet having an excellent adhesive property, which can be attached to a plasticized vinyl chloride resin article, more particularly a blood bag made of a plasticized vinyl chloride resin.<br>
Background Art<br>
As a blood bag in which blood is put, blood bags made of a plasticized vinyl chloride resin have widely been used to date. The blood bag is used with a label described about information of blood being attached thereon.<br>
After the attached label is subjected to an<br>
autoclave treatment or a steam sterilization at 120°C for about 30 minutes, there is an instance where plasticizers contained in a plasticized vinyl chloride resin move into an adhesive layer to lower the adhesive property of the label, and lifting or peeling of the label take place. When the label is peeled off from the blood bag, information of blood is lost, causing a serious problem. Further, even in this case, if the label is merely peeled off, the blood bag that the label was peeled off may be<br>
scrapped, but in the case where a plurality of labels are peeled off without someone's knowledge for some reason, and the labels are wrongly attached to one of the other blood bags again, a blood bag with wrong blood information is used, resulting in a further fatal problem.<br>
Moreover, as a label for a blood bag, there is used a label on which a trade name, volume, ingredient representation, and manufacture etc. are printed. In this field, a bar-code management system is established, the label that bar-code are printed is required. As a label for a blood bag, conventionally a label of paper as a substrate has been mainly used. However, when such label is in application to a blood bag, there have been problems that in treatment by a centrifugal separator to separate a normal blood cell component, a blood plasma component and the other component, due to lack of strength of the label substrate, the label cannot endure a centrifugal force and is broken, cracked, or through friction of the printed surface against the wall surface or the blood bag surface, information such as bar-code becomes too unclear to read by a bar-code reader. Therefore, there has increasingly desired a plastic film substrate being less influenced by moisture than a paper substrate, and resistant to rubbing and strong/tough. However, although a plastic film substrate has the superiority described above, it has defect that lifting or peeling occurs more easily than a paper substrate in<br>
an autoclave treatment or a steam sterilization treatment and a centrifugal separation treatment. Further, when a heat sealing label is based on a plastic film substrate of liner-less roll type, it has a defect that blocking occurs more easily than a paper substrate.<br>
To solve these problems, there is proposed a label for a blood bag based on a substrate film which is a microporous plastic film with a matrix structure surrounding pores connecting each other so that gas can flow in said blood bag and flow out through a region labeled (see Japanese Patent No. 3404573). Lifting and peeling in an autoclave treatment can be suppressed, however, there has been a problem that it is difficult to obtain the label with excellent blocking resistance.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide, an adhesive sheet which has superior adhesive property when the adhesive sheet is attached to a plasticized vinyl chloride resin article, does not decrease strength even after an autoclave treatment or a storage at a low temperature, does not cause lifting or peeling and has excellent blocking resistance.<br>
The present inventors have perfected the present invention by discovering, as a result of a diligent study carried out to solve the above-described problems, that<br>
the above-described problems can be solved by forming a heat-sensitive adhesive layer composed of a resin comprising a crystalline polyester resin as a main<br>
component, on a backside surface of the film substrate.<br>
Thus, the present invention provides an adhesive sheet for attaching to a plasticized vinyl chloride resin article, which comprises a film substrate and a heat-sensitive adhesive layer formed on a backside surface of the film substrate, wherein the heat-sensitive adhesive layer is composed of a resin comprising a crystalline polyester resin as a main component.<br>
The present invention provides the adhesive sheet as described above, wherein a content ratio of the crystalline polyester resin comprised in the resin composing the heat-sensitive adhesive layer is 50 to 100 percent by mass.<br>
The present invention provides the adhesive sheet as described above, wherein the resin composing the heat-sensitive adhesive layer is composed of 50 to 100 percent by mass of the crystalline polyester resin and 50 to 0 percent by mass of an amorphous polyester resin.<br>
Additionally, the present invention provides the adhesive sheet as described above, wherein a melting<br>
point of the crystalline polyester resin is 50 to 200 °C.<br>
Also, the present invention provides the adhesive sheet as described above, wherein a glass transition<br>
temperature of the amorphous polyester resin is 10 to 90 °C.<br>
Further, the present invention provides the adhesive sheet as described above, wherein the adhesive sheet is an adhesive sheet for attaching to a plasticized vinyl chloride resin article having a center-line surface<br>
roughness Ra of 1.0 µm or higher.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention provides the adhesive sheet as described above, wherein the plasticized vinyl chloride resin article is an blood bag made of a plasticized vinyl chloride resin.<br>
Preferred Embodiments for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The film substrate in the present invention includes films or sheets of plastics of polyolefin resins such as polyethylene resin and polypropylene; polyester resins such as polybutylene terephthalate resin and polyethylene terephthalate resin; acetate resins; ABS resins; polystyrene resins; vinyl chloride resins and the like. Among them, films or sheets of vinyl chloride resins and polyester resins are preferable.<br>
The film substrate may be formed in either a single layer or multiple layers having two or more layers. The film substrate can be not oriented, or can be oriented into uniaxial direction or biaxial direction such as longitudinal direction or cross direction. The thickness of the film substrate is not limited, but the thickness<br>
may usually be 10 to 250µm, and is preferably 25 to 200 µm.<br>
The flow direction breaking strength of the film substrate is preferably 10 N/15mm to 220 N/15mm and the cross direction breaking strength of the film substrate is preferably 10 N/15mm to 220 N/15mm. By controlling the breaking strength of the film substrate in the above range, the breaking of the film substrate becomes more difficult. Further the breaking strength of the film substrate becomes smaller than the adhesive strength of the heat-sensitive adhesive layer to the plasticized vinyl chloride resin article, therefore, if the adhesive sheet is forced to be peeled off from the plasticized vinyl chloride resin article against the adhesive strength, the film substrate is broken before the film substrate is peeled off from the plasticized vinyl chloride resin article. Accordingly, it becomes difficult to replace the adhesive sheet from the plasticized vinyl chloride resin article for attaching to the other plasticized vinyl chloride resin article intentionally. The breaking strength was measured pursuant to JIS K7127.<br>
The film substrate can be colored or colorless transparent. A printing, a character printing or the like can be provided on the surface or the backside surface of the film substrate. Therefore, a heat-sensitive recording layer, a layer for receiving printing image which can provide a heat transfer printing, an inkjet printing, a<br>
laser printing or the like, a layer for improving printability, an layer for adhering ink easily or the like can be formed on the surface or the backside surface of the film substrate.<br>
Also, in order to improve the adhesion strength (keying strength) of the film substrate to the heat-sensitive adhesive layer, a primer treatment, a corona discharge treatment, or the like can be provided on the backside surface of the film substrate composing the heat-sensitive adhesive layer.<br>
In the present invention, the heat-sensitive adhesive layer is composed of a resin comprising a crystalline polyester resin as a main component.<br>
The crystalline polyester resin has a heat of melting crystal of 5 to 50 µg in measuring by a differential scanning calorimeter. When the heat of melting crystal is low, the crystalline polyester resin becomes nearly amorphous, the resin strength becomes lower, the adhesive strength decreases, and also, the blocking resistance is inferior. When the heat of melting crystal is high, the crystallization rate becomes faster, the open time becomes shorter, and the crystal shrinking becomes larger, so that the adhesive strength is decreased. The heat of melting crystal is preferably 10 to 45 µg, and more preferably 15 to 40 µg.<br>
The crystalline polyester resin has a melting point of preferably 50 to 200 °C, and more preferably 70 to<br>
150 °C. The crystalline polyester resin has a glass transition temperature of preferably -30 to 70 °C, and more preferably -20 to 50 °C.<br>
The content ratio of the crystalline polyester resin comprised in the resin composing the heat-sensitive adhesive layer is preferably 50 to 100 percent by mass, more preferably 60 to 100 percent by mass, furthermore preferably 70 to 100 percent by mass and most preferably 80 to 100 percent by mass.<br>
The resin composing the heat-sensitive adhesive layer can contain the other resins other than the crystalline polyester resin. The other resins include various resins, but preferably amorphous polyester resins.<br>
The amorphous polyester resin has excellent wettability and excellent followability to the surface of the article when the adhesive sheet is attached to the plasticized vinyl chloride resin article. In particular, when the surface of the article is rough, the amorphous polyester resin has excellent wettability and excellent followability of the adhesive sheet to the surface of the article.<br>
The amorphous polyester resin has a glass transition temperature of preferably 10 to 90 °C, and more preferably 30 to 80 °C. When the glass transition temperature of the amorphous polyester resin is less than<br>
10 °C, the blocking resistance trends to decrease easily. When the glass transition temperature of the amorphous<br>
polyester resin is more than 90 °C, it takes long time to melt, and therefore, there is an instance that the heat sealing property becomes worse.<br>
The content ratio of the amorphous polyester resin comprised in the resin composing the heat-sensitive adhesive layer is preferably 50 to 0 percent by mass, more preferably 40 to 0 percent by mass, furthermore preferably 30 to 0 percent by mass and most preferably 20 to 0 percent by mass. When the amorphous polyester resin is comprised in the resin composing the heat-sensitive adhesive layer, the lower limit value of the content is preferably not less than 0.1 percent by mass, more preferably not less than 0.5 percent by mass, and most preferably not less than 1 percent by mass.<br>
