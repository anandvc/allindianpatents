FOLDING CLOSURE FOR CARGO CONTAINERS<br>
Field of the Art<br>
The invention is related to closure covers which are used in truck and trailer cargo containers, proposing a folding closure with structural features improving functionality. State of the Art<br>
Truck and trailer cargo containers may be exposed or closed with covers, using permanent covers on occasion, but in other cases it is necessary to be able to remove the closure for loading and unloading operations, or for having direct access to the cargo located within, to which end moving or removable covers are used.<br>
In this sense moving covers are known that allow their movement to leave the corresponding side of the cargo container open, for example by means of a solution of tarps arranged in a guided assembly on rails, with the possibility of movement thereof for a folding in an end position of the application assembly.<br>
Due to the length of the assembly rails and the weight of the incorporated tarps, as well as due to temperature variations, said assembly rails of the tarps experience buckling, making the sliding movement of the tarps difficult, even being able to cause said movement of the tarps to lock. Object of the Invention<br>
According to the present invention a folding closure is proposed, having a sliding tarp with assembly features that effectively solve the problems of tarp movement difficulty, such that an advantageous functionality with respect to conventional assemblies is obtained.<br>
This closure object of the invention consists of two parallel longitudinal rails, a bottom one and a top one, which<br>
 2A<br>
are fixed to the frame of the application cargo container, running carriages arranged fastened on the tarp and end carriages which are arranged coupled with respect to terminal profiles incorporated on the ends of the tarp being incorporated on each one of said rails.<br>
The rails of the assembly are made up of profiles defining V-shaped running tracks both in the bottom portion and the top portion, in which tracks the carriages of the tarp and the carriages of the end closure profiles are coupled by means of wheels, such that said wheels of the carriages establish two point supports on the V-shaped paths which are determined by the tracks.<br>
A rolling assembly with very little friction is thus obtained, since the wheels rest on the rolling paths only at two contact points, while the arrangement of this assembly defines a permanent contact of the wheels on the running paths in any position, favoring the jam-free sliding although the carriages experience lateral or longitudinal inclinations.<br>
The terminal profiles which are incorporated at the ends of the tarp define a longitudinal groove in which a closure mechanism is arranged fitted, such that said mechanism may be slid in order to place it at the desired height, being fixed in the corresponding position by means of screws.<br>
Said terminal profiles of the tarp define at one of its edges a housing in which the coupling of the tarp by means of insertion with a capturing conduit is established, whereas a resilient sealing is arranged on the other edge to form the support of the closure.<br>
The end carriages of the sliding assembly are arranged on the top and bottom of said terminal profiles of the tarp, the bottom carriage being fixed by means of screws or a similar solution on the corresponding profile, whereas the top carriage is arranged freely fitted, forming a floating coupling with respect to the profile, which allows compensating the longitudinal buckling of the rails,<br>
 3<br>
maintaining the sliding freedom in the movements.<br>
The profiles making up the assembly rails have on the outer lateral side a longitudinal groove in which a protective device against blows is arranged on the bottom rail of the assembly; said profiles of the rails further defining on the same outer lateral side a cavity defining a housing, in which a cover skirt is incorporated on the top rail to prevent rainwater from entering through the assembly into the application cargo container.<br>
Given that the tarp of the assembly is susceptible to longitudinal expansion by use and as a result of temperature changes, the incorporation of an accessory supplement is provided for at the fixed latching part of the closure mechanisms of the ends, by means of which an latching is defined that allows compensating the expansion so that the tarp remains taut when the closure is formed.<br>
With the foregoing, the assembly of the proposed closure results from certainly advantageous features for its function, acquiring its own life and a preferred character with respect to the conventional assemblies of the same application. Description of the Figures<br>

The object of the invention relates to a folding closure for truck or trailer cargo containers with assembly features making it particularly advantageous in its operation.<br>
The proposed closure consists of two longitudinal rails (1) which are arranged fixed on the chassis (2) of the application cargo container, one in a top position and the other one in a bottom position, with respect to which rails (1) a tarp (3) susceptible to folding is arranged in a sliding assembly.<br>
The assembly of the tarp (3) on the rails (1) is established by means of running carriages (4 and 5) , which are arranged fixed on the top part and the bottom part of the tarp (3), respectively, being coupled on the rails (1) by means of wheels (6) which move inside them.<br>
Further incorporated at the ends of the tarp (3) are terminal profiles (7) on which respective top carriages (8) and respective bottom carriages (9) are arranged in turn, which are also coupled in a running assembly on the rails (1) by means of corresponding wheels (6).<br>
As can be seen in Figures 20 and 21, the rails (1) are made up of respective identical profiles, which define inside V-shaped tracks (10) on which the wheels (6) of the carriages form two point supports, causing very little friction, favoring the running.<br>
 6<br>
Incorporated at the ends of the tarp (3) are respective terminal profiles (7) which define a longitudinal groove (11) in which a closure mechanism (12) is arranged fitted, such that said mechanism (12) can be slid in order to place it at the appropriate height, being fixed in the chosen position by means of screws (13), as observed in Figures 15 to 17.<br>
Said terminal profiles (7) define on one edge a housing (14) in which the end of the tarp (3) is inserted with a bushing (15) forming a retaining hold, as seen in Figures 3, 4, and 5; while on the other edge said profiles (7) have a groove (16) in which an elastic seal (17) intended for forming the closure support is inserted.<br>
Each one of the carriages (4, 5, 8, and 9) has two pairs of wheels (6) facing each other two-wise, by means of which respective supports are formed on the tracks (10) of the rails (1), such that in a normal position, such as that of Figure 20, all the wheels (6) rest on the tracks (10) of the bottom part, forming an easy-to-run arrangement whereas when a lateral inclination of the corresponding carriage occurs, the wheels (6) of one side rest on the respective bottom track (10) , and the wheels (6) of the other side rest on the top track (10) of that side, as depicted in Figure 21, a good running arrangement thus being maintained without the risk of locking.<br>
Likewise, in the event of a longitudinal inclination of any of the carriages, their wheels (6) of one end are supported on the bottom tracks (10) , whereas the wheels (6) of the other end are supported on the top tracks (10), a good running arrangement likewise being maintained, without the occurrence of locking.<br>
With said arrangement, the tarp (3) is directly arranged in a running assembly on the rails (1) , by means of the carriages (4 and 5) , and in an indirect running assembly through the terminal profiles (7) by means of the carriages (8 and 9) ; in the assembly of which the carriages (4 and 5) are<br>
 7<br>
arranged fixedly joined to the tarp (3) by means of screws (18) or similar means, rigid plates (19) being incorporated in the corresponding areas on the tarp (3) to reinforce these unions .<br>
With respect to the terminal profiles (7) , the corresponding bottom carriages (9) are arranged fixed by means of screws (20) or similar means, as shown in Figure 12; while the top carriages (8) are arranged freely fitted by means of a tab (21) in the groove (11) of the corresponding profile (7), as depicted by Figure 14, thus defining a floating coupling that allows compensating for the height differences between the rails (1) due to longitudinal warping thereof, whereupon a good arrangement of the sliding of the tarp (3) on said rails (1) is maintained, preventing jams.<br>
The closure mechanisms (12) which are incorporated in the terminal profiles (7) form a retaining latching on the fixed chassis (2) of the application cargo container, such that a pull establishing the tautness of the tarp (3) is defined by means of the latching of the closure mechanisms (12) of the two ends.<br>
However, given that due to the temperature variations and the passing of time the tarp (3) is susceptible to a longitudinal stretching that may cause that tautening is not achieved with the closure latches on the ends, to compensate for the elongation the incorporation of complementary accessories (26) in the latching areas of the closure mechanisms (12) is provided for, whereupon said mechanisms (12) force a greater stretching of the tarp (3), achieving its tautening.<br>
The top and bottom rails (1) are made up of identical profiles, which on the outer lateral side determine a longitudinal groove (22) and a cavity (23), such that in application assemblies, the bottom rail (1) may be supplemented with an buffer protective device (24) that is fitted in the groove (22) of the corresponding profile, as<br>
 8<br>
depicted by Figure 23, while the top rail (1) can be supplemented with a skirt (25) that is fitted in the cavity (23) of the respective profile, as depicted by figure 22, to determine a cover that prevents rainwater from entering through the closure assembly into the application cargo container.<br>
