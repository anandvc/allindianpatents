				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of dehydrated bamboo shoots with improved reconstitution.<br>
Bamboo shoot is being used as food product in different ways. Bamboo Shoots are traded as fresh frozen product, canned, pickled and preserved in acetic acid. Bamboo Shoot forms an important ingredient in Chinese cooking. It is used in soups, meat preparation, preparation of drinks and jam, and as an ingredient in majority of special dishes. Bamboo Shoots are used in Japan, China, Hong-Kong, Taiwan, Thailand, Korea and some parts of India.<br>
In India, Bamboo Shoot is used as a part of curry or as pickle and in North Eastern region for preparation of Meso type of products. In the international market, color, size, freshness, appearance are the different qualities the consumers look for in frozen and fresh bamboo shoot. They are usually packed in 100, 200, 300 and 500 gram sizes. Institution purchases 500 and 1000 grams containers.<br>
In the present invention the Tender bamboo shoots are washed and the outer sheath is removed. The pieces are cut as rings or segments. The prepared material is put in boiling water for 60 minutes with twice change of water in between. This facilitates removal of the poisonous principle, the hydro cyanic acid- HCN. After draining, the bamboo shoots are subjected to pretreatments to improve its drying and rehydration characteristics. The product when reconstituted in cold water for a fixed period of time reconstitutes well to give a highly acceptable product.<br>
There is no prior report as such on the dehydrated bamboo shoots with high reconstitution properties but few relevant prior reports are available with respect to dehydration of bamboo shoots.<br>
Reference may be made to Sato-M(1987) Method and equipment for producing dried food, European-Patent (EP0223887A1) Wherein, a method for producing 'refreshable dry food' which on rehydration closely resembles fresh<br>
product is reported. In this method, the sample is placed in vacuum chamber, the pressure is reduced to 133-667Pa and the temp, from 0-10 degree C, and the food is irradiated with IR energy. Irradiation is terminated when the temp, reaches 5-40°C and the food has dried without change in texture.<br>
The main draw back of this invention is that the product is obtained by vacuum drying where vacuum is applied through out the process and also requires the use of IR energy for drying.<br>
Reference may be made to Tanzawa-M (1977) Bamboo shoot product. Japanese-Patent (5215658). Wherein, the process for softening dried bamboo shoots involves boiling, followed by impregnation with a solution containing alcohol, salts and vinegar.<br>
The Main drawback of this invention is that the dried bamboo shoot first cooked in boiling water which is then soaked in solution containing alcohol, salts and vinegar. This may give an acidic taste to the product.<br>
Reference may be made to Madamba-P-S (2003). Physical changes in Bamboo (Bambusa phyllostachys) shoot during hot air drying: shrinkage, density and porosity. Drying Technology. 21(3):555-568. Wherein, the physical changes (shrinkage, density and porosity) of bamboo shoots were investigated.<br>
The main draw back of this process is it does not relate to rehydration properties of dried shoots.<br>
Reference may be made to Po-Yuan-Chiang (1998) Changes in enzyme activities, chemical components and texture of dried ma-bamboo shoots (Dendrocalamus latiflorus) during fermentation. Food-Science, Taiwan. 25(5); 537-546. Wherein, changes in enzyme activities, chemical components and texture of dried ma-bamboo shoots during fermentation are described.<br>
The main drawback in this process is that it pertains to study of changes in enzyme activities, chemical components and texture of dried ma-bamboo shoots during fermentation and does not refer to improvement in rehydration of dried bamboo shoots.<br>
Reference may be made to Rhee-C: Maeng-YS (1983) Korean-Journal-of-Food-Science-and-Technology; 15(4)315-320. Wherein, water vapor sorption isotherms for numerous food products including bamboo were determined.<br>
The main draw back of this study is that it refers to storage stability and variation of entropy with moisture content of dehydrated foods. It does not refer to rehydration property of dried bamboo shoots.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a process for dehydrated bamboo shoots with improved reconstitution.<br>
In another objective of the present invention is to provide as product for the preparation of curry, chutney, soups, powder etc.<br>
Yet, in another objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of dehydrated bamboo shoots which on reconstitution closely resembles the fresh.<br>
An embodiment of the present invention provides a process for the preparation of dehydrated bamboo shoot with improved reconstitution, which comprises the steps of:<br>
a)	selecting fresh, firm and un-infested bamboo shoots;<br>
b)	trimming bamboo shoots followed by peeling in order to obtain tender central core;<br>
c)	washing the tender central core obtained in step (b) using tap water at the temperature in the range of 27-30 deg. C;<br>
d)	cutting the shoot vertically into quarters followed by slicing using slicer machine in order to obtain bamboo pieces having thickness in the range of 2-6 millimeter;<br>
e)	adding bamboo pieces obtained in step (d) in to boiling water at the ratio of about 1:2 (w/v) followed by boiling for a period of about 60 minutes with intermittent changing of water twice in order to obtain hydrogen cyanide-free bamboo pieces.<br>
f)	Soaking hydrogen cyanide-free bamboo pieces obtained in step (e) in a solution containing sodium chloride at the concentration in the range of 1-2 percent, gelatinized starch at the concentration in the range of 0.5-2.0 percent and potassium meta bisulphite at the concentration in the range of 1000-2000 ppm at the temperature in the range of 25-28 deg. C for a period in the range of 20-30 minutes followed by removal of solution in order to obtain treated bamboo pieces; AND<br>
g)	spreading the treated bamboo pieces obtained in step (f) on aluminium trays followed by drying at a temperature in the range of 50-70 deg. C using a mechanical drier in order to obtain dehydrated bamboo shoot pieces having 4-7 percent moisture followed by packing.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the storage of dehydrated bamboo shoots used is carried out at the temperature in the range of 25-28 deg. C using moralized polyester/polyethylene pouches at the rate of 25 grams per unit pack so as to store the product without much changes in color and without microbial damage even after 6 months of storage.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the process as claimed in claims 1-2, wherein the product obtained is useful for instant curry preparation by putting into boiling water in the ratio about 1:2 followed by simmering for a period in the range of 10-30 minutes.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the product obtained is used for preparation of curry by reconstituting in water at the ratio of about 1:2 (w/v) followed by incubation at a temperature in the range of 25-28 deg C for a period of about 8-12 hours.<br>
The novelty of the present invention is that the dried bamboo shoots prepared by this method is unfermented, has good color, and upon reconstitution is very close to fresh bamboo shoots with respect to color and texture.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of dehydrated bamboo shoots with improved reconstitution, which comprises of: 1. (i) Trimming of fresh, firm, un infested shoots, followed by peeling to obtain the tender central core, washing with tap water (27°-30°C), cutting the shoot vertically into quarters. These quarters are then put in the slicer to make 2-6mm thick slices, ii) About twice the amount of water is brought to boil and the pieces are then added. The slices are boiled in water for 50-70 minutes during which the water is changed twice. The slices are ensured to be free of HCN. iii) Soaking of slices in solution containing 1-2% sodium chloride and 0.5%- 2.0 % gelatinized starch and 1000-2000ppm Potassium meta bisulphite at 25-28°C for 20-30 minutes followed by draining, iv) Spreading the treated slices on aluminium trays and dried at a temperature of 50-70°C in a mechanical drier to get a finished product of 4-7% moisture followed by packing in metallised polyester/polyethylene, v) The dried slices are reconstituted by soaking in water at 25-28°C for 8-12 hours followed by cooking in boiling water for 10-30 minutes.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the fresh, firm, un infested bamboo shoots are trimmed peeled and washed. They are cut longitudinally into quarters and these quarters are cut into 4mm thick slices.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the slices are boiled for 60 minutes during which the water is changed twice.<br>
Yet, in another embodiment of the present invention, the drained slices are soaked in solution containing 1-2% sodium chloride and 1.0 % starch, after gelatinizing, and 1500-2000ppm Potassium meta bisulphite (solution : slices, 2:1) at 25-28°C for 20-30 minutes followed by draining.<br>
Yet, in another embodiment of the present invention, the slices are spread on aluminium trays and dried at a temperature of 50-70°C in a mechanical drier to get a finished product of 4-7% moisture followed by packing.<br>
Still yet, in another embodiment of the present invention the dried slices are reconstituted by soaking in water at 25-28°C for 8-12 hours followed by cooking in boiling water for 20 minutes.<br>
The process for the present invention involves the following steps: (i) Trimming of fresh, firm, un infested shoots, followed by peeling to obtain the tender central core, washing with tap water (27°-30°C), cutting the shoot vertically into quarters. These quarters are then put into a mechanical slicer to make 4mm thick slices, ii) About twice the amount of water is brought to boil and the pieces are then added. The slices are boiled for 60 minutes during which the water is changed twice. The shoots are ensured to be free of HCN by means of a qualitative test (AOAC, 2000). iii) Soaking of slices in solution containing 1-2% sodium chloride and 1.0 % gelatinized starch and 1500-2000ppm Potassium meta bisulphite at 25-28°C for 20-30 minutes followed by draining, iv) Spreading the treated slices on aluminium trays and dried at a temperature of 50-70°C in a mechanical drier to get a finished product of 4-7% moisture followed by packing in metallised polyester/polyethylene pouches, v) The dried slices are reconstituted by cooking for fixed period of time, vi) The dried slices are reconstituted by soaking in water at 25-28°C for 8-12 hours followed by cooking in boiling water for 20 minutes.<br>
quarters and quarters were then mechanically sliced into 4mm thick slices (1.5kg). These slices were then boiled in twice the amount of water for 60 minutes with twice change of water in-between. The slices were drained and tested for HCN to ensure its absence. 400g of the above slices were then dipped in 0.8 I of solution (solution .pieces, 2:1) containing 1500ppm of Potassium meta bisulphite and 1% Sodium Chloride at 27°C-30°C for 30 minutes. The slices were then drained and spread on aluminum trays and dried in a Cabinet drier at 65°C to give a product with 5% moisture content. The product was then packed in metallised polyester/polyethylene laminate pouches. 2g of the dried sample was added to 250ml of boiling water and allowed to simmer for 15 minutes. The pieces were then drained for 10 minutes and then weighed(11.8g). The rehydration ratio was 1: 5.9 . 2g of the dried sample was allowed to soak in 250ml of cold water at 27°C-30°C for 10 hrs and the pieces were drained and weighed(19.0g), which when simmered in boiling water for 20 minutes increased to 24g after draining, the rehydration ratio was 1:12.<br>
Example 4<br>
5.3 kg shoot after washing with tap water (27°C-30°C), were peeled and the mature outer sheath removed. The tender central core was cut vertically into quarters and mechanically sliced into 4mm thick slices (1.5kg). These slices were then boiled in twice the amount of water for 60 minutes with twice change of water in-between. The slices were drained and tested for HCN to ensure its absence. 800g of the above slices were then dipped in 1.6 I of solution (solution : pieces, 2:1) containing 1500ppm of Potassium meta bisulphite and 1% Sodium Chloride and 1% gelatitnised starch solution at 27°C-30°C for 30 minutes. The slices were then drained and spread on aluminum trays and dried in a Cabinet drier at 65°C to give a product with 5% moisture content. 2g of the dried sample was added to 250ml of boiling water and allowed to simmer for 15 minutes. The pieces were then drained for 10 minutes and then weighed (12.6g). The rehydration ratio was 1: 6.3. 2g of the dried sample was allowed to soak in 250ml of cold water at 27°C-30°C for 10 hrs and the pieces were drained<br>
and weighed (24.0g),   which when simmered   in boiling water for  20  minutes increased to 28g after draining, the rehydration ratio was 1:14.<br>
The main advantages:<br>
1.	The dehydrated bamboo shoots prepared by the present invention could be reconstituted to get product closer to fresh. The product resembled the fresh with respect to color, texture and flavor upon reconstitution.<br>
2.	The product has no fermented or acidic flavor hence has varied use like for preparation of curry, chutney, pickles, soups etc.<br>
3.	Storage of dehydrated bamboo shoots at 27-30°C resulted in a good product without much changes in color and microbial load even after 6 months of storage in metallised polyester/polyethylene pouches.<br>
4.	Dehydrated shoots prepared as above can also be powdered to get bamboo shoot powder for varied use.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention and should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention. Variations and changes may be made by one skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the invention. All parts and percentages are by weight, unless otherwise indicated.<br>

3.78 kg shoot after washing with tap water (27°C-30°C), was peeled and the mature outer sheath removed. The tender central core was cut vertically into quarters and the quarters were mechanically sliced into 4mm thick slices (1.125kg). These slices were then boiled in double the amount of water for 60 minutes with twice change of water in-between. The slices were drained and tested for HCN to ensure its absence. 300g of the above slices were then spread on aluminum trays and dried in a Cabinet drier at 65°C to give a product with 5% moisture content. 2g of the dried sample was added to 250ml of boiling water and allowed to simmer for 15 minutes. The pieces were then drained for 10 minutes and weighed(7g). The rehydration ratio was 1:3.5.<br>
Example 2<br>
The bamboo shoot slices of 4mm thick were prepared and were made free from HCN as described in example 1. 300g of the prepared slices were then dipped in 600ml of solution (solution : pieces, 2:1) containing 1500ppm of Potassium meta bisulphite at 27°C-30°C for 30 minutes. The pieces were then drained and spread on aluminum trays and dried in a Cabinet drier at 65°C to give a product with 5% moisture content. 2g of the dried sample was added to 250ml of boiling water and allowed to simmer for 15 minutes. The pieces were then drained for 10 minutes and weighed (8g). The rehydration ratio was 1: 4.<br>
