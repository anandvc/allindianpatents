PARTICULARLY	DESCRIBES	THE<br>
INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED. <br><br><br>
1<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention<br>
The  present  invention  relates  to  packet-based communication  technology,  and more  particularly  to recovery of a received signal at a receiver in a packet-based communication system.<br>
 Description of the Related Art<br>
IEEE 802.11 is a well know packet-based wireless communication standard using OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) modulation technique and is now adopted as the standard in wireless LANs (Wireless Local Area Network).<br>
The IEEE 802.11 specification defines requirements for a physical (PHY) layer and a medium access control (MAC) layer, which is one of the two sub-layers in a data link layer according to the OSI (Open System Interconnection) network model. Commonly-seen IEEE 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.llg are different PHY layer standards and they all follow the same MAC layer standard.<br>
Figure 1 shows a frame format in the PHY layer of the IEEE 802.11a standard. As shown, a packet frame is divided into three portions, a preamble portion 10, a header portion 12 and a data portion 14. The preamble portion 10, which is also referred to as a training sequence, consists of a short preamble field with 10 short symbols and a long preamble field with two long symbols. In a WLAN receiver, inherent problems, such as DC offset and AGC, must be solved. In a high speed communication, the transmitted and<br>
2<br><br>
corresponding received signals are often different from each other, and therefore, timing synchronization and frequency offset estimation must be performed. In addition, the transmission channel is unknown at the receiver and thus must be estimated. These are achieved based on the training sequence in the preamble field at the beginning of each frame format.<br>
The header portion 12 is used for carrying information<br>
about the coding rate and the length of the packet.<br>
The data portion 14 includes the PSDU field (i.e., packet data), the tail bits (six "0's") and the pad bits.<br>
Figure 2 shows a general frame format in the MAC layer of the IEEE 802.11 standard. When the packet data is decoded in the PHY layer and delivered to the MAC layer, it will be further identified whether or not the current packet is intended to be transmitted to this receiver. This is performed by examining whether or not the destination address (DA) in the field "Add 1" in Figure 2 matches an identity address of the receiver (for example, the MAC Address on a network interface card). In addition, a CRC checksum calculation is performed to verify the received packet data, that is, to detect transmission errors, by using the 32-bit CRC code contained in the field "FCS(Frame Check Sequence)".<br>
In the above exemplified IEEE 802 .11a specification, the preamble portion 10 is very short, with a very limited training duration of only 16 us for the receiver to retrieve all the required information in order to decode data correctly. This implies a complicated algorithm and a high cost to implement the estimation circuit.<br>
Therefore, there is a need for development of a receiver with a simpler algorithm for retrieving the required<br>
3<br><br>
information while allowing the estimated data, such as DC offset estimation, frequency offset estimation and channel estimation, in the receiver to well match with the transmitted data to improve the receiver performance.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a<br>
method and an apparatus of compensating for a signal receiving error at a receiver in a packet-based communication system, in which the estimated data, such as DC offset estimation and frequency offset estimation, obtained in a current packet can be re-used to reduce on-going signal receiving errors.<br>
The above object is achieved by providing a method and an apparatus of compensating for a signal receiving error at a receiver in a packet-based communication system, characterized by re-using an estimated data, such as frequency offset estimation and DC offset estimation, obtained in a current packet to compensate for a signal receiving error in the next packet if the receiver is an intended recipient of the current packet and the current packet is received correctly.<br>
These two conditions can be verified by destination address (DA) checking in the MAC layer and CRC-32 checking in the PHY layer, respectively.<br>
The estimated data continues to be improved through the packet receiving duration until it is latched at the end of the packet.<br>
If the transmission channel is time-invariant, the re-use scheme may also apply to channel estimation.<br>
By re-use of an estimated data for compensating for a signal receiving error, it is possible to further improve<br>
4<br><br>
the overall receiver performance and stability from packet to packet and the estimation algorithm is allowed to be simplified.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
In the present invention, a PHY layer estimation algorithm continues to refine an estimation data until the end of packet receiving duration and the accurate estimation data obtained in a current frame will be re-used in compensating for a signal receiving error in a next frame,<br>
instead of only using the limited training sequence in the beginning of each frame every time a new frame is received.<br>
5<br><br>
In deciding whether or not an estimation data obtained in the current packet is allowed to be re-used in the next packet, two conditions are considered. First, it should be determined whether or not the receiver is an intended recipient of the current packet. Second, it should be determined whether or not the current packet is received correctly. Only if the above conditions are both positive should the obtained estimation data be latched for re-use. In the case that the receiver is the intended recipient of the packet, dissatisfaction of the second condition is referred to as an "estimation failure". Successive estimation failures for a predetermined number of times N, e.g., ten times, stop the re-use of a latched estimation data and start a new estimation by using the training sequence in the beginning of a frame, as set forth in the description of the related art.<br>
Referring back to Figure 2, the first condition can be verified in the MAC layer, as described in the background art, by examining whether a destination address (DA) contained in the field "Add 1" of the current packet matches an identity address of the receiver. If the examination result is positive, a signal indicating that the receiver is an intended recipient of the current packet will be issued to the PHY layer.<br>
Although the second condition can also be verified in the MAC layer, it is likely that a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) performed by the MAC layer delays too much time for the PHY layer to obtain a prompt examination result. Consequently, in a preferred embodiment, the FCS is checked in the PHY layer in order to immediately detect transmission<br>
errors.<br>
As for which estimation data in the current packet is/are<br>
6<br><br>
allowed to be re-used in the next packet, in the IEEE 802 .11a standard, DC offset estimation and frequency offset estimation are selected in the preferred embodiment since the accuracy of DC offset estimation and frequency offset estimation significantly affect the decoding performance. Some other estimation information, such as channel estimation, also contributes to the receiver performance. However, re-use of channel estimation depends on the<br>
channel characteristics. In the case of time-invariant channel parameters, the re-use scheme of the present invention may apply.<br>
A preferred embodiment using the IEEE 802.11a standard will be described in detail for explaining be principles and spirits of the invention.<br>
Figure 3 shows a frame format in the PHY layer according to the present invention. As shown, a packet frame is divided into three portions, a preamble portion 30, a header portion 32 and a data portion 34, similar to the frame structure in Figure 1. The differences in the present invention include: (i) DC estimation seeding and FOE (frequency offset estimation) seeding operations in the training phase; (ii) receiving a MAC_HIT signal indicating whether or not the receiver is an intended recipient of the current packet; and (iii) performing a CRC-32 check in the PHY layer and generating a CRC_0K signal indicating whether or not the current packet is received correctly.<br>
Figures 4A and 4B are timing diagrams of two examples for explaining the conditions for applying the data latch operation according to the present invention. As shown in Figure 4A, three data packets 40a,  42a and 44a are<br>
successively received in the receiver.  The first and third packets 40a and 44a are detected to have a destination<br>
7<br><br>
address identical to the ID address of the receiver, and thus the MAC layer asserts the MAC_HIT signal to the PHY<br>
layer. All of the packets 40a to 44a are received correctly and thus the CRC_OK signal is asserted for all the three packets. Since the MAC_HIT and CRC_0K must be both asserted to apply the data latch operation, the frequency offset estimation and DC offset estimation in the packets 42a will not be latched and seeded in the training phase of the next packet 44a since one of the conditions is not satisfied, and the estimation information obtained in the previous packet 40a will still be reused in the next packet 44a. On the other hand, the frequency offset estimation and DC offset estimation in both the packets 40a and 44a will be latched for re-use.<br>
Similarly, in the example shown in Figure 4B, only the frequency offset estimation and DC offset estimation in the packet 42a will not be latched for re-use because of being<br>
incorrectly received.<br>
The flowchart in Figure 5 provides a better explanation for the method of processing a received signal in a PHY layer according to the present invention. In the flowchart, a variable number Estm_fail, which is initially set to zero, is used to denote a number of successive times of the estimation failures. As shown in Figure 5, after the receiving of a frame begins in step S500, if the number Estm_fail is small than a predetermined number N, which is a positive integer and can be decided depending on circuit design (S502), then the previously latched frequency offset estimation and DC offset estimation are seeded, i.e., re-used in the training phase of the current packet in step<br>
506; otherwise, the training sequence is used to evaluate new frequency offset and DC offset in step 504.  An extreme<br>
8<br><br>
example of the number N is 1, which means a single estimation failure will start a new estimation by using the training sequence.<br>
After DC offset cancellation, symbol timing establishment and frequency compensation, the received signals are then transformed to frequency domain for performing channel correction, which is further followed by de-mapping, de-interleaving, de-puncturing, decoding and descrambling. These are denoted as decoding procedure in step S508. The finally descrambled data are output to the MAC layer, which then issues a MAC_HIT signal, informing the PHY layer of the DA verification result (S510) . Further, a CRC checksum is performed by the PHY layer and a CRC_OK signal is generated accordingly (S512).<br>
During the decoding procedure, the estimation of frequency offset and DC offset continues to be refined and, if both the MAC_HIT signal and the CRC_OK signal are asserted (S514 and S515), the refined estimation data are latched at the end of the current packet and the number Estm_fail is reset to zero (S516). If an estimation failure is detected in step S515, then add one to the number Estm_fail in step S518.<br>
Figure 6 schematically illustrates a block diagram of the receiver according to the present invention. After received signals pass through an A/D converter 604, the DC offset is first removed in the DC cancellation circuit 606. Then, the signals are synchronized and a frequency offset correction is performed in the timing recovery and frequency offset compensation circuit 608. Both the DC cancellation circuit 606 and the timing recovery and frequency offset compensation circuit 608 are controlled, based on a re-use control signal issued by a re-use control<br>
9<br><br>
circuit 636,to either re-use the DC offset estimation and the frequency offset estimation respectively latched in the buffers 628 and 626 when the MAC_HIT signal and the CRC_OK signal are both asserted previously or use a newly generated DC offset estimation 632 and frequency offset estimation 630. If the number Estm_fail is small than a predetermined number N, 2-to-l multiplexers will be controlled to pass the DC offset estimation and frequency offset estimation latched in the buffers 628 and 626 to the circuits 606 and 608, respectively.<br>
After timing synchronization and frequency correction, the signals are then transformed to the frequency domain using FFT in a circuit block 610. Subsequently, channel estimation is performed and the channel is corrected in a channel correction circuit 612. At this node, the signal is used for aligning the frequency offset estimation 630 by employing a phase-locked loop (PLL) 634.<br>
Further, the channel corrected signal is de-mapped in a de-mapping circuit 614 and de-interleaved and de-punctured in a de-interleaving and de-puncturing circuit 616. De-interleaved bits output from circuit 616 are decoded by using Viterbi algorithm in a decoder 618 and finally descrambled in a scrambler 620.<br>
Although the preferred embodiment is disclosed employing the IEEE802 .11a standard, it should be considered as illustrative and not restrictive. For example, IEEE802.11g standard may be employed in other embodiments. The invention are not limited to be used within a wireless communication system, but may be used in wired communication system as long as the communication system is packet-based.<br>
By re-use of an estimated data for compensating for a<br>
10<br><br>
signal receiving error, it is possible to further improve the overall receiver performance and stability from packet to packet and the estimation algorithm is allowed to be simplified.<br>
While the present invention has been described with reference to the preferred embodiment thereof, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited thereby. Various modifications and changes could be conceived of by those skilled in the art without departuring from the scope of the present invention, which is indicated by the appended claims.<br>
