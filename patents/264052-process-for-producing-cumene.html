				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]      A process for producing cumene where the product cumene is separated using a dividing wall distillation column.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]       Cumene, or isopropylbenzene, is a valuable product mat is used mainly for the manufacture of phenol and acetone. Cumene has been produced by a catalytic process using a solid phosphoric acid that is made by impregnating kieselguhr with phosphoric acid. Now, zeolitic catalysts are used to produce higher quality cumene at a lower investment cost. [0003]       In a typical commercial process for the production of cumene, liquid benzene and liquid propylene are charged into an alkylation zone containing one or more reactors containing an alkylation catalyst. In order to minimize the production of polyalkylated products of benzene it has been the practice to maintain a molar excess of benzene throughout the reaction zone ranging from 4:1 to 16:1, and more preferably 8:1 of benzene to propylene. Two competing reactions with the desired production of isopropylbenzene have created problems in some commercial processes. One of these has been the formation of polyalkylated benzenes such as di- and triisopropylbenzene rather than the desired monoalkylated product. This competing reaction may be partially controlled by employing large molar excesses of benzene. However, a transalkylation reactor is employed to react polyalkylated benzenes with benzene to form additional cumene. The other competing reaction causing losses in the yield of cumene based on propylene reactant charged is the formation of oligomers of propylene such as propylene dimer and trimer which occur to a limited extent even with the large molar excesses of benzene present. Propylene trimers and some of the propylene tetramers boil widi cumene. Since the presence of these olefins interfere with the oxidation reaction used to make phenol from cumene, this oligomerization side reaction must be minimized to make a high purity product. [0004]      The alkylator and transalkylator effluents undergo separation operations to separate benzene, cumene product, polyisopropylbenzene , and by-product streams using distillation columns. Traditionally three distillation columns are used. The first is typically a benzene column, used to recover excess benzene from the reactor effluents. The benzene<br>
column overhead, which is largely benzene, is typically recycled to the alkylator and transalkylator. The second distillation column is typically a cumene column used to recover the cumene product from the benzene column bottoms. The cumene product is typically the net overhead from the cumene column. The cumene product may be used in applications such as phenol or acetone processes, or may be sent to storage. The third distillation column is usually a polyisopropylbenzene column used to recover polyisopropylbenzene recycle stream from the cumene column bottoms. Polyisopropylbenzene is recovered as overhead from the polyisopropylbenzene column and is typically recycled to the transalkylator. The high boiling bottoms, the heavy ends, is usually cooled and sent to storage.<br>
[0005]       Current process flow schemes are improved by replacing the benzene column and the cumene column with a single dividing wall column. The resulting advantages include a significant savings in the energy requirement and the total number of stages, a higher cumene purity and a reduction in benzene loss. Additional advantages include a reduction in capital costs associated with the reduced number of stages, reduction in exchanger surface area, and a reduction in the equipment count.<br>
[0006]       The dividing wall or Petyluk configuration for fractionation columns was initially introduced some 50 years ago by Petyluk et al. A recent commercialization of a fractionation column employing this technique prompted more recent investigations as described in the article appearing at page s 14 of a SUPPLEMENT TO THE CHEMICAL ENGINEER, 27 August 1992. [0007]       The use of dividing wall columns in the separation of hydrocarbons is also described in the patent literature. For instance, US 2,471,134 issued to R.O. Wright describes the use of a dividing wall column in the separation of light hydrocarbons ranging from methane to butane. US 4,230,533 issued to V.A. Giroux describes a control system for a dividing wall column and illustrates the use of the claimed invention in the separation of aromatics comprising benzene, toluene and orthoxylene.<br>
[0008]       Using a dividing wall column in the a cumene production process provides significant advantages over cumene production processes that do not employ a dividing wall fractionation column, as shown below.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0009]       A cumene generation process using a dividing wall fractionation zone has been developed. The process involves contacting, in an alkylation zone, a feed stream comprising at<br>
least propylene and a first benzene recycle stream comprising at least benzene with an alklyation catalyst under alkylation conditions to convert at least a portion of the propylene and benzene into cumene and form an alkylation zone effluent comprising benzene and cumene. Also, in a transalkylation zone, a polyisopropylbenzene recycle stream comprising at least polyisopropylbenzene and a second benzene recycle stream comprising at least benzene are contacted with a transalkylation catalyst under transalkylation conditions to convert at least a portion of the polyisopropylbenzene and benzene into cumene and form a transalkylation zone effluent comprising benzene and cumene. The alkylation zone effluent and the transalkylation zone effluent are passed into a dividing wall fractionation column which is operated at fractionation conditions. The dividing wall fractionation column is divided into at least a first and a second parallel fractionation zone by a dividing wall, with the first and the second fractionation zones each having an upper and a lower end located within the fractionation column, with the first and second fractionation zones being in open communication at their upper ends with an undivided upper section of the fractionation column and in open communication at their lower ends with an undivided lower section of the fractionation column. The alkylation zone effluent and the transalkylation zone effluent stream enters the column at one or more intermediate point(s) of the first fractionation zone.<br>
[0010]       A stream comprising cumene is removed from an intermediate point of the second fractionation zone of the dividing wall fractionation column. A first benzene recycle stream is removed from a first end of the dividing wall fractionation column. The second benzene recycle stream is removed from an intermediate point of the second fractionation zone of the dividing wall fractionation column, and a polyisopropylbenzene stream is removed from a second end of the dividing wall fractionation column. The polyisopropylbenzene stream is passed to a polyisopropylbenzene fractionation column to separate the polyisopropylbenzene recycle stream from a heavy aromatics stream.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
[0011]      The Figure is a schematic illustration of one embodiment of the present invention. The Figure does not show a number of details for the process arrangement such as pumps, compressors, valves, stabilizers and recycle lines which are well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0012]       Referring to the Figure, the process of the invention requires two reactors, an alkylation reactor 2, or alkylator, and a transalkylation reactor 4, or transalkylator. Propylene feedstock 6 and an excess of benzene 8 are introduced to alkylator 2. A-typical propylene feedstock may be an almost pure polymer grade material or can contain significant amounts of propane, as typically found in refinery-grade propylene. A typical benzene feedstock may contain benzene (99.9 wt.-% min.) and toluene (0.05 wt.-% min). Alkylation reactors may be operated in the vapor phase, liquid-phase or mixed-phase. It is preferred to operate the alkylation reactor in the liquid phase. At the lower temperatures of the liquid phase operation, xylene impurities are not produced and an cumene product of superior quality is produced. In one embodiment, the temperature of the alkylation reactor is selected from the range of 100°C to 310°C (212 to 590°F) and the pressure is selected from the range of 800 to 5100 kPa (116 to 740 psia). In a more specific embodiment die temperature is in the range of 120 to 280°C (248 to 536°F) and the pressure is in the range of from 1000 to 3900 kPa (145 to 565 psia). Alkylation reactor 2 contains an effective amount of alkylation catalyst. Suitable alkylation catalysts include solid acid catalysts and preferably a solid oxide zeolite. Examples are zeolite beta, zeolite X, zeolite Y, mordenite, faujastte, zeolite omega, UZM-8, MCM-22, MCM-36, MCM-49 and MCM-56. Alkylation reactors, operating conditions and catalysts are known in the art and not further discussed here.<br>
[0013]       In alkylation reactor 2, the benzene is alkylated with the propylene to form isopropylbenzene, or cumene. Some polyisopropylbenzenes, which are mainly di- and tri-substituted propylbenzenes, are also formed. Other heavy aromatic byproducts having from 16 to  24 carbon atoms may also be formed. Benzene is fed to the alkylator in excess so that virtually all the propylene is reacted. Therefore, alkylation reactor effluent 10 contains primarily benzene, cumene and polyisopropylbenzenes.<br>
[0014]       Transalkylation reactor 4 is used to form additional cumene through transalkylating the polyisopropylbenzene produced in the alkylation reactor and recycled in line 43 with benzene recycled in line 20. Suitable conditions and catalysts may be the same as described for the alkylaticar reachor Examples of suitable transalkylation catalysts are zeolite beta, zeolite X, zeolite Y inurucuue, raujasite, zeolite omega, UZM-8, MCM-22, MCM-36, MCM-49 and MCM-56. In one embodiment, the temperature is selected from the range of 100°C to 270°C (212 to 518°F) and the pressure is selected from the range of 800 to 5100 kPa (116 to 740 psia).<br>
In another more specific embodiment, the temperature is 129°C (264°F) and the pressure ranges from 1000 to 3900 kPa (145 to 565 psia). Transalkylation reactors, operating conditions and catalysts are known in the art and not further discussed here. The transalkylation effluent 12 from transalkylation reactor 4 contains primarily benzene, ethylbenzene and polyethylbenzene. [0015]       Both alkylation effluent 10 and transalkylation effluent 12 are introduced to cumene/benzene dividing wall fractionation distillation column 14. Wimin the dividing wall fractionation distillation column are two parallel fractionation zones. A first fractionation zone occupies a large portion of the left-hand side of the mid-section of the fractionation distillation column. Note that the terms "left-hand" and "right-hand" are used herein as relative to the drawings. In actual practice the placement of the zones as to the left side or the right side of the column is not critical. This first fractionation zone is separated from a parallel second fractionation zone occupying the other half of the column cross section by a substantially fluid tight vertical wall 16. The vertical wall is not necessarily centered in the column and the two fractionation zones may differ in cross sectional area or shape. The vertical wall divides a large vertical portion of the column into two parallel fractionation zones. The two zones are isolated from each other for the height of this wall, but communicate at both the top and bottom ends of the column. There is no direct vapor or liquid flow between the two fractionation zones through the dividing wall, but the upper end of the fractionation zone is open to the internal volume of the distillation column containing an undivided fractionation zone preferably having additional trays. Liquid may pass under the dividing wall at the bottom of the two fractionation sections although vapor flow is preferably restricted or controlled. Thus, vapor and liquid can freely move around the wall between the two portions of the column. [0016]      During operation, the components of both effluents are separated in the first fractionation zone with the more volatile compounds moving upward out of me left-hand first fractionation zone and emerging into the undivided upper portion of the distillation column. As with the first fractionation zone, the upper end of the right-hand second zone is in open communication with the upper section of the distillation column which may optionally contain additional fractionation trays extending across the entire column cross section. [0017]       The components of the effluent will separate according to boiling point or relative volatilities, which is the main factor in determining their behavior in the distillation column. The component having a relatively low boiling point is the benzene from each of the<br>
effluents. The mid-range boiling component is the desired product, cumene. The components having relatively high boiling points are the polyisopropylbenzene and any heavy aromatics. [0018]       The transalkylation effluent 12 and the alkylation effluent 10 are introduced into a first vertical fractionation zone occupying a large portion of the left-hand side of the midsection of the fractionation distillation column. The effluent may be combined before being introduced, but advantages may be realized by introducing the effluents at different heights along the dividing wall fractionation distillation column. The alkylation reactor effluent may contain a higher concentration of polyisopropylbenzene and therefore it may be advantageous to introduce the alkylation reactor effluent at a relatively lower height along the column as compared to the transalkylation reactor effluent. In one embodiment the dividing wall fractionation distillation column is operated so that the overhead pressure is 7 kPa (1 psia) and 38°C (100°F).<br>
[0019]       The benzene present in the effluents is driven upward in the first fractionation zone and enter the top section of the column where it is removed in overhead 18 and side draw 20. Benzene in overhead 18 is removed from the top of the dividing wall column and passed through an overhead condenser 38 to form liquid delivered to receiver 22. Receiver 22 may have a vent stream 21. A liquid phase stream of benzene 26 is removed from the receiver and divided into a first portion 28 which is returned to the top of the dividing wall fractionation column as reflux and a second portion 8 which is recycled to the alkylation reactor 2. Benzene may also be removed from dividing wall column in stream 20 which is a side draw. Benzene stream 20 may be recycled to transalkylation reactor 4. Two benzene streams are withdrawn from the benzene column because the catalysts typically used in the alkylation reactor can tolerate some water present during the alkylation reaction, but the catalysts typically used in the transalkylation reactor are less tolerant of water. Therefore, the overhead contains benzene which may be saturated with water and is appropriate for the alkylation reactor, while the side draw contains dry or semi-dry benzene which is appropriate for the transalkylation reactor. As used herein the term "rich" is intended to indicate a concentration of the indicated compound or class of compounds greater than 50 and preferably greater than 75 mol-%.<br>
[0020]       The bottom of the dividing wall fractionation column 14 also comprises an undivided fractionation zone. This zone can receive liquid draining from both the first and second fractionation zones. The liquid is subjected to fractionation distillation which drives<br>
the cumene upwards as vapor while concentrating the less volatile polyisopropylbenzene and heavy aromatics into a bottoms liquid 34 that is removed from dividing wall fractionation column 14. This separation is effected through the use of reboiler 36 providing vapor to the bottom undivided fractionation zone. The product cumene stream 32 is withdrawn from the dividing wall fractionation column in a side draw from the right-hand side fractionation zone. Bottoms stream 34 is passed to polyisopropylbenzene separation column 40. In one embodiment the dividing wall fractionation distillation column is operated so that the overhead pressure is in the range of from 7 to 14 kPa (1 to 2 psia) and 30 to 45°C (86 to 113°F). In another embodiment the dividing wall fractionation distillation column is operated so that the overhead pressure is 7 kPa (1 psia) and 38°C (100°F).<br>
[0021]       In a more specific embodiment of the invention, the undivided bottom section of the dividing wall fractionation column is depicted as separated from me two parallel fractionation zones by a gas flow control or gas trap-out tray located just below the bottom of the wall. A slight gap at this point allows horizontal liquid flow between the parallel fractionation zones. This tray may have liquid sealed perforations allowing the normal downward flow of liquid, but its structure is such that the upward flow of vapor is at least greatly restricted or controlled. The tray may totally block the upward vapor flow. The use of this tray may provide a means to positively control the division of the upward gas flow between the two fractionation zones, which is a prime means of controlling performance of the two zones. Optionally, reflux may also be separately controlled. The total column bottoms may be, therefore, preferably routed from the column via a line and split between two lines which feed the vapor to the bottom of the two parallel fractionation zones separately. The gas flow may be controlled by one or more flow control valves or by adjusting the relative liquid levels in the bottom of the two zones. This is described in some detail in US 4,230,533. [0022]       A net portion of bottoms stream 34 containing primarily polyisopropylbenzene and heavy aromatics is passed to polyisopropylbenzene column 40 for the separation of polyisopropylbenzene into polyisopropylbenzene column overhead 42, and heavy aromatics into polyisopropylbenzene column bottoms 44. Polyisopropylbenzene column overhead 42 containing primarily polyisopropylbenzene is passed through receiver 46 and a portion is returned to the top portion of polyisopropylbenzene column 40 as reflux. The remainder of the stream 43 is recycled to transalkylation reactor 4. In one embodiment the column is operated so that the overhead temperature is from 85°C to 105°C (185 to 221°F) and the<br>
pressure is from 16 to 19 kPa (2.3 to 2.7 psia). In a more specific embodiment the column is operated so that the overhead temperature is 95°C (203°F) and the pressure is 17 kPa (2.5 psia).<br>
[0023]       The theoretical modeling results shown in Table 2 indicate that the separation performed in the present invention would compare favorably to that achieved using a conventional scheme employing a benzene column followed by a cumene column. The data is based solely upon engineering design calculations and indicates mat two conventional fractionation columns (the benzene column and the cumene column) could be replaced with a dividing wall column to provide significant benefits and costs savings. Energy costs as well as the total number of stages are reduced with the dividing wall column as compared to the conventional two columns in series.<br>
[0024]       When designing distillation units, often the number of stages in a unit must be balanced with the energy requirements of the unit. In the theoretical modeling described herein, two different dividing wall column (DWC) designs were modeled. One (case 1) has a greater number of stages and a lower energy requirement, while the other (case 2) has a lower number of stages but a higher energy requirement. The design data for each of the systems modeled are provided in Table 1.<br>
TABLE 1<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
[0025]       Table 2 shows the results of the modeling. As clearly shown by the data, each of the dividing wall column designs provided both an energy savings and a reduction in the number of stages as compared to the conventional two column design. For example, the dividing wall column case 1 requires a total condenser duty of 25.6 MMBTU/hr, and the dividing wall column case 2 requires a total condenser duty of 26.5 MMBTU/hr versus 32.3<br>
MMBTU/hr for the two conventional columns. Similarly, the dividing wall column case 1 requires a total reboiler duty of 25.3 MMBTU/hr, and the dividing wall column case 2 requires a total reboiler duty of 26.3 MMBTU/hr versus 31 MMBTU/hr for the two conventional columns. As to the number of stages, the dividing wall column case 1 requires 67 stages, and the dividing wall column case 2 requires 62 stages versus 78 total stages for the two conventional columns. Finally, the data shows there is a small increase in cumene purity and a decrease in the amount of benzene lost to vent. Therefore, the use of the dividing wall column reduces the capital costs as to the number of trays as well as the utility costs as compared to a set of conventional fractionation columns.<br>
