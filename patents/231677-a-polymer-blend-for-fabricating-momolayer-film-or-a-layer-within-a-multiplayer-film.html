				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates generally to polymer blends for fabricating films and more particularly films that have low distortion and are non-adherent upon steam sterilization, are heat scalable and are suitable for fabricating into flexible medical containers.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the medical field, where beneficial agents are collected, processed and stored in containers, transported, and ultimately delivered through tubes by infusion to patients to achieve therapeutic effects, materials which are used to fabricate the containers must have a unique combination of properties. For example, visual inspection of solutions for particulate contamination requires an optically transparent container. The material which forms the wall must be sufficiently flexible to infuse a solution by collapsing the container walls, without introducing air into the container. The material must maintain its flexibility and toughness over a wide range of temperatures. The material must maintain its flexibility and toughness at low temperatures because some solutions, for example, certain premixed drug solutions, are stored and transported in containers at temperatures such as -25 to -30[deg.] C. to minimize the drug degradation. The material must also be functional and resist distortion at high temperatures to withstand the heat of steam sterilization; a process which most medical fluid containers and nutritional products are subjected to prior to shipment. The sterilization process usually includes exposing the container to steam at temperatures typically 121[deg.] C. and at elevated pressures.<br>
For ease of manufacture into useful articles, it is desirable that the material be scalable using heat sealing techniques. The material therefore must maintain sufficient thermoplastic properties to melt upon heating.<br>
A further requirement is to minimize the environmental impact upon the disposal of the article fabricated from the material after its intended use. For those articles that are disposed of in landfills, it is desirable to minimize or avoid the incorporation of low molecular weight leachable components to construct the article. Further benefits are realized by using a material that allows thermal reprocessing of scrap material produced during manufacturing.<br>
For those containers which are disposed of through incineration to minimize biological hazards.<br><br>
it is desirable to use a material that minimizes or eliminates the formation of environmentally undesirable and corrosive inorganic acids.<br>
It is also desirable that the material be free from or have a low content of low molecular weight additives such as plasticizers, stabilizers and the like which could be released into the medications or biological fluids.<br>
Due to its ability to meet a wide variety of functional requirements, flexible polyvinyl chloride (PVC) has frequently been the material of choice for medical bag applications. PVC also offers the distinct advantage of being one of the most cost-effective materials for constructing devices that meet the above requirements. However, PVC has a number of disadvantages in the marketplace. These disadvantages include incompatibility of PVC compounds with certain drugs, concerns regarding chlorine content and its effects on the environment and a growing negative market perception of PVC in general. Thus, many materials have been devised to replace PVC. However, most alternate materials are too expensive to implement and still do not meet all of the above requirements.<br>
Polyolefms and polyolefin alloys have been developed which meet many of the requirements of medical containers and tubing, without the disadvantages associated with PVC. Polyolefms typically are compatible with medical applications because they have relatively low extractability to fluids. Most polyolefins are environmentally sound as they do not generate harmful degradants upon incineration, and are suitable for thermoplastic recycling. Many polyolefins are cost effective materials that may provide an economic alternative to PVC. However, there are many hurdles to overcome to replace all the favorable attributes of PVC with a polyolefin.<br>
For example, problems have been encountered in using certain polyolefins to fabricate medical tubing. Such tubing has been found to have poor surface characteristics so that it is readily susceptible to cutting, shredding or scoring when clamping the tubing using a slide clamp. Also, certain polyolefins that have favorable modulus attributes, such as ultra-low density polyethylenes, have melting point temperatures below that reached during an autoclave process.<br>
It is well known that cross linking by chemical agents or by high energy ionizing radiation increases heat resistance of the polymer matrix. The chemical crosslinks are covalent bonds<br><br>
across separate polymer chains that greatly retard the tendency to deform and flow at high temperatures-even above the melting point of the polymer. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,465,487 assigned to Terumo discloses fabricating steam autoclavable medical containers by irradiating ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers with high energy (2 Mev) electron beams at doses between 50 kGy and 100 kGy to achieve gel contents of between 50% and 85%. The '487 Patent discloses that if the EVA sidewalls of the container are irradiated to achieve a gel content of about 50% or higher before being sealed together they are easily peeled apart. (Col. 4, lines 20-30). Accordingly, the '487 patent discloses irradiating the sidewalls of the container after sealing the container into a pouch leaving only a port area unsealed.<br>
Similarly, U.S. Pat. No. 4,453,940 discloses fabricating medical containers from EVA and other materials. The '940 patent also discloses the step of increasing the autoclave resistance of EVA by cross-linking the material with high energy electron beam. The '940 patent warns that if the cross-linking exceeds 50% the use of heat sealing becomes impossible. (Col. 4, lines 27-35).<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,401,536 discloses crosslinking semi-rigid containers composed of blends of polypropylene and EVA or EEA. This patent does not disclose the use of ethylene alpha olefins with polypropylene. It also discloses that irradiation before forming results in articles with poor heat scalability (Col. 4, lines 25-28).<br>
U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,892,604 and 5,066,290 both assigned to the present assignee, disclose a medical container with a coextruded high density polyethylene skin layer arid a core layer of an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer having about 18% vinyl acetate content. After the container is fabricated by conventional radio frequency heat seal, the assembly is subjected to ionizing radiation of about 100 kGy from a high energy electron beam accelerator of about 5 Mev. The high density polyethylene layer acts as a moisture and gas transmission barrier to maintain the sterile fluid content at a relatively constant concentration as required by various pharmacopoeia of the world. However, several serious deficiencies were apparent in this material construction: 1) to fabricate a container from this material construction the container must be fabricated before the cross-linking process, since the cross-linked EVA layer is difficult if not impossible to seal (this renders the manufacturing process very inefficient); and 2) the radiation dose required for sufficient cross-linking also releases significant quantities of acetic acid-a by-product of the radiation exposure. Since the HDPE presents a barrier to gas transmission, the trapped acetic acid can render the fluid contents quite acidic-a very undesirable outcome.<br><br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,643,926 assigned to W. R. Grace discloses fabricating a medical solution container from a multilayered material where, in certain embodiments, the layer intended to be heat sealed is constructed with polypropylene as the main ingredient. Since it is well known that polypropylenes undergo chain scission when exposed to radiation, the heat seal layer remained thermoplastic and capable of being heat-sealed to similar surfaces. Therefore, the entire multilayer film can be heat-sealed and survive autoclaving. However, the complexity of the multilayer construction and the possible need of washing and incorporating acid scavenging compounds in the film (See U.S. Pat. No. 5,445,893) to remove the acidic by-products of irradiating EVA renders the process quite complicated and the cost very high. Further, since the film is constructed of several very dissimilar materials, process recycling of the edge trim and other film scraps is very difficult and impractical without greatly reducing the optical and mechanical properties.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,055,328 discloses a multilayer differentially cross-linked film where the heat-sealed layer contains additional antioxidants to retard cross-linking and to facilitate heat-sealing post cross-linking. Likewise, Canadian Patent 1,125,229 discloses another differential cross-linked multilayer film where the outer layer contains a cross-link enhancer. However, these constructions are all multilayer constructions and do not address the issue of self adhesion during autoclaving.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,724,176 to Sun discloses a multilayer, oriented, heat shrinkable container with a radiation cross-linked outer layer and, by controlling the irradiation process, a non cross-linked inner seal layer. The inner and outer layers can be of EVA copolymers. This container is designed to shrink upon application of heat, and, therefore, would be unsuitable for a container that must maintain substantially its entire volume after an autoclave process.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide polymeric materials that are, overall, superior to those materials, of which we are* aware, which have been heretofore known in the art or have been commercially used or marketed. The properties of such materials include flexibility, optical transparency for visual inspection, and sufficient thermal resistance to withstand a steam sterilization process at temperatures up to 121 [deg.] C. without experiencing significant distortion or self adhesion. The materials should also be non-oriented, non-adherent and capable of being sealed using heat sealing techniques. The materials should also be<br><br>
substantially free of low molecular weight leachable additives, and capable of safe disposal by incineration without the generation of significant amounts of corrosive inorganic acids. Finally, the material should serve as a cost-effective alternative to various PVC formulations currently being used for medical devices.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,879,768 discloses a pouch for packaging flowable materials fabricated from a material having a seal layer of a polymeric composition comprising: (A) 10 to 100 percent of a mixture of (1) from 5 to 95% of at least one homogeneously branched substantially linear ethylene/[alpha]-olefm interpolymer, and (2) from 5 to 95% of high pressure low density polyethylene having a density from 0.916-0.930 g/cc; and (B) from 0-90% of one polymer selected from the group consisting of an ultra low density polyethylene, a linear low density polyethylene, a high pressure low density polyethylene, an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer, and a homogeneously branched linear ethylene polymer. The '768 patent does not disclose exposing this blend to radiation nor does it disclose blending the homogeneously branched, substantially linear ethylene/[alpha]-olefin interpolymer with polypropylene.<br>
When more than one polymer is blended to form an alloying composition, it is difficult to achieve all of the above objectives simultaneously. For example, many alloys produce significant light scattering; thus, they fail to meet the optical clarity objective. The light scattering intensity (measured by haze) depends on the domain size of components in the micrometer ([mu]) range, and the proximity of the refractive indices of the components. As a general rule, the selection of components that can be satisfactorily processed into very small domain sizes, and yet with a minimum of refractive index mismatches, is a difficult task. The present invention is provided to solve these and other problems.<br>

When the flowable material container is an I.V. container it is desirable the container collapse or substantially collapse upon draining, and, therefore, should have a modulus of elasticity of less than about 40,000 psi, more preferably less than about 30,000 psi, and even more preferably less than about 20,000 when measured in accordance with ASTM D-882.<br>
For the purposes of this invention, self adhesion is defined as the tendency of the film to adhere to itself during autoclaving. This property can be determined with the following test. Film strips are cut 8"*2", with the larger dimension in the machine direction. These strips are rolled into 2" long tubes approximately 0.5" in diameter. The wound film is held in place by compressing the film layers together at one end with a paper clip. The tubes are then placed in a steam autoclave at 121 [deg.] C. for 30 minutes. The samples are allowed to cool for at least one hour. The film is then unwound. The resistance to unwinding and relative damage to the film is ranked as shown in Table 1 as follows:Table IRank Observed Result<br><br>
1	The film cannot be unwound without destroying the film.<br>
2	The film is difficult to peel and significant surface damage results.<br>
3	Some resistance to peeling and minor surface damage are noted.<br>
4	Slight resistance to peeling noted with little or no surface damage.<br>
5	No peel resistance and no surface damage noted.<br>
Ranks are determined by three or more individuals and recorded as an average.<br>
Adhesion to over pouch materials is determined by the following qualitative test. One inch wide strips of film are sealed into typical over pouch bags (medium or high density polyethylene). The over pouch bag is then placed into a laboratory autoclave at 252[deg.] F. and 24.5 psig gauge pressure for one hour. After autoclaving, the bags are cut open and the strips removed. If the films separate from the over pouch without leaving damage marks on the film surface, a ranking of no adhesion (N) is given If the film separation produces visible damage, a ranking is given (Y) indicating that tack to the over pouch is present. A ranking to indicate slight adhesion (S) can also be given.<br>
Creep properties were determined at 120[deg.] C. by clamping film strips having a thickness from about 5 mils to about 15 mils in a temperature controlled oven and loading with weights to produce a stress of about 27 psi. After loading for 40 minutes, the film strips were removed and the dimensional changes in a pre-marked one inch gap were recorded.<br>
The film is capable of being sealed using standard heat sealing techniques. An adequate heat seal is formed when a fluid container, such as the one shown in FIG. 3, is fabricated from the film by sealing peripheral edges to define a centrally disposed fluid chamber. The container is filled with water and subjected to a standard autoclave sterilization process. Adequate heat seals remain intact upon completion of the autoclave cycle.<br>
The films of the present invention have a haze of less than about 25% and most preferably less<br><br>
than about 15% when measured in accordance with ASTM D1003. For the purposes of this invention, internal haze is defined as the haze value measured when both film surfaces have been wetted with isopropyl alcohol.<br>
II. Polymer and Film Processing<br>
To produce the film of the present invention, raw materials are fed into an extrusion hopper at the desired mix ratio employing weight feeders. The materials are extruded using an extrusion die to produce a mono-layer film. The film is irradiated with a suitable energy source and then sealed to form a fluid container. It is also contemplated exposing the blend to radiation before extrusion. The raw materials can also be pre-compounded before extrusion employing a single screw, twin screw or other compounding methods familiar to those skilled in the art.<br>
The preferred method of irradiating the film is to expose it to an electron beam with beam energy from about 150 Kev-10 Mev, more preferably from 200-300 Kev and a dosage from about 20 kGys to about 200 kGys and more preferably from about 60-150 kGys. Alternatively, the film can be crosslinked using methods known to those skilled in the arts. Methods for crosslinking employed in the industry include exposure to ionizing radiation (gamma, beta, ultraviolet, etc.) and chemical (peroxides and condensing reactions).<br>
To reduce or minimize the oxidative degradation of the film during and subsequent to electron beam exposure, it is desirable to reduce the partial pressure of oxygen in the area surrounding the film being exposed to the radiation. The oxygen partial pressure may be reduced by applying a vacuum or by applying another gas such as nitrogen under pressure or other known techniques for accomplishing this goal. In a preferred form of the invention the oxygen concentration during a nitrogen flush is less than about 100 ppm and more preferably less than about 40 ppm.<br>
III. Multilayer Films<br>
FIG. 2 shows an example of a multilayer film 20 including layer 12 of the mono-layer described above. In a preferred form of the invention the mono-layer shall be the seal layer. The multilayer film 20 can include any additional layer 14 or combination of additional layers selected from layers such as a skin layer, a radio frequency susceptible layer, a water vapor barrier layer, a gaseous barrier layer, a scrap layer, a seal layer and a core layer to name a few.<br><br>
The skin layer can be added to increase the scuff resistance of the film. The skin layer can be an olefm material such as homopolymers and copolymers of propylene and ethylene. The skin layer may also be a polyester, copolyester, polyamide or copolyamide. The term "copolyester" and the like is applied to polyesters synthesized from more than one diol and a dibasic acid. Copolyesters as used herein may also be characterized as copolymers of polyether and polyethylene terephthalate. More preferably copolyesters as used herein may be characterized as polymeric materials derived from 1,4 cyclohexane dimethanol, 1,4 cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid, and polytetramethylene glycol ether, or equivalents of any of the above, as reactants.<br>
Suitable water vapor barriers include but are not limited to HDPE, MDPE and polyester (PET, PBT, PEN, etc.)<br>
Suitable gaseous barriers are those that inhibit the passage of oxygen, carbon dioxide or other gasses. Suitable gas barriers include but are not limited to polyesters and polyamides.<br>
Scrap material generated prior to irradiation can be incorporated into one or more layers. IV. Flowable Material Containers<br>
FIG. 3 shows a flowable material container and particularly an I.V. container 30. FIG. 4 shows an I.V. administration set 40 and FIG. 5 shows a peritoneal dialysis set 50. The present invention further contemplates fabricating medical tubing from the blends of the present invention. It is contemplated that the radiation treatment of tubing will differ from films due to the increased thickness and round shape of tubing but tubing can be effectively treated within the radiation energy ranges set forth above for the film. What is meant by "flowable material" is a material that will flow by the force of gravity. Flowable materials therefore include both liquid items and powdered or granular items and the like. The container 30 has sidewalls 32 placed in registration and sealed along peripheral edges to define a chamber 34 for containing flowable materials such as fluids or granular material. For containers made through blow molding only or blow extrusion longitudinal edges would be sealed. A port tube 36 or multiple port tubes are provided to fill and empty the contents of the container 30. The sidewalls and port tube can be fabricated from one of the monolayer or multiple layered films set forth above. Surprisingly, the medical articles<br><br>
fabricated from the films and blends described above can be heat sealed even though the film has<br>
been irradiated with electron beam radiation.<br>
Heat seals can be achieved using standard heat sealing techniques known to those skilled in the<br>
art.<br>
V. Dual Chamber Peelable Seal Containers<br>
FIG. 6 shows a dual chamber container 70 having a first chamber 72 and a second chamber 74<br>
separated by a peelable seal 76. The container sidewalls 75 are fabricated from one of the<br>
polymer blends, monolayer films or multiple layered films set forth above. Dual chamber<br>
containers can be used for numerous applications such as separately housing two components for<br>
mixing later. The components can be liquid or powdered. The peelable seal can be created by<br>
modifying the sealing conditions such that the peelable seal 76 is capable of being ruptured by<br>
applying a force to a sidewall 75 of the container. Typically, one of the chambers will contain a<br>
liquid. By pressing on the container sidewall 75 over the liquid containing chamber the liquid<br>
contents will flow toward the peelable seal 76 and by applying sufficient pressure the seal 76 will<br>
rupture to allow mixing of the components stored in the separate chambers.<br>
While FIG. 6 shows only one peelable seal 76, it is contemplated that numerous peelable seals could be provided to create numerous chambers. Further, FIG. 6 shows the peelable seal running between lateral edges. It is also contemplated that the peelable seals could extend between longitudinal edges or simply around an area not intersecting the permanent peripheral seam 79 to define a chamber.<br>
The peelable seal 76 may be created simultaneously with sealing the peripheral sidewalls or before or after the creation of the permanent peripheral seals. The peelable seal 76 can be created by controlling sealing conditions. Peelable seals can be created with the application of lower temperature and pressure than employed to provide the permanent peripheral seal or by shortening the sealing times from that used to provide the permanent seal or the like. Further enhancement of the peel characteristics can be obtained with localized modification of the film surface characteristics (corona or other suitable treatment).<br>
It is contemplated that the container can be sealed using ultrasonic welding techniques, conduction heat sealing techniques and other sealing techniques well known in the art. VI. Examples<br><br>
