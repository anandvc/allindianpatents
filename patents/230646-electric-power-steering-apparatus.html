DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS Embodiment 1<br>
■Embodiment 1 will be explained in reference to Fig. 1 through Fig. 4 . Fig. 1 is a sectional view of a DC brush motor for an electric power steering apparatus, Fig. 2 is a sectional view of a boss shown in Fig. 1, and Fig. 3 is a perspective view showing a behavior of attaching the DC brush motor to the electric power steering apparatus. Fig. 4 is an explanatory diagram showing a noise change rate relative to a weight rate. In Fig. 3, a DC brush motor 1 for the electric power steering apparatus is a motor for an electric power steering apparatus of a so-to-speak column type connected to be attached to a gear box 3 attached to a column 2, the DC brush motor 1 is arranged at inside of a vehicular compartment and is constituted to assist a steering force of a steering wheel A of a driver by being controlled to be conducted by a control apparatus, not<br><br>
illustrated.<br>
The DC brush motor 1 will be explained in reference to Fig. 1. An inner face of a yoke 5 in a shape of a bottomed cylinder is fixed with 4 poles of permanent magnets 6, an inner face of a bearing containing portion 7 formed integrally with the yoke 5 is contained with an outer ring of a first bearing 8 by so-to-speak clearance fitting having a clearance in view of assembling, and one end of an output shaft 9 is rotatably supported by the bearing 8. A brush 12 is brought into sliding contact with an outer peripheral face of a commutator 11 provided to an armature 10 having the output shaft 9 by being pressed by an elastic force of a spring 12a. A brush holder<br>
13	holding the brush 12 is fixed to a housing 15 by a screw<br>
14	. A vicinity of other end of the output shaft 9 is rotatably<br>
supported by a second bearing 16 an outer ring of which is<br>
press-fitted to be fixed to the housing 15, and an opening side<br>
of the yoke 5 is fixed to the housing 15 by a screw 15a. A<br>
boss 17 is constituted by a boss main body 18 and a providing<br>
portion 19.  The boss main body 18 is press-fitted to an end<br>
portion of the output shaft 9 slightly projected from the<br>
bearing 16 in an axial direction, the boss main body 18 and<br>
the output shaft 9 are brought into contact with both sides<br>
of end faces in the axial direction of an inner ring of the<br>
bearing 16 and integrally fixed thereto to pinch the inner ring<br>
of the bearing 16 in the axial direction by the boss main body<br><br>
18	and the output shaft 9, and the output shaft 9 is constituted<br>
to be prevented from being moved in the axial direction.<br>
A lead wire 20 for feeding electricity to the brush 12 is led out to outside of the DC brush motor 1 and is connected to a control apparatus, not illustrated. The armature 10 is constituted by press-fitting to fix a core 22 having 22 pieces of slots 21 to the output shaft 9, winding a wiring 23 around the slots 21 by a lap winding system and connecting the winding 23 to the commutator 11. The DC brush motor 1 is attached by fixing the housing 15 to the gear box 3 by a bolt, not illustrated, and the boss main body 18 is connected to an input shaft 24 provided to the gear box 3 to transmit a rotational force of the DC brush motor 1 to a side of the gear box 3. . In Fig. 2, according to the boss 17, the providing portion<br>
19	in a shape of a doughnut is press-fitted to be fixed to an<br>
outer periphery of the boss main body 18.  The boss main body<br>
18 is formed by a sintered member, includes an inner diameter<br>
portion 25 for being press-fitted to the output shaft 9, and<br>
a spline hole 26 for connecting to the input shaft 24 and is<br>
constituted to provide a' function of transmitting the<br>
rotational force of the DC brush motor 1 from the output shaft<br>
9 to the input shaft 24 by the boss main body 18 per se.  The<br>
providing portion 19 is constituted by forming an iron member<br>
in the doughnuts shape by cold forging,•and the providing<br>
portion 19 per se does not transmit the rotational force of<br><br>
the DC brush motor 1 from the output shaft 9 to the input shaft 24.<br>
In Fig. 4, the abscissa designates a weight rate (%) showing a rate of a weight of the boss 17 to a weight of a rotor of the DC brush motor 1 (boss weight/rotor weight) , and the ordinate designates a noise change rate (%) when the weight rate (%) is changed, which is found by the inventors through an experiment. The weight of the rotor is a weight of a rotating portion excluding the weight of the boss 17 (weight of so-to-speak armature 10) and is a total sum of weights of the output shaft 9, the commutator 11, the core 22 and the winding 23 and the like. A broken line indicated by notation A in the drawing designates a level of noise constituting a target, and as shown by the drawing, noise can be reduced by increasing the weight rate (%) and low noise formation constituting a target can be achieved by making the weight rate equal to or larger than 10%. It seems that by providing a proper weight member to a counter core side (side of the boss17) constituting a fulcrum by the bearing 16 relative to a portion of the core 22 occupying a large portion of the weight of the rotor, vibration of the armature 10 in a rotational direction, or a bending direction thereof can be attenuated or cancelled, sliding movement of the brush 12 is stabilized, particularly, noise of the brush can be reduced. Further, although noise can effectively be reduced by constituting the weight rate (%)<br><br>
in a range in which a change in the noise change rate (%) relative to a change in the weight rate (%) is large, when the weight rate (%) is excessively increased more than necessary, an influence is effected on an increase in the weight of the apparatus, strengths of the output shaft 9 and the bearingl6 and the like, further, there is a concern of effecting an. adverse influence on a steering feeling which is important for the electric power steering apparatus and therefore, it is preferable to set an upper limit in consideration of the point. As described above, according to the electric power steering apparatus of Embodiment 1, there is provided the boss 17 arranged between the output shaft 9 of the motor 1 and the input shaft 2 4 driven by the motor 1 for transmitting the<br>
rotational force of the motor 1 from the output shaft 9 to the<br>
i<br>
input shaft 24 by the boss 17 per se, the weight of the boss 17 is made to be equal to or larger than the weight of the rotor of the motor 1 and therefore, the electric power steering apparatus capable of reducing noise of the DC motor can be provided by a simple constitution and inexpensively. By increasing the weight of the boss 17, the electric power steering apparatus capable of being constituted inexpensively by minimizing addition of a new part or step and particularly reducing noise of brush can be provided.<br>
Further, the boss 17 is constituted by fixing the providing portion 19 to the outer periphery of the boss 17 and<br><br>
therefore, a material and a shape of the providing portion 19 can freely be selected. Although the boss main body 18 is constituted to provide the function of transmitting the rotational force of the DC brush motor 1 from the output shaft 9 to the input shaft 24 by the boss main body 18 per se, a function  of transmitting the rotational force is not needed for the providing portion 19 and therefore, the providing portion 19 can be constituted by a material having a large specific weight or an inexpensive material.<br>
Further, when the DC brush motor 1 is constituted by the so-to-speak column type attached to the column 2, a vibration condition and a temperature condition are alleviated in comparison with a so-to-speak rack type in which the DC brush motor 1 is attached to a rack shaft and arranged in an engine compartment and therefore, the apparatus preferable for the column type can be provided such that the apparatus can be constituted with inconsiderable influence on the strength or the like by increasing the weight of the boss 17 or providing the providing portion 19 and inexpensively, the low noise formation can easily be achieved or the like.<br>
Further, by constituting a total of the providing portion 19 by an elastic member of rubber or the like, transmission of vibration to the providing portion 19 or vibration of the providing portion 19 per se is restrained and noise can be reduced effectively.<br><br>
Embodiment 2<br>
Embodiment 2 will be explained in reference to Fig. 5 and Fig. 6. Fig. 5 is a sectional view of a boss arranged to the DC brush motor for the electric power steering apparatus of Fig. 1 similar to Fig. 2, and Fig. 6 is an explanatory diagram showing a noise change rate relative to a moment of inertia rate. In Fig. 5, the boss 17 is constituted by an integrated product formed by a sintered member, includes the inner diameter portion 25 for being press-fitted to the output shaft 9 and the spline hole 26 for being connected to the input shaft 24, and is constituted to provide the function of transmitting the rotational force of the DC brush motor 1 from the output shaft 9 to the input shaft 24 by the boss 17 per se. The other constitution is constructed by a constitution similar to that of Embodiment 1 and a detailed explanation thereof will be omitted.<br>
In Fig. 6, the abscissa designates a moment of inertia rate (%) showing a rate of a moment of inertia of the boss 17 to a moment of inertia of the rotor of the DC brush motor 1 (moment of inertia of boss/moment of inertia of rotor) , and the ordinate designates the noise change rate (%) when the moment of inertia rate (%) is changed, which is found by the inventors through an experiment. The moment of inertia of the rotor is a moment of inertia of a rotating portion excluding the boss 17 (so-to-speak moment of inertia of armature). A<br><br>
broken line indicated by notation B in the drawing designates a level of noise constituting a target, as shown by the drawing, noise can be reduced by increasing the moment of inertia rate<br>
(%), and low noise formation constituting a target can be achieved by making the moment of inertia rate equal to or larger than 10%. It seems that vibration in the rotational direction or the bending direction of the armature 10 can be attenuated or cancelled by providing a proper moment of inertia to a counter core side (side of the boss 17) constituting a fulcrum by the bearing 16 relative to a portion of the core 22 occupying a large portion of the,moment of inertia of the rotor, sliding movement of the brush 12 is stabilized and particularly, noise of the brush can be reduced. Further, although noise can effectively be reduced by constituting the moment of ine.rtia rate (%) in a range in which a change in the noise change rate<br>
(%) relative to a change in the moment of inertia rate (%) is large, when the moment of inertia rate (%) is excessively increased more than necessary, an influence is "effected on the strength or the like of the apparatus, particularly, there is a concern of effecting an adverse influence on a steering feeling of rotational following performance or the like important for the electric power steering apparatus and therefore, it is preferable to set an upper limit of the moment of inertia rate (%) to a degree of capable of compensating for the influence of the inertia by the control apparatus of the.<br><br>
electric power steering apparatus.<br>
As described above, according to the electric power steering apparatus of Embodiment 2, there is provided the boss 17 arranged between the DC brush motor 1 and the output shaft 9 of the motor 1 and the input shaft 24 driven by the motor for transmitting the rotational force of the motor 1 from the output shaft 9 to the input shaft 24 by the boss 17 per se, the moment of inertia of the boss 17 is made to be equal to or larger than 10% of the moment of inertia of the rotor of the motor 1 and therefore, the electric power steering apparatus capable of reducing noise of the DC brush motor 1 can be provided by a simple constitution and inexpensively. The electric power steering apparatus capable of being constituted inexpensively by minimizing addition of a new part or step and reducing -particularly noise of the brush can be provided by increasing the moment of inertia of. the boss 17, further, by constituting the boss 17 by increasing the diameter thereof, the moment of inertia can effectively be increased and an increase in the weight of the boss 17 can be -restrained.<br>
Further, the boss 17 is constituted by an integrated product formed by the sintered member and therefore, the boss 17 can inexpensively be constituted without an increase in a number of parts. Further, although a similar effect is achieved when the boss 17 is constituted by an integrated product  formed by cold forging and can comparatively<br><br>
inexpensively be constituted in comparison with a case of integrally forming the boss, 17 by the sintered member, an accuracy of the steering portion is frequently deteriorated slightly.<br>
Further, although an explanation has been given of the boss 17 by providing the providing portion 19 in Embodiment 1 and an explanation has been given of the boss 17 by constituting the boss 17 by the integrated product formed by the sintered member in Embodiment 2, the constitution of the boss 17 may naturally be constituted by reversing Embodiment 1 and Embodiment 2. Embodiment 3<br>
Embodiment 3 will be explained in reference to Fig. 7. Fig. 7 is a sectional .view of a boss arranged to the DC brush motor for the electric power steering apparatus of Fig. 1 similar to Fig. 2 or Fig. 5, the other constitution is constructed by a constitution similar to that of Embodiment 1 or Embodiment 2 and a detailed explanation thereof will be omitted. In Fig. 7,. the boss 17 is fixed by press-fitting the inner periphery of the providing portion 19 in the doughnut shape to the outer periphery of the boss main body 18. The boss main body 18 is formed by a sintered member, includes the inner diameter portion 25 for being press-fitted to the output  shaft 9 and the spline hole 26 for being connected to the input shaft 2 4 and is constituted to provide the function of<br><br>
transmitting the rotational force of the DC brush motor 1 from the output shaft 9 to the input shaft 24 by the boss main body 18 per se. The providing portion 19 is constituted by forming an iron member in the doughnut shape by cold forging, arranging two pieces (19a 19b) thereof in a diameter direction and interposing an elastic member 19c having a viscoelasticity therebetween. Further, the providing portion 19 per se does not transmit the rotational force of the DC brush motor 1 from the output shaft 9 to the input shaft 24.<br>
As described above, according to the electric power steering apparatus of Embodiment 3, the providing portion 19 is constituted by interposing the elastic member 19c at a portion of the providing portion 19 and therefore, transmission of vibration to the providing portion 19 or vibration of the providing portion 19 per se is restrained and noise can further effectively be reduced. The elastic member 19c may be interposed between an outer face of the boss member 18 and the providing portion 19b fixed thereto. Embodiment 4<br>
Embodiment 4 will be explained in reference to Fig. 8. Fig. 8 is a sectional view of the boss 17 arranged between the output shaft 9 of the DC brush motor 1 for the electric power steering apparatus and the input shaft 24 of the gear box 3 and the boss 17 of Embodiment 4 is shown by the boss 17 fixed to a side of the input shaft 24. The other constitution is<br><br>
constructed by a constitution similar to those of Embodiment 1 through Embodiment 3 and a detailed explanation will be omitted. In Fig. 8, the boss 17 is constituted by an integrated product formed by a sintered member, includes an inner diameter portion 25a for being press-fitted to the input shaft 24 and a spline hole 26a provided on.the side of the output shaft 9 of the DC brush motor 1 for being connected to the spline and is constituted to provide the function of transmitting the rotational force of the DC brush motor 1 from the output shaft 9 to the input shaft 24 by the boss 17 per se. The spline provided at the end portion of the output shaft 9 of the DC brush motor 1 is connected to the spline hole-26a of the boss 17 press-fitted to the input shaft 24 to transmit the rotational force.<br>
As described above, according to the electric power steering apparatus of Embodiment 4, there is provided the boss 17 fixed to the side of the input shaft 24, and an effect equivalent to that of Embodiment 1 or Embodiment 2 can be achieved by constituting the weight rate (%) or the moment of inertia rate (%) of the boss 17 by that of Embodiment 1 or Embodiment 2. Further, the constitution of fixing the boss 17 to the output shaft 9 can reduce noise further effectively since in comparison with the constitution of fixing the boss 17 to the input-shaft 24, the connecting portion of the spline or the like is not interposed.<br><br>
Further, although according to the respective embodiments, an explanation, has been given of the boss 17 including the spline, a connecting method of an Oldham type or the like connected by way of recessed and projected claw portions will naturally do.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
