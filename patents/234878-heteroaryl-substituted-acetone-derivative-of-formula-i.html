				<td>The present invention relates to novel heteroaryl substituted acetone derivatives inhibiting the phospholipase A2 enzyme. These compounds are suited as drugs for preventing and treating diseases caused or contributorily caused by an increased activity of this enzyme, such as inflammations, pain, fever, allergies, asthma, psoriasis and endotoxic shock. The invention also relates to methods of synthesizing these compounds as well as pharmaceutical preparations containing these compounds.<br>
The term "phospholipase A2" comprises the major and diverse group of enzymes which cleave phospholipids at the sn-2 position thereby forming free fatty acids and lysophospholipids. If the released fatty acid is arachidonic acid, the latter can be metabolized into the prostaglandins and thromboxanes via the cyclooxygenase route and into the leukotrienes and other hydroxylated fatty acids via the lipoxygenase route. The prostaglandins are considerably involved in the formation of pain and fever and in inflammatory responses. Leukotrienes are important mediators in the case of inflammatory processes and anaphylactic and allergic processes (Forth et al., Allgemeine und Spezielle Pharmakologie und Toxikologie, Spektrum Akademischer Verlag Heidelberg, Berlin, Oxford, 1998).<br>
The lysophospholipids formed by phospholipase A2 have cell-damaging properties. Lysophosphatidylserine releases the histamine involved in allergic processes (Moreno et al., Agents Actions 1992, 36, 258). In addition, lysophosphatidylcholine is metabolized into the platelet-activating factor (PAF) which is also an important mediator, e.g. in the case of inflammations.<br><br>
Various phosphoiipase A2 forms are known. They comprise Ca2+-dependent low-molecular secretory phospholipases A2 (sPLAa), CA2+-independent high-molecular phospholipases A2 (iPLA2), CA2+-dependent high-molecular cytosolic phospholipases A2 (cPLA2) and Ca2+-independent lipoprotein-associated phospholipases A2 (LP-PLA2), formerly also referred to as PAF acetylhydrolase (Six et at., Biochim. Biophys. Acta., 2000, 1488, 1-19). According to the current state of knowledge, the cytosolic phosphoiipase A2 (CPLA2) plays the key role in the biosynthesis of prostaglandins, leukotrienes, PAFs and fysophospholipids. This was demonstrated inter alia by studies with CPLA2 knock-out mice, i.e. mice no longer having this enzyme (Uozumi et at., Nature 1997, 390, 618-622; Bonventre et at., Nature 1997, 390, 622-625, Dennis et at., Journal of Experimental Medicine 2002, 196,349-357).<br>
Thus, excess stimulation of this enzyme can result in a number of chronic and acute diseases, such as asthma, cerebral ischemia (Clemens etal., Stroke 1996, 27, 527-535), Alzheimer's disease (Stephenson et a!., Neurobiology of Stroke, 1996, 3, 51-63), rheumatoid arthritis (Huang et a!., Mediators of Inflammation, 1994, 3,307-308), chronic skin diseases and damage to the skin caused by U.V. rays (Gresham etal., American Journal of Physiology1996,270, C1037-C1050).<br>
Inhibitors of cPLA2 can thus be useful for a number of inflammatory diseases.<br>
Inhibitors of cytosolic Phosphoiipase A2 have already been described in the literature (Lehr, Drugs of the Future, 2000, 25, 823-832).<br>
For example, 1,3-disubstituted propan-2-one compounds of AstraZeneca company are known (Connolly et al., Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 2002, 45, 1348-1362) WO 00/34254 discloses compounds having an inhibitory effect on cytosolic phosphoiipase A2. Patent specifications U.S. 6,414,179, U.S. 2002/0037875 and U.S. 2002/0065246 disclose alpha amino-substituted, thio-substttuted and oxo-substituted ketones as well as alpha-substituted and beta-substituted trifluoromethylketones as inhibitors of cytosolic phosphoiipase A2. Moreover, EP 976 748 discloses certain pyrrolidine derivatives as inhibitors of cytosolic Phosphoiipase A2.<br>
This document refers to the compounds containing phenyl groups while the compounds of the present invention contain heteroaryl groups.<br><br>
Various phospholipase A2 forms are known. They comprise Ca2+-dependent lowmolecular<br>
secretory phospholipases A2 (sPLA2), CA2+-independent highmolecular<br>
phospholipases A2 (iPLA2), CA2+-dependent high-molecular cytosolic<br>
phospholipases A2 (cPLA2) and Ca2+-independent lipoprotein-associated<br>
phospholipases A2 (LP-PLA2), formerly also referred to as PAF acetylhydrolase<br>
(Six era/., Biochim. Biophys. Acta., 2000, 1488, 1-19). According to the current<br>
state of knowledge, the cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) plays the key role in<br>
the biosynthesis of prostaglandins, leukotrienes, PAFs and lysophospholipids.<br>
This was demonstrated inter alia by studies with cPLA2 knock-out mice, i.e. mice<br>
no longer having this enzyme (Uozumi et al., Nature 1997, 390, 618-622;<br>
Bonventre et al., Nature 1997, 390, 622-625, Dennis et al., Journal of<br>
Experimental Medicine 2002, 796,349-357).<br>
Thus, excess stimulation of this enzyme can result in a number of chronic and<br>
acute diseases, such as asthma, cerebral ischemia (Clemens era/., Stroke 1996,<br>
27, 527-535), Alzheimer's disease (Stephenson et al., Neurobiology of Stroke,<br>
1996, 3, 51-63), rheumatoid arthritis (Huang et al., Mediators of Inflammation,<br>
1994, 3, 307-308), chronic skin diseases and damage to the skin caused by U.V.<br>
rays (Gresham et al., American Journal of Physiology 1996, 270, C1037-C1050).<br>
Inhibitors of cPLA2 can thus be useful for a number of inflammatory diseases.<br>
Inhibitors of cytosolic Phospholipase A2 have already been described in the<br>
literature (Lehr, Drugs of the Future, 2000, 25, 823-832).<br>
For example, 1,3-disubstituted propan-2-one compounds of AstraZeneca<br>
company are known (Connolly et al., Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 2002, 45,<br>
1348-1362). WO 00/34254 discloses compounds having an inhibitory effect on<br>
cytosolic phospholipase A2. Patent specifications U.S. 6,414,179, U.S.<br>
2002/0037875 and U.S. 2002/0065246 disclose alpha amino-substituted, thiosubstituted<br>
and oxo-substituted ketones as well as alpha-substituted and betasubstituted<br>
trifluoromethylketones as inhibitors of cytosolic phospholipase A2.<br>
Moreover, EP 976 748 discloses certain pyrrolidine derivatives as inhibitors of<br>
cytosolic Phospholipase A2.<br>
However, there is still a need for novel compounds which inhibit phospholipase<br>

and for preventing and treating allergically induced diseases. The compounds<br>
according to the invention thus represent inter alia effective analgesics,<br>
antiphlogistics, antipyretics, antiallergics and broncholytics and are usable for<br>
thrombosis prophylaxis and for the prophylaxis of anaphylactic shock and for<br>
treating dermatologic diseases such as psoriasis, urticaria, acute and chronic<br>
exanthemas of allergic and non-allergic genesis.<br>
Therefore, the present invention also relates to pharmaceutical preparations<br>
comprising a compound of general formula I or a pharmaceutically compatible<br>
salt or ester thereof.<br>
The compounds of formula I are particularly suited for the production of a<br>
pharmaceutical preparation for preventing or treating diseases which are caused<br>
or contributorily caused by an increased activity of phospholipase A2, preferably<br>
of cytosolic phospholipase A2. These are e.g. diseases selected from<br>
inflammations, pain, fever, allergies, asthma, psoriasis, cerebral ischemia,<br>
Alzheimer's disease, chronic skin diseases, damage to the skin caused by U.V.<br>
radiation, rheumatic diseases, thrombosis, anaphylactic shock, urticuria, acute<br>
and chronic exanthemas and endotoxic shock.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can either be administered as<br>
individual therapeutic substances or as mixtures with other therapeutic active<br>
substances. They can be administered as such but in general they are given as<br>
a pharmaceutical preparation, i.e. as active substance mixtures having suitable<br>
pharmaceutical carriers or diluents. The compounds or preparations can be<br>
administered orally, parenterally, by inhalation, rectally or topically (including<br>
dermally, transdermally, buccally and sublingually).<br>
The kind of pharmaceutical preparation and pharmaceutical carrier or diluent<br>
depends on the desired kind of administration. Oral preparations may be present<br>
as tablets or capsules, for example, also in a retarded form, and may contain<br>
conventional excipients, such as binders (e.g. syrup acacia, gelatin, sorbitol,<br>
tragacanth or polyvinylpyrrolidone), fillers (e.g. lactose, sugar, corn starch,<br>
calcium phosphate, sorbitol or glycine, lubricants (e.g. magnesium stearate,<br>
talcum, polyethylene glycol or silica), disintegrating agents (e.g. starch) or<br>
wetting agents (e.g. sodium lauryl sulfate). Oral liquid preparations may be<br>
present as aqueous or oily suspensions, solutions, emulsions, syrups, elixirs, or<br>
sprays, etc., or may be present as a dry powder for reconstitution with water or<br>
another suitable carrier. Such liquid preparations may contain conventional<br>
additives, e.g. suspending agents, flavoring agents, diluents, or emulsifiers. For<br>
parenteral administration it is possible to use solutions or suspensions with<br>
conventional pharmaceutical carriers. For administration by inhalation the<br>
compounds may be present in a powdery, aqueous or partially aqueous solution<br>
which can be used as an aerosol. Preparations for topical application may be<br>
present e.g. as pharmaceutically compatible powders lotions, ointments, creams,<br>
gels or as therapeutic systems which contain therapeutically active amounts of<br>
the compounds according to the invention.<br>
The necessary dosage depends on the form of pharmaceutical preparation used,<br>
on the kind of application, the severity of the symptoms and the special subject<br>
(human or animal) which is treated. The treatment is usually started with a dose<br>
below the optimum dose. Thereafter, the dose is raised until the optimum effect<br>
for the given conditions is achieved. In general, the compounds according to the<br>
invention are administered the best in concentrations by which effective actions<br>
can be achieved without detrimental or disadvantageous effects occurring. They<br>
can be administered as a single dose or in several doses.<br>
The effectiveness of the compounds according to the invention can be<br>
determined by the inhibition of cytosolic phospholipase A2- To this end, cytosolic<br>
phospholipase A2 is stimulated in intact human thrombocytes with calcium<br>
ionophor A23187 so as to trigger the release of arachidonic acid from the<br>
membrane phospholipids. In order to prevent the metabolization of the enzyme<br>
product arachidonic acid via the cyclooxygenase route and the 12-lipoxygenase<br>
route, the dual cyclooxygenase/12-lipoxygenase-inhibitor 5,8,11,14-<br>
eicosatetraynoic acid is added. Following purification by means of solid phase<br>
extraction, the released arachidonic acid is determined by reversed phase-HPLC<br>
using U.V. detection. The inhibition of the enzyme by a test substance follows<br>
from the ratio of the arachidonic acid amounts formed in the presence or<br>
absence of the test substance. More detailed information on the test system is<br>
made in Example 10.<br>
The present invention also relates to a method of producing a compound of<br>
formula I, wherein a compound of formula II<br>
or a compound of formula III<br>
H<br>
is reacted with a compound of formula IV<br>
and the alcohol formed is oxidized to give the desired ketone, wherein Q, Ar, X,<br>
Y, R2 and R3 are as defined above and Abg stands for a leaving group such as<br>
halogen, in particular bromine.<br>
The below examples explain the invention without limiting it to the concrete<br>
compounds.<br>
All batches were carried out in a nitrogen protective gas atmosphere. Silica gel<br>
60 of Merck company, Darmstadt, Germany, particle size 63 - 200/i/m or 15 - 40<br>
//m (= flash chromatography), was used for the column chromatographic<br>
purification.<br>

absolute dichloromethane is charged under nitrogen and the solution is cooled to<br>
0°C using an ice bath. Thereafter, 5.62 ml (8.99 mmol) of a 1.6 M n-butyllithium<br>
solution are slowly added drop-wise. The reaction mixture is heated to room<br>
temperature, stirred for 1 hour, then admixed with the solution of 1.50 g<br>
(8.56 mmol) methylindole-5-carboxylate in 20 ml absolute dichloromethane and<br>
stirred again at room temperature for one hour. Thereafter, the batch is cooled to<br>
0°C and 1.28 ml (18.1 mmol) acetylchloride is carefully added so as to form an<br>
orange suspension. The latter is stirred at room temperature for 1 hour. Then,<br>
0.93 g (7.02 mmol) aluminum chloride is added. After another hour of stirring at<br>
room temperature, hydrolysis with semi-saturated NaCI solution is carried out<br>
and 100 ml ethyl acetate and 20 ml tetrahydrofurane are added. Three<br>
extractions are carried out using ethyl acetate, the combined organic phases are<br>
washed with saturated NaCI solution and the organic phase is dried on sodium<br>
sulfate. The solvent is distilled off. Chromatographic purification of the residue on<br>

Pharmacological test<br>
The effectiveness of the compounds according to the invention can be<br>
determined by the inhibition of cytosolic phospholipase A2. The test method used<br>
was described earlier (Lehr M. era/., Arch. Pharm. Pharm. Med. Chem. 2000,<br>
333, 312-314). Here, the arachidonic acid formed by cytosolic phospholipase A2<br>
in intact human platelets following stimulation using calcium ionophor A23187 is<br>
detected in the presence and absence of test substances.<br>
The compounds of Examples 2, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 according to the invention were<br>
tested by means of this test system. At a concentration of 10 //M they inhibited<br>
the activity of cytosolic phospholipase A2 by 40% to 95%, which proves their<br>
effectiveness.<br><br><br><br>
