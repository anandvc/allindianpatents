Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to processes for preparing nicotinic compounds<br>
and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, as well as pharmaceutical compositions and<br>
methods for treating a wide variety of conditions and disorders associated with<br>
dysfunction of the central and autonomic nervous systems.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Nicotine has been proposed to have a number of pharmacological effects. See,<br>
for example, Pullan et al, N. Engl. J. Med. 330:811-815 (1994). Certain of those effects<br>
can be related to effects upon neurotransmitter release. Release of acetylcholine,<br>
dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and glutamate upon administration of nicotine has<br>
been reported (Rowell et al, J. Neurochem. 43:1593 (1984); Rapier et al, J. Neurochem.<br>
50:1123 (1988); Sandor et al, Brain Res. 567:313 (1991); Vizi, Br. J. Pharmacol. 47:765<br>
(1973); Hall et al., Biochem. Pharmacol. 21:1829 (1972); Hery et al., Arch. Int.<br>
Pharmacodyn. Ther. 296:91 (1977); and Toth etal, Neurochem Res. 17:265 (1992)).<br>
Confirmatory reports and additional recent studies have included the modulation in the<br>
Central Nervous System (CNS) of glutamate, nitric oxide, GABA, takykinins, cytokines,<br>
and peptides (reviewed in Brioni et al, Adv. Pharmacol. 37:153 (1997)). In addition,<br>
nicotine reportedly potentiates the pharmacological behavior of certain pharmaceutical<br>
compositions used to treat certain disorders. See, for example, Sanberg et al, Pharmacol.<br>
Biochem. &amp; Behavior 46:303 (1993); Harsing et al, J. Neurochem. 59:48 (1993); and<br>
Hughes, Proceedings from Intl. Symp. Nic. S40 (1994). Furthermore, the neuroprotective<br>
effects of nicotine have been proposed, see, for example, Sjak-shie et al, Brain Res.<br>
624:295 (1993). Various other beneficial pharmacological effects have also been<br>
proposed. See, for example, Decina et al, Biol. Psychiatry 28:502 (1990); Wagner et al,<br>
Pharmacopsychiatry 21:301 (1988); Pomerleau et al, Addictive Behaviors 9:265 (1984);<br><br>
Onaivi et al, Life Sci. 54(3):193 (1994); Tripathi et al, J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 221:91<br>
(1982); and Hamon, Trends in Pharmacol. Res. 15:36 (1994).<br>
Various compounds that target nAChRs have been reported as being useful for<br>
treating a wide variety of conditions and disorders. See, for example, Williams et al,<br>
DN&amp;P 7(4):205 (1994); Arneric et al, CNS Drug Rev. 1(1): 1 (1995); Arneric et al, Exp.<br>
Opin. Invest. Drugs 5(1):79 (1996); Bencherif et al, J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 279:1413<br>
(1996); Lippiello et al, J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 279:1422 (1996); Damaj et al, J.<br>
Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 291:390 (1999); Chiari et al, Anesthesiology 91:1447 (1999);<br>
Lavand'homme and Eisenbach, Anesthesiology 91:1455 (1999); Holladay et al, J. Med.<br>
Chem. 40(28): 4169 (1997); Bannon et al, Science 279: 77 (1998); PCT WO 94/08992;<br>

al; 5,597,919 to Dull et al; 5,604,231 to Smith etal; and 5,852,041 to Cosford et al<br>
Nicotinic compounds are reported as being particularly useful for treating a wide variety<br>
of CNS disorders. Indeed, a wide variety of nicotinic compounds have been reported to<br>
have therapeutic properties. See, for example, Bencherif and Schmitt, Current Drug<br>
Targets: CNS and Neurological Disorders 1(4): 349-357 (2002), Levin and Rezvani,<br>
Current Drug Targets: CNS and Neurological Disorders 1(4): 423-431 (2002), O'Neill,<br>
et al, Current Drug Targets: CNS and Neurological Disorders 1(4): 399-411 (2002),<br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 5,1871,166 to Kikuchi et al, 5,672,601 to Cignarella, PCT WO<br>
99/21834 and PCT WO 97/40049, UK Patent Application GB 2295387 and European<br>
Patent Application 297,858.<br>
CNS disorders are a type of neurological disorder. CNS disorders can be drug-<br>
induced; can be attributed to genetic predisposition, infection or trauma; or can be of<br>
unknown etiology. CNS disorders comprise neuropsychiatric disorders, neurological<br>
diseases, and mental illnesses, and include neurodegenerative diseases, behavioral<br>
disorders, cognitive disorders, and cognitive affective disorders. There are several CNS<br>
disorders whose clinical manifestations have been attributed to CNS dysfunction {i.e.,<br>
disorders resulting from inappropriate levels of neurotransmitter release, inappropriate<br>
properties of neurotransmitter receptors, and/or inappropriate interaction between<br>
neurotransmitters and neurotransmitter receptors). Several CNS disorders can be<br>
attributed to a deficiency of acetylcholine, dopamine, norepinephrine, and/or serotonin.<br><br>
Relatively common CNS disorders include pre-senile dementia (early-onset<br>
Alzheimer's disease), senile dementia (dementia of the Alzheimer's type), micro-infarct<br>
dementia, AIDS-related dementia, vascular dementia, Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, Pick's<br>
disease, Parkinsonism including Parkinson's disease, Lewy body dementia, progressive<br>
supranuclear palsy, Huntington's chorea, tardive dyskinesia, hyperkinesia, epilepsy,<br>
mania, attention deficit disorder, anxiety, dyslexia, schizophrenia, depression, obsessive-<br>
compulsive disorders, and Tourette's syndrome.<br>
Subtypes of nAChRs are present in both the central and peripheral nervous<br>
systems, but the distribution of subtypes is heterogeneous. For instance, the subtypes<br>
which are predominant in vertebrate brain are α4β2, a7, and α3β2, whereas those which<br>
predominate at the autonomic ganglia are α3β4 and those of neuromuscular junction are<br>
α1β1δγ and α1β1δε (see for instance Dwoskin et ah, Exp. Opin. Then Patents 10:1561<br>
(2000); and Schmitt and Bencherif, Annual Reports in Med Chem. 35: 41 (2000)).<br>
A limitation of some nicotinic compounds is that they elicit various<br>
undesirable pharmacological effects because of their interaction with nAChRs in<br>
peripheral tissues (for example, by stimulating muscle and ganglionic nAChR subtypes).<br>
It is therefore desirable to have compounds, compositions, and methods for preventing<br>
and/or treating various conditions or disorders (e.g., CNS disorders), including alleviating<br>
the symptoms of these disorders, where the compounds exhibit nicotinic pharmacology<br>
with a beneficial effect on the CNS nAChRs (e.g., upon the functioning of the CNS), but<br>
without significant associated effects on the peripheral nAChRs (compounds specific for<br>
CNS nAChRs). It is also highly desirable to have compounds, compositions, and methods<br>
that affect CNS function without significantly affecting those receptor subtypes which<br>
have the potential to induce undesirable side effects (e.g., appreciable activity at<br>
cardiovascular and skeletal muscle sites).<br>
Methods for treating and/or preventing the above-described conditions and<br>
disorders by administering E-metanicotine compounds, particularly those which maximize<br>
the effect on CNS function without significantly affecting those receptor subtypes which<br>
have the potential to induce undesirable side effects, have been described in the art.<br>
Representative E-metanicotine compounds for use in treating and/or preventing the above-<br>
described disorders are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,212,188 to Caldwell et<br>
al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,604,231 to Smith et al, U.S. Pat. No. 5,616,707 to Crooks et al; U.S.<br><br><br>
5,726,316 to Crooks et al, U.S. Pat. No. 5,811,442 to Bencherif et al, U.S. Pat. No.<br>
5,861,423 to Caldwell et al, PCT WO 97/40011; PCT WO 99/65876 PCT WO<br>
00/007600; and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/391,747, filed on Sep. 8,1999, the<br>
contents of each of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
The syntheses described in the art for forming E-metanicotines typically<br>
involve performing a Heck reaction between a halogenated heteroaryl ring, such as a halo-<br>
pyridine or halo-pyrimidine, and a double bond-containing compound. The double bond-<br>
containing compound typically includes either a hydroxy group, which is converted to an<br>
amine group to form the E-metanicotine, or includes a protected amine group, which is<br>
deprotected following the Heck reaction to form the E-metanicotine. A limitation of the<br>
Heck coupling chemistry is that, while the major reaction product is the desired E-<br>
metanicotine, there are minor reaction products, including the Z-metanicotine, a<br>
metanicotine compound where the double bond has migrated from the position adjacent to<br>
the heteroaryl (such as pyridine or pyrimidine) ring (i.e., a non-conjugated double bond),<br>
and a compound in which the heteroaryl group is attached at the secondary (as opposed to<br>
primary) alkene carbon (i.e., a methylene compound or "exo" double bond). It can be<br>
difficult to remove these minor reaction products, particularly on scale-up.<br>
It would be advantageous to provide new methods of preparing purified E-<br>
metanicotine compounds substantially free from the above-described minor reaction<br>
products. It would also be advantageous to provide new salt forms of these drugs to<br>
improve their bioavailability, and/or to assist in preparing large quantities of these<br>
compounds in a commercially reasonable manner. The present invention provides such<br>
new synthesis methods and new salt forms.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
New methods of synthesizing E-metanicotine compounds are described herein,<br>
as well as new pharmaceutically acceptable salt forms of E-metanicotine compounds.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions including the new salt forms, and methods of treatment<br>
 and/or prevention using the new salt forms, are also disclosed.<br>
The methods for synthesizing the E-metanicotine compounds typically include<br>
the step of performing a Heck reaction between a halogenated heteroaryl ring, such as a<br><br>
halo-pyridine or halo-pyrimidine, and a double bond-containing compound. The double<br>
bond-containing compound typically includes either a hydroxy group, which is<br>
subsequently converted to an amine group to form the E-metanicotine compound, or<br>
includes a protected amine group, which is deprotected following the Heck reaction to<br>
form the E-metanicotine compound.<br>
After the Heck reaction and formation of an E-metanicotine with a free amine<br>
group (whether by conversion of a hydroxy group or deprotection of a protected amine<br>
group), the next step involves forming a hydroxybenzoate salt of the E-metanicotine<br>
compound. Under certain conditions, one can precipitate out the hydroxybenzoate salt of<br>
the E-metanicotine compound while leaving the minor impurities (Z-metanicotine and/or<br>
the isomers of the E-metanicotine compound wherein the double bond has migrated to a<br>
position other than directly adjacent to the heteroaryl ring or wherein the attachment of the<br>
aryl group to the alkene chain is at the secondary double bond carbon) in solution. This<br>
improvement makes it relatively easy to remove these minor reaction products,<br>
particularly on scale-up.<br>
In one embodiment, the synthesis of the E-metanicotines involves forming an<br>
amine-protected 4-penten-2-amine intermediate, and coupling this intermediate via a Heck<br>
reaction with a halogenated heteroaryl ring. The choice of heteroaryl ring is not essential<br>
to the success of the Heck coupling reaction, although pyridine and pyrimidine rings can<br>
be preferred. (2S)-(4E)-N-methyI-5-[3-(5-isopropoxypyridin)yl)]-4-penten-2-amine is a<br>
representative E-metanicotine, p-hydroxybenzoate is a representative hydroxybenzoate<br>
salt, and (2S)-(4E)-N-methyl-5-[3-(5-isopropoxypyridin)yl)]-4-penten-2-amine p-<br>
hydroxybenzoate is a representative E-metanicotine hydroxybenzoate salt.<br>
An exemplary reaction is shown below:<br>
Cy-Hal + CH2=CH-CH2CH(CH3)N(CH3XtBoc) →<br>
(E) Cy-CH=CH-CH2CH(CH3)N(CH3)(tBoc)<br>
+ (Z) Cy-CH=CH-CH2CH(CH3)N(CH3)(tBoc)<br>
+ (E and/or Z) Cy-CH2CH=CHCH(CH3)N(CH3)(tBoc)<br>
+ Cy-C(=CH2)-CH2CH(CH3)N(CH3)(tBoc)<br>
where Cy is a five or six membered heteroaryl ring.<br>
In another embodiment, the Heck coupling reaction takes place using a<br>
hydroxy-alkene, such as 4-penten-2-ol, and the hydroxy group is converted to an amine<br><br>
group after the Heck coupling reaction takes place. The conversion can be effected, for<br>
example, by converting the hydroxy group to a tosylate, and displacing the tosylate with a<br>
suitable amine, such as methylamine. In this embodiment, the Heck coupling reaction still<br>
forms the same major and minor products, except that they include a hydroxy group rather<br>
than a protected amine group. Following formation of the amine-containing compound<br>
(i.e., the (E)-metanicotine), if the impurities (i.e., the minor products of the Heck coupling<br>
reaction) are not already removed, the chemistry involved in forming the hydroxybenzoate<br>
salts is substantially the same.<br>
After deprotecting the amine group (in the first embodiment), or forming the<br>
amine group (in the second embodiment), one can form a hydroxybenzoate salt of the E-<br>
metanicotine by reaction with a hydroxybenzoic acid as described herein. The<br>
hydroxybenzoate salts of the major product (the (E)-metanicotine) and of the minor<br>
products will form. However, under certain conditions, the hydroxybenzoate salt of the<br>
major reaction product, the (E)-metanicotine hydroxybenzoate salt, will precipitate out of<br>
solution in relatively pure form, leaving behind a mother liquor enriched in the minor<br>
impurities. This result comprises a significant advance in the synthesis and purification of<br>
(E)-metanicotines.<br>
In one embodiment, the hydroxybenzoate salts are isolated and then used as<br>
intermediates to form different salt forms by reaction with different pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable acids or salts thereof. However, in another embodiment, the E-metanicotine<br>
hydroxybenzoate salts are used as active pharmaceutical ingredients (API's). The<br>
hydroxybenzoate salts can be used directly, or included in pharmaceutical compositions<br>
by combining them with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. The hydroxybenzoate<br>
salts and/or pharmaceutical compositions can be used to treat and/or prevent a wide<br>
variety of conditions or disorders. The disorders are particularly those disorders<br>
characterized by dysfunction of nicotinic cholinergic neurotransmission, including<br>
disorders involving neuromodulation of neurotransmitter release, such as dopamine<br>
release. The compounds can be used in methods for treatment and/or prophylaxis of<br>
disorders, such as central nervous system (CNS) disorders, which are characterized by an<br>
alteration in normal neurotransmitter release. The compounds can also be used to treat<br>
certain conditions (e.g., a method for alleviating pain). The methods involve administering<br>
to a subject an effective amount of a E-metanicotine hydroxybenzoate salt, or<br><br>
pharmaceutical composition including a E-metanicotine hydroxybenzoate salt, as<br>
described herein.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions, when employed in effective amounts, can<br>
interact with relevant nicotinic receptor sites in a patient, and act as therapeutic and/or<br>
prophylactic agents in connection with a wide variety of conditions and disorders,<br>
particularly CNS disorders characterized by an alteration in normal neurotransmitter<br>
release. The pharmaceutical compositions can provide therapeutic benefit to individuals<br>
suffering from such disorders and exhibiting clinical manifestations of such disorders in<br>
that the compounds within those compositions, when employed in effective amounts, can<br>
(i) exhibit nicotinic pharmacology and affect relevant nicotinic receptors sites (e.g.,<br>
activate nicotinic receptors), and (ii) modulate neurotransmitter secretion, and hence<br>
prevent and suppress the symptoms associated with those disorders. In addition, the<br>
compounds can (i) increase the number of nicotinic cholinergic receptors of the brain of<br>
the patient, (ii) exhibit neuroprotective effects and (iii) when employed in effective<br>
amounts can exhibit relatively low levels of adverse side effects (e.g., significant increases<br>
in blood pressure and heart rate, significant negative effects upon the gastro-intestinal<br>
tract, and significant effects upon skeletal muscle).<br>
The foregoing and other aspects of the present invention are explained in detail<br>
in the detailed description and examples set forth below.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The hydroxybenzoate salts described herein, which are derived from E-<br>
metanicotines and hydroxybenzoic acids, have a number of advantages over other salts<br>
derived from E-metanicotines and other acids. In general, the hydroxybenzoic acid salts of<br>
E-metanicotines are water-soluble materials that tend to be highly crystalline and less<br>
hygroscopic in nature than other salts. For example, the p-hydroxybenzoate salt of (2S)-<br>
(4E)-N-methyl-5-[3-(5-isopropoxypyridin)yl)]-4-penten-2-amine is physically and<br>
chemically stable, free-flowing, crystalline powder. Such properties are definite<br>
advantages for pharmaceutical formulation development and pharmaceutical<br>
manufacturing. If necessary, this salt can be milled to an acceptable particle size range for<br>
pharmaceutical processing. The salt is compatible with a wide range of excipients that<br>
might be chosen for the manufacture of solid oral dosage forms. This is especially so for<br><br>
those exicipients, such as polysaccharide derivatives, that are pharmaceutically defined<br>
hydrates and those with only loosely bound surface water. As an illustration, salts derived<br>
from certain E-metanicotines, such as E-metanicotine and fumaric acid are prone to the<br>
formation of impurities within the salt. For example, impurities arise from the Michael<br>
addition reaction of the secondary amine in E-metanicotine to the olefin in fumaric acid.<br>
These impurities lower the chemical purity of the salt and adversely affect the chemical<br>
integrity of the salt upon long-term storage.<br>

As used herein, an "agonist" is a substance that stimulates its binding partner,<br>
typically a receptor. Stimulation is defined in the context of the particular assay, or may<br>
be apparent in the literature from a discussion herein that makes a comparison to a factor<br>
or substance that is accepted as an "agonist" or an "antagonist" of the particular binding<br>
partner under substantially similar circumstances as appreciated by those of skill in the art.<br>
Stimulation may be defined with respect to an increase in a particular effect or function<br>
that is induced by interaction of the agonist or partial agonist with a binding partner and<br>
can include allosteric effects.<br>
As used herein, an "antagonist" is a substance that inhibits its binding partner,<br>
typically a receptor. Inhibition is defined in the context of the particular assay, or may be<br>
apparent in the literature from a discussion herein that makes a comparison to a factor or<br>
substance that is accepted as an "agonist" or an "antagonist" of the particular binding<br>
partner under substantially similar circumstances as appreciated by those of skill in the art.<br>
Inhibition may be defined with respect to a decrease in a particular effect or function that<br><br>
is induced by interaction of the antagonist with a binding partner, and can include<br>
allosteric effects.<br>
As used herein, a "partial agonist" is a substance that provides a level of<br>
stimulation to its binding partner that is intermediate between that of a full or complete<br>
antagonist and an agonist defined by any accepted standard for agonist activity. It will be<br>
recognized that stimulation, and hence, inhibition is defined intrinsically for any substance<br>
or category of substances to be defined as agonists, antagonists, or partial agonists. As<br>
used herein, "intrinsic activity", or "efficacy," relates to some measure of biological<br>
effectiveness of the binding partner complex. With regard to receptor pharmacology, the<br>
context in which intrinsic activity or efficacy should be defined will depend on the context<br>
of the binding partner (e.g., receptor/ligand) complex and the consideration of an activity<br>
relevant to a particular biological outcome. For example, in some circumstances, intrinsic<br>
activity may vary depending on the particular second messenger system involved. See<br>
Hoyer, D. and Boddeke, H., Trends Pharmacol Sci. 14(7):270-5 (1993). Where such<br>
contextually specific evaluations are relevant, and how they might be relevant in the<br>
context of the present invention, will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>

and<br>
both E groups on the double bond are preferably hydrogen, and<br>
m is is 1,2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.<br>
In one embodiment, all of E and E' are hydrogen, and in another embodiment,<br>
at least one of E or E' is alkyl and the remaining E and E' are hydrogen. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, E' is an alkyl group, preferably a methyl group.<br>
Isomers, mixtures, including racemic mixtures, enantiomers, diastereomers<br>
and tautomers of these compounds, as well as pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof,<br>

bonded to oxygen (e.g., an N-oxide or N-O functionality), or carbon bonded to H or a<br><br>
non-nyarogen substituent species. No more than three of X, X', X", X"', and X"" are<br>
nitrogen or nitrogen bonded to oxygen, and it is preferred that only one or two of X, X',<br>
X", X'", and X"" are nitrogen or nitrogen bonded to oxygen. In addition, it is highly<br>
preferred that not more than one of X, X', X", X"', and X"" is nitrogen bonded to oxygen;<br>
and it is preferred that if one of those species is nitrogen bonded to oxygen, that species is<br>
X'". Most preferably, X"' is nitrogen. In certain preferred circumstances, both X' and X'"<br>
are nitrogen. Typically, X, X", and X"" are carbon bonded to a substituent species, and it<br>
is typical that the substituent species at X, X", and X"" are hydrogen. For certain other<br>

carbon bonded to a substituent species such as hydrogen, X and X"' are both nitrogen.<br>
Suitable non-hydrogen substituent species are as defined above with respect to<br>
Z.<br>
In another embodiment, Cy is a 5-membered ring heteroaryl of the following<br>
formula:<br><br>
where Y and Y" are individually nitrogen, nitrogen bonded to a substituent<br>
species, oxygen, sulfur or carbon bonded to a substituent species, and Y' and Y"' are<br>
nitrogen or carbon bonded to a substituent species. The dashed lines indicate that the<br>
bonds (between Y and Y' and between Y' and Y") can be either single or double bonds.<br>
However, when the bond between Y and Y' is a single bond, the bond between Y' and Y"<br>
must be a double bond and vice versa. In cases in which Y or Y" is oxygen or sulfur, only<br>
one of Y and Y" is either oxygen or sulfur. At least one of Y, Y', Y", and Y'" must be<br>
oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen, or nitrogen bonded to a substituent species. It is preferred that<br>
no more than three of Y, Y', Y", and Y"' be oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen, or nitrogen bonded to<br>

carbocyclic or heterocyclic rings containing, but not limited to, ether, acetal, ketal, amine,<br>
ketone, lactone, lactam, carbamate, or urea functionalities.<br>
Depending upon the identity and positioning of each individual E and E',<br>
certain compounds can be optically active (e.g., the compound can have one or more<br>
chiral centers, with R or S configurations). The present invention relates to racemic<br>
mixtures of such compounds as well as single enantiomer compounds.<br>
Of particular interest are aryl substituted amine compounds of the formula:<br><br>
where X', E, E', Z', Z", and m are as defined hereinbefore, and A, A', and A"<br>

II. Compound Preparation<br>
The manner in which the (E)-metanicotine-type compounds described herein are<br>
synthetically produced can vary. For example, the compounds can be prepared by the<br>
palladium-catalyzed coupling reaction of an aromatic halide and a terminal olefin containing<br>
a protected amine substituent, removal of the protective group to obtain a primary or<br>
secondary amine, and optional alkylation to provide a secondary or tertiary amine. In<br>
particular, certain metanicotine-type compounds can be prepared by subjecting a 3-halo-<br><br>
substituted, optionally 5-substituted, pyridine compound or a 5-halo-substituted pyrimidine<br>
compound to a palladium-catalyzed coupling reaction using an olefin possessing a protected<br>
amine functionality (e.g., such an olefin provided by the reaction of a phthalimide salt with 3-<br>
halo-1-propene, 4-halo-l-butene, 5-halo-l-pentene or 6-halo-l-hexene). See, Frank et al, J.<br>
Org. Chem., 43(15):2947-2949 (1978); and Malek et al, J. Org. Chem., 47:5395-5397<br>
(1982).<br>
In another embodiment, the compounds are synthesized by condensing an olefinic<br>
alcohol, such as 4-penten-2-ol, with an aromatic halide, such as 3-bromopyridine or 3-<br>
iodopyridine. Typically, the types of procedures set forth in Frank et al, J. Org. Chem., 43:<br>
2947-2949 (1978) and Malek et al, J. Org. Chem., 47: 5395-5397 (1982) involving a<br>
palladium-catalyzed coupling of an olefin and an aromatic halide are used. The olefinic<br>
alcohol optionally can be protected as a t-butyldimethylsilyl ether prior to the coupling.<br>
Desilylation then produces the olefinic alcohol. The alcohol condensation product then is<br>
converted to an amine using the type of procedures set forth in deCosta et al, J. Org. Client.,<br>
35: 4334-4343 (1992). Typically, the alcohol condensation product is converted to the aryl<br>
substituted olefinic amine by activation of the alcohol using methanesulfonyl chloride or p-<br>
toluenesulfonyl chloride, followed by mesylate or tosylate displacement using ammonia, or a<br>
primary or secondary amine. Thus, when the amine is ammonia, an aryl substituted olefinic<br>
primary amine compound is provided; when the amine is a primary amine such as<br>
methylamine or cyclobutylamine, an aryl substituted olefinic secondary amine compound is<br>
provided; and when the amine is a secondary amine such as dimethylamine or pyrrolidine, an<br>
aryl substituted olefinic tertiary amine compound is provided. Other representative olefinic<br>
alcohols include 4-penten-l-ol, 5-hexen-2-ol, 5-hexen-3-ol, 3-methyl-3-buten-l-ol, 2-methyl-<br>
3-buten-l-ol, 4-methyl-4-penten-l-ol, 4-methyl-4-penten-2-ol, l-octen-4-ol, 5-methyl-l-<br>
hepten-4-ol, 4-methyl-5-hexen-2-ol, 5-methyl-5-hexen-2-ol, 5-hexen-2-ol and 5-methyl-5-<br>
hexen-3-ol. Trifluormethyl-substituted olefinic alcohols, such as l,l,l-trifluoro-4-penten-2-ol,<br>
can be prepared from l-ethoxy-2,2,2-trifluoro-ethanol and allyltrimethylsilane using the<br>
procedures of Kubota et al, Tetrahedron Letters, 33(10):135M354 (1992), or from<br>
trifluoroacetic acid ethyl ester and allyltributylstannane using the procedures of Ishihara et al,<br>
Tetrahedron Letters, 34(56): 5777-5780 (1993). Certain olefinic alcohols are optically active,<br>
and can be used as enantiomeric mixtures or as pure enantiomers in order to provide the<br>
corresponding optically active forms of aryl substituted olefinic amine compounds. When an<br>
olefinic allylic alcohol, such as methallyl alcohol, is reacted with an aromatic halide, an aryl<br><br><br>
aryl substituted olefinic amine compound by reductive amination (e.g., by treatment using an<br>
alkyl amine and sodium cyanoborohydride). Preferred aromatic halides are 3-bromopyridine-<br>
type compounds and 3-iodopyridine-type compounds. Typically, substituent groups of such 3-<br>
halopyridine-type compounds are such that those groups can survive contact with those<br>
chemicals (e.g., tosylchloride and methylamine) and the reaction conditions experienced<br>
during the preparation of the aryl substituted olefinic amine compound. Alternatively,<br>
substituents such as -OH, -NH2 and -SH can be protected as corresponding acyl compounds,<br>
or substituents such as -NH2 can be protected as a phthalimide functionality. In the case of a .<br>
dihaloaromatic, sequential palladium-catalyzed (Heck-type) couplings to two different<br>
olefinic side chains are possible.<br>
In one embodiment, the (E)-metanicotine-rype compounds possess a branched side<br>
chain, such as (4E)-N-methyi-5-(5-isopropoxy-3-pyridinyl)-4-penten-2-amine. By using one<br>
synthetic approach, the latter compound can be synthesized in a convergent manner, in which<br>
the side chain, N-methyl-N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-4-penten-2-amine is coupled with the 3-<br>
substituted 5-halo-substituted pyridine, 5-bromo-3-isopropoxypyridine, under Heck reaction<br>
conditions, followed by removal of the tert-butoxycarbonyl protecting group. Typically, the<br>
types of procedures set forth in W. C. Frank et al, J. Org. Chem. 43:2947 (1978) and N. J.<br>
Malek et al., J. Org. Chem. 47:5395 (1982) involving a palladium-catalyzed coupling of an<br>
olefin and an aromatic halide are used. The required N-methyl-N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-4-<br>
penten-2-amine can be synthesized as follows: (i) commercially available 4-penten-2-ol<br>
(Aldrich Chemical Company, Lancaster Synthesis Inc.) can be treated with p-toluenesulfonyl<br>
chloride in pyridine to yield 4-penten-2-ol p-toluenesulfonate, previously described by T.<br>
Michel, et al, LiebigsAnn. 11:1811 (1996); (ii) the resulting tosylate can be heated with<br>
excess methylamine to yield N-methyl-4-penten-2-amine; (iii) the resulting amine, such as<br>
previously mentioned by A. Viola et al.,J. Chem. Soc, Chem. Commun. 21: 1429 (1984), can<br>
be allowed to react with 1.2 molar equivalents of di-tert-butyl dicarbonate in dry<br>
tetrahydrofuran to yield the side chain, N-methyl-N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-4-penten-2-amine.<br>
The halo-substituted pyridine (e.g., 5-bromo-3-isopropoxypyridine), can be synthesized by at<br>
least two different routes. In one preparation, 3,5-dibromopyridine is heated at 140° C for 14<br>
hours with 2 molar equivalents of potassium isopropoxide in dry isopropanol in the presence<br>
of copper powder (5%, w/w of the 3,5-dibromopyridine) in a sealed glass tube to yield 5-<br>
bromo-3-isopropoxypyridine. A second preparation of 5-bromo-3-isopropoxypyridine from 5-<br><br>
bromonicotinic acid can be performed as follows: (i) 5-Bromonicotinic acid is converted to 5-<br>
bromonicotinamide by treatment with thionyl chloride, followed by reaction of the<br>
intermediate acid chloride with aqueous ammonia, (ii) The resulting 5-bromonicotinamide,<br>
previously described by C. V. Greco et al, J. Heteocyclic Chem. 7(4):761 (1970), is subjected<br>
to Hofinann degradation by treatment with sodium hydroxide and a 70% solution of calcium<br>
hypochlorite, (iii) The resulting 3-ammo-5-bromopyridine, previously described by C. V.<br>
Greco et al, J. Heteocyclic Chem. 7(4): 761 (1970), can be converted to S-bromo-3-<br>
isopropoxypyridine by diazotization with isoamyl nitrite under acidic conditions, followed by<br>
treatment of the intermediate diazonium salt with isopropanol to yield 5-bromo-3-<br>
isopropoxypyridine. The palladium-catalyzed coupling of 5-bromo-3-isopropoxypyridine and<br>
N-methyl-N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-4-penten-2-amine is carried out in acetonitrile-<br>
triethylamine (2:1, v,v) using a catalyst consisting of 1 mole % palladium(Il) acetate and 4<br>
mole % tri-o-tolylphosphine. The reaction can be carried out by heating the components at<br>
80° C for 20 hours to yield (4E)-N-methyl-N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-5-(5-isopropoxy-3-<br>
pyridinyl)-4-penten- 2-amine. Removal of the tert-butoxycarbonyl protecting group can be<br>
accomplished by treatment with 30 molar equivalents of trifluoroacetic acid in anisole at 0° C<br>
to afford (4E)-N-methyl-5-(5-isopropoxy-3-pyridinyl)-4-penten-2-amine. A variety of N-<br>
methyl-5-(5-alkoxy or 5-aryloxy-3-pyridinyl)-4-penten-2-amines are available from 3,5-<br>
dibromopyridine using this type of technology (i.e., treatment with sodium or potassium<br>
alkoxides or aryloxides and subsequent Heck coupling and deprotection).<br>
In another embodiment, a compound such as (4E)-N-methyl-5-(5-methoxy-3-<br>
pyridinyl)-4-penten-2-amine can be synthesized by coupling a halo-substituted pyridine, 5-<br>
bromo-3-methoxypyridine with an olefin containing a secondary alcohol functionality, 4-<br>
penten-2-ol, under Heck reaction conditions; and the resulting pyridinyl alcohol intermediate<br>
can be converted to its p-toluenesulfonate ester, followed by treatment with methylamine.<br>
Typically, the types of procedures set forth in W. C. Frank et al, J. Org. Chem. 43:2947<br>
(1978) and N. J. Malek et al, /. Org. Chem. 47:5395 (1982) involving a palladium-catalyzed<br>
coupling of an olefin and an aromatic halide are used. The halo-substituted pyridine, 5-<br>
bromo-3-methoxypyridine is synthesized using methodology similar to that described by H. J.<br>
den Hertog et al, Reel. Trav. Chim. Pays-Bas 67:377 (1948), namely by heating 3,5-<br>
dibromopyridine with 2.5 molar equivalents of sodium methoxide in dry methanol in the<br>
presence of copper powder (5%, w/w of the 3,5-dibromopyridine) in a sealed glass tube at<br>
150° C for 14 hours to produce 5-bromo-3-methoxypyridine. The resulting 5-bromo-3-<br><br><br>
can be coupled with 4-penten-2-ol in acetonitrile-triethylamine (1:1:1, v/v) using a catalyst<br>
consisting of 1 mole % palladium(II) acetate and 4 mole % tri-o-tolylphosphine. The reaction<br>
is carried out by heating the components in a sealed glass tube at 140° C for 14 hours to yield<br>
(4E)-N-methyl-5-(5-methoxy-3-pyridinyl)-4-penten-2-ol. The resulting alcohol is treated with<br>
2 molar equivalents of p-toluenesulfonyl chloride in dry pyridine at 0°C to produce (4E)-N-<br>
methyl-5-(5-methoxy-3-pyridinyl)-4-penten-2-ol p-toluensulfonate. The tosylate intermediate<br>
is treated with 120-molar equivalents of methylamine as a 40% aqueous solution, containing<br>
a small amount of ethanol as a co-solvent to produce (4E)-N-methyl-5-(5-methoxy-3-<br>
pyridinyl)-4-penten-2-amine. When 3,5-dibromopyridine is submitted to Heck coupling with<br>
N-methyl-N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-4-penten-2-amine, under conditions described above, N-<br>
methyl-N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-5-(5-bromo-3-pyridinyl)-4-penten-2-amine is produced. This<br>
can be coupled in a subsequent Heck reaction with styrene and deprotected (removal of the<br>
tert-butoxycarbonyl group), as described previously, to give (4E)-N-methyl-5-[3-(5-trans-<br>
beta-styrylpyridin)yl]-4-penten-2-amine. Similar second coupling with ethynylbenzene, and<br>
subsequent deprotection, will give (4E)-N-methyl-5-[3-(5-phenylethynylpyridin)yl]-4-penten-<br>
2-amine.<br>
Optically active forms of certain aryl substituted olefinic amine compounds, such as<br>
(2S)-(4E)-N-methyl-5-(3-pyridinyl)-4-penten-2-amine, can be provided. In one synthetic<br>
approach, the latter type of compound is synthesized by coupling a halo-substituted pyridine,<br>
3-bromopyridine, with an olefin possessing a chiral, secondary alcohol functionality, (2R)-4-<br>
penten-2-ol, under Heck reaction conditions. The resulting chiral pyridinyl alcohol<br>
intermediate, (2R)-(4E)-5-(3-pyridinyl)-4-penten-2-oI is converted to its corresponding p-<br>
toluenesulfonate ester, which is subsequently treated with methylamine, resulting in tosylate<br>
displacement with inversion of configuration. Typically, the types of procedures set forth in<br>
W. C. Frank etal, J. Org. Chem. 43:2947 (1978) and N. J. Malek et al, J. Org. Chem. 47:<br>
5395 (1982) involving a palladium-catalyzed coupling of an aromatic halide and an olefin are<br>
used. The chiral side chain, (2R)-4-penten-2-ol can be prepared by treatment of the chiral<br>
epoxide, (R)-(+)-propylene oxide (commercially available from Fluka Chemical Company)<br>
with vinylmagnesium bromide and copper(I) iodide in tetrahydrofuran at low temperatures (-<br>
25 to -10° C) using the general synthetic methodology of A. Kalivretenos, J. K. Stille, and L.<br>
S. Hegedus, J. Org. Chem. 56:2883 (1991), to afford (2R)-4-penten-2-ol. The resulting chiral<br>
alcohol is subjected to a Heck reaction with 3-bromopyridine in acetonitrile-triethylamine<br><br>
(1:1, v/v) using a catalyst consisting of 1 mole % palladium(II) acetate and 4 mole % tri-o-<br>
tolylphosphine. The reaction is done by heating the components at 140° C for 14 hours in a<br>
 sealed glass tube, to produce the Heck reaction product, (2R)-(4E)-5-(3-pyridinyl)-4-penten-<br>
2-ol. The resulting chiral pyridinyl alcohol is treated with 3 molar equivalents of p-<br>
toluenesulfonyl chloride in dry pyridine at 0° C, to afford the tosylate intermediate. The p-<br>
toluenesulfonate ester is heated with 82 molar equivalents of methylamine as a 40% aqueous<br>
solution, containing a small amount of ethanol as a co-solvent, to produce (2S)-(4E)-N-<br>
methyl-5-(3-pyridinyl)-4-penten-2-amine.<br>
In a similar manner, the corresponding aryl substituted olefinic amine enantiomer,<br>
such as (2R)-(4E)-N-methyl-5-(3-pyridmyl)-4-penten-2-amine, can be synthesized by the<br>
Heck coupling of 3-bromopyridine and (2S)-4-penten-2-ol. The resulting intermediate, (2S)-<br>
(4E)-5-(3-pyridinyl)-4-penten-2-ol, is converted to its p-tpluenesulfonate, which is subjected<br>
to methylamine displacement. The chiral alcohol, (2S)-4-penten-2-oI, is prepared from (S)-(-<br>
)-propylene oxide (commercially available from Aldrich Chemical Company) using a<br>
procedure analogous to that described for the preparation of (2R)-4-penten-2-ol from (R)-(+)-<br>
propylene oxide as reported by A. Kalivretenos, J. K. Stille, and L. S. Hegedus, J. Org. Chem.<br>
 56:2883 (1991).<br>
In another approach, such compounds as (3E)-N-methyl-4-(3-(6-aminopyridin)yl)-3-<br>
buten-1-amine can be prepared by subjecting a 3-halo-substituted pyridine such as 2-amino-5-<br>
bromopyridine (Aldrich Chemical Company) to a palladium-catalyzed coupling reaction with<br>
an olefin possessing a protected amine functionality, such as N-methyI-N-(3-buten-l-<br>
yl)benzamide. The benzoyl-protecting group from the resulting Heck reaction product can be<br>
removed by heating with aqueous acid to give (3E)-N-methyl-4-(3-(6-aminopyridin)yl)-3-<br>
buten-1 -amine. The olefinic starting material, N-methyl-N-(3-buten-l-yl)benzamide, can be<br>
prepared by reacting 4-bromo-l-butene with an excess of condensed methylamine in N,N-<br>
dimethylformamide in the presence of potassium carbonate to give N-methyl-3-buten-l-<br>
amine. Treatment of the latter compound with benzoyl chloride in dichloromethane<br>
containing triethylamine affords the olefinic side chain, N-methyl-N-(3-buten-l-yl)<br>
benzamide.	<br>
The compounds described herein can contain a pyrazine or pyridazine ring. Using<br>
procedures reported M. Hasegawa, etal. (European Patent No. 0 516 409 Bl), 2-<br>
methylpyrazine or 3-methylpyridazine (both available from Aldrich Chemical Company) can<br>
be condensed with N-methyl-N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-3-aminobutanal to give (4E)-N-methyl-<br><br>
N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-5-(2-pyrazinyl)-4-penten-2-amine and(4E)-N-methyl-N-(tert-<br>
butoxycarbonyl)-5-(3-pyridazinyl)-4-penten-2-amine, respectively. Removal of the tert-<br>
butoxycarbonyl group with trifluoroacetic acid will produce (4E)-N-methyl-5-(2-pyrazinyl)-4-<br>
penten-2-amine and (4E)-N-methyl-5-(3-pyridazinyl)-4-penten-2-amine, respectively. The<br>
requisite N-methyl-N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-3-aminobutanal can be produced from the<br>
corresponding alcohol using techniques described by M. Adamczyk and Y. Y. Chen in PCT<br>
 International Application WO 9212122. The alcohol, N-methyl-N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-3-<br>
amino-1-butanol, can be made from commercially available 4-hydroxy-2-butanone (Lancaster<br>
Synthesis, Inc.) by sequential reductive amination (with methylamine and sodium<br>
cyanoborohydride, using chemistry reported by R. F. Borch in Org. Syn., 52:124 (] 974)) and<br>
protection with di-tert-butyl dicarbonate.<br>
The Heck coupling reaction described above is also useful in preparing compounds<br>
that possess certain fused-ring heterocycles. Such compounds can be synthesized by the<br>
palladium-catalyzed coupling of a bromo heterocyclic compound, such as 6-bromo-2-methyl-<br>
1H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine with the previously mentioned olefinic amine side chain, N-<br>
methyl-N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-4-penten-2-amine. Typically, the types of procedures set<br>
forth in W. C. Frank et al, J. Org. Chem. 43:2947 (1978) and N. J. Malek et al., J. Org.<br>
Chem. 47:5395 (1982) involving a palladium-catalyzed coupling of an olefin and an aromatic<br>
halide are used for the coupling reaction. The resulting tert-butoxycarbonyl-protected (Boc-<br>
protected) intermediate can be subjected to treatment with a strong acid, such as<br>
trifluoroacetic acid to produce (4E)-N-methyl-5-(6-(2-methyl-lH-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridin)yI)-<br>
4-penten-2-amine. The requisite bromo-imidazopyridine, 6-bromo-2-methyl-lH-irnidazo[4,5-<br>
b]pyridine can be prepared in 82% yield by heating 2,3-diamino-5-bromopyridine with acetic<br>
acid in polyphosphoric acid according to the methods described by P. K. Dubey et al, Indian<br>
J. Chem. 16B(6):531-533 (1978). 2,3-Diamino-5-bromopyridine can be prepared in 97%<br>
yield by heating 2-amino-5-bromo-3-nitropyridine (commercially available from Aldrich<br>
Chemical Company and Lancaster Synthesis, mc) with tin(II) chloride dihydrate in boiling<br><br>
ethanol according to the techniques described by S. X. Cai et ah, J. Med. Chem. 40(22):<br>
3679-3686 (1997).<br>
In another example, a bromo fused-ring heterocycle, such as 6-bromo-1,3-<br>
 dioxolo[4,5-b]pyridine can be coupled with the previously mentioned olefinic amine side<br>
chain, N-methyl-N-(tert-butoxycarbonyI)-4-penten-2-amine using the Heck reaction. The<br>
resulting Boc-protected intermediate can be deprotected with a strong acid such as<br><br><br>
amine. The requisite bromo compound, 6-bromo-l,3-dioxolo[4,5-b]pyridine can be<br>
synthesized from 5-bromo-2,3-dihydroxypyridme, also known as 5-bromo-3-hydroxy-2(1H)-<br>
pyridinone, via a methylenation procedure using bromochloromethane, in the presence of<br>
potassium carbonate and N,N-dimethylformamide according to the methodology of F.<br>
Dallacker et al., Z. Naturforsch. 34 b:1729-1736 (1979). 5-Bromo-2,3-dihydroxypyridine can<br>
be prepared from furfural (2-furaldehyde, commercially available from Aldrich Chemical<br>
Company and Lancaster Synthesis, Inc.) using the methods described in F. Dallacker et al, Z.<br>
Naturforsch. 34 b: 1729-1736 (1979). Alternatively, 5-bromo-2,3-dihydroxypyridine can be<br>
prepared according to the techniques described in EP 0081745 to D. Rose and N. Maak.<br>
In another example of a compound that possesses a fused-ring heterocycle, the bromo<br>
compound, 7-bromo-2,3-dihydro-1,4-dioxino[2,3-b]pyridine (also known as 7-bromo-5-aza-<br>
4-oxachromane) can be condensed with the previously mentioned olefinic amine side chain,<br>
N-methyl-N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-4-penten-2-amine using the Heck reaction. The resulting<br>
Boc-protected compound can be deprotected with strong acid such as trifluoroacetic acid to<br>
produce (4E)-N-methyl-5-(7-(2,3-dihydro-1,4-dioxino[2,3-b]pyridin)yl-4-penten-2-amine.<br>
The bromo compound, 7-bromo-2,3-dihydro-1,4-dioxino[2,3-b]pyridine, can be prepared by<br>
treating 5-bromo-2,3-dihydroxypyridine with 1,2-dibromoethane and potassium carbonate in<br>
N,N-dimethylformamide according to the methodology of F. Dallacker et al., Z. Naturforsch.<br>
34 b: 1729-1736 (1979). 5-Bromo-2,3-dihydroxypyridine can be prepared from furfural as<br>
described above.<br>
Other polycyclic aromatic compounds can be prepared by the Heck reaction. Thus,<br>
certain compounds can be synthesized by the palladium-catalyzed coupling of a bromo fiised-<br>
ring heterocycle, such as 6-bromo-1H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine-2-thiol with the previously<br>
mentioned olefinic amine side chain, N-methyl-N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-4-penten-2-amine.<br>
The Boc-protected intermediate, resulting from the Heck reaction, can be subjected to<br>
treatment with a strong acid, such as trifluoroacetic acid to produce (4E)-N-methyl-5-(6-(2-<br>
thio-1H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridin)yl)-4-penten-2-amine. The requisite bromo compound, 6-<br>
bromo-1H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine-2-thiol can be prepared by treating 6-bromo-1H-<br>
imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine with sulfur at 230-260° C according to the methods described in Y.<br>
M. Yutilov, Khim. Geterotsikl Doedin. 6:799-804 (1988). 6-Bromo-1H-imidazo[4,5-<br>
b]pyridine can be obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Company. Alternatively, 6-bromo-<br>
1H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine can be prepared by treating 2,3-diammo-5-bromopyridine with<br><br>
formic acid in polyphosphoric acid using methodology similar to that described by P. K.<br>
Dubey et ah, Indian J. Chem. 16B(6):531-533 (1978). 2,3-Diamino-5-bromopyridine can be<br>
prepared in 97% yield by heating 2-arnino-5-bromo-3-nitropyridine (commercially available<br>
from Aldrich Chemical Company and Lancaster Synthesis, Inc) with tin(II) chloride dihydrate<br>
in boiling ethanol according to the techniques described by S. X. Cai et al, J. Med, Chem.,<br>
40(22): 3679-3686 (1997). Alternatively, 6-bromo-lH-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine-2-thiol can be<br>
prepared by heating 2,3-diamino-5-bromopyridine with K+- SCSOEt in aqueous ethanol using<br>
methodology similar to that described by T. C. Kuhler et ah, J. Med Chem. 38(25): 4906-<br>
4916 (1995). 2,3-Diamino-5-bromopyridine can be prepared from 2-amino-5-bromo-3-<br>
nitropyridine as described above.<br>
In a related example, 6-bromo-2-phenylm,ethylthio-lH-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine can be<br>
coupled via Heck reaction with the previously mentioned olefinic amine side chain, N-<br>
methyl-N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-4-penten-2-amine. The resulting Boc-protected intermediate<br>
can be subjected to treatment with a strong acid, such as trifluoroacetic acid to produce (4E)-<br>
N-methyl-5-(6-(2-phenylmethylthio-1H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridin)yl)-4-penten-2-amine. The<br>
bromo compound, 6-bromo-2-phenylmethylthio-lH-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine can be prepared<br>
by alkylating the previously described 6-bromo-1H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine-2-thiol with<br>
benzyl bromide in the presence of potassium carbonate and N,N-dimethylformamide.<br>
In another example, 6-brornooxazolo[4,5-b]pyridine, when submitted sequentially to<br>
palladium catalyzed coupling to N-methyl-N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-4-penten-2-amine and<br>
deprotection with trifluoroacetic acid, gives (4E)-N-methyl-5-(6-oxazolo[4,5-b]pyridinyl)-4-<br>
penten-2-amine. The requisite 6-bromooxazolo[4,5-b]pyridine can be produced from 2-<br>
amino-5-bromo-3-pyridinol by condensation with formic acid or a trialkyl orthoformate,<br>
using methodology similar to that of M-C. Viaud et al, Heterocycles 41: 2799-2809 (1995).<br>
The use of other carboxylic acids produces 2-substituted-6-bromooxazolo[4,5-b]pyridines,<br>
which are also substrates for the Heck reaction. The synthesis of 2-amino-5-bromo-3-<br>
pyridinol proceeds from furfurylamine (Aldrich Chemical Company). Thus, 5-bromo-3-<br>
pyridinol (produced from furfurylamine according to U.S. Pat. No. 4,192,946) can be<br>
chlorinated, using methods described by V. Koch et ah, Synthesis, 499 (1990), to give 2-<br>
chloro-5-bromo-3-pyridinol, which in turn can be converted to 2-amino-5-bromo-3-pyridinol<br>
by treatment with ammonia.<br>
5-Bromooxazolo[5,4-b]pyridine, isomeric by orientation of ring fusion to the<br>
previously described 6-bromooxazolo[4,5-b]pyridine, can also be used in the Heck coupling<br><br>
with N-methyl-N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-4-penten-2-amine. Subsequent removal of the tert-<br>
butoxycarbonyl protecting group provides (4E)-N-methyl-5-(5-oxazolo[5,4-b]pyridinyl)-4-<br>
penten-2-amine. The 5-bromooxazolo[5,4-b]pyridine can be synthesized from 3-amino-5-<br>
bromo-2-pyridinoI (3-amino-5-bromo-2-pyridone) by condensation with formic acid (or a<br>
derivative thereof) as described above. 3-Amino-5-bromo-2-pyridinoI can be made by<br>
bromination (using techniques described by T. Batkowski, Rocz. Chem. 41: 729-741 (1967))<br>
and subsequent tin(n) chloride reduction (according to the method described by S. X. Cai et<br>
al, J. Med. Chem. 40(22): 3679-3686 (1997)) of commercially available 3-nitro-2-pyridinol<br>
(Aldrich Chemical Company).<br>
Other polycyclic aromatic compounds of the present invention can be prepared by the<br>
Heck reaction. Thus both 5-bromofuro[2,3-b]pyridine and 5-bromo-lH-pyrrolo[2,3-<br>
b]pyridine can undergo palladium catalyzed coupling with the previously described olefinic<br>
amine side chain, N-methyl-N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-4-penten-2-amine, to give (4E)-N-<br>
methyl-N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-5-(5-furo[2,3-b]pyridinyl)-4-penten-2-amine and(4E)-N-<br>
methyl-N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-5-(5-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridinyl)-4-penten-2-amine<br>
respectively. Subsequent removal of the tert-butoxycarbonyl group with trifluoroacetic acid<br>
will provide (4E)-N-methyl-5-(5-furo[2,3-b]pyridinyl)-4-penten-2-amine and (4E)-N-methyl-<br>
5-(5-lH-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridinyl)-4-penten-2-amine. The requisite 5-bromofuro[2,3-<br>
b]pyridine and 5-bromo-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine can be made from 2,3-dihydrofuro[2,3-<br>
b]pyridine and 2,3-dihydropyrroIo[2,3-b]pyridine respectively, by bromination (bromine and<br>
sodium bicarbonate in methanol) and dehydrogenation (2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-l,4-<br>
benzoquinone), using chemistry described by E. C. Taylor etal., Tetrahedron 43: 5145-5158<br>
(1987). 2,3-Dihydrofuro[2,3-b]pyridine and 2,3-dihydropyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine are, in turn,<br>
made from 2-chloropyrimidine (Aldrich Chemical Company), as described by A. E. Frissen et<br>
al., Tetrahedron 45: 803-812 (1989), by nucleophilic displacement of the chloride (with the<br>
sodium salt of 3-butyn-l-ol or with 4-amino-l-butyne) and subsequent intramolecular Diels-<br>
Alder reaction. Using similar chemistry, 2,3-dihydrofuro[2,3-b]pyridine and 2,3-<br>
dihydropyrrolo[2,3-b3pyridine are also produced from 3-methylthio-l,2,4-triazene (E. C.<br>
Taylor et ah, Tetrahedron 43:5145-5158 (1987)), which in turn is made from glyoxal and S-<br>
methylthiosemicarbazide (W. Paudler et ah, J. Heterocyclic Chem. 7: 767-771 (1970)).<br>
	Brominated dihydrofuropyridines, dihydropyrrolopyridines, and<br>
dihydropyranopyridines are also substrates for the palladium catalyzed coupling. For instance,<br>
both 5-bromo-2,3-dihydrofuro[2,3-b]pyridine and 5-bromo-2,3-dihydropyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine<br><br>
(from bromination of 2,3-dihydroIuro[2,3-b]pyridine and 2,3-dihydropyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine,<br>
as described above) can be coupled with the previously mentioned olefinic amine side chain<br>
in a Heck process. Subsequent deprotection gives the corresponding (4E)-N-methyl-5-(5-(2,3-<br>
dihydrofuro[2,3-b]pyidin)yl)-4-penten-2-amine and(4E)-N-methyl-5-(5-(2,3-<br>
dihydropyrroIo[2,3-b]pyridin)yl)-4-penten-2-amine. Similar treatment of 6-bromo-2,3-<br>
dihydrofuro[3,2-b]pyridine (isomeric at the ring fusion with the [2,3-b] system) will provide<br>
(4E)-N-methyl-5-(6-(2,3-dihydrofuro[3,2-b]pyridn)yl)-4-penten-2-amine. The requisite 6-<br>
bromo-2,3-dihydrofuro[3,2-b]pyridine can be made from 5-bromo-2-methyl-3-pyridinol by<br>
sequential treatment with two equivalents of lithium diisopropylamide (to generate the 2-<br>
methylenyl, 3-oxy dianion) and one equivalent of dibromomethane. Alternatively, using<br>
chemistry similar to that described by M. U. Koller et al, Synth. Commtm. 25:2963-74<br>
(1995), the silyl-protected pyridinol (5-bromo-2-methyl-3-trimethylsilyloxypyridine) can be<br>
treated sequentially with one equivalent of lithium diisopropylamide and an alkyl or aryl<br>
aldehyde to produce a 2-(2-(l-alkyl- or l-aryl-l-hydroxy)ethyl)-5-bromo-3-<br>
(trimethylsilyloxy)pyridine. Such materials can be converted, by methods (such as acid<br>
catalyzed cyclization or the Williamson synthesis) known to those skilled in the art, into the<br>
corresponding cyclic ethers (2-alkyl- or 2-aryl-6-bromo-2,3-dihydrofuro[3,2-b]pyridines).<br>
Similar chemistry, in which epoxides (instead of aldehydes) are used in reaction with the<br>
pyridinylmethyl carbanion, leads to 2-alkyl- and 2-aryl-7-bromo-2,3-dihydropyrano[3,2-<br>
b]pyridines. These 2-substituted, brominated dihydrofuro- and dihydropyranopyridines are<br>
also substrates for the Heck reaction. For instance, 6-bromo-2,3-dihydro-2-phenylfuro[3,2-<br>
b]pyridine can be coupled, in a palladium catalyzed process, with N-methyl-N-(tert-<br>
butoxycarbonyl)-4-penten-2-amine, and the coupling product treated with trifluoroacetic acid<br>
(to remove the tert-butoxycarbonyl group), to give (4E)-N-methyl-5-(6-(2,3-dihydro-2-<br>
phenylfuro[3,2-b]pyridin)yl)-4-penten-2- amine.<br>
The 5-bromo-2-methyl-3-pyridinol, used to synthesize the brominated dihydrofuro-<br>
and dihydropyranopyridines, is produced by standard transformations of commercially<br>
available materials. Thus, 2-methyinicotinic acid (Aldrich Chemical Company) can be<br>
converted, by sequential treatment with thionyl chloride, bromine, and ammonia<br>
(methodology described by C. V. Greco et al, J. Heterocyclic Chem. 7: 761-766 (1970)), into<br>
 5-bromo-2-methylnicotinamide. Hofmann rearrangement of 5-bromo-2-methylnicotinamide<br>
with hypochlorite will give 3-amino-5-bromo-2-methylpyridine, which can be converted to 5-<br>
bromo-2-methyl-3-pyridinol by diazotization with sodium nitrite in aqueous sulfuric acid.<br><br>
Alternatively, alanine ethyl ester (Aldrich Chemical Company) is converted (using ethyl<br>
formate) into its N-formyl derivative, which is then converted to 5-ethoxy-4-methyloxazole<br>
using phosphorous pentoxide (N. Takeo et al, Japan Patent No. 45,012,732). Diels-Alder<br>
reaction of 5-ethoxy-4-methyloxazole with acrylonitrile gives 5-hydroxy-6-<br>
methylnicotinonitrile (T. Yoshikawa et al, Chem. Pharm. Bull 13: 873 (1965)), which is<br>
converted to 5-amino-2-methyl-3-pyridinol by hydration and Hofinann rearrangement (Y.<br>
Morisawa et al.,Agr. Biol. Chem.39:1275-1281 (1975)). The 5-amino-2-methyl-3-pyridinol<br>
can then be converted, by diazotization in the presence of cuprous bromide, to the desired 5-<br>
bromo-2-methyl-3-pyridinoI.<br>
These methods each provide the (E)-metanicotine-type compounds as the major<br>
product, but also produce a minor amount of the corresponding (Z)-metanicotine-type<br>
compounds and other isomers, as before described. These minor reaction products can be<br>
removed using conventional techniques, if desired. Alternatively, as described in more detail<br>
below, the (E)-metanicotine-type compounds can be isolated as the hydroxybenzoate salts,<br>
which can precipitate out in substantially pure form from a reaction mixture including<br>
hydroxybenzoate salts of the (Z)-metanicotine-type compounds and other minor reaction<br>
products.<br>
Other methods beside the Heck coupling reaction can be used to provide the<br>
compounds. For example, the (E)-metanicotine-type compounds can be prepared using the<br>
techniques set forth by Loffler et al, Chem. Ber., 42:3431-3438 (1909) and Laforge, J.A.C.S.,<br>
50:2477 (1928) from substituted nicotine-type compounds. Certain 6-substituted<br>
metanicotine-type compounds can be prepared from the corresponding 6-substituted nicotine-<br>
type compounds using the general methods of Acheson et al, J. Chem. Soc, Perkin Trans.<br>
l(2):579-585 (1980). The requisite precursors for such compounds, 6-substituted nicotine-<br>
type compounds, can be synthesized from 6-substituted nicotinic acid esters using the general<br>
methods disclosed by Rondahl, Acta Pharm. Suec, 14:113-118 (1977). Preparation of certain<br>
5-substituted metanicotine-type compounds can be accomplished from the corresponding 5-<br>
substituted nicotine-type compounds using the general method taught by Acheson et al, J.<br>
Chem. Soc, Perkin Trans. 1(2): 579-585 (1980). The 5-halo-substituted nicotine-type<br>
compounds (e.g., fluoro- and bromo-substituted nicotine-type compounds) and the 5-amino<br>
nicotine-type compounds can be prepared using the general procedures disclosed by Rondahl,<br>
Act. Pharm. Suec, 14:113-118 (1977). The 5-trifluoromethyl nicotine-type compounds can<br><br>
be prepared using the techniques and materials set forth in Ashimori et al., Chern. Pharm.<br>
Bull, 38(9):2446-2458 (1990) and Rondahl, Acta Pharm. Suec, 14:113-118 (1977).<br>
Formation of E-metanicotine Hydroxybenzoates<br>
The (E)-metanicotine hydroxybenzoates are formed by reacting the E-metanicotine-<br>
type compounds described above with hydroxybenzoic acids. The stoichiometry of the<br>
individual components (E-metanicotine and hydroxybenzoic acid) used to prepare the salts<br>
can vary. It is typical that the molar ratio of hydroxybenzoic acid to base (E-metanicotine) is<br>
typically 2:1 to 1:2, more typically 2:1 or 1:1, but other ratios (such as 3:2) are possible. It is<br>
preferred that the molar ratio of acid to base is 1:1. Depending upon the manner by which the<br>
salts of the present invention are formed, those salts may have crystal structures that may<br>
occlude solvents that are present during salt formation. Thus, salts of the present invention<br>
can occur as hydrates and other solvates of varying stoichiometry of solvent relative to aryl<br>
substituted amine.<br>
The method for providing compounds of the present invention can vary. For instance,<br>
the preparation of (2S)-(4E)-N-methyl-5-(5-isopropoxy-3-pyridinyl)-4-penten-2-amine in a p-<br>
hydroxybenzoate form can involve (i) adding a solution of suitably pure compound dissolved<br>
in ethanol to a solution of p-hydroxybenzoic acid (1-1 equivalents) in ethanol, heated under<br>
reflux, to form a precipitate, (ii) applying heat and/or water and ethanol (water not to exceed<br>
10%) to dissolve the precipitate, (iii) cooling the resulting solution if necessary to cause<br>
precipitation of the salt and (iv) filtering and collecting the salt. The stoichiometry, solvent<br>
mix, solute concentration and temperature employed can vary, but the formation of the salts is<br>
within the level of skill of those of skill in the art.<br>
Formation of Other Salt Forms<br>
If desired, once the hydroxybenzoate salts are isolated, other salt forms can be formed,<br>
for example, by direct reaction with another phannaceutically acceptable acid or by first<br>
isolating the free base (by reaction with strong base and extraction into an appropriate<br>
solvent) and then reaction with another pharmaceutically acceptable acid. Such procedures<br>
are known to those of skill in the art.<br><br>
III. Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention include the<br>
hydroxybenzoates described herein, in the pure state or in the form of a composition in which<br>
the compounds are combined with any other pharmaceutically compatible product, which can<br>
be inert or physiologically active. Such compositions can be administered, for example,<br>
orally, parenterally, rectally, or topically.<br>
Examples of solid compositions for oral administration include, but are not limited to,<br>
tablets, pills, powders (gelatin capsules, cachets), and granules. In these compositions, the<br>
active compound is mixed with one or more inert diluents, such as starch, cellulose, sucrose,<br>
lactose, or silica; ideally, under a stream of an inert gas such as argon.<br>
The compositions can also include substances other than diluents, for example, one or<br>
more lubricants such as magnesium stearate or talc, a colorant, a coating (coated tablets), or a<br>
varnish.<br>
Examples of liquid compositions for oral administration include, but are not limited<br>
to, solutions, suspensions, emulsions, syrups, and elixirs that are pharmaceutically acceptable,<br>
and typically contain inert diluents such as water, ethanol, glycerol, vegetable oils, or liquid<br>
paraffin. These compositions can comprise substances other than the diluents, for example,<br>
wetting agents, sweeteners, thickeners, flavors, and stabilizers.<br>
Sterile compositions for parenteral administration can include, for example, aqueous<br>
or nonaqueous solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. Examples of suitable solvents and<br>
vehicles include, but are not limited to aqueous solutions, preferably buffered aqueous<br>
solutions, propylene glycol, a polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils, especially olive oil,<br>
injectable organic esters, for example ethyl oleate, and other appropriate organic solvents.<br>
These compositions can also include adjuvants, especially wetting agents, isotonicity agents,<br>
emulsifiers, dispersants, and stabilizers. Such sterile compositions can be sterilized in a<br>
number of ways, for example, by asepticizing filtration, by incorporating sterilizing agents<br>
into the composition, by irradiation and by heating. They can also be prepared in the form of<br>
sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved at the time of use in sterile water or any<br>
other sterile injectable medium.<br>
Examples of compositions for rectal administration include, but are not limited to,<br>
 suppositories and rectal capsules that, in addition to the active product, can include excipients<br>
such as cocoa butter, semi-synthetic glycerides, and polyethylene glycols.<br><br>
Compositions for topical administration can, for example, be creams, lotions,<br>
eyewashes, collutoria, nasal drops or aerosols.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions also can include various other components as<br>
additives or adjuncts. Exemplary pharmaceutically acceptable components or adjuncts which<br>
are employed in relevant circumstances include antioxidants, free radical scavenging agents,<br>
peptides, growth factors, antibiotics, bacteriostatic agents, immunosuppressives,<br>
anticoagulants, buffering agents, anti-inflammatory agents, anti-pyretics, time release binders,<br>
anesthetics, steroids, and corticosteroids. Such components can provide additional<br>
therapeutic benefit, act to affect the therapeutic action of the pharmaceutical composition, or<br>
act towards preventing any potential side effects which may be posed as a result of<br>
administration of the pharmaceutical composition. In certain circumstances, a compound of<br>
the present invention can be employed as part of a pharmaceutical composition with other<br>
compounds intended to prevent or treat a particular disorder.<br>
IV. Methods of Treatment<br>
The hydroxybenzoate salts described herein are useful for treating those types of<br>
conditions and disorders for which other types of nicotinic compounds have been proposed as<br>
therapeutics. See, for example, Williams et al, DN&amp;P 7(4):205-227 (1994); Arneric et al,<br>
CNS Drug Rev. l(l):l-26 (1995); Arneric et al, Exp. Opin. Invest. Drugs 5(1):79-100 (1996);<br>
Bencherif et al, J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 279:1413 (1996); Lippiello et al, J. Pharmacol.<br>
Exp. Ther. 279:1422 (1996); Damaj et al, Neuroscience (1997); Holladay et al, J. Med.<br>
Chem. 40(28): 4169-4194 (1997); Bannon et al, Science 279: 77-80 (1998); PCT WO<br>
94/08992; PCT WO 96/31475; and U.S. Patent Nos. 5,583,140 to Bencherif et al; 5,597,919<br>
to Dull et al; and 5,604,231 to Smith et al<br>
The salts can also be used as adjunct therapy in combination with existing therapies in<br>
the management of the aforementioned types of diseases and disorders. In such situations, it<br>
is preferably to administer the active ingredients in a manner that minimizes effects upon<br>
nAChR subtypes such as those that are associated with muscle and ganglia. This can be<br>
accomplished by targeted drug delivery and/or by adjusting the dosage such that a desired<br>
effect is obtained without meeting the threshold dosage required to cause significant side<br>
effects. The pharmaceutical compositions can be used to ameliorate any of the symptoms<br>
associated with those conditions, diseases, and disorders.<br><br>
Examples of conditions and disorders that can be treated include neurological<br>
disorders, neurodegenerative disorders, in particular, CNS disorders, and inflammatory<br>
disorders. CNS disorders can be drug induced; can be attributed to genetic predisposition,<br>
infection or trauma; or can be of unknown etiology. CNS disorders comprise <br>
neuropsychiatric disorders, neurological diseases, and mental illnesses, and include<br>
neurodegenerative diseases, behavioral disorders, cognitive disorders, and cognitive affective<br>
disorders. There are several CNS disorders whose clinical manifestations have been<br>
attributed to CNS dysfunction (i.e., disorders resulting from inappropriate levels of<br>
neurotransmitter release, inappropriate properties of neurotransmitter receptors, and/or<br>
inappropriate interaction between neurotransmitters and neurotransmitter receptors). Several<br>
CNS disorders can be attributed to a deficiency of choline, dopamine, norepinephrine, and/or<br>
serotonin.<br>
Examples of CNS disorders that can be treated using the E-metanicotine compounds<br>
and hydroxybenzoate salts described herein, and pharmaceutical compositions including these<br>
compounds and salts, include pre-senile dementia (early onset Alzheimer's disease), senile<br>
dementia (dementia of the Alzheimer's type), Lewy Body dementia, micro-infarct dementia,<br>
AIDS-related dementia, HIV-dementia, multiple cerebral infarcts, Parkinsonism including<br>
Parkinson's disease, Pick's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, Huntington's chorea,<br>
tardive dyskinesia, hyperkinesia, epilepsy, mania, attention deficit disorder, anxiety,<br>
depression, dyslexia, schizophrenia depression, obsessive-compulsive disorders, Tourette's<br>
syndrome, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), age-associated memory impairment (AAMI),<br>
premature amnesic and cognitive disorders which are age-related or a consequence of<br>
alcoholism, or immunodeficiency syndrome, or are associated with vascular disorders, with<br>
genetic alterations (such as, for example, trisomy 21) or with attention deficiencies or<br>
learning deficiencies, acute or chronic neurodegenerative conditions such as amyotrophic<br>
lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, peripheral neurotrophics, and cerebral or spinal traumas.<br>
In addition, the compounds can be used to treat nicotine addiction and/or other behavioral<br>
disorders related to substances that lead to dependency (e.g., alcohol, cocaine, heroin and<br>
opiates, psychostimulants, benzodiazepines, and barbiturates), and to treat obesity. The<br>
compounds can also be used to treat pathologies exhibiting an inflammatory character within<br>
 the gastrointestinal system such as Crohn's disease, irritable bowel syndrome and ulcerative<br>
colitis, and diarrheas.<br><br>
The manner in which the hydroxybenzoate salts are administered can vary. The salts<br>
can be administered by inhalation (e.g., in the form of an aerosol either nasally or using<br>
delivery articles of the type set forth in U.S. Patent No. 4,922,901 to Brooks et al); topically<br>
(e.g., in lotion form); orally (e.g., in liquid form within a solvent such as an aqueous or non-<br>
aqueous liquid, or within a solid carrier); intravenously (e.g., within a dextrose or saline<br>
solution); as an infusion or injection (e.g., as a suspension or as an emulsion in a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable liquid or mixture of liquids); intrathecally;<br>
intracerebroventricularly; or transdermally (e.g., using a transdermal patch). Although it is<br>
possible to administer the salts in the form of a bulk active chemical, it is preferred to present<br>
each salts in the form of a pharmaceutical composition or formulation for efficient and<br>
effective administration. Exemplary methods for administering such salts will be apparent to<br>
the skilled artisan. For example, the salts can be administered in the form of a tablet, a hard<br>
gelatin capsule or as a time-release capsule. As another example, the salts can be delivered<br>
transdermally using the types of patch technologies available from Novartis and Alza<br>
Corporation. The administration of the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention<br>
can be intermittent, or at a gradual, continuous, constant or controlled rate to a warm-blooded<br>
animal, (e.g., a mammal such as a mouse, rat, cat, rabbit, dog, pig, cow, or monkey); but,<br>
advantageously, the compounds are preferably administered to a human being. In addition,<br>
the time of day and the number of times per day that the pharmaceutical formulation is<br>
administered can vary. Administration preferably is such that the active ingredients of the<br>
pharmaceutical formulation interact with receptor sites within the body of the subject that<br>
affect the functioning of the CNS or of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. More specifically, in<br>
treating a CNS disorder administration preferably is such so as to optimize the effect upon<br>
those relevant receptor subtypes which have an effect upon the functioning of the CNS, while<br>
minimizing the effects upon muscle-type receptor subtypes. Other suitable methods for<br>
administering the salts are described in U.S. Patent No. 5,604,231 to Smith et ah, the<br>
disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
The appropriate dose of the salts is that amount effective to prevent occurrence of the<br>
symptoms of the disorder or to treat some symptoms of the disorder from which the patient<br>
suffers. By "effective amount," "therapeutic amount," or "effective dose" is meant that<br>
amount sufficient to elicit the desired pharmacological or therapeutic effects, thus resulting in<br>
effective prevention or treatment of the disorder. Thus, when treating a CNS disorder, an<br>
effective amount of the hydroxybenzoate salts is an amount required to deliver, across the<br><br>
blood-brain barrier of the subject, a sufficient amount of the free base drug to bind to relevant<br>
receptor sites in the brain of the subject, and to modulate relevant nicotinic receptor subtypes<br>
(e.g., provide neurotransmitter secretion, thus resulting in effective prevention or treatment of<br>
the disorder). Prevention of the disorder is manifested by at least delaying the onset of the<br>
symptoms of the disorder or reducing the severity of the symptoms. Treatment of the<br>
disorder is manifested by a decrease in the symptoms associated with the disorder or an<br>
amelioration of the recurrence of the symptoms of the disorder.<br>
The effective dose can vary, depending upon factors such as the condition of the<br>
patient, the severity of the symptoms of the disorder, and the manner in which the<br>
pharmaceutical composition is administered. For human patients, the effective dose of<br>
typical salts generally requires administering the salts in an amount sufficient to modulate<br>
relevant receptors to affect neurotransmitter (e.g., dopamine) release but the amount should<br>
be insufficient to induce effects on skeletal muscles and ganglia to any significant degree.<br>
The effective dose of the hydroxybenzoate salts will of course differ from patient to patient<br>
but in general includes amounts starting where CNS effects or other desired therapeutic<br>
effects occur, but below the amount where muscular effects are observed.<br>
The doses depend on the desired effect, the duration of treatment and the<br>
administration route used; they are generally between 0.05 mg and 100 mg of active<br>
substance per day orally for an adult. Generally speaking, a medical doctor will determine the<br>
appropriate dosage as a function of the age, weight and all the other factors specific to the<br>
patient.<br>
The salts of the present invention, when employed in effective amounts in accordance<br>
with the method of the present invention, often lack the ability to elicit activation of human<br>
ganglion nAChRs to any significant degree. This selectivity of the salts of the present<br>
invention against those nAChRs responsible for cardiovascular side effects is demonstrated<br>
by a lack of the ability of those salts to activate nicotinic function of adrenal chromaffin<br>
tissue. As such, such salts have poor ability to cause isotopic rubidium ion flux through<br>
nAChRs in cell preparations derived from the adrenal gland. Generally, typical preferred<br>
salts useful in carrying out the present invention maximally activate isotopic rubidium ion<br>
flux by less than 10 percent, often by less than 5 percent, of that maximally provided by S(-)<br>
nicotine.<br>
The salts are effective towards providing some degree of prevention of the progression<br>
of CNS disorders, ameliorating the symptoms of CNS disorders, and ameliorating to some<br><br>
degree the recurrence of CNS disorders. However, such effective amounts of those salts are<br>
not sufficient to elicit any appreciable undesired nicotinic effects, as is demonstrated by<br>
decreased effects on preparations believed to reflect effects on the cardiovascular system, or<br>
effects to skeletal muscle. As such, administration of salts of the present invention provides a<br>
therapeutic window in which treatment of certain CNS disorders is provided, and undesired<br>
peripheral nicotinic effects/side effects are avoided. That is, an effective dose of a compound<br>
of the present invention is sufficient to provide the desired effects upon the CNS, but is<br>
insufficient {ie., is not at a high enough level) to provide undesirable side effects. Preferably,<br>
effective administration of a compound of the present invention resulting in treatment of CNS<br>
disorders occurs upon administration of less than 1/3, frequently less than 1/5, and often less<br>
than 1/10, that amount sufficient to cause any side effects to a significant degree.<br>
The following synthetic and analytical examples are provided to illustrate the present<br>
invention, and should not be construed as limiting thereof. In these examples, all parts and<br>
percentages are by weight, unless otherwise noted. Reaction yields are reported in mole<br>
percentages.<br>
Example 1: Synthesis of (2S)-(4E)-N-methyl-5-(5-isopropoxy-3-pyridinyl)-4-penten-2-<br>
amine p-hydroxybenzoate<br>
(2S)-(4E)-N-methyl-5-(5-isopropoxy-3-pvridinyl)-4-penten-2-amine p-hvdroxybenzoate<br>
p-Hydroxybenzoic acid (2.62 g, 19.0 mmol) was added in portions to a stirred solution<br>
(2S)-(4E)- N-methyl-5-(5-isopropoxy-3-pyridinyI)-4-penten-2-amine (4.79 g of 93% pure,<br>
19.0 mmol) in isopropyl acetate (50 mL). During the addition, crystallization of salt was<br>
evident. After complete addition of the p-hydroxybenzoic acid, the suspension was heated<br>
near its boiling point as isopropanol was slowly added. After 15 mL of isopropanol had been<br>
added, complete dissolution was obtained. Cooling of the solution to ambient temperature<br>
(overnight) resulted in deposition of a crystalline mass, which was collected by suction<br>
filtration and air dried (4.03 g). A second crop (0.82 g) was isolated from the concentrated<br>
filtrate, by addition of acetone. The two crops of crystals were combined and recrystallized<br>
from acetone (50 mL). The solid was collected by suction filtration and dried in the vacuum<br>
oven (50°C) for 18 h. This left 4.24 g (60.0%) of white crystals (98+% pure by both GCMS<br>
and LCMS;m.p.99-101°C).<br><br>
Example 2: Synthesis of (2S)-(4E)- N-methyl-5~(5-isopropoxy-3-pyridinyi)-4-penten-2-<br>
amine (via the Heck reaction with (S)-N-Methyl-N-(tert-butoxycarbonyI)-4-pcnten-2-<br>
amine) and the use of the p-hydroxybenzoate salt to facilitate isolation and purification<br>
of (2S)-(4E)- N-methyl-5-(5-isopropoxy-3-pyridinyl)-4-penten-2-amine:<br>
3-Bromo-5-isopropoxypyridine<br>
A 72 L reactor was charged successively with sodium tert-pentoxide (2.2 kg, 20 mol)<br>
and l-methyI-2-pyrrolidinone (17.6 L). This mixture was stirred for 1 h, and then 2-propanol<br>
(12 L) was added over a period of 2 h. 3,5-Dibromopyridine (3.0 kg, 13 mol) was then added<br>
to the reactor, and the mixture was heated at 75°C for 12 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. The<br>
mixture was then cooled, diluted with toluene (15 L), and washed with water (30 L). The<br>
aqueous phase was extracted with toluene (15 L), and the combined toluene phases were<br>
washed with water (15 L) and concentrated under reduced pressure, to give 2.5 kg of dark oil.<br>
This was combined an equal sized batch of material from a second run and vacuum distilled<br>
(b.p. 65°C at 0.3 mm), to yield 3.1 kg (57%) of 3-bromo-5-isopropoxypyridine as a pale<br>
yellow oil.<br>
(2R)-4-Penten-2-ol<br>
(2R)-4-Penten-2-ol was prepared in 82.5% yield from (R)-(+)-propylene oxide<br>
according to procedures set forth in A. Kalivretenos, J. K. Stille, and L. S. Hegedus, J. Org.<br>
Chem. 56:2883(1991).<br>
(S)-N-Methyl-N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-4-penten-2-amine<br>
A mixture of (R)-4-penten-2-ol (7.62 g, 88.5 mmol), pyridine (15 mL), and dry<br>
(distilled from calcium hydride) dichloromethane (30mL) was stirred in an ice bath as p-<br>
toluenesulfonyl chloride (18.6 g, 97.4 mmol) was added over a 3 min period. The mixture<br>
was stirred 20 min at 0°C and 16 h at ambient temperature, as a heavy precipitate formed.<br>
Saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate (75 mL) was added, and the biphasic mixture was<br>
stirred vigorously for 3 h. The dichloromethane phase and two dichloromethane extracts (50<br>
mL each) of the aqueous phase were combined, dried (Na2SO4), and concentrated by rotary<br>
evaporation. High vacuum treatment left 18.7g of light yellow oil, which was combined with<br>
dimethylformamide (DMF) (35 mL) and 40% aqueous methylamine (35 mL). This solution<br>
was stirred at ambient temperature for 48 h and then poured into a mixture of saturated<br>
aqueous sodium chloride (300 mL) and 2.5 M sodium hydroxide (50 mL). This mixture was<br><br>
extracted with ether (5 x 250 mL), and the ether extracts were dried (Na2SO4) and<br>
concentrated by rotary evaporation (from an ice cooled bath) to a volume of about 250 mL.<br>
The remaining solution was combined with di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (16.9 g, 77-4 mmol) and<br>
THF (100 mL), and the mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 16 h. The volatiles<br>
were evaporated by rotary evaporation, and the residue was vacuum distilled at 5 mm<br>
pressure ( bp 79-86°C), to give 7.74 g (43.9 % yield) of clear, colorless liquid.<br>
(2S)-(4E)-N-Methyl-5-(5-isopropoxy-3-pyridinyl)-4-penten-2-amine p-<br>
hvdroxybenzoate<br>
A mixture of 3-bromo-5-isopropoxypyridine (21.0 g, 97.2 mmol), (S)-N-Methyl-N-<br>
(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-4-penten-2-amine (24.0 g, 120 mmol), DMF (53 mL), K2CO3 (22 g,<br>
159 mmol), palladium(II) acetate (0.22 g, 0.98 mmol) and tri-o-tolylphosphine (0.57 g, 1.9<br>
mmol) was degassed and placed under a nitrogen atmosphere. The stirred mixture was then<br>
heated at 130°C for 2.5 h. To remove palladium salts, Smopex™ (20 g) and ethyl acetate<br>
(100mL) were added. The stirred mixture was heated at 50°C for 5 h and at ambient<br>
temperature for 16 h and then filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure,<br>
and the residue (83 g) was dissolved in methanol (25 mL), cooled in a cold water bath (
and treated drop-wise with 6 M HC1 (100 mL). This mixture was stirred 3 h at ambient<br>
temperature, and the methanol was removed by concentration under vacuum. The remaining<br>
aqueous mixture was washed with dichloromethane (100 mL), made basic by careful (with<br>
cooling) addition of 3 M NaOH, and extracted (2 x 200 mL) with dichloromethane. These<br>
latter extracts were washed with saturated aqueous NaCl and concentrated under vacuum.<br>
The residue was dissolved in acetone (150 mL), and p-hydroxybenzoic acid (14.0 g, 101<br>
mmol) was added. After complete dissolution of the p-hydroxybenzoic acid, the solution was<br>
kept at ambient temperature, as a large amount of solid formed (several hours). After several<br>
hours of cooling at -15°C, the mixture was suction filtered. The resulting solid (24.8 g) was<br>
recrystallized from acetone (240 mL) to give 22.3 g (61.6%) of off-white crystals (97+% pure<br>
by GCMS and LCMS).<br><br>
Example 3: Synthesis of (2S)-(4E)-N-methyl-5-(5-methoxy-3-pyridinyl)-4-penten-2-<br>
amine 2,5-dihydroxybenzoate (gentisate)<br>
(2S)-(4E)-N-Methyl-5-(5-methoxy-3-pvridiny)-4-penten-2-amine 2.5-<br>
dihydroxybenzoate<br>
A hot solution of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (gentisic acid) (0.582 g, 3.78 mmol) in<br>
absolute ethanol (1 mL) was added to a warm solution of (2S)-(4E)-N-methyl-5-(5-methoxy-<br>
3-pyridinyl)-4-penten-2-amine (1.00 g, 4.85 mmol, 86.7% E isomer by GC-FID) in absolute<br>
ethanol (1 mL), using additional ethanol (2 mL) in the transfer. The resulting mixture was<br>
concentrated via rotary evaporation, leaving 1.5 mL of ethanol in the solution. With stirring<br>
and heating to near reflux, crystallization occurred. The resulting hot mixture was treated<br>
drop-wise with ethyl acetate (5.5 mL). After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was<br>
further cooled at 5°C for 48 h. The resulting solids were filtered, washed with ethyl acetate (2<br>
x 5 mL) anddried at 50°C to give 1.24 g (91%) of an off-white powder (98.0% E isomer by<br>
GC-FID for the free base). To remove the color from the sample, the material was<br>
recrystallized from ethanol/isopropanol (3.5 mL: 5.5 mL) to give 1.03 g (83% recovery) of an<br>
off-white powder and subsequently recrystallized from ethanol/ethyl acetate (3 mL: 12 mL)<br>
to give 0.90 g (87% recovery) of a white, crystalline powder, mp 166-167°C.<br>
Example 4: Synthesis of E-metanicotine 2,5-dihydroxybenzoate<br>
E-Metanicotine 2,5-dihydroxybenzoate<br>
2,5-Dihydroxybenzoic acid (gentisic acid) (0.475 g, 3.08 mmol) was added to a<br>
solution of E-metanicotine (0.500 g, 3.08 mmol) in ethyl acetate (3 mL) and isopropanol (2.5<br>
mL), and the resulting mixture was gently heated until all solids dissolved. Upon cooling, a<br>
white granular precipitate was deposited, and the mixture was cooled at 5°C. The solids were<br>
filtered, washed with cold isopropanol (3x2 mL) and dried under vacuum at 40°C for 4 h to<br>

Example 5: Synthesis of E-metanicotine 3,5-dihydroxybenzoate<br>
	E-Metanicotine 3,5-dihvdroxybenzoate<br><br>
3,5-Dihydroxybenzoic acid (0.475 g, 3.08 mmol) was added to a warm solution of E-<br>
metanicotine (0.500 g, 3.08 mmol) in isopropanol (11 mL) and methanol (4.5 mL). Upon<br>
heating to near reflux to dissolve the resulting gum, the light-yellow solution was cooled to<br>
room temperature and further cooled at 5°C. The resulting dark-yellow gum that was<br>
deposited was dissolved in isopropyl acetate (3 mL) and methanol (4 mL), assisted by<br>
heating. After cooling to room temperature and further cooling at 5°C, the off-white solids<br>
were filtered, washed with isopropyl acetate and dried to give 0.505 g (51.8 %) of waxy, tan<br>
flakes, mp 160-161.5°C. 1H NMR (D2O): mono-salt stoichiometry. Calcd. for C10H14N2 <br>

Analytical Examples<br>
Example 6: Determination of Binding to Relevant Receptor Sites<br>
The interaction of the hydroxybenzoate salts with relevant receptor sites can be<br>
determined in accordance with the techniques described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,597,919 to Dull et<br>
al. Inhibition constants (Ki values), reported in nM, can be calculated from the IC50 values<br>
using the method of Cheng et al, Biochem, Phamacol. 22:3099 (1973). Low binding<br>
constants indicate that the components of the salts described herein exhibit good high affinity<br>
binding to certain CNS nicotinic receptors.<br>
