Most preferred as compounds of the formula I are those wherein the substituents have the meaning given in the Examples.<br>
The present invention also provides a process for the production of a compound of formula I, comprising reacting a compound of formula II<br><br><br><br>
If one or more other functional groups, for example carboxy, hydroxy or amino, are or need to be protected in a compound of formula II or III, because they should not take part in the reaction, these are such groups as are usually used in the synthesis of peptide compounds, cephalosporins and penicillins, as well as nucleic acid derivatives and sugars.<br>
The protecting groups may already be present in precursors and should protect the functional groups concerned against unwanted secondary reactions, such as substitution reaction or solvolysis. It is a characteristic of protecting groups that they lend themselves readily, Le. without undesired secondary reactions, to removal, typically by solvolysis, reduction, photolysis or also by enzymtfactivity, for example under conditions analogous to physiological conditions; ^ and that they are not present in the end-products; The specialist knows, or can easily establish, which protecting groups are suitable with the reactions mentioned hereinabove-;<br>
Salts of a compound of formula I with a salt-forming group may be prepared in a manner known per se. Acid addition salts of compounds of formula I may thus be obtained by treatment with an acid or with a suitable anion exchange reagent - ± ^i:n<br>
Salts can usually be converted to compounds in free form, e.g. by treating with suitable basic agents, for example with alkali metal carbonates, alkali metal hydrogencarbonates, or alkali      -metal hydroxides, typfcally potassium carbonate or sodium TiydroxideT-      '-<br>
Stereoisomer^ mixtures, e.g; mixtures of diastereomers, can be separated into their corresponding isomers in a manner known per se by means of suitable separation methods. Diastereomeric mixtures for example may be separated into their individual diastereomers by means of fractionated crystallization, chromatography, solvent distribution, and similar procedures. This separation may take place either at the level of a starting compound or in a compound of formula I itself. Enantiomers may be separated through the formation of diastereomeric salts, for example by salt formation with an enantiomer-pure chiral acid, or by means of chromatography, for example by HPLC, using chromatographic substrates with chiral ligands.<br>
It should be emphasized that reactions analogous to the conversions mentioned in this chapter may also take place at the level of appropriate intermediates.<br><br>
The compounds of formula I, including their salts, are also obtainable in the form of hydrates, or their crystals can include for example the solvent used for crystallization (present as solvates).<br><br>
wherein R\ R2, R3, R4, R5 and Re are as defined above, and Y1 and Y2 are identical or different<br>
leaving groups as defined above for Y. The reaction conditions are those mentioned above for<br>
the reaction of a compound of formula II with a compound of formula III.  "-■ "-	"<br>

The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts exhibit valuable pharmacological properties when tested in vitro in cell-free kinase assays and in cellular assays, and are therefore useful as pharmaceuticals. In particular, the compounds of the invention are inhibitors of Focal Adhesion Kinase, and are useful as pharmaceuticals to treat conditions caused by a malfunction of signal cascades connected with Focal Adhesion Kinase, in particular tumors as described hereinbelow.<br>
Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) is a key enzyme in the integrin-mediated outside-in signal - -   ■ cascade (D. Schlaepfer et al., Prog Biophys Mol Biol 1999, 71,435-478). Interaction between cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins is transduced as intracellular signals important for growth, survival and migration through cell surface receptors, integrins. FAK plays an essential<br><br>
role in these integrin-mediated outside-in signal cascades. The trigger in the signal transduction cascade is the autophosphorylation of Y397. Phosphorylated Y397 is a SH2 docking site for Src family tyrosine kinases. The bound c-Src kinase phosphorylates other tyrosine residues in FAK. Among them, phsophorylated Y925 becomes a binding site for the SH2 site of Grb2 small adaptor protein. This direct binding of Grb2 to FAK is one of the key steps for the activation of down stream targets such as the Ras-ERK2/MAP kinase cascade. *<br>
The inhibition of endogenous FAK signalling results in reduced motility and in some cases induces cell death; On the other hand, enhancing FAK signalling by exogenous expression increases oelhnotiltty and transmitting a cell survival signal from ECM. In addition FAK is.^-v-' overexpressed in invasive and metastatic epithelial, mesenchymal, thyroid and prostate cancers. Consequently, an inhibitor of FAK is likely tot&gt;e a drug for anti-tumor growth and metastasis. The compounds of the invention are thus indicated, for example, to prevent and/or treat a vertebrate and more particularly a mammal, affected by a neoplastic disease, in particular: breast tumor, cancer of the bowel (colon and rectum), stomach cancer and cancer of the ovary and prostate, non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, cancer of liver, melanoma, bladder tumor and cancer of head and neck.<br>
The relation between FAK Inhibition and immuno-system is described e.g. in GA van Seventer et al., Eur. J.-lmmunol; 2001, 31,1417-1427. Therefore, the compounds of xhe invention are, for example, useful to prevent and/or treat a vertebrate and more particularly a mammal, affected by immune system disorders, diseases or disorders mediated by T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, mast cells and/or eosinophils e.g. acute or chronic rejection of organ or tissue alio- or xenografts, atherosclerosis, vascular occlusion due to vascular injury such as angioplasty, restenosis, hypertension, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, CNS disease such as Alzheimer disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, cancer, infectious disease such as AIDS, septic shock or adult respiratory distress syndrome, ischemia/reperfusion injury e.g. myocardial infarction, stroke, gut ischemia, renal failure or hemorrhage shock, or traumatic shock. The agent of the invention are also useful in the treatment and/or prevention of acute or chronic inflammatory diseases or disorders or autoimmune diseases e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, diabetes (type i and II) and the disorders associated with therewith;-" ~ respiratory diseases such as asthma or inflammatory liver injury, inflammatory glomerular injury, cutaneous manifestations of immunologically-mediated disorders or illnesses, inflammatory and<br><br>
hyperproliferative skin diseases (such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, irritant contact dermatitis and further eczematous dermatitises, seborrhoeic dermatitis), inflammatory eye diseases, e.g. Sjoegren's syndrome, keratoconjunctivitis or uveitis, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.<br>
Compounds of the invention are active in a FAX assay system as described in the Examples, and show an inhibition IC50 in the range of 1 nM to 100 nM. Particularly active are the compounds Example No, 3-12 and No. 3-17 described hereinbelow showing IC50 vales in the range of 1 to 5 nM.<br>
Some of the compounds of the invention exhibit also ZAP-70 (zeta chain-associated protein of 70 kD) protein tyrosine kinase inhibiting activity. ZAP-70 protein tyrosine kinase interaction of the agents of the invention may be demonstrated by their ability to prevent phosphorylation of e.g. LAT-11 (linker for activation of T cell) by human ZAP-70 protein tyrosine kinase in aqueous solution, as described in the Examples. The compounds of the invention are thus also indicated for the prevention or treatment of disorders or diseases where ZAP-70 inhibition inhibition play a role.<br>
Compounds of the invention are active in a ZAP-70 assay system as described in the Examples, and show an inhibition IC50 in the range of 1 pM to 10 pM, e.g. the compounds Example No. 2 and No. 3-2 described hereinbelow.<br>
Compounds of the present invention are also good inhibitors of the IGF-IR (insulin like growth factor receptor 1) and are therefore useful in the treatment of IGF-1R mediated diseases for example such diseases include proliferative diseases, such as tumours, like for example breast, renal, prostate, colorectal, thyroid, ovarian, pancreas, neuronal, lung, uterine and gastrointestinal tumours as well as osteosarcomas and melanomas. The efficacy of the compounds of the invention as inhibitors of IGF-IR tyrosine kinase activity can be demonstrated using a cellular "Capture ELISA". In this assay the activity of the compounds of the invention against Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) induced autophosphoryiation of the IGF-IR is determined.<br>
The compounds of the present invention also exhibit powerful inhibition of the tyrosine kinase activity of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and the fusion protein of NPM-ALK. This protein tyrosine kinase results from a gene fusion of nucleophosmin (NPM) and the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), rendering the protein tyrosine kinase activity of ALK ligand-<br><br>
independent. NPM-ALK plays a key role in signal transmission in a number of hernatopoetic and other human cells leading to hematological and neoplastic diseases, for example in anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), specifically in ALK+ NHL or Alkomas, in inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (IMT) and neuroblastomas. (Duyster J et al. 2001 Oncogene 20, 5623-5637). In addition to NPM-ALK, other gene fusions have been identified in human hematological and neoplastic diseases; mainly TPM3-ALK (a fusion of nonmuscle tropomyosin with ALK).<br>
The inhibition of ALK tyrosine kinase activity can be demonstrated using known methods,<br>
for example using the recombinant kinase domain of the ALK in analogy to the^EGF-R,; f*<br>
kinase assay described in J. Wood et al. Cancer Res. §0, 2178*2189 (2000). In vitro  ■■- --<br>
enzyme assays using GST-ALK protein tyrosine kinase are performed in 96-weII plates as^<br>
a filter binding assay in 20 mM TrisHCI, pH = 7,5, 3 mM MgCI2,40 mM MnCI2,1-mM DTT;<br>
0.1 pCi/assay (=30 pi) [T^PJ-ATP, 2 pM ATP, 3 pg/ml poly (Glu, Tyr4:1) Poly-EY: {Sigma<br>
P-0275), 1 % DMSO, 25 ng ALK enzyme. Assays are incubated for 10 min at ambient<br>
temperature. Reactions are terminated by adding 50 pi of 125 itiM EDTA, and the reaction-<br>
mixture is transferred onto a MAIP Multiscreen plate (Miliipore, Bedford, MA, USA),<br>
previously wet with methanol, and rehydrated for 5 min with H20. Following washing (0.5<br>
% H3PO4), plates are counted in a liquid scintillation counter. IG50 values are calculated by ~<br>
linear regression-analysis of the percentage inhibition. Compared with the controLwithout --=<br>
inhibitor, the compounds of formula I inhibit the enzyme activity by 50 % (IC50), for y-	-^<br>
example in a concentration of from 0.001 to 0.5 ^LM, especially from 0.01 to 0.1 \M:<br>
The compounds of formula I potently inhibit the growth of human NPM-ALK overexpressing murine BaF3 cells (DSMZ Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH, Braunschweig, Germany). The expression of NPM-ALK is achieved by transfecting the BaF3 cell line with an expression vector pClneo™ (Promega Corp., Madison Wl, USA) coding for NPM-ALK and subsequent selection of G418 resistant cells. Non-transfected BaF3 cells depend on IL-3 for cell survival. In contrast NPM-ALK expressing BaF3 cells (named BaF3-NPM-ALK hereinafter) can proliferate In the absence of IL-3 because they obtain proliferative signal through NPM-ALK kinase. Putative inhibitors of toe NPM-ALK kinase therefore abolish the^ growth signal and result In antiproliferative activity. The antiproliferative activity of putative" ^~ Inhibitors of the NPM-ALK kinase can however be overcome by addition of IL-3 which provides growth signals through an NPM-ALK independent mechanism. [For an analogous cell system<br><br>
using FLT3 kinase see E Weisberg et al. Cancer Cell; 1,433-443 (2002)]. The inhibitory activity<br>
of the compounds of formula I is determined, briefly, as follows: BaF3-NPM-ALK cells<br>
(15,000/micratltre plate well) are transferred to 96-well microtitre plates. The test compounds<br>
[dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)] are added in a series of concentrations (dilution series)<br>
in such a manner that the final concentration of DMSO is not greater than 1 % (v/v). After the<br>
addition, the plates are incubated for two days during which the control cultures without test<br>
compound are able to undergo two cell-division cycles. The growth of the BaF3-NPM-ALK cells<br>
is measured by means of Yopro™ staining [T Idziorek et al. J. Immunol. Methods; 185: 249-258<br>
(1995)]: 25 pi of lysis buffer consisting of 20 mM sodium citrate, pH 4.0,26.8 mM sodium<br>
chloride, 0.4 % NP40, 20 mM EDTA and 20 mM is added to each well. Cell lysis is completed<br>
within 60 min at room temperature and total amount of Yopro bound to DNA is determined by :<br>
measurement using the Cytofluor II 96-well reader (PerSeptive Biosysterns) with the following<br>
settings: Excitation (nm) 485/20 and Emission (nm) 530/25.<br>
IC50 values are determined by a computer-aided system using the formula:	- ■----<br>
IC50 = [(ABStert- ABS8tari)/(ABSCortn)i - ABS^rt)] x 100. (ABS = absorption)<br>
The )C50 value in those experiments is given as that concentration of the test compound in	"<br>
question that results In a cell count that is 50 % lower than that obtained using the control "" "~~^ without inhibitor. The compounds of formula I exhibit inhibitory activity with an IC50 in the range from approximately 0.01 to 1 ^iM.<br>
The antiproliferative acton of the compounds of formula I can also be determined in the human KARPAS-299 lymphoma cell line (DSMZ Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH, Braunschweig, Germany) [described in WG Dirks et al. int. J. Cancer 100. 49-56 (2002)] using the same methodology described above for the BaF3-NPM-ALK cell line. The compounds of formula I exhibit inhibitory activity with an IC50 in the range from approximately 0.01 to 1 /iM.<br>
The action of the compounds of formula I on autophosphorylation of the ALK can be determined in the human KARPAS-299 lymphoma cell line by means of an immunoblot as described in WG Dirks et al. Int. J. Cancer 100,49-56 (2002). Inlhat test the compounds of formula I exhibit an IC5o of approximately from 0.001 to 1 pM.<br><br>
Among the compounds of formula 1,2-[5-chloro-2-(2-methoxy-4-morphoIin-4-yl-phenylamino)-pyrimidin-4-yIamino]-N-methyl-benzamide is an especially potent ALK inhibitor, in that this compound inhibits the growth of the BaF3-NPM-ALK cells with an IC50 of 97 nM. Further specifically preferred compounds that inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) are the compounds described hereinafter in the examples 7A and 7B, as well as 7-2, 7-15, 7-36, 7-39, 7-44 and 7-52, respectively, all of which are having an ICB0 within the range from

Example 53: FAK Assay<br>
All steps are performed in a 96-well black microtiter plate. Purified recombinant hexahistidine-tagged human FAK kinase domain is diluted with dilution buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5,0.01% BSA, 0.05% Tween-20 in water) to a concentration of 94 ng/mL (2.5 nM). The reaction mixture is prepared by mixing 10 pL 5x kinase buffer (250 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 pM Na3V04l 5 mM DTT, 10 mM MgCI2, 50 mM MnCI2,0.05% BSA, 0.25% Tween-20 in water), 20 pL water, 5 pL of 4 pM biotinylated peptide substrate (Biot-Y397) in aqueous solution, 5 pL of test compound in DMSO, and 5 pL of recombinant enzyme solution and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The enzyme reaction is started by addition of 5 pL of 5 pM ATP in water and the mixture is incubated for 3 hours at 37°C. The reaction is terminated by addition of 200 pL of detection mixture (1 nM Eu-PT66, 2.5 pg/mL SA-(SL)APC, 6.25 mM EDTA in dilution buffer), and the FRET signal from europium to allophycocyanin is measured by ARVOsx+L (Perkin Elmer) after 30 min of incubation at room temperature. The ratio of fluorescence intensity of 665 nm to 615 nm is used as a FRET signal for data analysis in order to cancel the colour quenching effect by a test compound. The results are shown as percent inhibition of enzyme activity. DMSO and 0.5 M EDTA are used as a control of 0% and 100% inhibition, respectively. IC50 values are determined by non-linear curve fit analysis using the OrlginPro 6.1 program (OriginLab).<br><br>
The Biot-Y397 peptide (Btofin-SETDDYAEIID ammonium salt) is designed to have the same amino acid sequence as the region from S392 to D402 of human (GenBank Accession Number L13616) and is prepared by standard methods.<br>
Purified recombinant hexahistidine-tagged human FAK kinase domain is obtained in the following way: FulHength human FAK cDNA is isolated by PCR amplification from human placenta Marathon-Ready™ cDNA (Clontech, No. 7411-1) with the 5' PCR primer (ATGGCAGCTGCTTACCTTGAC) and the 3' PCR primer (TCAGTGTGGTCTCGTCTGCCC) and subcloned into a pGEM-T vector (Promega, No. A3600). After digestion with Acclll, the purified DNA fragment is treated with Klenow fragment The cDNA fragment is digested with BamHi and cloned into pFastBacHTb plasmid (Invitrogen Japan K.K., Tokyo) previously cut with BamHI and Stu I. The resultant plasmid, hFAK KD (M384-G706)/pFastBacHTb, is sequenced to confirm its structure. The resulting DNA encodes a 364 amino acid protein containing a hexahistidine tag, a spacer region and a rTEV protease cleavage site at the N-terminal and the kinase domain of FAK (Met384-6ly706) from position 29 to 351.  ~:<br>
Donor plasmid is transposed into the bacuiovirus genome, using MaxEfficacy DHIOBac Ecoli cells. Bacmid DNA is prepared by a simple alkaline lysis protocol described in the Bac-to-Bac® Bacuiovirus Expression system (Invitrogen). Sf9 insect cells are transfected based on the protocol provided by the vendor (CellFECTIN®, invitrogen). The expression of FAK in each lysate is analysed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-human FAK monoclonal antibody (clone #77 from Transduction Laboratories).<br>
The virus clone that shows the highest expression is further amplified by infection to Sf9 cells. Expression in ExpresSF+® cells (Protein Sciences Corp., Meriden, Connecticut, USA) gives high level of protein with little degradation. Cell iysates are loaded onto a column of HiTrap™ Chelating Sepharose HP (Amersham Biosciences) charged with nickel sulfate and equilibrated with 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 0.5 M NaCI and 10 mM imidazole. Captured protein is eluted with increasing amounts of imidazole in HEPES buffer / NaCI, and further purified by dialysis in 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5,10% glycerol and 1 mM DTT.<br>
Example 54: Cell-free ZAP-70 Kinase assay<br>
The ZAP-70 kinase assay is based on time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer<br>
(FRET). 80 nM ZAP-70 are incubated with 80 nM Lck (lymphoid T-ceil protein tyrosine kinase)<br><br>
and 4 }M ATP in ZAP-70 kinase buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5,10 |oM NasVO* 1 mM DTT, 1 mM MnCb, 0.01 % BSA, 0.05 % Tween-20) for 1 hour at room temperature in a siliconized polypropylene tube. Then, the selective Lck inhibitor PP2 (1-tert-butyl-3-(4-diloro-phenyI)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4-ylamine; Alexis Biochemicals) is added (final concentration 1.2 pM) and incubated for further 10 min. 10 JJL of this solution is mixed with the 10 pL biotinylated peptide LAT-11 (1 JIM) as substrate and 20 jxL of serial dilutions of inhibitors and incubated for 4 hours at room temperature. The kinase reaction is terminated with 10 yL of a 10 rnM EDTA solution in detection buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.01 % BSA, 0.05 % Tween-20). 50 jiL europiurn-labelled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Eu-PT66; final concentration 0.125 nM); and 50 pL streptavidin-allophycocyanine (SA-APC; final concentration 40 nM) in detection buffer are added. After 1 hour incubation at room temperature fluorescence is measured on the Victor2 Multilabel Counter (Waliac) at 665 nm. Background values (low control) are obtained in the absence of test samples and ATP and are subtracted from all values. Signals obtained in the absence of test samples are taken as 100% (high control). The inhibition obtained in the presence of test compounds is calculated as percent inhibition of the high control. The concentration of test compounds resulting in 50% inhibition (IC50) is determined from the dose-response curves. In this assay, the agents of the invention have IC50 values in the range of 10 nM to 2 pM, preferably from 10 nM to 100 nM.<br>
Recombinant ZAP-70 kinase is obtained as follows: A nucleic acid encoding full-length human   -ZAP-70 (GenBank #L05148) is amplified from a Jurkat cDNA library by RT-PCR and cloned into the pBluescript KS vector (Stratagene, California, USA). The authenticity of the ZAP-70 cDNA insert is validated by complete sequence analysis. This donor plasmid is then used to construct a recombinant baculovirus transfer vector based on the plasmid pVL1392 (Pharmingen, California, USA) featuring in addition an N-terminal hexahistidine tag. Following co-transfection with AcNPV viral DNA, 10 independent viral isolates are derived via plaque-purification, amplified on small scale and subsequently analyzed for recombinant ZAP-70 expression by Western Blot using a commercially available anti-ZAP-70 antibody (Clone 2F3.1, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY, USA). Upon further amplification of one positive recombinant plaque, titrated virus stocks are prepared and used for infection of Sf9 cells grown in serum-free SF900 II medium (Life Technologies, Basel, Switzerland) under defined, optimized conditions. ZAP-70 protein is isolated from the iysate of infected Sf9 cells by affinity chromatography on a Ni-NTAcolumn (Qiagen, Basel, Switzerland).<br><br>
Recombinant His-tagged ZAP-70 is also available from PanVera LLC, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.<br>
LAT-11 (linker for activation of T cell): The biotinylated peptide LAT-11 (Biotrrv-EEGAPDYEIMLQELN) used as a substrate in the ZAP-70 kinase assay is prepared in analogy to known methods of peptide synthesis. The N-a Fmoc group of Fmoc-Asn(Trt)-oxymethyl-4-phenoxymethyl-co(polystyrene-1%-divinyl-benzene)) content of Asn approx. 0,5 mmol/g, is cleaved using piperidine, 20% in DMF. Four equivalents per amino-group of Fmoc-amino acid protected in their side chains [Asp(OtBu), Giu(OtBu), Asn(Trt), GlnfTrt) and Tyr(tBu)] are coupled using DIPCDI and HOBt in DMF. After complete assembly of the peptide chain the terminal Fmoc-protecting group is removed with piperidine in DMF as before. L(+)-biotinyl-aminohexanoic acid is then coupled to the terminal amino group using DIPCDI and HOBt in DMF using four equivalents of the reagents for four days at RT. The peptide is cleaved from the" resin support and all side-chain protecting groups are simultaneously removed by using a reagent consisting of 5% dodecylmethyisulfide and 5% water in TFA for two hours at RT. Resin particles are filtered off, washed with TFA and the product is precipitated from the combined filtrates by the addition of 10 to 20 volumes of diethyl ether, washed with ether and dried. The product is purified by chromatography on a C-18 wide-pore silica column using a gradient of acetonitrile in 2% aqueous phosphoric acid. Fractions containing the pure compound are collected, filtered through an anron-exchange resin (Biorad, AG4-X4 acetate form) and" lyophilized to give the title compound. MS: 1958.0 (M-H)"1<br>

Example 59 In vivo activity in the nude mouse xenograft model: female or male BALB/c nude mice (5-8 weeks old, Charles River Japan, Inc., Yokohama, Japan) are kept under sterile conditions with water and feed ad libitum. Tumours are induced by subcutaneous injection of tumour cells (human epithelial cell line MIA PaCa-2; European Collection of Cell Cultures (ECACC), Salisbury, Wiltshire, UK, Catalogue Number 85062806; cell line from a 65 year old Caucasian male; undifferentiated human pancreatic carcinoma cell line) into left or right flank of mice under Forene* anaesthesia (Abbott Japan Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Treatment with the test compound is started when the mean tumor volumes reached approximately 100 mm3. Tumour growth is measured two times per week and 1 day after the last treatment by determining the length of two perpendicular axis. The tumour volumes are calculated in accordance with published methods (see Evans et a!., Brit. J. Cancer 45, 466-8, 1982). The anti-tumour efficacy is determined as the mean increase in tumour volume of the treated animals divided by the mean increase in tumour volume of the untreated animals (controls) and, after multiplication by 100, is expressed as delta T/C [%]. Tumour regression is reported as the mean changes of tumor volume of the treated animals divided by the mean tumor volume at start of treatment and, after multiplication by 100, is expressed as regression [%]. The test compound is orally administered daily with or without drug holidays.<br>
As an alternative to ceil line MIA PaCa-2, another cell line may also be used in the same manner, for example:<br>
- the 4T1 breast carcinoma cell line (ATCC Number CRL-2539; see also Cancer. 88(12 Supple), 2979-2988, 2000) with female BALB/c mice (injection into mammary fat pad).<br><br>
