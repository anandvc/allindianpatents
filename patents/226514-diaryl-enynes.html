The present invention relates to a class of diaryl-enynes, to pharmaceutical compositions<br>
containing them and to methods of treating neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders<br>
using such compounds.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Synaptic transmission is a complex form of intercellular communication that involves a<br>
considerable array of specialized structures in both the pre- and post-synaptic terminal<br>
and surrounding glial cells (Kanner and Schuldiner, CRC Critical Reviews in<br>
Biochemistry, 22,1987:1032). Transporters sequester neurotransmitter from the<br>
synapse, thereby regulating the concentration of neurotransmitter in the synapse, as well<br>
as its duration therein, which together influence the magnitude of synaptic transmission.<br>
Further, by preventing the spread of transmitter to neighbouring synapses, transporters<br>
maintain the fidelity of synaptic transmission. Lastly, by sequestering released<br>
transmitter into the presynaptic terminal, transporters allow for transmitter reutilization.<br>
Neurotransmitter transport is dependent upon extracellular sodium and the voltage<br>
difference across the membrane; under conditions of intense neuronal firing, as, for<br>
example, during a seizure, transporters can function in reverse, releasing<br>
nearotransmitter in a calcium-independent non-exocytotic manner (Attwell et al.,<br>
Neuron, 11, 1993:401-407). Pharmacologic modulation of neurotransmitter transporters<br>
thus provides a means for modifying synaptic activity, which provides useful therapy for<br>
the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disturbances.<br>
The amino acid glycine is a major neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous<br>
system, functioning at both inhibitory and excitatory synapses. By nervous system, both<br>
the central and peripheral portions of the nervous system are intended. These distinct<br>
functions of glycine are mediated by two different types of receptor, each of which is<br>
associated with a different class of glycine transporter. The inhibitory actions of elvcine<br>
are mediated by glycine receptors that are sensitive to the convulsant alkaloid strychnine,<br>
and are thus referred to as "strychnine-sensitive". Such receptors contain an intrinsic<br><br>
chloride channel that is opened upon binding of glycine to the receptor; by increasing<br>
chloride conductance, the threshold for firing of an action potential is increased.<br>
Strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors are found predominantly in the spinal cord and<br>
brainstem, and pharmacological agents that enhance the activation of such receptors will<br>
thus increase inhibitory neurotransmission in these regions.<br>
Glycine also functions in excitatory transmission by modulating the actions of glutamate,<br>
the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (Johnson and Ascher,<br>
Nature, 325, 1987:529-531; Fletcher et al, Glycine Transmission, Otterson and Storm-<br>
Mathisen, eds., 1990:193-219). Specifically, glycine is an obligatory co-agonist at the<br>
class of glutamate receptor termed N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. Activation<br>
of NMDA receptors increases sodium and calcium conductance, which depolarizes the<br>
neuron, thereby increasing the likelihood that it will fire an action potential.<br>
NMDA receptors in the hippocampal region of the brain play an important role in a<br>
model of synaptic plasticity known as long-term potentiation (LTP), which is integral in<br>
certain types of learning and memory (Hebb, D.O (1949) The Organization of Behavior;<br>
Wiley, NY; Bliss and Collingridge (1993) Nature 361: 31-39; Morris et al. (1986)<br>
Nature 319: 774-776). Enhanced expression of selected NMDA receptor sub-units in<br>
trunsgenic mice results in increased NMDA-receptor-mediated currents, enhanced LTP,<br>
ard better performance in some tests of learning and memory (Tang et al. (1999) Nature<br>
401:63).<br>
Conversely, decreased expression of selected NMDA receptor sub-units in transgenic<br>
mice produces behaviors similar to pharmacologically-induced animal models of<br>
schizophrenia, including increased locomotion, increased stereotypy, and deficits in<br>
social/sexual interactions (Mohn et al. (1999) Cell 98:427-436). These aberrant<br>
behaviors can be ameliorated using the antipsychotics haloperidol and clozapine.<br>
NMDA receptors are widely distributed throughout the brain, with a particularly high<br>
densitv in the cerebfarcbrtex and hippocampal formation.<br><br>
Molecular cloning has revealed the existence in mammalian brains two classes of glycine<br>
transporters, termed GlyT-1 and GlyT-2. GlyT-1 is found throughout the brain and<br>
spinal cord, and it has been suggested that its distribution corresponds to that of<br>
glutamatergic pathways and NMDA receptors (Smith, et al., Neuron, 8, 1992:927-935).<br>
Molecular cloning has further revealed the existence of three variants of GlyT-1, termed<br>
GlyT-1 a, GlyT-1b and GlyT-1 c. Two of these variants (1a and 1b) are found in rodents,<br>
each of which displays a unique distribution in the brain and peripheral tissues<br>
(Borowsky et al., Neuron, 10,1993:851-863; Adams et al.,J. Neuroscience, 15,<br>
1995:2524-2532). The third variant, 1c, has only been detected in human tissues (Kim,<br>
et al, Molecular Pharmacology, 45, 1994:608-617). These variants arise by differential<br>
splicing and exon usage, and differ in their N-terminal regions. GlyT-2, in contrast, is<br>
found predominantly in the brain stem and spinal cord, and its distribution corresponds<br>
closely to that of strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors {Liu et al, J. Biological<br>
Chemistry, 268, 1993:22802-22808; Jursky and Nelson, J. Neurochemistry, 64,<br>
1995:1026-1033). Another distinguishing feature of glycine transport mediated by<br>
GlyT-2 is that it is not inhibited by sarcosine as is the case for glycine transport mediated<br>
by GlyT-1. These data are consistent with the view that, by regulating the synaptic<br>
levels of glycine, GlyT-1 and GlyT-2 selectively influence the activity of NMD A<br>
receptors and strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors, respectively.<br>
Compounds which inhibit or activate glycine transporters would thus be expected to alter<br>
receptor function and, thus, provide therapeutic benefits in a variety of disease states.<br>
For example, compounds which inhibit GlyT-1 mediated glycine transport will increase<br>
glycine concentrations at NMDA receptors, which receptors are located in the forebrain,<br>
among other locations. This concentration increase elevates the activity of NMDA<br>
receptors, thereby alleviating schizophrenia and enhancing cognitive function.<br>
Alternatively, compounds that interact directly with the glycine receptor component of<br>
the NMDA receptor can have the same or similar effects as increasing or decreasing the<br>
availability of extracellular glycine caused by inhibiting or enhancing GlyT-1 activity,<br>
respectively See, for example Pitkanen et al., Eur. .J. Pha7macbl~2S3,125-129 (1?94);<br>
This it ul., Neuroscience, 46,501-509 (1992), and kretschmer and Schmidit, J.<br>
Neurosci, 16,1561-1569 (1996).<br><br>

Compounds of Formula I can be considered to be amino acids or derivatives thereof.<br>
Compounds which contain, instead of a carboxylate group, a "carboxylate equivalent"<br>
group, such as hydroxamic acids, phosphonic acids, phosphinic acids, sulfonic acids,<br>
sulfinic acids, amides or tetrazoles, are also considered embodiments of the present<br>
invention.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the compound of Formula I is provided in<br>
labeled form, such as radiolabeled form (e.g. labeled by incorporation within its structure<br>
3H or 14C or by conjugation to 125I). In a preferred aspect of the invention, such<br>
compounds, which bind preferentially to GlyT-1, can be used to identify GlyT-1 receptor<br>
ligands by techniques common in the art. This can be achieved by incubating the<br>
receptor or tissue in the presence of a ligand candidate and then incubating the resulting<br>
preparation with an equimolar amount of radiolabeled compound of the invention.<br>
GlyT-1 receptor ligands are thus revealed as those that significantly occupy the GlyT-1<br>
site and prevent binding of the radiolabeled compound of the present invention.<br>
Alternatively, GlyT-1 receptor ligand candidates may be identified by first incubating a<br>
radiolabeled form of a compound of the invention then incubating the resulting<br>
preparation in the presence of the candidate ligand. A more potent GlyT-1 receptor<br>
ligand will, at equimolar concentration, displace the radiolabeled compound of the<br>
invention.<br>
Acid addition salts of the compounds of Formula I are most suitably formed from<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable acids, and include for example those formed with inorganic<br>
acids e.g. hydrochloric, sulphuric or phosphoric acids and organic acids e.g. succinic,<br>
maleic, acetic or fumaric acid. Other non-pharmaceutically acceptable salts e.g. oxalates<br>
may be used for example in the isolation of compounds of Formula I for laboratory use,<br>
or for subsequent-conversion to a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt. Also<br>
included within the scope of the ivention are base addition salts (such as sodium,<br><br>
potassium and ammonium salts), solvates and hydrates of compounds of the invention.<br>
Base salts are preferred and sodium and potassium salts are especially preferred.<br>
The conversion of a given compound salt to a desired compound salt is achieved by<br>
applying standard techniques, well known to one skilled in the art.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be prepared by processes analogous to those<br>
established in the art. For example, compounds of Formula I are readily prepared by the<br>
method shown in Scheme 1, below. Intermediate C was prepared according to the<br>
method of Trost (Trost, B. M.; Sorum, M. T.; Chan, C; Harms, A. E.; Ruther, G. J. Am.<br>
Chem. Soc. 1997,119, 698-708 ; Trost, B. M.; Hachiya, I.; Mclntosh, M. C. Tetrahedron<br>
Lett. 1998, 39, 6445-6448) by coupling an arylpropiolic ester such as A with<br>
trimethylsilylacetylene B in the presence of palladium acetate and tris(2,6-<br>
dimethoxyphenyl)phosphine. Reduction of the ester to the alcohol, and treatment with<br>
N-3romosuccinimide gave bromide D. Treatment of D with a sarcosine ester (such as<br>
tbutyl sarcosine) in the presence of base gave the intermediate sarcosine derivative E.<br>
Removal of the trimethylsilyl group (for example, by treatment with potassium carbonate<br>
in methanol), followed by introduction of the second aryl group by a Sonogashira<br>
coupling (Sonogashira, K.; Yohda, Y. and Hagihara, N.; Tetrahedron Lett., 1975, 4467),<br>
gave the diaryl species G which, upon deprotection with, for example, formic acid, gave<br>
the final product //.<br>
This route is an attractive one for the parallel synthesis of a series of related compounds<br>
in which group Ar2 is constant, but group Ar1 represents a number of different aryl<br>
groups. Common intermediate F can be prepared in bulk, and simply treated with the<br>
appropriate aryliodide under Sonogashira conditions to yield the desired products.<br><br><br>
Alternatively, such compounds may also be prepared according to the route shown in<br>
Scheme 2, below. This route complements that shown above, in that it allows the<br>
parallel synthesis of a series of related compounds in which group Ar1 is constant, but<br>
group Ar2 represents a number of different aryl groups. In this case, common<br>
intermediate L can be prepared in bulk, and simply treated with the appropriate<br>
arylprdpiolic ester O (readily accessible from aryliodide M by treatment with propiolic<br>
ester N in the presence of Cul and Pd(PPh3)4), under the conditions outlined above, to<br>
yield, after deprotection, products H.<br><br><br>
To prepare compounds in which Ar1 is Aryl-substituted phenyl (Ar3-phenyl), the<br>
following synthesis (Scheme 3) is useful. Intermediate F can be prepared according to<br>
Scacme 1, then coupled to bromoiodobenzene via Sonogashira coupling to yield species<br>
S. The arylbromide of species S can then be reacted with a boronic acid (Ar3-boronic<br>
acid) under Suzuki coupling conditions to give intermediate G'. (G' is equivalent to G,<br>
Scheme 1, Where Ar1 is Ar3 phenyl). G' can then be deprotected as in Scheme 1 to give<br><br><br>
Compounds which inhibit GlyT-1 mediated glycine transport will increase glycine<br>
concentrations at NMDA receptors, which receptors are located in the forebrain, among<br>
other locations. This concentration increase elevates the activity of NMDA receptors,<br>
thereby alleviating schizophrenia and enhancing cognitive function. Alternatively,<br>
compounds that interact directly with the glycine receptor component of the NMDA<br>
receptor can have the same or similar effects as increasing or decreasing the availability<br>
of extracellular glycine caused by inhibiting or enhancing GlyT-1 activity, respectively.<br>

"The compounds of the invention are, for instance, administered orally, sublingually,<br>
rectally, nasaJly, vaginally, topically (including the use of a patch or other transdermal<br><br>
delivery device), by pulmonary route by use of an aerosol, or parenterally, including, for<br>
example, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intraperitoneally, intraarterially,<br>
intravenously or intrathecally. Administration can be by means of a pump for periodic or<br>
continuous delivery. The compounds of the invention are administered alone, or are<br>
combined with a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier or excipient according to standard<br>
pharmaceutical practice. For the oral mode of administration, the compounds of the<br>
invention are used in the form of tablets, capsules, lozenges, chewing gum, troches,<br>
powders, syrups, elixirs, aqueous solutions and suspensions, and the like. In the case of<br>
tablets, carriers that are used include lactose, sodium citrate and salts of phosphoric acid.<br>
Various disintegrants such as starch, and lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate<br>
and talc, are commonly used in tablets. For oral administration in capsule form, useful<br>
cPiluents are lactose and high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. If desired, certain<br>
sweetening and/or flavoring agents are added. For parenteral administration, sterile<br>
solutions of the compounds of the invention are usually prepared, and the pHs of the<br>
solutions are suitably adjusted and buffered. For intravenous use, the total concentration<br>
of solutes should be controlled to render the preparation isotonic. For ocular<br>
administration, ointments or droppable liquids may be delivered by ocular delivery<br>
systems known to the art such as applicators or eye droppers. Such compositions can<br>
include mucomimetics such as hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate, hydroxypropyl<br>
mothylcellulose or polyvinyl alcohol, preservatives such as sorbic acid, EDTA or<br>
beazylchromium chloride, and the usual quantities of diluents and/or carriers. For<br>
pulmonary administration, diluents and/or carriers will be selected to be appropriate to<br>
allow the formation of an aerosol.<br>
Suppository forms of the compounds of the invention are useful for vaginal, urethral and<br>
rectal administrations. Such suppositories will generally be constructed of a mixture of<br>
substances that is solid at room temperature but melts at body temperature. The<br>
substances commonly used to create such vehicles include theobroma oil, glycerinated<br>
gelatin, hydrogenated vegetable oils, mixtures of polyethylene glycols of various<br>
molecular weight and fatty acid esters of polyethylene glycol. See, Remington's<br>

Numerous administration vehicles will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art,<br>
including without limitation slow release formulations, liposomal formulations and<br>
polymeric matrices.<br>
Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts for use in the present<br>
invention include those derived from mineral acids, such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic,<br>
phosphoric, metaphosphoric, nitric and sulfuric acids, and organic acids, such as tartaric,<br>
acetic, citric, malic, lactic, fumaric, benzoic, glycolic, gluconic, succinic, p-<br>
toluenesulphonic and arylsulphonic acids, for example. Examples of pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable base addition salts for use in the present invention include those derived from<br>
non-toxic metals such as sodium or potassium, ammonium salts and organoamino salts<br>
such as triethylamine salts. Numerous appropriate such salts will be known to those of<br>

The physician or other health care professional can select the appropriate dose and<br>
treatment regimen based on the subject's weight, age, and physical condition. Dosages<br>
will generally be selected to maintain a serum level of compounds of the invention<br>
between about 0.01 g/cc and about 1000 g/cc, preferably between about 0.1 g/cc and<br>
about 100 g/cc. For parenteral administration, an alternative measure of preferred<br>
amount is from about 0.001 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg (alternatively, from about 0.01<br>
mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg), more preferably from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 1 mg/kg<br>
(from about 0.1 mg/kg to about 1 mg/kg), will be administered. For oral administrations,<br>
an alternative measure of preferred administration amount is from about 0.001 mg/kg to<br>
about 10 mg/kg (from about 0.1 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg), more preferably from about<br>
0.01 mg/kg to about 1 mg/kg (from about 0.1 mg/kg to about 1 mg/kg). For<br>

For use in assaying for activity in inhibiting glycine transport, eukaryokic cells,<br>
preferably QT-6 cells derived from quail fibroblasts, have been transfected to express<br><br>
one of the three known variants of human GlyT-1, namely GlyT-la, GlyT-lb or GlyT-<br>
1c, or human GlyT-2. The sequences of these GlyT-1 transporters are described in Kim<br>
et al., Molec. Pharm. 45: 608-617, 1994, excepting that the sequence encoding the<br>
extreme N-terminal of GlyT-1a was merely inferred from the corresponding rat-derived<br>
sequence. This N-terminal protein-encoding sequence has now been confirmed to<br>
correspond to that inferred by Kim et al. The sequence of the human GlyT-2 is described<br>
by Albert et al., U.S. Application No. 08/700,013, filed August 20, 1996, which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Suitable expression vectors include<br>

Example 20 - Assay of Transport via GIyT-1<br>
This example illustrates a method for the measurement of glycine uptake by transfected<br>
cultured cells.<br>
Cells stably transfected with GlyT-lC (see Kim, et al, Molecular Pharmacology, 45,<br>
1994:608-617) were washed twice with HEPES buffered saline (HBS). The cells were<br>
then incubated 10 minutes at 37 C, after which a solution was added containing 50 nM<br>
[H]glycine (17.5 Ci/mmol) and either (a) no potential competitor, (b) 10 mM<br>
nonradioactive glycine or (c) a concentration of a candidate drug. A range of<br>
concentrations of the candidate drug waslised togenerate data for calculating the<br>
concentration resulting in 50% of the effect (e.g., the IC50s, which are the concentrations<br><br>
of drug inhibiting glycine uptake by 50%). The cells were then incubated another 10<br>
minutes at 37°C, after which the cells were aspirated and washed three times with ice-<br>
cold HBS. The cells were harvested, scintillant was added to the cells, the cells were<br>
shaken for 30 minutes, and the radioactivity in the cells was counted using a scintillation<br>
counter. Data were compared between the same cells contacted or not contacted by a<br>
candidate agent, depending on the assay being conducted.<br>
The compounds of the present invention were active as GlyT-1 inhibitors.<br>
Example 21 - Assay of Binding to NMDA Receptors<br>
This example illustrates binding assays to measure interaction of compounds with the<br>
glycine site on the NMDA receptor.<br>
Direct binding of [3H]glycine to the NMDA-glycine site was performed according to the<br>
method of Grimwood et ah, Molecular Pharmacology, 41, 923-930 (1992); Yoneda et<br>
al.,y. Neurochem, 62, 102-112 (1994).<br>
The binding test was performed in eppendorf tubes containing 150 ug of membrane<br>
protein and 50 nM [JH]glycine in a volume of 0.5 ml. Non-specific binding was<br>
determined with 1 mM glycine. Drugs were dissolved in assay buffer (50 mM Tris-<br>
zcetate, pH 7.4) or DMSO (final concentration of 0.1%). Membranes were incubated on<br>
ice for 30 minutes and bound radioligand was separated from free radioligand by<br>
filtration on Whatman GF/B glass fiber filters or by centrifugation (18,000 x g, 20 min).<br>
Filters or pellet was washed three times quickly with ice-cold 5 mM Tris-acetate buffer.<br>
Filters were dried and placed in scintillation tubes and counted. Pellets were dissolved in<br>
deoxycholate/NaOH (0.1 N) solution overnight, neutralized and radioactivity was<br>
determined by scintillation counting.<br>
A second binding test for the NMDA-glycine site used [3H]dichlorokynurenic acid-<br>
(DCKA) and membranes prepared as above. See, Yoneda et al., J. Neurochem., 60,634-<br>
645 (1993). The binding assay was performed as described for [3H]gly cine above .except<br>
that [3H]DCKA was used to label the glycine site. The final concentration of [3H]DCKA<br>
was 10 nM, and the assay was performed for 10 minutes on ice.<br><br>
A third binding test used for the NMDA-glycine site used indirect assessment of affinity<br>
of ligands for the site by measuring the binding of [3H]MK-801 (dizocilpine). See,<br>
Palmer and Burns, J. Neurochem., 62,187-196 (1994). Preparation of membranes for<br>
the test was the same as above. The binding assay allowed separate detection of<br>
antagonists and agonists.<br>
The third binding test was operated to identify antagonists as follows: 100 ug of<br>
membranes were added to wells of a 96-well plate, along with glutamate (10 M) and<br>
glycine (200 nM) and various concentrations of the ligand to be tested. The assay was<br>
started by the addition of 5 nM [3H]MK-801 (23.9 Ci/mmol), which binds to the ion<br>
channel associated with NMDA receptors. The final volume of the assay was 200 l.<br>
The assay was performed for 1 hour at room temperature. Bound radioactivity was<br>
separated from free by filtration, using a TOMTEC harvester. Antagonist activity was<br>
. ndicated by decreasing radioactivity associated with the NMDA receptor with<br>
increasing concentration of the tested ligand.<br>
The third binding test was operated to identify agonists by performing the test as above,<br>
except that the concentration of glycine was 200 nM. Agonist activity was indicated by<br>
increasing radioactivity associated with the NMDA receptor with increasing<br>
concentration of the tested ligand.<br><br>
