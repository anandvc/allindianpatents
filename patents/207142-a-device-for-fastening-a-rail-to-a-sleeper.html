BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS.<br>
The invention will now be briefly described with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein-Fig. 1. and 4 show sectional views of two special liners for the rail fastening device of the present invention;<br>
4<br><br>
fig.lA is a plan view of Fig.l and show one type of liner .<br>
Fig.2 and 5 show the rail fastening system in sectional view;<br>
Fig.2A is a plan view of Fig.2;<br>
Fig. 3 shows sectional view of a shoulder for the rail fastening system; and<br>
Figs. 3A and 3B respectively show plan view and side view of the shoulder<br>
of Figure 3.<br>
Fig.4A is a plan view of Fig 4 and show another type of liner.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS.<br>
As will be clear from the drawings of Fig.2 and 2A, there is provided a liner L as shown in Figures 1 and 1A. This liner L comprises toe-resting portion 1, a heel -resting portion 2 and a curved portion 3 joining the toe-resting and heel-resting portion 1 and 2 respectively a recess 5 being formed beneath the curved portion 3. The toe- resting portion 1 is inclined at an angle 'a' to the horizontal so that the angle is same as the angle of the top or rail foot.<br>
The lowest point 4 of the toe-resting portion is always above, by about 1 to 2 mm or more at the rail edge taking reference from Fig. 1 A, and 3A portions 1 and 2 of the liner may or may not have length L3 equal to length L. as that of shoulder which will be described later. Portion 3 of the liner has a length L2 which is marginally less than the length L1 of the recess in the middle of the shoulder shown in Fig.3B. The length L2 is preferably 1-2 mm less than length L1 of the recess in the middle of the shoulder.<br>
The toe-resting portion (1), the heel-resting portion (2) and the highest point inside curved portion (3) have relative heights to provide for designed toe load of a clip into the assembly with the shoulder of Fig.3.<br>
The liner may be made of malleable cast iron or SG iron or steel or glass-filed nylon as per requirement.<br>
5<br><br>
The shoulder shown in Fig.3, 3A and 3B may be made of malleable cast iron SG iron or steel Fig.3 shows the sectional view of the shoulder S. If can be seen from Fig.3,3A that it has a recess 8 of length L between the two arms 6 and 7 of the shoulder. The apex of the recess is according to the design requirement of the clip for designed toe load. The shoulder has also another recess 9 on the outer periphery of length Li between two faces 10 and 11.<br>
The assembly of the liner and shoulder with the rail clip on a rail sleeper with rail is shown in Fig.2 and 2A.<br>
In its second embodiment, the special liner (Fig.4, 4A) has the toe-resting portion (1); the heel-resting portion (2), the curved portion (3) connecting the portions (1) and (2) and also disposed above the outer periphery of shoulder of Fig.3, 3A and partially into its recess 9. The toe-resting portion (1) over rides the flange of the ail with a gap between the rail and toe-resting portion, as in the First embodiment of the special liner . The heel resting portion 2 rests on sleeper top. Over and above the above features, the second embodiment has stem (12) as in Fig. 4 which protrudes below the point 4 and rests on the top surface level of the sleeper or the base plate fixed to the sleeper. The stem (12) has an advantage that it renders the toe-resting (4) strengthen comparatively more than the first embodiment and its section can be reduced in case of necessity and with advantage that it also facilitates use of different rail sections on the same base plate design.<br>
Partial rail seat assembly with the above embodiment of the special liner is as per Fig.(5) and the usage of elastic rail clip with special liner does not render pressure on rail foot and the pressure is transmitted to the sleeper through stem (12).<br>
It will be seen that the device used for fastening the rail to the sleeper essentially comprises of three components, namely, (1) a Liner (2) a shoulder and (3) a rail fastening clip.<br>
Fig.2 clearly shows as to how the rail is fastened to the sleeper using the novel liner, novel shoulder and a conventional fastening clip.<br>
In Figure 2 there is shown a rail R having its foot-seated on the top ST of a sleeper SL. It can be seen that top of the foot F is extending at an angle equivalent to angle   a of the liner (Fig.l) on each side of rail of the<br>
6<br><br>
web W of the rail R. A clip C is mounted on the sleeper with liner (L) and shoulder S interposed between the clip, sleeper and the top of rail foot F on each side of the rail web W. The heel resting portion 2 of liner L rests on the sleeper SL while the toe-resting portion 1 over rides the rail foot F of the rail R. The shoulder S bridges the gap in the curved portion 3 (Fig.l) and a leg C3 of the clip C passes through the recess 8 in the shoulder S (Fig.3). The clip has a toe portion Cl resting on the toe-resting portion 1 of the liner. The heel portion C2 of the clip C rests on the heel-resting portion 2 of the liner. The clip C is driven into the Rail sleeper assembly so that the toe portion Cl grips the rail foot F through the toe-resting portion 1 of the liner and the heel portion C2 grips the sleeper SL through the heel resting portion 2 of the liner.<br>
When the clip is fitted into the assembly, the liner does not move longitudinally due to recess 9 in the shoulder and it is vertically stable due to loads of the clip and portions (1) and (2) of the liner. After fitting of the clip, the bottom face of the heel-resting portion (2) of the liner is in touch with the sleeper top and there is a gap between the face of the toe-resting portion (1) of the liner and the top of rail foot. The system keeps the rail free from pressure of the clip on the rail foot though it is fitted as in general use of the Elastic Fastening system in the track.<br>
The specially designed ' Liner-SP' is continued from the heel shoulder into the recess in the shoulder and then continued on to the rail foot with a gap of 1-2 mm between the liner and the rail foot for permitting rail movement. The clip being elastic in nature, absorbs the vibrations and does not fall off during service.<br>
When the clip is driven into the housing due to force of driving mechanism, the 'Liner-SP has a tendency to slide in the direction of driving force. The wall portion of recess 9 in FIG.3B does not permitr its movement while the vertical stability to the liner is provided by the toe and heel portions Cl and C2 of the elastic rail clip itself.<br>
SPECIAL ASPECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
What is important to note is that the fastening device uses mainly elastic rail clip widely known for their use in railway track. For anchoring<br>
7<br><br>
such clips in the assembly of rail and sleeper on a bridge, a special housing for the clip C and a special liner L referred to here as   Liner-SP' is designed which puts the clip C into action and still does not put restraint on the rail against its longitudinal movement due to temperature variation and due to other effects. T he combined salient features of the 'Shoulder' S and Liner-SP'L is that the 'Liner-SP' does not slip/move in the direction of length of the rail while driving the clip with the stroke of a hammer Or a specially designed tool, for driving the clip into its housing. For this purpose, the invention lies in the fact that the shoulder, an embodiment of the base plate in cases with the steel/wooden sleeper and concrete sleeper bed, and built-in with cast shoulder in case of concrete sleeper, has a recess marginally deep in its middle part length.<br>
The specially designed 'Liner-SP' is continued from the heel shoulder into the recess in the shoulder and then continued on to the rail foot with a gap of 1-2 mm or more between the liner and the rail foot for permitting rail movement. The clip being elastic in nature absorbs the vibrations and does not fall off during service.<br>
The system absorbs vibrations and there is no fear for the fastening to loosen.<br>
Lesser number of components are used in the assembly. Therefore, reduction in inventry of stock is achieved.<br>
The fastener clip is same as in use in approach track to the bridge. Therefore, there is no additional inventry.<br>
The system does not exert force on rail; thus free movement of rail is achieved and is useful on existing bridge structures in particular.<br>
The system can be used on any type of foundation /sleeper with suitably designed bearing plate shoulder. On concrete sleeper it may be used with or without bearing plate with suitably designed shoulders.<br><br>
