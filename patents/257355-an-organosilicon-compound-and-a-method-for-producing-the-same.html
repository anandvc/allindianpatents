ORGANOSILICON COMPOUNDS THAT CONTAIN B-KETOAMIDE GROUPS<br>
AND ORGANIC POLYMERS BOUND VIA ENAMINE BONDS, AND<br>
METHOD FOR PRODUCING THEM<br>
The invention relates to organosilicon compounds which contain 3-ketoamide groups and organic polymers bound via enamine bonds, and methods for producing them.<br>
US 6121404 describes siloxanes which contain polyether chains and acetoacetate groups in a molecule. These polymers are obtained by hydrosilylation of unsaturated polyethers with hydrogensiloxanes and subsequent reaction of the intermediate with diketene or the active derivatives thereof. According to this method, owing to the partial rearrangement of allylpolyethers to give propenyl isomers, it is necessary to use a correspondingly large excess, which cannot be removed. This excess, too, is reacted with diketene and then also contains the acetoacetate group but is not bound to the siloxane. Expensive noble metal catalysts are required for the hydrosilylation. Furthermore the acetoacetate groups are not bound directly to the siloxane in the main product but form the terminal groups of the polyethers added beforehand.<br>
Methods for reacting polymeric compounds, such as polyethers, polyacetates, polyetheracetals, polyesters or polyesterpolyols, with diketene or acetoacetates are disclosed in GB 1154726 and GB 1218509. The polymers used contain at least one carbinol group and the products accordingly contain at least one acetoacetyl group.<br>
It was therefore the object to provide organosilicon compounds which have both a hydrophilic organic radical and p-ketoamide groups and can be prepared via a simple method,  it being intended to avoid the disadvantages<br><br>
described  above.  The  object  is  achieved  by  the<br>
invention.<br>
The invention relates to organosilicon compounds (1) which contain at least one Si-bonded radical of the general formula<br><br>
in which-<br>
-(Si=) is the bond to the silicon atom,<br>
R1   is a divalent organic radical having 1 to 6 carbon<br>
atoms,  which may  optionally  contain  nitrogen  atoms<br>

hydrocarbon radical having 1 to 6 C atoms which may<br>
optionally contain one or more nitrogen atoms separate<br>
from one another,<br>

to  30  C  atoms,  preferably  a  hydrogen  atom  or<br>

Z    is a divalent to hexavalent organic radical having<br>
a monomeric, oligomeric or polymeric structure, which<br>
has a heteroatom content of at least 10% by weight and<br>
is bonded via C atoms,<br>
E1   is a monofunctional terminal group or an Si-C-<br>
bonded radical of the general formula<br><br><br>
a    is an integer from 1 to 5, preferably 1 or 2, and x    is 0 or an integer from 1 to 5, preferably 0 or 1, preferably 1.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to a method for producing organosilicon compounds (1) which contain at least one Si-bonded radical of the general formula<br><br>
in which<br>
R1,  R2,  R3, R4,     Y, Z,     E1,  a and x have the meanings<br>
stated above therefor,<br>
in which, in a first stage,<br>
aminosilicon compounds (2) which contain at least one<br>
Si-Obonded amino group £ of the general formula<br><br>
are reacted with compounds (3), which contain at least one p-ketocarbonyl functional radical, of the general formula<br><br>
organosilicon compounds (1') of the general formula<br><br>
being obtained, in which<br><br>
R1, R2, R3, R4, Y, Z, a and x have the meanings stated above therefor, and<br>
E2   is a monofunctional terminal group or a radical of<br>
the general formula -Y-C (O) -CR4-C (CH2R4) -OH or -Y-C(0)-<br>

stage are reacted with diketenes  (4)  of the general<br>
formula<br>
  (IV)<br>
in which<br>
R4   has the meanings stated above therefor.<br>
In the method according to the invention, the aminosilicon compounds (2) are reacted in a first stage with acetoacetyl compounds (3) of the tautomeric forms (Ilia) or (Illb) and, in a subsequent second stage, are reacted with diketenes (4). This reaction sequence can advantageously be carried out in a one-pot process. A particularly preferred procedure is the upstream preparation of compounds (3) from the underlying base compounds (5) by reaction of these with diketenes (4), after which aminosilicon compounds (2) are metered in at the end of the reaction and, by further metering of diketenes (4) after the reaction thereof, the organosilicon compounds (1) according to the invention are then obtained in a particularly economical method.<br>
Preferred examples for 3i-C-bonded amino groups A of<br>
the formula (II) are<br>
H2N-C2H4-NH-CH2-H2N-C3H6-NH-CH2-H2N-C3H6-NH-C3H6-NH-CH2-<br><br>
H2N-C2H4-NH-C3He-<br>
H2N-C3H6-NH-C3H6-<br>
H2N-C2H4-NH-C2H4-NH-C3H6-<br>
H2N-C3H6-NH-C3H6-NH-C3H6-<br>
H2N-C2H4-NH-C4HB-<br>
R2 is preferably a hydrogen atom.<br>
R3  is  particularly  preferably  an  alkylene  radical<br>
having 2 to 6 carbon atoms.<br>
R^   is preferably a hydrogen atom.<br>
Z preferably has a heteroatom content of at least 20% by weight and particularly preferably at least 25% by<br>
weight.<br>
Aminosilicon compounds (2) are preferably organopolysiloxanes  having  at  least  one  Si-C-bonded<br>
radical A of the formula (II).<br>
Preferred aminosilicon compounds (2) are organopolysiloxanes of the general formula<br>
AgR3-gSiO(SiR20) x (SiRAO) kSiR3-gAg      (V) ,<br>
in which A has the meaning stated above therefor,<br>
R is a monovalent hydrocarbon radical having 1 to 18 C<br>
atoms,<br>
g   is 0 or 1,<br>
k   is 0 or an integer from 1 to 30 and<br>
1    is 0 or an integer from 1 to 1000,<br>
with the proviso that at least one radical A per<br>
molecule is present.<br>
Preferred aminosilicon compounds (2) contain amine group concentrations in the range from 0.01 to about 10 msquiv./g, in particular from about 0.05 to 5 mequiv./g.  Preferred viscosities are in the range<br><br>
from about 100 to 50000 mPa•s at 25°C, the range 500 to 10000 mPa-s at 25°C being particularly preferred.<br>
Aminosilicon compounds (2) are preferably used without prior conversion of the amino groups by means of protective group reagents, such as aldehydes or ketones.<br>
The aminosilicon compounds (2) are preferably produced from "diamino" monomers, such as aminoethylaminopropyl-or aminoethylaminoisobutylsi lanes, the Si-C-bonded amino group A containing both a primary and a secondary amine radical, bonded to the same Si atom. In the radicals A, the primary amine radicals react preferentially with the compounds (3) , the secondary amine radicals being retained as basic centers.<br>
The compounds (3) can be used as react ants for the aminosilicon compound (2) in two tautomeric forms of the formulae (Ilia) and (Illb).<br>
The compounds {3) are preferably obtained by reacting the underlying base compounds (5) of the formula (E2) XZ-Y (VI), which are saturated with hydrogen at the free valencies,<br>
E2, Z and Y having the meaning stated above therefor, with the diketenes, acetylketenes, alkyldiketenes, diketene-acetone adducts or acetoacetates, preferably with diketenes or the acetone adducts thereof, by methods known in the literature.<br>
The radical "Z" is defined as an organic radical which, owing to its bifunctionality to hexafunctionality, is bonded with 2 to 6 further groups E or Y: the sum of "E" plus "Y" corresponds in its numerical value to this bifunctionality to hexafunctionality. In the simplest case, which is also preferred, "Z" is bifunctional, i.e. divalent. In this case, "Z" is bonded either to<br><br>
two Y groups or to one Y group and one mono functional terminal group. Monofunctional terminal groups may be saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon radicals having 1 to 18 C atoms or acyl radicals, such as the acetate, butyrate, palmitate or stearate radical, as well as the acrylate, methacrylate or benzoate radical.<br>
The radical "Z" has a heteroatom content of at least 10% by weight. Heteroatoms are selected from the group consisting of 0, N, B, P and S atoms, preferably 0 and N atoms, particularly preferably 0 atoms. The radical "Z" has the function of introducing higher polarity and hence a higher degree of hydrophilicity into the organosilicon compounds i1j according to the invention, and it is for this reason that a higher content of heteroatoms is preferred. The radical "Z" is particularly preferably a polyether or polyester. Examples of polyethers are polyethylene oxide, polypropylene oxide cr polybutylene oxide (also poly-THF) and also copolymers of the general formula (CaH2aO) nCaH2a, where a = 2, 3 or 4 and n is an integer from 1 to 500, preferably 1 to 100 and particularly preferably 5 to 60.<br>
Trifunctional to hexafunctional radicals nZ" are usually started from alcohols having the same functionality as well as from amines. Thus, trimethylolpropane 'be ammonia together with ethylene oxide gives base compounds (5) with "Z" of the general formula C2H5C [CH2 (OC2H4) m/3.n 3 or N [C2H4 (OC2H4) (m_it/3] a, where m is the total number of moles of ethylene oxide, preferably from 5 to 100, the free valencies of which are bonded to oxygen atoms (Y) , which in turn are saturated with hydrogen. For the preparation of base compounds (5) having a higher functionality, the correspondingly more hig.nly functionalized carbinol or amino compounds are usually used: tetrafunctionality from     pentaerythrito]      or     ethylenediamine,<br><br>
hexafunctionality from sorbitol or tris(arainoethyl)amine.<br>
Corresponding polyesters can be prepared from identical or similar starter compounds by ring-opening polymerization of cyclic esters (lactones) by generally known methods. Preferred base compounds (5) are polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol and the copolymers thereof and the monoalkyl ethers thereof. The latter constitute a special case where "Y" is oxygen and "E" is an alkyl group (methyl, butyl) , Regarding the conversion into compounds (3) , these base compounds (5) are monofunctional. Compared with the aminosilicon compounds {2}, the compounds (3) produced therefrom are also monofunctional and accordingly serve for saturating amino groups with polar polymers.<br>
In contrast, bifunctional reactants (3) , which have a chain-extending action with respect to likewise bifunctional aminosilicon compounds (2), i.e. which contain two amino groups A per molecule, are obtained from polyalkylene glycols. In this way, it is also possible to obtain branched products (1), provided that the aminosilicon compounds (2) contain at least three amino groups A per molecule. An alternating siloxane-polyether structure forms.<br>
The surprisingly high selectivity of the compounds (3) with primary amine radicals in the amino groups A of the aminosilicon compounds (2) permits virtually complete conversion of the H2N radicals into enamines, and it is for this reason that a stoichiometric ratio of primary NH2 radicals in amino groups A of compounds (2) to acetoacetyl groups in compounds (3) close to 1.0, preferably between 0.8 to 1.0, is used in the first stage of the method according to the invention. However, it may  also be above 1.0. In  this case,  not<br><br>
all primary amine radica]s are reacted, which, however, are then additionally available for reaction with diketenes (4). Although this procedure is technically possible, it is not preferred.<br>
In the method according to the invention, the acetone adducts of diketenes (A) can also be used as said diketenes. Preferably used diketenes (4) are<br>
  or the acetone adducts thereof.<br>
In the method according to the invention, the stoichiometric ratio of secondary -NH groups in amino groups A of compounds (2) to diketenes (4) is from 5:1 to 0.5:1, preferably from 2:1 to 0.8:1, in the subsequent reaction with diketenes (4). A ratio of about 1:1 is particularly preferred.<br>
The method according to the invention can be effected in the presence of organic solvents or the products (1) according to the invention can be diluted with organic solvents.<br>
The reaction of the compounds (3) with aminosilicon compounds (2) in the first stage of the method according to the invention takes place spontaneously even without external heating, but supply of heat accelerates the synthesis of (1).<br>
The method according tc the invention is preferably carried out at temperatures of from 10 to 100°C, preferably from 40. to 80°C. Furthermore, the method according to the invention is preferably carried out at the pressure of the ambient atmosphere but can also be carried out at higher and lower pressures.<br><br>
Example 1:<br>
411 g of an acetoacetylpolyether, prepared from a monofunctional polyether of the formula C4H9O (C2H4O) 18.0 (C3H60) 17.^H and diketene, having an acetoacetyl concentration of 0.51 mequiv./g, are mixed with 250 g of a copolymer comprising aminoethylaminopropyl methylsiloxane units and dimethylsiloxane units and having a viscosity of 830 mm2/s (25°C) and an amine number of 1.597 and are heated to 7 0 °C with stirring. Thus, a stoichiometry of H2N/acetoacetyl of 0.95 is established. The very turbid mixture clears after abojt 20 minutes. Pulsed reaction for two hours at the same temperature leads to a considerable increase in viscosity, which is considerably moderated by addition of 70 g of isopropanol. Metering in of 16.8 g of diketene immediately leads to a substantially exothermic reaction with further increase in viscosity. A further 156 g of isopropanol are added and slowly stirred in. A 75% strength solution of a silicone polymer which contains polyether chai.ns grafted via enamine and simultaneously also &amp;-ketoamido groups is obtained. The solution contains 0.22 mequiv. of these groups per g. The polymer solution is miscible with water to give a clear solution.<br>
Example 2:<br>
116 g of a PEG-1000 bis(acetoacetate) having an average molecular weight of 1106 g are melted at 70°C. At the same temperature, 263 g of an a,o-bis(aminoethylaminopropyl)dimethylpolysiloxane are metered in. The viscosity of the mixture increases considerably and the mixture clears. After a further 3 hours ai 7 0°C, 8.4 g of diketene are metered in, whereupon a further increase in viscosity follows in an exothermic reaction.  After cooling,  a highly viscose<br><br>
oil having an acetoacetamide content of 0.26 mequiv./g and the same concentration of acetoacetate groups from the polyether excess used is obtained. An 80% strength solution of the polymer in butyldiglycol can be dispersed in the same amount of water without relatively strong shearing.<br><br><br><br>
