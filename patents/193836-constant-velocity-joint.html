The present invention relates to a constant velocity joint having 8 torque transmitting balls.<br>
Constant velocity joints are classified roughly into the fixed type allowing only angular displacement between two axes and the plunging type allowing angular displacement and axial displacement between two axes.  One of the features of the fixed type constant velocity joint, as compared with the plunging type, is that it is capable of taking a high operating angle.  For example, the fixed type constant velocity joint used in the drive shaft of an automobile is required to have a maximum operating angle of, e.g., 45Â° or more; however, such high operating angle can be provided only by the fixed type.  On the other hand, the fixed type constant velocity joint, as compared with the plunging type, inevitably has its internal construction somewhat complicated.<br>
Figs. 23A and 23B show a Zepper type constant velocity joint typical of the fixed type constant velocity joint. This constant velocity joint comprises an outer joint member 11 having a spherical inner surface 11a axially formed with 6 curved guide grooves lib, an inner joint member 12 having a spherical outer surface 12a axially formed with 6 curved guide grooves 12b and an inner<br><br>
surface formed with serrations (or splines) 12c for connection to a shaft, 6 torque transmitting balls 13 disposed in ball tracks defined between the guide grooves lib and 12b of the outer and inner joint members 11 and 12, respectively", and a cage 14 for retaining the torque transmitting balls 13.<br>
The centers A and B of the guide grooves lib and 12b of the outer and inner joint members 11 and 12, respectively, are offset with respect to the spherical centers of the inner and outer surfaces 11a and 12a, respectively, by an equal distance in opposite directions (the guide groove center A is offset toward the open side of the joint, and the guide groove center B toward the innermost side of the joint).  As a result, the ball track defined between the guide groove lib and the guide groove 12b corresponding thereto is wedge-wise enlarged toward the open side of the joint.  The spherical centers of the inner and outer surfaces 11a and 12a of the outer and inner joint members 11 and 12 are located in the joint center plane O including the centers of the torque transmitting balls 13.<br>
When the outer and inner joint members 11 and 12 make an angular displacement of angle 0, the torque transmitting balls 13 guided by the cage 14 are maintained in the bisector plane (9   /   2) bisecting the angle 0 irrespective of the value of the operating angle 0,   and hence uniform velocity is secured.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to make this type of constant velocity joint more compact and secure the strength, load capacity and durability which are at least equal to those in a comparative article (such as a 6-ball constant velocity joint as shown in Fig. 23).<br>
To achieve the above object, the invention provides a constant velocity ball joint comprising an outer joint member having a plurality of axially extending curved guide grooves formed in the spherical inner surface thereof, an inner joint member having a plurality of axially extending curved guide grooves formed in the spherical outer surface thereof, a plurality of ball tracks defined between the guide grooves of the outer joint member and the guide grooves of the inner joint member corresponding thereto, said ball tracks being enlarged in one sense of the axial direction, a torque transmitting ball disposed in each of the plurality of ball tracks, a cage having a plurality of pockets for storing the torque transmitting balls, said constant velocity joint being characterized in that the number of said ball tracks and the number of said torque transmitting balls disposed are eight.<br>
The ratio rl (= PCDBALL / DBALL) of the pitch circle diameter (PCDBALL) of the torque transmitting balls to the diameter (DBALL.) of said torque transmitting balls may be within the range 3.3 i rl 
 <br>
length of a line segment connecting the centers of the guide grooves of the outer or inner joint member and the centers of the torque transmitting balls (the length of a line segment connecting the centers of the guide grooves of the outer joint member and the centers of the torque transmitting balls and the length of a line segment connecting the centers of the guide grooves of the inner joint member and the centers of the torque transmitting balls are equal), whereby the nature of constant velocity of the joint is secured, said length being hereinafter referred to as <pcr thus pcdball="2" x pcr.></pcr>
The reason for selection of 3.3 
If rl  5,0 (mainly when the diameter DBALL is small), the load capacity would be too small, causing anxiety about the durability.  Also caused is the anxiety that the surface<br><br>
pressure on the surface of contact between the torque transmitting balls and the guide grooves would increase (because the contact oval area decreases<br>
with decreasing diameter DBALL), forming a main cause of the chipping of the edges of the guide grooves.<br>
The range 3.3 S   rl S 5.0 provides greater degrees of strength of the outer joint member, of load capacity and durability of the joint than in the comparative article (6-bal1 constant velocity joint.  This is proved to some extent by tests.<br>
As shown in Table 1 (which shows the estimation of the results Of comparative tests), when rl = 3.2, sufficient strength for the outer and inner joint members and cage was not obtained, an undesirable result.  When rl = 3.3, or 3.4, a rather good result was obtained in respect of strength.  Particularly, when rl I   3.5, sufficient strength for the outer and inner joint members and cage was obtained, a desirable result.  In addition, for the range rl &gt; 3.9, though no test has been conducted, it is expected that as good a result as the above will be obtained.  If rl &gt; 5.0, however, it is considered that problems will arise in respect of durability and the outer and inner joints, as described above; thus, it is desirable that rl S 5.0.<br>
From the above, it is desirable that rl be in the range 3.3 
Further, In addition to the above arrangement, it is desirable that the ratio r2 (= DOUTER / PCD SERH ) of the<br><br>
outer diameter (DOUTER) of the outer joint member to the pitch circle diameter (PCDSBRR) of the tooth profile formed in the inner surface of said inner joint member 2 be within the range 2.5 i   r2 S   3.5.<br>
The reason for selection of 2.5 S r2 Â£   3.5 is as follows:  The pitch circle diameter (PCDs ERR) cannot be widely changed because of the relation to the strength of the mating shaft.  Therefore, the value of r2 depends of the outer diameter (DOUTBR) of the outer joint member.  If r2  3.5 (occurring mainly when the outer diameter POUTER is large), a problem would sometimes arise from a dimensional aspect and the object of making the joint compact could not be attained.  The range 2.5 Â£ r2  3.2).<br>
Thus, r2 should be in the range 2.5 
 <br>
The ball tracks which are enlarged in wedge form in one sense of the axial direction are obtained by offsetting the the centers of the guide grooves of the inner and outer Joint members, respectively, with respect to the spherical centers of the outer and inner surfaces thereof axially by an equal distance (F) in opposite directions.  It is desirable that the ratio Rl (= F / PCR) of the offset (F) to PCR described above be set within the range 0.069 
The reason for selection of 0.069 
If, however, the offset (F) is too large:<br>
(i) torque is reduced in the high operating angle zone, incurring the decrease of allowable load torque;<br>
(ii) in the pockets of the cage, the amount of radial movement of the torque transmitting balls increases, so that to prevent the torque transmitting balls from falling off, it is necessary to increase the wall thickness (radial dimension) of the cage; and<br>
(iii) in the pockets of the cage, the amount of circumferential movement of the torque transmitting balls increases, so that to secure the proper movement of the<br><br>
torque transmitting balls from falling off, it is necessary to increase the circumferential dimension of the cage. Therefore, the posts of the cage become thinner, raising a problem in respect of strength.<br>
On the other hand, if the offset (F) is too small:<br>
(iv) during application of an operating angle, the peak values of the track load (PI) on the load side, and the track load, on the non-load side (P2: during 1 revolution, a phase appears in which the non-load side track is loaded) increase, (PI and P2 indicate peak values at a predetermined phase angle), incurring decreased durabi1i ty; and<br>
(v) the maximum operating angle' decreases.<br>
Thus, too large and too small amounts of offset (F) are both undesirable, and there should be an optimum range in which said problems of <i are balanced with said problems of however the optimum range offset varies size joint and hence must be determined in relation to basic joint. this accounts for use ratio rl f pcr if> 0.121, said problems of (i), (ii), (iii) come up and so does said problems of (iv) and (v) if Rl 
 <br>
than the ordinary value of Rl (which is generally 0.14) in the comparative article (6-ball constant velocity joint). It may be said that in respect of the improvement of allowable torque and the cage strength, the present article is given consideration the more for the less Rl as compared with the comparative article.  The success of setting the Rl within said range is due to the facts that the present article is provided with 8 torque transmitting balls, which is more advantageous in respect of track load than the comparative article (this is verified by theoretical analysis) and that the temperature rise is relatively low, as compared with the comparative article (this is verified by experiments, see Figs. 11 and 12).  In the comparative article (6-ball constant velocity joint, if Rl is set within said range, the track load would become too high, leading to the decrease of durability.<br>
In addition to the above arrangement, the spherical centers of the outer and inner surfaces of the cage may be offset with respect to the joint center plane including the centers of the torque transmitting balls, axially by the same distance (f) in opposite directions.  In this case, it is recommendable that the ratio R2 (= f / PCR) of the offset (f) to PCR be within the range 0 
The reason for selection of 0 
 <br>
durability, and allows the increase of the wall thickness of the inlet of the cage incorporating the inner joint member, thus providing the merit of increasing the s trength.<br>
However, if the offset (f) is too large,<br>
(i) the amount of circumferential movement of the torque transmitting balls in the pockets of the cage increases, so that in order to secure the proper movement of the torque transmitting balls, the necessity arise of increasing the circumferential dimension of the cage. Therefore, the posts of the cage become thinner, causing a problem in respect of strength; and<br>
(ii) the wall thickness of the portion of the cage opposite to the inlet becomes thinner, causing a problem in respect of strength.<br>
From the above, it is seen that too large offset (f) is not desirable and that there is an optimum range in which the significance of providing offset (f) can be balanced with the problems of (i) and (ii).  However, since the optimum range of offset (f) varies with the size of the joint, it should be found in relation to the basic size which indicates the joint size.  This accounts for the sue of the ratio R2 (= f / PCR).  If Rl &gt; 0.052, said problems of (i) and (ii) come up.  From the viewpoint of the securing of the cage strength and durability, the optimum range of offset (f) is 0 
 <br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Embodiments of the invention will now be described with<br>
erence to the drawings.<br>
As shown in Figs. 1A and IB, a constant velocity joint<br>
this embodiment comprises an outer joint member 1 having<br>
curved guide grooves lb axially formed in the spherical<br>
.,ner surface la thereof, an inner joint member 2 having 8<br>
jirved guide grooves 2b axial ly formed in the spherical<br>
Miter   surface 2a thereof and serrations (or splines) 2c inf formed on the inner surface for connection to a shaft<br>
portion 5, 8 torque transmitting balls 3 disposed in ball<br>
itracks defined between the guide grooves lb and 2b of the<br>
outer and inner joint members 1 and 2, and a cage 4 for<br>
retaining the torque transmitting balls 3.<br>
In this embodiment, the centers 01 and 02 of the guide<br><br>
grooves lb and 2b of the outer and inner joint members 1 and 2, respectively, are offset with respect to the spherical centers of the inner and outer surfaces la and 2a axially by an equal distance F in opposite directions (the center 01 is offset toward the open side of the joint, and the center 02 toward the innermost side of the joint).  As a result, the ball track defined between e guide groove lb and the guide groove 2b corresponding eto is wedge-wise enlarged toward the open side of the nt.<br>
^The spherical center of the outer surface 4a of the 4 and the spherical center of the inner surface la of &gt;uter joint member 1 which serves as a guide surface the outer surface 4a of the cage 4 are located in the \     . center plane 0 including the centers of the torque t^i^   smitting balls 3.  Further, the spherical center of the thenL r surface 4b of the cage 4 and the spherical center of ifi'l yaihor surface 2a of the inner joint member 2 which serves as a guide surface for the inner surface 4b of the cage 4 are located in the joint center plane 0.  Therefore, in this arrangement, the amount (F) of offset of the outer joint member 1 is equal to the axial distance between the center 01 of the guide grooves lb and the joint center plane 0, while the amount (F) of offset of the inner joint member 2 is equal to the axial distance between the center 02 of the guide grooves 2b and the joint center plane 0; thus, the two are equal.  The center 01 of the guide<br><br>
grooves lb of the outer joint member 1 and the center 02 of the guide grooves 2b of the inner joint member 2 are axially shifted with respect to the joint center plane 0 through the same distance (F) in opposite directions (the center 01 of the guide grooves lb are shifted toward the open side of the joint and the center 02 toward the innermost side of the joint).  The length of a line segment connecting the center 01 of the guide grooves lb of the outer joint member 1 and the centers 03 of the torque transmitting balls 3, and the length of a line segment connecting the center 02 of the guide grooves 2b of the inner joint member 2 and the centers 03 of the torque transmitting balls 3 are each equal to PCR; thus, the two are equal.<br>
When the outer and inner joint members 1 and 2 make an angular displacement by an angle 9,    the torque transmitting balls 3 guided by the cage 4   are maintained in a bisector plane (9   /   2) bisecting the angle 9   at any operating angle 9,   so that the uniformity of velocity for the joint is secured.<br>
In this embodiment, in addition to the above arrangement, the main dimensions of the joint are set at the following values.<br>
CD The ratio rl (= PCDBACL / DBALL) of the pitch circle diameter PCDBAX.L (PCDBALL = 2 X PCR) of the torque transmitting balls 3 to their diameter DBALL is within the range 3.3 
 <br>
rl 
Joints of arrangements CD and (2) were compared with comparative articles (6-ball constant velocity joints such as one shown in Fig. 23) of the same nominal size as that of said joints, and the results are shown in Table 2.<br>
The constant velocity joint in this embodiment has 8 torque transmitting balls 3 and the ratio of the total load on the joint to the load supported by one torque transmitting ball is small (as compared with the 6-ball constant velocity joint), thus making it possible to reduce the diameter DBALL of the torque transmitting balls 3 as compared with the comparative article of the same nominal size (6-ball constant velocity joint) and to make the respective thicknesses of the outer and inner joint members 1 and 2 substantially equal to those of the comparative article (6-ball constant velocity joint).<br>
Further, as compared with the comparative article of the same nominal size (6-ball constant velocity joint), the present joint can be made compact and at the same time the<br><br>
ratio r2 (= DOUTBR / PCDSEKR) can be reduced (2.5 
It is recommendable to set the amount of offset of the guide grooves lb and 2b as follows.  As described above, (3&gt; it is desirable that the ratio Rl (= F / PCR) be set within the range 0.069 
Figs. 2A through 2D show the outer joint member.  A region in the open side of the inner surface la of the outer joint member 1 is formed with a cylindrical cut lal for incorporating the cage 4 into the inner surface la.  In incorporation of the cage 4, with the axes positioned to intersect at right angles with each other, as shown in Fig. 2A, the pockets 4c of the cage 4 (which is an assembly having the inner joint member 2 incorporated into the inner surface 4b of the cage 4) are brought into the cylindrical cut lal.  In this manner, the cage 4 is inserted until the spherical center of the outer surface 4a coincides with the spherical center of the inner surface la of the outer joint<br><br>
member 1.  From this state, the cage. 4 is turned through 90 degrees until the axis of the cage 4 coincides with the axis of the outer joint member 1.  Thereby, the cage 4 (together with the inner joint member 2) is completely incorporated into the inner surface la of the inner outer joint member 1.<br>
Further, as shown enlarged in Figs. 2C and 2D, a region associated with the guide grooves lb of the outer joint member 1 is formed with a chamfer lbl.  The chamfer lbl has a function which, when the guide grooves lb are heat-treated (in the region W in Fig. 2D), prevents the hardening-through (i.e., prevents the open end surface of the outer joint member 1 from being hardened) and at the same time the chamfer can be utilized as a guide when the torque transmitting balls 3 are incorporated into the pockets 4c.<br>
Figs. 3A and 3B show the inner joint member 2.  The diameter of the outer surface 2a of the inner joint member 2 is A, and the maximum distance across the outer surface 2a in a longitudinal section parallel with the plane S including the bottoms of two diametrically opposite guide grooves 2b is C.<br>
Figs. 4A and 4B show the cage 4.  The cage 4 is provided with 8 circumferential1y equispaced window-like pockets 4c which hold 8 torque transmitting balls 3.  Of the 8 pockets 4c, four are long pockets 4cl having a large circumferential length and the remaining four are short<br><br>
pockets 4c2 having a small. circumferential length, said long and short pockets 4cl and 4c2 alternating with each other.  In this arrangement, the angular spacing of the four short pockets 4c2 is 90 degrees.  In addition, the arrangement may be such that of the 8 pockets 4c, six may be long pockets 4cl and the remaining two may be short pockets 4c2. In this case, the spacing between the two short pockets 4c2 is 180 degrees.  The circumferential length of the short pockets 4c2 is set such that when this constant velocity joint transmits torque at the greatest angle (the greatest operating angle which is functionally allowable as a joint, that is the "maximum operating angle" or the basis is founded on the greatest operating angle which is operatively allowable within the range of the "maximum operating angle"), the torque transmitting balls 3 do not interfere with the circumferential wall surface of the short pockets 4c2.  Further, the circumferential length of the long pockets 4cl is set such that during the incorporation of the torque transmitting balls 3 which is effected by relatively tilting the outer and inner joint members 1 and 2 to cause one short pocket 4c2 to face outward through the opening in the outer joint member 1, previously incorporated torque transmitting balls 3 do not interfere with the circumferential wall surfaces of the long pockets 4cl.  Further, as shown in Figs. 5, 6A and 6B, the diameter (B) of the inlet 4d of the cage 4 for incorporation of the inner joint member 2 is set with<br><br>
respect to the outer diameter (A) of the inner joint member 2 shown in Fig. 3A and to the maximum spacing (C) such that the relation C

4 shown in Fig. 6B, until the axis of the inner joint member 2 and the axis of the cage 4 coincide with each other.  Thereby, the inner joint member 2 is completely incorporated into the inner surface 4b of the cage 4.  In addition, as shown in Figs. 7A and 7B, also in the case of a cage 4 having no step 4e, the parts can be assembled in the same manner as the above.  In this case, with the axis of the inner joint member 2 positioned to intersect at right angles with the axis of the cage 4, incorporation can be continued until the spherical center 0* of the outer-surface 2a of the inner joint member 2 and the spherical center 0" of the inner surface 4b of the cage 4 coincide with each other.  Thereafter, the inner joint member 2 is turned through 90 degrees with respect to the cage 4 until their axes coincide, the advantage being that the operation involved is easy.<br>
Generally, in this type of constant velocity joint, in order to incorporate the inner joint member into the inner surface of the cage, the circumferential length of one of the pockets of the cage or two diametrically opposite pockets is made greater than the axial length of the inner joint member.  And the incorporation is effected such that with the axes of the inner joint member and cage positioned to intersect at right angles with each other, while inserting an outer surface portion of the inner joint member (a portion between circumferential1y adjoining guide grooves) into said pockets of increased circumferential<br><br>
length, the operator inserts the inner joint member into the inner surface of the cage, and turning the inner joint member through 90 degrees with respect to the cage. However, according to the construction and method of incorporation of such cage, the necessity of making the circumferential length of at least one pocket of the cage greater than the axial length of the inner joint member leads to the reduction of the area of the inner and outer surfaces of the cage and the reduction of the circumferential thickness of the post portion between pockets.  This is not preferable for the durability and strength of the cage.  According to the construction and method of incorporation of the cage in the embodiment described above, since there is no need to provide a pocket which has a greater circumferential length than the axial length of the inner joint member, the necessary areas of the inner and outer surfaces of the cage and the circumferential thickness of the post between pockets can be secured to increase the durability and strength of the cage.  Particularly, in the arrangement having 8 torque transmitting balls 3 as in the constant velocity joint of the present invention, the number of pockets 4c of the cage 4 larger than that in the comparative article (6-ball constant velocity joint); therefore, the securing of the durability and strength of the cage is important.<br>
The provision of two types of pockets 4c of the cage 4, I.e., long pockets 4cl and short pockets 4c2 is intended to<br><br>
secure the durability and strength of the cage and to make allowances for incorporation of the torque transmitting balls 3 into the pockets 4c of the cage 4.  In this type of constant velocity joints, incorporation of the torque transmitting balls 3 is effected by incorporating the assembly of cage 4 and inner joint member 2 into the inner surface la of the outer joint member 1 (Fig. 2A) and then, as shown in Fig. 8A, angularly displacing the inner joint member 2 (and the cage 4) with respect to the outer joint member 1.<br>
Now, in this type of constant velocity joints, when the outer and inner joint members transmit torque between each other while taking an operating angle 9, the torque transmitting balls move circumferentially and radially within the pockets of the cage as the phase in the direction of rotation changes.  And the amount of movement of the torque transmitting balls increases in proportion to the operating angle Q,   the latter being greatest when the torque transmitting balls are incorporated (the operating angle 0 at this time is referred to as the "ball incorporation angle a",   the "ball incorporation angle a"   is greater than the "maximum operating angle" which is the greatest operating angle which can be taken by the joint while performing the function as the joint).  Therefore, the amount of movement, particularly the amount of circumferential movement, of the torque transmitting balls is the greatest when the joint takes the ball incorporation<br><br>
angle a; thus, it is necessary to take into account the amount of circumferential movement of the torque transmitting balls when setting the circumferential length of the pockets of the cage.<br>
In Fig. 8B, the torque transmitting balls 3 are shown at 31, 32, â¢â¢â¢, 38 in the various phases in the direction of rotation.  The torque transmitting balls 31, 33, 35, 37 are stored in the short pockets 4c2 and the balls 32, 34, 36, 38 are stored in the long pockets 4cl.  The respective displaced positions of the torque transmitting balls 3 in the pockets 4c in different phases when the joint takes the incorporation angle a  are as shown in Fig. 9A.  In addition, Fig. 9A shows how the torque transmitting balls move in the arrangement in which the spherical centers of the outer surface 4a and inner surface 4b are not offset (the arrangement in which the spherical centers are located in the joint center plane 0), as in the case of the cage 4 in this embodiment, and Fig. 9B show how the torque transmitting balls move in the arrangement in which the inner and outer surfaces of the cage are axially offset an equal amount with respect to the joint center plane 0.<br>
The torque transmitting balls are incorporated, first, in the four long pockets 4cl and then in the short pockets 4c2.  For example, as shown in Fig. 8A, when the torque transmitting ball 31 is to be incorporated into the short pocket 4c2, the amount of circumferential movement of the<br><br>
torque transmitting ball is large in the phases of 32, 34, 36, 38 and small in the phases of 33, 35, 37 (Figs. 9A and 9B).  As described above, the circumferential length of the long pockets 4cl (positioned in the phases of 32, 34, 36, 38 in Fig. 8B) is set such that when a torque transmitting ball 3 is incorporated into one short pocket 4c2 (positioned in the phase of 31 in Fig. 8b), the previously incorporated torque transmitting ball does not interfere with the circumferential wall surfaces of the long pockets 4cl.  Further, in the phase positioned in the short pockets 4c2 (33, 35, 37 in Fig. 8B), the amount of circumferential movement of the torque transmitting balls 3 is small. Therefore, the torque transmitting ball 31 can be incorporated into the short pocket 4c2.  Likewise, when the torque transmitting ball 33, for example, is to be incorporated, the long pockets 4cl are positioned in the phases of 32, 34, 36, 38, and in the phases of 31, 35, 37, the amount of circumferential movement of the torque transmitting balls 3 is small.  Therefore, the torque transmitting ball 33 can be incorporated into the short pocket 4c2.  In this manner, torque transmitting balls 3 can be incorporated into all short pockets 4c2.  (Since torque transmitting balls have previously been incorporated into the long pockets 4cl, it follows that the torque transmitting balls 3 can be incorporated into all pockets 4c.)  In addition, when the balls 3 are being incorporated into the pockets 4c, the chamfer lbl of the outer joint<br><br>
member 1 serves to guide the balls 3 (see Fig. 8A).<br>
Generally, in this type of constant velocity joints, the circumferential length of the pockets of the cage is set on the basis of the maximum amount of circumferential movement of the torque transmitting ball in the pocket during the ball incorporation (as described above, the circumferential length of at least one pocket is made greater than the axial length of the inner joint member), and this leads to the reduction of the area of the inner and outer surfaces of the cage and the reduction of the circumferential thickness of the post between pockets and being not preferable from the viewpoint of the durability and strength of the cage.  In this respect, in the constant velocity joint of this embodiment, the circumferential length of the long pockets 4cl of the cage 4 is set on the aforesaid basis, and circumferential length of the short pockets 4c2 is set on the basis of the maximum amount of circumferential movement of the torque transmitting ball 3 in the pocket during the transmission of torque with the constant velocity joint taking the maximum angle (this angle is smaller than the "ball incorporation angle a").  Such arrangement makes it possible to secure the areas of the inner and outer surface of the cage, the circumferential thickness of the post between pockets, and the durability and strength of the<br>
cage.<br>
Further, in the arrangement in which the spherical<br><br>
centers of the outer and inner surfaces 4a and 4b are not offset as in the cage 4 of this embodiment, since the movements of the torque transmitting balls 3 in the pockets, as shown in Fig. 9A, are the same for the inner and outer surfaces of the cage, the two circumferential wall surfaces 4cll of the pockets 4c may be made in the form of parallel flat surfaces (Fig. 10A), or concavely curved surfaces corresponding to the surface curvature of the torque transmitting balls.<br>
When the outer joint member 1, inner joint member 2, cage 4, and torque transmitting balls have been assembled in the manner described above, the constant velocity joint of this embodiment shown in Figs. 1A and 1R is completed. The serrations (or splines ) 2c of the inner joint member 2have the shaft 5 connected thereto.  In addition, in this embodiment, the shaft 5 is made of boron steel to reduce the size of the shaft 5 (the diameter of the portion which interferes with the open end of the outer joint member is reduced, the diameter of the serrated portion being the same as that of the comparative article).  The intention for reduction of the diameter of the shaft 5 is to make allowances for the increasing operating angle.  In a trial model, a maximum operating angle of greater than 45Â° required for a drive shaft joint for automobiles.<br>
Figs. 11A through 11C show the results of comparative tests of the embodiment article and the comparative article (6-ball constant velocity joint) for the relation between<br><br>
rpm and temperature rise (Â°C).  In the figures, X (dotted line with white circles O) refers to the embodiment article and Y (solid line with black circles O) refers to the comparative article, and the temperature rise (Â°C) was measured 30 minutes after the start of operation.  And 6   is the operating angle of the joint and T is the input rotation torque.<br>
As is clear from the test results shown in the figures, the temperature rise in the embodiment article (X) is lower than that in the comparative article (Y), the difference therebetween increasing with increasing rpm.  Reduction of temperature leads to improved durability.  Further, it is thought that such reduction of temperature rise can be attained irrespective of the operating angle (0) and input rotat ion torque (T).<br>
Fig. 12 shows the results of tests of the embodiment article and the comparative article (6-ball constant velocity joint) (both being of the same nominal size) for the time-dependent change of temperature rise.  In the figure, X (dotted line with white circles O) refers to the embodiment article and Y (solid line with Mack circles O) refers to the comparative article, and 6   is the operating angle of the joint and T is the input rotation torque.<br>
As is clear from the test results shown in the figure, the temperature rise in the embodiment article (X) is relatively lower than that in the comparative article (Y), the difference therebetween not changing so much even if<br><br>
the operating time prolongs.<br>
Fig. 13 show the results of comparative tests of the embodiment article and the comparative article (6-ball constant velocity joint) (both being of the same nominal size) for the relation between the operating angle 0 (in degrees) and torque loss factor (%).  In the figures, X (dotted line with white circles O) refers to the embodiment article and Y (solid line with black circles â¢) refers to the comparative article, and the torque loss factor was measured at the input rotation torque = 196 N â¢ m, for 0 = 10 degrees, and at T = 98 N â¢ m for 0 = 30 degrees.<br>
As is clear from the figure, the torque loss factor for the embodiment article (X) is smaller than that of the comparative article (Y), the difference therebetween increasing with increasing operating angle 0.  The reduction of torque loss factor contributes to fuel saving and energy saving and also to reduction of temperature rise and hence to improved durability as well.<br>
Table 3 shows the results of observation, regarding the embodiment article and the comparative article (6-ball constant velocity joint) (both being of the same nominal size), of how the outer joint member, inner joint member, cage and torque transmitting balls were damaged 300 hours after operation.  As for the cage, the depth of wear in the pockets was measured, and the results are shown in Fig. 14. The test conditions were that operating angle 0=6<br><br>
degrees, input rotation torque T = 1078 N â¢ m, rpm = 200, and total number of revolutions = 3.60 x 10e.  In addition, the tests were conducted using two test articles respectively for the embodiment article and for the comparative article (embodiment articles being indicated by Nos. 1 and 2 and the comparative articles by the Nos. 3 and 4), and the depth of wear shown in Fig. 14 is the mean value for the two test articles.<br>
As is clear from the results shown in Table 3, there was no damage found in any part of both the embodiment articles and the comparative articles.  Further, as is clear from the results shown in Fig. 11, the depth of wear in the pockets of the cage in the embodiment article (X) was less than that in the comparative article (Y).<br>
As has been described so far, the constant velocity joint of this embodiment is compact in shape and yet its load capacity and durability are at least as high as in the comparative article (6-ball constant velocity joint).<br>
Figs. 15A and 15B show a constant velocity joint according to another embodiment of the invention.  The centers 01 and 02 of the guide grooves lb and 2b of the outer and inner joint members 1 and 2, respectively, are offset with respect to the spherical centers 04 and 05 of the inner and outer surfaces la and 2a, respectively, axially by an equal distance F in opposite directions.<br>
Further, in this embodiment, the spherical center of the outer surface 4a* of the cage 4' (which is the same as<br><br>
the spherical center 04 of the inner surface la of the outer joint member 1) and the spherical center of the inner surface 4b' of the cage 4' (which is the same as the spherical center 05 of the outer surface 2a of the inner joint member 2) are offset axially by an equal distance (f) in opposite directions from the center 0 of the joint.  The offset (F) in the outer joint member 1 is the axial distance between the center 01 of the guide grooves lb and the spherical center 04 of the inner surface la and offset (F) in the inner joint member 2 is the axial distance between the center 02 of the guide grooves 2b and the spherical center 05 of the outer surface 2a, and the two are equal.  The length of the line segment connecting the center 01 of the guide groove lb of the outer joint member 1 and the center of the torque transmitting ball 3, and the length of the line segment connecting the center 02 of the guide groove 2b of the inner joint member 2 and the center 03 of the torque transmitting ball 3 are each equal to PCR; thus, the two are equal.<br>
It is recommendable that the offset (f) in the outer surface 4a' and inner surface 4b* of the cage 4' be set as fol lows.<br>
As described above, 
 <br>
set at 0.035.  As for the arrangements (I) , Q,J ,   (&amp;&gt; in the above embodiment, they are the same (however, regarding the arrangement  ,   Rl is set at 0.1003), and a description thereof is omitted.  In addition, the direction of the offset (f) in the cage 4' may be reversed.  That is, the point 04 in Fig. 15A may be the same as the spherical center of the inner surface 4b' and the point 05 may be the same as the spherical center of the outer surface 4a'.<br>
In the cage 4' of this embodiment also, as in the case of the cage 4 in the embodiment described above, the diameter (B&gt; of the inlet 4d' for incorporating the inner joint member 2 is set with respect to the outer diameter (A) of the inner joint member and the maximum spacing (C) such that C S   B 
 <br>
insertion of the inner joint member 2.  At this time, the spherical center 0' of the outer surface 2a of the inner joint member 2 and the spherical center 0" of the inner surface 4b' of the cage 4* are somewhat shifted from each other.  Thereafter, the inner join member 2 is turned through 90 degrees by utilizing the lateral portion T of the step 4e' of the cage 4' showing in Fig. 6B, until the axis of the inner joint member 2 and the axis of the cage 4' coincide with each other.  Thereby, the inner joint member 2 is completely incorporated into the inner surface 4b* of the cage 4'.  In addition, as shown in Figs. 18A and 18B, also in the case of a cage 4' having no step 4e', the parts can be assembled in the same manner as the above.<br>
Further, the cage 4' in this embodiment has 8 pockets for storing 8 torque transmitting balls, said 8 pockets consisting of two types of pockets, long and short, having their circumferential lengths determined on the same basis as in the preceding embodiment.  The respective numbers of short and long pockets, their disposition and their wall shape are the same as in the preceding embodiment. Further, incorporation of the torque transmitting balls 3 into the pockets is effected in the manner shown in Figs. 8A and 8B as in the preceding embodiment.  With the arrangement of this embodiment, however, since the spherical centers 04 and 05 of the outer and inner surfaces 4a' and 4b* of the cage 4' are offset to the positions shown in Fig. 15A, the movements of the torque transmitting<br><br>
balls 3 in the pockets during the ball incorporation are at their greatest on the outer surface side, as shown in Fig. 9B.  In such case, it is recommendab1e that as shown in Figs. 19A and 19B, the two circumferential wall surfaces 4cll\ of the pocket 4c' be in the form of inclined surfaces sloping enlarged toward the outer surface of the cage 4*. Fig. 19A  shows an ,arrangement in which the two wall surfaces 4cll' are flat surfaces, and Fig. 19B shows an arrangement in which the two wall surfaces are curved surfaces corresponding to the curvature of the surface of the torque transmitting balls 3.  As compared with the case where the two circumferential wall surfaces 4cll' of the pocket are parallel surfaces (see Fig. 10), this arrangement is advantageous from the viewpoint of securing the strength and durability of the cage in that the area of the inner surface 4b' of the cage 4' (the area of the post associated with the inner surface side) increases.<br>
In an embodiment shown in Figs. 20A and 20B, a predetermined regions Ul and U2 of the guide grooves lb and 2b of the outer and inner joint members 1 and 2 are straight.  The region of the guide groove lb other than the region Ul is curved with the center at point 01 and the region of the guide groove 2b other than the region U2 is curved with the center at point 02.  The rest of the arrangement is the same as in the embodiment shown in Figs. 15A and 15B, and a description thereof is omitted.<br>
In this connection, it is to be noted that the constant<br><br>
velocity joints described in the above embodiments can be widely used as a power transmission component in automobiles and various industrial machines and instruments and particularly they are useful for use in the power transmitting device of automobiles, for example, as a joint for connecting the drive shaft or propel 1er shaft of an automobile.<br>
For connecting the drive shaft or propeller shaft of an automobile, usually, the fixed type joint and the plunging type joint are used in pair.  For example, the power transmission device of an automobile has to be designed to accommodate angular and axial displacements caused by the change of relative positional relation between the engine and the ground-engaging wheels.  Thus, as shown in Fig. 21, a drive shaft 20 interposed between the engine and the wheel is connected at one end to a differential 22 through a plunging type constant velocity joint 21 and at the other end to the wheel 24 through a fixed type constant velocity joint 23.<br>
If the constant velocity joint described in the above embodiments is used as the fixed type constant velocity joint 23 for connecting the drive shaft 20, this use enables the joint to be reduced in size while securing the strength, load capacity and durability which are at least as high as in the comparative article (6-ball fixed type constant velocity joint); thus, the use is is very advantageous from the viewpoint of vehicle weight reduction<br><br>
and hence low fuel cost.<br>
In addition, in this type of constant velocity joint, the positional relation among the centers of the guide grooves of the outer and inner joint members, the spherical center of the inner surface of the outer joint member (the spherical center of the outer surface of the cage), and the spherical center of the outer surface of the inner joint member (the spherical center of the inner surface of the cage) has 8 variations (a) - (h), and the present invention can be applied to any of these variations.  In this connection, it is to be noted that the arrangement shown in Figs. 1A and IB corresponds to Fig. 22 (b), and the arrangements shown in Figs. 15A, 15B and in Figs. 20A, 20B both correspond to Fig. 22 (a).  Further, it is in the arrangements shown in Figs. 22 (a), (d), (e), (f) and (g) that the movements of the torque transmitting balls are at their greatest on the outer surface side of the cage.<br>
Further, the arrangements CD, (I&gt; , (B) , Â© described in the above embodiment can be used singly or in combination, as (CD), (CD + (I) ), , (CD + Â© +  ),   (CD + @ +.), , ((D + .  (Claim 2), (CD +  (Claim 3), (Â® &gt; (Claim 4), (CD + (3&gt; ) (Claim 4), (CD + Â© + Â®&gt; (Claim 4), (â¬&gt; ) (Claim 6), (CD + Â© ) (Claim 6), (CD +  + Â©.) (Claim 6), ((3) + Â®&gt; (Claim 7), (<d> + Â©&gt; (Claim 7), and (CD + (2&gt; + (3) + Â© ) (Claim 7) .<br><br>
The present invention is applicable not only to a constant velocity joint arranged such that the inner joint member and the shaft are interconnected by a tooth profile (serrations or splines) but also to a constant velocity joint arranged such that the inner joint member and the shaft are integrated.  For example, it is possible to employ an arrangement in which after the torque transmitting balls have been incorporated into the outer joint member, the shaft is integrally joined (by welding, such as laser beam welding, pressing or the like) to the end surface of the inner joint member.<br><br><br>
