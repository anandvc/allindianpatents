COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
SCALE AND/OR CORROSION INHIBITING COMPOSITION"<br>
ASHLAND INC., of P O Box 2219, Columbus, Ohio 43216, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br>
GRANTED<br><br><br><br>
18-1-2005<br><br>
This invention relates to a scale and/or corrosion inhibiting compositions for aqueous systems comprising (a) polyaspartic acid, and (b) a water soluble phosphonared oligomer. The compositions are effective scale inhibitors and corrosion inhibitors, but are also advantageous from an environmental standpoint because they are non-toxic, contain no heavy metals, and have little phosphorus. They also have significant calcium/hardness tolerance and are chlorine/bromine stable.        BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Water used in industrial cooling or mining, systems comes from rivers, lakes, ponds or from underground reservoirs. Such water contains dissolved inorganic salts. When this water circulates through the heat exchangers and cooling towers in a cooling system, a portion of the water is lost due to the evaporation. This increases the concentration of inorganic salts in the system.   If the solubility of these salts in water is exceeded, precipitation will take place.<br>
As the salts precipitate on the internal surface of a cooling system, they form scale or deposits. The scale inhibits effective heat transfer, restricts the flow of the water, and promotes the development of underdeposit corrosion. Consequently, it is necessary to remove the scale by cleaning. Such cleaning is expensive because equipment must be shutdown, labor costs are incurred, and production is delayed. In view of these problems, preventing scale formation is preferred to scale removal.<br>
Scale formation can be inhibited by adding a sequestering or chelating compound to the water treatment system. The amount of a cheating/sequestering compound required is a stoichiometric amount based upon the amount of calcium and magnesium cations in the aqueous system cleaned. This method of the scale inhibition is expensive and not customarily used.<br>
More than 50 years ago it was discovered that certain compounds performed as highly efficient scale inhibitors. Such compounds are used in significantly lower than stoichiometric amounts and are known as "threshold inhibitors".    Examples of<br><br>
threshold inhibitors are phosphonates and water soluble acrylic/maleic/sulfonic polymers or copolymers. Corrosion inhibitors, such as phosphorates, inorganic phosphates, azoles, zinc, and moiybdate, are often used with scale inhibitors.<br>
In addiiion to effective performance, water treatment chemicals must be environmentally acceptable. Environmental regulations prohibit the use of such corrosion inhibitors as chromates and restrictions are now prevalent for the use of all heavy metals. The trend is also toward water treatment chemicals that are non¬toxic, have little or no phosphorus, have high calcium/hardness tolerance, are chlorine/bromine stable, and at the same time have high scale and corrosion efficacy.       Because of these requirements, the cost of water has increased, causing higher reuse/higher cooling cycles which results in cooling waters with high hardness and alkalinity contents.<br>
U.S. patent 5,523,023 relates to compositions comprising polyaspartic acid<br><br>
    and phosphonobutane tricarboxylic acid which arc used for alkaline cleaners. U.S.<br>
     Patent 5,386,038 discloses a water soluble mixture of phosphonated oligomers<br>
having the general formula:<br>
H[CHRCHR]4-PO3M2<br>
wherein at least one R group in each unit is a COOM, CH2OH, sulphono, or      phosphono group and the other R group which may be the same as, or different from, the first R group, is hydrogen or a COOM, hydroxyl, phosphono sulphono, sulphato, C1.7 alkyl, C1.7 alkenyl group or a carboxylate, phosphono, sulphono, sulphato, and/or hydroxy substituted C1.7 alkyl or C1.7 alkenyl group, and each M is a cation such that the phosphonated oligomer is water soluble and n is 1 to 6. These compositions inhibit scale formation and'or the corrosion of metal exposed to aqueous systems.<br>
SUMMARY' OF THE INVENTION<br>

EXAMPLE I<br>
(CaCO3 Scale Threshold Inhibition)<br>
 	Scale inhibition for several scale inhibiting blends containing PCM and PAA<br>
were evaluated with the standard calcium carbonate shaker test. Several controls<br>
were also evaluated.<br>
The procedure involved addine the test scale scale inhihitor composition (amount<br>
specified in Tables I and II) to a solution comprising 90.0 ml of DI water, 5.0 ml of<br>
      the calcium stock solution (14.7 g of CaCl22H1O/literJ'.and 5.0 ml of the alkalinity<br>
stock solution ((1.59 g of Na2CO, + 14.S g of NaHCO,1)/liter) to a 125 ml shaker<br>
flask. The resulting initial test water "parameters were: calcium as CaCOj = 500<br>
ppm, total alkalinity as CaCOj = 500 ppm and pH = 8.5). The flasks were then<br>
covered and put on a shaker at 50°C for 16-18 hours. After the shaker time ended,<br>
     the entire test solution volume was filtrated through Whatman # 5 filter paper. The filtrate was then titrated with 0.01 M EDTA solution to determine the amount of calcium remaining in the test solution. The results are set forth in the Tables I and II, where each % inhibition is an average of 5 repetitions and where the % calcium inhibition was calculated as follows:<br><br>
% Threshold inhibition (% TI) =<br>
[(ppm A - ppm B)   - (500 - ppm B)]    x 100 where: <br>
500     =	initial calcium concentration of 500 ppm as CaCO3, ppm;<br><br><br>
ppm A =	calcium concentration as ppm of CaCOj in the filtrate,<br>
after the testing; and<br>
ppm B =	calcium concentration as ppm of CaCO, in the blank,<br>
after the testing.<br><br><br>
TABLE I % TI FOR PCM/PAA BLENDS<br><br>
The results in Table I show the % TI for PCM/PAA blends. The synergism is clearly indicated for PCM/PAA blends having from 4:1 to 1:9 solids ratio, especially from 1:4 to 1:9 ppm solids ratios.<br>
Table II shows the selected results from the Table I plus additional test results. The test results are arranged to determine whether the PCM/PAA blends exhibit synergism.<br>
TABLEn SYNERGISTIC EFFECT OF BLEIVDS<br><br>
The data in Table II show that the blends of PCM and PAA achieved significantly higher % TI values (achieved) than those which have been theoretically predicted. The difference between the achieved values and predicted values ranged from 8.1% to 38.5%.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
(Spinner Bath Corrosion Test Method) The compositions were also tested on mild steel (CIO 10) test coupons as corrosion inhibitors. The "Spinner 3arh Corrosion Test" was used to evaluate compositions. The procedure involved adding the test corrosion inhibitor composition (amount specified in Table III) to a solution in a test jar. comprising 7.8 liters of DI water, 100.0 ml of the hardness stock solution (70.6 g of CaCl2.2H20 plus 42.0 g of MgCll2.6H1O per liter), and 100.0 ml of the alkalinity stock solution (8.5 g Na,C03 plus 20.2 g of NaHCO, plus 35.5 g of Na2SO4 per liter). The pH of the water was adjusted to 8.5. The mild steel coupons were suspended into the water in the test jar on the spindle which in rum was attached to the drive train. The heat was turned on and the temperature of the water was maintained ar 50°C. The drivetrain was turned on at its standard speed. After 4 full days the system was turned off, coupons removed, cleaned, weighted and corrosion rate as MPY was calculated. The results are set forth in the Table III as ah average of 2 repetitions. The results of this corrosion test are shown in Table III which follows.<br>
TABLE UI (RESULTS OF SPIIVNER BATH CORROSION TEST)<br>
PCM, ppm solids       PAA, ppm solids	MPY<br>
25.0	0.0	20.1<br>
20,0	5.0	98<br>
15.0	10.0	6.5<br>
10.0	15.0	6.1<br>
5.0	20.0	10.8<br>
0.0	25.0	NA'<br>
PAA is known to be very weak and insufficient corrosion inhibitor when used alone. The results of this test confirm this.   The results of this test also show<br><br>
PCM is a weak and insufficient corrosion inhibitor. However, blends of PCM and PAA are shown to have much lower corrosion rates, indicating corrosion inhibition synergy between PCM and PAA.<br>
'The corrosion inhibition rate for the PAA alone is not shown in Table II because a heavy scale was deposited on coupons and therefore comparison with the rest of testir.g(coupor.s free of scale) would not be valid.<br><br>
