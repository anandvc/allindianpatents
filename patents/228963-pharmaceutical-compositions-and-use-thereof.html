Pharmaceutical compositions and use thereof<br>
The invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions of terbinafine, in particular solid dosage forms for oral administration, and their use, in particular in the intermittent treatment of fungal infections, especially onychomycosis.<br>
Terbinafine is known from e.g. EP-A-24587. It belongs to the class of allylamine anti-mycotics. It is commercially available under the trademark LamisilR. Terbinafine is effective upon both topical and oral administration, in a wide range of fungal infections. Terbinafine is particularly useful against dermatophytes, contagious fimgi that invade dead tissues of the skin or its appendages such as stratum corneum, nail, and hair.<br>
Terbinafine may be in free base form or in e.g. pharmaceutically acceptable salt form, e.g. the hydrochloride, lactate, ascorbate or malate, e.g. L.(+)-hydrogen malate form. It preferably is in the hydrochloride acid addition salt form. An acid addition salt form may be prepared from the free base form in conventional manner and vice-versa.<br>
Nail fungi make their home in the nail bed, shielded by the hard outer nail. Thus once the infection is established under the nail, the nail itself provides the fungus with a protective environment that allows it to grow. The effects of these fungi on the nails may be unsightly, seriously complicate foot-care, have a deleterious impact on patients1 overall quality of life and well-being and impair the patients' ability to work. If left untreated, the fungi can deform toenails permanently and lead to pain on walking. Additionally the fungi can lead to fissures in the skin, encouraging bacterial infection. Serious complications as a result of these infections may occur in people suffering from diabetes such as diabetic foot syndrome, including primary disease-related complications, e.g. gangrene that, ultimately, can be life-threatening or require amputations. Other high-risk patient sub-groups include patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and patients with other types of immunosuppression, e.g. transplant recipients and patients on long-term corticosteroid therapy.<br>
There is an increased prevalence of onychomycosis in the elderly (up to 30 % by age sixty). Microsporum, Trichophyton such as Trichophyton rubrum or Trichophyton mentagrophytes, and Epidermophyton such as Epidermophvton floccosum are those<br><br>
microorganisms commonly involved. These infections are conveniently discussed according to the sites of the body involved. Diagnosis is confirmed by demonstrating the pathogenic fungus in scrapings of the lesions, either by microscopic examination or by culture. Across medical disciplines, onychomycosis is well recognized as being arduous both to diagnose and to manage, particularly in the aged.<br>
Terbinafine is particularly useful to treat toenail and fingernail onychomycosis due to dermatophytes (e.g. tinea unguium). Indeed terbinafine has opened up treatment for tinea unguium caused by Trichophyton. For example The Merck Manual [1987] states that treatment of toe-nails should be discouraged with the previously used standard griseofiilvin, because 1 to 2 years treatment is required, recurrence is usual and complete cure unlikely.<br>
For the treatment of onychomycosis and other uses, terbinafine is normally administered as an immediate release tablet form containing 125 mg or 250 mg terbinafine (base equivalent) once daily. Such a tablet sold under the trademark LamisilR releases terbinafine to the extent of at least 80 % over a 30-minute period as measured by standard in vitro dissolution studies, e.g. at pH 3 using the paddle method. This is an example of an immediate release form. Terbinafine treatment over 12 weeks is required (hereinafter referred to as the "original treatment period'5). The progress of its clinical effectiveness may be seen with growth of the healthy nail, pushing out and replacing the diseased unsightly nail-containing debris and dead fungus. About 10 months is needed for a totally new toe-nail to form.<br>
Although terbinafine is generally regarded as safe like any prescription drug, adverse events associated with its use have been reported. As described in the Physicians' Desk Reference, there have been a number of adverse events recorded, e.g. headaches, gastrointestinal symptoms (including diarrhea, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, nausea and flatulence), liver test abnormalities, e.g. enzyme abnormalities, dermatological symptoms such as pruritis, urticaria and rashes, and taste disturbances, e.g. loss of taste. These adverse events are in general mild and transient. Further adverse events include symptomatic idiosyncratic hepatobiliary dysfunction (e.g. cholestatic hepatitis), severe skin reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Yet further adverse events may include visual disturbances such as changes in the ocular lens and retina, as well as allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, fatigue, vomiting, arthralgia, myalgia and hair loss.<br><br>
Terbinafine is a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 and may cause clinically significant interactions when co-administered with substrates of this isoform such as nortriptyline, desipramine, perphenazine, metoprolol, encainide and propafenone. Hereinafter any and all these events are referred to as "Adverse Events".<br>
Various pharmacokinetic and biopharmaceutical properties of terbinafine are known. Thus terbinafine is well absorbed. Peak drug plasma concentrations (Cmax) of about 1 fig/ml appear within 2 hours after administration of a single 250 mg terbinafine dose. The area under the curve over 24 hours (hereinafter AUC) is about 4.56 /ig.hour/ml. A moderate increase in AUC is apparent when terbinafine is administered with a meal. In patients with renal impairment (e.g. creatinine clearance up to 50 ml /min) or hepatic cirrhosis the clearance of terbinafine is reduced by approximately 50 %. In the steady state, e.g. when the troughs and peaks are constant after dosing extending over several days, in comparison to the single dose, the peak terbinafine blood concentration (Cmax) is 25 % higher and the AUC increases by a factor of 2.5. This is consistent with an effective half-life for terbinafine of about 36 hours.<br>
Pharmacokinetic and absorption properties have been disclosed in e.g. J. Faergemann et aL, Acta Derm. Venereol. (Stockh.) 77 [1997] 74-76 and earlier articles. Little has been disclosed on steady-state pharmacokinetics and pharmacokinetics on cessation of steady-state treatment. Although some low aborption was found to occur in the lower gastrointestinal tract, the main site of absorption of terbinafine is not precisely known and as indicated above there is no clinically proven correlation of effect with pharmacokinetic profile.<br>
Further, despite the very major contribution to antimycotic therapy which terbinafine has brought, the reported occurrence of undesirable Adverse Events has been an impediment to its wider oral use or application. The particular difficulties encountered in relation to oral dosing with terbinafine have inevitably led to restrictions in the use of terbinafine therapy for the treatment of relatively less severe or endangering disease conditions, e.g. tinea pedis.<br>
While numerous pharmaceutical compositions for topical and oral administration have been proposed, there still exists a need for commercially acceptable terbinafine formulations for oral administration with good patient convenience and acceptance, especially for children and the elderly. One particular difficulty in the formulation of terbinafine in oral pharmaceutical compositions is its unpleasant, e.g. bitter taste, and/or low physical integrity in free base form. Further, some patients may suffer from taste disturbance or taste loss.<br><br>
It has now been found that, surprisingly, terbinafine has a beneficial pharmacodynamic profile even in situations of high dosage load. It may therefore be administered without untoward effect on e.g. the liver in higher daily dosage used intermittently and for a shorter duration of time than previously contemplated for the treatment of fungal infections such as onychomycosis or fungal sinusitis, yielding the unexpected result of equal or improved therapeutic outcomes from less total drug exposure, thus resulting in an overall dose of less drug than with previously known, e.g. continuous treatments, e.g. of about 30 % less. Thus the present invention enables reduction of terbinafine treatment times and overall dosing over the full treatment period required to achieve effective therapy, thereby reducing the exposure time to terbinafine and improving the global safety profile.<br>
In addition it permits closer standardization as well as optimization of on-going daily dosage requirements for individual subjects receiving terbinafine therapy as well as for groups of patients undergoing equivalent therapy. By closer standardization of individual patient therapeutic regimens, dosaging parameters for particular patient groups, as well as monitoring requirements, may be reduced, thus substantially reducing the cost of therapy. Further, the antifungal activity of terbinafine being not just fungistatic but fungicidal, it maybe used intermittently and administered for a short duration of time while nevertheless being curative, thus largely avoiding the need for prophylactic repeat treatment once mycological cure has been obtained and achieving increased efficacy without corresponding side effects.<br>
The beneficial pharmacodynamic profile of terbinafine appears e.g. from tolerability studies upon high dosage over a short time duration. This is shown in e.g. standard tolerability or pharmacokinetic studies wherein terbinafine in immediate release form, such as a tablet, is administered at dosages higher than usual, namely tolerability studies in beagle dogs effected perorally (p.o.). Pharmacokinetic parameters (toxicokinetics), e.g, tmax, Cmax, Cmax/dose and AUC are measured. The following parameters are also monitored: alanine aminotransferase, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, calcium, chloride, total cholesterol, creatine kinase, creatinine, glucose, inorganic phosphorus, magnesium, potassium, sodium, total bilirubin, total protein, triglycerides and urea, as well as gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT). It was found that after a single peroral administration to male dogs of one standard tablet of terbinafine hydrochloride (125 mg base equivalent) at a<br><br>
mean dose of 12.0 ± 0.3 mg/kg terbinafine (base equivalent), the values determined for tmax, Cmax and Cmax/dose were, respectively: 1 h; 199 ± 85 ng/ml; and 16.6 ± 7.2 (ng/ml)/(mg/kg). Further, it could now be surprisingly determined in extensive computer modeling studies that e.g. in the treatment of onychomycosis, an intermittent dosing of e.g. 350 mg/day terbinafine (base equivalent) administered in 3 cycles, of 14 days on and 14 days off, would result in concentrations in the nail falling between the concentrations achieved with a continuous daily therapy over 12 weeks of, respectively, 125 mg/day, which is known to be less efficacious, and 250 mg/day, which is known to be highly efficacious, in onychomycosis treatment (see Figure). Therefore, it can be concluded that intermittent treatment in the above regimen, or variants thereof, would be expected to produce efficacy in patients.<br><br>
a) Terbinafine plasma concentrations following multiple oral administration is simulated on<br>
the basis of known population pharmacokinetic parameters upon continuous therapy<br>
[J. Nedelman et al., J.Clin.Pharmacol. 36 (1996) 452-456; J. Nedelman et al.,<br>
Biopharm.Drug Dispos. 18 (1997) 127-138; and J. Nedelman et al.,<br>
Eur.J.Drug Metab.Pharmacokinet. 22 (1997) 179-184]. The model incorporates a central, a<br>
rapidly equilibrating (shallow) and a slowly equilibrating (deep) peripheral compartment.<br>
Drug input into the central compartment is described as a zero order absorption process.<br><br>
Elimination is, as is usual, assumed to occur from the central compartment; and<br>
b) a linear relationship is then established between observed nail concentrations<br>
[J. Faergemann et al, Acta Derm.Venereol. 73 (1993) 305-309] and the model-predicted drug<br>
amount in the deep peripheral compartment. Hence the drug amount in the deep compartment<br>
is a suitable predictor for terbinafine nail concentrations.<br>
Accordingly the invention provides a novel method of treatment of fungal infection with terbinafine by administration of high doses over a short period of time, preferably in a cyclical manner, thereby reducing total overall drug intake and further, it has now also become possible to devise corresponding oral galenical formulations for delivering high drug loads in a short time span which would not usually be readily contemplated, such as appropriate coated and/or multiparticulate formulation systems.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention therefore provides a novel terbinafine dosing regimen method which meets or substantially reduces difficulties in terbinafine therapy hitherto encountered in the art. In particular it allows the use of pharmaceutical compositions which deliver terbinafine in sufficiently high concentrations to permit convenient oral once-a-day administration, while at the same time achieving improved safety and tolerability in terms of fewer Adverse Events. Specifically, in one aspect of this embodiment the present invention provides a method of administering terbinafine to a subject in need of terbinafine treatment which comprises administering to the subject terbinafine in an intermittent cycle wherein the terbinafine is administered for more than one-third of the cycle, hereinafter briefly named "the method of the invention".<br>
For example, the cyclically-administered terbinafine in a cycle maybe administered daily or less frequently than daily, preferably daily, e.g. once a day. Preferably terbinafine is administered for a period of from more than one-third to two-thirds, preferably for about one-half of the cycle. A cycle may be e.g. from about 10 to about 50 days. Preferably a cycle is 28 days or a calendar month. Preferably terbinafine is administered daily for 14 consecutive days in a 28 days or monthly cycle, namely, for a 14-day period extending over roughly half a cycle. Preferably there are 3 or 4, especially 3 cycles. Oral administration is preferred.<br><br>
Preferably the treatment period is for 3 or 4, especially 3 cycles in onychomycosis. This period represents the shortest treatment duration to date for treating this chronic infection. It is surprising that terbinafine in the method of the invention is at least as effective as with the original treatment but exhibits fewer Adverse Events than expected.<br>
The above cyclical treatment may conveniently be used in combination with topical treatment with e.g. a cream containing terbinafine, e.g. 1 % by weight.<br>
While pulse therapies with terbinafine have been envisaged in the past, they had either led to negative results (A. Tosti et al., J.Am.Acad.Dermat. 34 [1996] 595-600), and/or each proposed pulse was for a shorter duration with lower initial load and with more repeats (DE 100'17'996-Al) than with the present invention.<br>
The above novel cyclical terbinafine dosing regimen method may be effected using conventional galenical forms, e.g. uncoated immediate release or sustained-release tablets (see e.g. Examples A and B hereafter).<br>
However, in another embodiment, the invention further provides novel galenical formulations of terbinafine which may advantageously be administered in e.g. the method of the invention and allow particularly favourable systemic delivery of high once daily drug dosages in coated and/or multiparticulate form, resulting in low pharmacokinetic variability and few Adverse Events.<br>
This follows from the further unexpected finding, in a study in dogs, of even lower pharmacokinetic variability when the standard 125 mg immediate release tablet is compared with an equivalent dose of terbinafine in a multiparticulate system (the coated minitablets of Example 4); it was found that the already low variability of the immediate release tablet is even further reduced in the multiparticulate system: while, as described above, at a mean dose of 12.0 ± 0.3 mg/kg terbinafine (base equivalent), after a single peroral administration of the standard tablet to male beagle dogs the values determined for mean , Cmax, Cmax/dose and AUC were, respectively: 1 h; 199 ±85 ng/ml; 16.6 ± 7.2 (ng/ml)/(mg/kg); and 526 ±171 ng.hour/ml, with dogs receiving the coated minitablets at the same dosage of terbinafine, the values obtained were, respectively: 0.75 h; 246 ± 48 ng/ml; 20.5 ± 4.3 (ng/ml)/(mg/kg); and 644 ± 161 ng.hour/ml.<br><br>
Thus a similar mean AUC [644 ±161 v. 526 ±171 ng.hour/ml] and a similar mean Cmax [246 ±48 v. 199 ± 85 ng/ml] were found for both galenical forms, but a much lower inter-subject variability of Cmax [± 48 v. ± 85 ng/ml standard deviation in Cmax] for the multiparticulate form v. the standard tablet. Furthermore, median tmax values were found to be 0.75 h and 1 h, respectively, for the multiparticulate and the standard form, with single values ranging from only 0.5 to 1 h for the multiparticulate form, but from 0.5 to 2 h for the standard form.<br>
The pharmacokinetic parameters of both formulations were obtained using the same dog individuals and a crossover study design, hence possible period and inter-animal variability effects can be excluded. Plasma containing EDTA as anticoagulant was collected up to 48 hours post-dose, and bioanalysis was performed using HPLC with UV detection (measurement at 224 nm) after liquid-liquid extraction of the sample. The lower limit of quantification of the bioanalytical method was 1.00 ng/ml plasma. The dogs were fasted before administration. The washout period was one week between two administrations in the same dog. Feeding was performed 6 hours or more after dosing.<br>
In one aspect of this other embodiment, the invention thus provides a novel terbinafine solid dosage form for oral administration which is suitable for minimizing effects associated with e.g. a high dosage load and which is coated and/or multiparticulate, e.g which comprises coated tablets providing less adverse events/side effects, and/or multiple, easily dispersed particles providing e.g. a reproducible and mainly food-independent transit through the gastrointestinal tract and a high surface area for reproducible dissolution of the drug substance, such as optionally coated minitablets or pellets in capsules, hereinafter briefly named "the compositions of the invention".<br>
Intermittent dosing allows administration of less total dose, but it involves administration of high daily doses: thus, the potential for transient adverse effects is enhanced, namely,<br>
-	at the systemic level, the higher plasma concentrations achieved (AUC, Cmax) are leading to<br>
higher risk of adverse effects associated with pharmacokinetic variability or<br>
of e.g. centrally-induced taste disturbance; and<br>
-	at the local level, e.g. in increased risk of sensation of the bitter taste of terbinafine and/or of<br>
locally-induced taste disturbance.<br><br>
The first concern above has now been found to be favourably addressed with multiparticulate systems, the second concern with appropriate coating, whereby these two aspects may advantageously be combined.<br>
Taste disturbance or taste loss after terbinafine intake is a relatively rare and reversible Adverse Event that may, however, in single cases continue over an extended period, e.g. for longer than 12 weeks after cessation of treatment. Drug-induced taste disturbances can be divided into taste perversion (dysgeusia) and loss of acuity of taste (hypogeusia) or complete loss of taste (ageusia). In addition the sense of smell may be affected (hyposmia or anosmia). These changes, apart from their unpleasantness, can impair appetite, causing weight loss. Many drugs have been reported to cause taste disturbances or taste loss, including the antifungal agents griseofulvin and amphotericin B. ATi receptors may be involved in their pathogenesis. Terbinafine can also cause taste disturbances in a small number of patients: thus, in one large post-marketing surveillance study conducted in Austria, Germany, the Netherlands and United Kingdom in which patients were given 250 mg LamisilR (terbinafine) daily for a mean duration of 13.2 weeks, 186 instances of taste disturbances occurred altogether during the period of oral administration, representing a total incidence of 0.72 %, of which 0.37 % (97 patients) concerned primary dysgeusia (taste perversion) and 0.32 % (84 patients) ageusia (complete taste loss). All the patients recovered fully on discontinuing treatment.<br>
In 7 further studies involving 959 LamisilR- and placebo-treated patients in 4 placebo-controlled and 3 dose-duration studies, the frequencies of reports of taste disturbance were 3.2 % in patients given LamisilR in the placebo-controlled studies, 1.2 % in those given LamisilR in dose-duration studies, and 0.6 % in placebo patients. Three of the patients had ageusia, the others had a variety of dysgeusia: salty, metallic, bland and bitter tastes. All patients made a complete recovery, with an average recovery time of 10.2 weeks. While annoying, none of the reported taste disturbances was considered to be harmful.<br>
In rare instances the disturbances last longer than 12 weeks. The longest duration reported after discontinuation of drug was 2.5 years.<br><br>
Therefore, while taste disturbances after terbinafine intake are rare and innocuous, they can be unpleasant and thus there is still a so far unmet need for novel means allowing treatment of fungal infection with terbinafine which eliminate or mitigate taste-related Adverse Events. The present invention also addresses this issue and provides a novel approach thereto.<br>
The compositions of the invention are adapted for release of the active substance terbinafine in the stomach; for example, in 0.04 M citrate buffer pH 3.0 at 37°C, terbinafine is released from the composition and dissolves within 30 minutes to the extent of at least 50 %, e.g. at least 70 % preferably at least 80 %.<br>
The constituent particles of the multiparticulate system have a size ranging from about 0.5 mm to about 4 mm in diameter. They are not granules (typically of a particle size of up to about 0.5 mm) and include e.g. tablets, pellets or minitablets. Tablets, pellets or minitablets may be filled into capsules, e.g. hard gelatin capsules, or into sachets. Typically, one administration comprises a plurality of pellets or minitablets to achieve the desired overall dose of terbinafine per day.<br>
The particles preferably are minitablets or pellets, i.e. they are presented formulated in a form that allows easy administration of a high load of active substance. The term "minitablets" denotes small tablets with an overall weight in their uncoated form of from about 3 to about 10 mg, e.g. from about 4 to about 7 mg, e.g. about 6 mg. The minitablets may have any shape convenient to the skilled person for tablets, e.g. spherical, e.g. with a diameter of from about 0.5 to about 4 mm, e.g. 1 to 4 mm or 2 to 4 mm; or cylindrical, e.g. having a convex upper face and convex lower face and e.g. with a cylindrical diameter and height which are, independently of each other, of from about 0.5 to about 4 mm, e.g. 1 to 3 mm; or they may be biconvex round minitablets, e.g. whose height and diameter are approximately equal and are from about 0.5 to about 4 mm, e.g. 1.5 to 4 mm, preferably 1.8 to 2.3 mm.<br>
The minitablets maybe uncoated, or coated with one or more layers of coating.<br>
In one variant the minitablets are uncoated. In a further variant they are coated with only hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC), e.g. HPMC 603 available as e.g. PharmacoatR 603 (see H.P. Fiedler, loc.cit. hereafter, p. 1172). In a further variant the coating(s) include(s) a taste-masking material, e.g. a polyacrylate, preferably an EudragitR such as EudragitR-E or EudragitR-RD100 or -RS/RL (see Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, loc.cit. hereafter,<br><br>
p. 362), especially EudragitR-E. In a further variant they are coated with a 3rd coating, e.g. with HPMC or polyethyleneglycols (PEG) to minimize further any interaction between minitablet and e.g. capsule. In a further variant the coating is devoid of plasticizer such as dibutyl sebacate, or the plasticizer is a fatty acid such as stearic acid, e.g. stearic acid NF (National Formulary, USP). In a further variant they are unencapsulated. In a further variant in the encapsulating material gelatin is replaced with alternative hard capsule materials, e.g. HPMC or starch.<br>
Similar considerations apply mutatis mutandis for pellets as set out hereabove for minitablets; pellets preferably have a diameter of from about 0.5 to about 2 mm.<br>
The compositions of the invention are formulated in a manner allowing optimal delivery, e.g. they are uncoated or, preferably, coated as appropriate. Accordingly, the invention also provides a terbinafine solid dosage form for oral administration which is coated, e.g. drag£es, or coated tablets, pellets or minitablets. It further provides a terbinafine solid dosage form for oral administration which is multiparticulate, e.g. optionally coated minitablets or pellets, e.g. in capsules. It further provides a novel terbinafine solid coated and/or multiparticulate dosage form for oral administration which has taste-masking properties and/or prevents taste disturbance or taste loss and associated adverse effects such as impaired appetite and weight loss.<br>
Suitable coating materials for the compositions of the invention include: i)    pharmaceutically acceptable cellulose derivatives such as ethyl cellulose (EC), hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC), hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate (HPMCP) or cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP); ii)   polyacrylates, especially polymethacrylates, preferably:<br>
a)	a copolymer formed from monomers selected from methacrylic acid, methacrylic acid esters, acrylic acid and acrylic acid esters;<br>
b)	a copolymer formed from monomers selected from butyl methacrylate, (2-dimethylaminoethyl)methacrylate and methyl methacrylate; or<br>
c)	a copolymer formed from monomers selected from ethyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate and trimethylammonioethyl methacrylate chloride;<br>
e.g. those available from Rohm GmbH under the trademark Eudragit ;<br><br>
iii) polyvinyl acetate phthalate (PVAP);<br>
iv) polyvinyl alcohols;<br>
v)   polyvinylpyrrolidones (PVP);<br>
vi) sugar such as saccharose or glucose, or sugar alcohols such as xylit or sorbit;<br>
vii) shellac; and<br>
viii) mixtures thereof.<br>
Preferred cellulose derivatives i) are e.g. modified celluloses, e.g. hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, e.g. hydroxypropyl cellulose having a hydroxypropyl content of about 5 to 16 % by weight and of viscosity for 2 % w/w aqueous solutions of from about 2.0 to about 20 cps (= mPa.s), preferably from about 2.0 to about 6.0, e.g. 3.0 cps, e.g. hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) (e.g. USP type 2910, 3 cps), available as e.g. PharmacoatR 603.<br>
Especially preferred polyacrylic polymers ii) are:<br>
1)	the 1:1 copolymers formed from monomers selected from methacrylic acid and methacrylic<br>
acid lower alkyl esters, such as the 1:1 copolymers formed from methacrylic acid and<br>
methyl methacrylate available under the trademark EudragitR L, e.g. EudragitR LI00,<br>
and the 1:1 copolymer of methacrylic acid and acrylic acid ethyl ester available under the trademark EudragitR L100-55;<br>
2)	the 1:2:1 copolymer formed from butyl methacrylate, (2-dimethylaminoethyl)-methacrylate and methyl methacrylate available under the trademark EudragitR E; and<br>

The polyacrylates of group 3) above normally contain cationic ester groups. Examples of such cationic groups include dialkylaminoalkyl groups, e.g. dimethylaminoalkyl groups. Especially preferred cationic groups include quaternary ammonium groups, preferably a tri(alkyl)aminoalkyl group. Examples of such groups are trimethylaminoethyl ester groups. The polyacrylate may contain some carboxylic acid groups in free form or salt anions,<br><br>
e.g. chloride anions in order to balance the cationic groups. The ratio of cationic groups to neutral groups is preferably from 1:10 to 1:50, e.g. from 1:10 to 1:30.<br>
The polyacrylates of group ii) above have a mean molecular weight of about 50'000 to about 500*000, e.g. about 150*000.<br>
Preferably, the coating materials comprise HPMC, Eudragits or sugar. It has been found that polyacrylates ii), especially EudragitR E, are particularly suitable for coating solid dosage forms comprising terbinafine in the form of the free base as well as in form of its salts, e.g. terbinafine hydrochloride, e.g. since a coating with EudragitR E does not easily dissolve at the neutral pH of the mouth, but only at pH values below 5, and thereby prevents the dissolution of the bitter tasting terbinafine until transfer to the stomach.<br>
Coating materials as hereinabove defined may be used in admixture with further excipients conventional in coating formulations, for example talcum, magnesium stearate or silicon dioxide, for example synthetic amorphous silicic acid of the SyloidR type (Grace), for example SyloidR 244 FP, or colloidal silicon dioxide, e.g. AerosilR, e.g. AerosilR 200, or wetting agents, for example sodium dodecyl sulfate or the aforementioned polyethyleneglycols or polysorbates.<br>

In one embodiment, the solid dosage forms may be coated by one, or preferably by two or more coatings which are applied one after the other. In one aspect, the solid dosage forms may be coated by a first (e.g. protective) coating applied directly upon the solid dosage form, e.g. comprising HPMC, and a second (e.g. taste-masking) coating applied upon the first coating, e.g. comprising EudragitR, preferably EudragitR E or EudragitR RD100, or ethyl cellulose.<br>
In another aspect the solid dosage forms may comprise a further coating, e.g. a layer of anti-sticking material applied upon one of the above-mentioned coatings, e.g. comprising a colloidal silicon dioxide product, e.g. Aerosil , which may avoid adhesion of the solid dosage forms to each other or to the walls of the container material, e.g. a capsule.<br>
Typically, overall coating weights for coating materials i) to v) range from about 0.5 to about 10 mg/cm based on the surface area of the uncoated formulation, e.g. from about 1 to about 4 mg/cm , e.g. they are about 1.5 mg/cm .

Typically, overall coating weights for coating materials vi) to vii) range from about 10 to about 200 % of core weight, preferably from about 50 to about 100 % of core weight.<br>
Terbinafine base equivalent may be present in an amount of from about 0.1 to about 95 %, e.g. from about 20 to about 90 %, preferably from about 30 to about 80 %, especially from about 50 to about 60 % by weight based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
The solid dosage forms typically may comprise disintegrants, e.g. such pharmaceutical excipients which facilitate the disintegration of a solid dosage form when placed in an aqueous environment, and may comprise e.g. the following:<br>

The disintegrant may be present in an amount of from about 1 to about 50 %, e.g. from about 5 to about 40 % by weight based on the total weight of the uncoated composition.<br>
In a further aspect the invention provides a composition of the invention wherein the ratio of terbinafine (base equivalent) to disintegrant is from about 1 : 0.01 to about 1 : 20, e.g. from about 1 : 0.05 to about 1 : 5, preferably from about 1 : 0.05 to about 1 : 1 by weight.<br>
The compositions of the invention may also comprise further components which are commonly employed in the preparation of dosage forms, e.g. solid dosage forms. These components include, among others: binders; filler and plasticising agents; lubricants,<br>
e.g. magnesium stearate; and glidants, e.g. silica, e.g. in particular colloidal silicon dioxide<br>

In a further aspect the invention provides a composition of the invention wherein the ratio of terbinafine (base equivalent) to binder is from about 1 : 0.01 to about 1 : 10, e.g. from about 1 : 0.01 to about 1:1, preferably from about 1 : 0.01 to about 1 : 0.1, especially about 1 : 0.04 by weight.<br>
Suitable filler and plasticising agents include excipients known for their favourable properties as filler and plasticising agents, and include: (i)   substantially water-insoluble excipients such as microcrystalline cellulose (which may<br>
also be regarded as a weak disintegrant), e.g. AvicelR, PharmacelR, EmcocellR, VivapurlR,<br>
preferably AvicelR (FMC Corp.), e.g. of the types AvicelR PH101, 102,105, RC 581 or<br>

In a further aspect the invention provides a composition of the invention wherein the ratio of terbinafine (base equivalent) to filler or plasticising agent is from about 1 : 0.01 to about 1 : 100, e.g. from about 1 : 0.01 to about 1 : 20, preferably from about 1 : 0.01 to about 1 : 10, especially from about 1 : 0.1 to about 1 : 5, more especially about 1 : 0.2 by weight.<br>
The compositions of the invention may conveniently further comprise a suitable buffering component, e.g. a salt of an acid that is partially dissociated in aqueous solution, and include those buffering components which - upon disintegration of the composition in an<br><br>
aqueous medium (e.g. the oral cavity) - are capable of maintaining a pH at which terbinafine remains substantially insoluble, e.g. a pH in acidic range, e.g. a pH of greater than 4, preferably of from about 5 to about 6, on treatment with excess water, e.g. 5 to 100 ml. Examples of suitable buffers include carbonate, citrate, acetate, phosphate, phthalate, tartrate salts of the alkali and alkaline earth metal cations, such as sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium. Preferred buffering agents include e.g. calcium carbonate, trisodium citrate and sodium hydrogen carbonate. The buffering agents may be used singly or in any suitable combination for achieving the desired pH and may be of a buffer strength of from about 0.01 to about 1 mole/litre, preferably from about 0.01 to about 0.1 mole/litre.<br>
The molar ratio of terbinafine (base equivalent) to buffering component may be from about 1 : 0.02 to about 1:10, e.g. from about 1 : 0.2 to about 1:10, preferably from about 1 : 0.5 to about 1 : 5, more preferably from about 1 : 0.5 to about 1 : 2.<br>
It will be appreciated that the invention encompasses:<br>

b)	in respect of the binder and filler or plasticizing agent any of those specified above individually or in combination; and<br>
c)	in respect of the buffering component any of the buffers specified above individually or in combination.<br>
The compositions may conveniently also include one or more further additives or ingredients in an amount of e.g. from about 0.01 to about 5 % by weight based on the total weight of the uncoated composition, for example: sweetening agents, e.g. sorbitol, saccharin, aspartame, acesulfame or sugars such as glucose, fructose or saccharose; flavouring agents, e.g. chocolate, cocoa, banana, strawberry or vanilla flavour; and so forth. Additives to sugar or shellac coating commonly used in confectioning may be employed where appropriate.<br>
Determination of workable proportions in any particular instance will generally be within the capability of the man skilled in the art. All indicated proportions and relative weight ranges described above are accordingly to be understood as being indicative of preferred or individually inventive teachings only and not as limiting the invention in its broadest aspect.<br><br>
Especially preferred compositions of the invention are coated minitablets or pellets wherein the coating comprises a (taste-masking) polyacrylate coating, preferably EudragitR E or Eudragit RD100R, especially EudragitR E, whereby the polyacrylate coating and the terbinafine-containing core optionally are separated by a readily-dissolving<br>
(protective) coating of, preferably, a cellulose derivative such as HPMC, and optionally further coated with a layer preventing sticking of the minitablets or pellets to each other or to the capsule shell, e.g. comprising colloidal silica such as AerosilR 200; most especially preferred are the compositions of Examples 5,8,9 and 10, preferably Examples 5 and 8, especially Example 8.<br>
In a subgroup the (taste-masking) polyacrylate coating is separated from the core by a readily-dissolving (protective) coating as decribed above.<br>
In yet another aspect the invention provides a process for preparing a coated composition of the invention as defined above, comprising appropriately coating a corresponding uncoated precursor form of a composition of the invention, using conventional methods, e.g. as described in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Edition, Ed. Alfonso R. Gennaro, Easton, PA : Mack (1990); and in K. Bauer et al., Uberzogene Arzneiformen (1988), Wissensch. VG, Stuttgart; the contents of which are incorporated herein. E.g. a coating system may be used in e.g. a conventional non-perforated pan or in a perforated pan by the Accela Cota method, or the submerged sword coating method or fluid bed coating method may be used.<br>
The compositions of the invention thus obtained have an acceptable taste and thus have particularly good patient convenience and patient acceptance due to their increased ease of administration and ingestion. Furthermore, the compositions of the invention, preferably those that are in coated form, prevent taste disturbance or taste loss, probably by preventing terbinafine interference with taste receptors in the oral cavity, in particular on the tongue.<br>
Thus, the compositions of the invention, which are conveniently in solid form, e.g. in the form of a coated tablet or of coated pellets or minitablets, or dragees (i.e. tablets coated with a coating containing sugar and/or sugar alcohols), preferably in the form of a coated tablet or coated minitablets or pellets, may be administered as such or, if desired, e.g. with coated<br><br>
pellets or minitablets, dispersed (but preferably not substantially dissolved) prior to administration in a small amount of a liquid or semi-liquid, e.g. water, milk, yoghurt or juice, e.g. in a spoon.<br>
In addition the compositions of the invention show surprisingly high physical and chemical stability, e.g. for up to two or more years. The physical and chemical stability may be tested in conventional manner, e.g. the compositions may be tested as such by measurement of dissolution, disintegration time, and/or by hardness test, e.g. after storage at room temperature, i.e. at 25°C&gt; and/or after storage at 40°C. The taste of the compositions may be tested in standard clinical studies.<br>
The particles of the multiparticulate system of the invention, e.g. minitablets or pellets may be packaged in conventional manner, e.g. in a bottle, or worked-up into optionally coloured capsules. Such capsules may be in e.g. two parts, and each part may conveniently be of a different colour.<br>
The compositions of the invention are useful for the known indications of terbinafine, e.g. for the following conditions: onychomycosis caused by dermatophyte fungi, fungal sinusitis, tinea capitis, fungal infections of the skin, for the treatment of tinea corporis, tinea cruris, tinea pedis, and yeast infections of the skin caused by the genus Candida, e.g. Candida albicans, systemic mycosis, mycosis by azole-resistant strains, e.g. in combination with a 14-a-methyldimethylase inhibitor, or infections with Helicobacter pylori.<br>
The compositions are particularly effective in treating onychomycosis.<br>
In a further aspect of this embodiment the invention provides a method of treatment of fungal infection of the human body, e.g. onychomycosis, comprising administering a pharmaceutically effective amount of a composition of the invention to a subject in need of such treatment.<br>
It further provides a method of inhibiting or reducing taste disturbance or taste loss and associated adverse effects after terbinafine intake which comprises administering to a subject prone to taste disturbance or taste loss, a composition of the invention.<br><br>
It further provides the use of a composition of the invention in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of fungal infections of the human body, in particular of onychomycosis.<br>
It further provides the use of a composition of the invention in the manufacture of a medicament for inhibiting or reducing taste disturbance or taste loss and associated adverse effects such as impaired appetite and weight loss after terbinaflne intake.<br>
It further provides the use of a composition of the invention in the manufacture of a medicament for use in the method of the invention as defined above.<br>
The utility of the compositions of the invention may be observed in standard bioavailability tests or standard animal models, for example ascertaining dosages giving blood levels of terbinafine equivalent to blood levels giving a therapeutical effect on administration of known terbinafine oral dosage forms, e.g. a tablet. Typical doses are in the range of from about 1 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg, e.g. from about 1.5 mg/kg to about 5 mg/kg, or e.g. from about 3 to about 4 mg/kg body weight of terbinafine base equivalent per day. The appropriate dosage will, of course, vary depending upon, for example, the host and the nature and severity of the condition being treated. However in general satisfactory results in animals are indicated to be obtained at daily treatments with doses from about 1 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg animal body weight. In humans an indicated daily dosage is in the range of from about 10 mg to about 1000 mg per day, conveniently administered, for example, in divided doses up to four times a day or once daily. Preferred dosages for children weighing less than 20 kg may be about 62.5 mg once daily, for children weighing from 20 to 40 kg about 125 mg once daily, for children weighing more than 40 kg about 250 mg once daily, and for adults from about 250 mg to about 500 mg once daily.<br>
Terbinafine may be administered in immediate release form, e.g. as a tablet or capsule, e.g. a tablet comprising 350 mg base equivalent of active substance, or e.g. one or two capsules with minitablets or pellets comprising 350 mg base equivalent of active substance in total, or in sustained release form. Immediate release forms are preferred.<br><br>
Suitable sustained release forms are described in Pharmazeutische Technologic Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart/New York, 2nd Edition [1991], Ed. H. Sucker, P. Fuchs, P. Spieser, e.g. on p. 370-390. Further systems are described in e.g. Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Ed. Herbert A. Lieberman, Leon Lachman, Joseph B. Schwartz, 2nd edition, Vol. 3, Marcel Dekker; and   -Remington, The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, Ed. Alfonso Gennaro, 19th Edition [1995]. A wide variety of sustained release systems may be used.<br>
Details of excipients useful in compositions for use in the present invention are known, e.g. from the presently commercialized forms of LamisilR, or as described in H.P. Fiedler, "Lexikon der Hilfsstoffe fur Pharmazie, Kosmetik und angrenzende Gebiete", Editio Cantor Verlag Aulendorf, Aulendorf, 4th revised and expanded Edition (1996); or in "Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients", 2nd Edition, Ed. A. Wade and PJ. Weller (1994), Joint publication of American Pharmaceutical Association, Washington, USA and The Pharmaceutical Press, London, England; or may be obtained from brochures from the relevant manufacturers, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
The amount of terbinafine in a composition of the invention will of course vary, e.g. depending on to what extent other components are present. In general, however, the terbinafine will be present in an amount within the range of from 10 % to about 80 % by weight based on the total weight of the composition. Compositions will preferably be compounded in unit dosage form, e.g. by filling into capsule shells, e.g. soft or hard gelatin capsule shells or by tabletting or other moulding process. Thus unit dosage terbinafine composition, suitable for administration once or twice daily (e.g. depending on the particular purpose of therapy, the phase of therapy, etc.) will appropriately comprise half or the total daily dose contemplated. Preferably the compositions of the invention are administered once-a-day.<br>
As indicated above, a preferred treatment method according to the invention (hereinafter referred to as method A) is an intermittent cycle wherein the terbinafine (350 mg base equivalent) is administered daily for about half, i.e. two weeks, of a 28 days or monthly cycle, followed by about 2 weeks, i.e. 14 or 16-17 days of rest (no drug). This cycle is then repeated for a total of three or four, especially three cycles.<br><br>
The pharmacokinetic properties of the compositions of the invention may be determined in standard animal and human pharmacological (bioavailability) trials.<br>
For example one standard pharmacological trial may be carried out in healthy male or female non-smoking volunteers aged between 18 to 45 years having within 20 % of the ideal body weight. Blood samples are taken for 1,2,4, 8,16, 32 and 72 hours post-administration in the method of the invention and tested for terbinafine. Terbinafine blood plasma concentrations may be determined in conventional maimer, e.g. by HPLC or GLC analytical techniques. Safety is judged according to a standard checklist based on Adverse Event symptoms after 1 week.<br>
A further standard pharmacological trial is e.g. a bioavailability/food-effect study in a randomized, open-label, three-period, crossover study to evaluate the relative bioavailability of a composition of the invention, e.g. the capsules of Example 5 or 8, compared with standard terbinafine immediate release tablets and to assess the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of the compositions of the invention after a single dose in 24 healthy adult subjects. The study includes the following three treatments:<br>
-	treatment A: 250 mg single standard immediate release tablet under fasted conditions;<br>
-	treatment B: 350 mg capsule (2 x 175 mg) of Example 5 under fasted conditions; and<br>
-	treatment C: 350 mg capsule (2 x 175 mg) of Example 5 under fed conditions.<br>
For each of the three treatment periods, safety assessments are performed and blood samples collected at defined timepoints until 96 h post-dosing to determine i.a. terbinafine imax, Cmax and AUG (area under the curve).<br>
Pharmacokinetic drug skin and nail concentration studies may be carried out according to the same principles as set out for the above-mentioned standard pharmacological trials. For example a clinical trial may be effected in Method A.<br>
A therapeutic clinical trial may be effected based on the principles of the standard pharmacological trials mentioned above. For example, a randomized double-blind positive-controlled and placebo-controlled study may be effected with subjects having onychomycosis of the toe-nail confirmed by microscopy and culture. Treatment is carried out preferably with three 28-days or monthly cycles in the method of the invention, using the<br><br>
175 mg capsules of Example 5, and with the original treatment over 12 weeks. Clinical trials may be effected in several hundred patients to ascertain the freedom from Adverse Events. However therapeutic efficacy may be shown in trials with 25 patients aged over 12 years. Safety is evaluated by an Adverse Event report of clinical aspects and vital signs. Efficacy is determined by microscopy, culture procedures and visually looking at signs and symptoms. Efficacy is seen in patients with the fungi described above, especially Trichophyton rubrum. Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Epidermophyton floccosum. Patients include those with predisposing factors such as impaired blood circulation, peripheral neuropathy, diabetes mellitus, damage from repeated minor trauma, and limited immune defects as well as AIDS. Patients have (i) distal lateral subungual onychomycosis starting at the hyponychium spreading proximally to the nail bed and matrix, (ii) proximal subungual onychomycosis, wherein the fungus infects the cuticle and eponychium to reach the matrix where it becomes enclosed into the nail plate substance, (iii) total dystrophic onychomycosis, and (iv) superficial white onychomycosis. If desired serum concentrations of terbinafine may be evaluated in conventional manner. Concentrations of terbinafine in the nail may be evaluated by both photo-acoustic spectroscopy and nail clipping followed by analysis, indicating presence of terbinafine in the nail-bed.<br>
Clinical trials may be effected in particular sub-sets of subjects, e.g. those with impaired renal or hepatic function. Changes in the standard clinical chemistry parameters measured for liver dysfunction are lower than expected for the method of the invention. It is also found that any such dysfunctions are transient and functional. This indicates the excellent tolerability of the compositions of the invention.<br>
The compositions for use in the method of the invention are useful for the same indications as for known immediate release terbinafine tablets, e.g. fungal sinusitis and onychomycosis. The utility of compositions of the invention maybe observed in standard clinical tests or standard animal models.<br>
The compositions in the method of the invention are particularly and surprisingly well tolerated with regard to the Adverse Events mentioned above, provoking fewer Adverse Events than would be expected in the original treatment with the standard 250 mg immediate release LamisilR tablet. From the clinical trials it is seen that the compositions of the invention<br><br>
are just as efficacious particularly in aged patients, e.g. of 70 years and above, in patients with renal impairment (e.g. creatinine clearance &gt; 50 ml/min) or hepatic cirrhosis, and yet tend to provoke surprisingly fewer Adverse Events than expected for the dose given. Moreover the variation in AUC between fasted and fed state is less than expected.<br><br>
The following Examples illustrate the invention. They are not limitative. All temperatures are in degrees Centigrade. The following abbreviations are used:<br><br>
