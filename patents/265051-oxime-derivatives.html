Oxime derivatives and the use the of as latent acids<br>
The invention relates to new oxime derivatives, chemically amplified photoresist compositi¬ons comprising said compounds and to the use of the compounds as latent acids, which can be activated by irradiation with actinic electromagnetic radiation and electron beams.<br>
In US 4540598 surface-coating compositions comprising photosensitive oxime sulfonate compounds, e.g. 4-chloro-a-trifluoroacetophenonoxime benzenesulfonate and customary acid-curable resins are disclosed. In US 4736055 2,2,2-trifluoro-1-phenyl-ethanone oxime-0-(4-hydroxyphenylsulfonate) is described as a component for the preparation of polymers which can be used as resins in positive photoresists. In US 5627011 and US 5759740 the use of a-(4-toluene-sulfonyloxyimino)-4-methoxybenzyl cyanide and a-(4-toluene-sulfonyl-oxyimino)-3-thienylmethyl cyanide as latent acid catalysts in chemically amplified positive and negative photoresists for wavelengths of 340-390 nm, especially those in the radiation region of the mercury i line (365 nm) is described. In GB 2306958 the use of oxime-sulfonates as latent acid donors in positive and negative photoresists for wavelengths between 180 and 600 nm, especially those in the radiation region beyond 390 nm is reported. In US 5714625 non aromatic a-(alkylsulfonyloxyimino)-1-cyclohexenylacetonitril-es and a-(alkylsulfonyloxyimino)-1-cyclopentenylacetonitriles are disclosed. In EP 241423 oxime sulfonate compounds are employed in about 25% concentration as photolatent acid generators in non-chemically amplified positive resists. In Chemical Abstracts No. 97:144503, 78:97752, Synthesis (1995), 553, some fluoroketoxime sulfonate compounds are described as experimental products for synthetic studies. In US 6261738 and WO 02/025376 oxime sulfonate compounds are described as latent acid donors in positive and negative photoresists particular suitable for applications in the Deep UV range. In US 4566901 1-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-trichloromethylsuifonyloximino-2,2)2-trifluoroethane, 1-phenyl-1-trichloromethylsulfonyloximin0"2,2,2-trifluoroethane, 1-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-trifluoromethyl-sulfonyloximino-2,2,2-trifluoroethane, and 1 -(4-chlorophenyl)-1 -chloromethylsulfonyloximino-2,2,2-trifluoroethane are described as antidotes for protecting cultivated plants from the phytotoxic action of aggressive herbicides. In J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans I (1989), 1172-1174 some flouroketoxime sulfonate compounds are described as precursors of diaziridines.<br>
In the art exists a need for reactive non-ionic latent acid donors that are thermally and chemi¬cally stable and that, after being activated by light, UV-radiation, X-ray irradiation or electron<br><br>
beams can be used as catalysts for a variety of acid-catalysed reactions, such as polycon-densation reactions, acid-catalysed depolymerisation reactions, acid-catalysed electrophilic substitution reactions or the acid-catalysed removal of protecting groups. A particular need exists for latent acid catalysts with high stability and high sensitivity not only at Deep-UV range but also at longer wavelengths such as i-line (365 nm).<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that specific oxime derivatives, as described below, are stable and highly active against not only Deep-UV light but also Mine. The oxime derivatives in the present invention are especially suitable as catalysts for the aforementioned acid catalyzed reactions in chemically amplified photoresist application. Furthermore, chemically amplified photoresist compositions comprising oxime derivatives of the present invention are thermally stable, even at high bake temperatures during processing and provide high photospeed.<br>

C2-C18alkyl, which is interrupted by one or more O, is interrupted, for example, from one to five times, for example from one to three times or once or twice, by non-successive O. Accordingly, resulting structural units are for example:<br>
-0(CH2)20H, -0(CH2)2OCH3, -0(CH2CH20)2CH2CH3, -CH2-0-CH3, -CH2CHrO-CH2CH3, -[CH2CH20]y-CH3, wherein y = 1-5, -(CH2CH20)5CH2CH3, -CH2-CH(CH3)-0-CH2-CH2CH3 or -CH2-CH(CH3)-0-CH2-CH3.<br>
C3-C3ocycloalkyl is a mono- or polycyclic aliphatic ring, for example a mono*, bi- or tricyclic aliphatic ring, e.g. C3-C20-, C3-Ci8-, C3-C12-, C3-C10cycloalkyl. Examples of monocyclic rings are cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, or cycloheptyl, especially cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl. Examples of polycyclic rings are perhydroanthracyl, perhydrophenyathryl, per-hydronaphthyl, perhydrofluorenyl, perhydrochrysenyl, perhydropicenyl, adamantyl, bicyclo-[1.1.1]pentyl, bicyclo[4.2.2]decyl, bicyclo[2.2.2]octyl, bicyclo[3.3.2]decyl, bicyclo[4.3.2]undec-yl, bicyclo[4.3.3]dodecyl, bicyclo[3.3.3]undecyl, bicyclo[4.3.1]decyl, bicyclo[4.2.1]nonyl, bicyc-lo[3.3.1]nonyl, bicyclo[3.2.1]octyl and the like. Also "spiro"-cycloalkyl compounds are cover¬ed by the definition C3-C30cycloalkyl in the present context, e.g. spiro[5.2]octyl, spiro[5.4]dec-yl, spiro[5.5]undecyl.   More examples of polycyclic cycloalkyl groups, which are subject of<br><br>
the respective definition in the compounds of the present invention are listed in EP 878738, page 11 and 12, wherein to the formulae (1 )-(46) a bond to achieve the "yl" has to be added. The person skilled in the art is aware of this fact. In general, the cycloaliphatic rings may form repeating structural units.<br>
C3-C30cycloalkyl which is interrupted by one or more O, S, NR6, O(CO), NReCO, is a mono-or polycyclic aliphatic ring which is interrupted by one or more O, S, NR6, O(CO), SCO,<br>

C4-C30cycloalkenyl is a mono- or polycyclic and polyunsaturated ring, for example a mono-, bi- or tricyclic polyunsaturated ring, e.g. C4-C20-, C4-C18-, C4-Ci2-, C4-C10cycloalkenyl. Examples of cycloalkenyl are cyclobutenyl, cyclopentenyl, cyclohexenyl, or cycloheptenyl, especially cyclopentenyl and cyclohexenyl.<br>
C2-C6alkylene is linear or branched alkylene. Examples are ethylene, propylene, butylene, pentylene, hexylene.<br>

Oxime derivatives of formulae I, II and III can generally be prepared by methods described in the literature, for example by reacting suitable free oximes (RT = H) of formula T or II" with the desired (for example, sulfonic) acid halides or acid anhydrides of formula V or VI (for example, R^l or R-pO-Ri).<br><br>
Ri, R2) X, A^ and Ary are defined as described above.<br><br>
These reactions usually are carried out in an inert solvent such as for example toluene, methylene chloride, tetrahydrofuran (THF) or dimethylformamide (DMF) in the presence of a base, for example pyridine, a tertiary amine, such as triethylamine, or by reaction of the salt of an oxime with the desired acid chloride. These methods are disclosed, for example, in EP 48615. The sodium salts of oximes can be obtained, for example, by reacting the oxime in question with a sodium alcoholate in dimethylformamide. Such reactions are well known to those skilled in the art, and are generally carried out at temperatures in the range of -15 to +50°C, preferably 0 to 20°C.<br>
The oximes required as starting materials can be obtained by a variety of methods described in standard chemistry textbooks (for instance in J. March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, 4th Edition, Wiley Interscience, 1992), or in specialized monographs, for example, S.R. Sandler &amp; W. Kara, Organic functional group preparations, Vol. 3, Academic Press. One of the most convenient methods is, for example, the reaction of ketones with hydroxyl-amine or its salt in polar solvents like ethanol or aqueous ethanol. In that case, a base such as sodium acetate is added to control the pH of the reaction mixture. It is well known that the rate of the reaction is pH-dependent, and the base can be added at the beginning or continuously during the reaction. Basic solvents such as pyridine can also be used as base and/or solvent or cosolvent. The reaction temperature is generally the refluxing temperature of the mixture, usually about 60-120°C.<br>
Another convenient synthesis of oximes is the nitrosation of "active" methylene groups with nitrous acid or an alkyl nitrite. Both alkaline conditions, as described for example in Organic Syntheses coll. Vol. VI (J. Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1988), pp 199 and 840, and acidic condi¬tions, as described, for example, in Organic Synthesis coll. vol V, pp 32 and 373, coll. vol. Ill, pp 191 and 513, coll. vol.II, pp. 202, 204 and 363, are suitable for the preparation of the ox¬imes used as starting materials for the compounds according to the invention. Nitrous acid is usually generated from sodium nitrite. The alkyl nitrite can for example be methyl nitrite, ethyl nitrite, isopropyl nitrite, butyl nitrite, isoamyl nitrite.<br>
The described syntheses can result in the formation of isomeric forms of the compounds of formula I, II and III. The double bond of the oximino group can exist in both the syn (cis, Z) and the anti (trans, E) form or as mixtures of the two geometrical isomers. In the present invention, both the individual geometrical isomers and any mixtures of two geometrical<br><br>
isomers can be used. The invention accordingly also relates to mixtures of isomeric forms of the compounds of formula I, II and III.<br>
The compounds of formula I, II and III of the individual geometrical isomers (Z and E forms) and any mixtures of two geometrical isomers can be used, however, it has been found that the compounds of formula lf II and III of a specific configuration (tentatively assigned as E-form) are more thermally stable than the compounds of other configuration (tentatively assigned as Z-form). Therefore, preferred use of the compounds of the present invention are of formula formula I, II and III of the single more thermally stable isomer (tentatively assigned as E-form).<br>
The syntheses of the oximes required as starting materials can result in the formation of a mixture of isomeric forms. Surprisingly, it has been found that the mixture of isomeric forms of the oximes required as starting materials is converted to a single isomeric form (tentatively assigned as Z-form) by treatment with acid. Using these oximes of the single isomer (Z-form) as the starting materials, the compounds of formula I, II and III of the thermally more stable single isomer are obtained. Accordingly the present invention also relates to a process for the synthesis of the thermally more stable isomer of the compounds of formula I, II and III by 1) conversion of the corresponding isomeric mixture of oximes to the oximes of the single isomeric form by treatment with an acid, and 2) reaction of the oximes of the single isomeric form with the desired acid halides or acid anhydride.<br>
Subject of the invention therefore is a process for the specific preparation of the thermally stable isomer of the oxime ester compounds of formula I, II and III by<br>
(1)	treating the isomeric mixture of the corresponding free oxime compounds of formula I"<br>
or II", obtained by conventional methods,<br>
  (II"), wherein<br>
R2, Ari, Ar\ and X are as defined in claim 1 with an acid; and<br>
(2)	reacting the thus prepared single isomeric free oxime compound with the corresponding<br>
acid halides or acid anhydrides of formula V or VI<br><br>
RiCI       (V),	R1-O-R1     (VI).<br>
The conversion reactions of the isomeric mixture of oximes to the desired single isomer are usually carried out in an inert solvent such as methylene chloride, ethyl acetate, toluene, tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide or acetic anhydride in the presence of an acid such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, acetic acid, nitric acid, trifluoroacetic acid, or trifluoromethanesulfonic acid. The conversion reactions can also be carried out in acid solvent, e.g., formic acid, acetic acid optionally in the presence of other acid such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, trifluoroacetic acid, or trifluoromethanesulfonic acid. Such reactions are usually carried out at temperature in the range of -15°C to +120°C, preferably 0°C to 80°C, more preferably 5°C to 40°C. The compounds are isolated by methods known to the person skilled in the art, e.g. distillation, recrystallisation, chromatographic methods.<br>
Examples for conventional methods to obtain the oxime compounds of formula r and IT as starting materials are given above.<br>
The compounds of the formulae I, II and III can be used as photosensitive acid donors in a photoresist. Resist systems can be prepared by image-wise irradiation of systems comprising compounds of formulae I, II and III followed by a developing step.<br>
The invention accordingly relates to a chemically amplified photoresist composition compris¬ing<br>
(a)	a compound which cures upon the action of an acid or a compound whose solubility is<br>
increased upon the action of an acid; and<br>
(b)	as photosensitive acid donor, at least one compound of the formula I, II or III.<br>
A chemically amplified photoresist is understood to be a resist composition wherein the radi¬ation sensitive component provides a catalytic amount of acid which subsequently catalyses a chemical reaction of at least one acid-sensitive component of the resist. Resulting is the induction of a solubility difference between the irradiated and non-irradiated areas of the res¬ist. Because of the catalytic nature of this process one acid molecule can trigger reactions at multiple sites as it diffuses through the reactive polymer matrix, from one reaction site to the next, as long as it is not trapped or destroyed by any secondary reaction. Therefore, a small acid concentration is sufficient to induce a high difference in the solubility between ex-<br><br>
posed and unexposed areas in the resist. Thus, only a small concentration of the latent acid compound is necessary. As a result, resists with high contrast and high transparency at the exposure wavelength in optical imaging can be formulated, which in turn produce steep, vertical image profiles at high photosensitivity. However, as a result of this catalytic process, it is required that the latent acid catalysts are chemically and thermally very stable (as long as not irradiated) in order not to generate acid during resist storage or during processing, which -in most cases- requires a post exposure bake step to start or to complete the catalytic reaction which leads to the solubility differential. It is also required to have good solubility of the latent catalysts in the liquid resist formulation and the solid resist film to avoid any particle generation which would interfere with the application of these resists in microelectronic manufacturing processes.<br>
In contrast, positive resist materials which are not based on the chemical amplification mechanism must contain a high concentration of the latent acid, because it is only the acid concentration which is generated from the latent acid under exposure which contributes to the increased solubility of the exposed areas in alkaline developer. Because small acid concentration has only a little effect on the change of the dissolution rate of such resist and the reaction proceeds typically without a post exposure bake here, the requirements regarding chemical and thermal stability of the latent acid are less demanding than for chemically amplified positive resists. These resists require also a much higher exposure dose to generate enough acid for achieving sufficient solubility in the alkaline developer in the exposed areas and also suffer from the relatively low optical transparency (due to the high concentration of latent acid necessary) and thus also lower resolution and sloped images. Resist compositions based on non-chemically amplified technology are therefore inferior in photosensitivity, resolution and image quality compared to chemically amplified resists.<br>
From the above it becomes clear that chemical and thermal stability of a latent catalyst is vital for a chemically amplified resist and that latent acids which can work in a non-chemically amplified resist are not necessarily applicable to chemically amplified resists because of the different acid diffusion requirements, acid strength requirements and thermal and chemical stability requirements.<br><br>
The difference in resist solubility between irradiated and non-irradiated sections that occurs as a result of the acid-catalysed reaction of the resist material during or after irradiation of the resist may be of two types depending upon which further constituents are present in the resist. If the compositions according to the invention comprise components that increase the solubility of the composition in the developer after irradiation, the resist is positive. The invention accordingly relates to a chemically amplified positive photoresist.<br>
If, on the other hand, the components of the formulation reduce the solubility of the composi¬tion after irradiation, the resist is negative. The invention accordingly relates also to a chemically amplified negative photoresist.<br>
A monomeric or polymeric compound which - in the unexposed areas - reduces the disso¬lution rate of an additionally present alkaline soluble binder resin in the resist formulation and which is essentially alkali-insoluble in the unexposed areas so that the resist film remains in the unexposed area after development in alkaline solution, but which is cleaved in the presence of acid, or is capable of being rearranged, in such a manner that its reaction pro¬duct becomes soluble in the alkaline developer is referred to hereinafter as dissolution inhibi¬tor.<br>

Such chemically amplified positive resist systems are described, for example, in E Reich-manis, F. M. Houlihan, O. Nalamasu, T. X. Neenan, Chem. Mater. 1991, 3, 394; or in C. G. Willson, "Introduction to Microlithography, 2nd. Ed.; L S. Thompson, C. G. Willson, M J, Bowden, Eds., Amer. Chem. Soc, Washington DC, 1994, p. 139.<br>
Suitable examples of acid-labile groups which decompose in the presence of an acid to pro¬duce aromatic hydroxy groups, carboxylic groups, keto groups and aldehyde groups and increase the solubility in aqueous alkaline developer solution are, for example, alkoxyalkyl ether groups, tetrahydrofuranyl ether groups, tetrahydropyranyl ether groups, tert.-alkyl ester<br><br>

Hybrid systems can also be applied, wherein, both, high activation energy blocking groups as well as low activation energy blocking groups are present within one polymer.   Alternatively, polymer blends of<br><br>

The content of acid labile monomers in the polymer may vary over a wide range and de¬pends on the amount of the other comonomers and the alkaline solubility of the deprotected polymer. Typically, the content of monomers with acid labile groups in the polymer is bet¬ween 5 and 60 mol%. If the content is too small, too low development rates and residues of the resist in the exposed areas result. If the content of acid labile monomers is too high, re¬sist patterns are poorly defined (eroded) after development and narrow features cannot be resolved anymore and/or the resist looses its adhesion to the substrate during development. Preferably the copolymers which have acid labile groups have a Mwof from about 3000 to about 200'000, more preferably from about 5'000 to about 50'000 with a molecular weight distribution of about 3 or less, more preferably a molecular weight distribution of about 2 or less. Non-phenolic polymers, e.g. a copolymer of an alkyl acrylate such as t-butyl acrylate or t-butyl-methacrylate and a vinyl alicyclic compound, such as a vinyl norbonanyl or vinyl cy-ciohexanol compound, also may be prepared by such free radical polymerization or other known procedures and suitably will have a Mwof from about 8'000 to about 50'000, and a molecular weight distribution of about 3 or less.<br>
Other comonomers may suitably be added in an appropriate amount for the purpose of con¬trolling the glass transition point of the polymer and the like.<br>
In the present invention a mixture of two or more polymers having acid-labile groups may be used. For example, use may be made of a mixture of a polymer having acid-labile groups, which are cleaved very easily, such as acetal groups or tetrahydropyranyloxy- groups and a polymer having acid-cleavable groups, that are less easily cleaved, such as for example terti¬ary alkyl ester groups. Also, acid cleavable groups of different size can be combined by blending two or more polymers having different acid cleavable groups, such as a tert-butyles-ter group and 2-methyl-adamantyl group or an 1-ethoxy-ethoxy group and a tetrahydropyran¬yloxy group. A mixture of a non-crosslinked resin and a crosslinked resin may also be used The amount of these polymers in the present invention is preferably from 30 to 99% by weight, more preferably from 50 to 98% by weight, based on the total amount of all solid components. An alkali-soluble resin or monomeric or oligomeric compound having no acid-labile groups may be further incorporated into the composition in order to control the alkali solubility.<br><br>
Examples of polymer blends with polymers having different acid-labile groups are given n EP 780732, EP 679951 and US 5817444.<br>
Preferably monomeric and oligomeric dissolution inhibitors (a2) are used in the present invention.<br>
The monomeric or oligomeric dissolution inhibitor having the acid-labile group for use in the present invention is a compound which has at least one acid-labile group in the molecular structure, which decomposes in the presence of acid to increase the solubility in aqueous al¬kaline developer solution. Examples are alkoxymethyl ether groups, tetrahydrofuranyl ether groups, tetrahydropyranyl ether groups, alkoxyethyl ether groups, trityl ether groups, silyl eth¬er groups, alkyl carbonate groups, trityl ester groups, silyl ester groups, alkoxymethyl ester groups, vinyl carbamate groups, tertiary alkyl carbamate groups, trityl amino groups, cumyl ester groups, acetal groups, ketal groups, tetrahydropyranyl ester groups, tetrafuranyl ester groups, tertiary alkyl ether groups, tertiary alkyl ester groups, and the like. The molecular weight of the acid-decomposable dissolution inhibitive compound for use in the present in¬vention is 3'000 or lower, preferably from 100 to 3*000, more preferably from 200 to 2'500.<br>

The composition can also contain polymeric dissolution inhibitors, for example, polyacetals as described for example in US 5354643 or poly-N,0-acetals for example those described in US 5498506, either in combination with an alkaline soluble polymer, or in combination with a<br><br>
polymer containing acid labile groups which increase the solubility of the resist film in the de¬veloper after   exposure, or with a combination of both types of polymers.<br>
In the case where the dissolution inhibitor having acid-labile groups is used in the present in¬vention in combination with the sulfonate derivatives of formula I, II or III, the alkali-soluble polymer and/or the polymer having acid-labile groups, the amount of the dissolution inhibitor is from 3 to 55% by weight, preferably from 5 to 45% by weight, most preferably from 10 to 35% by weight, based on the total amount of all solid components of the photosensitive com¬position.<br>
A polymer soluble in an aqueous alkali solution (a3) is preferably used in the present inventi¬on. Examples of these polymers include novolak resins, hydrogenated novolak resins, ace-tone-pyrogallol resins, poly(o-hydroxystyrene), poly(m-hydroxystyrene), poly(p-hydroxystyre-ne), hydrogenated poly(hydroxystyrene)s, halogen-or alkyl-substituted poly(hydroxystyre-ne)s, hydroxystyrene/N-substituted maleimide copolymers, o/p- and m/p-hydroxystyrene co¬polymers, partially o-alkylated poly(hydroxystyrene)s, [e.g., o-methylated, o-(1-methoxy)eth-ylated, o-(1-ethoxy)ethylated, o-2-tetrahydropyranylated, and o-(t-butoxycarbonyl)methylated poly(hydroxystyrene)s having a degree of substitution of from 5 to 30 mol% of the hydroxyi groups], o-acylated poly(hydroxystyrene)s [e.g., o-acetylated and o-(t-butoxy)carbonylated poly(hydroxystyrene)s having a degree of substitution of from 5 to 30mol% of the hydroxyi groups], styrene/maleic anhydride copolymers, styrene/hydroxystyrene copolymers, a-meth-ylstyrene/hydroxystyrene copolymers, carboxylated methacrylic resins, and derivatives there¬of. Further suitable are poly (meth)acrylic acid [e.g. poly(acrylic acid)], (meth)acrylic acid/(meth)acrylate copolymers [e.g. acrylic acid/methyl acrylate copolymers, methacrylic acid/methyl methacrylate copolymers or methacrylic acid/methyl methacrylate/t-butyl methacrylate copolymers], (meth)acrylic acid/alkene copolymers [e.g. acrylic acid/ethylene copolymers], (meth)acrylic acid/(meth)acrylamide copolymers [e.g. acrylic acid/acrylamide copolymers], (meth)acrylic acid/vinyl chloride copolymers [e.g. acrylic acid/ vinyl chloride copolymers], (meth)acrylic acid/vinyl acetate copolymer [e.g. acrylic acid/ vinyl acetate copolymers], maleic acid/vinyl ether copolymers [e.g. maleic acid/methyl vinyl ether copolymers], maleic acid mono ester/methyl vinyl ester copolymers [e.g. maleic acid mono methyl ester/methyl vinyl ether copolymers], maleic acid/(meth)acrylic acid copolymers [e.g. maleic acid/acrylic acid copolymers or maleic acid/methacrylic acid copolymers], maleic acid/(meth)acrylate copolymers [e.g. maleic acid/methyl acrylate copolymers], maleic acid/-<br><br>
vinyl chloride copolymers, maleic acid/vinyl acetate copolymers and maleic acid/alkene copo¬lymers [e.g. maleic acid/ethylene copolymers and maleic acid/1-chloropropene copolymers]. However, the alkali-soluble polymer for use in the present invention should not be construed as being limited to these examples.<br>
Especially preferred alkali-soluble polymers (a3) are novolak resins, poly(o-hydroxystyrene), poly(m-hydroxystyrene), poly(p-hydroxystyrene), copolymers of the respective hydroxystyre-ne monomers, for example with p-vinylcyclohexanol, alkyl-substituted poly(hydroxystyrene)s, partially o- or m-alkylated and o- or m-acylated poly(hydroxystyrene)s, styrene/hydroxystyre-ne copolymer, and a-methylstyrene/hydroxystyrene copolymers. The novolak resins are obtained by addition-condensing one or more given monomers as the main ingredient with one or more aldehydes in the presence of an acid catalyst.<br>
Examples of monomers useful in preparing alkaline soluble resins include hydroxylated aro¬matic compounds such as phenol, cresols, i.e., m-cresol, p-cresol, and o-cresol, xylenols, e.g., 2,5-xylenoI, 3,5-xylenol, 3,4-xylenol, and 2,3-xylenol, alkoxyphenols, e.g., p-methoxy-phenol, m-methoxyphenol, 3,5-dimethoxyphenol, 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol, m-ethoxyphen-ol, p-ethoxyphenol, m-propoxyphenol, p-propoxyphenol, m-butoxyphenol, and p-butoxyphen-ol, dialkylphenols, e.g., 2-methyl-4-isopropylphenol, and other hydroxylated aromatics includ¬ing m-chlorophenol, p-chlorophenol, o-chlorophenol, dihydroxybiphenyl, bisphenol A, phenyl-phenol, resorcinol, and naphthol. These compounds may be used alone or as a mixture of two or more thereof. The main monomers for novolak resins should not be construed as being limited to the above examples.<br>
Examples of the aldehydes for polycondensation with phenolic compounds to obtain novola-ks include formaldehyde, p-formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, benzatdehyde, phenylacetaldehyde, a-phenylpropionaldehyde, p-phenylpropionaldehyde, o-hydroxybenzal-dehyde, m-hydroxybenzaldehyde, p-hydroxybenzaldehyde, o-chlorobenzaldehyde, nvchloro-benzaldehyde, p-chlorobenzaldehyde, o-nitrobenzaldehyde, m-nitrobenzaldehyde, o-methyl-benzaldehyde, m-methylbenzaldehyde, p-methylbenzaldehyde, p-ethylbenzaldehyde, p-n-butylbenzaldehyde, furfural, chloroacetaldehyde, and acetals derived from these, such as chloroacetaldehyde diethyl acetal. Preferred of these is formaldehyde. These aldehydes may be used alone or in combination of two or more thereof. Examples of the acid catalyst include hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, formic acid, acetic acid, and oxalic acid.<br><br>
The weight-average molecular weight of the thus-obtained novolak resin suitably is from 1 '000 to 30'000.   If the weight-average molecular weight thereof is lower than 1 '000, the film reduction at unexposed parts during development is liable to be large.   If the weight-average molecular weight there of exceeds 50*000, the developing rate may be too low. The especial¬ly preferred range of the molecular weight of the novolak resin is from 2'000 to 20'000. The poly(hydroxystyrene)s and derivatives and copolymers thereof shown above as alkali-soluble polymers other than novolak resins each have a weight-average molecular weight of 2'000 or higher, preferably from 4'000   to 200'000, more preferably from 5*000   to 50000. From the standpoint of obtaining a polymer film having improved heat resistance, the weight-average molecular weight thereof is desirably at least 5'000 or higher. Weight-average molecular weight in the context of the present invention is meant to be the one determined by gel permeation chromatography and calibrated for with polystyrene stand¬ard.<br>
In the present invention the alkali-soluble polymers may be used as a mixture of two or more thereof. In the case where a mixture of an alkali-soluble polymer and the polymer having groups which decompose by the action of an acid to enhance solubility in an alkaline devel¬oping solution is used, the addition amount of the alkali-soluble polymer is preferably up to 80% by weight, more preferably up to 60% by weight, most preferably up to 40% by weight, based on the total amount of the photosensitive composition (excluding the solvent). The am¬ount exceeding 80% by weight is undesirable because the resist pattern suffers a consider¬able decrease in thickness, resulting in poor images and low resolution. In the case where an alkali-soluble polymer is used together with a dissolution inhibitor, with¬out the polymer having groups which decompose by the action of an acid, to enhance solubi¬lity in an alkaline developing solution, the amount of the alkali-soluble polymer is preferably from 40% to 90% by weight, more preferably from 50 to 85%by weight, most preferably 60 to 80% by weight. If the amount thereof is smaller than 40% by weight, undesirable results such as reduced sensitivity are caused. On the other hand, if it exceeds 90% by weight, the resist pattern suffers a considerable decrease in film thickness, resulting in poor resolution and image reproduction.<br>
The content of the sulfonate derivatives of formula I, II or III (component (b)) in the positive resist according to the present invention is preferably between 0.01% to 20% by weight, based on the total amount of all solid components in the photoresist.<br><br>
The use of the sulfonate derivatives according to the invention in chemically amplified systems, which operates on the principle of the removal of a protecting group from a polymer, generally produces a positive resist. Positive resists are preferred over negative resists in many applications, especially because of their higher resolution. There is, however, also interest in producing a negative image using the positive resist mechanism, in order to combine the advantages of the high degree of resolution of the positive resist with the properties of the negative resist. This can be achieved by introducing a so-called image-reversal step as described, for example, in EP 361906. For this purpose, the image-wise irradiated resist material is before the developing step treated with, for example, a gaseous base, thereby image-wise neutralizing the acid which has been produced. Then, a second irradiation, over the whole area, and thermal aftertreatment are carried out and the negative image is then developed in the customary manner.<br>
The compounds of the formula I, II and III according to the present invention are in particular suitable as photolatent acids in the ArF resist technology, i.e. a technology using ArF excimer lasers (193 nm) for the imaging step. This technology requests the use of specific polymers/copolymers. Suitable formulations and the preparation of suitable polymer/copoly-mers are for example published in<br>

It is understood, that the compounds of the present invention are in particular suitable for use as photolatent acid in all the polymers/copolymers and compositions described in these cited publications.<br>
Acid-sensitive components that produce a negative resist characteristically are especially compounds which, when catalysed by an acid (e.g. the acid formed during irradiation of the compounds of formulae I, II or III are capable of undergoing a crosslinking reaction with themselves and/or with one or more further components of the composition.   Compounds of<br><br>
this type are, for example, the known acid-curable resins, such as, for example, acrylic, poly¬ester, alkyd, melamine, urea, epoxy and phenolic resins or mixtures thereof. Amino resins, phenolic resins and epoxy resins are very suitable. Acid-curable resins of this type are ge¬nerally known and are described, for example, in "Ullmann's Encyclopadie der technischen Chemie" [Ullmanns Enceclopedia of Technical Chemistry], 4th Edition, Vol. 15 (1978), p. 613 - 628. The crosslinker components should generally be present in a concentration of from 2 to 40, preferably from 5 to 30, percent by weight, based on the total solids content of the negative resist composition.<br>
The invention thus includes, as a special embodiment, chemically amplified negative, alkaii-<br>
developable photoresists, comprising<br>
(a4) an alkali-soluble resin as binder<br>
(a5) a component that when catalysed by an acid undergoes a crosslinking reaction with<br>
itself and/or with the binder, and<br>
(b) as photosensitive acid donor an sulfonate derivative of formula I, II or III.<br>
The composition may comprise additionally to the component (b) other photosensitive acid<br>
donors (b1), other photoinitiators (d) and/or (c) other additives.<br>
Especially preferred as acid-curable resins (a5) are amino resins, such as non-etherified or etherified melamine, urea, guanidine or biuret resins, especially methylated melamine resins or butylated melamine resins, corresponding glycolurils and urones. By "resins" in this con¬text, there are to be understood both customary technical mixtures, which generally also comprise oligomers, and pure and high purity compounds. N-hexa(methoxymethyl) melam¬ine and tetramethoxymethyl glucoril and N,N'-dimethoxymethylurone are the acid-curable resins given the greatest preference.<br>
The concentration of the compound of formula I, II or III in negative resists in general is from 0.1 to 30, preferably up to 20, percent by weight, based on the total solids content of the compositions.   From 1 to 15 percent by weight is especially preferred.<br>
Where appropriate, the negative compositions may comprise a film-forming polymeric binder (a4). This binder is preferably an alkali-soluble phenolic resin. Well suited for this purpose are, for example, novolaks, derived from an aldehyde, for example acetaldehyde or furfural-dehyde, but especially from formaldehyde, and a phenol, for example unsubstituted phenol,<br><br>
mono- or di-chlorosubstituted phenol, such as p-chlorophenol, phenol mono- or di-substituted by CrC9alkyl, such as o-, m- or p-cresol, the various xylenols, p-tert-butylphenoi, p-nonylphenol, p-phenylphenol, resorcinol, bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)methane or 2,2-bis(4~hy-droxyphenyl)propane. Also suitable are homo- and co-poiymers based on ethylenically un¬saturated phenols, for example homopolymers of vinyl- and 1-propenyl-substituted phenols, such as p-vinylphenol or p-(1-propenyl)phenol or copolymers of these phenols with one or more ethylenically unsaturated materials, for example styrenes. The amount of binder should generally be from 30 to 95 percent by weight or, preferably, from 40 to 80 percent by weight<br>
An especially preferred negative resist composition comprises from 0.5 to 15 percent by weight of an sulfonate derivative of formula I, II or III (component (b)), from 40 to 99 percent by weight of a phenolic resin as binder (component (a4)), for example one of those mentioned above, and from 0.5 to 30 percent by weight of a melamine resin (component (a5)) as crosslinking agent, the percentages relating to the solids content of the composition. With novolak or especially with polyvinyl phenol as binder, a negative resist having especially good properties is obtained.<br>
Sulfonate derivatives can also be used as acid generators, which can be activated photoche-mically, for the acid-catalysed crosslinking of, for example, poly(glycidyl)methacrylates in ne¬gative resist systems. Such crosslinking reactions are described, for example, by Chae et a/, in Pollimo 1993, 17(3), 292.<br>

The positive and the negative resist compositions may comprise in addition to the photosensitive acid donor compound of formula I, II or III further photosensitive acid donor compounds (b1), further additives (c), other photoinitiators (d), and/or sensitizers (e). Therefore, subject of the invention also are chemically amplified resist compositions as described above, in addition to components (a) and (b), or components (a1), (a2), (a3) and (b), or components (a4), (a5) and (b) comprising further additives (c), further photosensitive acid donor compounds (b1), other photoinitiators (d), and/or sensitizers (e).<br><br>
Sulfonate derivatives of the present invention in the positive and negative resist can aiso be used together with other, known photolatent acids (b1), for example, onium salts, 6-nitrobenzylsulfonates, bis-sulfonyl diazomethane compounds, cyano group-containing oximesulfonate compounds, etc..

The added amount of the nitrogen-containing basic compounds is usually from 0.001 to 10 parts by weight, preferably from 0.01 to 5 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the photosensitive resin composition (excluding the solvent). If the amount thereof is smaller than 0.001 part by weight, the effects of the present invention cannot be obtained. On the other hand, if it exceeds 10 parts by weight, reduced sensitivity and impaired develo-pability at unexposed parts are liable to be caused.<br>
The composition can further contain a basic organic compound which decomposes under actinic radiation ("suicide base") such as for example described in EP 710885, US 5663035, US 5595855, US 5525453, and EP 611998.<br>

Spectral sensitizers (e) may be further added to sensitize the photo latent acid to exhibit ab¬sorption in a region of longer wavelengths than far ultaviolet, whereby the photosensitive<br><br>

These spectral sensitizers can be used also as light absorbers for absorbing the far ultraviol¬et emitted by a light source.   In this case, the light absorber reduces light reflection from the substrate and lessens the influence of multiple reflection within the resist film, thereby dimini¬shing the effect of standing waves.

Such compounds may also be used<br><br>
in combination with the sulfonate derivatives of the formulae I, II or III according to the in* vention in positive or negative resists.<br>
Usually, for the application to a substrate of the photosensitive composition of the present in* vention, the composition is dissolved in an appropriate solvent. Preferred examples of these solvents include ethylene dichloride, cyclohexanone, cyclopentanone, 2-heptanone, 7-butyrolactone, methyl ethyl ketone, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, 2-methoxyethyl acetate, 2-ethoxyethyl acetate, 2-ethoxyethanol, diethyl glycol dimethyl ether, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate, propylene glycol monomethyl ether, propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate, toluene, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, methyl lactate, ethyl lactate, methyl methoxypropionate, ethyl ethoxypropionate, methyl pyruvate, ethyl pyruvate, propyl pyruvate, N, N-dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, N-methylpyrrolidone, and tetrahydrofuran. These solvents may be used alone or as mixtures. Preferred examples of the solvents are esters, such as 2-methoxyethyl acetate, ethylene glycolmonoethyl ether acetate, propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate, methyl methoxypropionate, ethyl ethoxypropionate, and ethyl lactate. Use of such solvents is advantageous because the sulfonate derivatives represented by formulae I, II or III according to the present invention have good compatibility therewith and better solubility therein.<br>
A surfactant can be added to the solvent. Examples of suitable surfactants include nonionic surfactants, such as polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers, e.g. polyoxyethylene lauryl ether, polyoxy-ethylene stearyl ether, polyoxyethylene acetyl ether, and polyoxyethylene oleyl ether; polyox¬yethylene alkylaryl ethers, e.g. polyoxyethylene, octylphenol ether and polyoxyethylene non-ylphenol ether; polyoxyethylene/polyoxypropylene block copolymers, sorbitan/fatty acid es¬ters, e.g. sorbitan monolaurate, sorbitan monopalmitate, sorbitan monostearate, sorbitan mo-nooleate, sorbitan trioleate; fluorochemical surfactants such as F-top EF301, EF303, and EF352 (manufactured by New Akita Chemical Company, Japan). Megafac F171 and F17.3 (manufactured by Dainippon Ink &amp; Chemicals, Inc. Japan), Fluorad FC 430 and FC431 (ma¬nufactured by Sumitomo 3M Ltd., Japan), Asahi Guard AG710 and Surflon S-382, SC101, SC102, SC103, SC104, SC105 , and SC106 (manufactured by Asahi Grass Col, Ltd., Jap¬an); organosiloxane polymer KP341 (manufactured by Shin-Etsu Chemical Co., Ltd., Japan); and acrylic or methacrylic (co)polymers Poly-flow Now.75 and N0.95 (manufactured by Kyoeisha Chemical Co., Ltd., Japan). Other examples are described in JP-A-2Q01-318459, JP-A-2002-6483. The added amount of the surfactant usually is 2 parts by weight or lower,<br><br>
desirably 0.5 part by weight or lower, per 100 parts by weight of the solid components of the composition of the present invention. The surfactants may be added alone or in combination of two or more thereof.<br>
The solution is uniformly applied to a substrate by means of known coating methods, for ex¬ample by spin-coating, immersion, knife coating, curtain pouring techniques, brush applica¬tion, spraying and roller coating. It is also possible to apply the photosensitive layer to a temporary, flexible support and then to coat the final substrate by coating transfer (lami¬nating).<br>
The amount applied (coating thickness) and the nature of the substrate (coating substrate) are dependent on the desired field of application. The range of coating thicknesses can in principle include values from approximately 0.01 ^m to more than 100 jim.<br>
After the coating operation generally the solvent is removed by heating, resulting in a layer of the photoresist on the substrate. The drying temperature must of course be lower than the temperature at which certain components of the resist might react or decompose. In gener¬al, drying temperatures are in the range from 60 to 160°C.<br>
The resist coating is then irradiated image-wise. The expression "image-wise irradiation" in¬cludes irradiation in a predetermined pattern using actinic radiation, i.e. both irradiation through a mask containing a predetermined pattern, for example a transparency, a chrome mask or a reticle, and irradiation using a laser beam or electron beam that writes directly on¬to the resist surface, for example under the control of a computer, and thus produces an ima¬ge. Another way to produce a pattern is by interference of two beams or images as used for example in holographic applications. It is also possible to use masks made of liquid crystals that can be addressed pixel by pixel to generate digital images, as is, for example described by A. Bertsch; J.Y. Jezequel; J.C. Andre in Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology A: Chemistry 1997,107 pp. 275-281 and by K. P. Nicolay in Offset Printing 1997, 6, pp. 34-37.<br>
After the irradiation and, if necessary, thermal treatment, the irradiated sites (in the case of positive resists) or the non-irradiated sites (in the case of negative resists) of the composition are removed in a manner known per se using a developer.<br>
In order to accelerate the catalytic reaction and hence the development of a sufficient differ¬ence in solubility between the irradiated and unirradiated sections of the resist coating in the<br><br>
developer, the coating is preferably heated before being developed. The heating can also be carried out or begun during the irradiation. Temperatures of from 60 to 160°C are prefer¬ably used. The period of time depends on the heating method and, if necessary, the optim¬um period can be determined easily by a person skilled in the art by means of a few routine experiments. It is generally from a few seconds to several minutes. For example, a period of from 10 to 300 seconds is very suitable when a hotplate is used and from 1 to 30 minutes when a convection oven is used. It is important for the latent acid donors according to the invention in the unirradiated sites on the resist to be stable under those processing conditi¬ons.<br>
The coating is then developed, the portions of the coating that, after irradiation, are more sol¬uble in the developer being removed. If necessary, slight agitation of the workpiece, gentle brushing of the coating in the developer bath or spray developing can accelerate that pro¬cess step. The aqueous-alkaline developers customary in resist technology may, for exam¬ple, be used for the development. Such developers comprise, for example, sodium or pot¬assium hydroxide, the corresponding carbonates, hydrogen carbonates, silicates or metasili-cates, but preferably metal-free bases, such as ammonia or amines, for example ethylamine, n-propylamine, diethylamine, di-n-propylamine, triethylamine, methyl diethylamine, alkanola-mines, for example dimethyl ethanolamine, triethanolamine, quaternary ammonium hydroxides, for example tetramethylammonium hydroxide or tetraethylammonium hydroxide. The developer solutions are generally up to 0.5 N, but are usually diluted in suitable manner before use. For example solutions having a normality of approximately 0.1 -0.3 are well suited. The choice of developer depends on the nature of the photocurable surface coating, especially on the nature of the binder used or of the resulting photolysis products. The aqu¬eous developer solutions may, if necessary, also comprise relatively small amounts of wetting agents and/or organic solvents. Typical organic solvents that can be added to the developer fluids are, for example, cyclohexanone, 2-ethoxyethanol, toluene, acetone, isopro-panol and also mixtures of two or more of these solvents. A typical aqueous/organic deve¬loper system is based on ButylcellosolveRTM/water.<br>
Subject of the invention also is a process for the preparation of a photoresist by<br>
(1)	applying to a substrate a composition as described above;<br>
(2)	post apply baking the composition at temperatures between 60°C and 160°C;<br>
(3)	image-wise irradiating with light of wavelengths between 10 nm and 1500 nm;<br><br>
(4)	optionally post exposure baking the composition at temperatures between 60°C and 160°C; and<br>
(5)	developing with a solvent or with an aqueous alkaline developer.<br>
Preferred is a process, wherein the image-wise irradiation is carried out with monochromatic or polychromatic radiation in the wavelength range from 150 to 450 nm, in particular in the range from 190 to 260 nm.<br>
The photoresist compositions can be used on all substrates and with all exposure techniques known to the person skilled in the art. For example, semiconductor substrates can be used, such as silicon, gallium arsenide, germanium, indium antimonide; furthermore substrate covered by oxide or nitride layers, such as silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, titanium nitride, siloxanes, as well as metal substrates and metal coated substrates with metals such as aluminium, copper, tungsten, etc. The substrate can also be coated with polymeric materials, for example with organic antireflective coatings, insulation layers and dielectric coatings from polymeric materials prior to coating with the photoresist.<br>
The photoresist layer can be exposed by all common techniques, such as direct writing, i.e. with a laser beam or projection lithography in step- and repeat mode or scanning mode, or by contact printing through a mask.<br>
In case of projection lithography a wide range of optical conditions can be used such as coherent, partial coherent or incoherent irradiation. This includes off-axis illumination techniques, for example annular illumination and quadrupol illumination where the radiation is allowed to pass only certain regions of the lens, excluding the lens center.<br>
The mask used to replicate the pattern can be a hard mask or a flexible mask. The mask can include transparent, semitransparent and opaque patterns. The pattern size can include also patterns which are at or below the resolution limit of the projection optics and placed on the mask in a certain way in order to modify the aerial image, intensity and phase modulation of the irradiation after having passed the mask. This includes phase shift masks and half-tone phase shift masks.<br><br>
The patterning process of the photoresist composition can be used to generate patterns of any desired geometry and shape, for example dense and isolated lines, contact holes, trenches, dots, etc.<br>
The photoresists according to the invention have excellent lithographic properties, in particular a high sensitivity, and high resist transparency for the imaging radiation.<br>
Possible areas of use of the composition according to the invention are as follows: use as photoresists for electronics, such as etching resists, ion-implantation resist, electroplating resists or solder resists, the manufacture of integrated circuits or thin film transistor-resist (TFT); the manufacture of printing plates, such as offset printing plates or screen printing stencils, use in the etching of mouldings or in stereolithography or holography techniques, which are employed for various applications, for example, 3D optical information storage described in J. Photochem. Photobio.A, 158, 163 (2003), Chem. Mater. 14, 3656 (2002). The composition according to the invention is also suitable for making inter-metal dielectrics layer, buffer layer, passivation coat of semiconductor devices and suitable for making waveguide for optoelectronics. For MEMS (micro electro mechanical systems) application, the composition according to the invention can be used as etching resist, mold for material deposition, and three dimensional objects of device itself. The coating substrates and pro¬cessing conditions vary accordingly. Such example is described in US 6391523.<br>
The compounds of formula I, II and III according to the present invention, in combination with a sensitizer compound as described above, can also be used in holographic data storage (HDS) systems as for example described in WO 03/021358.<br>
The compositions according to the invention are also outstandingly suitable as coating com¬positions for substrates of all types, including wood, textiles, paper, ceramics, glass, plastics, such as polyesters, polyethylene terephthalate, polyolefins or cellulose acetate, especially in the form of films, but especially for coating metals, such as Ni, Fe, Zn, Mg, Co or especially Cu and Al, and also Si, silicon oxides or nitrides, to which an image is to be applied by means of image-wise irradiation.<br>
The invention relates also to the use of compounds of formula I, II or III as photolatent acid donors in compositions that can be crosslinked under the action of an acid and/or as<br><br>
dissolution enhancers in compositions wherein the solubility is increased under the action of an acid.<br>
Subject of the invention further is a process of crosslinking compounds that can be crosslink-ed under the action of an acid, which method comprises adding a compound of formula I, II or III to the above-mentioned compounds and irradiating imagewise or over the whole area with light having a wavelength of 10-1500 nm.<br>
The invention relates also to the use of compounds of formulae I, II or III as photosensitive acid donors in the preparation of pigmented and non-pigmented surface coatings, adhesives, laminating adhesives, structural adhesives, pressure-sensitive adhesives, printing inks, printing plates, relief printing plates, planographic printing plates, intaglio printing plates, processless printing plates, screen printing stencils, dental compositions, colour filters, spacers, electroluminescence displays and liquid crystal displays (LCD), waveguides, optical switches, color proofing systems, resists, photoresists for electronics, electroplating resists, etch resists both for liquid and dry films, solder resist, photoresist materials for a UV and visible laser direct imaging system, photoresist materials for forming dielectric layers in a sequential build-up layer of a printed circuit board, image-recording materials, image-recording materials for recording holographic images, optical information storage or holographic data storage, decolorizing materials, decolorizing materials for image recording materials, image recording materials using microcapsules, magnetic recording materials, micromechanical parts, plating masks, etch masks, glass fibre cable coatings, microelectronic circuits; as well as to a process for the preparation for the preparation of pigmented and non-pigmented surface coatings, adhesives, laminating adhesives, structural adhesives, pressure-sensitive adhesives, printing inks, printing plates, relief printing plates, planographic printing plates, intaglio printing plates, processless printing plates, screen printing stencils, dental compositions, colour filters, spacers, electroluminescence displays and liquid crystal displays (LCD), waveguides, optical switches, color proofing systems, resists, photoresists for electronics, electroplating resists, etch resists both for liquid and dry films, solder resist, photoresist materials for a UV and visible laser direct imaging system, photoresist materials for forming dielectric layers in a sequential build-up layer of a printed circuit board, image-recording materials, image-recording materials for recording holographic images, optical information storage or holographic data storage, decolorizing materials, decolorizing materials for image recording materials, image recording materials using microcapsules, magnetic recording materials, micromechanical parts, plating masks, etch masks, glass fibre cable coatings, microelectronic circuits.<br><br>
Subject of the invention is also the use of compounds of formulae I, II or Hi as photosensitive acid donors in the preparation of colour filters or chemically amplified resist materials; as well as to a process for the preparation of colour filters or chemically amplified resist materials.<br>
The invention further pertains to a color filter prepared by providing red, green and blue picture elements and a black matrix, all comprising a photosensitive resin and a pigment and/or dye on a transparent substrate and providing a transparent electrode either on the surface of the substrate or on the surface of the color filter layer, wherein said photosensitive resin comprises compounds of formula I, II or III according to claim 1 as photosensitive acid donors.<br>
The person skilled in the art is aware of suitable pigments or dyes to provide the color elements, as well as the black matrix and corresponding suitable resins as shown in, for examples, JP-A-9-203806, JP-A-10-282650, JP-A-10-333334, JP-A-11-194494, JP-A-10-203037, JP-A-2003-5371.<br>
As already mentioned above, in photocrosslinkable compositions, sulfonate derivatives act as latent curing catalysts: when irradiated with light they release acid which catalyses the crosslinking reaction. In addition, the acid released by the radiation can, for example, catalyse the removal of suitable acid-sensitive protecting groups from a polymer structure, or the cleavage of polymers containing acid-sensitive groups in the polymer backbone. Other applications are, for example, colour-change systems based on a change in the pH or in the solubility of, for example, a pigment protected by acid-sensitive protecting groups.<br>
Sulfonate derivatives according to the present invention can also be used to produce so-called "print-out" images when the compound is used together with a colourant that changes colour when the pH changes, as described e.g. in JP Hei 4 328552-A or in US 5237059. Such color-change systems can be used according to EP 199672 also to monitor goods that are sensitive to heat or radiation.<br>
In addition to a colour change, it is possible during the acid-catalysed deprotection of soluble pigment molecules (as described e.g. in EP 648770, EP 648817 and EP 742255) for the pig¬ment crystals to be precipitated; this can be used in the production of colour filters as descri¬bed e.g. in EP 654711 or print out images and indicator applications, when the colour of the latent pigment precursor differs from that of the precipitated pigment crystal.<br><br>
Compositions using pH sensitive dyes or latent pigments in combination with sulfonate derivatives can be used as indicators for electromagnetic radiation, such as gamma radiation, electron beams, UV- or visible light, or simple throw away dosimeters. Especially for light, that is invisible to the human eye, like UV- or IR-light, such dosimeters are of interest.<br>
Finally, sulfonate derivatives that are sparingly soluble in an aqueous-alkaline developer can be rendered soluble in the developer by means of light-induced conversion into the free acid, with the result that they can be used as solubility enhancers in combination with suitable film-forming resins.<br>
Resins which can be crosslinked by acid catalysis and accordingly by the photolatent acids of formula I, II or III according to the invention, are, for example, mixtures of polyfunctional al¬cohols or hydroxy-group-containing acrylic and polyester resins, or partially hydrolysed poly-vinylacetals or polyvinyl alcohols with polyfunctional acetal derivatives. Under certain condi¬tions, for example the acid-catalysed self-condensation of acetal-functionalised resins is also possible.<br>
Suitable acid-curable resins in general are all resins whose curing can be accelerated by ac¬id catalysts, such as aminoplasts or phenolic resole resins. These resins are for example melamine, urea, epoxy, phenolic, acrylic, polyester and alkyd resins, but especially mixtures of acrylic, polyester or alkyd resins with a melamine resin. Also included are modified surfa¬ce-coating resins, such as acrylic-modified polyester and alkyd resins. Examples of indivi¬dual types of resins that are covered by the expression acrylic, polyester and alkyd resins are described, for example, in Wagner, Sarx, Lackkunstharze (Munich, 1971), pp. 86-123 and pp. 229-238, or in Ullmann, Encyclopadie der techn. Chemie, 4th Ed., Vol. 15 (1978), pp. 613-628, or Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Verlag Chemie, 1991, Vol. 18, p. 360 ff., Vol.A19, p. 371 ff..<br>
In coating applications the surface coating preferably comprises an amino resin. Examples thereof are etherified or non-etherified melamine, urea, guanidine or biuret resins. Acid ca¬talysis is especially important in the curing of surface coatings comprising etherified amino resins, such as methylated or butylated melamine resins (N-methoxymethyl- or N-butoxyme-<br><br>
thyi-melamine) or methylated/butylated glycolurils. Examples of other resin compositions are mixtures of polyfunctional alcohols or hydroxy-group-containing acrylic and polyester resins, or partially hydrolysed polyvinyl acetate or polyvinyl alcohol with polyfunctional dihydropropanyl derivatives, such as derivatives of 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-carboxylic acid. Polysiloxanes can also be crosslinked using acid catalysis. These siloxane group-containing resins can, for example, either undergo self-condensation by means of acid-catalysed hydrolysis or be crosslinked with a second component of the resin, such as a polyfunctional alcohol, a hydroxy-group-containing acrylic or polyester resin, a partially hydrolysed polyvinyl acetal or a polyvinyl alcohol. This type of polycondensation of polysiloxanes is described, for example, in J J. Lebrun, H. Pode, Comprehensive Polymer Science, Vol. 5, p. 593, Pergamon Press, Oxford, 1989. Other cationically polymerisable materials that are suitable for the preparation of surface coatings are ethylenically unsaturated compounds polymerisable by a cationic mechanism, such as vinyl ethers, for example methyl vinyl ether, isobutyl vinyl ether, trimethylolpropane trivinyl ether, ethylene glycol divinyl ether; cyclic vinyl ethers, for example 3,4-dihydro-2-formyl-2H-pyran (dimeric acrolein) or the 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-carboxylic acid ester of 2-hydroxymethyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran; vinyl esters, such as vinyl acetate and vinyl stearate, mono- and di-olefins, such as a-methylstyrene, N-vinylpyrrolidone or N-vinylcarbazole.<br>
For certain purposes, resin mixtures having monomeric or oligomeric constituents containing polymerisable unsaturated groups are used. Such surface coatings can also be cured using compounds of formula I, II or III. In that process, radical polymerisation initiators or photoini-tiators can additionally be used. The former initiate polymerisation of the unsaturated groups during heat treatment, the latter during UV irradiation.<br>
The invention also relates to a composition comprising<br>
(a)	a compound which cures upon the action of an acid or a compound whose solubility is increased upon the action of an acid; and<br>
(b)	as photosensitive acid donor, at least one compound of the formula I, II or III as described above.<br>
The compounds of formulae I, II or III respectively, are generally added to the compositions in an amount from 0.1 to 30 % by weight, for example from 0.5 to 10 % by weight, especially from 1 to 5 % by weight.<br><br>
According to the invention, the compounds of formula I, II or III can be used together with further photosensitive acid donor compounds (b1)t further photoinitiators (d), sensitisers (e) and/or additives (c).<br>
Suitable photosensitive acid donor compounds (b1), sensitizers (e) and addtives (c) are described above.<br>

to column 21, line 35. Other examples are trihalomethyltriazine derivatives or hexaarylbisi-midazolyl compounds. Further examples for additional photoinitiators are borate compounds, as for example described in US 4772530, EP 775706, GB 2307474, GB 2307473 and GB 2304472. The borate compounds preferably are used in combination with electron acceptor compounds, such as, for example dye cations, or thioxanthone derivatives.<br>

The surface coatings may be solutions or dispersions of the surface-coating resin in an orga¬nic solvent or in water, but they may also be solventless. Of special interest are surface coatings having a low solvent content, so-called "high solids surface coatings", and powder coating compositions. The surface coatings may be clear lacquers, as used, for example, in the automobile industry as finishing lacquers for multilayer coatings. They may also compri¬se pigments and/or fillers, which may be inorganic or organic compounds, and metal pow¬ders for metal effect finishes.<br>
The surface coatings may also comprise relatively small amounts of special additives custo¬mary in surface-coating technology, for example flow improvers, thixotropic agents, leveling agents, antifoaming agents, wetting agents, adhesion promoters, light stabilisers, antioxi¬dants, or sensitisers.<br>
UV absorbers, such as those of the hydroxyphenyl-benzotriazole, hydroxyphenyl-benzophe-none, oxalic acid amide or hydroxyphenyl-s-triazine type may be added to the compositions according to the invention as light stabilisers. Individual compounds or mixtures of those compounds can be used with or without the addition of sterically hindered amines (HALS).<br>

Such light stabilisers can also be added, for example, to an adjacent surface-coating layer from which they gradually diffuse into the layer of stoving lacquer to be protected. The adja¬cent surface-coating layer may be a primer under the stoving lacquer or a finishing lacquer over the stoving lacquer.<br>
It is also possible to add to the resin, for example, photosensitisers which shift or increase the spectral sensitivity so that the irradiation period can be reduced and/or other light sources can be used. Examples of photosensitisers are aromatic ketones or aromatic aldehydes (as described, for example, in US 4017652), 3-acyl-coumarins (as described, for example, in US 4366228, EP 738928, EP 22188), keto-coumarines (as described e.g. in US 5534633, EP 538997, JP 8272095-A), styryl-coumarines (as described e.g. in EP 624580), 3-(aroyimeth-ylene)-thiazolines, thioxanthones, condensed aromatic compounds, such as perylene, aro¬matic amines (as described, for example, in US 4069954 or WO 96/41237) or cationic and basic colourants (as described, for example, in US 4026705), for example eosine, rhodanine and erythrosine colourants, as well as dyes and pigments as described for example in JP 8320551-A, EP747771, JP7036179-A, EP619520, JP6161109-A, JP6043641, JP 6035198-A, WO 93/15440, EP 568993, JP 5005005-A, JP 5027432-A, JP5301910-A, JP 4014083-A, JP 4294148-A, EP 359431, EP 103294, US 4282309, EP 39025, EP 5274, EP 727713, EP 726497 or DE 2027467.<br>
Other customary additives are - depending on the intended use - optical brighteners, fillers, pigments, colourants, wetting agents or flow improvers and adhesion promoters.<br>
For curing thick and pigmented coatings, the addition of micro glass beads or powdered glass fibres, as described in US 5013768, is suitable.<br>
Sulfonate derivatives can also be used, for example, in hybrid systems. These systems are based on formulations that are fully cured by two different reaction mechanisms. Examples thereof are systems that comprise components that are capable of undergoing an acid-cata¬lysed crosslinking reaction or polymerisation reaction, but that also comprise further compo-<br><br>
nents that crosslink by a second mechanism. Examples of the second mechanism are radi¬cal full cure, oxidative crosslinking or humidity-initiated crosslinking. The second curing mechanism may be initiated purely thermally, if necessary with a suitable catalyst, or also by means of light using a second photoinitiator. Suitable additional photoinitiators are described above.<br>
If the composition comprises a radically crosslinkable component, the curing process, espe¬cially of compositions that are pigmented (for example with titanium dioxide), can also be as¬sisted by the addition of a component that is radical-forming under thermal conditions, such as an azo compound, for example 2,2'-azobis(4-methoxy-2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile), a triaze-ne, a diazosulfide, a pentazadiene or a peroxy compound, such as, for example, a hydroper¬oxide or peroxycarbonate, for example tert-butyl hydroperoxide, as described, for example, in EP 245639. The addition of redox initiators, such as cobalt salts, enables the curing to be assisted by oxidative crosslinking with oxygen from the air.<br>
The surface coating can be applied by one of the methods customary in the art, for example by spraying, painting or immersion. When suitable surface coatings are used, electrical ap¬plication, for example by anodic electrophoretic deposition, is also possible. After drying, the surface coating film is irradiated. If necessary, the surface coating film is then fully cured by means of heat treatment.<br>
The compounds of formulae I, II or III can also be used for curing mouldings made from com¬posites. A composite consists of a self-supporting matrix material, for example a glass fibre fabric, impregnated with the photocuring formulation.<br>
It is known from EP 592139 that sulfonate derivatives can be used as acid generators, which can be activated by light in compositions that are suitable for the surface treatment and clea¬ning of glass, aluminium and steel surfaces. The use of such compounds in organosilane systems results in compositions that have significantly better storage stability than those ob¬tained when the free acid is used. The compounds of formula I, II or III are also suitable for this application.<br>
The sulfonate derivatives of the present invention can also be used to shape polymers that undergo an acid induced transition into a state where they have the required properties using<br><br>
photolithography. For instance the sulfonate derivatives can be used to pattern conjugated emissive polymers as described, for example, in M.L. Renak; C. Bazan; D. Roitman; Advanced materials 1997, 9, 392. Such patterned emissive polymers can be used to manu¬facture microscalar patterned Light Emitting Diodes (LED) which can be used to manufacture displays and data storage media. In a similar way precursors for polyimides (e.g. polyimid precursors with acid labile protecting groups that change solubility in the developer) can be irradiated to form patterned polyimide layers which can serve as protective coatings, insulating layers and buffer layers in the production of microchips and printed circuit boards.<br>
The formulations of the invention may also be used as conformal coatings, photoimagable insulating layers and dielectrics as they are used in sequential build up systems for printed circuit boards, stress buffer layers in the manufacturing of integrated circuits.<br>
It is known that conjugated polymers like, e.g. polyanilines can be converted from semicon-ductive to conductive state by means of proton doping. The sulfonate derivatives of the present invention can also be used to imagewise irradiate compositions comprising such conjugated polymers in order to form conducting structures (exposed areas) embedded in insulating material (non exposed areas). These materials can be used as wiring and connecting parts for the production of electric and electronic devices.<br>
Suitable radiation sources for the compositions comprising compounds of formula I, II or III are radiation sources that emit radiation of a wavelength of approximately from 150 to 1500, for example from 180 to 1000, or preferably from 190 to 700 nanometers as well as e-beam radiation and high-energy electromagnetic radiation such as X-rays. Both, point sources and planiform projectors (lamp carpets) are suitable. Examples are: carbon arc lamps, xenon arc lamps, medium pressure, high pressure and low pressure mercury lamps, optionally do¬ped with metal halides (metal halide lamps), microwave-excited metal vapour lamps, excimer lamps, superactinic fluorescent tubes, fluorescent lamps, argon filament lamps, electronic flash lamps, photographic flood lights, electron beams and X-ray beams generated by means of synchrotrons or laser plasma. The distance between the radiation source and the substrate according to the invention to be irradiated can vary, for example, from 2 cm to 150 cm, according to the intended use and the type and/or strength of the radiation source. Suitable radiaiton sources are especially mercury vapour lamps, especially medium and high pressure mercury lamps, from the radiation of which emission lines at other wavelengths can,<br><br>
if desired, be filtered out. That is especially the case for relatively short wavelength radi¬ation. It is, however, also possible to use low energy lamps (for example fluorescent tubes) that are capable of emitting in the appropriate wavelength range. An example thereof is the Philips TL03 lamp. Another type of radiation source that can be used are the light emitting diodes (LED) that emitt at different wavelengths throughout the whole spectrum either as small band emitting source or as broad band (white light) source. Also suitable are laser radiation sources, for example excimer lasers, such as Kr-F lasers for irradiation at 248 nm, Ar-F lasers at 193 nm, or F2 laser at 157 nm. Lasers in the visible range and in the infrared range can also be used. Especially suitable is radiation of the mercury i, h and g lines at wavelengths of 365, 405 and 436 nanometers. As a light source further EUV (Extreme Ultra Violet) at 13 nm is also suitable. A suitable laser-beam source is, for example, the argon-ion laser, which emits radiation at wavelengths of 454, 458, 466, 472, 478, 488 and 514 nanometers. Nd-YAG-lasers emitting light at 1064 nm and its second and third harmonic (532 nm and 355 nm respectively) can also be used. Also suitable is, for example, a helium/cadmium laser having an emission at 442 nm or lasers that emit in the UV range. With that type of irradiation, it is not absolutely essential to use a photomask in contact with the photopolymeric coating to produce a positive or negative resist; the controlled laser beam is capable of writing directly onto the coating. For that purpose the high sensitivity of the materials according to the invention is very advantageous, allowing high writing speeds at relatively low intensities. On irradiation, the sulfonate derivatives in the composition in the irradiated sections of the surface coating decompose to form the acids.<br>
In contrast to customary UV curing with high-intensity radiation, with the compounds accor¬ding to the invention activation is achieved under the action of radiation of relatively low in¬tensity. Such radiation includes, for example, daylight (sunlight), and radiation sources equivalent to daylight. Sunlight differs in spectral composition and intensity from the light of the artificial radiation sources customarily used in UV curing. The absorption characteristics of the compounds according to the invention are as well suitable for exploiting sunlight as a natural source of radiation for curing. Daylight-equivalent artificial light sources that can be used to activate the compounds according to the invention are to be understood as being projectors of low intensity, such as certain fluorescent lamps, for example the Philips TL05 special fluorescent lamp or the Philips TL09 special fluorescent lamp. Lamps having a high daylight content and daylight itself are especially capable of curing the surface of a surface-coating layer satisfactorily in a tack-free manner. In that case expensive curing apparatus is<br><br>
superfluous and the compositions can be used especially for exterior finishes. Curing with daylight or daylight-equivalent light sources is an energy-saving method and prevents emis¬sions of volatile organic components in exterior applications. In contrast to the conveyor belt method, which is suitable for flat components, daylight curing can also be used for exterior finishes on static or fixed articles and structures.<br>
The surface coating to be cured can be exposed directly to sunlight or daylight-equivalent light sources. The curing can, however, also take place behind a transparent layer (e.g. a pane of glass or a sheet of plastics).<br>

Kasei, Japan) 4.00 parts of the photoacid generator to be tested The resist formulation is spin-coated onto a silicone wafer, on which a bottom antireflective coating (XHRiC-11 provided by Nissan Chemical Industries, Japan) is applied beforehand, and soft-baked for 60 seconds at 90°C on a hotplate to obtain a film thickness of 1000 nm. The resist film is then exposed to i-line radiation of 365 nm wavelength through a narrow band interference filter and a multidensity quartz mask using an Ushio's high-pressure mercury lamp, HB-25106AP, and a mask aligner Canon PLA-501F. The samples then are post-exposure-baked for 60 seconds at 90°C on a hotplate and developed. The Dose to Clear (E0), which is the dose just sufficient to completely remove the resist film with 60 seconds immersion development in 2.38 % aqueous tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide developer (NMD-3 provided by TOK), is determined from the measured contrast curve. The smaller the required dose the higher sensitive is the resist formulation.<br><br>

velength through a narrow band interference filter and a multidensity quartz mask using an Ushio's high pressure mercury lamp, UXM-501MD, and a mask aligner Canon PLA-521.
