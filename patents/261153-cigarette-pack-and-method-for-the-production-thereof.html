				<td>Cigarette pack and method for the production thereof Description<br>
The invention relates to a pack containing at least one elongate item, in particular a cigarette, which is surrounded by a blank that is made of foldable material and which forms two partial packs. The invention also relates to technical measures for the production of such packs and chains comprising a plurality of packs.<br>
The present pack serves to accommodate individual, elongate items, such as cigarettes, cigarillos, cigars, but also such objects as writing utensils. The pack is constructed such that each pack accommodates only one such item, or a microgroup of two, possibly three items. A plurality of packs are connected to one another to form a continuous chain such that an individual pack or a plurality of packs can be separated from this chain as needed.<br>
The object of the invention is to further develop and improve the aforementioned packs, the pack chains they comprise, their packaging material and the method for producing the packs relative to the prior art.<br>
This object is solved by the pack according to the invention with the following features:<br>
a)	the partial packs comprise a common (single-piece) blank.<br>
b)	the partial packs are folded against one another by being folded over along a folding line such that cavities formed by both partial packs complement each other to create a common interior space for the item.<br>
The pack for accommodating one item or, if necessary, a plurality of items thus comprises a single blank which, due to appropriate preshaping, embossing and stamping, constitutes the partial packs. The partial packs are folded over to press against one another, thus forming the complete pack.<br>
One special feature is that one of the partial packs consists of two sections, namely complementary, foldable (cover) tabs, which can be folded over onto the other (single-piece) partial pack at transverse edges or transverse walls at its opposite ends. The sections of the partial pack configured as cover tabs form an interlocking overlap in such a manner that one of the cover tabs can serve as an opening means of the pack.<br>
The packs or partial packs are made from a continuous web of foldable packaging material with heightened dimensional stability, in particular thin cardboard. The web is<br><br>
configured with embossed lines running in the transverse direction and with folding lines for the transverse walls in such a manner that the continuous, single-piece partial pack is formed in a central material strip and material strips for the cover tabs of the other partial pack are formed at either edge. In addition, the material web is provided with transverse, parallel perforated lines for separating the individual packs.<br>
The folding lines for the transverse walls are designed such that, when the cover tabs are folded, the transverse walls are automatically created in accordance with the predetermined cross-sectional contour, that is to say having in particular a trapezoid, quadrangular or rounded shape.<br>
Further special features of the invention relate to the production method and the design of pack chains made from a row of packs. Exemplary embodiments of the invention will be described in more detail in the following as based on the drawings, which show:<br><br>

FtG. 26:    an illustration analogous to FIG. 21 to FIG. 23 for a pack with two adjacent<br>
cigarettes.<br>
The main point of interest is the packaging and presentation of elongate items, in particular cigarettes 10. Each pack 11 contains one item or cigarette 10, or a microgroup of two cigarettes 10, for example. The pack 11 itself comprises a single blank 12 made of foldable packaging material possessing sufficient dimensional stability, in particular thin cardboard.<br>
The blanks 12 is pre-shaped by deformation, in particular by the embossing of the packaging material in such a manner that by folding over subsections of the blank 12 it is possible to form the pack 11 which completely surrounds the item or cigarette 10. The pack 11 is formed by two partial packs 13, 14, which preferably have the same cross section. The lower, or front partial pack 13 shown in FIG. 5 to FIG. 10 extends along the full length of the cigarette 10. The upper, or rear partial pack 14 comprises two pack sections that assume the function of cover tabs 15, 16. In the case of the single-piece configuration of the elongate blank 12, the partial pack 13 forms a middle region. The cover tabs 15, 16 are connected to both ends of the partial pack 13. When the cover tabs 15, 16 are folded over by 180', they lie on the top side of the partial pack 13 or of the cigarette 10, thus completing the pack 11. The cover tabs 15, 16 form a mutual overlap 38. The shorter cover tab 16 lies on the outside on top of cover tab 15 and is thus employed to open the pack 11 for the removal of its contents (FIG. 22, FIG. 23).<br>
The blanks 12 are shaped by deformation of the packaging material and, due to folding edges formed by embossing or creasing, are shaped in such a manner that each partial pack 13, 14 has a cavity 17, 18. The two cavities 17, 18 together form an interior space for the accommodation of the item or of the cigarette 10. In an advantageous development, the cavities 17, 18 are equal in size and have the same shape, with the result that each partial pack 13. 14 has (approximately) the same cross-sectional dimension and shape. Each partial pack 13. 14 has projecting webs 19, 20 at both longitudinal sides which lie on one another when the pack 11 is closed and which are connected to one another in an appropriate manner, in particular by means of glue or thermal sealing.<br>
The cavities 17, 18, and thus the interior space of the pack 11, may be of different shape. In the special embodiment pursuant to FiG. 12. FIG. 13 and 14, the cavities 17, 18 have a trapezoidal-shaped cross section. The elongate, strip-like blank 12 has four parallel<br><br>
folding lines 21. 22. 23, 24 which are embossed or creased in the material. Folding lines 21 ...24 are arranged at equal distances from each other. Folding lines 22 and 23 delimit a base wall 25. Arranged adjacent thereto are oblique side walls 26, 27. These are delimited laterally by folding lines 21 and 24 from the fin-like projecting webs 19, 20.<br>
One special feature involves transverse folding lines that are likewise formed by embossing or creasing. In the case of trapezoid-shaped cavities 17, 18, two diverging folding legs 28. 29 extend in the region of the side walls 26. 27. Two transversely directed, parallel cross-legs 30, 31 are assigned to the base wall 25. In the region of the webs 19, 20, the folding legs 28, 29 lead to an end leg 32 that is also directed transversely. This pattern of preshaped folding lines delimits the partial pack 13 from the end sections of partial pack 14, namely from cover tabs 15 and 16. The effect of the folded line pattern is such that the folding over of the cover tabs 15, 16 (FIG. 7 to FIG. 10) results in the automatic creation of trapezoid-shaped transverse walls 33. 34 at both ends of the pack 11.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment pursuant to FIG. 15 and FIG. 16, the cavities 17, 18 of both partial packs 13, 14 have a triangular-shaped cross section, resulting in an interior space of the pack 11 that is quadrangular as a whole (FIG. 16). The number of folding lines running in the longitudinal direction of the blank 12 is correspondingly smaller, namely only one folding line 21, 24 running at each margin for the purpose of delimiting the webs 19, 20 and one central folding line 35. The folding lines running transverse to the blank 12 for the purpose of delimiting the cross walls 33, 34 are designed accordingly, namely comprising diverging folding legs 28, 29 in each region of the oblique side walls 26, 27. The transverse folding lines 32 join the folding lines 28, 29 in the region of the webs 19, 20.<br>
The example FIG. 17, FIG. 18 shows a pack 11 having a rounded, (approximately) circular cross section. In this case no folding or embossed lines are provided for delimiting strip-shaped walls of the pack 11. The transverse embossment is located in the central area, namely between the lateral webs 19, 20, and comprises two arc-shaped rounded legs 36, 37 for delimiting the rounded transverse walls 33, 34. The latter are also created in each case when the cover tabs 15, 16 are folded from the original position (FIG. 15, FIG. 17) to the final position pursuant to FIG. 10.<br>
The packs 11 are furnished with a special opening aid. The cover tab 16, as a section of the partial pack 14, functions as an opening tab. To this end. the webs 19, 20 of the partial<br><br>
packs 13, 14 are detachably connected to each other in this region, in particular by means of a peel seal connection. The latter comprises the usual sealable connecting layer 39 having low adhesion, in particular consisting of wax. As can be seen from FIG. 13 to FIG. 17, the webs 19, 20 in the region of the cover tab 16 and, in addition, the transverse region of the overlap 38, are provided with this coating. The appropriate shaping of the blank 12 creates a laterally directed lappet 40 in the region of the overlap 38, which is exposed when the pack is closed 11 and can be gripped manually for opening the pack 11. With the help of the lappet 40, the cover tab 16 is pulled away from the overlap area with the cover tab 15 and from the webs 19, 20 of the partial pack 13. After the pack 11 has been completely opened, the pack contents, namely the cigarette 10, is exposed at an upper region for removal (FIG. 23). In order to separate the blank 12 from a web 43 without creating any waste material, a (corner) cut 41 having the same configuration is created opposite the lappet 40.<br>
The packaging material, or blank 12, is provided with a coating 42 covering its entire interior side. This coating comprises a thermally sealable synthetic material and serves to create an air-tight pack 11, on one hand, and to connect the webs 19, 20 by means of thermal sealing. The connecting layer 39 is arranged on the continuous coating 42 in the region of the cover tab 16, for example by being imprinted on it.<br>
The pack 11 is also suited for accommodating a plurality of items, in particular a plurality of cigarettes 10. FIG. 24 to FIG. 26 show an embodiment in which two cigarettes 10 are arranged lying next to one another in the pack. The blank 12 for this pack corresponds to the blank pursuant to FIG. 13, but having a wider base wall 25 corresponding to the number of cigarettes 10. The other folding lines also correspond to the example provided in FIG. 13.<br>
The packs 11 or blanks 12 are manufactured from a continuous web 43 of the packaging material. The width of the web 43 corresponds to the length of one blank (FIG. 13, FIG. 15, FIG. 17). The blanks 12 are delimited from one another in the web 43 by transverse parting lines, in particular by transverse perforated lines 44. The material web 43 exhibits all embossments or creases for the formation of folding lines in accordance with a finished blank 12. Accordingly, the blanks 12 to be immediately processed can be severed from the web 43 and processed.<br>
However, the special feature also means that the packs 11 can be manufactured continually through deformation of the web 43, specifically while maintaining structural<br><br>
cohesion within the web 43. As a result, a continuous row or chain 45 of successively connected packs 11 are created. Depending on the requirement, packs 11 can be severed from this chain 45 either individually or as a plurality in the region of the perforation lines 44. An upper end piece 46 of the chain 45 is employed as a tab for fastening the chain to a retaining fixture, for example for hanging it on a hook 47 (FIG. 19, FIG. 20). The end piece 46, which is configured to be free of folding lines and perforations, essentially consists of two layers of the web 43 and has an aperture 48 for the hook 47.<br>
One special feature is the production of packs 11, or of chains comprising a plurality of packs 11, from a the continuous web 43. The same procedure used in the folding steps for the cover tabs 15, 16 shown in FIG. 7 to FIG. 10 in the case of a single blank 12 is applied to the continuous web 43. The latter has marginal web strips which form the succession of cover tabs 15, on one hand, and cover tabs 16, on the other. The web strips involved are folded over along continuous folding lines. The folding lines are defined in the region of the webs 19, 20 by the succession of folding lines for the transverse walls 33, 34 and for the folding lines 21 and 24 which close on one another. During the folding procedure the transverse walls 33, 34 are automatically erected in a continuous manner.<br>
The web 43 has unprocessed sections located between groups of blanks 12, namely web sections 49. Applied in their region are merely pre-punchings for the subsequent formation of the apertures 48. Furthermore, longitudinal folding lines 50, 51 are embossed in the region of the web section 49 in the longitudinal direction of the web 43. The longitudinal folding lines 50, 51 are a continuation of the folding lines for the transverse walls 33, 34 and facilitate the folding over of marginal strips of the web 43 in the region of the web sections 49. The legs thus formed are covered and thermally sealed to one another, preferably across their full surface, so that the resulting end pieces 46 assume an essentially double-layered configuration.<br>
The production process schematically shown in FIG. 5 to FIG. 10 for a single blank 12 is conducted such that folding lines 21 ...24, 35 and the folding lines for the transverse walls 33, 34 are first applied in the region of the web 43. The cavities 17, 18 are formed before or after the application of the perforated lines 44. Then the cigarettes 10 are inserted from above in the middle region of a blank 12, namely in the region of the partial pack 13, into the corresponding cavity 17. Afterwards, the strip of the web 43 forming the cover tabs 15 is first folded over to form the associated transverse walls 33 (FIG. 7, FIG. 8). After a slight time delay, the strip of the material web 43 for forming the cover tabs 16 is folded against<br><br>
the upper side of the lower partial pack 13 (FIG. 8, FIG. 9). As a result of the time delay, the overlap 38 is created with the cover tab 16 lying on the outside. The result is a chain 45 consisting of a plurality of packs 11. The unit is severed from the web 43 along a transverse punched line 52, thus resulting in a respective (sales) unit consisting of a plurality of packs 11 and an end piece 46.<br>
One special feature is that chains 45 having end pieces 46 of different lengths or with different positions of the aperture 48 can be produced on the basis of correspondingly sized sections in the region of the web 43. This makes it possible to arrange chains 45 having an offset arrangement of the packs 11 of adjacent chains 45 next to each other on a hook 47 (FIG. 19). The packs 11 of one chain 45 enter into the gaps between the packs 11 of the adjacent chain 45. The dimensions are selected pursuant to FIG. 19 such that the width of a pack 11 with base wall 25 and side walls 26. 27 corresponds to the sum of the width of the two webs 19, 20. The dimension 53 of the end piece 46 shown in FIG. 19 is expediently an integer multiple of the dimension 54, i.e. of the total width of a pack 11.<br><br>

purpose of forming transverse walls (33, 34) of each pack (11),<br>
d)	the web strips formed by the folding lines that run in the longitudinal direction of the<br>
web are folded over in a continuous process such that partial packs (13, 14), in<br>
particular cover tabs (15, 16) for the formation of a partial pack (14), are continuously<br>
folded onto a different region of the web (43) to form successive packs (11) consisting<br>
of two partial packs (13,14).<br>
14.	The method according to Claim 13, characterized in that, in the region of an<br>
unprocessed web section (49), web strips delimited by longitudinal folding lines (50, 51)<br>
are folded onto one another to form an end piece (46) of a chain (45).<br>
15.	The method according to Claim 13 or 14, characterized in that units or chains of<br>
packs (11) and a respective end piece (46) are severed from the continuous web in the<br>
