PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in<br>
which it is to be performed.<br>
 <br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a vehicle control system in general, and more particularly, this relates to vehicle auto stop-start control system for manual transmission vehicles and method of controlling auto stop-start system thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
In high traffic city areas, a significant time of commute is spent at traffic signals and other stops. During all that time, the vehicle is stopped, and the engine is idling, thereby wasting substantial amount of fuel, and also increasing pollution. Such wasted fuel could be conserved and consequent air pollution eliminated if there is an automatic way of stopping the engine while the vehicle is stopped, and then starting the engine by capturing the driver's intention to move the vehicle. Although it is possible to implement this logic in any vehicle which has an electric starting system and an electronic fuel injection control, due to various problems like life, durability, and noise of the conventional engine starting systems based on starter motors, permanently engaged starting systems are being used to implement auto stop feature. Such permanently engaged starting mechanisms are generally integrated into the generator resulting in Integrated Starter Generator (ISG) systems; however, the savings would accrue even for vehicle with any starting system which can be controlled electrically, and with a fuel supply which can be electrically cut off. Integrated Starter Generator systems are either connected in-line with the engine between the flywheel and transmission, or connected via belt-drive system similar to the conventional vehicle alternator. Several control strategies have been proposed and some have been commercialized for Auto Stop-Start feature ISG systems in automatic transmission vehicles. For manual transmission vehicles, the use of manual clutch by the driver complicates the control strategies in determining the driver's intention to stop the vehicle and start the vehicle. Current ISG systems for Manual Transmission vehicles require the driver to put the vehicle in neutral after the vehicle comes to a stop in order to stop the engine.   However, several drivers, especially in India, are<br>
 <br>
 <br>
habituated to keeping the vehicle in gear at stops while pressing the clutch pedal to disengage the running engine. For such drivers, the auto stop feature would require a change in the driving habit to realize its fuel-saving potential. Also, drivers commonly use half-clutch to hold the vehicle on an incline, wherein an inadvertent auto-stop could be potentially dangerous. Another control scheme for manual transmission vehicles switches off the engine as the vehicle speed falls below a threshold. This could potentially result in loss of braking performance, if the vehicle continues to crawl for some more distance, and if this occurs at a down-incline, depending on the traffic situation.<br>
US 6,987,330 describes a vehicle AutoStop-Start system which senses the brake pedal actuation, the wheel indicator to determine if the wheels are not connected to and turned by the engine, and the vehicle speed signal, and stops the engine if the brake pedal is pressed, and the vehicle speed is below a threshold speed, and the engine is disengaged. The vehicle is again started once the brake pedal is released and if the engine is disengaged. The drawback associated with this method is that this control system works only for auto transmission system where the driver has no control on whether the engine is connected to the wheels or not (except in explicit Neutral driving mode). Also, in this system, the engine is switched off at a finite vehicle speed. Another drawback of this method is that in heavy and chaotic traffic situations common in developing countries, there are situations where the vehicle is made to crawl at a very low speed, and also frequent intermittent stops which can actually worsen the fuel economy since the engine uses a little extra fuel while starting. Too frequent starts can actually increase the net fuel consumption.<br>
In conventional AutoStop-Start control systems for manual transmission vehicles, the engine is switched off when the driver engages the neutral gear and releases the clutch pedal. However, many drivers, especially in third world countries, would like to keep the vehicle stationary while the transmission is in gear, and the clutch and brake pedals are pressed simultaneously.   The drawback associated with these systems is<br>
 <br>
 <br>
that in such situations, the engine will not be turned off, and the driver would get no benefit of the AutoStop-Start feature.<br>
OBJECT OF INVENTION<br>
The main object of this invention is to provide an improved vehicle AutoStop-Start control system for manual transmission vehicles which provides the fuel economy benefits of AutoStop-Start feature with minimal change in driver behaviour.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide an improved method for controlling the AutoStop-Start system for manual transmission vehicles in which, an auto stop is prevented from occurring if the engine speed is above idle speed.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide an improved method for controlling the AutoStop-Start system for manual transmission vehicles in which an inadvertent starting of the engine is prevented when the driver first starts the vehicle.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide a simple and cost effective vehicle AutoStop-Start control system for manual transmission vehicles and the method of controlling the AutoStop-Start system.<br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION<br>
Improved vehicle AutoStop-Start control system for manual transmission vehicles comprises of an electronic controller and an Engine Starting/Stopping system which can start or stop the engine in response to electronic commands, said electronic controller further comprises of digital and analog input blocks, a memory block, and one or more semiconductor devices for mathematical and logical computation, plurality of digital sensors are interfaced with said digital inputs block, plurality of analog sensors are interfaced with said analog inputs block, said electronic controller is further interfaced with the Engine Starting/Stopping system.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
Improved vehicle AutoStop-Start control system for manual transmission vehicles basically comprises of an electronic controller and an Engine Starting/Stopping system which can start or stop the engine in response to electronic commands. Said electronic controller further comprises of digital and analog input blocks, a memory block, and one or more semiconductor devices for mathematical and logical computation. Various digital sensors like vehicle speed sensor, engine speed sensor, etc. are interfaced with the digital inputs block of said electronic controller. Analog sensors like battery voltage sensor, coolant temperature sensor, etc. are interfaced with the analog inputs block of said electronic controller. The electronic controller is further interfaced with the Engine Starting/Stopping system.<br>
The digital and analog information obtained by the electronic controller through the digital and analog inputs blocks respectively are first stored in the memory block. Using this stored information from the memory block, the semiconductor device does the necessary logical and mathematical computation and accordingly generates the signals for starting or stopping the engine. The Engine Starting/Stopping system starts or stops the engine in response to said signals.<br>
After vehicle comes to a complete stand-still, the electronic controller checks if the engine is running; if so, the controller checks if the engine speed is at idle speed. If the engine is at idle speed, the controller further checks if<br>
(a)	The clutch pedal is released, implying that the vehicle is in neutral, or<br>
(b)	Both the clutch pedal and brake pedal are pressed simultaneously.<br>
If either said conditions (a) or (b) is satisfied, the controller gives command to the Engine Starting/Stopping System to turn off the engine after a prescribed time provided all conditions for safe turn off of engine are satisfied. When the controller senses that the clutch pedal is depressed from a released state, it gives a command to the Engine Starting/Stopping System to re-start the engine.   This kind of starting is<br>
 <br>
 <br>
disabled when the driver first starts the engine - i.e., the ignition key is turned from KEY ON to IGNITION position. In such cases, the driver has to necessarily turn the key to CRANK position to start the engine. The driver can also disable the entire AutoStop-Start system using an override switch. The vehicle could then be driven like a regular vehicle.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
Referring now to the drawings wherein the showings are for the purpose of illustrating a preferred embodiment of the invention only, and not for the purpose of limiting the same<br>
Referring to figs. 1 and 2,<br>
Vehicle AutoStop-Start control system for manual transmission vehicles comprises of<br>
an electronic controller (1) and an Engine Starting/Stopping system (16) which can<br>
start or stop the engine in response to electronic commands. Said electronic controller<br>
(1) comprises of<br>
Digital inputs block (2) comprising of devices and components for sensing plurality of<br>
digital signals like<br>
vehicle speed signal (8)<br>
engine speed signal (9),<br>
a digital signal representing the status of the clutch pedal (10), whether it is pressed or<br>
not<br>
a digital signal representative of the brake pedal (11), whether it is pressed or not<br>
a digital signal indicating that the ignition key is in the "IGNITION" position (12)<br>
 <br>
 <br>
a digital signal indicating that the ignition key is in the "CRANK" position (13).<br>
Analog inputs block (7) comprising of devices and components for sensing plurality<br>
of analog signals like<br>
Battery voltage signal (14)<br>
Coolant temperature signal (15)<br>
Memory block (6) for storing the information contained in the said signals<br>
Semiconductor device (3) for mathematical and logical computation.<br>
The information contained in the said analog and digital signals are stored periodically<br>
in the memory block (6), and processed by the semiconductor device (3) for<br>
mathematical and logical computation as per the control logic.<br>
Various digital sensors like vehicle speed sensor, engine speed sensor, clutch pedal<br>
sensor, brake pedal sensor, ignition and crank key positions are interfaced with the<br>
digital inputs block of the electronic controller through respective digital signals<br>
(8,9,10,11,12,13).   Analog sensors like battery voltage sensor, coolant temperature<br>
sensor, etc. are also interfaced with the analog inputs block of the electronic controller<br>
through respective analog signals (14, 15).   Said electronic controller (1) is further<br>
interfaced with the Engine Starting/Stopping system (16).<br>
The digital and analog information obtained by the electronic controller through the<br>
digital and analog inputs blocks respectively are first stored in the memory block.<br>
Using this stored information from the memory block, the semiconductor device does<br>
the necessary logical and mathematical computation and accordingly generates the<br>
signals (4,5) for starting or stopping the engine. The Engine Starting/Stopping system<br>
starts or stops the engine in response to said signals.<br>
Method  for controlling AutoStop-Start  system,  which resides  in the  electronic<br>
controller, is described in Fig. 2. The controlling method is outlined in the following<br>
steps:<br>
Running vehicle , at a speed above a threshold speed (currently set at a value within 6<br>
- 25 kmph, preferably at 6 kmph),<br>
Bringing the vehicle to a complete stand-still<br>
Sensing if the vehicle speed has reached zero<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Checking if the engine is running, and if so, if it is at idle speed<br>
If the engine is running at idle speed, then check if<br>
the clutch pedal is released, implying that the vehicle is in neutral, or<br>
both the clutch pedal and brake pedal are pressed simultaneously,<br>
If conditions (a) or (b) is satisfied, then checking if the conditions for safe turn off of<br>
the engine are existing (battery state-of-charge is adequately high for starting the<br>
engine again, coolant temperature is above a threshold to prevent excessive cold<br>
emissions, etc.)<br>
If all conditions are satisfied, then wait for a prescribed time (currently set at 4<br>
seconds, but can be tuned to suit the typical drive cycle of the vehicle) and give<br>
command (5) to the Engine Starting/Stopping System to switch off the engine.   This<br>
operation is hereinafter called "AutoStop".<br>
Waiting for the driver to press the clutch pedal again.<br>
Once the driver presses the clutch pedal from a previously released position, give a<br>
command signal (4) to the Engine Starting/Stopping System to start the engine.  This<br>
operation is hereinafter called "Clutch Start".<br>
Disabling the AutoStop operation till the vehicle reaches a threshold speed (currently<br>
set at a value within 6-25 kmph, preferably at 6 kmph).<br>
In case when the driver initially enters the vehicle, inserts the ignition key, and rotates the key to IGNITION position, the controller disables clutch start. At this point, if the driver presses the clutch pedal, the controller will not give command to start the engine. Only if the driver rotates the ignition key to "CRANK" position will the controller give command signal (4) to the Engine Starting/Stopping System to start the engine.<br>
The driver can disable the entire AutoStop-Start system using an override switch. The vehicle could then be driven like a regular vehicle.<br>
The foregoing description is a specific embodiment of the present invention. It should be appreciated that this embodiment is described for purpose of illustration only, and<br>
 <br>
 <br>
that those skilled in the art may practice numerous alterations and modifications without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. It is intended that all such modifications and alterations be included insofar as they come within the scope of the invention as claimed or the equivalents thereof.<br>
