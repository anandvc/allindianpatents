				<td>APPLICATION DATA This application claims benefit to US provisional application No. 60/386,312 filed June 6, 2002 and US provisional application No. 60/457,867, filed March 26, 2003 and are hereby claimed and said applications are herein incorporated by reference.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to substituted 3-amino-thieno[2,3-b]pyridine-2-carboxylic acid amide compounds useful as inhibitors of the kinase activity of the IΚB kinase (IKK) complex. The compounds are therefore useful in the treatment of IKK-mediated diseases including autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases and cancer. The invention also relates to processes for preparing such compounds and pharmaceutical compositions comprising them.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION NF-KB or nuclear factor KB is a transcription factor that induces the expression of a large number of pro-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic genes. These include cytokines such as IL-1, IL-2, TNF-αand IL-6, chemokines including IL-8 and RANTES, as well as other pro-inflammatory molecules including COX-2 and cell adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin. The NF-κB family includes homo- and heterodimeric transcription factors composed of members of the Rel family (see for example P. A. Baeurle and D. Baltimore, Cell, 1996, 87, 13). Under resting conditions, NF-ΚB is present in the cytosol of cells as a complex with IΚB. The IΚB family of proteins serve as inhibitors of NF-ΚB, interfering with the function of its nuclear localization signal (see for example U. Siebenlist et al., Ann. Rev. Cell Biol, 1994,10,405). Upon disruption of the IΚB- NF-ΚB complex following cell activation, NF-ΚB translocates to the nucleus and activates gene transcription. Disruption of the IΚB- NF-ΚB complex and subsequent activation of NF-ΚB is initiated by degradation of IΚB .<br><br>
Upon cellular activation by a variety of pro-inflammatory stimuli including IL-1, TNF-ct and LPS (bacterial lipopolysaccharide), two specific serine residues of MB are phosphorylated. Upon phosphorylation, IicB undergoes polyubiquination and subsequent degradation by the 26S proteasome (see for example VJ. Palombella et al., Cell, 1994, 78, 773), freeing NF-KB to translocate to the nucleus. The phosphorylation of IicB is carried out by the IicB kinases (see for example a review by M. Karin and M. Delhase, Seminars in Immunology, 2000,12, 85). The traditional IKK complex includes at least three subunits, IKKa (also called IKK-1), IKKp (or IKK-2) and KKy (or NEMO), although other relevant complexes involving IKKa and IKKP may exist. IKKa and EKKP are both catalytic subunits while IKKy is believed to be a regulatory subunit. Both IKKa and IKKP can phosphorylate IicB. For the purposes of this document, the terms IKK or IKK complex refers to any complex that has kinase activity derived from IKKa and/or IKKP subunits.<br>
In vivo, activation of IKK occurs upon phosphorylation of its catalytic subunit. Both IKKa and IKKP can be phosphorylated on serine residues, SI 77 and SI 81 of the activation loop in the case of IKKp, and SI 76 and SI 80 of the activation loop for IKKa. An IKKp mutant having alanines in place of serines at 177 and 181 prevented IKKP phosphorylation and subsequent activation of the IKK complex by TNFa, IL-1 and other upstream activators. These results support a key role for IKKP in phosphorylation of MB following promflammatory stimulation.<br>
Studies in which the NF-KB pathway has been inhibited in cells and animals support the concept that inhibition of the phosphorylation of IicB is a viable approach to treatment of inflammatory, autoimmune and other diseases. In these studies, NF-icB activation was prevented by expression of a non-degradable version of the IicB protein. Expression of this inhibitor in synovial cells derived from rheumatoid arthritis patients reduced the expression of TNF-a, IL-6, IL-1 P and IL-8 while the anti-inflammatory molecules IL-10, IL-lra and IL-11 were not affected. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP1 and MMP3) were also down-regulated (J. Bonderson et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 1999, 96, 5668). Transgenic expression of the IicB inhibitor in T cells caused a significant reduction in the severity and onset of collagen-induced arthritis in mice (R. Seetharaman et al., J. Immunol.<br>
1999,163, 1577). These experiments indicate that suppression of NF-KB in the diseased joint could reduce both the severity and progression of RA. In primary intestinal epithelial :ells, the NF-KB inhibitor blocked the expression of IL-1, IL-8, iNOS and COX-2, mediators that are up-regulated during the course of inflammatory bowel disease (C. Jubin et al., J. Immunol., 1998,160, 410). Expression of this inhibitor in certain tumor cells enhances killing of these cells by chemotherapeutic reagents (A. A. Beg and D. Baltimore, Science, 1996,274,782).<br>
Analysis of biopsies from lungs of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) found an increased expression of NF-KB that correlated with disease severity (A. Di Stefano et al., Eur. Resp. J., 2002,1,437). Inhibition of NF-KB activation with inhibitors of IKK-P was among the anti-inflammatory approaches reported to be potentially useful in the treatment of COPD (P.J. Barnes, Nature Rev. Drug Disc., 2002,1, 437). Likewise, inhibition of NF-KB activity has been mentioned as a therapeutic approach for asthma (A. Pahl and I. Szelenyi, Infl. Res., 2002, 57, 273).<br>
A recent review describes the essential role of inflammatory mediators in the development cardiovascular disease. The inflammatory mediators and the cells that they recruit are reported to play a key role in the development of fatty streaks and plaques that lead to atherosclerosis. In addition they are reported to play a key role in subsequent degradation of the fibrous cap that forms over the plaque, leading to rupture and clot formation. If the clot grows large enough it can lead to myocardial infarction or stroke.  Thus, anti-inflammatory drugs that can inhibit the production of these mediators and subsequent, recruitment and activation of these cells may be beneficial in treatment of these diseases (P. Libby, Scientific American, 2002,46).<br>
A number of studies indicate that activation of NF-KB also plays a key role in the pathogenesis and development of cancer (see for example reviews by B. Haefner, Drug Disc. Today,20Q2, 7, 653 and M. Karin et al, Nat. Rev. Cancer, 2002, 2, 301). Studies have shown that cells in which NF-KB is constitutively active are resistant to apoptosis. This can contribute to carcinogenesis by preventing cell death in cells that have undergone chromosomal changes or damage. In addition tumor cells with constitutively active NF-<br>
KB are resistant to anti-cancer therapies including chemotherapy and radiation. Further studies have linked activated NF-KB to a variety of lymphoid-, myeloid- and epithelial-derived malignancies including leukemia, lymphomas and breast, gastric, colorectal, lung, and pancreatic cancers. Thus it is suggested that inhibitors of NF-KB, including inhibitors of IKKa and IKKp, may be useful either alone or in combination with other anti-cancer therapies in treating cancer.<br>
Collectively, the studies described above provide support that inhibition of NF-KB function through inhibition of IKK may be a useful therapeutic approach to treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory disease, cardiovascular disease and cancer.<br>
Studies have also been done in mice with targeted disruption of the IKK|3 gene.  Knockout of the IKKp gene resulted in embryonic lethality due to apoptosis of hepatocytes. However, fibroblasts from the IKKp knockouts did not undergo IKK and NF-KB activation upon stimulation with IL-1 or TNFa (Q. Li et al., Science, 1999, 284, 321), supporting a key role for IKKp in and NF-KB activation following inflammatory stimuli.<br>
A conditional knockout was generated by expressing a liver-specific inducible dominant negative M8a transgene (I. Lavon et al., Nature Medicine, 2000, 6, 573). These mice were viable with no signs of liver dysfunction even after one year but they did have impaired immune function. This study supports the idea that inhibition of IKKp can result in immune suppression without damage to the liver.<br>
IKKa knock-out mice died shortly after birth and displayed a variety of skeletal defects and skin abnormalities. Fibroblast and thymocytes from these mice showed normal IKK activation and MB degradation in response to TNFa, IL-1 or LPS (Y. Hu et al., Science, 1999, 284, 316; K. Takeda etal., Science, 1999, 284, 313). Recent studies with knock-out and knock-in mice have revealed distinct roles for IKKa in development and cell signaling. In contrast to the studies with IKKa knock-out mice, mice having a kinase inactive version of IKKa knocked in are viable and fertile, indicating that the perinatal lethality and abnormalities seen in the IKKa knock-out mice are not due to the lack of<br>
kinase activity. However, these mice do have defects in B cell maturation and development of secondary lymphoid organs (U. Senftleben et al., Science, 2001, 293, 1495). This phenotype appears to be due to a defect in processing of the NF-KB2/plOO protein to p52, the DNA binding form of this member of the Rel family of transcription factors. In turn, this leads to a defect in the activation of a subset of NF-icB target genes in B cells. In addition, other studies with these same mice have shown that IKKa kinase activity is required for NF-KB activation in the mammary epithelium during pregnancy (Cao, Y., et. al., Cell, 2001,107,763). This pathway is specifically activated through the TNF receptor family member RANK, requires phosphorylation of the canonical IKK substrate IicBa, and culminates in induction of the cell cycle regulatory gene Cyclin Dl.<br>
These studies indicate that an inhibitor of IKKa kinase activity may be useful in treating diseases associated with inappropriate B cell activation such as lupus (O.T. Chan et al., Immunological Rev., 1999,169, 107) and rheumatoid arthritis (A. Cause and C. Borek, Biodrugs, 2001,15, 73). In addition, an inhibitor of IKKa may be useful in the treatment of breast cancer since NF-KB is constitutively active in a number of breast rumors and many of these tumors depend on Cyclin Dl for proliferation.<br>
Some inhibitors of DCKP have been reported. WO 01/58890 and WO 03/037886 describes heteoaromatic carboxamide derivatives as inhibitors of IKKp. WO 01/68648 describes substituted p-carbolines having IKKP inhibiting activity. Substituted indoles having IKKP inhibitory activity are reported in WO 01/30774. WO 01/00610 describes substituted benzimidazoles having NF-KB inhibitory activity. Aspirin and salicylate have been reported to bind to and inhibit IKKp (M. Yin et al., Nature, 1998, 396, 77).<br>
Substituted thienopyridines having cell adhesion inhibiting activity are reported in US 2001/0020030 Al and A.O. Stewart et al., J. Med. Chem., 2001, 44, 988. Thienopyridines exhibiting gonadotropin releasing hormone antagonizing activity are reported in US 6,313,301. Substituted thienopyridines described as telomerase inhibitors are disclosed in U.S. 5,656,638.<br>

and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, tautomers, individual isomers, and mixtures of isomers thereof.<br>
The invention includes pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives of compounds of formula (I).   A "pharmaceutically acceptable derivative" refers to any pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
acid, salt or ester of a compound of this invention, or any other compound which, upon administration to a patient, is capable of providing (directly or indirectly) a compound of this invention, a pharmacologically active metabolite or pharmacologically active residue thereof.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of this invention include those derived from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic and organic acids and bases.

Terms not specifically defined herein should be given the meanings that would be given to them by one of skill in the art in light of the disclosure and the context. For example, "C\. ealkoxy" is a Chalky! with a terminal oxygen, such as methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, pentoxy and hexoxy. All alkyl, alkylene or alkynyl groups shall be understood as being branched, unbranched unless otherwise specified. Other more specific definitions are as follows:<br>
The term "alkyl" refers to a saturated aliphatic radical containing from one to ten carbon atoms or a mono- or polyunsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon radical containing from two to twelve carbon atoms unless otherwise stated. The mono- or polyunsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon radical contains at least one double or triple bond, respectively. "Alkyl" refers to both branched and unbranched alkyl groups. Examples of "alkyl" include alkyl groups which are straight chain alkyl groups containing from one to eight carbon atoms and branched alkyl groups containing from three to ten carbon atoms. Other examples include<br>
lower alkyl groups which are straight chain alkyl groups containing from one to six carbon atoms and branched alkyl groups containing from three to six carbon atoms. It should be understood that any combination term using an "alk" or "alkyl" prefix refers to analogs according to the above definition of "alkyl". For example, terms such as "alkoxy", "alkythio" refer to alkyl groups linked to a second group via an oxygen or sulfur atom. "Alkanoyl" refers to an alkyl group linked to a carbonyl group (C=O). Each alkyl or alkyl analog described herein shall be understood to be optionally partially or folly halogenated.<br>
The term "cycloalkyl" refers to the cyclic analog of an alkyl group, as defined above. Examples of cycloalkyl groups are saturated or unsaturated nonaromatic cycloalkyl groups containing from three to eight carbon atoms, and other examples include cycloalkyl groups having three to six carbon atoms.<br>
The term "heterocycloalkyl" refers to a stable 4-8 membered (but preferably, 5 or 6 membered) monocyclic or 8-11 membered bicyclic heterocycle radical which may be either saturated or unsaturated, and is non-aromatic.   Each heterocycle consists of carbon atoms and from 1 to 4 heteroatoms chosen from nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur. The heterocycle may be attached by any atom of the cycle, which results in the creation of a stable structure. Examples of "heterocycloalkyl" include radicals such as pyrrolinyl, pyrrolidinyl, pyrazolinyl, pyrazolidinyl, piperidinyl, morpholinyl, thiomorpholinyl, piperazinyl, indolinyl, azetidinyl, tetrahydropyranyl, tetrahydrothiopyranyl, tetrahydrofuranyl, hexahydropyrimidinyl, hexahydropyridazmyl, dihydro-oxazolyl, 1,2-thiazinanyl-1,1-dioxide, 1,2,6-thiadiazinanyl-1,1 -dioxide, isothiazolidinyl-1,1-dioxide and imidazolidinyl-2,4-dione.<br>
The term "halogen" refers to bromine, chlorine, fluorine or iodine.<br>
The term "aryl" shall be understood to mean a 6-12 membered aromatic carbocycle, which can be a single ring or can be multiple rings fused together or linked covalently. The term "aryl" includes, for example, phenyl and naphthyl; other terms comprising "aryl" will have the same definition for the aryl component, examples of these moieties include: arylalkyl, aryloxy or arylthio.<br>
The term "heteroaryl" refers to a stable 5-8 membered (but preferably, 5 or 6 membered) monocyclic or 8-11 membered bicyclic aromatic heterocycle radical. Each heterocycle consists of carbon atoms and from 1 to 4 heteroatoms chosen from nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur. The heteroaryl group may be attached by any atom of the ring which results in the creation of a stable structure. Examples of "heteroaryl" include radicals such as furanyl, thienyl, pyrrolyl, oxazolyl, thiazolyl, imidazolyl, pyrazolyl, isoxazolyl, isothiazolyl, oxadiazolyl, triazolyl, tetrazolyl, thiadiazolyl, pyridinyl, pyridazinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyrazinyl, indolizinyl, indolyl, isoindolyl, benzofuranyl, benzothienyl, indazolyl, benzimidazolyl, benzthiazolyl, benzoxazolyl, purinyl, quinolizinyl, quinolinyl, isoquinolinyl, cinnolinyl, phthalazinyl, quinazolinyl, quinoxalinyl, naphthyridinyl, pteridinyl, carbazolyl, acridinyl, phenazinyl, phenothiazinyl and phenoxazinyl.<br>
The terms "optional" or "optionally" mean that the subsequently described event or circumstances may or may not occur, and that the description includes instances where the event or circumstance occurs and instances in which it does not. For example, "optionally substituted aryl" means that the aryl radical may or may not be substituted and that the description includes both substituted aryl radicals and aryl radicals having no substitution.<br>
The term "substituted" means that any one or more hydrogens on an atom of a group or moiety, whether specifically designated or not, is replaced with a selection from the indicated group of substituents, provided that the atom's normal valency is not exceeded and that the substitution results in a stable compound. If a bond to a substituent is shown to cross the bond connecting two atoms in a ring, then such substituent may be bonded to any atom on the ring. When a substituent is listed without indicating the atom via which such substituent is bonded to the rest of the compound, then such substituent may be bonded via any atom in such substituent. For example, when the substituent is piperazinyl, piperidinyl, or tetrazolyl, unless specified otherwise, such piperazinyl, piperidinyl, or tetrazolyl group may be bonded to the rest of the compound of the invention via any atom in such piperazinyl, piperidinyl, or tetrazolyl group. Generally, when any substituent or group occurs more than one time in any constituent or compound, its definition on each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other occurrence. Thus, for example, if<br>
a group is shown to be substituted with 0 to 2 R, then such group is optionally substituted with up to two R groups and R at each occurrence is selected independently from the defined list of possible R. Such combinations of substituents and/or variables, however, are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds.<br>
As used herein above and throughout this application, "nitrogen" and "sulfur" include any oxidized form of nitrogen and sulfur and the quaternized form of any basic nitrogen.<br>
Methods of Therapeutic Use<br>
In accordance with the invention, there are provided novel methods of using the compounds of the formula (I). The compounds of the invention are effective in inhibiting the activity of IKKp and/or IKKa. In particular, these compounds are useful in blocking disease processes exacerbated by KK|3-mediated NF-KB activation and IKKa activation of B cell activity or the cell cycle regulatory gene Cyclin Dl. In blocking NF-KB activation, compounds of the invention effectively block transcription of genes encoding inflammatory cytokines including IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, TNFcc, chemokines including IL-8 and RANTES as well as other pro-inflammatory molecules including COX-2 and cell adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and E-selectin. These mediators play a key role in the etiology of inflammatory, autoimmune and cardiovascular disorders and cancer. Preventing the production of these mediators is a desirable means for treating these disorders. Thus there are provided methods for treating these conditions using the compounds of the invention.   Such inflammatory and autoimmune conditions include but are not limited to osteoarthritis, reperfusion injury, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, graft versus host disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, toxic shock syndrome, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitis, acute and chronic pain, thermal injury, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ injury secondary to trauma, acute glomerulonephritis, dermatoses with acute inflammatory components, acute purulent meningitis or other central nervous system disorders, Grave's disease, myasthenia gravis, scleroderma and atopic dermatitis. Such<br>
cardiovascular disorders include but are not limited to atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction and stroke. Such cancers include but are not limited to lymphoid-, myeloid- and epithelial-derived malignancies including leukemia, lymphomas and breast, gastric, colorectal, lung, and pancreatic cancers. The compounds of the invention can also be used to treat other disorders associated with IKK activation of NF-KB unrelated to those listed above or discussed in the Background of the Invention. For example, the compounds of the invention may also be useful in the treatment of cancer by enhancing the effectiveness of chemotherapeutic agents. Therefore, the invention also provides methods of treating inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, and other diseases including cancer, comprising administering to a patient in need of such treatment a pharmaceutically effect amount of a compound according to the invention.<br>
For therapeutic use, the compounds of the invention may be administered in any conventional dosage form in any conventional manner. Routes of administration include, but are not limited to, intravenously, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intrasynovially, by infusion, sublingually, transdermally, orally, topically or by inhalation. The preferred modes of administration are oral and intravenous. Compositions comprising the compounds of the invention for each of the aforementioned routes of administration will be apparent to the skilled artisan. The invention also provides for pharmaceutical compositions including a therapeutically effective amount of the compounds according to the invention. Such pharmaceutical compositions will include pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and adjuvants as further described below.<br>
The compounds of this invention may be administered alone or in combination with adjuvants that enhance stability of the inhibitors, facilitate administration of pharmaceutical compositions containing them in certain embodiments, provide increased dissolution or dispersion, increase inhibitory activity, provide adjunct therapy, and the like, including other active ingredients. Advantageously, such combination therapies utilize lower dosages of the conventional therapeutics, thus avoiding possible toxicity and adverse side effects incurred when those agents are used as monotherapies. Compounds of the invention may be physically combined with the conventional therapeutics or other<br>
adjuvants into a single pharmaceutical composition. Advantageously, the compounds may then be administered together in a single dosage form. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions comprising such combinations of compounds contain at least about 15%, but more preferably at least about 20%, of a compound of the invention (w/w) or a combination thereof. Alternatively, the compounds may be administered separately (either serially or in parallel). Separate dosing allows for greater flexibility in the dosing regime.<br>
As mentioned above, dosage forms of the compounds of this invention include pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and adjuvants known to those of ordinary skill in the art. These carriers and adjuvants include, for example, ion exchangers, alumina, aluminum stearate, lecithin, serum proteins, buffer substances, water, salts or electrolytes and cellulose-based substances. Preferred dosage forms include, tablet, capsule, caplet, liquid, solution, suspension, emulsion, lozenges, syrup, reconstitutable powder, granule, suppository and transdermal patch. Methods for preparing such dosage forms are known (see, for example, H.C. Ansel and N.G. Popovish, Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, 5th ed., Lea and Febiger (1990)). Dosage levels and requirements are well-recognized in the art and may be selected by those of ordinary skill in the art from available methods and techniques suitable for a particular patient. In some embodiments, dosage levels range from about 10-1000 mg/dose for a 70 kg patient. Although one dose per day may be sufficient, up to 5 doses per day may be given. For oral doses, up to 2000 mg/day may be required. As the skilled artisan will appreciate, lower or higher doses may be required depending on particular factors. For instance, specific dosage and treatment regimens will depend on factors such as the patient's general health profile, the severity and course of the patient's disorder or disposition thereto, and the judgment of the treating physician.<br>
SYNTHETIC METHODS<br>
The invention additionally provides for methods for making the compounds of the<br>
formula (I). The compounds of the invention may be prepared by the general methods and examples presented below, and methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Optimum reaction conditions and reaction times may vary depending on the particular reactants used. Unless otherwise specified, solvents, temperatures, pressures, and other reaction conditions may be readily selected by one of ordinary skill in the art. Specific procedures are provided in the Synthetic Examples section. Reaction progress may be monitored by conventional methods such as thin layer chromatography (TLC). Intermediates and products may be purified by methods known in the art, including column chromatography, HPLC or recrystallization.<br>
As illustrated in Scheme I, compounds of formula (I) may be prepared starting with a 1,3-dione bearing substituents ri and Ra (II). Reaction of II with cyanothioacetamide (HI) in a suitable solvent such as EtOH, in the presence of a suitable base such as triethylamine provides the substituted 2-mercaptonicotinonitrile IV. Reaction of IV with chloro- or bromoacetamide (V), in a suitable solvent such as DMF, THF or EtOH, in the presence of a suitable base such as sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide or sodium ethoxide, provides the desired compound of formula (I). Substituents ri and ri may be further modified by methods known in the art to produce additional compounds of the invention.<br>

For example, as illustrated in Scheme II, beginning with a diketo ester VI and using the procedure outlined above, one obtains ester I (Rj = CC^R', where R' is an alkyl group such as methyl or ethyl). By using methods known in the art, ri may be modified to make other desired ri . For example, hydrolysis provides the carboxylic acid I (Ri = COiH) and reaction of the carboxylic acid with an amine R"NH2 under standard coupling conditions provides the amide I (Ri = C(O)NHR"). Alternatively, reduction of the ester with a suitable reducing agent such as lithiun aluminum hydride provides an alcohol I (Ri = CI^OH). Reaction of the alcohol with a phenol ArOH under Mitsunobu conditions provides the aryl ether I (Ri = CHaOAr). These and other modifications are described in the Synthetic Examples section.<br>

In a modification of the above procedure for preparing VTI, one may begin with a 2-chloro or 2-bromo-3-cyano-isonicotinic acid ester (VEI, Scheme HI). The 2-halo group may then be converted to a 2-mercapto group by methods known in the art, for example by reaction with thiourea in a suitable solvent such as EtOH providing the ester intermediate VII.<br>
Scheme III<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
Scheme IV illustrates a procedure by which one may obtain compounds of formula (I) having an amine at ri. 2-Bromo-4-hydroxy-nicotinonitrile (IX) is treated with 4-methoxybenzyl chloride in the presence of a suitable base such as sodium hydride in a suitable solvent such as DMF to provide the 4-methoxybenzyl ether X. This may then be converted to the 2-mercapto compound as described above in Scheme m. The resulting mercapto compound may then be reacted with a haloacetamide as described in Schemes I and II to provide I (Ri = 4-methoxybenzyl ether). Alternatively, one may react X with mercaptoacetamide in the presence of a suitable base such as sodium hydride in a suitable solvent such as DMF to provide I (Ri = 4-methoxybenzyl ether) directly. Treatment of the ether with trifluoroacetic acid provides the salt XI. Reaction of XI with N-phenyltrifluoromernanesulfonimide in the presence of a suitable base such as diisopropylethylamine in a suitable solvent such as dioxane provides the trifluoromethanesulfonate XII. Reaction of XII with an amine R'R"NH in a suitable solvent such as dioxane provides I (Ri = NR'R")- The reaction may optionally be heated for less reactive amines such as aryl amines.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
A procedure that may be used to introduce a variety of aryl or arylalkenyl groups at ri and nucleophiles such as amines at ri is illustrated in Scheme V. Meldrum's acid (XIII) is treated with carbon disulfide, methyl iodide and a suitable base such as triethylamine, in a suitable solvent such as DMSO to provide the bis-methylsulfanylmethylene-dione XIV. Treatment of X3V with 2-cyanothioacetamide under suitable alkaline conditions such as sodium ethoxide in ethanol provides nitrile XVa. Reaction of XVa with 2-chloro or 2-bromoacetamide in the presence of a suitable base such as sodium hydride in a suitable solvent such as DMF provides XVIa. Cyclization to the triflate intermediate XVIIa may be achieved by reacting XVI with N-phenyltrifluoromethane-sulfonimide in the presence of a suitable base such as sodium hydride in a suitable solvent such as DMF. Reaction of XVIIa with the desired aryl boronic acid or arylalkenyl boronic acid in the presence of a suitable palladium catalyst, preferably tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0)-chloroform adduct, a phosphine ligand, preferably tri-2-furylphosphine and a copper salt, preferably copper(I)thiophene-2-carboxylate, in a suitable solvent such as THF, provides<br>
the desired aryl or arylalkenyl intermediate XVm. Reaction of XVin with the desired nucleophile such as an amine R'R"NH as shown, in a suitable solvent such as dioxane, provides the desired compound of formula (I). Alcohols (R'OH) or thiols (R'SH) in the presence of a suitable base could be used in place of an amine to obtain ethers or thioethers respectively at R2.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
A modification of the above procedure that will provide an alkyl group at ri is illustrated in Scheme VI. An alkynoate ester, such as the methyl ester shown, is reacted with 2-cyanothioacetamide in the presence of a suitable base such as morpholine in a suitable solvent such as ethanol to provide XVb. Treatment of XVb as described for conversion of XVa to XVIa in Scheme V above provides XVlb. Reaction of XVIb with a suitable sulfonating reagent such as N-phenyltrifluoromethane-sulfonimide in the presence of a suitable base such as diisopropylethylamine in a suitable solvent such as dioxane provides<br>
the sulfonyl ester XVnb (R* = CF3 in this case). Reaction of XVHb with the desired nucleophile, such as an amine in the presence of a suitable base such as triethylamine, optionally while heating at about 50 °C to 100 °C results in displacement of the sulfonyl ester by the nucleophile. Cyclization in situ may be achieved by adding a second suitable base such as aqueous sodium carbonate followed by continued heating to provide the desired compound of formula (I).<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
Another procedure that will provide aryl or arylalkenyl groups at ri and a variety of groups, such as aryl and alkyl, at Ra is illustrated in Scheme VII. As illustrated in Scheme VH, an acid chloride bearing Ra is reacted with vinylidene chloride in the presence of a Lewis acid such as AlCU, in a suitable solvent such as methylene chloride, followed by treatment with a suitable base such as triethylamine to provide XDC. Reaction of XDC with sodium thiomethoxide provides XX. Treatment of XX with 2-cyanothioacetamide in the presence of a suitable base such as sodium isopropoxide provides XXI. Reaction of XXI with 2-bromo or 2-chloroacetamide as described in Scheme I provides XXII. Treatment of XXn with an arylboronic acid or arylalkenylboronic acid as described in Scheme V provides the desired compound of formula (I).<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
An additional procedure that may be used to prepare compounds of formula (I) is illustrated in Scheme VII. An aldehyde bearing ri is reacted with a triphenylphosphoranylidene bearing Ra (XXm) in the presence of a suitable acid such as acetic acid, in a suitable solvent such as toluene, to provide the alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone XXTV. Treatment of XXIV with 2-cyanothioacetamide in the presence of a suitable base such as soduim f-butoxide provides IV. This is converted to I as described in Scheme I.<br>

The mixture was poured into saturated aqueous ammonium chloride, and extracted with EtOAc. The organic extract was washed with brine, dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated in vacua to afford 23.0 mg of the crude product. This was purified via automated flash silica chromatography (4 g silica gel column, 30-100% EtOAc/hexanes) to afford 9.0 mg (0.02 mmol, 45% yield) of the title compound.<br>

400 mg (1.04 mmol) of pyridine-triflate intermediate (see Example 1) was dissolved in 1,4-dioxane (10 mL), and placed in a dry pressure rube equipped with a magnetic stir bar and under Ar atmosphere. 4-N-Boc-aminopiperidine (640 mg, 3.13 mmol) was added, and the tube was sealed up. The reaction was stirred while heating at 80 °C for 35 min. TLC indicated the complete disappearance of starting triflate. The reaction was cooled to room temperature, and a 2.0 M aqueous solution of sodium carbonate (4.0 mL, 8.00 mmol) was added. The reaction was heated to 100 °C, where it stirred for 20 h, after which it was cooled to room temperature.<br>
The reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo, and the residue was taken up in acetone/MeOH (about 50:50). The resulting mixture was filtered and the filtrate was concentrated in vacuo. The material was pre-adsorbed onto diatomaceous earth and purified first via automated flash silica gel chromatography (10 g silica gel column, 30-70% EtOAc/hexanes gradient with EtOAc flush) to afford 274 mg of slightly crude product. This was further purified via regular flash chromatography on silica gel (30 mm diameter column by 4" height) eluting with 33%-50% EtOAc/hexanes step gradient, then an EtOAc flush, to afford 249.3 mg (55% yield) of [l-(3-Amino-2-carbamoyl-4-propyl-thieno[2,3-b]pyridin-6-yl)-piperidin-4-yl]-carbamic acid tert-butyl ester.<br>

ASSESSMENT OF BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES<br>
The inhibition of IKKa and IKKp by the compounds of the present invention was determined with the following assay that measures the phosphorylation of the MB a substrate by the respective kinases. The enzymes used in the assay were N-terminally flag-tagged versions of the human IKKp or IKKa and the substrate was a GST fusion protein with IicBa (amino acids 1-54).<br>
The reaction mixtures (60 pi) contained 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM MnCl2,100 mM NaCl, 100 uM Na3VO4, 20 mM B-glycerophosphate, 1 mM DTT, 2% DMSO, 250 nM ATP, 0.4 nM [33P]ATP (specific activity, 3000 Ci/mmol), MBa substrate, IKK enzyme and test compound. The reaction mixtures contained either 3.6 jag/ml IKKa and 245 ug/ml IicBa or 0.9 u.g/ml KK|3 and 53 ug/ml IicBa.<br>
Reactions were initiated by adding a solution of IicBa substrate and ATP to polypropylene plates containing IKK enzyme that was pre-incubated for 5 minutes with test compound. Then the reaction mixtures were incubated for 1 hour at 25°C, placed on ice and quenched by the addition of 150 ul 10% trichloroacetic acid and 5% disodium pyrophosphate. After mixing, the entire contents of the quenched reaction mixtures were transferred to a pre-wetted Packard UniFilter filtration plate, aspirated and washed 6 times with 250 \a\ of ddH^O using the Packard Filtermate Harvester. Filtration plates were then air dried, supplemented with 40 ul of Microscint 20 scintillation fluid and the 33P4abeled reaction products were quantified using the Packard TopCount scintillation counter.<br>
Compounds were tested in three-fold serial dilutions and inhibitor concentrations to achieve 50% inhibition of enzyme activity (i.e., ICso) were derived from dose-reponse curves using SAS software (SAS Institute, Gary NC). A non-linear regression analysis based on the Hill equation was applied to the percent inhibition versus concentration data. In all cases, compound concentrations were verified by HPLC.<br>
Compounds in the Tables in the Detailed Description of the Invention section were all evaluated in the assay for IKK|3 inhibition and had ICso's of 10 |jM or below. Compounds, listed below had ICjo's below 1 nM in this assay:<br>
