BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Cancer is a disease for which many potentially effective treatments are available.  However, due to the prevalence of cancers of various types and the serious effects it can have, more effective treatments, especially those with fewer adverse side effects than currently available forms of treatment, are needed..<br>
This invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions useful in treating cancer in a mammal.  The pharmaceutical compositions' of the present invention comprise two compounds:  a first compound which is paclitsxel, taxotere or a modified taxane cr taxoid analog arid a second compound, which is s compound of Formula I:<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions useful in treating cancer in a mammal.  The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention comprises two compounds:  a first compound which is paclitaxel, taxotere or a modified taxane or taxoid analog and a second compound of Formula I as further described below.  Each compound is present in the pharmacuetical composition in an effective amount.  One or more of each type of compound can be present in the pharmaceutical composition or administered in the present method.  As used herein the term "an effective amount" refers to an amount sufficient to elicit the desired biological response.  In the instant invention, the desired biological response is inhibition (partial or total) of formation of a tumor or a hematological malignancy, reversal of the development of a<br><br>
solid tumor or other malignancy or prevention or reduction of its further progression.<br>
PACLITAXEL, TAXOTERE OR A MODIFIED TAXANE OR TAXOID ANALOG<br>
Paclitaxel (Taxol®), which is one example of a first compound of the pharmaceutical composition, is a diterpene isolated from the bark of the Western (Pacific) yew, Taxus brevifolia  and is representative of a class of therapeutic agent having a taxane ring system.  The formula for paclitaxel is:<br><br>
Paclitaxel and its analogs have been produced by partial synthesis from 10-deacetylbaccatin III, a precursor obtained from yew needles and twigs, and by total synthesis.  See Holton, et  al., J.   Am. Chem.   Soc.   216:1597-1601 (1994) and Nicolaou, et al.,   Nature 367:630 (1994). Paclitaxel has been demonstrated to possess antineoplastic activity.  More recently, it was shown that the antitumor activity of paclitaxel is due to a promotion of microtubule polymerization.  See Kumar, N., J.   Biol. Chem.   256:10435-10441 (1981); Rowinsky, et al., J.   Natl.   Cancer Inst. £2:1247-1259 (1990); and Schiff, et al..   Nature  277:655-667 (1379).  Paclitaxel has now demonstrated efficacy in several human tumors in clinical trials.  See McGuire  et<br><br>
al.,   Ann.   Int.   Med.   112:237-279 (1989); Holmes, et al.,   J. Natl.   Cancer Inst.   S3-.1797-1805 (1991); Kohn et al. ,   J. Natl.   Cancer Inst.   86:18-24 (1994); and Kohn, et al., American Society for Clinical  Oncology 12   (1993). Paclitaxel is available from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, New York, NY by the registered tradename Taxol®.<br>
The first compound in the pharmaceutical composition is typically paclitaxel (Taxol ®), taxotere or a modified taxane or taxoid analog.  The modified taxane or taxoid analogs are those compounds having a taxane ring bearing modified side chains.  A number of these analogs have improved properties, such as greater water solubility and stability than that of naturally occurring paclitaxel.  For example, RPR109881 is a new oral and iv active taxoid analog under development by Rhone-Foulenc Rhorer and currently in Phase I Clinical Trials.  These analogs are known to those of skill in the art and are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,278,324; 5,272,171; 5,254,580; 5,250,683; 5,248,796; and 5,227,400, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Taxotere can be prepared by the method in WO 93/18210, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. In particular embodiments, tiie first compound in the pharmaceutical composition is paclitaxel or taxotere.<br>
COMPOUNDS OF FORMULA. 1<br>
A number of short peptides with significant activity as inhibitors of cell growth have been isolated from the Indian Ocean sea hare Dolabella  auricularia   (Bai, et al., Bivchem.   Pharmacology,   40:   1859-18G4 (1990); Beckwith et PA . ,   J.   Natl.   Cancer Inst.,   85: 483-488 (1993) and references cited therein).  These include Dolastatins 1-10 (U.S. Patent No. 4,616,444, issued to Pettit et al.)   and Dolastatin-15 {European Patent Application No. 398558) . Dolastatin-15, for example, markedly inhibits the growth of<br><br>
the National Cancer Institute's P3B8 lymphocytic leukemia cell line, a strong predictor of efficacy against various types of human malignancies.  This compound, however, is present only in trace quantities in the sea hare and is difficult to isolate, expensive to synthesize and suffers from poor aqueous solubility.<br>
The compounds of Formula I are derivatives of Dolastatin-15, which overcome the above-mentioned disadvantages of Dolastatin-15 while retaining antineoplastic actii'ity or exhibiting greater antineoplastic activity than the natural product. The Dolastatin-15 derivatives of Formula I, which are employed in combination with paclitaxel, taxotere or a modified taxane or taxoid analog in the present invention, can be synthesized, as described herein and in related copending application U. S.S.N. 06/472,453, filed June 7, 1995, the teachings of which are incorporated herein in their entirety.<br>
The Dolastatin-15 derivatives of Jcrmula I generally comprise L-amino acids, but they can also contain one or more D-amino acids, as described in related copending application U.S.S.N. OB/472,453 filed on June 7, 1995.  Th compounds of Formula I can also be present as salts with physiologically-compatible acids, such as, but not .limited to, hydrochloric acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, lactic acid, phosphoric acid, methanesulfonic acid, acetic acid, formic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, malic acid, succinic acid, malonic acid, sulfuric acid, L-glutamic acid, L-aspartic acid, pyruvic acid, mucic acid, benzoic acid, glucuronic acid, oxalic acid, ascorbic acid and acetylglycine.<br>
For purposes of the present invention, the term "monovalent radical" is intended to mean an electrically neutral molecular fragment capable of forming one covalent bond v.-ith a second neutral molecular fragment.  Monovalent<br><br>
radicals include the hydrogen atom, alkyl groups (e.g. methyl, ethyl, propyl and tert-butyl groups), cycloalkyl groups, hydroxy alkyl groups, adamantyl groups, halogen atoms (e.g. fluorine, chlorine and bromine atoms), aryl groups (e.g. phenyl, benzyl and naphthyl groups) and alkoxy groups (e.g. methoxy and ethoxy groups).  Two monovalent radicals on adjacent sigma-bonded atoms can also form a pi bond between the adjacent atoms.  Two monovalent radicals may also be linked together, for example, by a polymethylene unit to form a cyclic structure.  For example, the unit -N<r wherein r and are monovalent radicals can together with the nitrogen atom form a heterocyclic ring. in addition two bonded to same also divalent radical such as an alkylidene group for example propylidene or oxygen atom.></r>

In another aspect, the present invention comprises a method for partially or totally inhibiting formation of, or otherwise treating (e.g., reversing or inhibiting the further development of) solid tumors (e.g., tumors of the lui-q, breast, colon, prostate, bladder, rectum, or endometrium) or hematological malignancies (e.g., leukemias, lymphomas} in a mammal, for example, a human, by administering to the mammal an effective amount of a first compound which is paclitaxel, taxotere or a modified taxane<br><br>
or taxoid analog and administering an effective amount of a second compound, which is a compound of Formula I.<br>
The two compounds are administered in combination according to the invention.  The term in combination in this context means that the drugs are given either simultaneously or sequentially.  If given sequentially, one of the two compounds is usually detectable in the serum of the subject at the onset of administration of the other compound.  In one embodiment, a compound of Formula I is administered first, followed by administration of the above described first compound, such as paclitaxel.  In a specific embodiment, paclitaxel is administered about one hour after administration of a compound of Formula I. Alternatively, the first compound and the second compound can be administered simultaneously, or the first compound could be administered first, followed by administration of a second compound, which is a compound of Formula I.<br>
The first and the second compounds nay be administered alone or with a pharmaceutically accepted carrier or diluent appropriate for the desired route of administration.  Administration can be by any of the means which are conventional for pharmaceutical, preferably oncological, agents, including oral and parenteral means such as subcutaneously, intravenously, intramuscularly, ir.traperitoneally, nasally or rectally.  Such pharmaceutical compositions may also contain other therapeutically active ingredients.<br>
The dosage administered to the mammal, such as a human, includes a combination of an effective amount of a compound of Formula I and an effective amount of paclitaxel, taxotere or modified taxane or taxoid analog, as described herein.  For a particular condition or method of treatment, the dosage can be determined empirically, using known methods, and will depend upon factors such as the biological activity, mechanism of action, cross<br><br>
resistance, overlapping toxicity and toxicity profile of the particular compounds employed; the means  of =dministration; the age, health and body weight of the ecipient; the nature and extent of the symptoms; the requency of treatment; the administration of other herapies; and the effect desired.<br>
A typical daily dose of the compounds of Formula I ;ill be from about 5 to about 250 milligrams per kilogram &gt;f body weight by oral administration and from about 1 to ibout 100 milligrams per kilogram of body weight by parenteral administration.  A typical daily dose of saclitaxel, taxotere or a modified taxane or taxoid analog ■■■ill generally be from 5 to about 250 milligrams per cilogram.<br>
The first and the second compounds of the present invention can be administered in conventional solid or liquid pharmaceutical administration forms, for example, jncoated or (film)coated tablets, capsules, powders, granules, suppositories or solutions.  These are produced in a conventional manner.  The active substances can for this purpose be processed with conventional pharmaceutical aids such as tablet binders, fillers, preservatives, tablet disintegrants, flow regulators, plasticizers, wetting agents, dispersants, emulsifiers, solvents, sustained release compositions, antioxidants and/or propellant gases (cf. H. Sucker et si.;   Pharmazeutische Technologie, Thieme-Verlag, Stuttgart, 1978).  The administration forms obtained in this way typically contain from about 1 to about 90% by weight of the active substance.<br>

SYKTHETIC METHODS<br>
The compounds of Formula I can be prepared by known methods of peptide synthesis such as those described herein and, in U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 08/470,453 filed June 7, 1995, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference.  The peptides can be assembled sequentially from individual amino acids or by linking<br><br>
suitable small peptide fragments.  In sequential assembly, the peptide chain is extended stepwise, starting at the C-terminus, by one amino acid per step.  In fragment coupling, fragments of different lengths can be linked together, ; and the fragments can also be obtained by sequential assembly from amino acids or by fragment coupling of still shorter peptides.<br>
In both sequential assembly and fragment coupling it is necessary to link the units by forming an amide linkage, which can be accomplished via a variety of enzymatic and chemical methods.  The methods described herein for formation of peptidic amide linkages, are also suitable for the formation of non-peptidic amide linkages.<br>
Chemical methods for forming the amide linkage are described in detail in standard references on peptide chemistry, including Muller, Methoden der oraanischen Chemie Vol. XV/2, 1-364,   Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart, {1974); Stewart and Young, Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis. 31-34 and 71-82, Pierce Chemical Company, Rockford, IL (1984); Bodanszky et al.,   Peptide Synthesis. 65-128, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, (1976); Practice of Peptide Svnthesisr H. Bodansky, A. Bodansky, Springer-Verlag, 1994 and other standard works in peptide chemistry.  Preferred methods include the azide method, the symmetric and mixed anhydride method, the use of in situ  generated or preformed active esters, the use of urethane protected N-carboxy anhydrides of amino acids and the formation of the amide linkage using coupling reagents, such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC), l-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-l,2-dihydroquinoline (EEDQ), pivaloyl chloride, l-ethyl-3- (3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDCI), n-propane-phosphonic anhydride (PPA), N,N-bis {2-oxo-3-oxazolidinyl)amido phosphoryl chloride (B0P-C1) bromo-tris-pyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBrop), diphenylphosphoryl azide (DPPA), Castro's reaoent<br><br>
(BOP, PyBop), 0-benzotriazolyl-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyluronium salts (HBTU), 0-azabenzotriazolyl-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyliironiiim salts (TATU), diethylphosphoryl cyanide (DEPCN), 2,5-diphenyl-2,3-dihydro-3-oxo-4-hydroxythiophene dioxide (Steqlich's  reagent; HOTDO), and 1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI).  The coupling reagents can be employed alone or in combination with additives such as N,N-dimethyl- 4~aminopyridine (DMAPJ,<br>
N-hydroxy-benzotriazole (HOBt), N-hydroxybenzotriazine (HOOBt), N-hydroxysuccinimide (HOSu) or 2-hydroxypyridine.<br>
Although the use of protecting groups is generally not necessary in enzymatic peptide synthesis, reversible protection of reactive groups not involved in formation of the amide linkage is necessary for both reactants in chemical synthesis.  Three conventional protective group techniques typically used for chemical peptide synthesis are: the benzyloxycarbonyl (Z), the t-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) and the 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) techniques. Identified in each case is the protective group on the a-amino group of the chain-extending unit.  A detailed review of amino-acid protective groups is given by Muller, Methpden der oraanischen Chemie Vol. XV/l, pp 20-90G, Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart (1974). .<br>
The units employed for assembling the peptide chain can be reacted in solution, in suspension or by a method sirr.ilar to that described by Merrifield in J.  Amer.   Chem. Soc.   85   (1953) 2149.  In one method, peptides are assembled sequentially or by fragment coupling using the 2, Boc or Fmoc protective group technique, with one of the reactants in the Merrifield technique being bonded to an insoluble polymeric support (also called resin hereinafter).  This typically entails assembling the peptide sequentially on the polymeric support using the Boc or Fmoc protective group technique, with the growing peptide chain covalently bonded at the C terminus to the insoluble resin partic]es.<br><br>
This procedure allows the removal of reagents and by¬products by filtration, eliminating the need to recrystallize intermediates.<br>
The protected amino acids can be linked to any suitable polymer, which must be insoluble in the solvents used and have a stable physical form which permits filtration.  The polymer must contain a functional group to which the first protected amino acid can be covalently attached.  A wide variety of polymers are suitable for this purpose, for example, cellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, polymethacrylate, sulfonated polystyrene, chloromethylated styrene/divinylbenzene copolymer (Merrifield resin), 4-methylbenzhydrylamine resin (MBHA-resin), phenylacetamidomethyl resin (Pam-resin), p-benzyloxy-benzyl-alcohol-resin, benzhydryl-amine-resin '^HA-resin), 4-(hydroxymethyl)-benzoyl-oxymethyl-resin, the resin of Breipohl ed al.    (Tetrahedron Letters  28   (1987) 565; supplied by BACHEM), 4-(2,4-dimethoxyphenylaminomethyl) phenoxy resin [supplied by Novabiocherr.) or o-chlorotrityl-resin (supplied by Biohellas).<br>
Solvents suitable for peptide synthesis include any solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions, for example, water, H,N-dimethylformamide (DKF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), acetonitrile, dichloromethane (DCM), 1,4-dioxane, tetrahydrofuran (THF), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone {!"■:?) and mixtures of these solvents.<br>
Peptide synthesis on the polymeric support can be carried out in a suitable inert organic solvent in which the amino acid derivatives and starting materials employed are soluble.  Particularly useful solvents are, for example,   DMF, DCM, NMP, acetonitrile, DMSO and mixtures thereof, due to their resin swelling properties.<br>
Following synthesis, the peptide is removed [commonly referred to as cleaved) from the polymeric support.  The conditions under which this cleavage is accomplished are<br><br>
well known in the art of peptide synthesis and depend in part on the type of resin employed.  The cleavage reactions most commonly used are acid- or palladium-catalyzed, the acid catalyzed cleavage being conducted in, for example, liquid anhydrous hydrogen fluoride, anhydrous trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, dilute or concentrated trifluoroacetic acid, and acetic acid/dichloromethane/ trifluoroethanol mixtures.  The palladium-catalyzed cleavage can be carried out in THF or THF-DCM-mixtures in the presence of a weak base such as morpholine.  Certain protecting groups are also cleaved off under these condi tionp.<br>
Partial deprotection of the peptide may also be necessary prior to certain derivatization reactions.  For example, peptides dialkylated at the N-terminus can be prepared either by coupling the appropriate N,N-di-alkylamino acid to the peptide in solution or on the polymeric support or by reductive alkylation of the resin-bound peptide in DMF/1% acetic acid with NaCNBH3 and the appropriate aldehyde or by hydrogenation of the peptide in solution in the presence of aldehyde or ketone and Pd/C.<br>
The various non-naturally occurring amino acids as well as the various non-amino acid moieties disclosed herein may be obtained from commercial sources or synthesized from commercially-available materials usina methods known in the art.  For example, amino acid building blocks with R1 and R2 moieties can be prepared according to E. Wuensch, Huben Keyl, Hethoden der oroanischen Phpmii&gt; Vol. XV/i, p. 3 06, Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart (1974) and literature cited therein.  Peptides with gamma-or delta-lactam bridges can be prepared by incorporating the appropriate lactam-bridged dipeptide units (R. Freidinger, J. Org.   Chem.   (1982) 104-109) into the peptide chain. Peptides with thiazole-, oxazol-, thiazolin- or oxazolin-containing dipeptide building blocks can be prepared by<br><br>
Incorporating the appropriate dipeptidic units (P. Jouin et il..   Tetrahedron  Letters   (1992), pp. 20B7-2810; P. Wipf et 32.,    Tetrahedon  Letters   {1992),   pp. 907-910;   W.R. Tully, J. tfed. Chem.    (1991), p 206S;  Synthesis (1987), p 235) into<br>

GENERAL SYNTHETIC PROCEDURES<br>
I.   Compounds of Formula I of the present invention are either synthesized by classical solution synthesis using standard Z-   and Boc-methocclagy as  described above or by standard methods of solid-phase synthesis on a completely automatic model 431A synthesizer supplied by APPLIED BIOSYSTEMS.  The apparatus uses different synthetic cycles for the Boc and Fmoc protective group techniques.<br>
In the case of solid phase synthesis, the N,N-dialkyl-penta- or hexapeptide acids are liberated from the solid support and further coupled with the corresponding C-terminal amines in solution.  BOP-Cl and PyBrop were used as reagents for coupling of the amino acid following the N-methylamino acids.  The reaction times were correspondingly increased.  For reductive alkylation of the N-terminus, the peptide-resin was deprotected at the N terminus and then reacted with a 3 - fold molar excess of aldehyde or<br><br>
ketone in DMF/1% acetic acid with addition of 3 equivalents of NaCNBH3.  After the reaction was complete (negative Kaiser test) the resin was washed several times with water, isopropanol, DMF and<br>
dichloromethane.<br>
In solution synthesis, the use of either Boc~protected amino acid NCAs (N-tert-butyloxycarbonyl-amino acid-N-carboxy-anhydrides), Z-protected amino acid NCAs (N-benzyloxycarbonyl-amino acid-N-carboxy-anhydrides), or the use of pivaloylchloride as  condensing agent respectively is most advantageous for coupling of the amino acid following the N-methylamino acids. Reductive alkylation of the N terminus can, for example, be achieved by reaction of the N-terminally deprotected peptides or amino acids with the corresponding aldehydes or ketones using NaCNBH3 or hydrogen, Pd/C.

11.	Reductive Alkylation of the H-terminus<br>
The peptide-resin prepared in la or lb above was deprotected at the N-terminus (steps 2-4 in lb or 1-6 in la) and then reacted with a 3-fold molar excess of aldehyde or ketone in DMF/1% acetic acid with addition of 3 equivalents of NaCNBHj.  After reaction was complete (negative Kaiser test) the resin was washed several times with water, isopropanol, DMF and dichloromethane.<br>
III. Workup of the peptide-resins obtained as in la and II The peptide-resin w&amp;s  dried under reduced pressure and transferred into a reaction vessel of a TEFLON HF apparatus -(supplied by PENINSULA).  Addition of a scavenger, for example,, anisole (Iml/g of resin) , and in the case of tryptophan-containing peptides of a thiol to remove the indolic formyl group, for example, ethanedithiol (0.5 ml/g of resin), was followed by condensing in hydrogen fluoride (10 ml/g of resin) while cooling with liquid N2.  The mixture was allowed to warm to 0°C and stirred at this temperature for 45 minutes.  The hydrogen fluoride was then stripped off under reduced pressure, and the residue was washed with ethyl acetate in order to remove remaining scavenger.  The peptide was extracted with 30% acetic acid and filtered, and the filtrate was lyophilized.<br><br>
Work-up of the peptide-resins obtained as in lb and II<br>

The filtrate and the washings were concentrated, and the peptide was precipitated by addition of the diethyl ether.  After cooling in an ice bath, the precipitate was filtered off, taken up in 30% acetic acid and lyophilized.<br>
When an o-chlorotrityl-resin (supplied by Biohellas) is used, the suspension of the peptide-resin in an acetic acid/ trifluoroethanol/ dichlorcmethane mixture (1.-1:3) is stirred at room temperature for 1 h.  The resin is then filtered off with suction and thoroughly washed with the cleavage solution.  The combined filtrates are concentrated in vacuo and treated with water.  The precipitated solid is removed by filtration or centrifugation,. washed with diethyl ether and dried under reduced pressure.<br><br>
VI.  Purification and characterization of the peptides Purification was carried out by gel chromatography (SEPHADEX G-10, G-15/l0% HOAc, SEPHADEX LH20/MeOH) medium pressure chromatography {stationary phase:  HD-SIL C-18, 20-45 micron, 100 Angstrom; mobile phase: gradient with A=0.1% TFA/MeOH, B«0.1V TFA/water) or preparative HPLC (stationary phase: water Delta-Pak C-18,   15 micron, 100 Angstrom; mobile phase: gradient with A= 0.1% TFA/MeOH, B= 0.1% TFA/water).<br>
The purity of the resulting products was determined by analytical HPLC (stationary phase: 100 2.1 mm VYDAC C-18, 51, 300 Angstrom; mobile phase: acetonitrile-water gradient, buffered with 0.1% TFA, 40°C&gt;.<br>

EVALUATION OF BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY In vivo  Methodology<br>
The combination of a compound of Formula I and paclitaxel, taxotere or a modified taxane or taxoid analog<br>
was further tested in various preclinical assays for in vivo activity, which are indicative of clinical utility. The P388 (ascites model), LX-1, CX-1 and PC-3 (human tumor xenograft models for lung, colon and prostate) tumor models are all suitable for use in this invention.<br>
In general, any dosing regimen which appears to provide an acceptable level of antitumor activity for both agents is suitable.  Any acceptable method of drug administration can be used in the combination therapy of this invention and can be determined using techniques well known to those of skill in the art.  In addition, the drugs can be administered either simultaneously or sequentially, in any order. ^3 8 8 MODEL<br>
The P3SS tumor model employs a murine lymphocytic leukemia cell line (See Schabel et al.,   Pharmac.   Ther.   A, 1:411-435).  The P3B8 tumor cells used in this invention, were harvested from donor mice by peritoneal lavage at day 7 poFt transplant.  lxlO6 F388 tumor cells were then implanted intraperitoneally in a volume of 0.5 ml in mice.<br>
A typical dosing regimen includes initiation of i  treatment approximately one day post transplant followed by treatment on days 5 and 9 post transplant.  Generally the compounds of Formula I are administered intravenously (i.v.) and the paclitaxel, taxotere or modified taxane or taxoid analog is administered intraperitoneally (i.p.).<br><br>
Therapeutic results of the combinations df the invention against P388 cells, are presented in terms of increase in lifespan reflected by the relative median survival time (MST) of treated (T) versus control (C) group {survival period for untreated mice is generally in the range of 11 to 13 days) and is represented as %T/C values. According to the National Cancer Institute guidelines a VT/C in the range or 128-190* indicates a drug with moderate to good activity.  In addition, the Net log Cell Kill is used to compare efficacy of different schedules and combinations, and is calculated as follows:<br>
Net log Cell Kill = ffT-C) - duration of_treatment I x 0.332<br>
Doubling Time<br>
Jvhere,<br>
Doubling Time = time required for control tumors to double once (0.4 days).<br>
T and C = the median survival time (days) for the control (C) and treated (T) mice. Duration of: treatment with drug 0.332 = Derived constant<br>
A positive  Net log Cell Kill number indicates that fever tumor eel1, r.   are present at the end of treatment.  A negative number indicates that the tumor was still growing during treatment.<br>
EXAKPLE 3:  Combination Treatment Using Compound (xvii) and Paclitaxel in the P3S8 Tumor Model<br>
1 x 106 P38S tumor cells were transplanted intraperitonmlly in a volume of 0.5 ml in mice.  Treatment was initiated approximately 1 day later followed by treatment on both day 5 and day 9, post transplant. Compound (xvii) was administered IV while paclitaxel was administered IP.  Compound (xvii) was administered at either 20, 40 or 60 mg/kg and paclitaxel at either 10, 20<br><br>
;&gt;r 30 mg/kg.  The dosing was sequential with compouond ixvii) being administered first followed by paclitaxel one nour later. RESULTS:<br>
The results from Example 3 are shown in Table 1.  The data in Table 1 shows that single drug treatment resulted in an optimal %T/C of 175% for compound (xvii) corresponding to a Net log Cell Killing (NICK) of 0.66 when administered intravenously at a dose of 60 mg/kg and an optimal %T/C of 1B3% corresponding to a NICK of 1.33 for paclitaxel when administered intraperitoneally at a dose of 10 mg/kg.  For combination drug treatment the data of Table 1 show that the combination of 60 mg/kg (xvii) and 20 mg/kg of paclitaxel resulted in a significant ircrease in life span (P Value less than 0.001, as determined by the Mann-Whitney Test) and an optimal VT/C value of 242% corresponding to a NICK of 5.98 with 38% of the animals surviving more than 60 days. HUMAN TUMOR XENOGRAFTS MODEL<br>
Human tumors from lung {LX-D, colon (CX-1) and prostate (PC-3) which had been grown in athymic nude mice were transplanted (xenografted) into new recipient mice, as is well known in the art.  The transplanted tumor fragments were approximately 50 mg in size.  The day of transplantation was designated as day 0.  The combination therapy of the present invention was evaluated for anti¬tumor efficacy following administration to the xenograft-bearing mice.<br>
Combination therapy was accomplished by intravenous administration of both drugs.  The Q2dx3; 5, 12 and.19 injection schedule was followed with paclitaxel being administered one hour after Compound (xvii).  in other words, treatment consisted of 3 cycles, starting on days 5, 12 and 19 post tumor implantation.  One cycle of treatment consisted of treatment every other day for a total of three<br><br>
times.  The optimal dose for single dose administration of both Compound (xvii) and paclitaxel used in the LX-1 and CX-i types of human xenograft models tested, can be found in Tables 2-3, with no optimal dose determined with the PC-3 model.<br>
Tumor diameters and body weights were measured twice weekly.  Tumor volumes were calculated using the diameters measured with Vernier calipers, and the formula:<br>
(length x width2} / 2 ■= mg of tumor weight<br>
Mean tumor weights (KTW) were calculated for each treatment group, and T/C values determined for each group relative to the untreated control tumors.<br>
Results are also presented as Net log Cell Kill and are calculated as follows:<br>
Net log Cell Kill = \ (T-C) - duration of treatment! x 0.332<br>
Doubling Time<br>
T and C = The median days required for the control and<br>
treated tumors to reach a specified tumor size, in this<br>
instance 2000 mm3 .<br>
Doubling Time = Time required for control tumors to double<br>
in size.<br>
0.332 = Derived constant<br>
EXAMPLE 4:  Combination Treatment Using Compound 103793 and Paclitaxel in the LX-1 Human Tumor Xenograft Model The Q2dx3; 5, 12 and 19 dosing regimen described above was used in this example.  Paclitaxel was administered IV one hour after Compound (xvii) was administered IV.  The optimal single dose of both paclitaxel and Compound (xvii) can be determined from Table 2.<br><br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 5.-  Combination Treatment Using Compound 103793 and Paclitaxel in the CX-1 Human Tumor Xenograft Model The Q2dx3; 5, 12 and 19 dosing regimen described above was used in this example.  Paclitaxel was administered IV one hour after Compound (xvii) was administered IV.  The optimal single dose of both paclitaxel and Compound (xvii) can be determined from Table 3.<br>
EXAMPLE 6:  Combination Treatment Using Compound 103793 and Paclitaxel in the PC-3 Human Tumor Xenograft Model The Q2dx3; 5, 12 and 19 dosing regimen described above was  used in  this example.  Paclitaxel was administered IP one hour after Compound (xvii) was administered IV.  The optimal single dose of both paclitaxel and Compound (xvii) was  not determined.<br>
RESULTS:<br>
The results obtained using the Human Xenograft Model to assess anti-tumor efficacy of the combination therapy of the present invention are presented in Tables 2-4.  The data presented represents results from preliminary experiments. The  data in Table 2 show that the optimal combination of compound (xvii) and paclitaxel was 15 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg respectively, in the LX-1 model.  The combination resulted in some regressions and tumor growth delay.  However, the same combination schedule in the CX-1 model did not result in any advantage over the single drug treatment as  shown in Table 3.<br>
In the PC-3 model, there was no beneficial effect of the combination as compared to single drug treatment. However, the optimal dose for single dose administration was not determined.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
