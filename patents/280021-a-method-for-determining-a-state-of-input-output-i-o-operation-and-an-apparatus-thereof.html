				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
An oral rinse formulation for the treatment or prophylaxis of mucositis or stomatitis comprises<br>
one or more of the following components in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
excipients or additives: a) at least one corticosteroid; b) at least one anti-histamine; c) at least one<br>
topical anaesthetic; and, d) at least one anti-fungal antibiotic agent. A stable nystatin containing<br>
formulation is also provided comprising a buffering agent, a preservative, a chelating agent and<br>
an anti-oxidant.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to oral hygiene and in particular, to mouthwashes for the treatment<br>
and prophylaxis of mucositis and stomatitis of the oral cavity and to a method of using such a<br>
mouthwash.<br>
Mouthwashes are typically used as part of an oral hygiene regime which may also include<br>
brushing and flossing to maintain a satisfactory level of oral hygiene. Such mouthwashes are<br>
generally classified as cosmetic, therapeutic or a combination of the two. Cosmetic rinses are<br>
commercial over-the-counter products that help remove oral debris before or after brushing,<br>
temporarily suppress bad breath, diminish bacteria in the mouth and refresh the mouth with a<br>
pleasant taste. Therapeutic rinses often have the benefits of their cosmetic counterpart, but also<br>
contain an added active ingredient, for example chlorhexidine that helps protect against some<br>
oral diseases such as gingivitis. Typically, such mouthwashes are alcohol-based.<br>
However, available mouthwashes are unsuitable for hospital patients presenting with oral<br>
complications as a result of, for example, infection or other lesions as a consequence of<br>
chemotherapy or radiotherapy for the treatment of neoplastic disease. Such oral complications<br>
may include mucositis or stomatitis. Mucositis or stomatitis presents in approximately 40% of<br>
patients with neoplastic disease.<br>
Examples of chemotherapeutic drugs that frequently cause mucositis and/or stomatitis include<br>
alkylating agents, for example melphalan and busulphan; antimetabolites, for example,<br>
cytarabine, floxuridine, 5-fluorouracil, mercaptopurine, methotrexate, and thioguanine and<br>
cytotoxic drugs, for example, bleomycin, actinomycin D, daunorubicin, cisplatin, etoposide,<br>
mytomycin, vinblastine and vincristine.<br>
3<br>
The terms mucositis and stomatitis are often used interchangeably but may include some general<br>
distinctions. Mucositis describes a toxic inflammatory reaction affecting the gastro-intestinal<br>
tract, which may result from exposure to chemotherapeutic agents or ionizing radiation.<br>
Mucositis typically manifests as an erythematous burn-like lesion, or as random focal-to-diffuse<br>
lesions. Stomatitis refers to an inflammatory reaction affecting the oral mucosa, with or without<br>
ulceration, that may be caused or intensified by pharmacological, particularly chemotherapeutic<br>
treatments or by radiotherapy. Stomatitis can range from mild to severe; a patient presenting<br>
with the severe stomatitis is unable to take anything by mouth.<br>
Current oral cleaning care in such patients may include gently cleaning the mouth, moisturizing<br>
the lips and mouth, and relieving pain and swelling. A soft toothbrush cleans teeth well and<br>
gently. Cleansing agents can include “salt and soda” (half a teaspoon of salt and two tablespoons<br>
of sodium bicarbonate in 32 ounces of warm water), saline, sterile water or sodium bicarbonate<br>
(one teaspoon in 8 ounces of water). Hydrogen peroxide diluted in equal amounts of water or<br>
weak salt water can be used in some cases. Mostly, physicians have resorted to these rather<br>
limited, temporary relief options.<br>
It is therefore extremely important that mucositis and stomatitis be prevented whenever possible<br>
or at the very least that they be reduced in their severity and possible complications. Currently<br>
there are a number of intervening therapies to choose from. For example, The Joanna Briggs<br>
Institute of The Royal Adelaide Hospital has provided some guidance on the treatment of<br>
mucositis. However, there is no high quality synthesis of research evidence for these<br>
intervention therapies (www.joannabriggs.edu.au/best_practice/bp5.php, 19 February 2004).<br>
Of particular interest to the current application are the variety of mouthwashes previously used<br>
having mixed actions against mucositis and stomatitis. Such mouthwashes typically include<br>
benzydamine hydrochloride, corticosteroids and chamomile<br>
(www.joannabriggs.edu.au/best_practise/bp5.php).<br>
Formulations such as those disclosed in U.S. 5,635,489; U.S. 4,961,926 and U.S. 5,102,870<br>
describe the use of growth factors and stimulation factors such as granulocyte-macrophage<br>
colony stimulating factor and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor.<br>
Further attempts at treatment and or prophylaxis of mucositis and stomatitis include the use of<br>
nucleoside derivatives which can be formulated into lozenges or mouthwashes and the like to<br>
4<br>
coat the oral cavity or other mucosal areas such as disclosed in U.S. Patent Publication No.<br>
2003/0236217 A1.<br>
Other formulations include tetracycline as disclosed in U.S. 6,946,118; hyaluronic acid,<br>
glycyrrhetinic acid and polyvinylpyrrolidone in mixture with excipients and adjuvants as<br>
disclosed in U.S. 6,828,308; the use of an anti-microbial peptide, preferably protegrin applied<br>
topically which has broad spectrum anti-microbial activity, good stability and adheres well to all<br>
mucosa as disclosed in U.S. 6,025,326; the use of glutamine as disclosed in U.S. 5,545,668 and<br>
the use of triclosan as disclosed in U.S. 5,945,089<br>
Despite the widespread recognition that mucositis is a serious problem, no effective treatment<br>
currently exists and, more often than not, any level of patient care is typically palliative. In<br>
addition to the lack of effective treatments for mucositis, physicians are unsure of the exact<br>
mechanism by which the ulcerations occur in mucositis. It is known that the initial exposure to a<br>
chemotherapeutic agent causes a release of cytokines from the epithelial tissues. Subsequently,<br>
mitosis is disturbed in the epithelia. Finally, there are alterations in the bacterial flora of the oral<br>
cavity. It is unknown which of these occurrences, if any, is responsible for the mucosal damage.<br>
Despite the fact that significant quantities or inflammatory mediators are released by the<br>
epithelium, conventional anti-inflammatory agents have been unsuccessful in human efficacy<br>
studies of the disease.<br>
Some of the known and effective treatments for mucositis involves the use of the antibiotics<br>
nystatin and amphotericin B. These drugs have been used for the preventive and curative<br>
treatment of fungal infections such as oral candidiasis and, in particular, for cancer patients. Due<br>
to a lack of commercially available anti-fungal mouthwashes, oral or mouth rinse formulations<br>
containing these antifungal agents are commonly prepared in a clinical setting for immediate use.<br>
One possible reason for the lack of nystatin and/or amphotericin B mouth rinse formulations is<br>
that such formulations are relatively unstable and, therefore, must be used within a short period<br>
of time. For example, in one study of mixtures of nystatin and amphotericin B, in combination<br>
with sodium bicarbonate, it was determined that the maximum amount of time that such<br>
formulations can remain stable is roughly 3 to 4 days (J. Groeschke, et al.; Stability of<br>
Amphotericin B and Nystatin in Antifungal Mouthrinses Containing Sodium Hydrogen<br>
Carbonate, J. Pharm. and Biomed. Anal., v. 42, 3 (2006), pp. 362-366).<br>
5<br>
Thus, the available mouthwashes are effective at treating only one aspect of mucositis and other<br>
oral complications and not treating the complete range of symptoms that present in patients.<br>
Further, the effective antifungal mouth rinses have a very limited stability. There exists a need,<br>
therefore, for a stable formulation for treating a variety of symptoms and causes of mucositis.<br>

- an antioxidant.<br>
In one embodiment, the anti-fungal agent is chosen from nystatin and amphotericin B. In a<br>

formulation preferably also includes at least one corticosteroid, at least one antihistamine, and at<br>
least one topical anaesthetic. More preferably, the anti-fungal agent of this formulation<br>
comprises nystatin or amphotericin B and, most preferably, nystatin.<br>
Preferably, the mouthwash in accordance with the present invention is used in the treatment<br>
and/or prophylaxis of oral conditions such as mucositis and/or stomatitis.<br>
Although the mouthwash (or mouth rinse) of the present invention includes various components<br>
that are known in the art, the inventors note that there is no commercially available formulation<br>
that combines the subject components to provide an effective, single formulation that addresses a<br>
large variety of symptoms associated with mucositis and/or stomatitis. This is also clearly<br>
indicated in the recent article by J. Groeschke, et al. Further, in addition to providing such<br>
multipurpose formulation, the inventors have also found an unexpectedly high stability of the<br>
9<br>
formulation, particularly when an anti-fungal is included. More specifically, the formulation<br>
described below including nystatin was found to be stable for over 2 months, thereby greatly<br>
exceeding the stability expected according to the prior art, such as the article by J. Groeschke, et<br>
al.<br>
Preferably the mouthwash in accordance with the present invention further comprises water and<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable excipients or additives such as:<br>
- one or more oils, such as an oil selected from the group comprising anethole, anisole, camphor,<br>
methyl salicylate, vanillin, eugenol, furaneol, linalool, menthol, thymol, cinnamaldehyde, citral,<br>
methyl butanoate, pentylbutanoate, pentylpentanoate, tea tree oil, peppermint oil, spearmint oil,<br>
pineapplemint oil and eucalyptus oil;<br>
- sweetening agents, for example sorbitol;<br>
- thickening agents, such as xanthan gum, carrageenan, carbomer, or HPMC (hydroxypropyl<br>
methyl cellulose);<br>
- preservative agents, such as sodium benzoate, methyl paraben, or propyl paraben;<br>
- water;<br>
- emulsifiers, such as polysorbate 80 (or Tween™ 80);<br>
- and/or at least one antacid such as aluminium or magnesium hydroxide.<br>
It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that the above list of excipients and/or<br>
additives is provided merely by way of example and that various other such components may be<br>
used in the formulation of the present invention.<br>
Oral mucositis results in specific damage that includes the shedding of the mucosal lining of the<br>
mouth (desquamation), ulceration and atrophy. Aluminum and magnesium hydroxide antacids<br>
coat and protect the oral cavity from damage and provide for re-growth of normal oral tissue.<br>
The corticosteroid component provides anti-inflammatory action directly on the oral mucosa and<br>
works to limit the inflammatory response associated with mucositis. Preferably, the<br>
corticosteroid is dexamethasone.<br>
In patients being treated with chemotherapy and radiation, steps may be taken to prevent<br>
bacterial infection within the oral cavity. For this reason, in an optional embodiment, the<br>
mouthwash formulation of the invention may contain an antibiotic component. Such antibiotic<br>
10<br>
components may be of the macrolide type and may be selected from the group consisting of<br>
erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, dirithromycin, roxithromycin carbomycin A,<br>
josamycin, kitasamycin, oleandomycin, spiramycin, troleandomycin, tylosin, cethromycin,<br>
ansamycin and telithromycin. In one aspect the antibiotic is erythromycin. Once ulcerations<br>
develop inside the mouth, local oral bacteria colonize the wound and release cell wall products<br>
into the mucosa, resulting in an amplification of a tissue destructive cycle. The antibiotic<br>
component, i.e. Erythromycin, limits such bacterial colonization. As will be understood, limiting<br>
the extent of bacterial infection would promote healing of the affected tissues.<br>
Alternatively, the antibiotic may be any of the following, alone or in combination:<br>
- an aminoglycoside, for example, amikacin, gentamicin, kanamycin, neomycin, netilmicin,<br>
streptomycin, and tobramycin;<br>
- a carbacephem, for example, loracarbef;<br>
- a carbapenem, for example, ertapenem, imipenem/cilastatin, and meropenem;<br>
- a cephalosporin (first generation), for example, cefadroxil, cefazolin, cephalexin;<br>
- a cephalosporin (second generation), for example, cefaclor, cefamandole, cefoxitin, cefprozil,<br>
and cefuroxime;<br>
- a cephalosporin (third generation), for example, cefixime, cefdinir, cefditoren, cefoperazone,<br>
cefotaxime, cefpodoxime, ceftazidime, ceftibuten, ceftizoxime, and ceftriaxone;<br>
- a cephalosporin (fourth generation), for example, cefepime;<br>
- a glycopeptide, for example, teicoplanin, vancomycin;<br>
- a penicillin, for example, amoxicillin, ampicillin, azlocillin, carbenicillin, cloxacillin,<br>
dicloxacillin, flucloxacillin, mezlocillin, nafcillin, penicillin, piperacillin and ticarcillin;<br>
- a polypeptide, for example, bacitracin, colistin, and polymyxin B;<br>
- a quinolone, for example, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, lomefloxacin,<br>
moxifloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, and trovafloxacin;<br>
- a sulfonamide, for example, mafenide, prontosil, sulfacetamide, sulfamethizole, sulfanilimide,<br>
sulfasalazine, sulfisoxazole, trimethoprim, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole;<br>
- a tetracycline, for example, demeclocycline, doxycycline, minocycline, and oxytetracycline,<br>
tetracycline, and<br>
11<br>
- another antibiotic, for example, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, ethambutol, fosfomycin,<br>
furazolidone, isoniazid, linezolid, metronidazole, nitrofurantoin, pyrazinamide,<br>
quinupristin/dalfopristin, rifampin, and spectinomycin.<br>
The anti-fungal antibiotic agent may be of the polyene type and may be selected from the group<br>
consisting of nystatin, amphotericin B and natamycin. In one aspect, the anti-fungal agent is<br>
nystatin or amphotericin B.<br>
Patients being treated with chemotherapy and radiation are immuno-compromised. This leads to<br>
not only increased risk of bacterial infection but also to an increased risk of fungal infection, thus<br>
advancing the risk and degree of oral mucositis. Nystatin and amphotericin B act to prevent and<br>
limit the degree of fungal infection.<br>
Alternatively, the anti-fungal compound may be selected from an imidazole, for example,<br>
miconazole, ketoconazole, clotrimazole, econazole, mebendazole, bifonazole, butoconazole,<br>
fenticonazole, isoconazole, oxiconazole, sertaconazole, sulconazole, thiabendazole or<br>
tiaconazole; a triazole, for example, fluconazole, itraconazole, ravuconazole, posaconazole or<br>
voriconazole; an allylamine, for example, terbenafine, amorolfine, naftifine or butenafine or an<br>
echinocandin such as caspofungin or micafungin or any combinations thereof.<br>
The topical anaesthetic may be selected from benzocaine, mepivacaine, ropivacaine,<br>
bupivacaine, lidocaine, prilocaine, procaine, cloroprocaine or tetracaine. In one aspect the<br>
topical anaesthetic is a combination of lidocaine and tetracaine.<br>
Pain associated with oral mucositis can be extremely debilitating and lead to poor oral food<br>
intake. In extreme cases patients may require feeding tubes if the ulceration continues to<br>
advance. Tetracaine and lidocaine act locally to provide relief from pain.<br>
Preferably, the anti-histamine may be selected from the group comprising a first generation H1<br>
receptor antagonist, a second generation H1 receptor antagonist, a third generation H1 receptor<br>
antagonist, a H2 receptor antagonist, a H3 receptor antagonist and a H4 receptor antagonist.<br>
Diphenyhdramine, an antihistamine, helps to sooth soreness, burning, itching (urticaria and<br>
pruritis) and inflammation, symptoms that are normally associate with mucositis.<br>
The first generation H1 receptor antagonist may be selected from an ethylenediamine, for<br>
example, mepyramine or antazoline; an ethanolamine, for example, diphenhydramine,<br>

Examples<br>
The following examples are provided to illustrate the invention and are not intended to limit the<br>
scope of the invention in any way.<br>
Introduction<br>
As discussed above, there are currently no mouth rinses available on the market containing<br>
Nystatin, Dexamethasone sodium phosphate, Lidocaine HCL and Diphenhydramine HCl<br>
available. Moreover, there are no commercially available mouth rinses containing nystatin and<br>
14<br>
this is believed to be mainly due to the poor stability characteristics of formulations containing<br>
this drug. For this reason, various mouth rinse (or mouthwash) formulations were prepared to<br>
study the stability characteristics. The aim of this project was to develop a stable formulation<br>
containing at least nystatin and, preferably the various other treatment agents listed above. As<br>
discussed further below, a prototype formulation was developed and its stability was tested at<br>
room temperature. The product was found to be stable at room temperature for over three<br>
months.<br>
Materials and Methods<br>
Table 1 below summarises the formulations studied. As shown, nine sample preparations were<br>
examined, identified as samples B1 to B9. Where the samples differed in formulation, a notation<br>
is included in Table 1.<br>
The following procedure was typical of that followed in preparing the formulations of the<br>
example. As indicated above, the specific concentrations of the various components for the trials<br>
is indicated Table 1.<br>
Step 1. Preparation of 1.2% HPMC (hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose) solution for the final<br>
volume<br>
1.1) Heat 70 mL DI water to 90°C.<br>
1.2) Slowly add 2.4g HPMC with continuous stirring and heating at 90°C for 1 hour .<br>
1.3) Cool down to room temperature with continuous stirring (about 1 hour).<br>
1.4) Add 130 mL cold DI (de-ionized) water with continuous stirring for 60 minutes.<br>
1.5) Set aside for nystatin suspension preparation in step 3.<br>
Step 2. Preparation of water soluble API’s (active pharmaceutical ingredients) and other<br>
ingredients<br>
2.1) Dissolve 0.60 g methyl paraben (0.2%) and 60 mg propyl paraben (0.02%) in 15.0 g<br>
propylene glycol (5%) and stir at 40°C for 10 min or until completely dissolved.<br>
2.2) Add 3.0g Tween™ 80 (1.0%) then stir for 10 min at 40ºC.<br>
15<br>
2.3) Add 150 mL DI water and cool down to room temperature.<br>
2.4) Add each of the following remaining ingredients and all soluble API’s with continuous<br>
stirring until completely dissolved. No heating.<br>
1.5g citric acid<br>
4.3018 g sodium phosphate dibasic<br>
1.5g sucralose<br>
6.444 mg dexamethasone 21-phosphate disodium salt<br>
581.61 mg diphenhydramine HCl<br>
3.741g lidocaine HCl<br>
Step 3. Preparation of nystatin suspension<br>
3.1) Slowly add 1.6431g nystatin to 120 mL 1.2 % HPMC solution (from step 1 ) with<br>
continuous stirring. The final HPMC concentration in the formulation will therefore be 0.5%.<br>
3.2) Add 0.60 g EDTA (0.2%) and mix well.<br>
Step 4. Mix solution from step 2 and nystatin suspension from step 3. Add 1.2 mL NFB mixed<br>
berry flavor. Mix well.<br>
Step 5. Measure pH. If it is not 6.5±0.5, adjust to pH 6.5±0.5 with 100 mM phosphate buffer<br>
(Na2HPO4).<br>
Step 6. Adjust final volume to 300 mL with water. Mix well and verify pH again.<br>
At the end of Step 6, the formulation (300 ml) will have the composition as listed in the<br>
following table. Items marked as * comprise the active drug ingredients. Items marked as **<br>
comprise the alternative components used for a placebo formulation.<br>

The formulations were stored at room temperature and tested upon formulation (i.e. time = 0)<br>
and at 2, 3 and 4 month time points for identity, potency, pH, preservative assay, physical<br>
appearance and color. Formulation B8 was used for testing stability and the results of this<br>
analysis at the various time points are provided in Tables 2 to 5.<br>
Quantification of the respective ingredients was done using high performance liquid<br>
chromatography (HPLC). A difference in calculated quantity of less than 5% from the intial<br>
formulation (i.e. time = 0) amount was considered a “pass”, that is, indicative of minimal<br>
degradation. The relative standard deviation for the HPLC calculations was ≤ 3%.<br>
For the re-dispersibility study, the following procedure was followed:<br>
- manually shake the sample for 5 seconds.<br>
- observe the bottom of the glass bottle.<br>
17<br>
- if settlement or clumping is found, shake for another 5 seconds and observe.<br>
- the sample is identified as re-dispersible if no settlement or clumping is found on the bottom of<br>
the glass bottle.<br>
Conclusions<br>
All the samples prepared for the stability study were found to meet the desired criteria. The<br>
mouth rinse of the invention was found to be stable, when stored room temperature, for at least<br>
up to 4 months. At “accelerated conditions”, that is when stored at 40°C, the formulation was<br>
found to remain stable for less than 2 months. These results illustrate an unexpected stability of<br>
a nystatin containing formulation particularly when stored at room temperature. The stability of<br>
the nystatin containing formulation is believed to be attributable to the presence of the buffering<br>
agent (pH control), preservatives (i.e. paraben), the chelating agent (i.e. EDTA), and the antioxidant<br>
(i.e. citrate). The data obtained from this study indicates that the formulation of the<br>
invention exhibits long term stability and, therefore, provides a unique, single dose formulation<br>
that addresses various symptoms associated with mucositis.<br>
Although the invention has been described with reference to certain specific embodiments,<br>
various modifications thereof will be apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from<br>
the purpose and scope of the invention as outlined in the claims appended hereto. Any examples<br>
provided herein are included solely for the purpose of illustrating the invention and are not<br>
intended to limit the invention in any way. The disclosures of all prior art recited herein are<br>
