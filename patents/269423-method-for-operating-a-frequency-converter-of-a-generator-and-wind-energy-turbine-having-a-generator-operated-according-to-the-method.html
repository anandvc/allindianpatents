Method for operating a frequency converter of a generator and wind energy<br>
turbine having a generator operated according to the method<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method for operating a frequency converter<br>
of a generator and, in particular, of a generator of a wind energy turbine, in<br>
the event of a substantial grid voltage drop. Moreover, the present invention<br>
also comprises a wind energy turbine having a generator operated accordingly.<br>
Finally, the present invention also provides for the operation of a generator<br>
under normal grid conditions with the generator not being in its operating<br>
state for supplying power to the grid, and a wind energy turbine having a<br>
generator operated accordingly.<br>
Related Prior Art<br>
Electrical power in public power grids is supplied by diverse energy sources<br>
converting mechanical energy into electrical energy. The main energy sources<br>
supporting public power grids are coal power plants and nuclear power plants.<br>
Several other types of energy sources, in particular power plants of<br>
regenerative energy like solar power plants, water power plants or wind<br>
energy turbines, also contribute to support the public power grid.<br>
In the past, In the event of a significant grid voltage drop in a public power<br>
grid, it was required that in such an event wind energy turbines are shut down<br>
automatically. However, due to the increased number of wind energy turbines<br>
1t becomes more and more Important that these turbines support the public<br>
power grid in the event of a substantial grid voltage drop.<br>
In power generators like those used for wind energy turbines, it is known to<br>
couple the rotor windings of the generator via a frequency converter to the<br>
grid. In the frequency converter the frequency of the power generated by the<br>
generator is converted to the frequency of the grid.<br>
In order to support a public power grid, not only real power but also reactive<br>
power has to be supplied. Both the real and the reactive power has to be<br>
controlled by the frequency converter in the event of normal grid conditions.<br>
Methods for controlling the reactive power under normal grid conditions are<br>
described e.g. in DE-A-100 20 635, WO-A-01/20745, WO-A-02/086314, WOA-<br>
02/086315, and EP-A-1 222 389.<br>
From the utility it is more and more required to provide support of the grid by<br>
supplying reactive current in the event of a substantial grid voltage drop or<br>
under normal grid conditions but with the stator windings of the generator<br>
being disconnected from the grid.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a method for operating a frequency converter<br>
of a generator in particular of a wind energy turbine, in the event of a<br>
substantial grid voltage drop, wherein the frequency converter comprises a<br>
generator-side power converter, to be connected to the generator, a grid-side<br>
power converter to be connected to the voltage grid, and a DC link circuit for<br>
connecting the generator-side power converter to the grid-side power<br>
converter, the method comprising the step of controlling the amount of<br>
reactive current to be supplied to the grid by controlling the frequency<br>
converter so as to generate reactive current also in the event of a grid voltage<br>
drop.<br>
According to a first aspect of the invention, in the event of a substantial grid<br>
voltage drop, the amount of reactive current to be supplied to the grid is<br>
controlled by controlling the frequency converter accordingly so as to generate<br>
reactive current. Depending on the type of generator used, either the<br>
generator-side power converter or the grid-side power converter or both<br>
power converters of the frequency converter is/are controlled. The generatorside<br>
power converter of a frequency converter often is referred to as a AC/DC<br>
converter or rectifier, while the grid-side power converter is referred to as a<br>
DC/AC converter or inverter. In a frequency converter, the generator-side and<br>
grid-side power converters are connected by a DC link circuit comprising at<br>
least one capacitor.<br>
If a double fed or dual-powered asynchronous generator is used, in the event<br>
of a substantial .grid voltage drop, according to the invention at least one of<br>
the generator-side power converter and the grid-side power converter is<br>
controlled so as to generate reactive current necessary to support the grid. A<br>
double fed asynchronous machine is an induction generator having its stator<br>
and rotor windings driven by the grid. In case of disconnection of the stator<br>
windings from the grid, according to the invention the reactive current can.still<br>
be controlled in the event of a substantial grid voltage drop, in that the gridside<br>
power converter is controlled. In case of the generator being an<br>
asynchronous or synchronous machine, controlling the amount of reactive<br>
current to be supplied to the grid is performed by controlling the grid-side<br>
power converter so as to generate reactive current. If such a generator in the<br>
event of a substantial grid voltage drop is not in its operating state for<br>
generating power, i.e. the stator is disconnected from the grid, when e.g. the<br>
wind speed is less thari the cut-in or a minimum wind speed or exceeds the<br>
cut-off of a maximum wind speed, the amount of reactive current to be<br>
supplied to the grid is generated by controlling the grid-side power converter.<br>
Most preferably and typically, the reactive current in the frequency converter<br>
according to the invention is controlled by controlling the performance factor<br>
(cos <p however also other control mechanisms for phase shifting which are></p>
basically known to those skilled in the art can be used in accordance with the<br>
invention.<br>
Typically, the reactive current controlling step or at least one of the controlling<br>
steps is performed when, for a certain time period e.g. between a few<br>
milliseconds and a few seconds, the grid voltage is decreased up to at least<br>
about 40 %, more preferably 20 %, and, in particular, up to at least 15 % of<br>
its normal value, which in case of the medium high voltage grid is around 20<br>
kV. According to a further aspect of the invention, after e.g. such a grid<br>
voltage drop the reactive current controlling step or at least one of the<br>
controlling steps is terminated when, for a few seconds, the grid voltage is<br>
increased again up to at least about 70 %, more preferably 80 and, in<br>
particular, up to about 90 % of its normal value.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for<br>
operating a frequency converter of a generator in particular of a wind energy<br>
turbine under substantially normal grid condition (typically Â± 5-10 % deviation<br>
from the normal grid voltage) and with the generator not being in its operating<br>
state, wherein the frequency converter comprises a generator-side power<br>
converter, to be connected to the generator, a grid-side power converter to be<br>
connected to the voltage grid, and a DC link circuit for connecting the<br>
generator-side power converter to the grid-side power converter, the method<br>
comprising the step of controlling the amount of reactive current to be<br>
supplied to the grid by controlling the grid-side power converter.<br>
In accordance with this aspect of the invention, the amount of reactive current<br>
to be supplied to the grid, is controlled by controlling the grid-side power<br>
converter, when under normal grid conditions, the generator is not in its<br>
operating state, i.e. with its stator being disconnected from the grid as<br>
referred to before. The generator can be a asynchronous machine, a double<br>
fed asynchronous machine, or a synchronous machine. The control of the<br>
frequency converter can be supervised by the utility or a power management<br>
control of the generator or a group of generators at least one of which is<br>
bperatively connected to the grid.<br>
According to a further aspect, the present invention provides a wind energy<br>
turbine for generating power to be supplied to a grid, comprising<br>
a rotor,<br>
a generator operatively connected to the rotor,<br>
a frequency converter electrically connectable to the generator and the<br>
grid and comprising a generator-side power converter operatively<br>
connectable to the generator, a grid-side power converter operatively<br>
connectable to the grid, and a DC link circuit for connecting the<br>
generator-side power converter to the grid-side power converter, and<br>
a control unit for controlling the frequency converter for generating<br>
reactive current to be supplied to the grid,<br>
wherein in the event of a substantial grid voltage drop, the control unit<br>
controls the frequency converter for controlling the amount of reactive<br>
current to supplied to the grid so as to generate reactive current.<br>
Finally, in a last aspect of the invention there is provided a wind energy turbine<br>
for generating power to be supplied to a grid, comprising<br>
a rotor,<br>
a generator operatively connected to the rotor,<br>
a frequency converter electrically connectable to the generator and the<br>
grid and comprising a generator-side power converter operatively<br>
connectable to the generator, a grid-side power converter operatively<br>
connectable to the grid, and a DC link circuit for connecting the<br>
generator-side power converter to the grid-side power converter, and<br>
a control unit for controlling the frequency converter for generating<br>
reactive current to be supplied to the grid,<br>
wherein under normal grid condition but with the generator not in its<br>
operating state, the control unit controlled the grid-side power converter<br>
of the frequency converter for controlling the amount of reactive current<br>
to be supplied to the grid.<br>

A full and enabling disclosure of the present invention, including the best mode<br>
thereof, to one of ordinary skill in the art, is set forth more particularly in the<br>
reminder of the specification, including reference to the accompanying<br>
drawings in which<br>

controlling the amount of reactive power in the event of a substantial<br>
grid voltage drop with or without the generator being disconnected<br>

Fig. 2 shows an embodiment of the invention similar to that of Fig. 1 with<br>
the asynchronous generator being replaced by a permanently excited<br>
synchronous generator, and<br>
Fig. 3 shows an embodiment of the invention similar to that of Fig. 2 with<br>
the permanently excited synchronous generator being replaced by an<br>
electrically excited synchronous generator.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
In Fig. 1, the primary components of a wind energy turbine 10 for converting<br>
mechanical energy into electrical energy are shown. According to the drawing,<br>
a rotor 12 of the wind energy turbine 10 is mechanically connected to an<br>
asynchronous generator 14 (i.e., induction generator), through a gearbox 16.<br>
The asynchronous generator converts rotational mechanical energy into<br>
electrical energy which is supplied to a power distribution grid 18. For doing<br>
so, the asynchronous generator typically includes a stator 20 having a threephase<br>
winding (not shown) and connected to the power distribution grid 18.<br>
Moreover, the asynchronous generator 14 also includes a rotor 22 provided<br>
with a three-phase winding (not shown) which !s connected to a short circuit<br>
24 (also referred to as a crowbar).<br>
As is commonly known, the rotor winding is excited by a frequency converter<br>
26, which in turn is connected to the power distribution grid 18. The design of<br>
the frequency converter 26 is generally known to those skilled in the art. The<br>
frequency converter 26 Includes a grid-side power converter 28 (DC/AC<br>
converter or inverter) connected to the power distribution grid 18, a DC link<br>
circuit 30, and a generator-side power converter 32 (AC/DC converter or<br>
rectifier) connected to the rotor winding. At the input and at the output of the<br>
frequency converter 26, filter circuits 34,36 are provided. Switches 37,39 are<br>
provided for connecting and disconnecting the stator and rotor to and from the<br>
grid, respectively.<br>
The frequency converter 26 is controlled by a control unit 38, which receives<br>
nominal rating parameters (e.g. operational conditions) from the wind energy<br>
turbine (not shown), as well as grid voltage Ugrid and grid current IBI1d. These<br>
input parameters received by the control unit 38 are generally known to those<br>
skilled in the art with respect to variable speed wind energy turbines.<br>
Although in Rg. 1 specific electronic switches are shown as part of the gridside<br>
and generator-side power converters 28,32, respectively, any type of selfcommunicating<br>
or externally controlled commutating electronic element like a<br>
thyristor, transistor, IGBT, diode or the like can be used. Moreover, although<br>
in Fig. 1 the generator 14 is shown as build as a double fed asynchronous<br>
machine, other types of generators like asynchronous or synchronous machine<br>
(the latter being electrically or permanently excited) can be used in<br>
accordance with the invention for controlling reactive current in case of a<br>
substantial grid voltage drop and/or in case of the generator not being in its<br>
operating state due to a temporarily disconnection from the grid 18.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, control of the control unit 38 is supervised by a turbine<br>
controller 40 which, in this embodiment, is controlled by a wind park energy<br>
- 8 -<br>
management 42 controlling a plurality of (not shown) turbine controllers 40<br>
and controlled by the utility 44. In the event that the wind energy turbine 10 is<br>
not part of a wind energy park comprising a plurality of wind energy turbines,<br>
the utility 44 directly controls the turbine controller 40.<br>
Presently, grids are stabilized by conventional power plants. Upon occurrence<br>
of a brief short circuit or disturbance, e.g. an undeslred disconnection within<br>
the grid, the grid' voltage undergoes a brief drop, and after the disturbance has<br>
been terminated, the power plants generally increase the voltage again.<br>
Presently, more nominal power output of wind energy plants is provided and<br>
the number of the wind energy plants is rapidly increasing. Thus, today's large<br>
wind parks reach the power output of small conventional power plants. To<br>
achieve grid stability, future wind energy plants must have the same<br>
properties as conventional power plants in the event of disturbances of the<br>
grid. In the event of a grid voltage drop not only real power has to be<br>
generated for supporting the grid 18 but also reactive current or power has to<br>
be generated in order to support the disturbed grid which due to its<br>
impedances and, in particular, due to the inductors represented by the wiring<br>
of the grid needs some reactive power.<br>
According to the invention, in the event that a detector 46 for the grid voltage<br>
and/or the grid current senses a grid distortion (i.e. a substantial grid voltage<br>
drop), via the turbine controller 40 and/or the control unit 38 the frequency<br>
converter 26 is controlled so as to provide the amount of reactive current<br>
necessary to support the disturbed grid. The reactive current can be generated<br>
and controlled by at least one of the grid-side power converter 28 and the<br>
generator-side power converter 32. If switch 37 is open, i.e. if the generator<br>
14 is not in its operating state, and if the grid 18 is disturbed, reactive current<br>
can be generated by controlling the grid-side power converter 28 only. For<br>
controlling the reactive current under the circumstances mentioned above, for<br>
example the performance factor of the power converters 28,32 of the<br>
frequency converter 26 can be controlled.<br>
Moreover, by the circuitry and system shown in Fig. 1, also under normal grid<br>
conditions and with the generator 14 being disconnected from the grid 18<br>
(switch 37 opened), reactive current can be generated to be supplied to the<br>
grid 18. In the instant embodiment this can be performed by controlling the<br>
grid-side power converter 28.<br>
As being evident from the above, in one aspect of the invention, through the<br>
frequency converter 26 reactive power can be supplied to the grid 18 for<br>
supporting the same. The amount of reactive power supply will be increased.<br>
This causes an increased voltage supply from, the wind energy turbine 10<br>
which is desirable in case of a grid voltage drop. According to the invention,<br>
reactive power Is supplied by operating the frequency converter 26, i.e. by<br>
operating at least one of its power converters 28 and 32. Both converters can<br>
create reactive power which can be controlled by the control unit 38 and/or<br>
the turbine controller 40.<br>
One possibility for controlling the amount of reactive power generated by the<br>
wind energy turbine 10 and supplied to the grid 18 is to measure the grid<br>
voltage in order to influence the control unit 38 in such a way that the<br>
generator 14 will be over excited. This causes the generator 14 to supply<br>
reactive power. This possibility is applicable for double fed asynchronous<br>
machines by controlling the generator-side power converter 32 of the<br>
frequency converter 26. As an alternative or in addition thereto, reactive<br>
power can be generated also by controlling the grid-side power converter 28.<br>
In this case, the grid-side power converter 28 delivers reactive power to the<br>
grid 18. Even if the stator of the generator 14 is not connected to the grid 18,<br>
the grid-side power converter 28 is able to deliver reactive power in both the<br>
over or under excited operating mode of the generator 14.<br>
A further aspect of the invention is related to reactive power control in normal<br>
grid conditions. In this case the grid-side power converter 28 is able to deliver<br>
reactive power in both the over or under excited operating mode of the<br>
generator 14 when the stator of the generator 14 is not connected to the grid<br>
18 and when the wind energy turbine 10 delivers not real power.<br>
For all the above-mentioned aspects, the reference of reactive power can be<br>
calculated inside the converter control unit 38 or inside the turbine controller<br>
40. Also it is possible to calculate the reference of reactive power by another<br>
unit, for example the wind park energy management 42. This may also<br>
comprise the option of external units calculating the reference of reactive<br>
power, i.e. for example the utility 44.<br>
Further embodiments of the invention are shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. In these<br>
Figures for parts similar or identical to the parts of Fig. 1, the same reference<br>
numerals provided with a prime or double prime are used.<br>
The distinguishing feature of the wind energy turbine 10' according to Fig. 2<br>
over that of Fig. 1 relates to the type of generator 14' used. However, the<br>
control of the generation of reactive current in the frequency converter 26'<br>
basically is the same. This is also true for the embodiment of Fig. 3 in which<br>
the synchronous generator 14' of the embodiment of Fig. 2 is replaced by a<br>
electrically excited synchronous generator 14" driven by an exciting circuitry<br>
48" controlled by the turbine controller 40" depending beside others from the<br>
rotational speed of the rotor 12".<br>
More specifically, in the embodiments of Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, reactive current in<br>
the event of a grid voltage drop is generated by controlling the grid-side power<br>
converter 28 of the frequency converter 26.<br>
In connection with the embodiment of Fig. 1 also the case is taken into<br>
consideration that the grid 18 Is under substantially normal condition and that<br>
the generator 14 is disconnected from the grid by means of the switch 37<br>
which is opened. In a synchronous generator 14' and 14" as shown in Fig. 2<br>
and Fig. 3, disconnection of the generator from the grid is performed by<br>
leaving open the electronic switches of the generator-side power converter 32.<br>
In this situation the grid-side power converter 28 is still connected to the grid<br>
18 since the switch 37' and 37", respectively, is still closed. Accordingly,<br>
reactive current can be generated by controlling the grid-side power converter<br>
28 so as to supply reactive current to the grid 18.<br>
Although the invention has been described and explained.with reference to<br>
specific Illustrative embodiments thereof, it is not intended that the invention<br>
be limited to those illustrative embodiments. Those skilled in the art will<br>
