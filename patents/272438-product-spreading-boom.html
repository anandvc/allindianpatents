C. E. SITCH<br>
Managing Director - UK Translation Division<br>
For and on behalf of RWS Group Ltd<br><br>
The present invention relates to the overall technical field of the spreading of products, and in particular to the field of the spraying of treatment products of the plant-protection type.<br>
The invention relates to a product-spray boom (boom hereinafter) for a product-spreading agricultural implement (agricultural implement hereinafter), which spray boom is equipped with a suspension device via which it is intended to be connected to the chassis of the agricultural implement, the said suspension device comprising a connecting rod which connects the said boom to the said chassis, this connecting rod being connected to the said chassis via a first articulation, the axis of which is directed in the direction of forward travel during work, and to the boom by means of a second articulation, the axis of which is likewise directed in the direction of forward travel during work, the said suspension device comprising springs intended to act against the pivoting of the boom about the second articulation, and dampers intended to damp the said pivoting of the boom about the said second articulation.<br>
A suspension device such as this fitted to a spray boom is disclosed in document FR 2 813 212. That document of the prior art actually describes a suspension device which comprises a connecting rod connecting the boom to the chassis of a product-spreading agricultural implement of the agricultural sprayer type. This connecting rod is connected to the chassis by means of a first articulation, the axis of which is directed in the direction of forward travel during work, and to the boom by means of a second articulation, the axis of which likewise is directed in the direction of forward travel during work. This known suspension device also comprises springs to act against the pivoting of the boom about the second articulation, and dampers intended to damp this movement of the boom about this second articulation. These springs and these dampers extend between the boom and a cross bar which is secured to the connecting rod during work by means of a first hydraulic cylinder. A second hydraulic cylinder is also provided between the chassis and the connecting rod, which during work makes it possible either to prevent the connecting rod from pivoting about the first articulation or to damp such pivoting movements.<br>
2<br><br>
With a suspension device such as this, the behavior of the boom is not optimal over uneven or sloping land. This is because in the configuration with one degree of freedom (pivoting about the first articulation prevented by the second hydraulic cylinder), when traveling over land that is very rutted and bumpy, the operator is forced to correct the orientation of the boom by hand using the first hydraulic cylinder which for this purpose is known as the "cross-fall cylinder" if the slope of the land under the wheels of the agricultural sprayer or the vehicle on which it is mounted does not correspond to the slope of the land. In the configuration with two degrees of freedom (the possibility of pivoting about the first articulation), the boom, under the effect of gravity, is incapable of positioning itself parallel to the slope of the land when the agricultural sprayer or the vehicle on which it is mounted is operating on a cross-fall slope.<br>
The object of the present invention is to improve this known suspension device and to propose a suspension device that makes it possible to improve the behavior of the boom and in particular to direct it appropriately irrespective of the condition and lie of the ground over which the agricultural implement or the vehicle on which it is mounted is traveling.<br>
To this end, one important feature of the invention is that the said suspension device additionally comprises additional springs acting between the boom and the chassis of the agricultural implement and that the center of gravity of the boom lies substantially in the vicinity of the second articulation and preferably somewhat below the second articulation.<br>
These additional springs automatically reorientate the boom regardless of the condition and lie of the ground over which the agricultural implement or the vehicle on which it is mounted will travel, and irrespective of the conditions of use. Oscillations resulting from ruts and bumps in the land are also rapidly damped out.<br>
3<br><br>
Other features and advantages of the invention will become clear from the claims and from the description which will follow of a non-limiting exemplary embodiment of the invention given with reference to the attached drawings in which;<br>
Figure 1 depicts an overview of an agricultural implement equipped with a boom fitted with a suspension device according to the invention,<br>
Figure 2 shows a rear view of the said suspension device and of the boom when the agricultural implement is moving over flat land,<br>
Figure 3 shows a rear view of the said suspension device and of the boom when the agricultural implement is moving over land with a cross-fall slope.<br>
Figure 1 depicts an exemplary embodiment of a boom (1) for an agricultural implement (2) equipped with a suspension device (3) according to the invention. The purpose of the suspension device (3) is to suspend the boom (1) to the chassis (4) of the agricultural implement (2) such as a sprayer, for example, in particular allowing the said boom (1) to be correctly orientated to suit the lie of the land over which the agricultural implement (2) is traveling. This boom (1) is intended in particular to spread fertilizer, treatment products of the plant-protection type, or other types of product that need to be spread over the ground (S) or over crops, as uniformly as possible. To do that, the agricultural implement (2) is, during work, moved in a direction and sense of forward travel indicated by the arrow (A). The boom (1) is shown only partially in the figures.<br>
In the remainder of the description, the ideas of "front" and "rear", "in front of" and "behind" are defined with respect to the direction of forward travel (A) and the ideas of "right" and "left" are defined when viewing the agricultural implement (2) from behind in the said direction of forward travel (A).<br>
4<br><br>
As the agricultural implement (2) moves around in a field, the boom (1) is subjected to movements and to stresses. It is a particular role of the suspension device (3) to absorb and attenuate movements of the tractor to prevent them from being transmitted directly and in full to the boom (1) so that this boom can behave in the optimal way in the field.<br>
As can be seen in Figure 2 in particular, the suspension device (3) comprises a connecting rod (6) which connects the boom (1) to the chassis (4) of the agricultural implement (2). The connecting rod (6) is connected to the chassis (4) by means of a first articulation (7), the axis of which is substantially horizontal and substantially directed in the direction of forward travel (A) during work. The boom (1) for its part is connected to the connecting rod (6) by means of a second articulation (8), the axis of which is also substantially horizontal and also directed substantially in the direction of forward travel (A) during work. The suspension device (3) according to the invention is thus of the "pendular" type.<br>
In a known way, the said boom (1) has a central section (9) with, on each side thereof, an arm (1A, 1B) each made as one or more intermediate sections (10A, 10B) and an outermost section (not depicted), these sections (10A, 10B) being, in a known way, respectively joined to one another by means of articulations. Only some of the intermediate sections (10A, 10B) are depicted in Figures 1 and 2. The outermost sections are not depicted in the figures. Each section (9, 10A, 10B) is intended to carry spreading means such as spray nozzles for example in the case of an agricultural sprayer, for spreading products on the ground (S) or on the crops. The intermediate sections (10A, 10B) and the outermost sections are positioned substantially symmetrically with respect to the vertical mid-plane (11) of the boom (1). Thus, the center of gravity (28) of the boom (1) lies substantially in the vertical mid-plane (11).<br>
5<br><br>
During product-spreading work, the arms (1A, 1B) of the boom (1) are extended to cover a broad strip of land: the boom (1) thus extends transversely to the direction of forward travel (A) during work and substantially parallel to the ground (S).<br>
For transport, the arms (1A,1B) are folded in a known way so as to reduce the bulk of the boom (1) and, in particular, comply with the size allowed for travel on the public highway. The outermost section and the intermediate section(s) (10A, 10B) of each arm (1A, 1B) of the boom (1) are folded substantially vertically, or, respectively, unfolded substantially to the horizontal position, via a respective actuator (13A, 13B) and a respective elastic system (14A, 14B) about the articulations that connect them to one another. The actuators (13A, 13B) are, for example, hydraulic cylinder. Each actuator (13A, 13B) extends between the central section (9) and the respective adjacent intermediate section (10A, 10B). The corresponding outermost section and, if any, the additional intermediate section(s) (10A, 10B) are, for their part, folded and unfolded respectively by virtue of the corresponding elastic system (14A, 14B). Each elastic system (14A, 14B) for this purpose comprises a pulling member (15A, 15B) connected to a draw-spring (16A, 16B). At one of its ends, the spring (16A, 16B) is connected to the connecting rod (6) at a corresponding attachment point (17A, 17B). At its other end, the said spring (16A, 16B) is connected to a corresponding arm (1A, 1B) of the boom (1). The spring (16A, 16B) is connected to the corresponding pulling member (15A, 15B) which for its part acts on the respective additional intermediate section(s) (10A, 10B) and the respective outermost section. The prime function of the springs (16A, 16B) is to unfold and fold up this/these respective additional intermediate section(s) (10A, 10B) and the respective outermost section. The pulling member (15A, 15B) is preferably a cable.<br>
There is a tendency to use agricultural implements (2) of increasingly large working width and to operate at ever increasing speeds. The faster it travels, the greater are the risks that parts of the said agricultural implement (2) will be deformed or broken under the effect of the high stresses that can then be generated. The increase in work rates and sizes of the booms (1) necessitates a robust construction and a suitable<br>
6<br><br>
suspension device (3). The suspension device (3) for the boom (1) of an agricultural implement (2) is therefore a key component in guaranteeing good distribution of the product that is to be spread and in preventing any damage which would lead to loss of time and maintenance and repair costs that could be great.<br>
In order to keep the boom (1) substantially parallel to the ground, the suspension device (3) uses elastic systems (14A, 14B), and especially the springs (16A, 16B) thereof, the second function of which springs is to act against the pivoting of the boom (1) about the second articulation (8) by absorbing and restoring the energy giving the boom (1) an oscillatory movement.<br>
The suspension device (3) also comprises dampers (18A, 18B) extending between the central section (9) and the connecting rod (6) and which make it possible to damp the movements of the boom (1) about the second articulation (8). The dampers (18A, 18B) reduce the duration of the oscillations, braking the amplitude of these oscillations, they dissipate energy. The dampers (18A, 18B) eliminate the oscillatory movement introduced by the springs (16A, 16B).<br>
As stated earlier, each spring (16A, 16B) is attached to the connecting rod (6) by means of an attachment point (17A, 17B). This attachment point (17A, 17B) preferably lies near the second articulation (8) and substantially in the vicinity of the vertical mid-plane of the connecting rod (6) without, however, coinciding with the said second articulation (8) so that the springs (16A, 16B) act on the said second articulation (8) with a certain lever arm. The springs (16A, 16B) advantageously extend substantially horizontally and substantially at right angles to the direction of forward travel (A). The springs (16A, 16B) are advantageously positioned in such a way that their respective line of action passes close to the second articulation (8). These springs (16A, 16B) act on the connecting rod (6) with substantially equal and opposite forces. The position of the springs (16A, 16B) is symmetric with respect to the vertical mid-plane (11) of the boom (1). They allow the 'boom (1) to be automatically re-centered with respect to the second articulation (8) because they act<br>
7<br><br>
against the pivoting of the boom (1) about the said second articulation (8). These springs (16A/ 16B) are relatively stiff because they have also to pull on the corresponding additional intermediate section(s) (10) and the corresponding outermost section in order to stiffen them during work. It therefore follows that the degree of freedom, in pivoting, of the boom (1) about the second articulation (8) is advantageously relatively limited, the springs (16A, 16B) permit small-amplitude movements.<br>
As stated earlier, the dampers (18A, 18B) are positioned between the boom (1), and more specifically the central section (9) thereof, and the connecting rod (6). To this end, the connecting rod (6) comprises, on each side of its mid-plane, a flange (19A, 19B) to the end of which the corresponding damper (18A, 18B) is attached. The said mid-plane of the connecting rod (6) being substantially coincident with the mid-plane (11) of the boom (1) when the agricultural implement (2) is on horizontal land. The two flanges (19A, 19B) are symmetric. Thus, the dampers (18A, 18B) are fitted substantially symmetrically with respect to the mid-plane (11) of the boom (1). In addition, they are fitted in such a way as to converge upward to a point (P1) located a certain distance above the second articulation (8), preferably even above the first articulation (7). The flanges (19A, 19B) are slightly inclined upward so that their point of convergence is positioned substantially in the said mid-plane of the connecting rod (6). Each flange (19A, 19B) is intended to slide on a part (4A, 4B) of the chassis (4) with a certain amount of friction as said connecting rod (6) pivots about the first articulation (7).<br>
The pivoting movements about the first articulation (7) are, for their part, damped by friction of the connecting rod (6) against the chassis (4). To this end, the end of each flange (19A, 19B) which is in contact with the chassis (4) is fitted with friction shoes (20A, 20B) via which the said flange (19A, 19B) rubs against the corresponding part (4A, 4B) of the chassis (4). The pivoting about the first articulation (7) is thus damped by the damping device (19A-4A, 19B-4B). This damping device (19A-4A, 19B-4B) acts between the connecting rod (6) and the chassis (4).<br>
8<br><br>
According to an important feature of the invention, the suspension device (3) also comprises additional springs (21A, 21B) acting between the boom (1) and the chassis (4). The additional springs (21A, 21B) extend substantially symmetrically on each side of the mid-plane (11) of the said boom (1). As can be seen in the figures, an additional spring (21A, 21B) extends on each side of the said mid-plane (11). There are two of these additional springs (21A, 21B). The springs (16A, 16B) also extend substantially symmetrically on each side of the vertical mid-plane (11). Each spring (16A, 16B) is connected to one of the respective arms (1A, 1B) of the boom (1). The center of gravity (28) of the boom (1) is positioned substantially on the vertical mid-plane (11). Further, it lies substantially in the vicinity of the second articulation (8) and preferably somewhat below the latter.<br>
Because of the existence of these additional springs (21A, 21B) the pendular behavior of the boom (1) is improved, this boom thus orientating itself more quickly in slopes and being better isolated from the oscillatory movements of the tractor, irrespective of the lie of the ground (S) over which the agricultural implement (2) is traveling and irrespective of the conditions under which it is being used. This then keeps the boom (1) almost always parallel to the ground (S) regardless of the lie of the land and of the speed of forward travel. During spreading work, the operator can thus cover land with a cross-fall slope in all directions without having to adjust the attitude of the boom (1), even if this land is deeply rutted.<br>
The additional springs (21 A, 21B) are advantageously positioned lower down than the first articulation (7) and extend substantially symmetrically with respect to the first articulation (7), acting with a certain lever arm with respect to this first articulation (7). The additional springs (21A, 21B) are essentially upright when viewed in the direction of forward travel (A) during work. In the example depicted, they are positioned between the boom (1) and a corresponding extension (22A, 22B) of the chassis (4). In actual fact, the said additional springs (21A, 21B) are advantageously mounted in such a way as to converge to a point (P2) (not depicted) located a significant distance below the surface of the ground (S). These additional<br>
9<br><br>
springs (21A, 21B) are advantageously tension springs. They also have great flexibility, that is to say that their characteristic is relatively flat. Their lengthwise deformation is significant because they are of low stiffness.<br>
Provision is also made for the user to be able to alter the force with which these additional springs (21A, 21B) act on the boom (1). For that, provision is made for the connection between each additional spring (21A, 21B) and the corresponding extension (22A, 22B) of the chassis (4) to be made using a screw/nut system (25A, 25B) that allows the said force to be adjusted. This adjustment makes it possible to alter the behavior of the boom (1) if necessary, but is also needed when the boom (1) is replaced by a boom of a different length (for example when substituting a 15-meter boom for a 12-meter boom). The force applied by the additional springs (21A, 21B) can be adjusted on the boom (1).<br>
It is also advantageous to be able to adjust the force applied by the springs (16A, 16B). This adjustment is performed by shifting the point of attachment (17A, 17B) of each spring (16A, 16B) to the connecting rod (6). For this purpose the latter has several possible attachment points. One possible alternative option might be to provide the attachment points (17A, 17B) on a part capable of translational movement along the said connecting rod (6). Thus, the distance between the point of attachment (17A, 17B) of each spring (16A, 16B) and the second articulation (8) is adjustable. Such adjustment makes it possible to adapt the suspension device (3) to suit the land; if the land is very bumpy and rutted then the attachment point (17A, 17B) will be close to the second articulation (8). Provision may also advantageously be made for the position of the connecting points of the dampers (18A, 18B) to be adjustable so as to adapt the damping to suit the working conditions. The flanges (19A, 19B) of the connecting rod (6) therefore also have several possible connecting points for the said dampers (18A, 18B). It is thus possible to alter the sensitivity of the suspension device (3) and hence the dynamic response of the boom (1).<br>
10<br><br>
In the exemplary embodiment depicted, the said agricultural implement (2) is of the tractor-mounted sprayer type. Thus, the full weight of the said agricultural implement (2) is borne by the tractor. The chassis (4) of the agricultural implement (2) is produced in such a way as to be coupled to a three-point hitch belonging to the tractor. The agricultural implement (2) also comprises a tank (23) intended to contain a treatment liquid. From Figure 1 it can be seen that the said tank (23) is supported by the chassis (4). In a known way, the agricultural implement (2) further comprises means (not depicted) of pumping treatment liquid contained in the said tank (23) to dispatch it under pressure to the said spray nozzles. The said treatment liquid is thus deposited in fine droplets on the plants or on the ground (S) that are/is to be treated. As such nozzles are widely known, they have not been depicted in the figures and will not be described further.<br>
In a way that is also known, the chassis (4) is produced in such a way that the boom (1) can be moved heightwise relative to the ground (S). In the exemplary embodiment, the chassis (4) is, in a known way, made in two parts (26, 27): a carriage (26) to which the boom (1) is connected by means of the suspension device (3), and a frame (27) intended to be connected to the tractor. The carriage (26) can be moved in translational motion on the frame (27) under the action of actuating means that are also known but have not been depicted: manual winch, hydraulic cylinder, etc. Thus, the spraying height can be selected to suit the working conditions, particularly tailoring it to suit the size of plants to treat.<br>
If the agricultural implement (2) is traveling over flat and not very uneven land as depicted in Figure 2, the chassis (4) is not subjected to great oscillatory movements and the boom (1) is relatively stable and remains substantially parallel to the ground (S). The elastic systems (14A, 14B) exert equal and opposite forces on the connecting rod (6) which is therefore substantially vertical. The additional springs (21A, 21B) for their part likewise apply equal and opposite forces to the boom (1). The boom (1) thus remains a constant distance from the ground (S) and therefore from the plants to be treated.<br>
11<br><br>
However, in general, during spreading work, the agricultural implement (2) is subjected to a great deal of movement and vibration which could be passed on to the boom (1) in the form of various movements liable to disrupt the correct distribution of the products that are to be spread: vertical movements which would alter the height of the spreading means fixed to the said boom (1) and horizontal fore and aft movements. It is the vertical movements that are the most troublesome because they alter the area over which the products sprayed onto the ground (S) are spread and lead sometimes to under-application and sometimes to over-application of product.<br>
The suspension device (3) of the invention has to filter out or, at the very least, highly attenuate the transmission of these detrimental movements to the bar (1). During the travels of the agricultural implement (2) over the fields to spread a product, its boom (1) is almost always subjected to a combination of the two movements described hereinabove. When traveling at high speed, these movements are further accentuated. The suspension device (3) for this reason comprises, in addition to the two dampers (18A, 18B), an additional damper (24) fitted between the chassis (4) and the boom (1). This additional damper (24) is able to damp out movements of the boom (1) essentially about the first articulation (7).<br>
When the agricultural implement (2) has to work on uneven and/or bumpy ground, it is the tractor wheels (5) that encounter the unevennesses (bumps, holes, ruts, etc.) of the land. The sudden vertical movement of one of the said wheels (5) (downward when the wheel (5) falls into a recess or upward when the wheel drives over a bump) causes a sudden and lateral movement of the chassis (4). This vertical movement also results in a sudden and lateral movement of the first articulation (6). However, thanks to the pendular suspension, to the various springs (16A, 16B, 21A, 21B) and to the various dampers (18A, 18B, 19A-4A, 19B-4B, 24), the boom (1), which temporarily diverges from the horizontal, relatively quickly returns to its position parallel to the ground (S).<br>
12<br><br>
Figure 3 depicts the boom (1) and the suspension device (3) when the agricultural implement (2) is working on sloping land. Here again, under the combined effect of the pendular suspension, of the various springs (16A, 16B, 21A, 21B) and of the various dampers (18A, 18B, 19A-4A, 19B-4B, 24), the boom (1) automatically adopts a position substantially parallel to the surface of the ground (S) and its behavior is similar to that described above if this land with a cross-fall slope additionally has unevennesses (bumps, recesses, ruts, etc.).<br>
The suspension device (3) according to the invention that has just been described is just as suited to work on flat land as it is to work on land with a cross-fall slope, and this is true regardless of the lie of the surface of the ground (S). Specifically, the boom (1) is kept substantially parallel to the ground (S) and the sharp oscillations to which the chassis (3) may be subjected during work are filtered out and highly attenuated regardless of the conditions of use.<br>
The invention also relates to a product-spreading agricultural implement of the trailed or self-propelled type comprising a product-spreading boom (1) according to the invention. When the agricultural implement (2) is mounted on a tractor or is of the self-propelled type, the said tractor or the said self-propelled device is denoted by (4). When the agricultural implement (2) is trailed by a tractor and runs along the ground (S) using its own rolling chassis, it is the said rolling chassis that is denoted by (4).<br>
The invention applies more specifically to agricultural sprayers but may also be applied to fertilizer spreaders or the like.<br>
It is quite clear that the invention is not restricted to the embodiment described hereinabove and depicted in the attached drawings. Modifications can still be made, particularly as regards the composition or number of the various elements or by substituting technical equivalents without thereby departing from the field of protection as defined by the claims which follow.<br>
