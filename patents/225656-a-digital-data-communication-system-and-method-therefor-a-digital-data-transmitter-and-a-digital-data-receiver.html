Application No. Hei 11-107209 filed on April 14, 1999,<br>
including specification, claims, drawings and abstract is<br>

BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a digital data communication system and<br>
method therefor, a digital data transmitter and a digital data receiver, more<br>
specifically to communications of self-descriptive data.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
Nowadays, a communication method using the<br>
internet is known as two-way data communications among<br>
computers. The principle of the method will be briefly<br>
described hereunder. A plurality of hyper text markup<br>
language (hereinafter referred to as HTML) files linked<br>
with one another are stored into a world wide web<br>
(hereinafter referred to as WWW) server which is<br>
connected to the internet. A demand for transmitting the<br>
HTML files stored in the WWW server is sent thereto from<br>
a gathering information computer which is connected to<br>
the internet. The WWW server transmits whole or a part<br>
of the HTML files to the gathering computer in response<br>
to the demand. As a result, data linked with one another<br>
and stored in the WWW server can be transferred.<br>
Data communication services using satellite<br>
broadcasting, on the other hand, are known as one-way<br>
data communications. In satellite broadcasting, data are<br>
transmitted through a moving picture experts group 2<br>
(hereinafter referred to as MPEG 2) system standard used<br>
for data transmission which has a relatively higher<br>
flexibility than the other two standards in the MPEG 2,<br>
such as MPEG 2 video standard used for video data and<br>
MPEG 2 audio standard used for audio data, out of these<br>
three MPEG 2 standards.<br>
In order to transmit HTML files to the<br>
receivers by using satellite broadcasting, a demand for<br>
transmitting desired HTML file(s) need to be sent to the<br>
transmitter.<br>
To avoid sending the demand, methods described<br>
hereunder are employed in actual data communications<br>
protocols such as BITCAST and ADAMS (TV-Asahi data and<br>
multimedia service). A plurality of files linked with<br>
one another are transmitted as one unitized file by the<br>
transmitter. In the receiver, all the files are stored<br>
in a storage device like a hard disk by sequentially<br>
storing each of the files therein. Further, the<br>
specified file(s) is displayed in response to operation<br>
of the user by browser software installed in the<br>
receiver. The browser software performs reference<br>
operations by specifying the name of a file(s) stored in<br>
a hard disk when there is HTML tag(s) requiring reference<br>
of other file(s) in the specified file(s) (details of the<br>
technology is disclosed in an article entitled "Special<br>
Report from state-of-the-art technology; The Whole Aspect<br>
of the Next Generation Digital Television", published by<br>
Nikkei Business Publications, Inc.)<br>
In this method, however, all the files must be<br>
stored in the hard disk as well as storing information<br>
needed to manage the directory. In this way, a certain<br>
capability for storing this information is required in<br>
the receiver, and the receiver can not display a desired<br>
file(s) until its retrieval is completed. Further, a<br>
number of processing steps need to be performed by the<br>
receiving computer's central processing unit (CPU) for<br>
retrieving the desired file(s) from the stored files.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

The system 1 shown in Fig. 1 comprises a transmitter 3<br>
and a receiver 11.<br>
The transmitter 3 includes file storing means 7<br>
and transmission means 5. The file storing means 7<br>
stores a plurality of files comprising self-descriptive<br>
data. A part of the files include reference commands<br>
for referring another files. Identifiers of the files<br>
stored in the file storing means 7 consist of a series of<br>
characters which may directly be recognized with<br>
selecting means 15 in the receiver 11. The transmission<br>
means 5 repeatedly transmits the files with the<br>
identifiers according to a protocol after packetizing<br>
them.<br>
The receiver 11 comprises receiving means 14,<br>
selecting means 15, display data generating means 19, and<br>
selecting conditions variation means 17. The receiving<br>
means 14 receives the packets thus transmitted. The<br>
selecting means 15 selects only packets having selective<br>
identifiers out of the received packets in accordance<br>
with a selecting condition. The display data generating<br>
means 19 generates display data in accordance with self-<br>
descriptive data included in the selected packets.<br>
Further, the selecting conditions variation means 17<br>
varies the selecting condition so as to obtain selected<br>

self-descriptive data. The selecting conditions<br>
variation means 17 also varies the selecting condition in<br>
the selecting means 15 so as to obtain selected file(s) *<br>

1-1. Outline of satellite broadcasting<br>
One example of applying the present invention<br>
to satellite broadcasting will be described herein. The<br>
present invention, however, may also be applied to other<br>
broadcasting methods such as terrestrial broadcasting,<br>
wire broadcasting such as cable television and the like<br>
as long as packetized data are transmitted.<br>
1-1-1. State of sending radio waves in<br>
satellite broadcasting<br>
Fig. 2 shows a simplified conceptual view<br>
showing a state of sending radio waves in satellite<br>
broadcasting. Radio waves from a ground station 1002 are<br>
sent to a plurality of ground receivers (not shown)<br>
through a broadcasting satellite 1004. The broadcasting<br>
satellite 1004 sends out a plural number of transport<br>
streams 1010, 1020, 1030. Each transport stream is<br>
distinguished from the others by its frequency, plane of<br>
polarization and other factors (well known in the art).<br>
A plurality of services (analogous to channels<br>
in terrestrial broadcasting) 1011, 1012, 1013, and 1014<br>
being packetized are multiplexed in the transport stream<br>
1010 under a time-sharing manner. Similarly, services<br>
1021, 1022, 1023 and 1024, and services 1031, 1032, 1033<br>
and 1034 are multiplexed respectively in the transport<br>
streams 1020 and 1030. Various control data representing<br>
service information, the present time, and the like,<br>
together are sent out to each of the transport streams in<br>
addition to the packetized data (including video data and<br>
audio data). While, Fig. 2 shows only three transport<br>
streams, many more transport streams may be sent out.<br>
Furthermore, while Fig. 2 shows a total of four services<br>
multiplexed in each transport stream, in actuality many<br>
more services may be multiplexed therein.<br>
1-1-2. Outline of transmitter<br>
Fig. 3 is a schematic illustration of a<br>
transmitter for generating and transmitting the transport<br>
streams described above. While Fig. 3 shows only the<br>
transport stream 1010 for simplicity, other transport<br>
streams 1020, 1030 are generated thereby in the same<br>
manner.<br>
Video/audio data of the service 1011 are stored<br>
in a data storing unit 171. These data are compressed by<br>
an encoder 181, and are provided to a multiplexer 160.<br>
Similarly, video/audio data of the services 1012 and 1013<br>
are stored respectively in data storage unit 172 and 173.<br>
Video data for the services are compressed under the MPEG<br>
2 video standard, and audio data are compressed under the<br>
MPEG 2 audio standard. The data so compressed are<br>
provided to the multiplexer 160.<br>
In another data storage unit 174, HTML data<br>
used for the service 1014 is stored therein. The data<br>
are converted into modules having object headers by a<br>
data converter 184 in accordance with the MPEG 2 system<br>
standard. Module identification (module_id) are assigned<br>
to each of the modules. Details of the assignment will<br>
be described later.<br>
A control data generator 180 generates control<br>
data for multiplexing the packetized data,<br>
the control data for displaying program information, the<br>
control data representing the present time and other such<br>
data. The control data for multiplexing is assigned for<br>
properly recognizing video/audio data in plural services<br>
which are packetized and multiplexed under a time sharing<br>
manner.<br>
The multiplexer 160 outputs a plurality of<br>
packets under a time sharing manner, each consisting of<br>
packetized data having a fixed length as a result of<br>
carrying out packetization of the data provided from the<br>
control data generator 180, the encoder 181 through the<br>
encoder 183, and that from the data converter 184, as the<br>
transport stream 1010.<br>
Further, the multiplexer 160 assigns individual<br>
module_ids to section headers of all the packets when the<br>
data from the data converter 184 is packetized. In this<br>
embodiment, the last four digits of a packet are assigned<br>
a table_id_extension region (field) by using the first<br>
four digits thereof as a PID because the module<br>
identifiers consist of directory_id and filetid for<br>
identifying module (a total of eight digits) as described<br>
later.<br>
Thus, the packets comprising each file can<br>
definitely be specified without further consideration in<br>
the receiver by distinguishing them using the PID and the<br>
table_id_extension.<br>
A modulator 164 outputs the packets being<br>
provided and modulated thereby as a transport stream.<br>
The transport stream thus outputted is broadcasted to the<br>
audience.<br>
1-1-3. Structure of transport stream<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, services 1011, 1012 and<br>
1013, each including video data 81V, 82V and 83V, and<br>
audio data 81A, 82A and 83A respectively, service 1014,<br>
including HTML or imaging data 84 and a correspondence<br>
table 109 are multiplexed in the transport stream 1010<br>
generated by the transmitter shown in Fig. 3. Details of<br>
the correspondence table 109 will be described later.<br>
In addition, control data NIT 100, program<br>
allocation table (PAT) 101, and program map table (PMT)<br>
111 through PMT 114 for multiplexing the packetized data<br>
are multiplexed therein. The data corresponding to the.<br>
services 1011, 1012, 1013 and 1014 thus multiplexed can<br>
be separated by using these control data as described<br>
later. Control data EIT 121 through EIT 124, each<br>
representing program information, and control data<br>
representing the present time TDT 105, are also<br>
multiplexed therein. Other control data such as<br>
scrambling information and others are multiplexed therein<br>
even though these are not illustrated in the figures..<br>
The control data PMT 111, PMT 112, PMT 113 and PMT 114,<br>
and control data EIT 121, EIT 122, EIT 123 and EIT 124 are<br>
the control data for the services 1011, 1012, 1013 and 1014<br>
respectively.<br>
Packetization of the control data, the video data, the<br>
audio data, HTML data and the correspondence table is carried<br>
out in the sequence of a line 18a shown in Fig. 4. In other<br>
words, packetization of these data is carried out by the<br>
following sequence: the control data NIT, PAT, PMTs, EITs,<br>
TDT, then the video data 81V, the audio data 81A, the video<br>
data 82V, the audio data 82A, the video data 8V, the audio<br>
data 83, and the HTML data 84 and the correspondence table<br>
109. Upon completing the packetization in the. first round,<br>
further rounds of packetization are,carried out repeatedly<br>
under the same sequence starting from the control data NIT<br>
(see line 18b). The packetization process is carried out<br>
under a certain rule being predetermined (not shown).<br>
A basic structure of the packetized data is shown in<br>
Fig. 5. Both the control data and the video/audio data being<br>
packetized have the structure as shown in Fig. 5. PIDs are<br>
assigned to the forefront of each packetized data. PIDs are<br>
the references which are uniquely assigned to each of the<br>
packetized data to distinguish each packetized data from<br>
other packetized data. The data content field shown in<br>
Fig. 6 packetized object data (e.g. the control data,<br>
video/audio data, HTML data and others).<br>
Contents of the control data PMT 111 for multiplexing<br>
the packetized data of service 1011 are shown in Fig. 6.<br>
PIDs of both the video data 81V and the audio data 81A of the<br>
service 1011 are stored in the PMT 1ll. Similar PIDs as to<br>
these data in the services 1012, 1013 are stored respectively<br>
to in control data PMT 112, PMT 113.<br>
As shown in Fig. 7, a PID and a module identifier<br>
(described later) of data 84 in the service 1014 are stored<br>
in the PMT 114.<br>
PIDs Of PMT 111, PMT 112, PMT 113 and PMT 114, each<br>
corresponding to the services 1011, 1012, 1013 and 1014, are<br>
stored in the control data PAT as shown in Fig. 8.<br>
Transmission specifications defined by their<br>
frequencies, planes of polarization and the like as to all<br>
the transport streams 1010 through 1040, and a list of the<br>
services multiplexed in each of the transport streams are<br>
described in the control data NIT as shown in Fig. 9. This<br>
allows the receiver to learn what kinds of services are<br>
included in each of the transport streams.<br>
1-1-4. Outline of receiver<br>
Functions of the receiver 11 shown in Fig. 1<br>
are outlined with reference to Fig. 10. In the receiver.<br>
11, a desired transport stream is selected by a tuner<br>
222, and data concerned with a desired service contained<br>
in the selected transport stream is separated therefrom<br>
with a transport decoder 226.<br>
Further, a micro processing unit (hereinafter<br>
referred to as MPU) 228 sets PIDs of video/audio data of<br>
the desired service into the transport decoder 226. In<br>
response to the setting, the transport decoder 226<br>
outputs the video/audio data of the desired service. The<br>
control data thus separated are provided to the MPU 228<br>
when PIDs of the control data are set into the transport<br>
decoder 226.<br>
Operations of the receiver 1 which currently<br>
receives the service 1033 contained in the transport<br>
stream 1030, and receives a command to switch it to<br>
another service 1012 included in the transport stream<br>
1010, will be described herein.<br>
The MPU 228 controls the transport decoder 226<br>
to obtain the control data NIT (i.e., by setting a PID of<br>
the control data NIT into the transport decoder 226).<br>
The description of the control data NIT tells that the<br>
service 1012 is multiplexed in the transport stream 1010<br>
(see Fig. 9). In response to the description, the MPU<br>
228 controls the tuner 222 to receive the transport<br>
stream 1010. PIDs of video and audio data in the desired<br>
service 1012 are obtained as a result of separating the<br>
control data PAT and PMT 112 by controlling the transport<br>
decoder 226 with the MPU 228. The MPU 228 controls the<br>
transport decoder 226 to output the video and the audio<br>
data of the desired service 1012 by setting filtering<br>
conditions (the conditions for performing filtering) to<br>
select these PIDs into the transport decoder 226.<br>
Switching of the received service is carried<br>
out as described above.<br>
The MPU 228, further controls the transport<br>
decoder 226 to obtain the control data EIT when a command<br>
for displaying a program schedule and program information<br>
is provided to the MPU 228. In addition, the MPU 228<br>
controls peripherals to display the program information<br>
and related information in accordance with the control<br>
data EIT thus obtained.<br>
1-2. First embodiment<br>
1-2-1. Transmitter<br>
Fig. 11 is a detailed block diagram<br>
illustrating a hardware structure of the transmitter 3<br>
shown in Fig. 3. The transmitter 3 in this embodiment is<br>
used for a digital broadcasting system compliant with<br>
MPEG 2 standard. Digital Storage Media Command and<br>
Control (hereinafter referred to as DSM-CC)<br>
specification, and Digital Video Broadcasting<br>
(hereinafter referred to as DVB) specification for Services<br>
Information (hereinafter referred to as DVB-SI). Definition<br>
of MPEG 2 standard is found in the international standards<br>
organization documents ISO/IEC 13818-1 and ISO/IEC 13818-2.<br>
The document ISO/IEC 13818-6 specifies the DSM-CC<br>
specification. Further, the document ETSI ETS 300 468 (which<br>
is similar to document of Association of Radio Industries and<br>
Businesses STD-B2 version 1.0 in Japan) defines the DVB-SI<br>
specification.<br>
The transmitter 3 is a satellite digital transmitter<br>
capable of transmitting HTML data together with video data<br>
and audio data under a multiplexed format. Fig. 11 shows the<br>
structureSwithin the transmitter 3 supporting the services<br>
1011 and 1014. The structures of services 1012 and 1013 (not<br>
shown) are similar to that of service 1011.<br>
The video data of the service 1011 is stored in a video<br>
data storage unit 311V. The video data are compressed with a<br>
video encoder 331. The video data thus compressed is<br>
provided to a first-in first-out (hereinafter referred to as<br>
FIFO) memory 342 as an elementary stream at a varied rate.<br>
The FIFO memory 342 outputs the elementary stream of video<br>
data to a packeting circuit 344 at a fixed rate.<br>
The packet circuit 344 segments the elementary<br>
stream of the video data into a plurality of packets<br>
each having a fixed length (e.g. 188 bytes), and<br>
writes the packets into a memory 352 as packetized elementary<br>
streams (hereinafter referred to as PES). PIDs are<br>
assigned to each of the PESs as they are written into<br>
memory 352.<br>
Similarly, audio data of the service 1011 is<br>
stored in an audio data storage unit 311A. The audio<br>
data are compressed with an audio encoder 332, and is<br>
provided to another FIFO memory 346. The compressed<br>
audio data are segmented into packets by packet circuit<br>
348. Each packet has a fixed length, and is written into<br>
another memory 354 with its own PID as described above<br>
for the video data.<br>
A packet multiplex controller 356 reads out<br>
PESs of both the video data and the audio data stored in<br>
the memories 352 and 354 in response to its encoding<br>
speed. Also, the controller 356 provides the PIDs<br>
assigned to the PESs of both the video data and the audio<br>
data to a PMT generating circuit 358. The PMT generating<br>
circuit 358 generates the control data PMT 111 as a<br>
result of receiving the PIDs. The assigned PIDs of both<br>
the video data and the audio data contained in the<br>
service are listed in the control data PMT. Both the<br>
PESs of the video and the audio data being read out from<br>
memory 352 and 354 and the corresponding control data PMT<br>
are stored in a memory 362 in a multiplex format under a<br>
time-sharing manner.<br>
Thus, the video and the audio data of the<br>
service 1011 are multiplexed under a time-sharing manner and<br>
stored in the memory 362.<br>
As shown in Fig. 12, the plurality of HTML files<br>
include, e.g., such as "forecast.html", "today.html11 through<br>
"osaka.html" and the image files include, e.g., "sun.gif"<br>
through "rain.gif", both stored in a directory "Vweather".<br>
plurality of HTML and image files are stored in a data<br>
storage unit 314D. In this way, images such as those shown<br>
in Fig. 14A through Fig. 14C, can be displayed in accordance<br>
with the HTML files "forecast.html", "today.html" and<br>
"osaka.html" depicted respectively in Fig. 13A through Fig.<br>
13C.<br>
A data converter 375 sequentially assigns individual<br>
file identifiers to each of the files. The file-ids are<br>
stored as an object header for each file. Data converter 375<br>
also creates a correspondence table between the file<br>
identifiers thus assigned and name of the files. In this<br>
embodiment, file-ids consisting of a total of four digits<br>
such as id = "0001" (expressed in hexadecimal) are<br>
sequentially assigned to the files in the directory "weather"<br>
as shown in Fig. 15. The sequential assignment is made from<br>
the top (Yforecast.html) through the bottom file (not shown)<br>
of the directory "Vweather" as described later. Similarly,<br>
directory identifiers consisting of four digits such as id =<br>
"0001" are assigned to the directory "Yweather" which<br>
includes each of the files. Together, the directory_id and<br>
file_id make up the module identifier. This is to definitely<br>
specify each of the files with an absolute path including<br>
name of the directory as shown in Fig. 15. For example, a<br>
file "¥forecast.html" can definitely be specified as<br>
"¥weather¥forecast.html" can definitely be specified as<br>
"weatherforecast.html" or "0001/0001". In this way, a<br>
correspondence table shown in Fig. 15 is created by assigning<br>
both the directory_id and the file_id to each module as its<br>
module identifier.<br>
The data converter 375 consists of a combination of<br>
hardware and software structures in this embodiment. Fig. 16<br>
shows a typical example of the hardware structure of the data<br>
converter 375. A corresponding chart shown in Fig. 17A is<br>
stored in a ROM 375r. Steps performed in a software<br>
structure for data conversion used by the CPU 375c will be<br>
described with reference to Fig. 18.<br>
The CPU 375c initializes the counter i (step S201, in<br>
Fig. 18). Then, the file corresponding to the counter i is<br>
stored into the corresponding chart (step S203) . For<br>
example, the top file "¥forecast.html" of the directory<br>
"¥weather" is stored into a region representing module number<br>
1. Thus, the file "¥weatherYforecast.html" is assigned the<br>
module_id "0001/0001" as shown in Fig. 17B. In this<br>
embodiment, the module identifiers consist of the four digit<br>
file_id = "0001" and the four digit directory_id = "000l" as<br>
described above.<br>
Next, the CPU 375c determines whether or not all the<br>
files are stored in the corresponding chart (step S207). If<br>
files have not been so stored, the CPU 375c increments the<br>
counter i by one (step S209), and stores the next file in the<br>
corresponding chart (step S203). Creation of the<br>
corresponding chart is completed when the step S203 is<br>
carried out to all the files.<br>
The corresponding chart thus created is provided to a<br>
packeting component 377, shown in Fig. 11, together with each<br>
of the modules, and is stored in a memory 382 after<br>
packetization.<br>
The data from the data converter 375 is packetized into<br>
packets having a fixed length by the packeting component 377.<br>
The packeting component 377 assigns individual PIDs to the<br>
section headers of all the packets generated. In this<br>
embodiment, the first four digits and the last four digits<br>
are respectively assigned as the PID and the<br>
table_id_extension region (field) because the module<br>
identifiers consist of the directory_id and the file_id (a<br>
total of eight digits).<br>
In this way, the packets making up each file can<br>
definitely be specified without further consideration in the<br>
receiver by distinguishing them using the PID of each packet<br>
and the table_id_extension as a result of distinguishing the<br>
modules by the PID and the table_id_extension of each packet.<br>
Further, the packeting component 377 also packetizes the<br>
corresponding chart created by the data converter 375 into<br>
packets having a fixed length. In other words, the<br>
corresponding chart is multiplexed as the correspondence<br>
table 109 depicted in Fig. 4.<br>
There are table_id regions (fields) for setting own<br>
table_id, each having a predetermined data length, and<br>
table_id_extension regions (fields) for setting own<br>
table_id_extensions in the sections heads of each packet.<br>
Their own module identifiers are stored in the<br>
table_id_extension fields as the table_id_extensions. The<br>
details of this relationship will be described later.<br>
A packet multiplex controller 384 reads out the data<br>
stored in the memory 382 in response to, its encoding speed.<br>
Also, the controller 384 provides PIDs assigned to the data<br>
to a PMT generating circuit 386.<br>
The PMT generating circuit 386 generates a control data<br>
PMT 114 (see Fig. 4) as a result of receiving the PIDs. The<br>
PIDs for each packet related to contained in the service 1014<br>
are listed in the control data PMT 114. Both the data thus<br>
read out from the memory 382 and the corresponding control<br>
data PMT are stored in a memory 364 in a multiplex format<br>
under a time-sharing manner. Additionally, the PMT 114<br>
contains the module_id into an additional information field<br>
by the circuit 386, the module_id corresponding to an HTML<br>
file comprising a front page displayed initially in the<br>
service 1014 as shown in Fig. 7. In this way, a<br>
table_id_extension "0x0001" is written to an additional<br>
information field in the PMT of the service 1014 as a file_id<br>
of the front page when the front page is represented by file<br>
"¥weather¥forecast.html", because the file<br>
"YweatherYforecast.html11 is replaced with a file_id "0001"<br>
during the packetization. Also, the file<br>
"YweatherYforecast.html" is replaced respectively with a PID<br>
"0x0001" and a table_id "0x0001" during the packetization.<br>
1 - 2 - 2. Receiver<br>
1-2-2-1. Hardware structure<br>
The hardware structure of the receiver 11 depicted in<br>
Fig. 1 is shown in Fig. 19. The receiver 11 functions as a<br>
receiver of satellite broadcasting as well as a device for<br>
displaying HTML data on a monitor.<br>
The function of the receiver 11 in receiving satellite<br>
broadcasting is similar to that of the conventional<br>
broadcasting receiver, as briefly described below. Radio<br>
waves transmitted by the transmitter are caught with an<br>
antenna 131, and the radio waves are supplied to a tuner 132.<br>
The tuner 132 selects one of the transport streams in<br>
accordance with a command of the CPU 147. Further, the tuner<br>
132 carries out demodulation and error-correction and other<br>
relevant operations, and outputs the resultant signals to a<br>
transport decoder 141.<br>
The transport decoder 141 only selects (i.e.,<br>
filters) predetermined packets out of the packets<br>
multiplexed within the selected transport stream in<br>
accordance with PIDs set therein by the CPU 147.<br>
PacketIzed data for the system are contained in the<br>
multiplexed packets other than control data, video data<br>
and audio data because the system data are also<br>
multiplexed together with the video data and the audio<br>
data. The transport decoder 141 identifies these data in<br>
accordance with the data stored in the headers in each of<br>
the files, and both the control data and the system data<br>
are stored in a RAM 144. The RAM 144 stores the<br>
packetized data under the file basis so that the<br>
packetized data thus stored forms to one independent<br>
file.<br>
Filtering procedure carried out in the<br>
transport decoder 141 will be described with reference to<br>
Fig. 20. Conditions for performing filtering of data<br>
(hereinafter referred to as filtering conditions) are<br>
stored in a filtering conditions storing unit 154. For<br>
example, PIDs, the table_id and table_id_extensions of *<br>
the packets to be selected are stored therein. A PID<br>
selecting unit 156 selects the packets having<br>
predetermined PIDs in accordance with the filtering<br>
conditions stored in the filtering conditions storing<br>
unit 154. The packets of video data and that of audio<br>
data, are respectively outputted to a video decoder 137<br>
and an audio decoder 134. Packets of HTML or image data in a<br>
selection format with the selected packets are outputted to a<br>
section data selecting unit 155 shown in Fig. 20. The<br>
section data selecting unit 155 only outputs the packets<br>
having predetermined table_id_extensions in accordance with<br>
the filtering conditions stored in the filtering conditions<br>
storing unit 154.<br>
A conditions varying unit 153 varies filtering<br>
conditions stored in the filtering conditions storing unit<br>
154 in accordance with a rewrite command outputted by the CPU<br>
147 (as shown in Fig. 19).<br>
The video data are provided to the video decoder 137<br>
through the FIFO memory 136 depicted in Fig. 19, and are<br>
decompressed or expanded thereby. The video data are<br>
converted into analog signals with a digital/analog converter<br>
(hereinafter referred to as D/A converter) 138, and the<br>
analog signals are displayed on a monitor 140 such as a<br>
liquid crystal display, a cathode ray tube and the like<br>
through a video synthesizer 139. The data representing<br>
characters stored in a video RAM (hereinafter referred to as<br>
VRAM) are converted into analog signals with another D/A<br>
converter 145, and the analog signals are provided to the<br>
video synthesizer 139. In this way, characters can be<br>
overlapped on images displayed on the monitor.<br>
The audio data, on the contrary, are provided to the<br>
audio decoder 134 through another FIFO memory 133, and are<br>
decompressed or expanded thereby. The audio data are<br>
outputted through a speaker 135 as actual sound.<br>
A remote controller 149 stores the following commands<br>
such as initialization of watching, designation of services,<br>
instruction for category search for the program information<br>
or the like, and the controller 149 outputs them to a<br>
microcomputer 148 installed in the main part of the receiver<br>
11.<br>
The CPU 147 controls the tuner 132, the transport<br>
decoder 141 and relevant cpmoonents In accordance with a<br>
receiving operation control program 142c and a display<br>
program 142a both stored in a ROM 142/ These programs may be<br>
capable of stand alone operation, or may require an operating<br>
system (such as Windows CE by Microsoft Inc.) as a<br>
premise.<br>
1 - 2 - 2 - 2. Receiving operation control program<br>
An embodiment of the receiving operation control program<br>
142c used for carrying out receiving operations will be<br>
described with reference to Fig. 19 and Fig. 21. Operations<br>
necessary to switch the receiver 11 from receiving the<br>
service 1013 contained in the transport stream 1010, to<br>
receiving another service 1011 included in the transport<br>
stream 1010, will be described herein. A switching command<br>
is sent by the remote controller 149 or a control panel (not<br>
shown) to the CPU 147. The switching command is provided to<br>
the CPU 147 through a microcomputer 148 (as shown in Fig.<br>
19). In response to the switching command, the CPU 147 sets<br>
PIDs of the control data PAT into a register (not shown) for<br>
separating the control data in the transport decoder 141.<br>
The PID of the control data PAT has a fixed value such as<br>
"0x0000". In this way, contents of the control data PAT<br>
being separated are stored in the RAM 144 under the control<br>
of the transport decoder 141 (step Sll, in Fig. 21). A list<br>
of the services multiplexed in the transport stream currently<br>
received are shown in the contents of the control data PAT<br>
(see Fig. 8). The CPU 147 determines that the desired<br>
service 1011 is multiplexed in the transport stream 1010<br>
currently received by referring the list. The CPU 147<br>
continues processing from step S12. to step S18.<br>
In the step S18, the CPU 147 obtains<br>
PIDs of the control data PMT in the desired<br>
service 1011 in accordance, with the contents of the<br>
control data PAT. As a result, the CPU 147<br>
recognizes that id "0x0011" is for a PID of the<br>
control data PMT in the desired service 1011 as shown<br>
in Fig. 8. Further, the CPU 147 sets the PID<br>
"0x0011" of the control data PMT into the register<br>
for separating the control data in the transport decoder<br>
141 (step S19). Hence, the control data PMT 111 in the<br>
service 1011 can be separated from other data, and<br>
contents of which can be stored in the RAM 144.<br>
Next, the CPU 147 recognizes PIDs "0x0022" and<br>
"0x0024" of the video data 81V and the audio data 81A<br>
respectively, in accordance with the PMT for the service<br>
1011 as shown in Fig. 6 (step S20).<br>
Then, the CPU 147 sets both the PIDs "0x0022"<br>
and "0x0024" into the filtering conditions storing unit<br>
154 (see Fig. 20) in the transport decoder 141 (step<br>
S22). In this way, the transport decoder 141 can<br>
selectively output both the video data 81V and the audio<br>
data 81A, both being required.<br>
The CPU 147 proceeds its processing to step S13<br>
if the desired service is not multiplexed in the<br>
transport stream currently received in step S12.<br>
Further, the CPU 147 obtains PIDs of the control data NIT<br>
assigned in the control data PAT. In accordance with the<br>
PIDs thus obtained, the CPU 147 obtains the control data<br>
NIT, and determines whether the desired service contained<br>
in any of the transport streams (step S14, step S15). *<br>
The CPU 147 switches a setting of the tuner 34<br>
so as to receive the transport stream which contains the<br>
desired service (step S16). Then, the CPU 147 obtains<br>
the control data PAT of the transport stream (step S17).<br>
Hereafter, steps following to step S18 may be performed,<br>
as described above.<br>
1-2-2-3. Display program<br>
The function for displaying HTML data on the<br>
monitor is accomplished by the CPU 147 and the display<br>
program 142a stored in the ROM 142.<br>
Data obtained is stored in the RAM 144 when the<br>
data is system data under the control of the transport<br>
decoder 141. The CPU 147 starts performing the display<br>
program 142a when the system data is supplied by the<br>
transport decoder 141 because the CPU 147 recognizes data<br>
written in a section format as system data in this<br>
embodiment.<br>
Steps performed by the display program 142a for<br>
displaying HTML files will be described with reference to<br>
Fig. 19 and Fig. 22.<br>
At first, a switching command, for switching<br>
the operations to a service in which the HTML files are<br>
received, is outputted by the remote controller 149 in<br>
accordance with input of the operator who refers a<br>
program table. As a result of receiving the command, the<br>
CPU 147 varies filtering conditions in the tuner 132 and<br>
the transport decoder 141 respectively.<br>
For example, the operator selects a service id<br>
= "001" with the remote controller 149 when he/she find<br>
out a weather forecast which provides interactive service<br>
can be specified by the service id = "001" by referring<br>
to the program table.<br>
Control data PAT is obtained by varying the<br>
filtering conditions of the transport decoder 141 to PID<br>
= "0x0000" with the CPU 147 because the PID of the PAT is<br>
a fixed value "0x0000". Steps for obtaining the control<br>
data PAT are performed after switching the tuner 132 so<br>
as to receive a transport stream in which a service<br>
specified by the service id = "001" is multiplexed as a<br>
result of obtaining the control data NIT thereof when the<br>
service having the service id = "001" is multiplexed in<br>
the transport stream other than the transport stream<br>
currently received.<br>
A PMT of the service specified by the service<br>
id = "001" can be obtained once the control data PAT is<br>
obtained. As a result of obtaining the PMT, an id of the<br>
transport stream in which the service is multiplexed,<br>
PIDs of packets in which data related to the service is<br>
stored, and table_id_extensions of the file which are<br>
displayed at first can automatically be obtained. Under<br>
this logic, the CPU 147 varies filtering conditions in<br>
the transport decoder 141 while switching the tuner 132<br>
in order to receive the service. In this way, receipt of<br>
a service specified by a service id "001" is started.<br>
For instance, the CPU 147 varies filtering<br>
conditions in the transport decoder 141 so as to select<br>
packets of a PID "0x0001", that of a table_id "0x3C", and<br>
that of a table_ld_extension "0x0001" shown in Fig. 23A<br>
when the PID, the table_id, and the table_id_extension of<br>
the service specified by the service id = "001" are<br>
respectively "0x0001", "0x3C", and "0x0001" according to<br>
the PMT. The table_id is a fixed value of "0x3C".<br>
Further, the numbers "Ox" means that the numbers<br>
following thereto are expressed in hexadecimal in this<br>
embodiment.<br>
Consequently, the transport decoder 141 selects<br>
the packets having their PIDs, table_id, and<br>
table_id_extension as "0x0001", "0x3C", and "0x0001"<br>
respectively. Selective reception of the HTML files<br>
shown in Fig. 13A according to the filtering conditions<br>
will be described below as an example.<br>
The CPU 147 judges whether or not the system<br>
data stored in the RAM 144 comes to one independent file<br>
(step S101, in Fig. 22). In a concrete form, the<br>
judgement can be carried out by detecting whether or not<br>
the last block of the system data is received. The<br>
counter i is initialized once the one independent file is<br>
received (step S103). The CPU 147 detects existence of<br>
an automatic reference tag in the HTML data of the file<br>
located in 1 th row thereof (step S105). The automatic<br>
reference tag is defined as image tags for referring<br>
other file(s) regardless of the operations by the<br>
operator. Operations related to the automatic reference<br>
tag will be described later. Since the counter i was<br>
initially set to 0, the first time CPU 147 executes step<br>
S105, it will move onto step S1ll and generate display<br>
data according to. the data located in the i th row. The<br>
display data is stored to a VRAM 146, then converted into<br>
analog data by the D/A converter 145. After conversion<br>
to analog data, the display data is provided to the video<br>
synthesizer 139. The video synthesizer 139 outputs<br>
display data which is synthesized with the data from the<br>
video decoder 137 thereby to the monitor 140. Hence, a<br>
image according to the data located i th row is displayed<br>
on the monitor 140.<br>
Next, the CPU 147 increments the counter i by<br>
one (step S113), and judges whether or not a tag<br>
