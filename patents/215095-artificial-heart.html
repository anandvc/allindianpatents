COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(SEE SECTION 10)<br>
ARTIFICIAL HEART<br>
DR. RAMCHANDRA KASHINATH BHIDE 1187/12, P.K.SADAN, BEHIND MODERN HIGH SCHOOL, SHIVAJINAGAR, PUNE.411005. MAHARASHTRA. INDIA.<br>
INDIAN<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates in general to artificial hearts and more particularly to an artificial<br>
heart system that will give a flow like the natural heart and changes the flow depending<br>
upon requirement like the natural heart and yet is small enough to be totally inside the<br>
human body and is untethered.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Over the last several years" progress in developing a permanent artificial heart for<br>
implantation in a patient as a substitute for a failed natural heart has been steady. Initial<br>
clinical application of total artificial heart as a bridge to transplantation was done in 1969.<br>
This has been followed by several additional cases at various institutions. In 1982 the<br>
first pneumatically driven tethered artificial heart intended for permanent replacement<br>
was implanted. There are a lot of groups working all around the world on this artificial<br>
heart problem. The American, European, Canadian, Chinese, Korean, Japanese and so<br>
on . the devices can be divided in three groups - the large ones like Jarvik 7, Small but<br>
non pulsatile, like Jarvik 2000, NASA , CFVAD-Utah, And Unnatural pulsatile flow like<br>
Abiomed and Penn state-3M.<br>
Following table gives the comparison between our device with other devices.<br><br>
Desired features in Ideal Total Artificial Heart.	Our Device	Abiocor, Pennstate-3M.	Jarvic7 And other Similar devices.	Continuous flow devices.<br>
Pulsatile Function.	YES	YES	YES	NO<br>
Physiologic Pulse.	YES	NO	YES	NO<br>
Totally Implantable	YES	YES	NO	????<br>
Total range of mobility	YES	YES	NO	????<br>
Heaviest work possible.	YES	NO	NO	????<br>
Intact Skin	YES	YES	NO	????<br>
All these are not suitable for human use as either these are too big or the characteristic of the flow: both "systolic out flow" as well as the "diastolic in flow" are unnatural. In our device both these flows are like the natural heart and it is small enough for implantation. Amongst all other devices the Abiomed and Pennstate-3M are small and give unnatural pulsatile flow.<br><br>
Following are the advantages of our device over the Abiomed and Pennstate-3M devices.<br>
•	Synchronous left and right ejection like the natural heart.<br>
•	Systolic outflow like the natural heart.<br>
•	No excess pressure or flow on pulmonary side. Therefore no need of third hydraulic chamber.<br>
•	Systole : diastole ratio just like the natural heart.<br>
•	Higher flows possible therefore heaviest work possible.<br>
•	Diastolic inflow is like the natural heart that is the filling of the blood chamber is both active and passive like the natural heart.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of this invention to provide an artificial heart which is a<br>
synchronously pulsatile totally implantable pumping device which has systolic outflow<br>
and diastolic in flow like the natural heart and the flow and beat rate are adjusted on<br>
a beat-by-beat basis so that the device is stable and sensitive to both left and right<br>
atrial pressures.<br>
This invention utilizes to and fro pumping device employing a reservoir chamber and<br>
a pump chamber, The pump chamber divided into left and right pumping chambers<br>
each divided by a membrane into a blood pumping chamber and a hydraulic<br>
pumping chamber and a hydraulic pumping system for alternately pumping hydraulic<br>
fluid from said reservoir chamber toward the said pumping chamber in the first state<br>
of ejection of blood and in the reverse direction during the second state of blood<br>
chamber filling.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
The preferred embodiment of this invention will now be described by way of example<br>
with the help of drawing accompanying this specification.<br>
In the drawing, the figure 1 is the schematic representation of the view of the artificial<br>
heart in accordance with the principles of this invention.<br>
In this artificial heart there are two sides right [R] and left [L] pumping in the<br>
pulmonary and systemic circulations respectively. The  Blood enters from the<br>
respective atria through the inlet and inlet valve [7] into the blood chamber [6] from<br>
where it is pumped out through the outlet via the outlet valve [1] in to the respective<br>
great arteries. The fluid from the reservoir chambers [9] moves in and out of the right<br><br>
and left hydraulic chambers [5] by the action of the pump motor valve unit[8]. The two hydraulic chambers are separated by a rigid partition [2] and has a flexible membrane [3]separating it from the blood chamber. The blood chamber has an outer rigid wall [4]. The function of the device is controlled by a control [10]. There is an internal stand by battery [11] for support during the off belt state. The device gets energy supply from an external battery source[17] through a power module [16] and transmitted from out of the skin to the inside the skin by induction from the external induction coil [14]to internal induction coil [13]keeping the skin intact and from the internal induction coil to the control through the rectifier circuit [12]. The external components are held in place with the help of a belt [15] DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention utilizes to and fro pumping device employing a reservoir chamber and a pump chamber, The pump chamber divided into left and right pumping chambers each in turn divided by a membrane into a blood pumping chamber and a hydraulic pumping chamber. A hydraulic pumping system that pumps hydraulic fluid from said reservoir chamber toward the said pumping chamber in the first state of ejection of blood. During the second state of blood chamber filling the fluid moves in the reverse direction both actively as well as passively.<br>
An electrohydraulic energy system drives the blood pumps employing a hydraulic fluid, operating at physiological pressures. This hydraulic coupling between the blood pumps and the energy converter allows geometric flexibility. There is a 1:1 correspondence between blood and hydraulic fluid displacement. The energy converter consists of a rotary pump driven by a brushless D.C. motor with a valve. There are, then, essentially two moving parts, the pump motor and the valve. The motor sits immersed in the hydraulic fluid which fills the energy system housing. This ensures temperature uniformity of the system. Waste heat is transferred to the blood across the pump diaphragms and from the housing to contacting body fluid and surfaces. In this system the systolic/diastolic ratio is variable like the natural heart and at rest it is 1:2 and changes as per the physiological needs. The artificial heart system reacts (both stroke volume and beat rate) to changes in the available fill volume and adjusts the outflow pressure to accommodate the outflow impedance. Since withdrawal of hydraulic flow in to the reservoir chamber is passive + active [mostly passive], the diastolic inflow of blood in to the blood chambers is also mostly passive like the natural heart, this suits the internal environment being both blood friendly as well as lung and vascular friendly.<br><br>
[ Active suction throughout is damaging to blood, lungs, as well as vascular system.]<br>
The pump cycle is as follows:<br>
During the phase of systole [first part of the cycle of ejection of blood] the fluid from the reservoir chamber is pumped by the pump-motor unit in to the right and left hydraulic parts of the pump chamber leading to the movement of the flexible membrane between the blood chamber and hydraulic chambers which results in synchronous ejection of blood from both the right and left blood chambers in to the respective great arteries.<br>
During the other phase that is diastole [second part of the cycle that is filling of blood chambers] the fluid flows back from the hydraulic chambers to the reservoir chambers both actively and passively, thus resulting in synchronous passive and active filling of the blood chambers like the natural heart.<br>
The advantages of this type of cycle are:<br>
•	Synchronous left and right ejection like the natural heart.<br>
•	Systolic outflow like the natural heart.<br>
•	No excess pressure or flow on pulmonary side. Therefore no need of third hydraulic chamber.<br>
•	Systole: diastole ratio just like the natural heart.<br>
•	Higher flows possible therefore heaviest work possible.<br>
•	Diastolic inflow is like the natural heart that is the filling of the blood chamber is both active and passive like the natural heart.<br>
The said electro hydraulic system is under the influence of a control, that is connected to an internal battery, and internal induction coil for electric supply and if necessary through a rectifier circuit and having an external induction coil fitted just around the internal coil so that this external induction coil which receives the electric supply from external battery transmits it to the internal coil for onward transmission to the control, the external induction coil and external battery are attached to a belt which remains outside the patient"s body, if necessary there could be a power module between the external induction coil and external battery; there is an alarm provided on this belt to give a warning about electric supply and device function; the parts of the device which remain inside the body are covered by bio-compatible material, if desired, the external coil can be connected to the central power supply for electrical energy. There are sensors for sensing both atrial and both blood chamber pressures; and ECG signals from native atria in case if it is used to assist the native heart; said sensors<br><br>
providing output signals to said control means to control the rate of flow of hydraulic fluid through said hydraulic pumping means, and to control the frequency at which said hydraulic pumping means switches from one state to the other; said pumping means includes a variable speed hydraulic pump and switch able valving means to direct the flow in response to signals from said control means; said pumping means includes a variable speed motor and wherein the signals from said sensors cause said control means to vary the speed of said motor.<br>
This Artificial Heart can be used as a total replacement device in place of the natural heart when there is no hope of recovery of the native heart or alternately it can be used keeping in the natural heart in place connecting the device by the side of the natural heart as a bi ventricular assist device under the situations where there is some likelihood of recovery of the native heart and both right and left sides are in failure or it can be used only as a single reservoir chamber and single pumping chamber by the side of the native heart as univentricular assist device in case only one - either the left or the right side of the heart is in failure and there is some chance of recovery. Modifications and alternative embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art in view of the foregoing description. This description is to be construed as illustrative only, and is for the purpose of teaching those skilled in the art the best mode of carrying out the invention. The details of the structure and method may be varied substantially without departing from the spirit of the invention, and the exclusive use of all modifications that come within the scope of the appended claims is reserved<br><br>
