				<td>The present invention relates to a column tray which can be used as a support tray for random packings and/or packings and/or structured packings, and/or a liquid distributor, liquid redistributor and/or liquid collector, where superstructures are embedded between the random packings and/or structured packings of the column, and a column having such column trays.<br>
In the case of known columns comprising structured packings and/or random packings, these are held in the column by at least one support tray. The liquid is distributed as uniformly as possible over the bed of structured packings or bed of random packings at the feed point or the reflux point by means of a liquid distributor tray. The structured packings or the random packings rest on the support tray. The column has, as a rule, a plurality of beds of structured packings or random packings. Between two successive beds of structured packings or dumped packings, the liquid must be distributed as uniformly as possible over the bed underneath. Liquid collectors are used for collecting liquid, for example on a bed underneath, or for removing liquid, for example from the column. Thus, in known columns comprising structured packings and/or dumped packings, support trays, liquid distributors, liquid redistributors and/or liquid collectors are used as individual trays.<br>
For corrosion-resistant plant construction, in particular for the diameter range from 600mm to over 2000mm, enamel columns are used.<br>
For design reasons, the internals for the columns (liquid distributor, liquid redistributor, liquid collector and mass transfer tray) are manufactured from materials other than steel/enamel. The support trays constitute an exception. Support trays which are in the form of slotted trays and whose slotted plate is enamelled on both sides are known. These known steel/enamel support trays have a free cross-section of only about 40%, based on the total column cross-section. This small free cross-section has the considerable disadvantage that no<br>
1<br><br>
high gas loads (F factors greater than 1.8) and liquid loads (greater than 40 m3m2h) can be run in the column, although this would be possible with modern structured packings and dumped packings.<br>
It is known that constructions of tantalum or ceramic can be used to enable high gas loads (F factors greater than 1.8) to be run in the column. However, ceramic has less corrosion resistance than glass and enamel. Tantalum constructions are considerably more expensive than steel/enamel constructions.<br>
In order to provide large flow cross-sections from the gas flow in the case of columns having a high gas throughput, US 4,028,442, which describes a column tray according to the precharacterizing clause of Claim 1, discloses that a column tray which is not flat should be provided for a column having a high gas throughput. In order to increase the flow cross-section for the gas throughput, the column tray has a grid which is undulating or formed with inclined or perpendicular sections and is supported on a support structure in the column. Owing to the inclined or perpendicular shape of the grid with the orifices formed therein for the gas flow, the flow cross-section is greater than in the case of a flat embodiment of the grid.<br>
US 5,281,369 discloses column trays having a grid which is undulating or is arranged on a support structure. The grid is formed in such a way that the gas stream passes through the region of the wave summits while the liquid is collected in the valleys and emerges downwards through small holes. Since the gas stream and the liquid stream are passed along substantially separate routes through the column tray, a higher gas flow rate can be achieved with the same liquid throughput.<br>
These known column trays have the disadvantage that they cannot be produced out of corrosion-resistant materials without considerable costs.   In addition, a<br>
2<br><br>
support structure for the grids is required in the case of the known column trays.<br>
It is therefore the object of the invention to provide a column tray, which can be produced easily and economically from corrosion-resistant material, and with which a high gas flow rate is achievable.<br>
This object of the invention is achieved by a column tray according to the features of Claim 1. According to claim 1 of the invention, a column tray which can be used as a support tray for dumped packings and/or packings and/or structured packings, having a tray and gas penetration holes which are formed in such a way that their orifices are perpendicular or inclined to the column tray, is characterized in that the column tray has superstructures, the tray has passages for receiving the superstructures, and the gas penetration holes are arranged in the superstructures.<br>
This column tray according to the invention is simpler and cheaper to produce because the formation of a flat tray which can therefore be enamelled is possible by increasing the free cross-section for the gas penetration in the superstructures.<br>
Since the gas penetration holes are formed in the superstructures, it is possible to make the tray of the column tray flat. This has the advantage that the tray can be coated with highly corrosion-resistant materials, such as, for example, enamel and the plastics mentioned in the further claims. Furthermore, the column tray according to the invention can be clamped in a simple manner between two column sections. It is therefore possible - but not necessary - to form the column tray without the known support construction.<br>
According to the invention, it may be possible also to form further gas penetration holes in the tray itself.   According to the invention, however, gas<br>
3<br><br>
penetration holes must also be formed in the superstructures in order to create a sufficiently large gas penetration cross-section.<br>
The invention has the further advantage that the tray of the column tray can be formed from steel with a corrosion-resistant coating and the superstructures of more complicated design can be formed from a corrosion-resistant plastic and/or from glass.<br>
According to the invention, the superstructures can be formed in such a way that they form a support for a structured packing on which the packing rests. The superstructures can furthermore form a support for at least one grid on which the structured packing and/or the random packings rest.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, the superstructures are embedded between the random packings and/or structured packings of the column. This has the advantage that there is no loss or only a very small loss of the active column height. The column tray according to the invention which is used as a support tray preferably has small holes for the liquid throughput, the random packings and structured packings preferably being present in the intermediate spaces between the superstructures of the column, and the superstructures thus extending into the random packing or structured packing layer.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, the column tray can additionally be used as a liquid distributor, liquid redistributor and/or liquid collector. As a result of the dual function of the column tray, the column has fewer components and is more economical. According to the invention, in some embodiments, the separate components of support grid, collector and liquid redistributor otherwise customary in column construction can be combined into one component.<br>
4<br><br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, the area of the tray is greater than the cross-sectional area of the column. This has the advantage that the tray can be clamped between two column sections. According to the invention, the area of the tray will also be equal to the cross-sectional area of the column. In this case, the tray can be suspended from the tray above or can rest on the tray underneath.<br>
German Offenlegungsschrift 1 262 225 discloses a mass transfer tray in which the bubble-caps can be inserted into the tray by simply pressing in.<br>
German Offenlegungsschrift DE 36 04 013 Al (US 4 820 455 A) describes a large-size corrosion-resistant mass transfer tray which consists of a glass fibre-reinforced core which is surrounded by a thin corrosion-resistant covering of PVDF. Holes for bubble-caps are provided in the tray.<br>
German Offenlegungsschrift DE 29 43 687 Al (US 4 427 605 A) discloses a column tray according to the precharacterizing clause of Claim 7, according to which the superstructures are embedded between the random packings and/or structured packings of the column.<br>
The liquid distributor shown has an area which is smaller than the cross-section of the column so that the gas can pass through upwards adjacent to the tray, and the free cross-section is therefore relatively large. A collector must therefore be provided above the liquid distributor in order to apply the liquid to the liquid distributor.  Moreover, a support for the tray must be provided.<br>
It is also the object of the invention to avoid these disadvantages of the prior art.<br>
This object of the invention is achieved by a column tray according to the features of Claim 1, According to which, a column tray which can be used as a<br>
5<br><br>
liquid distributor, liquid redistributor and/or liquid collector, having a tray, superstructures and gas penetration holes which are provided in the superstructures and are formed in such a way that their orifices are perpendicular or inclined to the column tray, is characterized in that the tray has passages for receiving the superstructures, and the area of the tray is greater than or equal to the cross-sectional area of the column.<br>
The embodiment of the invention has the advantage that gas penetration orifices can be provided in the superstructures in order to achieve a high free cross-section for the gas penetration. It is therefore possible to form the tray up to the edge of the column, with a sufficient free cross-section for the gas penetration. Since the column tray is thus directly adjacent to the wall of the column and can be fastened or flange-connected there, the column tray according to the invention has a dual function, i.e. the support for the column tray can be omitted. Furthermore, the collector arranged over the liquid distributor can be omitted because the liquid distributor extends over the total cross-section of the column.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, the column tray can additionally be used as a support tray for random packings and/or structured packings, and the superstructures are formed in such a way that they form a support for at least one structured packing and/or for at least one grid, on which grid or grids random packings rest. In this embodiment, a further part is omitted owing to the dual function of the column tray, with the result that, on the one hand, the active column height increases and, on the other hand, the costs can be reduced.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the tray of the column tray is made flat. This has the advantage that the tray can be more simply produced and can be more easily provided with a corrosion-resistant coating.<br>
6<br><br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, the tray and the superstructures are produced from the same or different corrosion-resistant materials or material combinations.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the superstructures have slots in their top.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, further holes which preferably have a smaller cross-section than the passages for receiving the superstructures are provided in the tray in addition to the passages for receiving the superstructures. For example, distributor cups can be arranged in these further holes for converting the column tray into a liquid distributor or liquid redistributor. In some applications, it may be advantageous if small distributor tubes are fastened in the bores of the distributor cups by screwing together, by a plug connection or in another manner, in such a way that targeted liquid distribution over structured packings or random packings of the column can be ensured.<br>
According to the invention, the superstructures may have side walls which are substantially perpendicular to the column tray, and the gas penetration holes can be formed in the side walls of the superstructures.<br>
According to the invention, the gas penetration holes can be in particular in the form of longitudinal slots. The longitudinal slots can preferably run in each case from a point above the liquid level, which is to form during operation on the column tray used as a liquid distributor, liquid redistributor and/or liquid collector, preferably up to the upper end region of the superstructure. This embodiment of the invention is possible if the column tray is to be used as a liquid distributor or liquid collector. If the column tray according to the invention is to be used as a support tray, the longitudinal slots preferably extend over substantially the total height of the superstructures.<br>
7<br><br>
According to the invention, the side walls may have a round, a circular, a polygonal, a rectangular or a square superstructure cross-section which preferably corresponds to the cross-section of the holes of the tray in which the superstructures are arranged.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the superstructures may have hoods to prevent the entry of the liquid into the superstructures and hence a disturbance of the gas flow in the opposite direction. Depending on the application, the hood may have slots in order to provide additional gas penetration holes.<br>
In order to provide a highly corrosion-resistant column tray, the tray may be formed, according to the invention, from steel with an enamel coating, steel with a coating of a corrosion-resistant plastic, from corrosion-resistant special alloys or tantalum or from a corrosion-resistant plastic. Moreover, the superstructures can and should likewise be corrosion-resistant, for example of corrosion-resistant plastic, of glass, of corrosion-resistant special alloys or tantalum. The plastic may comprise polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), perfluoroalkoxy polymers (PFA), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), polyethylene (PE), a plastic similar thereto or a combination of these plastics.<br>
According to the invention, the superstructure in at least one passage can be arranged lower so that this superstructure can be used as an outflow pipe to the next lowest column tray.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to provide a universal tray for the column trays according to the invention, which tray is simple to produce.<br>
This object is achieved by the features of Claim 26, according to which, the present invention for a column tray has passages for receiving suitable superstructures adapted to the respective purpose of the tray. The tray can be used as a universal tray so that, by holding suitable superstructures adapted to<br>
8<br><br>
the respective purpose of the tray, the tray can be formed as a support tray, as a liquid distributor, as a liquid redistributor, as a liquid collector and/or as a mass transfer tray. Preferably, the tray has passages of relatively large diameter and further holes of relatively small diameter, which in particular in each case are distributed uniformly.<br>
The tray according to the invention has the advantage that the operator of the column need stock only one universal basic tray as a spare part for all types of column trays. In addition, the universal tray can be manufactured in relatively large quantities, thus enabling the manufacturing costs to be reduced.<br>
The universal tray according to the invention can be formed as a. liquid distributor or liquid redistributor by installing chimneys in the passages of relatively large diameter and installing distributor cups or overflow bushes in the holes of relatively small diameter.<br>
Furthermore, the universal tray according to the invention can be formed as a liquid connector by installing chimneys in the passages of relatively large diameter, by omitting or closing the holes of relatively small diameter and by providing at least one outflow pipe.<br>
Furthermore, the universal tray according to the invention can be formed as a support tray by installing, in the passages of relatively large diameter, chimneys provided with longitudinal slots over substantially the entire height.<br>
Furthermore, the universal tray according to the invention can be formed as a support tray and liquid redistributor by installing distributor cups or overflow bushes in the further holes of relatively small diameter.<br>
Furthermore, the universal tray according to the invention can be formed as a mass transfer tray by installing at least one outflow pipe in at least one passage<br>
9<br><br>
of relatively large diameter, by omitting, closing or adapting the other passages of relatively large diameter with corresponding inserts, by installing bubble-caps in the holes of relatively small diameter and by providing at least one outflow pipe.<br>
The invention also comprises the superstructures for retrofitting and/or converting existing trays with production of trays according to the invention or column trays according to the invention.<br>
The invention also comprises a column having at least one column tray according to the invention and/or at least one tray according to the invention and/or at least one superstructure according to the invention.<br>
The column according to the invention may be an enamel-lined column, a column lined with corrosion-resistant plastics, a column lined with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), perfluoroalkoxy polymers (PFA), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), polyethylene (PE) or similar plastic materials, a glass column or a column made of highly corrosion-resistant metals, such as tantalum and special alloys.<br>

Figures 1 and 2 show a column tray according to the invention, which can be used as a liquid distributor and liquid redistributor. Fig. 1 shows a partial cross-section of a column having a liquid distributor or liquid redistributor according to the invention, along the line I-I of Fig. 2. The column tray has a tray 100. This is as a rule mounted in the column by clamping with the aid of flanges (not shown). If the tray 100 consists of a metal coated with enamel or plastic, the coating need not necessarily extend up to the clamped borders or up to border edges. Relatively large holes for receiving the superstructures 110 and relatively small holes for receiving distributor cups 120 are formed in the tray. The superstructures 1 10 substantially comprise a cylinder which is closed at the top with a hood 112 and open at the bottom and in which longitudinal slots are formed above a certain level. In the embodiment shown, two longitudinal slots 111 are formed in the superstructure so that the remaining cylinder pipe 113 and the hood 112 are connected to one another only via two webs.<br>
The superstructure 110 is mounted in the tray 100 by means of a screw connection or a plug connection. The superstructure 110 may also be fastened to the tray in another manner.<br>
12<br><br>
For the sake of clarity, the superstructures 1 10 and distributor cups 120 which do not lie on the line I-I of Fig. 1 have been omitted in Fig. 1.<br>
Fig. 1A shows a distributor cup from the region Z of Fig. 1 on a larger scale. A cross-section of the distributor cup 120 is shown at the top of the circle. The distributor cup 120 has an upper border 121, a cylindrical side wall 122, a bottom 123, and outlet orifices 124 in the tray and optionally at the circumference. A view of the distributor cup 120 from below is shown in the lower part of Fig. 1A.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a cross-sectional plan view of the column of Fig. 1 along the line II-II of Fig. 1. The distribution of the superstructures 110 and of the distributor cups 120 are better recognizable in this view. It can be seen that the distributor cups 120 are distributed virtually uniformly in order to provide as homogeneous a distribution as possible of the liquid over the cross-section.<br>
In the embodiment according to Figures 1 and 2, liquid and gas are passed separately on the column tray. The upward-flowing gas is diverted slightly and passed upwards through the superstructure (vapour/gas chimney). Consequently, the pressure drop on the gas side in the region of the distributor is reduced to a minimum.<br>
The superstructure 110 is designed in such a way that vapours/gases emerge laterally above the liquid level. The superstructures 110 are covered with a hood 112 in order to prevent entry of the liquid arriving from the structured packing above. The superstructure 110 (chimney) used in the tray 100 has, in its lower region 113, a closed cylindrical shape in order to permit backup of the liquid on the tray 100. The distribution of the liquid over the column cross-section is ensured by means of the distributor cups 120. The distributor cups 120 are inserted into the relatively small holes of the tray 110 and are provided with holes 124 in the outflow part.   The number of holes and the hole diameter<br>
13<br><br>
are dimensioned by a person skilled in the art (the number of holes made into the column tray is dependent on the diameter of the column. For a diameter of 1000 mm, 7 large holes having a diameter of 200 mm or if the holes are small then 24 holes having a diameter of 50 mm) so that a liquid backup on the tray 100 is ensured in order to obtain a uniform distribution over the column cross-section. In the case of a low liquid load of, for example, B 
It is also possible to provide overflow bushes having lateral slots or holes above the tray instead of the distributor cups.<br>
In the following embodiments, reference numerals of the components corresponding to the components of the first embodiment (Figures 1 and 2) are each incremented by 100.<br>
In certain modes of operation of the column, it is necessary to withdraw a liquid side take-off of the column. A liquid collector is used for this purpose.<br>
Figures 3 and 4 show a column tray according to the invention which can be used as a liquid collector. Fig. 3 shows a partial cross-section of a column having a liquid collector according to the invention, along the line III—III of Fig. 4, while Fig. 4 shows a cross-sectional plan view of the column of Fig. 3 along the line IV-IV of Fig. 3.<br>
The tray 200 of the column tray has only holes with a large diameter (diameter of 200 mm), in which the superstructures 210 are held. Holes having a smaller diameter (diameter of 50 mm) are not provided.<br>
14<br><br>
The superstructures 210 correspond to the superstructures 110 of the embodiment of Figures 1 and 2. The height of the closed cylinder wall (which ranges from 200 to 800 mm and preferably 400 mm) 213 depends on the height of the connecting piece 20! for the liquid outflow from the column. It is such that total removal of the liquid from the tray can be carried out.<br>
The closed cylindrical height of one or more (depending on the column diameter) superstructures 210A which are equipped with an outflow pipe is slightly less than the height of the other superstructures, in order, in the case of partial withdrawal of the liquid from the column, to convey the remainder via the outflow pipe onto the next tray.<br>
Figures 5 and 6 show a column tray according to the invention, which can be used as a support tray. Fig. 5 shows a partial cross-section of a column having a column tray according to the invention, along the line V-V of Fig. 6. Fig. 6 shows a cross-sectional plan view of the column of Fig. 5 along the line VI-VI of Fig. 5.<br>
The support tray according to Figures 5 and 6 substantially corresponds to the embodiment according to Figures 1 and 2. The superstructures 310 substantially correspond to the superstructures 110. The liquid is discharged through the holes 320 of relatively small diameter. By using different hole diameters, it is in principle possible to pass gas and liquid predominately past one another. By providing distributor cups or overflow bushes in the small holes, the column tray can also be used as a collector and redistributor. In the embodiment shown, the superstructures 310 are slotted over virtually the total cylindrical height in order to obtain a large free cross-section relative to the free column cross-section. A cross-section of more than 100% can be obtained, usually in the range from 80 to 130%, preferably of 110%.<br>

The hood 312 of the superstructures 310 is slotted or perforated for increasing the free cross-section in the direction of flow. In certain embodiments, however, the hood may also be completely absent. Thus, a free cross-section of from 70 to 97%, preferably from 75 to 95%, in the direction of How can be obtained. By the design, according to the invention, of the column tray and the separation of gas and liquid on the tray, the pressure drop on the gas side is reduced to a minimum.<br>
Figures 7 and 8 show a column tray according to the invention which can be used as a mass transfer tray. The column tray shown in Fig. 7 and 8 can also have the superstructure of a flooded bubble-cap tray known per se, but, in a tray according to the invention, the tray and/or the superstructures are produced from the corrosion-resistant materials mentioned. Fig. 7 shows a partial cross-section of a column having a mass transfer tray along the line VII-VII of Fig. 8. The liquid outflow 410 is at a higher level than the upper end of the bubble-cap-like superstructures 420 with slot-like gas penetration orifices 411 in their side walls. Fig. 8 shows a cross-sectional plan view of the column of Fig. 7 along the line VIII-VIII of Fig. 7.<br>
Bubble-caps 420 which are formed, for example, from plastic, such as PTFE, PFA, PVDF or PE, and/or from glass are inserted into the holes of the tray having a relatively small diameter. The bubble-caps 420 are slotted on sides and permit gas penetration into the liquid layer. The liquid is passed transversely over the tray 400 and fed via outflow pipes 410 to the next lowest tray. The outflow pipes 410 are formed, for example, from plastic or glass and are inserted into holes of relatively large diameter.<br>
Fig. 9 shows a cross-sectional partial view through a column according to the invention, comprising a support tray according to the invention for a structured packing. The support tray substantially corresponds to the support tray shown in Figures 5 and 6.  Fig. 9 also shows the structured packing 330 which rests on<br>
16<br><br>
the top of the superstructures 310. The arrows g indicate the gas flow path and the arrows fl indicate the liquid How path through the support tray. It is evident that the flow paths for the liquid and the gas are separated from one another. The free cross-section for the gas penetration in the case of the superstructures 310 is 120%.<br>
Fig. 10 shows a cross-sectional partial view through a column according to the invention, comprising a tray 1 according to invention, from which figure the preferred installation of the tray 1 according to the invention in the column is evident. For the sake of clarity, no orifices are shown in the case of the tray 1. The tray 1 has an area which is slightly greater than the internal cross-sectional area of the column.<br>
The tray 1 is clamped with its border between two outer wall sections 2, 3 of the column which follow one another perpendicularly. A flange 21 is provided on the upper outer wall section 2 and a flange 31 is provided on the lower outer wall section 3. The two flanges 21, 31 are clamped together in a manner known to a person skilled in the art, using, for example, a bolt 4. If the tray 1 is enamelled, for example, up to a region which is clamped between the flanges 21, 31, and the outer wall sections 2, 3 are enamelled on the inside, the column can be made sufficiently corrosion-resistant.<br>
Fig. 11 shows a perspective view of a column tray according to the invention which can be used as a liquid distributor and/or as a liquid redistributor. The column tray substantially corresponds to the column tray shown in Figures 1 and 2, and identical reference numerals denote the corresponding components. In contrast to the column tray shown in Figures 1 and 2, the column tray of Fig. 11 has, in the centre, a larger distributor cup 120A having a plurality of holes in the bottom region, the diameter of which corresponds to the diameter of the passages for the superstructures 110. This has the advantage that the tray 100 is formed in exactly the same way as the tray of the embodiments according to<br>
17<br><br>
Figures 12 and 13 or 3 to 6. Furthermore, lugs 140 for the transportation and the installation of the column tray in the column are provided at the border of the tray 100.<br>
Fig. 12 shows a perspective view of a column tray according to the invention which can be used as a liquid collector. The column tray substantially corresponds to the column tray shown in Figures 3 and 4, and identical reference numerals denote the corresponding components. Lugs 240 for the transportation and the installation of the column tray in the column are provided at the border of the tray 200.<br>
Fig. 13 shows a perspective view of a column tray according to the invention which can be used as a support tray for a structured packing and/or random packing. The column tray substantially corresponds to the column tray shown in Figures 5 and 6, and identical reference numerals denote the corresponding components. Lugs 340 for the transportation and the installation of the column tray in the column are provided at the border of the tray 300.<br>
Fig. 14 shows a perspective view of a column tray according to the invention which can be used as a mass transfer tray. The column tray substantially corresponds to the column tray shown in Figures 7 and 8, and identical reference numerals denote the corresponding components. Lugs 440 for the transportation and the installation of the column tray in the column are provided at the border of the tray 400.<br>
As a result of the design, according to the invention, of the column tray with hole diameters which can be chosen to be different and variations of the superstructures for mounting on the tray, comprising materials such as PTFE, PFA, PVDF, PE or glass, etc., the invention can be used in a very wide range of applications for operating columns, preferably of steel/enamel, steel/PTFE/PFA or glass or highly corrosion-resistant metals, such as tantalum<br>
18<br><br>
and special alloys, also at a very high gas and liquid load, as may occur today with the use of high-performance random packings and structured packings.<br>
The column trays according to the invention have the further advantage that, with a universally combinable corrosion-resistant base tray having suitable holes for receiving various superstructures and optionally smaller holes for the liquid outflow, into which holes distributor cups can be inserted, a very wide range of variants of corrosion-resistant column trays for very different intended applications can be produced merely by choosing the superstructures and inserts adapted to the respective intended use, for example, superstructures of the types shown in the present Application, and possibly by changing the middle bore and optionally also closing the small bores according to the modular principle. This considerably reduces the costs of production and maintenance. In particular, the operator can cut costs by virtue of the fact that he need stock only one base tray as a spare part for various column trays, such as support trays, liquid distributors, liquid redistributors, liquid collectors and mass transfer trays.<br>
Thus, the present invention also relates to a tray for a column tray, the area of the tray being greater than or equal to the cross-section of the column, the tray having passages for receiving suitable internals adapted to the respective intended use of the column tray, and the tray being provided with a corrosion-resistant coating or a corrosion-resistant covering. Preferably, the tray is made flat and furthermore preferably enamelled or coated with a PTFE plastic.<br>
It is furthermore within the scope of the present invention separately to provide and to market superstructures for the retrofitting of trays according to the invention or optionally of suitable conventional trays, or for the conversion of existing trays for another purpose, so that the invention also relates to the production,  the provision  and  the marketing of individual  superstructures<br>
19<br><br>
adapted according to the invention, for example, of those made of plastic and glass, for the production of trays according to the invention by the end user.<br>
