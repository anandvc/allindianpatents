CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br><br>
[0001]       This is a utility application of prior pending provisional application serial numbered 60/507,575 filed October 1, 2003, an4 entitled "Method, System and Apparatus for Accessing Stored Spatial Data."<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION <br><br>
Field of the Invention<br><br>
[0002]       This invention relates to methods and systems for use in database systems.    In particular, the invention provides methods, apparatuses and systems for more effectively and efficiently accessing stored attributes and especially spatial data<br><br>
Prior Art<br><br>
[0003] Different database schemas often store spatial data in a proprietary manner. This previously made it impossible to generically access spatial data stored in a proprietary manner, for example, in order to show the data on a map. One would have to write database-specific code for each database schema and data type in order to access the spatial data. This is time consuming and inconvenient. For oil and gas software applications, such data types might include well point locations, well deviation surveys, and seismic lines, to name a few. Other (non-spatial) data is also sometimes stored in a proprietary manner and is subject to the same problems.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
[0004]       In view of the above problems, an object of the present invention is to provide methods, apparatuses and systems for accessing data, including but not limited to spatial data, even if stored in a proprietary manner, in a database, while eliminating or minimizing the impact of the problems and limitations described. The present invention provides an improved way of accessing stored spatial data or other attributes, even if stored in a proprietary manner.<br><br>
[0005]       The present invention includes creating an artificial attribute dynamically during run-time of the software "on the fly/' based on the meta-data description of how to create the shape object and the actual coordinate data ("spatial data") from the database.    The preferred embodiment of the invention includes an apparatus for accessing database attributes stored in a<br>
first database that includes a data access layer having a second database. The data access layer maps visible attributes to the database attributes.   The second database includes one or more artificial attributes, stored in meta data.   This preferred embodiment of the invention also includes an attribute pre-processing module.  The attribute pre-processing module scans a user request to see if the request includes the artificial attribute. The attribute pre-processing module creates an artificial attribute post processor, which can build a real attribute from a combination of the artificial attribute received from the attribute pre-processing module and a visible attribute received from the first database via the data access layer.  The artificial attribute may be spatial data, but is not so limited. The artificial attribute could be other types of data, such as a formula, or it could be used to derive a symbol code from other attributes.   After it builds the real attribute, the artificial attribute post processor sends the real attribute to an output. This could be any type of output and might, for example, include a display screen and/or a printer. If there is a<br>
plurality of artificial attributes, which is typical, they are stored within the second database by topic. Each artificial attribute preferably includes a usage rule that identifies the artificial attribute as artificial and describes a location where data is stored to build the artificial attribute into a real attribute. Each artificial attribute may also include a building block that describes the artificial attribute.<br><br>
[0006] Another preferred embodiment of the invention includes a method for accessing data stored in a first database. The data may be stored in a proprietary manner. The method includes receiving a request for stored data, scanning the request to see if the request seeks an artificial attribute stored in meta data on a second database, retrieving data required to build a requested artificial attribute into a real attribute and using the retrieved data to build the real attribute. The real attribute can be sent to an output, which might include a display or a printer. The artificial attribute includes a usage rule and at least one building block, specifying the location of the data to be retrieved to build the real attribute. The retrieved data preferably includes the artificial attribute. If there are a plurality of artificial attributes stored in meta data in the second database, the plurality of artificial attributes are preferably organized by topic. The artificial attribute is spatial data, but is not so limited. For example, the artificial attribute may be a formula or may be used to derive a symbol code from other attributes.<br><br>
[0007] Another preferred embodiment of the invention is a system for accessing database attributes stored in a first database, even if stored in a proprietary manner. The system includes a data access layer with a second database. The data access layer maps visible attributes to the database attributes. The second database has one or more artificial attributes, stored in meta data. The system also includes an attribute pre-processing module for scanning a user request to see if the request includes the artificial attribute, as well as an artificial attribute post processor created by the attribute pre-processor to be suitable for building a real attribute.  The artificial attribute post processor builds ttifc- real attribute from the artificial attribute received from the attribute pre-processing module and from a visible attribute received from the first database via the data access layer. The artificial attribute post processor sends the real attribute to an output, which may include, for example, a display screen and/or a printer. The artificial attribute may be a shape, but is not so limited. For example, it may be some other type of data such as a formula or may be used to derive a symbol code from other attributes. The artificial attribute may include a usage rule that identifies the artificial attribute as artificial and describes where data is stored to build the artificial attribute into a real attribute and may include one or more building blocks that describe the artificial attribute. If the system has a plurality of artificial attributes stored in meta data in the second database, they are preferably stored by topic. <br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br><br>
[00015] In the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments and other embodiments of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings. It is to be understood that those of ordinary skill in the art will readily see other embodiments and changes may be made without departing from the scope of the invention.<br><br>
[00016] An advantage of the present invention is that in order to access, for example, spatial data stored in a proprietary manner in a database, the spatial data having a shape, one describes in meta-data, that is, dynamically, where different components of the spatial data should come from. The invention provides for enabling code that reads the meta-data from the database. In this way, the description in meta-data can be modified by people configuring the software. For example, a user might describe in meta-data that the x coordinates of the shape should come from a database attribute called "location_x" and that the y coordinates should come from an attribute called "locationjy". In some cases, such as image generation, there might easily be twenty such components. The invention is not limited being applied to spatial data but can be applied to other types of data in a similar manner. The invention can be better understood by reference to the drawings.<br><br>
[00017] FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an overview of a system containing a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The system includes an input 40 for input from a user, a software system 12 and an output 75. These elements are discussed in more detail below in the discussion concerning FIG. 2.<br><br>
[00018] FIG. 2 provides a more detailed block diagram of a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Within the software system 12, a database-specific data access layer 10 defines database attributes of an entity (not depicted). An entity is an object to be created by the software system 12 (and may represent an object in the physical world). In oil and gas software applications, for example, a well may be an entity. Database attributes refer to aspects of the entity and are defined on a first database 20. Database attributes are typically stored in a table and are accessed from tables or database views. For example, if the entity is a well, database attributes in the first database may include its name, status, and location. Another type of attribute is a visible attribute 15 (depicted in FIG. 3). Visible attributes 15 are attributes that the user can physically perceive on a display. If an attribute is a well name and the user toggles on the attribute before executing a query, she will see the actual well name when the data is retrieved. Visible attributes 15 are stored in the data access layer 10.<br><br>
[00019] The database-specific data access layer 10 maps the visible attributes 15 to underlying database attributes 18 that are stored within the first database 20, which may be proprietary. Such database-specific data access layers 10 and associated first databases 20 are commercially available and are in use, for instance within oil and gas exploration companies. Exiamples of such database-specific data access layers 10 and first databases 20 include GeoQuest, GeoFrame, Landmark's OpenWorks and the ProSource Federator. Visible attributes 15 are often stored in such a way in order to hide the actual database implementation from an application that uses it, so the underlying first database 20 may be modified without having to modify every application that uses the first database 20. The data access layer 10 also includes a second database 21. <br><br>
[00020] In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, as illustrated in FIG. 3, an artificial attribute 30 is stored or "registered" in meta-data in the second database 21 in the database-specific data access layer 10. Referring to FIG. 3, the database-specific data access layer 10 and the second database 21 are organized by topics 16. For oil and gas applications, topics 16 may include, but are not limited to, wells 16a, logs 16b, seismic data 16c, etc. A topic 16 is an entity that, like the visible attribute 15, may be made visible to a user, such as in-a query interface. As depicted in to FIG. 33 there may be more than one artificial attribute 30a, 30b, 30c, 30d per topic 16 in the second database 21 of database-specific data access layer 10. The visible attributes 15 are also preferably stored by topic (although that detail is not depicted in FIG. 3). <br><br>
[00021] Referring again to FIG. 3, enabling code 31 that reads meta-data is also stored in the second database 21. The enabling code 31 supports read/insert/update/delete operations from the topics 16 which are defined in meta data and stored in the second database 21. <br><br>
[00022] The artificial attribute 30 is descriptive of its respective topic 16 in the way that attributes in general are descriptive of their entities. Taking a preferred embodiment of the invention where the artificial attribute 30 has a shape, the artificial attribute 30 is artificial in the sense that there is no direct underlying shape among the database attributes 18 stored in the database 20 that corresponds to the artificial attribute 30.<br><br>
[00023] Since the artificial attribute 30 is "visible" at the topic level, the artificial attribute 30 appears like any other "normal visible" attribute 15 to the user, even though the artificial attribute 30 (unlike visible attribute 15) does not exist directly in the database 20. The user may select the artificial attribute 30 like any other attribute (i.e. well name which is stored directly in the database 20),<br><br>
[00024] Referring to FIG, 4, which shows a representation of an artificial attribute 30, artificial attributes 30 are each flagged with a special text string, called a usage rule 11, that states that the attribute is an artificial attribute 30 (as opposed to a real attribute which also has some direct underlying database attribute in the database 20) and describes where the "real data" to create the artificial attribute 30 should come from. The usage rule 11 thus describes how to create the artificial attribute 30 from the real data.<br><br>
[00025]     Together with the artificial attribute 30 and usage rule 11, building blocks 13 for the artificial attribute 30 are also stored in the meta-data in the usage rule 11.   In the preferred embodiment where an artificial attribute 30 has a shape, the building blocks 13 are used to define the shape of the artificial attribute 30, for example, a point, a rectangle, a polyline, a polygon, an image etc.<br><br>
[00026]     For example, if an artificial attribute 30 is a point, the building blocks 13 that the artificial attribute would require would be determined geometrically, and in this case may include a "x attribute", a "y attribute" and a "coordinate system attribute."   If the artificial attribute is of a more complex shape type, such as a grid image, the artificial attribute 30 would<br>
likely need more building blocks 13.<br><br>
[00027]     Referring again to FIG. 2, the user through an input device 40, such as for example a keyboard or mouse, sends a request 45 for data to an attribute pre-processing module 50,  The user may want the data so that it can be displayed on a map for example, or so that it can be used in some other way. When the user requests data, the user does so by referencing an attribute that can be physically perceived by the user, such as visibly on a display screen (not depicted). The requested attribute could be a visible attribute 15 or artificial attribute 30.<br><br>
[00028]     The attribute pre-processing module 50 reviews the request 45 to determine whether an artificial attribute 30 is requested. To do this, the attribute pre-processing module 50 scans all attributes in the request 45 to see whether any of the requested attributes are an artificial attribute 30,   Meta data from the second database 21 in the database-specific data access layer 10 is loaded into the attribute pre-processing module 50.<br><br>
[00029]     If an artificial attribute 30 is requested, the attribute preprocessing module 50 instantiates, or creates, an artificial attribute post-processor 52 of the proper type, based on the artificial attribute meta data. For example, if the artificial attribute 30 is a poirfc artificial attribute, the attribute pre-processing module 50 will instantiate a point artificial attribute postprocessor 52, which knows how to create a point shape. Similarly, the attribute pre-processing module 50 will instantiate a polygon artificial attribute post-processor 52, which knows how to create polygons, if the artificial attribute 30 is a polygonal artificial attribute, or the attribute preprocessing module 50 will instantiate a formula attribute post-processor 52 if the artificial attribute 30 is a formula. Note that artificial attributes 30 are not only limited to shapes. The artificial attributes 30 can also be used for other types of data, such as formulas. For example: A true vertical depth (TVD) artificial attribute post-processor 52 can be used to compute the true vertical depth along a wellbore, given the building blocks 13 of a wellbore deviation survey (an array with xsy coordinates) and a measured depth (z) along the wellbore deviation survey. <br><br>
[00030] When it creates the artificial attribute post processor 52, the artificial attribute preprocessing module 50 feeds the artificial attribute 30, along with its usage rule 11 and its building blocks 13 into the artificial attribute post-processor 52. The attribute pre-processing module 50 sends a database request 60 to the database-specific data access layer 10 to retrieve from the database 20 the visible attributes 15 required for creating a real attribute 72 corresponding to the artificial attribute 30, using the artificial attribute's usage rule 11 and building blocks 13. The database-specific data access layer 10 retrieves the visible attributes 15 from the database 20 and then sends the retrieved visible attributes 15 to the artificial attribute post-processor 52. The artificial attribute post-processor 52 then creates the real attribute 72 corresponding to the artificial attribute 30 which the user wants to retrieve. The artificial attribute post-processor 52 replaces the artificial attribute 30 with the corresponding real attribute 72 in a return result set 74 (the complete set of data returned from the database), which is sent to the output 75. The return resufr set 74 sent to an output 75 may be displayed on a map or screen or printed out or may be used as input to another software module, such as a data transfer module.<br><br>
[00031] FIG. 5 depicts a flow schematic of a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The input from the end user 110 sends a data request 115 to the. attribute pre-processing module 120. The attribute pre-processing module 120 scans the data request 115 and if no artificial attributes are requested, does nothing further. If artificial attributes are requested, the attribute pre-processing module 120 creates an artificial attribute post-processor 130 and sends the artificial attribute 135 to the artificial attribute post-processor 130. The attribute pre-processing module 120 also sends a request 140 for visible attributes to the data access layer 145, which sends a query 150 to the database 160 and retrieves the visible attributes 165. The data access layer 145 sends the visible attributes 165 to the artificial attribute post-processor 130. The artificial attribute post-processor 130 uses the visible attributes 165 and the artificial attribute 135 to create corresponding real attributes 170, which are sent to the end user 110. <br><br>
[00032] The attribute pre-processor works independently of the data access layer, and works based on meta-data. This way data access to spatial data and other types of data and attributes may be provided for a database, without having to write any specific processing code for this database. This saves code and maintenance time, and it also enables supporting custom databases simply by defining where in the database the components of the data come from. [00033] In another aspect of the present invention, an artificial attribute may be used to derive a symbol code from other attributes. For example, the "well plot symbol" may be derived from the "well status code" attribute and the "well type" attribute. A well plot symbol processor could use the well status code and well type to look up the proper well plot symbol to use from a list of valid well plot symbols.<br><br>
[00034] FIG. 6 depicts a flow chart of a preferred embodiment of the present invention. An attribute pre-processing module receives 210 a data request. The attribute pre-processing module scans 220 the request to determine if an artificial attribute is requested. If the answer to the question 230 of whether an artificial attribute was requested is no, the attribute preprocessing module does nothing further 240. If an artificial attribute was requested, then the attribute pre-processing module creates 250 an artificial attribute post-processor, sends 252 the artificial attribute to the artificial attribute post-processor, and sends 254 a request for visible attributes to the data access layer. The data access layer sends 255 a query to the database for the database attributes. The data access layer identifies 260 the visible attributes mapped to the database attributes and sends 270 the visible attributes to the artificial attribute post-processor. The artificial attribute post-processor creates 275 real attributes from the visible attributes and the artificial attributes and sends 280 the real attributes to an output, which might include a display or printer. The process ends 290.<br><br>
