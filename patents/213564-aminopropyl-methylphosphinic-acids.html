COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"[AMINOPROPYL]METHYLPHOSPHINIC ACIDS"<br>
ASTRAZENECA AB, a Swedish company, of S- 151 85 Sodertalje, Sweden,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
The present invention is related to novel compounds having affinity to one or more GABAB receptors, as well as to their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates and stereoisomers. The invention is also related to processes for their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing said therapeutically active compounds and to the use of said active compounds in therapy.   <br>
Background and prior art Reflux<br>
Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is the most prevalent upper gastrointestinal tract disease. Current therapy has aimed at reducing gastric acid secretion, or at reducing oesophageal acid exposure by enhancing oesophageal clearance, lower oesophageal sphincter tone and gastric emptying. The major mechanism behind reflux has earlier been considered to depend on a hypotonic lower oesophageal sphincter. However recent research (e.g. Holloway &amp; Dent (1990) Gastroenterol. Clin. N. Amer.. J9, 517-535) has shown that most reflux episodes occur during transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations, hereinafter referred to as TLOSR, i.e. relaxations not triggered by swallows. It has also been shown that gastric acid secretion usually is norma] in patients with GORD.<br>
Consequently, there is a need for compounds which reduce the incidence of TLOSR and thereby prevent reflux.<br>
A pharmaceutical composition comprising a local anaesthetic, adapted to inhibit relaxation of the lower oesophageal sphicter is disclosed in WO 87/04077 and in US'5,036,057. Recently GAB AB-receptor agonists have been shown to inhibit TLOSR, as disclosed in WO 98/11885.<br><br>
GABAB receptor agonists<br>
GAB A (4-aminobutanoic acid) is an endogenous neurotransmitter in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Receptors for GABA have traditionally been divided into GABAA and GABAB receptor subtypes. GABAB receptors belong to the superfamily of G-protein coupled receptors. GABAB receptor agonists are being described as being of use in the treatment of CNS disorders, such as muscle relaxation in spinal spasticity, cardiovascular disorders, asthma, gut motility disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and as prokinetic and anti-tussive agents. GABAB receptor agonists have also been disclosed as useful in the treatment of emesis (WO 96/11680) and recently, as mentioned above, in the inhibition of TLOSR (WO 98/11885).<br>
The most studied GABAB receptor agonist is baclofen (4-amino-3-(chlorophenyl)butanoic acid) disclosed in the Swiss patent No. CH 449,046. Baclofen has for several years been used as an antispastic agent. EP 0356128 describes the use of the specific compound (3-aminopropyl)methylphosphinic acid, as a potent GABAB receptor agonist, in therapy. EP 0181833 discloses substituted 3-aminopropylphosphinic acids which are found to have very high affinities towards GABAB receptor sites. In analogy to baclofen, the compounds can be used as for instance muscle relaxants. EP 0399949 discloses derivatives of (3-aminopropyl)methylphosphinic acid which are described as potent GABAB receptor agonists. These compounds are stated to be useful as muscle relaxants. EP 0463969 and FR 2722192 are both applications related to 4-aminobutanoic acid derivatives having different heterocyclic substituents at the 3-carbon of the butyl chain. Structure-activity relationships of several phosphinic acid analogues with respect to their affinities to the GABAB receptor as well as their muscle relaxant effect are discussed in J. Med. Chem. (1995), 38, 3297-3312. The conclusion in said article is that considerably stronger muscle relaxation could be achieved with the (S)-enantiomer of 3-amino-2-hydroxy-propylmethylphosphinic acid than with baclofen and without the occurrence of unwanted CNS effects.<br><br>
Outline of the invention<br>
The present invention provides novel compounds of the formula I<br><br>
wherein<br>
R1 represents hydrogen, hydroxy, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy or halogen;<br>
R2 represents hydroxy, mercapto, halogen or an oxo group;<br>
R3 represents hydrogen or lower alky] (optionally substituted with hydroxy, mercapto, lower alkoxy, aryl or lower thioalkoxy);<br>
R4 represents hydrogen, lower alkyl (optionally substituted with aryl) or aryl;<br>
R5 represents methyl, fluoromethyl, difluoromethyl or trifluorormethyl;<br>
and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates and the stereoisomers thereof,<br>
with the exceptions of:<br>
i)   the racemate of (3-amino-2-hydroxypropyl)methylphosphinic acid, ii) (S)-(3-amino-2-hydroxypropyl)methylphosphinic acid, iii) (R)-(3-amino-2-hydroxypropyl)methyIphosphinic acid,<br><br>
iv) (3-amino-2-hydroxypropyl)difluoromethylphosphinic acid, and<br>
v)   (3-amino-2-oxopropyl)methylphosphinic acid.<br>
Preferrably the compound is one of (3-amino-2-fluoropropyl)(methyl)phosphinic acid, (2R)-(3-amino-2-fluoropropy])(rnethyl)phosphinic acid, (25)-(3-amino-2-fluoropropyl)(methyl)phosphinic acid, (3-amino-2-fluoro-l-<br>
methylpropyl)(methyl)phosphinic acid or pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates or the stereoisomers thereof.<br>
Within the scope of the invention, it is to be understood that when R2 is an oxo group the bond between R2 and the carbon is a double bond.<br>
Furthermore, within the scope of the invention, it is to be understood by "lower" radicals and compounds, for example, those having up to and including 7, especially up to and including 4, carbon atoms. Also the general terms have the following meanings:<br>
Lower alky] is, for example,C1-C4 alkyl, such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl or n-butyl, also isopropyl, isobutyl, secondary butyl or tertiary butyl, but may also be a C5-C7 alkyl group such as a pentyl, hexyl or heptyl group.<br>
Lower alkoxy is, for example, C1-C4 alkoxy, such as methoxy, ethoxy, n-propoxy or n-butoxy, also isopropoxy, isobutoxy, secondary butoxy or tertiary butoxy, but may also be a C5-C7 alkoxy group, such as a pentoxy, hexoxy or heptoxy group.<br>
Lower thioalkoxy is, for example, C1-C4 thioalkoxy, such as thiomethoxy, thioethoxy, n-thiopropoxy or n-thiobutoxy, also thioisopropoxy, thioisobutoxy, secondary thiobutoxy or tertiary thiobutoxy, but may also be a C5-C7 thioalkoxy group, such as a thiopentoxy, thiohexoxy or thioheptoxy group.<br><br>
Halogen is halogen of an atomic number up to and including 35, such as flourine or chlorine, and less prefered bromine.<br>
The compounds according to formula I of the invention are of amphoteric nature and may be presented in the form of internal salts'. They can also form acid addition salts and salts with bases. Such salts are particularly pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts, as well as pharmaceutically acceptable salts formed with bases. Suitable acids for the formation of such salts include, for example, mineral acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, or phosphoric acid or organic acids such as sulfonic acids and carboxylic acids. Salts with bases are, for example, alkali metal salts, e.g. sodium or potassium salts, or alkaline earth metal salts, e.g. calcium or magnesium salts as well as ammonium salts, such as those with ammonia or organic amines. The salts may be prepared by conventional methods.<br>
When one or more stereocentre is present in the molecule, the compounds according to formula I can be in the form of a stereoisomeric mixture, i.e. a mixture of diastereomers and/or racemates, or in the form of the single stereoisomers, i.e. the single enantiomer and/or diastereomer. The present compounds can also be in the form of solvates, e.g. hydrates.<br>
All of the compounds according to the formula I can be used for the inhibition of TLOSR, and thus for the treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. The said inhibition of TLOSR also implies that all of the compounds of formula I can be used for the treatment of regurgitation in infants. Effective management of regurgitation in infants would be an<br>
important way of managing failure to thrive due to excessive loss of ingested nutrient.<br>
Furthermore the novel compounds can be used for the treatment of GORD- or non-GORD<br>
related asthma, belching, coughing, pain, cocaine addiction, hiccups, IBS, dyspepsia,<br>
emesis and nociception.<br><br>
The present invention provides compounds having surprisingly high potencies and/or therapeutic index.<br>

The invention will now be described more in detail by the following examples which are not to be construed as limiting the invention.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1. (3-Amino-2-fluoropropyJ)(mefhvl)phosphinic acid<br><br>
Examples<br>
Example 1. (3-Amino-2-fluoropropvl)(rnethvI)phosphinic acid<br>
To a solution of BH3-THF (1 M, 22.2 mL, 22.2 mmol) at 0 °C was added a solution of ethyl (3-amino-2-fluoro-3-oxopropyl)(methyl)phosphinate (2.00 g, 10.1 mmol) in THF (15 mL). The resulting solution was heated to reflux for 2 h. The solution was cooled to room temperature and 6 N HC1 (60 mL) was added slowly. The THF was removed by evaporation in vacuo and another portion of 6 N HC1 (20 mL) was added. The solution was heated to reflux for 2.5 h, cooled to room temperature and evaporated. The residue was purified by ion-exchange chromatography (DOWEX® 50WX 8-200, H+ form, 3.5 x 4.0 cm). The resin was prewashed with 1:1 methanol/water (200 mL). The crude product was dissolved in 1:1 methanol/water and loaded onto the column. The column was washed with 1:1 methanol/water (400 mL). The eluent was changed to 2:1:1 methanol/water/concentrated ammonium hydroxide. Two fractions (150 mL) were combined and evaporated to give 1.28 g of a sticky oil. The residue was purified by chromatography on a wet-packed silica gel column (4 x 28 cm) eluting with 50:50:1 methanol/methylene chloride/ammonium hydroxide. The appropriate fractions were combined and evaporated to give 730 mg (46%) of (3-amino-2-<br>
fJuoropropyl)(methyl)pbosphinic acid as a white solid.   Data: mp 78-84 °C; Rf = 0.26 (60:40:1 methanol, methylene chloride, concentrated ammonium hydroxide); *H NMR (300 MHz, D20) 5 5.01 (dm, J= 49.5 Hz, 1H), 3.09-3.32 (m, 2H), 1.76-2.18 (m, 2H),i.28 (d,J = KHz); nC NMR (75 MHz, D20+ Dioxane) 5 91.3 (d, 7= 169 Hz), 47.1 (d,J=12 Hz), 37.2 (dd, J= 20.9, 89 Hz), 19.8 (d, J = 95 Hz); APIMS: m/z = 156 (M+H)+.<br>
Example 2. (3-Amino-2-fluoro-l-methvlpropvl)(methvl)phosphinic acid.<br>
To an ice bath cooled solution of ethyl 3-amino-2-fluoro-1-methyl-3¬ox opropyl(methyl)phosphinate (2.1 g, 10 mmol) in THF (25 ml) was. added 1 M BH3-THF (23 mL, 23 mmol) while under an argon atmosphere. After 10 minutes, the solution was heated to reflux for 2 h. The solution was cooled to room temperature and 6 N HC1 (30 mL) was added dropvise. The THF was removed by rotovap and another portion of 6 N<br><br>
HC1 (30 mL) was added. The mixture was refiuxed for 2 h and then stirred at room temperature over night. The solution was cooled, evaporated, co-evaporated with water and then with etanol. The residue was dissolved in methanol (25 mL) and then propyleneoxide (4 mL) was added dropvise. After 3 hours at room temperature the solution was concentrated and the product purified by chromatography on a wet-packed silica gel column eluting with water/methanol (2% - 4% water). The appropriate fractions were combined and evaporated to give an oil which precipitated when diethyl ether was added. The product was isolated by filtration and there was obtained 580 mg (35%) of a diastereomeric mixture of (3-amino-2-fluoro-l-methylpropyl)(methyl)phosphinic acid as a white solid. 'H NMR (400 MHz, D20) 64.8-5.2 (m, 1H), 3,2-3.5 (m, 2H), 1.8-2.2 (m, 1H), 1.0-1.3 (m, 6H); MS: m/z- 170 (M+H)+.<br>
Example 3. (2R)-(3-Amino-2-fluoropropvl)(methyl)phosphinic acid<br>
A suspension of compound (2R)-(3-amino-2-fiuoropropyl)phosphinic acid (1.0 g, 7.1 mmol) in HMDS (7.47 mL, 35.4 mmol) was heated to reflux for 16 h. The reaction was cooled to room temperature, treated with diglyme (8.0 mL) and heated to reflux for 6 h. After the mixture was cooled to room temperature , Hiinig's base (1.23 mL, 7.1 mmol) was added followed by dropwise addition of methyl iodide (1.32 mL, 21.2 mmol). The reaction was stirred for 23.5 h then it was diluted with methylene chloride and extracted with 2 N HC1 solution. The aqueous layer was washed with methylene chloride and diethyl ether and then evaporated under reduced pressure. The crude product was passed through a Dowex 50WX8-200 mesh H+ form column eluting with 1:1 methanol/water until no further material was detected by TLC analysis.

Pharmacol. 187, 27-38), was performed in 200 μl TCI (Tris Calcium Isoguvacine) buffer (50 mM Tris (tri(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane), pH 7.4, 2.5 mM CaC2 and 40 μM isoguvacine) containing 20 nM ['HJGABA (specific activity: 3 Tera Becquerel (TBq)/mmol), test compound or solvent and 80 μg synaptic membrane protein using 96-<br><br>
well plates. After incubation for 12-20 min at room temperature, incubations were terminated by rapid filtration through a glass fiber filter (Printed filtermat B filters, Wallac), which had been pretreated with 0.3% polyethyleneimine, using a 96-well plate cell harvester (Skatron or Tomtec). The filters were washed with buffer containing 50 mM Tris (tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane) and 2.5 mM CaCL, pH 7.4, at 4 °C and then dried at 55° C. MeltiLex B/HS scintillator sheet (Wallac) was melted onto the filter, and radioactivity was determined in a Microbeta scintillation counter (Wallac).<br>
Results and discussion<br>
The compounds of the present invention were found to have surprisingly high affinities and potencies for the GABAg receptor as revealed by low IC50 and EC50 in the binding and ileum assays, respectively. The potencies with regard to inhibition of TLOSR were related to the affinity for, and activity on, the GABAB receptor. CNS side-effects (as measured by reduction in body temperature in the mouse) were only seen at doses higher than the therapeutic doses inhibiting TLOSR in the dog model. Therefore, the difference between therapeutic dose (inhibition of TLOSR) and dose causing side-effects was unexpectedly high.<br><br>
