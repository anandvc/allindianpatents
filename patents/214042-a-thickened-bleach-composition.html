HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>

The  following  specification   particularly  describes  the   nature   of  the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to thickened cleaning compositions that comprise a bleaching agent for cleaning hard surfaces. The present invention particularly refers to cleaning compositions having bleaching agents that have surfactants which are widely and easily available and which can be thickened using inexpensive additives.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
Hard surfaces are encountered in most aspect of everyday life. These include surfaces in both non-industrial establishments like homes and offices and industrial establishments like factories. Hard surfaces in homes include floors, walls, ceilings, furnitures, kitchen utensils and cookware. Hard surfaces in offices and factories also include floors, walls, ceilings, furniture, equipments and instruments.<br>
Typically the hard surface constitutes ceramic, metals (e.g. stainless steel), stone, wood, vitreous enamel and chrome plated surfaces.<br>
Cleaning hard surfaces in all these variety of surfaces have been achieved using a variety of methods including physical methods like abrasion, chemical methods like use of surface active agents, solvents, bleaches, acids and alkalies and various combinations of the above methods.<br>
Surfactants are commonly used in most cleaning compositions for cleaning such surfaces. The compositions for cleaning hard surfaces are usually in the form of liquids, liquid abrasive cleaners, gels, pastes, powders or bars.<br>
2<br><br>
Cleaning compositions comprising bleaches have also been quite popular and useful in cleaning especially difficult-to-remove stains. Generally, the beaching action is as a result of the oxidative properties of free chlorine or oxygen that are liberated from the bleach compounds. To enhance cleaning, in addition to the bleaching action, many cleaning compositions include surface active agents like soaps and detergents in these bleach compositions.<br>
There has often been a need to thicken cleaning compositions comprising bleaches. Such thickened compositions are easier to dispense. Also, one desires that when these compositions are applied on to surfaces to be cleaned, the compositions are in contact with the surface for sufficiently long time to enable good cleaning action. This is especially significant when the compositions are applied underneath horizontal surfaces or to vertical or inclined surfaces.<br>
There have been many reported methods to thicken bleach compositions. The methods to thicken these compositions include use of polymers or by incorporating detergent actives in high quantities both of which are expensive options.<br>
US4839077 (1989, The Clorox Co.) describes a thickened bleach composition comprising (i) a bleaching halogen compound, (ii) a polymeric thickener having a molecular weight of one thousand to hundred thousand comprising a charged monomer and an uncharged monomer, such that the resulting polymer has a acid number between 80 to 400 mg KOH/g polymer and (iii) a surfactant system including a bleach resistant uncharged surfactant and a bleach-resistant anionic surfactant.<br>
3<br><br>
US5821214 (1998, Reckitt and Colman Inc.) describes a cleaning composition comprising (i) from 0.5 to 10% of soft abrasive particles (ii) from 0.5 to 2.5% of a chlorine containing bleach, (iii) from 0.2 to 3% of a thickening system comprising a crosslinked polyacrylate resin having a molecular weight in the range of I million to 10 million (iv) from 0.25 to 3% of a bleach stable surfactant system comprising mainly anionic surfactants and (v) sufficient amount of potassium or sodium hydroxide to provide a pH in the range of 11.5 to 13. 5.<br>
JP10251687 (1998, Kao Co. Ltd.) describes a liquid bleach composition for hard surface cleaning that comprises (i) 0.1 to 8% of alkali metal hypochlorite salt (ii) 0.1 to 9% of alkali metal hydroxide (iii\ Q.t to 5% of anionic surfactant and (iv), 0-1 to 5% of a buffer which is preferably phosphoric acid or its salts or soluble silicic acid salts.<br>
US6100228 (2000, The Clorox Co.) describes a bleaching gel cleaner and a method of preparing it comprising (i) an effective amount of a hypochlorite generating compound (ii) a ternary thickening system comprising (a) alkali metal soap; (b) a hydrotope consisting of trialkylamine oxides, betaines and mixtures thereof; and (iii) bleach stable solvent, and (iv) a buffer/electrolyte to stabilize the composition, the balance being water.<br>
The prior arts cited above teach methods to thicken bleach compositions utilizing compounds like polymers e.g. polyacrylates, non-ionic surfactants like amine oxides, soaps or a combination of the above. These compounds are expensive and it is desirable to develop methods to thicken bleach compositions using more easily and inexpensively available compounds and materials.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
All parts herein are by weight unless otherwise specified.<br>
The thickened bleach composition as per the invention essentially comprises one or more hypochlorite salts, one or more surfactants compatible with the bleaching agent and one or more electrolytes, along with water.<br>
Bleaching agent:<br>
The bleaching agent as per this invention is a hypochlorite salt. The hypochlorite salt is preferably an alkali metal hypochlorites. The alkali metal is chosen from sodium, potassium or lithium, more preferably sodium or potassium. Many commercially available solutions of alkali metal hypochlorites in water also include the alkali metal salt. This is due to the method of manufacture of alkali metal hypochlorites which constitutes reacting alkali metal hydroxides with chlorine gas to form the corresponding alkali metal hypochlorites and the alkali metal salts. These are often sold as such without further purification and are often called "high salt" bleach. E.g. if the alkali metal is sodium, the "high salt" sodium hypochlorite bleach solution also contains sodium chloride. It is also possible to source alkali metal hypochlorites which are free of the corresponding salt. Such products, often termed low salt" or "high purity" bleaches are prepared by reaction<br>
6<br><br>
of alkali metal hydroxide with hypochlorous acid. It is possible to prepare the thickened bleach composition of the present invention starting with1 either of the so called "high salt" or "low-salt" bleaches. A particularly preferred bleaching agent of the present invention is sodium hypochlorite due to its wide availability and I  It is also preferred that<br>
the "high salt" form of the commercially available sodiuni hypochlorite bleach solution be used in the present invention as it is more widely and cheaply available compared to the corresponding "low-salt" solutions.<br>
The thickened bleach composition as per the invention comprises bleaching agent from 0.1 to 10%, preferably from 0.1 to 8 %, and most preferably 0.1 to 5% by weight of the composition.<br>

derived from coconut oil and tallow; primary and secondary alkyl sulphonates (PAS and SAS); olefin sulphonates; and higher alkyl sulphates, and the higher fatty acid monoglyceride sulphates and mixtures thereof.<br>
The preferred anionic surfactant are water-soluble salts of organic sulphuric acid mono-esters and sulphonic acids having in the molecular structure a branched or straight chain alkyl group containing 8-22 C atoms or an aryl or alkylaryl group containing 8-22 C atoms.<br>
Particularly preferred anionic surface active compounds for use in the present invention is SLES (sodium lauryl ether sulphate - ethoxylate derivative) and primary and secondary alkyl sulphonates.<br>
It is also possible to include nonionic, cationic, amphoteric, or zwitterionic detergent actives in the compositions according to the invention<br>
The detergent actives used in the detergent composition of the invention could also be chosen from the detergent active compounds given in the well-known textbooks "Surface Active Agents", Volume I by Schwartz and Perry and "Surface Active Agents and Detergents", Volume II by Schwartz, Perry and Berch.<br>
The thickened bleach composition as per the invention comprises one or more surfactants compatible with the bleaching agent and is incorporated from 0.5 to 20% by weight of the composition, preferably from 0.5 to 10 % by weight of the composition.<br>

The preferred alkali metal cation is sodium or potassium. Preferred electrolytes include alkali metal hydroxides, chlorides, sulphates and mixtures thereof. It is preferred that the cation of at least one electrolyte is different from the cation of one of the alkali metal hypochlorite, e.g. when the alkali metal hypochlorite is sodium hypochlorite, then one of the electrolyte could be potassium hydroxide, potassium chloride, lithium hydroxide and the like. It is preferred that the mole percent of the cation of the electrolyte that is different from the cation of the alkali metal hypochlorite is at least 10% of the total moles of cations of the electrolytes and cations of the alkali metai hypochlorita E.g. when the bleaching agent is sodium hypochlorite and the electrolytes used are potassium chloride and potassium hydroxide then it is preferred that the mole percent of potassium ion from potassium chloride and potassium hydroxide is at least 10 mole percent of the total moles of potassium and sodium present in the system from the electrolytes and the bleaching agent. It is also preferred that the electrolytes are so chosen to ensure that the pH of the thickened bleach composition is at least 11 and more preferred that it is at least 12.5.<br>
It is also possible that when "high-salt" alkali metal hypochlorites are used, there is some amount of electrolyte in the form of the corresponding alkali metal chloride present in the composition.<br>
