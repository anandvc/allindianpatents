				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention concerns with a top knot cap (headgear provided with a ponytail) that performs multiple functions, such as convenient movement of head up and down and assurance of ventilation inside the cap, as well as increase of ear function, protection of neck and insulation of heat outside the cap.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Generally speaking, the shape of a cap varies according to use and function. Most of caps are composed of the crown that covers the head and the visor that cuts off the light from the sun. Some kind of cap, such as hunting cap, is equipped with the ear flaps to protect the ears in winter time. However, most of the caps are prepared for a simple function.<br>
Speaking more in details;<br>
Problems neglected in composing the caps so far are preparation of enough space up to the summit of crown for the convenient movement of head up and down and assurance of ventilation inside the cap, as well as protection of face, method of attaching the ear flap to increase the ear function and neck cover to protect the neck outside the cap. Among the cap makers, such problems have not been considered important so far.<br>
The matter of head movement up and down inside the crown of cap is important to level up the status of ready-made cap, currently produced in a number of standard patterns, to that of a cap made to measurement. In an attempt to adjust standard-size caps to the heads of varied sizes as if they are made to measurement, flexibility devices are provided at the back edge of cap, to attain the effect of free-size caps. On the<br><br>
assumption that the relative- height of head following the size of head is_ proportionate   to   the   size   of   edge,   the   relative   height   was   thought adjustable by adjusting the size of edge. However, in producing the caps, the relative height of crown  of cap is ready made in certain patterns while only the edges are made adjustable. Therefore at the actual use of cap,  the  problem  of relative  height  becomes   outstanding   unexpectedly. Sometimes the edge of cap comes down to touch the wearer's ear,  or sometimes it remains too high from the level of one's ear so that the cap might be blown away by the wind. To solve such shortcomings, the depth of cap should have a system of adjustment as the back edge of cap is equipped with the flexibility device. For this object, the summit of crown needs to be elastic to assure the space for head movement. So   far,   the   problems   of   ventilation   and   change   of   air   have   been underestimated, and a few number of little holes on the crown were not enough to satisfy the absolute quantity of air. Such underestimation came probably from the fact that the cap is easier to be taken off than the shoes are, though keeping the cap in one's hand is inconvenient. So, it is actual that taking hat off is difficult while taking  shoes off is not so difficult. It is indeed inside the cap that the health principle of keeping head cool and feet warm is neglected. Therefore the entire cap should be remodelled to improve the volume of ventilation.<br>
The neck cover was attached for protection of skin in the summer and for prevention of cold air in the winter. However, one stretch of thick cloth was stitched into the edge of cap without distinction of neck or ear cover while it was actually both for neck and ear. As it is unable to equip the back edge of cap with flexibility device, the result was the unpleasant feeling coming from tight contact of cap with the skin. Also, the up-lifted neck cover when not in use and the unusual thickness of edge due to the stitch-in of neck cover decreased the beauty point.<br><br>
In consideration of those problems as mentioned so far, the author invented a top knot cap (headgear provided with ponytail) composed of the top knot function added to the existing cap and had it registered for a number of design rights and utility model rights.<br>
However, there exist various problems, such as limitation in expressing the designs of cap by connecting the knot portion and in the degree of utilization, while the summit of top knot portion connected to the crown of cap was made to be bound or unfastened by the use of binding cord, showing the function of opening or closing the summit of cap.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
The top knot portion of the present invention is usually bound by the cord to form the top knot, and when unfurled, it turns out to cover face, ear, neck and even the cap itself. This top knot cap is purposed to protect the human body, performing multiple functions as well as exhibiting varied designs.<br>
To realize the object of the present invention as mentioned so far, it is characteristic of the following designs.<br>
A top knot cap(Headgear provided with pony tail) characterized in that the top knot portion(ZO) connected to the crown(lO) comprises the upper top knot portion(22) that becomes the cover when puckered up, and that it may be lowered in a state of being bundled by the binding cord(32) or may be unfurled to become the neck cover. The binding cord (31) equipped at the summit of top knot portion(20).<br>

Best example of the invention in actual use<br>
Following the accompanying drawings hereunder, best examples of the present   invention in actual use are explained as follows;<br>
Fig 1 is the fundamental design of the present invention.<br>
The top knot portion (20) is connected to the round line appropriately located on the crown of cap, and the binding cord (31) is located at the position where the top knot portion (20) is to be puckered to come together, thus forming the binding portion (30). Further the upper top knot portion (22) for neck-cover function is formed by extending the lower top knot portion (20) to the length of reaching down farther than the edge of crown of cap (10) when unfurled.<br>
Vertically on the front side of top knot portion (20), the open/close line (23) is formed so that the top knot portion can be opened, and as the materials (24) for the open/close line, buttons are depicted. Cord and zipper also can replace the buttons for the open/close line materials (24)<br><br>
of the meeting and parting portion (-23). For the top knot portion (20) to be connected to or disconnected from<br>
the crown of cap,  such materials  (11)  as zipper,  buttons,  cord,  or link<br>
can be used. The open/close line (23) on the top knot portion  (20) may be made in<br>
double   or   more   on   the  entire  portion   or  partial   portion   of  top   knot<br>
portion (20) either vertically or horizontally. Code 40 is an interior cover (summit) for covering the open portion of<br>
crown,  appearing inside the connection portion between the crown  (10)<br>
and the top knot portion (20). While it is sketched in a network style, it<br>
is not a required part of the present   invention but a selective one.<br>
So far, the top knot portion (20) is to be stitched or connected to the crown (10) by using the materials (11) of fixing or removing function. Now another method is to have the crown itself (10), without having the necessity of connecting the top knot portion to it, extended to the length of reaching farther down than the edge line of crown (10) when unfurled, to form the upper top knot portion of neck-cover function (22).<br>
As such , method of connecting top knot portion includes extending the crown (10).<br>
The code 50 is a visor.<br>
Fig 2 shows the state of top knot bound on the cap.<br>
When the top knot portion (20) is puckered up and bound by the binding cord (31), the extended upper top knot portion (22) looks like a pony tail flowing down farther than the edge of cap. To prevent the upper top knot portion from swinging left and right, cord (32) located at the back of crown (10) may bind the down-flowing upper top knot portion (22).<br>
When the top knot portion (20) is to be applied to the sun visor and connected to its band, the fixed cord of top knot portion can be set at<br><br>
the upper top knot portion (22) beside the binding cord (31)<br>
Cord (32) is of many types, such as encircling cord, cord hidden inside the top knot portion,  another exterior ring, exterior binding  cord  or  so<br>
forth.  Especially  the  materials   for  woman   to   bind  their hair,   such   as rubber ring clip, and so forth may be used for such purpose. Also, as method of connecting or removing the top knot portion (20) to and from the crown (10), punchings may be made on the upper edge of crown and bottom edge of top knot portion so that the connection may be made by the use of rings though the punchings.<br>
As materials of top knot portion (20), artificial hair and versatile ways of binding them, such as dividing them in a number of lines as can be seen in the fashion styles, may be used. In each hair-making pattern, ornament or artful cover may be used as a character article, for an instance, a dragon symbol.<br>
Fig 3 is the state of top knot portion of Fig 2 unfurled down. When the binding cord  (31) is unfastened,  the open/close line  (23)  will be opened by the use of open/close line materials (24), and then the top knot portion (20) will be unfurled down with the inside turned out. Then the upper top knot portion (22) extended from the top knot portion  (20) will come down farther to perform the neck cover function.    Also as the top  knot  portion   (20)  gets  unfurled  to  the  outside  of crown   (10),   the interior cover (summit) equipped at the connection line of crown (10) and top knot portion  (20) appears open to the outside air, and performs its ventilation function through the network. Also, the quantity of ventilation may be adjusted by the degree of opening the top knot portion. Further,    beside    the   neck   cover   function,    attachable   to   the   place appropriate  to  the  ear  are  such  communication   systems  as  ear phone (60),   sound  reflection  appliance,   or  noise-prevention   set-up  which   will assist the wearer indirectly to direct his attention forward. Also   as   the   materials   of   top   knot   portion    (20),   those   of   specific functions, such as vinyl instead of natural fiber or synthetic fiber, maybe<br>
used for the purpose of multiple functions, such-as water-proof, cutting off ultra-violet ray or electric wave and so on. The interior or the exterior side of top knot portion may also be used for placing the sun ray condenser or the printed advertisement.<br>
Fig 4 illustrates the case of top knot cap without the interior cover (summit). In case of the close interior cover equipped at the upper edge of crown (10), the top knot portion (20) can only be spread down to the outside of the crown while in case of no interior cover or open interior cover, the top knot portion may be spread either to the outside or to the inside of crown.<br>
Fig 5 shows the state of ring set up at the rolled-up top knot portion of cap. Top knot portion (20) is rolled-up and fixed by the cord (33) attached at the inside of crown and the corresponding button attached at the outside of crown, so the upper portion of cap gets open. Further another cord (34) fixed inside the rolled-up top knot portion (20) binds and fixes the ring (70) that supports the crown (10) and the interior cover (Flat top).<br>
To the ring (70) mentioned above, either a network cloth or cloth with open/close  line   on  it  shall   be  connected   so  that   it  may  perform  the function of interior cover (summit) as well as ventilation. Fig 6 shows the state of top knot portion (20) folded and bundled up by the binding cord. It is characteristic of the extended upper top knot portion  (22)  folded and bundled up together with the first one to form one top knot. As the materials (24) for open/close line (23), either zipper or cord is used. In case of cord,  it is  depicted as  intertwining through the punctures. And the top knot portion (20) is connected to the crown (10)   by   a   cord   (11)   running   in   a   zigzag   form   through   the   holes punctured   along   the  connecting  line   up  and  down   and  connecting  or disconnecting the top knot portion to or from the crown.<br>
Fig 7-9 is the state of pony tail top knot type applied to the safari cap.<br>
As in the Fig 2, the upper top knot portion (22) of top knot portion (20)<br>
connected to the safari cap is further extended to reach the lower back<br>
part of cap and bound by the cord.<br>
Fig 8 is  the  state of upper top knot portion  (22) folded and bundled<br>
together with the top knot portion (20) into one top knot, like in the Fig<br>
6.<br>
Fig 9 shows the state of the binding cord (31) applied to the safari cap<br>
and unfastened. When the top knot portion (20) is made to run down with the inside turning out, the upper top knot portion (22) reaches down to the neck position and performs the neck-cover function.<br>
As mentioned so far, the function of top knot of the present    invention can also be applied to various caps as seen in the case of safari cap.<br>
Fig 10 shows the state of double top knots applied to the cap.<br>
For connecting the top knot portion (20) to the crown of cap, top knot portions (20a) (20b) are prepared in double to be connected to the crown, with the interior top knot portion (20a) the longer and the exterior top knot portion (20b) the shorter, and the knot portion formed by the puckering to form the knot is bound by the cord (21).<br>
The interior top knot portion (20a) performs the function of neck cover. It can be spread both to the inside and to the outside of crown (10) and when it is spread to the inside, the exterior top knot portion (20b) still can perform the function of ventilation and exterior cover. Cap wearer may decide how to use, selectively.<br>
Or the interior top knot portion (20a) may be made shorter, and the exterior top knot portion (20b) the longer and in this case, an interior cover made of network cloth may be attached to the inside of the interior top knot portion (20a) so that it may contain various kind of necessary things in the space between, to perform the function of pocket.<br>
At this time, the exterior-top knot portion (20b) may be made to spread to the outside of crown (10). This double top knot portions as such belong to the fundamental invention to advance the practical and aesthetic value of top knot portion.<br>
In the Fig 11, the open/close line (23) is not formed on the top knot portion  (20).  Instead,  the  knot portion  connected  to  the  crown   (10)   is made long enough to cover the neck when unfurled, and in this case, the diameter of top knot portion  gets  wider as it goes upward  so that it may be readily pulled down to the level of neck,  uninterrupted by the visor. To prevent the interruption by the visor when the top knot portion is to be pulled down with the inside turned out, the front part of it may be made shorter while the back part the longer, so that the front part may be stopped at the visor. For the top knot portion of wool cap for winter, hole may be prepared to let the visor and face come out of the top knot portion spread. While the binding cord is attached like a link at the backside of top knot portion  (20), it may be changed according to necessity.<br>
Fig 12 shows the partable open/close line(23) formed perpendicularly on the top knot portion(20) where the binding cord(31) is equipped to bind the puckered up summit portion connected to the crown(lO) of cap, providing the function of top knot portion (20) to become a cover when bound and to ventilate when unfurled.<br>
Fig 12 is a small type of top knot portion (20) formed by combining the open/close line to the top knot portion (20), and when applied to the sun cap(visors), it can be used as the neck cover shown in Fig 4.<br>
Industrial Availability<br>
Diverse -functions  of  the  present     invention  of  top  knot  cap   can   be brought forth by simple handling. When the top knot portion is opened, ventilation and the space necessary for the movement of head up and down inside the cap can be assured and further, with the interior cover (40) and the open/close line, their quantity and degree can be adjusted. When the unfurled top knot portion gets puckered up and bound, or the spread down top knot portion gets bound, it becomes either a top cap or a  fashionable pony  tail  cap.  When  the top knot portion  gets  unfurled down  to the inside,  or to  the outside,  it will have diverse  utilities  of protecting   face,   ears,   eyes,   or  even   the  neck.   Not  only   such  diverse functions,   the  utility  of  cap  will   be  heightened  greatly   when   various designs are attached to it. Also in accordance with the use of selected functional materials for the top knot portion, it will perform the functions of water-prevention, electron wave prevention, ultra-violet ray prevention and   so   forth.   With   fixing   communication   system   or   advertisement materials to the cap, it can meet the requirements of information age.<br><br><br><br><br>
