				<td>ULTRASONIC MEDICAL INSTRUMENT AND<br>
MEDICAL INSTRUMENT CONNECTION ASSEMBLY<br>
[0001] Field of the Invention<br>
[0002] The present invention is related generally to medical instruments, and<br>
more particularly to an ultrasonic medical instrument and to a medical-<br>
instrument connection assembly.<br>
[0003] Background of the Invention<br>
[0004] Medical instruments are known which include a handpiece and a<br>
medical ultrasonic blade assembly. The handpiece contains an ultrasound<br>
transducer. The ultrasonic blade of the assembly makes physical contact with,<br>
and is connected to, the handpiece of the assembly only by a threaded<br>
connection (internal threads on the blade and external threads on the handpiece)<br>
proximate a vibration antinode. This requires multiple turns to attach the blade,<br>
requires a torque-limiting device to correctly attach me blade, and is prone to<br>
threads being stripped or broken. Quick connections are known which had the<br>
blade contact the handpiece at a vibration antinode but provided the force to<br>
hold the two members together at a -vibration node. This did not work reliably<br>
over a wide range of inputs and was not implemented.<br>
[0005] Still, scientists and engineers continue to seek improved handpiece and<br>
medical ultrasonic blade assemblies and improved medical-instrument<br>
connection assemblies.<br>
[0006] Summary of the Invention<br>
[0007] A first expression of an embodiment of the invention is for an<br>
ultrasonic medical instrument having a handpiece and medical ultrasonic blade<br>
assembly. The handpiece and medical ultrasonic blade assembly includes a<br><br>
vibration antinode, a handpiece and a medical ultrasonic blade. The medical<br>
ultrasonic blade is threadably engaged by the handpiece proximate the vibration<br>
antinode. The medical ultrasonic blade is in ultrasound-transmitting physical<br>
contact with the handpiece proximate the vibration antinode and apart from<br>
where the medical ultrasonic blade is threadably engaged by the handpiece.<br>
[0008] A second expression of an embodiment of the invention is for a<br>
medical-instrument connection assembly for transmitting ultrasonic vibrations<br>
and includes-an ultrasound-medical-instrument first connecting member, an<br>
ultrasound-medical-instrument second connecting member, and an ultrasound-<br>
medical-instrument third connecting member. The first connecting member is<br>
adapted to be ultrasonically vibrated and has a longitudinal axis. The second<br>
connecting member is capable of being positioned to be substantially coaxially<br>
aligned with the longitudinal axis and in ultrasound-transmitting physical<br>
contact with the first connecting member. The third connecting member<br>
surrounds, and is rotatably or fixedly attached to, the second connecting<br>
member and is threadably engageable with the first connecting member.<br>
[0009] Several benefits and advantages are obtained from one or more of the<br>
expressions of an embodiment of the invention. In one example, physical<br>
contact and threadable engagement (internal threads on the handpiece acting on<br>
the external diameter of the blade) proximate a longitudinal vibration antinode<br>
provide improved ultrasound transfer while threadable engagement radially<br>
apart from the physical contact allows for a quick connection (and<br>
disconnection) without requiring multiple turns or a torque limiting device<br>
while reducing the possibility of stripped or broken threads.<br>
[0010] The present invention has, without limitation, application with straight<br>
or curved ultrasonic surgical blades and further in hand-activated instruments as<br>
well as in robotic-assisted instruments.<br>
[0011] Brief Description of the Figures<br><br>
[0012] FIGURE 1 is a schematic cross-sectional view of a first embodiment<br>
of an ultrasonic medical instrument of the invention, including an embodiment<br>
of a medical-instrument connection assembly of the invention, wherein the<br>
handpiece makes a tapered physical contact with the wave guide portion of the<br>
blade, and wherein the third connecting member is fixedly attached to the<br>
second connecting member; and<br>
[0013] FIGURE 2 is a schematic cross-sectional view of a second<br>
embodiment of an ultrasonic medical instrument of the invention, including an<br>
embodiment of a medical-instrument connection assembly of the invention,<br>
wherein the handpiece makes a non-tapered physical contact with the end<br>
effector portion of the blade, and wherein the third connecting member is<br>
rotatably attached to the second connecting member.<br>
[0014] Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
[0015] Before explaining the present invention in detail, it should be noted<br>
that the invention is not limited in its application or use to the details of<br>
construction and arrangement of parts illustrated in the accompanying drawings<br>
and description. The illustrative embodiments of the invention may be<br>
implemented or incorporated in other embodiments, variations and<br>
modifications, and may be practiced or carried out in various ways.<br>
Furthermore, unless otherwise indicated, the terms and expressions employed<br>
herein have been chosen for the purpose of describing the illustrative<br>
embodiments of the present invention for the convenience of the reader and are<br>
not for the purpose of limiting the invention.<br>
[0016] It is understood that any one or more of the following-described<br>
embodiments, examples, etc. can be combined with any one or more of the<br>
other following-described embodiments, examples, etc.<br>
[0017] Referring now to the Figures, in which like numerals indicate like<br>
elements, Figure 1 illustrates a first embodiment of the invention. A first<br>
expression of the embodiment of Figure 1 is for an ultrasonic medical<br><br>
instrument 8 having a handpiece and medical ultrasonic blade assembly 10.<br>
The handpiece and medical ultrasonic blade assembly 10 includes a vibration<br>
antinode 16, a handpiece 12, and a medical ultrasonic blade 14. The medical<br>
ultrasonic blade 14 is threadably engaged by the handpiece 12 proximate the<br>
vibration antinode 16. The medical ultrasonic blade 14 is in ultrasound-<br>
transmitting physical contact with the handpiece 12 proximate the vibration<br>
antinode 16 and apart from where the medical ultrasonic blade 14 is threadably<br>
engaged by the handpiece 12.<br>
[0018] In one enablement of the first expression of the embodiment of Figure<br>
1, the handpiece 12 includes an ultrasound transducer 18, the vibration antinode<br>
16 is a longitudinal vibration antinode, and the medical ultrasonic blade 14 is in<br>
ultrasound-transmitting physical contact with the handpiece 12 transversely<br>
apart (such as radially apart in the case of a circularly cylindrical blade) from<br>
where the medical ultrasonic blade 14 is threadably engaged by the handpiece<br>
12. It is noted that the term "proximate" includes, without limitation, the word<br>
"at". Other enablements, including handpieces which transfer ultrasound<br>
vibration from an ultrasound transducer located remote from the handpiece, and<br>
including non-longitudinal vibrational modes, are left to those skilled in the art.<br>
It is noted that electrical connections to the handpiece (such as a cable from a<br>
generator outside the handpiece to the ultrasound transmitter inside the<br>
handpiece) and fluid connections to the handpiece have been omitted from<br>
Figure 1 for clarity.<br>
[0019] In one arrangement of the first expression of the embodiment of Figure<br>
1, the medical ultrasonic blade 14 includes a first connecting member 20 having<br>
a longitudinal axis 22. In this arrangement, the handpiece 12 includes a second<br>
connecting member 24 which is substantially coaxially aligned with the<br>
longitudinal axis 22 and which is in ultrasound-transmitting physical contact<br>
with the first connecting member 20 proximate the vibration antinode 16. In<br>
this arrangement, the handpiece 12 includes a third connecting member 26<br>
which surrounds, and is rotatably or fixedly attached to, the second connecting<br><br>
member 24 and which is threadably engaged with the first connecting member<br>
20 proximate the vibration antinode 16.<br>
[0020] In one construction of the first expression of the embodiment of Figure<br>
1 having the connecting-member arrangement, the first connecting member 20<br>
is a monolithic portion of the medical ultrasonic blade 14. In one variation, the<br>
handpiece 12 includes an ultrasound transducer 18 and a protrusion 28<br>
operatively connected to the ultrasound transducer 18. In one modification, the<br>
second connecting member 24 is a monolithic portion of the protrusion 28. In<br>
one example, the third connecting member 26 is fixedly attached to the second<br>
connecting member 24 by being a monolithic portion of the protrusion 28.<br>
Non-monolithic members and their attachments are left to the artisan.<br>
[0021] In a first application of the first expression of the embodiment of<br>
Figure 1 having the connecting-member arrangement, the first connecting<br>
member 20 includes a substantially longitudinally-facing surface 30 having a<br>
tapered recess 32, and the second connecting member 24 has a tapered end 34<br>
engaged in the tapered recess 32. The taper of the tapered recess 32 is greater<br>
than the taper of the tapered end 34 to insure ultrasound-transmitting physical<br>
contact In one variation, the first connecting member 20 has a substantially<br>
transversely-outwardly-extending annular wing 36, and the third connecting<br>
member 26 has internal threads 38 threadably engaging the annular wing 36. In<br>
one modification, the first connecting member 20 has a first lumen 40, and the<br>
second connecting member 24 has a second lumen 42 in fluid communication<br>
with the first lumen 40. In one employment, liquid is transmitted to patient<br>
tissue through the first and second lumens 40 and 42. In one example, the first,<br>
second and third connecting members 20,24 and 26 together define a luer-type<br>
connection.<br>
[0022] In a second application, as shown in the embodiment of the handpiece<br>
and medical ultrasonic blade assembly 110 of Figure 2, the first connecting<br>
member 120 includes a substantially longitudinally-facing flat surface 130, and<br>
the second connecting member 124 has a substantially longitudinally-facing flat<br><br>
surface 131 abuttingly engaging the substantially longitudinally-facing flat<br>
surface 130 of the first connecting member 120. In one variation, the first<br>
connecting member 120 has a substantially transversely-outwardly-extending<br>
annular wing 136, and the third connecting member 126 has internal threads<br>
138 threadably engaging the annular wing 136. In one modification, the first<br>
connecting member 120 has a first lumen 140, and the second connecting<br>
member 124 has a second lumen 142 in fluid communication with the first<br>
lumen 140.<br>
[0023] In one configuration of the first expression of the embodiment of<br>
Figure 1, the medical ultrasonic blade 14 includes a proximal wave guide<br>
portion 44 and a distal end effector portion 46, and the proximal wave guide<br>
portion 44 is threadably engaged by the handpiece 12. In a second<br>
configuration, as shown in the second embodiment of Figure 2, the medical<br>
ultrasonic blade 114 includes an end effector portion 146, and the end effector<br>
portion 146 is threadably engaged by the handpiece 112. In one variation, the<br>
handpiece 112 includes an ultrasound transducer 118.<br>
[0024] A second expression of the embodiment of Figure 1 is for a medical-<br>
instrument connection assembly 48 for transmitting ultrasonic vibrations and<br>
includes an ultrasound-medical-instrument first connecting member 20, an<br>
ultrasound-medical-instrument second connecting member 24, and an<br>
ultrasound-medical-instrument third connecting member 26. The first<br>
connecting member 20 is adapted to be ultrasonically vibrated and has a<br>
longitudinal axis 22. The second connecting member 24 is disposable to be<br>
substantially coaxially aligned with the longitudinal axis 22 and in contact with<br>
the first connecting member 20. The third connecting member 26 surrounds,<br>
and is rotatably or fixedly attached to, the second connecting, member 24 and is<br>
threadably engageable with the first connecting member 20. In one example,<br>
one or more of the connecting members 20, 24 and 26 is operatively connected<br>
to, or a monolithic portion of, a medical ultrasonic blade 14, and in another<br>
example, not shown, there is no medical ultrasonic blade present.<br><br>
[0025] In a first employment of the second expression of the embodiment of<br>
Figure 1, a medical ultrasonic blade 14, of a handpiece and medical ultrasonic<br>
blade assembly 10 of an ultrasonic medical instrument 8, includes the first<br>
connecting member 20, and a handpiece 12, of the handpiece and medical<br>
ultrasonic blade assembly 10, includes the second and third connecting<br>
members 24 and 26. In a second employment, not shown, a handpiece, of a<br>
handpiece and medical ultrasonic blade assembly of an ultrasonic medical<br>
instrument, includes the first connecting member, and a medical ultrasonic<br>
blade, of the handpiece and medical ultrasonic blade assembly; includes the<br>
second and third connecting members.<br>
[0026] In a first application of the second expression of the embodiment of<br>
Figure 1, the first connecting member 20 includes a substantially longitudinally-<br>
facing surface 30 having a tapered recess 32, and the second connecting<br>
member 24 has a tapered end 34 engaged in the tapered recess 32. The taper of<br>
the tapered recess 32 is greater than the taper of the tapered end 34 to insure<br>
ultrasound-transmitting physical contact. In one variation, the first connecting<br>
member 20 has a substantially transversely-outwardly-extending annular wing<br>
36, and the third connecting member 26 has internal threads 38 threadably<br>
engaging the annular wing 36. In one modification, the first connecting<br>
member 20 has a first lumen 40, and the second connecting member 24 has a<br>
second lumen 42 in fluid communication with the first lumen 40. In one<br>
example, the first, second and third connecting members 20, 24 and 26 together<br>
define a luer-type connection.<br>
[0027] In a second application, as shown in the embodiment of the medical-<br>
instrument connection assembly 148 of Figure 2, the first connecting member<br>
120 includes a substantially longitudinally-facing flat surface 130, and the<br>
second connecting member 124 has a substantially longitudinally-facing flat<br>
surface 131 abuttingly engaging the substantially longitudinally-facing flat<br>
surface 130 of the first connecting member 120. In one variation, the first<br>
connecting member 120 has a substantially transversely-outwardly-extending<br>
annular wing 136, and the third connecting member 126 has internal threads<br><br>
138 threadably engaging the annular wing 136. In one modification, the first<br>
connecting member 120 has a first lumen 140, and the second connecting<br>
member 124 has a second lumen 142 in fluid communication with the first<br>
lumen 140.<br>
[0028] Several benefits and advantages are obtained from one or more of the<br>
expressions of an embodiment of the invention. In one example, physical<br>
contact and threadable engagement (internal threads on the handpiece acting on<br>
the external diameter of the blade) proximate a longitudinal vibration antinode<br>
provide improved ultrasound transfer while threadable engagement radially<br>
apart from the physical contact allows for a quick connection (and<br>
disconnection) without requiring multiple turns or a torque limiting device<br>
while reducing the possibility of stripped or broken threads.<br>
