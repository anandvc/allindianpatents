N-FORMYL HYDROXYLAMINE COMPOUNDS AS INHIBITORS OF PDF<br>
This invention is directed to novel N-fomnyl hydroxylamine compounds, to the uses of these compounds in various medicinal applications, including treating disorders amenable to treatment by peptidyl deformyiase inhibitors such as treatment of bacterial infections, and to pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds.<br>
Treatment of microbial infection in host organisms requires an effective means to kill the microbe while doing as little harm to the host as possible. Accordingly, agents which target characteristics unique to a pathology-causing microorganism are desirable for treatment. Penicillin is an extremely well known example of such an agent. Penicillin acts by inhibiting biosynthesis of bacterial cell walls. Since mammalian cells do not require cell walls for survival, administration of penicillin to a human infected with bacteria may kill the bacteria without killing human cells.<br>
However, the use of antibiotics and antimicrobials has also resulted in increased resistance to these agents. As bacteria become resistant to older, more widely used antimicrobial agents, new antimicrobials must be developed in order to provide effective treatments for human and non-human animals suffering from microbial infection.<br>
Peptide deformyiase is a metallopeptidase found in prokaryotic organisms such as bacteria. Protein synthesis in prokaryotic organisms begins with N-formyl methionine (fMet). After initiation of protein synthesis, the formyl group is removed by the enzyme peptide defonmylase (PDF); this activity is essential for maturation of proteins. It has been shown that PDF is required for bacterial growth (Chang et aL, J. Bacteriol., Vol. 171. pp. 4071-4072 (1989); Meinnel et al., J. BacterioL, Vol. 176. No. 23. pp. 7387-7390 (1994); Mazel et aL. EMBO J.. Vol. 13, No. 4, pp. 914-23 (1994)). Since protein synthesis in eukaryotic organisms does not depend on fMet for initiation, agents that will inhibit PDF are attractive candidates for development of new antimicrobial and antibacterial drugs. Prokaryotic organisms, including disease-causing prokaryotes, are described in Balows A, Tnjper HG. Dworkin M. Harder W and Schleifer K-H (eds.). "The Prokaryotes", 2nd ed., New York: Springer-Verlag (1992); and Holt JG (editor-in-chief), "Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology", Vols. 1-4. Baltimore: Williams &amp; Wilkins (1982,1986, 1989).<br>
PDF is part of the metalloproteinase superfamily. While PDF cleariy shares many of the features which characterize metalloproteinases,  it differs from other members of the<br><br>
superfamily in several important respects. First, the metal ion in the active enzyme appears to be Fe (II). or possibly another divalent cationic metal, instead of the zinc ion more commonly encountered (Rajagopalan et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. Vol. 119. pp. 12418-12419 (1997)). Second, the divalent ion appears to play an important role, not only in catalysis, but also in the structural integrity of the protein. Third, the third ligand of the divalent ion is a cysteine, rather than a histidine or a glutamate, as in other metalloproteinases and is not located at the C-terminal side of the HEXXH motif but far away along the amino acid sequence and N-terminal to the motif. Finally, the solution structure shows significant differences in the secondary and tertiary structure of PDF compared to other prototypical metalloproteinases (see Meinnel et al., J. Mol. Biol., Vol. 262, pp. 375-386 (1996)). PDF from E. coll. Bacillus stearothermophilus, and Thenvus thermophilus have been characterized (see Meinnel et al.. J. Mol. Biol., Vol. 267, pp. 749-761 (1997)). The enzyme studied by Meinnel et al. contained a zinc ion as the divalent ion and the structural features summarized above were obtained from zinc-containing proteins. The structure of the protein has also been detemnined by NMR (see O'Connell et al., J. BiomoL NMR, Vol. 13, No. 4, pp. 311-324 (1999)).<br>
Metalloproteinases are critical to many aspects of normal metabolism. The class known as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are involved in tissue remodeling, such as degradation of the extracellular matrix. These enzymes are believed to play a role in normal or beneficial biological events such as the formation of the corpus luteum during pregnancy (see Liu et al.. Endocrinology. Vol. 140, No. 11, pp. 5330-5338 (1999)), wound healing (Yamagiwa et al.. Bone. Vol. 25. No. 2. pp. 197-203 (1999)), and bone growth in healthy children (Bord et al., Bone, Vol. 23, No. 1. pp. 7-12 (1998)). Disorders involving metalloproteinases have been implicated in several diseases such as cancer, arthritis, and autoimmune diseases.<br>
Because of the importance of MMPs in normal physiological processes, it would be preferable to develop agents that inhibit PDF, a metalloproteinase present only in prokaryotes. while avoiding significant inhibition of MMPs. Alternatively, PDF inhibitors which also inhibit MMPs may be of use where the therapeutic benefits of inhibiting PDF outweigh the risk of side effects from MMP inhibition.<br>
A wide variety of compounds have been developed as candidate inhibitors of MMPs and other metalloproteinases, and much effort has also been directed at synthetic methods for these compounds and related compounds (see Izquierdo-Martin et al.. J. Am. Chem. Soc. Vol.  114, pp. 325-331 (1992); Cushman et al.. Chapter 5, "Specific Inhibitors of Zinc<br><br>
Metallopeptidases", Topics in Molecular Pharmacology, Burgen &amp; Roberts, eds. (1981); Mohler et al., Nature. Vol. 370, pp. 218-220 (1994); Gearing et a!..

Research on inhibitors of PDF is much less extensive than that for inhibitors of MMPs. N-fomiyl hydroxylamine derivatives are described in International Patent Application WO 99/39704. Peptide aldehyde inhibitors of PDFs are described in Durand et al., Arch. Biochem. Biophys., Vol. 367, No. 2, pp. 297-302 (1999). The PDF inhibitor (S)-2-0-(H^ phosphonoxy)-L-caproyl-L-leucyl-p-nitroanilide is described in Hao et al.. Biochemistry, Vol. 38, pp. 4712-4719 (1999). and peptidyl H-phosphonate inhibitors of PDF are discussed in Hu et al.. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., Vol. 8, pp. 2479-2482 (1998). Formylated peptides and pseudopeptides are described in Meinnel et al.. Biochemistry, Vol. 38. No. 14. pp. 4288-4295 (1999) as inhibitors of PDF.<br>

A.	Inhibition of Peptide Deformylase Activity<br>
The PDF/FDH coupled assay (Lazennec et al.. Anal. Biochem.. Vol. 224, pp. 180-182 (1997)) is used. In this coupled assay, the fomnate released by PDF from its substrate fMAS is oxidized by the coupling enzyme FDH, reducing one molecule of NAD* to NADH, which causes an increase in absorption at 340 nM. All assays are carried out at rt in a buffer of 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 10 mM NaCI, 0.2 mg/ml BSA. in half-area 96-well microtiter plates (Corning). The reaction is initiated by adding a mixture of 0.5 Unit/ml FDH. 1 mM NAD*, and fMAS at the desired concentration. To determine IC50 (the concentration needed to inhibit 50% of enzyme activity) values, PDF is pre-incubated for 10 minutes with varying concentrations of the inhibitor, and the deformylation reaction is initiated by the addition of reaction mixture containing 4 mM fMAS. The initial reaction velocity, y, is measured as the initial rate of absorption increase at 340 nM using a SpectraMax plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The inhibitor concentration [In] at which 50% of the enzyme activity is inhibited, IC50. is calculated using the following formula:<br>
y = yo/(1+[ln]/IC5o)<br>
where yo is the reaction velocity in the absence of inhibitor. Solving this equation for IC50 at the [In] when y = yJ2 yields IC50. The IC50 is calculated based on a nonlinear least-square regression fit using a commercial software package (Deltapoint, Inc., Chicago, IL.).<br>
Using this assay, the IC50 of various compounds of the invention is detemiined. The IC50 for the various compounds is detemiined against deformylase enzyme containing nickel and zinc as the metal ion. The IC50 values of preferred compounds of fonnula (I) detemnined for the zinc-containing deformylase range from about 0.001 pM to about 0.2 pM. The IC50 values of preferred compounds of fonnula (I) determined for the nickel-containing deformylase ranged from about 0.005 pM to about 3 pM.<br>
B.	Assay for Testing Antimicrobial Activitv<br>
Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) are detemiined using the microdilution method In 96-well format plates. Compounds are suspended in DMSO at 5 or 10 mg/ml and stored at 4'C until used. They are diluted in Mueller-Hinton Broth (MHB) or Trypticase Soy Broth (TSB) and used for MIC detemiination. The range of concentrations tested is 64-0.0625 //g/ml final concentration using a two-fold dilution system.<br><br>
The inoculum is prepared from cells grown on Trypticase Soy Agar (TSA) and incubated overnight at 35*'C, 5-10 colonies are used to inoculate MHB or TSB broths, and the culture is incubated overnight at 35**C. The overnight culture is diluted 1:10, incubated for 1 hour at 35X. diluted to the appropriate inoculum size and applied to the v\/ells containing broth and test compound. Inoculum sizes are 2x10'* CFU/ml.<br>
Plates are incubated at SS^'C for 48 hours and MIC are recorded after 18 hours of incubation for bacteria. MIC is defined as the lowest concentration of a compound of the invention that does not produce visible growth after incubation.<br>
Minimum inhibitory concentration for various preferred compounds of formula (I) ranges from about 0.25 pg/mj to about 32 pg/ml against H. influenza (four strains), from about 0.001 pg/ml to greater than 8 pg/ml against S. aureus (four strains), from about 0.016 pg/ml to about 16 pg/ml against S. pneumonia (four strains), and from about 0.008 pg/ml to about 16 pg/ml against M. catanhalls. The deformylase enzyme is obtained from E. coli<br>
C. Demonstration of Selective Inhibition of PDF Compared to MMP-7 (Matrilysin)<br>
As noted previously, inhibitors which are selective for peptidyl deformylase over MMPs are desirable in order to avoid side effects.<br>
In order to test the compounds of the invention for possible inhibitory effects on MMPs. the following assay for MMP-7 (matrilysin) is used.<br>
MMP'7 (Matrilysin) Assay,<br>
Matrilysin activity is assayed using a thio-peptide (Pro-Leu-Gly-S-Leu-Leu-Gly) as substrate. Upon enzyme hydrolysis, the thiolate is released as a product. The thiolate thus generated reacts with DTNB (dithionitrobenzene). giving rise to a yellow color which is monitored at 405 nM. The assay is carried out at rt; the assay buffer contains 50 mM Tricine, pH 7.5, 0.2 M NaCI, 10 mM CaCb. and 0.05% Brij. in a half-area 96-well microtiter plate. The reaction is initiated by adding a mixture of 200 TM DTNB and 100 TM thiopeptide in buffer. To determine IC50 (the concentration needed to inhibit 50% of enzyme activity) values, MMP-7 is preincubated for 10 minutes with varying concentrations of compounds of the invention, and the hydrolysis initiated by the addition of reaction mixture containing thiopeptide and DTNB. The reaction rate is recorded as the absorbance increase in OD405 over 30 minutes<br><br>
using a SpectraMax plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The inhibitor concentration [In] at which 50% of the enzyme activity is inhibited, IC50. is calculated using the following formula:<br><br>
where yo is the reaction velocity in the absence of inhibitor. Solving this equation for IC50 at the [In] when y = yo/2 yields IC50.<br>
Using this assay, the IC50 of various compounds of the invention are determined. The IC50 of various prefered compounds of formula (I) against MMP-7 ranges from greater than 10 \JM to greater than 100 pM. whereas the IC50 of these same compounds against zinc-containing PDF ranges from about 0.005 pM to about 5 pM, and against nickel-containing PDF ranged from about 0.001 pM to about 0.3 pM. Accordingly, compounds of the invention have superior selectivity for PDF as compared to their activity against MMP-7. Similar selectivity of the compounds for peptidyl defonmylase over MMP-1. MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, MMP-13. MT-MMP-1, and tissue necrosis factor converting enzyme is observed. Similar selectivity is also observed over other metalioproteinases such as angiotensin converting enzyme.<br>
D. Mouse Septicemia Model for Determining In Vivo Efficacy<br>
CD1 female out-bred mice (Charles River Laboratories) weighing 18-22 g each are injected intraperitoneally with 0.5 ml of a suspension containing 5 x 10^ cfu of S. aureus (Smith strain) in 7% hog gastric mucosa (mucin). The mice are treated, either subcutaneously (s.c). intravenously (i.v.) or orally (p.o.), 1 hour and 5 hours after infection. Six groups of six mice each are given different dosage levels representing two-fold dilutions of each compound to be tested (range of 100-0.1 mg/kg). Vancomycin is used as the control antibiotic and is administered s.c. Compounds of the invention are fomnulated in PBS and untreated controls are dosed with vehicle alone.<br>
Deaths in each group are monitored daily for 6 days and cumulative mortality is used to determine the 50% protective doses (PD50). which are calculated using the method of Reed and Muench. The PD50 (s.c.) in mice against S. aureus for several preferred compound of formula (I) ranges from about 0.1 mg/kg to greater than 12 mg/kg. The PD50 (p.o.) in mice against S. aureus for these same compounds of fonnula (I) ranges from 1 mg/ml to greater than 12 mg/kg.<br><br>
E, Pharmacokinetics Study of PDF Inhibitors in Mice<br>
The pharmacokinetics of PDF compounds are determined in CD1 female out-bred mice (Charles River Laboratories) weighing 20-25 g. PDF compounds are formulated in 20% cyclodextrin (Aldrich) and filtered through 0.22 pm filter for sterilization. Either single compound or mixtures of 4-6 compounds as a cassette are administered i.v. and p.o. at 10 ml/kg. The dose ranged from 3-15 mg/kg for each compound. At 0.083, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 7 hours after dosing, serum samples are collected via cardiac puncture under anesthesia. Groups of four mice are used for each time point. The serum samples are stored at -SO^'C until analysis.<br>
The serum protein is precipitated by addition of acetonitrile. The samples after protein precipitation are analyzed by LC/MS/MS method. Standard curve is obtained for each compound and used for determination of compound concentration in serum. The pharmacokinetics parameters including T^ax (time of maximum concentration), Cmax (maximum concentration), ti/2 (terminal half-life), and AUG (area under the curve), are calculated according to standard method. The oral bioavailability is calculated as the ratio of AUG of p.o. administration vs. the AUG administered i.v. The preferred compounds of formula (I) exhibit oral bioavailability greater than 70%.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are, therefore, useful for the treatment and/or prevention of infectious disorders caused by a variety of bacterial or prokaryotic organisms. Examples include, but are not limited to, Gram positive and Gram negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, including Staphylococci, e.g. S. aureus and S. epidermidis] Enterococci, e.g. E. faecalis and E faecium; Streptococci, e.g. S. pneumoniae; Haemopliilus, e.g. H. influenza; Moraxella, e.g. M. catarrhalis; Bacteroides, e.g., Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium, e.g., Clostridium difficile, Niesseria, e.g., N. meningitidis and N. gonorrfioae, Legionella, and Escherichia, e.g. E colL Other examples include Mycobacteria, e.g. M. tuberculosis] intercellular microbes, e.g. Chlamydia and Rickettsiae; and Mycoplasma, e.g. M. pneumoniae; and Pseudomonas, e.g. P. aeruginosa; Helicobacter pylori; and parasites, e.g. Plasmodium falciparum.<br>
As used herein, an "infectious disorder*' is any disorder characterized by the presence of a microbial infection, such as the presence of bacteria. Such infectious disorders include, for example, central nervous system infections, external ear infections, infections of the middle ear, such as acute otitis media, infections of the cranial sinuses, eye infections, infections of the oral cavity, such as infections of the teeth, gums and mucosa, upper respiratory tract<br><br>
infections, lower respiratory tract infections, genitourinary infections, gastrointestinal infections, gynecological infections, septicemia, bone and joint infections, skin and skin stojcture infections, bacterial endocarditis, bums, antibacterial prophylaxis of surgery, antibacterial prophylaxis in immunosuppressed patients, such as patients receiving cancer chemotherapy, or organ transplant patients and chronic diseases caused by infectious organisms, e.g. arteriosclerosis.<br>
The compounds may be used to treat a subject to treat, prevent, and/or reduce the severity of an infection. Subjects include animals, plants, blood products, cultures and surfaces such as those of medical or research equipment, such as glass, needles, surgical equipment and tubing, and objects intended for temporary or permanent implantation into an organism. Preferred animals include mammals, e.g. mice, rats, cats. dogs, cows, sheep, pigs, horses, swine, primates, such as rhesus monkeys, chimpanzees, gorillas, and most preferably humans. Treating a subject includes, but is not limited to, preventing, reducing, and/or eliminating the clinical symptoms caused by an infection of a subject by a microorganism; preventing, reducing, and/or eliminating an infection of a subject by a microorganism; or preventing, reducing, and/or eliminating contamination of a subject by a microorganism. The microorganism involved is preferably a prokaryote, more preferably a bacterium.<br>
For the above uses the required dosage will of course vary depending on the mode of administration, the particular condition to be treated and the effect desired. The compositions may contain, for example, from about 0.1% by weight to about 99% by weight, e.g. from about 10-60% by weight, of the active material, depending on the method of administration. Where the compositions comprise dosage units, each unit will contain, for example, from about 1-1000 mg. e.g. 1-500 mg, of the active ingredient. The dosage as employed for adult human treatment will range, for example, from about 1-3000 mg per day. for instance 1500 mg per day depending on the route and frequency of administration. Such a dosage con^esponds to about 0.015-50 mg/kg per day. Suitably the dosage is, for example, from about 5-20 mg/kg per day. Suitable unit dosage forms for oral administration comprise ca. 0.25-1500 mg active ingredient.<br>
A "phannaceuticaijy acceptable carrier" means an excipient that is useful in preparing a pharmaceutical composition that is generally safe, non-toxic and neither biologically nor otherwise undesirable, and includes an excipient that is acceptable for veterinary use as well<br><br>
as human pharmaceutical use. A "phamnaceutically acceptable carrier" as used in the specification and claims includes both one and more than one such can-iers.<br>
The compounds may be administered by any conventional route, e.g. locally or systemically e.g. orally, topically, parenterally, subdermally, or by inhalation and may be used for the treatment of bacterial infection in a subject such as animals, preferably, mammals, more preferably, humans.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be formulated for administration in any convenient way for use in human or veterinary medicine, by analogy with other antibiotics. Such methods are known in the art (see, e.g. Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Easton. PA; Mack Publishing Co.) and are not described in detail herein.<br>
The compositions may be in any form known in the art, including but not limited to tablets, capsules, wafers, fast melts (without wafers), powders, granules, lozenges, creams or liquid preparations, such as oral or sterile parenteral solutions or suspensions. The compounds may also be administered in liposomal, micellar or microemulsion formulations. The compounds may also be administered as prodrugs, where the prodrug administered undergoes biotransformation in the treated mammal to a form which is biologically active.<br>
The topical formulations of the present invention may be presented as, for instance, ointments, creams or lotions, solutions, salves, emulsions, plasters, eye ointments and eye or ear drops, impregnated dressings, transdermal patches, sprays and aerosols, and may contain appropriate conventional additives such as preservatives, solvents to assist drug penetration and emollients in ointments and creams.<br>
The formulations may also contain compatible conventional carriers, such as cream or ointment bases and ethanol or oleyl alcohol for lotions. Such carriers may be present, for example, from about 1% up to about 99% of the formulation. For example, they may fomri up to about 80% of the formulation.<br>
Tablets and capsules for oral administration may be in unit dose presentation fonn, and may contain conventional excipients such as binding agents, for example, syrup, acacia, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth, or polyvinylpyrollidone; fillers, for example, lactose, sugar, maize-starch, calcium phosphate, sorbitol or glycine; tabletting lubricants, for example, magnesium stearate. talc, polyethylene glycol or silica; disintegrants, for example, potato starch; or<br><br>
acceptable wetting agents, such as sodium lauryl sulphate. The tablets may be coated according to methods well-known in standard pharmaceutical practice.<br>
Oral liquid preparations may be in the fomri of, for example, aqueous or oily suspensions, solutions, emulsions, syrups or elixirs, or may be presented as a dry product for reconstitution with water or another suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may contain conventional additives, such as suspending agents, for example, sorbitol, methyl cellulose, glucose syrup, gelatin, hydroxyethyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, aluminium stearate gel or hydrogenated edible fats; emulsifying agents, for example, lecithin, sorbitan monooleate, or acacia; non-aqueous vehicles (which may include edible oils), for example, almond oil, oily esters such as glycerine, propylene glycol, or ethyl alcohol; preservatives, for example, methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoate or sorbic acid, and, if desired, conventional flavoring or coloring agents.<br>
For parenteral administration, fluid unit dosage fonns are prepared utilizing the compound and a sterile vehicle, water being prefen'ed. The compound, depending on the vehicle and concentration used, may be either suspended or dissolved in the vehicle or other suitable solvent. In preparing solutions, the compound may be dissolved in water for injection and filter sterilized before filling into a suitable vial or ampule and sealing. Advantageously, agents such as a local anesthetic preservative and buffering agents may be dissolved in the vehicle. To enhance the stability, the composition may be frozen after filling into the vial and the water removed under vacuum. The dry lyophilized powder is then sealed in the vial and an accompanying vial of water for injection may be supplied to reconstitute the liquid prior to use. Parenteral suspensions are prepared in substantially the same manner except that the compound is suspended in the vehicle instead of being dissolved and sterilization cannot be accomplished by filtration. The compound may be sterilized by exposure to ethylene oxide before suspending in the sterile vehicle. Advantageously, a surfactant or wetting agent is included in the composition to facilitate uniform distribution of the compound.<br>
