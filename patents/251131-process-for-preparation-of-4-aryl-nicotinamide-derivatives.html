Scheme 1<br><br>
This method for manufacturing the compounds of general formula I is high-yielding but requires the use of expensive starting materials. Furthermore, the key step in this method is the substitution of the pyridine with R R C6H3MgCl by Grignard Reaction. The success of this reaction depends on the substitution patter on the aromatic. ring. In case that electron withdrawing groups decrease the reactivity of the Grignard reagent, a Suzuki type reaction (Suzuki Coupling) must be performed.<br>

This process is useful for the synthesis of further NKl receptor antagonists.<br><br><br><br><br>
