BACKGROUND Field<br>
[0002]	The  invention   relates   generally  to   wireless   communication,   and  more<br>
specifically to data rate control in a wireless communication system.<br>
Background<br>
[0003]	Wireless communication systems are used in many applications including, for<br>
example, paging, wireless local loops (WLL), Internet telephony, wireless telephone and satellite communication systems. An exemplary application of a wireless telephone system is a cellular telephone system for remote subscribers which are often mobile. In a typical cellular telephone system mobile subscribers, or mobile stations, transmit and receive signals from various base stations within a wireless network infrastructure of the communication system as the mobile station moves about.<br>
[0004]	Modern wireless communication systems, such as cellular telephone system, are<br>
typically designed to allow multiple users, or subscribers, to access a common communications medium. Various techniques have been developed for these multiple access wireless communication systems including code division multiple access (CDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA), and frequency division multiple access (FDMA). These multiple access techniques encode, modulate, decode, and demodulate signals transmitted and received between the multiple users and the wireless network infrastructure, thereby enabling simultaneous communication among multiple users and allowing for a relatively large capacity for the communication systems.<br><br>
WO 2005/039232<br><br>
3<br><br>
PCT/US2004/033787<br><br>
J0005]	In a wireless communication system based on CDMA, the available radio<br>
frequency (RF) spectrum is shared efficiently among a number of users. Wireless communication systems typically transmit voice messages and more recently, systems with enhanced capacity for data services are also available. An example of such a data-services communication system is the high data rate (HDR) system that conforms to the Telecommunications Industry Association/ Electronic Industries Alliance (TIA/EIA) cdma2000 High Data Rate Air Interface Specification IS-856, January 2002 (the IS-856 standard).<br>
[0006]	In a wireless communication system, such as one based on CDMA or one of the<br>
other multiple access techniques mentioned, users are often mobile. As a user moves about they may move out of the coverage area of a sector of a base station or out of the coverage area of the base station itself. As a user, also referred to as a mobile or a mobile station, moves in and out of different coverage areas such that the user leaves one coverage area and enters another, to maintain communications a technique known as a "handoff” occurs. In a handoff the mobile station begins communicating with a sector of a base station, simply referred to as a base station, in the coverage area it is entering and terminates communication with the base station in the coverage area it is leaving. Using a technique referred to as "soft handoff" the mobile station will, simultaneously be in communication with the two base stations during the handoff. In other words, the mobile will remain in communication with the base station whose coverage area the mobile is leaving while also establishing communication with the base station whose coverage area the mobile is entering. In such a technique, both the base stations either jointly or independently decode the mobile stations transmission. Communicating with both base stations during the soft handoff reduces the chance of a dropped call or other unintentional loss of communication.<br>
[0007]	The data rate that can be supported by each of the two base stations involved in a<br>
handoff may be different, for example, due to the level of congestion of the respective base station. The level of congestion in a system may be determined by monitoring the data rates of users, and the received signal strength required to achieve a desired quality of service (QoS). The communication link from the mobile to the base station is called the reverse link or uplink. In a wireless CDMA system, the reverse link capacity is interference-limited and one measure of the cell congestion is the total received power over the level of the thermal noise at a base station. The total received power over the<br><br>
WO 2005/039232	4	PCT/US2004/033787<br>
thermal noise is commonly referred to as the "rise over thermal" (ROT) and corresponds to loading of the reverse link. Typically, it is desirable to maintain the ROT near a predetermined value. If the ROT is too high, the coverage of the cell, that is the distance over which the base station of the cell can communicate, is reduced and the reverse link is less stable. A reduced cell coverage (such as from excessive ROT) can adversely affect the data rate that can be supported in the cell and the mobile stations at the edge of the cell may drop their calls. The coverage of the cell reduces with high ROT due to an increase in the amount of transmit energy required at the mobile station to provide a target energy level at the base station. Typically mobiles are somewhat limited in the transmit power they have and thus a requirement to increase transmit power corresponds to a decreased range. A low ROT can indicate that the reverse link is not heavily loaded, thus indicating that available data rate capacity is potentially being wasted.<br>
[0008]	If a base station and a mobile involved in a handoff can support different data<br>
rates, then the data rate of the mobile station during a handoff may not be optimal. For example, if the base station to which the mobile is handing off can support a higher data rate than is being used by the mobile, then the mobile may be operating at a lower data rate than is possible, in which case there may be a waste of system resources. If the base station to which the mobile is handing off cannot support a data rate as high as the mobile is operating with, then the mobile can be causing increased interference with other users and could be degrading system performance. A form of rate management in a soft-handoff region can be achieved with co-ordination between base-stations. However, the co-ordination between base-stations over the infrastructure, or backhaul, may be slow or there may not be any support to carry out the co-ordination between two base stations.<br>
[0009]	There is therefore a need in the art for improving distributed data rate control<br>
during handoff in a wireless communication system.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0010]	Embodiments disclosed herein address the above stated needs by providing<br>
methods and apparatus for controlling a data rate of a transmission in a wireless communication system during handoff. A mobile station transmission is received and decoded by multiple base stations in the mobile station's handoff list. Any base station<br><br>
5	PCT/US2004/033787<br>
WO 2005/039232<br>
in the handoff list that successfully decodes a transmission sends an acknowledgement on the downlink to the mobile station. The mobile station then determines a rate control command based on transmissions from the base stations that include an acknowledgement message. The mobile adjusts its data rate of transmission in accordance with the rate control command.<br>
[0011]	In another aspect, a base station other than the base station that has sent the<br>
acknowledgement message may desire to communicate a desired data rate command to the mobile station. The base station desiring to send a rate command may be the primary base station that has the Quality of Service (QoS) and other scheduling information, or the base station may be a non-primary base station that is heavily congested and may desire to lower the rate of the transmission. The desired rate command may then be used by the mobile in determining the data rate of transmission based on rate commands from the primary base station and the non-primary base stations.<br>
[0012]	Controlling a data rate of transmission in a wireless communication system<br>
during handoff can include receiving transmissions from a plurality of base stations, then determining a plurality of rate control commands from the respective received transmissions from the plurality of base stations. The rate control commands may then be combined, and the data rate of transmission adjusted in accordance with the combined rate control commands. In the case of automatic repeat request (ARQ), non co-located base stations in handoff, may decode the transmissions independently and send acknowledgement (ACK) asynchronously. The asynchronous ACKs leads to synchronization problems in transmitting a rate control command. The base stations that do not ACK the transmission may not send a rate control command that may be interpreted as a HOLD state of the rate control command. Aspects relating to this scenario are described that provide effective ways of combining rate control commands in handoff while being ACKed by non co-coordinating multiple base stations.<br>
[0013]	Combining the rate control commands can include applying weighting factors to<br>
the received rate control commands. For example, the rate control command of a primary base station can be assigned a larger weighting factor than commands from non-primary base stations. Combining the rate commands can also include establishing a rate control command based on a desired quality of service for the primary base<br><br>
WO 2005/039232<br><br><br><br>
PCT/US2004/O33787<br><br>
station so that the primary base station controls the data rate ramp-up and non-primary base stations provide data rate control based on system congestion.<br>
{0014]	A further aspect of combining the rate control commands from multiple base<br>
stations includes decreasing the data rate if at least one of the data rate commands is for a decreased rate. Another aspect of combining the rate control commands includes maintaining the data rate if none of the data rate commands is for a decreased rate and at least one of the data rate commands is a command to hold the data rate, for example if the data rate command is a null command. Yet another aspect of combining the rate control commands includes maintaining the data rate if none of the data rate commands is for a decreased rate, an increase rate or a command to hold the data rate, but instead is a different command, such as a null command. A further aspect of combining the rate control commands includes increasing the data rate if none of the data rate commands is for a decreased rate or a command to hold the data rate and at least one data rate command is for an increased data rate.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
(0021]	The word "exemplary" is used herein to mean "serving as an example, instance,<br>
or illustration." Any embodiment described herein as "exemplary" is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments.<br>
[0022)	Figure 1 shows portions of a communication system 100 constructed in<br>
accordance with the present invention. The communication system 100 includes<br>
infrastructure 101, multiple wireless communication devices (WCD) or mobile stations<br>
(MS) 104 and 105, and landline communication devices 122 and 124. In general,<br>
WCDs may be either mobile or fixed, and "WCD" will be used interchangeably with<br>
"MS" and "mobile."<br>
(0023)	The infrastructure 101 includes components such as base stations 102, base<br>
station controllers 106, mobile switching centers 10S, a switching network 120, and the<br>
like. In one embodiment, the base station 102 is integrated with the base station<br>
controller 106, and in other embodiments the base station 102 and the base station<br>
controller 106 are separate components. Different types of switching networks. 120 may<br>
be used to route signals in the communication system 100, for example, the switching<br>
network 120 may be the public switched telephone network (PSTN).<br>
(0024]	The term "forward link" refers to the signal path from the infrastructure 101 to a<br>
WCD 104,105 and the term "reverse link" refers to the signal path from a WCD to the infrastructure. As shown in Figure 1, WCDs 104 and 105 receive signals 132 and 136 on the forward link and transmit signals 134 and 138 on the reverse link. In general, signals transmitted from a WCD 104 and 105 are intended for reception at another communication device, such as another remote unit, or at a landline communication device 122 and 124, respectively, and are routed through the switching network 120. For example, if the signal 134 transmitted from an initiating WCD 104 is intended to be received by a destination WCD 105, the signal is routed through the infrastructure and a signal 136 is transmitted on the forward link to the destination WCD 105. Typically, a communication device, such as a WCD or a landline communication device, may be both an initiator of and a destination for the signals.<br>
(0025]	Examples of WCDs 104 include cellular telephones, wireless communication<br>
enabled personal computers, and personal digital assistants (PDA), and other wireless devices. The communication system 100 may be designed to support one or more wireless standards.   For example, the standards may include standards referred to as<br><br>
WO 2005/039232	PCT/US2004/033787<br>
TIA/EIA-95-B (IS-95), TLA/EIA-98-C (IS-98), cdma2000, Wideband CDMA (WCDMA), and others.<br>
[0026]	Figure 2 is a block diagram illustrating a WCD 202 during a handoff between<br>
two base stations 204 and 206. As shown in Figure 2, a WCD device 202 is communicating with two base stations 204 and 206. In this illustration, the primary base station 204 (BS1) is the base station whose coverage area the WCD 202 is currently in, and the non-primary base station 206 (BS2) is the base station whose coverage area the WCD 202 is entering.<br>
10027J	The Third Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2), a collaborative third<br>
generation (3G) telecommunications specifications-setting project comprising North American and Asian interests for developing global specifications for ANSI/TIA/EIA-41 Cellular Radio telecommunication Intersystem Operations network evolution of 3G, has received proposals for techniques for controlling data rate from one or many base stations during a hand off In accordance with these proposals, a base station controlling the WCD sends a dedicated rate control command (a tri-state bit) which can either be UP, HOLD, or DOWN, signifying an increase, hold or decrease in rate or traffic-to-pilot ratio of the next transmission. If the WCD is in soft-handoff, the rate control commands can be received from different base stations. The rate control commands from different base stations can be combined to obtain an effective rate control command. A drawback with this approach occurs when base station and WCD uses a technique referred to as hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) to improve the performance of the system. With HARQ enabled, a mobile station sends same or different encoded copy of same packet till the base station ACKs the transmission of the packet. A mobile station transmits a new packet at a new rate only when it has successfully transmitted the previous packet or has transmitted the previous packet for maximum number of times allowed. A mobile station has successfully transmitted a packet if it receives acknowledgement (ACK) from at least a single base station in its soft-handoff list. Due to this, a base station in soft-handoff sends an UP or a DOWN rate control command only when it has successfully decoded a packet and sends an ACK message on Forward Acknowledgement Channel (F-ACKCH) of the base station. A HOLD corresponds to no transmission on the rate control channel, and is power efficient when the base station is not expecting a new transmission from the mobile station. Because the quality of transmissions received by different base stations may be different, all base stations in a<br><br>
WO 2005/039232	PCT/US2»MM/033787<br>
mobile stations soft-handoff list do not ACK the mobile at the same time. The dedicated rate control approach that works without HARQ may be redefined in a system which uses both soft-handoff across different base stations and HARQ for performance improvement. In an exemplary embodiment, a WCD monitors the Forward Rate Control Channels (F-RCCH) of a base station when it receives an acknowledgement message (ACK) on the Forward Acknowledgement Channel (F-ACKCH) from the base station. A problem with this approach can occur if the WCD 202 is in a soft handoff with the primary base station 204 and the non-primary base station 206, and the WCD 202 receives an ACK only from the non-primary base station 206. Even though 204 is a primary base station and may be receiving more interference power from the WCD 202, the lightly loaded base station 206 may decode the mobile station transmissions and send a rate control command along with ACK requesting the WCD 202 to go UP in rate. If this occurs, the primary base station 204 may not able to control the rate of the WCD 202 via rate control commands.<br>
[0028]	An exception to this rule occurs after the last transmission corresponding to a<br>
data packet is sent, at which time the WCD monitors all the F-RCCHs that are assigned to the WCD, regardless of whether or not the WCD receives ACK from a BS. However, this scheme is very sensitive to control signaling errors, including reverse packet data control channel (R-PDCCH) errors and forward-acknowledgement channel (F-ACKCH) errors. For example, R-PDCCH contains the control information indicating the transmitted rate on the data/packet channel and the transmission number (also called subpacket number) of the packet. The Subpacket number indicates how many times the packet has been transmitted and unsuccessful decoded at the base station. If the subpacket number is equal to the maximum number of transmissions allowed, then the current transmission on the packet channel is the last transmission to deliver the packet correctly to the BS. If a BS is unable to decode the R-PDCCH transmission from a WCD, the BS will be unaware that a subpacket is the last subpacket and that it should send a rate control indicator to the MS. The MS would interpret the no transmission on F-RCCH to be a HOLD command. The HOLD command prevents the WCD's rate from going up, even though the BS had no intention to send a HOLD command and may be able to support higher date rate traffic.<br>
[0029]	In another embodiment, a mobile station monitors rate control command only<br>
from the primary base station.  In this approach, non-primary base stations that may<br><br>
WO 2W05/0392J2	PCT/US2004/033787<br>
receive the interference from the mobile station are not able to control the mobile station. Further, the mobile station is moving, the mobile station may enter the service area of another base station and may perform cell switching. During cell switching, the MS communicates with the primary BS1 204 by sending a predetermined number of switching frames indicating the non-primary BS2 206 will become the primary base station. The switching between base stations is over when the MS receives a Switch End Indicator from the old primary BS1 204 or when a predetermined number of switching frames have been sent. The rate control operation from the primary base station is not explicitly specified during the switching interval. Following is a description of some of the different techniques that can be used during soft handoff and cell switching where various problems are identified along with ways of addressing the problems. <br>
Case 1<br>
[0030]	In this embodiment, an acknowledgement message (ACK) transmitted by a base<br>
station (BS) is received by the mobile station (MS) if the decoded transmission corresponded to a packet that has not been sent the maximum number of times allowed. When the MS receives the ACK, it adjusts its data rate in accordance with the rate control bit(s) transmitted from the BS mat ACK the transmission. The rate control bits received by the mobile station from base stations that did not send the ACK are ignored. The mobile station monitors the rate control bit from all the base stations only when the previous transmission corresponded to a packet that was transmitted a maximum number of times allowed.<br>
[0031]	There are several advantages to this approach.    One is that if the previous<br>
transmission is not the last transmission of a packet, the base station can make a rate decision for the next transmission only if it ACKs the previous transmission and expects new transmission. Also, when a base station doesn't ACK to the previous transmission from a mobile station, it doesn't send anything on the rate control command, thereby being power efficient while being sure that the rate control bit is ignored and not interpreted as HOLD by the mobile station. Another advantage is that this technique treats primary and non-primary base stations similarly. Therefore even when the primary base station changes during cell switching, the rate control operation from the base stations in soft-handoff is not influenced.<br><br>
WO 2005/039232	PCT/US2004/033787<br>
[0032]	A problem with this technique can occur if there are load imbalances between<br>
the base stations involved in the handoff. For example, a problem can occur if the MS 202 is performing a soft handoff from a primary BS 204 to a non primary BS 206 and the primary BS 204 is fully loaded on the reverse link, say with a rise-over-thermal (ROT) of 7 dB, while the non-primary BS 206 has a relatively unloaded reverse-link, say with an ROT of 2 dB. In this example of load imbalance, the MS 202 may have a better reverse-link with the non primary BS 204, since the transmission from the MS 202 sees less interference. On the other hand, the reverse-link with the primary BS 204 may be weak, even though the primary BS 204 may have a better forward-link to the MS 202. In this scenario, the non-primary BS 206 can decode the MS 202 data packet and send an ACK message to the MS 202. Since the non-primary BS 206 is lightly loaded, it will send rate control bit(s) to increase the rate of the MS The primary BS 204, on the other hand, may be fully loaded, or congested, and if it receives the MS 202 transmission at a lower SNR it may not be able to decode the transmission and send an ACK. If the primary BS 204 doesn't decode the transmission from MS 202, it doesn't send a rate control command to the MS 202, thereby losing control on the MS 202 transmission even though it receives more interference from the MS 202. If the MS 202 adjusts its data rate in accordance with the rate control bit(s) sent by the lightly loaded BS 206 and increases its data rate, this can result in the congested primary BS 204 receiving more and more interference from the MS 202, which it will be unable to adequately control. One solution to this problem is to have the primary BS 204 decode the reverse packet data control channel (R-PDCCH) transmitted by the MS 202 and check the data rate. If the MS 202 data rate is higher than desired by the primary BS 204, the primary BS 204 can control the MS 202 transmission rate by requesting the non-primary BS 206 send RC bit(s) to the MS to decrease the MS data rate. The primary BS can send the request to the non primary BS directly, or through the communication system infrastructure or backhaul, or in other ways appropriate to the system configuration.<br>
[0033]	Another problem with this technique (transmitting ACK from BS to MS) is that<br>
both the primary BS 204 and the non-primary BS 206 should be aware of the QoS requirements of the mobile station. In most scenarios, a non-primary BS 206 that decodes the MS transmissions only rarely doesn't have accurate QoS information and current requirements of the MS 202.   In the absence of QoS requirements of the MS<br><br>
WO 2005/039232<br><br><br><br>
PCT7US2WM/033787<br><br>
202, the non-primary BS 206 will not be able to send an appropriate rate control command to the MS unless the primary and non-primary BS co-ordinate via the backhaul to exchange this information. <br>
Case II<br>
[0034]	In a second embodiment, the MS 202 adjusts its data rate in accordance with RC<br>
bit(s) only from a primary BS 204. In other words, the MS 202 adjusts its data rate in accordance with rate control bit(s) transmitted by the BS 204 currently designated as the primary BS even if an ACK is received from a non-primary BS 206. This technique has an advantage in that if the primary BS does not want to change the data rate it will not transmit a rate control bit(s), which is recognized as a HOLD command by the MS and saves power on the BS forward link (FL). Thus, even if a non-primary BS 206 sends an ACK to the MS, the non-primary BS 206 doesn't send rate control bit(s) to the MS. If the primary BS 204 is congested, it can send DOWN rate control bit(s) and the MS will adjust its data rate accordingly even if a non-primary BS sends an ACK. In accordance with this embodiment, only a primary BS 204 needs to maintain the QoS information and update the current requirements of the mobile station.<br>
[0035)	A problem with this technique is that the non-primary BS 206 has no control on<br>
the power it receives from the MS transmission mat acts as interference in reception of the other MS transmissions. In the case of imbalance in propagation loss between forward link and reverse link, the non-primary BS receives uncontrolled power from the MS. Under the embodiment, this problem can be addressed only when the non-primary BS 206 requests the primary BS 204 to send a DOWN rate control command. The non-primary BS can send the request to the primary BS directly, or through the communication system infrastructure or backhaul, or in other ways appropriate to the system configuration.<br>
[0036]	In this rate control approach, the rate control algorithm is not completely defined<br>
in the mobile environment, when the MS 202 performs cell switching. Before cell switching, the BS 204 is the primary BS while BS(s) 206 are the non-primary BS. Due to the mobile motion, the received signal from a non-primary BS 206 may become stronger than the signal from the primary BS 204. Therefore, during cell switching, the MS 202 transmits switching frames indicating 206 as its new primary BS. Before the switching frames are decoded by a base station, the BS 204 regards itself as the primary BS for the MS 202. The problem occurs as the MS 202 doesn't know when to regard<br><br>
WO 2005/039232	PCT/US2004/033787<br>
BS 206 as its new primary BS and start listening to the RC bit from the BS 206. This problem can be addressed by having the MS 202 listen to rate control commands from both the primary and non-primary BSs during cell switching and apply an OR-of-HOLD rule, where the MS will hold its data rate if either BS sends a HOLD command, followed by applying the OR-of-DOWN rule, where the MS will decrease its data rate if either BS commands a lower data rate. This approach gives the two BS more control over the MS 202 transmission. In yet another embodiment that addresses this problem, the MS 202 listens to the rate control command only from the previous primary BS 204 during the switching period. Only when last switching indicator is sent or the MS 202 receives an acknowledgement of the switch, it starts listening to the rate control command from the BS 206, the new primary BS. The BS 206 starts sending a rate control command as soon as it decodes the switching indicator. During the period, the switch indicator is decoded by a BS to the time the MS receives an acknowledgement, the MS 202 listens to rate control bit(s) from the BS 204 whale the BS 206 sends the rate control bit(s). Because a lack of transmission of rate control in the forward rate control channel (F-RCCH) from the BS 204 will be interpreted as HOLD by me MS 202, neither of the base stations will be able to change the rate of the MS 202 during mis interim period. <br>
CaseIII<br>
10037]	In this technique all cell sectors in the MS Active Set contribute to the control of<br>
the MS data rate. This control is referred to as being symmetric, with the MS active Set members controlling the MS ramp-up with an OR-of-DOWN rule followed by OR-of-HOLD rule. This technique has an advantage that in all BSs communicating with the MS will contribute to the control the data rate of the MS transmission and so the ROT of a base station is less dramatically affected by any single MS and is more controlled. The technique operates similarly in both soft handoff and cell switching.<br>
{0038J	However, mere are multiple problems with this technique, particularly in<br>
scenarios where the multiple base stations in soft-handoff are not co-located and the decoding decisions of each are not known to other base stations by the time each BS makes its rate control decision. For example, in a system with hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ), a new packet is not transmitted by a MS until it receives ACK from one of the base stations in soft-handoff or until the MS has transmitted a packet for maximum allowed number of times. Therefore, when the previous transmission is not<br><br>
WO 2»&gt;©5/03«&gt;232	PCT/US2M-I/033787<br>
the last transmission of a packet, the base station doesn't know whether it can schedule the MS for a new transmission unless it decodes the previous transmission and ACKs the mobile station. In absence of this knowledge, the BS that doesn't ACK the mobile stations previous transmission may send a HOLD command to save power on the forward link. However, by OR-of-HOLD rule, the MS will not be able to increase its transmission rate unless all the base stations ACK the mobile station at the same time. To circumvent this problem, the base station that doesn't ACK the MS has to send an UP rate control command all the time. This includes the times when MS is not transmitting anything on its reverse packet channel since the base station may not be able to distinguish no transmission from transmission not decoded. This is highly power inefficient, since each BS wastes the forward-link power in sending an UP rate control command all those times, the base station doesn't send an ACK to the mobile station<br>
 Case IV<br>
(D039]	m this embodiment, all cell sectors in the MS Active Set control the MS ramp-<br>
up with an OR-of-DOWN rule followed by OR-of-HOLD role, similar to Case m. However, unlike Case HL, the control is asymmetric with the primary BS providing the fundamental regulation of the MS data rate ramp-up while the non-primary BSs provide congestion control. In other words, the primary sector sends a tri-state rate control (-1, 0, +1) command based on a desired QoS to the MS where no transmission (0) on rate control bit in rate control channel corresponds to the HOLD. Non-primary BSs sends an ON-OFF (-1, 0) rate control bit where no transmission (0) corresponds to UP or Don't Care while an ON state corresponds to DOWN. The non-primary BS may send rate control command based on the congestion level of the respective non-primary BS. The non-primary BSs send an UP rate command to the MS if the non-primary BS is not congested and a DOWN rate command if the non-primary BS is congested. For example, fee non-primary BS may send an UP rate command if its ROT indicates a low congestion level and a DOWN rate command if its ROT indicates a high congestion level. In this embodiment, the rate control bit from BS 206 may be common to all mobile stations 202 for which fee BS 206 is non-primary.<br>
[0040]	Note that the above approach spends very little power on forward link of non-<br>
primary base stations since fee UP command corresponds to no transmission on the rate control bit. A DOWN command from non-primary BS may be send only if the system<br><br>
WO 2005/039232	15	PCT/US2004/033787<br><br>
is severely congested, thereby providing some control to the non-primary base stations, mentioned as a drawback of the Case H. For example, if it is determined that the sector's ROT exceeds a predetermined value, such as 7 or 8 dB, then the non-primary BS is considered to be congested and it sends a rate command of -1 representing a DOWN rate command. Otherwise the non-primary BS is considered not congested and a rate command of 0 representing an UP command is sent. Because it is less likely for the system to be over-loaded for a long period of time, a DOWN command is send rarely. For most of the time, in this embodiment, a non-congested BS will send a rate command of 0, which is the same as sending no command. Because the non-congested BS sends no rate command, this technique therefore does not consume too much power from the non-primary sector.<br>
[0041]	Since this approach is asymmetric, the rate control in soft-handoff needs to be<br>
specified as in case of cell-switching as in Case II. During cell switching a more conservative approach may be followed. In an embodiment, the MS decodes the rate control bit(s) from both the primary BS 204 (the base station whose coverage area the MS is leaving) and non-primary BS 206 (the base station whose coverage area the MS is entering) as a tri-state value of -1, 0, or 1 representing DOWN, HOLD, UP respectively. The cell switching operation begins when the MS sends a CELL_SWITCH_INDICATOR signal indicating BS 206 as its new primary BS. During the period from the beginning of the switching operation until the MS receives an END_SWITCH_INDICATOR (acknowledgement from the base station indicating the switch operation is completed) or NUM_SOFT_SWITOHING_FRAMES indicators have been sent, the MS uses the same logic to interpret rate control bit(s) from both the BS 204 and BS 206. During this period, the MS applies OR-of-HOLD rule followed by OR-of-DOWN rule on the rate control commands from the BS 204 and BS 206. During the switching period, the MS 202 is not able to increase the rate even if the new primary BS 206 sends an UP command due to OR-of-HOLD rule. Thus the approach is conservative during the switching period.<br>
[0042]	In yet another embodiment, during the switching period, the MS 202 interprets<br>
the rate control command from BS 204 as a tri-state command (-1, 0, 1) while interpreting the rate control command from BS 206 as an ON-OFF command (-1, 0). After the MS 202 receives an END_SWICH_INDICATOR indicating BS 206 as its new primary BS or has sent NUM_SOFT_SWnCHING_FRAMES indicating the switch,<br><br>
WO 2005/039232	16		PCT/US2004/033787<br>
the MS starts interpreting rate control command from BS 204 as ON-OFF and rate control command from BS 206 as a tri-state command. This approach is more aggressive than the previously described techniques because it allows the BS 204 to increase the rate of the MS 202 before it decodes the CELL_SWITCH_INDICATOR. During the period, the CELL_SWlTCH_INDICATOR is decoded by a BS to the time the MS receives an END_SWICH_INDICATOR, the MS 202 is not able to increase the rate even if the new primary BS 206 sends an UP command since the rate control command from the previous primary BS 204 will be interpreted as HOLD by the MS. Techniques of Combining Multiple Rate Control Indicators<br>
[0043]	A generalized technique for combining multiple rate control indicators includes<br>
applying weighting factors to the different rate control commands received. For example, the primary base station may be assigned a larger weighting factor man non-primary base stations in a MS Active Set The weighted rate command indicators can then be combined to produce an aggregate rate command mat is used to control the data rate of the MS. As discussed above, Case HI corresponds to a case when equal weighting is applied to the rate control commands received from all the base stations in mobile stations active set Case IV is a special case of weighting applied to the rate control commands where 0 weighting is applied to the HOLD command from a non-primary BS. The different special cases of the weighting technique for interpreting and combining the rate control indicators the MS receives from its Active Set members are described below. <br>
Rate Control Combining Rules for Common/Group Rate Control<br>
[0044]	If a MS receives an ACK, or after its last subpacket, the MS decodes rate control<br>
indicators from all the F-RCCHs that have been assigned to the MS by members of the MS active set. Every rate control indicator has three states: DOWN, HOLD, and UP. The effect of a rate control command is to change the authorized T/P by certain amount, where authorized T/P is the maximum allowed "traffic to pilot" ratio that the mobile station is allowed to transmit at and is used as an indication of the MS data rate that can be supported. In one embodiment, the MS combines all the rate control indictors it receives based on the following OR-of-DOWN rules:<br>
If any indicator is a DOWN, then the MS decreases its authorized T/P by a predetermined amount from the current level.<br><br>
WO 2003M39232	17	PCT/IJS2004/033787<br><br><br><br><br>
•	     If no indicator is a DOWN and at least one indictor is a HOLD, then the MS <br>
   maintains the current authorized T/P level.<br>
§	Otherwise, all indicators are UP and the MS increases its authorized T/P by a   predetermined amount from the current level.<br>
[0045]	It is noted that the predetermined amounts that a MS increases or decreases from<br>
its current authorized T/P may be the same, or they may be different depending on the current authorized T/P of the MS. <br>
Rate Control Combining Rules for Dedicated Rate Control<br>
[0046]	For dedicated rate control, if a MS receives an ACK on the F-ACKCH from a<br>
BS, it decodes all the F-RCCHs that are assigned to the MS, regardless of whether or not the MS receives an ACK from a BS. The robustness of a communication system that uses this reception procedure can be improved using the following weighting techniques.<br>
•	The rate control indicator from me primary BS has three states: RATE_DECREASE, RATE_HOLD, and RATE_INCREASE.<br>
•	Rate control indicator from a non-primary BS has two states: RATEDECREASE and RATEJHOLD. This can be interpreted as a weighting technique where the RATEJHOLD and RATEJNCREASE state of rate control indicator from the non-primary BS is weighted by a NULL factor.<br>
•	MS combines desired rate control indictors based on the following rules:<br>
o   If any indicator is a RATE_DECRE ASE, then the MS decreases its rate by a<br>
desired amount, for example by one.<br>
                       o   If no indicator is a RATE_DECREASE and at least one indictor is a<br>
                           RATEJHOLD, then the MS maintains the current rate,<br>
                      o   If no indicator is a RATE_DECREASE or a RATEJHOLD, and at least one<br>
                            indictor is a RATE_INCREASE, then the MS increases its rate by a desired<br>
                            amount, for example by one.<br>
                     o   Otherwise, all rate control indicators are RATE_HOLD and the MS<br>
                          maintains the current rate.<br>
[0047]	It is noted that the MS combines desired rate control indicators which can<br>
include the rate control indicators of all of the MS active set members, or can include the rate control indicators of only some of the MS active set members. <br>
Procedure during Cell Switching for Dedicated Rate Control;<br><br>
WO 2005/039232	18	PCT/US2004/033787<br>
[0048]	After    a    MS    initiates    a    cell    switching    operating    by   sending    a<br>
OTLL SWITCHJNDICATOR, the MS assumes that the control rate indicators from both the old primary BS and the new primary BS each have three states: RATE_DECREASE, RATEJHOLD, and RATEINCREASE. The rate control indicators from all other non-primary BS remains unchanged, and have two states: RATE_DECREASE and NULL INDICATION. The rate control indicators are combined using the same combining rules described immediately above.<br>
|0049]	Upon    receiving    an    END_SWITCH_INDICATOR, or    after    sending<br>
NUM_SOFT_SWITCHING_FRAMES, the MS assumes that the rate control indicator from the new primary BS has three states: RATE_DECREASE, RATE_HOLD, and RATE_INCREASE. The rate control indicators from all other non-primary BSs, including the old primary BS, have two states: RATE_DECREASE and NULL_INDICATION. The rate control indicators are combined based on the same combining rules described immediately above.<br>
[0050]	An alternative approach is to define the states of the F-RCCH from a non-<br>
primary BS "on the fly" based on what is received on the corresponding F-ACKCH from the associated BS. For this approach the following procedure is used:<br>
•	If an ACK is received from an F-ACKCH, men the MS interprets that the corresponding F-RCCH from the same non-primary BS has three states: RATE_DECREASE, RATEJHOLD, and RATEJNCREASE.<br>
•	If no ACK is received from an F-ACKCH (after last subpacket), then the MS interprets that the corresponding F-RCCH from the same non-primary BS has two states: RATE_DECREASE and NULL_INDICATION.<br>
[0051]	All other rules for combining remain the same as described immediately above.<br>
[0052]	Figure 3 is a flow chart illustrating a technique for combining rate control<br>
indicators for common/group rate control. In a common/group rate control scheme, one rate control command is sent that is monitored by all the mobile stations or a group of mobile stations in the coverage area of the base station. Flow begins in block 302. hi block 304 a MS decodes rate control indicators received from members of the MS active set of a BS. In block 306 the MS determines if any of the rate control indicators is an AUTHORIZED_T2P_DECREASE (DOWN rate control command). If at least one of the indicators is an AUTHORIZEDJT2PDECREASE, a "YES" outcome, then flow continues to block 308. In block 308 the MS decreases its authorized T/P (Traffic<br><br>
WO 2005/039232	19	PCT/IIS2004/033787<br>
to Pilot) level by a predetermined amount. Flow then continues to block 310 where the combining process ends.<br>
|0053J	Returning     to     block     306, if    none     of    the     indicators     is     an<br>
AUTHORIZED_T2P_DECREASE, a "NO" outcome, then flow continues to block 312. In block 312, the MS determines if any of the rate control indicators is an AUTHORIZEDT2PHOLD (HOLD rate control command). If at least one of the indicators is an AUTHORIZED_T2P HOLD, a "YES" outcome, then flow continues to block 314. In block 314 the MS maintains its current authorized T/P level. Flow then continues to block 310 where the process ends.<br>
10054]	Returning    to    block     312, if    none     of    the    indicators    is     an<br>
AUTHORIZEDT2PHOLD, a "NO" outcome, then all of the indicators must be AUTHORIZEDJT2PINCREASE (UP rate control command) because the indicators can only be one of three values, either AUTHORIZED T2P DECREASE, AUTHORIZED_T2P_HOLD, or AUTHORIZED_T2P_INCREASE.' Therefore, m block 312, if none of the indicators is an AUTHORIZED T2P_HOLD, flow continues to block 316. In block 316 the MS increases its authorized T/P by a predetermined amount Flow then continues to block 310 where the process ends.<br>
[0055]	Figure 4 is a flow chart illustrating a technique for combining rate control for a<br>
dedicated rate control approach. In the dedicated rate control approach, a separate rate control command specific to each mobile station is sent for all MS. Flow begins in block 402. In block 404 a MS decodes rate control indicators received from primary and non-primary BS. A rate control indicator from a primary BS can either be a RATE_DECREASE, RATE_HOLD, or RATE_INCREASE. A rate control indicator from a non-primary BS can be either RATE_DECREASE or NULL_INDICATION. Flow continues to block 406. In block 406 the MS determines if any of the rate control indicators is a RATE_DECREASE. If at least one of the indicators is an RATE_DECREASE, a "YES" outcome at block 406, then flow continues to block 408. In block 408 the MS decreases its data rate. For example, the MS may decrease its data rate by a value of one. Flow then continues to block 410 where the combining process ends.<br>
[0056]	Returning to block 406, if none of the indicators is an RATEDECREASE, a<br>
"NO" outcome at block 406, then flow continues to block 412. In block 412, the MS determines if the rate control indicator from the primary BS is a RATE_HOLD. If at<br><br>
WO 2005/039232	PCT/US2004/033787<br>
least one of the indicators is an RATE_HOLD, then flow continues to block 414. In block 414 the MS maintains its current data rate. Flow then continues to block 410 where the process ends.<br>
|0057]	Returning to block 412, if none of the indicators is a RATE_HOLD, a "NO"<br>
outcome, then flow continues to block 416. In block 416, since none of the indicators is RATE_DECREASE and the indicator from primary BS is not a RATE_HOLD, the MS increases its data rate. Flow then continues to block 410 where the process ends.<br>

accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The communication device 502 includes a network interface 506, digital signal processor (DSP) 508, a host processor 510, a memory device 512, a program product 514, and a user interface 516.<br>
