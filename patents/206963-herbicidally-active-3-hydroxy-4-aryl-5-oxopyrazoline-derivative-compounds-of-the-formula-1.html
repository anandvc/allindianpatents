The halogen, alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkoxy, alkylthio, alkylcarbonyl, alkylsulfonyl and (di)alkyiamino radicals which may be present in the radicals R34, in particular -SO2R34 (G), are derived from the corresponding radicals mentioned above. Preferred heterocyclyl radicals are those containing 1 or 2 heteroatoms, for example N, S or O. They are usually saturated.

The C2-C2oalkenyl and alkynyl groups R34 may be mono- or polyunsaturated. They preferably contain 2 to 12, in particular 2 to 6, carbon atoms. For illustration, suitable groups -SO2R34 are given in the example below:<br><br><br><br><br><br>
The free valency on the left hand of the groups Zi, Z2 and Z3 is linked to the 1-position and the free valency on the right hand is linked to the 2-position of the pyrazoline ring.<br>

Among the compounds of the formula I, preference is given to those in which G is hydrogen. In a particularly preferred group of compounds of the formula I, R4 and R5 together form a group Z2. Also of particular interest are compounds of the formula I in which R1f R2 and R3 independently of one another are halogen, CrC4alkyl, C2-C4alkenyl, C2-C4alkynyl or CrC6-alkoxy.

The salts of the compounds of the formula I with acidic hydrogen also include alkali metal salts, for example sodium salts and potassium salts; alkaline earth metal salts, for example calcium salts and magnesium salts; ammonium salts, i.e. unsubstituted ammonium salts and mono- or polysubstituted ammonium salts, and salts with other organic nitrogen bases. Correspondingly, suitable salt formers are alkali metal and alkaline earth metal hydroxides, in particular the hydroxides of lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium or calcium, where those of sodium or potassium are particularly important.<br>

In the processes described in this application, unless chiral starting materials are employed, the unsymmetrically substituted compounds of the formula I are generally obtained as racemates. The stereoisomers can then be separated by known methods, such as fractional crystallization after salt formation with optically pure bases, acids or metal complexes, or else by chromatographic processes such as high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) on acetylcellulose, owing to their physicochemical properties. In the present invention, the active compounds of the formula I are to be understood as meaning both the enriched and optically pure forms of the stereoisomers in question, and the racemates or diastereomers. Unless specific reference is made to the individual optical isomers, the given formula is to be understood as meaning those racemic mixtures which are formed in the preparation process mentioned. If an aliphatic C=C double bond is present, geometrical isomerism may additionally occur.<br>
Also depending on the type of the substituents, the compounds of the formula I may be present as geometrical and/or optical isomers and isomer mixtures, and also as tautomers and mixtures of tautomers. These compounds of the formula I likewise form part of the subject-matter of the present invention. The compounds of the formula I in which the group G is hydrogen may, for example, be present in the following tautomer equilibriums:<br><br><br>
If G is different from hydrogen and Z is the group Zi or Z3, or if G is different from hydrogen and Z2is unsymmetrically substituted, fused or spiro-linked, the compound of the formula I may be present as an isomer of the formula Id<br>

Processes for preparing compounds which, with respect to the meaning of the substituents R4 and R5, are different from the compounds of the formula I according to the present invention are, for example, described in WO 96/21652. The compounds of the formula I according to the present invention can be prepared by methods similar to the processes described in WO 96/21652. The compounds of the formula II<br><br><br>

The compounds of the formula III are either known, or they can be prepared similarly to known processes. Processes for preparing compounds of the formula III and their reaction with hydrazines are described, for example, in WO 97/02243 . Compounds of the formula III in which R is C1-C6alkyl, C1-C6haloalkyl, preferably methyl, ethyl or trichloroethyl, and R1, R2 and R3 are as defined under formula I can be prepared by methods known to the person skilled in the art. For example, compounds of the formula III in which R is C1-C6alkyl, C1-C6haloalkyl, preferably methyl, ethyl or trichloroethyl, and R1, R2 and R3 independently of one<br><br>
another are C1-C4alkyl, C2-C4alkenyl, C2-C4alkynyl can be prepared by the process of cross-coupling according to Stille (J.K. Stille, Angew. Chem. 1986. 98, 504-519), Sonogashira (K. Sonogashira et al., Tetrahedron Lett. 1975. 4467-4470), Suzuki (N. Miyaura, A. Suzuki, Chem. Rev. 1995. 95, 2457-2483) or Heck (R.F. Heck, Org. React. 1982. 27, 345-390), with or without subsequent hydrogenation. This procedure is illustrated by the following reaction scheme:<br><br>
The compounds of the formulae IV and IVa are either known, or they can be prepared by known processes. Processes for preparing compounds of the formula IV are described, for example, in WO 95/00521. These compounds can be prepared, for example, by heating a compound of the formula V <br>
in which R42 is hydrogen, CrC4alkyl, CrC6alkoxy, Ci-C6haloalkoxy, benzyloxy, preferably hydrogen, methyl, methoxy, ethoxy, trichloroethoxy, tert-butoxy or benzyloxy and R4 and R5 are as defined under formula I in the presence of a base or an acid in an inert solvent. Compounds of the formula V in which R42 is hydrogen, CrC4alkyl, CrC6alkoxy, d-C6haloalkoxy, benzyloxy, preferably hydrogen, methyl, methoxy, ethoxy, trichloroethoxy, tert-butoxy or benzyloxy and R4 and R5are as defined under formula I can be prepared, for example, by reacting a compound of the formula VI<br><br><br>

In the formula VII, the free valencies of the groups Zi,Z2andZ3are in each case attached to the group Y. Compounds of the formula VI and VII are known, or they can be prepared by methods known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
Compounds of the formula IV in which R4 and R5 together are a group Z2<br>
-C-Ri4(Ri5)-C-R16(Ri7)-0-C-Rl8(Ri9)-C-R2o(R2i)- (Z2), in which R14, R15, Rie, R17, R18, R19, R20 and R2i are hydrogen can be prepared, for example, according to the following reaction scheme:<br><br>
Compounds of the formula I in which R4 and R5 are a group Zn or Z3 can be prepared using the methods of the synthesis examples given above. Thus, the compounds of the formula III can, for example, be reacted with a hydrazine alkanol of the formula IV(b)<br><br><br>
(here, R6-Ri3 and R22-R29 are hydrogen) to give the compounds of the formula IVc<br><br>
followed by a cyclization, for example with formaldehyde, to give the end products of the formula le<br><br>
The compound of the formula le in which R1 and R3 are ethyl and R2 is methyl has a melting point of 186-191 °C (decomp.). Similarly, it is also possible to prepare compounds of the formula I in which the substituents R6-R13 and R22-R29 are different from hydrogen and, independently of one another, have one of the meanings mentioned for them above.<br>
The end products of the formula I can be isolated in a customary manner by concentration and/or evaporation of the solvent and be purified by recrystallization or trituration of the solid residue in solvents in which they are not readily soluble, such as ethers, alkanes, aromatic hydrocarbons or chlorinated hydrocarbons, or by chromatography. Salts of compounds of the formula I can be prepared in a manner known per se. Such preparation methods are described, for example, in WO 96/21652.<br>
The compounds of the formula I or compositions comprising them can be used according to the invention by all the application methods customary in agriculture, for example pre-emergence application, postemergence application and seed dressing, and various methods and techniques, for example controlled release of active compounds. To this end, the active compound is absorbed in solution onto mineral granule carriers or polymerized granules (urea/formaldehyde) and dried. If appropriate, a coating which allows the active compound to be released in metered form over a certain period of time can additionally be applied (coated granules).<br><br>
The compounds of the formula I can be employed as herbicides in unchanged form, i.e. as they are obtained in the synthesis, but they are preferably processed in a customary manner with the auxiliaries conventionally used in the art of formulation, for example to give emulsifiable concentrates, directly sprayable or dilutable solutions, dilute emulsions, wettable powders, soluble powders, dusts, granules or microcapsules. Such formulations are described, for example, in WO 97/34485 on pages 9 to 13. The methods of application, such as spraying, atomizing, dusting, wetting, scattering or watering, in the same way as the nature of the compositions, are chosen according to the required aims and the given circumstances.<br>
The formulations, i.e. the compositions, formulations or preparations comprising the active compound of the formula I or at least one active compound of the formula I and as a rule one or more solid or liquid formulation auxiliaries, are prepared in a known manner, for example by intimate mixing and/or grinding of the active compounds with the formulation auxiliaries, for example solvents or solid carriers. Surface-active compounds (surfactants) can furthermore additionally be used during the preparation of the formulations. Examples of solvents and solid carriers are given, for example, in WO 97/34485 on page 6. Depending on the nature of the active compound of the formula I to be formulated, suitable surface-active compounds are nonionic, cationic and/or anionic surfactants and surfactant mixtures having good emulsifying, dispersing and wetting properties.<br>
Examples of suitable anionic, nonionic and cationic surfactants are listed, for example, in WO 97/34485 on pages 7 and 8.<br>
The surfactants conventionally used in the art of formulation and which can also be used to prepare the herbicidal compositions according to the invention are described, inter alia, in "Mc Cutcheon's Detergents and Emulsifiers Annual", MC Publishing Corp., Ridgewood New Jersey, 1981, Stache, H., "Tensid-Taschenbuch" [Surfactant handbook], Carl Hanser Verlag, Munich/Vienna, 1981 and M. and J. Ash, "Encyclopedia of Surfactants", Vol Mil, Chemical Publishing Co., New York, 1980-81.<br>
The efficacy of herbicidal and plant-growth-inhibiting compositions according to the invention containing a herbicidally effective amount of a compound of the formula I can be enhanced by addition of spray tank adjuvants.<br><br>
These adjuvants may be, for example: nonionic surfactants, mixtures of nonionic surfactants, mixtures of anionic surfactants with nonionic surfactants, cationic surfactants, organosilicon surfactants, mineral oil derivatives with and without surfactants, vegetable oil derivatives with and without addition of surfactants, alkylated derivatives of oils of vegetable or mineral origin with and without surfactants, fish oils and other oils of animal nature and their alkyl derivatives with and without surfactants, natural higher fatty acids, preferably having 8 to 28 carbon atoms, and their alkyl ester derivatives, organic acids which contain an aromatic ring system and one or more carboxylic esters, and their alkyl derivatives, furthermore suspensions of polymers of vinyl acetate or copolymers of vinyl acetate/acrylic esters. Mixtures of individual adjuvants with one another and in combination with organic solvents may further increase the effect.<br>
Suitable nonionic surfactants are, for example, polyglycol ether derivatives of aliphatic or cycloaliphatic alcohols, saturated or unsaturated fatty acids and alkylphenols, preferably those which may contain 3 to 30 glycol ether groups and 8 to 20 carbon atoms in the (aliphatic) hydrocarbon radical and 6 to 18 carbon atoms in the alkyl radical of the alkylphenols.<br>
Other suitable nonionic surfactants are the water-soluble polyethylene oxide adducts on polypropylene glycol, ethylenediaminopolypropylene glycol and alkylpolypropylene glycol preferably having 1 to 10 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain which preferably contain 20 to 250 ethylene glycol ether groups and 10 to 100 propylene glycol ether groups. The abovementioned compounds generally contain 1 to 5 ethylene glycol units per propylene glycol unit.<br>
Other examples of nonionic surfactants which may be mentioned are nonylphenolpolyethoxyethanols, castor oil polyglycol ethers, polypropylene/polyethylene oxide adducts, tributylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol, polyethylene glycol and octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol.<br>
Also suitable are fatty esters of polyoxyethylene sorbitan, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan trioleate.<br>
Preferred anionic surfactants are, in particular, alkyl sulfates, alkyl sulfonates, alkylaryl sulfonates, alkylated phosphoric acids and their ethoxylated derivatives. The alkyl radicals usually contain 8 to 24 carbon atoms.<br><br>
Preferred nonionic surfactants are known under the following trade names:<br>
Polyoxyethylene cocoalkylamine (for example AMIET® 105 (Kao Co.)), polyoxyethylene oleylamine (for example AMIET® 415 (Kao Co.)), nonylphenolpolyethoxyethanols, polyoxyethylene stearylamine (for example AMIET® 320 (Kao Co.)), N-polyethoxyethylamines (for example GENAMIN® (Hoechst AG)), N,N,N',N'-tetra(polyethoxypolypropoxyethyl)ethylene diamines (for example TERRONIL®and TETRONIC® (BASF Wyandotte Corp.)), BRIJ® (Atlas Chemicals), ETHYLAN® CD and ETHYLAN® D (Diamond Shamrock), GENAPOL® C, GENAPOL® O, GENAPOL® S and GENAPOL® X080 (Hoechst AG), EMULGEN® 104P, EMULGEN® 109P and EMULGEN® 408 (Kao Co.); DISTY® 125 (Geronazzo), SOPROPHOR® CY 18 (Rhdne Poulenc S.A.); NONISOL® (Ciba-Geigy), MRYJ® (ICI); TWEEN® (ICI); EMULSOGEN® (Hoechst AG); AMIDOX® (Stephan Chemical Co.), ETHOMID® (Armak Co.); PLURONIC® (BASF Wyandotte Corp.), SOPROPHOR® 461P (Rhdne Poulenc S.A.), SOPROPHOR® 496/P (Rhone Poulenc S.A.), ANTAROX FM-63 (Rhone Poulenc S.A.), SLYGARD 309 (Dow Corning), SILWET 408, SILWET L-7607N (Osi-Specialities).<br>
The cationic surfactants are primarily quaternary ammonium salts which contain, as N-substituents, at least one alkyl radical having 8 to 22 C atoms and, as further substituents, lower nonhalogenated or halogenated alkyl, benzyl or lower hydroxyalkyl radicals. The salts are preferably present as halides, methyl sulfates or ethyl sulfates, for example stearyltrimethylammonium chloride or benzyldi(2-chloroethyl)ethylammonium bromide.<br>
The oils used are either of mineral or natural origin. The natural oils may additionally be of animal or vegetable origin. In the case of animal oils, preference is given, in particular, to derivatives of beef tallow, but fish oils (for example sardine oil) and derivatives thereof are also used. Vegetable oils are mainly seed oils of various origin. Examples of particularly preferred vegetable oils which may be mentioned are coconut, rapeseed or sunflower oils and derivatives thereof.<br>
Surfactants, oils, in particlar vegetable oils, derivatives thereof such as alkylated fatty acids and mixtures thereof, for example with preferably anionic surfactants such as alkylated phosphoric acids, alkyl sulfates and alkylaryl sulfonates and higher fatty acids which are customary in formulation and adjuvant technique and which can also be employed in the compositions according to the invention and spray tank solutions thereof are described, inter<br><br>

The herbicidal formulations as a rule comprise 0.1 to 99% by weight, in particular 0.1 to 95% by weight, of herbicide, 1 to 99.9% by weight, in particular 5 to 99.8% by weight, of a solid or liquid formulation auxiliary and 0 to 25% by weight, in particular 0.1 to 25% by weight, of a surfactant. While concentrated compositions are rather preferred as commercial goods, the end user as a rule uses dilute compositions. The compositions can also comprise further additives, such as stabilizers, for example epoxidized or non-epoxidized vegetable oils (epoxidized coconut oil, rapeseed oil or soya oil), defoamers, for example silicone oil, preservatives, viscosity regulators, binders, tackifiers and fertilizers or other active compounds.<br>
The herbicidally active compounds of the formula I are as a rule applied to the plants or their habitat, at application rates of 0.001 to 4 kg/ha, in particular 0.005 to 2 kg/ha. The dosage required for the desired effect can be determined by tests. It depends on the nature of the effect, the development stage of the crop plant and the weed and on the application (location, time, process) and can, as a function of these parameters, vary within wide ranges.<br>
The compounds of the formula I have herbicidal and growth-inhibiting properties, owing to which they can be used in crops of useful plants, in particular in cereals, cotton, soya, sugar beet, sugar cane, plantings, rapeseed, maize and rice, very particularly in maize and cereals, and for the non-selective control of weeds. Crops include those which have been rendered tolerant towards herbicides or herbicide classes by conventional breeding methods or genetical engineering methods. The weeds to be controlled can be both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous weeds, for example Stellaria, Agrostis, Digitaria, Avena, Brachiaria, Phalaris, Setaria, Sinapis, Lolium, Solanum, Echinochloa, Scirpus, Monochoria, Sagittaria, Panicum, Bromus, Alopecurus, Sorghum halepense, Sorghum bicolor, Rottboellia, Cyperus, Abutilon, Sida, Xanthium, Amaranthus, Chenopodium, Ipomoea, Chrysanthemum, Galium, Viola, Matricharia, Papaver and Veronica. The herbicidal composition according to the<br><br>
invention is particularly suitable for controlling Alopecurus, Avena, Agrostis, Setaria, Phalaris, Lolium, Panicum, Echinochloa, Brachiaria and Digitaria.<br>
Surprisingly, it has been found that specific safeners known from US-A-5 041 157, US-A-5-541 148, US-A-5 006 656, EP-A-0 094 349, EP-A-0 551 650, EP-A-0 268 554, EP-A-0 375 061, EP-A-0 174 562, EP-A-492 366, WO 91/7874, WO 94/987, DE-A-19 612 943, WO 96/29870, WO 98/13361, WO 98/39297, WO 98/27049, EP 716 073, EP 613 618, US-A-5 597 776 and EP-A-430 004 are suitable for mixing with the herbicidal composition according to the invention. Consequently, the present invention also relates to a selective herbicidal composition for controlling grasses and weeds in crops of useful plants, in particular in crops of maize and cereals, said composition comprising a herbicide of the formula I and a safener (antidote) and which protects the useful plants, but not the weeds, against the phytotoxic effect of the herbicide, and to the use of this composition for controlling weeds in crops of useful plants.<br>

in which R44 and R45 independently of one another are hydrogen or halogen and R46, R47 and R48 independently of one another are CrC4alkyl.<br>
The abovementioned preferences for the compounds of the formula I also apply to mixtures of the compounds of the formula I with safeners of the formulae X to XVIII. Preferred compositions according to the invention comprise a safener selected from the group consisting of the formula Xa<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The invention also relates to a method for the selective control of weeds in crops of useful plants which comprises treating the useful plants, their seeds or seedlings or the area on which they are cultivated jointly or separately with a herbicidally effective amount of the herbicide of the formula I and a herbicide-antagonistically effective amount of the safener of the formula X, XI, XII, XIII, XIV, XV, XVI, XVII or XVIII.<br>
Crop plants which can be protected against the damaging effect of the abovementioned herbicides by the safeners of the formula X, XI, XII, XIII, XIV, XV, XVI, XVII or XVIII are, in particular, cereals, cotton, soya, sugarbeet, sugarcane, plantings, rapeseed, maize and rice, very particularly maize and cereals. Crops are to be understood as including those which have been rendered tolerant towards herbicides or classes of herbicides by conventional breeding methods or genetical engineering methods.<br>
The weeds to be controlled can be both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous weeds, for example the monocotyledonous weeds Avena, Agrostis, Phalaris, Lolium, Bromus, Alopecurus, Setaria, Digitaria Brachiaria, Echinochloa, Panicum, Sorghum halTbic, Rottboellia, Cyperus, Brachiaria, Scirpus, Monochoria, Sagittaria, and Stellaria and the dicotyledonous weeds Sinapis, Chenopodium, Galium, Viola, Veronica, Matricaria, Papaver, Solanum, Abutilon, Sida, Xanthium, Amaranthus, Ipomoea and Chrysanthemum.<br><br>
Areas under cultivation are the areas on which the crop plants are already growing, or on which the seeds of these crop plants have been sown, and also the soils which are intended to be cultivated with these crop plants.<br>
Depending on the intended use, a safener of the formula X, XI, XII, XIII, XIV, XV, XVI, XVII or XVIII can be employed for pretreating the seeds of the crop plant (dressing of the seeds or the seedlings), or it can be worked into the soil before or after seeding. However, it can also be applied on its own or together with the herbicide after the plants have emerged. Thus, the treatment of the plants or the seeds with the safener can, in principle, be carried out independently of when the herbicide is applied. However, the plant can also be treated by simultaneous application of herbicide and safener (for example as tank mix). The application rate of safener to herbicide to be applied depends essentially on the type of application. In a field treatment which is carried out either by using a tank mix of a combination of safener and herbicide or by separate application of safener and herbicide, the ratio of herbicide to safener is as a rule from 100:1 to 1:10, preferably from 20:1 to 1:1. As a rule, 0.001 to 1.0 kg of safener/ha, preferably 0.001 to 0.25 kg of safener/ha are applied in the field treatment.<br>
The application rates of herbicide are as a rule between 0.001 and 2 kg/ha, but preferably      v between 0.005 to 0.5 kg/ha.<br>
The compositions according to the invention are suitable for all application methods which are customary in agriculture, for example preemergence application, postemergence application and seed dressing.<br>
For seed dressing, generally 0.001 to 10 g of safener/kg of seed, preferably 0.05 to 2 g of safener/kg of seed, are applied. If the safener is applied in liquid form while swelling the seeds shortly before seeding, it is advantageous to employ safener solutions which comprise the active compound in a concentration of from 1 to 10000, preferably from 100 to 1000, ppm.<br>
For application, the safeners of the formula X, XI, XII, XIII, XIV, XV, XVI, XVII or XVIII or combinations of these safeners with the herbicides of the formula I are advantageously processed together with auxiliaries conventionally used in the art of formulation, for example to give emulsion concentrates, spreadable pastes, directly sprayable or dilutable solutions, dilute emulsions, wettable powders, soluble powders, dusts, granules or microcapsules.<br><br>
Such formulations are described, for example, in WO 97/34485 on pages 9 to 13. The formulations are prepared in a known manner, for example by intimate mixing and/or grinding of the active compounds with liquid or solid formulation auxiliaries, for example solvents or solid carriers. Surface-active compounds (surfactants) can furthermore additionally be used during preparation of the formulations. Solvents and solid carriers which are suitable for this purpose are mentioned, for example, in WO 97/34485 on page 6.<br>
Suitable surface-active compounds are, depending on the nature of the active compound of the formula I to be formulated, nonionic, cationic and/or anionic surfactants and surfactant mixtures having good emulsifying, dispersing and wetting properties. Examples of suitable anionic, nonionic and cationic surfactants are listed, for example, in WO 97/34485  on pages 7 and 8. The surfactants conventionally used in the art of formulation and which can also be used in the preparation of the herbicidal compositions according to the invention are described, inter alia, in "Mc Cutcheon's Detergents and Emulsifiers Annual", MC Publishing Corp., Ridgewood New Jersey, 1981, Stache, HM "Tensid-Taschenbuch" [Surfactant handbook], Carl Hanser Verlag, Munich/Vienna, 1981 and M. and J. Ash, "Encyclopedia of Surfactants", Vol Mil, Chemical Publishing Co., New York, 1980-81.<br>
The herbicidal formulations as a rule comprise 0.1 to 99% by weight, in particular 0.1 to 95% by weight, of the active compound mixture of the compound of the formula I with the compounds of the formulae X, XI, XII, XIII, XIV, XV, XVI, XVII or XVIII, 1 to 99.9% by weight of a solid or liquid formulation auxiliary and 0 to 25% by weight, in particular 0.1 to 25% by weight, of a surfactant. While concentrated compositions are usually preferred as commercial goods, the end user as a rule uses dilute compositions.<br>
The compositions can also comprise further additives, such as stabilizers, for example epoxidized or non-epoxidized vegetable oils (epoxidized coconut oil, rapeseed oil or soya oil), defoamers, for example silicone oil, preservatives, viscosity regulators, binders, tackifiers and fertilizers or other active substances. For using safeners of the formula X, XI, XII, XIII, XIV, XV, XVI, XVII or XVIII or compositions comprising them to protect crop plants against damaging effects of herbicides of the formula I, various methods and techniques are suitable, for example the following:<br>
\) Seed dressing<br>
a) Dressing the seeds with an active compound of the formula X, XI, XII, XIII, XIV, XV, XVI,<br>
XVII or XVIII formulated as a wettable powder by shaking in a vessel until even distribution<br><br>
on the surface of the seeds is achieved (dry dressing). Here, approximately 1 to 500 g of active compound of the formula X, XI, XII, XIII, XIV, XV, XVI, XVII or XVIII (4 g to 2 kg of wettable powder) are employed per 100 kg of seed.<br>
b)	Dressing the seeds using an emulsion concentrate of the active compound of the formula X, XI, XII, XIII, XIV, XV, XVI, XVII or XVIII according to method a) (wet dressing).<br>
c)	Dressing by dipping the seeds for 1 to 72 hours into a liquor containing 1-1000 ppm of active compound of the formula X, XI, XII, Xtll, XIV, XV, XVI, XVII or XVIII, with or without subsequent drying of the seeds (dip dressing).<br>
Seed dressing or the treatment of the germinated seedling are the naturally preferred application methods, since the treatment with active compound is completely directed at the target culture. As a rule, 1 to 1000 g of antidote, preferably 5 to 250 g of antidote, are employed per 100 kg of seed, but, depending on the method, which also permits the addition of other active compounds or micronutrients, it is possible to deviate above or below the stated limit concentrations (repeat dressing).<br>
ii) Application as tank mix<br>
A liquid preparation of a mixture of antidote and herbicide (mutual ratio between 10:1 and 1:100) is employed, the application rate of herbicide being from 0.005 to 5.0 kg per hectare. Such tank mixes are applied before or after seeding.<br>
iii) Application in the seed farrow<br>
The active compound of the formula X, XI, XII, XIII, XIV, XV, XVI, XVII or XVIII is applied into the open seeded seed farrow as an emulsion concentrate, a wettable powder or as granules. After the seed farrow has been covered, the herbicide is applied in a customary manner by the pre-emergence method.<br>
iv) Controlled release of active compound<br>
The active compound of the formula X, XI, XII, XIII, XIV, XV, XVI, XVII or XVIII is absorbed in solution onto mineral granule carriers or polymerized granules (urea/formaldehyde) and dried. If appropriate, a coating which allows the active compound to be released in metered form over a certain period of time can be applied (coated granules).<br>
The efficacy of herbicidal and plant-growth-inhibiting compositions according to the invention comprising a herbicidally effective amount of a compound of the formula I and a herbicide-<br><br>
antagonistically effective amount of a compound of the formula X, XI, XII, XIII, XIV, XV, XVI, XVII or XVIII can be increased by addition of spray tank adjuvants.<br>

Over a period of one hour, a solution of 177.6 g of methanesulfonyl chloride and 400 ml of diethyl ether is added dropwise to a solution of 80.6 g (0.76 mol) of diethylene glycol and 159.9 g (1.58 mol) of triethylamine in 1500 ml of diethyl ether which had been cooled to -10°C, and during the addition, the temperature is kept below 5°C. The mixture is stirred at a temperature of 0°C for 30 minutes, and cooling is then removed. After 2 hours, at a temperature of 20°C, 12 ml of triethylamine and 12 ml of methanesulfonyl chloride are added, and stirring is continued for another 4 hours. The resulting white suspension is subsequently transferred onto a suction filter, and the residue is washed twice with 300 ml of diethyl ether. The filter cake is taken up in 2000 ml of ethyl acetate, and the suspension is stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes and then filtered again. The resulting filtrate is concentrated and the residue is used for the next reaction without any further purification. 216.5 g of the desired crude product (1) are obtained in the form of white crystals.<br>
Example H2:<br><br>
(1)	(2)	(3)<br>
A solution of 68.78 g (0.30 mol) of (2) in 140 ml of dimethylformamide is added dropwise for a period of 30 minutes to a suspension of 23.9 g (0.60 mol) of 60% sodium hydride in 500 ml of dimethylformamide which had been cooled to 5°C. Cooling is removed and the reaction mixture is stirred until it has reached a temperature of 20°C. The mixture is subsequently briefly heated to a temperature of from 30 to 40°C to bring the evolution of hydrogen to completion. After cooling to a temperature of from 0 to 5°C, a solution of 80 g (0.305 mol) of (1) in 160 ml of dimethylformamide is added dropwise over a period of 30 minutes, during<br><br>
which the temperature is kept at from 0 to 5°C. Cooling is removed and the reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 3 hours and at approximately 40°C for 45 minutes and then added to a mixture of saturated ammonium chloride solution, ice and tert-butyl methyl ether. The phases are separated and the organic phase is subsequently washed with water (2x). The organic phase is dried with sodium sulfate and evaporated, and the residue is dried further at a temperature of 40°C and under reduced pressure, giving 92.2 g of (3) in the form of a slightly yellow oil. The crude product is employed for the next reaction without any further purification.<br>
Example H3:<br><br>

160.5 ml of a 33% solution of hydrogen bromide in glacial acetic acid are added dropwise over a period of 30 minutes to a solution of 92.2 g (0.305 mol) of (3) in 1200 ml of diethyl ether which had been cooled to 0°C. Cooling is removed and the mixture is subsequently stirred at 20°C for 22 hours and then under reflux for 27 hours, the resulting white suspension is transferred onto a suction filter and washed with diethyl ether, and the filter residue is subsequently dried over P205 under reduced pressure at a temperature of from 50 to 60°C. The product (4) is obtained in a yield of 52.9 g in the form of a white solid.<br><br>
(4)	(5)	(6)<br>
71.8 g (0.71 mol) of triethylamine are added to a suspension of 40 g (0.15 mol) of (4) in 1000 ml of xylene, and the mixture is degassed (4 x vacuum/argon). The yellow suspension<br><br>
is subsequently heated to a temperature of 60°C and stirred for 3 hours. 42.5 g (0.15 mol) of<br>
(5)	are then added, and the mixture is heated to a bath temperature of 150°C to distil off<br>
excess triethylamine and the ethanol which is formed. After 3 hours, the reaction mixture is<br>
cooled to a temperature of 40°C and added to 500 ml of an ice/water mixture. Using 100 ml<br>
of aqueous 1N sodium hydroxide solution, the reaction mixture is made alkaline and the<br>
aqueous phase (which contains the product) is washed twice with ethyl acetate. The organic<br>
phase is reextracted twice using aqueous 1N sodium hydroxide solution, the aqueous<br>
phases are combined, the remaining xylene is distilled off and the combined aquoeus<br>
phases are adjusted to pH 2-3 using 4N HCI with cooling. The product which precipitates is<br>
transferred onto a suction filter, the filter cake is washed with water and briefly with hexane<br>
and is subsequently dried under reduced pressure at a temperature of 60°C over P205. This<br>
gives 34.6 g of (6) as a slightly beige solid of melting point 242-244°C (decomp.).<br>
Example H5:<br><br>
A catalytic amount of 4-dimethylaminopyridine is added to a solution of 3 g (10.4 mmol) of<br>
(6)	and 1.6 g (15.8 mmol) of triethylamine in 100 ml of tetrahydrofuran which had been<br>
cooled to a temperature of 0°C. 1.57 g (13.0 mmol) of pivaloyl chloride are subsequently<br>
added dropwise. The mixture is stirred at a temperature of 0°C for 30 minutes, cooling is<br>
removed, and the mixture is stirred for a further 60 minutes. The reaction mixture is<br>
subsequently poured into saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, and the organic<br>
phase is separated off. The organic phase is dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered off and<br>
concentrated. Chromatographic purification and recrystallization from diethyl ether gives<br>
2.94 g of (7) of melting point 135-136°C.<br><br>
Example H6: Preparation of<br><br>
First 36.7 g (0.116 mol) of tributylvinylstannane and then 2 g of tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium are added to a solution of 20 g of dimethyl 2-(2,6-dibromo-4-methyl-phenyl)malonate (52.6 mmol) in 400 ml of toluene (3 x degassed, vacuum/argon). The reaction mixture is then stirred at a temperature of from 90 to 95°C for 9 hours. Filtration through Hyflo and concentration on a rotary evaporator gives, after chromatographic purification, 15.3 g of (8) in the form of a yellow oil which is used for the next reaction without any further purification.<br><br>
At a temperature of from 20 to 25°C, 15.2 g of the compound (8) obtained according to Example H6 are hydrogenated with hydrogen over a palladium catalyst (using carbon as carrier, 7 g of 5% Pd/C) in 160 ml of tetrahydrofuran. After the hydrogenation has ended, the product is filtered through Hyflo, and the resulting filtrate is concentrated on a rotary evaporator. This gives 13.7 g of (9) in the form of yellow crystals of melting point 47 - 49°C.<br><br><br>
By the method of Preparation Example H4, but starting from 4.8 g (17.2 mmol) of the malonate (9), 4.56 g of the compound (10) are obtained as a solid of melting point 188-190°C.<br><br>
A catalytic amount of 4-dimethylaminopyridine is added to a solution of 1 g (3.2 mmol) of (10) and 0.65 g (6.4 mmol) of triethylamine in 30 ml of tetrahydrofuran which had been cooled to a temperature of 0°C. 0.49 g (4.1 mmol) of pivaloyl chloride is subsequently added dropwise. The mixture is stirred at a temperature of 0°C for 10 minutes, cooling is removed, and stirring is then continued for a further 90 minutes. The reaction mixture is poured into saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution and diluted with tert-butyl methyl ether, and the organic phase is separated off. The organic phase is dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered off and concentrated. Chromatographic purification gives 1.07 g of (11) in the form of a white solid of melting point 122-123°C.<br><br><br>
(12)	(13)<br>
67.8 g (0.59 mol) of methanesulfonyl chloride are added dropwise to a solution of 37.1 g (0.28 mol) of c/s-2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydrofuran (12) and 65.3 g (0.65 mol) of triethylamine in 400 ml of methylene chloride which had been cooled to 0-3°C, during which the temperature is kept below 7°C. The mixture is subsequently stirred at a temperature of 20°C overnight. The resulting white suspension is transferred onto a suction filter, the residue is washed with methylene chloride and the filtrate is concentrated. The residue is taken up in ethyl acetate, washed with water (2x) and with saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution (1x), dried (Na2S04) and concentrated. This gives 72.7 g of the dimesylate compound (13) as a crude oil which is employed for the next reaction without any further purification.<br>
The starting material (12) is known from the literature: see, for example, K. Naemura et al., Tetrahedron Asymmetry 1993, 4, 911-918.<br><br>

Example B1: Herbicidal action before emergence of the plants (pre-emergence action) Monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous weeds are sown in standard soil in plastic pots. Immediately after sowing, the test substances are applied (5001 of water/ha) as an aqueous suspension (prepared using a 25% wettable powder (Example F3, b)) or as an emulsion (prepared using a 25% emulsion concentrate (Example F1, c)). The application rate is 500 g of active substance/ha. The test plants are subsequently grown under optimum conditions in a greenhouse. 3 weeks after the application, evaluation is carried out using a nine-level scale of ratings (1 = complete damage, 9 = no effect). Ratings of 1 to 4 (in particular 1 to 3) mean a good to very good herbicidal action.<br>
