invention may, if appropriate, also be used as herbicides and microbicides, for<br>
15	example as fungicides, antimycotics and bactericides. If appropriate, they may also<br>
be used as intermediates or precursors for the synthesis of further active compounds.<br>
All plants and plant parts can be treated in accordance with the invention. Plants are to be understood as meaning in the present context all plants and plant populations<br>
20	such as desired and undesired wild plants or crop plants (inclusive of naturally<br>
occurring crop plants). Crop plants can be plants which can be obtained by conventional plant breeding and optimization methods or by biotechnological and recombinant methods or by combinations of these methods, inclusive of the transgenic plants and inclusive of the plant cultivars protectable or not protectable by<br>
25	plant breeders" rights. Plant parts are to be understood to mean all above-ground and<br>
underground parts and organs of plants, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root, examples which may be mentioned being leaves, needles, stalks, stems, flowers, fruit bodies, fruits, seeds, roots, tubers and rhizomes. The plant parts also include harvested material, and vegetative and generative propagation material, for example<br>
30	cuttings, tubers, rhizomes, offsets and seeds.<br><br>
Le A 35 557-Foreign Countries<br>
Treatment according to the invention of the plants and plant parts with the active<br>
compounds is carried out directly or by allowing the compounds to act on their<br>
surroundings, environment or storage space by the customary treatment methods, for<br>
example by immersion, spraying, evaporation, fogging, scattering, painting on and,<br>
5	in the case of propagation material, in particular in the case of seeds, also by applying<br>
one or more coats.<br>
The active compounds can be converted into the customary formulations, such as<br>
solutions, emulsions, wettable powders, suspensions, powders, dusts, pastes, soluble<br>
10	powders, granules, suspension-emulsion concentrates, natural and synthetic materials<br>
impregnated with active compound, and microencapsulations in polymeric substances.<br>
These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the active<br>
compounds with extenders, that is liquid solvents and/or solid carriers, optionally with<br>
15	the use of surfactants, that is emulsifiers and/or dispersants, and/or foam-formers.<br>
If the extender used is water, it is also possible to employ for example organic solvents as auxiliary solvents. Essentially, suitable liquid solvents are: aromatics such as xylene, toluene   or   alkylnaphthalenes,   chlorinated   aromatics   or   chlorinated   aliphatic<br>
20	hydrocarbons such as chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes or methylene chloride, aliphatic<br>
hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example petroleum fractions, mineral and vegetable oils, alcohols such as butanol or glycol and also their ethers and esters, ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents such as dimethylformamide and dimethyl<br>
25	sulphoxide, and also water.<br>
Suitable solid carriers are:<br>
for example ammonium salts and ground natural minerals such as kaolins, clays, talc,<br>
chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, and ground synthetic<br>
30	minerals, such as finely divided silica, alumina and silicates; suitable solid carriers for<br>
granules are: for example crushed and fractionated natural rocks such as calcite,<br><br>
Le A 35 557-Foreign Countries<br>
marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite, and also synthetic granules of inorganic and<br>
organic meals, and granules of organic material such as sawdust, coconut shells, maize<br>
cobs and tobacco stalks; suitable emulsifiers and/or foam-formers are: for example<br>
nonionic and anionic emulsifiers, such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters,<br>
5	polyoxyethylene  fatty  alcohol  ethers,  for  example  alkylaryl  polyglycol  ethers,<br>
alkylsulphonates, alkyl sulphates, arylsulphonates and also protein hydrolysates; suitable dispersants are for exampfe lignosulphite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br>
Tackifiers such as carboxymethylcellulose and natural and synthetic polymers in the<br>
10	form of powders, granules or latices, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and<br>
polyvinyl acetate, as well as natural phospholipids such as cephalins and lecithins, and synthetic phospholipids, can be used in the formulations. Other additives can be mineral and vegetable oils.<br>
15	It is possible to use colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide,<br>
titanium oxide and Prussian Blue, and organic dyes, such as alizarin dyes, azo dyes and metal phthalocyanine dyes, and trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc.<br>
20	The formulations generally comprise between 0.1 and 95% by weight of active<br>
compound, preferably between 0.5 and 90%.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention, as such or in their formulations can<br>
also be used as a mixture with known fungicides, bactericides, acaricides, nematicides,<br>
25	or insecticides, for example to widen the spectrum of activity or to prevent the<br>
development of resistance. In many cases, synergistic effects are achieved i.e., the efficacy of the mixture is greater than the efficacy of the individual components.<br>

20	A mixture with other known active compounds, such as herbicides, or with fertilizers<br>
and growth regulators is also possible.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention can furthermore be present when<br>
used as insecticides in their commercially available formulations and in the use forms<br>
25	prepared from these formulations, as a mixture with synergistic agents. Synergistic<br>
agents are compounds which increase the action of the active compounds, without it being necessary for the synergistic agent added to be active itself.<br>
The active compound content of the use forms prepared from the commercially<br>
30	available   formulations   can   vary   within   wide   limits.   The   active   compound<br><br>
Le A 35 557-Foreign Countries<br>
concentration of the use forms can be from 0.0000001 to 95% by weight of active compound, preferably between 0.0001 and 1% by weight.<br>
The compounds are employed in a customary manner appropriate for the use forms. 5<br>
When used against hygiene pests and pests of stored products, the active compound is distinguished by an excellent residual action on wood and clay as well as a good stability to alkali on limed substrates.<br>
10	As already mentioned above, it is possible to treat all plants and their parts according<br>
to the invention. In a preferred embodiment, wild plant species and plant cultivars, or those obtained by conventional biological breeding, such as crossing or protoplast fusion, and parts thereof, are treated. In a further preferred embodiment, transgenic plants and plant cultivars obtained by  genetic  engineering,  if appropriate  in<br>
15	combination with conventional methods (Genetically Modified Organisms), and<br>
parts thereof are treated. The term "parts" or "parts of plants" or "plant parts" has been explained above.<br>
Particularly preferably, plants of the plant cultivars which are  in each  case<br>
20	commercially available or in use are treated according to the invention. Plant<br>
cultivars are to be understood as meaning plants having novel properties ("traits") which have been obtained by conventional breeding, by mutagenesis or by recombinant DNA techniques. This can be varieties, bio- and genotypes.<br>
25	Depending on the plant species or plant cultivars, their location and growth<br>
conditions (soils, climate, vegetation period, diet), the treatment according to the invention may also result in superadditive ("synergistic") effects. Thus, for example, reduced application rates and/or a widening of the activity spectrum and/or an increase in the activity of the substances and compositions to be used according to<br>
30	the invention, better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures,<br>
increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering<br><br>

performance, easier harvesting, acceieraiea maiuration, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products are possible which exceed the effects which were actually to be expected. 5<br>
The transgenic plants or plant cultivars (i.e. those obtained by genetic engineering) which are preferably treated according to the invention include all plants which, in the genetic modification, received genetic material which imparted particularly advantageously useful traits to these plants. Examples of such traits are better plant<br>
10	growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to<br>
drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products.  Further and particularly emphasized<br>
15	examples of such traits are a better defence of the plants against animal and microbial<br>
pests, such as against insects, mites, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and/or viruses, and also increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds. Examples of transgenic plants which may be mentioned are the important crop plants, such as cereals (wheat, rice), maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton, oilseed rape<br>
20	and also fruit plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus fruits and grapevines), and<br>
particular emphasis is given to maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton and oilseed rape. Traits that are emphasized are in particular increased defence of the plants against insects by toxins formed in the plants, in particular those formed by the genetic material from Bacillus thuringiensis (for example by the genes CrylA(a), CrylA(b),<br>
25	CrylA(c), CryllA, CrylllA, CryIIIB2, Cry9c, Cry2Ab, Cry3Bb and CrylF and also<br>
combinations thereof) (hereinbelow referred to as "Bt plants"). Traits that are also particularly emphasized are the increased defence of the plants to fungi, bacteria and viruses by systemic acquired resistance (SAR), systemin, phytoalexins, elicitors and resistance genes and correspondingly expressed proteins and toxins. Traits that are<br>
30	furthermore particularly emphasized are the increased tolerance of the plants to<br>
certain herbicidally active compounds, for example imidazolinones, sulphonylureas,<br><br><br><br>
Le A 35 557-Foreign Countries<br>
glyphosate or phosphinotricin (for example the "PAT" gene). The genes which<br>
impart the desired traits in question can also be present in combination with one<br>
another in the transgenic plants. Examples of "Bt plants" which may be mentioned<br>
are maize varieties, cotton varieties, soya bean varieties and potato varieties which<br>
5	are sold under the trade names YIELD GARDÂ® (for example maize, cotton, soya<br>
beans), KnockOutÂ® (for example maize), StarLinkÂ® (for example maize), BollgardÂ® (cotton), NucotnÂ® (cotton) and NewLeafÂ® (potato). Examples of herbicide-tolerant plants which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties and soya bean varieties which are sold under the trade names Roundup ReadyÂ® (tolerance to<br>
10	glyphosate, for example maize, cotton, soya bean), Liberty LinkÂ® (tolerance to<br>
phosphinotricin, for example oilseed rape), IMIÂ® (tolerance to imidazolinones) and STSÂ® (tolerance to sulphonylureas, for example maize). Herbicide-resistant plants (plants bred in a conventional manner for herbicide tolerance) which may be mentioned include the varieties sold under the name ClearfieldÂ® (for example<br>
15	maize). Of course, these statements also apply to plant cultivars having these or still-<br>
to-be-developed genetic traits, which plants will be developed and/or marketed in the future.<br>
The plants listed can be treated according to the invention in a particularly<br>
20	advantageous manner with the compounds of the general formula (I) or the active<br>
compound mixtures according to the invention. The preferred ranges stated above for the active compounds or mixtures also apply to the treatment of these plants. Particular emphasis is given to the treatment of plants with the compounds or the mixtures specifically mentioned in the present text. 25<br>
The active compounds according to the invention act not only against plant, hygiene<br>
and stored product pests, but also in the veterinary medicine sector against animal<br>
