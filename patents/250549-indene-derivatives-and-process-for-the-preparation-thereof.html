				<td>INDENE DERIVATIVES AND PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION THEREOF<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a novel indene derivative, which is useful as a modulator of peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs), a process for the preparation thereof and a pharmaceutical composition containing same as an active ingredient.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs) are members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily and function as transcription factors regulating gene expression in the form of heterodimers with retinoid X receptors (RXRs). The PPARs are divided into three subtypes, "PPARa", "PPARy" and "PPAR8", and are generally involved in maintaining energy homeostasis in vertebrates through the control of fat and glucose metabolisms.<br>
Accordingly, many attempts have been made to develop PPARa and PPARy full agonists which are useful for the treatment and prevention of disorders modulated by PPARs, e.g., metabolic syndromes such as diabetes, obesity, arteriosclerosis, hyperlipidemia, hyperinsulinism and hypertension; inflammatory diseases such as osteoporosis, liver cirrhosis and asthma; and cancer.<br>
For example, it has been reported that thiazolidine-2,4-dione (TZD) and non-TZD-based full agonists on PPARy exhibit excellent blood glucose level- lowering effect in non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) mammal models (J. Med. Chem., 1999, 42, 3785.; Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 2000, 2453.; Chem. Pharm. Bull, 2002, 50, 1349.; Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 2002, 77.; J. Med. Chem., 2003, 46, 3581.).<br>
However, such PPARy full agonists are also known to cause adverse side effects including weight gain due to facilitation of fat cell differentiation, cardiac hypertrophy, edema and liver damage.<br>
Therefore, there exists a need to develop selective PPAR modulators (SPPARMs), which are capable of selectively controlling the activities of the PPARs without causing side effects (Molecular Cell, 2001, 8, 737; Molecular Endocrinology, 2003, 17, 662; Molecular Endocrinology, 2002, 16,2628).<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, it is a primary object of the present invention to provide a novel compound, which is capable of selectively modulating the activities of peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs), causing no adverse side effects.<br><br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a process for the preparation of said compound.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a pharmaceutical composition containing said compound as an active ingredient.<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a novel indene derivative of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof:<br>

Reaction Scheme (I <br><br>
wherein, (Figure Remove)<br><br>
RI to R7 have the same meanings as defined in formula (I), and X is halogen.<br>
In Reaction Scheme (I), a compound of formula (II) may be stirred with alkyl hydroxylamine having various substituents or its hydrochloride salt in the presence of a suitable base under a nitrogen atmosphere to obtain a compound of formula (I) until the compound of formula (II) is entirely consumed. At this time, 2 to 10 equivalents of alkyl hydroxylamine or its hydrochloride is used, and cis and trans compounds (geometric isomers) of formula (I) are obtained together. Examples of the desirable reaction solvent that can be used in this reaction are dimethylformamide, nitroethane, methanol or ethanol, and 2 to 10 equivalents of amines such as 2,6-lutidine or pyridine is used at a temperature in the range of 50 to 120Â°C for 12 to 36 hours, preferably in a pressure reactor.<br>
Alternatively, a compound of formula (II) can be stirred with hydroxylamine or its hydrochloride salt under in the presence of a suitable base to obtain a compound of formula (III) until the compound of formula (II) is entirely consumed. In this reaction, 2 to 10 equivalents of hydroxylamine or its hydrochloride salt is used. Examples of the desirable reaction solvent can be used in this reaction are methanol and ethanol, and 2 to 10 equivalents of amines such as pyridine is used at a temperature of 20 to 100Â°C for 3 to 12 hours.<br><br>
Also, a compound of formula (III) can be reacted with 1 to 3 equivalents of alkyl halide in a solvent such as dimethyl formamide or acetone in the presence of an inorganic base such as potassium carbonate to obtain a compound of formula (I). At this time, the alkoxy imine form of the compound of formula (IV) is synthesized together.<br>
In case the compound of formula (I) is synthesized according to Reaction Scheme (I), a mixture of geometric isomers comprising cis and trans compounds about the imine double bond is obtained, and each pure isomer can be isolated by column chromatography. Each of the cis and trans isomer can be converted to the other isomer under suitable reaction condition. For example, the cis or trans compound is converted partly to the other isomer when it is stirred for a long period of time in the presence of an inorganic base such as lithium hydroxide in an alcohol solvent such as methanol or ethanol. Most of the cis isomer is converted to the trans isomer in 1-2 hours when it is heated at 110Â°C in an organic solvent such as benzene, toluene or xylene. A similar isomer conversion reaction can be carried out phtochemically when an isomer is irradiated with intense visible or ultraviolet light.<br>

Test Example 1: PPARy activation test<br>
The activity for PPARy activation was examined as follows.<br>
The vector fused with the ligand binding domain of a human PPARy gene and the DNA binding site of a yeast GAL-4 gene, and luciferase reporter vector were simultaneously transfected in NIH/3T3 cell. The cells were cultured for 24hrs. The solution containing the cells at a concentration of 2xl04 cells/well was placed on a 96-well plate. Then, each of the test compounds of the present invention or the control group without test compounds was added thereto. After incubating for 24hrs, the cells were subjected to lysis. The luciferase activity of the resultant was then measured, and the activation activity of the test compound was expressed as ECso (the concentration at which 50% of the maximum activation was observed) to compute the activation intensities of the test compounds and the comparative compound, rosiglitazone, relative to PPARy. The results are shown in Table 5. Rosiglitazone having the formula (XX) was prepared according to the method described in J. Med. Chem. 1994, 37, 3997. Table 5<br><br>
(Table Remove)<br>
As shown in Table 5, the inventive compounds exhibited superior PPARy activation activities over the comparative compound, rosiglitazone.<br>
Test Example 2; Effectiveness in lowering blood glucose level<br>
The effectiveness in lowering blood glucose levels of the inventive compound was examined using ob/ob mice (male, 8-9 weeks old), a type 2 diabetes model animal which expresses signs of hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, and bred at in-house facilities of Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology.<br>
The hydrochloric acid salt of l-hydroxy-6-(2-morpholine-4-yl-ethoxy)-l,3-diphenyl-lH-indene-2-carbo-xylic acid ethyl ester prepared in Example 8 was suspended in saline/0.2% Tween 80. The resulting solution was intraperitoneally administered to the mice at a dose of 50 mg/kg, once a day for 5 days, or orally administered to the mice, at a dose of 100 mg/kg, twice a day for 14 days. Days 1, 3 and 5 were selected for intraperitoneal administration, and days 5, 10 and 14, for oral administration, to collect blood samples for measuring the blood glucose levels. The extent of inhibition of the inventive compound relative to the control (saline-0.2% Tween 80 in the absence of the compound) is shown in Table 6. Upon the completion of the oral administration for 14 days, the mice were fasted for 16 hrs to perform OGTT(Oral Glucose Tolerance Test) to determine the changes in insulin sensitivity induced by the oral administration. After administrating glucose to the mice at a dose of 2g/kg orally, blood samples were collected at 0, 15, 30 60 and 120 minutes to measure blood glucose levels. The change in the total amount of blood glucose was computed over the 120-minute period to assess the extent of enhancing glucose clearance rates by compound treatment. The results are shown in Table 6, as % inhibition of total amount of blood glucose by the compound treatment relative to the untreated group.<br>
Table 6<br><br>
Moreover, C57/BL6J mice (male, 4 weeks old) which received high fat diet (60% fat) for 10-11 weeks and showed hyperglycemia and insulin resistance were chosen to carry out similar experiments (oral administration for 14 days but once a day) as described above. The extents of suppression of blood glucose and insulin levels were measured as mentioned above. The results are shown in Table 7. To check possible adverse side effects caused by the administration of the compound, the weight, heart weight and liver weight of each mouse were measured. GPT and GOT values were also calculated by employing a kit available in the market. The results are listed in Table 8.<br>
Table 7<br><br>
Table 8(Table Remove)<br>
As shown in Tables 6, 7, and 8, the inventive compound has an excellent effect in lowering both blood glucose and insulin levels, when it is administered by either orally or intraperitoneally with no side effects such as weight gain, hepatotoxicity or cardiotoxicity.<br>
