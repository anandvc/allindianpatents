TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
TETRAHYDROPYRAN^X CYCLOPENTYL TETRAHYDROPYRIDOPYRIDINE<br>
MODULATORS OF CHEMOKINE RECEPTOR ACTIVTIY<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The chemokines are a family of small (70-120 amino acids), proinflammatory cytoldnes, with potent chemotactic activities, Chemokines are chemotactic cytokines that are released by a wide variety of cells to attract various cells, such as monocytes, macrophages, T cells, eosinophils, basophils and neutrophils to sites of infiammation (reviewed in Schall, Cytokine. 3, 165-1S3 (1991) and Murphy, Rev. Immun.. 12, 593-633 (1994)}. These molecules were originally defined by four conserved cysteines and divided into two subfamilies based on the arrangement of the first cysteine pair.   In the CXC-chemoldne family, which includes IL-S, GROα, NAP-2 and IP-10, these two cysteines are separated by a single amino acid, while in the CC-chemoldne farnily, which includes RANTES, MCP-l, MCP-2, MCP-3, MlP-lα, MIP-IB and eotaxin, these two residues are adjacent.<br>
The chemoldnes are secreted by a wide varietv of cell types and bind to specific G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) (reviewed in Horuk, Trends Pharm. ScL, 15,159-165 (1994)) present on leukocytes and other cells. These chemokine receptors form a sub-family of GPCRs, which, at present, consists of fifteen characterized members and a number of orphans. Unlike receptors for promiscuous chemoattractants such as C5a, fMLP, PAF, and LTB4, chemokine receptors are more selectively expressed on subsets of leukocytes- Thus, generation of specific chemokines provides a mechanism for recruitment of particular leukocyte subsets.<br>
On binding their cognate ligands, chemokine receptors transduce an intracellular signal though the associated trimeric G protein, resulting in a rapid increase in intracellular calcium concentration. There are at least seven human chemokine receptors that bind or respond to P-chemokines with the following characteristic pattern: CCR-1 (or"CKR-l"or "CC-CKR-f'} [MlP-lct, M1P-1|3, MCP-3, RANTES] (Ben-Barruch, et al., J. Biol. Chem.. 270,22123-22128 (1995); Beote, et al. Cell, 72, 415-425 (1993)); CCR-2A and CCR-2E (or "CKR-2A"/"CKR-2A" or "CC-CKR-2A'V"CC-CKI1-2A") [MCP-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, MCP-4]; CCR-3 (or '^CKR-3" or "CC-CKR-3") [Eotaxin, Eotaxin 2, RANTES, MCP-2, MCP-3] (Rollins, et al., Blood, 90, 90S-92S (1997)); CCR-4 (or 'CKR-4" or "CC-CKR-4"} [MlP-la, RANTES, MCP-i] (Rollins, et al, Blood, 90, 90S-92S (1997)): CCR-5 (or<br><br>
immunoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Accordinsly. agents which modulate chemoldne receptors such as the CCR-2 receptor would be useful in such disorders and diseases. In addition, the recruitment of monocytes to inflammatory lesions in the vascular wall is a major component of the pathogenesis of atherogenic plaque formation. MCP-I is produced and secreted by endothelial cells and intimal smooth muscle cells after injury to the vascular wall in hypercholesterolemjc conditions. Monocytes recruited to the site of injury infiltrate the vascular wall and differentiate to foam cells in response to the released WCP-l. Several groups have now demonstrated that aortic lesion size, macrophage content and necrosis are attenuated in MCP-I -/- or CCR2 -/- mice backcrossed to APO-E -/-, LDL-R -I- or Apo B transgenic mice maintained on high fat diets (Boring et al. Nature, 394, 894-897 (1998); Gosling et al. J. Clin. Invest.. 103,773-77S (1999)). Thus, CCR2 antagonists may inhibit atherosclerotic lesion formation and pathological progression by impairing monocyte recruitment and differentiation in the arterial wall.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is further directed to compounds which are modulators of chemokine receptor activity and are useful in the prevention or treatment of certain inflammatory and immunoregulatory disorders and diseases, allergic diseases, atopic conditions including allergic rhinitis, dermatitis, conjunctivitis, and asthma, as well as autoimmune pathologies such as rheumatoid aithritis and atherosclerosis. The invention is also directed to pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds and the use of these compounds and compositions in the prevention or treatment of such diseases in which chemokine receptors are involved.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to compounds of tiie formula T.<br><br><br><br>
The compounds of the instant invention have at least two asymmetric centers at the 1- and 3-positions of the cyclopentyl ring, one asymmetric center at the 4-position of the morpholine ring and optionally one asymmetric center at the 3-position of the morpholine ring. Additional asymmetric centers may be present depending upon the nature of the various substituents on the molecule. Each such asymmetric center will independently produce two optical isomers and it is intended that all of the possible optical isomers and diastereomers in mixtures and as pure or<br><br>
partially purified compounds are included within the ambit of this invention. The independent syntheses of diastereomers and enantiomers or their chromatographic separations may be achieved as known in the ait by appropriate modification of the methodology disclosed herein. Their absolute stereochemistn mav be deteraiined by the x-ray crystallography of crystalline products or crystalline inteimediates which are derivatized. if necessary, with a reagent containing an asymmetric center of known absolute configuration.<br>
As appreciated by those of skill in the art, C103alkyl is defined to<br>
identify the group as having I. 2 or 3 carbons in a linear or branched arrangement, such that C1-3aikyl specifically includes methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, and iso-propyl.<br>
The phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable" is employed herein to refer to those compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. As used herein, "pharraaceuticaily acceptable salts" refer to derivatives wherein the parent compound is modified by making acid or base salts thereof. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, mineral or organic acid salts of basic residues such as amines; alkali or organic salts of acidic residues such as carboxylic acids; and the like. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the conventional non-toxic salts or the quaternary ammonium salts of the parent compound formed, for example, from non-toxic inorganic or organic acids. For example, such conventional non-toxic salts include those derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, sulfamic, phosphoric, nitric and the like; and the salts prepared from organic acids such as acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, stearic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, pamoic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, phenylacetic, glutamic, benzoic, salicylic, sulfaniiic, 2-acetoxybenzoic, fumaric, toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, ethane disulfonic, oxalic, isethionic, and the like.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present invention can be prepared from the parent compound which contains a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods. Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting the free acid or base forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base or acid in water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two; generally, nonaqueous media such as ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol, or<br><br>
acetonitrile are preferred. Suitable salts are found, e.g. in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, I7th ed.. Mack Publishing Company, Easton, PA, 1985, p. 1418.<br>
Specific compounds within the present invention include a compound which selected from the group consisting of. the title compounds of the Examples; and phannaceutica]]y acceptable salts thereof and individual diastereomers thereof.<br>
The subject compounds are useful in a method of modulating chemokine receptor activity in a patient in need of such modulation comprising the administration of an effective amount of the compound. The present invention is directed to the use of the foregoing compounds as modulators of chemokine receptor activity. In particular, these compounds are useful as modulators of the chemokine receptors, in particular CCR-2.<br>
The utility of the compounds in accordance with the present invention as modulators of chemokine receptor activity may be demonstrated by methodology known in the art, such as the assay for chemokine binding as disclosed by Van Riper, et al-,J. Exp. Med.. 177. 851-856 (1993) which may be readily adapted for measurement of CCR-2 binding.<br><br><br>
An equal concentration of test compound or DMSO was added to the bottom well to prevent dilution by diffusion. Following a 60 min incubation at 37- C, 5 % CO2, the filter was removed and the topside was washed with HESS containing 0.1 mg/tnl BSA to remove cells that had not migrated into the filter. Spontaneous migration (chemolcinesis) was detemiined in the absence of chemoattractanr<br>
In particular, the compounds of the following examples had activity in binding to the CCR-2 receptor in the aforementioned assays, generally with an IC50<br>
of Jess than about 1 [.iM. Such a result is indicative of the intrinsic activity of the compounds in use as modulators of chemokine receptor activity.<br>
Marmnalian chemolcine receptors provide a taiget for interfering with 01" promoting eosinophil and/or lymphocyte function in a mammal, such as a human. Compounds which inhibit or promote chemokine receptor function, are particularly useful for modulating eosinophil and/or lymphocyte function for therapeutic purposes. Accordingly, compounds which inhibit or promote chemokine receptor function would be useful in treating, preventing, ameliorating, controlling or reducing the risk of a wide VEtriety of inflammatory and immunoregulatory disorders and diseases, aliergic diseases, atopic conditions including allergic rhinitis, dermatitis, conjunctivitis, and asthma, as well as autoimmune pathologies such as rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis. For example, an instant compound which inhibits one or more functions of a mammalian chemokine receptor (e.g., a human chemokine receptor) may be administered to inhibit (i.e., reduce or prevent) inflammation. As a result, one or more inflammatory processes, such as leukocyte emigration, chemotaxis, exocytosis (e.g., of enzymes, histamine) or inflammatory mediator release, is inhibited.<br>
In addition to primates, such as humans, a variety of other mammals can be treated according to the method of the present invention. For instance, mammals including, but not limited to, cows, sheep, goats, horses, dogs, cats, guinea pigs, rats or other bovine, ovine, equine, canine, feline, rodent or murine species can be treated. However, the method can also be practiced in other species, such as avian species (e.g., chickens).<br>
Diseases and conditions associated with inflammation and infection can be treated using the compounds of the present invention. In a preferred embodiment, the disease or condition is one in which the actions of lymphocytes are to be inhibited or promoted, in order to modulate the inflammatory response.<br><br>
Diseases or conditions of humans or other species which can be treated with inhibitors of chenioldne receptor function, include, but are not limited to: inflammatory or allergic diseases and conditions, including respiratory allergic diseases such as asthma, particularly bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis, hypersensitivity lung diseases, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, eosinophilic pneumonias (e.g., Loeffler's syndrome, chronic eosinophilic pneumonia), delayed-type hypersentitivity, interstitial lung diseases (ILD) (e.g., idiopatiaic pulmonary fibrosis, or ILD associated with rheumatoid arthritis, systemic Jupus erythematosus, ankylosing spondylitis, systeniic sclerosis, Sjogren's syndrome, polymyositis or dermatomyositis); systemic anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity responses, drug allergies (e.g., 10 penicillin, cephalosporins), insect sting allergies; autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, myasthenia gravis, juvenile onset diabetes; glomerulonephritis, autoimmune thyroiditis, Behcet's disease; graft rejection (e.g., in transplantation), including allograft rejection or graft-versus-host disease; inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis; spondyloarthropathies; scleroderma; psoriasis (including T-cell mediated psoriasis) and inflammatory deimatoses such an dermatitis, eczema, atopic dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, urticaria; vasculitis (e.g., necrotizing, cutaneous, and hypersensitivity vasculitis); eosinphilic myositis, eosinophilic fasciitis; cancers with leukocyte infiltradon of the<br><br><br>
viscera! larva migraines (e.g., Toxocaia), eosinophilic gastroenteritis (e.g.. Anisald sp., Fhocanema sp.), and cutaneous iarva inigraines (Anoylostona braziliense, Ancylostoma caninum). In addition, treatment of tiie aforementioned inflammator}, allergic and autoimmune diseases can also be contemplated for promoters of chemoldne receptor function if one contemplates the delivery- of sufficient compound to cause the loss of receptor expression on cells through the induction of chemokine receptor mtermalization or delivery of compound in a manner thai results in the misdirection of the migriUion of cells.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are accordingly useful in treating, preventing, ameliorating, controlling or reducing the risk of a wide variety of inflammatory and immunoregulatory disorders and diseases, allergic conditions, atopic conditions, as well as autoimmune pathologies. In a specific embodiment, the present invention is directed to the use of the subject compounds for treating, preventing, ameliorating, controlling or reducing the risk of autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis.<br>
In another aspect, the instant invention may be used to evaluate putative specific agonists or antagonists of chemoidne receptors, including CCR-3. Accordingly, the present invention is directed to the use of these compounds in the preparation and execution of screening assays for compounds which modulate the activity of chemokine receptors. For example, the compounds of this invention are useful for isolating receptor mutants, which are excellent screening tools for more potent compounds. Furthermore, the compounds of this invention are useful in establishing or determining the binding site of other compounds to chemokine receptors, e.g., by competitive inhibition. The compouads of the instant invention are also useful for the evaluation of putative specific modulators of the chemokine receptors, including CCR-2. As appreciated in the ait, thorough evaluation of specific agonists and antagonists of the above chemokine receptors has been hampered by the lack of availability of non-peptidyl (metabolically resistant) compounds with high binding affinity for these receptors. Thus the compounds of this invention are conunercial products to be sold for these purposes.<br>
The present invention is further directed to a method for the manufacture of a medicament for modulating chemokine receptor activity in humans and animals comprising combining a compound of the present invention with a pharmaceutical carrier or diluent.<br><br>
The present invention is further directed to the use of the present compounds in treating, preventing, ameliorating, controiling or reducing the risk of infection by a retrovirus, in particuiar, herpes virus or the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the treatment of, and delaying of the onset of consequent pathological conditions such as AIDS. Treating AIDS or preventing or treating infection by HTV is defined as including, but not limited to, treating a wide range of states of HTV infection: AIDS, ARC (AIDS related complex), both symptomatic and asymptomatic, and actua] or potential exposure to HTV. For example, the compounds of this invention are useful in treating infection by HTV after suspected past exposure to HTV by, e.g., blood transfusion, organ transplant, exchange of body fluids, bites, accidental needle stick, or exposure to patient blood during surgery.<br>
In a preferred aspect of the present invention, a subject compound may be used in a method of inhibiting the binding of a chemokine to a chemokine receptor, such as CCR-2, of a target cell, which comprises contacting the target cell with an amount of the compound which is effective at inhibiting the binding of the chemokine to the chemokine receptor.<br>
The subject treated in the methods above is a mammal, preferably a-human being, male or female, in whom modulation of chemokine receptor activity is desired. "Modulation" as used herein is intended to encompass antagonism, agonism, partial antagonism, inverse agonism and/or partial agonism. In a preferred aspect of the present invention, modulation refers to antagonism of chemokine receptor activity.<br><br><br>
Combined therapy to moduiate chemoldne receptor activity for thereby treating, preventing, ameliorating, controlling or reducing the risi; of inflarmnatory and immoreregulatory disorders and diseases, including asthma and allergic diseases, as well as autoimmune pathologies such as rheumatoid arttiritis and atheroscierosis, and those pathologies noted above is illustrated by the combination of the compounds of this invention and other compounds which are known for such utilities-<br>
