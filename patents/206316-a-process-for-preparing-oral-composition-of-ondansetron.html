Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing a dosage form that can reduce the dosing frequency upto twice or once daily.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing a dosage form comprising of a dosage of Ondansetron or its acid addition salt(s) in a single dosage form so that Ondansetron is released by the dosage form in almost linear fashion and in a pH-independent manner till the duration of therapy after administration of the dosage form to the drug recipient.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a process for preparing dosage form comprising of (a) at least one pharmacologically acceptable water swellable and non-ionic polymer, (b) at least one pharmacologically acceptable organic acid and (c) at least one pharmacologically acceptable water soluble carbohydrate, in an intimate combination<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention provides, in one aspect, a process for preparing a pH-independent and controlled release tablets of Ondansetron or its acid addition salt(s), a weak base exhibiting pH-dependent solubility characteristics, which can reduce the dosing frequency to twice or once daily. Another aspect of the invention is an art of formulating the dosage form by a critical and a unique proportion of non-ionic-water soluble polymer(s), organic acid(s) and water soluble carbohydrate(s) capable of releasing Ondansetron in a pH-independent and a controlled manner for prolonged period of time.<br>
A further aspect of the invention is to control the release of the organic acid from the tablets in such a way, so as to provide a constant acidic microenvironment within the tablet throughout the release of Ondansetron. The invention is pharmaceutical^ useful. The present invention relates to a process for preparing a pharmaceutical composition for the controlled and pH-independent release of Ondansetron which comprises of<br>
(a)	mixing at least one pharmacologically acceptable release rate controlling polymer with pH-independent aqueous swelling ability in a concentration of 20% to 80% w/w with at least one pharmacologically acceptable organic acid or organic acid substance in a concentration of 5% to 60% w/w,<br>
(b)	adding at least one pharmacologically acceptable water-soluble carbohydrate in a concentration of 5% to 60% w/w, such that it is homogeneously distributed,<br>
(c)	mixing Ondansetron or Ondansetron Hydrochloride or Ondansetron Hydrochloride Dihydrate or other acid addition salts thereof at a dose of 2mg to 120mg equivalent to Ondansetron free base to the aforesaid such that it is uniformly distributed.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Applicants have developed a process for preparing Ondansetron or its acid addition salt(s) controlled release dosage form with pH-independent release, which overcomes the natural physicochemical properties of Ondansetron or its acid addition salt(s) of having pH-dependent solubility. This development has been achieved by a novel combination of different principles and skills involved in the pharmaceutical formulations. The following principles were applied.<br>
1.	Ondansetron or it acid addition salt(s) being weakly basic in nature, show good solubility at acidic pH of stomach whereas, its solubility drastically reduces at alkaline pH of the intestinal tract. This difference in its solubility is compensated by providing a constant acidic microenvironment by means of addition of organic acid of sufficient acidic strength to provide constant dissolution of Ondansetron or its acid addition salt(s) within the dosage form and its subsequent release in the intestinal lumen.<br>
2.	The release of Ondansetron or its acid addition salt(s) was controlled by using non-ionic water swellable polymer in the form of matrix tablets. The non-ionic water soluble polymer, swells uniformly in the aqueous environment of gastrointestinal pH and allows for dissolution of organic acid, thus creating an acidic microenvironment necessary for the dissolution of Ondansetron or its acid addition salt(s) at alkaline pH of the intestine.<br>
3.	The hydration of non-ionic water swellable polymer was assisted by incorporation of a water-soluble carbohydrate, which acts as a channeling or pore-forming agent. This agent dissolves in aqueous medium and escape from the matrix of the tablets, thus forming pores or channels or voids within the hydrating polymer matrix,  which<br><br>
