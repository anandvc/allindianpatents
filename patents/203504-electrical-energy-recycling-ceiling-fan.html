ELECTRICAL ENERGY-RECYCLING CEILING FAN<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to fans. More particularly, the invention is an electrical energy-recycling ceiling fan configured to attach to a dynamo attached to the ceiling fan.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Traditional ceiling fans are good at giving flow of moving air. So, traditional ceiling fans are capable of doing only one function, i.e, providing air flow. One prior art ceiling fan can do two functions at a time, such as giving flow of moving air and regenerating electrical energy.<br>
The electrical energy-recycling ceiling fan includes a fan unit with a set of stationary and rotatary members and a dynamo assembly with another set of stationary and rotatary members. The dynamo assembly comprises a stationary winding as armature, which is attached at a point between first end and opposing second end of the elongated rod and a rotatary magnetic wheel, which is mounted on the rotatable disk of the fan unit. As the fan unit rotates, the permanent magnetic poles of the magnetic wheel of the dynamo assembly will rotate in the stationary armature. Thereby an e.m.f is induced by the dynamo and a directed air flow is provided by the fan unit at a time simultaneously. So, the great advantage is to save the energy by recycling during usage of power by the ceiling fan.<br>
The significant disadvantage with traditional ceiling fan is that the recycling of electric energy is impossible.<br>
US application number US 20Q4/036254, applied for by Gonce, Ken, R, describes a suspended ceiling fan that can be moved to a different location in room by means of a ceiling track and can be provided a sustained vectored flow of air that can be aimed at one spot, such as a person's face. One<br><br>
significant disadvantage of the suspended ceiling fan is that the recycling of electrical energy is impossible.<br>
US  application number 2003/0082062, published Mayl, 2003  and<br>
applied for by Chen, describes a multi-rotor ceiling fan comprising a ceiling<br>
fan body and a rack body. The ceiling fan body includes rotatable disk<br>
suspended from a support rod. The rack includes a pair of rods extending from<br>
opposite sides of the disk. Each pair of rods supporting a fan. The fans are<br>
positioned so that the air flow generated by the fans causes the disk to rotate.<br>
The fans are not recycling the mechanical energy on the disk to produce the<br>
electrical energy.<br>
US patent number 6,364,638 issued April 2, 2002 to Liu. The ceiling fan provides flow of air only, but cannot provide the recycling of mechanical energy on the rotatable disk to produce the electrical energy.<br>
US patent Number 5,222,864, issued June 29, 1993 to Pearce, describes a ceiling fan that comprises an electrical motor with separate stationary and rotatary members to direct airflow. The Pearce 5,222,864 device is unable to provide the recycling of mechanical energy on the rotatable disk to produce electrical energy.<br>
None of the above inventions and patents, either singly or in combination, is seen to describe the instant invention as claimed. Thus energy-recycling ceiling fan providing the recycling of mechanical energy to produce electrical energy is achieved.<br><br>
OBJECTIVES :<br>
1.	An objective of the invention is to overcome problems associated with the traditional ceiling fans.<br>
2.	An objective of the invention is to provide a ceiling fan having one or more electrical devices i.e, a device that is electrically powered, whether by direct current or altemating current, and a device that generates electric power.<br>
3.	Another objective is to provide a motor for some applications.<br>
4.	Another objective is to provide a dynamo unit having a stationary armature and a magnetic wheel with permanent magnetic poles.<br>
5.	Another objective is to provide a magnetic wheel with permanent magnetic poles being attached to the rotatable disk of the ceiling fan.<br>
6.	Another objective is to provide speed synchronization between the rotatable disk of the ceiling fan and the magnetic wheel of the dynamo unit.<br>
7.	Another objective is to distribute the fan blades and the magnatic wheel with permanent magnetic poles on the rotatable disk of the ceiling fan.<br>
8.	Another objective of the invention is to provide circulation of air at one or more points in three-dimensional space. A further objective is to generate e.m.f., during the circulation of air while the rotatable disk is rotating after the fan being powered.<br>
9.	Another objective is to provide one or more networks, i.e a JENFAN (Jaya's ENergy Feast Achievable Network), to store and save the generated e.m.f by the invention.<br>
lO.Other objectives and advantages of the invention will be apparent to those of skill in the art.<br><br>
