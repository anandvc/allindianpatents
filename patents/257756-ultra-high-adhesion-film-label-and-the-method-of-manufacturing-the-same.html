COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10)<br>
ULTRA HIGH ADHESION FILM LABEL AND THE METHOD OF MANUFACTURING THE SAME.<br><br><br>
PRS Solutions Private Limited, a Company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956 and having its office at 63, Bombay Samachar Marg, Mumbai - 400 001 Maharashtra State, India, India.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates to Ultra high adhesion film label  and the process of manufacturing the same. The label is a pressure sensitive adhesive label and it comprises of three or more layers -film, printing layer &amp; double sided adhesive tape. The adhesive surface is protected with a silicone resin coated paper or film.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART:<br>
Machine, equipment and instrument manufacturers require several labels to be affixed on the body of their products such as machines and equipments. These labels are generally used for the purpose of part or component identification, brand identification, manufacturer's details, rating plates, warning / caution labels, circuit diagrams and/ or operating instructions to help the user understand the machine / equipment better and use it correctly. The primary requirement for such labels is that the message and/or diagrams on the label should remain clearly legible throughout the life of the machine / equipment in spite of the fact that during the operation / use, the machine as well as the labels have to withstand the harsh conditions of temperature, oil, grease, dirt etc. Mostly such labels are made by engraving and/or printing on metal plates which are fixed to the body of the machine/equipment by riveting. Although labels made out of such metal plates are strong and sturdy to withstand the harsh conditions of temperature and impact, they have many disadvantages as well. Accumulation of dust and oil strains make the message/markings illegible after prolonged use. Holes drilled<br>
2<br><br>
on the body of the machine / equipments for riveting such metal plates leads to rusting of the machine/ equipment. Due to constant vibrations during the operation of the machine the rivets tend to become loose resulting into rattling of the metal plates and starts making noise. The metal plates are also very difficult to maintain in clean conditions.<br>
One of the answers to such problems is use of pressure sensitive labels that can adhere strongly on the body of the machine, equipment etc and can remain adhered during the life of such machine, equipment etc. The pressure sensitive labels are generally manufactured and used as a two component laminate. The pressure sensitive adhesives are coated on one side of the backing materials and the adhesive coated side is covered with a release liner. The message is then printed on the non adhesive side of the adhesive coated materials. Such labels being printed on the top surface tend to fade out and/or get washed out due to frequent wiping and cleaning using chemicals such as diesel, petrol, kerosene etc. This makes the purpose of using the label ineffective.<br>
In the present invention an attempt has been made to develop a transparent film based label using a pressure sensitive adhesive having very high adhesion to common application surfaces like metal, plastics etc.<br>
The label manufactured by this invention is very elegant and it can be used in areas where earlier metal plates were riveted using screws and had the problem of rattling. The label manufactured<br>
3<br><br>
by this invention has very high adhesion and it can replace metal plates and it is very difficult to remove from the adhered surface.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
"Ultra high adhesion film label is a pressure sensitive self adhesive label in which a clear, transparent / translucent polymeric film is printed on one of the surfaces with the desired message / diagram etc. and the said printed surface is laminated with one or more layers of pressure sensitive adhesive having very high peel strength, very high initial tack and very high holding power. for ease of application and to protect the adhesive layer from contamination a silicone resin coated paper or film liner is<br>
used.<br>
The process for manufacturing Ultra high adhesion film label" comprised of:<br>
(a)	printing one or more layers of inks as per requirement by a known printing technique, preferably by screen printing technique, on one of the surfaces of a transparent and clear / translucent polymeric film of desired dimensions;<br>
(b)	manufacturing of double sided tape by coating high adhesion pressure sensitive acrylic adhesive on one side of silicone resin coated paper or film release liner which has differential release property followed by lamination on a polyester film which is then coated on the other side with high adhesion pressure sensitive acrylic adhesive;<br>
4<br><br>
(c)	lamination of the exposed adhesive layer of the double sided tape obtained in 1(b) with the printed surface of the polymeric film prepared in 1(a);<br>
(d)	punching of the laminated film so obtained with pre¬determined design, to get the final labels.<br>
The labels obtained by the above process:-<br>
1.	has a very strong adhesion and high tack for easy sticking on any metal surface,<br>
2.	has an excellent clarity of image, adding to the image of the product,<br>
3.	is thinner than conventional metal plates,<br>
4.	is very easy to apply and does not require any additional tools and/or skill,<br>
5.	has excellent resistance to scratch and abrasion,<br>
6.	is resistant to oil, grease, soap solutions, mild acids and alkalies, diesel and petrol,<br>
7.	can withstand weather conditions, be it outdoors or harsh industrial environment,<br>
8.	is easy to maintain and clean, and<br>
9.	is resistant to temperatures up to 100° C.<br>
The clear transparent / translucent film used for manufacturing ultra high adhesion labels is made up of a polymeric substrate such as Polyester, Polycarbonate etc. capable of withstanding high temperature and high impact. In one of the preferred embodiment (figure 1) the said film is a both side smooth transparent and clear polycarbonate film having thickness of 0.05<br>
5<br><br>
mm to 0.5 mm preferably 0.10 to 0.30 mm. Polycarbonate film offers much desired properties of high temperature resistance and high impact strength to the label.<br>
The required message is printed on one of the surfaces of the said film by screen printing technique using inks that are temperature dried or are curable under ultraviolet radiation. For multicolour printed labels one colour is printed at a time and is followed by air drying, drying in an air circulating oven at temperatures not exceeding 60°C or cured under a medium pressure mercury vapor lamp. Subsequent colours are printed thereafter in similar way one after the other till all colours as per design are printed. The last layer {i.e background layer) of printing comprises of an opaque white layer covering the entire surface of the label.<br>
The double sided tape is 0.008 to 0.012 mm thick polyester film coated on both surfaces with ultra high adhesion acrylic adhesive and protected with silicone resin coated paper or film liner.<br>
The manufacturing of double sided tape consists of coating a very high adhesion pressure sensitive acrylic adhesive on the easy release side of a differential release paper or film liner. The said paper or film has silicone resin coating on both sides and the silicone resin contents on both sides are different so as to have sufficient differential release in order to retain the adhesive on the side to which it was originally coated. The said coated paper or film is then dried and laminated to a polyester film to obtain one side adhesive coated polyester film. Another layer of a ultra high adhesion pressure sensitive acrylic adhesive is coated on the non<br>
6<br><br>
adhesive side of one side adhesive coated polyester film by conventional coating equipment followed by drying in conventional driers to get the double sided tape. The said tape is then slit in desired length and width.<br>
The ultra high adhesion pressure sensitive adhesive used in this invention is manufactured by co polymerising combinations of monomers like vinyl acetate, 2- ethyl hexyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, acrylic acid in a solvent like ethyl acetate, toluene etc. using peroxide catalyst like benzoyl peroxide in a vessel which is maintained around 80°C to get the acrylic adhesive which is then modified if required by addition of tackifying resins to get very high adhesion pressure sensitive adhesive.<br>
The monomer composition in the very high adhesion pressure sensitive adhesive may comprise of additional monomers like GMA (Glycedyl methacrylate) methyl acrylate and others if required.<br>
The adhesive of the present invention contains one or more of tackifiers which can be formed of rosin derivatives, polyterpenes, terpene phenols any compatible conventional tackifier or mixtures thereof. It has been found that a mixture of resins can provide a better balance of properties than use of any one resin alone.<br>
The adhesive of this invention contains peroxide catalyst which can be formed of benzoyl peroxide, azo bis isobutyro nitrile &amp; and mixtures thereof in order to get the adhesive with the desired viscosity.<br>
7<br><br>
The release liner used in this invention is a both side release coated paper or film which has different types and concentrations of silicone resin on either side to give much desired differential release properties on both sides. The release level, however, is sufficiently low to allow a good transfer of acrylic adhesive from the surface of the release liner to the polyester film used. The silicone resin used for coating paper or film liners in this invention is based on solvent less platinum cured silicone resin, solvated platinum cured silicone resin, solvated tin cured silicone resin, Fluorosilicone and/or similar materials having property of releasing adhesive from the surface.<br>
