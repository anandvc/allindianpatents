				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a heterophasic alpha-olefin random copolymer composi-<br>
tion having a low stiffness and an improved thermal behaviour. Moreover, the<br>
present invention is related to the process for the manufacture of the new poly-<br>
mer composition as well as its use.<br>
Background art<br>
Polymers are increasingly used in different demanding applications. At the same<br>
time there is a continuous seek for tailored polymers which meet the require-<br>
ments of these applications. The demands can be challenging, since many poly-<br>
mer properties are directly or indirectly interrelated. For instance, it has been<br>
problematic to develop polymers with the combination of low stiffness together<br>
with high melting temperature. E.g. EP 991 719 of the Applicant discloses pro-<br>
pylene polymers having tensile modulus of 420 MPa or less. However, there is<br>
still need to control or to improve the thermal behaviour of the polymer together<br>
with the low stiffness.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
Hence, the object of the present invention is to provide further heterophasic al-<br>
pha-olefin random copolymer compositions which broaden the product window<br>
of polymers for wide variety of end applications.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for obtaining fur-<br>
ther alternatives for the polymer compositions.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that a heterophasic alpha-olefin random copolymer<br>
composition having a high melting temperature (Tm) and at the same time a low<br>
flexural modulus, i.e. low stiffness, can be obtained with a copolymer composi-<br>
tion as tailored according to the invention.<br>
Accordingly, the heterophasic alpha-olefin random copolymer composition of the<br>
invention comprises<br>
- an alpha-olefin random copolymer component (A) of at least two alpha-olefin<br>
(co)polymer fractions (i) and (ii), and<br>
- a rubber component (B), whereby the comonomer content between the alpha-<br>
olefin polymer fractions (i) and (ii) is different and whereby at least one of frac-<br>
tions (i) and (ii) is a random copolymer. The other of said two fractions (i) and<br>
(ii) can be a homopolymer or a copolymer. This tailored combination of compo-<br>
nents (A) and (B) provides a heterophasic alpha-olefin random copolymer com-<br>
position having a melting temperature (Tm) of at least 130°C and a flexural<br>
modulus of not higher than 1000 MPa.<br>
Unexpectedly, it has been found that the melting temperature can be controlled<br>
with the different comonomer content between fractions (i) and (ii), so that said<br>
combination of high melting temperature (Tm) and, at the same time, low flexural<br>
modulus, i.e. low stiffness, can be achieved. Also unexpectedly, rubber compo-<br>
nent (B) can be incorporated to the random copolymer component (A) of the in-<br>
vention and still the improved thermal behaviour together with the low stiffness<br>
of the final composition can be maintained.<br>
The present invention thus provides feasible means to control and adjust the<br>
combination of low stiffness (modulus) and thermal behaviour.<br>
Preferably, with the present invention it is also possible to obtain heterophasic<br>
alpha-olefin copolymers i.a. with good impact strength at low temperatures and,<br>
optionally, advantageous optical or sealing properties or both, depending on the<br>
needs of the end use application.<br>
The "heterophasic alpha-olefin random copolymer composition" is referred<br>
herein below also shortly as "random-heterophasic copolymer".<br>
By the term "random copolymer" is meant herein that the comonomer in said co-<br>
polymer is distributed randomly, i.e. by statistical insertion of the comonomer<br>
units, within the copolymer chain. Said term "random" copolymer is generally<br>
known and used in the art.<br>
The "random copolymer component (A)" forms "matrix (A)" of the random-<br>
heterophasic copolymer. Both terms are used herein below.<br>
The term "rubber, component" is well known in the field and means herein an<br>
elastomeric alpha-olefin copolymer component (B) of the random-heterophasic<br>
copolymer produced separately and dispersed in matrix (A). Preferably, said rub-<br>
ber component (B) is produced separately in a multistage process in the presence<br>
of matrix (A) as described herein below. Typically rubber component (B) is thus<br>
a copolymer of at least two alpha-olefms and is mainly in amorphous (= xylene<br>
soluble, XS) form. Rubber component (B) is suitably an elastomeric propylene<br>
copolymer with one or more alpha-olefin comonomers, preferably at least with<br>
ethylene and optionally with one or more higher alpha-olefms.<br>
As known, also matrix (A) comprises an amorphous (= xylene soluble, XS) part.<br>
The amount of said amorphous part of matrix (A) can be increased by increasing<br>
the comonomer content of matrix (A). Accordingly, the amorphous part of matrix<br>
(A) and the amorphous rubber component (B) are dispersed as an "amorphous<br>
phase" in matrix (A).<br>
Brief Description Of The Accompanying Drawings<br>
Figure 1 is a plot showing ethylene content in matrix (A) versus melting point for<br>
polymers of examples 1, 2, 5 and 8 of the invention; and<br>
Figure 2 shows a plot of stiffness versus xylene solubles in matrix composition of<br>
the polymers of examples 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10 and 14 of the present invention.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
Preferably, the present invention provides a heterophasic alpha-olefin random<br>
copolymer composition comprising<br>
(a) an alpha-olefin random copolymer component (A) which comprises at least<br>
one fraction (i) comprising a homopolymer of an alpha-olefin or a co-<br>
polymer of an alpha-olefin with one or more alpha-olefin comonomers,<br>
and at least one fraction (ii) comprising a copolymer of an alpha-olefin<br>
with one or more alpha-olefin comonomers, and<br>
(b) a rubber component (B) dispersed in the random copolymer component (A),<br>
whereby<br>
-the amount (wt%) of comonomer in fraction (ii) is higher than the amount<br>
(wt%) of comonomer in fraction (i), and wherein<br>
-the heterophasic alpha-olefin random copolymer composition has a melting<br>
temperature (Tm) of at least 130°C and a flexural modulus of not higher<br>
than 1000 MPa.<br>
Accordingly, fraction (i) can either comprise a homopolymer or a random co-<br>
polymer as defined above, or a mixture of a homo and/or (co)polymer(s), pro-<br>
vided that, if there is any comonomer present in fraction (i), the amount (wt%) of<br>
the comonomer in fraction (i) is lower than the amount (wt%) of the comonomer<br>
in fraction (ii), and thus also lower than the total amount (wt%), i.e. the total co-<br>
monomer content (wt%), of matrix (A).<br>
It has been surprisingly found that the melting temperature (Tm) of the random-<br>
heterophasic copolymer is controlled and determined with fraction (i) of matrix<br>
(A): It is believed that fraction (i) of the homo or random copolymer with a lower<br>
comonomer content determines or contributes to the final melting temperature of<br>
the random-heterophasic copolymer composition, even though the second random<br>
copolymer fraction (ii), and as a result matrix (A) of fractions (i) and (ii), has<br>
higher comonomer content than fraction (i). The low flexural modulus, i.e. de-<br>
creased stiffness, is in turn due to the total comonomer content of matrix (A),<br>
which decreased stiffness can be advantageously tailored further with rubber<br>
component (B).<br>
Furthermore, within the present concept it is possible to vary one or both of the<br>
properties of said combination, ie. either to decrease the stiffness further or to<br>
increase the Tm further, or both to decrease the stiffness and increase the Tm fur-<br>
ther, depending on the desired end application.<br>
It is understood herein that the values of Tm of more than 130°C and flexural<br>
modulus of less than 1000 MPa of the random-heterophasic copolymer of the<br>
invention can be obtained and controlled at least with the comonomer contents of<br>
fractions (i) and (ii) preferably in the presence of rubber component (B) as de-<br>
fined above.<br>
Therefore, as a further aspect the invention provides also a use of a random co-<br>
polymer component (A), which comprises at least two alpha-olefin (co)polymer<br>
fractions (i) and (ii), wherein at least one of fractions (i) and (ii) is an alpha-<br>
olefin copolymer and wherein fractions (i) and (ii) have different comonomer<br>
contents (wt%), for controlling and adjusting, i.e. tailoring, the combination of<br>
thermal behaviour and stiffness of the random copolymer component (A) by<br>
means of a different comonomer content between the two fractions (i) and (ii).<br>
Preferably, fraction (ii) has higher comonomer content than fraction (i) as de-<br>
fined above. In one preferable embodiment of said use the comonomer difference<br>
between said fractions (i) and (ii) is chosen to obtain a flexural modulus less than<br>
1000 MPa and Tm of more than 130°C of the random copolymer component (A).<br>
In another embodiment of said use a rubber component (B) is incorporated into<br>
said matrix (A) and, optionally, the stiffness is further controlled by said rubber<br>
component (B). More preferably, the random-heterophasic copolymer of the in-<br>
vention as defined above or below is used for the tailoring of said property com-<br>
bination.<br>
If desired, Tm and stiffness may be tailored further within the limits of the inven-<br>
tion by means of other features, e.g. by adding further polymer compounds or<br>
additives in a manner known in the field.<br>
Furthermore, the heterophasic-random copolymer composition of the invention<br>
may preferably also exhibit a good impact strength at low temperatures. More-<br>
over, rubber component (B) provides highly feasible means for further tailoring,<br>
e.g. further increasing, the impact strength at low temperatures, if desired.<br>
In addition to said impact strength at low temperatures, the invention enables a<br>
wide flexibility in other properties of the random-heterophasic copolymer to meet<br>
the demands in various end applications. As an example e.g. optical properties<br>
and sealing properties or both can be varied within the invention. The tailoring<br>
can be effected e.g. by adjusting the crystalline and amorphous part of the ran-<br>
dom-heterophasic copolymer in a known manner to optimize the desired optical<br>
properties. As an example of the means for tailoring the copolymer composition<br>
include one or more of the following: the type and the number of the comono-<br>
mer(s) used in matrix (A) and in rubber component (B); the total amount of the<br>
comonomer in matrix (A); the amount of the comonomer in each of fractions (i)<br>
and (ii) within the limits of the invention; the amount of the comonomer in rub-<br>
ber component (B); the weight ratio between matrix (A) and rubber component<br>
(B); as well as the weight ratio, i.e. split, between fractions (i) and (ii).<br>
Accordingly, matrix (A) of the random-heterophasic copolymer is multimodal<br>
with respect to the comonomer distribution due to the difference in the comono-<br>
mer contents between fractions (i) and (ii). The "multimodal comonomer distri-<br>
bution" is further defined in the under "definitions and determination methods"<br>
below.<br>
The following definitions and specific ranges represent either individually or in<br>
any combinations some of the feasible or preferable general subgroups or em-<br>
bodiments of the random-heterophasic polymer of the invention:<br>
Matrix (A) can be unimodal or multimodal with respect to the molecular weight<br>
distribution (MWD). The "multimodal MWD" is further defined under the ex-<br>
perimental part below and includes the bimodal matrix (A). The two fractions (i)<br>
and (ii) provide also a feasible means to obtain said "multimodal, e.g. bimodal,<br>
MWD". Furthermore, the MWD can be narrow or broad in a manner well known<br>
in the art.<br>
In one embodiment, fraction (i) of matrix (A) comprises a homopolymer compo-<br>
nent, and preferably is comprised of a homopolymer component of one alpha-<br>
olefin. This embodiment is referred herein also as H/R-matrix (A). Preferably, in<br>
H/R-matrix (A) fraction (i) is a homopolymer propylene, and fraction (ii) is a<br>
random copolymer of propylene with one or more alpha-olefins.<br>
In a second embodiment fraction (i) of matrix (A) comprises a random copoly-<br>
mers) of an alpha-olefin(s) with at least one alpha-olefin comonomer, and pref-<br>
erably is comprised of a copolymer of one alpha-olefin with at least one alpha-<br>
olefin comonomer. This embodiment is referred herein also as R/R-matrix (A).<br>
Preferably, in R/R-matrix (A) fraction (i) is a random copolymer of propylene<br>
with one or more alpha-olefins and fraction (ii) is a copolymer of propylene with<br>
one or more alpha-olefins.<br>
Similarly, fraction (ii) of matrix (A) comprises a random copolymer(s) of an al-<br>
pha-olefin(s) with at least one alpha-olefin comonomer, and preferably is com-<br>
prised of a copolymer of one alpha-olefin with at least one alpha-olefin comono-<br>
mer, such as a copolymer of propylene with one or more alpha-olefins.<br>
Preferably, matrix (A) is comprised of fractions (i) and (ii) and, optionally, of a<br>
prepolymer fraction in a conventional manner. Alternatively, as indicated above,<br>
fractions (i) and (ii) may comprise further (co)polymer components or matrix (A)<br>
may comprise further fractions within the limits of the invention.<br>
The melting temperature (Tm) of the heterophasic polymer composition is at least<br>
130°C, preferably at least 131°C, more preferably at least 133°C. On the other<br>
hand, the melting temperature is typically not higher than 170°C. The present Tm<br>
describes the improved thermal behaviour.<br>
Preferably, also fraction (i) of matrix (A) has a melting temperature of at least<br>
130°C, preferably of at least 131°C, e.g. of at least 133°C. Furthermore, fraction<br>
(i) of matrix (A) has suitably a melting temperature of not higher than 170°C. In<br>
practice, the melting temperature of fraction (i) of matrix (A) is essentially in the<br>
same level as the melting temperature of the random-heterophasic copolymer,<br>
and if Tm of fraction (i) is higher, then it is typically not higher than up to 15°C<br>
of the Tm of the final random-heterophasic copolymer, the Tm of fraction (i) be-<br>
ing e.g. between 0 to 12°C, suitably between 1 to 8°C, higher.<br>
Typically, fraction (i) of matrix (A) has thus a higher melting temperature than fraction<br>
(ii) of matrix (A) and fraction (i) contributes to the Tm of matrix (A) and to the Tm of<br>
the final random-heterophasic copolymer as well.<br>
In one embodiment (i), the melting temperature (Tm) of the random-heterophasic<br>
copolymer is of at least 130°C, preferably of at least 132°C. Preferably, the melt-<br>
ing temperature (Tm) of said random-heterophasic copolymer may then not be<br>
higher than 165°C, suitably not higher than 155°C. In this embodiment said Tm<br>
may e.g. range between 130 to 165°C, preferably it ranges from 132 to 155°C. In<br>
this embodiment (i) matrix is preferably a R/R-matrix (A).<br>
In another embodiment (ii), the melting temperature (Tm) of the random-<br>
heterophasic copolymer is of at least 130°C, preferably of at least 135°C. Said<br>
melting temperature (Tm) may not be higher than 170°C. Preferably, said melting<br>
temperature (Tm) ranges from 135 to 160°C. Preferably, also in this embodiment<br>
(ii) matrix is a R/R-matrix (A).<br>
In still another preferred embodiment (iii), the melting temperature (Tm) of the<br>
random-heterophasic copolymer may be of at least 130°C, preferably of at least<br>
135°C, suitably of at least 140°C and in some cases even of at least 145°C may<br>
be desired. In this embodiment said Tm is preferably not higher than 170°C, such<br>
as not higher than 165°C. The melting temperature (Tm) of the random-<br>
heterophasic copolymer may thus range e.g. from 145 to 165°C. Preferably, in<br>
this embodiment (iii) matrix is a H/R-matrix (A).<br>
The flexural modulus describes the stiffness (softeness) of the random-<br>
heterophasic copolymer. The flexural modulus of the random-heterophasic co-<br>
polymer is thus not higher than 1000 MPa, typically not higher than 990 MPa,<br>
preferably not higher than 900 MPa, suitably not higher than 800 MPa.<br>
The lower limit is not critical, however it may be preferable that the flexural<br>
modulus is not lower than 100 MPa. Accordingly, the flexural modulus of the<br>
random-heterophasic copolymer preferably ranges from 100 to 1000, e.g. to 990<br>
or to 800 MPa.<br>
In one embodiment (iv) a considerably low stiffness may be desired, whereby the<br>
flexural modulus of the random-heterophasic copolymer is not higher than 600<br>
MPa, preferably not higher than 500 MPa, suitably not higher than 450 MPa, and<br>
even may not be higher than 400 MPa. In this embodiment (iv), the heterophasic<br>
polymer composition may have a flexural modulus e.g. in the range of 100 to 600<br>
MPa, suitably of 100 to 500 MPa, preferably of 100 to 450 MPa, and may even<br>
be of 150 to 400 MPa. This embodiment (iv) may preferably be combined with<br>
the embodiment (i) above, so that the flexural modulus is as given in this para-<br>
graph, and the melting temperature of the random-heterophasic copolymer is at<br>
least 130°C, suitably of at least 132°C, and preferably not higher than 165°C, e.g.<br>
not higher than 155°C. For instance, matrix (A) is a R/R matrix (A) and the ran-<br>
dom-heterophasic copolymer thereof has a Tm in a range of 130 to 165°C, pref-<br>
erably in the range of 132 to 155°C.<br>
In another embodiment (v), the flexural modulus and the melting temperature of<br>
the random-heterophasic copolymer may be: the flexural modulus is not higher<br>
than 600 MPa, preferably not higher than 500 MPa, suitably not higher than 450<br>
MPa, and even may not be higher than 400 MPa. Typically, the flexural modulus<br>
may range from 100 to 600 MPa, such as from 100 to 500 MPa, preferably from<br>
100 to 450 MPa, e.g. from 150 to 400 MPa. This embodiment (v) may preferably<br>
be combined with the embodiment (ii) above, so that the flexural modulus is as<br>
given in this paragraph, and the melting temperature of the random-heterophasic<br>
copolymer is at least 130°C, preferably at least 135°C. Suitably, the melting tem-<br>
perature (Tm) shall not be higher than 170°C, preferably not higher than 160°C.<br>
Tm may range e.g. between 135 to 160°C. This embodiment is particularly suit-<br>
able for an R/R-matrix (A).<br>
In further embodiment (vi), the flexural modulus of the random-heterophasic co-<br>
polymer is lower than 350 MPa and preferably the melting temperature (Tm) of at<br>
least 130°C, suitably of at least 132°C. The melting temperature (Tm) of this em-<br>
bodiment may not be higher than 165°C, preferably not higher than 155°C. For<br>
instance, matrix (A) is typically an R/R-matrix (A) and the melting temperature<br>
for this embodiment ranges from 130 to 165°C, preferably from 132 to 155°C.<br>
In yet another embodiment (vii), the flexural modulus of the random-<br>
heterophasic copolymer is lower than 1000 MPa, typically may range between<br>
300 to 990 MPa, preferably between 300 to 900 MPa, suitably between 400 to<br>
800 MPa. In this embodiment (vii) the melting temperature (Tm) of the random-<br>
heterophasic copolymer varies typically in the range of 130 to 170°C, preferably<br>
in the range of 140 to 170°C, such as in the range of 140 to 160°C. Preferably,<br>
matrix (A) is a H/R-matrix (A).<br>
In still another embodiment (viii), the flexural modulus of the random-<br>
heterophasic copolymer is not higher than 1000 MPa, and is typically in the<br>
range of 300 to 990 MPa, preferably in the range of 300 to 900 MPa, such as in<br>
the range of 400 to 900 MPa, and may even be in the range of 400 to 800 MPa. In<br>
this embodiment (viii) the melting temperature of the random-heterophasic co-<br>
polymer is at least 130°C, preferably of at least 135°C, suitaly of at least 140CC,<br>
such as at least 145°C. The melting temperature (Tm) in this embodiment (viii) is<br>
typically not higher than 170°C, preferably not higher than 165°C, an may be<br>
e.g. in a range of 145 to 165°C. Preferably, matrix (A) is a H/R-matrix (A).<br>
As defined above, the comonomer contents are different in fraction (i) and (ii) of<br>
matrix (A). Said difference is defined herein as the difference between the<br>
amount (wt%) of comonomer in fraction (i) and the total amount (wt%) of the<br>
comonomer in matrix (A), whereby said comonomer content (wt%) of fraction (i)<br>
is lower than that of matrix (A). The "difference in comonomer content between<br>
fraction (i) and matrix (A)" (in wt%) is thus calculated by subtracting the "co-<br>
monomer content of fraction (i)" (in wt%) from the "total comonomer content of<br>
matrix (A)" (in wt%), i.e.:<br>
"difference in comonomer content between fraction (i) and matrix (A)" = "total<br>
comonomer content of matrix (A)" - "comonomer content of fraction (i)".<br>
E.g. in case of a multistage polymerisation process of the random-heterophasic<br>
copolymer as further described below, the comonomer content of fraction (i) or<br>
(ii), which is prepared first, preferably fraction (i), and matrix (A) can be deter-<br>
mined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) in a known manner,<br>
and the secondly prepared fraction (i) or (ii), preferably fraction (ii), can be cal-<br>
culated from the measured values of the firstly prepared fraction and matrix (A)<br>
taking account the weight ratios, i.e. split, of fractions (i) and (ii). Similarly the<br>
comonomer content of rubber (B) can be calculated from the measured (by FTIR)<br>
comonomer content of matrix (A) and the final random-heterophasic copolymer<br>
taking account the weight ratios of matrix (A) and rubber (B).<br>
Typically, the difference in the comonomer content between fraction (i) and ma-<br>
trix (A) is at least 0.5 wt%, preferably at least 1 wt%. The difference in said co-<br>
monomer content is e.g. up to 15 wt%, suitably up to 10 wt%, such as 8 wt%, for<br>
example up to 6 wt%.<br>
In one embodiment (I), preferably in case of R/R-matrix (A) said difference in<br>
the comonomer content between matrix (A) and random copolymer fraction (i) is<br>
0.5, e.g. at least 1 wt%, preferably at least 2 wt% or higher, e.g. may be up to 6<br>
wt%, e.g. up to 4 wt%.<br>
In another embodiment (II), preferably in case of H/R-matrix, higher difference<br>
may be desired, whereby the difference in said comonomer content between ma-<br>
trix (A) and the homopolymer fraction (i) may vary in broader range, being e.g.<br>
at least 2 wt%, typically at least 3 wt%, preferably at least 4 wt %, even at least 5<br>
wt%. The upper limit in said difference may be up to 10 wt%, for example up to<br>
8 wt%, in some embodiments e.g. in the range of 3 to 6 wt%.<br>
Furthermore, the comonomer content in matrix (A), i.e. the total amount of the<br>
comonomer in matrix (A), is typically at least 1 wt%, and may be e.g. up to 13<br>
wt%, suitably between 2 to 12 wt%, e.g. between 3 to 12 wt% or even between 5<br>
to 12 wt%.<br>
In one embodiment (ix) said total comonomer content in matrix (A) is up to 13<br>
wt%, e.g. in a range of 4 to 12 wt%, preferably in a range of 6 to 12 wt%, more<br>
preferably in a range of 7 to 10 wt%.<br>
In another embodiment (x), the total comonomer content in matrix (A) may be up<br>
to 12 wt%, preferably shall range from between 1 to 12 wt% and suitably in the<br>
range of 2 to 10 wt%.<br>
Furthermore, the homo- or random copolymer of fraction (i) can have a comono-<br>
mer content of up to 15 wt%, suitably of up to 10 wt%, depending i.a. on the type<br>
of matrix (A) (H/R- or R/R-) and on the Tm and stiffness levels desired. Thus in<br>
one embodiment (xi) the amount of comonomer in fraction (i) may varied e.g.<br>
within any of the ranges: 0 to 1, 0 to 2, 0 to 3, 0 to 4, 0 to 5, 0 to 6, 0 to 7, 0 to 8,<br>
0 to 9 or even up to 10 wt%, such as 0 to 6 wt %.<br>
It may be preferable for some end applications, that the comonomer content of<br>
fraction (i) in R/R-matrix (A) may vary between 1.5 to 6 wt%, such as 1.5 to 4<br>
wt%. Alternatively, for some other end applications comonomer content of frac-<br>
tion (i) of 4 to 6 wt% may be desired.<br>
One feasible range of the amount of comonomer in fraction (i) for adjusting the<br>
Tm within the limits of the invention may vary from 0 to 10 wt%, preferably from<br>
0 to 6 wt%, but is not limited thereto.<br>
It is in turn, preferable that the copolymer of fraction (ii) has a comonomer con-<br>
tent of up to 20 wt%.<br>
In one embodiment (xii) the amount of the comonomer in fraction (ii) is not<br>
lower than 2 wt%, more preferably not lower than 3 wt%, e.g. between 3 to 15<br>
wt%, for some end applications even below 10 wt% may be desirable.<br>
In another embodiment (xiii) the copolymer of fraction (ii) has a comonomer<br>
content in the range of 2 to 20 wt%, preferably in the range of 5 to 20 wt%, e.g.<br>
in the range of 6 to 17 wt%.<br>
In a further embodiment (xiv) the amount of the comonomer in fraction (ii) is<br>
not lower than 10 wt% and preferably in the range of 10 to 15 wt%.<br>
Also the amount of the comonomer in rubber component (B) and the amount of<br>
rubber (B) in the random-heterophasic copolymer can be varied within the limits<br>
of the invention to adjust i.a. one or more of the stiffness, impact strength at low<br>
temperatures and optical properties of the final random-heterophasic copolymer<br>
to the level desirable of the end application in question.<br>
Typically, the comonomer content of rubber component (B) is in the range of 10<br>
to 60 wt%, more preferably in the range of 15 to 50 wt%.<br>
In one embodiment (xv), the amount of comonomer in rubber component (B) is<br>
in a range of 15 to 40 wt%.<br>
In another embodiment (xvi), rubber component (B) has a comonomer content in<br>
the range of 20 to 40, preferably in the range of 20 to 35 wt%.<br>

alpha-olefin, C6 alpha-olefin, C7 alpha-olefin, C8 alpha-olefin, C9 alpha-olefin,<br>
C10 alpha-olefin, Cn alpha-olefin, C12 alpha-olefin. Preferably, the comonomers<br>
are selected from the group consisting of ethylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 4-<br>
methyl-1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-heptene or 1-octene. The preferred comonomer is<br>
ethylene.<br>
Preferably, rubber component (B) is a propylene copolymer, more preferably a co-<br>

Accordingly, as a further embodiment (1) the invention provides a random-<br>
heterophasic propylene copolymer comprises<br>

whereby<br>
- the amount of comonomer in fraction (ii) is higher than the amount of co-<br>
monomer in fraction (i), and wherein<br>
- the random-heterophasic copolymer has a melting temperature (Tm) of at<br>
least 130°C and a flexural modulus of not higher than 1000 MPa.<br>
The above defined options and subgroups for 'the comonomer content in fraction<br>
(i), fraction (ii) and matrix (A) apply particularly suitably for the polypropylene<br>
random copolymer component (1).<br>
The split, i.e. the weight ratio, between fraction (i) and (ii) in matrix (A) is pref-<br>
erably 30:70 to 70:30, more preferably between 40:60 to 60:40.<br>
Moreover, the amount of matrix (A) in the random-heterophasic copolymer may<br>
be at least 30 wt%, suitably at least 40 wt%, and preferably at least 50 wt%.<br>
Typically, the amount of matrix (A) in the random-heterophasic copolymer<br>
ranges from 60 to 90 wt%, more preferably ranges from 70 to 90 wt%, for some<br>
end applications, however, range from 60 to 85 wt% may be desired.<br>
Accordingly, the amount of rubber component (B) in the random-heterophasic<br>
copolymer may thus be up to 70 wt%, preferably up to 60 wt% and more prefera-<br>
bly up to 50 wt% depending on the property combination desired for the end ap-<br>
plication.<br>
Thus in one embodiment (xvii) rubber (B) in the random-heterophasic copolymer<br>
may range between 5 to 70 wt%, preferably between 5 to 40 wt%, more prefera-<br>
bly in the range of 5 to 30 wt%, and even 10 to 30 wt%.<br>
In another embodiment (xviii), the amount of rubber (B) in said random-<br>
heterophasic copolymer is in the range of 10 to 50 wt%, preferably in the range<br>
of l5 to 40 wt%.<br>
Preferably the amount of matrix (A) in the total random-heterophasic copolymer is at<br>
least 30 wt% and the amount of rubber (B) is not higher than 70 wt%.<br>
In the present invention, the random-heterophasic copolymer may have an MFR2<br>
(measured according to ISO 1133) of 0.01 to 500 g/10 min, preferably in the<br>
range of 0.1 to 100 g/10 min, and more preferably in a range of 1 to 50 g/10 min.<br>
Preferably, the MFR2 of fraction (i) of matrix (A) is lower than the MFR2 ef frac-<br>
tion (ii), i.e. fraction (i) has the higher molecular weight than fraction (ii), or,<br>
alternatively, vice versa.<br>
The falling weight impact (measured according to ISO 6603-2), which describes<br>
the ductile behaviour is preferably down to (-20)°C<br>
Accordingly, the xylene solubles (XS, wt%, as defined below under definitions<br>
and determination methods) of the random-heterophasic copolymer may be up to<br>
60 wt%. Moreover, the xylene solubles in fraction (i) of matrix (A) may be up to<br>

fraction (ii) of matrix (A) may be up to 70wt%, e.g. in the range of 3 to 70 wt%.<br>
The xylene solubles of matrix (A), which is preferably comprised of fractions (i)<br>
and (ii) together, may be up to 50 wt%, e.g. in a range of 3 to 50 wt%.<br>
The xylene solubles in rubber component (B) may be up to 100 wt%, e.g. 10 to<br>
100 wt%, preferably in a range of 50 to 100 wt%.<br>
In one embodiment (xix), the xylene solubles (XS) in fraction (i) of matrix (A)<br>
are in a range of 3 to 15 wt%, preferably 4 to 13 wt%, whereas the xylene solu-<br>
bles (XS) in fraction (ii) of matrix (A) are in a range of 10 to 70 wt%, preferably<br>
in a range of 30 to 70 wt%.<br>
It a further embodiment (xx) the xylene solubles (XS) in matrix (A), which is<br>
preferably comprised of fractions (i) and (ii), are in a range of 4 to 50 wt%, pref-<br>
erably in a range of 15 to 40 wt%.<br>
Moreover, in one embodiment (xxi), the xylene solubles (XS) in rubber compo-<br>
nent (B) may be in the range of 70 to 100 wt%, preferably in the range of 80 to<br>
100 wt%.<br>
In another embodiment (xxii), the random-heterophasic copolymer may have xy-<br>
lene solubles (XS) in the range of 20 to 70 wt%, preferably 30 to 55 wt%.<br>
In a preferable embodiment, the random-heterophasic copolymer is any combina-<br>
tion of embodiments (xx), (xxi) and (xxii).<br>
The intrinsic viscosity of the amorphous part (IV/AM) of the random-<br>
heterophasic copolymer may be up to 5 dl/g, preferably 1 to 4 dl/g, preferably 1<br>
to 2 dl/g, such as 1 to 1.5 dl/g. And for some end applications embodiments<br>
IV/AM of 1 to 3 dl/g may be desired.<br>
The matrix (A) and/or the random-heterophasic copolymer of the invention may<br>
be produced by blending at least part of the components in-situ during the po-<br>
lymerisation process thereof or, alternatively, by blending mechanically one or<br>
more of the separately produced components.<br>
Preferably, matrix (A) and the random-heterophasic copolymer of the invention<br>
is produced by in-situ blending in a multistage polymerisation process, also<br>
called in-situ process. Matrix (A) may be produced first as a multistage process,<br>
wherein fractions thereof are produced in two or more reactors which may be the<br>
same or different and, optionally, in same or different the polymerisation condi-<br>
tions, or, alternatively, in one reactor by changing the catalyst and/or polymerisa-<br>
tion conditions. Furthermore, fractions (i) and (ii) of matrix (A) may be produced<br>
in any order, preferably in different reactors.<br>
In a preferable embodiment, fraction (i) is produced first in a first reactor and<br>
then fraction (ii) is produced in a subsequent reactor in the presence of fraction<br>
(i).<br>
If desired the polymerisation process may include a prepolymerisation step in a<br>
manner known in the field.<br>
Without limiting the invention to any process, rubber component (B) may pref-<br>
erably be produced as a further process step after the formation of matrix (A) in<br>
the same multistage process system as matrix (A). Accordingly, after the forma-<br>
tion of matrix (A), rubber component (B) is preferably produced in. the subse-<br>
quent one or more reactor(s), preferably at least in one gas reactor, in the pres-<br>
ence of matrix (A). Such rubber processes are known in the field.<br>
Preferably, fractions (i) and (ii) of matrix (A) as well as rubber (B) may be pro-<br>
duced using a different or the same polymerisation method including slurry, bulk,<br>
solution and gas phase polymerisation methods.<br>
Preferably, fraction (i) of matrix (A) is formed in a slurry process, in solution or<br>
as bulk polymerisation, preferably as bulk polymerisation. Such process is pref-<br>
erably carried out in a loop reactor.<br>
Fraction (ii) of matrix (A) is preferably performed in a first gas phase reactor,<br>
whereas rubber (B) is typically formed in one or more subsequent reactor, e.g. in<br>
second or further subsequent gas phase reactor(s).<br>
Accordingly, it is preferred that the random-heterophasic copolymer is produced<br>
in an in-situ process, more preferably, fraction (i) of matrix (A) is produced in a<br>
loop reactor, whereas fraction (ii) of matrix (A) is produced in a subsequent first<br>
gas phase reactor in the presence of fraction (i) and rubber (B) is then produced<br>
in a subsequent one or more gas phase reactors, preferably in the presence of<br>
fraction (i) and (ii).<br>
Such process is preferably effected in a "loop"-"first gas phase"-"second or fur-<br>
ther rubber gas phase" -multistage reactor system, preferably such as developed<br>
by Borealis A/S, Denmark, and known as BORSTAR® technology. Such process<br>
is known and described i.a. in W092/12182.<br>
Alternatively, part of the components of the random-heterophasic copolymer may<br>
be made in a multistage process and then blended with the remaining compo-<br>
nents).<br>
The invention thus further provides a "process for producing the random-<br>
heterophasic copolymer as defined above" comprising a matrix (A) with at least<br>
two fractions (i) and (ii) as defined above, wherein the comonomer content of<br>
fraction (i) is lower than the comonomer content of fraction (ii), comprising the<br>
steps of:<br>
-producing matrix (A) by<br>
(a) (co)polymerising in a slurry reactor, e.g. a loop reactor, an alpha-olefin, pref-<br>
erably propylene, and optionally one or more comonomers in the presence of a<br>
polymerisation catalyst, to produce fraction (i), transferring the reaction product<br>
of step (a) to a subsequent gas phase reactor,<br>
(b) copolymerising in a gas phase reactor an alpha-olefin, preferably propylene,<br>
with one or more comonomers in the presence of the reaction product of step (a)<br>
to produce fraction (ii) for obtaining matrix (A), and then<br>
- producing rubber component (B) by<br>
(c) copolymerising in a subsequent second or further gas phase reactor(s) an al-<br>
pha-olefin, preferably propylene, with one or more alpha-olefin comonomers,<br>
preferably at least with ethylene, in the presence of matrix (A) obtained from step<br>
(b),<br>
and recovering the obtained random-heterophasic copolymer.<br>
The process is preferably a continuous process. The comonomer is at least ethyl-<br>
ene, more preferably ethylene.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention the polymerisation conditions for<br>
the slurry reactor of the first stage may be as follows:<br>
the temperature is within the range of 40°C to 110°C, preferably between<br>
60°C and 90°C,<br>
the pressure is within the range of 20 bar to 80 bar, preferably between 30<br>
bar to 60 bar,<br>
hydrogen can be added for controlling the molar mass in a manner known<br>
per se.<br>
The reaction mixture from the slurry (bulk) reactor is transferred to the first gas<br>
phase reactor (second stage). The polymerisation conditions in the first gas phase<br>
reactor may be as follows:<br>
the temperature is within the range of 50°C to 130°C, preferably between<br>
60°C and 100°C.<br>
the pressure is within the range of 5 bar to 50 bar, preferably between 15-<br>
35 bar, in some embodiments also 20 bar to 35 bar may be desired,<br>
hydrogen can be added for controlling the molar mass in a manner known<br>
per se.<br>
The polymerisation conditions in the subsequent one or more gas phase reactors<br>
for preparing rubber component (B), e.g. in the second gas phase reactor in the<br>
third stage of the process, can be the same as in the first gas phase reactor of the<br>
second stage. Typically, in case of ethylene-propylene, the ratio of ethylene to<br>
propylene is 0.1 to 1.5, e.g. 0.3 to 1.0 mol per mol in the reactor.<br>
The process of the invention enables highly feasible means for tailoring matrix<br>
(A) of the invention. The properties of the final polymer, i.a. MW, MWD and<br>
thus MFR2 and IV (intrinsic viscosity) of matrix (A) and rubber component (B),<br>
can be controlled e.g. with one or more of the following process parameters: hy-<br>
drogen feed, comonomer feed, alpha-olefin feed in the gas phase reactor, pref-<br>
erably propylene and comonomer feeds, catalyst, the type and amount of an ex-<br>
ternal donor (if used), split between fraction (i) and (ii) and the weight ratio of<br>
matrix (A) to rubber component (B).<br>
Furthermore, the crystallinity of the random-heterophasic copolymer can be fur-<br>
ther modified during or after the polymerisation step with nucleating agents in a<br>
manner known in the art, e.g. using nucleating systems are described i.a. in WO<br>
9924478 and WO 9924479.<br>
The obtained copolymer product may also be subjected to an extrusion and/or a<br>
further treatment steps in a known manner to obtain pellets.<br>
The produced random-heterophasic copolymer of the invention may, if desired,<br>
be thus subjected to different treatment steps for further modifying the polymer<br>
properties in a known manner, e.g. to a visbreaking, for adjusting, i.e. increasing,<br>
the MFR of the product by using conventional methods and organic peroxides.<br>
The random-heterophasic copolymer can be produced by using any suitable po-<br>
lymerisation catalyst.<br>
Preferably, a coordination catalyst is employed, more preferably of the group of<br>
transition metals, still more preferably of the transition metals of Group 3 to 10, ac-<br>
tinides and lanthanides of the Periodic Table (IUPAC, 1989), such as a Ziegler-<br>
Natta-catalyst, a metallocene-catalyst, a non-metallocene-catalyst, or any mxture<br>
thereof. Most preferably, Ziegler-Natta catalyst comprising titanium and chlorine<br>
is used.<br>
Preferred catalysts are those as disclosed e.g. in US 5234879, W092/19653,<br>
W092/19658, W099/33843, WO03/000754 and WO03/000757. The documents<br>
are included herewith by reference. The preferred catalyst used in the above<br>
process is a high activity, stereoselective Ziegler-Natta type polymerisation cata-<br>
lyst system comprising a solid catalyst component, cocatalyst and an external<br>
donor. The catalyst may or may not be supported with an external support, e.g.<br>
silica. Alternatively, a Mg-based support system may be used.<br>
In one preferred embodiment for producing a heterophasic polymer copolymer as<br>
defined above, a procatalyst is used which has been prepared by bringing to-<br>
gether MgC12, a lower alcohol, a titanium compound and an ester of phthalic<br>
acid, whereby a transesterification has been carried out at a temperature between<br>
110 und 150 °C between the lower alcohol and the ester of the phthalic acid,<br>
whereby the alcoxy group of the phthalic acid ester comprises at least five carbon<br>
atoms. Such catalyst is known and can be prepared according or analogously to<br>
the literature e.g. as described in US 5234879, WO 92/19653, W092/19658 or<br>
W099/33843 which are included herewith by reference.<br>
In another preferred embodiment a catalyst is used as described in detail below.<br>
This catalyst is known in the field and can be prepared according or analogously<br>
to the so called emulsion method described e.g. in WO 03/000754 and WO<br>
03/000757. Preferably the catalyst has a low surface area, whereby the catalyst<br>
component comprises a compound of a transition metal of Group 3 to 10 of the<br>
Periodic Table, or actinide or lanthanide. The most preferred catalysts for this<br>
embodiment and their preparation.<br>
The present invention is also related to a random-heterophasic copolymer obtain-<br>
able by the "process for preparing the random-heterophasic copolymer" as de-<br>
fined above.<br>
According to a first embodiment, the random-heterophasic copolymer is obtain-<br>
able by the "process for preparing the random-heterophasic copolymer" as de-<br>
fined above using a polymerization catalyst as disclosed in US 5234879,<br>
W092/19653, W092/19658 or W099/33843.<br>
According to a second embodiment, the random-heterophasic copolymer is ob-<br>
tainable by the "process for preparing the random-heterophasic copolymer" as<br>
defined above using a polymerisation catalyst as disclosed in WO 03/000754 or<br>
WO 03/000757, which catalyst comprises a compound of a transition metal of<br>
Group 3 to 10 of the Periodic Table (IUPAC), or of an actinide or lanthanide, and<br>
is prepared according to a "catalyst preparation method" comprising<br>
(a) forming a liquid/liquid emulsion system, which contains a homogeneous<br>
solution of at least one catalyst component, said solution being dispersed in<br>
a solvent immiscible therewith and forming the dispersed phase of the liq-<br>
uid/liquid emulsion system,<br>
(b) solidifying said dispersed droplets to form solid catalyst particles having a<br>
predetermined size range,<br>
(c) removing the solvent from the reaction mixture in order to obtain said solid<br>
catalyst particles.<br>
Hence, according to the second embodiment of the "process for preparing the<br>
random-heterophasic copolymer" as defined above, the polymerisation catalyst<br>
used is a ZN-catalyst which is prepared by the "catalyst preparation method" as<br>
defined above.<br>
The invention also provides a random-heterophasic copolymer as defined above<br>
which is obtainable by the "process for preparing the random-heterophasic co-<br>
polymer" as defined above, wherein a polymerisation catalyst is used which is a<br>
ZN-catalyst prepared by the "catalyst preparation method" as defined above.<br>
The ZN catalyst which is prepared by the "catalyst preparation method" as de-<br>
fined above enables to produce a random-heterophasic copolymer with very low<br>
stiffness. Said catalyst is very suitable for producing a random-heterophasic co-<br>
polymer of one or more the embodiments (i), (iv) and (vi).<br>
The flexural modulus (stiffness, FM, MPa) can be expressed with the following<br>
formula (I) for a specific subgroup (I) of a random-heterophasic propylene co-<br>
polymer with ethylene as the comonomer:<br>
FM = 426 - 22,3 x C20n + 1.71 x C2AM - 6.76 x R + 85.1 x IVAM (I),<br>
wherein:<br>
C2(ii) is ethylene, content in fraction (ii) of matrix (A) in wt%,<br>
C2AM is ethylene content in the amorphous part of the random-heterophasic co-<br>
polymer in wt%,<br>
R is the amount (wt%) of rubber component (B), preferably material produced in<br>
the second gas phase reactor, based on consumption of ethylene and propylene,<br>
given in wt% of the random-heterophasic copolymer,<br>
IVa.m is the intrinsic viscosity of the amorphous part of the random-heterophasic<br>
copolymer in dl/g;<br>
provided that the calculated flexural modulus FM is above 100 MPa, and<br>
that the random-heterophasic propylene copolymer has the following combina-<br>
tion:<br>
(a) ethylene content in fraction (i) is 4 to 5 wt%,<br>
(b) split between fractions (i) and (ii) is 55/45 - 65/35 per weight, and<br>
(c) C2(ii) is 4 to 20 wt%, said formula (I) being particularly suitable in the range<br>
of 5.5-13 wt%,<br>
(d) C2AM is 15 to 50 wt%, said formula (I) being particularly suitable in the range<br>
of 15 to 40 wt%,<br>
(e) R, preferably obtained from 2nd gas phase reactor of a multistage process, is<br>
10 to 40 wt%, said formula (I) being particularly suitable in the range of 18 to 35<br>
wt%, and<br>
(f) IVAM is 1.0 to 3.5 dl/g, said formula (I) being particularly suitable in the<br>
range of 2 to 3 dl/g.<br>
Furthermore, MFR2 (ISO 1133) is typically 1 to 2 g/10 min, but it is apparent for<br>

Definitions and determination methods<br>
The following definitions for the used terms as well as the determination methods<br>
for the characterizing values/parameters used herein to describe the random-<br>
heterophasic copolymer of the invention and the properties thereof apply gener-<br>
ally for the description part above and for the examples below, unless otherwise<br>
stated:<br>
- Weight-% is abbreviated as w% or wt-%<br>
- The xylene solubles (XS) -fraction contains amorphous polymer chains. It is<br>
preferable that fraction (i) has a lower XS-fraction than fraction (ii). Low stiff-<br>
ness and impact strength increases with increasing the fraction of xylene solubles<br>
in the fraction (ii) and/or in the rubber component (B).<br>
-XS (xylene solubles) and AM (amorphous part) were analyzed by the known<br>
method:<br>
2.0 g of polymer was dissolved in 250 ml p-xylene at 135°C under agitation. Af-<br>
ter 30±2 minutes the solution was allowed to cool for 15 minutes at ambient tem-<br>
perature and then allowed to settle for 30 minutes at 25±0.5°C. The solution was<br>
filtered with filter paper into two 100 ml flasks.<br>
The solution from the first 100 ml vessel was evaporated in nitrogen flow and the<br>
residue dried under vacuum at 90°C until constant weight is reached.<br>
XS%=(100 x m1 x v0) / (m0 x V1), wherein<br>
mo= initial polymer amount (g)<br>
m1= weight of residue (g)<br>
v0= initial volume (ml)<br>
V1= volume of analyzed sample (ml)<br>
The solution from the second 100 ml flask was treated with 200 ml of acetone<br>
under vigorous stirring. The precipitate was filtered and dried in a vacuum oven<br>
at 90°C.<br>
AM%=(100 x m2 x v0) / (m0 x v1), wherein<br>
m0= initial polymer amount (g)<br>
m1= weight of precipitate (g)<br>
v0= initial volume (ml)<br>
V1= volume of analyzed sample (ml)<br>
- The intrinsic viscosity (IV) value is increasing with the molecular weight of a<br>
polymer. IV of AM: measured according to ISO 1628.<br>
- MFR2: measured according to ISO 1133 (230°C, 2.16 kg load).<br>
- Comonomer content (wt%) was determined in a known manner based on Fou-<br>
rier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) determination calibrated with C13-<br>
NMR.<br>
- Multimodality, including bimodality, with respect to the comonomer distri-<br>
bution, is demonstrated herein with the different comonomer content (wt%) be-<br>
tween the components of the random-heterophasic copolymer, e.g. between the<br>
fractions (i) and (ii) of the matrix (A), which comonomer content is determined<br>
using said FTIR method described above.<br>
-The optional multimodality, including bimodality, with respect to the mo-<br>
lecular weight distribution (MWD) means that the molecular weight profile of<br>
e.g. the random copolymer component (A) does not comprise a single peak but<br>
instead comprises two or more distinct maxima, a maximum and one or more<br>
shoulders centered about different average molecular weights, or in some cases a<br>
distinctly broadened curve. The fraction (i) may comprise a higher MW compo-<br>
nent than fraction (ii), or vice versa. E.g. it is possible to produce the fraction (i)<br>
as the HMW component in the preferable loop-gas phase process of the invention<br>
and the fraction (ii) in the subsequent gas phase reactor as the LMW component.<br>
The MWD can be determined e.g. by using a size exclusion chromatography<br>
(SEC) in a manner known in the art.<br>
- Thermal properties of polymer was analyzed with a differential scanning calo-<br>
rimeter and according to the method:<br>
Melting temperature Tm, crystallization temperature Tc, and the degree of<br>
crystallinity were measured with Mettler TA820 differential scanning calo-<br>
rimetry (DSC) on 3±0.5 mg samples. Both crystallization and melting curves<br>
were obtained during 10°C/min cooling and heating scans between 30°C and<br>
225°C. Melting and crystallization temperatures were taken as the peaks of endo-<br>
therms and exotherms. The degree of crystallinity was calculated by comparison<br>
with heat of fusion of a perfectly crystalline polypropylene, i.e. 209 J/g.<br>
- Instrumental falling weight impact (IFWI): was measured according to ISO<br>
6603-2.<br>
- Flexural modulus: was measured according to ISO 178 (room temperature, if<br>
not otherwise mentioned) by using injection moulded test specimens as described<br>
in EN ISO 1873-2 (80x10x4 mm).<br>
- Charpy notched impact: was measured accoding to ISO 179 (room tempera-<br>
ture, if not otherwise informed) and at -20 °C by using injection moulded test<br>
specimens as described in EN ISO 1873-2 (80x10x4 mm)<br>
- Tensile strength: (tensile stress at yield) was measured according to ISO 572-2<br>
(cross head speed = 50 mm/min)<br>
- Tensile modulus: was measured according to ISO 572-2 (cross head speed = 1<br>
mm/min)<br>
The present invention will now be described by way of examples: The raw mate-<br>
rials are e.g. commercially available or can be produced according or analo-<br>
gously to the known methods described in literature, unless otherwise specified.<br>
Example 1<br>
All raw materials were essentially free from water and air and all material addi-<br>
tions to the reactor and the different steps were done under inert conditions in a<br>
nitrogen atmosphere. The water content in propylene was less than 5 ppm.<br>
The polymerisation (bulk polymerisation step) was done in a 5 litre reactor,<br>
which was heated, vacuumed and purged with nitrogen before use. 407 ul TEA<br>
(triethyl aluminium, from Witco used as received), 69 ul external donor (dicyclo<br>
pentyl dimethoxy silane, from Wacker, dried with molecular sieves) and 30 ml<br>

allowed to react for 5 minutes. Half of the mixture was added to the reactor and<br>
the other half was mixed with 20,1 mg highly active and stereo specific Ziegler<br>
Natta catalyst (ZN catalyst). The ZN catalyst was prepared according to patent<br>
WO03/000754, example 7, and had Ti content 2,84 w%. After about 10 minutes<br>
the ZN catalyst/TEA/external donor/pentane mixture was added to the reactor.<br>

creased from room temperature to 70°C during 18 minutes. The reaction was<br>
stopped, after 30 minutes at 70°C by flashing out unreacted monomer. Finally the<br>
polymer powder was taken out from the reactor and analyzed and tested. The<br>

ture. 70 mmol hydrogen was added and the temperature was increased to 70°C<br>
and pressure with the aforementioned ethylene/propylene mixture up to 20 bar<br>
during 13 minutes. Consumption of ethylene and propylene was followed from<br>
scales. The reaction was allowed to continue until a 60/40 split between polymer<br>
amount produced in the bulk stage (fraction (i)) and polymer amount produced in<br>
the gas phase (fraction (ii)) was reached. The MFR of the final product was 2,7<br>

the ethylene/propylene molar ratio in the feed was 0,30 and hydrogen amount 110<br>
mmol. MFR of the final product was 1,3, the total ethylene content 16,0 w%, XS<br>
51,1 w% and flexural modulus 159 MPa.<br>
Example 12<br>
This example was done in accordance with Example 1, with the exception that<br>
the catalyst used in this test can be described as a typical 4th generation Ziegler<br>
Natta catalyst for producing high isotacticity and high stiffness products. The<br>
catalyst was prepared in accordance with W092/19653. The catalyst contained<br>
2,1 w% titanium. The product produced in bulk contained 4,8 w% ethylene and<br>
MFR was 1,8. Other details are shown in table 2.<br>
Example 13<br>
This example was done in accordance with Example 12, but after the bulk stage<br>
the polymerisation was continued in gas phase. The temperature was 80°C, hy-<br>
drogen 60 mmol and ethylene/propylene molar ratio 0,11 in feed. Ethylene con-<br>
tent in the product was 6,4 w% MFR 2,4 and XS 20,6 w%. The split between<br>
bulk and first gas phase was 50/50. The ethylene content in the gas phase mate-<br>
rial was 7,7 w%. Other details are seen in table 2.<br>
Example 14<br>
This example was done in accordance with Example 13, but after the first gas<br>
phase stage the reaction was continued in the second gas phase stage (rubber<br>
stage). The temperature was 70°C, hydrogen 70 mmol and ethylene/propylene<br>
molar ratio in feed 0,57. MFR of the final product was 0,80, the total ethylene<br>
content 16,4 w%, XS 37,5 w% and flexural modulus 350 MPa. Other details are<br>
shown in table 2.<br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
This example was done in accordance with Example 13, except that ethyl-<br>
ene/propylene molar ratio in feed was 0,07. MFR of the product was 2,2, ethyl-<br>
ene content 5,1 w% and XS 9,9 w%. The split between bulk and first gas phase<br>
was 54/46. The ethylene content in the first gas phase material was adjusted to<br>
correspond to the ethylene content of the bulk product (within the limits of the<br>
measurement accuracy), so that there were no difference in the comonomer con-<br>
tents between the bulk product (fraction i) and the product of the first gas phase<br>
reactor (fraction ii) and thus no difference between the ethylene content of the<br>
bulk product and the obtained matrix ("one phase matrix"). Other details are seen<br>
in table 2.<br>
Comparative Example 2<br>
This example was done in accordance with Comparative Example 1, but after the<br>
first gas phase stage the reaction was continued in the second gas phase stage<br>
(rubber stage) as described in example 14. MFR of the product was 0,8, ethylene<br>
content 14,9 w%, XS 31 w% and flexural modulus 480 MPa.<br>
The experiments of tables 1 and 2 below were made in laboratory scale, thus due<br>
to the small-scale measurement accuracy, slight variations in the measured values<br>
may occur between individual examples and when compared to the results ob-<br>
tained from the pilot plant experiments shown in below tables 3 to 5.<br>
The examples show the improved combination of the high Tm and low flexural<br>
modulus achieved with the present composition comprising "the matrix of two<br>
fractions with different comonomer contents". Furthermore, the table 2 shows a<br>
comparison between the products of example 14 of the invention and the Com-<br>
parative example 2 representing the prior art. The product of Comparative exam-<br>
ple 2 corresponds to that of example 14, except that, although the total ethylene<br>
content in the matrix of Comparative example 2 is comparable (within the meas-<br>
urement accuracy) with that of example 14, however there is no difference be-<br>
tween the comonomer content of the bulk product (fraction (i)) and the first gas<br>
phase product (fraction (ii)) in the matrix of Comparative example 2, and thus no<br>
difference between the comonomer content of the bulk product (fraction (i)) and<br>
the obtained final product (matrix (A)) thereof. As a result, the product of exam-<br>
ple 14 has the same melting temperature (about 138 °C), but clearly lower flexu-<br>
lar modulus (350 MPa) over that of Comparative example 2 (480 MPa).<br>
Generally, the melting temperature of the random copolymers, preferably ethyl-<br>
ene-propylene random copolymers, decreases with increasing comonomer, pref-<br>
ereably ethylene, content in case of a matrix of "one phase material". This is also<br>
shown by the continuous curve ("one phase material, general") in figure 1 using<br>
ethylene as the comonomer in the random copolymer. The figure 1 shows the<br>
different behaviour of the "matrix of two fractions with different comonomer<br>
content", wherein the fraction (i) (Bulk material, Ex 1) with lower ethylene con-<br>
tent controls the melting temperature of the obtained "two fraction matrix"<br>
(Bulk/gas phase material, ex 2, 5 and 8). In Examples 2, 5 and 8 a bulk/gas phase<br>
reactor configuration was used.<br>
In the present case, the melting point of the polymer is not controlled by the total<br>
ethylene content in the copolymer, but by the ethylene content of the material<br>
produced in the bulk. The melting point of the bulk/gas phase materials in this<br>
experiment was a few degrees lower than that of the bulk material (the differ-<br>
ences may also due to the measurement accuracy, see above), but, in general, the<br>
melting point does not decrease markedly with increasing comonomer content.<br>
This is because in all three examples the bulk part of the bulk/gas phase material<br>
is the same (Example 1). It is only the comonomer, e.g. ethylene, content in the<br>
gas phase part that increases. Accordingly, the comonomer, e.g. ethylene, content<br>
of fraction (ii) can be increased enabling to increase the total amount of the co-<br>
monomer, which will increase XS and decrease stiffness (as shown in figure 2),<br>
while still keeping melting point on an unchanged high level.<br>
As examples show different catalyst can be used for producing the random co-<br>
polymer of the invention. Furthermore, it was also found, as shown from figure<br>
2 that with the catalyst prepared according to the emulsion system described in<br>
WO03/000754 ("catalyst preaparation method") and used in the examples 1-11<br>
even more decreased stiffness can be obtained for the polymer products com-<br>
pared e.g. to the catalyst described in W092/19653 and used in examples 12 to<br>
14. The stiffness in the examples 3, 4, 6, 7 and 9-11 with 20 wt% rubber is on the<br>
same level as in example 14 with 30 wt% rubber.<br>
Examples 15 to 23<br>
The examples 15 to 23 were prepared in a continuous multistage process in pilot<br>
scale comprising a loop reactor and a fluidised bed gas phase reactor as follows:.<br>
The catalyst used was a known, highly active, stereospecific transesterified<br>
MgCb-supported Ziegler-Natta catalyst prepared according to US 5234879. The<br>
catalyst was contacted with triethylaluminium (TEAL) as a cocatalyst and an ex-<br>
ternal donor (dicyclopentyl dimethoxysilane). The catalysts used in the examples<br>
are further characterized in the tables 3, 4 and 5. The catalyst was prepolymer-<br>
ised in a known manner in the presence of propylene and the cocatalyst in a sepa-<br>
rate prepolymerisation step. Then propylene, ethylene and hydrogen were fed<br>
together with the activated catalyst into the loop reactor which operated as a bulk<br>
reactor at conditions given in tables 3 to 5 (production of fraction (i)). Then the<br>
polymer slurry stream was fed from the loop reactor into the gas phase reactor<br>
and more propylene, ethylene and hydrogen were fed in the gas phase reactor<br>
(production of fraction (ii) in the presence of fraction (i) to obtain the matrix<br>
(A)). The polymerisation conditions therein are given in tables 3 to 5. The rubber<br>
was produced with a C2/C3 ratio 500 mol per kmol and the IV was adjusted with<br>
the hydrogen feed.<br>
The products of examples were subjected to visbreaking after the polymerisation<br>
of the random-heterophasic copolymer to increase the MFR from 1.5 to 8 g/10<br>
min. The visbreaking was effected in a known manner.<br>
Tables 3, 4 and 5 the properties obtained for the polymer products of examples<br>
15 to 23.<br>
As already mentioned the invention enables the increase the comonomer content<br>
in fraction (ii) of the random PP produced e.g. in a first gas phase reactor,<br>
whereby higher ethylene content and higher amount of XS in the final polymer<br>
can be achieved, and thus the stiffness (flexural modulus) be decreased, while<br>
keeping the melting point essentially in the same level determined by the fraction<br>
(i). Furthermore, the stiffness may also be decreased i.a. by means of the amount<br>
and/or comonomer content (and thus XS) of the rubber part (B) (e.g. the product<br>
of the second or further gas phase reactor) in the final random-heterophasic co-<br>
polymer composition. Accordingly, in case of example 15, for instance, the in-<br>
crease in the ethylene content in the fraction (ii) (in product of the first gas phase<br>
reactor) and/or the increase of the amount and/or XS value of the rubber (B) (the<br>
product of the second gas phase reactor) would decrease the flexural modulus<br>
further.<br>
As shown in table 5, visbreaking causes a slight decrease in the flexural modulus<br>
over the non-visbreaking products enabling the further tailoring of the product.<br>
