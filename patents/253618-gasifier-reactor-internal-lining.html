				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention concerns a gasifier reactor internal lining.<br>
There is known in the art in particular a gasifier used to gasify coal. The coal<br>
gasification process, that has been known in the art for around fifty years, is currently<br>
experiencing strong growth because it can be used, starting from highly diverse<br>
hydrocarbon materials, for example coal, petroleum coke, and even heavy oils to be<br>
recycled, to produce synthesis gases serving as an energy source and as basic compounds<br>
for the chemical industry. This process also eliminates unwanted components, for example<br>
NOx, sulfur or mercury, before discharge into the atmosphere.<br>
The principle of gasification consists in controlled partial combustion, under<br>
pressure and in a steam or oxygen atmosphere, at a temperature from approximately<br>
1000°C to approximately 1600°C.<br>
There exist different types of reactor, known as "gasifiers", with fixed, fluidized<br>
or driven beds. These reactors differ in the mode of introduction of the reactants, the<br>
manner in which the fuel and the oxidizer are mixed, the temperature and pressure<br>
conditions, and the method of evacuating liquid residual slag or ash resulting from the<br>
reaction.<br>
The article "Refractories for Gasification" published in the journal "Refractories<br>
Applications and News", Volume 8, Number 4, July-August 2003, written by Wade Taber<br>
of the Energy Systems department of the Saint-Gobain Industrial Ceramics Division,<br>
describes the structure of a gasifier internal lining. The gasifier is coated with various<br>
layers of refractory products capable of withstanding the conditions of temperature,<br>
pressure and chemical environment to which they are subjected during gasification. The<br>
layers of refractory products thus protect the metal interior wall of the gasifier from heat<br>
and from corrosion by gases and slag.<br>
The refractory product at the hot face is more particularly subjected to erosion<br>
and chemical attack by ash or slag, which leads to the infiltration of compounds from the<br>
liquefied ash or slag into the pores of the refractory product. As a result of erosion and<br>
thermal cycling, this infiltration can cause spalling of the lining, and finally to shutting<br>
down of the reactor.<br><br>
To increase the service life of refractory linings, researchers have attempted to<br>
increase their thickness. However, this solution has the drawback of reducing the usable<br>
volume of the gasifier and therefore its yield.<br>
James P. Bennett, in the article "Refractory liner used in slagging gasifiers"<br>
published in the journal "Refractories Applications and News", Vol 9, Number 5,<br>
September/October 2004, pages 20-25, explains that the service life of current gasifier<br>
refractory linings, in particular in air-cooled systems, is very limited despite their high<br>
content of chromium oxide. He mentions in particular the report by S.J. Clayton, G.J.<br>
Stiegel and J.G. Wimer "Gasification Technologies, Gasification Markets and<br>
Technologies - Present and future, an Industry Perspective", US DOE report DOE/FE<br>
0447, July 2002.<br>
There is therefore a requirement for a refractory lining adapted to resist the<br>
corrosion encountered in gasifiers more effectively and more durably than prior art<br>
products.<br>
The object of the invention is to satisfy this requirement.<br>
According to the invention, the above object is achieved by means of a gasifier<br>
internal refractory lining having at least one region of a sintered material containing at<br>
least 45% by weight of chromium oxide (Cr2O3) and at least 1%, preferably at least 2 %,<br>
and more preferably at least 3 %, by weight of zirconium oxide (ZrO2), at least 20%,<br>
preferably at least 30 %, by weight of said zirconium oxide (ZrO2) being stabilized in the<br>
cubic and/or quadratic form.<br>
As will emerge in more detail in the remainder of the description, surprisingly,<br>
the presence of at least 1% zirconium oxide of which at least 20% by weight is stabilized<br>
in the cubic and/or quadratic form reduces infiltration and attack by slag without<br>
degrading the other functional properties of the lining.<br>
Said lining material of the invention preferably has one or more of the following<br>
optional features:<br>
- At least 60% of the zirconium oxide is stabilized in the cubic and/or quadratic<br>
form.<br><br>
-	Said material contains at least one dopant, stabilizing or not stabilizing the<br>
zirconium oxide, selected from CaO, MgO, Y2O3 and TiO2, the preferred dopant being<br>
CaO. The content of calcium oxide (CaO) of said material is preferably less than 1,0 % by<br>
weight. The dopant preferably stabilizes the zirconium oxide, at least in part.<br>
-	The content of zirconium oxide (ZrO2) is greater than 4.5%, preferably greater<br>
than 6% by weight, and/or less than 7% by weight.<br>
-	The content of chromium oxide (Cr2O3) is greater than 60% by weight and<br>
preferably greater than 80% by weight.<br>
-	Said material has an aluminum oxide (Al2O3) content greater than 1% by<br>
weight, preferably greater than 2% by weight, and/or less than 10% by weight, preferably<br>
less than 5% by weight, preferably less than 3.5% by weight.<br>
-	Said material has a silica content greater than O.5% by weight, preferably<br>
greater than 1% by weight, and/or less than 3% by weight, preferably less than 1.5% by<br>
weight.<br>
-	The sum of the contents of oxides of chromium (Cr2O3), zirconium (ZrO2),<br>
aluminum (Al2O3), silicon (SiO2) and calcium oxide (CaO) is greater than 95%, preferably<br>
greater than 98%, by weight, the other constituents of the product being impurities. The<br>
impurities conventionally comprise iron essentially in the form of Fe2O3 and oxides of<br>
alkali metals such as Na2O and K2O. Such contents of impurities are not considered to call<br>
into question the advantages obtained from using the material.<br>
-	The structure of the material features a granulate of chromium oxide bound by a<br>
matrix comprising grains including zirconium oxide and a dopant selected from CaO,<br>
MgO, Y2O3 and TiO2, the dopant, stabilizing or not stabilizing the zirconium oxide, the<br>
percentage of zirconium oxide contained in said grains being greater than 1%, preferably<br>
greater than 2.5%, by weight relative to the weight of the material. The dopant content in<br>
the grains containing zirconium oxide and a dopant is preferably from 1% to 8% by weight<br>
relative to the weight of said grains. Preferably, this dopant content is greater than or equal<br>
to 3% and/or less than or equal to 6%.<br>
-	Preferably, the dopant is selected from CaO, MgO and Y2O3, preferably from<br>
MgO and CaO. The prefered dopant is CaO.<br><br>
- The material takes the form of a layer applied to the interior wall of a reactor of<br>
the gasifier or of an assembly of blocks arranged to protect said wall. The whole of the<br>
layer or all the blocks of the assembly preferably consist(s) of a material such as that<br>
defined hereinabove.<br>
In the present description, all percentages are percentages by weight unless<br>
otherwise indicated.<br>
The composition of the slags in gasifiers typically consists of SiO2, FeO or Fe2O3,<br>
CaO and Al2O3. It may also include other oxides derived from products feeding the<br>
reactor. The base index B = (CaO + MgO + Fe2O3)/(Al2O3 + SiO2) is typically about O.6<br>
and the ratio C/S = CaO/SiO2 is typically O.4, the contents being expressed as percentages<br>
by weight.<br>
Wang Zhe, as reported in the paper "Application of ZrO2 in high Cr2O3 low<br>
cement castable refractories for Refuse Melter" published in the proceedings of the 8th<br>
Biennial UNITEC Congress "Worldwide Conference Refractories ECO Refractory For<br>
The Earth" held from 19-22 October 2003 in Osaka (Japan), studied the behavior of<br>
products with high chromium oxide and aluminum oxide contents, containing no silicon<br>
oxide, in relation to corrosive slags encountered in furnaces for incineration of domestic or<br>
industrial waste. The addition of a highly stabilized zirconia in cubic form representing<br>
from 3.2% to 6.4% of the total composition is described as unfavorable to resistance to<br>
dissolution by the slags cited in the above publication. However, incineration furnace slags<br>
are very different from those of gasifiers, as they have the following characteristics: B<br>
index of approximately 1.2; C/S ratio of approximately 1.5.<br>
A lining must be adapted to the corrosive conditions that it encounters. Thus it<br>
cannot be expected that a lining known to be resistant to certain corrosive conditions will<br>
be equally resistant when subjected to other corrosive conditions. Thus it is found that<br>
materials conforming to the invention include the materials described by Wang Zhe as<br>
ineffective for waste incineration furnaces. Surprisingly, the inventors have discovered<br>
that these materials are effective in an application to a gasifier lining.<br>
In applications such as glassmaking furnaces or iron and steel furnaces, as<br>
described in the patent EP 0 404 610, for example, there are known in the art products<br>
consisting of zirconium oxide and chromium oxide. These products contain zirconium<br>
oxide in a proportion from 1% to 9% by weight relative to the total composition.<br>
According to the above patent, it is essential that at least 80% of the zirconium oxide be in<br><br>
the monoclinic form, monoclinic zirconium being described as the "key ingredient" for<br>
improving resistance to thermal shocks. Surprisingly, in the light of this teaching, the<br>
inventors have discovered that, in the application to a gasifier lining, the presence of<br>
zirconium oxide stabilized to at least 20% is, on the contrary, advantageous.<br>
Zirconium oxide can be stabilized by means of a stabilizing dopant and/or by heat<br>
treatment at very high temperature (typically greater than 1700°C). According to the<br>
invention at least 20% by weight of the zirconium oxide is stabilized in the cubic and/or<br>
quadratic form.<br>
A dopant selected from CaO, MgO, Y2O3 and TiO2, acting or not acting as a<br>
stabilizer, is preferably present in the lining material of the invention.<br>
The refractory lining material of the invention consists of one or more granulates,<br>
i.e. particles having a particle size greater than 150 µm, surrounded by a binder matrix.<br>
The granulates may have diverse chemical compositions, in particular they can<br>
consist of chromium oxide, the total content of chromium oxide of the material being at<br>
least 45% by weight.<br>
The binder matrix comprises grains, i.e. particles having a particle size less than<br>
150 µm, including zirconium oxide and a dopant. According to the invention, the<br>
zirconium oxide alone present in these grains preferably represents more than 2.5% of the<br>
total weight of the material. In these grains, the dopant may have the function of<br>
stabilizing the zirconium oxide or not. The binder matrix may further comprise other<br>
grains, in particular grains of zirconium oxide with no dopant.<br>
The lining of the invention may be fabricated in the form of a layer obtained from<br>
a non-worked product or in the form of an assembly of refractory blocks.<br>
To fabricate a lining in the form of a layer, a base mixture is prepared of particles<br>
of chromium oxide and zirconia, and possibly other oxides, in proportions determined as a<br>
function of the composition of the required material. The dopant may be added to the<br>
mixture and/or be included with the zirconia, as a stabilizer. Forming additives may be<br>
added to facilitate use, preferably in a proportion of less than 7%.<br>
The manner of determining the proportions of the constituents of the base mixture<br>
is well known to the person skilled in the art. In particular, the person skilled in the art<br><br>
knows that the chromiµm, aluminum and zirconium oxides present in the base mixture are<br>
found in the sintered refractory material. Certain oxides of this material can also be<br>
introduced by the additives. The composition of the base mixture may therefore vary, in<br>
particular as a function of the quantities and the nature of the additives present.<br>
The chromium oxide may be added in the form of a mixture of sintered or fused<br>
chromium oxide particles. The aluminum oxide may be added in the form of a mixture of<br>
calcined or reactive particles of alumina, or even of white corundum. The zirconium oxide<br>
may be added in the form of commercially available unstabilized zirconia and/or in the<br>
form of stabilized zirconia, for example zirconia from Unitec, in powder form.<br>
A powder is made up of particles of which 90% by weight have a particle size<br>
less than 150 µm.<br>
The base mixture preferably includes at least 0.2% by weight of stabilized<br>
zirconia powder.<br>
The base mixture preferably includes:<br>
-	at least 60% of a particular mixture based on oxides of which at least 90% by<br>
weight consists of particles having a particle size greater than 150 microns but less than<br>
20 mm;<br>
-	less than 40%) of a mixture of particles, at least 90% by weight of the particles<br>
having a particle size less than 150 µm;<br>
-	less than 7% of one or more forming additives well known to the person skilled<br>
in the art.<br>
The base mixture is preferably homogenized and conditioned. A mixture of this<br>
kind is advantageously ready for use and may be applied to the interior wall of the reactor,<br>
for example by casting, vibrocasting or spraying, as a function of requirements and with<br>
great flexibility, and then sintered in situ during preheating of the reactor, to produce a<br>
refractory lining of the invention. Sintering occurs at atmospheric pressure, in an oxidizing<br>
atmosphere and at a temperature from 1300°C to 1600°C.<br><br>
To fabricate a lining of the invention, it is equally possible to assemble sintered<br>
blocks or prefabricated blocks which are then sintered in service when the reactor is<br>
heated up.<br>
To fabricate a sintered block, a fabrication method may be used that includes the<br>
following successive steps:<br>
a)	preparing a charge,<br>
b)	forming said charge in a mold,<br>
c)	casting said charge in the mold or compacting the charge by vibration and/or<br>
pressing and/or pounding of said charge in the mold to form a preform,<br>
d)	removing the preform from the mold,<br>
e)	drying said preform, preferably in air or a moisture-controlled atmosphere, and<br>
preferably so that the residual moisture content of the preform is from 0 to O.5%,<br>
f)	firing said preform in an oxidizing atmosphere at a temperature from 1300°C to<br>
1600°C to form a fashioned refractory product, or a sintered "refractory block".<br>
Like the base mixture described above, the charge includes oxides determined as<br>
a function of the final composition of the block, precursors thereof and temporary forming<br>
additives.<br>
The steps a) to f) are steps conventionally employed in the art to fabricate<br>
sintered products.<br>
In step a), the manner of determining the quantities of the constituents of the<br>
refractory product is well known to the person skilled in the art. In particular, the person<br>
skilled in the art knows that the chromiµm, aluminum and zirconium oxides present in the<br>
starting charge are found in the fabricated refractory product. Certain oxides may also be<br>
introduced by the additives. For the same quantity of constituents of the sintered refractory<br>
product, the composition of the starting charge may therefore vary, in particular as a<br>
function of the quantities and the nature of the additives present in the charge.<br><br>
The additives may be added to the starting charge to ensure that it is sufficiently<br>
plasticized during the step b) of forming it and to confer sufficient mechanical strength on<br>
the preform obtained at the end of the steps d) and e). Non-limiting examples of additives<br>
that may be used are:<br>
-	organic temporary binders (i.e. binders that are eliminated wholly or in part<br>
during drying and firing steps), such as resins, derivatives of cellulose or lignone,<br>
polyvinyl alcohols; the quantity of temporary binder is preferably from O.1% to 6% by<br>
weight relative to the weight of the particular mixture of the charge;<br>
-	forming agents such as stearates of magnesium or calcium;<br>
-	hydraulic binders such as CaO aluminate cement;<br>
-	deflocculating agents such as alkaline polyphosphates or methacrylate<br>
derivatives;<br>
-	sintering promoters such as titanium dioxide or magnesium hydroxide;<br>
-	clay type additives that facilitate use and assist sintering; the above additives<br>
introduce alumina and silica and a few oxides of alkali or alkaline-earth metals, even iron<br>
oxide, depending on the type of clay.<br>
The above quantities of additives are not limiting on the invention. In particular,<br>
the quantities conventionally used in sintering processes are appropriate.<br>
The mixing of the various constituents of the charge continues until a<br>
substantially homogeneous mass is obtained.<br>
In the step b), the charge is formed and disposed in a mold.<br>
In the step c), in the case of forming by pressing, a specific pressure of 400 to<br>
800 kg/cm2 is appropriate. Pressing is preferably effected uniaxially or isostatically, for<br>
example by means of a hydraulic press. It may advantageously be preceded by an<br>
operation of manual or pneumatic ramming and/or of vibration.<br><br>
The drying of the step e) may be effected at a moderately high temperature. It is<br>
preferably effected at a temperature from 110°C to 200°C. It conventionally takes from ten<br>
hours to one week, depending on the format of the preform, continuing until the residual<br>
moisture content of the preform is less than O.5%.<br>
The dried preform is then fired (step f)). The firing time, from approximately<br>
three days to approximately 15 days from cold to cold, varies as a function of the materials<br>
but also as a function of the size and the shape of the parts. The firing cycle is preferably<br>
effected in the conventional manner, in air, at a temperature from 1300°C to 1600°C.<br>
Surprisingly, the fashioned refractory product obtained at the end of the step f)<br>
has proved particularly resistant to the stresses encountered inside gasifier reactors, in<br>
particular to infiltration by fused ash or slag.<br>
To fabricate a prefabricated block, the process steps a) to e) described above are<br>
used, but at least part of the firing step f) is effected after assembling the blocks in the<br>
reactor.<br>
The blocks are assembled by means of appropriate expansion joints, using<br>
techniques well known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
The following examples provide a non-exhaustive illustration of the invention.<br>
The following raw materials were used for these examples:<br>
-	particulate mixture of chromium oxide, with a purity of 98% Cr2O3 by weight,<br>
and consisting of at least 90% by weight of particles having a size greater than 20 microns<br>
but less than 20 mm,<br>
-	pigmentary chromium oxide powder (&gt;98% of Cr2O3) whose median diameter<br>
(D50) is less than 2 microns,<br>
-	calcined or micronized alumina powder with a median diameter of 5 microns,<br>
-	monoclinic zirconia powder from ZIRPRO having the characteristics set out in<br>
table 1 below (powder P1),<br><br>
-	additives: magnesium or calcium stearates, temporary binders (derivatives of<br>
cellulose or lignone), chemical binders (phosphoric acid, derivatives of aluminum<br>
monophosphate),<br>
-	stabilized zirconia powder from UNITEC, with the characteristics set out in<br>
table 1 below (powder P2),<br>
clay with a content of alumina &gt;30%.<br><br>
In a first step a), the raw materials were mixed and 3% water added. This was<br>
followed by the process steps:<br>
b)	forming the charge in a mold,<br>
c)	compacting the charge in the mold at a pressure of 600 kg/cm2 to form a<br>
preform,<br>
d)	removing the preform from the mold,<br>
e)	drying the preform, in air, to obtain a residual moisture content of the material<br>
less than or equal to 0.5%,<br>
f)	firing said preform in an oxidizing atmosphere at a temperature from 1400°C to<br>
1600°C to form a fashioned refractory product.<br>
The contents of aluminµm, chromiµm, silicon and calcium oxides in the sintered<br>
final product were calculated from the chemical composition of the raw materials used for<br>
the starting charge.<br><br>
Observation of the microstructure of the products of the invention shows that they<br>
consist of a granulate of chromium oxide surrounded by a binder matrix that contains, for<br>
the products 2 to 5, grains of ZrO2-CaO. Microprobe analysis identifies the content of the<br>
elements of the grains of ZrO2-CaO coming from the powder P1 or P2.<br>
The density and open porosity were measured on the products before any<br>
corrosion had occurred and in accordance with the standard ISO 5017.<br>
Further measurements were effected on products subjected, after the step f), to<br>
corrosion representative of the service conditions suffered by the hot face of gasifier<br>
linings. This corrosion was obtained in the following manner. Samples of the product to be<br>
tested with a size of 25 x 25 x 180 mm3 placed in a furnace crucible were immersed in<br>
fused slag at a temperature of 1600°C for four hours in an argon atmosphere. The samples<br>
were rotated at a speed of 2 rpm.<br>
The slag used contained in particular:<br>
SiO2: approximately 30-50%<br>
A12O3: approximately 10-20%<br>
Fe2O3orFeO: 15-25%<br>
CaO: approximately 10-20%<br>
The base index B of this slag, i.e. the (CaO + MgO + Fe2O3) / (SiO2 + A12O3)<br>
mass ratio, was typically of the order of O.6. The CaO/SiO2 mass ratio was of the order of<br>
O.4.<br>
The following were evaluated: corrosion indicator, depth of penetration of the<br>
CaO of the slag, zirconia depletion, and value of residual modulus of rupture in bending<br>
after a thermal shock test.<br>
The corrosion indicator is equal to the following ratio:<br>
100 x loss of section of the sample of the product tested at the atmosphere / slag triple point<br>
loss of section of the reference sample at the atmosphere / slag triple point<br>
the loss of section resulting from the corrosive attack by the slag described above and from<br>
the resulting dissolution of the refractory product.<br><br>
The corrosion indicator is therefore 100 for the reference product and a value<br>
lower than 100 indicates better corrosion resistance than the reference product.<br>
The depth of penetration of the CaO of the slag was measured by means of a<br>
microprobe on a metallographic section.<br>
The maximum depth to which the zirconia constituting the refractory had been<br>
attacked and dissolved by the slag was measured by means of a microprobe. This depth is<br>
referred to as "depletion".<br>
As the lining of the invention may be subjected in service to high stresses<br>
following thermal shocks, the inventors also measured the change in the modulus of<br>
rupture in bending of the products subjected to a thermal shock.<br>
The residual modulus of rupture in bending after a thermal shock test was<br>
evaluated in accordance with the standard ISO 5014. It is listed as "Residual MOR" in<br>
table 2.<br>
The table 2 below summarizes the results obtained.<br><br><br><br>
Composition No. 1 is the reference composition.<br>
Table 2 indicates that:<br>
o The addition of stabilized zirconia containing CaO (compositions 2-3-4-5-6)<br>
reduces the depletion of zirconia, i.e. attacking of the zirconia by the slag.<br>
o The presence of more than O.5% silicon oxide is not harmful to corrosion<br>
resistance.<br>
o The presence of aluminum oxide may be favorable to resistance to calcium<br>
oxide infiltration, as is indicated by comparing compositions 2 and 3.<br>
o The calcium oxide added in particular by the source of the zirconia is not<br>
particularly harmful to the required properties.<br>
o The products of the invention have better corrosion resistance than the<br>
reference product.<br>
o Composition 3 offers the best compromise for the required properties and is<br>
preferred over all the others.<br>
As is now clear, the lining of the invention advantageously reduces infiltration<br>
and attack by the slags encountered in gasifier reactors, without other functional properties<br>
thereof being degraded.<br>
Of course, the present invention is not limited to the embodiments described,<br>
which are given by way of illustrative and non-limiting example.<br><br>

stabilized in the cubic and/or quadratic form.<br>
2.	The refractory lining as claimed in claim 1, wherein at least 60% of said<br>
zirconium oxide is stabilized in the cubic and/or quadratic form.<br>
3.	The refractory lining as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein it contains at<br>
least one dopant, stabilizing or not stabilizing the zirconium oxide, selected from CaO,<br>
MgO, Y2O3 and TiO2.<br>
4.	The refractory lining as claimed in claim 3, wherein the dopant is CaO.<br>
5.	The refractory lining as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the content<br>
of zirconium oxide (ZrO2) is greater than 6% by weight and/or less than 7% by weight.<br>
6.	The refractory lining as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the content<br>
of chromium oxide (Cr2O3) is greater than 80% by weight.<br>
7.	The refractory lining as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein it has an<br>
aluminum oxide (Al2O3) content greater than 1% by weight and/or less than 10% by<br>
weight and/or a silica content greater than O.5% by weight and/or less than 3% by weight.<br>
8.	The refractory lining as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the structure<br>
of said material features a granulate of chromium oxide bound by a matrix comprising<br>
grains including zirconium oxide and a dopant selected from CaO, MgO, Y2O3 and TiO2,<br>
said dopant stabilizing or not stabilizing said zirconium oxide, the percentage of<br>
zirconium oxide contained in said grains being greater than 2.5% by weight relative to<br>
the weight of said material.<br>
9.	The refractory lining as claimed in claim 8, wherein the dopant content in<br>
said grains is from 1% to 8% by weight relative to the weight of said grains.<br><br>
1O. The refractory lining as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the<br>
material takes the form of a layer applied to the interior wall (26) of a reactor (14) of said<br>
gasifier or of an assembly of blocks arranged to protect said wall (26).<br><br><br>
ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE<br><br>
GASIFIER REACTOR INTERNAL LINING<br>
