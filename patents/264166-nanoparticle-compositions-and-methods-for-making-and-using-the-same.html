invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangement of<br>
components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the following drawings.<br>
The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or of being carried out<br>
in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology used<br>
herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.<br>
[0019]    Any numerical range recited herein includes all values from the lower value to the<br>
upper value. For example, if a concentration range is stated as 1% to 50%, it is intended that<br>
values such as 2% to 40%, 10% to 30%, or 1% to 3%, etc., are expressly enumerated in this<br>
specification. These are only examples of what is specifically intended, and all possible<br>
combinations of numerical values between and including the lowest value and the highest<br>
value enumerated are to be considered to be expressly stated in this application.<br>
[0020]   Herein described are compositions and methods for making compositions<br>
comprising solid lubricant nanoparticles and an organic medium. Also described are<br>
nanoparticles comprising layered materials. The nanoparticles may be solid lubricant<br>
nanoparticles. The nanoparticles may be made from starting materials or solid lubricant<br>
starting materials. Examples of solid lubricants may include, but are not limited to, layered<br>
materials, suitably chalcogenides, more suitably, molybdenum disulphide, tungsten<br>
disulphide, or a combination thereof. Another suitable layered material is graphite or<br>
intercalated graphite. Other solid lubricants that may be used alone or in combination with<br>
the layered materials are polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon®), boron nitride (suitably hexagonal<br>
boron nitride), soft metals (such as silver, lead, nickel, copper), cerium fluoride, zinc oxide,<br>
silver sulfate, cadmium iodide, lead iodide, barium fluoride, tin sulfide, zinc phosphate, zinc<br>
sulfide, mica, boron nitrate, borax, fluorinated carbon, zinc phosphide:, boron, or a<br>

0.05 to about 1.2. Such a material is produced by Allied Chemical under the trade name<br>
Accufluor.<br><br>
[00211    The methods may include milling a solid lubricant feed. In one embodiment, the<br>
solid lubricant feed may be capable of being milled to particles comprising an average<br>
dimension of about 500 nanometers (submicron size) to about 10 nanometers. Suitably, the<br>
particles may have an average particle dimension of less than or equal to about 500<br>
nanometers, suitably less than or equal to about 100 nanometers, suitably less than or equal to<br>
about 80 nanometers, and more suitably less than or equal to about 50 nanometers.<br>
Alternatively, the ball milling may result in milled solid lubricant particles comprising a<br>
mixture, the mixture comprising particles having an average particle dimension of less than<br>
or equal to about 500 nanometers, plus larger particles. Milling may include, among other<br>
things, ball milling and chemo mechanical milling. Examples of ball milling may include dry<br>
ball milling, wet ball milling, and combinations thereof. Ball milling may refer to an<br>
impaction process that may include two interacting objects where one object may be a ball, a<br>
rod, 4 pointed pins (jack shape), or other shapes. Chemo mechanical milling may refer to an<br>
impaction process that may form a complex between an organic medium and a nanoparticle.<br>
As a result of chemo mechanical milling, the organic medium may coat, encapsulate, or<br>
intercalate the nanoparticles.<br>
[0022]   In another embodiment, the solid lubricant feed may be dry milled and then wet<br>
milled. An emulsifier may be mixed with a base and added to the wet milled particles. Dry<br>
milling may refer to particles that have been milled in the presence of a vacuum, a gas, or a<br>
combination thereof. Wet milling may refer to particles that have been milled in the presence<br>
of a liquid.<br>
[0023]    The solid lubricant nanoparticle composition may further comprise an organic<br>
medium. Examples of organic mediums include, but are not limited to, oil mediums, grease<br>
mediums, alcohol mediums, or combinations thereof. Specific examples of organic mediums<br>
include, but are not limited to, composite oil, canola oil, vegetable oils, soybean oil, corn oil,<br>
ethyl and methyl esters of rapeseed oil, distilled monoglycerides, monoglycerides,<br>
diglycerides, acetic acid esters of monoglycerides, organic acid esters; of monoglycerides,<br>
sorbitan, sorbitan esters of fatty acids, propylene glycol esters of fatty acids, polyglycerol<br>
esters of fatty acids, n-hexadecane, hydrocarbon oils, phospholipids, or a. combination<br>
thereof. Many of these organic media may be environmentally acceptable.<br><br>
[0024]    The composition may contain emulsifiers, surfactants, or dispersants. Examples<br>
of emulsifiers may include, but are not limited to, emulsifiers having a hydrophilic-lipophilic<br>
balance (HLB) from about 2 to about 7; alternatively, a HLB from about 3 to about 5; or<br>
alternatively, a HLB of about 4. Other examples of emulsifiers may include, but are not<br>
limited to, lecithins, soy lecithins, phospholipids lecithins, detergents, distilled<br>
monoglycerides, monoglycerides, diglycerides, acetic acid esters of monoglycerides, organic<br>
acid esters of monoglycerides, sorbitan esters of fatty acids, propylene glycol esters of fatty<br>
acids, polyglycerol esters of fatty acids, compounds containing phosphorous, compounds<br>
containing sulfur, compounds containing nitrogen, or a combination thereof.<br>
[0025]    A method of making a lubricant is described. The composition may be used as an<br>
additive dispersed in a base. Examples of bases may include, but are not limited to, oils,<br>
greases, plastics, gels, sprays, or a combination thereof. Specific examples of bases may<br>
include, but are not limited to, hydrocarbon oils, vegetable oils, com oil, peanut oil, canola<br>
oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, paraffin oils, synthetic oils, petroleum gels, petroleum greases,<br>
hydrocarbon gels, hydrocarbon greases, lithium based greases, fluoroether based greases,<br>
ethylenebistearamide, waxes, silicones, or a combination thereof.<br>
[0026]    Described herein is a method of lubricating or coating an object that is part of an<br>
end application with a composition comprising at least one of solid mbricant nanoparticles<br>
and an organic medium. Further described is a method of lubricating an object by employing<br>
the composition comprising solid lubricant nanoparticles and an organic medium as a<br>
delivery mechanism.<br>
[0027]    Disclosed herein are compositions and methods of preparing nanoparticle based<br>
lubricants that, among various advantages, display enhanced dispersion stability and<br>
resistance to agglomeration. Figure 1 illustrates a method of preparing nanoparticle based<br>
lubricants or compositions. A solid lubricant feed is introduced via line 210 to a ball milling<br>
processor 215. Ball milling is carried out in the processor 215 and the solid lubricant feed is<br>
milled to comprise particles having an average particle dimension of less than or equal to<br>
about 500 nanometers, suitably less than or equal to about 100 nanometers, suitably less than<br>
or equal to about 80 nanometers, and more suitably less than or equal to about 50 nanometers.<br>
Alternatively, the ball milling may result in milled solid lubricant particles comprising a<br>
mixture, the mixture comprising particles having an average particle dimension of less than<br>
or equal to about 500 nanometers, plus larger particles. The ball milling may be high energy<br><br>
ball milling, medium energy ball milling, or combinations thereof. Additionally, in various<br>
embodiments the ball milling may be carried out in a vacuum, in the presence of a gas, in the<br>
presence of a liquid, in the presence of a second solid, or combinations thereof. The<br>
nanoparticle composition may be removed from the processor via line 220. The nanoparticle<br>
composition may be a nanoparticle based lubricant.<br>
[0028]    In alternative embodiments, the ball milling may comprise a first ball milling and<br>
at least one more subsequent ball millings, or ball milling and/or other processing as<br>
appropriate. Suitably, the ball milling may comprise dry milling followed by wet milling.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates a further method 100 of preparing nanoparticle: based lubricants where dry<br>
milling is followed by wet milling. Feed 110 introduces a solid lubricant feed into a ball<br>
milling processor 115 where dry ball milling, such as in a vacuum or in air, reduces the solid<br>
lubricant feed to particles having an average dimension of the size described above. Line 120<br>
carries the dry milled particles to a wet milling processor 125. Via line 160 the dry milled<br>
particles are combined with a composite oil or an organic medium prior to entering the wet<br>
milling processor 125. Alternatively, the organic medium and dry milled particles may be<br>
combined in the wet milling processor 125. In further alternative embodiments (not shown),<br>
the dry milling and wet milling may be carried out in a single processor where the organic<br>
medium is supplied to the single processor for wet milling after initially carrying out dry<br>
milling. In other alternative embodiments, the balls in the ball milling apparatus may be<br>
coated with the organic medium to incorporate the organic medium in the solid lubricant<br>
nanoparticles.<br>
[0029]    After wet milling, line 130 carries the wet milled particles to a container 135,<br>
which may be a sonication device. Alternatively, line 130 may carry a mixture comprising<br>
solid lubricant nanoparticles, organic medium, and a complex comprising the solid lubricant<br>
nanoparticles combined with an organic medium.<br>
[0030]   In another embodiment, prior to introduction of the wet milled particles into the<br>
eontainer 135, abase may be fed to the container 135 via line 150. Alternatively, the base<br>
. may be supplied to the wet milling processor 125 and the mixing, which may include<br>
sonicating, may be carried out in the wet milling processor 125. In such embodiments the<br>
solid lubricant nanoparticle composition may be employed as an additive and dispersed in the<br>
base. A base may be paired with a solid lubricant nanoparticle composition according to the<br>
ability of the base and the solid lubricant nanoparticle composition to blend appropriately. In<br><br>
such cases the solid lubricant nanoparticle composition may enhance performance of the<br>
base.<br>
[0031]    In a further embodiment, an emulsifier may be mixed with the base. Emulsifiers<br>
may further enhance dispersion of the solid lubricant nanoparticle composition in the base.<br>
The emulsifier may be selected to enhance the dispersion stability of a nanoparticle<br>
composition in a base. An emulsifier may also be supplied to the container 135 via line 140.<br>
In many embodiments, the emulsifier and base are combined in the container 135 prior to<br>
introduction of the wet milled particles. Prior mixing of the emulsifier with the base may<br>
enhance dispersion upon addition of complexes of solid lubricant nanoparticles and organic<br>
medium and/or solid lubricant nanoparticles by homogeneously dispersing/dissolving the<br>
complexes/nanoparticles. In some embodiments, the mixing of the emulsifier and base may<br>
comprise sonicating. Alternatively, the emulsifier may be supplied to the wet milling<br>
processor 125 and the mixing, which may include sonicating, may be carried out in the wet<br>
milling processor 125. The lubricant removed from the container 135 via line 120 may be a<br>
blend comprising the wet milled particles, organic medium, and base. The blend may further<br>
comprise an emulsifier. In other alternative embodiments, additives; may be added to the<br>
nanoparticle based lubricant during interaction with a mating surface.<br>
[00321    In a further embodiment, antioxidants or anticorrosion agents may be milled with<br>
the solid lubricant nanoparticles. Examples of antioxidants include, but are not limited to,<br>
hindered phenols, alkylated phenols, alkyl amines, aryl amines, 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-<br>
methylphenol, 4,4'-di-tert-octyldiphenylamine, tert-Butyl hydroquinone, tris(2,4-di-tert-<br>
butylphenyl)phosphate, phosphites, thioesters, or a combination thereof. Examples of<br>
anticorrosion agents include, but are not limited to, alkaline-earth metal<br>
bisalkylphenolsulphonates, dithiophosphates, alkenylsuccinic acid half-amides, or a<br>
combination thereof. In another embodiment, biocidals may be milled with the solid<br>
lubricant nanoparticles. Examples of biocidals may include, but are not limited to, alkyl or<br>
kydroxylamine benzotriazole, an amine salt of a partial alkyl ester of an alkyl, alkenyl<br>
succinic acid, or a combination thereof.<br>
[0033]    In yet another embodiment, further processing of wet milled particles may<br>
comprise removal of oils that are not a part of a complex with the solid lubricant particles.<br>
Such methods may be suitable for applications that benefit from use of dry particles of solid<br>
lubricant, such as coating applications. Oil and/or other liquids can be removed from wet<br><br>
milled particles to produce substantially dry solid lubricant particles and complexes. Such<br>
wet milling followed by drying may produce a solid lubricant with reduced tendency to<br>
agglomerate. In specific embodiments, an agent, such as acetone, can be added that dissolves<br>
oils that are not a part of a complex, followed by a drying process such as supercritical<br>
drying, to produce a substantially dry solid lubricant comprising particles treated by milling<br>
in an organic medium.<br>
[0034]   Ball milling conditions may vary and, in particular, conditions such as<br>
temperature, milling time, and size and materials of the balls and vials may be manipulated.<br>
In various embodiments, ball milling may be carried out from about 12 hours to about 50<br>
hours, suitably from about 36 hours to about 50 hours, suitably from about 40 hours to about<br>
50 hours, and more suitably at about 48 hours. Suitably, ball milling is conducted at room<br>
temperature. The benefits of increasing milling time may comprise at least one of increasing<br>
the time for the organic medium and solid lubricant nanoparticles to interact; and producing<br>
finer sizes, better yield of nanoparticles, more uniform shapes, and more passive surfaces.<br>
An example of ball milling equipment suitable for carrying out the described milling includes<br>
the SPEX CertiPrep model 8000D, along with hardened stainless steel vials and hardened<br>
stainless steel grinding balls, but any type of ball milling apparatus may be used. In one<br>
embodiment, a stress of 600-650 MPa, a load of 14.9 N, and a strain of 10-3-10-4 per sec may<br>
be used.<br>
[0035]    The proportions of the components in a nanoparticle based lubricant may<br>
contribute to performance of the lubricant, such as the lubricant's dispersion stability and<br>
ability to resist agglomeration. In wet milling, suitable ratios of solid lubricant nanoparticles<br>
to organic medium may be about 1 part particles to about 4 parts organic medium by weight,<br>
suitably, about 1 part particles to about 3 parts organic medium by weight, suitably, about 3<br>
parts particles to about 8 parts organic medium by weight, suitably, about 2 parts particles to<br>
about 4 parts organic medium by weight, suitably, about 1 part particles to about 2 parts<br>
organic medium by weight, and suitably, about 1 part particles to about 1.5 parts organic<br>
medium by weight<br><br>
[0036]   Suitable ratios of organic medium to emulsifier in a lubricant including the solid<br>
lubricant nanoparticles may be about 1 part organic medium to less than or equal to about I<br>
part emulsifier, suitably, about 1 part organic medium to about 0.5 parts emulsifier by weight,<br>
or suitably, from about 0.4 to about 1 part emulsifier for about 1 part organic medium by<br>
weight.<br>
[0037]    The amount of solid lubricant nanoparticle composition (by weight) sonicated or<br>
dispersed in the base may be from about 0.25% to about 5%, suitably 0.5% to about 3%,<br>
suitably 0.5% to about 2%, and more suitably 0.75% to about 2%.<br>
[0038]    The amount of emulsifier (by weight) sonicated or dissolved in the base,<br>
depending on the end application, shelf-life, and the like, may be from about 0.5% to about<br>
10%, suitably from about 4% to about 8%, suitably from about 5% to about 6%, and suitably,<br>

[0039]    The solid lubricant nanoparticle composition may be used, without limitation, as<br>
lubricants, coatings, delivery mechanisms, or a combination thereof. The solid lubricant<br>
nanoparticle composition may be used, without limitation, as an additive dispersed in a base<br>
oil. The composition may also be used, without limitation, to lubricate a boundary<br>
lubrication regime. A boundary lubrication regime may be a lubrication regime where the<br>
average oil film thickness may be less than the composite surface roughness and the surface<br>
asperities may come into contact with each other under relative motion. During the relative<br>
motion of two surfaces with lubricants in various applications, three different lubrication<br>
stages may occur, and the boundary lubrication regime may be the most severe condition in<br>
terms of temperature, pressure and speed. Mating parts maybe exposed to severe contact<br>
conditions of high load, low velocity, extreme pressure (for example, 1-2 GPa), and high<br>
local temperature (for example, 150-300 degrees C). The boundary lubrication regime may<br>
also exist under lower pressures and low sliding velocities or high temperatures.  In the<br>
boundary lubrication regime, the mating surfaces may be in direct physical contact. The<br>
composition may further be used, without limitation, as a lubricant or coating in machinery<br>
applications, manufacturing applications, mining applications, aerospace applications,<br>
automotive applications, pharmaceutical applications, medical applications, dental<br>
applications, cosmetic applications, food product applications, nutritional applications, health<br>
related, applications, bio-fuel applications or a combination thereof. Specific examples of<br>
uses in end applications include, without limitation, machine tools, bearings, gears,<br><br>
camshafts, pumps, transmissions, piston rings, engines, power generators, pin-joints,<br>
aerospace systems, mining equipment, manufacturing equipment, or a combination thereof.<br>
Further specific examples of uses may be, without limitation, as an additive in lubricants,<br>
greases, gels, compounded plastic parts, pastes, powders, emulsions, dispersions, or<br>
combinations thereof. The composition may also be used as a lubricant that employs the<br>
solid lubricant nanoparticle composition as a delivery mechanism in pharmaceutical<br>
applications, medical applications, dental applications, cosmetic applications, food product<br>
applications, nutritional applications, health related applications, bio-fuel applications, or a<br>
combination thereof. The various compositions and methods may also be used, without<br>
limitation, in hybrid inorganic-organic materials. Examples of applications using inorganic-<br>
organic materials, include, but are not limited to, optics, electronics, ionics, mechanics,<br>
energy, environment, biology, medicine, smart membranes, separation devices, functional<br>
smart coatings, photovoltaic and fuel cells, photocatalysts, new catalysts, sensors, smart<br>
microelectronics, micro-optical and photonic components and systems for nanophotonics,<br>
innovative cosmetics, intelligent therapeutic vectors that combined targeting, imaging,<br>
therapy, and controlled release of active molecules, and nanoceramic-polymer composites for<br>
the automobile or packaging industries.<br>
[0040J   In some embodiments, the ball milling process may create a close caged dense<br>
oval shaped architecture (similar to a football shape or fullerene type architecture). This may<br>
occur when molybdenum disulphide is milled in a gas or vacuum. Figure 7(A) shows the<br>
close caged, dense oval shaped architecture of molybdenum disulphide nanoparticles that<br>
have been ball milled in air for 48 hours.<br>
[0041]    In other embodiments, the ball milling process may create an open ended oval<br>
shaped architecture (similar to a coconut shape) of molybdenum disulphide nanoparticles<br>
which are intercalated and encapsulated with an organic medium and phospholipids. This<br>
may occur when molybdenum disulphide is milled in a gas or vacuum followed by milling in<br>
an organic medium. Figure 7(B) shows the open ended oval shaped architecture of	<br>
molybdenum disulphide nanoparticles that have been ball milled in air for 48 hours followed<br>
by ball milling in canola oil for 48 hours.<br>
[0042]    As shown in the examples, the tribological performance of the nanoparticle based<br>
lubricant may be improved. The tribological performance may be measured by evaluating<br>
different properties. An anti-wear property may be a lubricating fluid property that has been<br><br>
measured using the industry standard Four-Ball Wear (ASTM D4172) Test. The Four-Ball<br>
Wear Test may evaluate the protection provided by an oil under conditions of pressure and<br>
sliding motion. Placed in a bath of the test lubricant, three fixed steel balls may be put into<br>
contact with a fourth ball of the same grade in rotating contact at preset test conditions.<br>
Lubricant wear protection properties may be measured by comparing the average wear scars<br>
on the three fixed balls. The smaller the average wear scar, the better the protection.<br>
Extreme pressure properties may be lubricating fluid properties that have been measured<br>
using the industry standard Four-Ball Wear (ASTM D2783) Test. This test method may<br>
cover the determination of the load-carrying properties of lubricating fluids. The following<br>
two determinations may be made: 1) load-wear index (formerly Mean-Hertz load) and 2)<br>
weld load (kg). The load-wear index may be the load-carrying property of a lubricant. It<br>
may be an index of the ability of a lubricant to rninirnize wear at applied loads. The weld<br>
load may be the lowest applied load in kilograms at which the rotating ball welds to the three<br>
stationary balls, indicating the extreme pressure level that the lubricants can withstand. The<br>
higher the weld point scores and load wear index values, the better the anti-wear and extreme<br>
pressure properties of a lubricant. The coefficient of friction (COF) may be a lubricating<br>
fluid property that has been measured using the industry standard Four-Ball Wear (ASTM<br>
D4172) Test COF may be a dimensionless scalar value which describes the ratio of the force<br>
of friction between two bodies and the force pressing them together. The coefficient of<br>
friction may depend on the materials used. For example, ice on metal has a low COF, while<br>
rubber on pavement has a high COF. A common way to reduce friction may be by using a<br>
lubricant, such as oil or water, which is placed between two surfaces, often dramatically<br>
lessening the COF.<br>
[0043]    The composition may have a wear scar diameter of about 0.4 mm to about 0.5<br>
mm. The composition may have a COF of about 0.06 to about 0.08. The composition may<br>
have a weld load of about 150 kg to about 350 kg. The composition may have a load wear<br>
index of about 20 to about 40. The values of these tribological properties may change<br>
depending on the amount of solid lubricant nanoparticle composition sonicated or dissolved<br>
in the base.<br><br>
[0044]   Various features and aspects of the invention are set forth in the following<br>
examples, which are intended to be illustrative and not limiting.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1<br>
[0045]   Ball milling was performed in a SPEX 800GD machine using hardened stainless<br>
steel vials and balls. M0S2 (Alfa Aesar, 98% pure, 700 nm average particle size) and canola<br>
oil (Crisco) were used as the starting materials in a ratio of 1 part: MoS2 (10 grams) to 2 parts<br>
canola oil (20 grams). The ball to powder ratio was 2 to 1. In other words, the ball weight in<br>
the container was 2% by weight and the weight of the M0S2 sample was 1% by weight.<br>
M0S2 was ball milled for 48 hours in air followed by milling in canola oil for 48 hrs at room<br>
temperature. The nanoparticles were about 50 nm after ball milling. Table 1 summarizes<br>
milling conditions and resultant particle morphologies. It was observed that there was a<br>
strong effect of milling media on the shape of the ball milled nanoparticles. Dry milling<br>
showed buckling and folding of the planes when the particle size was reduced from micron<br>
size to nanometer size. However, the dry milling condition used here produced micro<br>
clusters embedding several nanoparticles. On the other hand, wet milling showed no<br>
buckling but saw de-agglomeration.<br><br><br><br>
[00461    Figure 3 shows TEM micrographs of the as-available (700 nm), air milled and<br>
hybrid milled (48 hrs in air medium followed by 48 hours in oil medium) M0S2<br>
nanoparticles. Figure 3 (A) represents micron-sized particle chunks of the as-available M0S2<br>
sample off the shelf. These micrographs, particularly Figure 3(B)., represent agglomerates of<br>
lubricant nanoparticles when milled in the air medium. Figure 3(B) clearly demonstrates size<br>
reduction in air milled M0S2. Higher magnification (circular regions) revealed formation of<br>
the disc shaped nanoparticles after milling in the air medium. From Figure 3(C) and 3(D) it<br>
may be concluded that the particle size was reduced to less than 30 nm after milling in air and<br>
hybrid conditions. Regardless of the occasionally observed clusters, the average size of the<br>
clusters is less than or equal to 200 nm.<br>
[0047]    Hybrid milled samples were dispersed in paraffin oil (from Walmart) and<br>
remained suspended without settling. However, the dispersion was not uniform after a few<br>
weeks. To stabilize the dispersion and extend the anti-wear properties, phospholipids were<br>
added. Around 2 % by weight of soy lecithin phospholipids (from American Lecithin) was<br>
added in the base oil.<br>
[0048]    Figures 4 and 5 show the XRD and XPS spectra of MoS2 before and after ball<br>
milling, respectively. XRD spectra revealed no phase change as well as no observable<br>
amorphization in the MoS2 after milling.This observation is consistent with the continuous;<br>
platelets observed throughout the nanoparticle matrix in TEM analysis for milled material.<br>
Broadening of peaks (FWHM) was observed in XRD spectra of MoS2 ball milled in air and<br>
hybrid media, respectively. The peak broadening may be attributed to the reduction in<br>
particle size. The estimated grain size is 6 nm. This follows the theme of ball milling where<br>
clusters consist of grains and sub-grains of the order of 10 nm. XPS analysis was carried out<br>
to study the surface chemistry of the as-available and hybrid milled MoS2 nanoparticles. As<br><br>
shown in Figure 3, a carbon (C) peak observed at 285 eV in the as-available MoS2 sample<br>
shifted to 286.7 eV. Bonding energies of 286 eV and 287.8 eV correspond to C-0 and C=O<br>
bond formation, respectively. The observed binding energy level may demonstrate that a thin<br>
layer containing mixed C-O &amp; C=O chains enfolds the MoS2 particles.<br>
[0049]    Preliminary, tribological tests on the synthesized nanopaiticles were performed on<br>
a four-ball machine by following ASTM 4172. The balls used were made of AISI52100<br>
stainless steel and were highly polished. Four Ball Wear Scar measurements using ASTM<br>
D4172 were made under the following test conditions:<br><br>
Wear scar diameter (WSD, mm) of each stationary ball was quantified in both vertical and<br>
horizontal directions. The average value of WSD from 3 independent tests was reported<br>
within ±0.03 mm accuracy.<br>
[0050]    Four Ball Extreme Pressure measurements using ASTM D2783 were made under<br>
the following test conditions:<br><br>
[0051]   Three different particles (in w/w ratio) were evaluated for their anti-wear<br>
properties as additives in paraffin oil. Figure 6(A) shows the average wear scar<br>
measurements for paraffin oil without a nanoparticle additive, paraffin oil with micron sized<br>
MoS2, paraffin oil with MoS2 that was milled in air for 48 hours, and paraffin oil with MoS2<br><br>
that was milled in air for 48 hours followed by milling in canola oil for 48 hours. Figure<br>
6(B) shows the load wear index for paraffin oil without a nanoparticle additive, paraffin oil<br>
with micron sized MoS2, paraffin oil with MoS2 that was milled in air for 48 hours, and<br>
paraffin oil with MoS2 that was milled in air for 48 hours followed by milling in canola oil<br>
for 48 hours.  Figure 6(C) shows the COF for paraffin oil without a nanoparticle additive,<br>
paraffin oil with micron sized MoS2, paraffin oil with MoS2 that was milled in air for 48<br>
hours, and paraffin oil with MoS2 that was milled in air for 48 hours followed by milling in<br>
canola oil for 48 hours.  Figure 6(D) shows the extreme pressure data for paraffin oil with<br>
micron sized MoS2, paraffin oil with MoS2 that was milled in air for 48 hours, and paraffin<br>
oil with MoS2 that was milled in air for 48 hours followed by milling in canola oil for 48<br>
hours. In each test the nanoparticle additive was present in the amount of 1% by weight.<br>
Test data from nanoparticle composition additive in base oil<br><br><br>
[0052]    The transfer film in the wear scar, studied using energy dispersive x-ray analysis<br>
(EDS), identified the signatures of phosphates in addition to molybdenum and sulphur.<br>
Figure 9(a) depicts the base case of paraffin oil without a nanoparticle additive. Figure 9(b)<br>
depicts paraffin oil with the molybdenum disulphide nanoparticles and the emulsifier. It<br>
shows the early evidences of molybdenum (Mo)-sulphur (S)-phosphorous (P) in the wear<br>
track. Iron (Fe) is seen in Figures 9(a) and 9(b), as it is the material of the balls (52100 steel)<br>
in the four-ball test. The molybdenum and sulphur peaks coincide aad are not distinguishable<br>
because they have the same binding energy. Elemental mapping also showed similar results.<br>
Prophetic Examples:<br>
[0053]    Examples 2-23 are made using a similar method as Example 1, unless specified<br>
otherwise.<br>
Example 2<br>
[0054]   MoS2 (Alfa Aesar, 98% pure, 700 nm average particle size) and canola oil from<br>
ADM are used as me starting materials. The MoS2 powder is ball milled for various time<br>
conditions, variable ball/powder ratios, and under various ambient conditions, starting with<br>
air, canola oil and the subsequent combination of milling in air followed by milling in canola<br>
oil. It is also ball milled in different types of organic media. For example, one organic<br>
medium that is used is canola oil methyl ester. The processing of this will be similar to the<br>
above mentioned example.<br>
[0055]    Different types of ball milling processes can be used. For instance, in the first<br>
step, cryo ball milling in air followed by high temperature ball milling in an organic medium<br>
is used.<br>
[0056]    After the ball milling, the active EP-EA (extreme pressure - environmentally<br>
acceptable) particles are treated with, phospholipids that have been mixed with a base oil such<br>
as paraffin oil.<br><br>
