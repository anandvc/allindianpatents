				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a system for controlling a rotatable device. More specifically, the invention relates to motors which are used for generating a torque and generators which are used for generating electricity.<br>
background of   the  Invention<br>
A  typical   electric motor  consists  of  a  stator  and rotor.<br>
The   operation  of   an  electric motor  is based  on the principal   that  an  electric  current  through a conductor produces   a magnetic  field,    the direction of   current   in  an electromagnetic   such as   a  coil of wire determines the location  of   the  magnets  poles  and  like magnetic poles   repel and opposite  poles  attract.<br>
The   stator which  is  typically called the  field structure   establishes a constant magnetic  field in the motor.<br>
Typically the magnetic   field is  established by   . permanent  magnets which  are  called field magnets and located at  equally spaced intervals around the rotor.<br>
The  rotor or armature typically consists of  a series of   equally spaced coils which are able to be energised  to produce a magnetic  field and thus north or south poles.<br>
By keeping the  coils energised the interacting magnetic   fields  of the rotor and the stator produce rotation  of  the  rotor.<br>
To  ensure that  rotation occurs  in a single direction  a commutator  is  typically connected to the windings  of  the  coils of  the rotor so as to change the direction of   the  current  applied to the coils.<br>
If   the direction of the current was not reversed the rotor would rotate  in one direction and then reverse its direction before a  full  cycle of rotation could be completed.<br>
The  above description typifies  a  DC motor.     AC motors  do  not   have  commutators because alternating current<br>
reverses its direction independently.<br>
For a typical AC motor such as an induction motor the rotor has no direct connection to the external source of electricity.  Alternating current flows around field coils in the stator and produces a rotating magnetic field. This rotating magnetic field induces an electric current in the rotor resulting in another magnetic field.<br>
This induced magnetic field from the rotor<br>
interacts with the magnetic field from the stator causing the rotor to turn.<br>
An electric generator is effectively the reverse of an electric motor. Instead of supplying electricity to coils of either the stator or rotor, the rotor or armature is rotated by physical forces produced by a prime mover.<br>
In effect a generator changes mechanical energy into electrical energy. Summary of the Invention<br>

As shown in Figure 4a according to the first embodiment of the invention a system is provided consisting of a rotor 11 having four permanent magnets Ml, M2, M3, M4 which are evenly spaced at 90° with respect to each other.<br>
The system includes a stator 12 consisting of three electro-magnet energising coils A, B, C which are<br>
spaced 120° apart from each other.<br>
Each coil A, B, C is connected in circuit with a power supply of 54 volts and a switch RSI, RS2, RS3 .<br>
Each of the contacts RSI, RS2, RS3 are part of a rotary switch 13 having contacts 14, 15, 16, 17 which are spaced apart at 90" with respect to an adjacent contact.<br>
The rotary switch 13 is provided with contact brushes 18, 19 and is mounted on an axle 20 which is the same or common with the axle of the rotor 11.<br>
Each of the contacts 14, 15, 16, 17 is specially configured with a trapezoidal shape, with the two non-parallel sides consisting of a straight side 21, and a tapered side 22 which tapers outwardly from top side 23 to bottom side 24.<br>
The result is that each contact increases in width moving from the top side to the bottom .side 24.<br>
The brush 18 is able to be moved vertically relative to the contacts 14, 15, 16, 17 while the brush 19 is in constant contact with, the base.<br>
Although Figure 1 only shows the rotary switch 13 having a single series of four contacts 14, 15, 16, 17, for the three coil stator shown in Figure 4a there would in fact be preferably three contact discs on the axle 20.<br>
Each contact disc would have contacts for a<br>
respective one of the coils A, B, C, but each brush for the other discs would be offset by 30° and 60° respectively.<br>
'      A description of the operation of the system shown in Figures 1 to 4a will now be set forth below.<br>
If it is assumed that the magnets Ml, M2, M3, M4 are initially aligned as shown in Figure 4a with magnet Ml opposite one end of coil A, coil A is energised whenever one of the magnets Ml to M4 is aligned opposite it and for a predetermined time after the permanent magnet has passed it.<br>
As shown in Figure 6 coil A is energised by<br>
contact RSI providing an electrical connection through the rotary switch 13.<br>
This occurs by one of the contacts 14 to 17 being aligned in contact with brush 18.  At this time current is applied from the power source VA and continues to be applied until the brush 18 is no longer in contact with one of the contacts 14 to 17.<br>
For.the three coil/four pole arrangement of the first embodiment it is preferred that the brushes are moved to a vertical position where the width of each contact is sufficient for each of the switches RSI, RS2 and RS3 to be closed for 12° 51', 50 " of the rotation of the rotor 11. After this time the switches RSI to RS3 are open and no more current is delivered to any one of the colls A to C.<br>
When the current to each of the coils is switched off a<br>
i<br>
back EMF is induced in each of the coils A to C and this back EMF represented by item Z results in current being maintained in each of the coils for an additional small period of time after the contacts RSI to RS3- are opened.<br>
By switching the coils A to C in the above manner the rotor 11 can be induced to rotate with a lower amount of input current to the stator than would be required if current was delivered constantly to the coils A to C.<br>
Table 1 below shows the resultant force on the rotor 13 for angular positions of the magnets Ml to M4 for angular displacements of magnet from 5° to 30°.<br>
TABLE 1<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
As shown when the magnets of the rotor 13 are rotated 5° at a time the resultant force on the rotor changes from a counter clockwise force from 5° to 15° to a<br>
clockwise force from 15' to 30".<br>
At 0", 15" and 30' the resultant force on the rotor is 0 so that if the permanent magnets of the rotor were aligned in any of these orientations there would be no resultant force to urge the rotor either clockwise or anti clockwise.<br>
As shown in Figure 5 a plot of magnitude of resultant force applied to the rotor against angular displacement of the rotor shows a sinusoidal curve having a cycle of 30°.<br>
For a full 360° rotation of the rotor the rotor would experience 12 cycles of variation in resultant force.<br>
What Table 1 and Figure 5 shows is that unless an additional force is applied to rotate the rotor clockwise or anticlockwise the rotor will not be able to spin continuously in either direction.<br>
If it is assumed that it is desired to rotate the rotor clockwise, then the force must overcome the counterclockwise resultant force which occurs from 0 to 15°, 30° to 45°, 60° to 75° etc through the whole 360° rotation of the rotor.<br>
Because each of the coils A to C has an iron core even when the coils are unenergised the natural magnetic attraction occurring between each magnet and the iron cores results in each magnet Ml to M4 attempting to move in a direction to the closest iron core.<br>
Whenever a magnet is opposite an iron core the magnetic attraction is greatest and there is no force applied by that magnet to move the rotor either clockwise or counterclockwise.  Likewise when a magnet is positioned midway between adjacent iron cores, there is also a resultant force of 0 which translates to no resultant force being applied to the rotor to rotate it in either direction by that magnet.<br>
As shown in Figure 5 and Table 1 if magnet Ml is moved clockwise 5° there is a natural attraction between the magnet Ml and iron core of coil A to pull the magnet Ml in a counter clockwise direction.  If the resultant forces<br><br>
applied by the other magnets were sufficient to overcome the attraction between permanent magnet Ml and the iron core of coil A the rotor would still manage to move<br>
I<br>
clockwise.<br>
However as shown in'Table 1 the angular position of the other magnets M2 to M4 results in an overall counter clockwise resultant force.<br>
To overcome the resultant force it is necessary to produce a pole X at coil A of like polarity to magnet Ml and thus repel Ml away from coil A.<br>
As shown in Figure 5 the strength of the magnetic repelling action between coil A and Ml must be sufficient to overcome the resultant force urging the rotor counter clockwise.<br>
A current could be applied to the coil A for an angular displacement of 15° of magnet Ml, but it is preferred that coil A be energised only for 12°, 51', 50" angular displacement of magnet Ml.  By applying current to coil A for this period of angular displacement a minimum amount of current is applied to coil A in order to overcome the resultant force counter clockwise which occurs for 0° to 15° of angular displacement of magnet Ml.<br>
Although current to coil A can be applied for longer than this period it has been discovered that by applying current for this period a back EMF is induced in coil A which adds to the repulsive force applied to magnet Ml by coil A.<br>
Every time one of the magnets Ml to M4 is aligned at 0° .with coil A coil A is energised for 12°, 51', 50" of angular displacement of that magnet.  Thus as shown in Figure 6 current ends up being applied to coil A at 0° to 12°, 51', 50", 90° to 102°, 51', 50", 180° to 192°, 51', 50" and 270° to 282°, 51', 50".<br>
A similar switching pattern is applied to coils B and C.  For example coil B is energised when magnet M2 has moved 30" to when it has moved 42°, 51', 50" and likewise coil C is energised when magnet M3 has moved 60° to 72°,<br><br>
51', 50".<br>
It is preferred that the rotor has a diameter of 230mm and that each coil has a resistance of 6.8ohms.<br>
Figure 7 shows a graphical representation of input voltage versus input current for a coil resistance of 6.8ohms and for a four pole rotor which is 230mm in diameter.<br>
The exact timing sequence for switching coils on and off will vary depending on the parameters of the rotary device and the controller.<br>
Accordingly by varying the input voltage, coil resistance and overall impedance of the input circuit for each coil the duration during which a coil must be turned on will change.<br>
In fact there are many factors which can change the timing sequence of switching on the coils and some of these are summarised below. The Stator<br>
The variables include the choice of material used in constructing the stator iron core, the number of stator iron cores and their positioning as well as the physical size, section area and shape of the stator iron cores. Rotor<br>
The physical size and magnetic strength and shape of the polarised permanent magnetic body as contained in the rotor, the number of polarised permanent magnetised bodies being contained in the rotor, the positioning and spacing of the same, the use of all like polarities of permanent magnetic bodies or the use of alternating polarities for the permanent magnetic bodies. Stator Coil<br>
The physical size of the coils being positioned onto the stator iron core(s), the type of wire used to wind the coil(s) such as copper, silver, aluminum or others. The shape and section areas of the winding wire, such as round, square, triangular, rectangular and others; the number of turns and layers wound onto the coil and<br>
consequent, ohms resistance; the method of winding onto a coil holder, single winding, double winding, double winding same direction, double winding opposite direction, left to right or vice versa, interwoven winding, whether the above examples would be wound onto.a single coil holder. Speed of Rotor<br>
This can be controlled by the length of the directed (input) DC current (on and cut off period) and/or the control of the supply voltage used to supply the stator coil(s).<br>
Other variations that may be made to the system include the following:<br>
a.	The coils can be connected in series, parallel,<br>
or series parallel.<br>
b.	It is only when the north/south arrangements of<br>
the permanent magnets are used in the rotor that even<br>
numbers of permanent magnets are necessary, but not<br>
necessarily even numbers of pairs of stator coils<br>
positioned in the stator.  Furthermore the direction<br>
DC current supplied to the stator coils in the north<br>
south arrangement above must be synchronised/ meaning<br>
that the magnetic field as needed in the stator<br>
coil(s) must be of corresponding polarity to the<br>
stator coil(s), iron core end, which faces the<br>
permanent magnets.<br>
c.	When using permanent magnets which are all of the<br>
same polarity, then any number of permanent magnets in<br>
the rotor may be used providing there is sufficient<br>
room to contain them at even spacings on the rotor.<br>
d.	The spacings between the permanent magnets must<br>
be exact, if too close to each other the directed DC<br>
current will become less effective, if too far apart<br>
the full potential will not be obtained.<br>
e.	It is possible to have various combinations of<br>
permanent magnet and stator coil iron cores similar<br>
but not restricted to the following:<br>
i.   Three magnets in the rotor, one to<br>
three stator coils can be used.<br>
ii.  Five permanent magnets in the rotor, one to five stator coils can be used.<br>
iii. Nine permanent magnets in the rotor one to three or nine stator coils can be used.<br>
iv.  The output varies with each combination.<br>
v.   Regardless of the rotor containing even or uneven numbers of permanent magnets the stator can operate with only one stator coil and stator iron core and still be highly efficient but with reduced total output.<br>
f. The stator and rotor should be. made from non magnetic materials like wood, plastic, bronze and similar non-magnetic materials.<br>
Although switching is performed in its preferred form by a mechanical rotary switch, it can also be performed by solid state electronics or other switching devices.<br>
The length of the on period for each coil is the physical' length ratio.  When the brushes are in contact with the conductive part of the rotary switch and the non-conductive part.<br>
This ratio is referred as the frequency or number of ratios in one second.<br>
The output produced by the rotary device can be mechanical and electrical at the same time or may be mainly electrical or mainly mechanical.  The reason for this will be explained with reference to the second embodiment in which it is assumed the stator has a single energising coil with an iron core and the rotor has a single permanent magnet.<br>
When the rotors permanent magnet is rotated very slowly by hand in the clockwise direction it is possible to determine the point where the natural magnetic attraction between the rotors permanent magnet and the stators iron core occurs.<br>
When the leading edge of the permanent magnet has<br>
reached point A as shown in Figure 8, the natural magnetic attraction begins and increases exponentially until the centre of the permanent magnet is aligned at point B opposite the iron core 30.<br>
If the permanent magnet 'is rotated away from point B the NMA will be at a maximum point at point B and then decrease from maximum exponentially until the trailing edge of the permanent magnet has reached point C and then ceases.<br>
When the rotor is moved clockwise at a constant speed and an oscilloscope is connected to the stator coil it is possible to observe the movement of the permanent magnetic between point A and point B and then between point B and C as shown in Figure 9.<br>
An induced induction curve is then apparent on the oscilloscope and this induced induction produces a sine wave curve 31.  Furthermore the induced induction between point A to point B is a negative going induced induction in this instance and the induced induction between point B and point C is a positive going induced induction in this instant.<br>
It is also noted that the negative going and positive going induced induction curves are exactly the same but opposite to each other.<br>
When the permanent magnet begins to induce a negative going induction in the stator coil at 0° of the sine wave curve 31, the induction induced is then at 0.  At 90° degrees of the sine wave curve the induced induction is at a maximum and then goes back to 0 when the permanent magnet is aligned with point B/ or at 180° of the sine wave curve, when the permanent magnet starts to move away from its alignment with point B or is at 180° of the sine wave curve.<br>
When the permanent magnets start to move away from its alignment with point B and is moving towards point C the now positive going induced induction is first at 0 at 180° of the sine wave curve, then at a maximum of 270° of the<br>
sine wave curve and then back to 0 at 360" of the sine wave curve.<br>
It should be noted that 0" and 360° of the sine wave curve are not necessarily the same as point A for 0° and point C for 360° of the sine wave curve.<br>
Points A and C are determined by the strength of the rotors permanent magnet and the section area and/or shape of the stator iron core.<br>
The negative going induced induction between 0° and 180° of the sine wave curve produces an electro-magnetic force in the stator coil and iron core of opposite polarity.<br>
The iron core end facing the rotor is of opposite polarity than the permanent magnet in this instance, as •shown in Figure 10.<br>
The positive going induced induction between 180° and 360° of the sine wave curve produces an electro-magnetic force in the stator coil and iron core of the same polarity in the iron core end facing the rotor, being of the same polarity as the permanent magnet in this instance.<br>
When the permanent magnet reaches point A the natural magnetic attraction between the permanent magnet and the stator iron core is at is minimum and starts to move toward point B.  When the induced induction then also starts to occur at 0° of the sine wave curve, being somewhere between point A and point B, the natural magnetic attraction has already increased.<br>
When the permanent magnet is at 0° of the sine wave curve and is moving towards point B or 180° of the sine wave curve, the negative going induced induction in the stator coil is producing an electro-magnetic force (field) in the stator iron core with the iron core end facing the rotor being of an opposite polarity than the permanent magnet and is at zero effect at 0° of the sine wave curve, than at maximum effect at 90° of the sine wave curve and then back to zero effect at 180° of the sine wave curve.<br>
The permanent magnet is then aligned at point B.<br>
There the magnetic attraction force is proportional with the distance and this increases exponentially when moving from A towards point B.  There the stator iron core is fixed and stationary at point B.  Accordingly it will be the permanent magnet that moves towards point B.<br>
As an example if the stator iron core was also a polarised permanent magnetic body of the same strength but of opposite polarity to the permanent magnet, the magnetic attraction force would be at least four times greater because of the distance factor as explained earlier.<br>
Furthermore, this would also occur because of the doubling of the magnetic force between the magnetic north and south arrangement.  It follows therefore that the magnetic attraction between the permanent magnet and the iron core end facing the rotor increases dramatically'when the induced induction in the stator coil produces an electro-magnetic force of the opposite polarity at the stator iron core end facing the rotor as described above.<br>
The increase follows the sine wave curve starting from 0° to 90° of the sine wave and the above effect decreases form 90° back to 180° of the sine wave curve.<br>
A combination curve of the natural magnetic attraction and the induced induction in the stator coil, producing an electro-magnetic force at the stator iron coil end facing the rotor of opposite polarity 33 is shown in Figure 10 from 0° to 180°.  For 180° to 360° the stator iron coil and rotor of like polarities 34 are shown.<br>
When the permanent magnet is aligned at point B and a direct current is supplied to the stator coil for only a short period starting at point B then the DC current is applied only long enough to overcome the natural magnetic attraction between permanent magnet and the stator's iron core end facing the rotor.  The directed DC current as supplied to the stator coil is producing a like-polarity at the iron core end facing the rotor and thus is repelling the permanent magnet away from point B towards point C.<br>
The natural magnetic attraction has thus changed to<br>
natural magnetic repulsion due to the like-polarity of the stator iron core end facing the rotor.<br>
The length of the "on" period has to be sufficient to overcome the natural magnetic attraction and could be as long as until the trailing edge reaches point C where the natural magnetic attraction ceases.  However there the positive going induced induction in the stator coil as produced by the permanent magnet produces an electromagnetic force in the stator or iron core end facing the rotor/ producing a like polarity as the permanent magnet starting at 180° of the sine wave curve or point B and zero at that instant.  At 270° of the sine wave curve, it is at a maximum and then ends up at zero at 360° of the sine wave curve.  In other words at 270° of the sine wave the force is at maximum repulsion and there is induced induction in the stator coil depending on the speed of the rotor.  The effect of variation on the speed of the rotor is shown by curves 35 in Figure 11.<br>
As shown in Figure 11 regardless of the speed of the rotor the induced induction in the stator coil is at a maximum at 270° of the sine wave curve.<br>
The on period can be brought back to the point where the induced induction is great enough to carry the electromagnetic repulsion through to 360° of the sine wave curve and beyond point C.  Therefore the greater the rotor speed the shorter the on period of the input DC current has to be due to the high induced induction in the stator coil as explained earlier.  When the "on" period is switched off it is called the "cut-off" point.  From the cut-off point to 360° of the sine wave curve the repulsion is produced by back EMF the induced induction in the stator coil as previously explained.<br>
During the on period, the magnetic repulsion force produced between the stator iron core at point B and the permanent magnet can be viewed as a combined repulsion force.  Some of this force is produced by natural magnetic repulsion of the permanent magnet and some by the input DC<br>
current as supplied to the stator coil.  Therefore if the induced magnetic force as produced by the input DC current in the stator coil is made equal to that of the permanent magnet with the same polarity, then half of this repulsion force between the on period and the cut-off point, in this instance, is from the natural magnetic repulsion of the permanent magnet as a reaction to the induced magnetic force as supplied by the input DC current to the stator coil.<br>
The input DC current as supplied to the stator coil produces the magnetic repulsion force and is the only outside input to the overall system for total movement between point A and point C.<br>
The total input can be summarised as:<br>
a.	The combined natural magnetic attraction and the<br>
electro-magnetic force as produced by the induced<br>
induction in the stator coil between point A to point<br>
B.<br>
b.	The combined magnetic repulsion force between the<br>
permanent magnet and the stator iron core facing the<br>
rotor during the on period and the cut-off point.<br>
c.	The electro-magnetic repulsion (see induced<br>
induction as explained earlier) between the cut-off<br>
point and point C.<br>
d.	The electro-magnetic repulsion produced by the<br>
back EMF as represented by shaded portion 36 of Figure<br>
11.<br>
According to another embodiment of the present invention the stator has two coils positioned at 180° with respect to each other and the rotor has three permanent magnets spaced at 120° apart.<br>
As set out in Table 2 below from 0 to 30° the resultant force urges the rotor counter clockwise.  At 30° the resultant force is 0 and from 30° to 90° the resultant force is clockwise.  From 90° to 120° the resultant force is counter clockwise.  This completes a full cycle which is repeated three times throughout a 360° rotation of the<br>
rotor.<br>
TABLE 2<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
With the above configuration of poles and coils if it is desired to move the rotor clockwise, current would need to be supplied to the coils of the stator to overcome the counter clockwise force whenever this is counter clockwise, but as explained previously, current does not need to be supplied to the coil to energise the coil for the full period during which the resultant force is counter clockwise.<br>
For convenience and ease of explanation the above embodiments have been restricted to permanent magnets on the rotor and coils on the stator.  However the basic concept behind the invention does not change if the permanent magnets are replaced by coils which are energised to produce the appropriate magnetic poles.<br>
Similarly for an AC rotary device a rotating magnetic field generated by the stator winding or by the rotor /armature winding could similarly be switched to reduce the amount of current required to maintain rotation of the motor in one direction and to maximise the influence of back EMF on maintaining rotation of the motor in a single direction.<br>
The above principles also apply to generators where coils are energised to produce a magnetic field.  In such a situation the coils are switched on for a time sufficient to maintain rotation in the single direction and to maximise the influence of back EMF which tends to maintain rotation of the rotor/armature in a single direction.<br>
By using the above concept it is possible to produce<br>
an output which can be both mechanical and electrical at the same time.  Current generated in the stator coil windings can be used as an output and likewise the torque generated by the rotor can be used to supply a mechanical output.  Likewise only one O the other form of output may be utilised.<br><br><br>
