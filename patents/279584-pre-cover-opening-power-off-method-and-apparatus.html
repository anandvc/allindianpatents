				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a power-off method and apparatus<br>
for cutting off a power supply for electrical equipments in coal mines and<br>
various flammable and explosive places, and more specifically, relates to a<br>
pre-cover-opening power-off method and apparatus.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The Coal Mines Safety Regulations provide that, "live maintenance<br>
and movement of electrical equipments, cables and wires are prohibited<br>
underground". However, in practical operations, live maintenance<br>
frequently occurs due to a lack of the facilities guarantees, causing<br>
countless coal mine accidents. In order to solve this problem, Chinese<br>
Patent No. 200710010531.9, titled "Integrative Protection Device and<br>
Method for Mineral Grading Lockout Explosion Suppression Vacuum<br>
Electromagnetic Starter", and Chinese Patent No. 200520023343.6, titled<br>
"Power-off Upon Cover-Opening Safety Protector for Explosion-Proof<br>
Electrical Device", have proposed two solutions, but both solutions realize<br>
automatic power-off upon opening a cover, and cannot cut off the power<br>
supply prior to opening a cover.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention intends to provide a pre-cover-opening<br>
power-off method and apparatus, which can send out a signal to a safety<br>
protecting and monitoring unit to cut off the power supply and give out an<br>
alarm before screwing off a screw on a cover plate of an electrical<br>
equipment, to thereby solve the problems as to the accidents of gas<br>
explosion and casualties that are caused by live operation.<br>
The present invention is implemented with the following technical<br>
 <br>
solution:<br>
A pre-cover-opening power-off method, comprising the steps of: (a)<br>
fixing a bolt casing to a bolt, (b) connecting a motion sensor to a safety<br>
protecting and monitoring unit in a wired or wireless manner, (c) activating<br>
the motion sensor to send out a command to permit power delivery for an<br>
electrical equipment to operate, and when the bolt casing is taken off, the<br>
motion sensor is activated to send out a command to cut off a power supply<br>
for the electrical equipment or give out an alarm. The step (a) of fixing the<br>
bolt casing to the bolt is realized in the following manner: operating a key<br>
and a lock core or a fastening screw to enter an annular locking slot of the<br>
bolt with a distance sleeve so as to fix the bolt casing, or fixing the bolt<br>
casing to the bolt through threaded connection, or fixing the bolt casing to<br>
the bolt by pinning, or locking the bolt casing to the bolt. The step (c) of<br>
activating the motion sensor is realized in the following manner: when the<br>
bolt casing is fixed to the bolt, a bolt head or the distance sleeve or an<br>
electrical equipment cover plate is pressed against a motion sensor rod, and<br>
a contact is closed or opened, whereby a signal is sent out to the safety<br>
protecting and monitoring unit; when the bolt casing is taken off, the<br>
motion sensor rod leaves the bolt head or the distance sleeve or the<br>
electrical equipment cover plate, and the contact is opened or closed,<br>
whereby a signal is sent out to the safety protecting and monitoring unit, or<br>
the motion sensor is activated to send out a signal to the safety protecting<br>
and monitoring unit when the key and the lock core are operated.<br>
A pre-cover-opening power-off apparatus with a lock, comprising<br>
an electrical equipment cover plate 1, a bolt casing with a lock 2, a key 3, a<br>
lock core 4, a bolt 5, a motion sensor 9, and a safety protecting and<br>
monitoring unit 10. The electrical equipment cover plate 1 is connected to<br>
the bolt casing with a lock 2 by means of the bolt 5. The key 3 and the lock<br>
core 4 are provided inside a hole on one side of the bolt casing with a lock<br>
2. A locking screw 11 is provided inside a hole on the other side of the bolt<br>
 <br>
casing with a lock 2. The motion sensor 9 with a motion sensor rod 8 is<br>
provided inside a hole in an upper portion of the bolt casing with a lock 2.<br>
The motion sensor 9 is connected to the safety protecting and monitoring<br>
unit 10. A lower end of the motion sensor rod 8 is pressed against a bolt<br>
head of the bolt 5. The bolt 5 is jacketed with a distance sleeve 7. The<br>
distance sleeve 7 is cushioned with a spring washer 6 thereunder. The<br>
distance sleeve 7 is provided with an annular locking slot, and the annular<br>
locking slot is connected to the lock core 4. The bolt casing is a bolt<br>
casing with a lock or a bolt casing without a lock, or a frame or a pin that is<br>
mounted on the bolt and can block the screwing of the bolt.<br>
As compared with the prior art, the present invention has the<br>
following beneficial effects: operators can be effectively prevented from<br>
live operations during equipment overhaul, and before opening the<br>
electrical equipment cover plate, a signal can be sent out to the safety<br>
protecting and monitoring unit, to cut off the power supply and give out an<br>
alarm, thereby realizing pre-cover-opening power-off. The present<br>
invention can be widely applied to electrical equipments at various<br>
flammable and explosive places such as coal mines and flammable and<br>
explosive workshops, for guaranteeing the safety of overhaul operators.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
A detailed description of a pre-cover-opening power-off method is<br>
given below with reference to the four types of pre-cover-opening<br>
power-off apparatuses.<br>
Embodiment 1<br>
Fig. 1 shows a pre-cover-opening power-off apparatus with a lock,<br>
which comprises an electrical equipment cover plate 1, a bolt casing with a<br>
lock 2, a key 3, a lock core 4, a bolt 5, a spring washer 6, a distance sleeve<br>
7, a motion sensor rod 8, a motion sensor 9, a safety protecting and<br>
monitoring unit 10, and a locking screw 11. The electrical equipment cover<br>
plate 1 is connected to the bolt casing with a lock 2 by means of the bolt 5.<br>
The key 3 and the lock core 4 are provided inside a hole on one side of the<br>
bolt casing with a lock 2, and the locking screw 11 is provided inside a hole<br>
on the other side of the bolt casing with a lock 2. The motion sensor 9 with<br>
the motion sensor rod 8 is provided inside a hole in an upper portion of the<br>
bolt casing with a lock 2. The motion sensor 9 is connected to the safety<br>
protecting and monitoring unit 10. A lower end of the motion sensor rod 8<br>
is pressed against a bolt head of the bolt 5. The bolt 5 is jacketed with the<br>
distance sleeve 7. The distance sleeve 7 is cushioned with the spring<br>
washer 6 thereunder. The distance sleeve 7 is provided with an annular<br>
locking slot, and the annular locking slot is connected to the lock core 4.<br>
A pre-cover-opening power-off method comprises the steps of: the<br>
lock core is operated by means of a key to enter the annular locking slot of<br>
the bolt with the distance sleeve, so as to fix the bolt casing to the bolt,<br>
wherein the bolt head is pressed against the motion sensor rod, a normally<br>
closed contact is opened and a normally opened contact is closed, whereby<br>
 <br>
a signal is sent out to the safety protecting and monitoring unit, and the<br>
safety protecting and monitoring unit sends out a command to permit<br>
power delivery for the electrical equipment to operate; when the lock core<br>
is operated by means of the key to exit the annular locking slot of the bolt<br>
with the distance sleeve, the bolt casing is taken off, the bolt head leaves<br>
the motion sensor rod, the normally closed contact is closed and the<br>
normally opened contact is opened, whereby the motion sensor sends out a<br>
signal to the safety protecting and monitoring unit, or alternatively, the bolt<br>
head leaves the motion sensor rod when the key and the lock core are made<br>
to exit, the motion sensor sends out a signal to the safety protecting and<br>
monitoring unit, and the safety protecting and monitoring unit in<br>
communication with the motion sensor sends out a command to cut off a<br>
power supply for the electrical equipment or give out an alarm.<br>
The operation process is described as follows. A screw which was<br>
originally fastened on the electrical equipment cover plate 1 is screwed off<br>
and replaced with a suitably sized bolt 5, and the distance sleeve 7 is<br>
screwed on. Alternatively, it is also possible to make the distance sleeve 7<br>
and the bolt 5 into a bolt assembly with a distance sleeve. The long<br>
fastening bolt with the distance sleeve 7, having been provided with the<br>
spring washer 6, is screwed into the electrical equipment cover plate 1 and<br>
is tightened up. Then, the bolt is covered with the bolt casing with a lock 2.<br>
The lock core 4 is operated by means of the key 3 to enter the annular<br>
locking slot, so as to fix the bolt casing with a lock 2. The bolt head of the<br>
bolt 5 is pressed against the motion sensor rod 8, the normally closed<br>
contact is opened and the normally opened contact is closed, thereby a<br>
signal is sent out, and the safety protecting and monitoring unit sends out a<br>
command to permit power delivery. When the electrical equipment is to be<br>
overhauled, only professional personnel can unlock the lock core 4 with a<br>
specific key 3 and take off the bolt casing with a lock 2, so that the<br>
normally closed contact is closed and the normally opened contact is<br>
 <br>
cover plate 1 leaves the motion sensor rod 8, the normally closed contact is<br>
closed, and a signal is sent to the safety protecting and monitoring unit 10<br>
to cut off the power supply for the switch.<br>
The motion sensor 9 may also be mounted nearby the key 3 and the<br>
lock core 4 inside the bolt casing with a lock 2, so that the motion sensor<br>
rod 8 can contact the key 3 or the lock core 4. When the bolt 5 is covered<br>
with the bolt casing with a lock 2, the lock core 4 is operated by means of<br>
the key 3 and the bolt casing with a lock 2 is locked to the bolt 5. At this<br>
time, the key 3 or the lock core 4 activates the motion sensor rod 8, the<br>
normally closed contact is opened, thereby enabling power delivery; when<br>
the cover is to be opened, the lock core 4 is operated by means of the key 3,<br>
the lock core 4 exits the annular locking slot of the distance sleeve 7, the<br>
bolt casing with a lock may leave the bolt 5, the key 3 or the lock core 4<br>
leaves the motion sensor rod 8, the normally closed contact is closed, and a<br>
signal is sent to the safety protecting and monitoring unit 10 to cut off the<br>
power supply for the switch.<br>
The motion sensor 9 may be a switch or a button, or may be a reed<br>
switch, wherein a magnetic piece is mounted on the head of the bolt 5,<br>
whereby the motion sensor acts upon approaching the bolt head to a certain<br>
distance. The motion sensor 9 may also be a touch motion sensor, and the<br>
motion sensor acts upon contacting the bolt head. The motion sensor 9 may<br>
also be a non-contact motion sensor (such as a Hall element, an<br>
optoelectronic motion sensor, or an inductive motion sensor), and the<br>
motion sensor acts upon approaching the bolt head to a certain distance.<br>
The motion sensor 9 may also be an active element (such as piezoelectric<br>
ceramics element, a pressure sensor, a distance testing sensor, a magnetic<br>
card reader, or a wireless transceiver, etc.), and the motion sensor sends out<br>
a signal upon approaching the bolt head to a certain distance or contacting<br>
the bolt head to reach a certain pressure. The motion sensor 9 may also be a<br>
 <br>
magnetic lock, and when the motion sensor approaches the bolt head, the<br>
lock is unlocked under a magnetic effect on the bolt head and the motion<br>
sensor sends out a signal. The motion sensor may be a switch lock, that is,<br>
an electric signal is sent out when the switch is closed, and another electric<br>
signal is sent out when the lock is unlocked by operating the lock core by<br>
means of a key.<br>
The motion sensor 9 can communicate with the safety protecting<br>
and monitoring unit 10 in the following manners: one is that the motion<br>
sensor 9 acts, for example, the normally closed contact is closed, thereby a<br>
signal is sent out to a mine safety protecting and monitoring unit in a wired<br>
or wireless manner, and the mine safety protecting and monitoring unit<br>
receives the signal, and gives out an alarm display, or sends out a command<br>
to a power supply system to cut off the power supply for the switch;<br>
another is that the motion sensor 9 acts, for example, the normally closed<br>
contact is closed, thereby a signal is sent out to a leakage protection system<br>
in a wired or wireless manner, and the leakage protection system receives a<br>
leakage signal and sends out a command to the power supply system to cut<br>
off the power supply for the switch.<br>
