				<td>FUNGICIDAL COMPOSITIONS<br>
The present invention relates to novel fungicidal compositions suitable for control of diseases caused by phytopathogens, especially phytopathogenic fungi, to a method of controlling diseases on useful plants and to a method of protecting storage goods.<br>
It is known that certain o-cyclopropyl-carboxanilide derivatives have biological activity against phytopathogenic fungi, e.g. known from WO 03/74491. On the other hand various fungicidal compounds of different chemical classes and some mixtures thereof are widely known as plant fungicides for application in various crops of cultivated plants. However, crop tolerance and activity against phytopathogenic fungi do not always satisfy the needs of agricultural practice in many incidents and aspects.<br>
Out of the above-mentioned needs of agricultural practice for increased crop tolerance and/or increased activity against phytopathogenic fungi, there is therefore proposed in accordance with the present invention a novel composition suitable for control of diseases caused by phytopathogens comprising<br>
(A)	a compound of formula I<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
or a tautomer of such a compound;<br>
(B)	a fungicide selected from the group consisting of fludioxonil (368), metalaxyl (516), mefenoxam (517), cyprodinil (208), azoxystrobin (47), tebuconazole (761), difenoconazole (247) and thiabendazole (790); and<br>
(C)	a compound selected from the group consisting of<br>
an azole fungicide; an anilino-pyrimidine fungicide; a strobilurin fungicide; an acylalanine fungicide; a benzimidazole fungicide; a fungicide selected from the group consisting of silthiofam (729), furametpyr (411) and penthiopyrad; and an insecticide selected from the group consisting of abamectin (1), clothianidin (165), cyromazine (209), diafenthiuron (226), diazinon (227), emamectin benzoate (291), fenoxycarb (340), fosthiazate (408), imidacloprid (458), lambda-cyhalothrin (198), lufenuron (490), methidathion (529), methiocarb (530),<br>

(Formula Removed)<br>
<br>
and a compound of formula C-2<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
<br>
wherein (B) and (C) are different compounds.<br>
It has been found that the use of component (B) and component (C) in combination with component (A) surprisingly and substantially enhance the effectiveness of the latter against fungi, and vice versa. Additionally, the method of the invention is effective against a wider spectrum of such fungi that can be combated with the active ingredients of this method, when used solely.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention is a method of controlling diseases on useful plants or on propagation material thereof caused by phytopathogens, which comprises applying to the useful plants, the locus thereof or propagation material thereof a composition according<br>

The term "locus" of a useful plant as used herein is intended to embrace the place on which the useful plants are growing, where the plant propagation materials of the useful plants are sown or where the plant propagation materials of the useful plants will be placed into the soil. An example for such a locus is a field, on which crop plants are growing.<br>
The term "plant propagation material" is understood to denote generative parts of the plant, such as seeds, which can be used for the multiplication of the latter, and vegetative material, such as cuttings or tubers, for example potatoes. There may be mentioned for example seeds (in the strict sense), roots, fruits, tubers, bulbs, rhizomes and parts of plants. Germinated plants and young plants which are to be transplanted after germination or after emergence from the soil, may also be mentioned. These young plants may be protected before transplantation by a total or partial treatment by immersion. Preferably "plant propagation material" is understood to denote seeds.<br>
The compositions of the present invention may also be used in the field of protecting storage goods against attack of fungi. According to the present invention, the term "storage goods" is understood to denote natural substances of vegetable and/or animal origin and their processed forms, which have been taken from the natural life cycle and for which long-term protection is desired. Storage goods of vegetable origin, such as plants or parts thereof, for example stalks, leafs, tubers, seeds, fruits or grains, can be protected in the freshly harvested state or in processed form, such as pre-dried, moistened, comminuted, ground, pressed or roasted. Also falling under the definition of storage goods is timber, whether in the form of crude timber, such as construction timber, electricity pylons and barriers, or in the form of finished articles, such as furniture or objects made from wood. Storage goods of animal origin are hides, leather, furs, hairs and the like. The compositions according the present invention can prevent disadvantageous effects such as decay, discoloration or mold. Preferably "storage goods" is understood to denote natural substances of vegetable origin and/or their processed forms, more preferably fruits and their processed forms, such as pomes, stone fruits, soft fruits and citrus fruits and their processed forms. In another preferred embodiment of the invention "storage goods" is understood to denote wood.<br>
Therefore a further aspect of the present invention is a method of protecting storage goods, which comprises applying to the storage goods a composition according to the invention<br>

These compositions according to the invention can be used for controlling, i. e. containing or destroying, animal pests of the above-mentioned type which occur on useful plants in agriculture, in horticulture and in forests, or on organs of useful plants, such as fruits, flowers, foliage, stalks, tubers or roots, and in some cases even on organs of useful plants which are formed at a later point in time remain protected against these animal pests.<br>
In general, the weight ratio of component (A) to component (B), the weight ratio of component (A) to component (C), and the weight ratio of component (B) to component (C) is from 1000 : 1 to 1 : 1000.<br>
A non-limiting example for such weight ratios is a composition, wherein the weight ratio of the compound of formula (I): fludioxonil: difenoconazole is 10:1 1. In this example the weight ratio of the compound of formula (I): fludioxonil, i.e. (A:B), is 10:1; the weight ratio of the compound of formula (I): difenoconazole, i.e. (A:C), is 10:1; and the weight ratio of fludioxonil : difenoconazole, i.e. (B:C), is 1:1.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, component (C) is a fungicide. In this embodiment of the invention, the weight ratio of (A) to (B), of (A) to (C) and of (B) to (C) is preferably from 100 :<br>
1 to 1 MOO; more preferably from 20 : 1 to 1 : 20; and even more preferably from 10 : 1 to 1<br>
; 10.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, component (C) is an insecticide. In this embodiment of the invention, the weight ratio of (A) to (B), of (A) to (C) and of (B) to (C) is preferably from 400 : 1 to 1 : 400. More preferably, in said embodiment of the invention, the weight ratio of (A) to (B) and of (A) to (C) is from 100 : 1 to 1 : 100 and the weight ratio of (B) to (C) is from 100 : 1 to 1 : 400. Yet more preferably the weight ratio of (A) to (B) is from 20 : 1 to 1 : 20; of<br>
(A)	to (C) is from 20 : 1 to 1 : 100 and of (B) to (C) is from 20 : 1 to 1 : 400. Yet even more<br>
preferably, the weight ratio of (A) to (B) is from 10 : 1 to 1 : 10; of (A) to (C) is from 10 : 1 to<br>
1 : 80 and of (B) to (C) is from 20 : 1 to 1 : 400. In one embodiment of the invention, wherein component (C) is an insecticide, the weight ratio of (A) to (B) is from 10 : 1 to 1 : 5; of (A) to (C) is from 1 : 1 to 1 : 20 and of (B) to (C) is from 1 : 1 to 1 : 100.<br>
It has been found, surprisingly, that certain weight ratios of component (A) to the combination of components (B) and (C) are able to give rise to synergistic activity. Therefore, a further aspect of the invention are compositions, wherein component (A), component (B) and component (C) are present in the composition in amounts producing a synergistic effect. This synergistic activity is apparent from the fact that the fungicidal activity of the composition comprising component (A), component (B) and component (C) is greater than the sum of the fungicidal activities of component (A) and of the combined components<br>
(B)	and (C). This synergistic activity extends the range of action of component (A),<br>
component (B) and component (C) in two ways. Firstly, the rates of application of component<br>
(A), component (B) and component (C) are lowered whilst the action remains equally good,<br>
meaning that the active ingredient mixture still achieves a high degree of phytopathogen<br>
control even where the three individual components have become totally ineffective in such a<br>
low application rate range. Secondly, there is a substantial broadening of the spectrum of<br>
phytopathogens that can be controlled.<br>
However, besides the actual synergistic action with respect to fungicidal activity, the compositions according to the invention can also have further surprising advantageous properties. Examples of such advantageous properties that may be mentioned are: more advantageuos degradability; improved toxicological and/or ecotoxicological behaviour; or improved characteristics of the useful plants including: emergence, crop yields, more developed root system, tillering increase, increase in plant height, bigger leaf blade, less<br>
dead basal leaves, stronger tillers, greener leaf colour, less fertilizers needed, less seeds needed, more productive tillers, earlier flowering, early grain maturity, less plant verse (lodging), increased shoot growth, improved plant vigor, and early germination.<br>
The compositions according to the invention have a systemic action and can be used as foliar, soil and seed treatment fungicides.<br>
With the compositions according to the invention it is possible to inhibit or destroy the phytopathogenic microorganisms which occur in plants or in parts of plants (fruit, blossoms, leaves, stems, tubers, roots) in different useful plants, while at the same time the parts of plants which grow later are also protected from attack by phytopathogenic microorganisms.<br>
The compositions according to the invention can be applied to the phytopathogenic microorganisms, the useful plants, the locus thereof, the propagation material thereof, storage goods or technical materials threatened by microorganism attack.<br>
The compositions according to the invention may be applied before or after infection of the useful plants, the propagation material thereof, storage goods or technical materials by the microorganisms.<br>
The amount of a composition according to the invention to be applied, will depend on various factors, such as the compounds employed; the subject of the treatment, such as, for example plants, soil or seeds; the type of treatment, such as, for example spraying, dusting or seed dressing; the purpose of the treatment, such as, for example prophylactic or therapeutic; the type of fungi to be controlled or the application time.<br>
When applied to the useful plants component (A) is applied at a rate of 5 to 2000 g a.i./ha, particularly 10 to 1000 g a.i./ha, e.g. 50, 75, 100 or 200 g a.i./ha, in association with 1 to 5000 g a.i./ha, particularly 2 to 2000 g a.i./ha, e.g. 100, 250, 500, 800, 1000, 1500 g a.i./ha of component (B) and in association with 1 to 2000 g a.i./ha, particularly 1 to 5000 g a.i./ha, particularly 2 to 2000 g a.i./ha, e.g. 100, 250, 500, 800, 1000, 1500 g a.i./ha of component (C).<br>
In agricultural practice the application rates of the compositions according to the invention depend on the type of effect desired, and typically range from 7 to 12000 g of total composition per hectare, more preferably from 20 to 4000 g ot total composition per hectare.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, component (C) is a fungicide. In this embodiment, when the compositions according to the invention are used for treating seed, rates of 0.5 to 100 g of component (A) per 100 kg of seed, preferably from 2.5 to 40 g per 100 kg of seed, more preferably from 5 to 10 g per 100 kg of seed, and 0.01 to 200 g of component (B) per 100 kg of seed, preferably from 0.1 to 50 g per 100 kg of seed, more preferably from 1 to 20 g per 100 kg of seed, and 0.01 to 200 g of component (C) per 100 kg of seed, preferably from 0.1 to 50 g per 100 kg of seed, more preferably from 1 to 20 g per 100 kg of seed are generally sufficient.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, component (C) is an insecticide. In this embodiment, when the compositions according to the invention are used for treating seed, components (A) and (B) are typically applied in rates as described above, whereas component (C) is applied at rates of 0.01 to 2000 g per 100 kg of seed, preferably from 0.1 to 1000 g per 100 kg of seed, more preferably from 1 to 400 g per 100 kg of seed.<br>
The composition of the invention may be employed in any conventional form, for example in the form of a twin pack, a powder for dry seed treatment (DS), an emulsion for seed treatment (ES), a flowable concentrate for seed treatment (FS), a solution for seed treatment (LS), a water dispersible powder for seed treatment (WS), a capsule suspension for seed treatment (CF), a gel for seed treatment (GF), an emulsion concentrate (EC), a suspension concentrate (SC), a suspo-emulsion (SE), a capsule suspension (CS), a water dispersible granule (WG), an emulsifiable granule (EG), an emulsion, water in oil (EO), an emulsion, oil in water (EW), a micro-emulsion (ME), an oil dispersion (OD), an oil miscible flowable (OF), an oil miscible liquid (OL), a soluble concentrate (SL), an ultra-low volume suspension (SU), an ultra-low volume liquid (UL), a technical concentrate (TK), a dispersible concentrate (DC), a wettable powder (WP) or any technically feasible formulation in combination with agriculturally acceptable adjuvants.<br>
Such compositions may be produced in conventional manner, e.g. by mixing the active ingredients with appropriate inert formulation adjuvants (diluents, solvents, fillers and<br>
optionally other formulating ingredients such as surfactants, biocides, anti-freeze, stickers, thickeners and compounds that provide adjuvancy effects). Also conventional slow release formulations may be employed where long lasting efficacy is intended. Particularly formulations to be applied in spraying forms, such as water dispersible concentrates (e.g. EC, SC, DC, OD, SE, EW, EO and the like), wettable powders and granules, may contain surfactants such as wetting and dispersing agents and other compounds that provide adjuvancy effects, e.g. the condensation product of formaldehyde with naphthalene sulphonate, an alkyiarylsulphonate, a lignin sulphonate, a fatty alkyl sulphate, and ethoxylated alkylphenol and an ethoxylated fatty alcohol.<br>
A seed dressing formulation is applied in a manner known per se to the seeds employing the compositions according to the invention and a diluent in suitable seed dressing formulation form, e.g. as an aqueous suspension or in a dry powder form having good adherence to the seeds. Such seed dressing formulations are known in the art. Seed dressing formulations may contain the single active ingredients or the combination of active ingredients in encapsulated form, e.g. as slow release capsules or microcapsules.<br>
In general, the formulations include from 0.01 to 90% by weight of active agent, from 0 to 20% agriculturally acceptable surfactant and 10 to 99.99% solid or liquid formulation inerts and adjuvant(s), the active agent consisting of at least component (A) together with component (B) together with component (C), and optionally other active agents, particularly microbiocides or conservatives or the like. Concentrated forms of compositions generally contain in between about 2 and 80%, preferably between about 5 and 70% by weight of active agent. Application forms of formulation may for example contain from 0.01 to 20% by weight, preferably from 0.01 to 5% by weight of active agent. Whereas commercial products will preferably be formulated as concentrates, the end user will normally employ diluted formulations.<br>

Bioloqical Examples<br>
In comparison with a two-component mixture of active ingredients, such as, for example<br>
(B+C), the action to be expected (additive action) E for a given active ingredient combination<br>
of three components (A+B+C) can be calculated as follows (COLBY, S.R. "Calculating<br>
synergistic and antagonistic responses of herbicide combination". Weeds, Vol. 15, pages 20-<br>
22, 1967):<br>
ppm = milligrams of active ingredient (= a.i.) per liter of spray mixture<br>
XBc =% action by a mixture (B+C), for example, using p ppm of active ingredient.<br>
Z = % action by active ingredient A) using r ppm of active ingredient.<br>
E = XBC+ [Z (700-*)/100]<br>
Thus, if the observed action for the given combination of three active ingredients (A+B+C) is greater than the action to be expected from the Colby formula, then synergism is present.<br>
The synergistic effect of the compositions of the present invention is demonstrated in the following Examples.<br>
if the action actually observed (O) is greater than the expected action (E), then the action of the combination is super-additive, i.e. there is a synergistic effect. In mathematical terms, synergism corresponds to a positive value for the difference of (O-E). In the case of purely complementary addition of activities (expected activity), said difference (O-E) is zero. A negative value of said difference (O-E) signals a loss of activity compared to the expected activity.<br>
