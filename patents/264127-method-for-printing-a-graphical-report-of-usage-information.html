The printer stores information on how to generate graphs of different types by using a given set of parameters. One-touch functionality is provided for critical report pages. The printer exports the printed pages to a host computer or to a network.<br>
Accordingly, this invention further explains a system for generating graphical report on usage statistics, where the said system comprises:<br>
(a)	an internal static storage that is re-writable for storing device statistics;<br>
(b)	a module that is used for generating the patterns of the graphical reports;<br>
(c)	a Ul to enable the user for selecting the graphical report on the type of graph; and<br>
(d)	a module to generate the geometrical parameters from the selected graph.<br>
In the said system the said graph is a histogram or a Pie chart. The system produces the histograms or Pie charts by taking various combinations of the said set of parameters. The system stores a plurality of usage information in the memory and combine the said information in a user requested manner to produce usage<br><br>
reports. The system stores information on how to generate graphs of different types by using a given set of parameters. One-touch functionality is provided for critical report pages. The system exports the printed pages to a host computer or to a network.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more readily apparent from the detailed description taken in conjunction with the drawings and the claims.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 shows a flow chart of the present invention. Figure 2 shows a block diagram of the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
A Multifunctional peripheral is capable of storing its data on a non-volatile memory like the way many faxes are sent and /received. The data includes information pertaining to the number of documents sent by a particular user/group of users for print in a specified amount of time, the number of errors occurred when a job was being processed etc. To analyze these data, the printer produces the histograms or Pie charts by taking various combinations of the same. For an example, a Graph<br><br>
(Histogram or Pie chart) can be produced based on the usage of a particular resource. It can also combine such data with user information of various kinds. The invention relates to a printer that stores a plurality of usage information in it's memory and then combine them in a user requested manner to produce usage reports. These reports are printed using graphical means and not as text reports. The printer stores information on how to generate graphs of different types by using a given set of parameters. The user is allowed to choose a set of parameters which is used in generating the print of a graphical report. We can provide one-touch functionality for some important report pages.<br>
The following example describes part of the above description,<br>
FAX SENT TO	STATUS	TIME<br>
1233	YES	9.12<br>
1234	NO	9.3<br>
3435	YES	9.4<br>
4343	YES	10<br>
544	NO	10.3<br>
54546	NO	11<br>
45645	NO	11.1<br>
4464	YES	11.2<br>
456456	YES	11.3<br>
456456	YES	11.4<br>
544	YES	12<br>
Then the user can request for a graph, number of faxes successfully sent. He can also request for graph on hour basis verses status.<br>
The method to obtain the graphs, assume that details of the faxes stored in the device non-volatile memory, kind of fields, like fax number, sent status, time of the fax sent, receive number, receive time, receive status, and user information like the sender's details can also be stored in the device non-volatile memory.<br><br>
The user can further request for a graph through operational panel, and then the MFP processes the data and produces the graph.<br>
Figure 1 is the flow chart which illustrates that how it interacts each in the system and below describes the new parts to be added in the existing system to enable the feature:<br>
1.	An internal static storage that is re-writable may be used for storing device statistics.<br>
2.	A new module that is used for generating the patterns of the graphical report.<br>
3.	A Ul to enable the user for selecting the graphical report on the type of graph.<br>
4.	A module to generate the geometrical parameters from the selected graph.<br>
Processing the Data:<br>
The following steps helps in producing the bitmap of the graph and it is a special case for Pie chart, and assumed that similarly it can produce the graph in case of histogram.<br>
Method to Produce the Pie chart:<br>
Allocate the one page of the memory as two dimensional array, and assume the centre (X, Y) of the two dimensional array as centre of the page, and assume that radius of pie chart as R. Compute the 360 values for each degree R COS A and R SIN A, where A=1l2...,360, store them. Assume the X(1), X(2), ..., X(n) are the values to draw the pie chart. X = X(1) + X(2) + ....+ X(n), then find the each sector by computing S(i) = 360/ X * X(i), where i= 1, 2, ... n.<br>
Traverse the page from the left to right, and top to bottom. One can find the sector of the memory by using the (R COS S(i), R SIN S(i)), (X, Y), (RCOS S(i-1), RSIN(i-1)), where i = 1, 2, ..n. Fill the portion by traversing left to right and top to bottom approach by find the values in this sector with appropriate color. Apply the same<br><br>
step to all the sectors with different color.<br>
Assume that each bar of histogram as rectangle and its length is 'A' and height is (B\ Without loss of generality we can assume first bar is at (0, 0), (A, 0), (0, B) and (A, B).<br>
Allocate the one page of the memory as two dimensional array. Traverse the page from the left to right, and top to bottom. One can find all the points which are falling in this region as specified co-ordinates above with the following condition 0
