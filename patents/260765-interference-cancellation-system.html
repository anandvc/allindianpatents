“INTERFERENCE CANCELLATION SYSTEM”<br>
ADAPTIVE SPECTRUM AND SIGNAL ALIGNMENT INCORPORATED;<br>
An American Company of 203 Redwood Shores Parkway, Suite 250, Redwood City, CA 94065-1198 (United States of America)<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
WO 2006/051359<br><br>
PCT/IB2005/002318<br><br>
INTERFERENCE CANCELLATION SYSTEM<br>
        This application is related to United States Serial No. 10/808,771, entitled "HIGH<br>
5     	SPEED MULTIPLE LOOP DSL SYSTEM" and filed March 25, 2004, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
10	This invention relates generally to methods, systems and apparatus for managing<br>
digital communications systems. More specifically, this invention relates to the use of a functional antenna in connection with a DSL modem or the like to reduce the deleterious effects of RF interference, including AM radio noise, on DSL and/or other data signals.<br>
Description of Related Art<br>
15	Digital subscriber line (DSL) technologies provide potentially large bandwidth for<br>
digital communication over existing telephone subscriber lines (referred to as loops and/or the copper plant). Telephone subscriber lines can provide this bandwidth despite their original design for only voice-band analog communication. In particular, asymmetric DSL (ADSL) and very-high-speed DSL (VDSL) can adapt to the<br>
20     characteristics of the subscriber line by using a discrete multitone (DMT) line code that assigns a number of bits to each tone (or sub-carrier), which can be adjusted to channel conditions determined during initialization and subsequent on-line training known as "bit-swapping" of the modems (typically transceivers that function as both transmitters and receivers) at each end of the subscriber line.<br>
25	ADSL service uses frequencies in the range of 138 KHz to 1.1 MHz for operation.<br>
Nearly 5,000 AM radio stations in the United States use frequencies in the range of 540 KHz to 1.7 MHz. These radio signals permeate many areas, including areas in which users have DSL modems in operation. The sizable overlap in frequencies usage can<br>
-2-<br><br>
WO 2006/0513 59	PCT/IB2005/002J18<br>
create problems for DSL users. In addition, other sources of radio frequency (RF) interference can contribute to a deterioration in DSL system performance as a result of the interference they cause. Finally, other types of interference also can interfere with data signals sent on DSL and other communication systems, such as crosstalk, impulse noise <br>
  5      and other man- made electronic radiation.<br>
RF interference does not distort the entire spectrum identified above. Instead, many sources, such as AM radio stations, affect only a very narrow portion of the frequency spec trum. ADSL uses 128 or 256 carriers, each of which is a discrete segment of the frequency spectrum about 43125 kHz wide. Because the ADSL system blocks the<br>
10     transmissions into packets or symbols of information that are 250 microseconds in length, there is a windowing effect that causes the receiver to see RF interference within tens to hundreds of kilohertz of the center of each and every carrier used in the ADSL system. Theoretically, 5 KHz wide RF AM radio interference would tend to affect only 2-3 ADSL carriers, but the windowing effect leads to each AM radio station possibly affecting<br>
15      anywhere from several to tens of carriers.<br>
In many prior systems, the modem affected by RF interference at a given carrier merely stops using the affected carriers or at least reduces the number of bits the modem carries in the vicinity of the RF interference, which lowers the performance of the DSL system. The effect is especially pronounced when the interference is present at the end of<br>
20     a long DSL line. Signals that have been attenuated significantly during transmission can be completely overcome by RF interference at a customer's premises. While twisting of the transmission loop wires mitigates some of the ingress of RF interference, it nevertheless represents a significant problem. As the frequency band used by the DSL system increases (for example, ADSL2+, VDSL), the twisting or balance of the twisted<br>
25     pair becomes less effective so that the higher the frequency of the RF ingress, the larger its coupling into the pairs. Furthermore, higher frequencies on a twisted pair tend to be the most attenuated, and so are more susceptible to distortion by the crosstalk at higher frequencies.<br>
In particular, RF interference often couples most strongly to telephone lines<br><br>
-3-<br><br>
WO 2006/051359	PCT/(B 2005/002318<br>
between customers' premises and pedestals (service terminals) and the like. Pedestals offer a cross-connection point between lines going from a central office (or remote terminal central office) to a specific customer premises or a few customer premises (often referred to as a "drop"). The remainder of lines from the CO may continue to other <br>
 5      	pedestals. Typically, there are 2-6 lines in the "drop" segment to each customer,<br>
providing extra copper for the contingency of one or more customers later demanding multiple phone services. The relatively exposed DSL transmission loop segment running between the pedestal and customer premises acts as an antenna, picking up the RF interference signals, especially the AM radio broadcasts in the area. This segment of the <br>
10     	line may experience vertical runs of the line that tend to act as higher gain antennas to the RF signals. Additionally, this last segment is often not well shielded or employs shields that are not well grounded, leading to additional gain in receipt of RF signals by the telephone line(s).<br>
Systems, methods and techniques that permit improved removal of noise caused <br>
15      	by RF interference would represent a significant advancement in the art.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A DSL or other communication system includes a modem or other communication device having at least one antenna that is configured to collect interference data relating to interference noise affecting communication signals being<br>
20    	 received by the communication device. The interference may include RF interference, such as AM radio interference, crosstalk, impulse noise and other types of man-made electronic radiation and/or interference from various sources. The interference data co 11 collected by the antenna is used by an interference canceller to remove and/or cancel sons or all of the interference affecting received signals. In some embodiments of the<br>
25     	present invention, more than one antenna may be used, wherein each antenna can collect interference data pertaining to a single source of interference noise. Where a modem or other communication device is coupled to multiple telephone lines, only one of which is being used as the active DSL line, wires in the remaining telephone lines or loops can be used as antennas. Moreover, the antenna may be an antenna, per se, such as a compact<br><br>
WO 2006/051359	PCT/IB2005/002318<br>
AM radio antenna or any other suitable structure or device for collecting the type(s) of interference affecting signals received by the communication device.<br>
More specifically, a modem or other communication device can use antenna means to collect interference data relating to interference noise affecting signals received<br>
5      	by the communication device. The antenna means, which may be one or more antennas and/or wires coupled to the communication device, provides the interference data to interference canceling means in the communication device. Such canceling means can include appropriate analog to digital converters, delay blocks or modules, adaptive filters and subtractors for treating received signals and interference data from the one or more<br>
10      antennas. Once the interference noise has been completely or partially removed or<br>
canceled from the received signals, the remaining data can be processed in any suitable way by the communication device.<br>
Where a DSL modem is the communication device, multiple telephone lines or loops may be coupled to the modem, providing extra wires that are part of active or<br>
15      inactive telephone and/or DSL lines. These extra wires can serve as antennas for<br>
collecting RF interference data, crosstalk interference data, etc. Each additional wire can collect interference data from a single interference noise source and provide that interference data to the interference canceller. Wires that are part of a drop segment from a pedestal to a customer's premises equipment can be especially effective antennas<br>
20      because they are generally replicas of the active DSL or other communication line that is part of the same drop segment.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The following detailed description of the invention will refer to one or more embodiments of the invention, but is not limited to such embodiments. Rather, the detailed description is intended only to be illustrative. Those skilled in the art will readily <br>
25      	appreciate that the detailed description given herein with respect to the Figures is<br>
-6-<br><br>
WO 2006/051359	PCT/IB2005/002318<br>
provided for explanatory purposes as the invention extends beyond these limited illustrative and exemplary embodiments.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention provide a modem, or other communication device having data signals susceptible to noise from RF and/or other interference sources<br>
 5       (including, for example, impulse noise, crosstalk and other man-made electronic<br>
radiation), that uses an antenna (or other structure functioning like an antenna) to obtain data relating to RF and/or other interference present in the environment in which the modem and/or any unshielded or poorly shielded portion(s) of the DSL loop operate. In some embodiments, an antenna, per se, is used. In other embodiments, one ore more<br>
10      wires available for other functions also serve as one or more antennas. For example,<br>
when multiple telephone wires are used as part of the drop from a pedestal or other link to a customer premises, wires in unused and/or inactive DSL lines can be used instead as one or more antennas. In some modems, the inactive lines may nevertheless be coupled to the modem as they would be if they were active. The phrases "coupled to" and<br>
15      "connected to" and the like are used herein to describe a connection between two<br>
elements and/or components and are intended to mean coupled either directly together, or indirectly, for example via one or more intervening elements or via a wireless connection, where appropriate.<br>
                    An antenna used in connection with the present invention collects interference <br>
20      data relating to its environment (for example, RF interference from AM radio signals,<br>
crosstalk induced by nearby lines, etc.) and provides that data to an interference canceller or filter that uses the interference data to remove interference noise from DSL or other communication signals. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, when two sources of signal data (for example, user payload data and noise) are transmitted on a <br>
25      	given line, a second line containing one set of that data (for example, the noise alone) allows the removal of that data from the mixed signal. Where user payload data and interference data are present in a given DSL line, the ability to collect the interference data using embodiments of the present invention allows the accurate and relatively complete removal of the interference data, yielding a much more accurate representation<br>
-7-<br><br>
WO 2006/051359	PCT/IB2005/002318<br>
of the user payload data. The removal of the interference data may occur in a receiver, after receipt of the mixed data signal.<br>
The present invention can be used in a variety of locations to remove various types of environmental interference sources. Some embodiments of the present <br>
5     	invention, particularly useful in connection with customer premises and RF interference, especially AM radio interference, are presented herein as examples but are not intended to be limiting in any way. Moreover, while embodiments of the present invention are explained in connection with one ore more types of DSL systems, other communication systems may benefit from the present invention as well and are intended to be covered by<br>
10      the present invention.<br>
The term subscriber loop or "loop" refers to the loop that is formed by the line that connects each subscriber or user to the central office (CO) of a telephone operator (or possibly a remote terminal (RT) of such an operator). A typical topology 100 of a DSL plant is presented in Figure 1. As can be seen, a CO 105 provides high bandwidth<br>
15     transmission via a feeder 110 (which can be a high-bandwidth link, such as fiber optic cable, or a binder with a number of copper lines running through it). The feeder 110 may connect the CO 105 to a serving area interface (SAI) 120 (which may, for example, be an optical networking unit or ONU). From interface 120, a number of copper lines 125 may then extend to a pedestal 130 near one or more customer premises equipment (CPE)<br>
20     locations 140. Such pedestals are common on each block of a street or neighborhood, for example. In some cases, pedestals are intermediate points between a CO, SAI and/or other pedestals. For example, in Figure 1, an inter-pedestal link 128 continues lines that do not divert to the line(s) 135 of a customer 140 on to another pedestal and thus sub sequently to one or more other CPEs.<br>
25	Pedestals offer a cross-connection point between lines going to one or more<br>
customer premises (often referred to as a "drop") and the remaining lines that may continue to other pedestals. Typically, there are 2-6 lines in the "drop" segment to each customer, providing extra copper for the contingency of one or more customers later det sanding multiple phone services. The cable back to the ONU or central office usually<br>
-8-<br><br>
WO 2006/051359	PCT/IB2005/002318<br>
does not have 2-6 times as many phone lines as would be needed by all the customers (because not all customers would have demanded that many phones). However, the pedestal drops typically have extra copper. A customer's modem can be connected to extra lines for a number of reasons (for example, future bonding and/or vectoring of lines<br>
5      	and/or signals, cancellers such as those covered by embodiments of the present invention, selection of a best line by the modem if the lines actually are connected all the way back, etc.) This extra copper may be exploited in some embodiments of the present invention when extra wires and/or lines are used as the antenna(s) for the modem. To further illustrate a generic DSL deployment, Figure 2 shows two sources of data signals 210, 220<br>
10     (for example, DSLAMs and the like) providing services to a number of users/CPEs 291, 292, 293 via a series of feeders and other communication lines 213, 217, 227, 250. In one case, a group of 4 loops 260 are dropped from pedestal 251 to CPE 293. The drop of loops 260 may be unshielded or may be poorly shielded, allowing the ingress of RP interference from any nearby sources (for example, home appliances) and/or strong<br>
15     sources (for example, AM radio).<br>
In addition, crosstalk interference may affect signals on active DSL lines. Crosstalk is a well-known phenomenon in which unwanted interference and/or signal noise passes between adjacent lines that occurs due to coupling between wire pairs when wire pairs in the same or a nearby bundle are used for separate signal transmission. <br>
20     	Embodiments of the present invention can be used to remove one or more significant crosstalkers in a given system, thus improving the transmission of data to a user, even though all crosstalk might not be removed.<br>
A basic modem is shown in Figure 3, incorporating one or more embodiments of the present invention. In the example of Figure 3, the removal of RF interference is used<br>
25     	as an exemplary interference cancellation is performed in the time domain, rather than the frequency domain. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that this facilitates cancellation of the RF interference noise because the RP interference is asynchronous. However, removal can be performed in the frequency domain in some cases, for example by heating successive DFT output block symbols in a receiver, and the invention includes RF<br><br><br>
WO 2006/051359	PCT/IB2005/002318<br>
interference cancellation in all such circumstances. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the type of interference being removed may dictate or otherwise make various options more preferable than others.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates a remote modem, transceiver or other communication device <br>
5      	300 operating in its receiver mode. Communication device 300 of Figure 3 receives transmitted data 390 using an active DSL line 392. The line 392 typically includes at least one segment that is unshielded (or poorly shielded) and thus often highly receptive to RF and other types of interference (depending on various factors known to those skilled in the art, such as the sufficiency of twisting of the wires in line 392). Thus the <br>
10     	transmitted data 390 received by the modem 300 may very well include payload data and RF or other interference noise. The analog signal on line 392 is converted to digital data at converter 322.<br>
Antenna means 394 may be an antenna, per se (such as an AM radio compact antenna or the like), one or more wires in a second or additional telephone/DSL line, or<br>
15     any other suitable device or structure configured to collect interference data relating to at least one type of interference noise affecting signals being received by the modem 300. The interference data collected by the antenna means 394 are provided to interference canceling means 320 in the modem 300. Particular structures for the interference canceling means 320 are disclosed herein, but others will be apparent to those skilled in<br>
20     the art, depending on the type of interference data being collected, the type of<br>
communication signals being received by the modem 300, the processing needed to use the interference data to remove some or all of the interference noise affecting signals received by the modem 300, etc.<br>
In the example system of Figure 3, the analog interference data received by <br>
25     	antenna means 394 is converted from analog to digital form by a converter 322. (As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, all of the processing described as occurring in digital signals may also be done with analog signals from line 392 and antenna 394. ADC 322 can be differentially coupled to a second line or can use a common reference such as one wire from the active line and couple to either of the wires of a second<br>
-10-<br><br>
WO 2006/051359	PCT/IB2005/002J18<br>
telephone line if the antenna is a wire from a second telephone line) The digital signal from antenna 394 is then filtered using an adaptive filter 324 in modem 300. The transmitted data signal may be controlled by a delay block 323 (so that the old RF interference is already in the adaptive canceller and thus renders downstream cancellation<br>
  5      causal - John, I'm just not sure what the wording for this should be.), as will be<br>
appreciated by those skilled in the art. The appropriately conditioned RF interference data and transmitted data signals are then input to a subtractor 325, which can perform a simple subtraction to remove the RF interference noise from the transmitted data. The output of subtractor 325 is used to assist the filter 324 in adapting the signal from antenna<br>
10      394. Embodiments of the present invention might use a digital tapped-delay-line filter whose coefficients are adapted by well-known adaptive algorithms such as the LMS algorithm (perhaps with leakage to allow for the narrow-band input and possible instability). Such filters are well known to those skilled in the art. See, for example, Maurice Betlanger, Adaptive Digital Filters, Marcel Dekker, 2001, New York, Chapters<br>
15      4-7.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention use the RF interference data collected by the antenna 394 to remove noise in the transmitted data 390 that is caused by RF interference in the frequency range used to transmit data downstream to modem 300. In the case of the most common forms of ADSL, for example, this would include RF<br>
20      interference in the range of 138 kHz to 1104 MHz. This naturally would include AM radio interference found in the band of 540 KHz to 1.1 MHz. Some forms of ADSL move the downstream start frequency, which typically is 138 kHz, as low as 0 Hz and as high as 200-300 kHz. Some forms of ADSL, most notably ADSL2+, move the downstream end frequency as high as 2.208 MHz while VDSL may move this frequency<br>
25      to 8.832 MHz, 17.668 MHz or even as high as 30-36 MHz. These extended bands could include AM radio interference found in the band of 540 kHz to 1.6 MHz as well as amateur radio bands at 1.8-2.0 MHz, 3.5-4 MHz, 7.0-7.1 MHz and several others at higher frequencies.<br>
Those skilled in the art also will appreciate that other sources of RF interference<br><br><br>
WO 2006/051359	PCT/IB2005/0023I8<br>
might be present, including but not limited to radio beacons used for navigational purposes, long-wave radios and a variety of other sources. Moreover, noise from a source of another type of noise that is not RF interference noise (for example, crosstalk from a another DSL line) could couple into the active DSL line and the "antenna" line/wire. <br>
5      	Such noise also could be eliminated by the canceller of the present invention, even though the noise might not be described and/or characterized as an RF signal, per se. As mentioned above, the interference noise does not have to be RF noise so long as there is a single source impinging on both the active data line and the antenna. For example, one such alternative noise could be a DSL signal on a separate telephone line that couples into<br>
10      	both the active data line and the antenna used in this invention. The number of antennas must exceed the number of noise sources at any single frequency or tone of a DMT DSL system in order for complete cancellation of any such noise to occur. Thus, if there is one antenna, one independent noise source can be cancelled at each frequency.<br>
Once the RF interference noise has been removed, the data is sent to a discrete <br>
15      	Fourier transform module 326, constellation decoder 328 and tone reordering module 330, all of which are well known to those skilled in the art. Data bound for the interleaved path 342 of a DSL modem is then sent to a de-interleaver 332, descrambler and FEC decoder 336 and interleaved cyclic redundancy code prefix (crci) detector 338. Similarly, data bound for the fast path 344 of modem 300 is sent to descrambler and FEC <br>
20     	decoder 334 and fast cyclic redundancy code prefix (crcf) detector 340. Finally, the data is deframed in module 346 and provided to a user as payload data 396.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the modem is connected to multiple telephone/DSL lines, as shown, for example, in the drop 260 of Figure 2. in such a case, one or more wires of the DSL lines connecting the CPE modem 293 to the <br>
25     	pedestal 251 may be used as an antenna. A more detailed view of such a configuration is shown in Figure 4, in which a modem 400 is connected to pedestal 404 by a multiple loop segment 406 comprised of 8 wires 411 through 418, which are the 8 wires of 4 loops 421, 422,423,424 (similar to loops in segment 260 of Figure 2). In the example of Figure 4, only loop 424 (using wires 417, 418) is active, loops 421, 422, 423 being inactive. Thus<br><br>
WO 2006/051359	PCT/IB2005/002318<br>
wires 411 through 416 are not in use for DSL communication purposes. Instead, at least one of these wires, wire 416, is used as an interference data antenna for modem 400. In this case, wire 416 is practically identical to wires 417, 418 of active loop 424 (for example, being approximately the same length and having the same orientation, possibly <br>
5      	being the same material/type of wire, and possibly having the same amount or absence of shielding). This means that wire 416 will receive practically identical RP and/or other interference signals as those received by loop 424. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, if more than one source of RF and/or other interference (for example, crosstalk from one or more additional DSL lines) is present, additional inactive loops' <br>
10      wires can be used similarly, if desired.<br>
The interference data collected by wire/antenna 416 and the incoming data from active DSL loop 424 is converted from analog to digital form by converters 442. Again, the interference noise data is filtered by filter 441, which bases its conditioning of the interference noise on the output of subtractor 440. The received data from loop 424 can<br>
15      be delayed by delay element 443. The conditioned data from loop 424 and antenna 416 is then input to subtractor 440 so that the interference noise can be removed and the remaining user data passed on to the other modem components, modules and/or processing. Additional antennas can be brought into service using other wires from inactive loops of segment 406. For example, as shown by the dashed connections 454,<br>
20      wires 413, 414, 415 can be employed as needed. The ADC 442 may then be more than just a single converter and may instead be any suitable conversion circuitry, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. Similarly, in such a case, filter 441 may be adaptive filtering circuitry, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.<br>
Finally, multiple wires in segment 406 can be used to remove interference. As <br>
25     	will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the systems disclosed in United States Serial No. 10/808,771, filed March 25,2004, entitled "High Speed Multiple Loop DSL System," incorporated by reference above, can provide extra phone lines and/or antennas and cancel interference in more than one telephone line (if they are bonded and vectored as described in the referenced '771 application). Thus, the system can be viewed as<br>
-13-<br><br>
WO 2006/051359	PCT/IB2005/0023I8<br>
having additional lines/antennas, and again the RF or other noise and/or interference is canceled in all the lines.<br>
In the example of Figure 4, there are 8 wires in the segment 406, only two of which are in use, the two used for loop 424. The other 6 wires could be used as follows –<br>
5     	wire 416 for collecting RF interference data, wires 411-415 for collecting interference data for the 5 most significant crosstalkers affecting loop 424. That is, in a system having N telephone loops or lines available, where one of the telephone loops is the active DSL line, one or more wires in the remaining N-l loops can act as the antenna or antenna means to collect interference data. Since there are 2 wires in each loop, there are 2(N-1)<br>
10      wires available for collecting interference data affecting the signals received by a modem using the active DSL line. Any suitable interference canceling means can be used in connection with the antenna(s), including more than one type of interference canceling structure where more than one type of interference noise is being removed and/or canceled. Each wire can be used to remove a single source of interference noise (for<br>
15      example, AM radio interference, a household appliance near the segment, crosstalk, etc.). Each wire's interference data can be converted to digital form and be filtered appropriately, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.<br>
Figures 5 A and 5B illustrate the types of data that can be collected and other data involved in embodiments of the present invention. In both Figures 5A and 5B the<br>
20     antenna used to collect interference data was a supplemental phone line/loop. Figure 5A shows plots of the power spectral density (PSD) of the received signal 502 compared to the noise 504 present in the received data. The relatively straight line representing the signal in the lower frequencies of Figure 5 A indicates that no bridged tap is present on the line. In the example of Figure 5A, the loop is 17,000 feet and is provisioned at 192 kbps.<br>
25       Using various dynamic spectrum management techniques, that line's data rate can be increased to at least approximately 768 kbps. Importantly in the context of the present invention, the effects of RF interference (primarily in the form of AM radio interference) 520 can be seen in the noise plot 504. Similarly, Figure 5B illustrates an 8,000 foot loop pro visioned at 1,536 kbps, capable of running at approximately 6,008 kbps or higher<br>
-14-<br><br>
WO 2006/051359	PCT/IB2005/002318<br>
using early DSM techniques. In Figure 5B the noise plot 514 also includes substantial RF interference 520, again caused primarily by AM radio interference. The insertion loss 512 of the loop is also plotted with the noise 514.<br>
One specific implementation of the multiple line/loop configuration is shown in <br>
5      	Figure 6. A connection configuration 600 includes a primary DSL service line 610, which is filtered at filter 620 in network interface device 640 to allow DSL service to modem 650 and primary POTS service at 630. This usually isolates the primary active DSL line/loop from the premises wiring to eliminate internal bridged taps and impulse noise sources. The microfilters shown do not need to be installed, but correspond to a<br>
10      preferred embodiment. Additional drop wires 615 also are filtered at filter 625 and may provide additional POTS service at 635. These additional wires 615 can be coupled to the modem 650 to provide one or more antennas according to embodiments of the present invention and/or to assist in other ways (for example, eliminating premises bridged taps, facilitating multi-line bonding and/or to facilitate multi-line vectoring). The connection<br>
15      from the NID to the DSL modem can be at least 4, and perhaps 8, 24-gauge twisted pairs (the same as or similar to category 5 wiring used for Ethernet, for example). A connector on/in the NID can attach these twisted pairs to some or all of the drop wires entering the NID, even if the other drop wires are unused presently. All lines/loops thus terminate at the modem 650, even if fewer than all are being used for DSL service.<br>
20	A method for removing noise from DSL or other communication signals received<br>
by a modem or other communication device, according to one embodiment of the present invention, is shown in Figure 7. Method 700 starts with the collection of interference data at 710 being performed by one or more suitable antennas, depending on the type(s) of interference present and the available antenna structure(s). As noted in Figure 7, the<br>
25     interference may be RF interference such as AM radio signal interference, crosstalk from neighboring communication lines, or other interference. At 720 the communication signal, including the user's payload data and interference noise, is received by the communication device. Finally, at 730 some or all of the interference noise is subtracted from the received communication signal using the interference data supplied by the<br>
-15-<br><br>
WO 2006/051359	PCT/IB2005/002318<br>
antenna(s). When multiple wires and/or antennas are available and more than one source of interference noise is present, method 700 may be applied iteratively or otherwise to remove more than one type and/or source of interference, either completely or partially, according to one ore more embodiments of the present invention.<br>

ABSTRACT<br>
"INTERFERENCE CANCELLATION SYSTEM"<br>
"A DSL or other communication system includes a modem or other communication device having at least one antenna that is configured to collect interference data relating to interference noise affecting communication signals being received by the communication device. The interference may include RF interference, such as AM radio interference, crosstalk and other types of interference from various sources. The interference data collected by the antenna is used by an interference canceller to remove and/or cancel some or all of the interference affecting received signals. In some embodiments of the present invention, more than one antenna may be used, wherein each antenna can collect interference data pertaining to a single source of interference noise. Where a modem or other communication device is coupled to multiple telephone lines, only one of which is being used as the active DSL line, wires in the remaining telephone lines or loops can be used as antennas. Moreover, the antenna may be an antenna, per se, such as a compact AM radio antenna or any other suitable structure or device for collecting the type(s) of interference affecting signals received by the communication device."<br>
