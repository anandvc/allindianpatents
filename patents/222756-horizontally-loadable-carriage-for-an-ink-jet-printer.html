BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The general design and construction of carriages that retain and align ink-<br>
jet print cartridges in printers and scan these print cartridges through print<br>
zones is well known. Examples of the patents that have issued in this field<br>
of technology include:<br>
US Patent 4,755,836 entitled "Printhead Cartridge and Carriage Assembly"<br>
by Ta et al. issued 5 July 1988<br>
US Patent 4,872,026 entitled "Ink-jet Printer with Printhead Carriage<br>
Alignment Mechanism" by Rasmussen et al. issued 3 October 1989<br>
US Patent 4,907, 018 entitled "Printhead-Carriage Alignment and Electrical<br>
Interconnect Lock-in Mechanism" by Pinkerpell issued 6 March 1990<br>
US Patent 5,392,063 entitled "Spring Cartridge Clamp for InkJet Printer<br>
Carriage" by Rhoads issued 21 February 1995.<br>
Prior carriages have been designed to be loaded and unloaded either vertically<br>
or with a steep, inclined, arcuate motion. Such carriages have proven to be<br>
satisfactory as long as vertical access to the printer is provided. This has<br>
meant, however, that nothing could be permanently stacked on top of the<br>
printer.<br>
Further, previous top loading ink-jet printer designs have fostered an<br>
increasing growth in printer height so that with each new printer design, the<br>
profile of the product grew and grew.<br>
Additionally, it is believed that end users want a printer for home use that can<br>
be stacked in an entertainment center or used in living rooms. This is a printer<br>
that has flat top and bottom walls, that is front loading with all controls and<br>
status indicators on the front wall, and that is about the same size as a<br>
conventional stereo amplifier or a video cassette recorder (VCR). In other<br>
words, this is a horizontally loadable ink-jet printer with an overall height of<br>
less than four inches (4").<br>
Such requirements result in numerous design challenges. First, nearly all existing datum<br>
structures on present day ink-jet print cartridges are designed for vertical or near vertical<br>
installation. Front or horizontal loading has heretofore not been contemplated so if an<br>
existing datum structure is to be used, the print cartridge must be positioned in an entirely<br>
new manner. Second, on a front loading printer the field of view available to a user<br>
during cartridge installation is quite restricted. The user sees less of the carriage and less<br>
of the loading process. Third, physical access to the carriage is more limited. Fourth, if<br>
multiple print cartridges are used, they must sit so close together that much of their<br>
gripping surfaces is unavailable for unloading the print cartridge from the printer.<br>
Thus, it is apparent from the foregoing that although there are many different<br>
carriage designs, designing a front loading, staclcable, low height ink-jet printer presents<br>
many challenges.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Briefly and in general terms, an apparatus according to the invention includes a a<br>
carriage body translatable within an ink-jet printer, a chute mounted on the carriage body<br>
for receiving an ink-jet print cartridge, and a generally horizontal rail on one of the<br>
sidewalls of the chute for guiding an ink-jet print cartridge into the carriage.<br>
Other aspects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the<br>
following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings,<br>
illustrating by way of example the principles of the invention.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
As shown in the drawings for the purposes of illustration, the invention is embodied in a<br>
front loading, stackable, low height, ink-jet printer.<br>
The apparatus offers a simple, inexpensive solution, easy self-evident operation, and<br>
leverages the datum structure from a print cartridge currently in production.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, reference numeral 14 generally indicates an ink-jet printer partially<br>
cut away and with its front loading door removed. The printer includes a case part 15 and<br>
a DC drive motor 16 mounted on a chassis. Mounted on the shaft of the motor 16 is a<br>
pulley 17 that drives a belt 18 back and forth as the drive motor reverses in direction.<br>
The drive belt 18 is attached to a carriage 19 that scans laterally back and forth from left<br>
to right and right to left. The carriage 19 contains two thermal ink-jet print cartridges 20,<br>
20' located side by side. Print cartridge 20 contains black ink, and print cartridge 20'has<br>
three ink chambers containing magenta, yellow and cyan inks. The horizontal scanning<br>
motion of the carriage is guided by a slide rod 21. Located in the rear of the carriage 19<br>
is an encoder, not shown, that reads an encoder strip 22 that enables the electronic circuits<br>
in the printer to locate the carriage 19 along its scanning path. After the printer 14 prints<br>
a sheet of media, the media is ejected into an output tray on which a handle 23 is<br>
mounted.<br>
In Fig. 2, the "X* axis is parallel with the longitudinal axis of the slide rod 21, Fig. 1. The<br>
"Y" axis is pointed to the rear and into the printer 14, Fig. 1, and is in the reverse<br>
direction to the path of the paper through the print zone. The "Z" axis is pointing<br>
vertically upward.<br>
Referring now particularly to Figs. 2 and 7, the carriage 19 includes a carriage base 26<br>
that supports the structure. The carriage base has two "C" shaped arch supports 28<br>
located at its ends. These arch supports provide bearing support and engage the slide rod<br>
21, Fig. 1.<br>
Referring to Figs. 2, 5, and 6, the carriage 19 also includes two chutes 31 that each<br>
receive, hold, and align an ink-jet print cartridge 20 as illustrated in Fig. 2. Both chutes<br>
are constructed and operate in the same manner; so for brevity only the left chute will be<br>
described. The chute 31 has a left side wall 33, a right side wall 34, and a rear or end<br>
wall 35. Located on the rear wall 35 of the chute is a dimpled contact pad 37. The<br>
contact pad has an elastomeric backing and contains electrical contacts that are urged<br>
against corresponding contacts on the print cartridge 20. In this manner the printer 14<br>
makes electrical contact with the print cartridge and supplies electrical energy to the<br>
firing resistors during printing.<br>
Dimpled contact pads for thermal ink-jet print cartridges and carriages are disclosed in<br>
US Patent 4,706,097 entitled "Near-Linear Spring Connect Structure for Flexible<br>
Interconnect Circuits" by Harmon issued 10 November 1987.<br>
The dimpled contact pads 37, Figs. 3, 5, and 6, are held in place against the rear wall 35<br>
of each chute 31 by six pins 42, 43 located on the carriage base 26. Pin 42 locates the<br>
dimpled contact pad left and right and vertically in the carriage 19. The other five pins<br>
prevent the contact pad from rotating about the center pin 42 and inducing any stress in<br>
the contact pad.<br>
Referring to Figs. 3,5, and 6, located on each side wall 33, 34, of the chute 31 is a guide<br>
rail 40. The guide rails are the guiding feature for installing and removing print<br>
cartridges from the printer 14. Referring to Fig. 3, in particular, each guide rail is<br>
generally horizontal, curved, arcuate, and inclined slightly upward in the positive "Y"<br>
direction as illustrated in Fig. 2. The guide rails 40 engage the bottom of the lips located<br>
on the sidewalls of certain print cartridges.<br>
Further, the guide rails 40 in the chutes 31, Figs. 5 and 6 serve many functions. First, the<br>
rails act as a target for the user when initially installing a print cartridge. They aid in<br>
locating the print cartridge 20 in the carriage 19, Fig. 1 which is only partially visible to<br>
the user. Second, once the print cartridge is resting on the guide rails and the print<br>
cartridge is pushed forward by the user, the rails guide the print cartridge up and over the<br>
primary and secondary carriage datums, described in detail below. Third, when a print<br>
cartridge is being unlatched from the carriage by the user, the guide rails limit the<br>
rotation of the print cartridge so that it does not come tumbling out of the printer.<br>
Referring to Figs. 3 and 5, located in the right side wall 34 of each chute 31 is a cantilever<br>
spring 46. The spring 46 has a major axis that is horizontal. The cantilever spring biases<br>
or urges the print cartridge horizontally in the negative "X" direction as illustrated in Fig.<br>
2, against the primary datums, as described in detail below.<br>
In Figs. 2,3,4, 5, and 6, reference numeral 48 indicates a latch spring having a horizontal<br>
tab pointing rearward in an ink-jet printer 14, Fig. 1, along the "Y" axis as illustrated in<br>
Fig. 2. The spring is directed in this manner to achieve the low printer height objective.<br>
The latch spring engages a latch molded into the lid of the print cartridge as illustrated in<br>
Fig. 2. There is a latch spring for each chute 31, and they are fabricated from a single<br>
sheet metal part as illustrated in Fig. 4. The part is attached to features molded in the<br>
outside walls of the chutes 31. The part is also attached to an arresting ringer SO located<br>
on the center side wall of the carriage 19. The arresting finger has the shape of an "L"<br>
and prevents the mechanical strain from installing a print cartridge in one chute from<br>
affecting the print cartridge in the chute along side.<br>
Referring to Figs. 5, 6, and 7, located on the inside of the left side wall 33 at the bottom<br>
of the chute 31 are the primary datums 52. The corresponding datums on the print .<br>
cartridge are urged against the primary datums 52 in the chute by the cantilever spring<br>
in the right side wall 34 of the chute 31. Located on the inside of the right side wall 34 at<br>
the bottom of the chute 31 and directly opposite the primary datums 52 are the secondary<br>
datums 54. There is a single tertiary datum 56 located in the rear wall 35 of the chute 31<br>
above the dimpled contact pad 37. The tertiary datum locates the rotation of a print<br>
cartridge about the "X" axis to a known point.<br>
Although specific embodiments of the invention have been described and<br>
illustrated, the invention is not to be limited to the specific forms or arrangement of parts<br>
so described and illustrated. The invention is limited only by the claims.<br>
