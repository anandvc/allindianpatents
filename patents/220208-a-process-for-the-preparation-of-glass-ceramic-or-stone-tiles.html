				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This  invention relates to a process for  the<br>
manufacture   of   glass  and/or  ceramic   tiles.    In particular this invention relates  to a process  for the<br>
manufacture  of  glass or ceramic tiles  having  a  matt surface  and rounded edges.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
A   process   known  in  the  art   for   the<br>
manufacture  of glass tiles consists in  passing  molten glass between the nip of two rollers and such as to form<br>
a  sheet  of  tiles and,  wherein,  adjacent  tiles  are separated  by  a  V  notch.  One  of  said  rollers  has<br>
serrations to impart a roughened surface to the base  of the  tiles.    The other  roller has  normally  a  plain<br>
surface  and  such as to impart  a  corresponding  plain surface  to  the front face of the tile.   The  adjacent<br>
tiles are separated from each other at the V notch which are then cooled.<br>
The  process  of  manufacturing  glass   from<br>
pulverised or crushed glass and employed for  filtration applications  is also known in the art.  Such a  process<br>
consists  in  adding a binder to  pulverised  glass  and which is then pressed in a mould.  The pulverised  glass<br>
used  for such applications has a  substantial  particle<br>
size  so as to impart the required porous properties  to the glass.  Such a compacted  mass is heated or fired to<br>
a  temperature at which glass becomes slightly  viscous. It   would   be  apparent  that  such   a   glass   must<br>
necessarily   be   permeable   and   possess    porosity properties,  as  the glass is  employed  for  filtration<br>
purposes.<br>
Another  process  is known in the  art  which<br>
envisages   the   use  of  pulverised  glass   for   the manufacture of glass tiles.  Such a process consists  in<br>
grinding or pulverising glass of a single type or colour to a fine mesh size of approximately 100 to 200 mesh and<br>
to  which  is added a dispersing agent and  a colouring agent  and/or  opacifying agent.   Such a  raw  meal  is<br>
pressed in a mould and then fired to a temperature above the  softening point, but not high enough to deform  the<br>
tile.  The temperature normally  employed is about 700°C or above, depending on the property of glass.<br>
Several distinct disadvantages are associated with such a known process for the manufacture of a glass<br>
tile.  One such disadvantage is that the tile had  sharp edges.<br>
Another  disadvantaqe  is the addition  of  a<br>
dispersing agent to the raw meal, and which  contributes to  the end cost of the tile.  It is generally  believed<br>
that  such a dispersing agent was added to the raw  meal for  performing  two  functions.   The  first  of   such<br>
function  was  to  allow  a  proper  dispersion  of  the colouring and/or opacifying agent. The colour propertiem<br>
to  the  tiles were imparted by the  addition  of  known colouring agent.   Similarly, the opacifying  properties<br>
to  the  tiles were imparted by the  addition  of  known opacifying agents.<br>
The   second  function is correlated  to  the<br>
fine  particle  size  of  the  crushed  glass.   It   is generally believed that a dispersing agent was added  to<br>
the  crushed  glass as the glass employed in  the  known process  was  crushed  to a  very  fine  particle  size.<br>
Further, it would be apparent that as a colouring and/or opacifying  agent was added to the raw meal, a  chemical<br>
reaction takes place during the step of firing to impart the  required aforesaid properties to the tiles and  for<br>
which  a gradual raising of temperature at the rate of 5°C/min was required with a further a soaking period  of<br>
at least on hour.  Thereafter, the tiles were  subjected to a gradual  cooling.<br>
Yet  another process is known from our  prior<br>
Indian  patent no.157991 which consisted in  crushing  a single   or different glass to form a  mixture of  glass<br>
of  a particle size not less than 10 mesh.  The  mixture is  crushed under pressure to form a  shaped  composite,<br>
which is then heated to a temperature of 800 to 900°C to allow a further compaction of at least 5%.  Such a  step<br>
of heating causes a deformation of the edges of the tile so   as   to  cause  a  rounding  of   the   edges   and<br>
simultaneously to impart a polished or glazed surface to the  tile.   Silica  is  also added to  the  mix  as  an<br>
additive. OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
An  object of this invention is to propose  a<br>
novel  process  for  the  manufacture  of  glass  and/or ceramic  tiles having a matt surface.<br>
Another  object  of  this  invention  is   to propose  a  process  for the manufacture  of  glass  and<br>
ceramic tiles having a matt surface with smooth edges.<br>
Still another object of this invention is  to<br>
propose  a  process  for the manufacture  of  glass   or ceramic  tiles having a matt surface with  smooth  edges<br>
and with a speck surface.<br>
A  further  object of this  invention  is  to<br>
propose  a process for the manufacture of  glass and/or ceramic  tiles having a matt surface with  smooth  edge*<br>
which is economical. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION.<br>
According to this invention there is provided a  process for the manufacture of glass  and/or  ceramic<br>
tiles having a matt surface and rounded edges comprising in  subjecting   the form tiles having sharp   edge  and<br>
glazed/matt or speck surface to the step of an  abrasive action by putting said tiles into a drum having abrasive<br>
material contained therein under the normal  temperature and  pressure  till the tiles get the matt  surface  and<br>
round edges.<br>
In   accordance  with  this  invention,   the<br>
starting  material comprises a formed tile having  sharp or  jagged edges or tiles of irregular or  broken  shape<br>
and glazed/matt or speck surface.  The tile is subjected to the abrasive process of the present invention to form<br>
smooth edges and also to impart a matt surface.<br>
The  abrasive   action/abrasive  process   i»<br>
carried  out  in a dry form.   Thus, and as  by way  of example,  an abrasive material like silica, sand  and/or<br>
grinding media is introduced  into a rotatablc  drum and the   tiles   are   introduced   into   such   a   drum.<br>
Alternatively,  such a step of abrasion comprises a  wet process  in which water is added  to the  dry   abrasive<br>
media contained  in the drum.<br>
Preferably,  a  matt surface is  imparted  to<br>
tile  which is totally coloured and can also include   a tile  having a coloured coating on the top  surface  the<br>
tiles can also have  specified surface.<br>
A  process  for the manufacture  of  a  glass<br>
ceramic  tiles having a matt surface and  rounded  edges according to a preferred embodiment is herein  described<br>
in the details.<br>
The   form  tiles  having  sharp  edges   and<br>
glazed/matt  or   speck surface in accordance  with  the process  of this invention are subjected to the step  of<br>
abrasive action by putting the formed tiles into a  drum having  an abrasive material  like silica, sand  and  or<br>
grinding  media therein in the dried form and under  the room  temperature  and pressure.  The time  required  to<br>
provide the matt surface and rounded edges to the  tiles<br><br>
depends on the hardness of the tiles and rotating/vibrating speed of the machine. Generally the time required for providing the matt surface and rounded edge is in the range of 1-4 hours. This constitutes a dry process.<br>
According  to   an  option  the   process  of abrasion  comprises  a wet process.   For  this purpose water  is added to the abrasive media contained  in  the drum.<br><br><br><br><br>
I CLAIM:<br>
1.	A  process for the manufacture  of  glass  and/or<br>
ceramic   tiles having a matt surface and rounded edges<br>
comprising  in subjecting  the form tiles  having  sharp<br>
edge and glazed/matt or speck surface to the step of  an<br>
abrasive action by putting said tiles into a drum having<br>
abrasive material contained therein under the normal temperature and pressure till the tiles get the matt surface and round edges.<br>
2.	A  process  as claimed in claim  1  wherein  said<br>
abrasive   material  comprises  silica,  sand   and/or<br>
grinding media.<br>
3.	A  process as  claimed in claim  1  wherein  said<br>
tiles are subjected to the abrasive action for a  period<br>
of 1-4 hours.<br>
4.	A  process as claimed in claims 1 to  3,  wherein<br>
water is added to the abrasive media contained  in  said<br>
drum.<br>
5.	A process for the manufacture of glass ceramic  or<br>
stone  tiles  having a matt surface  and  rounded  edges<br>
substantially as herein described and illustrated.<br></td>
