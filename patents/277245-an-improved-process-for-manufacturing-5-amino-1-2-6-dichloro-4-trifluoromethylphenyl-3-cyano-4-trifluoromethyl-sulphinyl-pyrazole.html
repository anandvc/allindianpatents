THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE <br>
INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED. <br>

FIELD OF THE INVENTION <br>
<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing 	5-amino-l-(2,6-dichloro-4-<br>
<br>
trifluoromethylphenyI)-3-cyano-4-trifluoromethyl sulphinyl pyrazole. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION. <br>
<br>
<br>
Fipronil [5-Amino- I -(2,6-dichloro-4-trifluoromethylphenyI)-3-cyano-4-trifluoromethyl <br>
sulphinyl pyrazole] is one of the important fluorine bearing 1-Aryl pyrazole derivatives <br>
developed in the recent two decades. It is a novel pesticide characterized by high <br>
efficiency, low toxicity and especially low residue. There are various routes to synthesize <br>
fipronil by oxidation of thiopyrazole with various other oxidizing agents in suitable <br>
solvents. <br>
The known commercial processes for manufacture of fipronil using corrosive and expensive chemical such as trifluoroacetic acid/hydrogen peroxide, m-chloroperbenzoic acid/dichloromethane/chloroform and the like have implication from commercial point of view namely,'use of expensive trifluoroacetic acid in large quantities as well as use of m-<br>
chloroperbenzoic acid which is difficult to handle at commercial scale due to it's unstability and detonating effect. <br>
Oxidation of sulfides is a very useful route for the preparation of sulfoxides. Literature is <br>
replete with the conversion of sulfides to sulfoxides and/or sulfones. However, most of <br>
the existing methods use expensive, toxic or rare oxidizing reagents, which are difficult <br>
<br>
<br>
2 <br>
 <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
to prepare and use them at commercial scale. Many of these processes suffer from poor selectivity. A number of oxidants like sodium vanadate, sodium tungstate, peracetic acid, performic acid and pertrifluoroacetic acid have been employed in an attempt to obtain regioselective oxidation to provide 5-amino-l-(2,6,-dichloro-4-trifluoromethylphenyl)-3-<br>
cyano-4-trifluoromethyl sulphinylpyrazole. <br>
WO 01/30760 describes oxidation of 5-amino-l-(2,6-dichloro-4-trifluoromethylphenyl)-<br>
3-cyano-4-trifluoromethyl thio-pyrazole with trifluoroacetic acid and hydrogen peroxide <br>
in presence of boric acid. The quantity of trifluoroacetic acid used is 1610 g/mole (14.08 <br>
m/m). <br>
<br>
<br>
European Patent publication No.295117 	describes the preparation of 5-amino-l-(2,6-<br>
dichloro-4-trifluoromethylphenyl)-3-cyano-4-trifluoromethyl sulphinylpyrazole by the oxidation of 5-amino- I (2,6-dichloro-4-trifluoromethylphenyl)-3-cyano-4-trifluoromethyl thiopyrazole with 3-chloroperbenzoic acid in chloroform. <br>
<br>
The oxidation of electron deficient sulfides such as trifluoromethylsulfides, which are less readily oxidised than other sulfides, entails several difficulties. The molecule has to be stable under the desired conditions of oxidation and oxidation should proceed to the desired extent with minimum of by products such as formation of sulfonyl and amide derivatives. At the same time, level of starting material should be very low such so that product of acceptable quality can be achieved. Oxidants such as peracids, peroxides, persulfates have been widely used for effecting the oxidation. <br>
<br>
<br>
3 <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Various organic solvents such as trifluroacetic acid, mixtures of trichloro/dichloroacetic acid, dichloromethane and chloroform are employed to bring about the oxidation of 5-<br>
amino- l -(2,6-dichloro-4-trifluoromethylphenyl)-3-cyano-4-trifluoromethyl thio-pyrazole. Use of mineral acid as a medium is not useful due to instability of the compound towards strong mineral acids. <br>
Trifluoroacetic acid and trichloroacetic acid were found to be very efficient and <br>
regioselective oxidation medium for oxidation of 5-amino-l-(2,6-dichloro-4-<br>
trifluoromethylphenyl)-3-cyano-4-trifluoromethyl thio-pyrazole in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. However, trichloroacetic acid 'can not be used alone due to higher melting point and need to be used in presence of a melting point depressant. Trifluoroacetic acid on the other hand is very regioselective with respect to conversion and low by-products formation. However, it suffers with disadvantages such as it is expensive, water miscible, corrosive to metal as well as glass, comparatively lower boiling and it's recovery (in anhydrous form) is complex in nature. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Accordingly, it is desired to develop a substitute for corrosive and expensive solvent <br>
<br>
(trifluoro	acetic	acid)	for	the	synthesis	of	5-amino-l-(2,6-dichloro-4-<br>
trifluoromethylphenyl)-3-cyano-4-trifluoromethyl sulphinyl pyrazole and a process employing such inexpensive, easily available but effective alternative solvent. <br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION <br>
Several process problems are encountered when trifluoro acetic acid (TFA) is used as a <br>
solvent for oxidation of 5-amino-1 -(2,6-dichloro-4-trifluoromethylphenyl)-3-cyano-4-<br>
trifluoromethyl thio pyrazole with 50 % aqueous hydrogen peroxide. The main problem is selection of material of construction of equipment for conducting the experiment. Due to corrosive environment under the oxidation condition, both MSGL and SS reactor can not be normally used. <br>
WO 01/30760 discloses a process for the preparation of fipronil using trifluoroacetic acid <br>
in an amount of about 14.4 m/m of thio pyrazole. It further discloses addition of <br>
<br>
corrosion inhibiting compounds such as boric acid to the reaction mixture to inhibit the <br>
<br>
corrosion and reduces the speed of corrosion to a level, which permits the use of glass <br>
<br>
reactor. However, the process disclosed in WO	01/30760	suffers with several<br>
<br>
disadvantages such as trifluoroacetic acid is a costly religent and its process economy<br>
<br>
<br>
8 <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
depends on its recovery and recycles. Further, trifluoroacetic acid is wet because it forms <br>
azeotrope with water, (water from aqueous hydrogen peroxide) and to get anhydrous <br>
trifluoroacetic acid from this requires azeotropic distillation in presence of concentrated <br>
H,S04. Moreover, residual TFA is converted to its alkyl ester (methyl, ethyl and others), <br>
which needs to be converted back to TFA. Thus, use of TVA as a solvent for oxidation of <br>
<br>
5-amino-l-(2,6-dichloro-4-trifluoromethylphenyl)-3-cyano-4-trifluoromethyl  thio pyrazole <br>
<br>
is difficult and expensive from commercial point of view. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Therefore, the present invention is centered on finding a solution to this problem by <br>
selecting a solvent or a mixture of solvent which provides selective degree of oxidation as that of trifluoroacetic acid. <br>
In accordance with the present invention there is provided a process for the preparation of a compound of formula (I). <br>

<br>
In accordance with another preferred embodiment of the present invention the solvent <br>
system comprises trichloroacetic acid and trifluoroacetic acid in a ratio of 80: 20% w/w. <br>
The quantity of peroxide used depends on required optimal conversion with minimum by <br>
product formation such as sulfone and amide derivative. In accordance with the preferred <br>
embodiment of the present invention the proportion of hydrogen peroxide used is about <br>
1.05 to about 1.2 moles per mole of the compound of formula II. The sulfone derivative <br>
<br>
formed under this condition is less than 1.8 to 2.5 % w/w. <br>
In accordance with the present invention the concentration of hydrogen peroxide used in the reaction is in the range of about 45 to about 70% w/w. <br>
In accordance with the present invention one of the corrosion inhibiting compounds employed in the reaction is boric acid. <br>
Typically, the amount of corrosion inhibiting compound employed is about 2g/m to I Og/m of 5-amino-I -(2,6-dichloro-4-trifluoromethylphenyl)-3-cyano-4-trifluoromethyl thio pyrazole. <br>
<br>
Preferably, the amount of corrosion inhibiting compound employed is about 4g/m to 6g/m of 5-amino- l -(2,6-dichloro-4-trifluoromethylphenyl)-3 -cyano-4-trifluoromethyl thio pyrazole. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 <br>
 <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The reaction temperature is chosen so as to have selective kinetics of oxidation as well as <br>
the stability of the peracid under the reaction condition. Therefore, in accordance with the <br>
present invention the process is carried out at a temperature in the range of about 0 to <br>
50°C. <br>
<br>
In accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention the process is carried out at a temperature in the range of about 10 to 30°C. <br>

m-chloroperbenzoic acid as prepared above was added in lots over a period of 6 hours. <br>
The mixture was stirred at 15 °C. HPLC analysis showed 27 % Fipronil conversion after <br>
5 hours and 29.9 % conversion after 10 hours of maintenance at 15 °C . To this was <br>
<br>
added 0.5 m/m of 78 % hydrogen peroxide in lots and the reaction temperature was raised<br>
<br>
to	25	°C. HPLC analysis showed 46 % Fipronil conversion after further 12 hours of<br>
<br>
maintenance at 25 °C.<br>
<br>
<br>
Example 5 <br>
50 	g of a solvent mixture containing trichloroacetic acid, dichloroacetic acid and <br>
monochloroacetic acid (gle ratio = 33: 57:10 % w/w) was charged in a reactor. To this 13 <br>
g (0.0308 m, 99.9 %) of 5-amino-1-(2,6-dichloro-4-trifluoromethylphenyl)-3-cyano-4-<br>
trifluoromethyl thiopyrazole was added and the mixture was cooled to 8-10 °C. To this mixture 2.8 g'( 0.8 m/m ) of 81 % tert-butyl hydrogen peroxide was added in lots over a period of 2 hours. The mixture was then maintained for 15 hours at 10 °C and 8 hours at 30 °C. HPLC analysis showed only 2.9 % Fipronil. , <br>
