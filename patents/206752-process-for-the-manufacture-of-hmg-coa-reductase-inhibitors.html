PROCESS FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF HMG-COA REDUCTASE INHIBITORS<br><br>
The invention relates to a process for the manufacture of enantiomerically pure HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, to process steps and to novel intermediates.<br>
HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (also called β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl-co-enzyme-A reductase inhibitors and also called statins) are understood to be those active agents which may be preferably used to lower the lipid levels including cholesterol in blood and can be used e.g. for the prevention or treatment of hyperlipidemia and artheriosclerosis.<br>
The class of HMG-Co-A reductase inhibitors comprises compounds having differing structural features. For example, mention may be made of the compounds which are selected from the group consisting of atorvastatin, cerivastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pitavastatin (formerly itavastatin), pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin, or, in each case, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
Preferred HMG-Co-A reductase inhibitors are those agents which have been marketed, most preferred is fluvastatin, atorvastatin, pitavastatin, especially the Calcium salt thereof, or simvastatin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br><br>
is disclosed and claimed in US 5,273,995. Cerivastatin of formula<br><br><br>
is disclosed and claimed in US 5,177,080.<br>
Racemic fluvastatin witli syn-configuration of the hydroxy groups in formula<br><br>
is disclosed and claimed in US 5,345.772.<br><br>
is disclosed and claimed in US 4,231,938. Pitavastatin of formula<br><br><br>
is disclosed and claimed in US 5,856,336. Pravastatin of formula<br><br>
is disclosed and claimed in US 5,260,440. Simvastatin of formula<br><br><br>
I<br>
is disclosed and claimed in US 4,444,784.<br>
The structure of the active agents identified hereinbefore or hereinafter by generic or tradenames may be taken from the actual edition of the standard compendium "The Merck Index" or from databases, e.g. Patents International or LifeCycle Patents International, respectively, (e.g. IMS World Publications). The corresponding content thereof is hereby incorporated by reference. Any person skilled in the art is fully enabled to identify the active agents and, based on these references, likewise enabled to manufacture and test the pharmaceutical indications and properties in standard test models, both in vitro and in vivo.<br>
Acidic representatives of HMG-Co-A reductase inhibitors have been launched are being developed as salts, for example, fluvastatin as sodium salt and pitavastatin as calcium salt.<br>
The corresponding active ingredients or a pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may also be used in form of a solvate, such as a hydrate or including other solvents, used for crystallization.<br>
Essentially, statins comprise a cyclic core element and a side chain element of formula<br><br>
(a 3,5-dihydroxy-hept-6-enoic acid moiety) that might form a corresponding lactone partial structure of formula<br><br><br>
In said side chain elements (II a) or (II c), respectively, the 3,5-syn diol structure and the R-configuration at C-3 are essential features, as corresponding statins with this specific element exhibit the highest biological activity.<br>
The objective of the present invention is to provide an enantioselectlve synthesis of compounds of formula (I) resulting in high yields and moreover guaranteeing a minimization of the ecological pollution of the environment, being economically attractive, e.g. by using less reaction steps In the reaction sequence for the manufacture of compounds of formula I, and leading to largely enantiomerically pure target products and to products of high crystallisability. Furthermore, another objective of the present invention is to provide a process that can be carried out In a larger scale and can thus be used for a corresponding production process. Furthermore, there Is a need to avoid any separation and disposal of any stereoisomers.<br>
Surprisingly, the process of the present invention clearly meets the above objectives. The process relates to an enantioselectlve synthesis by using essentially the so-called Wlttig-Wadsworth-Emmons (Wittlg-Horner) or Wittig condensation via chemical desymmetrisation. For example, an enantiomeric excess (ee) of a compound of formula (I) or a salt thereof of ≥ 95%. preferably ≥  98% and most preferably ≥ 99% can be achieved, Moreover an ee of ≥ 99.5% can easily be obtained. Furthermore, according to the present invention, a<br><br>
diasteromeric excess (de) of ≥ 95%, preferably ≥ 98% and most preferably ≥ 99% can easily be achieved for a compound of formula (I) or a salt thereof obtained according to the present invention.<br><br>
A salt of a compound of formula (I) is, for example, a salt with a base, preferably a corresponding pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br><br>
Corresponding cyclic residue R comprises a cyclic residue selected from the group consisting of<br><br><br>
Extensive experimental evaluations surprisingly resulted in a process sequence for the manufacture that meets the above criteria showing the indicated advantages.<br>
Compared to the process as disclosed in J.Org.Chem. 1991, 56, 3744-3747, it has been surprisingly found that the process according to the present invention can be simplified by omitting (i) the oxidation step with N2O4 forming the corresponding N-nitrosamine and (ii) the hydrolysis to form of the free acid and (ill) the methylation to form the methylester.<br>
It has been proven, that the reaction sequence according to the present invention, especially when using corresponding starting material and intermediates exhibiting the amide function wherein the amide element is repesented by formula<br><br><br>
f<br>
leads to the above-mentioned advantages.<br>
Furthermore, in a recent publication [Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 9 (1999) 2977-2982)] an improved process for the manufacture of pitavastatin has been disclosed describing the step-by-step formation of the side chain of formula (II a) resulting in a mixture of diastereomers that need to be separated. Consequently, one half of the diastereomer cannot be used. In opposite to said procedure, the process of the present invention is clearly more economic.<br><br>

A compound of formula (III c) wherein X is N-C1-C7alkyl-N-C1-C7alkoxy-amino, especially N-methyl-N-methoxy-amino, is likewise a subject matter of the present invention.<br><br>
Furthermore, the present invention also relates to reaction step (a), especially when using a compound of fonnula (III c), wherein X is preferably N-C1-C7aalkyl-N-C1-C7-alkoxy-amino, most preferably N-methyl-N-methoxy-amino. When applY1ng this method, no substantial p-elimination of the protected hydroxy group X1 is oberserved, especially in view of the presence of the phenyl-ethyl amide that is stabilising the protected hydroxy group preventing β-elimination and resulting in high selectivity for the substitution reaction.<br>
When corresponding diesters were used, it is known from the literature that β-eliminatlon occurs as side reaction and selectivity is significantly lower.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention also relates to reaction step (b), especially when using a compound of formula (III c), wherein X is preferably N-CrC7alkyl-N-C1-C7-alkoxy-amino, most preferably N-methyl-N-methoxy-amino. Here likewise, no p-elimination has been observed and a signicant selectivity of the reaction can be achieved.<br>

Here likewise, no β-elimination has been observed and a signicant selectivity of the reaction can be achieved.<br><br><br><br>
The present invention likewise relates to a compound of formulae (III e'), (III e") and (III e'") and the manufacture thereof.<br>
The present invention furthermore relates to corresponding compounds of formula (III g), especially those wherein Y3 is silyloxy, preferably tert-butyl-dimethyl-silyloxy.<br>
The present invention likewise relates to the novel compound as described in the Working Examples part.<br>
The present invention likewise relates to the concrete products directly obtained by the process sequence or by the single process steps, especially the corresponding products that are in an essentially enantiomerically pure form.<br>
The conversion of an acid of formula (I) into a salt is carried out in a manner known per se. Thus, for example, a salt with a base of compounds of the formula I is obtained by treating with a base. Salts can be converted into the free compounds in a customary manner, and salts with a base can be converted, for example, by treating with a suitable acid agent to the free acid.<br>
The conversion of an acid of formula (I) into a corresponding lactone of formula (I a) or (I b), respectively, is carried out in the presence of an acid, preferably a mineral acid, in a suitable, e.g. protic or aproctic, solvent, such as ethanol or acetonitrile. Depending on the acid, the conversion is carried out in a temperature range, for example, from -78° to the boiling point of the solvent. Most preferably, H3PO4 in acetonitrile at 60°C is used.<br>
The conversion of a lactone of formula (I a) or (I b), respectively, into a salt of the acid of formula (I) is carried out, for example, in mixture of a protic solvent, e.g. ethanol, and water, by using an alkalimetall hydroxide, such as LiOH, NaOH or Ca(0H)2. Alternatively, the<br><br>
lactone can be hydrolysed by using an alkalimetall hydroxide, such as LiOH, NaOH and the resulting salt can be converted into the calcium salt of the acid of pitavastatin by addition of an aqueous solution of CaCl3 in water.<br>
A variant to the process according to the present invention comprises the direct formation of a lactone of a compound of formula (I). The formation of said lactone can be carried out by treating a compound of formula (III h) with an acid, such as a mineral acid, preferable with H3PO4.<br>
The process for the manufacture of compounds of formula (I) and salts thereof can be, for example, illustrated by means of the following reaction scheme for the manufacture of pitavastatin:<br><br><br><br>
Working Examples:<br>
Manufacture of Starting Material<br><br>
3-(tert-Butyldimethylsilyloxy)-glutaric anhydride can be purchased from Aldrich. 3-(tert-Butyldimethylsilyloxy)-glutaric anhydride can be prepared as follows:<br><br><br>
A 4-necked, round bottomed flask, equipped with a mechanical stirrer, digital thermometer, nitrogen inlet-outlet and a condenser is charged with 3-hydroxyglutaric acid diethyl ester (107.5 g, 0.5 mole), imidazole (44.2 g 0.6 mole) and xylene (200 mL). The resulting mixture is heated to 70-80°C and t-butyldimethylchlorsilane (84.1 g 0.55 mole) dissolved in xylene (100 mL) are added drop wise over 30-40 minutes. Stirring is then prolonged for 3 to 6 hours at 70-80C. Afterwards the emulsion is cooled to room temperature and water (200 mL) is added. The lower aqueous phase is removed and the remaining organic phase washed again with water (100 mL). Then, ethanol (95 %, 200 mL) and a solution of potassium hydroxide (119.8 g a 49.2 %, 1.05 mole) are added to the organic phase. Stirring is maintained for about 10-20 hours at 15-25°C. Then water (1200 mL) and ethyl acetate (300 mL) are added to the slurry. The resulting emulsion is cooled to 0-15°C and sulfuric acid (about 230 ml 20 % solution in water) is added carefully at 0-15°C to end up with a pH value of 3.0-3.5 (acidification has to be done without interruption since the intermediate mono potassium salt is very labile and may decompose). The emulsion is then warm up to 15-20°C and the lower aqueous layer removed. The remaining organic phase is washed with water (200 mL). Tetrahydronaphtalene (100 mL) and water (200 mL) are added. After a short stirring the aqueous phase is removed again, and the remaining organic phase concentrated under vacuo to 1/2 (200-60 mbar) at 60-70°C. Then acetic anhydride (103.5 g, 1.0 mole) is added over 20-40 minute at 55-65°C and the solution stirred for 2-4 hours. The solution is concentrated again under vacuo (jacket 80°C, 100-20 mbar). Then heptan (600 mL) is added slowly by 30-40°C to allow the product to crystallise. The slurry is cooled to -15'°C, stirred for about 1 hour, and crystals are collected, washed with heptane (100 mL) and dried under vacuo (60°C, 10-20 mbar).

(3S,1'S)-3-[(tert-Butyldimethylsilyl)oxy]-5-[(1-phenyl-ethY1)amino]-5-oxopentanoic acid can be prepared according to a procedure as described in Donald. S. Karanewsky, Mary F. Malley and Jack Z. Gougoutas, J. Org. Chem. 1991, 56, 3744-3747, the corresponding method is herewith incorporated into the present application by reference.<br>
The procedure of Karanewsky et al. can be improved to achieve higher diastereoselectivities and higher Y1elds of the desired diastereomer by replacement of triethyl-amine with a more hindered base, especially N-ethyl-diisopropyl-amine. Said replacement results In better ratios and Y1elds of the desired diastereomer in comparison to the undesired one. When triethyl-amine is replaced with (S)-(-)-1-phenethylamine as a base, the desired diastereomer is obtained in higher Y1eld than described by Karanewsky et al. as well. This means that at least 2 moles of (S)-(-)-1-phenethylamine are used, one mole as substrate and at least one mole as base. Best ratios and Y1elds of the desired diastereomer are achieved, if a second molequivalent of (S)-(-)-1-phenethY1amine is used as a base, instead of the tertiary amine.

(E)-(3R,5S)-7-[2-Cyclopropyl-4-(4-fluoro-phenyl)quinolin-3-yl]-3,5-dihydroxy-hept-6-enoic acid ((S)-1-phenyl-ethyl)-amide (0.50 g, 0.95 mmol) is dissolved in ethanol (12.5 mL). Water (12.5 mL) and sodium hydroxide (5 mL of a 1M solution, 5 mmol) are added and the mixture is heated to ca. 80 °C in an oil bath. Stirring is continued for 18 h at ca. 80 °C. The solvent is distilled under reduced pressure and the residue is dissolved in water (50 mL). The water solution is extracted twice with tert-butyl-methyl ether (2 x 50 mL). The aqueous layer is concentrated in vacuo to a final volume of ca. 25 mL. Water (25 mL) is added, followed by the addition of calcium chloride (0.049 g, 0.044 mmol) under stirring at 30-35 ˚C.<br><br>
Precipitation occurs. The suspension is allowed to cool down to room temperature. The suspension is stirred for 2 h at room temperature and for additional 2.5 h at 15°C. The precipitate is isolated by filtration and the filter-cake is washed with water (5 mL). The product is dried in vacuo to obtain the Calcium salt of pitavastatin as a white powder. The acid component of the salt is identical with the acid component of an authentic sample of<br>
(E)-(3R,5S)-7-[2-Cyclopropyl-4-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-quinoiin-3-yl]-3,5-dihydroxy-hept-6-enoic acid, calcium salt (corresponding to the pitavastatin calcium salt) in IR and HPLC.<br>
Alternatively, (E)-(3R,5S)-7-[2-Cyclopropyl-4-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-quinolin-3-yl]-3,5-dihydroxy-hept-6-enoic acid and its calcium salt respectively can be prepared as follows:<br>
(E)-(3R,5S)-7-[2-Cyclopropyl-4-(4-fluoro-phenyl)quinorm-3-yl]-3,5-dihydroxy-hept-6-enoic acid ((S)-1-phenyl-ethyl)-amide (4.0 g, 6.53 mmol) is dissolved in ethanol (40 mL). Water (40 mL) and sodium hydroxide powder (2.64 g, 66 mmol) are added and the mixture is heated at 50-55 °C for 26 h, until an in-process control (HPLC) indicated complete conversion. Hydrochloric acid (59 mL of a 1M solution, 59 mmol) is added slowly over a time period of 15 minutes. The solvent is distilled under reduced pressure and the residue is dissolved in water (80 mL). The water solution is extracted with tert-butyl-methyl ether (3 x 80 mL) and the organic phase is removed. The water phase is evaporated under reduced pressure and the residue is re-dissolved in water (176 mL). Hydrochloric acid (6.53 mL of a 1M solution, 6.53 mmol) is added to precipitate the acid, followed by the addition of ethyl acetate (176 mL). The mixture is stirred for 15 min. and the layers are separated. The organic layer is washed with water (90 mL). Charcoal (0.5 g) is added to the organic layer and the mixture is stirred at 30-35 °C for several hours. Filter-aid (Cellflock, 1.0 g) is added and stirring is continued for additional 30 min. The charcoal is removed by filtration on a filter-aid to obtain a clear solution and the solvent is evaporated at 30-35 °C under reduced pressure, to obtain (E)-(3R,5S)-7-[2-Cyclopropyl-4-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-quinolin-3-yl]-3,5-dihydroxy-hept-6-enoic acid as a white solid. For the formation of the calcium salt, the acid (2,55 g, 6.05 mmol) is suspended in water (40,5 mL) and sodium hydroxide (0.260 g, 6.5 mmol) is added to obtain a clear solution of the corresponding sodium salt. A solution of calcium chloride (0.399 g, 3.49 mmol) in water (2 mL) is added dropwise to the solution of the sodium salt. A suspension is formed immediately upon addition of calcium chloride. The suspension is stirred for 4 hours at 20-25 °C and for 2 hours at 15-17˚C. The product is isolated by filtration, the filter cake is washed with cold water and dried in vacuo at 20-25 °C to obtain<br><br>
(E)-(3R,5S)-7-[2-CyclopropyM-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-quinolin-3-yl]-3,5-dihydroxy-h acid, calcium salt as a white, crystalline powder, comprising 10.6 % (w/w) water. [α]D20= +22.92˚- (1:1 acetonltril / water, c = 1). X-ray analysis revealed the presence of the crystal modification A. The ratio of the enantiomer having (3S, 5R) configuration was below the detection limit of 0.05 % according to column electrophoresis. The product had more than 99.7 area% purity according to HPLC and comprised 0.09 area% of the corresponding epimers (sum of both the (3S,5S) and (3R,5R) epimers, which were not separated in HPLC), The corresponding lactone could not be detected at a detection limit of 0.05 area%.<br><br>
according to the procedure described above for the preparation of (E)-(3R,5S)-7-[2-Cyclopropyl-4-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-quinolin-3-yl]-3,5-dihydroxy-hept-6-enoicicacid. After completion of the hydrolysis, excess sodium hydroxide is neutralised by addition of hydrochloric acid and the solvent is evaporated under reduced pressure. As a work-up variant, the residue is dissolved in water at 60-70 °C and the solution is allowed to cool down to room temperature. Crystallisation occurs. The formed suspension is cooled down to 5 °C, stirred for several hours at this temperature to complete the crystallisation and the product is isolated by filtration. (E)-(3R,5S)-7-[3-(4-Fluoro-phenyl)-1-isopropyl-1H-indol-2-yl]-3,5-dihydroxy-hept-6-enoic acid sodium salt is obtained as beige to yellow crystalline product.<br><br>
The crystalline product can be dissolved in water and lyophilised to obtain a lyophilisate, which is soluble in organic solvents, e.g. in dichloromethane. [α]D = -20° (c= 0.8 in dichloromethane). The acid component of the salt is identical to the acid component of Fluvastatin® in none-chiral HPLC. IR and MS spectra of the product confirmed the proposed structure and were in accordance with published data for (E)-(3R,5S)-7-[3-(4-Fluoro-phenyl)-1-isopropyl-1HHndol-2-yl]-3,5-dihydroxy-hept-6-enoic acid sodium salt (see Tempkin et al., Tetrahedron 1997, 53,10659.10670),<br><br>
