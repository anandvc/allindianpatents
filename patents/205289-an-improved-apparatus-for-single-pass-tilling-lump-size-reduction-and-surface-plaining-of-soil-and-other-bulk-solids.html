				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to an improved apparatus for single-pass tilling, lump size reduction and surface plaining of soil. More particularly, this invention pertains to a single machine or apparatus that is able to carry out all three abovementioned operations of tilling, lump size reduction and surface plaining of soil and/or other bulk materials in a single-pass, thereby doing away with the need of using two or three attachments seperately, as had been the known practice. Thus, the apparatus of the present inventionresults in considerable reduction in time, labour and energy-related cost savings as compared to known art.<br>
Agriculture is known to mankind since pre-historic times. Tilling of land, size reduction of the lumps of soil after tilling, and surface plaining are essential pre-requisites before sowing of seeds, or transplanting the crop, as may be the case. Such processes of tilling, lump size reduction and plaining were traditionally undertaken manually. Added power for these processes was later derived from domestic animals like horses, mules or bullocks. With the advent of petrol and diesel engines, tractors and power-tillers are gaining in popularity as prime movers for the processes of tilling, lump-size reduction and surface plaining.<br>
The modern plough attachment in tractors employs multiple point ploughing tools. This was able to achieve tilling and lump size reduction as a simultaneous operation, as the proximity of the tilling tips automatically controlled the lump size of the tilled soil. This has considerably reduced the need of spending long hours in breaking up the soil lumps manually, as had been the traditional practice. Addtionally, the modern day tilling apparatus, being of all-steel construction, provided a far more tough and efficient alternative to its wood and steel, single point predecessers.<br>
However, the present day tilling attachment has hitherto not been able to combine the last process of surface plaining along with the steps of tilling and lump size reduction. To this day, surface plaining is undertaken as a seperate step, with the aid of a different tool. Traditionally, this tool used to be of a wooden construction, pulled by animals. This is being gradually replaced by all-steel plaining attachment used with tractorrs and power tillers, but as already<br>
-2-<br><br>
mentioned, surface plaining remains a process essentially seperate, and serially following the processes of tilling and lump size reduction of serial and other bulk materials. The apparatus of the present invention primarily aims to combine all the three operations of tilling, lump size reduction and surface plaining into virtually simultaneous operations, using just one combined apparatus, undertaken in one pass.<br>
The major drawbacks in a conventional apparatus, which the novel apparatus of the present invention aims to overcome or improve upon are :<br>
a)	A conventional apparatus for tilling, lump size reduction and surface<br>
plaining of soil and other bulk material makes use of either two or three<br>
seperate attachments to the prime mover, which require an equivalent<br>
number or a plurality of passes ;<br>
b)	A conventional apparatus for tilling and/or lump size reduction is<br>
normally driven from one side, which causes unwanted vibration, wear<br>
and tear of the apparatus, necessitating maintenance and repair work at<br>
frequent intervals ;<br>
c)	The tilling action in a conventional apparatus induces reaction which<br>
causes the apparatus to vibrate and shake without control during operation,<br>
thereby affecting the life and quality thereof ;<br>
d)	Proper aeration of soil during lump size reduction is often not<br>
achieved due to lack of repeatibility, or control of the process, or due to<br>
improper design of the apparatus ;<br>
e)	Adequate control of depth is often not achievable in a conventional<br>
apparatus, which adversely affects the quality of tilling ;<br>
f)	Separate passes of tilling, lump size reduction and surface plaining,<br>
serially in order, requires more time, labour and energy, when compared<br>
to the instant process that is virtually simultaneous, and performed in a<br>
single pass ;<br>
-3-<br><br><br>
g) A conventional apparatus is often not protected adequately against dirt, mud, moisture and other external agents from entering the driving mechanism, eventually jamming or breaking some vital component (s) therein necessitating replacement of component parts ;<br>
h) Uncontrolled vibration, as mentioned in (c) above, may result in increased wear and tear, and lead to frequent changing of components, or overhauling and<br>
i) Constructional features of a conventional apparatus often make it cumbersome to replace components, spares and tools, whenever required.<br>
The novel apparatus of the present invention aims at overcoming the drawbacks of the prior art technologies and equipments and achieve improvement in the aspects of quality, labour and energy cost savings, reliability, replacability, maintainability and servicability as compared to the prior art.<br>
The principal object of this invention is to provide an improved apparatus for single-pass tilling, lump size reduction and surface plaining of soil and other bulk solids.<br>
A further object of this invention is to provide an improved apparatus as above, wherein the attachment is positioned such so as to considerably reduce or eliminate reactive, uncotrolled up and down movement of the head during tilling.<br>
A still further object of this invention is to provide an apparatus which incorporates automatic control of depth of tilling.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a novel apparatus which is able to achieve lump size reduction with sufficient uniformity and aeration resulting in better quality of soil preparation.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide an apparatus wherein the surface plaining is achieved in a uniform and controlled manner.<br>
-4-<br><br>
Another further object of this invention is to provide an apparatus that is uniformly loaded and powered to reduce vibration, wear and tear of the components.<br>
Another still further object of this invention is to provide an apparatus that is well protected against dust, dirt, grits, moisture, and other similar foreign matter.<br>
A still further object of this invention is to provide an apparatus with easily interchangeable tools which enables tilling, lump size reduction and surface plaining of different types of soil under varying superincumbent conditions.<br>
One other object of this invention is to provide a novel apparatus wherein replacement of one or more component (s) can be easily accomplished with minimum disturbance of other properly functional part (s).<br>
Yet one other object of this invention is to provide a novel apparatus that result in considerable savings in time and costs over conventional methods and equipments.<br>
The foregoing aims and objectives are achieved by an improved apparatus for single-pass tilling, lump size reduction and surface plaining of soil, which comprises in combination :<br>
a)	a bottom shaft sub-assembly, having a plurality of quickly<br>
interchangable blades for tilling ;<br>
b)	two transmission boxes with chain covers, one on each side of the<br>
assembly, housing both the top and bottom shaft sub-assemblies, as well<br>
as chains, sprockets, chain tensioning sprockets, bearings, retainers and<br>
specially designed triple seals ;<br>
c)	a top shaft assembly consisting of a tail crown gear box sub-assembly<br>
with crown gear and pinion, bearings, retainers, covers and two top shaft<br>
at the output ends of the gearboxes, supported at the other ends by the<br>
said transmission boxes ;<br>
-5-<br><br>
d)	two universal couplings with an intermediate connector, which serves<br>
to connect the power output transmission shaft of the tractor or tiller to<br>
the crown pinion of the top shaft sub-assembly ;<br>
e)	a hydraulically operated hinging mechanism which is capable of<br>
lifting the apparatus for disengaging or lowering the same for engaging for<br>
tilling, consisting of two hydraulic cylinders, valves and piping connected<br>
to the hydraulic power pack output of the tractor or tiller ;<br>
f)	an adjustible mud guard, covering the apparatus from above and<br>
sides, with the trailing end modified to serve as the plaining tool;<br>
g)	two depth adjusting mechanisms which enable the tilling apparatus<br>
to till accurately upto a predeterminded depth, and<br>
h) requisite supports, connecting members, stiffening members and covers for imparting necessary strength, stiffness, support, functionality and manuverabiliry to the said apparatus.<br>
The transmission of power and motion to the apparatus of this invention are achieved by mechanical and hydraulic means as follows :<br>
a)	The apparatus is lifted or disengaged from the ground, and lowered<br>
or engaged to the ground by hydraulic means. Two hydraulic cylinders,<br>
one on each side, are extended and contracted to achieve the desired<br>
position. The hydraulic cylinders are connected by means of piping and<br>
valves to the output of the hydraulic powerpack, normally in built with a<br>
tractor or a power tiller. The powerpack is normally operated through a<br>
lever within the reach of the driver or operator for suiably lifting or lowering<br>
the mechanism.<br>
b)	The depth adjusting mechanism of the apparatus of this invention<br>
is manual. However, suitable hydraulic, electronic, electrical or a<br>
combination of sensing and control systems, consisting of sensors and<br>
feedback servo or stepper control mechanisms may be incorporated as<br>
improved variations.<br>
-6-<br><br>
c)	The mud-guard position is also similarly adjustible in relation to<br>
the tilling mechanism, as has been described in (b) above, and may be<br>
equipped with similar sensing and feedback control mechanisms.<br>
d)	The rotary power to the tiller mechanism is provided by the Power<br>
Transmission Output shaft (hereinafter referred to as P.T.O. shaft) of the<br>
tractor or trailer. The rotary motion of the P.T.O. shaft is directly transmitted<br>
through the universal joints and connector sub-assembly   to the crown<br>
pinion of the crown gearbox. The crown pinion in turn rotates the crown<br>
gear assembly, and the motion is transferred through the two top shafts,<br>
one at each output of the crown gearbox, to the driving sprockets on the<br>
transmission box. The sprockets drive the chains, which impart the rotary<br>
motion to the driven sprockets at both ends of the bottom shaft assembly.<br>
The bottom shaft thus rotates with the tilling tools, resulting in tilling the<br>
soil or bulk solid medium.<br>
A novelty in the apparatus of this invention lies in incorporation of the surface plaining tool in the mud-guard, which was hitherto unknown. The mud-guard height may be adjusted with respect to the tilling mechanism either manually, or by remote sensing using electronic, electrical or hydraulic means, or any combination thereof. Also, while tilling wet soil where surface planing is not required, the mud guard can be easily shifted to a disengaged position.<br>
Another important feature of the apparatus of this invention is the depth controller. These are two supports of reference, one at each end of the tilling mechanism, with respect to which the entire tilling mechanism can be positioned accurately at the required depth. This may be achieved either manually, or using hydraulic, pneumatic, electronic or electrical means, or suitable combinations thereof.<br>
Another improvement of the apparatus of this invention over prior art mechanisms is the incorporation of drive from both sides. This results in a balanced transmission of power, and consequently, uniformity of operations, resulting in substantially less wear and tear. The crown gearbox may be of a suitable bevel or hypoid gear design, and differential mechanism may be<br>
-7-<br><br>
incorporated therein to ensure uniform tilling on both sides during turning the prime mover. Further variations in the transmission system may be an (all-gear design', incorporation of Zero back-lash' technology, mechanical or electronic synchronisation of the two sides of the drive, to name a few.<br>
Yet another novel improvement is the positioning of the tilling mechanism. In the prior art, the tilling apparatus is almost in a straight line with the P.T.O. shaft of the prime mover, which caused the tilling head to jump up and down during tilling due to reaction load from the soil, resulting in non-uniform tilling depth. The apparatus of this invention overcomes this drawback by positioning the tilling mechanism at a suitable forward angle with respect to the P.T.O. shaft. This imparts a downward pressure to the bottom shaft during tilling, thereby preventing reactive up and down movement, resulting in unifom tilling depth.<br>
The tilling tools are shaped for maximum tilling efficiency* and spaced, both radially and axially on the bottom shaft, to ensure efficient soil lump size reduction while tilling. By increasing the speed of rotation of the bottom shaft by varying the speed of the P.T.O. shaft, sufficient aeration can also be achieved during tilling and lump size reduction. Incorporation of compressed air through axial holes, ports or recesses in the bottom shaft may also be incorporated to assist the process. The tilling tools can be engaged to or disengaged from the bottom shaft by any suitable quick-change mechanism. Material of the tilling tool may be of any suitable grade of steel, or combinations of suitable grades of steel, and the tips may additionaly be coated, overlayed or bonded with ferrous, non-ferrous or ceramic hard material. The size, shape and profile of the tilling tools, individually or in combination, may be varied to suit different conditions for tilling and lump size reduction of soil and other bulk solids.<br>
The apparatus of the invention will be more particularly described with the help of the drawings accompanying this specification.<br>
A schematic general assembly of the tilling and lump size reduction attachment, showing all drive arrangements is provided in the drawing of Fig. A, and a side view of the apparatus of the present invention, highlighting the<br>
-8-<br><br>
positions of the plaining tool and the depth control mechanisms and their movements relative to the tilling and lump size reduction attachment have been illustrated in Fig. B of the drawings. For consistency, the same component has been marked with the same serial number in both the drawings.<br>
The overall tilling and lump size reduction attachment assembly is (1), and the top shaft sub-assembly is (2). The top sprocket (3) is the driving sprocket. The crown gearbox sub-assembly, which may be either bevel or hypoid gearing, is shown as (4). The tail flange is (5), crown gearbox flange is (6) and top shaft cover with seal is (8). (9) shows the chain tension adjusting sprocket, (10) shows the coupling connector, and (11) shows the ploughing blades, which may have different shape, size, length and profile for different applications. The bottom sprockets (12) are the driven sprockets. (13) denotes the bottom shaft assembly carrying the ploughing blades and (14) is the crown gear assembly. (15) denotes the bottom hub, with adequate sealing to ward off dust, mud, water, vegetation fragments and other unwanted substances from entering the mechanism. Siumilarly, (16) is the top hub. The bearing retainer neck for the crown pinion is (17), the crown pinion is (18), and the two universal couplings are denoted by (19) and (20), respectively. (21) is the transmission box and chain cover, and (22) shows the chain, which may be simplex, duplex, multi-strand, silent chain, or any variation of chain drive. (23) is the plaining tool, (24) is the hydraulic cylinder system operating the plaining tool and (25) is the depth adjusting mechanism.<br>
The advantages achieved by the novel apparatus of this invention may be summarised as under :<br>
i) Tilling, lump size reduction and surface plaining is achieved in one pass, which leads to considerable reduction in time, labour and energy costs.<br>
ii) Proper aeration is achieved, and the soil is better prepared for further processing.<br>
iii) The forward angle of the tilling head pushes the bottom shaft down during tilling, preventing unwanted or undesirable movements along a vertical plane, i.e. up and down movement, and resulting in uniform tilling depth.<br>
-9-<br><br>
iv) Drive from both sides result in uniform transmission of power, evenness of operation and less wear and tear.<br>
v) Considerable savings in fuel is achieved due to points (i) and (iv) above.<br>
vi) The triple protection seals do not allow dust, mud, water and other unwanted external matters to enter the drive mechanism.<br>
vii) Incorporation of depth control attachment ensures tilling upto the required uniform depth.<br>
viii) The adjustible plaining tool moves automatically controlling the surface height of the tilled and plained soil.<br>
ix) The crown gear-pinion arrangement ensures uniform transmission of power to both sides.<br>
x) The assembly consists of easily replacable tools, spares and accessories, making it easy to maintain in the event of a break down, or during servicing.<br>
This invention would find extensive application in agricultiure, and process industry requiring tilling or scraping, lump size reduction and surface planing of soil and bulk solids.<br>
While the invention has been described in detail and with specific embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made therein without deviating or departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Thus the disclosure contained herein includes within its ambit obvious equivalents and substitutes as well.<br>
