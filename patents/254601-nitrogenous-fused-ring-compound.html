				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
NITROGENOUS FUSED-RING DERIVATIVES, MEDICINAL COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THE DERIVATIVES, AND USE THEREOF AS DRUGS<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to nitrogen-containing fused-ring derivatives, pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof or prodrugs thereof which are useful as medicaments, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the same and pharmaceutical uses thereof.<br>
More particularly, the present invention relates to nitrogen-containing fused-ring derivatives having an inhibitory activity in human SGLT, pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof or prodrugs thereof which are useful as agents for the prevention or treatment of a disease associated with hyperglycemia such as diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance, diabetic complications or obesity, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the same and pharmaceutical uses thereof.<br>
Background Art<br>
Diabetes is one of lifestyle-related diseases with the background of change of eating habit and lack of exercise. Hence, diet and exercise therapies are performed in patients with diabetes.  Furthermore, when its sufficient control and continuous performance are difficult, drug treatment is simultaneously performed.  In addition, it has been confirmed by large-scale clinical trial that it is necessary to practice<br>
a long-term strict control of blood sugar level so as to prevent patients with diabetes from occurring and advancing diabetic complications by receiving treatment (for example, see the following References 1 and 2) . Furthermore, many epidemiologic studies on impaired glucose tolerance and macroangiopathy show that impaired glucose tolerance as the boundary type is also a risk factor in macroangiopathy as well as diabetes. Thus, needs to improve postprandial hyperglycemia have been focused (for example, see the following Reference 3).<br>
In recent years, development of various antidiabetic agents has been progressing with the background of a rapid increase of patients with diabetes. For example, Antidiabetic agents such as biguanides, sulfonylureas, insulin sensitivity enhancers, cx-glucosidase inhibitors and the like have been employed. However, biguanides and sulfonylureas show occasionally adverse effects such as lactic acidosis and hypoglycemia, respectively. Insulin sensitivity enhancers show occasionally adverse effects such as edema, and are concerned for advancing obesity. In addition, a-glucosidase inhibitors, which delay carbohydrate digestion and absorption at the small intestine, are used to improve postprandial hyperglycemia. It has been also reported that acarbose, one of a-glucosidase inhibitors, has an effect of preventing or delaying the incidence of diabetes by applying to patients with impaired glucose tolerance (for example, see the following Reference 4). However, since a-glucosidase inhibitors do not affect elevated glucose levels by ingesting a monosaccharide<br>
of glucose (for example, see the following Reference 5), with recently changing compositions of sugars in meals, a wider range of activities inhibiting carbohydrate absorption has been desired.<br>
In recent years, research and development of new type antidiabetic agents havebeenprogressing, which promote urinary glucose excretion and lower blood glucose level by preventing reabsorption of excess glucose at the kidney (for example, see the following Reference 6) . In addition, it is reported that SGLT2 (sodium-dependent glucose transporter 2) is present in the SI segment of the kidney' s proximal tubule and participates mainly in reabsorption of glucose filtrated through glomerular (for example, see the following Reference 7). Accordingly, inhibiting a human SGLT2 activity prevents reabsorption of excess glucose at the kidney, subsequently promotes excreting excess glucose though the urine, and normalizes blood glucose level. In addition, since such agents for promoting the excretion of urinary glucose excrete excess glucose though the urine and consequently the glucose accumulation in the body is decreased, they are also expected to have a preventing or alleviating effect on obesity and a diuretic effect. Furthermore, the agents are considered to be useful for various related diseases which occur accompanying the progress of diabetes or obesity due to hyperglycernia.<br>
Furthermore, it has been known that SGLT1,<br>
sodium-dependent glucose transporter I, exists in the small intestine which controls carbohydrate absorption.  It has been<br>
also reported that insufficiency of glucose and galactose absorption arises in patients with dysfunction due to congenital abnormalities of human SGLTl (for example, see the following References 8-10) . In addition, it has been confirmed that SGLTl is involved in glucose and galactose absorption (for example, see the following References 11 and 12). Furthermore, it is confirmed that mRNA and protein of SGLTl increase and absorption of glucoses are accelerated in OLETF rats and rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetic symptoms (for example, see the following References 13 and 14). Generally in patients with diabetes, carbohydrate digestion and absorption are increased. For example, it is confirmed that mRNA and protein of SGLTl are highly increased in the human small intestine (for example, see the following Reference 15) . Therefore, blocking a human SGLTl activity inhibits absorption of carbohydrates such as glucose at the small intestine, subsequently can prevent increase of blood sugar level. Especially, it is considered that delaying glucose absorption based on the above mentioned mechanism is effective to normalize postprandial hyperglycemia.<br>
Therefore, fast development of antidiabetic agents with novel action mechanism, which have an inhibitory activity in human SGLT, has been desired to improve or solve the above-mentioned problems.<br>
Fused heterocyclic derivatives provided in the present invention are entirely novel compounds. It has not ever been reported that these derivatives have an inhibitory activities in SGLTl and/or SGLT2 and inhibit absorption of glucose and<br>
galactose at the small intestine, or are useful as agents to<br>
inhibit reabsorption of excess glucose at the kidney.<br>

Test Example 1<br>
Assay for inhibitory effects on human SGLT1 activity<br>
1)	Cloning and construction of the vector expressing human SGLT1<br>
The cDNA library was prepared for PCR amplification by reverse transcription from total RNA deprived from human small intestine (Ori gene) using oligo-dT as a primer. Using this cDNA library as a template, the DNA fragment coding 1 to 2005 bp of human SGLT1 (ACCESSION: M24847), which was reported by Hediger et al., was amplified by PCR method and inserted into the multi-cloning site of pcDNA3.1(-) (Invitrogen). The DNA sequence inserted was perfectly matched to the previously reported sequence.<br>
2)	Establishment of cell line stably expressing human SGLT1<br>
The expression vector of human SGLT1 was digested by Sea I into a linear DNA. The linear DNA was transfected into CHO-K1 cells by means of lipofection (Effectene Transfection Reagent: QIAGEN) . Neomycin resistant cell lines were selected by culture in the medium containing G418 (1 mg/mL, LIFE TECHNOLOGIES) , and then the activity against the uptake of methyl-a-D-glucopyranoside was measured by the method described below. The cell line, which showed the greatest uptake activity, was selected and designated as CS1-5-11D. CS1-5-11D cells were cultured in the presence of G418 at 200 ug/mL.<br>
3)	Measurement of the inhibitory activity against the uptake<br>
of methyl-a-D-glucopyranoside (a-MG)<br>
CS1-5-11D cells were seeded into a 96-well culture plate-<br>
at a density of 3 x 104 cells/well and cultured for 2 days, and were used in the uptake assay. Amixtureof non-labeled (Sigma) and 14C-labeled a-MG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to the uptake buffer (pH 7.4; containing 140 mM sodium chloride, 2 mM potassium chloride, 1 mM calcium chloride, 1 mM magnesium chloride, 10 mM 2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethane sulfonic acid and 5 mM tris (hydroxymethyl) aminomethane) at the final concentration of 1 mM. A test compound was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, and then appropriately diluted with distilled water. The test compound solution was added to the uptake buffer containing 1 mM a-MG, and designated as a measurement buffer. For the control group, the measurement buffer without any test compound was prepared.  For measuring the basal uptake, a basal uptake measurement buffer which contains 140 mM chorine chloride instead of sodium chloride was prepared. After removing the culture medium of CS1-5-11D cells, 180 uL of the pre-treatment buffer (the basal uptake buffer without a-MG) was added to each well and incubated at 37 °C for 10 minutes. After repeating the same treatment, the pre-treatment buffer was removed. To each well was added 75 uL of the measurement buffer or the basal uptake buffer was added and incubated at 37 °C for 1 hour. After removing the measurement buffer, cells were washed twice with 180 uL per well of the washing buffer (the basal uptake buffer containing 10 mM non-labeled a-MG) . The cells were solubilized by 75 uL per well of 0 . 2 mol/L sodium hydroxide. The cell lysates were transferred into PicoPlates (Packard), and then added 150 uL of MicroScint-40<br>
(Packard) and mixed. Radioactivity was measured by means of micro-scintillation counter TopCount (Packard) . One hundred % was set to the difference between the uptake in the control group and the basal uptake, and the uptake of methyl a-D-glucopyranoside at each drug concentration were calculated. The drug concentration, at which 50% uptake of methyl<br>
a-D-glucopyranoside was inhibited (ICso value), was calculated using logit plot. The results are shown in Table 16.<br>
