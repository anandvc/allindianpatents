				<td>PROCESS FOR PREPARATION OF 2-METHYL-l,4-NAPHTHOQUINONE Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of 2-Methyl-l,4-naphthoquinone (vitamin Ks, "menadione" ). The present invention particularly relates to a process for producing 2-Methyl-l,4-naphthoquinone which is used as antihemoragic agent and in animal feed, by the oxidation of 2-Methylnaphthalene with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of acetic acid. Background of the invention<br>
Oxidation is one of the major and industrially important processes and widely used in the synthesis of low and high volume chemicals and pharmaceutical industry. Furthermore, the traditional route of oxidation using mineral acids and inorganic oxides suffer from the disadvantages of high capital cost, reactor corrosion, formation of by product and the difficulty in the catalyst regeneration. In the recent times, scientists worldwide have been devoting their attention to the development of environmentally friendly catalysts and economically feasible routes.<br>
Oxidation of arenas is important in chemical industries, especially in agrochemical and pharmaceutical industries. Many oxidation and hydroxylation reactions were studied using zeolites and redoxmolecular sieves (Sheldon et al. Curr. Opin. Solid. State Mater. Sci. 1, 1996, 101; Sheldon et al. J. Mol. Catal. A 107, 1996, 75; Kumar et al. Synlett. 1995, 289; Arends et al. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 36, 1997, 1145).<br>
Oxidation of 2-Methylnaphthalene with a sulfuric acid solution of chromic acid was studied (Fieser, J. Biol. Chem.. 133, 1940, 391; Sheldon, Top. Curr. Chem.. 164, 1993, 21). However, in this stoichiometric oxidation about 18 kg of chromium containing waste is produced for 1 kg of product. Oxidation of 2-Methlynaphthalene was investigated in presence of acetic acid with hydrogen peroxide and methyl trioxo rhenium (Adam et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.. 33, 1994, 2475; Herrmann et al., J. Mol. Catal. A Chemical. 138, 1999, 115). Oxidation of 2-Methylnaphthalene was carried over Pd-polystyrenesulfonic acid resin in the acetic acid with hydrogen peroxide (Yamaguchi et al., Chem. Lett.. 1985, 827). Metalloporphyrin catalyzed oxidation of 2-Methylnaphthalene by potassium monopersulfate was studied (Song et al., J. Ore. Chem.. 62, 1997, 673). The oxidation of 2-Methylnaphthalene has been carried out using ammonium persulfate as an oxidizing agent in the presence of cerium (IV) ammonium sulfate and silvernitrate in an emulsified solution (Skarzewski, Tetrahedron.<br>
40, 1984, 4997). The synthesis of vitamin K3 from different starting materials like 1-naphthol, 1, 4-naphthoquinone was examined using organic oxidizing agents (Rama Rao et al. Indian J. Chem. 24 B, 1985, 233).<br>
Oxidation of 2-Methylnaphthalene using hydrogen peroxide in the presence of acid catalysts have been cooked in patents (Sugano et al. Ger. Offen DE. 2341463, 1974; Takanobu et al. Japanese kokai 77, 1977, 108959; Baba et al. Japanese kokai 76, 1976, 50147).<br>
The drawbacks of using inorganic oxidants and mineral acids as given in the referred work are: (I) Catalyst can not be reused, (ii) Disposal of acid is not environmentally safe and it is not economical, (iii) Low selectivity is frequently observed, (iv) Corrosion of the reaction vessel and reactors, (v) Not easy to handle and (vi) High inventory of the catalyst.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
The main object of the present invention is to develop low cost and ecofriendly route for the oxidation of 2-Methylnaphthalene.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of 2-Methyl-1, 4-naphthoquinone.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of 2-Methyl-1, 4-naphthoquinone, said process comprising oxidizing 2-methylnaphthalene with hydrogen peroxide in a molar ratio of 1:2 to 1:12 in the presence of acetic acid of concentration in the range of 5-17N at temperature in the range of 60-100°C for a time period of 1-3 hrs and separating the 2-methyl-l, 4-naphthoquinone so obtained.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the reaction is carried out in the absence of solid catalysts are used.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the reaction is carried out in a temperature range from 60 to 100°C.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the reaction is carried out for a period of<br>
1-3 hrs.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
The present invention provides a process for oxidization of 2-Methylnaphthalene with hydrogen peroxide in acetic acid. The reaction of the invention avoids the use of solid acid catalysts in the preparation of 2-Methyl-l, 4-naphthoquinone.<br>
The following examples are given by the way of illustration and therefore should not be construed as to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
20 ml of acetic acid was taken in 50 ml round bottom flask and I g of 2-Methylnaphthalene added and kept on a magnetic stirrer. The reaction mixture was heated to 100°C. After reaching 100°C hydrogen peroxide was added slowly and allowed the reaction mixture for 3 hrs at 100°C. The reaction mixture was analysed using a CHEJvflTO 8510 Gas Chromatography using 20 % SE-30 column coupled with flame ionization detector for product distribution.<br>
A typical Gas Chromatography - Mass spectral fragmentation pattern and Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectra of. the products, 'H NMR proves that the product obtained was 2-Methyl-I,4-naphthoquinone. The reaction was carried out using different molar ratios of 2-Methylnaphthalene to hydrogen peroxide (30%) as 1:2, 1:4, 1:6, 1:8 and 1:10. Product was analyzed and the conversion and selectivity are given in Table 1.<br>
