				<td>OXIDATION OF PROPANE TO GIVE ACRYLIC ACID USING CATALYSTS<br>
IN A MIXTURE OF CRYSTALLINE PHASES<br>
The present invention relates to the selective oxidation of propane to acrylic<br>
acid, using catalysts in a mixture of crystalline phases, and the preparation of these<br>
catalysts.<br>
The yield and selectivity of the preparation of acrylic acid from propane have<br>
often been rather limited, so that improvements are needed to increase the conversion<br>
of propane. The preparation of more active and more selective catalysts serves to<br>
remedy this problem.<br>
Patent application JP 10-330343 describes catalysts useful for preparing nitriles<br>
by oxidation of an alkane in the gas phase. These catalysts with a crystalline structure<br>
are represented by the formula MoaVbSbcXxOn and defined by their lattice<br>
parameters and diffraction angles (20). The symbol X denotes one or more metallic<br>
elements selected from Ti, Zr, Nb, Ta, Cr, W, Sn, etc. These catalysts are prepared<br>
by the addition of solutions or suspensions respectively containing an antimony<br>
source and a vanadium source, followed by the addition of a solution of suspension<br>
containing a specific quantity of molybdenum and addition of the element X in the<br>
powder or solution state. The oxides of these elements or derivatives, such as<br>
ammonium metavanadate or ammonium paramolybdate, are particularly preferred.<br>
The method leads to a precursor which is dried and calcined to give a compound of<br>
metal oxides. Two phases may be obtained during the preparation: an orthorhombic<br>
phase and a hexagonal phase. The orthorhombic phase is the anticipated phase.<br>
Catalyst performance can be improved by successive washings of the catalyst<br>
mixture obtained in order to obtain the orthorhombic phase alone.<br>
Patent application JP 7-232071 describes catalysts having a crystalline<br>
structure corresponding to a formula of the MoVTeX type. These catalysts are<br>
precalcined at 300°C. The X-ray diffraction lines indicated tend to imply the<br>
presence of an orthorhombic lattice structure.<br>
European patent application EP-A-608838 describes the preparation of an<br>
unsaturated carboxylic acid from an alkane by a vapor phase catalytic oxidation in<br>
the presence of a catalyst containing a mixed metal oxide comprising Mo, V, Te and<br>
O as essential components, and at least one element selected from the group of<br>
niobium, tantalum, tungsten, titanium, aluminum, zirconium, chromium, manganese,<br>
iron, ruthenium, cobalt, rhodium, nickel, palladium, platinum, antimony, bismuth,<br>
boron, indium and cerium, these elements being present in clearly defined<br>
proportions.<br>
European patent application EP-A-895809 and patent US 6 143 916 describe<br>
oxide based catalysts comprising molybdenum, vanadium, niobium, oxygen,<br>
tellurium and/or antimony. These catalysts are used to convert propane to acrylic<br>
acid in the presence of molecular oxygen (examples 9 and 10 of the European<br>
application). Example 9 describes the oxidation of propane using a catalyst with the<br>
formula from a gas stream comprising propane, oxygen and<br>
helium and a steam stream. Patent US 6 143 916 describes crystalline forms of these<br>
catalysts.<br>
It has now been found, this being the object of the present invention, that the<br>
mixture of several different phases of catalysts in the crystalline state could yield<br>
surprising results for the oxidation of propane to acrylic acid, in comparison with the<br>
results obtained with catalysts comprising a single phase. It has in fact been<br>
demonstrated that the choice of the phases entering into the composition of the<br>
catalyst used is a very important factor.<br>
According to the invention, a crystalline catalyst phase based on tellurium or<br>
antimony and molybdenum, preferably with a hexagonal lattice (referred to below as<br>
phase A) conferring the selectivity to the final mixture, in combination with a<br>
crystalline catalyst phase for activating the propane, can yield highly unexpected<br>
oxidation results from the standpoint of activity and selectivity. A synergistic effect<br>
can be observed in the use of the mixture of these crystalline catalyst phases.<br>
The phase based on tellurium or antimony and molybdenum, conferring<br>
selectivity to the final mixture, can be selected advantageously from the compounds<br>
of tellurium and/or molybdenum or the compounds of antimony and molybdenum<br>
with a hexagonal lattice crystalline structure (phase A) or from or<br><br><br>
The crystalline catalyst phase for conferring good selectivity either satisfies the<br>
formula:<br><br><br>
in which<br>
a is between 0.1 and 2 limits included;<br>
a' is between 0.1 and 2 limits included;<br>
b is between 0 and 1 limits included;<br>
c is between 0 and 0.2 limits included;<br>
x and y represent the quantity of oxygen bound to the other elements and<br>
depends on their oxidation states,<br>
and corresponds to a hexagonal lattice structure of which the X-ray diffraction<br>
spectrum, diffraction angles (26) measured using the copper Ka1 and Ka2 lines of as<br>
an X-ray source, with a 0.02° step, has a peak at the diffraction angle 28.2° and<br>
lattice parameters a = 0.729 (±0.02) nm x p, p being an integer from 1 to 4; c = 0.400<br>
(±0.01) nm x q, q being an integer from 1 to 2; a = 90°, y = 120°,<br>
or has a monoclinic structure <br>
The crystalline catalyst phase for activating the propane is a phase of<br>
crystallized mixed metal oxides, more particularly based on molybdenum and<br>
vanadium, such as molybdenum-vanadium mixed oxides, such as a hexagonal phase<br>
catalyst (phase A) with antimony and niobium, or an orthorhombic phase catalyst<br>
(referred to below as phase B).<br>
In particular, the crystalline phase for activating the propane satisfies the<br>
formulae (II), (IF) or (II"):<br><br>
in which<br>
d, d' and d" are between 0.93 and 1 limits included;<br>
e is between 0.05 and 1 limits included;<br>
f is between 0 and 0.5 limits included;<br>
g is between 0.05 and 0.3 limits included;<br>
h is between 0.01 and 0.2 limits included;<br>
i is between 0 and 0.5 limits included;<br>
j is between 0.05 and 0.3 limits included;<br>
k is between 0.01 and 0.2 limits included;<br>
v, w and z represent the quantity of oxygen bound to the other elements<br>
and depends on their oxidation states,<br>
it being understood that the product of formula (IF) has either a hexagonal<br>
lattice structure in which the X-ray diffraction spectrum has a peak at the diffraction<br>
angle 28.2°, and lattice parameters a = 0.729 (±0.02) nm x p, p being an integer from<br>
1 to 4; c = 0.400 (±0.01) nm x q, q being'an integer from 1 to 2; a = 90°, y = 120°, or<br>
has an orthorhombic lattice structure in which the X-ray diffraction spectrum has a<br>
peak at the diffraction angle 27.3° and lattice parameters a = 2.68 (±0.04) nm; b =<br>
2.12 (±0.04) nm; c = 0.401 (±0.006) nm x q', q' being an integer from 1 to 2; a = p =<br>
y = 90°, and it being understood that the product of formula (II") has an<br>
orthorhombic lattice structure and also has an X-ray diffraction peak at the<br>
diffraction angle 27.3° and lattice parameters a = 2.68 (±0.04) nm; b = 2.12 (±0.04)<br>
nm; c = 0.401 (±0.006) nm x q', q' being an integer from 1 to 2;; a = P = y = 90°.<br>
In the X-ray diffraction spectra of the above hexagonal or orthorhombic<br>
crystalline structures, the diffraction angles (29) are measured using the copper Ka1<br>
and Ka2 lines as an X-ray source, with a step of 0.02°.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the combination of<br>
crystalline catalyst phases is prepared in ratios from 90/10 to 15/85 by weight of the<br>
total weight of mixture, of the catalyst conferring good selectivity/catalyst for<br>
activating the propane, preferably 90/10 to 50/50 by weight of the total weight of<br>
mixture, and particularly preferred, from 70/30 to 50/50 by weight of the total weight<br>
of mixture, of the catalyst conferring good selectivity/catalyst for activating the<br>
propane.<br>
Thus in particular, in the combination of catalysts, it is advantageous to use 10<br>
to 50% by weight of the crystalline catalyst phase for activating the propane,<br>
preferably 30 to 50% by weight.<br>
A subject of the present invention is a method for preparing acrylic acid from<br>
propane, in which a gas mixture comprising propane, steam and, optionally, an inert<br>
gas and/or molecular oxygen, is passed over a catalyst for conferring good selectivity<br>
for acrylic acid, of formula (I), (F), combined with a<br>
crystalline catalyst phase for activating the propane.<br>
Preferably, the method according to the present invention consists in passing<br>
the above gas mixture over a catalyst comprising a combination of a catalyst with<br>
formula (I), (I'), and a crystalline catalyst phase of formula<br>
(II), (II') or (II").<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, acrylic acid is prepared<br>
from propane using a catalyst comprising a combination of crystalline phases in<br>
ratios from 90/10 to 15/85 by weight of the total weight of mixture, of the catalyst<br>
conferring good selectivity/catalyst for activating the propane, preferably 90/10 to<br>
50/50 by weight, and particularly preferred, from 70/30 to 50/50 by weight of the<br>
total weight of mixture, of the catalyst conferring good selectivity/catalyst for<br>
activating the propane.<br>
Preferably, according to the method of the present invention, when operating in<br>
the presence of molecular oxygen, the propane/molecular oxygen molar ratio in the<br>
initial gas mixture is equal to or greater than 0.5. A molecular ratio equal to or<br>
greater than 0.3 may also be advantageous.<br>
The present invention further relates to the use of a combination of catalysts<br>
with a crystalline structure of formula (I), or (I'), Te2MoO7 or Te0.2MoOx with<br>
catalysts of a crystalline structure of formulae (II), (IF) or (II") for activating the<br>
propane, for preparing acrylic acid from propane.<br>
The method according to the invention simultaneously provides good<br>
selectivity for acrylic acid and a high propane conversion. Furthermore, it can be<br>
implemented easily in a fixed bed, fluidized bed or moving bed, and the reactants can<br>
be injected into the reactor at various points, so that the operation remains outside the<br>
flammability zone while producing a high propane concentration, and in<br>
consequence, high catalyst productivity. The unconverted propane can be recycled.<br>
According to a particularly advantageous embodiment, the method according<br>
to the invention comprises the following steps:<br>
I/ In the absence of molecular oxygen<br>
If the initial gas mixture contains no molecular oxygen, the propane is oxidized<br>
by the following redox reaction (A):<br><br>
II/ In the presence of molecular oxygen<br>
a) the initial gas mixture is introduced into a reactor with a moving<br>
catalyst bed;<br>
b) the gases are separated from the catalyst at the outlet of the first<br>
reactor;<br>
c) the combination of catalysts is sent to a regenerator; and<br>
d) the regenerated catalyst issuing from the regenerator is reintroduced<br>
into the reactor.<br>
According to another advantageous embodiment of the invention, the method<br>
comprises the repetition, in a reactor provided with the combination of catalysts, of<br>
the cycle comprising the following successive steps:<br>
1) injection of the gas mixture as previously defined;<br>
2) injection of steam and, if applicable, inert gas;<br>
3) injection of a mixture of molecular oxygen, steam and, if applicable, inert<br>
gas; and<br>
4) injection of steam and, if applicable, inert gas.<br>
It is understood that step 1) can be carried out in the form of multiple<br>
injections.<br>
According to an improvement of the advantageous embodiment just described,<br>
the cycle comprises an additional step that precedes or follows step 1) and during<br>
which the gas mixture corresponding to that of step 1) is injected, but without<br>
molecular oxygen, the propane/molecular oxygen molar ratio then being calculated<br>
on the whole for step 1) and this additional step.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment of the improvement just described,<br>
the additional step precedes step 1) in the cycle.<br>
Other features and advantages of the invention are described in greater detail<br>
below.<br>
Detailed description of the method of the invention<br>
According to the invention, in the alternatives in which molecular oxygen is<br>
introduced, since the propane/molecular oxygen molar ratio in the initial gas mixture<br>
is preferably equal to or greater than 0.5 or equal to or greater than 0.3, the<br>
conversion of propane to acrylic acid using the catalyst is carried out by oxidation,<br>
probably by the following competing reactions (A) and (B):<br>
- the conventional catalytic reaction (B):<br><br>
- and the redox reaction (A) mentioned above:<br><br>
The propane/steam volume ratio in the initial gas mixture is not critical and<br>
may vary within wide limits.<br>
Similarly, the proportion of inert gas, which may be helium, krypton, a mixture<br>
thereof, or nitrogen, carbon dioxide, etc., is also not critical and may also vary within<br>
wide limits.<br>
The proportions of the components of the initial gas mixture are generally as<br>
follows (in molar ratios):<br>
propane/oxygen/inert gas or<br>
preferably 1/0.5-2/1-10/1-10<br>
Even more preferably, they are 1/0.1-1/1-5/1-5.<br>
Even more preferably they are 1/0.167-0.667/2-5/2-5. The following<br>
proportions are also particularly advantageous: 1/0.2-0.4/4-5/4-5.<br>
In general, reactions (A) and (B) are conducted at a temperature of between<br>
200 and 500°C, preferably between 250 and 450°C, even more preferably between<br>
350 and 400°C. The pressure in the reactor or reactors is generally 1.01x104 to<br>
1.01 x106 Pa (0.1 to 10 bar), preferably 5.05x104 to 5.05x105 Pa (0.5-5 bar).<br>
The residence time in the reactor is generally between 0.01 and 90 seconds,<br>
and preferably between 0.1 and 30 seconds,<br>
Preparation of catalysts<br>
The crystallized catalysts of formulae (I), (F), or<br>
[formulae (II), (II'), (II") can be prepared by various methods, such as hydrothermal<br>
[synthesis, coprecipitation or,solid-solid reaction.<br>
Some of them can be prepared in particular by the methods described in patent<br>
US 6 143 916, in Japanese patent application JP 10-330343, in J. of Solid State<br>
Chemistry, 129, 303 (1997); Acta Chemica Scandinavica, 26, 1827 (1972); Applied<br>
Catalysis, A: General, 244, 359-70 (2003); or described by L.M. Plyasova et al,<br>
Kinetica i Kataliz, 31(6), 1430-1434 (1990); by A. Kaddouri et al, J. Therm. Anal.<br>
Cal, 66, 63-78 (2001); by J.M.M. Millet et al, Appl, Catal., 232, 77-92 (2202). They<br>
can also be prepared as described below in the examples.<br>
In general, the sources of the various metals used as raw materials are often<br>
oxides, but are not necessarily limited to oxides. In a nonlimiting manner, the<br>
following raw materials can be used:<br>
• in the case of molybdenum, ammonium molybdate, ammonium<br>
paramolybdate, ammonium heptamolybdate, molybdic acid,<br>
molybdenum halides and oxyhalides such as MoCl5, organometallic<br>
compounds of molybdenum such as molybdenum alkoxides such as<br>
Mo(OC2H5)5, acetylacetone molybdenyl;<br>
• in the case of tellurium, the tellurium, telluric acid, TeO2;<br>
• in the case of antimony, for example, antimony oxide (antimony<br>
trioxide), particularly the senarmontite variety, antimony sulfate<br>
(Sb2(SO4)3) or an antimony chloride (an antimony trichloride, antimony<br>
pentachloride);<br>
• in the case of vanadium, ammonium metavanadate, vanadium halides<br>
and oxyhalides such as VCl4, VCl5 and VOCl3, organometallic<br>
compounds of vanadium such as vanadium alkoxides such as<br>
VO(OC2H5)3;<br>
• in the case of niobium, niobic acid, niobium tartrate, niobium<br>
hydrogenoxalate, ammonium oxotrioxalate niobiate {(NH4)3[NbO-<br>
(C2O4)3], 1.5H2O}, niobium ammonium oxalate, niobium oxalate or<br>
tartrate, niobium halides or oxyhalides such as NbCl3, NbCl5 and<br>
organometallic compounds of niobium such as niobium alkoxides such<br>
as Nb(OC2H5)5, Nb(O-n-Bu)5;<br>
and, in general, all compounds suitable for forming an oxide by calcination, that is,<br>
metal salts of organic acids, metal salts of inorganic acids, complex metallic<br>
compounds, etc.<br>
One mode for preparing catalysts consists in mixing, with stirring, aqueous<br>
solutions of niobic acid, oxalic acid, and ammonium heptamolybdate, ammonium<br>
metavanadate, telluric acid or antimony oxide, and preferably precalcining the<br>
mixture in air at about 300-320°C, and calcining under nitrogen at about 600°C. ,<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, one method for preparing catalysts<br>
consists in preparing a solution of niobic acid and oxalic acid, preparing a solution of<br>
molybdenum, vanadium, tellurium or antimony, mixing the two solutions to form a<br>
gel, followed by drying of the gel obtained, precalcination and calcination.<br>
According to a particularly preferred method, the catalyst can be prepared by<br>
the following steps:<br>
1) dissolution in water of a vanadium source, for example, ammonium<br>
metavanadate, with stirring and, optionally, heating;<br>
2) if applicable, addition to the above solution of a source of tellurium or<br>
antimony, for example, telluric acid, or antimony oxide (particularly the senarmontite<br>
variety);<br>
3) addition of a molybdenum source, for example ammonium<br>
heptamolybdate;<br>
4) reaction of the solution obtained, under reflux;<br>
5) if applicable, addition of an oxidant such as hydrogen peroxide in the<br>
case of antimony catalysts;<br>
6) if applicable, addition of the solution, prepared by mixing, with<br>
heating, a niobium source, for example niobic acid, with oxalic acid;<br>
7) reaction of the reaction medium under reflux and preferably under<br>
inert atmosphere, until a gel is obtained;<br>
8) drying of the gel obtained;<br>
9) preferably, precalcination of this gel; and<br>
10) calcination of the gel, precalcined if necessary, to obtain the catalyst.<br>
In the alternatives to the above methods:<br>
drying [for example in step 8)] can be carried out in an oven as a thin layer, by<br>
spray drying, by freeze drying, by zeodration, by microwaves, etc;<br>
precalcination can be carried out under air flow at 280-300°C or under static air<br>
at 320°C, in fluidized bed, in a rotary furnace in an aerated fixed bed, so that the<br>
catalyst particles are separated from one another to prevent them from joining during<br>
precalcination or possibly during calcination;<br>
calcination is preferably carried out under very pure nitrogen and at a<br>
temperature close to 600°C, for example in a rotary furnace or in a fluidized bed and<br>
for a period of up to 2 hours.<br>
According to a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention,<br>
precalcination is carried out:<br>
- either at a temperature below 300°C under an air flow of at least 10 ml/min/g<br>
of catalyst;<br>
- or at a temperature of between 300 and 350°C under an air flow of less than<br>
10 ml/min/g of catalyst.<br>
According to a particularly preferred embodiment, precalcination is carried out:<br>
- at about 320°C under an air flow of less than 10 ml/min/g; or<br>
- at about 290°C, under an air flow of about 50 ml/min/g.<br>
According to another method for preparing catalysts, a solid-solid reaction is<br>
carried out by mixing the metal sources followed by co-grinding to obtain a uniform<br>
mixture. The solid is obtained after heating under reduced pressure at a temperature<br>
close to 600°C.<br>
Advantageously, metal oxides or the metal itself are used as the metal source.<br>
Preferably, the heating is carried out for a prolonged period (preferably 3 days to 1<br>
week).<br>
The catalysts prepared by the methods described above may each be produced<br>
in the form of particles generally from 20 to 300 microns in diameter, the particles of<br>
each of the combined catalysts generally being mixed before carrying out the method<br>
according to the invention. The particles can be obtained by spray-drying a gel or a<br>
suspension.<br>
The combination of catalysts may also be in the form of a solid catalytic<br>
composition comprising particles each of which comprises both of the catalysts.<br>
Catalyst Regeneration<br>
During the redox reaction (A), the catalysts undergo a reduction and a<br>
progressive loss of their activity. When the catalysts are at least partially in the<br>
reduced state, they are regenerated by the reaction (C):<br><br><br>
by heating in the presence of oxygen or a gas containing oxygen at a temperature of<br>
250 to 500°C, for the time necessary to reoxidize the catalysts.<br>
The proportions of the components of the regeneration gas mixture are<br>
generally as follows (in molar ratios):<br>
oxygen/inert gas (He-Kr)/H2O (steam) = 1/1-10/6-10<br>
Preferably, they are 1/1-5/0-5. .<br>
Instead of using oxygen alone, dry air (21% O2) can be used. Instead of or in<br>
addition to steam, moist air can be used.<br>
The regeneration temperature is generally 250 to 500°C.<br>
The method is generally carried out until the catalyst reduction rate is between<br>
0.1 and 10 g of oxygen per kg of catalyst.<br>
This reduction rate can be monitored during the reaction by the quantity of<br>
products obtained. The equivalent quantity of oxygen is calculated. It can also be<br>
monitored by the exothermicity of the reaction. The reduction rate can also be<br>
tracked by the quantity of oxygen consumed in the regenerator.<br>
After regeneration, which can be carried out under temperature and pressure<br>
conditions identical to or different from those of reactions.(A) and_(B), the catalysts<br>
recover an initial activity and can be reintroduced into the reactor.<br>
Reactions (A) and (B) and regeneration (C) can be carried out in a<br>
conventional reactor, such as a fixed bed reactor, a fluidized bed reactor, or a moving<br>
bed reactor.<br>
Thus, reactions (A) and (B) and regeneration (C) can be carried out in a two-<br>
stage device, that is, a reactor and a regenerator which operate simultaneously, and in<br>
which two feeds of the catalyst combination alternate periodically.<br>
Reactions (A) and (B) and regeneration (C) can also be carried out in the same<br>
reactor, by alternating the reaction and regeneration periods.<br>
Preferably, reactions (A) and (B) and regeneration (C) are carried out in a<br>
moving catalyst bed reactor, particularly in a vertical reactor, with the catalyst<br>
preferably moving upward.<br>
An operating mode with a single pass of the gases or with gas recycling can be<br>
used.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the propylene produced and/or the<br>
unreacted propane are recycled (or returned) to the reactor inlet, that is, they are<br>
reintroduced at the reactor inlet, in a mixture or in parallel with the initial mixture of<br>
propane, steam and, optionally, inert gas(es).<br>
The present invention has the great advantage of combining very good<br>
selectivity for acrylic acid and good propane conversion, because of the combination<br>
of catalysts employed and the synergistic effect procured. In this synergistic effect, it<br>
may be observed, on the one hand, that each catalyst considered separately is less<br>
efficient than the combination of the catalyst for procuring good selectivity with the<br>
catalyst for activating the propane and, on the other hand, that the selectivity<br>
observed is higher than the additive effect procured by the two catalysts considered<br>
separately, in nearly all cases. This effect can be observed in particular in the tests<br>
discussed below.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The following examples illustrate the present invention but without limiting its<br>
scope.<br>
In the examples below, the selectivities and the propane conversion are defined<br>
as follows:<br><br><br>
The selectivities relative to the other compounds are calculated similarly.<br>
