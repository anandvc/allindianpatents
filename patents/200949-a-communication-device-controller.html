				<td>A COMMUNICATION DEVICE CONTROLLER BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates a communication device controller andmore specially to a communication device been settled in the field where electrical signal is more stronger and using telephones to send / receive cellular phone could achieve the functions of using cellular phones instead of telephones in the field where hard to set up wires of telephones and amplifying a plurality of extensive phone indoor.<br>
Description of the prior art<br>
Following the technology changing with each pa.ssing day, communicative skill advancing day-by-day and government policy liberating, the communicative quality of cellular phone has been improved by way of setting station widely. Populations of using cellular phone increase by exponentially rate, meanwhile the fee cost of cellular phone relatively lower than that was.<br>
[Before cellular phones using as communication tools, every<br>
1<br><br>
home or individual user must apply to the communication system providers for wiring telephones lines from station or divider to the user terminal. In the city, the telephones net has been developed preferably, so that to set telephones lines is easily and quickly. Nevertheless, in the wild area, especially in secluded area, it will cost long period to wire telephones lines and connect the user terminals and the communication system providers.<br>
After developing cellular phones, for sake of convenient and wireless characteristics, it attracts many persons quickly. Especially, in contrast to conventional telephones, mobile system overcomes the defects of long-distance wire and set up of telephones system. However, one cellular phone do not have extensive function for other users.<br>
Furthermore, the mountains, high buildings and other wave generators usually influence the communicative signal of cellular phones from the station.<br>
US 5333177 provides a universal physical and electrical connection to a plurality of different kinds of hand-held cellular telephone units. A selectable adapter cable coding permits determination of the unique identity of the type of attached phone thereby allowing a data processing unit or the like to establish appropriate electrical interfacing support operations.<br>
Unlike US 5333177 the present invention relates to a communication device controller which is capable of signal processing and their communication to various outlets including computers and telephones and is provided with signal receive/send unit as well as signal processing unit. The device of present invention also has power supply unit to provide it with stable power for locations where constant power supply is not easy to avail.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
A primary object of the present invention is to provide a communication device controller, wherein by way of setting<br>
2<br><br>
said communication device controller in the field where electrical signal is more stronger and using telephones to send / receive cellular phone could achieve the functions of using cellular phones instead of telephones in the field where hard to set up wires of telephones and amplifying a plurality of extensive phone indoor.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a communication device controller, wherein said communication device controller could be connected to the computers and faxes through telephones lines and achieve the functions of surfing Internet and transmitting digital dates.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The structure and the technical means adopted by the present invention to achieve the above and other objects can be best understood by referring to the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments and the accompany ing drawings, wherein<br>
Fig.l shows the structure diagram of the present invention; fig.2 shows the block diagram of the present invention;<br>
3<br><br>
Fig.3 shows the use of the present invention. Fig.4 shows another use of the present invention DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Please refer to Fig.l and Fig. 2 that show the structure diagram and the block diagram of the present invention, respectively. As those shown, the communication device controller of this present invention possesses a outer part having a SIM socket (11) and a plurality of outlets (12), which could be plugged by telephones terminals and a inner part at least comprising of:<br>
a signal receive / send unit (13), being connected to said SIM socket (11) and possessing an antenna (131), which is a communication.mediator for signal send / receive unit (13) and mobile-systems and furthermore possesses a variety of communicat ion functions a-s-well-as cellular phones ;<br>
a signal process unit (14), being the mediator between a plurality of outlets (12) and said signal .send / receive unit (13 and capable of transforming signals from outlets<br>
4<br><br>
(12} to signals of cellular phone and then signals may be sent by said antenna {131} of said signal receive / send unit (13); and also capable of transforming signals from said signal send / receive unit (13) to signals of telephones and then deliver to outlets (12) ; and<br>
a power supply unit (15}, being capable of providing stable power to said signal send / receive unit (13) and said signal process unit (14),<br>
Please refer to Fig.3 that shows the use of the present invention, wherein the outlets (12) of the communication device controller (1) are connected to the telephones (3) via telephones lines (2) . After plugging the SIM card into the SIM socket (11}, the user's cellular phone could have the advantages of extensive function as wP 1 1 ^s telephones, so that one cellular phone could be use by multiple persons .<br>
Besides, users just need to set the communication device controller (1} on the place, which could receive the signal of mobile system well, and then they could use the telephones in the basement or other places where the signal is weak or may be influenced by electronic noise, so that users by way of using this present invention will get high quality<br>
5<br><br>
of voice communication.<br>
Furthermore, the communication device controller (1) isalso connected to computer (4) and fax (5), so that users could surf the Internet through computer (4 ) and use fax (5) to transmit; documents or information to another fax with wireless cellular phone : besides, as Fig. 4 shown, the communication device controller  (1)  could be directly connected to telephone and becomes a telephone machine (6) and that could receive the signal from the mobile system. Those outlets  (12) of telephone machine  (6) could be connected to telephones (3), computers (4) and fax (5).<br>
As mentioned above, we use the communication device controller (1) to connect the cellular phone and telephones and it will get thewell communicative quantity and extensive function of wire-telephones and the convenient properties of the mobile system of cellular phone simultaneously.<br>
6<br><br>
