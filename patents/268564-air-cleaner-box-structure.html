[Sununary of The Invention]<br>
[Problems that the Invention is to Solve]<br>
[0004]<br>
Here, in the prior art, the bosses are arranged outside the side wall and hence, a shape of the side wall is liable to become complicated due to the bosses whereby it is desirable to take the appearance of the air cleaner casing into consideration. On the other hand, when the bosses are arranged inside the side wall, there may be a case where the flow of air in the air cleaner casing is impeded. [0005]<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to ensure the smooth flow of air in an air cleaner casing while enhancing the appearance of the air cleaner casing in the air cleaner box structure which includes bosses for mounting a casing cover on an outer peripheral portion of a casing body.<br>
[Means for Solving the Problem] [0006]<br>
As a method for solving the problems, the invention called for in claim 1 is characterized in that, in the air cleaner box structure in which an intake chamber (for example, an air cleaner casing 51 in an embodiment) having a suction port (for example, an intake port 61 in the<br><br>
embodiment) and an outlet port (for example, a discharge port 62 in the embodiment) includes a chamber body (for example, a casing body 54 in the embodiment) which has an opening on one side thereof and a cover (for example, a casing cover 55 in the embodiment) which closes the opening (for example, an opening 54a in the embodiment) of the chamber body, the chamber body includes a bottom wall (for example, a bottom wall 56 in the embodiment) which is positioned on a side opposite to the opening, and a side wall (for example, a side wall 57 in the embodiment) which is raised from an outer periphery of the bottom wall toward an opening side, and a mating portion (for example, a mating portion 66 in the embodiment) for alignment with the cover is formed on a distal-end periphery of the side wall, and bosses (for example, bosses 71a to 71f in the embodiment) for fastening the cover to the chamber body are formed in the vicinity of the mating portion, the bosses are arranged more inwardly in the casing than the side wall, and ribs (for example, ribs 73 in the embodiment) which extend from each boss, gradually approach the side wall, and have distal ends thereof connected to the side wall are formed on a casing-inner-side of the side wall.<br>
The invention called for in claim 2 is characterized in that end portions of the ribs on a boss side are connected to a side surface of each boss on a side opposite<br><br>
to the side wall out of side surfaces of each boss.<br>
The invention called for in claim 3 is characterized in that the cover includes a cover bottom wall (for example, a cover bottom wall 58 in the embodiment) which faces the opening in an opposed manner and a cover side wall (for example, a cover side wall 59 in the embodiment) which is raised from an outer periphery of the cover bottom wall toward an opening side, and cover-side bosses (for example, cover-side bosses 72a to 72f in the embodiment) and cover-side ribs (for example, cover-side ribs 74 in the embodiment) which face the bosses and the ribs respectively are formed on a casing-inner-side of the cover side wall.<br>
The invention called for in claim 4 is characterized in that the rib and the cover-side rib are arranged such that a gap (for example, a gap S3 in the embodiment) is formed between an end portion of the rib and an end portion of the cover-side rib.<br>
The invention called for in claim 5 is characterized in that a wall plate (for example, a guide wall 68 in the embodiment) which allows a flow passage of air directed toward the outlet port from the intake port to be routed along the side wall is formed in the inside of the intake chamber, and the bosses (for example, bosses 71b, 71c, 72b, 72c in the embodiment) including the ribs are arranged on an outer peripheral side of the route-around flow passage<br><br>
for example, a route-around flow passage R2 in the<br>
mbodiment).<br>
Advantage of the Invention]<br>
,0007]<br>
According to the invention called for in claim 1, the side wall and, eventually, the outer peripheral side of the Intake chamber can be formed into a smooth shape and hence, It is possible to enhance the appearance of the intake chamber. Further, by providing ribs which gradually approach the side wall along the side wall from the boss arranged inside the side wall, it is possible to make the air which flows along the side wall in the intake chamber flow smoothly in the periphery of the boss thus ensuring the smooth air flow in the inside of the intake chamber. Further, the boss can be reinforced by the ribs and hence, it is possible to suppress strength and a size of the boss to necessary minimums.<br>
According to the invention called for in claim 2, air which flows along the side wall in the intake chamber easily gets over the boss and hence, it is possible to allow air in the intake chamber to flow more smoothly.<br>
According to the invention called for in claim 3, it is possible to allow air in the inside of the intake chamber to flow further smoothly.<br>
According to the invention called for in claim 4, a<br><br>
space which is formed between each rib and the side wall can be used as a resonator and hence, it is possible to reduce an intake sound.<br>
According to the invention called for in claim 5, by routing air which flows in the inside of the intake chamber, dusts or the like in air easily fall in the inside of the intake chamber. Further, by arranging the bosses having the ribs on an outer peripheral side of the route-around flow passage where air flows more densely, it is possible to enhance an advantageous effect that the flow of air in the intake chamber can be made smooth.

[Mode for carrying out the Present Invention] [0009]<br>
Hereinafter, an embodiment of the present invention is explained in conjunction with drawings. In the explanation made hereinafter, the directions "front", "rear", "left" and "right" are identical with corresponding directions of a vehicle unless otherwise specified. Further, in the drawing, an arrow FR indicates a front side of the vehicle, an arrow LH indicates a left side of the vehicle, and an arrow UP indicates an upper side of the vehicle.<br><br>
[0010]<br>
A scooter-type motorcycle (scooter-type vehicle) 1 shown in Fig. 1 and Fig., 2 includes a front wheel WF which is steered by a bar handle 12, and a rear wheel WR which is driven by a swing unit P. Steering system parts including the bar handle 12 and the front wheel WF are steerably and pivotally supported on a head pipe 13 mounted on a front end of a vehicle body frame F. A front lower portion of the swing unit P is pivotally supported on a lower rear portion of the vehicle body frame F in a vertically swingable manner. A straddle portion having a relatively low height is defined between the bar handle 12 and a saddle-ride seat 30 which is supported on a rear portion of the vehicle body and on which a rider sits. On both left and right sides of the straddle portion, left and right step floors 45 on which the rider sitting on the seat 30 places his feet are provided. [0011] '<br>
The vehicle body frame F is formed by integrally joining plural kinds of steels by welding or the like. The vehicle body frame F is mainly constituted of: the head pipe 13 which is positioned at a front end portion of the vehicle body frame F; a piece of main frame 14 which extends obliquely in the downward and rearward direction from the head pipe 13 and, thereafter, is bent in the<br><br>
rearward direction at a lower side of a front portion of a vehicle body, and extends in the rearward direction; a cross frame 15 which extends in the lateral direction at a rear side of a lower portion of the vehicle body and has a rear end portion of the main frame 14 joined to an intermediate portion thereof in the lateral direction; left and right rear frames 16 which extend obliquely in the upward and rearward direction from left and right side portions of the cross frame 15 and, thereafter, are bent in the rearward direction at an upper side of a rear portion of the vehicle body and extend in the rearward direction; and left and right pivot brackets 17 which are joined to left and right side portions of the cross frame 15. [0012]<br>
The swing unit P is a swing-type power unit which is an integral body formed of an engine E which constitutes a front portion thereof and a power transmission mechanism M which constitutes a rear left portion thereof. The front portion of the swing unit P is vertically swingably supported on the left and right pivot brackets 17 by way of suspension links 18. A rear cushion 19 is interposed between a rear portion of the power transmission mechanism M and a longitudinally intermediate portion of the left rear frame 16 thus constituting a unit-swing-type rear suspension on a rear portion of the vehicle body.<br><br>
[0013]<br>
The engine E (internal combustion engine) has a cylinder thereof projected frontward from a front end portion of a crankcase thereof in a substantially horizontal posture (in detail, in a slightly frontwardly raised posture). On a left side portion of the crankcase, a front portion of the casing of the power transmission mechanism M which extends rearward is integrally formed.<br>
A rear wheel axle is mounted on a right side of a rear portion of the power transmission mechanism M in a projecting manner toward a right side (vehicle-body center side), and the rear wheel WR is supported on the rear wheel axle. A rotational force of the engine E is transmitted to the rear wheel axle by way of the power transmission mechanism M so as to drive the rear wheel WR thus enabling traveling of the motorcycle 1. [0014]<br>
A carburetor (or throttle body) 27 is arranged above the cylinder, and an air cleaner box 28 is arranged behind the carburetor 27. Outside air which is introduced in and is filtered by the air cleaner box 28 turns into an air-fuel mixture after passing through the carburetor 27 and, thereafter, the air-fuel mixture is supplied to the engine E. An exhaust pipe 29 extends obliquely downward from a lower portion of the cylinder and is bent and extends in<br><br>
the rear direction, and the exhaust pipe 29 is connected to a silencer 29a which is arranged on a right side of the rear wheel WR. [0015]<br>
An article storage box 24 which is supported on a front portion of the rear frame 16 is arranged above the engine E, and a fuel tank 25 which is supported on a rear portion of the rear frame is arranged behind the article storage box 24. The article storage box 24 and the fuel tank 25 are covered with a tandem-type rider's seat 30 from above. A front end of the rider's seat 30 is connected to a front-end upper potion of the article storage box 24 by way of a hinge 31. The rider's seat 30 is rotatably supported on the article storage box 24 by way of the hinge 31 such that a rear portion of the rider's seat 30 can be moved upwardly. By rotating the rider's seat 30 upwardly, a rider can get access to the article storage box 24 and the fuel tank 25. [0016]<br>
The vehicle body frame F and a portion of the power unit P are covered with a vehicle body cover 40. The vehicle body cover 40 includes a synthetic-resin-made front cover 42 having a leg shield 41 for covering leg portions of a rider sitting on the rider's seat 30 from a front side, a floor cover 43 which is connected to a rear portion of a<br><br>
lower end of the leg shield 41 for allowing the rider to put his legs thereon, and a synthetic-resin-made rear coveT-44 which is connected to an upper portion of a rear portion of the step floor 45 so as to cover a portion of the power unit P, the article storage box 24 and the fuel tank 25 from a side. On the rear cover 44, the rider's seat 30 which is supported on the article storage box 24 by way of the hinge and is in a closed state is mounted. [0017]<br>
The floor cover 43 is formed by contiguously connecting a floor side cover 46 to both sides of the steo floor 45 on which the rider puts his feet, and is made of metal (for example, steel plate) . In this embodiment, the floor cover 43 is formed by contiguously connecting the step floor 45 and the floor side covers 46 which respectively constitute separate parts to each other. However, the floor cover 43 may be formed of an integral body constituted of the step floor 45 and the floor side covers 46. [0018]<br>
The rear cover 44 is rotatably supported on a hinge portion 71 which is interposed between rear ends of the rear frame 16. Accordingly, in a state where the rider's seat 30 is opened so that supporting and fixing of the article storage box 24 to a front portion of the rear frame<br><br>
16 is released, by rotating the rider's seat 30 which is mounted on the rear cover 44 and the article storage box 24 which is connected to the rider's seat 30 together with the rear cover 44, an upper portion of the power unit P can be opened. Here, in a cross frame 20 which extends between front portions of the rear frame 16 of the vehicle body frame F, a rod 47 which supports the rider's seat 30 and the rear cover 44 at an upper rotary position is mounted in a storable manner. [0019]<br>
The air cleaner box 28 is fixedly supported right above the power transmission mechanism on a left side of the rear portion of the vehicle body. In a state where the rear cover 44 is rotated downwardly, the air cleaner box 28 is substantially covered with the rear cover 44. On the other hand, in a state where the rear cover 44 is rotated upwardly as described previously, the whole air cleaner box 28 is exposed to the outside and hence, the maintenance of the air cleaner box 28 can be performed. [0020]<br>
As shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, the air cleaner box 28 is mainly constituted of a hollow-box-shaped air cleaner casing (intake chamber) 51, a cylindrical air cleaner element (hereinafter, simply referred to as an element) 52 which is accommodated in the air cleaner casing 51, and a<br><br>
connecting tube 53 which extends toward the throttle body<br>
27 from the air cleaner casing 51.<br>
[0021]<br>
The air cleaner casing 51 is made of a synthetic resin, and has the dividable structure consisting of a casing body 54 which constitutes a right portion of the air cleaner casing 51 positioned on a laterally inner side (on an inner side in the vehicle-width direction) and a casing cover 55 which constitutes a left portion of the air cleaner casing 51 positioned on a laterally outer side (on an outer side in the vehicle-width direction). [0022]<br>
To explain the air cleaner box 28 also in conjunction with Fig. 5, the air cleaner casing 51 is divided into the casing body 54 and the casing cover 55 along a dividing surface B which is bent laterally outwardly in a convex shape as viewed in a top plan view. The casing cover 55 is formed with a depth smaller than a depth of the casing body 54 in the vehicle-width direction (lateral direction). The casing body 54 and the casing cover 55 are opened in an opposedly facing manner, and the casing body 54 and the casing cover 55 are detachably joined to each other using a plurality of small bolts S in a state where respective opening edges are aligned with each other. [0023]<br><br>
The casing body 54 is constituted of a bottom wall 56 which constitutes an inner-side wall portion in the vehicle-width direction and a side wall 57 which is raised from an outer periphery of the bottom wall 56 toward an outer side in the vehicle-width direction.<br>
A longitudinally intermediate portion of the bottom wall 56 forms a side wall portion 56a which substantially orthogonally intersects with the lateral direction. A front portion of the side wall portion 56a forms a front inclined portion 56b which is inclined such that the more front side the front inclined portion 56b, the more outside in the vehicle-width direction the front inclined portion 56b is positioned. A rear portion of the side wall portion 56a forms a rear recessed portion 56c which is displaced toward an outer side in the vehicle-width direction for avoiding the rear cushion 19. [0024]<br>
To explain this embodiment in conjunction with Fig. 6, the side wall 57 is formed of a continuous body constituted of: a first side wall 57a which is formed on a front upper portion of the casing body 54 in a rearwardly and downwardly inclined manner; a second side wall 57b which extends upwardly from a rear end of the first side wall 57a substantially orthogonal to the first side wall 57a as viewed in a side view; a third side wall 57c which extends<br><br>
rearwardly from an upper end of the second side wall 57b while being bent (toward an outer side of the casing) in an upwardly convex shape; a fourth side wall 57d which extends downwardly from a rear end of the third side wall 57c, a fifth side wall 57e which extends frontwardly from a lower end of the fourth side wall 57d; and a sixth side wall 57f which extends upwardly toward a front end of the first side wall 57a from a front end of the fifth side wall 57e while being bulged frontwardly in a convex shape; [0025]<br>
A circular intake port 61 is formed in the second side wall 57b (see Fig. 3 and Fig. 8) . Outside air which is introduced into the air cleaner casing 51 from the intake port 61 flows in an upper rear space formed in the air cleaner casing 51 obliquely in the downward and rearward direction along the third side wall 56c, returns downwardly and turns frontwardly in a space formed on an inner side of a rear portion of the casing, and flows in a space formed on an inner side of a lower portion of the casing frontwardly. Then, outside air passes through the element 52 accommodated in an inner side of a front portion of the casing from an outer peripheral side to an inner peripheral side of the element 52 so that outside air is filtered.  In Fig. 6, an arrow F indicates a flow passage of outside air in the air cleaner casing 51. On a casing<br><br>
inner side of the intake port 61, a guide cylinder 61a made of a flexible material such as rubber, for example, is mounted (see Fig. 3). [0026]<br>
To explain this embodiment in conjunction with Fig. 4, the element 52 is housed in the inside of a front portion of the air cleaner casing 51. Here, the element 52 has an axis thereof arranged substantially horizontally, and the axis of the element 52 is inclined such that the more front side, the more inside in the vehicle-width direction the axis of the element 52 is positioned. A circular discharge port 62 is formed in a front inclined portion 56b of the bottom wall 56 of the casing body 54 (see Fig. 6 and Fig. 8), and one axial end side of the element 52 is mounted on a casing-inner side of the discharge port 62 by way of an element holder 52a. An inner peripheral side of the element 52 is communicated with the outside of the casing by way of the discharge port 62. [0027]<br>
To explain this embodiment in conjunction with Fig. 4, a rear end portion (upstream end portion) of the connecting tube 53 which is made of the flexible material such as rubber, for example, is fitted in and held by the discharge port. 62. The connecting tube 53 extends obliquely toward a front inner side of the discharge port 62 and, thereafter.<br><br>
is bent and extends frontwardly, and is connected to a rear end portion (upstream end portion) of the carburetor 27 which is positioned in front of the air cleaner casing 51 and inside the air cleaner casing 51 in the vehicle-width direction. Outside air which passes through the element 52 and is filtered is supplied to the engine by way of the discharge port 62, the connecting tube 53 and the like. [0028]<br>
To explain this embodiment in conjunction with Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, the casing cover 55 is formed into a curved shape as a whole along the dividing surface B as viewed in a top plan view. The casing cover 55 includes a cover bottom wall 58 which constitutes a side wall portion on an outer side in the vehicle-width direction and a cover side wall 59 which is raised from an outer periphery of the cover bottom wall 58 toward the outer side in the vehicle-width direction.<br>
The cover bottom wall 58 is bent along the dividing surface B. On the other hand, the cover side wall 59 is formed in an overlapping manner with the side wall 57 as viewed in a side view so as to be aligned with the side wall 57 of the casing body 54. The cover side wall 59 is formed of a continuous body constituting of first to sixth cover side walls 59a to 59f which correspond to the side walls 57a to 57f respectively.<br><br>
[0029]<br>
On a portion of the casing cover 55 which constitutes a front upper side of the casing cover 55 and is arranged above the first cover side wall 59a and in front of the second cover side wall 59b, an intake upstream outer side wall 63 having an outer peripheral shape obtained by extending a front portion of the third cover side wall 59c and an upper portion of the sixth cover side wall 59f respectively as viewed in a side view is formed.<br>
On the other hand, on a portion of the casing body 54 which constitutes a front upper side of the casing body 54 and is arranged above the first side wall 57a and in front of the second side wall 57b, an intake upstream inner side wall 64 which faces the intake upstream outer side wall 63 in an opposed manner at an intermediate portion of the casing body 54 in the vehicle-width direction is formed (see Fig. 6) . A front portion of the third side wall 57c and an upper portion of the sixth side wall 57f, as viewed in a side view, extend along an outer peripheral shape of the intake upstream inner side wall 64 more inside the intake upstream inner side wall 64 and are intersected with each other. [0030]<br>
Due to such a constitution, in a state where the casing cover 55 is mounted on the casing body 54, a space<br><br>
(pre-chamber) Tl which is surrounded by the respective side walls 57a, 57b and the respective cover side walls 59a, 59b and the inner and outer side walls 63, 64 is formed-directly in front of the intake port 61 on an upper front side of the air cleaner casing 51 as well as outside the air cleaner casing 51 in the vehicle-width direction (see Fig. 3) . Here, the intake upstream outer side wall 63 has an inner peripheral portion thereof formed in an outwardly bulging manner in the vehicle-width direction for increasing a capacity of the pre-chamber Tl as viewed in a side view (see Fig. 9) . An eaves portion 65 having an L shape as viewed in a side view which is constituted of an extending portion of the third side wall 57c and a portion of an extending portion of the sixth side wall 57f is provided above the pre-chamber Tl (see Fig. 6). [0031]<br>
To explain this embodiment in conjunction with Fig. 5 ' and Fig. 6, with respect to the opening 54a formed on a left side of the casing body 54, a mating portion 66 for mounting the casing cover 55 on the casing body 54 in a sealed state (hermetic state) is continuously formed on distal-end peripheries (left peripheries) of the respective side walls 57a to 57f over the whole circumference of the opening 54a. The mating portion 66 extends along a periphery of the opening 54a and has a U-shaped cross<br><br>
section which opens leftwardly (toward a casing cover 55<br>
side).<br>
[0032]<br>
On the other hand, To explain this embodiment in conjunction with Fig. 5 and Fig. 7, with respect to the opening 55a formed on a right side of the casing cover 55, a cover-side mating portion 67 which corresponds to the mating portion 66 is continuously formed on distal-end peripheries (right peripheries) of the respective cover side walls 59a to 59f over the whole circumference of the opening 55a. The cover-side mating portion 67 extends along a periphery of the opening 55a, and has a U-shaped cross section which opens rightwardly (toward a casing body 54 side). [0033]<br>
In the inside of the respective mating portions 56, 67, a sealing material is disposed. For example, by fitting the cover-side mating portion 67 into the mating portion 66 by displacing the cover-side mating portion 67 toward an outer peripheral side by an amount corresponding to a thickness of a distal-end flange of the cover-side mating portion 67, the opening 54a of the casing body 54 and the opening 55a of the casing cover 55 are joined to each other in a sealed state thus forming an intake chamber T2 in the inside of the air cleaner casing 51 in a hermetic<br><br>
state. [0034]<br>
Air (outside air) which is introduced in the air cleaner casing 51 (intake chamber T2) from the intake port 61 flows obliquely in downward and rearward direction in an upper rear space (upstream flow passage Rl) formed in the air cleaner casing 51 along the third side wall 56c, impinges on the fourth and fifth side walls 56d, 56e in a rear inner space (route-around flow passage R2) formed in the casing and flows in the downward direction and then turns in the frontward direction, and flows in the frontward direction in a lower inner space (downstream flow passage R3) formed in the casing (see an arrow F). Outside air passes through the cylindrical element 52 from an outer peripheral side to an inner peripheral side thereof on a front inner side of the casing so that outside air is filtered and, thereafter, outside air is supplied to the engine E side by way of the discharge port 62, the connecting tube 53 and the like. [0035]<br>
Here, To explain this embodiment in conjunction with Fig. 3, Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, a guide wall 68 which guides the flow of outside air flowing toward the discharge port 62 from the intake port 61 such that outside air is routed along the third to fifth side walls 57c to 57e is formed on<br><br>
a vertically intermediate portion of the air cleaner casing 51. Due to the provision of this guide wall 68, the inner space of the air cleaner casing 51 is divided into an upstream flow passage Rl where outside air flows obliquely in the downward and rearward direction above the guide wall 68, a route-around flow passage R2 where outside air is routed such that outside air turns from the downward direction to the frontward direction in a space behind a rear end of the guide wall 68, and a downstream flow passage R3 in which the air flows in the frontward direction in a space below the guide wall 68. [0036]<br>
The guide wall 68 is constituted of a body-side guide wall 68a which is raised from the bottom wall 56 of the casing body 54 toward a casing inner side and a cover-side guide wall 68b which is raised from the bottom wall 58 of the casing cover 55 toward the casing inner side. The guide wall 68 is formed in a state where the guide wall 68 extends from an intersecting position of the first and second side walls 57a, 57b to a longitudinally intermediate position between the second and fourth side walls 57b, 57d as viewed in a side view and is arranged substantially parallel to the third side wall 57c in a spaced-apart manner from the third side wall 57c in the downward direction.<br><br>
[0037]<br>
As shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 5, the cover-side guide wall 68b is arranged in a state where the cover-side guide wall 68b is displaced obliquely in the downward and frontward direction from the body-side guide wall 68a with a predetermined gap SI therebetween. Further, distal end sides of the respective guide walls 68a, 68b raised from the bottom walls 56, 58 are arranged to overlap with each other by a predetermined amount of S2 in the raised direction. [0038]<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, Fig. 6 and Fig. 8, on an inner side of the casing body 54 (an inner peripheral side of the side wall 57), first to sixth cylindrical bosses 71a to 71f which extend along the vehicle-width direction are formed respectively. The first boss 71a is formed on a casing inner side of an intersecting portion of the first and second side walls 57a, 57b, the second boss 71b is formed on a casing inner side of a rear portion of the third side wall 57c, the third boss 71c is formed on a casing inner side of an intersecting portion of the fourth and fifth side walls 57d, 57e, the fourth boss 71d is formed on a casing inner side of an intermediate portion of the fifth side wall 57e, and the fifth and sixth bosses 71e, 71f are formed on a casing inner side of upper and lower portions<br><br>
of the sixth side wall 57f respectively. The respective bosses 71a to 71f are provided for fastening the casing cover 55 to the casing body 54, and a tapping hole into which the small bolt S is threadedly engaged is formed in a center portion of each one of these bosses 71a to 71f. [0039]<br>
On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 3, Fig. 7 and Fig. 9, on an inner side of the casing cover 55 (an inner peripheral side of the cover side wall 59), first to sixth cylindrical cover-side bosses 72a to 72f which extend along the vehicle-width direction are formed respectively. The first cover-side boss 72a is formed on a casing inner side of an intersecting portion of the first and second cover side walls 59a, 59b, the second cover-side boss 72b is formed on a casing inner side of a rear portion of the third cover side wall 59c, the third cover-side boss 72c is formed on a casing inner side of an intersecting' portion of the fourth and fifth cover side walls 59d, 59e, the fourth cover-side boss 72d is formed on a casing inner side of an intermediate portion of the fifth cover side wall 59e, and the fifth and sixth cover-side bosses 72e, 72f are formed on a casing inner side of upper and lower portions of the sixth cover side wall 59f respectively. The respective cover-side bosses 72a to 72f are provided for fastening the casing cover 55 to the casing body 54, and an insertion<br><br>
hole which allows the insertion of the small bolt S therethrough is formed in a center portion of each one of these cover-side bosses 72a to 72f. [0040]<br>
The respective cover-side bosses 72a to 72f are formed in an overlapping manner with the respective bosses 71a to 71f formed on the casing body 54 as viewed in a side view. Distal ends of the bosses 71a to 71f and distal ends of the cover-side bosses 72a to 72f are respectively brought into contact with each other, and each boss and the cover-side boss corresponding to the boss are fastened to each other in such a contact state. [0041]<br>
To explain this embodiment in conjunction with Fig. 6, the second and third bosses 71b, 71c are positioned on an outer peripheral side of the turning flow passage. Ribs 73 which extend toward an upstream side and a downstream side of the flow passage F respectively and have distal ends thereof connected to the side wall 57 respectively are formed on each of bosses 71b, 71c in such a manner that the ribs 73 gradually approach the side wall 57 from the bosses 71b, 71c. Proximal end portions of the respective ribs 73 on a boss 71b, 71c side are connected to a side surface of the corresponding bosses 71b, 71c on a side opposite to the side wall 57 adjacent to the bosses 71b, 71c. Each rib 73<br><br>
is obliquely formed in a concave shape as viewed from the casing inner side such that each rib 73 is arranged more parallel to the side wall 57 as the rib 73 approaches the side wall 57 from the side surface of the corresponding bosses 71b/ 71c. [0042]<br>
Further, to explain this embodiment also in conjunction with Fig. 7, the second and third cover-side bosses 72b, 72c are also positioned on an outer peripheral side of the route-around flow passage R2. Cover-side ribs 74 which extend toward an upstream side and a downstream side of the flow passage F respectively and have distal ends thereof connected to the cover side wall 59 respectively are formed on each of cover-side bosses 72b, 72c in such a manner that the cover-side ribs 74 gradually approach the cover side wall 59 from the cover-side bosses 72b, 72c. Proximal end portions of the respective cover-side ribs 74 on a cover-side boss 72b, 72c side are connected to a side surface of the corresponding cover-side bosses 72b, 72c on a side opposite to the side wall 57 adjacent to the bosses 72b, 72c. Each cover-side rib 74 is obliquely formed in a concave shape as viewed from the casing inner side such that each cover-side rib 74 is arranged more parallel to the cover side wall 59 as the cover-side rib 74 approaches the cover side wall 59 from<br><br>
the side surface of the corresponding cover-side bosses 72b,<br>
72c.<br>
[0043]<br>
While the respective ribs 73 and the respective cover-side ribs 74 are formed so as to overlap with each other as viewed in a side view, as shown in Fig. 5, a predetermined gap S3 is formed between a distal end of each rib 73 raised from the bottom wall 56 and a distal end of each cover-side rib 74 raised from the bottom wall 58 in a state where the casing cover 55 is mounted on the casing body 54. Through this gap S3, a space T' which is formed between the respective ribs 73, 74 and the side walls 57, 59 is communicated with the intake chamber T2 formed in the air cleaner casing 51. [0044]<br>
As shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, the distal end portions of the respective ribs 73, 74 on a side of the side walls 57, 59 are bent toward an outer side of the casing and are connected to the side walls 57, 59 substantially orthogonally. Due to such connection of the ribs 73, 74, compared to a case where the respective ribs 73, 74 are connected to the corresponding side walls 57, 59 obliquely at an acute angle, a range where the connection portion has a large thickness can be narrowed thus suppressing the generation of shrinkage cavity. Here, such<br><br>
a connection portion is formed only for facilitating a molding operation and hence, to observe the ribs 73, 74 as a whole, the ribs 73, 74 are formed in an inclined manner such that the ribs 73, 74 gradually approach the corresponding side walls 57, 59 respectively. [0045]<br>
As has been explained heretofore, the air cleaner box structure of the embodiment is characterized in that, the air cleaner box structure in which the air cleaner casing 51 having the intake port 61 and the discharge port 62 includes the casing body 54 which has the opening on one side thereof and the casing cover 55 which closes the opening 54a of the casing body 54, the casing body 54 includes the bottom wall 56 which is positioned on a side opposite to the opening 54a, and the side wall 57 which is raised from the outer periphery of the bottom wall 56 toward the opening 54a side, the mating portion 66 for alignment with the casing cover 55 is formed on the distal-end periphery of the side wall 57, and bosses 71a to 71f for fastening the casing cover 55 to the casing body 54 are formed in the vicinity of the mating portion 66, the bosses 71a to 71f are arranged more inwardly in the casing than the side wall 57, and ribs 73 which extend from the bosses 71b, 71c, gradually approach the side wall 57 and have distal ends thereof connected to the side wall 57 are<br><br>
formed on the casing-inner-side of the side wall 57. [0046]<br>
Due to such a constitution, the side wall 57 and, eventually, the outer peripheral side of the air cleaner casing 51 can be formed into a smooth shape and hence, it is possible to enhance the appearance of the air cleaner casing 51. Further, by providing ribs 73 which gradually approach the side wall 57 along the side wall 57 from the bosses 71b, 71c arranged inside the side wall 57, it is possible to make the air which flows along the side wall 57 in the air cleaner casing 51 flow smoothly in the periphery of the bosses 71b, 71c thus forming the smooth air flow in the air cleaner casing 51. Further, the bosses 71b, 71c can be reinforced by the ribs 73 and hence, it is possible to suppress strength and a size of the bosses 71b, 71c to necessary minimums. [0047]<br>
Further, in the air cleaner box structure, the end portions of the ribs 73 on the bosses 71b, 71c side are connected to the side surfaces of the respective bosses 71b, 71c on a side opposite to the side wall 57 out of the side surfaces of the respective bosses 71b, 71c and hence, air which flows along the side wall 57 in the air cleaner casing 51 easily gets over the bosses 71b, 71c whereby it is possible to allow air in the air cleaner casing 51 to<br><br>
flow more smoothly. [0048]<br>
Further, in the air cleaner box structure, the casing cover 55 includes the cover bottom wall 58 which faces the opening 54a in an opposed manner and the cover side wall 59 which is raised from the outer periphery of the cover bottom wall 58 toward the opening 54a side, and the cover-side bosses 72a to 72f and the cover-side ribs 74 which face the bosses 71a to 71f and the ribs 73 respectively are formed on a casing-inner-side of the cover side wall 59 and hence, it is possible to allow air in the air cleaner casing 51 to flow further smoothly. [0049]<br>
Still further, in the air cleaner box structure, the rib 73 and the cover-side rib 74 are arranged such that the gap S3 is formed between the end portion of the rib 73 and the end portion of the cover-side rib 74 and hence, the spaces T' which are formed between the respective r:ibs 73, 74 and the side walls 57, 59 can be used as resonators and hence, it is possible to reduce an intake sound. [0050]<br>
Further, in the air cleaner box structure, the guide wall 68 which allows the flow passage of air directed toward the discharge port 62 from the intake port 61 to be routed along the side walls 57, 59 is formed in the inside<br><br>
of the air cleaner casing 51, and the bosses 71b, 71c including the ribs 73 and the cover-side bosses 72b, 72c including the cover-side ribs 74 are respectively arranged on an outer peripheral side of the route-around flow passage R2 and hence, by routing air which flows in the air cleaner casing 51, dusts or the like in air easily fall in the inside of the air cleaner casing 51. Further, by arranging the bosses 71b, 71c having the ribs 73 and the cover-side bosses 72b, 72c having the cover-side ribs 74 on the outer peripheral side of the route-around flow passage R2 where air flows more densely, it is possible to enhance an advantageous effect that the flow of air in the air cleaner casing 51 can be made smooth. [0051]<br>
Here, the invention is not limited to the embodiment and, for example, at least one of the intake port 61 and the discharge port 62 may be formed in the casing cover 55. Further, the casing body 54 may be arranged on an outer side in the vehicle-width direction and the casing cover 55 may be arranged on an inner side in the vehicle-width direction. Further, when the element 52 does not have a cylindrical shape and is a thick-plate-shaped panel-type element which is sandwiched between the casing body 54 and the casing cover 55, the guide wall 68 may extend from the panel type element.<br><br>
Further, the constitution in the embodiment is only one example of the present invention, and it is needless to say that the present invention is not limited to the. scooter-type motorcycle and is applicable to various kinds of vehicles, and various modifications are conceivable without departing from the gist of the present invention.
