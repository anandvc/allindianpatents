				<td>METHODS FOR SYNTHESIS OF ACYLOXYALKYL DERIVATIVES OF GABA<br>
ANALOGS<br>
Field<br>
Methods for synthesis of l-(acyloxy)-alkyl carbamates are provided. More<br>
particularly, the synthesis of prodrugs (i.e., 1-(acyloxy)-alkyl carbamates of GABA analogs)<br>
from 1-haloalkyl carbamates of GABA analogs are described. Also described are new<br>
1-haloalkyl carbamates of GABA analogs.<br>
Background<br>
One solution to drug delivery and/or bioavailability issues in pharmaceutical<br>
development is converting known drugs to prodrugs. Typically, in a prodrug, a polar<br>
functional group (e.g., a carboxylic acid, an amino group, a hydroxyl group, etc.) is masked<br>
by a promoiety, which is labile under physiological conditions. Accordingly, prodrugs are<br>
usually transported through hydrophobic biological barriers such as membranes and<br>
typically possess superior physicochemical properties than the parent drug.<br>
Pharmacologically effective prodrugs are non-toxic and are preferably selectively<br>
cleaved at the locus of drug action. Ideally, cleavage of the promoiety occurs rapidly and<br>
quantitatively with the formation of non-toxic by-products (i.e., the hydrolyzed promoiety).<br>
The acyloxyalkoxycarbonyl functionality is an example of a promoiety that may be<br>
used to modulate the physiochemical properties of pharmaceuticals (Alexander, United â€¢<br>
States Patent NO.,4,916,230 Alexander, United States Patent No, 5,733,9,07; Alexander et<br>
al, U.S. Patent No. 4,426,391). Typically, l-(acyloxy)-alkyl derivatives of a<br>
pharmaceutical possess superior bioavailability, may be less irritating to topical and gastric<br>
mucosal membranes and are usually more permeable through such membranes when<br>
compared to the parent drug.<br>
However, although l~(acyloxy)-alkyl ester derivatives of alcohols and<br>
l-(acyloxy)-alkyl carbamate derivatives of amines have been frequently used to mask these<br>
polar functional groups in pharmaceuticals, existing synthetic methods for preparing these<br>
desirable derivatives are inadequate. Methods disclosed in the art for synthesis of<br>
acyloxyalkyl esters and carbamates are typically multi-step routes that utilize unstable<br>
intermediates and/or toxic compounds or salts and accordingly are difficult to perform on<br>
large scale (Alexander, United States Patent No. 4,760,057; und, United States Patent No.<br>
5,401,868; Alexander, United States Patent ISio. 4,/60,057; Saari et ah, European Patent<br>
0416689B1).<br>
Accordingly, there is a need for a new synthesis of l-(acyloxy)-alkyl derivatives that<br>
proceeds rapidly and efficiently, which is amenable to scale-up and proceeds through<br>
readily accessible synthetic precursors.<br>
Summary<br>

"Compounds" refers to compounds encompassed by structural formulae (I) - (VIII)<br>
disclosed herein and includes any specific compounds within these formulae whose<br>
structure is disclosed herein. Compounds may be identified either by their chemical<br>
structure and/or chemical name. When the chemical structure and chemical name conflict,<br>
the chemical structure is determinative of the identity of the compound. The compounds<br>
described herein may contain one or more chiral centers and/or double bonds and therefore,<br>
may exist as stereoisomers, such as double-bond isomers (i.e., geometric isomers),<br>
enantiomers or diastereomers. Accordingly, the chemical structures depicted herein<br>
encompass all possible enantiomers and stereoisomers of the illustrated compounds<br>
including the stereoisomerically pure form (e.g., geometrically pure, enantiomerically pure<br>
or diastereomerically pure) and enantiomeric and stereoisomeric mixtures. Enantiomeric<br>
and stereoisomeric mixtures can be resolved into their component enantiomers or<br>
stereoisomers using separation techniques or chiral synthesis techniques well known to the<br>
skilled artisan. The compounds may also exist in several tautomeric forms including the<br>
enol form, the keto form and mixtures thereof. Accordingly, the chemical structures<br>
depicted herein encompass all possible tautomeric forms of the illustrated compounds. The<br>
compounds described also include isotopically labeled compounds where one or more<br>
atoms have an atomic mass different from the atomic mass conventionally found in nature.<br>
Examples of isotopes that may be incorporated into the compounds of the invention include,<br>
but are not limited to, 2H, 3H, 13C, 14C, 15N, 180,17O, etc. Compounds may exist in<br>
unsolvated forms as well as solvated forms, including hydrated forms and as N-oxides. In<br>
general, compounds maybe hydrated, solvated or N-oxides. Certain compounds may exist<br>
in multiple crystalline or amorphous forms. In general, all physical forms are equivalent for<br>
the uses contemplated herein and are intended to be within the scope of the present<br>

methods are known in the art for synthesizing GAB A analogs, which are readily accessible<br>
to the skilled artisan. Methods for synthesis of amino acid derivatives of GAB A analogs<br>
{i.e., compounds of formula (1), infra, where n = 1) are disclosed in Gallop et al,<br>
International Publication No. WO 02/100347).<br>
Accordingly, starting materials useful for preparing compounds and intermediates<br>
thereof, and/or practicing methods of the invention are commercially available or can be<br>
prepared by well-known synthetic methods. Other methods for synthesis of the prodrugs<br>
described herein are either described in the art or will be readily apparent to the skilled<br>
artisan in view of the references provided above and may be used to synthesize the<br>
compounds of the invention. Accordingly, the methods presented in the Schemes herein are<br>
illustrative rather than comprehensive.<br>
Intermediate (4) useful in the preparation of 1-haloalkyl carbamates of Formula (II)<br>
may be generated according to reactions detailed in Scheme 1.<br>
The amino group of (1) (a GAB A analog when n = 0, or an aminoacyl derivative of<br>
a GAB A analog when n = 1) is protected under standard conditions with a protecting group<br>
("Pg") to afford compound (2). The carboxylic acid moiety in (2) is esterified to yield<br>
compound (3), either (i) via alkylation with RI0-Y, where Y is halide, O3SR' (R' is alkyl,<br>
substituted alkyl, aryl or substituted aryl), or other suitable leaving group), or (ii) via<br>
condensation with alcohol R10-OH under standard acylation conditions (e.g., in the presence<br>
of a coupling agent such as a carbodiimide, via an acyl halide, acid anhydride or other<br>
activated ester intermediate). Removal of the protecting group from (3) under standard<br>
deprotection conditions affords compound (4). Preferably, when n = 0, the protecting group<br>
Pg is removable under acidic conditions and compound (4) is isolated as a salt, which is<br>
stabilized towards lactam formation relative to the corresponding free base form.<br>
tert-Butoxycarbonyl (i.e., Boc) is one preferred protecting group, and may be removed with<br>
HC1 to afford (4) as a hydrochloride salt.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, where n is 0, the hydrochloride salt of (4) is prepared<br>
directly from (1) by treatment with an excess of thionyl chloride or hydrogen chloride gas<br>
and alcohol R10-OH (Scheme 2). Typical ratios of (1) to thionyl chloride from between 1:1<br>
and 1:20, and ratios of (1) to alcohol from between 1:1 and 1:20 may be used. The reaction<br>
may be performed at temperatures between â€”20 Â°C and 25Â°C. Under conditions where the<br>
alcohol R10-OH is a liquid, the alcohol may be used as a solvent for the reaction.<br>
Alternatively, the reaction may be performed in the presence of a suitable solvent, such as,<br>
for example, dichloromethane, dichloroethane, chloroform, toluene, dimethylformamide,<br>
dimethylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidinone, or pyridine. Preferred alcohols R10-OH for this<br>
reaction are arylalkyl, substituted arylalkyl and allylic alcohols. Allyl alcohol and benzyl<br>
alcohol are particularly preferred.<br>
In one embodiment, a compound of formula (II) is prepared by acylation of (4) with<br>
compound (5) (see Scheme 3), where X is halide and Z is a leaving group (e.g., halide,<br>
/&gt;-nitrophenolate, imidazolyl, etc.). Preferably, X is Cl or Br and Z is Cl. More preferably,<br>
X and Z are both Cl. The acylation reaction may be performed in the presence of a base,<br>
including inorganic and organic bases (e.g., tertiary amine bases, such as triethylamine,<br>
tributylamine, diisopropylethylamine, dimethylisopropylamine, N-methylmorpholine,<br>
N-methylpyrrolidine, N-methylpiperidine, pyridine, 2-methylpyridine,<br>
2,6-dimethylpyridine, 4-dimethylaminopyridine, 1, 4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, 1,<br>
8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene, 1, 5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]undec-7-ene, etc.). Suitable<br>
solvents for this acylation include, but are not limited to, dichloromethane, dichloroethane,<br>
chloroform, toluene, dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidinone,<br>
dimethyl sulfoxide, pyridine, ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, acetonitrile, acetone,<br>
2-butanone, methyl tert-bntyl ether, or combinations thereof. Alternatively, biphasic<br>
solvent mixtures comprising water and one or more of dichloromethane, dichloroethane,<br>
chloroform, toluene, ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate or methyl ter*-butyl ether, may be<br>
utilized. Typical temperatures for performing this reaction are between -20 Â°C and 50Â°C,<br>
more preferably, between -20 Â°C and 25Â°C.<br>
In another embodiment, a compound of formula (II), where R10 is trialkylsilyl or<br>
aryldialkylsilyl, may be prepared directly from compound (1) by silylation (e.g., using a<br>
silyl halide or silylamide reagent) and then acylation of the resulting intermediate with<br>
compound (5) (see Scheme 4). Suitable solvents for performing this reaction include, but<br>
are not limited to, dichloromethane, dichloroethane, chloroform, toluene, pyridine, and<br>
acetonitrile. Suitable bases for performing this reaction include, but are not limited to,<br>
triethylamine, tributylamine, diisopropylethylamine, dimethylisopropylamine,<br>
N-methylmorpholme, N-methylpyrrolidine, N-methylpiperidine, pyridine,<br>
2-methylpyridine, 2,6-draiethylpyridine, 4-dimethylaminopyridine, 1,<br>
4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, 1, 8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene or 1,<br>
5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]undec-7-ene. Typical temperatures for performing this reaction are<br>
between -78 Â°C and 50Â°C, more preferably, between -20 Â°C and 25Â°C.<br>
1-Acyloxylalkyl carbamates of fonnula (I) are prepared from compounds of formula<br>
(II) by treatment with carboxylic acids of formula (III) in the presence of an organic or<br>
inorganic base, or other metal salt, as illustrated in Scheme 5. Preferred solvents, bases and<br>
other reaction conditions have been described in detail previously (see Section 4.2 above).<br>
In one embodiment, R10 is a carboxylic acid protecting group that can be removed<br>
under mild conditions to provide a compound of fonnula (I) where R10 is hydrogen.<br>
Carboxylic acid protecting groups removable via mild acidic hydrolysis, fluoride<br>
ion-promoted hydrolysis, catalytic hydrogenolysis, transfer hydrogenolysis, or other<br>
transition metal-mediated deprotection reactions are preferred. In one embodiment, R10 is<br>
trirnethylsilyl, allyl or benzyl.<br>

Example 1: Benzyl 1-AminomethvI-l-Cyclohexane Acetate Hydrochloride (6)<br>
A dry 500 mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask was fitted with a magnetic<br>
stirring bar and a 60 mL pressure-equalizing addition runnel and flushed with nitrogen gas.<br>
The flask was charged with gabapentin (17.1 g, 0.1 mol) and benzyl alcohol (128 mL, 1.18<br>
mol) and the mixture was cooled to 0Â°C with an ice-water bath. Thionyl chloride (51.8 mL,<br>
77.25 g, 0.65 mol) was added dropwise to the stirred solution over a period of 1 h. The<br>
reaction was monitored by LC/MS, with product and unreacted gabapentin hydrochloride<br>
being observed. After stirring at room temperature for 3.5 days the reaction mixture<br>
contained residual gabapentin hydrochloride (by LC/MS). Additional thionyl chloride (20<br>
mL, 30 g, 0.25 mol) was added at 0Â°C, and the reaction mixture allowed to stir at room<br>
temperature for another 12 h (LC/MS shows traces of residual gabapentin hydrochloride).<br>
A final portion of thionyl chloride (10 mL, 15 g, 0.12 mol) was added at 0Â°C and the<br>
reaction mixture allowed to stir at room temperature for 4 h (LC/MS showed no remaining<br>
gabapentin hydrochloride). The reaction mixture was then diluted with ethyl ether (200<br>
mL) and cooled to 0Â° C while stirring. White crystalline solid formed, which was collected<br>
by filtration. The crude compound was recrystallized from a mixture of ethanol and ethyl<br>
ether (50 mL: 150 mL). Finally the white crystals were washed with 250 mL of ethyl<br>
