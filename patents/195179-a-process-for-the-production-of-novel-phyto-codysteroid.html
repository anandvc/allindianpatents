As part of our continued effort to investigate bountiful flora of Sub-Himalayan region of North East India, we have isolated an unusual secondery metabolites of the structure 1 from the leaves of a tropical plant, T. baccata or T. baccata var.wallichiana. The structure of this compound has been established on the basis of (+) Fast Atom bombardment mass spectroscopy, 'H-1H COSY45, 1H-13C COSY, DEPT and ROESY NMR spectroscopy.<br>
The plant is widely used in Indian Ayurvedic [Kapoor, L.D. in Handbook of Ayurvedic system of medicinal Plants, 1990, p 317, CRC Press Inc. Boca Raton FL.] and Unani system [Vohra, S.B. and Kumar, I. Planta Medica, 1971, 20, 100.] of medicines. The plant was used in this region as timber. The young shoots of the plant is also known to be used by the local people as the treatment of headache, giddiness, feeble and falling pulse, diarrhoea, severe biliousness, spasm, hysteria, epilepsy, nervousness and calculas complaint [Vohra, S.B. and Kumar, I. Planta Medica, 1971, 20, 100; Kirtikar, K.R. and Basu,B.D. Indian Medicinal Plants, Vol III, 2nd Ed., p2383, Lalit Mohan Basu, 49, Leader road, Allahabad, India, 1933.]. The non poisonous and fleshy aril is eaten by the tribals and is credited with expectorant, carminative and stomachic properties. Extracts of J. baccata or T. baccata var.wallichiana is also known to be used in hair-lotions, shaving creams and dentrifecing agents and the decoction of leaves are used as an abortifacient [The Wealth of India, Raw Materials, Vol. X, p132; Publication and Information Directorate, CSIR, New Delhi]. The phytoecdysteroids were found to have properties like antidiabetic, anti-hypercholesterolaemic, antihyperlipidaemic, anti-atherosclerotic [ Camp, F. Plant Ecdysteroids and their interaction with insects in Chapter 14 of Ecological Chemistry and Biochemistry of Plant Terpenoids; ed. Harbourne, J.B. and Tomas Barberan F.A.; Clarendon Press; Oxford; 1991, pp331-376.] and anti-ulcer activities [ Khim. Farm. Zh. 1989, 23(4), 441-445]<br>
STRUCTURE      OF      ARUNACHALSTERONE	(CHEMICAL      NAME:       2,3,9,20,21-<br>
PENTAHYDROXY-CHOLEST-7-EN-6-ONE)<br>
The concentrated methanolic extract of air dried and powdered, previously defatted plant material<br>
of Himalayan yew (Taxus baccata or Taxus baccata var.wallichiana) collected from Arunachal Pradesh<br>
(June, 1994) on repeated  gradient flash chromatography (or column chromatography or Medium Pressure<br>
Liquid Chromatography or High Pressure Liquid Chromatography or thin layer chromatography) with<br>
hexane-ethyl acetate and chloroform-methanol gave an amorphous solid which on purification by<br>
preparative TLC (or flash chromatography or column chromatography or Medium Pressure Liquid<br>
Chromatography or High Pressure Liquid Chromatography) afforded a solid compound. This compound<br>
designated as arunachalsterone, chemical name: 2,3,9,20,2l-pentahydroxy-cholest-7-en-6-one, melting<br>
point, 220-225°C, was analyzed for C27H44O6 by elemental analysis, FABMS (+)   giving [M+]   at 464,<br>
DEPT   and   'H-13C correlated COSY.   Infra-red spectrum (KBr) of arunachalsterone, chemical name:<br>
2,3,9,20,21-pentahydroxy-cholest-7-en-6-one   showed strong absorption bands at   3420 and 1645 cm-1<br>
indicative of several hydroxyl and an A E-unsaturated carbonyl group.<br>
The 'H NMR (300 MHz ) spectrum of 1 revealed that it contained an A E-unsaturated carbonyl<br>
group (r5.78 d, J=l Hz), three proton under hydroxyls (1~"3.95 ddd, J=l,1.5 &amp; 2 Hz; 3.80 ddd, J=12.3, 1.5<br>
&amp; 1 Hz and 3.34 dd, J=9.3 &amp; 2 Hz), five hydroxyl signals ( T3.90, 3.6,   3.58, 3.25 and 2.61, all broad<br>
singlet), one allylic proton ( T3.10 ddt, J=8.7,l &amp;1 Hz ), three methyl singlets (F 1.18 s , 0.99s , 0.90 s ),<br>
two methyl doublets (r0.89 d, J=6.4 Hz and   0.81 d, J=6.3 Hz) and methylene and methine protons. The<br>
13C NMR (75 MHz) spectrum of it showed the presence of an A E-unsaturated carbonyl group ( T 202.499<br>
s, 164.338 s and 119.934 d), tertiary hydroxyls (r 82.53 s, 75.221 s) and three secondary hydroxyls ( T<br>
74.975 d, 66.248 d and   66.122 d). DEPT experiments revealed the presence of five methyls, eight<br>
methylenes, eight methines and six quarternary carbons in it. The proton carbon connectivity was<br>
determined by combined use of DEPT and 1H-13C COSY  NMR experiments.<br>
The proton proton coupling network was finally determined by 1H-1H COSY90 experiment at 300<br>
MHz. Based on the above evidences the structure of arunachalsterone, chemical name: 2,3,9,20,21-<br>
pentahydroxy-cholest-7-en-6-one was settled as 2,3,9,20,22-pentahydroxy-cholest-7-en-6-one, 1..<br>
The structure of this new 14-dehydroecdysteroid, 1_, was further confirmed by the fact that<br>
acetylation of it with acetic anhydride (Ac20) and pyridine at r.t. (24 h) gave a dihydroxy triacetate 2,<br>
C33H50O9 by elemental analysis, was supported by EIMS giving molecular ion at 590. Other major peaks in<br>
the mass spectrum are at 573, 554, 540, 526, 512, 494 and 484. The IR spectrum showed the significant<br>
reduction in intensity of the bands at 3300 cm-' and appearance of a new band at 1725 cm-'. The 'H NMR<br>
spectrum revealed one olefinic proton (T 5.88 d,   J=l Hz, H-7), three proton under acetate (r 5.35 ddd,<br>
J=l,1.5 &amp; 2 Hz;   5.06 ddd, J=12.3, 1.5 &amp; 1 Hz and 4.83 dd, J=9.3 &amp; 2 Hz), one allylic proton (r3.12 ddt,<br>
J=8.7,l &amp; 1 Hz ), two tertiary hydroxyls (r2.37 br s), three acetate (r2.116 for 6H and d 2.012 for 3H),<br>
three tertiary methyls (r 1.248 s, 1.035 s and 0.858 s) and two methyl doublets (r 0.892 d, J=6.3 Hz and d<br>
0.885 d, J=7.2 Hz). The proton proton connectivity network of this dihydroxytriacetate derivative of arunachalsterone, chemical name: 2,3,9,20,21-pentahydroxy-cholest-7-en-6-one,l was determined by a 'H-1H COSY90. The stereochemistry of arunachalsterone, chemical name: 2,3,9,20,21-pentahydroxy-cholest-7-en-6-one 1 was established by two dimensional ROESY spectrum of it. In the ROESY spectrum, the cross peaks between H-2 and H-3, H-3 and H-4a, H-7 and H-15a, H-7 and H-15b (low intensity), H-2a and H-4a, H-5b and H-19, H-21 and H-18, H-17 and H-16a, H-22 and H-21 and H-17 and H-12a revealed its stereochemistry as depicted in 1.. The absence of cross peaks in the ROESY spectrum between H-22 and H-21 indicates their trans relationship. The non-formation of cross-peaks between H-19 and H-2 and H-19 and H-3 (or between H-19 and the hydroxyls at C-2 and C-3) indicates that C-19 methyl is equatorial while C-3 and C-2 hydroxyl groups are axial and equatorial respectively. The low coupling with J2ax,3eq= 1 Hz between H-2 (r5.06) and H-3 (r5.35) also supported these observations. The stereochemistry of H-5 was assigned as E, since there is no cross peak in the ROESY spectrum between H-5 &amp; H-2 and H-5 &amp; H-3. The ROESY spectrum also enabled to assign unambiguously 'H NMR signals of arunachalsterone, chemical name: 2,3,9,20,2l-pentahydroxy-cholest-7-en-6-one, i, at T3.90 br s, 3.60 br s, 3.58 br s, 3.25 br s and 2.61 as due to the hydroxyls at C-9, C-2, C-20, C-3 and C-22 respectively.<br>
The details of the process disclosed in this invention have been described in the following specific examples which are provided to illustrate the invention only and therefore these examples should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention. Example I:<br>

Air dried and powdered needles and small branches (2 Kg) were exhaustively extracted with methanol in a soxhlet extractor for 20 h. The extract was concentrated under reduced pressure. The concentrated extract was first washed with hexane (200 ml x 3) and then with chloroform (150 ml x 6). The dried ( anhydrous Na2S04) chloroform extract was then distilled under reduced pressure to get a crude which on repeated gradient flash chromatography (or column chromatography or Medium Pressure Liquid Chromatography or High Pressure Liquid Chromatography or thin layer chromatography) with hexane-ethyl acetate and CHCI3-CH3OH gave a polar fractions from which precipitate of white amorphous powder separates on standing. These precipitates on purification by TLC (CHCI3-CH3OH, 10:1 ) (or flash chromatography or column chromatography or Medium Pressure Liquid Chromatography or High Pressure<br>
