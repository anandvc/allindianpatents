COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10] "MOTORCYCLE AIR CLEANER"<br><br><br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, having a place of business at 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
[Detailed Description of the Invention] [0001]<br>
[Technical Field of the Invention]<br>
The present invention relates to an air cleaner for a motorcycle which has a vehicle body having a feeling of slimness and smooth in appearance and is preferred to further enhance an occupant"s ease of egress and ingress. [0002] [Prior Art]<br>
As an air cleaner for a motorcycle, there is known, for example, "Air Cleaner Device of an Internal Combustion Engine for a Motorcycle" disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Publication No. 63-12074.<br>
In Fig. 2 of the above described official gazette, there is described a motorcycle in which a main pipe 2 extends from a head pipe H (for the reference numeral, one specified in the official gazette is used and so forth. ) ; in the lower part of this main pipe 2, there is mounted an air cleaner A; at this air cleaner A, there are provided air intake pipes 7, 7 for extending above the main pipe 2; an air cleaner A including these air intake pipes 7, 7 is housed within a leg shield 1; and the leg shields 1 at positions corresponding to the air intake pipes 7, 7 have been caused to bulge upwardly. [0003] [Problems to be solved by the Invention]<br>
In the above described technique specified in the official gazette, since the leg shield 1 becomes large-sized and locally bulges because of arrangement of the air cleaner A inside the leg shield 1, a feeling of slimness of the vehicle body cannot be acquired, but it can be also conceived that the<br>
2<br><br>
rider"s ease of egress and ingress might be impaired because<br>
the leg shield 1 becomes large-sized.<br>
[0004]<br>
Thus, it is an object of the present invention to obtain a vehicle body which has a feeling of slimness and is smoother in appearance by improving the air cleaner for the motorcycle and to further enhance the occupant"s ease of egress and ingress by making the height of the vehicle body cover lower. [0005] [Means for solving the Problems]<br>
In order to achieve the above described object, Claim 1 is characterized in that in a motorcycle in which a vehicle body frame extends obliquely below backward from a head pipe, an engine is mounted onto this vehicle body frame and an air cleaner is arranged above in front of this engine, the air cleaner is caused to bulge forward of a vehicle body cover for covering the vehicle body frame in such a manner that a part of the air cleaner can be seen when the vehicle body is viewed from the side. [0006]<br>
The air cleaner is caused to bulge forward of the vehicle body cover, whereby it is possible to reduce space to be occupied by the air cleaner within the vehicle body cover, and to miniaturize the vehicle body cover and there is no need for causing the vehicle body cover to locally bulge so that it becomes easier to design the vehicle body cover in shape.<br>
In addition, it is possible to reduce the width of the rear part of the vehicle body cover, and to make the height<br>
3<br><br>
lower so that a feeling of slimness of the vehicle body can be acquired and the rider"s ease of egress and ingress can be enhanced. [0007]<br>
Claim 2 is characterized in that an intake port of the air cleaner is opened turned downward and a shield plate for preventing rainwater from entering from a road surface side into the intake port is caused to project from the air cleaner.<br>
The intake port of the air cleaner is opened turned downward, whereby there is no possibility that rainwater enters the intake port from above, but the shield plate is capable of preventing rainwater from splashing from a road surface side to enter the intake port. [0008]<br>
Claim 3 is characterized in that on both sides of a front part of the air cleaner, there is provided a stand-up wall each in an up-and-down direction and between the stand-up wall and an inside portion of the air cleaner, there are provided horizontal ribs.<br>
With the provision of a plurality of horizontal ribs, it is possible to enhance stiffness of the air cleaner.<br>
Also, when the front surface of the air cleaner is viewed, the air cleaner can be given, for example, an appearance like a radiator by the plurality of horizontal ribs.<br><br>

is characterized in that both sides of the front part of the air cleaner cover 36 constituting the air cleaner 13 (See Fig. 3) are provided with stand-up walls 48, 49 in an up-and-down direction, and that between each of the stand-up walls 48, 49 and the wall surface 52 as the inner part of the air cleaner, there have been provided the horizontal ribs 47.<br>
With the provision of the plurality of horizontal ribs 47, it is possible to enhance stiffness of the air cleaner cover 36 of the air cleaner 13, and accordingly to enhance stiffness of the entire air cleaner 13. Thereby, it is possible to make wall thickness of the air cleaner 13 thinner and to reduce the weight of the air cleaner 13. [0018]<br>
Further when the front surface of the air cleaner 13, that is, the front surface of the air cleaner cover 36 is viewed, the plurality of horizontal ribs 47 are capable of giving the air cleaner 13, for example, such an appearance as a radiator, and a small - sized motorcycle (including a motor-bike) equipped with no radiator can give a new impression. [0019]<br>
Hereinafter, the description will be made of an operation of the air cleaner 13 described above.<br>
Fig. 6 is an operation view explaining an operation of the air cleaner according to the present invention.<br>
Into the intake port 41 of the air cleaner 13, air flows from below the intake port 41 as indicated by an arrow CD. [0020]<br>
For example, in the case where it is splashed from a road<br><br>
surface side toward the air cleaner 13 side, rainwater is blocked by the shield plates 42, 43 (the reference numeral 43 of the back side is not shown) provided on the air cleaner 13 as indicated by an arrow (D shown by broken line so that it does not reach the intake port 41 of the air cleaner 13.<br>
Also, even if it falls from above the air cleaner 13 as indicated by an arrow (D shown by broken line, rainwater does not enter the intake port 41 because the intake port 41 of the air cleaner 13 is opened below. [0021]<br>
As described in Figs. 3, 4 and 6, the present invention is characterized in that the intake port 41 of the air cleaner 13 has been opened turned downward and shield plates 42, 43 for preventing rainwater from entering from a road surface side into the intake port 41 have been caused to project from the air cleaner case 35 of the air cleaner 13.<br>
The intake port 41 of the air cleaner 13 has been opened turned downward, whereby there is no possibility that rainwater enters the intake port 41 from above, but the shield plate 42 is capable of preventing rainwater from splashing from a road surface side to enter the intake port 41. [0022]<br>
Also, as described in Figs . 1 and 2, the present invention is characterized in that in a motorcycle 10 in which a vehicle body frame 11 extends obliquely below backward from a head pipe 21, an engine 12 is mounted onto the vehicle body frame 11 and an air cleaner 13 is arranged above in front of this engine 12, the air cleaner 13 is caused to bulge forward of a side<br><br>
body cover 27 for covering the vehicle body frame 11 in such a manner that a part of the air cleaner 13 can be seen when the vehicle body is viewed from the side. [0023]<br>
The air cleaner 13 is caused to bulge forward of the side body cover 27, whereby it is possible to reduce space to be occupied by the air cleaner 13 within the side body cover 27, the side body cover 27 can be miniaturized and there is no need for causing the side body cover 27 to locally bulge so that it becomes easier to design the side body cover 27 in shape. [0024]<br>
Also, the air cleaner 13 has been caused to bulge forward, that is, the air cleaner 13 has been moved more forward than in the conventional case, whereby the width B of the rear part of the side body cover 27 can be made smaller as shown in Fig. 2, the height can be made lower, a feeling of slimness of the vehicle body can be acquired and the rider"s ease of egress and ingress can be enhanced. [0025] [Effect of the Invention]<br>
The present invention exhibits the following effect because of the above described structure.<br>
