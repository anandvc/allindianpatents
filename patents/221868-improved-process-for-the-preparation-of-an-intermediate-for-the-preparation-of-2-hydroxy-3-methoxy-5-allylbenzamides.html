				<td>This invention relates to an improved   method   for   the preparation of an intermediate   useful  for  the  preparation   of  benzamides.  This  invention particularly  relates  to  an  improved  method  for the  preparation  of an intermediate of the formula (I) useful for the preparation of substituted benzamides of the general formula (II) given above .<br><br>
Wherein Ri and R2 are selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, substituted and unsubstituted alkyl of one to seven carbon atoms, aryl and cycloalkyl and when taken together with the nitrogen atom form a heterocycle which may contain another heteroatom, which products possess outstanding choleretic properties.<br>
The substituted benzamides of the general formula (II) are useful as choleretic and antispasmodic agents<br>
Background of the invention<br>
A study of information contained in the US patent no 3668238 on the method of preparation of the substituted benzamides of formula (II) revealed that essentially two routes are available for the preparation<br>
The first route disclosed in the said US patent no 3,668,238 for the preparation of substituted benzamides of the general formula-(I), comprises of following steps as exemplified.<br><br>
The first route disclosed in the said US patent no 3,668,238 for the preparation of substituted benzamides of the general formula-(I), comprises of following steps as exemplified.<br>
a)	Ethyl ester of 2-hydroxy-3-methoxy benzoic acid of formula-(III-A) is<br>
treated    with    monoethanolamine    to    yield    2-hydroxy-3-methoxy-N-<br><br>
b)	The compound of the formula IV-A obtained in Step (a) is treated with<br>
allyl bromide to yield allyl ether of the formula IV-B which, insitu is<br>
converted into 2-hydroxy-3-methoxy 5-allyl-N-(p-hydroxy ethyl)-<br>
benzamide of formula-(V) by high temperature Claisen rearrangement<br>
reaction.<br><br><br>
This process is beset with the following difficulties<br>
(i)  For this process the starting material is 2-Hydroxy-3-methoxy benzoic<br>
acid    (o-vanillic acid) of formula (III-B) which is very expensive and<br>
difficult for procurement.<br>
(ii) In step(a) of the process excess ethanolamine has to be used which is not recycled thus making this process expensive<br>
(iii)For step (b) we have noticed that after allylation, the rearrangement step is very exothermic and it can pose serious problems such as an uncontrollable run-away reaction during scale-up trials.<br>
(iv)Yield is not mentioned for the compound obtained in step (b).<br>
The second route described in US Patent no 3,668,238 involves the following process.<br>
Ester of the formula (VI) on condensation with appropriate amines yielded corresponding benzamides of the formula (II) in 58-78% yields.<br><br>
Though this route is apparently straight forward with better yields when compared to the first route, we found the following draw backs in the method:<br><br>
(i) Preparation of the compound of the formula (I), (2-Hydroxy-3-methoxy-5-allyl benzoic acid) is not disclosed. Although compound of formula (I) is known in literature, its method of synthesis is not described. In this patent, the reference given for the preparation of compound of formula (II) [ J. Amer. Chem. Soc, 71, 1067 (1949)] discloses only the esterification procedure of compound of formula (II).<br>
(ii)Preparation of the ester of the formula (VI) is not possible without having a method of preparation of the corresponding acid of formula (I). Therefore this data is inadequate to implement this process<br>
Detailed discussion of the present invention<br>
Keeping in view of the difficulties in commercialization of the process disclosed in the above mentioned patent, we aimed our research work to develop a simple and cost-effective process for the preparation of the 2-hydroxy-3-methoxy-5-allyl-benzoic acid of the formula-(I) which is the key intermediate for the preparation of benzamides of the formula-(II).<br>
Therefore the main objective of the present invention is to provide an inexpensive method for an intermediate of the formula (I) useful for the preparation of benzamides of the general formula-(II)<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an inexpensive method for the preparation of the intermediate of the formula (I) useful for the preparation of benzamides of the general formula-(II) which is scalable on a commercial scale.<br><br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an inexpensive method for the preparation of the intermediate of the formula (I) useful for the preparation of benzamides of the general formula-(I) which is economical.<br>
During our sustained research to develop a simple process for the preparation of substituted benzamides of the formula-(I), we observed that a promising approach for such a processes would be to<br>
a)	Avoid the use of o-vanillic acid as the key starting material<br>
b)	Use eugenol of the formula-(VII) as the key starting material<br>
c)	Carboxylation of eugenol employing carbondioxide and anhydrous alkali to give the intermediate of the formula (II).<br>
The present invention has been developed based on our above mentioned findings to achieve the above stated objectives.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of compound of the formula (I) useful for the preparation of substituted benzamides of the formula (II).<br><br><br><br>
Which comprises solid phase carboxylation of eugenol of the formula (VII) Using carbon dioxide gas and anhydrous alkali at a temperature in the range of 150-250°C and isolating the intermediate of the formula (II) By acidification with hydrochloric acid extraction with toluene and filtration.<br><br>
The alkalis used may be selected from potassium hydrogen carbonate or potassium carbonate preferably potassium carbonate. The carbon dioxide pressure usedln the carboxylation step may be in the range of 6-12 Kg preferably in the range of 8-10 Kg. The temperature of carboxylation may be in the range of 150-250°C preferably in the range of 190-210°C<br><br>
This isolation can be carried out by standard extraction, filtration and drying* methods. For example the isolation of the intermediate of the formula(I) may be effected by dissolution of the salt cake in water, acidification of the aqueous layer extraction with toluene, and filtration of the product.<br>
The compound of the formula (I) can be used for the preparation of substituted benzamides of the formula (II) by the reaction scheme shown below.<br><br>
The process shown in the above scheme has been made the subject matter of a separate application filed simultaneously with this application.<br>
The details of the invention are given in the Examples given below which are provided to illustrate the invention only and therefore they should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention<br><br>
