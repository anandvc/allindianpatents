				<td>ENZYME AND FABRIC HUEING AGENT CONTAINING COMPOSITIONS<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION This invention relates to compositions comprising certain glycosyl hydrolases and fabric hueing agents.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Detergent manufacturers incorporate hueing agents into their laundry detergent products to impart visual fabric benefits to fabric laundered therewith. However, it has proven difficult to deliver adequate consumer acceptable visual benefits and there remains a need to improve the fabric hueing profile of these laundry detergent compositions. The Inventors have found that additionally incorporating certain glycosyl hydrolases into a laundry detergent composition that comprises a hueing agent, improves the whiteness perception and hueing profile of the composition. Without wishing to be bound by theory, the Inventors believe that these glycosyl hyrolases biopolish the fabric surface in such a manner so as to improve the deposition and the performance of the hueing agents.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to compositions comprising certain glycosyl hydrolases and fabric hueing agents and processes for making and using such products.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>

Glycosyl hydrolase<br>
The glycosyl hydrolase has enzymatic activity towards both xyloglucan and amorphous cellulose substrates, wherein the glycosyl hydrolase is selected from GH families 5,12,44 or 74.<br>
The enzymatic activity towards xyloglucan substrates is described in more detail below. The enzymatic activity towards amorphous cellulose substrates is described in more detail below.<br>
The glycosyl hydrolase enzyme preferably belongs to glycosyl hydrolase family 44. The glycosyl hydrolase (GH) family definition is described in more detail in Biochem J. 1991, v280, 309-316.<br>
The glycosyl hydrolase enzyme preferably has a sequence at least 70%, or at least 75% or at least 80%, or at least 85%, or at least 90%, or at least 95% identical to sequence ID No. 1.<br>
For purposes of the present invention, the degree of identity between two amino acid sequences is determined using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970, J. Mol. Biol. 48: 443-453) as implemented in the Needle program of the EMBOSS package (EMBOSS: The European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite, Rice et ai, 2000, Trends in Genetics 16: 276-277), preferably version 3.0.0 or later. The optional parameters used are gap open penalty of 10, gap extension penalty of 0.5, and the EBLOSUM62 (EMBOSS version of BLOSUM62) substitution matrix. The output of Needle labeled "longest identity" (obtained using the -nobrief option) is used as the percent identity and is calculated as follows: (Identical Residues x 100)/(Length of Alignment - Total Number of Gaps in Alignment).<br>
Suitable glycosyl hydrolases are selected from the group consisting of: GH family 44 glycosyl hydrolases from Paenibacillus polyxyma (wild-type) such as XYG1006 described in WO 01/062903 or are variants thereof; GH family 12 glycosyl hydrolases from Bacillus licheniformis (wild-type) such as Seq.

(wild type) such as XYG1020 described in WO 2002/077242 or variants thereof; and GH family 74 glycosyl hydrolases from Trichoderma Reesei (wild type), such as the enzyme described in more detail in Sequence ID no. 2 of WO03/089598, or variants thereof.<br>
Preferred glycosyl hydrolases are selected from the group consisting of: GH family 44 glycosyl hydrolases from Paenibacillus polyxyma (wild-type) such as XYG 1006 or are variants thereof.<br>
Enzymatic activity towards xyloelucan substrates<br>
An enzyme is deemed to have activity towards xyloglucan if the pure enzyme has a specific activity of greater than 50000 XyloU/g according to the following assay at pH 7.5.<br>
The xyloglucanase activity is measured using AZCL-xyloglucan from Megazyme, Ireland as substrate (blue substrate).<br>
A solution of 0.2% of the blue substrate is suspended in a 0.1M phosphate buffer pH 7.5, 20°C under stirring in a 1.5ml Eppendorf tubes (0.75ml to each), 50 microlitres enzyme solution is added and they are incubated in an Eppendorf Thermomixer for 20 minutes at 40°C, with a mixing of 1200 rpm. After incubation the coloured solution is separated from the solid by 4 minutes centrifugation at 14,000 rpm and the absorbance of the supernatant is measured at 600nm in a 1cm cuvette using a spectrophotometer. One XyloU unit is defined as the amount of enzyme resulting in an absorbance of 0.24 in a 1cm cuvette at 600nm.<br>
Only absorbance values between 0.1 and 0.8 are used to calculate the XyloU activity. If an absorbance value is measured outside this range, optimization of the starting enzyme concentration should be carried out accordingly.<br>
Enzymatic activity towards amorphous cellulose substrates<br>
An enzyme is deemed to have activity towards amorphous cellulose if the pure enzyme has a specific activity of greater than 20000 EBG/g according to the following assay at pH 7.5. Chemicals used as buffers and substrates were commercial products of at least reagent grade.<br>
Endoglucanase Activity Assay Materials:<br>
0.1M phosphate buffer pH 7.5<br>
Cellazyme C tablets, supplied by Megazyme International, Ireland.<br>
Glass microfiber filters, GF/C, 9cm diameter, supplied by Whatman.<br>
Method:<br>
In test tubes, mix 1ml pH 7,5 buffer and 5ml deionised water.<br>
Add 100 microliter of the enzyme sample (or of dilutions of the enzyme sample with known<br>
weight:weight dilution factor). Add 1 Cellazyme C tablet into each tube, cap the tubes and mix on<br>
a vortex mixer for 10 seconds. Place the tubes in a thermostated water bath, temperature 40°C.<br>
After 15, 30 and 45 minutes, mix the contents of the tubes by inverting the tubes, and replace in<br>
the water bath. After 60 minutes, mix the contents of the tubes by inversion and then filter<br>
through a GF/C filter. Collect the filtrate in a clean tubes.<br>
Measure Absorbance (Aenz) at 590nm, with a spectrophotometer. A blank value, Awater, is<br>
determined by adding 100µl water instead of 100 microliter enzyme dilution.<br>
Calculate Adelta = Aenz - Awater.<br>
Adelta must be 
Determine DFO.l, where DFO.l is the dilution factor needed to give Adelta = 0.1.<br>
Unit Definition: 1 Endo-Beta-Glucanase activity unit (1 EBG) is the amount of enzyme that gives Adelta = 0.10, under the assay conditions specified above. Thus, for example, if a given enzyme sample, after dilution by a dilution factor of 100, gives Adelta= 0.10, then the enzyme sample has an activity of 100 EBG/g.<br>

For purposes of the present invention, washing includes but is not limited to, scrubbing, and mechanical agitation. Accordingly, the present invention includes a method for laundering a fabric. The method comprises the steps of contacting a fabric to be laundered with a said cleaning laundry solution comprising at least one embodiment of Applicants' composition. The fabric may comprise most any fabric capable of being laundered in normal consumer use conditions. The solution preferably has a pH of from about 7 to about 11. The compositions may be employed at concentrations of from about 500 ppm to about 15,000 ppm in solution. The water temperatures typically range from about 5 °C to about 90 °C. The water to fabric ratio is typically from about 1:1 to about 30:1.<br>
TEST METHOD 1 A protocol to define whether a dye or pigment material is a fabric hueing agent for the purpose of the invention is given here:<br>
1.)    Fill two tergotometer pots with 800ml of Newcastle upon Tyne, UK, City Water (~ 12 grains per US gallon total hardness, supplied by Northumbrian Water, Pity Me, Durham, Co. Durham, UK).<br>
2)	Insert pots into tergotometer, with water temperature controlled at 30°C and agitation set at 40rpm for the duration of the experiment.<br>
3)	Add 4.8g of IEC-B detergent (IEC 60456 Washing Machine Reference Base Detergent Type B), supplied by wfk, Briiggen-Bracht, Germany, to each pot.<br>
4)	After two minutes, add 2.0mg active colorant to the first pot.<br>
5)	After one minute, add 50g of flat cotton vest (supplied by Warwick Equest, Consett, County Durham, UK), cut into 5cm x 5cm swatches, to each pot.<br>
6)	After 10 minutes, drain the pots and re-fill with cold Water (16°C) having a water hardness of 14.4 English Clark Degrees Hardness with a 3:1 Calcium to Magnesium molar ratio.<br>
7)	After 2 minutes rinsing, remove fabrics.<br>
8)	Repeat steps 3-7 for a further three cycles using the same treatments.<br>
9)	Collect and line dry the fabrics indoors for 12 hours.<br>
10)	Analyse the swatches using a Hunter Miniscan spectrometer fitted with D65 illuminant and UVA cutting filter, to obtain Hunter a (red-green axis) and Hunter b (yellow-blue axis) values.<br>
<br>
 <br>
11)   Average the Hunter a and Hunter b values for each set of fabrics. If the fabrics treated with colorant under assessment show an average difference in hue of greater than 0.2 units on either the a axis or b axis, it is deemed to be a fabric hueing agent for the purpose of the invention.<br>
