				<td>The present invention is applicable to compositions which need to be dissolved in ,an aqueous medium in an easy and fast way This technology may found application in various fields, CE., in detergent compositions like laundry detergent'compositions, soaking detergent compositions, dishwashing   compositions   or   any   other   compositions   for   houschold   applications. More particularly,   the present invention relates to granular detergent compositions intended for the cleaning of fabrics.<br>
A problem associated to conventional giauular composition1; which tuc to be used by the consumer after having been diluted typically with v/ntcr, is iheir tendency lowards poor dissolution. That tendency has been exacerbated by the recent uend in for example the detergent industry towards higher bulk density granular cojnpositions. and to ward:, gruriulnr detergent compositions which have a higher content of active ingredients,. Gianulnr dctcigent compositions of high bulk densities ranging from 650 to 1100 k£/m3 me atlra'Jtive to consumcts but not satisfactorily dissolved into an aqueous medium.<br>
Another difficulty with detergent compositions is that they me not easily flushed from the dispenser drawer of a washing macline. Similar problems LUC cnconntctcd when using such aranular detergent compositions in a dosing device in the washing drum.<br>
It is known to use cinic acid and bicatbonatc in powder coniposidons to promote diesolulioni of for example pharmaceutical preparations, In order to cnsure an uniform Jistribution of these cffcrvesccnt(matcdals in these prepatioins it is essential to utilise sodium bicnibo.nate and citric acid hi the form of fine powders. It is also nccesscuy to incoipotaic cansidoiable propoilious of<br>
P&amp;O Case CM1481M/KL<br>
these effervescent materials in the preparations in order to obtain the desired effect Furthermore, a major issue with such powder compositions is the poor storage stability when they are exposed to moisture.<br>
It is thus an object of the present invention to provide compositions with improved dissolution and/ or dispensing characteristics upon dilution in an aqueous medium, It is a further object of the present invention that the effective dissolution characteristics of the compositions of the present invention are not reduced or lost during storage.<br>
It has now been found that these objects can be met by providing a detergent composition comprising effervescence material containing an acid and a carbonate source having a specific effervescence index. Preferably, the effervescence material or at least part thereof, is comprised in a dry effervescence granule. In particular, it has been found that the objectives can thus be met by providing a granular composition obtainable by a process which comprises the step of first forming a dry effervescent granule comprising an acid, carbonate and/or bicarbonate and optionally a binder wherein the acid, carbonate and/or bicarbonate and the binder are in close physical proximity, then incorporating this granule in the granular composition. Indeed, it has been found that for example the incorporation of such preformed dry effervescent granules typically obtainable by dry-powder compaction or pressure agglomeration into the compositions according to the present invention provides improved dissolution and/ or dispensing characteristics to all the active ingredients present in the compositions and good storage stability in respect of the dissolution potential. It has been found that the compositions according to the present invention deliver enhanced effervescence'which results in improved dissolution or dispensing of the compositions, when the compositions are contacted with water (i.e., in use conditions), as compared to compositions having the same effervescence powders present at the same levels, wherein all the effervescent materials are uniformly distributed in the whole granular compositions, i.e., are two separate granular particles.<br>
Another problem associated to conventional detergent is their tendency of not always osatisfactorily meeting consumer needs in respect to the performance delivered by the active ingredients present in said compositions.<br>
Furthermore, when formulating bleach-containing detergent compositions, comprising an oxygen bleach, it is not only desirable to deliver effective stain removal performance (e.g., on bleachable stains), but importantly such compositions need also to be thermally stable .upon prolonged storage time before their actual use.<br>
It has now been found that these problems are solved by the detergent compositions of the invention, as described herein. Furthermore, it has been found that in a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the presence of the pre-fonned dry effervescent granules, as described herein, in a detergent composition comprising an active detergent ingredient, produces enhanced effervescence upon contact with water, which results in improved dissolution and / or dispensing of the composition and improved stain removal performance observed on the fabrics treated, as compared to the stain removal performance delivered in the same conditions with compositions, having the same ingredients, at the same levels, which however comprise all the effervescent materials uniformly distributed in the whole granular compositions, or with the same compositions but being free of any effervescent materials, More particularly, it has been found that the stain removal performance is even more improved due to the presence of the dry pre¬formed effervescent granules, in a detergent composition. This has also been found when the composition is used in short soaking operations, i.c. when the soiled fabrics are immersed in a soaking liquor comprising water and said composition, simultaneously or immediately after its preparation (e.g., before 5 minutes and more preferably before 1 minute after its preparation), for typically less than 30 minutes, before being removed from the soaking liquor, Advantageously, the stain removal performance improvement associated to the detergent compositions of the present invention is also even more noticeable at low usage temperatures, typically below 30 °C,<br>
Advantageously the unproved stain removal performance is observed on a variety of stains including tough outdoor dirt like greasy stains (e.g. spaghetti sauce, bacon grease), enzymatic stains (blood), bleachable stains (grass) and/or paniculate soils (mud/clay).<br>
Another advantage of the present invention is that the stain removal performance, when soaking/washing a fabric in presence of a detergent composition as described herein, is improved even in the presence of relatively high levels of hardness ions.<br>
It has now been found that compositions of the invention and the dry pre-formed effervescent granules are bleach-compatible and stable upon storage.<br>

Detailed Description of the invention<br>
The dry effervescent granule and process for its manufacturing<br>
The present invention encompasses a dry effervescent granule comprising an acid, carbonate source, preferably carbonate and/or bicarbonate, and optionally a binder wherein the acid, carbonate source and optionally the binder are in close physical proximity and a process for manufacturing the same.<br>
By "dry" it is to be understood that the granules are substantially free of water, i.e., that no water has been added or present other than the moisture of the raw materials themselves. Typically, the level of water is below 5% by weight of the total granule, preferably below 3% and more preferably below 1.5%.<br>
For the purpose of the present invention, the term close physical proximity means that the effervescent materials, i.e., the acid, and carbonate source, are in intimate admixture in the effervescent granules and may not be separated by anything else than a binder, if the binder is present in the dry effervescent granule. Preferably, according to the present invention, at least part of the acid and the carbonate are not separate discrete particles in the granular compositions.<br>
The dry effervescent granules according to the present invention comprising the effervescent materials, i.e., the acid and the carbonate source, in close physical proximity are preferably obtainable by dry-powder compaction or pressure agglomeration. While all binding mechanisms can occur in pressure agglomeration, adhesion forces between the solid particles, i.e., between the acid, carbonate source and optionally the binder if present, play an especially important role. This is because pressure agglomeration, especially high pressure agglomeration, is an essentially<br><br>
diy process that forms new entities (i.e., dry effervescent granules) from solid particles (i.e., the acid, bicarbonate, carbonate source and optionally the binder) by applying external forces to densify a more or less defined bulk mass or volume and create binding mechanisms between the solid particles providing strength to the new entity, i.e. the high external force applied brings the solid particles closely together.<br>
The dry effervescent particles results in a very fast carbon dioxide production and therefore in accelerated dispersibility and dissolution rate of the granular composition. The granular compositions of the present invention, as. described herein, comprising the dry effervescent granules allow dispensing and dissolution in water of the granular compositions in a shorter period of time and at lower total level of effervescent panicles/materials and ensure, a faster and more effective delivery of detergent ingredients to the wash.<br>
Suitable acids to be used herein include solid organic, mineral or inorganic acids, salts or derivatives thereof or a mixture thereof. It may be preferred that the acids are mono-, bi- or tri-protonic acids, Such acids include mono- or polycarboxylic acids preferably citric acid, adipic acid, glutaric acid, 3 chetoglutaric acid, citramalic acid, tartaric acid, maleic acid, fiunaric acid, malic acid, succinic acid, malonic acid. Such acids are preferably used in their acidic forms, and it may be preferred that their anhydrous forms are used, or mixtures thereof. Derivatives also include ester of the acids. Surprisingly, it has now been found that by using' tartaric, maleic and in particular malic acid as the acid in the dry efTervescent granules, said granules deliver improved physical and/or chemical stability upon prolonged storage periods. When citric acid is used it may be preferred that its level is kept .below 20% in the dry effervescent granules according to the present invention, in particular to facilitate processability and to allow appropriate storage stability of the granules.<br>
The acid is preferably present in the dry effervescent granules according to the present invention at a level of from 0.1% to 99% by weight of the total granule, preferably from 3% to 75%, more preferably from 5% to 60% and most preferably from 15% to 50%<br>
In accordance with the present invention, 80% or more of the acid source preferably has a particle size in the range of from about 150 microns to about 1200 or even 1000 or even 710 microns.<br>
Another essential feature of the present invention is a. carbonate source, including carbonate, bicarbonate and percarbonate salts, in particular bicarbonate and/or carbonate. Suitable<br>
carbonates to be used herein include carbonate and hydrogen carbonate .of potassium, lithium, sodium, and the like amongst which sodium and potassium carbonate are preferred, Suitable bicarbonates to be used herein include any alkali metal salt of bicarbonate like lithium, sodium, potassium and the like, amongst which sodium and potassium bicarbonate are preferred. Bicarbonate may be preferred to carbonate, because it is more-weigh effective, i.e.. at parity weigh bicarbonate is a larger CO2 "reservoir" than carbonate. However, the choice of carbonate or bicarbonate or mixtures thereof in the dry effervescent granules may be made depending on the pH desired in the aqueous medium wherein the dry effervescent granules are dissolved. For example where a relative high pH is desired in the aqueous medium (e.g,, above pH 9.5) it may be preferred to use carbonate alone or to use a combination of carbonate and bicarbonate wherein the level of carbonate is higher than the level of bicarbonate, typically "in a weight ratio of carbonate to bicarbonate from 0.1 to 10. more preferably from 1 to 5 and most preferably from 1 to 2.<br>
The carbonate source is preferably present in the dry effervescent granules according to the present invention at a level of from 0.1% to 99% by weight of the total, preferably from 30% to 95%, more preferably from 45% to 85% and most preferably from 50% to 80%.<br>
In accordance with the present invention^ 80% or more of the carbonate source preferably has a<br>
particle size in the range of from about 50 microns to about 1200 or even from 150 to 1000<br>
microns,	.<br>
For optimum effervescence in aqueous medium the weight ratio of acid to carbonate and/or bicarbonate in the dry effervescent granules is from 0.1 to 10, preferably from 0.5 to 2.5 and more preferably from 1 to 2.<br>
The diameter size of the dry effervescent granules of the present invention are preferably from 0,001 mm to 7 mm, preferably less than 2 mm,<br>
The diameter size as defined herein can be determined by sieving a sample of the granules into a. number of fractions (typically 5 fractions) on a series of sieves, with mazes of various diameter. or aperture size. The mean diameter size of the granules can be calculated by plotting the weight fractions, obtained by the sieving, against the aperture size of the sieves. The mean particle size is taken to be the aperture size through which 50% by weight of the sample would pass.<br>
The bulk density of the dry effervescent granules of the present invention is preferably from 500 g/1 to 1200 g/l, more preferably from 700 g/l to 1100 g/l.<br>
The dry effervescent granules of the present invention may optionally comprise a binder or a mixture thereof. Typically, the dry effervescent granules comprise up to 50 % by weight Of the total granule of a binder or a mixture thereof, preferably up to 35% and more preferably up to 20%. Suitable binders to use herein are those known to those skilled in the art and include anionic surfactants like C6-C20 alkyl or alkylaryl sulphonates or sulphates, preferably C8-C20 aklylbenzene sulphonates, cellulose derivatives such as carboxymethylcellulose and homo- or co- polymeric polycarboxylic acid or their salts, nonionic surfactants, preferably C10-C20 alcohol ethoxylates containing from 5-100 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol and more preferably the C15-C20 primary alcohol ethoxylates containing from 20-100 motes of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol. Of these tallow alcohol ethoxylated with 25 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol (TAE25) or 50 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol (TAE50) are preferred. Other preferred binders include the polymeric materials like polyvinylpyrrolidones with an average molecular weight of from 12 000 to 700 000 and polyethylene glycols with an average weight of from 600 to 10 000. Copolymers of maleic anhydride with ethylene, methylvinyl ether, methacrylic acid or acrylic acid are other examples of polymeric binders. Others binders further include C10-C20 mono and diglycerol ethers as well as C10-C20 fatty acids. In the embodiment of the present invention where a binder is desired C8-C20 alkylbenzene sulphonates are particularly preffered.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the granules according to the present invention consists of an acid, carbonate source and optionally a birider, wherein the acid, carbonate source and optionally the binder are in close physical proximity.<br>
The present invention further encompasses a process for manufacturing the dry effervescent granules of the present invention comprising an acid, carbonate source and optionally a binder, wherein the acid, carbonate source and optionally the binder are in close physical proximity. This process preferably comprises the steps of:<br>
-	first mixing the acid, carbonate source and optionally the binder to form a mixture,<br>
-	then submitting the mixture to a, preferably pressure, agglomeration step to form a agglomerate<br>
mixture,<br>
-	and finally granulation of the agglomerate mixture in a granulation step so as to obtain said<br>
granules.<br>
According to this process the effervescent raw materials and optionally the binder if present are first mixed together without the addition of water and/or moisture apart those coming from the raw materials themselves so as to obtain a dry free flowing powder mixture. Then this dry free flowing powder mixture comprising the effervescent particles (i.e. the acid and carbonate source), and optionally the binder particles if present, undergoes a pressure agglomeration step, i.e. a dry process step wherein this free flowing powder mixture undergoes high external forces that bring the particles closely together thereby densifying the bulk mass of said particles and creating binding mechanisms between the solid effervescent particles and the binder if present. Indeed, pressure agglomeration results in an aggregation mechanism which is characterised by the presence of inter particles bonds between primary solid effervescent particles and a structure in which these effervescent particles are still identifiable and retain many of their characteristics, e.g. the ability to react together in presence of water to deliver carbon dioxide.<br>
The increase of density associated to the preparation of the dry effervescent granules of the present invention obtainable by pressure agglomeration is closely linked to the pressure applied. Typically, the bulk density will increase up to 200g/l, preferably from 10 g/1 to 150 g/1, starting from the density of the mixture comprising the effervescent raw materials, i.e., acid and the carbonate source, and optionally the binder, before having undergone a pressure agglomeration.'<br>
Pressure agglomeration may be carried out using different processes which can be classified by the level of forces applied. A preferred process to be used herein 15 roller compaction. In this process the acid, bicarbonate and/or carbonate and optionally the binder after having been mixed together are forced between two compaction rolls that applies a pressure to said mixture so that the rotation of the rolls transforms the mixture into a compacted sheet/flake. This compacted sheet/flake is then granulated,<br>
Typical roller compactors for use herein is for example Phatmapaktor L200/50P® commercially available from Hosokawa Bepex GmbH. The process variables during the pressure agglomeration step via roller compaction are the distance between the rolls, the feed rate, the compaction pressure and the roll speed. Typical feeding device is a feed screw. The distance between the rolls is typically from 0.5 cm to 10 cm, preferably from 3 to 7 cm, more preferably from 4 to 6 cm. The pressing force is typically .between 20 kN and 120.kN, preferably from 30 kN to l00kN, more preferably from 40 KN to 80 kN. Typically, the roll speed is between 1 rpm and 180 rpm, preferably -from 2 rpm to 50 rpm and more preferably from 2 rpm to 35 rpm. Typically, the feed rate is between 1 rpm and 100 rpm, preferably from 5 rpm to 70 rpm, more<br>
preforably from 8 rpm to 50 rpm. Temperature at which compaction is carried out is not relevant. typically it varies from 0° C to 40 °C<br>
By "granulation step" it is meant that the resulting mixture after having undergone a pressure agglomeration step is cut into granules of the required length and rounded to obtain round or spherical granules according to the diameter size as defined herein before. In the preferred embodiment one way to carry out the granulation step after the roller compaction step is to mill the compacted Hake/sheet. Milling may typically be carried out with a Flake Crusher FC 200® commercially available from Hosokawa Bepex GmbH.<br>
Depending on the end diameter size desired for the dry effervescent granules the milled material may further be sieved. Such a sieving of the dry effervescent granules can for example be carried out with a commercially available Alpine Airjet Screen ®.<br>

As used herein, the expression "process of soaking fabrics" refers to the action of leaving fabrics to soak in a soaking liquor comprising water and a composition as described hereinabove, for a period of time sufficient to clean said fabrics, In contrast to typical laundering operation using a washing machine, the soaking process herein allows prolonged contact time between the fabrics and the soaking liquor, typically up to 24 hours. The soaking process can be performed independently from any other process, such as a typical laundering operation, or a first step before a second typical laundering step, or a second step after a first typical laundering operation. In the preferred soaking processes of the invention, fabrics are left to soak for a period of time ranging from 1 minute to 24 hours, preferably from 10 minutes to 24 hours, more preferably from 30 minutes to 18 hours, even more preferably 1 hour to 6 hours. After the fabrics have been immersed in said soaking liquor for a sufficient period of time, they can be removed .and rinsed with water. The fabrics can also be washed in a normal laundering operation after they have been soaked, with or without having been rinsed in-between the soaking operation and the subsequent laundering operation.<br>
In the soaking process herein, a soaking composition described hereinabove is diluted in an appropriate amount of water to produce a soaking liquor. Suitable doses may range from 40 to 55 grams of soaking composition in 3-5 to 5 liters of water, down to 90 to 100 grams of soaking composition in 20 to 45 liters of water. Typically one dose is 40-55 grams in 3.5 to 5 liters for a concentrated soak (bucket/sink). .For washing machine soaked, the dose is 90-100 grams in about 20 (Europe) to 45 (US) liters of water. The fabrics to be soaked are then immersed in the<br><br>
Once the washing machine has been loaded with, laundry the dispensing device containing the detergent product is placed inside the drum. At the commencement of the wash cycle of the washing machine water is introduced, into the drum and the drum periodically rotates. The design of the dispensing device should be such that it permits containment of the dry detergent product but then allows release of this product during the'wash cycle in response to its agitation as the drum rotates and also as a result of its contact with the wash water.<br>
To allow for release of the detergent composition during the wash the device may possess a number of openings through which the product may pass. Alternatively, the device may be made of a material which is permeable to liquid but impermeable to the solid product, which will allow release of dissolved product. Preferably, the detergent product will be rapidly released at the start of the wash cycle thereby providing transient localised high concentrations of product in the drum of the washing machine at this stage of the wash cycle.<br>
Preferred dispensing devices are reusable and are designed in such a way that container integrity is maintained in both the dry state and during the wash cycle. Especially preferred dispensing devices for use with the composition of the invention have been described in the following patents; GB-B-2, 157, 717, CB-B-2,, 157, 718, EP-A-0201376, EP-A-02S8345 and EP-A-0288346. An article by J,Bland published in Manufacturing Chemist, November 1989, pages 41-46 also describes especially preferred dispensing devices for use with granular laundry products which are of a type commonly know as the "granulette". Another preferred dispensing device for use with the compositions of this invention is disclosed in PCT Patent Application No. W094/11562. Especially preferred dispensing devices are disclosed in European Patent Application Publication Nos, 0343069 &amp; 0343070. The latter Application discloses a device comprising a flexible sheath in the form of a bag extending from a support ring defining an orifice, the orifice being adapted to admit to the bag sufficient product for one washing cycle in a washing process. A portion of the washing medium flows through the orifice into the bag, dissolves the product, and the solution then passes outwardly through the orifice into the washing medium. The support ting is provided with a masking arrangement to prevent egress of wetted, undissolved, product, this arrangement typically comprising radially extending walls extending from a central boss in a spoked wheel configuration, or a similar structure in Which the walls have a helical form. Alternatively, the dispensing device may be a flexible container, such as a bag or pouch. The bag may be of fibrous construction coated with a water impermeable protective, material so as to retain the contents, such as is disclosed in European published Patent Application No. 0018678. Alternatively it may be formed of a water-insoluble synthetic<br>
polymeric material provided with an edge seal or closure designed to rupture in aqueous media as disclosed in European published Patent Application Nos. 0011500, 0011501, OOU502, and 0011968- A convenient form of water frangible closure comprises a water soluble adhesive disposed along and sealing one edge of a pouch formed of a water impermeable polymeric film such as 'polyethylene or polypropylene,<br>
Packaging for<br>
Commercially marketed executions of the granular compositions can be packaged in any. suitable container including those constructed from paper, cardboard, plastic materials and any suitable laminates.<br>
form of the c, leading flotnpositions<br>
The granular compositions can be made via a variety of methods, including dry-mixing, extruding, compressing and agglomerating of the various components comprised in the detergent composition. The dry effervescence granule 6f the invention can be present in the cleaning compositions as a separate component of the composition, or can be part of or added to other components or compounds of the compositions,<br>
The cleaning compositions can take a variety of physical forms including granular, flakes, extrudates, tablet or bar forms. The cleaning compositions are particularly the so-called concentrated granular detergent compositions adapted to be added to a washing machine by means of a dispensing drawer or by means of a dispensing device placed in the machine drum with the soiled fabric load.<br>
The mean particle size of the base composition of granular cleaning compositions containing the foaming composition in accordance with the invention can be from 0.1 mm to 5,0 mm, but it should preferably be such that no more that 5% of particles are greater than 2.5mm in diameter, or even 1.7mm and that not more than 5% of particles arc- less than 0,1 5mm in diameter.<br>
The term mean particle size as defined herein is calculated by sieving a sample of the composition into a number of fractions (typically 5 fractions) on a series of Tyler sieves. The weight fractions thereby obtained are plotted against the aperture size of the sieves. The mean panicle size is taken to be the aperture size through which 50% by weight of the sample would pass.<br>
The bulk density of granular cleaning or detergent compositions containing the paniculate composition in accordance with the present invention typically have a bulk density of at least 300 g/litre, more preferably from 500 g/litre or even 650g/litre to 1200 g/litre, more preferably to 850 g/litre.<br>
P&amp;G<br>
The stain removal performance test method<br>
The stain removal performance of a given composition on a soiled fabric for example under soaking conditions, may be evaluated by the following test method. Soaking liquors are formed by diluting for instance 45 g of the soaking compositions herein in 3.78 liter of water 'or 90g of the soaking composition in 45 liters of water. Fabrics are then immersed in the resulting soaking liquor for a time ranging from 1 minute to, typically 18 hours. Finally, the fabrics are removed from the soaking liquors, rinsed with water and washed with a regular washing process, .handwash or washing machine wash, with a regular detergent, with or without re-using the soaking liquor, then said fabrics are left to dry.<br>
For example, typical soiled fabrics to be used in this stain removal performance test may be commercially available from EMC (Empirical Manufacturing Company) Cincinnati, Ohio, USA, such as clay, grass, spaghetti sauce, gravy, dirty motor oil, barbecue sauce, blood on. two different substrates: cotton (CW120) and polycotton (PCW28).<br>
The stain removal performance may be evaluated by comparing side by side the soiled fabrics treated with the composition according to the present invention with those treated with the reference, e.g., the same composition without such dry effervescent granules according to the present invention. A visual grading scale may be used to assign differences in panel score units .(psu), in a range from 0 to 4,<br>
The thermal stability test method/<br>
To evaluate thermal stability of a given composition, a sample thereof may-be placed in an oven whose temperature is setted at 60°C When the sample reaches the (ovcn temperature (6"0°C), it is isolated with an adiabatic bell and its temperature is monitored for 2 hours. The self heating rate is determined (SHR, average temperature increase ovct the first 2 hours). The lower the SHR the, more stable is the composition. •<br>
Thg_e£fervescenee.test method:<br>
Effervescence of a given granular composition may be measured via visual grading. A composition according to the present invention and a reference composition without the dry<br>
effervescent granules, or a reference composition wherein the effervescent materials, are uniformly and separately distributed in the whole granular composition, are each individually diluted into 5 liters of water at'35°C .and the resulting generation of carbon dioxide is evaluated by visual grading.<br>
The dissolution. test method:<br>
Dissolution characteristics of a given granular composition may be measured via visual grading. A composition according to the present' invention and a reference composition without the dry effervescent granules, or a reference composition wherein the effervescent materials are uniformly and separately distributed in the whole granular composition, are each individually diluted into 2 liters of water at 5°C. Then the water is evaporated with a standard evaporator with a black fabric instead of a paper filter. A visual grading scale 'may be used to assign differences in panel score units (psu), in a range from 0 to 4.<br>
 The dispenaing test method:<br>
Dispensing can be evaluated by means of a standard test using a washing machine by introducing a given weight of composition in the dispenser and flowing water over a given period of time-Then measuring the dry weight of laundry detergent composition,remaining in the dispenser, in grams, and.calculating the weight percentage of composition not dispensed into the machine.<br>
Bulk density test method;<br>
Bulk density of the granular composition and/or of the dry effervescent granules of the present invention may be measured by means of a simple funnel and cup device consisting of a conical funnel moulded rigidly on a base and provided with a flap valve at its lower extremity to allow the contents of the funnel to be emptied into an axially aligned cylindrical cup disposed below the funnel. The funnel is 130 mm high and has internal diameters of 130 mm and 40 mm at its respective upper and lower extremities. It is mounted so that the lower extremity is 140 mm above the upper surface of the base. The cup has an overall height of 90 mm, an internal height of 87 mm and an internal diameter of 84 mm. Its nominal volume is 500 ml. To carry but a measurement, the funnel is filled 'with powder by hand pouring, the flap valve is opened and powder allowed to overfill the cup. The filled cup is removed from the frame and excess powder removed from the cup by passing a straight edged implement e.g.; a knife, across its upper edge. The filled cup is then weighed and the value obtained for the weight of powder doubled to provide a bulk density in g/litre. Replicate measureihents are made as required.<br>

Soaking liquors are formed by diluting each time 45 g of the above compositions in between 3.5 lit, to 5.0 lit. af water. 0.5 to 2 Kg of fabrics are then each time immersed in said soaking liquor. The soaking periods for the soaking liquors comprising any of the soaking compositions 1 to 12 are typically from 1 minute to 24 hours,<br>
Finally, the fabrics are removed from the soaking liquors, rinsed with water and washed with a regular washing process, handwash or washing machine wash, with a regular detergent, with or without re-using the soaking liquor, then said fabrics are left to dry. Excellent stain removal performance is obtained with these compositions on various stains including greasy stains and/or enzymatic stains and/or bleachable stains and the like.<br>
