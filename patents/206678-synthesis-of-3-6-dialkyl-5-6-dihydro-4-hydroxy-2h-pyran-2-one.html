The present invention is directed to a process for producing 3,6-dialkyl-5,6-dihydro-4-hydroxy-pyran-2-one. In particular, the present invention is directed to an enantioselective process for producing the same.<br>
5-Lactones such as 3,6-dialkyl-5,6-dihydro-4-hydroxy-pyran-2-ones are useful intermediates in the preparation of a variety of fine chemicals and pharmaceutically active compounds. For example, 5,6-dihydro-3-hexyl-4-hydroxy-6-undecyl-pyran-2-one is a well known precursor for the preparation of oxetanones such as tetrahydrolipstatin (orlistat). See for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,245,056 and 5,399,720, both issued to Karpf et al.; and U.S. Patent Nos. 5,274,143 and 5,420,305, both issued to Ramig et al.<br>
Other methods of preparing tetrahydrolipstatin use aβ -hydroxy ester, e.g., methyl 3-hydroxy tetradecanoate, as an intermediate. See for example, Pommier et al., Synthesis, 1994, 1294-1300, Case-Green et al, SynletL, 1991,781-782, Schmid et al, Proceedings of the Chiral Europe '94 Symposium, September 19-20,1994, Nice, France, and the above mentioned U.S. Patents. Some methods of preparing oxetanones, such as those disclosed<br>
in the above mentioned U.S. Patents issued to Karpf et al., use a P-hydroxy ester as an intermediate to prepare the 5-lactone which is then used in the synthesis of oxetanones.<br>
The stereochemistry of a molecule is important in many of the properties of the molecule. For example, it is well known that physiological properties of drugs having one or more chiral centers, i.e., stereochemical centers, may depend on the stereochemistry of a drug's chiral center(s). Thus, it is advantageous to be able to control the stereochemistry of a chemical reaction.<br>
Many oxetanones, e.g., tetrahydrolipstatin, contain one or more chiral centers. Intermediates 5-lactone and p-hydroxy ester used in the synthesis of tetrahydrolipstatin contain one chiral center. Some syntheses of these intermediates, such as those disclosed in the above mentioned U.S. Patents issued to Karpf et al., are directed to the preparation of a racemic mixture which is then resolved at a later step to isolate the desired isomer. Other<br><br>
methods are directed to an asymmetric synthesis the β-hydroxy ester by enantioselectively reducing the corresponding β-ketoester.<br>
Moreover, in order to achieve a high yield of the desired product, some current asymmetric hydrogenation processes for reducing methyl 3-oxo-tetradecanoate require extremely pure reaction conditions, e.g., hydrogen gas purity of at least 99.99%, thus<br>
further increasing the cost of producing the correspondingβ-hydroxy ester.<br>
Therefore, there is a need for a process for producing 8-lactones. And there is a<br>
need for enantioselectively reducing P-ketoesters under conditions which do not require extremely pure reaction conditions or high hydrogen gas pressure.<br>
In more detail, the present invention is directed to a process for the preparation of a 5-lactone of the formula (I):<br><br><br><br>
followed by treating said 5-hydroxy-protected-p-enol ether ester with an acid to produce said 5-lactone, wherein in the above formulae R1 is C1-C20 alkyl; R is H or C1-C10 alkyl; R is a hydroxy protecting group; R4 and R5 in formulae (III) and (IV) are independently C1-C6 alkyl, C5-C30 aryl,<br>
C6-C20 arylalkyl or -SiR8R9R10, wherein R8, R9, R10is independentlyC1-C6<br>
alkyl or phenyl; R5 in formulae (V) and (VI) is C1-C6 alkyl, C5-C20 aryl, or C6-C2o arylalkyl; R5 is C1-C6 alkyl, C5-C20 aryl or C6-C20 arylalkyl; R6 is H or R4; R7 is H or R3, and X is a halide.<br>
As used herein, the term "treating", "contacting" or "reacting" refers to adding or mixing two or more reagents under appropriate conditions to produce the indicated and/or the desired product. It should be appreciated that the reaction which produces the indicated and/or the desired product may not necessarily result directly from the combination of two reagents which were initially added, i.e., there maybe one or more intermediates which are produced in the mixture which ultimately leads to the formation of the indicated and/or the desired product.<br>
The term "alkyl" refers to aliphatic hydrocarbons which can be straight or branched chain groups. Alkyl groups optionally can be substituted with one or more substituents, such as a halogen, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl, hydroxy, amino, thio, alkoxy, carboxy, oxo or cycloalkyl. There may be optionally inserted along the alkyl group one or more oxygen, sulfur or substituted or unsubstituted nitrogen atoms. Exemplary alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, /-propyl, n-butyl, t-butyl, fluoromethyl, difluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl, chloromethyl, trichloromethyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, decyl and undecyl.<br>
The term "aryl" refers to monocyclic or bicyclic carbocyclic or heterocyclic aromatic ring moieties. Aryl groups can be substituted with one or more substituents, such as a halogen, alkenyl, alkyl, alkynyl, hydroxy, amino, thio, alkoxy or cycloalkyl. Exemplary aryl<br><br>
groups include phenyl, toluyl, pyrrolyl, thiophenyl, furanyl, imidazolyl, pyrazolyl, 1,2,4-triazolyl, pyridinyl, pyrazinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyridazinyl, thiazolyl, isothiazolyl, oxazolyl, and isoxazolyl.<br>

In one embodiment of the process of the present invention, the process includes treating an acyl halide of the formula:<br>
with a ketene acetal of the formula: <br>
111 under conditions sufficient to produce a 8-hydroxy-protected-P-enol ether ester of the formula:<br><br><br>

A variety of protecting groups, including protecting groups for hydroxy and carboxylic acid functional groups, are known in the art, and can be employed. Examples of many of the possible protecting groups can be found in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd edition, T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1999, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
With reference to compounds described above (Formulae I, VII, IC, ID, Ila, III, IVa): Preferably, R is undecyl. Preferably, R is C1-C10 alkyl, more preferably hexyl. Preferably, R3 is a moiety of the formula -SiRllR12R13, where each of Ru, R12 and R13 is independently Ci-C6 alkyl or phenyl, more preferably each of Ru, R12 and R13 is independently methyl, isopropyl, tert-butyl or phenyl. More preferably R3 is a moiety of the formula -Si(CH3)3. Preferably, R4 is a moiety of the formula -SiR8R9R10. Preferably each of R8, R9 and R10 is independently methyl, isopropyl, tert-butyl or phenyl. More preferably R4 is a moiety of the formula -Si(CH3)3. Preferably, R5 is C1-C6 alkyl, C5-C20 aryl or C6-C2o arylalkyl. More preferably R5 is CrC6 alkyl. Still more preferably R5 is methyl or ethyl. Preferably, R6 of compound IVa is same as R4 of compound IV, particularly when R4 is a moiety of the formula -SiR R R  .<br>
Processes of the present invention also include treating 8-hydroxy-protected-P-enol ether ester IVa under reaction conditions sufficient to remove at least one of the protecting groups (i.e., R and/or R , preferably at least R ) and contacting the resulting deprotected compound with an acid to produce the 5-lactone VII.<br>
A particularly useful ketene acetal III is a silyl ketene acetal in which R4 is a moiety of the formula -SiR8R9R10 and R5 is C1-C6alkyl, C5-C20 aryl or C6-C20 arylalkyl. Silyl ketenes can be readily prepared by any of the currently known methods. Some of the methods for preparing silyl ketenes are disclosed in Miura et al., Bull Chem. Soc. Jpn., 1991, 64, 1542-1553; Umemoto and Gotoh, Bull. Chem. Soc Jpn.y 1987, 60, 3823-3825; Sugimoto et al., Chem. Lett., 1991,1319-1322; Miura et al, Bull Chem. Soc. Jpn., 1992, 65, 1513-1521; and Shono et al., /. Org. Chem.y 1984,49, 1056-1059, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br><br>
The silyl ketene acetal III can be prepared from the corresponding ester (i.e., a compound of the formula R -CH2-C(=0)OR ) by treating the ester with a strong base such as lithium hexamethyl disilazide (LiHMDS), a dialkylamide, e.g., lithium diisopropylamide and lithium tetramethylpiperidine (LiTMP), in a conventional aprotic organic solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), hexane, dimethoxy ethane (DME), ether or mixtures thereof, to generate an enolate and trapping (i.e., contacting) the enolate with a silylating agent, including a silyl triflate and silyl halide, such as silyl chloride, e.g., trimethylsilyl chloride. Dialkylamide can be prepared by treating the corresponding dialkylamine with a strong base, such as an alkyl lithium (e.g., butyl lithium) in a conventional aprotic organic solvent described above. The preparation of silyl ketene acetal III is generally carried out under preferably an inert atmosphere such as nitrogen, argon, helium or the like, at a# temperature preferably at or less than about 0 °C, more preferably at or less than about -30 °C, and most preferably at about -78 °C. The silyl ketene acetal III can be purified, e.g., by distillation under a reduced pressure. When R' is C1-C10alkyl and IT and RD are different moieties, the resulting silyl ketene acetal III can have two different geometric isomers, i.e., E- or Z-double bond configuration. It should be appreciated that since the carbon atom of 5-lactone VII containing R2 group is not a chiral-center (or the chirality is not significant because it can be readily isomerized), the geometric isomer of the silyl ketene acetal is not important for enantioselective processes of the present invention.<br>
In one particular embodiment of the present invention, the 5-hydroxy-protected-P-enol ether ester V, where R is R4, is prepared by reacting the above described silyl ketene acetal III with the acyl halide III, where R3 is a moiety of the formula -SiRuRl2R13. The reaction is typically carried out in a conventional aprotic organic solvent, such as THF, toluene, heptane, hexane or mixtures thereof, in the presence of a tertiary amine including trialkyl amine, such as triethyl amine or tributyl amine, under preferably an inert atmosphere described above. Preferably, the reaction temperature is in the range of from about 0 °C to about 25 °C<br>
The crude 5-hydroxy-protected-p-enol ether ester IVa can be purified, e.g., by distillation under a reduced pressure or by chromatography, or it can be used directly in the next step without any purification. As used herein, a "crude" compound refers to a compound which is not subject to a separate purification step other then a conventional work-up of the reaction.<br>
The resulting 8-hydroxy-protected-p-enol ether ester V, in particular where R and R6 are a moiety of the formula -SiRuR12R13 and -SiR8R9R10, respectively, can be selectively i    monodesilylated to produce a 8-siloxy-P-ketoester of the formula:<br><br><br>
under acidic or basic conditions, preferably under basic conditions. For basic<br>
monodesilylation conditions, typically a tertiary amine including a trialkylamine, such as<br>
triethylamine or preferably tributylamine; or a bicarbonate, such as potassium bicarbonate,<br>
lithium bicarbonate or preferably sodium bicarbonate, is used. The monodesilylation<br>
reaction can be conducted in a protic solvent, such as alkyl alcohol (e.g., methanol, ethanol<br>
and isopropanol), or a mixture of aprotic organic solvent and a protic solvent (e.g., alkyl<br>
alcohol or water). Exemplary aprotic organic solvents which are useful in	*<br>
monodesilylation reaction include methylene chloride, dimethyl formamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), THF and ether. Preferably, the monodesilylation reaction is carried out in an alkyl alcohol solvent, more preferably in methanol. The monodesilylation reaction temperature range is preferably from about 0 °C to about 25 °C.<br>
The 8-siloxy-P-ketoester Via can be further desilylated under acidic or basic conditions, preferably under acidic conditions, and cyclized to produce the 5-lactone VII. Desilylation of a hydroxy group is well known to one of ordinary skill in the art and is disclosed in the above mentioned Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, For acidic desilylation conditions, typically an acid such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, acetic acid, or trifluoroacetic acid is used. Desilylation of the 5-siloxy-P-ketoester Via under an acidic condition results in a rapid cyclization to produce the 5-lactone VII, thus eliminating a need for a separate cyclization step.<br>
Altenatively, the 8-lactone VII can be produced by removing both of the protecting groups (R3 and R6) from the 5-hydroxy-protected-p-enol ether ester IVa in a single step and contacting the deprotected product with an acid under conditions sufficient to produce the 5-lactone VII. As used herein, the term "single step" refers to removal of both protecting groups R3 and R6 under same reaction conditions. In a particular embodiment of the present invention, where R and R1 of 5-hydroxy-protected-p-enol ether ester IVa are moieties of the formula -SiRnR12R13 and -SiR8R9R10, respectively, it is preferred that both of the silyl groups are removed in a single step under a basic condition, typically using a hydroxide or preferably a carbonate. Exemplary hydroxides which can be used in the present invention include sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide. Exemplary carbonates which are useful in the present invention include potassium carbonate, lithium carbonate, sodium carbonate and cesium carbonate. Preferred carbonate is potassium carbonate. A single step removal of both silyl groups can be carried out in a same solvent as those described above for<br><br>
monodesilylation. The reaction temperature range of a single step desilylation and subsequent production of the 5-lactone VII is preferably from about 0 °C to about 25 °C.<br>
Typically, the 5-lactone VII is produced by adjusting the pH of the reaction mixture to from about pH 3 to about pH 5. Any acid which is capable of providing the above described pH range of the reaction mixture may be used, such acids include, but are not limited to, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and phosphoric acid. In one particular embodiment of the present invention, hydrochloric acid is used to produce the 5-lactone. The 5-lactone VII thus formed typically precipitates from the reaction mixture, e.g., when methanol is used as the solvent. The 5-lactone VII can be further purified, e.g., by recrystallization, to obtain higher purity and/or higher enantiomeric excess of 5-lactone VII.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the acyl halide Ha is treated with a malonate half acid of the formula:<br>
U <br>
Via where R1, R2 and R5 are described above, and R7 is H or R". Preferably, R7 is H.<br>
The process of the present invention also includes contacting the S-hydroxy-(3-ketoester Via with a base or preferably an acid under conditions sufficient to produce the 5-lactone VII, as described above.<br>
The reaction between the acyl halide Ha and the malonate half acid V is typically carried out in the presence of a metal coordinating agent and a tertiary amine base. See for example, Rathke and Cowan, /. Org. Chem., 1985,50,2622-2624, and Clay et al., Synthesis, 1993, 290-292, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. The reaction can be conducted under an aprotic organic solvent, such as n-butyl ether, THF, acetonitrile, methylene chloride, dimethoxyethane (DME), methyl t-butyl ether (MTBE), toluene, 2-methyl tetrahydrofuran (2-Me-THF), with THF being the preferred solvent. Without being bound by any theory, it is believed that the use of a metal coordinating agent generates a metal enolate of the malonate half acid VII, which is sufficiently reactive to react with the acyl halide III, but is not basic enough to deprotonate the initially formed product, which contains an acidic proton.<br><br>
In general, the reaction between the acyl halide Ila and the malonate half acid V is conducted by adding the acyl halide III, preferably in a solution, to a solution mixture which includes the malonate half acid VII, the metal coordinating agent and the tertiary amine base. Higher yield of the 8-hydroxy-P-ketoester Via can be obtained by using at least about 2 equiv. of a relatively non-nucleophilic base, such as a tertiary amine, and at least 1 equiv. of the metal coordinating agent relative to the amount of malonate half acid VII.<br>
Exemplary metal coordinating agents include magnesium salts including magnesium halides, such as MgCl2, MgBr2 and Mgl2; manganese salts, such as manganese halides and manganese acetates; lithium salts, such as lithium halides; samarium salts, such as samarium halides; and mixtures of sodium and lithium salts, such as mixtures of sodium halides and lithium halides. Preferably, the metal coordinating agent is a magnesium salt, more preferably magnesium chloride.<br>
Exemplary tertiary amine bases which are useful in the present invention include trialkylamines, such as triethylamine, diethylisopropylamine and tributylamine; and other tertiary amines. Preferably, the tertiary amine base is a trialkylamine, more preferably triethylamine, diethylisopropylamine or tributylamine.<br>
Typically, the reaction between the acyl halide Ila and the malonate half acid V is conducted at a temperature ranging from about 0 °C to about 35 °C, under preferably an inert atmosphere as those described above. Preferably, the reaction is conducted at about 25 °C.<br>
The resulting 8-hydroxy-p-ketoester Via can be isolated or preferably used directly without isolation and treated with an acid under conditions sufficient to produce the 8-lactone VII. For example, after reacting the acyl halide Ila with the malonate half acid VII, an acid described above is added to the resulting reaction mixture, which results in the formation of the 8-lactone VII.<br>
Preferably, alkyl malonate half acid V is methyl malonate half acid VII, where R5 is methyl, as the methyl 8-hydroxy-p-ketoester Via produces the 8-lactone VII in higher yield than other malonate half acid V under similar reaction conditions and time. One can take advantage of this higher yield by methyl malonate half acid V by converting a non-methyl malonate half acid V to methyl malonate half acid VII, and then reacting the methyl malonate half acid V with the acyl halide Ila to produce the 8-lactone VII. For example, ethyl malonate half acid VII, where R5 is ethyl, can be reacted with a metal methoxide, such as sodium methoxide, in methanol under conditions sufficient to produce the methyl malonate half acid V from ethyl malonate half acid VII, and then reacting the resulting<br><br>
methyl malonate half acid V with acyl halide Ha to produce the 8-lactone VII. Alternatively, the product of a reaction between non-methyl malonate half acid V and the acyl halide Ila can be converted to its corresponding methyl 8-hydroxy-P-ketoester Via prior to contacting with an acid or preferably in situ during the cyclization step to produce the5-lactoneVII.<br>
The malonate half acid VII, where R is not H, can be prepared by a variety of methods. For example, malonate half acid V can be prepared by treating malonate diester, e.g., R5OC(=0)CH2C(=0)OR5, with a base, such as sodium ethoxide, to generate the corresponding enolate and contacting the enolate with an alkyl group containing a leaving group, for example, mesylate, tosylate and halides such as bromide and iodide, to produce an alkyl malonate diester, i.e., R5OC(=0)CH(R2)C(=0)OR5. The alkyl malonate diester is then monosaponified, typically using less than about 1 equiv., preferably about 0.9 equiv. of hydroxide in the corresponding R5 alcohol solvent to produce the malonate half acid VII, for example, by treating with a hydroxide, such as potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide or lithium hydroxide, in methanol (when R5 is methyl) or ethanol (when R5 is ethyl).<br>
Processes of the present invention can also include the step of producing the acyl halide Ila from a p-hydroxy acid or salts thereof, such as potassium or sodium salts, of the formula: <br>
by protecting the hydroxy group to produce a P-hydroxy-protected ester of the formula:<br><br>
and contacting the p-hydroxy-protected ester Xa with an acyl halogenating agent under conditions sufficient to produce the acyl halide III, where R1 and R" are described above and R14 is H, R3 or a carboxylate counter cation. As used herein, the term "carboxylate counter cation1' refers to a counter ion of the carboxylic salt of formula Xa. Exemplary carboxylate counter cations include metal cations, such as sodium, lithium and potassium; ammonium; mono-, di-, tri- and tetra-alkyl ammonium; pyridinium; and other suitable cations for carboxylic anions which are known to one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
In one particular embodiment of the present invention, the acyl halide Ila is produced by contacting the p-hydroxy acid IXa with a silylating agent to produce a p-silyloxy silyl ester of the formula:<br><br>
and contacting the P-silyloxy silyl ester XIa with an acyl halogenating agent, where R  , R and R13 are those described above. Any hydroxy silylating agent known in the art can be used to produce the p-silyloxy silyl ester XI. Exemplary silylating agents include compounds of the formula X'-SiR11^13, where R11, R12 and R13 are described above and X1 is a halide or triflate; and hexamethyldisilazane (when Ru, R12 and R13 are methyl).<br>
11	11<br>
For example, P-trimethylsiloxy trimethyl silyl ester of compound XI, where R , R<br>
and R13 are methyl, can be prepared by treating the p-hydroxy acid with	t<br>
chlorotrimethylsilane (TMSC1) in the presence of pyridine preferably under an inert atmosphere described above. The reaction is preferable conducted in an aprotic organic solvent such as methylene chloride, MTBE, toluene and THF, with THF being a particularly preferred solvent. The temperature range of the reaction is generally from about 0 °C to about 25 °C, preferably the reaction temperature is about 25 °C. The reaction can also include 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) or other silylating catalyst known to one of ordinary skill in the art. When a silylating catalyst such as DMAP is present, it is typically used at about 1 mole %. Even without the presence of a silylating catalyst, silylation is typically complete within few hours, generally within about 2 hours at room temperature.<br>
Alternatively, the P-trimethylsiloxy trimethyl silyl ester XIa can be prepared by using hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS). For example, heating a mixture of P-hydroxy acid IXa and HMDS in an aprotic organic solvent, such as toluene or preferably THF, produces the P-trimethylsiloxy trimethyl silyl ester XI. When HMDS is used, one of the by-products of the reaction is ammonia, which can be readily removed by partially distilling the reaction solvent typically at atmospheric pressure. The resulting partially concentrated solution of P-trimethylsiloxy trimethyl silyl ester XIa can be used directly in the acyl halide Ha producing step without further purification.<br>
A variety of acyl halogenating agents are known to one of ordinary skill in the art. Exemplary acyl halogenating agents and general procedures for using the same are disclosed, for example, in "Comprehensive Organic Synthesis," vol. 6, Trost, Fleming and Winterfeldt eds., Pergamon Press, 1991, pp. 301-319, and "The Chemistry of Acyl Halides," Patai, ed., Interscience Publishers, 1972, pp. 35-64, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. It has been found by the present inventors that P-hydroxy-protected ester X, in particular P-trimethylsiloxy trimethyl silyl ester XI, can be readily<br><br>
converted to the acyl halide Ila using oxalyl chloride or thionyl chloride in an aprotic organic solvent, such as toluene or preferably THF.<br>
When using oxalyl chloride as the acyl halogenating agent, pyridine and a catalytic amount of silylating catalyst such as DMF is typically used. However, when thionyl chloride is used as the acyl halogenating agent in place of oxalyl chloride, a need for using a silylating catalyst such as DMF is eliminated. In either case, formation of pyridinium salts in acyl halogenation reaction may complicate the reaction between the ketene acetal III and the acyl halide III. To avoid possible complications in the reaction between the ketene acetal III and the acyl halide III, typically pyridinium salts are removed from the reaction mixture, e.g., by filtration. The resulting reaction mixture is then further concentrated, e.g., by distillation, which also removes at least a portion of any residual TMSC1, thionyl chloride and THF. The distillation is generally conducted under a reduced pressure at about 0 °C.<br>
It has been found by the present inventors that when HMDS is used as the silylating agent for P-hydroxy acid IXa in THF, the subsequent acyl halogenation reaction with thionyl chloride in THF is slow at 0 °C and gives poor yields at higher reaction temperatures. However, a presence of pyridinium salts, such as pyridinium hydrochloride, pyridine or DMAP increases the reaction rate and yields higher amounts of the desired acyl halide III. Thus, when HMDS is used as the silylating agent, pyridine is typically added to the subsequent acyl halogenation reaction. The amount of pyridine added is generally from about 1 mole% to about 10 mole%, and preferably about 2 mole%. The halogenation reaction is conducted at a reaction temperature of typically about 0 °C.<br>
Processes of the present invention can also include enantioselective preparation of P-hydroxy acid IXa from a p-ketoester of the formula:<br><br>
by enantioselectively reducing the ketone carbonyl of the P-ketoester XII and saponifying the ester group to produce the p-hydroxy acid IXa, where R1 is described above and R18 is Q-Cfi alkyl, C5-C20 aryl or C6-C20 arylalkyl. Preferably R18 is Q-Ce alkyl, more preferably methyl or ethyl.<br>
In one particular embodiment of the present invention, an enantioselective preparation of P-hydroxy ester IXa involves hydrogenation of the P-ketoester XII in the presence of a chiral hydrogenation catalyst. It should be appreciated that a non-chiral hydrogenation catalyst will result in racemic mixture of p-hydroxy ester IXa , and a chiral hydrogenation catalyst having an opposite configuration as those described below will<br><br>
result in p-hydroxy ester having an opposite configuration as that shown in Figure IXa . Specifically, the present invention provides a process for enantioselectively reducing the p-ketoester XII using an enantiomerically enriched hydrogenation catalyst, i.e., hydrogenation catalyst having greater than about 97 % enantiomeric excess (%ee).<br>
In one particular embodiment of the present invention, the chiral hydrogenation catalyst comprises a ruthenium catalyst containing a chiral ligand such as those shown in the Examples section, including a catalyst of the formula:<br><br>
where X is a halide, such as iodide, bromide or preferably chloride, and each of R   and R is independently H, Q-Ce alkyl or Q-C6 alkoxy, provided at least one of R19 or R20 is not H. Moreover, each phenyl group may contain more than one R19 or R20 groups. Furthermore, one or both of the phenyl groups of the bisphenyl moiety may be replaced with other aromatic groups such as a naphthyl, pyridyl or other substituted aryl groups.<br>
One of the useful hydrogenation catalyst of the present invention is a product produced by contacting a ruthenium diacetate of the formula Ru(OAc)2((i?)-MeOBIPHEP) with a halide source, such as alkaline metal halides (e.g., LiX, NaX, KX and CsX, where X is a halide) or hydrohalides (e.g., HX, where X is a halide), preferably hydrochloric acid, where Ru(OAc)2((i?)-MeOBIPHEP) is a compound of the formula:<br><br>
Without being bound by any theory, it is believed that treating Ru(OAc)2((R)-MeOBIPHEP) with hydrochloric acid results in replacing both of the OAc groups with chloride; thus, the resulting product is believed to be Ru(Cl)2((£)-MeOBIPHEP). Interestingly, however, when Ru(OAc)2((R)-MeOBIPHEP) is treated with less than about 2 equiv. of HC1, the resulting hydrogenation catalyst does not produce (R)-3-hydroxy ester<br><br>
IXa in a high enantiomeric excess. Surprisingly and unexpectedly, in some cases such a hydrogenation catalyst produces (S)-3-hydroxy ester predominantly. However, when at least about 5 equiv. of HC1 is added to Ru(OAc)2((£)-MeOBIPHEP), preferably at least about 10 equiv. and more preferably at least about 20 equiv., the resulting hydrogenation catalyst enantioselectively reduces the P-ketoester XII to the corresponding (3i?)-3-hydroxy ester.<br>
The precursor of chiral hydrogenation catalyst of the present invention, i.e., ruthenium dicarboxylate diphosphine compound or [Ru(OC(=0)R')2(diphosphine)], can be prepared according the following reaction scheme:<br>
NaOAc/AcOH	,<br>
[RuCl2(COD)]n + Diphosphine 	+-      Ru(OC(=0)R')2(diphosphine)<br>
Toluene<br>
In this manner a variety of chiral ruthenium dicarboxylate diphosphine, including those listed in Example 16, can be prepared. The process for preparing a ruthenium dicarboxylate diphosphine compound generally involves contacting [RuCl2(COD)]n, which is commercially available or preferably prepared according to the procedure of Albers et al., Inorg. Synth.y 1989,26&gt; 68, with a mixture of a carboxylate salt and the corresponding carboxylic acid, i.e., MOC(=0)R' and HOC(=0)R' mixture, such as sodium acetate/acetic acid and sodium pivalate/pivalic acid mixtures, in an aprotic organic solvent, preferably toluene. The mixture is heated at a temperature of about 80 °C to about 120 °C, preferably about 100 °C. A typical reaction time is from about 15 hours to about 72 hours, preferably from about 20 hours to about 48 hours. The amount of carboxylate salt used can be about 2 equiv. to about 50 equiv., preferably about 2 equiv. to about 25 equiv., more preferably about 2.1 equiv. to about 10 equiv., and most preferably about 2.5 equiv. Preferably a small excess of [RuCl2(COD)]n is used relative to the diphosphine compound to ensure complete conversion of the diphosphine compound.<br>
While commercially available [RuCl2(COD)]n complex can be used, it has been found that freshly prepared [RuCl2(COD)]n complex from ruthenium trichloride generally affords shorter reaction time, more consistant and/or higher yield of ruthenium dicarboxylate diphosphine compound. In this manner, a one-pot synthesis of ruthenium dicarboxylate diphosphine compound can be achieved from inexpensive and readily available ruthenium trichloride.<br>
The P-hydroxy compound (e.g., (3i?)-3-hydroxy compound) IXa can be further purified, i.e., enantiomerically enriched, by recrystallizing the initial product to afford a product having at least about 99 %ee. Therefore, it should be appreciated that depending on the cost of a particular chiral hydrogenation catalyst, it maybe more economical to use<br><br>
a chiral hydrogenation catalyst which provides less than about 95 %ee of the p -hydroxy compound IXa, which can be further enantiomerically enriched by recrystallization.<br>
Unlike currently used ruthenium-based hydrogenation catalysts for asymmetric reduction of methyl 3-oxotetradecano-ate, the hydrogenation catalyst of the present invention does not require high purity conditions, e.g., hydrogen gas having purity of at least about 99.99%, to produce methyl 3-hydroxytetradecanoate in high yield and high enantiomeric excess. In fact, the asymmetric hydrogenation of methyl 3-oxotetradecanoate under technical grade conditions, e.g., hydrogen gas having purity of about 99.5% and nitrogen gas having purity of about 99.5%, using the hydrogenation catalyst of the present invention proceeds with a substantially similar rate as those     / requiring high purity reaction conditions. Moreover, the hydrogenation catalyst of the present invention allows the use of lower hydrogen gas pressure, thereby reducing the cost of initial capital investments and reducing the danger associated with high hydrogen gas reaction conditions. In addition, by using asymmetric hydrogenation processes described above, the present invention allows asymmetric synthesis of the 5-lactone VII without a need for resolving any racemic intermediates.<br>
Typically, hydrogenation of P-ketoester XII, e.g., methyl 3-oxotetradecanoate, is conducted in a conventional hydrogenation solvent including an alkyl alcohol, such as ethanol or preferably in methanol, at a reaction temperature of about 80 °C. The concentration of the substrate (i.e., P-ketoester XII) in hydrogenation reaction is generally at about 40 wt%, and the ratio of HC1 to Ru(OAc)2((i?)-MeOBIPHEP) in the hydrogenation catalyst is about 20:1. A typical ratio of methyl 3-oxotetradecanoate to the hydrogenation catalyst is about 50,000:1. To this reaction mixture, typically about 40 bar of technical grade hydrogen gas is added, and the reaction is allowed to proceed for about 4 hours (h). The resulting methyl (£)-3-hydroxy tetradecanoate is then saponified by diluting the crude hydrogenation solution in methanol and 28% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution at room temperature. The saponified product is then acidified with an acid, such as sulfuric acid, to isolate (i?)-3-hydroxy tetradecanoic acid. In this manner, the P-hydroxy acid III, such as(£)-3-hydroxy tetradecanoic acid, can be produced in at least about 90% isolated yield from the corresponding P-ketoester XII, more preferably in at least about 93% isolated yield and most preferably in at least about 95% isolated yield. The enantiomeric excess of the product is at least about 90%ee, preferably at least about 95%ee, and more preferably at least about 99%ee. The enantiomeric excess can be increased to at least about 95%ee after a single recrystallization, preferably at least about 99%ee, and most preferably at least about 99.5%ee.<br><br>
The P-ketoester XII can be readily prepared by a variety of known methods. See for example, Case-Green, Synlett&gt; 1991, 781-782 and U.S. Patent No. 5,945,559, issued to Sotoguchi et al., which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.<br>
The 8-lactone VII can also be prepared by treating a 2-alkyl-acetoacetate ester of the formula:<br><br>
XIII with acyl halide Ila and contacting the resulting product with a base or preferably an acid, such as ones described above, under conditions sufficient to produce the 8-lactone VII, wherein R and R are those described above.<br>
Without being bound by any theory, it is believed that a reaction between the 2-alkyl-acetoacetate ester XIII and the acyl halide Ila produces a-acetyl-p-ketoester of the formula: <br>
as the initial product, where R , R and R~ are those described above and R is Ci-Qo alkyl. Solvolysis, e.g., methanolysis (i.e., contacting with methanol), in basic or preferably acidic conditions, of a-acetyl-P-ketoester XIV removes the acyl group to produce the 8-hydroxy-P-ketoester VIII, where R is R", which can then be used to produce the 8-lactone VII as described above. Preparation of P-ketoesters from methyl acetoacetate is disclosed in Japanese Patent No. 10-53561, issued to Sotokuchi et al., which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.<br>
The 2-alkyl-acetoacetate ester XIII can be prepared by forming an enolate of acetoacetate ester by contacting the acetoacetate ester with a base, such as calcium oxide or calcium hydroxide, in typically refluxing toluene followed by reacting the enolate with the acyl halide III.<br>
Alternatively, the 8-hydroxy-P-ketoester Via (where R is Ci-Qo alkyl, preferably hexyl), and hence ultimately the 8-lactone VII, can be produced by reacting acetoacetate ester (compound XIII, where R2 is H) with acyl chloride Ila as described above to initially produce the 8-hydroxy-p-ketoester Via (where R is H). The 8-hydroxy-P-ketoester VIII, where R2 is H, can be deprotonated with a base to produce a second enolate which can be reacted with an alkyl group containing a leaving group, such as those described above, e.g.,<br><br>
hexyl bromide, to produce the S-hydroxy-p-ketoester Via (where R is Q-Qo alkyl, e.g., hexyl). In generating the second enolate, a reverse addition, i.e., addition of the 8-hydroxy-P-ketoester Via (where R is H) to a solution containing a base, can be used, for example, to reduce the amount of elimination product which may result in the conventional addition step, i.e., addition of a base to a solution of the 8-hydroxy-p-ketoester VIII.<br>
Additional objects, advantages, and novel features of this invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon examination of the following examples thereof, which are not intended to be limiting.<br><br>

Diethyl malonate (425 mL, 2.80 mol) in 50 mL of ethanol was added dropwise via a   * 500-mL pressure-equalized dropping funnel over 45 min at room temperature with stirring (150 rpm). Additional ethanol (250 mL) was added during the addition to redissolve precipitated salts. The funnel was washed with 150 mL of ethanol.

Into a 2 liter 2-necked round bottomed flask equipped with a thermometer, a Claisen head, a reflux condenser topped with an argon inlet and a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar was purged 3 times with vacuum and argon gas, was charged ruthenium (III) chloride hydrate (Ru content at 43.48 %&gt; Johnson Matthey &amp; Brandenberger AG, 42.0 g, 0.179 mol). The flask is then vacuum purged with argon 3 times. Ethanol (420 mL) and ci$,cis-1,5-cyclooctadiene (44 mL, 358 mmol) were added and the dark suspension was stirred at reflux for 24 h at a external heating bath temperature of 100 °C. After this period, the resulting brown suspension was cooled to room temperature and allowed to settle for 30 min, and the slightly yellow supernatant was removed with suction with a micro-filter candle (P4-porosity).<br>
The brown residue was stirred with ethanol (500 mL) for 10 min and allowed to settle for 30 min. The slightly yellow supernatant was removed with suction as above. In order to remove most residual ethanol and cyclooctadiene, the solid residue consisting of [RuCl2(COD)]n was taken up in toluene (500 mL) and rotary evaporated to dryness (55 °C at 50 mbar). The apparatus was then charged under argon with (-R)-(6,6&gt;-dimethoxybiphenyl-2,2,-diyl)bis(diphenylphosphine) ((£)-MeOBIPHEP) (99.4 g, 171<br><br>
mmol) and sodium acetate (70 g, 853 mmol) and purged with argon as above. After the addition of toluene/acetic acid (1:1 v/v, 1.0 L), the brown reaction mixture was stirred at a 100 °C bath for 22 h. After removal of volatiles by rotoevaporator (58 °C at 30 mbar) the residue was dried in vacuo (1 mbar) for 1 h at 50 °C and overnight at room temperature.<br>
The resulting brown residue was taken up in toluene (500 mL), the suspension was stirred for 15 min at room temperature and filtered with argon protection on a high porosity glass sintered filter covered with a 2 cm pad of pressed filter aid. The filter cake was rinsed five times with 100 mL toluene (total of 500 mL), the filtrates collected and rotary evaporated to dryness (60 °C at 30 mbar). After having been dried under vacuum (1 mbar) overnight at room temperature, the brown residue was treated under stirring with methanol (500 mL). The thick suspension was stirred for 1 h at 50 °C, for 1 h at room temperature and finally for 1 h in an ice/methanol bath. After removing the solvent with a micro-filter candle (P4-porosity), the residue was stirred with methanol (3 X 120 mL) in the ice/methanol bath, and the solvent was removed as described above. The yellow residue was dried in vacuo (1 mbar) overnight at room temperature and then dissolved at 50 °C under stirring in toluene (150 mL).<br>
Pentane (600 mL) was added dropwise to the resulting brown solution under stirring over 2 h at a temperature of 40-50 °C resulted in the formation of a yellow-brown suspension, which was stirred for 45 min at room temperature and for 1.5 h in an ice bath (ca. 2 °C). After removal of the supernatant by suction with a micro-filter candle (P4-porosity), the residue was stirred in pentane (500 mL) for 30 min at room temperature. Removal of the supernatant as above and drying in vacuo (1 mbar) overnight at room temperature afforded 117.0 g of the desired product as an adduct with 0.7 toluene, as a yellow powder (86 % yield, 93 % purity).<br>
