				<td>A Security Element For Security Papers And Method Of<br>
Production Thereof<br>
This invention relates to a security element for security papers, bank notes, ID<br>
cards or the like, and to a security paper and document of value having such a security<br>
element. Further, the invention relates to methods for producing the security element<br>
and the security paper and document of value having such a security element.<br>
EP 0 330 733 A1 proposes a security thread that is testable both visually and by<br>
machine. For this purpose a transparent plastic foil is coated metallically and this<br>
coating provided with gaps in the form of characters or patterns. Furthermore, the<br>
security thread contains in the areas congruent with the gaps chromophoric and/or<br>
luminescent substances that cause the characters or patterns to differ in color contrast<br>
from the opaque metal coating under suitable light conditions. The metal layer used is<br>
preferably an aluminum layer. This security thread is embedded in security papers as a<br>
so-called "window security thread," i.e. it is quasi woven into the paper during sheet<br>
formation of the security paper so that it is freely accessible on the surface of the paper<br>
at regular intervals and completely embedded in the paper only in the intermediate<br>
areas.<br>
This security thread already meets a very high security standard. The continuous<br>
metallic coating permits machine testing of electric conductivity, while the gaps serve<br>
as a visual authenticity feature readily recognizable to the viewer in transmitted light.<br>
In addition, the thread has an additional feature not readily recognizable to the viewer,<br>
namely the luminescence in the area of the gaps, which is likewise testable by<br>
machine. When bank notes having such a security thread are viewed fleetingly,<br>
however, the metallic luster of the window areas is primarily striking. This luster can<br>
be imitated by simply gluing aluminum foil elements. Upon a fleeting check solely in<br>
reflected light, such forgeries could therefore be taken for authentic bank notes.<br>
The invention is therefore based on the problem of proposing a security element<br>
as well as a security paper and document of value that have elevated forgery-proofness<br>
in comparison to the prior art.<br><br>
This problem is solved by the features of the independent claims. Developments<br>
are the subject matter of the subclaims.<br>
According to the invention, the security element has at least two metal layers of<br>
different color that are disposed on the same surface of the security element and are<br>
preferably directly adjacent at least in certain areas. The optical impression of such a<br>
security element can be imitated, if at all, only with very high effort, in particular if the<br>
different-colored metal layers are applied in complicated patterns, which are possibly<br>
also intertwined. For example, a multicolor metallic picture motif composed of<br>
different-colored metals can be produced. The metal layers are preferably disposed in<br>
this connection on a plastic layer that is part of the security element.<br>
The metal layers need not be disposed in one plane of the security element but<br>
can be disposed one above the other at least in certain areas. The visible color effect<br>
can then be varied via the layer thickness of the metal layers. If at least the layer<br>
thickness of the upper layer is selected so thin that it is translucent, the viewer ~<br>
perceives the mixed color of the two metal layers.<br>
The two metal layers can also be disposed one above the other over a large<br>
surface, whereby gaps where the lower metal layer is visible are incorporated in the<br>
upper metal layer in certain areas by additional measures. If the lower metal layer also<br>
has interruptions that are preferably offset from the gaps in the upper layer, and the<br>
security element is disposed so that it is observable on both sides, two different-<br>
colored metal layers can be perceived from each side.<br>
Analogously, three and more metal layers can also be disposed one above the<br>
other and exposed in certain areas by special measures. The metal layers do not<br>
necessarily all have to be disposed on the same surface of the security element in this<br>
connection. The metal layers do not all need to have a different inherent color either.<br>
The color effect can also be determined by printing a transparent ink.<br>
The metals may be for example aluminum, chrome, nickel, copper, gold, silver or<br>
other nonferrous metals or colored metal alloys. Metallic-looking compounds, such as<br>
gold-colored titanium nitride, can also be used.<br><br>
A further possibility for increasing forgery-proofness is to use metals with<br>
different physical properties, in particular different magnetic or electric properties. For<br>
example, iron and aluminum differ both in their color and in their magnetic properties.<br>
This difference can be detected by measurement technology and therefore serves as a<br>
machine-detectable authenticity feature.<br>
Forgery-proofness can be increased additionally if the metal layers have gaps in<br>
the form of alphanumeric characters, patterns, logos or the like.<br>
The security element can be a security thread that consists of a self-supporting<br>
plastic foil to which the different-colored metal layers are applied. This security thread<br>
can be incorporated at least partly in a security paper or security document. However,<br>
it is also possible to form the security element in the form of a band or label and fasten<br>
it to the surface of the security paper or document of value.<br>
The plastic foil of the security element can moreover be provided with diffraction<br>
structures in the form of a relief structure. The diffraction structures can be any<br>
diffractive structures such as holograms or grid structures (e.g. kinegrams®,<br>
pixelgrams) or the like.<br>
Alternatively, the security element can also be executed as a transfer element.<br>
This variant is especially advantageous if the security element is disposed completely<br>
on the surface of the security paper or document of value. In this case the layer<br>
structure of the security element is prepared on a carrier foil, usually a plastic foil, and<br>
then transferred to the security paper or document of value in the desired contours by a<br>
hot embossing method.<br>
With this security element too, a diffraction structure can of course be integrated<br>
into the layer structure of the security element. In addition, the security element can<br>
have further security features, such as a thin-film structure, printed image or the like.<br>
If the security element is disposed on the surface of the security paper or<br>
document of value, it can have any outline structures, for example round, oval, star-<br>
shaped, rectangular, trapezoidal or strip-shaped contours.<br><br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the security paper or document of value to<br>
which the security element is applied has a through opening. The security element is<br>
disposed in this connection in the area of the opening and protrudes beyond it on all<br>
sides. In this case the security element is checkable from the front and back. The<br>
different metals are likewise recognizable from both sides, absolutely "congruently."<br>
Imitation of the color effect is therefore especially difficult or fully ruled out in this<br>
embodiment.<br>
The use of the inventive security element is not limited to the field of security<br>
documents, however. The inventive security element can also be used advantageously<br>
in the field of product protection for protecting any goods from forgery. For this<br>
purpose, the security element can have additional antitheft elements, for example a coil<br>
or chip. This applies analogously to the security paper or document of value provided<br>
with such a security element.<br>
The metal layers are preferably applied with a vapor deposition unit, the<br>
individual metallic areas each being produced by masks. If more than two metal layers<br>
are used, individual metal layers can be produced by printing metallic inks or metal-<br>
pigmen-ted inks.<br>
The gaps are preferably produced in the particular metal layers by a washing<br>
method as described in WO 99/13157, which is incorporated herein by reference. The<br>
security elements are prepared in this connection as a security foil having a plurality of<br>
copies of the security element. The basic material forms a self-supporting, preferably<br>
transparent plastic foil. This plastic foil corresponds in the case of security threads or<br>
labels to the inventive plastic layer of the security element. When the security elements<br>
are detached from an embossed foil, the plastic foil forms the carrier material of this<br>
transfer material to which the plastic layer is applied for example in the form of a<br>
lacquer layer. Diffraction structures can be embossed into this lacquer layer or, in the<br>
case of security threads or labels, into the plastic foil. The inventive plastic layer of the<br>
security element is printed in the form of the later gaps preferably by intaglio printing.<br>
For this purpose an ink with a high pigment content is used that forms a pored, raised<br>
inking. The different-colored metal layers are then vapor-deposited on the printed<br><br>
plastic layer, optionally using masks. In a last step, the inking and the metal layer<br>
thereabove are finally removed by washing out with a fluid, possibly combined with<br>
mechanical action. A water-soluble ink is preferably used so that water can be used as<br>
the fluid. This method thus is non-polluting and does not require any special<br>
precautions. This method further has the advantage that the gaps are produced for both<br>
or a plurality of metal layers in one operation. Washing out can be supported by<br>
mechanical means such as a rotating cylinder, brush or ultrasound.<br>
The use of etching techniques is much more elaborate but in principle likewise<br>
possible. Here the metal layers are first deposited on the plastic layer and the total<br>
surface then printed with a protective lacquer layer except for the areas to be removed.<br>
The total security element layer structure is then passed through an etching bath where<br>
the uncovered areas are detached from the plastic layer. If different etching baths are<br>
necessary for the different metals, the process of covering and immersing in an etching<br>
bath must be repeated with different etching solutions. Neutralization and cleaning<br>
baths are to be provided between the individual etching baths so that the chemicals of<br>
the individual baths are not contaminated.<br>
A further possibility is to produce the gaps in the metal layers galvanically by<br>
electrolysis. Here the metal layers are likewise first deposited on the plastic layer and a<br>
passivation layer then printed in the remaining metallic areas. The security element<br>
layer structure is finally passed through an electrolytic bath using the metal layer as a<br>
cathode. The electrolytic solution and voltage to be used is to be coordinated with the<br>
metals used. Here, too, it might be necessary to use different electrolytic solutions for<br>
the different metals. The principle of this method is known to the expert and explained<br>
in more detail e.g. in WO 00/02733, which is likewise incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
Other methods are likewise possible, such as removing the metal layer areas<br>
mechanically, or producing the interruptions by means of laser scriber, electron-beam<br>
erosion or other removal methods.<br><br>
Luminescent substances, liquid-crystalline substances, metallic printing inks or<br>
metal bronzes can be disposed in the metal-layer-free intermediate areas and serve as a<br>
further authenticity feature.<br>
Further embodiments and advantages of the inventive security element, security<br>
paper and document of value will be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. The<br>

Fig. 1 shows an inventive document of value in a top view. The shown example<br>
involves bank note 1. Said bank note has strip-shaped security element 2 extending<br>
over the total width of bank note 1. The total surface of security element 2 facing the<br>
viewer is metallic, areas 3, 4 bearing different-colored metals, which are directly<br>
adjacent and disposed alternatingly in the shown example.<br>
The security element shown in Fig. 1 is a diffractive security element consisting<br>
of an embossed plastic layer and at least one metallic reflective layer.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a cross section along line A - A in Fig. 1. Here one can see plastic<br>
layer 5 in which diffraction structure 6 is incorporated. Different-colored metal layers<br>
3, 4 are disposed alternatingly directly adjacent therebelow. The layers of the security<br>
element are fastened to the document of value via adhesive layer 30 in the shown<br>
example.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a further embodiment of an inventive security element in a top<br>
view. Here, additional gaps 7, 8 are disposed in different metallic areas 3, 4. These<br>
gaps may show any signs, alphanumeric characters, patterns, logos or the like. Further,<br>
only metallic areas 3, 4 are directly adjacent. Between metallic areas 4 and 9 there is<br>
large nonmetallic space 12. Likewise metallic area 9 can bear a metal having a third<br>
inherent color different from the inherent colors of the metals in areas 3,4.<br>
The security element shown in Fig. 3 can be for example security thread 10, as<br>
shown in cross section in Fig. 4. Security thread 10 consists of preferably transparent<br>
carrier foil 11 on which different-colored metal layers 3, 4, 9 are disposed.<br>
The same appearance as in Fig. 3 can also be shown by a transfer material used<br>
for producing security elements on security papers, documents of value or the like.<br>
Transfer material 13 consists of carrier foil 14 to which plastic layer 15 is applied.<br>
Diffraction structures 6 are incorporated in the form of a relief structure in plastic layer<br>
15. Different-colored metal layers 3,4, 9 are disposed thereabove. Finally, transfer<br><br>
material 13 also has optional adhesive layer 16 that is activated by heat and pressure in<br>
the areas to be transferred upon transfer to the corresponding security paper or<br>
document of value for fastening corresponding metal layers 3, 4, 9 and plastic layer 15<br>
to the security paper or document of value. In a last step, carrier foil 14 is removed.<br>
In gaps 7, 8 and space 12 adhesive layer 16 is directly adjacent to diffraction<br>
structure 6. If adhesive layer 16 and plastic layer 15 have a very similar refractive<br>
index, diffraction structure 6 is no longer to be recognized in these areas.<br>
If required by the specific application of the security element, removal of the<br>
carrier foil can be dispensed with. The carrier foil can in this connection be equipped<br>
with good adhesive properties by additional measures.<br>
If the security thread shown in Fig. 4 is likewise to have a diffraction structure,<br>
the latter can be incorporated in carrier foil 11 or a separate plastic layer disposed<br>
between carrier foil 11 and metal layers 3,4.<br>
Fig. 6 shows schematically the method for producing an inventive security<br>
element whose metal layers are provided with gaps in certain areas. The method will<br>
be explained by way of example for security threads or labels, but can of course be<br>
used analogously for security elements with other layer sequences. The security<br>
elements are preferably produced as a security foil having a plurality of copies of the<br>
security element. The starting point in the example shown here is self-supporting<br>
plastic foil 17. It is printed in a first step with highly pigmented ink 18 in the areas<br>
where the gaps are later to be present so that a large-pored print arises, as shown in<br>
Fig. 6a). Different-colored metal layers 3, 4 are then applied over total printed plastic<br>
foil 17 in the desired form. For this purpose a vapor deposition method is preferably<br>
used by which individual metals 3, 4 are vapor-deposited on plastic foil 17<br>
successively using masks. In the area of print 18 no contiguous metal layer is formed<br>
due to the porous surface structure of the ink. The intermediate product provided with<br>
metal layers 3, 4 is shown in Fig. 6b).<br>
Since no solid metal surface forms in the area of print 18, print 18 and metal<br>
layers 3, 4 present in this area can be removed virtually without effort by washing out.<br><br>
Water is preferably used for washing out. It might be necessary to additionally use<br>
brushes that ensure complete removal of print 18. The final product is shown in Fig.<br>
6c). Metal layers 3, 4 have gaps 7, 8. The security foil can finally be cut into security<br>
elements of the desired form.<br>
The washing method offers the advantage of obtaining sharp and defined edge<br>
contours, so that this method can also produce very fine high-resolution characters or<br>
patterns in the metal layers.<br>
In the described examples the surface areas of different metals are preferably<br>
disposed side by side. Despite this the metal layers can also be disposed one above the<br>
other or in partial overlap. It is only important that side-by-side metal areas of different<br>
color or structure are recognizable upon visual viewing. This is important because it<br>
can be helpful during application of the metal layers if the first metal layer can be<br>
disposed over the whole area, the second on partial areas of the first, the third over the<br>
whole or part of the area on one or both preceding layers, etc. This reduces register<br>
problems and simplifies the use of marks.<br>
Fig. 7 shows a corresponding embodiment of the document of value shown in<br>
Fig. 1 in cross section along line A - A. In this case security document 1 is provided in<br>
the area of security element 2 with all-over metal layer 4 and metal layer 3 provided<br>
only in certain areas so that metal layer 4 is recognizable in areas 7. Gaps 7 can<br>
likewise be produced by the "washing method" described above with reference to Fig.<br>
6. This method is recommendable in particular when different-colored metal layers 3,<br>
4 are prepared on a separate carrier and then transferred to the document of value or<br>
document substrate. Any other methods for producing the gaps can of course likewise<br>
be used. Special mention should also be made in this context of the removal method by<br>
means of a laser beam. Here, metal layers 3, 4 are first applied to the document of<br>
value or a carrier all over. Metal layer 3 is then subjected in the area of gaps 4 to a<br>
laser beam that removes metal layer 3 in these areas without damaging metal layer 4.<br>
Figs. 8 and 9 show further embodiments of the inventive security element<br>
provided with three different-colored metal layers. This variant is suitable in particular<br>
for application as a security thread, but is not limited thereto.<br><br>
In security thread 10 shown in Fig. 8, carrier foil 11 is provided all over with<br>
metal layer 9 having a first color. Metal layers 3 and 4, whose inherent color differs<br>
from metal layer 9, are applied thereabove. Metal layers 3 and 4 are provided only in<br>
certain areas and can have congruent gaps 19 in which metal layer 9 is visible.<br>
Additionally, metal layer 3 can have gaps 7 where metal layer 4 is visible.<br>
Fig. 9 shows an embodiment wherein metal layer 9 is disposed on the opposite<br>
surface of carrier foil 11. In the example shown here, metal layer 9 also has gaps 20. In<br>
the example shown here, metal layer 9 can also consist of the same material as one of<br>
metal layers 3,4. If metal layer 9 is also to have a special inherent color at least in<br>
certain areas, it can be printed with transparent color lacquer layer 21.<br>
Fig. 10 shows a further embodiment of an inventive security element in a top<br>
view. The security element has in this case two different-colored metal layers 3,4 and<br>
further printed image 22 that are disposed in register. Such a security element is<br>
preferably produced by the above-described washing method.<br>
For this purpose a layer structure as shown in Fig. 1 la is prepared on carrier<br>
material 25. In a first step, metal layer 4 is applied to carrier material 25 all over. In a<br>
next method step, printed image 22 is printed. Washing ink 18 is applied preferably in<br>
overlap and in any case in register with color layer 22. Metal layer 3 is finally vapor-<br>
deposited on this layer structure all over in a further vapor-depositing step. During the<br>
washing operation washing ink 18 is removed, thereby exposing the areas of printed<br>
image 22 covered by said ink, and metal layer 4. Fig. lib shows this layer structure in<br>
cross section.<br>
To avoid register problems it might also be expedient to dispose printed image 22<br>
in the fringe area over washing ink 18, as shown in Fig. 12. During the washing<br>
operation the washing ink is dissolved and removed partly mechanically, thereby also<br>
removing the ink thereabove. This makes it possible to produce interpenetrating<br>
surfaces of different metallic color which can additionally be disposed in register with<br>
other colored printed images. Alternatively, however, printed image 22 can also be<br>
disposed under the washing ink.<br><br>
Fig. 13 shows such a security element after the washing operation in a top view.<br>
Here, three circular areas are disposed concentrically. Printed image 22 is disposed in<br>
the innermost area. Printed image 22 is surrounded by a circular area of metal layer 3<br>
having a first inherent color. This is in turn enclosed by a likewise circular area with,<br>
metal layer 4. The total area surrounding metal layer 4 is in turn formed by metal layer<br>
3.<br>
Printed image 22 can consist only of a color layer or else be a complicated<br>
multicolor printed image in the examples shown. This printed image can also be<br>
formed using any inks, such as UV-curable inks, metallic inks or inks with<br>
luminescent or optically variable pigments added.<br>
Likewise, the contour forms of the metal layers or printed images shown are not<br>
limited to the simple geometrical forms shown. Any complicated motifs are possible.<br>
The different metal layers can also be separated by demetalized or unmetalized areas.<br>
Likewise, the embodiments shown can be combined with any further security<br>
features, for example diffraction structures or liquid-crystalline layers.<br>
Finally, the layer sequences shown can also be transferred to any embodiments of<br>
the security element used. Thus, the layer sequences shown with reference to security<br>
threads can be transferred analogously to transfer materials or label materials and vice-<br>
versa.<br><br>
