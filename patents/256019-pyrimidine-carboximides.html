Background of Invention<br>
Signals necessary for cell growth, differentiation, response to bioregulatory molecules, infectious agents and physiological stress involve changes in the rates of gene expression. The ability to respond appropriately to such signaling events challenges the survival of the cell and ultimately the organism. Pertrubations in the normal regulation of these specific genetic responses can result in pathogenic events that lead to acute and chronic diseases. In certain autoimmune diseases or chronic inflammatory states, continuous activation of T-cells eventually leads to a self-perpetuating destruction of normal tissues or organs. This caused by the induction of adhesion molecules, chemotaxis of leukocytes, activation of leukocytes and the production of mediators of inflammation, all of these events are regulated at the level of transcription for the production of new proteins, including cytokines. The production of cytokines, as well as a number of other cellular regulators, is controlled by a family of proteins, known as transcription factors (TFs). These transcription factors, when activated, bind to specific regions on the DNA and act as molecular switches or messengers to induce or upregulate gene expression. The activation of these TFs is caused by a variety of external signals including physiological stress, infectious agents and other bioregulatory molecules. Once the plasma membrane receptors are activated, a cascade of protein kinases and second messengers are induced which, in turn, result in the production of RNA transcripts. The end result is<br><br>
the production of RNA transcripts, and proinflammatory proteins via translation and processing of the RNA transcripts.<br>
The activation system can, at times, be very robust. For example, a specific set of external signals could result in a single transcription factor to induce many proteins responsible for a given disease. Therefore, regulating this process by disrupting the production of activated TF(s) has the potential to attenuate the production of the associated pathological proteins, thereby halting or reversing the course of the disease.<br>
Two transcription factors, NFkB and AP-1, have been show to regulate the production of many proinflammatory cytokines and related proteins that are elevated in immunoinflammatory diseases. These TFs regulate interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-2 (IL-2), tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) levels in a variety of cell types. For example, NFkB and other related complexes are involved in the rapid induction of genes whose products function in the protective and proliferative responses upon exposure of cells to external stimuli. Similarly, AP-1 has a significant role in the regulation of IL-2 and TNF-a transcription during T-cell activation. In addition, TNF-a and IL-1 are strong activators of collagenase, gelatinase and stromelysin gene expression, which require a single AP-1 binding site in the promoter region of these genes. Therefore, an inhibitor of NFkB and/or AP-1 activation would coordinately repress the activities of a series of proteinases. In addition, cell adhesion molecules are also controlled by these TFs. All of these proteins have shown to play a role in diseases, including osteoarthritis, transplant rejection, ischemia, reperfusion injury, trauma, certain cancers, viral disorders, and autoimmune diseases such a rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, glomerulonephritis, lupus and juvenile diabetes, In summary, the role of these TFs is to act as a transducer for certain stimuli that lead to immune, inflammatory, and acute phase responses.<br><br>
Since many diseases are caused by the inappropriate production of proteins, conventional therapeutic approaches have focused on inhibiting function or activity of individual effector proteins. These treatments have not always proved to be effective and, at times, are associated with many undesirable side effects. Therefore, there is a need for new therapies for the prevention and/or treatment of immunoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases. More specifically, there is a need for compounds that prevent, preferably by inhibiting transcription at an early stage, the production of proteins associated with immunoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Furthermore, these compounds should inhibit the kinase(s) that regulate the activation of TFs such as NFkB and AP-1. The present invention fulfulls these needs and provides further related advantages.<br>
The present invention is concerned with the treatment of immunological diseases or inflammation, notably such diseases are mediated by cytokines or cyclooxygenases. The principal elements of the immune system are macrophages or antigen-presenting cells, T cells and B cells. The role of other immune cells such as NK cells, basophils, mast cells and dendritic cells are known, but their role in primary immunologic disorders is uncertain. Macrophages are important mediators of both inflammation and provide the necessary "help" for T cell stimulation and proliferation. Most importantly macrophages make IL-1, IL-12 and TNF-ot all of which are potent pro-inflammatory molecules and also provide help for T cells. In addition, activation of macrophages results in the induction of enzymes, such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and cyclooxygenase-3 (COX-3), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and production of free radicals capable of damaging normal cells. Many factors activate macrophages, including bacterial products, superantigens and interferon gamma (IFNy). It is believed that phosphotyrosine kinases (PTKs) and other undefined cellular kinases are involved in the activation process.<br><br>
Cytokines are molecules secreted by the immune cells and large numbers of chronic and acute conditions have been recognized to be associated with perturbation of the inflammatory response. A large number of cytokines participate in this response, including IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF. It appears that the activity of these cytokines in the regulation of inflammation rely at least in part on the activation of an enzyme on the cell signalling pathway, a member of the MAP known as CSBP and RK. This kinase is activated by dual phosphorylation after stimulation by physiochemical stress, treatment with lipopolysaccharides or with proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF. Therefore, inhibitors of the kinase activity of p38 are useful anti-inflammatory agents.<br>
Cytokines are molecules secreted by the immune cells that are important in mediating immune responses. Cytokine production may lead to the secretion of other cytokines, altered cellular function, cell division or differentiation. Inflammation is the body's normal response to injury or infection. However, in inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, pathologic inflammatory processes can lead to morbidity and mortality. The cytokine, TNF-a, plays a central role in the inflammatory response and has been targeted as a point of intervention in inflammatory diseases. TNF-a is a polypeptide hormone released by activated macrophages and other cells. At low concentrations, TNF-a participates in the protective inflammatory response by activating leukocytes and promoting their migration to the extravascular sites of inflammation (Moser et al., J Clin Invest, 83, 444-55,1989). At higher concentrations, TNF-a can act as a potent pyrogen and induce the production of other pro-inflammatory cytokines (Haworth et al., Eur J Immunol, 21, 2575-79, 1991; Brennan et al, Lancet, 2, 244-7, 1989). TNF-a also stimulates the synthesis of acute-phase proteins. In rheumatoid arthritis, a chronic and progressive inflammatory disease affecting about 1% of the adult U.S. population, TNF-a mediates the cytokine cascade that leads to joint damage and<br><br>
destruction (Arend et aly Arthritis Rheum, 38, 151-60, 1995). Inhibitors of TNF-a, including soluble TNF receptors (etanercept) (Goldenberg, Clin Ther, 21, 75-87, 1999) and anti-TNF-a antibody (infliximab) (Luong et al.9 Ann Pharmacother, 34, 743-60, 2000), have been recently approved by the U.S.FDA as agents for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.<br>
Elevated levels of TNF-ct have also been implicated in many other disorders and disease conditions, including cachexia, septic shock syndrome, osteoarthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis etc.<br>
Elevated levels of TNF-a and/or IL-1 over basal levels have been implicated in mediating or exacerbating a number of disease states including rheumatoid arthritis; osteoporosis; multiple myeloma; uveititis; acute and chronic myelogenous leukemia; pancreatic Î² cell destruction; osteoarthritis; rheumatoid spondylitis; gouty arthritis; inflammatory bowel disease; adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); psoriasis; Crohn's disease; allergic rhinitis; ulcerative colitis; anaphylaxis; contact dermatitis; asthma; muscle degeneration; cachexia; type I and type II diabetes; bone resorption diseases; ischemia reperfusion injury; atherosclerosis; brain trauma; multiple sclerosis; cerebral malaria; sepsis; septic shock; toxic shock syndrome; fever, and myalgias due to infection. HIV-1, HIV-2, HIV-3, cytomegalovirus (CMV), influenza, adenovirus, the herpes viruses (including HSV-1, HSV-2), and herpes<br>
zoster are also exacerbated by TNF-a.<br>
It can be seen that inhibitors of TNF-a are potentially useful in the treatment of a wide variety of diseases. Compounds that inhibit TNF-a have been described in several patents. Excessive production of IL-6 is implicated in several disease states, and it is highly desirable to develop compounds that inhibit IL-6 secretion. Compounds that inhibit IL-6 have been described in U.S Patents: 6004813, 5527546 and 5166137.<br><br>
The cytokine IL-1Î² also particÎ²ates in the inflammatory response. It stimulates thymocyte proliferation, fibroblast growth factor activity, and the release of prostaglandins from synovial cells. Elevated or unregulated levels of the cytokine IL-lp have been associated with a number of inflammatory diseases and other disease states, including but not limited to adult respiratory distress syndrome, allergy, Alzheimer's disease etc. Since overproduction of IL-lp is associated with numerous disease conditions, it is desirable to develop compounds that inhibit the production or activity of IL-Î².<br>
In rheumatoid arthritis models in animals, multÎ²le intra-articular injections of IL-1 have led to an acute and destructive form of arthritis (Chandrasekhar et al., Clinical Immunol Immunopathol. 55, 382, 1990). In studies using cultured rheumatoid synovial cells, IL-1 is a more potent inducer of stromelysin than TNF-a. (Firestein, Am. J. Pathol. 140, 1309, 1992). At sites of local injection, neutrophil, lymphocyte, and monocyte emigration have been observed. The emigration is attributed to the induction of chemokines (e.g., IL-8), and the up-regulation of adhesion molecules (Dinarello, Eur. Cytokine Netw. 5, 517-531, 1994).<br>
In rheumatoid arthritis, both IL-1 and TNF-a induce synoviocytes and chondrocytes to produce collagenase and neutral proteases, which leads to tissue destruction within the arthritic joints. In a model of arthritis (collagen-induced arthritis i.e.CIA in rats and mice) intra-articular administration of TNF-a either prior to or after the induction of CIA led to an accelerated onset of arthritis and a more severe course of the disease (Brahn et al., Lymphokine Cytokine Res. 11, 253, 1992; and Cooper, Clin. Exp.Immunol. 898, 244, 1992).<br>
IL-8 has been implicated in exacerbating and/or causing many disease states in which massive neutrophil infiltration into the sites of inflammation or injury (e.g., ischemia) is mediated; chemotactic nature of IL-8, including, but is not limited to, the following: asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, adult respiratory distress<br><br>
syndrome, cardiac and renal reperfusion injury, thrombosis and glomerulonephritis. In addition to the chemotaxis effect on neutrophils, IL-8 also has the ability to activate neutrophils. Thus, reduction in IL-8 levels may lead to diminish, neutrophil infiltration.<br>
It has been reported that Cyclooxygenase enzyme exists in three isoforms, namely, COX-1, COX-2 and COX-3. COX-1 enzyme is essential and primarily responsible for the regulation of gastric fluids, whereas COX-2 enzyme is present at the basal levels and is reported to have a major role in the prostaglandin synthesis for inflammatory response. These prostaglandins are known to cause inflammation in the body. Hence, if the synthesis of these prostaglandins is stopped by way of inhibiting COX-2 enzyme, inflammation and its related disorders can be treated. COX-3 possesses glycosylation-dependent cyclooxygenase activity. Comparison of canine COX-3 activity with murine COX-1 and COX-2 demonstrated, that this enzyme is selectively inhibited by analgesic/antÎ²yretic drugs such as acetaminophen, phenacetin, antÎ²yrine, dÎ²yrone, and is potently inhibited by some nonsteroidal antiÂ¬inflammatory drugs. Thus, inhibition of COX-3 could represent a primary central mechanism by which these drugs decrease pain and possibly fever. Earlier reports prior to Coxib's development show that inhibitors of COX-1 enzyme cause gastric ulcers, whereas selective COX-2 and COX-3 enzyme inhibitors are devoid of this function and hence are found to be safe. But, recent reports show that the selective COX-2 inhibitors (Coxib's) are associated with cardiovascular risks. So, inhibition of COX-2 without causing cardiovascular risks and gastric ulcers due to inhibition of COX-1 is shown to be safe and is concerned in the present invention.<br>
Cardiovascular pathologies that remain the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in western society include several diseases, such as ishemic cardiopathy of which myocardial infarction represents the most important form. Ischemic cardiopathy is characterized by an inadequacy between supply and demand in<br><br>
oxygenated blood correlated with a diminution of coronary blood flow due to coronary artery stenosis or occlusion. This artery occlusion often caused by atherosclerous lesions, acute thrombosis, edema, ballooning of atheromatous plaque, or bleeding (Pearson et al., Am J.Pathol, 86, 657-664, 1977; HoR1e etal, Br Heart J. 40: 153 - 161, 1978; Koenig, Cardiol.Review, 9:31-35, 2001). TXA2 is a potent platelet activator and constR1ctor of vascular and bronchial smooth muscles. TXA2 is a short live lÎ²idic mediator generated by the cyclooxygenase pathway, is mainly produced by platelets, macrophages, and lung parenchyma. TXA2 is a potent platelet activator and constR1ctor of vascular and bronchial smooth muscles. It has been demonstrated that drugs able to antagonize TXA2 receptors or to inhibit thromboxane synthase (TS) reduce the seveR1ty of myocardial ischemia (Schror etal, Am J.Physiol, 238: 87 -92, 1980; Burke etal, Br J Clin Pharmacol, 15:97S- 101S, 1983; Hock etal, Eur. J. Pharmacol, 122:213-219, 1986; Brezinsky etal, J.Cardio-vasc Pharmacol, 9:65-71, 1987) and is also concerned in the present invention.

DescR1bed below are the examples of pharmacological assays used for finding out the efficacy of the compounds of the present invention wherein their protocols and results are provided.<br>
In vitro evaluation of Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibition activity<br>
The compounds of this invention exhibited in vitro inhibition of COX-2. The COX-2 inhibition activities of the compounds illustrated in the examples were determined by the following method. Human Whole Blood Assay<br>
Human whole blood provides a protein and cell R1ch milieu appropR1ate for the study of biochemical efficacy of anti-inflammatory compounds such as selective COX-2 inhibitors. Studies have shown that normal human blood does not contain COX-2 enzyme. This is correlating with the observation that COX-2 inhibitors have<br><br>
no effect on prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production in normal blood. These inhibitors were active only after incubation of human blood with lÎ²opolysacchaR1de (LPS), which induces COX-2 production in the blood.<br>
Fresh blood was collected in tubes containing sodium hepaR1n by vein puncture from healthy male volunteers. The subjects should have no apparent inflammatory conditions and should have not taken NSAIDs for at least 7 days pR1or to blood collection. Blood was pre-incubated with aspiR1n in vitro (12jig/ml, at time zero) to inactivate COX-1 for 6 hours. Then test compounds (at vaR1ous concentrations) or vehicle were added to blood. After that blood was stimulated with LPS B: 4 (10 fig/ml) and incubated for another 18 hours at 37Â°C water bath. After which the blood was centR1fuged, plasma was separated and stored at -80Â°C (J. Pharmacol. Exp.Ther, 271, 1705, 1994; Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA., 96, 7563, 1999). The plasma was assayed for PGE2 using Cayman ELISA kit as per the procedure outlined by the manufacturer (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, USA). Representative results of COX-2 inhibition are shown in the Table I. Table I:<br><br>
COX-1 and COX-2 enzyme based assay<br>
COX-1 and COX-2 enzyme based assays were carR1ed out to check the inhibitory potential of test compounds on the production of prostaglandin by puR1fied recombinant COX-l/COX-2 enzyme (Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA, 88, 2692-2696,<br><br>
1991; J. Clin. Immunoassay 15, 116-120, 1992) In this assay, the potential of the test compound to inhibit the production of prostaglandin either by COX-1 or COX-2 from arachidonic acid (substrate) was measured. This was an enzyme based in-vitro assay to evaluate selective COX inhibition with good reproducibility.<br>
Arachidonic acid was converted to PGH2 (Intermediate product) by COX1/COX-2 in presence or absence of the test compound. The reaction was carR1ed out at 37Â°C and after 2 minutes it was stopped by adding 1M HC1. Intermediate products PGH2 was converted to a stable Prostanoid product PGF2a by SnCl2 reduction. The amount of PGF2a produced in the reaction was inversely proportional to the COX inhibitory potential of the test compound. The prostanoid product was quantified via enzyme immunoassay (EIA) using a broadly specific antibody that binds to all the major forms of Prostaglandin, using Cayman ELISA kit as per the procedure outlined by the manufacturer Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, USA). Representative results of inhbition are shown in the Table II. Table II:<br><br>
In vitro measurement of Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha (TNF-cO<br>
This assay determines the effect of test compounds on the production of TNF-a in human PerÎ²heral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC). Compounds were tested<br><br>
for their ability to inhibit the activity of TNF-a in human PBMC. PBMC were isolated from blood (from healthy volunteers) using BD Vacutainer CPTâ¢ (Cell preparation tube, BD Bio Science) and suspended in RPMI medium (Physiol. Res. 52: 593-598, 2003). The test compounds were pre-incubated with PBMC (0.5million/incubation well) for 15 minutes at 37Â°C and then stimulated with LÎ²opolysacchaR1de (EscheR1chia colt B4; 1 |uig/ml) for 18 hours at 37 Â°C in 5% C02. The levels of TNF-a in the cell culture medium were estimated using enzyme linked Immunosorbent assay performed in a 96 well format as per the procedure of the manufacturer (R&amp;D Systems, Inc. 614 McKinley Place NE, Minneapolis, MN 55413, USA). Representative results of TNF-a inhibition are shown in Table III. Table III;<br><br>
In vitro measurement of Interleukin-6 (IL-6) &amp; Interleukin-IB IIL1B)<br>
This assay determines the effect of test compounds on the production of IL-6 and IL1 Î² in human PBMC (Physiol. Res. 52: 593-598, 2003). Compounds were<br><br>
tested for their ability to inhibit the activity of IL-6 and IL1 p in human PBMC. PBMC were isolated from blood using BD Vacutainer CPT Cell preparation tube (BD Bio Science) and suspended in RPMI medium. The test compounds were pre-incubated with PBMC (0.5million/incubation well) for 15 minutes at 37Â°C and then stimulated with LÎ²opolysacchaR1de (EscheR1chia colt B4; 1 |ig/ml) for 18 hours at 37Â°C in 5% C02. The levels of IL-6 and IL1 p in cell culture medium were estimated using enzyme linked Immunosorbent assay performed in a 96 well format as per the procedure of the manufacturer (R&amp;D Systems, Inc. 614 McKinley Place NE5 Minneapolis, MN 55413, USA). Representative results of IL-6 and IL-lp inhibition are shown in Table IV.<br><br>
Carrageenan induced Paw Edema test in Rat<br>
The carrageenan paw edema test was performed as descR1bed by Winter et al (Proc.Soc.Exp.Biol.Med, 111, 544, 1962). Male wistar rats were selected with body weights equivalent within each group. The rats were fasted for eighteen hours with free access to water. The rats were dosed orally with the test compound suspended in vehicle containing 0.25% carboxymethylcellulose and 0.5% Tween 80. The câ¢trrÂ»1<br><br>
rats were administered with vehicle alone. After an hour, the rats were injected with 0.1 ml of 1% Carrageenan solution in 0.9% saline into the sub-plantar surface of the R1ght hind paw. Paw volume was measured using digital plethysmograph before and after 3 hours of carrageenan injection. The average of foot swelling in drug treated animals was compared with that of control animals. Anti-inflammatory activity was expressed as the percentage inhibition of edema compared with control group [Arzneim-Forsch/Drug Res., 43 (I), 1,44-50,1993; Otterness and Bliven, Laboratory Models for Testing NSAIDs, In Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs, (J. Lombardino, ed.1985)]. Representative results of edema inhibition are shown in Table V. Table V <br>
Ulcerogenic potential<br>
In order to evaluate compound's role on the ulcer formation, the animals were sacR1ficed and the stomach was taken out and flushed with 1% formalin. Animals (male wistar 200gm) were fasted for 18 hours free access to water and the test compounds were suspended in 0.5% Tween 80 and 0.25% CMC (carboxymethylcellulose) solution to make a uniform suspension. After 4 hours of oral administration of test compounds, all the animals were sacR1ficed by cervical dislocation. Dissect the stomach carefully and filled up with a steR1le saline solution and embedded in 6% formalin solution. Finally cut the stomach longnitudinaly and ulcer lesions were observed with computeR1zed stereomicroscope. Compare the test<br><br>
compound treated groups with the vehicle treated groups.   Dose selected: 50, 100, 200mg/kg (Marco Romano et al, Journal of clinical Investigation, 1992; 2409-2421)<br>
Inhibitory Action on Adjuvant ArthR1tis in rats<br>
Compounds were assayed for their activity on rat adjuvant induced arthR1tis model according to Theisen-Popp et al., (Agents Actions, 42, 50-55,1994). Six to seven weeks old, wistar rats were weighed, marked and assigned to groups [a negative control group in which arthR1tis was not induced (non-adjuvant control), a vehicle-treated arthR1tis control group, test substance treated arthR1tis group]. Adjuvant induced arthR1tis was induced by an injection of 0.1ml of MycobacteR1um butyR1cum (Difco) suspended in mineral oil (5mg/ml) into the sub-plantar region of the R1ght hind paw (J.Pharmacol.Exp.Ther., 284, 714, 1998). Body weight, paw volumes were measured at vaR1ous days (0, 4, 14, 21) for all the groups. The test compound or vehicle was administered orally beginning post injection of adjuvant ('O'day) and continued for 21 days (pretreatment group). In post treatment group, the test compound or vehicle was administered starting from day 14th to 21st day. On day 21, body weight and paw volume of both R1ght and left hind paw were taken. Spleen, and thymus weights were determined. In addition, the radiographs of both hind paws were taken to assess the tibio-tarsal joint integR1ty. Hind limb below the stifle joint was removed and fixed in 1% formalin saline for the histopathological assessment. At the end of the expeR1ment, serum samples were analysed for inflammatory mediators. The presence or absence of lesions in the stomach was also observed. Two-factor ('treatment5 and 'time') analysis of vaR1ance with repeated measures on 'time5 was applied to the percentage (%) changes for body weight and foot volumes. A post hoc Dunnett's test was conducted to compare the effect of treatments to vehicle control. A one-way analysis of vaR1ance was applied to the thymus and spleen weights followed by the Dunnett's test to compare the effect of treatments to vehicle.<br><br>
Dose-response curves for percentage inhibition in foot volumes on days 4, 14 and 21 were fitted by a 4-parameter logistic function using a nonlinear least Squares* regression. IC50 was defined as the dose corresponding to a 50% reduction compared to vehicle control and was deR1ved by interpolation from the fitted 4-parameter equation.<br>
LPS induced sepsis for measurement of TNF-q inhibition in mice<br>
The LPS induced sepsis model in mice was performed as descR1bed by Les sekut et al (J Lab Clin Med 1994; 124:813-20). Female Swiss albino mice were selected with their body weights being equivalent within each group. The mice were fasted for 20 hours with free access to water. The mice were dosed orally with the test compound suspended in vehicle containing 0.5% Tween 80 in 0.25% Carboxy-methylcellulose sodium salt. The control mice were administered the vehicle alone. After 30 minutes of oral dosing, the mice were injected with 500|ig of LÎ²opolysacchaR1de (EscheR1chia coli, LPS: B4 from Sigma) in phosphate buffer saline solution into the intrapeR1toneal cavity of the mice. After 90 minutes of LPS administration, the mice were bled via retro-orbital sinus puncture. Blood samples were stored overnight at 4Â°C. Serum samples were collected by centR1fuging the samples at 4000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4Â°C. Immediately the serum samples were analysed for TNF-a levels, using commercially available mouse TNF-a ELISA kit (Amersham Biosciences) and assay was performed by the manufacturer instruction. Representative results of TNF-a inhibition are shown in Table VI. Table VI: <br><br><br>
Anti-cancer screen:<br>
ExpeR1mental drugs are screened for anti-cancer activity in three cell lines for their GI50, TGI and LC50 values (using five concentrations for each compound). The cell lines are maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. 96 well microtiter plates are inoculated with cells in 100 (aL for 24h at 37Â°C, 5% C02, 95% air and 100% relative humidity. 5000 HCT116 cells/well, 5000 NCIH460 cells/well, 10000 U251 cells/well and 5000 MDAMB231 cells/well are plated. A separate plate with these cell lines is also inoculated to determine cell viability before the addition of the compounds (T0). Addition of expeR1mental drugs<br>
Following 24 hours incubation, expeR1mental drugs are added to the 96 well plates. Each plate contains one of the above cell lines and the following in trÎ²licate: five different concentrations (0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 and 100 (iM) of four different compounds, appropR1ate dilutions of a cytotoxic standard and control (untreated) wells. Compounds are dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to make 20 mM stock solutions on the day of drug addition and frozen at -20Â°C. SeR1al dilutions of these 20 mM stock solutions are made in complete growth medium such that 100 \xL of these drug solutions in medium, of final concentrations equaling 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 and 100 Î¼M can be added to the cells in trÎ²licate. Standard drugs whose anti-cancer activity has been well documented and which are regularly used are doxorubicin and SAHA.<br><br>
End-point measurement<br>
Cells are incubated with compounds for 48 hours followed by the addition of 10 \xL 3-(4,5-Dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-dÎ²henyl-2H-tetrazolium (MTT) solution per well and a subsequent incubation at 37Â°C, 5% C02, 95% air and 100% relative humidity, protected from light. After 4 hours, well contents are aspirated carefully followed by addition of 150 Î¼L DMSO per well. Plates are agitated to ensure solution of the formazan crystals in dimethylsulphoxide and absorbance read at 570 nm.<br>
Calculation of GI50, TGI and LC50<br>
Percent growth is calculated for each compound's concentration relative to the control and zero measurement wells (T0; viability R1ght before compound addition). If a test well's O.D. value is greater than the T0 measurement for that cell line % Growth = (test - zero) / (control - zero) X 100<br>
If a test well's O.D. value is lower than the T0 measurement for that cell line, then<br>
% Growth = (test - zero) / zero X 100<br>
Plotting % growth versus expeR1mental drug concentration, GI50 is the concentration required to decrease % growth by 50%; TGI is the concentration required to decrease % growth by 100% and LC50 is the concentration required to decrease % growth by 150%. Representative results of growth are shown in Table VII and VIII.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
