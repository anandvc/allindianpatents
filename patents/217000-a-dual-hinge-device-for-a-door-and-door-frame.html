				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a dual hinge device for a door and door frame.<br>
Conventionally, a door has a hinge or hinges disposed on one side thereof connecting the door to the door frame, thus enabling the door to be opened or closed with respect to the door frame on tlie said side.<br>
Often, the need arises to hinge the door on both sides thus permitting the door to be opened or closed, by choice, on one side or on the other.<br>
Such a need may arise in the case of, say, a refrigerator which has to be kept in a comer of a room where it may not be convenient to open the door of the refrigerator on one side because it may foul against a wall of the room, but where it may be convenient to open the door on the other side<br><br>
because there is no wall of the room to be encountered on that side.<br>
In such event if the door of the refrigerator could be opened on one side or the other, by choice, there would be no restriction in placing the refrigerator, say, in any desired comer of tlie room, or anywhere else in a convenient place in a room because the door of the refrigerator could be opened on either side, that is, in either direction without fouling with any object in the room.<br>
Needless to say, the device proposed herein can be used for any object or structure, such as, a cupboard or a door way.<br>
Accordingly, this invention proposes a dual hinge device for enabling a door to be opened, at will, on one side or the other.<br><br>
Various features and advantages of the device proposed herein will be apparent from a further description thereof given hereunder.<br>
The dual hinge device for a door and door frame, according to this invention, comprises at least two primary arcuate members attached respectively to the two sides of the door; at least two socket members attached respectively to the two sides of the door frame, each said socket member being provided with a slot and two rotatable secondary arcuate members separated by a gap, the slot being aligned with the gap in the closed position of the door, such that each primary arcuate member is snugly receivable in the said gap of the corresponding socket member and  such that when the door is sought to be opened from any one side, the primary arcuate member leaves the gap and the aligned slot of the corresponding socket member to<br><br>
enable the door to open, while the primary arcuate member of the socket member on the other side urges the secondary members thereof to rotatably move away to de-align the gap and the slot, and thus disable the door from opening on the said other side.<br>
This invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, which illustrate, by way of example, and not by way of limitation, one of various possible embodiments of the device proposed herein.<br>
Fig. 1 illustrating a box like object, such as a refrigerator fitted with four of the devices E to serve as four hinges. Figs 2 and 3 illustrating the said device E in exploded        view And<br><br>
Fig. 4 illustrating the manner in which the device operates as the door D is progressively opened, that is, progressively moved away from the door frame F, in the direction of the arrow A.<br>
The device E will be seen to comprise four primary arcuate members P attached respectively to the two sides of the door D.<br>
Four socket members M are attached respectively to the two sides of the door frame F each said socket member M being provided with a slot T and two rotatable secondary arcuate members Q separated by a gap G, the slot being aligned with the gap in the closed position of the door, such that each primary arcuate member is snugly receivable in the said gap of the corresponding socket member and such that when the door is sought to be opened from any one side, say, the side X the primary arcuate members leave the gaps and the aligned slots of the<br><br>
corresponding socket members to enable the door to open on the side X.<br>
In such event the primary arcuate members of the socket members on the other side Y urge the secondary members thereof to rotatably move away and de-align the gaps and slots, to disable the door from opening on the said other side Y since the said primary arcuate members are unable to leave the gaps and slots, which are now de-aligned, and thus act like hinges on the said other side Y.<br>
Similarly, when the door is sought to be opened from the side Y, the same operation takes place conversely, with the primary arcuate members on the said side X acting as hinges.<br><br>
The terms and expressions herein are of description and not of limitation, but it is understood that various other embodiments of the device proposed herein are possible without departing from the scope and ambit of this invention.<br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
I.A dual hinge device for a door and door frame comprising at least two primary arcuate members attached respectively to the two sides of the door; at least two socket members attached respectively to the two sides of the door frame, each said socket member being provided with a slot and two rotatable secondary arcuate members separated by a gap, the slot being aligned with the gap in the closed position of the door, such that each primary arcuate member is snugly receivable in the said gap of the corresponding socket member and such that when the door is sought to be opened from any one side, the primary arcuate member leaves the gap and the aligned slot of the corresponding socket member to enable the door to open, while, simultaneously, the primary arcuate member of the socket member on the other side<br><br>
urges the secondary members thereof to rotatably move away to de-align the gap and the slot, and thus disable the door from opening on the said other side.<br>
2.A dual hinge device for a door and door frame substantially as herein described with reference to, and as illustrated in, the accompanying drawings.</td>
