The following specification describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br><br>
 1<br>
GRANTED<br>
27-8-2007<br><br>
Technical field of the invention:<br>
The present invention is concerned with topical immunotherapy and compositions suitable for use therein.<br>
Background and Prior Art:<br>
Topicai irnmunorfierapy can be used to describe topical treatment with an agent having immunomodulatory properties. Recently, topical formulations including agents with direct immunosuppressive actions have been tested in diseases believed to have an immunological basis, especially atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. These topical immunosuppressive agents have included tacrolimus and structurally related asomycin derivatives.<br>
Tacrolimus is a hydrophobic macrolide immunosuppressant produced by Streptomyces tsukubaensis No. 9993. Tacrolimus, 17-allyl-l,14-dihydroxy-12-[2-(4- hydroxy-3 -methoxycyclohexyl)- 1 -methlvthyl]-23,25-dimethoxy- 13,19,21 ,27-tetramethyl- 11 ,28-dioxa-4-azatricyclo 22.3.1.04'9] octacos-18-ene-2,3,10, 16-tetraone, which is also known as FK-506 or FR-9005Q6, has the following structural formula:<br>
2<br><br><br>
Tacrolimus inhibits T-lymphocyte activation by first binding to an intracellular protein, FKBP-12. A complex of tacrolimus-FKBP-12, calcium, cadmodulin and calcineunn is then formed and the phosphatase activity of calcineurin is inhibited. The effect has been shown to prevent the dephosphorylation and translocation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT), a nuclear component thought to initiate gene transcription for the formation of lymphokines (such as interleukin-2, gamma interferon). Tacrolimus also inhibits the transcription for genes which encode IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, GM-CSF and TNF-alpha, all of which are involved in the early stages of T-cell activation. Tacrolimus inhibits proliferation and selective cytokine expression in antigen stimulated T cells in culture and also inhibits B cell proliferation at similar concentrations. Immunosuppression with tacrolimus in humans prevents allograft rejection.<br>
3<br><br>
More particularly, tacrolimus inhibits T-lymphocyte activation, having a direct effect on T-lymphocytes so as to inhibit IL-2 transcription, which decreases responsiveness of T-lymphocytes to foreign antigens. The action of tacrolimus on atopic dermatitis may be related to alteration of antigen presenting cells, suppression of IL-2 and co-stimulatory molecule expression, impairment of phenotypic and functional differentiation of epidermal Langerhans' cells and suppression of Thl and Th2 cytokine induction in lymph node cells. The effect of tacrolimus on pruritis may be related to inhibition of histamine release from skin mast cells and impairment of de novo mast cell prostaglandin D2 synthesis along with diminished release of histamine from basophiles.<br>
Immunosuppression with tacrolimus in humans prevents allograft rejection. Tacrolimus is also reported as being used in the treatment of rejection in transplantation and autoimmune diseases, and is routinely used in transplantation of for example, the kidney, liver or heart.<br>
Tacrolimus is available in both intravenous and oral formulation for the prevention of organ rejection after allogeneic liver or kidney transplantation. Oral tacrolimus has been found to be useful in the treatment of psoriasis, but potentially serious side effects, such as nephrotoxicity and hypertension, has limited its use for dermatologic indications by this route of administration. Topical formulations (ointments) have been extensively studied and reported to show positive effects in treatment of inflammatory skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. Tacrolimus administered topically (as an ointment) has been reported to be safe and effective in the treatment of skin diseases. It has been further reported that in patients with atopic dermatitis, tacrolimus does not alter collagen synthesis and is not atrophogenic.<br>
US Patent Application 2002052407, US Patent 6187756, US Patent 6184248 and WO 98/09523 describe compositions of tacrolimus for use in neurological disorders and neurogenerative diseases.<br>
4<br><br>
EP 1092429 discusses pharmaceutical compositions and methods for treating immune response associated disorders.<br>
US Patent Applications 2002173516 and 2002013340 describe pharmaceutical compositions and methods for treating immune response associated diseases of the surface and anterior segment of the eye.<br>
EP 1067926 and WO 99/5 1215 describe the use of tacrolimus as showing inhibitory activity on the production of nitric oxide.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that an immunosuppressant, such as tacrolimus, may be useful for the treatment of dermatophytoses and related disorders. Dermatophytoses are infectious diseases caused by a group of keratinophilic, parasitic fungi known as "dermatophytes". Dermatophyte infection can affect various keratinous tissues, such as the hair and stratum corneum of the skin causing areas of hair loss, scaliness and cutaneous and nail infection, including onychomycosis and various forms of tinea, epidermomycosis or epidermephytosis.<br>
Dermatophyte infection can thus affect the nails of a sufferer. Nails function primarily to protect the tender fingertip and to facilitate manipulation of small items thereby. Nail adornment preparations generally aim to protect and maintain the nail structure from microbial exposure that can lead to nail infection and disease. Common adornment preparations available in the market for fingernails and toenails can include nail enamel, nail hardener, nail enamel remover, cuticle remover, nail white, nail bleach, nail polish dryer, nail buffering cream, nail moisturizer and other nail treatment products. Of the above preparations, nail enamel, nail hardener, nail enamel remover, cuticle remover, nail white, nail buffering cream and nail moisturizer, are more commonly used.<br>
Nail enamel prevents contact of detergents with the nail, acting as a protectant. Furthermore, nail enamel can decrease nail water vapor loss from about 1.6 mg/cm to 0.4 mg/cm which can enhance moisturization and flexibility.<br>
5<br><br>
Nail hardeners are used to increase the strength of brittle nails caused by nail plate dehydration, often resulting from excessive contact with solvents, detergents and water.<br>
Nail polish removers are liquids designed to strip the nail polish from the nail plate, and often include strong solvents and conditioning substances. These substances are thought to act as occlusive nail moisturizers retarding water evaporation.<br>
Nail moisturizers are valuable in patients with thy, brittle, fissured and / or splitting nails. The healthy nail contains about 16% water, becoming soft with saturation at 30%. The water content of nail keratin is proportional to the relative humidity, being 7% at 20% relative humidity and 30% at 100% relative humidity.<br>
Nail moisturizers are usually creams or lotions that contain occlusives which increase the water binding capacity of the nail plate.<br>
Although compositions according to the present invention can include ingredients hitherto present in nail adornment compositions, compositions according to the present invention provide in addition to a decorative effect, also a therapeutic effect against immune disorders of keratinous tissue, such as the skin, hair and nails. In particular, the present invention can provide therapeutic treatment of dermatophytoses, which as used herein denotes dermatophyte infection of keratinous tissue, such as the skin, hair and nails, including onychomycosis, various forms of tinea and also epidermomycosis or epidennephytosis.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention discloses a pharmaceutical composition formulated for topical<br>
    application to an area of keratinous tissue exhibiting dermatophyte infection, or<br>
