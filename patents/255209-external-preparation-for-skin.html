Methods for liposomal encapsulation are not particularly limited, andare described, forexample, inJapanese Laid-open Patent Application No. 11-199488, etc.<br>
When prepared as aqueous solutions such as lotions, or creams (ointments), in order to prevent degradation of 5-aminolevulinic acid or its salt or a derivative of them, it is preferred to prepare the external preparation for skin while paying attention not to cause alkalinization. In case of alkalinizat ion, degradat ion can be prevent ed by removing oxygen. Paying attention to this, 5-aminolevulinic acid or its salt or a derivative of them can be used in combination with components of liquids or ointments usually used.<br><br>
Though there is no particular limitation to the method<br>
For using an external preparation for skin of the present invention,<br><br>
it is preferred that the external preparation for skin of the present invention is transdermally administered to the skin by methods such as spraying, application, or a. poultice. In addition, transdermaladministrationusing a drug delivery system such as iontophoresis is preferred because it promotes the speed of drug absorption into skin tissues and increases the ratio of drug absorption, as well.<br>
There is no particular limitation to the method for using a set of external preparations for skin of the present invention, and the following methods can be adapted: a method comprising mixing the first agent and the second agent together, and apply ing the mixture to the skin; a method comprising applying the first agent and the second agent to the skin at the same time; a method comprising applying the first agent to the skin and then applying the second agent to the same part; and a method comprising the second agent to the skin and then applying the first agent to the same part. Further, though the method comprising administering the first agent and the second agent is not particularly limited, methods such as spraying, application, or a poultice to the skin, or methods using a drug delivery system such as iontophoresis are preferred.<br>
With regard to the dosage of the external preparation for skin of the present invention, and the first agent and the second agent of the set of external preparations for skin of the present invention, there is no particular limitation as long as it is a level exerting an effect on skin roughness etc. However, in case of application to the skin, it is preferred to administer the external preparation for skin such that 5-aminolevulinic acid or its salt and a derivative of them is<br>
administered in an amount of 10 µg to 10 mg, desirably 100 µg<br><br>

The present invention will be described more specifically with reference to the Examples, however, the technical scope of thepresent invention is not limited to the see xemplifications . <br>
Example 1<br>
1. 5 g of 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride, 3 g of urea and 1 g of ferrous citrate were mixed well into 20 ml of purified water inwhich4%of 1,3-butyleneglycolandO.15%of methylparaben had been dissolved, to prepare the formulation example 1 was<br>
prepared.<br><br>
About 2 ml of the formulation example 1 was applied every night to faces of subjects (8 adult women) . After application, the faces were left for 30 minutes to 1 hour, and then the faces were washed in the same night, to rinse off the formulation example. <br>
The conventional strict light shielding conditions, applied when 5-aminolevulinic acids are used alone, were not performed, andhair removal occurringwhen the dosage ispartially excessive was not observed. The formulation example 1 was evaluated 5 days after the start of the application by each of 8 subjects. The results are shown below.<br>
Subject 1: only the right half of the face was treated with the formulation example 1, and the skin at the treated part became resilient and the dryness was ameliorated. In addition, the treated cheek (the cheek on the left side of Fig. 1) was lifted up in comparison to the cheek without treatment. Subject 2: the skin became resilient. The nasolabial folds that run from the nose to the both sides of the mouth became less prominent. When the formulation example 1 was being applied longer, the secretion of sebum increased, and dry skin was ameliorated. Makeup was put on in a better state. Subjects:theskinbecameresilient. Thenasolabialfoldsbecame less prominent. Crow' s feet disappeared. Makeup was put on in a better state.<br>
Subject 4: the skin became resilient. The complexion became fairer.<br>
Subjects: the skinbecame resilient. Dry skin was ameliorated. Makeup was put on in a better state.<br>
Subjects:theskinbecameresilient. Theskinbecamemoisturized. Subject 7: there was no special change. Subject 8: there was no special change.<br>
As described above, 6 out of 8 subjects noticed subjective<br>
symptoms showing amelioration of skin condition, for example, skin resilience. As it can be seen from the comment of subject 2, the external preparation for skin of the present invention has an effect on promoting the secretion of sebum, and it is consideredthat, asaresultof that, itexertsef f ect son improving skin resilience, ameliorating dry skin, and making nasolabial folds less prominent, etc. With regard to subject 1, who is a patient of atopic dermatitis, the skin became resilient and the dryness was ameliorated. Consequently, it is suggested that the external preparation for skin of the present invention is also effective for prevention/amelioration of skin roughness, dry skin, wrinkles, and sagging of skin resulted from atopic dermatitis. In addition, an effect on making complexion fairer, as in the case of subject 4, was observed as well. Example 2<br>
The formulation example 1 in Example 1 was applied once every night to affected areas of 6 patients of atopic dermatitis (subjects 9 to 13; and subject 1 in Example 1) , and 2 patients of chronic eczema (subjects 14 to 15) in an amount of about 1 ml per 100 cm2 of skin. After application, the affected areas were left for 30 minutes to 1 hour, and then the areas to which the formulation example 1 was applied were washed in the same night to rinse off the formulation example . The affected areas, 1, 2 weeks after the start of the administrationof the formulation example 1, were compared with the affected areas before the administration, and the judgment and the evaluation of "markedly ameliorated" "ameliorated" "no change" and "worsened" were conducted by the inventor, who is a doctor. The judgment and evaluation were conducted using the levels of amelioration of redness, pigmentation and itching of the skin, and the level<br>
of softening of the skin, as an indicator. As a result, 4 out<br><br>
of 6 patients of atopic dermatitis were "markedly ameliorated" and the other 2 patients were "ameliorated", and 1 out of 2 patients of chronic eczema was "markedly ameliorated" and the other patient was "ameliorated". Based on this result, it is shown that the external preparation for skin of the present invention ameliorates not only atopic dermatitis but also skin conditions such as eczema and dyskeratosis.<br>
Hereinafter, 3 out of 8 patients of atopic dermatitis will be described in more detail. Subject 1: "ameliorated"<br>
Subject 1 has been suffering from atopic dermatitis . Only the right half of the face was treated with the formulation example 1, and the skin at the treated part became resilient and the dryness was ameliorated. In addition, the skin at the treated part became soft and the treated cheek was lifted up in comparison to the cheek without treatment. Subject 9: "markedly ameliorated"<br>
Subject 9 has been suffering from atopic dermatitis since elementary school, and has been using external preparations of steroid intermittently for several decades. Major affected areas are the face and neck. In the affected areas, the skin was hard and exhibited redness and pigmentation (see Fig. 2, the left photograph of the face) , and was accompanied by itching, and a typical atopy-like appearance was observed. Subject 9 was instructed to use the formulation example 1 together with an external preparation of steroid, and 3 days later, the external preparation of steroid was discontinued because the itching disappeared. After that, only the formulation example 1 was used, and the redness and pigmentation in the affected areas were ameliorated, and the skin became soft (see Fig. 2, the rightphotographoftheface). Further, theconditionsofwrinkles<br>
and flecks of the skin were also ameliorated.<br>
Subject 10: "markedly ameliorated"<br>
Subject 10 has been suffering from atopic dermatitis since elementary school, and has been using external preparations of steroid intermittently for several decades. Major affected areas are the underarm and inside of the elbow. In the affected areas, there was itching, and the skin was hard and exhibited redness, pigmentation and scratches [see the left photographs of Fig. 3 (the inside of the elbow) and Fig. 4 (the underarm) ] , and a typical atopy-like appearance was observed. Subject 10 was instructed to use the formulation example 1 together with an external preparationof steroid, and 3 days later, the external preparation of steroid was discontinued because the itching disappeared. After that, only the formulation example 1 was used, and the redness and pigmentation in the affected areas were ameliorated, the skin became soft and the appearance of the skin became nearly normal [see the right photographs of Fig. 3 (the inside of the elbow) and Fig. 4 (the underarm) ] .<br>
