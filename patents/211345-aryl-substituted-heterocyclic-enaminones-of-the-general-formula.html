FORMULA"<br>
BAYER AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT, a German company, of D-51368, Leverkusen, Germany,<br>
GRANTED<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br>
ORIGINAL<br>
997/MUM/2000                                                                                                    11 OCT 2007<br><br>

The invention relates to novel aryl-substituted heterocyclic enaminones, to a plurality of processes for their preparation, to intermediates, and to the use of the enaminones as crop protection agents, in particular as herbicides, acaricides, nematicides and insecticides.<br>
Certain carbocyclic enaminones which are substituted in the phenyl ring have already been disclosed as intermediates for antibacterially active quinolones (R. G. Glushkov, N. B. Marchenko, A. N. Padeiskaya, L. D. Shipilova, Pharm. Chem. J. (Engl. Transl.) 24, 460-465, (1990)). Also known are carbocyclic enaminones which are unsubstituted in the phenyl ring (M. V. Mezentseva, A. V. Kadushkin, L. M. Alekseeva, A. S. Sokolova, V. G. Granik, Pharm. Chem. J. (Engl. Transl.) 25, 858-864 (1991); G. M. Coppola, R. Damon, A. D. Kahle, M. J. Shapiro, J. Org. Chem. 46, 1221-1222, (1981); D. Brillon, G. Sauve, J. Org. Chem. 55, 2246-2249, (1990)). The use of these compounds as crop protection agents has hitherto not been described.<br>

The amount of the compositions or concentrates employed depends on the nature ai occurrence of the insects and on the medium. The optimum amount employed can 1 determined for the use in each case by a series of tests. In general, however, it sufficient to employ 0.0001 to 20% by weight, preferably 0.001 to 10% by weight, i the active compound, based on the material to be protected.<br>
Solvents and/or diluents which are used are an organochemical solvent or solve mixture and/or an oily or oil-like organochemical solvent or solvent mixture of lo volatility and/or a polar organochemical solvent or solvent mixture and/or water, ai if appropriate an emulsifier and/or wetting agent.<br>
Organochemical solvents which are preferably used are oily or oil-like solven having an evaporation number above 35 and a flashpoint above 30Â°C, preferab above 45Â°C. Substances which are used as such oily or oil-like water-insolub solvents of low volatility are appropriate mineral oils or aromatic fractions thereof, solvent mixtures containing mineral oils, preferably white spirit, petroleum and/ alkylbenzene.<br>
Mineral oils having a boiling range from 170 to 220Â°C, white spirit having a boilii range from 170 to 220Â°C, spindle oil having a boiling range from 250 to 350Â°

A stated amount of the preparation of active compound of the desired concentration is pipetted onto a standardized amount of synthetic feed. In 6 repetitions, in each case one larva (L3) of the army worm (Spodoptera frugiperda) is placed on the feed.<br>
After the desired period of time, the kill in % is determined. 100% means that all animals have been killed; 0% means that none of the animals have been killed.<br>
In this test, for example, the following compounds of the Preparation Examples show good activity: I-l-a-14.<br><br><br>

To produce a suitable preparation of active compound, 1 part by weight of active compound is mixed with the stated amounts of solvent and emulsifier, and the concentrate is diluted with emulsifier-containing water to the desired concentration.<br>
Soya bean shoots (Glycine max) are treated by being dipped into the preparation of active compound of the desired concentration and populated with Heliothis virescens caterpillars while the leaves are still moist.<br>
After the desired period of time, the kill in % is determined. 100% means that all caterpillars have been killed; 0% means that none of the caterpillars have been killed.<br>

Tetranychus test (OP resistent/dip treatment)<br>
Solvent:	30 parts by weight of dimethylformamide<br>
Emulsifier:	1 part by weight of alkylaryl polyglycol ether<br>
To produce a suitable preparation of active compound, 1 part by weight of active compound is mixed with the stated amounts of solvent and emulsifier, and the concentrate is diluted with emulsifier-containing water to the desired concentration.<br>
Bean plants (Phaseolus vulgaris) which are heavily infested by all stages of the common spider mite (Tetranychus urticae) are dipped into a preparation of active compound of the desired concentration.<br>
After the desired period of time, the kill in % is determined. 100% means that all spider mites have been killed; 0% means that none of the spider mites have been killed.<br>

Example<br>
Post-emergence test<br>
Solvent:	5 parts by weight of acetone<br>
Emulsifier:     1 part by weight of alkylaryl polyglycol ether<br>
To produce a suitable preparation of active compound, 1 part by weight of active compound is mixed with the stated amount of solvent, the stated amount of emulsifier is added and the concentrate is diluted with water to the desired concentration.<br>
Test plants of a height of 5 to 15 cm are sprayed with the preparation of active compound such that the particular amounts of active compound desired are applied per unit area. After 3 weeks, the degree of damage to the plants is rated in % damage in comparison to the development of the untreated control.<br>
The figures denote:<br>
0%	=	no effect (like untreated control)<br>
100%	=        total destruction<br>
In this test, for example, the compounds of Preparation Examples I-l-a-7, I-l-a-8, I-l-a-9 exhibit strong activity against weeds, and some of them are tolerated well by crop plants, such as, for example, wheat.<br><br><br>

Example<br>
Pre-emergence test<br>
Solvent:	5 parts by weight of acetone<br>
Emulsifier:     1 part by weight of alkylaryl polyglycol ether<br>
To produce a suitable preparation of active compound, 1 part by weight of active compound is mixed with the stated amount of solvent, the stated amount of emulsifier is added and the concentrate is diluted with water to the desired concentration.<br>
Seeds of the test plants are sown in normal soil and, after 24 hours, watered with the preparation of active compound. The amount of water per unit area is advantageously kept constant. The concentration of active compound in the preparation is immaterial, only the active compound application rate per unit area matters. After three weeks, the degree of damage to the plants is rated in % damage in comparison to the development of the untreated control.<br>
The figures denote:<br>
0%	=        no effect (like untreated control)<br>
