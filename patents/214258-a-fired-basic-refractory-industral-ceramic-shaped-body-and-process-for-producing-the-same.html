				<td>A Fired, Basic, Refractory, Industrial Ceramic<br>
Shaped Body And Process for Producing The Same<br>
The invention relates to a fired, basic, refractory, industrial<br>
ceramic, elasticized shaped body based on at least one resistor<br>
component such as magnesia and doloma. In addition, the<br>
invention relates to a process for producing the shaped body<br>
and to its use.<br>
Shaped bodies of the generic type are used as refractory<br>
lining, in particular in high-temperature processes involving<br>
attack by basic slag, e.g. in furnaces, tanks or vessels in the<br>
cement, lime, dolomite, magnesite, steel and nonferrous metals<br>
industries and also in the glass industry.<br>
Although a shaped body composed of a resistor component<br>
(hereinafter also referred to simple as resistor) such as MgO<br>
or CaO/MgO (doloma) has a high fire resistance and good<br>
chemical resistance, it is generally brittle because it has a<br>
relatively high modulus of elasticity (E) and an unfavorable<br>
shear modulus (G) . This has an adverse effect on, in<br>
particular, the dissipation of thermal stresses, the mechanical<br>
stressability and the thermal shock resistance (TSR). It is<br>
therefore desirable to set low elastic moduli because these are<br>
responsible for the thermomechanical durability.<br>
To increase the elasticity or to reduce the elastic moduli, it<br>
is known that it is possible to add an elasticizer component<br>
(hereinafter also referred to simply as elasticizer) to a mix<br>
for producing a shaped body or to add raw materials which<br>
generate the elasticizer in the mix during ceramic firing.<br><br>
For example, magnesia-chromite bricks or magnesia-spinel bricks<br>
which display usable shear moduli in the range from 8 to 12 GPa<br>
(gigapascal) are produced using chromium ores or synthetic<br>
spinel.<br>
Refractory bricks containing molten hercynite or molten<br>
zirconium oxide as elasticizer have a low elasticity but are<br>
ductile. The shear moduli are from about 15 to 20 GPa and<br>
therefore relatively high.<br>
These known elasticized, basic, refractory shaped bodies are<br>
evaluated, in particular, in respect of elasticity, desired<br>
deposit formation in a rotary tube furnace, redox resistance,<br>
alkali resistance, hydration resistance and disposability, with<br>
each of these known shaped bodies having, in terms of these<br>
properties, advantages and disadvantages, which can be seen<br>
from the following table:<br>
Table 1: Qualitative properties of known shaped bodies<br><br>
Magnesia-spinel bricks and magnesia-zirconia bricks form a<br>
stable deposit in a rotary tube furnace only with difficulty;<br>
they consequently have only limited usability in, for example,<br>
the sintering zone of a rotary tube furnace for cement.<br>
Although magnesia-hercynite bricks display good deposit<br><br>
formation (cf. Variation of Physical and Chemical Parameters as<br>
a Tool for the Development of Basic Refractory Bricks;<br>
Klischat, Hans-Jurgen, Dr.; Weibel, Guido - REFRATECHNIK GmbH,<br>
Germany in Unified International Technical Conference on<br>
Refractories, PROCEEDINGS, 6th Biennial Worldwide Congress in<br>
conjunction with the 42nd International Colloquium on<br>
Refractories, Refractories 2000, BERLIN - Germany 6-<br>
9 September 1999, 50 Years German Refractory Association; pages<br>
204-207), they have a poor redox resistance and alkali<br>
resistance. The same applies to magnesia-chromite bricks which<br>
are additionally known to create disposal problems. Dolomite<br>
bricks containing no elasticizer do ensure very good deposit<br>
formation but are neither sufficiently alkali resistant nor<br>
sufficiently hydration resistant.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a basic,<br>
elasticized, refractory shaped body which combines high fire<br>
resistance and good chemical resistance with, in particular,<br>
good elasticity and good deposit formation capability, and good<br>
redox, alkali and hydration resistance and can be disposed of<br>
without problems.<br>
This object is achieved by a fired, basic, refractory,<br>
industrial ceramic shaped body comprising at least one basic<br>
resistor component and an elasticizer component, characterized<br>
in that the elasticizer component is a calcium aluminate having<br>
a CaO/Al2O3 ratio of from 0.14 to 0.2. Advantageous embodiments<br>
of the invention are defined in the subordinate claims and the<br>
other claims.<br>
According to the invention, sintered magnesia and/or fused<br>
magnesia or sintered doloma and/or fused doloma, selected from<br>
among the numerous known resistors, is/are used as basic<br>
resistor. Calcium aluminate having a CaO/Al2O3 ratio of from<br>
0.14 to 0.2, in particular of the chemical composition CaAl12O19<br>
having the oxide formula CaO-6Al2O3 or the abbreviated formula<br>
CA6, has been found as elasticizer.<br><br>
Calcium hexaaluminate has the chemical formula CaAl12O19 or the<br>
mineral name "hibonite" and the oxide formula CaO-6Al2O3 or the<br>
abbreviated formula CA6.<br>
The A12O3 of the CA6 obviously does not react with the alkali<br>
metal and calcium compounds, e.g. in the rotary tube furnace<br>
for cement, because it is already saturated with CaO. This<br>
results in a very good corrosion resistance. The CaO in the CA6,<br>
which is also the main constituent of the cement clinker<br>
material, probably ensures very effective deposit formation in<br>
the rotary tube furnace, which cannot be achieved even with the<br>
deposit-forming, known, elasticized, refractory shaped bodies<br>
such as magnesia-hercynite bricks or magnesia-chromite bricks.<br>
CA6 is not an unknown in refractory materials. A refractory<br>
shaped body whose mineral oxidic component is formed by a<br>
mineral phase mixture of ?-Al2O3, P-A12O3, CA6 and CA2 is known<br>
from DE 199 36 292 C2. The mineral phase mixture is said to<br>
increase the corrosion resistance of the shaped bodies. CA6 does<br>
not play an elasticizing role here.<br>
It is preferred that the shaped body comprises from 60 to 99.5%<br>
by mass of resistor component and from 0.5 to 40% by mass of<br>
elasticizer component. Preferably, at least one further<br>
elasticizer known per se is present. Further, it is preferred<br>
that the shaped body has an overall density of from 2.5 to<br>
3.2 g/cm3.<br>
Preferably, the shaped body has a porosity of from 12 to 25% by<br>
volume, in particular from 14 to 23% by volume. It is preferred<br>
that the shaped body has a cold compressive strength above<br>
35 MPa, in particular above 45 MPa, and a cold flexural<br>
strength above 2 MPa. Preferably, the shaped body has a modulus<br>
of elasticity of from 14 to 35 GPa, in particular from 15 to<br>
32 GPa, and a shear modulus of from 6 to 15 GPa, in particular<br>
from 7 to 14 GPa. It is further preferred that the shaped body<br><br>
has a thermal shock resistance of &gt;80.<br>
The shaped body according to the present invention is produced<br>
by a process which comprises mixing at least one resistor<br>
component with at least one CA6 elasticizer component and<br>
admixing the mixture with a binder and mixing it to form a<br>
shapeable composition, subsequently shaping the composition to<br>
produce bodies and drying the shaped bodies and then firing the<br>
bodies at high temperatures to sinter them.<br>
Preferably, drying is carried out at temperatures of from 100<br>
to 120°C.<br>
It is preferred that sintering is carried out at temperatures<br>
of from 1400 to 1700°C, in particular from 1550 to 1650°C. It<br>
is further preferred that from 60 to 99.5% by mass of resistor<br>
component and from 0.5 to 40% by mass of elasticizer component<br>
are used. Also it is preferred that at least one pre--<br>
synthesized elasticizer component is used. Preferably, a<br>
granulated mixture for the elasticizer component obtained by<br>
mixing appropriate raw materials is mixed with the resistor<br>
component and the elasticizer component is generated during<br>
firing.<br>
The invention is illustrated below with the aid of an example:<br>
Magnesia having a maximum particle size of 4 mm and a particle<br>
size distribution corresponding to a typical Fuller curve and<br>
the mineral calcium hexaaluminate having a particle size range<br>
from 0.5 to 4 mm were mixed, admixed with a required amount of<br>
lignin sulfonate as binder, shaped to form bricks and pressed<br>
at a specific pressing pressure of 130 MPa. After drying at<br>
110°C, the bricks were fired at a sintering temperature of<br>
1600°C in a tunnel kiln.<br>
The achieved properties of the fired bricks as a function of<br>
the amount of calcium hexaaluminate added are shown in table 2<br><br>
below. A magnesia brick fired in the same way was employed as<br>
comparison.<br>
Table 2: Properties of shaped bodies according to the<br>
invention compared to properties of a magnesia brick<br><br>
It can be seen from table 2 that the bricks according to the<br>
invention are sufficiently elasticized for use in a rotary tube<br>
furnace for cement with its temperature-dynamic conditions. The<br>
elastic moduli are within a very good range. The thermal shock<br>
resistance (TSR) is excellent.<br>
The mechanism which leads to the very good elasticization of<br>
the bricks has hitherto not been able to be determined<br>
unambiguously. There is presumably microcrack formation between<br>
the magnesia matrix and the calcium hexaaluminate during firing<br>
of the bricks, caused by the difference in the thermal<br>
expansion of these two materials.<br>
Table 3 below shows the individual relevant properties of the<br>
known shaped bodies of table 1 and those of the shaped bodies<br>
according to the invention.<br><br>
Table 3: Qualitative properties of known shaped bodies<br>
compared to a shaped body according to the invention<br><br>
Table 3 shows that all the types of brick known hitherto have<br>
significant disadvantages in terms of the application-relevant<br>
properties. In contrast, the magnesia-CA6 bricks of the<br>
invention have exclusively good properties, as have hitherto<br>
not been known in their use-relevant combination.<br>
Shaped bodies according to the invention can be used<br>
advantageously wherever severe temperature changes occur and<br>
wherever mechanical and thermomechanical stresses occur. These<br>
are, for example, sintering and transition zones of rotary tube<br>
furnaces in the brick and earth industry, in particular the<br>
cement, lime, dolomite and magnesite industries, ferrous and<br>
nonferrous metals industry and also melting and handling<br>
vessels in the iron or steel industry and the nonferrous metals<br>
industry. A shaped body according to the invention displays<br>
excellent use performance in respect of hydration, alkali,<br>
redox and corrosion resistance combined with good deposit<br>
formation tendency. It is thus also superior to the known<br>
products after use because of unproblematical disposal<br>
possibilities.<br><br>
The elasticization of the basic shaped bodies according to the<br>
invention can be achieved using not only pure calcium<br>
hexaaluminate, but it is also possible for secondary phases,<br>
e.g. SiO2 and/or TiO2 and/or Fe2O3 and/or MgO, to be present in<br>
amounts of up to 10% by mass in the calcium hexaaluminate.<br>
Furthermore, the calcium hexaaluminate also has the action<br>
described when up to 58% by mass of the A12O3 has been replaced<br>
by Fe2O3 or when Ca2+ has been partly replaced by Ba2+ or Sr2+, as<br>
indicated in "Trojer, F.: Die oxydischen Kristallphasen der<br>
anorganischen Industrieprodukte", E. Schweizerbart"sche<br>
