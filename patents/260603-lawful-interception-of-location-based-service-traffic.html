"LAWFUL   INTERCEPTION    OF   LOCATION   BASED   SERVICE TRAFFIC"<br>
TELEFONAKTIEBOLAGET L M ERICSSON (publ), a Swedish company of SE-164 83, Stockholm (SE)<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
WO 2006/011165	PCT/IT2004/000417<br>
LAWFUL INTERCEPTION OF LOCATION BASED SERVICE TRAFFIC Technical field<br>
The  present   invention  relates  to  methods   and  arrangements   in  a telecommunication system to generate Interception Related Information related to 5     location services involving a mobile subscriber/equipment who/which is target for lawful interception. Background Art<br>
Three major trends currently occurs in telecommunication, i.e. 1) increasing amount of data traffic, 2) real-time communication goes from circuit switching to 10 packet switching, and 3) new focus of real-time in packet switching, for example video and multimedia. The ever increasing amount of data traffic as well as real-time communication in packet switched networks has lead to a demand for monitoring of " this data traffic with the same level of security and confidentiality as known from circuit switched networks monitoring.<br>
15	One kind of monitoring is lawful interception, i.e. the act of intercepting a<br>
communication on behalf of a Law Enforcement Agency. Interception of Content of Communication CC i.e. speech and data is known. Interception of Intercept Related Information IRI is also known. Intercept Related Information is defined as signaling information related to target subscribers, for example call establishment. As an<br>
2	0     example, in Circuit Switching domain, the sending of IRI to a monitoring function is<br>
triggered by the following call-related and non-call related events:<br>
-	Call Establishment<br>
-	Answer<br>
-	Supplementary Service<br>
25           -	Handover<br>
-	Release<br>
-	SMS<br>
-	Location Update<br>
-	Subscriber Controlled Input<br>
3	0	Appropriate session related and session unrelated events trigger the sending of<br><br>
WO 2006/011165<br><br>
PCT/IT2004/000417<br><br>
t3<br>
IRI to a monitoring function in case of Packet Switching communication.<br>
Beyond the demand for monitoring of IRI and CC, demand for monitoring of IRI regarding location-based services is desired. The existing standardized location based services architecture can be found in the 3GPP specifications TS 23.271. 5 According to the related Standard, a Gateway Mobile Location center GMLC is the first node external Location Services LCS client requiring information, accesses in a mobile network. The GMLC requests routing information, handles positioning requests and forwards location estimates to the Location Services client. Mobile positioning enables an operator to provide location-based services to his customer. 10      Position procedures that can be used to obtain the location estimate are:<br>
-	Mobile Terminating Location Request, which is requested by a specific request sent from a Location Services client external to the network via a Gateway Mobile Location Center<br>
-	Mobile Originating Location Request, which is requested by the User Equipment<br>
15      -   Network Induced Location Request, which is triggered in case the User Equipment is performing an emergency call.<br>
Location-based services are forecasted to soon be one of the most important sources of operator revenue. The position can be used to provide mobile subscribers with information and services that take advantage of the given geographical location.<br>
20      The location estimates can also be used for charging and billing.<br>
According to current Lawful Interception standards, it is not possible to report, by means of existing Intercept Related Information events, the occurrence of traffic and information related to Location Services for a monitored subscriber/equipment. In order to monitor location-based services today, an agency<br>
2 5 should request the location based service provider with such detailed information, but a Lawful Interception Agency could be unaware of which providers are offering services to the target subscriber making it quite difficult to obtain such data from the telecommunication system.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
30	The present invention relates to problems how to integrate existing Location<br><br>
WO 2006/011165<br><br>
PCMT2004/000417<br><br>
Services architecture into Lawful Interception to provide Lawful Interception Agencies with accurate information related to positioning activities involving a monitored mobile subscriber/equipment.<br>
The problems are solved by the invention by generating new properly structured Interception Related Information related to location-based services/information.<br>
More in detail, the problems are solved by methods and arrangements in a telecommunication system to generate Interception Related Information related to positioning activities involving a mobile subscriber/equipment. The telecommunication system provides information to an Intercept configuration unit, collected from an Intercept Access Point that is associated to the monitored subscriber/equipment The method comprises the following steps:<br>
-	Receiving to the Intercept Access Point from the Intercept configuration unit, a request to monitor the mobile subscriber/equipment<br>
-	Registration in the Intercept Access Point, of a positioning activity involving the monitored subscriber/equipment<br>
-	Delivering information related to the positioning activity, from the Intercept Access Point to the Law Enforcement Agency.<br>
Advantages with the invention are:<br>
-	Possibility to provide Lawful Interception Agencies with accurate information related to Location Services traffic using resources already allocated in the network and without traffic disturbance of additional signaling<br>
-	Positioning information will be obtained without any intrusive mechanism or disturbance over the transaction established by the target<br>
-	Positioning information will be obtained without any ad-hoc generated Location Services traffic.<br>
The invention will now be described more in detail with the aid of preferred embodiments in connection with the enclosed drawings.<br>

Figure 1 discloses a Public Land Mobile Network PLMN1. The Network in<br>
10 this example is a GSM network and comprises a Gateway Mobile Location Center GMLC1 connected to a Mobile Subscriber Center MSC/VLR. The MSC/VLR includes a Visitor Location Register in which mobile subscribers that are visiting the MSC control area are registered. The Mobile Subscriber Center MSC/VLR is connected to a Base Station Controller BSC that is connected to a Radio Base Station<br>
15 RBS. The RBS covers a radio cell CELL in which a mobile subscriber/equipment MSA is located. The Base Station Controller BSC controls a group of Radio Base Stations (only RBS is shown in the figure), and the Mobil«| Subscriber Center MSC/VLR controls a number of Base Station Controllers (only BSC is shown in the figure). The GMLC1 contains functionality required to support location services. The<br>
20 GMLC1 is the first node an external Location Services client accesses in the PLMN. In figure 1 a Location Services Client LCS is schematically shown as directly connected to the GMLC1. A Home Location Register HLR is connected to both the MSC/VLR and to the GMLC1. The GMLC1 may request routing information to the mobile   subscriber/equipment   from  the  Home  Location  Register  HLR,   i.e.<br>
2 5 information about in which MSC/VLR the mobile is registered. Positioning requests are sent from the GMLC1 to the MSC/VLR. After registration authorization and possibly paging procedure, the MSC/VLR will handle the positioning procedure for the mobile subscriber, receive positioning information, and forward final location estimates to the GMLC. An Intercept Configuration Unit ICU is connected to the<br>
30      MSC/VLR in this example. The ICU is connected to the MSC/VLR via "three<br><br>
WO 2006/011165<br><br>
PCT/IT2004/000417<br><br>
interfaces XI, X2 and X3. The ICU and the interfaces will be further explained in figure 2.<br>
The Intercept Configuration Unit ICU is disclosed in figure 2. The ICU comprises at least one Law Enforcement Agency LEA (three blocks representing 5 different LEAs are shown in figure 2). Each LEA is connected to three Mediation Functions respectively for ADMF, DF2, DF3 i.e. an Administration Function ADMF and two Delivery Functions, a so-called second Delivery Function DF2 and third Delivery Function DF3. The Administration Function and the Delivery Functions are each one connected to the telecommunication network via the interfaces X1-X3. The 10      ADMF is connected via the interface XI, DF2 is connected via X2 and DF3 is<br>
connected via X3. The Administration Function ADMF is together with the delivery functions used to hide from the network that there might be multiple activations by the different Law Enforcement Agencies. The messages sent from the ADMF to the network via the XI interface comprise identities of the subscriber/equipment that is<br>
15 to be monitored, i.e. target identities. The second Delivery Function DF2 receives Intercept Related Information IRI from the network and DF2 is used to distribute the IRI to relevant Law Enforcement Agencies. The third Delivery Function DF3 receives Content of Communication CC, i.e. speech and data, and is used to distribute the CC to relevant LEAs. DF3 is responsible for call control signaling and<br>
20 bearer transport for an intercepted product. Intercept Related Information IRI, received by DF2, which also are called Events, are either call related or non-call related. Intercept Related Information IRI is defined as signaling information related to target subscribers. Call establishment is an example of a call related event and Location Update is an example of a non-call related event.<br>
2 5	According to a first embodiment of invention, the already existing events have<br>
been enhanced to include also monitoring of location-based services, i.e. information linked to positioning of a target subscriber/equipment. If a well specified positioning activity for a mobile subscriber/equipment occurs, an Intercept Access Point IAP, which in this first embodiment is the MSC/VLR, sends relevant data to DF2. This<br>
30     will later be explained more in detail. Examples of new different events .related to<br><br>
WO 2006/011165<br><br>
PCT/IT2004/000417<br><br>
positioning activities are as follows:<br>
-	Reception of a positioning request from an external client. This event is also<br>
called a first Mobile Terminating-Location Request MT-LR1. The event MT-<br>
LRl comprises reception of a positioning request to the Intercept Access Point<br>
5	from the Location Services client.<br>
-	Delivering of a location result to an external client. This event is also called a<br>
second Mobile Terminating-Location Request MT-LR2. The event MT-LR2<br>
comprises delivering of location result from the Intercept Access Point to the<br>
Location Services client.<br>
10 - Reception of a positioning request from a target subscriber/equipment. This event is also called a first Mobile Originating-Location Request MO-LR1. The event MO-LR1 comprises reception to the Intercept Access Point of a positioning request from the monitored mobile subscriber/equipment.<br>
-	Delivering of a location result to an external client. This event is also called<br>
15           Mobile Originating-Location Request MO-LR2. The event MO-LR2 comprises<br>
delivering of location result from the Intercept Access Point to the Location Services client.<br>
-	Delivering of a location result to a target subscriber/equipment. This event is also<br>
called a third Mobile Originating-Location Request MO-LR3. The event MO-<br>
20	LR3 comprises delivering of location result from the Intercept Access Point to<br>
the monitored mobile subscriber/equipment.<br>
-	Triggering of positioning request from a network. This event is also called a first<br>
Network Induced-Location Request NI-LRl. The event NI-LRl, as defined in<br>
the standards, is stated to be for emergency call, i.e triggered when CM Service<br>
25	Request  for  emergency  Services  is received  from the monitored  mobile<br>
subscriber/equipment.<br>
-	Delivering of location result to an Emergency Center. This event is also called a<br>
second Network Induced-Location Request NI-LR2. The event NI-LR2<br>
comprises delivering of location result from the Intercept Access Point to the<br>
30	Emergency Center.<br><br>
WO 2006/011165<br><br>
PCT/IT2004/000417<br><br>
It is to be observed that the above stated events only are examples of events related to location-based services that are possible to use in the invention.<br>
A method according to the first embodiment of the invention will now be explained more in detail. The explanation is to be read together with figures 1 and 2. 5     The method comprises the following steps:<br>
-	The Law Enforcement Agency LEA sends a request to the Administration<br>
Function ADMF to activate interception of the mobile subscriber/equipment<br>
MSA, i.e. to monitor MSA.<br>
-	The ADMF forwards a target identity of the mobile subscriber/equipment MSA,<br>
10           to the Intercept Access Point LAP, i.e. to the Mobile Subscriber Center<br>
MSC/VLR.<br>
-	A positioning request regarding the mobile subscriber/equipment MSA is sent<br>
from the external client LCS to the Gateway Mobile Location Center GMLC1.<br>
-	A request to provide subscriber location is sent from the Gateway Mobile<br>
15          Location Center GMLC1 to the Mobile Subscriber Center MSC/VLR. To send<br>
the request, the GMLC1 may need to request routing information to the MSA<br>
from the Home Location Register HLR, i.e. information about in which<br>
MSC/VLR the mobile is registered. The request sent from GMLC1 to MSC/VLR<br>
corresponds to the event MT-LRl - Reception of a positioning request from an<br>
20	external client.<br>
-	Upon receiving the event MT-LRl, the Mobile Subscriber Center MSC/VLR<br>
informs the Law Enforcement Agency LEA about the ongoing positioning<br>
activity by sending Interception Related Information IRI, i.e. the received event<br>
MT-LRl, via the interface X2 to the second Delivery Function DF2. The IRI is<br>
2 5	forwarded from DF2 to the LEA.<br>
-	If needed, the MSC/VLR sends a paging message to the mobile subscriber and<br>
receive positioning information. This method step is in accordance with the<br>
existing standardized location based services architecture.<br>
-	The positioning information received to the MSC/VLR is intended to be<br>
30	forwarded to the external client LCS and corresponds to the event MT-LR2 -<br><br>
WO 2006/011165<br><br>
PCT/IT2004/000417<br><br>
Delivering of a location result to an external client.<br>
-	Upon receiving the event MT-LR2, the Mobile Subscriber Center MSC/VLR<br>
forwards the positioning information to the Law Enforcement Agency LEA by<br>
sending the mobile subscriber/equipments geographical position via the interface<br>
X2 to the second DelivdryJFunction DF2. The geographical position is forwarded<br>
from DF2 to the LEA.<br>
As an alternative to the relative order of the above method steps different variations can be conceived. For example may the Intercept Related Information be sent to the LEA together with the geographical position upon receiving the event MT-LR2.<br>
Figure 3 discloses a flowchart in which some more important steps are shown. The flowchart is to be read together with the earlier shown figures. The flowchart comprises the following steps:<br>
-	The Law Enforcement Agency LEA sends a request to the Intercept Access Point, to activate interception of the mobile subscriber/equipment MSA. A block 101 discloses this step in figure 3.<br>
-	A positioning request regarding the mobile subscriber/equipment MSA is sent from the external client LCS to the to the Mobile Subscriber Center MSC/VLR. The request corresponds to the event MT-LR1. A block 102 discloses this step in figure 3.<br>
-	The Mobile Subscriber Center MSC/VLR informs the Law Enforcement Agency LEA about the ongoing position activity. A block 103 discloses this step in figure 3.<br>
-	Positioning information is received to MSC/VLR in accordance with the existing standardized location based services architecture. The positioning information received to the MSC/VLR corresponds to the event MT-LR2. A block 104 discloses this step in figure 3.<br>
-	The Mobile Subscriber Center MSC/VLR forwards mobile subscriber/equipments geographical position to the LEA. A block 105 discloses this step in figure 3.<br><br>
WO 2006/011165<br><br>
PCT/IT2004/000417<br><br>
A second embodiment of the invention will now be discussed where the Intercept Access Point IAP is in the Gateway Mobile Location Center GMLC1. Figure 4 discloses a telecommunication system comprising a first Public Land Mobile Network PLMNl which is the same network as was shown earlier in figure 5 1. The system also comprises a second Public Land Mobile Network PLMN2 comprising a Mobile Subscriber Center MSC2/VLR connected to a Base Station Controller BSC2 that is connected to a Radio Base Station RBS2. The RBS2 covers a radio cell CELL2 in which the same mobile subscriber/equipment MSA that was located in PLMNl in the first embodiment, now is located. The home network of the<br>
10 mobile subscriber/equipment MSA is PLMNl, and PLMN2 in this embodiment is a visited network. In this second embodiment the Gateway Mobile Location Center GMLC1 in PLMNl is acting as Intercept Access Point IAP, i.e. the Intercept Configuration Unit ICU is connected to the GMLC1. The ICU that earlier was explained together with figure 2 works in the same way in this second embodiment.<br>
15 A second Location Services client LCS2 is geographically located in the second Public Land Mobile Network PLMN2. This second embodiment deals with requiring information about the MSA and since PLMNl is MS As home network, LCS2 has to go via GMLC1 to receive information about MSA. LCS2 is schematically shown in figure 4 as directly connected to GMLC1. It is to be noted that the network<br>
20 configuration in the second embodiment is an example. The invention applies also to a GMLC in PLMN2 or even located in a third Public Land Mobile Network, different from PLMNl and PLMN2. Moreover the LCS2 can be in whatever PLMN: it could be in PLMNl, PLMN2 or in another PLMN, different from PLMNl and PLMN2.<br>
25	A method according to the second embodiment of the invention will now be<br>
explained more in detail. The explanation is to be read together with figures 2 and 4. The method comprises the following steps:<br>
-    The Law Enforcement Agency LEA sends a request to the Administration Function ADMF to activate interception of the mobile subscriber/equipment<br>
3 0	MSA, i.e. to monitor MSA.<br><br>
WO 2006/011165<br><br>
PCT/TT2004/000417<br><br>
-	The ADMF forwards a target identity of the mobile subscriber/equipment MSA,<br>
to the Intercept Access Point IAP, i.e. to the Gateway Mobile Location Center<br>
GMLCl.<br>
-	A positioning request regarding the mobile subscriber/equipment MSA is sent<br>
5	from the second Location Services client LCS2 to the Gateway Mobile Location<br>
Center GMLCl. The request sent from LCS2 to GMLCl corresponds to the event MT-LR1 - Reception of a positioning request from an external client.<br>
-	Upon receiving the event MT-LR1, the Gateway Mobile Location Center<br>
GMLCl informs the Law Enforcement Agency LEA about the ongoing position<br>
10	activity by sending Interception Related Information IRI, i.e. the received event<br>
MT-LR1, to the second Delivery Function DF2. The IRI is forwarded from DF2 to the LEA.<br>
-	A request to provide subscriber location is sent from the Gateway Mobile<br>
Location Center GMLCl to the Mobile Subscriber Center MSC2/VLR. To send<br>
15	the request, the GMLCl may need to request routing information to the MSA<br>
from the Home Location Register HLR, i.e. information about in which Mobile Subscriber Center the mobile is registered.<br>
-	The MSC2/VLR sends a paging message to the mobile subscriber and receive<br>
positioning information. This method step is in accordance with the existing<br>
2 0	standardized location based services architecture.<br>
-	The positioning information received to the MSC2/VLR is to be forwarded to the<br>
external client LCS2. The information is sent from MSC2/VLR to GMLCl and<br>
then forwarded to LCS2. This corresponds to the event MT-LR2 - Delivering of<br>
a location result to an external client.<br>
25 - Upon receiving the event MT-LR2, the Gateway Mobile Location Center GMLCl forwards the positioning information to the Law Enforcement Agency LEA by sending the mobile subscriber/equipments geographical position to the second Delivery Function DF2. The geographical position is thereafter forwarded from DF2 to the LEA.<br>
It is to be noted that the earlier shown events MO-LR3, NI-LR1 and NI-LR2<br><br>
WO 2006/011165<br><br>
PCT/IT2004/000417<br><br>
preferably apply to the first embodiment.<br>
Different variations are possible within the scope of the invention. The Intercept Access Point IAP may for example be another node type than the ones in the described embodiments. The Intercept Access Point can for example be a Serving GPRS Support Node. The invention is applicable in both circuit switched (connection oriented) and packet switched (connection less) networks. The disclosed GSM network/access in the described embodiments is just an example of a network/access that can be used. Other examples would be a 3G WCDMA network, IP Multimedia Subsystem and Wireless LAN access.<br>
The invention is in other words of course not limited to the above described and in the drawings shown embodiments but can be modified within the scope of the enclosed claims.<br><br>
