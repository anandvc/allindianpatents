Introduction to the Field of Invention<br>
This invention relates to an improved me:hod and a packaging system for plant based biological<br>
material.<br>
The invention more particularly relates to an improved modified atmosphere control temperature<br>
packaging method and system for materials like fruits, vegetables, mushrooms and medicinal<br>
plants and similar materials.<br>
Prior Art<br>
It is already known to pack bio-logical materials like fruits, vegetables, mushrooms and<br>
medicinal plants and similar materials to I eep them fresh and maintain the freshness for as long a<br>
time as possible.<br>
It is also known, that when these materials are packed in suitable packages, changes take place<br>
within the packages, which decide the con ditions and length of time for keeping the packed<br>
materia] fresh.<br>
Objects of the Invention<br>
It is a principal object of the invention to propose improved packing method/conditions for<br>
keeping the freshness of packed biological materials.<br>
It is another object of this invention to propose a packaging system for biological material like<br>
fruits, vegetables and medicinal plants and similar materials.<br>
Yet another object is to propose such a sys em which can cater to the need of various categories<br>
or cross section of users such as retailers stores, exporters, wholesale dealers and even<br>
households.<br>
These and other objects will be apparent from the following paragraphs.<br>
Basis for Investigations<br>
We have experimented with a selected few materials and have found satisfactory results. It is<br>
however not restricted to the few experimented items only. A large varieties of items having<br>
similar biological behavior can be successfully packed in the improved packing system under<br>
modified atmosphere and controlled tempeiature.<br><br>
To arrive at a favourable packaging sys:em, we have taken into consideration, several factors like<br>
the respiration of the packed materials, -ate and prolongation of the respiration activity,<br>
utilization of oxygen within the system ind increase in carbon-di-oxidc production, alteration in<br>
the Respiration Quality (RQ) and the metabolic activities under controlled temperature.<br>
We have conducted experiment with se\eral fruits and give below the details for litchi and<br>
sapotas.<br>
Brief Statement of the Invention<br>
According to this invention a method has been provided for the preservation of the freshness of<br>
materials like fruits/vegetables and simihr materials comprising the following steps.<br>
a.	Harvesting the materials from the plant at the proper stage of maturity and with a small<br>
position of stem.<br>
b.	Sorting the same according to the size, maturity and colour for uniform segregation.<br>
c.	Pre-treating the uniformly segregated materials with a chemical solution containing<br>
sodium benzoate and/or chlorine vater.<br>
d.	draining the treating solution<br>
e.	surface drying the pre-treated material with or without fumigating with sulfur vapour<br>
f.	pre-cooling the dry material to temperature in the range of 2-5°C in a container followed<br>
by<br>
g.	packing the same in LDPE packages and sealing the packed packages, whore after<br>
h. the packed materials are stored at temperature of 8±2°C and RH of 80-90%<br>
The materials are harvested without damage which are to be stored to avoid exudation of liquid if<br>
any.<br>
The pre-treating solution is preferably mads of 250 ppm of sodium benzoate and 5 ppm of<br>
chlorine water.<br><br>
The pre-treated material is surface d ied when these fruits preferably by burning sulfur in a fume<br>
chamber using preferably less than C.05 by weight of sulfur based on the weight of<br>
fruits/medicinal plants.<br>
The pre-cooling is carried out prefera bly at temperature of 4-5°C within an hour.<br>
The packing packet is made of LDPE film of about 200 gauge.<br>
The materials are loosely packed keeping at least 20% head space inside the packet in the scaled<br>
condition.<br>
If desired the interior of the sealed packets are flushed off ethylene by using inside the package<br>
an ethylene scavenger like KMn04 sol ation absorbed in a suitable surface like asbestos libers.<br>
The fruits are selected from various caiegories like litchis, sapotas, lemons, mangoes and guavas.<br>
The materials include edible materials selected from mushrooms, cabbages, bracoli red, cabbage.<br>
capsicum, green chili, grains.<br>
The materials include medicinal plants ncluding pan leaves, mint citronella and lemon grass<br>
eucalyptus barks and leaves cardamom amd others, which are a source for volatile aromatic oils.<br>
The invention will now be more fully described w.'th reference to the following two examples<br>
relating to fruits but is equally applicable to all other materials mentioned herein with applicable<br>
small alterations as may become necessary.<br>
Example 1:<br>
Litchi: Litchis (Sahi and China variety) are harvested at matured stage (bright red colour) free<br>
from blemishes from plant. Part of stem about !/2" is kept in fruits to avoid skin damage and<br>
exudation of liquid which could cause de erioration afterwards. Samples are grades as per size,<br>
maturity and colour, washed with chemicals (sodium benzoate, 250 ppm)/chlorine water 5 ppm<br>
(bleaching powder) and surface dried or sulfered for 10 mins. Bu burning sulfer in fume chamber<br>
(500 gm sulfur/ton of fruits). Samples are pre-cooled to 4-50C within one hour to remove Held<br>
heat, then litchis are packed and sealed in 200 gauge LDPE packets keeping about 10% head<br><br>
Space and then sealed. Sealed packets ere kept at 8±2°C and 80-90% RH. Storage life was found<br>
to increase 2-3 times compared to NA samples under same temperature and humidity.<br>
Example 2<br>
Sapota Firm fresh sapotas are washed i I sodium benzoate (250 ppm)/chlorine water (5 -ppm)<br>
for 10 mins. Surface dried and then pre-:ool;ed to 4-50C, followed by packing in LDPE packets<br>
(200 gauge) and sealing. Packets containing fruits are stored at 7±2°C at 85% RH. Storage life<br>
for control samples at the maintained tei iperature and humidity were found one week while<br>
under modified atmosphere system in package, products were found acceptable upto 3 weeks and<br>
with the addition of ethylene scavanger (K.mn04 scaked in asbestos fibres and covered in<br>
cellophene under MAP storage, storage life was found upto 5 weeks.<br>
Advantages of the Invention<br>
Our invention can be used not only for transportation but also for longer storage like (2-3 lime)<br>
of commodities compared to conventional low temperature storage. Beneficiaries for MACTP<br>
process will be cold storage owners, users, transporters, exporters and also exporting companies<br>
using road, rail, ship and air transport. "C rill injury" is nil in our process while in conventional<br>
cold storage (0-2°C) there is occasional cHH injury.<br>
Power consumption is much less in MAC'T system under operating temperature (8±2 C)<br>
compared to cold storage.<br>
The following flow chart briefly explains the various steps of the method of the invention<br><br><br><br>
MACTP OF FRUIT<br>
Figure 1: Storage and transportation of Fruit under MACTP<br>
Precautions<br>
1. Procurement of raw materials<br>
a.	Flowers and fruits and vegetables snould be free from diseases<br>
b.	They should be free from defects/abnormalities/shrinkages etc.<br>
c.	Maturity of the fruits and vegetables should be optimum<br>
Too ripe over mature materials will: spoil at a fast rate.<br>
d.	Chemical treatments may be necessary to remove the surface infection. If the materials<br>
are dipped in chemical solution suff cient time about 30 minutes should be allowed and<br><br>
after treatment the adhering liqu.d should be removed thoroughly in order to prevent<br>
spoilage at later stages.<br>
e.	There should not be any fluctuation of temperature and RH during storage RH should not<br>
go below 70%.<br>
f.	Packing material should be free rom defects like cracks, perforation, improper sealing<br>
etc.<br>
g.	Hygienic condition should be maintained in the processing area,<br>
h. Implant cleaning is necessary with chlorine or other disinfectants<br>
i. Hygiene of the workers handling the product should be properly maintained,<br>
j. Thorough cleaning of the materi al after harvesting from the field is necessary<br>
k. Before keeping the produce in MACTP pre-cooling is necessary to prevent the damage of<br>
the product.<br>
Comparison with Prior Efforts<br>
Comparing the related Indian, US and European Patents on modified atmospheric storage, we<br>
find the following distinguishing features in our innovation.<br>
1.	We worked on tropical fruit, vegetables and flowers. These tropical commodities<br>
having certain specialities have not been covered in other Patents in the manner we<br>
studied<br>
2.	Climacteric behaviour (O2 uptake and CO2 formation) for the commodities were<br>
worked out prior to packaging.<br>
3.	Prompt pre-cooling with 6-24 hours followed by chemical treatment, ethylene<br>
suppressant, if necessary, wese done for better storage life of commodities, storage<br>
life increases 2-3 times compared to conventional cold storage.<br><br>
Permeability values of polymeric films against water vapour, CO2 and O2 for the<br>
commodities are taken into consideration prior to use of a suitable film with particular<br>
thickness. Several films haye been tried and substitutes were assessed for the storage<br>
studies under different temperature and relative humidity.<br>
Instead of low temperature storage chamber insulated rectangular boxes made of<br>
wood and an inner 1'-l .5" layer of insulation on all 4 walls, bottom and top were<br>
fabricated for transportation of commodities. Cooling was done by putting ice in a<br>
separate compartment during transit. Condensate was removed at intervals varying<br>
24-36 hours.<br>
Our system is not a gas pzck system rather respiration of commodities coupled with<br>
temperature and humidity within the suitable polymeric environment controls the<br>
suitable gas composition 2-5% CO2, 2.5% O2) and helps storage of commodities.<br>
We claim our system as MATP (modified Atmospheric Control Temperature<br>
Packing) instead of M.A/CA or MAP mentioned by other inventors.<br>
Transportation trials on road and railways (500-2000 KM) with the commodities<br>
under MACTP in rectangular insulated boxes with ice as coolant in a separate<br>
compartment were founc satisfactory. Cooling can also be done using dry ice in<br>
insulated container).<br><br>
