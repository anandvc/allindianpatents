				<td>METHOD OF RETRANSMISSION TO REDUCE THE OVERHEAD<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a method of<br>
transmitting data in a wireless access system, and more<br>
particularly, to various packet retransmission methods in<br>
the data transmitting method.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In the following description, explained is a method<br>
of transmitting packets in terminals that use IP based<br>
voice over internet protocol (hereinafter abbreviated<br>
'VoIP') in a broadband wireless access system. For this,<br>
VoIP traffic is described as follows. Yet, a packet<br>
transmitting method according to the present invention<br>
needs not to be limited to the VoIP packet transmission<br>
described in the following.<br>
First of all, VoIP traffic is characterized in being<br>
generated in a fixed size with a fixed period in VoIP codec.<br>
And, VoIP communication can be divided into a talk period<br>
(talk-spurt), for which inter-user call is in progress, and<br>
a silence period for which a user is not talking but<br>
listening. In general, the silence period occupies over 50%<br>
in a whole call session.<br>
In order to allocate bandwidths differing in size to<br>
the talk-spurt and the silence period, various kinds of<br>
audio codecs are used. A representative one of the various<br>
kinds of audio codecs is AMR (adaptive multi-rate) scheme<br>
used by GSM (global system for mobile communication) or<br>
UMTS (universal mobile telecommunication system).<br>
Since voice data is not generated for the silence<br>
period, if a bandwidth is allocated to the silence period,<br>
it may bring about a resource waste. To prevent the<br>
resource waste, VoIP supports a silence suppression scheme.<br>
According to the silence suppression scheme, a vocoder for<br>
generating VoIP traffic does not generate traffic for the<br>
silence period and periodically generates a comfort noise<br>
to inform a correspondent user that a call keeps being<br>
maintained. For instance, a vocoder, which uses the. AMR<br>
codec, generates a packet in a fixed size once per 20ms for<br>
a talk-spurt or generates a comfort noise per 160ms.<br>
Meanwhile, for resource allocation to the traffic<br>
having a predetermined period in a fixed size like VoIP in<br>
general, a base station is able to use a method of<br>
allocating a designated region to a specific terminal<br>
fixedly. Namely, a region having an initially determined<br>
size is allocated to a terminal supporting the VoIP service.<br>
And, it is able to inform the terminal of the allocated<br>
region information via an initially transmitted control<br>
channel or message (e.g., UL-MAP or DL-MAP). Thus, the<br>
initially transmitted control channel or message can<br>
contain period information of a region that will be<br>
allocated in the future as well.<br>
Subsequently, for a next period, the base station is<br>
able to keep allocating the corresponding region having<br>
been notified to the terminal via the initially transmitted<br>
control channel or message without a special notice.<br>
Therefore, the terminal transmits VoIP packets via the<br>
allocated region using the region information allocated by<br>
a MAP in the early stage and then transmits VoIP packets<br>
via the same region from a next period using period<br>
information.<br>
Assume that a length of a frame is set to 5ms to<br>
consider a VoIP service. And, assume that a frame period<br>
allocated to a terminal for VoIP packet transmission is set<br>
to 4 frames. In this case, a frame period allocated to a<br>
terminal for VoIP packet transmission may vary according to<br>
characteristics of a service. In particular, in case of a<br>
same VoIP service, the frame period allocated for the VoIP<br>
packet transmission may be used by being defined different<br>
according to the respective consideration factors such as<br>
system characteristics (e.g., a system characteristic<br>
according to a frame length), a VoIP service status (e.g.,<br>
a talk-spurt, a silence period) and the like.<br>
In an initial frame, a base station notifies a<br>
terminal of allocated region information for VoIP packet<br>
transmission via UL-MAP. Thereafter, in a fourth frame or<br>
an eighth frame corresponding to each period, the base<br>
station does not announce region information via the UP-MAP<br>
but allocates a region for the VoIP packet transmission<br>
only.<br>
In this case, a period allocated for the VoIP packet<br>
transmission corresponds to four frames (i.e., 20ms). In<br>
particular, the terminal keeps storing the region<br>
allocation information contained in the UL-MAP received in<br>
the initial frame and is then able to transmit a VoIP<br>
packet via a corresponding region if there is not reception<br>
of UL-MAP in the fourth or eighth frame. Thus, the base<br>
station is able to allocate the resource for a single VoIP<br>
connection fixedly and constantly due to the VoIP traffic<br>
characteristics.<br>
In the following description, briefly described is a<br>
method of transmitting data between a transmitting side and<br>
a receiving side. In a data transmitting method, if a<br>
transmission failure occurs, a receiving side makes a<br>
retransmission request for corresponding data. In this case,<br>
ARQ (automatic repeat request) scheme is generally used as<br>
a data retransmission scheme.<br>
In the ARQ scheme, an acknowledgement/non-<br>
acknowledgement (hereinafter abbreviated ACK/NACK) signal<br>
indicating whether a receiving side correctly receives data<br>
is notified to a transmitting side. The receiving side then<br>
retransmits the data for the corresponding signal in case<br>
of receiving the NACK signal. The ARQ scheme can be<br>
categorized into SAW (stop-and-wait) ARQ, GBN (go-back-N)<br>
ARQ and SR (selective-repeat) ARQ.<br>
In the SAQ ARQ scheme, a transmitting side waits<br>
after data transmission until receiving ACK or NACK signal.<br>
If the ACK signal is received, the transmitting side newly<br>
transmits next data. If the NACK signal is received, the<br>
transmitting side retransmits the previous data. Namely,<br>
the SAW ARQ scheme is a scheme for transmitting a single<br>
frame at a time only. If it is confirmed that a<br>
corresponding frame is successfully delivered, a next frame<br>
is transmitted.<br>
The GBN ARQ scheme is a scheme for continuously<br>
transmitting data regardless of a response message. In case<br>
that a receiving side fails to receive data of a specific<br>
frame in the course of receiving data, the receiving side<br>
is unable to transmit an ACK signal for the specific frame<br>
to a transmitting side. Since the transmitting side is<br>
unable to receive the ACK signal for the specific frame,<br>
the transmitting side retransmits data from the data of the<br>
specific frame.<br>
In the SR ARQ scheme, while data keeps being<br>
transmitted, data corresponding to a received NACK signal<br>
is retransmitted only. If a receiving side fails to receive<br>
data of a specific frame, the receiving side transmits a<br>
NACK signal to a transmitting side. The transmitting side<br>
having received the NACK signal then retransmits the data<br>
of the frame indicated by the NACK signal to the receiving<br>
side to transmit the whole data. Since the SR ARQ scheme<br>
gives a sequence to each frame and manages it, the<br>
implementation of the SR ARQ scheme may becomes complicated<br>
relatively.<br>
In the scheme for transmitting data in packet format,<br>
as a higher data rate becomes necessary, a coding rate or a<br>
modulation scheme, which has a suitable level to prevent<br>
error generated in high-speed transmission environment, is<br>
applied to a communication system. And, ARQ scheme suitable<br>
for the high-speed transmission environment, i.e., Hybrid<br>
ARQ (hereinafter abbreviated HARQ) has been proposed.<br>
In the ARQ scheme, if error is generated, the<br>
corresponding information is discarded. Yet, in the HARQ<br>
scheme, a receiving side stores erroneous information in s<br>
buffer. The receiving side combines the stored information<br>
with retransmitted information and then applies FEC<br>
(forward error correction) thereto. Namely, the HARQ scheme<br>
may be regarded as the scheme generated from combining the<br>
ARQ scheme with the FEC. The HARQ can be mainly categorized<br>
into the following four types.<br>
In a first type HARQ scheme, a receiving side always<br>
checks an error detection code in data and then primarily<br>
applies FEC thereto. If error still remains in a packet,<br>
the receiving side makes a request for a retransmission to<br>
a transmitting side. The receiving side discards an<br>
erroneous packet. The transmitting side then retransmits a<br>
packet by applying the same FEC code of the discarded<br>
packet to the retransmitted packet.<br>
Second type HARQ scheme is called IR (incremental<br>
redundancy) ARQ scheme. In the second type HARQ scheme, a<br>
receiving side stores a first transmitted packet in a<br>
buffer instead of discarding it and then combines it with<br>
retransmitted redundancy bits. In case of retransmission, a<br>
transmitting side retransmits parity bits only except data<br>
bits. Each time the parity bits are retransmitted by the<br>
transmitting side, different ones are used.<br>
A third type HARQ scheme corresponds to a special<br>
case of the second type HARQ scheme. Each packet is self-<br>
decodable. In case that a transmitting side performs<br>
retransmission, the transmitting side configures a packet<br>
containing an erroneous part and data together and then<br>
retransmits the corresponding packet. Although this scheme<br>
enables decoding more accurate than the second type HARQ<br>
scheme, it has efficiency poorer than that of the second<br>
type HARQ scheme in aspect of coding gain.<br>
In a fourth type HARQ scheme, a function of combining<br>
the data initially received and stored by a receiving side<br>
with retransmitted data is added to a function of the first<br>
type HARQ scheme. And, the fourth type HARQ scheme may be<br>
called a matrix combining scheme or a chase combining<br>
scheme. .Moreover, the fourth type HARQ scheme has a gain in<br>
aspect of SINR (signal to interference noise ratio) and<br>
always uses the same parity bits of the retransmitted data.<br>
In case that error is generated in data transmission<br>
or data is lost in the data transmission, the above-<br>
described data transmitting methods enable reconstruction<br>
of original data.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
TECHNICAL PROBLEM<br>
However, in case that transmission/reception of<br>
packets is frequently required like VoIP, it becomes highly-<br>
probable that error is generated from the<br>
transmitted/received packets. Since the number of<br>
transmissions for control messages to allocate new resource<br>
regions and the like is incremented, an overhead is<br>
increased in a MAC layer.<br>
TECHNICAL SOLUTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a<br>
method of transmitting data in a wireless access system<br>
that substantially obviates one or more of the problems due<br>
to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
method of transmitting data, by which data can be<br>
efficiently transmitted.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide<br>
a method of reducing a message overhead in case that packet<br>
retransmissions are frequently necessary.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide<br>
a method of reducing an overhead generated from<br>
retransmitting an erroneous packet for continuously<br>
transmitted VoIP packets and the like.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide<br>
a method of allocating a retransmission region to an least<br>
one mobile station, by which data processing efficiency can<br>
be raised despite that VoIP packet is transmitted to a<br>
plurality of mobile stations.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to<br>
provide a method of allocating a new retransmission region<br>
instead of a previously allocated retransmission region if<br>
error keeps being generated despite that a retransmission<br>
packet is transmitted by allocating a fixed transmission<br>
region, by which efficiency in processing data can be<br>
raised.<br>
Therefore, the present invention relates to a data<br>
transmitting method in a wireless access system and a<br>
packet retransmission method in a wireless access system.<br>
And, in case that frequent packet transmissions/receptions<br>
are necessary, methods for efficiently using resources by<br>
reducing a control overhead are disclosed.<br>
Additional features and advantages of the invention<br>
will be set forth in the description which follows, and in<br>
part will be apparent from the description, or may be<br>
learned by practice of the invention. The objectives and<br>
other advantages of the invention will be realized and<br>
attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the<br>
written description and claims thereof as well as the<br>
appended drawings.<br>
To achieve these and other advantages and in<br>
accordance with the purpose of the present invention, as<br>
embodied and broadly described, a method of retransmitting<br>
a packet in a wireless access system according to the<br>
present invention includes receiving an initial control<br>
message including information required for a packet<br>
retransmission from a base station, transmitting the packet<br>
to be provided with a service from the base station, and if<br>
a NACK (non-acknowledgement) signal is received from the<br>
base station, retransmitting the packet corresponding to<br>
the NACK signal to the base station using the information<br>
required for the packet retransmission and included in the<br>
initial control message.<br>
Preferably, the information required for the packet<br>
retransmission includes information for allocating<br>
different resource allocation regions required for the<br>
packet transmission to at least one or more terminals,<br>
respectively.<br>
Preferably, the information required for the packet<br>
retransmission includes information for configuring at<br>
least one group including terminals having resource<br>
allocation regions equal to each other in size among at<br>
least one or more terminals and for allocating a resource<br>
allocation region required for the packet retransmission to<br>
the at least one group.<br>
Preferably, the information required for the packet<br>
retransmission includes information for setting a<br>
retransmission dedicated channel for the packet<br>
retransmission of at least one terminal and on a specific<br>
region required for the packet retransmission in the<br>
retransmission dedicated channel.<br>
To further achieve these and other advantages and in<br>
accordance with the purpose of the present invention, a<br>
method of retransmitting a packet in a wireless access<br>
system includes the steps of transmitting an initial<br>
control message including information required for a packet<br>
retransmission to at least one terminal, providing a<br>
service to the at least one terminal, and if a NACK (non-<br>
acknowledgement) signal is received from the at least one<br>
terminal, retransmitting the packet corresponding to the<br>
NACK signal to the at least one terminal using the<br>
information required for the packet retransmission and<br>
included in the initial control message.<br>
Preferably, the method further includes the step of<br>
if the base station receives the NACK signal repeatedly<br>
over a prescribed count, transmitting a control signal to<br>
the at least one terminal by updating the information<br>
required for the packet retransmission and then including<br>
the updated information in the control message for the<br>
packet retransmission.<br>
It is to be understood that both the foregoing<br>
general description and the following detailed description<br>
are exemplary and explanatory and are intended to provide<br>
further explanation of the invention as claimed.<br>
ADVANTAGEOUS EFFECTS<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides the<br>
following effects or advantages.<br>
First of all, data communication can be efficiently<br>
performed using the embodiments of the present invention.<br>
Secondly, in case that frequent packet<br>
retransmissions are necessary, a fixed retransmission<br>
region can be allocated to a mobile station via an initial<br>
control message instead of allocating a retransmission<br>
region each time. In particular, if it becomes necessary to<br>
perform a retransmission, it is able to retransmit a packet<br>
via a previously allocated retransmission region without a<br>
separate control message. Therefore, since an additional<br>
and separated control message needs not to be transmitted<br>
in case of packet retransmission, it is able to save radio<br>
resources and reduce an overhead.<br>
Thirdly, in case that frequent packet<br>
transmissions/receptions are necessary like VoIP service,<br>
the present invention is able to reduce an overhead<br>
generated from retransmitting an erroneous packet.<br>
Fourthly, by allocating a retransmission region to<br>
each of at least one or more mobile stations, packets can<br>
be quickly retransmitted via the allocated resource region<br>
in case that the mobile stations perform retransmissions.<br>
Therefore, efficient data processing is enabled.<br>
And, at least one or more mobile stations having the<br>
same attributes are grouped together and a retransmission<br>
region is then allocated per group. Therefore, it is able<br>
to save radio resources.<br>
Moreover, by allocating a dedicated retransmission<br>
channel for a plurality of mobile stations, it is able to<br>
perform more efficient retransmission.<br>
Fifthly, despite that packets are transmitted by<br>
allocating a fixed retransmission region, if errors keep<br>
being generated from the packets, a new retransmission<br>
region is allocated instead of a previously allocated<br>
retransmission region. Therefore, it is able to effectively<br>
cope with the repeatedly generated errors.<br>

embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are<br>
illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
To solve the above-mentioned technical problem, the<br>
present invention provides an efficient data transmitting<br>
method in a wireless access system and an efficient packet<br>
retransmitting method therein. Moreover, the present<br>
invention provides a packet transmitting method to use<br>
resources efficiently by reducing a control overhead of a<br>
MAC layer in case that frequent packet<br>
transmission/receptions are necessary.<br>
The following embodiments are implemented by<br>
combining the elements and features of the present<br>
invention in specific forms, respectively. Each of the<br>
elements or features can be considered selective if there<br>
is no separate explicit description. Each of the elements<br>
or features can be implemented without being combined with<br>
another one. And, an embodiment of the present invention<br>
can be configured by combining the elements and/or features<br>
in part. The order or sequence of the operations mentioned<br>
in the descriptions of the embodiments of the present<br>
invention may be changed. Configurations or features of one<br>
of the embodiments can be partially included in another or<br>
can be replaced by corresponding configurations or features<br>
of another embodiment.<br>
In the description of the drawings, procedures or<br>
steps, which may dilute the gist or substance of the<br>
present invention, are not described. And, procedures or<br>
steps understandable on a level for those skilled in the<br>
art are not described as well.<br>
In this disclosure, embodiments of the present<br>
invention are described centering on data transceiving<br>
relation between a base station and a terminal. In this<br>
case, the base station has the meaning as a terminal node<br>
of a network for performing communication directly with the<br>
terminal. In this disclosure, a specific operation or<br>
action described as performed by a base station can be<br>
performed by an upper node of the base station.<br>
Namely, various operations performed for<br>
communication with a terminal in a network constructed with<br>
a plurality of network nodes and a base station can be<br>
performed by the base station or the network nodes except<br>
the base station. In this case, the 'base station' can be<br>
replaced by such a terminology as a fixed station, a Node B,<br>
an eNode B (eNB), an access point and the like. And,<br>
'mobile station' can be replaced by such a terminology as a<br>
user equipment (DE), a subscriber station (SS), a mobile<br>
subscriber station (MSS), a mobile terminal and the like.<br>
A transmitting end means a node for transmitting data<br>
or a voice service and a receiving end means a node for<br>
receiving data or a voice service. Hence, a terminal and a<br>
base station can become a transmitting end and a receiving<br>
end in uplink, respectively. Likewise, a terminal and a<br>
base station can become a receiving end and a transmitting<br>
end in downlink, respectively.<br>
Meanwhile, a mobile station of the present invention<br>
can include one of a personal digital assistant (PDA), a<br>
cellular phone, a personal communication service (PCS)<br>
phone, a GSM (global system for mobile) phone, a wideband<br>
CDMA (WCDMA) phone, a mobile broadband system (MBS) phone<br>
and the like.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention can be<br>
implemented through diverse means. For instance,<br>
embodiments of the present invention can be implemented<br>

In the following description, VoIP packet<br>
transmission among services, for which frequent packet<br>
retransmissions are required, is taken as an example for<br>
one preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
According to one preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, in case of setting a continuous resource<br>
allocating method for VoIP packet transmission, a base<br>
station enables continuous resource allocation information<br>
for retransmission to be included in an initial control<br>
message and then provides the information to a mobile<br>
station in advance. In uplink, the mobile station is able<br>
to transmit a packet and the like to the base station via<br>
the retransmission region in case that a retransmission<br>
occurs in the base station. In downlink, the base station<br>
is able to transmit a retransmission packet to the mobile<br>
station based on information for retransmission included in<br>
the initial control message provided to the mobile station.<br>
The initial control message may be usable for various<br>
kinds of systems. In particular, the IEEE 802.16 system is<br>
able to use MAP IE (MAP information element) contained in a<br>
MAP message, a MAC management message or the like as the<br>
initial control message.<br>
When a mobile station performs handover in entering a<br>
network of a base station, an initial control message is<br>
usable in the course of setting an interconnection. An<br>
initial control message may be a control message initially<br>
provided when a base station and a mobile station generate<br>
a new service. Namely, an initial control message may be a<br>
control message for allocation to transmit a first VoIP<br>
packet. Moreover, when a service is provided for a talk-<br>
spurt after a silence period, an initial control message is<br>
usable as well. And, it is understood that other control<br>
messages is usable as an initial control message as well as<br>
the above-described message.<br>
As an example for one of various MAC management<br>
messages, there are dynamic service addition messages (e.g.<br>
DSA-REQ or DSA-RSP), channel descriptor messages (e.g. UCD<br>
or DCD), Subscriber Station basic capability messages (e.g.<br>
SBC-REQ or SBC-RSP) or the like. Besides, by non-limiting<br>
various examples for the above-described messages, various<br>
MAC management messages are available according to system<br>
requirements.<br>
In particular, in case of providing a VoIP service to<br>
a mobile station initially, a base station is able to<br>
transmit informations required for retransmission to the<br>
mobile station using such a downlink control message as DL-<br>
MAP IE, UL-MAP IE or the like. When a base station<br>
initially provides a VoIP service to a mobile station, the<br>
base station and the mobile station can negotiate<br>
informations relevant to retransmission.<br>
The information required for retransmission can<br>
contain fixed resource allocation information for<br>
retransmission, MCS (modulation and coding scheme level)<br>
information, a retransmission timing point (e.g.,<br>
information for determining that a retransmission will be<br>
performed in a prescribed frame after receiving a NACK<br>
signal) or the like.<br>
For the information required for retransmission, even<br>
if a mobile station and a base station transceiver packets<br>
via a pre-designated resource allocation region, if a NACK<br>
signal keeps being generated, the base station is able to<br>
allocate a radio resource region for a new retransmission<br>
by transmitting a control message for the new<br>
retransmission to the mobile station after having received<br>
a prescribed number of NACK signals. In this case, the<br>
prescribed number of NACK signals may vary according to a<br>
requirement of a system. In preferred embodiments of the<br>
present invention, a case of consecutively receiving NACK<br>
signals twice is taken as an example to be described in the<br>
following description.<br>
In the following preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention, a region previously allocated for retransmission<br>
is used only if the retransmission is generated only. If<br>
the retransmission is unnecessary, the previously allocated<br>
region is usable to transmit other general messages. This<br>
is to reduce waste of radio resources that may be generated<br>
when a specific region is unnecessarily secured<br>
unnecessarily.<br>
In the process for transceiving VoIP packets between<br>
a base station and a mobile station, if a retransmission is<br>
generated in downlink, the base station transmits a<br>
retransmission packet via a pre-designated resource region.<br>
The mobile station is then able to receive the packet based<br>
on information about a pre-designated region for the<br>
retransmission.<br>
If a retransmission is generated in uplink, the<br>
mobile station transmits a retransmission packet via a<br>
fixed resource region pre-allocated by the base station.<br>
The base station is then able to receive the packet via a<br>
pre-designated region. In particular, if error is generated<br>
from a packet having been retransmitted, a retransmission<br>
is performed using the same method (using a region<br>
allocated in the early time of a specific frame after<br>
completion of receiving NACK) of the initial retransmission.<br>
Alternatively, when the base station performs a<br>
retransmission using region information for the<br>
retransmission, the base station is able to inform the<br>
mobile station of the error generation using a control<br>
message.<br>
In the preferred embodiments of the present invention,<br>
'the error generation from a packet' includes a case that a<br>
mobile station or a base station is unable to receive a<br>
packet lost on a wireless/wire line as well as a case that<br>
error is generated from a transmitted or received packet<br>
itself. And, 'the error generation from a packet' also<br>
includes a case that a mobile station or a base station is<br>
unable to reconstruct an erroneous packet into an original<br>
packet.<br>
In the following description, explained is a<br>
retransmission method used in a MAC layer.<br>
FIG. 1 a flowchart for an embodiment of using HARQ in<br>
transmitting VoIP packets in downlink.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, a method of transmitting VoIP<br>
packets to provide a VoIP service from a base station (BS)<br>
to a mobile station (MS) can be observed. When the base<br>
station BS transmits a DL VoIP packet #1 in downlink, as<br>
error is generated or the DL VoIP packet #1 is lost on<br>
wireless/wire line, if the mobile station is unable to<br>
receive the DL VoIP packet #1 [S101], the mobile station<br>
transmits a NACK signal to the base station [S102].<br>
In this case, in order to retransmit the DL VoIP<br>
packet #1 having been transmitted to the mobile station in<br>
the step S101, the base station transmits a control message<br>
for retransmission by enabling new MCS (modulation and<br>
coding scheme) level information and new resource<br>
allocation region information to be included in the control<br>
message [S103].<br>
The base station, which allocates a new resource<br>
region by transmitting the control message to the mobile<br>
station, retransmits the DL VoIP packet #1 to the mobile<br>
station via the newly allocated resource region [S104]. If<br>
the mobile station normally receives the packet in the step<br>
S104, the mobile station transmits an ACK signal to the<br>
base station [S105].<br>
In order to provide the VoIP service continuously,<br>
the base station transmits a next VoIP packet, i.e., a DL<br>
VoIP packet #2 to the mobile station. Yet, if the DL VoIP<br>
packet #2 is erroneous or lost on wire/wireless line in the<br>
course of reception, the mobile station is unable to<br>
receive the packet normally [S106]. The mobile station<br>
failing to receive the VoIP packet normally transmits a<br>
NACK signal to the base station [S107].<br>
Having received the NACK signal from the mobile<br>
station in the step S107, the base station transmits a<br>
control message for retransmission to the mobile station by<br>
enabling MCS level and resource allocation region<br>
information to be included in the control message [S108].<br>
In the step S108, the mobile station is able to receive<br>
data via a new resource region allocated using the<br>
informations included in the control message for the<br>
retransmission.<br>
The base station then retransmits the DL VoIP packet<br>
#2 corresponding to the NACK signal received in the step<br>
S107 to the mobile station [S109].<br>
PIG. 2 a flowchart for an embodiment of using HARQ in<br>
transmitting VoIP packets in uplink.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, a method of transmitting VoIP<br>
packets to provide a VoIP service to a base station (BS)<br>
from a mobile station (MS) can be observed. When the mobile<br>
station MS transmits a UL VoIP packet #1 in uplink, as<br>
error is generated or the DL VoIP packet #1 is lost on<br>
wireless/wire line, if the base station is unable to<br>
receive the DL VoIP packet #1 [S201] , the base station<br>
transmits a NACK signal to the mobile station [S202].<br>
In this case, in order to receive the erroneous UL<br>
VoIP packet #1 in the step 2101, the base station transmits<br>
a control message for retransmission to the mobile by<br>
enabling a new MCS (modulation and coding scheme) level and<br>
new resource allocation region information to be included<br>
in the control message [S203].<br>
The mobile station has a new resource region<br>
allocated thereto by receiving the control message for the<br>
retransmission and then retransmits the DL VoIP packet #1<br>
to the base station via the newly allocated resource region<br>
[S204] . If the base station normally receives the packet in<br>
the step S204, the base station transmits an ACK signal to<br>
the mobile station [S205].<br>
In order to receive the VoIP service continuously,<br>
the mobile station transmits a next VoIP packet, i.e., a DL<br>
VoIP packet #2 to the base station. Yet, if the DL VoIP<br>
packet #2 is erroneous or lost on wire/wireless line in the<br>
course of reception, the base station may be unable to<br>
receive the packet normally [S206]. The base station<br>
failing to receive the VoIP packet normally transmits a<br>
NACK signal to the mobile station [S207].<br>
Having transmitted the NACK signal to the mobile<br>
station in the step S207, the base station transmits a<br>
control message for retransmission to the mobile station by<br>
enabling MCS level and resource allocation region<br>
information different from the former information provided<br>
in the step S203 to be included in the control message<br>
[S208]. In the step S208, the mobile station is able to<br>
transmit data via a new resource region allocated using the<br>
informations included in the control message for the<br>
retransmission.<br>
The mobile station then retransmits the UL VoIP<br>
packet #2 corresponding to the NACK signal received in the<br>
step S207 to the base station [S209].<br>
As mentioned in the foregoing description of FIG. 1<br>
and FIG. 2, in order for the base or mobile station to<br>
perform the retransmission of the erroneous packet, the<br>
base station repeatedly transmits the control message (e.g.,<br>
MAP IE) including the new resource allocation region<br>
information (or MCS level information) for the<br>
retransmission to the mobile station each time the error is<br>
generated.<br>
FIG. 3 is a diagram for a method of allocating a<br>
fixed radio resource region for retransmission from a base<br>
station to a mobile station according to one embodiment of<br>
the present invention.<br>
In FIG. 3, a horizontal axis indicates a time unit as<br>
a frame unit and a vertical axis indicates a frequency unit.<br>
'P1' in Frame 1 or Frame 5 indicates a region allocated to<br>
a first mobile station by a base station for a continuous<br>
VoIP packet transmission/reception to/from the first mobile<br>
station in downlink/uplink. 'P2' indicates a radio resource<br>
region allocated to a second mobile station, 'P3' indicates<br>
a radio resource region allocated to a third mobile station,<br>
and 'P4' indicates a radio resource region allocated to a<br>
fourth mobile station.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, the base station allocates a<br>
region for retransmission to each mobile station having a<br>
VoIP connection by identifying the corresponding mobile<br>
station one by one. In downlink, the base station transmits<br>
a VoIP packet to the mobile station via the allocated<br>
region. In uplink, the mobile station transmits a VoIP<br>
packet to the base station via the allocated region. In<br>
particular, the first mobile station transmits VoIP packets<br>
with the base station via P1. And, the rest of the mobile<br>
stations transmit/receive VoIP packets to/from the base<br>
station via the allocated regions, respectively.<br>
In Frame 3 or Frame 7, 'R1' indicates a region<br>
allocated for retransmission to correspond to P1, 'R2'<br>
indicates a region allocated for retransmission to<br>
correspond to P2, 'R3' indicates a region allocated for<br>
retransmission to correspond to P3, and 'R4' indicates a<br>
region allocated for retransmission to correspond to P4.<br>
The base station enables informations for retransmission to<br>
be included in an initial control message and is then able<br>
to transmit the control message to each of the mobile<br>
stations. Hence, if a retransmission takes place, the base<br>
station and the mobile stations can transmit the<br>
retransmitted packets with each other via the preset<br>
retransmission regions. In particular, in case that error<br>
is generated from the VoIP packet transmitted between the<br>
base station and each of the mobile stations via<br>
P1/P2/P3/P4, the base station and each of the mobile<br>
stations can transmit the retransmitted packet via the pre-<br>
allocated radio resource region R1/R2/R3/R4.<br>
Even if error is not generated in the course of<br>
transmitting packets between one of the first to fourth<br>
mobile stations and the base station, keeping the pre-<br>
allocated region for retransmission will be a waste of<br>
radio resources. Hence, if the retransmission is<br>
unnecessary, the pre-allocated region for the<br>
retransmission can be used to transmit a different packet<br>
of each of the mobile stations or packet of the base<br>
station. This agreement can be established through mutual<br>
negotiation in case that the base station and the mobile<br>
station are interconnected to each other or an initial<br>
service is provided.<br>
FIG. 4 is a diagram for a method of allocating a<br>
radio resource region for retransmission from a base<br>
station to a mobile station according to another embodiment<br>
of the present invention.<br>
In FIG. 4, a horizontal axis indicates a time unit as<br>
a frame unit and a vertical axis indicates a frequency unit.<br>
'P1' in Frame 1 or Frame 5 indicates a region allocated to<br>
a first mobile station by a base station for a continuous<br>
VoIP packet transmission/reception to/from the first mobile<br>
station in downlink/up link. 'P2' indicates a radio<br>
resource region allocated to a second mobile station by the<br>
base station, 'P3' indicates a radio resource region<br>
allocated to a third mobile station by the base station,<br>
and 'P4' indicates a radio resource region allocated to a<br>
fourth mobile station by the base station.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, in downlink, the base station<br>
transmits a VoIP packet to the mobile station via the<br>
allocated region. In uplink, the mobile station transmits a<br>
VoIP packet to the base station via the allocated region.<br>
In particular, the first mobile station transmits VoIP<br>
packets with the base station via P1. And, the rest of the<br>
mobile stations transmit/receive VoIP packets to/from the<br>
base station via the allocated regions, respectively.<br>
In FIG. 4, assume that a region allocated to a mobile<br>
station to transmit VoIP packets is equal to the region<br>
shown in FIG. 3. Yet, FIG. 4 differs from FIG. 3 in<br>
allocating a retransmission region. The base station puts<br>
mobile stations having the same attribute (e.g., the same<br>
size of the resource region allocated for packet<br>
transmission) into one group and is then able to allocate a<br>
radio resource for retransmission. In particular, in case<br>
that the base station configures a retransmission region,<br>
mobile stations having the same resource allocation region<br>
size in the same frame into at least one or more groups and<br>
is then able to allocate a resource allocation region for<br>
retransmission to each of the groups.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, since a size of a radio resource<br>
region allocated to the first mobile station is equal to a<br>
size of a radio resource region allocated to the second<br>
mobile station, the first and second mobile stations can be<br>
put into one group. Since a size of a radio resource region<br>
allocated to the third mobile station is equal to a size of<br>
a radio resource region allocated to the fourth mobile<br>
station, the third and fourth mobile stations can be put<br>
into another group.<br>
Hence, in Frame 3 or Frame 7, 'R1 (retransmission<br>
region allocated for retransmissions of regions P1 and P2)'<br>
is allocated as a retransmission region of the first and<br>
second mobile stations. And, 'R2 (retransmission region<br>
allocated for retransmissions of regions P3 and P4)' is<br>
allocated as a retransmission region of the third and<br>
fourth mobile stations.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, when<br>
retransmission take place in all of the mobile stations<br>
having the same retransmission region allocated thereto, if<br>
VoIP packets are transmitted using the same retransmission<br>
regions, collisions may cause a problem that retransmission<br>
packets are unable to be normally retransmitted.<br>
To solve this problem, one mobile station keeps using<br>
a previously allocated retransmission. Yet, it is necessary<br>
to allocate a region different from the previously<br>
allocated region to the other mobile station for<br>
retransmission.<br>
For instance, assume that the first and second mobile<br>
stations transmit VoIP packets to the base station in<br>
uplink through P1 and P2, respectively. In this case, if<br>
both of the VoIP packets received by the base station<br>
through P1 and P2 are erroneous, the base station transmits<br>
NACK signals to the mobile stations to make requests for<br>
retransmissions of the corresponding packets, respectively.<br>
After the mobile stations have received the NACK signals,<br>
if the mobile stations simultaneously transmit<br>
retransmission packets via a fixed retransmission region R1,<br>
which was previously allocated by the base station through<br>
an initial control message, the retransmission packets may<br>
collide with one another.<br>
Therefore, after a retransmission region is allocated<br>
per group, if errors simultaneously generated from mobile<br>
stations belonging to the same group, the base station<br>
needs to allocate a new retransmission region.<br>
In particular, the first mobile station is made to<br>
retransmit a packet via R1 which is a retransmission region<br>
allocated via an initial control message and the second<br>
mobile station additionally transmits a control message for<br>
retransmission to allocate another resource region, which<br>
is not Rl, for retransmission. Hence, it is ale to control<br>
mutual collision to be avoided.<br>
PIG. 5 is a diagram for a method of allocating a<br>
radio resource region for retransmission from a base<br>
station to a mobile station according to a further<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In FIG. 5, a horizontal axis indicates a time unit as<br>
a frame unit and a vertical axis indicates a frequency unit.<br>
'P1' in Frame 1 or Frame 5 indicates a region allocated to<br>
a first mobile station by a base station for a continuous<br>
VoIP packet transmission to the mobile station in downlink<br>
or 'P1' in Frame 1 or Frame 5 indicates a region allocated<br>
to a first mobile station by a base station for a VoIP<br>
packet reception from the first mobile station in uplink.<br>
'P2' indicates a radio resource region allocated to a<br>
second mobile station by the base station, 'P3' indicates a<br>
radio resource region allocated to a third mobile station<br>
by the base station, and 'P4' indicates a radio resource<br>
region allocated to a fourth mobile station by the base<br>
station.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, in downlink, the base station<br>
transmits a VoIP packet to the mobile station via the<br>
allocated region. In uplink, the mobile station transmits a<br>
VoIP packet to the base station via the allocated region.<br>
In particular, the first mobile station transmits VoIP<br>
packets with the base station via P1. And, the rest of the<br>
mobile stations transmit/receive VoIP packets to/from the<br>
base station via the allocated regions, respectively.<br>
FIG. 5 shows that the base station transmits VoIP<br>
packets with each of the mobile stations by allocating<br>
radio resources to the respective mobile stations, which is<br>
as good as FIG. 3 or FIG. 4.<br>
Yet, FIG. 5 differs from FIG. 3 or FIG. 4 in that<br>
mobile stations perform retransmission using a common<br>
retransmission channel (common ReTx channel) set for the<br>
retransmission instead of allocating retransmission regions<br>
to the mobile stations, respectively. In particular, after<br>
a common retransmission channel has been set as a resource<br>
region available for VoIP packet retransmission, it can be<br>
used in case of retransmission occurrence.<br>
For instance, in case that retransmissions take place<br>
for at least two mobile stations in VoIP downlink, a base<br>
station selects one of the at least two mobile stations and<br>
then enables a packet to be retransmitted to the selected<br>
mobile station using a common retransmission channel. The<br>
base station enables a retransmission process to be<br>
performed by allocating a resource region designated in the<br>
same frame to the unselected mobile stations.<br>
In case that retransmissions take place for at least<br>
two mobile stations in uplink, a base station designates a<br>
single mobile terminal to transmit a retransmission packet<br>
via a common retransmission channel in the same frame only<br>
and then notifies it to the mobile stations. To enable the<br>
unselected mobile stations to perform retransmissions, the<br>
base station can allocate a different region for<br>
retransmission in the same frame.<br>
Referring to PIG. 5, mobile stations transmitting<br>
VoIP packets in the same frame use a common retransmission<br>
channel for retransmission. 'R1' indicates a resource<br>
region for allocating a portion of a common retransmission<br>
channel for retransmissions of P1 and P2. And, 'R2'<br>
indicates a resource region for allocating a portion of a<br>
common retransmission channel for retransmissions of P3 and<br>
P4. Moreover, a region of R2 can include a region of R1.<br>
When retransmissions are generated from at least one<br>
or more mobile stations in uplink, if the at least one or<br>
more mobile stations perform retransmissions via the same<br>
retransmission region, collisions may occur. Hence, if<br>
retransmissions are generated from a plurality of mobile<br>
stations in case of using the same retransmission channel,<br>
a single mobile station performs a retransmission process<br>
(base station to mobile station in case of downlink, mobile<br>
station to base station in case of uplink) using the common<br>
retransmission channel only while the rest of the mobile<br>
stations are made to perform a retransmission process in a<br>
manner of allocating resource regions to the rest of the<br>
mobile stations, respectively.<br>
In case that a retransmission is performed using a<br>
common retransmission channel, an unused region of the<br>
common retransmission channel is available for a<br>
transmission of other packets. For instance, in case that a<br>
retransmission is performed using a region R1, a base<br>
station is able to transmit VoIP packets using a different<br>
region not including a region R1 in a region R2.<br>
The resource allocation for retransmission in FIGs. 3<br>
to 5 can use the same region for initial transmission or a<br>
different region. If the same region for the initial<br>
transmission is used, packets can be just transmitted via a<br>
resource area equal to a previously allocated region<br>
without announcing resource allocation region information<br>
separately.<br>
FIG. 6 is a flowchart for performing a retransmission<br>
using a continuous HARQ setting method in downlink<br>
according to one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, a base station delivers<br>
information for retransmission to a mobile station using a<br>
initial control message [S601].<br>
In the step S601, the initial control message for<br>
retransmission can include a specific DL/DL-MAP IE message,<br>
a DSA-REQ/RSP message, or another MAC management message<br>
according to system requirements. And, the information for<br>
the retransmission can include information on a fixed<br>
resource allocation region and MAC level information or a<br>
transmission timing point (e.g., information indicating<br>
that a retransmission will be performed after duration of<br>
prescribed frames from a timing point of NACK reception).<br>
Preferably, the methods described with reference to<br>
FIGs. 3 to 5 are usable as a method of allocating a fixed<br>
radio resource region for retransmission. According to one<br>
embodiment of the present invention, a case of performing<br>
communication between a single mobile station and a base<br>
station is assumed. In case that communications are<br>
performed between at least one or more mobile stations and<br>
a base station, it is able to allocate a radio resource<br>
region for retransmission using one of the methods<br>
described with reference to FIGs. 3 to 5.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, the base station transmits DL<br>
VoIP packet #1 to the mobile station to provide a VoIP<br>
service thereto. Yet, if error is generated from the DL<br>
VoIP packet #1, the mobile station may not decode the<br>
corresponding packet [S602].<br>
In this case, the mobile station is able to transmit<br>
a NACK signal to the base station to announce that error<br>
has been generated [S603].<br>
Having received the NACK signal, the base station<br>
retransmits the DL VoIP packet #1 to the mobile station via<br>
a region allocated for retransmission without side<br>
information using the information on the resource<br>
allocation region previously negotiated with the mobile<br>
station in the step S601 [S604] . In this case, the mobile<br>
station is able to receive VoIP packet from the base<br>
station via a region allocated for a pre-designated<br>
retransmission.<br>
Having received the VoIP packet normally, the mobile<br>
station transmits an acknowledgement (ACK) signal to the<br>
base station [S605].<br>
To provide the VoIP service continuously, the base<br>
station transmits DL VoIP packet #2 to the mobile station<br>
[S606] .<br>
Yet, in case that the DL VoIP packet #2 transmitted<br>
in the step S606 is erroneous or lost on wire/wireless line,<br>
the mobile station is unable to receive the packet normally.<br>
Therefore, the mobile station transmits a NACK signal to<br>
the base station [S607].<br>
Having received the NACK signal, the base station<br>
retransmits the DL VoIP packet #2 based on information on<br>
fixed resource allocation region, information on MCS level<br>
or retransmission timing point contained in the control<br>
message for the retransmission and the like [S608].<br>
FIG. 7 is a flowchart for performing a retransmission<br>
using a continuous HARQ setting method in uplink according<br>
to another embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to PIG. 7, a base station is able to<br>
deliver information on a resource allocation region for<br>
retransmission and the like using an initial control<br>
message for retransmission [S701] .<br>
In the step S701, the control message for<br>
retransmission can include a specific DL/DL-MAP IE message,<br>
a DSA-REQ/RSP message, or another MAC management message<br>
according to system requirements. And, the information for<br>
the retransmission can include information on a fixed<br>
resource allocation region and MAC level information or a<br>
transmission timing point (e.g., information indicating<br>
that a retransmission will be performed after duration of<br>
prescribed frames from a timing point of NACK reception).<br>
Preferably, the methods described with reference to<br>
FIGs. 3 to 5 are usable as a method of allocating a fixed<br>
radio resource region for retransmission. According to<br>
another embodiment of the present invention, a case of<br>
performing communication between a single mobile station<br>
and a base station is assumed. In case that communications<br>
are performed between at least one or more mobile stations<br>
and a base station, it is able to allocate a radio resource<br>
region for retransmission using one of the methods<br>
described with reference to FIGs. 3 to 5.<br>
Referring to FIG. 7, the mobile station transmits UL<br>
VoIP packet #1 to the base station to provide a VoIP<br>
service thereto. Yet, if error is generated from the UL<br>
VoIP packet #1, the base station may not decode the<br>
corresponding packet [S702].<br>
In this case, the base station is able to transmit a<br>
NACK signal to the mobile station to announce that error<br>
has been generated [S703].<br>
Having received the NACK signal, the mobile station<br>
retransmits the UL VoIP packet #1 to the base station via a<br>
region allocated for retransmission without side<br>
information using the information on the resource<br>
allocation region previously negotiated with the base<br>
station in the step S701 [S704] . In this case, the base<br>
station is able to receive VoIP packet from the mobile<br>
station via a region allocated for a pre-designated<br>
retransmission.<br>
Having received the VoIP packet normally, the base<br>
station transmits an acknowledgement (ACK) signal to the<br>
mobile station [S705].<br>
For the continuous VoIP service, the mobile station<br>
transmits UL VoIP packet #2 to the base station [S706].<br>
Yet, in case that the UL VoIP packet #2 transmitted<br>
in the step S706 is erroneous or lost on wire/wireless line,<br>
the base station is unable to receive the packet normally.<br>
Therefore, the base station transmits a NACK signal to the<br>
mobile station [S707].<br>
Having received the NACK signal, the mobile station<br>
retransmits the DL VoIP packet #2 based on information on<br>
fixed resource allocation region, information on MCS level<br>
or retransmission timing point contained in the control<br>
message for the retransmission and the like [S708].<br>
In FIG. 6 and FIG. 7, in case that the mobile station<br>
and the base station need frequent transmissions and<br>
receptions of packets like the VoIP service, the base<br>
station sets a fixed resource allocation region for<br>
retransmission in advance and is then able to transmit it<br>
to the mobile station via the initial control message.<br>
Therefore, each time a retransmission is necessary, data<br>
packets can be efficiently transmitted by directly<br>
retransmitting the data packet via the pre-designated<br>
region without transmitting the control message for the<br>
retransmission. Since the base station needs not to<br>
transmit the control message to the mobile station in case<br>
of necessity of retransmission, it is able to reduce<br>
overhead of a MAC layer.<br>
FIG. 8 is a flowchart of a packet error processing<br>
method in performing retransmission using a continuous HARQ<br>
setting method in downlink/uplink according to a further<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8, a base station is able to<br>
deliver information on a resource allocation region for<br>
retransmission and the like using an initial control<br>
message for retransmission [S801].<br>
In the step S801, the initial control message for<br>
retransmission can include a specific UL/DL-MAP IE message,<br>
a DSA-REQ/RSP message, or another MAC management message<br>
according to system requirements. And, the information for<br>
the retransmission can include information on a fixed<br>
resource allocation region and MAC level information or a<br>
transmission timing point (e.g., information indicating<br>
that a retransmission will be performed after duration of<br>
prescribed frames from a timing point of NACK reception).<br>
Preferably, the methods described with reference to<br>
FIGs. 3 to 5 are usable as a method of allocating a fixed<br>
radio resource region for retransmission. According to a<br>
further embodiment of the present invention, a case of<br>
performing communication between a single mobile station<br>
and a base station is assumed. In case that communications<br>
are performed between at least one or more mobile stations<br>
and a base station, it is able to allocate a radio resource<br>
region for retransmission using one of the methods<br>
described with reference to FIGs. 3 to 5.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8, in case that VoIP service is<br>
transmitted between the base station and the mobile station,<br>
it may frequently happen that VoIP packet is retransmitted.<br>
In FIG. 8, although the base station transmits a downlink<br>
packet DL VoIP packet #1, error is generated. Therefore,<br>
the base station retransmits the DL VoIP packet #1 to the<br>
mobile station via a pre-designated resource region using<br>
resource allocation region information contained in an<br>
initial control message. Yet, since the retransmitted DL<br>
VoIP packet #1 is erroneous or lost on wire/wireless line,<br>
it may happen that the mobile station is unable to receive<br>
the corresponding packet normally [S802].<br>
If the case of the step S802 takes place, the mobile<br>
terminal transmits a NACK signal to the base station to<br>
announce that the packet was not normally received [S803].<br>
Having received the NACK signal, the base station is<br>
able to retransmit the DL VoIP packet #1 to the mobile<br>
station using the information set for the retransmission in<br>
the initial control message [S804].<br>
While the mobile station and the base station keep<br>
performing the VoIP service, an uplink communication for<br>
transmitting VoIP packet to the base station from the<br>
mobile station can be performed.<br>
In the course of transmitting UL VoIP packet #1 to<br>
the base station from the mobile station, it may happen<br>
that the UL VoIP packet #1 is retransmitted. In this case,<br>
even if the UL VoIP packet #1 is retransmitted, error can<br>
be generated from the retransmitted packet again [S805].<br>
If so, the base station retransmits the NACK signal<br>
to the mobile station to announce that the uplink packet<br>
having been transmitted by the mobile station is erroneous<br>
[S806].<br>
Having received the NACK signal, the mobile station<br>
is able to retransmit the UL VoIP packet #1 to the base<br>
station using the resource allocation region information<br>
for the retransmission included in the initial control<br>
message and the like.<br>
In FIG. 8, shown is the case that error is generated<br>
from VoIP packet retransmitted in uplink or downlink in the<br>
course of providing VoIP service to the mobile station from<br>
the base station. And, FIG. 8 depicts the case that the<br>
retransmission region allocated via the initial control<br>
message keeps being used despite that error keeps being<br>
generated from the retransmitted VoIP packet.<br>
Yet, it may happen that the initially set<br>
retransmission region is not suitable for communication<br>
environment. In this case, by allocating a new<br>
retransmission region instead of a channel having error<br>
kept being generated therefrom, packets are transmitted via<br>
the new retransmission region to achieve a better gain in<br>
aspect of data processing efficiency.<br>
FIG. 9 is a flowchart of a packet error processing<br>
method in case of detecting error repeatedly in performing<br>
retransmission using a continuous HARQ setting method in<br>
downlink/uplink according to a further embodiment of the<br>
present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 9, a base station is able to inform<br>
a mobile station of retransmission region information in<br>
advance in a manner of continuous resource allocation<br>
information for retransmission is made to be included in an<br>
initial control message [S901].<br>
In the step S901, the information required for the<br>
retransmission may include information on a fixed resource<br>
allocation region and MAC level information or a<br>
transmission timing point (e.g., information indicating<br>
that a retransmission will be performed after duration of<br>
prescribed frames from a timing point of NACK signal<br>
reception).<br>
To prepare for a case that error keeps being<br>
generated despite performing a retransmission via a new<br>
transmission region, the base station is able to negotiate<br>
a prescribed count for receiving a NACK signal repeatedly<br>
with the mobile station. If the base or mobile station<br>
receives the NACK signal over the prescribed count, the<br>
base station is able to transmit a control message for<br>
allocating a new retransmission region again.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the present<br>
invention, assume that the prescribed count for receiving<br>
the NACK signal is set to 2. Of course, the prescribed<br>
count for receiving the NACK signal may vary according to<br>
system requirements or communication environment.<br>
Preferably, the methods described with reference to<br>
FIGs. 3 to 5 are usable as a method of allocating a fixed<br>
radio resource region for retransmission. According to a<br>
further embodiment of the present invention, a case of<br>
performing communication between a single mobile station<br>
and a base station is assumed. In case that communications<br>
are performed between at least one or more mobile stations<br>
and a base station, it is able to allocate a radio resource<br>
region for retransmission using one of the methods<br>
described with reference to FIGs. 3 to 5.<br>
Referring to FIG. 9, in downlink transmission, the<br>
base station transmits DL VoIP packet #1 to the mobile<br>
station. Yet, it may happen that the DL VoIP packet #1 is<br>
erroneous or lost on wire/wireless line [S902].<br>
If the mobile station is unable to normally know the<br>
information included in the packet as the received packet<br>
is erroneous or if the mobile station is unable to receive<br>
the packet that is lost, the mobile station transmits a<br>
NACK signal to the base station to announce the reception<br>
failure [S903].<br>
Having received the NACK signal, the base station is<br>
able to retransmit the DL VoIP packet #1 via a preset<br>
retransmission region using the resource allocation region<br>
information included in the initial control message [S904].<br>
Yet, if the retransmitted VoIP packet is erroneous as well,<br>
the mobile station transmits a NACK signal to the base<br>
station again [S905].<br>
As the count of the NACK signal received by the base<br>
station from the mobile station becomes 2, the count<br>
negotiated with the mobile station in the initial service<br>
setting is met. Therefore, the base station transmits a<br>
control message for retransmission to the mobile station to<br>
allocate a new retransmission region again [S906]. In the<br>
control message to allocate the retransmission region in<br>
the step S906, information on a new retransmission region,<br>
MCS level information or information or a transmission<br>
timing point can be included.<br>
The base station allocates a new retransmission<br>
region to the mobile station via the control message in the<br>
step S906 and is then able to retransmit the DL VoIP packet<br>
#1 again [S907]. In case of receiving the DL VoIP packet #1<br>
normally, the mobile station transmits an ACK signal to the<br>
base station to announce the transmission success.<br>
In the course of transmitting or receiving the VoIP<br>
service, it may happen that a data packet is transmitted in<br>
uplink. In particular, while the mobile station transmits<br>
VoIP packet to the base station, it may happen that UP VoIP<br>
packet #1 is retransmitted to the base station [S908].<br>
Yet, if the VoIP packet retransmitted in the step<br>
S908 becomes erroneous, the base station transmits NACK<br>
signal to the mobile station to announce that the<br>
corresponding packet is erroneous [S909].<br>
Having received the NACK signal in the step S909, the<br>
mobile station receives the NACK signal consecutively twice.<br>
Hence, the NACK signal reception count negotiated with the<br>
base station in the initial service configuration is met.<br>
In this case, since the base station already knows the fact<br>
that errors are at least twice generated from the received<br>
VoIP packet received from the mobile terminal, the mobile<br>
station is able to transmit a control message to allocate a<br>
new retransmission region to the mobile station despite an<br>
absence of a request made by the mobile station [S910].<br>
Having allocated the new retransmission region<br>
thereto in the step S190, the mobile station is able to<br>
retransmit UL VoIP packet #1 to the base station [S911].<br>
According to a further embodiment of the present<br>
invention, error occurs repeatedly even if the<br>
retransmission is performed by allocating the<br>
retransmission region in uplink or downlink. In this case,<br>
it is able to raise data processing efficiency in a manner<br>
of allocating a new retransmission region again and then<br>
transmitting VoIP packet via another channel instead of the<br>
channel on which the error keeps being generated.<br>
FIG. 10 is a flowchart for a method of performing<br>
retransmission in the course of transceiving VoIP service<br>
between a base station and at least one mobile station in<br>
uplink according to a further embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 10, a base station is able to<br>
provide VoIP service to at least one or more mobile<br>
stations existing within its service area. In this case,<br>
the base station is able to deliver information on resource<br>
allocation region for packet retransmission and the like to<br>
a first mobile station MSI and a second mobile station MS2<br>
among a plurality of the mobile stations using an initial<br>
control message for retransmission [S1001, S1002].<br>
In the step S1001 or S1002, the initial control<br>
message for retransmission can include a specific UL/DL-MAP<br>
IE message, a DSA-REQ/RSP message, or another MAC<br>
management message according to system requirements. And,<br>
the information for the retransmission can include<br>
information on a fixed resource allocation region and MAC<br>
level information or a transmission timing point (e.g.,<br>
information indicating that a retransmission will be<br>
performed after duration of prescribed frames from a timing<br>
point of NACK reception). Preferably, the methods described<br>
with reference to FIG. 4 and FIG. 5 are usable as a method<br>
of allocating a fixed radio resource region for<br>
retransmission.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the base station puts the first mobile station<br>
MS1 and the second mobile station MS2, which have the same<br>
attribute (e.g., equal size in an allocated resource<br>
region), into a group. The base station then allocates a<br>
same retransmission region to both of the first mobile<br>
station MS1 and the second mobile station MS2 or designates<br>
a common retransmission channel for VoIP packet<br>
retransmission.<br>
The first mobile station MS1 transmits UL VoIP packet<br>
#1 to the base station for the VoIP packet transmission<br>
[S1003]. And, the second mobile station MS2 transmits UL<br>
VoIP packet #2 to the base station for the VoIP packet<br>
transmission [S1004] . Yet, if the UL VoIP packet #1 or the<br>
DL VoIP packet #2 is erroneous, it may happen that the base<br>
station is unable to reconstruct the corresponding packet.<br>
The base station informs the first mobile station MS1<br>
or the second mobile station MS2 that the corresponding<br>
uplink packet is erroneous [S1005, S1006].<br>
In case that both of the first mobile station MS1 or<br>
the second mobile station MS2 perform retransmissions, as<br>
the same retransmission region is allocated to both of the<br>
first mobile station MS1 or the second mobile station MS2,<br>
it is unable to simultaneously transmit packets via the<br>
same region. In this case, the base station enables the<br>
first mobile station MS1 to retransmit the corresponding<br>
packet via the previously allocated retransmission region<br>
and should control the second mobile station MS2 to<br>
retransmit the corresponding packet via another<br>
retransmission region. Therefore, the base station is able<br>
to allocate a new retransmission region to the second<br>
mobile station MS2 via a control message for retransmission<br>
[S1007].<br>
The first mobile station MS1 retransmits the UL VoIP<br>
packet #1 via the retransmission region previously<br>
allocated in the step S1001 [S1008]. And, the second mobile<br>
station MS2 retransmits the DL VoIP packet #2 via the<br>
retransmission region re-allocated in the step S1007<br>
[S1009] . Thus, it is able to prevent the retransmitted<br>
packets from colliding with each other. Therefore, packet<br>
retransmissions can be more efficiently performed by<br>
avoiding collisions between the retransmitted packets.<br>
