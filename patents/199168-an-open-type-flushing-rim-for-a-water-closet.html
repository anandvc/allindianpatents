This lavatory flushing system consists of a bowl and flush means, with specialty shaped rim which allows the pressurized water into the annular cavity in tlie bowl and a trough portion for directing the water flow along the lengathof the bowl. The down stream, portion allows the water to fall downwards and reach at the extreme end at the bowl. Thus this improved design of flushing device with open rim type is light in weight, easier to manufacture and provide a proper channel of flushing.</td>

				<td>It is an object of the present invention to devise a lavatory flushing system of the afore described kind, more specifically the flushing channel, wliich ensure proper and even flushing even in the case of Indian type toilet pot with additional length of bowl.<br>
This object is achieved by a separate channel provided along the gap in the open rim closet. The object is to use the open rim type channel but achieve the results of box rim type channel.<br><br>
PRIOR ART<br>
A lavatory flushdevice majnly comprises a being/bowl provided with a flushing rim which may be box type or open type.<br>
A box type rim as illustrated in figure 5 and figure 6 is currently well known. This includes a bowl having a side wail with foot treads affixed thereto, said foot treads comitrising interconnected uppei- and lower portions definii^ there is between an annular space, the periphery of said lower space having apertures to allow escape there from of water introduced into said space during fiushing of the toilet.<br>
The second known art is tlie open flush rim, as illustrated in fig 1 and fig 2, the rim being of the type havu:^ a fixed top wall and fixed at least partially downwardly directed aidewalls with one sidewall having a flushing water inlet- During the flushing cycle the flushing water is allowed with pressure, so as to carry certain amount of water along the peripheral length of the bowl and certaiu amount of water to fkH downwardly aloi^ with the wall of the bowl by the open rim.<br><br>
In the box type Channel, the water from the inlet is carried into the bowl through the closed water channels provided along the circumferences<br><br>
of the banl.   The water channels provided along the circumference are<br><br><br>
Advantages;<br><br><br>
towards the end of the unit is weak, Also to usual casting problem, the flushing along the length is not uniform, as the Ihishing channel cannot be kept uniform along the length. So any casting imperfection, along the open end of the channel, results in uneven Hushii^ along the ler^th,<br>
A open rim chaimel device currently knorwn is iUustrate<l iii figure and></l>
Tlie jJToposed invention is illustrated in fig.3 and fig.4. As in a open type rim, a small continuous gap is provided between tlie rim and the bowL In addition and as em. improvement, a separation has been provided along the continuing gap to form a trough.<br>
The flushing stream starting at the commencement of the opening is therefture primarify giiided throvigh the rim flushing channel party through the trough and partly tiirough the open end of the nm. The trough accomplishes to accelerate and increase the peripheral fiow of water.<br>
Any imperfect maiding in the open end of the rim, which results in uneven and quick flushing at a shorter distance is taken care of the inventive arrangement of the trough. As a result, of the equal water<br><br>
flushing, the water is carried until the other end of the unit for the flushing process in that end.<br>
The channel consists of first wall A which is rig^ straight and vertical The lower end of the wall A is left free. Hie U]i])er cud of A is connected to B, which is rigid, sti-ai^t and horizontal. Togetlier they from X' shape. To the other end of B, is connected the thfrd wall 'C. *C* is made up of a specific shaped piece. 'C is a curved wall witii the portion D forming the channel. Tlie novelty of the invention is tlie special shape and conflguration of unit 'C* of the rim.<br>
The rim e
Thus with this we axe ahlÂ» to achieve an effective lavatory flushing even at the other extreme end of the bowl unit.<br>
This is accomplished with the ceronm; toilets in liie flushing rim, by forming a special shaped flushix^ rim as illustrated in fig. 3 and fig. 4. The pressurized water in the trough portion of the rim run along the peripheral length of the bowl, where as the balance of the water in the channel simply run vertically down tlie wall of the toilet.<br><br>
This invention is an improvement in the flushing rim poi'tion, wherein the trough portion causes the flushing water to run along the entire length of the bowl and reach the extreme end of the bowl. The trough also contribute to even flushing action of the water in the bowl.<br>
In a ceramic toilet Orisaa type including a bowl having length 580mm. is pi-esci*ibed by Indian Standards with an open rim channel comprising a trough portion and fliish portion allows the flow of water along the peripheral length of tlie bowl, the flush portion allows escape of water introduced, downwards along the wall of the toilet bowl.<br>
The trough portion and the flush portion, are so constructed so as to able to retain tlie even distribution of the water in the flush riiu of the toilet bowl.<br>
The Invention enhances the rate of water flow along the let^th of the bowl. The trou^ permits tiie ti-ansfer of substantially amount of the water along the length to the other extreme end of the bowl. The trough portion and hollow portion together form a hoUow flushing rim through which water m.ay be directed against wall of the said toil^ bowl in a continuous, undulating sheet for washing substantially the entire wall of said toilet bowl disposed there beneath, along the entire length of the bowl and the trough is so shaped, that allows said flushing rim to be completely drained of said flushing water thereby elizuiziadzig sanitation<br><br>
problems caused by the retention of flasinging watei- within said Hushing<br>

1. An. open type flushing rim. for a water closet having a bowl and flush means said rim comprising an annular cavity in a horizontal orientation with said bowl, and having a trough portion and down-streain portion, said flush  means supplying pressurized water to the annular cavity, said trough portion directing the total water along the periphei'al length of the bowl, the said down-stream poiiion directing water partially along the length of the bowl and also allowing the water to &amp;11 downwards along the wall of the bowl;<br><br></td>
