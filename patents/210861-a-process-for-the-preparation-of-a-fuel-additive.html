				<td>This invention relates to a process for the preparation of a fuel additive to be used with petroleum fuel like petrol and diesel in the vehicles.<br>
The use of petroleum fuel is well established in the vehicles in the prior art. However, there are certain disadvantages associated with the use of the petroleum fuel in the vehicles as well as in the internal combustion engines. One of the main disadvantage is that the quantity of the petroleum fuel is decreasing day by day and after some time there will be no fuel available for use.<br>
Another disadvantage is that the use of petroleum fuel produces pollution to the environment and thus the use of gases like CNG have now been introduced by the Government.<br>
Yet another disadvantage is that the conventional petroleum fuel decreases the efficiency of the engine and the mileage of the vehicle is low.<br>
Still another disadvantage is that the conventional petroleum fuel decreases life of the engine and the wear and tear is more.<br>
Therefore, the main object of this invention is to propose a fuel additive, which is added in the petroleum fuel in a very less quantity and thus increases the efficiency of the fuel and also increases the mileage of the vehicle.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to propose a fuel additive, which reduces the pollution created by the vehicle substantially.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to propose a fuel additive which when used with the conventional petroleum fuel it increases the life of the engine also it helps in reconditioning the engine of the vehicle.<br>
According   to   this   invention   there   is   provided   a   process   for   the preparation of fuel additive for use with the petroleum fuel comprising:<br>
a)	preparing a solution of 0.65-1 % hydro carbon monomers as herein<br>
described in water,<br>
b)	heating said solution at a temperature of 60-80° C,<br>
c)	adding 0.21%-0.43% Salicylic acid in the above hot solution,<br>
d)	cooling said solution to room temperature and adjusting the pH to<br>
normal/neutral,<br>
e)	adding 0.43-0.65% micro particles of zeolite into said solution,<br>
f)	dissolving 0.02-0.45 grams chromium salt into 5 gram non polar ionic<br>
solvent,<br>
g)	adding the same into the above solution and then<br>
h) stirring said solution for a period of 35-37 hours to get said fuel additive.<br>
The process of the present invention according to a preferred embodiment is herein described and illustrated in the following example.<br>
A solution of hydro carbon monomers in water is prepared by dissolving 0.65-1% by weight in water the solution of the hydro carbon monomers is heated at a temperature of 60-80°C and 0.21-0.43% by weight of Sailycyllic acid is added into the above solution. The solution is then cooled to room temperature and the pH is adjusted to neutral/normal. 0.43-0.65% by weight of the micro particles obtained from the zeolite are added into said cold solution. 0.02-0.4% by weight of chromium salt is dissolved in 5 gram non polar ionic solvent and the solution is added into the above mentioned cold solution. The solution is then subjected to the step of stirring for a period of 35-37 hours so as to get the fuel additive.<br>
The hydro carbon monomers used in the above process are for example carbon hydrogen and oxygen. The micro particles obtained from the zeolite containing the micro particles of sodium aluminum and chromium. The chromium salt used is for example chromic acid or potassium chromate. The non-polar ionic solvents are hydrogen perioxide, sodium oxide or potassium hydroxide.<br>
The micro particles of sodium aluminum and chromium are obtained from the zeolite by dissolving the zeolite in a solvent for example sodium hydroxide (NaoH) and filtering the same to obtain the residue in the form of micro particles.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
7 grams hydrocarbon monomers was dissolved in 1 litre water. The solution so obtained was heated at a temperature of 60°C. 3.5 ml Sailycyllic acid was added into the above hot solution. The hot solution was then cooled at room temperature and the pH was adjusted to the normal/neutral. 4.5 grams micro particles of the zeolite were added into the above solution. 0.35 gram chronic acid was dissolved into 5 gram hydrogen perioxide and the solution so obtain was added into the above solution. The solution was then subjected to the step of stirring for a period of 37 hours in order to get the fuel additive. It has been found that the small amount of this fuel when added with the petroleum fuel like petrol and diesel it increases the mileage of the vehicle in the range of 2-5 km/litre. Thus it is found that the petroleum fuel can be saved and also the efficiency of the engine is increased.<br><br><br><br><br>
I CLAIM<br>
1.	A  process   for  the  preparation   of fuel  additive   for  use   with   the<br>
petroleum fuel comprising<br>

normal / neutral,<br>
e)	adding 0.43-0.65% micro particles of zeolite into said solution,<br>
f)	dissolving 0.02-0.45 grams chromium salt into 5 gram non polar ionic<br>
solvent,<br>
g)	adding the same into the above solution and then<br>
h) stirring said solution for a period of 35-37 hours to get said fuel additive.<br>
2.	A process as claimed in claim 1 wherein said micro particles of zeolite<br>
are   obtained   by  dissolving  the   zeolite   in   a   solvent   like   sodium<br>
hydroxide and filtering the same to obtain the residue containing the<br>
micro particles of sodium aluminum and/or chromium.<br>
3.	A process as claimed in claim 1 wherein said chromium salt are for<br>
example chromic acid or potassium chromate.<br>
4.	A process as claimed in claim 1 and 4 wherein said non polar ionic<br>
solvent   are   for   example   hydrogen   perioxide,   sodium   oxide   or<br>
potassium hydroxide.<br>
5.	A   process   for  the   preparation  of fuel  additive   for  use   with   the<br>
petroleum fuel substantially as herein described and illustrated.<br></td>
