				<td>This invention relates to a device for teaching the lymph massage for treatment of lymphedema, a swelling due to blockage of lymphatics. It is a real life size human like model comprising a frame with multiple mobile joints, the said frame covered with soft material to impart the contour and softness of human body. The model is kept on bed in a supine position. Lymph massage is performed on this model for purpose of training. The usual practice of learning lymph massage by repeated attempts on a patient / volunteer causes discomfort to him! her. The present device eliminates this element of discomfort caused to the patient / volunteer by replacing him her.</td>

				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention is intended to fabricate a device for teaching of lymph massage.<br>
Lymphatics are a system of tubes present inside the human body. They carry a type of body fluid called lymph. Due to various causes the lymphatics may get obstructed causing accumulation of lymph that manifests as swelling of limbs and other parts of the body. This swelling is known as lymphedema. Advanced stage of lymphedematous swelling is called elephantiasis. Filariasis is the main cause of lymphedema in our country, In India, there are about ten wiUion patients suffering from filarial lymphedema.<br>
The treatment of lymphedema includes drugs, physical theraphy, surgery and psychological support. Lymphedema is not curable. It has to be managed lifelong. Physical therapy plays an important role in reducing the swelling and is necessary lifelong, to prevent increase in the swelling. Lymph massage (manual lymph drainage) is one of the effective modalities of physical therapy. This is administered every day.<br>
The massage should, ideally, be administered by a trained physical therapist. In rural areas a physical therapist is usually not available. In such cases relative of the patient may be trained to perform this.<br><br>
The massage is performed either on a patient or on a volunteer, who acts as a model. He / she has to he down in supine position. His or her abdomen, chest and limbs are massaged by the therapist with his hands. During the massage of a limb, its joints need to be folded and moved. Each sitting of the massage takes about 15 minutes, For effective training the trainer /teacher has to demonstrate it a number of times and the trainee / learner also has to practise it several tunes. This repeated massage for training purpose causes discomfort to the patient / volunteer and on many occasions the patient refuses to co-operate.<br>
The objective of this invention is to develop a model for teaching lymph massage. The present device is a life size human like model with one leg made fatter to simulate a limb affected with lymphedematous swelling (LS); the said model consisting of a frame (FR) made of solid aluminium rods (SR) simulating the skeleton of human body; the said rods being straight ones for the neck and limbs; the said rods having a piece (TP) for the trunk with T shape at the upper end and anchor shape m the lower end; the said rods connected to one another by chain joints (CJ) consistmg of stainless steel rings (CR) passed through holes at the ends of the aluminium rods; the said frame kept inside a fur cloth cover (CL) of human shape simulating the skin; the space between the frame and the cloth cover filled with synthetic cotton (SC) simulating human flesh.<br>
Human models for resuscitation and endotracheal intubation are available<br><br>
commercially. To the best of our knowledge a model for training in lymph massage is not available.<br>
The invention will be described with reference to figure 1-4 in the accompanying three drawing sheets.<br>
Figure 1 is the life size human like model. (FR) is the aluminium firame; (SR) is a piece of straight aluminium rod in the &amp;ame; (TP) is the trunk piece of rod; (CJ) is a chain joint; (CL) is the cloth cover; (SC) is the synthetic cotton stuffing; (CR) is a ring.<br>
Figure 2 shows a piece of solid aluminium rod (SR) and the cross section. The cross section is uniform throughout. The length of the solid rod varies according to the body part eg. the rod for the foot is longer than the rod for the hand.<br>
Figure 3 is the solid rod piece of the trunk (TP),<br>
Figure 4 shows the chain joint (CJ). The dimension of the ring is same all over the model.<br>
Figure 5 shows a stainless steel coimecting ring alongwith the cross section.<br>
Method of using the device:<br>
The model is kept supine (flat) on a bed. The tramer /trainee stands on one side of the bed and performs the massage. The massage is done with light pressure on CL (cloth cover simulating skin) with a sliding movement; the fur cloth allows movement without much friction.<br><br>
For lymphedema of the leg the massage is started on the abdomen and then front of thigh while the model is lying flat. Next the hip and knee joints are flexed while the leg rests on the heel. In this position the back of the thigh is massaged. In the same position the leg is massaged also. Next, the model is kept flat and the ankle joint is moved three times in a circular fashion . Now the foot is massaged. Next the toes are moved in circular motion and then massaged. The toes do not have solid rods inside them, they contain the synthetic cotton stuff with cloth cover over it. The chain joints allow all types of movement. The synthetic cotton gives feel of human flesh. The rigidity offered by frame simulates the human bones. One leg being fatter gives impression of lymphedema and makes it easier for the learner to learn the steps.<br>
For lymphedema of the upper limbs the massage starts from the chest and then to the upper limb.<br>
All the steps necessary for the massage of lymphedematous limb are possible on this model.<br>
The advantages of the present device are:<br>
1.	It eliminates the discomfort caused to the patient / volunteer while training on him/her.<br>
2.	The trainee can practise on the model at any time and for any duration of time<br><br>
without any difficulty.<br>
It is to be understood that the present invention is by no means limited to the particular construction herein disclosed and / or shown in the drawing but also comprises any modification or equivalent within the scope of disclosure.<br><br><br>
I claim:<br>
1.	A life size human like model with one leg made fatter to simulate a limb affected with lymphedematous swelling (LS); the said model consisting of a frame (FR) made of solid aluminium rods (SR) simulating the skeleton of human body; the said rods being straight ones for the neck and limbs; the said rods having a piece (TP) for the trunk with T shape at the upper end and anchor shape in the lower end; the said rods connected to one another by chain joints (CJ) consisting of stainless steel rings (CR) passed through holes at the end of the aluminium rods; the said frame kept mside a fur cloth cover (CL) of human shape simulating the skin; the space between the frame and the cloth cover filled with synthetic cotton (SC) simulating human flesh.<br>
2.	A human like model as claimed in claim 1 wherein the frame can be of any metal or nonmetal rigid object.<br>
3.	A human like model as claimed in claim 1 wherein the lymphedematous swelling can appear on any one limb or on several limbs.<br>
4.	A human like model as claimed in claim 1 wherein the joints can be mobile joints of any type.<br>
5.	A human like model as claimed in claim 1 which may be either smaller or bigger than human size.</td>
