				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to an economical and environmentally clean process for the preparation of high quality quaternary ammonium tribromides. More particularly, this invention relates to quaternary ammonium salts of tribromides, having the general formula, QATB where QA is a quaternary ammonium cation selected from the group consisting of tetramethylammonium (TMA), tetraethylammonium (TEA), tetrabutylammonium (TBA), benzyltrimethylammonium (BTMA) and cetyltrimethylammonium (CTMA) and TB (Br3-) is the tribromide anion, obtained by the oxidation of bromide (Br") in an acidic medium by a biomimetic process involving transition metal ion mediated activation of hydrogen peroxide. Background of the invention<br>
Quaternaryammonium tribromides (QATBs) are highly efficient brominating agents. In other words, these reagents are capable of brominating organic substrates without the use of elemental bromine. QATBs act as vital reagents for preparation of bromoorganics which have anti inflammatory, anti viral (e.g., anti HIV), antineoplastic, antibacterial, and antifungal properties and are capable of acting as flame retardants, agrochemicals and other speciality products. The QATBs are regarded as 'solid bromine'.<br>
The QATBs are widely used in the bromination of allyl alcohols, enones, alkenes, alkynes, activated aromatics such as anilines and phenols, polycyclic hydrocarbons such as anthracene and phenanthrene and sensitive substrates such as imidazole. They are also used as bifunctional catalysts in the oxidative bromination of aromatic compounds by aqueous hydrogen bromide/hydrogen peroxide, and diastereoselective bromination of allyl glycosides.<br>
While the main claim of the reagents lies in their ability to act as brominating agents, the QATBs are versatile oxidizing agents as well. The reagents are used for selective oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides, benzyl alcohols to benzaldehydes and benzoic acids, 1,4-benzenediols to 2,5-cyclohexadiene-l,4-diones and oxidation of formic and oxalic acids to carbon dioxide. The oxidation of phosphorus(I) and (III) oxyacids by QATBs leads to the formation of the corresponding phosphorus(III) and (V) oxyacids, respectively.<br><br>
Highlighting the reagents' diverse uses, the QATBs can also be used efficiently for Hofmann degradation of amides, for methoxybromination of styrene and for the one-step synthesis of N-substituted acylureas and carbamates from amides. Moreover, some of the reagents, CTMATB have anti-bacterial properties as well. In an application of topical importance, these reagents have been shown to work as very effective brominating agents in solvent-free bromination of organic substrates.<br>
Quaternary ammonium tribromides, also referred to as organic ammonium tribromides or organic tribromides or organic ammonium perbromides are well known in the art as witnessed for example by the incorporation of these bromides in the Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis, L. A. Paquette (Ed. in chief), 1995, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York and Reagents for Organic Synthesis, L. A. Fieser and M. Fieser, 1967, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York.<br>
Reference is made to J. Chem. Soc, 1923, 123, 654 and J. Org. Chem., 1963, 28, 3256, wherein tetramethylammonium tribromide is prepared from tetramethylammonium bromide and bromine in acetic acid. The disadvantages are the toxic effects of bromine and the harsh reaction conditions. Reference is also made to Russian Pat. No. SU 1,113,374 (CI. CO7C87/30), 15 Sep 1984, 3,553,280, 28 Dec 1982, wherein tetraethylammonium tribromide is produced by treating tetraethylammonium monobromide with a brominating agent consisting of a solution of an oxidizing agent such as Ce dioxide hydrate or eerie ammonium nitrate in HBr. The disadvantages are the use of toxic hydrobromic acid and production of heavy metal waste.<br>
Reference is made to J. Am. Chem. Soc, 1951, 73, 4525 wherein preparation of tetrabutylammonium tribromide was achieved by mixing a solution of tetrabutylammonium bromide in carbon tetrachloride with bromine. The disadvantages are the use of highly hazardous bromine and environmentally unacceptable toxic halo solvent. Reference is also made to Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn., 1987, 60, 2667 wherein benzyltrimethylammonium tribromide is prepared by adding aqueous HBr to a solution of benzyltrimethylammonium chloride and NaBrO3 in water. The disadvantage is the use of environmentally hazardous hydrobromic acid. Reference is further made to Japanese Patent No. 74 14, 411 (CI. 16 B314); 07 Feb 1974, Appl. 72 58, 343, 12 Jun 1972 wherein cetyltrimethylammonium tribromide was prepared by treating the corresponding monobromide with bromine  in the<br><br>
presence of aqueous HBr. The disadvantages are the use of toxic chemicals like bromine and hydrobromic acid. Objects of the invention<br>

The novelty of the present invention resides in the development of an improved economical and environmentally clean process for the synthesis of quaternary ammonium salts of tribromides of the general formula, QATB where QA is a quaternary ammonium cation selected from the group consisting of tetramethylammonium (TMA), tetraethylammonium (TEA), tetrabutylammonium (TBA), benzyltrimethylammonium (BTMA) and cetyltrimethylammonium (CTMA) and TB (Br3-) is the tribromide anion, by the biomimetic oxidation of quaternary ammonium salts of bromide (Br~) with a peroxo-metal intermediate and KBr in an acidic medium.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for preparing quaternary ammonium tribromide (QATB) which comprises biomimetic oxidation of quaternary ammonium bromide, as a primary source of bromide, with peroxo-metal as an intermediate and KBr-(NH4)Br, as a secondary source of bromide, in an acidic medium, characterized in that the said peroxo-metal intermediate is a transition metal ion mediated activation of an oxidant H2O2, in stochiometric amount and is selected from a group consisting V(V), Mol (V),W(VI),Cu(II) and UO22+, under mild condition, wherein one-third of bromide is obtained from quaternary ammonium bromide (Br-)<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the quaternary ammonium salt of bromide used is selected from the group consisting of tetramethylammonium (TMA), tetraethylammonium (TEA), tetrabutylammonium (TBA), benzyltrimethylammonium (BTMA) and cetyltrimethyl-ammonium (CTMA).<br>

In a further embodiment of the invention, the reaction is carried out in the absence of an organic solvent. Detailed description of the invention<br>
Although bromoorganics take a rather small share of the entire domain of organic chemistry, brominated organic products, especially bromoaromatics enjoy a very special status because of their use in the manufacture of a range of bulk and fine chemicals including flame-retardants, disinfectants, antibacterial and antiviral drugs. The commercial importance of organic bromo derivatives lies in their use as precursors in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and other specialty chemical products.<br>
Recorded methods of synthesis that are largely used in practice involve elemental bromine (Br2) because of its availability and versatility. There is an incentive to find out alternatives to the elemental bromine, since it is highly hazardous to the environment, detrimental to health, noxious and corrosive, which make its<br><br>
transportation, storage and handling extremely difficult. Moreover, the atom accountability in reactions involving bromine is terribly low with clear unquestionable trends of inefficiency and waste.<br>
Interestingly, marine natural chemicals contain bromometabolites such as halogenated phenols, terpenes, C-15 acetogenins and indoles, for example, which are generated through enzyme catalyzed bromination of the metabolites. Studies have revealed that the enzyme responsible for these brominations is something that is called vanadium bromoperoxidase (VBrPO). It is also understood from the knowledge obtained from the structure and reactivity studies of VBrPO that the enzyme interacts first with H2O2 to activate the coordinated peroxide ligand so as to enable it oxidize bromide (Br ~) that is available in the marine natural system to produce active bromine species which in turn is responsible for bromination of organic substrates in the marine environment.<br>
In addition to what has been reviewed above, the fact that hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) on being coordinated to a higher valent transition metal (e.g., V(V), Mo(VI), W(VI), Ti(IV), Cu(II) or UO22+ ) gets activated to perform many reactions. What is equally interesting to note is that the metal, i.e., vanadium occurs in its pentavalent state in VBrPO and that it does not undergo any redox cycling in the catalytic bromination process.<br>
Focus was given in the present investigation into bromide oxidation, the importance of bromoorganics as highlighted above, environmental problems associated with classical brominations by Br2, and the capability of many peroxo complexes of Ti(IV), V(V), Mo(VI) and U022+ to oxidize Br" very effectively in the presence of an acid. The process developed in the present investigation comprises the synthesis of quaternary ammonium salts of tribromides, having the general formula, QATB, a solid bromine, wherein QA is a quaternary ammonium cation selected from the group consisting of tetramethylammonium (TMA), tetraethylammonium (TEA), tetrabutylammonium (TBA), benzyltrimethylammonium (BTMA) and cetyltrimethyl-ammonium (CTMA) and TB (Br3-) is the tribromide anion, obtained in quantitative yields in a reaction comprising the biomimetic oxidation of quaternary ammonium bromide (Br-) with a peroxo-metal intermediate and KBr/NH4Br in an acidic medium.<br>
The use of molecular bromine and the direct use of HBr in the reaction is completely avoided. Instead, the quaternaryammonium bromide (QAB) is used as the primary source of bromide. If desired, a secondary source of bromide such as KBr or<br><br>
NtLtBr or any other appropriate bromide. The quaternaryammonium bromide (QAB) is oxidized to quaternaryammonium tribromide (QATB) with the bromide oxidation being conducted under mild conditions. When both a primary and secondary source of bromide are used, one-third of the bromide is preferably derived from the quaternary ammonium bromide and two-third is afforded by the secondary source of bromide. KBr is preferred as the secondary source of bromide since it is a cheap source of bromide.<br>
The oxidant used is aqueous hydrogen peroxide which is environmentally benign oxidant, in stoichiometric amounts. Higher valent transition metal catalysts V(V) and Mo(VI) are used in catalytic amounts for activation of hydrogen peroxide. The peroxo- transition metal is selected from V(V), Mo(VI), W(VI), Ti(IV), Cu(II), UO22+ or any other metal capable of activating hydrogen peroxide. The use of the metal ion renders hydrogen peroxide more reactive. The acidic medium itself is used as promoter for bromide oxidation. The acids are preferably chosen from sulfuric acid and perchloric acid. The reaction proceeds due to the conversion of monobromide is converted to tribromide.<br>
No organic solvent is needed for the reactions. Another significant advantage is that not only is no waste is produced in the process, the reactions are rapid and facile with products being obtained in high or quantitative yields without requiring any recrystallization. QATBs obtained by the process of the invention are comparatively far more stable and have a long shelf life since no HBr is used in the processes. SCIENTIFIC EXPLANATION<br>
The principle of the present invention is to prepare quaternaryammonium<br>
tribromides by novel, economic and environmentally clean processes. The scientific<br>
philosophy behind these principles is depicted in scheme 1:<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
Scheme 1. Mechanistic Pathway for QATB Synthesis<br>
The mechanism (Scheme 1) may be explained in terms of the following steps:<br>
(i)        Activation of peroxide through coordination to a higher valent metal ion.<br>
(ii)       Opening up of the peroxo ring in the presence of acid, (not shown in the<br>
scheme)<br>
(iii)      Oxidation of bromide.<br>
(iv)      Isolation of Br3- from solution by precipitation with a heavy cation.<br>
Two general protocols have been developed to provide easy accesses to the<br>
commercially important quatemaryammonium tribromides. Thus we have disclosed<br>
herein two different methods of preparation of QATBs, viz., Protocol A and Protocol<br>
B. Though the two methods are apparently similar, the Protocol A differs from the<br>
Protocol B in terms of the quantity of water used in the two preparations. Each<br>
method has an advantage over the other.<br>
Protocol A uses an excess of water to help remove the soluble salt(s) but<br>
affording the products in slightly lower yields,<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
Scheme 2<br>
Protocol B uses only a restricted quantity of water that owes its origin to the hydrogen peroxide and acid solutions. This provides a more effective interaction among the reactants and averts any loss due to solubility of QATBs. However, one extraction step is necessary in order to render QATBs free from the salt of the acid.<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
Scheme 3<br>
The following examples are given by way illustration and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
Protocol A is applied for examples 1 to 5 and Protocol B for examples 6 to 10.<br>
