PRIORITY E911 CALL BACK DURING ACCESS CLASS RESTRICTIONS<br><br>
Technical Field<br>
5<br>
The present invention generally relates to an apparatus and a method for<br>
receiving an emergency call, and more specifically to an apparatus and a method for<br>
receiving an emergency call during network access class restrictions.<br>
10<br>
Background Art<br><br>
In today's Global System for Mobile Communications ("GSM") and Third<br>
Generation Partnership Project ("3GPP") systems for cellular telephone networks, a<br>
15     mobile telephone in a network is capable of placing an emergency call even when<br>
access for other calls are restricted by the network during a time of access class<br>
restrictions. The network may initiate access class restrictions for various reasons.<br>
For example, some base stations in an area may fail, which causes congestion, or<br>
there may exist a state of emergency such as an earthquake or a wide-spread fire<br>
20     where the network may deny access for normal calls and only allow access for<br>
emergency calls. The access is controlled by the network by assigning an access class<br>
in the range of 0 to 9 to all mobile telephones as described in the technical<br>
specification, 3GPP TS 22.011 V4.8.0 (002-09). Access class 10 is signaled over the<br>
air by the network to mobile telephones indicating whether network access for<br>
25      emergency calls is allowed for mobile telephones with access classes 0 to 9. During a<br>
time of access class restrictions, the network prohibits mobile telephones belonging to<br>
the barred access classes from accessing the network to place and receive a call,<br>
although access to the network, for emergency calls is allowed as long as access class<br>
10 has not been barred by the network. However, having made the emergency call,<br>
30     the mobile telephone not belonging to one of the allowed access classes is still barred<br>
from receiving a call during the time of access class restrictions. For example, a call<br>
-1-<br><br>
WO 2004/072784    PCT/US2004/003336<br><br>
back from an emergency service provider is barred even though it is an emergency-<br>
related call.<br>

Disclosure of the Invention<br><br>
The present invention provides an apparatus and a method for receiving an<br>
incoming emergency call back in a wireless communication network during a time of<br>
5      network access control restrictions. During the network access control restrictions, all<br>
calls are barred except for calls to and from those mobile telephones belonging to.<br>
allowed access classes, except for emergency calls initiated from a mobile telephone<br>
and incoming emergency calls back to that mobile telephone.<br>
FIG. 1 is an exemplary block diagram of a wireless communication device 100<br>
10     having emergency call back reception functionality in accordance with a preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The wireless communication device 100 may<br>
be, but is not limited to, a radiotelephone such as a cellular phone or two-way radio, a<br>
paging device, a personal digital assistant ("PDA"), a handheld computer, an<br>
audio/video device such as a television or an MP3 player, a network browsing device,<br>
15      a tablet for a pen, a touchpad for a finger or a pen, a touch keypad for a finger, a<br>
virtual pen, or any type of computing and communicating device. The wireless<br>
communication device 100 includes an antenna 102, a transceiver 104, a processor<br>
106, a display 108, a user interface 110, an audio input and output 112, a memory<br>
circuit 114, and a timing circuit 116. Upon reception of wireless signals, the wireless<br>
20      communication device 100 detects the signals through the antenna 102 to produce<br>
detected voice and/or data signals. The transceiver 104, coupled to the antenna 102,<br>
converts the detected signals into electrical baseband signals and demodulates the<br>
electrical baseband signals to recover incoming information, such as voice and/or<br>
data, transmitted by the wireless signals. After receiving the incoming information<br>
25     from the transceiver 104, the processor 106 formats the incoming information for<br>
output to the display 108 and/or audio input and output 112. Likewise, for<br>
transmission of wireless signals, the processor 106 formats, outgoing information and<br>
conveys it to the transceiver 104 for modulation of a carrier and conversion into<br>
modulated signals. The transceiver 104 conveys the modulated signals to the antenna<br>
30      102 for transmission to a remote transceiver (not shown).<br>
Input and output devices of the wireless communication device 100 may<br>
include a variety of visual, audio and/or motion devices. The output devices may<br>

WO 2004/072784                                                                                            PCT/US2004/003336<br><br>
include, but are not limited to, the display 108 and the audio outputs such as speakers<br>
alarms and buzzers of the audio input and output 112. The display 108 may include<br>
liquid crystal displays, light emitting diode indicators, or any other displays. The<br>
input devices may include, but are not limited to, the user input 110 and audio inputs<br>
5      of the audio input and output 112. The user input 110 may include keyboards, key<br>
pads, selection buttons, touch pads, touch screens, capacitive sensors, motion sensors,<br>
switches, or any other user inputs. The audio input of the audio input and output 112<br>
may include a microphone or any other audio input.<br>
The internal components, of the wireless communication device 100 further<br>
10      include the memory circuit 114 for storing and retrieving data and the timing circuit<br>
116. The processor 106 may perform various operations to store, manipulate and<br>
retrieve information in the memory circuit 114.<br>
Timing information regarding a predefined time period for which the wireless<br>
communication device 100 is able to receive the incoming call is stored in the<br>
15      memory circuit 114 along with duration information specifying how long the<br>
predefined time period has been in effect. The liming circuit 116 may include clock<br>
circuitry that provides the current time and/or a timer that provides elapsed time from<br>
a particular starting time such as the beginning of the duration of the predefined time<br>
period. It is to be understood that, for the invention described herein, the word "time"<br>
20      is used broadly to include calendar dates as well as times of day and other time<br>
periods.<br>
The internal components of the wireless communication device 100 may<br>
further include a component Interface 118 and a power supply 120. Accessories and<br>
additional components such as a user module 122 may be coupled to the component<br>
25      interface 118 to provide additional functionality and capabilities to the device 100.<br>
The power supply 120, such as a battery, is controlled by the processor 106 and<br>
provides power to the internal components so that they may function correctly.<br>
The processor 106 compares the access class broadcast by the network to<br>
verity access class-10 is enabled before originating an emergency call. If the<br>
30      emergency call is assigned a channel for communication thereby gaining access to the<br>
network, the timing circuit 116 marks the channel assignment time as the start of the<br>
predefined time period and begins tracking the elapsed time. During the predefined<br>
-4-<br><br>
WO 2004/072784                                                                                            PCT/US2004/003336<br><br>
time period, the processor 106 accepts an incoming page provided that the network is<br>
allowing access class 10. Unless the processor 106 determines that the elapsed time<br>
has exceeded the predefined time period, the processor 106 allows the incoming calls<br>
to be received while the network is operating with access class restrictions.<br>
5                FIG. 2 is an exemplary flow chart 200 outlining the operation of the wireless<br>
communication device 100 according to a first embodiment. The process begins in<br>
block 202, and the wireless communication device 100 monitors current access class<br>
setting in block 204, When a call is initiated, the wireless communication device 100<br>
determines whether the call is an emergency call in block 206. If the call is not an<br>
10      emergency call, the wireless communication device 100 proceeds normally in block<br>
208, and the process terminates in block 210. If the call is an emergency call, then the<br>
allowed in block 212. If access class 10 is not allowed, then the wireless<br>
communication device 100 terminates the call by rejecting the call in block 214, and<br>
15      the process terminates in block 210. However, if the call is an emergency call and<br>
access class 10 is allowed, then the wireless communication device 100 connects the<br>
call in block 216. The wireless communication device 100 then begins to monitor for<br>
incoming calls for a predefined time period in block 218, and the process terminates<br>
in block 210.<br>
20                    FIG. 3 is an exemplary flow chart further describing block 218 of FIG. 2<br>
according to a preferred embodiment. After the emergency call has been transmitted<br>
in block 216, the wireless communication device 100 monitors a channel assignment<br>
for the call in block 302, and may re-try the emergency call for a predetermined<br>
number of times in block 304 if no channel is assigned to the emergency call, i.e. if<br>
25     the call is unsuccessful. If the call is assigned a channel, then the wireless<br>
communication device 100 marks the beginning of the predefined time period, and<br>
starts tracking the elapsed time of the predefined time period in block 306. Whether<br>
the elapsed time has exceeded the predefined time period such as 45 minutes or a<br>
certain length in time otherwise provided is checked in block 308. If the elapsed time<br>
30      is within the predefined time period, the wireless communication device 100<br>
continues to respond to incoming calls according to emergency access class in block<br>
310, and continues to monitor the elapsed time in block 308, Upon expiration of the<br>
-5-<br><br>
WO 2004/072784                                                                                            PCT/US2004/003336<br><br>
predefined time period, the wireless communication device 100 terminates the process<br>
in block 210. Monitoring of the elapsed time may be accomplished by using an<br>
internal clock of the wireless communication device 100 or receiving time<br>
information from an external time source such as a network time source. The<br>
5     predefined time period may be defined to run from the time the successful channel<br>
assignment made or from the time the emergency call has terminated. The<br>
predefined time period may be renewed upon initiating a new emergency call to the<br>
emergency service provider, or upon receiving a call hack from the emergency service<br>
provider.<br>
10                  FIG. 4 is an exemplary flow chart further describing block 310 of FIG. 3<br>
according to a preferred embodiment. The wireless communication device 100<br>
monitors an appropriate paging block for a page for an incoming call in block 402,<br>
and continues to monitor the current access class setting in block 404. If a page is<br>
detected, then the wireless communication device 100 determines whether the<br>
15      incoming call associated with the page is addressed to the wireless communication<br>
device 100 in block 406. If the incoming call is not addressed to the wireless<br>
communication device 100, then the process repeats from block 402. If the incoming<br>
call is addressed in the wireless communication device 100, then the wireless<br>
communication device 100 determines whether the access class 10 is currently<br>
20       allowed in block 408. If the access class 10 is not currently allowed, then the wireless<br>
communication device 100 does not respond to the page, and the process returns to<br>
block 308. If the access class 10 is currently allowed, the wireless communication<br>
device 100 determines whether the priority level of the incoming call, which may be<br>
indicated by information included in the page, is high in block 410.  If the priority<br>
25       level is high, indicating that the incoming call is an emergency related call, then the<br>
wireless communication device 100 responds to the, page in block 412, and processes<br>
the call in block 414. The process then returns to block 308. If the priority level is<br>
not high, then the wireless communication device 100 does not respond to the page,<br>
find the process returns to block 308. Alternatively, if the access class 10 is currently<br>
30     allowed, the wireless communication device 100 may first respond to the page, then<br>
determine whether the priority level of the incoming call is high by using information<br>
received after responding to the page. If the priority level is high, then the wireless<br>
-6-<br><br>
WO 2004/072784                                                                                            PCT/US2004/003336<br><br>
communication device 100 processes the call, and than the process returns to block<br>
308. If the priority level is not high, then the process returns to block 308 without<br>
processing the call.<br>
FIG. 5 is an exemplary block diagram of an environment where the present<br>
5     invention may be practiced according to a preferred embodiment. In the exemplary<br>
environment, there exists a wireless communication network 500 comprising a<br>
wireless communication device 502, a base station 504, and an emergency service<br>
center 506, all of which may be connected wirelessly as shown with, radio frequency<br>
signal 508 and 510.<br>
10                 FIG. 6 is an exemplary flow chart 600 outlining the operation of the wireless<br>
communication network 500 of FIG. 5 according to a preferred embodiment. The<br>
process begins in block 602. The network 500 receives an emergency call from the<br>
wireless communication device 502 in block 604, and the network 500 assigns a<br>
channel for the emergency call in block 606. The network 500 then establishes the<br>
15      emergency call to the emergency service center 506 in block 608, and as the<br>
communication, between the wireless communication device 502 and the emergency<br>
service center 504 is established the network assists the emergency service center 504<br>
for a return call to the wireless communication device 502 by providing a telephone<br>
number associated with the wireless communication device 502 in block 610. The<br>
20     process then terminates in block 6\2,<br>
FIG. 7 is an exemplary flowchart 700 describing a call back process from the<br>
emergency service center 506 to the wireless communication device 502. The process<br>
begins in block 702. The network 500 during access control restriction receives a<br>
return call having a telephone number, which identifies the wireless communication<br>
25      device 502, from the emergency service center 506 in block 704 after tha emergency<br>
call from the wireless communication device 502 has been terminated. By using the<br>
telephone number provided by the emergency services center 506, the network<br>
identifies the targeted wireless communication device 502 in block 706 as the wireless<br>
communication device which made the initial emergency call, and pages, the identified<br>
30     wireless communication device 502 in block 708. The network 500 also identifies the<br>
return call from the emergency service center 506 with priority level, which is set to<br>
high for being originated from the emergency service center in block 710. The<br>
