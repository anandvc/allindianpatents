FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention, in general, relates to the field of multi-functional peripherals. More particularly, the current invention relates to a method for reserving a MFP for a particular time frame.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
Currently, multi-functional peripherals (MFP) can handle only either a copy or print job because they can handle only the incoming print request, (i.e. the user who needs to perform a copy/print has to wait for any network jobs being fired first in case of a networked MFP).<br>
With MFPs, if a user wants to perform a copy operation, what he/she does normally is to come up to the device and place the paper (which he/she wants to copy) either in the automatic document feeder (ADF) or in the optical character recognition (OCR) bed. The sensors which are placed near them gets activated automatically by the touch/sense of the user and sends an electric signal to the corresponding units in MFP, which accordingly block/buffer the incoming network print jobs. But the major disadvantage with such mpdels is that it is susceptible to hardware sensor errors borne out of inadvertent human mishandling.<br>
For example, if a user unknowingly touches/ opens the automatic document feeder (ADF)/optical character recognition (OCR) bed, there is every possibility in the world that the sensors may get activated and the signals which it sends block/buffer the network print jobs. The sensors behave the same way for all the users. In other words, there are chances for the higher priority network print jobs being blocked by the sensors when such inadvertent sensor errors occur.<br>
In prior art, the patent titled "Electronic Device and Program" (JP2006109254) describes how an MFP receives reservation request of copying job from a personal computer, waits for a while even if a memory is not secured, secures<br><br>
necessary memory for the job execution, and sends a reservation key which is identification for the memory to the personal computer. The user then specifies the reservation key, and makes the MFP execute copying.<br>
Another patent, titled "Backup control method for image forming device" (JP2006252054), explains in detail how a server notifies the user of a personal computer (a user terminal) of the presence of unexecuted reservation job. According to the invention, the MFP then executes the reservation job in response to impartment of an instruction of the effect that the unexecuted reservation job has to be executed to the MFP from the personal computer for the user.<br>
Even though, the prior art documents talks about different ways to reserve a print job with an MFP, none of them explicitly mentions how the specific operation in the MFP (e.g.: copy) is being performed within a time limit. The users whose network print jobs are being blocked / buffered are not being intimated about the status of their print jobs in the network either. Also they are not intimated about the status of the user who has reserved the MFP for his own (e.g.: copy) purpose.<br>
In the light of thef foregoing shortcomings in the related art, the 'applicant's invention is herein presented. The present invention details a method by which a user could reserve an MFP for a particular time duration remotely using an embedded web server page/ status monitor application. It also saves a lot of time for the standby user who wants to perform a copy operation on a networked MFP.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore the primary object of the invention to provide a method for reserving an MFP for a particular time duration.<br><br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a method for reserving an MFP online.<br>
It is yet another object of the invention to inform the other users in the network about the status of their jobs in the network and the name of the user who had reserved the MFP.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to ensure that all network jobs from the other users in the network are blocked/buffered for the time duration to which the MFP has been reserved.<br>
It is yet another object of the invention to have a time limit based reservation technique by which the MFP could dislodge the reserve request on the expiry of the time limit.<br>
It is another object of the invention to have an upper limit to the time frame for which the MFP can be reserved at a time.<br>
Accordingly, the invention provides for a method for reserving an MFP remotely for a particular time frame, the method comprising,<br>
•	Reserving the MFP for a particular time frame from the embedded web server page/ status monitor application.<br>
•	Sending the reserve request from the network interface card (NIC) firmware to the main firmware by an already existing protocol.<br>
•	Processing the request by the multi-functional peripheral firmware and blocking/buffering the print jobs from the network for the requested time duration.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawing(s).<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 depicts a diagram of a user reserving the MFP from the embedded web server page.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However, in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
The present invention provides an option for a user to reserve a networked MFP. In a networked MFP, there are possibilities of the device being populated by a large number of print jobs at a time. In such cases, the user who needs to perform a copy operation has to wait till the MFP finishes the print jobs, which are fired from other users in the network. This invention provides the user an alternative, an option to reserve the MFP for a particular period of time. That is, when the user wants to reserve an MFP, he just has to open the embedded web server page (supported for network models)/status monitor application and click on the reserve MFP button. The action prompts for a time value, which the user has to specify. During this time period, the MFP will be reserved for the user.<br>
According to the current design/architecture, embedded web server (EWS) is the server that will be running on the network (NIC) firmware. User opens the EWS page on his client (PC). This page is basically supported by the embedded web<br><br>
server (EWS) that is running on the network firmware. This is similar to a yahoo server that runs somewhere in US and various users accessing their web page at different PCs and at from different countries. However, embedded web server is something that has got very less footprint (memory) unlike the normal web servers to cater the embedded devices. This is an already existing thing in many embedded devices.<br>
For reference: http://www.dilnetpc.com/WSforES1-1.pdf.<br>
As another embodiment of the present invention, the option for reserving the MFP can also be provided in the existing GUI (graphical user interface) panel that is there in the MFP. This will enable users who don't have a PC or somebody standing next to the device to reserve the MFP.<br>
Fig 1 shows the diagram of a user reserving the MFP. This can be explained in detail as follows. When the user wants to reserve the MFP for a particular purpose (e.g.: a copy operation) the user is provided with a check box in the existing embedded web server page (supported for network models). The check box can be provided in other multi functionality peripheral monitoring applications as well. The user who wants to perform a copy (say) will select this button to reserve the corresponding MFP. A time limit will also be provided alongside the reserve option. This time limit is provided with the intention that the MFP should not be reserved for a long time by a single user, which will prevent the other users from accessing the MFP concerned.<br>
The time limit signifies the time before which the copy activity should be finished. In other words, when a user reserves the MFP to perform a copy operation and gives a time limit of 5 minutes, then he is expected to finish the copy operation within 5 minutes. Otherwise his request will be dislodged by the MFP.<br>
Once the user enters the time limit for reserving the MFP, the following sequence of operations will take place.<br><br>
•<br><br>
The request from the embedded web server page is transferred from the network interface card (NIC) firmware to the main firmware by an already existing protocol between them. Also the time limit which the user provided is sent along with the reserve request.<br>
The multi-functional peripheral firmware on receiving these requests blocks/buffers the print jobs from the network. It also waits for a copy operation for the time limit specified by the user. So within this time limit, the user is supposed to finish his copy operation. If a copy operation is not performed within the time limit, the MFP dislodges the reserve request made by the user and starts allowing network pint jobs to execute.<br>
If the copy operation is being performed within the time limit, the MFP blocks/buffers the network print jobs that are fired from other systems in the network and also intimates the users from where the network print jobs being fired about the status of their print jobs and also about the user who has reserved the MFP for copy purpose.<br><br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a microchip, microprocessor, handheld communication device, computer, rendering device or a multi function device.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart there from.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
