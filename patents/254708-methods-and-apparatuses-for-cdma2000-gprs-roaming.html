QUALCOMM Incorporated, a corporation under the laws of state Delaware of United States of America of 5775 Morehouse Drive, San Diego, California 92121-1714, United States of America<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
WO 2005/057961		PCTAJS2004/040432<br><br>
METHODS AND APPARATUSES FOR CDMA2000/GPRS ROAMING<br>
Claim of Priority under 35 U.S.C. §119<br>
[0001]	The present Application for Patent claims priority to Provisional Application<br>
No. 60/526,557 entitled "CDMA/GPRS Packet Data Roaming" filed December 3,2003, and assigned to the assignee hereof and hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein.<br>
BACKGROUND Field<br>
[0002]	The present disclosed embodiments relate generally to wireless communications,<br>
and more specifically to roaming in the context of CDMA2000 and GPRS systems.<br>
Background<br>
(0003)	Wireless subscribers may desire to use their wireless terminals in conjunction<br>
with wireless systems other than their home systems to obtain access to services using their existing subscriptions. Access to these services may be independent of their normal wireless terminals, through wireless systems other than their home systems. This may occur, for example, when the subscriber is roaming outside the service area of their home system. Accordingly, manufacturers and system operators desire to allow subscribers to receive services using their terminals and subscriptions via a system which may not be the subscriber's home system, provided mat the terminal and the servmg system are compatible.<br>
[0004]	Serving roaming subscribers can be difficult even when the servmg system and<br>
home system employ identical technologies. When the serving system uses an air interface that differs from that used in the subscriber's home system, interworking between these systems is typically performed due to fundamental differences in message protocols, call models, et cetra. This interworking can be achieved via an Interworking and Interoperability Function (IIF).<br>
[0005]	One example of an IIF is described in US Patent Application 2002/094811 Al to<br>
Bright et al. entitled "Interworking and Interoperability of GPRS Systems With Systems of Other Technology Families."  US Patent Application 2002/094811 Al provides a<br><br>
WO 2005/057961		PCT/US2WM/04JM32<br>
GPRS interworking and interoperability function (IIF) interposed between a serving<br>
GSM/GPRS wireless system and a second wireless system of a different technology<br>
family. The IIF allows a mobile station homed to the second wireless system to operate<br>
in the GSM/GPRS system. According to US Patent Application 2002/094811 Al,<br>
telecommunications system components are provided that allow interworking and<br>
interoperability of a serving GSM and/or GPRS system with certain "domestic wireless"<br>
systems. For example, a mobile station homed on such a domestic wireless system, but<br>
registered with the serving system in a GPRS-only mode, may receive services from the<br>
serving system. US Patent Application 2002/094811 Al mentions that the term<br>
"domestic wireless" (DW) is intended to refer to non-GSM systems compatible with<br>
ANSI or equivalent standards for TDMA, CDMA, and analog cellular systems, as<br>
generally used in North America, or compatible with other similar systems.<br>
(0006]	Although US Patent Application 2002/094811 Al acknowledges the need for an<br>
HF allows a mobile station homed to a CDMA wireless system to operate in the<br>
GSM/GPRS system, US Patent Application 2002/094811 Al does not discuss an ID?<br>
adapted for CDMA2000/GPRS roaming scenarios when the terminal is using Mobile IP<br>
or Simple IP. US Patent Application 2002/094811 Al fails to provide sufficient<br>
information, direction or guidance regarding how an DF could be constructed that<br>
would allow a mobile station homed to a CDMA2000 wireless system could operate in<br>
the GSM/GPRS system, when the terminal is using Mobile IP or Simple IP. For<br>
example, US Patent Application 2002/094811 Al fails to provide any details regarding<br>
what modules would be needed to implement such an DF, how the modules would be<br>
interconnected, timed and controlled so as to obtain the specific operations needed to<br>
implement such an DF.<br>
[0007]	Thus, there is a need in the art for a general architecture can be adapted for<br>
CDMA2000/GPRS roaming scenarios, such as, GPRS foreign mode with Mobile D?v4, GPRS foreign mode with Simple D*v4 or DV6, CDMA2000 packet data foreign mode with Mobile D°v4, and CDMA2000 packet data foreign mode with Simple D?, Mobile D?v4 or Mobile D?v6. It would be desirable to enable communication between a CDMA 2000 packet data system and a GPRS system, when a CDMA 2000 packet data native subscriber using Simple D\ Mobile D?v4 or Mobile D?v6 roams to the GPRS system by supporting bearer connectivity between the GPRS and CDMA 2000 packet data system. Similarly, it would also be desirable to enable communication between a GPRS system<br><br>
WO 21*05/057961		PCT/US2004/040432<br>
and a CDMA 2000 packet data system when a GPRS native subscriber roams from the GPRS system to the CDMA 2000 packet data system using Simple IP, Mobile IPv4 or Mobile IPv6 by supporting bearer connectivity between the GPRS system and the CDMA 2000 packet data system.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
(0008)	According to one aspect of the invention, an interface entity, interposed between<br>
a CDMA 2000 packet data system and a GPRS system, is provided that enables communication between the CDMA 2000 packet data system and the GPRS system when a CDMA 2000 packet data native subscriber roams to the GPRS system by supporting bearer connectivity between the GPRS and CDMA 2000 packet data system by providing a packet routing function.<br>
[0009}	According to one aspect of the invention, an interface entity is provided that<br>
enables communication between a home CDMA 2000 packet data system and a visited GPRS system comprising a Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN),when a CDMA 2000 packet data native subscriber using Mobile IPv4 roams to a visited GPRS system.<br>
[0010}	For example, in an embodiment where a CDMA 2000 packet data native<br>
subscriber roams to a visited system and uses Mobile IPv4, an interface entity can be provided that couples the home system to the visited system to enable communication between the home system and the visited system. In this situation, the home system is a CDMA 2000 packet data system that can include a ANSI-41 home location register; an AAA entity; and a home agent, whereas the visited system can be a GPRS system that includes a SGSN.<br>
[0011}	According to one aspect of this embodiment, the interface comprises a GSM<br>
home location register emulation module, and an ANSI-41 visited location register emulation module. The GSM home location register emulation module can be coupled to the SGSN via a Gr interface, that allows a subscriber to register over a Gr interface, whereas the ANSI-41 visited location register emulation module can be coupled to the ANSI-41 home location register via a D interface that allows a subscriber to register over the D interface.

function between the GGSN interface and the foreign agent interface. According to<br>
another aspect of this embodiment, the interface can also include an AAA emulation<br>
module that can be coupled to the AAA entity via an X3 interface. In this embodiment,<br>
the AAA emulation module provides an accounting function to interacting with a home<br>
network's AAA for Mobile IP Foreign Agent challenge authentication and 3GPP2<br>
packet data accounting.<br>

The GSM home location register can be coupled to the SGSN via a Gr interface and allows a subscriber to register over the Gr interface. According to another aspect of this embodiment, the interface may comprise a LAC emulation module and a GGSN emulation module. The LAC emulation module can be coupled to the LNS via an X2 interface, and supports bearer connectivity between the visited and home networks over the X2 interface. The GGSN emulation module can be coupled to the SGSN via a Gp interface, and supports bearer connectivity between the visited and home networks over the Gp interface by<br><br>
WO 2»M&gt;5/I&gt;57%1		PCT/US2004/040432<br><br>
presenting a GGSN interface to the visited system and presenting a normal routing<br>
interface to the CDMA 2000 packet data system to thereby provide a packet routing<br>
function between the GGSN interface and the home system, m this case, the interface<br>
serves as an endpoint for a GTP tunnel and an IPSec tunnel. According to yet another<br>
aspect of this embodiment, the interface can include an AAA emulation module that can<br>
be coupled to the AAA entity via an X3 interface. The AAA emulation module can<br>

between a GPRS system to a CDMA 2000 packet data system, is provided that enables<br>
communication between the GPRS system and the CDMA 2000 packet data system<br>
when a GPRS native subscriber roams from the GPRS system to a CDMA 2000 packet<br>
data system using one of Mobile IPv4 and Simple IP by supporting bearer connectivity<br>
between the GPRS system and the CDMA 2000 packet data system by providing a<br>
packet Touting function.<br>
[0016]	According to yet another aspect of the invention, an interface entity is provided<br>
that enables communication between a home GPRS system comprising a GSM home<br>
location register, a GGSN, and an AAA entity, and a visited CDMA 2000 packet data<br>
system that comprises an ANSI-41 visited location register, an AAA entity, and a<br>
packet data serving node/ foreign agent, when a GPRS native subscriber using Mobile<br>
IPv4 roams to the visited CDMA 2000 packet data system.<br>
[0017]	In an embodiment where a GPRS native subscriber roams to a visited system<br>
and uses Mobile IPv4, an interface entity can be provided that couples the home system<br>
to the visited system to enable communication between the home system and the visited<br>
system. In this situation, the home system is a GPRS system comprising a GSM home<br>
location register; a GGSN; and an AAA entity, whereas the visited system can comprise<br>

emulation module can be coupled to the ANSI-41 visited location register via a D<br>
interface, whereas the GSM visited location register emulation module can be coupled<br>
to the GSM home location register via a D interface, to allow a subscriber to register.<br>
According to yet another aspect of this embodiment, the interface may also include an<br>
AAA emulation module that can be coupled to the AAA entity via a Gi interface and<br>
coupled to the AAA entity via a X3 interface.  The AAA emulation module interacts<br>
with the visited network's AAA for Mobile IP authentication and 3GPP2 packet data<br>
accounting, over the X3 interface, and the home network's AAA for 3GPP packet data<br>
accounting, over the Gi interface.<br>
[0019]	According to one aspect of the invention, an interface entity is provided that<br>
enables communication between a home GPRS system comprising a GSM home<br>
location register, a GGSN, and an AAA entity, and a visited CDMA 2000 packet data<br>
system that comprises an ANSI-41 visited location register, an AAA entity, and a<br>
packet data serving node/LAC entity, when a GPRS native subscriber using Simple IP<br>

(0053]	FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a system that comprises a home system 10, such as<br>
a CDMA 2000 packet data system or a GPRS system, a visited system 20, such as a GPRS system or a CDMA 2000 packet data system, and an interface entity 30 or "IIF" that couples the home system 10 to the visited system 20, and enables communication between the home system 10 and the visited system 20.<br>
(0054)	The   following  sections  describe  architectures  that  can  be  adapted   for<br>
CDMA2000/GPRS roaming scenarios, such as, GPRS foreign mode with Mobile IPv4, GPRS foreign mode with Simple IPv4 or IPv6, CDMA2000 packet data foreign mode with Mobile IPv4, and CDMA2000 packet data foreign mode with Simple IPv4 or IPv6.<br>
GPRS Foreign Mode with Mobile IPv4<br>
[0055]	FIG. 2A is an exemplary block diagram of a GPRS foreign mode with Mobile<br>
IPv4, and depicts the functions and control interface provided by an IIF in this<br>
embodiment. This roaming scenario occurs when a CDMA2000 packet data native<br>
subscriber operates Mobile IPv4 [IS-835-C] in GPRS foreign mode. In this<br>
embodiment, the home system 10 can be a CDMA 2000 packet data system wherein a<br>
CDMA 2000 packet data native subscriber roams to a GPRS system and uses Mobile<br>
IPv4. The home system 10 comprises a ANSI-41 home location register 131, an AAA<br>
entity 116, and a home agent 135. The visited system 20 can be a GPRS system that<br>
comprises a Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) 137. The Serving GPRS Support<br>
Node keeps track of the location of an individual mobile station and performs security<br>
functions and access control. The AAA entity can be used to securely determine the<br>
. identity and privileges of a user and to track that user's activities.<br>
(00561	The interface 30 or "IDF" comprises an ANSI-41 visited location register 111<br>
coupled to the ANSI-41 home location register 131 via a D interface 113, a GSM home location register 124 coupled to the Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) 137 via a Gr interface 123, a Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) 126 coupled to the Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) 137 via a Gp interface 127 and coupled to the Internet via a Gi interface, an AAA entity 140 coupled to the AAA entity 116 via an X3 interface 117, and a foreign agent 118 coupled to the home agent 135 via an XI interface 115. The Gr interface is a GPRS interface which is located between the SGSN (Serving GPRS Support Node) and the HLR (Home Location Register). When the GGSN (Gateway GPRS Support Node) and the SGSN (Serving GPRS Support Node) are<br><br>
WO 2005/057961	| %	PCT/US2004/040432<br>
located in different networks, they may be interconnected via the Gp interface which<br>
provides similar functionality to that of the Gn interface, however it usually includes<br>
extra security functionality which is based on mutual agreements between operators.<br>
The Gi Interface is a GPRS interface which is located between the GGSN (Gateway<br>
GPRS Support Node) and the external PDN (Public Data Network). The Gateway<br>
GPRS Support Node supports the edge routing function of the GPRS network. To<br>
external packet data networks the GGSN performs the task of an IP router. Firewall and<br>
filtering functionality, to protect the integrity of the GPRS core network, are also<br>
associated with the GGSN along with a billing function.<br>
I0057J	The IDF provides both GSM HLR and ANSI-41 VLR emulation to allow the<br>
subscriber to register. This interworking can be provided over the interface references<br>
"Gr" and "D." The Home Location Register (HLR) is a database found within cellular<br>
networks. It stores subscriber data relating to services and features in addition to<br>
location area based information. In the context of GSM, the Home Location Register is<br>
a database within the HPLMN (Home Public Land Mobile Network). It provides<br>
routing information for MT (Mobile Terminated) calls and SMS (Short Message<br>
Service). It is also responsible for the maintenance of user subscription information.<br>
This is distributed to the relevant VLR (Visitor Location Register) or SGSN (Serving<br>
GPRS Support Node) through the attach process and mobility management procedures<br>
such as Location Area and Routing Area updates. The Visitor Location Register (VLR)<br>
contains all subscriber data required for call handling and mobility management for<br>
mobile subscribers currently located m the area controlled by the VLR.<br>
[00S8J	The DP also provides Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) and FA emulation<br>
to support bearer connectivity between the visited and home networks via the ID?. This<br>
interworking can be provided over the interface references "Gn" and "XI." The DP<br>
provides AAA emulation to interact with the home network's AAA for Mobile D?<br>
Foreign Agent challenge authentication and 3GPP2 packet data accounting. This<br>
interworking can be provided over the interface reference "X3."<br>
{0059]	If bearer connectivity between from the GPRS system and the CDMA2000<br>
packet data system is not required, then reverse tunneling on the XI interface is not required. Rather, MS-terminated traffic traverses through the XI and Gp interfaces. In the case where reverse tunneling is not required, the DF routes MS-originated traffic, received on a Gp interface, to the Internet directly via a Gi interface.<br><br>
WO 2005/057%]		PCT/US2004/040432<br>
[0060]	Thus, for a user homed in a CDMA Mobile IP system roaming to a GSM<br>
system, the HF may present a Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) interface to GSM and a FA and AAA interfaces to the CDMA system. The IIF may serve as the endpoint for the GTP and Mobile IP tunnels, with a packet routing function between the Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) and FA. GPRS Tunnelling Protocol is employed on the Gn interface in order to tunnel user data between different GGSN. The Gn interface is a GPRS interface which is located between the GSN (GPRS Support Nodes). Version zero of the protocol supports both signalling and user data under one generic header. It can be used with UDP User Datagram Protocol (UDP) or Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).<br>
{0061]	The IIF may also provide an accounting function so that operators can charge<br>
based on configurable measurements such as packet count, bandwidth, time of day, etc.<br>
(0062]	FIG. 2B is an exemplary call flow diagram that shows Mobile IPv4 operation in<br>
the GPRS foreign mode. FIG. 2B depicts a call flow example for the roaming scenario where a CDMA2000 packet data native subscriber operates Mobile IPv4 [IS-835-C] in the GPRS foreign mode. In this example, the MS has shared secrets with the home CDMA2000 system for Mobile IP authentication. The MS may request the home CDMA2000 system to assign a HA and/or an IP address. The reverse tunneling can be enabled so that all data traffic (MS-originated and -terminated) traverses through the IIF and home CDMA2000 system. The IIF generates 3GPP2 packet data accounting records and sends it to the home CDMA2000 system via RADIUS.<br>
[0063]	The MS performs GPRS attach with a SGSN.   The authentication associated<br>
with the GPRS attach can be a SIM-based authentication requiring the Ki secret key. The IEF acts as the GSM HLR configured with the Ki secret. In any case, the IEF can be not required to communicate with the HLR in the home CDMA2000 system for the authentication. (Step 1) The MS sends the Activate PDP Context Request to the SGSN. The message includes the Access Point Name (APN). The APN has the format <network dd>.<mno. the network id cdma2000carrier.com indicates to which external ms wants estabhsh a logical connection. requested pdp address can be omitted in message. has static mobile ip home or obtains new address. serving gprs support node selects gateway based on apn. uses apn as lookup name></mno.><br>
WO 2005/057961		PCT/US2004/040432<br><br>
query a DNS server (not shown in the figure) and obtains a list of available GGSNs that<br>
can be used to support the requested APN. A Domain Name Server maintains a<br>
database for resolving host names and IP addresses. Network devices query the DNS<br>
server by specifying a remote computers host name and receives in return, the hosts IP<br>
addresses.<br>
[0064}	The APN's Network ID indicates a CDMA2000 operator, thus, the DNS server<br>
returns with the EOF's IP address. (Step 3) The Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN)<br>
sends the Activate PDP Context Request to the selected IIF to set up a PDP context for<br>
the MS.   The message includes the APN, but the Requested PDP Address can be<br>
omitted. (Step 4) The IBF acts as the Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) and sends<br>
the Create PDP Context Response to the Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) that in<br>
turn sends the Activate PDP Context Accept to the MS.   The PDP Address in both<br>
messages can be set to 0.0.0.0 to indicate that the PDP address will be assigned later<br>
after successful Mobile IP registration. (Step 5) The IIF acts as the FA and sends one<br>
or more Mobile IP Agent Advertisements to the MS, because the omission of the<br>
Requested PDP Address in the Activate PDP Context Request can be the indication that<br>
the MS wishes to use Mobile IP.   The Agent Advertisement can be sent over tbe<br>
established PDP context.  The Agent Advertisement contains the FA Care-of Address<br>
and the FA Challenge (FAQ. (Step 6)<br>
[0065]	The MS sends the Mobile IP Registration Request to the IIF over the PDP<br>
context. The following information can be contained in the Registration Request: MS's NAI  [RFC 2794]  has  the  format  of <usermame>@<domain_name>, where the domainname identifies the MS's home CDMA2000 system. MS-HA authenticator can be computed based on the content of the Registration Request and the secret shared between the MS and HA [RFC 2002]. MS-AAA authenticator can be computed based on the FAC and the secret shared between the MS and home AAA server [RFC 3012]. The HA Address field can be set to a known value if the MS uses a permanent HA, or to 0.0.0.0 if the MS wants a new HA assigned by the home network. Home Address field can be set to a known value if the MS uses a permanent address, or to 0.0.0.0 if the MS wants a new address assigned by the HA.   The T-bit can be set to one to enable a reverse tunnel from the IIF to the MS's HA. (Step 7) The IIF acts as the RADIUS client and sends a RADIUS Access-Request to the home AAA server. The RADIUS Access-Request conveys MS's NAI, FAC authenticator, FAC, HA address, etc. [IS-835]. (Step<br><br>
WO 2005/057961		PCT/US2004/040432<br>
8) If the authentication is successful, the home AAA server responds with the RADIUS<br>
Access-Accept that includes the MS's HA address.     (Step 9) The IIF acts as the FA<br>
and forwards the Mobile IP Registration Request to the HA address contained in the<br>
RADIUS Access-Accept  (Step 10) The HA verifies the MS-HA authenticator in the<br>
Mobile IP Registration Request. If the HA doesn't have the shared secret, as in the case<br>
of dynamically assigned HA, it communicates with the home AAA server for the shared<br>
secret   The HA responds to the Mobile IP Registration Request with the Mobile IP<br>
Registration Reply containing a registration result (e.g., successful or an error code). If<br>
the MS wishes for a new home address, a new address can be returned in the<br>
Registration Reply; otherwise, the MS's permanent address can be returned. (Step 11)<br>
The IIF acts as the FA and forwards the Mobile IP Registration Reply to the MS over<br>
the appropriate PDP context. The EOF FA functionality notes the assigned MS IP address<br>
and  shares mat address with  the IIF Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN)<br>
functionality. (Step 12)<br>
[0066)	The IIF acts as the Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) and updates its PDP<br>
context by setting the PDP address to the MS's home address (as indicated in the Registration Reply and shared by the FA functionality). The PDP address (hence the MS's home address) can be associated with a GTP tunnel identified by the Tunnel Endpoint ID (TEID).   (Step 13)   The DDF acts as the Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) and triggers the GGSN-initiated PDP Context modification procedure in order to update the PDP address in the Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) and MS [3GPP TS 29.061].   The IIF sends the Update PDP Context Request to the Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) that forwards it to the MS. (Step 14) The MS responds with the Update PDP Context Response to the Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) that forwards it to the HF.  (Step 15)  The IB? acts as the RADBJS client and sends the RADIUS Accounting-Request (Start) to the home AAA server [IS-835].    3GPP2-vendor-specific attributes are used to convey accounting records, but some airlink record attributes (e.g., service option, mux option, etc.) are not applicable.  (Step 16) The home AAA server responds with a RADRJS Accounting-Response (Start).  (Step 17) Bearer traffic traverses through the HF in both directions, if reverse tunneling from the ID? to HA is enabled.  For routing MS-originated packets, the HF routes packets received from the MS's GTP tunnel (identified by a TEID) to the MS's HA via a Mobile B? reverse tunnel.  For routing MS-terminated packets, the HF routes packets<br><br>
WO 2005/057961		PCT/US2004/040432<br>
received from the HA-to-FA tunnel to the MS's GTP tunnel. IPsec can be used to protect the Mobile IP tunnels between HA and IIF, and the GTP tunnels between EOF and SGSN. (Step 18)<br>
GPRS Foreign Mode with Simple IP<br>
[0067J	FIG. 3A is an exemplary block diagram of a GPRS foreign mode with Simple IP<br>
that shows a roaming scenario where a CDMA2000 packet data native subscriber operates IPv4 or IPv6 in the GPRS foreign mode. FIG. 3A also depicts the functions and control interface provided by an interface or IIF in this case. In this embodiment, the home system 10 can be a CDMA 2000 packet data system wherein a CDMA 2000 packet data native subscriber roams to a GPRS system and uses Simple IP. The home system 10 comprises a ANSI-41 home location register 131, an AAA entity 116, and a LNS 139. The visited system 20 can be a GPRS system that comprises a Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) 137.<br>
(0068)	The interface 30 or "IIF" comprises an ANSI-41 visited location register 111<br>
coupled to the ANSI-41 home location register 131 via a D interface 113, a GSM home location register 124 coupled to the Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) 137 via a Gr interface 123, a Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) 126 coupled to the Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) 137 via a Gp interface 127 and coupled to the Internet via a Gi interface, an AAA entity 140 coupled to the AAA entity 116 via an X3 interface 117, and a LAC entity 109 coupled to the LNS 139 via an X2 interface 119. The ID? provides both GSM HLR and ANSI-41 VLR emulation to allow the subscriber to register. This interworking can be provided over the interface references "Gr" and "D." The HF provides Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) and LAC emulation to support bearer connectivity between the visited and home networks via the HF.    This intervvorking can be provided over the interface references "Gn" and "X2." The Link Access Control sublayer is the upper sublayer of Layer 2, and provides a mechanism for the correct transport and delivery of signaling messages which have been generated at Layer 3.<br>
10069]	The HF also provides AAA emulation to interact with the home network's AAA<br>
for L2TP authentication and 3GPP2 packet data accounting. This interworking can be provided over the interface reference "X3." The L2TP uses features of PPTP (Point to Point Tunneling Protocol) and L2F (Layer 2 Forwarding).    It has the ability to<br><br>
WO 2005/057961		PCT/IJS2004/040432<br>
49-<br>
encapsulate PPP frames so they can be sent over IP, X.25, Frame Relay, or ATM<br>
(Asynchronous Transfer Mode) networks. When using L2TP on an IP based network,<br>
the IP datagram supporting the L2TP payload employs the services of UDP (User<br>
Datagram Protocol).<br>
(0070]	If bearer connectivity between the CDMA2000 packet data system and GPRS<br>
system is not required, then the X2 interface is not required. The IIF still supports a Gp<br>
interface to the Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) and provides Internet access via a<br>
Gi interface (not shown in the figure).<br>
[0071]	Thus, for a user homed in a CDMA Simple IP system roaming to a GSM<br>
system, the IIF may present a Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) interface to GSM<br>
and a normal routing interface to the CDMA system. The IIF may serve as the endpoint<br>
for the GTP and IPSec tunnels, with a packet routing function between the Gateway<br>
GPRS Support Node (GGSN) and the CDMA system. The IIF may also provide an<br>
accounting function so that operators can charge based on configurable measurements<br>
such as packet count, bandwidth, time of day, etc.<br>
[0072)	FIG. 3B is an exemplary call flow diagram that shows Simple IP operation in the<br>
GPRS foreign mode, and explains a roaming scenario where a CDMA2000 packet data<br>
native subscriber operates Simple IP in the GPRS foreign mode. In this example, the<br>
MS has shared secrets with the home CDMA2000 system for Simple IP authentication<br>
(i.e., CHAP). The MS establishes a PPP session, via L2TP, to the home CDMA2000<br>
system. During the PPP establishment, the home CDMA2000 system assigns an IP<br>
address to the MS dynamically. All the MS's data traffic (MS-originated and - MS<br>
terminated) traverses through the IIF and home CDMA2000 system. The IIF generates<br>
3GPP2 packet data accounting records and sends it to the home CDMA2000 system via<br>
RADIUS.<br>
[0073]	The MS performs GPRS attach with a SGSN.   The authentication associated<br>
with the GPRS attach can be a SIM-based authentication requiring the Ki secret. The IIF acts as the GSM HLR configured with the Ki secret or the GSM VLR In any case, the IIF can be not required to communicate with the HLR in the home CDMA2000 system for the authentication. (Step 1) The MS sends the Activate PDP Context Request to the SGSN. The message includes the APN (Access Point Name). The APN has the format <network ld>.<mno. the network id cdma2000carrier.com indicates to which external ms wants establish></mno.><br>
WO 2005/057961		PCT/US2004/040432<br>
a logical connection. The Requested PDP Address can be omitted in the message so<br>
that the HF (acting as a GGSN) later will not assign an IP address to the MS; instead,<br>
the address will be assigned by the LNS. (Step 2) The Serving GPRS Support Node<br>
(SGSN) selects a Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) based on the APN. The<br>
Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) queries a DNS server (not shown in the figure)<br>
and obtains a list of available GGSNs that can be used to support file requested APN. In<br>
this case, the APN's Network ID indicates a CDMA2000 operator, thus, the DNS server<br>
returns with the HF's IP address. (Step 3)<br>
100741	The Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) sends the Activate PDP Context<br>
Request to the selected HF to set up a PDP context for the MS. The message includes<br>
the APN, but the Requested PDP Address can be omitted. (Step 4) The IIF acts as the<br>
Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) and sends the Create PDP Context Response to<br>
the Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) that in turn sends the Activate PDP Context<br>
Accept to the MS. The PDP Address in both messages can be set to 0.0.0.0 to indicate<br>
that the PDP address will be reset later. (Step 5)<br>
[0075J	After the PDP context can be established, the MS and HF perform PPP LCP<br>
negotiation. The HF LAC functionality establishes L2TP tunnels with a LNS. TheHF<br>
determines which LNS based on the requested APN.  The IIF is configured with the<br>
LNS information (e.g., LNS's IP address) corresponding to an APN. After the L2TP<br>
tunnel establishment, the HF LAC functionality forwards LCP information between the<br>
LNS and MS. During the LCP negotiation, the LNS and MS negotiate PAP or CHAP<br>
as the protocol for PPP authentication. (Step 6) PPP authentication (PAP or CHAP) is<br>
performed. The MS's credential is authenticated by the home AAA in the CDMA2000<br>
system. The RADIUS interaction between the LNS and home AAA is not shown in the<br>
figure.   (Step 7)   The LNS and MS perform PPP IPCP negotiation.   The HF LAC<br>
functionality relays IPCP messages between the L2TP tunnel and PDP context. During<br>
the negotiation, the LNS assigns an IP address to the MS.  The BF monitors for this<br>
address and uses it as the MS's PDP address. (Step 8)<br>
(0076]	The IIF also needs to notify the Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) and MS<br>
about the updated PDP address. Recall that the PDP address can be set to 0.0.0.0 initially. Therefore, the HF sends the Update PDP Context Request to the Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) that forwards it to the MS.  (Step 9) The MS responds<br><br>
WO 2«H)5/I&gt;579f&gt;l		PCT/US2W)4/040432<br>
with the Update PDP Context Response to the Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN)<br>
that forwards it to the IIF. (Step 10)<br>
[0077]	The IIF acts as the RADIUS client and sends the RADIUS Accounting-Request<br>
(Start) to the home AAA server [IS-835]. 3GPP2-vendor-specific attributes are used to convey accounting records, but some airlink record attributes (e.g., service option, mux option, etc.) are not applicable. (Step 11) The home AAA server responds with the RADIUS Accounting-Response (Start). (Step 12) Bearer traffic traverses through the HF in both directions. For routing MS-originated packets, the IIF routes packets received from the MS's GTP tunnel (identified by a TEID) to the MS's L2TP tunnel/session. For routing MS-terminated packets, the HF routes packets received from the MS's L2TP tunnel/session to the MS's GTP tunnel. IPsec can be used to protect the L2TP tunnel/session between LNS and IIF, and the GTP tunnels between IIF and SGSN. (Step 13)<br>
CDMA2000 Packet Data Foreign Mode with Mobile IPv4<br>
[0078J	FIG. 4A is an exemplary block diagram of a CDMA2000 packet data foreign<br>
mode with Mobile IPv4. This section describes the roaming scenario where a GPRS<br>
native subscriber operates Mobile IPv4 [IS-835-C] in the CDMA2000 packet data<br>
foreign mode. FIG. 4A also depicts the functions and control interface provided by the<br>
IIF in mis case. In this embodiment, the home system 10 can be a GPRS system. A<br>
GPRS native subscriber roams to a CDMA 2000 packet data system and uses Simple IP.<br>
The home system 10 comprises a GSM home location register 124, a Gateway GPRS<br>
Support Node (GGSN) 126, and an AAA entity 128. The visited system 20 can be a<br>
CDMA 2000 packet data system that comprises a ANSI-41 visited location register 111,<br>
an AAA entity 116, and a packet data serving node/ foreign agent 118.<br>
[0079J	The interface 30 or "IIF" comprises an ANSI-41 home location register 131<br>
coupled to the ANSI-41 visited location register 111 via a D interface 113, a GSM visited location register 133 coupled to the GSM home location register 124 via a D interface 121, a Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) 137 coupled to the Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) 126 via a Gp interface 127, an AAA entity 140 coupled to the AAA entity 128 via a X4 interface 129 and coupled to the AAA entity 116 via a X3 interface 117, and a home agent 135 coupled to the packet data serving node/ foreign agent 118 via aXl interface 115. The IIF provides both GSM VLR and ANSI-41 HLR<br><br>
WO 2005/057961	2J	PCT/US2004/040432<br>
emulation to allow the subscriber to register. This interworking can be provided over<br>
the interface reference "D." The IIF provides HA and Serving GPRS Support Node<br>
(SGSN) emulation to support bearer connectivity between the visited and home<br>
networks via the HF. This interworking can be provided over the interface reference<br>
"XI" and "Gn.M The IIF provides AAA emulation to interact with the visited network's<br>
AAA for Mobile IP authentication and 3GPP2 packet data accounting. The HF also<br>
may interact with the home network's AAA for 3GPP packet data accounting. This<br>
interworking can be provided over the interface reference "X3" and "X4." The<br>
IIF/AAA requirements for CDMA2000 packet data foreign mode with mobile IP will be<br>
described below in greater detail.<br>
[0080]	If bearer connectivity between the visited CDMA2000 packet data system and<br>
home GPRS system is not required, the Gp interface is not required. In this case,<br>
mobile-originated data traffic can be routed directly to the Internet via the Packet Data<br>
Serving Node (PDSN)/FA in the visited system, or via the DDF/HA if reverse tunneling is<br>
enabled. Mobile-terminated data traffic is routed to the Packet Data Serving Node<br>
(PDSN)/FA via the EOF/HA. The interface X3 and X4 are required for the IIF to<br>
interwork AAA messages between the CDMA2000 AAA server and GPRS AAA<br>
server.<br>
[0081)	Thus, for a user homed in a GSM system roaming to a CDMA Mobile IP<br>
system, the IIF may present a HA interface to the CDMA system and a Serving GPRS<br>
Support Node (SGSN) interface to the GSM system. A subset of Serving GPRS<br>
Support Node (SGSN) functions is required including APN resolution. The IIF may<br>
serve as the endpoint for the Mobile IP and GTP tunnels, with a packet routing function<br>
between the HA and Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) functions.<br>
[0082]	FIG. 4B is an exemplary call flow diagram that shows Mobile IPv4 operation in<br>
the CDMA2000 packet data foreign mode. This call flow example shows a roaming scenario where a GPRS native subscriber operates Mobile IPv4 [IS-835-C] in the CDMA2000 packet data foreign mode. In this example, the home GPRS system doesn't support HA; thus, the MS has shared secrets with the IIF for Mobile IP authentication. The home GPRS system dynamically assigns an IP address to the MS. All MS's data traffic (MS-originated and MS-terminated) traverses through the IIF and home GPRS system.   The EOF receives 3GPP2 accounting records from the visited<br><br>

J0083]	The MS originates SO 33 and establishes a PPP session with the Packet Data<br>
Serving Node (PDSN)/FA. (Step 1) The Packet Data Serving Node (PDSN)/FA sends<br>
one or more Mobile IP Agent Advertisements to the MS, because the omission of the<br>
IP-Address Configuration Option during the PPP IPCP negotiation indicates that the<br>
MS wishes to use Mobile IP. The Agent Advertisement contains the FA Care-of<br>
Address and the FA Challenge (FAC). (Step 2)<br>
|0084]	The MS sends the Mobile IP Registration Request to the Packet Data Serving<br>
Node (PDSN)/FA.   The following information can be contained in the Registration<br>
Request:   MS's NAI [RFC 2794] has the format of <username>@<domain_name>,<br>
where the domain name identifies the MS's home GPRS system. MS-HA authenticator<br>
can be computed based on the content of the Registration Request and the secret shared<br>
between the MS and HA [RFC 2002]. MS-AAA authenticator can be computed based<br>
on the FAC and the secret shared between the MS and home AAA server [RFC 3012].<br>
The HA Address field can be set to a known value if the MS uses a permanent HA, or to<br>
0.0.0.0 if the MS wants a new HA assigned by the home network. The HA field can be<br>
set to 0.0.0.0 to request a new address assigned by the HA. The T-bit can be set to one<br>
to request the Packet Data Serving Node (PDSN)/FA to establish a reverse tunnel to the<br>
MS's HA. (Step 3)<br>
I008S]	The Packet Data Serving Node (PDSN)/FA generates a RADRJS Access-<br>
Request conveying MS's NAI, FAC authenticator, FAC, HA address, etc. [IS-835]. Because the domain name of the MS's NAI indicates a GPRS system, the Packet Data Serving Node (PDSN)/FA sends a RADIUS Access-Request to the EOF via the AAA in the CDMA2000 system. The DF may modify the message in accordance with [3GPP TS 29.061]. (Step 4) If the authentication is successfull, the home AAA server responds with the RADPJS Access-Accept. The message is routed back to the Packet Data Serving Node (PDSN) via HF and visited AAA. The HF may modify the message in accordance with [P.S0001-A V3.0]. (Step 5) The Packet Data Serving Node (PDSN)/FA forwards the Mobile IP Registration Request to the HA function in the KF. The EOF verifies the MS-HA authenticator in the Mobile IP Registration Request. (Step 6)<br><br>

functionality establishes GTP tunnels with a Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) in<br>
the home GPRS system and can request an IP address from the GGSN. The HF Serving<br>
GPRS Support Node (SGSN) functionality derives an APN that has the format<br><network ro>.mnc<mnc>.mcc<mcc>.gpTS [TS 23.003].  The <network h is the></network>

are derived from the MS's IMSL   The MS's NAI and IMSI are available from the<br>
RADIUS Access-Request in step 4.    The Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN)<br>
functionality uses the derived APN as the lookup name to query GPRS DNS server (not<br>
shown in the figure) and from it obtains a fist of available GGSNs that can be used to<br>
support the requested  service.     The IB?  Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN)<br>
functionality sends the Create PDP Context Request to the selected GGSN.    The<br>
Requested PDP Address in the message is set to 0.0.0.0 to request a new IP address.<br>
(Step 7)  The Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) responds with the Create PDP<br>
Context Response including the new IP address assigned to the MS. (Step 8) The IIF<br>
acts as the HA and sends the Mobile IP Registration Reply to the MS via the Packet<br>
Data Serving Node (PDSN)/FA. The Home Address field in the Mobile IP Registration<br>
Reply can be set to the IP address assigned by the GGSN. (Step 9) The Packet Data<br>
Serving Node (PDSN) sends the RADIUS Accounting-Request (Start) containing<br>
3GPP2 packet data accounting information [P.S0001-A V3.0].   Because the domain<br>
name of the MS's NAI indicates a GPRS system, the RADIUS Accounting-Request<br>
(Start) is routed to the home AAA in the GPRS system via the visited AAA and IDF.<br>
The IB? may modify the message in accordance with [3GPP TS 29.061]. (Step 10) The<br>
HF acts as the RADIUS server and replies with the RADRJS Accounting-Response<br>
(Start). (Step 11)<br>
[0087]	Bearer traffic traverses through the HF in both directions.   For routing MS-<br>
origmated packets, the ID? routes packets received from the Mobile IP reverse tunnel to the MS's GTP tunnel (identified by a TEID). For routing MS-terrninated packets, the ID? routes packets received from the GTP tunnel to a HA-to-FA tunnel. IPsec can be used to protect the Mobile IP tunnels between Packet Data Serving Node (PDSN)/FA and HF, and the GTP tunnels between HF and GGSN. (Step 12)<br><br>

[0088]	The IIF requirements to process the RADRJS Access-Request received from the<br>
visited CDMA2000 packet data system will now be described.<br>
[0089]	The IEF proxies all IETF RADIUS attributes without modification, except the<br>
Calling-Station-ID attribute, Called-Station-ID attribute, and Framed-Protocol attribute.<br>
The processing of these three attributes is described below.   If the Calling-Station-ID<br>
attribute in the received RADIUS Access-Request contains IMSI, the IEF copies the<br>
IMSI into the 3GPP-IMSI attribute [3GPP TS 29.061] and include it in the RADIUS<br>
Access-Request destined for the MS's home GPRS system. The HF does not include<br>
the Calling-Station-ID attribute in the RADIUS Access-Request sent to the home AAA<br>
in the GPRS system.   If the Calling-Station-ID attribute in the received RADIUS<br>
Access-Request contains MTN or KM, the ID? maps it to the MS's IMSI used in the<br>
home GPRS system and include it in the 3GPP-1MSI attribute of the RADRJS Access-<br>

CDMA2000 Packet Data Foreign Mode with Simple IP<br>
[0096)	FIG. SA is an exemplary block: diagram of a CDMA2000 packet data foreign<br>
mode with Simple IP. This section describes the roaming scenario where a GPRS<br>
native subscriber operates IPv4 or IPv6 in the CDMA2000 packet data foreign mode.<br>
FIG. 5A also depicts the functions and control interface provided by the interface 30 or<br>
"EOF" in this case, m this embodiment, the home system 10 can be a GPRS system<br>
wherein a GPRS native subscriber roams to a CDMA 2000 packet data system and uses<br>
Mobile IPv4. The home system 10 comprises a GSM home location register 124, a<br>
Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) 126, and an AAA entity 128. The visited<br>
system 20 can be a CDMA 2000 packet data system that comprises a ANSI-41 visited<br>
location register 111, an AAA entity 116, and a home system 109.<br>

interface 117, and a LCS entity 139 coupled to the packet data serving node/ LAC entity 109 via an X2 interface 119. The IIF provides both GSM VLR and ANSI-41 HLR emulation to allow the subscriber to register. This interworking can be provided over the interface reference "D." The IIF provides LNS and Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) emulation to support bearer connectivity between the visited and home networks via the IIF. This interworking can be provided over the interface reference "X2" and "Gn." The IIF provides AAA emulation to interact with the visited network's AAA for L2TP authentication and 3GPP2 packet data accounting. The IIF also may interact with the home network's AAA for 3GPP packet data accounting. This interworking can be provided over the interface reference "X3" and "X4." The IIF/AAA requirements for CDMA2000 packet data foreign mode with Simple IP will be described below in greater detail.<br>
[0098]	If bearer connectivity between the visited CDMA2000 packet data system and<br>
home GPRS system is not required, the X2 and Gp interface are not required. In this case, both mobile-originated and mobile-terminated data traffic is routed to/from the Internet via the Packet Data Serving Node (PDSN) in the visited system. The interface X3 and X4 are required for the HF to interwork AAA messages between the CDMA2000 AAA server and GPRS AAA server.<br>
(0099]	Thus, for a user homed in a GSM system roaming to a CDMA Simple IP<br>
system, the IIF may present a L2TP Network Server (LNS) interface to the CDMA system and a Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) interface to the GSM system. A subset of Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) functions is required including APN resolution. The DF may serve as the endpoint for the Mobile L2TP and GTP tunnels, with a packet routing function between the LNS and Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) functions.<br>
[00100]	FIG. 5B is an exemplary call flow diagram that shows Simple IP operation in the<br>
CDMA2000 packet data foreign mode. This call flow example illustrates a roaming scenario where a GPRS native subscriber operates Simple IP in the CDMA2000 packet data foreign mode. In this example, the MS has shared secrets with the home AAA in the GPRS system for CHAP authentication. The home GPRS system dynamically assigns an IP address to the MS. All MS's data traffic (MS-originated and mobile-tenninated) traverses through the IIF and home GPRS system. The DF receives 3GPP2<br><br>

	accounting records from the visited  CDMA2000  system  and maps it to 3GPP<br>
accounting records and forward it to the home GPRS system via RADIUS.<br>
[00101]	The MS originates SO 33 and initiates PPP LCP negotiation with the Packet<br>
	Data Serving Node (PDSN)/LAC.   CHAP can be negotiated as the protocol for PPP authentication.   (Step 1)   Packet Data Serving Node (PDSN)/LAC sends a CHAPchallenge to the MS. (Step 2) The MS replies with its NAI and a challenge response computed based on the challenge and the secret shared with the home AAA in theGPRS system. The Packet Data Serving Node (PDSN)/LAC sends RADIUS Access-Request  Because the domain name of the MS's NAI indicates a GPRS system, theRADIUS Access-Request can be routed through the visited AAA and OF that proxies the message to the home AAA in the GPRS system. The HF may modify the message in accordance with [3GPP TS 29.061]. (Step 3)   If the authentication is successful, the home AAA responds with the RADIUS Access-Accept   The message can be routed back to the Packet Data Servmg Node (PDSN)/LAC via the IIF and visited AAA. The IIF inserts the Tunnel-Server-Endpoint attribute in the RADIUS Access-Accept This attribute informs the Packet Data Serving Node (PDSN)/LAC to establish a L2TP tunnel with the OF that acts as the LNS.   The Packet Data Serving Node (PDSN)/LAC sends the CHAP Success to inform the MS about the successful authentication. (Step 4) <br>
(00102)	The Packet Data Serving Node (PDSN)/LAC establishes a L2TP tunnel/session<br>
with the HF that acts as the LNS. During the L2TP tunnel/session establishment, the Packet Data Serving Node (PDSN)/LAC forwards the LCP information (exchanged between the MS and Packet Data Serving Node (PDSN)/LAC) to the HF. The HF LNS functionality may initiate CHAP challenge (not shown in the figure) to authenticate the MS before IPCP negotiation. (Step 5) The HF Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) functionality establishes GTP tunnels with a Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) in the home GPRS system and can request an IP address from the GGSN. The IIF derives an APN that has the format <network id>mnc<mnc>mcc<mcc>.gprs.  The <network id> is the realm portion of the MS's NAI and is used to indicate which Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) the MS wants to access for the requested service.

GGSNs that can be used to support the requested service. The IIF Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) functionality sends the Create PDP Context Request to the selected GGSN. The Requested PDP Address in the message is set to 0.0.0.0 to request a new IP address. (Step 6) The Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) responds with the Create PDP Context Response including the new IP address assigned to the MS. (Step 7)<br>
[00103]	This new IP address can be assigned to the MS during the PPP IPCP negotiation<br>
between the IIF and MS. (Step 8) The Packet Data Serving Node (PDSN)/FA sends the RADIUS Accounting-Request (Start) containing 3GPP2 packet data accounting information [IS-835]. The Packet Data Serving Node (PDSN) sends the RADIUS Accounting-Request (Start) containing 3GPP2 packet data accounting information [P.S0001-A V3.0]. Because the domain name of the MS's NAI indicates a GPRS system, the RADRJS Accounting-Request (Start) is routed to the home AAA in the GPRS system via the visited AAA and DF. The IIF may modify the message in accordance with [3GPP TS 29.061]. (Step 9) The home AAA replies with the RADIUS Accounting-Response (Start) that is routed back to the Packet Data Serving Node (PDSN) via IIF and visited AAA. (Step 10)<br>
(00104)	Bearer traffic traverses through the IIF in both directions.   For routing MS-<br>
originated packets, the IIF routes packets received from the MS's L2TP tunnel/session to the MS's GTP tunnel (identified by a TEID). For routing MS-terminated packets, the IIF routes packets received from the MS's GTP tunnel to the MS's L2TP tunnel/session. IPsec can be used to protect the L2TP tunnel/session between Packet Data Serving Node (PDSN)/LAC and IIF, and fee GTP tunnels between HF and GGSN. (Step 11)<br>
