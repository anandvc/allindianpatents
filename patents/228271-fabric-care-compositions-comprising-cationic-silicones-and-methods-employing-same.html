Provisional Application Serial Nos. 60/228,170, filed August 28,2000 (Attorney Docket No.8225P), 60/243,825, filed October 27, 2000 (Attorney Docket No.8225P2), 60/249,059, filed November 15,2000 (Attorney Docket No.8225P3), and 60/268,174, filed February 12,2001 (Attorney Docket No.8225P4).<br>
Field of the Invention <br>
This invention relates to systems, compositions and methods for domestic laundering comprising selected cationic silicones formulated for improved fabric care.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
When consumers launder fabrics, they desire excellence in cleaning, but also seek superior fabric care or garment care. Such care can be exemplified by one or more of: superior garment appearance; excellent tactile characteristics, such as fabric feel; fabric softness; reduction, removal or prevention of creases or wrinkles in garments; superior ease of ironing; garment shape retention and/or shape recovery; and fabric elasticity.<br>
In home laundering, there exist unique and significant challenges for securing fabric care, especially when compared to industrial textile finishing.<br>
In spite of the advances in the art, there remains a need for improved fabric care, especially in home laundering. In particular, there remain important unsolved problems with respect to selecting cationic silicones and other adjuncts so that the combination provides uncompromised levels of fabric care. When the composition is a laundry detergent, it remains particularly difficult to combine detergent adjuncts and selected cationic silicones in such a way as to secure superior fabric care at the same time as outstanding cleaning and formulation stability or flexibility.<br>
Accordingly, objects of the present invention include to solve the hereinabove mentioned technical problems and to provide systems, compositions and methods having specifically selected cationic silicones and other adjuncts that secure superior fabric care.<br>
Summary of the Invention <br>
The present invention solves the above-identified technical problems. Specifically, the objects herein are secured and compositions, systems and methods are provided which deliver superior fabric care in home laundering.<br>
An essential component of the invention is the selection of specific cationic silicones, identified in detail hereinafter, which have the potential to deliver superior fabric care in home laundering.<br>
No less important in the present invention is the successful incorporation of the selected silicones in compositions, systems and methods for home fabric care.<br>
The present invention has numerous advantages, including, according to the specific embodiment, one or more aspects of superior fabric care or garment care as exemplified by one or more of: superior garment appearance; excellent tactile characteristics, superior fabric feel; fabric softness; reduction, removal or prevention of creases or wrinkles in garments; superior ease of ironing; garment shape retention and/or shape recovery; and fabric elasticity. Moreover the invention has other advantages, depending on the precise embodiment, which include superior formulation flexibility and/or formulation stability of the home laundry compositions provided.<br>
The invention includes other ramifications, such as processes or methods for securing the compositions, and products in a wide range of forms and types, such as unitary liquid laundry detergents as well as multi-compartment formulations for mixing at the point of use.<br>
The present invention includes surprising discoveries, for example it has surprisingly been found that, given proper attention both to the selection of the cationic silicone and to the formulation adjuncts, unexpectedly good fabric care and/or consumer acceptance of the home laundry product can be obtained, possibly relating to the interplay of multiple fabric care benefits, or to the combination of fabric care and other aesthetic benefits, for example enhanced deposition of otherwise known perfumery materials. Moreover, superior fabric care or garment care benefits in home laundering as discovered in the present invention can unexpectedly include benefits when the products herein are used in different modes, such as treatment before washing in an automatic washing machine (pretreatment benefits), through-the wash benefits, and post-treatment benefits, including benefits secured when the inventive products are used in the rinse or in fabric or garment spin-out or drying in, or outside an appliance. Additionally discovered are regimen benefits, i.e., benefits of converting from use of a product system comprising conventional<br>

Uses of Compositions of the Invention in Relation to Form - As used herein, "fabric care compositions" include fabric care compositions for handwash, machine wash and other purposes including fabric care additive compositions and compositions suitable for use in the soaking and/or pretreatment of stained fabrics.<br>
Even though fabric care compositions are specifically discussed herein, compositions comprising the cationic silicones of the present invention for use in treating, cleaning, conditioning, and/or refreshing both natural and synthetic fibers are encompassed by the present invention.<br>
Perfume compositions - The present compositions include perfume compositions of the present invention which comprise a fabric substantive perfume as defined in full hereinafter and a cationic silicone polymer as taught for use in the present laundry or fabric care compositions.<br>
The perfume compositions of the present invention are preferably incorporated into the fabric care compositions of the present invention. For example, the perfume compositions of the present invention may be premixed prior to adding to the fabric care compositions of the present invention.<br>
The level of perfume composition in the fabric care composition is typically from about 0.0001% to about 2% or higher, e.g., to about 10%; preferably from about 0.0002% to about 0.8%, more preferably from about 0.003% to about 0.6%, most preferably from about 0.005% to about 0.5% by weight of the fabric care composition.<br>
The level of fabric substantive perfume ingredients in the perfume compositions of the present invention is typically from about 0.0001% (more preferably 0.01%) to about 99%, preferably from about 0.01% to about 50%, more preferably from about 0.2% to about 30%, even more preferably from about 1% to about 20%, most preferably from about 2% to about 10% by weight of the composition of me perfume composition.<br>
Cationic silicone - The cationic silicone polymer selected for use in the present invention compositions comprises one or more polysiloxane unite, preferably polydimethylsiloxane units of formula -{(CH3)2SiO}n - having a degree of polymerization, n, of from 50 to 200 and organosilicon-free unite comprising at least one diquatemary unit. In preferred embodimente of the invention, the selected cationic silicone polymer has from 0.50 to 1.0 weight fraction of said organosilicon-free units selected from N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-l,6-hexanediammonium units.<br>
The selected cationic silicone polymer can also contain from 0.0 to 0.20 weight fraction, in certain embodiments a non-zero amount, of the total of organosilicon-free units of -NHCH(CH3)CH2O(AO)aCH2CH(CH3)NH- units wherein AO represents ethyleneoxy, propyleneoxy, butyleneoxy and mixtures thereof and a is from 5 to 70.<br>
The selected cationic silicone polymer can also contain from 0.0, in certain embodiments a non-zero amount to 0.20 weight fraction, of the total of organosilicon-free units of -NR3+ wherein R is alkyl, hydroxyalkyl or phenyl. These units can be thought of as end-caps.<br>
Moreover the selected cationic silicone polymer generally contains anions, selected from inorganic and organic anions, more preferably selected from saturated and unsaturated C1-C20 carboxylates and mixtures thereof, to balance the charge of the quaternary moieties, thus the cationic silicone polymer also comprises such anions in a quaternary charge-balancing proportion. Conceptually, the selected cationic silicone polymers herein can helpfully be thought of as non-crosslinked or "linear" block copolymers including non-fabric-substantive but surface energy<br>
modifying "loops" made up of the polysiloxane units, and fabric-substantive "hooks". One preferred class of the selected cationic polymers (illustrated by Structure 1 hereinafter) can be thought of as comprising a single loop and two hooks; another, very highly preferred, comprises two or more, preferably three or more "loops" and two or more, preferably three or more "hooks" (illustrated by Structures 2a and 2b hereinafter), and yet another (illustrated by Structure 3 hereinafter) comprises two "loops" pendant from a single "hook".<br>
Of particular interest in the present selection of cationic silicone polymers is that the "hooks" contain no silicon and that each "hook" comprises at least two quaternary nitrogen atoms.<br>
Also of interest in the present selection of preferred cationic silicone polymers is that the quaternary nitrogen is preferentially located in the "backbone" of the "linear" polymer, in contradistinction from alternate and less preferred structures in which the quaternary nitrogen is incorporated into a moiety or moieties which form a "pendant" or "dangling" structure off the "backbone".<br>
The structures are completed by terminal moieties which can be noncharged or, when charged, can comprise only one quaternary nitrogen atom, as in the moiety -NR3+ wherein R is alkyl. Moreover a certain proportion of nonquatemary silicone-free moieties can be present, for example the moiety -NHCH(CH3)CH2O(AO)aCH2CH(CH3)NH-described hereinabove.<br>
Of course the conceptual model presented is not intended to be limiting of other moieties, for example connector moieties, which can be present in the selected cationic silicone polymers provided that they do not substantially disrupt the intended function as fabric benefit agents.<br>

Preferred Fabric Care Adjuncts<br>
(a) Stabilizer - Compositions of the present invention may and preferably do include a stabilizer. Suitable levels of this component are in the range from about 0.01% to about 20%, more preferably from about 0.1% to about 10% by weight of the composition. The stabilizer serves to stabilize the cationic silicone in the inventive compositions and to prevent it from coagulating and/or creaming. This is especially important when the inventive compositions have fluid form, as in the case of perfume compositions, liquid or gel-form laundry detergents for heavy-duty or fine fabric wash use, and liquid or gel-form fabric treatments other than laundry detergents.<br>
Stabilizers suitable for use herein can be selected from thickening stabilizers. These include gums and other similar polysaccharides, for example gellan gum, carrageenan gum, and other known types of thickeners and rheological additives oilier than highly polyanionic types; thus conventional clays are not included.<br>
More preferably the stabilizer is a crystalline, hydroxyl-containing stabilizing agent, more preferably still, a frihydroxystearin, hydrogenated oil or a variation thereof.<br>
Without intending to be limited by theory, the crystalline, hydroxyl-containing stabilizing agent is a nonlimiting example of a "thread-like structuring system." 'Thread-like Structuring System" as used herein means a system comprising one or more agents that are capable of providing a chemical network that reduces the tendency of materials with which they are combined to coalesce and/or phase split Examples of the one or more agents include crystalline, hydroxyl-containing stabilizing agents and/or hydrogenated jojoba. Surfactants are not included within the definition of the thread-like structuring system. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the thread-like structuring system forms a fibrous or entangled threadlike network in-situ on cooling of the matrix. The thread-like structuring system has an average aspect ratio of from about 1.5:1, preferably from at least about 10:1, to about 200:1.<br>
The thread-like structuring system can be made to have a viscosity of about 2000 cps or less at an intermediate shear range (5 s-1 to 50 s-1) which allows for the pouring of the detergent out of a standard bottle, while the low shear viscosity of the product at 0.1 s-1 can be at least<br>
about 2000 cps but more preferably greater than about 20,000 cps.<br>
The thread-like structuring system of the present invention provides the liquid compositions of the present invention improved shelf and stress stability, but allows the liquid compositions to permit its benefit-providing agents to provide their benefits upon use. The specific system used is found to be compatible with the cationic silicones, whereas others, for example when comprised substantially of clays such as sodium montmorillonite, are not.<br>
The process for making the thread-like structuring system of the present invention suitably comprises heating a mixture of water and a crystalline, hydroxyl-containing stabilizing agent to above the melting point of the crystalline, hydroxyl-containing stabilizing agent, and then cooling the mixture while mixing continuously to room temperature such that a thread-like structuring system is formed.<br>
In one embodiment, the process comprises activating the crystalline, hydroxyl-containing stabilizing agent comprising the steps of:   1) combining the crystalline, hydroxyl-stabilizing agent, preferably from about 0.1% to about 5% by weight of the premix, with water, preferably at least about 20% by weight of the premix, and a surfactant and optionally, a salt, to form a premix; 2) heating the premix formed in Step 1) above the melting point of the crystalline, hydroxyl-containing stabilizing agent;   and 3) cooling the mixture formed in Step 2) while agitating the mixture to ambient temperature such that a thread-like structuring system is formed. The premix formed in Step 1) may further comprise a surfactant. The premix formed in Step 1) may further comprise an amine oxide. Further detail around this process of making the thread-like structuring system can be found in U.S. Patent No. 6,080,708, which is owned by The Procter and Gamble Company.<br>
The crystalline, hydroxyl-containing stabilizing agent typically is present in the liquid compositions of the present invention at a level of from about 0.1% to about 10%, more typically from about 0.1 % to about 3%, most typically from about 0.3% to about 2% by weight of the liquid composition.<br>
Crystalline, hydroxyl-containing stabilizing agents can be fatty acid, fatty ester or fatty soap water-insoluble wax-like substance.<br>
The crystalline, hydroxyl-containing stabilizing agents in accordance with, the present invention are preferably derivatives of castor oil, especially hydrogenated castor oil derivatives. For example, castor wax.<br>
The crystalline, hydroxyl-containing agent typically is selected from the group consisting of:<br>
i)	R1OCH2CH(OR2)CH2OR3 wherein R1 is -C(O)R4, R2 is R1 or H, R3 is Rl or H, and R4 is independently C10-C22 alkyl or alkenyl comprising at least one hydroxyl group; <br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
wherein: <br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>

(g) Scavenger agent - The compositions of the present invention may comprise at least about 0.001%, preferably from about 0.5% to about 10%, most preferably to about 5% by weight, of one or more scavenger agents. Scavenger agents suitable for use herein are selected from scavengers selected to capture fugitive dyes and/or anionic surfactants and/or soils.<br>
Preferred scavenger agents are selected from the group consisting of fixing agents for anionic dyes, complexing agents for anionic surfactants, clay soil control agents and mixtures thereof. These materials can be combined at any suitable ratio. Suitable compounds are included in commonly patents to Gosselink et al and are commercially available from BASF, Ciba and others.<br>
i) Fixing Agents for Anionic dyes- Dye fixing agents, "fixatives", or "fixing agents" are well-known, commercially available materials which are designed to improve the appearance of dyed fabrics by minimizing the loss of dye from fabrics due to washing. Not included within this definition are components which can in some embodiments serve as fabric softener actives.<br>
Many fixing agents for anionic dyes are cationic, and are based on quaternized nitrogen<br>
compounds OT on nitrogen compounds having a strong cationic charge which is formed in situ<br>
under the conditions of usage.<br>
Fixing  agents  are available  under  various  trade  names   from  several  suppliers.<br>
Representative examples include: CROSCOLOR PMF (July  1981,  Code No.  7894)  and<br>
CROSCOLOR NOFF (January 1988, Code No. 8544) ex Crosfield; INDOSOL E-50 (February<br>
27, 1984, Ref. No. 6008.35.84; polyethyleneimine-based) ex Sandoz; SANDOFIX TPS, ex<br>
Sandoz, is a preferred dye fixative for use herein.   Additional non-limiting examples include<br>
SANDOFIX SWE (a cationic resinous compound) ex Sandoz, REWIN SRF, REWIN SRF-0 and<br>
REWIN DWR ex CHT-Beitlich GMBH; Tinofixยฎ ECO, Tinofixยฎ FRD and Solfinยฎ ex Ciba-<br>
Geigy and described in WO 99/14301. Other preferred fixing agents for use in the compositions<br>
of the present invention are CARTAFIX CBยฎ ex Clariant and the cyclic amine based polymers,<br>
oligomers or copolymers described in WO 99/14300.<br>
Other fixing agents useful herein are described in "Aftertreatments for Improving the<br>
Fastness of Dyes on Textile Fibres", Christopher C. Cook, Rev. Prog. Coloration, Vol. XII,<br>
(1982).   Dye fixing agents suitable for use in the present invention are ammonium compounds<br>
such as fatty acid-diamine condensates, inter alia the hydrochloride, acetate, methosulphate and<br>
benzyl hydrochloride salts of diamine esters.    Non-limiting examples include oleyldiethyl<br>
aminoethylamide,   oleylmethyl   diethylenediamine   methosulphate,   and   monostearylethylene<br>
diaminotrimethyiammonium methosulphate. In addition, N-oxides other than surfactant-active N-<br>
oxides, more particularly polymeric N-oxides such as polyvinylpyridine N-oxide, are useful as fixing agents herein. Other useful fixing agents include derivatives of polymeric alkyldiamines, polyamine-cyanuric chloride condensates, and aminated glycerol dichlorohydrins.<br>
Fixing agents for anionic dyes can be used in the present methods either in the form of such agents fully integrated into the inventive compositions, or by including them in a laundry treatment method according to the invention in the form of a separate article, for example a substrate article or sheet, which can be added to the wash along with the cationic silicone containing composition. In this manner, the fixing agent can complement the use of the cationic silicone composition. Combinations of such dye fixing articles and compositions comprising the cationic silicones can be sold together in the form of a kit.<br>
ii) Scavenger agents for anionic surfactants and/or soils- Suitable scavenger agents for anionic surfactants and/or soils include alkoxylated polyalkyleneimines and/or quaternized derivatives thereof.<br>
(h) Fabric softeners - Fabric softeners, when present in the preferred compositions of the invention, are suitably at levels of up to about 30% by weight of the composition, more typically from about 1% to about 20%, preferably from about 2% to about 10% in certain embodiments. Suitable fabric softeners for use in the present invention include all the current commercial quaternary long-chain softeners, especially at least partially unsaturated esterquats with varying iodine value. Suitable fabric softeners more generally include fabric softening compounds which are cationic, water insoluble quaternary ammonium compounds comprising a polar head group and two long hydrocarbyl moieties, preferably selected from alkyl, alkenyl and mixtures thereof, wherein each such hydrocarbyl moiety has an average chain length equal to or greater than C12, preferably greater than C14, more preferably greater than C16, More preferably still, at least 50% of each long chain alkyl or alkenyl group is predominantly linear. A preferred overall chain length is about C18, though mixtures of chainlengths having non-zero proportions of lower, e.g., C14 C,6 and some higher, e.g., C20 chains can be quite desirable. The cationic softener can suitably be distearyl dimethyl ammonium chloride or unsaturated analogs thereof, but more preferably for the environment, the quaternary ammonium fabric softener is selected to be biodegradable. This property is present, for example, in the common commercial esterquat fabric softeners such as di(tallowyloxyethyl)dimethyl ammonium chloride.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the fabric softening compound is a quaternary ammonium esterquat compound having two CI2-22 alkyl or alkenyl groups connected to a quaternary ammonium moiety via at least one ester moiety, preferably two such ester moieties. A preferred esterquat ammonium fabric softener for use in the present compositions has the formula:<br>
{(R1)2N((CH2)ER2)2}X' wherein each R1 group is independently selected from C1-4 alkyl, hydroxyalkyl or C^ alkenyl; and wherein each R2 is independently selected from C8-28 alkyl or alkenyl groups; E is an ester moiety i.e., -OC(O)- or -C(O)O-, n is an integer from 0-5, and X' is a suitable anion, for example chloride, methosulfate and mixtures thereof.<br>
A second preferred type of quaternary ammonium material can be represented by the formula: {(RO3N(CHOnCH(O(O)CR2)CH2O(O)CR2(+X- wherein each R1 group is independently selected from C^ alkyl, hydroxyalkyl or C2-4 alkenyl; each R2 is independently selected from C8-28 alkyl or alkenyl groups; n is an integer from 0-5; and X" is a suitable anion, for example chloride, methosulfate and mixtures thereof. This latter class can be exemplified by 1,2 bis[hardened tallowoyloxy]-3-trimethyIammonium propane chloride.<br>
Esterquat fabric softeners as available in commerce include materials comprising varying proportions of monoester in addition to diester.<br>
Suitable fabric softeners herein include softening compounds having a solubility less than 1 x 10'3 wt%, more preferably less than 1 x 10-4 wt%, more preferably still, from 1 x 10-6 wt% to 1 x 10-8 wt%, in demineralised water at 20 degrees C.<br>
(i) Detersive enzyme - Suitable detersive enzymes for use herein include protease, amylase, cellulase, mannanase, endoglucanase, lipase and mixtures thereof. Enzymes can be used at their art-taught levels, for example at levels recommended by suppliers such as Novo and Genencor. Typical levels in the compositions are from about 0% to about 5%. When enzymes are present, they can be used at very low levels, e.g., from about 0.001% or lower, in certain embodiments of the invention; or they can be used in heavier-duty laundry detergent formulations in accordance with the invention at higher levels, e.g., about 0.1% and higher. In accordance with a preference of some consumers for "non-biological" detergents, the present invention includes both enzyme-containing and enzyme-free embodiments.<br>
(j) Chelant - Suitable chelants for use herein include nitrogen-containing, P-free<br>
aminocarboxylates such as EDDS, EDTA and DTPA; aminophosphonates such as<br>
diethylenetriamine	pentamethylenephosphonic	acid	and,	ethylenediamine<br>
tetramethylenephosphonic acid; nitrogen-free phosphonates e.g., HEDP; and nitrogen or oxygen containing, P-free carboxylate-free chelants such as compounds of the general class of certain macrocyclic N-ligands such as those known for use in bleach catalyst systems. Levels of cheiand are typically lower than about 5%, more typically, chelants, when present, are at levels of from about 0.01% to about 3%.<br>
(k) Solvent system - The solvent system in the present compositions can be anhydrous or hydrous; and can include water alone or mixtures of organic solvents with water. Preferred organic solvents include 1,2-propanediol, ethanol, glycerol and mixtures thereof. Other lower<br>
alcohols, C1-C4 alkanolamines such as monoethanolamine and triethanolamine, can also be used. Solvent systems can be absent, for example from anhydrous solid embodiments of the invention, but more typically are present at levels in the range of from about 0.1% to about 98%, preferably at least about 10% to about 95%, more usually from about 25% to about 75%. (I) Effervescent system - Effervescent systems suitable herein include those derived by combining an acid and a bicarbonate or carbonate, or by combining hydrogen peroxide and catalase, or any other combination of materials which release small bubbles of gas. The components of the effervescent system may be combinedly dispensable to form the effervescence when they are mixed, or can be formulated together provided that conventional coatings or protection systems are used. Levels of effervescent system can vary very widely, for example effervescent components together can range from about 0.1% to about 30% of the composition. Hydrogen peroxide and catalase are very mass efficient and can be at much lower levels with excellent results.<br>
(m) Coating or encapsulating agent - Any suitable coatings or encapsulating agents can be applied to all or a part of the present compositions. Suitable examples include polyvinylalcohol film or other suitable variations; carboxymethylcellulose, cellulose derivatives, starch, modified starch, sugars, PEG, waxes, or combinations thereof. Coatings can have one or a plurality of layers. The amount of coating material, for any material coated, can range from about 5% to about 50% by weight of the material to be coated or encapsulated.<br>
(n) Mixtures of adjuncts - Mixtures of the above components can be made in any proportion, (o) Other adjuncts - Examples of other suitable cleaning adjunct materials include, but are not limited to, fatty acids, alkoxylated benzoic acids or salts thereof such as trimethoxy benzoic acid or a salt thereof (TMBA), conventional (not fabric substantive) perfumes and pro-perfumes, anionic surfactants, including but not limited to linear alkylbenzene sulfonates, alkyl sulfates, alkyl ethoxysulfates and mixtures thereof, including also linear and branched (including mid-chain branched forms) of such surfactants, zwitterionic and/or amphoteric surfactants, bleaches, bleach activators, bleach catalysts, enzyme stabilizing systems, optical brighteners or fluorescers, soil   release  polymers,  dispersants   or polymeric  organic builders  including  water-soluble polyacrylates, acrylate / maleate copolymers and the like , suds suppressors, dyes, colorants, filler salts such as sodium sulfate, hydrorropes such as toluenesulfonates, cumenesulfonates and naphthalenesulfonates, photoactivators, hydrolyzable surfactants, preservatives, anti-oxidants, anti-shrinkage agents, anti-wrinkle agents, germicides, fungicides, color speckles, colored beads, spheres or extrudates, sunscreens, fluorinated compounds, clays, pearlescent agents, luminescent agents or chemiluminescent agents, anti-corrosion and/or appliance protectant agents, alkalinity sources or other pH adjusting agents, solubilizing agents, carriers, processing aids, pigments, free<br>
radical scavengers, and pH control agents. Suitable materials include those described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,705,464, 5,710,115,5,698,504, 5,695,679, 5,686,014 and 5,646,101. Incorporation of cationic silicones into compositions of the invention<br>
Incorporation of cationic silicones into compositions of the invention can be done in any suitable manner and can, in general, involve any order of mixing or addition. However, it has been discovered that there exist certain preferred ways to accomplish such incorporation.<br>
A first method involves introducing the cationic silicone polymer as received from the manufacturer directly into a preformed mixture of two or more of the other components of the final composition. This can be done at any point in the process of preparing the final composition, including at the very end of the formulating process.<br>
A second method involves premixing the cationic silicone polymer with one or more adjuncts of the final composition and adding this premix to a mixture of the remaining adjuncts.<br>
A preferred method more specifically has a step of mixing the cationic silicone polymer with an adjunct selected from the group consisting of cationic surfactants, cationic fabric softeners, amine surfactants, amine oxide surfactants, alkoxylated alcohols, fabric substantive perfume ingredients, and mixtures thereof, more preferably in the presence of a portion of the overall organic solvents to be used, followed by a step of combining the resulting cationic silicone polymer premix with one or more other adjuncts of the composition, water and the balance of the organic solvents, thereby forming the final composition.<br>
These methods of introducing the cationic silicone polymer into the final composition are preferably assisted by use of conventional high-shear mixing means. This ensures proper dispersion of the cationic silicone polymer throughout the final composition.<br>
Liquid compositions, especially liquid detergent compositions in accordance with the invention preferably comprise a stabilizer, especially preferred being trihydroxystearin or hydrogenated castor oil, for example the type commercially available as Thixcin ยฎ. When a stabilizer is to be added to the present compositions, it is preferably introduced as a separate stabilizer premix with one or more of the adjuncts, or non-silicone components, of the composition. When such a stabilizer premix is used, it is preferably added into the composition after the cationic silicone polymer has already been introduced and dispersed in the composition.<br>

to a dual-compartment container. In use, the compartment A composition and the compartment B<br>
composition are in each case simultaneously poured from the container into a measuring cup,<br>
generating effervescence upon mixing. In these examples, the compartment A composition and<br>
the compatment B composition are thus separate but combinedly dispensable. In an alternate<br>
separate but combinedly dispensable execution, the compartment A composition and the<br>
compartment B composition are stored in a dual compartment container designed to deliver a 4:1<br>
weight ratio of the compartment A composition, vs the compartment B composition and A and B<br>
are dispensed from a dispenser tap positioned toward the bottom of the dual compartment package<br>
which is gravity fed and does not require pouring from the top. The composition resulting from<br>
mixing A and B in each case (Examples 4a and 4b) are used to launder domestic fabrics with<br>
