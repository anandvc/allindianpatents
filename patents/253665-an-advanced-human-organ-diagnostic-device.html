				<td>An Advanced Human-Organ Diagnostic Device<br>
The invention refers to a new advanced human-organ diagnostic device for the testing of human organs for therapeutic purposes by measuring the electronic current frequency of the organ under examination.<br>
Background of the invention:<br>
There is a diagnostic procedure known, which is used especially by homeopathic practitioners, for the testing of human organs by means of measuring their electronic current frequency. In this procedure, a measuring electrode is applied at certain meridian points on the left or right side of the finger of one hand of the test person, and the frequency produced at the measuring points is measured in Hertz by means of ultrasound.<br>
The measuring points are empirically determined reaction points of the skin and deeper tissue layers, and constitute the point of transmission of stimuli to local segment-reflective, vegetative-reflective and neuro-endocrine areas. A characteristic feature of many of these measuring points is their linear arrangement as a chain of points, or so-called meridians. These chains of points lie preferably in the peripheral area between two segments of the meridian, e.g. at the extremities, where a superimposed projection of dermatome, myotome and sclerotome is most easily recognisable. These measuring points can be determined on the skin of the subject, with regard to their topographical location, by measuring the resistance of the skin or the current frequency.<br>
From the result obtained from the measured frequency, it can be determined by the person performing the test whether the frequency of the organ being tested by this method<br>
varies significantly from the normal frequency range of the organ in question or not. If the ultrasonic frequency obtained falls within the known frequency range of the organ, it can as a rule to be assumed that the organ in question is healthy. If on the other hand the measured frequency varies significantly from the known frequency range of the organ of the test person in question, this can be taken as an indication that the organ is suffering from some complaint or disease.<br>
A wide range of test substances are also used for the testing of human organs, which on the application of a current also provide a measurement result in the form of frequency information. In order to obtain a more accurate or conclusive test result with regard to the organ in question, the result of the frequency measurement with the test substance is compared to the result of the frequency measurement on the body of the test person, and conclusions are then drawn on the condition of the organ under investigation. For the measurement of the test substances, these are decanted into test tubes and then subjected to the measurement procedure.<br>
If the test person is suffering from an illness of a certain organ, for example a heart disease, the subject will usually be taking one or more medications prescribed by a doctor. These medications can also be examined, in the same way as the above-mentioned test substances, in order to determine whether they are suitable for the treatment of the organ of the test person in question.<br>
This procedure based on frequency measurements, which in addition to localisation of the measuring points allows conclusions to be drawn on the energy status of the points and meridians on the basis of the measured skin and tissue frequencies, is generally not very accurately or only poorly reproducible due to the large variation in skin resistance and<br>
its other disturbing influences. Such disturbing influences may for example be based on the moisture or grease content of the skin surface, the condition of the vegetative nervous system of the test person, the application pressure of the tip of the measuring electrode on the measuring point etc., and can significantly affect the result of the measurement. For example, skin with high moisture content will produce a different frequency than dry skin. In addition, the measurement results can be rendered completely invalid by minor disturbances such as physical movement, the taking of stimulants such as coffee or tea, excitement, eating, room temperature, loud noises etc.<br>
A further disadvantage of this procedure is that an enormous range of test substances must permanently be kept available for the different organs and medications and test tubes, all of which is very cost-intensive. Test substances usually have a limited storage life, and must be disposed of after their 'use-by' date, and new test substances provided.<br>
Summary of present invention:<br>
The purpose of the invention is to provide a new advanced human-organ diagnostic device of the type mentioned above, which can be manufactured in a cost-effective way and used long-term, and thereby provide reliable measurement results that can be utilised for the therapy of the subject.<br>
In the case of the invention in question, this purpose is achieved by a new and advanced diagnostic device for the testing of human organs by measuring the electronic current frequency containing two vertically arranged planar components, set up in parallel to each other, which are electronically connected to a measuring sensor that can be moved between them, one of the planar components being connected to a measuring element that<br>
can be brought into contact with the body of the test person, and the other planar component being electronically connected to a computer-controlled evaluation unit. The planar components must naturally consist of an electronically conductive material.<br>
The measuring element that can be brought into contact with the body of the test person produces a measurement on the basis of the skin or tissue frequency, which is transmitted to one of the planar components. In addition, a frequency or frequency range known by a computer programme is transmitted to the other planar component by the computer-controlled evaluation unit. This produces an electro-magnetic field between the two parallel planar components. The electro-magnetic field between the two parallel planar components will demonstrate differing voltage characteristics, depending on whether the measurement result of the measuring element brought into contact with the body of the test person matches or significantly differs from the known frequencies defined by the computer-controlled evaluation unit. A fine current measurement can be carried out using the measuring sensor that can be placed between the planar components. Any difference in the electronic field between the two planar components is thereby measured and transmitted to the computer-controlled evaluation unit, in order to assess this information. By means of a special computer programme, it can then be determined whether the organ of the test person in question is healthy or not.<br>
In addition, the computer programme can suggest therapeutic measures and/or options for the taking of suitable medications. The measurement procedure performed by the new advanced human-organ diagnostic device can thus be reproduced as many times as required. In addition, very accurate results can be obtained by the comparison of the measured values with the known information contained in the computer-controlled evaluation unit. Since no more test substances and test tubes are required, and the new<br>
diagnostic device can be used as often as necessary, it can be used and operated without any great costs.<br>
Detailed description of the invention:<br>
In order to ensure the stable overall construction of the proposed new advanced human-organ diagnostic device for the testing of human organs for therapeutic purposes, which is the subject of the invention, consists of two vertically arranged planar components, set up in parallel to each other, which are electronically connected to a measuring sensor that can be moved between them, one of the planar components being connected to a measuring element that can be brought into contact with the body of the test person, and the other planar component being electronically connected to a computer-controlled evaluation unit. The planar components must naturally consist of an electronically conductive material.<br>
These two vertically arranged planar components are attached to a firm base. This supporting base, may for example, be a base-plate. This allows the new advanced human-organ diagnostic device to be mobile and makes it easy to transport. In addition, this also serves to ensure that the distance between the two planar components remains the same at all times, in order to achieve the most consistent test conditions and obtain accurate measurement results.<br>
The measuring sensor is designed in the form of an antenna, and is intended for the measurement of the current frequency between the two planar components. In this way, and depending on the requirements or wishes of the person treating the test person, the measuring sensor can either be moved manually between the two planar components or placed in a fixed position between them.<br>
In order to ensure the most accurate possible measurement of the organ of the test person under examination, the measuring element should preferably be brought into contact with one of the hands of the test person, since it is known that a person's fingertips are best suited for the measurement of the frequency due both to their sensitivity and the large number of available measuring points located along the meridians.<br>
Accordingly, if the frequency level determined by the measuring element applied to the body of the test person lies within the frequency range of the organ under examination, as specified by the computer-controlled evaluation unit, which is known in advance, the antenna located between the two planar components will be deflected in a vertical direction. This is an indication that the organ of the test person under examination is in a healthy condition. If however the frequency level determined by the measuring element applied to the body of the test person lies outside the frequency range or frequency level specified by the computer-controlled evaluation unit, the antenna would be deflected between the two planar components in a horizontal direction. This means that the organ of the test person under examination is suffering from some malfunction or disease.<br>
In order to allow the measurement of the frequency on the body or the meridian measuring points of the finger of the test person, and to be able to transmit the measurement result to the designated planar component, the measuring element which is brought into contact with the body of the test person must be made of an electrically conductive material.<br>
For the purposes of the two-way transmission and specification of the measurement values, the measuring element which is brought into contact with the body of the test person is connected by an electrical lead to one of the planar components, while the other<br>
planar component is connected by another electrical lead to the computer-controlled evaluation unit. For this purpose, the computer-controlled evaluation unit must consist of an electronic data-processing device. The measuring sensor can also be connected by means of an electrical lead to both of the planar components, which must both be equipped with electrical connection sockets for this purpose.<br>
On the other hand, it is also possible to dispense with the electrical leads from the measuring sensor to the two planar components. Since an electro-magnetic field is created between the two planar components, when the evaluation unit is switched on and the diagnostic device is therefore provided with power, the frequency of the electro-magnetic field will be measured on contact of the measuring element with the test person by the antenna of the measuring sensor, and the measured values will be transmitted to the evaluation unit.<br>
In a further development of the new advanced human-organ diagnostic device, the evaluation unit is connected to a therapy unit. The evaluation unit processes the measurement values obtained from the test person and simultaneously works out specified values for the subsequent therapy of the test person with the aid of an internal computer programme. These specified values are transmitted to the therapy unit and determine the further course of therapy for the person undergoing treatment.<br>
By means of an additional computer programme or a computer programme integrated into the diagnosis programme in the evaluation unit of the new advanced human-organ diagnostic device, the measured and evaluated measurement results, and the specified values for the therapy of the person under treatment, are transmitted to the therapy unit, which undertakes the therapy on the person in question.<br>
Furthermore, the therapy unit can also be brought into contact with the person undergoing therapy. In this procedure, electrodes are applied to the part of the body of the person undergoing therapy, and the frequencies resulting from the specified values are applied to the person undergoing treatment.<br>
There is often a period of several days between diagnosis and therapy, or a single therapy session is insufficient, with the result that there are certain gaps between the therapy sessions. In order to bridge these periods from a therapeutic point of view, the evaluation unit software can determine certain medications, which are specifically tailored to the diagnosis of the person undergoing treatment, and which the person should take in these intervening periods. A new diagnosis should be carried out using the new advanced human-organ diagnostic device after every therapy session, since the original measured values will usually have changed as a result of the time delay.<br>
It must of course also be understood that the above-mentioned features, which will be explained in more detail below, need not only be used in the specified combination, but can also be used in other combinations or on their own, whilst still falling within the framework of the invention.<br>
Thus the especial features of new and advanced human-organ diagnostic device can be compared with the conventional such devices as follows:<br><br>
(Table Removed) <br><br><br>
Details of the figures attached:<br>
The idea on which the invention is based is described in more detail in the following description by means of an example application shown in the drawings. The drawings show:<br>
Fig. 1	Schematic representation of the new advanced human-organ diagnostic<br>
device, which is the subject of the invention in plan view, with connection to an evaluation unit and a therapy unit<br>
Fig. 2	Schematic side view of the diagnostic device, following Fig. 1.<br>
In the figures attached, a number of symbols, in the form of numerals are used for labelling the figures. The new diagnostic device 1 for testing human organs for therapeutic purposes, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2 is fitted with a base-plate 2. On the base-plate 2, there are two planar components 3 and 4, which are arranged in parallel with each other at a defined separation distance, perpendicular to the base-plate 2, as shown particularly in Fig. 2. Both the planar components 3 and 4 are attached to the base-plate 2 by means of brackets 5 or other suitable means of attachment. This ensures that the two planar components 3 and 4 are always at the same distance from each other. Each of these planar components 3 and 4 also has a connection socket 6, 7 for the connection of electrical leads.<br>
The diagnostic device also includes a hand-held measuring device 8 made of an electrically conductive material. This measuring device 8 is connected via an electrical lead 9 to the connection socket 6 of the planar component 3. The diagnostic device 1 also includes a hand-held measuring sensor 10, which is connected on the one hand via an electrical lead 11 to the connection socket 6 of the planar component 3 and on the other<br>
hand via an electrical lead 12 to the connection socket 7 of the planar component 4. The measuring sensor 10 is equipped with an antenna 13, whose front end is designed in the form of a spiral, and which is made of an electrically conductive metal wire.<br>
The diagnostic device 1 is connected via an electrical lead 14 to a computer-controlled evaluation unit 15. This evaluation unit 15 consists of a computer 16 and a screen 17. The computer 16 contains a special computer programme, which transmits certain known frequency information via the electrical lead 14 to the planar component 4.<br>
The measuring element 8 is brought into contact with the hand or finger of a test person, who is to be examined for the illness/malfunction or otherwise of a certain organ. By means of the measuring element 8, the frequency of the skin or other tissue layers is transmitted from certain measuring points of a meridian, which is responsible for a certain organ, via the electrical lead 9 to the planar component 3. At the same time the computer-controlled evaluation unit 15 transmits a certain specified frequency range or frequency level for the organ of the test person under examination to the planar component 4. This produces an electrical field between the two planar components 3 and 4. With the aid of the hand-held measuring sensor 10 and its antenna 13, which is operated by the person performing the examination, any possible difference in the field characteristics between the two planar components 3 and 4 is measured and transmitted via the electrical leads 12 and<br>
14	to the computer-controlled evaluation unit 15. The computer 16 of the evaluation unit<br>
15	produces a therapy plan or a schedule for the prescription of medication for the treatment of the malfunctioning organ of the test person on the basis of the information received, by means of the computer programme.<br>
The evaluation unit 15 is also connected via an electrical lead 18 to a therapy unit 19. By this means the evaluation unit 15 transmits the specified values worked out by the computer programme for the therapy of the part of the body of the test person in question to the therapy unit 19. Via the contacts 20 and 21 coming out of the therapy unit 19, which are applied to the part of the body of the person undergoing therapy, the corresponding frequencies worked out on the basis of the values specified by the evaluation unit 15 are transmitted from the therapy unit 19 to that part of the body of the person undergoing the therapy.<br>
