				<td>Rubber mixtures which contain SBR rubber gels<br>
The invention relates to compositions of rubbers which contain C=C double bonds and styrene/butadiene rubber gels (SBR gels) and to vulcanisates prepared therefrom. The vulcanisates demonstrate unusually high damping at temperatures of from -20 to +20°C and unusually low damping at temperatures of from 40 to 80°C, and are therefore particularly suitable for manufacturing vehicle tyre treads which give good grip in the wet and low rolling resistance.<br>
The literature describes a large number of measures designed to reduce the rolling resistance of tyres, including, inter alia, the use of polychloroprene gels (EP-A 405216) and polybutadiene gels (DE-A 4220563) in tyre treads manufactured from rubbers which contain C=C double bonds. Disadvantages of using polychloroprene gel arise from the high cost of the rubber, the high density of polychloroprene and the ecological disadvantages to which the chlorine-containing components can be expected to give rise in scrap tyre recycling. While polybutadiene gels according to DE-A 42 20 563 do not have these disadvantages, the dynamic damping is in this case reduced at both low temperatures (-20 to +20°C) and also at higher temperatures (40-80CC), which in practice means that advantages in terms of rolling resistance are accompanied by disadvantages in terms of tyre grip in the wet. Sulphur-cross-linked rubber gels according to GB-PS 1 078 400 have no reinforcing effect and are therefore unsuitable for the present application.<br>
It has now surprisingly been found that rubber vulcanisates which contain C=C double bonds and are filled with special SBR gels have high dynamic damping at low temperatures and low dynamic damping at higher temperatures, such that advantages result in terms of both rolling resistance and grip in the wet. Particularly good properties result from using SBR gels in rubber mixtures which contain polybutadiene rubber.<br>
The present invention  relates to rubber composition prepared from at least one<br>
styrene/butadiene rubber gel (A) and at least one rubber which contains double<br>
bonds (B), wherein the styrene/butadiene rubber gel content is from 1 to 100<br>
parts by weight, related to 100 parts by weight of rubber which contains C=C<br>
double bonds, and optionally further fillers and rubber auxiliary substances of <br>
The rubber  composition of this invention is mater a product of a chemical <br>
reaction nor a here adaxture  but a synergestic preparation exhibuting surprising and  <br>
unexpected properties <br>
The present invention therefore provides mixtures prepared from at least one <br>
styrene/butadiene	rubber	gel         (A)    and    at least    one    rubber    <br><br>
which contains         double	bonds	(B),whereinthe    <br>
styrene/butadiene    rubber     gel         content       is    from     1  to 100 parts by<br>
weight, preferably 5 to 75 parts by weight, related to 100 parts by weight of rubber which contains C=C double bonds, and optionally further fillers and rubber auxiliary substances.<br>
Styrene/butadiene rubber gels (A) are understood to denote microgels which are pre¬pared by cross-linking<br>
SBR -	styrene/butadiene copolymers which contain from 1 to 80 wt.%, pre-<br>
ferably 5 to 50 wt.%, of styrene, and/or<br>
XSBR-	styrene/butadiene copolymers and graft polymers with further polar<br>
unsaturated monomers such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, acryl-amide, methacrylamide, N-methoxymethyl methacrylic acid amide, N-acetoxymethyl methacrylic acid amide, acrylonitrile, dimethyl acryl-amide, hydroxyethyl acrylate, hydroxyethyl methacrylate, which con¬tain from 1 to 75 wt.% of styrene and from 1 to 20 wt.% of polar monomers incorporated by polymerisation.<br>
The styrene/butadiene rubber gels have particle diameters of from 5 to 1000, prefer¬ably 20 to 400 nm (DVN value to DIN 53 206) and swelling indices (Q;) in toluene of from 1 to 15, preferably 1 to 10. The swelling index is calculated from the weight of the gel when it contains solvent (following centrifuging at 20,000 rpm) and its weight when dry:<br>
Qi        wet weight of gel/dry weight of gel.<br>
As an example of determining the swelling index, 250 mg of SBR gel is swelled in 25 ml toluene for 24 hours, with shaking. The gel is centrifuged off and weighed, and is then dried at 70°C until the weight is constant, and is reweighed.<br>
The styrene/butadiene rubber starting products are preferably prepared by emulsion polymerisation. In this connection see, for example, I. Franta, Elastomers and Rubber Compounding Materials, Elsevier, Amsterdam 1989, pp. 88 to 92.<br>
The cross-linking of the rubber starting products to form styrene/butadiene rubber gels takes place in the latex state. This may be during polymerisation, as a result of continuing the polymerisation to high conversions or in the monomer feeding process as a result of polymerisation at high internal conversions or as a result of post-cross-linking after polymerisation, or both processes may be combined. The rubber starting products may also be prepared by polymerisation in the absence of regulators.<br>
The styrene/butadiene rubber may also be cross-linked by copolymerisation with multifunctional compounds having a cross-linking action. Preferred multifunctional comonomers are compounds having at least two, preferably 2 to 4, copolymerisable C=C double bonds, such as diisopropenylbenzene, divinylbenzene, divinylether, divinylsulphone, diallyl phthalate, triallyl cyanurate, triallyl isocyanurate, 1,2-poly-butadiene, N,N'-m-phenylene maleic imide and/or triallyl trimellitate. The following are furthermore considered: acrylates and methacrylates of polyvalent, preferably di¬valent to tetravalent, C2-C10 alcohols, such as ethylene glycol, propanediol-1,2, butanediol, hexanediol, polyethylene glycol, having 2 to 20, preferably 2 to 8 oxy-ethylene units, neopentyl glycol, bisphenol A, glycerol, trimethylol propane, penta-erythritol, sorbitol and unsaturated polyesters prepared from aliphatic diols and poly-ols and maleic acid, fumaric acid and/or itaconic acid.<br>
The styrene/butadiene rubbers may also be cross-linked in the latex form to form SBR rubber gels, as a result of post-cross-linking them with chemicals having a cross-link¬ing action. Suitable chemicals having a cross-linking action are, for example, organic peroxides, for example, dicumyl peroxide, t-butylcumyl peroxide, bis-(t-butyl-peroxy-isopropyl) benzene, di-t-butyl peroxide, dibenzoyl peroxide, bis-(2,4-dichlorobenzoyl) peroxide, t-butyl perbenzoate, and organic azo compounds such as azo-bis-iso-butyronitrile and azo-bis-cyclohexanenitrile, and dimercapto and polymercapto com¬pounds such as dimercaptoethane, 1,6-dimercaptohexane, 1,3,5-trimercaptotriazine, and mercapto-terminating polysulphide rubbers such as mercapto-terminating reaction products of bis-chloroethyl formal with sodium polysulphide. The optimal tempera¬ture for the post-cross-linking operation is naturally dependent on the reactivity of the cross-linking agent and may be from room temperature up to approx. 170°C, op-<br>
tionally at elevated pressure. See in this context Houben-Weyl, Methoden der or-ganischen Chemie [Methods in Organic Chemistry], 4th edition, Vol. 14/2, p. 848. Peroxides are particularly preferred cross-linking agents.<br>
It is also optionally possible to enlarge the particles by agglomeration before, during or after the post-cross-linking in latex form.<br>
Styrene/butadiene rubbers which have been prepared in organic solvents may also serve as starting products for the preparation of the styrene/butadiene rubber gels. In this case it is advisable to emulsify the rubber solution in water, optionally with the aid of an emulsifying agent, and to follow this, either before or after removing the organic solvent, with cross-linking of the emulsion thus obtained using suitable cross-linking agents. The cross-linking agents previously named are suitable cross-linking agents.<br>
Preferred rubbers (B) contain double bonds corresponding to iodine values of at least 2, preferably from 5 to 470. Iodine values are generally determined by addition of iodine chloride in ethanoic acid in accordance with Wijs, DIN 53 241, Part 1. The iodine value defines the number of grammes of iodine chemically bound in 100 g of a substance.<br>
The rubbers (B) generally have Mooney viscosities ML l+4/100°C (DIN 53 523) of from 10 to 150, preferably 20 to 120.<br>
In addition to natural rubber, synthetic rubbers are also preferred rubbers (B). Pre¬ferred synthetic rubbers are described in, for example, I. Franta, Elastomers and Rub¬ber Compounding Materials, Elsevier, New York 1989 or in Ullmanns1 Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Vol. A23, VCH Verlagsgesellschaft, Weinheim 1993. They include, inter alia, the following:<br>
BR -	polybutadiene<br>
ABR -	butadiene/acrylic acid-Ci-4 alkylester copolymers<br>
IR -	polyisoprene<br>
SBR -	styrene/butadiene copolymers which contain from 1 to 60 wt.%, pre-<br>
ferably 2 to 50 wt.%, of styrene<br>
XSBR-	styrene/butadiene copolymers and graft polymers with acrylic acid,<br>
methacrylic acid, acrylonitrile, hydroxyethyl acrylate and/or hydroxy-ethyl methacrylate, which contain from 2 to 50 wt.% of styrene and from 1 to 30 wt.% of polar monomers incorporated by polymerisation<br>
IIR -	isobutylene/isoprene copolymers<br>
NBR -	butadiene/acrylonitrile copolymers which contain from 5 to 60 wt.%,<br>
preferably 10 to 50 wt.%, of acrylonitrile<br>
HNBR - partially hydrogenated NBR rubber in which up to 98.5% of the double bonds are hydrogenated<br>
EPDM -         ethylene/propylene/diene copolymers<br>
and mixtures of the latter rubbers.<br>
Natural rubber, emulsion SBR rubber and solution SBR rubber having a glass transi¬tion temperature above -50°C, optionally modified with silyl ethers or other functional groups, such as are described, for example, in EP-A 447 066, polybutadiene rubber having a high cis-1,4 content (&gt; 90%) prepared using catalysts based on nickel, co¬balt, titanium, or neodymium, and polybutadiene rubber which contains 0 to 75% of vinyl, and mixtures thereof, are in particular of interest for the manufacture of, for example, vehicle tyres.<br>
The rubber mixtures according to the invention which are prepared from the sty¬rene/butadiene rubber gel (A) and the rubbers which contain double bonds (B) may additionally contain further fillers.<br>
The following are particularly suitable fillers for the preparation of the rubber mix¬tures and vulcanisates according to the invention:<br>
carbon blacks. The carbon blacks to be used in this case are prepared by the lamp black, furnace black or channel black processes and have BET surface<br>
areas of from 20 to 200 m2/g, such as, for example, SAF, ISAF, IISAF, HAF, FEF or GPF carbon blacks,<br>
highly dispersed silicas prepared, for example, by precipitating silicate solu¬tions or by flame hydrolysis of silicon halides and having specific surface areas of from 5 to 1000, preferably 20 to 400 m2/g (BET surface area), and primary particle sizes of from 5 to 400 nm. The silicas may optionally also be present as mixed oxides with other metal oxides, such as aluminium, magnesium, cal¬cium, barium and zinc oxides and titanium oxides.<br>
synthetic silicates such as aluminium silicate, alkaline earth metal silicates such as magnesium or calcium silicate, having BET surface areas of from 20 to 400 m2/g and primary particle diameters of from 10 to 400 nm,<br>
natural silicates such as kaolin, and other naturally occurring silicas,<br>
metal oxides such as zinc, calcium, magnesium and aluminium oxide,<br>
metal carbonates such as magnesium, calcium and zinc carbonate,<br>
metal sulphates such as calcium and barium sulphate,<br>
metal hydroxides such as aluminium and magnesium hydroxide,<br>
glass fibres and glass fibre products (mats, extrudates) or glass microbeads<br>
rubber gels based on polychloroprene and/or polybutadiene having particle sizes of from 5 to 1000 nm.<br>
The named fillers may be utilised either alone or in mixture. In a particularly preferred embodiment of the process, from 10 to 100 parts by weight of styrene/butadiene rub¬ber gel (A), optionally together with from 0.1 to 100 parts by weight of carbon black<br>
and/or from 0.4 to 100 parts by weight of light-coloured fillers, in each case related to 100 parts by weight of rubber (B), are utilised to prepare the mixtures.<br>
The rubber mixtures according to the invention may contain further rubber auxiliary substances such as cross-linking agents, reaction accelerators, antioxidants, heat sta¬bilisers, light stabilisers, ozone stabilisers, processing auxiliary substances, plasticisers, tackifiers, blowing agents, dyes, pigments, waxes, extenders, organic acids, retar-dants, metal oxides and filler activators such as triethanolamine, polyethylene glycol, hexanetriol, bis(triethoxysilylpropyl) tetrasulphide, etc., which are known in the rub¬ber industry.<br>
The rubber auxiliary substances are utilised in conventional quantities as dictated, inter alia, by the purpose for which they are intended. Conventional quantities are, for example, quantities of from 0.1 to 50 wt.%, related to rubber (B).<br>
Sulphur, sulphur donors or peroxides may be utilised as conventional cross-linking agents. The rubber mixtures according to the invention may furthermore contain vul¬canisation accelerators. Examples of suitable vulcanisation accelerators are mercapto-benzothiazoles, mercaptobenzothiazole sulphene amides, guanidines, thiurams, dithio-carbamates, thioureas and thiocarbonates. The vulcanisation accelerators and sulphur or peroxides are utilised in quantities of from 0.1 to 10 wt.%, preferably 0.1 to 5 wt.%, related to rubber (B).<br>
The rubber mixtures according to the invention may be vulcanised at temperatures of from 100 to 200°C, preferably 130 to 180°C, optionally under 10 to 200 bar pressure.<br>
The rubber mixtures according to the invention which have been prepared from sty-rene/butadiene rubber gel (A) and the rubbers which contain C=C double bonds (B) may be prepared by more than one method: one possibility is naturally to mix the in¬dividual solid components. Rolls, internal mixers and compounding extruders are ex¬amples of units suitable for this purpose. It is, however, also possible to mix them by combining the latices of the styrene/butadiene rubber gels with the latices of the un-cross-linked rubbers. The mixtures according to the invention thus prepared may be<br>
isolated as normal by evaporation, precipitation or freeze coagulation (cf. US-PS 2 187 146). The mixtures according to the invention may be obtained in direct manner as rubber/filler formulations as a result of mixing fillers into the latex mixtures, fol¬lowed by working up.<br>
The rubber mixtures prepared from the styrene/butadiene rubber gel (A) and the rub¬bers which contain double bonds (B) may be further mixed with additional fillers and optionally rubber auxiliary substances in conventional mixing units such as rolls, inter¬nal mixers and compounding extruders. Preferred mixing temperatures are around 50 to 180°C.<br>
The rubber vulcanisates according to the invention are suitable for making mouldings, for example for the manufacture of cable sheaths, hoses, transmission belts, conveyor belts, roll coverings, tyres, in particular tyre treads, shoe soles, sealing rings and damping elements.<br><br>
Examples Example 1<br>
(a)	Cross-linking the SBR rubber in latex form<br>
26,976 g of a SBR latex (Baystal BL 1357 from Bayer France, Port Jerome) contain¬ing 24 wt.% of styrene incorporated by polymerisation and having a particle size of 60 nm (DVN) and a solids content of 37.1 wt.% were diluted with 6,708 g water. 150 g dicumyl peroxide were added in an autoclave at 60°C. The mixture was then stirred under a nitrogen atmosphere at 60°C for 2 hours, after which it was heated to 150PC and stirred at that temperature for 45 minutes. After cooling, it was filtered through a monodur cloth (pore size 0.2 mm). The solids content of the rubber latex was 30 wt.%, the swelling index of the gel particles was 5, and the particle diameter 60 nm.<br>

Comparative Example 2<br>

Example 5<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The investigations show clearly that the styrene/butadiene rubber gels according to the invention afford markedly lower impact resilience values at 23° which, experience shows, correlate with greater grip of the tyres in the wet, while impact resilience at 70°C is at the same level as that of the comparative mixture, giving a rolling resistance of the same order of size. Surprisingly, the use of polybutadiene rubber in the rubber mixture results in a marked improvement in abrasion behaviour without substantially influencing grip in the wet (derived from impact resilience at 23°C). A sulphur-cross-linked rubber gel according to GB-PS 1 078 400 demonstrates no reinforcing proper¬ties and is therefore unsuitable for the application.    <br><br><br>
