PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION <br>
The following specification describes the invention<br><br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to internal combustion engine and more particularly to integrated flywheel assembly for two cylinder internal combustion inline common rail diesel engine to reduce the rotational speed fluctuations, transfer of engine power &amp; provide the input to engine speed measurement.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Conventially flywheel in automotive application is used to reduce the rotational speed fluctuations and transfer of engine power.<br>
In a two-cylinder high-pressure internal combustion diesel inline engine, for automotive applications multifold requirement from the component such as functional requirement, rigidity and compactness are necessary in order to make system less complex.<br>
US4462269 describes the flywheel which is basically a one piece structure comprised of a disc portion and an integrally formed ring portion having gear teeth on its outer circumference. These gear teeth engage the pinion gear on engines starting motor. This prior art teaches only the ring portion provision on the outer periphery of the flywheel.<br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
The main object of this invention is to provide an integrated flywheel assembly to reduce the rotational speed fluctuations for twin cylinder internal combustion inline common rail diesel engine which can operate with minimal speed fluctuation.<br><br><br>
Another object of this invention is to provide an integrated flywheel which is also responsible to transfer the power from an engine to the gear box.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a flywheel which is also responsible to rotate the engine during starting operation.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a flywheel which provides surface area to mount the clutch and pressure plate assembly.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a flywheel which gives the input to sensing device for the measurement of engine speed.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide a flywheel, which is simple in construction and cost effective.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
A novel integrated flywheel assembly for twin cylinder internal combustion inline common rail diesel engine comprises of at least four cylindrical surfaces integrally provided as single structure mounted rigidly on six symmetrical bolts on the crankshaft. This ensures rotation of flywheel at the same speed of crankshaft and serves the purpose of storing the energy during combustion which gets released at other pulses which ensures the minimum fluctuation during overall rotation. One side of the flywheel is a machined flat surface where clutch disc gets support; on the same side at the outer periphery the six symmetrical threaded holes are provided to mount the pressure plate assembly. Ring gear gets shrunk fitted on the outer periphery of the flywheel and gets a drive with the engagement of starter pinion with ring gear. Number of teeth's on the ring gear are provided to ensure the required engine rpm during cranking, in association with number of teeth on starter pinion. Said fly wheel is casted and having sixty minus two teeth with equal thickness and located at<br><br><br>
equal distances with each other to provide required feedback to crank sensing device mounted on the bed plate. This arrangement ensures the correct measurement of engine speed with the consistency, which is a crucial requirement for the effective functioning of common rail diesel engine. This energy storing device with multiple functions is the key feature of this invention.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring now to the drawings wherein the showings are for the purpose of illustrating a preferred embodiment of the invention only, and not for the purpose of limiting the same,<br>
Flywheel in accordance with this invention shown in figure 1 &amp; 2 is designed with rigid structure mounted rigidly on six bolts (1) on the crankshaft. This ensures rotation of flywheel at the same speed of crankshaft and serves the purpose of storing the energy during combustion which gets released at other pulses which ensures the minimum fluctuation during overall rotation. Ring gear (2) is shrunk fitted at the periphery of the flywheel with the number of teeth designed to ensure to required engine rpm during starting, in association with number of teeth on starter pinion. Engagement of ring gear on the<br><br><br>
flywheel with respect to starter pinion is shown in figure 4. Machined smooth face (3) with required diameter is provided on the side face of flywheel to support the clutch facing material. On the same side six numbers of symmetrical threaded holes (4) provided which ensures the mounting of pressure plate assembly. As cast sixty minus two teeth (5) provides required feedback to crank sensing device which enables the correct measurement of engine speed. Uniform gap between the teeth ensures the consistency in the output, which is a crucial requirement for common rail diesel engine. Therefore, the multifold out put from the single fly wheel is the key feature of this invention.<br>
A novel integrated flywheel assembly in accordance with this invention carries out the following functions<br>
A)	Reduce the rotational speed fluctuations<br>
B)	Transmits the power from an engine to the gear box<br>
C)	Rotate the engine during starting operation.<br>
D)	Provides surface are to support the clutch facing.<br>
E)	Provides the mountings to pressure plate assembly.<br>
F)	Provides input to sensing device for the measurement of engine speed.<br>
The foregoing description is a specific embodiment of the present invention. It<br>
should be appreciated that this embodiment is described for purpose of<br>
illustration only, and that numerous alterations and modifications may be<br>
practiced by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope<br>
of the invention. It is intended that all such modifications and alterations be<br>
included insofar as they come within the scope of the invention as claimed or<br>
the equivalents thereof.</td>
