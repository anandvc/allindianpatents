				<td>FORM 2THE PATENT ACT 1970(39 of 1970)&amp;The Patents Rules, 2003PROVISIONAL  SPECIFICATION(See section 10 and rule l3)<br>
1. TITLE OF THE INVENTION: "Novel process for preparation of Adapalene"<br>
2. APPLICANT(a)	NAME: M/S. INDOCO REMEDIES LIMITED.(b)	NATIONALITY: Indian Company incorporated under the IndianCompanies ACT, 1956 (c) ADDRESS: Indoco House, 166 C. S. T. Road, Santacruz (East), Mumbai -400 098. Maharashtra, India<br>
3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRD7TION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention.<br><br>
Field of invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a novel method for the preparation of the compound 6-[3-(1- Adamantyl) - 4 - methoxy phenyl] - 2 - naphthoic acid known as adapalene employing a novel intermediate 3 - Adamantyl - 4 - methoxyphenyl potassium trifluoroborate.<br>
Background and Prior art:<br>
The compound 6-[3-(l- Adamantyl) - 4 - methoxy phenyl] - 2 - naphthoic acid of Formula - I known as Adapalene is used in dermatology, particularly in the treatment of acne vulgaris and psoriasis.<br><br>
l.KOH: 2. HC1.<br>
Scheme -1<br>
2<br>
Formula -1 Adapalene was first time disclosed in the US patent No. 4,717,720 (herein after referred as '720) describe the preparation of compound of Formula - I using Negishi cross Coupling. In this reaction, 2-(l-adamantyl)-4-bromoanisole is converted to its organomagnesium compound followed by conversion to organozinc compound using zinc chloride and reacted with 6-bromo-2-methylnaphthoate employing reaction catalyst a transition metal such as palladium or nickel or one of its complexes with various phosphines. The reaction sequence is as shown in scheme - 1 below:<br><br><br><br>
Another US patent No. 5,015,758 describe the process for preparation of 6[3-(l-Adamantyl) - 4 - methoxyphenyl] - 2 - naphthoate a penultimate step for preparation of Adapalene using Friedel - Crafts alkylation by reacting 1 - acetoxy adamantane with methyl - 6 - (4 - hydroxyphenyl) - 2 - naphthoate in presence of cone. Sulfuric acid in solvent n - heptane.<br>
Another improved process was published in the journal, Organic Process Research &amp; Development, 2006, 10, 285 - 288 for the preparation of Adapalene. The process involves the preparation of intermediates followed by Negishi cross Coupling, where in 2-(l-adamantyl)-4-bromophenol was prepared using 1 - adamentol and 4- bromo phenol in presence of 98% sulphuric acid and acetic acid, which on methylation with dimethyl sulfate and potassium carbonate in dry acetone yields 2-(l-adamantyl)-4-bromoanisole. The compound is reacted with magnesium to form Grignard reagent and then coupled with 6-bromo-2-methylnaphthoate in presence of novel Pd - Zn double metal catalyst to yield ester, which on saponification and treatment with acid yields Adapalene.<br>
The recent published application WO 2006/108717 describes the use of Suzuki coupling for the synthesis of adapalene the compound of formula -1. The application describes the preparation of 3-adamantyl-4-methoxyphenyl boronic acid from 2-(l-adamantyl)-4-bromoanisole using n-Butyl Lithium and triisopropyl borate in solvent THF. Finally 3-adamantyl-4-methoxyphenyI boronic acid is reacted with 6-bromo-2-naphthoic acid involving Suzuki coupling in presence of Palladium acetate catalyst, a ligand 2 -(dicyclohexyl - phosphino) biphenyl, an inorganic base in solvent to get the compound adapalene.<br>
Some of the drawbacks of the prior art processes include:<br>
- The reported process in US patent 4717720, using Negishi cross coupling firstly involves Grignard reaction. This requires anhydrous condition and a possibility of runaway reaction during Grignard reagent formation. Also the reaction involves the addition of freshly fused ZnC12 and the preparation of the catalyst NiC12 (DPPE) complex, which also needs to be freshly prepared and has to be thoroughly dried before its use for coupling. Further the coupling reaction, results in the formation of dimer impurities during the organozinc compound reaction,<br>
3<br><br>
with 2-( 1 -adamantyl)-4-bromoanisole and 6-bromo-2-methylnaphthoate respectively, which are difficult to remove. All these operations make the entire synthesis extremely sensitive and difficult to handle.<br>
-	Some of the above drawbacks were addressed by the authors in the article published in Organic Process Research &amp; Development, 2006, 10, 285 - 288 for the preparation of Adapalene. But the use of Pd catalyst with the ligand like PdC2 (PPh3)2 for the direct conversion of Grignard reagent employing ZnC12 in catalytic amount has its own limitations. The use of Grignard reagent, palladium catalyst with ligand and hygroscopic ZnCl2 demerits this process for industrial application.<br>
-	The recent published application WO 2006/108717; describes the use of Suzuki coupling for the synthesis of adapalene the compound of formula - I. The use of organo boronic acids for the Suzuki reaction has some limitations because of the indeterminate stoichiometry associated with the use of boronic acid, and its difficulty in purification and the byproducts formed during the reaction.<br>
Therefore there remains a need for an improved process for preparing adapalene that eliminates or substantially reduces the impurities, decreases the number of steps, and employs a more robust process which is convenient and cost efficient.<br>
The present inventors have come out with a novel process which ameliorates the problems in the prior art with a one - pot process for the preparation of adapalene by employing Suzuki - Miyaura coupling involving the use of novel reactant 3-adamantyl-4-methoxyphenyl potassium trifluoroborate.<br>
The inventors have observed that Potassium organotrifluoroborates (BF3K) moiety is compatible with sensitive functional groups and is tolerant to hostile reaction conditions such as epoxidation, ozonolysis, osmylation and metal-halogen exchange. Most importantly, these novel nucleophiles perform well in cross coupling and other important reactions. Additionally, Potassium organotrifluoroborates are air and moisture-stable crystalline solids which are readily accessible by a variety of high yielding methods and can be stored for extended periods of time making it more industrial friendly to use on<br>
4<br><br>
large scale production. The novel compound 3 - Adamantyl - 4 - methoxy phenyl potassium trifluoroborate, exhibit superb behavior in the Suzuki-Miyaura reaction and provides a powerful method for the preparation of 6 - [3-(l- Adamantyl) - 4 - methoxy phenyl] - 2 - naphthoic acid the compound of Formula -1.<br><br>
Formula -1<br>
The other advantage of the present invention is in the use of methyl ester of 6 - Bromo -2 -naphthoic acid and isolating adapalane directly from the reaction instead of its methyl ester, the above process becomes more robust and eliminates the saponification step as reported in prior art. Also the use of readily and cheaply available Pd catalyst on carbon over the conventional and costlier Pd-catalyst with ligands offers further advantage to the current process.<br>
Objectives of the invention:<br>
The objective of the present invention is to prepare pharmacopially pure 6-[3-(l-Adamantyl) - 4 - methoxy phenyl] - 2 - naphthoic acid using an improved process.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to prepare 6-[3-(l- Adamantyl)-4 - methoxy phenyl] - 2 - naphthoic acid by an industrially useful and viable process.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to prepare 6-[3-(l- Adamantyl) - 4 -methoxy phenyl] - 2 - naphthoic acid by using the novel compound 3 - adamantly - 4 -methoxyphenyl potassium trifluoroborate.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is the preparation of pure 3-adamantyl-4-methoxyphenyl potassium trifluoroborate compound.<br>

According to the present invention the preparation of 6 - [3-(l- Adamantyl) - 4 -methoxy phenyl] - 2 - naphthoic acid can be represented in the reaction sequence Scheme - 2 below:<br><br><br><br>
