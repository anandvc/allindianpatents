Figs 5 and 6 are cutsection isometric views of the housing of a multilever barrel centre lock of the luggage case including an interlocking means according to an embodiment of the invention prior to anchoring or fastening of the insert to the slide of the interlocking means; and<br>
Figs 7 and 8 are cutsection isometric views of the housing of a multilever barrel centre lock of the luggage case including an interlocking means according to an embodiment of the invention after anchoring or fastening of the insert to the slide of the interlocking means.<br>
As illustrated in relation to Figs 1 to 8 of the accompanying drawings, 1 is a security mechanism comprising a casing comprising an inner casing member 2 and an outer casing member 3. The inner casing member comprises a trough shaped body provided with a slot 4 at one end thereof. The outer casing member comprises a channel shaped body whose one end defines a tubular portion 5 tapered internally and is provided with a tongue 6.The two casing members are fitted to the metallic frame 7 of a luggage case 8 by locating the tubular portion of the outer casing member in an opening 9 in the metallic frame of the luggage case with the tongue 6 engaged in the slot 4 at the one<br>
8<br><br>
end of the inner casing member and fixing the other ends of the inner and outer casing members to the metallic frame by securing screw 10 through screw hole 11 in boss 12 provided in the inner casing member and screw hole 13 provided in the metallic frame and screw hole (not shown) in boss 14 in the outer casing member. 15 is a metallic chain accommodated within the inner casing member. The inner end of the metallic chain is anchored within the inner casing member by looping the innermost link 16 of the metallic chain around a lancing 17 formed on a support member 18 fitted at the innerside of the metallic frame by rivets 19, 19 secured through rivet holes 20, 20 in the metallic frame and rivet holes 21, 21 provided in the support member. The outer end of the chain protrudes out through the tubular portion of the outer casing member and opening 9 in the metallic frame and is provided with a stopper 22 fitted with an insert 23. The stopper is tapered (taper marked 22a) corresponding to the taper in the tubular portion of the channel shaped body of the outer casing member and adapted to be push or press fitted in the tubular portion. The outer surface of the tubular portion is provided with a depression 24 for finger to facilitate ejection of the stopper from the tubular portion. The insert is tapered at the tip thereof marked 25 and is provided with a cleft 26 at one face thereof. The stopper prevents the<br>
9<br><br>
chain being slid or pushed in fully into the inner casing member. Due to the taper of the stopper and corresponding taper in the tubular portion, the stopper remains snap fitted in the tubular portion even when the luggage case receives jerks or vibration? during its usage. The luggage case comprises a multilevel barrel centre lock 27 provided with an interlocking means comprising a slide 28 disposed in a recess 29 in the housing 30 of the lock. The slide is held compressed by compression spring 31 against the drum 32 of the lock. The spring is located in a groove 33 in the housing . The slide thickness corresponds to the cleft in the insert . 34 is a cover plate of the housing provided with an opening 35 corresponding to an opening 36 in the slide. 37 is a cam provided on the drum of the barrel lock. The cover plate is fitted to the housing of the barrel lock by securing screws (not shown) through screw holes 38 in the cover plate and screw holes 39 in the housing.<br>
On locking the barrel lock by turning the drum in the anticlockwise direction with a key ( not shown) introduced in the key hole 40 at the outer face of the drum in known manner, the cam 37 on the drum rotates with drum in the anticlockwise direction and disengages from the slide as a result of which the slide displaces in the direction of the drum with<br>
10<br><br>
the force of expansion of the spring 31 . When the shde is displaced in the direction of the drum the opening 36 in the shde hes offset with the opening 35 in the cover plate. The chain is run or looped around a rigid or fixed member such as leg of a seat in a train (not shown) or a post (not shown) and the tapered tip of the insert is pushed inside through the openings in the cover plate and shde. The tip of the insert slides against the shde into the recess in the housing of the multilever barrel lock through corresponding openings in the cover plate and shde against the spring force. The taper at the tip of the insert facilitates sliding of the insert into the recess against the shde. When the insert slides into the recess against the shde the spring gets compressed till the insert engages over the shde at the cleft .Thereafter the spring expands and pushes the slide in the direction of the drum.The shde hes spring stressed in the direction of the drum with the opening in the shde offset with the opening in the cover plate .The insert is spring stressed against the sidewall of the opening in the cover plate and cannot be disengaged from the shde and pulled out. The insert remains anchored or fastened to the shde and the luggage case is anchored to the rigid or fixed member as long as the luggage case is kept locked.On unlocking the barrel lock by turning the drum in the clockwise direction with a key (not shown) introduced in the key hole<br>
11<br><br>
in known manner, the cam rotates with the drum clockwise and pushes and displaces the shde in the direction of the spring and the spring gets compressed. The openings in the shde and cover plate are aligned and the insert is free to be disengaged and pulled out from the openings. The suitcase is unfastened from the rigid or fixed member by disengaging the chain. The chain is pushed inside the inner casing member through the tubular portion of the outer casing member and the tapered stopper is push or press fitted in the tubular portion. When the luggage case rests on its back against a surface the chain can be slid into the inner casing member easily under gravity.<br>
The security mechanism comprises less number of components. The metallic chain is relatively stronger and there are practically no chances of breakage. Therefore, the security mechanism is less expensive and reliable. Besides , the security mechanism is simple in construction and easy to handle and operate.<br>
The inner casing member and outer casing member may be of different geometries / profiles and may be fitted to the metallic frame by a<br>
12<br><br>
different arrangement. The metallic chain may be of a different metal besides being stainless steel. The outer casing member is optional and is essentially to cover the rivets and for aesthetic purpose. The inner end of the chain may be anchored within the inner casing member by a different arrangement. The stopper, insert and interlocking means maybe of different geometries/constructions. Such variations of the invention are to be construed and understood to be within the scope of the invention.<br>
