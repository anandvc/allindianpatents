COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"NOVEL DIHYDROPYRIMIDINE COMPOUNDS OF THE GENERAL FORMULA<br>
(I)"<br>
BAYER AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT, a body corporate organised under the laws of Germany, of D-51368 Leverkusen, Germany,<br>
GRANTED<br>
15-11-2007<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br>
ORIGINAL<br>
200/MUMNP/2003<br><br>
The present invention relates to novel dihydropyrimidine compounds of the general formula (I). '<br>
The present invention relates to novel dihydropyrimidine compounds, to processes for their preparation and to their use as medicaments, in particular for the treatment and prophylaxis of hepatitis B.<br>
Dihydropyrimidines having cardiovascular action are already known from the publication EP 103 796 A2.<br>
The present application describes dihydropyrimidine compounds (claims 1-7), method for the production thereof (claim 8), medicament containing one of the claimed dihydropyrimidines (claim 9).<br>
None of the compounds covered by claims 1-7, 9 and 10 is known from the prior art.<br>
The claimed compounds (I) and (la) differ from the compounds disclosed in Examples 23 and 24 of Dl in that the substituent in position 2 of the dihydropyrimidine ring is a substituted pyridyl, whereas the known compounds have a non-substituted pyridyl residue in position 2.<br>
The technical problem addressed by the present application was that of providing substances suitable for use as active agent in the treatment of hepatitis B infection.<br>
Since the dihydropyrimidine compounds disclosed in Dl are only known to have an effect on the cardiovascular system, the special physiological effect of the present compounds (i.e. their suitability for use as agents in the treatment of hepatitis B infections) is surprising, and it would not have been obvious for an expert to consider using dihydropyrimidine derivatives to resolve the technical problem addressed by the application.<br>
The present invention now provides novel dmydropyrimidine compounds of the general formula (I)<br><br>
or their isomeric form (la)<br><br>

The reaction temperatures can be varied within a relatively wide range. In general, the reaction is carried out between 20 and 150°C, but preferably at the boiling point of the solvent in question.<br>
The reaction can be carried out at atmospheric pressure, or else at elevated pressure. In general, the reaction is carried out at atmospheric pressure.<br>
The reaction can be carried out with or without addition of base or acid; however, it has been found that a reaction according to the invention is preferably carried out in the presence of relatively weak acids, such as, for example, acetic acid or formic acid.<br>

With respect to the salts of this compound, reference is made to the abovementioned acid addition salts and in particular to the hydrochloride. This compound is prepared as described in the examples, and, in this respect, reference is also made to the reaction scheme shown below.<br>

The antiviral activity of the compounds according to the invention was investigated following the methods described by Sells et al. (M.A. Sells, M.-L. Chen, and G. Acs (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. and Korba et al. (B.E. Korba and<br>
J.L. Gerin (1992) Antiviral Research <br>
The antiviral tests were carried out in 96-well microtitre plates. Only growth medium and Hep
served as virus control.<br>
Stock solutions of the test compounds (50 mM) were initially dissolved in DMSO, and further dilutions were prepared in the growth medium of HepG2.2.15. The com¬pounds according to the invention, usually in a test concentration of 100 (1st test concentration), were in each case pipetted into the second vertical test row of the microtitre plate and subsequently diluted, by a factor of 2 each time, up to 210-fold, using growth medium plus of foetal calf serum (volume 25 <br>
  of a Hep cell suspension cells/ml) in growth medium plus <br>
foetal calf serum were then added to each well of the microtitre plate.<br>
J«<br><br>

The test batch was incubated at days.<br>
The supernatant was subsequently siphoned off and discarded, and of freshly<br>
prepared growth medium were added to the wells. Once more, the compounds ac¬cording to the invention were added, in each case as a solution 10-fold-concentrated, in a volume of The batches were incubated for another 4 days.<br>
Before the supematants were harvested for determining the antiviral effect, the Hep cells were examined under the light microscope or by biochemical de-<br>
tection methods (for example Alamar Blue staining or Trypan Blue staining) for cy¬totoxic changes.<br>
The supematants were subsequently harvested and, by means of reduced pressure, siphoned onto 96-well dot blot chambers covered with a nylon membane (in accor¬dance with the specifications of the manufacturer).<br>
Determination of the cytotoxicity<br>
Substance-induced cytotoxic or cytostatic changes in the Hep cells were de-<br>
termined as changes in the cell morphology, for example under a light microscope. Such substance-induced changes of the HepG2.2.15 cells in comparison with un¬treated cells could be observed, for example, as cell lysis, vacuolization or changed cell morphology. 50% cytotoxicity means that of the cells have a<br>
morphology which is similar to the corresponding cell control.<br>
The compatibility of some of the compounds according to the invention was addi¬tionally tested on other host cells, such as, for example, HeLa cells, primary peripheral human blood cells or transformed cell lines, such as H-9 cells. At. concentrations of the compounds according to the invention no cyto-<br>
toxic changes were observed.<br><br>
Le A 32 792-Foreign Countries<br>
Determination of the antiviral activity<br>
After transfer of the supernatants onto the nylon membrane of the blot apparatus (see above), the supernatants of the HepG2.2.15 cells were denatured  NaOH), neutralized and washed By<br>
incubation of the filters at 120°C for 2-4 hours, the DNA was subsequently baked onto the membrane.<br>
Hybridization of the DNA<br>
The viral DNA of the treated cells on the nylon filters was usually de-<br>
tected using non-radioactive digoxygenin-labelled hepatitis B-specific DNA probes which were in each case in accordance with the specifications of the manufacturer labelled with digoxygenin, purified and used for hybridization.<br>
The prehybridization and hybridization was carried out in 5 x SSC, 1 x blocking rea¬gent, 0.1% N-lauroylsarcosine, and 100 af DNA from herring sperm. The prehybridization was carried out at 60°C for 30 minutes and the specific hybridi¬zation was carried out using 20 to 40 ng/ml of the digoxygenated denatured HBV-specific DNA (14 hours, 60°C). The filters were subsequently washed.<br>
Determination of HBV DNA by digoxygenin antibodies<br>
The digoxygenin-labelled DNA was detected immunologically in accordance with the specifications of the manufacturer:<br>
The filters were washed and prehybridized in a blocking agent (in accordance with the specifications of the manufacturer). They were subsequently hybridized for 30 minutes using an anti-DIG antibody linked to alkaline phosphatase. After a washing step, the substrate of alkaline phosphatase, CSPD, was added, incubated with the filters for 5 minutes, subsequently wrapped in plastic film and incubated at 37°C for a further 15 minutes. The chemiluminescence of the Hepatitis B-specific DNA sig-<br><br>
Le A 32 792-Foreign Countries<br>
nals was visualized by exposition of the filters on an X-ray film (incubation, de¬pending on the signal strength: 10 minutes to 2 hours).<br>
The half-maximum inhibitory concentration inhibitory concentration 50%)<br>
was determined as the concentration at which the hepatitis B-specific band was re¬duced by 50% in comparison with an untreated sample by the compound according to the invention.<br>
Surprisingly, the treatment of the hepatitis B virus-producing HepG cells with<br>
the compounds according to the invention resulted in a reduction of viral DNA in the cell culture supernatant, the viral DNA being released by the cells into the cell cul¬ture supernatant in the form of virions.<br>
The compounds according to the invention have a novel unforeseeable and useful action against viruses. Surprisingly, they are antivirally active against hepatitis B (HBV) and are therefore suitable for treating virus-induced diseases, in particular acute and chronically persisting HBV virus infections. A chronic viral disease caused by HBV can lead to clinical pictures of various gravity; as is known, chronic hepati¬tis B virus infection frequently results in cirrhosis of the liver and/or hepatocellular carcinoma.<br>
Examples which may be mentioned of areas of indication for the compounds usable according to the invention are:<br>
The treatment of acute and chronic virus infections which may lead to an infectious hepatitis, for example infections with hepatitis B viruses. Particular preference is given to the treatment of chronic hepatitis B infections and the treatment of acute hepatitis B virus infection.<br>
