				<td>SYSTEMS AND METHODS OF DISCRIMINATING CONTROL SOLUTION<br>
FROM A PHYSIOLOGICAL SAMPLE<br>
RELATED APPLICATION(S)<br>
This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. ยง119 to U.S. Provisional Patent<br>
Application Serial No. 60/976,083, filed September 28, 2007, entitled "System and<br>
Methods of Discriminating Control Solution from a Physiological Sample," the entirety<br>
of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD<br>
The system and method provided herein relates to the field of medical testing, in<br>
particular the detection of the presence and/or concentration of an analyte(s) within a<br>
sample (e.g., blood).<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Analyte concentration determination in physiological fluids (e.g., blood or blood<br>
derived products such as plasma) is of ever increasing importance in today's society.<br>
Such assays find use in a variety of applications and settings, including clinical<br>
laboratory testing, home testing, etc., where the results of such testing play a prominent<br>
role in the diagnosis and management of a variety of disease conditions. Analytes of<br>
interest include glucose for diabetes management, cholesterol for monitoring<br>
cardiovascular conditions, and the like.<br>
A common method for analyte concentration determination assays is based on<br>
electrochemistry. In such methods, an aqueous liquid sample is placed into a sample<br>
reaction chamber in an electrochemical cell made up of at least two electrodes, i.e., a<br>
reference and working electrode, where the electrodes have an impedance that renders<br>
them suitable for amperometric or coulometric measurement. The component to be<br>
analyzed is allowed to react with a reagent to form an oxidizable (or reducible)<br>
substance in an amount proportional to the analyte concentration. The quantity of the<br>
oxidizable (or reducible) substance present is then estimated electrochemically and<br>
related to the analyte concentration in the sample.<br><br>
An automated device, e.g., an electrochemical test meter is typically employed<br>
for determining the concentration of the analyte in the sample. Many test meters<br>
advantageously allow for an analyte concentration, and usually a plurality of analyte<br>
concentrations, to be stored in the memory of the meter. This feature provides the user<br>
with the ability to review analyte concentration levels over a period of time, often times<br>
as an average of previously collected analyte levels, where such averaging is performed<br>
according to an algorithm associated with the meter. However, to ensure that the system<br>
is functioning properly, the user will occasionally perform a test using a control fluid<br>
instead of a blood sample. Such control fluids (also referred to as control solutions) are<br>
generally aqueous solutions having a known concentration of glucose. The user can<br>
perform a test with the control solution and compare the displayed results with the<br>
known concentration to determine if the system is functioning properly. However, once<br>
the control solution test is performed, the glucose concentration of the control fluid is<br>
stored in the memory of the meter. Thus, when a user seeks to review previous tests<br>
and/or the average concentration of previous test results, the results may be skewed to<br>
the concentration of the control fluid analyte level.<br>
Thus, it is desirable to be able to distinguish control solutions and sample fluids<br>
during a test. One option is to manually flag the fluids as either control or test fluids.<br>
However automatic flagging would be preferable since it minimizes user interaction and<br>
increases ease-of-use.<br>
As such, there is continued interest in the development of new methods and<br>
devices for use in the determination of analyte concentrations in a sample. Of particular<br>
interest would be the development of such methods and devices that include the ability<br>
to automatically flag a sample as a control fluid or test fluid and to store or exclude<br>
measurements accordingly. Of particular interest would be the development of such<br>
methods that are suitable for use with electrochemical based analyte concentration<br>
determination assays.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
Various aspects of a system and method for distinguishing between an aqueous<br>
non-blood sample (e.g., a control solution) and a blood sample are provided herein. In<br>
one such aspect, the methods include using a test striip in which a potential is applied and<br><br>
a current is measured. Current values are used to determine if a sample is a blood<br>
sample or a non-blood sample based on at least one characteristic. Further described<br>
herein are methods for calculating a discrimination criterion based upon at least two<br>
characteristics. Still further described herein are systems for distinguishing between<br>
blood samples and non-blood samples.<br>
In one embodiment, a method for distinguishing between a blood sample and a<br>
non-blood sample is disclosed. The method includes introducing a sample into an<br>
electrochemical cell having first and second electrodes and applying a first test potential<br>
between the first electrode and the second electrode. A resulting first current transient is<br>
then measured. A second test potential is applied between the first electrode and the<br>
second electrode and a second current transient is then measured. The method can also<br>
include applying a third test potential between the first electrode and the second<br>
electrode, and measuring a third current transient.<br>
Based on the first current transient, a first reference value related to the quantity<br>
of redox species in the sample is calculated. In addition, based on the second and third<br>
current transients, a second reference value related to reaction kinetics is calculated.<br>
The first and second reference values are then used to determine whether the sample is a<br>
non-blood sample or a blood sample. The non-blood sample can be a control solution or<br>
some other sample such as a beverage (e.g., a sports drink such as Gatoradeยฎ).<br>
In one aspect, the first reference value is proportional to a concentration of an<br>
interferent in the sample. For example, the first reference value can be an interferent<br>
index calculated based upon at least one current value from the first current transient.<br>
The second reference values can be a function of a percent completion of a chemical<br>
reaction. For example, the second reference value can be a residual reaction index<br>
calculated based upon at least one current value from the second current transient and at<br>
least one current value from the third current transient. In one aspect, the residual<br>
reaction index is calculated based upon a ratio of a second current value and a third<br>
current value.<br>
In another aspect, the method can perform the step of measuring a concentration<br>
of an analyte in the sample. If the sample is found to be a blood sample, the measured<br>
concentration can be stored. Conversely, if the sample is found to be a non-blood<br>
sample, the measured concentration can be flagged, stored separately, and/or discarded.<br><br>
In one embodiment, statistical classification can be used to determine if the<br>
sample is a non-blood sample or a blood sample. For example, an equation representing<br>
an empirically derived discrimination line can be used to evaluate the first and second<br>
reference values.<br>
In another aspect, an open-circuit potential is applied to the electrochemical cell<br>
before the step of applying the first test potential. In addition, an open-circuit potential<br>
can be applied after the step of applying the first test potential.<br>
Further described herein is a system for distinguishing between a blood sample<br>
and a non-blood sample. In one embodiment, the system can include a test strip and a<br>
test meter. The test strip includes electrical contacts for mating with the test meter and<br>
an electrochemical cell. The test meter includes a processor configured to receive<br>
current data from the test strip, and data storage containing discrimination criteria for<br>
distinguishing a blood sample from a non-blood sample based on antioxidant<br>
concentration and reaction kinetics. The discrimination criteria can be derived from an<br>
interferent index that is representative of antioxidant concentration and a residual<br>
reaction index that is representative of reaction kinetics. For example, the<br>
discrimination criteria can include an empirically derived discrimination line. The<br>
system can further include a non-blood sample (e.g., a control solution) that is<br>
substantially devoid of redox species.<br>
Still further described herein is a method for calculating a discrimination<br>
criterion. The discrimination criterion can be programmed into a test meter for<br>
distinguishing between a blood sample and a non-blood sample. In one embodiment,<br>
the method includes calculating an interferent index and a residual reaction index for a<br>
plurality of non-blood samples and calculating a discrimination criterion based on a<br>
regression of the interferent index and the residual reaction index for the plurality of<br>
non-blood samples.<br>
In one aspect, the discrimination criterion is a discrimination line. For example,<br>
the method can include plotting an interferent index and a residual reaction index for a<br>
plurality of blood samples and shifting the discrimination line towards the plurality of<br>
blood samples.<br><br>
In one aspect, a method is provided for distinguishing between a blood sample<br>
and a control solution which includes (a) applying a first test potential between a first<br>
electrode and a second electrode when a sample is introduced into an electrochemical<br>
cell and measuring a first current transient, (b) applying a second test potential between<br>
a first electrode and a second electrode wherein the second test potential can be<br>
sufficient to oxidize a reduced mediator at the second electrode and measuring a second<br>
current transient, (c) applying a third test potential between a first electrode and a second<br>
electrode wherein the third test potential can be sufficient to oxidize a reduced mediator<br>
at the first electrode. Further, the method can include measuring a third current<br>
transient. The method can also include (d) calculating;, based on the first current<br>
transient, a first reference value, (e) calculating, based on the second and third current<br>
transients, a second reference value, and (f) determining, based on the first and second<br>
reference values, whether the sample is a control solution or blood sample.<br>
The various reference values mentioned above can be determined and/or<br>
calculated in various manners. For example, the first reference value can be<br>
proportional to a concentration of an interferent in the sample, the first reference value<br>
can be calculated based upon at least one current value from the first current transient, or<br>
the first reference value can be calculated based upon a summation of current values<br>
measured during the first current transient. In an embodiment wherein the first reference<br>
value can be calculated based upon a summation of current values measured during the<br>
first current transient, the summation can be represented by an equation, the equation<br><br>
In other embodiments, the second reference value can also be calculated or<br>
determined in various manners. For example, the second reference value can be based<br>
on a percent completion of a chemical reaction, the second reference value can be based<br>
upon at least one current value from the second current transient and at least one current<br>
value from the third current transient, or the second reference value can be based upon a<br>
second current value at about the end of the second current transient and a third current<br>
value at about the beginning of the third current transient. In other embodiments, the<br>
second reference value can be based upon a ratio of the second current value and the<br>
third current value wherein the ratio can be represented by an equation, the equation<br><br><br>
In various embodiments of the method, various orientations and/or<br>
configurations of various components of a system can be utilized. For example, in one<br>
embodiment, the first electrode and the second electrode can have an opposing face<br>
arrangement wherein a reagent layer can be disposed on the first electrode and not<br>
disposed on the second electrode. In another embodiment, the first electrode and the<br>
second electrode can have a co-planar arrangement with a reagent layer disposed on the<br>
first electrode and not disposed on the second electrode.<br>
Various embodiments of the method can also include various additional or<br>
optional steps. For example, in one embodiment, the method can include the step of<br>
measuring a concentration of an analyte wherein, for example, if the sample is found to<br>
be a control solution the analyte concentration associated with the control sample is<br>
flagged. Additionally, in one embodiment, above-identified step (f) can further include<br>
using a statistical classification to determine if the sample is a control solution or a blood<br>
sample. In another embodiment, above-identified step (f) can further include comparing<br>
the first reference value to a pre-determined threshold value, and comparing the second<br>
reference value to a pre-determined threshold equation (e.g., an equation which is a<br>
function of the first reference value) to determine if the sample is a control solution or a<br>
blood sample.<br>
In another aspect, a system for distinguishing between a blood sample and a<br>
control solution sample is provided. In one embodiment, the system can include (a) a<br>
test strip including electrical contacts for mating with a test meter and an<br>
electrochemical cell which includes (i) a first electrode and a second electrode in a<br>
spaced apart relationship, and (ii) a reagent. Further, the system can include (b) a test<br>
meter including a processor configured to receive current data from the test strip, and<br>
data storage containing discrimination criteria for distinguishing a blood sample from a<br>
control sample (e.g., a sample being substantially devoid of redox species) based on<br>
antioxidant concentration and reaction kinetics.<br>
In various embodiments, the above-mention discrimination criteria can be<br>
derived from various sources. For example, in one embodiment, the discrimination<br>
criteria can be derived from an interferent index that is representative of antioxidant<br><br>
concentration and a residual reaction index that is representative of reaction kinetics. In<br>
another embodiment, the discrimination criteria can include an empirically derived<br>
discrimination line.<br>
In yet another aspect, a method for calculating a discrimination criteria for<br>
programming into a test meter for distinguishing between a blood sample and a control<br>
solution sample is provided. In one embodiment, the method can include the steps of (a)<br>
calculating an interferent index and a residual reaction index for a plurality of control<br>
solution samples and (b) calculating a discrimination criteria based on a regression of<br>
the interferent index and the residual reaction index for the plurality of control solution<br>
samples. Optionally, the method can further include the step of plotting an interferent<br>
index and a residual reaction index for a plurality of blood samples and shifting the<br>
discrimination line towards the plurality of blood samples. In one embodiment, the<br>
discrimination criteria is a discrimination line.<br>
In another aspect, a method for distinguishing between a blood sample and a<br>
control solution sample is provided which includes the step of (a) introducing a sample<br>
into an electrochemical cell wherein the cell can include (i) two electrodes in a spaced<br>
apart relationship and (ii) a reagent. The method can further include the steps of (b)<br>
applying a first test potential, having a first polarity, between the electrodes, and<br>
measuring cell current, (c) summing at least two current values measured during the first<br>
test potential to generate an interferent index, and (d) using the interferent index to<br>
distinguish between a blood sample and a control solution sample.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Certain exemplary embodiments will now be described to provide an overall<br>
understanding of the principles of the structure, function, manufacture, and use of the<br>
systems and methods disclosed herein. One or more examples of these embodiments are<br>
illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Those skilled in the art will understand that<br>
the systems and methods specifically described herein and illustrated in the<br>
accompanying drawings are non-limiting exemplary embodiments and that the scope of<br>
the present disclosure is defined solely by the claims. The features illustrated or<br>
described in connection with one exemplary embodiment may be combined with the<br>
features of other embodiments. Such modifications and variations are intended to be<br>
included within the scope of the present disclosure.<br>
The presently disclosed systems and methods are suitable for use in the<br>
determination of a wide variety of analytes in a wide variety of samples, and are<br>
particularly suited for use in the determination of analytes in whole blood or derivatives<br>
thereof, where an analyte of particular interest is glucose. In one aspect, the present<br>
disclosure provides various embodiments of a method for determining whether a sample<br>
applied to a test strip is an aqueous non-blood sample (e.g., a control solution) or a blood<br>
sample. In one such embodiment, at least two characteristics are used to distinguish<br>
between a blood sample and a non-blood sample. This description will focus on<br>
distinguishing between blood samples and control solutions. However, as shown in<br>
Example 2 below, the systems and methods provided herein are equally applicable to<br>
distinguishing blood samples from any of a variety of non-blood samples (e.g.,<br><br>
beverages including sports drinks such as Gatoradeยฎ).<br>
The methods provided herein may be used, in principle, with any type of<br>
electrochemical cell having spaced apart first and second electrodes and a reagent layer.<br>
For example, an electrochemical cell can be in the form of a test strip. In one aspect, the<br>
test strip includes two opposing electrodes separated by a thin spacer layer, where these<br>
components define a sample reaction chamber or zone in which is located a reagent<br>
layer. One skilled in the art will appreciate that other types of test strips, including, for<br>
example, test strips with co-planar electrodes could also be used with the methods<br>
described herein.<br>
FIGS. 1A-4B show various views of an exemplary test strip 62 suitable for use<br>
with the methods described herein. As shown, the test strip 62 can include an elongate<br>
body extending from a proximal end 80 to a distal end 82, and having lateral edges 56,<br>
58. The proximal portion of the body 59 can include a sample reaction chamber 61<br>
having multiple electrodes 164, 166 and a reagent 72, while the distal portion of the test<br>
strip body 59 can include features configured for electrically communicating with a test<br>
meter. In use, physiological fluid or a control solution can be delivered to the sample<br>
reaction chamber 61 for electrochemical analysis.<br>
In the illustrative embodiment, the test strip 62 can include a first electrode layer<br>
66 and a second electrode layer 64, with a spacer layer 60 positioned therebetween. The<br>
first electrode layer 66 can provide a first electrode 166 and a first connection track 76<br>
for electrically connecting the first electrode 166 to a first electrical contact 67.<br>
Similarly, the second electrode layer 64 can provide a second electrode 164 and a<br>
second connection track 78 for electrically connecting the second electrode 164 with a<br>
second electrical contact 63.<br>
In one embodiment, the sample reaction chamber 61 is defined by the first<br>
electrode 166, the second electrode 164, and a spacer 60 as shown in FIGS. 1A-4B.<br>
Specifically, the first electrode 166 and the second electrode 164 define, respectively,<br>
the bottom and top of the sample reaction chamber 61. A cutout area 68 of the spacer 60<br>
can define the side walls of the sample reaction chamber 61. In one aspect, the sample<br>
reaction chamber 61 can further include an number of ports 70 that provide a sample<br>
inlet and/or a vent. For example, one of the ports can provide a fluid sample ingress and<br>
the other port can act as a vent.<br><br>
The sample reaction chamber 61 can have a small volume. For example, the<br>
volume can range from about 0.1 microliters to about 5 microliters, preferably about 0.2<br>
microliters to about 3 microliters, and more preferably about 0.3 microliters to about 1<br>
microliter. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the sample reaction<br>
chamber 61 can have various other such volumes. To provide the small sample volume,<br>
the cutout 68 can have an area ranging from about 0.01 cm2 to about 0.2 cm2, preferably<br>
about 0.02 cm2 to about 0.15 cm2, and more preferably about 0.03 cm2 to about 0.08 cm2.<br>
Similarly, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the volume cutout 68 can be of<br>
various other such areas. In addition, the first and second electrode 166, 164 can be<br>
spaced in the range of about 1 micron to about 500 microns, preferably between about<br>
10 microns and about 400 microns, and more preferably between about 40 microns and<br>
about 200 microns. In other embodiments, such a range can vary between various other<br>
values. The close spacing of the electrodes can also allow redox cycling to occur, where<br>
oxidized mediator generated at the first electrode 166, can diffuse to the second<br>
electrode 164 to become reduced, and subsequently diffuse back to the first electrode<br>
166 to become oxidized again.<br>
At the distal end of the test strip body 59, a first electrical contact 67 can be used<br>
to establish an electrical connection to a test meter. A second electrical contact 63 can<br>
be accessed by the test meter through a U-shaped notch 65 as illustrated in FIG. 2. One<br>
skilled in the art will appreciate that the test strip 62 can include a variety of alternative<br>
electrical contact configured for electrically connecting to a test meter. For example,<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,379,513, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated herein by<br>
reference, discloses an electrochemical cell connection means.<br>
[0001] In one embodiment, the first electrode layer 66 and/or the second electrode layer<br>
64 can be a conductive material formed from materials such as gold, palladium, carbon,<br>
silver, platinum, tin oxide, iridium, indium, and combinations thereof (e.g., indium<br>
doped tin oxide). In addition, the electrodes can be formed by disposing a conductive<br>
material onto an insulating sheet (not shown) by various process such as, for example, a<br>
sputtering, electroless plating, or a screen printing process. In one exemplary<br>
embodiment, the second electrode layer 64 can be a sputtered gold electrode and the first<br>
electrode layer 66 can be a sputtered palladium electrode. Suitable materials that can be<br>
employed as the spacing layer 60 include various insulating materials, such as, for<br><br>
example, plastics (e.g., PET, PETG, polyimide, polycarbonate, polystyrene), silicon,<br>
ceramic, glass, adhesives, and combinations thereof.<br>
A reagent layer 72 can be disposed within the sample reaction chamber 61 using<br>
a process such as slot coating, dispensing from the end of a tube, ink jetting, and screen<br>
printing. Such processes are described, for example, in the following U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
6,749,887; 6,869,411; 6,676,995; and 6,830,934, the entirety of each of these references<br>
being incorporated herein by reference. In one embodiment, the reagent layer 72 can<br>
include at least a mediator and an enzyme, and can be deposited onto the first electrode<br>
166. Various mediators and/or enzymes are within the: spirit and scope of the present<br>
disclosure. For example, suitable mediators include ferricyanide, ferrocene, ferrocene<br>
derivatives, osmium bipyridyl complexes, and quinone derivatives. Examples of<br>
suitable enzymes include glucose oxidase, glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) based on<br>
pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) co-factor, GDH based on nicotinamide adenine<br>
dinucleotide co-factor, and FAD-based GDH [E.C.I .1.99.10]. One exemplary reagent<br>
formulation, which would be suitable for making the reagent layer 72, is described in<br>
pending U.S. Application No. 10/242,951, entitled, "Method of Manufacturing a<br>
Sterilized and Calibrated Biosensor-Based Medical Device", published as U.S.<br>
Published Patent Application No. 2004/0120848, the entirety of which is hereby<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Either the first electrode 166 or the second electrode 164 can function as working<br>
electrode which oxidizes or reduces a limiting amount of mediator depending on the<br>
polarity of the applied test potential of the test meter. For example, if the current<br>
limiting species is a reduced mediator, it can be oxidized at the first electrode 166 as<br>
long as a sufficiently positive potential was applied with respect to the second electrode<br>
164. In such a situation, the first electrode 166 performs the function of the working<br>
electrode and second electrode 164 performs the function of a counter/reference<br>
electrode. It should be noted that unless otherwise stated for test strip 62, all potentials<br>
applied by test meter 100 will hereinafter be stated with respect to second electrode 164.<br>
Similarly, if a sufficiently negative potential is applied with respect to the second<br>
electrode 164, then the reduced mediator can be oxidized at the second electrode 164. In<br>
such a situation, the second electrode 164 can perform the function of the working<br>
electrode and the first electrode 166 can perform the function of the counter/reference<br><br>
electrode.<br>
A first step in an embodiment of the presently disclosed method can include<br>
introducing a quantity of the fluid sample of interest into the test strip 62, which includes<br>
the first electrode 166, the second electrode 164 and a reagent layer 72. The fluid<br>
sample can be whole blood or a derivative or fraction thereof, or a control solution. The<br>
fluid sample, e.g., blood, can be dosed into the sample reaction chamber 61 via the port<br>
70. In one aspect, the port 70 and /or the sample reaction chamber 61 can be configured<br>
such that capillary action causes the fluid sample to fill the sample reaction chamber 61.<br>
FIG. 5 provides a simplified schematic of a test meter 100 interfacing with a first<br>
electrical contact 67 and a second electrical contact 63, which are in electrical<br>
communication with the first electrode 166 and the second electrode 164, respectively,<br>
of the test strip 62. The test meter 100 can be configured to electrically connect to the<br>
first electrode 166 and the second electrode 164 via a first electrical contact 67 and a<br>
second electrical contact 63, respectively (as shown in FIGS. 2 and 5). As will be<br>
appreciated by those skilled in the art, a variety of test meters can be used with the<br>
method described herein. However, in one embodiment, the test meter includes at least<br>
a processor configured for performing calculations capable of discriminating between<br>
blood and a control sample, as well as configured for data sorting and/or storage.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 5, an electrical contact 67 can include two prongs 67a, 67b.<br>
In one exemplary embodiment, the test meter 100 separately connects to the prongs 67a,<br>
67b, such that when the test meter 100 interfaces with a test strip 62 a circuit is<br>
completed. The test meter 100 can measure the resistance or electrical continuity<br>
between the prongs 67a, 67b to determine whether the test strip 62 is electrically<br>
connected to the test meter 100. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the test meter<br>
100 can use a variety of sensors and circuits to determine when the test strip 62 is<br>
properly positioned with respect to the test meter 100.<br>
In one embodiment, test meter 100 can apply a test potential and/or a current<br>
between first electrical contact 67 and second electrical contact 63. Once test meter 100<br>
recognizes that strip 62 has been inserted, test meter 100 turns on and initiates a fluid<br>
detection mode. In one embodiment, the fluid detection mode causes test meter 100 to<br>
apply a constant current of 1 microampere between first electrode 166 and second<br>
electrode 164. Because test strip 62 is initially dry, test meter 100 measures a maximum<br><br>
voltage, which is limited by the hardware within test meter 100. However, once a user<br>
doses a fluid sample onto inlet 70, this causes sample reaction chamber 61 to become<br>
filled. When the fluid sample bridges the gap between first electrode 166 and second<br>
electrode 164, test meter 100 will measure a decrease in measured voltage (e.g., as<br>
described in U.S. Patent No. 6,193,873, the entirety of which being incorporated herein<br>
by reference), which is below a predetermined threshold causing test meter 100 to<br>
automatically initiate the glucose test.<br>
It should be noted that the measured voltage may decrease below a pre-<br>
determined threshold when only a fraction of the sample reaction chamber 61 has been<br>
filled. A method of automatically recognizing that a fluid was applied does not<br>
necessarily indicate that the sample reaction chamber (51 has been completely filled, but<br>
can only confirm a presence of some amount of fluid in the sample reaction chamber 61.<br>
Once the test meter 100 determines that a fluid has been applied to test strip 62, a short,<br>
but non-zero amount of time may still be required to allow the fluid to completely fill<br>
the sample reaction chamber 61.<br>
In one embodiment, once the test meter 100 has determined that a fluid has been<br>
introduced (e.g., dosed) onto the test strip 62, a test meter 100 can perform a glucose test<br>
by applying a plurality of open-circuit potentials and a plurality of test potentials to the<br>
test strip 62 for prescribed intervals as shown in FIG. 6. A glucose test time interval TG<br>
represents an amount of time to perform the glucose test (but not necessarily all the<br>
calculations associated with the glucose test) where the glucose test time interval TG can<br>
include a first open-circuit time interval TOC1, a first test potential time interval T1, a<br>
second open-circuit time interval TOC2, a second test potential time interval T2, and a<br>
third test potential time interval T3. The glucose test time interval TG can range, for<br>
example, from about 1 second to about 5 seconds. While the two open-circuit time<br>
intervals and the three test potential time intervals are described, one skilled in the art<br>
will appreciate that the glucose test time interval can include different numbers of open-<br>
circuit and test potential time intervals. For example, the glucose test time interval could<br>
include a single open-circuit time interval and/or only two test potential time intervals.<br>
Once the glucose assay has been initiated, the test meter 100 switches to a first<br>
open-circuit for a first open-circuit potential time interval TOC1, which in the illustrated<br>
embodiment is about 0.2 seconds. In another embodiment, the first open-circuit time<br><br>
interval TOC1 can be in the range of about 0.05 seconds to about 2 seconds and<br>
preferably between about 0.1 seconds to about 1.0 seconds, and most preferably between<br>
about 0.15 seconds to about 0.6 seconds.<br>
One of the reasons for implementing the first open-circuit is to allow sufficient<br>
time for the sample reaction chamber 61 to fill or partially fill with sample. Typically, at<br>
ambient temperature (i.e., 22 ยฐC), the sample reaction chamber 61 takes about 0.1<br>
seconds to about 0.5 seconds to completely fill with blood. Conversely, at ambient<br>
temperature, the sample reaction chamber 61 takes about 0.2 seconds or less to<br>
completely fill with control solution, where the control solution is formulated to have a<br>
viscosity of about 1 to about 3 centipoise.<br>
While the control solutions are composed of known components and are<br>
generally uniform, blood samples can vary in their make-up and/or composition. For<br>
example, high hematocrit blood samples are more viscous than low hematocrit blood<br>
samples, therefore higher hematocrit blood samples require additional time to fill<br>
compared with lower hematocrit blood samples. Thus, depending on a variety of<br>
factors, blood sample filling time can vary.<br>
After applying the first open-circuit potential, the test meter 100 applies a first<br>
test potential E1 between the first electrode 166 and the second electrode 164 (e.g., -0.3<br>
Volts in FIG. 6), for a first test potential time interval T1 (e.g., 0.15 seconds in FIG. 6).<br>
The test meter 100 measures the resulting first current transient, which can be referred to<br>
as ia(t) as shown in FIG. 7. A current transient represents a plurality of current values<br>
measured by a test meter during a particular test potential time interval. In one<br>
embodiment, the first test potential time interval T1 can be in the range of about 0.05<br>
seconds to about 1.0 second and preferably between about 0.1 seconds to about 0.5<br>
seconds, and most preferably between about 0.1 seconds to about 0.2 seconds. In other<br>
embodiments, the first test potential time interval T1 can include any other desired time<br>
ranges.<br>
As discussed below, a portion or all of the first current transient can be used in<br>
the methods described herein to determine whether a control solution or a blood sample<br>
was applied to the test strip 62. The magnitude of the first transient current is effected<br>
by the presence of easily oxidizable substances in the sample. Blood usually contains<br>
endogenous and exogenous compounds that are easily oxidized at second electrode 164.<br><br>
Conversely, the control solution can be formulated such that it does not contain<br>
oxidizable compounds. However, blood sample composition can vary and the<br>
magnitude of the first current transient for high viscosity blood samples will typically be<br>
smaller than low viscosity samples (in some cases even less than the control solution<br>
samples) because the sample reaction chamber 61 may be not be completely filled after<br>
about 0.2 seconds. An incomplete fill will cause the effective area of the first electrode<br>
166 and the second electrode 164 to decrease which in turn can cause the first current<br>
transient to decrease. Thus, the presence of oxidizable substances in a sample, by itself,<br>
is not always a sufficient discriminatory factor because of variations in blood samples.<br>
After the test meter 100 stops applying the first test potential E1, it can be<br>
configured to switch to a second open-circuit for a second open-circuit time interval<br>
TOC2, which in the example of FIG. 6, is about 0.65 seconds. In another embodiment, a<br>
second open-circuit time interval TOC2 can be in the range of about 0.1 seconds to about<br>
2.0 seconds and preferably between about 0.3 seconds; to about 1.5 seconds, and most<br>
preferably between about 0.5 seconds to about 1.0 seconds. In other embodiments, the<br>
second open-circuit time interval TOC2 can be any other time interval as desired.<br>
One of the reasons for implementing the second open-circuit is to provide<br>
sufficient time for the sample reaction chamber 61 to completely fill, to allow the<br>
reagent layer 72 to dissolve, and to allow a reduced mediator and an oxidized mediator<br>
to re-equilibrate at the respective first electrode 166 and second electrode 164 from the<br>
perturbation caused by the first test potential E1. Although the sample reaction chamber<br>
61 typically fills rapidly, the second open-circuit time interval TOC2 can be sufficiently<br>
long to account for conditions which can cause the fill times to increase such as low<br>
ambient temperature (e.g., about 5 ยฐC) and high hematocrit levels (e.g., &gt;60%<br>
hematocrit).<br>
During the first test potential E1, a reduced mediator can be depleted at the<br>
second electrode 164 and can be generated at the first electrode 166 to form a<br>
concentration gradient. The second open-circuit potential provides time for the reduced<br>
mediator concentration profile to become closer to the state immediately before first test<br>
potential E1 was applied. As will be described below, a sufficiently long second open-<br>
circuit potential is useful because it can allow for glucose concentration to be calculated<br>
in the presence of interferents.<br><br>
An alternative embodiment test potential E1' can be applied between the<br>
electrodes for a duration between when the meter can detect that the strip is filling with<br>
sample and before a second test potential E2 is applied. In one aspect, the test potential<br>
E1' is small. For example, the potential can be between about -1 to about -100 mV,<br>
preferably between about -5 mV and about -50 mV and most preferably between about -<br>
10 mV and about -30 mV. The smaller potential perturbs the reduced mediator<br>
concentration gradient to a lesser extent compared to applying a larger potential<br>
difference, but is still sufficient to obtain a measure of the oxidizable substances in the<br>
sample. The test potential E1' can be applied for a portion of the time between detection<br>
of fill and when the second test potential E2 is applied or can be applied for the whole of<br>
that time period. If the test potential E1' is to be used for a portion of the time then an<br>
open-circuit could be applied for the remaining portion of the time. The combination of<br>
any number of open-circuit and small voltage potential applications, their order and<br>
times applied is not critical in this embodiment, can be applied as long as the total period<br>
for which the small potential E1' is applied is sufficient to obtain a current measurement<br>
indicative of the presence and/or quantity of oxidizable substances present in the sample.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the small potential E1' is applied for substantially the entire<br>
period between when a fill is detected and when the second test potential E2 is applied.<br>
Once the second open-circuit time interval TOC2 or an equivalent time in the<br>
small potential E1' embodiment has elapsed, the test meter 100 can apply a second test<br>
potential E2 between the first electrode 166 and the second electrode 164 for a second<br>
test potential time interval T2. During the second test potential time interval T2, the test<br>
meter 100 can measure a second current transient ib(t). After the second potential time<br>
interval T2 has elapsed, the test meter 100 can apply a third test potential E3 between the<br>
first electrode 166 and the second electrode 164 for a third test potential time interval T3,<br>
which may be referred to as ic(t). The second test potential time interval T2 and the third<br>
test potential time interval T3 can each range from about 0.1 seconds to about 4 seconds.<br>
For the embodiment shown in FIG. 6, the second test potential time interval T2 was<br>
about 3 seconds and the third test potential time interval T3 was about 1 second. As<br>
mentioned above, an open circuit potential time period can be allowed to elapse between<br>
the second test potential E2 and the third test potential E3. Alternatively, the third test<br>
potential E3 can be applied following the application of the second test potential E2.<br><br>
Note that a portion of the first, second, or third current transient may be generally<br>
referred to as a cell current or a current value.<br>
In one embodiment, the first test potential E1 and the second test potential E2<br>
both have a first polarity, and the third test potential E3 has a second polarity, which is<br>
opposite to the first polarity. However, one skilled in the art will appreciate that the<br>
polarity of the first, second, and third test potentials can be chosen depending on the<br>
manner in which analyte concentration is determined and/or depending on the manner in<br>
which the test samples and control solutions are distinguished.<br>
The first test potential E1 and the second test potential E2 can be sufficiently<br>
negative in magnitude with respect to the second electrode 164 such that the second<br>
electrode 164 functions as a working electrode in which a limiting oxidation current is<br>
measured. Conversely, the third test potential E3 can be sufficiently positive in<br>
magnitude with respect to the second electrode 164 such that the first electrode 166<br>
functions as a working electrode in which a limiting oxidation current is measured. A<br>
limiting oxidation occurs when all the oxidizable species have been locally depleted at<br>
the working electrode surface such that the measured oxidation current is proportional to<br>
the flux of oxidizable species diffusing from the bulk solution towards the working<br>
electrode surface. The term bulk solution refers to a portion of the solution sufficiently<br>
far away from the working electrode where the oxidizable species was not located<br>
within the depletion zone. The first test potential E1, the second test potential E2, and<br>
the third test potential E3 can range from about -0.6 Volts to about +0.6 Volts (with<br>
respect to the second electrode 164) when using either a sputtered gold or palladium<br>
working electrode and a ferricyanide mediator.<br>
FIG. 7 shows first, second, and third current transients generated by a test meter<br>
100 and a test strip 62 using either a control solution sample (dotted line) or a blood<br>
sample (solid line). The control solution sample contained a 525 mg/dL glucose<br>
concentration and the blood sample contained a 530 mg/dL glucose concentration with<br>
about 25% hematocrit. FIG. 8 shows an expanded view of first and second current<br>
transients in FIG. 7. FIGS. 7 and 8 show the resulting current transients when applying<br>
the potential waveform shown in FIG. 6. The description below details how the current<br>
transients can be converted into an accurate glucose measurement for the test solution or<br>
control solution.<br><br>
As illustrated in FIG. 12, the test meter 100 can perform a glucose test by<br>
applying a plurality of test potentials for prescribed intervals. The plurality of test<br>
potentials may include a first test potential E1' for a first test potential time interval T1, a<br>
second test potential E2 for a second test potential time interval T2, and a third test<br>
potential E3 for a third test potential time interval T3. The plurality of test current values<br>
measured during the first, second, and third test potential time intervals may be<br>
performed at a frequency ranging from about 1 measurement per nanosecond to about<br>
one measurement per 100 milliseconds. One skilled in the art will appreciate that names<br>
"first," "second," and "third" are chosen for convenience and do not necessarily reflect<br>
the order in which the test potentials are applied.<br>
Once the glucose assay has been initiated using the test potential waveform of<br>
FIG. 12, the test meter 100 may apply a first test potential E|' (e.g., -20 mV) for a first<br>
test potential time interval T1 (e.g., between about 0 and about 1 second). The first test<br>
potential time interval T1 can range from about 0.1 seconds to about 3 seconds and<br>
preferably range from about 0.2 seconds to about 2 seconds, and most preferably range<br>
from about 0.3 seconds to about 1 seconds. The first test potential time interval T1 may<br>
be sufficiently long so that the sample reaction chamber 61 can fully fill with sample<br>
and also so that the reagent layer 72 can at least partially dissolve or solvate. In one<br>
aspect, the first test potential E1' may be a value relatively close to the redox potential of<br>
the mediator so that a relatively small amount of a reduction or oxidation current is<br>
measured. FIG. 13 shows that a relatively small amount of current may be observed<br>
during the first test potential time interval compared to during the second and third test<br>
potential time intervals. For example, when using ferricyanide and/or ferrocyanide as<br>
the mediator, the first test potential E1' can range from about -100 mV to about -1 mV,<br>
preferably range from about -50 mV to about -5 mV, and most preferably range from<br>
about -30 mV to about -10 mV.<br>
After applying the first test potential E1', the test meter 100 can apply a second<br>
test potential E2 between the first electrode 166 and the second electrode 164 (e.g., about<br>
-0.3 Volts as illustrated in FIG. 12), for a second test potential time interval T2 (e.g.,<br>
about 3 seconds as illustrated in FIG. 12). The second test potential E2 may be a value<br>
sufficiently negative of the mediator redox potential so that a limiting oxidation current<br>
occurs at the second electrode 164. For example, when using ferricyanide and/or<br><br>
ferrocyanide as the mediator, the second test potential E2 can range from about -600 mV<br>
to about zero mV, preferably range from about -600 mV to about -100 mV, and more<br>
preferably be about -300 mV.<br>
The second test potential time interval T2 may be sufficiently long to monitor the<br>
rate of generation of reduced mediator (e.g., ferrocyanide) in the sample reaction<br>
chamber 61 based on the magnitude of a limiting oxidation current. The reduced<br>
mediator may be generated by a series of chemical reactions in the reagent layer 72.<br>
During the second test potential time interval T2, a limiting amount of reduced mediator<br>
is oxidized at the second electrode 164 and a non-limiting amount of oxidized mediator<br>
is reduced at the first electrode 166 to form a concentration gradient between the first<br>
electrode 166 and the second electrode 164. As will be described, the second test<br>
potential time interval T2 should be sufficiently long so that a sufficient amount of<br>
ferricyanide can be generated at the second electrode 164. A sufficient amount of<br>
ferricyanide may be required at the second electrode 164 so that a limiting current can<br>
be measured for oxidizing ferrocyanide at the first electrode 166 during the third test<br>
potential E3. The second test potential time interval T2 can range from about 0 seconds<br>
to about 60 seconds and preferably range from about 1 second to about 10 seconds, and<br>
most preferably range from about 2 seconds to about 5 seconds.<br>
FIG. 13 shows a relatively small peak at the beginning of the second test<br>
potential time interval T2 followed by a gradual increase of an absolute value of an<br>
oxidation current during the second test potential time interval (e.g., between about 1<br>
second to about 4 seconds). The small peak occurs due to an initial depletion of reduced<br>
mediator at about 1 second. The gradual increase in oxidation current is ascribed to the<br>
generation of ferrocyanide by reagent layer 72 followed by its diffusion to the second<br>
electrode 164.<br>
After applying the second test potential E2, the test meter 100 can apply a third<br>
test potential E3 between the first electrode 166 and the second electrode 164 (e.g., +0.3<br>
Volts in FIG. 12), for a third test potential time interval T3 (e.g., between about 4 to<br>
about 5 seconds as illustrated in FIG. 12). The third test potential E3 may be a value<br>
sufficiently positive of the mediator redox potential so that a limiting oxidation current<br>
is measured at the first electrode 166. For example, when using ferricyanide and/or<br>
ferrocyanide as the mediator, the third test potential E3 can range from about zero mV to<br><br>
about 600 mV, preferably range from about 100 mV to about 600 mV, and more<br>
preferably be about 300 mV.<br>
The third test potential time interval T3 may be sufficiently long to monitor the<br>
diffusion of a reduced mediator (e.g., ferrocyanide) near the first electrode 166 based on<br>
the magnitude of the oxidation current. During the third test potential time interval T3, a<br>
limiting amount of reduced mediator is oxidized at the first electrode 166 and a non-<br>
limiting amount of oxidized mediator is reduced at the second electrode 164. The third<br>
test potential time interval T3 can range from about 0.1 seconds to about 5 seconds and<br>
preferably range from about 0.3 seconds to about 3 seconds, and most preferably range<br>
from about 0.5 seconds to about 2 seconds.<br>
FIG. 13 shows a relatively large peak at the beginning of the third test potential<br>
time interval T3 followed by a decrease to a steady-state current. In one embodiment,<br>
the second test potential E2 may have a first polarity and third test potential E3 may have<br>
a second polarity that is opposite to the first polarity. However, one skilled in the art<br>
will appreciate that the polarity of the second and third test potentials can be chosen<br>
depending on the manner in which analyte concentration is determined.<br>
Assuming that a test strip has an opposing face or facing arrangement as shown<br>
in FIGS. 1A-4B, and that a potential waveform is applied to the test strip as shown in<br>
FIG. 6, a glucose concentration can be calculated using a glucose algorithm as shown in<br>
Equation (Eq.) 1:<br><br>
In Eq. 1, [G] is the glucose concentration, i\ is a first current value, i2 is a second<br>
current value, and i3 is a third current value, and the terras p, Z, and a are empirically<br>
derived calibration constants. A derivation of Eq. 1 can be found in a pending U.S.<br>
Published Patent Application No. 2007/0074977 (U.S. Application Ser. No.<br>
11/240,797), filed on September 30, 2005 and entitled "Method and Apparatus for Rapid<br>
Electrochemical Analysis," the entirety of which is hereby incorporated herein by<br>
reference. The first current value i\ and the second current value i2 are calculated from<br>
the third current transient and the third current value i3 is calculated from the second<br><br>
current transient. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the names "first," "second,"<br>
and "third" are chosen for convenience and do not necessarily reflect the order in which<br>
the current values are calculated. In addition, all current values (e.g., i1, i2, and i3) stated<br>
in Eq. 1 use the absolute value of the current.<br>
In another embodiment, the term i1 can be defined to include peak current values<br>
from the second and third current transients to allow for more accurate glucose<br>
concentrations in the presence of interferents as shown in Eq. 2:<br><br>
The term iPb represents a peak current value for the second test potential time<br>
interval T2 and the term ipc represents a peak current value for the third test potential<br>
time interval T3. The term iss is an estimate of the steady-state current, which is the<br>
current predicted to occur at long times after the application of the third test potential E3<br>
in the absence of on-going chemical reactions. Where: Eq. 2 is used, the second open-<br>
circuit potential time interval TOC2 is preferably sufficiently long so as to allow Eq. 2 to<br>
compensate for the presence of interferents. When the second open-circuit potential<br>
time interval TOC2 is too short, the second peak current value ipb can become distorted<br>
and can reduce the effectiveness of the interferent correction calculations. The use of<br>
peak current values to account for interferents in a physiological sample are described in<br>

No. 11/278,341), filed on March 31, 2006 and entitled "Methods and Apparatus for<br>
Analyzing a Sample in the Presence of Interferents," the entirety of which is hereby<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In one embodiment, Eq. 1 and Eq. 2 can be used together to calculate a glucose<br>
concentration for either blood or a control solution. In another embodiment, the<br>
algorithm of Eq. 1 and Eq. 2 can be used for blood with a first set of calibration factors<br>
(i.e. a,p, and Z) and a second set of calibration factors can be used for the control<br>
solution. When using two different sets of calibration factors, the methods described<br>
herein for discriminating between a test fluid and a control solution can improve the<br>
effectiveness of the analyte concentration calculations.<br><br>
In addition, if the test meter determines that the sample is control solution (as<br>
opposed to blood), the test meter can store the resulting glucose concentration of the<br>
control sample such that a user can review test sample concentration data separately<br>
from control solution data. For example, the glucose concentrations for control<br>
solutions can be stored in a separate database, can be flagged, and/or discarded (i.e., not<br>
stored or stored for a short period of time).<br>
Another advantage of being able to recognize a control solution is that a test<br>
meter can be programmed to automatically compare the results (e.g., glucose<br>
concentration) of the test of the control solution with the expected glucose concentration<br>
of the control solution. For example, the test meter can be pre-programmed with the<br>
expected glucose level(s) for the control solution(s). Alternatively, a user could input<br>
the expected glucose concentration for the control solution. When the test meter<br>
recognizes a control solution, the test meter can compare the measured control solution<br>
glucose concentration with the expected glucose concentration to determine if the meter<br>
is functioning properly. If the measured glucose concentration is out of the expected<br>
range, the test meter can output a warning message to alert the user.<br>
In one embodiment, the method described herein uses the presence of redox<br>
species to distinguish a control solution from a blood sample. The method can include<br>
the step of applying a first test potential E1' and using one or more current values<br>
measured during the test potential as a discriminator. In one aspect, two current values<br>
from the first test potential E1' are summed and used as the discriminator. FIG. 8 shows<br>
data for a control solution, plasma, a blood sample with 48% hematocrit, and a blood<br>
sample with 77% hematocrit. A potential of about 20 mV was applied for the first 1<br>
second and current values at about 0.2 to about 0.5 seconds were summed. As shown in<br>
FIG. 8, the summed current values were sufficient to distinguish between a control<br>
solution (that was substantially devoid of interferents) mid blood samples.<br>
In another embodiment, two characteristics of control solution are used to<br>
distinguish control solutions from blood - the presence and/or concentration of redox<br>
species in the sample and reaction kinetics. The method disclosed herein can include the<br>
step of calculating a first reference value that is representative of the redox concentration<br>
in the sample and a second reference value that is representative of the rate of reaction of<br>
the sample with the reagent. In one embodiment, the first reference value is an<br><br>
interferent oxidation current and the second reference value is a reaction completion<br>
percentage.<br>
In regard to redox species in the sample, blood usually contains various<br>
endogenous redox species or "interferents" such as ascorbic acid and uric acid, as well<br>
as exogenously derived interferents such as gentisic acid (gentisic acid is a metabolite of<br>
aspirin). Endogenous interferents are chemical species that can be easily oxidized at an<br>
electrode and are usually present in blood within a physiological range for healthy<br>
individuals. Exogenously derived interferents are also a chemical species that can be<br>
easily oxidized at an electrode, but are not usually present in blood unless they are<br>
inputted into the body via consumption, injection, absorption, and the like.<br>
A control solution can be formulated to be either essentially free of antioxidants<br>
or to have a relatively high interferent concentration compared to the interferent<br>
concentration in a blood sample. For the case in which the control solution is essentially<br>
free of antioxidants, the magnitude of the first current transient should be smaller for the<br>
control solution than for a blood sample as shown in FIG. 9. For the case in which the<br>
control solution has a relatively high concentration of interferents, the magnitude of the<br>
first current transient should be larger for the control solution than for a blood sample<br>
(data not shown).<br>
A first reference value can be calculated based on the current values within the<br>
first current transient. In one embodiment, the first reference value can include a<br>
summation of current values at two points in time during the first current transient. In<br>
one example, the current values at about 0.3 and about 0.35 seconds can be used when<br>
employing the test potential waveform of FIG. 6. In another embodiment when a test<br>
potential E1' is applied for the entire period between when fill is detected and the second<br>
test potential E2, the first reference value is preferably obtained by summing two values<br>
over a longer period, for example about 0.2 seconds to about 0.5 seconds. In yet another<br>
embodiment, the first reference value can be obtained by a summation of the current<br>
values obtained during the first time current transient when using the test potential<br>
waveform of FIG. 12. As an example, the summation can be represented by Eq. 3:<br><br><br>
The terms isum is the summation of current values and t is a time.<br>
The first reference value can be referred to as an interferent index because it is<br>
proportional to the interferent concentration and should not substantially depend on the<br>
glucose concentration. Therefore, in theory, the test meter should be able to distinguish<br>
whether the sample is blood or control solution based on the interferent index.<br>
However, in practice, using only the interferent index did not always sufficiently<br>
discriminate between blood and the control solution. Although blood typically has a<br>
much higher interferent concentration, there are certain conditions in which the first<br>
current transient for blood may be attenuated such that it is comparable to control<br>
solution. These conditions include high glucose concentration, high hematocrit, low<br>
temperature, and incomplete filling of the sample reaction chamber 61. Thus, in one<br>
embodiment, an additional factor was implemented to enable the test meter to<br>
sufficiently discriminate between blood and control solution.<br>
The additional factor used for helping discriminate between blood and control<br>
solution can be a second reference value. The second reference value may be referred to<br>
as a residual reaction index, which can be a value which is a function of the percent of<br>
remaining substrate which would have reacted if given enough time. The residual<br>
reaction index relates to the reaction rate in that a high reaction rate can cause the<br>
substrate to be depleted by the reaction. However, the residual reaction index will also<br>
depend on the initial magnitude of the substrate concentration.<br>
The reagent layer 72 can include glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) based on the<br>
PQQ co-factor and ferricyanide. In another embodiment, the enzyme GDH based on the<br>
PQQ co-factor may be replaced with the enzyme GDH based on the FAD co-factor.<br>
When blood or control solution is dosed into a sample reaction chamber 61, glucose is<br>
oxidized by GDH(ox) and in the process converts GDH(ox) to GDH(red), as shown in Eq. 4<br>
below. Note that GDH(ox) refers to the oxidized state of GDH, and GDH(red) refers to the<br>
reduced state of GDH.<br><br>
Next, GDH(red) is regenerated back to its active oxidized state by ferricyanide (i.e.<br>
oxidized mediator or Fe(CN)63-) as shown in Eq. 5 below. In the process of regenerating<br>
GDH(ox), ferrocyanide (i.e. reduced mediator or Fe(CN)64-) is generated from the<br><br>
reaction as shown in Eq. 5:<br><br>
In general, the rate of glucose consumption based on Eq. 4 and Eq. 5 is faster for<br>
control solution than for blood. Typically, the control solution is less viscous than blood<br>
causing the reaction rate of Eq. 4 and Eq. 5 to be faster for the control solution. Further,<br>
the reaction rate is faster for the control solution because a portion of the glucose present<br>
in the blood sample must diffuse out of the red blood cells to participate in Eq. 4. This<br>
extra step of glucose diffusion out of the red blood cells slows down the reaction rate to<br>
some measurable degree. FIG. 9 shows that the reaction rate for blood is slower than for<br>
control solution as evidenced by the fact that the general absolute slope value (e.g.,<br>
between about 1.2 and about 4 seconds) for the second current transient is less for the<br>
blood sample. Because of the faster reaction rates in the control solution as compared to<br>
blood, the residual reaction index for control solution will generally be lower than for<br>
blood.<br>
The residual reaction index can be a number that is related to the percent of<br>
glucose that has not been consumed. In one embodiment, a relatively low residual<br>
reaction index can indicate that the reactions of Eq. 4 and Eq. 5 are close to completion.<br>
In contrast, a relatively high residual reaction index will indicate that the reaction is not<br>
close to completion. For example, the residual reaction index can be an absolute ratio of<br>
a current value of a third current transient divided by a current value of the second<br>
current transient, as shown in Eq. 6:<br><br>
For the denominator of Eq. 6, the current value at 3.8 seconds for the second<br>
current transient was used. The time of 3.8 seconds was chosen empirically, however,<br>
one skilled in the art will appreciate that other current values can be used. In one<br>
embodiment, a current value at about the end of the second current transient is chosen.<br>
During the second test potential time interval T2, the reduced mediator is oxidized at the<br>
second electrode 164. The magnitude of the current values measured during second test<br><br>
potential time interval T2 can be ascribed to the amount of ferrocyanide generated by<br>
reagent layer 72 at the first electrode 166 and then diffused to the second electrode 164.<br>
It is assumed that the reagent layer 72 remains close to the first electrode 166 after it<br>
dissolves in blood. As a result, most of the ferrocyanide that is oxidized by the second<br>
electrode 164 necessarily had to diffuse from first electrode 166.<br>
For the numerator of Eq. 6, the current value at about 4.15 seconds was used.<br>
Other current values from the third current transient can be chosen, however current<br>
value at about the beginning of the third current transient are preferred. During the third<br>
test potential time interval T3, the reduced mediator is oxidized at first electrode 166.<br>
The magnitude of the current values measured during the second test potential time<br>
interval T2 can be ascribed to the amount of ferrocyanide generated by the reagent layer<br>
72 at the first electrode 166 and did not diffuse sufficiently far away from the first<br>
electrode 166. As a result of the reagent layer 72 remaining close to the first electrode<br>
166, the magnitude of the current values for the third current transient will be generally<br>
larger than the second current transient. In addition, the third current transient will also<br>
be larger in magnitude than second current transient because the reagent layer 72 will<br>
have had more time to generate ferrocyanide. Thus, the absolute ratio as shown in Eq. 6<br>
will be larger if the glucose reaction is still far from completion at the time of the<br>
measurement.<br>
In another embodiment, a residual reaction index can be used, as shown in Eq. 7<br>
below. The residual reaction index can increase to indicate that the reactions of Eq. 4<br>
and Eq. 5 are closer to completion and decrease to indicate that the reactions are further<br>
from completion. It should be noted that Eq. 6 has a residual reaction index that ranges<br>
from about 1 to infinity and that Eq. 7 has a residual reaction index that ranges from<br>
about zero to about 1. Under certain circumstances, Eq, 7 may be a better discriminator<br>
for control solution than Eq. 6. For example, the residual reaction index can be an<br>
absolute ratio of a current value of second current transient divided by a current value of<br>
the third current transient, as shown in Eq. 7:<br><br><br>
FIG. 10 is a chart showing a non-linear relationship between the estimated<br>
percent (%) of substrate consumed and the residual reaction index of Eq. 6 for blood<br>
samples having various hematocrit levels and for control solution (diamonds = 25%<br>
hematocrit blood, squares = 42% blood, triangles = 60% hematocrit blood, x = control<br>
solution). FIG. 10 illustrates that the residual reaction index is relatively high when the<br>
% of substrate consumed is low and that the residual reaction index is relatively low<br>
when the % of substrate consumed is high for a given sample type/hematocrit value.<br><br>
substrate concentration at the electrode surface and YSI is the substrate concentration<br>
using a standard reference technique. The term Co is derived using the following Eq. 8:<br><br>
In this equation, L is the distance between the first electrode 166 and the second<br>
electrode 164, F is Faraday's constant, A is the area of first electrode 166, and D is the<br>
diffusion coefficient. Further details regarding Eq. 8 can be found in U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,284,125, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIG. 11 is a chart showing a relationship between the interferent index and a<br>
residual reaction index for a plurality of blood samples and control solution samples. By<br>
plotting the interferent index on the X-axis and the residual reaction index on the Y-axis,<br>
a segregation between blood and control solution can be observed. A discrimination line<br>
can be drawn to determine if the sample is either a control solution or blood. In this<br>
embodiment, the interferent index is i(0.3) + i(0.35) and the residual reaction index is<br><br>
It should be noted that the times (e.g., 4.15, 3.8) at which the current values were<br>
selected for the residual reaction index, were found empirically. A large number of<br>
current ratios were evaluated for their ability to discriminate between blood and control<br>
solution samples. The ratio shown in either Eq. 6 or Eq. 7 was selected because it was<br>
found to produce significant separation between blood and control solution samples.<br><br>
A discrimination line was derived to allow the test meter to determine whether<br>
the sample was a control solution or blood. For all of the control solution samples<br>
tested, the interferent index was plotted versus the residual reaction index. Next, a line<br>
was calculated using linear regression for control solution samples. After calculating an<br>
equation for the line, the perpendicular bias between each data point and the line was<br>
calculated. The perpendicular bias represents the shortest distance between the data<br>
point and the line as opposed to a vertical bias that is commonly calculated. A standard<br>
deviation was determined for all of the perpendicular biases (SDperp). Lastly, the line<br>
was shifted 3* SDperp units towards the data points for the blood group. The reason for<br>
this approach is that the data for the control solution group show very little scatter and<br>
therefore the "99% confidence limit" of the control solution group is well-defined.<br>
In the method described herein, the information obtained from this statistical<br>
analysis of the residual reaction index and the interferent index can be used by the test<br>
meter to distinguish a control solutions from blood samples. The test meter can<br>
calculate the interferent index and residual reaction index and use these values in<br>
association with the derived discrimination line (or an equation representing the<br>
discrimination line) to distinguish control solutions from blood samples.<br>
For the situation in which the test potential waveform of FIG. 12 is employed, an<br>
alternative algorithm for discriminating between control solution and blood may be<br>
used. The alternative algorithm includes using the interferent index of Eq. 3 and the<br>
residual reaction index of Eq. 7. FIG. 14 illustrates a chart showing the relationship<br>
between the interferent index and a residual reaction index for a plurality of blood<br>
samples and control solution samples using the alternative algorithm. In FIG. 14, blood<br>
samples and control solution samples were tested over a temperature range of about 5<br>
degrees Celsius to about 45 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the blood samples had a<br>
glucose concentration range of about 20 mg/dL to about 560 mg/dL and a hematocrit<br>
level range of 0% to about 60%. FIG 15 illustrates another chart where more test strips<br>
(about 27,400) were tested using the alternative algorithm at room temperature only. By<br>
plotting the interferent index on the X-axis and the residual reaction index on the Y-axis,<br>
a segregation between blood and control solution can be observed in FIGS. 14 and 15.<br>
A discrimination criterion can be used to determine if the sample is either control<br>
solution or blood based on the interferent index of Eq. 3 and the residual reaction index<br><br>
of Eq. 7. For example, the interferent index of Eq. 3 may be compared to a pre-<br>
determined threshold and the residual reaction index of Eq. 7 may be compared to a pre-<br>
determined threshold equation. The pre-determined threshold may be about 10<br>
microamperes. The pre-determined threshold equation may be based on function using<br>
the interferent index. More specifically, the pre-determined threshold equation can be<br>
Eq. 9.<br><br>
The term K can be a constant such as, for example, about 0.2. Thus, the<br><br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1:<br>
The following provides the preparation of the control solution which was utilized<br>
to generate the data of FIGS. 7 and 11. This preparation is non-limiting as various other<br>
preparations and/or control solutions can be utilized with the currently disclosed system<br>
and method.<br>
Citraconic acid Buffer Component 0.0833 g<br>
Dipotassium citraconate Buffer Component 1.931 g<br>
Methyl Paraben Preservative 0.050 g<br>
Germal II Preservative 0.400 g<br>
Dextran T-500 Viscosity Modifier 3.000 g<br>
Pluronic 25R2 Wicking Agent 0.050 g<br>
1-[(6-methoxy-4-sulfo-m-tolyl)azo]-2-naphthol-6-sulfonic acid disodium salt<br>
Dye (FD&amp;C Blue No. 1) 0.100 g<br><br>
D-Glucose Analyte 50, 120, or 525 mg<br>
Deionized Water Solvent 100 g<br>
First citraconic buffer pH 6.5ยฑ0.1 was prepared by dissolving required quantities<br>
of citraconic acid and dipotassium citraconate in deionized water. Next, methyl paraben<br>
was added and the solution was stirred until the preservative was fully dissolved.<br>
Subsequently Dextran T-500, Germal II, Pluronic 25R2 and l-[(6- methoxy-4-sulfo-m-<br>
tolyl)azo]-2-naphthol-6-sulfonic acid disodium salt were added sequentially, following<br>
complete dissolution of the previously added chemical. At this point, the pH of the<br>
control fluid was verified, followed by addition of the requisite quantity of glucose to<br>
obtain a low, normal or high glucose level of the control fluid. After the glucose was<br>
dissolved completely, the control fluid was left at room temperature overnight. Finally,<br>
the glucose concentration was verified using a Model 2700 Select Biochemistry<br>
Analyzer manufactured by Yellow Springs Instrument Co., Inc. The dye used in this<br>
control solution has a blue color, which reduces the possibility of a user confusing the<br>
control solution with blood.<br>
Example 2:<br>
Some people (e.g., young people attempting to deceive parents or doctors) will<br>
load a sensor with Gatoradeยฎ as opposed to blood to give the impression that their<br>
glucose is under control. The following experiment was performed to determine if the<br>
currently disclosed method and sensor could be utilized to distinguish Gatoradeยฎ from<br>
blood.<br>
Five (5) different flavors of Gatoradeยฎ were tested. The sensor classified all 5<br>
flavors as a control solution (mean glucose = 264 mg/dL; CV = 6.7%). Thus, the sensor<br>
can be used to distinguish between Gatoradeยฎ and blood.<br>
