TITLE OF INVENTION<br>
"IMPROVED PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF THIAZOLIDINEDIONE<br>
DERIVATIVES"<br>
Themis Laboratories Private Limited, a company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956 and having its corporate office Unit No. S-4, Khira Industrial Estate, B. M. Bhargava Road, Santacruz (West), Mumbai - 400 054, Maharashtra State, India an Indian Company<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br>
Field of Invention<br>
The present invention provides a novel method for preparation of Thiazolidinedione derivatives including pioglitazone, cglitazone, englitazone and rosiglitazone and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The preparation of thiazolidinedione derivative especially pioglitazone hydrochloride is described in various publications and patents. A brief discussion of the relevant prior art is given below.<br>
Y. Momose et al in Chem. Pharm. Bull; 39, 1440, (1991), K. Meguro et al. in the Japanese Patent No., 139182 and the article in Chem. Abstr. 109: 6504h, (1988) describe a process for making thiazolidinedione derivative including pioglitazone based on Scheme-1<br>
SCHEME-1<br><br><br><br><br><br>
The yields are generally 
D. A. Clark et at., in J. Med Chem 34, 319-325, (1991), describe a process for making substituted dihydropyran and dihydrobenzofuran thiazolidinedione including Englitazone. This reaction process involves reduction of double bond using palladium on carbon in acetic acid as solvent. The reaction gives low yield of pioglitazone in pure form (
2<br><br>
K. Meguro et al., in U. S. Pat. No. 4, 687, 777, Sohda. T. et al., in 'Arznecna-Forsch (ARZANAD), 40(1), 37-42 (19910), and the patent EP 193256 describe the synthesis of Pioglitazone as per Scheme-2.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Following Scheme-2, compound represented by formula -7, is prepared by subjecting compound represented by formula-13, to hydrolysis.   This reaction is carried out in a<br>
3<br><br>
solvent using mineral acid. The solvents of choice are alcohols e.g. methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, isobutanol, 2-methoxy ethanol etc, dimethyl sulfoxide, sulfolane, dioxane and tetrahydrofuran, dimethoxy ethane etc., and the mineral acid used are hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, hydrobromic acid, etc. The reaction temperature ranges from 20-150°C with the process taking up to 20 hours. The reaction for producing compound of formula 10 from compound of formula 1 is carried out with sodium hydride and in solvent like dimethyl formamide or tetrahydrofuran at temperatures ranging from -10 to 30°C. The reduction of nitro group is done using palladium on carbon as catalyst. Compound of formula 12 is produced by subjecting compound of formula 11 to diazotization in aqueous solution of hydrobromic acid, then allowing the resultant reaction mixture to react with methyl acrylate to form the a -bromo ester of formula 12 in presence of copper catalysts. Compound of formula 12 needs to be purified by chromatography before subjecting to further reaction. Compound of formula 12 is then allowed to react with thiourea to give compound of formula -13. The reaction is carried out in methanol or isopropanol, at high temperature of around 80-100°C. Compound -12, is generally subjected to hydrolysis without isolation to form Pioglitazone hydrochloride 7.<br>
p-Fluoro nitrobenzene is known to dimerize under the conditions described in the publications. Formation of impurities due to dimerization of fluoro nitrobenzene are difficult to isolate making such processes unattractive.<br>
Other methods for the preparation of derivatives of thiazolidinedione are given in publications JPA-S63 (1988)-139182; EP-A-257781; Chem. Pharm. Bull., 39, 1440, (1991); JP-A H5 (1993)-112483; and EP-A 506273 represented by scheme-3.<br>
SCHEME-3<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
4<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Here 2-(2-pyridyl)ethyl alkane sulfonate compound of formula-8 in Scheme-3 is reacted with p-hydroxy benzaldehyde in a suitable solvent selected from aliphatic halogenated hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, ethers, water, ethyl acetate and dimethyl formamide or in a suitable mixture of them in the present of a base. When the reaction is conducted in non-aqueous organic solvent the reaction takes approximately 25-30h. for completion. Due to p-elimination reaction as the side reaction, 2-vinyl pyridine is produced thereby lowering the yield and purity of the benzaldehyde compound in subsequent reaction steps. If the reaction needs to be conducted in aqueous and nonaqueous solvent, a phase transfer catalyst is required. The formation of thick slurry creates problems of inhomogeneous mixing thereby affecting the yield (as low 50-60%) and purity of the benzaldehyde compound 4. Further the reduction of double bond in the compound of formula 5 in Scheme-3 requires expensive noble metal catalysts, high pressure and high temperature. The process described as per Scheme-3 has serious limitations for industrial application.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6, 100, 403 describes a process where attempt has been made to overcome drawbacks of earlier processes by employing ethanol or isopropanol for the condensation of p-hydroxy benzaldehyde with 5-ethylpyridine-2-ethanol and the subsequent condensation of the aldehyde derivative in toluene or ethyl acetate. This approach significantly reduces the formation of 2-vinyl pyridine. The major draw back in the process described is the reduction of compound of formula - 5 in Scheme-3, viz. 5-[4-[2-(ethyl-2-pyridyl) ethoxy] benzylidene] 2,4-thiazolidinedione using palladium on carbon as catalyst is that it requires hydrogen pressure of 50 kg/cm and temperature of<br>
5<br><br>
110°C for 5 hours for completion of the reduction. The yield obtained is about 66% with substantial quantities of impurities that need extensive purification. The high hydrogen pressures and temperatures used in this reaction make this process unsuitable for effective industrial use.<br>
U. S. Pat. No. 5,585,495 discloses an attempt to circumvent the high-pressure reduction of double bond in compound -5 in Scheme-3 using sodium borohydride, cobalt salts like cobaltous chloride or cobaltous di acetate and dimethyl glyoxime as a ligand meant for complexing their metal ion. The yields in this process are inconsistent. The work up is cumbersome and requires the isolation of cobalt salts. The process has not found favor for industrial use.<br>
Several references disclose cobalt catalyzed reduction of compound 5-[4-(2-(-5-ethyl-2pyridyl ethoxy] benzylidene] 2,4-thiazolidinedione, prepared by the condensation of 5-ethyl pyridine-2-ethanol with p-hydroxy benzaldehyde following Scheme-3. [Ref; U. Leuteneggar., Agnew. Chem Int Ed. Eng., 28:60, 1989, M. Ricroch et al., J. org. met Chem., 67, 119, (1974); J. O. Oshy et a., JACS, 108, 67-72, (1986). These methods have the inherent disadvantage of preparing cobalt complexes of sodium borohydride either with semicorrin, pyridinato cobaloxime, chloro pyridinato cobaloxime or Vitamin B 12. Reductions have also been reported using lithium aluminum hydride.<br>
Drugs of Future., 9, (1991), 16, 9, discloses a multi step process via carbon alkylation for the preparation of thiazolidinedione.<br>
All the processes described in the prior art are cumbersome needing extensive workup with high pressures/temperatures, low yielding, hazardous, expensive and therefore remain unattractive for industrial use.<br>
It has been a long-standing need of the industry to develop industrially viable processes that are cost effective, simple, efficient and safe to implement in the industrial scale.<br>
The present invention i s a step i n the desired direction as it provides method for the preparation of pharmaceutically active compounds, such as thiazolidinedione derivatives including Pioglitazone, Cglitazone, Englitazone and Rosiglitazone etc and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The process as per scheme-4 is described in detail for pioglitazone hydrochloride where R is ethyl (CH2CH3) as a preferred embodiment.<br>
The present invention provides a process for preparing a compound of the formula-10, by reacting 2-(5-ethyl-2-pyridyl) ethyl-p-methyl sulfonate of formula -8, with p-nitro phenol in an organic solvent comprising of any aromatic hydrocarbons e.g. Toluene, xylene or benzene or any aliphatic nitriles like acetonitrile, propionitrile etc or any aprotic solvent like dimethyl formamide or dimethyl sulfoxide, the preferred solvent being aliphatic nitriles, especially acetonitrile. The reaction is carried out in presence of an inorganic base selected from any alkali metal carbonates, bicarbonates like sodium, potassium carbonate or bicarbonate or alkaline earth metal carbonates like calcium carbonate preferably potassium carbonate. The reaction is generally conducted at elevated temperature ranging from about 20 to about 80°C, preferably from about 30 to about 50°C. The compound thus prepared is isolated using aromatic hydrocarbon solvents like toluene, benzene or xylene and purified using an aliphatic solvent selected from pentane, hexane or heptanes and ethers like isopropyl ether or diethyl ether. Resulting in the pure nitro compound without resorting to extensive recrystallization or chromatography.<br>
The compound of formula 10 is converted to compound of formula 11, by reduction of<br>
the nitro group by catalytic hydrogenation using Raney Nickel.  The reduction can also<br>
be carried out using conventional reagents like iron / hydrochloric acid, sodium<br>
10<br><br>
hydrogen sulfide, or even sodium sulfide. The catalyst of choice being Raney Nickel processed from Nickel Aluminum alloy with Ni content of 90-92% and aluminum content of 8-10% and particle sizes of the catalyst from about 150 to about 250 mesh for the controlled reduction of nitro group without affecting the more reactive pyridine ring. The hydrogen pressure is of about 3kg/cm3 to about 5kg/cm3, preferably of about 3kg/cm3 to about 4kg/cm3. The medium for hydrogenation is selected from a range of aliphatic alcohols such as methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, butyl alcohol, etc preferably methanol. The amine thus obtained can be isolated by evaporation of solvent and subjected to subsequent reaction without resorting to exhaustive purification.<br>
Compound of formula 12 is prepared by conventional Meerwein Arylation step, by diazotization of the compound of formula 11 in presence of aqueous hydrogen bromide and allowing the resultant diazo compound to react with acrylic acid or its lower alkyl ester in presence of copper catalyst. The compound thus obtained is purified by preferential extraction and water wash.<br>
Compound of formula 12 is reacted with thiourea in presence of sodium or potassium acetate by any of the generally used methods. The imino thiazolidiene of formula 13 is hydrolyzed to pioglitazone base using any of the mineral acids selected form hydrochloric, sulfuric or even hydrobromic. The quantity of acid used range from about 1M to about 4M, preferably about 2M to about 3M with respect to the pioglitazone base. The base thus obtained is purified to pharmaceutical grade in a variety of solvents starting from DMF/water to other aliphatic solvents like ethyl acetate. The Pioglitazone base thus obtained needs to be converted to its hydrochloride salt in any alcoholic solvents using dry hydrogen chloride.<br>
The process of this invention substitutes the expensive raw materials like p-fluoro nitro benzene or p-fluoro benzo nitrile as described in the prior art for the preparation of the amino compound required for building up the thiazolidinedione ring. The method also avoids cumbersome and difficult reduction of double bond in compounds known by the formula 5 in Scheme 3.<br>
Furthermore, the preparation of other salts of pioglitazone can be achieved by the reaction of compound of formula 13 with various mineral acids like hydrochloric acid,<br>
11<br><br>
sulfuric acid, or organic acids like methane sulfonic acid or maleic acid or fumaric acid etc.<br>
In the case of the organic acids, the thiazolidinone base is taken in an organic solvent such as aliphatic alcohol preferably methanol, ethanol or isopropanol in molar ratio of minimum 1:1 with respect to the thiazolidinone base. The reaction mixture is refluxed to dissolve the thiazolidinone base and the temperature is maintained for 1h then cooled to room temperature and further to about 10°C. The precipitated solid is filtered and washed with an aliphatic alcohol such as isopropyl alcohol and dried at 50°C to obtain thiazolidienedione acid salt as a white solid.<br>
