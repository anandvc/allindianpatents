				<td>β-L-2'-Deoxy-Nucleosides for the Treatment of Hepatitis B<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
This invention is in the area of methods for the treatment of hepatitis B virus (also<br>
referred to as "HB V") that includes administering to a host in need thereof, either alone or in<br>
combination, an effective amount of one or more of the active compounds disclosed herein,<br>
or a pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug or salt of one of these compounds.<br>
HBV is second only to tobacco as a cause of human cancer. The mechanism by<br>
which HBV induces cancer is unknown, although it is postulated that it may directly trigger<br>
tumor development, or indirectly trigger tumor development through chronic inflammation,<br>
cirrhosis, and cell regeneration associated with the infection.<br>
Hepatitis B virus has reached epidemic levels worldwide. After a two to six month<br>
incubation period in which the host is unaware of the infection, HBV infection can lead to<br>
acute hepatitis and liver damage, that causes abdominal pain, jaundice, and elevated blood *<br>
levels of certain enzymes. HBV can cause fulminant hepatitis, a rapidly progressive, often<br>
fatal form of the disease hi which massive sections of the liver are destroyed.<br>
Patients typically recover from acute hepatitis. In some patients, however, high levels<br>
of viral antigen persist in the blood for an extended, or indefinite, period, causing a chronic<br>
infection. Chronic infections can lead to chronic persistent hepatitis. Patients infected with<br>
chronic persistent HBV are most common in developing countries. By mid-1991, there were<br>
approximately 225 million chronic carriers of HBV in Asia alone, and worldwide, almost <br>
million carriers. Chronic persistent hepatitis can cause fatigue, cirrhosis of the liver, and<br>
hepatocellular carcinoma, a primary liver cancer.<br>
In western industrialized countries, high risk groups for HBV infection include those<br>
in contact with HBV carriers or their blood samples. The epidemiology of HBV is very<br>
similar to that of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), which accounts for why<br>
HBV infection is common among patients with AIDS or AIDS related complex. However,<br>
HBV is more contagious than HIV.<br>
However, more recently, vaccines have also been produced through genetic<br>
engineering and are currently used widely. Unfortunately, vaccines cannot help those already<br>
infected with HBV. Daily treatments with a-interferon, a genetically engineered protein, has<br>
also shown promise, but this therapy is only successful in about one third of treated patients.<br>
Further, interferon cannot be given orally.<br>
A number of synthetic nucleosides have been identified which exhibit activity against<br>
HBV. The (-)-enantiomer of BCH-189, known as 3TC, claimed in U. S. Patent 5,539,116 to<br>
Liotta, et al., has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment<br>
of hepatitis B. See also EPA 0 494 119 Al filed by BioChem Pharma, Inc.<br>
Cis-2-hydroxymethyl-5-(5-fluorocytosin-l-yl)-l,3-oxathiolane ("FTC") exhibits<br>
activity against HBV. See WO 92/15308; Furman, et al., "The Anti-Hepatitis B Virus<br>

von Janta-Lipinski et al. disclose the use of the L-enantiomers of 3'-fluoro-modified<br>
-deoxyribonucleoside 5'-triphosphates for the inhibition of hepatitis B polymerases (J.<br>
Med. Chem., 1998,41,2040-2046). Specifically, the 5'-triphosphates of 3'-deoxy-3'-fluoro-_<br>
-L-thymidine (p-L-FTTP), 2',3'-dideoxy-3'-fluoro-p-L-cytidine O-L-FdCTP), and 2',3'-<br>
dideoxy-3'-fluoro-p-L-5-methylcytidine (p-L-FMethCTP) were disclosed as effective<br>
inhibitors of HBV DNA polymerases.<br>
WO 96/13512 to Genencor International, Inc. and Lipitek, Inc. discloses that certain<br>
L-ribofuranosyl nucleosides can be useful for the treatment of cancer and viruses.<br>
Specifically disclosed is the use of this class of compounds for the treatment of cancer and<br>
HIV.<br>
U. S. Patent Nos. 5,565,438,5,567,688 and 5,587,362 (Chu, et al.) disclose the use of<br>
2'-fluoro-5-methyl-p&gt;-L-arabhiofuranolyluridine (L-FMAU) for the treatment of hepatitis <br>
and Epstein Barr virus.<br>
Yale University and University of Georgia Research Foundation, Inc. disclose the use<br>
of L-FddC (p-L-5-fluoro-2',3'-dideoxycytidine) for the treatment of hepatitis B virus in <br>
The synthetic nucleosides p-L-2'-deoxycytidine (p-L-2'-dC), p-L-2'-deoxythymidine<br>
(p-L-dT) and p-L-2'-deoxyadenosine O-L-2'-dA), are known in the art. Antonin Holy first<br>
disclosed p-L-dC and P-L-dT in 1972, "Nucleic Acid Components and Their Analogs. CLIII.<br>
Preparation of 2'-deoxy-L-Ribonucleosides of the Pyrimidine Series," Collect. Czech Chem.<br>
Commun. (1972), 37(12), 4072-87. Morris S. Zedeck et al. first disclosed p-L-dA for the<br>
inhibition of the synthesis of induced enzymes in Pseudomonas testosteroni, Mol. Phys.<br>
(1967), 3(4), 386-95.<br>
Certain 2'-deoxy-p-L-erythro-pentofuranonucleosides are known to have<br>
antineoplastic and selected antiviral activities. Verri et al. disclose the use of 2'-deoxy-p-Lerythro-<br>
pentofuranonucleosides as antineoplastic agents and as anti-herpetic agents (Mol.<br>
Pharmacol. (1997), 51(1), 132-138 and Biochem. J. (1997), 328(1), 317-20). Saneyoshi et al.<br>

Chem. (1967), 10(5), 908-12).<br>
p-L-2'-deoxythymidine (p-L-dT) is known in the art to inhibit herpes simplex virus<br>
type 1 (HSV-1) thymidine kinase (TK). lotti et al., WO 92/08727, teaches that P-L-dT<br>
selectively inhibits the phosphorylation of D-thymidine by HSV-1 TK, but not by human <br>
Spaldari et al. reported that L-thymidine is phosphorylated by herpes simplex virus type 1<br>
thymidine kinase and inhibits viral growth, J. Med. Chem. (1992), 35(22), 4214-20.<br>
In light of the fact that hepatitis B virus has reached epidemic levels worldwide, and<br>
has severe and often tragic effects on the infected patient, there remains a strong need to<br>
provide new effective pharmaceutical agents to treat humans infected with the virus that have<br>
low toxicity to the host<br>
Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide new methods and<br>
compositions for the treatment of human patients or other hosts infected with hepatitis B<br>
virus.<br>

with inorganic acids (for example, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid,<br>
phosphoric acid, nitric acid, and the like), and salts formed with organic acids such as acetic<br>
acid, oxalic acid, tartaric acid, succinic acid, malic acid, ascorbic acid, benzoic acid, tannic .<br>
acid, palmoic acid, alginic acid, polyglutamic acid, naphthalenesulfonic acids,<br>
naphthalenedisulfonic acids, and polygalacturonic acid; (b) base addition salts formed with<br>
cations such as sodium, potassium, zinc, calcium, bismuth, barium, magnesium, aluminum,<br>
copper, cobalt, nickel, cadmium, sodium, potassium, and the like, or with an organic cation<br>
formed from N,N-dibenzylethylene-diamine, ammonium, or ethylenediamine; or (c)<br>
combinations of (a) and (b); e.g., a zinc tannate salt or the like.<br>
The term prodrug, as used herein, refers to a compound that is converted into the<br>
nucleoside on administration in vivo. Nonlimiting examples are pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salts (alternatively referred to as "physiologically acceptable salts"), the 5' and N4 or N6<br>
acylated or alkylated derivatives of the active compound, and the 5'-phospholipid and 5'-<br>
ether lipid derivatives of the active compound.<br>
Modifications of the active compounds, specifically at the N4, N6 and 5'-O positions,<br>
can affect the bioavailability and rate of metabolism of the active species, thus providing<br>
control over the delivery of the active species.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention is a method for the treatment of<br>
HBV infections in humans or other host animals, that includes administering an effective<br>
amount of one or more of a 2'-deoxy-p-L-erythro-pentoruranonucleoside derivative selected<br>
from the group consisting of p-L-2'-deoxyadenosine, p-L-2'-deoxycytidine, deoxyuridine, (J-L-2'-guanosine, p-L-2'-deoxyinosine, and p-L-2'-deoxythymidine, or a<br>
physiologically acceptable prodrug thereof, including a phosphate, 5' and or N6 alkylated or<br>
acylated derivative, or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof, optionally in a<br>
pnarmaceutically acceptable carrier. The compounds of this invention either possess<br>
anti-HBV activity, or are metabolized to a compound or compounds that exhibit anti-HIV<br>
activity. In a preferred embodiment, the 2'-deoxy-p-L-erythro-pentofuranonucleoside is<br>
administered substantially in the form of a single isomer, i.e., at least approximately 95% in<br>
the designated stereoconfiguration.<br>
Nucleotide Prodrugs<br>
Any of the nucleosides described herein can be administered as a stabilized nucleotide<br>
prodrug to increase the activity, bioavailability, stability or otherwise alter the properties of<br>
the nucleoside. A number of nucleotide prodrug ligands are known. In general, alkylation,<br>
acylation or other lipophilic modification of the mono, di or triphosphate of the nucleoside .<br>
will increase the stability of the nucleotide. Examples of substituent groups that can replace<br>
one or more hydrogens on the phosphate moiety are alkyl, aryl, steroids, carbohydrates,<br>
including sugars, 1,2-diacylglycerol and alcohols. Many are described in R. Jones and N.<br>
Bischofberger, Antiviral Research, 27 (1995) 1-17. Any of these can be used in combination<br>
with the disclosed nucleosides to achieve a desired effect.<br>
In one embodiment, the 2'-<leoxy is provided as></leoxy>
5'-hydroxyl lipophilic prodrug. Nonlimiting examples of U.S. patents that disclose suitable<br>
lipophilic substituents that can be covalently incorporated into the nucleoside, preferably at<br>
the 5'-OH position of the nucleoside or lipophilic preparations, include U.S. Patent Nos.<br>

Combination or Alternation Therapy<br>
It has been recognized that drug-resistant variants of HBV can emerge after prolonged<br>
treatment with an antiviral agent. Drug resistance most typically occurs by mutation of a<br>
gene that encodes for an enzyme used in the viral life cycle, and most typically in the case of<br>
HBV, DNA polymerase. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the efficacy of a drug<br>
against HBV infection can be prolonged, augmented, or restored by administering the<br>
compound in combination or alternation with a second, and perhaps third, antiviral compound<br>
that induces a different mutation from that caused by the principle drug. Alternatively, the<br>
pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, or other parameter of the drug can be altered by such<br>
combination or alternation therapy. In general, combination therapy is typically preferred<br>
over alternation therapy because it induces multiple simultaneous stresses on the virus.<br>
The anti-hepatitis B viral activity of p-L-2'-dA, ß-L-2'-dC, 0-L-2'-dU, p-L-2'-dG, 0-<br>
L-2'-dT,-L-dI, or other 0-L-2'-nucleosides provided herein, or the prodrugs, phosphates, or<br>
salts of these compounds, can be enhanced by administering two or more of these nucleosides<br>
in combination or alternation. Alternatively, for example, one or more of {3-L-2'-dA, P-L-2'-<br>
dC, pß-L-2'-dU, ßL-2'-dG, ß-L-2'-dT, -L-dl, or other -L-2'-nucleosides provided herein<br>
can be administered in combination or alternation with 3TC, FTC, L-FMAU, DAPD,<br>
famciclovir, penciclovir, BMS-200475, bis pom PMEA (adefovir, dipivoxil); lobucavir,<br>
ganciclovir, or ribavarin.<br>
In any of the embodiments described herein, if the p-L-2'-nucleoside of the present<br>
invention is administered in combination or alternation with a second nucleoside or<br>
nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor that is phosphorylated to an active form, it is<br>
preferred that a second compound be phosphorylated by an enzyme that is different from that<br>
which phosphorylates the selected j}-L-2'-nucleoside of the present invention in vivo.<br>
Examples of kinase enzymes are thymidine kinase, cytosine kinase, guanosine kinase,<br>
adenosine kinase, deoxycytidine kinase, 5'-nucleotidase, and deoxyguanosine kinase.<br>
Preparation of the Active Compounds<br>
The 2'-deoxy-p-L-erythro-pentofurarionucleoside derivatives of the present invention<br>
are known in the art and can be prepared according to the method disclosed by Holy, Collect.<br>
Czech. Chem. Commun. (1972), 37(12), 4072-87 and Mol Phys. (1967), 3(4), 386-95.<br>
A general process for obtaining p-L-erythro-pentafuranonucleosides (p-L-dN) is<br>
shown in Figure 1, using L-ribose or L-xylose as a starting material.<br>
Mono, di, and triphosphate derivatives of the active nucleosides can be prepared as<br>
described according to published methods. The monophosphate can be prepared according to<br>
the procedure of Imai et al., J. Org. Chem., 34(6), 1547-1550 (June 1969). The diphosphate<br>
can be prepared according to the procedure of Davisson et al., J. Org. Cfaem., 52(9), <br>
1801 (1987). The triphosphate can be prepared according to the procedure of Hoard et al., <br>
Am. Chem. Soc., 87(8), 1785-1788 (1965).<br>
Experimental Protocols<br>
Melting points were determined in open capillary tubes on a Gallenkamp MFB-595-<br>
010 M apparatus and are uncorrected. The UV absorption spectra were recorded on an<br>
Uvikon 931 (KONTRON) spectrophotometer hi ethanol. 'H-NMR spectra were run at room<br>
temperature in DMSQ-dg with a Bruker AC 250 or 400 spectrometer. Chemical shifts are<br>
given in ppm, DMSO-dj being set at 2.49 ppm as reference. Deuterium exchange, decoupling<br>
experiments or 2D-COSY were performed in order to confirm proton assignments. Signal<br>
multiplicities are represented by s (singlet), d (doublet), dd (doublet of doublets), t (triplet), q<br>
(quadruplet), br (broad), m (multiplet). All J-values are hi Hz. FAB mass spectra were<br>
recorded in the positive- (FAB&gt;0) or negative- (FAB
spectrometer The matrix was 3-nitrobenzyl alcohol (NBA) or a mixture (50:50, v/v) of<br>
glycerol and thioglycerol (GT). Specific rotations were measured on a Perkin-Elmer 241<br>
speciropolurimeter (path length 1 cm) and are given in units of 10"1 deg cm2 g"1. Elemental<br>
analysis were .carried out by the "Service de Microanalyses du CNRS, Division de<br>
Vemaison" (France). Analyses indicated by the symbols of the elements or functions were<br>
within ± 0.4% of theoretical values. Thin layer chromatography was performed on precoated<br>
aluminium sheets of Silica Gel 60 FZSA (Merck, Art. 5554), visualisation of products being<br>
accomplished by UV absorbency followed by charring with 10% ethanolic sulfuric acid and<br>
heating. Column chromatography was carried out on Silica Gel 60 (Merck, Art. 9385) at<br>
atmospheric pressure.<br>

A solution of L-ribose 140 (150 g, 1 mol) in methanol (2 liters) was treated with<br>
sulphuric acid (12 ml) and left at +4°C for 12hrs, and then neutralised with pyridine (180 ml).<br>
Evaporation gave an o,p mixture of methyl ribofuranosides 141 as a syrup. A solution of this<br>
anomeric mixture in pyridine (1.3 liters) was treated with benzoyl chloride (580 ml, 5 mol)<br>
with cooling and mechanical stirring. The solution was left at room temperature for 12 hrs<br>
and then poured on ice (about 10 liters) with continued stirring. The mixture (an oil in water)<br>
was filtered on a Cellite bed. The resulting oil on the cellite bed was washed with water (3x3<br>
liters) and then dissolved with ethyl acetate (3 liters). The organic phase was washed with a<br>

evaporated to give l-O-methyl-2,3,5-tri-O-benzoyl-o/p-L-ribofuranose 142 as a thick syrup.<br>
The oil was dissolved in acetic anhydride (560 ml) and acetic acid (240 ml). The solution<br>
was, after the dropwise addition of concentrated sulphuric acid (80 ml), kept in the cold<br>

liters) under continued stirring. The mixture (oily compound in water) was filtered on a<br>
Cellite bed. The resulting gummy solid on the cellite bed was washed with water (3x3 liters)<br>
and then dissolved in dichloromethane (2,5 liters). The organic phase was washed with 5%<br>

Anti-HBV Activity of the Active Compounds<br>
The ability of the active compounds to inhibit the growth of virus in 2.2.15 cell<br>
cultures (HepG2 cells transformed with hepatitis virion) can be evaluated as described in<br>
detail below.<br>
A summary and description of the assay for antiviral effects in this culture system and<br>
the analysis of HBV DNA has been described (Korba and Milman, 1991, Antiviral Res.,<br>
15:217). The antiviral evaluations are performed on two separate passages of cells. All<br>
wells, in all plates, are seeded at the same density and at the same time.<br>
Due to the inherent variations hi the levels of both intracellular and extracellular HBV<br>
DNA, only depressions greater than 3.5-fold (for HBV virion DNA) or 3.0-fold (for HBV<br>
DNA replication intermediates) from the average levels for these HBV DNA forms in<br>
untreated cells are considered to be statistically significant (PO.05). The levels of integrated<br>
HBV DNA in each cellular DNA preparation (which remain constant on a per cell basis hi<br>
these experiments) are used to calculate the levels of intracellular HBV DNA forms, thereby<br>
ensuring that equal amounts of cellular DNA are compared between separate samples.<br>
Typical values for extracellular HBV virion DNA in untreated cells range from 50 to<br>
150 pg/ml culture medium (average of approximately 76 pg/ml). Intracellular HBV DNA<br>
replication intermediates hi untreated cells range from 50 to 100 ug/pg cell DNA (average<br>
approximately 74 pg/ug cell DNA). In general, depressions hi the levels of intracellular HBV<br>
DNA due to treatment with antiviral compounds are less pronounced, and occur more slowly,<br>
than depressions in the levels of HBV virion DNA (Korba and Milman, 1991. Antiviral Res.,<br>
15:217).<br>
The manner in which the hybridization analyses are performed for these experiments<br>
result in an equivalence of approximately 1.0 pg of intracellular HBV DNA to 2-3 genomic<br>
copies per cell and 1.0 pg/ml of extracellular HBV DNA to 3 x 10s viral particles/ml.<br>
Example 7<br>
The ability of the triphosphate derivatives of p-L-dA, p-L-dC, P-L-dU, p-L-2'-dG, PL-<br>

inhibitory activities of triphosphates of p-L-dT (p-L-dT-TP), P-L-dC (p-L-dC-TP), p-L-dU<br>
(p-L-dU-TP) and p-L-dA (p-L-dA-TP) on woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHY) DNA<br>

First, viral load is reduced to undetectable (L-dT) or nearly undetectable (L-dA, L-dC) levels.<br>
Second, L-dA, L-dT and L-dC are shown to be more active than 3TC (lamivudine) in this *<br>
model. Third, viral rebound is not detected for at least two weeks after withdrawal of L-dT.<br>
Fourth, dose response curves suggest that a modes increase in the dose of L-dA and L-dC<br>
would show antiviral activity similar to L-dT. Fifth, all animals receiving the drugs gained<br>
weight and no drug-related toxicity was detected.<br>
Toxicity of Compounds<br>
Toxicity analyses were performed to assess whether any observed antiviral effects are<br>
due to a general effect on cell viability. The method used is the measurement of the effect of<br>

Preparation of Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
Humans suffering from any of the disorders described herein, including hepatitis B,<br>
can be treated by administering to the patient an effective amount of a p-2'-deoxy-|5-Lerythro-<br>
pentofuranonucleoside, for example, p-L-2'-deoxyadenosine, p-L-2'-deoxycytidine,<br>
P-L-2'-deoxyundine, p-L-2'-deoxyguanosine or p-L-2'-deoxythymidine or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug or salt thereof in the presence of a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier or diluent. The active materials can be administered by any appropriate<br>
route, for example, orally, parenterally, intravenously, intradermally, subcutaneously, or<br>
topically, in liquid or solid form.<br>
The active compound is included in the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent<br>
in an amount sufficient to deliver to a patient a therapeutically effective amount of compound<br>
to inhibit viral replication in vivo, without causing serious toxic effects in the patient treated.<br>
By "inhibitory amount" is meant an amount of active ingredient sufficient to exert an<br>
inhibitory effect as measured by, for example, an assay such as the ones described herein.<br>
A preferred dose of the compound for all of the abovementioned conditions will be in<br>
the range from about 1 to 50 mg/kg, preferably 1 to 20 mg/kg, of body weight per day, more<br>
generally 0.1 to about 100 mg per kilogram body weight of the recipient per day. The<br>
effective dosage range of the pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug can be calculated based on<br>
the weight of the parent nucleoside to be delivered. If the prodrug exhibits activity in itself,<br>
the effective dosage can be estimated as above using the weight of the prodrug, or by other<br>
means known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The compound is conveniently administered in unit any suitable dosage form,<br>
including but not limited to one containing 7 to 3000 mg, preferably 70 to 1400 mg of active<br>
ingredient j&gt;er unit dosage form. A oral dosage of 50-1000 mg is usually convenient.<br>
Ideally the active ingredient should be administered to achieve peak plasma<br>
concentrations of the active compound of from about 0.2 to 70 uM, preferably about 1.0 to 10<br>
uM. this may be achieved, for example, by the intravenous injection of a 0.1 to 5% solution<br>
of the active ingredient, optionally in saline, or administered as a bolus of the active<br>
ingredient.<br>
The concentration of active compound in the drug composition will depend on<br>
absorption, inactivation, and excretion rates of the drug as well as other factors known to<br>
those of skill in the art. It is to be noted that dosage values will also vary with the severity of<br>
the condition to be alleviated. It is to be further understood that for any particular subject,<br>
specific dosage regimens should be adjusted over time according to the individual need and<br>
the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the<br>
compositions, and that the concentration ranges set forth herein are exemplary only and are,<br>
not intended to limit the scope or practice of the claimed composition. The active ingredient<br>
may be administered at once, or may be divided into a number of smaller doses to be<br>
administered at varying intervals of time.<br>
A preferred mode of administration of the active compound is oral. Oral<br>
compositions will generally include an inert diluent or an edible carrier. They may be<br>
enclosed in gelatin capsules or compressed into tablets. For the purpose of oral therapeutic<br>
administration, the active compound can be incorporated with excipients and used in the form<br>
of tablets, troches, or capsules. Pharmaceutically compatible binding agents, and/or adjuvant<br>
materials can be included as part of the composition.<br>
The tablets, pills, capsules, troches and the like can contain any of the following<br>
ingredients, or compounds of a similar nature: a binder such as microcrystalline cellulose,<br>
gum tragacanth or gelatin; an excipient such as starch or lactose, a disintegrating agent such<br>
as alginic acid, Primogel, or corn starch; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate or Sterotes; a<br>
glidant such as colloidal silicon dioxide; a sweetening agent such as sucrose or saccharin; or a<br>
flavoring agent such as peppermint, methyl salicylate, or orange flavoring. When the dosage<br>
unit form is a capsule, it can contain, in addition to material of the above type, a liquid carrier<br>
such as a fatty oil. hi addition, dosage unit forms can contain various other materials which<br>
modify the physical form of the dosage unit, for example, coatings of sugar, shellac, or other<br>
enteric agents.<br>
The compound can be administered as a component of an elixir, suspension, syrup,<br>
wafer, chewing gum or the like. A syrup may contain, in addition to the active compounds,<br>
sucrose as a sweetening agent and certain preservatives, dyes and colorings and flavors.<br>
The compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative or salts thereof can also be<br>
mixed with other active materials that do not impair the desired action, or with materials that<br>
supplement the desired action, such as antibiotics, antifungals, antiinflammatories, protease<br>
inhibitors, or other nucleoside or nonnucleoside antiviral agents. Solutions or suspensions<br>
used for parenteral, intradermal, subcutaneous, or topical application can include the<br>
following components: a sterile diluent such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils,<br>
polyethylene glycols, glycerine, propylene glycol or other synthetic solvents; antibacterial<br>
agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or<br>
sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; buffers such as<br>
acetates, citrates or phosphates and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium »<br>
chloride or dextrose. The parental preparation can be enclosed in ampoules, disposable<br>
syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic.<br>
If administered intravenously, preferred carriers are physiological saline or phosphate<br>
buffered saline (PBS).<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the active compounds are prepared with carriers that will<br>
protect the compound against rapid elimination from the body, such as a controlled release<br>
formulation, including implants and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable,<br>
biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethyl ene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides,<br>
polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylacetic acid. Methods for preparation of<br>
such formulations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The materials can also be<br>
obtained commercially from Alza Corporation.<br>
Liposomal suspensions (including liposomes targeted to infected cells with<br>
monoclonal antibodies to viral antigens) are also preferred as pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carriers. These may be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art, for<br>
example, as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,522,811. For example, liposome formulations<br>
may be prepared by dissolving appropriate lipid(s) (such as stearoyl phosphatidyl<br>
ethanolamine, stearoyl phosphatidyl choline, arachadoyl phosphatidyl choline, and<br>
cholesterol) in an inorganic solvent that is then evaporated, leaving behind a thin film of dried<br>
lipid on the surface of the container. An aqueous solution of the active compound or its<br>
monophosphate, diphosphate, and/or triphosphate derivatives is then introduced into the<br>
container. The container is then swirled by hand to free lipid material from the sides of the<br>
container and to disperse lipid aggregates, thereby forming the liposomal suspension.<br>
This invention has been described with reference to its preferred embodiments.<br>
Variations and modifications of the invention, will be obvious to those skilled in the art from<br>
the foregoing detailed description of the invention. It is intended that all of these variations<br>
and modifications be included within the scope of the this invention.<br><br><br><br><br>
