				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention in general relates to the field of printing and emulation switching. Further, this invention relates to reduction of time for printing and similar processes in rendering devices. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method to save emulation switching time in rendering devices.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
Each printer manufacturer supports number of emulation (PCL5, PS, PCL-XL, Epson, GDI, KS etc) for rendering. Depending on the property of incoming job, rendering device switches to appropriate emulation mode for rendering. Once the rendering device gets the job for rendering, it parses the header of the job and then switches to appropriate emulation. This process of determining the emulation will take some time to process the job. By this process total turn around time for first page to print is more.<br>
After receiving the print job request from host rendering device, switch to different emulation depending on the job header. Most of the rendering device switch to different emulation based on print job language (PJL) (@PJL ENTER LANGUAGE=PCL (one kind of emulation)). This PJL command is send by the printer driver to the rendering device along with the print job.<br>
It requires job header processing for determining incoming emulation. If suppose<br>
for switching one emulation to another emulation is "t", then if user sends a print<br>
jobs with alternate emulations for e.g.<br>
1st job is PCL.<br>
2nd job is PS.<br>
3rd job is PCL-XL<br>
4th job is KS.<br>
5th job is SPL.<br>
6th job is PCL.<br>
So for above scenario total time spent for emulation switching is "5*t".<br>
Emulation switches after the print job arrives at rendering device. Due to which first page rendering/printing time is more. Since emulation information is at print job header, print kernel need to parse that header every time to determine the correct emulation for rendering.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A method to save emulation switching time in rendering devices is proposed in this invention wherein before sending the print job to rendering device, printer driver (PCL, PCL-XL, PS, GDI etc) sends the information about the incoming emulation to rendering device. So, that rendering device switches to appropriate emulation before the print job arrives. This method saves the time of print job header processing and emulation switching time.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention explains a method to save emulation switching time in rendering devices comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	selecting the print driver by the user;<br>
(b)	deciding whether incoming information is for emulation or for print job by the print kernel;<br>
(c)	setting the emulation by the print kernel;<br>
(d)	loading the requested emulation by the print kernel if the information is an emulation;<br>
(e)	sending the information about the incoming emulation to rendering device; and<br>
(f)	switching to appropriate emulation before the print job arrives.<br>
The other objects, features and advantages of this invention will be more apparent from the ensuing description of the invention in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 shows the related art control block for emulation switching in rendering device.<br>
Figure 2 shows the related art flow control of switching emulation.<br>
Figure 3 shows the control block of present invention, where user selects the print driver.<br>
Figure 4 shows the present invention flow control for emulation switching. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
Figure 1 shows the related art control block for emulation switching in rendering device. In that user send the print job from HOST PC through printer driver. When <br>
print kernel receives the job it parses the print job header and decide the emulation (PCL, PS, or GDI etc) for printing the job.<br>
Figure 2 shows the related art flow control of switching emulation. Rendering device kernel first read print job header and then switch to appropriate emulation. Print job header consists of PJL commands which contain the attribute of incoming emulation. Before switching to requested emulation print kernel first erases existing emulation and then load requested emulation. And then process the print job.<br>
Figure 3 shows the control block of new art, where user selects the print driver. Printer driver component sends the emulation information to print kernel. After receiving the emulation information print kernel set the emulation. So that when actual print data arrive print kernel need not to switch the emulation. Since in this Driver directly send the emulation info so print kernel will not parse the data, which save the time for parsing the in coming data.<br>
Figure 4 shows the new art flow control for emulation switching. Where print kernel decide whether incoming information is for emulation or for print job. Depending on the incoming information print kernel execute appropriate functions. If it is emulation information then print kernel load requested emulation. If it is print job then, print kernel print the data.<br>
As described above, printer driver will send emulation information about incoming job to rendering device. This information can be send to rendering device at different points in time. Following are the different points at which emulation information can be send to the rendering device:<br>
1.	When user selects the printer driver (PCL, PCL-XL, PS, GDI etc) for printing.<br>
2.	When user is inside the printer driver user interface (Ul).<br>
3.	When user select OK for printing.<br>
Information about the incoming emulation can be sent in the form of PJL (Print Job Language) command or SNMP (Simple network management protocol) request or IPP (Internet Printing Protocol) request at above point of time. Emulation information is send to the device when device is free and waiting for a print job to come. So by doing this we can save time for emulation checking when actual print job comes to the device. By doing this we can decrease the total turns around print time for first page.<br>
The main object of this method is to save the emulation switching time when job arrives at the rendering device. This method saves the time for print job header parsing also, which is mainly done for determining incoming emulation information.<br>
1.	It saves emulation switching time during job processing for printing.<br>
2.	Saves the time for determining the incoming emulation type.<br>
3.	Decrease the print time for first page, by saving time in emulation switching.<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a computer, printer or a multi function device.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood <br>
s included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended laims unless they depart therefrom.<br>
