COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (See Section 10, rule 13)<br>
A PROCESS OF MAKING- SULFUR-CONTAINING POLYUREAURETHANE COMPRISING THE REACTION<br>
PPG INDUSTRIES OHIO,  INC.  of  3800 WEST 143RD STREET, CLEVELAND, OH 44111, U.S.A., AMERICAN Company<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br>
GRANTED       14 JUL 2005<br><br>
This application is a conversion of United States Provisional Patent Application having Serial No. 60/332,829, 5  filed on November 16, 2001."<br>
The present invention relates to a sulfur-containing polyureaurethane and a method of preparing said polyureaurethane.<br>
A number of organic polymeric materials, such as 10  plastics, have been developed as alternatives and replacements for glass in applications such as optical lenses, fiber optics, windows and automotive, nautical and aviation transparencies.  These polymeric materials can provide advantages relative to glass, including, shatter resistance, 15  lighter weight for a given application, ease of molding and ease of dying.  However, the refractive indices of many polymeric materials are generally lower than that of glass. . In ophthalmic applications, the use of a polymeric material having a lower refractive index will require a thicker lens 20  relative to a material having a higher refractive index.  A thicker lens is not desirable.<br>
Thus, there is a need in the art to develop a polymeric material having an adequate refractive index and good impact resistance/strength. 25       The present invention is directed to a sulfur-containing polyureaurethane when at least partially cured having a refractive index of at least 1.57,an Abbe number of at least 35 and a density of less than 1.3 grams/cm3.<br>
Further, the present invention is directed to a sulfur-30  containing polyureaurethane comprising the reaction product of:<br>
(a) a polyureaurethane prepolymer comprising a polycyanate chosen from polyisocyanates, polyisothiocyanates and combinations thereof, and at least one hydrogen-containing 35  material chosen from polyols, polythiols, and materials having both hydroxyl and thiol functional groups;<br><br><br>
(b)	at least one episulfide-containing material; and<br>
(c)	an amine-containing curing agent<br>
wherein when at least partially cured having a refractive index of at least 1.57, an Abbe number of at least 35 and a 5  density of less than 1.3 grams/cm3.<br>
Further, the present invention is directed to a method of preparing a sulfur-containing polyureaurethane .comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	reacting a polyureaurethane prepolymer comprising a<br>
10  polycyanate chosen from polyisocyanates, polyisothiocyanates<br>
and combinations thereof, and at least one hydrogen-containing material chosen from polyols, polythiols, and materials having both hydroxyl and thiol functional groups;<br>
(b)	reacting said prepolymer with at least one<br>
15  episulfide-containing material; and<br>
(c)	reacting mixture from step (b) with an amine-<br>
containing curing agent<br>
wherein when at least partially cured having a refractive index of at least 1.57, an Abbe number of at least 35 and a<br>
20  density of less than 1.3 grams/cm3.<br>
For the purposes of this specification, unless otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing quantities of ingredients, reaction conditions, and so forth used in the specification and claims are to be understood as being modified in all<br>
25  instances by the term "about."  Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth in the following specification and attached claims are approximations that may vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by the present invention.  At the very least, and<br>
30  not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims, each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of reported significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding techniques.<br>
35       Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad scope of the invention are<br><br><br>
approximations, the numerical values set forth in the specific examples are reported as precisely as possible.  Any numerical value, however, inherently contain certain errors necessarily resulting from the standard deviation found in their 5  respective testing measurements.<br>
As used herein and in the claims, the term "cyanate" refers to isocyanate materials and isothiocyanate materials that are unblocked and capable of forming a covalent bond with a reactive group such as a thiol, hydroxyl, or amine function<br>
10  group.  In a non-limiting embodiment, the polycyanate of the present invention can contain at least two functional groups chosen from isocyanate (NCO), isothiocyanate (NCS), and combinations of isocyanate and isothiocyanate functional groups.<br>
15       In alternative non-limiting embodiments, the<br>
polyureaurethane of the invention when polymerized can produce a polymerizate having a refractive index of at least 1.57, or<br>
    at least 1.58, or at least 1.60, or at least 1.62.  In further alternative non-limiting embodiments, the polyureaurethane of<br>
20  the invention when polymerized can produce a polymerizate having an Abbe number of at least 35, or at least 38, or at least 39, or at least 40, or at least 41.  The refractive index and Abbe number can be determined by methods known in the art such as American Standard Test Method (ASTM) Number D<br>
25  542-00.  Further, the refractive index and Abbe number can be determined using various known instruments.  In a non-limiting embodiment of the present invention, the refractive index and Abbe number can be measured in accordance with ASTM D 542-00 with the following exceptions:  (i) test one to two<br>

When used to prepare, photochromic articles, such as<br><br>
lenses, the polymerizate should be transparent to that portion of the electromagnetic spectrum which activates the     <br>
10  photochromic substance (s) incorporated in the matrix i". e. that wavelength of ultraviolet (UV) light that produces the, colored or open form of the photochromic substance and that portion of the visible spectrum that includes the absorption maximum wavelength of the photochromic substance in its UV<br>
15  activated form, i.e., the open form.  Photochromic substances; that may be utilized with the polymerizates of the present invention are organic photochromic compounds or substances   containing same that may be incorporated, e.g., dissolved,   dispersed or diffused into such polymerizates.<br>
20       A first group of organic photochromic substances       <br>

See for example, U.S. Patents: 3,562,172; 3,578,602;<br>
4,215,010; 4,342,668; 5,405,958; 4,637,698; 4,931,219;       <br>
4,816,584; 4,880,667; 4,818,096.	<br>
35       A  second group of organic photochromic substances<br>
contemplated for use to form the photochromic articles of the.<br><br>
present invention are those having at least one absorption maximum and preferably two absorption maxima, within the, visible range of between 400 and less than 500 nanometers These materials typically exhibit a yellow-orange color when 5  exposed to ultraviolet light in an appropriate solvent or<br>
matrix.  Such compounds include certain chromenes, i.e., benzopyrans and naphthopyrans.  Many of such"chromenes are described in the open literature, e.g., U.S. Patents 3,567,605; 4,826,977; 5,066,818; 4,826,977; 5,066,818;  <br>
10  5,466,398; 5,384,077; 5,238,931; and 5,274,132.<br>
A third group of organic photochromic substances contemplated for use to form the photochromic articles of the; present invention are those having an absorption maximum within the visible range of between 400 to 500 nanometers and<br>
15  another absorption maximum within the visible range of betweei 500 to 700 nanometers.  These materials typically exhibit color(s) ranging from yellow/brown to purple/gray when expose    to ultraviolet light in an appropriate solvent or matrix. Examples of these substances include certain benzopyran<br>
20  compounds, having substituents at the 2-position of the pyran ring and a substituted or unsubstituted heterocyclic ring, such as a benzothieno or benzofurano ring fused to the benzen portion of the benzopyran.  Such materials are the subject of U.S. Patent No. 5,429,774.<br>
25       Other photochromic substances contemplated are      photochromic organo-metal dithizonates, i.e., (arylazo)-  thioformic arylhydrazidates, e.g., mercury dithizonates which are described in, for example, U.S. Patent 3,361,706.      Fulgides and fulgimides, e.g. the 3-furyl and 3-thienyl     <br>
30  fulgides and fulgimides which are described in U.S. Patent <br>
4,931,220 at column 20, line 5 through column 21, line 38. <br>
The disclosures relating to such photochromic substances<br>
in the aforedescribed patents are incorporated herein, in   <br>
toto,   by reference.  The photochromic articles of the present<br>
35  invention may contain one photochromic substance or a mixture of photochromic substances, as desired.  Mixtures of        <br><br>
photochromic substances may be used to attain certain<br>
activated colors such as a near neutral gray or brown.     <br>
Each of the photochromic substances described hereinimay,<br>
be used in amounts and in a ratio (when mixtures are used) <br>
such that a polymerizate to which the mixture of compounds is<br>
applied or in which they are incorporated exhibits a desired<br>
resultant color, e.g., a substantially neutral color such"as<br>
shades of gray or brown when activated with unfiltered   <br>
sunlight, i.e., as near a neutral color as possible given the<br>
colors of the activated photochromic substances.  The relative<br>
amounts of the aforesaid photochromic substances used will <br>
vary and depend in part upon the relative intensities of the <br>
color of the activated species of such compounds, and the<br>
ultimate color desired.	<br>
The photochromic compounds or substances described herein<br>
may be applied to or incorporated into the polymerizate by<br>
■|.various methods described in the art. Such methods include <br>
■„..,,. iidissolving or dispersing the substance within the polymerizate, e.g., imbibition of the photochromic substance into the polymerizate by immersion of the polymerizate in an hot solution of the photochromic substance or by thermal transfer; providing the photochromic substance as a separate layer between adjacent layers of the polymerizate, e. g. as a part of a polymer film; and applying the photochromic , substance as a coating or as part of a coating placed on the surface of the polymerizate.  The term "imbibition" or<br>
"imbibe" is intended to mean and include permeation of the<br>
i<br>
photochromic substance alone into the polymerizate, solvent assisted transfer absorption of the photochromic substance into a porous polymer, vapor phase transfer, and other such  transfer mechanisms.  One example of an imbibing method includes the steps of coating the photochromic article with the photochromic substance; heating the surface of the photochromic article; followed by removing the residual coating from the surface of the photochromic article.<br><br>
The amount of photochromic substance or composition containing the same applied to or incorporated into the polymerizate is not critical provided that a sufficient"amount<br>
is used to produce a photochromic effect discernible to the  <br>
5  naked eve upon activation.  Generally such amount can be   <br><br>
described as a photochromic amount.  The particular amount <br>
used depends often upon the intensity of color desired upon,<br>
irradiation thereof and upon the method used to .incorporate or<br>
apply the photochromic substances.  Typically, the more   <br>
10  photochromic substance applied or incorporated, the greater Is<br>
the color intensity.  Generally, the amount of total     <br>
photochromic substance incorporated into or applied to a <br>
photochromic optical polymerizate may range from  0.15 to<br>
0.35 milligrams per square centimeter of surface to which the:<br>
15  photochromic substance(s) is incorporated or applied.<br>
It is also contemplated that photochromic substances may be added to the multi-component organic composition prior to polymerizing, e.g., cast curing, the composition. However, when this is done it is preferred that, the photochromic <br>
20 substance (s) be resistant to potentially adverse interactions, with, for example, initiator(s) that may be present and / or the isocyanate, isothiocyante and amine groups of the first, and second components- These adverse interactions can result in deactivation of the photochromic substance (s) , e.g., by,<br>
25  trapping them in either an open or closed form.  Photochromic substances can also ijiclude photochromic pigments and organic photochromic substances encapsulated in metal oxides, the latter of which are described in U.S. Patents 4, 166, 043 . and 4,367,170.  Organic pliotochromic substances sufficiently    <br>
30  encapsulated within a matrix of an organic polymerizate, as if described in U.S. Patent 4,931,220, may also be incorporated into the multi-component composition of the present invention prior to curing.  If photochromic substances are added to the multi-component organic composition of the present invention<br>
35  prior to curing, they are typically incorporated into the<br><br>
second component prior to mixing the first and second components together.<br>

(TMP) obtained from Aldrich were charged. Desmodur W was    obtained from Bayer Corporation and represents 4,4"-       methyle"nebis (cyclohexyl isocyanate) containing 20% of the trans, trans isomer and 80% of the cis,cis and cis, trans    <br>
20  isomers. The contents of the reactor were stirred at a rate of<br>
150 rpm and a nitrogen blanket was applied as the reactor <br>
contents were heated to a temperature of 120°C at which time <br>
the reaction mixture began to exotherm.  The heat was removed"<br>
and the temperature rose to a peak of 140°C for 30 minutes<br>
25  then began to cool.  Heat was applied to the reactor when"the<br>
temperature reached 120°C and was maintained at that      <br>
temperature for 4 hours.  The reaction: mixture was sampled,and<br>
analyzed for % NCO, according to the method described bellow <br>
in the embodiment.  The analytical result showed about 13.1.%<br>
30 free NCO groups. Before pouring out the contents of the <br>
reactor, 45.3 g of Irganox 1010 (obtained from Ciba Specialty<br>
Chemicals), a thermal stabilizer and 362.7 g of Cyacorb 5411 <br>
(obtained from Cytek), a OV stabilizer were mixed into the <br>
prepolymer.	<br>
35 The NCO concentration of the prepolymer was determined using the following titrimetric procedure in accordance with "<br><br><br>
ASTM-D-2572-91.  The titrimetric method consisted of adding a<br>
2 gram sample of Component A to an Erlenmeyer flask.  This<br>
sample was purged with nitrogen and several glass beads (5mhi)<br>
were then added,  To this mixture was added 20 mL of IN   <br>
5  dibutylamine (in toluene) with a pipet.  The mixture was <br>
swirled and capped.  The flask was then placed on a heating <br>
source and the flask was heated to slight reflux, held for 15<br>
minutes at this temperature and then cooled to room	<br>
temperature.  Note, a piece of Teflon was placed between the <br>
10  stopper and joint to prevent pressure buildup while heating. During the heating cycle, the contents were frequently swirled in an attempt for complete solution and reaction.  Blank values were obtained and determined by the direct titration of 20 mL of pipeted IN dibutylamine (DBA) plus 50 mL of methanol,<br>
15  with IN hydrochloric acid (HCl) using the Titrino 751 dynamic;<br>
autotitrator.  Once the average values for the HCl normalities <br>
and DBA blanks were calculated, the values were programmed <br>
!  into the autotitrator.  After the sample, had cooled, the <br>
contents were transferred into a beaker with approximately 50-<br>
20  60 mL of methanol.  A magnetic stirring bar was added and the sample titrated with IN HCl using the preprogrammed Titrino 751 autotitrator.  The percent NCO and IEW (isocyanate equivalent weight) were calculated automatically in accordance with the following formulas:<br>
25       %NCO=(mLs blank-mLs sample)(Normality HCl)(4.2018)/sample<br>
wt., grams	<br>
IEW=(sample wt., grams)1000/(mLs blank-mLs sample)(Normality HCl). The "Normality HCl" value was determined as follows.  To a<br>
30  pre-weighed beaker was added 0. 4 grams of Na2C03 primary     standard and the weight was recorded.  To this was added 50 mL of deionized water and the Na2C03 was dissolved with magnetic stirring.  An autotitrator (i.e., Metrohm GPD Titrino 751 dynamic autotitrator with 50 mL buret) equipped with a   <br>
35  combination pH electrode (i.e., Metrohm combination glass  electrode No. 6,0222.100), was used to titrate the primary <br><br><br>
standard with the IN HC1 and the volume was recorded.  This <br>
procedure was repeated two additional times for a total of <br>
three titrations and the average was used as the normality1  <br>
according to the following formula: 	<br>
