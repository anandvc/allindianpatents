				<td>This invention relates to novei aromatic cyanate ester compounds having at least two rings (inked by an unsaturated group containing member, prepolymers and compositions thereof, and processes for making the same. The compounds can be employed in adhesives, composites, laminates and molding compositions.

There is a need in the transportation industry, particularly for aircraft interiors, for molded polymeric components that exhibit very low peak heat release rates. Many cyanate esters exhibit good dielectric properties, water absorption and flame retardancy.

Low peak heat release rates can be attained using other high performance polymers such as polyphenylsulfone, polyamineimides, polybenzoimadazoles and polybenzoxazoles. AN of trie currently available polymers having relatively low peak heat release rates suffer from one or more disadvantages such as high cost of manufacture or challenging processing requirements. The present invention produces molded articles having the desired low peak heat release rate using cyanate ester compounds and compositions thereof.<br><br><br>

Suitable solvents include ketones, such as methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, aromatic hydrocarbons, such as toluene or xylene, ethers, such as dioxane, tetrahydrofuran or ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, amides, such as dimethylformamide or dimethylacetamide and mixtures thereof. Aromatic hydrocarbons and ketones are preferred.<br>
For casting applications, a thermosetting composition described above is heated to a molten state to produce a prepoiymer composition before casting into a mold, and then allowed to cure at an elevated temperature. For bonding applications, a resin varnish or molten prepoiymer composition is applied to the surfaces to be bonded, and then allowed to cure under heat and pressure. Prepregs are produced by impregnating a suitable substrate with a resin varnish containing the inventive compound and drying the impregnated substrate. The impregnation apparatus can be of conventional design. Examples of substrates used in the preparation of prepregs include carbon fiber, glass fiber substrates, such as glass cloth or glass non-woven fabric, cellulosic substrates, such as kraft paper or cotton linter paper, synthetic fiber fabric such as aramide cloth or aramide nonwoven fabric. Composite laminates can be produced using different types of substrates in combination. The compounds and compositions disclosed herein can be utilized to produce aircraft interior section in known fashion, such as the interiors disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,714,419, assigned on its face to Fiberite, Inc., which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Microcombustion data for molded articles containing the inventive compounds were obtained using a pyrolysis-combustion flow calorimeter developed by the Federal Aviation Administration ("FAA"). In the test, 1 to 5 mg sample is placed in a 10-mm-long by 2.5-mm outside diameter quartz tube. A linear 10°C/second heating rate is used. The pyrolysis products are swept from the pyrolyzer by flowing nitrogen gas stream through a heated Uansier line and mixed with excess oxygen prior to entering a high-temperature lurnace to force complete combustion of the pyrolyzate. The heat release by combustion is calculated from the oxygen consumption using a universal value of 13.1 kJ of heat released per gram<br><br>
of diatomic oxygen consumed.   The data of peak heat release rate and total heat release are obtained from the calorimeter on triplicate samples of each material measured.<br>
The flammability resistance for the resin was also measured according to the Ohio State University heat release test (OSU test). This test measures the amount of heat evolved in a period of 2 minutes (C) as well as the rare of heat evolution at the peak (BJ when a given test sample is exposed to radiation under specified conditions. OSU test results in a curve of heat evolution versus time. The rate of heat is increased at specified conditions according to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). This corresponds to the impingement of a sample at rate of 3.5 watts/cm2. The volatiles are completely burnt by a small flame and the heat evolved is recorded as a function of time. Glass fabric does not contribute to heat evolution.<br><br><br>

The reaction temperature is maintained below-20°C. After the addition, the resulting mixture is allowed to warm up to 0"C and quenched with dilute HCI aqueous solution. The organic layer is washed further with water several times and concentrated under vacuum to afford the desired product.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
laminates are weighed and the resin content is determined to be about 35 %. Ex. 2a is the sandwich panel with glass fabric and ex. 2b is the sandwich panel with carbon fabric. Comp. 2a is made from phenol formaldehyde resin and glass fabric. Comp. 2b is made from phenol formaldehyde resin and carbon fabric. The OSU test is carried out on each sample in triplicate- The average of three value is shown in Table 2.<br><br><br><br>
