The present invention relates to a busbar device for an electrical power supply and/or distribution installation.<br>
It is already known from the document DE-A-3,143,518 to use a set of insertable shims to receive conductors of different dimensions in the same insulating support The use of these shims enables widthways and heightways adjustment according to the specific cross-section of the bars.<br>
The document DE-GM 7,709,147 shows flat conducting bars inserted in housings of a support with shims fitted in the bottom of the recesses. The depth of the recesses corresponds to a multiple of the thickness of each bar.<br><br>
The lesson to be drawn from this prior art shows that all the current conductors are located in a single plan at the level of the assembly interface of the two fixing parts of the insulating support. It is then indispensable to deform the electrical switchgear connecting conductors, to avoid any contact with a bar of a different phase, which complicates installation of the electrical cabinet.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the invention is to improve the electrical connection of the switchgear with the power supply or distribution busbar of a cabinet.<br>
The busbar device according to the invention is characterized in that the bottoms of the recesses are located in distinct planes extending in a parallel manner along the longitudinal direction of the profiled sections, and separated from one anotiher by a preset transverse pitch, and that the profiled sections of the current conductors are staggered at regular intervals in the extension direction of the assembly interface of the fixing parts to form a stepped structure.<br>
The presence of the transverse stagger of the current conductors allows access from the front to connect the connecting conductors to the contact faces of the busbar conductors. The connecting conductors can be straight and do not require any deformation, due to the fact that the different contact faces are located in different planes.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a busbar device for an electrical power supply and/or distribution installatifMi, comprising : current conductors formed by dongated profiled sections made from a good electrical conducting material, notably copper or aluminium based; at least one insulating support block composed of a first fixing part engageable with a second fixing part to constitute a plurality of individual housings to receive each current conductor, said insulating support extending perpendicularly with respect to the longitudinal direction of the profiled sections; semi-open recesses made in the first and/or second fixing part on the assembly interface side to bound said bouiings and assembly means to perform tightening of the two fixing parts against one another at the level of said interface; characterized in that the bottoms of the recesses are located in distinct planes extending in a parallel manner along the longitudinal direction of the profiled sections, and separated from one another by a preset transverse pitch, and that the profiled sections of the current conductors are staggered at regular intervals in the extension direction of the assembly interface of the fixing parts to form a stepped structure.<br>
Other advantagies and features of the invention will become more clearly apparent from the following description of an embodiment of the invention, given as a non-restrictive example only and represented in the accompanying drawings in which;<br><br>
In figure 1, the profiled section of the current conductor lOA has a C-shaped cross-section comprising a longitudinal groove 11 associated to a parallel first and second wing 14, 16, which are joined to a common branch 18. The central groove 11 is arranged between two respective protrusions 20, 22 of the wings 14, 16, each protrusion 20, 22 being shaped as a hook having a straight edge 24 extending parallel to the wings 14, 16. The width of the groove 11 measured between the edges 24 of the protrusions 20, 22 is smaller than the distance separating the two parallel wings 14, 16. The internal space of the profiled section forms a semi-open recess 13, which is accessed at the level of the groove 11. The common branch 18 bears a central flange 26, arranged on the side external to the groove 11.<br>
According to the alternative embodiment of figure 2, the current conductor lOB has a similar structure to that of the conductor lOA of figure 1, but the branch 18 is provided with two flanges 28, 30 arranged respectively in the extension of the wings 14, 16.<br>
In figure 3, the profiled section of the conductor IOC comprises two identical notches 13, arranged s^'mmetrically back to back at the level of the common branch 18. A flange 32 eKtends in the extension of the branch 18 and perpendicularly to the wing 16. The conductor can also be achieved without the flange 32.<br>
The structure of the conductor lOD of figure 4 is similar to that of figure 2, with an additional flange 32 in the extension of the common branch 18.<br>
The conductor lOE of figure 5 is similar to that of figure 3, with three parallel flanges 34, 36, 38 facing downwards. The central flange 36 is located in the extension of the branch 18 and is shorter than the other two adjacent flanges 34, 38. The<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
According to figures 1 to 8, the current conductors are formed by profiled sections of different cross-sections, and made from a good electricity conducting material notably copper or aluminium. These conductors can be used in a multipole busbar of a low voltage electrical distribution installation, which will be described hereafter with reference to figures 12 and 14.<br><br>
profilled section lOF of figure 6 corresponds to that of figure 4 but with three lower flanges 34, 36, 38 of the same lengths.<br>
The current conductor lOG of figure 7 is equipped with two horizontal flanges 28, 40 and two vertical flanges 34, 38. All of the current conductors 1OC to lOG illustrated in figures 3 to 7 present profiled sections of the same dimensions 30 x 45 mm.<br>
In figure 8, the profiled section of the conductor lOH is provided with three C-shaped notches 13, the two upper ones of which are adjoined to one another by the branch 18. The junction with the third lower notch 13 is achieved by means of inclined flanges 42, 44. The dimensions of the conductor lOH correspond to 30 x 60 mm.<br>
The distance d corresponding to a width of 30 mm is identical for all the profiled sections of the conductors 10A to lOH. The height of 30 mm is also the same for the first series of two conductors lOA and lOB. It is 45 mm for all the conductors 1OC to lOG of the second series, and reaches 60 mm for the last conductor lOH. The heightwise pitch variation is 15 mm from one series to the other.<br>
The flanges of the different current conductors lOA to lOH form an integral part of the profiled sections and have the current flowing through them. This results in a double function of electrical conduction and thermal dissipation by means of a profiled section manufactured in a single part.<br>
With reference to figures 9 and 10, each type of current conductors lOA to lOH, represented in figures 1 to 8, can be inserted in at least one insulating support block 66, 68 to constitute a multipole busbar device 64. The choice of the type of conductor is made according to the current rating of the electrical cabinet. The conductors 10A to lOB of figures 1<br><br>
and 2 will be used for low ratings, those 1OC to lOG of figures 3 to 7 for medium ratings, and the conductor lOH of figure 8 for high ratings.<br>
In figure 9, the insulating support block 66 comprises two fixing parts 66A, 66B designed to be assembled against one another to form housings 50 receiving the current conductors lOF and lOB. The first fixing part 66A comprises a succession of square-shaped semi-open recesses 52, each side of which is slightly larger than the distance d. The current conductor lOA or lOB of figures 1 and 2 can be totally inserted inside each recess 52.<br>
The respective bottoms 54 of the different recesses 52 are located in distinct planes extending parallel to the longitudinal direction of the profiled sections, and separated from one another by regular intervals.<br>
The first fixing part 66A is in addition equipped with a plurality of bearing faces 5 6 situated opposite the respective recesses 52 in parallel planes separated from one another by regular intervals, whose dimensions correspond to those of the bottoms 54. The different bearing faces 56 of the part 66A form a stepped structure designed to be securedly affixed to conjugate faces of a metallic auxiliary support 58. The latter is equipped with a straight spacer 60 fixed to two coplanar uprights 70, 72 of the frame. The other two opposite uprights 74, 76 serve the purpose of fixing the support spacer 77 of the mounting plate 7 9 (figure 12).<br>
The second fixing part 66B is provided with a succession of positioning studs 90 constituting a rake structure, designed to cooperate with the current conductors lOF and lOB to enable assembly of the insulating support 66 independently from the type of current conductors. The lower studs 90 come directly into contact against the external surface of the fins or<br><br>
ranges ot the conductor lOB at the level of the lower housing 50. In the three upper housings 50, the positioning studs 90 engage inside grooves 92 arranged between the flanges 34, 36, 38. In the embodiment of figures 9 and 10, the studs9C are moulded with the second fi.xing part 66B.<br>
Each fixing part 66A, 66B (figure 9) is in addition equipped with a first pair of joining faces 94, 96 to the upper part, with a second pair of joining faces 98, 100 to the lower part, and with three pairs of intermediate joining faces 102, 104; 106, 108; 110, 112. The joining faces of each pair come into contact with one another when assembly of the two fixing parts 66A, 66B is performed by means of screws 114 passing through aligned orifices made in the insulating body of the two adjoined parts 66A, 66B.<br>
At least one bearing face 56 of the first fixing part 66A is provided with a latching spur 116 cooperating with the metallic support 58 to perform centering of the screws 114 with respect to nuts 118 securedly affixed to the support 58.<br>
In the assembled position of the support block 66, the respective joining faces 94, 96; 98, 100 of the first and second pairs are in planes parallel to the longitudinal direction, whereas the other faces 102, 104; 106, 108; 110, 112 are located two by two in three parallel planes inclined with respect to the same longitudinal direction.<br>
In figure 10, it is apparent that the transverse stagger of the grooves 11 arranged facing the contact faces 120 of the different conductors lOF and lOB has a regular pitch, for example 22 millimeters. Such a transverse stagger of the current conductors lOF and lOB allows access from the front to each groove 11 for connection of the prefabricated connecting conductors 80 of the electrical switchgear 78 fixed onto the mounting plate 79 (see figure 12).<br><br>
With reference to figure 9, the side walls on each side of the bottom 54 of each recess 52 of the first fixing part 66A comprise at least one protuberance 122 in the middle zone to form a hangup point holding the current conductor inside the housing 50.<br>
In the embodiment of figure 11, the structure of the second fixing part 166B is identical to that of the first part 66A, with an arrangement reversed 18 0 degrees when the assembly phase takes place. The positioning studs are arranged on removable wedging shims 124 able to be fitted in the recesses 152 of the second fixing part 166B. Fitting of the wedging shims 124 in the recesses 152 is compulsory when the current conductors lOA to lOG are used. The wedging shims 124 simply have to be removed when the conductor lOH of figure 8 is used.<br>
Figure 13 shows the connection device at the level of a current conductor lOF. The connection device comprises a fixing screw 82 whose head is housed captive inside the recess 13 of the profiled section. The threaded body of the screw 82 extends through the groove 11 towards the outside of the profiled section, passing through a hole 84 arranged at the end of the connecting conductor 80. A nut 86, accessible from outside, cooperates with the screw 82 to perform tightening of the conductor 80 against the contact face 120 of the profiled section.<br>
With reference to figure 14, the left-hand part corresponds to the architecture of figure 12, associated to the multipole busbar 64 with vertical disposition. It is possible to add other rows of mounting plates on the right-hand- side, one of which mounting plates is represented by the reference 179, fixed to the uprights 70, 72 by a reversible second spacer 177. This results in two electrical switchgear units 78, 178 being able to be mounted face to face while guaranteeing access to the connections from the front by means of a single<br><br>
intercalated busbar 64.<br>
The bushings of the connecting conductors 80, 180 can be sealed off at the level of the spacers 77, 177 so as to partition the lateral compartments of the switchgear with respect to that of the busbar 64.<br>
An example of a tightly sealed bushing is represented on the spacer 187 of figure 15 and 16, enabling a built-in connection unit to be obtained, for example for a 250A rating.<br>
The center part of the spacer 187 comprises an insulating case 188 with single-pole elements through which insulated flexible conductors 80 pass at the level of each phase for connection of the switchgear 78 to the busbar 64.<br>
According to the alternative embodiment represented in figures 17 and IS, applied to an electrical switchboard having a rating of 45GA-630A, the spacer 187 is also equipped with an insulating case 190 with single-pole elements. Electrical connection of the switchgear 73 to the busbar 64 is performed at the level of each phase by two elementary conductors 192, 194 shaped as bare rigid bars, connected respectively to the switchgear device 78 at the point 196, and to the corresponding bar at the point 198. At the level of the case 190, the ends 192a and 194a of the conductors are arranged facing one another, and assembled to one another by means of fixing parts.<br><br><br>
