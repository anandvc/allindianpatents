				<td>PRESSURE SENSOR WITH COMPENSATION FOR NULL SHIFT NON-LINEARITY<br>
AT VERY LOW TEMPERATURES<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a pressure sensor<br>
of the type comprising strain gauges mounted in<br>
respective arms of a Wheatstone bridge.<br>
The field to which the invention relates more<br>
particularly is that of pressure sensors usable at very<br>
low temperatures, typically at temperatures below the<br>
boiling rate of nitrogen, and possibly going down to a<br>
few Kelvins only.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
A well-known problem with strain gauge pressure<br>
sensors connected as a Wheatstone bridge is that of the<br>
zero point of the bridge drifting as a. function of<br>
temperature.<br>
To resolve that problem, use is generally made of<br>
compensation networks connected to the inputs and/or the<br>
outputs of the bridge. Those networks which include at<br>
least one temperature-sensitive element, are generally<br>
designed to provide linear compensation, given that the<br>
temperature drift of strain gauge bridges is<br>
substantially linear over ordinary temperature ranges.<br>
An additional difficulty arises when the pressure<br>
sensors are used at very low temperatures. The<br>
temperature drift of strain gauge bridges then becomes<br>
non-linear, and the non-linearity increases with<br>
decreasing temperature. This can be seen from. Figure 1<br>
which shows how the output voltage from a strain gauge<br>
bridge made up of thin film nickel-chromium deposits on a<br>
silicon substrate varies as a function of temperature,<br>
the bridge being at equilibrium (zero output voltage) at<br>
a temperature of 22°C.<br>
Ordinary compensation networks become ineffective,<br>
particularly since the thermistors used generally also<br>
have resistance that becomes very high and virtually<br>
infinite when the temperature drops below -40°C or -50°C.<br>
The problem which the present invention seeks to<br>
resolve is that of compensating the non-linearity of .<br>
temperature drift, and consequently that of "linearizing"<br>
such drift at very low temperatures, in particular at<br>
temperatures below the boiling point of nitrogen, i.e.<br>
below about -196°C.<br>
Brief summary of the invention<br>
The problem is resolved by a pressure sensor in<br>
which the strain gauge of at least one of the arms of the<br>
bridge is in series with' a resistor of resistance that is<br>
much less than that of the strain gauge and which is<br>
connected in parallel with a compensation circuit<br>
comprising a resistive element whose resistance varies as<br>
a function of temperature so as to influence the<br>
resistance of the resistor with which it is connected in<br>
parallel over the very low temperature range in a manner<br>
that is substantial and that increases with<br>
decreasing temperature.<br>
The resistor having the compensation circuit<br>
connected in parallel therewith is of resistance that is<br>
much less than that of the strain gauge so as to avoid<br>
penalizing the magnitude of the operating range and the<br>
sensitivity of the bridge. In the present specification,<br>
a resistance that is "much less than" another resistance<br>
is less than l/20th or even l/100th or even less of the<br>
resistance of a strain gauge.<br>
According to a feature of the pressure sensor of the<br>
invention, the compensation circuit is connected in<br>
parallel with a resistor formed by a connection lead<br>
connecting the strain gauge to one of the corners of the<br>
bridge.<br>
Thus, there is no need to modify the bridge in order<br>
to connect the compensation circuit thereto. This avoids<br>
any instabilities that could be generated if it were<br>
necessary to open the bridge for this purpose.<br>
In addition, the circuit for compensating non-<br>
linearity can thus be placed very close to the bridge,<br>
thereby exposing it to exactly the same temperature<br>
conditions as the bridge.<br>
The strain gauges and the connection leads<br>
connecting the strain gauges to the corners of the bridge<br>
are preferably constituted by deposits of metal on a<br>
substrate.<br>
To compensate non-linearity in the very low<br>
temperature range, i.e. below -196°C, the resistive<br>
element of the compensation circuit must have a<br>
resistance such as to have an influence on the resistance<br>
of the resistor with which it is connected in parallel,<br>
and to do so increasingly with decreasing temperature.<br>
To this end, it is preferable for the ratio of the<br>
resistance of the resistive element to that of the<br>
resistor on which it is connected in parallel to be no<br>
greater than 100 when the temperature drops below -196°C,<br>
and to decrease thereafter with decreasing temperature.<br>
By way of example, such a resistive element can be<br>
constituted by a platinum probe.<br>

Statement of invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a pressure sensor with compensation for<br>
null shift non-linearity at very low temperatures, said sensor comprising strain gauges (J1<br>
to J4) mounted in respective arms of a Wheatstone bridge (10), and means (20) for<br>
compensating the zero drift of the bridge as a function of temperature, the sensor being<br>
characterized in that, in order to compensate for non-linearity in zero drift at very low<br>
temperatures, the strain gauge (Jl, J2, J3, J4) in at least one of the arms of the bridge (10)<br>
is in series with a resistor (C) of resistance that is much lower than that of the strain<br>
gauge (Jl, J2, J3,. J4) and which is connected in parallel with a compensation circuit<br>
comprising a resistive element (P) whose resistance varies as a function of temperature in<br>
such a manner as to influence the resistance of the parallel circuit of which it forms a<br>
part, in the very low temperature range, in a manner that is substantial and that increases<br>
with decreasing temperature.<br>
Brief description of the accompanying drawings<br>
In the accompanying drawings:<br>
Figure 1 shows how the zero drift of a pressure sensor constituted by a strain gauge<br>
bridge varies as a function of temperature in the absence of drift compensation;<br>
Figure 2 is an electrical circuit diagram of an embodiment of the pressure sensor of the<br>
invention; and<br>
Figure 3 shows how the zero drift of the Figure 1 pressure sensor fitted with a circuit for<br>
compensating non-linear temperature drift in accordance with the invention varies as a<br>
function of temperature.<br>
Detailed description of a preferred embodiment<br>
Figure 2 is a circuit diagram of a pressure sensor<br>
comprising four strain gauges Jl, J2, J3, and J4 inserted<br>
in respective ones of the four arms of a Wheatstone<br>
bridge 10. Each of the strain gauges Jl to J4 is<br>
connected to two adjacent corners of the bridge by<br>
connection leads c.<br>
The strain gauges Jl to J4 and the connection leads<br>
c are all formed by deposits of metal on a substrate,<br>
e.g. a silicon substrate, forming part of the sensitive<br>
element of the sensor. In well-known manner, two of the<br>
strain gauges in two opposite arms of the bridge are<br>
placed on the substrate so as to be extended when the<br>
substrate is subjected to a pressure for measurement,<br>
while the other two strain gauges are disposed in such a<br>
manner as to be subjected to compression.<br>
By way of example, the strain gauges Jl to J4 can be<br>
constituted by nickel-chromium deposits that are as<br>
identical as possible, while the connection leads c can<br>
be constituted, for example, by deposits of gold,<br>
likewise as identical as possible.<br>
The deposits are implemented as thin films, e.g. by<br>
vacuum sputtering, with the bridge being closed by the<br>
resulting deposits.<br>
Two opposite corners +a and -a of the bridge are<br>
connected to power supply terminals +A and -A, while the<br>
other two corners +m and -m are connected to measurement<br>
terminals +M and -M. An interposed compensation network<br>
12 has one side connected to the corners +a, -a, +m, and<br>
-m and has its other side connected to the terminals +A,<br>
-A, +M, and -M. The compensation network 10 seeks to<br>
compensate the linear drift of the pressure sensor as a<br>
function of temperature. It is constituted by a<br>
resistive network of conventional type, e.g. as described<br>
in document FR—A 2 613 83 3<br>
A circuit 20 for compensating non-linear zero drift<br>
of the bridge is connected in parallel with one of the<br>
connection leads c connecting one of the strain gauges of<br>
the bridge, e.g. the strain gauge J2, to one of the two<br>
corners of the bridge situated at the ends of its arm<br>
containing the strain gauge, e.g. the corner +m.<br>
The compensation circuit 2 0 comprises a resistive<br>
element P whose resistance varies as a function of<br>
temperature, and in particular in the very low<br>
temperature range, i.e., typically, the temperatures<br>
lower than the boiling point of nitrogen (-196°C). An<br>
adjustable resistor R can be connected in series with the<br>
resistive element P, within the compensation circuit, so<br>
as to enable the resulting compensation to be adjusted.<br>
Connecting the resistive element in parallel with a<br>
portion of the total resistance of one of the arms of the<br>
bridge thus makes it possible to have a. non-linear<br>
influence on the behavior of the bridge, and thus to<br>
compensate for its non-linear drift. When such non-<br>
linearity increases with decreasing temperature, then the<br>
influence of the resistive element P must increase, i.e.<br>
its resistance must decrease, so that the ratio of said<br>
resistance to the resistance of a connection lead c<br>
becomes no greater than 100 when the temperature drops<br>
below -196°C, and decreases as the temperature continues<br>
to drop below -196°C. Under such circumstances, a<br>
resistive element P is used whose temperature coefficient<br>
is positive, for example a platinum probe can be used.<br>
A pressure sensor as shown in Figure 2 has been made<br>
using strain gauges formed by depositing a thin film of<br>
nickel-chromium, with each strain gauge having a<br>
resistance of 1000 O at ambient temperature (22°C). The<br>
connection leads c. are linear thin-film deposits of gold,<br>
each having a resistance of 0.6 O at 22°C.<br>
Figure 1 shows how the voltage picked up across the<br>
corners +m and -m of the bridge varies in the absence of<br>
any stress being applied to the sensor, and in the<br>
absence of the compensation network 12 and the<br>
compensation circuit 20, the bridge being in equilibrium<br>
(zero output voltage) at 22°C.<br>
It can be seen that the zero drift of the bridge,<br>
due essentially to the strain gauges, becomes more and<br>
more pronounced as temperature decreases. Down to about.<br>
-140°C, drift is substantially linear. At lower<br>
temperatures, the non-linearity of the drift becomes more<br>
and more perceptible.<br>
A compensation circuit constituted by a platinum<br>
probe P of resistance equal to 100 O at 0°C connected in<br>
series with an adjustable resistance R is connected in<br>
parallel with the connection lead made of gold that<br>
connects the strain gauge J2 to the corner +m of the<br>
bridge.<br>
Table 1 below shows the resistances of a connection<br>
lead c. and of the probe P, while the adjustable<br>
resistance R is zero, and it also shows the equivalent<br>
resistance of the parallel circuit formed by P and c., at<br>
various different temperatures. The ratio of the<br>
resistance of the probe P to that of the connection lead<br>
c passes from about 47 to about 7.9 over the range -196°C<br>
to -246°C.<br>
Including the compensation circuit 20 causes the<br>
zero of the bridge to be offset, and the amount of offset<br>
increases with decreasing temperature. Table 2 below<br>
gives the value of the offset AZ measured as bridge<br>
output voltage, while the strain gauges are not subjected<br>
to stress (with 800 O strain gauges, an offset of 6.4 O.<br>
in any one strain gauge produces an output voltage of<br>
2 0 mV when the bridge is powered at 10 V). The various<br>
offsets AZ given in Table 2 correspond to different<br>
values of the compensation circuit and to different<br>
temperatures. The rows of the table show that the offset<br>
can be attenuated by increasing the resistance R or can<br>
be emphasized by decreasing the resistance P (e.g. by<br>
placing two 100 O probes in parallel). The particular<br>
compensation circuit that needs to be selected thus<br>
depends on the amount of non-linearity that needs to be<br>
corrected.<br><br>
Figure 3 shows how the voltage picked up between the<br>
corners +m and -m of the bridge varies under the same<br>
conditions as for Figure 1, i.e. no stress on the sensor,<br>
bridge at equilibrium at 22°C, and no linear<br>
compensation, but with various different compensation<br>
circuits 20 having a resistor R in series with two probes<br>
P in parallel, each probe P being a platinum probe whose<br>
resistance is 100 O at 0°C.<br>
It can be seen that compared with curve I showing<br>
variation in zero drift in the absence of the<br>
compensation circuit 20, non-linearity correction becomes<br>
increasingly emphasized with decreasing resistance for<br>
the resistor R. In this example, when R = 4 O and with<br>
two probes P in parallel, the zero drift of the bridge is<br>
linearized down to very low temperatures (about -250°C).<br>
The action of the linear compensation network 12 thus<br>
makes it possible to compensate for the temperature drift<br>
of the bridge zero completely, all the way from ambient<br>
temperature to very low temperatures (a few Kelvins).<br>
In the above, a circuit for compensating non-linear<br>
drift is described as being connected in parallel with<br>
one of the connection leads connecting a strain gauge in<br>
one of the arms of the bridge to a corner of the bridge.<br>
The same effect can be achieved by connecting a non-<br>
linear drift compensation circuit in parallel with one<br>
and/or both of the connection leads of this arm of the<br>
bridge and/or in parallel with one and/or both of the<br>
connection leads of the opposite arm.<br>
In Figure 1, non-linearity varies in the same<br>
direction as the linear component of the drift and it<br>
makes it worse, however under other circumstances, non-<br>
linearity could vary in the opposite direction.<br>
Depending on the direction of this variation, the<br>
compensation circuit should be connected either to one or<br>
both of a first pair of opposite arms of the bridge, or<br>
else to one and/or both of the other two opposite arms of<br>
the bridge.<br>
