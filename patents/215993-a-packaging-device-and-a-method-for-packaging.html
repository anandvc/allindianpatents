				<td>TITLE:	PACKAGING      DEVICE      FOR      DISC-SHAPED      ITEMS      AND<br>
RELATED   MATERIALS  AND   METHOD   FOR  PACKAGING   SUCH DISCS AND MATERIAL<br>
Fieid of the Invention<br>
This invention relates, in general, to a device for packaging and displaying a circular or disc-shaped media and other materials and a method for packaging such disc-shaped media and other materials and, in particular to containers and methods for initially packaging and thereafter repeatedly storing disc-shaped media together with or without other materials.<br>
Still more particularly, the present invention relates to a new and improved container for initially packaging and thereafter repeated storing of disc-shaped media and other materials in stacked relationship, having a first chamber and a second chamber stacked on top of one another for respectively receiving and securely retaining the disc media and the other materials.<br>
Still more particularly, the present invention further relates to a new and improved method for initially packaging and thereafter repeated storing of media and other materials in stacked relationship, wherein in a preferred embodiment the other materials are placed inside an open ended container, a support element is inserted into the container through the open end, media is inserted into the container through the open end and placed in seating engagement with the support element and a lid is applied to the open end of the container.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Packaging and storage devices for media are generally known. Disc-shaped media, such as CD"s, DVD"s or.CD-ROM"s, encounter special.problems in handling, packaging and storage due to their delicate, flat recorded surfaces.   Such disc media is generally sold in plastic cases<br><br>
which are sometimes referred to as "jewel boxes." Such cases are generally rectansular and have a mounting hub for holding the disc media by its center aperture, Such cases are usually kept after purchase of the disc media and utilized for re-packaging of the disc media between usage. Such jewel boxes are impractical packaging containers for shipping because of their small dimensions and easy breakage, and they thus require substantial additional packaging material or placement in larger shipping containers.<br>
Disc media is routinely sold with other materials (whether directly related to the content of the disc media, i.e., ancillary, or otherwise). At the present time, disc media in such "jewel boxes" is commonly packaged together with ancillary materials in larger rectangular shaped cardboard boxes for shipping, sale and packaging. The "jewel boxes" are necessary to reliably protect the disc media from contact with the ancillary materials in the larger cardboard boxes. Such plastic case/cardboard box combination package arrangements are not only expensive, they also do not lend themselves to easy and secure repeated re-storage of the disc media and ancillary materials. They are often damaged during initial opening and repeated re-storage. They are often unable after initial opening to securely re-store the disc media (in the jewel box) and the other materials together in the cardboard packaging m a manner to preclude contact with each other. They frequently become unsightly after initial opening and repeated re-storage. They are, themselves, difficult to handle and store.<br>
Other types of packaging and storage devices are needed to organize, protect, ship, display at retail and store disc media sold and/or shipped in combination with ancillary materials.<br>
A need also exists for devices which can effectively and efficiently organize, protect, ship, display at retail and store disc shaped media with other materials.<br><br>
An opportunity exists that is not being commercially- exploited at the present time to distribute disc-shaped recording media with materials that are either ancillary or wholly unrelated to the content of the disc media. This opportunity is not being exploited due to the lack of an effective container design and method for efficiently organizing, protecting, shipping, displaying at retail and storing disc-shaped media packaged with other materials.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
One important object of this invention is to provide a container in which and a method whereby disc-shaped media and ancillary materials can initially be packaged together in stacked relationship and, after removal and use, they can easily be re-stored in stacked relationship in a manner so as to avoid contact there between.<br>

Another object of this invention is to provide a container and a method of packaging whereby either an annular lip or protrusions extend from the internal wall of the first chamber of the container and define an opening slightly smaller in internal diameter than the external diameter of the disc media on which the disc media can seat to thus retain the disc media in the container against movement in a first direction perpendicular to the plane of the disc media.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a container and a method of packaging whereby the container has a removal lid that attaches to the container when the disc media is either initially positioned or subsequently re-stored on the seat and that retains the disc media against movement in a second, opposite direction perpendicular to the plane of the disc media.<br>
Another object with this invention is to provide a container and a method packaging whereby the seat and lid are removable and the seat and lid can be combined to create a permanent storage and restoring package for the disc media alone.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a container and a method of packaging whereby an annular ring or protrusions mounted on the internal wail of the first chamber define an<br><br>
annular post slightly smaller in exterior diameter than the diameter of the center hole of the disc media to thus retain the disc media on the post in the container against movement in the plane of the disc media.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a container and a method of packaging whereby a protective insert is placed in the container before the disc media to protect the disc media from contact with the other materials.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a container and a method of packaging whereby a replaceable protective insert is placed in the container before the disc media to protect the disc media from contact with the other materials, which insert can be removed to access the ancillary materials and can be replaced after the ancillary materials are re-stored in the container and before the disc media is re-stored in the container.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a container and method of packaging whereby the disc media support members are removable so as to afford complete and unfettered access to the second chamber beneath the disc media.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a container and method of packaging whereby the first chamber is within the removable lid.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a container and method of packaging whereby the first chamber is within the removable lid and the disc media support member is a center post fixedly attached to and extending from the inside center of the lid.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a container and method of packaging whereby the removable lid has both a first chamber for the disc media and a second chamber for other materials and wherein there is a third chamber in the container.<br><br>
•A further object of this invention is to provide a container and method of packaging whereby the container has first and second chambers and the second chamber in which the other materials are stored has a second opening besides the opening through the first chamber.<br>
A further object of this invention is to provide container and a method of packaging whereby the container has a closure mechanism for the second opening that is separate and distinct from the closure mechanism for the opening into the second chamber through the first chamber.<br>
A further objeact of this invention is to provide a container and method of packaging whereby the container has an exterior shape for the first chamber such that the first chamber can serve as a base for the container.<br>
Yet another important object of this invention is to provide a container and method of packaging whereby the container has an exterior shape for the second chamber such that the second chamber can serve as a base for the container.<br>
A still further object of this invention is to provide a container and method of packaging for disc shaped media and other materials whereby the top and bottom covers are detachable and can be combined to create a smaller container for the disc shaped media.<br>
To accomplish these and other objects, the container of this invention in its preferred form is a cylinder provided with a removable lid and first and second chambers. The first chamber is immediately beneath the lid and has an inner structure defining circumferential support for disc media. The inner structure is a one-piece annular collar member, with an upstanding annular ring with an interior wall having a diameter slightly larger than the outside diameter of the disc media, and an annular Up that defines an annular opening having a diameter slightly smaller than the outside diameter of the disc media, such that the disc media sits on the annular lip and is<br><br>
restrained against movement in the plane of the disc media by the ring and aaainst movement in directions perpendicular to the plane of the disc media by the lip and the lid. The inner structure further includes an annular clip that extends over the rim of the container wall in nesting configuration, and which is locked on the container wall when the lid is affixed to the container, but which can be removed after the lid and disc media are removed to facilitate unencumbered access to the second chamber of the container beneath the first chamber. The second chamber is the same diameter as the first chamber and is of sufficient height to accommodate other materials that may or may not have relevance to the disc media. The bottom of the second chamber remote from the lid is flat and serves as the base of the container.<br>
In the preferred method of packaging, other materials are inserted into a first portion of an open ended cylindrical container through the open end, inner support elements are then inserted into the container through the open end, a protective element is then inserted into the container through the open end, disc media is then inserted into the container through the open end into a second portion of the container in protected engaging relation with the inner support elements within the container, and a lid is then applied to the container to both secure the disc media within the second portion of the container and to seal the container.<br>
The above, as well as additional objects, features and advantages of the invention will become apparent in the following detailed description.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
With reference now to the figures and in particular with reference to FIG. 1, there is shown a front view of the disc packaging device 10 of the present invention. As illustrated, disc packaging device 10 includes a lower base component or container 12 and an upper cover component or lid 14. Lower base component 12 and upper cover component 14 are utilized to fonn a generally cylindrical packaging device of dimension slightly larger than the disc shaped recording media to be stored. End plates 16 and 18 cooperate with lower base component 12 and upper cover component 14 to fully enclose the cylindrical packaging space defined thereby.<br>
The lower base component 12 of the embodiment of this invention shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 includes a side wall 20. The side wall can be constructed from either cardboard (i.e., natural fiber material) or plastic (i.e., man-made synthetic material) or other material suitably rigid for the base component to retain its shape, including metal, e.g., as in a vacuum sealed, canned product.<br>
The base component 12 can be designed to threadably receive the bottom plate 16 which is of conventional design, made of stiff cardboard, plastic, metal or some similarly rigid material and used as a cover-ail screw cap on a very wide variety of containers. Alternatively the bottom plate 16 can nest inside the side wall 20 where it is held by friction, stapling, gluing or some other means. The side wall 20 has an upper section 22 and the upper section 22 can be threaded to accommodate the upper cover component 14 although in the embodiment shown in FIGS 1 and 2 the cover is made of plastic and snaps on in a conventional manner.<br>
As best seen in FIG. 2, the upper section 22 is defined by an outer wall 24, an inner waD 26 and a rim 28. The cover component 14 has a side wall 30 defined by an outer wail 32, an inner wall 34 and a rim 36. The diameter of the inner wall 34 of the cover component is slightly greater than the diameter of the outer wall 24 of the base component. In the embodiment shown in FIGS.<br><br>
1 and 2, there is an inner structure 40 which provides circumferential support for a disc shaped media 42 stored within the packaging device 10. The structure 40 comprises an annular collar 44 having an annular ring 46 and an annular lip 48. The inner structure 40 nests within the lower base component 12. The annular collar 44 has an outer diameter greater than the diameter of the inner wall 26 of the base component such that the annular collar extends beyond the inner wall 26 and sits on top of the base rim 28. The annular ring 46 has an outer diameter less than the diameter of the inner wall 26, such that the annular ring nests inside the inner wall 26. The annular lip 48 has an inner diameter less than the outer diameter of the disc shaped media 42. Thus, the disc shaped media will rest on the annular lip, inside the annular ring. In this way, movement of the disc shaped media in the plane of the disc shaped media is precluded by the annular abutment 46. Movement of the disc shaped media perpendicular to its plane is prevented in one direction by the annular lip 48. When the cover component 14 is affixed to the base component 12, the cover plate 18 acts to preclude movement of.the disc shaped media in the opposite perpendicular direaction to the plane of the disc shaped media.<br>
In the embodiment disclosed in FIG. 2A, a protective member 50 is attached to the annular lip 48. The protective member can be made of plastic film or any other conventional material to provide a barrier between the disc shaped media and other materials 52 which can be stored in the base component 12 of the packaging device 10. The protective member can be pennanently affixed to the annular lip or it can be affixed at the time of assembly and shipment and removed by the consumer after purchase, i.e., at a time when further "rough handling" that would cause interaction between the disc shaped media and the other materials is less likely to occur.<br><br>
In an alternative embodiment disclosed in FIG, 2B, the protective element is removable and sized to seat on the annular lip 48 between the annular lip 48 and the disc shaped media. The protective element is round like the disc shaped media and has a central openina into which one"s finger can be inserted to engage, lift and remove the protective element and subsequently engage, lift and replace the protective eiemem.<br>
In an alternative embodiment disclosed in FIG. 2C, the protective element SOB is flexble and is removably inserted within the lower base component beneath the annular lip 48 and on top of the other materials 52 placed therein. The protective element is sized to correspond to the interior wall 26 and has a central opening into which one"s finger can be inserted to engage, lift and remove the protective element and subsequently engage, lift and replace the protective element. Alternatively, the protective element can be provided with a lift tab or some other conventional means whereby it can be grabbed and removed.<br>
In the alternative embodiment shown in FIGS. 3 and 3A, the inner structure 40 is modified. The annular collar 44 with annular ring 46 and annular lip 48 is replaced by discrete abutments 54 and discrete protrusions 56. Collectively, the abutments 54 and protrusions 56 are positioned within the lower base component 12 around the circumference of the inner wall 26 spaced below the rim 28, affixed to the inner wall 26, so as to perform the same function as the annular ring 46 and annular lip 48. Specifically, the abutments 54 preclude movement of the disc shaped media in the plane of the disc shaped media i.e., performing the same function as the annviiar ring 46. Similarly, the protrusions 56 are positioned about the inner wall 26 and collectively preclude movement of the disc shaped media in a direction perpendicular to plane of the disc shaped media i.e., performing the same function as the annular lip 48.<br><br>
FIG. 3B shows a further alternative embodiment wherein the disc shaped media is seated on the rim 28 and movement of the disc shaped media perpendicular to its plane is prevented in one direction by the rim 28. When the cover 14 is affixed to the base component 12, movement of the disc shaped media in the plane of the disc shaped media is precluded by the inner wall 34 of the cover 14 and inner surface 14a of the cover 14 acts to preclude movement of the disc shaped media in the second, opposite perpendicular direction to the plane of the disc shaped media.<br>
FIG. 3C shows a further alternative embodiment wherein the disc shaped media is seated on the outside surface 14b of the cover 14 and movement of the disc shaped media perpendicular to its plane is prevented in one direction by a supplementary cover 144 that snaps onto the cover 14. When the supplementary cover 144 is affixed to the cover 14, movement of the disc shaped media in the plane of the disc shaped media is precluded by the inner wail 144a of the supplementary cover 144 and the inner wall 144b of the supplementary cover 144 acts to preclude movement of the disc shaped media in the second, opposite perpendicular direction to the plane of the disc shaped media. The supplementary cover 144 can include a chamber 144d and a protective element 50b can be inserted to prevent contact between the disc shaped media and whatever materials 52a are placed in the chamber 144d.<br>
In the alternative embodiment seen in FIGS. 4 and 4A, the inner support structure 40 is replaced with an inner support structure 58 that provides center support for the disc shaped media as opposed to the circumferential support provided by inner structure 40. In the embodiment shown in FIGS. 4 and 4A, the alternative inner structure 58 includes an annular ring 60 and spokes 62 extending therefrom. As seen in FIG. 4A, the annular ring 60 has a raised portion 64 on which the disc media 42 sits. The spokes 62 each have a finger ponion 66 which extends upwardly and outwardly such that when the structure 58 is inserted into the base component 12,<br><br>
the fingers 56 frictionaiiy engage the inner wall 26 and sit on the upper rim 28. The structure 58 can include webbing between the fingers 56 (ala the webbing in a duck"s foot) comprised of a thin material to provide protection for the disc shaped media 42 from the other materials 52. Inside the annular ring 60 would be left open to allow the consumer, after removing the cover 14, to insert their finger into the annular ring and to thereby remove both the disc shaped media 42 and the structure 58.<br>
FIGS. 5 and 5A show a further alternative inner structure 68 comprising an annular collar 70 fi-om which fingers 72 extend inwardly. At the ends of the fingers 72 are upstanding projections 74. The annular collar 70 nests inside the inner wall 26 and sits on the rim 28 in the same maimer as the inner structure 40 in the embodiment shown in FIGS. 1 and 2. The upstanding projections 74 cooperate to provide a center support structure for the disc shaped media.<br>
As seen in FIGS. 6A and 6B, the fingers 72 in the embodiment shown in FIGS. 5 and 5A do not necessarily need to be suspended from an annular collar. Alternatively, they could be clipped to the side wall 20 as seen in FIG. 6A or they could be screwed into the side wall 20 as shown in FIG. 6B.<br>
In an alternative embodiment shown in FIG. 7, a center support structure is provided for the disc shaped media in the upper cover component 14. Specifically, projections 80 extend from the inside wall 82 of the end plate 18. These projections 80 cooperate to provide secure support for the disc shaped media in the cover component 14. A protective element 84 can be provided which is either removably nested within the cover as shown or which can be inserted at the time of [nanufacture and removed and discarded by the consumer after purchase. The cover 14 can<br><br>
engage the base component 12 in any variety of conventional ways, e.g., snap on, telescope on, screw on, etc.<br>
In a further alternative embodiment shown in, FIG. 7 A, the disc shaped media is encased within an envelope 84a made of plastic or some other suitable material and which is affixed to the inside wall 82 of the end plate 18. The envelope is either removably or permanently affixed, e.g., by gluing,-with double-sided tape, or by other conventional means. The envelope can itself constitute a re-useable packaging container for the disc shaped media that either remains affixed to the plate 18 or can be removed from the plate 18, e.g., so that the cover 14 can be discarded. Or the disc shaped media can be packaged within a packaging sleeve (not shown) all of which can then be inserted into the envelope and then removed from the envelope once the envelope is opened.<br>
FIGS. 8 and 8 A show further alternative embodiments of the present invention. In FIG. 8, the fact that the disc shaped media is stored within the cover component 14 allows for an alternative construction of the container 12. In this alternative embodiment, the cover 14 serves as the "base". The alternative base 90, in which the other materials, in this case, a doll 92, are stored, has an end wall structure 94 which frictionally engages the inner wall 96 and seals the chamber in the base 90. Alternatively, wall 94 can be provided with threads so that h will threadably engage corresponding threads on the inside wall 96. The cover 14 and base 90 can be attached in the same manner as heretofore been discussed in connection Avith other embodiments.<br>
In the embodiment showing in FIG. 8A, the cover 14 once agam carries the disc shaped media 42 and thereby allows the base 12 to be of a deformable construction 98. The deformable member 98 has a rigid internal support structure 100 which is designed to frictionally or threadably engage the cover 14.<br><br>
In the alternate embodiment shown in FIG. 9, the disc shaped media is stored in a first chamber 102 in the lid 14 defined by an annular support 40 similar in construction to the embodiment of FIG. 7, except that the lid includes a second chamber 104 defined by an outer wall 106 for other materials and the base 12 includes a third chamber 108. In the alternate embodiment shown in FIG. 10, which is similar in construction to the embodiment of FIG. 4, there is provided an additional opening 110 in the container 22 and a cover 116 for closing the opening 110. The cover 116 can be removed to gain access to the chamber 104 without removing the cover 14.<br>
In the alternative embodiment shown in FIGS. 11 and 11 A, an inner structure 40a is provided that is a slightly modified version of the inner structure 40 shown in FIG. 2, in that it includes an annular wall 45 that extends around the entire circumference of the anniilar collar 44 and engages the outer surface of the wall of the base 12, and the cover 14 is configured to engage not the base 12, but rather, the annular wail 45. An additional opening 110 is provided as in the embodiment of FIG. 10, and a cover 116a is provided that is a slightly modified version of the cover 116 of FIG. 10, in that it includes not only an outer annular wall 116b for engaging the outer surface of the wall of the base 12, but also an inner annular wall 116c for engaging the inner surface of the wall of the base 12. The circumferential dimension of the outer surface 116d of the wall 116b of the cover 116a is identical to the circumferential dimension of the outer surface 45 d of the wall 45, such that the covers 14 and 116a can be removed and the cover 14 which matingly engaged the wall 45 will matingly engage the outer wall 116b of the cover 116a, as shown in FIG. IIA In this way, as also shown in FIG. 11A the covers 14 and 116a can be used together as a mini-packaging device for the disc shaped media 42. In the embodiment shown, the inner wall 116c helps to securely retain the disc shaped media against movement. However, it is understood<br><br>
that the benefits of the invention could be achieved without such inner wail, or utilizing one of the other retaining methods disclosed herein.<br>
In the alternative embodiment shown in FIG. 12, the disc shaped media seats on the rim 28 as in the embodiment shown in FIG. 3B, but the cover 14x does not snap onto the base 12, but ra±er, threadabiy engages it. Furthermore, the bottom 12x of the base 12 is flared outwardly and contains internal threads that are of the same dimension as the internal threads of the cover 14x. The cover 116x includes mating external threads such that the cover II6x can be threaded into the flared bottom 12x of base 12. In this way, the covers 14x and 116x can be removed from the base 12 and threadabiy engaged to form a mini-packaging unit for the disc shaped media.<br>
In the alternative embodiments of FIGS. 12A and 12B, the need to flare out the bottom of the base 12 is eliminated. In FIG. 12A, the base 12y receives a bottom cover 116y that includes an overlapping portion II 7y, the outer surface 118y of which is of equal dimension to the outer surface II 8y of which is of equal dimension to the outer wall of the base 12y, such"that covers 14y and 11 y can be siidably engaged to form a mini-storage unit for the disc media. In FIG 12B, the base 122 has an external threaded portion 119z and an internal threaded portion 120z each of which extends beyond the center line "C" of the wall of the base 12z. In this way, when the covers 14z and 116z are removed, they can be threadabiy engaged to form a mini-storage unit for the disc media.<br>
FIG. 13 shows a further alternative embodiment, wherein the cover 244 nestingiy seats within the base 12 and the disc shaped media 42 is placed within the concave recess 246 of the cover 244. A seal 248 made of plastic or other suitable material is applied to the cover 244 to hold the disc shaped media within the cover 244 until the seal is removed by the user. The disc shaped media can be retained against movement withm the cover 244 as a result of contact with<br><br>
the side walls 250, bottom wall 252 and seal 248, or by utilization of any of the other methods taught herein.<br>
FIG. 14 shows a further alternative embodiment wherein the base 12 is a separately manufactured container of miscellaneous content, that includes a slightly concave end 251, the depth 252 of which exceeds the combined thickness of a disc shaped media 42 and a protective element 50 which are seated within the concave end 251 and held there by cover 14 which snaps onto base 12. In an alternate embodiment, a protective element is not used or the disc shaped media is packaged in an envelope (not shown).<br>
FIG. 15 shows a fiarther alternative embodiment wherein the disc shaped media is mounted and sealed within cover 14, e.g., as taught herein in connection with other embodiments, and cover 14 is attached to base 12 by paper packaging material skin 301 that binds the cover 14 and base 12 together. Cover 14 is separated from base 12 by pulling string 302 which tears die skin 301 and brakes the circumferential attachment between cover 14 and base 12.<br>
It would be understood that in each embodiment, a container device is provided in which disc shaped media can be packaged, distributed, displayed at retail and, if desired, restored with other materials and that, in effecting such usage, discrete chambers are provided for the disc media and for the other materials so as to prevent contact between the disc media and the other materials. In the embodiments shown in FIGS. 1 through 6B, the inner structure, whether it is the annular collar of FIG. 1, or the discretely positioned abutment/protrusion clips of FIG 3, or the upstanding rim in FIG. 3B, or the lid and supplemental lid of FIG. 3C, or the "spider" structure of FIG. 4, or the "trap" structure of FIG. 5, in each case is located in and helps define a first chamber in the lower base component 12. Underneath this first chamber is a second chamber. The first chamber receives and securely holds, despite repeated removal and re-packaging, the disc shaped<br><br>
media. The second chamber receives the other materials and keeps these materials separate from the disc shaped media. The need for a separate "jewel case" for the disc shaped media is thus completely eliminated.<br>
It would be understood that the shape of the container can be varied without departing from the scope of the present invention, e.g., the cylindrical base 12 can be square or rectangular so long as- the outer wall of the collar 40 corresponds and the collar includes spacers from the outer wall of the collar to the annular ring and annular lip of the present invention. Similar adjustments could be made to the other embodiments as would be apparent to those skilled in the art having reviewed this disclosure. The abutment/protrusions clips of FIG. 3 could be mounted on a non-cylindrical shaped base, as could the spider structure of FIG. 4 or the trap structure of HG. 5.<br>
It would be understood by those skilled in the art that the function of the annular ring of FIG. 1 or the abutments of FIG. 2 could be performed by an appropriately dimensioned inner wall 26 of the container 12.<br>
It would be further understood that while several methods of attaching the annular collar of FIG. 1, the abutment/protrusion clips of FIG. 2, the spider structure of FIG. 3 and the trap structure of FIG. 4 have been shown, those skilled in the art after having reviewed this disclosure could devise other means of attachment without departing from the scope of the present invention.<br>
It would be further understood by those skilled in the an that the device and method of this invention can accommodate one or more disc shaped media, e.g., through the insertion of protective elements therebetween.<br><br><br>
