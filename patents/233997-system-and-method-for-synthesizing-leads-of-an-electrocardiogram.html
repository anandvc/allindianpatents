				<td>SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR SYNTHESIZING LEADS OF AN<br>
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
 This invention is directed to synthesizing the leads of<br>
an electrocardiogram ("ECG") from three measured leads<br>
belonging to the set of routinely used leads, including the<br>
standard 12-lead ECG, and to visually present a body surface<br>
map ("BSM") based on an n-lead ECG that is derived from<br>
 three measured leads, and to predict the development of<br>
pathology, including acute myocardial infarction (more<br>
commonly known as a "heart attack") using the calculation of<br>
the ECG eigenvalues.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
 The ECG is a record of the electrical activity of the<br>
heart that is a commonly used diagnostic screening test in<br>
many medical settings. The standard ECG record includes 12<br>
lead waveforms, denoted as I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1,<br>
V2, V3, V4, V5, and V6, arranged in a specific order that is<br>
 interpreted by a physician using pattern recognition<br>
techniques. The ECG is acquired by specially trained<br>
technicians using specialized hardware and equipment. In<br>
the usual configuration, 10 electrodes are placed on the<br>
body torso to measure the electrical potentials that define<br>
 the standard 12 leads. Other lead systems have been tested<br>
over the years. These include the Frank vectorcardiogram<br>
("VCG") system, which uses 3 nearly orthogonal leads denoted<br>
as X, Y, and Z; 4 right chest leads, denoted by V3R, V4R,<br>
V5R, and V6R; and 3 left posterior leads, denoted as V7, V8,<br>
 and V9. No single manufacturer currently makes equipment<br>
that allows for the acquisition of all 22 leads. In order<br>
to acquire these leads, the technician must first remove the<br>
lead clips attached to the standard electrode placement<br>
sites and then re-attach them on the electrodes placed on<br>
the non-conventional sites. This requires at least 3<br>
separate tracing acquisitions and a total of 21 electrode<br>
placements.<br>
 It is usual in the practice of medicine to place<br>
patients with potential cardiac abnormalities on a rhythm<br>
monitor, a specially designed hardware equipment that<br>
displays only one ECG lead but which has the capability of<br>
measuring 3 different leads. There are some manufacturers<br>
 who have designed rhythm monitors that can display three<br>
leads as well but the usual display format is still one<br>
lead. With this equipment, the patient has 3 to 4<br>
electrodes placed on the body torso to acquire the 3<br>
different lead configurations. While the patient is<br>
 connected to the rhythm monitor, if a standard 12 lead ECG<br>
is ordered, the technician will then place all of the<br>
additional electrodes for the separate acquisition of the<br>
ECG. Thus, the efficiency of acquiring an ECG would be<br>
improved if there existed a process by which the standard 12<br>
 lead ECG, the 3 lead VCG, the 4 right chest leads, or the 3<br>
left posterior leads could be acquired instantaneously on<br>
demand from the rhythm monitor rather than the usual ECG<br>
machine, using fewer than standard number of electrodes.<br>
Nicklas, et al., in United States Patent No. 5,058,598,<br>
 invented a system for synthesizing ECG leads based on<br>
developing a patient-specific transform. This system could<br>
synthesize a 12 lead ECG based on receiving data from 3<br>
leads. However, this system required first acquiring a<br>
complete n-lead ECG from a patient in the usual manner in<br>
30 order to compute a patient specific transformation, which<br>
would then be applied subsequent ECG data acquired from that<br>
patient. This is cumbersome, as the resulting<br>
transformation is applicable to only one patient and needs<br>
to be stored in a medium that must be accessible for use<br>
during the patient's hospital stay. In addition, the<br>
Nicklas transformation may also have a time dependency,<br>
indicating that the patient transform may change with time<br>
 such that the transformation may need to be re-computed for<br>
each subsequent encounter with that patient for diagnostic<br>
accuracy.<br>
Dower, in United States Patent No. 4,850,370, used the<br>
Frank VCG 3 lead system to derive the 12 lead ECG, however,<br>
 this system is not conventional and is unfamiliar to most<br>
clinical staff. Dower also developed another unconventional<br>
lead configuration known as the EASI system, but this<br>
configuration requires the acquisition of 4 leads to derive<br>
the 12 lead ECG.<br>
 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention solves the aforementioned<br>
problems by using the mathematical techniques of abstract<br>
factor analysis and the simplex optimization algorithm to<br>
derive a universal transformation matrix that is applicable<br>
 to all patients and is independent of time. This universal<br>
transformation matrix is thus applicable when needed and<br>
does not require the acquisition of a complete n-lead ECG<br>
for each patient prior to its implementation.<br>
In order to do this, one first measures and digitizes<br>
 the voltage-time data for some set of ECG leads to define an<br>
ECG training set. Without limitation, examples of lead sets<br>
include the following formats:<br>
12 leads: I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6;<br>
15 leads: I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1, V2, V3, V4,' V5, V6,<br>
 X, Y, Z;<br>
15 leads: I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6,<br>
V7, V8, V9;<br>
16 leads: I, II, HI, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6,<br>
V3R, V4R, V5R, V6R;<br>
18 leads: I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6,<br>
V7, V8, V9, X, Y, 2;<br>
 19 leads: I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6,<br>
V7, V8, V9, V3R, V4R, V5R, V6R;<br>
22 leads: I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6,<br>
V7, V8, V9, V3R, V4R, V5R, V6R, X, Y, Z.<br>
Once the voltage-time data arrays have been acquired,<br>
 the abstract factor analysis ("AFA") technique is applied to<br>
each ECG voltage-time data array in a training set in order<br>
to minimize the error in the measured arrays. The final<br>
step is then to apply the simplex optimization technique<br>
("SOP") to the training set in order to derive a universal<br>
 transformation matrix applicable to all patients, and is<br>
time independent. This universal transformation matrix can<br>
then be applied to a standard measured 3 lead subsystem to<br>
derive the standard 12 lead ECG as well as other systems,<br>
and can generate at least 22 leads to enable a more accurate<br>
 interpretation of cardiac electrical activity. These<br>
derived ECG values are approximately 99% accurate when<br>
compared to observed lead measurements. The standard 3 lead<br>
system used to synthesize the 12 lead ECG are the measured<br>
I, aVF and V2 leads that belong to the standard 12-lead<br>
 system. This measured lead set is conventional and familiar<br>
to clinical staff and are thus easy to apply. Since this<br>
lead set approximates an orthogonal system, these lead<br>
vectors can be plotted against each other in a 3-dimensional<br>
space to yield a space curve whose properties can be<br>
 correlated with coronary pathologies. In addition, it is<br>
theoretically possible to use the universal transformation<br>
matrix of the invention to generate an n-lead ECG, where n<br>
is arbitrarily large.<br>
The techniques of abstract factor analysis and simplex<br>
optimization are well known in the applied mathematical art.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The full cycle of cardiac activity is represented by a<br>
wave known as the PQRST wave, defined by Einthoven, Arch.<br>
 ges Phys. 150:275, 1913, reprinted in Am. Heart J. 40:163,<br>
1950, translation by H.E. Huff and P. Sekelj. This wave<br>
represents full contraction and relaxation of the heart. An<br>
example of a PQRST wave is shown in FIG. 5. One complete<br>
heart cycle averages 1/72 seconds.<br>
 A flow chart illustrating the overall process of<br>
synthesizing and using the universal transformation matrix<br>
of the invention is depicted in FIG. 1. The first step,<br>
shown in block 101, is to acquire a sequence of digitized<br>
voltage-time data for one complete cycle for leads I, II,<br>
 and V2. Multiple data sets can be acquired, and each set<br>
typically contains upward to 300 measurements. From the<br>
known geometry of leads I and II, lead aVF can be calculated<br>
in block 102. The formula for generating lead aVF from<br>
leads I and II is shown at step 202 of FIG. 2.<br>
 Alternatively, a sequence of digitized voltage-time data for<br>
leads I, aVF and V2 can be measured directly, as indicated<br>
in block 103. Leads I, aVF and V2 are members of the set of<br>
leads that make up the standard 12-lead ECG and are very<br>
well known to clinical staff. The sequence of digitized<br>
 voltage-time measurements forms a matrix [V], which is a 3xM<br>
matrix, where M is the number of measurements in time, as<br>
indicated in block 104. Typically, 300 sequential time<br>
measurements are taken.<br>
The placement of leads I, aVF, and V2 on a human body<br>
is schematically illustrated in the three views depicted in<br>
FIGS. 9. These views are, respectively, a sagittal view, a<br>
frontal view, and a transverse view. This lead set was<br>
chosen for the following reasons.. As stated, these leads<br>
are well known to clinicians, nurses and ECG technicians.<br>
There is no need to place these leads on places that are<br>
unconventional, thus there is no need to research, develop<br>
and validate a new, unconventional lead configuration. In<br>
addition, these leads are approximately orthogonal. Any of<br>
the other 22 leads discussed above can be derived from the<br>
lead set of I, aVF, and V2. FIG. 10 depicts transverse<br>
planar view of the placement of the 13 V-leads (V1-V9, V3R-<br>
V6R) and the 3 Frank (X, Y, Z) leads (labeled as I, E, and<br>
M, respectively, in the drawing figure) of the 22-lead set<br>
that can be predicted from the measured lead set. A frontal<br>
view of the lead placements of FIG. 10 is shown in FIG. 11,<br>
which also depicts placements for leads RA, LA, RL, and LL.<br>
A total of 21 electrodes must be placed to capture the<br>
voltage-time data for 22 leads. The system of the present<br>
invention requires the placement of only 4 or 5 electrodes<br>
(depending on the design of the grounding electrode) to<br>
capture 3 leads from which the other 19 leads are derived.<br>
This has the advantages of cost savings, speed, minimizing<br>
errors from lead placement variability, and efficiency,<br>
particularly when sequential tracings are needed.<br>
Abstract Factor Analysis<br>
Abstract factor analysis ("AFA") is applied to the<br>
entire n-lead ECG measured data matrix in this invention to<br>
"pre-treat" the training set of ECGs, from which the<br>
transformation matrix is derived via simplex optimization,<br>
so as to minimize the inherent error in this training set.<br>
This is schematically illustrated in FIG. 2. The advantage<br>
of AFA is that this technique minimizes predictable error,<br>
such as a wandering baseline, baseline noise, and lead<br>
placement errors, from a data set, yielded an improved,<br>
measured, data set. A comparison of ECG values for lead I<br>
as measured and as predicted through AFA is shown in FIG. 3,<br>
showing close agreement.<br>
For the purpose of AFA, the ECG can be represented in<br>
an n-dimensional system by a linear sum of product terms.<br>
The standard 12-lead ECG is a system where n=12. At a<br>
particular time t, the 12-lead ECG can be represented as<br>
V(t) ==V1(t)L1 + V2(t)L2 + ... + Vn(t)Ln ,<br>
where V is a 12-dimensional vector, Vm is the potential at<br>
the mth lead, Lm is a unit vector in the 12-dimensional<br>
space, and t is time. The potential V(t) can also be<br>
represented by a set of orthogonal basis vectors {X} that<br>
spans the space:<br>
V(t) == Snm=1 Km(t) Xm .<br>
Abstract factor analysis identifies n, the number of factors<br>
influencing the data set, K, the transformation coefficient<br>
matrix, and X, the abstract lead-vector set.<br>
To perform AFA, we consider an NxM data matrix [V] of<br>
voltage-time measurements, where N is the number of leads,<br>
as indicated in block 105 of FIG. 1, and M is the number of<br>
data points. In AFA, a covariance matrix is diagonalized to<br>
yield a set of eigenvalues lj that can be ordered by<br>
magnitude. The covariance matrix can be defined as [Z] =<br>
[V]T[V], which is an MxM matrix with up to M eigenvalues, or<br>
it can be defined as [Z] = [V] [V]T, NxN matrix with up to N<br>
eigenvalues. Each eigenvalue lj corresponds to an<br>
orthogonal basis eigenvector Xj. The diagonalization<br>
procedure involves finding a matrix [Qj] that diagonalizes<br>
[Z] : [Z] [Qj] = lj[Qj]. In the context of ECGs, M is<br>
typically 300 measurements over one complete cycle.<br>
Multiple training sets of the NxM matrix are subjected to<br>
the AFA technique.<br>
From the application of AFA to the data set we find<br>
that 3 leads can account for almost all of the information<br>
content in an n-lead ECG, where n = 12 to 22 leads. This<br>
can be demonstrated by means of the cumulative percentage<br>
variance. The variance can be defined as:<br>
Var = lj / Snk=1 lk ,<br>
where n = 12 ... 22 and lj is the magnitude of the jth<br>
eigenvalue. The cumulative percentage variance is defined<br>
as<br>
Cum % Var = Sck=1 lk / Snk=1 lk ,<br>
where c = cth eigenvalue in the sequence of eigenvalues lj<br>
ordered by magnitude. The cumulative percentage variance is<br>
thus a measure of the information content of the system.<br>
FIG. 4 is a graph of the cumulative percentage variance as a<br>
function of lj and illustrates that most of the information<br>
content of the system is contained in the first 3<br>
eigenvalues. In fact, AFA demonstrates that 3 leads can<br>
account for approximately 99% of the information content of<br>
a 12-lead ECG. Thus, for a 12-lead system, the resulting<br>
transformation matrix [K] is a 3x12 matrix, indicated in<br>
block 106 of FIG. 1. Given a set of M voltage-time<br>
measurements for 3 leads, the full 12 lead set of<br>
measurements can be calculated by multiplying the<br>
transformation matrix [K] by the 3xM voltage-time data<br>
matrix for the 3 measured leads. This result can easily be<br>
generalized to a system with an arbitrary number of leads,<br>
hence our n-lead ECG terminology.<br>
The reduction of dimensionality of the factor space of<br>
the ECG should not be surprising since the standard 12-lead<br>
ECG already has built in redundancy. For example, the<br>
measurement of any 2 of the first 6 leads can be used to<br>
calculate the other 4 leads according to the following<br>
geometrically based formulae:<br>
Lead III = Lead II - Lead I<br>
Lead aVR = - 0.87x((Lead I + Lead II) / 2)<br>
Lead aVL = 0.87x((Lead I - Lead III) / 2)<br>
Lead aVF = 0.87x((Lead I + Lead III) / 2)<br>
The standard 12 lead ECG utilizes 12 PQRST<br>
configurations in a format from which the physician makes a<br>
diagnosis based on recognizing patterns in the plotted wave<br>
forms, as shown in FIG. 6. The ECG in FIG. 6 is the usual<br>
and customary 12-lead ECG and is a 12-dimensional<br>
representation of 12 voltage-time signals. As stated above,<br>
the inventor has verified through the application of AFA<br>
that ~ 99% of the information displayed thereon can be<br>
reproduced, from the measurement of just 3 leads. Since<br>
these leads are approximately orthogonal, they can be<br>
plotted against each other in 3-dimensional space, resulting<br>
in a spatial ECG loop. Virtually all of the information in<br>
a 12-lead ECG is in the 3-dimensional spatial ECG loop. In<br>
addition, the inventor has verified that the information<br>
content of lead configurations of up to 22 leads can be<br>
reproduced from just 3 measured leads. By increasing the<br>
lead space to 22 leads, clinicians can more accurately<br>
diagnose cardiac pathology, such as right heart infarction<br>
or posterior infarction.<br>
A typical 3-dimensional spatial loop for a normal male<br>
heart is shown in FIG. 7. This type of display can easily<br>
be built into a standard heart monitor, shown in FIG. 8,<br>
that incorporates the single wave configuration as currently<br>
exists. This spatial loop can also be printed for then<br>
patient medical record.<br>
Simplex Optimization<br>
The next step in the derivation of the universal<br>
transformation matrix of the present invention was<br>
application of the simplex optimization technique ("SOP") to<br>
the training set that was subjected to AFA, as illustrated<br>
in box 107 of FIG. 1. Since 3 leads account for almost all<br>
of the information of an n-lead ECG, SOP was applied to a 3-<br>
lead set comprised of {I, aVF, V2} to calculate to other<br>
leads.<br>
Simplex optimization, which is different from the<br>
simplex algorithm used for minimizing constrained linear<br>
systems, is a method for finding a maximum for a multiple<br>
variable function when the underlying function may be<br>
unknown. A simplex is a geometric figure defined by a<br>
number of points (n+1) that is one more than the number of<br>
variables. For a function of two variables z = f(x, y), one<br>
starts with 3 points {(x1,y1), (x2/y2), (x3,y3)}} and the<br>
value of the function is measured for those 3 points. These<br>
3 points are then labeled as "B", "N", and "W", for,<br>
respectively, the best, next best (or next worst), and worst<br>
values. Since we are seeking a maximum point, the best<br>
value has the greatest magnitude.<br>
The next point R for measuring the function f is<br>
determined by R = P + (P - W) , where P is the centroid of<br><br>
the figure when the worst value point is eliminated.<br>
Once the function has been measured for R, there are 3<br>
possibilities for the next step. First, if the value for R<br>
is better than the value for B, an expansion is attempted<br>
with a new point defined by E = P + 2(P - W). If the value<br>
for E is better than B, E is retained and the new simplex is<br>
defined by N, B, and E. If the value for E is not better<br>
than that for B, the expansion is said to have filed and the<br>
new simplex is defined by B, R, and N.<br>
Second, if the value for R is between that for B and N,<br>
the new simplex is defined to be B, R, and N, and the<br>
process is restarted.<br>
Finally, if the value for R is less desirable than that<br>
for N, a step was made in the wrong direction, and a new<br>
simplex should be generated. There are 2 possibilities. If<br>
the value for R is between that for N and W, the new point<br>
should be closer to R than W: CR = P + 0.5 (P - W) , and the<br>
new simplex is defined by B, N, and CR. If the value at R<br>
is worst than the value at W, then the new point should be<br>
closer to W than R: Cw=P-0.5(P-W). The new simplex is<br>
then defined by B, N, and Cw. The process is iterated until<br>
a maximum is found.<br>
For the case of the 3-lead ECG, the values of the other<br>
leads are calculated as functions of a 3-lead set,<br>
preferably {I, aVF, V2}. Thus, the simplex will be a 3-<br>
dimensional figure defined by 4 points that represent the<br>
starting values of {I, aVF, V2}. The results of this<br>
optimization were used to define an Nx3 universal<br>
transformation matrix [K] such that when multiplied by a<br>
vector comprising the 3 leads {I, aVF, V2} for a particular<br>
time yield a full n-lead ECG, as illustrated in block 108 of<br>
FIG. 1. In particular, the [K] matrix was calculated for<br>
the full PP cycle of the heart beat as well for segments<br>
within the PP cycle, such as the PR interval, the QRS<br>
interval, the SP interval, and the QT interval. The<br>
accuracy of the optimization was validated by comparing the<br>
derived values for the II, III, aVR, and aVL leads with<br>
measured values for those leads. A comparison of a<br>
synthesized ECG based on values derived from simplex<br>
optimization with a measured ECG is depicted in FIG. 16.<br>
Body Surface Maps<br>
As described above, the current n comprises up to 22<br>
leads placed around the body torso. Although the inventor<br>
has increased n from 12 to 22 leads, it is possible to use<br>
the method of the invention to derive more than 22 leads.<br>
By plotting the voltage-time data of multiple leads in a<br>
contour graph, a body surface map ("BSM") can be visualized.<br>
FIGS. 12a and 12b depict the chest lead placements from one<br>
electrode system soon to be commercial available. This<br>
system incorporates the placement of an 80 electrode vest<br>
around a patient's chest for voltage-time acquisition. A<br>
BSM of a patient derived from such a configuration is<br>
displayed in FIG. 13. This figure uses a color-coded<br>
contour drawn unwrapped as if hinged on the left lateral<br>
side so that the posterior surface is displayed in<br>
continuity next to the anterior surface. FIG. 14 displays a<br>
BSM measured from the end of the S-segment of the PQRST wave<br>
to the end of the T-segment ("ST-T"), in a patient with<br>
acute myocardial infarction ("MI") whose 12-lead scalar ECG<br>
showed only a depression in the ST portion of the PQRST<br>
wave. The BSM demonstrates a large posterior red area<br>
(indicated by the arrow in the figure) that indicates a<br>
posterior MI.<br>
The cost of the numerous leads required for a BSM and<br>
the time it takes to place the leads make BSMs prohibitive<br>
for application in an acute care setting. Sophisticated<br>
software and hardware is also required to analyze the BSM<br>
data, although recent technological advances make this<br>
process less cumbersome. However, BSMs are now easily-<br>
achievable using the method of the present invention, as any<br>
number of leads can be derived from just 3 measured leads<br>
using the universal transformation matrix of the present<br>
invention.. A BSM derived from a 3-lead system is displayed<br>
in FIG. 15.<br>
Clinical Significance of Eigenvalues<br>
Another clinical application of the method of the<br>
invention is that the cumulative percentage sum of the<br>
eigenvalues calculated from AFA demonstrate statistically<br>
significant differences between normal and MI ECGs. Thus,<br>
the eigenvalue contribution to the information space of the<br>
ECG is a marker for MI. In particular, by tracking the<br>
change in eigenvalue magnitudes over successive ECGs, a<br>
clinician can predict the onset of MI in a patient.<br>
In a study involving 20 patients, 10 men and 10 women,<br>
wherein half of each group displayed normal heart function<br>
and the other half of each group exhibited MI, and in which<br>
an 8-lead ECG was used, it was found that the two largest<br>
eigenvalues decreased in magnitude in going from normal<br>
heart function to MI, while the 6 smallest gained in<br>
magnitude. Although the decrease in magnitude of the two<br>
largest was not statistically significant, the increase in<br>
magnitude of the 6 smallest was statistically significant.<br>
FIG. 17a depicts a plot of the cumulative percentage sum of<br>
the normal and MI eigenvlaues for the two largest<br>
eigenvalues, here denoted by EVl and EV2. The plot displays<br>
a sharp break between the MI eigenvalues and the normal<br>
eigenvalues, wherein for normal function, this cumulative<br>
sum is greater than 97% of the total sum, while for MI the<br>
cumulative sum is less than 97% of the total value. More<br>
importantly, since these differences are statistically<br>
significant, the cumulative sum of the 6 smallest<br>
eigenvalues, here denoted by EV3 to EV6, shows a break<br>
between MI eigenvalues and normal eigenvalues. This is<br>
depicted in FIG 17b. As can be seen from the figure, the<br>
cumulative sum of the MI values range from about 3% up to<br>
about 9% of the total sum, while the cumulative sum of the<br>
normal values is less than 3% of the total sum.<br>
This has great clinical implications. As of the<br>
current time, the only markers for MI are measured through<br>
blood testing. This takes time, and has an associated cost.<br>
These blood test measurements are also NOT performed in real<br>
time. They are ordered by the physician when needed, but it<br>
takes time for the technician to arrive and take the blood<br>
sample from the patient. It is just not feasible to perform<br>
such chemical testing every 1-15 minutes. The eigenvalues<br>
of the ECG can now be measured on a beat to beat basis using<br>
a 3-lead bedside monitor, in real time, on demand, without<br>
the need of a technician. This invention would allow the<br>
immediate derivation of an n-lead ECG (e.g., 12-lead ECG)<br>
from a 3-lead monitor from which the eigenvalues can be<br>
calculated instantaneously. The eigenvalue percentage<br>
contribution is itself a marker for MI. This can be<br>
displayed along with the heart rate on any customary bedside<br>
monitor. Because this eigenvalue marker can be calculated<br>
on a beat-to-beat basis in less than a second with current<br>
conventional computer technology, the variability of the<br>
eigenvalues in time, and the rate of change of the<br>
eigenvalues, either by magnitude or percent contribution,<br>
are also markers for acute MI. This invention would allow<br>
the first known real-time electrophysiologic marker for<br>
acute MI. Naturally, any function utilizing the eigenvalues<br>
would accomplish the same purpose.<br>
The method of the invention can be implemented on any-<br>
computer system using any available programming language.<br>
One embodiment of the invention is implemented using<br>
Microsoft Visual Basic executing on a personal computer<br>
running the Windows operating system. The invention is not<br>
limited to this implementation, however, and implementations<br>
is other programming languages executing on other machines,<br>
such as the Mackintosh, or workstations running under the<br>
Unix operating system or variants thereof, such as Linux,<br>
are within the scope of the invention.<br>

illustrated in various preferred and alternate embodiments,<br>
such descriptions and illustrations are not to be construed<br>
to be limitations thereof. Accordingly, the present<br>
