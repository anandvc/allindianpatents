				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a sorbent conditioning and direct feed<br>
apparatus which is suitable for use in association with a fossil fuel-fired steam<br>
generator including, in particular, a circulating fluidized bed steam generator in a<br>
new utility unit application or a retrofit application in an existing utility unit.<br>
Limestone is a natural mineral principally comprised of calcium carbonate,<br>
CaCO3, and limestone is used as a desulfurizing or scrubbing medium in fluidized<br>
bed combustion units. In these units, combustion materials such as coal and the<br>
like are fluidized and combusted in a combustion vessel by contact with<br>
upflowing high temperature gasses. Limestone can be mixed with the combustion<br>
materials pnor to feeding of the combined fuel-sorbent mixture into the unit and<br>
the desulfunzation process takes place during combustion.<br>
Since the scrubbing or desulfunzation process is a chemical reaction, the<br>
proper stoichiometric ratio of limestone containing calcium carbonate to flue gas<br>
will produce the most efficient reaction. In order for the desulfunzation reaction<br>
to proceed efficiently and with minimal waste, the limestone must be conditioned<br>
such as by gnnding to produce a defined panicle size prior to use and it is<br>
particularly important in the fluidized bed combustion process to control<br>
limestone panicle size distribution so as to thereby ensure an efficient<br>
desulfunzation process. If the particles are too large, the desulfurization process<br>
will not be efficient because there is insufficient limestone panicle surface area to<br>
react with the flue gas. On the other hand, if the particles are too small, the<br>
limestone will be earned out of the vessel with the flue gas before it can react to<br>
remove the sulfur.<br>
Conventional limestone preparation systems often include a drying system<br>
having a cyclone or baghouse and typically comprise as well storage hoppers,<br>
conveyors, crushing and grinding machines and, in some configurations, vibrating<br>
screens. Such conventional systems effect particle size reduction of the limestone<br>
in discrete steps including, for example, multiple passes of the limestone particles<br>
through size reduction units which is typically performed to progressively reduce<br>
the particle size from a relatively larger or coarse panicle size to a relatively<br>
smaller or fine particle size suitable for introduction into the combustion vessel.<br>
Thus, it can be appreciated that such conventional limestone preparation systems<br>
generally have a complexity which contributes significantly to their cost and the<br>
number of processing operations and transport paths between the various<br>
components adds to the operational complexity and maintenance costs of such<br>
systems.<br>
Conventional limestone storage and feed systems also typically require<br>
separate preparation and/storage facilities for the raw sorbent and these facilities<br>
add to the capital cost of the utility unit. Also, such facilities may be sited several<br>
hundred meters from the combustor of the utility unit, thus adding to the overall<br>
space requirements of the utility unit.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
To thus summarize, a need has been evidenced in the prior art for a sorbent<br>
conditioning and direct feed apparatus that would be particularly suited for use in<br>
effecting the pulverization of sorbent material such as, for example, limestone,<br>
and the feed thereof directly to a steam generator including, in particular, a<br>
circulating fluidized bed steam generator.<br>
It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a new and<br>
improved sorbent conditioning and direct feed apparatus that is particularly suited<br>
for use in effecting the pulverization of sorbent material such as, for example,<br>
limestone, and the feed thereof directly to a steam generator including,in<br>
particular, a circulating fluidized bed steam generator.<br>
Yet a further object of the present invention is to provide such an<br>
improved sorbent conditioning and direct feed apparatus which is suitable for<br>
installation in new steam generator facilities including, in particular, a circulating<br>
fluidized bed steam generator facility.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide such an improved<br>
sorbent conditioning and direct feed apparatus which is capable of being<br>
retrofitted in connection with existing steam generator facilities including, in<br>
particular, a circulating fluidized bed steam generator facility.<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, these and other<br>
objects of the present invention are achieved by an improved sorbent conditioning<br>
and direct feed apparatus which is suitable for installation in new steam generator<br>
facilities including, in particular, a circulating fluidized bed steam generator<br>
facility and which is capable of being retrofitted in connection with existing steam<br>
generator facilities including, in particular, a circulating fluidized bed steam<br>
generator facility.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, there is thus provided a sorbent<br>
conditioning and direct feed apparatus operable to effect the direct feeding of a<br>
conditioned solid sorbent to the combustor. The apparatus includes a raw solid<br>
sorbent storage means and a particle size reducing means for reducing the particle<br>
size of solid sorbent supplied thereto from the raw solid sorbent storage means<br>
from a relatively larger coarse particle size to a relatively smaller fine particle.<br>
Also, the apparatus includes transport for transporting solid sorbent which<br>
has been conditioned by the particle size reducing means to the combustor in a<br>
manner in which, on average, at least ninety percent (90%) of the conditioned<br>
solid sorbent are delivered from the particle size reducing means to the combustor<br>
in less than thirty (30) minutes) following their size reduction, whereby<br>
conditioned solid sorbent is fed to the combustor with substantially no<br>
intermediate storage of the solid sorbent between the raw solid sorbent storage<br>
means and the transport means.<br>
According to one aspect of the preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the combustor is a fluidizcd bed combustor. According to another<br>
aspect of the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the transport means<br>
is a fuel feed transport means operable to transport as well conditioned solid fossil<br>
fuel to the fluidized bed combustor, whereby the conditioned solid sorbent and the<br>
conditioned solid fossil fuel are fed as a mixture to the fluidized bed combustor.<br>
Additionally, the sorbent conditioning and direct feed apparatus preferably<br>
comprises control means operativcly connected to the raw solid sorbent storage<br>
means, the particle size reducing means, and the transport means for controlling<br>
the feed of conditioned solid sorbent to the fluidized bed combustor in accordance<br>
with a predetermined sorbent feed regime.<br>
According to yet another aspect of the preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the sorbent conditioning and direct feed apparatus further<br>
comprises means for sensing an operating condition of the fluidized bed<br>
combustor operatively connected to the control means, the control means being<br>
operable to control the feed of conditioned solid sorbent to the fluidized bed<br>
combustor in response to a sensed operating condition of the fluidized bed<br>
combustor. The means for sensing an operating condition of the fluidized bed<br>
combustor can be operable to sense a sulfur concentration in the fluidized bed<br>
combustor.<br>
According to a further additional aspect of the preferred embodiment of<br>
the present invention, the particle size reducing means is a roller mill.<br>
Alternatively, the particle size reducing means is a roll crusher. Also, according<br>
to a supplemental aspect of the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
conditioned solid fossil fuel is subjected to a separate particle size reduction<br>
operation prior to the supply thereof to the transport means and the fluidized bed<br>
combustor is supplied by the transport means with a mixture of conditioned solid<br>
fossil fuel and conditioned solid sorbent. The transport means may alternatively<br>
be configured as a pneumatic transport assembly operable to pneumatically<br>
transport conditioned sorbent to the steam generator from any air swept mill or<br>
crusher or as a mechanical transport assembly.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Referring now to Figure 1 there is shown a typical circulating fluidized<br>
bed steam generator to which the sorbent conditioning and direct feed apparatus of<br>
the present invention has particular application. Crushed fuel and sorbent are<br>
normally fed to the lower portion of a combustor 12. Typically the fuel and<br>
sorbent material are fed to a chute (not shown) that is disposed at approximately a<br>
60 degree angle from horizontal. Thus, the fuel and sorbent pass along the chute<br>
and into the combustor 12. Primary air is supplied to the bottom of the combustor<br>
through an air distributor 14 with secondary air fed through one or more air ports<br>
at various elevations in the lower part of the combustor. Combustion takes place<br>
throughout the combustor 12 which is filled with bed material. Flue gas and<br>
entrained solids leave the combustor 12 and enter one or more cyclones 16 where<br>
the solids are separated and fall to a seal pot 18. From the seal pot 18, the solids<br>
are recycled to the combustor 12. Optionally, some solids may be diverted<br>
through an ash control valve 20 to a fluidized bed heat exchanger 22. Flue gas<br>
leaving the cyclone 16 passes to a convective pass 24 and then to an air heater, a<br>
bag house or an electrostatic precipitator, and fan (not shown). The solids in the<br>
combustor 12 are periodically allowed to pass out of the combustor 12 by draining<br>
these hot solids through an ash cooler 30 or, in lieu of the ash cooler 30, an ash<br>
screw may be provided to periodically remove the hot solids.<br>
One preferred embodiment of the sorbent conditioning and direct feed<br>
apparatus of the present invention is illustrated in the schematic arrangement of<br>
Figure 2 in which limestone, which has not yet been subjected to a particle size<br>
reduction treatment, is conditioned into a final particle size distribution in which<br>
the conditioned limestone can be fed into a steam generator. The steam generator<br>
can be, for example, a circulating fluidized bed steam generator such as the one<br>
illustrated in Figure 1 having a combustor 12. Limestone is supplied from a<br>
conventional limestone storage facility 102 to a feed hopper 104. Limestone is<br>
then fed by the feed hopper 104 onto a weigh scale belt 106 which is part of a<br>
gravimetric feeder device 108 and is moved thereby to fall through a chute 110<br>
into the selected particle size reducing apparatus 112 which may be configured as,<br>
for example, a roller mill or a roll crusher. The particle size reducing apparatus<br>
112 is driven by a conventional prime mover (not shown) which is controllable as<br>
will be presently described.<br>
A conventional rotary valve 114 controls the supply of the conditioned<br>
limestone having a size below a predetermined size which has exited the particle<br>
size reducing apparatus 112 via an outlet 116. The rotary valve 1 14 controls the<br>
supply of conditioned limestone to a pneumatic transport assembly 118 which<br>
transports the conditioned limestone to feed inlets of the combustor 12. One<br>
configuration of the panicle size reducing apparatus 112 which can<br>
advantageously make use of a transport arrangement of the type including the<br>
rotary valve 114, the outlet 116. and the pneumatic transport assembly 118 could<br>
be, for example, a roll crusher. Alternatively, in accordance with a variation of<br>
the sorbent conditioning and direct feed apparatus of the present invention, an air<br>
swept arrangement having conventional features may be deployed in lieu of the<br>
rotary valve 114, the outlet 116, and the pneumatic transport assembly 118 to<br>
effect the transport of the conditioned sorbent from the particle size reducing<br>
apparatus 112 to the combustor 12. One configuration of the particle size<br>
reducing apparatus 112 which can advantageously make use of a transport<br>
arrangement of the type including an air swept arrangement could be, for example,<br>
a roller mill. This air swept arrangement could include, for example, a suitable<br>
conventional heated air take-off duct assembly to convey heated air from the<br>
combustor 12 to the particle size reducing apparatus 112 and a suitable<br>
conventional return duct assembly to convey the heated air, with the conditioned<br>
sorbent entrained therewith, from the particle size reducing apparatus 112 to the<br>
combustor 12.<br>
Conditioned solid fuel such as, for example, crushed coal, is supplied<br>
separately to the combustor 12 from a solid fuel feed supply 120.<br>
A limestone feed system, control unit 122 controls the limestone feed<br>
operation through the various assemblies just noted to ultimately feed conditioned<br>
limestone to the circulating fluidized bed steam generator. The limestone feed<br>
system control unit 122 is connected via a connector 124 to the drive motor which<br>
drives the belt of the weight scale belt 106 of the gravimetric feeder device 108<br>
and is connected via a connector 126 to the weight assessment sub-assembly of<br>
the gravimetric feeder device 108 for receiving from the connectors 124 and 126<br>
signals relating to the output rate and the quantity (i.e., volume by weight) of the<br>
limestone being fed by the gravimetric feeder device 108 to the particle size<br>
reducing apparatus 112.<br>
A connector 128 connects the limestone feed system control unit 122 to<br>
the dnve motor of the particle size reducing apparatus 1 12 and a connector 130<br>
connects the limestone feed system control unit to an optional rotary valve 114.<br>
The limestone feed system control unit can. thus, in connection with selected<br>
particle size reducing scenarios, control the operation of the particle size reducing<br>
apparatus 112 and the supply rate of the rotary valve 1 14. In accordance, for<br>
example, with one typical control regime, as the limestone feed system control<br>
unit 122 controls the speed of the particle size reducing apparatus 112 to thereby<br>
increase the output of the conditioned limestone, the rotary valve 114 is controlled<br>
to increase the supply rate of conditioned limestone to the fuel feed transporter<br>
118.<br>
A conventional sulfur level sensing device 132 is located relative to the<br>
combustor 12 for continuously sensing or monitoring the sulfur level in the flue<br>
gas, whereby the sulfur level sensing device 132 may be located, for example, on<br>
the flue gas outlet stack. The sulfur level sensing device 132 is connected via a<br>
connector 134 to the limestone feed system control unit 122 for providing signals<br>
thereto concerning the sensed sulfur level in the flue gas. A moisture control<br>
assembly 136 is provided to control the moisture content of the conditioned<br>
limestone to a desired level. The moisture control assembly 136 preferably<br>
selectively effects drying of the raw limestone upstream of the panicle size<br>
reducing apparatus 112 by, for example, drying the raw limestone stored in the<br>
limestone storage facility 102 to a predetermined feed moisture of, say, 1 to 10<br>
such that the conditioned limestone fed to the combustor 12 has the desired<br>
moisture content. The moisture control assembly 136 can be configured with a<br>
conventional externally powered or fueled drying device such as, for example, a<br>
gas-fired drying device which applies heated air to the raw limestone to effect<br>
drying thereof. Preferably, however, the moisture control assembly 136 is<br>
configured to use process heat generated in connection with the operation of the<br>
steam generator and, to this end, the moisture control assembly 136 may include<br>
an optional externally powered heater 138 or a duct and damper sub-assembly<br>
which communicates the particle size reducing apparatus 112 with the combustor<br>
12 such that process heat from the combustor 12 can be selectively applied to the<br>
limestone in the particle size reducing apparatus 112 to effect the drying thereof.<br>
The sorbent conditioning and direct feed apparatus of the present invention<br>
advantageously permits a process heat arrangement of this type to be used in a<br>
cost effective manner in that the sorbent conditioning and direct feed apparatus<br>
can be located sufficiently proximate to the combustor 12 - that is, typically less<br>
than 50 meters therefrom - to permit process heat to be transferred to the particle<br>
size reducing apparatus 112 in a cost favorable manner. In contrast, in a<br>
conventional limestone storage and conditioning arrangement, the limestone<br>
storage facility which performs the limestone storage function of the limestone<br>
storage facility 102 is typically located several hundred meters from the<br>
combustor and it is thus not cost justifiable to deliver process heat from the<br>
combustor over the several hundred meter distance.<br>
The operation of the particle size reducing apparatus 112 to effect a size<br>
reduction of the limestone is controlled in response to certain signals received by<br>
the limestone feed system control unit 122 from the various components<br>
connected thereto. Thus, for example, in accordance with one exemplary<br>
limestone feed control regime, the limestone feed system control unit 122 receives<br>
signals from the sulfur level sensing device 132 concerning the sensed sulfur level<br>
in the flue gas and the limestone feed system control unit 122 evaluates these<br>
signals to determine the need for feeding limestone to the combustor. When the<br>
limestone feed system control unit 122 determines a need to supply the prepared<br>
limestone particles to the combustor 12. the limestone feed system control unit<br>
122 controls the feed hopper 104 to feed raw untrammeled limestone onto the<br>
gravimetric feed device 108. The operation of the gravimetric feed device 108 is<br>
also controlled by the limestone feed system control unit 122 to effect the supply<br>
of a predetermined volume (by weight) of raw untrammeled limestone to the<br>
particle size reducing apparatus 112. The particle size reducing apparatus 112<br>
then performs a size reduction operation on the limestone supplied thereto and the<br>
thus conditioned limestone panicles exit the particle size reducing apparatus 112<br>
into the pneumatic transport assembly 118. If the particle size reducing 112 is<br>
configured, for example, as a conventional roller mill, the optional rotary valve<br>
114 is omitted and the conditioned limestone particles will exit the roller mill<br>
directly to the pneumatic transport assembly 118 as a function of the classification<br>
operation of the roller mill. The thus supplied limestone particles are then<br>
transported to the combustor 1 2. In connection with a sensing operation by the<br>
sulfur level sensing device 132 which indicates that the desired sulfur level in the<br>
combustor 12 has been achieved, the limestone feed system control unit 122<br>
controls the system to reduce or increase the supply of prepared limestone.<br>
As shown in Figure 3, the gravimetric feed device 108 is preferably<br>
configured as a single belt feeder 240 for sorbent. Disposed at spaced intervals<br>
along the belt feeder 240 is a first belt scale 242. Disposed upstream respectively<br>
from the belt scale 242 is the feed hopper 204 which feeds sorbent to the belt<br>
feeder 240. A programmable logic controller 250 receives inputs from the first<br>
belt scale 242. The sorbent will be dumped off the belt feeder 240 at the right (as<br>
shown in the drawing) hand end of the belt feeder 240. A programmable logic<br>
controller 250 is optionally provided to which is supplied an input (the weight)<br>
from the belt scale 242. The supply of sorbent to the belt feeder 240 from the feed<br>
hopper 204 is controlled by a rotary valve 254.<br>
The rotary valve 254 is controlled by a motor 256 which is in turn<br>
controlled by the programmable logic controller 250. The control of the motor<br>
256 driving the rotary valve 254 determines the actual amount of sorbent<br>
delivered to the belt feeder 240. The programmable logic controller 250 compares<br>
the actual feed rate to the intended or desired gravimetric feed rate. It will be<br>
understood that a motor 260 is provided to drive the continuous belt feeder 240<br>
and that this motor 260 is driven at a speed and/or periods of time corresponding<br>
to the desired rate of delivery of sorbent to the limestone conditioning operation<br>
and from there, to the combustion process in the circulating fluidized bed steam<br>
generator. More specifically, the belt scale 242 sends a signal to the motor 260<br>
and thus controls the motor 260. The signal from the programmable logic<br>
controller 250 to the motor 260 is a function of the weight of the sorbent added to<br>
the belt feeder 240 per unit of time. It will also be seen that the relative rate of<br>
sorbent feed is controlled by the motor 256 controlling the valve 254 and that this<br>
control is achieved by the programmable logic controller 250.<br>
In some forms of the invention, the programmable logic controller 250<br>
may be a dedicated programmable logic controller. The programmable logic<br>
controller 250 is a common commercial commodity and typical dedicated<br>
programmable logic controllers. In other forms of the invention the<br>
programmable logic controller 250 may be part of the distributed control system<br>
of the plant in which the fluidized bed steam generator is located.<br>
Thus, the one embodiment of the sorbent conditioning and direct feed<br>
apparatus illustrated in Figure 2 is operable to effect the direct feeding of a<br>
conditioned solid sorbent to the combustor 12. The apparatus includes a raw solid<br>
sorbent storage means in the form of the limestone storage facility 102 and a<br>
particle size reducing means for reducing the particle size of solid sorbent<br>
supplied thereto from the raw solid sorbent storage means from a relatively larger<br>
coarse particle size to a relatively smaller fine particle size in the form of the<br>
particle size reducing apparatus 112. Also, the apparatus includes transport means<br>
in the form of the fuel feed transporter 118 for transporting solid sorbent which<br>
has been conditioned by the particle size reducing means to the combustor in a<br>
manner in which, on average, at least ninety percent (90%) of the conditioned<br>
solid sorbent are delivered from the particle size reducing means to the combustor<br>
in less than thirty (30) minutes) following their size reduction, whereby<br>
conditioned solid sorbent is fed to the combustor with substantially no<br>
intermediate storage of the solid sorbent between the raw solid sorbent storage<br>
means and the transport means. Thus, it is contemplated that the present invention<br>
encompasses (a) those material feed apparatus configured to deliver the entirety of<br>
the conditioned solid sorbent directly to the combustor without any diversion<br>
enroute of a portion of the conditioned solid sorbent; and (b) those material feed<br>
apparatus configured to permit an insubstantial enroute diversion of the<br>
conditioned solid sorbent during its travel between the particle side reducing<br>
means and the combustor. An example of an insubstantial enroute diversion of<br>
the conditioned solid sorbent is the removal of a sample size portion of the<br>
conditioned solid sorbent to permit testing or quality control measures to be<br>
performed on the removed sample size portion. Another example of an<br>
insubstantial enroute diversion of the conditioned solid sorbent is the creation of<br>
an operational reserve of the conditioned solid sorbent designed to accommodate<br>
inline feed variations in the mass flow of the conditioned solid sorbent and this<br>
volume of this operational reserve is considered to be many orders of magnitude<br>
less than the storage volume of conditioned solid sorbent which is typically stored<br>
in a dedicated large volume silo or other structure in connection with conventional<br>
conditioned solid sorbent preparation and feed arrangements.<br>
As shown in Figure 4 in conjunction with, respectively, Figures 5A and<br>
5B, a roll crusher can be provided as the preferred configuration of the particle<br>
size reducing apparatus 112 for effecting the size reduction of the limestone<br>
particles. As seen in one variation of such a roll crusher embodiment shown in<br>
Figure 5A, this variation of the one embodiment of the sorbent conditioning and<br>
direct feed apparatus includes a roll crusher 412 for effecting the particle size<br>
reduction of the limestone. The roll crusher 412, as seen in more detail in Figure<br>
4, comprises a feed area 414 for feeding raw untrammeled limestone from a raw<br>
material feed arrangement 416, a first pair of grinding rolls 418, 420 and a second<br>
pair of grinding rolls 422, 424. The first pair 418, 420 of grinding rolls and the<br>
second pair 422, 424 of grinding rolls are each driven by independent drive means<br>
(not shown) such as electric motors. The raw untrammeled limestone is fed from<br>
the feed area 414 by gravity. The first pair of grinding rolls 418, 420 comprises<br>
opposing rotating rolls 418, 420 which each rotate about a horizontal axis in a<br>
respective direction of rotation opposite to that of the other grinding roll. The<br>
rolls 418, 240 form therebetween a first nip 430, which is adjustably or fixedly set<br>
in dependence upon the raw untrammeled limestone particle size.<br>
The second pair of grinding rolls 422, 424 comprises opposing rotating<br>
rolls which each rotate about a horizontal axis in a respective direction of rotation<br>
opposite to that of the other grinding roll. The rolls 422, 424 are separated by a<br>
second nip 434, which is based upon the final product particle size distribution<br>
desired. A preferred particle size distribution is comprised of particles smaller<br>
than 2 mm and, generally, smaller than J mm, and having a mean size of about<br>
300 microns. Preferably, the panicle size distribution is produced with the nip<br>
434 between the second set of rolls 422, 424 in the range of about 2 to 3 mm.<br>
Each of the grinding rolls of the first pair 418, 420 and the second pair<br>
422, 424 of grinding rolls rotate at different velocities relative to its opposed<br>
paired grinding roll to produce a shear in the particles as they pass into and<br>
through the nip 430 and the nip 434. Raw untrammeled limestone is fed by the<br>
raw material feed arrangement 416 into the feed area 414. The limestone then<br>
falls into the nip area 430 of the first pair of rolls 418, 420. Grinding of the<br>
limestone particles occurs in the nip 430 and, as the limestone travels<br>
therethrough, the compression and shear imparted by the rolls 418, 420, on the<br>
limestone causes the particles to work against each other thereby breaking down<br>
or fracturing the crystalline structure. The particle size distribution of the product<br>
is controlled in that, the larger the nip, the less the work that is done on the<br>
limestone particles, while, the smaller the nip, the greater the work that is done on<br>
the limestone particles. As the limestone passes beyond the first nip 430, it falls<br>
into the second nip 434 at which it is subjected to further size reduction by the<br>
second pair of grinding rolls 422, 424. The one variation of the roll crusher<br>
embodiment of the sorbent conditioning and direct feed apparatus shown in<br>
Figures 4 and 5A also includes, in lieu of the pneumatic transport assembly 118<br>
described with respect to Figure 2, a fuel feed transporter 436 for feeding the<br>
conditioned limestone to the circulating fluidized bed steam generator along with<br>
raw or conditioned solid fuel such as. for example, raw untrammeied coal or<br>
crushed coal, which is supplied from a solid fuel feed supply. The fuel feed<br>
transporter 436 may be configured, for example, as a conventional mechanical<br>
transporter in the form of, for example, an endless belt conveyor. The conditioned<br>
limestone particles exiting the second pair of grinding rolls 422, 424, having thus<br>
been reduced in size to achieve the desired particle size distribution, are then<br>
released into the pneumatic transport stream of the pneumatic transport assembly<br>
436 in a metered manner by means, for example, of a conventional rotary valve<br>
arrangement, and supplied thereby along with the solid fuel into the circulating<br>
fluidized bed steam generator.<br>
As seen in another variation of such a roll crusher embodiment shown in<br>
Figure 5B, this variation of the one embodiment of the sorbent conditioning and<br>
direct feed apparatus includes all of the features of the one roll crusher<br>
embodiment variation shown in Figure 5A with the addition, in this other<br>
variation, of a drying arrangement 438 for effecting at least some reduction in the<br>
moisture content of the raw limestone prior to its feed into the roll crusher. The<br>
drying arrangement 438 may be configured, for example, as a conventional<br>
tempered air drying arrangement which diverts a portion of the air heated in the<br>
circulating fluidized bed steam generator and, by means of a conventional rotary<br>
dryer, passes the heated air into contact with the raw limestone with the now<br>
cooler heated air being returned via a return loop to the steam generator.<br>
A further preferred embodiment of the sorbent conditioning and direct feed<br>
apparatus of the present invention is illustrated in the schematic arrangement of<br>
Figure 6 in which limestone, which has not yet been subjected to a particle size<br>
reduction treatment, is conditioned into a final particle size distribution in which<br>
the conditioned limestone can be fed into a direct fired steam generator such as a<br>
pulverized coal combustor having comer mounted or wall mounted burners for<br>
directly injecting pulverized coal and conditioned limestone into the combustor.<br>
The steam generator shown in Figure 6 is exemplarily illustrated as a conventional<br>
pulverized coal direct fired boiler 500.<br>
Limestone is supplied from a conventional limestone storage facility 502<br>
to a feed hopper 504. Limestone is then fed by the feed hopper 504 onto a weigh<br>
scale belt 506 which is part of a gravimetric feeder device 508 and is moved<br>
thereby to fall through a chute 510 into the selected limestone size conditioning<br>
apparatus such as, for example, a roller mill 512. The roller mill 512 is driven by<br>
a conventional prime mover (not shown) which is controllable as will be presently<br>
described.<br>
The roller mill 512 may optionally include a dynamic classifier or a static<br>
classifier for classifying the limestone particles conditioned by the roller mill.<br>
Merely for the purpose of illustrating such an option, the sorbent conditioning and<br>
direct feed apparatus shown in Figure 6 is provided with a dynamic classifier 514,<br>
whose rate of rotation is controllable as will be presently described, which<br>
classifies the limestone in the roller mill 512 such that a portion of the conditioned<br>
limestone having a size below a predetermined size are permitted to exit the roller<br>
mill 512 via an outlet 516 while another portion of the limestone having a size<br>
above the predetermined size are returned to the grinding area of the roller mill<br>
512 for further size reduction. The outlet 516 communicates with a conventional<br>
pneumatic transport assembly 518 operable to pneumatically transport conditioned<br>
limestone from the roller mill 512 to the plurality of burners at which the<br>
conditioned limestone is mixed with pulverized coal during direct firing thereof<br>
into the pulverized coal direct fired boiler 500. The conditioned limestone travels<br>
from the outlet 516 via the pneumatic transport assembly 518 to the pulverized<br>
coal direct fired boiler 500 at which it is combined with the pulverized solid fuel<br>
such as, for example, pulverized coal, which is supplied from a solid fuel feed<br>
supply 520. The pulverized coal is itself supplied to the solid fuel feed supply 520<br>
in a separate solid fossil fuel preparation process which may include, for example,<br>
size reduction of raw untrammeled coal in a conventional pulverizer 521. The<br>
conventional pulverizer 521 uses some combination of impact, attrition and<br>
crushing to reduce a solid fuel to a particular particle size. Several types of<br>
pulverizer mills can be employed for the pulverization of the solid fuel, which<br>
may be, for example, coal, to a particulate size appropriate for firing in a furnace.<br>
These can comprise, for example, ball-tube mills, impact mills, attrition mills, ball<br>
race mills, and ring roll or bowl mills. Most typically, however, bowl mills are<br>
employed for the pulverization of the solid fuel to allow for direct firing of the<br>
pulverized fuel entrained in an air stream.<br>
A limestone feed system control unit 522 controls the limestone feed<br>
operation through the various assemblies just noted to ultimately feed conditioned<br>
limestone to the pulverized coal direct fired boiler 500. The limestone feed<br>
system control unit is connected via a connector 524 to the drive motor which<br>
drives the belt of the weight scale belt 506 of the gravimetric feeder device 508<br>
and is connected via a connector 526 to the weight assessment sub-assembly of<br>
the gravimetric feeder device 508 for receiving from the connectors 524 and 526<br>
signals relating to the output rate and the quantity (i.e., volume by weight) of the<br>
limestone being fed by the gravimetric feeder device 508 to the roller mill 512.<br>
A connector 528 connects the limestone feed system control unit 522 to<br>
the grinding bowl drive motor of the roller mill 512 and a connector 530 connects<br>
the limestone feed system control unit to the dynamic classifier 514. The<br>
limestone feed system control unit thus controls the speed of the roller mill 512<br>
and the speed of the dynamic classifier 514. In accordance, for example, with one<br>
typical control regime, as the limestone feed system control unit controls the<br>
speed of the roller mill 512 to thereby increase the grinding capacity of the<br>
limestone, the speed of the dynamic classifier 514 is reduced.<br>
In lieu of the sulfur level sensing performed by the sulfur level sensing<br>
device 132 described with respect to the one embodiment of the sorbent<br>
conditioning and direct feed apparatus shown in Figure 2, the further embodiment<br>
of the sorbent conditioning and direct feed apparatus shown in Figure 6 does not<br>
perform any real time sulfur sensing but. instead, operates to control the feed of<br>
conditioned limestone to the pulverized coal direct fired boiler 500 in accordance<br>
with a pre-programmed limestone feed regime. The limestone feed system control<br>
522 is configured to increase, decrease, or maintain the feed rate of the<br>
conditioned limestone to the pulverized coal direct fired boiler 500 in accordance<br>
with a limestone feed program stored in the limestone feed system control. The<br>
stored limestone feed program is configured based upon empirical data concerning<br>
suitable limestone feed rates.<br>
The operation of the roller mill 512 for grinding limestone is subjected to<br>
certain signals received by the limestone feed system control unit 522 from the<br>
various components connected thereto. Thus, for example, in accordance with<br>
one exemplary limestone feed control regime, the limestone feed system control<br>
unit 122, in accordance with the stored limestone feed program, controls the feed<br>
hopper 104 to feed raw untrammeled limestone onto the gravimetric feed device<br>
108 at a predetermined feed rate. The operation of the gravimetric feed device<br>
108 is also controlled by the limestone feed system control unit 122 to effect the<br>
supply of a predetermined volume (by weight) of raw untrammeled limestone to<br>
the roller mill 512. The roller mill 512 then performs a size reduction operation<br>
on the limestone supplied thereto while the limestone feed system control unit 122<br>
controls the operation of the classifier 514 to ensure that the limestone particles<br>
exiting the roller mill 512 onto the pneumatic transport assembly 518 conform to<br>
the desired particle size distribution. The thus supplied limestone particles are<br>
then transported by the pneumatic transport assembly 518 to the pulverized coal<br>
direct fired boiler 500. In connection with outputs from the stored limestone feed<br>
program, the limestone feed system control unit 522 controls the system to reduce<br>
or cease the supply of prepared limestone.<br>
While an embodiment and variations of the present invention have been<br>
shown, it will be appreciated that modifications thereof, some of which have been<br>
alluded to hereinabove, may still be readily made thereto by those skilled in the<br>
