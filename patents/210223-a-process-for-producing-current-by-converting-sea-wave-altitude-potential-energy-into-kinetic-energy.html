T\K following specification particularly describes the nature and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
The invention pertains to the field of producing electric power, more particularly by converting the sea wave altitude potential energy into kinetic energy, then kinetic energy converted into electrical<br>
energy.<br>
The main object of this invention is to produce electric power from the sea wave for use in harbors and also use in seashore belts and etc.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A process to produce electric power by converting Sea wave altitude potential energy into kinetic energy, then kinetic energy converted into electrical energy.<br>
The basic principle can be easily understood as follows.<br>
When water is stored in a place, either a dam or pool the bottom of the water has more energy than the surface.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF FIG.NO.l.<br>
I DENTIFICATION OF ENERGY IN STILL WATER<br>
An aired ball is tied at one end of the rope and the other end is fixed at the bottom of an empty lake as Fig. 1. Now the lake is filled with water up to the height of the rope which is already fixed in the lake. The aired ball is at the surface of the water. In order to increase the water level of the lake, water is continuously let into the lake. At one point the aired ball at the one end of the fixed rope gets immersed. At this point the aired ball tried to move up, but it could not since it is fixed by a fixed rope. Now, the ball has a potential energy.<br>
The quantum of such potential energy depends upon the volume of air/ball, pressure of air, depth from water surface, density, difference between water and air. So, we arrive at the<br>
equation.<br>
Potential energy oC VPD (d,-d2)<br>
V	=	Volume of air<br>
P	=	Pressure of air<br>
D	=	depth from water surface<br>
dj	=	density of water<br>
dj	=	density of air<br>
K	=	constant<br>
Potential energy = KVPD<br><br>
In the experiment (dj-d^) is negligible because throughout the experiment the the^bjek^air in waier medium is not changed. So this value is negligible.<br>
If we change the object gas in medium liquid, the density difference is necessary for example.<br>
Air in water medium, the value of (dj-d^)	=     x,<br>
Hydrogen gas in water the value of (dj-d)	=     x^<br>
Vacuum in water medium the value of (d^-d)      =     X3<br>
X<x3></x3>
SCALE OF ENERGY<br>
1.	First potential energy is the energy required to a particular volume of gas of spherical shape at one atmosphere pressure, drawn towards down from top of liquid surface to one diameter of spherical shape of gas.<br>
2.	Similarly 2nd potential energy is the energy required to draw towards down the spherical shape of the gas in the water up to two diameter depth in water.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF FIG. NO. 2<br>
VARIOUS ENERGY STATE<br>
A ball is tied at one end of the rope and the other end is fixed at the bottom of the water pool setup as shown in Fig.2.<br>
Diameter of ball is 15 cm, height of water in water pool is 90 cm, length of the rope is 100 cm.<br>
l.We increase the water through inlet of pool, Up to height 100cm now the ball is floating on the top of water surface, the rope is vertically straight line. The point "B" is on the water surface, this position is called ground state.<br>
At the ground state<br>
Depth	=	0<br>
Potential energy state (PE^)	=	0<br>
Potential energy        (e^)	=	0<br><br>
2.We then increase the water level by height up to 115 cm in the pool, now the ball immersed in the water, the position of the ball is in excited state. Top of ball point "C" is placed on the top of the water surface. Bottom of the ball point *'B'* is placed one diameter depth from water surface.<br>
At the excited state<br>
Depth	=	15 cm<br>
Potential energy state (PEj)	=	1 st<br>
Potential energy state (e,)	=	(PEJ)-(PEQ)<br>
Similarly water level is increased up to 130 cm in the tube, the position of the ball is at excited<br>
state. Consider point "B" is placed two diameter depth.<br>
At this excited state<br>
Depth	=      30 cm<br>
Potential energy state (PE^)	=      2 nd<br>
Potential energy (e2)	=      (PE2)-(PEo)<br>
Similarly 3 rd potential energy(e)        =     (PE) - (PE)<br>
e^<e></e>
The rate of change, of potential energy is not even.<br>
e,-e,#e2-e,# e3-e2#e,-e3<br>
2,     IDENTIFICATION OF SEA WAVE POTENTIAL ENERGY:-<br>
In sea wave the large quantity of sea water is lifted up against gravitation. In other wards a heavey mass is lifted up against gravitation. The lifted sea water is alive a few second of time, and moving towards sea shore. The lifted sea water possess more energy. This energy may called as sea wave potential energy.<br>
So the sea wave averagly fifty meter length and one meter hight alive fifteen seconds of time. Total potential energy of the sea wave is depend upto length and hight of lifted water or raised water. We can converted the major portion of that total potential energy of the sea wave. The process are the sea wave potential energy is converted to kinetic energy or rotate the main axle. Then the kinetic<br>
energy converted to electrical energy.<br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF FIG. N0.3<br>
&gt;<br>
3.     CONVERSION OF ENERGY IN LAB EXPERIMENT<br>
The apparatus are minimum weight, chain, free wheel, main axle, dynamo, rope, wheel and ball are setup in a water tank as shown in fig.no.3.<br>
The^water pumping device pumped in through the inlet and after some time the same quantity of water is pumped out through the out let. So when pumping device work the water surfer is oscillated vertically, from L^ to L^. (Other wise the whole apparatus are setup on pool connected with water wave producing machine.)<br>
The free wheel is not allow to rotate temporarily, that is ball is fixed position. Now the pump device is working, water level is increased from point L^ to L^, the ball immerced in water, Now the ball has potential energy. The free wheel is allow to rotate, the ball is moving towards upward direction. So the ball travels high potential energy state to low potential energy state, the decreased potential energy is converted to kinetic energy, the kinetic energy is converted to electric energy.<br>
POSITION - 1<br>
The water level is at point L,, the ball is floated on the water surface. This position is ground state. The potential energy is zero.<br>
POSITION - 2<br>
The water level is at point L^the ball is immersed in water a few second of time, and the ball is at excited state, the ball automatically move upward direction to maintain ground state, or to maintain in low energy state. When the ball moves upward direction, the corresponding rop, chain are moved towards the ball side, so the chain connected free wheel and main axle are rotated<br>
POSITION - 3<br>
The next stage, water level is at point L,, the ball is floated on the water surface, the ball moves downward direction, the rop, chain are moved reverse direction, free wheel rotated reverse direction without disturbing rotation of main axle.<br>
The ball is ground state on poison -1 and Position.3 The ball is excited state on position-2. The ball at position-2, the main axle is accelarate to rotate. The pump device is working continuous the position 1 and position - 2 occure altematively, for every posotion2 the main axle is accelarated to continuous rotation. So the attached dynamo main axle is continuous rotation, the electric power is generated by the dynamo.<br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF FIG.N04<br>
4. SYSTEM ESTABLISHED FOR CONVERSION OF WAVE ALTITUDE POTENTIAL ENERGY<br>
We setup the apparatus for the project system as per picture. Refer Fig,4 Position -1<br>
The ball is floated on the sea surface, there is no wave come across the ball, this position is ground state. Depth from sea surface = 0 so potential energy = 0<br>
Position -2<br>
The wave comes across the ball. The ball is immersed into the sea wave for a few seconds of time and the ball is at excited state. So the ball has high potential energy. The ball automatically move upward direction to maintain ground state to maintain low energy state. When the ball moves upward direction along with the rope and chain, the freewheel and axle rotated. So this position the main axle is accelarated to rotation.<br>
Position -3<br>
After the passing of sea wave, the ball comes down to retain the ground state. The minimum weight pull down the rope and chain move reverse direction to set the normal position. The freewheel rotate in reverse direction, without disturbing rotation of main axle. Now the ball is ready to move to that excited state, when the sea wave comes across it. The ball is at the ground state on position -1 and 3. The ball is at excited state on position -2. Natural sea wave is in continuous process, for 24 hours.<br>
So position -1 and position-2 are available naturally for 24 hours. For every position-2 the axle is accellarated continuous rotation so the attached dynamo main axle is rotated continuously, the electric power is generated by the dynamo. Many number of ball and respected free wheel is fitted on main axle for get more electric power.<br><br>
5. ARRIVING STANDARD FORMULAE<br>
In position 2 the ball has potential energy<br>
potential energy	VPD<br>
Potential energy        =      KVPD<br>
K value is taken as one.<br>
Total potential energy of wave is more. We can able to converte a portion of that potential eneray so<br>
we would arrive.<br>
Convertable potential energy	=     VPD<br>
The eneray to rotate the        -s<br>
dynamo main axle	J	=      nVPD<br>
n is number of ball attempt in the sea wave.<br>
Electric power<br>
Generate by Dynamo	=      nVPD<br>
6 DESIGNING PARAMETER TO UTILIZE THE FULL ENERGY OF SEA WAVE<br>
1.	The ball is replaced by plastic cylinder / cylindrical drum.<br>
2.	The air is replaced by Vacuum.<br>
3.	The cylinder flotation position is horizontal or vertical.<br>
