SURFACE TREATED CARBON BLACK HAVING IMPROVED DISPERSABILITY IN RUBBER<br>
This invention relates to the preparation of a surface treated carbon black and the compounds derived therefrom. The invention relates to the preparation of a surface treated carbon black which has inherently improved dispersability characteristics and provides rubber compounds with improved dynamic mechanical properties.<br>
Improvements in manufacturing of carbon black have allowed for the production of very high surface area carbon black suitable to provide high reinforcement and high levels of wear resistance. With the reduction In the particle size and carbon black structure (the degree of branched connectivity of the carbon black), carbon black becomes increasingly difficult to disperse.<br>
Another phenomenon, carbon black networking, also known as the Payne effect, becomes increasingly prevalent as carbon black content in a rubber compound increases, especially as the particle size decreases and structure increases. This carbon black networking effect is manifested by a dramatic drop in modulus as a function of strain in the rubber compound. This drop In modulus is attributed to a disription in the carbon black network and is a non-elastic phenomenon. That is to say that the energy required to disrupt this carbon black network is consumed in the disruption of the carbon black aggregate-aggregate interaction and is not recoverable as elastic energy.<br>
The loss in energy due to the Payne effect results in compounds with inherently<br>
high loss module and. consequently, quite hysteretic. This hysteresis contributes<br>
to  rolling  resistance  in  pneumatic tire  tread  compounds  increasing  fuel<br>
consumption.<br>
Previous inventions (Japanese Patent No. 5643/1970. No. 24462/1983. and No.<br>
30417/1968) disclose surface treated carbon black which provide lower cohesive<br><br>
energy density between the particles. However, these materials are not effective in high surface area carbon black. Other patents (US 4,557,306) teach that carbon black modified with furazan oxides and furazan ring containing compounds provide for improvements in rubber to filler interaction but do not contribute to improvements in the dispersability of the carbon black. And finally, US 4,764,547, teaches that compounds with lower viscosity (thus improved processability) and improved reinforcement properties can be achieved through the use of high surface area carbon black treated with certain amine compounds or quinoline compounds.<br>
Other carbon black coupling agents are known in the art. See, for example T. Yamaguchi et al. In Kautschuk Gummi Kunststoffe, Vol. 42, No. 5, 1989, pages 403-409. which describes a coagent called SumifineÂ® (i.e. N.N-bis(2-methyl-2-nitropropyI)-1,6-diaminohexane). and L. Gonzalez et al. in Rubber Chemistry and Technoloqv. Vol. 69, 1996, pages 266-272. These agents are not used In common practice,<br>
US 4.764.547 teaches that carbon black treated with conventional antidegradants used in the tire industry can afford an improvement in mi)5ing efficiency. These antidegradants are divided into substituted amines such as para-phenyiene diamine and quinoline. Both classes of antidegradants are known as primary antidegradants and function by donating a hydrogen atom to a radical.<br>
The use of an amine compound for carbon surface modification is also disclosed in Japanese abstract J6 2250-073-A.<br>
Carbon black can be difficuit to disperse in polymers when the surface area is high. The rate of dispersion of carbon black in polymers is proportional to the viscosity of the polymer, that is. a high viscosity polymer provides faster rates of carbon black dispersion. In the cases of isoprene based rubbers and natural<br><br>
rubber, long mixing time increases the amount of heat generated in the compound and thus reduces viscosity and thus the rate and extent of carbon black dispersion. One technique to overcome this difficulty is to mix carbon black into the polymer several times in internal mixers for short intervals each time. This provides for less time for heat to be generated in 'the mixer and thus the amount of viscosity reduction is minimized and dispersion is improved, but increasing the number of mixing steps also increases the complexity, time required and expense of the process.<br>
In its primary embodiments, the present invention provides compositions comprising a combination of carbon black and at least one surface treating agent selected from the group consisting of quinone compounds, quinoneimine compounds and quinonediimine compounds.<br>
In its second embodiments, the present invention comprises the methods of combining the surface treating agent with the carbon black.<br>
Third embodiments of the present invention relate to compositions resulting from the addition of the above combination of carbon black and one or more surface treating agents to natural or synthetic polymers.<br>
In its fourth embodiments, the present invention relates to methods of dispersing carbon black in a natural or synthetic polymer composition, to achieve increased dispersibility. improved mixing efficiency and improved processability of the composition, comprising treating the surface of carbon black with at least one surface treating agent selected from the group consisting of quinone compounds, quinoneimine compounds and quinonediimine compounds, or mixtures thereof, and mixing the treated carbon black with the polymer composition.<br>
Other embodiments of the invention encompass details about relative amounts of reactants, surface treating agents, carbon black, rubber compositions and<br><br>
methods of combining carbon black and surface treating agents and dispersing the carbon black into the polymer composition all of which are hereinafter disclosed in the following discussion of each of the facets of the invention.<br>
The invention provides for the preparation of carbon blacks treated with at least one surface treating agent selected from a class of quinone. quinoneimine or quinonediimine compounds. This treated carbon black shows dramatic improvements in dispersability (as measured by both rate of dispersion and extent of dispersion), improved mixing efficiency and improved processability over carbon black not treated with the surface treating agent. The treated carbon black: enhances the formation of bound rubber in compositions such as natural or synthetic elastomers, plastics or blends thereof and, in particular, butadiene-based rubber, providing improved reinforcement characteristics. The vulcanizates prepared therefrom exhibit improved dynamic mechanical properties as compared to vulcanizates prepared with carbon black not treated with the surface treating agent.<br>
Increasing the surface area of carbon blacks leads to improved treadwear, while decreasing the structure improves tear resistance and fatigue crack growth resistance. However, increasing surface area and/or decreasing structure in carbon blacks makes mixing to adequate levels of dispersion even more difficult A number of additives such as processing oils, amine antidegradants and furazans can increase the rate of filler incorporation, enhance processability or improve polymer to filler interactions, but do not provide all three of those desireable properties.<br>
High shear and/or long mixing cycles are required to obtain optimum dispersion of fillers such as carbon blacks in rubber compounds. For example, adequate dispersion of N121 carbon black in natural rubber (NR)'t&gt;^ically cannot be achieved in a  single  pass. Therefore, to obtain  acceptable carbon black<br><br>
dispersion, most rubber compounds are mixed using two or more mixing passes. This increases the cost of the compound as well as limiting mixing capacity.<br>
This invention focuses on the use of a quinone. quinoneimine or quinoned.imine antidegradant as a surface treating agent for carbon black. Thesis surface treated carbon blacks exhibit improved mixing characteristics and improved processability, including substantial improvements In dispersability. Improved processability results from the viscosity reduction in natural rubber resulting from use of the treated carbon black. Viscosity reduction is due to peptization, i.e., chain-scission, which results in a decrease in molecular weight. In addition to improved dispersion, this class of chemicals also imparts improvements in bound rubber in natural and synthetic elastomers.<br>
We have found that surface treating carbon black with a quinone, quinoneimine, -or quinonediimine results in a product that disperses faster in a synthetic and natural rubber tread compound. It is intended that a very broad class of quinones, quinoneimines, or quinonediimines as dispersion agents are suitable for use In the invention, limited primarily by considerations of practicality of physical properties of the agents or the chemical activity of or steric hindrance caused by various substituted groups on the molecules of the dispersion agents. Preferably, the surface treating agent is a quinoneimine or quinonediimine. more preferably a quinonediimine. With regard to all of the above surface treating agents, the para isomer is prefenred.<br>

The most preferred surface treating agent is N-phenyl-N'-l. 3-dimethylbutyl-p-quinonediimine.<br>
Carbon black suitable for use in the invention has a prefenred surface area of from, about 9 to about 420 m2/g. and most preferred from about 40 to about 140 m2/g, as measured by the nitrogen adsorption method (ASTM D 4820). The carbon black may be agglomerated in the form of beads or powder. The carbon black types have a prefen-ed particle size of from about 8 to'about 300 nm average particle size and most preferably from about 12 to about 100 nm.<br>
The surface of the carbon black is preferably treated with from about 0.01 to about 150.0 parts by weight, most preferably from about 0.5 to about 8.0 parts by weight, of the surface treating agent per 100 parts by weight of carbon black.<br>
The surface treating agents may be combined with carbon black beads or powder by spraying the beads or powder with the surface treating agents at a temperature of from above the melting point of the surface treating agent to a temperature below its decomposition temperature. The combination may also be effected by dissolving the surface treating agent in an appropriate solvent and applying the resulting solution to the beads or powder followed by removal of the solvent to produce the surfece treated carbon black. Appropriate solvents include but are not limited to a hexane, THF, toluene, benzene and methanol.<br>
For best results, the surface treating agents should be added to the carbon black at any point from the production site of the carbon black to prior to the mixing of<br><br>
the carbon black and surface treating agent combination with the polymeric material . Such treatment may occur at the entrance of the mixing device in which the carbon black and polymeric material are mixed.<br>
Without intending to be limited to any particular theory, we believe that the surface treated carbon black of our invention works in a very special way in polymer compositions that accounts for their superior effectiveness. There is some evidence indicating the surface treating agents are bound Into the polymer structure of the rubber rather than just acting as a wetting agent which is the case with the antidegradants of US Patent No. 4.764,547.<br>
To explain further, our carbon black surface treating agents contain a non-nucleophiiic nitrogen and is an electron acceptor. As mentioned above, this Is distinguished from the antidegradants of US Patent No. 4,764,^47 that contain nucleophilic nitrogen and are electron donors and/or hydrogen atom donors. Our surface treating agents react differently with radicals, i.e. by addition reactions with the radicals, the effect being an active rather than an inert surface treatment. This results not only in dispersion improvement, but also in the modification of the rheological and physical properties of a rubber compound.<br>
The natural or synthetic polymers used in accordance with the Invention may he natural rubber (NR), a synthetic rubber such as isoprene rubber (IR) or a mixture thereof. Such polymers may be natural or synthetic elastomers, plastics, or blends thereof. Preferably, the njbber composition comprises NR. Blends of a polyisoprene rubber with one or more other mbbers such as polybutadiene rubber or butadiene rubber (BR), styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), and a mixture of BR and SBR may also be used.<br>
In this application, the abbreviation "phr" means the number of parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of njbber, R5r example, in the case of a rubber blend, it<br><br>
would be based on 100 parts by weight of total rubber. " PhCB " means the number of parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of carbon black.<br>
A sulfur-vulcanizable rubber composition typically contains carbon black in an amount from about 10 to about 100. preferably about 20 to about 80. more preferably about 40 to about 80 phr. It may also contain silica in an amount of 0 to about 80. preferably 0 to about 60, more preferably 0 to about 50 phr. It may also contain a silane coupling agent for silica. The typical amount of the silane coupling agent employed is between about 5 to about 20% by weight of the silica loading.<br>
Examples<br>
The following examples illustrate the practice and benefits of our invention. Initially the surface treated carbon black product was evaluated using laboratory scale mixing equipment. This was followed by factory scale mixing experiments of NR and SBR tread formulations.<br>
The following surface treated products were prepared by directly spraying quinonediimines (in this case N-phenyl-N'-1,3-dimethylbutyl-p-quinonediimine (Compound A)) onto the surface of carbon black.<br>
For initial laboratory evaluations, a sample consisting of 4,4 PhCB of Compound A was used.<br>
Example 1: Laboratory Evaluation of Surface Treated Carbon Black in NR.<br>
The NR fomiulations used for initial evaluation are given in Table 1.<br><br>
Table 1. NR Tread Formulation for Lab. Evaluation of Surface Treated N-121 Carbon Black<br><br>
The degree of carbon black dispersion found for the first pass mixes are compared in Table 2 below.<br>
Dispersion analysis is cam'ed out in accordance with ASTM D 2663-93 Test Method C, Annual Book of ASTM Standards, Vol., 09.01, Sect. 9, p. 468,1993, and is reported as dispersion index (Dl).<br><br><br>
The data in Table 2 shows that Compound A surface treated carbon black yields an improved dispersion index of 91, the control masterbatch that was mixed with 6-PPD (an amine as taught in the prior art) had a dispersion index of 77. The average height (H) of the peaks (undispersed carbon black) for all the samples was similar (about 2.3 micrometers). However, the frequency of peaks/cm ' (P/cm) was significantly lower for the Compound A surface treated carbon black (27 vs. 51). Hence F2H. which is used to calculate the dispersion index was also lower. The additional benefits observed were reductions in viscosity and modulus. A reduction in viscosity would make natural rubber easier to process, while, a reduction in modulus would permit higher filler loading and hence potential material cost savings.<br>
With further regard to Table 2, "Added in-situ" means that the surface treating agent was added to the masterbatch rather than used to treat the carbon black.<br>
Example 2: Large Scale Evaluation of Surface Treated Black in NR.<br>
This carbon black treated with Compound A was then mixed in an 80 litres intemal mixer (Fan-ell model FT-80C) and compared to a compound prepared<br><br>
with the N-121 not treated with Compound A. The formulations used are given in Table 3 below.<br>
Table 3. NR Tread Fomiulations for Large Scale Evaluation of Surface Treated N-121 Carbon Black<br><br>
Ingredients for the first mix' were mixed with the rotor and wall temperature at 120T, ram pressure at 60 PSI, and fill factor (volume % of the mixer that is filled) of 73%. The batches were mixed to a temperature of 350T as measured by a thermocouple located in the mixer. The batches were sheeted on a two-roil mill and allowed to cool. The average of three mixes each are reported below for the control blagk and the black treated with Compound A.<br><br>
As seen in Table 4 below, mixing times in the second stage are reduced -40-45% when the carbon black is treated with Compound A. Overall, total mixing times are reduced by 18 to 27% (first pass mix time plus second pass mix times).<br>
Table 4<br>
Large Scale Mixing Characteristics of Surface Treated Carbon Black Product (AB)<br><br>
The Tirst mixes' were allowed to relax for at least 4 hours but not more than 48 hours then mixed again. The rotor and wall temperatures were set to 120*F, ram pressure @ 40 PSI, and the fill factor was 69%. The mixes were mixed to a temperature of 210Â° F as measured by a themnocouple located in the mixing chamber.<br>
The above batches were cured in a njbber process analyzer (RPA model 2000) at 150o C for 15 minutes. Dynamic mechanical properties were measured by a strain sweep having a frequency of 100 cycles per second. As expected, slight reductions in G' (elastic component of shear modulus) occurred while greater reductions in G" (viscous component of shear modulus) were observed. I Averaging two mixes prepared as described above gave the reductions in loss tangent as a function of strain as shown in Table 5.<br>

As expected, slight reductions in G' (elastic component of shear modulus) occurred while greater reductions in G" (viscous component of shear modulus) were observed. Averaging two mixes prepared as described above gave the reductions in Loss Tangent (TanD) as a function of strain as shown in the following Table 5:<br><br><br><br>
Loss tangent is proportional to energy loss or hysteresis, Is measured as the ratio of G" (loss modulus, kilo Pascals) to G' (storage modulus, kilo Pascals) and is termed loss tangent or Tan D. Tan D is proportional to rolling resistance and thus fuel efficiency of a tire compound. Compounds with a lower Tan D measured at 60^ C will have lower rolling resistance and thus be more fuel efficient.<br>
Example 3: Laboratory Scale Evaluation of an NR/BR (BR is butadiene rubber) Sidewall Compound.<br>
A sidewall recipe containing NR/BR in a 55/45 parts ratio and 50 phr of N-550 carbon black was mixed on a laboratory scale and evaluated for physical properties and carbon black dispersion. The recipe is shown in table 6 below. The physical properties and dispersion infomation are shown in table 7. The batch mixed using the Compound A treated N-550 exhibited an improvement in carbon black dispersion but not the reduction in viscosity or 100% modulus that was seen with the NR tread recipe.<br><br>
Table 6. NR/BR Sidewall Recipe for Laboratory Evaluation Compound A Treated N550 Carbon Black<br><br><br>
Example 4: Large Scale Evaluation of an SBR (styrene butadiene rubber) Tread Recipe<br>
The SBR recipe mixed and tested is detailed in Table 8 below. The batches were mixed to a first pass drop temperature of 350Â°F using a fill factor of 69%. Rotor speeds were adjusted in order to produce a range of mix quality; i.e., to produce under mixed and over-mixed batches for comparison to properly mixed batches. The second pass mixes were dropped at 210Â°F. Mix cycle time, dispersion index, and Mooney viscosities were compared for each of the second pass mixes shown in Table 9 below. The second pass mix times were found to average -40-50% shorter mixing times for the batches containing the Compound A treated carbon black. This leads to approximately a 20% decrease in the overall mix cycle times (first pass plus second pass times). No difference was found in the dispersion index between the control compounds and the compounds containing the treated carbon black. However, very large differences were found for the Mooney viscosities of the compounds containing the treated carbon black and the control compounds. Unlike the case of the NR tread compound, the Mooney viscosities of the SBR compounds containing surface treated carbon black were significantly increased over those of the corresponding control batches. This indicates either that the Compound A treatment has promoted greater interaction between the polymer and the carbon black or that it has prevented significant breakdown of the polymer during the mixing process. In either case treadwear should be improved versus the control compound.<br><br>
