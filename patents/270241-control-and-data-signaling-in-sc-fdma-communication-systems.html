CONTROL AND DATA SIGNALING IN SC-FDMA COMMUNICATION<br>
SYSTEMS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention is directed, in general, to wireless communication<br>
systems and, more specifically, to multiplexing control and data information in<br>
single-carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) communication<br>
systems.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
In particular, the present invention considers the transmission of positive<br>
or negative acknowledgement bits (ACK or NAK, respectively) and channel<br>
quality indicator (CQI) bits together with data information bits in an SC-FDMA<br>
communications system and is further considered in the development of the 3rd<br>
Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio<br>
Access (E-UTRA) long term evolution (LTE). The invention assumes the uplink<br>
(UL) communication corresponding to the signal transmission from mobile user<br>
equipments (UEs) to a serving base station (Node B). A UE, also commonly<br>
referred to as a terminal or a mobile station, may be fixed or mobile and may be a<br>
wireless device, a cellular phone, a personal computer device, a wireless modem<br>
card, etc. A Node B is generally a fixed station and may also be called a base<br>
transceiver system (BTS), an access point, or some other terminology. The<br>
ACK/NAK bits and CQI bits may also be referred to simply as control<br>
information bits.<br>
The ACK or NAK bits are in response to the correct or incorrect,<br>
respectively, data packet reception in the downlink (DL) of the communication<br>
system, which corresponds to signal transmission from the serving Node B to a<br>
UE. The CQI transmitted from a reference UE is intended to inform the serving<br>
Node B of the channel conditions the UE experiences for signal reception,<br>
enabling the Node B to perform channel-dependent scheduling of DL data<br>
packets. Either or both of the ACK/NAK and CQI may be transmitted by a UE in<br>
the same transmission time interval (TTI) with data or in a separate TTI with no<br><br>
data. The disclosed invention considers the former case, which may also be<br>
referred to as data-associated transmission of the ACK/NAK and/or CQ1.<br>
The UEs are assumed to transmit control and data bits over a TT1<br>
corresponding to a sub-frame. FIG. 1 illustrates a block diagram of the sub-frame<br>
structure 110 assumed in the exemplary embodiment of the disclosed invention.<br>
The sub-frame includes two slots. Each slot 120 further includes seven symbols<br>
and each symbol 130 further includes of a cyclic prefix (CP) for mitigating<br>
interference due to channel propagation effects, as it is known in the art. The<br>
signal transmission in the two slots may be in the same part or it may be at two<br>
different parts of the operating bandwidth. Furthermore, the middle symbol in<br>
each slot carries the transmission of reference signals (RS) 140, also known as<br>
pilot signals, which are used for several purposes including for providing channel<br>
estimation for coherent demodulation of the received signal.<br>
The transmission bandwidth (BW) is assumed to include frequency<br>
resource units, which will be referred to herein as resource blocks (RBs). An<br>
exemplary embodiment assumes that each RB includes 12 sub-carriers and UEs<br>
are allocated a multiple N of consecutive RBs 150. Nevertheless, the above<br>
values are only illustrative and not restrictive to the invention.<br>
An exemplary block diagram of the transmitter functions for SC-FDMA<br>
signaling is illustrated in FIG. 2. Coded CQI bits 205 and coded data bits 210 are<br>
multiplexed 220. If ACK/NAK bits also need to be multiplexed, the exemplary<br>
embodiment assumes that data bits are punctured to accommodate ACK/NAK<br>
bits 230. Alternaitively, CQI bits (if any) may be punctured or different rate<br>
matching, as it is known in the art, may apply to data bits or CQI bits to<br>
accommodate ACK/NAK bits. The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of the<br>
combined data bits and control bits is then obtained 240, the sub-carriers 250<br>
corresponding to the assigned transmission bandwidth are selected 255, the<br>
inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) is performed 260 and finally the cyclic<br>
prefix (CP) 270 and filtering 280 are applied to the transmitted signal 290.<br>
Alternatively, as illustrated in FIG. 3, in order to transmit the control<br>
(ACK/NAK and/or CQI) bits 310, puncturing of coded data bits 320 may apply<br><br>
330 (instead of also applying rate matching as in FIG. 2) and certain coded data<br>
bits (for example, the parity bits in case of turbo coding) may be replaced by<br>
control bits. The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) 340 of the combined bits is<br>
then obtained, the sub-carriers 350 corresponding to the assigned transmission<br>
bandwidth are selected 355 (localized mapping is assumed but distributed<br>
mapping may also be used), the inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) 360 is<br>
performed and finally the cyclic prefix (CP) 370 and filtering 380 are applied to<br>
the transmitted signal 390.<br>
This time division multiplexing (TDM) illustrated in FIG. 2 and FIG. 3<br>
between control (ACK/NAK and/or CQI) bits and data bits prior to the DFT is<br>
necessary to preserve the single carrier property of the transmission. Zero<br>
padding, as it is known in the art, is assumed to be inserted by a reference UE in<br>
sub-carriers used by another UE and in guard sub-carriers (not shown). Moreover,<br>
for brevity, additional transmitter circuitry such as digital-to-analog converter,<br>
analog filters, amplifiers, and transmitter antennas are not illustrated in FIG. 2<br>
and FIG. 3. Similarly, the encoding process for the data bits and the CQI bits, as<br>
well as the modulation process for all transmitted bits, are well known in the art<br>
and are omitted for brevity.<br>
At the receiver, the inverse (complementary) transmitter operations are<br>
performed. This is conceptually illustrated in FIG. 4 where the reverse operations<br>
of those illustrated in FIG. 2 are performed. As it is known in the art (not shown<br>
for brevity), an antenna receives the radio-frequency (RF) analog signal and after<br>
further processing units (such as filters, amplifiers, frequency down-converters,<br>
and analog-to-digital converters) the digital received signal 410 passes through a<br>
time windowing unit 420 and the CP is removed 430. Subsequently, the receiver<br>
unit applies an FFT 440, selects 445 the sub-carriers 450 used by the transmitter,<br>
applies an inverse DFT (IDFT) 460, extracts the ACK/NAK bits and places<br>
respective erasures for the data bits 470, and de-multiplexes 480 the data bits 490<br>
and CQI bits 495. As for the transmitter, well known in the art receiver<br>
functionalities such as channel estimation, demodulation, and decoding are not<br>
shown for brevity and they are not material to the present invention.<br>
The control bits typically require better reception reliability than the data<br><br>
bits. This is primarily because hybrid-automatic-repeat-request (HARQ) usually<br>
applies to data transmission but not to control transmission. Additionally,<br>
ACK/NAK bits typically require better reception reliability that CQI bits as<br>
erroneous reception of ACK/NAK bits has more detrimental consequences to the<br>
overall quality and efficiency of communication than does erroneous reception<br>
for the CQI bits.<br>
The size of resources in a transmission sub-frame required for control<br>
signaling for a given desired reception reliability depend on the channel<br>
conditions the signal transmission from a UE experiences and in particular, on the<br>
signal-to-interference and noise ratio (SINR) of the received signal at the serving<br>
Node B.<br>
There is a need to determine the placement of control bits when<br>
transmitted in the same sub-frame with data bits so that better reception reliability<br>
is provided for the control bits than for the data bits.<br>
There is another need to determine the placement of acknowledgement<br>
bits relative to channel quality indication bits, in case they are simultaneously<br>
multiplexed, in order to provide better reception reliability for the former.<br>
There is another need to dimension the resources required for the<br>
transmission of acknowledgement bits, in a sub-frame also containing data bits, as<br>
a function of the channel conditions experienced by the signal transmission from<br>
a UE.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings. This invention may, however, be<br>
embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the<br>
embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this<br>
disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the<br>
invention to those skilled in the art.<br>
Additionally, although the invention assumes a single-carrier frequency<br>
division multiple access (SC-FDMA) communication system, it also applies to all<br>
FDM systems in general and to OFDMA, OFDM, FDMA, DFT-spread OFDM,<br>
DFT-spread OFDMA, single-carrier OFDMA (SC-OFDMA), and single-carrier<br>
OFDM in particular.<br>
Basically, the system and methods of the embodiments of the present<br>
invention solve problems related to the need for providing the desired reliability<br>
for the reception of control signaling under indicative transmission sub-frame<br>
structures and provide additional advantages such as the reduction of resource<br>
overhead for the transmission of control signals.<br>
A first observation for the sub-frame structure illustrated in FIG. 1 is that<br>
the reference signal (RS) exists only in the middle symbol of each slot. In case of<br>
a mobile terminal, or user equipment (UE), with high speed, this can substantially<br>
degraded channel estimation for symbols located further away from the RS (that<br>
is, for symbols near the beginning and end of each slot) due to the faster variation<br>
of the channel medium as the UE velocity increases. This may be acceptable for<br>
data transmission that is coded, which has typically a relatively large target block<br>
error rate (BLER), such as 10% or above, and can benefit from retransmissions<br>
though a conventional HARQ process. Conversely, the CQI and particularly the<br>
ACK/NAK have much stricter performance requirements, HARQ typically does<br><br>
not apply to the corresponding transmissions, and providing an accurate channel<br>
estimate is essential in achieving the desired reception reliability.<br>
A brief set of simulation results for the un-coded (raw) bit error rate<br>
(BER) is provided to illustrate the impact of inaccurate channel estimation on the<br>
reception quality as a function of the symbol position in the slot and the UE<br>
speed. Table 1 provides the simulation setup under optimistic conditions for the<br>
performance loss due to imperfect channel estimation at symbols further away<br>
from the RS for the following reasons:<br>
•	Transmission bandwidth is 1 RB. This maximizes power per sub-<br>
carrier.<br>
•	Channel frequency selectivity is large and there are 2 uncorrelated<br>
Node B receiver antennas. This maximizes the slope of the un-coded (raw) BER<br>
curve and minimizes the relative performance loss due to imperfect channel<br>
estimation for a target BER value.<br>
•	Operating signal-to-interference and noise ratio (SINR) is large. This<br>
minimizes the impact of inaccurate channel estimation.<br><br><br>
FIG. 5 presents the un-coded BER. At symbol locations symmetric to the<br>
RS, the BER is typically the same. At 120 Kmph and 350 Kmph, the transmission<br>
in the first slot is assumed to occur at a different BW than the one in the second<br>
slot (frequency hopped transmission per slot). As only 1 RS per slot is available<br>
for channel estimation, the BER is the same at symbols symmetric (equidistant) to<br>
the RS. At low speeds, such as 3 Kmph, this is also the case because the channel<br>
does not change over the sub-frame duration. Some small variability does exist<br>
for medium UE speeds, such as 30 Kmph, but, for simplicity, the average BER of<br>
symbols equidistant to the RS is only shown.<br>
Even under the previous optimistic assumptions for the un-coded (raw)<br>
BER degradation due to degraded channel estimation at symbols further away<br>
from the RS, at 350 Kmph the BER saturates at the lst/7th and 2nd/6th symbols.<br>
However, the impact on the BER of the 3rd/5th symbols is rather contained and<br>
saturation is avoided (the difference relative to the BER at 3 Kmph is also partly<br>
due to the fact that the latter uses both RS in the sub-frame for channel estimation<br>
which therefore effectively operates with twice as much SINR). The BER at 120<br>
Kmph is also degraded by about 3 dB for the lst/7th symbols and by about 1.5 dB<br>
for the 2nd/6th symbols relative to the one of the 3rd/5,h symbols at about the 1%<br>
point. Obviously, due to the flattening of the BER curves for the lst/7th and 2nd/6th<br>
symbols, the degradation will be much larger for BER operating points below 1 %<br>
as it is typically needed for the NAK reception.<br>
Based on the results in FIG. 5 it becomes apparent that the control<br>
transmission should be placed with priority immediately next to the RS.<br>
FIG. 6 illustrates such a placement when a UE transmits both ACK/NAK<br>
bits 610 and CQI bits 620 during a sub-frame. These control bits are placed on<br>
symbols next to the RS 630 while the data bits 640 are included in symbols<br>
transmitted over the entire sub-frame (with the obvious exception of the symbols<br>
carrying the RS transmission). Due to the requirement for better reception<br>
reliability, the ACK/NAK bits are placed closer to the RS than the CQI bits.<br>
FIG. 7 illustrates the case in which the UE transmits only ACK/NAK bits<br>
710 together with data bits 720 during a sub-frame. The ACK/NAK bits are<br><br>
placed at the two symbols next to the RS 730 in each of the two sub-frame slots<br>
while the data bits are included in symbols transmitted over the entire sub-frame.<br>
FIG. 8 illustrates the case in which the UE transmits only CQI bits 810<br>
together with data bits 820 during a sub-frame. The CQI bits are placed at the two<br>
symbols next to the RS 830 in each of the two sub-frame slots while the data bits<br>
are included in symbols transmitted over the entire sub-frame.<br>
To minimize channel estimation losses, the ACK/NAK bits should be<br>
placed with priority in the symbol after the first symbol carrying the RS. This<br>
does not impact demodulation latency as a channel estimate is available only after<br>
this first RS symbol. To address low SINR or coverage issues, the ACK/NAK bits<br>
can also be placed in the symbol before the second RS. For medium UE speeds,<br>
this second placement of ACK/NAK bits benefits from improved channel<br>
estimation and time diversity while for high UE speeds, it benefits from<br>
frequency and time diversity. This is illustrated in FIG. 9 where the ACK/NAK<br>
bits 910 are placed in only one symbol next to the RS 920 in each slot, these two<br>
symbols (one in each slot) are located between the two RS, while the data bits<br>
930 are transmitted throughout the sub-frame (with the obvious exception of the<br>
symbols carrying the RS).<br>
Provisioning for the transmission of ACK/NAK bits in the sub-carriers<br>
over 2 symbols is typically adequate to achieve the desired BER for the ACK<br>
reception. Nevertheless, because the NAK reception has typically a lower BER<br>
target, it is appropriate to have the ACK/NAK transmission over the number of<br>
sub-carriers in 1 symbol in each slot. If further ACK/NAK transmissions are<br>
needed, because of low SINR or coverage issues, the other symbols next to the<br>
RS in the 2 slots may also be used as illustrated in FIG. 6 and FIG. 7.<br>
Depending on the number of information bits carried in the CQI reporting,<br>
which are typically several times more than the ACK/NAK information bits, the<br>
symbols immediately adjacent to the RS may not suffice for the CQI transmission,<br>
especially for coverage or SINR limited UEs that are also typically assigned small<br>
bandwidth allocations (a small number of RBs). In such cases, the CQI<br>
transmission may also extend to one or more symbols that are adjacent to the<br>
symbols also carrying CQI information that are adjacent to the symbols carrying<br><br>
the RS. An exemplary embodiment of this principle is illustrated in FIG. 10. As<br>
previously discussed, the location of the ACK/NAK bits 1010 remains in symbols<br>
next to the RS 1030 but the CQI bits 1020 are located in symbols throughout the<br>
transmission sub-frame, similarly to the data symbols 1040.<br>
While the present invention has been shown and described with reference<br>
to certain exemplary embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled<br>
in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended<br>
