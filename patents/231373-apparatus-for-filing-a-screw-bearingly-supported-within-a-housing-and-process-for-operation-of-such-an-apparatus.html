				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to an apparatus for filling a screw bearingly supported<br>
within a housing, in particular of an extruder, for processing of pre-comminuted<br>
synthetic plastic material, wherein The filling opening of a screw housing is in<br>
flow connection with the lower outflow opening of an upright vacuum-tight<br>
receptacle for material to be processed, and wherein within the receptacle tools<br>
are provided which are driven by a drive means for rotation around an, in<br>
particular vertical, axis, which tools act onto the material that is introduced into<br>
the receptacle from above through a sluice. Further, the invention relates to a<br>
process for operation of such an apparatus.<br>
An apparatus of the initially desc ibed kind is known to the applicants from<br>
practice as a vacuum hopper for injection molding or extrusion machines. Such a<br>
construction, however, cannot suivably be used for all kinds of synthetic plastic<br>
material, in particular not for such kinds of plastics which require a longer dwell<br>
time within the receptacle, for example PET (polyethylene terephthalate), for<br>
example comminuted material deriving from bottles, bottle pre-forms, foils or<br>
plates. This material, as a rule, s not pre-crystallized and requires a certain<br>
temperature and homogenous distribution before it is introduced into the screw<br>
housing for plastification.<br>
The dwell time within the receptac e is categorized broadly as under:<br>
Short dwell time : 5 to 30 minutes<br>
Optimum dwell time : 40 to 90 minutes<br>
Longer dwell time : 1-3 hours.<br>
These are accepted categories in the art, for which no experimental results are<br>
available.<br>
The invention has at its object to improve an apparatus of the initially described<br>
kind so that the requirements mentioned above are met, that means, that such<br>
special kinds of plastics, in particular milled PET-material, are so processed within<br>
the receptacle that the material is fed with the desired homogenous condition<br>
into the filling opening of the screw housing. The invention solves this task by<br>
the features that within the receptacle, in the middle region of the height<br>
thereof, at least one tool that quickly rotates for creating a mixing cone, is<br>
disposed between an upper inte rior portion and a lower interior portion of the<br>
receptacle, wherein within the upper interior portion the processed plastic<br>
material, in particular PET, circulates in form of a mixing cone with introduction<br>
of power, whereas the lower interior portion constitutes a dwell space for the<br>
heated plastic material that has reached it, for thermal homogenization of the<br>
material, and wherein tools circulating within this dwell space are formed as<br>
mere mixing tools without substantial power introduction in order to avoid<br>
agglomeration of the plastic material. Within this, the invention starts from the<br>
finding that it is difficult to feed the screw with material processed within the<br>
receptacle and having a uniform dwell time through the lower outflow opening of<br>
the receptacle. Tests have shown that this difficulty can be overcome by the fact<br>
that within the upper region of the receptacle the power necessary for obtaining<br>
the desired temperature range of the material can be relatively quickly obtained<br>
by the tool circulating within this region. The power that can be introduced by<br>
the circulating tools is within the<br>
lower region of the receptacle smaller, because there processing is less intensive, what<br>
contributes to avoid overheating c f the material, although the processed material remains<br>
within the lower inner part of thte receptacle mostly for a considerable dwell time. This<br>
dwell time ensures a good the mal homogeneity of the material entering the screw<br>
housing and, therefore, a good quality of the material that is conveyed by the screw to a<br>
further processing, for example an extruder. The longer the average dwell time of the<br>
material within the receptacle is, he less is the likelihood that a plastic particle that is not<br>
sufficiently pre-heated or, respectively, dried or, respectively, pre-crystallized, enters the<br>
screw housing, what is not desired. The minor action of the tools disposed within the lower<br>
receptacle section contributes also to supply the stirred material without any difficulty, in<br>
particular without clustering by agglomeration, to the filling opening of the screw housing<br>
which suitably is immediately connected to the outflow end of the receptacle, in special<br>
cases, however, can also be connected therewith via a connecting tube. The evacuability<br>
of the receptacle ensures a better drying of an eventual wet material and shields the pre-<br>
heated material, in particular PE, against the air oxygen, so that this material can be pre-<br>
crystallized in the desired manner and a high pre-crystallization value can be obtained. In<br>
the described manner, also wet plastic material (humidity up to about 5%) can be<br>
processed, because within the upper inner space portion of the receptacle the higher<br>
additional power required for drying can be introduced without any problem, without that<br>
there is the danger of a non-horr ogenous treatment of the synthetic plastic material.<br>
According to a further enbodiment of the invention, the tool circulating within the<br>
central region of the receptacle is positioned on the upper side of a disc, the edge thereof<br>
being spaced a small distance from the inner wall of the receptacle. Within the spirit of the<br>
invention, this distance amounts, to at least 20 mm. By this distance, an annular-shaped<br>
penetration opening around the edge of the disc is provided for the plastic material<br>
processed within the upper inner space portion of the receptacle, through which this<br>
material by and by reaches the lower inner space portion of receptacle from the upper<br>
inner space portion. The most favorable distance for forming this annular gap depends<br>
from the kind of the processed plastics material and also from the degree of comminuting<br>
it. The greater the density of the processed material is, the smaller can be the size of the<br>
said annular gap. In order to enable an adaptation to different conditions, it is suitable<br>
within the spirit of the invention, if the size of the distance can be adjusted, and this can be<br>
designed by a suitable adjustment of marginal sections of the disc without any problem.<br>
The introduction of the processed material disposed within the receptacle into the<br>
intake opening of the screw housing is facilitated if the receptacle has an upper cylindrical<br>
section and a lower conical section which tapers towards the filling opening of the screw<br>
housing. Such a construction has also the advantage that the tools disposed within the<br>
conical section of the receptacle ge t shorter and shorter from above to below, so that,<br>
when a sufficient stirring action is maintained, the power introduction into the treated<br>
material becomes neglectibly small. Within that, it is of advantage when within the spirit of<br>
the invention the tool creating the mixing cone is disposed in the region of the upper end<br>
of the conical section, because this favors forming the mixing cone by the inclined wall<br>
sections.<br>
It has been shown that favorable relations between the height of the cylindrical<br>
section and the height of the conica section are in the range of between 3:1 and 1:3.<br>
As already mentioned, the tools disposed within the lower inner space section of<br>
the receptacle are mere mixing tools. This may hold also for the tools creating the mixing<br>
cone in the upper inner space portion of the receptacle, because comminuting of the<br>
plastic material that is mostly ntroduced in a pre-comminuted condition into the<br>
receptacle, as a rule, is not necessary. If desired, however, a tool disposed in the upper<br>
section of the receptacle can be formed as a comminuting tool, preferably it can be<br>
provided with cutting edges, in particular if such comminuting tools are carried by the disc<br>
separating the two inner space sections of the receptacle.<br>
For constructional reasons, it is favorable to close the vacuum-tight receptacle up<br>
by a cover which has an opening for introduction of the material, to which a chamber is<br>
connected that can be closed up and below by vacuum-tight closeable valves, in particular<br>
gates, and to which an evacuating line is connected, wherein an additional evacuating line<br>
is connected to the receptacle. T lis chamber acts as evacuable sluice for the material to<br>
be introduced into the receptacle, so that no air oxygen reaches the receptacle when<br>
filling it. The cover can be used for carrying the drive means, in particular a controllable<br>
drive means, and, if desired, also a gear means, for the tools. Such a drive means<br>
enables one to change the speed of rotation of the tools and to adapt thereby to the<br>
respective present circumstances. A finer adjustment of desired operation conditions<br>
within the receptacle is obtained according to a further embodiment of the invention by the<br>
features that the tools positioned within the lower section of the receptacle and the tools<br>
positioned within the upper suction of the receptacle are driven via coaxial shafts<br>
independently from each other. Thereby, the object aimed at can be met in a particular<br>
favorable manner, namely to int oduce the power in the upper section of the receptacle as<br>
quick as possible into the material positioned there, for example by tools quickly rotating<br>
there. However, in the lower receptacle section it is intended to thermally homogenize the,<br>
material, in order to keep the desired exit temperature at the outflow opening of the funnel'<br>
and for this a comparatively lower circulation of the tools may be sufficient.<br>
It is suitable for obtaining the desired effect, to provide according to the invention in<br>
the upper and in the lower section of the receptacle at least one temperature sensor each<br>
and to control the operation process in dependence from the temperature<br>
conditions detected by these temperature sensors. In order to avoid losses to the<br>
outside, the receptacle has heat-hsulating walls. A further possibility to influence<br>
the temperature conditions within the receptacle consists in that the receptacle<br>
has at least one double-walled casing section, the hollow space of which is<br>
connected to a line for a temperature control medium which can be a liquid or a<br>
gas. Thereby, for example, heating of the material positioned within the upper<br>
receptacle section can be accelerated by applying additional heat power via the<br>
temperature control medium anc/or a cooling of the material positioned within<br>
the lower receptacle section can be obtained via the temperature control<br>
medium.<br>
It has been shown that particular favourable operating conditions can be<br>
obtained if the effective volume of the receptacle corresponds at least to the half<br>
throughput per hour of the screw, preferably to the single to triple throughput.<br>
For this, it is suitable if the entire tools introduce into the processed plastics<br>
material a mixing energy of 3 to 12 kWh per 100 kg throughput of the extruder<br>
screw. This is sufficient also for processing wet synthetic plastic material. The by<br>
far predominant portion of this mixing energy is introduced by the tools relating<br>
to the upper interior portion of the receptacle.<br>
The inventive process for operating an inventive apparatus is characterized in<br>
that the energy introduced into the material contained within the receptacle is<br>
controlled by controlling the rotational speed of at least one shaft carrying the<br>
tools. Thereby optimal results can be obtained. This control of the rotational<br>
speed of the tools is suitably made independent from the temperatures of the<br>
processed material measured in the lower and upper section of the receptacle. If<br>
desired, an additional tempering of the processed plastic material can be<br>
obtained by introduction of a tempering medium into at least one of the tools.<br>
Alternatively, or in addition thereto, tempering of the material contained within<br>
the receptacle can be performed by supplying a tempering medium into the<br>
hollow space of least one double-walled section of the casing of the receptacle.<br>

line VII-VII of Fig. 7. Fig. 9 shows n a section similar to Fig. 6 and 7 a further<br>
variant and Fig. 10 is a section taken along the line X-X of Fig. 9.<br>
Within the embodiment according to Fig. 1 and 2, the apparatus comprises a<br>
stationary receptacle 1 for the synthetic plastic material to be processed which,<br>
in<br>
particular, is pre-comminuted PET-material, that is therefore in a pourable condition. As a<br>
rule, this material derives from commnuted, in particular milled, bottles, bottle pre-forms,<br>
foils or plates of PET. The upright receptacle 1 has a vertical axis 62 and a substantially<br>
cylindrical upper section 2 to which a f usto-conical section 3 is below connected. The two<br>
sections 2, 3 confine an upper interior portion 68 and a lower interior portion 69 of the<br>
receptacle 1. The entire receptacle 1 has a great volume so that great volumes of material<br>
can be processed so that all materia portions of the material to be processed remain<br>
within the receptacle 1 for a certain, sufficient long dwell time to be sufficiently pre-<br>
conditioned before the respective materia) enters from the lower outflow opening 4 of the<br>
receptacle 1 into a vacuum-tight filling opening 5 of the housing 6 of a screw 7. For<br>
example, the volume of the receptacle is so dimensioned that the material contained<br>
therein reaches an average processing time in the container 1 for about one hour. The<br>
housing 6 together with the screw 7 forms mostly an extruder, it can be a single screw<br>
extruder or a multiple screw extruder. Within the housing 6, the material supplied through<br>
the filling opening 5 to the screw 7 is plasticized by the screw and is extruded in a known<br>
manner through an extruder head 8 in fc rrn of ropes. A granulating apparatus (not shown)<br>
or another shape-producing tool can be connected to the extruder head 8. However, the<br>
screw 7 can also be a mere conveying screw or, respectively, dosing screw which feds<br>
the material conveyed by it to any desired processing apparatus, for example to an<br>
extruder. The filling opening 5 is suitably vacuum-tightly connected directly to the<br>
discharge opening 4, only in special cases an indirect connection can be made, for<br>
example by means of a vacuum-tight tube piece.<br>
The screw 7 is driven in direction of the arrow 9 by a drive means (not shown) via<br>
a shaft 10 which intersects a vacuum-tight front-side closure 11 of the housing 6 and is<br>
connected for common rotation to the core 12 of the screw 7. As it is shown, this core 12<br>
can have different diameters over the axial length of the screw 7. In the embodiment<br>
shown, the core diameter increases towards two relief zones 13,14 each, in front of which<br>
the conveyed material is in each case compressed and plasticized and is then subjected<br>
to pressure decrease in the relief zones 13 or 14, respectively. By this pressure decrease,<br>
the gas bubbles contained within the material conveyed by the screw 7 can release and<br>
can escape through de-gassing openings 15 or 16, respectively, from the housing 6 in<br>
direction of the arrows 17. Suitably, these gases are collected and, if desired, supplied to<br>
re-utilization. Adjacent the second relie zone 14 the diameter of the screw core 12<br>
increases again, so that the material conveyed by the screw 7 reaches the extruder head<br>
8 or, respectively, the exit nozzles disposed therein in a sufficiently plasticized condition.<br>
The material to be processed is supplied to the receptacle 1 through a chamber 18<br>
(Fig. 2) of an evacuable sluice 60 which is vacuum-tightly constructed and, for this, is<br>
provided up and down with valves 19 or 20, respectively. Suitably, these valves 19, 20 are<br>
constructed as gate valves, the ga e plates 21 or 22, respectively, intersect vacuum-tightly<br>
the walls of the chamber 18 and c an be moved reciprocably by means of hydraulically or<br>
pneumatically actuated cylinders 28, 24. To the upper filling opening 25 of the chamber 18<br>
there is connected the outflow end of a hopper 26 via which the material to be processed<br>
is introduced into the apparatus .The lower outflow end of the chamber 18 is vacuum-<br>
tightly connected to an opening 2' of a cover 28 by which the receptacle 1 is vacuum-<br>
tightly closed to above. To this cover28 an evacuating line 29 is connected, by which the<br>
interior of the receptacle 1 can be evacuated. By means of a further evacuating line 61 the<br>
sluice 60 is evacuable.<br>
Within the receptacle 1 tools 30, 31 constituted by radial wings revolve around the<br>
vertical container axis 62. These tools 30, 31 are fixed to a vertical shaft 32 that is coaxial<br>
to the container axis 62 and may extend outwardly from this shaft in a substantially<br>
horizontal direction. The shaft 32 is vacuum-tightly bearingly supported for rotation in the<br>
cover 28 at the place 33 and is drive n for rotation by a controllable motor 34, if desired via<br>
a gear-means 35. The control lines therefore are marked with 36. The tools 30 are<br>
disposed in the region of that level of the receptacle 1 in which the funnel-shaped lower<br>
section 3 merges into the cylindrical upper section 2. These tools 30 extend close to the<br>
wall of the section 2 of the receptacle 1 and, therefore, cause by their high peripheral<br>
velocity an intensive stirring of the rraterial introduced into the receptacle 1. If necessary,<br>
these tools 30 may be provided with cutting edges 70 so that the processed material is<br>
also comminuted. At this processing the material contained within the upper interior<br>
portion 68 of the receptacle 1 is crculated in form of a mixing cone 71. The power<br>
required for this passes for its major part as heat energy into the so treated material and<br>
heats it thereby. As it can be seen, the tools 31 disposed within the lower interior portion<br>
69 of the receptacle 1 are shorter than the tools 30 disposed within the cylindrical upper<br>
section 2 of the receptacle 1. The lower tools 31, therefore, introduce due to their lower<br>
peripheral velocity less energy into the processed plastic material than the upper tools 30.<br>
Therefore, within the upper section 2 of the receptacle 1, a quick energy introduction for<br>
heating the plastic material supplied coldly from above takes place, which material by and<br>
by descends to below and reaches the region of the shorter tools 31, caused by the<br>
material discharge through the outflov/ opening 4 performed by the screw 7. The shorter<br>
tools 31 only stir the plastic material disposed within their region, the lower interior portion<br>
69 of the receptacle 1, therefore, constitutes a dwell space for the processed heated<br>
material in which eventual thermal inhomogeneities are equalized. At the same time, an<br>
agglomeration of the heated plastic material is avoided. Particularly then, when the lower<br>
interior portion 69 of the receptacle 1 is higher than the upper interior portion 68, there<br>
results the intended considerable dwell time of the processed and stirred plastic material<br>
within the interior portion 69. Suitably, the conditions are so chosen that the entire<br>
effective volume of the receptacle 1 corresponds at least to the throughput of the screw 7<br>
for half an hour. The temperatures occurring within the processed plastic material in the<br>
sections 2 and 3 of the receptacle 1 are suitably monitored by temperature sensors 37 or<br>
38, respectively, to which lines are connected leading to a control device (not shown) by<br>
which suitable control signals are em tted to the control lines 36 of the motor 34. The ends<br>
39 of the tools 31 which are shorter and shorter to below, may be chamfered, as this is<br>
shown in Fig. 2, in order to adapt to he funnel shape of the container section 3. Suitably,<br>
the tools 31 are very thin, so that as little as possible energy is introduced into the<br>
material.<br>
If desired, the rods of the upper tools 30 extending outwardly from the shaft 32 can<br>
also be provided with mixing wings ir order to increase the friction action onto the material<br>
contained within the container 1, so that the energy transfer onto the processed material is<br>
enforced.<br>
In order to avoid heat losses :c the outside, the walls of the casing 42 and suitably<br>
also of the cover 28 of the receptacle 1 are heat-insolated. Within the embodiment<br>
according to Fig. 3 and 4, the tools 30 or 31, respectively, disposed within the upper<br>
section 2 and within the lower section 3 of the receptacle 1 can be driven independently<br>
from each other. For this, the tools 31 are fixed to a central shaft 32 and the tools 30 to a<br>
hollow shaft 43 coaxially surrounding this shaft 32. The two shafts 32, 43 are driven via<br>
toothed rings 44 or 45, respectively by two gearings 35, 46, both of them may be driven<br>
by a common motor 34. The two gearings 35, 46 are controllable via control lines (not<br>
shown), suitably independently from the temperatures of the processed material<br>
measured via the temperature sensors 37, 38 (Fig. 1, 2). The motor 34 and the gearings<br>
35, 46 can be carried by the cover 28.<br>
The upper tools 30 are here formed by a disc 72, which carries the cutting<br>
elements 70 on its outer periphery. This disc can rotate in the same direction as the tools<br>
31 positioned within the lower interior portion 69 of the receptacle 1 (arrow 41, Fig. 4). The<br>
two driving shafts 32, 43 however, result also in the possibility to choose different<br>
directions of rotation.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a particular suitable shape of the tools 31 for the lower portion 3 of<br>
the receptacle 1. As it can be seen, the tools 31 are curved and this in direction of their<br>
rotation (arrow 41) in order to convey the processed material from the outer edge towards<br>
the center, this results in a special mixing action.<br>
An additional influence upon the temperature conditions in the two container<br>
sections 2, 3 can be obtained by tempering the material within the respective section 2 or<br>
3, respectively, via hollow spaces 47 of the tools 30 or 31, respectively, to which hollow<br>
spaces 47 supply lines 48 are connected, via which a tempering medium is fed into the<br>
hollow spaces 47. The tempering medium is fed into the supply lines 48 from tempering<br>
medium sources 49 via suitably rotating joins. The tempering medium must not be the<br>
same for all tools 30 and 31, for example, it is possible to additionally heat the disc 72<br>
forming the tools 30 by the temper ng medium, in order to give the material processed by<br>
the disc or, respectively, by the cutting edges 70 as quick as possible the desired<br>
increased temperature, whereas the tools 31 are cooled by another tempering medium or<br>
by a tempering medium having ar other temperature. The temperatures of the tempering<br>
media supplied to the tools 30, 31 can be controlled in a suitable manner.<br>
A further possibility for influencing the temperature of the material positioned within<br>
the receptacle 1 results from tempering the interior of the receptacle 1 by a double-walled<br>
construction of its casing 42. In Fig. 3 this is shown, whereby the hollow space 52<br>
positioned between the two walls 50, 51, of the casing 42 is sub-divided by partition walls<br>
53 into two superimposed sections 54, 55, respectively connected to a line 56 or 81 for<br>
the supply or, respectively, discharge of a tempering medium which may be a gas or a<br>
liquid. The two lines 56 are connected via control means 57 or 58, respectively, to a<br>
source 59 for the tempering medium. If desired, the two control means 57, 58 can be<br>
supplied by different sources for the tempering medium. The control means 57, 58 can<br>
control the amount and/or tempeature of the respective tempering medium, they can be<br>
influenced by the temperature sensors 37, 38 (Fig. 1, 2). As it can be seen, the<br>
temperature conditions within the two sections 2, 3 of the receptacle 1 can be influenced<br>
by choosing the position of the partition wall 53. Therefore, the partition walls 53 can, but<br>
must not, be positioned at the location at which the funnel-shaped section 3 changes into<br>
the upper cylindrical section 2.<br>
Between the edge of the disc 72 and the inner wall 51 of the receptacle 1 there is<br>
an annular gap 73, the width thereof, as a rule, amounts to at least 20 mm, so that the<br>
material circulated within the intenor portion 68 and heated thereby can by and by reach<br>
the lower interior portion 69 of the receptacle 1. In order to avoid that the processed<br>
material penetrates this annular gap 73 too quickly, its width, however, should not be too<br>
large, as a rule, it is smaller than 30 mm. An adaptation to different conditions of the<br>
processed material is possible, if the width of this annular gap 73 can be changed. For<br>
this, the disc 72, or, respectively, the inner wall of the receptacle can be so constructed<br>
that the respective edge sections of the disc 72 or, respectively, the wall are adjustable in<br>
radial direction.<br>
The effective capacity in Kilogram of the processed material of the receptacle 1<br>
having a great volume corresponds at least to the half, suitable to one- to three times the<br>
throughput of the screw 7 per hour in kilogram. The drive means (motor 34) for the upper<br>
tools 30 suitably introduces a mixing energy of 3 to 12 kWh per 100 kg/h throughput of the<br>
screw into the processed materiaI. These operating examples have been shown as<br>
favorable, the nearer conditions of operations however, depend from the specific quality<br>
and the condition of the respective naterial introduced into the receptacle 1.<br>
The shaft 32 (and, respectively, also the hollow shaft 43) must not be positioned<br>
exactly vertical, inclinations are possible, however, there results all the more a<br>
conveyance of the material positior ed within the receptacle 1 to above or, respectively to<br>
below, the more the shaft is inclinec. In the lower interior portion 69, such a conveyance in<br>
vertical direction, as a rule, is not cesired, because there the material should be agitated<br>
only, but should no more substantially heated.<br>
Within the embodiments according to Fig. 1 to 4, the filling of the housing 6 of the<br>
screw 7 takes place in radial direc tion with respect to the axis 63 of the screw 7, with<br>
which radial direction the axis 62 of the receptacle 1 coincides. Just so, the housing 6 of<br>
the screw 7 can be filled on its front side with the material from the receptacle 1. As Fig. 5<br>
shows, however also a tangential connection of the screw housing 6 of the receptacle 1 is<br>
possible so that the axis 62 of the container is spaced apart from the screw axis 63 for a<br>
distance a. This enables one to subdivide the shaft carrying the tools 30, 31 and to drive<br>
the two shaft sections 64, 65 by each one controllable motor 34 or 66, respectively, from<br>
above, respectively, from below. For this, it is suitable to give the lower end of the upper<br>
shaft section 64 the form of a sleeve 67 surrounding the lower shaft section 65, so that the<br>
two shaft sections 64, 65 are centered relative to each other and bearingly supported.<br>
This tangential connection of the screw housing 6 to the receptacle 1 enables one also to<br>
obtain a stuffing filling of the screw housing 6 by tools 31 rotating around the vertical axis<br>
62 and disposed in the area of the lateral outflow opening of the receptacle 1 or,<br>
respectively, of the filling opening 5 of the screw housing 6.<br>
Within this embodiment, the tools 30 are also constituted by cutting edges 70<br>
carried by a disc 72. This disc 72 is disposed something lower than the upper edge of the<br>
funnel-shaped lower container section 3. This favors forming the mixing cone 71, because<br>
the material treated by the cutting edges 70 is thrown off the disc 72 in radial direction and<br>
reaches the inclined portions of the wall of the casing of the container section 3, so that<br>
the impinging material receives a conponent of motion to above.<br>
Within the embodiment acco ding to Fig. 6 the disc 72 carrying the cutting edges<br>
70 is disposed about at the half of the height of the receptacle 1 and substantially below<br>
the line at which the two container sections 2, 3 change into each other. As mentioned,<br>
the tools 31 disposed below the disc 30 agitate the processed material only, however do<br>
not impart it to become a mixing cone, so chat there results an almost flat material level 40<br>
within the interior portion 69.<br>
The lower end of the funnel-shaped container portion 3 merges into the filling opening 5 of an<br>
extruder screw 7, driven via a gearing 74 by a motor 75. A sealing screw threads 76 avoids exit<br>
of the processed material at the drive side end of the screw 7.<br>
As Figs. 7 and 8 show, the receptacle 1 may below merge into the filling opening 79 of a dosing<br>
screw device 77, which, for example, comprises two dosing screws 78, driven by a common<br>
motor 75 and having parallel axes. This dosing screw device conveys the material into a radially<br>
disposed filling opening 5 of an extruder screw 7.<br>
A variant to this is shown in Fig. 9 and 10. Here, the double dosing screw 78 conveys the<br>
material received from the receptacle : into a shaft 80 from which it falls into the extruder screw<br>
7 from above.<br>
By the described embodiments an average dwell time of at least one half of an hour can be<br>
obtained for each pre-comminuted plastic particle introduced into the container 1. This dwell time<br>
is calculated from the entry of the plastic particle into the upper sluice 60 till the exit from the<br>
container 1 through the outflow opening 4.<br>
The lower outflow opening 4 of the container 1 can feed the material also to another plant as this<br>
is shown, for example by means of a conveyor to a silo or to a device for any further processing,<br>
also to a dosing apparatus.<br>
The publication WO 00/64654 is hereby incorporated in the specification by way of reference.<br>
