				<td>Mixing device, coffee machine provided with mixing device and use of mixing<br>
device<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a mixing device that provides a frothy fluid<br>
product. More particularly, the invention relates to a mixing device for mixing,<br>
frothing, and dispensing a beverage, to a coffee machine provided with such a mixing<br>
device and to the use of the mixing device.<br>
More specific, the present invention relates to a mixing device according to the<br>
preamble of claim 1.<br>
A mixing device according to the preamble of claim 1 is known from WO<br>
03/068039 in the name of Societe des Produits Nestle S.A, Switzerland.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Espresso and other coffee and milk drinks are often prepared by mixing a powder<br>
in water. Traditionally, a milk froth is provided to the drink by steam frothing.<br>
Mixing devices are known for speedier preparation of such beverages and other<br>
foods by mixing a powdered food component with a liquid, such as water. These<br>
devices typically feed the powdered component into the water, which is often pumped<br>
tangentially into the mixing chamber to create a whirlpool to mix the powder into the<br>
water. The mixture is then fed to a mixing mechanism - also called a whipping<br>
mechanism -, which is usually a rotating plate. The plate aerates the mixture and<br>
produces a froth. The frothed mixture is usually dispensed into a container for drinking.<br>
US-A-5,927,553, for example, discloses a mixing and dispensing apparatus with<br>
a cruciform frothing blade. Other shapes of frothing blades are also known. For<br>
instance, companies such as Rhea and Zanussi use whippers with an axially short disk<br>
with very steep sloped walls. Other whippers have rotors with independent ramps<br>
extending from a substantially flat plate. The known devices generally have their<br>
greatest efficiency for preparing a small group of products.<br>
EP 1,116,464 of Bravilor discloses a mixing device comprising a motor 14<br>
provided with a driving shaft 15 carrying a rotor 16,17. The rotor consists of a circular<br>
disc 16 provided with ribs 17. The ribs 17 are arranged on a circular end face of the<br>
disc 16 and extend from this end face in axial direction. How the ribs 17 exactly extend<br>
along the circular end face is neither described nor shown in EP 1,116,464. Only one<br>
rib is shown in side view. This rib appears to extend about diagonally over the circular<br>
end face of disc 16. The one rib 17 is at its radial outer ends tapered in the upstream<br>
direction. The product exit conduit 11 of EP 1,116,464 is arranged on the upstream side<br>
of the disc i 6, radially beside the ribs.<br>
WO 03/068039 of Nestle discloses a mixing device according to the preamble of<br>
claim 1. In this mixing device the rotor consists essentially of a tapering, preferably<br>
conically tapering, rotor body which is, on the tapering rotor surface provided with<br>
twisted, relatively small and accurately dimensioned grooves. The rotor housing has a<br>
corresponding tapered inner surface, but is a little larger so that there is a small,<br>
accurately defined gap between the housing and tapered rotor surface. Also at the<br>
downstream side of the rotor there is a small, accurately defined gap between the back<br>
surface of the rotor and the rotor housing. This accurate shape and accurate dimensions<br>
of the rotor and grooves provided in it as well as the accurate dimensions of the gap<br>
provide a very good frothing and aerating, which is highly desirable with instant coffee<br>
and milk drink machines. When the rotational speed of the rotor is sufficiently high the<br>
reliability of this mixing device on long term is also very good. However with<br>
rotational speeds of the rotor below 10,000 revolutions per minute (rpm) there occurs<br>
deposition of un-dissolved or partly dissolved components on the rotor and housing,<br>
which deposition results in clogging of the gaps and grooves. This clogging is in those<br>
kind of devices undesirable. Taking into account that the dimensions of gaps and<br>
grooves must meet very accurate requirements for optimal results, this known mixing<br>
device is relatively expensive in manufacturing and vulnerable for decrease in<br>
performance in case of clogging.<br>
There is thus clearly a need for a mixing device, especially for instant drink<br>
machines, with a very good, if not improved, frothing and aerating effect, which is less,<br>
preferably not, vulnerable for decrease in performance as a consequence of clogging.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide such an improved mixing device.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
This object is according to the invention achieved by providing a mixing<br>
device according to claim 1. Starting from WO 03/068039, i.e. a mixing device for<br>
aerating and frothing a product that comprises a fluid component and at least one<br>
further component, comprising:<br>
â€¢ a rotor having a rotational axis and a surface of revolution defined by the rotor<br>
upon rotation around its rotational axis, the surface of revolution extending from<br>
a firsl axial end to a second axial end, and the first axial end being directed to the<br>
input container and arranged upstream with respect to the second axial end;<br>
â€¢ a motor in driving association with the rotor for rotating the rotor about the<br>
rotational axis; and<br>
â€¢ a product exit conduit disposed downstream of the rotor and configured for<br>
dispensing the aerated and frothed product of the fluid and at least one further<br>
component;<br>
the rotor comprising a downstream part and an upstream part;<br>
this object is achieved<br>
in that the downstream part comprises a rotational body having a first end surface<br>
facing upstream, a second end surface facing downstream and a downstream rotational<br>
surface facing in radial outward direction;<br>
in that the upstream part comprises an upstream rotational surface facing in radial<br>
outward direction, the upstream rotational surface being provided with ribs extending<br>
in axial (A) and/or radial (R) direction, the ribs having radial edges facing in radial<br>
outward direction, chambers being defined between adjacent ribs, the first end face and<br>
the downstream rotational surface,<br>
in that the surface of revolution is defined by the downstream rotational surface and the<br>
radial edges of the ribs.<br>
By providing the chambers there are created spaces in which un-dissolved or<br>
partially dissolved particles can dissolve, which dissolving is considerably promoted by<br>
the ribs which create high turbulences. Also air is easily trapped in those chambers and<br>
beaten by the high turbulences into the liquid, which enhances the frothing effect.<br>
In a preferred mode, the downstream rotational surface is provided with grooves<br>
extending from the first to the second end surface. The higher turbulence caused by the<br>
ribs thus propagates in the grooves and between the rotor and rotor housing. The higher<br>
turbulence thus also counteracts deposition of particles on the rotor and rotor housing<br>
downstream of the ribs and chambers. Preferably, in each said chamber debouches at<br>
least one ot said grooves.<br>
The chambers are relatively large with respect to the grooves. Viewed in axial<br>
direction the passage width (in mm2) of the grooves debouching in one chamber is<br>
smaller than the passage width (in mm2) of this one chamber, also viewed in axial<br>
direction. This (axial) passage width of the grooves (in mm2) debouching in one<br>
chamber will be between 5 and 25 % of the (axial) passage width (in mm2) of said one<br>
chamber. Expressed differently and viewed in tangential direction, the width of each<br>
chamber (in mm) will be larger than the width (in mm) of the grooves debouching in it.<br>
The grooves in the downstream part of the rotor act to keep the rotating motion of<br>
the fluid (induced by the upstream part of the rotor) going.<br>
Further tests with the invention revealed that as a consequence of the new and<br>
inventive rotor design, the requirements with respect to the accuracy of the dimensions<br>
of gaps, grooves and rotor is of much less importance than in the case of the design of<br>
WO 03/068093. On the one hand this provides an easier manufacturing and on the<br>
other hand it reduces the chance on a reduced performance in case some depositing of<br>
particles might take place. In other words the performance of the present mixer is less<br>
susceptible for negative effects due to depositing of particles.<br>
In order to make use of centripetal forces for frothing and aerating, it is<br>
advantageous when the diameter of the surface of revolution at the first axial end is<br>
smaller than the diameter of the surface of revolution at the second axial end.<br>
In order to support transfer of product from the chambers to the grooves<br>
and to the downstream of the rotor, it is advantageous when, with respect to the<br>
rotational axis, the radial edges of the ribs taper, preferably taper conically, in upstream<br>
direction. This creates a turbulence which increases along the ribs in downstream<br>
direction.<br>
In order to support transport of product along the downstream part of the<br>
rotor and to counteract, preferably prevent, there a decrease in the level of turbulence<br>
earlier created, it is according to the invention advantageous when, with respect to the<br>
rotational axis, the downstream rotational surface tapers, preferably tapers conically, in<br>
upstream direction.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention it is advantageous<br>
when the upstream rotational surface is a cylindrical surface. On the one hand this<br>
provides that the passage width of the chambers increases in axially downstream<br>
direction, whilst on the other hand this provides an easier manufacturing.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention it is, with respect to an<br>
easier production of the rotor, advantageous when the ribs extend essentially strictly in<br>
axial direction and/or essentially strictly in radial direction.<br>
In order to promote breakage of larger solid particles upon entering the<br>
chambers of the rotor as well as to enhance turbulence effects, it is according to the<br>
invention advantageous when the ribs have a rounded upstream edge.<br>
According to still a further embodiment of the invention it is advantageous<br>
when the axial length of the upstream part and the axial length of the downstream part<br>
are about the same. The longer the downstream part will be, the more uniform the air<br>
bubbles will become. However, also the longer the upstream part is, the better<br>
ingredient and air are dissolved in the liquid. Taking into account the limited length<br>
available for the rotor, this results in the compromise to make both parts about the same<br>
length.<br>
Concerning features and advantages of the present invention , similar or identical<br>
to the device of WO 03/068039; reference is made to the description of WO 03/068039,<br>
especially but not exclusively to pages 2 and 3 of WO 03/068039.<br>
Brief description of the drawings<br>
Fig. ! is a schematic perspective view of a rotor for the purpose of defining some<br>
terms used in claim 1;<br>
Fig. 2 is a perspective view of a rotor according to the invention;<br>
Fig. 3 is a perspective view of a preferred embodiment of the invention<br>
comprising a rotor according to fig. 2;<br>
Fig. 4 is a cross-sectional view of the embodiment of fig. 3; and<br>
Fig. 5 is an exploded view of the embodiment of fig. 3.<br>
Detailed description of the drawings<br>
Figure 1 explains with a perspective and schematic view some of the terms used<br>
in claim 1. Figure 1 shows a rotor 1, which as an example has the form of a rectangular<br>
plate. This rotor 1 is rotatable around a rotational axis 2. The rotor 1 has a radial outer<br>
edge 3. When one rotates the rotor 1 around its rotational axis 2, the outer edge 3 will<br>
describe a rotational contour 4, which in this example will be cylindrical. This<br>
rotational contour 4 is called "the surface of revolution defined by the rotor upon<br>
rotation around its rotational axis", in short "the surface of revolution". This "surface of<br>
revolution" thus is primarily a notational or hypothetical surface in mathematical sense.<br>
In case the rotor would be for example a cylinder having the rotational axis coinciding<br>
with the cylindrical axis, the cylindrical outer surface of this cylinder would coincide<br>
with its "surface of revolution".<br>
Referring further to figure 1, the surface of revolution 4 extends between a first<br>
axial end 5 and second axial end 6. Assuming the first axial end 5 is facing in an<br>
upstream direction, the first axial end 5 is arranged upstream with respect to the second<br>
axial end, and the rotor can be divided in an upstream part 7 and downstream part 8.<br>
Correspondingly the outer edge 3 is divided in an upstream part 3b and a downstream<br>
part 3 a.<br>
Further in figure 1, arrow A indicates the axial direction (the arrow A points in<br>
the downstream direction), arrow R indicates the radial direction (the arrow points in<br>
the radial outward direction), and arrow T indicates the tangential direction.<br>
Figure 2 shows a rotor according to the invention. The terms as explained in<br>
figure 1 are indicated in figure 2 with the same reference number increased by 100. The<br>
entire rotor is indicated by 101. The reference number 104 has been omitted in order<br>
not to disturb the clearness of figure 2. It will however be clear that, in the case of<br>
figure 2, the surface of revolution is a conical surface defined by the tapering surface<br>
parts 103a and tapering edges 103b.<br>
The rotor 101 comprises a downstream part 108 and an upstream part 107.<br>
The downstream part 108 is a rotational body 109. The rotational body 109 has a<br>
first end surface 110 facing upstream (opposite to arrow A); a second end surface 106<br>
facing downstream (in the direction of arrow A); and a downstream rotational surface<br>
103a. The downstream rotational surface 103a faces in radial outward direction and<br>
extends from the first end surface 110 to the second end surface 106. In this case the<br>
second end surface 106 corresponds to the so called second axial end of the rotor 101.<br>
The upstream part 107 has an upstream rotational surface 112. This upstream<br>
rotational surface 112 faces in radial outward direction (arrow R in fig. 1). The<br>
upstream rotational surface 112 is provided with ribs 113. The ribs 113 extend in radial<br>
direction and in axial direction, i.e. the extension of the ribs has a radial as well as an<br>
axial component. The extension of the ribs thus can also have a tangential component<br>
(direction arrow T) larger than zero. In the shown embodiment the tangential<br>
component of the extension of the ribs is zero so that the ribs 113 extend in strictly<br>
axial and strictly radial direction.<br>
Chambers 114 are defined between adjacent ribs 113, the first end face 110 of the<br>
rotational body 9, and the upstream rotational surface 112. Those chambers 114 are<br>
open in the radial outward direction (arrow R) and in the upstream direction (opposite<br>
to arrow A).<br>
Each chamber 114 is connected via at least one groove 111 with the downstream<br>
side 106 of the rotational body 109. Those grooves 111 are provided in the downstream<br>
rotational surface 103a.<br>
The surface of revolution (not indicated with a reference number, but compare<br>
reference number 4 in figure 1) of the rotor 101 is defined by the downstream rotational<br>
surface 103a and the radial edges 103b of the ribs 113.<br>
In the embodiment of figure 2 the downstream rotational surface 103a and the<br>
radial edges 103b of the ribs 113 both taper with respect to the rotational axis. As in<br>
this embodiment both tapers have a substantially constant taper angle (in case of the<br>
rotational surface 103a this taper angle is also called a surface angle), the surface of<br>
revolution of this rotor 101 is essentially conical. It is however noted that both tapers<br>
can also be different; that the radial edges 103b and/or the rotational surface 103a can<br>
also be non tapered; and that the radial edges 103b and/or the rotational surface 103a<br>
can also have a non-constant taper (i.e. the taper follows a curved line).<br>
In the next following a rotor 101 according to the invention will be discussed in<br>
relation to a mixing device (comprising such a rotor) according to the invention, which<br>
is shown in figure 3-5. With some exceptions, such as the rotor, the embodiment of the<br>
invention as shown in figure 3-5 is identical to the mixing device as described in WO<br>
03/068039. This WO 03/068039 is in this respect fully incorporated by reference.<br>
Although the embodiment of the invention according to figures 3-5 is a preferred<br>
embodiment, it will be clear that scope of this invention is defined by the claims and<br>
not by the preferred embodiment.<br>
Referring to figs. 3 and 4, a preferred embodiment of the invention is a mixing<br>
device 10 that includes an input container 12. The input container 12 comprises a bowl<br>
portion 14 with a tangential inlet 16 for feeding a fluid under pressure. An<br>
automatically controlled valve is preferably provided to control the fluid flow into the<br>
input container 12. The fluid is introduced through the inlet at a speed selected to<br>
produce a swirling flow, preferably substantially a whirlpool effect.<br>
A component to be mixed with the fluid, preferably a powdered food substance,<br>
is fed into powder inlet 18, which preferably includes an opening at the top of the bowl<br>
portion 14. The powder can be fed by hand or automatically by a powder source,<br>
preferably disposed above the device 10. The powder source preferably has a dosing<br>
mechanism, such as a dosing screw, to automatically dose a predetermined amount of<br>
powder into the input container 12. A lip 20 extends around the interior of the powder<br>
inlet 18, protruding into the bowl portion 14 to prevent the swirling fluid from exiting<br>
the input container 12 by the upper side thereof. A suction is applied to orifice 21,<br>
connected to the underside of the lip 20 for extracting any splashed material. The<br>
powder inlet is sufficiently large to receive the powder poured therein and also to<br>
receive a sufficient amount of air for mixing with the fluid and component.<br>
In the embodiment shown, a throat portion 22 of the input container 12 is<br>
disposed below the bowl portion 14. The throat portion 22 preferably has a narrower<br>
diameter than the bowl portion 14 and has a throat opening 24 disposed on a lateral<br>
side, as shown in fig. 2. The throat portion 22 is preferably generally coaxial with the<br>
bowl portion 14 and narrows substantially evenly along the axis of the bowl portion 14.<br>
This improves the fluid flow therein and reduces any trapping of powder. Preferably, a<br>
transition between the bowl portion 14 and the throat portion 22 has an inward bend 25,<br>
followed by a sloped portion 27, which is followed by an outward bend 29, in crosssection.<br>
Referring to figs. 4 and 5, a rotor assembly is in fluid communication with the<br>
input container 14, preferably at the throat opening 24. The rotor assembly includes a<br>
rotor 101, A motor 30 drives rotor shaft 32, which drives the rotor 101 so that the motor<br>
30 drives the rotor at about rotor axis 34 rotational axis 102, also called the rotor axis.<br>
A motor controller is preferably provided to control the operation and speed of the<br>
motor 30.<br>
The preferred rotor 101 has a conical surface of revolution 104. The conical<br>
surface of revolution 104 preferably faces outwardly with respect to the rotor axis 102<br>
and can have a substantially straight cross-section, as in the embodiment shown, or can<br>
be curved in cross-section with a taper angle that varies along the axial length of the<br>
rotor 101. The surface of revolution in the embodiment shown extends at a surface<br>
angle 42 to the rotor axis 102. Surface angle 42 is the average angle between first and<br>
second axial end 105, 106, and the surface of revolution 104 is preferably substantially<br>
continuous about its circumference between the axial ends 105, 106. The angle may<br>
change beyond the axial ends 105, 106. Surface angle 42 is preferably about between<br>
5Â° and 85Â°, more preferably about between 10Â° and 45Â°, still more preferably about<br>
between 15Â° and 35Â°, and most preferably about between 20Â° and 30Â°.<br>
The preferred surface of revolution 104 extends substantially between first and<br>
second axial ends 105, 106. As the surface of revolution 104 is conical or tapered, the<br>
first axial end 105 has a smaller diameter than the second axial end 106. The first axial<br>
end 105 preferably faces the interior of the input container 12, with the second axial<br>
end 106 disposed on an opposite side of the surface of revolution 104. In the preferred<br>
embodiment, the diameter of the second axial end 106 is at least about 10% larger than<br>
the diameter of the first axial end 105. More preferably, second axial end diameter is<br>
about between 1.25 and 2.5 times the size of the first axial end diameter. The surface of<br>
revolution 104 preferably has an axial length of about between a quarter and twice the<br>
size of the first axial end diameter. In one embodiment, the first axial end diameter is<br>
about between 13 to 25 mm, and the second axial end diameter is about between 30 and<br>
35 mm, with an axial length between the axial ends of between about 10 and 25 mm.<br>
The diameter of the rotor, including of the axial ends are preferably measured to widest<br>
point at the station being measured along the axis 102. Thus, the diameter of a rotor<br>
with protrusions, such as ribs 113, is measured to the tip of the protrusions. Grooves<br>
1 1 1 on the surface of revolution are not deeper than about 6 mm in the preferred<br>
embodiment.<br>
The surface of revolution 104 preferably has a surface area of at least about 800<br>
mm2 and more preferably at least about 100 mm2, and preferably at most about 3000<br>
mm2 and more preferably at most about 2000 mm2. Most preferably, the surface area is<br>
of from about 1000 to 1200 mm2. This surface area is calculated taking the cross<br>
sections of the surface as being circular and having the diameter of the rotor at the<br>
relevant axial sections as described above.<br>
Additionally, in the embodiment shown, the axial ends 105, 106 are located at the<br>
extreme ends of the frustoconical rotor 101. In other embodiments, the axial ends 105,<br>
106 may be located remotely from the ends of the rotor. In one embodiment, the first,<br>
smaller axial end 105 is defined as being at the portion of the tapered rotor where the<br>
diameter becomes at least about 13 mm. Thus, this embodiment has a surface of<br>
revolution measured from the location on the rotor where the diameter becomes at least<br>
about 13 mm. This alternative embodiment may also have a second surface portion of<br>
the rotor that extends in the direction away from the second axial end, and which can be<br>
continuous and can follow the adjacent surface of revolution. The second surface<br>
portion may extend to the most upstream end of the rotor. In another embodiment, the<br>
surface portion is measured from the location on the rotor where the diameter becomes<br>
at least about 20 mm, and in yet another embodiment, it is measured from the location<br>
on the rotor where the diameter becomes at least about 25mm.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, the second or rear rotor face 48 preferably includes<br>
a recessed portion 50 facing in an opposite direction from the front face 44. In the<br>
drawings, the first 44 and second 48 rotor faces are disposed at the first and second<br>
axial ends 105, 106. In the alternative embodiment described in which one or both of<br>
the axial ends 105, 106 is located remotely from the end of the rotor itself, one or both<br>
of the axial ends and the rotor faces, respectively, are also disposed remotely from each<br>
other.<br>
The rotor 101 is disposed within a rotor housing 52, which in the embodiment<br>
shown is integral part of unitary construction with the input container 12. The preferred<br>
rotor housing 52 has an inner housing surface 54 with a shape substantially<br>
corresponding to the surface of revolution 104. A shear gap 56 is defined between the<br>
housing surface 54 and surface of revolution 104 that has a width selected to provide a<br>
sufficient flow rate and energy, transfer to the mixture, for a desired foaming effect.<br>
Measured in a direction perpendicular to the rotor axis 102, the shear gap 56 is<br>
preferably at least about 1.5 mm, more preferably at least about 1.8 mm, and most<br>
preferably at least 2 mm. Measured in this direction, the shear gap 56 is preferably at<br>
most about 3 mm and more preferably at most about 2.5 mm. In one embodiment the<br>
shear gap h about 2-2.5 mm, such as 2.25 mm. The conical shape of the surface of<br>
revolution 104 provides a long shear gap 56 for acting on the fluid mixture, while<br>
providing a pumping action and without requiring an extremely large radius.<br>
As shown in fig. 2 and 5, the downstream surface 103a preferably defines a<br>
plurality of rounded grooves 111, extending between the first 110 and second 106 end<br>
surfaces. The preferred grooves 111 could be twisted to spiral along the axial length of<br>
the rotor, however in the shown embodiment they extend in axial direction without<br>
twist. The grooves 1 1 1 of the present embodiment are about between 0.5 and 3 mm<br>
deep. The grooves 111 are preferably configured and dimensioned for keeping the<br>
relating motion of the fluid going. In the meantime the sheer gap 56 between the rotor<br>
and the housing acts to give the air bubbles in the froth a more uniform size, by<br>
breaking up the larger bubbles and creating smaller bubbles out of them. The more<br>
uniform size of the air bubbles gives the froth a belly appearance and the smaller size<br>
gives a better stability. In case of twisted grooves 111, the motor 30 can turn the rotor<br>
101 in or against the direction of the grooves 111 depending on the pumping and<br>
frothing effect desired. But also in case of non-twisted grooves 111, the motor can turn<br>
the rotor in two opposing directions.<br>
A wall member 57 including a back wall 58 is disposed behind the rotor, facing<br>
the second axial end 106 and the rear rotor face 48. Like in WO 03/068039, the back<br>
wall 58 can include protrusions, which are preferably at least one rib that protrude<br>
towards the rotor 101. However, contrary to WO 03/068039, the back wall 58 can, due<br>
to the present rotor design also be without protrusions.<br>
The rotor 101 is preferably spaced from the wall member 57. In the preferred<br>
embodiment, the second axial end 106 of the rotor 101 is spaced from the wall member<br>
57 at a spacing 90 of at least about 1,5 mm, more preferably at least about 2 mm, and<br>
most preferably at least about 3 mm. The spacing between the rotor 101 and the wall<br>
member is preferably at most about 8 mm, more preferably at most about 6 mm, and<br>
most preferably at most about 5 mm. A practical embodiment has a spacing of about<br>
2.5 mm near the centre and about 4 mm near the outer edge of the second end surface<br>
106.<br>
In order to provide sufficient room for the mixed and frothed fluid to exit the<br>
mixing device, the back wall 58 preferably has a larger outer diameter than the rotor<br>
101, preferably at least about 20% larger and more preferably at least about 30% larger,<br>
and further are preferably at most about 60% larger, and more preferably at most about<br>
40% larger. For example, the diameter of the back wall 58 can be about 37,5% larger<br>
than the diameter of the second axial end of the rotor. The outer diameter of the back<br>
wall 58 of the preferred embodiment is at least about 40 mm and at most about 60 mm.<br>
A product exit tube 72 is disposed downstream of the rotor 101 and back wall 58<br>
and is disposed to dispense the foamed fluid mixture. The product exit tube 72 is shown<br>
as an integral part of unitary construction with the input container 12. The product exit<br>
tube 72 preferably comprises a conduit with a diameter selected according to the final<br>
product that is to be dispensed. The preferred product exit tube 72 has an internal<br>
diameter of about between 2 mm and 8 mm for embodiments intended to prepare<br>
several different milk and coffee beverages. Embodiments intended primarily for coffee<br>
preferably have a product exit tube 72 with an internal diameter of about between 2 mm<br>
and 5 mm, and in embodiments intended primarily for milk, the internal diameter is<br>
preferably from about 4 mm to 8 mm. The diameter of the product exit tube 72 is<br>
selected to obtain the desired pumping performance from the rotor 101. Increasing the<br>
diameter of the conduit allows a faster flow, while decreasing the diameter provides<br>
more back-pressure to retain the fluid mixture in the rotor assembly and input chamber<br>
12 for a longer time. In embodiments used for milk and coffee beverages, the internal<br>
diameter of the exit tube 72 is according to the invention between 4 mm and 6 mm. An<br>
exit tube 72 with an internal diameter smaller than 2 mm, has the disadvantage that the<br>
properties of the materials used to manufacture the tube will increasingly (with<br>
decreasing diameter) start to interfere with the fluid. This could result in the liquid not<br>
wanting to pass through the exit tube as a consequence of for example adhesy, cohesy,<br>
hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties.<br>
In use, the fluid is tangentially introduced into the input container 12 through<br>
tangential inlet 16. In the preferred embodiment, the fluid comprises water, and the<br>
flow rate is about between 3 mL/sec and 30 mL/sec, more preferably about between 5<br>
mL/sec and 15 mL/sec, and most preferably about between 9 mL/sec and 12 mL/sec.<br>
At the time or preferably after the water flow into the input container 12 is commenced,<br>
a powdered food component, such as a powdered coffee product and/or powdered milk,<br>
is dosed into the water through powder inlet 18. Preferably the powder dosing begins at<br>
least about 0,1 sec after the water dosing begins and more preferably at least about 0.3<br>
sec. later, and preferably at most about 3 sec later, and more preferably at most about<br>
1.0 sec later. Preferably the water is continued to be fed into the input container 12 until<br>
the powder dosing is stopped, and preferably at most about 8 sec after the powder<br>
dosing ends, and more preferably at most about 3 sec later, and preferably at least about<br>
1.0 sec later.<br>
The water and powder start getting mixed in the swirling flow within the input<br>
container 12, including the throat portion 22. The rotor 101 is rotated by the motor 30<br>
at a speed sufficient for pumping the mixture towards the product exit tube 72 and for<br>
producing the desired foaming and aeration effect. The rotor 12 sucks in air for<br>
incorporation into the mixture. The configuration and location of the back wall 58 with<br>
respect to the rotor 101 continues the frothing effect, increasing the efficiency of the<br>
device. The rotation of the rotor 101 and the shape of the back wall 58 centrifugally<br>
keep the fluid product from accumulating behind the rotor. The speed of the rotor 101<br>
is preferably variable to enable a speed selection to deliver the desired amount of<br>
energy to the mixture to produce the desired frothing. For obtaining products of certain<br>
qualities, the rotation speed of the rotor 101 is varied between two or more speeds<br>
during the preparation of a single product.<br>
The device 10 provides a high specific energy dissipation to generate a milk froth<br>
and a moderately low specific energy dissipation to obtain a high quality coffee crema<br>
in the same unit. The frothed product is then dispensed through the product exit tube<br>
72.<br>
It has been found that to generate an authentic quality milk froth when using a<br>
milk powder in a beverage dispenser, the specific energy dissipation should be above<br>
about 1 J/g of product, which includes milk: powder and water together. Authentic milk<br>
froth as referred to in the present application is a frothed product with at least an equal<br>
volume of milk foam compared to the volume ofliquid. The milk, foam in the product<br>
having authentic milk, froth preferably has a density of about between 50 mg/L and 300<br>
mg/L. An authentic cappuccino can be made with the device of the present invention,<br>
which has a volume made up by about 1/3 coffee, about 1/3 frothed milk foam, and<br>
about 1/3 of milk that remained liquid after frothing. The preferred milk fraction in the<br>
authentic cappuccino has a volume that is at least as large as the volume of the liquid<br>
portion. The foam of the frothed milk in the final prepared beverage product is<br>
preferably stable, having at least about 2/3 of the foam volume remaining after 10<br>
minutes.<br>
The energy dissipation of the device can be controlled by adjusting the shear<br>
gap, rotor speed, and product flow rate, although these quantities are interdependent. A<br>
reduction in the shear gap, an increase in rotor speed, and a decrease in flow rate will<br>
provide a higher energy dissipation. The preferred flow rate is between at least about 5<br>
g/sec and up to about 30 g/sec, and more preferably at least about 8 g/sec and up to<br>
about 15 g/sec. If the size of the gap is reduced, the flow rates will correspondingly be<br>
reduced and the amount of air drawn into the gap will be reduced as well, reducing<br>
foaming and aeration, and friction is increased. Also, if the rotational speed (i.e.,<br>
"rpm") is increased, noise and cost of the machine will increase as well.<br>
The embodiments described above allow a device of compact size, and with a<br>
desirable flow rate for preparing individual drinks to be provided without requiring<br>
extremely high rotor speeds, such as of above about 30,000 rpm. The preferred<br>
rotational speed used for foamed coffee or milk froth are of from 10,000 to 30,000 rpm,<br>
most preferably between 10,000 to 25,000 rpm.<br>
However, also in the range below 10,000 rpm there is, compared with prior art<br>
devices operated at the same rotor speeds below 10,000 rpm, an improved performance<br>
with good frothing results. With respect to the prior art, good results are obtained with<br>
rotor speeds as from 3,000 rpm, preferably as from 5,000 rpm, more preferably as<br>
from 7,500 rpm, but still below or at 10,000 rpm.<br>
The rotor design according to the invention enables for example to operate a<br>
device according to WO 03/068039 to be operated at lower rotor speeds (i.e. lower<br>
rpm) without decreasing its reliability.<br>
Making the ribs at the upstream part of the rotory (i.e. the part where the hot<br>
water/ingredient mixture coming from the input container 12 above enters the rotor<br>
assembly) allows for (little) chambers 112 where un-dissolved larger ingredient<br>
particles can enter without blocking the movement of the rotor or cause any other<br>
damage. This consequently also allows for coarser ingredients (components) to be used.<br>
In the chambers 112 also air can be trapped, which is, when the rotor is rotating, beaten<br>
in the hot water-ingredient-mixture so that the frothing process is improved.<br>
When rotated at sufficient high speed, the ribs 112 create a greater turbulence<br>
enforcing contact between the water and the un-dissolved ingredient (component). In<br>
practise this greater turbulence extends not only over the upstream part of the rotor but<br>
also cover the downstream part (thus essentially over the entire rotor), which forces all<br>
the ingredient to be dissolved before it can stick to the rotor. In case some un-dissolved<br>
or partially dissolved ingredient is still sticking to the surface of the rotor or to the<br>
inside of the rotor chamber, this sticking ingredient will be removed by the violent<br>
movement of the water.<br>
The improved design of the rotor also makes - as experiments indicate - the<br>
dimensions as given in WO 03/068039 less critical.<br>
While illustrative embodiments of the invention are disclosed herein, it will be<br>
appreciated that numerous modifications and other embodiments may be devised by<br>
those skilled in the art. Therefore, it will be understood that the appended claims are<br>
intended to cover all such modifications and embodiments that come within the spirit<br>
