PHOSPHORYLCHOLINE GROUP-CONTAINING COMPOUND AND METHOD FOR PRODUCING SAME TECHNICAL HELD<br>
The present invention relates to a phosphorylcholine group-containing chemical compound and a method for manufacturing thereof.<br>
The phosphorylcholine group-containing chemical compound of the present invention is a useful compound as a surface treatment agent or a source material of a surface treatment agent for materials such as plastics, metal, and glass.<br>
The surface modifier consisting of the compound of the present invention can give biocompatibility, moisture retaining properties, hydrophilicity, and other various useful functions to objects. BACKGROUND ART<br>
Phosphorylcholine group-containing chemical compounds are used as surface treatment agents to improve biocompatibility and such. For example, in Patent document 1 they are used as surface treatment agents for diagnostic equipment and contact lenses for the purpose of decreasing the deposition of proteins and cells.<br>
In Patent document 1, the phosphorylcholine group-containing chemical compound used as a surface treatment agent is the compound of formula (I) in Claim 1 of the patent. This compound is obtained from a reaction of the carboxyl phosphorylcholine derivative shown in formula (V) in the right lower column of page 5. That is, an appropriate compound chosen from the carboxyl phosphorylcholine derivatives of general formula (V) is used.<br>
The appropriate carboxyl phosphorylcholine derivatives represented by formula (V) are compounds having chemical structures that are considered usable as a source material compound to manufacture the compound of surface treatment agent<br><br>
formula (I) and they are shown in the form of a general formula. In the right lower<br>
column of page 6 of the document, the following formula (4) is shown as the<br>
compound having the simplest structure that meets this general formula. From this it<br>
can be understood that the compound having the simplest structure that meets<br>
formula (V) is the most useful. This reaction formula (6) describes the compound of<br>
formula (4) as an ideal compound conceivable for use in a reaction to manufacture the<br>
compound of formula (I), a surface treatment agent; however, this is not an existing<br>
compound actually synthesized in Patent document 1: this is not a prior art compound<br>
actually synthesized.<br>
[Chemical formula 1]<br>
(CH3)3NCH2CH2P04C2H4COOH	(4)<br>
For the carboxyl phosphorylcholine having a simple structure that is a prior<br>
art compound included in general formula (V), the compound of the following<br>
formula (5) is reported to have been bought from Molecular Probe Inc. (Non-Patent<br>
document 1). However, Non-Patent document 1 does not mention specific synthesis<br>
examples, and no corresponding chemical compound has been found on Molecular<br>
Probe's website.<br>
[Chemical formula 2]<br>
(CH3)3NCH2CH2PO4C5H10COOH	(5)<br>
However, the compound of formula (5) is not sufficient for endowing these materials with maximum biocompatibility because of the spacer (C6H10 portion) that binds the phosphorylcholine group portion, which is involved in biocompatibility, and the material to be treated.<br><br>
With regards to methods for manufacturing phosphorylcholine compounds, several synthesis examples have been proposed (Patent documents 2-4, Non-patent documents 2).<br>
However, these methods use phosphorus oxychloride for the starting substance and therefore have a shortcoming in that they are cumbersome methods.<br>
For example, the reaction must be carried out under strict moisture-free conditions. Therefore, moisture in the reaction atmosphere must be removed as well.<br>
Also, the purification process for the target phosphorylcholine compound is cumbersome and its purification is quite difficult. The reaction yield is low as well.<br>
Furthermore, an organic solvent is used for the reaction solvent, which means purification of the reaction solvent (moisture removal) has to be carried out strictly and there are environmental problems due to the use of the organic solvent.<br>
As described thus far, conventional methods to manufacture phosphorylcholine compounds that use phosphorus oxychloride as the starting substance have many problems as an industrial manufacturing method.<br>

Patent Document 2: Japanese Patent Laid-Open S63-222183 bulletin<br>
Patent Document 3: Japanese Patent Laid-Open H7-10892 bulletin<br>
Patent Document 4: US Patent 5,648,442 bulletin<br>
Non-patent document 1: Journal of Protein Chemistry, 117 (10) 1 1991<br>
Non-patent document 2: Polymer Journal, vol.22 355-360 (1990) DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION [Problem that the present invention aims to solve]<br>
As described above, among the compounds included in general formula (V), those having the simplest structures are very useful.<br><br>
In view of the problems described above, the present invention provides a newly synthesized carboxyl phosphorylcholine; it provides the most ideal compound that has a structure even simpler than the compound of formula (4), which is the ideal compound among carboxyl phosphorylcholine derivatives of formula (V) in said Patent document 1.<br>
The method for manufacturing this compound is not a conventional method that uses phosphorus oxychloride as the starting substance; it is a reaction in a water based solvent (a reaction that does not require moisture-free conditions) using glycerophosphorylcholine as the starting substance, thus brilliantly solving many problems that come with the conventional method.<br>
Also, the chemical compound of the present invention is not only the source compound for manufacturing the compound of surface treatment agent formula (I) of Patent document 1 but also a compound that has been confirmed to be useful as a surface treatment agent by itself. The chemical compound of the present invention is used as a surface treatment agent; it allows the phosphorylcholine group portion, which gives biocompatibility, to reside closest to the material surface (the spacer is methylene, which is CI) and therefore various surface modification functions of phosphorylcholine groups including biocompatibility can be maximally manifested on the material surface. [Means to solve the Problem]<br>
That is, the present invention provides a phosphorylcholine group-containing chemical compound represented by the following general formula (1) or (2). [Chemical formula 3]<br>
(CH3)3N+CH2CH2P04"CH2COOH	(1)<br>
[Chemical formula 4]<br><br>
(CH3)3N+CH2CH2P04"CH2COONa	(2)<br>
Also, the present invention provides a method for manufacturing the phosphorylcholine group-containing chemical compound represented by the following formula (1) or (3) in which glycerophosphorylcholine, periodic acid and/or periodate in the amount of 3 or more equivalents of that of glycerophosphorylcholine, and a trivalent ruthenium compound are reacted in an aqueous solution. [Chemical formula 5]<br>
(CH3)3N+CH2CH2P04"CH2COOH	(1)<br>
[Chemical formula 6]<br>
((CH3)3N+CH2CH2P04"CH2COO)nMn+	(3)<br>
M denotes a cation, and n denotes the valency of the cation.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention provides a method for manufacturing the phosphorylcholine group-containing chemical compound represented by the following formula (1) or (3) in which glycerophosphorylcholine, periodic acid and/or periodate in the amount of 3 or more equivalents of that of glycerophosphorylcholine, and a divalent ruthenium compound are reacted in an aqueous solution. [Chemical formula 7]<br>
(CH3)3N+CH2CH2P04"CH2COOH	(1)<br>
[Chemical formula 8]<br>
((CH3)3N+CH2CH2P04"CH2COO")nMn+	(3)<br>
M denotes a cation, and n denotes the valency of the cation.<br>
Also, the present invention provides a method for manufacturing the phosphorylcholine group-containing chemical compound represented by the following formula (1) or (3) in which glycerophosphorylcholine, and permanganic acid and/or permanganate are reacted in an aqueous solution.<br><br>
[Chemical formula 9]<br>
(CH3)3N+CH2CH2P04"CH2COOH	(1)<br>
[Chemical formula 10]<br>
((CH3)3N+CH2CH2P04"CH2COO")nMn+	(3)<br>
M denotes a cation, and n denotes the valency of the cation.<br>
Furthermore,   the  present  invention  provides   a  surface   treatment  agent composed of a phosphorylcholine group-containing chemical compound represented by the following general formula (1) or (3). [Chemical formula 11]<br>
(CH3)3N+CH2CH2P04'CH2COOH	(1)<br>
[Chemical formula 12]<br>
((CH3)3N+CH2CH2P04'CH2COO")nMn+	(3)<br>
M denotes a cation, and n denotes the valency of the cation. [Effects of the invention]<br>
The new chemical compound of the present invention is a carboxyl phosphorylcholine that has the simplest structure and it is a highly useful compound. It is on its own used as a surface treatment agent; it allows the phosphorylcholine group portion, which gives biocompatibility, to reside closest to the material surface (the spacer is methylene, which is CI) and therefore surface modification functions of phosphorylcholine groups including biocompatibility is maximally manifested on the material surface.<br>
It is also possible to obtain a new surface treatment agent by reacting the new chemical compound of the present invention with a compound having a useful reactive group other than a carboxyl group. For example, a silane coupler having a phosphorylcholine group can be easily obtained by reacting the new chemical<br><br>
compound of the present invention with aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, i.e. it is useful for a source material (intermediate) for a surface treatment agent as well.<br>
The manufacturing method of the present invention is a simple manufacturing method using glycerophosphorylcholine for the starting substance. Glycerophosphorylcholine comes from naturally existing raw materials such as lecithin and can be obtained commercially at a low cost and in large quantities.<br>
It can be manufactured in a water based solvent. The reaction proceeds quantitatively and the yield is very high. Furthermore, the purification process is simple. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS<br>

Fig. 2 is a mass spectrum of the chemical compound of the present invention prepared in Example.<br>
Fig. 3 shows the reaction formula of Manufacturing method 1. BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The structures of the new chemical compounds (1) and (2) of the present invention are as follows. [Chemical formula 13]<br><br><br><br>
This compound can be prepared by stirring and reacting periodic acid and/or periodate in the amount of 3 equivalents or more of that of glycerophosphorylcholine, and a trivalent and/or divalent ruthenium compound in an aqueous solution (the reaction rate increases by addition of acetonitrile).<br>
Commercial products can be used for the glycerophosphorylcholine, periodic acid, periodate, trivalent ruthenium compound, divalent ruthenium compound, and acetonitrile. Examples of periodic acid include orthoperiodic acid, metaperiodic acid, and hydrates thereof. Examples of periodate include sodium periodate, potassium periodate, calcium periodate, and hydrates thereof. Examples of trivalent ruthenium compounds include ruthenium trichloride, ruthenium tribromide, tris (acetylacetonato) ruthenium, and hydrates thereof. Examples of divalent ruthenium compounds include hexaammine ruthenium dichloride, potassium hexacyanoruthenate, and hydrates thereof.<br>
When periodate is used, the compound of the following formula (1) or (3) can be prepared.<br>
In formula (3), M denotes the cation corresponding to the periodate, and n denotes the valency of the cation. Representative cations are alkali metal ions, alkali earth metal ions, and ammonium ion.<br><br><br>
M denotes a cation, and n denotes the valency of the cation.<br>
The periodic acid and/or periodate is characteristically used in the amount of 3 equivalents or more of the glycerophosphorylcholine. Preferably 4 equivalents or more should be used. Four equivalents or more will give a yield of almost 100%. If it is 2 equivalents, then the yield is low even if the reaction time is long, which is not suitable for practical use.<br>
The necessary amount of the trivalent and/or divalent ruthenium compound is only a catalytic amount (approximately 0.02 mole %).<br>
The reaction solvent is water. Organic solvents are not used, which is environmentally significant for an industrial manufacturing method. The addition of acetonitrile will increase the reaction rate. The mixing ratio of water and acetonitrile is not limited in particular. An organic solvent can be freely added to the water.<br>
The reaction proceeds sufficiently at room temperature.<br><br>
The reaction time is not limited in particular; approximately 2 hours is sufficient to complete the reaction with a virtually 100% yield.<br>
After completion of the reaction, the solvent is removed. The compound of the present invention can be extracted from the remaining solid by using methanol. Methanol is then removed to obtain the compound of the above formula (1) or (3). When sodium periodate is used, the compound of formula (1) or (2) of the present invention is obtained.<br>
The obtained compound can be recrystallized from a methanol solution at rest or by adding acetonitrile to obtain a higher purity target compound.<br>
The	compound	of	formula	(1)	is<br>
2[[[(carboxymethyl)oxy]hydroxyphosphinyl]oxy]-N,N,N-trimethyl-ethanaminium, and the compound of formula (2) is its sodium salt.<br>
The compounds of formula (1) and (2) can be separated by means of a prior art method. For example, the compound of formula (1) alone can be obtained by treating a mixture of formulas (1) and (2) with hydrochloric acid and such. Also, the mixture can be turned into the compound of formula (2) alone by neutralizing it with sodium hydroxide and such.<br>
Even when formula (1) and formula (2) are mixed together, they can be used as a surface treatment agent or as the source material to manufacture other compounds (such as surface treatment agents).<br>
In addition to the methods described above, the compound of formula (1) can be obtained by an oxidative cleave reaction of the proximal diol by using, as a catalyst, lead tetraacetate or permanganic acid supported in silica gel, tungsten, iron, vanadium, or molybdenum.<br><br>
The compound of formula (1) or (3) can be prepared by stirring and reacting glycerophosphorylcholine and permanganic acid and/or permanganate in an aqueous solution. Examples of permanganate include potassium permanganate, sodium permanganate, and hydrates thereof.<br>
The compound of the present invention can give biocompatibility, moisture retaining properties, hydrophilicity, and other various useful functions to objects. It is a very useful compound as a surface treatment agent or a source material for a surface treatment agent for various materials such as plastic, metal, and glass. EXAMPLES<br>
