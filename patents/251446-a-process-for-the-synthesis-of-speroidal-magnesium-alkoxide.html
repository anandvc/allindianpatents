Field of Invention<br>
The invention relates to spheroidal magnesium alkoxide particles having improved mechanical strength and narrow particle size distribution. The invention also relates to a method for synthesis of the alkoxide , to the Ziegler Natta procatalyst synthesized by using the alkoxide and to the polymer resin synthesised using the procatalyst.<br>
Background of Invention<br>
Resin particles having regular shape and narrow particle size distribution are desirable for good flowability during resin extrusion. They are also essential to produce regular shaped copolymer products with uniform rubber dispersion. Shape regularity and size distribution of polymer resin are usually related to the shape and size of the catalyst particles as well as of the solid reactants from which the catalyst particles are synthesized. Solid magnesium ethoxide is used as the reactant for the synthesis of Ziegler Natta catalysts used for olefin polymerization.<br>
WO 2005/044873 discloses a method for synthesizing spherical magnesium alkoxide particles by reacting magnesium with an alcohol mixture at a temperature below the boiling point of the mixture. The spherical magnesium alkoxide particles synthesized by the method are rather frangible and do not retain their morphology or particle size during the synthesis of Ziegler Natta procatalyst, especially when the procatalyst synthesis is carried out on a large scale. Further, the particle size distribution of the alkoxide particles synthesized by the above mentioned method need improvement.<br><br><br>

The invention provides a process for synthesis of spheroidal magnesium alkoxides having improved mechanical strength and narrow particle size distribution by reacting magnesium metal with a mixture of alcohols. The magnesium metal can be in the form of powder, granules or ribbon. The ratio of magnesium to the mixture of alcohols can be in the range of 1:2 to 1:20. The reaction is usually carried out at a temperature in the range of20°Ctol00°Candat a pressure of 0.1 to 5.0 atm. Reaction temperature is increased in a step wise manner to have improved kinetic control. The vapours of the alcohol mixture was recovered by condensing in the overhead condenser. The alcohol mixture left after the reaction was filtered and the filtrate was reused for the synthesis. The hydrogen gas produced during the synthesis was vented off. The reaction is carried out in the presence<br><br><br>
of an initiator such as iodine. Any halogen or halogen containing compound other than iodine can as well be used as the initiator. The mixture of alcohols used for the reaction is selected from the group consisting of methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol and isobutanol. Other aliphatic/ aromatic alcohols can as well be used for the reaction. Preferably, the mixture contain two alcohols, one of which is ethanol. One of the alcohols in the mixture is used in excess to work as the reaction solvent. Further, the reaction is carried out under inert atmosphere. The inert atmosphere is created in situ by hydrogen gas which is produced during the reaction.<br>
The spheroidal magnesium alkoxide particles of the invention comprise at least two different alkoxy groups, one alkoxy group being present in less than 40 percentage by weight and another alkoxy group being present in greater than 40 percentage by total weight of the particles. Preferably the alkoxy group that is present in greater than 40 percentage by weight of the total alkoxy content is an ethoxy group. The alkoxide particles of the invention have low surface area, typically in the range of 1 to 20 m /g. Apart from its utility in the synthesis of spheroidal Ziegler Natta procatalyst, the spheroidal alkoxide particles of the invention can be used for other applications as well. The spheroidal alkoxide particles of the invention can be used for coating inorganic support materials such as silica or zeolites.<br>
The spheroidal magnesium alkoxide particles of the invention are used for the synthesis of spheroidal Ziegler Natta procatalyst. The alkoxide particles can be optionally pretreated with titanium tetrachloride, before the procatalyst synthesis. The pretreatment<br><br><br>
is usually carried out by a 2-5 wt% solution of titanium tetrachloride in aromatic or aliphatic solvent. The procatalyst synthesis involves reaction of the magnesium alkoxide particles with TiCU and chlorobenzene wherein TiClx(OR1)y(OR2)z, where x, y, z is an integer from 0 to 4 and R , R is an alkyl or aryl group, is formed as a side product along with the procatalyst, during the synthesis. The side product is treated with a carboxylic acid chloride and the treatment results in the generation of internal donors. The preferred carboxylic acid chloride is benzoyl chloride. The quantity of in situ generated internal donors and consequently the composition of the procatalyst can be varied by varying the composition of magnesium alkoxide and amount of carboxylic acid chloride used for the treatment. The internal donors are used up during the synthesis of the procatalyst. The spheroidal procatalyst can be a diester based catalyst or a monoester based catalyst. Depending upon the specific requirements, catalysts based on other kind of internal donors can be prepared. Further, the spheroidal alkoxide particles of the invention can be used for the synthesis of spheroidal procatalyst on a large scale. The spheroidal procatalyst of the invention is used for the synthesis of spheroidal/ regular shaped polyolefin resin having narrow particle size distribution and improved particle size. The molecular weight distribution of the polyolefin can be varied by varying the composition of internal donor in the catalyst.<br>
The invention provides an economical method for synthesis of spheroidal magnesium alkoxide particles by recovering and reusing the mixture of alcohols used for the synthesis. The mixture of solvents is recovered through the vent condenser during the drying of the cake obtained after the reaction. Filtrate collected during slurry filtration is<br><br><br>
also directly reused. Further, the invention provides spheroidal magnesium alkoxide particles having regular shape, with narrow particle size distribution, high bulk density, high mechanical strength and crystallinity.<br>
The magnesium alkoxide particles, the Ziegler natta procatalyst and the polyolefin resin in the following examples have been characterised by various methods. The alkoxy content of the alkoxide particles are measured by gas chromatography of the solution made by hydrolyzing magnesium alkoxide in dilute mineral acid. The mean particle size and span is obtained by particle size analyzer using laser and optical diffraction method on CILAS 1180 particle size analyzer. Span is calculated by ratio of (D90-D10)D50 where if Dn = X microns then it signifies that n% of the total particle population is below X microns. Bulk density is measured by measuring the tapped volume and weight of certain quantity of powder and by dividing weight of the powder by the tapped volume. The circularity is measured from the analysis of scanning electron microscope image using an image analysis software. Circularity of a particle is = (area of 2 dimensional particle image)/(area of circle having same parameter as the particle). X-ray powder patterns were recorded using Bruker Advance D8 diffractometer. Morphology was explored with FEI Inspect Scanning Electron Microscope. Crushing strength was determined by applying a force increasing with constant rate to fixed volume of solid powder mass in a cylindrical vessel and determining the minimum force required for compressing the mass by 1 mm on veritical axis of force application. Donor content is determined using high pressure liquid chromatography of the catalyst solution in methanol. Polymer bulk density is<br><br><br>
calculated by measuring tapped volume and weight of fixed polymer resin quantity and then dividing weight by volume.<br>
The invention is further illustrated by way of the following examples<br>
EXAMPLES<br>

The vapours of the mixture produced during the reaction was condensed in an overhead condenser. The hydrogen gas produced during the reaction was vented off and the mixture of alcohols left after the reaction was removed by filtration. The filtrate was reused for the synthesis. A wet cake was obtained after removal of the filtrate.

Table 1 provides a comparative analysis of the magnesium alkoxide particles of the invention (prepared as in example 1) and of the alkoxide particles prepared as in example 2. The magnesium alkoxide particles of the invention had more circularity as compared to the magnesium alkoxide particles of example 2. Further, the crushing strength, particle size and bulk density of the particles of the invention are considerably higher than those<br><br><br>
prepared by example 2. The alkoxide particles of the invention possess narrow particle size distribution as evidenced by their low span values.<br>
Table 2 compares the properties of the Ziegler natta procatalyst prepared (as in examples 3 and 4 respectively) by using the alkoxide particles of example 1 and example 2. It can be seen that there is shape replication during the procatalyst synthesis of example 3 and circularity as observed in the alkoxide particles is almost retained in the procatalyst. Further, particle size values of the procatalyst of the invention suggests negligible attrition for the particles of the invention. Further, the procatalyst prepared by the alkoxide particles of the invention has narrow particle size distribution as evidenced by their low values of span.<br>
Table 3 compares the properties of the polymer resin prepared (as in examples 5 and 6) by using the procatalyst of example 5 and example 6. The resin particles prepared by example 5 have high particle size, narrow particle size distribution as well as high bulk density and circularity as compared to the resin particles prepared by example 6.<br>
The morphology of the alkoxide particles, procatalyst particles and the resin particles of the invention is compared in the respective SEM images of the particles. Figure 1, Figure 3 and Figure 5 of the accompanying drawings present the SEM images of the alkoxide particles, of the procatalyst particles and of the resin particles of the invention. Figure 2, Figure 4 and Figure 6 of the accompanying drawings present the SEM images of the alkoxide particles, of the procatalyst particles and of the resin particles prepared by<br><br><br>
example 2, example 4 and example 6 respectively. It can be clearly observed that the particles of the invention have regular spheroidal morphology which is retained during the procatalyst synthesis as well as during the resin synthesis.<br>
The invention, thus provides crystalline magnesium alkoxide particles having improved mechanical strength and narrow particle size distribution. Further, the alkoxide particles of the invention retains its morphology and particle size during subsequent procatalyst synthesis on a large scale. Furthermore, the retention of particle morphology is observed during the synthesis of the polymer resin. Therefore the magnesium alkoxide particles of the invention are suitable as precursors for the synthesis of regular shaped procatalyst and polymer resin. The invention also provides an economical, safe and environmentally friendly method for the synthesis of magnesium alkoxide particles by providing means for recovery and reuse of alcohol vapours during the alkoxide synthesis as well as by providing means for venting off the hydrogen gas produced during the synthesis.<br>

ABSTRACT <br>
The invention relates to a process for the synthesis of spheroidal magnesium alkoxide having improved mechanical strength and narrow particle size distribution, the process comprising reacting magnesium metal, in the presence of iodine, with a mixture of alcohols by step-wise heating first in the range of 40°C to 65°C for a period of 2 hours and then in the range of 65°C to 80°C for a period of 1 hour, further by maintaining reaction temperature at 80°C for a period of 6 - 10 hours, the vapours of the mixture produced during the reaction being condensed in an overhead condenser, hydrogen gas produced during the reaction being vented off and the mixture of alcohols left after the reaction being filtered and reused. The invention also relates to spheroidal magnesium alkoxide particles synthesized by the method, to the Ziegler natta procatalyst synthesized by using the alkoxide and to the polymer resin synthesised using the procatalyst.<br></td>
