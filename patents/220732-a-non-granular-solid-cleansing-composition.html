COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (See Section 10 and Rule 13)<br>
A NON-GRANULAR SOLID CLEANSING COMPOSITION<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai - 400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
ORIGINAL<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
GRANTED<br>
7-11-2007<br><br>
Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to non-granular solid cleaning composition. In particular, it relates to soap bars with lower levels of total fatty matter that maintain their integrity and shape and remaining microbially stable under varying storage and transport condition. The composition also provides for the desired user properties like lather, cleaning and low mush during use.<br>
Background and Prior art<br>
There have been many solid cleaning compositions comprising soap known in the art. It is believed that generally the cleaning action in soap bars is provided for by the soluble soaps i.e salts of fatty acids which are soluble in water while the insoluble soaps provide the integrity and structure the shape of the soap bar. There have been several attempts made to provide alternative, less expensive materials for structuring the shape of the bars.<br>
US 5194172 (P&amp;G, 1993) describes a process for preparing an aerated freezer soap bar which composition comprises 25 to 70% of alkali metal fatty acid soap, 5 to 35 wt% sucrose, 3 to 20 wt% of a hydrophobic material selected from waxes, free fatty acids and fatty alcohols wherein the hydrophobic material comprises at least 3 wt% waxes and 10 to 30% water and the composition does not contain effective amount of water-soluble organic non-soap synthetic detergent.<br>
US 4518517 (Colgate, 1985) describes a cleaning composition which may be liquid or a solid bar which essentially comprises an anionic detergent active which may be a synthetic detergent or a tallow or coconut fatty acid soap, and is characterized by inclusion of at least one carbohydrate selected from glucose, mannose and oligomers thereof at 2.5 to 10% wt% which is effective to reduce the odour causing bacterial population of the body without the use of antimicrobials.<br>
US 3630925 (Arrowhead, 1971) describes deodourant and germicidal bodies especially in the form of tablets or blocks for cleaning toilets and urinals which comprise 60 to 75% sugar, 20 to 25% water soluble soap and 2 to 5% water dispersible germicidal agent. The germicidal agents described include o-phenylphenol and 2,2"- methylenebis-3,4,6-trichlorophenol (which is also known as bis-(3,5,6- trichloro-2 hydroxyphenol) or 2,2"-dihydroxy-3,5,6,3",5",6"-    hexachlorodiphenylmethane    or    hexacblorophene).    Other<br><br>
germicidal agents which are described include quaternary ammonium salts such as p-diisobutyl phenoxy ethoxy ethyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chlo ride monohydrate, or benzalkonium chloride, or 2,4,5 trichlorophenol, or benzyl-o-chlorophenol.<br>
The present inventors have found that soap bars comprising sugars like mono or di saccharides tend to have poor stability on storage over extended time and/or under adverse conditions and are especially prone to attack by fungi. They also tend to have poor structural stability exhibiting problems like cracking of the bar. Also desirable user properties like lather tend to be effected. The present inventors have now found that a solid cleaning composition comprising soap at specific low levels of total fatty matter can be structured with mono or di saccharides and tend to have excellent storage stability against growth of microorganisms like fungi and provide the desired user properties like low mush, high lather etc. by incorporation of a stabilising agent in small amounts, preferably by further addition of free fatty acids in specific amounts. Further, it has been surprisingly found that a small amount of a known hardening agent like alkali metal carbonate or bicarbonate provides for significant improvement in structural integrity of the bar e.g. in terms of reduced cracking of the bar under storage and use conditions.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
It is thus an object of the invention to provide for a non-granular solid cleaning composition with reduced levels of total fatty matter which is stable against microbial contamination especially fungi under varied storage, transport and usage conditions.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to provide for a non-granular solid cleaning composition with reduced levels of total fatty matter which in addition to being stable against microbial contamination especially fungi under varied storage, transport and usage conditions, provides for the desired levels of cleaning and user properties like low mush, enhanced lather and also maintains structural integrity under all these conditions.<br>
It is yet another object of the present invention which in addition to the above objects can be prepared in a cost effective manner.<br><br>
Summary of the invention<br>

(a)	50 to 70% salt of fatty acid<br>
(b)	1 to 15% of a mono or disaccharide<br>
(c)	0.02 to 2% of a stabilising agent<br>

Detailed Description of the invention:<br>
The present invention provides for a cleaning composition that comprises salt of fatty acid, a mono or di saccharide and a stabilising agent.<br>
Salt of fatty acid:<br>
The term salt of fatty acid is also known as soap which denotes salts of carboxylic fatty acids for example sodium, zinc, potassium, magnesium, alkyl ammonium and aluminium salts of fatty acids. The soap may be derived from any of the triglycerides conventionally<br><br><br>
 in soap manufacture - consequently the carboxylate anions in the soap may contain from 8 to 22 carbon atoms.<br>
The soap may be obtained by saponifying a fat and/or a fatty acid. The fats or oils generally used in soap manufacture may be such as tallow, tallow stearines, palm oil, palm stearines, soya bean oil, fish oil, castor oil, rice bran oil, sunflower oil, coconut oil, babassu oil, palm kernel oil, and others. In the above process the fatty acids are derived from oils/fats selected from coconut, rice bran, groundnut, tallow, palm, palm kernel, cotton seed, soyabean, castor etc. The fatty acid soaps can also be synthetically prepared (e.g. by the oxidation of petroleum or by the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide by the Fischer-Tropsch process). Resin acids, such as those present in tall oil, may be used. Naphthenic acids are also suitable.<br>
Tallow fatty acids can be derived from various animal sources and generally comprise about 1-8% myristic acid, about 21-32% palmitic acid, about 14-31% stearic acid, about 0-4% palmitoleic acid, about 36-50% oleic acid and about 0-5% linoleic acid. A typical distribution is 2.5% myristic acid, 29% palmitic acid, 23% stearic acid, 2% palmitoleic acid, 41.5% oleic acid, and 3% linoleic acid. Other similar mixtures, such as those from palm oil and those derived from various animal tallow and lard are also included.<br>
Coconut oil refers to fatty acid mixtures having an approximate carbon chain length distribution of 8% C8, 7% C10, 48% C12, 17% C14, 8% C16, 2% C18, 7% oleic and 2% linoleic acids (the first six fatty acids listed being saturated). Other sources having similar carbon chain length distributions, such as palm kernel oil and babassu kernel oil, are included within the term coconut oil.<br>
A typical fatty acid blend consisted of 5 to 30% coconut fatty acids and 70 to 95% fatty acids ex hardened rice bran oil. Fatty acids derived from other suitable oils/fats such as groundnut, soybean, tallow, palm, palm kernel, etc. may also be used in other desired proportions.<br>
The soap in the present invention is present in an amount of 50 to 70%, preferably from 55 to 68% and more preferably from 58 to 68% by weight of the composition. It is preferable that the iodine value of the fat charge be in the range of 30 to 50, more preferably 34 to 46, most preferably 38 to 42.<br><br>
It is preferable that the moisture content of the composition is in the range of 9 to 20% and more preferably in the range of 12 to 16%.<br>
Mono or di saccharides:<br>
Any mono or disaccharides or a combination of two or more are present in the composition of the invention. The saccharides are preferably chosen from glucose, sucrose, mannose, or fructose. It is particularly preferred that the saccharide used is glucose or sucrose.<br>
The mono or di saccharide is present in an amount of 1 to 15%, preferably from 4 to 12%, more preferably from 5 to 10% by weight of the composition.<br>
Stabilising agent:<br>
The stabilising agent is preferably chosen from the class of fungicides.    Preferred<br>
stabilising agents include formaldehyde, benzoic acid and salts thereof, methyl or ethyl<br>
paraben.<br>
The stabilising agent is present in an amount of 0.02 to 2% by weight of the composition, more preferably in an amount of 0.05 to 1 % by weight of the composition. The stabilising agent is generally added in an amount which is sufficient to inhibit the growth of microorganisms e.g fungii on the composition and at the same time is not high such that it produces undesired characteristics e.g off-odours. E.g. a stabilising agent like formaldehyde is available as a solution in water e.g at 30 to 40% concentration and the solution may be added in an amount of 0.1 to 0.2 % by weight of the composition.<br>
Free Fatty Acids:<br>
Free fatty acids are preferably included in the composition of the invention. The free fatty acids may have carbon chain length in the range of 8 to 18 . The free fatty acid is preferably "lauric" fat. The coconut and palm kernel fats (together known as the lauric fats) are particularly rich in the C10-C14 saturated fatty acids, particularly fatty acid residues derived from lauric acid itself. For convenience these fats, containing saturated, relatively short chain fatty acids, are generally referred to as the "lauric" fats. This definition includes the coconut, palm kernel, babassu or macauba oils. The free fatty acids are preferably present in an amount of 0.5 to 6%, more preferably 0.5 to 2 % by weight of the composition.<br><br>
Alkali metal carbonate or bicarbonate:<br>
The composition of the invention preferably comprises an alkali metal carbonate or<br>
bicarbonate. The preferred compound is sodium carbonate.<br>
The alkali metal carbonate or bicarbonate is preferably present in an amount of 0.1 to 2% by weight of the composition, more preferably in an amount of 0.2 to 1.5% by weight of the composition.<br>
Process:<br>
The invention is carried out in any mixer conventionally used in soap/detergent manufacture and is preferably a high shear kneading mixer. The preferred mixers include ploughshare mixer, mixers with kneading members of sigma type, multi wiping overlap, single curve or double arm. The double arm kneading mixers can be of overlapping or tangential in design. Alternatively the invention can be carried out in a helical screw agitator vessel or multi head dosing pump/high shear mixer and spray drier combinations as in conventional processing.<br>
The invention will now be demonstrated with the help of typical non-limiting example of the process according to the invention as also with the help of comparative results of the composition prepared by the present invention and beyond the invention.<br>
EXAMPLES:<br>
Comparative Example A:<br>
A base soap bar of 72 TFM was made free of grit by milling in a roll mill and then<br>
plodded and stamped to get bars of desired shape.<br>
Comparative Example B:<br>
A bar was prepared by mixing a base soap of 65 TFM along with sugar and sorbitol as per the composition given in table-1. The mixing was done in a sigma mixer for sufficient time till there was no gritty feel. The mass was then milled in a roll mill and then plodded and stamped to get bars of desired shape.<br>
Example -1<br>
A bar as per comparative Example B was prepared except that an additional 0.2%<br>
formaldehyde was added during mixing.<br><br>
Table-1:<br><br>
Components	Comparative Example -A	Comparative Example -B	Example -1<br>

The samples of the products prepared were subjected to a stability test as per the procedure given below.<br>
Stability Test:<br>
Fungal spores of A. versicolor, A. niger and an isolate from a contaminated soap wrapper (Rexona) were used as a mixed challenge inoculum at a concentration of 107 per sq cm surface. The five samples challenged in this manner were incubated at 100% RH, 85% RH and ambient. Results after a month"s incubation are as given in Table-2:<br>
Table-2<br><br>
Test conditions	Comparative Example -A	Comparative Example -B	Example -1<br>
Ambient	+/-	+	+/-<br>
85% RH	+/-	++	+/-<br>
100% RH	+	++	+<br>
+/-       denotes no apparent growth or very slight indication.<br>
+	denotes spore germination / spore swelling<br>
++       denotes vegetative growth with little or no sporulation<br>
The data in Table-2 indicates that bars prepared as per the invention (Example-1) are stable and comparable to control bar (Comparative Example -A) while the bar containing sugar with no formaldehyde (Comparative Example - B) displays poor stability.<br>
User Properties:<br>
Bars were prepared as per the compositions given in Table-3.<br><br>
Table-3<br><br>
Components	Comparative Example - A	Comparative Example - C	Comparative Example - D	Comparative Example - E<br>
TFM	72	67	65	65<br>
Sugar	-	10	10	10<br>
Laurie Acid	-	-	2	2<br>
Sodium Carbonate				0.6<br>
Water	To 100	To 100	To 100	To 100<br>
The above samples were tested for user properties like mush volume, cracking, and lather.   The test procedures used were as follows.<br>
Mush Volume:<br>
The mush volume is measured on a bar composition that has been used. The depth of the mush is measured in millimeters and the area of the bar underface affected by the mush formation is measured. These measurements are made each day over a course of 4 days of use. The mush volume is obtained by summing the four daily ratings.<br>
Cracking:<br>
The bars were evaluated for cracking on a 14 point scale with a score of zero denoting no cracking and 14 denoting very severe cracking, over four days of use of the product.<br>
Lather volume:<br>
The bars were lathered with fixed amount of water of fixed hardness (4 FH) by trained<br>
operators using their hands with gloves. The procedure involved rubbing the bar wetted<br>
with water by twisting the bar 15 times in the hands, followed by lathering up the<br>
composition on the gloved hand with a specific number of rubs (20 rubs).   The lather<br>
generated is carefully transferred to a graduated cylinder and the lather volume<br>
measured.<br>
The samples were also subjected to the stability test as described earlier.<br>
The tests with the various samples gave the following results, tabulated in Table-4.<br><br>
Table-4<br><br>
Components	Comparative Example - A	Comparative Example - C	Comparative Example - D	Comparative Example - E<br>
Mush Volume	3.5	3.2	8.5	3.8<br>
Cracking	0	0	3.9	0<br>
Lather	298	275	339	303<br>
Stability	Poor	Poor	Poor	Poor<br>
Example-2:<br>
A sample as per Comparative Example - E was prepared except that it further contained<br>
0.2% formaldehyde.<br>
This bar was also assessed for the in-use and stability test. The bar as per Example - 2<br>
gave as good a in-use property as Comparative Example- E.  Additionally the bar was<br>
highly stable on storage to fungal growth.<br>
Comparative Examples F, G and Examples 3,4:<br>
Further samples of detergent bars were prepared as per the compositions given in<br>
Table- 5.<br>
The bars prepared were subjected to the stability test as conducted for Example-1 and<br>
the summary of the observations is also summarized in Table-5<br>
