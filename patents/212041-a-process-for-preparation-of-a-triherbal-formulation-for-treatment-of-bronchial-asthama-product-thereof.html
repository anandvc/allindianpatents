HERBAL BRONCHODILATOR FORMULATION<br>
Title : A PROCESS FOR PREPARATION OF A TREHERBAL FORMULATION OF TREATMENT OF BRONCHIAL ASTHAM &amp; PRODUCT THEREOF.<br>
Field   of  Invention:   The   present  invention   relates  to  a   process  for<br>
preparation of a herbal formulation of tejan, Bhootkeshi &amp; Nilnirgundi as a bronchodilator and the product of the process followed.<br>
GENERAL INTRODUCTION<br>
Now a days in India many peoples are suffering from the respiratory tract diseases like acute and chronic bronchitis, asthma, allergic respiratory tract disorders that causes bronchospasm and obstruction to the airways. Increasing pollution, bad dietary habits like fried food, uses of the air conditioners, cold drinks, oily foods, respiratory tract infections are the main causes of irritation of the bronchial mucosa. Many people are suffering from the occupation related bronchial and lung parenchymal diseases like silicosis, asbestosis etc. Bronchial asthma sometimes seen associated with inhalation of noxious gases like carbon monoxide, chlorine etc. Bronchial asthma may be hereditary and effect the children's in their growing years. There are many allopathic drugs are indicated for the treatment of acute and chronic bronchial asthma. There is no treatment for emergency asthmatic attack in any other pathy except allopathy. Drugs like Salbutamol, Deriphyllin, Ketotifen, Ephedrine are the commonly used bronchodilator drugs in allopathy, all the above drugs have their own serious side effects like palpitation, tremors, agitation, excessive sweating, dryness of mouth, due to its unwanted effects on other system viz., cardiovascular, central Nervous system, excretory system etc.<br>
AIMS AND OBJECTIVES<br>
Aims of creating this formulation is to developed a herbal formulation which is effective, potent, with no side effects like allopathic bronchod9ilators, which relieves not only acute and chronic bronchospasm but also effective in status asthmaticus.<br>
GENERAL OUTLINE OF THE BRONCHIAL ASTHMA<br>
Human respiratory tract has many components. The respiratory tract is divided in to the upper and the lower respiratory tract. Respiratory tract consist of the nose, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, and the right and the left lungs. Physiological aspects of the respiratory tract is dependent on the inhalation of the oxygen gas and the exhalation of the carbon dioxide in atmosphere. There are various processes are responsible for the healthy respiration. The upper and the lower respiratory tract are the major<br><br>
3<br>
components in respiration. After inhalation oxygen gas enters in to the respiratory tract i.e. in the alveoli, as it is a site of diffusion, at the same time carbon dioxide is thrown out of the respiratory tract though the process of exhalation. Any obstruction in these two processes causes asthma, and accumulation of the carbon dioxide in the blood and further tissue hypoxia, acidosis and death.<br>
Bronchial asthma is characterized by the paroxysms of Breathlessness and are seen during expiration, also there is a chest discomfort, expiratory wheezes, which is resulting from the narrowing of airways by a combination of muscle spasm i.e. smooth muscle spasm of bronchial wall, mucosal swelling of bronchial mucosa and viscid bronchial secretions.. These changes in bronchial mucosa are secondary to an inflammatory reactions with the bronchial wall involving mast cells, eosinophils, and other cells, due to allergies and infections.<br><br>
IN SHORT<br><br>
1] External causative agents<br>
[pollens, dust particles, animal dander, drugs, food<br>
like  oily food,  infections  like  bacterial  &amp; viral<br>
infections etc.]<br>
Illl <br>
2] Causes inflammatory and allergic Reactions in<br>
bronchial mucosa causes Excessive formation of<br>
bronchial secretions.<br><br>
3]   Further obstructions in the airways [BRONCHIAL ASTHMA] like bronchus, bronchioles etc.<br>
DIAGRAM<br>
Taking the importance and tenderness of the respiratory activity and system, the present invention comes out with a novel formulation via a specific process, which not only potentially cures allergic bronchial asthma acute and chronic bronchitis but also shows no side effects.<br><br>

METHODS IN PREPARATION OF THE DRUG<br>
THE APPERATUS REQUIRED FOR PREPARATION<br>
Herbs as mentioned above in the crude form, gas stove, two pressure cookers of 12 lit. capacity &amp; of same shapes i.e. vertical models , 1 14 meter long rubber tube, A metallic pot containing ice-cold water, Measuring pot, Wet cloth, Test tubes, Acids and Salts, Chemicals, Filter papers, vaporizer, Clock etc.<br>
The experimental outline of the invention is depicted in Figure 1.<br>
Our new herbal bronchdilator formulation is prepared by distillation. Before preparation of any herbal drug by the process of distillation we have to study this process properly in the following manner.<br>
AIMS OF DISTILLATION<br>
Many plants contain volatile oils as an active ingredients.<br>
Volatile oils are characterized by their odour, oil-like appearance and sometimes ability to volatilize at room temperature. Chemically, they are usually composed of mixtures of, for example, mohterpenes, sesquiterpenes and their oxygenated derivatives. Aromatic compounds predominate in certain volatile oils.<br>
Because they are 'considered to be the "essence" of the plant material, and are often biologically active, they are also known as "essential oils". The term "volatile oil" is preferred because it is more specific and describes the physical properties.<br>
In order to determine the volume of oil, the plant material is distilled with water and the distillate is collected in a graduated tube. The aqueous portion separates automatically and is returned to the distillation flask. If the volatile oils possess a mass density higher than or near to that of water, or are difficult to separate from the aqueous phase owing to the formation of emulsions, a solvent with a low mass density and a suitable boiling-point may be added to the measuring tube. The dissolved volatile oils will then float on top of the aqueous phase.<br>
MAIN PROCEDURE<br>
DISTI9LLATION AND PREPARATION OF DRUG<br>
Routs of Tejan 500 gms, Leaves of Bootkeshi 250 gms &amp; Leaves of Nilnirgudi 150 gms are clean thoroughly with the help of lukewarm water and dried in shade and   cut into 1mm size.<br>
The above brochodilator drug is prepared by the primary distillation process. Two pressure cookers say X and Y was used for this process. Alternatively the<br><br>
8<br><br>
8<br><br>
standard distillation apparatus can be used for the stove for heating purpose. The cooker X contains parts of the above mentioned herbs in the crude form and mixed together with the plain water in ratio of 1:8 [Drugs: water] Then cooker Y is kept in the metallic pot containing ice-cold water. A wet cloth from outside covers cooker Y to avoid excessive heating and for rapid condensation of the vapours. Both the cookers are closed properly. The Cooker X is heated for at least two hours up to 150-degree temperature. After proper heating of cooker X the vaporization of the mixture take place, the vapors from cooker X is now entering on to the cooker Y through an interconnecting tube, the temperature of cooker Y is steadily rising now, after completion of the process both the cookers were opened up after proper cooling, Now the cooker Y contains 1200 ml of a newly formulated drug. Which is again filtered in a glass beaker for at least two times to<br>
remove impurities and the foreign particles.   Then the whole amount of the formulated drug is stored in a plastic container.<br>
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION<br>
The newly Formulated bronchodilator liquid tried on the patients of the bronchial asthma by using vaporizer. 100 ml of liquid is poured in a plastic vaporizer and heated thoroughly, then ask the patient to inhale the vapors slowly with the normal breath for few minutes (Fig. 2).<br>
MECHANISM OF ACTION<br>
The newly formulated bronchodilator drug is directly acting on the bronchial<br>
smooth muscles, after inhalation the vapors enteres into the bronchus and<br>
bronchioles acting locally on the smooth muscles, it relaxes bronchial smooth<br>
muscles, and inhibit abnormal secretions produced after inflammatory or allergic<br>
reactions.<br>
IDENTIFICATION OF FOREIGN MATTER<br>
Identification of foreign matter is essential before and after its trials. We have to<br>
discuss all the points below.<br>
Medicinal plant materials should be entirely free from visible signs of contamination by moulds or insects, and other animal contamination, including animal excreta, hairs etc. No abnormal odour, discoloration, slime or signs of deterioration should be detected. It is seldom possible to obtain marketed plant materials that are entirely free from some form of innocuous foreign matter. However, no poisonous, dangerous or otherwise harmful foreign matter or residue should be allowed.<br><br>
°9<br>
During storage, products should be kept in a clean and hygienic place, so that no contamination occurs. Special care should be taken to avoid formation of moulds, since they may produce aflatoxins.<br>
Macroscopic examination can conveniently be employed for determining the pressure of foreign matter in whole or cut plant materials. However, microscopy is indispensable for powered materials.<br>
Any soil, stones, sand, dust and other foreign inorganic matter must be removed before medicinal plant materials are cut or ground for testing.<br>
Definition<br>
Foreign matter is material consisting of any or all of the following:<br>
-parts of the medicinal plant material or materials other than those named with<br>
the limits specified for the plant material concerned;<br>
-any organism, part or product of an organism, other than that named in the<br>
specification and description of the plarjt material concerned;<br>
-mineral admixtures not adhering to the medicinal plant materials, such as soil,<br>
stones, sand, and dust.<br>
Sample size<br>
It is difficult to prepare a pooled sample of foreign matter since most of it adheres<br>
to the medicinal plant materials which are intrinsically non-uniform.   Special<br>
procedures  requiring  considerable practice are therefore necessary.     The<br>
problem is especially difficult when the samples of unbroken crude medicinal<br>
plant materials selected are small;; they should be sufficiently large to be<br>
representative.<br>
MICROSCOPIC STUDY<br>
Study of the newly formulated drug is done under 40 x microscope in Ganesh Pathological lab, Measure by Mr. D.V.Sawant, Samll amount of the above liquid bronchodilator is observed under the microscope for the contamination of the microorganisms for 15 minutes.<br>

PRECLINICAL STUDY OF THE FORMULATED BRONCHODILATOR DRUG<br>
STUDY OF THE FORMULATED BRONCHODULATOR DRUG ON A GROUP OF FROGS<br>
AMIS  &amp; OBJECTIVES - To study the acute  and chronic toxicity of a  newly formulated drug by using heavy doses.<br><br>
12<br><br>
12<br><br>
PROCEDURE-<br>
For the animal study a group of four frogs of different weight is taken from the fresh water tank. Weight of these groups is measured with the help of an electronic weighing scale. Frog say A, B, C, D were marked with the small metallic name plate fixed in the superficial skin of the each frog. Frog weighting from 116, 132, 106, 98 GMS respectively [A, B, C, D] are taken up for further study. The daily dose 2 ml/kg of body wt. Of the formulated liquid drug is used in the individual frog orally with the help of a plastic syringe three times a day for a one month. After one month again their 'weight is measured.<br>
CONCLUSION<br>
After completion of study for one month on a group of frogs are showing the above formulated drug is non toxic, and can be tolerable in heavy doses, without any systemic side effects. Total weight of the group of frogs were same as before and after study.<br>
STUDY OF THE FORMULATED DRUG ON PILOCARPINE INDUCED DOG<br>
AIMS &amp; OBJECTIVE<br>
To see the bronchodilator action of a newly formulated drug.<br>
PROCEDURE<br>
The above experiment was done under the observation of a veterinary doctor in Masure. Here a pert dog was used of wt 9.500kgs for preclinical study. Bronchospasnm was induced with the help of pilocarprine injection with the proper dosage, after induction of asthmatic symptoms a newly formulated drug was introduced in the respiratory tract by using the neubeliser. Total quantity of the neubelising drug used is 1 ml for 5 minute intermittently by maintaining proper oxygenation. Cardie status and other systemic toxicity were observed throughout the study.<br>
CONCLUSION<br>
Respiratory rate is decreased after neubelisation of the formulated drug.    It is suggestive of reduction in bronchospasm i.e reduction of asthmatic symptoms.<br><br>
13<br>
CLINICAL TRIALS OR AN ACUTE STUDY OF THE DRUG<br>
Clinical trials of a newly formulated drug are conducted at Lilavati general hospital Masure, under the guidance of DR. Ravindra Nandedkar [Mpharm, Phd] and DR. Aparna Nandedkar [M.B.B.S]<br>
With the proper data's of clinical and preclinical study it was shown that our formulation is selectively acting on the respiratory system in all the patients of bronchial asthma with improving their quality of life and complete reduction of all symptoms in asthma. We have conducted single blinded clinical trials, i.e. the ingredients in this formulation are not known to the asthmatic patients. Now a days in our country we are using various instruments to measure the oxygen gas saturation in the blood; we can measure pulmonary functions by using an electronic instruments. The another instrument we are using here is a peak flow meter, it is an instrument that commonly used for the measurement of the expiratory air flow pressure. It has tow ends, among these two, oje end is completely closed and another end has a small tube like structure. After completion of treatment, ask the patient to blow forcefully in the open tube like structure of a peak flow mater. After forceful blowing for three times consecutively the total expiratory capacity is measured by value 800 L/MIN. In the conditions like bronchial asthma there was an obstruction during the expiratory phase because of the constructions produced in the bronchial or bronchiola. wall of the respiratory tract. Total three readings were taken before the onset of treatment and after completion of the treatment for comparison (Fig.3).<br>
SELECTION OF THE PATIENTS<br>
There was no particular criteria used for the selection of the patient. The patients of acute bronchial asthma following infections and allergic bronchial asthma are isolated for the clinical trials.<br>
During the clinical trials systemic changes were observed for adverse reactions. Cardiac status is monitored by using cardiac monitor. The small children's below age of three years are avoided for the clinical trials.<br>
PROCEDURE<br>
After collection of all the apparatus, ask the patient to sit on a chair in front of the vaporizer connected to the power plug. Now wait for few minutes till vapors will come out from an opening at the tip of vaporizer, then ask the patient to inhale the vapors slowly for at least five minutes.<br>
CONTRAINDICATIONS<br>
This drug is contraindicated in the small children's below the age of three years, also it should be avoided in pregnant and lactating mother as its action is not studied.<br><br>
14<br>
CONTRAINDICATIONS AND PRECATUTION.<br>
No side effects are seen during the pre clinical or clinical study of this new bronchodilator formulation i.e. the newly formulated bronchodilator drug is totally safe and this drug has no side effects i.e. in short the drug is non toxic.<br>
After safety and nontoxic report in the animal study the drug is studied in many patients of the bronchial asthma. In all the patients of bronchial asthma this drug is producing bronchodilation without any side effects. This drug is not studied in children's below the ageof three years and in pregnancy &amp; lactating mothers.<br>
SIDE EFFECT<br>
This drug has no side effects, there is no anaphylactic, toxic reactions were seen during the study.<br>
STORAGE<br>
Generally plant materials should be entirely free from visible signs of contamination by moulds or insects, and other animal contamination, including animal excreta. No abnormal odour, discoloration, slime or signs of deterioration should be detected. It is seldom possible to obtain marketed plant materials that are entirely free from some form of offensive foreign matter. However, no poisonous, dangerous or otherwise harmful foreign matter or residue should be allowed.<br>
During storage, products should be kept in a clean and hygienic place, so that no contamination occurs. Special care should be taken to avoid formation of moulds, since they may produce aflatoxins.<br>
Macroscopic examination can conveniently be employed for determining the present of foreign matter in whole or cut plant materials. However, microscopy is indispensable for powdered materials.<br>
Any soil, stones, sand, dust and other foreign inorganic matter must be removed before medicinal plant materials are cut or ground for testing.<br>
Definition<br>
Foreign matter is material consisting of any or all of the following:<br>
-parts of the medicinal plant material or materials other than those named with the<br>
limits specified for the plant material concerned;<br>
-any organism, part or product of an organism, other than that named in the<br>
specification and description of the plant materials concerned;<br>
-mineral admixtures not adhering to the medicinal plant materials, such as soil<br>
stones, sand, and dust.,<br>
Sample size should be another factor of importance as less or excess sampling may<br>
modify results.  Out newly developed bronchodilator drug was prepared by using all<br>
the precautions that mentioned above.  This newly formulated bronchodilzator drug<br>
can be stored at room temperature between 25 to 40 degree, avoid, freeing.<br><br>
15<br>
15<br>
Protect from sunlight.<br>
OVERDOSAGE.<br>
No adverse effects are seen during the preclinical or clinical trials. This drug is used in groups of frogs for one month in heavy doses, but no any adverse reactions were observed in frogs. This formulated drug can be tolerable in heavy doses 02 ml/kg body wt.]<br>
CRITERIA USED FOR THE STUDY OF FORMULATION<br>
CONCLUSION OF THE PEAK FLOW METER STUDY<br>
Peak flow meter study is indicating the difference between initial reading (before the treatment) and the reading after the treatment of asthma, here both colors are representing two different readings, the comparative study of the both stages with the help of graphical representation shows effectiveness of the formulated drug.<br>
BEFORE THERAPY<br>
AFTER THERAPY<br>
RESPIRETORY RATE<br>
In all types of bronchial asthma respiratory rate would be the criteria used for the determination of severity of asthmatic condition. Increase respiratory rate more than the normal at resting state is strongly suggesting the pathological changes in the respiratory tract. During the clinical trials respiratory rate is measured before and after therapy. Inspection is the best method for observation of the respiratory rate. Auscultation is an another method used for the examination of the respiratory tract, stethoscope is used for the auscultation.<br>
MISSOULA-VITAS QUALITY OF LIFE INDEX<br>
This index is also used as one of the criteria for the study of the new formulations. While doing the study of various formulations quality of life is measure by using Missoula-vitas quality of life index, Before clinical trials quality of life is measured and then it was compared with the quality of life after completion of the treatment. The comparative study between the two stages indicates prognosis of the patients or volunteers.<br>
CONCLUSION<br>
After recollection of the complete date, we can strongly conclude that, our new herbal bronchodilation formula is an unique herbal medicinal formula which is more effective in bronchial asthma without any side effects; it has selective action on the respiratory tract after<br>
16<br>
inhalation of vapors within few minutes it relaxs bronchial smooth muscles, it is completely<br>
free form any toxic chemical substances; also it has rapid onset of action.<br>
FLOW METER STUDY BEFORE AND AFTER TREATMENT<br><br>
16<br>
