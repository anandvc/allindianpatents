				<td>NEW SPIROTRICYCLIC DERIVATIVES AND THEIR USE AS<br>
PHOSPHODIESTERASE-7 INHIBITORS Field of the invention.<br>
The invention relates to spirotricyclic derivatives, the process for their preparation, and their use as phosphodiesterase 7 (PDE7) inhibitors.<br>
Background of the invention.<br>
Phosphodiesterases (PDE) play an important role in various biological processes by hydrolysing the key second messengers adenosine and guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphates (cAMP and cGMP respectively) into their corresponding 5'-monophosphate nucleotides. Therefore, inhibition of PDE activity produces an increase of cAMP and cGMP intracellular levels that activate specific protein phosphorylation pathways involved in a variety of functional responses.<br>
At least eleven isoenzymes of mammalian cyclic nudeotide phosphodiesterases, numbered PDE 1 through PDE 11, have been identified on the basis of primary structure, substrate specificity or sensitivity to cofactors or inhibitory drugs.<br>
Among these phosphodiesterases, PDE7 is a cAMP-specific PDE. The biochemical and pharmacological characterization showed a high-affinity cAMP-specific PDE (Km=0.2 uM), that was not affected by cGMP potent selective PDE isoenzyme inhibitors.<br>
PDE7 activity or protein has been detected in T-cell lines, B-cell lines, airway epithelial (AE) cell lines and several foetal tissues.<br>
Increasing cAMP levels by selective PDE7 inhibition appears to be a potentially promising approach to specifically block T-cell mediated immune responses. Further studies have demonstrated that elevation of intracellular cAMP levels can modulate inflammatory and immunological processes. This selective approach could presumably be devoid of the side effects associated with known selective PDE inhibitors (e.g. PDE3 or PDE4 selective inhibitors) and which limit their use.<br>
A functional role of PDE7 in T-cell activation has also been disclosed; therefore selective PDE7 inhibitors would be candidates for the treatment of T-cell-related diseases.<br><br>
AE cells actively participate in inflammatory airway diseases by liberating mediators such as arachidonate metabolites and cytokines. Selective inhibition of PDE7 may be a useful anti-inflammatory approach for treating AE cells related diseases.<br>
Thus, there is a need for selective PDE7 inhibitors, which are active at very low concentrations, i.e. preferably nanomolar inhibitors.<br>
WO 88/01508 discloses compounds of formula<br><br>
(Figure Remove)<br><br><br>
where   R   is   hydrogen,   alkyl,   alkoxyalkyl,   hydroxyalkyl,   halo,   cyano, carbamoyl, alkyl carbamoyl, formyl, alkylamino or amino; X is -(CR4R5)a-NR6-(CR4R5)b-; R1, R2, R3, and R5 are hydrogen or alkyl;<br>
R4 and R6 are hydrogen, alkyl or aralkyl; a and b are 0,1 or 2 and a + b = 0,1 or 2; R4 and R5 groups on vicinal carbon atoms may together form a carbon-carbon double bond; and geminal R4 and R5 groups may together form a spiro substitutent, -(CH2)d-, where d is 2 to 5; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. These compounds are described as cardiotonics.<br>

Use of a prodrug of a compound of the invention such as it would occur to one skilled in the art (see Bundgaard, et al., Acta Pharm. Suec.. 1987; 24: 233-246), is also contemplated.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
The products of the invention are administered in the form of compositions, which are appropriate for the nature, and severity of the complaint to be treated. The daily dose in humans is usually between 1 mg and 1 g of product, which may be taken in one or more individual doses. The compositions are prepared in forms which are compatible with the intended route of administration, such as, for example, tablets, coated tablets, capsules, mouthwashes, aerosols, powders for inhalation, suppositories, enemas, foams (such as rectal foams) gels or suspensions. These compositions are prepared by methods which are familiar to those skilled in the art and comprise from 0.5 to 60% by weight of active principle (compound of the invention) and 40 to 99.5% by weight of a pharmaceutical vehicle or carrier which is appropriate and compatible with the active principle and the physical form of the intended composition.<br>
Solid form preparations include powders, tablets, dispersible granules, capsules, cachets, and suppositories. A solid carrier can be one or more substances which may also act as diluents, flavouring agents, solubilizers, lubricants, suspending agents, binders, or tablet disintegrating agents; it can also be an encapsulating material. In powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid, which is in a mixture with the finely divided active component. In tablets, the active component is mixed with the carrier having the necessary binding properties in suitable proportions and compacted in the shape and size desired. The powders, tablets, cachets or encapsulated forms for capsules preferably contain 5% to about 70% of the active component. Suitable carriers are magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, lactose, sugar, pectin, dextrin, starch, tragacanth, methyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, a low-melting wax. cocoa butter, and the like.<br>
Tablets, powders, cachets, and capsules can be used as solid dosage forms suitable for oral administration. The drug may be delivered as a spray (either in a pressurized container fitted with an appropriate valve or in a non-pressurized container fitted with a metering valve).<br>
Liquid form preparations include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions.<br>
Sterile water or water-propylene glycol solutions of the active compounds may be mentioned as an example of liquid preparations suitable for parenteral administration. Liquid preparations can also be formulated in solution in aqueous polyethylene glycol solution.<br>
Aqueous solutions for oral administration can be prepared by dissolving the active component in water and adding suitable colorants, flavouring agents, stabilizers, and thickening agents as desired. Aqueous suspensions for oral use can be made by dispersing the finely divided active component in water together with a viscous material such as natural synthetic gums, resins, methyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, and other suspending agents known to the pharmaceutical formulation art.<br>
For preparing suppository preparations, a low-melting wax such as a mixture of fatty acid glycerides and cocoa butter is first melted and the active ingredient is dispersed therein by, for example, stirring. The molten homogeneous mixture is then poured into convenient sized molds and allowed to cool and solidify. Enemas are obtained according to known procedures to prepare solutions adapted for rectal administration. Foams are prepared according to known methods (these foams can notably be similar to those used to administer a drug such as 5-ASA for treating rectocolite).<br>
Preferably the pharmaceutical preparation is in unit dosage form. In such form, the preparation is divided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of drug. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing discrete quantities of the preparation, for example, packaged tablets, capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules. The unit dosage form can also be a capsule, cachet, or tablet itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any of these packaged forms.<br>
