				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to an improved method<br>
of manufacturing Mg-Al and Mg-Cr spinel grains for making<br>
refractories used in ferrous and non-ferrous industries.<br>
The invention relates more particularly to a method of manufacturing Mg-Al spinel grains frlgAl2O4) and Mg-Cr spinel grains (MgCr2O4) at a relatively low temperature and hence at a reduced cost.<br>
The existing method of manufacturing Mg-Al apinel grains(MgAl2O4) and Mg-Cr spinel grains (MgCr2O4) requires  melting of the ingredients at a high temperature of around<br>
   2406 K, and hence the cost of manufacture in the existing<br><br>
      method is relatively high.ln recent years the demand for high<br><br>
  quality synthetic refractories,such as, those made from Mg-Al<br><br>
and Mg-Cr spinel grains, of increased hardness,  reduced thermal<br><br>
conductivity and adequate chemical Inertness has been growing      rapidly for applications in the ferrous and non-ferrous<br>
industries, necessitating increased production of said spinel grains at a reduced cost.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a method of manufacturing Mg-Al and Mg-Cr spinel grains at a reduced temperature and hence at a reduced cost.<br>
The invented method comprises basically wet milling of ingredients such as alumina (Al2O3) or chromic oxide (Sr2O3) and magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)2) with water in the required quantity in a ball mill to produce a slurry of the materials, drying the slurry formed in an air oven at 110 + 10°C into lumps/cakes, grinding/pulverising the lumps/cakes into granulated<br>
powders of required mesh size such as 30 B.S.,  mixing the powders with a binder such as a 2% by weight solution of dextrin<br>
in water in a mixer,  pressing the mix into briquettes/bricks of<br>
2 required sizes at a pressure of around 1.5 t/cm ,   drying the<br>
briquettes/bricks in a dryer at 110 + 10°C,  sintering/firing the dried briquettes/bricks in a furnace/kiln at 1600-1650°C,  cooling the briquettes/bricks to ambient temperature in natural air, Crushing and grinding the briquettes/bricks into grains of sizes such as -6 B. S.  mesh,  and screening the grains into required size fractions.<br>
4<br>
A large number of experiments have been performed for optimising the composition of the ingredients used in the invented method of manufacturing the Mg-Al and Mg-Cr spinel grains.<br>
Thus the invention provides an improved method of manufacturing Mg-Al and Mg-Cr spinel grains for making refractories used in ferrous and non-ferrous industries,  characterised in that the method comprises the following steps in sequence:    (i)  wet milling of 65-70% by weight of alumina (Al2O3) and equivalent amounts of Mg(OH)2 for 30-35% by weight of MgO for producing Mg-Al spinel grains and 72-77% by weight of chromic oxide  (Cr2O3) and equivalent amount of Mg(OH)2 for 23-28% by weight of MgO for producing Mg-Cr spinel grains v/ith required quantity of water at the  room temperature in a ball mill using sintered alumina balls as the grinding medium for at least 4 hours to produce a slurry of the said materials in water,   (ii) processing the  slurry through a filter press to convert the same  into the form of cakes,  (iii) drying the cakes in a dryer at 110 + 10°C for at least 24 hours, (iv) pulverising the  cakes into powders in a pulveriser,   (v) mixing<br>
 10% by weight of a binder with the powders in a mixer,   (vi)<br>
converting the mix into the form of briquettes/bricks by pressing<br>
the same at a pressure of around 1.5  t/cm2    in a press,   (vii)<br>
drying  the  briquettes/bricks in a dryer at 110 + 10°C for at least 24 hours,   (viii)  firing/sintering the briquettes/bricks in a furnace/kiln at 1600-1650°C for at least 6 hours,   (ix) crushing the briquettes/bricks into particles in a crusher,   (x) grinding the particles into grains in a grinder and (xi) screening the grains into the required size  fractions,   such as,   +3 to -5 mm, +1  to -3 mm,   +0.5 to -1 mm,   +O.2 to -0.5,  and -0.2 mm or as required.<br>
The invention is described fully and particularly with reference  to  the accompanying drav/ings,  in which<br>
Figure  1 is a flow diagram of the steps followed in the invented method of manufacturing Mg-Al and Mg-Cr spinel grains.<br>
Referring to Fig.   1,   raw material 1  i.e.   alumina (A1203)  and raw material 2 i.e.  magnesium hydroxide  (Mg(OH)2) or raw material 3,  i.e.  chromic oxide  (Cr2O3)  and raw material 2 i.e.  magnesium hydroxide  (Mg(OH)2)  are v/et milled together for 4 hours  in a ball mill using sintered alumina balls as  the grinding medium with water in the  required quantity to produce a slurry of the materials,   the slurry is stored in a blunger and is passed through a filter press to produce cakes of the materials,  the cakes are dried at 110 + 10°C in a dryer for at least 24 hours,  the dried cakes are pulverised into pov/ders in a pulveriser,  9 parts by v/eight of the pulverised powders and 1 part by v/eight of a binder such as 2% by weight of<br>
a solution of dextrin in water are mixed in a mixer, the mix is converted into briquettes/bricks in a press at a pressure of<br>
around 1.5 t/cm2 , the briquettes/bricks are dried in a dryer at 110 + 10°C for 24 hours, the dried briquettes/bricks are fired/sintered in a furnace/kiln at 1600-1650°C for 6 hours, the fired/sintered briquettes/bricks are crushed into particles<br>
in a crusher, the particles are ground into grains in a grinder,<br>
the grains are screened into required size fractions by using<br>
screens of required mesh sizes and stored as the finished product. Alternatively, instead of pulverising the dried cakes into powders in a pulveriser, these are sintered in a kiln at 1600-1650°C for 6 hours, the sintered cakes are crushed into particles in a crusher, the particles are ground into grains in a grinder, the grains are screened into different size fractions by using screens of required mesh sizes and stored as the finished product.<br>
The results of chemical analysis of alumina (Al2O3) and chromic oxide (Cr203) used are presented in Tables I and II respectively, from which it is noted that the said ingredients are of high purity i.e. 99% and above by weight. The magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)2) used is of extra high purity of above 99.9% by weight.<br>
A typical experiment performed on a pilot scale for optimising the composition of Mg-Al and Mg-Cr spinel grains in the invented method is described below by way of Example.<br>
A 5 kg batch containing  (by weight) 68% alumina and equivalent amount of Mg{OH)2 for 32% MgO or 74.5% chromic oxide and equivalent amount of Mg(OH)2 for 25.5% MgO with 8 to 12 kg water is milled in a ball mill for 4 hours using sintered alumina balls as the grinding medium to produce a slurry of the materials.    The slurry is dried in an oven at 110 ± 10°C for at least 4 hours to be formed into lumps.    The lumps are ground into particles in a grinder and screened through a 30 B.S. mesh sieve.    9 parts by weight of the grains are mixed with  1 part by<br>
weight of a binder such as 2% by weight of dextrin solution in<br>
water and pressed under a pressure of 1.5 t/cm2 and formed into<br>
briquettes. The briquettes are dried in an oven at 110 + 10°C for at least 24 hours. The dried briquettes are fired at 1600-1650°C for at least 6 hours in a furnace. The fired briquettes are cooled to ambient temperature in natural air. The cooled briquettes are crushed into particles in a crusher, the particles are ground into grains in a grinder, the grains are screened into the required size fractions by using screens and stored as the finished product.<br>
Typical thermo-physical properties of the spinel grains produced are given in Table III, from which it is noted that both Mg-Al and Mg-Cr spinel grains produced in the invented method are of high grain density i.e. 3.31/3.80 gm/cc, low app. grain porosity 2.18/4.07%, low water absorption 0.66/1.08% and high tensile strength 650/450 kg/cm2.<br><br>
The highest temperature used in the  invented process being 1600-1650°C against 1800-1900°C used in the conventional method,  the cost of manufacture is relatively low in the invented method.<br>
