CUTTING MECHANISM HAVING ADJUSTABLE CUTTER HOLDER<br>
This invention relates to a cutting mechanism of a forming machine, more particularly to a cutting mechanism having a cutter holder which is adjustable in position to align a feed receiving slot in a cutter blade with a feed channel in a forming machine to which the cutting mechanism is attached.<br>
Forging machines usually have a cutting mechanism to cut a roll of strip or a continuous rod into pieces which are used as blanks.  The cut blanks are held by a clamping unit to undergo different forging steps.  Figures 1 and 2 show a cutting mechanism 9 mounted on a machine frame,90 which has a feed channel 901 disposed on. The cutting mechanism 9 includes a fixed seat 91 fixed to the machine frame 90, a cutter holder 93 movable in a cutting direction 92 and mounted on the fixed seat 91, a cutter seat 94 disposed at a front end of the cutter holder 93, a cutter 95 mounted on the cutter seat 94 and having a feed receiving hole 951, a fixed plate 96 connected to a rear end of the cutter holder 53 , a cam plate 97, and a returning unit 98 projecting from -the fixed plate 96.  The cam plate 97 is driven by a power-operated drive mechanism  (not  shown)  to move to-and-fro along a working direction 99.<br>
The cutter holder 93 of the cutting mechanism 9 has a front end 931 which is provided with a first mounting face 93 2 parallel to the cutting direction 92, and a second mounting face 933 perpendicular to the cutting direction<br><br>
2<br>
92.  The cutter seat 94 has first and second abutment faces 941 and 942 to respectively abut against the first and second mounting faces 932 and 933. The feed receiving hole 951 is aligned with the feed channel 901 of the machine frame 90 along an axial direction. The fixed plate 96 has a flat face 961  with a rear end of the fixed seat 91. The cam plate 91 is provided with a cam face 971 confronting a roller 931 of the cutter holder 93.  The cam face 971 has a starting point 972 and a pushing point 973 having a high difference with the starting point 972 . The returning unit 98 includes two guide rods 981 parallel to the cutting direction 92 and connected fixedly to the cutter holder 93, and two springs 982 sleeved respectively onto the guide rods 981.<br>
When the cutting mechanism 9 is in an inoperative position, the starting point 972 of the cam plate 97 is in alignment with the roller 931, and the cutter holder 93 is urged by the springs 98 2 to move rearward, i.e. rightward as shown in Figs. 1 and 2. In this state, the feed slot 951 of the cutter 95 is aligned with the feed channel 901. When the cutting mechanism 9 is changed to a cutting position as shown in Fi 1 the cam plate 97 is moved in the working directions 99 so that the pushing point 973 thereof is aligned with the roller 931. In this state, the cutter holder 93 is moved forward against the biasing force of the springs 982 so that a feed rod from the feed channel 901 is cut off.  The cut rod is advanced into the feed receiving hole<br><br>
3<br>
951 shown in Figure 1.<br>
During the operation of the cutting mechanism 9, it is necessary to align precisely the feed receiving hole 951 of the cutter 95 with the feed channel 901 so as to permit the feed rod to extend into the feed receiving hole 951 for cutting. However, due to the accumulated tolerances between machine components of the cutting machine 9, the feed receiving hole 951 may be unable to be aligned with the feed channel 901 after the machine components are assembled, or after the cutting mechanism 9 has been used for a period of time.  Thus, adjustment of the cutting mechanism 9 is generally necessary.   In the cutting mechanism 9, the cutter 95 is adjusted in position to move leftward or rightward by grinding the first mounting face 932 and to move rearward by grinding the second mounting face 933.  in audition, the position of the cutter 95 is adjusted to move slightly forward by placing a packing member at the front side of the flat face 961 of the fixed plate 96, or by Grinding the connecting faces at the joint of the fixed seat 91 and the fixed plate 96.  Inconveniences . are encountered in adjusting the cutting mechanism 9 due to a need to grind the first and second mounting faces 933, 932 and the connecting faces of the fixed seat 91 and the fixed plate 96.  Furthermore, if the position of the feed receiving hole 951 still cannot be aligned with the feed channel 901 after grinding, the cutter 95 has to be detached from the cutter holder 93 to proceed with further grinding.<br><br>
4<br>
Detaching  and  reattaching  of  the  cutter  95  is  a time-consuming task.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a cutting mechanism of the above-mentioned type with improvements such that adjustment can be performed easily and quickly.<br>
According to this invention, a cutting mechanism for a forming machine which has a machine frame with a feed channel is provided. The cutting mechanism is characterized by: a support wall having a mounting hole, and an internal wall face confining the mounting hole; a cutter holder seat inserted into the mounting hole and mounted movably on the support wall, the cutter holder seat including a sleeve wall defining a sleeve hole; a spring-loaded cutter holder disposed movably within the sleeve hole and including a front cutter seat at a front end thereof: and a cutter attached to the cutter seat and having a feed receiving slot to be aligned with the feed channel, the cutter being movable forward and rearward, wherein the cutter holder and the cutter are adjustable in position by moving the cutter holder seat so that the feed receiving slot is aligned with the feed channel.<br>

Fig. 9 is the same view as Fig. 7 but with the cutter holder seat being changed in position through an adjustment using a cam plate.<br>
Referring to Figures 3 and 4, there is shown a preferred embodiment of a cutting mechanism according to the present invention, which may be installed on a component part-forming machine. The component part-forming machine includes a machine frame 1, a support wall 11 having an internal wall face 13 defining a mounting hole 12, and a feed channel 10 extending in a direction perpendicular to the mounting hole 12. The internal wall face 13 includes a small diameter section 131, a large diameter section 132,<br><br>
6<br>
and a shoulder 133 formed between the small and large-diameter sections 131, 132.<br>
Referring to Figures 5 and 6 in combination with Figures 3 and 4, the cutting mechanism includes a cutter holder seat 2 inserted into the mounting hole 12 and mounted adjustably on the support wall 11, a press unit 3 disposed in the mounting hole 12 for retaining the cutter holder seat 2 in the mounting hole 12, a cutter holder 4 movable to-and-fro along a cutting direction 14, a returning unit 5, a cut for 6 attached to a front end of the cutter holder 4, and a cam plate 8 for operating and moving the cutter holder 4 forward along the cutting direction 14.<br>
The cutter holder seat 2 is mounted on the support wall 11, and is inserted into the mounting hole 12 and includes a sleeve wall 21 defining a sleeve hole 22, and front collar 23 and rear coupling block 24 both of which project radially from the sleeve wall 21. The sleeve wall 21 is provided with a plurality of first spring slots 211 which extend in parallel to the cutting direction 14 and which are communicated with the sleeve hole 22. The sleeve hole 22 has a small cross-section front part 221, and a large cross-section rear part 222. The front collar 23 includes a substantiall, annalar abutment face 231 in abutment with the shoulder 133 of the support wall 11, a subscantially annular face 232 opposite to the abutment face 231, and four inclined faces 233 which are spaced-apart angularly at an outer periphery of the collar 23 .  Each inclined face<br><br><br><br><br><br>
7<br>
233 extends  from are outer end of the abutment face 231 to the annular face 232 and faces the internal wall face 13 of the support wall 11 in the large diameter section 132.<br>
The rear coupling block 24 includes a base wall 241,<br>
upper and lower leg parts 242 projecting rearwardly from the base wall 241, and a limit groove 243 formed between the leg parts 242. Each leg part 242 has a first slanting end face 244.<br>
The cutter holder seat 2 further includes a channel member 7 which is coupled with the coupling block 2 4 through adjustment screws 70. The channel member 7 includes a channel, bottom wall 71, two flanks 72 projecting from the channel bottom wall 71, and a slide channel 73 defined by<br><br>
4 and which has a non-pushing face 822 and a pushing projection 823 .<br>
Referring again to Figures 3 and 4, when the cutting mechanism is in a non-operacive state, the non-pushing face 822 of the cam plate 8 is in contact with the roller 43 so that the cutter holder 4 is moved rearward by the returning unit 5.The feed receiving slot 621 of the cutter blade 62 is therefore aligned with the feed channel 10.<br>
Referring once again to Figures 3 and 7, the cutting mechanism changes from the non-operative state (Figure 3) to the operative or cutting state shown in Figure 7. The pushing projection 323 of the cam plate 8 moves gradually to the roller 43. when the pushing projection 823 reaches the roller 43, the cutter holder 4 moves forward against the force of the returning unit 5 so that the feed receiving slot 621 of the cutter blade 62 is out of alignment with the feed channel 10 and the feed rod in the feed receiving slot 621 is cut off. As the cam plate 8 reciprocates, the cutter holder 4 moves rearward again due to movement of the non-pusning race 822 to the roller 43, and the cutting mechanism returns to the non-operative state.<br>
According to the present invention, the position of the feed receiving 521 of the cutter blade 62 can be adjusted by changing the position of the cutter holder 4 . The cutter holder 4 may be changed in position by adjusting the cutter holder seat 2. Adjustment of the cutter holder seat 2 is permitted without detaching the cutter holder seat 2 from<br><br>
11<br>
the support wall 11.<br>
Referring to Figure 8 in combination with Figure 6, when it is necessary to move leftward and upward the cutter blade 62, adjustment may be made by loosening the mounting screws 32 of the upper and lower wedge blocks 31 at the left (see Figure 6) and by tightening the mounting screws 32 of the upper and lower wedge blocks 31 at the right (Figure S) so that the front collar 23 is moved leftward and upward. Since the cutter holder 4 and the cutter 6 are connected Co the sleeve wall 21 and the front collar 23, the feed receiving slot 621 of the cutter blade 62 is moved upward and leftward so that the feed receiving slot 621 can be aligned with the feed channel 10 .  The function of the thrust screws 33 of the wedge blocks 31 is to release the wedge block 31 which will become stuck due to prolong use after the mounting screws 32 are loosened. Each thrust screw 33 may be threaued inco the corresponding wedge block 31 so as to move the wedge block 31 in the direction 14.<br>
Referring to Figure 9 in combination with Figure 3, when it is necessary to move the cutter 6 forward, the adjustment screws 70 of the channel member 7 must be first loosened so as to place temporarily the channel member 7 in a loose state. If the cutter 6 is to be moved forward, the channel member 7 may be moved in a direction 100 for adjustment. After adjustment, the adjustment screws 70 are tightened again to secure the channel member 7 to the cutter holder seat 2  As the channel member 7 is moved in a direction<br><br>
10 0, the channel member 7 moves forward so that the cam plate 7, the roller 43, and the cutter holder 4 are moved forward, thus moving the cutter 6 together with the feed<br>
receiving slot 621 forward.<br>
As mentioned above, adjustment of the cutter 6 may be done by moving slightly the front collar 23 or the channel member-7, and the front collar 23 and the channel member 7 may be moved by merely loosening the mounting screws 32 and the adjustment screws 70. According to the present invention, it is not necessary to detach or disassemble any component, part of the cutting mechanism. Adjustment of the cutter 6 is therefore quick and easy.<br><br>
