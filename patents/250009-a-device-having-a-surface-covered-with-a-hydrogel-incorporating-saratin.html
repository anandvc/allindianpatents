				<td>Summary of the invention<br>
The invention relates to the effect of a polypeptide called Saratin that significantly<br>
decreases platelet adhesion and accumulation after vascular injuries such as<br>
endarterectomy. The invention furthermore relates to the inhibition of vWF-<br>
dependent binding of platelets to vascular wall collagens under conditions of<br>
elevated shear and in more detail, to a novel medical use of Saratin as an<br>
inhibitor of thrombosis wherein said polypeptide may be used locally as a topical<br>
agent or as a coating for medical devices.<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The adhesion of blood cells especially platelets to the wall of injured blood<br>
vessels is a well known phenomen in angioplasty and surgical procedures. Such<br>
injuries may occure during various surgical and percutaneous therapies that have<br>
been developed to reopen blocked channels, conduits, and other lumens, to<br>
remove diseased tissue, and to implant substitute tissue, or components thereof.<br>
Various types of intervention techniques have been developed which facilitate the<br>
reduction or removal of the blockage in the blood vessel, allowing increased<br>
blood flow through the vessel. One technique for treating stenosis or occlusion of<br>
a blood vessel is percutaneous balloon angioplasty. A balloon catheter is<br>
threaded through the patient's-arterial system and inserted into the narrowed or<br>
blocked area, and the balloon is inflated to expand the constricted area.<br>
Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTCA) is the most widely angioplasty<br>
method used to open obstructed atherosclerotic arteries.<br>
Generally, angioplasty procedures produce excellent results obviating the need<br>
for bypass surgery, but in about 30 - 40% of patients, an ostensibly successful<br>
initial dilatation of the artery may be followed by a renarrowing of the vessel<br>
(restenosis) some 3 to 9 months later. If this restenosis is severe, the patients<br>
may require a second angioplasty procedure, often with implantation of a stent to<br>
act as a scaffold in the vessel.<br>
In other cases arterial reconstruction under by-pass surgery, which is a higher<br>
risk procedure, may be required. With more than 800,000 PTCA procedures now<br>
performed world-wide annually, the socio-economic implication of this 30 - 40%<br>
restenosis rate has become a matter of serious concern to interventional<br>
cardiologists.<br>
Restenosis is often the result of the balloon-mediated stretch and crush injury to<br>
the arterial wall and the possibility that the guide wires of the catheters used in<br>
such procedures during deployment cause injuries and can lead to proliferation of<br>
the smooth muscle cells of the artery, resulting in reclosure of the artery<br>
("restenosis") over the following months.<br>
Because of the potential complications, related to restenosis and the fear of<br>
dislodging an embolus from an ulcerative plaque and the severe resulting<br>
consequences, the application of repetitive angioplasty in the carotid arteries are<br>
severely limiting the options for minimally invasive intervention.<br>
Attempts heretofore have been made to treat occlusions in the carotid arteries<br>
leading to the brain by a other types of interventions.<br>
Carotid Endarterectomy is a surgical method for removal of blockages from the<br>
carotid arteries and is one of the most common vascular surgical procedures<br>
performed in the United States. Results from multicenter trials have demonstrated<br>
the efficacy of this procedure in the treatment of extracranial carotid disease in<br>
both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients (JAMA 1995; 273:1421-28; N Engl.<br>
J. Med. 1991; 325:445-53) and Endarterectomy procedures are used in the<br>
treatment of occlusive vascular disease in other vascular beds (Vase. Surg.<br>
1999;33:461-70).<br>
In endarterectomy, the carotid artery is slit and plaque is removed from the vessel<br>
irrthe slit area. In a surgery, the carotid bifiircation is exposed through an incision<br>
in the neck ofthe patient and clamps afe-placed on either side of the occlusion to<br>
isolate it, and an incision made to aperrthe artery. The occlusion is removed, the<br>
isolated area irrigated and aspirated, and the artery sutured closed. The clamps<br>
are removed to reestablish blood flow through the artery. The emboli and debris<br>
contained within the clamps may cause considerable-problems after the carotid<br>
artery is opened, allowing blood to flow into the previously isolated are.<br>
While endarterectomy is an effective therapy, it often leaves the adventitia and a<br>
significant area of thrombogenic subendothelium exposed. Despite the efficacy of<br>
carotid endarterectomy, the operation can lead to complications including<br>
thrombosis and the development of intimal hyperplasia causing complications<br>
that undo the beneficial effect of the intervention, or create new problems.<br>
Clinical studies have demonstrated a post carotid endarterectomy stroke rate of<br>
1-10% in the immediate postoperative period, almost all of which is accounted for<br>
by thrombus formation at the endarterectomy site with subsequent cerebral<br>
embolization (Stroke 1984;15:950-55). Platelet accumulation may also result in<br>
restenosis due to intimal hyperplasia development, which may occur within two<br>
years postoperatively. Restenosis has been reported to occur in 10-20% of all<br>
endarterectomized patients at 2-5 years postoperatively, most of which is due to<br>
intimal hyperplasia, intimal thickening, and vessel diameter reduction as<br>
documented by carotid duplex ultrasonic scanning (J. Vase. Surg. 1986;3:10-23).<br>
The cellular and molecular response of the vessel wall to mechanically induced<br>
trauma, surgical intervention, stent placement, placement of a vascular graft<br>
(arterial, or arteriovenous graft e.g.,. dialysis graft) is a complex interaction of<br>
inflammation, smooth muscle cell migration, proliferation and myofibroblast<br>
transformation that occurs as soon as the trauma occurs (Futura;1997.p.289-<br>
317). If the artery is severely damaged by disease, and perhaps hardened by<br>
calcium deposition, intervention may also cause some degree of additional injury<br>
with local de-endothelialisation and exposure of underlying extracellular matrix<br>
components such as collagen and elastin. In some patients the excessive<br>
recruitment of platelets and fibrinogen can then result in an acute thrombotic<br>
occlusion.<br>
Studies using endarterectomized rat carotid artery models (Neurosurg<br>
19B5;16:773-79), as well as embolectomy balloon injury models (Lab. Invest<br>
1983;49:327-33) have shown that as the endothelial ceils are steiped away during<br>
vascular injury, platelets begin to adhere to the exposed subendothelium.<br>
Spalloneet. al. (Netirostrrg 1985;16:773-79) using scanning electron microscopy<br>
have shown that five minutes after a carotid endarterectomy in a rat, a monolayer<br>
of platelets is formed over the injured area. Fifteen minutes- after the injury,<br>
platelet aggregation and thrombus formation are-observed. Thirty minutes post<br>
endartefeetomy, the site is covered with activated platelets and coated by fibrin<br>
and red blood cells. Thrombus formation reaches its peak at three hours post<br>
injury with a thick fibrin-platelet layer being observed. Platelets are an integral<br>
component of this thrombus formation and hence thrombosis, but they also<br>
appear to play a role in the development of intimal hyperplasia.<br>
Studies using thrombocytopenic rats have further demonstrated a significant<br>
decrease in intimal thickening following carotid artery injury as compared to<br>
control rats (Proc. Natl. Acad. SCI USA 1989;86:8412-16). Once platelets adhere<br>
to the exposed subendothelium of an injured vessel, they become activated and<br>
release their granules. These granules contain vasoactive and thrombotic factors<br>
(serotonin, ADP, fibrinogen, Von Willebrands factor, thromboxane A2), as well as<br>
growth factors (platelet derived growth factor, transforming growth factor-beta,<br>
and epidermal growth factor) (Circulation 1985;72:735-40). The exact<br>
mechanisms by which platelets enhance the development of intimal hyperplasia<br>
are not yet completely understood. Studies suggest that platelets provide<br>
primarily a chemotactic stimulus for medial smooth muscle cell migration toward<br>
the intima during the second phase of intimal hyperplasia development (Vase.<br>
Surg. 1991;13:885-91). Other studies, using anti-PDGF antibodies, have<br>
demonstrated the vital role that PDGF plays in neointimal smooth muscle cell<br>
accumulation following a vascular injury (Science 1991;253:1129-32). Another<br>
mechanism by which platelets may enhance the development of intimal<br>
hyperplasia is via the activation of the coagulation cascade and the subsequent<br>
accumulation of thrombin at the site of injury. Several studies have demonstrated<br>
the myogenic effects of thrombin on smooth muscle cells (J. Clin. Invest.<br>
1993;91:94-98, J. Vase. Surg. 1990;11:307-13). In addition, thrombin has been<br>
shown to be a stimulus for platelet activation. Irrespective of the precise<br>
mechanism, platelet adhesion and activation atihe site of a vascular injury play a<br>
significant role in the development of thrombosis and intimal hyperplasia and<br>
hence inhibition of platelet adhesion and activation may help, prevent or reduce<br>
thrombosis rates and intimal hyperplasia development.<br>
The adherence of platelets to the injured arterial wall is mediated in the first<br>
instance by von WUiebrand factor (vWF), a muKimeric glycoprotein that is<br>
released from endothelial cells and circulates in the plasma, where it functions as<br>
a carrier protein for factor VIII (Annu. Tev. Biochem. 1998;67:395-424). Highly<br>
multimerized vWF also circulates contained within alpha-granules of platelets,<br>
from where it is released foUosniflg platelet activation (Annu. Tev. Biochem.<br>
19^-67:395-424). Under elevated: steesr coraiitions, such as those encountered<br>
in arteries at sites of atheromatous plaque or mechanical intervention, vWF may<br>
bind, via its A3 domain, to surface-exposed collagen fibers (Biochemistry<br>
1986;25(26):8357-8361, Blood 1987;70(5): 1577-1583, J. Biol. Chem.<br>
1987;262(28):13835-13841). Collagen-bound vWF in turn then "tethers" platelets<br>
via shear-dependent exposure of an epitope in the vWF-A1 domain, which<br>
interacts with platelet GPIb/IX/V (Blood 1985;65(1):85-90, Blood 1985;65(4):823-<br>
831, Br. J. Haematol 1986;63(4):681-691). Thus vWF acts as a bridge between<br>
collagen and platelets and is a prerequisite for the adhesion of platelets to<br>
collagen under flow (J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1974;83(2):296-300). Platelet rolling over<br>
vWF results in weak adhesion, however, and additional, direct interactions<br>
between collagen and other receptors on the platelet surface are required in<br>
order to facilitate permanent platelet adhesion, activation and aggregation<br>
(Thromb. Haemost 1997;78(1):434-438, Thromb. Haemost 1997;78(1):439-444).<br>
Direct collagen receptors on platelets include GP VI (Blood 1987;69(6):1712-<br>
1720, Thromb. Haemost 1999,81 (5):782-792, J.Clin. Invest. 1989;84(5):1440-<br>
1445), GP la/lla (cfe/BO (J.Clin. Invest. 1989;84(5):1440-1445, Nature<br>
1985;318(6045):470-472), and to a lesser extent GP IV (CD36) (J. Biol. Chem.<br>
1989;264(13):7576-7583) and perhaps even p65 (J. Clin. Invest.<br>
1997;100(3):514-521). In the absence of vWF-assisted platelet binding, these<br>
receptors have proven to be too weak in mediating platelet recruitment to<br>
collagen in flow (Br. J. Haematol 1986;63(4):681-691). Finally vWF, in<br>
combination with fibrinogen, facilitates the cross-linking and further activation of<br>
platelets via binding to platelet GP llb/llla (J. Clin. Invest 2000;105(6):783-791),<br>
providing stability and strength to the developing thrombus.<br>
With the advent of platelet GP llb/llla and ADP receptor antagonists great strides<br>
forward in anti-aggregatory therapy have been made in recent years (Coronary<br>
Art Dis 1999;10(8):553-560, J. Am, Coll. Surg. 2000;191(1):76-92). However,<br>
these strategies afe not designed to inhibit the initial adhesion of platelets to<br>
exposed collagen fibers, and despite the efficacy of GP llb/llla antagonists in<br>
attenuating platelet-platelet interactions, platelets still adhere to the injured vessel<br>
wall (Blood 1993;81(5):1263-1276, Circulation T995;91 (5): 1354-1362).<br>
Furthermore, platetet^ctivaticai^Imc^txertainly extends beyond aggregation and<br>
acute thrombosis, the progression of sub-acute and chronic intimaJ hyperplasia<br>
being at least partially affected by mitogenic mediators such as platelet-derived<br>
growth factor (PDGF), released by the activation of platelets. Indeed, the<br>
inhibition of PDGF has been demonstrated to reduce infimal hyperplasia in<br>
various animal species (Science 1991 ;253(5024):1129-1132, Circulation<br>
1999;99(25):3292-3299).<br>
The pathophysiological importance of vWF is suggested by the increase in<br>
circulating vWF in patients with acute myocardial infarction (Thromb Haemost<br>
2000;84:204-209, Circulation t998;98(4):294-299), with vWF levels being<br>
positively correlated with poor subsequent prognosis (Circulation 1998;98(4):294-<br>
299). In vivo studies have further shown that neutralizing anti-vWF antibodies<br>
inhibit experimental thrombosis, confirming the essential role of vWF in thrombus<br>
formation (Thromb. Haemost 1998;79(1):202-210). Furthermore, with the ever<br>
more widespread use of angioplasty techniques in acute coronary syndromes,<br>
which invariably results in damage to the vessel wall and exposure of collagen,<br>
there is an increasing need for strategies that intervene pharmacologically as<br>
early as possible during the platelet adhesion-activation-aggregation cascade.<br>
The two main lines of therapy, which are currently being used in an attempt to<br>
control platelet adhesion, activation and subsequent thrombosis and intimal<br>
hyperplasia, are anti-platelet agents and anti-thrombotic administration. Although<br>
drugs such as aspirin effectively block the synthesis of Thromboxane A2 through<br>
inhibition of the cyclooxygenase pathway, they do not prevent the collagen-<br>
induced platelet adhesion and activation, which stimulate the development of<br>
intimal hyperplasia. The use of heparin as an antithrombotic agent is associated<br>
with complications and limitations including a non predictable dose response,<br>
need for dose laboratory monitoring, limited activity against clot bound thrombin,<br>
multiple inhibitory sites, antithrombin III dependency, a risk of major bleeding, as<br>
well as a need for continuous infusion. Clearly, an ideal therapeutic agent would<br>
be one that produces site specific and localized effects without systemic<br>
distribution or a generalized coagulopathy.<br>
It appears that the vital steps which precipitate the cascade of events leading to<br>
thrombosis and later intimal hyperplasia stem from the interaction between the<br>
exposed subendothelial collagen at the site of vessel injury and a monolayer of<br>
platelets which adhere to the exposed collagen. Hence a specific inhibitor of the<br>
platelet to subendothefel coHagen adhesion may serve to prevent or at least<br>
decrease the development of thrombus and intimal hyperplasia.<br>
Several leech-derived substances have been reported to inhibit collagen-platelet<br>
interactions (Blood 1995; 85I3):705-711, Platelets 2000; 11(2):83-86, J. Biol.<br>
Chem. 1992; 267(10):6893-6898, J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267(10):6899-6904, Blood<br>
Coagol-Btbrinolysis 1991, 2(1): 179-184). Ctestabtese, an isopeptkdase with fibrin<br>
depoiymerising activity isolated from Htrudo medicinaiis, has been reported to<br>
inhibit platelet aggregation induced by various agonists, including collagen, but is<br>
believed to bind directly to the platelet membrane (Platelets 2000; 11(2):83-86).<br>
Leech antiplatelet protein (LAPP), a -13 kDa protein from the saliva of<br>
Haementeria officinalis, inhibits platelet adhesion to collagen under static<br>
conditions (J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267(10):6899-6904, Thromb. Haemost 1999,<br>
82(3): 1160-1163) and elevated flow (Arterioscler Thromb. Vase. Biol. 1995,<br>
15(9): 1424-1431), with effects on both vWF- and platelet GP la/lla-mediated<br>
binding to collagen (Thromb. Haemost 1999, 82(3): 1160-1163). Calin is a -65<br>
kDa protein from Hirudo medicinalis for which a similar profile has emerged. Calin<br>
also inhibits collagen-platelet interactions under both static and flow conditions<br>
(Blood 1995; 85(3):705-711, Blood Coagul Fibrinolysis 1991, 2(1 ):179-184,<br>
Thromb. Haemost 1999, 82(3): 1160-1163). Furthermore, both LAPP and Calin<br>
are potent inhibitors of collagen-induced platelet aggregation, inhibiting<br>
aggregation at concentrations similar to those which block vWF binding to<br>
collagen (J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267(10):6893-6898, Blood Coagul Fibrinolysis<br>
1991, 2(1):179-184, Blood 1995, 85(3):712-719).<br>
Both LAPP and Calin have been evaluated in models of thrombosis in vivo, with<br>
mixed success. LAPP failed to reduce thrombus formation on collagen-coated<br>
grafts in a baboon arterio-venous shunt despite the use of doses that inhibited<br>
collagen-induced platelet aggregation (Arterioscler Thromb 1993, 13(11): 1593-<br>
1601), whereas Calin dose-dependently inhibited thrombus formation in a<br>
hamster model of venous thrombosis (Blood 1995, 85(3):712-719).<br>
Non thrombogenic and anti thrombogenic coatings for stents and catheters are<br>
known in the art. The non thrombogenic coatings and products are based on<br>
modified and advanced polymers and examples are given in WO9301221 and<br>
WO9830615.<br>
Anti thrombotic and anti restenosis coatings are in general biocompatible<br>
coatings that may also serve as reservoirs for local drug delivery. The coatings<br>
are mainly based on hydrogels and examples in the patent literature of methods<br>
for preparing various types of hydrogels and coating medical devices include<br>
W09211896, W09811828, WO0147572, EP0887369 and WO0139811.<br>
The release profile of the therapeutic substances that are contained within the<br>
coating can be adjusted for example by varying the thickness of polymer layers or<br>
by selecting specific polymeric coatings that contribute selected physikochemical<br>
properties (such as charge, hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity) and/or by preparing the<br>
coating as different layers. The criteria for selection of the polymer and the<br>
optimisation of release rate are understood by one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
Other coatings are described by Fischell Circulation, 1996, 94:1494-95), Topol et<br>
al (Circulation, 1998, 98:1802-20) and McNair et al in device Technology, 1996,<br>
16-22.<br>
The use- of stents, wires and catheters in the cardiovascularsystern is common<br>
practice and vessel wall injury, embolization and the following restenosis are a<br>
major concern of cardiologists during and after surgical intervention or<br>
catheterizations. Alternative methods such as endarterectomy cause comparable<br>
problems. Every procedure in which arteries are manipulated i.e. vascular<br>
surgery ancLangioplasty, is susceptibie^to the development of intimal hyperplasia.<br>
The utility of a method for preventing or decreasing the development of intimal<br>
hyperplasia can not be over emphasized, and the benefits of a method capable of<br>
doing this without producing systemic effects is even more encouraging.<br>
Therefore the nesed for new and improved pharmaceuticals and methods for<br>
inhibiting the earliest events in pathophysiology (e.g. platelet adhesion) is obvious<br>
and contributions in this field are expected to substantially decrease morbidity<br>
and mortality associated with angioplasitic or surgical procedures.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
In general, the present invention involves the introduction of the recently<br>
described platelet adhesion inhibitor Saratin into or onto a selected location within<br>
.Y-'<br>
or on a lumen in a tissue, i.e. the vasculature or an organ under conditions such<br>
that Saratin may be used locally as a topical agent or as an adherent coating on<br>
the surface to prevent and inhibit an undesirable thrombotic and/or restenotic<br>
response to vessel wall injury, including injury associated with angioplasty, stents,<br>
dialysis graftsand other vascular grafts, and the treatment of benign hypertrophic<br>
scar formation as well as the treatment and passivation of unstable<br>
atherosclerotic plaques.<br>
Saratin is a recently described (WO0056885) recombinant 12 kD, protein<br>
originally isolated from a leech. The protein inhibits vWF-dependent binding of<br>
platelets to arterial wall collagens under conditions of elevated shear and it is this<br>
aspect of the invention that makes Saratin suitable to inhibit arterial thrombosis.<br>
Another novel aspect is that Saratin can be used as a topical agent at the site of<br>
injury with the benfrt of decreasing thrombosis and or intimal hyperplasia without<br>
any systemic effects. This represents a modality with specific and localized<br>
effects well suited for application by both surgeons and interventional radiologists<br>
alike.<br>
Saratin can be combined wife a variety of therapeutic agents for on-site delivery.<br>
Examples for use in coronary-artery applications are antithrombotic agents, e.g.,<br>
prostacyclin and salicylates, thrombolytic agents, e.g., streptokinase, urokinase,<br>
tissue plasmirrogerractivator (TPA) and anisoylated plasminogen- streptokinase<br>
activator comptex (APSAC), vasodilating agents, i.e., nitrates, calcium channel<br>
blocking drugs, antF-proiiferative agents, i.e., colchicine and alkylating agents,<br>
intercalating agents, growth modulating factors such as interleukins,<br>
transformation growth factor-beta and congeners of platelet derived growth factor,<br>
monoclonal -antibodies-directed=against growth factors, anti-inflammatory agents,<br>
batrrstecoidal and non-steroidal, and-c#ier agents that can modulate vessel tone,<br>
function, arteriosclerosis, and the healing response to vessel or organ injury post<br>
intervention. Antibiotics can also be included in combinations or coatings<br>
comprised by the invention. Moreover, a coating can be used to effect<br>
pharmaceutical delivery focally within the vessel wall. By incorporation of the<br>
active agent in a swellable polymer, the active agent will be released upon<br>
swelling of the polymer.<br>
In one embodiment the coating is made from a hydro-gel, such as poly-ethylene<br>
oxide, albumin, hydrophilic poly-methacrylates and hydrophilic poly urethanes.<br>
The present invention further provides the use of Saratin and derivatives via local<br>
drug delivery devices/catheters or via stents and stent coatings and vascular<br>
grafts and graft coating technologies, for example. The invention also provides<br>
methods of administering Saratin in compositions that elute out regulated<br>
quantities of the Saratin over time in a localized area.<br>
In particular, one embodiment of the present invention relates to uses of catheter-<br>
based devices to deliver Saratin locally. Saratin may as well be applied with or<br>
without other therapeutic agents out of a polymer matrix into body tissues using<br>
catheters. The basic requirements for the polymer material to be used in the<br>
present method are biocompatibllity and drug release properties which can be<br>
adapted to the specifc application.<br>
The local controlled Saratin release may be achieved by permeation only,<br>
iontophoresis only, electroporation only, or combined iontophoresis and<br>
electroporation may be used to release and incorporate Saratin efficiently inside<br>
the vessel lumen. Preferably, the catheter is able to perform procedures designed<br>
to maintain a high concentration of drug in the selected vessel space such that<br>
the results give an improved vessel coating with Saratin alone or with additional<br>
treatment agents.<br>
The present invention is particularly applicable to the local delivery of Saratin<br>
during and after interventional cardiology procedures such as angioplasty and<br>
stent implantation and endarterectorny.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
Suitable recombinant Saratirtfor use in the iiweHtion^was expressed and isolated<br>
from Hansenuia polymorph® and was found to acts by blocking vWF binding to<br>
collagen and effectively prevents the adhesion of platelets to collagen under<br>
elevated shear. Saratin dose-dependently inhibited the binding of purified human<br>
vWF to human type I and III collagens (IC50 = 0.23 ± 0.004 and 0.81 ± 0.04 ug ml'<br>
1 respectively ) and to calf skin collagen (IC50 = 0.44 ± 0.008 ug ml-1).<br>
Furthermore, saratin showed a similar inhibitory potency against the binding of<br>
human, rodent and porcine plasma vWF to these collagens. In a flow chamber<br>
under conditions of elevated shear (2700 s"1), saratin dose-dependently and<br>
potently inhibited platelet aggregate formation on a collagen-coated surface (IC50<br>
= 0.96 ± 0.25 ug ml"1), but at reduced shear (1300 s"1) a rightward shift in the<br>
dose-response curve was noted (IC5o = 5.2 ± 1.4 ug ml"1). Surface plasmon<br>
resonance analysis revealed both high and low affinity binding sites for saratin on<br>
human collagen type III (Kd = 5 x 10"8 M and 2 x 10"6 M respectively), and<br>
although low concentrations of Saratin, that inhibited platelet adhesion under<br>
increased shear (i.e. saturation of high affinity binding sites) had no effect on<br>
vWF-independent collagen-induced platelet aggregation, high concentrations (i.e.<br>
saturation of low affinity binding sites) were found to inhibit platelet aggregation.<br>
These data demonstrate that saratin is a potent inhibitor of vWF-dependent<br>
platelet adhesion to collagen which forms the basis for the therapeutic potential<br>
as an anti-thrombotic agent.<br>
The studies further demonstrated that Saratin potently and dose-dependently<br>
inhibits the binding of vWF not only to calf skin collagen, but to human collagen<br>
types I and III, both of which are abundant in arterial wall sub-endothelial layers<br>
and believed to be important in platelet-vessel wall interactions (Thromb Haemost<br>
1997, 78(1):434-438). Since collagen-vWF-GP Ib/IX/V interactions only take<br>
place at sufficiently elevated shear, it was an important aspect of this invention to<br>
demonstrate the efficacy of saratin not only under static conditions, but also in-an<br>
environment that more closely mimics the situation encountered in vivo. In a flow<br>
chamber, where shear forces can be varied to simulate such an environment,<br>
saratin cieariy inhibited platelet accumulation to coHagen, particularly at higher<br>
shear. The rightward sfe&amp;tjof-the. dose-response curve as a result of reducing<br>
shear is nc4eworthy since the implication is that the efficacy of saratin in vivo may<br>
be localized to areas of high shear, where disruption of laminar blood flow results<br>
from changes to the endothelial surface presented to the blood, for example in<br>
the presence of aterosclerotic plaque or after mechanical intervention.<br>
Surface plasmon resonance studies with saratin revealed that collagen may<br>
possess two independent binding sites for saratin, one of high affinity and one of<br>
low affinity. Inhibition by saratin of vWF binding to collagen is explained by<br>
saturation of the high affinity binding site, with IC50 values around 5 x 10"8 M, i.e.<br>
equal to the dissociation constant for this site. Because vWF-independent<br>
collagen-induced platelet aggregation was only inhibited at very high doses of<br>
saratin, (above 100 uM), it seems that saturation of the low affinity collagen<br>
binding site is associated with inhibition of direct collagen-collagen receptor<br>
interactions.<br>
Another objective in this invention is the effect of Saratin to affect the local<br>
environment of an endarterectomized vessel without requiring systemic<br>
distribution and without altering platelet function or altering coagulation this<br>
makes it an ideal modality for topical application during vascular surgical and<br>
interventional radiological procedures.<br>
In this spect of the invention the therapeutic Saratin effect was investigated using<br>
a rat carotid endarterectomy (CEA) model described previously (J. Vase. Surg.<br>
1998, 28:909-918). PLT activation is thought to be the initiating step in post CEA<br>
thrombosis and restenosis due to IH. It has been observed, that the topical<br>
application of Saratin on the lumenal surface will decrease the amount of platelet<br>
adhesion to the endarterectomized artery and thus decrease post-op thrombosis<br>
and IH.<br>
experimental<br>
As a summary of theWeikneiital results the anti platelet adherence effect of<br>
Saratin evaluated after two different postoperative times indicated that the<br>
number of adherent platelets at 3 hours (Figure 4) and 24 hours (Figure 5) post<br>
carotid endarterectomy was significantly reduced in the rats treated with Saratin<br>
as compared to the control rats.<br>
Platelet adhesion was reduced by 59% at 3 hours (64+ 17.2 vs155 ± 33.4 PLT<br>
per grid P=0.05) and 77% at 24 hours (35 ± 11.3 vs 149 ± 36.6 PLT per grid P =.<br>
0110) PlateJet adhesion was similar at 3 hours and 24 hours in the control groups<br>
but did show a decrease in the Saratin treated group from 64 to 35 platelets per<br>
grid.<br>
Figures 6 and 7 show a typical representation of the endarterectomized surface<br>
with and without topical Saratin using scanning electron microscopy at 2000 X<br>
magnification. Figure 6 A, shows the control surface at 3 hours post carotid<br>
endarterectomy, note the marked abunda«Ee~of cellular material , fibrin strands,<br>
numerous red blood ceHs, and numerous platelets which are evident. Figure 6 B<br>
shows a Saratin treated surface 3 hours post carotid endarterectomy. Note the<br>
lack of cellular elements and the near barren collagen surface. Figure 7 A shows<br>
a control surface at 24 hours post carotid endarterectomy, platelets are evident<br>
as smalt white dots. Figure 7 B is a Saratin treated surface at 24 hours post<br>
carotid endarterectomy. There is a clear reduction in platelet adhesion with<br>
Saratin treatment<br>
The application of topical Saratin following a carotid endarterectomy significantly<br>
decreased the development of intimal hyperplasia as compared to the control<br>
group. Percent lumenal stenosis as a measure of IH was significantly decreased<br>
with Saratin application compared to controls This decrease in IH formation<br>
correlated with the inhibition of PLT adherence. In terms of lumenal stenosis,<br>
control rats showed a 29.8 ±6.8%, p=0.0042 lumenal stenosis vs. a 10.9 ± 1.8%<br>
lumenal stenosis in the Saratin treated group (Figure 6 ). Saratin treated rats had<br>
18.9% greater lumenal diameter than control rats. At two weeks post carotid<br>
endarterectomy, 5 of the 15 control rats (15%) developed complete thrombus of<br>
the carotid artery on histological analysis while 0 of 15 Saratin treated rats (0%)<br>
developed carotid thrombosis. A likelihood ratio Chi Square analysis revealed an<br>
odds ratio of 16.238 which suggests that the odds of the control group developing<br>
occlusive thrombosis was 16 times greater than the rats treated with Saratin P =<br>
0.0156.<br>
No increased bleeding was encountered aJong the arterial suture line in the<br>
Saratin group. Bleeding times and systemic platelet counts were not found to<br>
change significantly in the Saratin treated rats as compared to control rats at 3<br>
and 24 hours post endarterectomy.<br>
The CEA model closely resembtes the human CEA operation and hence the<br>
results propose a mechanism for decreasing the deleterious effects of platelet<br>
adherence and aggregation at the endarterectomy site without affecting platelet<br>
function systemicaHy or decreasing bemostasis. The simple, topical application of<br>
Saratin during a rat CEA decreases platelet adherence, aggregation and<br>
subsequent restenosis in tbexatr-oUdijed due to intimal hyperplasia.<br>
Table 3 shows the results of the bleeding times and platelet counts. No<br>
statistically significant differences weFe observed between pre-op and post-op<br>
bleeding times. No stafisticaBy significant difference was- identified in the platelet<br>
courrbdffierjences between the Saratin and control rats.<br>
We have shown a significant decrease in platelet adhesion and accumulation<br>
after a vascular injury similar to endarterectomy. The decreased platelet adhesion<br>
is seen both immediately after endarterectomy (3 hours) as well as at 24 hours.<br>
The effect at 24 hours is significant in that we believe this effect is not due to the<br>
direct inhibitory effect of Saratin on the collagen (the serum half life of Saratin is<br>
90 minutes), rather it is due to the initial inhibition of platelet aggregation and the<br>
subsequent disruption of the platelet activation cascade. Once platelets are<br>
initially inhibited from attaching to exposed collagen, the platelet cascade can not<br>
proceed. Figures 4 and 5 demonstrate that the topical application of Saratin on<br>
the recently injured vessel can inhibit platelet adhesion to a significant degree.<br>
Saratin inhibited platelet adhesion by 60% and 75% at 3 and 24 hours<br>
respectively. This inhibition is noted in the visible differences in cellular element<br>
deposition between control and Saratin treated arteries at both 3 hours and 24<br>
hours (Figures 7 and 8). This lack of cellular response we propose is due to the<br>
inhibition of platelet adhesion. This represents a unique mode of therapy for the<br>
inhibition of platelet adhesion to an injured vessel. Control rats had a significantly<br>
reduced lumenal diameter at 2 weeks post carotid endarterectomy compared to<br>
Saratin treated rats (Figure 9). The amount of intimal hyperplasia development<br>
was significantly reduced in Saratin treated rats, which correlated with reduced<br>
platelet adhesion and accumulation. The finding of decreased intimal hyperplasia<br>
and thrombosis that are associated with decreased platelet adhesion provide for<br>
clinically relevant endpoints and sequala of reduced platelet adhesion This<br>
demonstrated that the site specific non systemic inhibition of platelet aggregation<br>
and adhesion leads to a decreased thrombosis and occlusion rate and hence<br>
reduces the incidence of post carotid endarterectomy related cerebrovascular<br>
events. The level of intimal hyperplasia and lumenal stenosis improvement is<br>
further demonstrated by the significant finding of a decreased thrombosis rate in<br>
rats treated with Saratin. A full 33% of control rate showed thrombosis whereas<br>
none of the Saratin treated carotid arteries were thrombosed. Of particular clinical<br>
importance is the lack of systemic effects demonstrated by this agent. The local<br>
application of Saratin did not affect systemic Weeding times or platelet counts.<br>
Thisr implies that the decreased pJateJeLadheston andntbe subsequent decrease<br>
in thrombosis and intimal hyperplasia ace the result of local effects. These new<br>
findings related to Saratin are certainly important in that the-spectrum of clinical<br>
applications for a modality that is capable of locaHy inhibiting the deleterious<br>
effects of platelet adhesion and activation without disturbing the systemic<br>
hemostatic mechanism, are many.<br>
It has been pointed out earlier that various therapeutic interventions induce local<br>
injuries which would ideally be treated immediately and locally.Left untreated the<br>
injured cells initiate a series of processes involved in clotting, complement<br>
activation, and cellular response to release of cytokines, induction of proliferation,<br>
and other biologically active processes. It is difficult to stop these complex,<br>
interrelated processes once they have begun.<br>
In the present invention it is therefore an important aspect that Saratin is located<br>
directly in the manipulated tissues. Another aspect of the local application is the<br>
minimization of potential problems related to the systemic effects of the drugs<br>
used for intervention.<br>
Idealy Saratin treatment may be administered simultaneously with the appropriate<br>
therapeutic intervention which may be achieved by incorporating Saratin into the<br>
coating of a surgical device such as a ballon catheter or another device or part<br>
thereof. Another aspect could also involve the direct coating of the injured vessels<br>
with Saratin.<br>
Additionally, normal Saratin delivery means may be used in the invention as well,<br>
such as free fluid form, including combinations with other therapeutic agents.<br>
However, use of poh/mer/hydrogel matrices has certain advantages over free<br>
fluid delivery. Delivery of an agent which has been incorporated into a polymer<br>
matrix does not require additional lumens in the support catheter to convey the<br>
free fluid drug solution into and out of the treatment site.<br>
Additionally, the polymer matrices eliminate the risk of downstream leakage of<br>
drug solution due to defective balloon sealing of vessel segments, thereby<br>
avoiding the risk of exposure of non-target tissue to high concentrations of the<br>
drug.<br>
A general technical solution to the local application of Saratin either on a medical<br>
device or as a coating to the injured, vessel is for example the incorporation of<br>
Saratin into a polymer or hydrogel coating.<br>
With respect to the polymer composition, the term "hydrogeF as used herein<br>
includes synthetic polymers with pores or interstices of different sizes and<br>
capacities and varying physicochemical properties especially with respect to the<br>
charge or the hydmphific/hvjiBophobic nature of the gel matrix which may be<br>
introduced during manufacture- of-the coating or coated device. A variety of<br>
synthetic elastomers and naturally occurring polymeric materials are known to<br>
those skilled in the art. Saratin can be incorporated in the matrix either during<br>
polymer production or added after coating or molding of the polymer into the<br>
desired shape. Additionally, many of a number of different polymeric materials<br>
and methods of fabrication may be used to form the polymer matrices used in the<br>
present invention. Examples of suitable polymer materials or combinations<br>
include, but are not limited to, biocompatible and/or biodegradable polymers.<br>
Several alkyl alkyl- and cyanoacrylates have been investigated for surgical use<br>
and some isobutyl cyanoacrylates have been found especially suitable.<br>
A typical hydrogel polymer may be produced from a monomer mixture<br>
comprising 40-60 parts by weight of a purified monoester of a hydroxyalkyl alkyl<br>
acrylate having a single olefinic double bond, 40-60 parts by weight of a<br>
methacrylic monomer containing one olefinic double bond, and 0.001-5 parts by<br>
weight of a polymerization initiator. Polymerization may be accomplished by the<br>
conventional techniques of bulk polymerization, solution polymerization,<br>
suspension polymerization or emulsion polymerization. The polymerization<br>
technique used is dependent upon the volume of polymer required and the nature<br>
of the final product being produced. A typical hydrogel product would be<br>
described by a molar ratio of monoester to methacrylic monomer within the range<br>
of 1:1 to 2.3:1, preferably 1.5:1, wherein the pore diameter of the polymer is<br>
greater than 90 Angstroms.<br>
As the monoester of a hydroxyalkyl acrylate having a single olefinic double bond,<br>
acceptable compounds include, but are not limited to, 2-hydroxyethyl<br>
methacrylate, glyceryl methacrylate, 2-hydroxypropyl methacrylate, glycidyl<br>
methacrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate, and 2-hydroxypropyl acrylate. Acceptable<br>
methacrylic monomers are methacrylic acid, methacrylamide 5 and<br>
methacrylonitrile.<br>
The polymerization initiator may depend on the method of polymerization or the<br>
final intended use of the polymer. For example, where the polymer is to be<br>
formed as a soM object, free radical initiators may be used.<br>
Preferred initiators of that type include difunctional polyesters such as 2,5-<br>
Dimethyl-2,5-bis(2ethylhexoylperoxy)hexane, or tertiarybutyl peroxypivHate.<br>
Afterrratfvely, where the ultimate use of the polymer is as a coating applied in the<br>
form of the monomer mixture and polymerized in situ, the initiator may be<br>
radiation activated such as UV catalysts 2,2Azobis(2-methylpropionitrile) or<br>
azobisbutyronitrile (AIBN). The initiators are not restricted to use in a particular<br>
polymerization method or for a particular final product. For example, the free<br>
radical initiators may be employed in coatings and the radiation activated<br>
initiators may be employed in the formation of solid articles.<br>
In addition to the substantially similar fractions of the monoester and methacrylic<br>
monomer, the monomer mixture may be enhanced with trace amounts of a longer<br>
chain alkyl acrylate or methacrylate ester comdnomer such as cyclohexyl<br>
methacrylate, trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate or ethyleneglycol<br>
dimethacrylate. Such additional comonomers enhance the polymer crosslinking<br>
for situations where added polymer strength is desired. The trace amounts of<br>
these comonomers are generally less than 0.1% by weight of the total monomer<br>
mixture.<br>
The hydrogel polymers used in the present invention may be formed to produce<br>
an article which is sufficiently crosslinked by intrinsic action that the resulting<br>
article requires no additional crosslinking monomers.<br>
Additional examples for biodegradable polymers are poly(lactides),<br>
polyglycolides, polyanhydrides, polyorthoesters, polyactals, polydihydropyrans,<br>
polycyanoacrylates and copolymers of these and polyethylene glycol. These can<br>
take the form of co-polymer hydrogels or cross-linked polymer networks into<br>
which drugs for enhanced local delivery can be incorporated either during<br>
polymerization or, in the case of certain hydrogels, loaded subsequently.<br>
Preferable matrices would be tailored according to the molecular characteristics<br>
of the agent to control free diffusion outwards.<br>
Multiple types of catheters and other medical devices coated with Saratin may be<br>
constructed and used according to the individual therapeutic need they have<br>
been designed for, or for the more specific purpose of delivering the Saratin<br>
loaded polymer locally: The present invention has been tested with the ballon<br>
catheter sold under the name Biue medical Devices BV GO available from Blue<br>
medical but is not limited to this type of catheter.<br>
Further examples<br>
Example 1<br>
Purified vWF and platelet binding to collagen under static conditions<br>
vWF binding to collagen was investigated in microtiter plates, essentially as<br>
described elsewhere (Blood 1995, 85(3):705-711). Various collagens, either<br>
human collagen type I, type 111, or calf skin collagen (Sigma) were coated<br>
overnight by pipeting 50 ul of collagen, dissolved in 50 mM acetic acid at 125 ug<br>
ml"1 in 96-well microtiter plates in the presence of 200 ul PBS, to promote<br>
renaturation. Following blocking non-coated sites with BSA, purified human vWF<br>
(1.25 ug ml"1 for calfskin and collagen I coated plates; 0.625 ug ml"1 for collagen<br>
III coated plates) or diluted normal plasma (human plasma: 1/80 on collagen I<br>
and III, 1/40 on calfskin collagen; hamster, mouse and porcine plasma: 1/80 on<br>
collagen III; 1/20 on collagen I and calf skin collagen) was added to the wells in<br>
the presence of Saratin and incubated for 2 hours (diluted plasma) or 1 hour<br>
(purified vWF). Binding of residual vWF to collagen was determined after a further<br>
washing step using rabbit anti-vWF antiserum (Dako, Copenhagen, Denmark)<br>
conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, which was developed and the resulting<br>
light absorbance measured at 492 nm.<br>
When microtiter plates were pre-incubated with either human collagen I, human<br>
collagen III or calf skin collagen, the subsequent incubation of purified vWF in the<br>
presence of saratin was associated with a dose-dependent inhibition in vWF-<br>
collagen binding, with IC50 values of 0.23 ± 0.004, 0.81 ± 0.04 and 0.44 ± 0.008<br>
ug ml"1 respectively (Figure 1). When purified vWF was replaced by diluted<br>
normal human plasma the inhibitory potency of saratin was maintained (Table 1).<br>
Saratin also inhibited the binding of vWF in diluted porcine, hamster and murine<br>
plasma to the different collagens tested, with consistently highest efficacy against<br>
collagen I (Table 1).<br>
Example 2<br>
Platelet adhesion under-elevated shear<br>
In view of the importance of shear forces in the control of vWF-dependent platelet<br>
adhesion to collagen (J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1974, 83(2):296-3O0), flow chamber<br>
perfusion studies were performed to examine the tahibiloiy acliorrof saratin under<br>
similar flow conditions to those encountered in injured or diseased arteries. Caif<br>
skin collagen was coated on to plastic coverslips as previously described (Blood<br>
1995, 85
chamber witfi two coversiip holders, and chamber heights of 0.4, 0.6 or 1.0 mm<br>
and a width of 1.0 cm, under pulsatile flow (rofler pump, Watson Marlow 6J03S,<br>
VEL, Leuven, Belgium) at approximate shear rates of 2700, 1300 and 300 s"1<br>
respectively. Anticoagulated whole blood (0.2 IU ml"1 low molecular weight<br>
heparin, Clexane) was perfused over the collagen-coated coverslips for 5 min,<br>
after which the rinsed coverslips were stained with GrQnwald-Giemsa and<br>
assessed for platelet deposition by light microscopy and image analysis as<br>
described (Blood 1995, 85(3):705-711), using surface coverage as a quantitative<br>
parameter.<br>
At a shear rate of 2700 s"\ saratin dose-dependently inhibited platelet adhesion,<br>
with an IC50 = 0.96 ± 0.25 ug ml"1 (Figure 2). However, at a more moderate shear<br>
rate of 1300 s"\ a distinct rightward shift in the dose-response curve was<br>
observed, with an IC50 = 5.2 ±1.4 pg ml*1 (Figure 2). At venous shear rates of<br>
300 s"\ saratin was unable to inhibit the adhesion of perfused platelets up to 10<br>
ug ml"1 (data not shown).<br>
"Example 3<br>
Binding Analysis by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)<br>
Protein interactions were identified and characterized by SPR using a BIAcore<br>
3000 instrument (BIAcore, Freiburg, Germany). Coupling reagents were used<br>
according to protocols developed by the supplier. Coupling to the CM 5 sensor<br>
chip was done via activated carboxyfate groups to free amine groups of human<br>
collagen type III (Sigma). The pH-scouting and the coupling chemistry was<br>
performed under standard conditions (Anal Bfochem. 1991, 198(2):268-277, JAI<br>
Press Ltd., 1992). For coupling the collagen was diluted to 0.125 ug ml"1 into 10<br>
mM acetate buffer (pH 4.5), resulting in 331 resonance units (RU) immobilized<br>
material. This matrix was used to study the binding of purified recombinant<br>
saratin which was diluted into 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCI, 5 mM<br>
EDTA, 0.005% Tween 20. AH binding experiments were performed at 25°C.<br>
Titrations with Saratin were performed at concenfrations ranging from 7.8 nM to<br>
10 uM . The resulting experimental RU plateau_values were plotted according to<br>
the equation:<br>
Req/saratin concentration = (-K/vX Req) + (KAx R^a).<br>
Titration of saratin onto the immobilized collagen surface resulted in<br>
concentration-dependent binding: Farther., the maximal amoant~of sajafin bound<br>
to collagen on the sensor surface resulted in a signal greater than the cafcutated<br>
maximum signal for a 1:1 binding model. This points towards the existence of<br>
more than one binding site for saratin on collagen type III, further substantiated<br>
by the observation that fitting of the data to a 1:1 binding model according to<br>
Langmuir gave no satisfactory results.<br>
Scatchard analysis of the SPR data indicated the existence of two different<br>
binding sites with significantly different affinities for saratin (Figure 3). Calculation<br>
of the equilibrium constants resulted in a dissociation constant of 5 x 10'8 M for<br>
the high affinity site and 2 x 10"6 M for the low affinity binding site.<br>
Example 4<br>
Platelet aggregation<br>
The specificity of saratin on platelet function was further evaluated via<br>
aggregation studies in platelet-rich plasma using collagen, ADP, ristocetin,<br>
arachidonic add or the thromboxane mimetic U46619 as agonists. Citrated blood<br>
(3.13%) from unmedicated, healthy volunteers was centrifuged (15 min, 100g) to<br>
obtain platelet-rich plasma, to which saratin was added (final concentration 0-200<br>
ug ml"1) for 1 rrrtn prior to induction of platelet aggregation with collagen (0.5 ug<br>
ml"1), ADP (2.5 uM), ristocetin (0.9 mg ml"1), arachidonic acid (1.0 mM) or U46619<br>
(1.3 uM). The maximum aggregation (amplitude) over a 5 min period was<br>
observed for each agonist<br>
Saratin failed to inhibit maximal aggregation to all agonists tested, including<br>
collagen, at end concentrations up to 40 ug ml"1 (Table 2). Saratin was, however,<br>
able to partially inhibit collagen-induced platelet aggregation at 100 ug ml"1 (not<br>
shown), with complete inhibition at 200 ug ml"1, although aggregation to ADP was<br>
unaffected, even at 200 ug ml"1 saratin.<br>
Example 5<br>
Rat CEA model<br>
A rat CEA model that employed an open technique with arteriotomy, direct<br>
removal of intana and portions of media and suture closure of the artery was<br>
used. One group of rats received Saratin white the other group served as<br>
controls. Endpoint measurements included, 1) PLT adhesion, 2) Thrombosis<br>
rate, 3) Intimal hyperplasia development. Saratin was applied directly to the<br>
endaraterectomized surface of the carotid artery prior to arterial closure. Electron<br>
micrographs (2000 X mag) of prepared carotid arteries were used for quantitative<br>
analysis of PLT aggregation. Total PLT numbers were counted using a<br><br>
standardized overlay grid. IH and thrombosis were assessed by computer<br>
assisted morphometric analysis of elastin stained carotid artery sections with<br>
direct measurement of IH area.<br>
Example 6<br>
Carotid endarterectomy operation<br>
Animals were sedated with isoflurane in a bell jar, weighed, and then<br>
anesthetized with a combination of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and acepromazine<br>
maleate (1 mg/kg) intraperitoneally. After adequate anesthesia was confirmed with<br>
lack of response to hind paw stimulation, 4 cc of normal saline was injected<br>
subcutaneously in the region of the upper middle back to serve as a fluid bolus<br>
(10cc/kg) to compensate for any intra-operative blood loss. The neck area was<br>
then shaved and preped with 7% isopropyl alcohol. Using sterile technique and a<br>
dissecting microscope (x 40,sz40 Olympus, Olympus America Inc., Melville, NY)<br>
a midline cervical incision was made. The superficial muscles were divided and<br>
the dissection carried down to the level of the right carotid artery. The cervical<br>
nerves in the region of the artery were dissected free to preserve pharyngeal<br>
function and prevent post-operative respiratory compromise.<br>
After adequate carotid artery exposure, proximal and distal control at the<br>
bifurcation, approximately 1.5-cm apart, was obtained using 3-0 silk suture<br>
tourniquets. Using a corneal blade an arteriotomy was made and extended to<br>
6mm in length with micro- scissors. Using a 27-gauge needle, the intima was<br>
transversely scored across the vessel in two parallel lines, approximately 2mm<br>
apart. The intima and medial layer were removed with micro- forceps. Saratin<br>
group rats received 5ul Saratin solution applied directly to the endarterectomizad<br>
surface. The arteriotomy was closed with a running 10-0 monofilament nylon<br>
suture (MS/9, Ethilon, Ethicon Inc., Somerville, NJ) beginning at the distal end.<br>
The distal tourniquet was removed first" to assess for suture line hemostasis<br>
followed by removal of the proximal tourniquet Time of Saratin application was 5<br>
minutes, which represented the time of arteriotomy closure. Any suture line<br>
bleeding was gently tamponaded with a sterile cotton tip applicator until<br>
hemostasis was achieved. The endarterectomized carotid artery was assessed<br>
with a hand held Doppler to confirm patency. The superficial muscle layer and<br>
skin were then closed with a running 3-0 absorbable suture.<br>
Example 7<br>
Platelet adhesion<br>
In the platelet adhesion subgroups, the rats were re anesthetized and the<br>
endarterectomized carotid arteries were harvested and fixed in a 4%<br>
glutaldehyde solution at 3 hours or 24 hours post carotid endarterectomy. During<br>
the harvesting procedure, the carotid segments were opened longitudinally along<br>
the site of the suture closure therefore exposing the endarterectomized area. The<br>
arteries were then postfixed with osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in a graded<br>
alcohol series, critical point dried with C02 (1072 psi and 31.1°C), coated with<br>
gold palladium, and placed in the scanning electron microscope (JEOL JSM<br>
5410, JEOL, USA Peabody, MA). The endarterectomized areas were scanned at<br>
2000 X magnification and photographic images were obtained. The photographic<br>
images were matched and arranged in a collage allowing visualization of a<br>
greater area than was possible with a single field of the scanning electron<br>
microscope monitor. Once the collage of photographs was assembled, it was<br>
covered with a transparent overlay grid. The same overlay grid was used for all<br>
specimen photographs, 116 squares were used to count the total number of<br>
platelets in each photograph. The number 116 is the maximum number of<br>
squares that could be consistently counted on all of the photograph collages.<br>
Platelet counts were performed by two blinded observers..<br>
Example 8<br>
irrthrrai hyperplasia<br>
At two weeks post carotid endarterectomy, rats in the intimal hyperplasia group<br>
were anesthetized and the endarterectomized carotid artery exposed. The<br>
abdomen was opened in the midline and the distal aorta and inferior vena cava<br>
exposed The vena cava was transected and the distal aorta cannulated with a<br>
20-^gafage calhelei to rnfixse norraaJ safee at 1O0 mm Hg until the vena cava<br>
effluent ran clear. Next, 10% buffered formalin was infused-at 100 mm Hg in an<br>
equal volume to complete the perfusion-fixation technique. A one-centimeter<br>
section of the operated carotid artery was dissected free and placed in 10%<br>
formalin until further processing for histology. The arteries were paraffin blocked,<br>
sectioned, and elastin stained with Verhoeffs and Van Gieson's stain. Multiple<br>
sections were taken at intervals of 3 micrometers each continuing along the<br><br>
distance of the continuous 10-0 nylon suture arteriotomy closure to standardize<br>
the region of sectioning. The elastin-stained slides were photographed using a<br>
KODAK DC 120 Zoom digital camera (Eastman KODAK Company, Rochester,<br>
NY). Any thrombosed sections were noted at this time. Non thrombosed images<br>
were downloaded into a computer and the lumenal areas of the carotids were<br>
analyzed using the National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD),lmageJ Software<br>
program, Version 0.99i. This software package allowed us to delineate the inner<br>
area of the intimal hyperplasia and thus obtain an accurate measure of the cross-<br>
sectional area of the vessel lumen. Also, the outer area of intimal hyperplasia was<br>
determined. The difference between the two areas (outer area of intimal<br>
hyperplasia minus the actual lumen) was determined as the absolute area of<br>
intimal hyperplasia. Because the arterial cross section had individual variations<br>
of shape, the values were expressed as a ratio of the absolute area of intimal<br>
hyperplasia to the outer limit of intimal hyperplasia, and was reported as a<br>
percent lumen stenosis. This ratio represents the proportion of the lumen area<br>
occupied by intimal hyperplasia and allowed for comparison of the arterial cross<br>
sections of varying size(4). Minimal variability was seen between measurements<br>
with two blinded observers.<br>
Example 9<br>
Bleeding times-and platelet counts<br>
In order to evaluate the effects of Saratin on systemic platelet counts and<br>
bleeding times, the platelet counts and bleeding times of 12 rats were<br>
determined. If it was necessary to obtain a preoperative blood sample from each<br>
rat of approximately 1-1.5cc's, which represents a significant portion of a rats total<br>
blood volume. In view of this, it is reasonable to expect a decrease in the post<br>
operative platelet counts of-both control and Saratin rats. In order to assess the<br>
effects of Saratin of platelet counts, we determined the difference in platelet<br>
counts for each rat by subtracting the preoperative platelet count from the<br>
postoperative platelet count to obtain a difference scone. Differences in platelet<br>
ceunis-were analyzed using a 2_X 2 factorial arrangement of treatments ANOVA<br>
model, which demonstrated no statistical significance in the platelet count<br>
differences between control and Saratin treated rats. All rats had their platelet<br>
counts and bleeding times determined preoperative^. Six rats underwent a<br>
carotid endarterectomy and were harvested 3 hours post op with bleeding times<br>
and platelet counts measured, and the remaining 6 rats were harvested 24 hours<br>
post op with bleeding times and platelet counts measured. Three of the rats in<br>
each time group received topical Saratin, and the remaining 3 rats served as<br>
controls.<br>
Bleeding times were determined by transecting the distal 2 mm of the rat's tail<br>
and submerging approximately 4 em's of the tail into a solution of phosphate<br>
buffered solution at 37°C. The amount of time elapsed from tail transection to<br>
cessation of bleeding was measured and was assigned as the bleeding time.<br>
Platelet counts were determined by drawing a 1-1.5cc sample of blood from the<br>
internal jugular vein which was analyzed in a Coulter STKS blood analyzer and<br>
the results were expressed x 103.<br>
Example 10<br>
Statistical methods<br>
Means ± standard errors are reported. Unpaired t-test analysis were performed<br>
using the Stat View program (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC 27513) version 5.0 to<br>
compare Saratin treated and control groups for numbers of adherent platelets,<br>
percent lumenai stenosis and bleeding times. A likelihood ratio Chi Square<br>
analysis was used to evaluate the odds ratio for development of thrombosis two<br>
weeks post carotid endarterectomy. A 2 X 2 factorial arrangement of treatments<br>
ANOVA model was used to evaluate the differences between preoperative and<br>
postoperative platelet counts.<br>
Example 11<br>
Experimental animals<br>
Sprague-Dawley rats (350 - 400g) were organized into carotid endarterectomy<br>
groups based on two mairr objects. 1) Evaluation of platelet adhesion and 2)<br>
Evaluation of lumen stenosis due to intimal hyperplasia, and thrombosis rate.<br>
Within these two objectives, rats were divided into control ancLSacatin treated<br>
animals. All rats underwent a-carotid endarterectomy (see below), Saratin treated<br>
rats received a topical application of 5ul solution of Saratin on the lumenai<br>
surface of the carotid artery immediately after removal of the intimaVmedia layer.<br>
The platelet adhesion group consisted of electron microscopy evaluation at 3<br>
hours post carotid endarterectomy (n = 17) and 24 hours post carotid<br>
endarterectomy (n = 19). The intimal hyperplasia group (n = 25) were harvested<br>
two weeks post carotid endarterectomy.<br><br>
Example 12<br>
Preparation of Saratin coated hydrogel catheter<br>
Surfaces of PA-12 based materials have been activated by emersing the devices<br>
in a solution of 2 mol-% macro-initiator (poly(octadecen-alt-malein acetic acid<br>
anhydrid) with a per-ester (11-16 mol-%) dissolved in isopropanol and 0,5 mol<br>
ethylenglykol-dimethacrylat (EGDMA) /1 mol macro-initiator. After drying the<br>
macro-initiator-/EGDMA coating. The coating has been annealed another 5 bis<br>
10 min at 120 °C which helped to improve fixation of the macro-initiator to the<br>
surface thus improving crosslinking.<br>
For optimising coating conditions hydrogel coatings generated on a PA-12 carrier<br>
sheet have been used. Prior to coating, the sheets have been washed with iso-<br>
propanol or aceton and dried.<br>
Ballon catheter type Blue Medical Devises GO (RX PTCA catheter) consiting of<br>
Vestamid (PA-12) have been used for coating with hydrogel. Aqueous solutions<br>
of 5 mol-% acrylic acid 100ml and 0,2 bis 0,8 mol-% methylen-bis-acrylic have<br>
been mixed and used to coat sheets or catheters. After polymerisation the<br>
coated device has been washed with water and for another 24 hrs in PBS buffer.<br>
Following this, the polymer is annealed in the oven at 60-80°C for 0,5 to 3 hours.<br>
Thickness of dried hydrogel coatings was in a range of 1 to 4 um, the swelling of<br>
hydrogel in aqueous solution ranged from 10 to 50 g hydrogel wet / 1g hydrogel<br>
dry.<br>
When immersed (30 min) in a buffered PBS buffer pH 7,4 solution of Saratin a<br>
concentration of 50 ngml has been used.<br>
Organic solvents have been used to prepare the coating solutions when sprayed<br>
on a ballon catheter using standard small scale spray coating equipment like that<br>
available from EFD.<br>
