				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a roller device for a movable point of frog, comprising a<br>
sliding strip and at least one roller and at least one roller bearing fixed to a<br>
stationary part of a switch.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
A device of this type is, for instance, known from WO 94/26976 Al. In that<br>
known roller device, an element comprising a projection extending along, or<br>
approximately along, the central axis of the point of frog departs directly or<br>
indirectly from the point of frog on the side of the foot, wherein said element<br>
interacts with a roller element whose central axis extends in, or approximately in,<br>
a symmetrical plane extending between the wing rail. In that known device, the<br>
roller guide on which the roller rolls off is, thus, directly or indirectly connected<br>
with the point of frog, whereby the respective roller is supported by a structure<br>
fixed to the side rails. The roller device known from WO 94/26976 Al serves to<br>
support the point of frog at a switching movement from one abutment position<br>
into the other. In order to cause the point of frog to be lifted from the slide chair<br>
during such switching movement, the roller guide in that case comprises two<br>
outer, concavely extending portions and a central, preferably plateau-shaped<br>
portion on its surface facing the roller. On the roller guide connected with the<br>
point of frog, a guide track is thus provided, which is configured in a manner that<br>
the point of frog is lifted from the slide chair as the guide track slides over the<br>
roller element.<br>
Similar roller devices have also become known for tongue rails, wherein a roller<br>
device in which the roller cooperates with spring elements may, for instance, be<br>
taken from WO 94/02682 Al. It has, however, turned out that the known roller<br>
devices are not readily suitable for the subsequent installation into existing track<br>
systems.<br>
For the purpose of creating a roller device for a movable point of frog, which can<br>
be readily installed into an existing system even subsequently without involving<br>
any cumbersome adaptation or adjustment work at the existing rails and, in<br>
particular, the point of frog and wing rails or side rails, it was proposed in the<br>
earlier application A 1429/2001 to mount the roller in a roller holder connected<br>
with the point of frog and to connect the roller guide with the wing rails and, in<br>
particular, the rail foot, or with the ground plate. By such a proposal the<br>
subsequent mounting of the roller device was substantially facilitated due to the<br>
fact that, unlike in known configurations, the roller holder was directly connected<br>
with the point of frog and the roller was thus attached to the point of frog.<br>
"US 5501418 describes a switch point roller assist apparatus including an<br>
elongated main support structure on which is movably mounted a rail<br>
securement clamp for releasably adjustably connecting the main support<br>
structure to a railroad rail. An elongated tie bar is adjustably mounted on the<br>
main support structure generally perpendicular to the main support structure<br>
generally perpendicular to the main support structure. A roller support cage is<br>
pivotally adjustably mounted on the main support structure, the roller support<br>
cage supporting at least one roller rotatably mounted thereon, each roller<br>
mounted generally perpendicular to the main support structure. The tie bar is<br>
adjustably mounted to the main support structure such that the position of the<br>
tie bar is vertically adjustable relative to the main support structure. Finally, the<br>
roller support cage is adjustably mounted on the main support structure such<br>
that the position of the rollers is vertically adjustable relative to the main support<br>
structure. There is no indication in US 5501418 to mount rollers onto an arm of a<br>
doubled arm lever."<br>
Yet, any fine-tuning is still relatively expensive, calling for a huge number of<br>
precisely adapted structural components. In particular, it is not readily feasible in<br>
that earlier configuration to realize an appropriate resilient support in a simple<br>
manner.<br>
OBJECT OF INVENTION<br>
The present inventions aims to further simplify the installation of a roller device<br>
for a movable point of frog and, at the same time, render feasible the provision<br>
of an appropriate support of the point of frog on several points along the axial<br>
lengths of the point of frog with a minimum of adjustment work and, in<br>
particular, by using identical spring elements.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
To solve this object, the configuration according to the invention consists<br>
essentially in that the roller(s) is/are mounted on an arm of a double-armed<br>
lever, that the pivot bearing of the lever is arranged in a support connected with<br>
a stationary part of the switch, and that the arm facing away from the roller(s),<br>
of the double-armed lever is pivotable against a spring with adjustable spring<br>
power. Due to the fact that the rollers are mounted on an arm of a double-<br>
armed lever with the pivot bearing of the lever being arranged in a support<br>
connected with a stationary part of the switch, it is feasible in a particularly<br>
simple manner to subsequently simply fix the respective support in order to<br>
simply insert the double-armed lever laterally, thus substantially facilitating its<br>
installation. Due to the fact that the arm facing away from the roller or rollers, of<br>
the double-armed lever is pivotable against a spring with adjustable spring<br>
power, it is feasible in a simple manner to define the desired spring power, the<br>
adjustability of the spring power being readily feasible without impediment<br>
outside the region of the movable point of frog. If, as in accordance with a<br>
preferred embodiment of the roller device according to the invention, the<br>
configuration is devised such that the lever arm ratio of the double-armed levers<br>
of a switch is each selected to be identical and the respectively shorter lever arm<br>
carries the roller(s), it will consequently be feasible for roller devices neighboring<br>
in the longitudinal direction of the frog to employ identical spring elements, with<br>
the identical setting force being each applicable to adjust said spring force. It is,<br>
therefore, not necessary to define different spring elements as a function of the<br>
installation situation, and the same setting paths and same setting forces will<br>
each be used in any installation position. In this manner, particularly simple<br>
adjustment and hence particularly safe subsequent mounting will be ensured in<br>
the event of subsequent mounting.<br>
As already mentioned, the fixation of the support in a particularly simple manner<br>
may be effected to the supporting structure for the movable point of frog outside<br>
the region of the wing rails. The configuration in this respect in a particularly<br>
advantageous manner is devised such that the support is fixed to the wing rails<br>
or the supporting structure of the switch, and that the adjustment device for the<br>
spring in top view is arranged outside the wing rails or the supporting structure,<br>
respectively, wherein the pivot bearing of the lever is provided in a substantially<br>
U-shaped support and, in particular, in or on the side cheeks of said support.<br>
Such a support which is substantially U-shaped in cross section and whose side<br>
cheeks carry the pivot bearings of the lever allows for the insertion of the<br>
double-armed lever in the longitudinal direction of the U-shaped support, and<br>
hence transverse to the longitudinal direction of the rails, and the pivotal fixation<br>
of the same in its respective position in a particularly simple manner. For fine<br>
tuning it will, thus, be sufficient to position the pivotable lever accordingly and,<br>
after this, adjust the spring to the value that will be identical for all positions, as<br>
a function of the lever ratio. In this respect, the configuration may<br>
advantageously be devised such that the lever arm ratio is 2:3 to 1:3, preferably<br>
1:2, so that relatively small-structured springs will do.<br>
In order to enable the selection of an accordingly favorable position for the<br>
spring with adjustable spring force irrespective of the respective installation<br>
situation of the support, it is feasible to design the double-armed levers each<br>
having the same lever arm ratio differently for different installation conditions. In<br>
that case, it may be of particular advantage to devise the configuration in a<br>
manner that the lever arm is designed to be cranked, whereby the individual<br>
roller devices as a function of the structural length of the movable points of frog<br>
may be designed to be substantially identical in terms of structure except for the<br>
lever length. The adjustment device required for the adjustment of the spring<br>
force may each be positioned where particularly easy handling is provided.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
In the following, the invention wilt be explained in more detail by way of an<br>
exemplary embodiment schematically illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
Therein,<br>
Figure 1 is a ground plan of a switch portion including a movable point of frog;<br>
Figure 2 is a section along line II/II of Figure 1; and<br>
Figure 3 is a section along line III/III of Figure 1.<br>
DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF<br>
THE INVENTION<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a frog with a point of frog 1 as well as wing rails 2 and 3.<br>
Furthermore, a ground plate 4 including a reinforcement frame 5 and the two<br>
locking arrangements 24 and 25 are apparent. The roller devices according to<br>
the invention are denoted by 6 and 7, respectively, wherein, as is apparent from<br>
the views according to Figure 2 and Figure 3, the roller device 7 is fixed to the<br>
wing rails 2 and 3 by the aid of a supporting structure and the roller device 6 is<br>
fixed to the ground plate 4 after the runout of the wing rails.<br>
Figure 2 depicts the roller device 7, wherein the point of frog 1 is in abutment on<br>
the wing rail 3 and a slide strip 8 is connected with the foot of the point of frog<br>
1, said slide strip 8 cooperating with a roller 11 mounted on an arm 9 of a<br>
double-armed lever 10. The double-armed lever 10, by means of a pivot bearing<br>
12, is pivotally mounted in a stationary U-shaped support 13 which is clamped to<br>
the wing rails 2 and 3 via brackets 14 and 15 as well as the clamping elements<br>
16 and screw bolts 17. The arm 18 facing away from the roller 11, of the double-<br>
armed lever 10 is mounted so as to be pivotable against the spring 19, the<br>
spring force of the spring 19 being adaptable to the respective requirements by<br>
the aid of an adjustment bolt 20.<br>
Departing from the position of the point of frog 1 illustrated in the drawing, in<br>
which the point of frog 1 abuts on the wing rail 3 and the point of frog 1 abuts<br>
on the roller 11 via the smaller-height portion of the slide strip 8, the point of<br>
frog 1 is lifted from the bearing plate at a switching movement in the sense of<br>
arrow 21 by the ramp formed on the slide strip running onto the roller 11 and<br>
thus abutting on the same by its larger-height portion. The switching movement<br>
of the point of frog 1 is thereby facilitated and the wear minimized. As the point<br>
of frog 1 approaches the wing rail 2, the roller 11 reaches again the smaller-<br>
height region of the slide strip via the ramp illustrated on the left-hand side of<br>
the drawing so as to cause the point of frog 1 to abut on the wing rail 2 and rest<br>
again on the ground plate.<br>
Figure 3 depicts the roller device 6, which, as opposed to the roller device 7, is<br>
not fixed to the wing rails but to the ground plate 4. In the region of the<br>
arrangement of the roller device 6, the switching movement of the point of frog<br>
occurs over a smaller switching path, and the shape of the guiding path on the<br>
slide strip 8 is, therefore, adapted to the reduced displacement path. The point<br>
of frog 1 in this region is comprised of the main point 22 and the side point 23.<br>
As for the rest, the reference numerals used in Figure 2 have been retained for<br>
identical parts.<br>
