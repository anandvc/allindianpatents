HINDUSTAN UNILEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br>

CLEANING COMPOSITIONS<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to cleaning compositions, to their preparation, to cleaning methods and to processes for enhancing the retention of cleaning agents into carriers. More specifically, the invention relates to cleaning compositions for use in hand dishwashing.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Liquid household cleaning products that provide thickening upon dilution are known in the art, as detailed in the following references:<br>
US 5,922,664 describes a composition comprising a micellar dispersion of a mixture of at least two anionic surfactants having different resistance to electrolytic salting out, and alkali metal citrate. The attained viscosity upon dilution does not go beyond 1,4 00 mPas.<br>
EP 314,232 mentions a composition of: (a) a primary surfactant chosen from amine, amine oxide, betaine or quaternary ammonium compounds, preferably an amine oxide, (b) a hydrotrope co-surfactant compound, e.g. ethanol, methanol or triethanol-amine, and (c) a water-ionisable non-surfactant compound, e.g. inorganic acids, neutral salts or alkali.<br>
WO 96/32464 discloses a kit comprising a sponge and a water-thickening surfactant composition based on electrolyte<br><br>
WO 2007/028446	PCT/EP2006/007038<br><br>
concentration. This document also shows the viscosity profile of the disclosed compositions, wherein the viscosity peak reaches 1,685 mPas, which is only 2.7 times higher than the initial viscosity of 620 mPas.<br>
Prior art documents teach simple compositions that can reach high viscosities upon dilution, improving its use in situations similar to manual dishwashing. However, prior art compositions present technical and/or economical bottlenecks that are solved by the present invention, such as obtaining cleaning compositions having enhanced retention in a carrier and/or high viscosity upon dilution, even at high dilution rates. These and other technical problems described above are solved by the present invention.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
In one aspect there are provided compositions with enhanced retention of its cleaning agents (surfactants) in a carrier upon dilution. These compositions have advantages over the prior art, such as lower consumption of the cleaning composition in use, thus giving better yield, being more economical in use and being environmentally friendly. The enhanced retention of cleaning agent in a carrier also decreases the time spent in refilling the carrier, so that the cleaning compositions of the invention are faster and more efficient in use. Furthermore, the advantages of the compositions of the invention allow a more rational use of containers for cleaning compositions.<br><br>
WO 2007/028446	PCT/EP2006/007038<br><br>
The compositions according to the invention, which comprise surfactants and viscosity modulating agents, do not decrease in viscosity upon addition of a diluent, but rather increase in viscosity. For hand dishwashing such compositions preferably have a low viscosity initially and only increase in viscosity after addition of a certain amount of diluent. This allows penetration of the composition through the pores of a porous carrier, while at the same time keeping the composition within the carrier for a longer period. The selective way by which the composition of the invention behaves provides an advantageous balance between low initial viscosity, maximum viscosity and final viscosity, as well as provides an advantageous balance between viscosity increasing ratio (between minimum and maximum viscosity) and viscosity decreasing ratio (between maximum and final viscosity).<br>
In another aspect, there are described cleaning compositions that provide increased viscosity upon dilution even at high dilution rates.<br>
In another aspect, there are provided cleaning compositions having low initial viscosity so as to easily penetrate into a carrier.<br>
The cleaning compositions comprise a mixture of surfactants and viscosity modulating agents and other optional ingredients and provide:<br>
low initial viscosity so as to easily penetrate into a<br>
carrier;<br>
viscosity increase upon dilution after penetrating into<br>
said carrier, so that the cleaning compositions stay<br><br>
WO 2007/028446	PCT/EP2006/007038<br><br>
longer within the carrier, thus providing enhanced<br>
performance even after repeatedly rinsing;<br>
on dilution the cleaning composition becomes a stable and<br>
transparent gel; and<br>
controlled and sustained release of surfactants.<br>
In another aspect there is provided a cleaning method for surfaces, particularly hard surfaces, which is more efficient and economic than the previously known cleaning methods.<br>
In yet another aspect there is provided a process for enhancing the retention of cleaning agents into carriers such as sponges and the like.<br>

Viscosity Modulating Agents<br>
The compositions according to the invention comprise at least one viscosity modulating agent as an essential ingredient. The purpose of these agents is to increase the viscosity from the low initial value of the undiluted composition to a higher value upon dilution. The low viscosity helps the composition to easily penetrate a carrier, such as a sponge. Preferably, the undiluted composition has a viscosity below 500mPas, more preferably at least SOmPas, most preferably 250-350mPas.<br>
All viscosity measurements were made at about 25°C, using a Haake VT 550 viscometer at 106 s"1 with an MVI spindle for measurements from 0 to 1000 mPas and at 21 s"1 with an MVII<br><br>
WO 2007/028446	PCT/EP2006/007038<br><br>
spindle for measurements from 1000 to 8000 mPas.<br>
The viscosity modulating agents comprise one or more electrolytes, organic solvents, and mixtures thereof. The compositions according to the invention comprise at least one electrolyte.<br>
Electrolytes are water-soluble organic and inorganic salts (other than anionic surfactants), wherein the cation is chosen from alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, ammonium and mixture thereof and the anion is chosen from chloride, sulfate, phosphate, acetate, nitrate and mixtures thereof. Particularly useful are potassium, sodium and ammonium chloride.<br>
The amount of electrolyte should be sufficient to increase the viscosity of the composition upon dilution. A useful amount of electrolyte in the compositions of the invention is from about 2.0% to about 4.5% by weight of the composition, more particularly between about 3.5% and about 3.9%. Furthermore, the ratio between the amount of surfactant and the amount of electrolyte is between about 4.3 and about 12, more particularly between about 9 and about 11.<br>
Useful organic solvents to be added in addition to electrolytes as viscosity modulating agents are C1-C4 alkyl alcohols having one to three hydroxyl groups, and the concentration of said solvents is chosen so as to increase the viscosity. Preferred solvents are ethanol and/or propylene glycol, preferably each in an amount of about 2% to about 7% wt of the total composition.<br><br>
WO 2007/028446	PCT/EP2006/007038<br><br>
The ratio of the amount of surfactant(s) to total viscosity modulating agent(s) (i.e. electrolytes + solvents) is preferably between 1 and 6.<br>
Preferably the peak viscosity of the diluted composition is reached at a ratio of diluent to composition of between 1.5:1 and 2.5:1, most preferable at around 2:1 (e.g. between 1.8:1 and 2.2:1). Furthermore, the peak viscosity is at least 5 times the initial viscosity, preferably at least 10 times. Finally, the viscosity of the diluted composition exceeds the initial viscosity up to a dilution of at least 3.5:1 (diluent : composition). The diluent is preferably water or a mixture of solvents comprising water as the main solvent. More preferably the diluent is water.<br>
Optional Ingredients<br>
The compositions of the invention optionally comprise other ingredients, such as fragrances, preservatives and colorants. Particularly colorants are useful to indicate the presence of the compositions in an absorbent carrier. Examples of useful colorants are: Blue FDC (CI:42090); Patent blue (CI:42051); Blue ABL 80 (CI:61585); Red punzo No 7 (CI:16255), Red Puricolor Are 14 (CI: 14720) and mixtures thereof.<br>
The present invention also discloses a method for cleaning domestic surfaces, particularly hard surfaces, using the cleaning compositions according to the invention. The cleaning method of the invention has several advantages over known methods. In one aspect, it provides less consumption of cleaning composition and is therefore more economial and<br><br>
WO 2007/028446	PCT/EP2006/007038<br><br>
environmentally friendly.<br>
The cleaning method of the invention comprises the steps of: i)    contacting a carrier with the composition of the<br>
invention; <br>
ii)   treating the combination of carrier and composition<br>
with water; and <br>
iii)  performing a cleaning operation of a surface with the<br>
carrier.<br>
In an alternative, but less preferred variation, water can be added to the absorbent carrier before the composition is added to it.<br>
A cleaning operation is typically represented by pressing the absorbent carrier to the surface and scrubbing it with circular movements, or in any other way, to aid in the removal of soil, grease or dirt from the surface. Dish surfaces and crockery are particular examples of household surfaces that can be cleaned with the composition of the invention.<br>
Useful or absorbent or porous carriers are known, particularly the ones comprising voids where liquid can be stored, for instance, sponges (natural, polymeric, steel, etc), scouring pads, cloths. The composition is particularly suitable to be applied onto sponges in the cleaning method.<br>
The ratio between the amount of water and the amount of cleaning composition to be used in the cleaning method according to the invention is preferably from about 0.5 to about 5, more preferably about 0.5-4, most preferably up to<br><br>
WO 2007/028446	PCT/EP2006/007038<br><br>
about  3.5.<br>
The invention further provides a process for enhancing the retention of cleaning agents into a carrier comprising the steps of:<br>
a)	providing a solution of surfactants;<br>
b)	providing a solution of viscosity modulating agent;<br>
c)	mixing the solution of surfactants with the solution of viscosity modulating agent.<br>
Description of the Drawings<br>
Figure 1 shows the viscosity profile of 4 known and commercially available compositions. One of those compositions, named Prior Art 1, displays viscosity increase of upon dilution; however it has an extremely poor performance and therefore it is not practical in use since the viscosity increase does not last upon continued dilution. Formulations A and B of the invention, on the other hand, do have the property of enhanced and sustained viscosity upon dilution, showing a peak of about 7,000 mPas which is reached with 20g of water for Composition A and a peak of about 5,000 mPas for Composition B. Figure 1 also shows that the retention of the compositions of the invention into the carrier increases upon dilution up to a ratio of diluent : cleaning composition of 2:1, since the viscosity increases during said dilution period up to a viscosity peak. Figure 1 further shows the viscosity of the compositions of the invention is higher than their initial viscosity up to a ratio of diluent : cleaning composition of at least 3.5:1. On the other hand, previously known compositions sharply decreases in viscosity after the<br><br>
WO 2007/028446	PCT/EP2006/007038<br><br>
viscosity peak is reached and also at a much lower dilution ratio, thus substantially decreasing the practicality of the dilution-thickening effect in actual conditions of use.<br>
Figure 2 shows the comparison between a known composition that does not have the property of enhanced viscosity upon dilution (-♦-), and Formulation A (-■-) and Formulation B (-Q-) of the invention regarding the release of anionic surfactants from a sponge by the Direct Application method (standard soil/dose 3 grams). Wash liquor is discharged in the sink and collected for quantification of surfactants wasted on the article to be cleansed (in this case a plate). "x" axis represents the number of plates washed by the Direct Application method, while "y" axis represents the quantity in milligrams of anionic surfactants collected after said washings. It is clear from Figure 2 that the compositions of the invention have much more controlled release of anionic surfactantss when compared to the known composition.<br><br>

Water was added to the compositions above and viscosity change was measured for both compositions. The results are shown in Figure 1 where it is shown that the viscosity reaches its peak for Compositions A and B when the weight ratio of water to cleaning composition is around 2 and an increased viscosity is maintained for a dilution ratio of at least 3.5:1.  Also, the maximum viscosity value is at least 10 times higher the initial viscosity value.<br>
This behavior is not obtained by any of the prior art compositions. Although Prior Art 1 composition also has increased viscosity upon dilution, this effect occurs in a very limited dilution range; its viscosity peak is reached<br><br>
WO 2007/028446	PCT/EP2006/007038<br><br>
when the ratio water : cleaning composition is 0.5:1, its viscosity peak is only 6.32 times higher than the initial viscosity and its increased viscosity is not maintained above a dilution rate of about 1.5:1.<br>
A wash test was made comparing three compositions: Prior art composition (-♦-), Composition A (-■-) of Table I and Composition B (-D-) of Table II. The washing method is the direct application method with a standard fat/flour/milk soil. Plates are soiled with the same amount of this soil and then washed in the following way:<br>
The dishwash product is poured directly on a wet sponge, some foam is generated and then each plate is washed with the same number of circular movements and then rinsed. The wash liquor is discharged in the sink and collected for quantification of surfactant wasted on each plate. The amount of anionic surfactant is quantified using a special electrode sensitive to anionic surfactants. The amount of anionic surfactant is plotted against the number of plates washed and the results are shown in Figure 2, wherein one can clearly see that the compositions according to the invention provide a longer lasting and better controlled release of surfactant<br>
A further composition according to the invention was prepared according to the Table III below:<br><br>

Water was added to the compositions above and viscosity change was measured for both compositions.<br>
The results are shown in Table V below. The table shows the viscosity of the pure product (100%) and dilutions of 70%. 60%, 50%, 40% and 30% product in tap water.<br>

50%	6780	4740<br>
40%	4380	2930<br>
30%	830	340<br>
Both compositions show a good thickening effect, reaching up to more than 10 times the initial viscosity. The table also shows that the position of the 'viscosity peak' can be fine-tuned by the choice and concentration of electrolyte and solvent.<br><br><br>
