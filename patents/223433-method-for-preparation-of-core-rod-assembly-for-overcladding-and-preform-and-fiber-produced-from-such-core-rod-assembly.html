3. Preamble to the Description:-<br>
Complete Specification:<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the<br>
manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
STER/P A/040<br>
Field of the Invention:<br><br>
The present invention relates to method for preparation of core rod <br>
5 	assembly for overcladding. Particularly, the present invention relates to a method for preparation of core rod assembly which is suitable for overcladding so as to form daughter preform which is suitable for fiber draw process. The present invention also relates to a core rod assembly for overcladding, and to the daughter preform and optical fiber produced from such core rod assembly.<br>
10<br>
Background of the Invention:<br>
Optical fibers are inherently versatile as a transmission medium for all forms of information, be it voice, video or data. The optical fibers are drawn<br>
15 	from an optical fiber preform. The optical fiber of predetermined dimension is drawn either from the solid glass preform [mother preform] or from sintered preform [daughter preform] by subjecting one end of the preform [mother preform or daughter preform] to a high temperature, for example above 2000°C. The sintered preform [daughter preform] is prepared from a core rod having soot<br>
20      porous body [also referred as soot preform].<br>
The daughter preform manufacturing process primarily involves a step of preparing the core rod comprising core of the fiber and part of clad which is followed by over-cladding. The core rod can be prepared by methods known in<br>
25 	the art, such as modified chemical vapour deposition (MCVD), plasma chemical vapour deposition (PCVD), Atmospheric chemical vapour deposition (ACVD), vapour axial deposition (VAD) etc. The over-cladding of the core rod can be carried out by various methods, such as glass tube jacketing, ACVD soot overcladding,  VAD  soot  over-cladding,  plasma over-cladding etc.  Therefore,  the<br>
30 	daughter preform can be manufactured by any combination of the core rod manufacturing methods and the over-cladding preparation methods.<br>
Typically, the daughter preform can be manufactured by any of the<br>
above-said conventional methods, for example by ACVD method, which is <br>
35       described herein for reference.<br>
2<br><br>
STER/P A/040<br>
In accordance with a typical ACVD process to manufacture a soot porous body, as illustrated in accompanying Figure 1, the preparation of soot porous<br>
5	body 1 comprises the following steps. The glass-forming precursor compounds are oxidized and hydrolyzed to form porous silica based materials 2. The porous silica based materials 2 are deposited on a tapered cylindrical member referred as mandrel 3, which can be any commercially available mandrel with or without any specific preparation, preferably with specific preparation to remove the <br>
10 		contaminants therefrom which is provided with a handle rod 4 and fitted on a lathe 5 to form soot porous body 1.<br>
During the step of deposition, the mandrel 3 is rotated in a direction as illustrated by an arrow 6 and also moved along its length with reference to<br>
15 	burner 7 to deposit the soot particles 2 on the mandrel 3 for producing soot porous body 1. During the deposition process, the dopant chemicals for example GeCl4 may also be deposited to form the core of the preform and later the dopant chemicals may be terminated to form clad of the preform. The amount of deposition of the clad region 11 and core region 10 is achieved to<br>
20 	have any desired ratio diameter of clad region 11 to the diameter of core region 10.<br>
After completion of deposition, the soot porous body 1 is removed from lathe 5 along with mandrel 3 and handle rod 4, and the mandrel 3 is removed/ <br>
25 	detached, during the mandrel removal step, from the soot porous body 1 thereby resulting in formation of a hollow cylindrical soot porous body 8 (herein after referred to as hollow soot porous body) having a centerline 9 therethrough [Figure 2].<br>
30	The hollow soot porous body 8 thus formed comprises a core region 10<br>
having a centerline hole 9 and a clad region 11 of the optical fiber preform [Figure 3], and said core region 10 has refractive index greater than that of the clad region 11.<br>
3<br><br>
STER/PA/040<br>
After removal/detachment of mandrel 3 a centerline 9 is created inside the soot porous body 1.<br>
5	Now referring to accompanying Figure 4, the prepared hollow soot porous<br>
body 101 is transferred to the sintering furnace 100 in order to achieve dehydration, and sintering of the hollow soot porous body 101 to form dehydrated and sintered hollow glass body.<br>
10	The dehydrated and sintered hollow glass body is subjected to step of<br>
collapsing of the centerline 102 to form a solid glass preform 103 [Figure 5] with or without requiring any step of drilling or grinding or etching of the centerline 9/102 before steps of consolidation and collapsing.<br>
15	Thus, the prepared hollow soot porous body 101 is dehydrated, sintered<br>
and collapsed to convert it into solid glass preform 103.<br>
In a typical embodiment of ACVD method, the hollow soot porous body 101, one end of which is provided with a plug 116 is inserted inside the furnace<br>
20 	100 with the help of the handle rod 106. The driving mechanism (not shown) facilitates lowering of the hollow soot porous body 101 into the furnace 100. The furnace 100 comprises a glass muffle tube 110 having a diameter sufficient to accommodate the hollow soot porous body 101 and to adequately provide the environment necessary for dehydration, sintering and collapsing. The muffle<br>
25 	tube 110 is suitable for heating to temperatures necessary for dehydration and simultaneous sintering and collapsing process steps with the heating means (not shown) which are suitably fitted to the sintering furnace 100.<br><br>
The heating means selected may be suitable to create three heat zones <br>
30	inside the muffle tube 110 over a length. A thermocouple (not shown) provided in the furnace 100 measures the temperature of the hot zones inside the furnace created by the heating means, and the data measurement is fed to the temperature controller (not shown) that controls the temperature inside the muffle tube 110. <br>
35<br>
4<br><br>
STER/P A/040<br>
The furnace 100 is provided with an  inlet    port      115     located        suitably   on 	the furnace, preferably near the bottom of the muffle tube 110 for supplying                   desired gases in the furnace. The top end of the muffle tube 110 is suitably                                              <br>
5	 closed with the lid 113 to achieve the preferred temperature profile inside the muffle tube 110 and to maintain the same during the dehydration, and simultaneous sintering and collapsing process steps, and to avoid leakage of gases from the muffle tube 110 to the outside environment. A suction port 114 is suitably provided near the top of muffle tube 110 to facilitate evacuation of 10 the gases from the muffle tube 110 as and when required or on completion of the process.<br>
In accordance with the known art methods, the mother preform produced is subjected, in a conventional manner, to a step of reducing the<br>
15 	diameter to form a core rod having reduced diameter, which is then subjected, in a conventional manner, to a step of overcladding to form a soot preform comprising soot porous body having core rod, also referred as soot preform, which is then subjected, in a conventional manner, to a sintering step to form a daughter preform, which is then subjected to a step of fiber draw to draw the<br>
20      fiber.<br>
In accordance with methods known in the art, the opposite ends of the core rod having reduced diameter are first attached to glass rods by heating means before performing overcladding step thereon to form soot preform. This <br>
25      process step is typically known as core rod assembly preparation step.<br>
Accordingly, a typical process for preparation of optical fiber from daughter preform comprises the steps of:-<br>
30      a)	preparing the mandrel;<br>
b)	placing the mandrel over a lathe;<br>
c)	depositing soot particles on the mandrel to prepare a soot porous body;<br>
d)	removing the mandrel to form hollow soot porous body having capillary therethrough;<br>
5<br><br>
STER/P A/040<br>
e)	dehydrating the hollow soot porous body to form dehydrated soot porous<br>
body;<br>
f)	performing  sintering  step   on  dehydrated   soot  porous  body  to  form<br>
5	sintered glass body;<br>
g)	performing collapsing step to collapse the capillary of the sintered glass<br>
body to form solid glass preform;<br>
h)        performing the step of reducing the diameter of the solid glass preform to<br>
form a core rod having reduced diameter;<br>
10     i)	performing core rod assembly preparation step to form a core rod<br>
assembly for the overcladding step;<br>
j)	performing overcladding step on the core rod assembly to form soot<br>
	preform comprising soot porous body having core rod;<br>
k)        	performing  sintering  step  on  the  soot  preform  to  form  a daughter<br>
15	preform; and<br>
1)	performing fiber draw step on the daughter preform having peform cone<br>
of desired shape and dimensions including diameter to draw the fiber<br>
therefrom.<br>
20	It may be noted that for the ease of understanding the soot preform<br>
comprising soot porous body having core rod is referred as "soot preform" which may not be confused with "mother preform" or "daughter preform".<br>
As described herein, in accordance with the known art, the process of<br>
25      core rod assembly preparation suitable for overcladding [above process step i)<br>
          involves attaching or fixing or welding opposite ends of the core rod to glass<br>
          rods by heating to a temperature for attaching or fixing or welding the gloss<br>
rods to the opposite ends of the core rod.<br>
30	It has  been  observed  that the  known methods of core rod assembly<br>
preparation involve process step of heat treatment of opposite ends of the core rod to attach or fix or weld glass rods thereto. The known heat treatment process steps suffer from following drawbacks, disadvantages and limitations.<br>
6<br><br>
STER/PA/040<br>
The main drawback of the known methods of core rod assembly                  preparation involving conventional process step of heat treatment of opposite                         ends   of    the   core   rod   to   attach    or    fix    or   weld     [herein   after   for   convenience <br>
5 	referred as to fix or fixing] glass rods thereto is that it causes stress formation at and around the joints formed between the glass rod and core rod. The stress formation in the core rod assembly has been observed to cause breakage of the core rod assembly during its handling and deposition of soot thereon to form the soot preform.<br>
10<br>
The another main drawback of the known methods of core rod assembly           preparation involving conventional process step of heat treatment of opposite                        ends of the core rod to fix glass rods thereto is that it causes physical defects,                             for   example   cracks   and   breaks   at    and    around    the     joints   formed   between    the<br>
15 	glass rod and core rod, and such physical defects in the core rod assembly have been observed to cause bubbles and voids in the soot preform produced from such core rod assembly which in-turn results in breakage of the optical fiber during fiber drawing step, and hence, a loss of the productivity of the process.<br>
20	The  another problem  of stress formation  and  formation  of physical<br>
defects in the core rod assembly during conventional heat treatment process is that the breakage of the core rod assembly may take place at any time during the soot deposition which not only results in total loss of soot deposition, but also causes damage to the burner, because there is every possibility that the<br>
25 	core rod assembly will fall on the burner meaning thereby the conventional heat treatment process suffer from time loss, production loss and financial loss.<br>
It has been further observed that the stress formation and formation of physical defects in the core rod assembly also lead to transmission loss in the <br>
30      resulting optical fiber or distortion of other optical parameters, for example, polarization mode dispersion, cutoff wavelength etc.<br>
If conventional  heat  treatment  is   performed  by   graphite   resistance<br>
            method it has been observed that due to relatively higher process time it causes<br>
35      graphite oxidation which in-turn results in formation of oxidation products, for<br>
7<br><br>
STER/PA/040<br>
example ash, graphite particles etc. which adheres to the core rod surface, and such   contamination   of  the   core   rod   with   unwanted   particles   results   in production of a daughter preform which will produce a fiber having increased <br>
5      transmission loss and poor strength.<br>
Similarly, if conventional heat treatment is performed by lasers, such as carbon dioxide lasers, which are clean heat source to use, power consumption has been observed to be very high rendering the overall process very expensive. <br>
10<br>
Further, it has also been observed that large amount of thermal induced stress in the core rod at and around the joint of the core rod and glass rod area adversely effects joint strength which upon further processing may shatter the core rod. 	<br>
15<br>
Accordingly, the known methods of core rod assembly preparation are observed to be uneconomical for commercial applications.<br>
Need of the Invention:<br>
20<br>
Therefore, there is a need to have a method for preparation of core rod<br>
assembly for overcladding, particularly a method for preparation of core rod<br>
assembly which is suitable for overcladding so as to form daughter preform<br>
which is suitable for fiber draw process. <br>
25<br>
Objects of the Invention:<br>
Accordingly, the main object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
          method for preparation of core rod assembly which is suitable for overcladding<br>
30      so as to form daughter preform which in-turn is suitable for fiber draw process.<br>
The another main object of the present invention is to provide a method for preparation of core rod assembly wherein no stress is formed at and around the joints formed between the glass rod and core rod meaning thereby the core<br>
8<br><br>
STER/PA/040<br>
rod assembly produced will not break, due to stress, during its handling and deposition of soot thereon to form the soot preform.<br>
5	Still another main object of the present invention is to provide a method<br>
for preparation of core rod assembly wherein formation of physical defects, for example cracks and breaks at and around the joints formed between the glass rod and core rod is reduced, and hence, possibility of formation of bubbles and voids in the soot preform produced from such core rod assembly is reduced <br>
10 	meaning thereby possibility of breakage of the optical fiber, due to physical defects during fiber drawing step is reduced, and accordingly, possibility of loss of productivity of the process is reduced.<br>
Yet another main object of the present invention is to provide a method <br>
15	for preparation of core rod assembly wherein possibility of stress formation and formation of physical defects in the core rod assembly is eliminated or greatly reduced, and hence, the possibility of breakage of the core rod assembly is eliminated or greatly reduced meaning thereby possibility of loss of soot deposition and damage of the burners is eliminated or greatly reduced. <br>
20<br>
Further object of the present invention is to provide a method for preparation of core rod assembly for overcladding wherein the core rod assembly is suitable for overcladding and to form suitable daughter preform.<br>
25	One particular object of the present invention is to provide a method for<br>
preparation   of   core   rod   assembly   for   overcladding   which   can   overcome drawbacks, disadvantages and limitations of the prior art.<br>
Another particular object of the present invention is to provide a method <br>
30	 for preparation of core rod assembly for overcladding wherein no or reduced physical defects and stress is caused in the core rod, and hence the possibility of transmission loss in the resulting optical fiber or distortion of other optical parameters, for example, polarization mode dispersion, cutoff wavelength etc. is greatly reduced.<br>
35<br>
9<br><br>
STER/P A/040<br>
Still another particular object of the present invention is to provide a method for preparation of core rod assembly for overcladding which even by performing heating by graphite resistance method does not cause graphite <br>
5	oxidation, and hence, overcomes associated problems of formation of oxidation products, for example ash, graphite particles etc. which are known to adhere to the core rod surface. Accordingly, the present invention aims to provide a method for core rod assembly preparation wherein possibility of contamination of core rod with unwanted particles is greatly reduced, and hence, the daughter <br>
10 	preform produced from such core rod assembly will produce a fiber having decreased transmission loss and increased strength.<br>
Still further particular object of the present invention is to provide a method for preparation of core rod assembly for overcladding which even if <br>
15  	 heating is performed by lasers, such as carbon dioxide lasers, does not require higher power consumption meaning thereby which is relatively less expensive.<br>
Yet further particular object of the present invention is to provide a method for preparation of core rod assembly for overcladding wherein <br>
20 	possibility of thermal induced stress in the core rod at and around the joint of the core rod and glass rod area is greatly reduced meaning thereby the joint strength is not adversely effected, and hence, the further processing of the produced core rod assembly will be safer and convenient.<br>
25	It  is  also  an  object  of the  present invention  to provide  a core  rod<br>
assembly which is suitable for overcladding to form a suitable daughter preform which will be capable of fiber draw process to produce suitable optical fiber.<br>
The   other  objects   and   advantages  of the  present  invention  will  be <br>
30    	  apparent from the following description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings which are incorporated for the purpose of illustration of present invention and not to limit scope thereof.<br>

10<br><br>
STER/P A/040<br>
The inventors have surprisingly observed that if core rod is heated in a             controlled manner to have its controlled heating after fixing the glass rods at its                   opposite ends and before performing step of overcladding, the problems <br>

In accordance with one of the preferred embodiments of the present<br>
        invention, the fire polish, that is, the controlled heat treatment of the core rod<br>
       assembly is carried out while rotating the core rod assembly to achieve the<br>
5     uniform heat treatment. Preferably, the rotation speed varies from about 50 to<br>
about 70 rpm.<br>
It has been found that on following above described controlled heat treatment method of the present invention no stress formation takes place at <br>
10 	and around the joints formed between the glass rod and core rod. Accordingly, no breaks have been observed in the core rod assembly produced by present method during its handling and deposition of soot thereon to form the soot preform.<br>
15	It has also been found that on following above described controlled heat<br>
treatment method of the present invention, the formation of physical defects, for example cracks and breaks at and around the joints formed between the glass rod and core rod is greatly reduced, and hence, the possibility of formation of bubbles and voids in the soot preform produced from such core rod assembly is<br>
20 	greatly reduced meaning thereby the possibility of breakage of the optical fiber, due to physical defects during fiber drawing step is greatly reduced, and accordingly, the possibility of loss of productivity of the process is greatly reduced, which make the present method economically viable.<br>
25	As the present method has been found to be free from stress formation<br>
and formation of physical defects in the core rod assembly, the possibility of breakage of the core rod assembly during soot deposition is eliminated or greatly reduced meaning thereby the possibility of loss of soot deposition and damage of the burners is eliminated or greatly reduced.<br>
30<br>
In accordance with present invention, the core rod with reduced diameter can be prepared by any method. As exemplary embodiment, the core rod having reduced diameter may be prepared in following manner:-<br>
35      i)	preparing the mandrel;<br>
19<br><br>
STER/P A/040<br>
ii)	placing the mandrel over a lathe;<br>
iii)       depositing soot particles on the mandrel to prepare a soot porous body;<br>
iv)        removing the mandrel to form hollow soot porous body having capillary<br>
5	therethrough;<br>
v)	dehydrating the hollow soot porous body to form dehydrated soot porous<br>
body; vi)        performing  sintering  step   on   dehydrated   soot  porous  body  to  form<br>
sintered glass body; <br>
10      vii)       performing collapsing step to collapse the capillary of the sintered glass<br>
body to form solid glass preform; and viii)      performing the step of reducing the diameter of the solid glass preform to<br>
form a core rod having reduced diameter.<br>
15	It is apparent from the foregoing description that the presently disclosed<br>
method has overcome disadvantages, limitations and drawbacks of the prior<br>
art.<br><br>
It may be noted that various terms, for example adjustable mandrel, soot <br>
20	porous body, hollow soot porous body, capillary, dehydrated soot porous body, sintered glass body, solid glass preform, core rod having reduced diameter, soot porous body having core rod, core rod, mother preform, soot preform, daughter preform, preform end, preform cone, sintered core rod etc. as employed herein are merely intended to illustrate the present invention and are not intended to <br>
25 	restrict scope of the present invention. It is obvious for the persons skilled in the art that alternative terms may also be employed to describe the present method without deviating from the intended scope of the present invention.<br><br>
It may also be noted that the presently disclosed method has been <br>
30      described with reference to ACVD method. However, the present method is suitable   even   for   other  alternative  methods  known  for  producing mother preform and daughter preform.<br>
