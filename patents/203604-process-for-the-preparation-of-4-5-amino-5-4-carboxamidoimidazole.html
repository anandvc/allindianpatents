				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to processes for simply and efficiently preparxng 4(5)-aminoimidazole-5-(4)-carboxamido derivatives and intermediates thereof, which are useful as intermediates of agricultural chemicals and medicines. Description of the Prior Art<br>
Among the compounds represented by formula (I):<br><br>
for example, 1H-4(5)-ammoimidazole-5(4)-carboxamide (wherein R1 and R2 represent hydrogen atoms (hereinafter abbreviated as AICA)), and hydrochloric salts thereof are useful intermediates of medicines, and for example, have been known as basic ingredients of anti-cancer drugs such as dacarbazine and temozoromide, and hepatic protectives such as urazamide.<br>
The processes for synthesizing these include the process wherein 4-nitroimidazole-5-carboxamido is contact-reduced, the process wherein phenylazomalonamidine is reduced and cyclized in formic acid, the process wherein ct-amino-a-cyanoacetamido is used as a raw material, and the process wherein a compound having a purine core is decomposed. However,<br>
1<br>
4<br><br>
these are insufficient in terms of raw materials, manipu) ation and industry.<br>
Also, there is the process wherein from industrially available diaminomaleonitrile (hereinafter abbreviated as DAMN), 4,5-dicyanoimidazole is synthesized, which is hydrolyzed (Japanese Patent Publication No. 21026/1966) to synthesize 1H-4(5)~cyanoimidazole-5(4)-carboxamide, which is converted to 1H-4(5)-aminoimidazole-5(4)-carbonitrile (hereinafter abbreviated as AICN) using the Hoffman rearrangement reaction (Japanese Patent Publication No. 10889/1971J/ and subsequently it is hydrolyzed to synthesize AICA. However, it has been problematic in that a yield from the Hoffman rearrangement reaction is low, steps in the process are many and a yield of the objective is low.<br>
Additionally, B. L. Booth et al. (J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1:1705, 1990) reported that AICN could be synthesized by cyclizing N-(2-amino-l, 2-dicyanovinyl) formamidine (hereinafter abbreviated as AMD) but did not describe the synthesis of AICA.<br>
Also, B. L. Booth et al. (J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans., 1:2120, 1992; J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans ., 1:669, 1995) reported that l-substituted-5-aminoimidazole-4-carbonitrile could be synthesized by cyclizing N-(2-amino-l, 2-dicyanovmyl)-N1 -substituted-formamidine but did not describe the synthesis of l-substituted-5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide which is one of the target substances of the present invention.<br>
Also, B. L. Booth et al. (J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans.,<br>
2<br><br>
1:1521, 3 987) reported the process for synthesizing 1,2-substituted imidazole as shown by the following formula.<br><br>
However, it is not suitable for synthesis of N-non-substituents due to the use of a special nitrilium salt, yet it has been problematic in that a yield from cyclization is low and the objective was not obtained with a sufficient yield.<br>
Moreover, it has also been problematic in that in the case of conducting a reaction of alkylation of lH-4(5)-aminoimidazole-5(4)-carboxamide, both 1- and 3-positions are alkylated and thus its selectivity of position is low.<br>
As the process for synthesis of compounds represented by formula (II) which can be intermediates in synthesis of compounds represented by formula (I), for example, R. F. Shuman et al. (J. Org. Chem., 44:4532, 1979) have reported that N-(2-amino-l,2-dicyanovinyl) formamidine can be synthesized by the method in which DAMN and formamidine acetate are refluxed in ethanol. However, its yield was only 2% and the method is unrealistic as an industrial process for the preparation.<br>
Also, B. L. Booth et al. (J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans., 1:1705, 1990) have reported that DAMN and triethylorthoformate<br>
3<br><br>
are reacted xn dioxane to synthesize ethyl N-(2-amino-l-, 2-diaminovinyl) formimidate, which is further reacted with ammonia in chloroform at a low temperature of -20Â°C or below using aniline hydrochloride as a catalyst resulting in being capable of synthesizing N-(2-amino-l,2-dicyanovinyl) formamidine. However, in this method there are many problems such as the vexatious complication of reaction manipulation, reaction at a low temperature, many solvents being required, potential environmental pollution by halide solvents and the like, and it was insufficient as an industrial process for the preparation. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
As mentioned above, no simple and efficient process has been known for preparing 4 (5) -aminoimidazole-5 (4) -carboxamide derivatives and intermediates thereof, which are useful as intermediates of agricultural chemicals and medicines, and the present invention is aimed to provide processes for the preparation thereof.<br>
