Alternatively the compound of the invention can be used in sequence with the other active ingredient.<br>
The diluent or carrier in the composition of the invention can be a solid or a liquid optionally in association with a surface-active agent, for example a dispersing agent, emulsifying agent or wetting agent.

oxygen-containing amine such as an amine oxide or polyoxyethylene alkylamine; an amide-Jinked amme prepared by the condensation of a carboxylic acid with a di-or polyamine; or a quaternary ammonium salt.<br>
The compositions of the invention can take any form known in the art for the formulation of agrochemicals, for example, a solution a dispersion, an aqueous emulsion, a dusting powder, a seed dressing, a fumigant, a smoke, a dispersible powder, an emulsifiable concentrate or granules.    Moreover it can be in a suitable form for direct application or as a concentrate or primary composition which requires dilution with a suitable quantity of water or other diluent before application.<br>
An emulsifiable concentrate comprises a compound of the invention dissolved in a water-immiscible solvent which is formed into an emulsion with water in the presence of an emulsifying agent<br>
A dusting powder comprises a compound of the invention intimately mixed and ground with a solid pulverulent diluent, for example, kaolin.<br>
A granular solid comprises a compound of the invention associated with similar diluents to those which may be employed in dusting powders, but the mixture is granulated by known methods.   Alternatively it comprises the active ingredient absorbed or adsorbed on a pre-granular diluent, for example. Fuller's earth, attapulgrte or limestone grit.<br>
Wettable powders, granules or grains usually comprise the active ingredient in admixture with a suitable surfactant and an inert powder diluent such as china<br>
ciay.<br>
Another suitable concentrate is a flowable suspension concentrate which is formed by grinding the compound with water or other liquid, a wetting agent and a suspending agent.<br>
The concentration of the active ingredient in the composition of the present invention, as applied to plants is preferably within the range of 0.0001 to 1.0 per<br>
cent by weigh;, especially 0.0001 to 0.01 per cent by weight. In a primary composition, the amount of active ingredient can vary widely and can be, for example, from 5 to 95 per cent by weight of the composition.<br>
In the method of the invention the compound is generally applied to seeds, plants or their habitat. Thus, the compound can be applied directly to the soil before, at or after drilling so that the presence of active compound in the soil can control the growth of fungi which may attack seeds.   When the soil is treated directly the active compound can be applied in any manner which allows it to be intimately mixed with the soil such as by spraying, by broadcasting a solid fcrm of granules, or by applying the active ingredient at the same time as drilling by inserting it in the same drill as the seeds     A suitable application rate is within the range of from 5 to 1000 g per hectare, more preferably from 10 to 500 g per hectare.<br>
Alternatively the active compound can be applied directly to the plant by, for example, spraying or dusting either at the time when the fungus has begun to appear on the plant or before the appearance of fungus as a protective measure. In both such cases the preferred mode of application is by foliar spraying.   It is generally important to obtain good control of fungi in the early stages of plant growth as this is the time when the plant can be most severely damaged.  The spray or dust can conveniently contain a pre- or post-emergence herbicide if this is thought necessary.   Sometimes, it is practicable to treat the roots of a plant before or during planting, for example, by dipping the roots in a suitable liquid or solid composition.   When the active compound is applied directly to the plant a suitable rate of application is from 0.025 to 5 kg per hectare, preferably from 0.05 to 1 kg per hectare.<br>
In addition, the compounds of the invention can be applied to plants or parts thereof which have been genetically modified to exhibit a trait such as fungal, insect, and/or herbicidal resistance.<br>
The compounds of formula I may be obtained by reacting a compound of formula II, or its hydrochloride salt, with a compound of formula III according to Scheme 1, where X is a leaving group such as halogen. When L is -(C = O)- or -SO2.<br>
preferred reaction conditions comprise mixing II with the corresponding benzoyl or sulfonyl chloride in the presence of triethylamine.<br><br>

Ra and Rb, which may be the same or different, are alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl,<br>
cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, heterocyclyl or phenyl, each of which may be substituted (preferably optionally substituted phenyl) or hydrogen;<br>
E1 is both an electron withdrawing group and a group which may be replaced by hydrogen using methodology known to the skilled chemist in accordance with step c) (preferably a carboxy group or a carboxy ester group);<br>
X1 is a leaving group (preferably halogen); and<br>
A1 and R1 are as defined above for the first aspect of the invention.<br>

Compounds of formula IV are known or can be prepared in known manner.<br>
Intermediates VI and VII may be isolated. Alternatively they may be generated in situ and the subsequent reaction step performed without isolation or purification. It is preferred that intermediate VI is generated in situ, whereas it is preferred that<br>
intermediate VII is isolated.<br>
Throughout this specification, unless the context requires otherwise, the word "comprise", or variations such as "comprises" or "comprising", will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or group of integers, but not the exclusion of any other integer or group of integers, including method steps.<br>
