				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to a process for producing a low density detergent composition by controlling agglomeration via particle size. More particularly, the invention is directed to a process during which low density detergent agglomerates are produced by feeding a surfactant paste or liquid acid precursor of anionic surfactant and dry starting detergent material sequentially into two high speed mixers followed by a fluid bed dryer. The process produces a free flowing, low density detergent composition which can be commercially sold as a conventional non-compact detergent composition or used as an admix in a low dosage, "compact" detergent product.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Recently, there has been considerable interest within the detergent industry for laundry detergents which are "compact" and therefore, have low dosage volumes. To facilitate production of these so-called low dosage detergents, many attempts have been made to produce high bulk density detergents, for example with a density of 600 g/1 or higher. The low dosage detergents are currently in high demand as they conserve resources and can be sold in small packages which are more convenient for consumers. However, the extent to which modern detergent products need to be "compact" in nature remains unsettled. In fact, many consumers, especially in developing countries, continue to prefer a higher dosage levels in their respective laundering operations. Consequently, there is a need in the art of producing modern detergent compositions for flexibility in the ultimate density of the final composition.<br>
Generally, there are two primary types of processes by which detergent granules or powders can be prepared. The first type of process involves spray-drying an aqueous detergent slurry in a spray-drying tower to produce highly porous detergent granule's. In the second type of process, the various detergent components are dry mixed after which they are agglomerated with a binder such as a nonionic or anionic surfactant. In both processes, the most important factors which govern the density of the resulting detergent granules are the density, porosity and surface area, shape of the various starting materials and their respective chemical composition. These parameters, however, can only be varied within a limited range. Thus, flexibility in the substantial bulk density can only be achieved by additional processing steps which lead to lower density of the detergent granules.<br><br>
There have been many attempts in the art for providing processes which increase the density of detergent granules or powders. Particular attention has been given to densification of spray-dried granules by post tower treatment. For example, one attempt involves a batch process in which spray-dried or granulated detergent powders containing sodium tripolyphosphate and sodium sulfate are densified and spheronized in a Marumerizer®. This apparatus comprises a substantially horizontal, roughened, rotatable table positioned within and at the base of a substantially vertical, smooth walled cylinder. This process, however, is essentially a batch process and is therefore less suitable for the large scale production of detergent powders. More recently, other attempts have been made to provide continuous processes for increasing the density of "post-tower" or spray dried detergent granules. Typically, such processes require a first apparatus which pulverizes or grinds the granules and a second apparatus which increases the density of the pulverized granules by agglomeration. While these processes achieve the desired increase in density by treating or densifying "post tower" or spray dried granules, they do not provide a process which has the flexibility of providing lower density granules using an agglomeration process or other non-tower process.<br>
Moreover, all of the aforementioned processes are directed primarily for densifying or otherwise processing spray dried granules. Currently, the relative amounts and types of materials subjected to spray drying processes in the production of detergent granules has been limited. For example, it has been difficult to attain high levels of surfactant in the resulting detergent composition, a feature which facilitates production of detergents in a more efficient manner. Thus, it would be desirable to have a process by which detergent compositions can be produced without having the limitations imposed by conventional spray drying techniques.<br>
To that end, the art is also replete with disclosures of processes which entail agglomerating detergent compositions. For example, attempts have been made to agglomerate detergent builders by mixing zeolite and/or layered silicates in a mixer to form free flowing agglomerates. While such attempts suggest that their process can be used to produce detergent agglomerates, they do not provide a mechanism by which conventional starting detergent materials in the form of surfactant pastes or precursors thereof, liquids and dry materials can be effectively agglomerated into crisp, free flowing detergent agglomerates having low densities rather than high densities. In the past, attempts at producing such low density agglomerates involves a nonconventional detergent ingredient which is typically expensive, thereby adding to the cost of the detergent product. One such example of this involves a process of agglomerating with inorganic double salts such as Burkeite to produce the desired low density agglomerates.<br><br>
Accordingly, there remains a need in the art to have a process for producing a low density detergent composition directly from starting detergent ingredients without the need for relatively expensive specialty ingredients. Also, there remains a need for such a process which is more efficient, flexible and economical to facilitate large-scale production of detergents of low as well as high dosage levels.<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention meets the aforementioned needs in the art by providing a process which produces a low density (below about 600 g/1) detergent composition directly from starting ingredients without the need for certain relatively expensive specialty ingredients. The process does not use the conventional spray drying towers currently used and is therefore more efficient, economical and flexible with regard to the variety of detergent compositions which can be produced in the process. Moreover, the process is more amenable to environmental concerns in that it does not use spray drying towers which typically emit particulates and volatile organic compounds into the atmosphere. In essence, the process involves agglomerating a surfactant paste or precursor thereof and dry detergent ingredients in a high speed mixer followed by another high speed mixer to form agglomerates which have been built-up or glued together via controlled particle si2e growth such that the resulting agglomerates are highly porous and have a very low density. The built-up low density agglomerates are further agglomerated in this fashion and dried in a fluid bed dryer to produce the final low density detergent agglomerates.<br>
As used herein, the term "agglomerates" refers to particles formed by agglomerating detergent granules or particles which typically have a smaller median particle size than the formed agglomerates. All percentages used herein are expressed as "percent-by-weight" on an anhydrous basis unless indicated otherwise.<br><br>
In accordance with one aspect of the invention, a process for preparing low density detergent agglomerates is provided. The process comprises the steps of: (a) agglomerating a detergent surfactant paste or precursor thereof and dry starting detergent material having a median particle size in a range from about 5 microns to about 70 microns in a first high speed mixer to obtain detergent agglomerates having a median particle size of from about 100 microns to about 250 microns; (b) mixing the detergent agglomerates with a first binder in a second high speed mixer to obtain built-up agglomerates having a median particle size in a range of from about 140 microns to about 350 microns; and (c) feeding the built-up agglomerates into a fluid bed dryer in which the built-up agglomerates are agglomerated with a second binder and dried to form detergent agglomerates having a median particle size in a range of from about 300 microns to about 700 microns and a density in a range from about 300 g/1 to about 550 g/1.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the invention, another process for preparing low density detergent agglomerates is provided. The process comprises the steps of: (a) agglomerating a first liquid acid precursor of an anionic surfactant and dry starting detergent material having a median particle size in a range from about 5 microns to about 50 Jnicrons in a first high speed mixer to obtain detergent agglomerates having a median "particle size of from about IQfr microns to about £§0 microns; (b) mixing the detergent agglomerates with a second liquid acid precursor of an anionic surfactant in a second high<br>
speed mixer to obtain built-up agglomerates having a median particle size in a range of<br>
 from about  l40 microns to about 350 microns; and (c) feeding the built-up agglomerates<br>
into a fluid bed dryer in which the built-up agglomerates are agglomerated with a third liquid acid precursor of an anionic surfactant and dried to form detergent agglomerates<br>
having a median particle size in a range of from about 300 microns to about 700 microns<br>
 and a density in a range from about 300 g/1 to about 550 g/1. The detergent products made<br>
in accordance with any of the process embodiments described herein are also provided.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide a process for producing a low density detergent composition directly from starting detergent ingredients which does not include relatively expensive specialty ingredients. It is also an object of the invention to provide such a process which is more efficient, flexible and economical so as to facilitate large-scale production of detergents of low as well as high dosage levels. These and other objects, features and attendant advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from a reading of the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment and the appended claims.<br><br>
STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a process for preparing a low density detergent composition by controlling agglomeration via particle size which comprises steps of:<br>
(a)	agglomerating a detergent surfactant paste or precursor<br>
thereof such as hereinbefore described and dry starting<br>
detergent material such as hereinbefore described having a<br>
median particle size in a range from 5 microns to 70.microns<br>
in a first high speed mixer to obtain agglomerates having a<br>

(b)	mixing said detergent agglomerates with a first binder such<br>
as hereinbefore described in a high speed mixer to obtain<br>
built-up agglomerates having a median particle size in a<br>

particle size in a range of from  300 microns to 700 microns<br>
and a density in a range from  300 g/1 to 550 g/1.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
The present invention is directed to a process in which low density agglomerates are produced by controlling the median particle size of the detergent ingredients in every<br><br>
step of the process. By "median particle size", it is meant the particle size diameter value above which 50% of the particles have a larger particle size and below which 50% of particles have a smaller particle size. The process forms free flowing, low density detergent agglomerates which can be used alone as the detergent product or as an admixture with conventional spray-dried detergent granules and/or high density detergent agglomerates in a final commercial detergent product. It should be understood that the process described herein can be operated continuously or in a batch mode depending upon the particularly desired application. One major advantage of the present process is that it utilizes equipment currently used to make high density or compact detergent products. However, the process described herein produces low density detergent compositions from such similar equipment by selectively adjusting and modifying certain unit operations and parameters as detailed herein. In this way, a single large-scale commercial detergent manufacturing facility can be built to produce high or low density detergent compositions depending upon the local consumer demand and its inevitable fluctuations between compact and non-compact detergent products.<br>
Process<br>
In the first step of the process, a detergent surfactant paste or precursor thereof as set forth in more detail hereinafter and dry starting detergent material having a selected median particle size is inputted and agglomerated in a high speed mixer. Unlike previous processes in this area, the dry starting material can include only those relatively inexpensive detergent materials typically used in modern granular detergent products. Such ingredients, include but are not limited to, builders, fillers, dry surfactants, and flow aides. Preferably, the builder includes aluminosilicates, crystalline layered silicates, phosphates, carbonates and mixtures thereof which is the essential dry starting detergent ingredient within the scope of the current process. Relatively expensive materials such as Burkeite (Na2SO4*Na2CC&gt;3) and the various silicas are not necessary to achieve the desired low density agglomerates produced by the process. Rather, it has been found that by judiciously controlling the median particle size of the inputted dry materials, particle build¬up can be achieved in manner which produces agglomerates having a high degree 6f "intraparticle" or "intragranule" or "intraagglomerate" porosity, and therefore are low in density. The terms "intraparticle" or "intragranule" or "intraagglomerate" are used synonmously herein to refer to the porosity or void space inside the formed built-up agglomerates produced at any stage of the process.<br>
Accordingly, in the first step of the process, the median particle size of the dry detergent material is preferably in a range from about 5 microns to about 70 microns, more preferably from about 10 microns to about 60 microns, and most preferably from about 10 microns to about 50 microns. It is also preferable to include from 1% to about 40% by<br><br>
vveight of recycled undersized detergent particles or "fines" in the first step of the process. This can be conveniently accomplished by screening the detergent particles formed subsequent to the fluid bed dryer to a median particle size range of from about 10 microns to about 150 microns and feeding these "fines" back into the first high speed mixer.<br>
The high speed mixer can be any one of a variety of commercially available mixers such as a Lodige CB 30 mixer or similar brand mixer. These types of mixers essentially consist of a horizontal, hollow static cylinder having a centrally mounted rotating shaft around which several shovel and rod-shaped blades are attached which have a tip speed of from about 5 m/s to about 30 m/s, more preferably from about 6 m/s to about 26 m/s. At the scale of a Lodige CB 30, the shaft rotates at a speed of from about 100 rpm to about 2500 rpm, more preferably from about 300 rpm to about 1600 rpm. At other mixer scales, the preferred rotation speed is adjusted to maintain tool tip speed equivalent to that of the Lodige CB 30. The tip speed is calculated by multiplying the radius from the center of the shaft to the tool tip by 27iN, wherein N is the rotation speed. Preferably, the mean residence time of the detergent ingredients in the high speed mixer is preferably in range from about 2 seconds to about 45 seconds, and most preferably from about 5 seconds to about 15 seconds. This mean residence time is conveniently measured by dividing the weight of the mixer at steady state by throughput (kg/hr) flow. Another suitable mixer is any one of the various Flexomix models available from Schugi (Netherlands) which are vertically positioned high speed mixers. This type of mixer is preferably operated at a Froude Index of from about 13 to about 32. See U.S. Patent 5,149,455 to Jacobs et al (issued September 22, 1992) for a detailed discussion of this well-known Froude Index which is a dimensionless number that can be optimally selected by those skilled in the art.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the process invention, a liquid acid precursor of an anionic surfactant is inputted with the dry starting detergent material which at least includes a neutralizing agent such as sodium carbonate. The preferred liquid acid surfactant precursor is C11-18linear alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant ("HLAS"), although any acid precursor of an anionic surfactant may be used in the process. A more preferred embodiment involves feeding a liquid acid precursor of C12 -14 linear alkylbenzerie sulfonate surfactant with a C10-18 alkyl ethoxylated sulfate ("AES") surfactant into the first high speed mixer, preferably in a weight ratio of from about 5:1 to about 1:5, and most preferably, in a range of from about 1:1 to about 3:1 (HLAS:AS). The result of such mixing is a "dry neutralization" reaction between the HLAS and the sodium carbonate embodied in the dry starting detergent material, all of which forms agglomerates. It is preferable to add the HLAS before the addition of other surfactants such as AES or alkyl sulfate ("AS") surfactants so as to insure optimal mixing and neutralization of the HLAS in the first high speed mixer. Preferably, after agglomeration in the first high speed mixer,<br><br>
detergent agglomerates having a median particle size of from about 100 microns to about 250 microns, more preferably from about 80 microns to about 140 microns, and most preferably from about 90 microns to about 120 microns, are formed.<br>
The rate of particle size growth can be controlled in a variety of ways, including but not limited to, varying the residence time, temperature and mixing tool speed of the mixer, and controlling amount of liquid or binder inputted into the mixer. In this regard, the particular parameter controlled is not critical, but only that the median particle size falls within the ranges set forth previously. In this way, the smaller particle sized starting detergent material is gradually built-up in a controlled fashion such that.the agglomerates have a large degree of intragranule porosity, thereby resulting in a low density detergent composition. Stated differently, the smaller sized starting detergent material is gently "glued" or "stuck" together to form porous built-up agglomerates, all of which is controlled so as to retain or increase the porosity by solidifying the particle bonds without consolidation or collapse of the agglomerates.<br>
In the second step of the process, the detergent agglomerates formed in the first step are inputted into a second high speed mixer and agglomerated with a atomized liquid binder. The second high speed mixer can be the same piece of equipment as used in the first step or a different type of high speed mixer. For example, a Lodige CB mixer can be used in the first step while a Schugi mixer is used in the second step. In this second process step, the agglomerates having a median particle size as noted previously are mixed and built-up further in a controlled fashion such that detergent agglomerates exiting the second high speed mixer have a median particle size of from about 140 microns to about 350 microns, more preferably from about 160 microns to about 250 microns, and most preferably from about 180 microns to about 220 microns. As in the first step of the process, the agglomerates are agglomerated in a very controlled fashion such that they have a median particle size within the aforementioned ranges. Again, the intragranule porosity of the particles is increased by "sticking" together smaller sized particles with a high degree of porosity between the particles (i.e., interparticle porosity). In this step, this is achieved by operating the high speed mixer with sufficient binder atomization and spray coverage to produce only agglomerates in the aforementioned median particle size ranges. In this regard, an appropriate binder is added to facilitate formation of the desired agglomerates in this step. Typical binders include liquid sodium silicate, a liquid acid precursor of an anionic surfactant such as HLAS, nonionic surfactant, polyethylene glycol or mixtures thereof.<br>
In the next step of the process, the built-up agglomerates are inputted into a fluid bed dryer in which the agglomerates are dried and agglomerated to a median particle size of from about 300 microns to about 700 microns, more preferably from about 325 microns to<br><br>
about 450 microns. The density of the agglomerates formed is from about 300 g/1 to about 550 g/1, more preferably from about 350 g/1 to about 500 g/1, and even more preferably from about 400 g/1 to about 480 g/1. All of these densities are generally below that of typical detergent compositions formed of dense agglomerates or most typical spray-dried granules. Preferably, in those process embodiments involving aqueous binders, the inlet air temperature of the fluid bed dryer is maintained in a range of from about 100°C to about 200°C so as to enhance formation of the desired agglomerates. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that this relatively high temperature insures rapid moisture evaporation to solidify the wet bonds of the built-up agglomerates so as to retain a high degree of intragranule porosity. As with the first and second steps of the process, the agglomerates are built-up from smaller sizes to large sized particles having a high degree of intragranule porosity. The degree of intragranule porosity is preferably from about 20% to about 40%, and most preferably from about 25% to about 35%. The intragranule porosity can be conveniently measured by standard mercury porosimetry testing.<br>
Optionally, a binder as described previously may be added during this step at more than one location such as at each end of the fluid bed dryer so to enhance formation of the desired agglomerates. The net result of this process embodiment involves addition of a binder in the second high speed mixer and at each end (i.e., the inlet port and exit port) of the fluid bed, thus totaling three binder addition points in the process which provides superior low density agglomerates. Particularly preferred binders in this regard are liquid sodium silicate and HLAS.<br>
Other optional steps contemplated by the present process include screening the oversized detergent agglomerates in a screening apparatus which can take a variety of forms including but not limited to conventional screens chosen for the desired particle size of the finished detergent product. Other optional steps include conditioning of the detergent agglomerates by subjecting the agglomerates to additional drying and/or cooling by way of apparatus discussed previously.<br>
Another optional step of the instant process entails finishing the resulting detergent agglomerates by a variety of processes including spraying and/or admixing other j conventional detergent ingredients. For example, the finishing step encompasses spraying perfumes, brighteners and enzymes onto the finished agglomerates to provide a more complete detergent composition. Such techniques and ingredients are well known in the art.<br>
Detergent Surfactant Paste or Surfactant Acid Precursor<br>
As mentioned, a liquid acid precursor of anionic surfactant is used in the first step of the process as well as in the second and third essential steps of the process as a binder. This liquid acid precursor will typically have a viscosity as measured at 30°C of from about<br><br>
500 cps to about 5,000 cps. The liquid acid is a precursor for the anionic surfactants described in more detail hereinafter. A detergent surfactant paste can also be used in the process and is preferably in the form of an aqueous viscous paste, although other forms are also contemplated by the invention. This so-called viscous surfactant paste has a viscosity of from about 5,000 cps to about 100,000 cps, more preferably from about 10,000 cps to about 80,000 cps, and contains at least about 10% water, more preferably at least about 20% water. The viscosity is measured at 70°C and at shear rates of about 10 to 100 sec.'l. Furthermore, the surfactant paste, if used, preferably comprises a detersive surfactant in the amounts specified previously and the balance water and other conventional detergent ingredients.<br>
The surfactant itself, in the viscous surfactant paste, is preferably selected from anionic, nonionic, zwitterionic, ampholytic and cationic classes and compatible mixtures thereof. Detergent surfactants useful herein are described in U.S. Patent 3,664,961, Norris, issued May 23, 1972, and in ITS. Patent 3,919,678, Laughlin et al., issued December 30, 1975, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. Useful cationic surfactants also include those described in U.S. Patent 4,222,905, Cockrell, issued September 16, 1980, and in U.S. Patent 4,239,659, Murphy, issued December 16, 1980, both of which are also incorporated herein by reference. Of the surfactants, anionics and nonionics are preferred and anionics are most preferred.<br>
Nonlimiting examples of the preferred anionic surfactants useful in the surfactant paste, or from which the liquid acid precursor described herein derives, include the conventional C11-C18 alkyl benzene sulfonates ("LAS"), primary, branched-chain and random C10-C20 alkyl sulfates ("AS"), the C10-C18  secondary (2,3) alkyl sulfates of the formula CH3(CH2)X(CHOSO3"M+) CH3 and CH3 (CH2)y(CHOSO3"M+) CH2CH3 . where x and (y + 1) are integers of at least about 7, preferably at least about 9, and M is a water-solubilizing cation, especially sodium, unsaturated sulfates such as oleyl sulfate, and the C10-C18 alkyl alkoxy sulfates ("AEXS"; especially EO 1-7 ethoxy sulfates).<br>
Optionally, other exemplary surfactants useful in the paste of the invention include and C10-C18  alkyl alkoxy carboxylates (especially the EO 1-5 ethoxycarboxylates), the C10-C18  glycerol ethers, the C10-C18 alkyl polyglycosides and their corresponding sulfated polyglycosides, and C12-C18 alpha-sulfonated fatty acid esters. If desired, the conventional nonionic and amphoteric surfactants such as the C12-C18  alkyl ethoxylates ("AE") including the so-called narrow peaked alkyl ethoxylates and C6-C12 alkyl phenol alkoxylates (especially ethoxylates and mixed ethoxy/propoxy), C12-C18  betaines and sulfobetaines ("sultaines"), C10-C18  amine oxides, and the like, can also be included in the overall compositions. The C10-C18  N-alkyl polyhydroxy fatty acid amides can also be used. Typical examples include the C12-C18  N-methylglucamides. See WO 9,206,154.<br><br>
Other sugar-derived surfactants include the N-alkoxy polyhydroxy fatty acid amides, such as C10-C18  N-(3-methoxypropyl) glucamide. The N-propyl through N-hexyl C12-C18 glucamides can be used for low sudsing. C10-C20 conventional soaps may also be used. If high sudsing is desired, the branched-chain C10-C16 soaps may be used. Mixtures of anionic and nonionic surfactants are especially useful. Other conventional useful surfactants are listed in standard texts.<br>
Dry Detergent Material<br>
The starting dry detergent material of the present process preferably comprises a builder and other standard detergent ingredients such as sodium carbonate, especially when a liquid acid precursor of a surfactant is used as it is needed as a neutralizing agent in the first step of the process. Thus, preferable starting dry detergent material includes sodium carbonate and a phosphate or an aluminosilicate builder which is referenced as an aluminosilicate ion exchange material. A preferred builder is selected from the group consisting of aluminosilicates, crystalline layered silicates, phosphates, carbonates and mixtures thereof. Preferred phosphate builders include sodium tripolyphosphate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate and mixtures thereof. Additional specific examples of inorganic phosphate builders are sodium and potassium tripolyphosphate, pyrophosphate, polymeric metaphosphate having a degree of polymerization of from about 6 to 21, and orthophosphates. Examples of polyphosphonate builders are the sodium and potassium salts of ethylene diphosphonic acid, the sodium and potassium salts of ethane 1 -hydroxy-1, 1-diphosphonic acid and the sodium and potassium salts of ethane, 1,1,2-triphosphonic acid. Other phosphorus builder compounds are disclosed in U.S. Patents 3,159,581; 3,213,030; 3,422,021; 3,422,137; 3,400,176 and 3,400,148, all of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The aluminosilicate ion exchange materials used herein as a detergent builder preferably have both a high calcium ion exchange capacity and a high exchange rate. Without intending to be limited by theory, it is believed that such high calcium ion exchange rate and capacity are a function of several interrelated factors which derive from the method by which the aluminosilicate ion exchange material is produced. In that regard, the aluminosilicate ion exchange materials used herein are preferably produced in accordance with Corkill et al, U.S. Patent No. 4,605,509 (Procter &amp; Gamble), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Preferably, the aluminosilicate ion exchange material is in "sodium" form since the potassium and hydrogen forms of the instant aluminosilicate do not exhibit the as high of an exchange rate and capacity as provided by the sodium form. Additionally, the aluminosilicate ion exchange material preferably is in over dried form so as to facilitate production of crisp detergent agglomerates as described herein. The aluminosilicate ion<br><br>
exchange materials used herein preferably have particle size diameters which optimize their effectiveness as detergent builders. The term "particle size diameter" as used herein represents the average particle size diameter of a given aluminosilicate ion exchange material as determined by conventional analytical techniques, such as microscopic determination and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The preferred particle size diameter of the aluminosilicate is from about 0.1 micron to about 10 microns, more preferably from about 0.5 microns to about 9 microns. Most preferably, the particle size diameter is from about 1 microns to about 8 microns.<br>
Preferably, the aluminosilicate ion exchange material has the formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein z and y are integers of at least 6, the molar ratio of z to y is from about 1 to about 5 and x is from about 10 to about 264. More preferably, the aluminosilicate has the formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein x is from about 20 to about 30, preferably about 27. These preferred aluminosilicates are available commercially, for example under designations Zeolite A, Zeolite B and Zeolite X. Alternatively, naturally-occurring or synthetically derived aluminosilicate ion exchange materials suitable for use herein can be made as described in Krummel et al, U.S. Patent No. 3,985,669, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The aluminosilicates used herein are further characterized by their ion exchange capacity which is at least about 200 mg equivalent of CaCO3 hardness/gram, calculated on an anhydrous basis, and which is preferably in a range from about 300 to 352 mg equivalent of CaCO3 hardness/gram. Additionally, the instant aluminosilicate ion exchange materials are still further characterized by their calcium ion exchange rate which is at least about 2 grains Ca++/gallon/minute/-gram/gallon, and more preferably in a range from about 2 grains Ca++7gallon/minute/-grarn/gallon to about 6 grains Ca++/gallon/minute/-gram/gallon.<br>
Adjunct Detergent Ingredients<br>
The starting dry detergent material in the present process can include additional detergent ingredients and/or, any number of additional ingredients can be incorporated in the detergent composition during subsequent steps of the present process. These adjunct ingredients include other detergency builders, bleaches, bleach activators, suds boosters or suds suppressors, anti-tarnish and anticorrosion agents, soil suspending agents, soil release agents, germicides, pH adjusting agents, non-builder alkalinity sources, chelating agents, smectite clays, enzymes, enzyme-stabilizing agents and perfumes. See U.S. Patent<br><br>
3,936,537, issued February 3, 1976 to Baskerville, Jr. et al., incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Other builders can be generally selected from the various borates, polyhydroxy sulfonates, polyacetates, carboxylates, citrates, tartrate mono- and di-succinates, and mixtures thereof. Preferred are the alkali metal, especially sodium, salts of the above. In comparison with amorphous sodium silicates, crystalline layered sodium silicates exhibit a clearly increased calcium and magnesium ion exchange capacity. In addition, the layered sodium silicates prefer magnesium ions over calcium ions, a feature necessary to insure that substantially all of the "hardness" is removed from the wash water. These crystalline layered sodium silicates, however, are generally more expensive than amorphous silicates as well as other builders. Accordingly, in order to provide an economically feasible laundry detergent, the proportion of crystalline layered sodium silicates used must be determined judiciously.<br>
The crystalline layered sodium silicates suitable for use herein preferably have the formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein M is sodium or hydrogen, x is from about 1.9 to about 4 and y is from about 0 to about 20. More preferably, the crystalline layered sodium silicate has the formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein M is sodium or hydrogen, and y is from about 0 to about 20. These and other crystalline layered sodium silicates are discussed in Corkill et al, U.S. Patent No. 4,605,509, previously incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Examples of nonphosphorus, inorganic builders are tetraborate decahydrate and silicates having a weight ratio of SiO2 to alkali metal oxide of from about 0.5 to about 4.0, preferably from about 1.0 to about 2.4. Water-soluble, nonphosphorus organic builders useful herein include the various alkali metal, ammonium and substituted ammonium polyacetates, carboxylates, polycarboxylates and polyhydroxy sulfonates. Examples of polyacetate and polycarboxylate builders are the sodium, potassium, lithium, ammonium and substituted ammonium salts of ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid, nitrilotriacetic acid, oxydisuccinic acid, mellitic acid, benzene polycarboxylic acids, and citric acid.<br>
Polymeric polycarboxylate builders are set forth in U.S. Patent 3,308,067, Diehl, issued March 7, 1967, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Such materials include the water-soluble salts of homo- and copolymers of aliphatic carboxylic acids such as maleic acid, itaconic acid, mesaconic acid, fumaric acid, aconitic acid, citraconic acid and methylene malonic acid. Some of these materials are useful as the water-soluble anionic polymer as hereinafter described, but only if in intimate admixture with the non-soap anionic surfactant.<br><br>
Other suitable polycarboxylates for use herein are the polyacetal carboxylates described in U.S. Patent 4,144,226, issued March 13, 1979 to Crutchfield et al, and U.S. Patent 4,246,495, issued March 27, 1979 to Crutchfield et al, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. These polyacetal carboxylates can be prepared by bringing together under polymerization conditions an ester of glyoxylic acid and a polymerization initiator. The resulting polyacetal carboxylate ester is then attached to chemically stable end groups to stabilize the polyacetal carboxylate against rapid depolymerization in alkaline solution, converted to the corresponding salt, and added to a detergent composition. Particularly preferred polycarboxylate builders are the ether carboxylate builder compositions comprising a combination of tartrate monosuccinate and tartrate disuccinate described in U.S. Patent 4,663,071, Bush et al., issued May 5, 1987, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Bleaching agents and activators are described in U.S. Patent 4,412,934, Chung et al, issued November 1, 1983, and in U.S. Patent 4,483,781, Hartman, issued November 20, 1984, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. Chelating agents are also described in U.S. Patent 4,663,071, Bush et al., from Column 17, line 54 through Column 18, line 68, incorporated herein by reference. Suds modifiers are also optional ingredients and are described in U.S. Patents 3,933,672, issued January 20, 1976 to Bartoletta et al., and 4,136,045, issued January 23, 1979 to Gault et al., both incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Suitable smectite clays for use herein are described in U.S. Patent 4,762,645, Tucker et al, issued August 9, 1988, Column 6, line 3 through Column 7, line 24, incorporated herein by reference. Suitable additional detergency builders for use herein are enumerated in the Baskerville patent, Column 13, line 54 through Column 16, line 16, and in U.S. Patent 4,663,071, Bush et al, issued May 5, 1987, both incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In order to make the present invention more readily understood, reference is made to the following example, which is intended to be illustrative only and not intended to be limiting in scope.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
This Example illustrates the process invention in which a low density agglomerated detergent composition is prepared. A Lodige CB 30 high speed mixer is charged with a mixture of powders, namely sodium carbonate (median particle size 15 microns) and sodium tripolyphosphate ("STPP") with a median particle size of 25 microns. A liquid acid precursor of sodium alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant (C12H25-C6H4-SO3-H or "HLAS" as noted below) and a C10-18  alkyl ethoxylated sulfate aqueous surfactant paste (EO = 3, 70% active "AES") are also inputted into the Lodige CB 30 mixer, wherein<br><br>
the HLAS is added first. The mixer is operated at 1600 rpm and the sodium carbonate, STPP, HLAS and AES are formed into agglomerates having a median particle size of about 110 microns after a mean residence time in the Lodige CB 30 mixer of about 5 seconds. The agglomerates are then fed to a Schugi (Model # FX160) high speed mixer which is operated at 2800 rpms with a mean residence time of about 2 seconds. A HLAS binder is inputted into the Schugi (Model # FX160) mixer during this step which results in built-up agglomerates having a median particle size of about 180 microns being formed. Thereafter, the built-up agglomerates are passed through a four-zone fluid bed dryer wherein two spray nozzles are positioned in the first and fourth zone of the fluid bed dryer. The fluid bed is operated at an air inlet temperature of about 125°C. In the amounts and particle size specified below, fines are also added to the Lodige CB 30 mixer. In the first and fourth zones of the fluid bed dryer, liquid sodium silicate is fed into the fluid bed dryer resulting in the finished detergent agglomerates having a density of about 485 g/1 and a median particle size of about 360 microns. Unexpectedly, the finished agglomerates have excellent physical properties in that they are free flowing as exhibited by their superior cake strength grades.<br>
The composition of the agglomerates are given below in Table I.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The agglomerates embody about 14% of the fines (less than 150 microns) mentioned previously which are recycled from the fluid bed back into the Lodige CB 30 to enhance production of the agglomerates produced by the process.<br>
Having thus described the invention in detail, it will be clear to those skilled in the art that various changes may be made without departing from the scope of the invention and the invention is not to be considered limited to what is described in the specification.<br><br><br><br><br>
