				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to a low dosage detergent composition that has substantially improved flow properties. More particularly, the invention is directed to a detergent composition which contains optimum proportions of detergent agglomerates and spray dried granules to provide improved flow properties in that the composition has less tendency to "cake" before use. As a result, consumers may conveniently "scoop" or otherwise dispense low dosages of the composition into washing solutions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Recently, there has been considerable interest within the detergent industry for laundry detergents which are "compact" and therefore, have low dosage volumes. To facilitate production of these so-called low dosage detergents, many attempts have been made to produce high bulk density-detergents, for example with a density of 600 g/1 or higher. The low dosage detergents are currently in high demand as they conserve resources and can be sold in small packages which are more convenient for consumers, especially in households where there is a premium on storage space<br>
Generally, there are two primary types of processes by which detergent granules or powders can be prepared. The first type of process involves spray-drying an aqueous detergent slurry in a spray-drying tower to produce highly porous detergent granules. In the second type of process, the various detergent components are dry mixed just prior to agglomeration with a binder, such as a nonionic surfactant. In the former process, there has been difficulty in attaining high levels of surfactant in the resulting detergent composition, a feature which is necessary for low dosage detergent;;. More particularly, any increase in the density of granules produced by way of • conventional spray drying techniques is limited by the relative amount of surfactant required to be passed through the spray drying tower. Consequently, there is a limit or "ceiling" on the amount of surfactant: that can be delivered by a detergent product if it only contains spray dried granules. Moreover, spray dried granules which have high surfactant levels and/or are densified by grinding and/or compaction operations do not have favorable flow properties in that they have a tendency to "cake" while stored in the detergent box, especially under highly humid conditions. Such "caking" is very unacceptable to consumers and can lead to difficulties in "scooping" or otherwise removing the detergent from the box in which it is contained. This problem can also result in improper dosing of the laundering solution resulting in decreased cleaning performance.<br>
The art is also replete with disclosures of forming detergent agglomerates which typically are more dense and thus renders them suitable for low dosage detergent compositions. For example, the prior art discloses a process for preparing high density detergent agglomerates by using two mixers in series. In particular, an admix of starting detergent materials is fed into a high speed mixer/densifier after which the materials are fed into a moderate speed mixer/densifier to increase the bulk density further. The resulting detergent agglomerates are suitable for use in low dosage detergents since they are highly dense and contain increased levels of surfactant as compared to the aforementioned spray dried granules. However, low dosage detergent compositions made exclusively of agglomerates generally are not capable of delivering all of the conventional detergent ingredients necessary for a fully formulated, low dosage, modern detergent product.<br>
Accordingly, despite the above-described disclosures in the art, it would be desirable to have a detergent composition which has sufficient levels of surfactant for modern low dosage use and which exhibits improved flow properties. It would also be desirable for such a detergent composition to have increased cleaning performance.<br>

Patent No. 5,205,958.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention meets the needs identified above by providing a low dosage, highly dense detergent composition which exhibits improved flow properties in that it has less tendency to "cake" before use. Additionally, the detergent composition is very suitable for use as a modem compact or low dosage detergent product as it contains high surfactant amounts. The detergent composition contains optimum proportions of spray dried granules and agglomerates unexpectedly resulting in a composition having the aforementioned benefits. Adjunct detergent ingredients are also included to provide a modern fully formulated detergent composition.<br>
As used herein, the term "agglomerates" refers to particles formed by agglomerating more porous starting detergent ingredients (particles) which typically have a smaller mean particle size than the formed agglomerates. AH percentages and ratios used herein are expressed as percentages by weight (anhydrous basis) unless otherwise indicated.<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the invention, a low dosage, highly dense detergent product is provided. The detergent composition comprises: (a) from about 40% to about 80% by weight of spray dried detergent granules; (b) from about 20% to about 60% by weight of detergent agglomerates having a density of at least about 700 g/1; and (c) from about 1% to about 20% by<br>
weight of adjunct ingredients. The weight ratio of the granules to the agglomerates is from about 3:1 to about 1:3 and the composition has a density of at least about 650 g/l.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, a more preferred low dosage detergent composition is provided. The detergent composition comprises: (a) from about 45% to about 55% by weight of spray dried detergent granules including, by weight of the granules, (i) from about 10% to about 30% of a surfactant system selected from the group consisting of anionics, nonionics and mixtures thereof; (ii) from about 20% to about 30% of aluminosilicate; (iii) from about 20% to about 30% of sodium carbonate; and (iv) the balance water and conventional detergency ingredients; (b) from about 35% to about 45% by weight of detergent agglomerates including, by weight of the agglomerates, (i) from about 25% to about 40% of a mixture of alkyl sulfate surfactant and linear alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant; (ii) from about 35% to about 45% of aluminosilicate; (iii) from about 20% to about 30% of sodium carbonate; and, (iv) the balance water and conventional detergency ingredients; and (c) from about 5% to about 15% by weight of adjunct ingredients selected from the group consisting, of perfume, enzymes, soil release polymers, suds suppressors, pH adjusting agents, bleaching agents and mixtures thereof. The weight ratio of the granules to the agglomerates is about 3:2 and the composition has a density of at least about 650 g/l.<br>
The invention also provides a method of laundering soiled clothes comprising the step of contacting the soiled clothes with aqueous solution containing an effective amount of detergent composition as described herein.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide a detergent composition which has sufficient levels of surfactant for modern low dosage use and which exhibits improved flow properties. It is also an object of the invention to provide such a detergent composition which has increased cleaning performance. These and other objects, features and attendant advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from a reading of the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment and the appended claims.<br>

The composition also includes a selected amount of adjunct detergent ingredients. In this regard, the composition comprises from about 40% to about 80%, more preferably from about 40% to about 60%, and most preferably from about 45% to about 55%, by weight of spray dried granules.  Preferably, the composition includes from about 20% to about 60%, more preferably from about 30% to about 50%, and most preferably from about 35% to about 45%, by weight of agglomerates which have a density of at least 700 g/1, more preferably from about 700 g/1 to about 850 g/1.   The preferred weight ratio of granules to agglomerates is from about 3:1 to about 1:3, more preferably from about 1:1 to about 3:1, and most preferably about 3:2.<br>
The adjunct ingredients are preferably present in an amount from about 1% to about 20%, more preferably from about 5% to about 15%, and most preferably from about 10% to about 15%, by weight. A preferred set of adjunct ingredients includes perfume, enzymes, soil release polymers, suds suppressors, pH adjusting agents, brighteners, bleaching agents and mixtures thereof. It is also preferably that the adjunct ingredients include from about 0.1% to about 1% by weight of an enzyme selected from the group consisting of cellulase, protease, lipase and mixtures thereof. Another preferred inclusion of the adjunct ingredients is to include from about 0.1% to about 0.5% by weight of a soil release polymer. Preferably, agglomerates comprise a mixture of alkyl sulfate and linear alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactants (preferably in a 3:1 weight ratio), an aluminosilicate builder, sodium carbonate, polyethylene glycol and water. The adjunct ingredients also preferably comprise from about 0.1% to about 0.5% by weight of a suds suppressor.<br>
In another preferred composition, the spray dried granules include, by weight of the granules, from about 10% to about 30%, more preferably from about 15% to about 20%, of a surfactant system selected from the group consisting of anionics, nonionics and mixtures thereof.

The agglomerates also comprise from about 35% to about 45% of aluminosilicate, from about 20% to about 30% of sodium carbonate, and the balance water and conventional or other adjunct detergency ingredients.<br>
Detersive Surfactant<br>
The granules and/or the agglomerates include surfactants at the levels stated previously. The detersive surfactant can be selected from the group consisting of anionic surfactants, nonionic surfactants, cationic surfactants, zwitterionic surfactants and mixtures. Nonlimiting examples of surfactants useful herein include the conventional C11-C18 alkyl benzene sulfonates ("LAS") and primary, branched-chain and random C10-C20 alkyl sulfates ("AS"), the C10-C18 secondary (2,3) alkyl sulfates of the formula CH3(CH2)X(CHOSO3~M+) CH3 and CH3 (CH2)y(CHOSO3~M+) CH2CH3 where x and (y + 1) are integers of at least about 7, preferably at least about 9, and M is a water-solubilizing cation, especially sodium, unsaturated sulfates such as oleyl sulfate, the Cj0-C[g alkyl alkoxy sulfates ("AEXS"; especially EO 1-7 ethoxy sulfates), C10-C18 alkyl alkoxy carboxylates (especially the EO 1-5 ethoxycarboxylates), the C10-18glycerol ethers, the C10-C18 alkyl polyglycosides and their corresponding sulfated polyglycosides, and C 12-C 18 alpha-sulfonated fatty acid esters. If desired, the conventional nonionic and amphoteric surfactants such as the C12-C18 alkyl ethoxylates ("AE") including the so-called narrow peaked alkyl ethoxylates and C6-C12 alkyl phenol alkoxylates (especially ethoxylates and mixed ethoxy/propoxy), C12-C18 betaines and sulfobetaines ("sultaines"), C10-C18 amine oxides, and the like, can also be included in the<br>
overall compositions. The C10-C18 N-alkyl polyhydroxy fatty acid amides can also be used. Typical examples include the C 12-C18 N-methylglucamides. See WO 9,206,154. Other sugar-derived surfactants include the N-alkoxy polyhydroxy fatty acid amides, such as C10-C18 N-(3-methoxypropyl) glucamide. The N-propyl through N-hexyl C12-C18 glucamides can be used for low sudsing. C10-C20 conventional soaps may also be used. If high sudsing is desired, the branched-chain C10-C16 soaps may be used. Mixtures of anionic and nonionic surfactants are especially useful. Other conventional useful surfactants are listed in standard texts.<br>
The C10-C18 alkyl alkoxy sulfates ("AEXS"; especially EO 1-7 ethoxy sulfates) and C 12-C18 alkyl ethoxylates ("AE") are the most preferred for the cellulase-containing detergents described herein.<br>
Detersive Builder<br>
The granules and agglomerates preferably include a builder at the previously stated levels. To that end, inorganic as well as organic builders can be used. Also, crystalline as well as amorphous builder materials can be used. Builders are typically used in fabric laundering compositions to assist in the removal of paniculate soils.<br>
Inorganic or P-containing detergent builders include, but are not limited to, the alkali metal, ammonium and alkanolammonium salts of polyphosphates (exemplified by the tripolyphosphates, pyrophosphates, and glassy polymeric meta-phosphates), phosphonates, phytic acid, silicates, carbonates (including bicarbonates and sesquicarbonates), sulphates, and aluminosilicates. However, non-phosphate builders are required in some locales. Importantly, the compositions herein function surprisingly well even in the presence of the so-called "weak" builders (as compared with phosphates) such as citrate, or in the so-called "under built" situation that may occur with zeolite or layered silicate builders.<br>
Examples of silicate builders are the alkali metal silicates, particularly those having a SiO2:Na2O ratio in the range 1.6:1 to 3.2:1 and layered silicates, such as the layered sodium silicates described in U.S. Patent 4,664,839, issued May 12, 1987 to H. P. Rieck. NaSKS-6 is the trademark for a crystalline layered silicate marketed by Hoechst (commonly abbreviated herein as "SKS-6"). Unlike zeolite builders, the Na SKS-6 silicate builder does not contain aluminum. NaSKS-6 has the delta-Na2SiO5 morphology form of layered silicate. It can be prepared by methods such as those described in German DE-A-3,417,649 and DE-A-3,742,043. SKS-6 is a highly preferred layered silicate for use herein, but other such layered silicates, such as those having the general formula NaMSixO2x+i'yH2O wherein M is sodium or hydrogen, x is a number from 1.9 to 4, preferably 2, and y is a number from 0 to 20, preferably 0 can be used herein. Various other layered silicates from Hoechst include NaSKS-5, NaSKS-7 and NaSKS-11, as the alpha, beta and gamma forms. As noted above, the delta-Na2SiO5 (NaSKS-6 form) is most preferred for use herein. Other silicates may also be useful such as for example magnesium silicate, which can serve as a crispening agent in granular formulations, as a stabilizing agent for oxygen bleaches, and as a component of suds control systems.<br>
as well as polycarboxylates such as mellitic acid, succinic acid, oxydisuccinic acid, polymaleic acsc benzene 1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid, carboxymethyloxysuccinic acid, and soluble salts thereof.<br>
Citrate builders, e.g., citric acid and soluble salts thereof (particularly sodium salt), are polycarboxylate builders of particular importance for heavy duty liquid detergent formulations due their availability from renewable resources and their biodegradability. Citrates can also be used in granular compositions, especially in combination with aeolite and/or layered silicate builders. Oxydisuccinates are also especially useful in such compositions and combinations.<br>
Also suitable in the detergent compositions of the present invention are the 3,3-dicarboxy oxa-1,6-hexanedioates and the related compounds disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,566,984, Bush, issuec January 28, 1986. Useful succinic acid builders include the C5-C20 alkyl and alkenyl succinic aci and salts thereof. A particularly preferred compound of this type is dodecenylsuccinic acid. Speci examples of succinate builders include: laurylsuccinate, myristylsuccinate, palmitylsuccinate, 2-dodecenylsuccinate (preferred), 2-pentadecenylsuccinate, and the like. Laurylsuccinates are the preferred builders of this group, and are described in European Patent Application 86200690.5/0,200,263, published November 5, 1986.<br>
Other suitable polycarboxylates are disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,144,226, Crutchfield et al. issued March 13, 1979 and in U.S. Patent 3,308,067, Diehl, issued March 7, 1967, See also Diehl U.S. Patent 3,723,322.<br>
Fatty acids, e.g., C^-Cjg monocarboxylic acids, can also be incorporated into the compositions alone, or in combination with the aforesaid builders, especially citrate and/or the succinate builders, to provide additional builder activity. Such use of fatty acids will generally res in a diminution of sudsing, which should be taken into account by the formulator.<br>
In situations where phosphorus-based builders can be used, and especially in the formulation of bars used for hand-laundering operations, the various alkali metal phosphates such as well-known- sodium tripolyphosphates, sodium pyrophosphate and sodium orthophosphate can be used. Phosphonate builders such as ethane-1 -hydroxy-1,1 -diphosphonate and other known phosphonates (see, for example, U.S. Patents 3,159,581; 3,213,030; 3,422,021; 3,400,148 and 3,422,137) can also be used.<br>
Adjunct Ingredients<br>
The composition of the invention preferably also includes adjunct detergent ingredients which can be included in the spray dried granules or in the agglomerates, and/or more typically, as separately added ingredients. While the levels may vary, the preferred levels are as stated previously.<br>
Enzymes<br>
One such adjunct ingredient are enzymes which can be included formulations herein for a wide variety of fabric laundering purposes, including removal of protein-based, carbohydrate-based, or triglyceride-based stains, for example, and for the prevention of refugee dye transfer, and for<br>
fabric restoration. The additional enzymes to be incorporated include cellulases, proteases, amylases, lipases, and peroxidases, as well as mixtures thereof. Other types of enzymes may also be included They may be of any suitable origin, such as vegetable, animal, bacterial, fungal and yeast origin. However, their choice is governed by several factors such as pH-activity and/or stability optima, thermostability, stability versus active detergents, builders as well as their potential to cause malodors during use. In this respect bacterial or fungal enzymes are preferred, such as bacterial amylases and proteases.<br>
Enzymes are normally incorporated at levels sufficient to provide up to about 5 mg by weight, more typically about 0.01 mg to about 3 mg, of active enzyme per gram of the composition. Stated otherwise, the compositions herein will typically comprise from about 0.001% to about 5%, preferably 0.01%-1% by weight of a commercial enzyme preparation. Protease enzymes are usually present in such commercial preparations, at levels sufficient to provide from 0.005 to 0.1 Anson units (AU) of activity per gram of composition.<br>
The cellulase suitable for the present invention include both bacterial or fungal cellulase. Preferably, they will have a pH optimum of between 5 and 9.5. Suitable cellulases are disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,435,307, Barbesgoard et al, issued March 6, 1984, which discloses fungal cellulase produced from Humicoia insolens and Humicoia strain DSM1800 or a cellulase 212-producing fungus belonging to the genus Aeromonas, and cellulase extracted from the hepatopancreas of a marine mollusk (Dolabella Auricula Solander), suitable cellulases are also disclosed in GB-A-2.075.028; GB-A-2.095.275 and DE-OS-2.247.832. In addition, cellulase especially suitable for use herein are disclosed in WO 92-13057 (Procter &amp; Gamble)   Most preferably, the cellulases used in the instant detergent compositions are purchased commercially from NOVO Industries A/S under the product names CAREZYME® and CELLUZYME®.<br>
Suitable examples of proteases are the subtilisins which are obtained from particular strains of B. subtilis and B. licheniforms. Another suitable protease is obtained from a strain of Bacillus, having maximum activity throughout the pH range of 8-12, developed and sold by Novo Industries A/S under the registered trade name ESPERASE. The preparation of this enzyme and analogous enzymes is described in British Patent Specification No. 1,243,784 of Novo. Proteolytic enzymes suitable for removing protein-based stains that are commercially available include those sold under the trade names ALCALASE and SAVINASE by Novo Industries A/S (Denmark) and MAXATASE by International Bio-Synthetics, Inc. (The Netherlands). Other proteases include Protease A (see European Patent Application 130,756, published January 9, 1985) and Protease B (see European Patent Application Serial No. 87303761.8, filed April 28, 1987, and European Patent Application 130,756, Bott et al, published January 9, 1985).<br>
Amylases include, for example, a-amylases described in British Patent Specification No. 1,296,839 (Novo), RAPIDASE, International Bio-Synthetics, Inc. and TERMAMYL, Novo Industries.<br>
Suitable lipase enzymes for detergent usage include those produced by microorganisms of the Pseudomonas group, such as Pseudomonas stutzeri ATCC 19.154. as disclosed in British Patent 1,372,034. See also lipases in Japanese Patent Application 53,20487, laid open to public inspection on February 24, 1978. This lipase is available from Amano Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Nagoya, Japan, under the trade name Lipase P "Amano," hereinafter referred to as "Amano-P."

The LIPOLASE enzyme derived from Humicola lanuginosa and commercially available from Novo (see also EPO 341,947) is a preferred lipase for use herein.<br>
Peroxidase enzymes are used in combination with oxygen sources, e.g., percarbonate, perborate, persulfate, hydrogen peroxide, etc. They are used for "solution bleaching," i.e. to prevent transfer of dyes or pigments removed from substrates during wash operations to other substrates in the wash solution. Peroxidase enzymes are known in the art, and include, for example, horseradish peroxidase, ligninase, and haloperoxidase such as chloro- and bromo-peroxidase. Peroxidase-containing detergent compositions are disclosed, for example, in PCT International Application WO 89/099813, published October 19, 1989, by O. Kirk, assigned to Novo Industries A/S.<br>

Polymeric Soil Release Agent<br>
Any polymeric soil release agent known to those skilled in the art can optionally be employed in the compositions and processes of this invention. Polymeric soil release agents are characterized by having both hydrophilic segments, to hydrophilize the surface of hydrophobic fibers, such as polyester and nylon, and hydrophobic segments, to deposit upon hydrophobic fibers and remain adhered thereto through completion of washing and rinsing cycles and, thus, serve as an anchor for the hydrophilic segments. This can enable stains occurring subsequent to treatment with the soil release agent to be more easily cleaned in later washing procedures.<br>
The polymeric soil release agents useful herein especially include those soil release agents having: (a) one or more nonionic hydrophile components consisting essentially of (i) polyoxyethylene segments with a degree of polymerization of at least 2, or (ii) oxypropylene or polyoxypropylene segments with a degree of polymerization of from 2 to 10, wherein said hydrophile segment does not encompass any oxypropylene unit unless it is bonded to adjacent moieties at each end by ether linkages, or (iii) a mixture of oxyalkylene units comprising oxyethylene and from 1 to about 30 oxypropylene units wherein said mixture contains a sufficient amount of oxyethylene units such that the hydrophile component has hydrophilicity great enough to increase the hydrophilicity of conventional polyester synthetic fiber surfaces upon deposit of the soil release agent on such surface, said hydrophile segments preferably comprising at least about 25% oxyethylene units and more preferably, especially for such components having about 20 to 30 oxypropylene units, at least about 50% oxyethylene units; or (b) one or more hydrophobe components comprising (i) €3 oxyalkylene terephthalate segments, wherein, if said hydrophobe components also comprise oxyethylene terephthalate, the ratio of oxyethylene terephthalate:C 5 oxyalkylene terephthalate units is about 2:1 or lower, (ii) C^-C^ alkylene or oxy C^Cg alkylene segments, or mixtures therein, (iii) poly (vinyl ester) segments, preferably polyvinyl acetate), having a degree of polymerization of at least 2, or (iv) €[-€4 alkyl ether or €4 hydroxyalkyl ether substituents, or mixtures therein, wherein said substituents are present in the form ofC^-C^ alkyl ether or €4 hydroxyalkyl ether cellulose derivatives, or mixtures therein, and such cellulose derivatives are amphiphilic, whereby they have a sufficient level of Cj-C4 alkyl ether and/or €4 hydroxyalkyl ether units to deposit upon conventional polyester synthetic fiber surfaces and retain a sufficient level of hydroxyls, once adhered to such conventional synthetic fiber surface, to increase fiber surface hydrophilicity, or a combination of (a) and (b).<br>
Typically, the polyoxyethylene segments of (a)(i) will have a degree of polymerization of from about 200, although higher levels can be used, preferably from 3 to about 150, more preferably from 6 to about 100.

Commercially available soil release agents of this kind include the SOKALAN type of material, e.g., SOKALAN HP-22, available from BASF (West Germany).<br>
One type of preferred soil release agent is a copolymer having random blocks of ethylene terephthalate and polyethylene oxide (PEO) terephthalate. The molecular weight of this polymeric soil release agent is in the range of from about 25.000 to about 55,000. See U.S. Patent 3,959,230 to Hays, issued May 25, 1976 and U.S. Patent 3,893,929 to Basadur issued July 8, 1975.<br>

reducing stabilizer, preferably selected from the group consisting of xylene sulfonate, cumene sulfonate, toluene sulfonate, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Suds Suppressors<br>
Compounds for reducing or suppressing the formation of suds can be incorporated into the compositions of the present invention. Suds suppression can be of particular importance in the so-called "high concentration cleaning process" and in front-loading European-style washing machines.<br>
A wide variety of materials may be used as suds suppressors, and suds suppressors are well known to those skilled in the art. See, for example, Kirk Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Third Edition, Volume 7, pages 430-447 (John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1979). One category of suds suppressor of particular interest encompasses monocarboxylic fatty acid and soluble salts therein. See U.S. Patent 2,954,347, issued September 27, 1960 to Wayne St. John. The monocarboxylic fatty acids and salts thereof used as suds suppressor typically have hydrocarbyl chains of 10 to about 24 carbon atoms, preferably 12 to 18 carbon atoms. Suitable salts include the alkali metal salts such as sodium, potassium, and lithium salts, and ammonium and alkanolammonium salts.<br>
The detergent compositions herein may also contain non-surfactant suds suppressors. These include, for example: high molecular weight hydrocarbons such as paraffin, fatty acid esters (e.g., fatty acid triglycerides), fatty acid esters of monovalent alcohols, aliphatic Cj§-C4g ketones (e.g. stearone), etc. Other suds inhibitors include N-alkylated amino triazines such as tri- to hexa-alkylmelamines or di- to tetra-alkyldiamine chlortriazines formed as products of cyanuric chloride with two or three moles of a primary or secondary amine containing 1 to 24 carbon atoms, propylene oxide, and monostearyl phosphates such as monostearyl alcohol phosphate ester and monostearyl di-alkali metal (e.g., K, Na, and Li) phosphates and phosphate esters. The hydrocarbons such as paraffin and halo paraffin can be utilized in liquid form. The liquid hydrocarbons will be liquid at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, and will have a pour point in the range of about -40°C and about 50°C, and a minimum boiling point not less than about 110°C (atmospheric pressure). It is also known to utilize waxy hydrocarbons, preferably having a melting point below about 100°C. The hydrocarbons constitute a preferred category of suds suppressor for detergent compositions. Hydrocarbon suds suppressors are described, for example, in U.S. Patent 4,265,779, issued May 5, 1981 to Gandolfo et al. The hydrocarbons, thus, include aliphatic, alicyclic, aromatic, and heterocyclic saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbons having from about 12 to about 70 carbon atoms. The term "paraffin," as used in this suds suppressor discussion, is intended to include mixtures of true paraffins and cyclic hydrocarbons.<br>
Another preferred category of non-surfactant suds suppressors comprises silicone suds suppressors. This category includes the use of polyorganosiloxane oils, such as polydimethyl-siloxane, dispersions or emulsions of polyorganosiloxane oils or resins, and combinations of polyorganosiloxane with silica particles wherein the polyorganosiloxane is chemisorbed or fused<br>
onto the silica. Silicone suds suppressors are well known in the art and are, for example, disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,265,779, issued May 5, 1981 to Gandolfo et al and European Patent Application No. 8930785 1.9, published February 7, 1990, by Starch, M. S.<br>

Silicone defoamers and suds controlling agents in granular detergent compositions are disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,933,672, Bartolotta et al, and in U.S. Patent 4,652.392. Baginski et al, issued March 24, 1987.<br>
An exemplary silicone based suds suppressor for use herein is a suds suppressing amount of a suds controlling agent consisting essentially of:<br>

The primary silicone suds suppressor is branched/crosslinked and preferably not linear.<br>
To illustrate this point further, typical liquid laundry detergent compositions with controlled suds will optionally comprise from about 0.001 to about 1, preferably from about 0.01 to about 0.7. most preferably from about 0.05 to about 0.5, weight % of said silicone suds suppressor, which comprises (1) a nonaqueous emulsion of a primary antifoam agent which is a mixture of (a) a polyorganosiloxane, (b) a resinous siloxane or a silicone resin-producing silicone compound, (c) a finely divided filler material, and (d) a catalyst to promote the reaction of mixture components (a), (b) and (c), to form silanolates; (2) at least one nonionic silicone surfactant; and (3) polyethylene glycol or a copolymer of polyethylene-polypropylene glycol having a solubility in water at room temperature of more than about 2 weight %; and without polypropylene glycol. Similar amounts can be used in granular compositions, gels, etc. See also U.S. Patents 4,978,471, Starch, issued December 18, 1990, and 4,983,316, Starch, issued January 8, 1991, 5,288,431, Huber et al., issued February 22, 1994, and U.S. Patents 4,639,489 and 4,749,740, Aizawa et al at column 1, line 46 through column 4, line 35.<br>

less than about 1,000, preferably between about 100 and 800. The polyethylene glycol and polyethylene/polypropylene copolymers herein have a solubility in water at room temperature of more than about 2 weight %, preferably more than about 5 weight %.<br>
The preferred solvent herein is polyethylene glycol having an average molecular weight of less than about 1,000, more preferably between about 100 and 800, most preferably between 200 and 400, and a copolymer of polyethylene glycol/polypropylene glycol, preferably PPG 200/PEG 300 Preferred is a weight ratio of between about 1:1 and 1:10, most preferably between 1:3 and 1:6, of polyethylene glycol:copolymer of polyethylene-polypropylene glycol.<br>

Other suds suppressors useful herein comprise the secondary alcohols (e.g., 2-alkyl alkanols) and mixtures of such alcohols with silicone oils, such as the silicones disclosed in U.S. 4,798,679, 4,075,118 and EP 150,872. The secondary alcohols include the C6-C16 alkyl alcohols having a C]-C]g chain. A preferred alcohol is 2-butyl octanol, which is available from Condea under the trademark ISOFOL 12. Mixtures of secondary alcohols are available under the trademark ISALCHEM 123 from Enichem. Mixed suds suppressors typically comprise mixtures of alcohol -silicone at a weight ratio of 1:5 to 5:1.<br>
For any detergent compositions to be used in automatic laundry washing machines, suds should not form to the extent that they overflow the washing machine   Suds suppressors, when utilized, are preferably present in a "suds suppressing amount. By "suds suppressing amount" is meant that the formulator of the composition can select an amount of this suds controlling agent that will sufficiently control the suds to result in a low-sudsing laundry detergent for use in automatic laundry washing machines.<br>
The compositions herein will generally comprise from 0% to about 5% of suds suppressor. When utilized as suds suppressors, monocarboxylic fatty acids, and salts therein, will be present typically in amounts up to about 5%, by weight, of the detergent composition. Preferably, from about 0.5% to about 3% of fatty monocarboxylate suds suppressor is utilized. Silicone suds suppressors are typically utilized in amounts up to about 2.0%, by weight, of the detergent composition, although higher amounts may be used. This upper limit is practical in nature, due primarily to concern with keeping costs minimized and effectiveness of lower amounts for effectively controlling sudsing. Preferably from about 0.01% to about 1% of silicone suds suppressor is used, more preferably from about 0.25% to about 0.5%. As used herein, these weight percentage values include any silica that may be utilized in combination with polyorganosiloxane, as well as any adjunct materials that may be utilized. Monostearyl phosphate suds suppressors are generally utilized in amounts ranging from about 0.1% to about 2%, by weight, of the composition. Hydrocarbon suds suppressors are typically utilized in amounts ranging from about 0.01% to about<br>
5.0%, although higher levels can be used. The alcohol suds suppressors are typically used at 0.2%-3% by weight of the finished compositions.<br>
Dye Transfer Inhibitors<br>
The composition of the present invention may also include one or more materials effective for inhibiting the transfer of dyes from one fabric to another during the cleaning process. Generally, such dye transfer inhibiting agents include polyvinyl pyrrolidone polymers, polyamine N-oxide polymers, copolymers of N-vinylpyrrolidone and N-vinylimidazole, manganese phthalocyanine, peroxidases, and mixtures thereof. If used, these agents typically comprise from about 0.01% to about 10% by weight of the composition, preferably from about 0.01% to about 5%, and more preferably from about 0.05% to about 2%.<br>
More specifically, the polyamine N-oxide polymers preferred for use herein contain units having the following structural formula: R-AX-P; wherein P is a polymerizable unit to which an N-O group can be attached or the N-O group can form part of the polymerizable unit or the N-O group can be attached to both units; A is one of the following structures: -NC(O)-, -C(O)O-, -S-, -O-, -N=; x is 0 or 1; and R is aliphatic, ethoxylated aliphatics, aromatics, heterocyclic or alicyclic groups or any combination thereof to which the nitrogen of the N-O group can be attached or the N-O group is part of these groups. Preferred polyamine N-oxides are those wherein R is a heterocyclic group such as pyridine, pyrrole, imidazole, pyrrolidine, piperidine and derivatives thereof.<br>
The N-O group can be represented by the following general structures:<br>
(Structure Removed)<br>
wherein Rj, R2, R3 are aliphatic, aromatic, heterocyclic or alicyclic groups or combinations thereof; x, y and z are 0 or 1; and the nitrogen of the N-O group can be attached or form part of any of the aforementioned groups. The amine oxide unit of the polyamine N-oxides has a pKa 
Any polymer backbone can be used as long as the amine oxide polymer formed is water-soluble and has dye transfer inhibiting properties. Examples of suitable polymeric backbones are polyvinyls, polyalkylenes, polyesters, polyethers, polyamide, polyimides, polyacrylates and mixtures thereof. These polymers include random or block copolymers where one monomer type is an amine N-oxide and the other monomer type is an N-oxide. The amine N-oxide polymers typically have a ratio of amine to the amine N-oxide of 10:1 to 1:1,000,000. However, the number of amine oxide groups present in the polyamine oxide polymer can be varied by appropriate copolymerization or by an appropriate degree of N-oxidation. The polyamine oxides can be obtained in almost any degree of polymerization. Typically, the average molecular weight is within the range of 500 to 1.000,000:<br>
more preferred 1,000 to 500,000; most preferred 5,000 to 100,000. This preferred class of materials can be referred to as "PVNO".<br>
The most preferred polyamine N-oxide useful in the detergent: compositions herein is poly(4-vinylpyridine-N-oxide) which has an average molecular weight of about 50,000 and an amine to amine N-oxide ratio of about 1 :4.<br>
Copolymers of N-vinylpyrrolidone and N-vinylimidazole polymers (referred to as a class as "PVPVI") are also preferred for use herein. Preferably the PVPVI has an average molecular weight range from 5,000 to 1,000,000, more preferably from 5,000 to 200,000, and most preferably from 10,000 to 20,000. (The average molecular weight range is determined by light scattering as described in Barth, et at., Chemical Analysis. Vol 1 13. "Modern Methods of Polymer Characterization", the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.) The PVPVI copolymers typically have a molar ratio of N-vinylimidazole to N-vinylpyrrolidone from 1:1 to 0.2: 1, more preferably from 0.8:1 to 0.3:1, most preferably from 0.6:1 to 0.4: 1 . These copolymers can be either linear or branched.<br>
The present invention compositions also may employ a polyvinylpyrrolidone ("PVP") having an average molecular weight of from about 5,000 to about 400,000, preferably from about 5,000 to about 200,000, and more preferably from about 5,000 to about 50,000. PVP's are known to persons skilled in the detergent field; see, for example, EP-A-262,897 and EP-A-256,696, incorporated herein by reference. Compositions containing PVP can also contain polyethylene glycol ("PEG") having an average molecular weight from about 500 to about 100,000, preferably from about 1,000 to about 10,000. Preferably, the ratio of PEG to PVP on a ppm basis delivered in wash solutions is from about 2: 1 to about 50: 1 , and more preferably from about 3: 1 to about 1 0: 1 .<br>
The detergent compositions herein may also optionally contain from about 0.005% to 5% by weight of certain types of hydrophilic optical brighteners which also provide a dye transfer inhibition action. If used, the compositions herein will preferably comprise from about 0.01% to 1% by weight of such optical brighteners.<br>
The hydrophilic optical brighteners useful in the present invention are those having the structural formula:<br>
(Formula  Removed)<br><br>
wherein Rj is selected from anilino, N-2-bis-hydroxyethyl and NH-2-hydroxyethyl; R2 is selected from N-2-bis-hydroxyethyl, N-2-hydroxyethyl-N-methylamino, morphilino, chloro and amino; and M is a salt-forming cation such as sodium or potassium.<br>
When in the above formula, Rj is anilino, R2 is N-2-bis-hydroxyethyl and M is a cation such as sodium, the brightener is 4,4',-bis[(4-anilino-6-(N-2-bis-hydroxyethyl)-s-triazine-2-<br><br>
yl)amino]-2,2'-stilbenedisulfonic acid and disodium salt. This particular brightener species is commercially marketed under the trade name Tinopal-LTNPA-GX by Ciba-Gelgy Corporation. Tinopal-UNPA-GX is the preferred hydrophilic optical brightener useful in the detergent compositions herein.<br>
When in the above formula, Rj is anilino, R2 is N-2-hydroxyethyl-N-2-methylamino and M is a cation such as sodium, the brightener is 4,4'-bis[(4-anilino-6-(N-2-hydroxyethyl-N-methylamino)-s-triazine-2-yl)amino]2,2'-stilbenedisulfonic acid disodium salt. This particular brightener species is commercially marketed under the trade name Tinopal 5BM-GX by Ciba-Geigy Corporation.<br>
When in the above formula, Rj is anilino, R2 is morphilino and M is a cation such as sodium, the brightener is 4,4'-bis[(4-anilino-6-morphilino-s-triazine-2-yl)amino]2,2'-stilbenedisulfonic acid, sodium salt. This particular brightener species is commercially marketed under the trade name Tinopal AMS-GX by Ciba Geigy Corporation.<br>
The specific optical brightener species selected for use in the present invention provide especially effective dye transfer inhibition performance benefits when used in combination with the selected polymeric dye transfer inhibiting agents hereinbefore described. The combination of such selected polymeric materials (e.g., PVNO and/or PVPVI) with such selected optical brighteners (e.g., Tinopal LTNPA-GX, Tinopal 5BM-GX and/or Tinopal AMS-GX) provides significantly better dye transfer inhibition in aqueous wash solutions than does either of these two detergent composition components when used alone.  Without being bound by theory, it is believed that such brighteners work this way because they have high affinity for fabrics in the wash solution and therefore deposit relatively quick on these fabrics. The extent to which brighteners deposit on fabrics in the wash solution can be defined by a parameter called the "exhaustion coefficient". The exhaustion coefficient is in general as the ratio of a) the brightener material deposited on fabric to b) the initial brightener concentration in the wash liquor. Brighteners with relatively high exhaustion coefficients are the most suitable for inhibiting dye transfer in the context of the present invention.<br>
Of course, it will be appreciated that other, conventional optical brightener types of compounds can optionally be used in the present compositions to provide conventional fabric "brightness" benefits, rather than a true dye transfer inhibiting effect. Such usage is conventional and well-known to detergent formulations.<br>
Other Adjunct Ingredients<br>
The detergent composition may also include enzyme stabilizers, brighteners, polymeric dispersing agents (i.e. polyacrylates), carriers, hydrotropes, processing aids, dyes or pigments, and perfumes.<br>
High Density Detergent Composition Processes<br>
Various means and equipment are available to prepare high density (i.e., greater than about 650, grams/liter or "g/1"), high solubility, free-flowing, detergent compositions according to the present invention. Current commercial practice in the field employs spray-drying towers to manufacture spray dried granules which often have a density less than about 500 g/1. In this procedure, an aqueous slurry of various heat-stable ingredients in the final detergent composition are formed into homogeneous granules by passage through a spray-drying tower, using conventional techniques, at temperatures of about 175°C to about 225°C.<br>
The agglomerates discussed herein can be formed by feeding, in either a continuous or batch mode, starting detergent ingredients directly into mixing/densifying equipment that is commercially available. One particularly preferred embodiment involves charging a surfactant paste and an anhydrous builder material into a high speed mixer/densifier followed by a moderate speed mixer/densifier to form high density detergent agglomerates. See Capeci et al, U.S. Patent 5,366,652, issued November 22, 1994. Optionally, the liquid/solids ratio of the starting detergent ingredients in such a process can be selected to obtain high density agglomerates that are more free flowing and crisp.<br>
A suitable high speed mixer/densifier for this process is a device marketed under the trade name "Lodige CB 30" or "Lodige CB 30 Recycler" which comprises a static cylindrical mixing drum having a central rotating shaft with mixing/cutting blades mounted thereon.  In use, the ingredients for the detergent composition are introduced into the drum and the shaft/blade assembly is rotated at speeds in the range of 100-2500 rpm to provide thorough mixing/densification. See Jacobs et al, U.S. Patent 5,149,455, issued September 22, 1992. The preferred residence time in the high speed mixer/derisifier is from about 5 to 60 seconds. Other such apparatus includes the devices marketed under the trade name "Shugi Granulator" and under the trade name "Drais K-TTP 80). Equipment such as that marketed under the trade name "Lodige KM" (Series 300 or 600) or "Lodige Ploughshare" mixer/densifiers are suitable for this process step. Such equipment is typically operated at 40-160 rpm. The residence time of the detergent ingredients in the moderate speed mixer/densifier is from about 1 to 12 minutes. Other useful equipment includes the device which is available under the trade name "Drais K-T 160". This process step which employs a moderate speed mixer/densifier (e.g. Lodige KM) can be used by itself or sequentially with the aforementioned high speed mixer/densifier (e.g. Lodige CB) to achieve the desired density. Other types of granules manufacturing apparatus useful herein include the apparatus disclosed in U.S. Patent 2,306,898, to G. L. Heller, December 29, 1942.<br>
While it may be more suitable to use the high speed mixer/densifier followed by the low speed mixer/densifier, the reverse sequential mixer/densifier configuration is also contemplated by the invention. One or a combination of various parameters including residence times in the mixer/densifiers. operating temperatures of the equipment, temperature and/or composition of the<br>
granules, the use of adjunct ingredients such as liquid binders and flow aids, can be used to optimize the agglomeration process. For example, the agglomerates can be coated with a liquid binder and aluminosilicate.<br>
Optionally, the process may include one or more recycle streams of undersized particles produced by the process which are fed back to the mixer/densifiers for further agglomeration or build-up. The oversized particles produced by this process can be sent to grinding apparatus and then fed back to the mixing/densifying equipment. These additional recycle process steps facilitate build-up agglomeration of the starting detergent ingredients resulting in a finished composition having a uniform distribution of the desired particle size (400-700 microns) and density (&gt; 550 g/1) Other suitable processes which do not call for the use of spray-drying towers are described by Bollier et al, U.S. Patent 4,828,721, issued May 9, 1989; Beerse et al, U.S. Patent 5,108,646, issued April 28, 1992; and, Jolicoeur, U.S. Patent 5,178,798, issued January 12, 1993.<br>
Another suitable agglomeration process which can be used herein involves feeding a liquid acid precursor of an anionic surfactant, an alkaline inorganic material (e.g. sodium carbonate) and optionally other detergent ingredients into a high speed mixer/densifier (residence time 5-30 seconds) so as to form agglomerates containing a partially or totally neutralized anionic surfactant salt and the other starting detergent ingredients. Optionally, the contents in the high speed mixer/densifier can be sent to a moderate speed mixer/densifier (e.g. Lodige K.M) for further agglomeration resulting in the finished high density detergent composition. See Appel et al, U.S. Patent 5,164,108, issued November 17, 1992.<br>
In order to make the present invention more readily understood, reference is made to the following examples, which are intended to be illustrative only and not intended to be limiting in scope<br>
EXAMPLES I - III<br>
These Examples illustrate several compositions in accordance with the invention. Table I presents the composition of the agglomerates in the composition which are made by a two step buildup agglomeration process in which starting detergent ingredients are fed to a high speed mixer/densifier (Lodige CB 30) followed by a moderate speed mixer/densifer (Lodige KM 600). The agglomerates are dried to produce the finished agglomerates which are then admixed with the spray dried granules and other admixed detergent ingredients. Additional liquid adjunct detergent ingredients are thereafter sprayed on to form the finished composition.<br><br>
TABLE 1(Table Removed)<br><br>
Table II illustrates the full formulations of the detergent compositions according to the invention.<br>
Table II(Table Removed)<br><br>
' Sodium terephthalate sulfoisophthalate polymer which is an oligorner comprising about one sulfoisophthaloyl unit, 5 terephthaloyl units, oxyethyleneoxy and oxy-l,2-prppyleneoxy units in a ratio of from about 1.7 to about 1.8, and two end-cap units of sodium 2-(2-hydroxyethoxy)-ethanesulfonate.<br>
2	Polydimethylsiloxane with trimethylsilyl end blocking units available from Dow Corning, Inc.<br>
3	Alkyl ethoxylate commercially available from Shell Chemical Co. under the trademark NEODOL<br>
(23-9).<br>
The compositions exemplified above unexpectedly exhibit improved flow properties as evidenced, in part, by the ease with which the consumer can "scoop" the composition from the box after storage. This result is primarily attributed to the reduced "caking" tendency of the detergent compositions herein. One well-known technique for measuring the "caking" of the composition is to place a weight on the top of the composition as it is contained in the detergent box and store the product for a period of time. Thereafter, the weight is removed and graders judge the ability to scoop the composition. As stated, the compositions within the scope of the invention have reduced "caking" and are therefore easier to scoop from the detergent box.<br>
Having thus described the invention in detail, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that various changes may be made without departing from the scope of the invention and the invention is not to be considered limited to what is described in the specification.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
