				<td>Process for the regioselective preparation of l-alkvl-3-haloalkvlpvrazole-4-carboxvlic acid derivatives<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the regioselective synthesis of 1 -alky 1-3 -halo-alkylpyrazole-4-carboxylic acid derivatives by cyclization of 2,3-disubstituted acrylic acid derivatives with hydrazines in the presence of carbonyl compounds.<br>
2-Dihaloacyl-3-dialkylaminoacrylic esters of the formula II (Y=COOAlk, Z=O) are useful intermediates for the preparation of dihalomethyl-substituted pyrazolylcarboxylic acid derivatives which can be used as precursors of fungicidally active compounds (cf. WO 03/070705).<br>
Pyrazolecarboxylic acid derivatives are usually prepared by reacting acrylic acid derivatives having two leaving groups (Z and A) with hydrazines.<br>
The reaction with the monoalkylhydrazines gives mainly 1-alkylpyrazoles. However, the cyclization is frequently not regioselective. As a consequence, depending on the substrate and the reaction conditions, the unwanted 5-alkylpyrazoles are formed in amounts between 10 and 80% (see Scheme 1).<br>
Scheme Removed<br>
Scheme 1<br>
The synthesis of 1-alkylpyrazolecarboxylic acid derivatives by alkylation of pyrazole derivatives unsubstituted in the 1-position frequently also proceeds with formation of both regioisomers (see Scheme 2).<br>
Scheme Removed<br><br>
Scheme 2<br>
An alternative route of preparing fluorohaloalkylpyrazolecarboxylic acids is the cyclization of, for example, 4,4-dichloro-2-[(dimethylamino)methylidene]-3-oxobutanoate with alkyl-hydrazines followed by a halogen exchange.<br>
WO 2005/042468 discloses a process for preparing 2-dihaloacyl-3-aminoacrylic esters by reacting acid halides with dialkylaminoacrylic esters, followed by their cyclization with alkylhydrazines.<br>
The European patent application No. 07117232.4, hitherto unpublished, describes a process for preparing HCl-free 2-dihaloacyl-3-aminoacrylic esters by reacting acid fluorides with dialkyl¬aminoacrylic acid derivatives. The process can be carried out in the absence of a base, as a result of which the removal of halide salts is not required.<br>
WO 2008/022777 describes a process for preparing 3-dihalomethylpyrazole-4-carboxylic acid derivatives by reacting a,a-fluoroamines in the presence of Lewis acids with acrylic acid derivatives, followed by their reaction with alkylhydrazines.<br>
WO 2006/090778 discloses a process for preparing l-methyl-3-difluoromethylpyrazole-carboxylic esters by cyclization of 2-alkoxymethylenefluoroacylacetate with methylhydrazine in the presence of water and a base. The reaction was carried out in the presence of NaOH or KOH although under these strongly alkaline conditions there is also partial hydrolysis of the COOEt group of the pyrazole ring.<br>
However, the processes above-described all have the disadvantage that the cyclization, even at low temperatures, proceeds only with unsatisfactory regioselectivity.<br>
In view of the prior art described above, it is an object of the present invention to provide a process which does not have the disadvantages mentioned above, thus providing regioselective access to 1 -alky 1-3 -haloalkylpyrazole-4-carboxylic acid derivatives.<br>
The object described above was achieved by a process for preparing 1-alky 1-3-haloalkyl-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid derivatives of the formula (I)<br>

R2        is selected from the group consisting of trifluoromethyl and difluoromethyl,<br>
Y	is selected from the group consisting of (C=O)OR3, where R3 is methyl or ethyl.<br>
The process according to the invention is preferably carried out in a temperature range of from -20°C to +150°C, particularly preferably at temperatures of from -10°C to +70°C<br>
The process according to the invention is generally carried out under atmospheric pressure. However, alternatively, it is also possible to operate under reduced pressure to remove the highly volatile dialkylamines.<br>
The reaction time is not critical and may, depending on the batch size and the temperature, be chosen from a range of between a few minutes and a number of hours.<br>
When carrying out the process according to the invention, 1 mol of the acrylic acid derivative of the formula (II) is reacted with from 0.5 mol to 3 mol, preferably from 0.5 mol to 1.5 mol, particularly preferably with an equimolar amount, of the hydrazine of the formula (ID) and with from 0.5 mol to 50 mol, preferably from 0.5 mol to 20 mol, particularly preferably with from 1 to 2 mol of the compound of the formula (IV).<br>
Preferably, the hydrazine of the formula (III), dissolved in the solvent, is initially charged together with compound of the formula (TV), and the acrylic acid derivative of the formula (II) is added. However, it is also possible to reverse the order. Ideally, the reaction is carried out directly in an excess of the compound of the formula (TV), for example in acetone or pinacolone. Prior to the isolation of the product, the acid is added to the reaction mixture. Suitable acids are selected from the group consisting of HC1, H2SO4, CF3COOH, CF3SO3H, CH3COOH; particular preference is given to HC1 and H2SO4.<br>
In the context of the present invention, preference is given to using 2-acylated acrylic acid derivatives of the formula (II) selected from the group consisting of ethyl (2-ethoxymethylene)-4,4-difluoromethylacetoacetate, ethyl-(2-ethoxymethylene)-4,4,4-trifluoromethylacetoacetate, ethyl-(2-ethoxymethylene)-4,4,4-trifluoromethylacetonitrile.<br>
In the context of the present invention, the monoalkylhydrazines of the formula (III) are preferably selected from the group consisting of monomethylhydrazine, monoethylhydrazine, monopropylhydrazine and phenylhydrazine.<br>
In the context of the present invention, the compounds of the formula (IV) are preferably carbonyl compounds; particularly preferably, they are selected from the group consisting of acetone, pinacolone, benzaldehyde, benzophenone, cyclohexanone, methyl ethyl ketone; very particular preference is given to acetone, pinacolone and benzaldehyde.<br>
A further advantage of the process according to the invention is the fact that, to prepare the pyrazoles of the formula 1, it is possible to use aqueous methylhydrazine solutions and the explosive concentrated methylhydrazine, which is also used as rocket fuel, is not necessarily required.<br>
The reaction can be carried out in the absence of a solvent or in a solvent. The reaction is preferably carried out in a solvent. Suitable solvents are, for example, selected from the group consisting of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, such as, for example, water, alcohols (methanol, ethanol, isopropanol), n-hexane, benzene or toluene, which may be substituted by fluorine and chlorine atoms, such as methylene chloride, dichloroethane, fluorobenzene, chlorobenzene or dichlorobenzene; ethers, such as, for example, diethyl ether, diphenyl ether, methyl tert-butyl ether, isopropyl ethyl ether, dioxane, diglym, dimethylglycol, dimethoxyethane (DME) or THF; nitriles, such as methylnitrile, butylnitrile or phenylnitrile; amides, such as dimethylformamide (DMF) or N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), or mixtures of such solvents, with acetonitrile, dichloromethane, THF, DME and ethyl acetate, acetone, water, ethanol being particularly preferred.<br>
After the reaction has ended, for example, the solvents are removed and the product is isolated by filtration or initially extracted with water, the organic phase is separated off and the solvent is removed by distillation.<br>
The process according to the invention is illustrated in more detail by the examples below. However, the examples are not to be interpreted as limiting.<br>
Preparation Examples<br>
Example 1: Ethyl 3-(difluoromethyl)-l-methyI-lH-pyrazole-4-carboxyIate<br>
