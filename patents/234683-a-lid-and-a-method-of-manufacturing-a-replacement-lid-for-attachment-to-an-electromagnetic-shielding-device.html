BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention pertains to a replacement cover for an electromagnetic shielding system wherein solder is applied to the cover during manufacturing, and wherein the replacement cover is placed on the shield and fused to the shield by the user applying a heat source.<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
An example of prior art for replacing the lid of an electromagnetic shielding device is found in U.S. Patent No. 6,501,016, entitled "Electromagnetic Shielding System for Printed Circuit Board" issued on December 31, 2002 to Sosnowski. This reference discloses the repair of an electromagnetic shielding system wherein the replacement cover is a metal foil with an adhesive surface. Alternatively, a mechanical locking system can be used.<br>
While this reference discloses a method and apparatus which have been satisfactory in many respects, further improvements are sought, particularly with providing a more secure bond between the shielding device and the replacement cover. Moreover, the use of a mechanical locking system was, on occasion, not practical when there was limited clearance around the shielding device.<br>
Additionally, prior attempts at using solder have not proved to be practical. Using conventional manual soldering techniques on-site was not practical as the amount of solder was not controlled or repeatable and could lead to components shorting from overflowed<br><br>
solder or electrical leaks or mechanical deficiencies due to too little solder. Moreover, such conventional manual techniques were very time consuming.<br>
OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a replacement lid for an electromagnetic shielding device wherein the coimection between the replacement lid and the shielding device is secure.<br>
It is therefore a further object of the present invention to provide a replacement lid for an electromagnetic shielding device which does not require any substantially increased clearance over the shielding device.<br>
It is therefore a still further object of the present invention to provide a replacement lid for an electromagnetic shielding device wherein the risk of shorting or otiherwise damaging the shielded components is substantially eliminated.<br>
It is therefore a still further object of the present invention to provide a replacement lid for an electromagnetic shielding device wherein the replacement lid can be installed quickly and reliably, without a high level of skill being iavolved on the part of the user.<br>
These and other objects are attained by providing a replacement lid for an electromagnetic shielding device. The replacement lid is generally planar, possibly with embossed raised surfaces, with stenciled solder segments formed immediately inwardly adjacent from the periphery thereof The replacement lid is installed onto an electromagnetic shielding device by placing the stenciled solder segments against the walls of the electromagnetic shielding device so that the unstenciled side of the replacement lid is exposed. The installer then applies a heat source to the unstenciled side of the replacement lid thereby melting the solder and forming a bond between the replacement lid and the shielding device. The replacement lid may be manufactured by securing the replacement lid<br><br>
between a platen and a stencil and using a squeegee to apply solder through the stencil onto the replacement lid.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Further objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description and claims and from the accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>
Figure 1 is a perspective view of the shielding can, prior to removal of the scored section.<br>
Figure 2 is a perspective view of the shielding can, after removal of the scored section.<br>

Figure 11 is a perspective view of the solder pre-form of the present invention.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Referring now to the drawings in detail, wherein like numerals refer to like elements throughout the several views, one sees that Figures 1 and 2 are perspective view of the shielding can 100, before and after, respectively, removal of the scored lid section 102.<br>
Figures 3 and 4 are perspective views of the replacement lid 10 of the present invention, before and after, respectively, the application of the stenciled solder segments 12. Replacement hd 10 is generally planar and typically square or rectangular, or whatever shape is required for the specific installation. Moreover, replacement lid 10 is typically made from conductive sheet metal to maintain the electromagnetic shielding and thermal conductivity and further to result in low costs, both for materials and manufacturing. Inwardly adjacent from the periphery of replacement lid 10 are stenciled solder segments 12. Stenciled solder segments 12 are sized and configured to match the outline of the shielding device 100 (see Figures 1, 2, 8 and 9) to which the replacement lid 10 is to be attached. There are gaps formed between the solder segments 12, both to provide a space for any excess solder to flow during installation and fiirther to provide for a structurally sound stencil 200 (see Figs. 4-6).<br>
Alternatively, a solder pre-form 20 can be used, as shown in Figures 10 and 11, in place of the solder segments 12. The solder pre-form 20 is typically manufactured by die-cutting a foil-like sheet of solder paste or similar material into the desired shape.<br>
To install replacement hd 10 to shielding device 100, the installer aligns and places the stenciled solder segments 12 against the walls of the open shielding device 100 so that the solder is against the shielding device and the reverse unstenciled side of the replacement hd 10 is facing outwardly. The user then applies a heat source, such as a soldering iron or heat gun, to the reverse unstenciled side of the replacement lid 10 so that the solder segments 12 melt and secure the replacement lid 10 to the shielding device 100.<br><br>
In order to apply the stenciled solder segments 12 to the replacement lid 10 during the initial manufacturing process, as shown in Figures 5-7, the replacement lid 10 (at this stage, a piece of sheet metal without the stenciled solder segments applied) is placed onto a platen 300 which has a central recess 302 for capturing the replacement lid 10 and cylindrical guides 304, 306 for aligning with similar apertures 202, 204 of stencil 200 thereby securing replacement lid 100 between platen 300 and stencil 200. Stencil 200 has stencil pattern 206 thereon so that a squeegee (not shown) can be used to apply a controlled amount of solder paste through stencil pattern 206 thereby forming stenciled solder segments 12.<br>
Thus the several aforementioned objects and advantages are most effectively attained.
