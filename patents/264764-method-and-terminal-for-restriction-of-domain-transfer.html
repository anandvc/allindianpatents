METHOD AND TERMINAL FOR RESTRICTION OF DOMAIN<br>

Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Solution<br>
The present application claims the priority benefits of U.S. Provisional Application<br>
No. 60/765,211 filed on February 6, 2006 and Korean Patent Application Nos.<br>
10-2006-0114136 and 10-2006-0137127 respectively filed on November 17, 2006 and<br>
December 28, 2006 in Republic of Korea. The entire contents of these applications are<br>
herein fully incorporated by reference.<br>
The present invention relates to a Voice Call Continuity (VCC), and more par-<br>
ticularly, to restricting a domain transfer in a VCC.<br>
In general, a Voice Call Continuity (VCC) refers to a type of application, namely, a<br>
home IMS (IP Multimedia System) application which is capable of transporting voice<br>
calls between a CS (Circuit Switching) domain and an IMS domain. The VCC<br>
provides functions of voice call originations, voice call terminations, a domain<br>
selection and a domain transfer from the CS domain to the IMS domain or vice versa.<br>
Here, the domain transfer refers to transferring access legs for voice calls toward a user<br>
equipment (UE) (i.e., a terminal) from the CS domain to the IMS domain or vice versa<br>
during an active session. The access leg denotes a call control leg between a VCC UE<br>
and a Domain Transfer Function (DTF) of an VCC application (server).<br>
Through the domain transfer procedures, continuity for one or more voice calls/<br>
sessions is provided between the IMS domain and the CS domain while the VCC UE<br>
performs the one or more voice calls/sessions.<br>
Generally, a domain transfer for a certain voice call/session from the CS domain to<br>
the IMS domain or vice versa is initiated only when a DTF is positioned on a signal<br>
path of the voice call/session setup. For this, positioning of the DTF on the way of the<br>
signal path of the voice call/session setup is referred to as anchoring in IMS or<br>
anchoring.<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates a general architecture of a network for providing a VCC service.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 1, a VCC UE 10 denotes all types of terminals which support<br>
the VCC service. The VCC UE can access CS and PS (packet switching) domains.<br>
That is, when accessing the CS domain, the VCC UE uses a UE-CS (not shown)<br>
provided therein, whereas the VCC UE uses a UE-IMS (not shown) provided therein<br>
when accessing the PS domain.<br>
A VCC application 30 is an application server for providing the VCC service, and is<br><br>
constituted with entities which perform a series of functions. The series of functions<br>
may include functions required to setup voice calls toward the VCC UE, and functions<br>
required to switch an access leg of the VCC UE between the CS domain and the IMS<br>
domain with maintaining an active session. For instance, the series of functions can be<br>
a Domain Transfer Function 30a, a Domain Selection Function 30d, a CS Adaptation<br>
Function 30b, and a CAMEL Service Application 30c. Detailed capabilities and<br>
operations for these series of functions are described in 3GPP TS 23.206 V1.2.0.<br>
Generally, the CS domain entities include a Visited Mobile Switching Center<br>
(VMSC), a Gateway MSC (GMSC), a gsmSCF, and the like. The IMS domain entities<br>
include a P-CSCF, a S-CSCF, a I-CSCF and a Media Gateway Control Function<br>
(MGCF).<br>
Fig. 2 is a signal flowchart among each component of a network (e.g., the network<br>
shown in Fig. 1) in a case where a domain transfer occurs between the IMS domain<br>
and CS domain. Hereinafter, domain transfer procedures in a VCC service according to<br>
a background art will be explained with reference to Fig. 2.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, it is just a VCC UE which initiates a domain transfer in a VCC.<br>
That is, the VCC UE establishes a voice call (or session) over the CS domain or IMS<br>
domain with a network and then may decide whether or not to initiate a domain<br>
transfers by moving (or transferring) from one domain to another domain. By doing<br>
this, the established voice call (so-called "ongoing call") may continue on the way of<br>
handing over (i.e., domain transfer) from the CS domain to the IMS domain or vice<br>
verse. Here, for initiating (performing) a domain transfer for the voice call from one<br>
domain (e.g., IMS domain) to another domain (e.g., CS domain), the VCC UE may<br>
initiate the domain transfer based on previously-stored information. Here, the in-<br>
formation previously stored in the VCC UE may include radio conditions of a CS<br>
network to access, operator policy, user preferences, and the like.<br>
Procedures (1) - (4) of initiating, by the VCC UE, a domain transfer from a CS<br>
domain to an IMS domain according to the background art are as follows:<br>
(1)	The VCC UE may decide to initiate a domain transfer for a voice call which has<br>
originated and is ongoing toward the CS domain, namely, an outgoing call.<br>
(2)	When the VCC UE sends an INVITE message to a VCC application, a Domain<br>
Transfer Function (DTF) in the VCC application establishes an IMS session leg for the<br>
voice call over the IMS domain.<br>
(3)	After the IMS session leg is established between the DTF and the IMS domain,<br>
the DTF routs the ongoing session to the IMS domain.<br>
(4)	After routing the ongoing session to the IMS domain, a CS session leg is<br>
released.<br>
Thus, the domain transfer for the voice call is initiated from the CS domain to the<br><br>
IMS domain through the procedures of (1) ~ (4).<br>
As aforementioned with respect to the domain transfer in the VCC, the domain<br>
transfer in the VCC is initiated by the VCC UE. However, it is the network that sub-<br>
stantially handles the domain transfer initiated by the VCC UE. Also, the network may<br>
not perform the domain transfer requested by the VCC UE, but can restrict the domain<br>
transfer according to a specific state. For instance, a domain transfer at the network<br>
side may be generically or temporarily restricted based upon operator policy. The re-<br>
striction of the domain transfer may include various operations made by the network,<br>
for example, an operation to ignore the request of the domain transfer initiated by the<br>
VCC UE, another operation to delay the domain transfer requested by the VCC UE,<br>
and the like.<br>
However, the network of the VCC (e.g., VCC application) according to the<br>
background art does not have any function of informing the VCC UE of operator<br>
policy which is temporarily or generically changed. Although the operator policy (or a<br>
change therein) may cause the network to be in a state in which it restricts the domain<br>
transfer (and thus may not be able to perform the domain transfer), the VCC UE does<br>
not and can not recognize this state of the network in which the domain transfer is<br>
restricted because the network does not inform the UE of this restriction in the<br>
background art. Accordingly, since the VCC UE can not know that the domain transfer<br>
is restricted in the network, the VCC UE still attempts or initiates the domain transfer<br>
for ongoing calls. This results in the limitations and problems of wasting signaling,<br>
radio resources, battery life of the UE, CPU power of the VCC UE, and the like.<br>
Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a technique of sending<br>
by a network (e.g., VCC application) information related to a restriction of a domain<br>
transfer to a VCC UE, e.g., when a change in operator policy of the network causes a<br>
restriction of the domain transfer.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a UE (i.e., terminal) which<br>
analyzes information related to a restriction of a domain transfer sent from a network,<br>
and decides whether or not to initiate a domain transfer for a call which is currently<br>
ongoing by taking into account the analyzed domain transfer information.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a terminal, server, system and<br>
method for controlling VCC operations by communicating domain transfer restriction<br>
information, which address the limitations and disadvantages associated with the<br>
background art.<br>
To achieve these and other objects, there is provided according to an aspect of the<br>
present invention a method for restricting a domain transfer comprising: receiving, by<br>
a terminal, domain transfer restriction information from a network server; analyzing<br>
the domain transfer restriction information by the terminal; and deciding, by the<br><br>
terminal, whether to initiate a domain transfer for a call by taking into account the<br>
analyzed domain transfer restriction information.<br>
To achieve these and other objects, there is provided according to another aspect of<br>
the present invention a terminal comprising: a receiver for receiving domain transfer<br>
restriction information; a transmitter for transmitting a response (Ack) message with<br>
respect to the received domain transfer restriction information; and a VCC enabler for<br>
analyzing the domain transfer restriction information and deciding a domain transfer<br>
for a call by taking into account the analyzed domain transfer restriction information.<br>
To achieve these and other objects, there is provided according to another aspect of<br>
the present invention a network server comprising: a message generator for generating<br>
a domain transfer restriction message including domain transfer restriction information<br>
so as to provide the terminal with the domain transfer restriction information; a<br>
transmitter for transmitting the generated domain transfer restriction message to the<br>
terminal; and a receiver for receiving a response message from the terminal with<br>
respect to the domain transfer restriction message.<br>
According to another aspect, the present invention provides a method for<br>
controlling a voice call continuity (VCC) operation, comprising: receiving, by a<br>
terminal, a message from a network server, the message including domain transfer re-<br>
striction information; checking, by the terminal, the domain transfer restriction in-<br>
formation included in the received message; determining, by the terminal, whether or<br>
not to initiate a domain transfer based on at least the domain transfer restriction in-.<br>
formation; and selectively initiating, by the terminal, the domain transfer based on the<br>
determination result.<br>
According to another aspect, the present invention provides a terminal for<br>
controlling a voice call continuity (VCC) operation, comprising: a receiver to receive a<br>
message from a network server, the message including domain transfer restriction in-<br>
formation; and a controller to check the domain transfer restriction information<br>
included in the received message, to determine whether or not to initiate a domain<br>
transfer based on at least the domain transfer restriction information, and to selectively<br>
initiate the domain transfer based on the determination result.<br>
These and other objects of the present application will become more readily<br>
apparent from the detailed description given hereinafter. However, it should be<br>
understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating<br>
preferred embodiments of the invention, are given by way of illustration only, since<br>
various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will<br>
become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed description.<br>
The present invention will become more fully understood from the detailed de-<br>

Fig. 4 is a block diagram of a terminal or UE according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention.<br>
The present invention is applied to a VCC field of 3GPP, but may be applied to<br>
other communication fields.<br>
Substantially in the present invention, first, when a domain transfer is restricted in a<br>
network (e.g., VCC application), e.g., due to a change in operator policy, a network<br>
notifies a UE (i.e., terminal) of information related to the domain transfer restriction.<br>
Second, the UE stores the information related to the domain transfer restriction, and,<br>
third, the UE analyzes or takes into account the information related to the domain<br>
transfer restriction when attempting the domain transfer for ongoing calls (i.e.,<br>
outgoing calls), thus to decide whether to initiate the domain transfer for the ongoing<br>
calls (i.e., outgoing calls).<br>
Hereinafter, terms preferably used in the present invention will be defined.<br>
A UE according to the present invention may include all types of terminals which<br>
can be used for the VCC service. For instance, the UE according to the present<br>
invention comprehensively includes mobile communications terminals (e.g., UEs,<br>
mobile phones, cellular phones, DMB phones, DVB-H phones, PDAs, PTT, etc.),<br>
digital TV sets, GPS navigation devices, portable game machines, MP3, other home<br>
appliances, and the like.<br>
User preferences denotes information or parameter for defining domain selection<br>
information which indicates what domain the UE user prefers to use for incoming or<br>
outgoing calls when the UE (or terminal) is available over both the CS domain and<br>
IMS domain.<br>
Operator policy denotes information related to a network state or a network<br>
management. The operator policy may frequently be updated according to the network<br>
state or for the network management. The updated operator policy may include in-<br>
formation for restricting a domain transfer for ongoing calls.<br>
An ongoing call denotes a call in progress between a UE and a VCC application,<br>
which includes all of the incoming or outgoing calls.<br><br>
A 'V3 interface' used in the present invention preferably denotes an interface for a<br>
mutual information transfer between a UE and a VCC application. For instance, the V3<br>
interface is shown as 20 in Fig. 1 as an example. The V3 interface may be include a Ut<br>
interface, and an OMA DM (device management). That is, an information transfer<br>
from the UE to the VCC application can be achieved by use of the Ut interface,<br>
whereas an information transfer from the VCC application to the UE can be achieved<br>
by use of the DM using a DM method. As another example, the V3 interface method<br>
may include an unstructured supplementary service data (USSD) method. The Ut<br>
interface, the DM method and the USSD method are known in the art. A protocol of<br>
the V3 interface may exemplarily be a HTTP, which has a XML format.<br>
Hereinafter, constructions and operations of the preferred embodiments of the<br>
present invention will be explained in detail with reference to the accompanying<br>
drawing.<br>
Fig. 3 is a signal flowchart illustrating a method of transmitting domain transfer re-<br>
striction information to restrict a domain transfer between a UE 100 and a VCC ap-<br>
plication 200 in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. This method<br>
can be implemented in the network architecture of Fig. 1 or in other suitable ar-<br>
chitecture. For instance, the UE 100 and the VCC application 200 of Fig. 3 can be re-<br>
spectively the UE 10 and the VCC application 30 of Fig. 1.<br>
Referring to Fig. 3, a call is established between the UE 100 and the VCC ap-<br>
plication 300, in a CS domain or in an IMS domain therebetween, and the call is<br>
ongoing (S1). This call can be an outgoing call originated by the UE 100 or an<br>
incoming call directed to the UE 100 by the network. For the ongoing call between the<br>
UE 100 and the VCC application 300, when any change in operator policy related to a<br>
domain transfer or a change in subscriber information occurs due to a problem caused<br>
by the change in the network state or the network management, or there is any other<br>
reason or cause for the network to restrict the domain transfer for the ongoing call, the<br>
VCC application 300 sends information related to a restriction of the domain transfer<br>
(also referred to as 'domain transfer restriction information' hereafter) to the UE 100<br>
(S2).<br>
According to one example, in step S2 the domain transfer restriction information<br>
can be included in operator policy sent from the VCC application 300 to the UE 100,<br>
e.g., via a V3 interface (e.g., 20 in Fig. 1). That is, the operator policy, sent from the<br>
VCC application 300 to the UE 100, can include the domain transfer restriction in-<br>
formation and other information such as domain selection information indicating a<br>
domain to be selected, domain transfer request information requesting a domain<br>
transfer, etc. According to another example, in step S2 the domain transfer restriction<br>
information can alone be sent from the VCC application 300 to the UE 100, e.g., via<br><br>
the V3 interface. Then the UE 100 can store the received domain transfer restriction in-<br>
formation as part of operator policy stored in the UE 100. According to these<br>
examples, in step S2, it can be said a message/signal is sent from the VCC application<br>
300 to the UE 100, where this message can be (a) a message carrying operator policy<br>
including the domain transfer restriction information, or (b) a message only carrying<br>
the domain transfer restriction information (without operator policy).Then the UE 100<br>
receives the domain transfer restriction information (message) from the VCC ap-<br>
plication 300, and sends a response message (e.g., Ack message) to the VCC ap-<br>
plication 300 in response to the received information (S3). The UE 100 then stores the<br>
received domain transfer restriction information in a certain memory provided therein<br>
(S4). For instance, the domain transfer restriction information may be stored in a<br>
storage unit within the UE 100 or in an independent or separate medium (or means)<br>
such as a SIM card, other than in the UE. In step S4, if the operator policy including<br>
the domain transfer restriction information therein is received from the VCC ap-<br>
plication 300, then the UE 100 stores the received operator policy including the<br>
domain transfer restriction information (or updates previously stored operator policy<br>
with the received information). However, if only the domain transfer restriction in-<br>
formation is received from the VCC application 300, then the UE 100 stores the<br>
received domain transfer restriction information (or updates previously stored domain<br>
transfer restriction information with the received information) in step S4.<br>
According to the present invention, step S3. may be performed either before or after<br>
step S4. Further, step S3 may be an optional step, which can be omitted. Also, an<br>
ongoing call may be established after step S2. That is, the domain transfer restriction<br>
information can be sent from the VCC application 300 to the UE 100 (S2) before the<br>
call is established or during the ongoing call.<br>
The domain transfer restriction information may include in detail information<br>
associated with a domain transfer restriction, for example, a duration for restricting the<br>
domain transfer, a level of the restriction, a direction of the domain transfer restriction,<br>
and the like. A detailed description of the domain transfer restriction information and<br>
the associated information therein according to the present invention will be explained<br>
in detail hereafter.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the UE shall take into account this domain<br>
transfer restriction information before initiating a domain transfer for an ongoing call<br>
(e.g., an outgoing call in CS or IMS). For instance, the UE 100 analyzes the domain<br>
transfer restriction information, and decides whether the domain transfer for the<br>
ongoing call can be initiated by considering the analyzed domain transfer restriction in-<br>
formation (S5 and S6). As an example only, assume that the domain transfer restriction<br>
information indicates the duration (e.g., the domain transfer shall be restricted from 14<br><br>
pm to 16 pm) and the direction of the domain transfer restriction (e.g., a domain<br>
transfer over the CS domain shall be restricted). Also assume that an ongoing call of<br>
the UE is on over the IMS domain. Under these assumptions, the domain transfer for<br>
the ongoing call of the UE is restricted during the setup duration, from 14 pm to 16<br>
pm, and furthermore the domain transfer from the IMS domain to the CS domain is<br>
restricted. Hence, the UE takes such domain transfer restriction information into<br>
account to decide whether or not to initiate the domain transfer for the ongoing call. If<br>
the domain transfer restriction information allows the domain transfer, then the UE can<br>
initiate the domain transfer of its ongoing call, whereas if the domain transfer re-<br>
striction information does not allow (restricts) the domain transfer, then the UE can<br>
decide not to initiate the domain transfer of its ongoing call.<br>
Hereinafter, the message including the domain transfer restriction information sent<br>
from the network (e.g., VCC application) to the UE (e.g., in step S2) will be explained.<br>
According to an embodiment, the domain transfer restriction information can be sent<br>
from the VCC application to the UE as a message. This message including the domain<br>
transfer restriction information can be sent by use of an Open Mobile Alliance (OMA)<br>
CP/DM (device management) or any other protocol, for example. This message can be<br>
used to upgrade the domain transfer restriction information.<br>
According to an embodiment, the domain transfer restriction information included<br>
in this message contains associated information which includes 1) indication in-<br>
formation and/or 2) network policy information. The indication information and the<br>
network policy information according to an embodiment of the present invention are<br>
discussed in more detail as follows.<br>
Indication information is related to a restriction of a domain transfer, which<br>
includes associated information for the domain transfer restriction. The indication in-<br>
formation includes 1range of applicability information, and/or 2 level of restriction<br>
information and/or 3direction of applicability information,<br>
1 Range of applicability information: this information designates a range for re-<br>
stricting a domain transfer for calls in the network (e.g., VCC application).The range<br>
of applicability information can indicate one or more of the following restrictions on<br>
domain transfer:<br>
•restriction of domain transfer for a specific session/call (e.g., the network cannot<br>
support the domain transfer for a specific call so the domain transfer is restricted (not<br>
permitted));<br>
•restriction of domain transfer for an ongoing session/call (e.g., the network cannot<br>
support the domain transfer for an ongoing call so the domain transfer is restricted);<br>
•restriction of domain transfer until re-registering from an IMS domain and/or a CS<br>
domain;<br><br>
•restriction of domain transfer until power down of the UE (e.g., the domain transfer<br>
is restricted until power of the UE is turned off);<br>
•restriction of domain transfer based on a time period (e.g., the domain transfer is<br>
restricted during a certain time period);and/or<br>
•restriction of domain transfer until a predefined prohibition is cancelled or released<br>
(e.g., if the network imposes a prohibition that no call is to be allowed in a certain area<br>
and if the user moves into or is in that area, then the domain transfer on the call is<br>
restricted since the prohibition is still imposed).<br>
2 Level of restriction information: this is a type of guideline information for<br>
designating a level of restriction with respect to the domain transfer restriction,<br>
examples of which are as follows:<br>
•a first level (so-called 'Shall not' (must not)) used so that the network (i.e., VCC<br>
application) can indicate to the UE not to initiate (perform) the domain transfer (e.g.,<br>
here, any attempt of the UE to initiate the domain transfer will be rejected); or<br>
•a second level (so-called 'Should not' (preferably not)) used when it is intended to<br>
maintain an ongoing call in a specific domain (e.g., this may be available when the UE<br>
attempts to initiate a domain transfer). Here, the UE can consider both the domain<br>
transfer restriction information, and user preference information which can indicate in-<br>
formation pertaining a domain transfer. So based on both information, the UE can<br>
decide whether to initiate a domain transfer. Alternatively, the UE can consider only<br>
the domain transfer restriction info to determine whether or not to initiate a domain<br>
transfer.); or<br>
•a third level (so-called 'is allowed') used to cancel a previous restriction of domain<br>
transfer (e.g., to indicate that a domain transfer can be initiated after notifying the<br>
above levels of restriction). Here, the UE can consider both the domain transfer re-<br>
striction information, and user preference information which can indicate information<br>
pertaining a domain transfer. So based on both information, the UE can decide whether<br>
to initiate the domain transfer. Alternatively, the UE can consider only the domain<br>
transfer restriction information.<br>
These levels (e.g., the first to third levels) can be represented by different values of<br>
a parameter for indicating the levels of the domain transfer restriction, by using<br>
different parameters corresponding to different levels, or by using other ways. Each of<br>
the restrictions listed above, which can be indicated by the range of applicability in-<br>
formation can have the first, second or third level discussed above.<br>
3 Direction of applicability information: this is information for indicating that an<br>
initiation of domain transfer is applicable only in a certain direction. The direction of<br>
applicability information can indicate one of the following:<br>
•Inapplicable in both directions (e.g., from the IMS to CS, and from the CS to IMS);<br><br>
•Inapplicable in an IMS domain; or<br>
•Inapplicable in a CS domain.<br>
For instance, if the direction of applicability information indicates "inapplicable in<br>
an IMS domain", then the domain transfer for an ongoing call is inapplicable (not<br>
applicable or allowed) in the IMS domain.<br>
The network policy information is information for indicating conditions with<br>
respect to the restriction of domain transfer based upon operator policy. Namely, it is<br>
information for indicating that a network indicates the restriction of domain transfer<br>
when a call corresponding to a certain condition or a specific situation takes place from<br>
the UE. Examples of the network policy information are as follows:<br>
•information for indicating not to initiate a domain transfer when placing a<br>
multiparty call or multi-session call;<br>
•information for indicating not to initiate a domain transfer when a cell ID is a<br>
specific ID;<br>
•information for indicating not to initiate a domain transfer in case of an off-state of<br>
a function at a side of a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN);<br>
•information for indicating not to initiate a domain transfer in case of a certain sup-<br>
plementary service (e.g., call hold, call waiting, etc.); and/or<br>
•information for indicating not to initiate a domain transfer in case of an emergency<br>
call.<br>
As aforementioned, the domain transfer restriction information (e.g., the indication<br>
information and/or network policy information) is sent from the VCC application to<br>
the UE by being included in a message, e.g., in a format of parameter (or element). The<br>
VCC application can combines one or more associated information to generate the<br>
domain transfer restriction information to be sent to the UE. For example, if intended<br>
to always restrict a domain transfer of the UE toward an IMS domain, the VCC ap-<br>
plication sends to the UE the corresponding indication information by including it in<br>
the message. In another example, when the UE does not support a domain transfer for<br>
ongoing calls (i.e., a type of indication information), and does not (or should not)<br>
initiate the domain transfer even if a multiparty call is placed (i.e., a type of network<br>
policy information), the VCC application includes the corresponding indication in-<br>
formation and network policy information in the message to be sent to the UE.<br>
Hereinafter, constructions and operations of the UE 100 and VCC application 300<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention will be explained.<br>
The UE 100 according to the present invention may comprise a basic hardware con-<br>
struction to generate and process domain transfer restriction information.<br>
For instance, as shown in Fig. 4, the UE 100 according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention may comprise a receiver 43 for receiving domain transfer restriction<br><br>
information from the VCC application 300, a transmitter 41 for transmitting an Ack<br>
message in response to the received domain transfer restriction information, a memory<br>
or storage unit 42 for storing the received domain transfer restriction information and<br>
other information such as operator policy, user preferences, etc. and a VCC enabler<br>
(controller) 46 for analyzing the domain transfer restriction information, deciding<br>
whether a domain transfer for an ongoing call can or should be initiated and then<br>
attempting the domain transfer according to the decision. Here, the VCC enabler may<br>
be a controller as a type of controlling unit for analyzing the domain transfer restriction<br>
information in order to decide on whether or not to initiate the domain transfer. The<br>
UE 100 may also include other components such as a Ut interface unit 47, a DM unit<br>
48, an input unit 44, and a display unit 45. All components of the UE 100 are op-<br>
eratively coupled.<br>
Thus, the operation and function of each component of the UE which includes<br>
technical features of the present invention have been explained. Besides, other basic<br>
components of the UE for receiving a VCC service are obvious to those skilled in the<br>
art, and the discussion thereof is thus omitted.<br>
The VCC application 300 according to an embodiment of the present invention may<br>
comprise a message generator for generating a message including domain transfer re-<br>
striction information in response to a change in a network state or operator policy with<br>
respect to the domain transfer for the network maintenance, a transmitter for<br>
transmitting the generated message to the UE, and a receiver for receiving an Ack<br>
message sent by the UE in response to the message including the domain transfer re-<br>
striction information. Here, the message generator may be a type of controller because<br>
it generates the message for the purpose of restricting the domain transfer.<br>
The present invention has been explained with reference to embodiments illustrated<br>
in the drawings, which, however, are just exemplary. It will also be apparent to those<br>
skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present<br>
invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus, it is<br>
intended that the present invention cover modifications and variations of this invention<br>
provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.<br>
As described above, the present invention is effective for the UE to recognize a<br>
network state for domain transfer based upon domain transfer restriction information.<br>
That is, when a domain transfer for a call is restricted due to a change in operator<br>
policy or for some other reason/cause, a network in the VCC (i.e., VCC application)<br>
can send to the VCC UE the domain transfer restriction information, so that the UE can<br>
be aware of the network state and/or the domain transfer restriction information.<br>
Also, in the present invention, from the UE (i.e., terminal) perspective, since the UE<br>
can attempt to initiate the domain transfer by taking a current network state into<br><br>
account (based on the domain transfer restriction information), it is effective to prevent<br>
unnecessary attempts or initiations of domain transfer by the VCC UE.<br>
In addition, the present invention can prevent consumption of signaling and radio<br>
resources due to unnecessarily initiated domain transfers, which prevents wasting of<br>
the UE battery and CPU power due to unnecessary signaling.<br><br>
