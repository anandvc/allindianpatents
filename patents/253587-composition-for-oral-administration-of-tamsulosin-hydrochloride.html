				<td>COMPOSITION FOR ORAL ADMINISTRATION OF TAMSULOSIN<br>
HYDROCHLOREDE AND CONTROLLED RELEASE GRANULE FORMULATION<br>
COMPRISING SAME<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a composition for oral administration of<br>
tamsulosin hydTocbJoride, which exhibits an excellent stability and a sustained release of<br>
tamsulosin hydrochioride, and a controlled release granule formulation comprising the<br>
same.<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
Tamsulosin hydrochioride are currently available for treating benign prostatic<br>
hypertrophy, and there have been made many attempts to develop a controlled release<br>
formulation of tamsulosin hydrochioride having^ood stability and an extended release<br>
rate. For example, European Patent Publication No. 80341A discloses an oral<br>
formulation for controlled release of tamsulosin which contains multiple drug<br>
preparations; and Korean Patent Publication No. 1993-7245 discloses a controlled<br>
release formulation for oral use comprising the drug, an aggregate-forming agent such as<br>
cellulose, chitin and chitosan, and an insoluble polymer. However the stability and the<br>
release characteristics of these formulations fluctuate unsatisfactorily depending on the<br>
retained food or pH changes in the gastroenteric organs.<br>
The present inventors have endeavored to develop a composition having good<br>
stability and sustained release characteristics of tamsulosin hydrochioride under any<br>
digestive conditions; and have unexpectedly found that a composition comprising<br>
tamsulosin hydrochioride, polyvinyl acetate and a water-soluble<br>
hydroxypropylmethylcellulose is particularly suitable for oral administration.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, it is a primary object of the present invention to provide a novel<br>
tamsulosin hydrochloride composition which exhibits high stability and satisfactory<br>
sustained release characteristics of tamsulosin hydrochloride upon oral administration.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a controlled release<br>
granule formulation comprising said composition.<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a<br>
composition for oral administration of tamsulosin hydrochloride comprising tamsolosin<br>
hydrochloride, polyvinylacetate, and a water-soluble hydToxypropylTnethylcellulose.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a<br>
sustained release granule of tamsulosin hydrochloride comprising tamsulosin<br>
hydrochloride, polyvinylacetate, a water-soluble nydroxvpropylmethyfcellulose, and a<br>
granulating agent.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
The above and other objects and features of the present invention will become<br>
apparent from the following description of the invention, when taken in conjunction with<br>
the accompanying drawings, which respectively show: :<br>
FIG. 1: Dissolution profiles of tamsulosin hydrochloride observed for the hard<br>
capsule prepared in Example 17 and Hamal capsule (Jeil Pharm., Korea);<br>
FIGs. 2A and 2B: Dissolution profiles of tamsulosin hydrochloride observed for<br>
the hard capsule prepared in Example 17 (A) and Harmal capsule (B) after storage for 10<br>
days under the condition of Test Example 2; and<br>
FIGs. 3A and 3B: Microscopic photographs of the coated granule prepared in<br>
Example 15 (A) and the granule of Harnal capsule (B).<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The composition of the present invention comprises tamsulosin hydrochloride,<br>
polyvinylacetate, and a water-soluble hydroxypropylcellulose.<br>
The inventive composition may further comprise various granulating agents,<br>
coating materials, and pharmaceutically acceptable additives.<br>
Each ingredient of the inventive composition and granule formulation is<br>
described in detail as follows.<br>
Tamsulosia hvdrocMoride<br>
Tamsulosin hydrochloride, the active ingredient of the inventive cornposrtron.<br>
has a low water-solubility. A typical daily do of tamsulosin hydrochloride in case of<br>
treating urination disorder accompanying benign prostatic hypertrophy ranges from 0.2<br>
to 0.8 mg, and it should be administered once a day 30 min before a meal. However, i:<br>
should be understood mat the dosage of tamsulosin hydrochloride should be determined<br>
in light of various relevant factors including the condition to be treated, the severity of<br>
the patient's symptoms, the route of administration, or the physiological form of the<br>
anrkancer agent; and therefore, the dosage suggested above should 4iot be construed to<br>
limit the scope of the invention in anyway.<br>
Polwinylacetate<br>
Polyvinylacetate plays an important role in assisting granulating agent in the<br>
process of forming granules and maintaining pores formed in the granules for some<br>
period of time after the inventive granule formulation is dissolved in an aqueous medium.<br>
Consequently, polyvinylacetate confers on the composition of the inventive composition<br>
with sustained release capability of the active ingredient for an extended period of time<br>
regardless of pH of the aqueous medium.<br>
In the inventive composition, polyvinylacetate may be used alone or in the form<br>
of a mixture with other pharmaceutically acceptable materials, preferably in the form of<br>
a powder or a suspension containing more than 30% by weight or more of<br>
polyvinylacetate.<br>
For example, Kollidon SRÂ® (BASF), a powder prepared by mixing<br>
polyvinylacetate and polyvinylpyrrolidone at a ratio of 8:2 (w/w) and spray-drying the<br>
mixture, and Kollicoat SR30DÂ® (solid content: 30%, BASF), a suspension (or a diluted<br>
aqueous solution) prepared by mixing polyvinylacetate, polyvinylpyrrolidone and<br>
sodium lauryl sulfate, and suspending the mixture in water, may be used in the present<br>
invention as a source of polyvinylacetate. In addition, any pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
material may be used as a source of polyvinylacetate insofar as it contains 30% by<br>
weight or more of polyvmylacetate.<br>
Polyvinylacetate may be employed hi the inventive composition in an amount<br>
ranging from 20 to 1000 parts by weight, preferably 40 to 600 parts by weight more<br>
preferably 50 to 300 parts by weight based on 1 part by weight of tamsulosin<br>
hydrochloride.<br>
Water-soluble hydroxypropylmethvlcellulose<br>
A water=soiuble hydroxypropylmethylcelkilose (HPMC) controls the<br>
initial-phase release of the active ingredient by forming pores, through which the active<br>
ingredient is released. In order to obtain a desired sustained release pattern, it is<br>
preferable to employ a water-soluble HPMC having a high viscosity, and the desired<br>
effect may not be achieved when a low-viscosity water-soluble HPMC is employed.<br>
Therefore, the water-soluble HPMC having a high viscosity of more than 10,000 cps,<br>
preferably 15,000 to 100,000 cps, is used in the present invention, and representative<br>
examples thereof include METOLOSE 60SH, 65SH and 90SH (Shin-Etsu).<br>
The water-soluble HPMC may be used in an amount ranging from 0.1 to 500<br>
parts by weight, preferably 1 to 100 parts by weight, more preferably 2 to 50 parts by<br>
weight based on 1 part by weight of tamsulosin hydrochloride.<br>
A controlled release granule formulation prepared by using the inventive<br>
composition may further comprise the following ingredients.<br>
Granulating agent<br>
The inventive granule formulation may comprise a granulating agent and<br>
examples thereof include microcrystalline cellulose, lactose and inorganic carrier such as<br>
dibasic calcium phosphate, dibasic calcium phosphate dihydrate and tribasic calcium<br>
phosphate, wherein microcrystalline cellulose and dibasic calcium phosphate (e.g.<br>
A-TabÂ®, Rhodia) are prefered.<br>
The granulating agent may be used in an amount ranging from 1 to 2000 parts<br>
by weight, preferably 10 to 1000 parts by weight based on 1 part by weight of tamsuiosin<br>
hydrochloride.<br>
Coating material<br>
The inventive granule formulation of tamsuiosin hydrochloride may further be<br>
coated with a conventional enteric coating material or a polymeric coating material for<br>
the purpose of precisely controlling the absorption of the active ingredient in the<br>
gastrointestinal treat.<br>
Examples of the enteric coating material include hydroxypropylmethylcellulose<br>
phthalate, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose acetate succinate, polyvinylacetate phthalate,<br>
cellulose acetate phthalate, shellac, methacrylate-methylmethacrylate copolymer and<br>
metfiacrylate-ethylacrylate copolymer. Examples of the polymeric coating material<br>
include hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, methylcellulose, ethylcellulose, polyvinylacetate<br>
and a mixture thereof.<br>
The coating material may be employed in an amount ranging from 0.2 to 100<br>
parts by weight, preferably 1 to 50 parts by weight based on the amount 1 part by weight<br>
of tamsuiosin hydrochloride.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable additives<br>
The inventive granule formulation may further comprise conventional<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable additives for preparing it into various formulations, and<br>
exemplary pharmaceutically acceptable additive include a conventional plasticizer,<br>
lubricant and other aid.<br>
The pharmaceutical acceptable additive may be employed in an amount ranging<br>
from 0.1 to 500 parts by weight, preferably 1 to 200 parts by weight, more preferably 2<br>
to 50 parts by weight based on 1 part by weight of tamsulosin hydrochloride.<br>
The inventive cojjapasition of tamsulosin fajdEoehloride may be formulated into<br>
a graauk formulation by a conventional method onrnprismg me steps of (i) raixiag the<br>
composition with a granulating agent, and (ii) subjecting the mixture to wet grinding,<br>
compression molding and spheronizing to obtain a wet granule. The granule may be<br>
further coated with a coating material dissolved in water to obtain a coated granule. If<br>
necessary, the granule may be further mixed with pharmaceutical acceptable additives<br>
and filled into a hard gelatin capsule to obtain a capsule formulation.<br>

Test Example 1: Dissolution Test<br>
A dissolution test for tamsulostn hydrochloride was conducted using the capsule<br>
obtained in Example 17 and Harnal (Jeil Pharm.) capsule as a comparative preparation as<br>
follows.<br>
500 ml of artificial gastric juice (pH 1.2) containing 1 ml of Tween 80 was used<br>
as test solution (1). Each treat capsule was added to test solution (1), the mixture was<br>
agitated at 37Â±0.5Â°C and 100 rpm for 2 hours, and a 10 ml sample was taken from the<br>
test solution (1). Then, the test solution (1) was changed with test solution (2), 500 ml<br>
of a phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), the same agitating procedure was repeated, and 10 ml<br>
samples were taken from the test solution (2) at hour 1 and 3 after the start of the<br>
agitation, respectively. The sample taken from the test solution (1) was mixed with 2.0<br>
ml of an internal standard (propyl parahydroxybenzoate dissolved in a mixture of<br>
water:acetonitrile=7:3), while each of the samples taken from the test solution (2) was<br>
mixed with a mixture of 0.5 N HC1 and 2.0 ml of the internal standard. The resulting<br>
mixture was filtered through a 0.5 \im membrane filter, and subjected to liquid<br>
chromatography (column: Cosmosil (ODS) (4.6x150 mm, 5um) C&gt;g; temperature: 40Â°C;<br>
mobile phase: aqueous HC1O4 (adjusted to pH 2.0 using NaOH);acetonitrile=7:3; flow<br>
rate: 1.0 ml/min; injection volume: 500 ul; and wave length: 225 nm) to analyze the<br>
time-dependent released amount of tarnsulosin hydrochloride. The results are shown in<br>
FIG. 1.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, the capsule of the present invention and Harnal capsule<br>
exhibited similar tamsulosin hydrochloride release patterns regardless of the pH.<br>
Test Example 2: Stability Test<br>
12 of the hard capsules obtained in Example 17 and 12 of Harnal capsule (Jeil<br>
Pharm.) were each placed into a HDPE bottle. Then, the bottle was sealed, and kept at<br>
60Â°C, or at 40Â°C and 75% relative humidity (a stress condition).<br>
At days 0, 10 or 30 of in such treatment, each residual percentage of tamsulosin<br>
hydrochloride in the inventive or Harnal capsule was analyzed using a liquid<br>
chromatography, and the results is listed in Table I.<br>
Further, using the inventive and Hamal capsules kepted for 10 days under the<br>
above stress condition, the procedure of Test Example 1 was repeated. The results are<br>
shown in FIGs. 2A (the inventive capsule) and 2B (Hamal capsule).<br>
As the results show, the inventive capsule of tamsulosin hydrochloride exhibited<br>
high stability and good sustained release charateristics of tamsulosin hydrochloride,<br>
comparable to Harnal capsule.<br>
Test Example 3: Sphericity Test<br>
10-granule particles of the coated granule obtained in Example 15 and &amp;ose of<br>
Harnal capsule were each examined using a microscope (Nikkon SMZ8QO). On each<br>
microscopic photograph, a least circumscribed circle of the granule was drawn, and the<br>
distance from the circumcenter and surface of the granule was measured to obtam the<br>
minimum distance (A) and maximum distance (B). The sphericity of each granule was<br>
evaluated by A/B, and the results are listed in Table n.<br>
The results in Table n suggest that the granule of the present invention is more<br>
spherical than the granule of Harnal, for the average A/B of the inventive granule was<br>
closer to 1 than the comparative granule. Thus, composition of the present invention is<br>
capable of forming uniform granules.<br>
As can be seen from the above, the inventive composition for oral administration<br>
of tamsulosin hydrochloride having high stability, a good sustained release rate of the<br>
active ingredient and the capability for forming uniform granules can be advantageously<br>
used in various fields including medical science and pharmaceutical chemistry.<br>
While the invention has been described with respect to the specific embodiments,<br>
it should be recognized that various modifications and changes may be made by those<br>
skilled in the art to the invention which also fall within the scope of the invention as<br>
defined by the appended claims.<br><br><br><br><br>
We claim:<br>
1.	A composition for oral administration of tamsulosin hydrochloride comprising tamsulosin<br>
hydrochloride, polyvinylacetate, and a water-soluble hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, wherein the<br>
amount of polyvinylacetate ranges from 20 to 1000 parts by weight based on 1 part by weight<br>
