As shown in Scheme 1, in a method of the present invention a compound of Formula 1 is prepared by contacting a compound of Formula 2 with a metal cyanide reagent, a copper(I) salt reagent, an iodide salt reagent and at least one compound of Formula 3<br>
Scheme 1<br>
(Scheme Removed) <br>
In the present method the metal cyanide reagent particularly comprises at least one compound selected from the group consisting of alkali metal cyanides or alkali metal hexacyanoferrates(II) Suitable alkali metal cyanides include compounds of the formula M'CN (i e Formula 6, as described above in the Embodiments), wherein M1 is an alkali metal such as sodium or potassium Suitable alkali metal hexacyanoferrates(II) include, for example, potassium hexacyanoferrate(II) and sodium hexacyanoferrate(II), both of which are commercially available at low cost are non-toxic easy to handle, and have six cyanide ions available for transfer to compounds of Formula 2 Highest yields of Formula 1 compounds are usually achieved when using a metal cyanide reagent comprising sodium cyanide Typically the cyanide equivalent ratio of the metal cyanide reagent relative to the compound<br>
of Formula 2 is from about 1 to about 1 5, and more preferably from about 1 15 to about 1 25 When using alkali metal cyanides, reducing the particle size of the alkali metal cyanides prior to use can facilitate optimal yields of Formula 1 compounds Grinding or milling alkali metal cyanides before use can provide smaller particle size material<br>
In the method of Scheme 1, copper(I) is believed to act as a source of a chemical species which catalyzes the conversion of Formula 2 compounds to Formula 1 Suitable copper(I) salt reagents comprise one or more compounds selected from the group consisting of copper(I) salts such as copper(I) iodide, copper(I) bromide, copper(I) chloride, copper(I) cyanide and copper(I) tnflate (CUOSO2CF3) The mole ratio of the copper(I) salt reagent (based on Cu(I)) to the compound of Formula 2 is from about 0 01 to about 1, and preferably from about 0 1 to about 0 99, and more preferably from about 0 1 to about 0 4 When Y is Br, most preferred are mole ratios from about 0 15 to about 0 2 of the copper(I) salt to the compound of Formula 2 When Y is CI, most preferred are mole ratios from about 0 3 to about 0 4 of the copper(I) salt to the compound of Formula 2<br>
Without being bound by any particular theory, it is believed under the conditions of the present method a 5-(bromo or chloro)benzoic acid or derivative of Formula 2 is converted to the corresponding 5-iodobenzoic acid or derivative in the presence of an iodide salt Suitable iodide salt reagents compnse one or more compounds selected from the group consisting of quaternary ammonium, alkali and alkaline earth metal iodide salts such as copper(I) iodide, sodium iodide, potassium iodide, zinc iodide, lithium iodide, calcium iodide, tetrabutylammonium iodide and tetramethylammonium iodide The mole ratio of the iodide salt to the compound of Formula 2 is from about 0 001 to about 1, and preferably from about 0 05 to about 0 4, and more preferably from about 0 1 to about 0 4<br>
In the method of Scheme 1 highest yields of Formula 1 compounds with optimal reaction rates are often obtained when copper(I) iodide is used as the source of the copper(I) salt reagent and the iodide salt reagent When copper(I) iodide is used in the present method typically the mole ratio is from about 0 1 to about 0 4 relative to the compound of Formula 2 In some cases it may be beneficial to use copper(I) iodide in combination with another iodide salt reagent, such as sodium iodide, potassium iodide, zinc iodide, tetrabutylammonium iodide or tetramethylammonium iodide The usefulness of copper(I) iodide plus another iodide salt reagent depends on the specific reaction conditions and substrate Typically optimal yields of Formula 1 compounds can be obtained from the present process simply by using copper(I) iodide as the only source of iodide salt reagent<br>
Compounds of Formula 3 are bidentate chelating ligands comprising nitrogen and/or nitrogen-oxygen binding sites These ligands have been found to accelerate the rate of conversion of compounds of Formula 2 to Formula 1 Without being bound by any particular theory the ligands are thought to facilitate the reaction by increasing the solubility and/or reactivity of the copper(I) catalyst via the formation a copper-ligand complex<br>
Compounds of Formula 3 wherein X is NR13 are preferred such as, but not limited to, aliphatic diamines In the method of Scheme 1 typically the highest yields of Formula 1 compounds and the most favorable reaction rates are achieved with the use of one or more of the following commercially available ligands N,N-dimethylethylenediamine, N,N'-di-methyl-l,3-propanediamine or 2,2-dimethyI-l,3-propanediamine The mole ratio of Formula 3 compounds to the copper(I) salt reagent is typically from about 1 to about 10 As mole ratios greater than 1 can often accelerate the reaction while ratios above 6 generally offer little additional benefit while increasing cost, the ratio is preferably from about 4 to about 6 Besides facilitating the reaction, using mole ratios of compounds of Formula 3 to the copper(I) salt reagent of greater than 1 has been discovered to reduce the level of residual copper impurities remaining in the desired product after simple purification such as dilution with water, filtration, washing with water and optionally an organic solvent When N,N-di-methylethylenediamine is used as the hgand, typically mole ratios of at least about 5 relative to the copper(I) salt reagent are effective in minimizing the presence of residual copper impurities in the Formula 1 products<br>
The reaction of Scheme 1 is typically conducted in a suitable organic solvent A variety of solvents can be used to form the suitable solvent for this method Typically, the method is most satisfactorily conducted using solvents in which compounds of Formula 2 are preferably completely or at least substantially soluble and the metal cyanide reagent has a low solubility in the volume of solvents used and at ordinary ambient temperatures Examples of suitable solvents include halogenated and nonhalogenated aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons such as heptane, xylenes, toluene, chlorobenzene, 1,2,4-tnmethyl-benzene, 1,3,5-tnmethylbenzene, ethylbenzene, (l-methylethyl)benzene (also known as cumene) and C1-C3 alkyl-substituted naphthalenes (e g, 1-methylnaphthalene, 2-methyl-naphthalene, 1,5-dimethylnaphthalene, 2,6-dimethylnaphthalene and 1,3-dimethyl-naphthalene) Of particular note as the solvent is 1,2-dimethlybenzene (o-xylene), 1,3-dimethylbenzene (m-xylene), 1,4-dimethylbenzene (p-xylene) or an isomeric mixture thereof, which is commonly known as xylenes When Y is Br, the reaction has been discovered to rapidly proceed in xylene solvents at temperatures near the normal boiling points of the solvents to often provide products in superior yield and/or purity Although a single xylene isomer (1 e o-xylene, m-xylene or p-xylene) can be used as the solvent, use of the isomeric mixture of xylenes is commercially preferable as it provides equally good results at lower cost When Y is CI, solvents that allow for reaction temperatures between about 160 and 200 °C are preferred This can be accomplished by using a solvent with a boiling point within or above this range or by operating at elevated pressure with a lower boiling solvent such as xylenes When Y is CI, 1-methylnaphthalene is a particularly useful solvent The volume of the organic solvent relative to the weight of the compound of Formula 2 is typically between about 2 mL/g and about 10 mL/g    Amounts of solvent<br>
greater than 2 mL/g can facilitate stirring the reaction mixture, but larger amounts of solvent can slow the reaction as well as increase cost, so preferably the volume of solvent to the weight of the compound Formula 2 is between about 3 mL/g and about 6 mL/g<br>
In the present method, the order in which the reactants are combined is not critical to the outcome of the reaction However, for preparing compounds of Formula 1 the most preferred order of combination has been found to comprise combining the compound of Formula 2 with the suitable organic solvent to form a mixture, and then sequentially adding the metal cyanide reagent, the copper(I) salt reagent, the iodide salt reagent and the compound or compounds of Formula 3 to the mixture For preparing compounds of Formula 1, it has been found advantageous to purge the reaction mixture with an inert gas such as nitrogen or argon, particularly prior to the addition of the metal cyanide reagent Therefore an embodiment of note of the present method comprises the steps of combining the compound of Formula 2 with the suitable organic solvent to form a mixture, adding the metal cyanide reagent to the mixture, followed by the copper(I) salt reagent, the iodide salt reagent, purging with an inert gas, and then adding the compound or compounds of Formula 3<br>
The present method is typically conducted at a temperature between about 115 and 200 °C and more typically between about 120 and 190 °C When Y is Br, temperatures between about 120 and 160 °C often achieve the highest product yield and purity with the most favorable reaction rates, for example, in most cases compounds of Formula 1 are obtained in greater than 95% yields in about 3 to about 4 h When Y is CI, temperatures between about 160 and 200 °C, and more typically between about 170 and 180 °C, often provide favorable reaction rates<br>
The product of Formula 1 can be isolated by standard techniques known in the art, including filtration, extraction, evaporation and crystallization For example, the reaction medium can be diluted with about 2 to 8 parts by weight of water relative to the compound of Formula 2 to dissolve inorganic salts that are present in the reaction medium As the compounds of Formula 1 are typically solids at ambient temperature and generally sparingly soluble in the reaction solvent, they are most easily isolated by filtration, followed by washing with water and optionally an organic solvent, such as the reaction solvent (e g, xylenes) If the compounds of Formula 1 are soluble in the reaction solvent, they are most conveniently isolated by diluting the reaction medium with water to dissolve inorganic salts, then separating the organic phase, optionally followed by washing with water, to remove residual amounts of salts and/or metal cyanides, and then removal of the solvent by distillation or evaporation at reduced pressure In some cases it may be advantageous to add a water-soluble copper chelating agent such as 2,2'-thiodiethanol prior to isolation of compounds of Formula 1 to optimize the removal of copper Compounds of Formula 1 can be further purified by recrystallization from an appropriate organic solvent    Examples of<br>
appropriate solvents include alcohols, such as methanol The method of Scheme 1 is illustrated in Examples 2-5 below<br>
The features of the present method provide an efficient means to produce 3-substituted 2-ammo-5-cyanobenzoic acid derivatives of Formula 1 in typically high yields (&gt;95%), in 3 to 6 h, while using inexpensive reagents Of particular note is that the present method can be used to provide remarkably high yields of the compounds of Formula 1 in excellent punty even though these compounds as well as the starting compounds of Formula 2 contain amino substituents and in some cases amide substituents that can potentially participate in side reactions<br>
As shown in Scheme 2, starting compounds of Formula 2 can be prepared by halogenation of a compound of Formula 7 using a variety of reagents known in the literature including bromine, chlorine, sulfuryl chloride, N-chlorosuccinimide (NCS), /V-bromosuccinimide (NBS) and halogenating reagents such as mixtures comprising hydrogen penoxide and a hydrogen hahde For leading references describing these methods, see PCT Patent Publications WO 1998/16503 (Scheme 4 and Example 132), WO 2006/068669 (Scheme 11), WO 2003/015519 (Scheme 4 and Example 1, Step A) and WO 2006/062978 (Scheme 15, Example 4, Step B and Example 5, Step B)<br>
Scheme 2<br>
(Scheme Removed) <br>
Compounds of Formula 2a (Formula 2 wherein R1 is NHR3) can also be prepared by contacting an isatoic anhydride of Formula 8 with an alkyl amine of Formula 9 in the presence of a carboxylic acid as illustrated in Scheme 3<br>
Scheme 3<br>
(Scheme Removed) <br>
As amines such as the compound of Formula 9 are bases, in the absence of the carboxylic acid the mixture of the compounds of Formulae 8 and 9 would be basic (e g, effective pH &gt; 7)    The carboxylic acid acts as a buffer to reduce the effective pH of the<br>
reaction mixture A wide variety of carboxylic acids are useful, as the only requirement is for at least one carboxylic acid group to impart acidity Other functional groups can be present, and more than one carboxylic acid group can be present on the carboxylic acid molecule Typically the carboxylic acid has an effective pKa in the range of about 2 to about 5 Carboxylic acids include, for example, formic acid, propionic acid, chloroacetic acid, benzoic acid, phthahc acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid and citnc acid For reason of cost, inexpensive carboxylic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid and benzoic acid are preferred Acetic acid, which is commercially available at low cost in its anhydrous form (known as "glacial acetic acid"), is particularly preferred<br>
The combination of the carboxylic acid with the basic amine of Formula 9 forms an amine salt of the carboxylic acid This amine salt can be preformed before addition of the isatoic anhydride compound of Formula 8, or the amine salt can be generated in situ by metering the amine of Formula 9 into a mixture of the compound of Formula 8 and the carboxylic acid For either mode of addition, maintaining the effective pH of the mixture during the reaction between about 3 and about 7 is generally best<br>
As the effective pH of the mixture results from the buffering effect of the carboxylic acid in combination with the amine of Formula 9, the effective pH can be adjusted according to the effective pKa of the carboxylic acid by adjusting the molar ratio of carboxylic acid to amine of Formula 9 Typically the molar amounts of the amine of Formula 9 to carboxylic acid are in the range from about 0 8 to about 3 More particularly, when the mode of combination involves metering the amine of Formula 9 into a mixture of the isatoic anhydnde compound of Formula 8 and carboxylic acid, the molar ratio of Formula 9 amine to carboxylic acid is preferably from about 0 95 to about 3 When the mode of combination involves forming the amine salt before addition of the compound of Formula 8 the molar ratio of Formula 9 amine to carboxylic acid is preferably from about 0 8 to about 1 05, as long as a nearly equimolar ratio (e g, about 0 95 to about 1 05) of Formula 9 amine to carboxylic acid is used, the amine salt thus formed is typically used in a ratio of about 1 1 to about 5 molar equivalents relative to the compound of Formula 8 For optimal conversions, the molar ratio of amine of Formula 9 to isatoic anhydnde compound of Formula 8 should be at least 1 although the molar ratio is preferred to be from about 1 1 to about 1 5 for reasons of efficiency and of economy, regardless of how the components are mixed The molar amount of amine of Formula 9 relative to compound of Formula 8 can be substantially greater than 1 5, particularly when a nearly equimolar ratio (e g , about 0 95 to about 1 05) of amine to acid is used<br>
Highest product yield and purity is achieved when the reaction medium is substantially anhydrous The reaction medium is thus typically formed from substantially anhydrous compounds of Formula 8 and 9 and carboxylic acid Preferably the reaction medium and forming materials contain about 5% or less, more preferably about 1% or less  and most<br>
preferably about 0 1% water or less (by weight)   If the carboxyhc acid is acetic acid, it is preferably in the form of glacial acetic acid<br>
The reaction of Scheme 3 is typically conducted in a liquid phase In many cases the reaction can be earned out without solvent other than the compounds of Formulae 2a, 8 and 9 and the carboxyhc acid But a preferred procedure involves use of a solvent that can suspend and at least partially dissolve the reactants Preferred solvents are diose which are non-reactive with the reaction components and have a dielectric constant of about 5 or greater, such as alkyl nitnles, esters, ethers, or ketones Preferably the solvent should be substantially anhydrous to facilitate achieving a substantially anhydrous reaction medium The weight ratio of solvent to the compound of Formula 8 is typically from about 1 to about 20, and preferably about 5 for reasons of efficiency and economy<br>
Carbon dioxide forms as a byproduct of the reaction of Scheme 3 Most of the carbon dioxide formed evolves from the reaction medium as a gas The addition of the compound of Formula 8 into reaction medium containing the amine of Formula 9 or the addition of the amine of Formula 9 into the reaction medium containing the compound of Formula 8 is preferably conducted at such a rate and temperature as to facilitate controlling the evolution of carbon dioxide The temperature of the reaction medium is typically between about 5 and 75 °C, more typically between about 35 and 55 °C<br>
Compounds of Formula 2a can be isolated by standard techniques known in the art, including pH adjustment, extraction, evaporation, crystallization and chromatography For example, the reaction medium can be diluted with about 3 to 15 parts by weight of water relative to the starting compound of Formula 8, the pH can be optionally adjusted with either acid or base to optimize the removal of either acidic or basic impurities, the water phase can be optionally separated, and most of the organic solvent can be removed by distillation or evaporation at reduced pressure As the compounds of Formula 2a are typically crystalline solids at ambient temperature, they are generally most easily isolated by filtration, optionally followed by washing with water and then drying<br>
As shown in Scheme 4, isatoic anhydrides of Formula 8 can be prepared from anthranilic acids of Formula 2b (Formula 2 wherein R1 is OR4 and R4 is H) via a cychzation reaction involving treatment of the anthranilic acids with phosgene or a phosgene equivalent such as tnphosgene or an alkyl chloroformate (e g, methyl chloroformate) in a suitable solvent such as toluene or tetrahydrofuran The method is described in PCT Publication WO 2006/068669, including a specific example relevant to Scheme 4 For other references, see Coppola, Synthesis 1980 505 and Fabis et al   Tetrahedron, 1998, 10789<br>

Scheme 4<br>
(Scheme Removed) <br>
Schemes 2 and 3 illustrate just two methods of preparing a compound of Formula 2  In another method of the present invention a compound of Formula 2 (wherein R1 is NHR3 and Y is Br) can be prepared by introducing a gas containing bromine into a liquid containing a compound of Formula 4 as shown in Scheme 5<br>
Scheme 5<br>
(Scheme Removed) <br>
In the method of Scheme 5 the liquid containing the compound of Formula 4 is a liquid phase in which the compound of Formula 4 is suspended, partially dissolved or completely dissolved, but preferably at least partially dissolved The liquid phase can comprise organic solvents that are substantially anhydrous or, alternatively, aqueous mixtures of organic solvents The solvents should be non-reactive with bromine at temperatures to which the reaction might be heated (e g , about 90 °C) Organic solvents suitable for forming the liquid include, for example, aliphatic carboxylic acids such as acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid, and amides such as N,N-dimethylformamide and N,N-dimethylacetarrude, and mixtures thereof Acetic acid, which is commercially available at low cost is preferred Either the anhydrous form of acetic acid (known as "glacial acetic acid") or aqueous mixtures of acetic acid can be used in the present method The total volume of the solvents relative to the weight of the compound of Formula 4 is typically between about 2 mL/g and about 10 mL/g, and preferably between about 6 mL/g and 10 mL/g If the liquid phase comprises water, preferably the volume of water relative to the weight of the compound of Formula 4 is between about 1 5 mL/g and about 2 mL/g<br>
As the method of Scheme 5 generates hydrobromic acid the reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of a base capable of binding to hydrobromic acid   Although the<br>
product of Formula 2 forms in the absence of a base, in some cases high concentrations of hydrobromic acid in the reaction mixture can inhibit bromination and lead to reduced yields A variety of bases are suitable for reducing the presence of hydrobromic acid in the reaction mixture, including alkali metal hydroxides, carbonates and bicarbonates (e g, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium bicarbonate), organic bases (e g , tnethylamine, tert-butylamine) and alkali metal salts of carboxyhc acids (e g, sodium acetate, potassium acetate, sodium propionate and potassium propionate) In the present method, the base preferably comprises one or more compounds selected from alkali metal hydroxides and alkali metal salts of carboxyhc acids Most preferably the base comprises sodium hydroxide or sodium acetate The mole ratio of the base to the compound of Formula 4 is typically from about 1 to about 1 2, and preferably from about 1 1 to about 1 15 The base can be added in anhydrous form or as an aqueous mixture For example, in the present method if sodium hydroxide is used it is typically added to the reaction mixture as an aqueous solution (e g , 3 M) If an aqueous mixture of a base is used, the total amount of water added to the reaction mixture, including the water added with the base plus water added at any other time during the course of the reaction (e g, water in aqueous organic solvents), is typically within the ranges described above<br>
The method of Scheme 5 is earned out using gaseous bromine The term gaseous bromine means bromine gas, vapor or mist that can be handled like a gas Liquid bromine is most conveniently used as the source for generating gaseous bromine, although any other source for gaseous bromine can be used Liquid bromine is preferred (as the source of gaseous bromine) because it is readily available at relatively low cost and because it has a relatively high vapor pressure, thus allowing gas to be easily evaporated from the liquid In the method of Scheme 5 the liquid bromine is typically at ambient temperature, however it can be heated if desired, as the vapor pressure of liquid bromine increases with increasing temperature In either case, the gaseous bromine is best introduced below the surface of the reaction mixture to ensure high conversion of compounds of Formula 4 to compounds of Formula 2 and to minimize bromine loss If liquid bromine is used to supply gaseous bromine, the gaseous bromine can be added to the reaction mixture by connecting the vessel containing the reaction mixture to another vessel containing the liquid bromine, then flowing an inert gas (e g , nitrogen) below the surface of the liquid bromine, and allowing bromine vapor entrained in the nitrogen gas to flow out of the vessel containing the liquid bromine and to enter the vessel containing the reaction mixture, most preferably below the surface of the reaction mixture The vessels containing the reaction mixture and the liquid bromine, and the equipment connected to these vessels (e g dip tubes) should be made of materials compatible with bromine and bromide (e g , glass Teflon®, and corrosion resistant metal alloys such as Hastelloy®)   For optimal yields of Formula 2 compounds the mole ratio of<br>
bromine to compounds of Formula 4 is typically from about 0 95 to about 1 1, and the concentration of bromine in the inert gas is typically in the range of about 0 005 to about 0 02 moles per liter inert gas<br>
In the method of Scheme 5 the preferred order of combination has been found to comprise combining the compound of Formula 4 with the one or more solvents and then adding gaseous bromine If a base is used the compound of Formula 4 is typically first combined with the one or more solvents, and then the base is added, followed by addition of gaseous bromine<br>
The method of Scheme 5 is typically conducted between about 25 and 90 °C and more typically between about 45 and 60 °C To achieve reaction m this temperature range, the components are typically combined at about ambient temperature (e g , about 15-40 °C) and then the temperature of the reaction mixture is raised to between about 45 and 60 °C More preferably, the liquid containing the compound of Formula 4 is combined with the base, the temperature is raised to between about 45 and 60 °C, and then gaseous bromine is added The reaction time is usually no more than about 2 to 3 h, but can vary depending on conditions, for example the rate at which bromine is added to the reaction mixture and the reaction temperature<br>
The product of Formula 2 can be isolated by standard techniques known in the art, including, filtration, extraction, evaporation and crystallization Additionally, the pH of the reaction mixture can be adjusted prior to isolating compounds of Formula 2 by addition of a base to remove hydrobromic acid byproduct For example, addition of about 3 to 15 parts by weight of aqueous 6 M sodium hydroxide solution relative to the starting compound of Formula 4 is often sufficient to completely neutralize the hydrobromic acid in the reaction mixture As the compounds of Formula 2 are typically crystalline solids, they are generally most easily isolated by filtration, optionally followed by washing with water and an organic solvent, such as ethanol or methanol, and then drying<br>
In another aspect of the present invention compounds of the Formula 1 prepared by the method of Scheme 1 are useful as intermediates for preparing compounds of Formula 5 Compounds of Formula 5 are useful as insecticides, as described, for example in PCT Patent Publications WO 2003/015518 and WO 2006/055922<br>

A variety of routes are possible for the preparation of a compound of Formula 5 from a compound of Formula 1 As outlined in Scheme 6, one such method involves the coupling of a compound of Formula la (Formula 1 wherein R1 is OR4 and R4 is H) with a pyrazole-5-carboxylic acid of Formula 10, resulting in a cyanobenzoxazinone of Formula 11 Subsequent reaction of the cyanobenzoxazinone with an amine of Formula 9 provides a compound of Formula 5 Conditions for the first step involve sequential addition of methanesulfonyl chloride in the presence of a tertiary amine such as tnethylamme or pyridine to a pyrazole of Formula 10, followed by the addition of a compound of Formula la, followed by a second addition of tertiary amine and methanesulfonyl chloride The reaction can be run neat or in a variety of suitable solvents including tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether, dioxane, toluene, dichloromethane or chloroform with optimum temperatures ranging from room temperature to the reflux temperature of the solvent The second step, reaction of benzoxazinones with amines to produce anthranilamides, is well documented in the chemical literature For a general review of benzoxazinone chemistry see Jakobsen et al, Biorganic and Medicinal Chemistry 2000, 8, 2095-2103 and references cited within, and G M Coppola, J Heterocyclic Chemistry 1999, 36, 563-588 Also see PCT Patent Publication WO 2004/067528, which teaches the general method shown in Scheme 6, including Wexperimental examples relevant to Scheme 6 <br>
 Scheme                  (Scheme Removed) <br>
Another method of preparing compounds of Formula 5 is shown in Scheme 7 In this method a compound of Formula 5 is prepared by combining a compound of Formula lb (Formula 1 wherein R1 is NHR3), a pyrazole of Formula 10 and sulfonyl chloride according to the general method taught in PCT Patent Publication WO 2006/062978, which is hereby incorporated herein in its entirety by reference<br>
Scheme 7<br>
(Scheme Removed) <br>
As described in WO 2006/062978 a variety of reaction conditions are possible for this method   Typically a sulfonyl chloride is added to a mixture of the compounds of Formulae<br>
lb and 10 in the presence of a solvent and a base Sulfonyl chlorides are generally of the formula RS(0)2C1 wherein R is a carbon-based radical Typically for this method R is C1-C4 alkyl, C1-C2 haloalkyl, or phenyl optionally substituted with 1-3 substituents independently selected from the group consisting of halogen, C1-C3 alkyl and nitro Commercially available sulfonyl chlorides include methanesulfonyl chloride (R is CH3), propanesulfonyl chloride (R is (CH2)2CH3), benzenesulfonyl chloride (R is phenyl), and p-toluenesulfonyl chloride (R is 4-methylphenyl) Methanesulfonyl chloride is of note for reasons of lower cost, ease of addition and/or less waste At least one molar equivalent of the sulfonyl chloride per mole of the compound of Formula 10 is stoichiometncally needed for complete conversion Typically the mole ratio of sulfonyl chloride to the compound of Formula 10 is no more than about 2 5, more typically no more than about 1 4<br>
Compound of Formula 5 is formed when the starting compounds of Formulae lb, 10 and the sulfonyl chloride are contacted with each other in a combined liquid phase, in which each is at least partially soluble Particularly as the starting materials of Formulae lb and 10 are typically solids at ordinary ambient temperatures, the method is most satisfactorily conducted using a solvent in which the starting compounds have significant solubility Thus typically the method is conducted in a liquid phase comprising a solvent In some cases the carboxylic acid of Formula 10 may have only slight solubility but its salt with added base may have more solubility in the solvent Suitable solvents for this method include nitnles such as acetonitnle and propionitnle, esters such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, and butyl acetate, ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), and methyl butyl ketone, haloalkanes such as dichloromethane and tnchloromethane, ethers such as ethyl ether, methyl rm-butyl ether, tetrahydrofuran (THF), and p-dioxane, aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, chlorobenzene, and dichlorobenzene, tertiary amines such as tnalkylamines, dialkylanihnes, and optionally substituted pyridines, and mixtures of the foregoing Solvents of note include acetonitnle, propionitnle, ethyl acetate acetone, MEK, dichloromethane, methyl tert-butyl ether, THF, p-dioxane, toluene, and chlorobenzene Of particular note as the solvent is acetonitnle, as it often provides products in superior yield and/or punty<br>
As the reaction of the present method generates hydrogen chlonde as a byproduct, which would otherwise bind to basic centers on the compounds of Formulae lb, 5 and 10, the method is most satisfactorily conducted in the presence of at least one added base The base can also facilitate constructive interaction of the carboxylic acid with the sulfonyl chlonde compound and the anthramlamide Reaction of an added base with the carboxylic acid of Formula 10 forms a salt, which may have greater solubility than the carboxylic acid in the reaction medium Although the base may be added at the same time, in alternation, or even after the addition of the sulfonyl chlonde the base is typically added before the addition of the sulfonyl chlonde   Some solvents such as tertiary amines also serve as bases,<br>
and when these are used as solvents they will be in large stoichiometric excess as bases When the base is not used as the solvent the nominal mole ratio of the base to the sulfonyl chloride is typically from about 2 0 to 2 2, and is preferably from about 2 1 to 2 2 Preferred bases are tertiary amines, including substituted pyridines More preferred bases include 2-picohne, 3-picohne, 2,6-lutidine, and pyridine Of particular note as the base is 3-picohne, as its salts with carboxylic acids of Formula 10 are often highly soluble m solvents such as acetonitnle<br>
A variety of methods known to those skilled in the art can be used to isolate compounds of Formula 5, including crystallization, filtration and extraction As disclosed in WO 2006/062978, in some cases under the coupling reaction conditions of Scheme 7 the compounds of Formula 5, can partial cyclize to form lmmobenzoxazine derivatives of Formula 12, as shown below in Scheme 8<br>
Scheme 8<br>
(Scheme Removed) <br>
As discussed in WO 2006/062978, in these cases it is often advantageous to convert the lmmobenzoxazine compounds of Formula 12 back to the amides of Formula 5 prior to isolation This conversion can be accomplished by treatment of the reaction mixture with an aqueous acid solution (e g, aqueous hydrochloric acid), or by isolating the mixture of Formula 12 and Formula 5 compounds, and then treating the mixture with an aqueous acid solution, optionally in the presence of a suitable organic solvent (e g , acetonitnle) WO 2006/062978 discloses specific examples relevant to the method of Scheme 7, including examples illustrating treatment of the reaction mixture with an aqueous acid solution prior to isolating compounds of Formula 5 Example 6 below also illustrates the method of Scheme 7 including treatment of the reaction mixture with water and hydrochloric acid prior to isolating the Formula 5 product<br>
Alternatively, compounds of Formula 12 can be converted back to compounds of Formula 5 pnor to isolation by contacting the reaction mixture with water and heating Typically   the conversion of Formula 12 compounds to Formula 5 compounds can be achieved by adding between about 2 to 6 parts by weight of water relative to the weight of the starting compound of Formula 1 and then heating to between about 45 and 65 °C   The<br>
conversion of the compound of Formula 12 to the compound of Formula 5 is usually complete in 1 h or less Reference Example 1 below illustrates the method of Scheme 7 including the treatment of the reaction mixture with water and heating prior to isolating the compound of Formula 5<br>
Pyrazole-5-carboxylic acids of Formula 10 can be prepared from 5-oxo-3-pyrazohdinecarboxylates by treatment with a halogenatmg reagent to give 3-halo-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-5-carboxylates, which can subsequently be treated with an oxidizing agent to provide esters of the acids of Formula 10 The esters can then be converted to the acids (I e Formula 10) Halogenatmg agents that can be used include, for example, phosphorous oxyhalides, phosphorous tnhalides, phosphorous pentahahdes, thionyl chloride, dihalotnalkylphosphoranes, dihalodiphenylphosphoranes, oxalyl chloride and phosgene The oxidizing agents can be, for example, hydrogen peroxide, organic peroxides, potassium persulfate, sodium persulfate, ammonium persulfate, potassium monopersulfate (e g, Oxone®) or potassium permanganate See PCT Publications WO 2003/016283, WO 2004/087689 and WO 2004/011453 for a description of the halogenation and oxidation methods, and a procedure for preparing the starting 5-oxo-3-pyrazohdinecarboxylates To convert the esters to carboxylic acids a variety of methods reported in the chemical literature can be used, including nucleophilic cleavage under anhydrous conditions or hydrolysis involving the use of either acids or bases (see T W Greene and PGM Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2nd ed , John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc , New York, 1991, pp 224-269 for a review of methods) Base-catalyzed hydrolytic methods are preferred to prepare the carboxylic acids of Formula 10 from the corresponding esters Suitable bases include alkali metal (such as lithium, sodium, or potassium) hydroxides For example, the esters can be dissolved in a mixture of water and alcohol such as methanol Upon treatment with sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, the ester saponifies to provide the sodium or potassium salt of the carboxylic acid Acidification with a strong acid such as hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid, gives the carboxylic acid PCT Publication WO 2003/016283 provides a relevant experimental example illustrating the base-catalyzed hydrolysis method for the conversion of an ester to an acid<br>
Alternatively, pyrazole-5-carboxyhc acids of Formula 10 can be prepared from 4,5-di-hydro-5-hydroxy-1H-pyrazole-5-carboxylates via an acid-catalyzed dehydration reaction to give esters, which can then be converted to the acids of Formula 10 Typical reaction conditions involve treatment of 4,5-dihydro-5-hydroxy-1H-pyrazole-5-carboxylates with an acid, for example, sulfuric acid, in an organic solvent, such as acetic acid, at temperatures between 0 and 100 °C The method is described PCT Publication WO 2003/016282 Conversion of the esters to acids can be done using the methods described above Also, WO 2003/016282 provides a relevant experimental example for the conversion of an ester to an acid<br>
Anthranihc amides of Formula lb can also be prepared from the anthramhc acid or ester derivatives of Formula lc (Formula 1 wherein Rl is OR4 and R4 is H or Cj-C4 alkyl) as shown below in Scheme 9 Forming amides from carboxylic acids typically involves addition of a coupling agent (e g, silicon tetrachloride, or alternatively dicyclohexylcarbodnmide or l-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylarmnopropyl)carbodiimide often in the presence of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole) Preparation of anthranihc amides from anthranihc acids is disclosed in M J Komet, Journal of Heterocyclic Chemistry 1992, 29(1), 103-5, PCT Publication WO 2001/66519-A2, T Asano et al, Bioorganic &amp; Medicinal Chemistry Letters 2004, 14(9), 2299-2302, H L Birch et al, Bioorganic

The methods of Schemes 6 and 7 are illustrative of just two of many methods for converting a compound of Formula 1 to the carboxarrude compound of Formula 5 A wide variety of general methods known in the art for preparing carboxamides from carboxylic acids and amines For a general review, see M North, Contemporary Org Synth 1995, 2, 269-287 Particular methods include contacting a compound of Formula lb with a compound of Formula 10 in the presence of a dehydrating coupling agent such as l,r-carbonyldnmidazole, bis(2-oxo-3-oxazolidinyl)phosphimc chloride or benzotnazol-1-yloxytns(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate, or a polymer-bound analogous reagent such as polymer-bound dicyclohexylcarbodnmide, typically m an inert solvent such as dichloromethane or N,N-dimethylformamide, as is generally disclosed in PCT Patent Publication WO 2003/15518 Also disclosed in WO 2003/15518 is a method of preparing an acyl chloride counterpart of the compound of Formula 10, such as by contact with thionyl<br>
chloride or oxalyl chloride in the presence of a catalytic amount of N,N-dimethylformamide and then contacting the derived acyl chloride with the compound of Formula lb in the presence of an acid scavenger, such as an amine base (e g, tnethylamine, N,N-diisopropylethylarrune, pyridine, and polymer-supported analogs) or a hydroxide or carbonate (eg, NaOH, KOH, Na2CO3, K2CO3), typically in an inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, 1,4-dioxane, ethyl ether or dichloromethane The product compounds of Formula 5 can be isolated from the reaction mixtures by methods known to those skilled in the art, including crystallization, filtration, and extraction<br>
