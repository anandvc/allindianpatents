				<td>COMPOSITION AND METHOD FOR CONTROLLING BIOLOGICAL<br>
GROWTH USING STABILIZED SODIUM HYPOBROMITE IN<br>
SYNERGISTIC COMBINATIONS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to biocides and,<br>
more particularly, to a composition and method for<br>
controlling biological growth using stabilized sodium<br>
hypobromite in synergistic combinations.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The proliferation of microorganisms and the<br>
resultant formation of slime is a problem which commonly<br>
occurs in aqueous systems. Problematic slime producing<br>
microbes may include bacteria, fungi and algae. Slime<br>
deposits typically occur in many industrial aqueous<br>
systems including cooling water systems, pulp and paper<br>
mill systems, petroleum operations, clay and pigment<br>
slurries, recreational water systems, air washer systems,<br>
decorative fountains, food, beverage, and industrial<br>
process pasteurizers, sweetwater systems, gas scrubber<br>
systems, latex systems, industrial lubricants, cutting<br>
fluids, etc.<br>
The proliferation of organisms such as mussels and<br>
clams is also a problem which occurs in many water<br>
systems. Growth of these organisms is a serious problem<br>
in municipal and industrial water systems such as once-<br>
through or recirculating cooling water systems, cooling<br>
ponds, intake pipes, ballast water tanks and ship<br>
reservoirs that draw water from infested bodies of water.<br>
Biocides and antimicrobials are used to control<br>
microbial growth in a number of different aqueous media.<br>
As used herein, "control" is defined to-include both<br>
inhibition and removal. If left untreated, microbes and<br>
microbial biofilms (slimes) can cause deterioration of<br>
cooling tower structures, loss in heat exchange<br>
efficiency in a cooling system, aesthetic defects in<br>
decorative fountains, promotion and acceleration of<br>
corrosion on metal surfaces, increased down time, or<br>
breaks in paper sheets in pulp and paper systems.<br>
Bacterial slimes may also be objectionable as they relate<br>
to cleanliness and sanitation in breweries, dairies, and<br>
other industrial food and beverage process water systems.<br>
The proliferation of microbial contamination in<br>
lubricants and cutting fluids is a common problem due to<br>
the elevated temperatures and unsanitary conditions found<br>
in many metal working plants.<br>
For many types of municipal and industrial water<br>
systems, screening of intake water is often performed to<br>
prevent the entrance of large objects, including mature<br>
clams and mussels. This screening, however, does not<br>
prevent the passage of jivenile macroinvertebrates.<br>
These early life stages of the macroinvertebrates attach<br>
within water systems and mature to a size and density<br>
which cause fouling. This growth can cause severe<br>
plugging and damage to the systems they colonize,<br>
resulting in system down time and costly cleanings and<br>
repairs. As a consequence of the deleterious effects of<br>
uncontrolled biological growth and contamination in many<br>
industrial processes, different biocides and<br>
antimicrobials have been developed to aid in eliminating<br>
and controlling biological growth.<br>
Often, one biocide is insufficient to control<br>
biological growth in the aqueous media. Biocides may act<br>
in combination, i.e. synergistically, to yield better<br>
biocidal performance as opposed to the efficacy obtained<br>
when each biocide is used separately. Biocides may act<br>
on the target organism in a number of different ways to<br>
cause cell stress or death. The mechanisms by which<br>
biocides exert biocidal activity depend upon a number of<br>
factors which include the chemical properties of the<br>
biocide, and the biochemical and physical characteristics<br>
of the target organism. Some biocides target the cell<br>
membrane or cell wall. Others target critical enzymes or<br>
the cellular metabolic machinery which leads to cell<br>
death or disruption of cellular replication.<br>
The combination of two biocides may yield enhanced<br>
efficacy beyond the cumulative or additive effect of the<br>
two biocides. This likely reflects a synergistic<br>
biocidal effect on some essential component(s) of the<br>
cell for survival and sustained growth. A combination of<br>
two biocides that are synergistic allows for the addition<br>
of lesser amounts of the individual biocides to achieve<br>
the desired level of control. This has both advantageous<br>
environmental and economic impacts. It allows for<br>
reduced discharge of potential environmental pollutants<br>
and a more cost effective control program for diverse<br>
industrial systems.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide<br>
novel biocidal compositions which provide enhanced<br>
effectiveness for controlling the growth of both<br>
microorganisms and macroorganisms in industrial fluids.<br>
It is another object of this invention to provide an<br>
improved method for controlling microorganisms and<br>
macroorganisms in industrial fluids. It is an advantage<br>
of the present invention that the biocidal compositions<br>
permit a reduction in the amount of biocide required to<br>
achieve acceptable biological control.<br>
Important applications of the synergistic biocidal<br>
compositions of the present invention include, but are<br>
not limited to, controlling the growth of microorganisms<br>
such as bacteria, fungi and algae, and macroorganisms<br>
such as zebra mussels, blue mussels and the Asiatic clam<br>
in aqueous media. The composition of the present<br>
invention possesses unexpected synergistic activity<br>
against microorganisms and macroorganisms.<br>
Stabilized sodium hypobromite is less volatile and<br>
more stable than other halogenated molecules such as<br>
sodium hypochiorite and sodium hypobromite. Also, much<br>
higher levels of available halogen for microbial<br>
disinfection are attained using stabilized sodium<br>
hypobromite than with other halogenated antimicrobials.<br>
Further, stabilized sodium hypobromite yielded reduced<br>
generation of adsorbable organic halogen (AOX) in<br>
laboratory studies and process waters.<br>
This invention provides superior biological control<br>
by combining stabilized sodium hypobromite with at least<br>
one compound selected from the group consisting of coco<br>
alkyldimethylamine oxide, n-coco<br>
alkyltrimethylenediamine, tetra-alkyl phosphonium<br>
chloride, 7-oxabicyclo [2.2.1] heptane-2 , 3-dicarboxylic<br>
acid and 4, 5-dichloro-2-n-octyl-4-isothiazoline-3-one .<br>
The combination of the two biocides leads to unexpectedly<br>
superior results, and allows for significantly less use<br>
of either biocide compared to the necessary amount of<br>
each individual biocide to achieve the same biocidal<br>
performance. In addition to biocidal synergism, the use<br>
of these biocide combinations may result in improved<br>
removal of adherent biomass due to the biocidal<br>
persistence of coco alkyldimethylamine oxide, n-coco<br>
alkyltrimethylenediamine, tetra-alkyl phosphonium<br>
chloride, 7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2,3-dicarboxylic<br>
acid and 4, 5-dichloro-2-n-octyl-4-isothiazoline-3-one<br>
coupled with the reactivity and biofilm removal<br>
properties of- stabilized sodium hypobromite. As is well<br>
known in the art, stabilized sodium hypobromite, coco<br>
alkyldimethylamine oxide, n-coco<br>
alkyltrimethylenediamine, tetra-alkyl phosphonium<br>
chloride, 7-oxabicyclo [2.2.1]heptane-2, 3-dicarboxylic<br>
acid and 4,5-dichloro-2-n-octyl-4-isothiazoline-3-one<br>
exhibit biocidal activity when used alone. However, the<br>
prior art does not teach or suggest the performance<br>
advantages of the inventive combinations or the resulting<br>
synergistic behavior.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The composition of the present invention comprises<br>
stabilized sodium hypobromite and at least one compound<br>
selected from the group consisting of coco<br>
alkyldimethylamine oxide, n-coco<br>
alkyltrimethylenediamine, tetra-alkyl phosphonium<br>
chloride, 7-oxabicyclo [2.2.1] heptane-2, 3-dicarboxylic<br>
acid and 4 , 5-dichloro-2-n-octyl-4-isothiazoline-3-one.<br>
The inventive composition effectively controls<br>
biological growth in industrial fluids.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to a composition<br>
and method for controlling biological growth in<br>
industrial fluids using stabilized sodium hypobromite in<br>
synergistic combinations. In accordance with this<br>
invention, stabilized sodium hypobromite is added to the<br>
industrial fluid in combination with another compound.<br>
Suitable compounds which may be used in combination with<br>
the stabilized sodium hypobromite include, but are not<br>
limited to, surfactants such as coco alkyldimethylamine<br>
oxide and n-coco alkyltrimethylenediamine, and non-<br>
oxidizing biocides such as tetra-alkyl phosphonium<br>
chloride, 7-oxabicyclo [2.2.1] heptane-2, 3-dicarboxylic<br>
acid (also known as endothall) and 4,5-dichloro-2-n-<br>
octyi-4-isothiazolin-3-one.<br>
The biological growth may be microbiological or<br>
macrobiological in nature. Microbiological growth<br>
includes bacteria, fungi, algae and combinations thereof.<br>
Macrobiological growth includes zebra mussels (Dreissena<br>
polymorpha, Dreissena bugensis), blue mussels (Mytilus<br>
edulis) , and the Asiatic clam (Corbicula fluminea) .<br>
The stabilized sodium hypobromite may be sodium<br>
hypobromite stabilized with sodium sulfamate. The sodium<br>
hypobromite may be stabilized with an alkali metal<br>
sulfamate, such as sodium sulfamate. Moreover, the<br>
sodium hypobromite may also be stabilized with an acid<br>
amide derivative selected from the group consisting of<br>
carbonic acids, hydrogen cyanide, carboxylic acids, amino<br>
acids, sulfuric acids, phosphoric acids and boric acids.<br>
The industrial fluids include cooling waters; food,<br>
beverage and industrial process waters; pulp and paper<br>
mill systems; brewery pasteurizers; sweetwater systems;<br>
air washer systems; oil field drilling fluids and muds;<br>
petroleum recovery processes; industrial lubricants;<br>
cutting fluids; heat transfer systems; gas scrubber<br>
systems; latex systems; clay and pigment systems;<br>
decorative fountains; water intake pipes; ballast water<br>
tanks and ship reservoirs, among others.<br>
The amount of stabilized sodium hypobromite may<br>
range from about 0.05 ppm to about 1000 ppm total<br>
residual oxidant (as chlorine) and the amount of the<br>
compound selected from the group consisting of coco<br>
alkyldimethylamine oxide, n-coco<br>
alkyltrimethylenediamine, tetra-alkyl phosphonium<br>
chloride, 7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2,3-dicarboxylic<br>
acid and 4,5-dichloro-2-n-octyl-4-isothiazoline-3-one<br>
ranges from about 0.05 ppm to about 1000 ppm active<br>
ingredient (active ingredient refers to the amount of the<br>
compound in the industrial fluid)-. "Total residual<br>
oxidant" as used herein is defined as hypobromite or<br>
hypobromous acid, expressed as chlorine, including<br>
chemical combinations of those two compounds with ammonia<br>
or organic nitrogen-containing compounds.<br>
As used herein, the term "stabilized sodium<br>
hypobromite" indicates NaOBr stabilized with sodium<br>
sulfamate. However, NaOBr can be stabilized with other<br>
stabilizers which includes the acid amide derivatives of<br>
carbonic acids, hydrogen cyanide, carboxylic acids, amino<br>
acids, sulfuric acids, phosphoric acids and boric acids.<br>
Moreover, stabilizers can be selected from the group of<br>
compounds having an N-H or NH2 group adjacent to an<br>
electron withdrawing functional group such as C=O, S=O,<br>
P=O, or B=O.<br>
Stabilization of NaOBr is desirable to prevent<br>
disproportionation into halates and halides upon storage.<br>
As a result of stabilization, these biocides can be<br>
stored more safely since less bromate is generated, fewer<br>
organic molecules containing halogens are formed, and<br>
volatility is reduced. A stabilized aqueous alkali or<br>
alkaline earth metal hypobromite solution may be prepared<br>
in the following fashion:<br>
a. Mixing an aqueous solution of alkali or alkaline<br>
earth metal hypochlorite having from about 5 percent to<br>
about 70 percent available halogen as chlorine with a<br>
water soluble bromide ion source;<br>
b. Allowing the bromide ion source and the alkali<br>
or alkaline earth metal hypochlorite to react to form a<br>
0.5 to 70 percent by weight aqueous solution of<br>
unstabilized alkali or alkaline earth metal hypobromite;<br>
c. Adding to the unstabilized solution of alkali or<br>
alkaline earth metal hypobromite an aqueous solution of<br>
an alkali metal sulfamate in a quantity to provide a<br>
molar ratio of alkali metal sulfamate to alkali or<br>
alkaline earth metal hypobromite from about 0.5 to about<br>
7; and<br>
d. Recovering a stabilized aqueous alkali or<br>
alkaline earth metal hypobromite solution.<br>
The stabilized sodium hypobromite utilized herein<br>
(STABREX®) is available from Nalco Chemical Company of<br>
Naperville, IL.<br>
The synergistic composition of this invention may be<br>
added separately to an industrial fluid or may be<br>
formulated as a simple mixture comprising its essential<br>
ingredients.<br>
It may be the case that the stabilized sodium<br>
hypobromite will act synergistically against<br>
microorganisms when combined with other non-oxidizing<br>
biocides or surfactants. It is expected that the above<br>
detailed description would also apply to a composition<br>
and method for controlling macrobiological growth in<br>
industrial fluids comprising a combination of stabilized<br>
sodium hypobromite with other non-oxidizing biocides.<br>
Examples of other non-oxidizing biocides include<br>
glutaraldehyde, 2,2-dibromo-3-nitrilopropionamide<br>
(DBNPA), 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-l,3 diol, 1-bromo-l-<br>
(bromomethyl)-1,3-propanedicarbonitrile,<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
The following examples are intended to be<br>
illustrative of the present invention and to teach one of<br>
ordinary skill how to make and use the invention. These<br>
examples are not intended to limit the invention or its<br>
protection in any way.<br>
Synergism was determined in each of the Examples<br>
below by an industrially accepted method as described by<br>
Kull, F.C., Eisman, P.C., Sylwestrowicz, H.D. and Mayer,<br>
R.L. in Applied Microbiology, 9:538-541 (1961), using the<br>
equation for the calculation of a synergy index<br>
determined by:<br>
Qa/QA + Qb/QB = Synergy Index (S.I.)<br>
wherein<br>
QA = concentration of compound A in parts per million<br>
(ppm) acting alone, which produced an endpoint;<br>
Qa = concentration of compound A in ppm, in the<br>
mixture, which produced an endpoint;<br>
Qs = concentration of compound B in ppm acting alone<br>
which produced an endpoint;<br>
Qb = concentration of compound B in ppm, in the<br>
mixture, which produced an<br>
endpoint.<br>
When the sum of Qa/QA and Qb/QB is greater than 1.0,<br>
antagonism is indicated. When the sum is equal to 1.0,<br>
additivity is indicated, and when the sum is less than<br>
1.0, synergy is demonstrated.<br>
Example 1<br>
Chloralla sorokiniana green algae were grown in<br>
Proteose medium for three weeks, harvested by<br>
centrifugation, and resuspended in synthetic cooling<br>
water (pH 8.2). For the assay, 96-well tissue culture<br>
microplate (FALCON® 3075) wells were prepared with 200 uL<br>
of the indicated biocides in synthetic cooling water.<br>
100 uL of a Chlorella sorokiniana cell suspension [10"<br>
Colony Forming Units (CFU) per mL] were inoculated into<br>
each microplate well providing a 300 uL total volume.<br>
Microplates were covered with the provided lid and<br>
incubated at 25°C for six days with 16 hour/8 hour<br>
light/dark cycles (cool-white fluorescent lamps, 1255<br>
lux) . Following incubation, the supernatant from each<br>
microplate well was removed by aspiration and chlorophyll<br>
was extracted from the remaining cells using<br>
dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) . The reduction in algae cell<br>
chlorophyll content due to algicidal activity was<br>
measured using the optical density at 650 ran (Beckman<br>
Biomek® plate reader) of each extraction. As shown below<br>
in Table 1, synergy was indicated.<br>
Example 2<br>
The test protocol described above in Example 1 was<br>
utilized. However, for this example, the test inoculum<br>
was 100 pL of Scenedesmus obliquus green algae (106<br>
CFU/mL). As shown below in Table 2, synergy was<br>
indicated.<br>
harvested by centrifugation, and resuspended in synthetic<br>
cooling water (pH 8.2). For the assay, 12-well tissue<br>
culture microplate (FALCON®) wells were prepared with 4 mL<br>
algae suspension (OD664nm, = 0.15) and dosed with the<br>
indicated biocide. Plates were incubated at 25°C for 24<br>
hours with continuous illumination. Following<br>
incubation, a 1 mL sample from each microplate well was<br>
removed and chlorophyll in each sample was measured using<br>
extraction with 90% acetone and a standard trichromatic<br>
spectrophotometric procedure [Standard Methods for the<br>
Examination of Water and Wastewater, 19th edition (1995)].<br>
The results are shown below in Table 3 and are reported<br>
as percent reduction in chlorophyll relative to an<br>
untreated control culture. Synergy was indicated.<br>

connection with preferred or illustrative embodiments,<br>
these embodiments are not intended to be exhaustive or<br>
limiting of the invention. Rather, the invention is<br>
