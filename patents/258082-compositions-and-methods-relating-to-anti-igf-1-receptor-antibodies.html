Unless otherwise defined herein, scientific and tecbirlcal terms used in connection with the present invention shall have the meanings that are commonly uiiderstood by those of ordinary skill in the art Further, unless otherwise required by context singulai terms shall include pluralities and plural terms shall include the Singular. Generally. nomenclatures used in connection with, and techniques o£ cell and tissue culrure, molecular biology. immunology, microbiology, genetics and protein and micleic acid chemistry and hybridizarion described herein are those well known and commonly used in the art The rnethods and techniques of the present invention are generally perfonned accordmg to conventional methods well known in the art and as described in various general and more specific references that are cited and discossed throughout the present specincation unless otherwise indicated. See. e.g.. Sambrook et al. Molecular aoning: A Laboratory Manual, 2d ed.. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. Cold Spring Harbor. N.Y. (1989) and Ausubel et al» Currem Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates (1992), and Harlow and Lane Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual Cold Spring Harbor laboratory Press. Cold Spring Harbor. N.Y. (1990). which are incorporated herein by reference. Enzymaric reactions and purification techniques are performed according to manufacturer's specüäcations, as commonly accomplished in the art or as described herein. The terminology used in connection with, and the laboratory procednres and techniques of analytical chemistry, synthetic organic chemistry, and medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry described herein are those well known and commonly used in the art Standard techniques can be used for chenrical syntheses, chemica] analyses. phanriaceutical preparaticox, forrnulation, and delivery, and treatment of patients.<br>
The following terms, unless otherwise indicated, shall be undexstood to have the following meanings:<br>
The term "isolated molecule" (where the molecule is, for example, a Polypeptide, a polynucleotide. or an antibody) is a molecule thatby virtue of its origin or source of derivation (1) is not associated with naturally associated components that accompany it in its native State, (2) is substantially free of other molecules from the same species (3) is expressed by a cell from a different species. or (4) does not occur in nature. Thus; a molecule that is chemically synthesizecl or synthesized in a cellular System different from the cell from which it naturally originales, will be "isolated" from its naturally associated components. A molecule also may be rendered substantially free of naturally associated components by isolation, using purification techniques well known in the art Molecule purity or homogeneity may be assayed by a nurober of means well known in the art. For example, tbe purity ofa Polypeptide sample maybe assayed using Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and staining of the gel to visualize the polypepüde using techniques well known in the art For certain purposes. higher resolution may be provided by using HPLC or other means well known in the art for purification.<br>
The terms "IGF-1R inhibitor" and trTGF-lR antagonisf' are used rnterchangeably. Each is a molecule that detectably inhibits at least one function of IGF-1R. Conversely, an "IGF-IR agonist" is a molecule that detectably increases at least one function of IGF-IR. The Inhibition caused by an IGF-1R inhibitor need not be complete so long as it is detectable using an assay. Any assay of a function of IGF-1R can be used, examples of which are provided herein. Examples of functions of IGF-1R that can be inhibited by an IGF-1R inhibitor, or increased by an IGF-1R agonist inchzde binding to IGF-1. IGF-12. and/or another IGF-lR-activating molecule. kmase activity, downstream signaüng, and so on. Focamples of types<br><br>
f IGF-1R inhibitors and IGF-1R agonists include, but are not limited to, IGF-1R binding Polypeptides such ; antigen binding proteins (e.g., IGF-1R iahibiting antiben binding proteins), antibodies, antibody Zements, s"nd antibody derivatives.<br>
The terms "peptide," tlpohpepride" and "protein" eaeh refers to a molecule comprising two or sore amino acid residues joined to each other by peptide bonds. These terms encornpass, e.g., native and nröcial proteins. protein fxagments and porypepti.de analogs (such as ranteins. varianis, and fusion Toffisos) of a protein seqnence as well as post-translationaily, or omerwise covalentiy or non-covalently, oodifiec nmtmncL  A peptide, Polypeptide, or protein may be monomeric or polymeric.<br>
The tercn "polypeptide firagment1' as used herein refers to a Polypeptide that has an ammo-tenrrmal md/oer carboxy-terrrjinal deletioB as compared to a correspontüns full-length protein. Fragments can be, for ;xairok,atl£ast5, 6,7, 8,9,10, 11,12,13, 14,15,20,50,70,80,90, 100, 150 or200 amino acids in £2gÜL Fragmems can also be, for example, at most 1,000, 750, 500, 250, 200, 175, 150,125, 100, 90, 80: 70, 60, 50, 40. 30, 20, 15, 14. 13, 12, 11, or 10 amino acids in iength. A fragment canttrröier comprise, at eirher ox both of rs ends, one or rnore additional amino acids, for example, a sequence of amino acids from a öifferent naüirally-occurring protein (e.g.y an Fe or leucine zipper domain) or an artificial amino acid seqaence (e.g., an artificial linker sequence).<br>
Polypeptides of the ürvention include Polypeptides that have been modiüed in any way and for any reason, for example, to: (1) reduce suseeptibility to proteolysis, (2) reduce suseeptibility to Oxidation, (3) alter binding affinity for forming protein complexes, (4) alter binding af5niti.es, and (4) confer or modify other physicochemical or functional properties. Analogs include muteins of a Polypeptide. For example. Single or multiple armno acid substitutions (e.g., conservative amino acid substitutions) may be made in the naturally oecurring sequence (e.g.. in the portion of the polypeptide outside the domain(s) forrning mtermolecular contacts. A "conservative amino acid Substitution" is one that does not substantially change the structural characteristics of the parent sequence (e.g., a replacement amino acid should not tend to break a hehx that oecurs in the parent sequence, or disrupt other types of secondary strueture that characterize the parent sequence or are necessary for its functionality). Examples of art-recognized polypeptide secondary and tertiär)^ struetures are described in Proteins, Structures and Molecular Prrnciples (Creighton, Ed., W. H. Freeman and Company, New York (1984)); Introduction to Protein Strueture (C. Branden and J. Tooze. eds.5 Gariand Publishing, New York, N.Y. (1991)): and Thomton et at. Nature 354:105 (1991), which are eacb incorporated herein by Teference.<br>
The present invenüon also provides non-peptide analogs of IGF-1R binding Polypeptides. Non-peptide analogs are commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry as drugs with properties analogous to those of the template peptide. These types of non-peptide Compound are termed "peptide rnimetics1' or "peptidomimetics". Fauchere, J. Adv. Drug Res. 15:29 (1986); Veber and Freidinger UNS p.392 (1985); and Evans et dl. J. Med.

An "antigen binding protein" is a protein comprising a portion diat binds to an antigen and, optionally, a scaffold or framework portion that allows die antigen binding portion to adopt a conformadon that promotes binding of the antigen binding protein to die antigen. Examples of antigen binding proteins include antibodies, antibody fragments (e.g.. an antigen binding portion of an antibody), antibody derivatives, and antibody analogs. The antigen binding protein can comprise, for example, an alternative protein scaffold or artificial scaffold wirb grafted CDRs or CDR derivatives. Such scaffoids include, but are not limited to. antibody-öerived scaffolds comprising mntations introduced to. for example, stabilize tbe tineendirnensional structure of übe antigen binding protein as well as wholly synthetic scaffolds comprising, for example. a biocompatible poryiner. See. for example. Korndorfer et al.s 2003, Proteins: Structure, Function, and Bioinfonnarics. Votene 53. Issue 1:121-129: Roque et al.. 2004. Biotechnol. Prog. 20:639-654. In addition, peptide antibody rnimetics ("PAMs") can be used. as well as scaffoids based on antibody rnimetics utiliring flbronection corziponents as a scaffold.<br>
An antigen binding protein can have. for example. the structure of a naturally occurring immunoglobulin. An "mimunogiobniin"' is a tetrameric molecule. In a naturally occurring Immunoglobulin, each tetramer is composed of two identical pairs of Polypeptide chains. each pair having one ,Tlight" (about 25 kDa) and one "heavy1' chain (about 50-70 kDa). The amino-terminal portion of each chain includes a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more arrrino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The carboxy-tepm'nal portion of each chain defines a constant region primarily responsible for effector function. Human ligbt chains are classified as kappa and lambda light chains. Heavy chains are classified as mu, delta, gamma, alpha, or epsilon, and define the antibody1 s isotype as IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA, and IgE, respecdvely. Within light and heavy chains. übe variable and constant regions are joined by a "J" region of about 12 or more amino acids, with the heavy chain also including a MD" region of about 10 more amino acids. See generally, Fundamental Immunology Ch. 7 (PauL W.. ed., 2nd ed. Raven Press, N.Y.<br><br>
(1989)) (incoiporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes). The variable regions ofeach light/beavy chain pair form the antibody binding site such that an iniact iinrnnnoglobiilin has two binding sites.<br>
Naturally occurring inirnimoglobulin chains exhibit the same general structirre of relatively conserved. framework regions (FR) joined by three hypervaxiable regions. also called canpicziieiitaiüy detexmining regions or CDRs, From N-tcnrnpus to C-terminns, both light and heavy cheins comprise the domains FRL CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3 and FR4. The assigmnent of amino aciös so each domain is in accordance with the definitions of Kabat et al. in Sequences of Proteins qflmrmmologicad htteresL 5 Ed., US Dept of Health and Human Services, PHS, NIE NIH Pubbeation no. 91-3242, 1991.<br>
An "ariribodyn refers to an intact immunoglobolin or to an antigen binding ponxxi mereof -OBS. competes with the intact antibody for specific binding, unless ötherwise speeified. Antigen binrimg portions may be prodneed by recombinant DNA teckniques or by enzymatic or chankal c lesvage of imact arüibodies. Antigen binding portions include, tnter alia. Fab. Fab\ Ffab^ Fv, domain antibodies (dAbsl and complementarity determining region (CDR) fragmenrs. single-chain antibodies (scFv). chnneric antibodies, diabodies. triabodies, tetrabodies, and Polypeptides that contain at least a porrion of an irnrnunogiobulin that is suf&amp;cient to confer specific antigen binding to the Polypeptide.<br>
A Fab fragment is a monovalent fragment having the V^. VH. CL and QJ1 domains: a F(abT)-fragment is a bivalent fragment having two Fab fragments linked by a disulflde bridge ai the hinge region: a Fd fragment has the VH and CH1 domains; an Fv fragment has the VL and VH domains of a Single arm of an antibody; and a dAb fragment has a VH domain, a VL domain. or an antigen-binding fragment of a VH or VL domain (US Pat No. 6,846:634; 6:696;245, US App. Pub. No. 05/0202512, 04/0202995, 04/0038291, 04/0009507, 03/0039958, Ward etal, Nature 341:544-546, 1989).<br>
A single-chain antibody (scFv) is an antibody in which a VL and a VH region are joined via a linker (e.g., a synthetic sequence of amino aeid residues) to form a contmuous protein chain whexein the linker is long enough to allow the protein chain to fold back on itself and form a monovalent antigen binding site (see, e.g., Bird et dl.., 1988, Science 242:423-26 and Huston et al., 1988, Proc. NatL Acad Sei USA 85:5S79-83). Diabodies are bivalent antibodies comprising two Polypeptide chains, ^herein each Polypeptide chain comprises VH and VL domains joined by a linker that is too shon to a3ow for parring berween two domains on the same chain. fcns allowiag each domain to pair with £ cornplementary domain on another Polypeptide chain (see, e.g., Holliger a al„ 1993, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sei USA 90:6444-48, and Poljak et al., 1994, Structure 2:1121-23). If the two Polypeptide chains of a diabody are idenücal, then a diabody resulting from their pairing will have two identical antigen binding sites. Polypeptide chains having different sequences can be used to rnake a diabody with two different antigen binding sites. Similarly, tribodies and tetrabodies are antibodies cornprising three and four Polypeptide chains, respectively, and forrning three and fonr antigen binding sites. respectively, which can be the same or different.<br>
Complementarity determining regions (CDRs) and framework regions (FR) of a given antibody may be identified using the System described by Kabat ei al. in Sequences of Proteins of Irnmtraological Interest, 5th Ed., US Dept of Health and Hnman Services, PHS, NIH, NIH Publication no: 91-3242, 1991. One or more CDRs may be incorporated into a molecnle either covalently or noncovalentiy to make it an antigen binding protein. An antigen bindins protein may incorporate the CDR(s) as part of a larger<br><br>
Polypeptide chain, may covalently link the CDR(s) to another Polypeptide chain, or may incorporate the CDR(s) noncovalently. The CDRs penrdt rhe antigen binding protein to speciacaUy bind to a particular antigen of interest<br>
An antigen binding protein may bave one or more binding sites. If there is more than one binding site, the binding sites may be identical to one another or may be difFerent For example, a nanirally occurrmg HrcmaTi jnimunoglobulin typically has two identical binding sites, white a "bispecific" or '"bifunctional" antibody has two düferent binding sites.<br>
The tenn "human antibody" includes all antibodies that have one or more variable and constant regions derived from human iinnnmoglobtiim sequences. In one embodirnent all of the variable and consraHt domains are derived from human Immunoglobulin sequences (a fully human antibody). These antibodies may be prepared in a vaiiety of ways, examples of which are described below. inchiding through the immrrnizarion with an antigen of interest of a mouse that is geneticalry modified to express aiiribodies derived from human heavy and/or light chain-encoding genes.<br>
A humanized antibody has a sequence that diners frorn the sequence of an antibody derived from a non-human species by one or more amino acid substitutions. deletions. and/or additions, such that the humanized antibody is less likely to induce an immune response, and/or induces a less severe immune response, as compared to the non-human species antibody, when it is administered to a human subject. In one embodirnent certahi amino acids in the framework and constant domains of the heavy and/or light chains of the non-human species antibody are mutated to produce the humanized antibody. In another embodirnent, the constant domain(s) from a human antibody are fused to the variable domain(s) of a non-human species. In another embodirnent, one or more amino acid residues in one or more CDR sequences of a non-human antibody are changed to reduce the likely immunogenicity of the non-human antibody when it is administered to a human subject, wherein the changed amino acid residues either are not critical for imnnmospecific binding of the antibody to its antigen, or the changes to the amino acid sequence that are made are conservative changes. such that the binding of the humanized antibody to the antigen is not significantly worse than the binding of the non-human antibody to the antigen. Examples of how to make humanized antibodies may be found in U.S. PaL Nos. 6,054.297, 5.886.152 and 5,877,293.<br>
The tenn "chimeric antibody" refers to an antibody th3t contains one or more regions from one antibody and one or more regions from one or more other antibodies. In one embodirnent, one or more of the CDRs are derived from a human anti-IGF-lR antibody. In another embodirnent, all of the CDRs sie derived from a human antiTGF-lR antibody. In another embodirnent, the CDRs frommore than one human anti-IGF-lR antibodies are mixed and matched in a chimeric antfoody. For instance. a chimeric antibody may comprise a CDR1 from the light chain of a fest human anti-IGF-lR antibody, a CDR2 and a CDR3 from the light chain of a second human anfi-IGF-lR antibody, and the CDRs from the heavy chain from a third anti-IGF-lR antibody. Further, the framework regions may be derived from one of the same anti-IGF-lR antibodies, from one or more difrerent antibodies, such as a human antibody, or from a humanized antibody. In one example of a chimeric antibody, a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with, homologous to. or derived from an antibody from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody dass or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is/are identical with, homologous 1       to, or derived from an antibody (-ies) from another species or belonging to another antibody dass or<br><br>
subclass. Also included are fragments of such antibodies that cxhfoit the desired biological activity (i.e., tbe ability to specifically bind IGF-1R). See, e.g.t U.S. Patent No. 4.816,567 and Morrison, 1985, Science 229:1202-07.<br>
A "rieutralizing antibody" or "an inhibitory antibody" is an antibody that innfoits Ihs binding of IGF- 1R to IGF-I and/or IGF-2 when an excess of tbe anti-IGF-lR antibody reduces the amount of IGF-1 and'ox IGF-2 bound to IGF-1R by at least about 20% using tbe assay described in Exaiuple 9. In various enixK&amp;nenrs, die antibody reduces tbe amount of IGF-I and/or IGF-2 bound to IGF-1R by at least 30%., 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 75%, 80%: 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%: 99%, and 99.9%.<br>
An "actrvating antibody" is an antibody that activates IGF-1R by at least about 20% when added to a cell tissue or organism expressing IGF-1R. where "100% activation" is tbe level of activation achieved under physiological conditions by tbe same molar amount of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2. In various emboäunents, tbe antibody activates IGF-1R activity by at least 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%, 125%, 150%, 175%, 200%, 250%, 300%, 350%, 400%, 450%, 500%, 750%, or 1000%.<br>
Fragments or analogs of antibodies can be readily prepared by tbose of ordinary skill in tbe art following tbe teachings of this specificatiorj and using tecbniques well-known in tbe art. Prefexred amino-and caxboxy-tennini of fraginents or analogs occux near boundaries of functional domains. Stnicüiral and functional domains can be identified by comparison of tbe nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence data to public or proprietary sequence databases. Compirterized comparison methods can be used to ideirtify sequence motifs or predicted protein conformation domains tbat occur in otber proteirts of kncwn structure and/or function. Methods to identify' protein sequences tbat fold into a known three-dimensional structure are known. See, e.g., Bowie et al., 1991. Science 253:164.<br>
A "CDR grafted antibody" is au antibody cbmprising one or more CDRs derived from an antibody of a particular species or isotype and the fxamework of anotber antibod}' of the same or tiifferent species or isotype.<br>
A "multi-specific antibody" is an antibody that recognizes more than one epitope on one or more antigens. A subclass of this type of antibody is a "bi-specific antibody" which recognizes wo distinct epitopes on the same or different antigens.<br>
An antigen binding protein "specmcally binds" to an antigen {e.g.. human IGF-1R) if iibinds to the antigen with a dissociation constant of 1 nanomolar or less.<br>
An "antigen binding domain," "antigen binding region," or "antigen binding siten is a portion of an antigen binding protein that contains amino acid residues (or other moieties) that interact with an antigen and contribute to the antigen binding protein's speciScity and afSnity for the antigen. For an antibody that specifically binds to its antigen, this v&gt;iU include at least part of at least one of its GOR domains.<br>
An "epitope" is the portion of a molecule tbat is bound by an antigen binding protein (e.g., by an antibody). An epitope can comprise non-contiguous portions of the molecule (eg\, in a Polypeptide, amino acid residues that are not contiguous in the polypeptide's prrrnary sequence but that, in tbe context of tbe Polypeptide ;s tertiary and quaternary structure. are near enough to each other to be bound by an antigen binding protein).<br><br>
The ^percent identity" of two polynucleotide or two Polypeptide sequences is determined by c-nrnparing ihr sequences using ins GAP Computer program (a part of the GCG Wisconsin Package, Version 10.3 (Accetys. San Diego, CA)) using its default parameters.<br>

Two EHEie'SiiSDded polynadeotides are "the complerDent" of each otiier if their sequences can be ahgned in an ami-paiHÖe] orieifiianoc soch that every nucleotide in one polynucleotide is opposite its cornplemensry nuckoäde in the other polynucleotide, without the introduction of gaps, and without unpaired rrncleotiäes ai the 5' or rhe 3! end of either sequence. A polynucleotide is "a^rnplementary', to another porynncleotide if the two polynucleotides can hybridize to one another under moderately stringent conditions. Thns, 3 polynncleotide can be complementary to another polynucleotide without being its complement.<br>
A 'Vector"' is a nucleic acid that can be used to introduce another nucleic acid linked to it into a cell. One type of vector is a "plasmid," which refers to a linear or circular double stranded DNA molecule into which additional nucleic acid Segments canbe ligated. Another type of vector is a viral vector (e.g., replication defective retroviruses, adenovinises and adeno-associated viruses), wherein additional DNA Segments can be introdnced into the viral genome. Certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell imo which they are irrrroduced (e.g.s bacterial vectors comprising a bacterial origin of replication and episomal rnarnmalian vectors). Orher vectors (e.g., non-episomal mammalian vectors) are integrated into rhe gcnome of z host cell lipon introduction into the host cell, and thereby are replicated along with the host genome. An "expression vector* is a type of vector that can direct the expression of a chosen polynucleoode.<br>
A rmcleoride sequence is "operabfy linked" to a regulatory sequence if the regulatory sequence afTects the expression {e.g., the leveL tiraing, or locarion of expression) of the nucleotide sequence. A "regulatory secne-nce'5 is a nucleic acid that afTects the expression {e.g., the level, Urning, or locauon of expression) of a nucleic acid to which it is operably linked. The regulatory sequence caru for example, exeri its effects directly on the regulated nucleic acid, or throngh the action of one or more oiher molecules (eg., Polypeptides that bind to the regulatory sequence an&amp;'or the nucleic acid). Examples of regulatory sequences inchide promoters, enhancers and other expression control elements {e.g.. polyadenylation Signals). Frrrthex examples of regulatory sequences are descnbed in, for example. GoeddeL 1990.

A uhost cell" is a cell that can be used to express a nucleic acicL e.g., a nucleic acid of the invention. A host cell can be a prokaryote. for example. E. coli, or it can be a eukaryote. for example. a single-ceHed eukaryote (e.g., a yeast or other fungus). a plant cell (e.g., a tobacco or tomato plant cell), an<br><br>

IGF-1R<br>
IGF-lRis a transmembrane reeeptor tyrosine kinase (Bhime-Jensen et al. 2001,Naüire 411:355-65). The human IGF-1R is synthesized as a 1367 amino aeid precursor Polypeptide that includes a 30 amino aeid Signal pepride removed dnring translocation iso the endoplasmic retieuhrrn (Swiss-Prot: P08069). Tne 1GF-1R proreeeptor is glycosylated and ckaved by 2 protease at positions 708-711 (counting firom the first amino aeid following the signal peptide sequence) dnring maturation in the ER-golgi resultmg in the fonnation of an a-chain (1-707) and a ß-chain (712-1337) thai remain linked by disuinde bonds (Bhaumick ei al, 1981, Proc Natl Acad Sei USA 78:4279-53, Chemausek et al., 1981, Biochemistry 20:7345-50, Jacobs et al, 1983, Proc Natl Acad Sei USA 80:1228-31, LeBon et al, 1986, J Biol Chem 261:7635-89, EUeman, er al, 2000, Biochem J 347:771-79). The predorninant form of the IGF-1R (and INSR) that exists on the cell-surface is a proteolytically processed and glycosylated (aß)2 dimer joined covalently by ODe or more disulSde bonds.<br>
The extracellular portion of the IGF-1R consists of ihe a-chain and 191 amino aeids of the ß-chain (712-905). The reeeptor contains a single transmembrane spanning seqnence (906-929) and a 408-residue cytoplasmic domain that includes a functional tyrosine kinase (Rubin et al. 1983, Natnre 305:438-440). Comparative sequence analysis has revealed that the IGF-1R is composed of 11 distinet structural motifs (reviewed by Adams etal, 2000, Cell Mol Life Sei 57:1050-93, Marino-Buslje et al, 1998, FEBS Ltrs 441:331-36, Ward et al, 2001, BMC Bioinformatics 2:4). The N-terminal half of the extracellular domain contains two homologous comains referred to as LI (1-151) and L2 (299-461) (Ward et al, 2001, supra) separated by a cysteine-rich (CR) region (152-298) consisting of several structural modules with disulfide<br><br>
iinkages that abgn with repeating units present in tbe TNF receptor and lamimn (Waid et at.. 1995, Proteins 22:141-53). The crystal structnre of the LI—CR-L2 domain has been solved (Garrett et aL, 1998. Nature 394:395-99). Tbe L2 domain is followed by tbree fibronectin type m domains (Marino-Buslje et o/..,1998. suprcL Mulbern et al., 1998, Trends Biocbem Sei 23:465-66, Ward et al, 1999, Growrb Factors 16*315-22). The first Fnin domain (FnEH-l, 461-579) is 118 amino aeids in length. The second Fnlü domain (FnIÜ-2L 580-798) is dismpted by a major insert sequence (TD) of about 120 amino aeids in length. Tbe ID domain incrades a furin protease cleavage site that separates tbe a and ß cbams of tbe mamre receptor. The trdrd FnHI domain (FnIH-3) is locaied entirely in tbe ß-chain (799-901) tenniiiating several residnes before tbe tiansmembraiie sequence. Tbe catalytic domain of tbe 1GF-1R tyrosme kinase is located between ^mmfi aeids positions 973-1229. and its stxucorre bas been solved (Faverynkis et al.. 2001, Natnre Structnral Bk&gt;l 8:1058-63. Pantsch et aL, 2001, Structnre 9:955-65). Tbe kinase is üanked by two regntetory regions, tbe jirr^rrrf-mhr?™&gt; region (930-972) and a 108 amino aeid C-tennina] tau (1220-1337) (Surrnacz et al, 1995, Experimenlal Cell Res 21S:370-80; Hongo etal., 1996. Oncogene 12:1231-38). The two regülatory regions contain ryrosine residnes that serve as docking sites for signal transducing proteins wben pbospborylated by tbe activatedIGF-lRtyrosine kinase (reviewed by Baserga (ed.), 1998 The IGF-1 Recepior in Normal and Abnormal Growth, Honnones and Growth Factors in Development and Neoplasia. WDey-Liss. Inc., Adams et al, 2000, CeU Mol Life Sei 57:1050-93).<br>
Tbe IGF-1R amino arid sequence is about 70% identical to tbe insulin receptor (INSR; Swiss-Prot: P06213). The bighest homology between tbe reeeptors is located in the tyrosine kinase domain (84%); tbe lowest idenüry is in the CR region and the C-terminus. The IGF-IR is also highly related (- 55% identical) to tbe insulin related receptor (IRR; Swiss-Prot: P14616).<br>
Human IGF-IR can be activated by the insulin-like growth factors, IGF-1 and IGF-2 and insulin" (INS) (Hill et aL, 1985: Pediatric Research 19:879-86). IGF-1 and IGF-2 are encoded nonallelic genes (Brissenden et aL, 1984, Nature 310: 781-8, Bell et aL, 1985, Proceedings of tbe National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 82: 6450-54), and both genes express alternative proteins retaisd by differential RNA splicing and protein processing. Tbe most common and well-studied matuxe forms of IGF-1 and IGF-2 are respectively 70 and 67 amino aeids in length (Jansen et al.. 1983. Nature 306:609-: l, Dull et aL, 1984. Nature 310: 777-81). These proteins (and their isoforms) are identical at 11/21 posrnons to the insulin A-peptide, and identical at 12/30 positions wirb tbe insulin B-peptide.<br>
IGF-IR is expressed in all cells rypes in tbe normal adult anirnal except for liver hepatoeyres znd<br>
rnarure B-cells. Human bloodplasma contains high concenrrarjons of IGF-1 and IGF-2. and IGF-1 cznbe<br>
detected in most tissues. The receptor is an integral component of tbe pbysiological meebanism Controlling<br>
organ size and bomeostasis. Without being bound to a particular theory. the "Somatomedin Hypothesis^<br>
states that Growth Hormone (GH) mediated somatic growth that oecurs during chüdbood and adolescence	.   . -.<br>
is dependent on the endocrine form of IGF-1 that is mainry produced and secretedby the bver (Daugbaday. 2000, Pediatric Nephrology 14: 537^0). Tbe synthesis of hepatic IGF-1 is stimulated by GH release in tbe pituitary in response to hypothalamic GHRH (GH releasing bormone). The serum concentration of IGF-1 increases over 100 fold between ages 5-15 in bumans.

mtigen bindrng proteins<br>
In one aspect, the present invention provides antigen binding proteins {e.g. antibodies, antibody ragments, antibody derivatives, antibody nmteins, and antibody variants), thatbind to IGF-1R, e.g.. human GF-1R.<br>
Antigen binding proteins in accordance with the present invention include antigen binding proteins hat inhibit a biological activity of IGF-1R Examples of such biological activrües include binding a ;ignaling molecule {e.g., IGF-1 and/or IGF-2), and transducing a signal in response to binding a signaling nolecule.<br>
Different antigen binding proteins may bind to diffeTent domains or epitopes of IGF-1R or act by lifferent mechanisms of action. Examples include but are not limited to antigen binding proteins that nterfere with binding of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 to IGF-1R or that inhibit signal transduction. The site of iction may be, for example, intracellular (e.g., by interfering with an intracellular signaling cascade) or sxtraceUuIar. An antigen binding protein need not completely inhibit an IGF-1 and/oi IGF-2 induced activity to find use in the present invention; rather, antigen binding proteins that reduce a particulax activity of IGF-1 an&amp;'or IGF-2 are contemplatec for use as well. (Discussioris herein of paracular roechanisins of action for IGF-lR-binding antigen binding proteins in treating particular diseases are illustrative only, and the methods presented herein are not bound thereby.)<br>
It has been observed that IGF-1 and IGF-2 each exhfbrts biphasic binding to IGF-1R. High affmity binding has been reported to have a KD in me ränge of 0.2 nM; high affmity binding, about ten fold higher. Thus. in one embodiment, the present invention provides an IGF-1R inhibitor that inhibits both the high and low afanity binding of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 to IGF-R It has been suggested that the high aifinity binding, rather than the low afnnity binding, of IGF-1 and;or IGF-2" to IGF-1R is required for the confonnation change that activates the tyrosine kinase activity of IGF-1R. Thus, in another embodiment the IGF-1R inhibitor preferentially inhibits the high afünity binding of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 to IGF-1R as compared to the low affmity binding.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides antigen binding proteins that comprise a light chain variable region selected from the group consisting of LI through L52 and/or a heavy chain variable region selected from the group consisting of Hl through R52, and fxagrnents, derivatives, muteins. and<br><br>

The dimer can be made by, for example, inserting a gene fusion encoding the fusion protein into an appropriate expression vector. expressing the gene fusion in host cells transformed with the recombinant expression vector. and aUowing the expressed fusion protein to assemble much Hks antibody molecules, whereupon interchain disulfide bonds form between the Fe moieties to yield the dimer.<br>
The term "Fe Polypeptide" as used herein includes native and mutein forms of Polypeptides derived from the Fe region of an antibody. Truncated forms of such Polypeptides containiag the hinge region that premotes dimerization also are included. Fusion proteins comprising Fe moieties (and oligomers formed tbereSrom) offer the advantage of facile purificatioü by afnnity chromatography over Protein A or Protein G columns.<br>
One suitable Fe Polypeptide, described in PCT applicauon WO 93/10151 (hereby incorporated by reference), is a singie chain Polypeptide extending from the N-tenmnal hinge region to the native C-terminns of the Fe region of a human IgGl antibody. Another useful Fe Polypeptide is the Fe mutein described in U.S. Patent 5:457;035 and in Baum et al, 1994. EMBO J. 13:3992-4001. The arnino aeid sequence of this mrr.ein is identical to that of the native Fe sequence presented in WO 93/10151. except that arnino arid 19 has been changed from Leu to Ala. amino aeid 20 has been changed from Leu to Glu, and amino aeid 22 has been changed from Gly to .Ala. Tne mutein exhibits reduced afnnity for Fe reeeptors.<br>
In other embodiments. the variable poraon of the heavy and
Altematively, the oligomer is a fusion protein cornprising multiple antigen binding proteins, with er wrihoul peptide linkers (spacer peptides). Among the suitable peptide linkers are those described in U.S. Patents 4,751,180 and 4,935,233.<br>
Another method for preparing oligomeric antigen binding proteins involves use of a leucine zipper. Leucine ziuper domains are peptides that promote oligomerization of the proteins in which they are found.<br><br>
Leucine zippers were originally identüied in several DNA-binding proteins (Laaaschuls et al. 1988. Science 240:1759). and have since been found in s variety of difFsrem proteins. Among the kaown leucine zippers are naturally o-ccuiring peptides and derivatives thereof that dimerize or trimerize. Examples of leucine ziDper rionsHs suitable foi producirg sc'^ble oHgoroeric proteins are described in PCT application WO 94/10308, and the leucine zipper derivec rom hing Surfactant protein D (SPD) described in Hoppe et al.. 1994. FEBS Leiters 344:191. hereby incoeporsted by reference. The usc of a modified leucine zipper that aliows for stähle tnincnzation of a heterwoeous piotein fhsed fbexetu is described in Fanslow et al, 1994, Semin. IrmmmoL 6:267-78. In one ^miA-4i recmiirM.'iynTfhskmproteins comprising an anti- IGF-1R antibody' iragment or derivative fused to 2 ViM.inri zipper peptide are expressed in suitable host cells, and the sorable oligomeric anti- 1GF-IR antibody ragmenB or derivatives ifeat form are recovexed frorn the culture supemaianT.<br>
In one aspect The present invention ^xrhäes antigen bmdmg piotsiiis that interfere wrfh rhe binding of IGF-1 and^or IGF-2 to an IGF-1 R Such antigen brrvfag proerrns can be made against IGF-IR, or a fxagmeirt variant OT derivative thexeofL and screeued in convemiösa] assays for the abiliiy to interfere witb binding of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 to IGF-IR Exarnples of STtirabk assays are assays that test the antigen binding proteins for the abiliry to inhibit binding of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 to cells expressing IGF-IR. or that test antigen binding uroteias for the ability to reducs a biological or ceHnlar response that results &amp;ora the binding of IGF-1 and'oi IGF-2 to cell surface IGF-1"R reeeptors.<br>
In another aspect the present invention provides an antigen binding protein that blocks the binding of IGF-1 and'br IGF-2 to IGF-IR but does not significantly block the binding of insulin to insulin reeeptor (INS-R). In one embodiment, the antigen binding protein does not bind to INS-R In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein binds to the INS-R with such a low affrmty that it does not effectively block the binding of insulin to ENS-R. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein binds to INS-R, but antigen binding protein-bound INS-R can stiH bind to insulin. In another embodiment, the antigen binding protein*s selectivity for IGF-1R is at least 50 rmes grearsr than its selectivity for insulin reeeptor. In another embodiment the selectivity- of the zrhgen binding protein is more than 100 times greater than its selectivity for insulin reeeptor.<br>
In another aspect the present invention prevides an antigen binding protein that demonstrates speoies selectivity. In one embodiment the airigen binding protein binds to one or more rnammalian IGF-IR for example, to human IGF-IR and one or more of mouse. rat guinea pig, hamster. gerbil, cat. rabbit dog. goat sheep, cow, horse. cameL and non-hnman prirnate IGF-IR. In another embodiment the antigen binding protein binds to one or more prirnate IGF-IR, for example. to human IGF-1R and one or more of cynomologous. rnarrnoset rhesus, and chimpanzee IGF-IR. In another embodiment the antigen binding protein binds specincally to human, cynomologous. marmoset rhesus, or chimpanzee IGF-1R. In another embodiment the antigen binding protein does not bind to one or more of mouse, rat, guinea pig, hamster, gerbil, cat rabbit dog, goat sheep, cow, horse, camel, and non-human primate IGF-IR. In another embodiment the antigen binding protein does not bind to a New World monkey species such as a rnarrnoset. In another embodiment the antigen binding protein does not exhibit specific binding to anv naturally orairring protein other than IGF-1R In another embeniirnent, the antigen binding protein does not exhibit specific binding to any naturally oecurring protein othex than mammalian IGF-1R. In another<br><br>
embodiment, the antigen binding protein does not exhibit specific binding to any naturally occurnng protein other thg-n primäre IGF- 1R. In another embodiment the antigen binding protein does not e&gt;±ibit specific binding to any naturally occxtrring protein othcr than human IGF-IR. In another embodiment the Antigen binding protein speciücaily binds to mouse. rat cynomolgus monkey, and human IGF-IR. In another embodiment. the antigen binding protein specincally binds to mouse. rat, cynomolgus monkey, and 'i » -^ IGF-1R with a srmiLax binding af&amp;nity. In another embodiment the antigen binding protein blocks bbdmg of human IGF-1 and IGF-2 with mouse, rat, cynomolgus monkey. and hnman IGF-IR. In another embodnnent the antigen binding protein blocks binding of human IGF-1 and IGF-2 with mouse. rat cynomolgus monkey. and human IGF-IR with srmilar K,;. In another emfoodiincnt the antigen binding protein blocks binding of human IGF-1 and IGF-2 with monse, rat. cynomolgus monkey. and human IGF-1R with a K; of between about 0.57 and about 0.61 n.M.<br>

In another aspect the present invention provides an IGF-1R binding antigen binding protem (for exampie. an anti-IGF-lR antibody), that has one or more of the following characteristics: binds 10 hoch human and murine IGF-IR, inhibits the binding of both IGF-1 and IGF-2 to human IGF-IR, rnhibits the binding of both IGF-1 and IGF-2 to murine IGF-IR, preferentially rnhibits the high affinity binding of IGF-1 and/or of IGF-2 to IGF-IR. binds to the L2 domain of IGF-IR, causes relatively little down-regulation of cell-surface expressed IGF-1 R after 17 bours of exposure (as compared to MAB391 (R&amp;D Systems. Minneapolis. MK); e.g.. amount of IGF-IR is reduced by less than 20%). causes a level of down-regulation of cell-surface expressed IGF-IR on Colo-205 or MiaPaCa-2 xenografc tumor cells in mice as MAB391 after four weeks of once weekly doses of 200 micrograms.<br>
Antigen-bmding fragments of antigen binding proteins of the invention may be prodnced by couventional Techniques. Examples of such fragments incfude, but are not limited to, F2b and F(ab*)_<br>
fragments. Antibody fragments and derivatives procuced by genetic engineering techniques also are contemp lated.<br>
Additional embodiments include chimeric antibodies, e.g., humanized versions of non-buman (e.g.. rrjurinej monoclonal antibodies. Such humanized antibodies may be prepared by known techmques. and offer the advantage of reduced immun ogeniciry vvhen the antibodies are admindstered to humans. In one embodiment a humanized monoclonal antibody comprises the variable domain of a murine antibody (or all or part of the antigen binding site thereof) and a constant domain derived fjom a human antibody. Afternatively, a humanized antibody fragment may comprise the antigen binding site of a rnurine monoclonal antibody and a variable domain fragment (tedring the antigen-binding site) derived from a human antibody. Procedures for the procucrion of chimeric and farther engineered monoclonal antibodies include those described in Riechmann et al. 1988, Nature 332:323. Liu et al, 1987, Proc. Nat Acad. Sei. USA 84:3439. Lamck et al, 1989, Bio/Technology 7:934; and Winter et al., 1993, 7TPS 14:139. In one embodiment the chimeric antibody is a CDR grafted antibody. Techniques for humanizieg antibodies are discussed in, e.g., U.S. Pat App. No. 10/194,975 (pubhshed February 27: 2Ö03), U.S. Pat. No.s 5,S69:619;<br><br>

Procedura havc been developed for generating human or partially human antibodies in non-mrman animals. For example, mice in which cme or more endogenous rmnöimoglobuhx genes have been inactivated by various means have been preparedL Human immunoglobulin genes have been introdnced ruto the raice to replace the inactivated mouse genes.

In anomer aspect the present invention provides monoclonal aritibodies mat bind to IGF-1R. Monoclonal antibodies may be produced using any technique known in the art e.g., by irnmortalizing spieen cells harvestsd from the transgenic anirnal after completion of the immtmizarion schedule. The spieen cells can be irrrnortalized using any technique known in the art eg., by fusing them with myeloma cells to produce hybridomas. Myeloma cells for use in hybridoma-producing fusion proceduies preferably are non-antrbody-producing, have high fusion efSciency. and enzyme deficiencies that render them incapabie of grovy-ing in certain selective media which support the growm of only the desrred fused cells (hybridemas). Examples of suitable cell lines for use inmouse fusions include Sp-20, P3-X63/Ag8, P3-<br><br>
X63-AgS.653s NSl/l.Ag4 L Sp210-Agl4, F0: NSO/U MPC-II.. MPC11-X45-GTG 3.7 and S394/5XX0 Bui; examples of cell lines used in rat fusions include R210.RCY3, Y3-Ag 1.2.3, IRSS3F and 4B210. Öfter cell lines useful for cell fusions are U-266, GM1500-GRG2, LICR-LOK-HMy2 and UC729-6.<br>
In one embodiment a hybridoma cell line is produced by innrniniziEg an p^imal (e.g.. a transgenic anirr.al having human innmmoglobuliD sequences) wirb an IGF-1R inrmuaogcii; harvesnng spieen cells from the immunized animal; fusing the harvested spieen cells to a myeloma cell line, therefcy generating hybridoina cells: establishing hybridoiua cell lines from the bybridoma cells. and idennfying a bybridoma cell line that prodnces an antibody that binds an IGF-1R Polypeptide. Such bybridoma cell hnes. and. anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antfDodies produced by mem, are encompassed by the present invention<br>
Monoclonal antibodies secreted by a hybridoma cell line can be pnrified nsmg any technique known in the an. Hybridomas or mAbs may be mrther screened to idenrify mAbs witnparticular propernes, such as the abiliiy to block an 1GF-1 and'or IGF-2 indnced acüviiy. Exarnples of such screens are provided in the examples below.<br>
Molecular evohition of the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) in the center of the antibody binding site also has been used to isolate antibodies wirb increased aiSnity, for example. antibodies havirig increased affiniry for c-erbB-2, as described by Schier et cl„ 1996. J. Mol. Biol. 263:551. Accordingly. such techniques are useful in preparing antibodies to IGF-1R.<br>
Antigen binding proteins directed against an TGF-1R can be used, for example, in assays to detect the presence ofIGF-lR Polypeptides, either in vitro or in vrvo. The antigen binding proteins also may be employed in purirying IGF-1R proteins by immunoaffinity chromatography. Those antigen binding proteins that additionally can block binding of IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 to IGF-1R may be used to inhibit a biological acrivity that results from such binding. Blocking antigen binding proteins can be used in the metheds of the present invention. Such antigen binding proteins tbat fanetion as IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 antagonists may be employed in treating any IGF-1 and'or IGF-2-induced condition, including hur not limited to cancer. In one embodiment, a human anti- 1GF-1R monoclonal antibody generated by procedures involving immtmization of transgenic rrice is employed in treating such conditions.<br>
Antigen binding proteins may be employed in an in vitro procedura, or administered in vivo to inhibit an IGF-1 and'or IGF-2-induceo biological activiry. Disorders eaused or exaeerbated (directly or indirectly) by the interaenon of IGF-1 and/or-IGF-2 vririi cell sumee IGF-1 R. examples of which are provided above, thus may be treated. In one embodiment, the present invention provides a therapeutic method comprising in vivo adiroinistration of an IGF-1 and'or IGF-2 blocking antigen binding protein to a mammal in need thereof in an amount effective for reducing an IGF-1 and'or IGF-2-induced biological activiry.<br>
Antigen binding proteins of the invention include partiaily human and fuüy human monoclonal antibodies that inhibit a biological activity of IGF-1 and also inhibit a biological activity of IGF-2. One embodiment is directed to a human monoclonal antibody that at least partiaily blocks binding of IGF-1 and of IGF-2 to a cell that expresses human IGF-1R. In one embodiment, the antibodies are generated bv immunizing a transgenic mouse with an IGF-1R immunogen In another embodiment, the immunogen is a human IGF-IR Polypeptide (e.g.. a soluble fragment comprising all or part of the IGF-1R extracellular<br><br>
omain). Hybridoma cell lines derived from such irnmunized mke, wherein the hybridoma secretes a lonoclonal antibody that binds IGF-1R, also are provided herein<br>
Although human, partially human, or humanized antibodies will be suitable for rnany applications, srccularly those involving administration of the antibody to a human subject other types of atirigen inding proteins will be suitable for certain applications. The non-human antibodies of the invention can c, for example. derived from any anul)ody-producing animal, such as mouse, rat rabbit. goat, donkey. or on-taman psimate (such as monkey (e.g., cynomologous or ihesus monkey) or ape (e.g.. chnnpanzee)). 4oQ-hEmaB smbodies of me invention can be used, for example, in in vitro and cell-cuhnrc based ppöcatiaas. or any oÜier appbcahon wnere an immune response to the antibody of me invention does not iccar, is rnsignrocant can be prevenied, is not a concern, or is desired. In one emboditnent a non-human saibody of "die invention is adininistered to a non-human subject. In another embodimenL the non-human mtibody does not elicit an nnmune response in the non-human subject. In anofher ernbodiment, the non-snnan antibody is from the sarne species as me non-human subject. e.g.. a mouse antibody of the invention s adinmisTcred to a mouse. An antibody from a particular species can be made by. for example. tmrnnp-izing an anirnal ofthat species with the desired immunogen (e.g., a soluble IGF-iR Polypeptide) or using an arüfrcial System for generating antibodies ofthat species (ß.g., a bacterial or phage display-based system for generating antibodies of a particular species). or by Converting an antibody from one species into an antibody from another species by replacing, e.g.s the constant region of the antibody -with a constant regioE from me other species, or by replacing one or more amino acid residues of the antibody so that it more closely resembles the sequence of an antibody from the other species. In one ernbodiment, the antibody is a chimeric antibody comprising amino acid sequences derived from antibodies from rwo or more cifferent species.<br>
Antigen binding proteins may be prepared by any of a number of conventional techniques. For example. they may be purüied from cells that naturally express them (e.g., an antibody can be puxified from a hybridcma that produces it). or produced in recombinant expression Systems, using any technique known in the art See. for example. Monoclonal Antibodies, Hybridomas: A Are~.v Dimension in Biological Analyses. Kennet ex ah (eds.). Plenum Press, New York (1980); and Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Harlow and Land (eds.). Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. Geld Spring Harbor, NY, (1988).<br>
Any expression system known in the art can be ^astd to make the recombinant Polypeptides of the invention. In general, host cells are transformed with a recombinant expression vector that comprises DNA encoding a desired Polypeptide. Among the host cells that may be employed are prokaryotes, yeast or higher eukaryotic cells. Prokaryotes include gram negative or gram positive organisms. for example E. coli or bacilli. Higher eukaryotic cells include insect cells and established cell lines of marrrrnahan origin. Examples of suitable mammalian host cell lines include the COS-7 line of monkey kidney cells (ATCC CR! 1651) (Gluzman et aL 1981, Cell 23:175), L cells, 293 cells, C127 cells, 3T3 cells (ATCC CCL 163), Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, HeLa cells, BHK (ATCC CRL 10) cell lines, and the CV1/EBNA cell line derived from the African green monkey kidney cell line CVI (ATCC CCL 70) as described by McMahan ei ah, 1991. EMBO J. 10:2821. Appropriate cloning and expression vectors for use with bacterial. fungal, yeast, and mammalian ceilrilar hosts are described by Pouwels et ah {Cloning Vectors: A Laboratory Manual, Elsevier. New York, 1985).<br><br>
The rransformed cclis can be cultured under conditions that promote expression of tbe Polypeptide. and the pol&gt;peptide recovered by Conventions! protein puritication procedures. One such puriftcation procedura indudcs the uss of afrmity chromatography, e,g., over a matrix having all or a portion (e.g., the extracellular domain) of IGF-IR banne thereto. Polypeptides contemplated for use herein include substaiirialiy homogencous recombinant -nsT^mg'igr. anti- IGF-IR antibody Polypeptides substantiaUy free of contarninating endogenocs materials.<br>
Andgen biading i»**»iiw&gt; may be preparcä, sad screened fox desired properties. by any of a number of known techrnques. Cerzs&amp;L of tbe tscänäqnes involve isoiating a nncleic- acid encoding a Polypeptide chain (or portion thereoi) of an autigea binöing proem of imcresi (e.g.. an anti-IGF-lR antibody), and -nanipmlatTnp nie nuclek acki throogh recozobiisani DNA Technology.  Tbe nucleic acid may be fused to artother nncleic acid of Lutaest or altered (e.g_ by rrasageBesis or other conventional techniquss) to adö. delete. or suhstiLiir one or more *u*nr» acid residnes, for exzmple.<br>
In one aspect. the t^esent iüventiozi provides antigen-binding fragments of an anti-IGF-lR antibody of the invention. Such fragrrjerirs can consst enrirely of antibody-derived sequences or can comprise additiona! seqoences. Exaxoples of antigen-bmding fragments include Fab. F(ab')2, Single chain antibodies, diabodies, triabodies, retrabodies. and domain antibodies.  Other examples are provided in Lunde et al, 2Ö02: Biocbeca. Soc. Trans. 30:500-06.<br>
Single chain antibodies may be formed by ünking heavy and light chain variable domain (Fv region) fragments via an ammo acid bridge (shon Peptide linker), resulting in a Single Polypeptide chain. Such sing]e-chain Fvs (scFvs) have beer) prepared by fusing DNA encoding a peptide linker between DNAs encoding the rwo variable domain Polypeptides (VL and Vj.;). The resulting Polypeptides can fold back on themselves to form antigen-bmding monomers, or they can form rnultimers (e.g., dimers, trimers. or tetramers). depending cn tbe lengrh of a flexible linker between the rwo variable domains (Kortt et ah, 1997.. Prot Eng. 10:423: Korn et ed.. 2001, BiomoL Eng. 18:95-108). By combining different VL and VH-comprising Polypeptides, coe can form nroltimeric scFvs that bind to different epitopes (Kriangkum ei ah, 2001, Biomol. Eng. 18:31-40). Techniques devclopec for tbeproduetion of Single chain antibodies include those described in U.S. Patent No. 4;946,778; BirdL 19SS: Science 242:423: Huston ei a!.s 1988, Proc. Nati Acad. Sei.

In another aspect the present invention provides an antigen binding protein that binds to the L2 domain of human IGF-1R. Antigen binding proteins that bind to the L2 domain can be made using any technique known in the art For example. such antigen binding proteins can be isolated using the fuU-length IGF-1R Polypeptide (e.g.. in a membrane-bound preparation), a soluble extracellular domain fragment of IGF-1R (an example of v/hich is provided in Example 1), or a smaller fragment of the IGF-1R extracellular domain comprising or consisting of the L2 domain (examples of which are provided in Example 10). Antigen binding proteins so isolated can be screened to deterrnine their binding speciücity using any method known rn the art (an example of which is provided in Example 10).<br>
In another aspect the present invention provides an antigen binding protein that binds to human IGF-1R expressed on the surface of a cell and, when so bound, inhibits IGF-1R signaiing activity in the cell without causing a signiücant recuction in the amount of TGF-1R on the surface of the cell. Any method for determining or estimaüng the amount of IGF-1R on the surface and or in the inferior of the cell can be iiseä. In one embodiment the present invention provides an antigen binding protein that binds to me L2 domain of a human 1GF-1R expressed on the surface of a cell and. when so bound. inhibits IGF-1R signaling activity in the cell without significantly increasing the rate of internalizaticn of the 1GF-1R from the surface of the cell. In orher embodiments. binding of the antigen binding protein to the IGF- IR-expressing cell causes less man ahout 75%, 50%: 40%, 30%, 20%, 15%, 10%, 5%. 1%, or 0.1% of the cell-surface 1GF-1R to be iniernaiized. In another aspect binding of the antigen binding protein to the IGF-lR-expressing cell causes a gradual reduction in the amount of IGF-1R on the cell surface such that within a few hours of contacüng the cell wirb the antigen binding protein, lirtle or no decrease in cdl surface IGF-1R is detected, but aller several days or weeks of exposure of the cell to the antigen binding protein, a marked decrease in cell surface IGF-iR is detected.<br><br>
In another aspect the present invention provides an antigen bindmg protein having a half-life of at least one day in vitro or in vfvo (e.g-, when adrninistered to a human subiect). In one exnbodixnent the antigen binding protein has a half-life cf at leasi ihres days. in another ernbodimsnt, the antigen binding protein has a half-life of four cays or longer. In another embodiment the antigen binding protein has a half-life of eight days or longer. In another ernbodirnent the antigen binding protein is derivatized or modined such that it has a longer half-life as compared to the underivatized or unmodiiied antigen binding protein. In another embodrroerjl the antigen binding protein confratns one or more poirxr mntations to increase serum half liie. such as described in "WO 00/09560, published Feb_24. 2000. mcorporated by reference.<br>

Moreover, bispecinc antigen binding protein as disclosed herein can comprise an IGF-1R binding site from one of the herein-described antibodies and a second IGF-1R binding region from another of the herein-described antibodies, mcluding those described herein by reference to other pubücations. Altematively. a bispecinc antigen binding protein rnay comprise an antigen binding site from one of the herein described antibodies and a second antigen binding site from another IGF-1R antibody that is known in the art or from an antibody that is prepared by known methods or the methods described herein,<br>
Numerous methods of preparing bispecifk antibodies are known in the art and discussed in US Patent Application 09/839.632, filed April 20. 2001 (incorporated by reference herein). Such methods include the use of hybrid-hybridomas as described by Milsteia et al., 1983, Nature 305:537, and others (U.S. Patent 4,474:893. U.S. Patent 6.106.833). and chemical coupling of antibody fragments (Brennan et aL1985, Science 229:81; Glennie et a/.,19S7: J. IrnmunoL 139:2367: U.S. Patent 6,010,902). Moreover, bispeci&amp;c antibodies can be proöuced via recombinant means. for example by nsing leucrne zipper moieties (i.e.. from the Fos and Jun proteins, which preferentially form hetexodimers; Kostelny et al., 1992; J. Irnmnol. 14S:I547) or other lock and key interactive domain structures as described in U.S. Patent 5.582,996. Acditional useful techniques include those described in Kom ex cL 1997. supra; U.S. Patent 5,959,083; and U.S. Patent 55S07:706.<br>
In another aspect, the antigen binding protein of the present invention comprises a derivative of an antibody. The derivatized antibody can compnse any molecule or suhsrance that imparts a desired property to the antibody, such as increased half-life in z. particular use. The derivatized antibody can comprise. for example, a detectable (or labeling) moiety (e.g., a radioactive. colorimeiric. antigenic or enzymatic molecule, a detecable bead (such as a magnetic or elecirodense (e.g.. gold) bead), or a molecule that binds to another molecule (e.g.. biotin or streptavidin)). a therapeutic or oiagnostic xnciety (e.g.. a radioactive, cytotoxic. or pharmaceutically active moietyj. or a molecule that increases the suitabihty of the antibody for a particular use (e.g., administration to a subject. such as a human subj&amp;ct or other in vivo or in vitro uses). Hxarrrples of molecule s that can be used to derivatize an antibody include aFDumin (e.g-.. human serum alburnin) and Polyethylene glycol (PEG). Albumin-Iiriked and PEGylaied derivatives of antibodies can be prepared using techniques well known in the an. In one ernbodirnent the antibody is conjugated or othenvise linked Xo nansthyretin (TTR) or a TTR variant. Tne TTR or TTR variant can be chemically<br><br>
modified with. for example, a chemical selected from the group consisting of dextran, poly(n-vinyl pyurxolidone), Polyethylene glycols, propropylene glycol homopoiymers, polypropylene oxids/ethylene oxide co-polymers, polyoxyefhylated polyols and polyvinyl alcohols.

In ancther aspect, the preseni invention provides methods of Screening for a molecule that binds to IGF-1R using the antigen hinding proteins of the present invention Any svhtable Screening technique can be used. hx one erhbodirnent, an IGF-1R molecule, or a fxagment thereof to which an antigen binding protein of the present invention binds, is contacted with the antigen binding protein of the invention and with aoother molecule. wherein the othex moiecule binds to IGF-1R if it reduces the binding of the antigen binding protein to IGF-1R. Binding of the antigen binding protein can be detected using any surtable rnethoG- e.g., an ELISA. Detection of binding of the antigen binding protein to IGF-1R can be sirnplified by detectabiy labeling the antigen binding protein- as discussed above. In another embodimenl the IGF-*R4-vmrrng molecule is funher analyzed to detsxxnine wherher it rnhibits IGF-1R,IGF-1, and/ox IGF-2-mediated siginling.<br>
Nucleic acids<br>
In one aspect the present invention provides isolated nucleic acid molecules. The nucleic acids comprise, for example, polynucleotides that encode all or part of an antigen binding protein . for example, one or both charns of an antibody of the invention, er a fxagment, derivative- mutein, or variant thereof, polynucleotides suffkient for use as hybridizarion prohes, PCR primers or sequencing primers for identifying. analyzing, mutating or ampiifying a polynucleoride encoding a polypeptide. anti-sense nucleic acids for inhibiting expression of a polynucleoride, and complementary sequences of the foregoing. The nucleic acids canbe any length. They can be. for example. 5. 10. 15, 20,25, 30,35. 40.45. 50. 75, 100. 125, 150, 175, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 750, 1,000, 1,500, 3,000, 5,000 or more nucleondes in length, and'or can comprise one or more additional sequences, for example, regulatory sequences. and'or be pari of a '{arger nucleic acid, for example. a vector. The nucleic acids can be single-stranded or double-stranded and can comprise RNA and'or DNA nucleotides, and artificial variants thereof (e.g.. peptide nucleic acids).<br>
Nucleic acids encoding antibody Polypeptides (e.g,, beavy or light chain, variable dornain only. or füll lensrJi} mav be isolated from B-cells of mice that have been irnrnunized with IGF-1R. Tue nucleic acid may be isolated. by conventional procedures such as Polymerase chain reaction (PCR).<br>
Figure 1 provides nucleic acid sequences encoding the variable regions of the heavy and light chain variable regions shown in Figures 2 anc 3. The sküled artisan will appreciate that due to the degeneraey of the genetic code, each of the Polypeptide sequences in Figures 2 through 9 also is encoded bv a large number of other nucleic acid sequences. The present invention provides each degenerate nucleoride sequence encoding each antigen binding protein of the invention.<br>
The invention furthex provides nucleic acids that hybridize to other nucleic acids (e.g., nucleic acids cornprising a nucleoride sequence of Figure 1) under particülai hybridizarion condirions. Methods for hybridizina nucleic acids are well-known in the art.  See, e.g-.. Current Protocols in Molecular Biolosv John Wiley &amp; Sons, N.Y. (1989), 6.3.1-6.3.6. As defxned herein, a moderately stringent hybridizarion condition uses a prewashing Solution containing 5X sodiurn chloxide/sodium citrate (SSC), 0.5% SDS, 1.0 mM EDTA<br><br>
(pH 8.0), hybridization buffer of about 50% formamidc. 6X SSC. and a hybridization temperature of 55° C (or other srmiiar hybridization Solutions, such as one containing about 50% forma mi de. v,irh a nybridization temperature of 42r Q. and Nvashing condiuons of 60a C. in 0.5X SSC 0.1% SDS. A stringent hybridization eondksoc hybridizes m SX SSC at 45" C, foüowed by one or more washes in Ö.IX SSC. 0.2% SDS at 6SC C. Furcbsrmore, one of skül b the an car. rnanipulate the hybridization and/or washing conditicns to incrcasc or decrease the stringency of hybridization such that nucleic acids conrprising nucleotide sequeoccs thai are ai käst 65, 70: 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 98 or 99% identical to each other typically remain bybhdized to each ofcer. The basc parsmeteis afectmg the choice of hybridization conditioiis and gihdance for devisns snnable ccsxhricsjs are set form by. for example, Sambrook. Fritsch, and Maniatis (1989, Molecular Ckjoing: A Labcffaiory MsnnaL Cold Spring Harbox Laboratoiy Press. Colc Spring Haibor. N.Y., chapsrs 9 and 11; and Cuueui Protocols in Molecular Biology, 1995.

Changes can be mtrococed by irmaticn into a nucleic acid. rhereby leading tc changes in the amino acid sequence of a Polypeptide (e-g-, an antigen binding protein) that it encodes. Mutations can be introduced esing axry t^hrrknie fcoowi: in the art In one embodiment, one or more parricular amino acid residues are changed using. for exarnple. 2 sxte-directjed rrmtagenesis protocoL In another ernbodirnent one or more randomly selected residues is cbsnged using. for example, a random mutagenesis protocoL However it is made. a mutant polypepride can be expressed and screened for a desired property (e.g.. binding to 1GF-IR or blockmg the binding of IGF-1 and'or IGF-2 to IGF-1R).<br>
Mutations can be introduced rnro a nucleic acid without significantly altering the biological activitv of a Polypeptide that it encodes. For example, one can make nucleotide substitutions leading to amino acid suhsriturioiis at non-essenri2l amino acid residues. In one embodiment, a nucleotide sequence provided in Figuxe I, or a desired fragment, vaxiant, er derivative thereof, is mutated such that it encodes an arnino acid secuence comprising one or mors deletions or substitations of arnino acid residues that are shown in Fi gares 2 rhrough 9 to be residnes where t\vo or more sequences differ. In another embodiment. the mutagenesis mserts an arnino acid adjacent to one or more amino acid residues shown in Figures 2 through 9 to be residues where two or more sequences differ. Altcmatively, one or more mutations can be introduced mtc a nucleic acid that selectively change the biological aenvity (e.g., binding of IGF-1 R. inhibiting IGF-1 and/or IGF-2. etc.) ofa Polypeptide that it encodes. For example, the mutation can quantitative ly or quaiitarively change the biological aenvity. Examples of quantitative changes include increasing, reducing or elinnnating the acüvity. Examples of qualitative changes include changing the antigen speciücity of an antigen binding protein.<br>
In another aspect the present ievention pro\ides nucleic acid molecules that are suitable for use as primsrs or hybridization probes for the detection of nucleic acid sequences of the invention. A nucleic acid molecule of the rnvennon can comprise orüy a portion of a nucleic acid sequence encodmg a full-lerigth Polypeptide of the invention. for example, a fragment that can be used as a probe or primer or a fragment eacoding an aenve portion (e.g., an IGF-1R binding portion) ofa polypepride of the invention.<br>
Probes based on the sequence ofa nucleic acid of the invention can be used to detect the nucleic acid or sirnilsj nucleic acids, for example. transcripts encoding a polypepride of the invention. The probe<br><br>
can cornprise a labe! groiro, e.g., a radioisotope, a fruorescenl ccapounti, an enzyme. or an enzyme co factor. Such probes canbe used to identify a cell that expresses the Polypeptide.<br>
In another aspect the present invention provides vectors cornprismg a nucleic aeid enccKJing a Polypeptide of The invention or £ portion thereof. Examples o: V-CJDTS include. but are not limited to, Plasmids, viral vectors, nou-episomal manamalian vectors and rxpression vectors, for example, recombinant expression vectors.<br>
The recombinant expression vectors of the invention OB. coaoprise a nuciek aeid of the invention in a form suitable fbr expression of the nucleic arid in a host cc£_ The reccEabsnam esxiesscn vectors include one OT more regnlatory sequences, selected on ihe hasis of the bosx cslk to be Gseti ihr expression-which is operably linked to the nucleic aeid sequence to be expressed- Hesoiziasy sequences inciuee those lhat direct constinitrve expression of a nucleotide sequence in roany types of best celb (&amp;. g_, SV40 eany gene enhancer, Rons sarcoma virus prornoter and cytornegalcRTrus pranaoer). these frer direct expression of the nucleotide sequence only in certain host cells (e.g.. tissue-speeifie resnlaiory sequences, see Voss ei G!., 19S6.

Science 236:1237. rneorporaied by reference herein in theii entireries), and those that direct inducible expression of a rmcleotide sequence in response to parhcular treatment or condition (e.g., the metaHothionin prometex in m^i"inaVyn cells and the tet-responsive and/or streptonrycin Tesponsive promoter in both prokaryotic and eukaryode Systems (see id.). It will be appreciated by rhose skiHed in the art that the design of the expression vsetor can depend on such factors as the choiee of the host cell to be transformed, the level of expression of protein desired. etc. 'The expression vectors of the invention can be introcueed into host cells to thereby produce proteins or peptides. including fusion proteins or peptides. encoded by nucleic acics as described herein.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides host cells into which a recombinant expression vector of the invention has been introcueed. A host cell can be any prokaryotic cell (for example, E. coli) or eukaryotic cell (for example. yeast, insect, or mammaliar cells (e.g., CHO cells)). Vector DNA can be introcueed into niokaryotic or eukaryotic cells via convenheaai transformation or transfection techniques. For stable transfection of mammalian cells, ii is known thaL depending upon the expression vector and transfection technique used, only a small rraction of cells may unegrate the foreign DNA into tbeir genome. In order to identüy and select these integrants. a gene that encodes z selectable rnarker (e.g.. for resistance to annbiotics) is generally introduced into the host cells a:ong wrth me gene of interest. Freferred seleciable markers include these which confer resistance to drugs, such as G413, hygromyein and methotrexate.  Cells stably transfected wirb the imroduced nucleic aeid can be ideatined by drng selecrion (e.g., cells that have incorporated the selectable marker gene will survive, wnüe the other c-ells die), among other methods.<br>

These studies suggest that elevated TGF-1R expression. on the Order of 5-10 fold, is associated with favorable prognosis and biomarkers (ER.+ PR+). suggesting that estrogen and IGF cooperate in the rriaintenance or progression of well difTerentdated tumor.  Sirnilarly, estrogen has been shown to be essential for the growth and survival of the ER+ MCF-7 breast cancer cell Ihre, and in this context IGF-1R is ur&gt; regulated by estrogen treatment (reviewed in Eliis et al, 1998. Breast Cancer Research Sc Treatment 52: 175-84). Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of treating breast cancer in a subjeet in need of such treatment. cornprising adrninistering to the subjeet an effective amount of an IGF-1R antagonist as described herein. In another embodiment the method further comprises adrriinistering a horrnone rnbibitor. e.g., an estrogen inhibitor.<br>
A retrospective IGF-1 R IHC analysis has been reported for a collecdon of 12 colonic adenomas, 36 primary colorectal adenocarcinomas and 27 correspondmg metastases, and 34 adjacent normal tissues (Hakamerc/., 1999, Human Patbology. 30: 1I2S-33). The frequency of moderate to strong IHC staining appeared to dramatically increase vvith higher stage and tumor grade (0% normal vs. 93 % metastases). The results are consistent with RNA analysis by RNAss protection assay (**"R?A") (Freier ei al. 1999, Gut 44: 704-08). Thus. in one emboeiment the present invention provides a method of treating colon cancer in a subjeet in need of such treatment cornprising adrninistenng to the subjeet an effective amount of an IGF-1R antagonist as described herein.<br>
High plasma IGF-1 and reduced !GFbp3 h men 40-80 years old is associated with increased prostate cancer risk (Chan et al. 1998. Science 279: 563-6). High IGF-1 is associated with a risk of other Cancers including breast (Hankmson et al, 1998, Lancet 351: 1393-96), colon (Ma et al., 1999. Journal of the National Cancer Institute 91: 620-25) and hing (Yu et al.. 1999. Journal of the National Cancer Institute 91: 151-56). In transgenic mouse models. tumor ineidence is increased by IGF-1 overexpression in diverse locations (Bol et al, 1997, Oncogene 14: 1725-34; DiGiovanni et al.., 2000, Cancer Research 60: 1561-70: DiGiovanni ei al, 2000. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 97: 3455-60, Hadsell et al. 2000, Oncogene 19: 8S9-98). These mouse studies point to a role for both<br><br>
seruxri and srromal produced IGF-1. Thus. in one embodiment the present invention provides a metnod. ot treaüiig a subject in need of such treatment, comprising aömoinistering to the subject an effectrve amount of an antagonist of IGF-1 R as described herein, ^-herein the antagonist inhibits the actvaticm of IGF-1 R by IGF-1. In another embodirnent the subject has Cancer. In another ernbodiment the subject has a mmor. In another ernbodiment, the Cancer is prostate, breast colon or lung Cancer.<br>
It has been observed that bone is the major source of IGF-1 in the body. Thus, in one aspect the present invention provides con^ositioiis and methods for inhfbitmg IGF-1R in a bone of a subject. In one enibodiment an IGF-1R inhibitor of the present invention is acmmstered to a subject that has. or is at risk for developing, a rumor in a bone. The rumor can be, for example, a primary tnmor or a metastatic rumor. The treatrnent optsonally further comprises aidministering to the subject one or more addiüoria] therapeutic andV'or palliative treatmenrs, for example. an anü-rnmor treatment (e~g„ chemotherapy. radiation therapy. or anti-hormone therapy) or a treatment mar inhibits bone tuxnover {e.g., denosumab (Amgen Inc.. Thousand Oaks: CA)}.<br>
IGF-2 is overexpressed in a varieTy of tumors and srromal tissues. IGF-2 levels appear especiaily high (as rauch as 40 fold) in primary liver Cancers (Cariani et al, 1988. Cancer Research 48: 6S44-49) and acenocarcinoma of the colon (Freier et al, 1999. Gut 44: 704-08). Many of the overerowth disorders are associated wirb an increased incidence of childhood tumors. Five to ten percent cf individuals wirb either the prenatal growth disorder Beckwith-Weidmann Syndrome (BWS) or beniihyperplasia develop tumors such as nephroblastoma, adrenal Carcinoma, and neuroblastoma (reviewedby Morison et al., 1998, Molecular Medicine Today 4: 110-05). The turnor-predisposing factor in these children appears to be the mosaic loss of maternal IGF-2 gene imprinting, or duplicarion of the patemal chromosomal arm (1 ip) that carries IGF-2. Both eiterations would mcrease the level of IGF-2 expression. IGF-2 overexpression as a result of mosaic uniparental disomy or loss of IGF-2 ixnprinting has also been detected in Wiims tumors. Growth disorders are not observed in these children even though the IGF-2 gene alterations also occur in some normal tissues, perhaps reflectrng the tissue distribution of the affected cells. Imprinnng of the matemal IGF-2 gene also occurs in mice, and the effects of IGF-2 overexpression are consistent with the human Situation (Cariani et als 1991. Journal of Hepatology 13: 220-26, Schirmacher et al, 1992. Cancer Research 52; 2549-56; Harris er cL 1998, Oncogene 16: 203-09). The incidence of tumors and organomegaly increases in mice that transgenically express excess IGF-2 (Christofori ei al, 1994, Nature 369: 414-18. Ward et al, 1994. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the Unired States of America 91: 10365-9. Wolf et al.. 1994. Endocrrnology 135: 1877-S6, Bates ei al, 1995. British Journal of Cancer 72: 1189-93, Hassan et al, 2000, Cancer Research 60: 1070-76). Local IGF-2 overexpression increases the spontaneous appearance of prostate, rnammary. intestinal, liver and epidermal tumors. Plasma specific expression using liver promoters elevate hepatocellular carcinomas and lyrnphoma. Thus, in one ernbodiment the present invention provides a method of treating a subject in need of such trearment^ comprlsing adrrrinistering to the subject an effective amount of an antagonistof IGF-1 Ras described herein. Tvherein the antagonist inhibits the activation of IGF-1R by IGF-2. La another ernbodiment the subject has cancer. In another ernbodiment the .subject has a tumor. In another ernbodiment the subject has liver cancer. adenocarcinoma of the colon. Beckwith-WeidTpann Syndrome, hernihyperplasia, neohroblastoma. adrenal Carcinoma, neuroblastoma. mosaic loss of maternal IGF-2 gene imprmting. dupHcation of the<br><br>
pateraal chromosomal arm (11p). increased 1GF-2 expression, a minor {e.g.. a prostate, mammary. intestiiial liver. epidermsl. or Vvilms tnmor). organomegaly. hepatocellular Carcinoma, or lymphorna.<br>
In another aspect. the invennon provides methods ofpre vermag or inhibrang a Cancer from srjreadins to another r?ar; ef the bodv. or of treatine: a cancer that has snreac to another part of the bodv. In one tmbodimeni the canrrz aas spread to a regional lyrnph node. In another embodiment, the cancer is metastatic. The nrimary nzrnor can be any krnd of tumor. for example, an adenocarcinoma tumor (e.g.. a prostate adenocarcrnoictt tarnor, a besäst csrcmoma tumor, or a renal cell Carcinoma tumor). a non-smaU ceü or small cell kmg caiaccx tamor, a örynrid cancer tnmor. eic. Tbe site of the metastatic tnmor can be anywberc in the body. h can be. ibr exampk. n bone. the lymph System limg, Drain, eye. skin. pancrease, or liver. In ose paröctnax embc<iimcnt a sufo>ect bavmg a tumor disease is rreated witii an effective arnormt of an IGF- 1R inblnrniig ■-^mncmnp of tbe niesen: invennon such that the primary tumor is prevemed trom meiastasiziiig. In ancthex piarticmar enjbcKhmsnL. a subject having a primary tumor is treated with an effective sroouni of an 1GF-1R rnmrnrmg cöraDcsinon of the present rnvenuon such trist the primary tnmor is iniubited fron metastasizing. In another parncujar embodiment a subject having a metastatic tumor is treated with an effective amoum of an IGF-1R mbfDrrins cornoosition of die present invention such mar growth or spreadrng of the secondarv- tumor is irmibrted. In another particular embodiment a subject having a metastatic rumor is treated wirb an enective amotmt of an IGF-1R inhibiting composition of the present invention such mal the secandary tnmor is rednced in size. In a more particular embodiment, the primary tnmor is an adenocarcinoina tnmor. a non-small cell lung tumor. a small cell hing tumor. or a thyroid cancer. In another more particular embodiment the metastatic tumor is in a hone. In another more particular embodiment. a metastatic tnmor is prevented or inhibited from forming in a bone. In another more particulany definec embodiment the method comprises ueating the subject with an IGF-1R rnhfbiting composition offne present invention and ose or more other treatments (e.g., a treatment that kills ar inhibits the growth of cancer eells, such as radiahorL hormonal therapy. or chemotherapy, or a treatment that inhibits the turnc-ver cf bone, such as denosumab). non-limiting examples of which are provided herein. The one or mcre other rrsatments can incinde. for example the Standard of care for the subject"s particular condition and'or palliative care.<br>
With out being boimd to any particular theory. mmor cells appear to depend on the PI3 Kinase/Alct signaling pathway to resist the apoptosis-inducing acrivity of cbemctherapetrücs. radiation. and anti-hormone therany. Thus, in one embodimem, the present invention provides methods of treating a subject in need of such treatmeni comprising admioistering to the subject an IGF-1R antagonist of the present invention and a chemotherapeutic, radiation- and/or an anti-hoimone therapy. This concept has been vaiidated experimentally in cell culture rnodels and rodent tumor models by anüsense and dominant negative mutations (reviewed by Baserga er cl.. 1997. Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1332: Fl 05-26, Baserga. 2ÖO0&gt; Oncogene 19: 5574-S1). Ln one embodiment the chemotherapeuric agents is selected from the group consisting of rnitotic mhibitors. alkylating agents. anti-metabolites. intercalating antibiotics, grcwth facior Inhibitors, cell cycle inhfoitors, enz'v^mes. topoisomerase inhibirors. anti-survival agents. biological response modifiers. anti-bormones. e.g. anti-androgens, and acti-angiogenesis agents.<br>
One example of a chcmotherapeutic agent that can be sdministered in combination with an IGF-I receptor inhibitor of the invention is CPT-11. CPT-11 (lrinotecan hydorchloride trihydrate) is a serni<br><br>
synthetic, water soluble derivative of carnptothechx a plant alkaloicl CPT-11 and an associated metabolite called SN38 inhibit topoisomerase 1 (TOPOl). This enzyme nrrodnces reversible single-strand breaks in DNA that allow unv,±nding and permit DNA repheation to preeeed. Inhibition of TOPOl pxevents religation of single-strand breaks aüer DNA. replication izsuhzzg in greaily increased chromosoma] fragmentation. This DNA damage premotes cell death by zpoptosis through the action of p53 and other Systems that monitor genome integrity. The cytotoxic effec: of CPT-11 is gencrally limited to cells that are replicatmg DNA (S-Phase). QuiesceTit cells are largely iwaSsctsd.<br>

Sporadic mutabons that inacrrvaie die PEIN gene product occux relatxvely ireqoenäy in most human Cancers (Yamada er al., 2001. J Cell Sei 114:2375-82, Hill ei al., 2002, Pbarroacol Sbeiapeat 93:243-51). Löss of PTEN causes the Akt phosphoryiated State to persist through loss ofrbeabürry to down-regulate stiirnalaiory signals orignastiag from 1GF-1R and other sotrrces. Tbe Status of tbe D53 tumor suppressor also rnüuences rbe acüvhy of tbe IGF-1R signaling System. In rbe ground Stare, the basal or consdtuiive transerrprion of IGF-1R is repressed by p53 via an indirect mechanism. Acrjvabonof Akt prornotes rbe pbospborylation cf rrxlrnl. which tben hinös ibe p53 tumor suppressor and prornotes its degradaüon (Mayo er al, 2002, TI3S 27:462-67), resuiting in increased 1GF-1R expression. A similar outcome is observed when p53 is inactivated by mutation. When transiently expressed in Saos-2 (a human osteosarcoma cell line) and RD (a rbabdomyosarcoma cell line). wild-type p53 is able to suppress ihe acüvity of a cotransfectec IGF-lRpromoter construet wbereas tumor-derived. mutant versions of p53 bave no effect. It has been proposed that the increased level of IGF-1R promotes tbe resistance to apoptosis associated wirb p53 loss in maiignant cells (Werner et al, 2000. Cell Mol Life Sei 57:932-42). Taus, in one embodiment the present invention provides a method of treating a cancerous condition in a subjeet in need of such treatment comprising administsring to the subjeet an effective amount of an 1GF-1R antagonist as described herein, wherein the cancerous condition is characterized by ceüs that bave a reduced expression or acüvity of p53.<br>
The WT1 (Vviins kidney fomor suppressor 1 protein) also has been shown to bind and repress the IGF-1R promoter. Thus. in one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of treating a cancerous condiuon in a subjeet in need of such treatment cornprising administering to ihe subjeet an effective amount of an IGF-1R antagonist as described herein wherein the cancerous condition is characterized by a reduced expression or activity of WT1.<br>
The proliferation cf ncrmal Sbroblasts has been shown to require. under denned culture condiriens, the combined acücn of IGF and a stromal growth factor (e.g. PDGF. EGF) to rarnp-up Ras/Raf'Map Kinase and promote cell cycle entry (tbe G0 to Gl transition). Ffbroblasts derived ürom IGF-]R (-'-) mice do not respond to growth factor alone. or most oncogenes (e.g. oncogexdc Ras) that activate the Ras/Raf/Map Kinase pathway. Thus. in one embodiment tbe present invention provides a method of treating a subjeet in need of such treatment comprising administering to the subjeet an IGF-1R antagonist as described herein and an agent tbat targets a growth factor and/or a growth factor reeeptor, such as a growth factor reeeptor tyrosine kmase, e.g., the EGFR, HER~2; ber-abh VEGFFL Kit, ral mTOR, CDKl/2: VEGFR2.

The role of IGF-1R in hematological malignancies has been reviewed by (No\*ak et ah, 2003. insuiin-Like Growth Factors and Hematological Malignxmcies in Insulin-Like Growth Factors, LeRoitn et al. ed.s. Landes Bioscience). A functiona] role for die IGF-1R in herotopoietic maügnancies is demorostraied by. for example. the abüity of IGF-1R monoclonal antibodies to block transformed cell growth in cultnre. IGF-I has been found to enhance growth of freshly isolated human acute myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukerrha blasts. Wirb respect to T cell malignancies. IGF-I bas been shown to inihience the growth of murine lympboma cells bearing a pre-T cell pheootype and. immaüire and rnatizre primary human T lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia ceils were found to express high numbers of IGF-1R. Tlius. in one embodirnent the present invention provides methods of trear'ng E hematological rnalignancy in 2 subject in need thereof comprising administering to the subject an anragonist of 1GF-1R as described herein. In anothex embodirnent, the rnalignancy is an acute myelogenous leukemia. an acute lymphoblastic leukemia. or a T cell rnalignancy.<br>
In another aspect the presem invention provides methods of identirying subjects who are more likely to benent from treatrnent using the compositions and/or methods of treatment of the present invention. Such methods can enable a earegiver to better tailor a therapeutic regimen to a parücukr subiect's needs and reduce the likelihood of an ineffective or counterproducüve course of treatrnent. In one embodirnent, the present invention provides a method of determining whether a subject is a candidate for treatment using a corrxposition or method as described herein comprising detennining whether a target cell type in the subject expresses IGF-1R. wherein if the target cell type expresses IGF-1R, thenthe subject is a candidate for treatment In another embodirnent. the method cornprises deteronning the approximate average number of IGF-IRmolecules per target cell, wherein 10". 10"". 10". 10\ or 106 IGF-1R per cell indicates that the subject is a candidate for treatment. The approximate average number of IGF-1R moiecules per target cell can be deteimined using any technique known in the art, for example, by staining a sample comprising cells of the target cell type wiih an IGF-1R bindmg molecule, and detecting the amount of IGF-lRbinding molecule bound to the sample, where the amount of IGF-1R binding molecule detected is proportional to the average number of IGF-1R moiecules in the sample. In another embodirnent the method cornprises cornparing the approximate average number of IGF-1R moiecules per target cell to a reference Standard- wherein if the aporoximate average number of IGF-1R moiecules per target cell is greater than the reference Standard, then the subject is more ükeiy to beneüt from treatment using the compositions and/or methods of treatment of the present invention- In another embodirnent the target cell type is a cancerous cell type, In another embodirnent, the target cell type is a colon Cancer cell type, a breast cancer cell type, anNSCLC cell type, or a lenkende cell type.<br>
In another embodirnent a subject who is a candidate for treatment is identified by detecting IGF-1 anoVor IGF-2 in the target cell type, or in the Stratum of the target cell type. In another embodirnent, the<br><br>
target cell type is a cancerous cell type. In another embodiment the target cell type is a coion Cancer cell type, a breast cancer cell type, an KSCLC cell type, or a leiikemic cell type.<br>
In another embodiment a subject who is H candidate for treatment is identfied by detecting activiiy of IGF-lR-mediated signaling in the target cell type, wherein IGF-lR-mediated signaling in the target cell type intiicstes that the subject is a candidate for treatment. Examples of molecules that can be mcnrrtored for lGF-lP.-dependent changes are shown in Figure 10, such as molecules in the PB/Akt patirway, e.g., IGF-1IL IRS adapters, Akt exe. Such molecules can be irxraitored for, for example, a change in ohosohoTylaikjn ^nr; eg., an increase in phosphorylation. Phosphospecific antibodies that recognize rhe activasd fanrs of diese proteia markers are highly developed, and these reagenrs have nroven to be reüabie for rrnmnnobks detection in expeiimental Systems.<br>
The compcsiikjas and/or metbods of the present invenrion also cari be used. for example, in cosmenc rearmesrrs. m Terexmaxy treafments. to increase longevity. to treat reprodnetive defects. and to rear a vanery of giuv..! related disorders.<br>
Taerapeciic methods and adnTmistration of antigen binding proteins<br>
Certain rnethods provided herein comprise adminisrering an IGF-1R binding antigen binding protein ;o a subject thereby reducing an IGF-1-induced biologicai response thai plays a role in a particular condition. In partic^iaT embodiraents, methods of the invenrion involve contacting endogenous IGF-1R tvith an IGF-1R binding antigen binding protein. e.g.. via administration to a subject or in an ex vivo procedura.<br>
The term "Treatrnenf' encompasses alleviation orprevention of at least one Symptom or other aspect of i disorder. er reduetion of disease severity, and the like. An antigen binding protein need not effeci a complete eure, or eradicate every symptom or manifestation of a disease. to constitute a viable rherat?eutic aeent  As is recognized in the pertinent field. drugs employed as thexapeuric agents rnay reduce the severity of a given disease State, but need not abolish every manifestation of the disease to be regarded as usefoi merapeuik agents.  Similarly. a prophylacrically atiministered treatment need not be completely efiective in preventmg the onset of a condition in order to constitute a viable prophylactic agent  Simply reduemg the impact of a disease (for example. by reducing the number or severity of its Symptoms, or by increasing the erTectiveness of another treatment or by producing another beneficial eneci). or reducing the Likelihooc that the disease will oeeur or morsen in a subject is sufScient One embodiment of the invention is directed to a method comprising aohninistermg to s patient an IGF-1R antagonist in an amount and for a time suffkient to ineuce a sustained improvement over baseline of an indicator that refjects the severity of the particular disorder.<br>
As is understood in the pertinent neld, pharmaceuticai coinpositions comprising the molecules of . the mvention are atiministered to a subject in a manner appropriate to the indication.

EXAMPLE 13: -Antibody Binding :o Celi-Snrface IGF-IR<br>
This example provides a method for detecting the binding of an anti-IGF-IR antibody to cell-surface expressed IGF-IR<br>
The ability of antibodies TQ1 IC. TQ25. TQ58. and TQ59 to bind to human IGF-IR displayed on ihe cell surface was evaluated using Balb/C 3T3 fibroblasts and MCF-7 human breast cance: cells engineered to overexoress the human IGF-IR reeeptor at a level of —3-4 x 10"' moiecules t&gt;er cell. A Balb/C 3T3 cell line that stahly overexpresses the human IGF-IR (~ 3 xlO5 reeeptors per cell) was derived using ^"ith a retre viral vector essentially as described by Pietrzkowski et al. 1992. Cell Gro*-vth Differentiation 3:199-205. MCF-7 breast cancer cells that cveiproduce huiGF-1R were transfected with apcDNA3.1 exrression vector (Tnvi trogen Corp.}. Zeocin resistant cells that express a high level of hu IGF-IR (—4 x<br><br>
105 receptors per cell) were expanced aner selection by FACS using anti-IG?-" R monoclonal artibodv aIR3 and an PE-labeled goat anti murine IgG antibody (Caltag Laboratories. Bvrrirrigarne, CA). The process of selection and expansion was repeated four times.<br>
IGF-1R Receptor antibody staining and receptor expression was rrornhored by ?ACS as feile ~_s: rhe cells were released froin T175 üasks (Coming) by washing 2 times with ex^ss ?3S (Ca/Mg free.; foliowed by treatment with 5 ml of Cell Dissociation Buffer (Sigxna) for 10 rrrm zi racm tenperature. The cells were collected by centrifugaticra and washed two times by res~ospendnig thss tn PBS aüti c^ntriiagation. For primary antibody staining. 1 ug of antibody was added TO 10* celh resasDendeti in 100 ul PBS plus 0.5% BSA (BPBS) and ine cells were incubated at 4C C for 1.5 irr.

The peak fluorescent intensity of anti-IGF-lR antibody labeling of the TGF-I3. cverexpressors was increased 10-20 fold relative to parental BaFo/'C 3T3 arjd MCF-7 cells for each of the t^sted antibodies. Tkis is the result predicted for an antibody iba: speciücally binds JGF-1R. Backgrounc fluorescence of cells tre2ted wirb no antibodies or FITC-Iaheled secondary alone were insignificant.<br>
EXAMPLE 34: Inhibition of IGF-1R<br>
This example presents methods of detecring Inhibition of IGF-1R by anti-IGF-lR antibodies.<br>
32D huIGF-IR-IRS-1 Cell Inhibition<br>
Murine 32D cells that ccexpress the human IGF-1R receptor (20K per cell) and bunzan IRS-1 have nroven 10 be a affective System tc exarnine the molecular components 1GF-IR siinabng Valentinis er -JL. 1999. J Bio! Chem 274:12423-30. Normal 32D cells express relative]}- low levels of rhe murine crthoiogs of these two gene prcducts.  32D cell normally required 1L3 for growth and surv;\ al.  IGF-I or IGF-2 ean replace IL3 in 32D huIGF-JR-tIRS-I cells as showr. in Figure 16, panel A.  Tnt EC-- :c 'he IGF-1 d:^se response curve was abcut 0.5 n.M. wbereas the IGF-2 EC50 (2.8 nM) is about six fold higher retlecting weaker cfüniiy of IGF-2 for IGF-1 R. To assess the ability 01 rhe antibodies TQ1 IC. TQ25; TQ5E; and TQ59 to block IGF-1 or IGF-2 Stimulation. 96-well micrctitre plates were seeded with 3Q:öö0 22D hu IGF-1R-MRS-1 cells per well in a volurne of 200 ul of RPMI (Gibco/BRL) containing 5% fetal bovine semm (Gibco'BRL) and Ix penicillin. strepromvcin. glutamine (Gihoco/BRL) and increasmg concenL-aricT- of antibody (10"l2M io lO'^f) or 30 antibody.  IGF-1 (2 nM). IGF-2 (S ruvl) or noih-ing was added aftt;r 1 'r,r preincubation with antibody, "li-thyrnidine (1 uCi per well) was added at 27 hr nosi-annbod}' Eddition. The cells were harvesteü 21 hr later, and incorporation of "H- rh\Tnidine into DNA was deterrnincd fcr each<br><br>
sample. The assays were performed in triplicate. An anti-CD20 antibody was used as a negative control. Each of anfcbodies TQ!*C TQ25: TQ5S: and TQ59 was abie to completely block the IGF-1 and IGF-2 mediated Stimulation of the 32D cells. The reduction of background proliferation in ihe absence of added IGF-1 and IGF-2 is dae to the irthibhion of senim IGF-1 and IGF-2. The binding data were analyzed using GraphPad PRIZM™ Software. The data are shown in Figure 16.<br>

IGF-1 greatly stirnulates tne mccrporarjon of ""H-thymddine by senrm-starved cuteres ofxoouse embryonic fibroblasts (Balb/C 3T3 or NTH 3T3) that cversxpress IGF-1R (-1 x 10ö IGFlRper etil). Kate et al. 1993, J Biol Chem 268:2655-61; Pienzkowsjd et d... 1992, Cell Growth Difereiriaticii 3:199-205. This phenornenon is recaprtuiaied withboth IGF-1 and IGF-2 in a Balb/C 3T3 cell line hn IGF-1R overexpressor. Both growth factors srrmnlaföd ^H-thyuddine incorporadon by aboia 20-fold. The EG* rf the IGF-1 dose response curve was aboui Ö.7 nM. vsiiereas the IGF-2 ECv, (4.4 nM) is sevenfoie higher. indicating a weaker aföniry of IGF-2 fer IGF-1R. To ass&amp;ss the ability of a given antibody io block IGF-1 or IGF-2 Stimulation, 96-well rrhcroütre plates were seeaed with 1Q.OÖ0 cells per weil in a volume of 200 ui of DMEM (Gfbco/BRL) containing 10% calf seram (GIbco/BRL) and 1 x penicillio. streptomyciiL glutarnine (Giboco/BRL). After ovemight ineubation wben the cells were about 80% confluent the growth medium was replaced with 100 UJ DMEM contaimng 0.1% BSA after wasbing once with 200 ul PBS. Antibodies at increasing concentrations (10_1"M ic 10"6 VI), orno antibody, were added at 24 hr post-semm starvation.  IGF-1 (2 nM). IGF-2 (S nM) and 3H-thyrnindine Q uCi per well) were. added after a 1 hr   ■ preineubation with antibody. The cells were harvested 24 hr later. and incorporatien of "TI- th\Tricine info DNA was deterrnined for each sample. "The assays were performed in triplicate. Each tested antibody was able to completely block fhe IGF-1 and IGF-2 mediated Stimulation of Balb/C 3T3 cells: as shown in Figure 17.
