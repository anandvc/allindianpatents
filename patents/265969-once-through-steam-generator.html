				<td>Description<br>
Once-through steam generator<br>
The invention relates to a once-through steam generator with a vertical gas pass, which is formed by gas-tight tube walls whose tubes are arranged helically or spirally at a lower part of the gas pass, at which burners for fossil fuels are located, and vertically at an upper part of the gas pass, and the lower part of which is bounded at the lower end by a bottom of the gas pass and the upper part of which is bounded at the upper end by a transverse wall of the gas pass, by a convergent cross section of the gas pass formed by the tube walls or by a lower edge of heating surfaces arranged inside the gas pass.<br>
Such a generic once-through steam generator is known from publication ,,Kraftwerkstechnik", Springer-Verlag, 2nd edition 1994, section 4.4.2.4-Forced once-through (pages 171 to 174), Prof. Dr.-lng. Karl StrauB, which is used in power stations for the generation of electrical energy by the burning of fossil fuels, for example. In the case of a once-through or forced once-through steam generator, the heating of the evaporator tubes forming the combustion chamber or the gas pass leads - in contrast with the natural-circulation or forced-circulation steam generator with only partial vaporisation of the water-vapour mixture conveyed in the circulation -to a vaporisation of the flow or working medium in the evaporator tubes in a single once-through. The evaporator tubes forming the gas pass can be arranged vertically or helically/ spirally and thus ascending in an inclined fashion.<br>
The design of the lower part of the gas pass and thus of the inclined tubing of the once-through steam generator with plain tubes, i.e. with evaporator tubes which have a plain surface on the inside, is determined by the minimum forced once-through load and the mass flow density required for adequate cooling. With the forced once-through minimum loads of ≤ 30 % of the full load that are required nowadays, correspondingly high mass flow densities (linear dependence between load range and mass flow density in the pure once-through operation) and associated raised pressure losses in the steam generator necessarily arise with full load, which have to be compensated for by additional operating costs of the steam generator. With the design of the lower part of the once-through steam-generator gas pass alternatively with vertically tubed gas-pass walls, a design for forced<br>
V:\PAVAPB_259_S04-006-0 Translation engl korrigierte Fassung.docV*\PA\APB_259_S04-006-0_Translotfon engl_Korrokturfassung.doc<br>
once-through minimum loads of 
Vertically tubed gas-pass walls are however bound up with the drawback that local heating differences in the combustion chamber, or more precisely in the gas pass, are not adequately compensated for. Even with the use of an additional costly mixing system for the evaporator of the once-through steam generator or with entry flow restrictors at the tube entrances of the evaporator of the once-through steam generator, the system - compared with helically or inclined ascending evaporator tubes in the gas-pass walls - is much more susceptible to heating asymmetries in respect of the temperature profile of the water/vapour working medium at the exit of the evaporator of the once-through steam generator.<br>
Publication EP 0 349 834 Al makes known a once-through steam generator with helically or spirally tubed combustion-chamber or gas-pass walls of the lower part of the gas pass and with vertically tubed gas-pass walls of the upper part of the gas pass, whereby the spirally tubed gas pass wall is formed with plain tubes and the vertically tubed gas pass wall is formed with internally ribbed tubes. Minimum once-through loads of ≤ 30% of the full load are only possible in a once-through steam generator designed in this way if a sufficiently high mass flow density of the water/vapour working medium is selected for the evaporator tubes of the gas-pass walls in the spirally tubed region. The consequence of this is an increased power requirement of the feed-water pump and thus a disadvantageous reduction in the overall plant efficiency.<br>
Publication DE 195 10 033 C 2 makes known a further once-through steam generator with helically or spirally tubed combustion-chamber or gas-pass walls of the lower part of the gas pass and vertically tubed gas-pass walls of the upper part of the gas pass. With this known once-through steam generator, the enclosing or containing walls of the combustion chamber or gas pass are divided, viewed from bottom to top, into a bottom section, a first and a second intermediate section and an upper section, whereby the upper section can<br>
V:\PA\APB_Z59_S04-006-0_Translation engl_korrigierte Fassung.docV!\PA\APB_259_S04-006-0_Tronstat ion cngl  Korrokturfassung.doc<br>
again be divided into a first and a second part. The bottom section, the first and the second intermediate section and, as the case may be, the first part of the upper section can have spiral tube walls.  In order to be able to operate this once-through steam generator with low loads, it is proposed to design the bottom section with internally plain tubes, the first intermediate section with internally multiple lead ribbed tubes (MLR: multiple lead ribbed), the second intermediate section with internally single lead ribbed tubes (SLR: single lead ribbed) and the upper section again with internally plain tubes or the first part of the upper section once again with internally multiple lead ribbed tubes.   With this arrangement of differently designed evaporator tubes, it has proved to be a drawback that internally single lead ribbed tubes (SLR), compared with internally multiple lead ribbed tubes (MLR), generate a higher pressure loss on the working medium side on account of a raised flow resistance, said pressure loss generating additional operating costs of the plant and reducing the overall efficiency of the power station in which in the once-through steam generator is used. A further drawback results from the increased assembly expenditure which arises for the connection of the MLR tubes with the SLR tubes and, as the case may be, the latter once again with MLR tubes, as well as the additional cost arising due to the use and furnishing of evaporator tubes of different kinds.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a once-through steam generator wherein the aforementioned drawbacks are avoided/ and to propose the design of a evaporator system for a fossil-fuelled once-through steam generator with inclined tubed enclosing walls of the lower part of the steam-generator gas pass for a forced once-through minimum load of ≤ 30 % of the full load with minimised pressure loss in the steam generator and adequate cooling of the gas-pass enclosing tube walls in the overall load range with as homogeneous a working-medium temperature profile as possible at the exit of the once-through steam generator.<br>
The aforementioned object is solved by the characterising features of claim 1. Advantageous embodiments of the invention can be found in the sub-claims.<br>
V:\PA\APB_259^S04-006-0_Transiatipn engl   korrigierte Fassung.docV! \PA\APB_259_S04-006-0_TransIat ion engl_KorrckturfaGsung.doc<br>
An optimally designed once-through steam generator exhibiting the following advantages is obtained with the solution according to the invention:<br>
-	Exclusive use of internally multiple lead ribbed evaporator tubes (MLR) in a helical or<br>
screw-thread fashion in the region in which internally ribbed tubes are used, and<br>
thus the furnishing solely of this one internally ribbed tube type,<br>
-	Minimisation of the pressure loss on the medium side by optimum distribution of<br>
internally plain and internally ribbed evaporator tubes in the region of the lower part<br>
of the gas pass,<br>
-	Adequate cooling of the evaporator tubes in the whole load range also in the case of<br>
a forced once-through minimum load with the use of internally multiple lead ribbed<br>
evaporator tubes (MLR),<br>
-	Lowering of the forced once-through minimum load to ≤ 30 % of the full load or<br>
boiler maximum continuous rate (BMCR) with minimal pressure losses,<br>
-	Taking account of the positive characteristic of the inclined tubing with regard to the<br>
temperature profile of the medium at the exit of the once-through steam generator in<br>
all heating states with the optimum number of windings,<br>
-	Improvement of the stability and sensitivity of the evaporator system with regard to<br>
heating differences by the optimum distribution of the free or clear tube cross-section<br>
of the enclosing wall tubes of the lower part of the gas pass, viewed in the flow<br>
direction of the working medium.<br>
An advantageous embodiment makes provision such that gradient angle a of the inclined ascending or helically or spirally running evaporator tubes surrounding the lower part of the gas pass is designed at 15° to 35° to the horizontal.<br>
It is advantageous to design the tubes of the bottom of the gas pass internally plain. In this way, the pressure loss inside these tubes can be kept small and, consequently, a working-medium temperature asymmetry in this region can largely be avoided.<br>
A further advantageous embodiment makes provision such that the tubes of the tube wall of the upper part of the gas pass are designed internally plain. Compared with internally<br>
V:\PA\APB_259_S04-Q06-0_Translation engl_korrj_gjerte_J^s_sung..docV8\PA\APB_259_S04-006-0_TrQnGlation ongl_Korrekturfassung.docribbed tubes, the pressure loss in the tubes can thus be reduced and savings made on capital costs.<br>
A changing heat-flow density profile over the height of the combustion chamber or gas pass is characteristic of a fossil-fuelled steam generator. For once-through steam generators, a vapour temperature changing over the combustion chamber or gas pass height typically arises in the evaporator tubes of the tube walls. In order to take account of the influence of the heat-flow density profile changing over the combustion chamber or gas pass height and the vapour temperature in the tube walls also changing over the height, and to achieve working-medium pressure losses of essentially equal magnitude inside the wall tubes, it is advantageous for there to be an essentially horizontal design of the dividing point of the tube walls between the lower and the upper part of the gas pass and/or the dividing point(s) of the tube walls inside the lower part of the gas pass between the lower tube-wall section and the tube-wall section that is immediately adjacent to the lower tube-wall section and any further tube wall section that may be present.<br>
Examples of embodiment of the invention are explained in greater detail below with the aid of the drawing and the description.<br>

Fig. 8 shows a cross-section through an internally ribbed tube,<br>
Fig. 9 shows a longitudinal section through an internally ribbed tube.<br>
In fossil-fuelled once-through steam generators 1 of conventional power stations, the working medium, usually water/vapour, is as is known preheated, vaporised, superheated and, after partial pressure-relief in the HP part of the steam turbine, possibly reheated essentially in one pass or once-through of a steam turbine circuit. Once-through steam generator 1 is described below.<br>
Figure 1 shows diagrammatically a once-through steam generator 1 with a vertical gas pass 2, which is formed by gas-tight tube walls 3. Tube walls 3 surround a gas pass 2, which preferably has a rectangular cross-section with a width B and a depth T, whereby front and rear walls 20, 21 of gas pass 2, for example, extend over width B and right-hand and left-hand side walls 22, 23 of gas pass 2 extend over depth T, see also figure 2 in this regard.<br>
Gas pass 2 is divided into a lower and an upper part 4, 5. The division between lower and upper parts 4, 5, or more precisely dividing point 14 of tube walls 3 which surround lower and upper parts 4, 5 of gas pass 2, preferably runs essentially horizontally with respect to the course of the tubes. This can also include a dividing point 14 designed in a slightly sawtooth manner, since the tubes running in an ascending manner can be preassembled and put together into tube panels (not shown) and can be designed in a sawtooth manner at dividing point 14. Lower part 4 of gas pass 2 is formed by tube walls 3, tubes 11,12<br>
V:\PA\APB_259_S04-006-0_Translation engl._korrigierte Fassung.docV! \PA\APB_259_S04-006-0_Translation engl_KorrckturfasGung.doc<br>
whereof enclose gas pass 2 in a helical or spiral manner and ascend inclined at an angle a to the horizontal (see figures 1 and 2, whereby only a couple of tubes of gas-tight tube wall 3 running in an inclined fashion are shown diagrammatically), whereas tubes 13 of tube walls 3 of upper part 5 of gas pass 2 run vertically. For the burning of fossil fuels, pulverised coal for example, inside gas pass or combustion chamber 2, burners (not shown) are located in lower part 4 of gas pass 2. The combustion waste gas or flue gas arising during the combustion of the fossil fuel flows upwards inside gas pass 2 and is then conducted away through further gas passes (not shown). The heat released during the combustion is given off to the aforementioned water/vapour working medium of once-through steam generator 1.<br>
In the present example of embodiment, the lower end of lower part 4 of gas pass 2 is bounded by a hopper-shaped bottom 6 and the upper end of upper part 5 of gas pass 2 is bounded by a transverse wall 7. Hopper-shaped and gas-tight bottom 6, which can have one or more ash discharge openings 24 for the removal of ash arising during the combustion of the fossil fuel, has a partial height H0 and evaporator tubes 10 forming bottom 6 run helically or spirally like evaporator tubes 11, 12 of lower part 4 of gas pass 2. Transverse wall 7 is preferably a gas-tight tube wall such as for example tube wall 3. Upper part 5 of gas pass 2 can alternatively be bounded at the upper end of gas pass 2 by a convergent cross section 25 of gas pass 2 formed by tube walls according to figure 6 or by a lower edge of heating surfaces 26 arranged inside gas pass 2 according to figure 7.<br>
Total height Hges of lower part 4 of gas pass 2, i.e. the part of gas pass 2 whose tube walls 3 are formed by helically or spirally running tubes 11, 12, is designed according to the relationship<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
whereby B and T represent the width and the depth of gas pass 2 and angle a the gradient of each tube 11, 12 ascending in an inclined fashion, i.e. running helically or spirally, inside tube wall 3. Figure 2 thus represents a developed view of a tube 11,12 inside lower<br>

part 4 of gas pass 2 as viewed from inside, i.e. from gas pass 2.  The respective proportions of the dimensions of Hges/ B and T of the aforementioned relationship are given in metres.<br>
Furthermore, tube walls 3 of lower part 4 of gas pass 2 are divided into a lower and at least one further tube-wall section 8, 9, whereby tubes  11  of lower tube-wall section 8 are internally plain (plain tubes) and tubes 12 of tube-wall section 9 directly adjacent to lower tube-wall section 8 are internally multiple lead ribbed with ribs 16 in a helical or screw-thread fashion, see figures 8 and 9.   Lower tube-wall section 8 has a partial height H, of total height Hges and tube-wall section 9 directly adjacent to lower tube-wall section 8 has a partial height H2 of total height Hges. Directly adjacent means that tube-wall section 9, viewed in the vertical direction, lies directly above lower tube-wall section 8.  The division of tube-wall sections 8, 9, or more precisely dividing point 15 between the latter, and of any further tube-wall sections (not shown) in respect of different tube designs or types within lower part 4 of gas pass 2 preferably runs essentially horizontally.   This can also include here a dividing point 15 designed in a slightly sawtooth manner, since the tubes running in an ascending manner can be preassembled and put together into tube panels (not shown) and can be designed in a sawtooth manner at dividing point 15.<br>
Partial height H, of lower tube-wall section 8 is designed with respect to total height Hges of lower part 4 of gas pass 2 according to the relationship.<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
and partial height H2 of tube-wall section 9 directly adiacent to lower tube-wall section 8 is designed with respect to total height Hges of lower part 4 of gas pass 2 according to the relationship<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
whereby the respective heights are given in m.<br>

The respective tube internal cross-sections are designed according to the relationship<br>

whereby the internal cross-sections are given in m2.<br>
Tubes 10 of bottom 6 are preferably designed internally plain (plain tubes).
