				<td>The present invention relates to an improved culture medium for regeneration of transgenic secondary embryos of Coffea Canephora.P.ex.Fr The   invention   is   aimed   at   development   of   improved   culture   media   for regeneration of plants through secondary embryos from transgenic tissue to obtain complete plantlets.<br>
Coffea is an extremely important perennial agricultural crop in tropical areas with more than 6.5 million tons of green beans produced every year on about 11 million hectares . The genus Coffea (Rubiaceae) consists of about 80 species in which only Coffea arabica (arabica) and Coffea canephora (robusta ) are important for the production of Coffee beans . C.arabica contributes nearly 70% of coffee consumed world wide due to its superior quality and C.canephora accounts for the rest 30% The most economically important species are Coffee arabica (2n-44) and C. canephora (2n-22). C. canephora, used for instant coffee powder products, is a cross-pollinated specis and more resistant to pest and diseases compared to C.arabica but has low production quality. Conventional breeding of coffee is difficult because of the long duration of cultivation to set seeds. Molecular breeding, therefore, is a desirable technique for the genetic improvement of coffee species. Plant regeneration through in vitro tissue culture is a basic system for achieving genetic transformation, and there have been many reports involving somatic embryogenesis in coffee plants. Plant regeneration via various tissue culture methods should be very effective for propagation and improvement of coffee plants (Staritsky G 1970, Embryoid<br><br>
formation in callus tissues of Coffee. Acta Botanica. Neerl. 18: 509-514, Sondahl MR , Sharp WR 1977 High frequency induction of somatic embryos in cultured leaf explants of Coffea arabica L. Z.Pflanzenphysiology 81395-408., Yasuda T, Fujii Y.Yamaguchi T 1985, Embryogenic callus induction from Coffea arabica leaf explants by benzyladenine. Plant &amp; Cell Physiology 26: 595-597., Hatanaka T, Arawaka O, Yasuda T, Uchida N, Yamaguch T 1991, Effect of plant growth regulators on somatic embryogenesis in leaf cultures of Coffea canephora. Plant Cell Rep 10: 179-182.Hatanaka T, Choi YE, Kusano T , Sano H 1999). Somatic embryogenesis and secondary embryogenesis from primary somatic embryo is a highly useful method for a large-scale propagation and for genetic transformation of species of economic interest. Somatic embryos are widely considered to be of single cell origin, hence is advantageous for transformation studies. Moreover, the process of somatic embryogenesis offers a mean to propagate large number of transgenic plants over a short period of time. In spite of many reports on somatic embryogenesis of Coffea, the induction of somatic embryogenesis and plantlets formation are not applicable easily to get plants from genetic transformation of coffee. References may be made to Barton et al. (1991) who obtained transformants from electroporated protoplasts of C. arabica.The drawbacks are cultured protoplasts did not develop into whole plants. Van Boxtel et al. (1995) reported expression of GUS genes on the surfaces of coffee leaf tissues following biolistic delivery. The drawbacks are it includes only transient expression and not stable integration of the transgene. No<br><br>
regenerated plants were obtained. Sugiama et al (1995) reported transformation of Coffee with Agrobacterium rhizogenes . The drawback is it consists of mobilization of only the rol genes by transformation and does not include mobilization of transgenes using a binary vector in Agrobacterium rtiizogenes. A method for producing a transformant of Coffea arabica, by infecting an embryogenic callus of Coffea arabica with Agrobacterium tumefaciens EHA101 strain that comprises of a vector containing an exogenous gene and a gene available for the selection of transformed embryonic callus to produce a transformed embryogenic callus in a medium containing N.6-[2-isopentenyl]-adenosine and selecting transformed embryonic callus, and producing transgenic somatic embryo thereby regenerating a transformed Coffea arabica by Sano et al United States Patent: 6,392,125. The drawback is it consists of transforming the callus which leads to somaclonal variations in the transformed lines and do not include direct regeneration. So there is a need to develop efficient regeneration protocol which does not involve an intermediate callusing phase. Regeneration by inducing secondary embyogenesis directly from the primary embryo after a transformation event is very much useful in quick regeneration of transformants from primary embryos of Coffea caneptiora.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide an improved culture medium for regeneration of transgenic secondary embryos of Coffea Caneptiora.P.ex.Fr. which obviates the drawback as detailed above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to develop improved culture<br><br>

In an embodiment of the present invention regeneration of transgenic Coffea canephora plantlets obtained by inducing secondary embryogenesis from primary somatic embryos after transforming with Agrobacterium sp. harboring a binary vector with selection marker as hygromycine on improved MS medium supplemented with growth regulators and selection marker.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the transgenic secondary embryos obtained from primary somatic embryos after transforming with Agrobactehum sp. harboring a binary vector with selection maker as hygromycin may be further cultured on improved plantlet regeneration (embryo germination) medium to get regenerated plantlets expressing the transgene.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention an improved<br><br>
media may be used for regeneration of transgenic plants from<br>
primary somatic embryos comprises: The novelty of the present invention is it provides for the first time an improved culture media for regeneration of plants by secondary embryogenesis from primary somatic embryos of Coffea canephora after transformation using Agrobacterium sp. harboring a binary vector with a marker gene for the selection of transgenic secondary embryos . This is potentially very useful in plant biotechnology for micro propagation and for rapid selection of transformants in Coffea canephora.<br>
In the present invention : Leaf explants of coffee {Coffea canephora ) were prepared from leaves of In vitro germinated seedlings according to the method previously described (Hatanaka et al. 1991). The leaf explants were cultured on primary embryogenic media according to the method previously described (Van Boxtel and Berthouly 1996) After 4 months of the culture, embryogenic calli(Figl) induced from the leaf gave rise to embryos ( Fig 2 ) in embryogenic media according to the method previously described. For Agrobacterium mediated Transformation, Agrobacterium strains harboring a binary vector containing P -glucuronidase {gus) as a reporter gene and hygromycin phosphotransferase (hpt) as a marker gene in the T-DNA region of the vector was used. Freshly subcultured primary emgryos (3 days after culture) were co-cultivated in bacterial suspension (absorbance of 0.6 OD at 600 nm) in MS liquid medium containing lOOuM acetosyringone for 30 min at 25°C, ultrasonicated at frequency<br><br>
of 50Hz for a period of 30 seconds in order to make micro wounding on the surface of somatic embryos to facilitate infection of Agrobactehum for T-DNA transfer. These somatic embryos were transferred to MS agar medium containing 200 uM acetosyringone, 3% sucrose at 25°C. in the dark for two days. To eliminate bacteria, the somatic embryos were washed 5 times with sterilized water, followed by water containing 500 mg/l cefotaxim once. Thereafter the somatic embryos were cultured on half strength MS medium supplimented wth 15,000-20,000 mg/l of sucrose; half strength vitamins selected from MS medium; 80-120 mg/l inositol, growth hormones selected from 1-2 mg/l Thidiazuron (TDZ); antibiotics for selection of putative transgenic secondary embryos-hygromycin 5-20 mg/l, antibiotic for killing the Agrobactehum -Cephotaxim 350mg/l &amp; Augmentin300 mg/l, agar 6000 - 8000 mg at pH levels of 5.4-6.2. After 2 months of culture, initiation of putative transgenic secondary embryos (Fig 3) were found. These secondary embryos were transferred to fresh medium with an increased concentration of hygromycin (50 mg/l) and low concentration of Thidiazuron. After 2 months of culture, each line of secondary embryogenic mass was maintained by transferring to fresh medium containing 50 mg/l hygromycin. These secondary embryos gave rise to small plantlets which are resistant to hygromycin (Fig 4). Histochemical GUS Assay<br>
Histochemical   assays   of   GUS   were   performed   for   hygromycin-resistant secondary somatic embryos according to the method of Van Boxtel et al. (1995).<br><br>
Hygromycin resistant secondary embryos   were reacted with X-gluc solution showed a strong GUS positive reaction (FIG. 5 ) However, secondary embryos without co-cultivation did not show any GUS activity . PCR for hpt gene:<br>
DNA extraction from leaves of coffee plantlets showing hygromycine resistance was carried out using genomic DNA isolation kit (Sigma USA) according to the manufacturers instruction. The primers used for amplifying the 497 bp hpt gene were 5'-gatgttggcgacctcgtatt-3' and 5'-gtgtcacgttgcaagacctg-3' . The reaction mixture for PCR was incubated in a DNA thermal cycler Primus-MWG Biotech, under the following conditions: 96°C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, 50°C for 30 sec, and 72°C for 2 min with a final 5 min extension at 72°C PCR revealed amplification of 497 bp fragment of the hpt gene ( FIG 6). Further confirmation of the transformants were carried out by southern hybridization using a labeled probe to hybridize the 497 bp PCR fragment (Fig 7). In untransformed platelets, neither GUS staining nor hpt fragment amplification was detected.<br>
