				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a composition useful for drug delivery. More particularly, the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition which includes a permeation enhancer, that is, a material which is capable of increasing the rate of passage of a pharmaceutical compound through a nail and/or membrane.<br>
The present invention will be described initially with respect to its use in the treatment of fungal infections of the nail of the finger or toe. It should be understood, however, that Ihe present invention can be used in other applications as well, as described below.<br>
Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nail which affects 7 to 8 % of the North American population, including 15 to 20 % of adults aged 40 to 60 years and 25 to 40 % of adults over 60. Onychomycosis causes thickening and discoloration of the nail andean cause also loss or deterioration of the nail, pain, impaired circulation, and difficulty in walking, among other adverse effects.<br>
Treatment of onychomycosis has in the past included measures such as removal of the infected portion of the nail or removal of the entire nail. This form<br>
1<br><br>
w of treatment, however, may lead to permanent damage to the nail and the nail, if it grows back, may grow back in a misshapen form. In addition, there is no guarantee that onychomycosis is eradicated completely h\ nail removal.<br>
Instead of nail removal, it is preferable to treat onychomycosis through the use of a variety of anti-fungal agents. Traditionally, such anti-fungal agents are administered orally. Upon administration, the agent moves through the body where small amounts of the agent arrive al the target area and penetrate the nail via the naii matrix. Oral administration is disadvantageous, however, in that such administration requires a prolonged treatment of about 12 weeks for toenails and about 6 to about 8 weeks for fingernails. Such prolonged treatment increases the cost of the treatment and reduces patient compliance. In addition, oral treatment creates a risk of intoxication, gastrointestinal irritation, nausea, adverse drug-to-drug interactions, drug-induced rash, and other adverse side affects. Moreover, variable rates of absorption and metabolism are often encountered in oral treatment.<br>
Another method of treating onychomycosis involves the topical administration of a composition containing an anti-fungal agent. It is this method of treatment to which the present invention relates.<br>
Reported Developments<br>
It is known to treat the fungai infection of the nail by applying to the nail a pharmaceutical composition which contains an anti-fungal agent, for example, clotrimazole. The pharmaceutical composition is typically in the form of a nail lacquer, for example, as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,264,206. Such lacquers, however, have had limited success m the treatment of onychomycosis because Ihe anti-fungal agents are not particularly effective in penetrating the nail and the skin surrounding and underneath the nail (the "nail bed")-<br>
I<br><br>
Thtz addition to the pharmaceutical composition of a permeation enhancer to improve the delivery of the anti-fungal diiig to (he target area has been proposed. For example. U.S. Patent No. 5.346.692 discloses a nail lacquer composition which comprises an anti-fungal agent and urea as a permeation enhancer.  Urea functions, however, by breaking down and disrupting ihe nail or skin in order to permit the anti-fungal agent to penetrate the deeper layers of the naii and nail bed. Accordingly, the use of urea results in damage to [he nail and membrane.<br>
Another composition for treating onychomycosis by applying the composition to the nail is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,814,305. This composition comprises: (A) an anti-fungal agent which is at least partially soluble in water; (B) a hydrophilic permeation enhancer; (C) water; and (D) alcohol. Anti-fungal agents of the allyiamine family, such as terbinafine hydrochloride and naftifinc hydrochloride, are preferred for use in the compositions of the "305 patent. The patent discloses the use of the following hydrophilic permeation enhancers: glycols; glycol diethers; caprolactam; dimethylisosorbide; isopropylidene glycerol;<br>
dimethylimidazolidinone; N-methyl-pyrrolidone-2; pyrrolidone-2; ethyl lactate, and polyoxyefhylenated glycerides. A disadvantage associated with the use of the composition described in the "305 patent is that a hydrophilic delivery system is used and most anti-fungal agents, in particular the azoies, are lipophilic. Lipophilic enhancers have been shown to be more efficient than hydrophilic enhancers in increasing the absorption of pharmaceutical compounds into the strata of the membrane and the nail. Moreover, lipophilic antifungal agents are preferred since they have a tendency to penetrate more readily the membrane.<br>
The present invention provides an improved composition that can be applied to the nail for the purpose of treating a fungal infection that afflicts the nail and or nail bed and that can be used in other applications also.<br><f></f><br>
Summary of Hie Invention<br>
In accordance with this invention, there is provided a composition comprising: (A) a pharmaceutical compound; (B) a membrane-compatible permeation enhancer; and (C) a polymeric film-forming agent.<br>
In addition, the present invention provides also a composition which is particularly suited !o treating a nail disorder and which comprises a hydrocarbon-based liquid nail lacquer comprising a solution of: (A) an anti-fungal agent in a pbarmaceuticalty-effective amount; (B) a membrane-compatible permeation enhanceT in an amount effective to enhance penetration through a membrane or nai! of said anti-fungal agent; (C) a polymeric film-forming agent in an amount effective to form an adherent polymeric film on a membrane or nail; and (D) solvent for forming said solution.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention is the provision of a method for administering to the body through the nail or membrane of the body comprising: (A) applying to the nail or membrane a liquid composition comprising a pharmaceutical compound, a membrane-compatible permeation enhancer, and a polymeric film-forming agent; (B) forming from said liquid composition a solid film which adheres to the nail or membrane; and (CJ maintaining said film on the nail or membrane for a period of time sufficient for delivery of the pharmaceutical compound to the body through the nail or membrane.<br>
Still another aspect of (he present invention is the provision of a method for forming a solid adherent film comprising a pharmaceutical compound and an enhancer therefore comprising: (a) providing a solution in which the pharmaceutical compound, the enhancer, and a polymeric film-forming agent are dissolved, the solution containing a co-solvent which includes: (i) a highly volatile solvent for the enhancer in which the enhancer is highly soluble; and (ii) a less volatile solvent in which the enhancer is less soluble; and (b) applying said soluble solution to the nail<br>
5"<br><br>
or membrane; (c) forming from said solution a solid film which includes the pharmaceutical compound and the enhancer by permitting the highly volatile solvent to evaporate at a ft.st jr rate than the solvent having lower volatility; and (d) drying the resulting film.<br>
It will be appreciated from the discussion which follows that (he present invention provides an important advantage in that it can be used effectively to treat body conditions such as onychomycosis or other fungal infections, bacterial infections, and inflammation.<br>
Detailed Description of Ihe Invention<br>
The composition of the present invention comprises a pharmaceutical^ effective amount of a pharmaceutical compound. Essentially any pharmaceutical compound which is capable of being delivered transdermally may be used in the practice of the present invention. The compound may be therapeutic or prophylactic. Examples of pharmaceutical compounds that may be employed in the practice of the present invention include topically-effective agents, such as: anti¬inflammatory corticosteroids; antibacterial agents; antiviral agents; and topical anti¬cancer agents, such as 5-ftuorouracil or other fluorinated purine, cytosine and pyrimidine analogs.<br>
In embodiments of the present invention in which anti-fungal agents are used, the composition comprises a pharmaceutically effective amount of an anti¬fungal agent which is capable of treating an infection residing in the nail and/or the nail bed. Essentially, any suitable anti-fungal agent may be employed. The anti¬fungal agent may be present also in combination with an anti-inflammatory agent and/or another anti-microbial agent such as, for example, an anti-bacterial agent or an anti-viral agent.<br>
U<br><br>
It is known that anti-fungal agents can function in various ways. For example, one class of anti-fungal agents works by impairing the functions of membrane-bound enzyme systems in the fungal cell membrane. Examples of such anti-fungal agents are azolcs, for example, tioconazole. econazole, miconazole, terconazole; clotrimazole, bifonazole, butaconazole, chlordantoin, chlormidazole, cloconazole, entlconazole, tenticonazole, isoconazole, ketoconazole, omoconazole, oxiconazole nitrate, and suiconazoie.<br>
It is known also that another class of anti-fungal agents functions by inhibition of oxidosqualene cyclase, thus deterring or preventing the formation of the requisite ergosterol. Examples of such agents are allylamines, for example, terbinafine and naftifine.<br>
Still another class of anti-fungal agents functions by compromising the integrity of the fungal cell membrane; an example of such an anti-fungal agent is ciclopirox.<br>
Anti-fiingal agents that work by varied modes of action as fungicidal or fungistatic agents may be employed also, for example, amorolfine, griseofluvin, nystatin, amphotericin B.<br>
Clotrimazole and fluconazole are preferred anti-fungal agents for use in the practice of the present invention.<br>
The pharmaceutical compound is present in the composition in a pharmaceuticaliy effective concentration, which may be determined by those of ordinary skill in the art. Preferably, the concentration does not exceed the maximum amount that remains soluble in the composition, a parameter which can be determined readily also. For guideline purposes, it is believed most applications will involve the use of the pharmaceutical compound in an amount of about 0.1% to about 15% by weight of the composition. A preferred amount of the compound is<br><br>
about l%to about 10% by weight of the composition, more preferably about ]%to about 8% by weighl of the composition, and most preferably about 2% to about 5% by weighl of the composition.<br>
The composition comprises also a membrane-compatible permeation enhancer which is capable of increasing the rate of passage of the pharmaceutical compound through a nail and/or membrane, that is, a layer of body tissue, for example, skin. The term "membrane-compatible permeation enhancer" means a compound which increases the rate of delivery of the pharmaceutical compound through the nail/membrane without damage.<br>
It is known that other enhancers function by a mechanism which involves hydrolysis, keratolysis, denaturation, or other mechanism which tends to damage the nail or the membrane. Examples of such enhancers include urea, sulfhydryl group-containing amino acids, alkyl sulfoxides, and related compounds which function by breaking down, extracting, or disrupting the nai! or membrane in order to permit the pharmaceutical compound to penetrate to deeper layers of the membrane.<br>
The membrane-compatible enhancer of the present invention can be applied<br>
safely to the membrane or to a nail without causing damage to the membrane or nail.<br>
Essentially any membrane-compatible permeation enhancer or mixture of enhancers may be used in the practice of the present invention. Preferred membrane-compatible enhancers are lipophilic enhancers which render cellular membranes more permeable by intercalating within the membrane. Examples of such lipophilic enhancers include alkylesters, for example, isopropyl myristate and myristyl myristate.<br>
Examples of a particularly preferred class of membrane-compatible permeation enhancers are compounds which are described in U.S. Patent No.<br><br><br><br>
or 1. q is an integer ha vim a value off) or 1. r is an integer having a value of 0 or I, and each of R, R,, R,, R_„ ^, R,, and Rh is independently hydrogen or an alky! group having from 1 lo 6 i aroon atoms which may be straight chained or branched, provided that only one of R, to Rs can be alky] group, with the proviso that when p, q and r are 0 and Y is oxygen, then m+n is at least 1 ], and with the further proviso that when X is an imino group, q is equal to 1, Y is oxygen, and p and r are 0, then m+n is at least 11. For convenience, an enhancer of Formula I above is referred to herein as a "macrocyclic enhancer".<br>
Macrocyclic enhancers have several desirable properties in addition to their "enhancing" properties. For example, they have the ability to form a stable homogenous solution with the other components of the composition of the present invention and to function as a plasticizer and fluidizer in a film which is formed from the composition. This improves the performance properties of the film by rendering it pliable. This is surprising, because the preferred enhancer compounds, for example, oxacyclohexadecan-2-one, are solids at room temperature. However, a liquid composition of the present invention in which the enhancer is dissolved is capable of forming a solid polymeric film which is clear and elastic. In addition, the film is capable of being resolubilized by successive applications of the film, providing a continuous, replenished delivery system without discontinuity or disruption of the pharmaceutical compound.<br>
Those skilled in the art will recognize which permeation enhancers are used preferably with the particular pharmaceutical compounds that are included in the composition. Particularly preferred membrane-compatible permeation enhancer for use in the practice of the present invention are oxacyclohexadecan-2-one, muscove, civetone, and normuscone.<br>
The membrane-compatible permeation enhancer is present in the composition in a concentration effective to enhance penetration through the nail and/or membrane of the pharmaceutical compound to be delivered. The "effective<br><br>
amount" can be determined readily by the skilled artisan. For guideline purposes, it is believed most applications v. ill involve the use of the membrane-compatible permeation enhancer in an amount of about 1% to about 25% by weight of the composition, preferably about 5% to about 20% by weight of the composition.<br>
The composition comprises also a polymeric film-forming agent or mixture of film-forming agents. Essentially, there can be used any polymer thai is capable of forming a film from which the pharmaccuiica) compound can be delivered to the nai! or membrane, for example, the nail bed. For example, occlusive and semi-occlusive polymers which are known for use in transdermal drug delivery can be used.  Because the primary objective is drug delivery, even those polymers otherwise rejected for cosmetic end uses for less than ideal cosmetic properties can be used in the practice of the present invention.<br>
Examples of suitable polymeric film-forming agents include polymers of acrylic acid, acrylic acid esters and copolymers thereof; polymers of methacrylic acid, methacrylic acid esters and copolymers thereof; polymers of vinyl acetate and copolymers thereof with acrylic acid and acrylic acid esters; copolymers of methyl vinyl ethers with maleic acid, maleic acid alky] esters, and combinations thereof; copolymers of vinyl pyrrolidone with styrene; polyvinyl butyrates); polymeric cellulose derivatives such as cellulose acetate phthalate, cellulose acetate butyrate, cellulose acetate propionate, cellulose nitrate, cellulose sulfate, ethyl cellulose, and cellulose acetate; terpolymers of vinyl acetate with butyl maleate and isobornyl acetate; terpolymcrs of vinyl caprolaclam with vinyl pyrrolidone and dimethylamino ethyl methacrylate. The film-forming agent can be used in solid, for example, powdery form in formulating a composition of the present invention. In addition, the composition may be formulated also by use of a latex.<br>
Examples of preferred polymeric film-forming agents include: quaternary ammonium-containing acrylic acid ester; methacrylic acid ester copolymers known as ammonio methacrylate copolymers such as, for example, ethyl acrylate-[2-<br><br>
(methacryloyloxy) ethyl] trimethylammonium clilonde-methyl methacrylate copolymer;  and substituted copolymers of alkylated polyfvinyl pyrrol id ones). These polymeric film-forming agents are preferred because Ihcy demonstrate superior adhesive, water- resistance and hardness properties.  Particularly preferred are polymeric film-forming agents that have been registered with regulatory agencies for pharmaceutical use, including, but not restricted to the European or United States Pharmacopeia, and the Japanese Pharmaceutical Excipients Compendia.<br>
The polymeric film-forming agent is present in an amount effective to form on the membrane or the nail an adherent polymeric film. Amounts can be determined readily for any particular application. For guideline purposes, it is believed most applications will involve the use of the polymeric film-forming agent in an amount of about 0.1 % to about 35%, preferably about 5% to about 35% by weight of the composition and more typically, and most preferably, in an amount of about 10% to about 25% by weight of the composition.<br>
The composition comprises also a solvent for those ingredients to be liquified. Essentially any solvent or solvent combination which is a suitable vehicle for the composition of the present invention can be employed. Examples of such solvents are alcohols, esters, ethers, aromatic hydrocarbons, aldehydes, ketones, mono-, di- and tri-glycerides, and the like.<br>
It is believed that the solvents that will be used most widely in the practice of the present invention are ethanol, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, isopropanol, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, triacetin, tripropionin, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, and isopropyl acetate, and a mixture of two or more of the aforementioned. Ethanol, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, isopropanol, methyl ethyl ketone and acetone are preferred solvents as they evaporate and dry readily when applied.<br><br>
The solvent is present in the composition in an amount sufficient to solubilize the ingredients that are to be liquified, for example, a solid polymeric film-forming agent, and other ingredients, without resulting in unsatisfactory drying times or film properties. For guideline purposes, it is believed most applications will involve the use of the solvent in an amount of about 30% to about 80% by weight of the composition and more typically, and preferably, m an amount of about 40% to about 70% by weighl of the composition.<br>
In forming preferred compositions within the scope of the present invention, there are several factors that should be taken in to account in selecting the particular pharmaceutical compound, enhancer, film-forming agent, and solvent that comprises the composition. The preferred composition is one which is capable of forming a solid film in a manner such that the concentrations of the pharmaceutical compound and enhancer are relatively high in the portion of the solid film which is contiguous to the surface on which the solid film is formed, for example, a nail surface.<br>
By way of background, it is noted that the term "fugacity" is used to refer to the measure of the escaping tendency of a solute in a solution and that the fugacity of a solute follows Henry"s Law for ideal states. Various methods can be used in order to increase the fugacity of the pharmaceutical compound and enhancer, that is, to increase the concentrations thereof at the desired site.<br>
For example, with respect to a pharmaceutical compound which is basic in nature, the polymeric film-forming agent used in combination therewith is preferably also basic in nahrre. Such basic compounds tend to repel each because of the positive charges associated therewith, thus increasing the fugacity of the pharmaceutical compound. Examples of polymeric film-forming agents that have a basic moiety or functionality are acrylale copolymers, for example, those that have intermittently distributed dimethylamino functionalities. Another method that can be used to increase the fugacity of the pharmaceutical compound and the film-<br><br>
forming agent is lo add to (he solutioi. (hereof a basic compound, for example, TR[S ammo or triclhanolamine.<br>
With respect to the use of an acidic-type pharmaceutical compound, for example, an acidic anti-fungal agent such as ciclopirox, there can be used a polymeric film-forming agent that is acidic in nature. Examples of film-forming agents that have acid functionality are polymers or co-polymers of acrylic acid or methacrylic acid, for example, co-polymers of such acids with esters thereof.<br>
The following is a description of a method to increase the fugacity of the permeation enhancer. The method involves formulating a composition comprising a permeation enhancer dissolved in a volatile solvent, for example, a solvent which has a vapor pressure sufficient to allow it to evaporate within 5 minutes after application, and a less volatile solvent in which the permeation enhancer has limited solubility, for example, a solubility of up to 5 weight percent. Such a composition comprises co-solvents for the permeation enhancer. In the formation of the film from the composition, the volatile solvent evaporates preferentially relative to the less-volatile solvent which remains (but temporarily) in the composition. As this occurs, the fugacity of the permeation enhancer increases. A cosolvent that increases the fugacity of a permeation enhancer upon the evaporation of a more volatile solvent in which the permeation enhancer is highly soluble includes, for example, propylene glycol.<br>
An exemplary method for increasing the fugacity of both the pharmaceutical compound, for example, an anti-fungal agent, which has limited solubility in water, and a permeation enhancer which has relatively high hydrophobicity (more limited water solubility then the pharmaceutical compound) is to include water in the composition, for example, in an amount up to about 20% by weight of the composition, preferably about 1% to about 10%, and most preferably about 3% to about 7% by weight of the composition.<br><br>
The foregoing description provides exemplary methods which may be employed to maximize the release of both the pharmaceutical compound and the enhancer or to provide more subtle increases and decreases in the fugacity of each component together or independently. Accordingly, the present invention provides a means by which the release rate of either or both of the aforementioned components may be designed for more prolonged, controlled, or direct release of the medication.<br>
One or more plasticizers can be included in the composition lo impart desired properties to the film formed from the composition. In selecting a plasticizcr and amount to use, there should be taken into account whether the permeation enhancer that is present in the composition has plasticizing properties. Essentially any plasticizer can be employed. Examples of plasticizers arc propylene glycol, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, propylene glycol monopropyl ether, polyethylene and poly(propylene glycol), triacetin, tripropionin, castor oil, camphor, phthalates, particularly dibutyl phthalate and diethyl phthalate, benzyl alcohol, phenethyl alcohol, and N-methyl-2-pyrroIidone, and a mixture of two or more of the aforementioned. As is known in the art, the plasticizer should be matched with the polymeric film-forming agent that is used in the composition.<br>
It is believed that the plasticizers that will be used most widely in the practice of the present invention will be propylene glycol, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, polyethylene and polypropylene glycol), triacetin, and tripropionin, and a mixture of two or more of the aforementioned. Propylene glycol, is among the preferred plasticizers.<br>
The plasticizer is present in an amount sufficient to provide the desired plasticizing properties to the polymeric film that is formed from the composition. For guideline purposes, it is believed most applications will involve the use of the plasticizer in an amount of 1% to about 25% by weight of the composition and more typically in an amount of about 1% to about 10% by weight of the composition.<br>
I?<br><br>
The composition may include also other art-recognized components in art-recognized quantities. A coloring agent may be used, for example, a dye, color pigment, color lake, pearl gloss dye or pigment, for example, titanium dioxide, and the like. Other components include colloid stabilizers, UV stabilizers, antibacterial or bacteriostatic substances such as quaternary ammonium antimicrobial agents, for example, cetyl pyridinium chloride, and benzalkonium chloride, anti-oxidants, for example, BHA, BUT, parabens, vitamin E and its derivatives, anti-microbial chelating agents, for example, EDTA and citric acid, and neutralizing agents, for example, TRIS amino, triethylamine, triethanolamine, 2-methyl-2-amino-l-propanol, citric acid, and sorbic acid.<br>
The composition of the present invention is applied to the membrane or the nail like any conventional composition that is capable of forming a solid film. The film can be formed from multiple coats of the composition. One or more successive coats may be applied typically after the underlying film is formed as the solvent evaporates and the wet film dries. Periodic replacement of the film may be required to maintain the desired drug dosage regimen.<br>
It is preferred that the components of the liquid composition be compatible with each other so that a clear film, free from clouding before and after application results. The film should remain preferably clear and non-cloudy for each successive application. Clearness of the film is an indication that the desired molecules of anti¬fungal agent and permeation enhancer are in a glassy state, and have not crystallized; otherwise the molecules may cease to migrate and not reach the intended target, the infected nail and membrane. Such a "cold flow" condition is important to remediating the infection in an efficient manner.<br>
As can be appreciated from the discussion above, the present invention provides an important advantage in that it can be used effectively to treat body conditions such as onychomycosis or other fungal infections, bacterial infections, and inflammation.<br><br>

Nails in all cases became clearer, harder, and the discoloration disappeared gradually. The cure proceeded from the cuticle to the distal nail. Complete cures, indicated by completely normal appearing naiis, were achieved in all cases within 120 days of the beginning of the treatment. In two of the patients who were experiencing pain and tenderness in the nail, surprisingly, within one month after beginning treatment, the pain and tenderness subsided.<br>

The gel of Example No. 6 was applied to excised guinea pig skin in a standard Franz celi apparatus (in vitro) or as a film on a 10 cm2 area on live guinea pig skin (30 mg formulation applied) that had been prepared previously by shaving (in vivo). In vitro permeation time varied among 24, 48, and 72 hours and the total skin section was assayed. In vivo permeation time was seven (7) hours, after which the animals were euthanized, the skin washed, and skin separated into epidermis and dermis. The clotrimazole levels were measured in all cases by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Lotrimin cream (1% clotrimazole) served as the control. The test results showed clearly a great magnitude of increase of permeation through the skin either in vitro or in vivo of the antifungal agent, clotrimazole, by one of the enhancing agents of the present invention, oxacyclohexadecan-2-one. It is believed that the present invention provides improved means for efficient and effective delivery of a pharmaceutical compound to the body by delivery thereof through a nail or membrane of the body.<br>
