[0015]<br>
A solar cell panel (hereinafter referred to as "panel") 8 having a structure described later is fitted to the basket 7. The panel 8 is not limited to a non-flexible plate form member, but may be one having flexibility to such an extent as to maintain its original shape in the condition of being mounted on the basket 7,<br>
such as  an  amorphous   film.<br>
[0016]<br>
At the rear ends of a left-right pair of rear forks 24 extended to the rear side from the seat post 23, a rear wheel WR as a driving wheel disposed between the pair of rear forks 24 is shaft-supported. A left-right pair of stays 25 is provided between an upper portion of the seat post 23 and both the rear forks 24.<br>
[0017]<br>
A seat 9 is fitted to an upper portion of the seat post 23 so that its height can be adjusted. A battery-storage box 11 for detachably storing a battery 10 is provided on the lower side of the seat 9 between the seat post 23 and the rear wheel WR.<br>
[0018]<br>
A power unit 13 comprising an electric motor 12 supplied with electric power from the battery 10 stored in the battery storage box 11 is provided on the rear side of the vehicle body with respect to the support pipe which is not shown. An input shaft of the power unit 13, namely, a crankshaft 14 is supported by the support pipe not shown.  Pedals 16 are fitted to the crankshaft 14 through cranks <br><br><br><br><br>

The driving force is transmitted to the rear wheel WR through a chain 17.  The output of the power from the electric motor 12 is controlled by a controller, not shown, according to the magnitude of the tread force.  A tread force detector (not shown) is provided for controlling the electric motor 12 according to the tread force.<br>
[0020]<br>
A harness 18 is provided along the down pipe 22, and electric power generated by the panel 8 is inputted to the battery 10 through a controller in the power unit 13, by way of a cable fitted to the harness 18.<br>
[0021]<br>
Fig. 1 is a side view of a major part of the bicycle.  In the figure, a rear portion of the basket 7 is engaged with the head pipe 21 by a latch 29.  The latch 29 has it one end connected to an upper portion of the head pipe 21, and its other end connected to a rear wall of the basket 7 by, for example, a bolt-nut combination.<br>
[0022]<br>
The panel 8 is supported by a pivot shaft 26<br>
extending in the left-right direction on the rear side of the vehicle body with respect to the basket 7, and is provided turnably with the pivot shaft 26 as a center. The upper side of the basket 7 is opened by turning the panel 8 clockwise in the figure as indicated by 8a-8b from the condition of making contact with the brim of the basket 7.  Further, the panel 8 is moved downwards, directly in the erected posture indicated by symbol 8b. By this, the pivot shaft 26 of the panel 8 is guided by vertical guide holes 27 provided at left and right positions near the rear portion of the basket 7, and the panel 8 is stored in the basket 7 as indicated by symbol 8c.<br>
[0023]<br>
In order to return the panel 8 into a roughly horizontal posture along the brim of the basket 7, it suffices to pull up the panel 8 from the inside of the basket 7, to move the panel 8 so that the pivot shaft 26 is located at the upper ends of the guide holes 27, and then to turn the panel 8 counterclockwise in the figure as indicated by 8b-8a. A main switch 28 of the motor-assisted bicycle 1 is provided in the vicinity of a central portion of the handle 4.<br>
[0024] Fig. 3 is a plan view showing a roughly right half of the panel and the basket, Fig. 4 is a perspective view of a major part showing an engaging portion between the basket and the panel, Fig. 5 is a perspective view of a major part of the basket showing the condition where the panel is stored, Fig. 6 is a view from the upper side of the basket showing the condition where the panel is stored, and Fig. 7 is a perspective view of a major part in the vicinity of the brim of the basket.<br>
[0025]<br>
In these figures, vertically elongate frame bodies 28 are attached to left and right side surfaces of the basket 7.  The frame body 28 is assembled with a window 281 in the manner of overlapping with a slit 71 formed in each side portion of the basket 7, and the window 281 and the slit 71 constitute the guide hole 27.  The slit 71 is opened at the brim of the basket 7 (See Fig. 7).  The position of the frame body 28 is so set that the upper end of the window 281 is located to be extended to the upper side of the opened portion.<br>
[0026]<br>
More concretely, the pivot shaft 26 is bosses 61 extended to the left and right outsides from the panel 8, and the bosses are projected to the outside through the<br>
guide holes 27, namely, the slits 71 and the windows 281. An end portion of the boss 261 is provided with a threaded hole, and a set screw 31 is screwed into the threaded hole. The condition where the panel 8 is erected from the position shown in Figs. 3 and 4 and the bosses 261 are moved along the guide holes 27 to the lowermost portions is shown in Figs. 5 and 6. As seen from these figures, the panel 8 is stored along the rear inside wall of the basket 7, so that the appearance is simple, and the vertical movements of the panel 8 in the basket 7 are smoothly performed along the guide holes 27.<br>
[0027]<br>
Next, a modified example of the structure for storing the panel 8 will be described.  Fig. 8 is a perspective sectional view showing a left half of a front portion of the bicycle according to the modified example, Fig. 9 is a side sectional view of the same, and Fig. 10 is a view from the lower side of a. rear portion of the basket.  Further, Fig. 11 is a plan view of a front portion of the panel, and Fig. 12 is a sectional view taken along B-B of Fig. 11.<br>
[0028]<br>
In this modified example, the panel 8 is provided with a lock. While the panel 8 is used for charging the<br><br>
battery 10, it is so disposed as to cover an upper portion of the basket 7 and, therefore, functions as a lid for the basket 7.  In this modified example, the panel 8 is integrally provided with the lock, whereby the function as the lid is more enriched, and antitheft function for the panel 8 itself is attained. [0029]<br>
In these figures, a tubular lock device 32 projecting to the lower side of the panel 8 (in the roughly horizontal posture along the brim of the basket) is provided at a central portion of the front end of the panel 8.  The panel 8 has a front wall 81 in the manner of covering the lock device 32.  On the other hand, the basket 7 has a horizontal portion 72 opposed to the lower side of the lock device 32 when the panel is set in the roughly horizontal posture so as to cover the upper portion of the basket 7, and a vertical member 73 provided with a hole for engagement with a plunger 321 of the lock device 32 is erected on the horizontal member 72. A cable 40 for transmitting electric power generated which extends to the battery 10 is connected to the vicinity of the pivot shaft of the panel 8. As seen from Figs. 11 and 12, when the panel 8 is set in a horizontal posture to function as the lid for the basket 8 and the<br><br>
lock device 32 is turned to a lock position, the plunger 321 of the lock device 32 is engaged with a hole of the vertical member 73 of the basket 8, resulting in locking.<br>
[0030]<br>
On the other hand, when the panel 8 is lifted up as indicated by a chain line in Fig. 8 and the panel 8 is further put into a roughly vertical posture, the panel 8 can be stored by moving it downwards, in the same manner as described referring to Fig. 3 or the like (posture 8c in Fig. 9).  In this modified example, as shown in Figs. 9 and 10, a partition wall 33 disposed in parallel to the rear wall of the basket 7 is provided.  The partition wall 33 may be provided with an engaging and stopping block 34 at an upper portion thereof.  The engaging and stopping block 34 has a portion having the same function as the vertical member 73 of Fig. 11 which is engaged with the plunger 321 of the lock device 32 at a position where the panel 8 is stored in the basket 8.  Therefore, also in the condition where the panel 8 is stored in the basket 7, the panel 8 is fixed to the basket 7 by the lock device 32.<br>
[0031]<br>
By thus locking with the lock device 32, an antitheft effect is obtained, and, at the same time, it<br><br>
is possible to restrain the panel 8 from chattering and from being scratched easily. The partition wall 33 provides means for indicating the engaging and stopping block 34, and functions to partition the inside of the basket 7 into a luggage-storing space and a space for storing the panel 8, thereby enhancing a protective effect for the panel 8. [0032]<br>
Next, a second modified example will be described. While a structure capable of storing the panel 8 in the basket 7 is adopted in the above example, the panel 8 is stored in a holding portion provided on the rear outside of the basket 7 in this second modified example.  Fig. 13 is a perspective view of the basket, Fig. 14 is a side sectional view, and Fig. 15 is an enlarged sectional view. In these figures, the panel 8 is hooked on hooks 35 provided at a rear upper portion of the basket, in the posture of being mounted roughly horizontally on the basket 7. The hooks 35 each have such a shape as to project upwards from the upper edge of the rear wall 74 of the basket 7 and be bent toward the rear portion of the vehicle body. The hooks 35 are provided at a plurality of positions (in this example, four positions) in the width direction of the basket 7, and the panel 8<br><br>
is provided with engaging holes 82 engageable with the hooks 35, at the same intervals as the hooks 35. [0033]<br>
With this constitution, the hooks 35 are engaged with the engaging holes 82, with the panel 8 in a vertically erected posture. When the hooks 35 are fitted into the engaging holes 82, the panel 8 is tilted down to a horizontal posture to cover an upper portion of the basket 7 .  On the other hand, when the panel 8 is moved to the rear side of the vehicle body in the condition where the panel 8 is erected from the horizontal posture to the vertical posture, the engagement between the engaging holes 82 and the hooks 35 is released, and the panel 8 can be separated from the basket 7. [0034]<br>
In this second modified example, a holding portion capable of accommodating the panel 8 separated from the basket 7 is provided on the outside of the basket 7. A pair of angle members 36 L-shaped in horizontal sectional shape are fitted in the state of being separated from each other in the width direction of the vehicle body, on the outside of the rear wall 74 of the basket 7, as a holding member for the panel 8. The angle member 36 has a receiving portion 361 at a lower portion thereof. Both<br><br>
left and right ends of the panel 8 separated from the basket 7 are guided by the angle members 36, and an end face of the panel 8 located on the rear side at the time of being fitted, namely, the end face on the side where the engaging holes 82 are provided is received by the receiving portions 361, and the panel 8 is held in the posture indicated by symbol 8d in Fig. 14.<br>
[0035]<br>
The basket 7 has a shape contracted to be smaller on the lower side.  Therefore, when the panel 8 is formed in a storable shape conforming to the shape of the basket 7, the width of the panel 8 must be reduced on the side of the rear portion of the basket 7 as shown in Fig. 13. Therefore, when the panel 8 is set to cover the upper portion of the basket 7, gaps G are generated (See Fig. 13) .<br>
[0036]<br>
In view of this, in a third modified example described below, a contrivance to cover the gaps G is made. Fig. 16 is a perspective view of the basket 7 according to the third modified example, in which the same symbols as in Fig. 13 denote the same or equivalent portions. In Fig. 16, triangular auxiliary plates 37 capable of covering the gaps G are provided in the width<br><br>
direction of the panel 8. The auxiliary plates 37 are each connected to the panel 8 by a hinge 38. The auxiliary plates 37 can be folded, and laid on the panel 8, by utilizing pivot shafts of the hinges 38. Thus, the panel 8 can be enlarged by developing so as to eliminate the gaps at the time of covering the upper portion of the basket 7; on the other hand, at the time of being stored on the rear side of the basket 7, the panel 8 can be reduced in size by folding the auxiliary plates 3. [0037]<br>
Fig. 17 is a perspective view of a rear portion of the basket 7 according to a fourth modified example, and Fig. 18 is a perspective view of a cable connecting portion of the panel 8.  In Fig. 17, a cable connecting portion 85 for connecting a cable 40 for transmitting the electric power generated by the panel 8 to the battery 10 is provided at a rear portion of the panel 8.  The cable 40 is connected to an output terminal (not shown) of the panel 8 by the cable connecting portion 85. The cable 40 is led out to the rear side of the vehicle body through a through-hole 741 provided in the rear wall 74 of the basket 7, and is connected to the battery 10 through the above-mentioned harness 18. A diode 41 for inhibiting reverse flow of electric current is provided at an<br><br>
intermediate portion of the cable 40. [0038]<br>
The panel 8 is stored near the rear wall 74 of the basket 7, with the cable connecting portion 85 on the lower side {posture 8d in Fig. 17). At this time, the cable 40 is so treated as to extend upwards from the cable connecting portion 85 to reach the through-hole 741. Namely, the leading-out direction of the cable 40 is changed by 180  , between the situation where the panel 8 is mounted on the basket 7 in a roughly horizontal posture and the situation where the panel 8 is stored in a roughly vertical posture. Accordingly, the cable connecting portion 85 is provided with a groove 851 opened in two directions as shown in Fig. 18, so as thereby to cope with treatment of the cable 40. [0039]<br>
Fig. 19 is a side view of a bicycle comprising a basket (rear basket) mounted on a luggage carrier at a lower portion thereof, in which the same symbols as in Fig. 2 denote the same or equivalent portions.  In the bicycle 1 shown in Fig. 19, the rear basket 43 is fixed on the luggage carrier 42 located on the rear side of the seat 9, and the panel 8 is provided on the rear basket 43. The panel 8 is fitted turnably by a pivot shaft 26, in<br><br>
the same manner as in the case of fitting on the basket 7 located at a front portion of the vehicle body. It should be noted here, however, that the pivot shaft 26 is provided near the front wall of the rear basket 43. The pivot shaft 26 is guided vertically in guide holes 27 provided at side surfaces of the rear basket 43, whereby the panel 8 can be stored in the rear basket 43, which is a constitution applicable in common to the one shown in Fig. 1.<br>
[0040]<br>
The structure shown in Fig. 19 is not limitative; the structures for storing the panel 8 on the inside or outside of the rear basket 43 are the same as the structures for storing the panel 8 on the inside or outside of the front basket 7. Therefore, the constitutions described referring to Figs. 1 to 18 above can be applied to the rear basket 43 and the panel 8 mounted thereon in a roughly horizontal posture.  In the application, it is natural that modifications can be appropriately made by known means according to the shape and size of the rear basket 43.<br>
[0041]<br>
Besides, while examples of mounting the panel on the motor-assisted bicycle have been shown in the above<br><br>
embodiments, the present invention is not limited to the above embodiments; the present invention can be widely applied generally to motor-assisted vehicles in which tread force is assisted by power of an electric motor, and can be applied to motor-driven vehicles such as a motor-driven wheel chair for running by power of an electric motor.  Further, the present invention can be used for engine vehicles, for example, those which comprise a solar cell panel for charging a starting battery.<br>
[0042]<br>
Furthermore, the panel can not only be provided on the basket provided at a front portion or a rear portion of the vehicle body but can also be provided on each of the baskets provided at a front portion and a rear portion of the vehicle body.<br>
[0043]<br>
[Effects of the Invention]<br>
According to the inventions as set forth in claims 1 to 7, the solar cell panel is stored at a position on the side of a central portion of the vehicle body, so that the solar cell panel would not collide with or make contact with external things, and can be made to be stained or scratched with difficulty.  Particularly, since<br><br>
the solar cell panel is protected by a wall surface of the storage box, the arrangement is more effective against scratches and stains.<br>
[0044]<br>
According to the invention as set forth in claim 3, the solar cell panel is not separated from the storage box, so that it can be stored in the storage box in the state of being connected.  Besides, according to the invention as set forth in claim 4, the solar cell panel can be locked in the sate of being mounted on the storage box so as to cover the storage box, so that the solar cell panel can have the function as a lid for the storage box, and can have an antitheft function for the panel itself.<br>
[0045]<br>
In addition, according to the invention as set forth in claim 6, the displacement of the cable at the time of swiveling the solar cell panel around the pivot shaft can be reduced, so that the wiring length of the cable can be reduced. Furthermore, according to the invention as set forth in claim 7, the solar cell panel can be protected from external things by the wall of the storage box, and, at the same time, the original purpose of the storage box to store other things than the solar<br><br>
cell panel can be sufficiently attained.<br>
