				<td>A COMBINER CYCLE POWER GENERATING SYSTEM AND<br>
A PROCESS FOR PRODUCING WATER OF IMPROVED QUALITY<br>
Fieid of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to the fundamental principles of combining different types of<br>
energy and systems for converting energy into power, and more particularly for<br>
converting heat energy into electric power energy, mostly with gravitational acceleration,<br>
according to improvements of the methods and systems disclosed in South African<br>
patent number 97/1984 and patent application 98/8561 which has not been published.<br>
Background to the invention and the State of Art<br>
Denotation: Represent depth below surface by z, measured positive downwards; g to<br>
denote gravitational acceleration and m to be mass. For purposes of this application the<br>
term:<br>
"N" is the ratio of two energy values like two latent heat values;<br>
"T-s diagram" means the presentation en a graph with scales of temperature and<br>
entropy, of the state of condition of a fluid subject to variable temperature and energy<br>
ieveis;<br>
"Work" is one cf the forms of energy;<br>
"Cycie" means a thermodyramic T-s cycle as presented in a T-s diagram and/or a mass<br>
circulation system operating in a closed loop;<br>
"Preheating" means to increase the energy and/or entropy of a fluid;<br>
"Drenching" means the addition of iow entropy fiuid(s) to to nigh entropy fluid(s) to<br>
reduce the high entropy of the formed fluid. The lower level of the high entropy limit of<br>
the entropy state of condition can disc be reached by heat extraction and/or incomplete<br>
heat supply to fluid;<br>
"Power Cycie" includes thermodynamic cycle(s) empioyed to produce more output<br>
power than power consumed to complete the cycle, in the "conventional" power cycle<br>
fluid is pressurised, vaporised or gassified by the addition of heat, depressurised to do<br>
work, liquefied by the removal of heat in a continual process to form a cycle.<br>
In this document the power cycie includes a cycle in which low entropy fluid, preheated<br>
and drenched to any convenient level, is pressurised mostly by gravity, the pressurised<br>
fluid is partly depressurised to produce power, heated to higher entropy level by addition<br>
of heat, depressurised further by elevation against gravity, fiuidised or liquified by the<br>
removal of heat in a continual process to form a cycle. The entropy extent of the power<br>
cycle is conveniently reduced to a more profitable value by preheating and/or drenching<br>
to produce less netto work per cycle and to produce globally more work per co-operating<br>
countercyde of a refrigeration fluid.<br>
"Refrigeration Cycle" means a "conventional" cycie that discards heat at high, or high<br>
and intermediate temperature(s), consumes heat at low, or low and intermediate<br>
temperature(s) and consumes and produces heat and work in circulation. Fluid(s),<br>
mostly gas or vapour at high entropy level is pressurised to a significant extent by gravity<br>
in being lowered in a column, is vaporised or liquefied to be a low entropy fluid by the<br>
release or rejection of heat, to become a liquid and/or vapour or pre-heated vapour, in<br>
 order to be of decreased entropy, the low entropy fluid becomes pressurised<br>
mechanically and depressurised to a significant extent by gravity, in moving up a column,<br>
the depressurised fluid heated by receiving heat to become a gas or vapour or drenched<br>
to be a high entropy fluid, recircuiated to become a continual cycie.<br>
"Countsrcycie" mens a cycie running in the opposite sense compared to another cycle.<br>
 In this document a countercyde includes two therrnodynamic cycles operating ss a<br>
combination as a power cycle and a refrigeration cycle, mostly in the sense that the<br>
refrigeration cycie prescribes the operation of the power cycle and the combined<br>
countercycle consumes heat and produces power. Commonly the temperature range<br>
of the refrigeration cycie must be cooler at the cold end and hotter at the hot end of the<br>
two thermodynamic cycles. In this document the dominance of the refrigeration cycle<br>
over the power cycie is maintained in the sense that power input to the refrigeration<br>
cycle maintains the running of countercycles, even if the two or more cycle fluids are<br>
mixed to operate at the same temperatures.<br>
For purposes of this application Countercycle Power Production is obtained by running<br>
a power T-s cycle inside or up to the boundary of a refrigeration T-s cycle.<br>
Heat engines and refrigeration systems are well, known in the art and have been<br>
subjected to extensive theoretical analysis. Typically the systems operate on closed<br>
circuits of fluid.<br>
With heat engines the fluid is pressurised and then heated, to cause an increase in<br>
temperature and pressure. The pressurised fluid is then made to do work, usually by<br>
driving a turbine whereafter heat and energy is removed from the system to be<br>
pressurised again. Generally, the fluid will be in a iiquid state before heating and in a<br>
gaseous or superheated gas state after heating.<br>
With refrigeration systems a fluid in gas and/or fluid state is compressed mechanically<br>
and/or mostly by gravity, which heats the fluid. Heat is removed in a heat exchanger<br>
and/or fluid mixer and discarded from the refrigeration fluid. Thereafter the compressed<br>
fluid is depressurised mostiy against gravity and/or to do work and cool by evaporation.<br>
At the lower pressure the fluid is allowed to vaporise partially or in whole to consume<br>
heat at low temperature. The low pressure vapour and/or liquid is then pressurised<br>
mechanically and/or by gravity to repeat the cycle.<br>
Typical examples of the use of heat engines are power stations, and of refrigeration<br>
systems are household refrigerators. Some mine cooling systems performs work to<br>
reduce the internal, potential, velocity and/or gravitational energy.<br>
Although the power and refrigeration systems tend to function well, they also tend to be<br>
inefficient due to a number of factors, such as mechanical and thermodynamic<br>
inefficiencies inherent in equipment used to do work, and the need to reject heat and/or<br>
energy.<br>
South African patent number 97/1984 discloses a method of performing work in a cyclic<br>
manner. The method being characterised in that the gas and liquid are pressurised to<br>
a significant extent by the action of gravity in columns.<br>
State of the art features applied are hysteresis ioops, velocity energy, and common T-s<br>
diagram applications.<br>
A yet further feature of the above patent provides for heat flow into the cycis(s) to be<br>
used in energy conversion, applying countercycies of fluid at different temperature<br>
values, consuming low grade heat and even in freezing water in the process of<br>
producing electric power.<br>
The above patent further provides for a system for performing work substantially as<br>
described above comprising a closed circuit defining a flow path, the circuit being<br>
oriented to have an upper and a lower end and such that the action of gravity will cause<br>
a predetermined pressure difference in a fluid contained therein between the ends of the<br>
flow path.<br>
The patent therefore includes gravitational refrigeration of water and power generation<br>
in countercycles by applying fluids having dissimilar latent heat exposures. The new<br>
application claims new versions of the above which change the application of the<br>
academic principles to become practical production units as described in the examples,<br>
and displayed in the figures.<br>
Tne applicant's co-pending South African complete patent application number 98/8551<br>
has not been accepted and has not been published. It describes methods for performing<br>
work by the countercycie method including drenching of the power cycle up to 50%. The<br>
present application describes variable drenching and/or preheating up to or more than<br>
50%, the gas and liquid being pressurised and depressurised to a significant extent by<br>
the action of gravity, the method being characterised in that the density of the fluid in the<br>
column is increased by drenching the vapour with a liquid component of the fluid or<br>
i drenching it by a catalyst fluid or drenching it by any fluid. The new application includes<br>
drenching by internal countercycles of similar fiuid(s) or mixtures of fluids exceeding 50%<br>
drenching.<br>
The unpublished patent application 98/S5S1 further discloses a method for performing<br>
work in thermodynarnic countercycie in.which temperature differences for heat transfer<br>
are obtained by applying two fluids with different rates of heat increase for shaft depth<br>
increase, applied in a manner which causes heat flow at shallow depth from one fluid<br>
to the other and at greater depth to cause reverse heat flow between the fluids. This<br>
has now been extended to fluids of similar rates of heat increase and for a continuous<br>
variation in fluid mix entropies.<br>
The proceeding definitions of terms and figures are applied onwards without limiting the<br>
invention by the abbreviated descriptions. The description of the examples and figures<br>
are local descriptions oniy. The basic theories will apply universally and beyond the<br>
examples.<br>
The state of art including patent ZA 971984 is illustrated in figures 1 and in the following<br>
example which is theoretically correct but unpractical.<br>
State of the art example : From patent ZA 971984, example 2 it is calculated that<br>
power can be produced as shown diagrammatically in figure 1 of this document.<br>
Columns or shafts of 3574 meters length numbered 2, 3, 4 and 5 are filled with C313<br>
gas and/or vapour, C318 liquid, HFC134a liquid and HFC134 vapour and/or gas. input<br>
heat exchanger 8 balances the power energy withdrawn at 9. Heat transfer occurs in<br>
heat exchangers 6 and 7. The power yield is 14.8 kJ/kg. The unappropriated shaft<br>
lengths and heat exchangers S and 7 are addressed in this text and in figures 14 and<br>
17 of this application.<br>
in thermodynamics most operations involving heat may be typified in the classic T-s<br>
diagram shown in figure 3 by state of condition points 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 and 20.<br>
The teams of "preheat" and "drench" are shown in figure 3. If heat is applied at 20 the<br>
fluid becomes preheated to (say) state of condition 25. If power (pressure i.e. work) is<br>
appiied at 25 the state of condition change to 27 which is also a state of condition of<br>
preheat. The entropy of 20 and 21 is increased at 25 and 27. Similarly the state of<br>
condition "gas" at 24 and 25 is changed to "vapour" by withdrawing heat, to state of<br>
conditions 23, 28 and 29. The new term "drenching" implies that the high entropy of<br>
superheated gas or gas at state of conditions 24, 25 and 23 is decreased. The<br>
application of preheating and drenching eventually change the shape of the convention<br>
T-s diagram to a rectangular or square shape like 23, 27, 23, 29, 26. This T-s shape<br>
modification eliminates superheating and it is hereafter commonly applied.<br>
Patent 97/1984 states that a refrigeration cycle encircles a power cycle(s) as shown in<br>
T-s diagrams in figures 4 and 5.<br>
A significant point of the state of the art is illustrated in figures 6, 7 and 8. The<br>
conventional condition of state T-s diagram 47 and the conventional shaft length 48 are in<br>
conflict as shown by the lines between 47 and 48. The display change of 47 to 49<br>
by rotation or inversion as defined in patent ZA 971984 brings dimensions in<br>
correspondence. Conventionally, the depth below surface in a (mine) shaft is measured<br>
positively downwards. The temperature change in T-s diagrams is shown positively upwards.<br>
The temperature of adiabatic compression in a shaft is physically positive in going down the<br>
shaft. The academic T-s display illustrated in Figure 6 (47) is not simulating the physical<br>
temperature change in the shaft in Figure 7 (48). If the academic T-s diagram is plotted on a<br>
negative temperature scale as shown in Figure 8 (49) it simulates the temperature in the<br>
shaft.<br>
The T-X hysteresis loop in figure 18 is common but its application in figure 20 is new.<br>
Components of energy are well known, reference to potential energy in the form of<br>
gravitational acceleration and of velocity energy created in jetting, are applied in the<br>
inventions.<br>
Object of the Invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide methods and systems for converting<br>
heat into electric power, by extending the state of the art with improvements to and<br>
additions to the methods and systems disclosed in previous patents. It exceeds on<br>
previous patents in proposing workable power generation layouts and refrigeration<br>
layouts which invite stray heat to be converted to power in 4, 3 or 2 operating shaft<br>
layouts. This utilises detailed information of the behaviour of practical thermodynamic<br>
fluids, and applies changes in material behaviour associated with induced changes in<br>
property and entropy levels of fluids and catalysts.<br>
Description of the Invention<br>
The invention is expanding the state of the art information and new methods. The<br>
invention includes principles of invented theory, heat balance induction, practical<br>
designs, internal countercycles, new techniques to multiply output with the application<br>
of preheated and drenched countercycles, etc, The cycles are driven by internal heating<br>
on applying gravitational compression on reshaped and equal temperature T-s<br>
diagrams. This magnifies output as shown in figure 9. The two column countercycles<br>
are based on new interpretations of hysteresis loops subject to gravitational acceleration<br>
applying N times countercycles and controlled by regulated temperatures at the top and<br>
bottom of shafts as shown in figures 19 and 20. Tne preferred three column layout is<br>
utterly manageable by controlling only the pumping rate. It applies the new internal<br>
countercycle T-s diagram principle shown in figure 13. The new fluids composition in<br>
the three column layout, may consist of any single or multi-mixed substance qualifying<br>
oniy to safety, inflammability, specified viscosity, density etc. The latter "density"<br>
becomes a design feature in so far as, increased pressure limits the physical layout size<br>
and improves performance. Ammonia, for example can bs pressurised to decrease the<br>
vapour volume from 323 iitre/kg at 0.382 Mega pascal to 25 litre/kg at 4.8 Mega pascals.<br>
Carbon dioxide as a monofiuid in countercycie operates at temperatures below the<br>
temperature of the surround and this invites the entry of stray energy. The design<br>
pressurising fits the state of the art knowledge on pressure underground in mines and<br>
applied in rock engineering as well as with new invented feature to supply power "on the<br>
job" without contaminating the environment. The substances ammonia and carbon<br>
dioxide lend themselves to catalyst action by water. The invention extends to all fluids.<br>
Description and Explanation of Drawings<br>
Figure 1 is a1 schematic display of four working shafts 2, 3, 4 and 5 filled with two<br>
thermodynamic fluids which are not shown. Heat energy is converted to electric power<br>
at 9. The system is continual if circulation pump 10 lifts the liquid in 4. The liquid is<br>
formed in heat exchanger 7 and evaporated in heat exchanger 6. The second fluid is<br>
condensed in reverse, in heat exchangers 7 and 6. The second fluids in column 3 is<br>
compressed by gravity to drive the generator 9 and may require vapour compressor 11.<br>
Details are contained in the state of the art example.<br>
Figure 2 shows sections of a modified layout of columns 2, 3, 4 and 5 in display 1.<br>
Display 12 is rewarding for design since shell 13 resists the fluid system's global<br>
pressure and shells 14, 15 and 15 need to resist partial pressure only. Depending on<br>
the design pressure of the fluids, the three internal column shells may profitably be<br>
inside or alongside one another at the best remunerating choice. This also holds if only<br>
three or two columns are applied.<br>
Figure 3 displays, the classic and known T-s diagram between state of condition points<br>
20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 and 20. The T-s diagram may be preheated according to the<br>
design, say, to line 26-27. Similarly it may be drenched to fine 28-29. Note that the<br>
remaining T-s diagram is the rectangle 26, 27, 28, 29 enclosing fluid only and it is void<br>
of superheated gas.<br>
Figure 4 displays a power cycle 33 completely encircled by a refrigeration cycle 32.<br>
Consequently, the power cycle action is completely dominated by the refrigeration cycle<br>
which supplied heat q1 and absorbs reject q2. Instability in 31 will be created if energy of any<br>
type or form, enters or leaves display 31. it can be envisaged that electricity leaves at 33 and<br>
that balance is resorted to display 31 by supplying heat energy to cycle 32 or 33.<br>
Figure 5 displays two power cycles 34 and 35 encircled by refrigeration cycle 36. If cycles 34<br>
and 35 are similar, twice the netto power from 34 may exceed the netto power consumed by<br>
36. This means that netto power is produced by display 44. the former reference "twice" will<br>
hereafter be called N times. The nett power 36 in Figure 5 of the drawings is the input power<br>
to drive the refrigeration cycle and the total of the two netto powers 34 and 35 are the two<br>
output power components which may exceed the input power 36.<br>
Excessive power yield from 34 and 35 is against the first law, unless input heat is<br>
supplied at, say, 39. If heat 40 plus 41 is iess than heat 39, N must be bigger than two<br>
and the netto power yielded by 44 can be increased from two times to N times if the heat<br>
shortfall at 39 is not over expropriated. Hsat may be supplied to 40 and 41 up to a level<br>
that hot end heats 33, 42 and 43 are in balance. In this case N can be increased further<br>
than described above.<br>
Figures 6 to 8 in display 45 illustrates a shaft or column 43 and two 7-s diagrams. The<br>
conventional T-s diagram 47 is the same as 49 except that ths signs of T and of 3 are<br>
reversed, in figure 3 the work column can be simulated directly with the shaft. For the<br>
conventional T-s diagram 47 ths simulation lines cross.<br>
Nots: If friction is disregarded, a kilogram fluid subject to the state of condition on top<br>
of fioure 43 may be freely contained and lowered to the bottom where ii will gain<br>
condition of state of "shaft bottom". it may be returned to the top to its original siste of<br>
condition. Reasoning shows that the enthaipy change along the length of the shaft 48<br>
is the same as the enthalpy change along the work line of figure 3, only over one<br>
specific shaft depth, called z.<br>
Figure 9 shows the graph of increased power yield according to the state of entropy<br>
drenching of fluid HP80, provided that the HPSO power cycle is encircled by a<br>
refrigeration cycle. The increased power yield with the association of shafts stems from<br>
the total output yield being equal to the smaller yield of a drenched cycle multiplied by<br>
the larger N number of cycles inside the refrigeration cycle.<br>
Figures 10 to 13 expand on figure 3 rotated by 180°. The conventional cycle in figure<br>
10 may be siit into, a power cycle 134, 135, 131, 132, 133, 134 and a refrigeration cycle<br>
134, 135, 130, 128, 127, 134. The two cycles are creating an internal countercycie.<br>
The power and refrigeration cycles are shown separately in figures 11 and 12. The two<br>
cycles may be run simultaneously in vertical shafts of equal length. The first shaft is filled<br>
with gas and/or vapour component 142-143. The third shaft contains the components<br>
are 127, 128 and 129, this being the liquid shaft for pumping liquid to the top. In the<br>
intermediate shaft the components 141-134 and 149-134 are mixed on top and allowed<br>
to pressurise one the other in going down to beyond the T-s diagram to state of<br>
condition 135, up to 152.' At this state of condition power may be extracted up to state<br>
of condition 135. Here the depressurised vapour may be split to complete cycle<br>
components 135-159 and 135-154.<br>
After completing the two internal countercyles in Figure 13, power leaves the system and<br>
this must cause an energy shortfall which can conveniently be compensated for by heat<br>
input along line 153-150. In the absence of heating the system in figures 10 to 13 cause<br>
global freezing. It delivers power without compensation. Stability is reached with heat<br>
supply.<br>
Figures 14 and 15 are displays for preferred layouts of a number of examples applied<br>
tc produce the power in a thres column physical layouts. The conical shafts allow the<br>
velocity energising of fluid in, for example, 172 to store velocity energy, which reduces<br>
the physical size of the layout and the total volume. It creates a better condition of state<br>
for extracting power energy. The layout in figure 14 contains liquid in 173 and 175, and<br>
vapour in the rest of the voids. Figure 15 is a display of the preferred section through<br>
a 3 column power station. It shows a layout adapted specifically to employ catalytic<br>
actions like mixing water and ammonia fluids, water and carbon dioxide, or water and<br>
compressed air. Dispersion occurs at 137, heat input at 188 and/or 185, mixing, jetting<br>
and induction of velocity energy at 139. The mixed mass 191 is pressured and<br>
accelerated before passing power generator 194. The water component in 194 is<br>
circulated with pump 195 and the vapour, like ammonia gas rises through 193 to<br>
complete all cycles.<br>
Figure 16 illustrates a layout where horizontally flowing vapour 78 is velocity energised<br>
in 62 to increase velocity, increase pressure etc on leaving column at 81. Velocity<br>
energy may be applied by extracting liquid at 79, pressurising the liquid in pump 80 to<br>
change the state of condition of the vapour.<br>
Figure 17 Illustrates a power generation layout operating in four working shafts, 85<br>
containing pressurised carbon dioxide liquid from 105, to be distributed by 90 to sprinkie<br>
upcoming R125 vapour (89) to be condensed by evaporation of carbon dioxide.<br>
Tne carbon dioxide vapour is heavier than the F125 vapour and flows downward shaft<br>
87 to be condensed at 99 to form liquid 105 for recycling. Carbon dioxide forms the<br>
refrigeration cycles. The R125 forms the power cycle, by being evaporated at 100 on<br>
receiving heat from CQ2, being of low density the vapour moves up column 89, cools in<br>
rising, liquifies at 94, flows down 83 to produces hydraulic power at 97 before being<br>
dispersed at 98 for re-evaporating. Since N is iarger than one the generated power is<br>
mars than the input power to the carbon dioxide. The power delivered must be<br>
compensated for by adding heat at 102, S3 and/or 101.<br>
Figure 18 shows a known T-X loop between two fluids X, and X, which are mixed in<br>
a proportion X between 0 and 100%. If T is scaled positive downwards like z, loop line<br>
56 is the liquid condensation equilibrium line and 57 the gas evaporation equilibrium line.<br>
In the symmetric loop in display 55,. the two boiling temperatures of the two pure fluids<br>
are the same.<br>
Figure 19 illustrates the change in the hysteresis loop of two fluids as a result of<br>
gravitational compression from 73 at the top of a column to 74 at the bottom of the<br>
column. If the rate of temperature increase for increased pressure of the two fluids are<br>
not the same, the two hysteresis loops become rotated as shown in 63. If the loops in<br>
S3 are mirror images, and the shaft related lines pass through the centres of the loops,<br>
equal amounts of gas and liquid are formed at the top and the bottom of the shaft..<br>
Rotation may be induced as discussed later in figure 20. Heating change the operating<br>
temperature from 68-59 to 70-71. At 70 most of liquid Xt is condensed and less of X2<br>
is evaporated at 71. This cause column fluid instability which may produce power. It<br>
may also cope for unequal latent heats of the two fluids.<br>
Figure 20 is a T-X diagram to fit examples 8 or 10 with mixed fluid inside a two or four<br>
column operating systems to produce power without or with less mechanical<br>
pressurisation. Lines 23/24 and 25/25 are not of equal length. The correct temperature<br>
interval choice ss modified with velocity energy will cause the result that precisely N<br>
times of a specified fluid will evaporate at top and bottom to maximise production. Apply<br>
display 77 in figure 16.<br>
Figure 21: Shafts 117 and 111 are vertical, the first to collect gravitationally driven fluid<br>
to produce power at 115. Latter shaft 111 conveys heated vapour which is not<br>
condensing vertically, to boss temperature and joins skew shaft 103. Condensing liquid<br>
in 109 is collected and stepwise transferred by a series of pipes numbered 115 to the<br>
vertical column 117 for drenching and accelerating fluid. Each duct is equipped with a<br>
partial filled U-tube loop to eliminate vapour gas pressure equalising in shafts 117 and<br>
109.<br>
In the layout in Figure 21 gasses like CO2 and R125 will produce power without pumping<br>
since R125 will rise in 111 and 109 to cool, liquify and drench mixed fluid. The dense<br>
CO2 vapour will complete the two cycles for delivering power by distillation as shown in<br>
figure 20.<br>
Figure 22 shows two working vapour columns 203 and 202. The gas rotates on being<br>
heated at 205 and power is drawn off at 201.. A velocity energy system sucks liquid from<br>
204 apply jet energy at 205 and controls production.<br>
Figure 23 shows curves of temperature, pressure and ammonia solution in water ratio<br>
which are applied in examples. The fluid mixture cycle starts at 165 and it may be<br>
pressurised isothermally in a shaft to state of condition 164. The pressurised mixture<br>
expels heat in the transition. If the expelled heat is consumed at constat pressure the<br>
fluid will change its condition of state from that at 165 to 168 or to a condition between<br>
168 and 184 according to the handling of expelled heat<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The invention applies the theory of thermodynamics, based on two laws. The first law<br>
was redefined to include mass to energy conversion in atomic reactions. The second<br>
law holds exactly when appiied as defined e.g. a Carnot cycle or a single temperature<br>
entropy diagram (T-s diagram). No reference to the second law could be traced which<br>
refers to T-s countsrcyles. New investigations were conducted on the influence of<br>
energy other than heat and work energy together with a T-s diagram, like it's<br>
combination with velocity energy etc, acting simultaneously. The state of art is shown<br>
in figures, 1, 2 and 3. Countercycles are shown in figure 4 and multiple countercycles<br>
in figure 5. T-s cycles with temperature plotted on a positive scale and negative scale<br>
are shown in figures 6 and 8 to illustrate that a component of the state of condition of<br>
the T-s diagram can simulate fluid in a column (48). The common T-s diagram in figure<br>
S is inappropriate..<br>
Heat, temperature, pressure and work specifications can split a T-s cycles as shown in<br>
figure 10. The two fractional cycles together with gravity and catalistic vapour solution<br>
are shown in figures 11 and 12, and the combination of two fractional diagrams in<br>
combination with gravity in figure 13. The ovsrsupply work 135-152 minus input can be<br>
withdrawn with no additional reference to heat demand and supply. This work is<br>
gravitational and chemical work tendered with the implementation of thermodynamics.<br>
Running the diagrams in figure 13 shows that work can be delivered with no heat supply.<br>
This must freeze the system. To reach stability, heat must be supplied. This heat input,<br>
can be supplied at any workable position in figure 13. If input heat comes from the<br>
surround the application of the invention will freeze the surround.<br>
Heat mass is applied in recirculation of at least one cycle of a system of countercycles<br>
in at least two working columns to convert heat energy into work energy by applying<br>
gravity and chemistry. The heat mass of the two fluid systems may be equal. One of<br>
the cycles may dominate the thermodynamic behaviour of the other. One of the fluids<br>
may liquefy when moving upwardly along one of the columns. The fluid in liquid form in<br>
the one column may drench the fluid in the other column and may evaporate the<br>
condensed fluid. Tne difference in the fluid, densities may cause a pressure difference<br>
at the bottom of the columns. The arrangement may be such that the pressure<br>
difference may yield output power and may require heat input.<br>
The combined mass of multi-cycles may enforce excessive enthalpy in fluid at an<br>
enforced intermediate entropy ievel of fluid(s) in shafts to enable heat to be converted<br>
to power.<br>
The system may apply carbon dioxide or mostly carbon dioxide to form a countercycle<br>
converter and/or a recycling countercycle to change heat energy into work energy.<br>
The system may operate with coiumn(s) and fluid(s)at drenching as well as preheating<br>
of very high orders, which may equal or exceed 50%, on condition that drenching plus<br>
preheating does not exceed 100%.<br>
The system may recirculate energy in one or more cycles in countercycles to convert<br>
heat energy into power at an efficiency of up to 100%.<br>
The first aspect of the invention produces power generation by combining<br>
thermodynamics, catalysts and gravity in T-s internal countercycies and gravitational<br>
work as shown in figures 10 to 13. The variable catalyst action is not displayed. The<br>
preferred layout is shown in figure 15, including the positions where appropriate state of<br>
conditions numbers 134, 135, 152, 159 and 150 of figure 13 apply. State of condition<br>
point 134 in the figures does not pre-specify the entropy of point 134. The percentages<br>
drenching and preheating are therefore not pre-specified. Appiy liquid in coiumn 193<br>
and vapour in columns 192 and 199 of figure 15. The stats of condition points 159 and<br>
150 appiy in coiumn 199 to simulate low entropy fluid. To produce power the pump 195<br>
must be applied.<br>
Example 1: Process Scare!: Apply the internal T-s countercycle process on the fluid<br>
consisting of "pure" CO2 and water as a catalyst operating at -8°C at a pressure of 2.8<br>
MPa and 50% drench plus 40% preheat in a 285 m vertical column. The calculated<br>
results show that the minimum power yield is 1.52 kJ/kg CO2 (4 kg cycle). To obtain<br>
"120 megawatt" it will be required to circulate 315.2 Ton/sec of CO2 and the total mass<br>
of fluid in the three shafts in figure 15 must be 30047 tons of CO2 flowing at an average<br>
speed of 3 meters per second. As shown in Figure 2 the three columns fit in a circular<br>
shaft of 28.4 m diameters.<br>
Example 2: Process Fanie: To produce 120 megawatt power in example 1 it requires<br>
heat input at -8°C equivalent to 120 megawatt. The. input heat may be withdrawn from<br>
water stored at 10°C and cooled to become ice at 0°C. A kilogram water delivers 352<br>
kilojoules heat to become ice. At full capacity process Fanie will produce 1225.2 ton ice<br>
per hour which becomes 0.882 million kiioiiters potable water per month, on top of the<br>
power delivery of example 1.<br>
The second aspect of the invention specifies that heat must be supplied somewhere<br>
in figures 14 and 15 otherwise the first aspect will create operations of indefinite<br>
freezing. Tne heat may be supplied at any temperature above the state of condition<br>
points of figure 13. Most of the examples calculated start at temperatures below freezing<br>
point. The heat may originate from running water which may be frozen. If polluted water<br>
or sea water is frozen the ice is not chemically polluted. Pollution components msy be<br>
separated .and exploited. The ice, when melton, is consumable water to be steriiissd to<br>
be potable in general.<br>
An extension of the second aspect shows that the system in the first aspect produces<br>
a global freezer applicable in all applications of freezing.<br>
The Third aspect of the invention claims that the power required for sprinkler irrigation<br>
may be withdrawn from the water to be sprinkled, that sprinkling with cooled irrigation<br>
water causes less evaporation from the sprinkled water and provides better quality water<br>
to the soil being sprinkled.<br>
Example 3 Withdraw heat from flowing water applied at a sprinkler or a township to<br>
deliver 300 kilowatt in a shaft of 40 meter depth. Tne 300 kilowatt is sufficient to drive<br>
a sprinkler irrigation spill point system or a township's power demand. Lowering of the<br>
temperature of the flowing water by 5°C reduces the spill point water evaporation during<br>
sprinkling. More than 5°C lowering may be applied. The column diameters for power<br>
from the sprinkler system are: 1.8 m for compressed air, 1.5 m for the mix column, 0.29<br>
m for the water coiumn and if the two smaller columns are contained in the large column<br>
its diameter must be 2.2 m.<br>
The Fourth aspect of the invention claims that principally the layout in figures 14, 15<br>
and 17 implies that energy is recirculated. To create stability in figure 13 it is required<br>
that power may be withdrawn at 135-152 in figure 13 and the same amount of heat<br>
returned, to complete the internal countercycle associated with gravitational acceleration.<br>
Fluid following the T-s thermal path of a theoretically closed thermodynamic cycle is in<br>
fact ideally a circulating system with specification for trie boundary vaius input and<br>
output.<br>
In other professions and trades the continued use of matter is called recycling. This often<br>
happens without a change in substance, in thermodynamics countercycies recycling,<br>
may yield more work without consuming proportionally more heat. The rate off flowing<br>
of one or both cycles in Figure 13 may be changed.<br>
Instability caused by oversupplying input heat and/or producing iess power will<br>
systematically increase the global temperature like a heater. Stability can be reached by<br>
disposing of heat, similar to thermal power stations.<br>
An operating layout may be unstable and satisfying boundary conditions temporary.<br>
Recycling may be over driving power production without sufficient increases of input<br>
heat, like a refrigerator or like closing a thermal power station. The temperature level<br>
of the whole layout will then decrease, operating as a global freezing unit. Stability is<br>
reached by any of:<br>
consuming heat from the exterior<br>
input heat leaking to the set up<br>
cooling another layout<br>
stopping.<br>
It is obvious that the fluid of an internal countercycle power station, as described above,<br>
can be recirculated or one cycle may be recycled according to design specifications and<br>
boundary conditions.<br>
3etween the conditions described above, stable energy recycling, nominal heat input and<br>
power output will cause conversion of heat into power at efficiencies approaching 100%.<br>
The Fifth aspect of the invention is to operate preceding aspects with fluids which are<br>
not hostile to life. The most common fluids in life are water and air which are appiied<br>
in example 4. Ammonia is a good catalyst which is not human friendly. For the example<br>
assume that 120 Megawatt must be produced in three columns of 95 m length, that the<br>
heat intake temperature is 4°C and drenching is 60%.<br>
Example 4: Process Jaja: Apply the preferred layout in figure 15 to circulate air<br>
catalysts and water compressed to .3.0 MPa. Water is contained in 195, 193 and 187,<br>
and the air fiows in 199 across heat supply 185. It becomes mixed with water in 187,<br>
compressed in 192, and delivers power in 194. The starting temperature at 187 is 4°C,<br>
allowing for heat input at 185 from reject heat at thermal power stations, water or mine<br>
ventilation. Calculations apply a 10 m/sec flow rate to show that 120 Megawatt is<br>
generated by re-circulating 2 931 ton of water and 1 961 ton of air filling the 95 m tall<br>
columns. The column excavation volume is 55.3 x 103 m3. In this example the increase<br>
in operating pressure from 3.0 MPa to 3.084 MPa apply at the 95 metre shaft bottom.<br>
The layout can be fitted in 3 shafts of average diameter 23.3 m (air), 19.2 m (mix) and<br>
3.7 m (water), or the 3 columns in one shaft of 23 m diameter. To reduce the diameters<br>
the shaft lengths may be extended.<br>
The Sixth aspect is that example 4 may be scaled down to be installed in operating<br>
mines for the provision of power and simultaneously airconditioning the mine.<br>
Example 5: Process Fanie: Compare the power delivered by hydraulic means with<br>
power delivered by one of the invented methods. The latter consumes energy by<br>
lowering the temperature of the watsr by 5°C. Given: Vanderkloof dam delivers 120<br>
Megawatt hydroeiectricity on. consuming up to 217 mVs water at a hydrauiic head<br>
approaching SS m. The invented method tested here, applies 20% drenching to R125<br>
CFC gas mixed with carbon dioxide in four columns of 96 m. Heat extracted to<br>
lower the temperature of 217 mVs water by 5°C equals 4542 megawatt. This is 37.85<br>
times more than the delivery capacity of the hydroelectric installation at Vanderkioof<br>
dam.<br>
The compared invented method appiies 20% drenching to R125 to improve the output<br>
according to figure 17, and appiies velocity energy to regulate the process.<br>
The seventh aspect of the invention is to apply cataiytic action in the production of<br>
power. It improves the efficiency of the layout as shown in examples 6 and 7.<br>
Example 6: Show that catalytic action can be appiied together with internal<br>
cauntercycle power generation. With reference to figure 23, start at state of conduction<br>
165 for the mass composed of 15% ammonia gas at 0.3 MPa and 290 K, 35% iiquid<br>
water and 50% nitrogen gas or other non-reacting fluid at 8.0 MPa and 290 K.<br>
According to Dalton's law the total pressure should be S.3 MPa and after lowering by<br>
250 m as shown in figure 15 the pressure at 198 should be 8.4 MPa. Isothermaiiy the<br>
15% ammonia gas should dissolve completely in the water and release 180 kiioioule<br>
heat for 1 kg fluid. According to the design most of this hsat will be consumed in<br>
ammonia gas forming after power delivery. In the heated intermediate stage the heat<br>
can produce power. The iiquid is recycled with pump 195 and the ammonia gas will<br>
circulate aiong 198 and 199 to be drenched again at 187 to complete the cycles, ihe<br>
exact output power at 194 will be more than 10 kJ/kg fluid, depending on the design.<br>
Example 7 The catalytic action in example 6 will operate in a mechanical layout<br>
consisting of a compressor(s) and/or centrifuge(s) for compression, an expander(s) to<br>
produce power and heat exchanger(s) for heat input to complete the internal<br>
counteracting T-s diagram in figure 13.<br>
The examples 6 and 7 demonstrate that the pressure and temperature sensitivity of the<br>
solubility of ammonia in water (figure 23) can be applied as shown in figure 14. The<br>
evaporation and condensation heat is successively conveyed to compressed nitrogen<br>
or other fluid to do the additional work.<br>
The eight aspect of the invention expands on the fifth aspect, in so far as the<br>
combination of gravitational energy plus catalytically produced energy is more than<br>
gravitational energy. Catalytically supplied heat may be withdrawn by applying<br>
centrifuges and expanders to produce power.<br>
The ninth aspect of the invention modifies the power T-s cycle to produce and deliver<br>
more power from the combined couniercycies. Preheating and drenching reduce the<br>
entropy interval of the power cycle, and consequently more power cycles fit inside the<br>
refrigeration cycle. The reduced power cycles individually yield less power. The total<br>
output is the product of individual power cycles times N, the number of cycles. Tnis<br>
product increases as shown in figure 9.<br>
The tenth aspect of the invention applies the well known hysteresis loop between<br>
evaporation and condensation of a varying mixture of two fluids as shown in figure 18,<br>
together with the distortion of loops by gravitational action in shafts as shown in figure<br>
19. On regulating the temperature in two shafts the distorted loop displayed in figure 19<br>
yields various percentages of the mixed fluids X, and X2, as shown by analyzing line 68<br>
to 59 in relation with line 70 to 71. Skew displays, to advance power production as<br>
shown in figure 20, are obtained by regulating the temperature related via the velocity<br>
of flow to the pressure. The tenth aspect is implemented in preferred layout displays<br>
shown in figures 21 and 22.<br>
Example 8 Demonstrate that power production operates in two columns as shown in<br>
figure 21. Consider CO2 and CFC called HP80 on the assumption that no chemical<br>
reaction occurs between the fluids. To obtain equal heat masses mix CO2 and HP30<br>
(20% drench on 20% preheat) in the ratio 23% CO2 and 72% HP80. Let X1 be CO2 and<br>
X2 be HP80. Figure 20 shows that the vapour will contain more R125 at the bottom of<br>
the shaft and less at the top of the shaft. The fluid specific volumes of 18 and 11 I/kg<br>
confirms that CO2 gas will move down and HP80 gas will move up, to condense and<br>
avail HP80 iiquid at the top of the column to a much bigger extent than CO2 liquid.<br>
When applied in a display as shown in figure 21 the CO2 will be highly drenched to<br>
accelerate the operation of the system.<br>
No formula or experience avails to calculate the output. Nominal estimates show that<br>
a mass of 259 ton in a 95 m column will produce about 1.4 megawatt power production.<br>
Example 3: Apply fluids carbon dioxSde and R125 (chemically CHF2CF3) in four<br>
 columns of 10 m length and fluid mixing, as displayed in figure 17. Regulation occurs<br>
at 33 by velocity energy and power is generated at 97 from R125 and CO2 fluid mix as<br>
well as st S3 from high entropy fluid. The R125 and CO2 gas is self circulating due to<br>
densities. Production is regulated by iiquid pump 103, power production pump 83,<br>
generator 97 and velocity pump 93, at a temperature of 280K. Calculations show equal<br>
heat masses for 1 kg CO2 and 1.S5 kg R125 if not drenched. Drenching will increase<br>
production as shown in figure 9. Full cycle power production is 72 J/kg of CO2 circulated<br>
or 13.5 J/kg from the total mass of circulated gas and z=10m: It can- be increased by<br>
drenching. At 10% preheat, 10% drenching and fluid flow velocity 20 m/sec the power<br>
production increases to 129 J/kg total mass or 24.2 per kg of cycle mass. A practical<br>
application of the latter case shows that 3 kilowatt can be generated in a column of 10<br>
m long and 2.2 m diameter. An enlarged layout of 120 megawatt at column height of<br>
48 m requires an encircling shaft of 77 m diameter, which is impractical. For this<br>
capacity a column of 300 m long and diameter of 30.8 m is more proportional.<br>
The eleventh aspect of the invention applies fluid mixing and fluid selections to<br>
eliminate two large heat exchangers of the state of the art displayed in figure 1. The<br>
selection of fluids yield power at 83 in figure 17 from density differences between<br>
vapours as shown in example 9. This is a further aspect of producing power, additive<br>
to liquid induced power production at 97 and in figure 17.<br>
Example 10 Apply the display in figure 22 to generate power. The display shows two<br>
independently acting mechanisms. The first is iiquid store 204, liquid pump 207 and at<br>
205 a generator of veiocity energy which is mostly recoverable. The second mechanism<br>
consists of heat source 206 supplying energy to vapour 203 which, as a result of<br>
nesting, is of smaller density than vapour 202. In the columns the difference in density<br>
causes circulation and therefore deliver power at 201. if the rotation speed is increased<br>
from (say) 1 to 10 m/s by velocity energy, the vapour power delivery will increase ten<br>
times. Given the vapour ethylene (C,H4) at 265 K, 3.35 MPa having s = -1.519 which<br>
is combustible but not fired. Operations run at about -8°C and the liquid in 204 is also<br>
ethylene. Create an entropy level on leaving 205 to be on the liquid saturation iine.<br>
Energy from 206 will expand the fluid gas to cause a light density in column 203. On<br>
withdrawing power at 201 the temperature and pressure drops and the gas in 203 will<br>
be drenched by fog in 202, which enhances the vapour power production induced by<br>
gravity in the columns. No data for sample calculations avail.<br>
Example 11: Apply the reject heat of the thermal power station Lethaba (heat from coai)<br>
on applying the process described in example 4, operating at -8°C according to the<br>
example. The reject heat from the thermal process can be converted to power in total.<br>
Assume the six times 618 Megawatt Lethaba power station runs at 45% efficiency then<br>
the example referred to, will deliver an extra 4532 Megawatt and on top it will save about<br>
58 million cubic meter water from Vealdam applied to evaporate the power station reject<br>
heat.<br>
The twelfth aspect of the invention involves a system to run countercycle power<br>
production inside two only columns for fluid flow. The columns are coupled<br>
intermediately with iiquid conveyance pipes for drenching and pressure isolation, as<br>
shown in figure 21. In example 8 it was shown that the T-x behaviour in figure 20<br>
dominates evaporation and delivers high density CO2, well drenched, to rsach power<br>
converter 115 and yieid output power. The rate of power production will bs influenced<br>
by velocity inducer 121. The heat input 113 in figure 21 and the velocity generator 121<br>
dominate the production of the system.<br>
The thirteenth aspect of the invention applies internal fluid drenching in 2 columns as<br>
shown in figure 22. The condition of state of the two fluids in 203 and 202 impei<br>
circulation and output power generator 201 and heat input 20S establish a temperature<br>
according to production.<br>
Display 208 is designed to operate near the vapour saturation line of a fluid and<br>
operates well if the vapour density is high, e.g. for CO2 which can be applied to<br>
operate between +30°C and -100°C, depending on the quality of the input heat source.<br>
The Fourteenth aspect of the invention relates to the residues left over after water<br>
extraction by freezing. This is a field by itself. Reference may be made to mineral<br>
extraction from the dead sea and to sea salt extraction at Port Elizabeth, both as a result<br>
of water removal.<br>
The Fifteenth aspect of the invention relates to a practical design and application of<br>
the invention operating in water. The entire power station may float in water. The mass<br>
of air in the power station, functioning for example on water heat, water, a catalyst and<br>
air, can be increased to reach the air pressure required for optimal functioning. The air<br>
mass increases the density of the global power station. Consequently the power station<br>
will sink down the water and stabilise at the bottom of the water. On stabilisation the<br>
production of power may commence. Being stable at the bottom the power station<br>
cannot move round as a result of waves or water current during operation. If repairs<br>
have to be made, the high pressure air and/or water masses are released, the power<br>
station will float like a ship and normal open air repairs can be applied to the power<br>
station as a whole. The external water pressure counters internal pressure of the power<br>
station, yielding an economical design.<br>
The design is normally tested at twice the open air operational pressure. If the external<br>
water pressure is three times the operational pressure the internal air pressure can be<br>
raised to (1+3)=4 times the open air design pressure, eg, design the power station for<br>
one MPa, cover the power station with 300 m of water (supplying operating heat) and<br>
operate the power station at four MPa. This reduces the physical size of the power<br>
station to a fraction of the equivalent size of a 4 MPa open air power station.<br>
The sixteenth aspect of the invention relaies to the stability of an under water power<br>
station and the stability of power generating equipment in the power station. Displays<br>
12 in figure 2 shows high entropy fiuid(s) in a fraction of the circumferential coiumn area<br>
and low entropy fluid(s) in the other fraction of the column area. This is thermally well<br>
in rock but will cause tilting in water. Under water the circumferential column can be<br>
prevented from tilting by placing columns 14 and 15 in opposing positions in column 13<br>
and by choosing column flow speeds in 14 and 15 to equalize the mass distribution in<br>
column 13.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE<br>
INVENTION<br>
The layout 186 in figure 15 is the preferred layout. It lends itself to scaling, power<br>
production and the freezing of water to yield potable water. An appreciable advantage<br>
of the three column layout compared to the two and four column layouts vests in the fact<br>
that evaporation and condensation of the two fluids are mechanically enforced.<br>
The system 186 comprises three columns namely 191, 193 and 199. Column 199<br>
contains gas, drenched vapour and/or vapour. Column 193 contains iiquid, preheated<br>
liquid and/or low entropy vapour. Column 191 contains a fluid mixture consisting of iiquid<br>
pius vapour and/or gas. The system 136 further includes a pump 195 for circulating<br>
liquid or low entropy fluid by force; an electric power generator 1 94; a drenching<br>
disperser 187 a fluid mixer 134; a heat input 185. If required velocity energy for<br>
circulation may be applied at 187 by over pressurising pump 195.<br>
The three columns 191, 193 and 199 are filled with a mixture of a suitable fluid or pure<br>
fluid such as a refrigerants HPBO and F125 mixture or pure carbon dioxide. For ease of<br>
calculation purposes, it is assumed that coiurnn 193 and sump 196 contain iiquid only.<br>
To produce power the iiquefied fluid of high density 196 is elevated with pump 195 along<br>
193 and dispersed in 187 and 134. Partly or wholly gasified fluid 199 of low density is<br>
elevated against gravity by induced vacuum or mechanical circulation if necessary and<br>
mixed in 189, providing mechanical circulation. At 134 the action may include jetting<br>
and/or drenching.<br>
Note that the division iine 134 to. 143 in Figure 12 depicts a refrigeration cycle<br>
component and lines 134 to 141 in figure 11 depict a power cycle component. The fluid<br>
state of condition points of figure 13 are indicated in figure 15 showing the work output<br>
cancelled by gravity in 159 to 150 in column 199.<br>
The input work against gravity in figures 13 and 15 extends from 153 through pump 195<br>
to the high pressure stage 155 and pressure is decreased by flowing against gravity to<br>
state of condition 135 to 134 at the top of column 191. For ease of calculation assume<br>
a 50% mass mixture of gas and liquid at disperser 187. One kilogram per second fluid<br>
in columns 193 and 199 result in 2 kilogram fluid per second in column 191. The state<br>
of condition of fluid in column 191 change from 134 to 152. In passing through power<br>
generation 194 the state of condition becomes 135 to be separated into liquid 154 and<br>
gas 159. This completes the power generation countercycle in figure 15 as well as the<br>
thermodynamic cycle in figure 13. Assume a shaft length of zo from h = mgz0 in which<br>
h is enthalpy change of gas from 159 to 130.<br>
If m1 is the mass flow rate of liquid, m2 the mass flow rats of vapour and/or gas and zo<br>
the column depth the analysis of work in figure 13 shows.<br>
Work input in column 193 (153 to 1S7) = -m1gzo<br>
Work input in column 199 (155 to 153) = -m2gzo + hm2 = 0<br>
Work output in column 191 = rn1gzo + m2gzo - hm2<br>
Netto work output = hm2 + m2gzo = 0<br>
The theoretical analysis does not explain why work can be withdrawn from 152 to 135<br>
in figure 13. If a catalyst is included in the fluid it will decrease the temperature of 134<br>
and increase the temperature of 152, to produce more output power.<br>

heat may be circulated and that power output (194) can<br>

present 45 % efficiency of thermal power stations may be<br>
doubled. The invented layouts produce power from reject<br>
heat (185, 188) and saves the water required of cooling<br>
thermal power stations.</td>
