The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of pyridylcarboxylic am-<br>
ides and esters I<br><br>
wherein<br>
Hal represents a halogen atom;<br>
X represents O or NR2;<br>
R1 represents a C1-C6-alkyl or aryl group, wherein both groups may be sub-<br>
stituted by one or more halogen atoms, nitro, cyano, C1-C6-alkyl, C1-C6-<br>
haloalkyl or C1-C6-alkoxy groups;,<br>
R2 represents a hydrogen atom or a C1-C6-alkyl group;<br>
which comprises the following steps:<br>
(a)	heating a mixture consisting essentially of a trichloromethylpyridine II,<br><br>
wherein Hal has the meaning given,<br>
and 1.0 to 1.5 equivalents of concentrated sulfuric acid,<br>
characterized in that the trichloromethylpyridine II in a liquid form is added to the<br>
concentrated sulfuric acid at a temperature from 110 to 160 °C; and<br>
(b)	reacting the intermediate product obtained in step (a) with an amine or alco-<br>
hol III,<br><br>
wherein X and R1 have the meaning given,<br>
optionally in the presence of a solvent and/or a base.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention is a process for the preparation of<br>
(aryloxy)pyridylcarboxylic amides and esters IV<br><br>
wherein R1 and X have the meaning given, and<br><br><br>
R3 represents an aryl group, which may be substituted by one or more halogen<br>
atoms, nitro, cyano, C1-C6-alkyl, C1-C6-haloalkyl or C1-C6-alkoxy groups;<br>
wherein the pyridylcarboxylic amides and esters I or a salt thereof are prepared from<br>
a trichloromethylpyridine II according to the present invention and<br>
(c) are further reacted with an aromatic alcohol V,<br>
R3-OH	v,<br>
wherein R3 has the meaning given,<br>
optionally in the presence of a base.<br>
Pyridylcarboxylic amides and esters I are suitable intermediates for the preparation of a<br>
broad variety of compounds which are useful as agrochemicals or pharmaceuticals. In<br>
particular, they are key intermediates in the preparation of herbicidal phenoxypyridyl-<br>
carboxamides which are described for example in EP 0 447 004.<br>
The European patent application EP 0 646 566 suggests to hydrolyze trichloromethyl<br>
heteroarenes with water in the presence of chlorinated hydrocarbons and a Lewis acid<br>
and to react the resulting heteroarylcarbonyl chloride with an amine.<br>
However, this process causes problems with respect to the dosing rate and the exact<br>
equimolar dosing of water. Any excess of water will cause hydrolysis of the desired<br>
acid chloride compound and therefore reduce the yields. Moreover, in these days using<br>
chlorinated hydrocarbons is not desired because of environmental problems, and the<br>
amount of solvent used in the prior art procedure is high. Furthermore, the reaction<br>
time needed using water/1,2-dichloroethane is very long (24 h).<br>
The European patent application EP 0 899 262 discloses a process for the preparation<br>
of pyridylcarboxylic amides and esters in which sulfuric acid is added to a pyridyltri-<br>
chloromethane compound.<br>
However, this process causes problems since the intermediate formed solidifies at<br>
temperatures below 100 °C, but re-melting of this solidified intermediate is difficult due<br>
to decomposition under evolution of hydrochloric acid and sulphurtrioxide.<br>
It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide an efficient new process<br>
for the preparation of pyridylcarboxylic amides and esters in high yield and purity.<br>
The novel improved process avoids the disadvantages of the processes of the prior art<br>
and enables to carry out the production of pyridylcarboxamides and esters in technical<br>
scale and high yields using ready-available educts.<br><br>
Moreover the process according to the present invention has several advantages with<br>
respect to process safety compared to the process disclosed by EP 0 899 262 A:<br>
The mixture obtained in step (a) is not as sensitive to cooling during adding of the tri-<br>
chloromethypyridine II. The reaction mixture obtained during adding time is more stable<br>
and loss of heating would not cause solidification problems.<br>
Furthermore, when the sulfuric acid is added to the trichloromethylpyridine II as dis-<br>
closed by EP 0 899 262, the trichloromethylpyridine II shows the tendency to evaporate<br>
from the reaction mixture into the overhead system and is condensing and/or solidifying<br>
there. In addition to potential loss of yield, this may cause blockage of valves and vent<br>
lines representing a safety risk.<br>
So the process of the present invention clearly reduces the evaporation of the<br>
richloromethylpyridine II.<br>

skilled in the art from the following description and the appended claims.<br>

the absence of any solvent.<br>
Suitable solvents are aliphatic hydrocarbons such as mixtures of C5-C8-alkanes, aro-<br>
matic hydrocarbons such as toluene, o-, m- and p-xylene, and halogenated hydrocar-<br>
bons such as chlorobenzene.<br>
It is also possible to use mixtures of the solvents mentioned.<br>
Preference is given to a process according to the present invention wherein step (a)<br>
is carried out in the absence of any solvent.<br>
Preference is given to a process according to the present invention wherein in step<br>
(a) the concentrated sulfuric acid contains less than 3 % by weight of water.<br>
Step (a) is carried out in the presence of 1.0 to 1.5 equivalents, preferably of 1.1 to 1.4<br>
equivalents, particularly preferably of 1.25 to 1.35 equivalents of concentrated sulfuric<br>
acid.<br>
Preference is given to a process according to the present invention wherein in step (a)<br>
the trichloromethylpyridine II is added slowly, more preferably added in a time range<br>
of 1 to 5 hours to the concentrated sulfuric acid.<br>
Under these preferred reaction conditions the reaction of step (a) is as a rule com-<br>
pleted within 30 to 300 minutes, preferably within 45 to 240 minutes, in particular<br>
within 60 to 210 minutes.<br>
The trichloromethylpyridines II required are commercially available or can be prepared<br>
by halogenation of 2-trichloromethylpyridine (e.g. A. R. Katritzky, C. D. Johnson,<br>
Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1967, 6, 608-615).<br>
Step (b) of the process according to the present invention comprises reacting the in-<br>
termediate product obtained in step (a) with an amine or alcohol III optionally in the<br>
presence of an inert solvent and/or a base:<br><br><br>
The reaction of the intermediate product obtained in step (a) with an amine or alco-<br>
hol III is usually carried out at a temperature between ambient temperature and the<br>
reflux temperature of the reaction mixture, preferably at from 0 °C to 140 °C, particu-<br>
larly preferably at from 20 °C to120°C, most preferred at 40 °C to 100 °C in the pres-<br>
ence of an inert solvent and/or a base.<br>
As a rule step (b) can be carried out under reduced or elevated pressure, preferably it<br>
is carried out at ambient pressure.<br>
Step (b) of the reaction according to the invention may be carried out in the absence<br>
or presence of a solvent, which promotes the reaction or at least does not interfere<br>

or presence of a base.<br>
Suitable bases are, in general, organic bases, e.g. tertiary amines such as tri(CrC6-<br>
alkyl)amines (e.g. trimethylamine, triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine), N-<br>
methylpiperidine, pyridine, substituted pyridines such as collidine, lutidine, N-<br>
methylmorpholine and 4-dimethylaminopyridine and also bicyclic amines.<br>
The bases are generally employed in equimolar amounts, in excess or, if appropriate,<br>
they can be used as solvent. Preferably the bases are used in equimolar amounts.<br>
In general, the intermediate product obtained in step (a) and the amine or alcohol III<br>
are used in equimolar amounts.<br>
It might be advantageous to employ an excess of III based on the intermediate product.<br><br>
The resulting intermediate product obtained in step (a) is preferably reacted with the<br>
amine or alcohol III in a liquid form or upon dilution with an inert solvent.<br>
